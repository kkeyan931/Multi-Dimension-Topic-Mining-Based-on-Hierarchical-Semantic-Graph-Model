abstract

the role of the contribution from the fermion mass term in the axial
vector ward identity in generating the u(1) axial anomaly, both local and
global, is elucidated. gauge invariance requires the fermion to decouple
from the gauge eld if it is very heavy. this identies the adler-bell-jackiw
(abj) anomaly with the asymptotic limit of the sign reversed mass term.
in an instanton background, the chiral limit (m = 0) of the mass term does
not vanish but consists of contributions from fermion zero modes. space
time integral of these zero mode contributions exactly cancels, thanks to
the atiyah-singer index theorem, the integral of the abj anomaly and
suggests that the jacobian for global u(1) chiral transformation is trivial
even in an instanton background. this can be realised in the representation
of the fermion partition function in a weyl basis. the resolution of the
strong cp problem is thus achieved in an axionless physical world.

in chiral gauge theories the fermion partition function admits of a gauge
invariant representation but only at the cost of locality. implementation of
fermion averaging of the gauge current with the invariant partition func-
tion yields the current whose covariant derivative is the covariant anomaly.
with the covariant current as input one can derive an integrable current
whose covariant derivative is the minimal consistent anomaly obeying the
wess-zumino consistency condition. the distinction between the two cur-
rents disappears if either the covariant or the consistent anomaly vanishes.
this is realised only if the fermion belongs to an anomaly-free representa-
tion of the gauge group.

1 introduction

in classical eld theories there is a correspondence between a global symmetry

of the action and a conserved noether current. presence of short distance sin-

gularities which need to be regularised for mathematical consistency complicates

matters in quantum eld theory (qft). it may so happen that a regularisation

scheme with mandatory attributes, like gauge invariance in a gauge theory of

fermions, and at the same time consistent with the global symmetry cannot be

formulated or simply does not exist. traces of violation of the global symmetry

in the form of non-conservation of the noether current may survive as the regu-

lator is removed at the end of calculation. this is the genesis of anomalies and

anomalous ward identities in qft.

the topic of anomaly, in particular, axial anomaly came on the centrestage of par-

ticle physics research through the studies of neutral pion decay into two photons.
the decay rate 1.2 1016 per sec. was explained satisfactorily by steinberger1 in
1949 in terms of triangle diagrams (fig.1) with proton circulating in the fermion

loop. the linear divergence of the amplitude was regulated by the paulivillars
method. problem arose sixteen years later2, when decay rates obtained within

the framework of current algebra and partial conservation of axial vector current

(pcac) were invariably smaller than the data by three orders of magnitude.

a popular working hypothesis, pcac derives its dynamical basis in gauge the-

ories of fermion like quantum chromodynamics (qcd) from the naive operator

relation (or, equivalently, naive ward identity)

 (q53q) = 2m (q53q)

. . . (1.1)

which follows from eld equations, with q the quark doublet (u, d) and 3 the

isospin. one recognises in the left hand side the noether current corresponding
to the chiral symmetry u  ei5u, d  ei5d, which should be conserved at
the classical level in the chiral limit m = 0 of qcd. pcac is just the statement

that the mass term on the right hand side of (1.1) can be replaced by the neutral

2

pion eld

 (q53q) = fm2

0

. . . (1.2)

where f is the pion decay constant, m the pion mass, and 0 the pion eld. this

is an unexceptionable step since the mass term has the right quantum numbers

of a neutral pion and, therefore, can be regarded as the denition of the pion

eld in terms of quark constituents.

problem with pcac in 0  2 stemmed from the sutherlandveltman3 theo-
rem which states that substitution of the divergence of isospin axial current for

the neutral pion eld in the matrix element yields a null result for the decay
rate. coupled with the positive result of steinberger1, the unambiguous conclu-

sion that emerges from the theorem is that the inadequacy of the pcac relation

stems really from the naive relation (1.1) which is awed if quarks participate in

electromagnetic interactions. the missing element was diagnosed as an anomaly,
the adler-bell-jackiw (abj) anomaly4 in the noether current for chiral symme-

try

 (q53q) = 2m (q53q) (cid:18)nc

3 (cid:19) e2

162 ff

. . . (1.3)

where nc is the colour degree of freedom of quarks and f the electromagnetic

eld tensor. the abj anomaly, therefore, modies the naive pcac relation

(1.2) to

fm2

0 =  (q53q) +(cid:18)nc

3 (cid:19) e2

162 ff

the decay rate now calculated by substituting the anomaly term for the pion
eld in the matrix element for 0  2 is given by

(cid:16)0  2(cid:17) = (cid:18)nc
3 (cid:19)

2

 1.11  1016 sec1

. . . (1.4)

depending on how one looks at the result (1.4), it may be regarded as either a
signal success of the diagnosis of the problem in 0  2 as due to anomaly, or
in the light of later developments, a prediction of the number of colour degrees

of freedom nc = 3 in qcd.

3

success in 0  2 problem brought into limelight the scenario of breaking sym-
metries at the classical level through anomalies in quantum eld theories. gauge

theories become inconsistent if gauge symmetry is violated through anomaly.

cancellation of anomalies, therefore, constitutes an important constraint in build-

ing models for physical gauge theories with chiral coupling to fermions. global

chiral anomaly seems to play a key role in discussing physical eects associated

with topologically nontrivial gauge eld congurations.

2 axial anomaly and fermion decoupling

in a gauge theory of fermion there is a contradiction at the quantum level between

chiral invariance and gauge symmetry. the abj anomaly, or in the more general

context of non-abelian gauge theories of fermion, the anomaly in the u(1) axial

vector current, arises because gauge invariance is to be preserved for consistency
of the theory. the contradiction is transparent in the condition for decoupling5

of the fermion from the background gauge eld when it is very heavy. for the

divergence of the u(1) axial vector current the decoupling condition assumes the

form of an anomalous ward identity

h(cid:16) (x)5(x)(cid:17)i = 2mh (x)5(x)i  lim

mh2mh (x)5(x)ii

. . . (2.1)

where h i denotes that the fermion degrees of freedom are integrated out. as
we shall see below, (2.1) follows directly from gauge invariance and is known as
adler6 condition in qed. eq.(2.1) will still be compatible with chiral symmetry

and a conserved u(1) axial vector current would emerge in the chiral limit m = 0

if the second term on the right hand side were to vanish. but this is not to be.

the asymptotics in eld theory gives in the innite mass limit the abj anomaly

figure 1: triangle diagrams

to motivate the decoupling condition (2.1) we consider in qed the amplitude

for creating two photons with momenta and polarisation (p, ) and (k, ) by the
axial vector current j5(x) = (x)5(x)

hp, ; k, |j5(0)|0i = (p)(k)m(p, k, m)

the key to the analysis is the rosenberg7 tensor decomposition (see fig.1)

m = ka(p, k, m)+pk [pb(p, k, m) + kc(p, k, m)]+[(k, )  (p, )]

. . . (2.3)

which follows from parity and lorentz invariance.

not all the form factors are independent. the form factor a which gives the

divergence of the axial vector current

(p + k)m = pk [a(p, k, m) + a(k, p, m)]

. . . (2.4)

is determined through gauge invariance by the form factors b and c

a(p, k, m) = p2b(p, k, m) + p.kc(p, k, m)

. . . (2.5)

5

the form factors b and c are of dimensions [mass]2, and, therefore, in pertur-

bation theory they are represented by highly convergent amplitudes which vanish
as m2 for large fermion mass

lim
m

b(p, k, m) = lim
m

c(p, k, m) = 0

thus gauge invariance (2.5) guarantees that the divergence of the amplitude for
the axial vector current given in (2.4) vanishes in the asymptotic m   limit

lim
m

(p + k)m = 0

. . . (2.6)

in perturbation theory the amplitude m for the triangle diagram is linearly

divergent. the leading divergence, however, drops out due to symmetric inte-

gration of loop momentum leaving a potential logarithmic divergence, which can

appear only in the form factor a in (2.3). gauge invariance (2.5) rules out even

this residual logarithmic divergence.

the above observations suggest that the potential anomaly represented by the

second term in (2.1) must be nite and independent of regularisation scheme. to

verify this we start by calculating

lim

mh2mh (x)5(x)ii = lim

mh2mhx|t r5(id/ + m)1|xii ,

. . . (2.7)

where, to conform to our discussions in the subsequent sections, we work in

euclidean metric and write for the hermitian dirac operator

d/ =  (i  ga)

. . . (2.8)

with a  aa

ta, the gauge potential.

our strategy is to develop the green function appearing in (2.7) in a perturbative

series

(id/ + m)1 = (id/ + m)g

6

with

g = (d/2 + m2)1

= g0  gg0v g0 + g2g0v g0v g0 + . . .

. . . (2.9)

the free part is g0 = (p2 + m2)1 with p = i the momentum operator.
the potential gv has two pieces

gv = gv0 +

1
2

f

with  = 1
2i (  ). the rst piece gv0 is at most linear in p and
independent of matrices. the trace with 5 in (2.7) starts to be nonvanishing
only from terms of order g2 onwards in the perturbative expansion (2.9) and one

obtains (2.2)

lim

mh2mh (x)5(x)ii = lim

mh2m2hx|t r (5g)|xii =

g2
162 trf(x)f(x)

note that the nal result is local. all nonlocalities as well as contributions from

higher order terms in the perturbative series (2.9) drop out in the innite mass
limit m  .

in the decoupling condition (2.1) one can set the mass term on the right hand side

to zero in the chiral limit m = 0. the anomalous ward identity thus obtained

h(cid:16) 5(cid:17)im=0 = 

g2
162 trff

. . . (2.10)

shows that the u(1) axial vector current, i.e. the noether current corresponding

to global chiral symmetry

  ei5,

  ei5,

. . . (2.11)

of the massless dirac operator (2.8), is not conserved. the divergence of the

current is just the abj anomaly which is responsible for the two photon decay

of neutral pion discussed in the preceding section.

we note that in renormalisable theories in perturbative framework the decou-

pling condition (2.1), which is a special example of the decoupling theorem of
appelquist and carazzone5, is correct to all orders of perturbation, just as the

7

adlerbardeen8 theorem assures us that the anomalous axial vector ward iden-

tity (2.10) is not aected by radiative corrections in qed.

it should be remarked that setting the mass term to zero in (2.1), as was done

in obtaining (2.10), may not always be legitimate in the chiral limit m = 0 if

the gauge eld is treated nonperturbatively. the euclidean dirac operator (2.8)

has zero modes if the background gauge eld has a nontrivial topology. in this

scenario the chiral limit of the mass term does not vanish and, as we shall see in

the next section, consists precisely of the zero modes of the dirac operator.

3 path integral approach to anomaly

in a seminal work fujikawa9 interpreted the abj anomaly within the path in-

tegral framework as arising from the nontrivial jacobian of the fermion measure

under chiral transformation. in euclidean metric, considered by fujikawa, the

partition function which generates fermion green functions in a background gauge

eld conguration may be written as

zf [a]  z d exp(cid:20)z (id/ + m)d4x(cid:21)

. . . (3.1)

where d is the integration measure for fermion and d/ is the euclidean dirac

operator dened in (2.8). fermion green functions which are normalised expec-

tation values of any product o of fermion elds are obtained from the functional

integral (3.1)

hoi =

1

zf [a] z do exp(cid:20)z (id/ + m)d4x(cid:21)

. . . (3.2)

with -matrices chosen hermitian, the dirac operator (2.8) is also hermitian with

real eigenvalues n and orthonormal eigenfunctions n(x)

d/n(x) = nn(x),

m(x)n(x)d4x = mn

z +

. . . (3.3)

each nonzero eigenvalue n has its chirally conjugate partner n with eigen-
functions n

d/n = nn, n = 5n

. . . (3.4)

8

in perturbative eld theories one is interested in gauge eld congurations with

only trivial topology. for such congurations the kernel space of the euclidean
dirac operator (2.8) is of dimension zero. this means that the set {n(x)} with
nonzero eigenvalues constitute a complete basis in function space. the dirac eld

(x) can be expanded in this basis as

(x) = x (an + an5) n(x)

. . . (3.5)

where an are complex-valued grassmann generators. the four degrees of free-

dom corresponding to each mode of the dirac eld is accounted for if we split

an as

with ,  real valued.

an = n + in

there are ambiguities10,11,12 on the issue whether in euclidean metric  should
be treated as independent of . for the present, we follow the popular ansatz10
and expand (x) with an independent set of grassmann generators {bn},

(x) = x +

n (x)(cid:16)bn + bn5(cid:17)

. . . (3.6)

the representations for (x) and (x) together with orthonormality of the eigen-

functions (3.3) yield for the fermion action

sf (m) = r (x)(id/ + m)(x)d4x

= ph(in + m) bnan + (in + m) bnani

the integration measure for the fermion elds in the basis {n(x)} is

d  ndbndandbndan

. . . (3.7)

. . . (3.8)

the standard rules of integration of grassmann generators now yield for the

partition function (3.1) the desired result

zf [a] = n (2

n + m2)
= det (id/ + m)

. . . (3.9)

this conrms the correctness of the choice of the measure (3.8).

9

ward identities, whether normal or anomalous, are obtained in path integral

framework from the requirement that the partition function is invariant under

innitesimal symmetry transformations of the variables of integration. to derive

the ward identity corresponding to chiral symmetry one implements a local
chiral transformation of the variables of integration (x), (x) in the partition

function (3.1)

(x)  (x) = (1 + i(x)5) (x)
(x)  (x) = (x) (1 + i(x)5)

. . . (3.10)

the fermion measure (3.8) changes and the new measure corresponding to the
transformed variables of integration is given by d

the fermion action also changes and the new action is given by

sf (m)  s

f (m) = z d4xh (id/ + m) + i(x)(cid:16)(cid:16) 5(cid:17) + 2m 5(cid:17)i

. . . (3.13)

invariance of the partition function (3.1) under the innitesimal local chiral trans-

formation (3.10) now gives the anomalous axial ward identity

it is easy to recognise (3.14) as the decoupling condition (2.1) of the preceding

it is clear that the left hand side of (3.16) should be augmented by zero modes

if the dirac operator admits of them. zero modes always appear with denite
chiralities, i = 1

d/ 0i = 0,

50i = i0i

. . . (3.17)

this is because, in its kernel space the dirac operator commutes with 5. in the

presence of zero modes the left hand side of (3.16) needs to be augmented by

their contributions, i.e.,

where  is the winding number (pontryagin index) of the gauge eld and n+(n)

is the number of positive (negative) chirality zero modes. eigenmodes corre-

sponding to nonzero eigenvalues do not contribute to the space time integral

(3.19) because n is orthogonal to 5n. note that nontrivial winding number,
 6= 0, is realised through instantonlike conguration of the gauge eld.

the presence of zero modes has profound impact on the chiral limit of the fermion

mass term on the right hand side of the anomalous axial ward identity

h( 55)i = 2mh 5i 

g2
162 trff

. . . (3.22)

the mass term, therefore, has now a nontrivial chiral limit consisting precisely

of the zero modes, and the chiral limit of the axial ward identity is not exactly

what was obtained in the perturbative framework of the preceding section

h( 5)im=0 = 2x i+

0i0i 

g2
162 trff

. . . (3.23)

the zero modes in the extra piece appearing on the right hand side arise from

instantonlike conguration of the gauge eld and, therefore, could not have been

accessed in a perturbative framework.

it is of great interest to note that the zero mode terms which appear explicitly

on the right hand side of (3.23) are exactly cancelled by similar terms contained

now (see (3.18)) in the abj anomaly. thus, irrespective of whether or not the

gauge eld conguration gives rise to zero modes, the chiral limit of the local

axial anomaly comprises of only nonzero eigenmodes of the dirac operator

h( 5)im=0 = 2 x|n|6=0(cid:16)+

n 5n + +

n5n(cid:17)

. . . (3.24)

we, therefore, conclude that the space-time integral of the chiral limit of the

divergence of the axial vector current always vanishes. this follows from the

orthogonality of n and 5n if one uses (3.24) or from the atiyahsinger index

theorem if instead one uses (3.23)

z h( 55)im=0d4x = 0

. . . (3.25)

this, as we shall see later, has a profound impact on issues of physics related to

global chiral anomaly.

4 chiral gauge theories and the covariant and

consistent anomalies

the abj anomaly in the u(1) axial vector ward identity constitutes an unam-

biguous evidence of a fundamental incompatibility of chiral invariance and gauge

symmetry in regularisation scheme in perturbative framework of quantum eld

theory. in a vector-like gauge theory, such as qcd, chiral invariance is an ex-

pendable attribute and the abj anomaly results from strict adherence to gauge

symmetry.

in chiral gauge theories where gauge elds are coupled chirally to

fermions in the dirac operator

with (x) = taa(x) the gauge function. dimensional regularisation, popular in
perturbative gauge theories, has serious problem with 5 = 1
4! . the
totally antisymmetric tensor of rank four  does not admit of suitable gener-

alisation to arbitrary space-time dimensions. thus, one is yet to nd a consistent

and systematic scheme for regulating divergences in chiral gauge theories in weak

coupling perturbation in the continuum.

on lattice, the nite spacing a between lattice sites provides a built-in regulari-

sation of all short distance singularities in eld theories. here too, the prospects

for a consistent formulation of chiral gauge theory are not really bright. the ma-

jor problem on lattice is the species doublers of fermion and their removal. the

13

doublers appear as unwanted zeros of the fourier transform of the free dirac op-

erator on lattice, over and above the zero at the origin of momentum space which

correspond to the physical fermion. in the naive dirac operator ( sin (pa) /a)
the doublers are located at the edges of the brillouin zone (/a)  p  (/a).
the doublers are not specic for the naive dirac operator. according to the cel-
ebrated theorem of nielsen and ninomiya14 these are generic and can be avoided

only at a price, by breaking explicitly locality and/or chiral symmetry in the
dirac operator. the most popular model for lattice fermion, the wilson model15,

removes the doublers by giving them masses of the order of the lattice cut-o

o(1/a)

dw (p) =  sin(pa)/a + ir (1  cos(pa)) /a

. . . (4.3)

gauge invariance is implemented simply through link variables as in all lattice

models. but the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry for nonzero r makes the

model patently inappropriate for chiral gauge theories. current spurt in interest

in the subject stems mainly from the realisation that for lattice dirac operators
d obeying the ginspargwilson16 relation

5d + d5 = ad5d,

. . . (4.4)

chiral symmetry is restored and species doublers are removed in the continuum
limit17. the issue of nonlocality implied in the ginspargwilson relation, partic-
ularly in the context of chiral gauge theories, is yet to be resolved 18.

covariant anomaly19 : apart from the absence of a consistent and system-

atic regularisation scheme, chiral gauge theories are, in general, aicted with

anomalies in the gauge current. the dirac operator (4.1) in chiral gauge theory
is non-hermitian. a fallout of this is that fujikawas9 recipe for constructing a

gauge invariant partition function, which assumes a hermitian dirac operator,
needs to be modied. the dirac operator d in (4.1) maps  into the space
of spinors in the domain of d+. the eigenvalue equations (3.3) are, therefore
replaced by

dn = nn,

d+n = nn,

. . . (4.5)

14

n are real, nonnegative and constitute the eigenvalue spectrum of dd+
where 2
and d+d. the sets of eigen functions {n} and {n} of d+d and dd+ respec-
tively constitute an orthonormal basis for expanding  and 

 = x ann,

bn+

in terms of the grassmann generators an, bn. the fermion measure dened as

d[a] = ndbndan

. . . (4.7)

is a gauge invariant functional of a and yields the partition function19

zinv[a]  r d[a] exp[r dd4x]

= (detd+d)1/2 = (cid:16)det dd+(cid:17)1/2

. . . (4.8).

both d+d and dd+ change by a similarity transformation under gauge trans-
formation. the representation (4.8) is thus formally gauge invariant.

the chiral gauge current

(cid:20) ta

2

(1  5)(cid:21)

. . . (4.9)

gauge invariant regularisation can be implemented by suppressing large eigen-

values and the current thus obtained transforms covariantly and is called the

covariant current.

formal application of eld equations suggest that the gauge current should be

covariantly conserved. this, however, may not be true for the fermion averaged

consistent anomaly19,20: in perturbative treatment of chiral gauge theories

the fermion measure in the partition function is independent of the gauge eld. a

fallout of this is that, unlike zinv[a] in (4.8), the perturbative partition function

and hence the eective action w [a] need not be gauge invariant. the gauge

current with fermion averaging implemented through this perturbative partition

function

since it is dened in (4.14) through the functional derivative of the eective action
w [a]. the current j a

w (x) is called the consistent current and its covariant

derivative

ga(x)  j a

w (x)  f abcab

w (x)

thus the consistent anomaly ga

w (x), representing as it does the gauge variation

of the eective action w [a], is given by

ga

w (x) = la(x)w [a]

. . . (4.18)

the algebra of the generators

hla(x), lb(x)i = f abca(x  x)lc(x)

. . . (4.19)

shows that the consistent anomaly must obey the wess-zumino21 consistency

condition

la(x)gb

w (x)  lb(x)ga
on the other hand, the anomaly ga
consistent current j a

w (x)

w (x) = f abc4(x  x)gc
w (x) is a measure of the non-covariance of the

with the wess-zumino consistency condition

la(x)gb(x)  lb(x)ga(x) = 2f abc4(x  x)gc(x),

. . . (4.22)

where the factor 2 on the right hand side spoils consistency. thus, the anomaly

itself is a measure of the inconsistency. the origin of the inconsistency may

be traced to the fermion measure d[a] given by (4.7) for averaging of the gauge
current in the denition (4.10) of the covariant current j a
(x). a nontrivial co-
variant anomaly ga(x) corresponds to a nontrivial dependence of the measure

d[a] on the gauge eld. this is suggested also from the observation that the

where zinv[a] is the gauge invariant partition function (4.8), has all the attributes,

it is covariant, consistent and anomaly free. the price that one pays for this

perfect current is a high degree of nonlinearity.

the above analysis shows that the distinction between covariant and consistent

currents disappears if and only if the anomaly in either current vanishes. the

fundamental requirement that the chiral gauge theory is free of either anomaly

imposes the unique constraint on the group generators of the chiral fermions

tr (ta {tb, tc}) = 0

. . . (4.26)

which is symmetric in all the indices. an interesting application in the standard

model is to take ta = q, the matrix of electric charge, and tb, tc the isospin

matrices. the constraint trq = 0 is obeyed in the standard model since each

generation of quark doublet of three colours is paired with a lepton doublet.

5 global chiral anomaly and the strong cp

problem.

global u(1) axial anomaly is the sine qua non for the strong cp problem. the

problem consists in the gross disagreement in the experimental data for the cp

violating electric dipole moment of neutron (edmn) which are consistent with a

null result and theoretical estimates that invariably give a large value. strong cp

18

problem provides the unique arena where the concept of a global chiral anomaly

is confronted with direct experimental data.

the two possible sources for cp violation in qcd action

sqcd = sg +z q(id/)qd4x + mz qe2iew5qd4x + qcds

. . . (5.1)

are the chiral phase ew in the quark mass which arises from the electroweak

sector of the standard model, and the qcd vacuum term with parameter qcd

qcds = qcd

g2

322 z trffd4x

. . . (5.2)

in (5.1) sg represents the contributions from the gauge elds. for gauge elds

with nontrivial topology the coecient of qcd in (5.2) gives precisely the winding
number  6= 0,

 =

. . . (5.3)

g2

322 z trffd4x

the chiral phase in the mass term in (5.1) can be transformed away by relabelling

the quark elds

q  eiew5q,

q  qeiew5

there relabelling, however, introduces a jacobian

j(ew) = exp"iew

g2

162 z trffd4x#

. . . (5.4)

. . . (5.5)

where the coecient of ew in the exponent is 2, i.e. twice the winding number

of the gauge eld conguration, which is nontrivial precisely in sectors where

instantons live. the relabelling, therefore, merely shifts ew to qcd giving an
eective 

 = qcd  2nf ew

. . . (5.6)

where nf is the number of quark avours. all physical quantities in this sce-
nario, therefore, depends on  and not on qcd or ew individually. theoretical
estimates22 for cp-violating edmn are all in the range

n    10151e.cm
dth

19

. . . (5.7)

experimental data dex

n  1026e.cm, therefore, suggests  < 109. such a small
value requires near cancellation of two parameters qcd and ew as in (5.6),

which arise from completely dierent sectors of the standard model. this is the

strong cp problem, which is essentially a problem of ne tuning.

attempts to remedy the strong cp problem by invoking a spontaneously broken

global chiral u(1) symmetry, the peccei-quinn symmetry, have been pursued
vigorously22. the idea essentially is that the eective  becomes a dynamical

variable in this scenario involving the eld of the pseudoscalar goldstone boson
associated with the broken peccei-quinn symmetry. the dynamical  could then

settle down to a minimum consistent with the conservation of p and cp. the

axion has been virtually ruled out by experiments and the strong cp problem in

its original formulation is no closer to a resolution now than it was at the time
of its conception22.

question of global chiral anomaly : in view of the prevailing impasse, with

axion window virtually closed, it is worthwhile to reexamine critically the basic

premises that lead up to the strong cp problem. the question of a nontrivial

global chiral anomaly clearly stands out as the most vulnerable among these basic

premises.

the chiral limit of the axial vector ward identity in a instanton-like background

gauge eld was given in (3.23)

h(cid:16) 5(cid:17)im=0 = 2x i+

0i0i 

g2
162 trff

. . . (3.23)

where the zero modes 0i(x) are a fallout of the nontrivial winding number  of

the gauge eld. it is natural to identify the right hand side of (3.23) as the density

of global chiral anomaly in an instanton-like background. its space-time integral,

the global chiral anomaly, vanishes by the atiyah-singer index theorem (3.19).

this patently contradicts a nontrivial jacobian as in (5.5), the cornerstone of the

strong cp problem. the popular perception of a nontrivial global chiral anomaly

and hence a nontrivial jacobian (5.5) not only leads to the strong cp problem

20

but is aicted with contradictions in the chiral limit.

the source of these aictions is easily traced to the popular identication of the

partition function with the determinant of the dirac operator

zf [a]6=0 = det(id/ + m)

. . . (5.8)

which is unphysical in the chiral limit because of zero modes. a key to the prob-
lem is provided by the theorem23 which states that there are no wrong chirality

zero modes of the dirac operator d/, i.e., in the atiyah-singer index theorem

(3.19) positive (negative) chirality zero modes n+(n) are associated with posi-

tive (negative) winding number . thus

dim ker(drdl) = 0,   0
dim ker(dldr) = 0,   0

where dl, dr = d+

l are the weyl components of the dirac operator d/

d/ =   0 dl
0 !

dr

. . . (5.9)

. . . (5.10)

the theorem (5.9), therefore, assures that the partition functions dened as

zf [a]0 = det (drdl + m2)
zf [a]0 = det (dldr + m2)

. . . (5.11)

in the respective gauge eld sectors, are not aicted, unlike (5.8), with zero

modes and hence have smooth chiral limits. in the trivial sector  = 0 the two

representations coincide.

the representations in (5.11) require that instead of the dirac basis {n(x)} of
sec.3 we use eigenfunction sets of weyl operators drdl and dldr appropriate
respectively for positive and negative . thus for   0, one writes
nl(x) !

nl(x) !, n(x) =

2 

dlnl(x)

1
n

1

2 

. . . (5.12)

n(x) =

1

dlnl(x)

1
n

where nl(x) are orthonormal eigenfunctions of the positive denite hermitian

operator drdl

drdlnl(x) = 2

nnl(x)

. . . (5.13)

21

n > 0 provides a complete set of functions in the weyl

the set {nl(x)} with 2
basis in   0 sector. in the resulting axial vector ward identity24
h(cid:16) 5(cid:17)i>0 = 2mh 5i ( g2
162 trff x +

0i0i) . . . (5.14)

the contribution from the mass term on the right hand side now vanishes smoothly

in the chiral limit. the global chiral anomaly given by the space-time integral

of the chiral limit of the four divergence of the axial vector current, therefore,

vanishes and instead of (5.5), we now have

j(ew)6=0 = exp"iewz ( g2

162 trff x i+

0i0i) d4x#

= 1

. . . (5.15)

the vanishing of the global chiral anomaly means that the chiral phase ew in

the quark mass in (5.1) is unphysical and can be transformed away trivially by

a global chiral rotation (5.4) without aecting in any way qcd. the vacuum

parameter qcd remains invariant. the crux of the strong cp problem, the

problem of ne tuning, therefore, melts away. cp symmetry is ensured simply

through the natural choice qcd = 0.

6 concluding remarks

ever since its conception in the context of the problem of neutral pion decay into

two photons, chiral anomaly has been a topic of abiding interest and challenge

in particle physics. the interest stems in a large measure from the need to

couple fermions chirally to gauge elds in building models in particle physics.

the challenge consists in formulating a consistent and systematic regularisation

scheme in chiral gauge theories.

the paper highlights and elucidates the seminal role of the mass term in the axial

22

vector ward identity in generating the local abj anomaly and the global u(1)

axial anomaly. gauge invariance demands that the fermion gets decoupled from

the divergence of the u(1) axial vector current if it is very heavy. this identies

the abj anomaly with the asymptotic limit of the fermion mass term with sign

reversed. on the other hand, the chiral limit (m = 0) of the same mass term

does not vanish and consists of contributions from fermion zero modes when the
background gauge eld has a nontrivial topology  6= 0. the space time integral
of the chiral limit cancels the integral of the abj anomaly, the (signreversed)

asymptotic limit of the mass term, thanks to the atiyah-singer index theorem.

this suggests, contrary to popular perception, that the jacobian for global u(1)

chiral transformation is trivial even in an instanton background. the triviality

of the jacobian is realised in a representation of the fermion partition function

in the weyl basis (5.11) which has a null kernel space. the point of interest in

all this is that there is no strong cp problem in an axionless physical world.

current interest in lattice formulation of chiral gauge theory centres around dirac
operators for lattice fermion which obey the ginsparg-wilson16 relation (4.4).

apart from redening chiral symmetry on lattice, the ginsparg-wilson relation
introduces nonlocality18. it is interesting to note that in continuum formulation

also it is possible to dene a gauge invariant partition function (4.8) but only at

the cost of locality. fermion averaging of the gauge current implemented with

this partition function yields the covariant current. the consistent current which

obeys integrability, can be generated with the covariant current as input. the

covariant derivative of the consistent current thus obtained yields the minimal

anomaly which obeys the wess-zumino consistency condition. both the anoma-

lies, covariant and consistent, and the distinction between the two currents vanish

if the fermion belongs to anomaly free representation (4.26).
