(5a) implies (x, x) , whereas eqn. (5b) conveniently formulates parallel transport covariant gamma matrices. finally, eqn. (5c) says (x, x) covariantly constant along geodesic parallel transport. would like evaluate particular property (x, x), namely covariant derivative. therefore, combine eqns. (5a) (5b) (x, x) = (x, x) g dierentiate covariantly respect x obtain d(x, x) = d(x, x) (a + c)(x, x) g ( n + gn), (6) (7) used property (2c) vector parallel propagator. now, use eqn. (6) second term right hand side eqn. (7) multiply , yields 2d(x, x) d/ (x, x) = d/ (x, x) thus, multiplication leads g + (a + c)( n nn)(x, x). (8) solution (2 n)d/ (x, x) = d/ (x, x) g , d/ (x, x) = bn(x, x), (9) b function geodesic distance . then, substituting eqn. (9) eqn. (8) yields 2d(x, x) = 2bn(x, x) + (a + c)(n nn)(x, x). moreover, multiplying n using eqn. (5c) one determines b b = 1 2 (n 1)(a + c). therefore, one nally obtains d(x, x) = 1 2 (a + c) (n n) (x, x). (10) completeness, also give expression d(x, x). easily obtained eqn. (10) using eqn. (5a) given d(x, x) = 1 2 (a + c)(x, x)(cid:16) n n(cid:17) .

(12) here, written indices explicitly order emphasize bi-spinor equation. shall henceforth omit indices. now, make general ansatz s(x, x) =  (x, x), (13) functions geodesic distance still determined. substitute ansatz (13) eqn. (12) and, using eqn. (10), obtain two coupled dierential equations + + 1 2 1 2 (n 1)(a c) = (n 1)(a + c) = 0, (x x) pg(x) , (14) (15) prime denotes dierentiation respect . order proceed, multiply eqn.

(16), consider rst x 6= x make substitution z = cos2 2r . yields dierential equation 4z (cid:21) (z) = 0. n 1 then, writing (z) = z(z), one obtains hypergeometric equation , (cid:20)z(1 z) m2r2 (1 2z) dz d2 dz2 + (n 1)2 n 2 4 h(a, b; c; z)(z) = 0, h(a, b; c; z) = z(1 z) d2 dz2 +  dz ab hypergeometric operator, parameters = n 2 i|m|r, b = n 2 + i|m|r, c = n 2 + 1. solution eqn. (23) singular z = 1  (z) = f(a, b; c; z) = f(n/2 i|m|r, n/2 + i|m|r; n/2 + 1; z), proportionality constant. therefore, (z) (z) = z f(n/2 i|m|r, n/2 + i|m|r; n/2 + 1; z). (21) (22) (23a) (23b) (23c) (24) (25) determine constants matching singularity eqn. (16). equivalent demanding singularity = 0 strength case rn. one nds eqn. (25) whereas rn have, eqn.
