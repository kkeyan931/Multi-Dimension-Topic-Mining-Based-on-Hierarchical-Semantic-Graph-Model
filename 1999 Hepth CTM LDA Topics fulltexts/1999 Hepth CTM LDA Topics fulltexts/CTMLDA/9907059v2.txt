the principle of invariance of the c-number symmetric bracket is used to derive both the quantum
operator commutator relation [q, p] = ih and the time-dependent schrodinger equation. a c-number
dynamical equation is found which leads to the second quantized eld theory of bosons and fermions.

i. introduction:

occasionally in the development of quantum theory and quantum eld theory, something fundamental and simple
is overlooked. this is the case with the introduction of the ordered poisson bracket and its consequences.
it is
shown in this paper that the time-dependent schrodinger equation and the commutation relation between position
and momentum, the quantum bracket [q, p] = ih [1], is in fact a consequence of the principle of invariance under
a one parameter canonical transformation of the c-number symmetric bracket. furthermore, the relation between
expectation values and classical dynamics, and the probability interpretation of quantum theory are a consequence
of this procedure. in addition, a c-number dynamical equation is derived, which provides the fundamental condition
for the boson and fermion operator commutation relations.

although the idea of the symmetric analog of the poisson bracket has appeared in the theory of dierential geometry
and algebraic ideals [2], and in classical constraint dynamics [3], its clear relevance to fundamental physics has not until
now been demonstrated. the idea of the ordered poisson bracket and related symmetric and antisymmetric brackets
has been introduced in [4] to provide a c-number analog of the usual boson commutator and fermion anticommutator
for quantum elds. from the basic concept of the ordered bracket, the antisymmetric and symmetric brackets are
dened. the principle of invariance of the antisymmetric bracket under a one parameter canonical transformation
leads to hamiltons dynamical equations, and the generator of this transformation is the hamiltonian. what is new
and surprising is that the analogous property for the symmetric bracket leads to schrodingers equation, and the
generator of the one parameter canonical transformation in this case is the expectation value of the hamiltonian
operator. furthermore; these c-number brackets provide a natural derivation of the boson and fermion commutation
relations, when operator innitesimal time development equations are sought which have the c-number equations as
a displacement state expectation value.

in this paper dimensionless phase space coordinates are used such that qi  qi/qo, pi  pi/po, and qopo = h. for
a given mass mo, the natural units of length, time, and energy are respectively,  = 2h/moc, to = 2h/moc2, and
eo = moc2 = ho. if mo is chosen to be the planck mass, mp = phc/gn , then these units can be expressed in

terms of natural physical constants(plancks reduced constant h, the speed of light c, and the newtonian gravitational
constant gn ).

ii. complex phase space and c-number brackets

ordinary classical dynamics is usually discussed in terms of real-valued phase space vector variables of the form
(~q, ~p). however, its relation to quantum theory and to fermion systems is much more transparent if one changes these

university, august 9-14, 1999.

real phase space vector variables to the complex-valued dimensionless phase space vector variables ~a  (~q + i~p/)/2
and their complex conjugates ~a  = (~q  i~p)/2. in terms of components of both of these types of phase space vector

variables, the usual poisson bracket of ordinary classical dynamics is

{f, g} xk

k(cid:19) .

(2.1)

=  ixk

from the second poisson bracket representation given above, we abstract the semi-bracket, which we call the ordered
poisson bracket,

{f  g} = xk

f
ak

g
a
k

=

f
~a 

g
~a .

(2.2)

we note that while {f  g} is linear in each of its two argument functions f and g, it is neither antisymmetric
nor symmetric under their interchange. however, it does satisfy the identity {f  g} = {g  f }, which is in
algebraic correspondence with the hermitian conjugation formula for the product of two hilbert-space operators, i.e.,
f g = (g f ). from eq. (2.2) we dene the c-number symmetric and antisymmetric brackets

where we note {f, g} = i{f, g}. we readily calculate the c-number symmetric and antisymmetric brackets for the
components of ~a and ~a ,

{f, g}  {f  g}  {g  f},

(2.3)

{ai, aj} = 0 = {a

i , a

j},

{ai, a

j} = ij = {a

j , ai}.

(2.4)

innitesimal canonical transformations, which leave the brackets invariant, are now introduced. the canonical
transformations of ordinary classical dynamics are mappings of the complex phase space vectors ~a  ~a(~a, ~a ) and
~a   ~a(~a, ~a ), which preserve the antisymmetric c-number poisson bracket relations among the complex phase
space vector components. also we consider the canonical transformations of complex vector phase space mappings
which preserve the c-number symmetric bracket relations among the complex phase space vector components.
it
is important to note that the complex phase space vectors are related to ordinary classical mechanics phase space
coordinates in the case of the antisymmetric bracket; however, in the symmetric bracket case they correspond to the
expansion coecients of either quantum wave functions or the c-number limit of quantum elds.

specializing now to innitesimal phase space transformations ~a  ~a = ~a + ~a(~a, ~a ), we readily calculate the

c-number antisymmetric and symmetric brackets for the components of ~a and ~a to rst order in ~a and ~a ,

{ai, aj} =

(aj)

i 

a

(ai)

a
j

,

{a

(a

,

{ai, a

j} = ij +

(ai)

aj

+

(a
j )
a
i

= {a

j , ai}.

(2.5)

(2.6)

if we now impose the requirement that this innitesimal phase space vector transformation preserves the c-number
antisymmetric or symmetric bracket relations among the complex phase space vectors, we obtain the three equations,

(aj)

a
i

= 

(ai)

a

(a

ai

(a

aj

= 

(ai)

aj

(a
j )
a
i

= 0.

(2.7)

the last of these equations is independent of the value of the  symbol, and it is satised in particular for one-
parameter innitesimal ~a which are of the form

ai =  i()

g
a
i

,

a

j = i()

g
aj

,

(2.8)

where  is a real-valued innitesimal parameter and g(~a, ~a , ) is a real-valued generating function. we thus can
readily verify that the last equation in eq. (2.7) is satised. from the two immediately preceding equations eq. (2.8),

2

we obtain the form of the equation which governs any continuous one-parameter trajectory of sequential innitesimal
canonical transformations in the complex vector phase space:

i

dai
d

=

g
a
i

or  i

da
i
d

=

g
ai

.

(2.9)

in the most general circumstance, g may have an explicit dependence on . these equations may be rewritten as the
pair of real equations:

dqi
d

=

g
pi

,

dpi
d

= 

g
qi

,

(2.10)

which are generalized hamiltons equations.

for the case of ordinary classical dynamics, antisymmetric bracket case (for which  = + in eq. (2.7)), the rst
two of the group of three equations which were given above are satised identically for the one-parameter innitesimal
~a of the generating function form which has just been given in eq. (2.8). however, for the symmetric bracket case
(for which  =  in eq. (2.7)), the rst two of that group of three equations impose the following constraint on those
real-valued generating functions g(~a, ~a , ) of continuous one-parameter canonical transformation trajectories:

2g
aiaj

= 0 =

2g
i a
j

a

.

(2.11)

iii. fermion c-number dynamics

for the symmetric bracket case, which we call fermion c-number dynamics, the generating functions of the continuous
one-parameter trajectories of sequential innitesimal canonical transformations are constrained to be constant or linear
in each of ~a and ~a , as well as real-valued. the most general form for the generating function is therefore

g(~a, ~a , ) = g0() +xk

(gk()a

k + g

k()ak) +xl xm

glm()a

l am,

(3.1)

where g0() is real and glm() is a hermitian matrix. upon putting this constrained form for g into the complex
phase space form of the generalized hamiltons equations eq. (2.9), we arrive at

i

dai
d

= gi() +xj

gij ()aj ,

(3.2)

which is a (possibly) inhomogeneous linear equation of matrix schrodinger form. if gi() = 0, the preceding equation
is a general homogeneous type of schrodinger equation, whereas if gi()  (  ), it is a general propagator type
of schrodinger equation. it is clear that the c-number dynamics of the symmetric bracket case must be linear and
describable by a schrodinger type equation.

the generating functions of the continuous one-parameter canonical transformation trajectories are usually consid-
ered to be observables of classical theory when they have no explicit dependence on the parameter. thus we restrict
g(~a, ~a , ) to have no explicit -dependence. in the present case it is always possible to suppress the inhomogeneous
part if the hermitian matrix glm is not singular. this is done by making the canonical transformation

ai  ai = ai +xj (cid:0)g1(cid:1)ij gj.

(3.3)

it is easily veried that these transformed ai also satisfy the c-number symmetric bracket relations. in terms of these
ais, the generalized hamiltons equations become

i

dai
d

= xj

gij aj,

which are of the homogeneous schrodinger matrix equation form, while g itself becomes

g( ~a, ~a) = g0 xl xm (cid:0)g1(cid:1)lm g

l gm +xl xm

glma

l am,

which has no inhomogeneous term.

(3.4)

(3.5)

iv. derivation of the time-dependent schr odinger equation

the result found in eq. (3.4) following from the invariance of the symmetric bracket can now be used to derive
the time-dependent schrodinger equation. choosing the parameter  to be a time parameter t and assuming that
the canonical transformation eq. (3.3) has been made, the dynamical equation eq. (3.4) for a time-independent gij
becomes

i ai(t) = {g(~a, ~a ), ai(t)}+ = xj

gijaj(t).

(4.1)

keeping the last term only in eq. (3.5) and changing ~a  ~a and g( ~a, ~a )  g(~a, ~a ), the real valued generating
function becomes

g(~a, ~a ) = xi xj

a
i (t)gij aj(t).

(4.2)

the hermitian matrix element gij is associated with an hermitian operator g such that

where |ii form a orthonormal complete set of states with identity operator i = pi |iihi|. a general state expanded in

this basis is

gij = hi| g|ji,

|(t)i = xi
with ai(t) = hi|(t)i. from eq. (4.1), follows the relation

ai(t)|ii,



xi

ai(t)|ii= i

|iigijaj(t)

t|(t)i = xi xj
|iihi| g|jiaj(t)
|iihi| g|jihj|(t)i = i g|(t)i

= xi xj
= xi xj

t|(t)i = g|(t)i,

i

(4.3)

(4.4)

which is the time-dependent schrodinger equation when g is identied with the hamiltonian operator h(q, p).

we see here the dierence in the interpretation of the quantities ai(t) in the case of the antisymmetric and symmetric
brackets. in the former these are just the complex coordinates associated with position qi and momentum pi; whereas,
in the latter, they represent the expansion coecients of a general quantum state in terms of an orthonormal basis.
both brackets lead to the completeness relation

this is seen from

hq|{|(t)i,h(t)|}|qi = (q  q).

hq|{ai, a

hq|{|(t)i,h(t)|}|qi
= xi xj
= xi xj

j}|iihj|qi

hq|ij|iihj|qi = hq|i|qi = (q  q).

(4.6)

v. derivation of [q, p] = ih

the principle of symmetric bracket invariance leads to quantum mechanics because it leads to the time-dependent
schrodinger equation and to a derivation of the dirac bracket relation [q, p] = i. firstly, one considers the results of
the invariance of the antisymmetric bracket under a one parameter canonical transformation. the time development
of a real function f (~a, ~a, t) is given by

and the dynamical equations for the coordinates are

f = i{f, h} +

f
t

,

h
a
i

ai= i{ai, h} = i
a
i = i{a

i , h} = i

h
ai

.

(5.1)

(5.2)

these are equivalent to hamiltons equations of classical mechanics.

the invariance of the symmetric bracket under a one parameter canonical transformation gives dynamical equations
for the coordinates(wave function expansion coecients in this case). it is convenient to write eq. (4.1) and its complex
conjugate as

i

~a
t
~a
t

= g  ~a
= ~a  g.

i

these are schrodingers equations for ai and a
i (i can also be a continuous index). the time development of a
real function f (~a, ~a, t) = ~a  f  ~a, which depends on the generator for the one parameter canonical transformation
g(~a, ~a) = ~a  g  ~a, is given by

(5.3)

f = ~a  f  ~a + ~a  f  ~a + ~a 
f = i~a  [ f , g]  ~a +

f
t

,

 f
t  ~a

which follows from eq. (5.3). here f and g are hermitian matrices(operators). for the discrete index case

and

f (~a, ~a, t) = xi xj

h(t)|iihi| f (t)|jihj|(t)i = h(t)| f (t)|(t)i,

f (~a, ~a, t) = z z h(t)|pihp| f (t)|pihp|(t)idpdp,

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

for the continuous index p. the form of g(~a, ~a) shows that classical results are to be associated with expectation
values. when g is identied with the hamiltonian operator h and |ii is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian with
eigenvalues ei, the bilinear form of g(~a, ~a) leads to the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics. this is seen
from

h = ~a  h  ~a = xi

ei|ai|2 = h(t)| h|(t)i,

(5.7)

with

5

h|i = xi

|ai|2 = 1.

the classical dynamics case(antisymmetric bracket result eq. (5.1) for the hamiltonian

h(a, a) =

p2
2m

+ v (q)

(5.8)

gives the result for f (a, a) = q that q = p/m. for the c-number symmetric bracket result eq. (5.4) to give a result
for f that corresponds to classical mechanics, one identies g with the hamiltonian operator h(p, q), and observes
that q = p/m when [q, p] = i. this is found from the expectation value

with |i = |(0)i, u (t) = exp(it h) and the relation

f = h(t)| f (t)|(t)i = h| u (t) f (t) u (t)|i,

d f
dt

= h(t)|i[ h, f ] +


t

f (t)|(t)i,

(5.9)

(5.10)

which corresponds to eq. (5.4) when eq. (4.3) is used. choosing f (t) = q and using the hamiltonian operator found
from eq. (5.8), one nds

dq
dt

= h(t)|i[

p2
2m

, q]|(t)i =

p
m

(5.11)

when [q, p] = i, which of course is equivalent to [a, a] = 1. the appropriate correspondence between force and the
potential function follows from eq. (5.10) when f (t) = p. this gives the result

since the quantum bracket relation between p and q implies

dp
dt

= h(t)|

v (q)

q

|(t)i,

[p, v (q)] = i

v (q)

q

.

(5.12)

(5.13)

this is of course the well known result of ehrenfest [5], and the appropriate states to use in the evaluation of these
expressions when associating them with corresponding classical equations is the minimum uncertainty displacement
states discussed in a sec. vi. these results clearly shows that quantum mechanics is a consequence of the principle
of symmetric bracket invariance, and this is clearly an advance in the understanding of the origin and properties of
quantum theory.

the above proof depends upon the association of the quantum operators with observed quantities through the
prediction of distributions for the spectrum of the operators and expectation values. naturally, the generating
function g(~a, ~a) given in eq. (4.2) leading to the invariance of the symmetric bracket, is of this form. since g can be
identied with the hamiltonian h(q, p), this requires the existence of the expectation values for the operators p and
q. a related derivation of the result [q, p] = i, which depends upon the association of distributions and expectation
values of the selfadjoint operators q and p with the classically observed values, is found in [6], and a similar approach
is found in [7]. the argument of dirac [1] leading to [q, p] = i is incorrect because it depends upon the non-classical
concept of non-commuting quantities in the denition of the classical poisson bracket.

it is easily seen that the argument above for the non-relativistic hamiltonian leading to the quantum bracket
result applies to the relativistic dirac hamiltonian associated with a fermion. furthermore, the importance of the
natural relation between the expectation value of an operator and its observed classical values, which emerges from
the principle of invariance of the symmetric bracket, also resolves the dilemma of dirac where he nds the eigenvalues
of q to be c, [8]. the correct result for a free relativistic dirac particle of mass m, momentum p, and energy e is
(5.14)

= ,

q =

p
e

where, using h = c = 1 and the conventions of [9],

6

p= m
e= m

= 1/p1  2.

this follows from the time derivative of the expectation value

where for a free dirac particle

u(p)= u(p)0

u(p)u(p)= 2m.

u(p)eipx

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)

this removes the need for the notion of zitterbewegung, which is associated with the heisenberg operator but not
with the observed mean value of the operator through the expectation value.

vi. quantum field operators associated with ai and a

i

for each index i, one can associate an operator with the complex numbers ai through the matrix element

as shown in the next section, the operator relations which are consistent with the innitesimal time development
equations for both bracket relations eq. (4.1) and eq. (5.2) involving the complex numbers ai are

ai = hai|ai|aii.

(6.1)

introducing the notation a = ai, we can discuss both the case of boson operators and fermion operators without loss
of generality. in both cases, the states to use in eq. (6.1) are dened as displacement states

{ai, a

j} = ij = [ai, a

j].

(6.2)

in the boson case, the displacement operator is

such that

|ai = d(a)|0i.

d(a) = eaaaa,

(q)= (p) = 1/2,
2(a)= ha| a2|ai  ha| a|ai2

(q)(p) = 1/2

a= ha|a|ai,

a = ha|a|ai.

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

the interpretation of ai in this case is clear. the state |aii is the minimum uncertainty state, and the ais are
the complex numbers that appear in the antisymmetric bracket eq. (2.4) and hamiltons equations, i.e. classical
coordinates.

7

the fermion case can be treated in a similar manner; however, there are some modications in interpretation. the

displacement operator in this case is

d()= eaa,
|ai= d()ei/2|0i = cos(||)ei/2|0i + e+i/2 sin(||)|1i.

 = ||e+i

this give the following:

when

a= ha|a|ai =
a= ha|a|ai =

2

ei

sin 2||
2
sin 2||
ha|aa|ai = cos2 ||

ei

ha|aa|ai= sin2 ||,

ha|aa + aa|ai = 1,

a|0i= a|1i = 0
a|1i= |0i,

a|0i = |1i.

an analogous calculation for (q) and (p) for the fermion case gives

(q)= (1  sin2(2||) cos2())1/2/2
(p)= (1  sin2(2||) sin2())1/2/2
(q)(p)  0.

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

the last inequality in eq. (6.8) does not violate the minimum uncertainty inequality, (q)(p)  1/2, since [q, p] 6= i,
and q and p are not conjugate coordinates.

vii. infinitesimal c-number transformations and their relation to boson and

fermion operators

the innitesimal transformations induced by the c-number symmetric and antisymmetric brackets have analogous
relations involving operators, and these lead naturally to the boson and fermion operator relations eq. (6.2). for the
antisymmetric bracket, the transformation associated with a time dt is

and the appropriate operator equation to associate with this c-number equation is

ai(dt) = ai(0) + idt{h(~a, ~a), ai(0)},

ai(dt) = ai(0) + idt[ h(a, a), ai(0)].

(7.1)

(7.2)

with ai = ai(0), the commutation relation for ai and a
consequence of eq. (5.11), and is the boson commutator

j in this case follows from the relation [q, p] = i, which is a

the associated classical hamiltonian is found from the normal ordered matrix element

[ai, a

j] = ij.

h(~a, ~a) = h~a| : h : |~ai,

(7.3)

(7.4)

with |~ai = |a0i|a1i|ani, where |aii are the minimum uncertainty states dened in eq. (6.4). here normal ordering
is dened as moving the operators a
i to the left according to the boson commutation operation. in this way, the

8

c-number equation eq. (7.1) is a consequence of the expectation value of eq. (7.2), using the displacement states |~ai
found from eq. (6.4).
the innitesimal c-number transformation associated with the symmetric bracket implies both the boson commu-
tation and fermion anticommutation relations. for the c-number symmetric bracket, the innitesimal transformation
is

and the appropriate operator equation to associate with this is

ai(dt) = ai(0)  idt{g(~a, ~a), ai(0)}+,

ai(dt) = ai(0) + idt[g(a, a), ai(0)],

with



g = ~a

 g  ~a,

(7.5)

(7.6)

(7.7)

and ai = ai(0). it is now shown that eq. (7.6) yields the c-number equation eq. (7.5) when the operators satisfy
either the boson commutator or fermion anticommutator relation eq. (6.2). this follows from using

([ai, a

j]ak + a

j[ai, ak])gjk

(ij ak)gjk, boson case

((1  2a

j ai)ak + 2a

jaiak)gjk, f ermion case

[g, ai]= xj xk

and one nds

ai(dt)= xj
h~a|ai(dt)|~ai= xj
ai(dt)= xj

(ij  idtgij)aj

h~a|(ij  idtgij)aj|~ai

(ij  idtgij)aj,

(7.8)

(7.9)

which agrees with eq. (4.1) and eq. (7.5). here the state |~ai is dened as the direct product of displacement states,
|~ai = |a0i|a1i|ani, found from either eq. (6.4) for the boson case or eq. (6.6) for the fermion case.

viii. quantum fields

it is seen from the above that the innitesimal transformations obtained in both the antisymmetric and symmetric
bracket case have corresponding operator equations, if the operators ai and a
j satisfy the boson commutation relations
in the former case and the fermion anticommutation relations in the latter. thus the expansion of quantum elds in
these operators is a natural consequence of the relations found for the associated c-numbers. in both cases the usual
quantum eld expansion [9] is

(~r, t) = xi

(ai(t)i(~r) + b

i (t)

i (~r)),

(8.1)

where b
i (t) = ai(pi0 < 0), with four-momentum time component p0, is an antiparticle creation operator. the
associated c-number elds are found by forming the matrix element with the displacement state |~ai appropriate to
either the boson or the fermion case.

9

the dirac equation, which is of schrodinger type, can of course describe a c-number fermion system, but the klein-
gordon and maxwell equations, although they are linear, are not of schrodinger type. for example, in one spatial
dimension a discretized version of the klein-gordon equation is

this can be replaced by the rst-order equation pair

qi  (1/(2x))2(qi+2  2qi + qi2) + m2qi = 0.

qi = pi,

pi = (1/(2x))2(qi+2  2qi + qi2)  m2qi,

(8.2)

(8.3)

which is a version of hamiltons equations for the particular hamiltonian (time evolution generating function and
observable)

h(~q, ~p) =

1

2 xk (cid:0)p2

k + (1/(2x))2(qk+1  qk1)2 + m2q2
k(cid:1) .

(8.4)

the constraint equations eq.
(2.11) on fermion system c-number generating functions g, which were previously
written in terms of the complex (~a, ~a ) vector phase space variables, translate in terms of the real (~q, ~p) vector phase
space variables into the pair of real-valued constraint equations:

2g
qiqj

=

2g
pipj

,

2g
qipj

2g
qjpi

.

= 

for the discretized klein-gordon hamiltonian given above, we have that

2h

qiqi+2

= (1/(2x))2 6= 0 and

2h

pipi+2

= 0,

(8.5)

(8.6)

which is not in accord with the rst of the preceding pair of c-number fermion system generating function constraint
equations. thus the klein-gordon equation is not of schrodinger type and cannot describe a c-number fermion
system.

we have seen that c-number fermion dynamics is necessarily described by a schrodinger type equation, i.e., is
necessarily already rst quantized, and it has no classical version therefore, its quantization with anticommutators
is inevitably second quantization. on the other hand, the boson commutation relations are consistent with the
results of the antisymmetric c-number bracket equations, and the rst and second quantized theories involving bosons
commutation relations can be directly related to the classical theories through the displacement states eq. (6.4).

ix. time development of ai and ai

from the innitesimal transformations which preserve the brackets, it is possible to obtain the global representations
of the operators which produce the time development of the coordinates ai. for the c-number antisymmetric bracket
case, the time development operator obtained from eq. (7.1) is

ai(t)= u (t)ai = eit(h)ai

(h)ai= {h, ai}
2
(h)ai= {h,{h, ai}}, etc.

ai(0)= ai.

as an example, if h = aa, then one nds a(t) = eita. under time development, one can show that the antisymmetric
bracket is invariant,

(9.1)

{ai(t), a

j (t)} = {ai, a

j} = ij.

the proof is as follows:

(9.2)

in the above, p = n + m, and use has been made of

xm=0

which follows from the jacobi identity

the time development generated by the c-number symmetric bracket can be studied in a similar manner. here the

(h){ai, a

j} = {(h)ai, a

j} + {ai, (h)a

j}.

time development operator obtained from eq. (7.5) for the c-number phase space coordinates is

and g = ~a  g  ~a. since

one nds

ai(t)= v (t)ai = eit+(g)ai

dening the operator g, which must be hermitian since g is real, as done after eq. (4.2), we see that eq. (9.4)
becomes

it is now easy to demonstrate that the invariance of the c-number symmetric bracket results from the unitary

in the case of the quantum boson or fermion operators, the invariance of the commutation relations eq. (6.2)
follows from the unitarity of the time development operator, u (t) = eit h obtained from eq. (7.2) for the boson case
or u(t) = eit g obtained from eq. (9.5) for the fermion case, such that

x. angular momentum

it is interesting to note that the c-number antisymmetric bracket generates the algebra of orbital angular momentum,
and that there is a c-number dierential operator representation of the su (2) lie algebra. the components of orbital
angular momentum are (for i, j, and k = 1, 2 or 3)

with ijk antisymmetric in its indices and 123 = 1. for the classical coordinates ai, the following relations are found:

li = ixi xj

(10.1)

{li, lj}= ixk
{l2, lj}= 0
{li, qj}= ixk

a dierential operator representation for the su (2) algebra is given by

xi. conclusions

(10.4)

in this paper it has been shown that both quantum theory and the quantum eld theory of bosons and fermions
are a natural consequence of the principle of invariance of the symmetric bracket, a concept which is analogous to the
bracket invariance principle that appears in classical dynamics. just as the invariance of the c-number antisymmetric
bracket under a one parameter canonical transformation leads to dynamical equations, which determine the classical
dynamical ow in coordinate phase space, the invariance of the c-number symmetric bracket under a one parameter
canonical transformation leads to a dynamical equation, eq. (7.5), which determines the dynamical ow of quantum
states. in the former case, the dynamical equations are hamiltons equations; however, in the later, the dynamical
equation is a time-dependent schrodinger type equation eq. (3.4), which is equivalent to generalized hamiltons
equations eq. (2.9) or eq. (2.10) for the real part qi and imaginary part pi of the coordinates ai(t) = hi|(t)i.
the truly remarkable consequences of the principle of invariance of the symmetric bracket are the derivation of the
time-dependent schrodinger equation and the quantum bracket relation [q, p] = ih. this argument makes the time-
dependent schrodinger equation a consequence of bracket invariance, and it replaces with a logical derivation the
heuristic conjectures of schrodinger [10], [11], and [12] leading to the discovery of his famous equation. further-
more, it removes [q, p] = ih and the time-dependent schrodinger equation from the status of postulates of quantum
theory. along with these results comes the association naturally of expectation values of quantum operators with
corresponding classical quantities, and the statistical interpretation of quantum theory. in addition, the c-number
time development equation eq. (7.5) found from this principle provides a natural condition for the emergence of the
quantum eld theory of bosons and fermions, when the antisymmetric bracket is associated with the boson operator
commutator and the symmetric bracket is associated with the fermion operator anticommutator. it is clear that both
the rst quantized and second quantized theories of bosons have an associated c-number dynamics; namely, classical
dynamics and classical eld theory. these are found from the expectation values and matrix elements of operators
using boson minimum uncertainty displacement states. however, fermion c-number dynamics is not classical dynam-
ics, but it is already a rst quantized theory, as seen from the derivation in eq. (4.4). the second quantized version is
the quantum eld theory of fermions. the c-number coordinates in this case satisfy the c-number dynamical equation
eq. (7.5), and they are found as matrix elements of fermion operators using the fermion displacement states.

it is clear that the fermion dynamics resulting from the symmetric bracket invariance, allows the gauge couplings
that are known to lead to renormalizable theories for fermion dynamics, i.e. qed, and qcd. the old four-fermion
theory of beta decay, which did not require the intermediation of the w boson, clearly has an equation of motion
which involves fermion phase space variables in a nonlinear fashion, which thus cannot be of the (necessarily linear)
schrodinger equation type that is here required by invariance of the symmetric bracket. this does not mean that
eective theories with nonlinear fermion interactions are not useful approximations. examples of such approximate
theories are the hubbard model [13] and the composite vector boson model [14], where nonlinear interactions may be
introduced using path integral methods with auxiliary elds.
