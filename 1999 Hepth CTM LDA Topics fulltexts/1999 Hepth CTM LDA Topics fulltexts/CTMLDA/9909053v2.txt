abstract

we obtain the general inationary solutions for the slab of ve-dimensional
ads spacetime where the fth dimension is an orbifold s1/z2 and two three-
branes reside at its boundaries, of which the randall-sundrum model corre-
sponds to the static limit. the investigation of the general solutions and their
static limit reveals that the rs model recasts both the cosmological constant
problem and the gauge hierarchy problem into the balancing problem of the
bulk and the brane cosmological constants.

the huge gap between the electroweak scale mw and the planck scale mp, mp/mw 
1016, has been a long standing puzzle in unifying the standard model and the gravity.
recently the extra dimensional models addressing it have drawn much attention [1,2]. in-
troducing the extra dimensions has a long history from kaluza-klein theory to string theory.
what is new is that the ordinary matter is conned to our four-dimensional brane while the
gravity propagates in the whole spacetime. one motivation for such models is the heterotic
m theory, whose eld theory limit is the 11-dimensional supergravity compactied on s1/z2
with supersymmetric yang-mills elds living on two boundaries [3].

the large extra dimension model [1] brings the fundamental gravitational scale around
the weak scale to solve the gauge hierarchy problem and reduce the strength of the 4-
dimensional gravity by having the large extra dimensions, while avoiding conict with ex-
periments by conning the standard model elds to a 3-brane in the extra dimensions. this
model translates the gauge hierarchy to the hierarchy between the fundamental scale and
the size of the extra dimensions.

more recently, randall and sundrum (rs) proposed a ve-dimensional model with non-
factorizable geometry supported by the negative bulk cosmological constant and the oppo-
sitely signed boundary 3-brane cosmological constants. in this model, the gauge hierarchy
problem can be explained by the exponential warp factor even for the small extra dimension.
the model is quite interesting and has drawn much attention because it might be realizable
in supergravity and superstring compactications [36]. however, its geometry is based on
the very specic relation between the bulk and the brane cosmological constants. then the
question arises how precisely this relation should hold to preserve the necessary geometry. in
this letter, we try to answer this question by nding the cosmological inationary solutions
with general sets of the bulk and the brane cosmological constants and comparing them with
the static solution given by rs. the cosmological aspect of the extra dimensional models has
been discussed by many authors [79]. especially the inationary solutions were obtained
for the at bulk geometry [10], and for the ads bulk geometry [11,12], where the condition is
imposed among parameters such that the extra dimension does not inate. here we obtain
the general inationary solutions for the ads bulk geometry and focus on the connection to
the gauge hierarchy problem.

we consider the ve-dimensional spacetime with coordinates (, xi, y) where  and xi, i =
1, 2, 3 denote the usual four-dimensional spacetime and y is coordinate of the fth dimension,
which is an orbifold s1/z2 where the z2 action identies y and y. we choose the range of
y to be from 1/2 to 1/2. we consider two 3-branes extending in the usual 4-dimensional
spacetime reside at two orbifold xed points y = 0 and y = 1/2, so that they form the
boundaries of the ve-dimensional spacetime. this ve-dimensional model is described by
the action

s = zm

(1)

where m is the fundamental gravitational scale of the model, b and i are the bulk and the
brane cosmological constants, li are the lagrangians for the elds conned in the branes.
since we are interested in the cosmological solution, we assume that the three-dimensional
spatial section is homogeneous and isotropic. further we consider it is at for simplicity.
the most general metric satisfying this can be written as

ds2 = n2(, y)d 2 + a2(, y)ijdxidxj + b2(, y)dy2

for the above action and metric, we obtain the following einstein equations corresponding
to (00), (ii), (55), (05) components respectively:

dy to (3) and (4), we obtain the boundary conditions

where the dot and the prime represent the derivatives with respect to  and y, respectively.
the equations with bulk and boundary sources are equivalent to the equations with bulk
sources and proper boundary conditions. to give non-singular geometry, n, a and b must be

the equations (3)(6) and the boundary conditions (7) constitute a starting point of
cosmology of the ve-dimensional model considered in this paper. its dicult to solve the
whole bulk equations with generic sources, but at the brane boundaries, the (55) and (05)
equations give the friedman-like equation

in this paper, we consider the cosmological constant dominated cases, and neglect the
matter and radiation energy densities of the branes. then the above equations allow a
static solution, the so-called rs solution [2], when the bulk cosmological constant is negative
(b < 0) and related to the brane cosmological constants by

where k = (b/6m 3)1/2 and ki = i/6m 3. we take the brane with the positive cosmolog-
ical constant to be at y = 0. the metric of the static solution is given by

k = k1 = k2,

(9)

ds2 = e2kb0|y|dxdx + b2

0dy2,

(10)

where b0 is a constant which determines the length of the extra dimension. in this model,
the 4-dimensional planck scale is given by

p =

[1  ekb0],

(11)

 1 it is k rather than 1

and for 1
2b0 that determines it. rs [2] argued that, due
to the warp factor ekb0y which has dierent values at the hidden brane (y = 0) and at
the visible brane (y = 1
2), any mass parameter m0 on the visible brane corresponds to a
physical mass m = m0e 1
2 kb0 and the moderate value 1
2kb0  37 can produce the huge ratio
mp /mw  1016. thus the gauge hierarchy problem is converted to the problem related
to geometry, xing the size of the extra dimension. then it is an important question how
precise the relation (9) must be in order for the rs solution to work since the exact relation
is assumed a priori to get (10).

now we try to answer this question by solving the einstein equations with the bulk
and the brane cosmological constants, but without the ne tuned condition (9). boundary
condition (7) suggests n = a, and we rst try a separable function n = a = g( )f (y). then
the (05) equation yields b = b(y). after separate coordinate transformations of  and y, we
come to an ansatz

n = f (y),

a = g( )f (y),

b = b0,

(12)

where b0 is a constant. now subtracting the (ii) equation by the (00) equation, we obtain
( g/g) = 0. so we dene ( g/g)  h0 = constant. then the (55) equation gives

b0!2
  f 

= h 2

0 + k2f 2,

(13)

and the (00) and (ii) equations just give a redundant equation. for b < 0, the solution to
this equation consistent with the orbifold symmetry is

f =

h0
k

sinh(kb0|y| + c0).

(14)

the boundary condition (7) imposes

4

k1 = k coth(c0), k2 = k coth(

1
2

kb0 + c0).

(15)

therefore, the solution is allowed when k1, k2 and k satisfy k < k1 < k2 and they are
related to the length of the extra dimension l5 = 1

2b0 by

l5 =

1
2

b0 =

1
2k

ln"k2  k
k1  k 

k1 + k

k2 + k# .

the metric of this solution is

2

ds2 = (cid:18)h0
k (cid:19)

sinh2(kb0|y| + c0)hd 2 + e2h0 ijdxidxji + b2

0dy2.

(16)

(17)

we arrive at the static limit by taking h0  0 and c0   while keeping the ratio h0
2k ec0  1
xed, and the metric (17) becomes (10). for h0 6= 0, h0 is not a physical quantity and can
be set to k which corresponds to the shift of the initial value of  . then by the coordinate
transformation dy = dy/ sinh(kb0|y| + c0), the metric becomes [11]

ds2 = d 2 + e2k ijdxidxj + b2

0dy2

sinh2(kb0|y| + c0)

.

(18)

the metric (17) describes ination of the spatial dimensions with the length of extra
dimension xed. at a given y, we can perform a 4-dimensional coordinate transformation
to make the 4-dimensional metric be in the form ds2
(4) = dt2 + e2h(y)tijdxidxj. then we
get the hubble parameter

especially, at each boundary, we have

h(y) = k csch(kb0|y| + c0).

h(0) = qk2

1  k2, h(

1
2

) = qk2

2  k2,

(19)

(20)

respectively. we see that ination occurs when the bulk and the brane cosmological constants
deviate from the relation (9), which can be easily seen from the boundary equation (8). the
condition (16) means that to keep the length of the extra dimension xed while the spatial
dimensions inate, we must ne tune the bulk and the brane cosmological constants, in
other words, we must put two branes a distance l5 apart for given k1, k2 and k.

for the more general case that the distance between two branes is larger or smaller than

l5, the solution can be obtained with the non-separable function

n(, y) = a(, y) =

1

 f (y) + g0

,

b(, y) = kb0 a(, y),

where b0 and g0 are constants. the metric for this general case can be found to be

ds2 = d 2 + ijdxidxj + (kb0 )2dy2
[k sinh(kb0|y| + c0) + g0]2

,

5

(21)

(22)

where b0 and c0 are given by

c0 = cosh1  k1
k ! ,
kb0 = 2"cosh1 k2

k !  cosh1  k1

k !# .

(23)

when g0 = 0, this metric becomes (18) by the coordinate transformation 1
 d = k d .
when g0 > 0 (g0 < 0), the distance between two branes is smaller (larger) than l5 and the
above metric describes that two branes come close and nally meet (move away from each
other) while the spatial dimensions are inating. the boundary condition is not aected by
the presence of g0, and h(0) and h( 1

2) are the same as (20), as seen in (8).

for the special case k1 = k2 > k, l5 becomes 0 and the above solutions cannot cover.
instead, we can nd a solution with a dierent ansatz n(, y) = a(, y) = b(, y). the metric
is given by

ds2 = d 2 + ijdxidxj + dy2
1  k2)1/2 + ky + c0]2 ,

[(k2

(24)

where c0 is a constant. this metric describes ination in both the spatial dimensions and
the extra dimension.

let us consider the connection between the inationary solutions and the rs static
solution. the static limit that both k1 and k2 approach k in the inationary solutions
corresponds to the rs solution. suppose that the ve-dimensional universe underwent
ination in the early epoch and nally settles down to the static rs model. then the
relation (9) does not hold exactly but approximately now. this situation is most likely
described by the static limit of the inationary solutions. then, the current observations on
the hubble constant restrict the visible brane hubble parameter h( 1

2):

h(

1
2

) = qk2

2  k2 <

 1060mp

(25)

where k = o(m) = o(mp) is assumed. therefore, the bulk and the visible brane cosmolog-
ical constants must cancel each other up to very high precision. this is a ve-dimensional
version of the well-known cosmological constant problem [12] and the rs condition (9) is
nothing but the condition for the vanishing 4-dimensional eective cosmological constant at
both branes. we do not attempt to solve this notorious problem in this paper. instead, we
concentrate on the gauge hierarchy problem within this context.

the key point of the rs solution to the gauge hierarchy problem is the size of the extra
dimension appearing in the exponential warp factor. if the rs condition (9) exactly holds, it
is not determined in this framework and remains as a at direction in the moduli space. for
the bulk and the brane cosmological constants that do not satisfy the rs condition, there is
a critical value l5, for which the extra dimension size remains constant. our general solution
shows that this is an unstable stationary conguration. a slight deviation will make the extra
dimension size shrink or grow. this is a generic consequence of gravity theory, and there is
a way to overcome it by including extra dynamics beyond simple gravity for the modulus b.

6

this is a ve-dimensional version of the modulus stabilization problem. toward the solution
of this problem, an attempt using the bulk scalar eld was made recently in [13] and an
earlier attempt within the compactied heterotic m theory without the bulk cosmological
constant was done in [14] using the membrane instanton eects and the racetrack mechanism.
we will not discuss it which is beyond the scope of this paper.

with this in mind, let us look at the rs solution for the gauge hierarchy problem. in
the static limit k1,k2  k of the inationary solutions with the xed extra dimension
size, we can see from (16) that the extra dimension size dose not have a unique value but
varies depending on how k1 and k2 approach k. this is just what is said by the modulus
stabilization problem. near the static limit, the length of the extra dimension is expressed
in terms of the hubble parameters of two branes by

klrs =

1
2

kbrs  ln

h( 1
2)
h(0)

.

(26)

2) is very small, to keep 1

since h( 1
2kbrs of order 1, we also have to adjust the bulk and the
hidden brane cosmological constants to the same accuracy as we did for the bulk and visible
brane cosmological constants. the rs solution for the gauge hierarchy problem demands
1
2kbrs  37, and this number seems quite moderate at rst sight. however, in fact, it
requires further ne tune of the hidden brane hubble parameter than the visible one:

h(0) = qk2

1  k2  1016h(

1
2

) <
 1076mp.

(27)

thus, to solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the context of the rs model, the balance
between the bulk and the hidden brane cosmological constants should take place with 1016
times more accuracy than that between the bulk and the visible cosmological constants. at
any rate, the rs model again converts the gauge hierarchy to the ne tuning of the bulk
and the brane cosmological constants. it will be interesting to look at the problem in terms
of four dimensional eective theory and see whether there is a nice stabilization mechanism
by which the above argument can be avoided using additional interactions of the b modulus
other than the gravity.

in summary, we found the general inationary solutions for the slab of 5-dimensional ads
spacetime with two boundary 3-branes and viewed the rs model as the static limit of those
solutions. then both the cosmological constant problem and the gauge hierarchy problem
are recast into the ne tuning problem of the bulk and the brane cosmological constants.
the cosmological constant problem appear as the ne tuning between the bulk and the
visible brane cosmological constants, and the gauge hierarchy problem as the more severe
ne tuning between the bulk and the hidden brane cosmological constants. the inclusion
of matter at the brane boundaries might alter the above conclusion, but we expect it does
not much. the real solution of those problems surely requires additional ingredients to the
5-dimensional model considered in this paper, but the implications of this simple model is
so interesting that it deserves further study. the magic bullet for the cosmological constant
problem and the gauge hierarchy problem may be found in the correlation mechanism of
the bulk and brane cosmological constants, which reminds us of the recent development in
string theory, the holography. we also leave the modulus stabilization problem which is
connected to the problem addressed in this letter for future work.
