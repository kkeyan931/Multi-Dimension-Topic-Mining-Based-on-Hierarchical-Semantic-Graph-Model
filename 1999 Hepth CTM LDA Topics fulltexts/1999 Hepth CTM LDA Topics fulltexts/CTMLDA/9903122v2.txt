abstract

we develop two n = 2 supereld formulations of free equations of motion for
the joint model of all d = 4 massless higher-superspin elds in generating
form. the explicit osp(2|4) supersymmetry is achieved without exploiting the
harmonic superspace, and with adding no auxiliary component elds to those
of n = 1 superelds. the formulations are developed in two dierent osp(2|4)
homogeneous superspaces which have a structure of a bre bundle over the
standard d = 4 ads superspace, with dimensions (7|4) and (7|8). the n = 2
covariant derivatives in these spaces are expressed in terms of n = 1 ones which
gives simple rules for component analysis.

0 introduction.

not long ago, a universal formulation for the linearized dynamics of innite system
of higher spin massless elds on anti-de sitter space has been suggested [1], where
the gauge-invariant action is formulated in terms of two real and one complex uncon-
strained superelds on m 7|4 = superads4  h3, where superads4 is n = 1 anti-de
sitter space and h3 is r3,1 one-sheeted hyperboloid. the possibility to develop such
a formulation arose due to special properties of n = 1 ads superelds along with the
special choice of the spin spectrum including every n = 1 superspin with multiplicity
one. this spectrum structure coincides with that of the vasilievs higher-spin interac-
tion theory for d = 4 massless higher spin elds [2], a signicant breakthrough in the
higher spin interaction problem. it is not known up to now, whether the equations
of [2] are lagrangian or not.

the latter circumstance has urged some authors to try developing alternative
approaches. in particular, many eorts were applied to construct dierent generating
formulations, usually using auxiliary operators of creation and annihilation [3]. in
this respect the formulation of [1] is distinguished as it is based on the commutative
algebra and gives, in a sense, a theory, formulated in extended supermanifold. this
property seems to be more suitable for describing nonlinear structures.

another advantage of the approach undertaken in [1, 4, 5] is the manifest osp(1|4)
covariance. although the equations of motion of [2] have clear gauge structure, the
question of global symmetry of higher-spin elds has never been suciently studied.
the hypothetical symmetry of the actions [6] under the fradkin-vasiliev superalge-
bra of higher spins [7] has never been observed even on the free level. moreover, it is
known that, in the macdowell-mansouri approach used in [6], even the usual global
supersymmetry transformations of supergravity are very subtle. contrary, in the gen-
erating supereld approach the algebra of transformations of n = 2 supersymmetry
closes o-shell [1, 8] and (as we prove here) without the breaking terms proportional
to gauge transformations. therefore, it is natural to set the question of a manifestly
n = 2-covariant form of gks action.

an additional motivation to develop such a formulation comes from the study of
n = 2 supereld theories for poincare super yang-mills and gravity in harmonic su-
perspace [9, 10], which present themselves a new type of supergeometries which have
no analogues in n = 1 case. here it is worth noting that in harmonic superspace
innitely many auxiliary or purely gauge component elds were introduced to achieve
an explicit n = 2 covariance. the model considered in the present paper also con-
tains innitely many component elds, because it describes all massless superspins.
nevertheless, for every superspin, the number of components is nite. moreover,
the formulation with explicit n = 2 supersymmetry has neither auxiliary nor purely
gauge components in addition to those of n = 1 supereld version. besides, to our
knowledge, the n = 2 supereld models in ads superspace have not been considered
before. the n = 2 ads supergeometry diers essentially from the at one because
osp(2|4) algebra does not possess the internal su(2) subalgebra (rotating supersym-

2

metry generators) crucial for the idea of harmonic superspace. then, the known
supereld formulations of n = 2 supergravity contain nonminimal formulation of
n = 1 supergravity (see also the case of superspin 3/2 in [8]). but the description
of ads superspace in the nonminimal formulation is unknown (see e.g.
[11]). this
can cause problems in a description of n = 2 ads supergeometry in the framework
of the conventional approach.

on may expect that the manifest n = 2 supersymmetry property may help to
uncover the geometry of higher-spin gauge symmetries which is crucial for the non-
linear action construction. that is why the supereld formulation developed in the
present paper may be taken as a starting point to analyze the interaction problem
and to construct a consistent nonlinear action.

in this paper, we construct a manifestly n = 2 covariant formulation for the
equations of motion of gks theory [1]. we construct the n = 2 superspaces m 7|4 =
osp(2|4)/h (where h is the subgroup of osp(2|4) corresponding to the subalgebra
su(2, 0|1, 0)  osp(2|4)) and m 7|8 = osp(2|4)/su(2) u(1) (diering by the number
of odd coordinates) and present two equivalent forms of gks equations written in
terms of superelds on these superspaces.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 1, we describe the n = 2 ads su-
peralgebra osp(2|4) and its subalgebras su(2, 0|1, 0) and su(2) u(1) and exhibit the
decomposition of osp(2|4) w.r.t. these subalgebras. in section 2, we recall the gks
theory and reformulate it by a twist which makes the n = 2 transformations being
realized by local vector elds on m 7|4, we also observe that the n = 2 transformation
laws may be improved by new terms, proportional to the equations of motion, what
provides the elds transformations with a more transparent form. remarkably, it
appears that such transformations preserve just the gks equations of motion and
not the action. but it is this form of n = 2 transformations which is derived from
the manifestly n = 2-covariant formalism introduced in the subsequent sections. in
section 3, the covariant derivatives on homogeneous spaces m 7|4 = osp(1|4)/su(2),
m 7|4 = osp(2|4)/h and m 7|8 = osp(2|4)/su(2)  u(1) are constructed in terms
of covariant derivatives on n = 1 ads superspace superads4 = osp(1|4)/so(3, 1)
and the so called small vielbein eld. it gives a possibility to study various n = 2
superelds and equations. in section 4, the special strongly chiral constrained su-
perelds on m 7|8 are studied and their component content is exhibited in terms of
n = 1 m 7|4 superelds.
in section 5, the gks equations are equivalently refor-
mulated in terms of two strongly chiral elds on m 7|8. this gives the anticipated
manifestly n = 2 covariant formulation for the gks equations of motion. in section
6, we show that all the stu may be reformulated once again in terms of superelds
on m 7|4. the obtained equations of motion describe dynamics of superelds with
indices, transforming under a local supergroup. in conclusion, we discuss the results.
we supply our paper with a few appendices carrying the information of technical
character to be referred in the main text. appendix a contains general facts about
covariant derivatives on homogeneous spaces. the short appendix b introduces our
supertensor notation. appendix c describes the a(1|0) superalgebra and a brief study

3

of its nite-dimensional representations properties.

let us describe our main notation. the letters , , . . . ,  . . . describe sl(2, c)
spinor undotted and dotted indices. the letters a, b, c, . . . describe su(2) spinor indices
or so(3, 1) vector ones, depending on a situation. the letters , , . . . , ,  . . . describe
the indices of two conjugated a(1|0) (1|2) dimensional representations.
we consider only lorentz tensors symmetric in their undotted indices and sepa-
rately in dotted ones. a tensor of type (k, l) with k undotted and l dotted indices
can be equivalently represented as (k, l)  (k) (l)  1...k 1... l = (1k)( 1 l).
the indices, which are denoted by one and the same letter, should be symmetrized
separately with respect to upper and lower indices; after the symmetrization, the
maximal possible number of the upper and lower indices denoted by the same letter
in particular (k)(l)  (1k k+1k+l) and (k) 
are to be contracted.
(1k1). the similar notation, with a proper account of grading, takes place
in the case of supertensors, see appendix b. the two-dimensional antisymmetric 
tensors are dened such that 12 = 12 = 1.
the notation (p|q) stands for the dimension of a superspace with p even and q
odd coordinates. [a, b] = ab  ()(a)(b)ba stands for graded commutator while
[a, b] = ab  ba is an ordinary commutator.
1 n = 2 ads superalgebra osp(2|4) and its subalge-

bras.

in this section, we provide the information about the structure of osp(2|4) superal-
gebra and its decompositions with respect to some subalgebras, this information is
being used extensively below.

tation relations

the n = 2 ads superalgebra osp(2|4) is dened via the following graded commu-

[ab, ] = 0,

here a, b, . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4 are so(3, 2) spinor representation indices; i, j, . . . = 1, 2
are so(2) vector ones; kronecker delta-symbol ij = ij and antisymmetric tensor
ij = ij are two-dimensional so(2)-invariant tensors. the matrix cab, cab =
cba, c 2 = 1 is so(3, 2) charge conjugation matrix, its explicit form is exhibited
below (eq.(1.11-1.9)). the so(3, 2) generators ab are symmetric in spinor indices,
ab = ba. the generators ab and  are even while di

a are odd.

we are interested in the decomposition of osp(2|4) with respect to the maximal
compact subalgebra of its even part su(2)  so(2)  so(2), where su(2)  so(2) is the

4

maximal compact subalgebra of so(3, 2) and one more so(2) is associated to the 
generator. the decomposition is performed quite simply by employing the fact that
the spinor representation of so(3, 2) is decomposed into the direct sum d( 1
2)
w.r.t. su(2)  so(2) subalgebra, the +,  subscripts denote the so(2) weights.
therefore, the spinor generators di
a are classied by their su(2)  so(2) indices and
by additional so(2) weight associated to the  generator:

2)+d( 1

a = {d+

where the upper index labels the -weight:

(1.6)

(1.7)

and the lower indices correspond to su(2)so(2) representation, a, b, . . . are the su(2)
spinor indices.
according to (1.1), the above classication induces the decomposition of the even

generators into subsets

++(ab) = [d+

to establish the presice form of the rest osp(2|4) commutation relations in this basis
we need to know how the matrices cab, ij, ij look like. the answer is

c+a +b = ca b = 0

the other commutators vanish. the su(2)  so(2)  so(2) subalgebra is spanned by
generators sab (sab = sba), s, , where sab are su(2) generators and s,  are so(2)
ones.

in what follows, we use the usual complex conjugation notations adopted in super-
symmetry literature (see e.g. [12]): complex conjugation does not transpose operators
but gives the additional minus sign for a product of odd operators:

(didj ) = ()ij d

id
j .

in this notation, the complex conjugation rules consistent with commutation relations
(1.8-1.20) look like

s
a(2) = sa(2) , s = s ,  = ,

a(2) = a(2)

(da


 ) = d

(1.21)

(1.22)

(da

+ ) = d
a,

(1.23)
this complex conjugation extracts osp(2|4) superalgebra from its complexication.
now it is seen that the complexication of superalgebra osp(2|4) contains two
a(1|0) subalgebras (see appendix c , eq. (c.1)) spanned by

+a.

sab , t =

which intersect over sab generators.

sab , t =  +

s , d+a = d+

a , da = d

+a,

(1.24)

(1.25)

these subalgebras are invariant w.r.t. conjugation (1.211.23) that extracts their
su(2, 0|1, 0) real forms with the even part being isomorphic to su(2)so(2). also, they
are connected to each other by osp(2|4) automorphism  = , 
a =
d

a, therefore we can choose one of them without an information loss.
lets choose the subalgebra (1.24) and study the decomposition of osp(2|4) adjoint
representation w.r.t. it. one nds a direct sum of graded subspaces: the rst one is
su(2, 0|1, 0) itself

ab = ab, d

the second and the third ones are mutually conjugated subpaces

h =n(ab) , d+

eventually, the forth selfconjugated subspace is (1|0) dimensional:

h =(cid:26)d

(  s)(cid:27) .

(1.27)

(1.28)

in appendix c, the nite-dimensional representations (fdrs) of su(2, 0|1, 0) are studied
to some depth and two conjugated (1|2)-dimensional minimal representations 
and   are introduced (eqs. (c.2-c.4)). their tensor products are useful for the
description of various fdrs. in particular, the subspaces h0, h, h, h transform under
su(2, 0|1, 0) according to

da

(1.29)

h0 = e =   sab  abt d+a
h = d =   ab d+
h = d =   ++ab d

and for h one has the trivial representation.
the whole superalgebra osp(2|4) may be rewritten in su(2, 0|1, 0) covariant form

2 dierent forms of generating theory

let us recollect the supereld formulations of free dynamics of higher spin elds in
n = 1 ads superspace [5, 1]. we denote 4 + 4 coordinates in ads superspace by z
so that (z) is a supereld in this superspace. all the necessary information about
ads superspace is contained in the superalgebra of covariant derivatives da:

1here * means usual complex conjugation in grassman algebra.

da = {d , d, d   (d)}1,

(2.1)

7

exhibited by the expressions2
[d, d ] = 2id ,
[d,d] = 4m,

[d ,d ] = 2( m   +   m),
[d,d ] = i d 

(2.2)

and their complex conjugated counterparts. here m(2) and m (2) are local lorentz
rotations, e.g. m(2) = . more information about the geometry of ads
superspace can be found in [11, 14]. here we need only the fact that this supermanifold
is the coset space osp(1|4)/so(3, 1). the action of the osp(1|4) algebra in ads
superspace can be expressed in terms of covariant derivatives (see eq.(2.26) below).
in [4, 5], there were found two formulations for each superspin: the transversal
and the longitudinal ones. we will use here only the transversal formulation for half-
integer superspin s + 1/2 and the longitudinal one for integer superspin s, denoting
them as s
s . it is this choice that is necessary for constructing n = 2
supersymmetry transformations [8] and generating formulation [1]. the actions s
and sk

s are expressed in terms of the following dynamical superelds:

s+1/2 and sk

s+1/2

s+1/2 = { h(s, s), (s  1, s  1), (s  1, s  1)},
v 
s = { h (s  1, s  1), g(s, s), g(s, s)},
v k

s  1
s  1

(2.3)

(2.4)

where h and h  are arbitrary real superelds while  and g are constrained complex
superelds, satisfying the following relations

d (s1) (s1) = 0,  ( d2  2(s + 1))(s  1, s  1) = 0,

d g(s) (s) = 0,  ( d2 + 2s)g(s, s) = 0

(2.5)

(2.6)

and called transversal linear and longitudinal linear superelds, respectively. these
two types of superelds exhaust all possible o-shell constrained superelds with
given index structure in ads superspace. the gauge parameters are superelds of
the same kind as the dynamical elds: the action s
s+1/2 is gauge invariant w.r.t.
transformations with longitudinal linear parameter g(s, s) and the action sk
s is gauge
invariant w.r.t. the ones with transversal linear parameter (s  1, s  1).
subjected to one-sheeted hyperboloid:

to construct the generating formulation let us consider an so(3, 1) four-vector,

qaqa = 1,

q q  = 2.

in [1], it is proposed to consider spin-tensors (2.3,2.4) as the coecients arising in
expansion of analytic functions in power series via the q-vector:

(q) =



xs=0

(s) (s)q(s) (s),

q(s) (s) = q  . . . q 

.

(2.7)

(2.10)

the gauge parameters are described by the function

(z, q) =



xs=0

(s) (s)q(s) (s),

(s, s) = (s, s)  g(s, s).

(2.12)

the functions (2.92.12) depend both on the vector q and on the coordinates of ads
superspace z, we will call them superelds. note that the dependence of u, y , x
and  on their arguments is arbitrary (except for analyticity in q and reality of y
and x) though superelds g, , g and  are linear (2.5,2.6). this is due to the fact
that, in ads superspace, the sum of transversal and longitudinal linear spin-tensor
superelds gives an arbitrary supereld [1, 14].

to derive an action for these superelds, the lorentz-invariant trace is introduced

in [1] to the algebra of analytic functions of vector q:
(1)s
s + 1

tr  = (0, 0) = tr (  ) =



xs=0

(s) (s)(s) (s),

(2.13)

it is also convenient to use the following scalar operators:

q = q d d ,
1
2dd,

=

p = d2

2

q = q  d d = q,
p =

= p .

d2
2

(2.14)

(2.15)

these operators, quadratic in derivatives, satisfy the following relations due to (2.2)3

q p = (p  1)q

3in this section, the local so(3, 1) rotations m(2) and m(2) from connection terms of covariant

derivatives da do not act on the indices of vector q .

9

qp = (p + p  2) q + (p + 1)q

(2.16)

it was noted in [1] that the real supereld y is purely gauge and the gauge y = 0 can
be imposed and substituted into the action. then the joint action of superelds of
all superspins (including nongauge massless elds of low spins 0, 1/2) takes a simple
form:

x(qu+ qu )

u (p+ p2)u

2

u pu o,

s =

1
2

trz d8z e1nx 2+

1
2

(2.17)
where d8z e1 is ads superinvariant measure. the action is invariant with respect
to the following gauge transformations with real gauge parameter (z, q):

x = i( p  p),

u = i q,

u  = iq,

(2.18)

this gauge invariance can be checked straightforwardly with the use of eq.(2.16).
it is remarkable that the corresponding calculation for a separate superspin [5] is
much more complicated. n = 2 supersymmetry transformations of ref.[8] can also
be brought to generating form. for this purpose one should express them via the
killing scalar parameter t(z) [1]:

t = t,

(d2  4)t = 0,

d d t = 0,

(2.19)

containing one spinor and one scalar constants which are exactly the parameters of
transformations necessary to complete the manifestly realized n = 1 ads superalge-
bra to the n = 2 one:

tu =

tx = 2i[ p, t]ru + c.c.,

ty = 0,
i
[p + p, t]rx +
2
+iq (dt) d r(u + u ).

i
2

( p  1)[p + p, t]ry +

(2.20)

here the new operation arises which inverts the odd powers of q , r(q) = (q).
since the variation ty vanishes, the other variations tx and tu do not change in
the gauge y = 0.

s+1/2 and sk

note that the actions s

s for higher spin superelds contain the factor
(1)s to supply a positive hamiltonian [5].
in generating formulation (2.17), this
sign alternation arises due to relation q q  = 2 what provides (1)s in (2.13).
here we observe that there is another possible generating formulation in which su-
perelds (2.3,2.4) emerge in decomposition of functions on two-sheeted hyperboloid,
parametrized by a four-vector r , that can be chosen to be proportional to q:

r r  = 2,

rara = 1,

q = ir.

(2.21)

we will see that, in this formulation, the operation r passes from the global symmetry
it is
transformations (2.20) to the action and the sign alternation still remains.

10

convenient here to dene the new operation of complex conjugation  which acts in
just the same way on the superelds not depending on q and r as the operation 
used before, while their actions on q and r are opposite:

q = q,
q = q,

r = r,
r = r.

(2.22)

the fact that  and  act in one and the same way on q-independent superelds means
that if an action functional is real with respect to  then it is real with respect to 
either.
the main goal of our reformulation q  r is to choose a more adequate manifold
from the global symmetry point of view. we will see that, in this new formulation,
osp(2|4) transformations are realized by local operators without r operation. more-
over, the new supermanifold parametrized by (z, r) is the homogeneous superspace
m 7|4 = osp(2|4)/h where the supergroup h is dened in the introduction and in
subsect 3.2. the osp(1|4)-covariant form of vector superelds that give the action of
osp(2|4) superalgebra can be constructed with the use of killing vector:

k (z) = k ,

dk  = 0,

d d k  = 0,

(2.23)

and killing scalar t (2.19). it is convenient to introduce the following notation for all
linearly independent derivatives of these killing superelds:

i
8

d k ,
k =
k(2) = dk,
1
2dt,

t =

k  = (k),
k (2) = (k(2)),

t  = (t).

(2.24)

(2.25)

then the vector supereld giving the action of osp(1|4) superalgebra can be written
as usual (see e. g. [11]),

k = 

1
2

k d  + kd + k  d  + k(2)m(2) + k (2) m (2) = k = k.

(2.26)

it appears that the rest vectors of osp(2|4) are parametrized by killing scalar t,

m = 2ir (t d  + t d) + 2it, m = m = m,

(2.27)

where  is an imaginary vector eld
i

 = 

(q  q) =

(2.28)

it can be straightforwardly checked that a commutator of two operators m closes on
k,
(2.29)

k  = 16i(tt

 + t t

).

[m(t),m(t)] = k(k),

11

the conclusion that the coordinates (z, r) parametrize superspace osp(2|4)/h will
be proved by the construction of osp(2|4)-covariant derivatives with the proper al-
gebra (see sec. 3). thus, vector superelds m and k give the action of osp(2|4)
superalgebra.
depending on r are new superelds z = z  and v whose contents coincide with

the contents of x and u, respectively.

z(z, r) =

v (z, r) =

r(s) (s)z(s) (s),

r(s) (s)v(s) (s),





xs=0

z(s, s) = (1)[ s
v (s, s) = (1)[ s1

2 ]x(s, s),

2 ]u(s, s),

(2.30)

(2.31)

where [] denotes the integral part of . note that, even though q is connected to
r by (2.21), and superelds z, v and x, u have the identical content, they are not
proportional. therefore, the new formulation cannot be obtained by a trivial change
like x  z, u  v , q  ir in the action (2.17). nevertheless, it is not dicult
to check that every term in the action (2.17) can be equivalently rewritten in new
formulation with the use of operation r:

v prv

zr(qv + qv )
v prv o,
where tr is the same operation as in (2.13): tr(r) = tr(iq)  (0, 0), q and
q = q are the same operators (2.14) with ir being substituted for q.
let us turn to n = 2 supersymmetry transformations. it is shown in ref.[8] that
their algebra closes o-shell. nevertheless, this algebra is broken by the terms propor-
tional to gauge transformations (see [1] for the generating form of this algebra). here
we observe that it can be closed eventually by adding certain gauge transformation
to (2.20). the structure of the global symmetry becomes more clear after splitting
v into its real and imaginary parts (with respect to ) v =  + i. then the action
(2.32) reads

(2.32)

s =

trz d8z e1n  zrz  2izr + r+
zr(q + q) + ir(p  p)  (p + p  1)ro.

(2.33)

gauge transformations (2.18) convert into

z = i(p  p),

 = 

i
2

(q + q),

 = 2i,

(2.34)

from (2.33,2.34) it is seen that z and  are similar elds because they are both
auxiliary (either z or , not both, can be excluded by the equations of motion), and

12

enter the action in an analogous way. one can show that the supereld  is purely
gauge. really, using (2.21) and (2.8) one can derive gauge transformations for the
components (s, s) of the supereld :

(s) (s) = asd (s1) (s1) + bsd (s+1) (s+1)

where bs 6= 0 and as are numerical factors. using the freedom in the choice of
(s+1) (s+1) we can put (s) (s) = 0. this gauge imposes the dierential restriction
 = 0 on the parameter and therefore cannot be inserted in action.
to obtain the n = 2 supersymmetry transformations with completely closed
algebra one should add to transformations (2.20) the gauge variation (2.34) with the
parameter  = 2t, rewritten in terms of superelds z,  and . the result is

t = m,
tz = n + it(p  p),
t = nz +
t(q + q),
n = [p + p, t] = n + 4t,

i
2

(2.35)

n = 2(td + t  d )

here m is a vector supereld of osp(2|4) superalgebra (2.27) and n is another vector
supereld whose commutator has the opposite, as compared to (2.29), sign.

[n (t),n (t)] =

1
k = [n(t), n(t)].

(2.36)

note that n-dependent terms in (2.35) may be represented with the use of matrix j:

  z
 ! = jn  z

 ! + . . . ,

j =   0 1

0 ! ,



j 2 = ,

(2.37)

and the dots denote -dependent terms. this provides the correct sign in the com-
mutator:

[t, 

(2.38)
where k is the killing operator (2.26) with vector parameter k  dened in (2.29).
the dierence in sign with [1] is conditioned by a dierent denition of commutator
of variations [t, 
t].

t] = k,

let us emphasize that the supereld  transforms via itself by the supervector
operator m. the whole representation of the superalgebra osp(2|4) on superelds
, z and  has a semidirect sum structure. surprisingly, it is possible to split it
completely by adding variations proportional to the equations of motion. let us
write them down

s/z  2rz  2ir +
s/  2r  2irz + ir(p  p) = 0,
s/ 

i
2r(q + q)z + ir(p  p)  2(p + p  1)r = 0.

i
2r(q + q) = 0,

(2.39)

(2.40)

(2.41)

13

then we can dene new variations t with the same algebra:

t = t = m,
tz = tz  trs/ = (n + 6t) + 2itz,
t = t  trs/z = (n + 6t)z + 2it.

(2.42)

unfortunately, the new transformations leave invariant only the equations of motion
(2.392.41) and not the action (2.32). the reason is that to maintain the invariance
of the action, the expression    to transformations should be a composition of
an antisymmetric matrix with the action variations. however, in (2.42) a symmetric
matrix is used.

3 structure of supercovariant derivatives.

now we begin the description of the formalism with explicit osp(2|4) symmetry. to
develop it we need the osp(2|4)-covariant derivatives and their expressions in terms
of osp(1|4)-covariant operators used previously.
in this section, the following sequence of derivatives (which starts from ordinary
osp(1|4)/so(3, 1) derivatives (1) dened in n = 1 ads superspace) is constructed:
osp(1|4)/su(2), osp(2|4)/h and osp(2|4)/(su(2)  u(1))  osp(2|4)/u(2). two
latter sets of osp(2|4)-covariant derivatives will be used in the explicitly n = 2
invariant formulation of higher-spin equations. we will construct every set in this
sequence in terms of the preceding one. in this way, all the expressions for covariant
derivatives may be expressed in terms of osp(1|4)/so(3, 1) ones, that provides us
with the possibility to make a bridge between various n = 2 covariant equations and
those of n = 1 gks theory.

let us sketch our technology. recall that, according to general facts collected
in app.a, the derivatives covariant with respect to a (super)group g are standardly
determined for every coset space g/h where h is the local subgroup. in particular,
given a supergroup g of dimension (p|q) and a supergroup h of dimension (p|q),
there exist (p  p|q q) covariant derivatives for g/h coset space, and the rest (p|q)
generators span a local h supergroup.
we will start with (4|4) osp(1|4)/so(3, 1) covariant derivatives in n = 1 ads
space m 4|4. then we will observe that the extension of m 4|4 by a constrained lorentz
four vector r  (being the essence of gks formulation) can be considered as the (7|4)-
dimensional homogeneous space osp(1|4)/su(2), and build corresponding (7|4) co-
variant derivatives. to this aim, we introduce a small vielbein eld (3.13, 3.14) and
construct the m 7|4 derivatives via m 4|4 ones and the small vielbein (subsection 3.1).
further, the osp(2|4)/h superspace has the same dimension (7|4) as the superspace
osp(1|4)/su(2), and the numbers of covariant derivatives in these spaces are equal.
in fact, these new n = 2 covariant derivatives in a certain basis are given by n = 1
ones, this is shown in subsection 3.2. it will remain to build the m 7|8 superspace

14

(subsection 3.3), which diers from two previous ones by the number of odd coor-
dinates. we will not inrtroduce these new odd coordinates  explicitly, instead, we
describe an m 7|8 supereld by its m 7|4 proections, associated with  = 0 components
of its covariant derivatives.

before starting the superspace building process let us make a remark. note that
the supergroup h serves as a local supegroup for osp(2|4)/h-covariant derivatives.
the corresponding superelds in the coset space carry the indices which transform
under the supergroup (we call superindices the indices of such a kind). therefore
these indices are graded, they have even and odd parts. for example, one has the
superindex  (c.2):  = (+a, ++). the correspondinng supereld has the odd part
+a and the even part ++ (and each of them has even and odd components after an
expansion in power series by odd coordinates). as far as we know superelds with
superindices have not yet been used in physically interesting models. in sect.6, we
present the models with these superelds.

3.1 osp(1|4)/su(2)-covariant derivatives.

consider the supermanifold m 7|4 parametrized by coordinates (z, r) dened in sect.2.
the dynamical superelds of the theory under consideration are r-analytic functions
in this supermanifold, (2.30,2.31). the supergroup osp(1|4) acts on m 7|4 transi-
indeed, it acts transitively on the supermanifold m 4|4 parametrized by z,
tively.
then, the stability subgroup for z  the lorentz group sl(2, c)  acts transitively
on a two-sheeted hyperboloid parametrized by r. the stability subgroup of the point
(z, r)  m 7|4 is su(2). according to app. a, there exist osp(1|4)/su(2) covariant
derivatives in this superspace m 7|4. in this subsection, we nd their expressions in
terms of covariant derivatives (2.2) of superspace m 4|4. our guide is the requirement
for osp(1|4)/su(2) covariant derivatives, together with local generators of su(2), to
form the superalgebra osp(1|4). it is convenient to introduce su(2)-covariant basis in
this superalgebra which has the following structure

(3.1)
the superalgebra osp(1|4) is dened by the following commutation relations equiva-
lent to (2.2):

i = {a(2), a, }.

sa(2),

[sa(2), sb(2)] = 2absab,

[sa(2), b(2)] = 2abab,

[sa(2), b] = aba,

[, a(2)] = a(2),

[, a] = 

1

a,

[++a(2), b(2)] = 4ab(sab  ab),

[a(2), b] = 2aba,
{a, a} = a(2),

with reality conditions

{a, b} = sab  ab.

(sa(2)) = sa(2)

(a(2)) = a(2)

(3.9)

commutation relations (3.2), together with reality conditions (3.8), dene the su(2)
algebra. the rules (3.8,3.9) reect the fact that the complex conjugate of the funda-
mental representation of su(2) is equivalent to its contragredient representation.

let us now discuss the connection between the considered basis i , sa(2) and the
basis da, m(2), m (2) (2.2) used in the previous section. to express the former via
the latter we need to pass to su(2)-covariant indices. note that conjugation rules
for generators da, m(2), m (2) are as follows:

(m(2)) = m (2),

(d ) = d ,

(d) = d 

(3.10)

that is why if d is transformed under the fundamental representation of su(2),
then d  is transformed under the contragredient one. therefore we should dene

m(ab) = m(),

m (ab) = m(  ), da,b = d

, da = d,

da =  d ,

(3.11)

here, in every equality, a and b take the same values as  and  (or  and ),
respectively. now, the commutation relations (3.23.7) are connected with (2.2) by
the expressions

a(2) = da,a  i( ma(2)  ma(2)),

sa(2) = (ma(2) + ma(2)),

the covariant derivatives (we denote them i) possessing the required algebra
and reality conditions should depend both on z and r. to nd their expressions, rst

.

16

let us remind that the lorentz generators m(2), m (2) enter the connection parts
of covariant derivatives da in all formulas of sect. 2. these generators do not act on
the indices of vector r . their action on a scalar supereld (r) is equivalent to the
action of the following operators

~m(2) =

1

r

 ,

~m (2) =

1
2

r 

 ,

  



r 

(3.15)

that preserve the constraint r2 = 1 and therefore are (complex) vector elds on the
hyperboloid. let us introduce operators m(2), m (2) that act on all indices ,  and
include the dierential operator:
m(2)ea
m(2)r   ~m(2)r  + r  = 0,
m(2)(r)  ~m(2)(r)

  ~m(2)ea

 + ea

(3.16)

,

and conjugated expressions for m (2). then dene two sets of modied covariant
derivatives da, substituting either ~m(2) or m(2) instead of m(2) in the connection
terms:

then we have the following equations for an arbitrary su(2) spinor supereld a(z, r):

~da  da|m  ~m ,

da  da|m  m .

daa(z, r) = ~daa(z, r) = daa(z, r),

da dba(z, r) = dadba(z, r)

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

now we choose (7|4) independent vector elds:
 ~d  = (a(2)),
ea
a(2)  ea
ea
ea
a(2)  iea
 ~d  = (a)
 ~d,

note their useful properties:

a(2)r  = 2iea

ar  = 0

in the analogous equation for a, the connection parts of covariant derivatives act on
r  and do not give zero. making use of these equations, all independent rst order
derivatives of the small vielbein prove to be described by the expressions

and complex conjugated.

(3.23)

to derive the algebra of the vector elds a(2), a it is sucient to calculate the
algebra of the modied operators a(2), a since, due to (3.19), these algebras coin-
cide modulo curvature terms with local rotations m(2). the latter algebra can be
derived straightforwardly using the commutation relations for da (given by (2.2))
along with the substitution da  da, m  m . in so doing one can deduce that
the supercommutators of vector elds a(2), a close on themselves with coecients
of non-holonomicity being proportional to tensor superelds v, u, w, and y.

now we are in a position to construct the operators

b(2)sb(2),
b(2)sb(2),

la(2) = a(2)  va(2)
da(2) = a(2) + ua(2)

(3.26)

(3.27)

acting on sections of su(2) ber bundle over m 7|4, with sa(2) representing local su(2)
generators. in fact, these expressions already dene osp(1|4)/su(2)-covariant deriva-
tives, but for our purpose it is more convenient to make a linear substitution

+a =

j

a(2) = da(2)  la(2),
a =  j

2 (da + da),

2 (da  da).

(3.28)

(3.29)

using the algebra of vector elds (3.18) one can show that the introduced operators
i, along with sab local rotations, obey the superalgebra osp(1|4) (3.43.7). they also
satisfy the reality conditions (3.9). the obtained results exhibit a general situation,
briey discussed in app. a. suppose that we have two homogeneous manifolds g/l
and g/h for the same group g, and h is a subgroup of l, h  l  g. then there
exists a general expression for g/h-derivatives via g/l-ones. the small vielbein eld
can be viewed as an object which parametrizes dierent embeddings l/h  l.

3.2 osp(2|4)-covariant derivatives in m 7|4.
here we construct other covariant derivatives in the same supermanifold m 7|4,
where the derivatives i were dened previously. the point is that, according to
sect.1, this supermanifold can be considered as the homogeneous manifold osp(2|4)/h
for n = 2 ads supergroup osp(2|4), the corresponding vector elds spanning osp(2|4)
superalgebra are given by eqs.(2.26, 2.27). here, as it is mentioned in the introduc-
tion, h denotes the (super)subgroup of the supergroup osp(2|4), associated with
superalgebra su(2, 0|1, 0)  osp(2|4). note that the bosonic part of su(2, 0|1, 0) coin-
cides with u(2) = so(3) so(2). the algebra of the corresponding osp(2|4)-covariant
derivatives and local rotations is osp(2|4) superalgebra. we denote these osp(2|4)/h

18

derivatives by the same letter as the corresponding generators in (1.81.10,1.151.20)
with the additional emphasis . the local rotations are denoted identically with the
generators of a(1|0):

local rotations
covariant derivatives

sa(2), t =   s/2, d
a(2), d

a, d = /2  s/2

a

(3.30)

the commutation relations in this basis can be read o (1.81.10,1.151.20) after
switching from , s to t , d. to derive the osp(2|4)-covariant derivatives (3.30) in
terms of derivatives i constructed in the previous subsection, it is convenient to pass
to a new basis. let us recall the odd generators d1
a and
d

a by the rules (1.7). introduce the notation

a related to d

a and d2

a = d2

a = 

1
2

( d

a  d

a),

 = t  2 d.

(3.31)

strictly speaking, a and  are no longer pure covariant derivatives for osp(2|4)/h
but the combinations of covariant derivatives and local h rotations. therefore, the
supercommutator of a with local rotations d
a is not a linear combination of
bosonic covariant derivatives and contains explicitly local rotations sa(2). neverthe-
less, it is possible to consider the following basis of operators (the set of generators
d

a forms the basis in the odd subspace of superalgebra osp(2|4)):

a, d2

sa(2), t, d
a
a(2), a, 

h - local rotations
combinations

(3.32)
(3.33)
now our task reduces to nding the operators i. the basis (3.32,3.33) for osp(2|4)
was chosen so that generators i, sa(2) span osp(1|4) subalgebra, which can be derived
from eqs.(1.81.10,1.151.20). this means that the commutators of operators i
close on i and sa(2) and coincide with those of derivatives i explicitly constructed
in the previous subsection. that is why we can identify the desired combinations
(3.33) with the available operators (3.283.29). thus we do not need to construct
any new objects to built osp(2|4)/h covariant derivatives. in this reasoning, we have
used the fact that the whole superalgebra osp(2|4) can be spanned by two intersecting
subalgebras: osp(1|4) with basis i , sa(2) and subalgebra of local rotations sa(2), d
a,
t . the action of osp(1|4) was dened in the subsection 3.1 while the local rotations
act by denition on the indices of covariant derivatives. of course, we can go back to
the basis (3.30) that appears to be more convenient in what follows:

2 a + d
d
a = 
a,
d =  /2 + t /2.

(3.34)
(3.35)

let us overview the subsection results. even covariant derivatives a(2) are given by
(3.28). odd derivatives d
a and scalar derivative d are given by (3.34), where a, 

19

are osp(1|4)-covariant derivatives (3.26,3.29) and d
a, t are local rotations. let us
stress that here only a particular solution is found for osp(2|4)/h-derivatives. that
is why it is not h-invariant and the connections, corresponding to local generators
d
a and t are xed constants. to obtain a general solution, one has to perform a
general local h-rotation of the constructed covariant derivatives. nevertheless, this
particular solution is convenient for the component analysis of the supereld models
considered in the following sections.

3.3 osp(2|4)-covariant derivatives in m 7|8.
here we study osp(2|4)/u(2) derivatives and their relation to the derivatives
constructed in the previous section. we denote the set of these derivatives by the
same letters as the corresponding generators of osp(2|4) superalgebra :

local rotations
covariant derivatives

sa(2), t, d
a
di = {a(2), d

a, d} and d = {d

a}.

(3.36)

first, let us consider the coset superspace h/u(2), parametrized by four odd
coordinates . let us call da the corresponding odd covariant derivatives with local
rotations sa(2), t . the algebra of covariant derivatives coincides with the (real form
of) a(1|0) superalgebra written out in eq.(c.1). note that every supereld  in this
supermanifold is described by 24 = 16 coecients of the decomposition by power
series in odd coordinates . since the covariant derivatives da are independent the
following projections can be chosen for these coecients:

|, da|, da

da|  (d)2|,

[d+a, db]|,

db(d)2|,

(d)2(d)2|

(3.37)

where | denotes the null component ( = 0).
now let us discuss the relation of osp(2|4)/u(2) covariant derivatives in m 7|8
to the odd derivatives for h/su(2) and osp(2|4)/h derivatives constructed in the
previous subsections. here it is convenient to introduce a shorthand notations. di =
{ a(2), d
a, d} are covariant derivatives from (3.28,3.34,3.35); l = {da} are
just introduced odd derivatives in h/u(2), while l = {d
a} are odd local rotations
from (3.34); sa = {sa(2), t} are bosonic generators of local algebra u(2); at last
x = {z, r} are coordinates of the superspace m 7|4. then the derivatives di and l
have the following structure:

di = ei + i
l = e + 

(x)l + i
a()sa

a(x)sa

(3.38)
(3.39)

where es are vielbein vector superelds and s are connections5. the derivatives di
satisfy the superalgebra osp(2|4), while l form the a(1|0) superalgebra

5it follows from (3.34) that i

[ di, dj ] = f k
ij
[l, l] = f 
l + f a

dk + f 
ijl + f a
sa

(3.40)
(3.41)
 are constants in that particular basis for osp(2|4)/h derivatives.

ij sa,

20

where the structure constants f s can be found in (1.81.10,1.151.20). let us seek
for osp(2|4)/u(2) covariant derivatives di, d in the following form:

j (x, )ej + ei

(x, )l + i

a(x, )sa,

(3.42)
(3.43)
(3.44)

di = ei
d = l,
j(x, 0) = j
i ,

ei

(x, 0) = i

,

a(x, 0) = i

a.

eqs.(3.44) give the initial conditions for the vielbeins ei and the connection i. then
we have to impose the following equations which dene the dependence of di on s:

[l, di] = f j

idj .

(3.45)

calculating the supercommutator and using the relations [e, di] = 0 and [l, sa] =
f 
al, we obtain dierential equations for ei, i of the following form:

eei

j (x, ) + . . . = 0,

eei

(x, ) + . . . = 0,

ei

a(x, ) + . . . = 0

(3.46)

with dots standing for terms without derivatives. this system of dierential equations
is self-consistent as it is checked using jacobi identities for the constants f , eqs.(3.43)
and the identity

[l, [l, di]] + [l, [l, di]] + [[l, l], di] = 0.

the self-consistency of the equations (3.46) and the linear independence of the vector
elds e assures the existence and uniqueness of a solution for ei and i with the
initial conditions (3.44). to ensure that this solution gives osp(2|4)/h derivatives we
have to check the supercommutator [di, dj ]. due to linear independence of operators
di, l and sa in every point, the supercommutator [di, dj ] can be expanded in this
basis, with some function coecients f (x, ):

[di, dj ] = f k

ij (x, )dk + f 

ij(x, )l + f a

ij (x, )sa

(3.47)

then f (x, 0) = f  the structure constants of the superalgebra osp(2|4). really, the
operator l in eq.(3.47) (and also inside operators di (3.42)) can be replaced by
the local generators l with the same algebra and action on di (3.45). the null
is equal to di, whence the null component
component of the obtained operator dll
of the equation (3.47) converts into (3.40) that provides the equation f (x, 0) = f =
const. then, taking the commutator of la with the equation (3.47), we get the
dierential equations on -dependence of f (x, ). with the use of (3.41,3.45) these
equations can be reduced to form

i

eaf (x, ) + . . . = 0,

(3.48)

the dots are standing for terms without derivatives. these equations have the unique
solution which is constant, f (x, ) = f . so we have proved that the new covariant

21

a, d} and d = {d

derivatives di = {a(2), d
a} satisfy the superalgebra
osp(2|4).
a general supereld in osp(2|4)/u(2) is represented locally by a set of functions
pa(k), carrying a nite-dimensional representation of u(2) algebra with a(k) repre-
senting basis of su(2) rank-k symmetric spinor representation, and p/2 being the u(1)
t -weight. in this paper only the case k = 0 appears.

analogously to the superelds in superspace h/u(2) (3.37), all the content of an
arbitrary supereld p(z, r, ) in superspace m 7|8 is given by the following component
superelds in m 7|4:

p|, d

ap|, da
b(d

the initial conditions (3.44), together with eqs.(3.34,3.35) and the fact that i
(3.42) are constant superelds gives us the following component rules:

4 the chiral superelds on m 7|8.

we introduce the main building blocks of the n = 2 covariant equations to be con-
structed, the strongly chiral elds on m 7|8.

a one-component supereld on m 7|8 is called weakly chiral if it satises the con-

straint

eap = 0,

where ea is one piece from the four odd covariant derivatives pieces on m 7|8 :

ea = d+

+a or d+

a or d

+a or d
a.

(4.1)

(4.2)

the strongly chiral elds are dened to be weakly chiral w.r.t. two special pieces
from eq.(4.2). namely, the strongly chiral eld of a rst kind is dened by the
constraints

d+

+ap = d

ap = 0  p = 0.

(4.3)

it is clear from the commutation relations (1.9) that in this case a strongly chiral eld
should carry zero t -weight.

22

the strongly chiral eld of a second kind is dened by the constraints in which

the two covariant derivatives pieces have equal -weights and, therefore, commute:

d+

+ap = d+

ap = 0

or

d

+ap = d

ap = 0

(4.4)

(4.5)

in these cases, there are no restrictions on the t -weight. note that the supereld 
can be real,  = , while p is necessarily complex, as the complex congugation  
maps the covariant derivatives d+
lets study the m 7|4 component content of strongly chiral elds along the previous
section lines. it is clear that the strongly chiral eld of the rst kind possess the unique
unconstrained component (z, r) = 0|, the rest components like (d+
+a0)| are zero by
virtue of constraints (4.3).
technically, the situation for the chiral elds of a second kind is more involved.

the rest components like (d+

(4.4). we have to analize how the remaining constraint y +

in terms of the a, a, b leds by studying the components of this equation. there are

(4.10)
here we have used formulas (3.503.52) and osp(1|4) covariant derivatives  in su-
permanifold m 7|4. the rst and the third groups show that a and b are expressed
via the unconstrained eld a. the second and the fourth groups prove to be the
consequences of the rst and the third ones and do not lead to any restriction on
a. thus, the chiral eld of the second kind p is equivalent to the unconstrained
m 7|4-supereld, being expressed by the rst projection a = p|.
as far as the component content of either of the considered strongly chiral su-
perelds reduces to one unconstrained eld in m 7|4, they can be chosen on the role
of dynamical variables in physical models. though both these components are sim-
ilar superelds in m 7|4, their n = 2 supersymmetry transformations dier. one
can show that for  = 0| the transformations of the second supersymmetry (2.19),
parametrized by killing scalar t, are realized by the operator m (2.27). this means
that the osp(2|4) representation carried by  is an ordinary regular representation on

23

the functions in homogeneous space. however, for a = p|, the second supersymme-
try is given by the operator n whose action on the real and imaginary parts of a is
similar to the action on the superelds z and  in (2.42).

the strongly chiral elds of a third kind are dened to obey the constraints

d+

ap = d

(4.11)
one may show that such a eld possesses just one constrained component on m 7|4:
 = p|, (3p + 4 ) = 0, and all higher components are expressed via .

5 equations of motion for higher spin superelds

with manifest n = 2 supersymmetry.

in this section, we present explicitly n = 2 supersymmetric equations equivalent to
(2.392.41). they are the dynamical equations for higher spin elds formulated in
superspace m 7|8 = osp(2|4)/u(2). according to app. a, in this superspace there
exist the covariant derivatives a(2), d
a and d that satisfy the osp(2|4)
superalgebra (1.81.10,1.151.20) together with local rotations sa(2) and t . the
explicit expressions for these derivatives in terms of osp(1|4)-covariant objects are
derived in sect. 3, and used below in the component analysis.
let us begin to formulate the theory. the superelds on m 7|8 are characterized by
their su(2) indices and t -weights. dynamical variables are strongly chiral superelds

(5.6)

which is valid for scalars with zero weight w.r.t. generator t . the null m 7|4 compo-
nent of  is nothing but the gauge parameter of gks formulation (2.18).

using the previous section results one concludes that the component content of
superelds (5.1) is characterized by one real and one complex scalar in m 7|4. this
means that neither auxiliary nor pure gauge degrees of freedom were added to the
dynamical content of the model (2.33). it can be considered as the reection of the
fact that though the n = 2 invariance (2.42) of the equations of motion (2.392.41)
is implicit, its algebra closes o-shell and without gauge additions (2.38). one can
see that the manifest n = 2 supersymmetry (realized on superelds (5.1) in terms
of a canonical left action of a group on its homogeneous space), gives the laws (2.42)
on the component level. this canonical action in m 7|8 is given by a killing operator
analogous to operator k (2.26) in m 7|4, and its component form can be derived with
help of rules of component analysis formulated in the end of subsection 3.3. it agrees
with the fact that the components z,  and  from (2.33) decompose in two n = 2
superelds ++
 and  (5.1). the coincidence of this explicit symmetry with (2.42)
means that it does not leave the action invariant (see sect.2). that is why though
the proposed equations of motion are lagrangian and the corresponding action is
n = 2-supersymmetric, it cannot be expressed in explicitly osp(2|4)-invariant form
via the superelds ++
 and . nevertheless, there still remains the question if there
exists a formulation with an explicit realization of the supersymmetry t (2.35). in
such a formulation, the action would have to possess the manifestly invariant form.
now we investigate the component form of the equations (5.2,5.3). to begin with,
consider the null components of these equations.
it was shown in sect.4 that the
supereld  contains only one independent real component (which we also denote )
and the supereld ++

 has only one independent complex component a.

now we are in a position to consider  = 0 components of the equations (5.2,5.3).
to calculate them one should , rst of all, pass to osp(1|4)-covariant derivatives i
by the formulas (3.503.52) and denitions (5.7,5.8) for components. second, one
should use the expressions (3.243.29) for these derivatives. at last, one has to pass

25

to sl(2, c) covariant indices by (3.18). then all the dependence on the small vielbein
and its derivatives (3.203.23) disappear and one is rest with ordinary n = 1 ads
superspace covariant equations on m 7|4. in so doing we come to the following two
equations:

1
2

(i(p  p) +
i

2

( + 1)a = {i(p  p) 

(q + q)}.

1
2

(q + q))a  c.c. = 16i(p + p  1),

(5.9)

(5.10)

these equations convert into (2.392.41) after the identication a = 4(z + i). the
real equation (5.9) turns into (2.41) while the complex equation (5.10) gives the sum
(2.39) + i(2.40). so, it is proved that the dynamical equations (5.2,5.3) for superelds
(5.1) lead to the original higher spin gks equations (2.392.41).

let us discuss the higher components of equations of motion (5.2,5.3) and prove
that they do not imply any new information. first note that the second equation
(5.3) is strongly chiral, it satises identically the same constraints the supereld ++

does. a strongly chiral supereld of this type has only one independent component 
its null component (see the previous section). hence the equation (5.10) in superspace
m 7|4 is equivalent to the supereld equation (5.3).

the situation with the rst equation (5.2) is a bit more complicated. it is conve-
nient to consider this equation in the gauge  = 0 which admissibility is shown after
+ d
eq.(2.34). let us introduce a weakly chiral supereld b = da
+ab  0.
then, the equations of motion (5.2,5.3) in this gauge take the form

, d

+a++

e  b + b = 0,
(d  2)++
 = 0

(5.11)
(5.12)

to ascertain that all the components of the equation (5.11) are derivatives of the
null one we use eq.(5.12) which is already shown to be equivalent to (5.10) with
 = 0. thereby (5.2) follows from the couple of equations (5.9,5.10), not from the
only eq.(5.9). using the algebra (1.81.10,1.151.20) of covariant derivatives the
following relation can be derived straightforwardly

d+

ab = d+

adb

+ d

+b++

 = 8d+

a(2  d)++



thus we come to the additional constraint d+
d
satised, the supereld e obeys the constraints

ab = 0 on supereld b (note that
ab = 0 implies db = 0 as it follows from (1.10)). so, if eq.(5.12) is

+ab = d+

d

+ae = d+

ae = 0

(5.13)

therefore, e is a third kind strongly chiral supereld which possesses only one inde-
pendent component e| (see sec. 4), this completes the proof.

26

6 picture changing and manifestly n = 2 super-

symmetric equations on m 7|4.

in this section, we show that the whole system of equations and constraints on m 7|8
(5.15.3) may be equivalently reformulated as a system of equations and constraints on
m 7|4 = osp(2|4)/h. this framework seems to be quite natural since, from the n = 1
viewpoint, m 7|4 is just that manifolfd the original manifestly n = 1 supersymmetric
theory was dened.

calculations of this section do not deal with n = 1 component expressions, and
n = 2 covariance is kept manifest. it is convenient therefore to introduce a universal
notation: given an osp(2|4) coset space, both the covariant derivatives and local
rotations are denoted by the same letter d (except for local rotations sa(2) and t )
diering by the indices they carry according to their place in osp(2|4) superalgebra. in
what follows, we use two equivalent notations for components of osp(2|4) generators
d, d and d. first, we use the index notation introduced in app. c:  = (a, z),
 = (a, z), etc., where a, a are su(2)-indices and z, z denote the single bosonic value
of superindices ,  respectively. then, we also use the notation explicitly indicating
t -weights. the following expressions include all these notations

d =   dab daz
d =   dab daz
d =  dab daz

dzb dzz ! =  sab  abt d+a
dzb dzz ! =   d2ab d3a
dzb dz z ! =   d2ab d3a

(6.2)

(6.3)

the rest piece of osp(2|4), the scalar derivative is always denoted d. similar nota-
tions are used for superelds, for example, a supersymmetric tensor supereld 123
contains three su(2)-irreducible component elds (6.9). at last, the covariant deriva-
tives in superspaces m 7|8 and m 7|4 are denoted identically; the manifold, on which a
derivative lives, is specied by the supereld this derivative acts.

to start with we observe that there exist special constrained superelds on m 7|8
which are equivalent to the unconstrained m 7|4 ones. indeed, consider a supereld
a(z, r, a) on m 7|8, which takes its values in an su(2, 0|1, 0) fdr (or in a(1|0) fdr,
which is the complexication of su(2, 0|1, 0) ) , the index a just labels this fdrs
basis. let di be su(2, 0|1, 0) generators, di be their image in the covariant deriva-
tives algebra on m 7|8 and (di)a
b be their form in the su(2, 0|1, 0) fdr. impose the
constraints
dia = (di)a
(6.4)

bb.

the even part of these constraints is satised identically as for sab, t generators the
equations (6.4) are just the denition of how these generators enter the whole covari-
ant derivatives algebra (see app. a). the constraints may be solved in a standard

27

way, (at least locally on m 7|8) in terms of local elds on m 7|4 which is identied with
the subspace  = 0 (see sect. 3). a general solution reads

a(z, r, a) = exp(+ad+a + ada)a

bb(z, r, 0)

(6.5)

it establishes a bijection between the m 7|8 constrained elds of the form (6.4-6.5) and
the unconstrained local tensor elds b(z, r, 0)  b(z, r) on m 7|4 transforming in
the same su(2, 0|1, 0) fdr as the original m 7|8 ones. if the representation labeled by a
is irreducible, then, for every xed value of a, the component elds a| , daa| . . .
are obviously in one-to one correspondence with the set of all b(z, r) components;
the pictures arising for dierent a are connected by an a(1|0) transformation.
in order not to be too abstract it is pertinent to introduce now an example and then
illustrate all the ideas on it, the generalization to an arbitrary fdr is straightforward.
consider the a(1|0)representation (2|2)p, p 6= 1 (see appendix c, eqs.
(c.10-
c.11)6.), so the elds a components are (p, p 1 labels the t -weight and a is su(2)
spinor index)

while the constraints (6.4) read (compare to (c.11))

a = (pa , p1 , p+1),

d+b

(6.6)

we see that all the content of superelds a reduces to the component elds of
supereld p+1 because the part of relations (6.6) leads to

pa = 2(1 + p)1dap+1 ; p1 = (d)2p+1,

while the rest constraints imply

d+ap+1 = 0.

(6.7)

(6.8)

so, one can equivalently describe any h-tensor supereld on m 7|4 in two ways: rst,
as a cross section of the h-bundle on m 7|4, second, as a constrained supereld on m 7|8.
we shall refer to the rst way as to m 7|4-picture and to the second one as to m 7|8-
picture. for instance, it is seen that the weakly chiral (w.r.t. d+a derivative) one-
component supereld p+1 on m 7|8 is equivalent to the ip unconstrained supereld
on m 7|4 , p 6= 1, or they form the two pictures of the same osp(2|4) superalgebra
representation.
recall that the n = 2 covariant derivatives on m 7|8 constitute, along with
su(2, 0|1, 0)-inner rotations, the full osp(2|4)-superalgebra which decomposes into di-
rect sum of four graded subspaces w.r.t. su(2, 0|1, 0) (1.261.28). therefore, for the
covariant derivative set the constraints (6.4) are satised identically.

6in this section, we use extensievely the results and notation of appendix c

28

the main result of this section is the observation that all equations and constraints
of sect. 5 constitute the m 7|8 -picture of some m 7|4 tensor equations. first note that,
as is obvious from the above analysis, the constrained elds 6  ++
 and  (5.1)
may be viewed as m 7|8 -picture of m 7|4 tensor elds i5 and , (the strongly chiral
eld  corresponds to the trivial (1|0)-representation). recalling the formula (c.16)
from the app. c we represent the i5 eld as the supersymmetrized product of three
 fdrs : (3), with the highest weight component being identied with 6 :

6| = 6 = zzz , 5a| = 5a = azz , 4| = 4 = baabz

(6.9)

the 6, 5a, 4 supeelds are assumed to obey the equations (6.66.8) with p = 5. it
is clear from the above discussion that, in m 7|4 picture, the counterparts of constraints
d+a6 = 0 are absent. at the same time, the constraint

turns into a tensor equation

d3a6 = 0

d1(2345) = 0.

(6.10)

(6.11)

the round brackets denote supersymmetrization, as usual. as covariant derivatives
d12 are superantisymmetric in its indices, the last tensor equation is characterized
by the young tableaux of the form

to prove the relation (6.11), it is sucient to observe that the rst m 7|4 projection
of (6.10) presents the highest-weight component of (6.11) and the next projections,
associated with all da derivatives of (6.10), are identied with the rest components
it is important that one should not break the h-
of the tensor equation (6.11).
covariant structures by passing to the n = 1 components as in sections 3 and 4.
indeed, consider the basis in osp(2|4) superalgebra introduced in (3.32,3.33). then it
follows from eqs.(3.503.52) that for combinations i (3.33), the relation holds:

(ia)| = i(a|)

(6.12)

due to the constraints (6.4) the same equation is valid for all generators d 
osp(2|4):
(6.13)

(da)| = d(a|)

where in r.h.s. d acts as the local rotation on index a. so, these equations are
satised for every generator of osp(2|4) and give the osp(2|4)-covariant way to pass
to m 7|4-components of superelds in m 7|8. for example, one has

(d3a6)| = d3a(6|) = dzazzz = 24dz(azzz)

(6.14)

29

for the rst m 7|4 projection, or

(dbd3a6)| =
= dbd3a(6|) = [dbd3a]6  d3ada6 = ++ba6  3d3a5b =
= dbdzazzz = dbazzz  3dzabzz = 24da(bzzz)

(6.15)

for the db-projection, and so on. this proves the eq. (6.11).

to nd the picture changed m 7|4 reformulation of two equations (5.2,5.3) introduce
supersymmetric third-rank tensor operators (for the denition of invariant seven-rank
c-tensors, see app.c, eqs.(c.24-c.28))

123 = d 2 1d 2 1 c 1 2; 1 2;123

then, the m 7|4 picture of equations (5.2,5.3) looks as follows (the [=] symbol means

4(cid:16)(3)(3)  ()(3)(3)(3)(3)(cid:17) [=]  8i (cc  2ccc) 

indeed, the zzz-component of the rst equation and the zzz, zzz component of
the second equation are

 1
4zzz = i(d  2)zzz

1

4 (zzzzzz  zzzzzz) = 8i(z z  2)

30

(6.21)

which, after accounting the component form of the operators (6.17,6.19) are seen to co-
incide with m 7|4-projection of eq. (5.2,5.3) upon the identication 6  ++
, 6 =

++. it remains to check that the rest components of eq.(6.20) are in one to one
correspondence with all components of m 7|8 equations (5.2, 5.3). we have performed
this check explicitly and have found they match indeed.

the m 7|4 -picture of gauge invariance reads

(3) =  1

4 (3) ,

 = id

(6.22)

where  is a real scalar eld presenting the unique m 7|4 projection of the strongly
chiral eld of a rst kind  on m 7|8.

this is easy to prove since the zzz component of the rst equation gives null
component of the gauge transformation law (5.4) and the rest components coincide
with  = 0 projections of the da-derivatives of this law; the only component of the
second equation is identical to the only null component of (5.5). on the other hand,
one may check the gauge invariance in m 7|4-picture directly, by using the covariant
derivatives algebra (1.321.37).

thus, we have observed that the higher spin equations (5.2,5.3) are well dened
on m 7|4 and derived such a picture. it is characterized by two m 7|4-superelds (3)
and  satisfying the equations (6.11,6.20), which turn out to be gauge invariant w.r.t.
transformations (6.22).

a few remarks are in order. recall that the fdrs (3) (3) and (2) (2) have equal
dimension (see app.c), therefore there is no information loss if one takes the rst
trace of the second equation (6.20) by an invariant second rank tensor c  (c.6 -
c.8):

1

4(cid:16)(2)
[=]  8i(cid:16) 4

(2)  ()(2)(2)(2)
9 cc
9 c + 1

(2)(cid:17) [=]
3 cc(cid:17) 

 + 1

(6.23)

now we apply the analysis of (2) (2) representation from appendix c (c.33 - c.44)
to the l.h.s. and the r.h.s. of the last equation.

obviously, the r.h.s  htrace  h 7|8 where h 7|8 is a subspace of double-traceless
tensors and htrace is dened by (c.38). therefore, the l.h.s. obeys this condition
either. the relation l.h.s  h 7|8 leads to the covariant -independent consequence of
(6.23):
(6.24)

1

4(cid:16)(3)(3)  (3)(3)(cid:17) = 0

further, htrace is a general solution of the constraints (c.42 , c.44) so one gets

0 [=] c(2);

(2)

(2) (l.h.s.)(2)(2)
;

0 [=] c(2);

(2)

(2) (l.h.s.)(2)(2) ,

;

31

(6.25)

i.e. two additional -independent consequences of eq. (6.23). here l.h.s. means left
hand side of the eq.(6.23).

in the m 7|8-picture, these consequences are expressed via the constraint

(d)2 (r.h.s.) = (d)2 (8i(z z  2))  = 0,

therefore, the l.h.s. should obey these equations either:

(d)2 1
4

(zzz6  zzz6) = 0

(6.26)

(6.27)

the m 7|4-projections of the da - derivatives of the last equation give rise to tensor
equations (6.25), which include only (3) and not . all these additional equations
are gauge-invariant as the equations (6.11, 6.20) are.

7 conclusion.

let us summarize the results. we succeeded in constructing two manifestly n = 2
covariant formulations for the equations of motion of gks theory [1], which describes
free massless elds of all superspins in d = 4 ads space in terms of a few scalar
leds on m 7|4. the rst formulation is achieved through employing the constrained
(strongly chiral) superleds in n = 2 superspace m 7|8 = osp(2|4)/u(2) while the
second one uses a smaller superspace m 7|4 = osp(2|4)/su(2, 0|1, 0) which, from
n = 1 veiwpoint, is just the same manifold the original gks theory is dened. the
obtained equations have a neat form and, in a sense, look simpler than n = 1 ones.
unfortunately, all of this does not give a possibility to construct an n = 2 man-
ifestly invariant form of the action, since the laws of global n = 2 transformations,
which follow from the supereld formalism developed in the paper, dier from those
leaving the action invariant by terms proportional to the equation of motion multi-
plied by a symmetric matrix.

however, there still exist a lot of possibilities to improve the situation. here we
discuss how one can try to construct an explicitly n = 2 invariant action. as far as
the action is not invariant w.r.t. transformations  (2.42), one should make explicit
the supersymmetry  (2.35). these transformations have the structure of a semidirect
sum and an invariant subspace extracted by the equation  = 0 exists. note that the
algebra of global transformations |=0 is determined by the algebra of vector elds n
(2.36); the addition of scalar t with an arbitrary factor does not change the algebra.
thus there is a one-parameter set of multiplets, each multiplet consists of two real
superelds (z, ) transforming through each other by the laws diering from |=0 by
the addition of scalar t with an arbitrary factor.
(a,b) =
osp(2|4)/su(2) u(1)(a,b) where the su(2) generators are the same as for m 7|8 while
the u(1)(a,b) generator is taken as a + bs (in the present paper we dealt with a =

on the other hand, it is possible to construct dierent versions of m 7|8 as m 7|8

32

1, b =  1
2 ). then one has to study diverse chiral superelds on these manifolds just
analogously to the procedure of sec. (4) and nd those reducing to unconstrained
supeelds on m 7|4. the existence of the superelds of such a kind is hinted by the
observed evidence of one-parametric family of nonequivalent osp(2|4) multiplets. it
is probably that, at some specic value of (a, b), the chiral superelds on m 7|8
(a,b) may
be found which reproduce the semidirect type global supersymmetry laws  for its
m 7|4 components. then there should exist a manifestly supersymmetric action.

appendix a. covariant derivatives on a coset space.
let us consider a group g, its subgroup h and the homogeneous space m = g/h.
the group g can be treated as a principle bre bundle (g,m,h) with the base space
m and the structure group = standard bre h. this is the bre bundle of the
group in its cosets. all the covariant derivatives used in the present paper arise in a
construction of this type. here we give general formulas and argue the existence of
covariant derivatives.

let xa, a = 1, . . . , dim h be a basis in lie algebra lh of subgroup h. the rst
supposition we have to do is that the set of vectors xa can be complemented by
vectors x,  = 1, . . . , dim g  dim h to give the basis {xa, x} in lie algebra lg
of g so that the commutation relations are partially graded:

[xa, xb] = c c
[xa, x] = c 
[x, x] = c 

abxc,
ax,
x + c a

(lh is subalgebra,)
c b
xa.

a = 0,

(a.1)
(a.2)
(a.3)

note that this choice of vectors x can always be done if lg is a semisimple algebra
and lh do not contain null vectors. then x can be chosen in to belong to orthogonal
complement of lh. for the factor-spaces considered in this work the choice with (a.2)
is always possible. but if we chose the (abelian) subalgebra spanned by d+
a in the
superalgebra osp(2|4) (1.81.10,1.151.20), a choice with (a.2) would be impossible.
this could cause problems in attempts to construct covariant derivatives.
now we turn to the principle bundle (g,m,h). let  : g  m be canonical
(a.4)

projection

(gh) = gh  m  m

g  g,

h  h

where left coset gh is to be treated as a point of manifold m. a bre bundle is
dened by trivializations for every open domain u from an open covering of base

33

space m. trivialization is a one-to-one map  satisfying

 : u  h  1(u)  g,

  (m, h) = m.

in our case this trivialization reduces to a smooth function g(m) which maps u  g
and satises (g(m)) = m. then (m, h) = g(m)h.
j be matrices of a representation of subgroup h in a vector space v in some

let hi

basis:

[hv]i = hi

jvj,

where vi are components of a vector v  v . it is known that there is the unique
vector bundle (e, h, v, h) associated with principle bundle (g, m, h) and the chosen
representation of subgroup h in a standard bre v . let e be canonical projection
in e which maps the bre vm over the point m to m: e(vm) = m. sections s(m) in
the vector bundle can be described by vector functions v : g  v constrained by

hi

jvj(gh) = vi(g)

g  g,

h  h.

(a.5)

the bases in bres vm = 1
e (m) are dened by the trivialization g(m). the com-
ponents of the section corresponding to the function v(g) (a.5) in these bases look
like

si(m) = vi(g(m)).

(a.6)

the left action of the group g on its homogeneous manifold is dened as

f  g

df : m  m,

df (gh) = f gh,

df m = (f g(m)).

this action induces the regular representation of the group g in the space of scalar
functions  in the manifold m:

tf (m) = (df 1m).

analogously the regular representation of the group g in the space of sections in the
vector bundle e can be dened.
it is easier to do in terms of vector functions v
(a.5,a.6):

tf v(g) = v(f 1g).

(a.7)

it is evident that new function tf v also satises the equation (a.5) and thus denes
some section. we can write this action in the innitesimal form:
for every vector
x  lg

txv(g) = lv(g)

(a.8)

here l is right-invariant vector eld corresponding to x,

l(g) = xg  drgx,

rgg = gg

(a.9)

where drg is the dierential of the right shift rg (a right-invariant vector eld gen-
erates left action and therefore denoted l).

34

let us denote la, l right-invariant and ra, r left-invariant vector elds corre-

sponding to basis vector elds xa, x:

la(g) = xag, xg  drgx
l(g) = xg,
r(g) = gx, ra(g) = gxa, gx  dlgx

(a.10)

where lgg = gg. it is convenient to introduce also dual basis of 1-forms

l  l = 
 ,

la  lb = a
b ,

l  lb = la  l = 0

and the same for r, ra via r, ra . dots stand for the contraction of vector with
1-form. then, in every trivialization, the connection in the principle bundle is the
lie algebra valued 1-form in the base space being equal to

a = (gla)xa

(a.11)

where gla is the pull-back of the 1-form la from point g(m) to point m. the exterior
covariant derivative is equal to

d = d + (gla)xa.

(a.12)

to obtain the usual covariant derivative the vielbein vector eld e and its inverse
1-form have to be introduced in the base space:

e = gr,

e = d(r(g(m))),

(a.13)

here d is the dierential of the canonical projection. one can show that e  e = 
 .
then the covariant derivatives are

d = e  d = e + a

ax,

a

a = e  (gr).

(a.14)

consider a section s in a vector bundle with a representation t of group h on
a bre. then ds is also a section in the vector bundle associated with the same
principle bundle and with the representation t ad in a bre. here ad denotes the
restriction of adjoint representation of subgroup h to the linear envelope of vectors
x. further, one can show that

dsi(m) = rvi(g(m)),

(a.15)

the action of covariant derivative on the section s equals to the action of left-invariant
vector eld on the function vi(g) (a.6). that is why derivatives d commute with left
innitesimal action (a.8) of the algebra lg on sections. in this sense these derivatives
are covariant. the action of local rotations ma on a section can be generated by the
action of vector elds ra on the corresponding function v(g) in the group as follows
from innitesimal form of eq.(a.5). hence the algebra of covariant derivatives and

35

local rotations coincides with the algebra of left-invariant vector elds, that is with
algebra lg:

[ma, mb] = c c
[ma,d] = c 
[d,d] = c 

abmc,
ad,
d + c a

ma.

(a.16)
(a.17)
(a.18)

let us emphasize that the covariant derivatives d were expressed for general
case in terms of geometrical objects (left and right invariant vector elds, projections
and trivialization map g(m)) that are available for any group g and its subgroup h
provided in (a.2) c b
a = 0. if we have two subgroups h  l  g, then three factor-
spaces arise: g/h, g/l and l/h. it can be shown in general case that covariant
derivatives in space g/h can be expressed in terms of derivatives in space l/h,
vector elds in l, projection  : l  l/h and trivialization l : l/h  l. for short,
we do not consider this in detail. in subsection 3.a, we nd these expressions for g/h
covariant derivatives in particular case g = osp(1|4), l = sl(2, c), h = su(2) from
the requirement that they satisfy the proper algebra. all the necessary geometrical
objects constructed from vector elds, projection and trivialization in this case reduce
to the small vielbeins (3.13), their tensor products and derivatives.

appendix b. the supertensor notation.
given a basis in a nite-dimensional supervector space h, a supervector is charac-
terized by a set of components , with the grassmann parity being assigned by the
rule () = ()  , where () = 0, 1 mod 2 is the grading function of this basis.
equivalently, one has

an invariant contraction, therefore, takes the form

(b.7)

to perform a covariant contraction (i.e., a contraction with a supertensor result)
over one upper and one lower index one have to transfer them to each other by
indices permutation and multiply the whole expression by the corresponding sign
factor according to the eq.(b.1) and then contract them by the rule (b.5). for
example, one can make the contractions like

(b.8)

two nonzero tensors may be equal only if their indices orders are equivalent. since
we will work with tensor expressions in the main text, the indices order in the right
hand side of some equation is unambiguously determined by the one of the left hand
side. with this in mind we equivalently represent the formulas like (b.7) as follows

d

 [=] (g1) 

g



d 



(b.9)

the notation [=] means that each term in the right hand side should be multiplied
by a sign factor arising when the indices to be contracted are transferred to their
partners and the rest indices are put to the same order as in the left hand side. its
easy to see that this prescription determines the sign factors unambiguously.

the supersymmetrization and superantisymmetrization are dened standardly as

follows,

the generalization to the multiple number of indices is straightforward. we also
employ the condensed notation a(n) and b[n] for supersymmetric ands superan-
tisymmetric tensors of rank n.

the standard notation

()(k)(l)  ()[k][l]  ()(1+2+...ek)(1+2+...ml)

(b.11)

is assumed.

in the main text, one meets the supertensors transforming in the tensor products
of two nonequivalent representations. all the rules of this appendix are assumed to
be employed, the only point is that the signs factors arising from a permutation of
nonequivalent indices should be also taken into account.

appendix c. the a(1|0) superalgebra and properties of its nite
dimensional representations.
the a(1|0) superalgebra is dened via the following graded commutation relations:

[sa(2), sb(2)] = 2absab

[sa(2), db] = abda

[t, da] =  1

2 da

[d+a, db] = sab + abt ; sab = sba

(c.1)

the other commutators vanish. among the real forms of this superalgebra is su(2, 0|1, 0)
superalgebra with the even part being isomorphic to su(2)  so(2), this real form is
explored in the main text.
the irreducible nite dimensional representations (fdrs) of a(1|0) were classied
by tierry-mieg [15]. for our purposes it is useful, however, to develop an independent
treatment, including non completely reducible fdrs. we do not pursue an exhaustive
classication and just describe the fdrs relevant for the constructions of the paper
and their close relatives, along with the information appropriate for our exposition in
the main text.

first, lets nd the representations with smallest dimensions. since the even gen-
erators of a(1|0) are expressed via the odd ones (see eq.(c.1)), a fdr is trivial if the
odd generators act trivially. therefore, there are no nontrivial (1|0), (0|1), (1|1) repre-
sentations. for the dimension (1|2), one nds exactly two inequivalent fdrs: (1|2)  
and (1|2)  , they are both irreducible. we denote the elements of corresponding
supervector spaces by  and  . the decomposition of ,   representations w.r.t.
even subalgebra su(2)  so(2) and the action of the odd generators in such a basis
looks as follows

here the pluses and minuses label the t -weights, namely,

t a =

1
2

a ; t  = 

it is easy to see by direct analysis of commutation relations (c.1) that these t -weights
combinations are the only ones allowing to construct a nontrivial (1|2) dimensional

38

a(1|0) representation. in what follows, we adopt a simpler notation for the indices
running the fdrs basis:  = (z, a);  = (z, a), where z, z label one-dimensional even
subspaces.

two representations,  and , are conjugated in the sense that they are mapped

to each other by an outer a(1|0)-automorphism of the form
a = da

ab = sab , d

t  = t , s

(c.5)

as a consequence, there exist the second rank invariant tensors c and c (see app.
b for our supertensor notation):

c =  ab 0

moreover, these invariant supermatrices enable one to obtain tensor form of expres-
sions (c.2c.4) for the action of the generators of a(1|0) on  and :

e = c + c ,
e

[=] (c + c).

to discuss tensor products of , , its worth working out (2|2) dimensional repre-
sentations. obviously, their decomposition w.r.t. even subalgebra should contain
two su(2) scalars in the even sector and one spinor in the odd sector, assigned with
corresponding t -weights (otherwise the (2|2) is a direct sum of fdrs with lower di-
mensions).
direct analysis of commutation relations (c.1) shows that there is the unique
series of (2|2) fdrs, which we denote (2|2)p, parametrized by a complex number p  c.

the (2|2)p fdrs are irreducible for any p except the values p = 1. in those cases, the

(2|2)1 = (1|0)   with invariant subspaces carrying the (1|2) dimensional fdrs and
the trivial representation being realized in the factor space.
obviously, the t -weights structure appearing in the decomposition (c.10) is the
only possible one for (2|2) dimensional fdrs. the representations (2|2)p exhaust all
(2|2) fdrs in the case p 6= 1.
in the last two cases. one nds two additional
representations contragredient to i1 and i1 : i1 and i1. their structure is as follows:

further, let us show that the supersymmetric tensor product of n, (n 6= 1) 
representations is isomorphic to (2|2)2n1 and analogously for  (the round brackets

indeed, consider tensor (1...n). its independent nonzero components are

z,z,...,z  2n
a,z,...,z  2n1 a
a,b,z,...,z  ab2n2

(c.17)

as the component content of (1...n) is identical to that of (2|2)2n1 and there is
no another (2|2) dimensional representation with such t -weight structure, these rep-
resentations are isomorphic. of course, this assertion may be proved by explicit
calculation either.

the next important fact we would like to deliver deals with the supersymmetrized

product of two (2|2)p fdrs.

((2|2)p  (2|2)p) = (2|2)2p1  (2|2)2p+1 , p 6= 0

(c.18)

it is proved by direct calculation, so we do not dwell on detailes here. making use
the eq.(c.16), one can rewrite (c.18) in the case p  z+ in the manner (the external
round brackets in the l.h.s. stand for the supersymmetrization w.r.t. two groups of
indices,  and , and not the complete supersymmetrization over all indices)

((1 . . . n)  (1 . . . n)) = (1 . . . 2n1)  (1 . . . 2n) ; n 6= 1.

(c.19)

equivalently, given two supersymmetric rank-n tensors, their sypersymmetric tensor
product is decomposed as follows

1...n1...n  ()(n)(n)1...n1...n =

= (1...n1...n) + c1...n;1...n

1...2n12n1...1; n 6= 1.

(c.20)

we see that there exist two subspaces in the supersymmetrized product of two syper-
symmetric tensors: one is the complete supersymmetrization over all indices, and
(1 . . . 2n1) is something new. moreover, we see that there exists an invariant 4n1-
rank tensor c(n);(n)

(2n1).

it follows from (c.18) that c(n);(n)

(2n1) has the properties

c(n);(n)

(2n1) = ()(n)(n) c(n);(n)
c1...(;1....n)

(2n1) = 0

(2n1)

c c1...n;1...n1;2...2n1 = 0

(c.21)

(c(n);(n)

(2n1)) = (n) + (n) + (2n  1) = 0.

obviously, the higher rank c-tensors may be expressed via the lower rank ones in

the manner

c(n+1);(n+1)

(2(n+1)1)[=]c(n);(n)

(2n1)



.

(c.22)

the lowest rank tensor in this sequence is c(12);(12);(123) . explicitly, it has

the components

cab ; cd ; z e f = abcdef

cab ; cz ; z z f = abcf

caz ; bz ; z z z = ab

cab ; zz ; z z z = 2ab

(c.23)

and those obtained from (c.23) by indices permutations, the other components equal
zero. the invariance of tensor (c.23) is checked by direct calculation.

introduce the next important tensor c[12];[12];(123) which is superantisymmetric

in the rst two index pairs and supersymmetric in the last three-index group:

(c.24)

(c.25)

c[12];[12];(123) = ()(1+2)1c11;22;(123)
()12+(1+2)1c12;12;(123).

the inverse transformation reads

c(12);(12);(123) =  1
+ ()12+(1+2)1 c[12];[12];(123)(cid:17)

3 (cid:16)()(1+2)1 c[11];[22];(123) +

the c tensor is also supersymmetric w.r.t. permutation of two rst groups of indices,
and traceless:

c[12];[12];(123) = ()(1+2)(1+2) c[12];[12];(123)

and satises the property

c  c[12];[1];(23) = 0,

c1[1;23];(123) = 0,

the component content of the c tensor is

cab ; cd ; z e f = (cabd + cbad)ef

cab ; cz ; z z f = cabf + cbaf

caz ; bz ; z z z = ab

cab;zz;zz z = 0

(c.26)

(c.27)

(c.28)

the formulas (c.21, c.26 c.27) just indicate that, for c and c, two rst groups of
indices are characterized by the young tableaux of the form

42

the completely analogous formulas take place for conjugated representations,
therefore, we also have the conjugated tensors c(1 2);(1 2);(123), c [ 1 2];[1 2];(123),
just with indices  being substituted for . in what follows, we will not write the bar
over the c-letters as it is clear from the index structure which tensor is used.

the tensor c is relevant for the component description of the equality

([2]  [2]) = [4]  (3),

(c.29)

which is proved by direct analysis. we see that there are two irreducible subspaces in
the supersymmetric tensor product of two second rank superantisymmetric tensors:
the rst is obtained by complete superantisymmetrization over all indices, the second
one is extracted with the c help by the rule

r(3) =(cid:16)f [2 1]g[ 2 1]  () [2][2]g[ 2 1]f [2 1](cid:17) c 1 2;1 2;(3).

(c.30)

the last formula plays an important role in the main text (see eqs.(6.16)).

let us eventually describe the structure of fdrs ip = (p)  (p). the cases p = 1

and p 6= 1 are dierent. for p = 1, one nds

  =



  (1|0)

(c.31)



  stands for the traceless part of   fdr  the adjoint fdr of a(1|0) (see
where
eq.(1.29)), and (1|0) is the trivial fdr. this assertion is easy to prove as every element
of the   fdr possesses the unique decomposition

 [=]



  c 


 ;





 = 0.

(c.32)

it appears that all ip, p  2 are isomorphic: p  2 ip = f and have the structure

f = (1|0)     



 !  (1|0)

lets prove this statement. exhibit the component content of the (2)(2) supertensor:

(c.33)

(c.34)

(2)(2) =n, , , +a, a, +a, a, 2, 2, a(2)o

the isomorphism ip = f p 6= 1 is established easily: one observes that dimensions
of all ip fdrs are (8|8) and equal to each other, on the other hand, there exist an
invariant map ip+1 on ip which may be written in tensor notation as follows:

(p)(p) = c

(p) (p).

(c.35)

so we may take p = 2 without the loss of generality and represent a general element
of f representation space by (2)(2). there exist the invariant subspace of double-
traceless tensors:

h 7|8 : {(2)(2)  h 7|8|

 = 0}

(c.36)

43

the factor space f/h 7|8 carries (1|0) dimensional (trivial) fdr, so one observes that
f = (1|0)  h 7|8.
further, there exist the invariant subspace (the [=] symbol stands for the ordi-
nary equality with an account of a sign factor, see app.b)

h 1|0  h 7|8 : {(2)(2)  h 1|0|

[=] cc}

(c.37)

the inclusion h 1|0  h 7|8 is clear as the double-c  trace in h 1|0 is proportional to
the supertrace of the identity operator in the f space, which is equal zero as f is
(8|8)-dimensioinal. therefore, one gets the structure h 7|8 = (6|8)  h 1|0, where
(6|8) is some (6|8)-dimensional fdr. consider two subspaces:

htrace  h 7|8 : {(2)(2)  htrace|

[=] c ;   h 7|8}

htraceless  h 7|8 : {(2)(2)  htraceless|



 = 0}

these two subspaces, htrace and htraceless, overlap only via the h 1|0 since

(2)(2)  htrace   = c,

  (2)(2)  h 1|0
it is easy to see that the component form of htrace and htraceless is

(2)(2)  htraceless   = c

htrace = n, , +a, a, a(2)o
htraceless = {, , +a, a, 2, 2,}

(c.38)

(c.39)

(c.40)

and their dimensions are (5|4) and (3|4), correspondingly. as they have (1|0)-dimensional
overlap (parametrized by  in the last formula), one has h 7|8 = htrace + htraceless
and h 7|8/h 1|0 = (htrace/h 1|0)  (htraceless/h 1|0) in the factor space. the repre-
  (1|0) (see eqs.(c.31, c.32))
sentation htrace/h 1|0 is isomorphic to
while htraceless/h 1|0 is some (2|4)-dimensional fdr with component content exhibited
by s in the formula (c.40). obviously, it is decomposed into direct sum of two
(1|2)-fdrs with components {+a, 2} and {a, 2}, which are identied with two
unique representations with such dimension (see eq.(c.2)) : htraceless/h 1|0 =   .
therefore, we come to the overall result of our analysis in the form of the eq.(c.33).
the fact that the decomposition (c.33) is not a direct sum is checked by explicit com-
ponent calculation.


  as   =



lets make a few remarks.
one may wonder about the explicit tensor form of the htraceless subspace. it is

easy to prove that every element of htraceless may be written in the form

(2)(2)

[=] c(2);(2);(2) (2) + c(2);(2);(2)  (2)

(c.41)

44

the invariant seven-rank c-tensors play an essential role here. the last formula
presents a general solution to the tracelessness constraint, with the rst and the
second terms in the r.h.s. parametrizing the preimages (w.r.t. factorization by h 1|0)
of  and  fdrs, h  and h, correspondingly.

one may impose another constraint in h 7|8:

(c.42)

(c.43)

(c.44)

0 [=] c(2);

(2)

(2)(2)(2)
;

its now easy to derive that its general solution is

(2)(2)  h + htrace.

quite analogously,

(2)

;

0 [=] c(2);

(2)(2)(2) 
 (2)(2)  h  + htrace.

the joint eect of constraints (c.42) and (c.44) is htrace subspace.
