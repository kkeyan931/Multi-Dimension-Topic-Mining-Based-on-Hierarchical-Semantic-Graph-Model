(for d-branes need variant principle, namely need called plane foliations shall elaborate point here). one way thinking principle analogous past histories approach quantum mechanics. clearly quantum level one integrate foliations given codim. piece warning here: principle imply physical process branes described foliations. although group foliations huge, fact comparable size group local dieo- morphisms , foliations really nasty, would like make strong statement. denitely true though physical process indeed described foliations, hence least condition must satised them. note: going furter, would like make one crucial remark: principle puts severe restrictions topology underlying man- ifold may have, case m-theory 11-manifold. also important manifold open closed. may help, hope, compactication problem string theory even m-theory, namely go d=10 (or d=11) d=4 intuitive di- mension spacetime. shall address question next section. nal comment this: principle puts absolutely restriction usual quantum eld theory point particles d=4, e.g. electroweak theory qcd. case spacetime r4 non compact 0-branes (point particles) consequently 1-dim foliations integrability condition trivially satised (essentially due deep result gromov foliations open manifolds, states open manifolds admit codim 1 foliations; striking contrast, closed manifolds admit codim 1 foliations euler characteristic zero, see example ,
