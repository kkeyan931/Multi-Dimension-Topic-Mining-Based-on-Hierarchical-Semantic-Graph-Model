(5), connected form factor obtained principle using crossing formula non coinciding arguments, getting rid diverging ill dened terms arguments sent one another. key point values connected form-factors understood generally follows (this argument quite similar balogs construction ). start, need make remarks normalization states. consider scalar product h|i, which, formally, equal 2(0), since normalization used construction asymptotic states h|i = 2( ). course symbol (0) make much sense, regularized properly. way consider completude relation, 1 = r 2|ih|. relation hides cancellation two terms, meaning easier see introducing nite length l system. first, state |i actually normalized, (0) term mentioned before; similarly associated bra. integral therefore involve instead ket |ih|i second, allowed rapidities particle uniformly distributed; rather, density given 2p = ml cosh , completude relation involve therefore integral r p ()d. completude relation equivalent one used far, preserves scalar product states, thus need  h|i = ml cosh . 3 (6) argument generalized case several rapidities. two particles, bethe equations read: 2n1 =ml sinh 1 + 2n2 =ml sinh 2 + 1 1 ln s(1 2) ln s(2 1). this, deduce ml cosh 1 + (12) (12) h2, 1|1, 2i =det (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (12) ml cosh 2 + (12) =m2l2 cosh 1 cosh 2 + ml(12)(cosh 1 + cosh 2). (7) (8) formula generalizes arbitrary number rapidities. could expected, coincides well known formula norm bethe states derived gaudin korepin context xxz models (see ). get back (4) (5). clear rst term expansions match, due (6) h|o(x)|i h|o(x)|iconn = o()m cosh . two particle form factor, let dene: h2, 1|o(x)|1, 2iconn =h2, 1|o(x)|1, 2i h2|o(x)|2iconnh1|1i h1|o(x)|1iconnh2|2i. (9) (10) here, scalar products (eg h1|1i) computed presence particle (2), something left implicit notations simplicity. general arguments explained previously, h1|1i = ml cosh 1 + (12). thus follows h2, 1|o(x)|1, 2iconn = m(12)  , (11) ensuring matching (4) (5). general formula connected form- factors follows easily extending (10) n = 2 arbitrary values n: simply subtract initial form factor possible contractions, careful evaluate scalar products states presence particles - expressed various minors initial determinant. net result simply: hn, . . . , 1|o(x)|1, . . . , niconn = m(12)(23) . . . (n1,n) cosh 1o(n)+ permutations, (12) 4 clearly ensures coincidence (4) (5). course pretending argument proof (5), believe could suciently strenghtened, maybe along lines . stands, certainly gives support (5), claim guess {$9902075$} considered general thermodynamic ensembles. shall argue that, unfortunately, formula proposed {$9902075$} two particle correlator probably correct. rather give general arguments, present simple counterexample, case = 0 non trivial chemical potential. consider indeed free boson hamiltonian h = 1 2 z (cid:20)8g2 + 1 8g (x)2(cid:21) dx.

(15) expressions form-factors operator z well known: can, principle, directly compute connected ones, show agreement general formula (12). instance, two particle form-factor gives h|z|i = 2e, (16) agreement (the massless limit of) (9) o() = 2, value integral z soliton. form-factor (11) simple values coupling g. checked similarly formula connected four particle turn two point function operator z, show expression proposed {$9902075$} time work. recall proposal {$9902075$}: ho(x, y)o(0, 0)ir = (hoir)2 + xn=1 1 n ! xi=1z d1 2 . . . dn 2 n yj=1 fj (j) (17) exp(cid:16)ij(xkj + iyej)(cid:17)|h0|o(0)|1, . . . , ni1,...,n|2 . here, f+ = 1 momentum. finally, 1+e , e = r dressed excitation energy, p dressed excitation h0|o(0)|1, . . . , ni1,...,n h0|o(0)|1 i(1 1)/2, . . . , n i(n 1)/2i physical meaning (17) transparent formula. correlations temper- ature determined processes involving excitations thermal ground 6 state, dressed energy momentum . excitations two types, particles holes (the variable (17)). sum (17) thus expected; key proposal {$9902075$} form factors physical excitations bare ones. case consider, situation simplies considerably. first, let recall structure excitations . conveniently represented following table: holes : h +(), solitons : +(), antisolitons : () (1 g)v, arbitrary breathers : n() ngv, arbitrary (18) excitation energies non trivial expansions given . physical processes involved two point function z three basic types: creation pair particle hole (ie take soliton fermi sea move outside); creation pair soliton (above fermi sea) antisoliton, creation breather. latter two processes thresholds. since quantities e p singularity, bare form-factors know anything thresholds, immediately quite obvious proposal {$9902075$} cannot true: would lead singularities fourier spectrum correlator, sharp contrast result expected (14). first, let show formula fact right free case g = 1 nevertheless, probably reasonable make counter example explicit. 2 . case, things simplify several reasons: breathers, excitation energies simple expressions h 2 , two particle form factor z non zero, h0|z|12i = 2ie1/2e2/2. connected term expression (17) reads 2 e, + = e v 2 , = e + v + = v d2 d1 z +z = 2 z 2e1/2e2/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 z 2ie1/2e2/2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) z2 (cid:2)1 exp(eaz)(cid:3) 1 d2 2 eiz(e2 e1 ) 2 eiz(e1 +e2 ) 1 z2 exp(eaz) = 1 z2 expected result (14) g = 1 2 . general case, consider fourier transform two point function, 2 eixhz(x, y)z(0)iy0 = 2g ( > 0). also restrict case s() = r dx 7 low frequencies (that is, smaller thresholds), particle hole processes contribute; formula (17) fails case, enough show correct. lowest thresholds, s(), according formula (17), given sum terms sn corresponding processes n particles n holes. v = 0 know formula (17) correct, sns linear , sn = cn. case, thresholds, sn supplemented terms corresponding processes, also proportional . innite sum terms reproduces desired behaviour s() = 2g; checked {$9902075$} convergence sum fact quick g close 1. v 6= 0, formula (17) predicts correctly (this simply follows dimensional analysis) sns form sn = fn(cid:0) nite v : v (cid:1), cn = fn(). let us consider limit small frequencies case, instead exploring behaviour functions fn limit small argument. since contribution frequency determined rapidities > holes < particles = n xi=1 h +(i) + n xi=1 +( i), (19) clearly, small , particles holes closer closer fermi rapidity. two particle contribution instance, reads general z d1 2 z 1 2 |h 1|z|1i|2 (cid:2) h +(1) +( 1)(cid:3) | +(a) h 1 (2)2|haz|ai|2 becomes limit small , fact, limit lim0 respect rapidity variable). +(a)| (dots denote derivatives s() , two particle contribution one consider. two reasons that: one next contribution 2 term due phase space considerations; limit 0, rapidities n particles n holes compressed towards a, form-factors like eg ha, a|z|a, ai vanish due general behaviour rapidity exchanges (s(0) = 1). follows that, according {$9902075$}, one would nd lim 0 s() || =?= 1 (2)2 |ha||ai|2 | +(a)|| h +(a)| . 8 (20) right hand side evaluated using detailed results  lling ground state etc. one nds (for dimensional reasons, pure, v independent number) rhs = 1 2 g 12g 1g (cid:19)2 1 g (cid:18)  .
