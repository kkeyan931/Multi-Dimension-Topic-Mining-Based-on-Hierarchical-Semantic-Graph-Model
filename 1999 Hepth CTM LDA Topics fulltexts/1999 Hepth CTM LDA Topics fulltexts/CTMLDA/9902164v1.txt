abstract

in the framework of the osp(1, 2)-symmetric quantization of irreducible massive
gauge theories the background eld method is studied for the simplest case of a
linear splitting of the gauge eld into a background conguration ai and the quan-
tum uctuations qi. the entire set of symmetries of that approach, including three
types of backgrounddependent gauge transformations, is expressed by the corre-
sponding set of ward identities. making use of these identities, together with the
equation of motion of the auxiliary eld, the background dependence of the generat-
ing functionals of the 1pi vertex functions and the greens functions is completely
determined by the dependence of these functionals upon the gauge elds and the
associated antields. it is proven that the introduction of a background eld does
not change the ultraviolet asymptotics of the theory.

1 introduction

lagrangian quantization of general gauge theories is usually considered in the batalin
vilkovisky(bv) approach [1, 2] as well as in the sp(2)covariant formalism of batalin,
lavrov and tyutin [3, 4] which is a generalization of the former observing the extended
brstsymmetry, the symmetry under brst and antibrsttransformations. these
very general quantization procedures may be applied also to gauge theories with external
elds and/or composite elds [5]; a review of that extension within the bv approach has
been given in ref. [6]. however, there is a wide class of physically interesting situations
where these procedures seem not to be optimally adapted. this is the case if quantum
eects of gauge elds in the presence of classical gauge congurations, like instantons
or monopoles, have to be evaluated or, more simply, if the background eld method
(bfm) should be applied in order to facilitate explicit computations. the bfm is also

very convenient for the investigation of general properties of gauge theories and therefore
deserves a comprehensive study.

the background eld method [7] has many attractive features. first of all it is possible,
by chosing a background covariant gauge, to compute quantum eects without losing
manifest gauge invariance. this is intensively used in analyses of gravity and supergravity,
in the construction of eective eld theories [8] as well as for the introduction of gauge
invariant eective actions [9]. the bfm also has been used in studies of gauge theories
with external elds, e.g., with external gravity [10]. in its original formulation the bfm
takes prot from the fact that making a linear splitting of the gauge eld into quantum
uctuations around a classical background eld the gauge transformation of the latter
may be chosen inhomogeneous such that the gauge transformations of the quantum eld
occure homogeneous like those of the (anti)ghost and the matter elds. (in principle, also
(anti)ghost and matter elds could be decomposed in that manner but without changing
the transformation properties of their splitting partners.)

concerning the proof of renormalizability of gauge theories within the brst approach
and using the bfm an essential step has been made by kluberg-stern and zuber [11] dis-
tinguishing between typei and brsttransformations (which have been called by them
typeii transformations). their procedure has been applied, e.g., for the study of the
yangmillsdirac theory in the instanton sector [12]. this problem has been reanalysed
recently by using the extended brst symmetry together with additional symmetries lead-
ing to an osp(1, 2)symmetric formalism [13]. thereby, the severe infrared problems of
gauge theories  either with or without background congurations  required the consider-
ation, at least intermediately, of massive gauge elds. using that procedure we considered
the curciferrari model in delbourgojarvis gauge [14]. within the osp(1, 2)symmetric
formalism it was also possible to give a general solution of a problem which has been
posed by rouet [15] but solved by him only for the physical greens functions: there
exists a relationship between the greens functions with a generic background eld and
without them (this holds also for the instanton background [13]). as has been shown
recently, our approach is a special case of the sp(2)covariant formalism when the latter
is restricted by extending the symmetry requirements from symplectic to orthosymplectic
covariance. this led to an osp(1, 2)covariant formalism [16] and the introduction of a
further antield. despite of this enlargement of the space of antields we may speek of
the following inclusion of the related quantization procedures with respect to the required
symmetry properties: bv quantization  sp(2)quantization  osp(1, 2)quantization.

in the following, extending our earlier results [16], we present the general aspects of
the bfm in the osp(1, 2)covariant quantization scheme.
(a short exposition already
has been given in ref. [17]). in order to simplify the complexity of the formalism, and
because the addition of matter elds does not lead to serious troubles, we restrict ourselfes
to the consideration of yangmills theories with semisimple lie group in 4dimensional
spacetime. however, the method has a somewhat wider range of application. let us
therefore specify our setup by relating it to the realm of general gauge theories. thereby,
we use the condensed notation introduced by dewitt [6] and conventions concerning the
derivatives with respect to elds and antields adopted in ref. [3]. however, for later
notational simplicity all the antields are introduced with opposite sign in comparison
with ref. [1, 2, 3, 4, 16]!

we consider a set of gauge elds gi which, for the sake of simplicity, are supposed to

2

be bosonic and whose classical action scl(g) is invariant under the gauge transformations

gi = ri

(g),

ri

(g)scl,i(g) = 0

with

scl,i(g) 


gi scl(g),

(1.1)

where  and ri
(g) are the parameters of the gauge transformations and the gauge
generators, respectively. we assume the set of generators ri
(g) to be linearly independent
and complete (irreducible or zerostage theories). furthermore, to be able to introduce
the background eld ai by a linear quantumbackground splitting of the gauge elds,
gi = ai + qi, we make the assumption that ri

(g) depends on gi only linearly,

ri

(g) = ri

(0) + ri

,jgj,

ri

(0)  ri

 ,

(1.2)

and, for the sake of renormalizability, that ri
(0) are linear dierential operators. (notice,
that supersymmetric theories in general do not obey this restriction but that the majority
of physically interesting theories, including, e.g., n = 2 super yangmills theories in
harmonic superspace, comply it.) the closedness of the gauge algebra is expressed by

ri

,jrj

(g)  ri

,jrj

(g) = ri

(g)f 

,

(1.3)

where f 
 are the structure functions. if the gauge symmetry is determined by a semi-
simple lie group, they are constant, obey the usual jacobi identity and, by the help
of the (nonsingular) killing metric g  f 
, may be chosen totally
antisymmetric after lowering all the indices,

, gg = 

f 

f  gf 

 = gf 

 = gf 

.

(1.4)

furthermore, introducing the metric tensor with respect to the eld components, gij, with
gijgjk = k

i , the following relations, being completely analogous to (1.4), hold:

gkiri

,j = gjiri

,k,

gikrj

,i = gijrk

,i;

(1.5)

of course, they are compatible with the gauge algebra (1.3) (observe that according to
dewitts notation i = (, , x, . . . ) summarizes lorentz and group indices, space-time
points, etc.). of course, instead of assuming the gauge algebra to result from a (semi
simple) lie group we could require only the properties (1.2), (1.4) and (1.5) to be satised.
now we point to the fact that, because of the linear quantumbackground splitting the
symmetry transformations (1.1) of scl(a + q) can be realized in three dierent ways: as
background or typei gauge transformations [11], and two forms of gauge transformations
of the quantum eld, one with ai held xed (called typeii) and another one with ai
transforming homogenously (called typeiii):

typei :

typeii :

typeiii :

ai = ri
ai = 0,
ai = ri

(a),

,jaj,

qi = ri
qi = ri
qi = ri

,jqj,
(a + q),
(q).

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

notice that all these symmetries are written down with the parameters  of the gauge
transformations. to our knowledge, neither typeii nor typeiii symmetry have been
considered in the literature as quantum symmetries; however, this is possible if the theory
is appropriately extended as will be done here! thereby, in order to remove the gauge

3

degeneracy of the classical action scl(a + q), one should choose the gauge xing term
in such a way that the invariance under typeii and typeiii transformations is xed
whereas its invariance under typei transformations, i.e., under a gauge change of the
classical background, is not to be aected.

ia, b

ia = (q

in the sp(2)covariant lagrangian quantization [3] the eective (gauge xed) action
se(a|) with i = (qi, b, c b) denoting the (quantum part of the) gauge eld, the aux-
iliary eld and the (anti)ghost elds, respectively, is invariant under properly generalized
typei and (anti)brsttransformations. introducing for each eld i two additional sets
a, )
of antields 
is required to obey the quantum master equations of the (anti)brstsymmetry together
with the typei ward identity, both being properly extended to the additional antields.
if this approach is generalized to the osp(1, 2)symmetric lagrangian quantization
[16] the corresponding gauge xed action sm,e(a|) additionally depends on a mass
parameter m and is required to be osp(1, 2) as well as typei invariant; the extended
a, , ) is required to satisfy the quantum master equations of both
action sm,ext(a|, 
the (anti)brst and sp(2)symmetry. thereby, in comparison with the sp(2)approach,
an additional source i = (di, e, fb) has to be included in order to full the osp(1, 2)
superalgebra for m 6= 0 (for basic denitions see section ii below).

whereas the requirement of gauge covariance with respect to ai, i.e., typei symmetry,
is completely independent of the master equations, i.e., on the postulated (anti)brst
symmetries, the typeii and typeiii ward identities are related to the master equations,
i.e., they are consistency conditions of the theory. indeed, both identities can be derived
from the quantum master equations by imposing the equations of motion for the auxiliary
a, , ) is constructed in
elds b and the (anti)ghosts c b. even more, if sm,ext(a|, 
such a way that for ai 6= 0 the typei and for ai = 0 the typeii (or typeiii) ward
identity is satised, then its aidependence is completely determined by these symmetry
requirements! using this the vertex functional of massive irreducible gauge theories with
a, , ), can be related to the vertex functional without
background eld ai, m(a|, 
background eld,

m(a|, 

a, , ) = om(a|/, / )  m(0|, 

a, , ),

by a well dened operation om(a|/, / ). an analogous relation holds for the gener-
a, , ) where ji = (ji, k, lb). further-
ating functional of greens functions zm(a|j, 
more, it has been proven that the introduction of a background gauge does not change
the ultraviolet asymptotics of the theory. this is by no means a trivial result since
a, , ) in general depends nonlinear on the antields and, therefore, the an-
sm,ext(a|, 
tields never more may be interpreted as sources of the (anti)brst transforms of the
corresponding elds.

the paper is organized as follows. in section ii the osp(1, 2)symmetric lagrangian
quantization is shortly reviewed. in section iii it is shown how, starting from a proper
solution of the quantum master equations, by generalized canonical transformations any
admissible solution of the master equations may be obtained. section iv is devoted to
the construction of a proper solution of the classical master equations in the presence
of generic background elds. this solution w (0)
a, , ), which is obtained by
assuming that it depends only linearly on the antields, after choosing a gauge obeys all
the symmetry requirements of the classical theory scl(a + q) we started from. in section
v, again making use of generalized canonical transformations, the general solution of the

m,ext(a|, 

4

m,ext(a|, 

classical master equations, s(0)
a, , ), depending nonlinear on the antields, will
be obtained. it is also shown that this solution is stable against small perturbations and,
imposing the equations of motion of the auxiliary eld b, that it depends on three in-
dependent zfactors only. in section vi the ward identities for the generating functional
a, , ) of the oneparticleirreducible (1pi) vertex functions are derived. be-
m(a|, 
sides the generalizations of the slavnovtaylor and the delducsorella identities we derive
the kluberg-sternzuber and the lee identity which are related to typei and typeii
symmetry, respectively. in section vii, combining both the last two identities, the ai
a, , ) is determined. in addition, the ward identity related to
dependence of m(a|, 
a, , ) is shown to be typeiii invariant. as
typeiii symmetry is derived and m(a|, 
an application rouets result [15] concerning physical greens functions is proven indepen-
a, , ) is
dently. finally, in section viii the renormalization group equation for m(a|, 
derived and a rigorous proof is given that the function and the anomalous dimensions
are independent of the background also in this very general setting.

2 osp(1,2)covariant quantization

ia, b 

a, c 

now we shortly review the osp(1, 2)symmetric quantization procedure [16]. let us start
with the widely known sp(2)covariant formalism [3]. it is characterized by introducing to
each eld i = (qi, b, c b) with grassmann parity (i)  i, three kinds of antields,
ia) = i + 1 and i = ( qi, b, cb), ( i) = i . here 

ia = (q
ia
correspond to (the negative of) the sources of the (anti)brst- transforms, sai, while
i corresponds to the (negative of the) source of their combined transforms, absbsai;
the index a = 1, 2 labels the sp(2)doublets of the (anti)brstoperators sa as well as of
the (anti)ghosts elds. raising and lowering of sp(2)indices is obtained by the invariant
antisymmetric tensor

in the sp(2)approach a doublet of odd graded symplectic structures, the extended

antibrackets (f, g)a, is introduced by

(f, g)a =

and v a = ab

(2.2)

(here, we remind the reader being familiar with the sp(2)approach that according to
our changement in the denition of the antields a minus sign appears in the denition of
a above; the same occurs at various other places). let us remark that the odd graded
antibrackets may be dened alternatively by the leibniz rule for a according to

a(f g) = (af )g + (1)(f )(cid:0)(f, g)a + f (ag)(cid:1).

the relative nilpotency of the (anti)brstoperators, {sa, sb} = 0, repeats itself in the
important relations { a, b} = 0.

5

the quantum action s(, 

a, ) is required to satisfy the quantum master equations:

1

2 (s, s)a  v as = ias



aexp{(i/)s} = 0

(2.3)

with the boundary condition s|
a= ==0 = scl(q). of course, the solution of the master
equations is not unique. analogous to the case of the bvapproach [2] two proper solu-
tions of (2.3) are related by a generalized canonical transformation with an appropriate
generating functional [4]. therefore, the degeneracy of the action s may be removed
by choosing a suciently general gaugexing bosonic functional f (), thus dening the
extended action sext(, 

a, ) which by construction also satises eq. (2.3):

exp{(i/)sext} = exp{i t (f )} exp{(i/)s} with

t (f ) = 1

2ab{ b, [ a, f ]}.

(2.4)

this formalism despite appearing manifest sp(2)symmetric leads to solutions of the
quantum master equations which also may be sp(2)nonsymmetric. the reason for this
can be traced back to the fact that the general transformation properties of the solutions of
(2.3) do not restrict f to be a sp(2)scalar. therefore, in order to ensure sp(2)symmetry
the extended quantum action has to be subjected to further requirements. in addition,
the formalism may be generalized to contain also massive gauge and (anti)ghost elds,
which are necessary at least intermediately in the bphzl renormalization procedure to
avoid unwanted infrared singularities. of course, then the (anti)brsttransformations,
and the operators a, must be extended to include also mass terms.

let us now state the essential modications of the sp(2)formalism leading to the
osp(1, 2)symmetric quantization of irreducible gauge theories with massive elds. first,
the linear part of the operators (2.2) has to be extended to observe the mdependence,

are the pauli matrices. obviously, as long as m 6= 0 the operators a

in the limit   0 from eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) the classical master equations are obtained.
from eqs. (2.13) and (2.15) it follows that, if and only if the action sm is sp(2)
invariant, it can be (anti)brstinvariant as well. moreover, in order to express the
algebra (2.11)  (2.13) by operator identities, and to decompose the set of antields into
linear spaces being irreducible under the osp(1, 2)superalgebra, one is forced to enlarge
the set of antields by additional sources i = (di, e, fb) with (i) = i .

in order remove the gauge arbitrariness, analogous to eq.

m, um(f )] exp{(i/)sm} = 0 and [ a, um(f )] exp{(i/)sm} = 0.
be shown to hold:
hence, because sm being a proper solution of the master equations, the extended action
sm,ext satises the quantum master equations (2.14) and (2.15) as well. a more detailed
discussion of these aspects is given in the next section.

3 generalized canonical transformations

as became obvious from the considerations of the last section there exists a whole set
of proper solutions of the master equations.
in the bvapproach a solution s of the
master equation is called proper if (a) it has a stationary point where the variations with
respect to the elds and the antields vanish and (b) its hessian with respect to the
elds and antields at that stationary point is nonsingular. it has been shown that two
proper solutions of the master equations are connected by a canonical transformation [2].
these notions have a natural generalization to the sp(2)covariant approach  where a
corresponding connection between two proper solutions already has been proven [4]  as
well as to the osp(1, 2)symmetric quantization procedure.

in this section we show how, starting from a proper solution of the quantum master
equations (2.14) and (2.15), by generalized canonical transformations (see eq. (3.12) be-
low) any admissible solution of the same equations may be obtained. the organization of
the proof  as well as the resulting solution  is quite similar to that presented in ref. [4].
thereby, it is very remarkable that there exists a formal extension of these results (up
to mass terms) to the case of osp(1, 2)symmetry. actually, we are only interested in
generalized canonical transformation of the classical master equations. however, in order
to get such a transformation we solve this problem quite generally, i.e., rst we study
transformations that allow one to consider the characteristic arbitrariness of a solution of
the quantum master equations. then, by taking the limit   0 we recover the transfor-
mation we are looking for. finally, we discuss how in this way the general solution of the
classical master equations may be obtained (the explicit construction of this solution will
be given in sections iv and v).

to begin with let us assume (a) that two proper solutions, sm(0) and sm(1), of the
quantum master equations are given and (b) that a path in the manifold of solutions
sm(), 0    1, i.e., an interpolating functional, exists which connects them. such a
functional, for every value of , is obliged to satisfy the generating equations

1
2(sm(), sm())a  i a

msm() = 0,

1
2{sm(), sm()}a  i asm() = 0.

(3.1)

dierentiating these equations with respect to , then for the derivation sm()/ one
gets the following consistency conditions:

qa

m()

sm()



= 0,

qa()

sm()



= 0;

(3.2)

here the operators qa
arbitrary functional x is dened according to

m() and qa() depend explicitly on sm() and their action on an

qa

m()x  (sm(), x)a  i a

mx,

qa()x  {sm(), x}a  i ax.

(3.3)

these operators, like a

m and a, are a realization of the osp(1, 2)superalgebra:

[qa(), qb()] =

(3.4)

in order to nd an explicit expression for the interpolating functional sm() subjected

to the consistency conditions (3.2) let us make for sm()/ the following ansatz:

sm()



= wm()y with

wm()  1

2 abqb

m()qa

m() + m2,

y = y (, 

a, , ) being an arbitrary local sp(2)symmetric functional, i.e.,

(a) i
j

y
i j + vay = 0.

(3.5)

(3.6)

now, taking into account the osp(1, 2)symmetry, eq. (3.4), by a straightforward, but

tedious direct computation one obtains

qa

m() wm() =  1

2 m2(a)a

bqb

m()qa(),

qa() wm() = wm()qa(),

(3.7)

and the consistency conditions (3.2) are fullled provided it holds

qa()y  (a) i

+

y

i(cid:16)sm()

j

+ j(cid:17)  i(1)i l

i

y

j(cid:27) = 0.

(3.8)

obviously, this equation has a solution which is given by

sm()

i

+ i = 0,

y
i

= 0,

(3.9)

where the rst of these equations is a nontrivial condition concerning the dependence
of sm() on i. however, it is a natural condition. this may be seen if eqs. (3.1) are
dierentiated with respect to i leading to the following requirements

qa

m()(cid:16)sm()

i

+ i(cid:17) = 0,

qa()(cid:16)sm()

i

+ i(cid:17) = 0.

(3.10)

a, )
therefore, we are forced to require that sm() is linear in i and that y = y (, 
is independent of i. then, as a consequence of the restrictions (3.9), the second of the
equations (3.1) simplies essentially,

(a) i
j

sm()
i j + vasm() = 0,

(3.11)

showing that, analogous to eq. (3.6), the interpolating functional is sp(2)symmetric.

now, we are left with the problem to integrate eq. (3.5). the solution of that dier-

ential equation is given by

um(y ) = exp{(/i) tm(y )} with

exp{(i/)sm()} = um(y )exp{(i/)sm(0)},
m, [ a

tm(y ) = 1

2ab{ b

(3.12)

m, y ]} + (i/)2m2y.

the proof is as follows. first, we rewrite the action of qa

m on an arbitrary functional x:

qa

m()x = exp{(i/)sm()}(/i)[ a

m, x] exp{(i/)sm()}.

10

with the help of this expression the dierential equation (3.5) obtains the following form:

sm()



= exp{(i/)sm()}n 1

2ab(/i)2{ b

m, [ a

m, y ]} + m2yoexp{(i/)sm()}.

using this result, and the denition of tm(y ), we obtain

 exp{(i/)sm()}



= exp{(i/)sm()}(i/)

sm()



= (/i) tm(y ) exp{(i/)sm()}.

because of  tm(y ) = tm(y ) this nishes the proof of eq. (3.12).

now, by virtue of

[ a

m, i


i

+ i] = 0,

[ a, i


i

+ i] = 0,

[y, i


i

+ i] = 0,

(3.13)

from (3.12) it follows that imposing condition (3.9) together with (3.6) for  = 0 is
sucient to ensure their validity also for the whole range 0 <   1. this proves
that sm(), as given by eq.
(3.12), is a solution of the quantum master equations,
i.e., it fullls the rst of the equations (3.1) as well as (3.11) for any .
in addition,
subsequently our ansatz (3.5) has been justied. obviously, performing a generalized
canonical transformation (3.12) of a proper solution sm(0) by an appropriately chosen
functional y appears as the general procedure of introducing a gauge (see eq. (2.17)).

if eq. (3.12) is solved iteratively one gets a series expansion of sm() in powers of :

sm() =

(0)
sm = sm(0),

this shows that if both sm(0) and y are local then sm() is a local functional as well.

next, if we are interested in a general solution of the classical master equations, which
will be the case in the next two sections, we only have to take the limit   0 in the
expansion (3.14). as a result we get a quite nontrivial transformation which converts a
proper solution sm(0) of the classical master equations into another solution sm(1) of the
same equations (for notational simplicity we do not distinguish them by an additional
index from solutions of the quantum master equations)

finally, we outline the steps how through the use of two special transformations of
this kind the general solution of the classical master equations may be obtained. let us
assume that a proper solution sm(0)  w (0)
m , being linear with respect to the antields,
has been constructed. then, a more general solution, being nonlinear with respect to the
antields, and denoted by sm(1)  s(0)

m , can be constructed by choosing

sm(0)  w (0)

m (linear),

y  g

=

sm(1) = s(0)

m (nonlinear),

(3.16)

where the most general ansatz for the functional g( ), which has mass dimension two in
four spacetime dimension, is uniquely given by g( )  gij i j . furthermore, using the
transformation (3.15) once more, the general solution, being denoted by sm(1) = s(0)
m,ext,
is obtained from the previous solution s(0)

m by choosing

sm(0)  s(0)

m (nonlinear),

y  f

=

sm(1) = s(0)

m,ext (nonlinear),

(3.17)

with a gaugexing functional f ()  gijij being the most general ansatz with respect
to the elds i. of course, the solution s(0)
m,ext could have been constructed also by
interchanging both steps above, i.e., there holds the following commutative diagram:

w (0)

m

y =g s(0)

m

y =fy

w (0)

m,ext 
y =g

y =f

y

s(0)
m,ext

(3.18)

thereby, the solution sm(1) = w (0)

m,ext is constructed from sm(0) = w (0)

m by choosing

sm(0)  w (0)

m (linear),

y  f

=

sm(1) = w (0)

m,ext (linear).

4 proper solution of classical master equations

the general problem of how to construct a solution of the quantum master equations in
the osp(1, 2)approach has been solved in ref. [16]. here we show how to proceed in the
case of a linear quantumbackground splitting of the gauge eld. the consecutive steps
are the following:

1. starting with the classical action scl(a + q), we rst construct a proper solution

w (0)

m (a|, 

a, , ) of the classical master equations,

1
2(w (0)

m , w (0)

m )a  v a

mw (0)

m = 0,

1
2 {w (0)

m , w (0)

m }a  vaw (0)

m = 0,

(4.1)

being linear in the antields.

2. in order to remove the gauge degeneracy of that solution w (0)

a, , ) a gauge
is introduced by an appropriate generating functional f () according to eq. (3.12) in
a, , ) being
the tree approximation. this denes the extended action w (0)
a solution of the classical master equations which, in addition, is invariant under
typei as well as (up to mass terms) under typeii and typeiii transformations.

m,ext(a|, 

m (a|, 

12

despite these nice properties, that solution can not be used for the construction of the
a, , ), since it is not stable under
generating functional of vertex functions, m(a|, 
small perturbations, i.e., not all of the counter terms which may occure in the process
of renormalization could be absorbed by redening the independent parameters of the
theory. this circumstance is due the fact that i and i mix under renormalization.
therefore, in the next section, we continue our programme by the following steps.

3. the proper solution w (0)

generalized to a solution of the classical master equations, s(0)
depends nonlinear on the antields 
(3.9), it must be linear in i).

a, , ) by the help of the extension (3.16) will be
a, , ), which
ia and i (however, because of the requirement

m (a|, 

m (a|, 

4. now, xing the gauge as before by the generating functional f () we arrive at
the most general solution of the classical master equations, s(0)
a, , ),
which will be the starting point for the solution of the quantum master equations,
i.e., the generalization to any order of perturbation theory. it may be shown that
s(0)
a, , ) depends on seven independent parameters and that it is invari-
m,ext(a|, 
ant (up to mass terms) under typei, typeii and typeiii transformations.

m,ext(a|, 

(a) construction of a proper solution
the symmetry operators of the action w (0)
m , the mextended (anti)brst operator and
the generators of symplectic transformations, will be denoted by sa
m (a = 1, 2) and da
(a = 0, +, ), respectively. they full the osp(1, 2)superalgebra in the following form:

[da, db] = abc dc,

[da, sa

m] = sb

m(a) a
b ,

{sa

m, sb

m} = m2(a)ab da.

in order to ensure the osp(1, 2)invariance of w (0)

m we make the following ansatz:

w (0)

m = scl(a + q)  ( 1

2absb

msa

m + m2)x with x = qiqi + bb + cbc b.

(4.2)

(4.3)

obviously, the term to be added to scl(a + q) has a structure which is analogous to the
right hand side of eq. (3.5). furthermore, x is chosen to be a sp(2)scalar, dax = 0;
in fact, it is the only one we are able to build up linear in the antields. now, because
scl(a + q) is gauge invariant and since, by virtue of (4.2), one veries the equalities
m( 1
m + m2]x = 0, it easily
sc
follows that w (0)

m is both (anti)brst and sp(2)invariant,

mdax = 0 and [da, 1

m + m2)x = 1

here, the (anti)brst- transformations of ai and qi are obtained from the typeii trans-
formations (1.7) with  replaced by the (anti)ghosts c a. (let us point to the fact that
for irreducible gauge theories the auxiliary eld b and the (anti)ghosts c b are related
to each other according to b = 1
mc b.) in principle, one could replace also the
typeiii transformations (1.8) by dening sa
(q)c a;
but, such a denition comes into conict with the background gauge covariance of the
theory.

thus, the dependence of w (0)
b and b is completely determined by
the classical master equations (4.1) together with the relations (4.7) and (4.8). (the b
dependence is much more involved; it will be considered later on.) of course, eqs. (4.10)
replace the last ve sets of eqs. in (4.5). this allows to rewrite the action (4.3) as

which is a proper solution of the classical master equations being regular in the neighbor-
hood of the stationary point.
(b) gauging of the proper solution
in order to lift the degeneracy of w (0)
m we still have to introduce a gauge. the corre-
sponding extended action w (0)
m,ext is obtained from the canonical transformation eq. (3.15)
according to the choice eq. (3.19). in the case of linear dependence on the antields this
transformation reduces considerably. namely, choosing a minimal gauge, i.e., a gauge
which depends only on the independent dynamical elds qi and c a, the extended action
w (0)

m,ext is obtained through the following construction

w (0)

m,ext = w (0)

m + ( 1

2absb

m + m2)f with f = 1

2(gijqiqj + gcdc cc d),

(4.12)

 being an arbitrary gauge parameter. again, the gaugexing functional f is assumed
to be a sp(2)scalar, daf = 0. the gauge xing terms in (4.12) extend the action w (0)
according to

where use has been made of the relations (1.4) and (1.5). note, that this background
gauge is nonlinear due the occurence of quartic (anti)ghosts terms. by construction,
w (0)

m,ext is both (anti)brst and sp(2)invariant,

m,ext = 0,

m,ext = 0.

hence, it provides also a solution of the eqs. (4.1) and, in addition, it satises the con-
straints implied by the eqs. (4.7) and (4.8).
furthermore, it can be veried that w (0)

m,ext, in accordance with (1.6)  (1.8), is invariant
under both background gauge (typei) as well as quantum gauge (typeii and typeiii)

5 general solution of the master equations

so far, we have ignored the important question whether the action (4.13), which was
supposed to be linear with respect to the antields, is the general solution of the classical
master equations (4.1) subjected to the conditions (4.7) and (4.8). unfortunately, this is
not the case because w (0)
m is not stable against small perturbations. this may be traced
back to the fact that the elds qi, c b and the related antields qi, eb have the same
quantum numbers, respectively, and therefore mix under renormalization. more precisely,
without violating the osp(1, 2)superalgebra the (anti)brst and sp(2)transformations
(4.4) may be altered with qi, c b and b = 1

mc b being replaced by

2basa

qi  qi + (1  )gij qj,

(5.1)

c b  c b + (1  )1gbc ec

and

b  b + 1

bc,

respectively,  and  being independent dimensionless parameters; 1 has been intro-
duced for later convenience where it will be identied with the (inverse) gauge parameter
(before introducing a gauge we could use  = 1). now, in order to ensure stability of the
tree action we introduce the antields in a nonlinear way by terms which depend on 
and . of course, if the action depends nonlinearly on the antields these quantities lose
their interpretation as sources of the (anti)brst transforms of the elds.
(a) general solution of the classical master equations prior to gauge xing
let us ignore the procedure of generalized canonical transformations as introduced in

16

section iii and simply change the solution w (0)
m in an analogous way as we have done for
xing the gauge, namely by adding the following nonlinear terms (  1  ,   1  ),

xm = w (0)

2(gij qi qj + 1gcd ec ed).

carrying out the replacements (5.1) in the proper solution (4.11) and making use of (4.5)
and (4.10) then for the resulting functional, xm, one gets

xm = scl(a + q)  ha( c a  1gab eb)

by construction xm is both (anti)brst and sp(2)invariant,

xm = 0,

da xm = 0.

but, unfortunately, owing to its nonlinear dependence on the antields it does not solve
the master equations (4.1); instead it holds

xm = (1  )1gab  xm

the reason for this failure is that we did not really apply the correct transformation
law, eq. (3.15). however, the symmetry breaking term on the right hand side may be
compensated by the following construction

m = xm + 1
s(0)

4(1  )1g  xm

(5.2)

of course, by using the more sophisticated transformation law, eq. (3.15), with the choice
eq. (3.12), for the generating functional g we would be led directly to expression (5.2).
(b) determination of the tree action s(0)
now, we are left with the problem to introduce a gauge. again, we choose the minimal
gauge by the functional f () since any other term, which could be considered as part
of a nonminimal gauge, already have been taken into account by the above construction.
analogous to eq. (5.2) it is given by

m,ext

m,ext = ym + 1

as it is obvious by the very construction, s(0)
m,ext is the general solution of the classical
master equations. by a straightforward, but lenghty calculation it can be veried also
directly that s(0)
m,ext obeys the master equations (4.1) subjected to the conditions (4.7) and
(4.8). as usual, it serves as the tree approximation (0)
m of the generating functional of
the oneparticleirreducible vertex functions of the theory. in addition, it may be shown
that s(0)

m,ext obeys the properly generalized symmetries (4.14)  (4.16).

after all, the elds and antields together with the independent parameters of the

solution (5.3) may be multiplicatively redened by corresponding zfactors,

here, zg is a factor by which the classical action can be multiplied, corresponding to a
redenition of the gauge coupling constant g, and z, z, z and zm are normalization
factors related to the parameters , ,  and the mass m, respectively. therefore, the
general solution of the eqs. (4.1) contains, in total, seven independent zfactors. let us
emphazise that this is not in contradiction to ref. [22] where, reanalysing the renormal-
ization of massive gauge theories due to curci and ferrari in delbourgojarvis gauge [23],
only ve independent zfactors have been found. the reason is, that in ref. [22] neither
antibrst nor sp(2)invariance has been required thus avoiding the zfactors z and z.

(5.8)

this is just the equation of motion of the auxiliary eld b. as we will show in the next
section the equations of motion for the (anti)ghost elds c b are direct consequences of
eq. (5.8) and the master equations.

now, if the equation of motion (5.8) is required the zfactors z q as well as z, z and

z are xed according to

z q = 1,

z = zqz1
b ,

z = zq,

z = zqzb,

(5.9)

and the general solution depends only on the three independent zfactors zg, zq and
zb, which are to be xed by suitable normalization conditions. obviously, qi is not
subjected to any renormalization; this property turns out to be essential for the study
of the dependence of the greens functions on the background eld ai (see section vii
below).
(c) generalization to higher orders
now the solution (5.3), including the zfactors, has to be generalized to any order of
perturbation theory such that

sm,ext =



xn=0

ns(n)

m,ext,

fullls the quantum master equations (2.14) and (2.15) as well as obeys the typei and the
(broken) typeii and typeiii symmetry. let us emphazise that sm,ext is a local functional
in the elds and the antields. at lowest order sm,ext coincides with the solution s(0)
m,ext,
eq. (5.3). furthermore, in order to ensure that sm,ext depends on b and b 
b only through
the combinations (4.9) the constraints (4.7) and (4.8) will be required to be valid at any
order of ; due their linearity these requirements can be realized for any renormalized
action sm,ext, e.g., by the help of the renormalized quantum action principles [20]. in the
same manner, also the validity of the equation of motion for the auxiliary eld b could
be required.

in the following, however, we are mainly interested in the generating functionals of the
greens functions, zm, and the 1pi vertex functions, m. however, the vertex functional

m =



xn=0

n(n)
m ,

is a nonlocal solution of the classical master equations (compare ward identities (6.3) and
(6.4) below) which at leading order coincides with s(0)

m,ext.

6 ward identities and equations of motion

now we shall derive the ward identities, being a consequence of the symmetry properties
a, , ) which are due to the osp(1, 2)
of the (renormalized) extended action sm,ext(a|, 
m and a. moreover, in the case of background
superalgebra observed by the generators a

19

gauges, besides of typei invariance, additional (broken) ward identities arise which are
due to the typeii and typeiii symmetry.

let us introduce sources ji = (ji, k, lb) for the elds i = (qi, b, c b). then the

extended generating functional of greens functions zm(a|j, 

zm(a|j, 

a, , ) = z d exp(cid:8)(i/)(sm,ext(a|, 

a, , ) is dened as
a, , ) + jii)(cid:9).

(6.1)

multiplying eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) by exp(cid:8)(i/)jii(cid:9), integrating them over i,

z d exp(cid:8)(i/)jii(cid:9) a
z d exp(cid:8)(i/)jii(cid:9) a exp{(i/)sm,ext} = 0,

m exp{(i/)sm,ext} = 0,

and assuming, after integrating by parts, that the integrated expressions vanish, one can
rewrite the resulting equalities by the help of the denition (6.1) as

a

+ lb

mozm = 0,

n(a) a

b la

+ vaozm = 0,

which are just the ward identities for the generating functional of greens functions due
to the osp(1, 2)symmetry of the theory.

introducing, as usual, the 1pi vertex functional, m(a|, 

a, , ), according to

m = i lnzm  jii with i = i

we obtain

for yang-mills theories the eqs. (6.3) are the slavnov-taylor identities of the extended
brstsymmetry. furthermore, the eqs. (6.4) for a = 0 express the ghost number
conservation and, in yang-mills theories, for a =  they are the delduc-sorella identities
[24] of the sp(2)symmetry.

in order to ensure typei invariance m will be required to full the kluberg-stern

zuber identity [11] which is governed by

here, the ellipses . . . indicate the contributions of all the other elds and antields which
transform homogeneously (see eqs. (4.17)) and which for the following considerations are
irrelevant (since they are identical for analogous expressions occuring below). this identity
expresses the fact that ai may be gauged arbitrarily if m depends gaugecovariant on
it. let us notice, that this identity is dened only for ai 6= 0. hence, to x the ai
dependence of m by means of an operator equation, we still need another identity which
is valid also for ai = 0. such an identity appears as a consistency condition:

20

if the bdependence of m is restricted by imposing the same equation of motion as it
holds for s(0)
m,ext then, by virtue of the ward identities (6.3), that requirement leads, rst of
all, to the (anti)ghost equations of motion. next, taking into account the ward identities
(6.3) from the (anti)ghost equations of motion we obtain the so-called lee identity, which
is nothing else but the ward identity of typeii symmetry.
derivation of the lee identity
to begin with, let us require that the b-dependence of m is governed by eq. (5.8) with
s(0)
m,ext replaced by m,

ebc b.

(6.6)

since this equation contains only terms being linear with respect to qi, b and c b
its validity can be simply established by the help of the renormalized quantum action
principles [20]. of course, this requirement is equivalent to the related one that the z
factors z q, z, z and z, being formal power series in , are determined through eqs. (5.9)
at any order of perturbation theory.

let us now apply l/b on the identities (6.3) and (6.4) we nd as necessary condi-

tions for m:

[ qa, qb] = abc qc,

[ qa, qa

m(a) a
b ,

{ qa

m, qb

m} = m2(a)ab qa.

let note, that these operators are related to the untilded ones introduced by eqs. (3.2);
however, they are rstorder dierential operators. the rst of the conditions (6.7) can
be rewritten as

0 = qa

m

l
b m  qa

m(cid:16) l

b m + cde 

dc(cid:17)  ab(cid:16) l

c b m  hb(cid:17);

(6.9)

the second condition (6.7) gives no further constraint. thus, if the bdependence of m
is xed by imposing the equation of motion (6.6) its c bdependence is restricted by

l
c b m  hb = ab qa

m(cid:16) l

b m + cde 

dc(cid:17).

(6.10)

in fact, this is nothing else then the (anti)ghost equation of motion. this may be shown
by using the explicit expression (6.6) for lm/b:

7 background dependence of greens functions

now, having completely characterized the symmetry properties of m let us enquire into
its aidependence. this is achieved by comparing the kluberg-sternzuber identity (6.5)
with the lee identity (6.13) which leads to the dierential equation

(7.2)

i.e., the aidependence is completely determined by the qi and qidependence of the
corresponding functional m(0|,

by making use of eq. (7.1) the lee identity (6.13) can be cast into the form

(7.5)

together with eq. (7.2) this is the main result of this section.
background dependence of physical greens functions
in order to apply this exact relation we consider physical greens functions, i.e., onshall

a, , } = 0(cid:1) of transverse gauge elds,
greens functions zphys(a|j) := z(cid:0)a|j, {k, lb; 
gijri
(a)(/jj)zphys(a|j) = 0, for m = 0 and choosing the landau gauge  = 0. in
doing that, we rst set ai = 0 and put  with the exception of ji and qi  any of the
a, , ) equal to zero. then, the problem consists in determining the
sources in zm(0|j, 
explicit qidependence of zm(0|j, q).

to begin with, let us write down the rigid ward identity (7.4) and the lee identity

(7.3) for the particular case under consideration,

z d4x rzm(0|j, q) = 0,
jj(cid:17)zm(0|j, q) = 0,

(7.6)



 qj(cid:17) + r,

where the operator l diers from r only by divergence terms, i.e., terms proportional
to ri

(0) which vanish after integration over spacetime.

23

in the limit qi = 0 the following general ansatz for l has to be taken when applied

to zm(0|j, 0):

z d4x rzm(0|j, 0) = 0,
jj(cid:17)zm(0|j, 0) = 0,

(7.7)

l = ri

q ji(cid:1) + r,

with z1
q being the zfactor of ji. the necessity for making that ansatz results from the
fact that in the case qi = 0 the identities (6.13) and (7.3) are undened. comparing (7.6)
and (7.7) the qidependence of zm(0|j, q) is obtained:
zm(0|j, q) = expn(i/)(  z1

jiozm(0|j). (7.8)

2 m2 qi qj(cid:1)o expnm2 qi

q )gij(cid:0)ji qj + 1



this relation immediately leads to the conclusion that, in the absence of sources ji and

qi, the following equality holds z(0)/ qi  (cid:0)zm(0|j, q)/ qi(cid:1)|j= q=m=0 = 0. this
property, which for the analogous case of the background eld ai instead of qi already
has been noted in the rst of refs. [11], turns out to be essential for the study of the
aidependence.

now, we are able to consider the case ai

6= 0.

inserting the expression (7.8) for

zm(0|j, q) into the relation (see eq. (7.5))
zm(a|j, q) = expn

(cid:0)jiai  1



2m2gijaiaj(cid:1)oexpngijai(cid:16)

we get

zm(a|j, q) = expn(i/)(  z1
expn (i/)z1

q )gij(cid:0)ji qj + 1
q (cid:0)jiai  1

jjozm(0|j, 0).
here, we can put qi = 0 and obtain the relation between zm(a|j) and zm(0|j) we are
looking for, namely

2m2gijaiaj(cid:1)o expn m2gijai 

2m2 qi qj(cid:1)o 

zm(a|j) = expn (i/)z1

q (cid:0)jiai  1

2m2gijaiaj(cid:1)o expn  m2gijai 

jjozm(0|j). (7.9)

notice, that for m = 0 and choosing the landau gauge  = 0 this relation coincides with
a corresponding result obtained by rouet using a quite dierent method [15]:

zphys(a|j) = exp(cid:8)  (i/)z1

q jiai(cid:9)zphys(0|j).

this relation states that physical greens functions in a background gauge are obtained
from the greens functions without background eld by a mere translation.

finally, let us point at the similarity between the relations (7.8) and (7.9), which
indicates that qi for ai = 0 plays the role of a background eld (because of the above
mentioned property z(0)/ qi = 0 in the absence of ji and qi). that is the reason
why generally one should require not only background gauge (typei) invariance but also
quantum gauge (typeii and typeiii) invariance: both symmetry requirements together
ensure that neither ai nor qi are subjected to any renormalization.

24

8 ultraviolet asymptotics

now we are going to show that the ultraviolet asymptotics of m is independent of the
background eld ai. in order to obtain this result we derive the renormalization group
equation and prove, making use of the basic relation (7.2), that the function and the
anomalous dimensions in the presence of a background eld ai agree with the correspond-
ing ones for ai = 0.

for a consistent treatment of the ultraviolet divergences emerging from the feynman
graphs the bphzl subtraction scheme [19] will be employed which allows the application
of the renormalized quantum action principles [20]. in this scheme the mass m is replaced
by ms = (1  s)m, where the parameter s (0  s  1) is incorporated in order to avoid
spurious infrared singularities which would occure by ultraviolet subtractions at s = 1; it
interpolates between the massive (s = 0) and the massless (s = 1) case.

in order to x m completely we have to choose suitable normalization conditions for
the independent z-factors zg, zq and zb, being formal power series in  (not to be specied
further). denoting the (euclidean) normalization point by 2, the physical content of the
theory must be independent on how 2 is chosen. this requirement is expressed by the
renormalization group equation which relates the action of   2/2 on m to a
corresponding change of the independent parameters of the theory.

as is well known m, by the quantum action principle, denes an insertion :

m =   m =  + o().

(8.1)

now, it is our task to expand this insertion  into a suitable basis of independent sym-
metric insertions.
in general, an insertion  is called symmetric if the corresponding
dierential operator  satises a set of constraints which are related to the symmetry
properties of m:

first, as m is assumed to full the ward identities of both the (anti)brst and

sp(2)symmetry,

the operator  is restricted to

sa

m(m) = 0,

da(m) = 0,

[ qa

m, ]m = 0,

[ qa, ]m = 0,

(8.2)

where qa
of motion for the auxiliary elds (see eq. (6.6)),

m and qa are dened by eqs. (6.8). second, because m obeys both the equations

 will be required further to satisfy the following relations:

[b, ]m = 0,

[cb, ]m = 0;

(8.3)

nally, since m obeys the ward identities of typei, typeii and typeiii invariance (see
eqs. (6.5), (6.13) and (7.3)), respectively,

km = 0,

lm = m2gijri

(a)qj, wm = m2gijri

(0)qj,

 should also satisfy the following relations:

[k, ]m = 0,

[l, ]m = 0,

[w, ]m = 0.

(8.4)

since neither qa

m and qa nor b, cb, k, l and w depend on the normalization
point , the operator  obiously is symmetric. hence, our task is to construct a basis for
any symmetric dierential operator in a form which permits a generalization to all orders
of . this is most easily done by using the results of section iv; actually one needs only
the eqs. (5.7) and (5.9) for the z-factors.

a basis of symmetric operators which full the requirements (8.2), as can be deduced

from eqs. (5.7), consists of seven dierential operators which are given by

and the following counting operators:

hence, any osp(1, 2)symmetric dierential operator  can be expanded with respect to
this basis:

g

+ 




+ qnq +  qn q + bnb.

(8.5)

obviously, these symmetric dierential operators are independent of the background eld.
now, requiring that  satises also the constraints (8.3) and (8.4) leads, in accordance

with (5.9), to the restrictions

 q = 0,

 = q  b,

 = q,

 = q + b,

26

so that the expansion (8.5) reduces to

 = gg


g

+ q nq + b nb,

(8.6)

where nq and nb are given by

nq  nq + 




+ 




+ 




,

nb  nb  




+ 




.

now, having dened to any order of  a basis of symmetric dierential operators let
us return to our starting point: expanding   m on the righthand side of eq. (8.1)
on the basis of symmetric insertions generated by the operator (8.6) the renormalization
group equation in the background gauge reads

2 

2 m(a|, 

a, , ) = (cid:0)gg


g

+ q nq + b nb(cid:1)m(a|, 

a, , ),

(8.7)

where the function g and the anomalous dimensions q, b start at rst order in .
next, by virtue of eq. (7.2), from the previous relation (8.7) one obtains

2 

2 m(0|, 

a, , ) = (cid:0)gg


g

+ q nq + b nb(cid:1)m(0|, 

a, , ),

(8.8)

which is just the renormalization group equation for ai = 0. thus, since the coecients
g, q and b in both renormalization group equations are the same, it is proven that the
ultraviolet asymptotics of the vertex functions is in fact independent of the background
eld ai to all orders of perturbation theory.

9 concluding remarks

under the assumption of a linear quantumbackground splitting it has been shown that
for irreducible massive gauge theories with a generic background eld the renormalized
generating functional m(a) is invariant under background (typei) as well as quantum
(typeii and typeiii) gauge transformations, thereby generalizing the results of ref. [16].
the aidependence of m(a) is completely xed by these symmetry requirements.
in
order to determine the aidependence of m(a) explicitely one only has to determine the
dependence of m(0) on the gauge elds qi and the associated antields qi. furthermore,
it was proven that introducing an background gauge does not change the ultraviolet
asymptotics of the theory.

more general, if the classical action is not only gauge but also conformal invariant and
if ai, like the instanton congurations, is a solution of the equation of motion for qi which
breaks the conformal symmetry, then similar conclusions can be drawn generalizing the
present results.

in the case of a nonlinear quantumbackground splitting  which takes place, e.g., for
n = 1 supersymmetric theories  the situation is much more involved, since then both
the typeii and typeiii symmetries are nonlinear ones. in this case the determination
of the background dependence turns out to be very complicated.
