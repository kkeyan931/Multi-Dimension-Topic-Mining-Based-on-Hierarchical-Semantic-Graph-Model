abstract

in the present article we solve the dirac-pauli and klein gordon equations in
an asymptotically uniformly accelerated frame when a constant magnetic eld
is present. we compute, via the bogoliubov coecients, the density of scalar
and spin 1/2 particles created. we discuss the role played by the magnetic
eld and the thermal character of the spectrum.

i. introduction

the study of quantum eects in nonintertial frames of reference has been thoroughly
discussed in the literature. the pioneer articles of fulling and unruh1,2 showing the non-
equivalence of the quantization of scalar elds in rindler and minkowski coordinates and
the thermal character of the radiation were the origin of a large body of articles devoted
to analyze quantum measurement processes in uniformly accelerated frames and possible
interpretations thereof.

the advantage of considering rindler coordinates are many. they can be associated
with a uniformly accelerated observer. they also possess a global timelike killing vector
and the (massive and massless) klein-gordon as well as the dirac equations are separable in
the rindler coordinates. the rindler coordinates can be extended to cover the whole space
time and thermal eects can be related, via the equivalence principle, with the hawking
eect3,4.

the study of quantum eects in non uniformly accelerated frames of reference presents,
at rst glance, dierent technical problems. among them we can mention that the system
of coordinates associated with non-rindler kinematics do not possess in general a timelike
killing vector, and therefore a standard interpretation of positive and negative frequency
solutions is absent. the complete separation of variables of the klein-gordon and the dirac
equations is possible only in a restricted set of coordinates, and those coordinates allowing
separability sometimes present coordinate singularities; therefore the quantization scheme
fails.

among the non-static coordinate systems where the klein-gordon and dirac equations

separate we have5,6

t + x = 2

 sinh  (t + x) , t  x = 1

 e(tx), y = y, z = z .

the line element associated with the coordinate transformation (1.1) is

ds2 =(cid:0)e2t + e2x(cid:1)(cid:0)dx 2  dt 2(cid:1) + dy2 + dz2.

(1.1)

(1.2)

the separability of he klein-gordon equation in (1.1) has been discussed by kalnins5,

one the authors has accomplished a complete separability of the dirac7 equation in (1.1).

the kinematics associated with the coordinates (1.1) have been exhaustively analyzed

by costa6,8. the proper time along x = x0 is

s =

1


e2t + e2x0 +

ex0 sinh1 e(t +x0).

considering t as the evolution parameter, we have that an observer co-moving to the system
(1.1) has a four-velocity given by

v =(cid:16) cosh  (x + t ) + e(xt )

2

e2t + e2x
and experiences an acceleration whose components are

ay = 0,

az = 0.

(1.4)
from the absolute value of the acceleration, we readily obtain that a = |aa|1/2 takes the
form

a = e2x(cid:0)e2t + e2x(cid:1) 3

2 .

(1.5)

from (1.5) we obtain that the accelerated frame becomes inertial as t  , and on the
other hand it evolves toward an uniformly accelerated frame as t  +.
quantum eects in the non-inertial frame (1.1) have been discussed by costa6 and by
percoco and villalba9 for dirac particles. the nonexistence of a global timelike killing vector
for the line element (1.2) precludes making a straightforward identication of the positive and
negative frequency solutions of the scalar and dirac wave equations. in order to circumvent
this diculty, we identify positive and negative frequency modes comparing the asymptotic
solutions of the wave equations with those obtained for the relativistic hamilton-jacobi
equation

recently, bautista10, has discussed, in a rindler accelerated frame, vacuum eect asso-
ciated with a spin 1/2 particle with anomalous magnetic moment in a constant magnetic
eld directed along the acceleration. the author obtains a planckian distribution of created
particles that depends on the magnetic eld via the non-minimal anomalous coupling. the
author also discusses deviation of the energy density from a thermal distribution due to the
magnetic eld. as a preliminary step towards a deeper understanding of quantum processes
in non inertial frames of reference,
in the present paper we analyze vacuum eects associ-
ated with scalar and spin 1/2 particles in the coordinates (1.1), when a constant magnetic
eld is also present.

the article is structured as follows: in section ii, we solve the relativistic hamilton-
jacobi equation with a constant magnetic eld in the accelerated frame (1.1). in sec. iii,
we solve the klein-gordon equation and compute the rate of scalar particles created. in
sec. iv, we solve the dirac equation with anomalous magnetic moment and compute the
density of particles related by the magnetic eld in the non inertial frame (1.1). finally, we
discuss the results obtained in this article in sec. v.

ii. solution of the hamilton-jacobi equation

the relativistic hamilton-jacobi equation coupled to an electromagnetic eld can be

written as6,11

g (s  ea) (s  ea) + m2 = 0

(2.1)

where here and elsewhere we adopt the units where c = 1, and  = 1. the vector potential
associated with a constant magnetic eld ~b = bx x directed along the acceleration (1.4)
has the form

a = (0, 0, bxz, 0)

(2.2)

3

it is not dicult to verify that (2.2) satises the conditions a = 0 and f f = 2b2
x.

substituting the line element (1.2) into (2.1) we obtain

1

e2x +e2t (cid:2)(xs)2  (t s)2(cid:3) + (oz  ys)2 + (zs)2 + m2 = 0

where o = ebx . the solution of eq. (2.3) has the form

(2.3)

(2.4)

s(x, y, z, t ) = kyy  ir qm2  2 + (ky + oz)2dz

which in the asymptotic limit as x   and t   reduces to

r k  2e2xdx r k + 2e2t dt,
s(x, y, z, t ) = kyy  iz qm2  2 + (ky + oz)2dz  i




ex 




et .

(2.5)

the wave function u(x, y, z, t ) = eis gives the quasi-classical asymptotes of the solutions of
the klein-gordon and dirac equations. in the remote past, as t  , u(x, y, z, t )
takes the form

u(x, y, z, t ) = c(y, z)e 

 ex

 et

cei 

(2.6)

where in (2.6) the upper and lower signs correspond respectively to positive and negative
frequency modes.

analogously, we have that as x   and t   (2.4) reduces to
s(x, y, z, t ) = kyy  iz qm2  2 + (ky + oz)2dz  i
kt

and consequently,

u(x, y, z, t ) = c(y, z)e 

 ex

eikt exp(

)

(2.8)

where, in the present case, the upper sign corresponds to positive frequency modes and the
lower sign to negative modes.

the results (2.6) and (2.8) give the quasi-classical asymptotic behaviors of the relativistic

wave equations in the accelerated coordinates (1.1).

iii. solution of the klein gordon equation

in this section we proceed to solve the klein-gordon equation, coupled to a constant

magnetic eld, in the accelerated coordinates with the line element given by (1.2).

the covariant generalization of the klein gordon equation is4,12

g(  iea)(  iea)  m2 = 0

(3.1)

where  =    is the covariant derivative, and a is the vector potential given by
(2.2).

substituting eq. (1.2) into (3.1) we readily obtain

x(cid:1) (cid:0)2

y + 2

z(cid:1) + i2ebxzy + e2b2

xz2  m2(cid:21)  = 0.

(3.2)

since eq. (3.2) commutes with the operator iy we can look for a solution of the form
 = (x, z, t )eikyy which reduces eq. (3.2) to

(cid:26)

e2t + e2x (cid:0)2

t  2

x(cid:1) + (ebxz  ky)2  2

z  m2(cid:27)  = 0.

(3.3)

eq. (3.3) can be separated in the form (x, z, t ) = (x, t )f (z). the resulting equations
are

x(cid:1) + 2(cid:21)  = 0

(3.4)

(3.5)

where  is a separation constant. variables x and t can be separated in eq. (3.4) after
making the substitution: (x, t ) = fx(x)ft (t ). the resulting equations for x and t are

d2fx

dx 2 = (cid:0)2e2x + 2(cid:1) fx(x)
dt 2 = (cid:0)+2e2t + 2(cid:1) ft (t )

d2ft

(3.6)

(3.7)

where  is a constant of separation. eq. (3.6) takes a more familiar form in terms of bessel
functions13,14 after introducing the variable u = ex

ex(cid:19)

(3.9)

where a , b are arbitrary constants and  =

the same manner. introducing the change of variables v = et in (3.7) we get the bessel
equation

in order to solve eq.(3.5), we introduce the new variable x =q 2

(3.12)

where a =  2+2

of eq. (3.5 ) is

2o

. eq. (3.12) is the parabolic cylinder equation13. therefore the solution

f (x) = u(cid:18)a,r 2

o

(oz + ky)(cid:19)

(3.13)

let us analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of eq. (3.2) as x   and

t   we obtain that
(x, t ) = ki(cid:0)

comparing (3.14) with (2.6) we identify the rst right hand side term as a positive frequency
mode, and the second term as a negative frequency. on the other hand when x   and
t   we obtain
(x, t ) = ki(cid:0)

 ex(cid:16)a

(3.15)



also, comparing (3.15) with (2.8) we can identify the rst and second right hand side

terms in (3.15) as positive and negative frequency modes respectively.

now, we are going to express an inertial positive frequency mode (t  )

inertial(x, t ) = c0ki(cid:18)

ex(cid:19) ji(cid:18) 



et(cid:19)

(3.16)

(3.17)

where c1 and c0 are normalization constants according to the standard inner product3
~si )dss for the klein gordon equation. the recurrence relation
i (z) and ji(z) permits one to express inertial(x, t ) in terms of acc(x, t ) as

hi, ji = ir (i

~sj j

between h (1)
follows

inertial(x, t ) =

c0

c1 (cid:20) e

sinh 

acc(x, t )

sinh 

acc(x, t )(cid:21) .

(3.18)

since the inertial and accelerated modes are related via the bogoliubov coecients3,4  and


i(inertial) =xj

ijj(acc) + ijj(acc)

we have that eq. (3.18) gives immediately the values of ij and ij

ij =

the density of created particles15 has the form

e2  1

which can be identied as a planck distribution with a temperature

to =



2kb

the temperature measured by the accelerated observer can be obtained using the relation3,16:

(3.24)
in the asymptotic limit as t  + we have limt+ (g00)1/2 = ex and the temperature
t takes the value

t = (g00)1/2 to

t =

2kb

=

a+
2kb

(3.25)

then we obtain that the temperature is proportional to the asymptotic value of the acceler-
ation.

iv. solution of the dirac-pauli equation

in this section we solve the dirac equation with anomalous magnetic moment in the

accelerated coordinates (1.1) when a constant magnetic eld is present.

the covariant generalization of the dirac-pauli equation in curvilinear coordinates is10,12

n(  ) +


2

f + mo  = 0

(4.1)

where  are the curvilinear dirac matrices satisfying the anticommutation relations

(cid:8), (cid:9)+ = 2g,  are the spinor connections and f is the electromagnetic ten-
sor. the curvilinear  matrices are related to the constant minkowski i matrices with
{i, j}+ = 2ij via the tetrad h

i

7

 = h

i i

(4.2)

in order to write the curvilinear dirac matrices in eq (4.1) we have to choose a tetrad h
here we are going to work in the diagonal tetrad gauge, where h

i takes the form

with s = 1

(4.9)

where o = bx . in order to solve eq. (4.9) we proceed to separate variables using the
algebraic method of separation developed by shishkin and villalba7,1820 the idea behind
the method is to reduce eq. (4.9) to a sum of two commuting rst order dierential operators

(cid:16) k1(t, x) + k2(y, z)(cid:17)  = 0,

h k1(t, x), k2(y, z)i

= 0

(4.10)

8

where in the present case,  = 32 and

k1 =

123x + 423t

e2x + e2t

,

k2 = 3(cid:18)y  i

ebx2

z(cid:19)  2z + 23m  io.

since k1 and k2 satisfy (4.10) they satisfy the eigenvalue equations

k1 = i, k2 = i.

now, we proceed to solve equation k1 = i :

(cid:0)123x + 423t(cid:1)  = ipe2x + e2t 

applying the transformation  = s dened by :

s = e(x,t )e(i14(x,t ))

we reduce eq. (4.13) to the form

(123x + 423t )  + 123 [x(x, t ) + it (x, t )] +

+423 [t (x, t ) + ix(x, t )]  = ie2x + e2t e2i14(x,t )

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

in order to separate variables in (4.15) we demand that the terms inside the brackets vanish,
i.e.

x(x, t ) = it (x, t ),

t (x, t ) = ix (x, t )

the solution of eq. (4.16) is

(x, t ) =

i
2

arctan(cid:0)e(x+t )(cid:1) , (x, t ) =

1
2

arctan(cid:0)e(x+t )(cid:1)

which determines the spinor transformation s eq. (4.14). eq. (4.15) reduces to

(cid:0)123x + 423t(cid:1)  = i(cid:0)ex + i14et(cid:1) .

let l1 and l2 be the commuting operators

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

l1 = 123x  iex, l2 = 123t + et ,
eq. (4.18) can be expressed in terms of l1 and l2 as follows:

[l1, l2] = 0.

(4.19)

in order to solve eq. (4.20) we introduce the auxiliary spinor

substituting (4.21) into (4.20) we have that (l114l1  l214l2) w = 0. this allows
separation of variables as follows:

(cid:0)l1 + l214(cid:1)  = 0.

t + 2e2t + et 123(cid:1) w = 2w
(cid:0)2

where  is a constant of separation.

then the spinor w has the structure:

substituting (4.25) into eq. (4.22) we obtain

w =

(4.32)

the system of equations (4.26) can be written as a coupled system of ordinary dierential

now we proceed to solve the equations (4.12) governing the dependence of the spinor solution
of the dirac equation on the coordinates y and z

(cid:0)3 (y  iebxz)  2z + 23m  io(cid:1)  = i.

since h k2,iyi

 = eikyy(z),

substituting (4.42) into (4.41) we obtain

(cid:0)i3 (ky + oz)  2z + 23(cid:1)  = i ( + o) 

where o = ebx. introducing the spinor  =  with

we reduce our problem to that of solving the following system of partial dierential equations:

[z  (ky + oz)] 4 = ( +  + o) 1, [z + (ky + oz)] 1 = (    o) 4,

(4.47)

[z  (ky + oz)] 2 = ( +  + o) 3, [z + (ky + oz)] 3 = (    o) 2.

now, we proceed to analyze the asymptotic limits as t   and t  +. we will
conne our attention to the solutions of the spinor (4.57). in the asymptotes we obtain a
time dependent term multiplied by a factor depending on space variables. here, we proceed
like we did in sec. iii for the scalar case.

the relation between w,(z) and m,(z)22 will be helpful

w,(z) =

( 1

m,(z) +

(2)

( 1

m,(z)

(4.58)

taking into account expression (4.58) we nd that the solutions of eq. (4.34) are related as
follows

w,(

v) =

( 1

m,(

( 1

(4.59)

looking at the quasi-classical behavior given by eq.
negative accelerated modes as

(2.8), we identify the positive and

acc
+ = n1m,(

2i


v), acc


= n1m,(

2i


v)

(4.60)

where n1 is a normalization constant. also an inertial (t  ) positive frequency mode
ine
+ is given by

ine
+ = n3w,(

2i


v)

(4.61)

where n3 is a normalization constant.

looking at eq. (4.59) and recalling that the inertial modes can be expressed in terms

of the accelerated positive and negative modes via the bogoliubov coecients

we get that

+ = acc
ine

+ + acc


,

(4.62)

(4.63)

and taking into account that ||2 + ||2 = 1, we nd that the density of particles created
is15



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = e 



(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(4.64)

a result that can be identied as a fermi-dirac distribution of particles associated with a
temperature

to =

and, consequently, the temperature detected in the accelerated frame is16

that in the asymptotic limit as t  + takes the form

t = (g00)1/2 to

t =

,

(4.65)

(4.66)

showing that the temperature is proportional to the asymptotic value of the acceleration.

v. discussion of the results

in the present paper we have separated variables and solved the klein-gordon and dirac
equations in the curvilinear coordinates (1.1) when a constant magnetic eld (2.2) is present.
the algebraic method of separation7,1820 has been applied to reduce dirac-pauli equation
to a system of coupled ordinary dierential equations. using the obtained exact solutions we
calculated the density of scalar and spin 1/2 particles detected by an accelerated observer
associated with system of coordinates (1.1) when a constant magnetic eld in the direction
of acceleration is present. the identication of positive and negative frequency modes was
carried out comparing the relativistic solutions with the quasi-classical hamilton-jacobi
solutions (2.6) and (2.8). the results obtained in sec iii and iv indicate that the magnetic
eld does not modify the thermal character of spectrum. the temperature associated with
the thermal bath is not modied by b. this result has a classical counterpart: since b
is colinear to the motion, it does not accelerate the particle and no radiation is caused by
it. the presence of a non minimal coupling in eq. (4.1) does not aect the density (4.64).
the proportionality between temperature and accelerations remains valid even if uniform
accelerations are reached asymptotically. the role of the anomalous magnetic moment in
the energy spectrum density will be discussed in a forthcoming publication.
