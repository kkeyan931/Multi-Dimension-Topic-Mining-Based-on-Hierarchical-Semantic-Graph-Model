abstract.

the straightforward description of q-deformed systems leads to transition amplitudes
that are not numerically valued. to give physical meaning to these expressions without
introducing ad hoc remedies, one may exploit an internal fock space already dened

by the q-algebra. this internal space may be interpreted in terms of internal degrees of
freedom of the deformed system or alternatively in terms of non-locality. it is shown that

the q-deformation may give stringy characteristics to a yang-mills theory.

1. introduction.

corresponding to the well known systems of quantum mehanics such as the harmonic
oscillator or the hydrogen atom there are q-systems obtained by going over to quantum
groups. the q-systems have more degrees of freedom than the system from which they
are derived. when the standard eld theories are similarly deformed the new degrees of
freedom may be interpreted as expressions of non-locality by extended particles. here we
explore one aspect of this non-locality as it might appear in q-yang-mills theories.

2. the q-yang-mills theory.

let (x) be the basis of the fundamental representation of a gauge group. then if

the covariant derivative  transforms as

(x) = t (x)(x)

so that

 = t t 1

 = t () .

the corresponding gauge eld a is dened by

then by (2.2)

the eld strength is

and transforms as

a =    .

a = t at 1 + t t 1 .

f = (, )

f  = t f t 1

by (1.2). the nature of the gauge group is so far unspecied.

we now assume that t suq(2). then

(2.12)

where l is a lorentz transformation and c is the charge conjugation matrix. the basic

here  is a lorentz scalar that is also a fundamental representation of suq(2).

the rst two terms of (2.13) are separately invariant and irreducible under suq(2).

the scalar contribution is invariant under only a subset of t transformations.

3. the suq(2) algebra.

let

t (0) = (cid:18) 0
q1 0

then (2.8) implies

then the elements of t (0) and t (x) satisfy the same relations (3.2). we shall write
(, , , ) for the space dependent matrix elements.

there is associated with the algebra (3.2) a state space. dene the ground state, |0i,

on n, i.e. they are arranged in geometric rather than arithmetic progression and in this
respect resemble the hni order of the q-oscillator.

4. an internal space.(1)

the existence of the algebra (3.2) leads to novel features of q-systems, as one sees in
the q-deformations of familiar elementary systems such as the harmonic oscillator and the
hydrogen atom.

in these examples one nds that the wave functions are not numerically valued, but lie
in the q-algebra. to interpret these results according to the usual rules, however, it is nec-
essary to calculate numerically valued transition probabilities between states represented
by these wave functions. there is a natural procedure for doing this by utilizing a fock
space associated with the algebra (3.2). if such a path is followed, however, these simple

4

one-particle problems like the oscillator and the hydrogen atom are endowed with internal
degrees of freedom or partially promoted to the complexity of quantum eld problems.
in a similar way a quantum eld-theoretic problem will acquire a second fock space or
internal degrees of freedom that can be given a non-local interpretation. we shall now see
how this might work out for any q-deformed eld theory, including yang-mills.

a general eld lying in the q-algebra will have the following expansion

(x) = x (cid:2)f(, x)a() + g(, x)b()(cid:3)

where

 = (~p, r, s)

2(cid:19)3/2z

= (cid:18) 1

f(, x) = xs
g(, x) = xs

u(~p, r, s)eipxs

v(~p, r, s)eipxs

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

here  is a generic tensor index, a and b are creation operators for particles and
antiparticles, the r-sum is the sum over dierent polarizations and the s-sum is the sum
over generators of the q-algebra.

we may set

 =

4

xs=1

ss

where the s may be chosen as follows:

s  ss = tjks,js,k .

(4.6)

(4.7)

this choice of the s implies a privileged gauge. any other linear combination is allowed.
a general gauge transormation will carry  into a space where the basis elements are no
longer linear in s.

5. energy and mass of a q-scalar particle.

let us consider the contribution of the scalar eld in (2.13). then the energy operator

is

where

e = z t00d~x =

1

2 z [()t + m2

0t]d~x

 = (cid:18) 1

2(cid:19)3/2z

d~p

(2p0)1/2 xs

u (p, s)(cid:2)eipsa(p, s) + eipxa(p, s)(cid:3)s

5

(5.1)

(5.2)

with the usual commutators for the a and a. here the s-sum is over the generators of the
q-gauge group. we shall compute just the contribution of the free eld, i.e. without the
vector interaction.

denote the basis states in fock space by |n ni. then

a(~p, s)a(~p, s)|n (~p, s)ni = n (~p, s)qnb|n (~p, s)ni(s, s)

(5.3)

where n (~p, s) is the population number of the state (~p, s).

now substitute (5.2) in (5.1) and use (5.3). then the eigenvalue of e is given by

e|n ni = z d~pxs

u (~p.s)tu (~p, s)pon (~p, s) 2

s |n ni

where

choose

where

by (5.4)

p2
o = ~p 2 + m2 .

s = s11

1 =  .

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.6b)

(5.8)

e|n (~p, 1)ni = z d~p(cid:2)u (~p, 1)tu (~p, 1)(cid:3)pon (~p, 1)2|n (~p, 1)ni .

the factor [u (p, 1)tu (p, 1)] is numerical and may be normalized to unity. then the
eigenvalues of the partial energy contributed by the free scalar eld are

e = z d~pn (~p, 1)poq2n+1 .

if q is near unity, say 1 + 

2 , then the mass is

moq2n+1 = mo(cid:18)1 +
= mo(cid:18)1 +



2(cid:19)2n+1
 + n(cid:19)

1
2

(5.9)

(5.10)

for low n. the mass lies between mo and innity and becomes unbounded as n becomes
large. it follows that a point particle with mass mo in a q = 1 theory becomes a particle
with a mass spectrum and internal degrees of freedom in a q 6= 1 theory. for small values
of n the mass spectrum resembles a string spectrum with the tension determined by q and
mo. if q < 1 spectrum will be inverted and bounded.

one may construct similar arguments for the mass terms of other q-elds. in every
case, however, the actual dependence of the eld on the q-algebra is gauge dependent.
to make sense of this procedure one requires the introduction of a privileged gauge, but

6

that is also the way in which the higgs mechanism and the symmetry breaking vacuum
completes the original yang-mills theory.

essentially equivalent to introducing an internal state space is averaging over the q-
group space with the aid of the woronowicz integral. in this alternative formulation one
replaces the action (2.13) which lies in the q-algebra, and is therefore not numerically
valued, by the following average over the algebra:

s = hz d4x l

(5.11)

where h stands for the haar measure, or the woronowicz integral, which is a linear func-
tional that may be evaluated term by term according to

h[sn m] = somn

qn

[m + 1]q

.

(5.12)

thus h projects out a power of   that is evaluated as the same power of q. this result
can be easily compared with the very similar result obtained by the alternative procedure
that employs the state space.

the apparent similarity of a local gauge theory based on suq(2) to one based on
if t1 and t2su (2)
su (2) is misleading, however, since only the latter has closure, i.e.
then t1t2su (2); but if t1 and t2suq(2) then t1t2/suq(2) unless the elements of t1
commute with the elements of t2.
in other words t1 and t2 must belong to dierent
copies of the algebra. for example, it is possible that t1 = t (x1) and t2 = t (x2) where
x1 and x2 both lie in spacetime but are not causally related; another possibility is oered
by a kaluza-klein theory if x1 and x2 do not both lie in 4-dimensional spacetime. such a
collection of transformations may be regarded as a non-local group.

alternatively one can assume that there are only two gauges and that t is a du-
ality transformation. one example of this kind of duality is realized by the q-harmonic
oscillator which has equivalent descriptions in terms of either (x, p) or (a, a). these two
representations are related by the q-canonical transformation:

a(cid:19) = t (cid:18) i
x (cid:19)
(cid:18) a
h p

t  suq(2) .

(5.13)

both sets satisfy q-commutation rules, namely:

aa  qaa = 1
qxp  px = ih

(5.14)

one may promote the oscillator to the role of a scalar eld by introducing the conjugate
elds (x) and (x) satisfying

q(x)(x)  (x)(x) = ih(x  x) .

(5.15)

7

if the fourier components of (x) and (x) are pk and qk and if we set

ak(cid:19) = t (cid:18) i
(cid:18) ak
qk (cid:19)
h pk

then the eld oscillators will satisfy q-commutators:

akak  qak ak = kk .

if one now calculates the energy of the free eld one nds the eigenvalues

instead of

hnkihk

nkhk .

if q is close to unity and we set q = 1 + , then

hence

hni =

qn  1
q  1

hni
n

= 1 +

n  1

hnih = n(cid:20)h +

n  1

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

(5.20)

(5.21)

(5.22)

this result may be interpreted to describe either a eld with populations of normal modes
increasing as hni with xed mass or as populations increasing linearly with n but with
increasing mass. this example diers from the preceding case in that here there is no
internal quantum number and in addition the eld commutators were normal in the
other case. both examples illustrate how the introduction of the q-algebra may alter the
particle spectrum.

to complete the discussion of this case it is again necessary to introduce the internal
space in order to compute transition probabilities. then the eld aquires an internal mass
spectrum as in the preceding example. in both cases the internal (, ) space is associated
with the algebra (3.2). in the present case the (, ) space results from (5.17). in the
previous (q-yang-mills) case the dynamical elds lie in the (3.2) algebra because of the
postulated suq(2) invariance.

6. transition amplitudes.

we may consider the emission of a q-vector by a q-spinor induced by the following

interaction appearing in (2.13):

z it(x)ca(x)(x)d~x

8

(6.1)

where

and

a(x) =

1

(2)3/2 z

d~p

(2po)1/2 xp

e()(cid:2)eipxa() + eipxa()(cid:3)

e() = xs

e(, s)s

 = (~p, r) .

(6.2)

(6.3)

here (~p, r) labels momentum and polarizatiion of the vector particle while s is to be
summed over a selected portion of the internal algebra generated by (, , , ). similarly
we set

then the general matrix element of interest is

(x) = xs

s(x)s .

z d~xhn n anna|it(x)ca(x)(x)|nnannai

(6.4)

(6.5)

where n and n refer to the external and internal fock spaces.

the emission of a specic vector particle () by the fermionic source will increase
the corresponding population of the eld from n to n + 1. if a single fermion makes a
transition from n to n in the same event then the amplitude for the joint transition is

z d~xhnna|it(x)c(x)a(x)|nnai(na + 1)1/2

or

z d~xhn|it(x)c(x)|nihna|a(x)|nai(na + 1)1/2 .

(6.6)

(6.7)

in the q = 1 theories there is no need of internal quantum numbers like n and na since
(x) and a(x) ae numerically valued in those theories.

note that if s or s is a function of  and  and does not contain free factors of 
and , then there is no change in internal quantum number in the transition. on the other
hand one has

for example, if q = 1  
2

hn| |ni = (n, n + 1)(1  q2n+2)1/2 .

h1| |0i = (1  q2)1/2

= 1/2 .

(6.8)

(6.9)

let the coupling constant, which has so far been suppressed, be g for the q = 1 theory.
then if q < 1, we see from (6.8) that the eective coupling constant is still close to g for
g
high n but from (6.9) we see that the eective g becomes
 for n = 0 and therefore
becomes very large for low n. if q > 1, |hn + 1| |ni|2  1
q2n+2 for high n and therefore the
eective coupling constant becomes weak for high n but is still large for low n.
