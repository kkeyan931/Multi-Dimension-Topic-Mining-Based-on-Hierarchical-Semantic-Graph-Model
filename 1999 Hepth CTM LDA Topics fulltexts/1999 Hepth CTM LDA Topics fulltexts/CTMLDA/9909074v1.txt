quantum eld theory in curved space-time is perhaps one of the most interesting and
puzzling problems in contemporary theoretical physics. after the publication of the pioneer
article by hawking [1] about pair production in the vicinity of a schwarzschild black hole,
a great body of papers have been published, mainly trying to understand the mechanism
that gives origin to the thermal particle distribution and its relation to thermodynamics. it
is noteworthy that hawkings result was preceded by a series of articles where the question
was to discuss particle production in cosmological universes [2,3]. almost all of the arti-
cles published in this area deal with isotropic and homogeneous gravitational backgrounds,
mainly in desitter and robertson walker models, and only a few try to discuss quantum
processes in anisotropic universes.

the study of quantum eects in gravitational backgrounds with initial singularities
presents an additional diculty. the techniques commonly applied in order to dene parti-
cle states are based on the existence of a timelike killing vector or an asymptotically static
metric [4]. a dierent approach is needed to circumvent the problem related to the initial
singularity. in this direction, the feynman path-integral method has been applied to the
quantization of a scalar eld moving in the the chitre-hartle universe [5,6]. this model
has a curvature singularity at t = 0, and it is perhaps the best known example where a time
singularity appears and consequently any adiabatic prescription in order to dene particle
states fails. a spin 1/2 extension has been considered by sahni. [7]

a dierent approach to the problem of classifying single particle states on curved spaces,
is based on the idea of diagonalizing the hamiltonian. this technique permits one to compute
the mean number of particles produced by a singular cosmological model, and in particular
by the chitre-hartle universe [5].

an interesting scenario for discussing particle creation processes is the anisotropic uni-

verse associated with the metric

ds2 = dt2 + t2(dx2 + dy2) + dz2.

(1)

the line element (1) presents a space-like singularity at t = 0. the scalar curvature is r =
2/t2, and consequently, the adiabatic approach [4]cannot be applied in order to dene particle
states. with the help of the hamiltonian diagonalization method [810], bukhbinder [11]
has been able to compute the rate of scalar particles produced in the space with the metric
(1), obtaining as result a bose-einstein distribution. more recently [12], a quasiclassical
approach has been applied to compute the rate of scalar as well as dirac particles in the
metric (1).

the introduction of an external electric eld permits one to consider an additional source
of quantum processes. the density of particles created by an intense electric eld was rst
calculated by schwinger [13], dierent authors [8,14] have discussed this problem. pair
creation of scalar particles by a constant electric eld in a 2+1 de sitter cosmological universe
has been analyzed by garriga [15]. quantum eects associated with scalar and spinor
particles in a quasi-euclidean cosmological model with a constant electric eld are discussed
by bukhbinder and odintsov [16]. it is the purpose of the present article to compute, via the
quasiclassical approach [1719], the density of scalar particles created in the background eld
(1) when a constant electric eld is present. the idea behind the method is the following:
first, we solve the relativistic hamilton-jacobi equation and, looking at its solutions, we
identify positive and negative frequency modes. second, we solve the klein gordon-equation

2

and, after comparing with the results obtained for the quasiclassical limit, we identify the
positive and negative frequency states. this technique has already been successfully applied
in dierent scenarios [1719].

the relativistic hamilton-jacobi equation can be written as

g(

s
x  ea)(

s
x  ea) + m2 = 0,

(2)

where here and elsewhere we adopt the convention c = 1 and h = 1.

the vector potential a

(3)
corresponds to a constant electric eld ek. the corresponding invariants f f = 2e2
and f f = 0 indicate that there is no magnetic eld. since the metric g associated
with the line element (1) only depends on t, the function s can be separated as

a = (0, 0, 0  et),

substituting (4) into (2) we obtain

s = f (t) + kxx + kyy + kzz.

f 2 =

k2
x + k2

the solution of eq. (5) presents the following asymptotic behavior:

as t  0, that is, in the initial singularity. notice that the time dependence of the relativistic
wave function is obtained via the exponential operation   exp(is). here it is worth
mentioning that the behavior of positive and negative frequency states is selected depending
on the sign of the operator it. positive frequency modes will have positive eigenvalues
and for negative frequency states we will have the opposite. then in eq. (6) and (8,7)
upper signs are associated with negative frequency values and the lower signs correspond to
positive frequency states. after making this identication we can analyze the solutions of
the klein-gordon equation in the background eld (1).

the covariant generalization of the klein-gordon equation takes the form

g(  iea)(  iea)  (m2 + r) = 0,

(9)

where  is the covariant derivative, r is the scalar curvature, and  is a dimensionless
coupling constant which takes the value  = 1/6 in the conformal case, and  = 0 when a
minimal coupling is considered. substituting (1) into (9) we obtain

(10)

since eq. (10) commutes with the linear momentum ~p = (ix,iy  iz), we have that
the substitution

 = t1(t)ei(kxx+kyy+kzz),

reduces eq (10) to the ordinary second order dierential equation.

take the form

since we have been able to obtain single particle states for in the vicinity of t = 0 as
well as in the asymptote t  , we can compute the density of particles created by the

it should be noticed that, thanks to the normalization condition, we did not have to com-
pute the normalization constants c appearing in the denition of the single mode solutions
(17,18). let us analyze the asymptotic behavior of
(23) when the electric eld vanishes.
taking into account that cosh(z)  e|z|/2 as z  , we readily obtain

n  ||2

||2 = exp(q4(2 + k2

(26)

which is the result obtained in [12]. expression (26) corresponds to a two dimensional
bose-einstein thermal distribution with an eective mass which diers from the value of
m appearing in eq. (9). in the case of strong electric elds the density number of scalar
particles created takes the form

n  ||2

(27)

showing
that the density of particles created by the cosmological background and the
electric eld (27) is a bose-einsten distribution with a chemical potential proportional to
m2
ee . integrating the particle density n (27) on momentum we obtain the total number of
particles created per unit volume.

n =

v z ndkxdkydkz =

t2(2)2 z nkdkdkz.

(28)

in order to carry out the integration we have to notice that n does not depend on kz and

consequently integration on kz is equivalent to the substitution [8,14] r dkz  eet where

t is the time of interaction of the external eld. in the strong eld limit we can approximate
the density number n (27) by the expression

n  exp(


2

tanh(



4q8  1)

m2

2q4(2 + k2

y + k2

x)  1).

(29)

substituting (29) into (28) , we obtain that the total number n of particles per unit volume
takes the form

n 

ee
84t

(b + 2) exp(b/2) exp(

m2
2ee

tanh(

)),

(30)

where b = 8  1. result (30) resembles the number of particles created by a constant
electric eld in a minkowski space [8,14].
it is worth mentioning that the number n of
particles per unit volume is inversely proportional to t 1 and vanishes as t  . the
volume expansion of the anisotropic universe (1) is faster than the particle creation process,
therefore n becomes negligible for large values of t.

the results (23) , (27), and (30) show that the anisotropic cosmological background
(1), as well the constant electric eld, contribute to the creation of scalar particles. the
quasiclassical method gives a recipe for obtaining the positive and negative frequency modes
even when spacetime is not static and an external source is present. the presence of the
anisotropy with a constant electric eld gives place to a particle distribution that is thermal
only in the asymptotic eld regime. the method and results presented in this paper could
be of help to discuss quantum eects in more realistic anisotropic cosmological scenarios.
