abstract

we use the boundary state formalism to study, from the closed string
point of view, superpositions of branes and anti-branes which are relevant in
some non-perturbative string dualities. treating the tachyon instability of
these systems as proposed by a. sen, we show how to incorporate the eects
of the tachyon condensation directly in the boundary state. in this way we
manage to show explicitly that the d1  anti-d1 pair of type i is a stable non-
bps d-particle, and compute its mass. we also generalize this construction
to describe other non-bps d-branes of type i. by requiring the absence of
tachyons in the open string spectrum, we nd which congurations are stable
and compute their tensions. our classication is in complete agreement with
the results recently obtained using the k-theory of space-time.

1 introduction

among the various string dualities, the one between the so(32) heterotic string
and the type i theory [1] is of special interest for many reasons. first of all, this
weak/strong coupling duality relates two models with radically dierent perturba-
tive expansions and spectra. secondly, an analysis of the web of string dualities
shows that all of them may be derived by combining it with t-duality [2].

the duality conjecture between the so(32) heterotic string and the type i
theory basically relies on the uniqueness of the corresponding supergravity models.
in fact, the two tree-level eective actions turn out to be related [1] through a
eld redenition which inverts the coupling constant. this duality thus identies
the weak coupling regime of one theory with the strong coupling regime of the
other. as a rst check of the conjecture, it has been shown [3] that the world-
volume theory on the d-string of type i is identical to the world-sheet theory of
the heterotic string. in particular this explains the appearance of the so(32) spinor
representation in the type i theory.

more evidence of this conjectured duality has been given in the literature, mainly
relying on the existence of bps states. as is well known, bps states form short (or
ultra-short) multiplets of the supersymmetry algebra for which the mass is related
to the charge. because of this fact they are stable and protected from radiative
corrections. hence, their properties can be analysed and computed perturbatively
at weak coupling and then reliably extrapolated at strong coupling. such tests of the
heterotic/type i duality conjecture comprise comparison between bps spectra in
the compactied theories [4], but also between bps saturated terms in the eective
actions in both the uncompactied [5] and the compactied cases [6].

however, at the rst massive level the heterotic string contains perturbative
states which are stable but not bps. their stability follows from the fact that they
are the lightest states carrying the quantum numbers of the spinor representation of
so(32). since they cannot decay, these states should be present also in the strong
coupling regime. then, if the heterotic/type i duality is correct, the type i theory
should support non-perturbative stable congurations that are spinors of so(32).
finding them and checking their multiplicities is therefore a very non-trivial test
on the heterotic/type i duality.

it turns out [7] that a pair formed by a d1-brane and an anti d1-brane of type
i (wrapped on a circle and with a z2 wilson line) describes a conguration with
the quantum numbers of the spinor representation of so(32) (for reviews see [8]).
thus this system is the right candidate to describe in the non-perturbative regime
the stable non-bps states of the heterotic string mentioned above. however, a
superposition of a brane with an anti-brane is unstable due to the presence of

1

tachyons in the open strings stretching between the brane and the anti-brane [9].
then the problem of dening properly this superposition and treating its tachyon
instability arises. this has been addressed by a. sen in a remarkable series of papers
[10, 11, 7, 12, 13]. in particular in ref. [7] he considered a d-string  anti d-string
pair of type iib, and managed to prove that when the tachyon condenses to a
kink along the compact direction of the d-string, the pair becomes tightly bound
and, as a whole, behaves as a d-particle. he also computed its mass nding that
it is a factor of 2 bigger than the one of the supersymmetric bps d-particle of
the type iia theory. the presence of a d-particle in the type iib spectrum looks
surprising at rst sight since one usually thinks that in type iib there are only
dp-branes with p odd. however, one should keep in mind that such a d-particle is
a non-supersymmetric and non-bps conguration. furthermore it is unstable, due
to the fact that there are tachyons in the spectrum of the open strings living on
its world-line. these tachyons turn out to be odd under the world-sheet parity ,
and hence disappear if one performs the  projection to get the type i string [14].
therefore, the d-particle found by sen is a stable non-perturbative conguration
of type i that transforms as a spinor of so(32).

in this paper we analyze the type i d-particle from the point of view of the
closed string operator formalism, and construct its representation in terms of a
boundary state [15, 16]. the boundary state approach is a very convenient and
useful method to describe bps d-branes, nd their couplings with the various
closed string elds [17] and also determine their interactions (for some applications
of the boundary state see for example refs. [18, 19, 20]).
in refs. [11, 21], it
was shown that the boundary state formalism can also be applied successfully to
describe non-bps congurations in certain orbifold models.

here, we use this approach to study the superposition of a d-string and an anti
d-string in the type iib theory, and construct the corresponding boundary state
with the proper normalization. then, extending sens arguments, we manage to
incorporate the eects of the tachyon condensation directly in the boundary state,
and show explicitly that at a particular value of the tachyon v.e.v. this boundary
state describes a non-bps d-particle. moreover, we show that the same result
can be achieved by means of a suitable discrete transformation which eectively
accounts for the tachyon condensation on the initial d-string  anti d-string pair.
using this construction we can also compute directly the mass of the non-bps
d-particle nding agreement with sens result.

in the closed string operator formalism, the  projection that reduces type
iib to type i is implemented by adding to the boundary state of type ii the
crosscap state [22, 16] which is uniquely determined by the requirement of tadpole
cancellation. in this way one obtains an eective boundary state for the type i

2

d-branes which can be eciently used to study their properties and interactions.
applying this procedure to the non-bps d-particle, we construct its corresponding
boundary state of type i and use it to check its stability by showing that no tachyon
poles develop in the open string vacuum amplitude at one loop.

this construction can be easily generalized to describe other non-bps d-branes
of type i. in particular, by requiring the absence of tachyons in the open string
spectrum, we determine which of these type i congurations are stable and compute
their tensions. our classication is in complete agreement with the results recently
obtained by e. witten [23] and others [24, 25] using the k-theory of space-time.
other recent papers discussing related subjects are [26, 27, 28].

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we briey review the boundary
state formalism and specify our notations; in section 3, we derive the boundary
state for the type iib d-particle as a bound state of d-strings. in section 4 we
perform the  projection on the boundary state to describe the d-particle of the
type i theory, and explicitly verify its stability. in section 5 we generalize these
results to construct the boundary state for non-bps dp-branes of type i and discuss
for which values of p the tachyon cancellation condition can be satised. finally, a
few more technical calculations are reported in two appendices.

2 the boundary state formalism

in the closed string operator formalism one describes the supersymmetric dp-branes
of type ii by means of boundary states |dpi [15, 16]. these are closed string
states which insert a boundary on the world-sheet, enforce on it the appropriate
boundary conditions and represent the source for the closed strings emitted by the
branes [17]. in the fermionic string, both in the ns-ns and in the r-r sectors,
there are two possible implementations for the boundary conditions of a dp-brane
which correspond to two boundary states |dp,i. however, only the combinations
(2.1)

1

|dpins =

(2.2)

and

|dpir =

2h|dp, +ins  |dp,insi
2h|dp, +ir + |dp,iri

1

are selected by the gso projection in the ns-ns and in the r-r sectors respectively.
as discussed in ref. [19], the boundary states |dp,i can be written as the product
of a matter part and a ghost part

|dp,i =

tp
2 |dpmat,i|dpg,i ,

(2.3)

3

where

|dpmat,i = |dpxi|dp,i

,

|dpg,i = |dpghi|dpsgh,i .

(2.4)

the overall normalization tp can be unambiguously xed from the factorization of
amplitudes of closed strings emitted from a disk [29, 17] and is related to the brane
tension p [30] according to

tp = p 10 = (cid:16)2(cid:17)3p

(2.5)

where 10 is the gravitational coupling constant in ten dimensions. the explicit
expressions of the various components of |dp,i, together with their derivation,
can be found for example in ref. [19]. here we just recall the structure of the matter
part of the boundary state 1, namely

and

xn=1

n  s(p)  n(cid:21)|dp,i(0)

,

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

for the r-r sector. the matrix s(p) encodes the boundary conditions which char-
acterize the d-brane; in the case of a static brane without any external elds one
simply has

s(p)
 = (,ij)

(2.9)

where the indices ,  label the (p + 1) longitudinal directions of the world-volume,
and the indices i, j label the (9  p) transverse directions. finally, the superscript
(0) in eqs. (2.6) and (2.8) denotes the zero-mode contributions to the boundary
state. these are

(2.10)

(2.11)

|dpxi(0) = (9p)(qi  yi)

9y=0|k = 0i

where yi are the coordinates of the d-brane and |ki is the fock vacuum of mo-
mentum k, and

|dp,i(0)

r =(cid:18)c0 . . . p 1  i11

1  i (cid:19)ab |ai| bi

1the ghost and superghost parts will not play any signicant role in our present analysis and

thus we omit them to avoid clutter.

4

where |ai and | bi are the left and right spinor vacua of the r sector in the 32-
dimensional majorana representation 2.
both in the ns-ns and in the r-r sectors, the two boundary states |dp,i are
mapped into each other by the world-sheet fermion number operators (1)f and
(1)ef . in particular, in the ns-ns sector one can show that

(1)f |dp, +ins = (1)ef |dp, +ins = |dp,ins

(2.12)

measure the chirality of the spinor vacua, one has [19, 17]

where, as usual, we have taken the ns-ns vacuum to be odd under (1)f and
(1)ef . similarly, in the r-r sector, where the fermion number operators also
(1)f |dp, +ir = (1)p |dp,ir

(2.13)

,

(1)ef |dp, +ir = |dp,ir .

these relations become useful when one performs the gso projection. for example,
in the ns-ns sector where the gso projector is

pgso =

1 + (1)f

2

1 + (1)ef

2

,

one simply has

|dpins  pgso |dp, +ins =

1

2h|dp, +ins  |dp,insi ,

(2.14)

(2.15)

i.e. eq. (2.1). for the r-r sector, one has to remember that the boundary states are
written in the left-right asymmetric superghost picture (1/2,3/2) (see ref. [19]
for details) in which the appropriate gso projector takes the form

pgso =

1 + (1)p (1)f

2

1 + (1)ef

2

(2.16)

where p is even for type iia and odd for type iib in accordance with the r-r
charge carried by a dp-brane. then, using eq. (2.13), we easily see that the gso
projected boundary state in the r-r sector is

|dpir  pgso |dp, +ir =

1

2h|dp, +ir + |dp,iri ,

(2.17)

i.e. eq. (2.2). this analysis shows that it is enough to consider the boundary states
|dp, +ins and |dp, +ir from which the complete boundary states are obtained by
means of the gso projection. finally, we recall that an anti dp-brane is a brane
with negative r-r charge, and in our formalism it is simply described by a boundary
state with an overall minus sign in the r-r sector.

2we refer to refs. [19, 17] for the conventions on spinors and  matrices.

5

let us now consider the case in which the p longitudinal space directions are
compactied on circles of radii r. the boundary state for a wrapped dp-brane is
still given by the previous expressions with only two changes. the rst (and easiest)
one is in |dpxi(0) which becomes

|dpxi(0) = (9p)(qi  yi)|k0 = 0i

py=1xw |n = 0, wi

9yi=p+1|ki = 0i

(2.18)

where |n, wi is the bosonic vacuum with kaluza-klein index n and winding num-
ber w. t-duality invariance requires that these vacuum states must be normalized
as

hn, w|n, wi =  nnww

(2.19)

where  is the self-dual volume of a compact direction 3 which satises the fol-
lowing properties

  2r for r   ,  

2

r

for r  0 .

(2.20)

as a consequence of this fact, a second (and less obvious) change occurs in the
boundary state of a wrapped d-brane. indeed, as shown in ref. [29], the overall
normalization factor tp in eq. (2.3) must be replaced by

tp (cid:18)2r

 (cid:19)p/2

.

(2.21)

then, it is easy to check that the boundary state dened in this way correctly
reproduces the vacuum amplitude for a wrapped dp-brane, normalization factors
included.

we conclude this brief summary by mentioning that in the boundary state for-
malism the incorporation of u(1) wilson lines for wrapped d-branes amounts sim-
ply to introduce in eq. (2.18) appropriate phases in the sum over all winding num-
bers of the compact directions, so that |dpxi(0) becomes

|dpxi(0) = (9p)(qi  yi)|k0 = 0i

py=1xw

ei w

|n = 0, wi

9yi=p+1|ki = 0i (2.22)

where the constants  parametrize the wilson lines associated with the u(1) gauge
elds living on the d-brane world-volume [32, 29].

3the explicit expression of  as well as a detailed discussion of its properties can be found for

example in ref. [31].

3 the type iib d-particle as a bound state of

d-strings

following ref. [7], we now study the type iib system formed by the superposition
of a d-string and an anti d-string, both wrapped on a circle of radius r and with a
z2 wilson line on one of them, say for deniteness on the anti d-string. to describe
this system we introduce the following boundary states

|b, +ins  |d1, +ins + |d1, +ins
|b, +ir  |d1, +ir  |d1, +ir

(3.1)

(3.2)

where the  indicates the presence of the z2 wilson line (i.e.  = 1 in the notation
of eq. (2.22)). note that the minus sign in eq. (3.2) accounts for the fact that one
of the two members of the pair is an anti d-string. using the explicit expressions
reported in section 2, we have

|b, +ins =

where we have denoted by s(1) the d-string s-matrix for all non-compact directions
and have separately indicated in the second line the contribution of the bosonic and

fermionic non-zero modes of the compact direction (i.e. the modes of x,  and e).
due to the presence of the z2 wilson line, the vacuum |ins is given by

|ins = (8)(qi)|k0 = 0i xw |0, wi +xw

= 2 (8)(qi)|k0 = 0ixw |0, 2wi

(1)w|0, wi! 9yi=2|ki = 0i
9yi=2|ki = 0i

(3.4)

where for simplicity we have set to zero the coordinates yi of the d-strings. analo-
gously, in the r-r sector we have

(3.6)

let us now suppose that the radius r of the compact direction x is given by

rc =s 

2

.

(3.7)

as shown in ref. [7], at this particular value of the radius all excitations of the open
strings stretched between the d-string and the anti d-string have non negative mass
squared. moreover, at r = rc the bosonic coordinate x is equivalent to a pair of
fermionic elds  and . indeed, if we write

x(z, z) =

1

(xl(z) + xr(z))

xl(z) = ql  i(2)pl ln z + i2xn6=0

by recombining the fermions ,  and  (and e, e and e) in a dierent manner, we

can obtain an equivalent representation of the same conformal eld theory in terms
of a new compact bosonic eld

(3.12)

(3.13)

the eld (z, z) is a free boson of radius r = rc which has a mode expansion
similar to the one of the original coordinate x(z, z) (i.e. eqs. (3.9) and (3.10))
with oscillators n and n, and with kaluza-klein and winding numbers n and w
respectively.

as emphasized in ref. [7], if one uses the new elds  and  instead of the
original x and , it is possible to study explicitly the eects of a non vanishing
v.e.v.
for tachyon of the open string stretched beween the d-string and the anti
d-string. in fact, in the 0 superghost picture such a tachyon is described by the
following vertex operator

v (z) =

i
2

(z)  1

(3.14)

where we have denoted by (z) the open string eld corresponding to eq. (3.12)
and by 1 the chan-paton factor appropriate for an open string stretched across
the d-string  anti d-string pair [7]. as a matter of fact, the vertex operator (3.14)
does not represent a true tachyon since it creates a state which, at the critical
radius r = rc, is massless. however, since such a state becomes tachyonic in the
decompactication limit r  , the eld associated to eq. (3.14) is, nevertheless,
called tachyon. from the explicit expression of v (z), we easily see that giving a
non vanishing v.e.v. to the tachyon eld is equivalent to introducing a u(1) wilson
line along , which we can parametrize as follows

w() =

1
2

tr"exp  

2i dz

i
2

  1!# .

since in a pure closed string amplitude there are no other sources of chan-paton
factors, eq. (3.15) simplies to

(3.15)

(3.16)

w() = cos  w
2 !

where w is the total winding number of the closed string state seen by the operator
w().

we are now in the position of writing the boundary state which describes the
d-string  anti d-string pair in the presence of a non vanishing tachyon v.e.v. this
is given by eqs. (3.3) and (3.5) with the oscillators n, n, r, r of the compact
direction replaced by n, n, r and r, and with a vacuum that carries an explicit
dependence on the parameter  according to eq. (3.16). in particular, in the ns-ns
sector we have

notice that at  = 0 the boundary states (3.17) and (3.19) are completely equivalent
to the original ones written in eqs. (3.3) and (3.5), as one can check for example by
computing some correlation functions or the vacuum amplitude. in this respect, it is
worth pointing out that in computing amplitudes with |b(), +ins and |b(), +ir,
in fact, this
one has to be careful in performing correctly the gso projection.
is not obtained by taking linear combinations as in eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), since the

operators (1)f and (1)ef are not related to the  and  fermion numbers. instead,

as is clear from eq. (3.13), in the ns-ns sector one has

and similarly for (1)f on the left moving oscillators. using these rules, one can
easily see, for example, that

(3.22)

notice that the action of the operator (1)ef on the bosonic eld  given in

eq. (3.21) looks like a t-duality because it amounts to change the relative sign

10

between its left and right moving oscillators. however, since the compactication
radius of  is such that

rc =

(3.23)


2rc

this change in sign implies that a state with kaluza-klein index n and winding
number w is transformed into a state with kaluza-klein index w/2 (which is
acceptable only when w is even) and winding number 2n, that is

:

|n, wi  |

, 2ni .

(3.24)

(1)ef

this peculiar behavior explains the structure of the vacuum in eq. (3.22). of course,
similar considerations apply also for the boundary states in the r-r sector.

let us now turn to the vacuum amplitude of the theory dened on the world-
volume of our d-string  anti d-string pair. in the boundary state formalism this
amplitude is simply given by

a() = hb(), +| pgso d |b(), +i

(3.25)

where the gso projection operator is given in eqs. (2.14) and (2.16), and d is the
closed string propagator

it is interesting to observe that the contribution of the ns-ns(1)f spin struc-
ture (i.e. the second term in eq. (3.27)) does not depend on the tachyon v.e.v.
. this is a direct consequence of the fact that this spin structure arises from
the overlap between |b(), +ins, whose vacuum contains states with only winding
numbers, and (1)ef|b(), +ins, whose vacuum instead contains states with only
kaluza-klein numbers (see eqs. (3.18) and (3.22)). therefore, in the ns-ns(1)f
spin structure there is no contribution from the bosonic zero modes of the compact
direction , and hence no dependence on the tachyon v.e.v. .

if one performs the modular transformation t  /t, the entire amplitude a()
can be interpreted as the one-loop vacuum energy of the open strings living in the
world-volume of the d-string  anti d-string pair. after this modular transforma-
tion, one can explicitly check that a() in eq. (3.25) coincides with the annulus
amplitude that follows from the rules described in ref. [7] from the open string
point of view (see appendix a for some details). in particular, one sees that the
-independent ns-ns(1)f spin structure of the closed string channel goes into the
r spin structure of the open string channel, that indeed has been shown in ref. [7]
to be independent of the tachyon v.e.v.

at  = 1 a remarkable simplication occurs: the r-r contribution to a vanishes,
since, as is clear from eq. (3.20), the r-r boundary state is null at  = 1. thus,
the entire vacuum amplitude becomes

underlying structure may actually exist at  = 1, in accordance with the property,
shown in ref. [7], that at this value of the tachyon v.e.v. the d-string  anti d-string
pair is most tightly bound and, as a whole, behaves like a d-particle. indeed, our
expectation is conrmed by the fact that the amplitude a( = 1) can be factorized

of course, the simple factorization of a vacuum amplitude does not allow to uniquely
x the structure of a boundary state, and thus one may think that there is some
arbitrariness in eq. (3.33). however, a detailed analysis of correlation functions

shows that the new boundary state |eb, +i, which is written in terms of the original

degrees of freedom for the compact direction (i.e. x and ), is equivalent to the
boundary state of eq. (3.17) for  = 1. to see this, one considers closed string vertex
operators written in terms of x and  and computes the corresponding correlation

functions on a disk using the boundary state |eb, +i; then, transforming (x, )
into (, ) through the bosonization formulas, one checks that the same correlation
functions are obtained with the boundary state |b( = 1), +i given in eq. (3.17).
a few examples of such calculations are explicitly described in appendix b.

based on these results, we can conclude that in order to describe the d-string
 anti d-string pair at r = rc in terms of x and , we have to use the original
boundary states of eqs. (3.3) and (3.5) if  = 0, whereas we have to use the the new
boundary state of eq. (3.33) if  = 1. of course, at this particular value of  there is
no r-r sector, as we have explicitly shown. it is interesting to observe that |b, +ins
and |eb, +i can be related to each other by means of a discrete transformation t .
indeed, as is clear from eqs. (3.3) and (3.33), we may go from |b, +ins to |eb, +i
by changing the sign to the right moving oscillators of the compact direction, and
consequently by changing the vacuum from |0, 2wi to |w, 0i since the radius of x
satises eq. (3.23) (cf also eq. (3.24)). like the usual t-duality, also t transforms
a longitudinal direction into a transverse one, so that the new boundary state |eb, +i
more properly describes a d0-brane with a compact transverse direction. however,
unlike t-duality, t switches o the r-r sector. this fact suggests that, more than
a symmetry of the theory, this transformation t has to be regarded simply as an
eective way of implementing the change of the tachyon v.e.v. from  = 0 to  = 1

13

on the original boundary states, which can be justied by introducing the new elds
 and  through the bosonization procedure as we have done.

in ref. [7] it was shown that the decompactication limit r   of the d-string
 anti d-string pair is meaningful only at  = 1, where the system is most tightly
bound and no tadpoles develop. in our formalism, this feature is revealed by the fact
the limit r   is ill-dened on the original boundary states |b, +ins and |b, +ir
since their vacuum contains only a subset of all possible winding states, namely the
states with only even or odd winding numbers respectively in the ns-ns and r-r
sectors. on the contrary, there are no problems in taking the decompactication

limit on the new boundary state |eb, +i which describes the theory at  = 1. in
fact, when r   we can rewrite eq. (3.34) as follows
2 |k1i

9yi=2|ki = 0i

|ei = 2 (8)(qi)|k0 = 0i 2rz dk1
9y=0|k = 0i

= 4r (9)(qi)

(3.35)

which resembles eq. (2.10) for p = 0. furthermore, combining the factor of 4r

from eq. (3.35) with the prefactors of |eb, +i, we see that the complete normalization

of the boundary state becomes

t1

2 s

2 t1 (2)

2 t0

(3.36)

where we have used the asymptotic behavior of  for r   (see eq. (2.20)) and
the explicit expression of the tensions tp (see eq. (2.5)). thus, in the decompacti-
cation limit our system is described by

by performing the usual gso projection, we then obtain the complete boundary

|ebi  pgso |eb, +i =

2h|eb, +i  |eb,ii

(3.38)

which describes a d0-brane in the type iib theory. since there is no r-r sector,
this d-particle is non-supersymmetric and non-bps. moreover, from eq. (3.37) we
explicitly see that its tension (or mass) is a factor of 2 bigger than the tension of
the ordinary supersymmetric d-particle of the type iia theory. this fact has been
proved and checked also in ref. [7] using completely dierent arguments.

14

4 the boundary state for the type i d-particle

the non-supersymmetric d-particle described in the previous section is an unstable
conguration of the type iib theory. in fact, the absence of the r-r part in the

d-particle boundary state |ebi implies the absence of any gso projection in the

dual open string theory dened on its world-line. thus, the spectrum of these
open strings contains not only the states that a supersymmetric d-particle would
sustain, but also all other states that are usually removed by the gso projection.
in particular in the ns sector, one nds a tachyonic state which is responsible for
the instability of the entire conguration. however, things might improve if there
is a consistent truncation of the theory which is free of tachyons. one possibility
is to study our system in the type i theory, which can be viewed as an orbifold of
the type iib theory with respect to the world-sheet parity  4. to see whether or
not the open string tachyon is removed by the  projection, we have to analyze the
interaction amplitude of the d-particle with itself due to the exchange of unoriented
strings. to this end, we follow the general procedure discussed in ref. [22, 16], and

add to the boundary state |ebi the so-called crosscap state |ci which inserts a

boundary on the string world-sheet with opposite points being identied. thus, we
consider

1

2h|ebi + |cii ,

|gd0i 

(4.1)
where the factor of 1/2 has been introduced to have the proper normalization.
like for a usual boundary, also for a crosscap there are two possible implemen-
tations of the overlap equations that correspond to two states |c,i. however,
only a linear combination of them is selected by the gso projection. since for the
case at hand the r-r sector does not play any role, we will concentrate only in the
ns-ns sector where one nds

|ci = pgso|c, +ins =

1

2h|c, +ins  |c,insi .

example ref. [16].

15

where s(9)
 = , t9 is given in eq. (2.5) for p = 9 and the overall factor of i has
been introduced for later convenience. like the d9-brane, also the crosscap is a
source for the non-trivial 10-form potential of type i theory [16], and indeed the
crosscap state |ci is strictly related to the boundary state of a d9 brane with a
pure imaginary radius; in fact one has

|ci  il0+ l0|d9i .

(4.4)

this remark will prove to be useful for technical purposes. an important point
we want to stress is that the normalization of the crosscap state in eq. (4.3) is
completely xed by the requirement of tadpole cancellation of the type i theory
[16].

we are now ready to study the interaction of a d-particle with itself. this
is due to exchange of closed strings that propagate along a cylinder between two

|gd0i states. this amplitude comprises three types of contributions. the rst one
is with two boundaries and corresponds to a cylinder amplitude which is given
2heb|d|ebi. notice that this amplitude is half of the corresponding one
by a = 1
in the type iib theory. the second type of contribution is with one boundary
and one crosscap and corresponds to a mobius strip amplitude which is given by
2heb|d|ci. of course, one has to consider also the conjugate expression
m = 1
2hc|d|ebi where the crosscap and the boundary have exchanged place.
m = 1
finally, the third type of contribution is with two crosscaps and corresponds to the
klein bottle amplitude given by k = 1
2hc|p|ci. this last contribution does not
contain open string poles and refers only to the propagation of unoriented closed
strings. for these reasons we shall not consider it in our analysis.

using the explicit expressions for the boundary and the crosscap states, we nd

that the cylinder amplitude is

(4.6)

a remark is in order here. since the crosscap state is related to the boundary state
of a d9 brane as we have seen in eq. (4.4), the mobius amplitude corresponds to
a system with one nn direction and nine dn directions which cannot be studied
in the light cone gauge. hence in this case, the use of a covariant formalism is
necessary.

16

to obtain the open string channel, we must perform the modular transformation
t  1/t in the previous expressions so that a and m become the planar and non-
planar one-loop amplitudes of the open strings living on the d-particle world-line.
the rules for the modular transformations of the functions fk with a real argument
are well known (see for example ref. [30]). the analogous rules for a pure imaginary
argument are instead less known, and thus we list them below

4s ) ,

f1(i es) = (2s)1/2f1(i e 
f2(i es) = f2(i e

f3(i es) = ei/8f4(i e 
f4(i es) = ei/8f3(i e

(4.7)

these results for f1 and f2 may be obtained using the rules of modular transforma-
tion for fk(es) and elementary algebraic manipulations. in order to x the phases
appearing in the transformation rules of f3 and f4 we have used eulers pentagonal
identity.

performing the modular transformation, we then obtain

ns+(r) and zi

notice that both zi
ns(r) are real. the reason to introduce these
quantities is that they can be interpreted as the partition functions in the various
sectors of the open strings suspended between two type i d-particles. to see this,
we rely on the analysis of ref. [12] where the rules for the interactions of these
open strings are specied and shown to be consistent. let us briey recall the main
points of this analysis that are relevant for our purposes.
in the ns sector, the
world-sheet fermion number f acts in the usual manner both on the oscillators
and on the fock vacuum which is taken to be odd under (1)f . the world-sheet
parity  has the following action on the various string oscillators (see for example
ref. [33])


n  ein

n

, 

r  eir

r

(4.15)

where the upper (lower) sign holds for nn (dd) directions. the action of  on the
fock vacuum in the odd (1)f ns sector is taken to be

|0i(odd) = |0i(odd)

,

(4.16)

while for the even (1)f ns sector, where the states contain an odd number of
fermionic oscillators under which  acts as i, it is taken to be

|0i(even) = i|0i(even)

.

(4.17)

according to these rules, it is not dicult to show that the expressions in eqs.
(4.12) and (4.13) may be reinterpreted as

ns(r) = trns r(2l01) 1  (1)f

2

zi

1 + 

2 ! ,

(4.18)

thus proving our previous statement. similarly, in the r sector one can show that

zi

r(r) =

1
2

trr(cid:16)r2l0(cid:17) = trr(cid:18)r2l0 1 + 

2 (cid:19) ,

(4.19)

where in the last step we have used the fact that  acts as a product of  matrices on

the spinor r vacuum, so that trr(cid:16)r2l0(cid:17) vanishes due to the presence of fermionic

zero-modes.

using these results, we can conclude that the total amplitude (4.11) is

ds
2s

s1/2(cid:20)trns(cid:18)r(2l01) 1 + 

2 (cid:19)  trr(cid:18)r2l0 1 + 

2 (cid:19)(cid:21) ,

aopen = 2 v (82)1/2z 

0

(4.20)
which is the one-loop vacuum energy of unoriented open strings without any gso
projection. despite this fact, there is no instability in the system because the 
projection removes the tachyon from the spectrum. this can be seen from the

18

ns(r) corresponding to the odd (1)f ns sector to which
explicit expression of zi
the tachyon belongs. indeed, by expanding eq. (4.12) in powers of r, one nds that

zi
ns(r) = o(r)

(4.21)

which shows that the coecient of the term r1 associated with the tachyon is
vanishing. notice that for this compensation to occur, it is crucial that the tension
of the d-particle is xed at the precise value 2 t0. therefore, this analysis provides
a further check of the extra factor of 2 found in ref. [7].

the massless states in the spectrum of the open strings living on the type i
d-particle account for its degeneracy. to count such zero-modes, we can use the
explicit expressions for the partition functions zi
r that we have previously
derived. eq. (4.21) shows that there are no massless states in the (1)f odd part
of the ns sector. on the contrary, the (1)f even part of the ns sector contains
nine bosonic zero-modes, as we can see by expanding eq. (4.22) in powers of r:

ns and zi

zi
ns+(r) = 9 + o(r) .

(4.22)

these nine massless modes correspond to the freedom of translating the d-particle
along its nine transverse directions. finally, from eq. (4.14) we see that the r
sector contains eight non-chiral fermionic zero-modes which upon quantization lead
to a 28 = 256 degeneracy for the d-particle, as it should be expected for a non-bps
multiplet of the n=1 supersymmetry algebra in ten dimensions.

we conclude by mentioning that the d-particle is a completely stable cong-
uration of the type i theory because no tachyons develop in the spectrum of the
open strings stretching between the d-particle and the thirty-two d9-branes which
form the background.
in the boundary state formalism, this can be checked by

evaluating the amplitude heb|d|d9i and performing the modular transformation to
obtain the open string channel. the absence of these tachyons is also clear from the
evaluation of the intercept for the open strings in the ns sector which is ans = 1
2  
8
where  is the number of mixed dirichlet-neumann directions. in the case at hand,
 = 9 and the intercept ans is strictly negative so that the ns sector contains only
massive modes. as usual, there are no problems from the r sector which contains
both massless and massive modes, the former accounting for the so(32) spinor
representation carried by the non-bps d-particle.

5 stable dp-branes in the type i theory

in the previous sections we have shown that in the type iib theory there is a

non-supersymmetric d-particle whose boundary state |ebi does not have any r-r

19

part. this unstable conguration of type iib becomes stable if one performs the 
projection to obtain the type i theory. in this section we want to see whether this
construction can be generalized to investigate the possibility that other non-bps
but stable dp-branes exist in type i.

in order to cancel the r-r part in a boundary state the obvious thing to do is
to consider a superposition of a p-brane with an anti p-brane (or p-brane for short),
and thus consider the boundary state

|gbpi = |dpi + |d pi

(5.1)

which clearly has only the ns-ns component. since we are in a type iib context,
p has to be odd. as is well known [9], this conguration is unstable due to the
presence of tachyons in the open strings stretching between the brane and the anti
brane. to see whether or not these tachyons disappear in the type i theory, we
have to study their behavior under the world-sheet parity . to this end, we rst
recall that  does not change the r-r charge of a dp-brane if p = 1, 5, 9, whereas
it reverses its sign if p = 1, 3, 7. thus we have the following rules

(p) = p , (p) = p

(5.2)

for p = 1, 5, 9, and

(p) = p , (p) = p

(5.3)
for p = 1, 3, 7. the tachyons we are concerned about, are (1)f odd states in
the p-p and p-p sectors of the open strings living on the brane world-volume. the
vacuum states out of which they are constructed are therefore

|0ipp = |0i  pp

and

|0ipp = |0i  pp

(5.4)

where |0i is the ns fock vacuum in the 1 superghost picture, and pp and pp are
the chan-paton factors which label all states of the p-p and p-p sectors respectively.
the operator  acts on the fock vacuum in the usual manner, i.e. |0i = i|0i.
the action of  on the chan-paton factors is instead more subtle and is given by

 pp 1 = p (p)(p)

(5.5)

where p is a suitable phase. from eq. (5.2), we see that for p = 1, 5, 9,  maps pp
into pp and vice versa. since  relates the p-p and the p-p sectors, it cannot be used
to remove the tachyons, and thus we conclude that for p = 1, 5, 9, the p-p system
described by the boundary state (5.1) does not yield any stable conguration.

things are dierent if p = 1, 3, 7. in this case, eq. (5.3) shows that  does not
exchange pp and pp; furthermore using the arguments of refs. [33], one can prove

20

9p

11p

2 , so that the states |0ipp and
that the intrisic phase of eq. (5.5) is p = (i)
. since 2 = 1, it is conceivable
|0ipp are eigenstates of  with eigenvalues (i)
that the  projection can eliminate the tachyons and stabilize the p-p systems when
p = 1, 3, 7 [23].

as we have seen in section 3, there is a less obvious way to remove the r-r part
of a boundary state, namely by considering the superposition of a brane and an anti-
brane in the presence of a z2 wilson line [7]. the boundary state corresponding to
this conguration is

2

|dpi + |d p i

(5.6)

where p is odd, and the  denotes the wilson line on the anti brane. as we have
seen, the r-r part of this superposition does not trivially vanish, but after tachyon
condensation it does. the resulting conguration is an unstable d(p  1)-brane of
the type iib theory whose boundary state is related to the combination eq. (5.6)
by the discrete transformation t described in section 3 and contains only a ns-
ns component. the instability of these even d-branes is due to the presence of
tachyons in the spectrum of the open strings living in their world-volume. for
simplicity, we refer to these strings as the p-p strings (where now p is even!). the
tachyons are then in the (1)f odd part of the spectrum of the p-p strings, and
are constructed from a vacuum which we denote by |0i(odd)
. to decide about the
fate of such tachyons in the type i theory, we have to dene the action of  on
the spectrum of the p-p strings.  acts as usual on the oscillators (see eq. (4.15)),
whereas, using the arguments of ref. [33] one can show that

pp

|0i(odd)

pp = (i)

p

2 |0i(odd)

pp

.

(5.7)

from this equation, we see that for p = 2, 6, 2 = 1 on the vacuum, and hence
the operator (1 + )/2 cannot be used to truncate the spectrum and remove the
tachyons. on the contrary, there are no obstructions in performing the  projection
in the other cases, i.e. p = 0, 4, 8.

this analysis leads us to consider only the type iib non-bps dp-branes with
p = 1, 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, since these are the only ones that in principle can become
stable in type i. correspondingly, for these values of p we consider gso projected
boundary states |gbpi that contain only a ns-ns part and are given by

(5.8)

where

2(cid:16)|gbp, +i  |gbp,i(cid:17)

|gbpi =
|gbp,i =

ptp

2

|dpmat,ins

(5.9)

in the notation of section 2. in this last equation we have introduced a positive
parameter p to renormalize the brane tension, which will be xed later by imposing

21

the stability condition, i.e. by requiring the cancellation of tachyons in the type i
theory.

we now proceed as in section 4: we rst add to the boundary state |gbpi the
crosscap state |ci

|gdpi =

1

2h|gbpi + |cii ,

(5.10)

(5.11)

and then study the interaction amplitude corresponding to the exchange of closed

strings between two |gdpi states. for our purposes, we consider only the contribu-

tions with open string poles, namely the cylinder amplitude and the mobius strip
amplitude given by

1

a =

2 hgbp|d|gbpi and m =

2 hgbp|d|ci .

(5.18)

from this table we see that there exist two even non-bps but stable dp-branes:
the d-particle and the d8-brane [23]. both of them have a tension that is a factor
of 2 bigger than the corresponding branes of the type iia theory. this is in
agreement with the result of the explicit construction presented in sections 3 and
4. moreover, there exist two odd non-bps but stable dp-branes: the d-instanton
and the d7-brane [23]. their tension is twice the one of the corresponding type
iib branes, in accordance with the fact that they can be simply interpreted as the
superposition of a brane with an anti brane, so that the r-r part of the boundary
state cancels while the ns-ns part doubles.

it is interesting to see what happens in this construction if one performs the
 projection by using a symplectic crosscap state instead of the orthogonal one
considered so far. this would correspond to quantize the thirty-two d9-branes
of the background with symplectic rather than orthogonal chan-paton factors, a
procedure which is known not to be fully consistent but which can nevertheless
be considered up to some extent [23]. in this case everything proceeds as before,
except that the mobius strip contributions have a dierent sign. thus the tachyon
cancellation condition (5.17) gets replaced by

p = 2 sin(


4

) .

(5.19)

since p has to be positive, this equation has solution only if p = 3, 4, in which case

23

we get

(5.20)

the classication of the stable non-bps d-branes of type i based on tables (5.18)
and (5.20) is in complete agreement with the results of refs. [23, 24, 25] derived
from the k-theory of space-time.

we end by observing that actually only the d-instanton and the d-particle are
fully stable congurations of the type i theory. in fact, in all other cases there are
tachyons that develop in the spectrum of the open strings ending on the thirty-two
d9-branes that form the type i background. it would be very interesting to study
and analyze in more detail the properties and the interactions of these non-bps
but stable d-branes. we hope that the boundary state formalism discussed in this
paper might be useful for this purpose.

appendix a

in this appendix we compute the partition function of the open strings living on
the world-wolume of the d-string  anti d-string pair dened in section 3 at the

critical radius rc =q/2 and for a generic value  of the tachyon v.e.v. we present
our calculation in the type iib theory. this open string partition function can be
obtained by performing a modular transformation t  1/t on the amplitudes (3.27)
and (3.28) that we computed using the boundary state formalism. as usual, in going
from the open to the closed string channel we obtain the following identication of
the various sectors: the ns sector of the open string comes from the ns-ns sector
of the closed string, the ns()f from the r-r and the r from the ns-ns()f .
performing the modular transformation on the sum of eqs. (3.27) and (3.28), after

24

with r = es. notice that zr(r; ) is actually independent of . eqs. (a.2) and
(a.3) are precisely the open string partition functions in the ns and r sectors that
can be evaluated from the rules given in ref. [7]. in particular, the r sector partition
function (a.3) is obtained using as degrees of freedom for the compact direction the
elds (, ) dened in section 3.
in this representation, the contribution of the
compactied direction is that of a boson with mixed neumann-dirichlet boundary
conditions (yielding the f4 in the denominator of eq. (a.3)) and of a ns fermion
(yielding the f3 in the numerator). being independent of  this partition function
can also be computed at  = 0 using the original (x, ) degrees of freedom. in this
representation we have the contribution of a compactied boson and of a ramond
fermion so that

zr(r; ) =xn

the equality between eqs. (a.3) and (a.4) is ensured by the identities (3.31).

partition function which becomes

(a.5)

eqs. (a.5) and (a.4) are the partition functions of an open string in the ns and r
sectors without any gso projection.

appendix b

in this appendix we show that the boundary state |eb, +i given in eq. (3.33) is
equivalent to the boundary state |b(), +ins given in eq. (3.17) for  = 1. to
prove this equivalence we consider a few closed string states and check that they
have the same overlap with both |eb, +i and |b( = 1), +ins. since the dierence

between these two boundary states is only in the compact direction, in the following
we will focus only on its contribution and understand all the rest.

we begin with the following state

|i = |n = 1, w = 0i + |n = 1, w = 0i

which is created by the vertex operator

w(z, z) = e

i

2

[xl(z)+xr(z)] + e i
2

[xl(z)+xr(z)]

.

(b.1)

(b.2)

when we saturate the boundary state |eb, +i with |i, we obtain
where we have used eq. (2.19) and absorbed in n all factors coming from the
normalization of the boundary state and from the contributions of non-compact
directions.

h|eb, +i = 2n 

(b.3)

to compute the overlap between |i and |b(), +ins, we have rst to nd the
representation of |i in terms of the elds (, ). to this end, we use the bosoniza-
tion formulas of section 3 to write the vertex operator w as follows

w(z, z) = i (z) (z) 

1

2(cid:26)e

i

2

[l(z)+r(z)] + e

i

2

[l(z)r(z)]

[l(z)+r(z)](cid:27) .
from this expression we see that the (, )-representation of |i is

[l(z)r(z)] + e i
2

+e i
2

(b.4)

(b.5)

|i = i 1/2 1/2|n = 0, w = 0i 

+|n = 0, w = 2i + |n = 1, w = 0ii .
when we saturate |b(), +ins with this state, we get

1

2h|n = 1, w = 0i + |n = 0, w = 2i

h|b(), +ins = (1  cos()) n 

(b.6)

which agrees with eq. (b.3) if  = 1. notice that for  = 0, this overlap vanishes;
this is to be expected since |b( = 0), +ins is equivalent to the original boundary
state |b, +ins of eq. (3.3) with which |i has zero overlap.

26

let us now consider the following state

which corresponds to the vertex operator

|i = 1 1|n = 0, w = 0i

1
2 xl(z) xr(z) .
saturating |i against the boundary state |eb, +i we get

w(z, z) = 

h|eb, +i = n  .

after bosonization the vertex w becomes

w(z, z) = 

i
2

(z)(z)(cid:26)e

i

2

[l(z)+r(z)] + e

i

2

[l(z)r(z)]

+e i
2

[l(z)r(z)] + e i
2

[l(z)+r(z)](cid:27) ,

and the corresponding state is

|i = 

i
2

1/2 1/2h|n = 1, w = 0i + |n = 0, w = 2i

+|n = 0, w = 2i + |n = 1, w = 0ii .
computing its overlap with the boundary state |b(), +ins, we get

h|b(), +ins =  cos()n 

which again agrees with eq. (b.9) for  = 1.

our last example concerns the state

which is created by the following vertex operator

|i = i 1/2 1/2|n = 0, w = 0i

w(z, z) = i (z) (z) .

(b.7)

(b.8)

(b.9)

(b.10)

(b.11)

(b.12)

(b.13)

(b.14)

(b.15)

its overlap with the boundary state |eb, +i is

h|eb, +i = n 

using the bosonization rules of section 3, one easily sees that the vertex w written
in terms of  and  is

w(z, z) = 

1

2(cid:26)e
e i
2

i

2

i

[l(z)+r(z)]  e
[l(z)r(z)] + e i
2

2

[l(z)r(z)]

[l(z)+r(z)](cid:27) ,

(b.16)

27

so that the corresponding state is

|i = 

1

2h|n = 1, w = 0i  |n = 0, w = 2i
|n = 0, w = 2i + |n = 1, w = 0ii .

when we compute its overlap with the boundary state |b(), +ins we get

h|b(), +ins = cos()n 

(b.17)

(b.18)

which once more coincides with eq. (b.15) if  = 1.

all these examples provide convincing evidence that indeed the boundary state

|eb, +i dened in eq. (3.33) is equivalent to the boundary state |b(), +ins dened
in eq. (3.17) for  = 1. furthermore, as a byproduct of these calculations, we
can also verify that |b( = 0), +ins and the original boundary state |b, +ins of
eq. (3.3) are equivalent as they should.
