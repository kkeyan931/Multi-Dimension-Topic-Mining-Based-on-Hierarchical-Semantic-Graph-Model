1 introduction:

although classical general relativity (gr) is successful as a macroscopical
theory,there are some experimental data of physical phenomena which remain
unexplained. a good example is the eclipsing non degenerate binary stars.

as a matter of fact,a generalized theory of gravitation is needed. based
on einsteins idea moat built a new theory of gravity but with the an-
tisymmetric part of the metric taken to be as a part of the gravitation
itself. this theory was baptized nonsymmetric gravitation theory (n gt )
[1]-[7] where its predictions are consistent with all of gravitation classical
tests (solar system etc  ).
despite this fact,one needs to quantize the theory in order to here a con-
sistent physical interpretation al the level scale and the unication program
with the other three fundamental interactions will be successfully described.
in fact,in our work of ref.[8],we have constructed an ngt quantum la-
grangian and discovered a huge symmetry [9]-[14] which let be us hope that
this theory may be a good candidate for a renormalizeble gravitation theory.
moreover,and as in the case of ordinary supersymmetric gauge theories or
supergravity cancellation the supersymmetric version of quantum nonsym-
metric gravitation theory is needed for the divergences of unwanted if there
exist or a possibility to have a nite quantum theory describing gravity.

it is the purpose of this paper to construct an n = 1,d = 4 quantum
nonsymmetric supergravity and establish the corresponding brst transfor-
mations related to the general coordinates,local and supersymmetric trans-
formations.
in section 2,we give a brief survey of our classical model of
n = 1,d = 4 nonsymmetric supergravity [13].
in section 3 we quantize
our model `a la brst and construct the corresponding quantum lagrangian.
finally in section 4,we draw our conclusions.

2 classical nonsymmetric supergravity:

as it is discussed in our ref.[15] and in order to get a realistic model an
simplify matter in constructing a supersymmetric (susy) model of ngt

2

,the tangent space is taken to be the lorentz group manifold. it is important
to note that this choice does not contradict the well known general properties
and features of ngt,namely the compatibility condition:

with ea


 is the vierbein elds and w 

 through the projection relation:

ea

, + ()a

cec

e

a = 0

  w
 is related to the ane connection

(2.1)

where

w 

 = 

  2

3 

w

w = w 

[] = 1

2 (w 

  w 
)

and reality (in the sence of hyperbolic complex numbers) of the lagrangian:

g =  1

2 (eee)

1

2 e aee b (r)ab ()

(2.2)

e = det ea



where

and

(r)ab () = ()ab,  ()ab, + [, ]ab

(2.3)

(the symbol  means hyperbolic complex conjugate) an immediate conse-
quence of this choice is the reality of the spin connection:

()a

b = (e)a

b

(2.4)

it is worth to mention that the lagrangian (2.2)describes spin 2 and spin
0 particles related to the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the metric
and called graviton and skewon respectively[1]-[6]. in the context of n = 1
supersymmetry,one has to associate to each bosonic particle a fermionic part-
ner (and vice versa). this means that one has to have a susy doublet of a
graviton ( respectively skewon) and a fermionic spin 3
however,since the vierbein ea
 does not represent directly the graviton and
skewon,the strategy followed in our ref.[15] consists of rst constructing in

2 (cid:16)respectively 1

2(cid:17) elds.

3

the same manner as for the bosonic part of the lagrangian,the fermionic
part,then deriving various elds combinations representing the real particles
in the model.

the fermionic part of the lagrangian is given by [15]:

where

 = (1 )

 + e(1 )



(2.5)

(2.6)

(1 )
 =  i

2  e 5 d

and the massless fermionic eld  is hyperbolic complex and majorana

spinor. moreover the generalized levi-civita tensor e in the nonsym-

metric curved space-time has as expression:

(cid:16)icjk is the usual totally antisymmetric tensor(cid:17). it is worth to mention that

the covariant derivative d in (2.6) is dened as:

1

2 icjkei

ec

ej

k

(2.7)

e = (eee)

ee

with the lorentz group so (3, 1) generators ab given by:

d =  + 1

2 

abab

ab = 1

4 [a, b]

(2.8)

(2.9)

( s are the dirac matrices). notice that,the majorana condition as well as
the hyperbolic complex structure allow the fermionic eld  to have just
four degrees of freedom. now,if one takes as a supersymmetric lagrangian:

 = g + 

(2.10)

it turns out that in d = 4 dimensions the bosonic and fermionic degrees of
freedom mismatch. in fact,we have three bosonic and four fermionic degrees
of freedom,corresponding to the graviton,skewon and the hyperbolic complex
majorana fermionic eld .

to bypass this unwanted diculty,one has to introduce a dynamical scalar

eld  with one bosonic degree of freedom through the lagrangian:

 = (eee)

where

it is now straightforward to show that the total action:

g() = 1

3 brst transformations:

3.1 general coordinates transformations:

under innitesimal general coordinate transformations,any tensor eld 1 r
1s
transforms as:

1 r

1 si
1s =  (x)h1 r



(3.1.1)

where:

1si
h1 r



=

rpp =1

 1 p 1p +1 r
p

1 s

+

spq=1

q1 r


1 q+1s

(3.1.2)

to get the corresponding brst transformations,one has to replace the
transformation parameter x by c ,where  is an anticommuting factor
and:

c  =  + 

(3.1.3)

with  the ghost eld and  its hyperbolic complex conjugate. thus,the
metric tensor g transforms as:

brst
g

g =  [g c  + gc ]

(3.1.4)

regarding the commutation relation with the derivative operator,it is easy
to show that for any tensor eld 1 r

1 s one has:

hbrst

g

, i 1 r

1 s =  (c ) 1 r

1 s

(3.1.5)

7

this means (and as it is expected) that the brst
does not commute with
the derivative operator . to get the brst transformation of the ghost
eld,one has to use the nilpotency property applied on the metric tensor g.
thus,using eq.(3.1.4) we obtain:

g

brst
g

(cid:16) c (cid:17) = (cid:16)c (cid:17) (c )

(3.1.6)

as in the case of gauge theories,one generally introduces an auxiliary real

(in the sence of hyperbolic complex numbers) vector eld b such that:

brst
g

c  = b

(3.1.7)

it is obvious from the denition (3.1.7) that the nilpotency property of the
brst
g

implies:

regarding the gravitino ,one can deduce from the transformation (2.14)

brst
g

b = 0

(3.1.8)

that:

brst
g
brst
g

 = c ,  c 
 = c  ,   c 

,

,

(3.1.9)

just as in gauge theories,nsugra can not be quantied without gauge xing
,and in order to maintain manifest covariance,we should introduce a gauge
xing term into the fundamental lagrangian density. to be more explicit,let
us take the compatibility condition [1]-[3]:

g

, + g

 + g

 = 0

now,using the harmonic gauge [7]:

one can easily show that the gauge condition (3.1.11) gives:

g

 = 0

moreover

g() = g()

()

g g = 2

()

8

(3.1.10)

(3.1.11)

(3.1.12)

(3.1.13)

now,if one uses the identity:

 [(g)] =  1

2ggg

where g = det (g) together with eq.(3.1.13),one ends up with:

with:

bg() = 0
bg() = gg()

(3.1.14)

(3.1.15)

(3.1.16)

now,if one requires only poincare invariance,the choice of a gauge xing
term is quite arbitrary,because there exist two metrics g and  and also
an invariant quantity g. from the spirit of ngt,it is quite unnatural to
introduce  into fundamental lagrangian density. indeed,there is no reason
for assuming the priori existence of a particular cartesian coordinate system.
to forbid ,it is reasonable to require the gl (4, r) invariance,which is
relevant already at the classical level[8].

it is very important to note that a gauge xing term can be made a
gl (4, r) invariant way if and only if one employs the b eld formalism. if
b (x) is the gravitational auxiliary eld,which is a gl (4, r) covariant real
vector eld then the lagrangian:

gf  bg () (b + b)

(3.1.17)

can be taken as the gauge-xing lagrangian density which reproduces the
gauge condition (3.1.15) . from the experience in gauge theories,it might
be tempting to add a pure b-eld term to eq.(3.1.17). but it can not be
gl (4, r) invariant without using g. thus,under the gl (4, r),the choice
(3.1.17) is quite distinguished.

the fadeev-popov ghost lagrangian density fp is introduced in such a
and since

way that r d4x (gf + fp ) is brst invariant. on basis of brst
gd4x is an invariant volume then g (gf + fp ) should be a brst

g

invariant too. thus one can write:

gf + fp = gbrst

g

f

(3.1.18)

where f is a function. now,it is clear from eq.(3.1.7) and (3.1.17) that:

9

gf = g g ()hbrst

g

(cid:16)c  +  c (cid:17) + c c  + c c i

(3.1.19)

which can be written as:

gf = g[brst
= gbrst

g

g

g ()(cid:16)c  +  c (cid:17) + g ()c c]
[g()(cid:16)c  +  c(cid:17)]

(3.1.20)

comparing eqs (3.1.18) and (3.1.20) we obtain:

fp = g[(g c  + g c )(cid:16)c  + c (cid:17) + g ()(cid:16)c c  + c c (cid:17)]

(3.1.21)

3.2 local so (3, 1) transformations:

in the tangent space,the covariant derivative of the vierbein ea
[7],[15]:

 is given by

dea

 = ea

 + ()a

beb


(3.2.1)

where the spin connection ()ab satisfy the property (2.4). now,if we set:

dea

 = dxdea

 = dea

 + lea


with

dea

 = dxea


(3.2.2)

(3.2.3)

one deduces that the local so (3, 1) transformations of the vierbein ea

 are:

similarly,for the hyperbolic complex conjugate e one can write:

lea

 = a

beb


for the spinorial tensor ,it is easy to show that:

 = a

beb


leea

10

(3.2.4)

(3.2.5)

l = abab

(3.2.6)

where ab are the generators of the lorentz group.

now,regarding the local brst transformations and following the stan-

dard prescription [16],equations (3.2.4) , (3.2.5) became:

and

brst
l

brst
l

 = a
ea
eea

where we have used the property:

brst
l

 = abab

(here  is an anti-commuting number) .

b = a

b

ea

(3.2.7)

(3.2.8)

(3.2.9)

the nilpency property of brst

l

applied on the vierbein ea

 gives:

brst
l

a

b = a

cc

b

(3.2.10)

regarding the local quantum lagrangian,one has to notice that ea

 and g
have 32 and 16 independent components respectively. then,it is necessary to
introduce a gauge condition to eliminate 16 unphysical degrees of freedom.
one can choose as gauge:

 (eg ()a

b) = 0

(3.2.11)

or equivalently,one can add to the classical lagrangian the following gauge
xing term:

lgf = bg h()a

(3.2.12)

b s b

a  ()a

ai
bes b

bolic complex conjugate respectively.

where ,sab and esab are arbitrary scalar number,auxiliary eld and its hyper-
that r d4x (lgf + lfp ) is a locally brst invariant.

for the local fadeev-popov term lfp ,it can be introduced in such a way

now,if that 

b anti-ghost eld transforms as:

a

11

straightforward calculations lead to:

a

(3.2.14)

where the notion h.c.c. means hyperbolic complex conjugate and:

brst

b = ab + ()a

ccb  ()b

cac

(3.2.15)

3.3 the u (1) transformations:

it is important to notice that the lagrangian density (2.2) is invariant under
the abelian transformation:

w = 

(3.3.1)

where  is an arbitrary scalar eld. thus in nsugra,the group symmetry
gl (4, r) associated with the general coordinate transformations is extended
to include the abelian transformations (3.3.1). one can choose a gauge con-
dition:

or equivalently,one can add to the lagrangian a gauge xing term agf :

w = 0

(3.3.2)

agf =  (w)2

(3.3.3)

( is a constant) .

3.4 local sypersymmetric transformations:

following the standard method,then from the local susy transformations
(2.17) , (2.18) , (2.21) and (2.22) one can deduce the following corresponding
brst transformations:

12

 = ici
 = z k

 c

brst
su sy ei
brst

su sy eek
ebrst

su sy  = he  ei d c + f c

su sy g = v 
brst
brst
su sy  = jv 

()c
c

where  is an anticommuting factor and c given by:

c = a + ea

(3.4.1)

(3.4.2)

with a the ghost eld and ea its hyperbolic complex conjugate.

now,suppose that we lave a classical action i depending on a set of gauge
elds i and which is invariant under local gauge transformations with para-
mater :

i = ri

 () 

(3.4.3)

the symbol r may cntain derivatives and depends on gauge elds. the
paramater  depends on x and represents the parameter general coordi-
nate,local lorentz and local supersymmetry. as in ordinary gauge theo-
ries,one adds a gauge xing term if ix for each local gauge invariance and
taken to be quadratic in the gauge choice f ():

if ix = 1

2 f () f ()

(3.4.4)

note that the above choice of action is not necessary,but useful in order to
be able to dene propagators. in fact the kinetic terms of the sum i + if ix
are non singular,so that one can invert them to obtain the propagators of the
theory. the matrix  is taken to be independent of the quantum gauge
elds i.

by varying the gauge choices one obtain i (ghost):

i (ghost) = c



f,jr

jc 

(3.4.5)

thus,the total quantum lagrangian is given by:

it ot = i + if ix + i (ghost)

(3.4.6)

13

the quantum equivalent of the classical gauge invariance given by eq.(3.4.3) is
the brst transformations. this quantum symmetry has as a transformation
parameter an anticommuting number  and reads:

brst
su sy i = ri
su sy c  =  1
brst
brst
su sy c

 () c 
2 f 
 = f

c c 

(3.4.7)

not that the invariance of (3.4.6) under (3.4.7) is easy to demonstrate (see appendix).

now,in our case,and in order to eliminate the extra degrees of freedom of

the gravitino-skewino spinor ,one has to take the following xing term:

with

and

lf

su sy = (cid:18) p (cid:19) 6 (cid:16)ep (cid:17)

p = 

6  = 

moreover,from eqs.(3.4.7) and (3.4.8) and using the fact that:

(3.4.9)

(3.4.10)

(3.4.11)

and after straightforward calculations,one can deduce the following faddeev-
popov term:

su sy =

(3.4.15)

through this work,we have constructed an ngt supersymmetric quantum
lagrangian (qnsugra) as well as the corresponding brst transformations
related to the various existing symmetries. regarding this huge beautiful
symmetries,one may hope to have at hand a nite theory of gravity or at
least a renormalized one[9]-[14].

appendix a:

the variation of if ix and of c



yield:

f(cid:16)f,jrj

c (cid:17) +(cid:16)f(cid:17) f,jrj

c 

(a-1)

which vanishes since the variation of an action is a bosonic object. the
remaining terms cause from varying f,jrj
c . the variation of f,j in
(3.4.6) vanishes since:

f,jk = (1)jk f,kj

rk

c rj

c  = (1)(k+1)(j+1)+k+1+j+1 (k  j)

(a-2)

(a-3)

so that the symmetries of both term in (j, k) are opposite. for the variation
of rj

c  one nds:

rj

,krk

c c   1

2 f 

rj

c c  = 0

(a-4)

closure of the gauge algebra implies that the commutation of the local gauge
transformation is a gain a local gauge transformation,this again of the form
(a-1):

[ () ,  ()] = ri

,krk

     
f 

 

= rj

(a-5)

the structure constants f 
 may depend on . these equations are be
local equivalent of the (anti) commutation which dene superalgebra. it is
now,clear why (a-4) vanishes.

replacing in eq. (a-5)  by c  and  by c 1 one nds the combi-

nation:

(cid:16)c (cid:17) (c 1) (cid:16)c 1(cid:17) (c ) = 2(cid:16)c c (cid:17) 1

(a-6)

thus,the rst term in eq.(a-4) can be written as a commutation,and apply-
ing eq.(a-5) ,one completes the proof that eq.(3.4.6) is invariant under the
transformations (a-5).
