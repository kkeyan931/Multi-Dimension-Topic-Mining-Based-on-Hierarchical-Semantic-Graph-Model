1. introduction

the study of many body physics as well as the study of elementary parti-
cle physics has convinced us that at a very basic level nature is ruled by
quantum dynamical laws. on the other hand, we also know and observe sev-
eral systems, such as superconductors, superuids, crystals, ferromagnets,
which behave as macroscopic quantum systems.

the question then arises of how the quantum dynamics may generate
the observed macroscopic properties. in other words, how it happens that
the macroscopic scale characterizing those systems is dynamically generated
out of the microscopic scale of the quantum elementary components[1].

moreover, we also observe a varieties of phenomena where quantum ob-
jects coexist and interact with extended macroscopic objects which show
classical behavior, e.g. vortices in superconductors and superuids, mag-
netic domains in ferromagnets, dislocations and other defects in crystals.

thus, we are faced also with the question of the quantum origin of the
macroscopically behaving extended objects and of their interaction with
quanta[2]. even for structures at cosmological scale, the question of their
dynamical origin from elementary components asks for an answer consistent
with quantum dynamical laws[3].

macroscopic quantum systems are quantum systems not, of course, in
the rather trivial sense that they are made by quantum components, but in
the sense that, although they behave classically, nevertheless some of their
macroscopic features cannot be understood without recurse to quantum

theory. quantum theory thus appears not conned to microscopic phenom-
ena.

in this respect it is remarkable that these classical systems present ob-
servable ordered patterns, e.g. crystal ordering, phase coherence, ferromag-
netic ordering, etc.. moreover, most extended objects present some topo-
logical singularity, and interesting enough, these topologically non-trivial
defects only appear in systems presenting an ordered state.

the formation of defects in the course of phase transitions provides a
further source of questions which are attracting much attention since it
appears that defect formation during phase transitions may reveal unifying
understanding of phenomena belonging to a wide range of energy scale[4].
the task of this paper is to review some of the main aspects in the
quantum field theory (qft) description of topological defect formation,
which also illustrate how to get the macroscopic scale out of the quantum
dynamics. i will further mention some recent developments dealing with
temperature eects on defect formation[5].

the paper is organized as follows. i will consider the problem of dynam-
ical generation of order in quantum systems in section 2. the key ingredi-
ents are the mechanism of spontaneous breakdown of symmetry (sbs) and
the consequent appearance of nambu-golsdtone (ng) boson particles[6, 7]
(such as phonons in crystals). in order to present a general, model indepen-
dent discussion, i will use functional integration techniques. as we will see,
ng modes manifest as long range correlations and thus they are responsible
of the above mentioned change of scale, from microscopic to macroscopic.
the coherent boson condensation of ng modes turns out to be the mecha-
nism by which order is generated. from the point of view of the invariance
properties of the theory, the mathematical structure of the contraction[8]
of the symmetry group is the one controlling the sbs mechanism[9].

i will show how topologically non-trivial defects are generated in quan-
tum systems by non-homogeneous boson condensation in section 3. here
the so called boson transformation reveals to be the crucial tool. i will prove
that topological defects only can be formed in the presence of ng modes,
i.e. in the presence of ordering. this sheds some light on the mechanism by
which defect formation occurs in phase transitions, i.e. in the presence of
gradients of the order parameter. interaction of defects with quanta is also
very briey considered in this section. explicit vortex solutions in terms of
boson condensation are presented in section 4.

and on symmetry restoration are considered in section 5. contact with the
problem of defect formation in phase transition processes is also made in
this section.

a preliminary remark to my subsequent discussion is the following.
the von neumann theorem in quantum mechanics (qm) [10] states
that for systems with a nite number of degrees of freedom all the repre-
sentations of the canonical commutation relations are unitarily equivalent.
this theorem actually states that in qm the physical system can only live
in one single phase: unitary equivalence means indeed physical equivalence
and thus there is no room ( no representations) to represent dierent phys-
ical phases. fortunately, such a situation drastically changes in qft where
systems with innitely many degrees of freedom are studied. in such a
case the von neumann theorem does not hold and innitely many unitarily
inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations do in
fact exist[11]. it is such a richness of qft which allows the description
of dierent physical phases. the occurrence of spontaneous breakdown of
symmetry and of the related ng boson condensation becomes thus possible
in qft.

although one can set up many formal devices based on more or less
sophisticate approximations, or even on semi-classical methods, which may
nevertheless lead to phenomenologically successful results, it should be al-
ways understood that the proper theoretical framework where to operate
dealing with phase transitions, defect formation and all that is the larger
manifold of unitarily inequivalent representations provided by qft.

2. spontaneous breakdown of symmetry and group contraction

in qft the dynamics is described by a set of eld equations for the inter-
acting operator elds, say (x), also called the heisenberg elds. these are
the basic elds of the theory satisfying equal-time canonical commutation
relations and the heisenberg eld equations

() (x) = j[](x) ,

(1)

where x  (t, x). j is a functional of the  eld describing the interaction.
observable phenomena are on the other hand described by observable
(physical) operator elds (such as phonons), say (x). they also obey
equal-time canonical commutation relations and satisfy free eld equations,
which, with convenient care in the renormalization procedure, may be writ-

4

ten as

() (x) = 0 .

(2)

the hilbert space, say h, for the physical states is the fock space for the
elds . solving the dynamical problem thus means to compute by means
of eq. (1) the matrix elements of  in the space h: this will relate the
basic dynamics to the observable properties of the physical states. in this
way we obtain the dynamical map between interacting elds and physical
elds[1, 2]:

(x) = f [x; ] .

(3)

eq.(3) is also called the haag expansion in the lsz formalism[12]. i have to
stress that the equality in (3) is a weak equality: it must be understood
as an equality among matrix elements computed in h.

this a crucial point and a couple of remarks need to be made. first,
i observe that the set of  elds must be an irreducible set; however, it
may happen that not all the elements of the set are known since the begin-
ning. for example there might be composite (bound states) elds or even
elementary quanta whose existence is ignored in a rst recognition. then
the computation of the matrix elements in physical states will lead to the
detection of unexpected poles in the greens functions, which signal the ex-
istence of the ignored quanta. one thus introduces the elds corresponding
to these quanta and repeats the computation. this way of proceeding is
called the self-consistent method[2]. in this connection, i note that it is not
necessary to have a one-to-one correspondence between the sets {i} and
{i}. this happens in fact when the set {i} includes composite particles.
another remark is that, as already mentioned, in qft the fock space
for the physical states is not unique: one may have indeed several physical
phases, e.g. for a metal the normal phase and the superconducting phase,
and so on. fock spaces describing dierent phases are unitarily inequivalent
spaces and correspondingly we have dierent expectation values for certain
observables and even dierent irreducible sets of physical quanta; for exam-
ple, in ferromagnets this set includes magnon elds which do not exist in
the non-magnetic phase, etc.. thus, nding the dynamical map involves the
choice of the fock space where the dynamics has to be realized: in other
words the same dynamics (i.e. same heisenberg elds and same heisenberg
eld equations) may generate dierent physical phases.

defect formation through boson condensation

suppose now that the dynamics is invariant under some group g of

transformations of :

(x)  (x) = g [(x)] ,

(4)

with g  g. invariance of the dynamics means that the heisenberg equa-
tions (or the lagrangian from which they may be derived) are invariant (in
form) under the transformations of g.

one says that symmetry is spontaneously broken when the vacuum state
in the fock space h is not invariant under the group g but only under one
of its subgroups[1, 2, 12].

eq. (3) implies that when  is transformed as in (4), then

(x)  (x) = g [(x)] ,

such that

with g belonging to some group of transformations g.

g [(x)] = f (cid:2)g [(x)](cid:3) ,

(5)

(6)

now it happens, as we will see below, that g 6= g when symmetry is
spontaneously broken, with g the group contraction of g[9]; when sym-
metry is not broken g = g.

since g is the invariance group of the dynamics, eq. (3) requires that
g is the group under which free elds equations are invariant, i.e.  also is
a solution of (2). since eq. (3) is a weak equality, g depends on the choice
of the fock space h (among the physically realizable unitarily inequiva-
lent state spaces). thus we see that the original (same) invariance of the
dynamics may manifest itself in dierent symmetry groups for the  elds
according to dierent choices of the physical state space. since this process
is constrained by the dynamical equations (1), it is called the dynamical
rearrangement of symmetry[1, 2, 13].

to be specic, let me consider, in the path-integral formalism, a complex
scalar eld (x) interacting with a gauge eld a(x) (anderson-higgs-
kibble type model)[14, 15, 16]. the lagrangian density l[(x), (x), a(x)]
is invariant under the global and the local gauge transformations:

(x)  ei(x)

,

a(x)  a(x) ,

(7)

(x)  eie0(x)(x)

,

(8)
respectively, where (x)  0 for |x0|   and/or |x|  . the lorentz
gauge ah (x) = 0 is used. i put (x) = 12

a(x)  a(x) + (x) ,

[(x) + i(x)].

6

giuseppe vitiello

spontaneous breakdown of symmetry is introduced through the condi-
tion h0|h (x)|0i  v 6= 0, with v constant and i put (x)  (x)  v.
here h(x) denotes the heisenberg eld. (x) is the c-number eld enter-
ing the functional integral. the generating functional, including the gauge
constraint, is[17]

w [j, k] =

1

n z [da][d][d][db] exp(cid:20)iz d4x (l(x) + b(x)a(x)+
k + k + j (x)a(x) + i|(x)  v|2(cid:17)i ,

(9)

with n a convenient normalization. b(x) is an auxiliary eld which guar-
antees the gauge condition. the role of the term is to specify the con-
dition of symmetry breakdown under which we want to compute the path-
integral[18, 19]. it may be given the physical meaning of the small external
eld triggering the symmetry breakdown. the limit   0 must be made
at the end of the computations.

as customary, i will use the notation hf []ik, to denote functional
average and hf []i  hf []i,k=0 , hf []i  lim0 hf []i. note that
h(x)i = 0 because of the invariance under   .

invariance of the path-integral under the change of variables (7) (and/or

(8) ) leads to

h(x)i = 2 vz d4yh(x)(y)i = 2 v (, 0) .

(10)

this is one of the ward-takahashi identities. such identities carry the sym-
metry content of the theory. in momentum space the propagator for the
heisenberg eld  has the general form

(0, p) = lim

0"

z
p2  m2

+ (continuum contributions)# .

(11)

z and a are renormalization constants. the integration in eq.(10) picks
up the pole contribution at p2 = 0, and leads to

v = 2

z

v  m = 0 ,

or

v = 0  m 6= 0 .

(12)

the goldstone theorem[6] is thus proved[18, 19]: if the symmetry is spon-
taneously broken (v 6= 0), a massless mode exists, whose interpolating
heisenberg eld is (x). it is the ng boson mode. since it is massless
it manifests as a long range correlation mode. notice that the ng mode

is an elementary eld. in other models it may appear as a bound state,
e.g. the magnon in ferromagnets[20]. note that[18, 19] v is independent of
|v|, although the phase of |v| determines the one of v: as in ferromagnets,
once an external magnetic eld is switched on, the system is magnetized
independently of the strength of the external eld.

the analysis of the two-point functions of the theory shows[17] that
the model contains a massless negative norm state (ghost), besides the ng
massless mode , and a massive vector eld u . the dynamical maps are:

the eld equations for bh and ah are

(18)

2bh(x) = 0 ,  2ah(x) = jh(x)  bh(x) ,

(19)

with jh(x) = l(x)/a
h (x). one may then require that the current jh
is the only source of the gauge eld ah in any observable process. this
amounts to impose the condition: phb|bh(x)|aip = 0, i.e.
h(x)|aip = phb|jh(x)|aip ,

(2) phb|a0

(20)

8

where |aip and |bip denotes two generic physical states. eq.(20) are the
classical maxwell equations. the condition phb|bh(x)|aip = 0 leads to
the gupta-bleuler-like condition

where ()
in are the positive-frequency parts of the corresponding
elds. thus we see that in and bin do not participate to any observable
reaction. note in fact that they are present in the s matrix in the combi-
nation (in bin). it is to be remarked that the ng boson do not disappear
from the theory: we will see that in situations in which the vacuum is not
translationally invariant, the ng elds can have observable eects.

the study of the dynamical rearrangement of the symmetry shows that

local gauge transformations of the heisenberg elds

(26)

note that under the above in-eld transformations the in-eld equations
and the s matrix are invariant and that bh is changed by an irrelevant
c-number. we thus see that the original invariance cannot be lost even at
the level of the physical elds, although it can manifest there in a dierent
symmetry group structure.

eq. (25) shows that the physical eld in translates by a constant when
the heisenberg eld  undergoes the global phase transformation (and vice
versa): the global u (1) invariance group is dynamically rearranged into
the one-parameter constant translation group. this last one is the group
contraction of global u (1).

defect formation through boson condensation

9

notice that translation by a constant is an invariant transformation for
the in eld equation if and only if in is a massless eld. thus the rear-
rangement into the contraction of global u (1) group has the same content
as the goldstone theorem[9]. it is also interesting to note that while u (1) is
a compact group its contraction is not compact. since the number operator
of in eld changes under the translation (25) we say that we have in
coherent boson condensation.

it must be stressed that the translation by a constant (25) must be

actually understood as the limit for f (x)  1 of the transformation

in(x, ) = in(x) +

f (x) ,

v

(27)

with f (x) a normalizable solution of the in eld equation: 2f (x) = 0.
eq. (25) induces infrared singularities in feynman diagrams with many
momentumless and energyless lines. these are smeared out by use of (27).
however, notice that matrix elements are well dened even when (25) is
used. also, the function f (x) appearing in the generator of (27) makes it
well dened[19, 20, 21].

since dierent physical phases (unitarily inequivalent representations)
are associated to dierent ng boson condensation densities, we see that
boson translations, by inducing variation of ng boson condensation, rep-
resent transitions through physically dierent phases. in particular, i will
discuss non-homogeneous boson condensation induced by transformations
such as (27).

the dynamical rearrangement of symmetry has been studied in many
models of physical interest. in the case of global su (2) invariance group,
for example in ferromagnets[20], or in systems with isospin vector elds[21],
the ng boson condensation is controlled by the e(2) group, which is the
group contraction of su (2)[9]. unfortunately, for lack of space i cannot
report about these and some other interesting cases.

3. observable eects of non-homogeneous boson transformations

translations of bosonic physical elds (not necessarily massless) by space-
time dependent functions, say (x), satisfying the same eld equation of
the translated physical eld, are called boson transformations[1, 2, 19]. eq.
(27) is thus an example of boson transformation.

let h denote the heisenberg eld obtained through the dynamical
mapping when the physical eld undergoes the boson transformation. the

10

giuseppe vitiello

boson transformation theorem can be then proved, which states that h is
also a solution of the heisenberg eld equation[1, 2, 19].

the proof of the theorem consists in showing that the boson-transformed
elds, say h[x; in(x)+(x)], dier from h[in(x)] only by an dependent
factor and therefore are solutions of the same eld equations.

in the absence of a gauge eld, under boson transformation the order

parameter gets space-time dependence given by

v(x) = exp


(x)

 ,

(28)

where the expansion of v(x) around (x) = 0 is used (v (i(x))  0
when (x)  0). note that the modulus of v changes and in the limit
  const. only its phase is changed.

in the case a gauge eld is present, it can be shown that any space-time
dependence of the term can be eliminated by a gauge transformation
when (x) is a regular (i.e. fourier transformable) function and the only
eect is the appearance of a phase factor in the order parameter: v(x) =
eic(x)v, with c a constant.

the conclusion is that when a gauge eld is present, the boson trans-
formation with regular (x) is equivalent to a gauge transformation. on
the contrary, in a theory with global invariance only, non-singular boson
transformations of the ng elds can produce non-trivial physical eects
(like linear ow in superuidity).

i want to stress that, in the case of global phase transformations as
well as in the case of local gauge transformations, the proof of the boson
transformation theorem relies on the fact that (x) is a regular function.
if one wants to consider functions with some singularities (divergence and
topological singularities) one has to carefully exclude the singularity regions
when integrating on space and/or time. for example, if (x) is singular on
the axis of a cylinder (at r = 0) one must exclude the singular line r = 0 by a
cylindrical surface of innitesimal radius. the phase of the order parameter
will be singular on that line. this means that sbs does not occur in that
region (the core): there we have the normal state rather than the ordered
one. provided one uses such care, the boson transformation can be safely
(and advantageously) used also in the case of singular (x).

the boson theorem has relevant physical meaning since it shows that
the same dynamics may describe homogeneous and non-homogeneous phe-
nomena. when a theory allows sbs, there always exist solutions of the eld

defect formation through boson condensation

11

equations with space and/or time-dependent vacuum. these solutions are
obtained from the translationally invariant ones by the boson transforma-
tion of the ng eld: they results from a local bose condensation of the in
particles. this directly leads us to the mechanism of formation of extended
objects (defect formation).

notice that in local gauge theories the boson transformation must be
compatible with heisenberg eld equations but also with the physical state
condition (21). under the boson transformation with (x) = v
f (x) and
z

2f (x) = 0, bh changes as

bh(x)  bh(x) 

e0v2
z

f (x) ,

(29)

eq. (20) is thus violated when the gupta-bleuler-like condition is imposed.
in order to restore it, the shift in bh must be compensated by means of
the transformation on uin:

u 
in(x)  u 

in(x) + z3 1

2 a(x)

,

a(x) = 0 ,

(30)

with a convenient c-number function a(x). the dynamical maps of the
various heisenberg operators are not aected by (30) since they contain
in and bh(x) in a combination such that the changes of bh and of u 
u 
compensate each other provided

(31)

eq. (31) thus obtained is the maxwell equation for the massive potential
vector a[17, 22]. the classical ground state current j turns out to be

the macroscopic eld and current are thus given in terms of the boson

condensation function.

the (classical) boson current is given by f , i.e. by variations in the
non-homogeneous boson condensate: boson condensation functions must
play a role in phase transitions where boson condensate indeed changes.

12

giuseppe vitiello

let me now show that boson transformation functions carrying topolog-

ical singularities are only allowed for massless bosons[2, 23, 24].

suppose the function f (x) for the boson transformation of the eld in

carries a topological singularity and is thus path-dependent:

g (x)  [,  ] f (x) 6= 0 ,

f or certain  ,  , x .

(33)

on the other hand,  f , which is related with observables, is single-valued,
i.e. [,  ] f (x) = 0. recall that f (x) is solution of the in equation and
suppose there is a non-zero mass term:

(2 + m2)f (x) = 0 .

(34)

from the denition of g and the regularity of f (x) it follows that

f (x) =

1

2 + m2  g(x) ,

(35)

which leads to 2f (x) = 0 which implies m = 0.

thus (33) is only compatible with massless equation for in.
the quantity  f (x) is given by (35) with m = 0. from this equation,

f (x) can be determined. the topological charge is dened as

nt = zc

dl  f = zs

ds  f =

1

2 zs

ds g .

(36)

here c is a contour enclosing the singularity and s a surface with c as
boundary. nt does not depend on the path c provided this does not cross
the singularity. the dual tensor g is

g (x)  
and satises the continuity equation

1
2

g(x)

(37)

 g (x) = 0



 g +  g +  g = 0 .

(38)

this equation completely characterizes the topological singularity [2, 24].
let me now observe that all the macroscopic ground state eects do
not occur for regular f (x) (g = 0). in fact, from (31) we obtain a(x) =
1
f (x) for regular f which implies zero classical current (j = 0) and
e0
zero classical eld (f = a  a), since the meissner and the boson
current cancel each other.

defect formation through boson condensation

13

in conclusion, the vacuum current appears only when f (x) has topolog-
ical singularities and these can be created only by condensation of massless
bosons, e.g. by condensation of ng bosons when sbs occurs. this ex-
plains why topological defects appear in the process of phase transitions,
where ng modes are present and gradients in their condensate densities
are nonzero.

on the other hand, the appearance of space-time order parameter is no
guarantee that persistent ground state currents (and elds) will exist: if f
is a regular function, the space-time dependence of v can be gauged away
by an appropriate gauge transformation.

since the boson transformation with regular f does not aect observable

quantities, the s matrix (13) is actually given by

s = : s[in, u

(in  bin)] :

.

(39)

this is in fact independent of the boson transformation with regular f :

thus we see how quantum uctuations may interact and have eects on
classically behaving macroscopic defects: our picture includes interaction of
quanta with macroscopic objects. much more can be said on the interaction
of extended objects with quanta; however, for shortness i will not discuss
more on that.

the line singularity for the vortex solution can be parameterized by a
single line parameter  and by the time parameter  . the static vortex
solution is then obtained by setting y0(, ) =  and y(, ) = y(), with
y denoting the line coordinate. g is non-zero only on the line at y (we
can consider more lines but here i limit myself to one line, for simplicity).

the only non-zero components of these elds are a1, a2, f12, j1 and j2.

notice that the condition (38) can be shown to be violated if the line
singularity has isolated end points inside the system. thus consistency with
the continuity equation (38) implies that either the string is innite, or that
it form a closed loop. also, if there are more than one string, the end points
of dierent strings can be connected in a vertex, eq.(38) resulting then in
a condition for the relative string tensions , with  denoting dierent
strings.

further simple examples are the following[2, 22, 24].

a straight line along the third axis moving in the x1 direction with
velocity v is given by y(,  ) = (v, 0, ), y0(,  ) =  , from which g03(x) =
 (x1  vt) (x2) and g13(x) = v (x1  vt) (x2).

consider the u (1) invariant model at nite temperature. the breakdown
of symmetry condition in the homogeneous condensation case is[26]

h0()|(x)|0()i =

(55)

where   1
kb t . |0()i denotes the temperature dependent vacuum state
in thermo field dynamics [2]. note that the statistical average of any
operator a is given by < a >0= h0()|a|0()i.

i omit to consider here the presence of other elds (such as the ghost
elds) for brevity. the elds ,  and a may undergo translation transfor-
mations by c-number functions, say ,  and , respectively, controlling
the respective condensate structures. i write    + 12

transformations are induced by using  = 0,  = (x) and (x) = (x).

where m and  denote the higgs eld mass and self-coupling, respectively,
v  h0||0i at t = 0 and is assumed to be non-zero, m is the gauge eld
mass and e is the (electric charge) coupling between a and .  and a
denote the physical elds.

eqs.(56) are actually self-consistent equations since <: 2 :>0 also de-
pends on m2. in the discontinuous phase transition case the free energy
should be examined[26]. the proper phase transition point is dened by
the equality between the ordered and the disordered free energy phase.

as t  0 eqs. (56) show that 0  v thus recovering the original zero
temperature symmetry breaking. we have phase transition to the (disor-
dered) phase 0(c ) = 0 at the critical temperature tc such that

v2 = 3 <: 2 :>0 

e2


<: a a :>0

.

above the phase transition point t > tc , and 0 = 0, we have[26]

m2 = v2 + 3 <: 2 :>0 e2 <: a a :>0

.

(58)

(59)

full symmetry restoration (i.e. v = 0) occurs at t  tsym such that thermal
contributions in (58) compensate each other, and then also m = 0. the
gauge eld mass m goes to zero not at tc, but at t such that

v2  2 <: 2 :>0 +e2 <: a a :>0= 0 .

(60)

the vortex solution arises in the non-homogeneous condensation case
obtained by introducing space dependence in the condensate functions. in-
troducing the cylindrical coordinates, the asymptotic gauge eld congu-
ration is imposed by considering the angle function as gauge function at

as t  0 these equations reduce to the usual vortex equations. one can

(65)

these masses act as potential terms in the eld equations and only at spatial
innity (r  , f (x)  1) ordinary mass interpretation is recovered. we
have in fact the asymptotic behavior

the t hooft-polyakov monopole and the sphaleron solutions at nite

temperature are discussed in [26].

let me now discuss the eects of the nite size of the system on the bo-
son condensate and the relation between nite size and temperature eects.
this will help to understand how temperature variations near tc control
the defect size (and thus the defect number)[5].

in the case of large but nite volume we expect that the condition of
symmetry breakdown is still satised inside the bulk far from the bound-
aries. however, near the boundaries, one might expect distortions in

18

giuseppe vitiello

the order parameter: v = v(x) (or even v  0). near the system bound-
aries we may have non-homogeneous order parameter. non-homogeneities
in the boson condensation will smooth out in the v   limit. suppose
the integration in eq. (10) is over the nite (but large) volume v  3
and use

which, as well known, approaches (p) as   0: lim0(p) = (p). now
(68)

lim0z dp (p) f (p) = f (0) = lim0z dp (p  ) f (p) ,

then, using (p)  (p  ) for small , it is

v(x, , ) = ieix (, , p0 = 0) ,

with 2
. thus, lim0lim0v(x, , ) 6= 0 only if m = 0,
otherwise v = 0. eq. (12) (the goldstone theorem) is thus recovered in the
innite volume limit (  0).

on the other hand, assume that ng modes are there, i.e. m = 0, then
  p= 6= 0 for  6= 0 and it acts as an eective mass for the ng
boson. here i mean that the ng boson is massless, but its lowest (zero)
energy is prevented to be reached, the lowest energy being given by the
non-zero . the eect of the boundaries ( 6= 0) is to give an eective
mass (in the above sense) mef f   to the ng bosons. these will then
propagate over a range of the order of   1
 , which is the system linear
size.

notice that only if  6= 0 the order parameter can be kept dierent
from zero, i.e. if  6= 0 then  must be non-zero in order to have v 6= 0
(at least locally). in such a case the symmetry breakdown is maintained
thanks to the non-zero coupling,  6= 0, with an external eld acting as
an external pump providing energy: energy supply is required in order to
condensate modes of non-zero lowest energy . boundary eects are thus
in competition with breakdown of symmetry[5, 28]. they may preclude its
occurrence or, if symmetry is already broken, they may reduce to zero the
order parameter.

we have seen that temperature may have similar eects on the order
parameter (at tc symmetry may be restored, cf. eq. (58) and the discussion

in terms of nite volume eects and put, e.g.,   q|ttc|

following it). since the order parameter goes to zero when ng modes ac-
quire non-zero eective mass, we may represent the eect of thermalization
. in this way
temperature uctuations around tc may be discussed as uctuations in
the condensate domain size . for example, in the presence of an external
driving eld ( 6= 0), for t > tc but near to tc one may have the forma-
tion of ordered domains of size   (q ttc
)1 before phase transition to
fully ordered phase is achieved (as t  tc). as far as  6= 0, the ordered
domains are unstable, they disappear as the external eld coupling   0.
of course, if ordered domains are still presents at t < tc, they also
disappear as   0. the possibility to maintain such ordered domains below
tc depends on the speed by which t is lowered, compared to the speed
by which the system is able to get homogeneously ordered. notice that the
speed by which t  tc is related to the speed by which   0.
in the case of the kink solution it can be shown[29] that the mass 0 =
2 v() of the constituent elds in xes the kink size   2

2v()
(2)
which thus increases as t  tc . it is also interesting to note that in the
t  0 limit the kink size is 0 

= , since v2() < v2.

as t is dierent from zero, the thermal bose condensate h: 2 :i0 devel-
ops which acts as a potential term for the quantum eld (x). such tem-
perature eects manifest at classical level as potential term for the classical
kink eld. it is such a potential term which actually controls the size
(and the number) of the kinks. notice that 2
0(x, ) also acts as a potential
for the in
 (x) eld may
be considered as a free eld; e.g. far from the kink core.

the in

 (x) condensation, whose macroscopic envelope is represented by
the soliton solution, is induced by the boson transformation with f(x) =
const. e0()x1 playing the role of form factor. the number of condensed
bosons is thus proportional to |f(x)|2 = e20() (x1a), which is maximal
near the kink center x1 = a and decrease over a size  = 2
0() . the
meaning of the boson transformation is that the f-translation breaks the
homogeneity of the otherwise constant in space order parameter v().

in conclusion, phase transitions imply moving over unitarily inequiva-
lent representations, and this in general implies non-trivial homotopy map-
ping between the (x, ) variability domain and the group manifold. the
order parameters v(x, ) and (x, ) introduced above provide a mapping
between the variation domains of (x, ) and the space of the unitarily in-
equivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations, i.e. the

20

giuseppe vitiello

set of hilbert spaces where the operator eld  is realized for dierent values
of the order parameter. the invariance under the theory symmetry group
then necessarily leads to ng boson condensation functions with topologi-
cal singularities. in other words, since phase transitions imply observable
changes in the system physical properties, boson condensation functions rel-
evant to phase transitions necessarily carry topological singularities (non-
singular functions have no observable eects, indeed). this explains why
we observe defect formation in the process of phase transition.

in the case of the kink there are no ng modes, nevertheless the topo-
logically non-trivial kink solution requires the boson condensation function
to carry divergence singularity (at spatial innity).

this work has been partially supported by infm, murst and the esf

network on topological defect formation in phase transitions.
