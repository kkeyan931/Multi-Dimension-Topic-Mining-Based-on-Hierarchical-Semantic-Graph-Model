abstract

the relation between the gauge-invariant local brst cohomology involving the
antields and the gauge-xed brst cohomology is claried. it is shown in particular
that the cocycle conditions become equivalent once it is imposed, on the gauge-xed
side, that the brst cocycles should yield deformations that preserve the nilpotency
of the (gauge-xed) brst dierential. this shows that the restrictions imposed
on local counterterms by the quantum noether condition in the epsteinglaser
construction of gauge theories are equivalent to the restrictions imposed by brst
invariance on local counterterms in the standard lagrangian approach.

1 introduction

in the brst approach to perturbative gauge theories [1, 2], the possible counterterms
are restricted by wardslavnovtaylor identities [3, 4, 5], which have a cohomological
interpretation. if one follows the path-integral approach and takes into account the renor-
malization of the brst symmetry `a la zinn-justin [6] by introducing sources coupled to
the brst variation of the elds and the ghosts, it may be shown [6, 1, 7, 8, 9] that the
counterterms must full the brst invariance condition

sa = 0,

(1.1)

where s is the brst dierential acting in the space of elds, ghosts and associated sources
(antields [10]). the counterterms are local, so a in (1.1) is given by the integral of a
local n-form a, in terms of which the brst invariance condition becomes

sa + db = 0,

(1.2)

for some (n  1)-form b. following an initial investigation by joglekar and lee [11], the
general solution of (1.2) for yangmills gauge models has been determined in [12], where
it was shown that up to trivial terms of the form sc + de, the counterterm a in (1.2) is
equal to a strictly gauge-invariant operator, plus chernsimons terms in odd space-time
dimensions (in the absence of u(1) factors for which there are further solutions [13], also
dealt with in [12]). this guarantees renormalizability of the theory in the modern sense
[14] in any number of spacetime dimensions, and in the standard power-counting sense in
4 dimensions.

if one follows instead the operator formalism and the quantum noether method based
on the gauge-xed brst formulation [15, 16], one nds that the counterterms are con-
strained by the condition

ga + db  0,

(1.3)

where g is the gauge-xed brst dierential acting on the elds and where both a and
b involve only the elds (no antield). the symbol  means equal when the (gauge-xed)
equations of motion hold.

the question then arises as to whether (1.2) and (1.3) are equivalent.

it may be
shown that the antield and gauge-xed local cohomologies are equivalent [17], so that
any solution a of sa = 0 denes a solution a of ga  0 and vice versa. this is not true,
however, for the cohomologies modulo d [18]. in particular, there are solutions of (1.3)
that have no analogue in the antield cohomology and which, therefore, do not correspond
to an integrated, gauge-invariant operator. an example is given by the curciferrari mass
term [19]

which is a solution of (1.3) in the gauge where the equation of motion for the auxiliary b-
acc c = 0, but which does not dene an integrated gauge-invariant

operator. the properties of (1.4) have been studied in [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. thus, (1.2)
and (1.3) are in general not equivalent1.

if, however, the cocycle condition (1.3) is supplemented by the requirement of nilpo-
tency of the deformed brst dierential (which is required if we want the theory to
be unitary) the curciferrari mass term is excluded. it is the purpose of this letter to
show that, quite generally, the gauged-xed cocycle condition (1.3), supplemented by the
requirement that the deformation generated by the permissible counterterms should pre-
serve (on-shell) nilpotency of the brst symmetry, is equivalent to the antield cocycle
condition (1.2), which controls the counterterms in the zinn-justin approach.

this letter is organized as follows. in the next section, we recall some salient properties
of the gauge-xed action. the equivalence of the two cocycle conditions is shown in section
3, while a discussion of trivial solutions is presented in section 4. in section 5, we review
the analysis of counterterms in the quantum noether method and show how nilpotency of
the deformed brst dierential arises in that context. finally, in an appendix we present
an analysis of the relation between the antield and the weak gauged-xed cohomology
using methods of homological algebra.

2 gauge-xed action

the starting point is the solution s[, ] of the master equation

(s, s)  2

ls
a = 0.

(2.1)

we use dewitts condensed notations. the solution s is a local functional, as are all func-
tionals without free indices occurring below. the elds a include the original elds,
the ghosts, as well as the auxiliary elds and the antighosts of the non-minimal sector.
we assume that the canonical transformation necessary for gauge-xing has already been
performed, so that the gauge-xed action is simply obtained by setting the antields equal
to zero, sg[] = s[,  = 0]. the gauge-xed brst dierential g is dened by

ga = 

rs

a

|=0,

(2.2)

where right and left derivatives are dened by f = (rf/z)z = z(lf/z).
we use the conventions of [17], but the derivations are taken to act from the left (so
sf = (s, f ) etc.). the transformation generated by g leaves the gauge-xed action
invariant because of the master equation. as a result, the functional derivatives of sg
transform into themselves:

g rsg

a = 

rsg
b

r
a (

ls

b

);

(2.3)

1we keep here the auxiliary b-eld, but similar considerations can be made if one eliminates the
auxiliary elds, since the gauge-xed brst cohomological groups are invariant under such an elimination.

2

here and below, it is understood that  is set equal to zero after the second derivatives
have been computed. the gauge-xed brst dierential is weakly nilpotent,

(g)2a =

rsg
b

l

b

(

rs

a

).

(2.4)

both (2.3) and (2.4) are direct consequences of the denition (2.2) and the master equa-
tion.

the brst dierential in the space of the elds and the antields is dened by

sf = (s, f )

(2.5)

for any f (, ). it is related to g as sa = ga + antield-dependent terms or, which
is the same, ga = sa |=0. it is strictly nilpotent, s2 = 0. it will be useful in the
sequel to give a special name to the terms linear in  in the expansion of sa,

with

sa = ga + ga + o(()2),

ga = (s, a) |linear in 

= 
b

l

b

(

rs

a

).

(2.6)

(2.7)

the action of s on the antields can also be expanded in powers of the antields. one
a + o(()2) where g is the koszul dierential associated with the

a = g

has s
gauge-xed stationary surface [17],

a + g

a = (s, 

a) |=0=

rsg
a

and where

g

a = (s, 

a) |linear in = 

b

r
a (

ls

b

).

(2.8)

(2.9)

one easily veries the relations (g)2 = 0, gg + gg = 0, (gg + gg)a + (g)2a = 0
from the denitions of the derivations g, g and g. these relations are actually the rst
ones to arise in the expansion of s2 = 0 in powers of the antields.

the canonical transformation appropriate to gauge-xing does not modify the coho-
mology of s neither in the space of local functions nor in the space of local functionals,
because it is just a change of variables. so, in the case of yangmills theory, the coho-
mology group h 0(s, f ) of the brst dierential in the space f of local functionals is still
given by the analysis of [12]. in h 0(s, f ), the superscript 0 is the total ghost number.
note, however, that the expansion s = g + g + g +    is not the standard expansion
arising prior to gauge-xing, since the degree involved here is the total antield number
that gives equal weight to each antield, irrespective of its antighost number. this is
why it is the koszul resolution associated with the gauge-xed stationary surface that

3

arises in the present analysis, and not the koszultate resolution associated with the
gauge-invariant equations of motion.

since the equations of motion following from the gauge-xed action have no gauge
invariance (by assumption), one may invoke the general results of [26, 27, 28] to assert
that

hk(g, f ) = 0,

k  2

(2.10)

where k is the total antield number used in the above expansions. in words: any local
functional a  f (a = r a) that solves ga = 0 (ga + db = 0) and is at least quadratic
in the antields has the form a = gc (a = gc + dm).

we have of course hk(g, l) = 0 for k  1 in the space l of local functions [17], but
we shall need the version valid for local functionals below. this is a direct consequence
of theorem 8.3 or 10.1 of [26], which states that there can be no non-trivial higher-
order conservation laws for an action having no gauge symmetries. this theorem is
also known as the vinogradov two-line theorem. because higher-order conservation
laws and elements of hk(g, f ) (also denoted hk(g|d)) are in bijection, the property
in general, however, the homological group h1(g, f ) does not vanish
(2.10) follows.
(even though h1(g, l) = 0 in the space of local functions) and is related to the global
symmetries of the gauge-xed action [26].

3 reconstruction theorem

we now have all the required tools to show that a local counterterm of the gauge-xed
formalism that preserves nilpotency denes a local counterterm of the antield zinn-justin
approach. that is, the condition

ga0  0

(3.1)

for the local functional a0[] = r a0 (which implies (1.3) for the integrand a0), together
with the fact that the associated deformed brst symmetry g +e should remain weakly
nilpotent (for the new equations of motion) to o(e2) in the deformation parameter e,

determines a local functional cocycle a[, ] of the antield cohomology

(g + e)2  o(e2),

sa = 0.

(3.2)

(3.3)

in (3.2), the symbol  means equal when the deformed equations of motion r(s +
ea0)/a = 0 hold. the relationship between a and a0 is

a = a0 + a1 + a2 + o(()3),

(3.4)

where a1 (respectively, a2) is linear (respectively, quadratic) in the antields.

the above derivation  is the deformation of the brst-symmetry and is related to
the deformation a0 of the action as follows. when one adds ea0 to the gauge-xed action,
sg[]  sg[] + ea0[], one modies the gauge-xed brst symmetry as g  g + e

4

in such a way that (g + e)(sg + ea0) = o(e2). the existence of  is guaranteed by
the cocycle condition (3.1), which we can rewrite as

ga0 + ga1 = 0

(3.5)

for some local functional a1 linear in the antields. we have a = a, a1 = 
where ga is the grassman parity of a.

aa(1)ga,

as (3.4) shows, the relationship between a[, ] and a0[] is that a[, ] starts like
a0[] to zeroth order in the antields. thus, the question is whether any local functional
a0 that fulls both (3.1) and (3.2) can be completed by terms of higher orders in the
antields to yield a (local functional) solution of (3.3).

the converse statement, namely, that any local functional a[, ] solution of (3.3)
denes, when setting the antields equal to zero, a cocycle of the weak cohomology (3.1)
fullling (3.2), is rather obvious. indeed, if sa = 0, then ga0  0 (term independent of
the antields in sa = 0). furthermore, at the next order,

ga0 + ga1 + ga2 = 0,

(3.6)

a relation that is seen to be equivalent to (3.2) by rephrasing the condition (3.2) in terms
of a0 and a1. on the one hand, direct calculations yield

ga1 = 

)  

a(ga)

ab l
b (

rs

(

ga0 =

).

(3.7)

on the other hand, if one replaces the weak equality by a strong equality in (g+e)2a 
o(e2), one gets, in view of (2.4),

(g + e)2a = (

rsg
b + e

ra0

for some ab. thus, (3.2) becomes to order e,

ga  b l
b (

ra0

(

rs

a

),

(3.9)

which shows that (3.2) is indeed equivalent to the statement that ga1 + ga0 vanishes
weakly, or which is the same, (3.6).

accordingly, to each counterterm of the antield zinn-justin approach corresponds a

counterterm of the brst-noether method.

conversely, given a solution of (3.1)  or (3.5)  which also fulls (3.2), the question
is whether one can construct a local functional a that starts like a0 + a1 and is brst-
invariant. that (3.1) (or (3.5)) by itself does not guarantee the existence of a is illustrated
by the curci-ferrari mass term and has been explained in [18].

the problem arises because the perturbative construction, yielding successively a2,
a3, etc., given the initial data a0 and a1 along the lines of homological perturbation

5

theory applied to the antield formalism [29, 30, 17] can be obstructed in the space of
local functionals. the obstructions are in the homological groups hk(g, f ) (also denoted
by hk(g|d)) the point is that the equations dening the higher-order terms a2, a3 etc.
take the form

gak = bk1,

(3.10)

where the local functional bk1 involves only the lower-order terms ai (i < k) and can be
shown to be g-closed. to infer that bk1 is exact, one needs either hk1(g, f ) = 0 or,
if hk1(g, f ) does not vanish, additional information guaranteeing that bk1 is in the
zero class.

as we recalled above, hj(g, f ) = 0 for j > 1. thus the only obstructions may arise
for k  1 = 1, i.e. for a2. if it can be proven that a2 exists, there cannot be any further
obstruction at the next orders, and a also exists. the strategy of the construction of a
from a0 and a1 consists, then, in showing that one avoids the obstruction for a2. it is
here that the condition (3.2) is necessary.

the equation (3.10) for a2 is actually (3.6) with

b1 = ga0  ga1.

(3.11)

we must show that b1 is g-exact, i.e. that it vanishes weakly. but this is guaranteed
because (3.6) and (3.2) have been shown to be equivalent, so that (3.2) implies (3.6) or
(3.11). therefore, the obstruction for a2 is avoided, as announced.

one may understand the equivalence between (3.2) and (3.6) more directly, in terms
of the master equation itself. as is known [31], the elements of h 0(s, f ) can be viewed
as consistent, rst-order deformations of the master equation, s  s  = s + ea, (s, s) =
0  (s , s ) = o(e2). as we have indicated, given a0, the obstruction to the construction
of a can only occur for a2, i.e. we must verify that the term (3.6) is zero. but this term is
the term linear in the antields in the master equation. so, the absence of obstruction is
equivalent to the statement that (s , s ) |linear in  vanishes, or ((s , s ), a) |=0= 0.
this is precisely the statement that the deformed brst symmetry remains nilpotent, as
the jacobi identity for the antibrackets easily shows.

4 trivial solutions

the map between the antield cohomology and the gauged-xed cohomology fails to be
surjective, since only classes with representatives fullling the extra condition (3.6) are
in the image of the map. the map fails also to be injective, because there are non-trivial
cocycles of the antield cohomology that are mapped on trivial cocycles of the gauged-
xed cohomology. this is best seen on a simple example. consider electromagnetism
with a neutral scalar eld  and impose the gauge condition a =  through the
equation of motion for the auxiliary b-eld, where  is a constant with dimension l1.
with that gauge choice, the nontrivial cocycle r d4x  of the gauge-invariant cohomology
becomes trivial in the weak gauge-xed cohomology since one has   s c + a. similar
considerations would apply to any function f () in the gauge a = f (). although

6

we will not provide a precise argument, we note that these mod-d coboundaries of the
gauge-xed cohomology, which are present in peculiar gauges, are not expected to be
physically trivial. the reason is that correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators
do not change in dierent gauges (for a proof within the eg framework, see [36]).

note that the gauge-xed action has a nontrivial global symmetry acting on the un-
physical variables, namely the shift c  c + , where  is a constant grassmann odd
parameter, corresponding to the cohomology class r d4x c . this phenomenon is precisely
related in the appendix to the non-injectivity of the above map.

5 counterterms in the quantum noether method

we show in this section how the nilpotency condition arises in the quantum noether
method. this method [15, 16] is a general method for constructing theories with global
symmetries using the epstein-glaser (eg) approach to quantum eld theory.
in this
approach, which was introduced by bogoliubov and shirkov [32] and developed by epstein
and glaser [33, 34], the (perturbative) s-matrix is directly constructed in the fock space
of asymptotic elds by imposing causality and poincare invariance. the method can be
regarded as an inverse of the cutting rules: one builds n-point functions by appropriately
gluing together m-point functions (m < n). moreover, this method directly yields a
nite perturbation theory; one avoids uv innities altogether by proper treatment of
n-point functions as operator-valued distributions. the coupling constants of the theory,
e, are replaced by tempered test functions g(x) (i.e. smooth functions rapidly decreasing
at innity), which switch on the interactions. the iterative construction of the s-matrix
starts by giving a number of free elds satisfying (gauged-xed) elds equation (so that
there are propagators) and the rst term, t1, in the perturbative expansion of the s-
matrix. ultimately, one is interested in the theory in which g(x) becomes again constant,
g(x)  e. this is the so-called adiabatic limit. we use the convention to still keep e
explicit, in which case the adiabatic limit is g(x)  1. we work before the adiabatic limit
is taken, as the latter does not always exist because of physical infrared singularities.

causality and poincare invariance completely x the s-matrix up to local terms. the
remaining local ambiguity is further constrained by symmetries.
it is the purpose of
our analysis to determine the precise restrictions imposed on these local terms by ward
identities. at tree level the local terms are equal to the lagrangian of the conventional
approach [15], but new local terms may be introduced at each order in perturbation theory.
the local terms at loop level correspond to the counterterms in the lagrangian approach,
although their role is not to subtract innities, as the perturbative expansion is already
nite.
if the form of these local terms remains the same to all orders in perturbation
theory then the theory is renormalizable.

the quantum noether method consists of adding a coupling to the noether current
j
0 that generates the asymptotic (and hence linear) symmetry in the theory and then
requiring that this current be conserved inside correlation functions. there are a number
of equivalent ways to present this condition [15, 16]. here we follow [16], where the
condition was formulated in terms of the interacting noether current. the ward identity,

7

formula (3.1) in [16], contains terms that vanish in the (naive) adiabatic limit, g(x)  1.
their explicit form, which can be found in [16], is not important for the present analysis.
here we will schematically denote them by gj. due to these terms the interacting
brst charge is not conserved before the adiabatic limit is taken. for a discussion of
the implications of this fact (and also of other diculties encountered when attempting
to construct the interacting brst charge) we refer to [35]. we note, however, that
considerations involving only currents are sucient in order to derive all consequences of
nonlinear symmetries for time-ordered products. the quantum noether condition reads

t [j
x

0 (x)t1(x1)       t1(xn)] = gj.

(5.1)

working out the consequences of this condition to all orders, one recovers the non-linear
structure in a manner similar to the way the noether method works in classical eld
theory [15, 16]. further consistency requirements on the theory follow by considering
multi-current correlation functions. in particular, the two-current equation is

t [j
x

0 (x)j

0 (y)t1(x1)    t1(xn)] = gj,

(5.2)

where again we have only schematically included terms that vanish in the naive adiabatic
limit. the explicit form of these terms, as well as an all-order analysis of (5.2), will be
presented in [36].

we are interested in gauge theories.

in this case the relevant symmetry is brst
symmetry. we now present the analysis of (5.1), (5.2) for this case to rst non-trivial
order. this is sucient in order to connect with the analysis of the preceding sections.
equation (5.1) at rst order yields the following condition on l1 = (h/i)t1 :

gl1 = l

1 + eak(0)

abb,

(5.3)

where a denotes collectively all the elds; g = [r j0, ] generates the asymptotic trans-
formation rules; a is dened by eq. (5.3). it was shown in [15, 16] that a is the
next-order symmetry transformation rule; l
1 is some local function of a and its rst
derivative a, and k(0)

abb are the free-eld equations.

to work out the consequences of condition (5.2), we rst note that since j

0 is the

gauged-xed brst current it satises

gj

0 = t 

0 + j a

0 k(0)

aba,

(5.4)

is antisymmetric in , , and j a

where t 
0 may contain derivatives acting on the free-
0
eld equations. equation (5.4) guarantees that (5.2) is satised at n = 0 (i.e. no t1
involved). at n = 1 one nds the following condition:

j a
0

l1
a + gj

1 + j

0 = t

(5.5)

for some t

1

0

1 arises as a local normalization term of the correlation function t [j

l1/a; j
0 (x1)t1(x2)].
it was shown in [16] that it is the noether current that generates the symmetry transfor-
mation rules a. combining with (5.4) we obtain

(g + e)(j

0 + ej

1 ) = (t 

0 + et 

1 ) + (j a

0 + ej a

1 )k(1)

aba + o(e2),

(5.6)

where k(1)
generates the free eld equations.

aba are the eld equations that follow from the lagrangian l0 + el1, where l0

conditions (5.3) and (5.6) are equivalent to conditions (3.1) and (3.2) we analysed in

section 3.

6 conclusions

in this letter, we have shown that the restrictions imposed on counterterms by the quan-
tum noether condition in the epsteinglaser construction of gauge theories are equivalent
to those imposed in the zinn-justin (antield) approach to the renormalization of gauge
theories. the crucial requirement that guarantees the equivalence of the restrictions on
the counterterms (cocycle conditions) is the nilpotency of the deformed brst gener-
ator. we have also analysed how this requirement arises in the eg approach. similar
considerations apply to anomalies. this will be discussed elsewhere [36].

appendix: antield (canonical) versus weak gauge-
xed brst cohomology

in this appendix, the general relation in the space of local functionals f between the an-
tield brst cohomology computed before gauge-xing and the weak gauge-xed version
is analysed by using standard tools from homological algebra.

as mentioned in section 2, the canonical transformation used for gauge-xing does
not modify the antield brst cohomology and we assume that this transformation has
been done. the complete brst dierential s in canonical form then diers from that

9

in gauge-xed form only in the grading used for the expansion, called generically reso-
lution degree below. the grading associated to the canonical form consists in assigning
antighost number 1 to the antifelds of the original elds, 2 to the antields of the ghosts,
3 to the antields of the ghosts for ghosts, etc., while in the gauge-xed case the grading
consists in assigning antield number 1 to all the antields.

in both cases, we have an expansion of the form s =  +  + pk1 s

k, in the bigraded
k , with g  z the ghost number and k  n the resolution degree. the

space v = k,gv g
ghost number of s is 1, the resolution degree of , , s

k are respectively 1, 0, k.

let vkn be the space containing only terms of resolution degree larger than n: a 
vkn if the expansion of a according to the resolution degree is a = an + an+1 + . . .. in
particular v = vk0.

for n  0, consider the spaces h g(s, vkn) dened by the cocycle condition s(an +
an+1 + . . .) = 0 and the coboundary condition an + an+1 + . . . = s(bn + bn+1 + . . .).
in particular, bn = 0. consider the maps in : h g(s, vkn+1)  h g(s, vkn) dened
by in[an+1 + an+2 + . . .] = [an+1 + an+2 + . . .]. they are well dened because they map
cocycles to cocycles and coboundaries to coboundaries. note that the dierence between
h g(s, vkn+1) and im in is the coboundary condition: an element a = an+1 + an+2 + . . .,
with sa = 0, is trivial in im in  h g(s, vkn), if a = sb with b = bn + bn+1 + . . ..

for n  0, consider the spaces h g

n(, h(, v )). the cocycle condition for an element
[an]  h g
n(, h(, v )) is an = 0, an +an+1 = 0 for some an+1, and the coboundary
condition is an = bn + bn+1, with bn = 0. consider the maps n : h g(s, vkn) 
h g

n(, h(, v )) dened by n[an + an+1 + . . .] = [an].

consider nally the maps mn : h g

n(, h(, v ))  h g+1(s, vkn+1) dened by
it is straightforward to check that the maps mn are well

mn[an] = [s(an + an+1)].
dened.

we are now in a position to prove the decomposition:

h g(s, vkn)  ker mn  im in.

(a.1)

the proof follows from the isomorphism (as real vector spaces) h g(s, vkn)  im n 
ker n and by showing that ker n = im in and im n = ker mn. from (a.1), it then
follows that

h g(s, v )  ker m0  i0[h g(s, vk1)]
 ker m0  i0[ker m1  i1[h g(s, vk2)]]  . . .
i0  . . .  in1[ker mn].

 ker m0 m
n1

(a.2)

note that the isomorphism h g(s, vkn)  im n ker n used in the proof is non-canonical
in the sense that it involves a choice of supplementary subspace to ker n.

discussion:

if v is the space of local functions or of horizontal forms, we have
hn(, v ) = 0 for n  1, and this both in the canonical and the gauge-xed form. it follows
n(, h(, v )) = 0 and thus ker mn = 0 for n  1. since h g+1(s, vk1) = 0 it also
that h g
follows that m0 = 0 and ker m0 = h g
0 (, h(, v )).
this result has been deduced in [29, 17].

0 (, h(, v )), so that h g(s, v )  h g

10

if v is the space of local functionals f , for the canonical form of the brst dierential
(with the cohomologically trivial pairs of the non-minimal sector eliminated), there are
no elds with negative pure ghost numbers. this implies that the antield number must
be larger than or equal to max(0, g) = k. furthermore, if k > k, the presence of
the ghosts implies [37] that h g
k (, f ) = 0. this implies, for g  0, that h g
k (, f ) = 0 for
k  1, hence ker mn = 0, for n  1 and m0 = 0. again we get h g(s, f )  h g
0 (, h(, f )).
g(, f ). this implies
h g
n(, h(, f )) = 0, for n 6= g, so that ker mn = 0 for n 6= g. furthermore,
h g+1(s, fkg+1) = 0, so that mg = 0. hence h g(s, f )  i0. . .ig1[h g
g(, h(, f ))].
finally, h g
g (, f ) = 0, and ig1 =
. . . = i0 = 1 at ghost number g, since there are no terms with antield number less than
g, so that h g(s, f )  h g

for g < 0, the only non-vanishing cohomology group is h g

g(, f ), which is the result obtained in [12].

g(, h(|d))  h g

g(|d), which follows from h g+1

as already stated in section 2, in the space of local functionals for the gauge-xed form,
h g
k (g, f ) = 0 for k  2, with h g
1 (g, f ) characterizing the non-trivial global symmetries
of the gauge-xed action (and their associated noether currents) for the classical elds,
the ghost elds and the elds of the gauge-xing sector. we thus have ker m2 = ker m3 =
. . . = 0 and m1 = 0, implying that

h g(s, f )  [ker m0  h g

0 (g, h(g, f ))]  i0[h g

1 (g, h(g, f ))].

(a.3)

it follows that the canonical antield brst cohomology h g(s, f ) is isomorphic to the
direct sum of a subset of the weak gauge-xed brst cohomology h g
0 (g, h(g, f ))
and of a subset of the nontrivial global symmetries of the gauge-xed action. since
h g+1(s, fk1)  h g+1
(, h(, f )), the condition that [a0]  ker m0 becomes s1a0+a1 =
b1 + b2, with b1 = 0. this is precisely condition (3.6) and thus equivalent to (3.2).
