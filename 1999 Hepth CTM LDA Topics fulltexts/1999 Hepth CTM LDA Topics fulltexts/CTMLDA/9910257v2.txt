abstract

we consider an abelian gauge theory with spontaneously broken
symmetry containing a scalar-fermion coupling which is non-linear in
the higgs eld. although in the unitary gauge it reduces to a pure
yukawa term, suggesting that the theory is renormalizable, the one
loop divergence structure in this gauge in the fermion-fermion elastic
scattering amplitude shows this is not so. comparison is made with
the theory with a conventional coupling, for which cancellation of the
non-renormalizable divergences occurs.

some years ago it was proposed in ref. [1] a class of pure left su(n)u(1)
gauge theories with spontaneously broken symmetry, capable of accommo-
dating the weinberg-salam model and some of its generalizationsa up to the
higgs sector. they exhibit the unfamiliar feature of using a scalar-fermion
coupling non-linear in the higgs elds, specially designed, however, to re-
duce to a yukawa term in the unitary gauge. it is natural to ask whether
such a construction is generally compatible with renormalizability. we show

asee discussions in ref. 1.

here, by pointing to a simple abelian model, that renormalizability can be
lost.

consider the u(1) theory given by the lagrangian l = l1 + l2, with the

rst term corresponding to the goldstone model (2,  > 0)

with ,  real. the fermion-higgs coupling is of the type mentioned above:
it is not linear in , while in the unitary gauge  = 0 it reduces to a genuine
yukawa term.

the non-linearity associated with  makes unitary gauge a most conve-
nient choice for writing the feynman rules. let mf , m denote the masses
(in the tree approximation) acquired by the fermion and vectorial eld after
symmetry breaking, and let 
2 represent the shifted  eld with zero vacuum
expectation value. then the interaction lagrangian is

and the feynman rules can be read o from the eective interaction hamil-

using the covariant vector eld propagator d(k) = (g +kk/m 2)/(k2 
m 2 + i).
now,

it is generally accepted [3] that despite the bad ultraviolet be-
haviour of the massive vectorial propagators in unitary gauge, renormal-
izability should still allow the s matrix divergences to be absorbed into a

proper set of counterterms (which is not the case for arbitrary green func-
tions). when calculating physical quantities, the hidden gauge symmetry is
expected to lead in to the cancellation of the non-renormalizable divergences
in individual graphs. it turns out this fails to happen for our theory.

consider the g4 contribution to the fermion-fermion elastic scattering.
the corresponding feynman graphs are displayed in the figure. we have
not shown (i) diagrams which dier only by an external line permutation,
(ii) tadpole and external line self-energy diagrams (as taken care by mass
and wave function renormalization), and (iii) diagrams involving only   
interactions. the last ones can be easily seen to contain only renormalizable
divergences.

the result of a straightforward calculation can be summarized as follows.
the following pairs of diagrams are nite, though each diagram is separately
divergent: (a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h), (i, j). diagrams (k), (l) prove to
be individually nite. vertex diagrams (m), (n) are logarithmically, while
(o), (p), (q) and (r) quadratically divergent. the divergences turn out to be
momentum-independent, so that in principle they can be cured by coupling
constant (eventually mf , m) renormalization. quadratical divergences in
diagrams (s), (t) correspond to vector eld mass and wave function renor-
malization. one is left with the quartically divergent self-energy graph (u).
its contribution reads

f = 2g4m2

this suces to prove our point.

it is interesting to consider the same process in the theory modied to
it is not hard to see that the only way to
allow a conventional coupling.
do this without changing the particle spectrum (or destroying relativistic
invariance) is to resort to the familiar choice with chiral components of 
behaving dierently under gauge transformations. one can set, without loss
of generality,

l  eigl, r  r,

(11)

where l, r are the left and right handed projections, respectively. this
does not aect l1, but maintaining u(1) gauge invariance requests replacing
l2 with

l2 = i (  ig

(12)

the resulting l = l1 + l2 theory is just the appelquist and quinn
model [5] used in the early days of electroweak theory to test divergence
cancellations in unitary gauge calculations. in this gauge, the s matrix still
follows from the eective hamiltonian (6) with the sole modication in lint
concerning the spinor-vector coupling

this proves essential for divergence cancellations. situation now presents as
follows (the contributing feynamn graphs in both theories are obviously the
same). diagrams (a) and (b) summed yield a logarithmic divergence which
equals f n r
. diagrams (k) and (l) produce logarithmic and quadratically
divergences which added yield, for each diagram, f n r
. these four diagrams
thus exactly cancel the divergence in diagram (u). the rest of diagrams
prove to contain either renormalizable innities, or non-renormalizable ones
corresponding to a pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar four-fermion interaction, which
again cancel among themselvesb





in conclusion, our example shows one should be cautious in extending the
renormalizability result [7] concerning ssb gauge theories when including in

bsee ref. 5. cancellation of the one-loop non-renormalizable divergences was also

checked in ref. 6, though not by a direct evaluation of individual graphs.
