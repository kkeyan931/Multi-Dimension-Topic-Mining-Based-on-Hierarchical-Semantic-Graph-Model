abstract

we dispute a recent claim for a nonperturbative nonrenormalisation theorem
stating that mass cannot be spontaneously generated in supersymmetric qed.
we also extend a long-standing perturbative result, namely that the eective
potential is zero to all orders of perturbation theory, to the nonperturbative
regime for arbitrary numbers of avours.

i. introduction

the supersymmetric (susy) nonrenormalisation theorem for mass to all orders in per-
turbation theory has been established for some time [13]. several authors [46] have inves-
tigated the possibility of a nonperturbative nonrenormalisation theorem in susy quantum
electrodynamics (sqed), which asserts that the chiral solution to the dyson-schwinger
equation (dse) in sqed is not merely favoured but unique, ie. that there is no achiral
solution. the rst was clark and love [4] who, using the supereld formalism and after
truncating diagrams containing seagull and higher order n-point vertices, found that the
eective mass m contains a prefactor   1 which vanishes in feynman gauge. reasoning
that if the mass vanishes in one gauge then it must vanish in all gauges, they conclude
that there can be no dynamic chiral symmetry breaking in sqed, even beyond the rainbow
approximation.

this approach was criticized by kaiser and selipsky on two grounds [5]. firstly they
argue that the truncation of seagull diagrams is too severe as it ignores contributions even
at the one-loop level. secondly they point out that innities arising from the infrared
divergences which plague the supereld formalism can counter the vanishing prefactor and
allow spontaneous mass generation. they also point out that the original nonrenormalisation
theorem did not forbid mass corrections, only innite mass counter-terms.

the issue was taken up by campbell-smith and mavromatos [6] who investigated chiral
symmetry breaking in 2 + 1 dimensional sqed (sqed3) using superelds with both two-
and four-component spinors. in the four-component theory [6] they also nd a nonrenor-
malisation theorem. their analysis dimensionally reduces sqed4 to sqed3, introducing a
compactication scale in the process. after truncating all two-particle irreducible diagrams

from the dse, taking the limit that all momenta are small compared to the momentum
scale of the compactication, and making several other approximations, they nd the same
prefactor in front of the eective mass as clark and love, and claim that its cancellation
by infrared divergences is subverted by the lack of a corresponding prefactor in the renor-
malisation factor z. since their argument depends on dimensional reduction of sqed4, it
cannot be applied in 3 + 1 dimensions.

our analysis in the component formalism nds no evidence for such a theorem. it is

certainly the case that no vanishing gauge dependent prefactor emerges.

the cjt eective potential [7] expresses the potential of a theory as a functional of its
propagators and can be used to compare the chiral and achiral propagators in ordinary eld
theories. it has been known for some time that in perturbation theory [8,9] the eective
potential is exactly zero to all orders in a susy theory. (pisarski has adapted these proofs
to the many avour limit in the nonperturbative theory [10].) however, a rigorous result
in perturbation theory cannot be assumed to hold in the nonperturbative regime. so while
the favoured solution must have a potential of exactly zero since susy is unbroken [11], it
is still reasonable to ask if the unfavoured one does not.

there has been some confusion regarding the calculation of the cjt eective potential
(for example see [12]) in susy theories. this arises from the fact that it is not clear
how to treat greens functions with auxiliary elds. this problem was solved in a previous
paper [13], and substituting the propagators from that paper into the cjt eective potential
yields that it is uniformly zero. this renders the cjt eective potential ineective for
choosing between solutions to the dse in the absence of susy breaking.

sec. ii gives our argument against the existence of a nonperturbative nonrenormalisation
theorem. substituting in the most general possible form for the three-point vertices [13], we
nd that it is impossible to nd an acceptable ansatz in which the eective mass must be
zero. however we do not succeed in nding an achiral solution so the (remote) possibility
that the dse cannot be solved with a dressed mass remains open.

our analysis of the cjt eective potential, in which we show that it is uniformly zero,

is presented in sec. iii. this result is not spoiled by vacuum polarisation.

where the scalar functions taa(p2, q2, p  q), taf (p2, q2, p  q), tf f (p2, q2, p  q) are symmetric
in p, q due to charge conjugation invariance [13] but are unconstrained by either the ward-
takahashi or susy ward identities. in a slight abuse of language we refer to these functions
as transverse functions since they contribute only to the transverse components of the ver-
tices. the contribution to b(p2) from the transverse components of the vertices is referred to
as the transverse contribution. eqs. (2.16,2.17) were derived in the quenched approximation.
the eects of vacuum polarisation will be considered shortly.

considering rst the minimal susy ball-chiu ansatz where the transverse functions are
set to zero, we see immediately that there is no reason why b(p2) must vanish. we can also
eliminate the possibility of the transverse functions inducing a nonrenormalisation theorem
by cancelling o the minimal contribution. to see this, recall that the transverse functions
are symmetric in p and q and examine the coecients of daf (q2).
its coecients in the
minimal contribution are asymmetric in p, q because of the a(p2) factor whereas those in
the transverse contribution are exactly symmetric. (a corresponding argument for terms in
eq. (2.16) proportional to daa(q2) cannot be made because the transverse contribution has
an asymmetric component.) it follows that the integrand of b(p2) will not vanish, regardless
of the choice of transverse functions. this result will still hold after angular integration as the
transverse contribution will be a symmetric function multiplied by qd1 whereas the minimal
contribution will not. however we cannot eliminate the possibility that eqs. (2.16,2.17) may
simply not be solvable unless b(p2) is set to zero.

this apparent contradiction between ourselves and previous supereld analyses [4,6]
requires explanation. if an achiral solution is forbidden in the supereld formalism then it
must also be forbidden in the component formalism, and yet our analysis nds no evidence
that an achiral solution cannot exist. we can eliminate the possibility that our choice of the
quenched approximation has obscured a nonrenormalisation theorem. indeed, the photon
propagator is of the general form

d(p) 

1
p2 (g 

pp
p2 )

1

1 + (p2)

+ 

pp
p4

,

(2.18)

where (p2) is the vacuum polarisation. the photino and d propagators are then restricted
by susy to be [14]

s(p) =

dd(p2) =

i

p2

1 + (p2)

respectively.
in the absence of approximations we can condently choose to work in a
specic gauge, and in landau gauge ( = 0) the right hand sides of eqs. (2.16,2.17) are
simply multiplied by a factor of

1+(p2), which preserves our result.

it would seem that the vanishing gauge dependent prefactor in superspace treat-
ments [4,6] is an artifact of the extensive approximations used. the approximations in [6]
were generally chosen so as to have minimal impact in the infrared region where chiral sym-
metry breaking is largely determined, but to combine such approximations with a gauge
dependent argument is dangerous. consider, for example, the equivalent of eq. (2.16) in
non-susy qed3 in the quenched rainbow approximation,

b(p2) = ( + 2)

e2

42p z 

0

dq

qb(q2)

q2a2(q2) + b2(q2)

(ln|p + q|  ln|p  q|).

(2.21)

in the special gauge of  = 2 the right hand side of eq. (2.21) vanishes unless a(q2) and
b(q2) conspire to cancel this prefactor. it does not follow though that chiral symmetry is
unbroken. in fact non-susy qed3 is known to break chiral symmetry from lattice stud-
ies [15,16]. the vanishing prefactor in eq. (2.21) is an artifact of the rainbow approximation.

iii. the cjt effective potential in the nonperturbative

regime

finding the cjt eective potential for any theory obviously requires the correct form
of the propagators. the correct form of the selectron propagators in susy theories is
made a little obscure by the auxiliary elds f, g and was obtainable only with the recent
realisation [13] that the free lagrangian becomes quadratic when the selectrons a, f (b, g)

form a column matrix [a]    a
f!

0d(p)dd(p2))).

(3.2)

(the calculation in [12] used ordinary scalar propagators daa(p2).)

substituting
eqs. (2.2) to (2.5) and eqs. (2.18) to (2.20) into eq. (3.2) reveals that the cjt eective
potential is zero at its extrema, and therefore uniformly zero. note that there is another
term in eq. (3.2), given by

d3p
(2)3

d3q
(2)3

z

d(q)tr([

aaa a(p, p, q)][d(p2)]),

(3.3)

where [
aaa a] is the four-point vertex for two [a]s and two photons, corresponding to
the vacuum graphs that give rise to the tadpole contributions in the boson dse. as we
have written it, eq. (3.2) only gives half of these particular diagrams. however, eq. (3.3) is
proportional to the massless tadpole integral and is therefore zero by dimensional regulari-
sation [17].

so pisarskis result is not restricted to the many avour limit, ie. the nonrenormalisation
theorem for the eective potential also applies nonperturbatively. it is trivial to extend our
result to arbitrary numbers of avours and it follows that the cjt eective potential cannot
be used to select the dynamically favoured propagator in a susy theory without susy
breaking.

iv. conclusion

there is no reason to suppose the nonexistence of an achiral solution to the dse in
either sqed3 or sqed4, and no nonperturbative nonrenormalisation theorem in either of
these theories. the apparent theorem found in supereld treatments is an artifact of the
substantial approximations required by the form of the dse in the supereld notation. it
must be admitted, however, that an actual achiral solution has so far eluded us so we have
yet to prove that such a solution actually exists, although there is no evidence that it doesnt.
nor have we addressed the issue of whether it is the chiral or the achiral solution that
is dynamically favoured. we have demonstrated, however, that the cjt eective potential
cannot be used to determine this in the absence of susy breaking since it is uniformly zero,
even in the nonperturbative regime.
