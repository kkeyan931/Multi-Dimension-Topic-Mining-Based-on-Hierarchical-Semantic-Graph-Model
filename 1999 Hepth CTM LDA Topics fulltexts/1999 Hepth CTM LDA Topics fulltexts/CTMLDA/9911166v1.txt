abstract

we consider the modied supereld constraints with constant terms for the d=3,
n =2 goldstone-maxwell gauge multiplet which contains goldstone fermions , real
scalar and vector elds. the partial spontaneous breaking n =2  n =1 is possible for
the non-minimal self-interaction of this modied gauge supereld including the linear
fayet-iliopoulos term. the dual description of the partial breaking in the model of the
self-interacting goldstone chiral supereld is also discussed.

1 goldstone-maxwell supereld

models with the partial spontaneous breaking of the global d=3, n=2 supersymmetry have
been constructed using the topologically non-trivial classical solutions preserving the one half
of supercharges [1] and also in the method of nonlinear realizations of supersymmetries using
superelds of the unbroken n=1 supersymmetry [2]. these models describe interactions of
the goldstone fermions with the complex scalar eld of the supermembrane or with the real
scalar and vector elds of the d2-brane.

the standard linear supermultiplets (standard superelds) are not convenient for a
description of the partial spontaneous breaking of the extended global supersymmetries
(p sbgs) when the invariance with respect to the part of supercharges remains unbroken.
the partial breaking of the n=2 supersymmetry means a degeneracy of the matrix of vac-
uum supersymmetric transformations of two real fermions in some supermultiplet , however,
this is impossible for the standard structure of auxiliary components in the vector or chiral
superelds. nevertheless, the linear n=2 transformations with the partial breaking can be
constructed in terms of the n=1 superelds [2]. we shall show that these representations
with the linear goldstone (lg) fermions correspond to the modied constraints for the
goldstone-type superelds in the n=2 superspace.

the goldstone-maxwell chiral supereld w in the d=4, n=2 superspace satises the
modied supereld 2-nd order constraints [3, 4]. in comparison to the original constraints
of the n=2 vector multiplet [5], the deformed constraints contain the constant terms which
guarantee the appearance of the unusual constant imaginary part of the isovector auxiliary
component and the goldstone fermion component in the gauge supereld. this abelian
gauge model has been used to break spontaneously d=4, n=2 supersymmetry to its n=1
subgroup.

the more early example of the goldstone-type constraint has been considered in the
model with the partial breaking of the d=1, n=4 supersymmetry [6]. thus, these con-
straints introduce a new type of the supersymmetry representations with the lg-fermions.
in distinction with the goldstone fermions of the nonlinear realizations which transforms
linearly only in the unbroken supersymmetry, the lg-fermions have their partners in the
supermultiplets of the whole supersymmetry. the nonlinear deformation of the standard
constraints is also possible [7], however, we shall discuss only constant terms in the modi-
ed constraints which are connected with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetries. it
will be shown that the models with the lg vector multiplet and the corresponding dual
scalar multiplet solve the problem of the partial spontaneous breaking of the d=3, n=2
supersymmetry.

in this section we discuss the prepotential solution for the lgm supermultiplet which
contains additional terms manifestly depending on the spinor coordinates and some complex
constants playing the role of moduli in the vacuum state of the theory together with the con-
stant of the fayet-iliopoulos (f i) term. using this representation in the non-minimal gauge
action one can obtain the constant vacuum solutions with the partial spontaneous breaking
of the d=3, n=2 supersymmetry. note that the supersymmetry algebra is modied on the
lgm prepotential v by analogy with the similar modied transformations of the 4d gauge
elds or prepotentials in refs.[4, 11].

the sect.2 is devoted to the description of p sbgs in the interaction of the lg-chiral
supereld which is dual to the interaction of the lgm supereld. this manifestly supersym-
metric action depends on the sum of the chiral and antichiral superelds and some constant
term bilinear in the spinor coordinates. the non-usual transformation of the basic lg-chiral
supereld satises the supersymmetry algebra with the central-charge term.

the n=1 supermembrane and d2-brane actions [2] can be analysed in our approach
using the decompositions of n=2 superelds in the 2-nd spinor coordinate 
2 . we consider
the n=1 components of the extended superelds and the covariant conditions which allow
us to express the additional degrees of freedom in terms of the goldstone superelds.

the coordinates of the full d=3, n=2 superspace are

z = (x, , ) ,

(1.1)

where ,  are the spinor indices of the group sl(2, r). the spinor representation of the coor-
dinate is connected with the vector representation via the 3d -matrices x=(1/2)xm(m).
the spinor derivatives in this superspace have the following form:

d = d +

where z is the real central charge, and d and d are the spinor derivatives without the
central charge.

the n=2 supersymmetry algebra is covariant with respect to the ur(1) transformations

of the spinor coordinates.

we shall consider the following notation for the bilinear combinations of spinor coordi-

nates and dierential operators:

(1.12)

the d=3, n=2 gauge theory [8, 9, 10] is analogous to the well-known d=4, n=1
gauge theory, although the three-dimensional case has some interesting peculiarities which
are connected with the existence of the topological mass term and duality between the 3d-
vector and chiral multiplets. we shall consider the basic superspace with z=0.

the abelian u(1)-gauge prepotential v (z) possesses the gauge transformation v = + 

where  is the chiral parameter.

the d=3, n=2 vector multiplet is described by the real linear supereld

w (v ) = i(d d)v

(1.13)

satisfying the basic constraints (d)2w = ( d)2w = 0.

the components of w (v ) are the real scalar , the eld-strength of the gauge eld

f(a), the real auxiliary component g and the spinor elds  and .

3

the low-energy eective action of the 3d vector multiplet describes a non-minimal inter-
action of the real scalar eld with the fermion and gauge elds. for the u(1) gauge supereld
v this action has the following general form:

s(w ) = 

1

2 z d7zh(w ) ,

 (w ) = h (w ) > 0 ,

(1.14)

where h(w ) is the real convex function of w .

let us consider the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry in the non-minimal gauge

model (1.14) with the additional linear f i-term

sf i =

1
2

 z d7zv ,

(1.15)

where  is a constant of the dimension 1. varying the supereld v one can derive the
corresponding supereld equation of motion. we shall study the constant solutions of this
equation using the following vacuum ansatz:

v0 = 2i( )a  2()2()2g ,

w0 = a + 2i( )g ,

(1.16)

it is useful to consider the real spinors 

where a and g are constants. the non-trivial solution g06=0 is possible for the quadratic
function h only.
k and the real spinor parameters of the n=2
supersymmetry by analogy with (1.9). it is clear that the constant solution g06=0 can only
break spontaneously both supersymmetries.
consider the following deformation of the linearity constraints which denes the lgm

supereld:

(1.17)
where c and c are some constants. these relations are manifestly supersymmetric, however,
they break the ur(1) invariance.

(d)2 w = c ,

( d)2 w = c ,

the gauge-prepotential solution of these constraints can be constructed by analogy with

eq.(1.13)

w = i(d d)v + ()2c + ()2 c .

(1.18)

this supereld contains new constant auxiliary structures which change radically the ma-
trix of the vacuum fermion transformations 
k . it is evident that the p sbgs-condition
corresponds to the degeneracy of these transformations

c c  g2

0 = 0 .

(1.19)

in this case one can choose the single real goldstone spinor eld as some linear combination
of 
k .
the action of the lgm-supereld (1.18) has the following form:

s(v ) = 

1

2 z d7z[h( w )  v ]

(1.20)

and depends on three constants , c and c.

the non-derivative terms in the component lagrangian produce the following scalar

potential

v() =

1
2

[|c|2 () + 2 1()] .

(1.21)

the p sbgs solution (1.19) arises for the non-trivial interaction  (a)6=0. this solution

determines the minimum point a0 of this model

 (a0) = ||
|c|

.

the vacuum auxiliary eld can be calculated in the point a0

g0 =



 (a0)

= |c| .

(1.22)

(1.23)

using the ur(1) transformation one can choose the pure imaginary constant c  c = i|c|
(without the loss of generality) then g0 = ic = |c|.

this choice corresponds to the following decomposition of the lgm-supereld (1.18)

w = ws(vs) + 2i|c|(22) ,
ws(vs) =

(d1d1

 + d2d2

)vs .

i
4

(1.24)

(1.25)

where vs is the shifted lgm-prepotential which has the vanishing vacuum solution for the
auxiliary component. it is evident that this representation breaks spontaneously the 2-nd
supersymmetry only.

it should be stressed that the shifted quantities ws and vs are not standard superelds

(1.27)

the supersymmetry algebra of the vs-transformations is essentially modied by the anal-

ogy with the transformations of the prepotentials in refs.[4, 11].

it should be remarked that the minimal interaction of the charged chiral superelds with
the lgm-prepotential vs breaks the supersymmetry. the analogous problem of the lgm
interaction with the charged matter appears also in the p sbgs model with d=4, n=2
supersymmetry [4].

2 goldstone chiral supereld

the 3d linear multiplet is dual to the chiral multiplet . the legendre transform describing
this duality is

s[b, ] = 

1

2 z d7z[h(b)  b] ,

(2.1)

where b is the real unconstrained supereld and = + . varying the lagrange multipliers
 and  one can obtain the linearity constraints for b.

we shall show that the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry is possible for the non-
trivial interaction of the lg chiral supereld which possesses the inhomogeneous supersym-
metry transformation. let us consider the dual picture for the p sbgs gauge model with
the f i-term (1.20)

s(b, , ) = 

1

2 z d7z[h(b)  b ] 

1
2

[ c z d3x(d)2 + c.c.] ,

(2.2)

where the modied constrained lg supereld is introduced

   +  + 2i( ) ,

(d d)  = i .

(2.3)

varying the chiral and antichiral lagrange multipliers  and  one can obtain the lgm-
constraints (1.17) on the supereld b and then pass to the gauge phase b  w (v ) where
the ( )-term in  transforms to the f i-term.

the algebraic b-equation

provides the transform to the chiral phase

h (b)  f (b) =  ,

the transformed chiral action is

b  f 1( )  b( ) .

1

2 z d7z{ h( ) + [ c()2 + c.c.] } ,

s( ) = 
h( ) = h[ b( )]   b( )

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

the linear terms with c and c break the ur(1)-symmetry , however, this action is invariant
with respect to the isometry transformation.

it should be underlined that the lg-supereld  transforms homogeneously, while the
supersymmetry transformation of the lg-chiral lagrange multiplier  contains the inhomo-
geneous term

 .
consider the -decomposition of the lg-chiral supereld

 = i() + i

k qk

 = a(xl) + (xl) + ()2f (xl) ,

where xl is the coordinate of the chiral basis.

(2.8)

(2.9)

the lie bracket of the modied supersymmetry transformation (2.8) contains the com-
posite central charge parameter corresponding to the following action of the generator z on
the chiral supereld:

z =  ,

(z  = ) .

(2.10)

thus, the goldstone boson eld im a(x) for the central-charge transformation appears in
this model.
it should be remarked that the isometry transformation in the chiral model
without p sbgs cannot be identied with the central charge.

the vacuum equations of motion for this model have the following form:

f  (b) + c = 0 ,
(|f|2  2) (b) = 0 ,

b = a + a

 = h  =  1 .

the scalar potential of this model depends on the one real scalar component only

v(b) =

1
2

[2 (b) + |c|2 1(b)] .

(2.11)
(2.12)

(2.13)

the vacuum solution |f0|2 = 2 corresponds to the degeneracy condition for the matrix
of vacuum supersymmetry transformations. the choice f0 = i breaks the 2-nd supersym-
metry.

6

thus, the non-trivial interaction of the lg-chiral supereld  provides the partial spon-
taneous breaking of the d=3, n=2 supersymmetry. this phenomenon has been analysed
also in the formalism of the d=3, n=1 goldstone-type superelds [2].

let us assume that the spinor coordinates 

1 parameterize n=1 superspace, and the

generators q1

 form the corresponding subalgebra of the n=2 supersymmetry.

the chirality condition in the real basis

(d1

 + id2

) = 0

can be solved via the complex unrestricted n=1 supereld 

 = (x, 1) + i

2 d1

(x, 1) + (22)(d1d1)(x, 1) .

(2.14)

(2.15)

the transformation (2.8) generates the corresponding transformation of the complex

n=1 supereld:

 =

1 (2 + i1)  i

2 d1

(2.16)

consider the 2-decomposition of the basic supereld (2.3) of the chiral p sbgs model

 =  +  + i
=  + 

2 d1

2 d1

(  ) + (22)(d1d1)( + ) + i[(11) + (22)]

 + (22)[(d1d1) + 2i] ,

(2.17)

where  is the massive real n=1 supereld and  is the real goldstone supereld for the
2-nd supersymmetry.

the n=1 superelds with the analogous n=2 transformations have been proposed in
ref.[2]. the authors of this work have shown that the additional supereld can be con-
structed in terms of the spinor derivative of the goldstone supereld  in order to built the
supermembrane action. in our approach, the massive degrees of freedom can be removed
using the covariant condition

2 = 0 ,

(2.18)

which allows us to construct  via d1
d=4, n=2 theory [12].

 by analogy with the similar construction in the

let us analyse the n=1 decomposition of the gauge prepotential

vs(x, 1, 2) = (x, 1) + i

2 v(x, 1) + i(22)m(x, 1)

(2.19)

and the chiral gauge parameter  = exp(i

2 d1

)(x, 1).

the gauge transformations of the n=1 components are

 =  +  ,

v = d1

(  ) .

(2.20)

thus,  is a pure gauge degree of freedom, v is the n=1 gauge supereld, and m is the
scalar n=1 component of the n=2 supermultiplet.

consider the n=1 decomposition of the linear supereld (1.25)
2 f(v )  (22)(d1d1)w ,
where the gauge-invariant scalar and spinor superelds are dened

ws(vs) = w + i

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

the goldstone transformation of ws (1.26) produces the 2-transformations of the n=1
superelds. the spinor supereld strength f is analogous to the goldstone spinor supereld
of ref.[2]. it describes the goldstone degree of freedom of the d2-brane, and the supereld w
corresponds to the massive degrees of freedom. our construction introduces the n=1 gauge
supereld v as the basic object of this model and allows us to study the modication of
the supersymmetry algebra on the gauge elds of the d2-brane.
