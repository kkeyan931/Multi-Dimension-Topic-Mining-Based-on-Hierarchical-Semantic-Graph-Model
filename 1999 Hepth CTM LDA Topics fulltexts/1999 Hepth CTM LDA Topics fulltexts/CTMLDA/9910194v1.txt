abstract

the d1/d5 system is considered in the presence of the ns b eld. an explicit
supergravity solution in the asymptotically at and near horizon limits is presented. explicit
mass formulae are presented in both cases. this solution has no d3 source branes and
represents a true bound state of the d1/d5 system. we study the motion of a separated
d1-brane in the background geometry described above and reproduce the liouville potential
that binds the d1 brane. a gauge theory analysis is also presented in the presence of fayet-
iliopoulos (fi) parameters which can be identied with the self-dual part of the ns b eld.
in the case of a single d5-brane and an arbitrary number of d1 branes we can demonstrate
the existence of a bound state in the higgs branch. we also point out the connection of the
scft on the resolved symq1q5( t 4) with recent developments in non-commutative yang-
mills theory.

1 introduction

the d1/d5 system of type iib string theory compactied on s1t 4 (or type iia on s1k 3)
has been the subject of many investigations since it was introduced by strominger and vafa

[1] in their work on the microscopic origin of the entropy of the corresponding black hole

solution in (4+1)-dimensions. this system is amenable to a rather precise analysis because
its dynamics in the limit   0 is described by a non-abelian gauge theory. this fact
underlies the hope that a correctly understood and calculable theory of hawking radiation

can emerge for the near extremal 5-dim. black hole. this hope is realized for the emissivity

of the massless modes upto an over all numerical constant which can be xed by assuming

the ads/cft duality [2].

it turns out that the infra-red dynamics of d1/d5 system is described by a 2-dimensional

superconformal sigma model whose target space is the moduli space of yang-mills instantons

on t 4 or k 3.

in this paper we will will restrict ourselves to t 4. this scft has a

singularity corresponding to the vanishing size of instantons which corresponds to the origin

of the higgs branch. the singularity is resolved by turning on any one of the four exactly

marginal operators which correspond to the blow-up modes. in the scft with target space
symq1q5( t 4) 1, these 4 operators arise from the twisted sector corresponding to a single non-
trivial cycle of length 2 and are denoted by 0 and 1 in [3]. using a global symmetry of the
scft these were identied in [3] to be dual to the four supergravity elds: b(+) (self-dual

part of the ns 2-form b) and ac (0) + bc (4) (a linear combination of the ramond-ramond

forms c (0) and c (4)). seiberg and witten [4] have shown that the singularity of the higgs

branch corresponds to the decay of the marginally stable bound system of d1/d5 branes to

sub-systems of d1/d5 branes. turning on any 4 marginal operators evades the singularity

of the higgs branch, because the marginally stable bound state is now expected to become

a true bound state.

this fact can be argued in various ways and if we assume the ads/cft conjecture it

certainly implies the existence of a black hole solution in the bulk where the moduli elds

corresponding to the blowing up modes are non-zero. such a black hole will be stable against
fragmentation into constituents. in this paper we present such a solution for which b 6= 0
(in particular, b(+)|brane 6= 0). a preliminary version was already reported in [5]. we present
1symkm denotes the symmetric product m k/s(k) where s(k) is the permutation group of k elements.
the tilde on t 4 is a reminder that the 4-torus is not necessarily identical to the original t 4 [2].

2

a detailed analysis of the charges, both at innity and at the horizon, to ensure that the

system is indeed d1/d5 and there are no source d3-branes. given this new solution we

repeat the analysis in [4] and study the motion of a test d1 brane in the background of this

solution. we demonstrate the liouville potential that binds the d1 brane to a large number

of d1/d5 branes. the coecient of the liouville potential is proportional to b2, where b is

the self-dual part of the ns b eld at the horizon.

the discussion of the bound state in the context of the microscopic theory can be done
eciently by approximating the instanton sector of the 5-brane gauge theory by the n = 4,
u(q1) u(q5) gauge theory in 2 dims [6, 7]. we analyse the d-atness (adhm) equations
when the fayet-iliopoulos (fi) parameters are non-zero, and indicate that the (1, 5) and
(5, 1) strings condense on the hyper-kahler manifold t cp n 1, where n = q1q5. we then

discuss the transverse uctuations of the brane system (case q5 = 1) and show that these do

not have at directions transverse to the brane system. if the fi parameters are non-zero.

this demonstrates a normalizable ground state of the higgs branch.

as this work was getting completed we became aware of the recent developments in non-

commutative geometry and string theory: [8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 12, 14, 13, 16, 18, 19, 15]. the

presence of the b in the world volume of a collection of d-branes changes the boundary

conditions of the open strings that mediate the interactions of the branes. the eect of
this is that the yang-mills (ym) theory in 6-dimensions in t 4  s1  r1 that describes the
collective modes of the d1/d5 system is now replaced by a noncommutative ym theory

(ncym), with the noncommutativity parameter determined by b, as explained in [9]. the

moduli space to consider should now be that of the self-dual gauge elds in ncym on the
four-torus: f () = 0, where f denotes the ncym eld strength and the superscript ()

denotes anti-self-dual part, taken with respect to an appropriate (open string) metric. these

conditions once again preserve 8 susys and can be considered as a deformation of the

original self dual equations.

in case of the ym theory in r4, nekrasov and schwarz [20] have shown, by an analysis of
the adhm equations, that the moduli space of f () = 0 is equivalent to a resolution of the
moduli space of the ordinary f () = 0 by the b(+)
ij
case of the torus t 4 or k 3 we are unaware of a similar precise statement but an educated
guess is the following: the moduli space of f ()
ij = 0 on the torus is a resolution of the
symmetric product: symq1q5( t 4). in applications, for instance, when one constructs the

(fayet-iliopoulos) parameters. for the

3

orbifold cft on the symmetric product one implicitly assumes that a certain ux persists

in the squashed 2 cycles. this ux corresponds to turning on the operator 0 in [3]. we

conjecture that the scft obtained by further adding the 3 operators 1, with arbitrary

values of the corresponding moduli, is the scft where target space is the moduli space of
f ()

ij = 0.

the paper is organized as follows: we rst construct in section 2, the supergravity

solution that corresponds to the d1/d5 system in the presence of non-zero b and the
in section 3, we discuss the n = 4,
liouville potential felt by a probe d1 brane.
u(q1)  u(q5) gauge theory in 2 dimensions when the fayet-iliopoulos (fi) parameters
are non-zero and discuss the transverse uctuations of the brane system (case q5 = 1). we

conclude with a proposal for the sigma model on the moduli space of ncym instantons.

2 d1/d5 system with b-eld

in this section we will construct a solution [5] to type iib supergravity compactied on t 4

which represents the d1/d5 system with a ns b-eld in the internal t 4 directions. we will

obtain this solution from brane systems without a b-eld by a series of t-dualities and use

it to study various properties of this system discussed in the introduction.

we will denote the t 4 directions as x6,7,8,9. we begin with a iib supergravity

solution corresponding to two sets of orthogonal d3-branes extending along x5,6,7 and x5,8,9

respectively. the common direction, x5, is assumed non-compact for the moment. the rst

set of d3-branes, which wraps the t 4 in x6 and x7 directions, is smeared (see, e.g. [22])

over the remaining t 4 directions, x8 and x9. the other set of d3-branes, which wraps x8

and x9 directions, is smeared over x6 and x7. this solution [23] is given by the following

metric, dilaton and self-dual 5-form rr eld strength:

ds2 = (f1f5)1/2(dt2 + (dx5)2) + (f1f5)1/2(dr2 + r2d2

where

k (3) = (df 1
k (3) = (df 1

by

where 1,5 are dimensionless numbers related to the numbers of d3-branes in the two sets.

we have used here a notation which is appropriate to the d1/d5 solution with a b-eld that

we are ultimately interested in. for the sake of completeness, we also give here the type iib

low-energy action to which the above is a solution:

the self-duality constraint, f (5) = f (5), is imposed at the level of the equations of motion.
also, 2 = 8g10, where g10 = 86g24 is the 10-dimensional newtons constant (in the

convention that the dilaton, , vanishes asymptotically).

the desired d1/d5 solution is obtained from the above solution by the following series

of t-duality transformations: a rotation in the x6 - x8 plane by an angle , followed by a

t-duality in the (new) direction x8, followed by a rotation in the x7 - x9 plane by an angle

, which is nally followed by a t-duality in the (new) direction x9. we have used the

t-duality rules for rr eld strength in the form given in [25], adapted to our conventions

(self-dual 5-form rr eld strength). we present below the solution obtained in this way:

here b68 and b79 are arbitrary constants which we have added at the end by a t-duality

transformation that shifts the ns b-eld by a constant. note that for  =  = 0 and

b68 = b79 = 0, the above solution reduces to the well-known solution for d1/d5 system

without b-eld.

2.1 charges

in this subsection we will discuss the various charge densities 2 associated with the rr elds.

the electric charge densities are given by

and the magnetic charge densities by

qelec =

1

22 i f (n),

qmag =

1

22 i f (n).

the integrals above are evaluated at asymptotic distances in the 4-dimensional noncompact

space. note that for arbitrary  and  values, f (3) and f (5) have non-trivial r-dependence

which is dierent from the asymptotic dependence 1/r3. this means, in particular, that the

numerical values of the charges computed in the asymptotically at geometry are dierent

from those computed in the near horizon ads geometry. we shall give below expressions for

charges in both cases. the charges in the near horizon geometry have been distinguished

from those in the asymptotically at geometry by a superscript (h).
2these are densities rather than the total charges, as explained below (2.13).

6

the rr eld strength f (3) gives rise to d1-brane and d5-brane charges while f (5) gives

rise to two types of d3-brane electric and magnetic charges. for our solution these charge

densities are, in an obvious notation,

q1 = (1 cos  cos  + 5 sin  sin ),

q5 = (5 cos  cos  + 1 sin  sin ),

where  = 3/(22) and 3 = 22 is the volume of a unit 3-sphere. here q1 is the

charge density of d1-branes obtained by dividing in addition by the asymptotic volume of
the torus t 4 and q3, q

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

as expected, only the d5-brane charge density is the same in the two cases.

2.2 source branes and mass

we now require that our solution should correspond to only d1- and d5-brane sources. that

is, we want the d3-brane charges to be induced purely by our nonzero b-eld, and not by

any source d3-branes3.

there are two contributions to the d3-brane charge induced by the b-eld. one comes

from the bulk chern-simons term in (2.2),

3note that the full space of supergravity solutions generated by the t-duality group o(4, 4) will have
arbitrary number of source d1-,d3- and d5-branes. we will choose below parameters of our t-duality
transformations in such a way that we have a pure d1/d5 system.

(2.18)

in the chern-simons part of the d5-brane would volume action,

(5)trz xn

e2f +b  c (n).

(2.19)

(2.20)

here (5) is the charge density of a d5-brane and the trace is over the non-abelian gauge
group u(n5), n5 being the number of d5-branes.

the coupling in (2.18) contributes a -function term (with support at the location of the

d5-brane in the 4 noncompact dimensions) in the local d3-brane charge density, proportional

to the value of the b-eld at the horizon. on the other hand, the contribution of (2.19) to the

d3-brane charge is proportional to the dierence of the asymptotic and the horizon values

of b. it can be shown that the sum of these two contributions is an induced d3-brane charge

proportional to the asymptotic value of the b eld, thus leading to (2.22) below.

similarly to the above, there are also contributions to the total d1-brane charge which

are induced by the b-eld. apart from the bulk chern-simons term (2.19), there is also a

contribution from the d5-brane

chern-simons action which is given by

q5z 1

2!

b  b  c (2).

(2.21)

in this case also the two contributions add up to nally give induced d1-brane charge which

depends only on the asymptotic value of b, leading to (2.26) below.

let us now discuss the two cases of the asymptotically at and the near horizon geometry

separately. in other words, we will consider rst the case of the full supergravity solution

(2.4) and then the case in which we take the near-horizon limit in the spirit of [26] and treat

it as an independent solution of iib supergravity in its own right.

(i) asymptotically at geometry

here, the absence of any d3-brane sources is ensured by demanding that

q3 = b()

79 q5, q

3 = b()

68 q5,

(2.22)

8

where

b()

79 = b79, b()

68 = b68,

(2.23)

are the asymptotic values of the two nonzero components of the b-eld. eqns. (2.22) are

satised if we set

b68 =

b79 =

5 sin  cos   1 cos  sin 
5 cos  cos  + 1 sin  sin 
5 cos  sin   1 sin  cos 
5 cos  cos  + 1 sin  sin 

,

.

(2.24)

(2.25)

furthermore, if q1s denotes the d1-brane charge which arises from source d1-branes, then,

using (2.2) and (2.21) it can be shown that

q1s = q1  b()
from (2.10)-(2.13) and (2.22)-(2.26) we then get

68 b()

79 q5.

q1s = 2 15

.

mass

(2.26)

(2.27)

the supergravity solution that we have is 1

4 bps solution [27],
which coincides with its adm mass, is given in terms of the appropriate charge densities by

4 bps. the mass of this 1

m 2 = (q1 + q5)2 + (q3  q

3)2

(2.28)

note that, as expected, the mass given by (2.28) equals the adm mass of

the intersecting d3-brane solution from which the present solution was obtained by t-

duality, i.e.

m = (1 + 5).

(2.29)

we wish to study m as a function of the moduli, keeping q1s and q5 xed. this last

requirement, together with (2.24) and (2.25), determines 1, 5,  and  as functions of the

two moduli b68 and b79:

tan(  ) =

1 =

b68  b79

,

1  b68b79  q1s/q5
q5
2 (cid:26)(1 + b68b79 + q1s/q5) sec(  )

(2.30)

(1  b68b79  q1s/q5) sec( + )(cid:27),

5 =

q5

2 (cid:26)(1 + bb + q1s/q5) sec(  )

+(1  b68b79  q1s/q5) sec( + )(cid:27).

(2.31)

(2.32)

for arbitrary b68 and b79, 1 and 5 given by the above equations will not satisfy any

1 =

2gsn1

quantization conditions, unlike, e.g.,

for b68 = b79 = 0 for which 5 = 2gsn5 and
vt 4/(2)42 , where n1 and n5 are integers. this should not unduly worry us since for
the system under discussion only q1s and q5 have a direct physical interpretation in terms

of brane sources, and it is only on these that appropriate quantization conditions must be

imposed.

we now wish to extremize (2.28) with respect to both b68 and b79. this requires

and then the mass at the xed point is given by

b68 = b79 = qq1s/q5  1,

m 2 = 4q1sq5.

(2.33)

(2.34)

for xed asymptotic volume of t 4, eqns. (2.33) can be seen to x the b-moduli at the

minimum in terms of the ratio of d1- and d5-brane source charges. for a dierent value for

this ratio, the mass is minimized for appropriately dierent values of the b-moduli. stated

dierently, for a xed value of the b-moduli, unless the charge-ratio is given by (2.33), the

system will be unstable and decay to a system which satises (2.33).

hence, once the b-moduli are xed at the values in (2.33), the system forms a true bound

state of the constituent branes 4.

(ii) near horizon geometry

in this case, absence of d3-brane sources is ensured if we set

q(h)

3 = b(h)

79 q5, q(h)

3 = b(h)

68 q5,

(2.35)

4it is interesting to consider the case when the fragmentation happens keeping the ratio of q1s/q5 xed.
eqn. (2.34) would predict zero binding energy and fragmentation at no cost. however, such an eventuality
will be prevented for mutually prime q1s, q5. this is in accord with [28, 4, 29] which indicate singularities
associated with points in the moduli space where q1s and q5 have common factors.

1s = q1s

(2.39)

(2.40)

(2.41)

where q1s is given by (2.27). thus we see that not only do the parameters b68 and b79

have the same values here as in the asymptotically at case, even the source d1-branes are

identical, despite the total d1-brane charges being very dierent in the two cases.

(2.43)

apart from the extra factor of the t 4 volume in the near horizon geometry, this is exactly the

same as (2.34). the extra volume factor correctly takes into account the dierence in the 6-

dimensional newtons constant between the asymptotically at and near horizon geometries

because of the dierence in the t 4 volume in the two cases. we have already seen that the

b-eld is automatically self-dual in the near horizon geometry and that the volume of t 4

satises the condition given by (2.39) and (2.40). we now see that the mass of the bound

state is already at the xed point value. thus the solution we have here provides an explicit

demonstration of the attractor mechanism of [30].

2.3 motion of a separated d1-brane

in this subsection we will discuss the fragmentation of the d1/d5 system in which a single

d1-brane splits o. as mentioned above, the presence of a b-eld leads to a bound state.

therefore, if we consider the motion of the single d1-brane in the background geometry of

the remaining branes, we should nd an attractive potential. this problem was addressed in

[4] who argued that the potential is of the liouville form in the near-horizon geometry. we

will use our supergravity solution to nd the attractive potential in the full geometry which

will include the above result in the near-horizon limit.

let us assume that the remaining d1/d5 system is given by the parameters q1, q5. the

motion of the separated d1-brane can then be described by the following dbi action, coupled

to the supergravity solution (2.4)-(2.9)

where

s1 =

represent the pull-backs of the metric and the b-eld onto the d1-brane world-sheet. we

will consider a radially moving d1-brane, given by

the near-horizon limit is given by the functional form r2 which, in terms of the scalar eld

 = ln r on the throat, is of the liouville form e2.

it is remarkable that the separated d1-brane feels a static potential which is the hall-
mark of a non-bps situation, whereas normally one expects a dp-dq system with p  q
mod 4 = 0 to be bps. it appears even more remarkable if one recalls that the supergravity

solution with the b-eld, which shows the non-zero binding energy, is obtained simply by

a series of t-duality transformations. appearance of non-zero binding energy as a result of

t-duality has been noted before (see, e.g., [24]). see also related remarks in [9].

3 gauge theory description of the d1-d5 bound

state

in this section we discuss the microscopic theory of the d1  d5 system. the moduli space
of instantons of the 5-brane gauge theory with gauge group u(q5) and instanton number
q1 is the resolved symq1q5( t 4). 6. in the limit of small instanton size one can approximate
this description by directly constructing the gauge theory corresponding to the system of q1

d1-branes and q5 d5-branes [6], [7]. this description provides a good physical picture of

the dynamics of the

brane system. the brane conguration is as follows. the d1-branes are wrapped on the
circle s1 along the direction x5 and the d5-branes are wrapped on the 5-torus s1  t 4. the
coordinates of t 4 are denoted by xi, i = 6, 7, 8, 9. the radius r of s1 is chosen so that
r   and v4  2.

the above conguration of branes interact via open strings that are attached to the

branes. denote these by (1, 1), (5, 5), (1, 5) and (5, 1). the low energy dynamics of this

6we have here dropped the subscript s on the source d1-brane charge (which corresponds now to the
instanton number) and, furthermore, by abuse of notation, q5 and q1 are now representing the corresponding
numbers of branes rather than appropriate charge densities as in the previous section.

system is described by a u(q1)  u(q5), n = 4 gauge theory in the 2 dimensions common
to the 2 branes i.e. (t, x5). we also allow for a non-zero  angle corresponding to the relative

u(1) that acts on the hypermultiplets.

the eld content is summarized as follows:

(i) (1, 1) strings :

the elds corresponding to the massless excitations of the (1, 1) strings are obtained

from the dimensional reduction of u(q1), n = 1 sym in 10-dim. the bosonic elds

can be organized as vector and hyper multiplets of n = 2 theory in 4-dim.

0 , a(1)

hyper multiplets

: yi,

i = 6, 7, 8, 9.

in the above description we have neglected the winding modes of the (1, 1) strings on

the torus t 4.

(ii) (5, 5) strings :

the massless modes of the (5, 5) open strings are obtained in a similar way except that

the gauge group is u(q5) and we neglect the kk modes corresponding to the torus
t 4.

(iii) (1, 5) and (5, 1) strings :

the elds corresponding to the massless excitations of the (1, 5) and (5, 1) open strings

can be organized as doublets of the su(2)r symmetry of the gauge theory. su(2)r
is the diagonal subgroup of so(4)i  su(2)  su(2) which acts on the coordinates
xi = 6, 7, 8, 9.

over this eld in the path integral is nite.

in v4 we have included the fayet-iliopoulos (fi) terms  +

with the self dual part of bij, the anti-symmetry tensor of the ns sector of the closed string

summarize.

if we take the trace parts of eqns. (3.8) we get the same set of 3 equations as the d-

the eqns.(3.9) for q1q5 hypermultiplets have been recently discussed in the context of
instantons in non-commutative gauge theory [20, 9]. they dene m = t cp q1q51, the
cotangent bundle of the complex hyper-kahler manifold cp q1q51. the fi parameters  +
ij

can be identied with the moduli of the hyper-kahler metrics on m. for example, in the

case of q1q5 = 2, m is the eguchi-hanson space. when the fi parameters go to zero, it
reduces to the singular space, c 2/z2. similarly, we can show that when the fi terms go to

zero, m dened by the equations (3.12) and (3.13) becomes the singular space (appendix a)

recover the singularity structure corresponding to all the other cycles and the corresponding

chiral primaries, we may have to consider d-terms (similar to equations (3.12) (3.13) with fi

parameters equal to zero ) corresponding to eective u(1) theories describing the splitting

symmetric product description of the instanton moduli space on t 4. [3]

3.3 the bound state in the higgs phase

having discussed the moduli space that characterizes the susy ground state we can discuss

the uctuations of the transverse vector multiplet scalars xm and ym, m = 1, 2, 3, 4. in the
higgs phase since hxmi = hymi = 0 and  =  lies on the surface dened by eqn. (3.9).
the relevant action of uctuations in the path integral is,

s = xm z dtdx5(tru (q5)xmxm + tru (q1)ymym) +z dtdx5(v2 + v3)

(3.11)

we restrict the discussion to the case when q5 = 1 and q1 is arbitrary. in this case the

matrix xm is a real number which we denote by xm.

17

 is a complex column vector with components (aa, ba), a = 1, ..., q1. since we are

looking at the uctuations of the ym only to quadratic order in the path integral, the integrals

over the dierent ym decouple from each other and we can treat each of them separately.

let us discuss the uctuation y1 and set (y1)ab = aby1a. then the potential v3, (3.5)

becomes

v3 = xa

(|aa|2 + |ba|2)(y1a  x1)2

(3.12)

we will prove that |aa|2 + |ba|2 can never vanish if the fi terms are non-zero. in order to
do this let us analyze the complex d-term equation (3.9)

aabb + [n (1)

1 , n (1)

]ab =

(3.13)

we can use the complex gauge group gl(c, q1) to diagonalize the complex matrix n (1)

then, the above equation becomes

[31].

aabb + (na  nb)(n (1)

2

)ab =

c
q1

for a 6= b, this determines the non-diagonal components of n (1)

2

for a = b, we get the equations

(n (1)

aabb
na  nb

which imply that

aaba =

q1

, a = 1, .., q1

|aa||ba| = |c|

q1

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

with the consequence that |aa| and |ba| are non-zero for all a = 1, .., q1. this implies that
(|aa|2 +|ba|2) > 0), and hence the uctuation (y1a  x1) is massive. if we change variables
y1a  y1a + x1, then x1 is the only at direction. this corresponds to the global translation
of the 5-brane in the x1 direction.

a similar analysis can be done for all the remaining directions m = 2, 3, 4 with identical

conclusions. this shows that a non-zero fi term implies a true bound state of the q5 = 1,

q1 = n system. this result was previously presented in [5]. if f i = 0, then there is no

18

such guarantee and the system can easily fragment, due to the presence of at directions in

(ym)ab.

what the above result says is that when the fi parameters are non-zero the zero mode of

the elds (ym)ab is massive. if we regard the zero mode as a collective coordinate then the

hamiltonian of the zero mode has a quadratic potential which agrees with the near horizon

limit of the liouville potential derived in section 2.3.

the general case with an arbitrary number of q1 and q5 branes seems signicantly harder

to prove but we are optimistic.

4 scft on the moduli space of non-commutative

gauge theory

here we briey explore the possible connection of this work with non-commutative geometry.

as has been discussed by several authors, the presence of a non-zero bn s in the near horizon

geometry of a d-brane system wrapped on a torus, will modify the boundary conditions of

the open strings along the brane directions. then, the brane world volume yang-mills theory

is substituted by a yang-mills theory on the non-commutative torus.

in the d1/d5 system, the congurations which break one half of the supersymmetries of

the 5-brane theory are self-dual connections of this ncym theory. the moduli space of these

connections with the bn s turned on, will then dene a conformally invariant sigma-model.

the n = 4 symmetric product scft with c = 6q1q5 has been constructed in some

detail and its 20 dim. moduli space can be explicitly constructed in terms of operators of

the scft [3]. of the four operators corresponding to the blowup modes of the orbifold
singularity, 3 correspond to b(+)
ij

, the self dual part of the bij in the ns sector of the closed

string theory and the remaining one corresponds to the  parameter.

we wish to propose that this new sigma-model, coming from the noncommutative yang-

mills theory, is at some point in the moduli space of the symmetric product scft, deformed
by the addition of the four marginal deformations corresponding to the moduli b+

ij and

ac0 + bc4.

after this work was completed we became aware of [32] which has some overlap with this

work.

a derivation of (3.10)

we now study the limiting case of m = t cp q1q51 as   0. however this seems
presently hard to do and hence we set  = 0 in eqn. (3.9), and explicitly demonstrate that
these equations describe the symmetric product of (q1q5  1) copies of c 2 = c  c where
c denotes the complex plane.

in the following we will, for convenience, use the symbol n for q1q5.

since we are dealing with n u(1) hyper multiplets,

it is convenient to denote the

hypermultiplets by aa, b+

a , a = 1,   , n. then eqns. (3.9) become (we have set  = 0),

the hypermultiplets constitute 2n complex, or equivalently 4n real variables. these
variables are not invariant under the u(1) (a has u(1) charge 1 and b has charge 1).
using (a.1a) and dividing by u(1) leaves us with 4n  2 real, or 2n  1 complex variables
which can be parametrized by the 2(n1)+n = 3n2 (complex) gauge invariant variables

this solution is characterized by a point in (n  1) copies of c 2. however there are
identications which can be characterized in terms of the cycles of the symmetric group

sn . for example consider the action of the largest cycle corresponding to the diagonal
action (a, a)  ei2a/n (a, a)  wa(a, a) where wn = 1.

it is clear that such a transformation leaves the gauge invariant coordinates pa, ma and
