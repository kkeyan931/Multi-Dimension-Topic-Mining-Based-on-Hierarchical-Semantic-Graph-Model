we construct a topological invariant of the renormalization group trajec-
tories of a large class of 2d quantum integrable models, described by the
thermodynamic bethe ansatz approach. a geometrical description of this
invariant in terms of triangulations of three-dimensional manifolds is pro-
posed and associated dilogarithm identities are proven.

introduction

many quantum integrable 2d models can be considered as perturbations of a con-
formal field theory. the rg evolution of these models is described, in the thermo-
dynamic bethe ansatz (tba) approach [1] by the ground state energy e(r) of the
system in a innite cylinder of radius r, through an equation of the form e(r) =
1

a=1r d a() log (1 + ya()), where  is the rapidity, a labels the pseudoener-

2 pn

gies (cf. [2]), ya() are r-dependent functions, determined by a set of coupled integral
equations known as tba equations; the as are elementary functions of r and , related
to the asymptotic behaviour of the ya()s for   .

an important observation of al.b.zamolodchikov[3] was that any solution {ya()}
of the tba equations satises a set of simple functional equations, called the y-system.
conversely, it can be shown that under appropriate analytic and asymptotic restric-
tions the y-system is equivalent to the set tba equations. for instance, the y-system
describing the ow from the tricritical ising model to the critical ising one is given by

y1( +

i
2

)y1( 

i
2

) = 1 + y2() , y2( +

i
2

)y2( 

i
2

) = 1 + y1() .

(1.1)

this system, like any other y-system, can be considered as a recursion relation in the
imaginary rapidity. to simplify the notations we can put n(r, ) = y 3
2 ),
then the eq. (1.1) becomes

2 + (1)n

( + n i

2

n1n+1 = 1 + n .

(1.2)

it is immediate to verify that this y-system is periodic: n+5 = n, i.e. y1( + 5
2 i) =
y2() , y2(+ 5
2 i) = y1() . in ref. [3] it was also conjectured that a similar periodicity
ya( + p i) = ya() where the period p is related to the dimension of the perturbing
operator by  = 1  1/p .

in the uv limit r  0 the vacuum energy e(r) is expected to behave as e(r) 

ec/6r, where ec is the eective central charge of th uv xed point. in general one

where l(x) is the rogers dilogarithm. it can be dened as the unique function three
times dierentiable which satises the following ve term relationship, known also as
the abel functional equation (see for instance [4])

l(x) + l(y) + l(cid:18) 1  x

1  xy(cid:19) + l(1  xy) + l(cid:18) 1  y

1  xy(cid:19) = 3 l(1) ,

(1.4)

with 0  x, y  1 and the normalization l(1) = 2
[15, 7] which becomes manifest rewriting it in the form [7]

6 . this equation has a zz5 symmetry

l(cid:18) n

1 + n(cid:19) = 3 l(1) ,

5xn=1

(1.5)

where the ns full the recursion relation (1.2). clearly eq. (1.5) denes an invariant of
the rg ow of the tricritical ising system, being the l arguments non-trivial functions
of r and , while the r.h.s. is constant along the rg trajectory. this behaviour suggests
[7] the existence of large families of functional equations, which are generalizations of
(1.5). the simplest examples are classied in terms of an ordered pair g  h of adet
(tn = a2n/zz2) dynkin diagrams [5]

(1.6)

here gac and hbd are the adjacency matrices of the appropriate dynkin diagrams
whereas rg and rh are the ranks of the corresponding algebras. the solutions to this
system are conjectured to be periodic functions: b

a(n + p ) = b

a and b the conjugate nodes to a and b, while h and g are the dual coxeter numbers.
then, the s solving eq. (1.6) are, according to our conjecture, arguments of functional
equations for the rogers dilogarithm, l(x), of the following form

a(n)(cid:19) = rgrhgl(1) .

(1.7)

notice that since l(x) is a multi-valued function, the r.h.s of eq. (1.7) cannot be xed
unambiguously, unless a consistent choice of the sheet of the associated riemann surface
is implemented. the quoted value corresponds to solutions of the recursion relations
with all the s > 0.
it is interesting that the an  a1 (n = 1, 2, 3) identities re-
duce respectively to the euler, abel and newman functional equations (cf. [8] ) when
symmetric conditions on the conjugated nodes are chosen.

other examples of y-systems with their corresponding dilogarithm identities were
found and discussed in ref. [9]. furthermore, two new families of y-systems and dilog-
arithm functional equations, classied in terms of a pair of co-prime integer (p, q) asso-
ciated to the sine-gordon model at rational points and to its reductions, were proposed
and partially studied [9, 10] (see [12] for even more exotic relations).

very soon after their discovery, the general solution of the an  a1 systems was
found and the corresponding dilogarithm identities independently proven in [10, 13].
we report here the solution proposed in ref. [10], which was related to the fact, already
known to lobachevskij, that dilogarithms dene volumes of particular tetrahedra in
hyperbolic space and other manifolds.

the seed of the idea was introduced in 1992 in the eld of integrable models by
[14], where a manifold

ref. [6]. other ideas were then expound and elaborated in ref.
on which rogers dilogarithms dene volumes of ideal tetrahedra was identied.

2 the geometrical picture

the starting point of ref.
[10] was the assumption that the abel equation mimics in
some way a volume calculation of a compact manifold. although the existence and the
nature of such a manifold could not be further argued, this geometrical point of view
was rather powerful and allowed to prove in a rigorous way, just using eq. (1.4) as the
only ingredient, the an  a1 identities and to solve the y system of a general class
of thermally perturbed minimal models. let us mention that after the main results of
ref.s [7, 10, 13] were already appeared, we became aware  of an undated manuscript by
d.zagier where this geometric approach is claried and simplied.

 we are grateful to the referee of an earlier version of [10] for a copy of zagiers notes.

we can now rephrase our construction as follows. consider an arbitrary triangula-
tion of an arbitrary three-dimensional manifold, made by m oriented tetrahedra {ti}.
the fact that this set forms a triangulation means that the boundary of the associated
3-chain is zero:

 (

ti) = 0 ,

(2.8)

mxi=1

where the boundary of the tetrahedron t  [abcd] is dened in the standard way:

 [abcd] = [abc]  [bcd] + [cda]  [dab]

.

(2.9)

now associate to each vertex i (i = 1, . . . n ) a real number  xi. through this map we
can assign to each tetrahedron t , the cross-ratio t = (abcd) of the values associated to
its vertices

t  [abcd]  t = (abcd) ,

(abcd) =

.

(2.10)

(a  c)(b  d)
(a  d)(b  c)

in the following we shall use some elementary properties of the cross-ratios:

(abcd) = (cdab) = (badc) = 1  (acbd) = (bacd)1
(aabc) = 1 ,

(abbc) =  ,

(abcb) = 0 .

we shall prove that

mxj=1

l(tj) = n l(1) ,

(2.11)

(2.12)

where the integer n is unambiguously xed when the sequence of real numbers {xi} is
ordered in such a way that all the tjs belong to the interval [0, 1]. since the number
m of tetrahedra is less or equal to the number n of vertices, there are simple algebraic
relations among the tjs. for suitable triangulations they coincide with the y-system of
known integrable models. before giving a general proof of eq. (2.12) let us see a couple
of simple instances.

consider a polytope made of tetrahedra in four dimensional euclidean space. well
known examples of this kind are the three regular polytopes 5-cell (or 4-simplex) , 16-
cell (dual to hypercube) and 600-cell. they are all triangulations of s3 (see for example
[11]). the 5-cell of g. 1a is formed by the following ve tetrahedra

t1 = [bacd], t2 = [cbde], t3 = [dcea], t4 = [edab], t5 = [aebc]

.

more generally, the xis may be chosen as points of an arbitrary circle of the complex plane in order

to have real cross-ratios in eq. (2.10).

1b) dual polytope.

the pentagonal relation (1.4) is then secured assigning ve real numbers {a < b <

c < d < e} to the vertex set {a, b, c, d, e}; one immediately end-up with 

l((bacd)) + l((cbde)) + l((dcea)) + l((edab)) + l((aebc)) = 3l(1) .

(2.13)

it is instructive to draw the adjacency graph of this set of tetrahedra; associating each
tetrahedron to a vertex an connecting with a line two tetrahedra sharing the same face,
we end up with the graph of the dual polytope, which in this case is again a 5-cell (see
g. 1b). for each loop of the adjacency graph one can write an algebraic relation among
the cross-ratios of the tetrahedra touched by the loop. in particular, it is easy to verify
that the l arguments full the recursion relation (1.2).

moreover the well known identity l(x) + l(1  x) = l(1), known as euler equation,

can be written as

hence

l((abcd)) + l((acbd)) = l(1) ,

(2.14)

l((bcad)) + l((cdbe)) + l((deca)) + l((eadb)) + l((abec)) = 2 l(1) .

(2.15)

in the following we shall use the short-hand notation l{abcde} = 3l(1) for the identity

(2.13) and el{abcde} = 2l(1) for the identity (2.15).

as a more engaging example, let us consider the 16-cell. this polytope has 8 vertices,
characterized by the property that each vertex is linked to all the others but one (see g.

because of the projective invariance of the cross-ratio, three of these values can be xed arbitrarily,

then these ve cross-ratios depend actually only on two free parameters, as required by eq. (1.4).

2a). ordering the vertices in such a way that the unlinked ones are given by the pair
i, i+4 mod 8, the 16 tetrahedra split in two sets, associated to the following cross-ratios:

tj = (xjxj1xj+1xj+2) , uj = (xjxj1xj+2xj3),

(j = 1, 2 . . . 8)

(2.16)

where all the indices are taken modulo 8 and x1 < x2 < . . . x8. starting from the sum
of the following ve-term relations written as

22 l(1) = l{x1x2x3x4x5} + el{x1x3x4x5x6} + el{x1x2x4x5x7} + el{x1x2x3x5x0}
+ l{x5x6x7x0x1} + el{x5x7x0x1x2} + el{x5x6x0x1x3} + el{x5x6x7x1x4}

one can easily verify that each ve-term relation contains two tetrahedra of the trian-
gulation (2.16); the remaining 24 tetrahedra combine in pairs according to eq. (2.14),
so one is directly led to the sought-after 16-term relation

8xi=1

[l(ti) + l(ui)] = 10 l(1) .

(2.17)

drawing the adjacency graph of these tetrahedra we nd the dual polytope, i.e. the
8-cell (or hypercube) represented in g. 2b.

there is an algebraic relation for any set of tetrahedra connected by a closed path of
such a graph. in order to nd a link with known y-systems it is convenient to transform

the argument t = (abcd) of l, using the the relation et = (adcb) = t/(1  t). dene

6

now y1(n) = et3n+3 and y2(n) = eu3n, where all the indices are understood modulo 8.

one can check that the following relations are fullled

y1(n  1)y1(n + 2) = (1 + y2(n))(1 + y2(n + 1))
y2(n  1)y2(n + 1) = (1 + y1(n))/(1 + 1/y2(n)) .

(2.18)

this is the y-system corresponding to the 13-thermal perturbation of the m5,8 minimal
model.

while the discovery of the y-system associated to the 600-cell is still an open chal-
lenge, two innite families of s3 triangulations associated to known integrable models
may be found in ref. [10].

dilogarithm functions obey a general property known as beta-map [13, 14, 15],
that we will shortly introduce. the beta-map and various geometrical notions relating
dilogarithms to three-dimensional compact manifolds will merge together giving a more
unied point of view. swapping between these two main tools we will then be able to
prove many of the ade-related dilogarithm identities.

the beta-map condition adapted to the rogers dilogarithm states that a sucient

condition for having the dilogarithm functional equations

xi

l(ki)  zzl(1) ,

is that the following condition is satised

xi

ki  (1  ki) = 0 ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

where the wedge product is dened through the properties

x  z = z  x , (xy)  z = x  z + y  z .

(2.21)

for a more detailed discussion of the relation (2.19-2.20) the reader is referred to [13,
14, 15].

if the l argument is expressed as a cross-ratio t, we have t  (1  t) = (abcd)  (acbd)

and

(abcd)  (acbd) = (abc)  (bcd) + (cda)  (dab) ,

(2.22)

where we have dened

(abc) = (a  c)  (a  b) + (a  c)  (c  b) + (b  c)  (a  b) .

comparison between eq. (2.9) and eq. (2.22) shows that the beta map acts on the cross-
ratios associated to the tetrahedra like the boundary operator , hence we have the
implication

tj  (1  tj) = 0 ,

(2.23)

 (xj

tj) = 0  xj

7

which proves eq. (2.12).

it is important to note that the implication (2.23) cannot be inverted. actually
we found y-systems which do not correspond strictly to a triangulation. the simplest
example is the solution of the dn  dn  a1 systems of eq. (1.6):

a(n + 1)a(n  1) =

nyb=1

(1 + b(n))d

(n)
ab

.

(2.24)

these systems emerge from the tba analysis of the sine-gordon model at the reection-
less points  = 1/(n  1) [3] in the attractive regime, or equivalently (with the change
  1/) at the points  = (n  1) [16] in the repulsive regime. the solution will
be written in terms of cross-ratios of a unique function j  hj (j = 1, . . . n ) exactly
as in the models treated previously, but now h is quasi-periodic, in the sense that
hjn = qhj + p, where p and q are real numbers. for the an 2 tail of the diagram (see
g. 3a) we have

a(n) = (hjhihi+1hj+1) ,

i = [ na2

2

]

,

j = [ n+a

2 ] ,

a  n  2 ,

(2.25)

with the square brackets indicating that the indices must be taken modulo n . for the
two nodes n  1 and n (the fork of the diagram) we can write

n (n  1) = z(n  1)

, n 1(n  1) = z(n  1) ,

(2.26)

].

with z+(n) = (hjhihi+1), z(n) = (hi+1hj+1hj), where i = [ nn 1
[ n+n 1

2
it is now easy to verify the conjectured periodicity a(n + 2n ) = a(n).
introducing, besides the n points associated to hj, n further vertices j = 1, . . . n
associated to the values j  qhj + p and a vertex associated to , it is possible to
represent this y-system with a 3-chain dn of n 2 tetrahedra and 2n + 1 vertices. now
the boundary of this chain does not vanish, however we have {dn + bn } = 0 , where
bn is the auxiliary 3-chain

] and j =

2

bn =

n 2xj=1 (cid:8)[j, n, j + 1, ] + [j, j + 1, n , ](cid:9) .

(2.27)

we can then write a dilog identity associated to the triangulation dn + bn (which
turns out to be again a triangulation of s3). since we have

(hj hn hj+1) + (hjhj+1hn ) = 1 ,

the tetrahedra of bn can be paired o using the euler identity l(x) + l(1  x) = l(1),
so we end up with the result conjectured in eq. (1.7). note that because of the pairing

just mentioned, the chain bn gives a vanishing contribution to the beta map (2.20),
hence also the chain dn , although it is not a triangulation, fullls this condition. as
an explicit example, the adjacency graph of the d4 system is drawn in g. 3b; the grey
circles denote the tetrahedra of the b4 chain and the dotted lines correspond to their
faces. other innite families of such quasi-triangulations can be found in ref. [17].

3 general ade  ade identities

in this section we will generalize the proof of the functional dilogarithm identities to
more general cases, where the existence of an associated triangulation is not known,
using the only assumption that the associated y system is periodic.

lets introduce an auxiliary set of equations again classied in terms of a pair of

dynkin diagrams (g, h)

t b
a (n + 1)t b

a (n  1) =

rhyd=1

t d
a (n)hbd +

rgyc=1

t b
c (n)gac

.

(3.28)

when specialized to an  ade the three term relations (3.28) coincide with the well
known (cf. [18]) fusion-relations appearing in integrable lattice models. they are often
called t systems. analytically for the lower rank cases and numerically more generally

9

one can again show that they full the cyclic property

t b
a (n + p ) = t b

a (n) , p = h + g .

furthermore dening

y g
a (n) =

rgyc=1

t b
c (n)gac

1 + y b

a (n) = t b

a (n + 1)t b

a (n  1)

rhyd=1

a (n)hba ,
t d

(3.31)

one can easily show that the functions y dened in (3.30) satisfy eq.s (1.6). now
writing the y s in terms of the t s using (3.30) and the periodicity (3.29) one can show
that (2.20) is vanishing. we have

for m and k arbitrary symmetric matrices we conclude that eq. (3.32) vanishes and
therefore we have dilogarithm identities.

4 conclusions

we have described a general method to write functional dilogarithm identities associated
to the tba formulation of the renormalization group evolution of integrable quantum
models. it is worth to observe that such identities dene quantities of topological nature,

10

because they do not vary under arbitrary deformations of the vertex function j  xj,
provided that the initial ordering of the set {xj} is preserved.

our geometrical description of these identities in terms of triangulations (or quasi-
triangulations) of three-dimensional manifolds provides us with the general solution of
the recursion relations associated to the y systems and hence a simple explanation of
their periodicity. another consequence of this approach is to show that the y s can
be expressed in terms of a unique periodic (or quasi-periodic) function x(), related
to xj through xj = x( + i j
in particular, it is
easy to nd the x() corresponding to the stationary (i.e. - independent) version of of
the y systems and their associated dilog identities. for instance one can verify, using
eq.s (2.25,2.26) that the stationary solution of the an system is given by x() = e2 n+1
and that of the dn system is h() = .

g ), where g depends on the model.

n+3

from a physical point of view, these functional identities dene a quantity which
is conserved during the renormalization group evolution of the system. in particular
in the uv limit the system is described by a conformal eld theory, then the r.h.s. of
such identities must be expressible only in terms of conformal quantities such as the
eective central charge and the conformal dimension  of the perturbing operators. for
instance, in the purely elastic ade related models the integer n of eq. (2.12) is given
by the ratio cef f
 .

the rg ow of any quantum eld theory can be viewed as a typical dissipative
process, because the integration of degrees of freedom responsible of the trajectory be-
tween the uv and the ir xed points yields an information loss of the system. then
it is amazing that there are conserved quantities along these trajectories. it would be
very interesting, also in connection with the c theorem of a.b.zamolodchikov, to nd a
eld-theoretic description of such an invariant.
