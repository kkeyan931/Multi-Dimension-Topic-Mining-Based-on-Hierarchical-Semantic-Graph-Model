abstract

n = 1 d = 4 supermembrane (in a at background) and super d2-brane dual to it are
described within the nonlinear realizations approach as theories of the partial supersym-
metry breaking n = 1 d = 4  n = 1 d = 3. we construct the relevant invariant
o-shell goldstone supereld actions and demonstrate them to be dual to each other.
their bosonic cores are, respectively, the static-gauge nambu-goto and d = 3 born-infeld
actions. the supermembrane supereld equation of motion admits a transparent geomet-
ric interpretation suggesting an extension of the standard superembedding constraints.
we briey discuss the 1/4 breaking of n = 1 d = 5 supersymmetry along similar lines.

introduction. the partial breaking of global supersymmetry (pbgs) (see, e.g.

[1] -
1.
[9]) is a characteristic feature of supersymmetric extended objects. a general framework for
describing pbgs is provided by the nonlinear realizations (coset) approach [10]-[12]. its basic
objects are goldstone superelds which live on a superspace of unbroken susy and comprise a
minimal worldvolume supermultiplet of given superbrane (a scalar one in the case of p-branes,
a vector one in the case of d-branes, etc). the rest of full brane susy is realized as nonlinear
transformations of goldstone superelds. all the known pbgs examples correspond to a
static-gauge form of some bps superbranes, with all their local symmetries xed.

one of the merits of the pbgs approach is the opportunity to construct manifestly world-
volume supersymmetric o-shell supereld actions for superbranes. not too many explicit
examples of such actions are known, and their precise relation to the green-schwarz-type ac-
tions was not fully inquired. it also remains to clear up how the pbgs approach is related to
the superembedding one [13]-[16]. note that only the 1/2 susy breaking was treated so far.
with all this in mind, it seems important to analyze more examples of pbgs and to extend
its framework to the cases of 1/4, 1/8 . . . breaking.

in this letter we describe the n = 1 d = 4 supermembrane in the coset approach.

it
corresponds to the breaking n = 1 d = 4  n = 1 d = 3. we show that the basic geometro-
dynamical constraint of the superembedding formalism [13, 15, 16] is manifested as a covariant
condition on some cartan 1-form, such that it expresses the goldstone fermionic supereld
through the basic scalar one, still leaving the theory o shell [16]. on the other hand, the
equation of motion can also be given a nice geometric interpretation as vanishing of covariant
spinor projection of yet another cartan form. we present supereld o-shell pbgs actions both
for the supermembrane and a dual super d2-brane, thus solving the long-standing problem of
setting up such actions [3, 17]. the d2-brane action provides a n = 2 superextension of the
d = 3 born-infeld one. we also briey discuss the 1/4 breaking of n = 1 d = 5 susy.

2. n = 1 d = 4 poincare superalgebra. from the d = 3 standpoint the n = 1 d = 4
susy algebra is a central-charge extended n = 2 poincare superalgebra

n = 1 d = 4 susy  n = 2 d = 3 susy

 {qa, pab, sa, z} ,

(1)

a, b = 1, 2 being the d = 3 sl(2, r) spinor indices 1. the basic anticommutation relations read

{qa, qb} = pab ,

{qa, sb} = abz ,

{sa, sb} = pab .

(2)

the d = 3 translation generator pab = pba together with the central charge generator z form
the d = 4 translation generator.

to the set (1) one should add the generators of the d = 4 lorentz group so(1, 3) consisting

of the so(1, 2) generators mab = mba and the so(1, 3)/so(1, 2) coset ones kab = kba

[mab, mcd] = acmbd + admbc + bcmad + bdmac ,
[mab, kcd] = ackbd + adkbc + bckad + bdkac ,
[kab, kcd] = acmbd  admbc  bcmad  bdmac .

(3)

the commutation relations between the so(1, 3) generators and those from the set (1) read

[mab, pcd] = acpbd + adpbc + bcpad + bdpac , [mab, qc] = acqb + bcqa ,

1the indices are raised and lowered as follows: v a = abvb, vb = bcv c,

abbc = c

a .

[mab, sc] = acsb + bcsa , [pab, kcd] = 2(acbd + bcad)z ,
[z, kab] = 2pab , [kab, qc] = acsb + bcsa , [kab, sc] = acqb  bcqa .

3. coset space, transformations and cartan forms. to construct a nonlinear realiza-
tion of n = 1 d = 4 susy (including the group so(1, 3)), such that n = 1 d = 3 susy
remains unbroken, we choose the vacuum stability subgroup to be h  {qa, pab, mab}. we
put the generators qa, pab into the coset and associate with them the n = 1 d = 3 su-
perspace coordinates na, xabo. the remaining coset parameters are goldstone superelds,
a  a(x, ), q  q(x, ), ab  ab(x, ). a coset element g is dened by

g = exabpabeaqaeqzeasaeabkab .

(5)

acting on (5) from the left by dierent elements of the n = 1 d = 4 poincare supergroup,

one can nd the transformation properties of the coset coordinates.

these derivatives appear as the coecients in the decompositions of 1-superforms over the
dierentials dxab, da and correspond to a truncated version of nonlinear realization of n =
1 d = 4 susy, with only the so(1, 2) subgroup of so(1, 3) being kept (this version amounts
to putting ab = 0 in the above relations). the genuine covariant derivatives are the coecients
in the decompositions over the full covariant dierentials ab

q dened in (11).

4. kinematical and dynamical constraints. not all of the above goldstone superelds

nq(x, ), a(x, ), ab(x, )o are to be treated as independent. indeed, ab and a appear inside

the form z linearly and so can be covariantly eliminated by the manifestly covariant constraint

z = 0

(inverse higgs eect [18]). eq. (18) amounts to the following set of equations

(a) dabq +

4

1 + 22 ab = 0 ,

(b) daq  a = 0 .

(18)

(19)

eqs. (19) are purely algebraic nonlinear relations serving to express  and  through x and
-derivatives of q (the expression for  can be obtained by successive iterations of eq. (19b)).
thus the supereld q(x, ) is the only essential goldstone supereld needed to present the
partial spontaneous breaking n = 1 d = 4  n = 1 d = 3 within the coset scheme.
the d part of the constraint (18), i.e. eq. (19b), is recognized as the static-gauge form
of the geometro-dynamical constraint [13, 15, 16] of the superembedding approach (for the
at target n = 1 d = 4 superspace). note that (19b) is covariant on its own right under all
spontaneously broken symmetries including the coset part of the d = 4 lorentz symmetry. in
agreement with the linearized analysis of ref. [16], eq. (18) does not imply any dynamics and
leaves q(x, ) o shell (as distinct, e.g., from the case treated in [9]).

3

now we want to put the additional constraint on the cartan forms in order to get mani-
festly covariant dynamical equations. the condition we propose has no direct analogs in the
superembedding formalism. we postulate the following constraint

s| = 0  dab + 2ab = 0  (a) daa = 0 ,

(b) d(ab) = 2ab .

(20)

where | means the ordinary d- projection of the form s. to see that it is covariant with
cddxcd
respect to all broken symmetries, it is enough to notice that, in virtue of (18), ab
with detaab
cd 6= 0. then the covariant spinor projection of s (i.e., the coecient of a
q)
coincides, modulo a rotation of the spinor index a by some non-degenerate matrix, with the
d- projection written down in (20).

p  aab

note that eq. (20a) is the consistency condition among eq. (20b) and the kinematical eqs.

(19). indeed, inserting (19) into (20b) and using the algebra (17), one can derive

(daa)2 = 0 .

(21)

it is important to realize that it the presence of the lorentz goldstone superelds ab(x, ) in the
coset superspace which allows us to consistently write the dynamical equation in the geometrical
form (20). putting, e.g., ab = 0 in (20) would yield dab = 0 that is too restrictive.

the nal form of the dynamical equation is obtained by substituting (19b) into (20a)

it is recognized as a covariantization of the free equation of motion dadaq  d2 q = 0. a more
detailed convenient form of (20a) or (22) is as follows

dadaq = 0 .

(22)

2 d(ab)adf df b = 0 .

(23)

to see, which kind of dynamics is hidden in (22), we considered it in the bosonic limit. we

found that it amounts to the following equation for q(x)  q(x, )|=0

which corresponds to the static gauge form of the d = 4 membrane nambu-goto action

thus eq. (22) (or (20)) can be naturally interpreted as a manifestly n = 1 d = 3 worldvolume
supersymmetric pbgs form of the equations of the supermembrane in d = 4. in the next
section we show that eq. (22) can be deduced from an o-shell action.

5. supereld action of n = 1 d = 4 supermembrane. the standard methods of nonlinear
realizations fail to construct the supereld action for the supermembrane. the full spinor and
bosonic covariant derivatives of the supereld q(x, ), viz. aq, abq, are equal to zero in
virtue of our constraint (18). therefore, the natural candidate for the manifestly invariant
action, r d3xd2 sdete (aqaq), identically vanishes.

(25)

to nd the action, we will follow the method of ref. [6]. let us start with a bosonic scalar

supereld (x, ) and dene the fermionic supereld a(x, )

a = da ,

d2a = abb

(d2  dada) .

(26)

let us now try to nd a linear realization of an extra n = 1 d = 3 susy on the spinor a and
some, arbitrary for the moment, scalar supereld (x, ). assuming the second susy to be
spontaneously broken, the most general linear transformation law of a can be written as

a = a + ad2a + abb ,

(27)

where a is a parameter of the second susy and a is a constant. requiring the standard
closure of the second n = 1 susy together with preservation of the constraint in (26) xes
a = 1 and implies the following transformation law for the bosonic supereld 

 =

1
2

aa =

2

ada .

before going further, let us make two comments.
first, the eld  is a good candidate for the lagrangian density. indeed, the action

s = z d3xd2 

is invariant as the integrand is shifted by a spinor derivative under the variation (28).

secondly, one can extract from (27) the transformation law of the scalar supereld :

 = aa  2daa .

(28)

(29)

(30)

the bracket of the manifest and second n = 1 susys on the supereld  yields a constant
shift of , in agreement with the structure relations (2). so in the present case we face the
same n = 1 d = 4 susy  n = 2 d = 3 susy as before (the linear multiplet we have
constructed is a d = 3 reduction of chiral n = 1 d = 4 multiplet).
to establish a contact with the previous consideration, let us rst show that the supereld

 can be covariantly expressed in terms of a.

close inspection of the transformation law (27) shows that the leading part of this supereld
can be represented by 1/4aa  1/42. then one nds the following recursion equation for :

 =

1
4

2

1 + d2

.

(31)

to solve it, let us note that the nominator of (31) already contains the maximal power of the
spinors a. thus the term d2 in the denominator eectively does not contain free spinors a,
it can contain only terms dab. as a result, we can write the following equation for (d2)ef f :

(d2)ef f =

1
4

d22

1 + (d2)ef f

.

(32)

solving eq. (32) and specializing to the solution which goes to zero in the limit   0, we nd

(d2)ef f =

1 + 1 + d22

finally, the action (29) takes the following form

s = z d3xd2  

1

2 z d3xd2

2

1 + 1 + d22 ,

a = da  .

(34)

for the physical bosonic component |=0 one obtains just the nambu-goto action (25).
can check that under the transformations (27), (28) the object

now we are ready to reveal the relation with the previously used superelds a and q. one

transforms according to the law

a =

a = a +

(35)

(36)

this is just the active form of the transformations (7), so a in (35) can be identied with
the nonlinear realizations goldstone fermionic supereld. after a straightforward, though cum-
bersome computation with making use of the equivalence relation (35), the equation of motion
corresponding to (34) can be written in terms of a as

[1  1

(37)

although, at rst sight, (37) radically diers from the previously conjectured eq. (23), we have
checked that the former implies the latter and vise versa! the proof [19] is based, rst, on the
fact that eq. (37) encodes eq. (23) together with some corollaries thereof and, second, that a
satises a nonlinear version of the kinematical irreducibility constraint (26) (it can be deduced
using either eq.(35) or (19b)). thus, eq.(23) conjectured on the purely geometric grounds
amounts to eq. (37) obtained from the o-shell action (34). this one-to-one correspondence
conrms the self-consistency of our approach and the relevancy of the extension (20) of the
standard superembedding postulate. it also implies that (34) possesses all the symmetries of
eq. (23), including so(1, 3) symmetry. note that one can nd the equivalence relation directly
between the unconstrained scalar superelds (x, ) and q(x, ) and rewrite (34) via q(x, ).
when all fermions are discarded, the relation abq = ab follows. it means that the physical
bosonic elds in eqs. (25), (24) and in the action (34) coincide up to nilpotent additions.

6. d2-brane. like in other pbgs theories, in our case the goldstone fermion can be placed
into dierent multiplets of unbroken n = 1 d = 3 susy. besides a scalar multiplet, we can
choose a vector multiplet as the basic goldstone one.
in a eld-strength formulation it is
represented by n = 1 spinor supereld a subjected to the constraint [20]:

daa = 0  ( d2a = abb

abdab = 0 .

(38)

it leaves in a the rst fermionic (goldstone) component together with the divergenceless
vector fab  dab|=0 (just the gauge eld strength). due to the vector-scalar d = 3 duality,
the supereld a is expected to describe a d2-brane which is dual to the supermembrane.

6

in constructing the relevant goldstone supereld action we again follow ref. [6]. we start
by dening a linear realization of the second (broken) susy on the supereld a and some
scalar supereld . the unique possibility consistent with the constraint (38) is 2.

a = a  d2a + abb ,

 =

like in the supermembrane case, one can write the recursion equation

 =

1  d2

and solve it to get

 =

1
2

2

1 + 1  d22 .

due to the transformation law of  (39) and the basic constraint (38), the action

s = z d3xd2  = 

1

2 z d3xd2

2

1 + 1  d22

is invariant under the second susy (39). its bosonic core is the d = 3 born-infeld action

where

s = z d3x(cid:16)1 + 2f 2  1(cid:17) ,

abfab = 0  fab = acgc

b + bcgc

a .

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

to nd how the action (42) is related to the supermembrane one (34) we make the duality

transformation. we add the constraint (38) to (42) with a supereld lagrange multiplier:

s  

1

2 z d3xd2 

2

1 + 1  d22

+ daa! .

varying (45) with respect to the unconstrained supereld a, we nd

a  da =

2 a

1 + 1  d22

+ ad2


2

(cid:16)1 + 1  d22(cid:17)2 1  d22

.




we then substitute (46) back into (45)

s =

1

2 z d3xd2

2

(cid:16)1 + 1  d22(cid:17)1  d22

=

2this is a d = 3 reduction of n = 1 d = 4 linear (or tensor) multiplet [20].

.

(48)

7

the last step is to express x in terms of a. we need to know only the eective form of x
because the nominator (47) already contains the maximal power of . so, from (46) one gets

d22

(cid:16)1 + 1  d22)(cid:17)1  d22

(49)

where  means that the equation is valid up to spinors with no derivatives. it is easy to nd

and hence

(cid:16)1 + 1  d22)(cid:17)1  d22
d22  (4x  2)x .

4

= 4x  2

(51)

solving eq. (51) for x, we nally nd (47) to be just the supermembrane action (34).

thus we have demonstrated that the action (42) is dual to the supermembrane action,
possesses partially broken n = 2 susy and is reduced to the born-infeld action in the bosonic
limit. so, we may conclude that (42) is a gauge-xed super d2-brane action or, equivalently,
n = 1 superextension of the d = 3 born-infeld action with a hidden nonlinearly realized
second susy. we did not study how to reproduce this n = 2  n = 1 pbgs pattern
directly from the nonlinear realizations. the duality of the action (42) to the supermembrane
one is an indication that the former possesses all symmetries of the latter. this suggests that
in the present case one should start from a nonlinear realization of the same n = 1 d = 4
supergroup, but place the generator z into the vacuum stability subgroup in order to avoid the
presence of scalar goldstone supereld in the coset.

7. n = 4  n = 1 breaking. finally, we briey discuss the 1/4 partial breaking n = 1 d =
5 (n = 4 d = 3)  n = 1 d = 3 along the lines of previous sections.
from the d = 3 point of view, extending n = 1 d = 4 susy to n = 1 d = 5 amounts
to adding one more translation generator p5, two real supertranslation generators qa, sa and
two extra lorentz generators lab and u which complement so(1, 3) to so(1, 4). we as before
wish n = 1 d = 3 susy to be unbroken, so we are led to add new goldstone superelds
p5  q(x, ) , qa  a(x, ) , sa  a(x, ) , lab  uab(x, ) , u  u(x, ) . (52)
the linearized analysis shows that a(x, ), uab(x, ) and u(x, ) can be covariantly expressed
in terms of q(x, ) and a(x, ). thus, the set of unremovable goldstone superelds enlarges to
{q, q, a}. the supereld a is reducible, and we impose a proper constraint on it (cf. eq. (38)):
(53)

daa = 0 .

n = 4 d = 3 susy should be nonlinearly realized on this minimal set of goldstone superelds.
by analogy with the supermembrane and d2-brane, we can try to extend this set by an
additional scalar bosonic supereld  to achieve a linear realization of n = 4 susy on the
enlarged set. curiously, such an extension exists and the resulting transformations mimic those
for the membrane (27)-(30) and d2-brane (39).

here, a, a and a are the corresponding parameters. this representation is seemingly a d = 3
form of the d = 5 version of n = 2 d = 4 linear (tensor) multiplet [21].

as in the previously considered cases, the simplest action

(55)

(56)

(57)

s = z d3xd2 

is invariant under n = 4 d = 3 susy, and our task is to express the supereld  in terms of

in this paper we have constructed, for the rst time, o-shell
8. concluding remarks.
manifestly d = 3 supervolume supersymmetric pbgs actions for n = 1 d = 4 supermembrane
and for its dual super d2-brane (in a at background). the former action is expected to provide
an o-shell supereld form of the component on-shell action found in [3] by xing the static
gauge in the d = 4 supermembrane green-schwarz action. the d2-brane action is an n = 2
superextension of the d = 3 born-infeld action with a nonlinearly realized second susy. the
supermembrane supereld equation of motion was shown to have a geometric interpretation of
vanishing of the odd supervolume projection of the covariant dierential of goldstone fermionic
supereld. this implies an extension of the standard geometro-dynamical postulate of the
superembedding approach. actually, it matches with the double-analyticity principle put
forward in early works on this approach [14], being its extreme dynamical form. it would be
of interest to nd further examples to which such an extension is relevant. also, it would be
tempting to establish a relation with the d = 4 supermembrane worldvolume action proposed
in [17] within the superembedding formalism. one more (perhaps, most intriguing) problem
for the future study is to further elaborate on the description of the 1/4, 1/8, ... pbgs in the
framework of nonlinear realizations, with the toy model of sect.7 as a starting point.
