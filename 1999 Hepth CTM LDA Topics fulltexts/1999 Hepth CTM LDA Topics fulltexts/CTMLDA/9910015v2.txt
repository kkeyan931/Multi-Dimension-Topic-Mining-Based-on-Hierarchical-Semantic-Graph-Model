abstract

we determine the instanton corrections to the eective coupling in su (2),
n = 2 yang-mills theory with four avours to all orders. our analysis uses the
s(2, z)-invariant curve and the two instanton contribution obtained earlier to x
the higher order contributions uniquely.

1 introduction

seiberg and witten [1, 2] proposed exact results for su(2), n = 2 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory with and without matter multiplets. these include, in particular
an exact expression for the mass spectrum of bps-states for these theories. their
solutions also provide a mechanism, based on monopole condensation, for chiral sym-
metry breaking and connement in n = 2 yang-mills with and without coupling to
fundamental hypermutiplets respectively. the results of seiberg and witten have been
generalised to a variety of gauge groups [3] describing a number of interesting new
phenomena [4].

on another front the low energy eective theories arising from non-abelian ym-
theory have been identied with those describing the low energy dynamics of certain
intersecting brane congurations in string theory [5]. the latter approach provides
an elegant geometrical representation of the low energy dynamics of strongly coupled
supersymmetric gauge theory.

for gauge groups su(2) and nf  3 massless avours it has since been shown
that the solution [1, 2] are indeed the only ones compatible with supersymmetry and
asymptotic freedom in these theories [6]. however, a number of issues have still resisted
an exact treatment so far. in particular the precise relation between the low energy
eective coupling ef f and the microscopic coupling  in the scale invariant nf = 4
theory has not been understood so far.
indeed, while the two couplings were rst
assumed to be identical in [2] it was later found by explicit computation that there
are, in fact, perturbative and instanton corrections [7]. on the other hand, explicit
instanton calculus is so far limited to topological charge k  2. a related observation
has been made in the d-brane approach to scale invariant theories. the details of the
conclusions reached there are, however, somewhat dierent [8].

the purpose of the present paper is to ll this gap. our analysis uses a combination
of analytic results from the theory of conformal mappings combined with the known
results form instanton calculus. more precisely we consider the sequence  7 z 
c 7 ef f . we will then argue that given the seiberg-witten curve together with some
suitable assumptions on the singular behaviour of the instanton contributions there is a
one-parameter family of admissible maps ef f 7  . the remaining free parameter is in
turn determined by the two-instanton contribution to the asymptotic expansion at weak
coupling. this coecient has been computed explicitly in [7]. this then determines
the map completely. although we are not able to give a closed form of the map
 7 ef f globally the higher order instanton coecients can be determined iteratively.
we further discuss some global properties of the map qualitatively. in particular we
will see that it is not single valued meaning that the instanton corrections lead to a cut
in the strong coupling regime. in this note we restrict ourselvs to gauge group su(2)
leaving the extension to higher groups [9] for future work.

2 review of n=2 yang-mills with 4 flavours

to prepare the ground let us rst review some of the relevant features [2] of the theory
of interest, that is n = 2 ym-theory with 4 hypermultiplets qr and qr, r = 1,   , 4, in
the fundamental representation. in n = 1 language the hypermultiplets are described

1

by two chiral multiplets containing the left handed quarks and antiquarks respectively.
these are in isomorphic representations of the gauge group su(2). the global symme-
try group therefore contains a so(8) or, more precisely, a o(8) due to invariance under
the z2 parity which exchanges a left handed quark with its antiparticle, q1  q1,
with all other elds invariant. at the quantum level this z2 is anomalous due to the
contributions from odd instantons.

we consider the coulomb branch with constant scalar  = a 6= 0 in the n = 2 vector
multiplet. this breaks the gauge group su(2)  u(1). the charged hypermultiplets
then have mass m =2|a| and transform as a vector under so(8), rather than o(8)
due to the z2-anomaly. in addition, there are magnetic monopoles solutions leading
to 8 fermionic zero modes from the 4 hypermultiplets. these turn the monopoles
into spinors of so(8). the symmetry group is therefore the universal cover of so(8)
or spin(8) with centre z2  z2. following [2] we label the representations z2  z2
by according to the spin(8) representations, that is the trivial representation o, the
vector representation v and the two spinor representations s and c. to decide in
which spinor representation the monopoles and dyons transform one considers the
action of an electric charge rotation eiq on these states. here the electric charge
q is normalised such that the massive gauge bosons have charge 2. this action is
conveniently described by
(1)
where states with even, odd ne are (1)h even, odd respectively. on the other hand,
for consistency, the monopole anti-monopole annihilation process requires a correlation
between chirality in spin(8) and electric charge [2]. we therefore identify (1)h with
the chirality operator in the spinor representations of spin(8). hence dyons with even
and odd electric charge transform in one or the other spinor representation of spin(8)
respectively.

eiq = einm(1)h,

the outer automorphism s3 of spin(8) that permutes the three non-trivial repre-
sentations v, s and c is closely connected to the proposed duality group sl(2, z) of the
quantum theory. indeed there is a homomorphism sl(2, z)  s3, so that the invari-
ance group of the spectrum is given by the semi direct product spin(8) and sl(2, z).
the kernel of this homomorphism plays an important part in our analysis below. it
consists of the elements in sl(2, z) that commute with the global symmetry group
sl(2, z). these are the matrices congruent to 1 (mod(2)). they are conjugate to the
subgroup 0(2). the fundamental domain of this subgroup is the space of inequivalent
coupling in the analysis presented below.

one can further formalise this structure in terms of the hyperelliptic curve that
controls the low energy behaviour of the model [2]. for this one seeks a curve y2 =
f (x, u,  ) such that the dierential form

has the periods ( ad

u , a

u ) with (ad, a) given by [2]

a = r u

2

and ad = ef f a

(2)

(3)

where ef f [7] is the low energy eective coupling whose dependence on the microscopic
coupling  will be determined below. the correct curve consistent with sl(2, z) duality
is given by [2]

y2 = (x  ue1( ))(x  ue2( ))(x  ue2( )),

where ei( ) are the modular forms corresponding to the three subgroups of sl(2, z),
conjugate to the index 3 subgroup 0(2). an equivalent form of the curve is obtained
by rescaling x = x0u, y = 1

2y0u3/2 i.e.
y2
0 = (x0  e1( ))(x0  e2( ))(x0  e2( )).

3 map:  7 ef f

we now have the necessary ingredients to determine the precise relation between ef f
and  . we begin with the observation that, according to the structure of the eective
theory presented above, the fundamental domain d of any of the three subgroups
conjugate to 0(2) can be used as the space of inequivalent eective couplings. the
three choices are then related by the spin(8) triality relating the 3 dierent non-trivial
representations v, s and c. each fundamental domain is described by a triangle in the
upper half plane (im( )  0), bounded by circular arcs [10]. the 3 singularities are
conjugate to the points (i,1, 1) corresponding to the weak coupling regime, massless
monopoles and massless dyons with charge (nm, ne) = (1, 1) mod(2) respectively.
in the absence of perturbative- and instanton corrections the eective coupling is
identied with the microscopic coupling  . this applies to n = 4 theories.
in the
scale invariant n = 2 theory considered here the situation is dierent. as shown in
[7], the eective coupling is nitely renormalised at the one loop level and furthermore
receives instanton corrections. some information about the fundamental domain d of
microscopic couplings  is obtained from the following observations:
a) as the microscopic coupling does not enter in the mass formula, its fundamental

domain is not constrained to be that of a subgroup of sl(2, z) [6]. nevertheless
we require that the imaginary part of  be bounded from below. correspondingly
the dierent determinations of  for a given ef f are related by a transformation in
p sl(2, ir). hence,

  c[h/g] where g  p sl(2, ir),

(6)

where c[ ] denotes a certain covering. this is a domain bounded by circular arcs,
conformally equivalent to the punctured 2-sphere, c  {a1,   , an} [10].
b) we know of no principle excluding the possibility that the number of vertices of
d be dierent from that of d. on the other hand such extra singularities have no
obvious physical interpretation. we therefore discard this possibility.

equipped with this information we will now determine the homomorphism that
maps d into the fundamental domain of microscopic couplings1 d. it follows from
general arguments [2, 7] that this map has an expansion of the form



ef f =

q = ei

the coecients ci, represent the perturbative one-loop (i = 0) and instanton (i > 0)
corrections respectively. the contributions from odd instantons to ef f vanishes. this
is due the fact that the part of the eective action determining the eective coupling
is invariant under the z2-parity. the rst two non-vanishing coecients of the
expansion (7) are known [7]

c0 =

and c2 =

(8)

to continue we use some elements of the theory of conformal mappings [10]. that
is we consider the maps from the punctured 2-sphere s = c{a1,   , an} to polygons
in the upper half plane, bounded by circular arcs. concretely we consider the sequence
ef f 7 z  s 7  (see fig.1). the form of such mappings is generally complicated.
however, their schwarzian derivative takes a remarkably simple form [10]

(9)

the parameters i measure the angles of the polygon in units of . the accessory pa-
rameters i do not have a simple geometric interpretation but are determined uniquely
up to a sl(2, c) transformation of s. furthermore they satisfy the conditions [10]

i = 0

(10)

in the present situation it is convenient to orient the polygons such that they have
a vertex at innity with zero angle (see fig. 1 ) corresponding to the weak coupling
singularity ( = ef f = i). the above conditions then simplify to



i = 0

(11)

xi=1
xi=1 (cid:16)2aii  2

i(cid:17) = (2  n).

as explained at the beginning of this section, in the case at hand, the polygon
on the ef f -side corresponds to the fundamental domain of 0(2). the corresponding
parameters (ai, i, i) are given by [6]

a1 = a1 = 1,

1 = 1 =

,

i = 0.

(12)

the parameters for the polygon on the  -side, (ai, i, i) are to be determined. how-
ever, the conditions (11) together with the symmetry    leaves only one free
parameter. indeed, without restricting the generality we can choose ai = ai. further-
more i =i. then (11) implies

1 =  1 =

4 (cid:16)1  2 1

2(cid:17)

(13)

leaving only one parameter, 1 say, undetermined. as we shall now see this parameter
is in turn determined by the two instanton contribution in (7). for this we make use
of the identity

to continue we invert (7) as

2  c4(cid:17) e4ic0q2

ef f + o(q4

ef f ).

(14)

(15)

finally we need the form of ef f (z), that is the inverse modular function for 0(2)
[11, 6]

ef f (z) =

 (cid:20)3 ln 2 + ln z

z2(cid:21) + o(z3).

substituting (17) into the right hand side of (14) we end up with

substitution of (18) into (14) then leads to

(19)

which then xes the erstwhile free parameter in {, z}. this is the result we have been
aiming at. indeed all higher instanton coecients are now determined implicitly by
the equation

{, ef f} =   z

ef f!2

[{, z}  {ef f , z}] .

(20)

in order to integrate (14) one notices [11] that any solution of (9) can be written

as a quotient

 (z) =

(u1(z) + du2(z))
(eu1(z) + f u2(z))

,

(21)

where u1, u2 are two linearly independent solutions of the hypergeometric dierential

then integrates (14) (fig. 1). to extract the instanton coecients one needs to invert

(27)

we close with the observation that globally the inverse function ef f ( ) cannot be
single valued. indeed, existence of a single valued inverse function z( ) requires 1 = p
or  = 1/p, p  z [11]. the physical interpretation is that the instanton corrected
eective coupling ef f ( ) has a cut somewhere in the strong coupling region. it would
be interesting to understand this property from the physics side.
