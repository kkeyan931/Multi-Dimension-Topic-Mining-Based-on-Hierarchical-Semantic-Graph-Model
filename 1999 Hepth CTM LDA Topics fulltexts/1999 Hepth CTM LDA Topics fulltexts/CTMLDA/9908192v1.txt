abstract

we examine the behaviour of killing spinors on ads5 under various discrete sym-
metries of the spacetime. in this way we discover a number of supersymmetric orbifolds,

reproducing the known ones and adding a few novel ones to the list. these orbifolds break

the so(4, 2) invariance of ads5 down to subgroups. we also make some comments on the
non-compact stiefel manifold w4,2.

1. introduction

supersymmetric compactications of type iib string theory on spacetimes of the form
ads5  x5 have yielded a number of interesting results about superconformal gauge the-
ory in four dimensions following the discovery[1] of the ads/cft correspondence. here
the compact manifold x5 can be the sphere s5, or one of many possible non-spherical
horizons including spherical orbifolds and other einstein spaces like the conifold base.

the presence of an ads5 factor guarantees conformal invariance of the dual eld
theory, while varying the x5 aects the spectrum of the eld theory and in particular the
total number of supersymmetries. recently a number of situations have been discussed
where instead one keeps x5 xed (for example, to be s5) and chooses dierent noncompact
einstein spaces in lieu of ads5. some examples of this are the ve-dimensional stiefel
manifold w4,2[2], spaces with a nontrivial h = db[3,4] and orbifolds of adsp[5,6,7,8].
the physical interpretation of all these spaces is not completely clear at present  for

example, some of the spaces discussed in [2,3,4] have singular behaviour at innity leading

to boundaries of dimension less than 4.

orbifolds of s5[9] are interesting because they allow us to design spacetimes that are

dual to a wide class of conformally invariant, supersymmetric eld theories in 4 dimensions.

some orbifolds of ads5 have been interpreted as topological black holes[5] generalizing the
famous btz black hole in 3 dimensions[10], while other orbifolds represent cosmological
solutions[6]1. a particular supersymmetric ads5 orbifold was discussed in ref.[8] where
it was proposed to be dual to a 3-brane eld theory with a pp-wave propagating on it.

hence in this example one nds a type iib supergravity background that is dual to a

3-brane worldvolume theory, not in its ground state but in a bps excited state. this is

an intriguing direction in which to generalize the ads/cft correspondence.

the purpose of this note is to examine conditions under which orbifolds of ads5 (with
or without xed points) preserve some supersymmetry. the analogous conditions for s5

have been analyzed in some depth in refs.[11,12]. one key result that helped in that

classication was a theorem relating killing spinors on einstein 5-manifolds to parallel

spinors on a 6d cone above them. however, one could also reproduce many of those
results by directly studying the transformation properties of killing spinors on s5 under

the orbifolding action.

1 much of the previous work on ads orbifolds deals with non-supersymmetric cases, and hence

our discussion below will not be closely related to it.

1

in what follows, we construct killing spinors on ads5 in three dierent coordinate

systems and examine their behaviour under various possible orbifolding actions. this en-

ables us to construct a number of supersymmetric orbifolds, including some known ones

and some that are apparently new. as we will see, dierent orbifolds can be conveniently

studied in dierent coordinates systems on ads5. a complete classication of orbifolds of

ads5, on the lines of refs.[11,12], would be interesting to attempt. this would perhaps fol-

low if one could prove a theorem relating killing spinors on a (non-compact) 5-dimensional

einstein space to spinors on a cone over it with two timelike directions.

we also compute killing spinors for w4,2 and discuss some supersymmetric orbifolds

of this space. the physical meaning of this space and its relevance to the ads/cft

correspondence are not very clear, and the same holds for the ads orbifolds we consider

except in a few cases. we leave the detailed analysis of this question, along with the study

of the global structure of these orbifold spacetimes, for the future.

like the cases discussed in refs.[8,2], the orbifolds discussed here break the so(4, 2)
invariance of ads5 down to subgroups, while preserving the s5 factor and hence the so(6)
symmetry associated to r-symmetry of the boundary cft. one can of course combine

the orbifolds discussed here with the ones proposed in ref.[9] to get compactications with

still lower symmetry and supersymmetry.

2. killing spinors on ads5

ads5 spacetime can be described as a hyperboloid in a 6-dimensional spacetime

with 2 timelike directions. labelling the coordinates of this ambient spacetime as
x1, x0, x1, . . . x4, the metric is

ds2 = (dx1)2  (dx0)2 + (dx1)2 + . . . + (dx4)2

and the equation of the hyperboloid is:

1 = (x1)2  (x0)2 + (x1)2 + (x2)2 + (x3)2 + (x4)2

the metric on ads5 is the one induced from the ambient space.

we will nd it convenient to work in three dierent sets of coordinates.

(2.1)

(2.2)

2

2.1. light-cone type coordinates

these consist of two pairs of lightlike coordinates and one complex coordinate. it is

dened by

z1 = x0  x1,

z2 = x2  x1, w = (x3 + ix4)

and the hyperboloid is

1 = z+

1 z1 + z+

2 z2 + ww

(2.3)

(2.4)

for this set of coordinates, it is convenient to choose an explicit basis for the gamma-

matrices as:

1 = 2  1, 2 = i3  1, 3 = 3  2, 4 = 3  3, 5 = 1  1

(2.5)

note that (2)2 = 1, while the other -matrices square to +1.

from the light-cone type coordinates we go to a set of ve independent coordinates
1, 2, , ,  where 0  2  , 0    2 and , and 1 are non-compact. these
coordinates are dened by:

z1 = cosh

z2 = sinh

w = sinh

1
2
1
2
1

e

cos

sin

2
2
2

e

ei

(2.6)

by abuse of notation we will refer to these also as light-cone type coordinates, though they

are actually an angular parametrization of those coordinates which solves the hyperboloid

constraint. the metric on ads5 in these coordinates is:

ds2 =  sinh2 1

(

(2.7)

for xed 2 and , the metric is proportional to that of ads3.

for this case, we have the vielbeins:

e1 =

(2.9)

note that the tangent-space metric has 22 = 1 while the other components are +1.

we are interested in studying the killing spinors on ads5 in this coordinate basis.

the relevant equation is:

( +

ab

(2.10)

it is fairly straightforward to compute the solutions to this equation, which are given by:

2 24e

2 3e

(2.11)

where 0 is an arbitrary constant spinor.

2.2. complex coordinates

another coordinate system will turn out to be useful to investigate a dierent class of

orbifolds. these will be called complex coordinates  they are actually complex coordinates

of the ambient 6-dimensional spacetime, a complex time and two complex space dimensions.

thus we dene:

u = x1 + ix0,

v = x1 + ix2, w = (x3 + ix4)

(2.12)

in terms of which the hyperboloid is

1 = uu + vv + ww

(2.13)

the coordinate w is the same as was used for the light-cone type coordinates. this time
it is convenient to go to ve independent coordinates 1, 2, , ,  where 0  2  ,
0  , ,   2 and 1 is non-compact. these coordinates are dened by:

u = cosh

v = sinh

w = sinh

(2.14)

again, although these angles parametrize the complex coordinates in a way which solves

the hyperboloid constraint, we will refer to the angles themselves as complex coordinates.

note that these coordinates can be obtained from the previous ones by the formal

replacement  = i and  = i, which interchanges one space with one time direction.

this replacement in eq.(2.7) also gives us the metric in these coordinates. it is evident

that the vielbeins are formally the same as before, though the tangent-space metric now

has 33 = 1. careful inspection shows that the spin connections also turn out to be
exactly the same as in eq.(2.9), as the sign changes introduced by the interchange of a

space and a time direction eventually cancel out. the change of tangent space metric

necessitates a slightly dierent basis of -matrices. we multiply 2 of eq.(2.5) by i and
3 by i. hence the new set of -matrices (which we label  to avoid confusion with the

previous set) becomes:

1 = 2  1, 2 = 3  1, 3 = i3  2, 4 = 3  3, 5 = 1  1

(2.15)

this time, (3)2 = 1 while the others square to +1. the advantage of this choice is that
we nd (formally) the same killing spinor as in eq.(2.11), but now with the -matrices:

2.3. horospherical coordinates

let us nally recall[13] the killing spinors in horospherical coordinates, which consist

of ve independent real coordinates, r, x1, x2, x3, x4 in terms of which the metric is:

ds2 = (dr)2 + e2r((dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2 + (dx4)2)

(2.17)

choosing the  matrices as

1 = i3  2, 2 = 3  1, r = 3  3, 3 = 1  1, 4 = 2  1

(2.18)

the killing spinor is found to be[13]:

(2.21)

3. orbifolds of ads5

3.1. half-supersymmetric orbifolds

now we will examine the orbifolding actions which are natural in the various coor-

dinates. in the light-cone type coordinates, one natural action follows from the following

transformation:[8]:

z1  e2/kz1 ,

z2  e2/kz2

which can be expressed as a simple translation:

   +

2
k

,

   +

2
k

6

(3.1)

(3.2)

from eq.(2.4), this clearly has no xed points, since the hyperboloid does not pass through
z1 = z2 = 0. in order for the killing spinor  to be invariant under the above transfor-
mation we must require that the constant spinor 0 satisfy



k (24+3)0 = 0

e

(3.3)

which means the matrix (24 + 3) must annihilate 0. in the basis chosen in eq.(2.5),
we have:

24 + 3 = 2(cid:18) 0

0 2(cid:19)

0

(3.4)

and hence the killing spinors that are preserved, in this basis, are the ones for which

0 =

(1)
0
(2)
0
0
0







(3.5)

this in particular gives a direct proof that the orbifold discussed in ref.[8] preserves half

the supersymmetries.

the above orbifold action is generated by an su (1, 1) matrix in the full isometry group

so(4, 2) of ads5, hence the surviving symmetry group is the commutant of su (1, 1) in
so(4, 2) which is su (1, 1)  u (1). this is analogous to the fact that the simplest half-
supersymmetric orbifold of s5 (corresponding to d3-branes at an ale singularity) has an
r-symmetry group su (2)  u (1).

turning now to the complex coordinates, it is natural to consider orbifold actions of

the type

u  du,

v  av,

w  bw

(3.6)

where  = exp(2i/k) and a, b, d are some integers. these are quite analogous to corre-
sponding orbifolds of s5. the result is also analogous: the orbifolding action above leaves

the killing spinor invariant if

(a24 + d3 + b15) 0 = 0

(3.7)

the above matrix has eigenvalues (a + b  d), (a + b + d), (a  b + d) and (a  b  d).
if one of a, b, d is zero then we have two vanishing eigenvalues and 1

2 -supersymmetry.

7

note, however, that because of the signature of the spacetime, all the 1

2 -supersymmetric
cases are not equivalent. the case with d = 0 has a circle of xed points uu = 1, while the

cases with a = 0 or b = 0 have no xed points and are equivalent to each other.

in the case d = 0, the orbifold generator lies in an su (2) subgroup of so(4)  so(4, 2)
hence the symmetry of the quotient space is su (2)  u (1). on the other hand, for
a = 0 or b = 0 the orbifold is generated by an element in an su (1, 1) subgroup of
so(2, 2)  so(4, 2) and the surviving symmetry is su (1, 1)  u (1).

next, it is useful to examine the orbifold described in eq.(3.1), in horospherical coor-

dinates. the action becomes:

r  r + a,

x+  x+,

x  e2ax,

x3  eax3,

x4  eax4,

(3.8)

hence the killing spinor transforms as

  e 1

2 a(13)





(r+a)

2

e

((1)

0 + x+(2)

0 + ea(x3  ix4)(3)

(3)
0

(r+a)

2

e

((4)

0 + e2ax(3)

0 + ea(x3 + ix4)(2)
0 )





(3.9)

thus the killing spinors that are preserved by this orbifold, in this basis, are the ones for
which

another apparently trivial kind of 1
0 = (3)

2 -supersymmetric orbifold is apparent from
eqn.(2.19). suppose we choose (2)
0 = 0. then the killing spinor becomes in-
dependent of x, x3, x4. as a result, periodic identications in these coordinates preserve
the killing spinor. this is essentially what was noted in ref.[13], and corresponds to the
fact that the identication of these coordinates breaks conformal invariance by introduc-

ing a scale, hence the conformal part of the superconformal invariance goes away. thus
such orbifolds preserve half the supersymmetries. (one can further deform the space in
the x3, x4 directions and add a nontrivial b-eld, preserving the remaining supersymme-
try, as was done in ref.[3,4]. in this case one does not expect the deformed manifold to

have a killing spinor, since the eld strength db also contributes to the supersymmetry
variation.)

3.2. one-fourth supersymmetry

we have already considered orbifold actions, in complex coordinates, of the general

type

u  du,

v  av,

w  bw

(3.11)

where  = exp(2i/k) and a, b, d are some integers. we saw that the relevant matrix acting
on killing spinors has eigenvalues (a + b  d), (a + b + d), (a  b + d) and (a  b  d).
hence if all of a, b, d are nonzero then at most one of these eigenvalues can be zero and in
that case we have a 1
4 supersymmetric cases we have

4 -supersymmetric orbifold. for the 1

no xed points for the orbifold action.

the orbifold generator lies in an su (2, 1) subgroup of so(4, 2), hence it preserves
only a u (1) symmetry. this is the analogue of the u (1) symmetry preserved by 1
4 -
supersymmetric orbifolds of s5, which is realized as a u (1) r-symmetry in the boundary

theory.

another class of 1

4 -supersymmetric ads5 orbifolds comes from quotienting by a pair
of transformations each of which preserves half the supersymmetry. if (k, k) are co-prime
there are two inequivalent cases:

u  u,
v  v,

u  u,
u  u,

v  1v
w  1w

v  1v
w  1w

and

where k = ()k

= 1.

(3.12)

(3.13)

another interesting 1

4 -supersymmetric orbifold arises by combining the periodic iden-
tication in x2, x3, x4 in the horospherical coordinates, with the orbifolding action of
eq.(3.8). here the constant killing spinor satises (2)

0 = 0.

0 = (3)

0 = (4)

we have encountered a number of supersymmetric orbifolds, but it turns out that each

of them is natural in a certain coordinate system and not so easy to describe in another.

thus, it becomes hard to combine the dierent actions discussed in the previous section

and nd more general orbifolds. for example, one of the simplest orbifolds described in

complex coordinates in eq.(3.6) arises by choosing k = 2, d = a = 1, b = 0. this just
corresponds to the reection u  u, v  v. in terms of the light cone type coordinates

9

this means zi  zi , which cannot be carried out using the independent coordinates
dened in eq.(2.6), which only cover the region z1 > 0.

in contrast, the orbifold corresponding to k = 2, a = b = 1, d = 0 can be realized in
the light cone type coordinates. in this case we have v  v, w  w. this corresponds
to the action

w  w
which in terms of the independent coordinates in eq.(2.6) is just

z+

z+
1  z1 ,

(3.14)

(3.15)

this acts on the killing spinor in eq.(2.11) as follows. in our basis, this killing spinor is

0 1(cid:19)  = (3  1)

(3.17)

this coincides with the lorentz transformation of  under the action in eq.(3.15)2

2 the action in eq.(3.15) inverts the sign of the vielbeins e1, e3, e4, e5, hence it must be repre-
sented on spinors by a matrix p which anticommutes with 1, 3, 4, 5. thus p is proportional
to 2 = i3  1. since p 2 = 1, it follows that p = 3  1.

10

thus we see (as expected from the analysis of the same orbifold in complex coordi-

nates) that this orbifold preserves half the supersymmetries. but now that we know the

preserved killing spinors in the basis appropriate to light-cone coordinates, we can combine

this orbifold with the orbifolding along lightlike directions dened in eq.(3.1) and deter-

mine if there is any residual supersymmetry. indeed we have seen that eq.(3.1) preserves

killing spinors of the form eq.(2.11) where the constant spinor 0 has the form:

0 =

(1)
0
(2)
0
0

while eq.(3.15) preserves killing spinors where 0 has the form

this is a zz2 orbifold of ads5. it is much more dicult, if not impossible, to express the
zk orbifold given in complex coordinates by v  v, w  1w, k = 1 in terms of light-
cone coordinates. luckily it is not necessary to do this. these orbifolds preserve the same
killing spinors for all k. since we have shown that for k = 2 there is a 1
4 -supersymmetric
z  z2 orbifold obtained by combining with the action eq.(3.1), it follows that there is
also a z  zk orbifold with 1

4 -supersymmetry for all k.

4. the stiefel manifold w4,2

although not directly related to orbifolds of ads5, the noncompact stiefel manifold
4 -supersymmetric coset spacetime. we will speculate later on its

w4,2[2] is an interesting 1

11

possible relation with ads5 orbifolds. in the present section we will compute its single
killing spinor and comment on orbifolds of this spacetime.

this case corresponds to an analytic continuation of the compact manifold variously

denoted t1,1 or v4,2, which is the base of the conifold geometry and hence appears in
the study of d3-branes at conifolds[14]. it can be thought of as the coset space (ads3 
ads3)/u (1), and also as a (timelike) u (1) bration above euclidean ads2  ads2. the
natural coordinates for w4,2 are (1, 1, 2, 2, ) where 0   < 4, 0  i < 2 while i
are noncompact. in terms of these, the metric of w4,2 is

ds2 =

which explicitly exhibits the u (1) bration, with  being the bre coordinate.

this spacetime breaks the maximal so(4, 2) isometry to so(2, 2)  so(2), much as
its compact version breaks the maximal so(6) isometry of s5 to so(4)  so(2). from

it is easy to see that there are no other solutions to the coupled set of equations. for each
of the components (1), (2), (3), there is an irrational factor 6 in one or other equation,
which implies that we can never get a solution that is single-valued in the angles 1, 2.

thus, as expected, there is a single killing spinor for this manifold, proving explic-
4 -supersymmetry. the killing spinor has the very simple form given

itly that it has 1

13

in eq.(4.11), and is quite similar to a solution obtained in ref.[15] in the context of 7-

dimensional einstein spaces.

because this killing spinor depends only on , any orbifold of w4,2 by an action under
which spinors transform trivially (such as a translation in the angles) will preserve it. one
example is provided by the zk  zk transformation:

1  1 +

,

2  2 +

(4.12)

this introduces conical singularities into the euclidean ads2 factors that make up the
base of w4,2, but as usual one expects that string propagation on this space is smooth.

5. discussion

we have constructed kiling spinors in various coordinate systems and thereby discov-

ered a number of supersymmetric orbifolds of ads5. one should attempt to understand
the global properties and causal structure of such spacetimes. some of them are already

known to be topological black holes.

one interesting proposal emerges from our discussion. there is an ads5/z2 orbifold
with a circle of xed points, very similar to the s5/z2 orbifold obtained by placing d3-
branes at a z2 ale singularity. both are cases of 1
2 -supersymmetry. now for the latter,
it is known[14] that blowing up the circle of xed points is a relevant deformation which
causes the theory to ow to the 1
4 -supersymmetric theory obtained by replacing s5/z2
with the stiefel manifold v4,2. the corresponding conformal theories ow from n = 2 to
n = 1 and can be obtained very simply by rotating branes in a brane construction[16,17].

one could perhaps expect an analogous blowup of our ads5/z2 orbifold to lead to the
non-compact stiefel manifold w4,2 discussed in ref.[2]. the physics of this would be quite
dierent from the compact case and possibly very interesting3.

z-orbifold discussed there and explicitly shown that it is 1

in comparing our results with those of ref.[8], we nd that we have reproduced the
2 -supersymmetric, which is im-
portant for the identication proposed with pp-waves on a brane. however, it is not clear
if we have found the z  z orbifold that also nds brief mention in their work. this is
supposed to be dual to a 3-brane with a pp-wave together with a d-instanton, and one
would expect it to be 1

4 -supersymmetric. we have found two 1

that include the action in eq.(3.1). one is found by adjoining the z action which com-

pacties one or more of the spatial coordinates in the brane, as discussed below eq.(3.13).

the other is obtained by adjoining a zk action, as discussed after eq.(3.20). in neither of
these cases does the second orbifold group appear symmetrically with the rst, while the

authors of ref.[8] seem to suggest that such an example should exist. we hope to return

to this point in the future, along with a study of the physical interpretation, in terms of

the brane worldvolume theory, for the various orbifolds we have constructed here.

the compactication of type iib string theory on ads5  s5 possesses a remarkable
symmetry between the two factors. geometrically, the only dierence is that while s5
solves a quadratic equation in r6, ads5 solves a quadratic equation in r4,2. this sym-
metry is not reected in the emergence of this background as the near-horizon geometry
of d3-branes, where r6 has a physical interpretation as the at space transverse to the
3-branes, but r4,2 does not appear. one may speculate that such a symmetry may be

visible or partly visible in f-theory, which can sometimes be given a 12-dimensional inter-

pretation. this philosophy has been partially explored in ref.[8] using earlier observations

in ref.[18]. it would be interesting to nd out whether such a symmetry can be exploited

to systematically classify the supersymmetric orbifolds of ads5.
