abstract

we investigate the convergence of the derivative expansion of the exact renormaliza-
tion group, by using it to compute the  function of scalar 4 theory. we show
that the derivative expansion of the polchinski ow equation converges at one loop
for certain fast falling smooth cutos. the derivative expansion of the legendre ow
equation trivially converges at one loop, but also at two loops: slowly with sharp cut-
o (as a momentum-scale expansion), and rapidly in the case of a smooth exponential
cuto. finally, we show that the two loop contributions to certain higher derivative
operators (not involved in ) have divergent momentum-scale expansions for sharp
cuto, but the smooth exponential cuto gives convergent derivative expansions for
all such operators with any number of derivatives.

1 introduction and discussion

it is obvious that there is a need to have good analytic non-perturbative approxima-
tion methods for quantum eld theory. the exact renormalization group provides a
powerful framework for formulating such approximations because the calculations can
be phrased directly in terms of renormalized (i.e. continuum) quantities, thus triv-
ially preserving a crucial property of quantum eld theory, namely renormalizability
(equivalently the existence of a continuum limit) [1, 2]. in recent years it has been
established that the derivative expansion of the eective action, taken to some nite
order, provides a robust and accurate non-perturbative approximation for scalar eld
theory [1][20].

whilst the validity of this statement currently rests mainly on empirical fact, it
is proven that the derivative expansion behaves correctly in various limits. we know
that the lowest order of the derivative expansion (the local potential approximation
[3]) is in a sense exact in the large n limit (of e.g. the n-vector model) [4, 5, 6].
the form of the large eld behaviour is also correctly reproduced by the expansion
[2, 7, 8].

of course it is a challenging task to prove the applicability of the derivative ex-
pansion non-perturbatively and in all generality. note in particular that this is not a
controlled expansion in some small parameter. the approximation lies in neglecting
higher powers of p/, where  is the eective cuto and p some typical momentum.
but in the ow equations, the typical momenta that contribute are themselves of
order . thus the expansion is a numerical one, and an important but dicult ques-
tion to answer is whether this numerical series converges, and indeed if so, whether
it converges to the exact value.

here we establish and extend some results on the weak coupling regime, rst
announced in [9]. in particular we show that for the legendre ow equation and an
exponential cuto, the derivative expansion computation for the  function of 4
theory1 converges at one and two loops to the correct result.

we see then that the derivative expansion interpolates between exact results in a
number of dierent limits, and in particular must be accurate even at only-moderately
weak coupling. viewed from this perspective, it is hardly surprising that the fully
non-perturbative results tend to be so accurate [1][20].

on the basis of intuitive arguments and preliminary calculations, one of us sug-
1in four dimensions with    symmetry

gested that the momentum expansion of the legendre ow equation with sharp cuto,
should converge most rapidly [1, 10]. in fact, while for the legendre equations all
cutos trivially supply the exact answer for the  function at one loop, the two-loop
sharp cuto result converges only very slowly to the exact answer. utilising these
results we can see that the derivative expansion result for the two-loop contribution
to the four-point vertex, but expanded to second or higher order in external momenta,
in fact fails to converge for sharp cuto. actually these results again concur with the
phenomenology, since non-perturbatively, results with sharp cuto are consistently
worse than smooth cuto versions [8, 11].

a similar investigation for smooth cuto shows that the derivative expansion series
converges at two loops, no matter how high order the expansion in external momenta
is taken.

the derivative expansion of the polchinski ow equation fails to converge even at
one loop for sharp-cuto, power-law cuto, exponential cuto and many other similar
forms. remarkably however, we identify some forms of steeply falling cuto that do
result in convergence. their existence underpins the competitive results that may be
obtained with this method to o(2) [13][15]. (these results tend to be obtained for
all cutos, and depend on a nite number of parameters: none for o(0), three for
o(2) [13][2, 7, 9, 14].)

momentum scale expansions with sharp cuto and derivative expansions with
power-law cuto, applied to the legendre ow equations, share the property that
reparametrization invariance is preserved [7, 9]. however, we will show that derivative
expansions with power law cuto actually fail badly at two loops, in the sense that
at some order greater than o(4) (which we determine) the result is innite because
the momentum integrals fail to converge. the reason is that high order derivative
expansions with power-law cuto result in contributions that actually diverge for
small coupling and therefore fail even qualitatively in this regime. these conclusions
are puzzling in view of the very competitive non-perturbative o(2) results obtained
with power-law coupling [6][9, 11, 16].2

of course it must be borne in mind that there is no real conict here: it is quite
possible that these o(2) approximations provide accurate models for scalar eld
theory, especially since they interpolate between exact results in various limits, even
if the higher orders of the derivative expansion do not result in convergent series. it
is rather that convergence of the derivative expansion at low orders of the coupling

2however, exact o( 2) results with exponential coupling do appear to be better still [19].

guarantees the accuracy of high orders of the derivative expansion in this regime.

all the calculations presented in this paper have been performed directly in terms
of renormalized quantities, which is one of the beauties of this approach [1, 2, 21], but
we have explicitly checked that the same results are obtained with the traditional
approach of introducing an overall cuto 0 and allowing this to tend to innity.

there are many possible extensions of this work. these are discussed at the
end of the paper. the plan for the rest of the paper is as follows.
in section 2
we consider the wilson/polchinski ow equation, demonstrate that the correct 
function appears at one loop for any cuto when solved exactly, and then analyse
the numerical series that follows from the derivative expansion. apart from the
summary, the remaining sections are concerned with the legendre ow equations.
section 3 treats one loop order. the derivative expansion has no eect in this case
and the correct  function is always obtained. in section 4 we discuss the specic
case of the sharp cuto legendre ow equation, calculating the two-loop  function
as a convergent momentum-scale expansion.
in this section we also identify the
momentum-squared operator whose series fails to converge. section 5 treats the case
of a smooth exponential cuto, demonstrating that the resulting numerical series for
the two-loop  function converges rapidly to the correct result. this time considering
higher powers of external momenta does not alter the conclusions: all these operators
have convergent series. finally, in section 6 we show how the power law cuto fails
at two loops. section 7 contains a summary and a discussion of future directions.

2 wilson/polchinski ow equation

as wilson showed [22] the renormalization of quantum eld theories can be under-
stood within the context of the ow of an eective action s[] with an eective
ultra-violet (uv) cuto . polchinskis version [23] of the ow equation can be ob-
tained from that of wilson by substitution [7].

firstly, let us dene a modied propagator u v such that u v = cu v (q2/2)/q2.
cu v (x) is an as yet unspecied function3 which acts as an uv cuto and hence has
the properties cu v (0) = 1 and cu v  0 (suciently fast) as q  . similarly we
can dene ir = cir(q2/2)/q2, where cir = 1 cu v behaves as an infrared cuto.
following ref.[1] we dene k = d
d u v and expand the ow equation for the n point
3x here stands for q2/2. cu v is a function of only this, by lorentz invariance and dimensions.

where i1 and i2 are disjoint subsets of external momenta such that i1  i2 =  and
i1  i2 = {p1,   , pn}. the sum over {i1, i2} utilises the bose symmetry so pairs
are counted only once i.e. {i1, i2} = {i2, i1}. the momentum p1 is dened to be
p1 = ppii1pi.

we rst consider the four point vertex exactly (i.e. without a derivative expansion)
and obtain the exact  function. we dene the renormalized coupling  to be the
four point vertex at zero momentum. the only contribution comes from the tree level
six point function with two legs tied together to give the diagram in g 1.

the tree level six point vertex follows from integrating up (1) with  as the four-

vertex. substituting back into (1) we thus have (compare [1, 21])

where in (4) the prime means dierentiation with respect to x and in (2) the tree-level

we do not need an overall cuto (0), but instead go direct to the continuum limit
(0 = ). using the denition of cir = 1  cu v , we see that the  function

reader that the one and two loop  function coecients are universal for massless

 ) is correctly [24] reproduced as

now consider evaluating the eective action in terms of a derivative expansion.
this means that the ir in (3), which is the momentum dependent part of the
classical six-point contribution, must be expanded in q. the intermediate result (4)
is thus replaced by

where c (n)
u v is the nth x-derivative of cu v (x). taking the specic example of sharp
cuto cu v = (1  x) we trivially obtain convergence to the wrong answer, namely
zero, since c (n)
u v (0) = 0 for all n  1. however for sharp cuto, the derivative
expansion actually does not exist, and a careful determination of the sharp cuto
limit leads one to the legendre equations even in the exact case [10]. therefore we
will consider the sharp cuto from now on only in the legendre ow equations. if we
choose a cuto that decays as a power of q2, it is clear that at some n the integral
in (6) diverges. in order to avoid this problem we must make the cuto decay faster
than a power. if we choose an exponential cuto of the form cu v = eq2/2
however,
we still have problems:

 =

(4)2



xn=1

(1)n+1.

(7)

clearly this does not converge.
in fact, the reader can readily conrm that expo-
nential decay with any power (cu v = exm) still fails to give a convergent derivative
expansion. the  1/n! behaviour of the taylor expansion coecients is not enough
in these cases to overcome the  n! behaviour of the integrals. clearly any cuto
that behaves as  exm for large x will thus also fail. indeed if these cutos are not
entire as functions of complex x, the taylor expansion coecients will decay only as
a power  1/rn (r the distance from the origin to the nearest singularity) and will
result in badly divergent numerical series.

5

however, we can obtain convergence if we insist that the uv cuto is entire but
falls fast enough as x   to ensure that the integrals in (6) grow much slower than
n! 4 with cu v (x) = exp (1  ex) for example, we obtain

 =

32
(4)2 {1.193 + 0  0.194  0.060 + 0.032 +   } ,

(8)

with the series in braces summing to 1.000286 after twelve terms. with cu v =
exp {e  exp (ex)} we obtain

 =

32
(4)2 {1.278  0.164  0.130  0.014 + 0.019 +   } ,

(9)

which also converges, with the series in braces summing to 0.999551 after twelve
terms. (the integrals of (6) were calculated numerically.)

it would be very interesting to investigate if these forms of cuto yield convergent
derivative expansions at higher loops also. however, in this paper we now turn to
the legendre ow equations: these have inherently better convergence properties at
the very least because, being 1pi (one particle irreducible), there are no tree-level
corrections and thus numerical series arising from derivative expansion do not appear
until the two loop level.

3 legendre ow equation at one loop

following the notation of ref.[1], see also [17, 18], we have the legendre ow equation
for a general cuto (with the vacuum energy dropped):




[c] = 

1
2

tr(

k

(1 + ir)2 ..(1 + [1

ir + ]1.)1) ,

(10)

where [c] is the generator of 1pi greens functions, c is the classical eld, [c]
the second eld dierential less , the eld independent part i.e. the eective self
energy. eqn (10) can be expanded in terms of c to give the expanded legendre ow
equation although care is required when taking the sharp cuto limit [1, 10]. however

4in the limit of sharp cuto the integrals are all 1.

6

at one loop (irrespective of exact form of cuto), the only contribution to the ow of
the four point function will arise from




(p1, p2, p3, p4; ) = z d4q
 x{i1,i2}

(2)4 k(q)

(q,q  p1, i1; )ir(|q + p1|)(q  p2,q, i2; ),

(11)

where the notation is the same as used in (1). with  dened as the four-point 1pi
vertex at zero momenta and substituting  the tree-level result, in the right hand
side, this reduces to




 = 32z d4q

(2)4

1

q4   d

d

cir(q2/2)! cir(q2/2)

(12)

derivative expansion corresponds to an expansion in the external momenta of s
vertices, but in this case the relevant vertices have no external momentum dependence.
it is easy to see that (12) is the same as (3) and thus for the legendre equations, even
in the derivative expansion, we obtain the exact one-loop  function 32
(4)2 irrespective
of the exact form of cuto function.

4 sharp cuto at two loops

with due caution the sharp cuto limit [cu v = (  q)] of (10) is taken [1], and
after expanding in c we obtain the sharp cuto expanded legendre ow equation
for n external momenta:




(p1,   , pn; ) = z d4q

(2)4

(q  )
q2 + (q; )

e(q, p1,   , pn; ),

(13)

where

e(q, p1,   , pn; ) =

(q + p1,q + p2, i3; )g(|q  p2|; )(q  p2,q, i2; )
.

(14)

similarly to before, pi = ppj ii pj and p{i1,i2},i3,,im is a sum over disjoint subsets
ii  ij =  (i, j) with sm
i=1ii = {p1,   , pn}. again, the symmetrization {i1, i2}

means this pair is counted only once. g(p; ) is dened by

g(p; ) 

(p  )
p2 + (p; )

,

(15)

where  is again the (eld independent) self energy.

by iteration we can now solve (13) to two loop order. we split the four point

function into two parts, momentum free [()] and momentum dependent [21]:

(p1, p2, p3, p4; ) = () + (p1, p2, p3, p4; ),

where

(0, 0, 0, 0; ) = 0.

upper limit to be set as . in (19) we perform the 1 integral, noting that eectively

may be expanded in momentum-scale pi = |pi| [1, 10] to give (20). alternatively the

at two loops, the diagrams in (b) and (c) of g 2 will contribute to the  function.
diagram (a) might be expected to be included, however on setting external momenta
to zero the iterand of this topology vanishes by (17). the reason is that in calculating
renormalized quantities directly, (a) is already incorporated in the one-loop running
(). (in the more traditional calculation, (a) only has a divergent part which is then
removed on renormalization.)

in here, the rst o(3) term arises from the expansion of the self energy (23), i.e.
topology g 2(c). the next also gives rise to topology (c), but is now generated by
the one-loop six-point vertex with two legs tied together. the six-point vertex also
provides the next two terms in the form of g 2(b). the nal line arises from iterating
the four-point function of (20) in the ow equation.

be shown that these self energy terms cancel for any cuto. neither is aected by
momentum-scale expansion, since no external momentum dependence is involved. in
the next two contributions the momentum expansion does aect the embedded one-
loop terms and corresponds in this case to an expansion in q/p. proceeding as before,
we obtain the expansion of the rst of these to be

our observation below (28) however, shows that for second order in the external
momentum, equivalently o(2) operators, the nth coecient of momentum-scale ex-
pansion is eectively multiplied by  n2. for an o(2r) operator, the qn term is that
of the derivative-free operator (i.e. with the same number of elds) with qn replaced
by  (cid:16) n/2
2r (cid:17) qn2rk2r which yields a multiplier  n2r for large n. unless the coecients
in the numerical series fall faster than a power of n (e.g.  1/n! or 1/rn, r > 1), we
will be able to nd a suciently high derivative operator whose derivative expansion
series fails to converge. while (probably) all but one of the sharp-cuto series do have
coecients that fall faster than a power of n, the slow series (25) barely manages to
converge at all. thus it is clear without calculation, that the contribution g 2(b)

we see that for smooth exponential cuto, the derivative expansion series all have
coecients that fall at least as fast as 1/rn, with r > 1. (it may be shown that
the nth term in (41) falls faster than 1
it follows then, from
the discussion at the end of the previous section, that the diagrams of g 2 and
g 3 expanded to the (2r)th power of the external momenta, still yield convergent
derivative expansion series in this case. in fact the situation is even better than this.
as before, the k2r term (k some external momentum) eectively converts the power
q2n in the expanded terms of (40) to  n2rk2rq2n2r, but here the coecients of q2n
go like  1/n! or better and the power of q is integrated against eq2/2
. converting
q2n to q2n2r means that the 1/n! is now incompletely cancelled by the q integral,
leaving a remainder  1/n2r for large n. thus the net result is that not only do the
series for all the higher derivative operators converge, they converge just as fast as
the zero external momentum diagrams!

6 power law cuto

the nal cuto we consider is that of a power law i.e. cu v (q, ) = 1/[1 + (q/)2+2]
where  is a non-negative integer. recall that this leads to a well dened derivative
expansion to all orders if  > d/21 [7] (in the sense that all the momentum integrals
converge, d being the space-time dimension). despite this, problems arise with the
integrals at two loops, when we consider perturbation theory. for example, consider
the integral pertaining to g 2(b), obtained by the iteration of the four-point function
at one loop. we have the following contribution to two-loop  function:

(46)

derivative expansion requires the inner integral (the one-loop four-point function)
to be expanded in powers of its external momentum q. the expansion of one-loop
terms always exists to all orders but, once the power q2m is such that m   + 1 (or
 + 3  d/2 in general space-time dimension), the second loop integral over q, fails
to converge. in this case, even the coecients of the derivative expansion series are
innite. in the worst case,  = 2, this happens at o(6).

16

at rst sight there is a conict with our earlier statement, that the integrals
converge if  > d/2  1. the resolution is that, non-perturbatively there exists also
a factor  1/[q2 + cir]3 from (32) and (33).5 for small ,   2q2m at o(2m),
from g 3. the extra powers of q in the denominator always stabilise the integral
providing  > d/2  1, but clearly the integral will then diverge as   0. a
little further analysis taking into account the powers of  in the four-point functions,
shows that in the problematic cases of o(2m) with m  +3d/2, the contribution
behaves overall at small  as  p where p =  2(mk)+d4
is a negative fractional
power. obviously then, although the integrals converge, the results are qualitatively
unacceptable.

m1

clearly these problems are generic, i.e. not just for contribution g 2(b).

7 conclusions and outlook

we summarise each case in turn.

using the wilson/polchinski equation, the one-loop  function calculation com-
puted via a derivative expansion, results in a divergent numerical series for any cutos
falling as a power or as the exponential of any power, in agreement with ref. [9]. sharp
cutos require the use of the legendre ow equations or equivalent in any case. how-
ever, convergent numerical series are obtained for certain entire fast falling cutos
such as cu v (x) = exp (1  ex), or cu v = exp{e  exp (ex)}.

for the legendre ow equations and any cuto, the one-loop  function is exact

within the derivative (or momentum-scale) expansion.

derivative expansions of the legendre ow equations using power law cutos
 1/x, fail rst at two loops, again as reported in ref. [9]. in fact here the o(2m)
result, where m   + 3  d/2, diverges. the reason is that certain contributions at
these orders diverge for small coupling , and thus these o(2m) results are simply
qualitatively incorrect in this regime. in d = 4 dimensions this problem rst appears
at o(6).

the two-loop  function computed via a momentum-scale expansion using sharp
cuto, yields overall a slowly converging numerical series. the same diagrammatic
contributions expanded to o(k2) in external momenta k result in series that fail

5recall that these equations hold non-perturbatively, and it is still the case that the four-point

functions in e need expanding as a power series in q.

17

to converge. these investigations improve on those reported in ref.
[9] where we
claimed on the basis of incomplete calculations that the two-loop  function yields a
fast converging series [1, 10]. in fact as we have seen, all contributions converge very
fast except for one, which turns out to be only very slowly converging. the analogous
contribution to this, at o(k2), fails to converge at all.

finally, the two-loop  function computed via a derivative expansion of the leg-
endre eective action and using an exponential cuto cu v (x) = ex, yields a fast
converging numerical series and moreover, the same diagrams expanded to any power
of the external momenta give series that converge just as fast. these results verify
and extend those reported in ref. [9].

clearly we can conclude that sharp cutos and power law cutos have inher-
ent limitations, which is rather a shame since these are the only two cutos that
continue to preserve reparametrization invariance, when combined with derivative /
momentum-scale expansions [7, 9].

on the other hand, use of the legendre ow equation and exponential cuto 
precisely as favoured by a number of authors [5, 18, 20], yields series that converge
very well to two loops. although our work has been limited at two loops to two-
point and four-point vertices, it is natural to speculate that convergence is found for
all operators at two loops. certainly it is possible to investigate other, or maybe
all, operators with the techniques used here. although we concentrated on four
dimensions, it is clear (from the discussion at the end of sect.5), that convergence
will be obtained in any dimension d. naturally the question arises, what happens
at three loops? these calculations are slightly more involved over and above the
extra loop, because there are now two levels of embedding of subdiagrams, each
needing expansion to a given order in the derivative expansion. nevertheless these
investigations again look possible and the results would be very interesting.

the use of cu v (x) = ex is certainly very helpful in these investigations since the
derivative expansion coecients can be calculated exactly, as we have seen. clearly
the cuto must fall faster than a power, but what else is required to obtain good
results?

although we have identied certain cutos to use with the wilson/polchinski
equation that give convergent series for the one-loop  function, we did not investigate
whether these series converge for higher derivative operators. this would seem to be
an important and straightforward investigation. another important question is the
behaviour at two loops (and higher).

18

clearly we leave many questions unanswered.

(we have to stop somewhere!)
nevertheless it must be stressed again that the proof of convergence in the many
examples we have worked out here, guarantee the accuracy of high orders of the
derivative expansion for these quantities in the small coupling regime. with the
derivative expansion known to be exact in various other limits (as reviewed in the
introduction), these results further help to explain the impressive accuracy that may
be obtained with these methods.
