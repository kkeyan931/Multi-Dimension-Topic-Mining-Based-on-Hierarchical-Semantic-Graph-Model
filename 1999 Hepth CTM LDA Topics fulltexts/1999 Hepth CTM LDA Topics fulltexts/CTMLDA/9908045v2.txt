abstract

the nature of -symmmetry transformations is examined for p-branes
embedded in a class of coset superspaces g/h, where g is an appropriate
supergroup and h is the lorentz subgroup.
it is shown that one of the
conditions z m em
a = 0 which characterizes -symmetry transformations
arises very naturally if they are implemented in terms of a right action of
a subgroup of the supergroup g on the supergroup elements which repre-
sent the coset. unlike the global left action of g on g/h (which gives rise
to supersymmetry on the coset superspace), there is no canonically dened
right action of g on g/h. however, an interpretation of this right action
involving an enlargement of the isotropy group from the lorentz subgroup
to a subgroup of g with generators which include some of the fermionic gen-
erators of g is suggested. closure of the generators of this larger subgroup
under commutation leads to the usual brane scan for p-branes which have
bosonic degrees of freedom which are worldvolume scalars.

1 introduction

kappa symmetry is a local fermionic symmetry of covariant green-schwarz
actions [1] for p-branes.
it is a generalization of local fermionic symme-
tries discovered for massive [2] and massless [3] superparticle actions. the
presence of the -symmetry in the green-schwarz action for a p-brane en-
sures that only half of the supersymmetry generators are realized nonlinearly,
as required for low energy eective actions describing the long wavelength
excitations of bps solitons [4, 5]. the standard procedure for forming -
symmetric green-schwarz actions in at superspace is the nonlinear sigma
model approach [6, 7]. the kinetic term is a natural generalization of the
nambu action, to which is added a wess-zumino term formed by integrat-
ing a closed form in superspace over an embedded manifold whose boundary
is the worldvolume of the p-brane2. global supersymmetry of the action is
ensured by constructing both pieces of the action in terms of the vielbein on
at superspace. the -symmetry is then a eld dependent local fermionic
transformation for which the variations of the the kinetic term and the wess-
zumino term can be made to cancel by appropriate choice of the normaliza-
tion of the wess-zumino term. this procedure has recently been extended
to the case of superspace backgrounds which are more general cosets than
at superspace [8].

progress has been made in achieving a geometric understanding of kappa
symmetry using the formalism of super-embeddings [9], based on doubly su-
persymmetric approaches to superstrings which incorporate both manifest
worldvolume and spacetime supersymmetries [10] (for a recent review of su-
perembeddings including a comprehensive list of references, see [11]). the
worldvolume of the p-brane is extended to a supermanifold which is embed-
ded into the target superspace in such a way that the odd subspace of the
worldvolume tangent space is a subset of the odd subspace of tangent space to
the target superspace. in such a formulation, the fermionic kappa symmetry
can be related to the worldvolume supersymmetry.

it has been noted in the past that in at superspace, the -symmetry
transformation of the bosonic superspace coordinate is like a wrong-signed
supersymmetry transformation [12].
in terms of the construction of at
superspace as the left coset g/h of the super-poincare group g with the

2only p-branes which have bosonic degrees of freedom which are worldvolume scalars

will be considered in this paper.

lorentz subgroup as the isotropy group h [13], and in which supersymmetry
transformations of the superspace coordinates are achieved by the canoni-
cally dened left action of the superalgebra on the coset superspace, this
is an indication that -symmetry transformations should be related to the
right action of the superalgebra on the same coset. in the hamiltonian for-
mulation for p-branes embedded in at superspace, de azcarraga, izquierdo
and townsend [14] showed that the fermionic constraints (some of which are
rst class, corresponding to the existence of local -symmetry) are analo-
gous to supercovariant derivatives in superspace, which generate right super-
translations. since left and right supertranslations commute, this provides
a means to implement fermionic constraints which are consistent with the
global supersymmetry generated by left supertranslations. more recently
bars, deliduman and minic [15] have implemented -symmetry transforma-
tions for a number of non-at coset superspaces in terms of a local right
action.

the aim of this paper is to point out that for a general class of coset
superspaces, -symmetry transformations do indeed have a natural interpre-
tation in terms of a local right action, as opposed to the global left action
which gives rise to the supersymmetry. in particular, after a review of the
relevant properties of coset spaces in 2 and a discussion of relevant coset
superspaces in the rst part of 3, it will be shown that the criterion

z m em

a = 0

which characterizes -symmetry transformations in curved superspace [16,
17] is very naturally implemented for coset superspaces g/h in terms of a
local right action of a part of the supergroup g. although only the left ac-
tion of the supergroup g on the coset superspace g/h is canonically dened
(this is the usual nonlinear realization of g on g/h, which is independent of
a particular parameterization of the coset), it is argued that the local right
action associated with the -symmetry transformations is also well-dened,
and should be interpreted as giving rise to an enlargement of the isotropy
group h from the lorentz subgroup to a larger subgroup h which includes
fermionic generators. this is consistent with the role of -symmetry in co-
variant green-schwarz actions, which is to ensure that although there appear
to be goldstone fermions associated with all the supersymmetry generators,
in fact only half of them are physical, meaning that only half of the super-
symmetry is realized nonlinearly, with the rest of the supersymmetry being

2

in 4, this interpre-
realized linearly on the physical degrees of freedom.
tation is expanded to include the worldvolume dieomorphisms, which also
eliminate some of the apparent goldstone degrees of freedom in covariant
green-schwarz actions. it is argued in 5 that consistency of this picture re-
quires that the generators of the right actions associated with the -symmetry
transformations and the worldvolume dieomorphisms must form a closed
superalgebra, from which emerge the usual restrictions on relationship be-
tween the dimension of the worldvolume of a p-brane and the dimension of
the spacetime into which it is embedded (the brane-scan [18]).

2 some preliminaries

we begin by reviewing relevant details of coset spaces3 and nonlinear realiza-
tions. consider a lie algebra g with generators ta satisfying the (possibly
graded) commutation relations

[ta, tb] = ifab

c tc.

let t i denote the generators of a subalgebra h of g (the unbroken gener-
ators), and ta denote the remaining generators of g (the broken genera-
tors), and assume that the ta provide a representation of h under commuta-
tion4. a slice through g locally isomorphic to g/h can be parameterized
in the form

g(z) = exp(iz m m

ata),

(1)

with the z m furnishing local coordinates on g/h. there is a canonical global
left action of g on g/h under which the point with coordinates z is mapped
by xed g  g into the point with coordinates z  determined by

g.g(z) = g(z ).h(z, g).

(2)

here, h(z, g) is the compensating h-transformation required to bring g.g(z)
back onto the slice (1) isomorphic to g/h. the realization of the group g
on the coordinates z is nonlinear.

3 the cosets considered in this paper are always left cosets.
4 the index conventions to be used are as follows: indices i, j, k, . . . are used for the
generators of h; indices a, b, c, . . . are used for generators of g not in h; and m, n, . . .
are used for coordinates on g/h.

3

the cartan one-form g(z)1dg(z) dened on g/h takes values in the

complexication of the lie algebra of g and can be decomposed as

g(z)1dg(z) = i dz m em

a(z) ta + i dz m m

i(z) t i.

(3)

i (z)t i  h, the forms ea(z) = dz m em

these forms are invariant the global left action of g on g/h since d(g.g(z)) =
g.dg(z) if g is constant. under the local right action g(z)  g(z).h(z) with
h(z) = ei
a(z) transform as a viel-
i(z) transforms
bein on the tangent bundle to g/h, while  i (z) = dz m m
as a connection on this bundle (see, for example, [19]). the maurer cartan
equations 0 = d(g(z)1dg(z)) + g(z)1dg(z)  g(z)1dg(z) can be written
in the form

ec(z)  eb(z)fbc

(4)

so that the left-hand sides of these expressions are respectively the torsion
and curvature of the coset space.

replacing d by  in (3), an innitesimal variation z m of the coordinate
z m on g/h will induce a variation g(z) of the representative group element
g(z) which satises

g(z)1g(z) = i z m em

a(z) ta + i z m m

i(z) t i.

(5)

consider now the right action of the group g on the representatives5 g(z)

of the points in the coset g/h. in particular, consider

g(z)  g(z).ei(va(z)ta+w

i (z)t i ).

since the new group element will lie on the h-orbit of some point on the
slice, one has

g(z).ei(va(z)ta+w

i (z)t i ) = g(z ).h(v, w, z)

(6)

for some h(v, w, z)  h. in innitesimal form one obtains

g(z ) = g(z).(cid:16)1 + iva(z)ta + iw i(z)t i)(cid:17) .(cid:16)1  i i(v, w, z)t i(cid:17) ,

5note that there is no canonical right action of the group g on the (left) coset space
g/h, unlike the case of the left action of the group. the right action considered here is
in general dependent on the choice of the slice g(z).

4

where  i(v, w, z) is linear in va(z) and w i(z). this yields

g(z)1g(z) = iva(z)ta + i(cid:16)w i(z)   i(v, w, z)(cid:17) t i.

comparing (5) and (7),

va(z) = z m em

a(z)

which allows z m to be computed given va(z). the remaining relation

i(z) = w i(z)   i(v, w, z)
determines the compensating lorentz transformation  i.

3 coset superspaces

the analysis of -symmetric green-schwarz actions for p-branes in an generic
ten or eleven dimensional superspace backgrounds [17, 21] is complicated by
the fact that there is no general prescription for the construction of the su-
perelds which correspond to a given bosonic background [20]. however, the
fact that at superspaces can be considered as cosets of the super-poincare
group with the lorentz subgroup as the stability group [22] allows a geomet-
ric formulation of the green-schwarz action in terms of a nonlinear sigma
model on the coset space [6, 5, 23]. recently, this construction has been
extended to the case of superspaces whose bosonic parts correspond to the
near horizon geometries of various p-brane solitons, which are of the form
adsp+2  sdp2. the corresponding superspaces can be realized as coset
spaces g/h for some choice of supergroup g and bosonic stability group h,
particular cases of interest being

ads5  s5 = su(2, 2|4)/ (so(1, 4)  so(5))
ads4  s7 = osp(8|4)/ (so(1, 3)  so(7))
ads7  s4 = osp(6, 2|4)/ (so(1, 6)  so(4)) .

(10)

these correspond respectively to the d3 brane in d = 10 iib supergravity
[8], the m2 brane in d = 11 supergravity, and the m5 brane in d = 11
supergravity [24, 25].

the coset superspaces g/h above are based on supergroups g with gen-
erators which will be denoted pa, q and jab. the jab are generators of a

5

lorentz subgroup h, under which the even generators pa transform as a
vector and the odd generators q transform as spinors:

[jab, pc] =

[jab, q] =

i
2 (cid:16)ac b
i
[a, b]
8

d  bc a
 q.

d(cid:17) pd

(11)

the remaining (anti)commutation relations for the lie algebra of the su-
pergroup g will not be specied, except to require that the algebra has a
contraction to the usual (possibly extended) supersymmetry algebra, as a
result of which the anticommutator of odd generators takes the form

{q, q} = 2(ca) pa + if

abjab.

(12)

this structure encompasses the super-poincare group appropriate to the con-
struction of at superspaces, as well as the more general supergroups in the
coset superspaces (10). the coset superspaces can be parameterized in the
form

g(z) = ei(xmm

apa+q)  eizm m

ata,

where z m = (xm, ), and ta = (pa, q) are the broken generators (and
t i = (jab) are the unbroken generators).

evidence is now provided for the identication of the -symmetries of the
green-schwarz actions in these coset superspaces g/h with a right action6
of the the supergroup g. the canonically dened global action of an element
g  g on the coset superspace is determined the left action g.g(z), as in (2).
a green-schwarz action is automatically invariant under this group action
since it is constructed from the cartan forms g(z)1dg(z). consider instead
the local transformation

g(z)  g(z ) = g(z) eiva(z)ta eiab(v,z)jab,

with vata = vapa + vq. as noted earlier, the right action of the group
on representative of cosets does not descend to a canonically dened trans-
formation on g/h : the transformation z  z (z) determined by (6) is
6the term action appears twice in this sentence, once in the context of the integral of
a lagrangian, and once in the context of transformations on a group manifold generated
by the group structure; in future use of this term, it should be clear from the context
which of these is applicable.

dependent on the choice of slice g(z). in innitesimal form, the relationship
between va(z) and z = z   z is given by (8),
a(z),

va(z) = z m em

where em
0 corresponds to the condition

a(z) is the vielbein on the coset superspace. thus, setting va(z) =

0 = z m em

a(z).

so the condition that z m em

this is one of the criteria which characterize a -transformation on the
worldvolume of a p-brane embedded in a curved superspace [16, 17]. it de-
termines the transformation xm of the even superspace coordinates of the
embedded worldvolume in terms of , the variation of the odd coordinates.
a(z) vanishes is naturally implemented in
terms of a local right action depending only on the fermionic generators of
the supergroup7. as there is no canonically dened right action of g on g/h,
the implementation of a -transformation in the above fashion would seem
to depend on the parameterization of the coset superspace. however, this is
not true provided the right action is a local symmetry ; it is then a reection
of the presence of unphysical degrees of freedom which can be eliminated by
a choice of gauge for the local symmetry.

the latter principle is well known in the standard construction of a sigma
model (not necessarily supersymmetric) with a target space which is a coset
space. generically [26], one starts with an action of the form

s = z dx (g1mg)a (g1mg)b ab

i (x)t i )  g, with t i the generators of h, and where
where g(x) = expi(a(x)ta+
ab is a h-invariant metric. the sigma model possess a local symmetry
under the right action of h since (g1mg)a transforms linearly under such
transformations (assuming the generators ta provide a representation of h
under commutation with the t i). this gauge symmetry can be xed by
setting  i to zero, giving a parameterization of g/h in a physical gauge in
7of course, there are additional criteria which a -symmetry transformation must fulll,
as will be discussed shortly. in particular, only a subset of the supersymmetry generators
is involved in a -symmetry transformation, and this subset depends on the point on the
embedded worldvolume.

7

terms of the slice g() = eiata. since it is constructed from the cartan form
g1dg, the action s also has a global symmetry under the left action of g. in
particular, this global left action gives a linear realization of the subgroup h
on the physical degrees of freedom a, while the rest of the generators of g
are realized nonlinearly. even in the physical gauge, there is still a symmetry
under the local right action of h.

in the case of p-brane actions in coset superspaces g/h, a local symmetry
under the right action of a lorentz subgroup h has been xed in choosing a
apa+q). if the
slice g(z) which is parameterized in the form g(z) = ei(xmm
wess-zumino term is appropriately normalized, then the action possesses a
-symmetry, which, as argued above, takes the form of a local right action
generated by a subset of the supersymmetry generators. although this right
action is not well-dened on g/h, it suggests that the theory really describes
degrees of freedom on a smaller coset space g/ h, where h  h includes an
appropriate subset of the fermionic generators. in this case the right action
is well-dened, independent of the parameterization of g/h with which the
construction starts. further, under the left action of g, the fermionic gener-
ators in h will be realized linearly on the physical degrees of freedom, while
the remaining fermionic generators will still be nonlinearly realized. this is
precisely the requirement for the eective action describing the low energy
excitations of a bps state which preserves only half the supersymmetry. it
is this interpretation of -symmetry which we wish to pursue. it should be
pointed out that the situation is actually more subtle, because the subgroup
h varies from point to point of the embedded worldvolume.

to illustrate the above, we review p-branes in at superspace, which is
a coset superspace g/h with g a super-poincare group and h its lorentz
subgroup. the coset is parameterized in the form g(z) = ei(xapa+q), and
the cartan form

g(z)1dg(z) = iapa + idq

= i(cid:16)dxa  i(ad)(cid:17) pa + i dq

(13)

provides a vielbein on at superspace which is invariant under global super-
symmetry transformations

xa = i(a),

in innitesimal form, the local right action g(z)  g(z) eiq induces the
transformations

(a compensating lorentz transformation is not required in at superspace).
the vielbein transforms as

a = 2i (ad),  d = d.

the lorentz invariant metric ab on the bosonic part of at superspace can
be pulled back to the (p + 1)-dimensional worldvolume of the p-brane to yield
a worldvolume metric

where i are coordinates on the worldvolume. the kinetic term s0 in the p-
brane action is a generalization of the massive spinning particle action, being
proportional to the volume of the woldvolume with respect to the induced
metric:

s0 = z d(p+1) det g.

since a can be written in the form

iapa = g(x, )1dg(x, ),

where dg = dg  ig (dq) is a covariant derivative of g, a transforms
linearly under the local right action g(z)  g(z) eiq. however, gij is not
invariant under this transformation because ab is an invariant metric only
for the lorentz subgroup of the super-poincare group, with the result that
the variation of the kinetic term in the p-brane action is

 z d(p+1) det g = 2iz d(p+1) det g (ii).

(15)

here, the i are worldvolume gamma matrices obtained by pulling back the

in the usual manner for the construction of sigma models with degrees of
b could be contracted with an
freedom on a coset space [26], if i
invariant metric for the full super-poincare group, then an action could be
constructed with a local fermionic symmetry. it would describe degrees of
freedom living in the space of left cosets of at superspace under the local

fermionic transformation g(z)  g(z) eiq. however, an appropriate invari-
ant metric does not exist.
as is now well known, it is possible to obtain partial invariance with

respect to the local right action. the matrix8

has the property 2 = 1, and commutes with the worldvolume gamma ma-
trices i when p is even and anticommutes with them when p is odd. the
generators jij =  i
8 [i, j] therefore yield a reducible representation of the
worldvolume lorentz group, and the projection operators p = 1
2 (1  )
provide a decomposition of this reducible representation into two parts. if it
is possible to nd a contribution sw z to the action such that under the local
transformations

(s0 + sw z) = 4 iz d(p+1) det g (p ii),

then s0 +sw z will be invariant under transformations g(z)  g(z) eiq with
 = p+. these are the -symmetry transformations, which allow half of the
fermionic degrees of freedom to be gauged away.

a contribution sw z to the p-brane action with the required transfor-
mation property under the local right action and which is invariant under
global supersymmetry (or a global left action) exists only for at superspaces
in which the (p+2)-form

h = i[ p+1

2 ] i
p!

a1  a2      ap (d a1a2    apd)

is closed; this leads to the brane-scan restricting the relationship between
the dimension of the worldvolume and the dimension of the spacetime in
which it is embedded [18]. the closure of this form is equivalent to the
integrability of

sw z = 2 iz d(p+1) det g (  ii),

8we use the convention di0  di1  dip = d(p+1) det g i0i1 ip. also, a rotation

to a euclidean metric has been made for convenience.

10

in the sense that only in these cases is there a local quantity sw z whose
variation yields the right hand side of (16). this is similar to the wess-
zumino consistency condition for anomalies [27].

in this case, the p-brane action is

s0 + sw z = z d(p+1) det g + z b,

 denotes the embedding of the worldvolume into superspace, and b is a
(p+1)-form dened by db = h. to see how this expression for the wess-
zumino term arises, note that sw z can be written in the form

sw z = i[ p+1

2 ] 2 i

p! z di1      dip+1 (cid:16)i1    ipip+1(cid:17)

given because dt (a) = 0; for a more general path (t), there would be such terms, in

under the bosonic part of the innitesimal right action.

note that although at superspace can be constructed as a coset space
of the super-poincare group by the lorentz group, it is in fact itself a group,
the super-translation group (as emphasized in [7]). so the left and right
actions of the super-translation group on at superspace are well-dened.
this is reected in the fact that no compensating lorentz transformation
is required in the denition of the right action of the super-poincare group
on g(z) = ei(xapa+q). the entire discussion of p-branes in at superspace
above can therefore be carried out without reference to cosets. nevertheless,
it is useful to consider at superspace as a coset space, because it makes
obvious the origin of the local lorentz invariance of the p-brane action, and
also because it points to the generalizations required for coset superspaces
g/h which are not groups and for which there is no naturally dened right
action of g.

4 incorporating worldvolume dieomorphisms

returning to the case of p-brane actions in general coset superspace back-
grounds, they are by construction also invariant under worldvolume dieo-
morphisms. this ensures that there are only physical goldstone modes cor-
responding to the generators pa of superspace translations which are broken
by the embedding of the p-brane into superspace. the unphysical bosonic
goldstone degrees of freedom in the covariant green-schwarz action can be
eliminated by a choice of gauge for the worldvolume dieomorphisms. since
symmetry with respect to the worldvolume dieomorphisms performs the
same role as the -symmetry transformations, namely the elimination of un-
physical goldstone degrees of freedom, then if the above interpretation of
the -symmetry transformations as enlarging the isotropy group in the con-
struction of the coset superspace is correct, the worldvolume dieomorphisms
should also have an interpretation in terms of the local right action of a sub-
group of the supergroup g on the coset superspace g/h. this is indeed the
case, as we now demonstrate.

if z m () denotes the embedding of the (p + 1)-dimensional worldvol-
ume (with coordinates i) of a p-brane into the coset superspace, then since
the spacetime coordinates are worldvolume scalars, they transform under

12

an innitesimal worldvolume dieomorphism generated by the worldvolume
vector eld vi() 

i as

vz m () = vi()

using (8) and (9), such a transformation of the spacetime coordinates is

5 the algebra of -transformations and dif-

feomorphisms

both the -symmetry transformations and the dieomorphisms are local
symmetries which remove unphysical goldstone degrees of freedom from the
covariant green-schwarz action for a p-brane propagating in a coset super-
space g/h, leaving physical goldstone modes only for those generators of
the supergroup g which are broken by the embedding of the p-brane in su-
perspace. in the left action of g on g/h, the broken generators are realized
nonlinearly on the physical degrees of freedom, while the unbroken genera-
tors are realized linearly. as already mentioned, this is naturally achieved if
the -symmetry transformations and the dieomorphisms arise from a local
right action of special linear combinations of the generators of the super-
group g on the coset superspace representatives g(z()); however, for this
picture to be consistent, these linear combinations of generators must close
under commutation and so generate a subgroup of the supergroup. this will
then have the eect of enlarging the isotropy group of the coset superspace
to a subgroup h which contains these linear combinations of generators in
addition to the lorentz generators. the subgroup h varies from point to
point on the embedded worldvolume.

it has already been demonstrated in a general context that both the -
symmetry transformations and the dieomorphisms can indeed be realized in
terms of a local right action. it thus remains to show that the corresponding
generators form a subalgebra of the full superalgebra g. in other words, it is
necessary to show that the generators of -symmetry transformations, world-
volume dieomorphisms and lorentz transformations form a closed algebra
under commutation if the above interpretation of these transformations as
local right actions is to be consistent.

before calculating the appropriate commutators, the form of -symmetry
transformations in a general coset superspace must be specied. as in at
superspace, they involve the pullback to the worldvolume of various struc-
tures on the coset superspace. these include the worldvolume metric, which
is the pullback of the lorentz invariant metric ab :

gij() = ei

a(z()) ej

b(z()) ab,

where ei

a = zm

a. similarly, worldvolume gamma matrices are obtained

has the same properties as in the case of at superspace, and the projection
operators p = 1
2(1) provide a decomposition of the spinor representation
of the worldvolume lorentz group provided by the worldvolume gamma ma-
trices into two parts. a related projection operator is the symmetric tensor

if  = eaa is a bosonic one-form on the coset superspace, then ka

the -symmetry transformations for a p-brane embedded in at super-

note that the transformation refers to a particular point z() on the em-

in a curved coset superspace, the point g(z()) ei()p+()q no longer lies on
the slice g(z) = eizm m
ata, and so a compensating lorentz transformation
is necessary if -symmetry transformations are to take this form. alterna-
tively, by the same method used in the case of dieomorphisms, it is possible
to implement the -symmetry transformation in such a manner that a com-
pensating lorentz transformation is not necessary, in which case the right
action is of the form

g(z())  g(z ()) = g(z()) ei()p+()q+i(p+c1)e

in the appendix, it is shown that for innitesimal worldvolume dieo-
morphisms and -symmetry transformations, dened in terms of the right
actions (18) and (21), the following commutation relations hold:

[v1, v2] = v3
[v, ] = ,

(22)

1)  vj

1(jvi

3 = vj

2(jvi

2) and  = vii. the rst commutator yields
with vi
the expected algebra for worldvolume dieomorphisms, and the second com-
mutator is consistent with long-established properties of the algebra of -
symmetry transformations [1, 23].

the commutation relations (22) are valid independent of the dimension
of the spacetime formed by the coset superspace into which the p-brane is
embedded. however, this is not true for the commutator [1, 2] of a pair of
-symmetry transformations. as shown in the appendix, such a commutator
yields a linear combination of a dieomorphism (parameterized by the world-
volume vector eld vi = 2i(2p+ip1)), a lorentz transformation and
another -symmetry transformation11 if the following conditions are satised:
(i) the dimension of the spacetime into which the p-brane is em-

bedded is such that the gamma matrix identities

for p = 1 and

0 = (ca)( (ca))

0 = (ca1)( (ca1a2ap))

for p > 1 are true (the round brackets on spinor indices denote symmetriza-
tion). this yields the usual brane scan for p-branes whose bosonic degrees
of freedom are worldsheet scalars [18].

11the calculation in the appendix does not give the explicit form of the lorentz trans-
formation and the -symmetry transformation, although these could be extracted with a
little more eort. also note that conditions (i) and (ii) are only shown to be sucient
rather than necessary conditions for the algebra to close.

16

(ii) for p > 1, the additional condition 0 = (pi)

ei

 must also

be satised.
condition (ii) is one of the equations of motion for a p-brane, namely that
which follows from

s = z d(p+1) det g (z m )em

(cpi)ei



(23)

 of the p-brane action s. this is consistent with
under a variation (z m )em
 = (p+c 1). as discussed
the existence of a -symmetry form (z m )em
in the case of at superspace, (23) can be taken as a denition of the p-brane
action [28], in that integrating this gives the usual p-brane action (with the
kinetic term coming from the piece in p proportional to 1 and the wess-
zumino term coming from the piece in p proportional to ). so except for
p = 1 (a string), the algebra of dieomorphisms and -symmetry transfor-
mations closes only on-shell. it is interesting that requiring the algebra of
the -symmetry transformations, worldvolume dieomorphisms and lorentz
transformations to close on itself yields a condition which can be used to
construct the p-brane action.

6 conclusion

the suggestion [12, 14, 15] that -symmetry transformations are related to
the right action of the supergroup g on a coset superspace g/h has been
examined for a special class of coset superspaces which are currently of in-
terest in studies of p-branes propagating in curved spacetimes. it has been
shown that the condition

z m em

a = 0

which is accepted as one of the hallmarks of a -symmetry transformation
for p-branes embedded in curved superspaces [16, 17] arises very naturally
if the -symmetry transformation is implemented in terms of a right ac-
tion of the supergroup g on g/h. further, a physical interpretation of this
right action in terms of an enlargement of the isotropy subgroup from the
lorentz subgroup of g has been suggested. this is consistent with the role of
both worldvolume dieomorphisms and -symmetry transformations in co-
variant green-schwarz p-brane actions, namely in the elimination of unphysi-
cal goldstone degrees of freedom. requiring that the algebra of worldvolume
dieomorphisms, -symmetry transformations and lorentz transformations

17

closes on itself at each point of the embedded worldvolume leads to the usual
brane scan for p-branes with worldvolume degrees of freedom which are
scalars [18]. in the case p > 1, closure of the algebra also requires that one
of the usual equations of motion for a p-brane be true. it was pointed out
that this condition can in fact be used to reconstruct the p-brane action.

it is interesting to speculate on the relationship of the approach in this
paper to the original formulation of the brane scane in terms of the exis-
tence of suitable closed dierential forms in the embedding superspace from
which the wess-zumino term in the covariant green-schwarz p-brane ac-
tion can be constructed [18, 7]. the closure of the algebra of worldvolume
dieomorphisms, -symmetry transformations and lorentz transformations
corresponds to an integrability condition on certain vector elds, and this
usually has a dual formulation in terms of dierential forms. the results of
this paper are presumably also closely related to the geometric interpretation
of -symmetry transformations in terms of superembeddings [10, 9, 11].

appendix

in this appendix, the conditions under which the generators of dieomor-
phisms and -symmetry transformations form a closed algebra under com-
mutation are examined.

consider rst the dieomorphisms, generated by the right action (18).
the generator of dieomorphisms depends on the point z() on the em-
ab(z()) (the
bedded worldvolume through the presence of ei
latter vanishes in at superspace). thus, if a pair of dieomorphisms are
successively applied, the generator of the second dioemorphism depends on
the point z  resulting from the rst dieomorphism:

a(z()) and i

g(z)  g(z) eivi

1()(ei

a(z)ta+i

ab(z)jab) eivj

2()(ej

b (z )tb +j

cd(z )jcd).

for innitesimal dieomorphisms, the arguments of the exponentials can be
combined as

2 (v1ej

cdjcd).

if the dieomorphisms are performed in reverse order, the same expression
with 1 and 2 interchanged results. the commutator of a pair of dieomor-
phisms is the dierence of these expressions. using the result (19) and the
expression (4) for the torsion and curvature of the coset superspace, one nds

[v1, v2] = v3

with vi

3 = vj

2(jvi

in checking the commutator of a dieomorphism and a -symmetry trans-
formation, the variations of the pulled back vielbein and connection are re-
quired:

where (p+c 1em ) = (p+c 1)e

evaluated at a point z() on the the embedded worldvolume. the results
(24) are obtained by computing g(z )1 
i g(z ) with g(z ) given by (21).

to a sum over the spacetime vector degrees of freedom which are transverse
to the worldvolume. in computing p+, it is necessary to use the fact that
d, and that det g i0i1ip

transforms as a scalar.

a anticommutes with c(1  k)c

a = iei

as with the commutator of a pair of dieomorphisms, in computing the
commutator of a dieomorphism and a -symmetry transformation, the sec-
ond transformation acts at a transformed point, and one nds

by computing g(z )ig(z ) with g(z ) given by (21), the rst three terms in
this expression are easily shown to be

combining this with the fact that v = vii for worldvolume scalars yields

the third and fourth terms on the right-hand side cancel against the m
dependent pieces of the last two terms, which are obtained from (24) and (25).
to show that the remaining q dependent terms constitute a -symmetry
transformation, it is only necessary to show that the pieces proportional to
pq vanish, as a -symmetry transformation is generated by ip+q (plus
a piece which can be absorbed into a lorentz transformation) and so only
involves p+q. thus it suces to prove

ab

0 = 2(2p+ip1)( eipq) + (1p+aei)(2aipq)

(2p+aei)(1aipq).

the sums over the restricted range a in the last terms (i.e. over spacetime
vector indices transverse to the worldvolume, see after equation (25)) can be
replaced by unrestricted sums by inclusion of appropriate projection opera-
tors, and the required identity is

0 = 2(
(

(26)

where  = p and the upper sign in a given term in (26) refers to the case
p even, while the lower sign refers to the case p odd. the distinction between
p even and p odd arises because for p even

while for p odd,

pip = 0, pap = 0,

pip = 0, pap = 0.

for the case p = 1, (26) is easily shown to be true if the spacetime gamma

matrix identity

(ca)( (ca))

21

applies (where the round brackets denote the totally symmetric piece). the
gamma matrix identity is applied to the second term, and use must be made
of the fact that

(

[i, j]  = 2

i i1ip i1    ip
i[ p+1
2 ]
(p  1)!

i j i2ip i2    ip.

(27)

for the case p > 1, the situation is a little more complicated. the identity
(26) can be proved in spacetime dimensions for which the gamma matrix
identity

0 = (ca1)( (ca1a2ap))

is true, where a1a2ap is the totally antisymmetric product of p gamma
matrices. to apply the gamma matrix identity, we write

(

1 ae

i )(

2 aiq) = i[ p+1

2 ] 1
p!

i i1ip

(

1 ae

i )(

2 a i1ip1 ipq).

if, in addition, the condition

0 = (piei) = (ie

(28)

is satised, then the gamma matrix identity (after use of (27)) yields

0 = (
