we describe physical phenomena associated with a class of transitions that occur in the

study of supersymmetric three-cycles in calabi-yau threefolds. the transitions in question

occur at real codimension one in the complex structure moduli space of the calabi-yau

manifold. in type iib string theory, these transitions can be used to describe the evolution

of a bps state as one moves through a locus of marginal stability: at the transition point

the bps particle becomes degenerate with a supersymmetric two particle state, and after

the transition the lowest energy state carrying the same charges is a non-supersymmetric

two particle state.

in the iia theory, wrapping the cycles in question with d6-branes

leads to a simple realization of the fayet model: for some values of the cy modulus gauge

symmetry is spontaneously broken, while for other values supersymmetry is spontaneously

broken.

1. introduction

in the study of string compactications on manifolds of reduced holonomy, odd-

dimensional supersymmetric cycles play an important part (see for instance [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

and references therein). in type iib string theory, a supersymmetric three-cycle can be

wrapped by a d3-brane to yield a bps state whose properties are amenable to exact

study; in the iia theory or in m theory, euclidean membranes can wrap the three-cycle

and contribute to holomorphic terms in the low energy eective action of the spacetime

theory (that is, terms that are integrated over only a subset of the fermionic superspace

coordinates).

of particular interest, partially due to their role in mirror symmetry [5,7], have been

special lagrangian submanifolds in calabi-yau threefolds. in an interesting recent paper

by joyce [10], various transitions which these cycles undergo as one moves in the complex

structure or kahler moduli space of the underlying cy manifold were described. in this

note, we study some of the physics associated with the simplest such transitions discussed

in 6 and 7 of [10]. these transitions are reviewed in 2. the physical picture which one

obtains by wrapping d3-branes on the relevant cycles in iib string theory is described in

3, while the physics of wrapped d6-branes in type iia string theory occupies 4. our

discussion is purely local (in both the moduli space and the calabi-yau manifold), as was

the analysis performed in [10]; we close with some speculations about more global aspects

in 5.

at all points in this paper, we will be concerned with rigid special lagrangian three

cycles. since the moduli space of a special lagrangian three cycle n (including wilson

lines of a wrapped d-brane) is a complex kahler manifold of dimension b1(n ) [11,6], this

means we have to focus on so-called rational homology three spheres with h1(n, zz) at

most a discrete group. we will further assume that h1(n, zz) is trivial.

2. splitting supersymmetric cycles

2.1. denitions

let m be a calabi-yau threefold equipped with a choice of complex structure and

kahler structure. let  be the kahler form on m , and let  be the holomorphic three-form,

normalized to satisfy

  

3
3!

=

i
8

1

(2.1)

this also allows us to dene two real, closed three forms on m , re() and im().

let n be an oriented real three-dimensional submanifold of m . we call n special

lagrangian with phase ei i

a) |n = 0
b) (sin()re()  cos()im())|n = 0

(a) and (b) together imply that

zn

(cos()re() + sin()im()) = vol(n )

(2.2)

where vol(n ) is the volume of n .

physically, the relevance of  for us will be the following. let n and n  be three-
cycles which are special lagrangian with dierent phases  and . compactifying, say, iib

string theory on m , we can obtain bps states which preserve half of the n = 2 spacetime
supersymmetry by wrapping three-branes on n or n . in the notation of [1], the surviving

supersymmetries in the presence of a d3-brane on n , for example, are generated by

 = ei+ + ei,

with  =  

4 . for generic  6= , however, n and n  preserve dierent n = 1
supersymmetries and the state with both wrapped three-branes would break all of the

2  

supersymmetry.

2.2. transitions

the following supersymmetric three-cycle transitions are conjectured by joyce to occur

in compact calabi-yau threefolds m .

choose two homology classes   h3(m, zz) which are linearly independent in

h3(m, ir). for any   h 3(m,c), dene

   = z



(2.3)

thus  are complex numbers. following joyce, dene a subset w (+, ) in h 3(m,c)

by

w (+, ) = {  h 3(m,c) : (  +)(  )  (0, )}

(2.4)

so w (+, ) is a real hypersurface in h 3(m,c).

2

fix some small, positive angle . for   h 3(m,c) write

(  +)(  ) = rei

where r  0 and   (, ]. then we say  lies in w (+, ) if r > 0 and  = 0. we say
that  lies on the positive side of w (+, ) if r > 0 and 0 <  < . we say that  lies
on the negative side of w (+, ) if r > 0 and  <  < 0. then, joyce argues that the

following kinds of transitions should occur. we are given a calabi-yau m with compact,
nonsingular three cycles n  in homology classes [n ] = . n  are taken to be special
lagrangian with phases . we assume n  intersect at one point p  m , with n +  n 
a positive intersection. as we deform the complex structure of m , the holomorphic three
form moves around in h 3(m,c) and therefore the phases  of n  change.

when [] is on the positive side of w (+, ) there exists a special lagrangian
threefold n which is dieomorphic to the connected sum n +#n , with [n ] = [n +]+[n ]
in h3(m, zz). n can be taken to be special lagrangian with phase  = 0 (this xes the
phase of  for us). as we deform [] through w (+, ), n converges to the singular
union n +  n . when [] is in w (+, ), the phases  align with  = 0. on the
negative side of w (+, ), n ceases to exist as a special lagrangian submanifold of m
(while  again become distinct).

for completeness and to establish some notation we will nd useful, we briey men-

tion some motivation for the existence of these transitions [10]. in joyces model of the

transition, there exists a manifold, d, with boundary s  n , which is special lagrangian

with phase i. if we call its volume a, this means that ia = rd . s denes a 2-chain in

n ; since we are assuming that h1(n, zz) is trivial, by poincare duality, s must be trivial

in homology. because s is real codimension one in n , it actually splits n into two parts:

n = c +  c , c + = s, c  = s.

so c   d dene 3-chains and in fact it turns out that

[c   d] =  = [n ]

we see that we can determine the volume of d just from knowledge of :

a =

1

i zd

 = zd

im() = z+

im()

(2.5)

(2.6)

using re()|d = 0 and im()|n = 0. but when [] goes through w (+, ), we see from
(2.6) and from the denition of w (+, ) that a becomes negative; at least in the local
model in c3, this means that n does not exist.

3

3. formerly bps states in iib string theory

now, consider type iib string theory compactied on m . when the complex structure
is such that [] is on the positive side of w (+, ), one can obtain a bps hypermultiplet

by wrapping a d3-brane on n . one can also obtain bps hypermultiplets by wrapping
d3-branes on n + or n .

because

[n ] = [n +] + [n ]

one can make a state carrying the same charges as the bps brane wrapping n by con-
sidering the two particle state with d3-branes wrapping both n + and n . how does the

energy of the two states compare?

recall that the disc d with boundary on n splits n into two components, c . dene

then if we let v denote the volume of n and v  denote the volumes of n , we recall:

b = zc



(3.1)

v = b+ + b

v ei

= b  ia

(3.2)

(3.3)

where a is the volume of d. since on this side of the transition a is positive, + is small
and positive while  is small and negative. in fact, reality of the volumes v  lets us solve
for  in terms of b yielding

 = 

a
b

(3.4)

the energy of the single particle state obtained by wrapping a d3-brane on n is

td3  v where td3 is the d3 brane tension. the energy of the (nonsupersymmetric) state
obtained by wrapping d3-branes on both n  can be approximated by td3  (v + + v ).
expanding (3.3) for small , we nd:

v + + v  = v + a (+  ) = v + a2 (

1
b+ +

1
b )

(3.5)

so since a > 0 and  > 0 on this side of the transition, we see that the single wrapped

brane on n is energetically preferred.

therefore, when the complex structure is on the positive side of w (+, ), the bps

state indeed has lower energy than the nonsupersymmetric two particle state carrying the
same charges, by roughly td3  a(+  ).

4

now as one moves in the complex structure moduli space of m through a point where
[] lies in w (+, ), a and  vanish. therefore, (3.5) shows that that mass of the two

particle state becomes equal to that of the single particle state: we are passing through

a locus of marginal stability. on this locus, the two particle state consisting of branes
wrapping n  is supersymmetric, since n  are special lagrangian with the same phase.

finally, move through to the region where [] lies on the negative side of w (+, ).
here,  < 0. since n ceases to exist as a supersymmetric cycle, the two particle
state with d3-branes wrapping n  is the lowest energy state carrying its charges.1 note
that the two particle state is nonsupersymmetric, since n  are special lagrangian with

dierent phases. here, we are making the conservative assumption that there is no stable,

nonsupersymmetric bound state of these two particles  such a bound state would be
reected in the existence of a (nonsupersymmetric) cycle in the homology class [n +]+[n ]
with lower volume than v + + v . this is tantamount to assuming that the force between

the two particles is repulsive for slightly negative a. this is reasonable since for a positive

there is an attractive force and a (supersymmetric) bound state, and as a decreases to

zero the magnitude of the force and the binding energy decrease until they vanish when

a = 0.

this phenomenon is an interesting variant on the examples of [12]. there, a stable

nonsupersymmetric state passes through a locus of marginal stability and becomes unstable

to decay to a pair of bps particles (which together break all of the supersymmetries). in

the present example, a bps particle becomes, as we move in complex structure moduli

space, unstable to decay to a pair of bps particles. moving slightly further in moduli

space, we see that the two bps particles together break all of the supersymmetries.

4. d6-branes and the fayet model

now, consider type iia string theory on the calabi-yau m in which the phenomena

of 2 are taking place. instead of studying particles in the resulting n = 2 supersymmetric

theory, we wrap the three-cycle n with a space-lling d6-brane (i.e., 3+1 of the dimensions

of the d6-brane ll the non-compact space). this yields an n = 1 supersymmetric theory

in the non-compact dimensions. for simplicity (since all our considerations are local), we

1 in a global model, even if there do exist other supersymmetric cycles in the same class, there
will be some region in moduli space close to the transition where the energy cost for moving to

them in the calabi-yau will be larger than the energy gained.

5

can assume m is non-compact so we do not have to worry about cancelling the d6 ramond-

ramond charge. alternatively, we could imagine the model discussed below arising as part

of a larger system of branes and/or orientifolds on m .

first, lets discuss the physics when [] is on the positive side of w (+, ). since

b1(n ) = 0, n has no moduli in m . therefore, there are no moduli in the eective 3+1

dimensional eld theory on the wrapped d6-brane. the u (1) gauge eld on the brane

survives reduction on n , so the 3+1 dimensional low energy eective theory has a u (1)

gauge symmetry. finally, because n is a supersymmetric cycle with h1(n, zz) trivial, there

is a unique supersymmetric ground state in the gauge theory (as opposed to a discrete set

of ground states parametrized by wilson lines around n ).

what about the physics when [] is on the negative side of w (+, )? the d6
which was wrapping n has now split into two d6-branes, wrapping n + and n . the
u (1) gauge eld on each survives, yielding a u (1)2 gauge theory. because n + and n  are

supersymmetric cycles with dierent phases, the theory has no supersymmetric ground

state. we do expect a stable nonsupersymmetric ground state, as long as [] is close
enough to w (+, ).

what is the physics associated with the phase transition when [] lies in w (+, )?
at this point, the two d6-branes wrapping n + and n  preserve the same supersymmetry,

and intersect at a point in m . because the light states are localized at the intersection, the

global geometry of the intersecting cycles doesnt matter and we can model the physics by

a pair of at special lagrangian three-planes intersecting at a point. this kind of system

was discussed in [13], and using their results it is easy to see that the resulting light strings
give rise to precisely one chiral multiplet with charges (+, ) under the u (1)2 gauge group

of the two wrapped d branes. therefore, one linear combination of the u (1)s (the normal

center of mass u (1)) remains free of charged matter, while the other (the relative

u (1)) gains a single charged chiral multiplet . the relative u (1) is therefore anomalous;

[13] demonstrates that the anomaly is cancelled by inow from the bulk.

ignoring the center of mass u (1) (which we identify with the surviving u (1) on the

positive side of w ), the physics of this model is precisely reproduced by the fayet model,

the simplest model of spontaneous (super)symmetry breaking [14]. this is a u (1) gauge

theory with a single charged chiral multiplet  (containing a complex scalar ). there is

no superpotential, but including a fayet-iliopoulos term rd in the spacetime lagrangian,

the potential energy is

v () =

1
g2 (||2  r)2

6

(4.1)

where g is the gauge coupling.

the phase structure of the model is quite simple: for r > 0, there is a unique su-

persymmetric minimum, and the u (1) gauge symmetry is higgsed. for r < 0, there is a

unique nonsupersymmetric minimum at  = 0, so the u (1) symmetry is unbroken. pre-

cisely when r = 0, there is a u (1) gauge theory with a massless charged chiral eld and a

supersymmetric ground state.

thus, we are led to identify the regions of positive, vanishing and negative r with
the positive side of w (+, ), the locus where [] is in w , and the negative side of w .

the single real modulus which varies in the transition experienced by the supersymmetric

three-cycle n can be identied with the fayet-iliopoulos parameter r. this identication is

consistent with the conjecture in [9] that in worldvolume gauge theories of a-type d-branes
on calabi-yau spaces, complex structure moduli only enter as d-terms.2

5. discussion

exploration of the phenomena involving supersymmetric cycles in a calabi-yau man-

ifold m under variation of the moduli of m has just started. it should be clear that as

such phenomena are understood, they will have interesting implications for the physics of

d-branes on calabi-yau spaces (for a nice discussion of various aspects of this, see [9]).

one of the most enticing possibilities is that as more such phenomena are uncovered,

we will nd new ways to geometrize the study of supersymmetry breaking models in

string theory. this would provide a complementary approach to attempts to write down

interesting nonsupersymmetric string models informed by ads/cft considerations [15] or

insights about tachyon condensation and nonsupersymmetric branes [16].

as a small step in this direction, it would be nice to nd ways of going over small

potential hills between dierent supersymmetric vacua of string theory. the transitions

studied here, when put in the more global context of a manifold m with (possibly) several

supersymmetric cycles in each homology class, might provide a way of doing this. for
instance in 4, as one moves [] into the negative side of w (+, ), it is clear that

one is increasing the scale of supersymmetry breaking (at least in the region close to the

transition). suppose that after one moves through the negative side of w in complex

2 note that the d6 branes in question here are considered a-type branes in the conventions of

[9] since the three non-compact spatial dimensions are ignored.

7

structure moduli space, eventually n + and n  approach each other and intersect again
and the phenomenon of 2 occurs in reverse, with a new supersymmetric cycle n  in the
same homology class as [n +] + [n ] popping into existence. in such a case, one would

have a nonsupersymmetric ground state for some range of parameters on the negative side

of w , and then eventually reach a supersymmetric ground state again (with the d6 brane
wrapping n ).

similarly, on the negative side of w there could exist elsewhere in m a supersym-
metric cycle n in the same class as [n +]+[n ]. although the cost in energy to move from
wrapping n to wrapping n is nonzero and hence on the negative side of w the phenomena
of 3, 4 occur, eventually it may become advantageous for the d6 branes to shift over to
wrapping n . this would again be a situation where supersymmetry is broken, and then
restored, as one dials the complex structure modulus of the calabi-yau space.
