(i) function f (j3) characterizes lie algebra given eq. (1). subsequent work, convenient dene function g(j3) follows: f (j3) g(j3) g(j3 1) . (3) example, so(3), f (j3) = 2j3 one gets g(j3) = j3(j3 + 1). easy check function g(j3) unique - periodic function unit period added maintaining eq. (3). note casimir operator lie algebra eq.

(ii) operators j+ j satisfy important property (j3)j+ = j+t (j3 + 1) , (j3)j = jt (j3 1) (5) analytic function (j3). property extensively used obtaining realizations. (iii) operators j+, j, j3 satisfy standard so(3) lie algebra, operators j+, j, j3 dened jm = pn mmnjn provided matrix satises = 1 det = +1. note elements matrix real, are, matrix orthogonal. property useful relating so(3) realizations currently available literature. (iv) given operators j1, j2, j3 satisfy so(3) lie algebra, one nd operators k1, k2, k3 satisfy general algebra  = iq3k3,  = iq1k1,  = iq2k2 , (6) choosing k1 = q2q3j1, k2 = q3q1j2, k3 = q1q2j3. particular k1 = ij1, k2 = ij2, k3 = j3 realization so(2, 1). (v) given operators j+, j, j3 satisfy standard so(3) lie algebra, one nd operators j+, j, j3 satisfy deformed algebra eq.

(7) chosen two conditions  = j trivially satised. order 3 satisfy third condition  = f ( j3), one needs functions a(j3, c), b(j3, c) satisfy following condition: a(j3 1, c)b(j3 1, c) b(j3, c)a(j3, c) = f (j3) . (8) a(j3, c) b(j3, c) commute, condition reduces h(j3, c) = g(j3) + p(j3) ; h(j3, c) a(j3, c)b(j3, c) , (9) p(j3) arbitrary periodic function period unity. important realize product h(j3, c) xed constraint equation, individual functions a(j3, c) b(j3, c). given eq. (7), sucient restrict attention realizations so(3) order obtain realizations deformed lie algebra three generators. note special case so(3) itself, choice p(j3) = c gives h(j3, c) = 1. simplest choice factors a(j3, c) = b(j3, c) = 1 reproduces initial so(3) realization, whereas general choice b(j3, c) = a1(j3, c) yields new realization. furthermore, choices p(j3) give additional new realizations so(3). particular, choice p(j3) = 0 gives realization j+ = j+ j3(j3 + 1) c j3(j3 + 1) , j = j , j3 = j3 , diers original one one generator j+. freedom choosing periodic function p(j3) analogous gauge xing eld theories. interesting nonlinear example using formalism comes choice g(j3) = 3 (j3 + 1)2 p(j3) = c 2. choice gives realization j 2 j+ = j+ , j = j , j3 = j3 , (10) deformed lie algebra corresponding f (j3) = 4j 3 3 . 3. realizations deformed lie algebra terms bosonic operators: section, develop procedure obtaining realizations lie algebra dened eq.

(12). formalism contains special cases coordinate realizations published literature. shall illustrate statement specic realizations discussed  . filho vaidya  discussed physical applications based following represen- tation so(2, 1): j+ = 2 d2 dy2 2 y2 , j = y2 8 , j3 = 2 dy 1 4 , (18) arbitrary constant. order obtain realization special case formalism, choose a, taking = 0, h(y) = 1/y2, r(y) = y2/4 eq. (25) appendix a. gives = y3 2 dy y2 4 , = 1 y2 , n = 2 dy 1 4 . furthermore, choosing p = , q = 1/a eq. (14), implies constraint (16) h(n ) reads h(n 1) h(n ) = 2n. solution h(n ) = n (n + 1) + , arbitrary constant. choosing factorization g(n ) = 1/8 f (n ) = 8h(n ), eq. (12) c = 0 = (3 4)/16 simplication gives filho-vaidya realization eq.
