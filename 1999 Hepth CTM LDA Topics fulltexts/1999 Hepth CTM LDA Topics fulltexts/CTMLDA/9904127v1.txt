abstract

in d - dimensional dilaton gravitational model with the central charge decit 
the generalized friedmann-type cosmological solutions (spatially homogeneous and
isotropic) are obtained and classied.

introduction

one of the consequences of the string theory in its low-energy limit is the scalar dilaton
eld (x) [1, 2] in the space-time with the (critical) dimension d. the dilaton was involved
in various gravitational models. in particular, it makes non-trivial the 1 + 1 - dimensional
(2d) gravity that has fruitfully progressed during the last ten years [3, 4, 5].

on the other hand the dilaton eld and other lowest-order corrections to einstein gravity
from the string theory were intensively used in cosmology [6]  [23]. some of the mentioned
authors [15]  [23] searched 3 + 1 - dimensional solutions with the friedmann-robertson-
walker metric keeping in mind some form of compactication of other d  4 dimensions.
the dilaton eld was recognized as a mechanism for the ination [24] that was required
for solving some cosmological problems.
in refs. [13, 16, 19, 21] the dilaton was used in
attempts to avoid the big bang singularity.

a. tseytlin [11] obtained a set of cosmological solutions for the maximally symmetric
space of an arbitrary dimension d with the dilaton, the central charge and the covariantly
constant antisymmetric tensor eld (for d = 3 or 4).

the latter approach is used in the present paper. we consider and classify cosmological
solutions in d - dimensional dilaton gravity with the central charge decit  for the case of
an arbitrary d. we use the d - dimensional generalization of frw metric corresponding to
homogeneous and isotropic spatial part with the constant curvature (k = 0, 1). all spatial
dimensions are equal as it may be before the compactication. the purpose of our studying
is to order the known 2d and higher d dilaton cosmological solutions (with adding new
ones) and to classify them exhaustively.

in this paper we dont consider the terms in the action with the antisymmetric tensor
elds so the condition of the maximal spatial symmetry restricts the possible dimensions
within d = 3 and d = 4. in these cases the problem was studied by many authors [6, 11,
17, 18, 20, 22].

1. model and equations

the dilaton gravitational model with the following action [1] is considered:

s = z q|g| e2(x)hr + 4()2 + i dn+1x.

(1)

here (x) is the scalar dilaton eld in n+1 - dimensional (d = n+1) pseudoriemann manifold
m1,n with coordinates x and the metric tensor g, g = det|g|, r is the scalar curvature,
()2 = g.
we use here and below the string frame for the action (1) keeping in mind that it may
be conformally transformed g  erg, r = 4/(d  2) to the einstein frame [1, 11, 14].

equations of evolution for this model

r  1

2(r + ) g + 2; = g h2;

are obtained from action (1) by the variation of the gravitational eld g and the dilaton
eld  accordingly. here r is the ricci tensor, ; is the covariant derivative.

transform the latter equations to the equivalent system

r + 2; = 0,
r + 4()2 = .

(2)

we search cosmological friedmanns type solutions of eqs. (2). it means that m1,n =
k is the homogeneous and isotropic manifold described by the scale factor a(t)
1 , pseudosphere
1 . the metric in

k has one of the following forms: n - dimensional sphere sn
0  rn. in the spherical (k = 1) case a is the radius of sn

k where sn

rsn
[11]. the manifold sn
sn
1, at space sn
m1,n = r  sn

k may be taken in the form [25]

k(x1)(dx2)2 + . . . + c2

k(x1)  c2

k(x2) . . .  c2

(3)

ds2 = dt2  a2(t)[(dx1)2 + c2
where ck(x) = 
cos x,
k = 1,
1,
k = 0,
cosh x, k = 1.


expressions (for all k):

we substitute the metric (3) and  = (t) into eqs. (2) taking into account the following

r0
0 = naa/a2, r1

1 = r2

2 = . . . = rn

n =  [aa + (n  1)( a2 + k)] /a2,

r = n [2aa + (n  1)( a2 + k)]/a2,

a = da/dt.

it reduces system (2) to three nontrivial equations

na/a + 2  = 0,

a  (n  1)( a2 + k)/a + 2 a  = 0,

n(n  1)( a2 + k)/a2 + 4 2  4n  a/a = .

(4)
(5)
(6)

these three equations are not independent. eq. (6) is the zero energy constraint that
is conserved as the consequence of eqs. (4) and (5) and hence gives only a restriction on the
initial values of a, a, ,

 [11].

and substitute it into eq. (6). the resulting second-order equation (it is quadratic one with
respect to a) may be transformed through the substitution

to classify all solutions of the latter equation and system (4)  (6) we consider some cases
separately.

in this case eq. (9) is homogeneous one. it may be integrated for all values of :

it results in the following evolution of the scale factor:

(11)

because all solutions of system (4)  (6) are invariant with respect to time translation (t0
is the constant of integration) and time reection. the signs  in eqs. (11) and (10) (the
latter is connected with the sign in eq. (9)) are independent.

the expression for  corresponding to (10) results from eq. (7)

(12)

the functions a(t) (10) and (t) (12) are exact solutions not only of eqs. (5) and (6) but
also of eq. (4). this situation is more general. it is the non-trivial fact connected with the
constraint character of eq. (6) that all solutions of eqs. (9) for all k,  and n satisfy eq. (4).

it is necessary to supplement the family (10), (12) by the linear dilaton solution [7, 21]

a = const,  = 0 

 t,

  0,

k = 0,

(13)

that was lost because of dividing on a in eq. (7).

the solutions (10), (12) are well known in the 4d or n = 3 case [16, 20, 21] and were
considered for  > 0 and an arbitrary d in ref. [11]. they coincide with the solutions
obtained by mueller [8] for the manifold rt n in the case when all radii of the n-dimensional
torus t n are equal. the solutions of veneziano [9] for the at manifold with dierent scale
factors generalize eqs. (10), (12).

one can see that qualitative picture of solutions (10), (12) and the structure of branches
are similar for all n > 1. in the cases   0 for all n we have two dierent branches of
solutions (or 4 branches if we take two symmetric with respect to the change + to  in
(11) solutions as dierent ones [16])1. and there are only one branch for  < 0 due to the
symmetry properties of (11).

the upper sign in eqs. (10) and (12) corresponds to an expansion (with increasing  )
of the at dilatonic universe from the singular point  = 0 with  growing up from ,
the opposite sign describes an evolution without the singularity a = 0 but with a  ,
  + at   0. the value  = 0 always corresponds to the power-law expressions for
a and  generalizing ones [16] for the case n = 3. the presence of  > 0 results in slowing
down the above mentioned expansion and stabilization of the scale factor: a  a0 = const,
in the case  < 0 we, v.v. have acceleration of evolution that is
   at   .
nished during nite time.

thus the described above role of -term in the dilaton cosmology is in some sense opposite
[11] to that in usual friedmann type n + 1 - dimensional cosmology. in the latter case the
evolution of the at universe (k = 0) with dust matter2 and with einsteins gravitational

lagrangian q|g| (r + 2) has the form [25]

a = const 




and  > 0 accelerates the expansion.

note that for the 2d dilaton model (n = 1) all cosmological solutions are exhausted
by eqs. (10)  (13). it is naturally so the 1 - dimensional space has no an intrinsic curvature,
hence k vanishes in eqs. (5), (6) if n = 1. in this case the n = 1 solution (10), (12) coincides
with the d = 2 string black hole solution [4, 12, 26] (taking the euclidean form after the
analytic continuation   ir,    [10]).
3. curved space k = 1 and  = 0

for any value of k all solutions of system (4)  (6) may be obtained by integrating eq. (9).
it was mentioned above that eq. (4) in this case is satised too. but the most convenient

1below for counting a number of the branches we dont dier two solutions connected only by the time
reversal (11). similarly, describing an expansion we always keep in mind that the corresponding solution with
the contraction exists. if one dier these solutions he should multiply any mentioned number of branches by
two.

2in action (1) all matter is in exotic (dilaton and -term) form.

way to classify various types of the solutions for  = 0 is to exclude the scale factor a from
eq. (4)  (6). for this purpose we take the linear combination of these equations with the
coecients 1, n/a and 1. the resulting expression

n(cid:16)2  
(cid:17)

(14)

a
a

(with  = 0) is integrable:

here c is an arbitrary constant.

an = ce2/ .

(15)

before using the expressions (14) or (15) we are to consider all solutions of system (4) 
(6) with  = 0. for all k, , n > 1 we have only two solutions of this type: the trivial case
of (13) a = a0,  = 0, k = 0,  = 0 and the solution with linear grows of a [11]

a = a0  t,  = 0,

k = 1,  = 0.

substituting eq. (14) or (15) into eq. (4) we obtain the dierential equation

introducing the notation

here the constants ca, 0 and c in eq. (15) are connected: ca = | cqe20|1/n.

expressions (20) - (22) satisfy eqs. (4)  (6) only under the following condition:

(nq/ca)2 = k sign (p  p1)  sign (p  p2).

(23)

it means that the solution (20) - (22) for the spherical case of k = 1 exist only if p  (p1, p2)
and for the case k = 1 it takes place if p  (, p1)  (p2, +).
so for k = 1,  = 0 there is only one branch of solutions (we count the branches in
accordance with the footnote in sect. 2) represented in fig. 1 as the evolution of the scale
factor a in time (11) for various n = d 1 (solid lines). the graphs for  = ( ) with 0 = 3
are drawn by the dashed lines for the cases n = 2 and n = 9. for any n these solutions
describe the expanding universe (a grows up from the singular value 0 to + and  rolls up
from  to + when p changes between the points (19) p1 and p2) during the nite time

here (x) is the euler gamma function. in fig. 1 the graphs a = a( ) and  = ( ) with
the equal values t = 1 for dierent n are drawn. note that the solutions (20) - (21) for any
xed n > 1 and k = 1 constitute the two-parameter family: the rst parameter t0 in (11)
is trivial (a translation in t), the second is ca, or q, or t (they are connected by eqs. (23)
and (24)). the third parameter 0 contains eq. (22).

in the pseudospherical case k = 1 the solutions (20) - (22) are divided into two branches
which are shown in fig. 2. the rst one (fig. 2a) describes the expansion of a and growing
: 0 < a < +,  <  < 0, p < p1. the second branch with p > p2 (fig. 2b)
corresponds to evolution of a without the singularity a = 0: the value a decreases from
+ to the minimum amin = ca[|n p1|p1(n p2)p2]1/4 and then it grows up to + when
 monotonically decreases from + to 0.
in these both cases the asymptotic   
behavior is   0 = const, a  const +  , i.e. in this limit all solutions (20) - (21) for k = 1
tend to the linear evolution (16).
in the opposite (singular) limit p  p1 or p  p2 for k = 1 and for all branches we

have an asymptotic dependence of the following two types:

a  const   1/n,
a  const  1/n,

e2  const  1+n,
e2  const  1n,

  +0,
  +0.

(25)
(26)

eq. (25) corresponds to the case p  p1 and a  0 that takes place for the branches
represented in figs. 1 (k = 1) and 2a (k = 1). the case (26) is realized for the solutions
in fig. 2b and in the limit t  t in fig. 1.
we see that the asymptotic behavior of the solutions (20) - (22) (k = 1,  = 0) and (10) -
(12) (k = 0) is identical. so one can easily set the correspondence between the equivalent
branches with the same limits (25) or (26).

there is only one3 dimension n = 4 (or d = 5) where an explicit solution (20) - (22)

exists:

3for the critical dimensions d = 10 or d = 26 the exponents in (20) are rational but this expression isnt

integrable through any eulers substitution.

here t = 8q/ 33 in accordance with (24),  = (t  t0) may be negative (unlike (11)).

expression (27) is rather simple and may illustrate the described above solution (20) -
(22). the constant t0 in eq. (27) is chosen so that the point  = 0 is the image of p = p2 = 2/3
and  = t is the image of p = p1 = 2 for the continuous mapping the p-axis onto  -axis.
so the points  = 0 and  = t divide the  -axis into 3 parts, and the interval 0 <  < t
corresponds to the case k = 1.

4. curved space k = 1 and  6= 0

in these cases we study various types of evolution a(t), (t) by solving the system (8),

(9) that may be rewritten as

a = q,

q = a1(cid:20)q2  k(n  1)  qqn[q2  k(n  1)] + a2(cid:21) .

(28)

to consider solutions of this system we use in this section, in particular, numerical

analysis so we have explicit solutions only in special cases.

for example, for the dimensionality n = 4 or d = 5 (specied in the previous section)
and  > 0 we obtained the exact particular solutions with the power-law evolution of the
scale factor

a = a0 ,

e220 =   ek  ,

a0 = 4q36/, n = 4, k = 1,  > 0.

for other values n the analogs of the solutions (29) also exist but the expressions

a  a0 ,

e220   (n2)/2  ek  ,

a2

0 = 2(n  1)/, k = 1,  > 0.

(29)

(30)

are only asymptotic at    [11]. in the opposite limit   0 these solution have the
asymptotic form (25) for k = 1 or (26) for k = 1.
well see below that the behavior of the mentioned solutions (29) and (30) in the t  
limit radically diers from that of all other solutions in the positive curvature case k = 1,
 > 0. otherwise, in the case k = 1,  > 0 all solutions have the asymptotic form (30).

analyzing the solutions of the system (28) we are to note that there is the domain

nq2 + a2  kn(n  1) < 0,

(31)

in the phase aq-plane where the radicand in (28) or (9) is negative. hence, the graphs of the
solutions in phase plane can not pass through the domain (31) and cross its border  the
2-nd order curve.

for k = 1 and an arbitrary xed value  the graph of an every solution of eqs. (28) in the
phase aq-plane contacts with the mentioned border of the domain (31), that is this border
(the ellipse if  > 0 or the hyperbola if  < 0) is the envelope of the graphs family. at the
contact point (we denote its coordinates a0, q0) for each solution the sign before the radical
in eq. (28) changes from  to +. so any graph of solution in the case k = 1 consists of
two parts corresponding to these signs and smoothly connected at the point (a0, q0).
in fig. 3 the graphs of the considered solutions with k = 1 in the ta-plane are represented
for the case n = 3 and various  (fig. 3a), and for the case n = 4 with xed value  = 1
(fig. 3b). the parameter t0 in eq. (11) is chosen so the value a = 0 corresponds to t = 0.
under these conditions the curves in fig. 3b are the one parameter family, and one may
choose the value a0 (if q0  0) as the parameter numerating the curves in the family. the

7

values a0 are shown near corresponding lines in fig. 3b. the curves marked by symbols 4
and 5 in fig. 3b correspond to the values q0 < 0 at the point of sign reversal in eq. (28);
these numbers are maximal values of the scale factor a for these solutions.

in fig. 3a for the case n = 3 the solutions a = a(t) with the same value a0 = 1 for various
values  (marked near the graphs) are shown. for the curve with  = 10 the value a = 1 is
the maximum of a. we see that presence of  < 0 accelerates the expansion in comparison
with the case  = 0 (fig. 1) and  > 0  decelerates. but with increasing  (without
exceeding the certain limit) the expansion remains irreversible  the values a and  grows
up to + during the nite time t (a0, ). the asymptotic behavior a(t) at t  t takes the
form (26) or

a  const  (t  t)1/n,

e2  const  (t  t)1n,

t  t.

(32)

if  reaches some critical value (depending on a0) the expansion becomes unlimited in time
with the power-law behavior (30) at t  . in fig. 3a (n = 3, a0 = 1) this critical value
slightly exceeds  = 2.732. for larger  the type of evolution changes  the expansion in
some time interval is replaced by compression that is nished in the nite time t = t (a0, )
with vanishing a. the value (t) during the time t grows from  up to some maximum
and then decreases to . in the limit t  t the asymptotic relation (25) takes place.
fig. 3b illustrates that the critical power-law solution (it takes the form (29) for n = 4)
may be obtained for xed value  > 0 by choosing the value a0. any small deviation from
the critical value results in an evolution within the framework of any of the two mentioned
types with nite lifetime t .

for the case of negative spatial curvature k = 1 and  < 0 each graph of solution in the
phase aq-plane contacts with the border of the forbidden domain (31) with the sign reversal
in eq. (28) (similarly to the case k = 1). the family of these graphs a = a(t) for xed n = 4,
 = 1 and various values a0 is shown in fig. 4a. the coordinates of the contact point a0
numerate the curves as in fig. 3b.
all the solutions with  < 0 (fig. 4a) have nite lifetimes t (a0, ) and the behavior (32).
but their behavior at t  0 depends on a0 and . if a0 does not exceed some critical value
a0 = acr() then a,   + at t  0 in accordance with (26) (similarly to the case  = 0
in fig. 2b). in the opposite case a0 > acr this limit is a, e2  0 (25) (compare with fig. 2a).
these two cases are divided by the solution with the critical value a0 = acr (fig. 4a) that is
close to the linear expansion (16) a  t,   0 for t  t .
in the case k = 1,  > 0 there is no real forbidden domain (31) but the solutions with
dierent signs in eq. (28) are connected by the time reversal t  t, q  q. so we have
one family of solutions with the innite lifetime and a   (28) asymptotic behavior at
t   [11], that is shown in fig. 4b for  = 1 and n = 0. the values q = a at the point
a = a0 = 1 numerate the curves. for values q < qcr(a0, ) (here qcr  1) the solutions have
the t  0 limit (26) and for q > qcr  the limit (25). the critical solution with q = qcr
(fig. 4b) has a  t,   0 dependence for small t.
conclusion

the friedmann type cosmological solutions in d - dimensional dilaton gravity with the
action (1) are investigated in this paper. dierent values of spatial curvature k = 0, 1
and various values  are considered. for all cases the solutions of the system (4)  (6)
(cosmological solutions) are described and classied. they include as the expressions (10) 
(12), (13), (16) (particular cases or generalizations of them were obtained in refs. [6]  [11]),
as new analytic solutions (20)  (22), (27), (29).

nite  the beginning and the end of the evolution are marked in table 1 by the mentioned
symbols (for k = 1 we have the critical solution with close to linear a   ,   0 beginning
of the expansion and the nite lifetime).
other symbols describing the end of an evolution in table 1 correspond to an innite
lifetime and power-law evolution within one of the following types: (30) (a   ), (13),
(10)  (12) (k = 0,   0), (16), (20)  (22) (k = 1, a   ).
for k = 1,  > 0 all solutions have the asymptotics a0 (30) [11], but for k = 1,
xed  > 0 and t0 only one critical solution (dividing dierent types of solutions) has such
a behavior.

note that the considered cosmological solutions have identical qualitative features for
various dimensionalities n  2 (n = 1 or d = 2 is reduced to the case k = 0). in this sense
the classication in table 1 is universal for all d.
