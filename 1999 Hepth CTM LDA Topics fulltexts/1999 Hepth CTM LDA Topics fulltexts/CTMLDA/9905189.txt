(2.1) coecient functions pij(t), qij(t), rij(t), si(t) i, j = 1, 2, . . . , smooth functions time t, understood repeated indices summed unless otherwise stated. take pij(t) rij(t) symmetric matrix, p (t) = p (t), rt (t) = r(t), assume p (t) positive-denite, i.e., minors positive . equations motion derived action read xx + ss = 00 , used matrix-valued operator, := dt(cid:18)p (t) dt + qt (t)(cid:19) +(cid:18)q(t) dt + r(t)(cid:19) . (2.2) (2.3) note operator self-adjoint space functions vanish time boundary = 0 . shall consider dirichlet problem associated equation (2.2), is, look solution xx(t) (2.2) satisfying boundary conditions, xx(0) = aa, xx(t ) = bb, (2.4) 4 given vectors aa, bb ri d. usual procedure choose rst two independent sets solutions, {vvk(t)} {uuk(t)} k = 1, 2, . . . , d, obey homogeneous (jacobi) equation, vvk = 00, uuk = 00, k = 1, 2, . . . , . (2.5) set {vvk} specied requiring vi k(0) = ik, vi k(0) = 0, i, k = 1, 2, . . . , . hand, {uk} impose conditions, ui k(0) = 0, i, k = 1, 2, . . . , , (2.6) (2.7) moment leave ui k(0) undetermined. solutions form complete set solutions homogeneous equation.2 later, shall impose conditions specify set uniquely. also choose special solution ss(t) full equations motion (2.2), ss +ss = 0, obeying initial condition si(0) = 0. (for present purpose need specify initial velocities sj(0).) then, terms 2d constants, ak, bk k = 1, 2, . . . , d, general solution equations motion (2.2) given xx(t) = ak uuk(t) + bk vvk(t) + ss(t) . (2.8) convenience, introduce matrices u (t) v (t) solutions uik(t) := k(t) vik(t) := vi ui k(t), respectively, thereby rewrite general solution (2.8) xx(t) = u (t) aa + v (t) bb + ss(t) , (2.9) aa = (a1, . . . , ad)t bb = (b1, . . . , bd)t . initial condition (2.4) implies bb = aa whereas nal condition (2.4) met choosing aa = u 1(t ) (bb v (t ) aa ss(t )) . (2.10) thus clear solution dirichlet problem (2.4) exist det u (t ) = 0, cause caustics. 2 note boundary conditions, (2.6) (2.7), dier slightly used ref.. 5 formulate caustics precisely, let us dene f f becomes rank matrix u (t ), choose (new) set solutions {uuk} satisfying uuk(t ) = 00 k = 1, 2, . . . , f. (2.11) also demand, simplicity, non-vanishing part solutions set normalized ui k(t ) = ik i, k = f + 1, f + 2, . . . , . (2.12) hence, = matrix u (t ) takes form, u (t ) =(cid:18) 0 0 1(cid:19) . (2.13) upper left 0 f f null matrix, lower left 0 (d f ) f null matrix, 1 (d f ) (d f ) identity matrix, represents f (d f ) matrix consisting undetermined elements. shall see shortly, number f gives co-dimension surface caustics occur, f = f = 0 two extremes. call extreme cases full caustics non-caustics, respectively, use partial caustics intermediate cases. note choice, (2.11) (2.12), always realized linear transforma- tions solution space formed {uuk} exchanges coordinates, necessary. follows solution (2.8) surface caustics (i.e., set endpoints) conjugate initial point given xx = uuk(t )ak + hh(aa) , (2.14) ak, k = f + 1, . . . , d, parameterize (d f )-dimensional caustic surface, used hh(aa) := vvk(t )ak + ss(t ) . (2.15) thus, f 6= 0, dirichlet problem best (in coordinate frame) nd solution meets conditions xi(t ) = bi = f + 1, . . . , choosing ak = ak(bb) := bk hk(aa) k = f + 1, f + 2, . . . , d.

(strictly speaking, space quite orthogonal surface u (t ) may symmetric.) terms projec- tion operators endpoint classical solution (2.18) xx(t ) = u (t ) bb + u (t ) hh(aa), (2.19) geometrical meaning evident (fig.1). 7 derive useful identities important later. notice rst that, arbitrary vector-valued functions ff gg, z 0 dt (ff gg gg ff ) =h(cid:16) ff p gg gg p ff(cid:17) + ff (cid:0)q qt(cid:1) ggit 0 , (2.20) used inner product aa bb = aibi. solutions ff = uuk, gg = vvl jacobi equation (2.5), boundary conditions, choose functions (2.6), (2.7), (2.11) (2.12), nd matrix form relations (2.20) become v (t )p (t ) u (t ) v (t )p (t )u (t ) +v (t )(cid:8)qt (t )q(t )(cid:9)u (t ) = p (0) u (0) . (2.21) may also choose ff = uuk gg = uul get u (t )p (t ) u (t ) u (t )p (t )u (t ) + u (t )(cid:8)qt (t ) q(t )(cid:9)u (t ) = 0 . particular, l > f k f (lk)-component identities (2.22) reads (2.22) uul(t ) p (t ) uuk(t ) = 0 . (2.23) non-caustics case one u (t ) = 1, one eliminate q(t ) identity (2.21) using (2.22) nd n v (t ) + v (t ) u (t )o p (t ) = p (0) u (0) . (2.24) let us recall general denition jacobi elds. denote xx(pp, t) classical solution xx(pp, 0) = aa, = pp , (2.25) l xx (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0 given aa, pp ri d. jacobi elds given jik(t) := xi(p, t) pk .

(2.29) particular, non-caustics case identity (2.24) used simplify (2.29) x = 1 2np (0) u (0) +h v (t ) + v (t ) u (t )i p (t )o = p (0) u (0) . using (2.30) (2.27), one immediately conrm relation, j(t ) x = x j(t ) = 1, follows general denition (2.25). (2.30) (2.31) 2.2. quantum caustics move quantum mechanics consider problem corresponding classical dirichlet problem (2.4), is, wish nd transition kernel k(bb, ; aa, 0) whose path-integral expression k(bb, ; aa, 0) =z xx(t )=bb xx(0)=aa dxx e h i . 9 (2.32) end, one-dimensional case, rst decompose path xx(t) boundary values (2.4) xx(t) = xx(t) + (t) + (t) .

(2.40) f yi=1 thus, let m(t ) morse index operator (associated period ) gives number non-positive modes n 0 (2.35), combine (2.40) (2.34), get kernel polar form, k(bb, ; aa, 0) = r(t ) f yi=1 (cid:16)(cid:2)u (t )(bb hh(aa))(cid:3)i(cid:17) ei(bb,t ;aa,0) . phase part given (bb, ; aa, 0) := 1 h i 2 m(t ) + , (2.41) (2.42) constant independent , replaced i i presence delta-functions (2.41). result (2.41) shows that, caustics occur, allowed transitions satisfying (t ) = 00, is, whose boundaries admit classical solutions. words, classically forbidden processes remain forbidden even quantum mechanically. key ingredient determining modulus part r(t ) kernel (2.41) unitarity relation, yi=1 (ai ci) =z yi=1 dbi k (bb, ; cc, 0) k(bb, ; aa, 0) .
