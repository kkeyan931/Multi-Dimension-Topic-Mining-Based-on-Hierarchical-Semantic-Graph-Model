microscopic and bulk spectra of dirac
operators from finite-volume partition

functions

the microscopic spectrum of the qcd dirac operator is shown to obey random
matrix model statistics in the bulk region of the spectrum close to the origin using
nite-volume partition functions.

1 introduction

the spectral density () of the dirac operator in qcd contains interesting
informations as it is for example directly proportional to the chiral condensate
 at the origin through the banks-casher relation 1. while the full spectrum
is only accessible numerically in qcd on the lattice many analytic results for
parts of the spectrum have been obtained during the past years using random
matrix theory (rmt), chiral perturbation theory and nite-volume partition
functions (for a recent review see 2). within these results two dierent regimes
have been investigated: (i) unscaled macroscopic correlations and (ii) micro-
scopic correlations between eigenvalues rescaled by the mean spectral density.
in the region (ii) one furthermore has to distinguish between scaling at the
origin and in the bulk of the spectrum. in the macroscopic regime (i) the slope
of the spectral density at the origin

has been calculated by smilga and stern 3 for fundamental su (nc  3)
fermions ( = 2) and very recently by toublan and verbaarschot 4 for funda-
mental su (2) fermions ( = 1) and adjoint fermions ( = 4) with any gauge
group. here f denotes the pion decay constant.
coming to the rescaled correlations (ii) at the origin all higher order cor-
relation functions of scaled eigenvalues x = /v are known. they are
given analytically as functions of the chiral condensate  and scaled sea-quark
masses f = mf /v (for details see 2). this description holds in the limit
of leutwyler and smilga 5 1/qcd  v 1/4  1/m, where m is the pion
mass, up to a certain scale t h  v 1/2 called thouless energy 6 in analogy to
disordered systems. within this region the analytic description provides an

exact nonperturbative limit of qcd, dealing, however, with an unphysically
heavy pion that does not t into the nite-volume of the system.
away from the origin much less is known about correlations on the micro-
scopic scale. up to now it has been found only empirically that also there
correlations follow a (non-chiral) rmt description 7,8. the aim of the results
presented here is to understand analytically why this is possible. therefore,
the correlation functions are expressed in terms of nite-volume partition func-
tions 9 and explored in the bulk region but still in the vicinity of the origin.
the region of validity is therefore given by the one of nite-volume partition
functions. it does not hold all the way up to the unphysical turn-over in the
spectrum (dotted line in fig. 1) which is due to cut-o and nite-size eects
on the lattice. this intermediate region remains unexplained so far.

2 correlation functions from nite-volume partition functions

before taking the bulk limit we have to recall how the correlators can be ex-
pressed using the leutwyler and smilga partition functions in the microscopic
limit at the origin. the generation function for the correlators is the kernel of
orthogonal polynomials. for gauge group su (nc  3) with fermions in the
fundamental representation it is given by 9

where z (nf )



is the partition function of nf avors with rescaled masses f ,

relation functions can then be obtained as

this description is equivalent to a unitary chiral rmt description ( = 2).
since we want to go to the bulk of the spectrum we should expect that the
chiral properties no longer play a role for the correlations. we will nd that
this is indeed the case even in the vicinity of the origin. it is therefore in-
structive to compare to 3-dimensional qcd with avor symmetry breaking,
which is described by non-chiral rmt 10. the corresponding kernel can be
written in the same way as in eq. (2) 9 after dropping the prefactor cxy,
where the product now runs over nf /2 avors occurring in pairs f . the
corresponding partition function reads

z (nf )({}) = det(cid:18) a({f}) a({f})

a({f}) a({f}) (cid:19) ({})1, aij = (i)j1ei . (5)

3 the bulk limit

in rmt it is known for massless avors how to invert the origin scaling
limit where v  ,   0 and x = /v is kept xed:

korigin(x, y) = kbulk(x, y) = c sin(x  y)

x  y

.

(6)

lim

x  y = o(1)

it takes us from the bessel-kernel at the origin (eq. (2) for mf = 0) to the
sine-kernel in the bulk. we will see in the following that the same result holds
including the masses. in rmt the translational invariance of the spectrum
then implies that the sine-kernel holds everywhere in the bulk. since we
cannot make such a strong statement about the qcd dirac spectrum we will
be restricted to the domain of validity of nite-volume partition functions.
in taking the bulk limit of the full kernel eq. (2) we also have to scale back
all masses f   at the same time since they would otherwise drop out

expanding the prefactor around one of the arguments it is unity up to higher
orders and thus we nd the same result as in the massless case eq. (6). taking
the same limit of the non-chiral theory eqs. (2),(5) we obtain precisely the
same result and thus nd, that the chiral properties are lost in the bulk even
in the vicinity of the origin. another consequence is that in the bulk any mass
scale given by the sea-quarks drops out on the microscopic scale.
in ref. 8 it has been stated that the thouless energy scale at the origin is
larger or equal to the one in the bulk. looking at the bulk but close to the
origin it is clear that if we take 1 < t h and 2 > t h we are outside the
domain of validity although it may still be |1  2| < t h.
