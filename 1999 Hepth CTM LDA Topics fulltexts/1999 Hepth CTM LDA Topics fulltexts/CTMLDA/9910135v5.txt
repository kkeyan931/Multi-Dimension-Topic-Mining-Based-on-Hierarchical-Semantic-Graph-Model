physics department, university of seoul, seoul 130-743, korea

a deformed nahm equation for the bps equation in the noncommutative n=4 super-

symmetric u(2) yang-mills theory is obtained. using this, we constructed explicitly

a monopole solution of the noncommutative bps equation to the linear order of the

noncommutativity scale. we found that the leading order correction to the ordinary

su(2) monopole lies solely in the overall u(1) sector and that the overall u(1) magnetic

eld has an expected long range component of magnetic dipole moment.

as shown recently, quantum eld theories in noncommutative spacetime naturally arise
as a decoupling limit of the worldvolume dynamics of d-branes in a constant ns-ns two-form
background[1]. but detailed dynamical eects due to the noncommutative geometry are still par-
tially understood[1, 2, 3, 4].

in this note, we shall exploit the n=4 supersymmetric gauge theories on noncommutative r4
that is the worldvolume theory of d3-branes in the ns-ns two-form background. this theory was
recently investigated to study the nature of monopoles and dyons in the noncommutative space[5].
the energy and charge of monopoles satisfying the noncommutative bps equations were identied
and shown to agree those of ordinary monopoles. below, we shall concentrate on the construction
of a self-dual monopole solution of the theory by generalizing adhmn methods[6, 7, 8, 9] to the
noncommutative case.

we begin with the noncommutative n=4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. we shall restrict
our discussion to the case of u (2) gauge group. among the six higgs elds, only a higgs eld 
plays a role in the following discussions of a monopole. the bosonic part of the action is given by

s = 

1
4g2

ym z d4x tr(cid:16)f  f   2d  d(cid:17),

where the -product is dened by

i
2   

 a(x)b(x)(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=x

that respects the associativity of the product. we shall assume in the following that 0i = 0i = 0.
then without loss of generality, one may take the only nonvanishing components to be 12 = 21 
. f and d are dened respectively by

f  a  a + i(a  a  a  a)
d   + i(a      a)

as argued in ref. [5], the charge is to be quantized at integer values even in the noncommutative
case. this is because the elds in the asymptotic region are slowly varying and, hence, the standard
argument of the topological quantization of the magnetic charge holds in the noncommutative
theory. the main aim of this note is to investigate the detailed form of one self-dual monopole
solution in the noncommutative case.

before proceeding we show rst the fact that a noncommutative monopole solution inevitably
involves nonvanishing overall u (1) parts. to prove this, let us note the solution for the monopole
with  = 0 is given by2

ai = ijkxjk 1

2r (cid:18)coth r 
2r2 (cid:18) r

r(cid:19)

we then expand the solution of the noncommutative bps equation with respect to  by

 =  + (1) + 2(2)   
a = a + a(1) + 2a(2)    .

the leading corrections to di and bi are, respectively,

(bi)(1) = ijk(cid:16)i( aj  ak   aj ak) + j(a(1))k + i[ aj, (a(1))k](cid:17)
(di)(1) = i( ai    ai    ai +   ai)+i(1) +i[(a(1))i, ]+i[ ai, (1)] ,

where  and  denote derivative with respect to x+iy and xiy. the terms in the rst parentheses
follow from the evaluation of the -product of the ordinary monopole solution and can be explicitly
computed. they are

iijk(cid:16)( aj  ak   aj ak)(cid:17) =

2r (cid:16)(r2w2)3i + (w2)x3xi(cid:17) i22

i( ai     ai      ai    ai) =

nents only and the two are dierent from each other. hence to satisfy the bogomolnyi equation,
there should be overall u (1) contributions in (1) or a(1) to cancel the dierence because the su (2)
parts of (1) and a(1) do not produce u (1) components of the eld strengths in this leading order.

we now establish the nahms formalism in the noncommutative case to solve the bps equa-
tion. the basic idea is simply to replace all the ordinary product of the standard derivation
by -product. this fact was briey argued already in ref. [5], but the deformed nahm equa-
tion below was not found. to obtain the self-dual monopole solution, nahm adapted the adhm
construction[10] of instanton3 to solve the self-dual yang-mills equation in euclidean four space
such that the gauge elds are translationally invariant in the x4-direction. here we shall begin
with reviewing adhmn construction[6, 7, 8, 9] to follow the similar line of logic. the adhmn
construction of k monopole starts with a matrix operator,

 = 

d
d

ikk  i22 + ikk  ixi + ti  i ,

(16)

2in the following, we shall set gym = 1 and u = 1.
3see also ref.[11] for the adhm construction of noncommutative instanton solutions.

where tis are k  k matrices. the following two conditions are required on ;

[, ikk  i] = 0 ,  :

invertible .

we then solve the equation

with a normalization condition

v = 0 ,

where v is a 2k  2k matrix. the gauge elds are given by

where the indices run from 1 to 4, we identify a4 with , i.e. fi4 = di, and i
im4n + in4m is the self-dual t hooft tensor.

mn = imn4 

in the noncommutative case, the derivation goes through once all the product operations are
replaced by -product operations. namely, the matrix operator (16) remains the same while the
conditions become

[  , ikk  i] = 0 ,    :

invertible .

we have to solve

with a normalization condition

  v = 0 ,

the gauge elds are now given by

these potentials then satisfy the noncommutative bps equation. namely, the eld strength is the
one obtained from (21) by replacing all the ordinary product operations with -product operations,
so the expression is manifestly self-dual.

let us now work out the conditions in (17). the operator    reads

the two conditions demand that tis are hermitian matrices and that

d
d

ti = iijktjtk  3iikk .

(27)

this equation is nothing but the nahm equation for the ordinary yang-mills theory if  is set to
zero. this deformed nahm equation can be reduced to the ordinary nahm equation

d
d

ti = iijk tj tk .

(28)

introducing ti by ti = ti i3ikk. the boundary conditions at  = 1/2 for the nahm equation
(28) are not to be changed from those of ordinary monopoles even for the noncommutative case
because they correspond to the long range eects and the noncommutativity plays no role. hence
the boundary conditions are that tis have simple poles at the boundaries and the residues form
an irreducible representation of su (2). the ordinary nahm equation is naturally interpreted
as describing supersymmetric ground states for the worldvolume theory of suspended d-strings
between d3-branes[12]. in this context, the modication  i3ikk implies that the d-strings are
slanted with a slope  where  is identied with a spatial coordinate of the d-string worldvolume.
the emerging picture is quite consistent with the direct analysis of a d1-brane in the ns-ns two-
form background where the same slope appears[5]. although interesting, we wont exploit the
relationship further here.

we now turn to the problem of the construction of actual solutions of the bps equation.
we try the case of k = 1, i.e. one monopole. the deformed nahm equation is solved trivially by
ti =  3i  ci, where cis are constants related to the monopole position. we shall set ci to zero
by invoking the translational invariance of the noncommutative yang-mills theory.

the equation (23) is explicitly

where we dene o by

this equation is equivalent to 3-dimensional dirac equation with time dependent mass in the
background magnetic eld 4. the solution with  = 0 is simply

v (, r) = er k(r) ,

(31)

where k(r) = (cid:0)

sinh r(cid:1)1/2 is determined by the normalization condition, (19). one may solve the

it is then straightforward to evaluate (1) and a(1) using (25); they are

(35)

(36)

in this order, there is no correction to the higgs eld, which provides the higher dimensional
geometric picture of monopole as a d-string suspended between two d3-branes. finally, using
(12)-(13), the leading corrections to the magnetic eld and d are found to be

b(1) = (d)(1) = (cid:18)

1
r

(r2g)e3 + gx3r(cid:19) i22 ,

(37)

4r3

where g = (s1)
. a few comments are in order. first, the self duality to this order is manifest in
the above as it should be. as proved earlier, there are nonvanishing overall u (1) components in the
gauge connection. furthermore, all the leading order corrections lie in the overall u (1) sector. the
solution in (35)-(36) is rather unique up to zero-mode and gauge uctuations that may be shown
to agree with those of ordinary su(2) monopole to o(). note that the translational zero modes of
a monopole are already xed by setting ci to zero. the gauge elds, higgs eld and eld strengths
are nonsingular everywhere to this order. especially, the magnetic eld at the origin behaves

b = (cid:16) 1

36

e3 + o(r2)(cid:17)i22 .

(38)

we see here constant u(1) magnetic eld is induced at the origin. in the asymptotic region, the
correction behaves as5

b = 

e3 + 3(e3 r)r

4r3

i22 + 

e3  2(e3 r)r

2r4

i22 + exponential corrections .

(39)

this long range eld does not contribute to the magnetic charge in (7) and, thus, we explicitly
see that the magnetic charge remains at integer values. the leading overall u(1) correction is the
expected magnetic dipole contribution of the form, p+3(pr)r
4 e3i22; as discussed
below (28),  
2 e3 are the end-point displacements of the d-string from the positions of  = 0, and
the u(1) magnetic charges with a proper normalization are  1
2 on the branes, so p agrees with

, with p = 

r3

5the dipole term in this expression was rst obtained in ref. [14].

the charges multiplied by the displacements. the subleading long range term is not in the form of
quadrupole moment and its physical origin is not clear.

there are many directions to go further. in the large  limit, the structure of the equation
(29) seems simplied and this may be helpful in understanding the nature of large  limit by nding
details. as said earlier, one may equivalently describe the noncommutative supersymmetric yang-
mills theory by the ordinary dirac-born-infeld theory with a magnetic eld background[1, 15, 16,
17, 18]. understanding this relation was originally one of the main purpose of this note, but no
progress is made in this direction.

our analysis is expected to be directly generalized to the cases of dyons and 1/4 bps dyons.
in addition, the leading eect of noncommutativity to the moduli dynamics of monopoles and 1/4
bps dyons will be of interest.
