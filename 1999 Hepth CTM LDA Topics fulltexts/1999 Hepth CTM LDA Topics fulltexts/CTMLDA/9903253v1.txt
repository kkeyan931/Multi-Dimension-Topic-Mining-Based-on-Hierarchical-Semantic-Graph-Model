abstract

a singular conguration of external static magnetic eld in the

form of a pointlike vortex polarizes the vacuum of quantized massless

spinor eld in 2+1-dimensional space-time. this results in an analogue

of the bohm-aharonov eect: the chiral symmetry breaking conden-

sate, energy density and current emerge in the vacuum even in the

case when the spatial region of nonvanishing external eld strength is

excluded. the dependence of the vacuum characteristics both on the

value of the vortex ux and on the choice of the boundary condition

at the location of the vortex is determined.

the dynamical breakdown of chiral symmetry is a topic of persisting

interest for a long time (for reviews see, e.g., refs.[1, 2, 3, 4]). an important

role in its study is played by the appropriate order parameter  vacuum

condensate

c(x, t) = ihvac|t (x, t)(x, t)|vaci.

(1)

in the background of external classical elds, the vacuum expectation value

of the time-ordered product of the fermion eld operators takes the form

hvac|t (x, t) (x, t)|vaci = ihx, t|(i + m)1|x, ti,

(2)

where  is the covariant derivative in this background. thus, in a static

background, condensate (1) is reduced to the form

where

c(x) = 

1

trhx|0 sgn(h)|xi,

h = i0jj + 0m,

(3)

(4)

is the pertinent dirac hamiltonian and

sgn(u) = 


1,

u > 0

1, u < 0

.




for a certain background eld (magnetic or gravitational) conguration, the

analysis of eq.(1) (or its particular form, eq.(3)) can be carried out with a

special attention to the limiting procedure m  0. if the condensate survives

in this limit, then it witnesses chiral symmetry breaking by this conguration.

moreover, as it has been shown in ref.[5], in the case of quantized spinor

elds in the background of a homogeneous magnetic eld in 2+1-dimensional

space-time, the chiral symmetry breaking condensate emerges irrespectively

of all other possible types of interaction among quantized spinor elds. the

question that we would like to address in the present letter is, whether the

emergence of the chiral symmetry breaking condensate could be caused by

nontrivial topology of the base space manifold?

nontrivial topology can be achieved, formally, by excluding submanifolds

of less dimensions from an initial manifold with trivial topology. for ex-

ample, deleting a line from a three-dimensional space results in the spatial

topology becoming nontrivial with the classication in terms of the winding

number: 1 = z (here 1 is the rst homotopy group and z is the set of

integer numbers). imposing various boundary conditions at the location of

the excluded submanifold, one can study a possibility that some of them

will induce the chiral symmetry breaking condensate in the vacuum. how-

ever, our freedom to vary boundary conditions is restricted by the natural

requirement of their physical meaningfulness. since we are not to consider

here boundary conditions invoking instability and conne ourselves to sta-

tionary problems, self-adjointness of the hamiltonian has to be maintained.

it is well known that the free dirac hamiltonian is essentially self-adjoint

when dened on the domain of regular functions (see, e.g., ref.[6]). thus,

3

we have no choice but to pick the regularity boundary condition in order

to ensure self-adjointness, and this yields no gain comparing to the case of

trivial topology. one has to do something more, than simply saying about

the deletion of a line from a space, in order to achieve nontrivial topology

physically. and this doing more means inserting a singular magnetic vortex

at the location of the deleted line. then the dirac hamiltonian dened on

the domain of regular functions is not self-adjoint any more, which may seem

from the rst sight to be rather forbidding. however, this obstruction can be

overcome by exploring a possibility of self-adjoint extension along the lines of

the weyl-von neumann theory of self-adjoint operators (see, e.g., refs.[7, 8]).

as a result, one arrives at a set of boundary conditions which are compatible

with self-adjointness and allow for wave functions being square-integrable

but irregular at the location of a deleted line. we shall show that these

boundary conditions can induce the chiral symmetry breaking condensate in

the vacuum.

omitting the spatial dimension along a deleted line, one gets a two-

dimensional space (plane) with a deleted point (puncture). a static singular

magnetic vortex inserted at the puncture is given by the ehrenberg-siday-

aharonov-bohm potential [9, 10]

v 1 = 

x2

(x1)2 + (x2)2 ,

v 2 = 

x1

(x1)2 + (x2)2 ,

(5)

where  is the vortex ux in 2 units (conventions  = c = 1 are implied)

and the location of the puncture is taken as the origin of the carthesian

coordinates x1 and x2 on the plane. specifying the covariant derivative as

4

j = j + ivj,

j = 1, 2,

(6)

our aim is to study the polarization of the fermionic vacuum by classical

static background (5) in 2+1-dimensional space-time.

as it is known (see, e.g., ref.[11]), in order to consider the chiral symmetry

breaking in 2+1 dimensions, quantized spinor elds have to be assigned to

the reducible representation of the cliord algebra

 = 


+




 ,

(7)

where + and  are assigned to two inequivalent irreducible (2  2) repre-

sentations;  matrices are chosen in the form

0 =

0

0 3


 ,

1 = 


i1

0

0 i1


 ,

2 =

0 i2


 , (8)

where 1, 2 and 3 are the pauli matrices. the algebra is completed by

adding the  matrix corresponding to the missing dimension,

and the 5 matrix is

3 = i


0 i

i 0


 ,

5  i0123 = i

 .

(9)

(10)

then the massless dirac hamiltonian (eq.(4) at m = 0) in background (5)

takes the form

(12)

where

h = 


r = p(x1)2 + (x2)2 and  = arctan(x2/x1) are the polar coordinates. a

single-valued solution to the stationary dirac equation

(13)

with hamiltonian (11)(12) is presented as

decomposing the value of the vortex ux into the integer and fractional

parts,

 = [[]] + {|  |},

0  {|  |} < 1

(15)

([[u]] denotes the integer part of quantity u), one can note that the case of

{|  |} = 0 is equivalent to the case of trivial topology, i.e. absence of the

vortex ( = 0).1) in the case of 0 < {|  |} < 1 the modes with n 6= [[]]

1)this conrms once more the general fact that a singular magnetic vortex is physically

unobservbale at integer values of the vortex ux [10].

it was as far back as 1931 that

dirac used actually this fact to obtain his famous condition for the magnetic monopole

quantization [12].

obey the condition of regularity at the puncture r = 0: the corresponding

partial hamiltonians are essentially self-adjoint when dened on the domain

of regular functions. that is only the partial hamiltonian corresponding to

n = [[]], that needs a self-adjoint extension. similarly to the case of nonzero

fermion mass (m 6= 0) [13, 14, 15], it can be shown that the self-adjoint

extension is parametrized by one real continuous variable , yielding the

following condition for the mode with n = [[]]:

(16)

where  > 0 is the parameter of the dimension of inverse length, which

is introduced just to scale the dierent irregular behaviour of the f and g

components; note that, since eq.(16) is periodic in  with period 2, all

permissible values of  can be restricted, without a loss of generality, to

range     .

the minus/plus sign factor in the right-hand side of eq.(16) deserves

a special comment. for a massless fermion in an irreducible representation,

an overall change of sign before the pauli matrices does not mean a transi-

tion to an inequivalent representation, because 3 by itself does not appear

anywhere, while a change of sign before 1 and 2 corresponds to a transi-

tion to an equivalent representation. this is reected by the fact that the

expressions for h+ and h coincide, see eq.(12). thus, boundary condition

(16) is the only point where a distinction between + and  arises. unless

we had made this distinction, we would get the case of a reducible repre-

sentation composed of two equivalent irreducible ones, which simply doubles

the case of an irreducible representation considered in detail elsewhere [16]:

7

the condensate and the corresponding mass term break parity rather than

chiral symmetry in that case. on the contrary, boundary condition (16) is

invariant under parity transformation

hx1, x2|ei  i13hx1, x2|ei

and is not invariant under chiral transformation

hx1, x2|ei  5hx1, x2|ei,

unless

cos  = 0,

(17)

(18)

(19)

when both parity and chiral symmetry are maintained.

having specied the boundary condition at the puncture r = 0, an ex-

plicit form of a solution to eq.(13) can be obtained. using this form, all

vacuum polarization eects are determined. in addition to condensate (3),

also current

the use of a certain regularization and renormalization procedure to get rid of

both ultraviolet and infrared divergences, for details see ref.[16]. concerning

eq.(20), we can add that the radial component of the vacuum current,

since the puncture breaks translational invariance on the plane, the vac-

uum polarization eects (23)  (25) are not translationally invariant. there

remains an invariance with respect to rotations around the puncture, and,

9

therefore, the vacuum polarization eects depend only on the distance from

the puncture. at large distances they are decreasing by power law:

thus, the total vacuum condensate is innite at half-integer values of the

vortex ux, unless eq.(19) holds.

finally, few comments on the case of absence of the condensate in the

vacuum, i.e., when eq.(19) holds. in this case two of the four components

of the wave function (14) become regular for all n:

g
n components are regular, and, if  =  

2 , then the f 

if  = 

2 , then the
n components are

regular. due to this, scale symmetry, as well as parity and chiral symmetry,

is maintained. the nontrivial topology reveals itself in the emergence of the

vacuum current and energy density only:

(36)

summarizing, we have completed an exhaustive study of vacuum polariza-

tion eects in the background of a singular magnetic vortex ({|  |} 6= 0) under

boundary condition (16) which ensures self-adjointness of the hamiltonian

and parity conservation. if  6=  

2 , then chiral symmetry breaking conden-
sate (23) emerges in the vacuum. one would anticipate that scale symmetry

11

is broken as well, but this is not the case. note that the vacuum current

and energy density contain scale invariant pieces (terms which are not repre-

sented by integrals in eqs.(24) and (25)).2) also, large distance asymptotics

of the vacuum current and energy density are scale invariant, see eqs.(28)

and (29). but the most signicant point is that, at half-integer values of

the vortex ux ({|  |} = 1

2), the vacuum condensate, as well as the vacuum
current and energy density, becomes scale invariant, see eqs.(31)  (33); con-

sequently, the total vacuum condensate becomes innite, see eq.(34). that

is only at non-half-integer values of the vortex ux, that both chiral and scale

symmetries are broken.

in conclusion, it should be emphasized once more that magnetic eld

strength 1v2  2v1 corresponding to potential (5) vanishes everywhere

on the plane punctured at x1 = x2 = 0. thus, we have shown that, in

the absence of any background eld strength or curvature, chiral symme-

try breaking occurs just due to nontrivial topology of space (in the bohm-

aharonov-eect-like manner). it would be interesting to bring possible types

of interaction among quantized fermion elds (either four-fermionic, or elec-

trodynamic) into this context in order to consider the mass gap equation and

its implications.

2)in 2+1-dimensional space-time the canonical dimension of the fermion eld operator

is equal to one in the units of the power of inverse length.
