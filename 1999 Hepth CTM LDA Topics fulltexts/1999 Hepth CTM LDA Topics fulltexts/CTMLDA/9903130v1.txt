abstract

recently, we have observed that the bosonized supersymmetric quantum mechan-
ics leads naturally to the r-deformed heisenberg algebra (rdha) related to para-
bosons and parafermions. here we show that rdha, in turn, gives rise not only
to the bosonized supersymmetry associated with wittens supersymmetric quantum
mechanics but also supplies us with a supersymmetry characterized by a nonlinear su-
peralgebra. such nonlinear supersymmetry may be specied alternatively by a central
extension of the usual n = 1 superalgebra with grading operator included nontrivially
as an even generator. the systems under consideration are described by the hamiltoni-
ans of the simplest form hn = a+a and ha = aa+ and reveal supersymmetries at the
special values of the deformation parameter corresponding to parabosons of odd order.
the peculiar nature of parabosonic supersymmetries is encoded in essentially nonlinear
structure of their supercharges realized in terms of parabosonic creation-annihilation
operators a. at the values of deformation parameter corresponding to the even order
parabosons the spectra of the hamiltonians hn and ha have no supersymmetry but
reveal holes in comparison with bosonic spectra, whose number is correlated with the
parastatistics order. it is shown that rdha and the associated linear and nonlinear
supersymmetries are realizable in the system of two identical fermions. the nonlinear
supersymmetry of pure parabosonic systems possesses the structure of a reduced para-
supersymmetry and may also be realized by appropriate modication of the classical
analog of wittens supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

1 introduction

one of the basic ingredients of supersymmetric quantum mechanics [1, 2] is the z2-grading
operator , 2 = 1, which classies all the operators into even (bosonic, b) and odd
(fermionic, f ) subsets according to the relations [, b] = {, f} = 0. the main idea of
the minimally bosonized supersymmetric quantum mechanics [3, 4] is to take the reection
(parity) operator r, r(x) = (x), as a grading operator. with this, the operators

q1 = irq2, q2 = 

i

2   d

dx

+ w (x)r! ,

h =

1

2  

d2

dx2 + w 2(x)  w (x)r! ,

(1.1)

(1.2)

containing an odd function w (x) = w (x), are the odd supercharges, {r, qi} = 0,
i = 1, 2, and the even hamiltonian, [r, h] = 0, satisfying the standard superalgebra of
wittens supersymmetric quantum mechanics:

{q+, q} = h, q2 = 0,

[h, q] = 0,

(1.3)

where q = 1

2 (q1  iq2).

with the choice of the superpotential w (x) =  

with the yang-dunkl operator [5]

2x ,   r, the operator 2q2 coincides

d = i  d

dx 


2x

r! ,

which occurs in the calogero model [6, 7] (where r is an exchange operator). with
the extended dierential operator d, one can construct the analogs of bosonic creation-
annihilation operators,

a =

1
2

(x  d).

(1.4)

these operators together with the reection operator r form the r-deformed heisenberg
algebra (rdha),

[a, a+] = 1 + r,

(1.5)
which possesses unitary innite-dimensional representations for  > 1 and at integer val-
ues of the deformation parameter  = p, p = 1, 2, . . ., is related to parabosons of the
corresponding order p [8, 9, 10]. on the other hand, at  = (2p + 1) the algebra (1.5) has
nite-dimensional representations corresponding to the (deformed) parafermions of order 2p
[10] (see appendix).

{r, a} = 0, r2 = 1,

earlier it was observed [3] that the systems given by the hamiltonians

h =

1
2{a+, a}

2

r[a, a+],

 = +,,

(1.6)

are supersymmetric: they are described by eqs. (1.1), (1.2) with w =  
2x . these systems
possess the following interesting property: in the case  = + the spectrum of the hamiltonian

2

(1.6) does not depend on the value of the deformation parameter  > 1, i.e. eq. (1.6) gives
the isospectral family of supersymmetric systems being in the phase of exact supersymmetry
(e0 = 0). on the other hand, at  =  the hamiltonian (1.6) describes the set of systems in
the phase of spontaneously broken supersymmetry with the scale of supersymmetry breaking
e0 = 1 +  > 0 governed by the value of the deformation parameter  > 1.
in this paper we shall show that the r-deformed heisenberg algebra, in turn, gives rise
not only to the bosonized supersymmetry associated with wittens supersymmetric quantum
mechanics but also supplies us with a supersymmetry characterized by nonlinear superalge-
bra or by a specic central extension of the usual n = 1 superalgebra of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics including nontrivially the grading operator as an even generator. such
nonlinear supersymmetry will be observed in the systems described by the hamiltonians of
the simplest form hn = a+a and ha = aa+ at the values of the deformation parameter
 = 2k + 1 corresponding to parabosons of odd order. so, it will be demonstrated that
the pure parabosonic systems possess usual and nonlinear supersymmetries. the peculiarity
of such supersymmetries, as we shall see, is encoded in the nature of their supercharges:
being realized in terms of parabosonic creation-annihilation operators a, they are essen-
tially nonlinear. we shall also observe that at the values of deformation parameter  = 2k
corresponding to the even order parabosons, the spectra of the hamiltonians hn and ha
have no supersymmetry but possess an interesting structure: they reveal a nite number of
holes in comparison with bosonic spectra ( = 0). this hole number is correlated with
the parastatistics order. we shall show that rdha itself and the associated linear and
nonlinear supersymmetries can be realized in the system of two identical fermions.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 is devoted to investigation of the systems
given by the normal ordered hamiltonian hn = a+a. we observe that the system charac-
terized by  = 1 reveals a usual (bosonized) supersymmetry (1.3), whereas for  = 2k + 1,
k = 1, . . ., the corresponding systems possess the nonlinear supersymmetry, which can be
treated as a reduced parasupersymmetry of the spin-j = (k + 1)/2 system. section 3 deals
with the systems described by the hamiltonian ha = aa+. here, in particular, we nd
the exotic system with the spectrum of wittens supersymmetric quantum mechanics in
the phase of exact supersymmetry but specied by the nonlinear superalgebra. section 4
concerns the realization of rdha and the associated supersymmetries in the system of two
identical fermions. in section 5 we show that the nonlinear supersymmetry of pure para-
bosonic systems may be reproduced by appropriate modication of the classical analog of the
usual supersymmetric quantum mechanics with one fermion. section 6 is devoted to discus-
sion and concluding remarks. appendix contains the necessary information on irreducible
representations of rdha and on the relationship of rdha to parabosons and parafermions.

2 the systems with hamiltonian hn = a+a

let us choose the superpotential in eqs. (1.1), (1.2) in the form

w = x 

1
2x

.

3

(2.1)

in this case the hamiltonian (1.2) can be represented equivalently as the normal ordered
product

hn = a+a

(2.2)

of the operators (1.4) corresponding to the particular value of the deformation parameter:
 = 1. this form of the hamiltonian can also be obtained from eq. (1.6) by putting in
it  = + and  = 1. the supersymmetric hamiltonian (2.2) may be written equivalently
as hn = n + , where n is a number operator, [n, a] = a, and  = 1
2(1  r) is
a projector (see appendix). from here the spectrum of the normal ordered hamiltonian
(2.2) with a corresponding to the case  = 1 of algebra (1.5) can be immediately obtained:
hn|li = el|li, e0 = 0, e2l1 = e2l = 2l, l = 1, 2, . . .. so, the bosonized supersymmetric
system characterized by superpotential (2.1) is in the phase of exact supersymmetry.
let us take now the normal form for the hamiltonian (2.2) in general case of unitary
representations of rdha ( > 1) and investigate its spectrum. in terms of the number
operator we have

the even states |2li are stable eigenstates of hn: their eigenvalues do not depend on the
deformation parameter,

hn = n + .

e

2l = e=0

2l = 2l,

whereas the eigenvalues corresponding to the odd eigenstates |2l +1i are subject to the linear
shift,

e

2l+1 = e=0

2l+1 +  = 2l + 1 + .

there are two interesting special cases given by  = 2k and  = 2k + 1 with k = 1, 2, . . ..
for  = 2k the spectrum of the system (2.2) contains k holes in comparison with the non-
deformed case  = 0: the rst k odd energy levels with e = 2h  1, h = 1, . . . , k, are absent
from it, whereas the rest of the spectrum is the same as for the bosonic system ( = 0) (see
fig. 1a).

on the other hand, the odd values of the deformation parameter,  = 2k + 1, supply
us with supersymmetry. as we have seen, at k = 0 the hamiltonian (2.2) describes the
system in the phase of exact supersymmetry with one singlet state corresponding to e = 0
and all other states to be paired in supersymmetric doublets. for k = 1, 2, . . . one gets
the nonstandard supersymmetry. it is specied by the presence of k + 1 singlet states with
energies e = 0, 2, . . . , 2k, whereas other states are paired in supersymmetric doublets with
e2l1 = e2l = 2l, l = k, k + 1, . . . (see fig. 1b).

it is interesting to note that the nonstandard supersymmetry may be treated as a reduced
parasupersymmetry. indeed, let us consider the parasupersymmetric system described by
the hamiltonian [12]

h = b+b + j3 + j.

(2.3)

here b are the bosonic creation-annihilation operators and j3 is one of the su(2) generators
taken in spin-j representation, j2 = j(j + 1), with j = (k + 1)/2, k = 1, 2, . . .. the reduction
of this spin-j parasupersymmetric system by two additional linear constraints

(j3  j)|i = 0,

(j3 + j)|i = 0

let us investigate in more detail the nature of the observed nonstandard supersymmetry.

first, one constructs the odd generators

q+ = a+, q = a+,

(2.5)

with  = 1
following superalgebra:

2 (1 r ). together with the hamiltonian and grading operator r they form the

q2 = 0,

{q+, q} = hn + k(r  1),

{r, q} = 0,
[hn, q] = 2kq,

[r, hn] = 0,

[r, q] = 2q, r2 = 1.

it can be understood as a central extension of the supersymmetric algebra (1.3) with the
grading operator r nontrivially included in the set of even generators. only for k = 0 the
odd generators q commute with hn and are the odd integrals of motion (supercharges).
in this case they coincide with the operators q = 1
2(q1  iq2), where q1,2 are constructed
according to (1.1) with w = x  1
2x . therefore, we arrive at the natural question: what are
the supersymmetric generators being odd integrals of motion which mutually transform the
supersymmetric doublet states and what kind of superalgebra do they form? such mutually
conjugate odd operators satisfying the relations {r, q} = 0 are
q = (a)2k+1+.

(2.6)

q+ = (a+)2k+1,

together with the hamiltonian hn they form the following nonlinear superalgebra:

q2 = 0,

{ q+, q} = hk(hn),

[hn, q] = 0,

(2.7)

5

where

hk(hn) = (hn  2k)(hn  2k + 2)...hn...(hn + 2k  2)(hn + 2k).

this algebra follows immediately from the relations

q+ q = hk(hn)+,

q q+ = hk(hn).

the states |0ii = |2ii, i = 0, 1, . . . , 2k, are annihilated by the odd generators, q|0ii = 0,
but only the rst state |0i1 = |0i is the vacuum: hn|0i = 0. thus, in the case  = 2k + 1 the
supersymmetry of pure parabosonic system (2.2) is characterized by the presence of k + 1
supersymmetric singlet states and corresponding superalgebra is nonlinear for k = 1, 2, . . ..

3 the systems with hamiltonian ha = aa+

let us choose now the superpotential in eqs. (1.1), (1.2) in the form

w = x 

1
2x

.

in this case the hamiltonian can be represented equivalently as the antinormal product

ha = aa+

(3.1)

of the creation-annihilation operators of rdha corresponding to the case of parabosons
of order 1 ( = 1). this antinormal form may be obtained also from the supersymmetric
hamiltonian (1.6) by putting in it  = ,  = 1. the corresponding mutually conjugate
operators q = 1

2(q1  iq2) take now the form

q+ = a++, q = a

(3.2)

instead of supercharges (2.5) of the system (2.2) at  = 1. representing the hamiltonian
(3.1) in the equivalent form ha = n + 1 + + in terms of the number operator and projector
+ = 1
2(1 + r), we conclude that it describes the system in the phase of spontaneously
broken supersymmetry characterized by the spectrum el = 2[l/2] + 2, l = 0, 1, . . . , where [.]
is the integer part.

let us follow the same idea as in the previous section and treat the creation-annihilation
operators in the hamiltonian (3.1) as the generators of rdha for the case of generalized
parabosons ( > 1). then, taking into account relation (a.5), one can represent the
hamiltonian as

ha = n + 1 + +.

therefore, the energy levels corresponding to the odd eigenstates |2l + 1i now are stable,
whereas the shift of levels corresponding to the even eigenstates |2li depends on . special
cases correspond, again, to the integer values of the deformation parameter, when rdha
species parabosons. for the parabosons of even order,  = 2k, k = 1, 2, . . ., the spectrum
is like in the non-deformed case  = 0 but with the only dierence: it contains k holes in
its lower part in comparison with the bosonic system.

6

for odd values  = 2k +1, k = 1, . . ., the spectrum looks like the spectrum of usual super-
symmetry (k = 1) shifted for el = e0 = 2, or like that of the nonstandard supersymmetry
(k = 2, 3, . . .).

let us consider the case of parabosons of odd order  = 3, 5, . . . and shift the hamiltonian

for the constant corresponding to the lowest energy level, ha  h 0

a = ha  2,

h 0
a = aa+  2.

(3.3)

then, in the case  = 3 the spectrum of the system looks like the spectrum of the system in
the phase of exact supersymmetry with the lowest singlet zero energy level and other levels
to be supersymmetric doublets. but what are the corresponding conserved (commuting with
h 0
a) odd supergenerators and what superalgebra do they form? such mutually conjugate
generators for the general case  = 2k + 1 are given by

q+ = (a+)2k+1+,

q = (a)2k+1.

(3.4)

they satisfy the following relations:

q+ q = hk(h 0

a),

q q+ = hk(h 0

a)+,

where

hk(h 0

a) = (h 0

a  2k + 2)  (h 0

a  2k + 4) . . . h 0

a . . . (h 0

a + 2k)  (h 0

a + 2k + 2).

using them, we arrive at the following nonlinear superalgebra which characterizes the system
(3.3) at  = 2k + 1 (or the system given by the hamiltonian (3.1) with the substitution
h 0
a = ha  2):

q2 = 0,

{ q+, q} = hk(h 0
a),

[h 0

a, q] = 0.

(3.5)

on the other hand, with the rst order odd generators given by eq. (3.2) the system (3.3)
can be characterized by the following central extension of the n = 1 superalgebra with the
generators q, h 0

a and r:

{q+, q} = h 0

a  kr + k + 2,

q2 = 0,

[r, h 0

{r, q} = 0,
[h 0

a, q] = 2kq,

a] = 0,
[r, q] = 2q, r2 = 1.

therefore, in the case  = 3 (k = 1) the system (3.3) has the usual spectrum of the system
in the phase of exact supersymmetry, but its odd conserving supergenerators form with the
hamiltonian the nonlinear superalgebra:

{ q+, q} = h 0

a(h 0

a + 2)(h 0

a + 4),

[h 0

a, q] = 0,

q2 = 0.

note that here the ground (supersymmetric vacuum) state is |vaci = |1i, and, so, it is odd,
r|1i = |1i, whereas |0i belongs to the rst excited supersymmetric doublet. therefore,
this system is not included in the bosonized version of wittens supersymmetric quantum
mechanics where the supersymmetric ground state is always even [4] and this explains the
appearance of the nonlinear superalgebra. note that the systems with hamiltonian (3.3)
corresponding to  = 5, 7, . . . are characterized by the same property: their ground state is
odd: |vaci = |1i, h 0

a|vaci = 0.

4 rdha in the system of identical fermions

suppose that we have the system of two identical fermions such that its space motion is
conned to the line whereas their spin degrees of freedom are not restricted and are given
by the total vector spin operator with components ji = 1
2(i  1 + 1 i). then, taking into
account the pauli principle and omitting the dependence on the center of mass coordinate,
x = 1
2(x1 + x2), we describe the two-fermion system by the wave functions of the form [4]

(x) = j3

s j3

(4.1)
 (x) + a+(x).
here j3 = 1, 0, 1, x = x1  x2 is the relative coordinate; +1
s = |i|i and
s = 12(|+i|i +|i|+i) are symmetric spin states forming a vector triplet, jijij3
0
s = 2j3
s ,
s , whereas a = 12(|+i|i  |i|+i) is antisymmetric spin-0 singlet state,
j3j3
s = j3j3
jia = 0; j3
 are odd functions, j3
 (x), and + is an even function, +(x) =
+(x). the physical operators are those transforming the states of the form (4.1) into the
states of the same form. if we assume, moreover, that there is a rotational j 2
3 -symmetry in
the spin space, then the algebra of physical operators may be generated by the operators [4]

s = |+i|+i, 1

 (x) = j3

a+ = f+ x,

operators i and i satisfy the relations ij = iij + iijkk, i = 1  j 2

3s(a) = +()s(a), i = 0, 1 = , 3 = , is(a) = 0, where we have used
the notation  = 1
let us return to the r-deformed heisenberg algebra. in the coordinate representation an
arbitrary function (x) may be decomposed into even and odd parts, (x) = +(x)+(x),
r(x) = (x). even operators f+(x, d
dx ) map the even and odd functions into the
functions of the same parity nature, whereas odd operators f(x, d
dx ) change the parity of
functions. then, taking into account the properties of operators i and i specied above,
one can arrive at the following identication of the states and operators of rdha on the one
hand, and, on the other hand, of the states and nontrivial physical operators in the j3 = 0
sector of the system of two identical fermions:

together with the operator 3 are the analogs of the creation-annihilation operators (1.4)

[a, a+] = (1 + 3)i,

{3, a} = 0, 2

3 = i,

which in the sector j3 = 0 are reduced to the relations of rdha (1.5). therefore, all the
obtained results on the supersymmetries of pure parabosonic systems can be translated to
the j3 = 0 sector of the system of two identical fermions. then the hamiltonian

2x corresponds to eq. (2.2). so, the system of two identical fermions
described by the hamiltonian (4.3) reveals usual and nonlinear supersymmetries in j3 = 0
sector when the parameter  takes the values  = 1 and  = 3, 5, 7, . . ., respectively. note
that here the states with j3 = 1 always have zero energy. can we modify the hamiltonian
(4.3) in such a way that the innitely degenerated zero energy levels corresponding to j3 = 1
states would be unfrozen without changing the supersymmetric properties of j3 = 0 sector?
a rather natural modication of the hamiltonian (4.3) is

such a way that its action on the states +1

corresponding to all odd eigenstates (given by odd functions of x) have a multiplicity equal

thus, rdha itself and the associated supersymmetries may be realized in the sector
j3 = 0 of the system of two identical fermions. the modied hamiltonians (4.4) and (4.6)
have a simple form of the hamiltonians with spin-spin interaction. they unfreeze the energy
levels of the states with j3 = 1 (which for the hamiltonians (4.3) and (4.5) turn out to
be innitely degenerated states of energy 0 and 2, respectively) leading to the multiplicity
equal to 4 for higher degenerated states.

5 nonlinear supersymmetry in boson-fermion system

nonlinear supersymmetry specic to the pure parabosonic system may also be realized by
the boson-fermion system. to construct such a boson-fermion system with nonlinear super-
symmetry, it is convenient to start from the (pseudo)classical level using the ideas of ref.
[13]. so, let us consider a nonrelativistic particle of unit mass carrying the odd degrees of
freedom described by two grassmann variables a, a = 1, 2. the general lagrangian of such
a system is

where v (x) and l(x) are two arbitrary functions and n = i12 = +,  = 12

(5.1)

where k is some natural number, satisfy the following equations of motion:

k(v   w w ).

they will be odd integrals of motion if we choose v  = 1
2 (w 2), and put l = kw . therefore,
when the functions v (x) and l(x) are related as l(x) = kw (x), v (x) = 1
2w 2(x)+c, where
c is a real constant, then the odd integrals (5.1) are the integrals of motion additional to h
and n. together with the hamiltonian

they form the following nonlinear superalgebra:

hk =

(p2 + w 2) + kw n

{q+

k , qk } = i(hk  c)k,

(5.2)
whereas n is the classical analog of the grading operator, {n, qk } = {n, hk} = 0. so, the
class of (pseudo)classical systems revealing nonlinear supersymmetric algebra is given by an
arbitrary function w (x).

k } = {qk , qk } = 0,

{hk, qk } = {q+

k , q+

let us consider the simplest example corresponding to the case of linear superpotential
w = x and put c = 0. the quantum hamiltonian of such a system is the sum of the
hamiltonians of harmonic bosonic and fermionic oscillators with the fermionic frequency
being the integer multiple of the bosonic one:

hk = hb + khf , hb = b+b, hf = f +f.

(5.3)

in the case k = 1 the system is a superoscillator [11] for which the quantum analog of
superalgebra (5.2) is given by eq. (1.3). for k = 2, 3, . . . the quantum analog of superalgebra
(5.2) for the system (5.3) takes the form similar to the nonlinear superalgebra of parabosonic
system (2.7) or (3.5):

{q+

k , qk } = h(h  1) . . . (h  k + 1).

it is clear that for the superpotential w (x) dierent from the linear one the commutator
of operators b+ and b is nontrivial and in general case this leads to the quantum anomalies
destroying the classical nonlinear supersymmetry.

in conclusion let us note that the hole structure specic for the parabosonic systems
(2.2) and (3.1) at  = 2k can also be formally reproduced by the simplest boson-fermion
system: the spectrum of the hamiltonian h = 2[b+b + (k + 1
2)f +f] reveals k holes in
comparison with the spectrum of the bosonic number operator n = b+b.

6 discussion and concluding remarks

we have found that the systems of parabosons of odd order with the hamiltonians hn =
a+a and ha = aa+ possess the usual or nonstandard supersymmetries. these supersym-
metries are characterized by the superalgebra of the form (1.3) linear in hamiltonian, or
by the nonlinear superalgebras (2.7) or (3.5). the nontrivial nature of the revealed super-
symmetries is encoded in the structure of the corresponding conserved odd operators (2.6)
and (3.4). they contain the projectors , which in terms of the parabosonic creation-
annihilation operators may be represented as

+ = cos2 f,  = sin2 f, f =


4{a+, a},

where we have used eqs. (a.3) and (a.4) and taken into account that  = 2k + 1. therefore,
the conserved odd supercharges are essentially nonlinear operators of a.

we have observed that the spectrum of supersymmetric parabosonic systems character-
ized by the presence of several supersymmetric singlet states may be reproduced by the
reduced parasupersymmetry. the interesting problem would be nding the classical analog
for the reduced parasupersymmetry. probably, the corresponding classical systems could
be realized with the usage of paragrassmann variables, and the reduction conditions (2.4)
should appear as the quantum analogs of some classical rst-class constraints.

we have shown that the r-deformed heisenberg algebra and the associated supersym-
metries of pure parabosonic systems are realizable in the j3 = 0 sector of the system of two
identical fermions. the correspondence is one-to-one and the crucial role is played here by
the pauli principle. on the other hand, by analogy with relations (4.2), one can realize the
operators a and r as

a =

1
2

1"x   d

dx 


2x

3!# , r = 3.

(6.1)

operators (6.1) satisfy the relations of rdha (1.5), but such a realization is reducible.
this is clear just from the observation that the operator r = (1)n 3, with n constructed
according to eq. (a.3), commutes with all the operators (6.1).
though we have seen that the nonlinear superalgebra may formally be reproduced via
the appropriate modication of the classical analog of the usual supersymmetric quantum
mechanics, nevertheless the quantum systems obtained after quantization are essentially
dierent from the supersymmetric pure parabosonic systems.
indeed, in supersymmetric
quantum mechanical systems there are independent fermionic f and bosonic b operators.
proceeding from the parabosonic operators a one can also construct the operators b and
f satisfying the (anti)commutation relations [b, b+] = 1, { f, f +} = 1, f2 = 0, but they
will not be independent: [b, f] 6= 0 (see refs. [3, 10]). nevertheless, it seems to be interest-
ing to continue investigation of the quantum systems corresponding to the modied classical
analog of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. first of all, one could try to nd some non-
trivial examples of the systems with superpotential dierent from the linear one which would
preserve the nonlinear supersymmetry taking place at the classical level. it would also be
interesting to investigate the possibility to generalize nonlinear (0 + 1)-dimensional super-
symmetry for the case of d + 1 dimensions. another attractive problem in the direction of
generalizations is looking for the hidden supersymmetries in pure parabosonic eld systems.

12

at last, we note that analogously to the pure parabosonic systems, the pure parafermionic
systems also reveal hidden supersymmetries. the results on observation and analysis of
supersymmetries in pure parafermionic systems will be presented elsewhere.

a appendix: irreducible representations of rdha

here we give some information on rdha and its representations, which is necessary for
understanding the main text. the details and further references may be found in [10].

as a consequence of eqs. (1.5), the operators a obey the trilinear commutation relations

[{a, a+}, a] = 2a.

(a.1)

if one denes the vacuum state as a|0i = 0, r|0i = |0i, h0|0i = 1, than eq. (1.5) gives the
relation
(a.2)

aa+|0i = (1 + )|0i.

for integer values of the deformation parameter  = p, p = 1, 2, . . ., the relation (a.2)
together with the trilinear relations (a.1) species the creation-annihilation operators of
the parabosons of order p, whereas for  > 1 (see below),  6= 0, p, the operators a
satisfying relations (1.5) may be treated as the creation-annihilation operators of generalized
parabosons [9].

the trilinear relations (a.1) can be represented equivalently as {g, a} = 0, g =
[a, a+]  1. as a consequence, [g2, a] = 0, and one concludes that in irreducible represen-
tation g2 = const. if, moreover, g is hermitian operator, then g = r with {r, a} = 0,
r2 = 1 and   r. in other words, the trilinear relations themselves lead to rdha (1.5).
relations (a.1) mean that up to the additive constant the number operator is given by
a half of anticommutator of a+ and a. the commutator from eq. (1.5) together with the
specied above denition of vacuum state xes the additive constant and we get the number
operator

n =

1
2{a+, a} 

1
2

(1 + ).

in its terms, the reection operator can be realized as

r = (1)n = cos n.

(a.3)

(a.4)

with relations (1.5) and (a.3), the normal and antinormal products of the creation-
annihilation operators can be given in terms of the number operator as follows:

a+a = n + ,

aa+ = n + 1 + +,

(a.5)

where  = 1
+ +  = 1.

2 (1  r) are the projector operators, 2

+ = +, + = 0,

we get



(1, 2) = z +
(0, 0) = 2n 2z 

|x| exp(x2)dx.

from the requirement hn|ni > 0, |ni  (a+)n|0i, n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., it follows that rdha has
unitary fock-type representations when  > 1. in this case the orthonormal eigenstates
of the number operator are given by |ni = cn(a+)n|0i, cn = ([n]!)1/2, [n]! = qn
l=1[l],
[l] = l + 1
2(1  (1)l). for integer values  = p, p = 1, 2, . . ., these representations are
equivalent to the fock representation for parabosons of the corresponding order p.
let us turn to the schrodinger (coordinate) representation. here, in correspondence with
eq. (1.4), we have 2a = x + d
2x r. then the ground state, specied by the conditions
r0 = 0, a0 = 0, is given by the function 0(x) = |x|/2 exp(x2/2)n , where n is a
normalization constant. with the scalar product dened by

dx  

1(x)2(x)dx,

(a.6)

the integral is converging (at lower limit) i  > 1, i.e.
the ground state is given by
the normalizable function only for  > 1. therefore, one concludes that in fock and
schrodinger representations singularity of   1 reveals itself in dierent ways. in fock
representation for  = 1 the state |1i has a zero norm, h1|1i = 0, whereas for  <
1 there appear the states with negative norm (in particular, h1|1i < 0). in schrodinger
representation, the ground state is not normalizable for   1 with respect to the usual
scalar product (a.6).
for the sake of completeness we note that the algebra (1.5) reveals some universality
[10]: for the special values  = (2p + 1), p = 1, 2, . . ., it has non-unitary nite-dimensional
representations characterized by the relations (a)2p+1 = 0. one can pass over to the her-
mitian conjugate operators f = a, f + = ra+. they generate the parafermionic algebra
of order 2p = 2 (for  = 3), or supply us with the deformation of parafermions of order
2p = 4, 6, . . ., which contains the internal z2-grading structure:
[[f +, f]f] = 2(2i3  1)rf,
