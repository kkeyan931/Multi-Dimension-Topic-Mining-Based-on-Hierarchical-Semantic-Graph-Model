abstract

we show that correlation functions for branched polymers correspond to those for 3
theory with a single mass insertion, not those for the 3 theory themselves, as has been
widely believed. in particular, the two-point function behaves as 1/p4, not as 1/p2.
this behavior is consistent with the fact that the hausdor dimension of the branched
polymer is four.

1 introduction

branched polymers are the simplest generalization of the random walk and have been studied
extensively.
it is of great importance not only in statistical physics but also in particle
physics, in particular, for understanding the critical behavior of random surface models and
quantum gravity (see, for example, [1]).
in the paper [2], we have studied the dynamics
of the type iib matrix model of a constructive formulation of superstring ([3] and see [4]
for review). in our matrix model approach, the eigenvalues of matrices are interpreted as
space-time coordinates. in these investigations, we nd the system of branched polymers in
a simple approximation. although it is far from the at four dimensional manifold, branched
polymers share the same (fractal) dimensionality four with our space-time. it might be the
rst indication that superstring can explain the dimensionality of our space-time.

in this letter, we comment on a eld theoretic description of branched polymers. it is
well-known that a system of random walks is described by a free scalar eld theory if there
is no eect of self-avoidance. similarly it is widely believed that the system of branched
polymers becomes a scalar eld theory with a three-point coupling, that is, 3 scalar eld
theory (see, for example, [1]). we will, however, show that it is not so by treating the
universal part of the partition function carefully. the system of branched polymers without
self-avoidance can be exactly solvable by introducing the grand canonical ensemble and using
the so called schwinger-dyson technique. in order to extract the correct large n limit (n
is the system size) or the thermodynamic limit, we have to check that the grand canonical
ensemble is dominated by the larger size system. in other words, we have to extract the
universal part.

on the contrary to a naive summation which makes us conclude that the system of
branched polymers is described by a 3 scalar eld theory, a careful treatment shows that
we need a single mass insertion in each n-point function of the 3 scalar eld theory. mass
insertion here means a change of a propagator in each n-point function from an ordinary one,
1/p2, to 1/p4. in particular, the two-point function behaves as 1/p4, not 1/p2. let us count
the number of points which lie within distance r from a xed point in d(> 4) dimensions.
in the random walk, it can be estimated as r2 by using the two point function. we obtain
r4 for branched polymers by using the 1/p4 type propagator. so our nding are consistent
with the claim that branched polymers are four dimensional fractals. a multi-point green
function is given by a sum of graphs of the corresponding green function for 3 scalar eld
theory at tree level with a single mass insertion in each graph.

the organization of this paper is the following. first we dene a canonical ensemble
for a system of branched polymers (sec. 2.1) and then introduce grand canonical ensembles
(sec. 2.2). we emphasize that a denition of grand canonical ensemble is not unique. in
sec. 2.3, we solve schwinger-dyson equations for the grand canonical ensembles and obtain
naive results of the correlation functions of a scalar 3 theory. in sec. 2.4, we consider the
thermodynamic limit and give the correct universal behavior of the correlation functions.
finally in section 3, we conclude and give an interpretation of our result.

2 branched polymer dynamics

2.1 canonical ensemble

branched polymers are a statistical system of n points connected by n  1 bonds whose
lengths are of order a0. the canonical partition function is dened as

zn =

1

n! xg:tree graph

z

n

yi=1

dxi y(ij):bonf of g

f (xi  xj),

(1)

where f (x) is a function assigned to each bond in each graph, and it damps suciently fast
at long distance compared to the typical length scale a0. (see, for example, gure 1.) the
presence of the factor 1/n! is due to the fact that the n points are regarded identical.

we can calculate a partition function for each n, by counting the number of all possible

tree graphs:

z2 =

z1 = v
1
2!
1
3!
1
4!

f (0)v

3 f (0)2v

16 f (0)3v

z3 =

z4 =

zn =

where f (p) is a fourier transform of f (x);

n n 2 f (0)n 1v,

f (p) = z dx eipx f (x),

and v is the total volume of the system. a derivation of the general form (6) is given in the
appendix.

we dene an (unnormalized) m-point correlation function of density operators as

gm

f(x)

where the density operator is dened by

xi=1

(d)(x  xi).

(8)

(9)

2.2 grand canonical ensemble

we then dene partition functions and m-point correlation functions in the grand canonical
ensemble in the following equations:

z0,l =

gm
0,l(x1,    , xm) =



xn =1
xn =1



n l n

0 zn ,

n l n

0 gm

n (x1,    , xm),

(10)

(11)

where 0 is fugacity. there exist various ways of dening grand canonical ensemble cor-
responding to the freedom to choose dierent weights for each xed n sector. here, we
assigned an extra n-dependent factor, n l, in addition to the usual one, n
0 . the criterion
for a good grand canonical ensemble is such that we can take the correct thermodynamic
limit, or, in other words, we can correctly take the universal part in the sum (10) or (11).
that is, the correlation functions in the grand canonical ensemble at the critical value of
fugacity should reproduce those in the canonical ensemble for large n:

lim
n

gm
n
zn

= lim

00,c

gm
0,l
z0,l

.

(12)

we illustrate the above mentioned criterion by taking partition function as an example.

since the canonical ensemble partition function (6) behaves at large n as

zn 

n 5/2
2en

f (0)n 1v,

the grand canonical partition function is approximated by

z0,l 



where



v

xn =1

2 f(0) z

 = f (0)0,
c = e1,

if we take l suciently large, the integrand in eq. (15) has a peak at n  c/ and we
can make n large by approaching  to c. on the other hand, if l is not suciently large, a
non-universal small n behavior dominates the summation and we cannot obtain the correct
answer of the large n limit by a grand canonical ensemble.

2.3 schwinger-dyson eq.

in this subsection, we recapitulate the (naive) arguments that the correlation functions
for branched polymers are given by massless 3 theory [1][2]. lets consider the following
correlation functions, which are suitable for a schwinger-dyson analysis:

f m(x1,    , xm) =



n
0

xn =1
 y(ij):bond of g

z
(n  m)! xg:tree graph
f (yi  yj).

n

yi=1

dyi (d)(y1  x1)    (d)(ym  xm)

(19)

the factor
identical. we can see from eq. (11) and eq. (8) that

(n m)! means that (n  m) points other than the xed m points are regarded

1

f m(x1,    , xm)  gm

0,l=0(x1,    , xm)

(20)

in the large n limit. we write a fourier transform of f m(x1,    , xm) as f m(p1,    , pm1):

(2)d(d)(p1 +    + pm) f m(p1,    , pm1)
= z ddx1    ddxm eip1x1

   eipmxm f m(x1,    , xm).

schwinger dyson equation for 1-point function f 1 becomes

where

b = eb,

b  f (0) f 1,

as can be seen from gure 2. figure 3 illustrates eq. (22).

at the critical point,

bc = 1,
c = e1,

1-point function b/k diverges. near this critical point, n becomes large;

where

b 

2e  1/n,

b = bc  b,
 = c  .

next, we consider the 2-point function f 2(p). when we pick up any two points on a tree
graph, we can x the path connecting these two points. thus, as can be seen from gure 4,
2-point function is calculated to be

f 2(p) =



xs=1

f (p)s( f 1)s+1

=

b2h(p)

f(0)(1  bh(p))

where

h(p)  f (p)/ f(0)

= 1  ca2

0p2 +    .

(29)

(30)

(31)
(32)

here c is a positive constant of order one. recall that f (x) damps rapidly out of the

region 0 < x < a0, as shown in gure 1.

near the critical point, b  bc = 1, 2-point correlation function behaves as

(33)

f 2(p)

figure 4: 2-point function f 2 is made out of 1-point function f 1, which is written by a gray
blob.

0p2 .



(34)

here we used eq. (26). thus, the correlation length is  = a0n 1/4, which implies the
hausdor dimension of branched polymer is four. if the relevant length scale is shorter than
the correlation length, f 2(p)  1/p2 behaves like a propagator of a massless scalar eld. let
us consider the following region:

a0  x   = a0n 1/4.

(35)

a0 gives an ultraviolet cut-o whereas  gives an infrared cut-o length over which correlation
functions damp rapidly. note that, in this region and near the critical point, the following
inequality holds:

finally, we consider correlation functions of m > 2. as in the case of the two-point
function, m points are xed on each tree graph. we can uniquely x the path connecting
them on each graph. therefore, an m-point function f m is represented as a summation over
all tree diagrams with m xed points in which f 2 appear as propagators. for example,

f 3(p, q) = (b/ f (0))2 f 2(p) f 2(q) f 2(p + q)

+(b/ f (0))1[ f 2(p) f 2(q) + f 2(p) f 2(p + q) + f 2(q) f 2(p + q)],

(37)

as we can see from gure 5. however, because of the inequality (36), the diagrams with the
maximum number of propagators dominate. in the case of 3-point function, the rst term

in eq. (37) dominates. in general, we obtain a naive result for m-point correlation functions;

f m  correlation functions of massless 3 theory at tree level.

(38)

in the next subsection, we will see that these naive results do not correspond to the correct
thermodynamic results

2.4 correlation functions in thermodynamic limit
as we mentioned in eq. (20), gm

0,l=0 is equal to f m in the large n limit:

gm
0,l=0(p1,    , pm1)  f m(p1,    , pm1).

(39)

then, let us consider the m-point correlation functions with l  1. from the denition
(11), they can be obtained by applying l-th derivative to the l = 0 case:

gm
0,l(p1,    , pm1) = (0
= (

)l gm

0,l=0(p1,    , pm1)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

here, we have used the inequality (36) since we are interested in the correlation functions
in the physical region (35) near the critical point. this behavior is dierent from that of
g2
0,l=0  1/p2. similarly for l > 1, the behavior of 2-point function becomes

g2
0,l1(p)

and coincides with the l = 1 result. due to the inequality (36), the derivative 
b is dominated
to act on 1
1bh(p). thus, their p-dependences are all the same. this is the correct
thermodynamic limit. that is, we should consider a grand canonical correlation function
with l  1, otherwise a non-universal small n behavior aects the summation and we cannot
obtain the universal result. note that the behavior of g2
0,l1(p)  1/p4 is consistent with
the fact that the hausdor dimension of the branched polymer is four. a naive argument
expected from the gure 4 is that the eect of branching can be absorbed by renormalizing
the mass. if so, the propagator behaves as that of random walks. we discuss in section 3
why this argument is not correct.

7

similarly, 3-point functions become

g3
0,l=0(p, q)  g(p)g(q)g(p + q),
g3
0,l1(p, q)  g(p)g(q)g(p + q) + g(p)g(q)g(p + q) + g(p)g(q)g(p + q),

where

g(p) =

g(p) =

p2 ,
1  bh(p) 
(1  bh(p))2 

1

1
p4 .

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

note that only one propagator in a graph is replaced by g(p), since the derivative 
dominated to act on the factor
m-point correlation functions,

b is
1
1b, as in the case of 2-point functions. therefore, for

gm
0,l=0  correlation functions for 3 theory at tree level
(51)
gm
0,l1  correlation functions for 3 theory at tree level with a mass insertion (52)
and the correct correlation function in the thermodynamic limit should be given by eq. (52),
not by eq. (51).

as a consistency check, the following relation between an (m+1)-point function and an

m-point function must hold:

gm+1(p1,    , pm1, pm = 0) = gm(p1,    , pm1).

(53)

it actually holds because in the l.h.s. of eq. (53), the special class of diagrams dominate in
which the m-th end point is attached to the propagator g(pm). it is due to the inequality
g(p = 0)  g(p = 0). then, it is equal to the r.h.s. of eq. (53).

3 conclusion and discussion

in this letter we have shown that the correlation functions for branched polymers are given
by those for 3 theory at tree level with a single mass insertion if we correctly take the
thermodynamic limit. it is not given by those for 3 theory at tree level themselves, as has
been widely believed.

our result can be interpreted as follows. since the 1-point function behaves as

at large n (see eq. (15)), we obtain a relation;

n  n 3/2(e f (0))n
g1

n  z dn  g1
g1

n  g1

(n n ).

(54)

(55)

this relation reminds us of the situation in the two-dimensional quantum gravity (see, for
example, [5]). two dimensional quantum gravity is known to describe a fractal space-time.

it consists of numerous tiny baby universes and a single mother universe. in our case, this
analogy means that if we divide any tree graph into two by cutting a bond, we nd only nite
points in one of them and the most of the points belong to the other. in the case of m-point
functions, there is a single mother universe on a blob in the path connecting these m points.
lets consider the case of the two-point function as a simplest example. naively the gure 4
implies that the propagator behaves as that of the simpler random walk if each blob is on an
equal footing. however one of the blobs in gure 4 becomes the mother universe consisting
of innitely many points and it is entirely dierent from the other blobs. therefore we have
to divide the path into two parts by cutting out the mother universe. each part can be
considered as a propagator of random walks whose weights are dressed by blobs. this is
the reason why we have obtained the propagator behaving as 1/p4 instead of 1/p2. in other
words, the mother universe (the blob with innitely many points) corresponds to a mass
insertion and the other blobs renormalize the correlation length  of random walks from
a0n 1/2 to a0n 1/4. we can also apply a similar argument for the higher-point functions. one
of the blobs becomes the mother universe, which corresponds to the single mass insertion in
the 3 scalar eld theory.

in this appendix, we derive the canonical-ensemble partition function (6) from the schwinger-
