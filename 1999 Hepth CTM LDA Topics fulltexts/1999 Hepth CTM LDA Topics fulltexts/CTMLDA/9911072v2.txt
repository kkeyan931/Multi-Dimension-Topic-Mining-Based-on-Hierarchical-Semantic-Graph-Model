abstract

projecting a non-abelian su (2) vacuum gauge eld  a pure gauge con-
structed from the group element u  onto a xed (electromagnetic) direc-
tion in isospace gives rise to a nontrivial magnetic eld, with nonvanishing
magnetic helicity, which coincides with the winding number of u . although
the helicity is not conserved under maxwell (vacuum) evolution, it retains
one-half its initial value at innite time.

i. introduction

it has been suggested that primordial magnetic elds can develop large correlation

lengths provided they carry nonvanishing magnetic helicity r d3r ab, a quantity known
to particle physicists as the abelian, euclidean chern-simons term. here a is an abelian
gauge potential for the magnetic eld b =   a. if there exists a period of decaying
turbulence in the early universe, which can occur after a rst-order phase transition, a
magnetic eld with nonvanishing helicity could have relaxed to a large-scale conguration,
which enjoys force-free dynamics (source currents for the magnetic elds proportional to
the elds themselves) thereby avoiding dissipation [1].

in this paper we accomplish two things. first we show that congurations of (a, b),
with quantized helicity, arise from vacuum congurations of a non-abelian su(2) vector
potential. the quantization occurs because (a, b) wind and intertwine in an intricate
manner. we relate this winding number of our abelian elds to the topological prop-
erties of the structures in a non-abelian su(2) gauge group. our construction is based
on 3(s3), which is relevant to a non-abelian gauge theory in 3-space. [the construction

can also be described in terms of hopf maps and 3(s2), which have already appeared in
the literature [2]; we show how our expressions appear in that formalism.] only integer
winding numbers occur in the mathematical setting of 3(s3) or 3(s2); yet we nd that
half-integer windings also lead to interesting abelian gauge elds.

second, we study the time evolution of the magnetic helicity. since d

dt r d3r a  b =
2r d3r e  b as a consequence of the denition for the electric eld, e, time variation
is determined by the specic physical situation that xes e  b. for plasma physics or
magnetohydrodynamics the projection of e on b is proportional to the resistivity of the
medium, and vanishes for innite conductivity (zero resistivity), see sec. iv.
in that
approximation, helicity is conserved. however, cosmological electromagnetic elds can
be expected also to experience evolution in vacuum, where e  b 6= 0. therefore, it is
interesting to determine what happens to the magnetic helicity under maxwell evolution.
specically, we posit that at t = 0 there are magnetic elds with quantized helicity, and
no electric elds. with this initial data, we solve the maxwell equations and nd that
at t =  the helicity is precisely half its initial value. the calculation is carried out
explicitly for two interesting cases (integer and half-integer quanta) and then a general
argument is given, which requires a regularity hypothesis.

in section ii, we describe how to construct from non-abelian vacuum elds abelian
gauge elds with quantized helicity. in section iii, we study time evolution. conclud-
ing remarks comprise section iv, where we also speculate on the applicability of these
mathematical considerations to the su(2) u(1) standard model, before and after its
electroweak phase transition.

in the second equality, the ai are elements of the lie algebra with generators t a

ai = aa

[t a, t b] = fabct c ,

tr t at b = ab/2

while form notation is used in the third equality: a  ai dxi. the normalization factor

162 times the
only the bilinear part of (2.1) survives. thus our chern-simons quantity is
magnetic helicity, which entered physics in the work of woltier [3] and was subsequently
further elaborated by many people, including moatt, berger and field, as well as arnold

r. jackiw and so-young pi  creation and evolution of magnetic helicity

and khesin [4]. particle physicists have considered both abelian and non-abelian chern-
simons terms on 3-dimensional minkowski space in studies of (2 + 1)-dimensional gauge
theories [5].

to show how abelian elds with nonvanishing and quantized helicity arise from non-

abelian vacuum congurations, we recall rst that under a gauge transformation

a  au  u 1au + u 1du

where u is an element of the gauge group, the chern-simons term transforms as

cs(au ) = cs(a) +

1

82 z d(tr du u 1a) +

1

242 z tr(u 1du)3

(2.2)

(2.3)

with suciently regular a and u, the second term on the right side integrates to zero
[6]. however, the last term, also a total derivative  although that is not apparent from
its formula (but see below)  depends only on the group element, and is not damped by
any fall-o of a. indeed its value is the winding number of u, which eects a mapping
from 3-space into the group.

w (u) =

1

242 z dr(u 1du)3

(2.4)

w (u) is an integer when u is nonsingular for nite r and tends to i at innity, for
then 3-space can be compactied to the 3-sphere, and we assume that the gauge group
contains su(2). thus we are relying on 3(su(2)) = 3(s3) = integers.
it follows
therefore that the chern-simons number of a non-abelian vacuum gauge potential, that
is, one which is a pure gauge

is the winding number of u.

let us now specialize to su(2). then u involves the pauli matrices t a = a/2i.

a = u 1du

(2.5)

u = eat a

= cos f /2  iaba sin f /2
162 z d(cid:16)abcba dbb dbc (f  sin f )(cid:17)

(2.6)

(2.7)

and the winding number is explicitly seen to involve a total derivative [7]

w (u) = 

where ba is a unit vector in isospace: a = baf .

b. constructing an abelian gauge eld

consider next the abelian gauge potential 1-form a, constructed from a non-abelian
vacuum conguration u 1du by projecting the latter on a xed direction in isospace,

specied by a constant unit vector bna

r. jackiw and so-young pi  creation and evolution of magnetic helicity

in components, this reads

a = i tr bnaau 1du

where a a

i is the vacuum (pure gauge) non-abelian potential

ai = bnaa a

u 1iu = a a

which satises

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

note that a is not an abelian pure gauge.

we now show that the magnetic helicity of a coincides with w (u). the magnetic

helicity, with our normalization, is given by

h(a) =

(2.12a)

(2.12b)

(2.13)

(2.14a)

and we conclude that the magnetic helicity is quantized by the winding number of the
non-abelian vacuum conguration.

the form of the abelian potential a may be given explicitly. parameterizing the unit

vector ba as

ba = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos )

and taking bna to point in the third (electromagnetic) direction, we nd

a = cos  df  (sin f ) sin  d  (1  cos f ) sin2  d

r. jackiw and so-young pi  creation and evolution of magnetic helicity

5

an alternate formula presents (2.14a) in clebsch form, which will be useful later. (the
clebsch form for an arbitrary 3-vector v is v =  + where , ,  are three scalar
functions.)

a = d(2) + 2(cid:16)1  (sin2 f /2) sin2 (cid:17) d( + tan1[(tan f /2) cos ](cid:17)

(2.14b)

the magnetic eld is determined by the 2-form obtained from (2.14a)

da = sin h(1  cos f ) df d  2(1  cos f ) cos  d d + (sin f ) sin  d dfi (2.15a)

or from the clebsch expression (2.14b)

da = 2 d(cid:16)(sin2 f /2) sin2 (cid:17) d(cid:16) + tan1[(tan f /2) cos ](cid:17)

finally the magnetic helicity becomes, according to (2.14a) and (2.15a)

h(a) = 
or from (2.14b) and (2.15b)

82 z (1  cos f ) sin  df d d

h(a) =

(2.15b)

(2.16a)

(2.16b)

in the clebsch parameterization, the magnetic helicity is seen to involve integration of a
total derivative and is therefore given by a surface integral.

the explicit clebsch expressions for a and da demonstrate that one may nd two

magnetic surfaces, sn (n = 1, 2), which satisfy da dsn = b  sn = 0

s1 = (sin f /2) sin  = c

s2 =  + tan1h(tan f /2) cos i = 0

c, 0 constants

(2.17)

the intersection of these surfaces forms magnetic lines, that is, integral curves of b that
solve the dynamical system

where  is an evolution parameter for the dynamical system. evidently, for our congu-
ration this problem in integrable, leading to curves given by

qsin2(  0) + c2 cos2(  0)

(2.19)

c. hopf mapping

it is known that the abelian chern-simons term can be related to the degree of the
hopf map, which is quantized according to 3(s2) [2]. the construction of the relevant

u2(cid:17)
vector potential proceeds in the following manner. consider a complex spinor u = (cid:16) u1
with uu = |u1|2 + |u2|2 = 1. then n a  uau is a unit vector and the hopf curvature
is dened by

bi =

1
4

ijkabcn ajn bkn c

(2.20)

because bi is divergence-free, it can be written as the curl of a potential ai given by
iuiu. by comparison with (2.14b) we nd that our potential arises when u is chosen
as

u = 


q1  (sin2 f /2) sin2  e2i tan1[(tan f /2)(cos )]

(sin f /2) sin e2i




(2.21)

and the hopf index coincides with the helicity of the here-constructed (a, b).

evidently, the present expressions are awkward when compared to those based on

3(s3), presumably because the latter construction is directly related to gauge elds.

d. explicit expressions

henceforth we work with explicit expressions obtained by identifying ba in (2.6) with
the radial unit vector bra and taking f to depend only on r. this further means that  in
 in (2.13) are identied with polar and azimuthal angles of spherical coordinates  and
, with ranges 0     and 0    2 respectively. (a simple generalization would
be to identify  and  with integer multiples of  and .) the magnetic helicity (2.16)
then becomes

(2.22)

2 z 

0

dr

d
dr

(f  sin f ) =

2

(f  sin f )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=

where we have taken f (0) to vanish. observe that when sin f () is nonvanishing h
is an irrational/transcendental number. when f () is an even integer multiple of ,
sin f () vanishes and h is an integer. but note that also an odd integer multiple of 
for f () leads to vanishing sin f (), and a half-integer value for h. therefore it appears
to us that congurations with half-integer magnetic helicity are also singled out. the
half-integer elds share further good properties with the integer-valued congurations:
we shall show below that only for these two the winding number does not change under
the gauge transformation to the coulomb gauge.

when reference is made back to the non-abelian vacuum conguration, which deter-
mines a, we see from (2.6) that for the integer windings u r i, as expected. for
the half-integer ones, a hedgehog asymptote is attained: u r i  br.

since b is -independent, the  integration is trivial, leaving

the integral is over the positive-x (x, z) half-plane and b is the toroidal magnetic eld,
perpendicular to that plane. so h measures the ux of the toroidal magnetic eld
through a half-plane.

note that the functions occurring in our clebsch parameterization are multivalued,
owing to the presence of the naked azimuthal angle  and the tan1. this is as it must be,
because the helicity is nonvanishing [8]. indeed the multivaluedness of  is responsible
for the nonzero value of the  surface integral (2.25), which reproduces the helicity.

when using a in a description of electromagnetic elds, we are eectively in the a0 = 0,
weyl gauge. but also the vector potential must be transverse since there are no sources.
however, the potential in (2.23) is not transverse for general f . transversality may be
achieved in one of two ways. we may perform a gauge transformation, transforming a
to a transverse expression at . alternatively, we may choose the function f so that a is
transverse. we discuss these two possibilities in turn.

the transversality condition aects only the poloidal components of a (ar and a),
because the toroidal component (a) is -independent. by using a gauge function pro-
portional to cos  times a function of r, one can choose that function so that the resulting,
gauge equivalent potential is transverse. the components of the transverse potential then
read

of course the magnetic eld remains unchanged, but we must still check the helicity
integral: while the integrand is gauge dependent, the integral changes only be a surface
term.
it may be that the above gauge transformation contributes from the surface.
indeed this happens for general f : one nds

h(at ) = h(a) +

1
6

(1  cos f ) sin f(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=

(2.27)

and the helicity of the gauge-equivalent, transverse conguration diers from the original
expression. however if, and only if, f goes at innite r to an even or odd multiple of , the
gauge variance vanishes. thus both integer and half-integer windings are stable against
this gauge transformation, which renders the potential transverse, but for other, irrational
windings, the winding number loses its meaning because it is gauge dependent [9].

the other way to achieve transversality is to impose that condition on the original

conguration (2.23), thereby determining f . transversality requires that f satisfy

r2f  + 2rf   2 sin f = 0

(2.28)

although this equation cannot be solved by elementary functions, it is easily analyzed by
analogy to a mechanical problem where time is ln r/r0. one nds two solutions that
are regular at the origin, vanishing linearly with r, and tending to  in an oscillatory
manner for large r. moreover, the scale of r is arbitrary: the solutions are a universal
function of r/r0 and its negative; the positive solution is plotted in fig. 1. evidently this
transverse potential necessarily corresponds to half-integer winding [10].

iii. time evolution

according to maxwells vacuum equations the transverse vector potential satises the
wave equation, which we integrate subject to the initial condition that a is given at time
t = 0 by (2.26), with a denite choice for f , and that d
dt a is zero. thus at initial time,
there is no electric eld and only the magnetic eld (2.24) is present, maintained for t < 0
by a steady current j =   b.

it is seen that for t  , h attains one-half its value at t = 0.
while one would like to have an understanding how the localization of the helicity
changes with time, it does not seem possible to pose such a question in a meaningful way,
because the helicity density, namely, the integrand that denes h, is gauge dependent,
and without invariant meaning. indeed, as we have noted earlier, even the integrated
helicity can be gauge dependent when the elds and the gauge function survive on the
surfaces bounding the integration region. (this points to an analogy with the energy
in general relativity, whose density is dieomorphism-dependent. only the integrated
quantity is invariant and a unique value is determined only after asymptotic conditions
are prescribed. furthermore, the energy may be presented as a surface integral and so
also can the helicity, when the clebsch parameterization is used for the gauge potential.)
the result that under maxwell evolution h decreases to half its value at innite time
can also be understood from a general argument. in the weyl-coulomb gauge, which we
are using, the vector potential satises the wave equation, which is uniquely solved with
our posited initial conditions by

at (t, r) = z d3k

(2)3 cos kteikrat (k)

(3.6)

here at (k) is fourier transform of the initial data (2.26) and d
vanishes at t = 0. it follows that

(3.8)

by appealing to the riemann-lebesgue lemma, we can argue that the term involving the
cosine disappears at large t, owing to destructive interference, leaving half the value at

r. jackiw and so-young pi  creation and evolution of magnetic helicity

11

t = 0. however, this step is justied provided the rest of integrand is well behaved at
k = 0, which in turn depends on the behavior of at (r) at large r. a dimensional estimate
shows that a large-distance decrease of at faster than 1/r is sucient, which would mean
that b should decrease faster than 1/r2. but (3.4a) exhibits a large r behavior for b of
order 1/r2, modulated by an angular factor. since our explicit calculation supports the
general argument, the angular factor evidently provides sucient large-r damping.

iv. conclusion

our investigation is based on the connection between the winding number of non-
abelian gauge group elements and the chern-simons number of abelian gauge elds that
are obtained from the former by projection. this mathematical fact suggests a physical
scenario for the su(2)u(1) standard model. before its (rst-order) phase transition,
its vacuum could be populated by pure gauge, vacuum congurations u 1du of the su(2)
gauge group, which carry nonvanishing winding numbers. after the phase transition,
one direction in isospace is identied with electromagnetism, and the projection of the
vacuum conguration becomes a magnetic eld with nonvanishing helicity. it remains
to be shown whether the above scenario is energetically stable and can be justied on
physical grounds.

another problem deserving further study concerns nontrivial evolution of an initial
conguration with magnetic helicity. rather than using the free maxwell equations, one
would rely on the magnetohydrodynamical ones, which make use of ohms law to express
e in terms of b and j. its nonrelativistic form is

j = (e + v  b)

(4.1)

where  is conductivity and v is the uid velocity, taken to be divergenceless in a uid
of constant density. inserting this in the maxwell equation

b
t

+   e = 0

produces an evolution equation for b

b
t    (v  b) = 

1


  j .

(4.2)

(4.3)

further, approximating j by   b, that is, ignoring e/t because it is negligible on
the relevant time scales, converts the above into

b
t    (v  b) =

1
2b

(4.4)

which can be analyzed either with v prescribed externally or determined self-consistently
by its euler equation, with initial b of the form (2.24). an interesting choice for an

external v could be a transverse form that carries nonvanishing kinetic helicity r d3r v
(  v); for example, what one gets by taking v in the form a of (2.23) with f solving

r. jackiw and so-young pi  creation and evolution of magnetic helicity

12

(2.28). for zero resistivity (innite conductivity) the right side of (4.4) is absent  there
is no dissipation. then e = v  b and magnetic helicity is conserved, since e  b
vanishes.

[9] the response to more general gauge transformations is as follows. choosing the
gauge function (cos )(r) [so that the form (2.23) is preserved] ar, a change into
ar = (cos )(f  +  ), a = (sin ) 1
r (sin f + ). consequently the winding number
becomes h(a) = h(a)  1
6 (1  cos f )|r=. congurations with integer winding
remain gauge invariant [provided (r) does not increase too rapidly at innity]. for
all other congurations, (r) must vanish at innity to maintain gauge invariance
of h. moreover, the gauge function (cos )(r) is well-dened at innity only for
vanishing . (we thank a. polychronakos for discussion.)

[10] eq. (2.28) was integrated numerically by y. bergner.
[11] this magnetic eld with integer winding number has also been constructed by c.
adam, b. muratori, and c. nash, phys. rev. d 60, 125001(1999) and m. giovannini,
hep-th/9906241. half-integer winding numbers are studied also in adam et al. in
the work cited as well as in k. haller, l. chen, and y.s. choi, phys. rev. d 60,
125010(1999).
