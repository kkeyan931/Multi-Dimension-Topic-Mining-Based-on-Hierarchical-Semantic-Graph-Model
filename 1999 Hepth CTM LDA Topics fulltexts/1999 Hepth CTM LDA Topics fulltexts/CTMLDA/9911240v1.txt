introduction

perhaps the most extensively tested and studied version of the ads/cft correspondence
is that of n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory in (3 + 1) dimensions and the
compactication of iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [1]. the relationship between
supergravity elds and yang-mills operators can most easily be mapped out from the
representation structure of the extended superconformal algebra. taken at face value
one might be tempted to conclude that the ads/cft correspondence itself may be little
more than a convenient way to encode this representation theory, but this view is too
facile, and perhaps one of the remarkable lessons from the last year has been just how
deeply this correspondence works, even far from the conformal regime.

one of the purposes of this talk is to describe one of the more non-trivial tests of
the correspondence [2, 3], a test in which one moves far from the n = 4 superconformal
regime of the yang-mills theory: i will discuss how supergravity correctly describes
an n = 1 supersymmetric renormalization group ow, and how this ow can be
checked rather well against known eld theory results. a by-product of this study
of renormalization group ows is the discovery of a general c-theorem for any such ow
described via supergravity. the c-function does everything that one wants of such a
function: it is monotonic decreasing on all ows to the infra-red, and is only stationary
at conformal xed points, and at such xed points it is equal to the central charge of the
xed-point theory. on a more philosophical level, given that the renormalization group

ow is being modelled by a ve-dimensional cosmological solution, it is also satisfying
that the central charge is related to the inverse of the cosmological entropy density.

using supergravity to describe renormalization group ows was rst discussed in
[5, 6], but these ows were non-supersymmetric and they went to unstable supergravity
vacua. the lack of supersymmetry makes it hard to independently verify the results via
eld theory, and the lack of stability suggests that the ir eld theory limit may in fact
be pathological (non-unitary). the solution and ow discussed here has neither of these
problems, and indeed the supergravity computations match perfectly with independent
eld theory results.

a secondary purpose of this talk will be to revisit some ancient issues in supergravity,
most particularly that of consistent truncation, and discuss the relevance of these issues
to the phase structure and ows in yang-mills theory. the nal part of my talk will
focus on how supergravity distinguishes between perturbations of the yang-mills action
and states in the hilbert space. as an illustration of this i will discuss the supergravity
description of part of the coulomb branch of the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory [4].

2. gauged n = 8 supergravity in five dimensions

2.1. ancient issues: embedding and consistent truncation

maximal supergravities in any dimension can usually be obtained by trivial dimensional
reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity on a torus. such supergravities are
ungauged in that all the vector elds have abelian gauge symmetries, and these gauge
elds are not minimally coupled to the fermions. gauging refers to converting part of
the global symmetry into a local one by introducing the appropriate couplings by hand,
with a coupling constant, g, and then constructing the supersymmetric model by the
noether procedure. if the gauge group is non-abelian then one can show very generally
that any ground state that leaves the symmetries unbroken is necessarily anti-de sitter
space, with a cosmological constant proportional to g2. there are sometimes several
options as to the choice of gauge group, but here i will only consider the gauged theories
with maximal supersymmetry and the maximal so(m) gauge symmetry. such theories
are related to sphere compactication of iib and eleven dimensional supergravity.

it is important to stress that gauged supergravity theories are consistent, classical
eld theories in their own right. their structure is generically very non-linear,
particularly in the scalar sector. however, it is also important to remember that the
complete structure of these theories is completely determined by: (i) supersymmetry,
gauge and global symmetries, and (ii) the perturbative eld content. given this, and
the assumption of only second-derivative actions, the noether procedure is essentially
unambiguous.

3

it is a separate issue as to how gauged supergravities may be related to
compactications of higher dimensional supergravities, and indeed, one of the key issues
is whether they are actually embedded in the higher dimensional theory. since the lower
dimensional theory is a truncation of the higher dimensional theory down to some subset
of lowest modes there is the obvious question as to whether the truncation is consistent
with the equations of motion of the higher dimensional eld theory, or whether the lower
dimensional eld theory is merely some eective low energy truncation. in this context,
embedding is the strongest option: it means that the equations of motion of the higher
dimensional eld theory are exactly satised if one satises the equations of motion of
the lower dimensional theory. in particular, a solution to the lower dimensional theory
automatically yields a solution to the higher dimensional theory.

embedding, or consistent truncation is trivial

for toroidal compactications
where one takes all elds to be independent of the toroidal coordinates, but it
is highly non-trivial for the sphere compactications that lead to maximal gauged
supergravities. embedding of gauged supergravity is almost completely proven for the
s7 compactication and s4 compactication of eleven dimensional supergravity [7]. it
has not been proven for gauged n = 8 supergravity in ve dimensions and the s5
compactication of the iib theory. however there is a signicant body of evidence to
support this correspondence, and the similarities with the other sphere compactications
make the case very convincing. i will therefore assume that the ve-dimensional gauged
supergravity is indeed embedded in the iib theory, and proceed.

2.2. the field/operator correspondence

the eld content of gauged n = 8 supergravity is a graviton, eight spin- 3
2 elds, twelve
tensor gauge elds, fteen vector gauge elds, forty-eight spin- 1
2 elds, and forty two
scalars. the ungauged theory has a global e6(6) symmetry and a composite local usp(8)
symmetry, with the scalars parametrized in terms of the coset e6(6)
u sp(8). in the gauged
supergravity theory [9] the global e6(6) is replaced by a local so(6) symmetry and a
global sl(2, ir). the latter can be thought of as the sl(2, ir) symmetry inherited from
the iib theory, with the dilaton and axion corresponding to the coset sl(2,ir)
. at the
u (1)
quantum level this sl(2, ir) must therefore be broken to sl(2, zz).

even though the e6(6) symmetry is broken in the gauged theory it is still convenient
u sp(8) , but now the scalars also have a potential

to think of the scalar elds as living on e6(6)
v() proportional to g2. this potential is invariant under so(6)  sl(2, ir).

the ads/cft correspondence implies [1, 10, 11] that this n = 8 gauged
supergravity multiplet must correspond to the n = 4 yang-mills energy-momentum
tensor supermultiplet, with the local so(6) symmetry dual to the r-symmetry.

 consistent truncation has been recently proven for a subsector of the theory [8].

4

the scalar elds of the supergravity lie in the following so(6) representations:
1  1  10  10  20, with the two singlets being the ten-dimensional dilaton and
axion. from this one can deduce that these supergravity scalars correspond, respectively,
to the gauge coupling, the -angle, the fermion bilinear operators and the scalar bilinear
operator of the yang-mills theory. the latter have the form:
1
6

tr (i j) , tr (i j) , tr (x a x b) 

ab tr (x c x c) .

(1)

2.3. phases and operator product algebras

when one combines the embedding of gauged supergravity with the ads/cft
correspondence one is led to some interesting statements about the yang-mills theory.
consistent truncation implies that the operator product of elds in the energy-
momentum supermultiplet must be closed at large n, a fact that has been demonstrated
in [12]. conversely, the fact that this operator product algebra does not close at nite
n implies that gauged n = 8 supergravity is an incomplete quantum theory. the
presence and exact knowledge of the supergravity potential (and other highly non-linear
structure in supergravity) implies a completely determined, highly non-trivial operator
algebra. furthermore, critical points of the potential give rise to anti-de sitter vacua
in supergravity, which will, under appropriate conditions, imply non-trivial conformal
xed points for the yang-mills theory. the supergravity scalars whose vevs lead to
the new critical point tell one exactly what relevant operators in the yang-mills theory
would drive a ow to this xed point in the infra-red. moreover, constructing the
supergravity kink solutions that interpolate between these ads ground states should be
equivalent to constructing explicitly the renormalization group ow [5, 6, 3]. thus, in
a very real sense, the supergravity potential should map out the phase diagram of the
n = 4 yang-mills theory under mass perturbations.

in [2] the critical points of supergravity potential with at least su(2) invariance
were classied. the results are summarized in table 1. from the work of [13] one can
deduce that the central charge at the new infra-red xed point is related to the central
charge at the uv xed point according to:

cir = (cid:18) ir

u v (cid:19)3/2

cu v ,

(2)

where  denotes the cosmological constant of the corresponding ve-dimensional
supergravity solution.

to be a stable solution of the supergravity theory the solution must either be
supersymmetric [14] or the small oscillations must satisfy the breitenlohner-freedman
(bf) condition [15]. if there are supergravity modes that fail the bf-condition then
the corresponding yang-mills operators seem to have complex conformal dimension,
violating unitarity, and so corresponding phases appear to be pathological. the stability

5

analysis for the so(5) point was done in [6], and the instability of the other non-
supersymmetric points was established by pilch [16].

it thus seems that only the last critical point represents a viable, non-trivial phase
of large n yang-mills theory. it is, of course natural to ask whether this should also
represent a phase at nite n, and the ads/cft correspondence implies that this
question is equivalent to asking whether the supergravity solution is a good vacuum
for the iib string. the general dogma in this area states that this is true for n = 4
supersymmetric supergravity solutions, and suggests that there should be a string
vacuum nearby for n = 2 supersymmetric supergravity solutions. thus nding a
corresponding yang-mills phase represents a very non-trivial, non-linear test of the
ads/cft correspondence (and of the general dogma about supersymmetric solutions).

table 1: the su(2) invariant critical points of the n = 8 supergravity potential.

from the supergravity scalar vevs at this non-trivial, supersymmetric critical point
one nds that in the n = 4 yang-mills theory one is turning on a mass for one of
the four fermions, and two of the six scalars. indeed, writing everything in terms of
n = 1 superelds, one sees that this new phase arises from giving a mass to exactly
one of the three adjoint hypermultiplets. based upon this, several authors [17, 3] have
identied this infra-red phase as precisely one of those discovered by leigh and strassler
in 1995 [18]. the global symmetries, supersymmetry, the uv end of the ow, the
central charge and the ir anomalous dimensions have all been checked, and the match
is perfect. of course, once one has established the existence of such a phase, a number
of the properties, like anomalous dimensions, follow as a consequence of the n = 1
superconformal symmetry. however, the remarkable thing is that supergravity knows
about the existence of the xed point, and that it requires the extremely non-linear
structure of the potential to see it. conversely, had supergravity not found this xed
point, it would have cast signicant doubt on the ability of ads/cft to go beyond the
most basic, second order perturbative details.

3. renormalization group flows

6

3.1. the n = 1 ow

consider now the supergravity scalars 1, 2, that are dual to the mass parameters of
a fermion and the two scalar elds that constitute an n = 1 yang-mills hypermultiplet.
on this subsector one can write the supergravity potential in the canonical form:

3

w

2

g2

g2
3

v =

|w |2 ,

j(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

xj=1 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
42 h cosh(21) (6  2)  (36 + 2)i ,
2. the scalar kinetic term has the usual form: 1

w =

(3)

(4)

where

and   e

1
6

2 pj g(j)(j).

the n = 8 supersymmetric critical point is at j  0, and there is a zz2 equivalent

pair of n = 2 supersymmetric critical points at:

1 =  1

2 log(3) , 2 = 1
6

log(2) .

(5)

to construct the kink corresponding to the renormalization group ow one requires

the ve-metric to take the form:

ds2 = e2a(r)dxdx  dr2 .

(6)

(i will adopt the conventions of [3] throughout.) as r   the scalars, j, must vanish
and one must have a(r)  const. r so that the background is asymptotic to the n = 8
supersymmetric ads background at innity. at the other end of the ow (r  ), the
scalars must approach either of the critical values (5), and once again a(r)  const. |r|
as one approaches the new conformal xed point.

since the ow is n = 1 supersymmetric one should be able to nd a ve-dimensional
kink that preserves this amount of supersymmetry. the equations of motion for such
a ow can be obtained by nding solutions to the vanishing of the supersymmetry
variations of the supergravity fermions: a
 = 0, abc = 0. from this one can show
that there is a supersymmetric ow if and only if:

dj
dr

=

g
2

w
j

,

and

a(r) = 

g
3

w .

(7)

these equations mean that the ow is determined by the steepest descent of the
superpotential, and that the cosmology (a(r)) is determined directly from this steepest
descent.

figure 1 shows the contour maps of the potential v , and the superpotential, w .
these functions have a zz2 symmetry under 1  1, and thus there are two equivalent
copies of each non-trivial critical point. the contour map of v shows ve critical points
corresponding to the rst, third and fth entries in table 1. critical points of w yield

supersymmetric vacua, and figure 1 also shows these as well as a steepest descent path.
note that the steepest descent path has a parabolic form near the central critical point:

7

2  s8

as r   .

(8)

this is, of course, precisely what one needs for the yang-mills scalar masses to be the
square of the yang-mills fermion mass along the supersymmetric ow.

3.2. the c-function

if one wishes to describe a general renormalization group ow in terms of holography
then one considers a ve-metric of the form (6) with some ve-dimensional matter on
the brane. it is relatively elementary to show [3] that if the energy-momentum tensor
of this matter satises the null energy condition then that the following function is a
c-function for the ow:

c(r) =

c0

(a(r))3 ,

(9)

where c0 is a suitably chosen constant.

specically, c(r) is monotonic decreasing along renormalization group ows to the
infra-red. it is only stationary at conformal xed points of the ow, and by proper choice
of c0 the function c(r) is equal to the central charge of the conformal theory at any

8

xed point. for the ows of n = 4 yang-mills considered earlier, one sets c0 = g3n 2/32,
which gives c = a = c = n 2
4 at the n = 4 supersymmetric point. the same c-function
and a restricted version of the c-theorem was also obtained in [5].

interestingly enough, for the supersymmetric ows one can use (7) to obtain:

c(r) = 

27
g3

c0
w 3 ,

(10)

where w is the superpotential. this form of the c-function is much more in the spirit
of zamolodchikovs (1 + 1)-dimensional c-function in that it is explicitly written as a
function of the couplings, whereas (9) only has an implicit dependence on the couplings.
it is also interesting to note that the renormalization group ows (7) also represent
steepest descents of the c-function (10).

4. flows to hades and the coulomb branch

in the previous section i considered a very specic ow that follows a ridge line of the
superpotential (4) to the non-trivial xed point. however, any solution to (7) represents
a supersymmetric solution to the ve-dimensional supergravity theory:
indeed figure
2 shows a family of supersymmetric ows superimposed on the contours of w . it is
evident that all the ows (other than the ridge-line ow) go to innite values of the
scalar elds, and thus to innite values of w (called hades by one of my illustrious
collaborators). since these ows are part of the supergravity theory, and have some
interpretation in terms of perturbations of the gauge theory at its uv xed point, it
would seem that all these ows should also have some gauge theoretic interpretation.
however instead of tackling this problem directly, i will consider a larger, but simpler
family of ows to hades; a family that includes the ows along the horizontal axis in
figure 2.

consider all the supergravity scalars in the 20 of so(6). these are naturally
parametrized by a matrix s  sl(6, ir)/so(6), and on this subsector the potential and
superpotential have the form:

g2

v = 

32 h (tr(m))2  2tr(m 2) i ,

w = 

1
4

tr(m) ,

(11)

where m  sst . using the so(6) symmetry one can take m to have the form

m = diag(e21, e22, e23, e24, e25, e26), with pa a = 0. if j are orthonormal linear

combinations of the a, then once again one obtains supersymmetric solutions to the
supergravity theory if one satises (7). however, these solutions preserve n = 4
supersymmetry on the brane. one can also show that while the ows near the uv
xed point are generically complicated, far from the uv xed point the ows settle
down to one of ve classes:

9

the central critical point. each such path represents an n = 1 supersymmetric solution.

two so(4)  so(2) invariant ows dened by ~ = (1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2)
an so(3)  so(3) invariant ow dened by ~ = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

where  is a parameter. the corresponding ve-metrics are regular for the so(5) and
so(4)  so(2) invariant ows with  > 0 and the + choice. the regularity, and
physical interpretation of the corresponding ten-dimensional metrics will be discussed
in the talk by steve gubser.

from the yang-mills perspective, the scalars in the 20 of so(6) are dual to the last
set of operators in (1). however these supergravity scalars cannot correspond to turning
on masses since the ows described above all preserve the full n = 4 supersymmetry.
these supergravity scalars must therefore represent moduli of the n = 4 theory, and
indeed these ows must be along the coulomb branch. one can see this fact directly by
constructing the corresponding ten-dimensional metrics, and looking at the distribution
of branes that make up the sources (see [4], and the talk by s. gubser). more generally,
this situation raises the issue of when a supergravity scalar represents a mass term or a
eld theory modulus. the resolution of this was given in [11, 19], and there is a direct
characterization that can be expressed entirely from the ve dimensional perspective.

recall that a general (non-supersymmetric) ow in the supergravity scalar sector is

determined by a second order dierential equation:

d2j
dr2 + 4a(r)

dj
dr

=

v
j

.

(12)

near the uv critical point this equation has a general solution with asymptotic

10

behaviour:

j  aj re2r + bj e2r .

(13)

the rst of these modes is non-normalizable on the ads5, and so couples non-trivially
to operators on the boundary, and thus represents a mass insertion on the brane. the
second mode represents a normalizable wave-function on ads5, and thus must represent
a state in the hilbert space, which here means a modulus of the coulomb branch of
the n = 4 theory. thus a general ow can involve a mixture of mass terms and vevs.
the supersymmetric ows are determined by rst order equations (7), and they select
a unique solution, and one can easily check that the ows considered in this section
involve only normalizable modes (aj = 0 in (13)), whereas the n = 1 ow discussed
earlier has asymptotics (8), which manifestly involves non-normalizable modes.

thus even the apparently pathological ows to hades in the ve-dimensional
supergravity have a sensible physical interpretation on the brane. moreover the ve-
dimensional supergravity also captures the subtleties of operators and states in the
ads/cft correspondence.

5. final comments

as outlined in the introduction, the primary purpose here was to describe some
extremely non-trivial (and successful) tests of the ads/cft correspondence, and its
generalization to renormalization group ows. i also wished to highlight the utility of
ve-dimensional gauged supergravities as a tool for examining the non-linear structure of
eld theories on the brane, and to show how some ancient issues of gauged supergravity
theories have new relevance to holographic eld theories. i would like to conclude in a
similar spirit by raising some related, but as yet unresolved issues.

first, in the work that led up to [3, 4] we also found a broad family of n = 1
and n = 2 ows to hades. we are still looking at some of the details, but these ows
certainly represent combinations of massive and coulomb branch ows.

it is an empirical fact that supersymmetric ows appear to be governed by steepest
descent of a superpotential, w , and hence of the c-function. it is not clear how far this
can be generalized. specically, we have found a c-function for general ows, but it is
not written directly as a function of the couplings, and it is not known whether a general
rg ow is necessarily a steepest descent of this c-function. however, the recent results
of [20] suggest that some non-supersymmetric generalizations are indeed possible.

returning to ancient supergravity issues:

there are non-supersymmetric critical
points, and all the known ones are unstable. is this true in general, i.e. does stability
also imply supersymmetry? additionally, what is the signicance of the unstable critical
points for the eld theory on the brane? are they merely some large n pathology?

11

it would obviously be interesting to determine all critical points of the potential, or
nd some way of controlling the problem. for black hole solutions based on calabi-yau
compactications one nds the ow to the horizon induces a potential on the calabi-
yau moduli space, and that that potential selects certain natural arithmetic points
as attractors for the ow [21]. it would be interesting if there were some arithmetic
principle in e6(6) for classifying the critical points of the supergravity potential.

one last issue: it would be very interesting to nd supersymmetric ows similar to
those discussed here, but in which the dilaton runs. most particularly it would be nice
to do this with the recently discovered n = 1 ows of [22], and thereby obtain a ow to
pure n = 1 gauge theory with a running coupling.
