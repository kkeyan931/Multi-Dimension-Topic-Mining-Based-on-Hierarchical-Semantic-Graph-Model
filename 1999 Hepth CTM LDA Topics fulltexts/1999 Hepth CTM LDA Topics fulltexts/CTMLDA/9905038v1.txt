abstract
symmetry breaking boundary conditions for wzw theories are discussed. we de-
rive explicit formulae for the reection coecients in the presence of boundary
conditions that preserve only an orbifold subalgebra with respect to an involutive
automorphism of the chiral algebra. the characters and modular transformations
of the corresponding orbifold theories are computed. both inner and outer auto-
morphisms are treated.

1 introduction

our understanding of conformally invariant boundary conditions for two-dimensional conformal
eld theories and of their classication has recently improved enormously. such boundary
conditions allow to study string perturbation theory in the background of certain solitonic
solutions, so-called d-branes. they also possess applications in statistical mechanics, e.g. in
the description of impurities and percolation problems.

for non-trivial conformal eld theories, i.e. for string backgrounds that are not at, confor-
mal eld theory techniques have been applied successfully in those situations where only nitely
many primary elds occur. more precisely, these are cases where not only the bulk theory is
rational, but also the part ag of the bulk symmetry a that is not broken by the boundary con-
ditions is still the chiral algebra of a rational theory. the situation is particularly manageable
when ag is actually an orbifold subalgebra, i.e. a subalgebra of a that is left pointwise xed
by some group g of automorphisms. for the case when g is a nite abelian group, an explicit
description and classication of such boundary conditions has been established in [1, 2]. the
crucial ingredients in those investigations are the representations of the modular group, both
the one that is associated to the chiral conformal eld theory based on a and the one associated
to the orbifold chiral algebra ag.

the purpose of the present note is to exploit these novel results in the special case when
a is the chiral algebra of a wzw theory. in this case the theory ane lie algebras provides
a powerful tool to compute the relevant modular matrices. there are, however, also other
reasons to study this specic class of models. it has been conjectured [3] that the structure
constants of the classifying algebra for the boundary conditions of a given automorphism type
are given by the traces of the action of this automorphism on the spaces of chiral blocks. in
the case of wzw theories, techniques are available (see e.g. [4, 5]) that allow to test this
conjecture. moreover, wzw theories correspond to strings propagating on group manifolds;
thus they constitute the most directly accessible non-trivial generalization of strings propagating
in a at background. boundary conditions of wzw theories therefore present a convenient
testing ground for studying conjectures about the correspondence of geometric and algebraic
formulations of boundary conditions. while in the case of at backgrounds one deals with the
familiar neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions of free bosons (possibly supplemented
with a background eld strength), already in this modestly generalized situation the geometric
interpretation of boundary conditions, in particular of those which break bulk symmetries, still
remains to be claried.

as already mentioned, the analysis of the boundary conditions of our interest requires in
particular a rather detailed knowledge of the modular matrices of the orbifold theory. as
a consequence, we rst have to establish these data, which in itself constitutes a non-trivial
result.
in the technically more amenable case where the orbifold group g consists of inner
automorphisms, such orbifolds have been studied earlier [6]. in the present paper, we will also
determine the modular matrices for orbifolds by outer automorphisms. as it turns out, the
twisted sector of such orbifold theories is provided by integrable irreducible representations of
twisted ane lie algebras. as a simplication, here we restrict ourselves to the case of orbifolds
by involutions, i.e. to g = z2. but as a matter of fact our results on wzw orbifolds are already
sucient to extract also the reection coecients for more general symmetry breaking boundary

2

conditions.

once the modular matrices of the orbifold theory have been obtained, the results of [1, 2]
allow to read o the corresponding symmetry breaking boundary conditions rather directly. in
fact, we learn even more; by applying t-duality both in the bulk and to the boundary conditions
we can also describe boundary conditions that preserve all symmetries of the bulk theory, but
for a theory with non-trivial modular invariant in the bulk. our results cover in particular the
case of orbifolds by the charge conjugation automorphism. thus, by t-duality, we are able
to describe the boundary conditions that arise for the true diagonal torus partition function.
(typically, in the literature boundary conditions are considered for the charge conjugation
modular invariant [7, 3, 2]; see, however, [8, 9].)

the paper is organized as follows. we start in section 2 by summarizing the general struc-
ture of z2-orbifolds, with emphasis on the building blocks of the orbifold characters and their
modular transformations. section 3 contains the technical core of the paper. we establish the
techniques for dealing with arbitrary involutive automorphisms of the chiral algebra of a wzw
theory that leave the virasoro element xed, and compute the characters and modular matrices
for the orbifold of the wzw theory by such an automorphism. in section 4 these results are
combined with the information from [2] so as to determine the symmetry breaking boundary
conditions of the wzw theory. finally, an appendix collects some properties of twisted theta
functions.

2 z2-orbifolds

2.1 elementary consistency conditions

we study the orbifold theory of an arbitrary rational conformal eld theory by the z2-group
that is generated by an order-two automorphism

 : a  a ,

2 = id ,

(2.1)

of the chiral algebra a of the original theory. the chiral algebra of the orbifold theory is by
denition the subalgebra az2 of a that is left pointwise xed by . to give rise to a consistent
conformal eld theory, this orbifold subalgebra must again possess a virasoro element. con-
formal invariance of the boundary conditions requires in addition that the virasoro elements
of a and az2 actually coincide; thus we require that the automorphism  leaves the virasoro
element xed.

for any arbitrary automorphism  of a and any a-representation r also r   is a represen-
tation of a. as a consequence, associated with  there comes a bijection  between irreducible
representations of a that is dened by r  = r. since the orbifold chiral algebra ao only
contains elements that are invariant under , there are no observables in the orbifold theory
that could distinguish between r and r. these representations, even when they are in-
equivalent representations of the original chiral algebra a, will give equivalent representations
of ao. this identication is, however, not the only eect. rather, when r = r, then the
automorphism  is implemented by an automorphism of the a-module r, and the invariant
subspaces under this map constitute submodules for ao. as a consequence, one is faced with
the task to split these a-modules into submodules over ao. this way we arrive at a certain set

3

of irreducible ao-modules, but typically we do not get all of the irreducible ao-modules. the
ones which can be obtained by identifying and splitting a-modules constitute the untwisted
sector of the orbifold theory, while all other representations of ao are said to be in some twisted
sector. we remark that by denition the untwisted sector is closed under operator products,
but it is not closed under modular transformations. this very fact will enable us to determine
the twisted sector.

let us now specialize to the z2 orbifold obtained for the automorphism (2.1). we rst
consider the untwisted sector. there are two types of elds, which are distinguished by the
action of the orbifold group on the elds of the original theory they come from. more specically,
they dier in the size of the stabilizer subgroup

s := {  z2 |  = } .

(2.2)

when s = z2, then we call the primary eld  symmetric, while for s ={id}, we call 
non-symmetric. 1 for non-symmetric , the two elds on the z2-orbit {, } are isomorphic
modules of the orbifold chiral algebra. as a consequence, each non-symmetric orbit gives rise
to a single primary eld in the orbifold; we choose (arbitrarily) a representative  for each such
length-two orbit {, } and label the corresponding orbifold eld as (, 0, 0); its character is
simply
(2.3)

o(,0,0)( ) = ( ) .

in contrast, each symmetric eld  of the original theory, satisfying  = , gets split, thus
giving rise to two distinct elds in the untwisted sector of the orbifold; we label them as (, , 0)
with  {1}. their characters are to be obtained by a suitable projection, and accordingly
can be written as
(2.4)

o(,,0)( ) = 1

(0)
 (2 ))

2 (( ) +  1



with certain phases . at this point is just a denition of the expression 1

introduced for every symmetric eld; this denition implies in particular that

(0)

 that is hereby

(0)
 ( +2) = (t (0)

 )2 (0)

 ( )

with

(t (0)

 )2 = t o(,,0) = t ,

(2.5)

where t denotes the t-matrix of the original theory. also, the explicit introduction of the
phases  is not really necessary, but this will prove to be convenient later on; we take the
convention, though, to ascribe the value  = 1 to the phase for the vacuum primary eld .

we can also immediately present some s-matrix elements of the orbifold theory, namely
those for the s-transformation of the characters (2.3) coming from non-symmetric elds; they
are expressible through the s-matrix s of the original theory as

so(,0,0),(,0,0) = s, + s, ,
so(,0,0),(,,0) = s, ,
so(,0,0),( ,,1) = 0 .

(2.6)

here in the last line we introduced the notation ( , , 1) for the elds in the twisted sector of
the orbifold that come from the symmetric eld ; each symmetric eld gives rise to two such

1 in the case of permutation orbifolds, such elds have been called [10] diagonal and o-diagonal , respectively.

4

elds, distinguished by the value of  {1}, while there are no twisted elds coming from
non-symmetric elds .
in order for the result in the second line of (2.6) to be well-dened, i.e. independent on
whether one takes the representative  or  of a non-symmetric orbit, we need s, = s,
for every symmetric ; this is a condition that must be satised for every consistent orbifold
action. further, to have a consistent orbifold theory, so must be symmetric; this implies that
s,+s, = s,+s,, which together with the symmetry of the original s-matrix s implies
that the previous requirement generalizes to

s, = s,

(2.7)

for every . thus for every consistent z2-orbifold action, the induced map on the primaries
must have the property that (2.7) holds for all  and . moreover, in order for the orbifold
to furnish a conformal eld theory the automorphism  of the chiral algebra must keep the
virasoro algebra xed, which in turn implies that it maps the vacuum primary eld  to itself,
 = . these elementary results for the orbifold tell us in particular that

s,s,s

s,

=x

s,s,,s 

,

s,

,

which by the verlinde formula means that the fusion rules of the original theory satisfy

n



, = n 
, .

(2.8)

(2.9)

thus the map  constitutes an automorphism of the fusion rules. one should, however, be
aware of the fact that dierent automorphisms of the chiral algebra can give rise to one and
the same automorphism of the fusion rules; to give an example, we will see that every inner
automorphism of a wzw theory yields the identity map on the fusion rule algebra.

2.2 characters in the twisted sector

to be able to analyze also the characters in the twisted sector, additional structure is needed.
the characters in the twisted sector can be obtained by performing an s-transformation  7 1/
on the functions (0). the result can be written as a linear combination of character-like quan-
tities. in all cases known to us each of those is, up to an over-all power of q = exp(2i ), a
power series in q1/2, albeit not in q. each such series arises from the sum of characters of two
primary elds in the twisted sector, and the two characters will be obtained separately as the
eigenfunctions of the t-operation  7  +1.

therefore we demand that for every symmetric eld  there is another function

(1)


( ) ,

(2.10)

such that the following relations are obeyed.

the labels  are in one-to-one correspondence with the labels . (generically this one-to-one
in particular, in general one cannot dispense of

correspondence is, however, not canonical.
using two dierent kinds of symbols for the labels of the functions (0) and (1).)

5

the function (1)

the functions are eigenfunctions under t, i.e. we have

has non-negative integral coecients in its expansion in powers of q = exp(2i ).

(1)


( +1) = t (1)


(1)


( )

(2.11)

.

the s-operation connects the functions (0)

 and (1)

 . more precisely, there are unitary ma-

for some suitable phases t (1)


trices s (0) and s (1) such that

and

(1)


(0)

 ( 1

 ) =x
( 1
 ) = x

=

s (0)
, 

(1)

 ( )

s (1)
,

(0)

 ( ) .

(2.12)

(2.13)

this structure is present in all examples that are known to us. note that even when the labels
 and  take their values in the same set, the functions (0) and (1) are denitely not required
to coincide. thus even in this special situation there is no reason to require that the matrices
s (0) and s (1) are symmetric, though this will be the case in specic examples.

combining the conditions (2.11) and (2.12), we nd the characters in the twisted sector as

o( ,,1)( ) = 1

2 ((1)


( 
2 ) +  (t (1)


)1/2 (1)


(  +1

2 )) .

they transform under t as

o( ,,1)( +1) =  (t (1)


)1/2 

( ,,1)( ) ,

which determines the conformal weights (modulo integers) in the twisted sector,

t o( ,,1) =  (t (1)


)1/2 .

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

)1/2 is only dened up to a sign; it is to be understood as follows.
note that the square root (t (1)

for each value of  we make an arbitrary choice of the square root, and keep this choice xed
once and forever. a dierent choice would lead to the opposite assignment of the label . once
this choice has been made, elds with the same , but dierent values of , can be distinguished
unambiguously, because their conformal weights dier by 1/2 mod z.

we are now in a position to determine the rest of the s-matrix elements in the untwisted

sector. we obtain

so(,,0),(,,0) = 1
so(,,0),( ,,1) = 1
so(,,0),(,0,0) = 1

2 s, ,
2 1
2 (s, + s,) = s, .

 s (0)

,  ,

(2.17)

(the rst and third lines do not rely on our assumptions about the functions (1).)

for the modular s-transformation of the characters (2.14) we nd



( ,,1)( 1

 ) = 1

2x x=1

( s (1)
,

(,,0)( ) +  p , 

( ,,1)( )) ,

(2.18)

6

where p is the matrix

p := (t (1))1/2s (1)(t (0))2s (0)(t (1))1/2

(2.19)

(the symbol p is chosen in accordance with the notation for a similar matrix that appeared
in a dierent context in [11]). by the unitarity of the various matrices appearing here, p is
unitary as well. the precise form of the matrix p depends on our choice of square roots in
the denition of t o. but the result for the matrix so is independent of our choice of square
roots, because for a dierent choice we also must ip the labelling of characters, so that the
expression p ,  remains unchanged. from (2.18) we read o the remaining elements of the
modular matrix so of the orbifold:

so( ,,1),(,,0) = 1
= 1
so( ,,1),( ,,1)
so( ,,1),(,0,0)

= 0 .

,

2  s (1)
,
2  p ,  ,

(2.20)

thus in particular we have managed to express, based on only very general assumptions, the
matrix elements so( ,,1),( ,,1)
in the twisted sector in terms of other so-elements and data of
the original theory.

2.3 consistency conditions

in order for the orbifold construction to furnish a consistent conformal eld theory, the matrices
so and t o must possess the following properties:

symmetry :

unitarity :

(so)t = so ,
(so)1 = (so) ,

conjugation : co := (so)2 is an order-two permutation ,

(sot o)3 = (so)2 .

(2.21)

in addition, when inserting so into the verlinde formula, we must obtain non-negative integral
fusion coecients.

let us discuss the implications of the requirements (2.21) in some detail.

2.3.1 symmetry of so

to investigate the symmetry property of the matrix so, we compare its entry so(,,0),( ,,1) to
so( ,,1),(,,0). one sees that a necessary condition for symmetry of so is that

, = 2
s (1)

 s (0)

,  .

(2.22)

this relation is compatible with the unitarity of the matrices because the numbers  are
phases. it also allows us to rewrite p as

p = (t (1))1/2(s (0))t(1t (0))2s (0)(t (1))1/2 .

(2.23)

this is manifestly symmetric, which implies that (2.22) is also sucient for so to be symmetric.

7

2.3.2 unitarity of so and charge conjugation

the conditions that ensure that so is unitary and that the charge conjugation co = (so)2
is a permutation of order two are best studied together. for non-symmetric , straightfor-
ward calculation using the unitarity of s shows that (so(so))(,0,0),(,0,0) = (,0,0),(,0,0) and
(so(so))(,0,0),(,,g) = 0 are satised automatically. to determine the conjugation for non-
symmetric , we just use that  is a fusion rule automorphism and hence commutes with
charge conjugation; it follows that charge-conjugate -orbits give charge-conjugate elds in
the orbifold theory. (thus when  is itself charge conjugation, all elds (, 0, 0) of the orbifold
theory are selfconjugate.)

for symmetric elds, the desired result (so(so))(,,0),(,,0) = (,,0),(,,0) is obtained if

and only if s (0) and s (1) are related as

or equivalently,

s (0)
,  (s (1)

,) = 2

 , ,

s (1)
,

2
 (s (0)

, ) =  ,  .

as for charge conjugation, we obtain

co(,,0),(,,0) = 1

(2.27)

c (0)

,  = 1

  (s (0)s (1)), .

 x

thus charge conjugation in the orbifold is consistent only if it is possible to choose sign factors

in such a manner that

  {1}

(2.28)

(2.29)
for the twisted sector, we nd that (so(so))( ,,1),( ,,1) = ( ,,1),( ,,1) follows from uni-

, = c, .

c (0)

tarity of the p -matrix (2.19), while the charge conjugation is

with

co( ,,1),( ,,1) = 1

2 (c (1)

,  + (p 2) , )

c (1)

,  := x

=

s (1)
,

s (0)
,  .

(2.30)

(2.31)

we conclude that c (1) must be a permutation of order two; it is convenient to use c (1) to dene
a conjugation on dotted indices, which we denote by a superscript +. moreover, p 2 must be
the same permutation, up to a sign that can depend on :

(p 2) ,  =   c (1)

,  .

8

(2.32)

from (2.30) we then learn that

co( ,,1),( ,,1) = c (1)

,  ,  

.

(2.33)

we can determine the signs   from the requirement that a consistent conjugation relates elds
 )1/2
with identical conformal weight. the two conformal weights that have to coincide are (t (1)
and (t (1)

+)1/2 = (t (1)

+)1/2  , so that

  = (t (1)


)1/2/(t (1)

+)1/2 ,

which is indeed a sign, and which allows us to write

p 2 = (t (1))1/2c (1)(t (1))1/2 .

(2.34)

(2.35)

thus the presence of the signs   is due to the fact that we choose the two square roots for 
and + independently. as an easy consequence of the relation (2.34) we have

which in turn implies that the conjugation has order two.

we can summarize our results about charge conjugation as

 + =   ,

(, 0, 0)+ = (+, 0, 0) ,
(, , 0)+ = (+, , 0) ,
( , , 1)+ = ( +,  , 1) .

(2.36)

(2.37)

as a side remark, let us also mention that in every conformal eld theory, the requirements
that s2 = c and c 2 = 11 imply that s1 = sc, while the requirements that s is unitary and
symmetric imply that s1 = s; thus charge conjugation and complex conjugation of s-matrix
elements are related as si+,j = (si,j). let us check that this property is indeed satised for the
orbifold. when non-symmetric elds are involved, the property is obeyed trivially. from the
diagonal elements in the twisted sector we nd the condition

while the o-diagonal elements yield

p ,  =   p +,  ,

(s (0)

, ) = 2

 s (0)

, + = s (1)

+, ,

and

(s (0)

, ) = 1

+ s (0)

+, 

.

(2.38)

(2.39)

(2.40)

by unitarity of s (0) and by the denition of the conjugation in the twisted sector, these relations
are satised automatically.

9

2.3.3 the relation between so and t o

finally we demand that the modular group relation (sot o)3 = (so)2 holds or, equivalently,
that t osot o = sot oso =: xo. this is indeed the case; for xo(,0,0),( ,,1)
it is immediate
(these matrix elements are zero), and for xo(,0,0),(,0,0) it follows directly from (st )3 = s2. for
xo( ,,1),( ,,1)
, validity of the condition is checked by also using that (t (0))2 = t , while for
xo(,0,0),(,,0) and xo(,0,0),(,,0), one has to employ the identity

which is a consequence of t o( ,,1)
both untwisted symmetric and twisted elds, one has to compare

. finally, for mixed matrix elements involving

,  t o( ,,1) s (1)
s (0)

, = 0 ,

x=1x
=t o( ,,1)

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.44)

(t osot o)(,,0),( ,,1) = 1

2  1

to

equality holds if and only if

s (0)(t (1))1/2p = t 1s (0)(t (1))1/2 ;

using the denition of p , this is in turn equivalent to the identity (2.35). we conclude that the
requirement (sot o)3 = (so)2 does not lead to any new constraints on so or t o.

2.3.4 collection of the results

we summarize the ndings above by the statement that the consistency conditions (2.21) for
the matrices so and t o are equivalent to the following set of properties of the matrices s (0),
s (1) and t (1):

(i)

is unitary ,

s (0)
, = 2
, := 1

(ii) s (1)

(iii) c (0)

 s (0)
, 

,

  (s (0)s (1)), = c, ,

(2.45)

(iv) c (1)

,  := (s (1)s (0)) ,  =

(t (1)
(t (1)

)1/2

 )1/2

(p 2) ,  .

here p is dened by (2.19); also, the numbers  must all be 1, and c (1) must be a permutation
of order two. the requirement (iv) actually consists of two conditions, namely that s (1)s (0) is a
permutation of order two, and that up to signs (which are, however, uniquely determined) p 2
is that same permutation; also, (iv) is the only condition that constrains the conformal weights
in the twisted sector.

we now draw further conclusions from the constraints (2.45). first, using unitarity of s (0)

and s (1), we get from condition (iv) that

s (0)
, + = (s (1)
,

)  2

 (s (0)

, ) ;

(2.46)

10

this can be regarded as an analogue of simple current symmetries [12] of s-matrices. second,
combining conditions (ii) and (iii) with the unitarity of s (1), we learn that

,+ = 1
s (1)

+ 1

  (s (1)

,) .

in particular, the relation

is equivalent to having

s (1)
,+ = (s (1)

,)

 = + .

(2.47)

(2.48)

(2.49)

in this latter case it follows e.g. that for every selfconjugate  the number 2
 is a sign. (in par-
ticular, when  is itself charge conjugation, so that we are dealing here only with selfconjugate
, then 2

 =1 in full generality.)

2.4 fusion rules

the fusion rules of the orbifold are expressible through so via the verlinde formula. by direct
computation we arrive at the following results. first, there is the expected twist selection rule

no

( 3, 3,g3)
( 1, 1,g1),( 2, 2,g2)

= 0 for g1+g2+g3 = 1 mod 2 .

(2.50)

here we introduced the convention that  can take the values 1 for g = 1, while for g = 0 the
allowed values are 1 for symmetric elds, but 0 for non-symmetric ones.
also, in the untwisted sector we nd linear combinations of the original fusion rule coe-
cients as long as non-symmetric elds are involved:

no

no

no

(1,0,0),(2,0,0)

(3,0,0)

(3,,0)

(3,3,0)

1,2 + n 3

1,2

3

= n 3

1,2 + n

3
1,2 ,

= n 3
1,2 .

,

(2.51)

in particular, in these cases the fusion rules of the orbifold theory are manifestly non-negative
integers. note that only fusion rule coecients of the original theory appear; this is due to
the fact that when at least one non-symmetric eld involved, then the twisted sector does not
contribute to the verlinde sum. a more interesting case is the remaining one in the untwisted
sector, which is

no(1,1,0),(2,2,0),(3,3,0) = 1

2 (n1,2,3 + 123 (123)1 n(0)

1,2,3)

(2.52)

(2.53)

with

n(0)

1,2,3 :=x

s (0)
1, s (0)
2, s (0)
3, 
s (0)
, 

.

11

these coecients tell us how the chiral blocks of the original theory split under the orbifold
action. in the case of z2-permutation orbifolds [10], this just amounts to symmetrization or

antisymmetrization of the blocks, so that there is an immediate formula for the numbers n(0).
in general, we encounter the following structure. an action of the orbifold group can not only
be dened on the a-modules, but also on the spaces of chiral blocks of the a-theory. (using the
description of chiral blocks in terms of co-invariants, see e.g. [4, 5], this can be made explicit
in the case of wzw theories.) the expression appearing in formula (2.53) is then the trace of
this action or, to be more precise, since this action is only dened up to a sign, the dierence of
the contributions from the two invariant subspaces. notice that the form of (2.53) is precisely
the one that is familiar from the verlinde formula. we would also like to point out that simple
current symmetries can be implemented in a similar way on the spaces of chiral blocks [13]; in
that case a formula for the traces has been conjectured that is of verlinde form as well, but
with the matrix s (0) in the denominator of (2.53) replaced by s [13].

and hence is a simple current of order two. it has integral conformal weight, and the extension
of the orbifold theory by this simple current simply reproduces the original theory. upon
extension, orbifold elds coming from symmetric elds of the original theory form full orbits,
whereas the elds coming from non-symmetric elds are xed points which need to be resolved,
thus giving rise to a pair of non-symmetric elds. the virtue of this simple relationship is
that it provides us with two distinct descriptions of one and the same situation  a pair of
theories with respective chiral algebras a and ao a. comparison of the two descriptions
often simplies the analysis of this situation. this was instrumental in the investigation of
boundary conditions in [1, 2], e.g. when discussing the relationship between boundary blocks
(i.e., chiral blocks for one-point functions of bulk elds on the disk) and boundary states.

3 wzw orbifolds

in this section we apply the general results of section 2 to the case where the original theory
is a wzw theory based on some untwisted ane lie algebra g. in this situation every auto-
morphism of the full chiral algebra a, which for our present purposes is the semi-direct sum
of g and the virasoro algebra, is completely determined by its restriction  to g. moreover, of
particular interest in applications are those cases where this automorphism  comes from an
automorphism of the horizontal subalgebra g of g g(1). in the case of interest to us here, i.e.
orbifolds, this restriction is mandatory because the automorphism must act as the identity on
the virasoro algebra and hence must preserve g; accordingly here we consider this particular
kind of automorphisms of g. also, in order to make contact with the discussion in section 2 we
require  to have order two, i.e. generate a z2-group. for the case of inner automorphisms,
wzw orbifolds with respect to more general nite orbifold groups have been discussed in [6].
in the present paper we use the techniques developped in [14, 15] which allow us to deal also
with the case of outer automorphisms. there are two reasons to expect that in the case of an
outer automorphism of g = g(1) the twisted sector can be understood in terms of the twisted
ane lie algebra g(2). to compute the traces in the untwisted sector, we will use the theory
of twining characters and orbit lie algebras as introduced in [14], and in the case at hand
the latter are twisted ane lie algebras. modular transformation of these traces yields again
characters of twisted ane lie algebras, although not necessarily of the same twisted ane lie
algebra that is relevant to the untwisted sector. the fact that the modules of twisted ane
lie algebras furnish the states of the twisted sector can, of course, also be understood from the
fact that the latter provide twisted representations of the chiral algebra a in the sense of [16].

3.1 automorphisms

for simplicity, we denote the relevant automorphism of the nite-dimensional simple lie algebra
g again by . it is known [17, prop. 8.1] that for every automorphism  of g of nite order
there is a suitable cartan--weyl basis of g in which it can be written as

where  is a diagram automorphism, i.e. acts on the chevalley generators of g as

(ei) = e i , (f i) = f i , (h i) = h i

 =   s ,

(3.1)

(3.2)

13

(i = 1, 2, ... , r  rank g) with some (possibly trivial) symmetry  of the dynkin diagram of g,
while s is an inner automorphism

s = exp(2i adhs) ,

(3.3)

where hs  (s, h) is some element of the cartan subalgebra of g that satises (hs) = hs.
the latter property implies that the automorphisms  and s commute. it is not dicult to
see that every automorphism of the form (3.1) extends uniquely to an automorphism of the
untwisted ane lie algebra g = g(1), which acts like

(ei

(h i

n) = ()n e2i(s,(i))e i
n) = h i
n ,

(k) = k .

n , (f i

n) = ()n e2i(s,(i))f i
n ,

(3.4)

here (i) are the simple g-roots, k denotes the canonical central element of g, and  is a sign
dened by

(e) =  e ,

(3.5)

where  is the highest g-root. in particular, for s = 0 the generators coming from the additional
simple root (0) of g transform as

(e0) =  e0 , (f 0) =  f 0 , (h 0) = h 0 ;

(3.6)

for  = +1 this is nothing but the diagram automorphism of g that is obtained by the same
prescription as in (3.2) when one extends  in the natural manner, i.e. as 0 = 0. by direct
calculation, one nds that 3

 =(cid:26) 1 for g = a2n,  = c ,

1 else .

(3.7)

we identify the cartan subalgebra with the weight space and correspondingly call s the
shift vector that characterizes the inner automorphism s. the map  on the weight space
only depends on ; its action on the fundamental g-weights (i) reads

(i) = ( i) .

(3.8)

in particular, for inner automorphisms  the map  is the identity. we refer to g-weights
 that satisfy  =  as symmetric weights; e.g. according to the statements above the shift
vector s is symmetric,

s = s .

(3.9)

now the group of automorphisms of a nite-dimensional simple lie algebra is a real compact
lie group; its factor group modulo inner automorphisms is isomorphic to the center z(g) of the
universal covering group g whose lie algebra is the compact real form of g. moreover, every
element of the center z(g) can be obtained by exponentiation of an element of the coweight

3 the automorphism obtained by setting  to 1 in the exceptional a2n-case does not leave the virasoro

algebra invariant; it maps ln to (1)nln.

14

lattice q of g. as a consequence, the shift vector s is only dened up to a symmetric element
of the coweight lattice. the inequivalent shift vectors are characterized in theorem 8.6 of [17].
for  to have order two, 2s must be an element of the coweight lattice q, and hence
corresponds to a group element 2s = e2i2s in the center z(g). according to the results of
[12, 18] it therefore determines uniquely a simple current of the wzw theory based on g,
which we denote by j[s]. (but the shift vector s is not, in general, equal to 1/2 the co-minimal
fundamental weight that characterizes [19] the simple current j[s].) we also introduce the
monodromy charge

qj[s]() := () + (j[s])  (j[s]) mod z

(3.10)
of  with respect to the simple current j[s]. when multiplied with the order of j[s], qj[s]()
equals minus the conjugacy class of  with respect to that element 2s  z(g) that is obtained as
the exponential of the element 2s of the coweight lattice. thus the exponentiated monodromy
charge is given by

with

2 = sj[s],

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

the (conjugacy classes of) order-two automorphisms  of a complex nite-dimensional
simple lie algebras are uniquely characterized by their xed point algebra g, which is the
subalgebra of g that is left pointwise xed under . equivalently, these automorphisms are in
one-to-one correspondence to the real forms of these complex lie algebras. a complete list of
the latter can e.g. be found in table ii on p. 514 of [20]. it is straightforward (though lengthy)
to determine the corresponding diagram automorphisms and shift vectors. we summarize the
pertinent results in table 1. in table 1 we use the following notation. except for g = d4, c is
the unique non-trivial diagram automorphism of the relevant lie algebra, while for g = d4 it is
the diagram automorphism for which  exchanges the two spinor nodes of the dynkin diagram.
in all cases where the group of simple currents of the theory is cyclic, j stands for the generator
of this group that has highest weight k(1), except for g = cn, where the weight is k(n); for
dn we use the notation jv for the vector current, of highest weight k(1), which has order two
and whose monodromy charge distinguishes spinor and tensor representations, while js is the
spinor current, of highest weight k(n).

by comparing the results for the numbers (s, s) with the values [19] of the conformal di-

mensions (j) of simple currents, one nds that the identity

(j[s])/k = 2 (s, s) mod z

holds for all entries in table 1. together with the result (3.11) and the identity

qj(j) + qj() = 2 (j) mod z ,

this implies that

implementation of automorphisms

to be able to determine the characters of the orbifold, we have to know the action of the
automorphism  on the primary elds. to this end we implement  by suitable maps t 
on irreducible highest weight modules h of the ane lie algebra g. 4 they must satisfy the
twisted intertwining property t 
 for all x g. this requirement determines
them up to a scalar factor. one possible implementation is

  x = (x)t 



t 
 := exp(2i(s, h))t 



.

(3.17)



here t 
is the preferred implementation of the diagram automorphism, i.e. the one that acts
as the identity map on the highest weight space of h. 5 the inner part, exp(2i(s, h)), can
be regarded as the representation matrix r( [s]) of an element  [s] of the simply connected,
connected, compact lie group whose lie algebra is the compact real form of g. unlike 
itself, the twisted intertwiners (3.17) do not square to the identity map. rather (t 
 )2 acts on
h as a multiple ([s]
 is the number introduced in (3.12). an
implementation which does have order two is thus given by

 )2 id of the identity, where [s]

t 
 := ([s]

 )1 t 
 .

(3.18)

it should be realized that the requirement that the map t 
 has order two does not x it
uniquely, but leaves an over-all sign undetermined; in the prescription (3.18) we have xed this
ambiguity by requiring that the map acts as +id on the highest weight vector.

recall that [s]


2 is the monodromy charge with respect to the simple current j[s]; thus the
2 = exp(2i(2s, +)) = exp(2i(2s+, )) is the monodromy charge with respect to

number [s]
+
the inverse of that simple current, so the product of these two numbers is 1. it follows that

[s]
 := [s]

 [s]
+

(3.19)

is equal to 1.
our goal is now to compute the characters of the primary elds in the untwisted sector
of the orbifold. while the identication of pairs of non-symmetric elds does not pose any
problem, in the symmetric case we need to get a handle on the eigenspaces of the action of t 
on the modules having symmetric highest weight. using the projectors



on the eigenspaces, where  takes the values 1, the characters of the orbifold primaries in the
untwisted sector are

1 +  t 



(3.20)

2 trh(1 +  t 

(,,0)(, z) = 1
4 by a slight abuse of notation, we use the symbol  both for a highest weight of g and for a highest weight
of g. this is justied by the fact that (as in any application to conformal eld theory) we work at a xed
non-negative integral value of the level of the g-modules, so that the g-weight uniquely determines its ane
extension.

 are known [14] as twining characters for

in the case of diagram automorphisms, the twining characters have been computed in [14,
15]. it has been proven that, upon correctly adjusting its arguments, the twining character
coincides with the ordinary character of some other lie algebra, which is called the orbit lie
algebra. one key ingredient in the proof of this assertion was the observation that the subgroup
of the weyl group of g that commutes with the action of the automorphism on the weight space
is isomorphic to the weyl group of the orbit lie algebra. the orbit lie algebra is a kac--moody
algebra of the same type as the original algebra. thus in the case at hand, it is still an ane lie
algebra, albeit no longer necessarily an untwisted one; indeed it is a twisted ane lie algebra
precisely if the automorphism  of g is outer. the appearance of twisted ane lie algebras for
those twining characters will imply, after modular transformation, that the twisted sector of the
orbifold theory is controlled by the representation theory of a twisted ane lie algebra. this
does not come as a surprise, since twisted ane lie algebras provide twisted representations
for untwisted ane lie algebras. for inner automorphisms the orbit lie algebra coincides with
g, so in particular its horizontal subalgebra is just the horizontal subalgebra g of g. for the
outer automorphisms the horizontal subalgebra of the orbit lie algebra is cn for g = a2n, bn+1
for g = a2n+1, cn1 for g = dn and f4 for g = e6.

3.3 weyl groups and lattices
as we will see below, for orbifolds with respect to inner automorphisms, the weyl group w
of g plays an analogous role for the twining characters as it does for the characters of the
original wzw theory. in contrast, in the outer case, where the map  on the weight space is
non-trivial, this role is taken over by the commutant

w := { w  w | w =  w}

(3.23)

of  in w . this subgroup w can be described more explicitly as follows. the weyl group w
has the structure w = w  l of a semi-direct product of the weyl group w of the horizontal
subalgebra g with the coroot lattice l of g. thus every element w  w can be uniquely written
as
(3.24)
for some   l, where t stands for translation by ; conversely, all these maps are in the weyl
group w . now since  is also an automorphism of g, the product w := ()1w is again an
element of w . moreover,  restricts to an automorphism of the coroot lattice l, and hence

w = w  t

w   = w  t   =   w  t()1 .

(3.25)

as the decomposition (3.24) is unique, this implies that  commutes with w if and only if
w = w and  = . it follows that w is the semi-direct product

w = w

 l


18

(3.26)

of the symmetric part l

 of the coroot lattice of g with the group

w := {w  w | w = w} .

(3.27)

it is known [14, 15, 21] that w is a coxeter group; we will denote by  its sign function. in
fact, w is nothing but the weyl group of the orbit lie algebra [14, 15] of the nite-dimensional
simple lie algebra g.

a general element of l

 is of the form 6

r

xi=1

ni(i) with ni  z and n i = ni

for all i .

(3.28)

in other words, the basis elements of l
 are associated to orbits of , and for length-1 orbits
the basis element is just (i), while for length-2 orbits it is (i)+ ( i). by computing the inner
products between these basis vectors, we nd that these lattices are just scaled root lattices,
as listed in the following table.

table (3.29) also provides another set of lattices, denoted by l

; they are constructed in
the following manner. the lattice l
 is the symmetric (i.e. pointwise xed) sublattice of the
coroot lattice l. we will also need the symmetric sublattice of l, which we denote by l.
when  is non-trivial, then unlike l and l themselves, these are no longer dual to each
other. rather, the dual lattice l of l
 is a lattice that contains the symmetric weight lattice
l as a sublattice, while the dual lattice ( l) =: l
 contains the symmetric coroot lattice
l
; thus

  l

l  l .

all these lattice have the same rank, which we denote by r. denoting the length of the -orbit

the isomorphisms

isomorphism between a nite abelian group and its dual group), which implies in particular
that

(they are not isomorphisms of lattices; e.g. they are not isometries). since the elements of the
weyl group w of g preserve the weight lattice l as well as the coroot lattice l, it follows
that the elements of w preserve both l and l
. moreover, as elements of w , they are
manifestly isometries, and hence they also preserve the dual lattices l
 and l. in short,
for all the lattices (3.31) the elements of w are lattice-preserving isometries. further, the
action of w, and hence also of w
 for any h z>0  and similarly also the action
  partitions the symmetric subspace of the weight space of g into chambers. in

order to account for this feature, we introduce the following notation. the orbit spaces for the

important role. we denote them by

p ++

:= (p +

and

p ++

k

:= ( p +

(3.40)

where for later convenience we have shifted the index by the dual coxeter number g of g.

in the case of undotted weights, natural representatives for p +

exist:

notice that in general it is not true that p ++
) (the latter does hold,
however, when the map f commutes with the action of w which, besides the trivial case
where  is inner, happens if and only if g = a2n). but we will see later (see formula (3.56)
below) that the set p ++
is closely related to the set of integrable weights of twisted ane lie
algebras.

indeed holds true:

3.4 twisted characters

we are now ready to introduce the relevant twisted characters that appear as constituents of
the orbifold characters. they are functions which generalize the ordinary characters of ane
lie algebras, and accordingly they depend on two arguments, a number  in the upper complex
half plane and an element z of the weight space lz
r of g, as well as on two parameters,
a non-negative integer h and an element of the relevant dual lattice, that is,  l and
 l, respectively. in addition they depend on two further parameters, the twist parameters

r. the ordinary g-characters are recovered when s1 = 0 = s2 and when the relevant
lattice is the ordinary coroot lattice l of g.

the ordinary characters  can be written as quotients of functions +,k+g and ,g,
which in turn are odd weyl sums over theta functions for the lattice l [17]. similarly, the
twisted characters are given by

 [s1, s2](, z) := 


+,k+g[s1, s2](, z)/ 

,g[s1, s2](, z) ,

and


 [s1, s2](, z) := 

+ ,k+g[s1, s2](, z)/ 

,g[s1, s2](, z) ,

(3.43)

respectively. the functions  and  are the antisymmetrized (with respect to the sign

to the lattices l

 and l

e2i ( +hs1+h , +hs1+h )/2he2i(z+s2, +hs1+h ) .

(3.46)

various properties of the functions (3.46) and (3.45) are listed in appendix a. they give

rise to the following properties of the twisted characters (3.43) and (3.44).

we can restrict our attention to a fundamental domain of the action of w = w

l, respectively of w

 h l

 on l. thus we need to consider only characters with

 hl

 on

respectively.

for

(3.47)

(3.48)

where q is the coweight lattice of g.

the behavior under the t-transformation follows from the transformation properties (a.20)

of the -functions. for the functions  it reads

 [s1, s2]( +1, z) = eik(s1,s1) t 


 [s1, s1+s2](, z)

with

t := exp (2i[(+, +)/2(k+g) (, )/2g]) = exp(2i(  c/24)) .

(3.49)

(3.50)

here it is assumed that the condition (a.7) is satised, i.e. that (s1, ) z for all   l
in short, that

, or

this is indeed the case for all vectors s that appear in table 1, which will be the situation we
are actually interested in.
in the cases where l

, it is not an even lattice; as a consequence the -
characters do not transform nicely under the t-transformation. but they still do so under t2,
namely

:= exp (2i[( + , + )/2(k+g) ( , )/2g]) .

(3.53)

here again it is assumed that condition (a.7) is satised for s1, except for the case of g = a2n,
where the stronger restriction (a.11) applies.

for the behavior under the s-transformation we use the formulae (a.21) and (a.22) as well

as (a.27). introducing the matrix s with entries

we obtain

finally we point out that there is a close connection between the functions 

 [0, 0]( ) and
the characters  of the twisted ane lie algebra g(2). this is already apparent from the fact
that the lattices l
 as listed in table (3.29) are precisely 21/2 times the lattices that appear in
the weyl group of these twisted ane lie algebras (see remark 6.7. of [17]). closer inspection
shows that indeed we have

(, z) = 

/2[0, 0](2 ,2z) .

in particular, we learn that the coecients that appear in the expansion of 
of q are non-negative integers.

/2[0, 0] in powers

3.5 the orbifold data

we are now in a position to compare what we have learned about the twisted characters
 [s1, s2] and 

 [s1, s2]  in particular their modular properties  with the general results
about orbifolds that were presented in section 2. this way can identify the data that charac-
terize the wzw orbifold, i.e. the functions (0)
 and the associated modular matrices.
first of all, the labels  of symmetric elds as well as the labels  in the twisted sector are
precisely as dened above; in particular,  takes values in the set (3.41), i.e. is a symmetric
g-weight that is integrable for g at level k. further, let us choose the convention for the phases
 as introduced in (2.4) so as to match the phases [s]

 appearing in (3.12), i.e.

 and (1)

 := [s]

  exp(2i(s, ))

(3.57)

for every symmetric weight . also, for the moment we exclude the exceptional case of outer
automorphisms  = c of a2n, which will be treated afterwards. then the functions (0) that
describe the projection of symmetric elds in the untwisted sector are given by

 (2 ) = 
(0)

 [0, s]( )

(3.58)

23

while for the twisted sector, we have to set
( 
2 ) = 

(1)


(3.59)
with  the diagram automorphism and s the shift vector as listed in table 1. to be precise,
the latter identication is unique up to possibly a phase that could, however, be absorbed in
the denition of s (1). with the prescription given here, it follows from our general discussion
that the coecients of an expansion in q of the expression (3.58) are non-negative integers.

 [s, 0]( ) ,

in the exceptional a2n case, where  = c and s = 0, we must in addition account for the
minus sign (3.7) that is present in the automorphism (3.4) of the ane lie algebra a(1)
2n. this
sign amounts to a relative minus sign between contributions from even and odd grades, hence
we can immediately conclude that in place of (3.58) we now have

 (2 ) = t 1/2
(0)



c
 [0, 0]( + 1

2) .

(3.60)
for obtaining the analogue of (3.59), we need to express the s-transformed character (0)
 ( 2
 )
as a linear combination of characters in the twisted sector, i.e. as a linear combination of as
many power series in q1/2 as there are symmetric elds in the theory. when addressing this
task directly via the expression c
2), the calculations turn out to become clumsy.
however, the following observation can be employed to rewrite c in a much more amenable
manner. namely, the cn-modules that appear at the even and odd grades, respectively, of the
integrable highest weight modules of the twisted ane lie algebra a(2)
2n are distinguished by their
cn conjugacy class. it follows that a shift  7  + 1/2 in the argument of the a(2)
2n-characters,
and hence also of the twining characters c, can be undone by inserting the central group
in the case of a(2)
element corresponding to the conjugacy class into the trace.
2n-characters,
this group element is given by exp(2ihs) with s the cn-weight s = (n). translated to the
twining characters, this becomes exp(2ihs) with a2n-weight 7

 [0, 0]( 1

 + 1

thus we can rewrite (3.60) as

s := 1

4 ((n) + (n+1)) .

 (2 ) = c
(0)

 [0, s]( ) .

(3.61)

(3.62)

this is of the same form as the generic result (3.58); accordingly, in place of (3.59) we now have

to determine the matrices s (0) and s (1), we calculate

7 the factor of 4 arises because the identication between weight space and cartan subalgebra of cn that is

induced from the corresponding identication for a2n diers by this factor from the standard one.

(3.65)

in the case of the outer automorphism of a2n we must in addition include the appropriate shift
vector s that was introduced in (3.61) above. it is gratifying that according to the result (a.11)
this shift is precisely what is needed in order for (1) to transform nicely under the t-operation.
furthermore, in this exceptional case we can also use the simple relationship  = /2. we then

(3.66)

let us check that the consistency conditions (i) through (iv) of z2-orbifolds that we derived

in section 2 are indeed satised by these matrices.

concerning (i) we remark that the unitarity of s follows by precisely the same arguments

[17] as for the kac--peterson s-matrix of ane lie algebras.

the relation (ii) between s (0) and s (1) is manifest in (3.66).
to address property (iii) we start by computing the matrix elements (s(s)t),. this
is non-zero if and only if there is an element w  w such that w() =. this can only be
the longest element w
max of the weyl group of the (horizontal) orbit lie algebra. therefore we
need + = , where the conjugation is to be taken in the orbit theory. the sign introduced
by w
max cancels against the prefactors i for the same reason they do so in the kac--peterson
formula of the untwisted ane lie algebra that is based on the horizontal orbit lie algebra.
(the latter is not the ane orbit theory, which would be a twisted ane lie algebra; here only
properties of the weyl groups of the horizontal subalgebras matter.) thus

s (s)t = c  ,

(3.67)

where c  is the conjugation matrix of the orbit lie algebra. c  is in particular a permutation
of order two; inspection shows that c  simply coincides with the restriction of c to symmetric
elds, which in turn implies that

c (0)

, = 2

 c, .

(3.68)

(in fact, only when  is inner and charge conjugation outer, then c  is non-trivial, while in
all other cases c  is the identity permutation.) validity of property (iii) thus follows from
the fact that according to relation (3.19), 2
 is a sign. the notation for that sign in (3.19) was
chosen with hindsight; indeed, we simply have

 = [s]


25

(3.69)

for all symmetric weights .

to verify the rst relation of condition (iv), we insert the explicit form (3.54) of s to deduce

(s (1)s (0)) ,  = (1)(dr )/2

|w|

e2i(2s,)

(ww) w( + )+w( + +2(k+g)s) , 0 mod (k+g) l



.

(3.70)

xw,ww

now it follows immediately from the semi-direct product structure of w that for every w  w
and every  p +
 and a unique weyl group element
w  w, as well as a unique  p +

there exists a unique vector   (k+g) l

such that

k

denoting the weight  appearing here by +, it follows that

w( + ) = w( + +2(k+g)s+ ) .

moreover, by noticing that the square of the s-transformations acts on the arguments as
s2:  7  , z 7z and considering characters at z = 0, the sign can be seen to be +1. thus
indeed c (1) := s (1)s (0) is a permutation of order two.
finally, the second relation of (iv) follows from the fact that the element tst2stst2s of

psl(2,z) equals the element s2, so that

x

( p 2) ,   (, z) = (tst2stst2s)   (, z)

=  (,z) =x

c (1)
, 

 (, z) .

(3.73)

by the linear independence of the characters, this implies that p 2 = c (1), as required.

the results obtained above can be checked most directly in those cases where a dierent
formulation of the orbifold conformal eld theory is available. a class of examples where this
is the case is provided by certain conformal embeddings [22, 23]. one nds one innite series,
the embedding of so(n) at level 2 in su(n) at level 1 (n 3), and one isolated case, namely c4
at level 1, which is a special subalgebra of e6 at level 1.
the simplest among these is the rst member of the innite series, i.e. the embedding of
(a1)4 in (a2)1, which corresponds to the d-type modular invariant of the a1-wzw theory
at level 4.
in this case, the automorphism is the diagram automorphism of a2, which also
coincides with charge conjugation. there is a single symmetric primary eld, with highest
weight  = (0)  (0,0). its character can be written as the sum of two characters of a1 at level
4, 
( ). the orbifold chiral algebra is a1 at level 4; thus the twining
character must be the dierence of two a1-characters.
indeed, one can verify explicitly the
identity (0)(2 ) = su(2)
( ). performing an s-transformation of the a1-characters,
we then nd (1)( 
( ). we have checked explicitly this character identity,
too.

two other special situations concern inner automorphisms and charge conjugation. they

will be dealt with separately in the next two subsections.

26

3.6

inner automorphisms

in the case where the automorphism  = s is inner, many of our results simplify. let us
describe some of the simplications. first note that in the inner case the rank of the xed
point algebra equals the rank of g, rank gs = rank g. more importantly, the fact that  = id
immediately implies that in lattice sums we just deal with the ordinary coroot lattice, and the
relevant lattice symmetries are just given by the ordinary weyl group, i.e. we have

id = l
l

id = l ,

lid = lid = l ,

wid = w .

it follows in particular that the entries of t (1) now read

t (1)


= (eik(s,s)e2i(,s) t)2

,

(3.74)

(3.75)

where of course  . similarly, the matrix elements of s coincide with the corresponding
elements of the ordinary s-matrix of the original wzw theory, s
, = s,, and indeed (3.54)
then is nothing but the kac--peterson formula [17] for s.

this result implies in particular that in the case of inner automorphisms the number n(0)

1,2,3
that was identied with the dierence of the dimensions of the invariant subspaces under
the action of the automorphism on the chiral blocks is in fact equal to the fusion rules, i.e.
n(0)
1,2,3 = n1,2,3. indeed, using the explicit description of chiral blocks as co-invariants (see
e.g. [4, 5]), one veries that inner automorphisms of g act on the chiral blocks as multiples of
the identity.

the functions (0) and (1) are both just shifted versions of ordinary characters,

(0)
 (2 ) = [0, s]( ) ,

(1)


( 
2 ) = [s, 0]( ) .

thus the orbifold characters coming from symmetric elds read

(,,0)(, z) = 1
(,,1)(, z) = 1

2 ([0, 0](, z) +  [s]
2 ([s, 0](, z) +  [s]

 1 [0, s](, z)) ,
 1e2ik(s,s) [s, s](, z)) .

(3.76)

(3.77)

let us also mention that in the inner case it can be seen rather directly that the shifted
characters [s, 0] are the correct quantities for the twisted sector. namely, there exists a
continuous family {v} of shift automorphisms of the semi-direct sum of the ane lie algebra
g and the virasoro algebra [24, 25, 26], depending on a vector v in the cartan subalgebra of g
and acting as

n) = h i
n ) = e

v(h i
v(e
v(ln) = ln + (v, hn) + 1

n + vikn,0 ,
n+(,v) ,

v(k) = k ,

2 (v, v)kn,0 .

noticing that

this implies that

[s, 0](, z) = e2ik(z,s)e2i k(s,s)/2 [0, 0](, z+ s) ,

[s, 0](, z) = trhe2i (s(l0))e2i(z,s(h0)) .

27

(3.78)

(3.79)

(3.80)

in words, the shifted character with shift [s, 0] is precisely the character for the s-twisted
action of the ane lie algebra. this conrms in particular once more that the coecients in
the expansion of [s, 0](, z=0) in powers of q are non-negative integers.

charge conjugation in the untwisted sector is given by

c (0)

, = [s]

 2 c, ,

(3.81)

while with the help of the simple current symmetry (3.13) of the s-matrix, we nd that the
charge conjugation in the twisted sector reads

finally we mention that in the case of inner automorphisms the matrix p as dened in formula
(2.19) diers from s just by phases. namely, using (3.75) we have

c (1)

, = c,j[s] .

(3.82)

using (st )3 = s2 and again the simple current relation (3.13), it follows that

p = e2ik(s,s) [s]t s([s])2t st [s] .

p, = ([s]

 [s]

 )1 e2ik(s,s) s, .

(3.83)

(3.84)

3.7 charge conjugation

an order-two automorphism that is present in any arbitrary conformal eld theory, and hence
is of particular interest, is charge conjugation. in the wzw case this comes from the charge
conjugation automorphism of the relevant nite-dimensional simple lie algebra g. data for
these special automorphisms are listed in the following table:

in the charge conjugation case the relevant real form of g is the compact real form, and
we have dim g = 1
2 (dim g  rank g). a quantity that we encounter in this case is the frobe-
nius--schur indicator of an irreducible representation of g, respectively [27] of a primary eld
of the wzw theory. by denition, this is the number  that takes the value  = 0 for non-
selfconjugate irreducible representations, while in the selfconjugate case it distinguishes between
orthogonal (real) irreducible representations, for which  = 1, and symplectic (pseudo-real)
irreducible representations, which have  =1. we observe that in all cases where symplectic
irreducible representations occur, i.e. for g one of

a4+1 , b4+1 , b4+2 , cr , d4+2 , e7 ,

the value of the frobenius--schur indicator is given by

where c is the integer

 = (1)c ,

c := 2  [(2s, ) mod z ] .

(3.86)

(3.87)

(3.88)

inspection shows that for all algebras g for which charge conjugation is inner (so that all
representations are selfconjugate), c coincides with the conjugacy class of the g-weight ,
which in turn is twice the monodromy charge of  with respect to the simple current j[s],

c = 2 [() + (j[s])  (j[s]) mod z ] .

(3.89)

note that in all these cases j[s] has order 2, i.e. (j[s])2 = 1, and cj[s] = c.

in particular we see that the quantity  that was introduced in section 2 is in this case just
the exponentiated conjugacy class; it therefore coincides with the frobenius--schur indicator.
on the other hand, the general results of section 2 imply that each of the two elds (, +1, 0)
and (,1, 0) is self-conjugate if  = 1, while they are each others conjugate if  =1. this
is intuitively clear, since in the latter case the module of the original theory is symplectic and
should be split by charge conjugation into two modules of the orbifold chiral algebra with
identical virasoro-specialized character.

4 boundary conditions

in [1, 2] a general prescription has been obtained by which one can determine the set of confor-
mally invariant boundary conditions that preserve a given subalgebra ag of the chiral algebra
a, for the case when ag is the xed point subalgebra with respect to a nite abelian orbifold
group g. in the particular case where the orbifold group is just g = z2, many of the results of
[1, 2] simplify enormously. let us present some of those results in the form in which they arise
in this specic situation.

the conformally invariant boundary conditions preserving az2 =: a are in one-to-one cor-
respondence with the one-dimensional irreducible representations of a certain nite-dimensional
semisimple associative commutative algebra c(a), called the classifying algebra. this algebra
has a distinguished basis whose elements are in one-to-one correspondence with the chiral blocks
for the one-point correlation functions of bulk elds on the disk. let us start by describing

29

this basis in detail for the case of interest to us. according to the results of [1, 2], it looks
as follows. each orbifold eld (, 0, 0) that comes from a pair of non-symmetric elds of the
original theory gives rise to two basis elements, which we label as



and 

(6= ) ,

(4.1)

while each untwisted orbifold eld (, , 0) that comes from a symmetric eld yields a single
basis element, which we simply denote by

(,) with   {1}

( = ) .

(4.2)

fields in twisted sectors of the orbifold, on the other hand, do not correspond to any element
of c(a).
as already mentioned, to each element  in the basis of the classifying algebra there corre-
sponds a boundary block (i.e., a chiral block for the one-point functions of bulk elds on the
disk); we denote this chiral block by . for non-symmetric elds ,  is the ordinary boundary
block (also known as ishibashi state) of the original wzw theory, while for symmetric  we
get two distinct boundary blocks (,). the regularized scalar products of these boundary
blocks are given by the characters of the orbifold theory:

= , (2 ) ,

h | ql01+1l0c/12 | i
h | ql01+1l0c/12 | (,)i
h (,)| ql01+1l0c/12 | (,)i = , ,  1

= 0 ,

2 ((2 ) +  

(2 )) .

(4.3)

here 
 =   s into its diagram and inner parts (see formula (3.1)), 
(3.43) with s1 = 0 and s2 = s.

 is the twining character for the automorphism ; decomposing this automorphism as
 is given by the expression

next we list the boundary conditions that preserve the orbifold chiral algebra. according
to [1, 2] they can be labelled by orbits with respect to the simple current (,1, 0) of the
orbifold, including multiplicities that take into account how this simple current acts by the
fusion product. in the untwisted sector, the full orbits of this action are {(, 1, 0), (,1, 0)},
and each such orbit gives rise to a single boundary condition, which we label by . the xed
points are {(, 0, 0)}; each of them provides us with two distinct boundary conditions, which
we label by  and . the twisted sector supplies us with additional boundary conditions.
all orbits in the twisted sector have length two, i.e. they are of the form {( , 1, 1), ( ,1, 1)};
accordingly each of them amounts to a single boundary condition, which we label by . thus
altogether the list of boundary conditions reads

for {(, 1, 0), (,1, 0)} ,



 (cid:27) for {(, 0, 0)}





for {( , 1, 1), ( ,1, 1)} .

the structure constants are most conveniently expressed in terms of a certain matrix s
which, roughly, connects the boundary blocks to the boundary conditions. this matrix has two

30

(4.4)

distinct types of labels; the row index refers to boundary blocks, while the column index refers
to boundary conditions. in the case at hand, we obtain

s(,), = s,
s(,),  = 1

,  ) for  =  ,

 s (0)

s, = s,

s,  = 0 ) for 6=  .

(4.5)

here s (0) is determined by the formulae (3.66) and (3.54) of section 3; it depends only on the
class of the automorphism  modulo inner automorphisms and reads explicitly

s (0)

,  := n i(dr )/2 xww

(w) e2i(w(+), + )/(k+g) .

(4.6)

here w is the weyl group of the horizontal subalgebra of the orbit lie algebra and  is
its sign function; d and r are the dimension and the rank of this horizontal lie algebra.
we also recall that for inner automorphisms the horizontal subalgebra of the orbit lie algebra
coincides with the horizontal subalgebra g of g; for the outer automorphisms it is given by cn
for g = a2n, bn+1 for g = a2n+1, cn1 for g = dn and by f4 for g = e6. finally n is the real
positive number which is determined by requiring s (0) to be unitary.
having obtained the matrix s, the structure constants of the classifying algebra c(a) are

computed by the verlinde-like formula

where the symbol m stands either for an orbit m =  (with multiplicities) in the untwisted

here the normalization c m := s(,1),m ensures the correct normalization of the vacuum boundary
eld.

the boundary conditions come in two sets, corresponding to two automorphism types [3].
we rst comment on the ones labelled by m = .
in this case the reection coecients are
precisely the (generalized) quantum dimensions of the original theory. indeed, these boundary
conditions do not only preserve the orbifold subalgebra a, but even the full chiral algebra
a. it is well known [7] that such boundary conditions are governed by the fusion rules of the
a-theory. in our description this behavior is recovered as follows. the subalgebra c+(a) of
c(a) that is spanned by the basis elements  for the non-symmetric elds and by the sums
(,1) + (,1) for the symmetric elds is an ideal of c(a), and it is in fact isomorphic to the
fusion rule algebra of the wzw theory. its irreducible representations are labelled by orbits
(with multiplicities) of elds in the untwisted sector, which in turn correspond to primary elds
in the original wzw theory. since according to the results of [1, 2] the boundary conditions
that preserve the full bulk symmetry are precisely those that come from the untwisted sector
of the orbifold, this is not surprising at all.

the second automorphism type of boundary conditions is provided by those which corre-
spond to orbits in the twisted sector; they are thus labelled with dotted indices, m = . they
do not preserve the full bulk symmetry, but only a. we get as many symmetry breaking
boundary conditions as there are symmetric primary elds in the original theory. the corre-
sponding boundary states only involve the boundary blocks (,) of symmetric elds; moreover,
due to the factor of  in (4.10) only the combinations (,1)  (,1) appear. the latter are
just twisted boundary blocks and reect the breaking of the bulk symmetries. these boundary
conditions are described by the irreducible representations of a complementary ideal c(a) of
the classifying algebra, namely the one which is spanned by the dierences (,1)  (,1) of
basis elements of c(a).
let us nally remark that for the determination of boundary conditions, we only need to
know the s-matrix elements that involve at least one primary eld from the untwisted sec-
tor. as a consequence, while the determination of the wzw orbifolds becomes technically
more involved for groups g other than z2, the generalization of our results to boundary condi-
tions that preserve any orbifold algebra under an arbitrary abelian group of automorphisms is
straightforward.

a appendix

here we collect the pertinent properties of the twisted theta functions (3.46) and their weyl
sums (3.45) that are needed in the main text. these results are actually of a more general
validity than is needed for our present purposes. namely, they hold for any pair of lattices l
and l of rank r that satisfy the following conditions. first, l must be a sublattice of l, while
l in turn is a sublattice of l/2, i.e.

this also implies that l l l/2. second, both l and 2 l are even lattices; when already
l is an even lattice, we put l l := 1, while otherwise we set l l := 2. finally, we choose some
subgroup w of the group isometries of these lattices. in the case of interest to us, l = l
 and

(a.1)

l  l  1

2 l ;

32

l = l
 are associated to the coroot lattice of a nite-dimensional simple lie algebra g in the
manner described in subsection 3.3, so they have r = r, and w = w is the weyl group of g.
in the case of inner automorphisms the required properties of the lattices are realized triv-
ially, since we simply have l
 = l, so that in particular l l = 1. for the case of outer
automorphisms, on the other hand, we have l l = 2, except for g = a2n. the latter case is in fact
/2 = q(bn)
not covered by the setting described above, since the relevant lattice 2 l
is then not even (see table (3.29) and formula (3.36)). nevertheless this exceptional a2n-case
with outer automorphism can still be treated by essentially the same methods. only a specic
modication of the requirements to be imposed on shift vectors is necessary, see formula (a.11)
below.

a.1 twisted theta functions

the twisted theta functions of our interest are the lattice sums

,h[s1, s2](, z) :=xl
 ,h[s1, s2](, z) :=x l

e2i (+hs1+h,+hs1+h)/2he2i(z+s2,+hs1+h) ,

e2i ( +hs1+h , +hs1+h )/2he2i(z+s2, +hs1+h ) ,

(a.2)

where  is in the upper complex half plane, z, s1, s2  lz
properties of these functions are the following.

r, h z>0, and  l,  l. some
,h[s1, s2] depends on  only modulo hl. also, it depends on  and s1 only via the combi-

nation  + hs1; but still it proves to be convenient to keep both parameters.

for any automorphism (i.e., lattice preserving isometry) w of the lattice l one has

,h[w(s1), w(s2)](, z) = w1(),h[s1, s2](, w1(z)) ;

(a.3)

in particular, the two functions coincide as functions of  . (when l is the coroot lattice or
root lattice of a nite-dimensional simple lie algebra g, every automorphism is an element of
the product of the weyl group w of g with certain outer automorphisms.)

manifestly, s1 is dened only modulo l and l, respectively.
concerning shifts in s2, we have

,h[s1, s2+](, z) = e2i(h(,s1)+(,)) ,h[s1, s2](, z)

for every   l. for  =   l l this reduces to

,h[s1, s2+](, z) = e2ih(,s1) ,h[s1, s2](, z) .

(a.4)

(a.5)

next we study the t-transformation t :  7  + 1, z 7 z. using the fact that (, ) 2z and
(, ) z for all   l and all  l l, we see that the twisted theta functions get multiplied
by a phase,
(a.6)

,h[s1, s2]( +1, z) = e2i( (,)

2 (s1,s1)) ,h[s1, s1+s2](, z) ,

2h  h

33

provided that

(s1, )  z for all   l .

(a.7)

this nicely reects the fact that the t-transformation is the element of the mapping class group
of the torus that adds an a-cycle to the b-cycle of the torus.

all these properties apply analogously to the twisted theta functions  ,h[s1, s2] that are
dened with the lattice l in place of l. however, in the case of the t-transformation we now
have to take the l lth power in order for the twisted theta function to acquire just a phase.
more precisely, under the condition that

as well as

for all

  l and all  l, it follows that

2 ( , )  z

( , ) + 2 (s1, )  z

 ,h[s1, s2]( +l l, z) = e2il l( ( , )

2h  h

2 (s1,s1))  ,h[s1, l ls1+s2](, z) .

(a.8)

(a.9)

(a.10)

the relation (a.8) is indeed satised, since 2   l (l), while (a.9) reduces to 2(s1, ) z
because the lattice 2 l is even, which in turn is valid whenever (a.7) holds, again as a conse-
quence of 2   l.
in the previous reasoning we have used explicitly the requirement that 2l is an even lattice.
as already noted above, this is not fullled in the case where g = a2n and  = c. now the rele-
vant lattice l is in this special case spanned by the elements (i) = (i)+(2n+1i), i = 1, 2, ... , n,
of the a2n root lattice.
inspection shows that the condition (a.8) is then still satised, for
the same reason as before, but condition (a.9) no longer reduces to (a.7). rather, one must
distinguish between the cases where ( , ) is integral and those where it lies in z+1/2. in the
former case the coecient of (n) in an expansion of  with respect to the (i) is even, while in
the latter case it is odd. it follows that the requirement on s1 is that

s1 = s + 1

2

n

xi=1

mi ((i) + (2n+1i))

with mi  z for i = 1, 2, ... , n and

s = 1

4 ((n) + (n+1)) ,

(a.11)

(a.12)

which is the a2n-weight already encountered in (3.61).

to study also the s-transformation s:  71/ , z 7 z/ , we consider both types of functions
together. poisson resummation shows that twisted theta functions of one type transform into

34

linear combinations of twisted theta functions of the other type, according to

,h[s1, s2]( 1

 , z

 ) = |l/l|1/2 hr/2(i )r/2 eih(z,z)/

e2ih(s1,s2) xl/h l

e2i( ,)/h  ,h[s2,s1](, z)

 ,h[s1, s2]( 1

 , z

 ) = | l/ l|1/2 hr/2(i )r/2 eih(z,z)/

e2ih(s1,s2) x l/hl

e2i(, )/h ,h[s2,s1](, z) .

(a.13)

the behavior of the shift parameters is again in accordance with the action of the mapping
class group element on the fundamental cycles. notice that the factor exp(2i( , )/h) is
single-valued when  is dened modulo h l, because  l, and also when  is dened modulo
hl, because  l; then the isomorphisms l/l= (l/ l) = l/ l (compare (3.32)) imply that
there are as many -functions as -functions.
the matrices 8

,  = |l/l|1/2hr/2 e2ih(s1,s2) e2i( ,)/h ,
s (0)
= | l/ l|1/2hr/2 e2ih(s1,s2) e2i(, )/h

,

that arise in the s-transformation (a.13) are not unitary; rather,

s (0)
, (s (0)

, ) = |l/ l|1  ,  ,

s (1)
,(s (1)

,) = | l/l|  ,  .

(a.14)

(a.15)

because of |l/ l| =| l/l| (compare formula (3.33)), both for s (0) and s (1) the two relations
come with the same factor as they should.

a.2 twisted -functions
using the w-character  we now antisymmetrize the - and -functions according to

w,h[s1, s2](, z) := xww
w,h
[s1, s2](, z) := xww

(w) w(),h[s1, s2](, z) ,

(w) w( ),h[s1, s2](, z) .

(a.16)

these functions inherit most of their properties from those of the twisted theta functions. let
us list some of them.

8 just like for the ordinary characters, the further factor eih(z,z)/ gets absorbed by the inhomogeneous
transformation u 7 u (z, z)/2 of a third variable u on which these functions should depend. for brevity that
variable is suppressed throughout this paper.

35

they are invariant under shifts by the lattice hl and h l, respectively:

w+h[s1, s2] = w [s1, s2]
w+h 

[s1, s2] = w

[s1, s2]

for all   l ,
  l .
for all

(a.17)

they depend only on the combination  + hs1 and  + hs1, respectively. thus as a parameter
of w, s1 can be regarded as being dened modulo l, and as a parameter of w, modulo l;
still, in both cases we will keep both arguments.

because of (a.4) we have

w,h[s1, s2+](, z) = e2ih(,s1) xww
w,h
[s1, s2+ ](, z) = e2ih( ,s1) xww

(w) e2i(,w()) w(),h[s1, s2](, z) ,

(w) e2i( ,w( )) w( ),h[s1, s2](, z)

(a.18)

for all   l and  l.
at z = 0 those w-functions for which s2 lies in l have integral coecients in the expansion
in powers of q = exp(2i ).
as the lattices l an l are mapped to themselves under w, the w- and w-functions are
w-odd (that is, -twisted):

ww()[s1, s2] = (w) w [s1, s2]
ww( )

[s1, s2] = (w) w

[s1, s2]

for all w w ,
for all w w .

(a.19)

owing to (a.6), (a.10) and (a.18), respectively, under the above-mentioned restrictions on

the shift vector s1 we have

w,h[s1, s2]( +1, z) = e2i( (,)
2h  h
 ,h[s1, s2]( +l l, z) = e2il l( ( , )

2h  h

2 (s1,s1)) w,h[s1, s1+s2](, z) ,
2 (s1,s1)) w,h[s1, l ls1+s2](, z)

(a.20)

for the behavior under the t-operation.

a.3 the s-transformation
the transformation of w and w under the s-operation could still be discussed for the general
situation studied so far, provided that appropriate properties of the group w are imposed. for
brevity we now restrict, however, our attention to the specic case that is of interest in the
main text. thus in particular w = w is the weyl group of g, while  =  is the sign function
of the coxeter group w. combining the result (a.13) with the fact that the group w acts
on all four lattices by isometries and with the representation property of , it follows that in
this case we have

,h[s1, s2]( 1


 , z

 ) = |l/l
h xww
x p ++

|1/2hr/2(i )r/2 eih(z,z)/ e2ih(s1,s2)

,h

,h[s2,s1](, z) ,

 ) = | l/ l
h xww
xp ++
g ={} and p ++

g ={ }, so that according to (a.21) and

(a.22)

respectively. moreover, we have p ++
(a.22) we nd

,g[s1, s2]( 1

|1/2(g)r /2(i )r /2eig(z,z)/

e2ig(s1,s2)

(a.23)

(w) e2i( ,w())/g

.

(a.24)

where

 := xww
|| = |l/g l

the absolute value of the number  follows from the general orthogonality relations (a.15):

|1/2  | l/gl

|1/2 .

(a.25)

to determine its phase, we employ the denominator identity of the nite-dimensional orbit lie
algebra to nd

 = y

(2i sin(

( , )

g ))

(a.26)

with  the set of symmetric g-roots, which implies that  i|| is a positive real number.
collecting these results, we can conclude that

,g[s2,s1](, z) ,

e2ig(s1,s2) 

,g[s2,s1](, z) ,

where d is the dimension of the nite-dimensional orbit lie algebra.

finally we consider the relation (a.18) for the special case where the vectors   l and
 l lie in addition in the coweight lattice of g. in this case we have (, w()) = (, ) mod z
and ( , w()) = ( , ) mod z for all w  w , and hence

w,h[s1, s2+](, z) = e2i(h(,s1)+(,)) w,h[s1, s2](, z) ,
w,h[s1, s2+ ](, z) = e2i(h( ,s1)+( , )) w,h[s1, s2](, z) .
