abstract

gauged wznw models are integrable conformal eld theories. we
integrate the classical sl(2,r)/u(1) theory with periodic boundary
conditions, which describes closed strings moving in a curved target-
space geometry. we calculate its poisson bracket structure by solv-
ing an initial state problem. the results dier from previous eld-
theoretic calculations due to zero modes. for a future exact canoni-
cal quantization the physical elds are (non-locally) transformed onto
canonical free elds.

key words: conformal eld theory, integrability, black hole

1 introduction

the sl(2,r)/u(1) gauged wznw model has attracted much interest in the
past [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] before it was recognized that this non-linear theory
is classically integrable [9]. more generally, we could prove that integrability
holds for any gauged wznw theory [10]. this was known for nilpotent
gauging only, which yields toda theories [11, 7]. so far we have completely
integrated the non-linear equations of motion of the classical sl(2,r)/u(1)
model for a eld theoretic case with asymptotic boundary conditions [10].

in this paper we solve the classical sl(2,r)/u(1) theory for periodic
boundary conditions. as a conformal eld theory this model describes a

1

closed string moving in the background of a black hole target-space metric
[3]. it is especially interesting for quantization; quantum mechanical defor-
mations of its metric and a correlated dilaton [12] were obtained in some
perturbative manner [4, 5, 6]. however, these calculations were based on an
incomplete eective action [13, 14, 10].

our intention is to provide a dierent understanding of such quantum
mechanical results. starting with an entirely classical approach [1, 10], we
expect that the exact classical solution of this theory will facilitate its exact
canonical quantization. we calculate, as in the eld theoretic case, the pois-
son bracket structure of the theory by solving an initial state problem and
look for a canonical transformation of the physical elds onto canonical free
elds. but the results for periodic boundary conditions cannot simply be
inferred from the eld theoretic ones because additional zero modes become
important.

to make this paper self-contained, we mention in section 2 some of our
earlier results; more details are found in ref. [10]. first we dene the the-
ory, give its general solution and inspect the symmetry properties. section
3 solves an initial state problem which allows us to calculate in section 4
the poisson bracket structure of the model. a free-eld realization of these
brackets is given in section 5. the summary provides a canonical transfor-
mation of the physical elds onto the free elds. some technical details are
found in two appendices.

2 the sl(2,r)/u(1) theory

the exact action of the sl(2,r)/u(1) gauged wznw theory written in light-
cone coordinates z =  + , z =   

s[r, t] =

1

2 zm (cid:0)zrzr + tanh2r ztzt(cid:1) dz dz

(1)

was derived entirely classically and in a gauge invariant manner [1, 10]. m
has cylindrical topology where the space-like submanifolds are topologically
equivalent to a circle

m = r  s1,

i.e.

0    2,  <  < .

(2)

the physical elds r(,  ), t(,  ), which represent the position of a closed
bosonic string in the target-space at proper time  , are subject to the bound-

2

ary conditions

r( + 2,  ) = r(,  ),

t( + 2,  ) = t(,  ) + 2w, w  z.

(3)

the t coordinate is an angular variable given modulo 2 only, and the winding
number w tells us how often the string surrounds the coordinate origin. the
string moves in the curved metric of a euclidean black hole [3]

ds2 = dr2 + tanh2r dt2,

(4)

and the dynamics is given by the equations of motion

zzr =

sinhr
cosh3r

ztzt,

1

zzt = 

sinhr coshr

(zrzt + ztzr) .

(5)

these equations are integrable because they have a lax pair representation

(cid:2)z  c, z  c(cid:3) = z c  zc (cid:2)c, c(cid:3) = 0.

c and c take values in the lie algebra of the group sl(2,r) [10]

c = cat a,

c = cat a,

(a = 1, 2, 3)

one can check that

makes the atness condition (6) equivalent to the equations of motion (5).
but unlike toda theories [15] there is at present no general method to inte-
grate a lax pair following from a non-nilpotent gauged wznw model like (6)
directly. we found the general solution of (5) in [9] by analysing non-abelian
toda theories [7, 8] as

sinh2r = x x,

t = i(b  b) +

i
2

ln

x
x

(10)

with the denitions

x = a +

b
a

(1 + a a),

x = a +

b
a (1 + a a).

(11)

a = a(z), b = b(z), a = a(z) and b = b(z) are complex (anti-) chiral
parameter functions and a(z) etc. derivatives. however, as we shall see we
must restrict this solution in order to render r and t real. straightforward
substitution shows that the solution (10) fullls the equations of motion (5).
but it will become obvious from the investigation of initial-value problems of
section 3 that the solution (10) exhausts the entire solution space (excluding
singular solutions).

the theory is also characterized by conservation laws. the equations of
motion (5) guarantee, in particular, conservation and chirality of the energy-
momentum tensor (we shall omit the anti-chiral parts whenever possible)

t  tzz =

1

2 (cid:0)(zr)2 + tanh2r (zt)2(cid:1) ,

tz z = 0,

(12)

and in addition of parafermionic observables [16, 1, 9]

v =

1
2 ei (zr  i tanhr zt) ,

where  is dened by

z = (cid:0)1 + tanh2r (cid:1) zt,

z = (cid:0)1  tanh2r (cid:1) zt.

(13)

(14)

since the integrability condition of these equations corresponds to one of the
equations of motion (5), the general solution (10) integrates eqs. (14) to

 = t + i(b + b) + i ln(1 + a a) 

i
2

ln(1 + x x) + 0.

(15)

the main purpose of this paper is to calculate the poisson bracket struc-
ture of the model, assuming canonical poisson brackets for the physical elds
r,t and their conjugate momenta. therefore, we have to nd a, b, a and b
as functions of these physical variables. in principle, they are given by solv-
ing an initial state problem dened by a second order dierential equation
of the gelfand-dikii type

y  (zv/v)y  2t y = 0,

(16)

4

because its two independent solutions y1, y2 are related to our parameter
functions

y1 = eb,

y2 = aeb,

(17)

and the coecients of (16) are functions of r, t and their derivatives. this
dierential equation simply follows from the conserved quantities (12, 13)
and (17) as an identity.

but the functions a, b, a and b are not uniquely determined by this
procedure. because the solution (10) is invariant under the gl(2,c) trans-
formations

aa  b
ca + d

,

a  t [a] =
b  t [b] = b + ln(ca + d),
a  t [ a] =
b  t [ b] = b + ln(b a + a),
d (cid:19)  gl(2,c),

(cid:18) a b

d a  c
b a + a

c

,

(18)

they are only given by the physical elds up to four complex constants. we
shall x this arbitrariness in the next section.

the monodromy properties of the functions a, b, a, b are, as well,

determined by gl(2,c) transformations

a(z + 2) = t [a(z)] =

pa(z)  q
ra(z) + s

,

b(z + 2) = t [b(z)] = b(z) + ln(ra(z) + s),
a(z  2) = t [ a(z)] =
b(z  2) = t [ b(z)] = b(z) + ln(q a(z) + p),

s a(z)  r
q a(z) + p

,

(cid:18) p q

s (cid:19)  gl(2,c).

r

(19)

we should remark here that the gl(2,c) transformations act, indeed, in two
dierent manners. we also nd that  is not periodic modulo 2

( + 2,  ) = (,  ) + 2w + i ln(ps + qr).

(20)

5

therefore, the conserved quantities v and v are not periodically dened.
we can describe their periodicity behaviour by the conserved total momen-
tum of the eld t

pt =

1
2

2

z

0

tanh2r t d =

2

z

0

t(,  ) d.

(21)

using the eqs. (14), instead of (20) we obtain for  and  the periodicity
relations in terms of pt

( + 2,  )  (,  ) =

( + 2,  )  (,  ) =

so it holds that

+2


+2

z

z



(,  ) d = 2w + 2pt,

(,  ) d = 2w  2pt.

(22)

v(z + 2) = ei 2ptv(z),

v(z  2) = ei 2pt v(z),

(23)

and we can dene, up to a constant normalization, new periodic conserved
quantities

w  ei 2ptz/(2)v,

w  ei 2pt z/(2) v.

comparing (20) and (22) the real-valued momentum pt becomes

2pt = i ln(ps + qr),

(24)

(25)

so that the monodromy transformations (19) are restricted to those with unit
determinant

|ps + qr| = 1.

(26)

3 the solution of initial value problems

it is advantageous to use in the following calculations kruskal coordinates

u = sinhr eit,

u = sinhr eit.

(27)

6

the general solution (10) can then be parameterized most symmetrically by
the solution of the gelfand-dikii equations yk(z), yk(z)

u =

y1y
y1y

1 + y2y
2
2  y
1y2

,

u =

y1 y
y1 y

1 + y2 y

.

we shall restrict ourselves, furthermore, to regular solutions

y1y

2  y

1y2 6= 0,

y1y

2  y

1y2 6= 0 z, z,

(28)

(29)

which guarantee that the gelfand-dikii equations are not singular, because
their coecients, determined by

are non-singular. the gl(2,c) invariance of the general solution (28) now
takes the form

(cid:18) y2
y1 (cid:19)  (cid:18) a b

(31)

it determines the solutions yk(z), yk(z) in terms of the physical elds u, u,
just as before, up to four indeterminate integration constants, provided we
have chosen for the physical elds the initial values at time 0

u(, 0) = u0(), u(, 0) = u0(),

u(, 0) = u1(),

u(, 0) = u1().

(32)

but in contrast to that, the chiral and anti-chiral second order gelfand-dikii
dierential equations allow together eight integration constants for their four
independent solutions. this puzzle can be solved as follows: dierentiating
the general solution (28), four rst order dierential equations result

y

(33)

the elimination of the anti-chiral functions yk(z) yield, again, the gelfand-
dikii equations

y
k  (zv/v)y
7

k  2t yk = 0,

(34)

and correspondingly the anti-chiral equations result. in case, we look now for
solutions of these equations which fullll besides the initial state conditions
(32) the linear dierential equations (33) too, the number of integration
constants is reduced from eight to the four of the gl(2,c) invariance group.
fixing this gl(2,c) invariance the parameter functions yk, yk are determined,
in principle, from the physical elds u, u uniquely.

since the coecients of the gelfand-dikii equations (34) are periodic
functions of z, apart from yk(z) also the functions yk(z + 2) are solutions of
these equations. they are given by (19) as linear combinations of the yk(z)

(cid:18) y2(z + 2)
y1(z + 2) (cid:19) = m (cid:18) y2(z)

y1(z) (cid:19) ,

m = (cid:18) p q

under the gl(2,c) transformation n, the monodromy transformation m
changes according to

m = (cid:18) e

(the non-diagonalizable cases can be obtained by a limiting procedure).

the periodicity conditions (35) then simplify to

y1(z + 2) = e
y1(z  2) = e 

y1(z),
y1(z),

y2(z + 2) = e 
y2(z  2) = e

y2(z),
y2(z).

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

these properties already restrict the possible gl(2,c) transformations (31)
to scalings with only two free parameters a and d

y1 (cid:19)  (cid:18) ay2
(cid:18) y2

dy1 (cid:19) , (cid:18) y2

y1 (cid:19)  (cid:18) dy2

ay1 (cid:19) .

(40)

this means, we have implicitly xed two of the four integration constants.
any function invariant under the scalings (40) can now be determined u-
niquely by (39), in particular, the periodic quotients

k(z)

(45)

are the zero modes of the elds k(z). (in passing we mention that (39),
(42) imply e = e1, and we dene   1.) but we have to stress here
especially that this result does not deliver k or yk explicitly as functions of u,
u. however, it will be sucient in order to calculate their poisson brackets.

4 the poisson brackets

we calculate poisson brackets by assuming canonical poisson brackets of the
physical elds, which are obtained from the action (1). for the kruskal
coordinates we get the following non-vanishing expressions

{u(,  ), u(,  )} = {u(,  ), u(,  )} = 22(1 + uu)2(  ),
{ u(), u()} = 22( uu  u u)2(  ),
where 2 is the periodic -function dened by

2(  ) 



xn=

9

(   + 2n).

(46)

(47)

this allows us to calculate poisson brackets of all quantities explicitly
expressed in terms of the physical elds. here we want to determine the
poisson brackets of the parameter functions yk(z). we saw in the preceding
section, that the k are uniquely dened by the initial state conditions, but
they were not given explicitly as functions of the physical elds. we shall
show that the poisson brackets of the k, and the yk can, nevertheless, be
derived.

first, we have to determine the poisson brackets of the k(z), and those
of the yk then follow by means of (42). we calculate the variations k(z) as
functions of the varied physical elds and momenta by varying the gelfand-
dikii equations

y

k  (zv/v)y

k  2t yk = (zv/v)y

k + 2t yk.

(48)

we vary, as well, the boundary conditions (39), eliminate  and  , and
get subsidiary conditions for the equations (48)

k(z)yk(z + 2)  yk(z)y
y

k(z + 2) = y

k(z + 2)yk(z)  yk(z + 2)y

k(z).
(49)

they restrict the general solution of (48), which is dened by a special solu-
tion of (48) and the general solution of (34), to

yk(z) =

the variations c k correspond to the undetermined scalings (40). they
cannot simply be set to zero because we are integrating (50) over non-periodic
functions of z, and without the term ckyk(z) these integrals would depend
on a shift of the integration range.

[10] we observe here a
in distinction to the eld theoretic results of ref.
structurally changed non-local realization of the algebra. this is due to zero
modes which arise additionally in the periodic case. it might be surprising
that the algebra treats y1 and y2 (as well as y1 and y2) asymmetrically. a
symmetric treatment of the functions yk and yk is presented in appendix b.
but it turns out that the algebra (54) is more appropriate for transforming
the yk, yk onto canonical free elds.

5 the canonical transformation onto periodic

free elds

there are several methods to nd relations between yk(z), yk(z) and chiral,
respectively anti-chiral components k(z), k(z) of canonical free elds (k =
1, 2)

k(,  ) = k(z) + k(z).

(55)

sometimes it will be useful to have the mode expansions in mind, e. g.,

k(z) =

(56)

w is an integer winding number.

here we simply assume that there is a free-eld theory with a corre-
sponding free-eld energy-momentum tensor which is canonically related to
our sl(2,r) model. then the easiest and most straightforward approach
identies the energy-momentum tensors of both theories

.

(57)

furthermore, we assume that the free elds 1, 2 are local expressions of
the parameter functions yk.

it is appropriate to introduce complex free elds
 = 1  i2,

 = 1 + i2,

(58)

12

which factorize the components of the energy-momentum tensor

t (z) = zz ,

t (z) = zz .

(55) gives a corresponding chiral decomposition of  and 

(,  ) = (z) + (z),

(,  ) = (z) + (z),

with

(z) = 1(z) + i2(z),
(z) = 1(z)  i2(z),

(z) = 1(z)  i 2(z),
(z) = 1(z) + i 2(z).

(59)

(60)

(61)

the most general solution of this problem depends on several complex

constants, and it is given by [14]

but the constants can be further restricted. taking into consideration the
invariance of (59) under   ei,   ei, we can choose c real positive.
of course, the physics should not depend on the choice of the branch of the
logarithm. this implies c = 1. furthermore, 2 is dened modulo 2/
only (i.e. 2 takes values on a circle with radius 1/)

but this is consistent with (62) and (39) only if one of the pairs (, ) and
(, ) is (0, 0). choosing  =  = 0, the rescaling (40) now allows us to set

without loss of generality x d = d = 0. thus the solution (62) simplies

we have checked that the free-eld poisson brackets (67) yield, conversely,
the non-local poisson brackets of the yk(z), yk(z) (54), and we could show

14

that these results also follow from the gelfand-dikii equations (34), in case,
their coecients are expressed in terms of the free elds and the initial state
problem is solved anew.

this proves that these free-eld transformations of the physical elds r,

t, or u, u are canonical transformations, and they are one to one.

6 summary

we have completely integrated the periodic sl(2,r)/u(1) gauged wznw
theory and calculated its symplectic structure. this allows us to relate this
model canonically to a free-eld theory. the results could be summarized
in terms of local backlund transformations which are identical to those of
the non-periodic case [10].
instead, we give here the complete canonical
transformation of the elds u(,  ), u(,  ) onto the free elds

u = e(+ )(cid:0)1 +  (cid:1) 
u = e( +)(cid:0)1 +  (cid:1) 

e(+ ) 
this transformation is non-locally dened by

as in liouville theory this structure might require quantum mechanical defor-
mations. but we might be confronted, as well, with further unusual problems
related to the quantization of the parafermionic structure of the theory, which
is classically dened by non-linear poisson brackets. using the freedom of
normalization of (24) (here we take into consideration the full q zero mode
of the free eld) for the periodic case the parafermions full
{w(z), w(z)} = 2w(z)w(z) h(z  z),
{w(z), w(z)} = 2w(z)w(z) h(z  z) +

in our opinion this may be a good starting point for a quantization. there-
fore, it remains a challange to implement the exact canonical quantization of
the sl(2,r)/u(1) model on the basis of our results.

we would very much like to thank c. ford and g. jorjadze for reading the
manuscript and for useful discussions.

a the denition of the integration constants

here we explain the relations (42) in more detail.

using chirality, the functions k(z) of (41) can be integrated to

ln yk(z) =

1
2

z

0

k(z)h(z  z)dz +

z

k + dk.

(73)

h(z) and k are dened by (43), (45). dk are the integration constants under
discussion. let us consider the canonical free eld (58), (66)

1(z)y2(z)

2(z)  y

(74)

equations (41) and (33) allow one to replace the functions y
k(z), yk(z) and
y1(z) by k(z). then,  is completely given in terms of k(z) and the physical
elds u, u

(75)

(76)

similarly, eqs. (33) yield

which shows that we could express , as well, in terms of k(z) and u, u.

on the other hand, substituting (73) into (74) we obtain

is an integer due to the periodicity of y1(z)/y2(z) (cp. (39) with the (anti-)
chiral (73)). d1  d2 is uniquely determined by the constant zero modes of
 and 
(80)

d1  d2 = q  q.

since the two parts of (74) are the chiral and anti-chiral components of ,
and distributing the zero mode q half and half to these components, by
comparison we obtain

d1 =

d1 =

d2 =

the constants q and q in terms of the k
