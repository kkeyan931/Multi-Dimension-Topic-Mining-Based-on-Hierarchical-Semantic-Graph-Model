abstract

we consider duality between type 0b string theory on ads5  s 5 and the planar
cft on n electric d3-branes coincident with n magnetic d3-branes. it has been argued
that this theory is stable up to a critical value of the t hooft coupling but is unstable
beyond that point. we suggest that from the gauge theory point of view the development
of instability is associated with singularity in the dimension of the operator corresponding
to the tachyon eld via the ads/cft map. such singularities are common in large n
theories because summation over planar graphs typically has a nite radius of convergence.
hence we expect transitions between stability and instability for string theories in ads
backgrounds that are dual to certain large n gauge theories: if there are tachyons for large
ads radius then they may be stabilized by reducing the radius below a critical value of
order the string scale.

1. introduction

it has been proposed [1,2,3,4] that certain 4-dimensional non-supersymmetric large
n gauge theories are dual to backgrounds of the type 0 string theory [5]. this work was
motivated by the recently discovered relations between type iib strings and superconformal
gauge theories on n coincident d3-branes [6,7,8,9,10] as well as by polyakovs suggestion
[11] (building on his earlier work [12]) that the type 0 string theory is a natural setting
for extending this duality to non-supersymmetric gauge theories. since then a number
of further studies of d-branes in type 0 theories [13,14,15] and the associated dualities
[16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23] have appeared.

it is well known that taking the low energy limit on a stack of n d3-branes in at space
and comparing it to the corresponding limit of the 3-brane classical solution suggests that
the n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) gauge theory is dual to type iib strings on ads5  s 5
[8,9,10]. generalizations of this duality to other 4-dimensional gauge theories follow if
the stack of d3-branes is placed on a transverse space y6 which is a cone over an einstein
manifold x5 [24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. then the the cft on the d3-branes is dual to type iib
string theory on ads5  x5. an interesting set of dualities of this sort is found if y6 is an
orbifold r6/ where  is a discrete subgroup of so(6) [25,26]. the corresponding theories
on the branes are conformal if the orbifold group acts appropriately on the gauge indices
[24]. duality between such cfts and type iib backgrounds of the form ads5  s 5/
is thus an orbifold of the original duality between the n = 4 theory and the ads5  s 5
background. remarkably, a large class of such cfts is non-supersymmetric in the large
n (planar) limit [25,26]. a phenomenological application of non-supersymmetric cfts
was recently proposed in [31].

alternatively, one may construct gauge theory/string dualities by stacking d3-branes
in string models other than type iib. type 0 theories are attractive in this regard but they
have a well-known and seemingly fatal aw in that their spectrum contains a tachyon of
m2 = 2/ which is not removed by the non-chiral gso projection (1)f + f = 1. in
[1] it was suggested, however, that the tachyon may be stabilized in appropriate type 0
backgrounds which are relevant to gauge theory applications.

the type 0 models have a doubled set of rr elds compared to their type ii cousins,
hence they also possess twice as many d-branes [1]. for example, since type 0b spectrum
has an unrestricted 4-form gauge potential, there are two types of d3-branes: those that
couple electrically to this gauge potential, and those that couple magnetically. very impor-
tantly, the weakly coupled spectrum of open strings on type 0 d-branes does not contain
tachyons after the gso projection (1)fopen = 1 is implemented [1,11,32]. thus, gauge
theories living on such d-branes do not have obvious instabilities. this suggests via the

1

gauge eld/string duality that the bulk tachyon instability of type 0 theory may be cured
as well [1,4].

let us review an argument for the tachyon stabilization in the simplest setting, which
is the stack of n electric and n magnetic d3-branes [4]. for such a stack the net tachyon
tadpole cancels so that there exists a classical solution with t = 0.
in fact, since the
stack couples to the selfdual part of the 5-form eld strength, the type 0b 3-brane classical
solution is identical to the type iib one. taking the throat limit suggests that the low-
energy eld theory on n electric and n magnetic d3-branes is dual to the ads5  s 5
background of type 0b theory and is therefore conformal in the planar limit [4]. this
theory is the u (n )  u (n ) gauge theory coupled to 6 adjoint scalars of the rst u (n ), 6
adjoint scalars of the second u (n ), and fermions in the bifundamental representations  4
weyl fermions in the (n, n) and 4 weyl fermions in the (n, n) (the u (1) factors decouple
in the infrared). while such a theory does not correspond to placing type iib d3-branes at
an orbifold point, it is nevertheless a z2 projection of the n = 4 u (2n ) gauge theory [4].
the z2 is generated by (1)fs, where fs is the fermion number, together with conjugation
by (cid:18) i
0 i (cid:19) where i is the n  n identity matrix. this is related to the fact that type
0 string theories may be viewed as (1)fs orbifolds of the corresponding type ii theories
[5]. in [18] it was pointed out that, since (1)fs is an element of the center of the su (4)
r-symmetry, this z2 projection of the n = 4 theory belongs to the class studied in [25,26].
the fact that the non-supersymmetric ads/cft duality considered in [4] is a z2
quotient of the n = 4 duality [4,18] lends additional credence to its validity. in particular,
general arguments presented in [33] guarantee that the eld theory is conformal in the
planar limit and that planar correlators of untwisted vertex operators coincide with those
of the n = 4 theory. since this cft does not appear to have any instabilities at weak
coupling, it was argued in [4] that type 0b string theory on ads5  s 5 is stable for
suciently small radius. this provides a simple ads/cft argument in favor of tachyon
stabilization; it is also an example of how gauge theory may be used to make predictions
about the string theory dual to it.

we should note that some important aspects of this particular z2 quotient are related
to the twisted sector of the orbifold and are not covered by the analysis in [33]. to analyze
some of the physics it will be important that this theory is dual to type 0b rather than
type iib background. therefore, in the usual gravity limit where the radius of ads5  s 5
becomes large in string units and space becomes locally at, this background is unstable [4].
from the cft point of view it means that the limit of innite t hooft coupling, which
is commonly discussed in the ads/cft context, does not make sense. the ads/cft
correspondence applied to this particular case implies that, as  = g2
y m n is increased, a

2

transition should happen at a critical value c [4]. in this paper we address the origin of this
transition from the eld theory point of view and argue that it is due to a singularity of a
sum over planar diagrams. in non-supersymmetric large n eld theories such singularities
are expected to occur on general grounds [34].1 we identify the eld theory quantity which
we expect to become singular at c: it is the dimension of the operator which corresponds
to the tachyon eld via the ads/cft map. using the methods of [6] we show that this
operator is

(1.1)

where f and x i are the eld strength and the 6 adjoint scalars of su (n )1 while g and
y i are the corresponding objects of su (n )2. adding such an operator to the action creates
a dierence between the gauge couplings of su (n )1 and su (n )2. in non-supersymmetric
eld theory this is not expected to be an exactly marginal deformation. by analyzing 2-
loop beta functions we show that the operator (1.1) indeed picks an anomalous dimension
of order 2. higher loops graphs will correct the dimension  as well, and it is conceiv-
able that () develops a singularity at some critical value c as suggested by the ads
considerations.

2. anomalous dimension of the tachyon operator

the standard relation between scalar operator dimension in a conformal eld theory

and mass in ads5 is [9,10,30]

 = 2 p4 + m2l2 .

(2.1)

this relation is denitely valid in the gravity limit where l2/ = 2  1. applying
this relation to the case of type 0 tachyon, m2 = 2/, we immediately nd that for large
  is complex, hence the cft is unstable. from the ads point of view, the stability
bound [36] that mass-squared must exceed 4/l2 is violated for suciently large l. for
 of order 1 (i.e. for ads radius of order the string scale) there may be various corrections
to the relation (2.1). even if the overall form of this relation remains the same, l2/
should be treated as some unknown function of , and eective m2 might have the form

m2 = 

2
 +

a1
l2 +

a2
l4 + . . .

(2.2)

1 in view of this fact, which is also supported by evidence from exactly solvable large n models
[35], perhaps the biggest surprise is that certain non-supersymmetric planar cfts appear to make

sense at innite t hooft coupling [25].

3

this forces us to proceed qualitatively.

to begin with let us simply continue the gravity relation to all  without any change.

then we nd

() = 2 q4  22 .

(2.3)

the dimension is real for suciently small , and the unitarity bound  > 1 forces us to
pick the positive branch of the square root. this simplied model for () implies that
(0) = 4 which, as we will see, is the correct answer. however, obviously (2.3) cannot be
exact: it gives an expansion in powers of  while in the gauge theory it has to proceed
in integer powers of  (we will see that the leading anomalous dimension is o(2)). we
expect various corrections to this model such as those discussed above. for example,
tachyon interactions with the r-r 5-form eld strength, which have the form f 2
5 t 2 [1],
give rise to a positive a1 in (2.2). one eect of this shift is to push c to a higher value,
but we cannot rule out the presence of other similar corrections. our qualitative picture
is quite insensitive to details however: () is real for  < c but has a branch cut for
 > c which signals an instability. in the following we will use perturbative eld theory
arguments to support this scenario.

the primary question is: what is the operator in the cft on n electric and n
magnetic d3-branes that couples to the tachyon. the tachyon coupling to a stack of n
electric d3-branes is [1,3,13]

where km(t ) = 1  1

(2.6)

leading to the expression (1.1) for the gauge invariant operator corresponding to the
tachyon eld via the ads/cft map. this operator is odd under the interchange of the
two su (n )s which is related to the fact that the tachyon is one of the twisted states from
the point of view of orbifolding type iib string theory by (1)fs. indeed, the tachyon
belongs to the (n s, n s) sector of type 0b theory which is not present in the type

4

iib spectrum. in other z2 orbifold theories it was also found that twisted states couple
to vertex operators odd under the interchange of the factors of the gauge group [37,28].
fields from the untwisted sector, on the other hand, couple to operators that are even
under the interchange of the gauge groups: for example, the dilaton couples to

(2.7)

in order to study the anomalous dimension of the operator (1.1) at weak coupling,
we may consider slightly unequal gauge couplings for su (n )1 and su (n )2. then the
coupling constant for this operator is

t =

(2.8)

where i = g2

= a(2  1) + o(cid:2)(1  2)2(cid:3) ,

(2.9)

(2.10)

and we nd a = (2)4. due to the vanishing of the one-loop beta function there is no
constant term on the right-hand side of the equations. the two-loop contributions vanish
for equal couplings, as shown explicitly in [4], but they no longer vanish for 1 6= 2.

taking the dierence of the two equations, and working to rst order in t , we have

solving this we have

t = t0(cid:16)

(2.11)

(2.12)

since t grows in the uv (for   ) the associated operator (1.1) is irrelevant to this
order: its dimension is

() = 4 +

2
84 + o(3) .

(2.13)

based on the ads/cft correspondence, we conjecture that further corrections to ()
will produce a function which develops a singularity at c > 0. we do not expect direct
calculations of the anomalous dimension to be feasible beyond o(3) which may be ex-
tracted from 3-loop beta functions. however, it might be possible to put bounds on the
general o(n) terms and prove the existence of a critical point at c > 0.

5

to summarize this paper, we have suggested that nite radius of convergence of planar
graphs, which is a well-known phenomenon in large n eld theories, has interesting im-

plications in view of the ads/cft correspondence. namely, if there is an operator whose
dimension is real up to a critical value of the t hooft coupling but becomes complex be-
yond that value, then the dual ads phenomenon is that a tachyon present in the large

radius (gravity) limit is stabilized for suciently small radii. it is dicult to study such
backgrounds with string-scale curvature directly, but on the dual cft side perturbative

calculations are quite tractable. the perturbative stability of the cft thus provides an
argument for stabilization of tachyons (this is one of the few results to date where eld

theory has been used to make new predictions about string theory), and niteness of the
radius of convergence of planar graphs suggests how instability may develop at suciently
strong coupling. we have discussed one specic example which arises in the context of

type 0 theory but we hope that these phenomena are quite general.
