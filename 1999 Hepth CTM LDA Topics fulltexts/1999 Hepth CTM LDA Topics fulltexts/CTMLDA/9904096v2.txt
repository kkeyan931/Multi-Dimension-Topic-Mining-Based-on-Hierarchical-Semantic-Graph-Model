abstract

we present a direct eld theoretical calculation of the consistent gauge anomaly

in the supereld formalism, on the basis of a denition of the eective action

through the covariant gauge current. the scheme is conceptually and techni-

cally simple and the gauge covariance in intermediate steps reduces calculational

labors considerably. the resultant supereld anomaly, being proportional to the
anomaly dabc = tr t a{t b, t c}, is minimal without supplementing any countert-

erms. our anomaly coincides with the anomaly obtained by marinkovic as the

solution of the wess-zumino consistency condition.

the consistent gauge anomaly [1] might be conceptually more natural than

the covariant gauge anomaly [2], as it is dened as gauge non-invariance of the

eective action of the chiral fermion [3,4]. the consistent anomaly is important

because it provides information on the wess-zumino lagrangian [3]. to nd an ex-

plicit form of the consistent anomaly, one may appeal to the algebraic-geometrical

technique [5-8] or directly perform a eld theoretical calculation with, say, the

pauli-villars regularization. as is well-known, however, both approaches can be

cumbersome for a theory in higher dimensions, or for a theory with a complicated

gauge transformation.

in particular, in the eld theoretical calculation, gauge

non-invariant normal terms (fake anomalies) generally appear. then, to extract

the intrinsic anomaly, one has to nd suitable local counterterms to eliminate these

normal terms.

the covariant gauge anomaly, on the other hand, has the quite restricted pos-

sible form due to the gauge covariance. the necessary calculational labors are

consequently considerably less. therefore, a practically useful calculational scheme

might be formulated by relating the consistent anomaly with the covariant anomaly

(or with a certain gauge covariant expression). in ref. [9], banerjee, banerjee and

mitra gave a eld theoretical prescription which provides this kind of calculational

scheme. this prescription leads to basically equivalent consequences as the result

due to bardeen and zumino [4], and that due to leutwyler [10]. however, the


prescription of ref. [9] is more straightforward and exible.

in this letter, we give a direct eld theoretical calculation of the consistent

gauge anomaly in supersymmetric theories, on the basis of the prescription of ref. [9].

generally, the treatment of the consistent anomaly with the supereld formal-

ism [1224] is quite complicated, because the gauge transformation is highly non-

linear and because the gauge supereld has no mass dimension (i.e., an arbitrary

function of the gauge supereld is a candidate of the counterterm). the advantage

of our treatment in this letter is that the minimal supereld anomaly, being propor-

 it has the application even in chiral gauge theories on the lattice [11].

2

tional to the anomaly dabc = tr t a{t b, t c}, is directly obtained. this minimal-ness

is guaranteed by the basic property of the prescription of ref. [9]. naturally, the

resultant anomaly coincides with that due to marinkovic [24], who applied the tech-

nique of ref. [4] to this problem. also our expressions below have some similarities

with that of the work by mcarthur and osborn [23], in which the formulation

of ref. [10] was generalized to supersymmetric theories. nevertheless, it seems

worthwhile to report on our eld theoretical calculation, because of simplicity of

the basic idea and the treatment.

we consider the massless chiral supereld  coupled to the external gauge
supereld v = v at a (t a is the representation of the gauge group to which 

belongs). the classical action is given by



s =z d8z ev .

(1)

following the prescription of ref. [9], we dene the eective action  [v ] as follows.

we rst introduce an auxiliary gauge coupling parameter



g by v  gv . then we

may dierentiate the eective action with respect to the parameter g and integrate

it over this parameter. noting that the g-dependences arise only through the

combination gv and the original eective action is given by the value at g = 1, we

have the following formal expression of the eective action

 [v ] =

=

 [gv ]
gv a(z)

dg z d8z v a(z)
dg z d8z v a(z)(cid:28) s

v a(z)(cid:29)v gv

(2)

.

here the indication v  gv implies that all v -dependences involved are replaced

by gv . the representation (2) is yet formal, because the regularization of the gauge

 we basically follow the notational conventions of ref. [25]. our particular conventions and

useful identities are summarized in the appendix a.

 as one would anticipate, this parameter g becomes the integration variable appearing in

the homotopy formula [5-8,4].

3

current hs/v a(z)i has to be specied. the crucial point of the prescription

of ref. [9] is to adopt the covariant gauge current as the gauge current. thus

we introduce the proper time cuto to regularize the gauge current in a gauge

covariant manner

(cid:28) s
v a(z)(cid:29) = lim

where the trace tr is taken with the full superspace measure d8z and m denotes

in writing this expression, we have used the formal

expression of the propagator of the chiral supereld in presence of the external
2ev (z  z)/16. (for the derivation

2 1

gauge supereld (cid:10)t(z)(z)(cid:11) = id

of the propagator, see, for example, ref. [26].) note that all the derivatives ,
d  and m transform as  = eiei under the gauge transformation ev 
ei

=
ev ei [25] and thus these are gauge covariant objects. due to the gauge

covariant denition (3), the gauge current transforms covariantly under the gauge

transformation,

v a(z)(cid:29)
(cid:28) s

as is formally expected.

 one can generalize the regulator e + /m 2

in the last line as f ( + /m 2) where f (x) is an
arbitrary rapidly decreasing function with f (0) = 1. the result with f ( + /m 2) is given
by working with e + p/m 2
0 dp g(p); g(p) is the inverse laplace
0 dp g(p)epx. our results in m   are independent
of m and thus of p. therefore, all the results become independent of the choice of the

and then by multiplying r 
transformation of f (x), f (x) = r 
regulator function f (x) in the m   limit because r 

0 dp g(p) = f (0) = 1.

4

the denition of the eective action (2) through the covariant current (3) is

perfectly legitimate. for uv convergent diagrams, it is equivalent to any conven-

tional denition. for uv diverging diagrams, it may give a dierent value from

the conventional denition but only by an amount expressed by local counterterms,

because eq. (3) reduces to the conventional gauge current in the m   limit.

as we will see below, the consistent anomaly derived from the eective action (2)

with eq. (3) is directly related to the covariant anomaly. since the covariant
anomaly [27,23] is proportional to the anomaly dabc, the consistent anomaly thus
obtained is also proportional to dabc. this implies that, when the gauge represen-
tation of the chiral multiplet is anomaly-free, i.e., when dabc = 0, the regularized

eective action (2) with eq. (3) automatically restores the gauge invariance without

supplementing any counterterms. in this sense, a breaking of the gauge symmetry

is kept to be minimal with the present prescription [28].



the same mechanism

works also when one starts with the covariant current and then adds minimal cor-

rections for ensuring the integrability of the whole current [10,23]. our treatment

is, however, more straightforward as it directly denes the eective action. note

that the prescription (2) and (3) is quite dierent from the direct proper time

regularization of the eective action [14,15].

now, from eq. (2), we can read o a variation of the eective action under the

innitesimal gauge transformation [25]

ev = ev i  iev ,

v = ilv /2 h( + ) + coth(lv /2)  (  )i,

(5)

 for anomaly-free cases, the prescription is equivalent [28] to the generalized pauli-villars
regularization introduced in refs. [29,30]. since this is a lagrangian level regularization,
and the corresponding hamiltonian is hermitian, the s-matrix is manifestly unitary. (in the
m   limit, negative norm regulators cannot contribute to the out-state of the physical
s-matrix.)

we then insert dg/dg = 1 into the rst term and perform the integration by parts

with respect to g. by noting again that the g-dependences arise only through the

combination gv , we have the following representation of the consistent anomaly

this anomaly must satisfy the wess-zumino consistency condition because it is

a variation of the eective action (2). eq. (7) shows that the consistent anomaly

consists of two pieces: the rst piece is the covariant gauge anomaly [27,23] that

is obtained from eqs. (3) and (5) as

/4) and the gauge parameter is chiral

third line in plane wave basis, see ref. [27], or the appendix of ref. [26]. the

calculation is quite simple due to the gauge covariance. obviously the covariant
anomaly (8) is proportional to the anomaly dabc, because , w, , and w
lie algebra valued.


 are

the second piece in eq. (7), on the other hand, provides a dierence between

the consistent anomaly and the covariant anomaly [4]. the dierence is expressed

by the functional rotation of the covariant gauge current



v b(z)(cid:28) s

v a(z)(cid:29) 



v a(z)(cid:28) s

v b(z)(cid:29) .

(9)

the importance of this functional rotation has been noticed in various context [8

10,31,23,32,11,33]. the gauge covariance (4) implies that the functional rota-

tion (9) possesses the following property:

z d8z v a(z)(cid:20)



v b(z)(cid:28) s

v a(z)(cid:29) 

=



v b(z)(cid:29)(cid:21)

v a(z)(cid:28) s
v b(z)z d8z v a(z)(cid:28) s



v a(z)(cid:29) .

(10)

the right hand side is nothing but the covariant anomaly (8). quite interest-

ingly, the functional rotation (9) is a local functional of the gauge supereld, being
proportional to (a derivative of) the delta function (z  z). we will see this

shortly. therefore, eq. (10) implies that, when the covariant anomaly vanishes,
i.e., when dabc = 0, the functional rotation vanishes and consequently our con-

sistent anomaly (7) entirely vanishes. thus the minimal-ness of the anomaly is

guaranteed by construction; this is the advantage of the prescription (2) and (3).

in non-supersymmetric gauge theories, one can obtain the functional rotation (9)

by solving the relation corresponding to eq. (10) [9]. instead, one may directly

evaluate eq. (9), as was performed in ref. [10] for non-supersymmetric gauge the-

ories. here we adopt the latter approach that seems much simpler for the present

supersymmetric case. this approach was also adopted in ref. [23].

7

to evaluate the functional rotation (9), we consider

1 h2si  2 h1si ,

(11)

where 1 and 2 are arbitrary variations of the gauge supereld v , being indepen-

dent of v itself. here, in the same way as the gauge current (3), the composite

operator hsi is regularized in a gauge covariant manner

in writing the last expression, we have used the identities (a.3) and (a.4). note

that, while originally the proper time in the gauge current (12) is belonging to
the ir region 1/m 2  t < , only the uv region 0  /m 2  1/m 2 (or
0  (1)/m 2  1/m 2) is contained in the combination (13). thus the functional

8

rotation (11) or (9) is a local quantity like the anomaly itself. thanks to the gauge

covariance, the evaluation of the last expression in plane wave basis is again simple

as is shown in appendix b. we have

 (cid:3) +(cid:8)2, dw(cid:9)(cid:17).

(14)

in spite of the asymmetric appearances of 1 and 2 in this expression, one can

conrm by using the reality constraint (a.2) that this is actually odd under the

exchange 1  2. from eq. (14), we can read o the left hand side of eq. (10):

d

 (cid:9)(cid:17),

which satises eq. (10) in conjunction with eq. (8); this fact provides the con-

sistency check of eq. (14). finally, from eqs. (7), (8) and (14), we obtain the

consistent gauge anomaly

.

here, as indicated, the quantities inside the round bracket are dened by sub-

stituting the gauge supereld v involved by gv . on the other hand, the gauge

variation v is given by eq. (5) as it stands without setting v  gv . it is obvious
that our consistent anomaly is proportional to the anomaly dabc, as expected.

9

as the simple but non-trivial check of eq. (16), we may consider the abelian

case for which the expression is considerably simplied. by noting v = i 

i in this case, we have  [v ] = (1 + 2/3)r d6z tr iw w/(642) + h.c.

this is one-third the covariant anomaly (8) and reproduces the correct result of

the consistent abelian anomaly. we note that, in our treatment, nothing special

(except simplicity of the expression) occurs in the abelian case.

in approaches

based on the wess-zumino consistency condition, strictly speaking, it is necessary

to start with the non-abelian case and then to take the abelian limit, because the

consistency condition becomes trivial in the abelian case.

one might ask whether the anomaly (16) actually satises the wess-zumino

consistency condition.

in fact, eq. (16) is identical to the consistent anomaly

due to marinkovic [24] up to the overall normalization factor (ours is four times
0 d egv gv egv
is abbreviated as sg. since the consistent anomaly in ref. [24] was constructed

smaller). see eq. (5) of ref. [24], where g is denoted as t andr 1

as the solution of the consistency condition, we may claim that we already know

eq. (16) actually satises the consistency condition.

it is interesting to examine the form of the anomaly (16) in the wess-zumino

(wz) gauge v = m + i2  i

2

 + 2

d/2 [25]. we rst set (z) = a(y)

for reproducing the usual gauge transformation (a is real). then we have

m(m  m)(cid:21).

(17)

this expression of the usual gauge anomaly in the wz gauge is surprisingly simple

compared to the result of existing eld theoretical calculations. we emphasize

again that we obtained eq. (17) without supplementing any counterterms. the

rst term is celebrated bardeens minimal anomaly [1] with the coecient for a

single chiral fermion. the second term, if one wishes, may be eliminated by adding

a non-supersymmetric local counterterm c as  [v ] + ac, where a is the usual

gauge transformation avm = 2dma and a = i[a, ]. the counterterm is given

10

by [24]

c =

1

3842z d4x tr vm(m  m).

(18)

as another interesting application, we may consider the anomalous break-

ing of the supersymmetry in the wz gauge, the so-called -susy anomaly [34].

the super-transformation in the wz gauge is a combination of the supersym-

metric transformation generated by q + q (which is not anomalous in the

present formulation [26]) and the gauge transformation  with the gauge pa-
rameter (z) = imvm(y)  2(y) [25]. therefore we have the (apparent)
breaking of supersymmetry as the consequence of the gauge anomaly. by setting

the gauge parameter  to this form in eq. (16), we have after some calculation,

 [v ]

m =

 c,

nklh2vn(kvl) + 2(nvk)vl +

2

vnvkvli(cid:27)

(19)
where  is the super-transformation in the wz gauge vm = im + h.c.,  =
mnvmn+id and d = dmm+h.c. eq. (19) shows that eq. (16) reproduces
the -susy anomaly given in ref. [34] again with the non-supersymmetric local

counterterm c (18). note that the structure of the counterterm (18) is quite

simple, compared to that of the counterterm required in ref. [34] for obtaining
the above form. our anomaly is proportional to dabc from the beginning and thus
the possible (non-supersymmetric) counterterm also must be proportional to dabc.

this fact severely restricts the possible form of counterterms.

in this letter, we have presented a (yet another) eld theoretical calculation

of the consistent gauge anomaly in the supereld formalism. as we have shown,

it is possible to fully utilize the advantage of gauge covariance, by dening the

eective action through the covariant gauge current (eqs. (2) and (3)). although

our result (16) itself has been known in the literature [24] (see also ref. [23]), this

11

is the rst time to our knowledge that an explicit eld theoretical calculation in

the supereld formalism directly led to the minimal consistent anomaly.

in this appendix, we illustrate the calculation of eq. (13) in plane wave basis.

basically the same calculation was performed in ref. [23] by using the heat kernel

expansion. first, in eq. (13), we note (x  x) = m 4r d4k eim k(xx)/(2)4 and

in writing this expression, we have omitted terms in which  or   explicitly
appears; the reason for this is the following. the supereld, such as eq. (13),
cannot have a term which explicitly contains  or  , because such a term has
no rst ( =  = 0) component and thus has no higher components (the higher

components of the supereld are uniquely determined by the linearly realized super-
transformation of the rst component [25]). therefore those terms in which  or  
explicitly appears must eventually be canceled out, or, if these contribute,  must

13

be eliminated by d (or   by d
conrm that when d eliminates  (or when d



). however, in the original form of (b.2), one can



eliminates  ), the corresponding

term does not have enough powers of m to survive in the m   limit, or does

not have a sucient number of spinor derivatives to eliminate the delta function:

in the equal point limit  =  and  = 



, only those terms with which just four

spinor derivatives acting on the delta function survive [25]:

 (  )(cid:12)(cid:12)= = 2,

d d  (  



)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=

 = 2  .

(b.3)

in short, the terms in which  or   explicitly appears must be canceled out.
this cancellation may directly be veried as was done in ref. [26] in a similar

calculation.

the expansion of eq. (b.2) in powers of 1/m is easy. after the integration

over km and , one can readily verify (say, by substituting m = m + m) that

the terms contain the vector covariant derivative m are combined into a total

divergence. thus vector covariant derivatives do not contribute. in this way, we
