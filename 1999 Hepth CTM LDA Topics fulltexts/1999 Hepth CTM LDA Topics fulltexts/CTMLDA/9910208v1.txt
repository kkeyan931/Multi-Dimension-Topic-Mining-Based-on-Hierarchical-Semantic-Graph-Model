abstract

we consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric su (n ) with one massive
avour. in particular, for n  3 we explicitly construct the elementary domain
wall that interpolates between two contiguous vacua. we show that these solutions
are bps saturated for any value of the mass of the matter elds. we also comment
on their large n limit and their relevance for supersymmetric gluodynamics.

the study of supersymmetric gauge theories
that are in the strong coupling regime has been
intensied recently by the realization that some
of their constructions could admit exact solutions.
in particular, the issue of domain walls in su(n)
supersymmetric gluodynamics, the theory of gluons
and gluinos, is one of the most exciting ones. these
walls arise because this theory has an axial u(1)
symmetry broken by the anomaly to a discrete
z2n chiral symmetry. due to non-perturbative
eects gluino condensates (hi) form, breaking the
symmetry further down to z2. this leaves us with
a set of n dierent vacua labelled by

htri = 3e2ik/n k = 0, 1, ..., n  1 ,

(1)

where  is the condensation scale, and, as indicated
above, a set of domain walls interpolating between
them. if we assume that they are bps saturated,
the energy density of
is exactly
calculable and given by [1, 2, 3]

these walls

82 |htri  htri| ,

in fact, it has been shown in ref. [4] that, in the
large n limit, these domain walls are bps states.
on the other hand, these solutions preserving half
of the supersymmetry would play an important role
in the d-brane description of n = 1 sqcd [5].

in order to get to study pure gluodynamics, it
is convenient to add matter elds to the theory and
analyze the limit where these extra elds (usually
taken to be pairs of chiral superelds transforming
as (n, n ) under the colour group) become very
heavy.
in the strong coupling regime, we should
expect the formation of squark condensates. these
models were considered in refs [6, 7], for the case
of (n  1) avours. their analysis of the vaccuum

structure led to the conclusion that the existence of
bps saturated domain walls was restricted to values
for the mass m of the squark elds below a certain
critical one.
it therefore looked like it would be
impossible to recover pure gluodynamics by taking
the limit m  , and this is precisely the main
issue we will address during this talk.

in order to do that let us consider supersym-
metric qcd with su (n ) gauge group and one
couple of chiral superelds (q, q) transforming as
n, n . non-perturbative eects become relevant at
the scale , where condensates form. the gaugino
and squark colourless condensates are described by
the following composite elds

s =

3
322 trw 2 ,

m = q q ,

(3)

where w 2 is the composite chiral supereld whose
lowest component is .
in this regime, the
relevant degrees of freedom are described by a wess-
zumino model, as shown in ref. [8].
its eective
langrangian is given by

l =

where k is the kahler potential and w is the
superpotential

w =

(5)

with m the mass for the matter superelds. this
superpotential has n extrema labeled by the
dierent phases of the gaugino condensate. at the
minimum we have the gaugino condensate xed to

the matter condensate is aligned with respect to
the former and given by

(7)

we want to study domain wall congurations that
interpolate between the dierent minima. here
a technical problem appears:
the superpotential
has several branches associated with its logarithmic
piece [9].
in the pure susy gluodynamics
limit described by veneziano and yankielowicz [8]
this is a severe problem, since any conguration
connecting two vacua has to cross this branch. this
is not necessarily the case when we include other
elds, given that the variation in the phase of the
gaugino condensate can be partially compensated
by these new elds. in this case, this will be done
by matter elds.

let (s, m )a be a particular vacuum. we
can continuously deform it into another vacuum,
(s, m )b. for this path in the conguration space,
we dene , w such that

s|b = eis|a ,

m |b = ei(+2w)m |a .

(8)

(7) implies that w must be some
notice that eq.
integer number. on the other hand, one necessary
condition to avoid crossing the logarithmic branch
along this path is

(n  1) + ( + 2w) = 0 .

(9)

since we are interested in congurations interpo-
lating between the vacua i and i  1, we will x
 =  2

n and then w = 1.

if we assume that there is a bps domain wall
connecting these two vacua, it will be described by
the following dierential equations

i = ei w

(10)

where k  is the induced metric from the kahler
potential k, and  is given by

(11)

the conguration is described by four real functions

notice that we have dened (z), r(z) in such a
way that () = r() = 1. on the other
hand,  varies from 0 to 2(1  1/n ) and  from
0 to 2/n . a consistent ansatz under reection
z  z is given by: (z) = (z), r(z) = r(z),
(z) = 2/n  (z) and (z) = 2(1  1/n ) 
(z). these relations x the boundary conditions
at z = 0. eqs (10) imply the following bps
constraint

im(cid:2)eiw(s, m )(cid:3) = const .

(13)

in refs [6, 7] a similar analysis was presented
for nf = n  1 couples of matter elds. in these
papers it was shown that these domain walls are
bps states only for squark masses lower than some
critical value, m, that depends on n and the
kahler potential. the existence of this bound is
related to the presence of two dierent bps domain
wall solutions for small enough values of m, which
became identical at the critical value.

here we have worked in detail a dierent case:
n = 3, nf = 1, using the same kahler potential,
i.e. k = (s s)1/3 + (m m )1/2. we have found
that the equations can be solved for all values of
the squark mass, and we have checked that the
logarithmic branch is never crossed. the proles for
r are shown in fig. 1 for several values of m (given
in units of ), focusing on their central region. the
spatial coordinate z is expressed in units of 1,
where  = ( 3m
4 )1/3n is the eective qcd scale
that arises in the large m limit.

in our case there is only one bps solution for
every value of m. this can be understood analyzing
both the large and small m limit, as explained in
detail in [10]. these limits depend on the number
of avours.

let us consider the limit m  , that is
expected to describe pure gluodynamics. from
fig. 1 we see that there is a well dened gaugino
condensate prole in that limit.
in fact, the
following constraints apply in the asymptotic
regions

(z)ei(z) = r(z)ei(z) (z << 1/m) ,

(14)

(z)ei(z) = r(z)ei((z)2) (z >> 1/m) .

therefore, using eq. (14) in this large m limit
we can get rid of  and  in the bps equations.
also the bps constraint involves only the gaugino
condensate and can be written as

m (z) = |m| (z)ei(z) ,

s(z) = |s| r(z)ei(z) .

(12)

imnei[+(z)]r(z)hln(cid:16)r(z)ei (z)(cid:17)  1io = const ,

expects [4, 5]

(19)
then, we have to replace 3 by n 3 in the
above equations. this implies that the energy of
the previous elementary domain wall, as given by
eq. (2), scales like   o(n ). if we want to study
the width, i.e. how the energy is spread along the
domain wall, we need some information about the
n dependence of kinetic terms of both gaugino and
regulator -matter- elds.

for example,

if we assume that the gaugino

kinetic term term is o(n a), then r(z) is given by

r(z) as dened in eqs (12) versus z (in units of 1), for
m = 2 (dotted line), 20 (dash-dotted), 100 (dashed), 200
(solid). the thick solid line corresponds to the m  
solution given by eq. (16).

where (z) = (z) for z < 0 and (z) = (z) +
2/n for z > 0. this constraint allows us to
express  as a function of r, and we end up with
the following bps equation for r(z)

|z|r(|z|) = k2 n 1ar(|z|) ,

(20)

where the precise value of the positive constant
k2 depends on the particular kahler potential.
under this assumption, the scale associated with
the gaugino eld variations is o(1/(n 1a)).

in summary, it is possible to build bps domain
walls in sqcd with one avour for any value of
the mass of the matter elds. this allows us to
study the limit where the theory approaches pure
supersymmetric gluodynamics.

notice that, in the large m limit, the prole has two
branches which are smoothly connected for nite
values of m.
in this limit, the domain wall has
two typical scales. one is associated to the gaugino
condensate, while the other one is associated to the
additional eld that compensates the phase changes
of the gaugino condensate, in our case the matter
eldk.

let us now analyze the large n limit of this
asymptotic conguration [11]. in order to do that
we expand the normalized modulus

r(z) = 1  r(z)/n + o(1/n 2) ,

(17)

and we rewrite (z) = b(z) 2
implies

n . then eq. (15)

b(z) = r(z)

for the left branch, i.e.
for z < 0. if we want to
analyze the structure of the domain wall, we have
