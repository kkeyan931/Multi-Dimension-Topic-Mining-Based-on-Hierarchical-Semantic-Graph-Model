abstract

we use the ads/cft correspondence to calculate three point functions of chiral
primary operators at large n in d = 3, n = 8 and d = 6, n = (2, 0) superconformal
eld theories. these theories are related to the infrared xed points of world-volume

descriptions of n coincident m2 and m5 branes, respectively.

the computation can be generalized by employing a gravitational action in arbitrary
dimensions d, coupled to a (p + 1)-form and appropriately compactied on ads(dp2) 
s(p+2). we note a surprising coincidence: this generalized model reproduces for d = 10,
p = 3 the three point functions of d = 4, n = 4 sym chiral primary operators at large n .

the ads/cft correspondence [1][2][3] has been quite useful in learning various prop-

erties of strongly coupled quantum elds theories at large n (for reviews see [4][5].) in

particular, it has been employed in [6] to compute two and three point functions at large
n for chiral primary operators (cpo) of d = 4, n = 4 super yang-mills (sym) theory by
making use of type iib supergravity compactied on ads5  s5.

this interesting result has been generalized in [7] to the case of the d = 6, n = (2, 0)
superconformal eld theory (scft) related to the infrared xed point of the world-volume

description of n coincident m5 branes. this is a remarkable theory which seems to require

a generalization of non-abelian gauge theories, where the gauge potential should be though

of a two-form with self-dual eld strength. a lagrangian formulation of this theory is not

known, yet, but there exists a dlcq matrix description as quantum mechanics on the

moduli space of instantons [8]. the ads/cft conjecture has provided new clues on this

somewhat unaccessible theory.

both theories described above have maximal supersymmetry, corresponding to the

existence of 16 real supercharges (for a review see [9] and references therein). in this letter

we complete the program of computing two and three point functions of chiral primary

operators at large n for the remaining known maximally supersymmetric conformal eld
theory: the d = 3, n = 8 scft. this theory can be realized as the infrared xed point
of n coincident m2 branes. it is a quite mysterious theory without an explicitly known

lagrangian realization, though it can be seen to describe the strongly coupled infrared xed
point of d = 3, n = 8 sym. a kind of dlcq matrix description is also unknown, and the
ads/cft conjecture oers a unique chance to learn more about its properties. with this

aim in mind, we set out to compute the three point functions of chiral primary operators.

for this purpose the ads/cft correspondence instruct us to: i) identify the kaluza-klein
tower of scalar excitations with lowest mass arising from 11d supergravity on ads4  s7,
ii) compute the quadratic and cubic part of their action. this will produce the correlation

functions of interest by using the ads/cft relations. the conformal dimensions of the

chiral primary operators have already been identied by using maldacenas conjecture in

[10].

we start from the bosonic part of the 11d supergravity action which is given by

s =

22 z d11x (cid:20)g(cid:16) 1

f 2(cid:17) +

a  f  f(cid:21)

(1)

where f = da3 is the eld strength of the 3-form amnp. one can check that on the
ads4  s7 background the chern-simon term is never excited by the quadratic and cubic

1

uctuations of the scalar eld of interest, which we denote by s. thus, for our purposes,

the chern-simon term can be dropped from the beginning. at this stage we also notice

that a more convenient dual formulation with a 6-form a6, instead of the original 3-form
a3, can be used. as shown in [11], this has the advantage that the scalar eld s is suitably
described o-shell by a linear combination of two scalars (namely, the deformation of the

trace of the metric on the sphere and a scalar deformation of the 6-form potential on the

sphere; in the original 3-form formulation this second scalar excitation would have been

described o-shell by a vector eld).

the proposed simplied model captures all of the physical information we need to

extract from 11d supergravity. it is also evident that one can generalize it by considering

a gravitational action in arbitrary dimensions d with metric gmn coupled to a (p + 1)-form

where f = dap+1 is the p + 2 form describing the eld strength. for d = 11, p = 5 this
gives the dual formulation described above, and constitutes the main object of our analysis.

for d = 11, p = 2 it gives the usual description of 11d supergravity with fermions and

chern-simon term set to zero.

where 1..p+2 denotes the standard volume form on the sphere and e is an arbitrary mass
scale parameterizing the compactication. note the splitting of d-dimensional coordinates
xm = (z, y)  (ads(dp2), s(p+2)). also, it will be convenient to use the notation
e2 = a2, since e gives directly the inverse radius of the sphere. the (p + 1)-form ap+1

couples naturally to electric p-branes, though the solution just described is generated by
magnetic (d  p  4)-brane sources. in fact, the fp+2 eld strength has non-trivial ux
on the sphere s(p+2) surrounding the (d  p  4)-dimensional source.

bulk elds of interest are uctuations about the ads(dp2)s(p+2) background. for

our needs, we dene them as follows (now we denote eld variables as gmn, am1..mp+1, fm1..mp+2
and their background values as gmn, am1..mp+1, fm1..mp+2 ):

hmn = gmn  gmn,
fm1..mp+2 = fm1..mp+2  fm1..mp+2,
ea1..p+1 = 1..p+1

fm1m2..mp+2 = (p + 2) [m1am2..mp+2],

(5)

in the following we will drop bars on background elds, since no confusion can arise.

last equation denes the scalar eld b. it is the unique physical uctuation contained in

a1..p+1, since we have chosen to x reparametrization and (p + 1)-form gauge invariance
on the sphere by imposing the gauge choices h() = h = am2..mp+1 = 0,
1   and
where h() denotes the traceless part of h. we use the notation
2   to denote the dalembertian on ads and the laplacian on s, respectively
(subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the rst and second factor of the ads  s manifold).

using this notation we nd from eqs. (3) the following linearized coupled equations

for the (h2, b) scalars

these equations can be easily diagonalized. introducing a complete orthonormal set of
2y i = e2k(k + p + 1)y i, where k is a non-
scalar spherical harmonics y i satisfying

negative integer depending on the index i, and the harmonic expansions

we have chosen a suitable normalization of the diagonal elds such that the inverse rela-

tions are simple:

2 = 2(p + 2)(d  p  3)(cid:16)ksi + (k + p + 1)ti(cid:17),
hi
bi = (p + 1)(d  2)(si  ti ).

(11)

as a check, we notice that for this particular set of scalar elds we have reproduced the

masses worked out in refs.
[13] for
the ads7  s4 one. the elds si describe the kaluza-klein tower of ads scalars with
lowest mass. to linear order they correspond to the chiral primary operators in scft,

[12] for the ads4  s7 compactication, and in ref.

and they will be the focus of our analysis throughout the rest of this paper. the scalars

ti , on the other hand, correspond to descendents of these chiral primary operators, and

for the present purposes they can be set to zero.

having obtained some insights into the diagonal elds si , we now derive their

quadratic o-shell action starting from eq. (2). proceeding as described in refs. [11][14],

one can decouple the (h2, b) sector from h by parameterizing the latter as

h =  +  +

1

(d  p  2)

g .

(12)

requiring a decoupling at the quadratic level between (h2, b) and  xes  and  ap-

propriately. at higher orders the decoupling can be dealt with eld redenitions. thus,

one can immediately proceed to identify the quadratic si o-shell action together with

their cubic self-couplings. a laborious calculation produces the following action (with
d = d  p  3)

(16)

the modes with k = 0, 1 decouple from the action and correspond to some global gauge

degree of freedom.

in obtaining these results we have used various denitions for the

spherical harmonics, similar to those employed in [6]. namely, we describe the n-sphere
of radius  = e1 by sn  {~y 2 = 2 | ~y  rn+1}, and use scalar spherical harmonics
xi1 ...xik, where the coordinates xi = eyi live on the unit sphere
dened by y i = ci
and the tensors ci
sors. orthonormality reads as ci
so(n + 1) scalar contraction of three tensors ci

i1...ik form an orthonormal basis for completely symmetric traceless ten-
i1...ikcj,i1...ik = ij , while hci1ci2ci3i denotes the unique

returning to the values of the cubic couplings gi1i2i3 given in eq. (15), we note that
they simplify for the ads4,7,5 s7,4,5 cases, since then the coecient  = 0. in particular,
dening gi1i2i3 = gi1i2i3 ai1i2i3hci1ci2ci3i, we obtain

we are now ready to compute two and three point functions in the scfts using the

the factors wi parameterize unknown proportionality constants which relate the elds
si to the sources of the operators oi , as in [6]. these factors can presumably be xed
by carefully studying absorption processes on the branes [16]. however, for the present

purposes we follow ref. [6] and x them to normalize the two point functions as

hoi(x)oj (y)i =

we rst study the case of ads4  s7, which corresponds to scft3 at large n and
constitutes our main interest. to match the ads4  s7 solution to the near horizon
2825 . also, to
geometry of n m2 branes we tune the gravitational coupling
employ the formulas given above, we need to x the ads radius to one by setting the
mass parameter e = 1

this is the ads/cft prediction for the normalized cpo three point functions in scft3

at large n .

our general formulation can also produce the cpo three point functions in scft6.

in fact, the chern-simon terms doesnt give any contribution in this case as well, and it
can be neglected from the start. thus, we turn immediately to the ads7  s4 case and
set the ads7 radius to one by xing 1
5 and e = 2. the masses of the scalars si
x the conformal dimensions of the operators oi to be i = 2k so that

this essentially conrms the results already obtained in [7] (apart from a factor 
present there for which we cannot nd agreement). the three point couplings for the si

scalars at level k = 2 (and the corresponding three point functions) could in principle be

extracted also from ref. [17], where the complete consistent kaluza-klein reduction of 11d
supergravity on ads7  s4 has been worked out. however, it is not straightforward to
extract the cubic couplings from the lagrangian given there, since one should rst perform
some gauge-xing to identify the physical scalars si.

finally, we consider our model on ads5  s5. using the ads/cft correspondence
we can obtain correlation functions for the operators oi corresponding to the scalars si.
the result will not be obviously related to d = 4, n = 4 sym theory, since in the latter
case the sources for the dual gravitational model must be self-dual 3-branes, i.e. branes

with both electric and magnetic charges. nevertheless, to satisfy our curiosity we compute

the correlation functions. we set the ads radius to 1 by xing e = 1. we also set the
gravitational coupling to 1
45 , as would have been appropriate to the near horizon

22 = n 2

geometry of n d3 branes. this time the si masses x the conformal dimensions of the

operators to be i = k and we get

ri1i2i3 =

1

npk1k2k3 hci1ci2ci3i.

(27)

surprisingly, this reproduces the d = 4, n = 4 sym results at large n obtained in [6]. we
have no immediate explanation for this coincidence.

to conclude, we have used the ads/cft conjecture to predict the normalized three

point correlation functions of the chiral primary operators in scft3 and scft6. the
rst result is new, while the latter essentially conrms the ndings of ref.
[7]. adapting
our calculation to the ads5  s5 case, we have noticed that our model reproduces the
normalized three point functions at large n for the d = 4, n = 4 sym theory.

we plan to present more details of our computation in a future publication, possibly
producing additional correlation functions involving scalar operators related to the ti elds.
