we study the deformation quantization of scalar and abelian gauge classical free elds.

stratonovich-weyl quantizer, star-products and wigner functionals are obtained in eld

and oscillator variables. abelian gauge theory is particularly intriguing since wigner func-

tional is factorized into a physical part and other one containing the constraints only.

some eects of non-trivial topology within deformation quantization formalism are also

considered.

1. introduction

recently a great deal of works have been done in deformation quantization theory.

deformation quantization was originally proposed by bayen et al.1 as an alternative to

the standard procedure of quantization avoiding the more dicult problem of constructing

the relevant hilbert space of the system. in these pioneer works it was proposed a way of

quantizing a classical system by deforming the corresponding algebraic structures. dier-

ent mathematical aspects of deformation quantization were also further explored. among

them, the existence proofs of a star-product for any symplectic manifold24 and also for

a poisson manifold5. the latter result has been motivated in part by string theory. a full

treatment of the interplay between string theory and deformation quantization and, more

generally, noncommutative geometry was given very recently by seiberg and witten6.

deformation quantization was mainly applied to quantize classical mechanics. how-

ever, it seems to be very interesting to formulate quantum eld theory within deformation

quantization program. recently some works on this subject have been done712.

our paper is motivated by those works and we attempt to show systematically how all

the deformation quantization formalism (stratonovich-weyl quantizer, grossmann opera-

tor, weyl correspondence, moyal star-product, wigner function, etc.) can be carry over

to quantum eld theory. to this end we use the well known particle interpretation of free

elds. this approach in the case of scalar eld was rst considered by dito7,8

in this interpretation many formulas seem to be more natural and in a sense the

deformation quantization in terms of particle interpretation justies the respective formulas

of the previous works912, given in eld variable language.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we consider deformation quantization
in scalar eld theory. stratonovich-weyl quantizer, grossmann operator, moyal -product
and wigner functional are dened in terms of the eld variables. in section 3, the same

is given for free scalar elds with the use of normal coordinates. wigner functional of the

ground state is found and also wigner functional for higher states is considered. finally, the

normal ordering within deformation quantization program is given. section 4 is devoted to

deformation quantization of free electromagnetic eld. the constraints (gausss law) are

analyzed in some detail. perhaps the most interesting result is that the wigner functional

1

can be factorized so that one part contains only the transverse components of the eld and

the second part contains the longitudinal variables and this part vanishes when constraints

are not satised. finally, in section 5 we consider the casimir eect in terms of deformation

quantization formalism.

this paper is the rst one of a series of papers which we are going to dedicate to

deformation quantization of classical elds. the next one deals with interacting and self-

interacting elds.

2. deformation quantization in scalar field theory

consider a real scalar eld on minkowski space time of signature (+, +, +, ). canon-
ical variables of this eld will be denoted by (x, t) and (x, t) with (x, t)  r3  r. we
deal with elds at the instant t = 0 and we put (x, 0)  (x) and (x, 0)  (x). it is
worth to mention that some of the functional formulas and their manipulations of sec.2

and 3, will be formal.

2.1. the stratonovich-weyl quantizer

let f [, ] be a functional on the phase space z and let ef [, ] be its fourier trans-

form

ef [, ] =z ddexp(cid:26)  iz dx(cid:18)(x)(x) + (x)(x)(cid:19)(cid:27)f [, ].

the functional measures are given by d =qx d(x), d =qx d(x). by analogy

to quantum mechanics13 we dene the weyl quantization rule as follows

f = w (f [, ]) :=z d(


2


2

)d(

)ef [, ] u[, ],

where { u[, ] : (, )  z } is a family of unitary operators

2

(2.1)

(2.2)

u[, ] := exp(cid:26)iz dx(cid:18)(x) (x) + (x) (x)(cid:19)(cid:27),

(2.3)

with  and  being the eld operators given by (x)|i = (x)|i and (x)|i = (x)|i.
using the well known campbell-baker-hausdor formula and the standard commu-

tation rules for  and  one can write u[, ] in the following form

u[, ] = exp(cid:26) 

ih

2 z dx(x)(x)(cid:27)exp(cid:26)iz dx(x) (x)(cid:27)exp(cid:26)iz dx(x) (x)(cid:27)

2 z dx(x)(x)(cid:27)exp(cid:26)iz dx(x) (x)(cid:27)exp(cid:26)iz dx(x) (x)(cid:27).

= exp(cid:26) ih
employing eqs. (2.4) and the relations r d|ih| = 1 and r d( 

easily get

(2.4)

2h )|ih| = 1 we

u[, ] =z d(


2h

)exp(cid:26)iz dx(x)(x)(cid:27)| +

h
2 ih 

h
2 |

=z dexp(cid:26)iz dx(x)(x)(cid:27)| 

h
2 ih +

h
2 |.

this operator satises the following properties

and

t r(cid:26) u[, ](cid:27) =z dh| u[, ]|i = (cid:2) h

2(cid:3)[]

t r(cid:26) u [, ] u[, ](cid:27) = [

h
2

(  )][  ].

(compare with refs. 14 and 15).

substituing (2.1) into (2.2) one has

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

f = w (f [, ]) =z dd(


2h

3

)f [, ] [, ],

(2.8)

where  is given by

[, ] =z d(

h
2

)dexp(cid:26)  iz dx(cid:18)(x)(x) + (x)(x)(cid:19)(cid:27) u[, ].

(2.9)

it is evident that the operator  dened by (2.9) is the quantum eld analog of the well

known stratonovich-weyl quantizer playing an important role in deformation quantization
of classical mechanics1621. therefore we call our  the stratonovich-weyl quantizer. one
can easily check the following properties of 

(cid:0) [, ](cid:1)
=(cid:0) [, ](cid:1),
t r(cid:8) [, ](cid:9) = 1,

t r(cid:26) [, ] [, ](cid:27) = [  ][

  
2h

].

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

multipliying (2.8) by [, ], taking the trace of both sides and using (2.12) we get

f [, ] = t r(cid:26) [, ] f(cid:27).

(2.13)

one can also express [, ] in a very useful form by inserting (2.5) into (2.9). thus

one gets

[, ] =z d(



2h

i

hz dx(x)(x)(cid:27)| +

)exp(cid:26) 
hz dx(x)(x)(cid:27)| 

=z dexp(cid:26) 

i


2ih 


2|


2ih +


2|.

(2.14)

(2.15)

consider now the operator

i :=

1

2z d(2)|ih|.

using (2.15) we can dene the eld analog of the grossmann operator22,14,15 as follows

4

i[, ] := u [, ] i =

1

2z d(2)exp(cid:26)iz dx(x)(cid:18)(x) 

h(x)

2 (cid:19)(cid:27)|  hih|

1

2z d(2)exp(cid:26)iz dx(x)(x)(cid:27)| 

=

h
2 ih 

h
2 |.

comparing (2.14) with (2.16) one quickly nds that

[, ] = 2 i(cid:20) 2

h

, 

hence [0, 0] = 2 i and consequently

2

h (cid:21) = u(cid:20) 2

h

2

h (cid:21)2 i.

, 

[, ] = u(cid:20) 2

h

2

h (cid:21) [0, 0].

, 

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

simple manipulations show that (2.18) can be also written in the following form

[, ] = u(cid:20) 

h

= u(cid:20) 

h

, 



h(cid:21) [0, 0] u
, 
h(cid:21) [0, 0] u(cid:20) 



h

(cid:20) 
, 
h(cid:21).


h



,



h(cid:21)

(2.19)

it is interesting to note that similarly as in the quantum mechanics22 one can nd

the relation between the stratonovich-weyl quantizer and the quantum eld image of the

dirac . namely we have

 := w(cid:18)[](cid:20) 

2h(cid:21)(cid:19)

=z dd(


2h

)[][


2h

] [, ] = [0, 0] = 2 i.

(2.20)

2.2. the star product

now we are in a position to dene the moyal -product in eld theory. let
f1 = f1[, ] and f2 = f2[, ] be some functionals on z that correspond to the

5

eld operators f1 and f2 respectively, i.e. f1[, ] = w 1( f1) = t r(cid:0) [, ] f1(cid:1) and
f2[, ] = w 1( f2) = t r(cid:0) [, ] f2(cid:1). the question is to nd the functional which cor-
responds to the product f1 f2. this functional will be denoted by (f1  f2)[, ] and we
call it the moyal -product23,1. so we have

(f1  f2)[, ] := w 1( f1 f2) = t r(cid:26) [, ] f1 f2(cid:27).

(2.21)

substituting (2.8) into (2.21) and performing simple calculations one gets

(f1  f2)[, ] =z d()d()d(cid:0) 

h(cid:1)d(cid:0) 

h(cid:1)f1[, ]

exp(cid:26) 2i

h z dx(cid:18)(  )(  )  (  )(  )(cid:19)(cid:27)f2[, ].

(2.22)

to proceed further we introduce new variables  =   ,  =   ,  =
,  = . using the expasion of f1[, ] = f1[+, +] and f2[, ] =
f2[ + ,  + ] in taylor series and after some laborious manipulations (in principle

very similar to the ones given in ref. 21) we obtain

(cid:0)f1  f2(cid:1)[, ] = f1[, ]exp(cid:26) ih

2.3. the wigner functional

finally we are going to dene the wigner functional. let  be the density operator

of a quantum state. the functional [, ] corresponding to  reads (see (2.13))

[, ] = t r(cid:26) [, ](cid:27) =z dexp(cid:26) 

i

hz dx(x)(x)(cid:27)h +


2|| 


2i.

(2.26)

then in analogy to quantum mechanics24,25,26 the wigner functional w [, ] corre-

sponding to the state  is dened by

w [, ] :=z d(
2h
for  = |ih| (2.27) gives

2|| 


2i.

(2.27)

w [, ] =z d(

)exp(cid:26) 

i

hz dx(x)(x)(cid:27)[ 


2

2

]

(2.28)

according to ref. 12.

[important remark: it must be noted that many, perhaps most, of our formulas are de-

ned only formally. this resembles the case of the path integral theory. we expect that

further development of the formalism presented in this paper will provide us with better

mathematical frame.]

3. free scalar field

in this section we deal with free real scalar eld of the action2730

s[] =z dxdtl((x, t), (x, t)) = 

1

2z dxdt(  m22),

(3.1)

where  = 1, . . . , 4 (we put c = 1). the conjugate eld momentum is (x, t) = l
( )
(x, t), where   

t . then the hamiltonian reads

=

7

h[, ] =

1

2z dx(cid:18)(x, t)2 + ((x, t))2 + m2(x, t)2(cid:19).

(3.2)

the eld (x, t) satises the klein-gordon equation (m2)(x, t) = 0. for (x, t)

and (x, t) we have the usual poisson brackets

{(x, t), (y, t)} = (x  y),

{(x, t), (y, t)} = 0 = {(x, t), (y, t)}.

(3.3)

consider the standard expansion of  and 

(x, t) =

1

(2)3/2 z dk(cid:18) h

2(k)(cid:19)1/2(cid:18)a(k, t)exp{ikx} + a(k, t)exp{ikx}(cid:19),

(x, t) = (x, t) =

1

(2)3/2 z dk i(cid:18) (k)h

2 (cid:19)1/2(cid:18)a(k, t)exp{ikx}  a(k, t)exp{ikx}(cid:19),

where (k) = k2 + m2, a(k, t) = a(k)exp(cid:8)  i(k)t(cid:9) and kx  kjxj, j = 1, 2, 3.

from (3.4) we get

a(k, t) =

(2)3/2(2(k)h)1/2 z dx exp(cid:8)  ikx(cid:9)(cid:18)(k)(x, t) + i(x, t)(cid:19).

1

one can easily check that (3.3) and (3.5) give

(3.4)

(3.5)

{a(k, t), a(k, t)} = 

i
h

(k  k),

{a(k, t), a(k, t)} = 0 = {a(k, t), a(k, t)}.

(3.6)

8

3.1. canonical transformation

then we introduce new canonical eld variables31,32

h

2(k)(cid:1)1/2(cid:18)a(k, t) + a(k, t)(cid:19), p (k, t) := i(cid:0) h(k)

2

(cid:1)1/2(cid:18)a(k, t)  a(k, t)(cid:19).

(3.7)

q(k, t) :=(cid:0)

hence

a(k, t) =(cid:0) (k)

2h (cid:1)1/2(cid:18)q(k, t) +

i

(k)

p (k, t)(cid:19).

(3.8)

from (3.6) and (3.7) one has

{q(k, t), p (k, t)} = (k  k),

{q(k, t), q(k, t)} = 0 = {p (k, t), p (k, t)}.

(3.9)

inserting (3.5) into (3.7) we obtain

q(k, t) =

p (k, t) =

1

(2)3/2(k)z dx(cid:18)(x, t)sin(kx) + (k)(x, t)cos(kx)(cid:19),
(2)3/2 z dx(cid:18)(x, t)cos(kx)  (k)(x, t)sin(kx)(cid:19).

1

then the inverse transformation reads

(x, t) =

(x, t) =

1

sin(kx)(cid:19),
(2)3/2 z dk(cid:18)q(k, t)cos(kx) 
(2)3/2 z dk(cid:18)(k)q(k, t)sin(kx) + p (k, t)cos(kx)(cid:19).

p (k, t)
(k)

1

(3.10)

(3.11)

we now consider the eld at the instant t = 0. from (3.9) it follows that (3.10) denes
a linear canonical transformation. consequently the measure dd = dqdp and all the
formalism given before can be easily expressed in terms of new variables q and p .

9

3.2. the stratonovich-weyl quantizer

eqs. (2.8) and (2.9) can be rewritten in the following form

f =z dqd(

p
2h

)f [[q, p ], [q, p ]] [[q, p ], [q, p ]]

(3.12)

and

[[q, p ], [q, p ]] =z d(

h
2

)dexp(cid:26)  iz dk(cid:18)(k)q(k) + (k)p (k)(cid:19)(cid:27)

exp(cid:26)iz dk(cid:18)(k) q(k) + (k) p (k)(cid:19)(cid:27)

(3.13)

with q and p the eld operators and corresponding states |qi and |pi satisfying the rela-
tions: q(k)|qi = q(k)|qi, p (k)|pi = p (k)|pi,r dq|qihq| = 1 andr d( p
2h )|pihp| = 1.
further on we denote the stratonovich-weyl quantizer [[q, p ], [q, p ]] simply by

[q, p ]. then

[q, p ] =z d(



2h

i

i


2ihq +


2|.

(3.14)

it is evident how to write the grossmann operator within the (q, p ) formalism, so we

do not consider this here.

3.3. star product and wigner functional

one easily shows that the moyal -product can be now expressed by

(cid:0)f1  f2(cid:1)[q, p ] = f1[q, p ]exp(cid:26) ih

2



p (cid:27)f2[q, p ],

10



p:=z dk(cid:18) 



q(k)




p (k) 




p (k)




q(k)(cid:19).

finally, the wigner functional in the (q, p ) formalism is given by

w [q, p ] =z d(



2h

)exp(cid:26) 

i

hz dk(k)p (k)(cid:27)hq +


2||q 


2i,

where w [q, p ] means w [[q, p ], [q, p ]]. then for  = |ih| one has

(3.15)

(3.16)

w [q, p ] =z d(
now we are going to nd the wigner functional for the ground state |0i. from the

hz dk(k)p (k)(cid:27)[q 

)exp(cid:26) 

][q +

(3.17)


2

].

2h

i

very denition of |0i

substituting (3.8) and using the q representation we get the functional equation

a(k)|0i = 0.

(3.18)

hence

(cid:18)q(k) +

h

(k)



q(k)(cid:19)0[q] = 0.

0[q]  exp(cid:26) 

1

2hz dk(k)q2(k)(cid:27).

(3.19)

(3.20)

finally, inserting (3.20) into (3.17) and performing some straightforward calculations

one nds the wigner functional w 0 of the ground state to be

w 0 [q, p ]  exp(cid:26) 

1

hz

dk

(k)(cid:18)p 2(k) + 2(k)q2(k)(cid:19)(cid:27).

(3.21)

employing (3.10) we obtain the wigner functional of the ground state in terms of

(, )

11

w 0 [, ]  exp(cid:26)

1

hz dx(cid:18)(x)(p2

x + m2)(x)(cid:19) +(cid:18)(x)(p2

x + m2)1(x)(cid:19)(cid:27)

(3.22)

according to ref. 12.

comparing the wigner functional (3.21) with the harmonic oscillator wigner function

given in refs. 26, 33 and 34 we conclude that the former one represents the wigner function

of innite number of harmonic oscillators. its nothing strange as the variables q and p

are the eld theoretical analogs of normal coordinates and their conjugate momenta.

3.4. oscillator variables and ordering

now one can easily nd the wigner functionals corresponding to higher states. let
(k(n)) . . .|0i be the higher quantum

| . . . k . . . k . . . k(n) . . .i = . . . a
state of the scalar eld. the density operator  reads

(k) . . . a

(k) . . . a







(...k...k...k(n)...)  . . . a



(k) . . . a



(k) . . . a



(k(n)) . . .|0ih0| . . . a(k(n)) . . . a(k) . . . a(k) . . .

(3.23)

with a(k) and a



(k) being the annihilation and creation operators, respectively. hence the

corresponding wigner functional is



w (...k ...k ...k(n) ...)

[a, a]  . . . a(k) . . . a(k) . . . a(kn) . . . w 0[a, a] . . . a(kn)

where by (3.7) and (3.21)

. . .  a(k)  . . .  a(k)  . . . ,

w 0 [a, a]  exp(cid:26)  2z dka(k)a(k)(cid:27).

(3.24)

(3.25)

the moyal -product operator in terms of a(k) and a(k) can be written as follows7

12

 = exp(cid:26) ih

2



p (cid:27) = exp(cid:26) 1

2z dk(cid:18) 



a(k)




a(k) 




a(k)




a(k)(cid:19)(cid:27).

(3.26)

consequently, any -product of as or as can be rewritten as usual product of func-

tions and the wigner functional (3.24) is given by (compare with ref. 33)



w (...k...k...k(n)...)

[a, a]

 . . . a(k) . . . a(k) . . . a(k(n)) . . . w 0 [a, a] . . . a(k(n)) . . . a(k) . . . a(k) . . .

. (3.27)

an interesting question arises if we are able to dene the normal ordering within

deformation quantization formalism for eld theory.

indeed it can be easily done by a

suitable generalization of the results by agarwal and wolf35 (see also ref. 26). let
f [q, p ] be a functional over z. dene the functional fn [q, p ] as follows

where

fn [q, p ] := n f [q, p ],

n := exp(cid:26) 

h

4 z dk(cid:18)(k)

p 2(k)

(k)

q2(k)(cid:19)(cid:27) = exp(cid:26) 

1

2z dk

2

a(k)a(k)(cid:27).

(3.28)

this formula was rst obtained by dito7.

then the weyl image of fn [q, p ] gives the normal ordering of the weyl image of

f [q, p ]

: w [f [q, p ]] :

df
= w [fn [q, p ]]

df
= wn (f [q, p ])

(3.29)

it is worthwhile to note some interesting property of normal ordering

n (cid:18) : (: f1 :)(: f2 :) :(cid:19) = w 1(cid:18)(: f1 :)(: f2 :)(cid:19) =(cid:18) n w 1( f1)(cid:19) (cid:18) n w 1( f2)(cid:19).

example: the hamiltonian

from (3.2) and (3.4) we have

then

hn [a, a] =z dkh(k)a(k)a(k) 

1

2z dkh(k)(0),

and by the quantum version of eq. (3.6) we get

where (0) means here the dirac delta in three dimensions.

the eigenvalue schrodinger equation reads

hn  w = ew .

one immediately nds that the vacuum energy is zero i.e.,

as it should be.

hn  w 0 = 0

(3.34)

(3.35)

3.5. time evolution

finally we consider the time evolution of wigner functional. the von neumann-

liouville equation reads

w [a, a; t]

t

= { n h[a, a], w [a, a; t]}m,

where {, }m stands for the moyal bracket

{f1, f2}m =

1

ih(cid:0)f1  f2  f2  f1(cid:1) = f1

2
h

sin(cid:0) h

2



p (cid:1)f2.

(3.36)

(3.37)

for the hamiltonian given by (3.31), the moyal bracket in (3.36) reduces to the poisson

bracket. so we have

w [a, a; t]

t

= { n h[a, a], w [a, a; t]}.

(3.38)

this result within the (, )-formalism has been found previously by curtright and

zachos12.

4. free electromagnetic field

in this section we consider deformation quantization for free electromagnetic eld.

this case seems to be very interesting as it is the simplest example of a eld theory with

constraints. (for details see refs. 27-31).

we choose the temporal gauge where the fourth (temporal) component of the gauge

potential a4 = 0. the canonical components are the potential a = (a1, a2, a3) and its
conjugate momentum  = a = e = (e1, e2, e3) with e being the electric eld2731.

fields a and e satisfy usual relations

{ai(x, t), ej(y, t)} = ij (x  y),

15

{ai(x, t), aj(y, t)} = 0 = {ei(x, t), ej(y, t)},

i, j = 1, 2, 3.

(4.1)

the standard expansion of the eld variables at t = 0 reads

aj(x) =

1

(2)3/2 z dk(cid:18) h

ej(x) =

1

(2)3/2 z dk i(cid:18) h(k)

2(k)(cid:19)1/2(cid:18)aj(k)exp(cid:0)ikx(cid:1) + a
2 (cid:19)1/2(cid:18)aj(k)exp(cid:0)ikx(cid:1)  a

j (k)exp(cid:0)  ikx(cid:1)(cid:19),
j (k)exp(cid:0)  ikx(cid:1)(cid:19),

(4.2)

where (k) = |k|.

from eq. (4.2) one gets

aj(k) =

(2)3/2(2h(k))1/2 z dx exp(cid:8)  ikx(cid:9)(cid:18)(k)aj(x)  iej(x)(cid:19).

1

(4.3)

then by eqs. (4.1) and (4.2) we have

{ai(k), a

j (k)} = 

i
h

ij(k  k),

{ai(k), aj(k)} = 0 = {a

i (k), a

j (k)}.

(4.4)

similarly as in the previous section one can introduce new coordinates q and their

conjugate p momenta31,32

h

qj(k) :=(cid:0)
pj(k) := i(cid:0) h(k)

2(k)(cid:1)1/2(cid:18)a
(cid:1)1/2(cid:18)a

2

j (k) + aj(k)(cid:19),
j (k)  aj(k)(cid:19),

{qi(k), pj(k)} = ij (k  k),

{qi(k), qj(k)} = 0 = {pi(k), pj(k)}.

(4.5)

16

comparing (4.1) with (4.5) we can observe that the transformation between coor-

diantes (a,e) and (q, p ) is a canonical one.

then one gets

qj(k) =

(2)3/2(k)z dx(cid:18)(k)aj(x)cos(kx)  ej(x)sin(kx)(cid:19),

1

pj(k) = 

1

(2)3/2 z dx(cid:18)(k)aj(x)sin(kx) + ej(x)cos(kx)(cid:19)

(4.6)

and

aj(x) =

ej(x) = 

1

1

sin(kx)(cid:19),
(2)3/2 z dk (cid:18)qj(k)cos(kx) 
(2)3/2 z dk(cid:18)(k)qj(k)sin(kx) + pj(k)cos(kx)(cid:19).

pj(k)
(k)

(4.7)

in the standard way we can now split the eld objects into their transverse (t ) and

longitudinal (l) components. to this end we write aj in the following form

aj(k) = hjl(k)al(k) +

kjkl

|k|2 al(k),

(4.8)

where hjl(k) is the projector on the space perpendicular to k i.e., hjl = jl  kj kl
ducing two polarization vectors e1(k) and e2(k) such that

|k|2 . intro-

i (k)e

i (k) =  ,

kie

i (k) = 0, ,  = 1, 2

(4.9)

one can write

e
i (k)at (k) := hij (k)aj(k)  at (k) = e

j (k)aj(k)

dening also al(k) := kj

|k| aj(k) we have

one quickly shows that

ai(k) = e

i (k)at (k) +

al(k).

 (k  k),

{al(k), a

l(k)} = 

i
h

(k  k),

(4.12)

with all the remaining poisson brackets being zero. substituting (4.11) and (4.12) into

(4.5) we obtain the expressions for the t and l-components of q and p . then inserting

(4.11) into (4.2) one gets

1

(2)3/2 z dk (cid:18) h

t (k)exp(cid:0)  ikx(cid:1)(cid:19)

aj(x) =

j (k)[at (k)exp(cid:0)ikx(cid:1)  a
l(k)(cid:19)exp(cid:0)ikx(cid:1)(cid:27).

t (k)exp(cid:0)  ikx(cid:1)(cid:19)

(4.13)

then the hamiltonian of the electromagnetic eld reads

h =

1

2z dx(cid:18)e2(x) + (  a(x))2(cid:19)

=z dkh(k)a

t (k)at (k) +

1

4z dkh(k)(al(k) + a

t (k)(cid:1)+

1

8z dk(cid:0)(pl(k)pl(k))2 +2(k)(ql(k) +ql(k))2(cid:1).

(4.14)

given h we can solve the hamiltonian equations for qj(k, t) and pj(k, t). simple

calculations show that for the transversal part we obtain

18

qt (k, t) = qt (k) cos((k)t) +

pt (k)

(k)

sin((k)t),

pt (k, t) = (k)qt (k) sin((k)t) + pt (k) cos((k)t).

(4.15)

while the solutions for the longitudinal part are

ql(k, t) = ql(k) +

pl(k, t) = pl(k) 

1
2

1

2(cid:18)pl(k)  pl(k)(cid:19)t
2(k)(cid:18)ql(k) + ql(k)(cid:19)t.

(4.16)

consequently time evolution of aj and ej is given by

aj(x, t) =

1

(2)3/2 z dk (cid:26)(cid:18)qt (k, t) cos(kx) 

pt (k, t)

(k)

+

kj

(k)(cid:18)(cid:0)ql(k) + pl(k)t(cid:1) cos(kx) +(cid:0)(k)ql(k)t 

j (k)

sin(kx)(cid:19)e
(k) (cid:1) sin(kx)(cid:19)(cid:27)

pl(k)

ej(x, t) = taj(x, t) = 

1

(2)3/2 z dk(cid:26)(k)qt (k, t) sin(kx)+pt (k, t) cos(kx)(cid:19)e

j (k)

1

(2)3/2 z dk



kj

(k)(cid:18)pl(k) cos(kx) + (k)ql(k) sin(kx)(cid:27).

now the constraint (the gauss equation)

is equivalent to the following constraint

jej(x) = 0,

(4.17)

(4.18)

al(k) + a

l(k) = 0  ql(k) + ql(k) + i(cid:0) pl(k)  pl(k)

(k)

(cid:1) = 0,

(4.19)

19

which is equivalent to the conditions

ql(k) + ql(k) = 0,

pl(k)  pl(k) = 0.

(4.20)

note that the gauge transformation aj(x, t)  aj(x, t) + j(x) produces the ad-

ditional longitudinal term in aj of the form r dkkji(cid:18)b(k) + b(k)(cid:19)exp{ikx} which of

course doesnt change ej(x, t),   a(x, t), h, etc.

4.1. the stratonovich-weyl quantizer for the electromagnetic field

consider now the weyl quantization of electromagnetic eld. to this end we deal

with the elds at the moment t = 0. from the previous section one can conclude that

it is very useful to employ (p, q) or a-formalisms. let f = f [q, p ] be a functional on
electromagnetic eld phase space ze. then according to the weyl rule we assigne to the
functional f the following operator f

f = w (f [q, p ]) :=z dqd(

p
2h

)f [q, p ] [q, p ]

(4.21)

with the stratonovich-weyl quantizer dened similarly as before

[q, p ] =z d(

h
2

)dexp(cid:26)  iz dk(cid:18)(k)q(k) + (k)p (k)(cid:19)(cid:27)

exp(cid:26)iz dk(cid:18)(k) q(k) + (k) p (k)(cid:19)(cid:27),

(4.22)

where (k)q(k) := t (k)qt (k)+l(k)ql(k), etc. and all measures used in the integrals
contain the longitudinal (dql) and the transverse (dqt ) components and q(k) and p (k)
are eld operators

q(k)|qi = q(k)|qi,

p (k)|pi = p (k)|pi,

q(k) =(cid:0) qt (k), ql(k)(cid:1), p (k) =(cid:0) pt (k), pl(k)(cid:1), |qi = |qti|qli, |pi = |pti |pli,

20

z dq|qihq| = 1 and z d(

p
2h

)|pihp| = 1.

(4.23)

the commutation relations for q and p operators read

[ qt (k), pt (k)] = ih (k  k),

[ ql(k), pl(k)] = ih(k  k)

(4.24)

and all remaining commutators are zero.

then by (4.5) the relation between q and p operators and the annihilation and

creation operators a and a



is

h

qt,l(k) :=(cid:0)
pt,l(k) := i(cid:0) h(k)

2(k)(cid:1)1/2(cid:18)a
(cid:1)1/2(cid:18)a

2



t,l(k) + at,l(k)(cid:19),
t,l(k)  at,l(k)(cid:19).



(4.25)

we have the usual commutation relations

[at (k), a



t (k)] =  (k  k),

[al(k), a



l(k)] = (k  k)

(4.26)

with all remaining commutators being zero.

the stratonovich-weyl quantizer (4.22) can be rewritten as before in the form of

(3.14) and it has the standard properties analogous to (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12).

4.2. the star product

from (4.21) we get

f [q, p ] = w 1( f ) = t r(cid:26) [q, p ] f(cid:27).

(4.27)

the moyal -product in the case of electromagnetic eld theory can be dened in a
similar way as for the scalar eld. let f1[q, p ] and f2[q, p ] the functionals on ze and
let f1 and f2 be their corresponding operators. then the analogous calculations as in sec.

2 lead to the result

21

(cid:0)f1  f2(cid:1)[q, p ] = f1[q, p ]exp(cid:18) ih

(4.28)

4.3. the wigner functional for the electromagnetic field

now we are in a position to consider the quantum version of the gauss law (4.18).
it is well known (see for example ref. 29) that the operator equation j ej(x) = 0 is

inconsistent with commutation relations (4.1) or (4.4). to avoid this inconsistency one

imposes the weaker constraint on the physical states

j ej(x)|physi = 0.

(cid:18)al(k) + a



l(k)(cid:19)|physi = 0

which is equivalent to

or in terms of ql and pl

(4.29)

(4.30)

(cid:18) ql(k) + ql(k)(cid:19)|physi = 0 and (cid:18) pl(k)  pl(k)(cid:19)|physi = 0.

(4.31)

the wigner functional in the case of electromagnetic eld is dened similarly as for

the scalar eld. let phys be the density operator of a physical quantum state of the

electromagnetic eld. then the wigner functional corresponding to this state is given by

22

w [q, p ] =z d(



2h

)exp(cid:26)

i

hz dk(k)p (k)(cid:27)hq+


2|phys|q



2i  t r(cid:26) [q, p ]phys(cid:27).

(4.32)

when phys = |physihphys| then eq. (4.32) gives
w [q, p ] =z d(

hz dk(k)p (k)(cid:27)phys[q 

)exp(cid:26) 

2h



i


2

]phys[q +


2

].

(4.33)

in deformation quantization formalism eqs. (4.30) or (4.31) read

(cid:18)al(k) + a

l(k)(cid:19)  w [a, a] = 0

(4.34)

or

(cid:18)ql(k) + ql(k)(cid:19)  w [q, p ] = 0 and (cid:18)pl(k)  pl(k)(cid:19)  w [q, p ] = 0,

(4.35)

respectively. using (4.28) one gets

(cid:26)ql(k) + ql(k) +
(cid:26)pl(k)  pl(k) 

ih

2 (cid:18) 
2 (cid:18)



ih

ql(k) 

+

pl(k)



pl(k)(cid:19)(cid:27)w [q, p ] = 0,
ql(k)(cid:19)(cid:27)w [q, p ] = 0.



employing the fact that the wigner functional is real we obtain four equations

(cid:18)ql(k) + ql(k)(cid:19)w [q, p ] = 0, (cid:18)pl(k)  pl(k)(cid:19)w [q, p ] = 0
pl(k)(cid:19)w [q, p ] = 0.

ql(k)(cid:19)w [q, p ] = 0, (cid:18) 

pl(k)

+







ql(k) 

(cid:18)

the general solution of these equations is given by

(4.36)

(4.37)

w [q, p ] = t

w [qt , pt ][ql(k) + ql(k)][pl(k)  pl(k)].

(4.38)

comparing this result with the formula for classical constraints (4.20) one observs that the
wigner functional w vanishes on the points of phase space ze which dont satisfy these
constraints. (compare with ref. 10).

23

example: the ground state

the wigner functional w 0 of the ground state is dened by

(cid:18)al(k) + a

l(k)(cid:19)  w 0 = 0

at (k)  w 0 = 0.

by eq. (4.38) we are led to the equation

at (k)  t

w 0 = 0.

employing (4.28) we have

at t

w 0 +

1
2

thus the ground state is given by

t
a

w 0

t (k)

= 0.

w 0 = cexp(cid:18)  2z dk a

t (k)at (k)(cid:19), c > 0.

t

hence the wigner functional (4.38) for the ground state reads

(4.39)

(4.40)

(4.41)

(4.42)

w 0 [q, p ] = cexp(cid:26)

1

hz

dk

(k)(cid:18)p 2

t (k)+2(k)q2

t (k)(cid:19)(cid:27)[ql(k)+ql(k)][pl(k)pl(k)].

(4.43)

similarly as in the case of scalar eld we can nd the wigner functional for any higher

state. to this end one must change in the formula (3.27) a and a by a

t  and at .

let o be a gauge invariant quantum observable and let phys be the density operator
of the physical state. the action of o on phys is equivalent to the action of transversal part
ot of o on phys. let ot [qt , pt ] be the functional corresponding to ot , ot [qt , pt ] =
w 1(cid:0) ot(cid:1). then for the expected value h oi one gets
t r{ o phys}
t r{phys}
24

h oi =

= r dqtd( pt

2h )ot [qt , pt ]t

w [qt , pt ]

2h )t

w [qt , pt ]

r dqtd( pt

.

(4.44)

4.4. ordering

finally we can also dene the normal ordering of eld operators within deformation
quantization formalism. it can be done, as before, with the use of the operator nt acting
in the phase space ze

nt := exp(cid:26) 

h

4 z dk(cid:18)(k)
2z dk

(4.45)

let o[q, p ] be any gauge invariant functional on ze and o its weyl image o =

w(cid:0)o[p, q](cid:1). then, as before

df

= w(cid:18) nto[q, p ](cid:19).

: o :

(4.46)

having done all that one can easily formulate the deformation quantization of electro-
magnetic eld in the coulomb gauge: a4 = 0 and jaj = 0. here29 {ai(x, t), ej(y, t)} =
ij t (xy), where t stands for the transversal -function. consequently, from the very
begining a = (a1, a2, a3) and e = (e1, e2, e3) are no longer independent canonical
variables. however, qt  and pt  are such variables. moreover, the constraint jej(x) = 0

is automatically satised. therefore results obtained for the temporal gauge can be quickly

carry over to the coulomb gauge by omitting the longitudinal parts in all formulas of tem-

poral gauge.

5. topological eects (casimir eect) in deformation quantization

in this section we are going to compute the vacuum expectation value of the energy

25

of a real scalar eld on the cylinder and on the mobius strip (twisted scalar eld) within

the deformation quantization formalism.

5.1. scalar field on the cylinder

consider a cylinder s1  r representing a two dimensional space time. here s1 is
the spatial part and r is the temporal part. local coordinates are as usual (x, t). s1
l n with n  z and the frequency is
l2 n2 + m2. the hamiltonian operator can be seen as

has circumference l, then k is quantized as k = 2

given by (k) = k2 + m2 = q 42

the zero-zero component of the energy-momentum tensor

t00 =

1

2(cid:18)(t )2 + (x )2 + m2 2(cid:19).

(5.1)

now we would like to compute the vacuum expectation value h t00i(l). in order to

do this computation we will use the point splitting method35,36 and we write

h t00i(l) = lim

tt

h0|

1

lim

2(cid:18)tt + xx + m2(cid:19) (x, t) (x, t)|0li

xx(cid:26)h0l|
2(cid:18)tt + xx + m2(cid:19) (x, t) (x, t)|0i(cid:27),

1

(5.2)

where |oli and |oi are the vacuum states for the two dimensional cylindrical and
minkowski space times, respectively.

from the fact that the second term of the right-hand side of the above equation is

independent of l we can rewrite it as follows

lim

h t00i(l) :=z dl lim
where the integration constant is dened by the condition h t00i() = 0.

2(cid:18)tt + xx + m2(cid:19) 

xx(cid:26) 1

lh0l| (x, t) (x, t)|0li(cid:27) (5.3)

thus to compute of h t00i(l) it is necessary rst to compute the quantity h0l| (x, t)

tt

(x, t)|0li. in terms of deformation quantization we have (compare with (4.44))

h0l| (x, t) (x, t)|0li = r dqd( p

5.3. new normal ordering

we end this section with some comments which will be developed in further work.

the results obtained suggest that it seems to be reasonable (and perhaps necessary) to
deal with new normal ordering n  when spaces of non-trivial topology are considered. in
the present case n  should satisfy the following condition
2h )( n h)l

(5.27)

w0[q, p ]
[q, p ]

h h i(l) = r dqd( p
r dqd( p

2h )l

wo

where h h i(l) is the vacuum energy. the simplest and natural assumption is (see (3.28))

n  = exp(cid:18)xk (cid:0) 

1
2

+ (k)(cid:1)

2

a(k)a(k)(cid:19).

(5.28)

inserting (5.28) into (5.27), employing the formulas (3.31) and (3.35) one gets the

condition on (k)

hxk

(k)(k) = h h i(l).

30

(5.29)

thus, for example, in the case of the massless scalar eld on cylindrical space time we

have (see (5.16))

xn6=0

|n|(

2n
l

) = 

1
12

.

(5.30)

of course, there is innite number of solutions to (5.29) or (5.30).

given n  one can dene new star product  which is cohomologically equivalent to

the moyal -product

f1  f2 = n 1(cid:18) n f1  n f2(cid:19).
the star product  gives a new quantization of classical eld.

consider now 4-eld theory on the cylindrical space time. we have

h =

1

2z dx[()2 + (x)2 + m22 + 4].

to fulll condition (5.27) in rst order of perturbation theory we take now

n  = exp(cid:26)xk

(cid:18)(cid:0) 

1
2

+ (k)(cid:1)

2

a(k)a(k)

+ (k)

a2(k)a2(k)(cid:19)(cid:27).

4

(5.31)

(5.32)

(5.33)

straightforward calculations show that the condition (5.27) leads to the following

relations

xk

(k)
(k)

= 0, xk

(k)
2(k)

= 0

hxk

(k)(k) +

3h2

4l xk

(k)
2(k)

= h h i(l),

(5.34)

where k = 2n

l and (k) = q( 2n

l )2 + m2 with n  z. (h h i(l) for 4-eld theory has

been found by kay37).

31

further developing of non-linear eld theory in terms of deformation quantization

formalism is a very dicult problem as in that case we must look for other cohomologi-

cally equivalent star products to avoid divergences (dito8). we are going to consider this

question in a separate paper.

6. final remarks

in this paper we have generalized some aspects of deformation quantization to non-

interacting eld theory. we were able to show that many well known results of deformation

quantization in quantum mechanics could be extended to the case of quantum eld theory.

this was possible because a free eld can be represented as an innite number of indepen-

dent harmonic oscillators. one can apply the usual deformation quantization formalism to

each oscillator to obtain deformation quantization of the whole theory. consequently it is

expected that phase space interpretation of quantum eld theory can be also extended to

perturbative eld theory. some work in this direction has been done by dito8, but many

problems remain to be investigated. for example the deformation quantization of -model

and chern-simons gauge theory, which have non-trivial phase spaces. interesting is if fe-

dosovs approach4 can be applied in the later cases. we intend to devote a forthcoming

work to these questions.
