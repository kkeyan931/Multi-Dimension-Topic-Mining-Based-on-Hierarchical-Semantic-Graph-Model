abstract

it is shown that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in certain three-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theories, by using the s-rule in their string theory realization as
brane congurations.
in particular, supersymmetry is broken in n = 3 supersymmetric
yang-mills-chern-simons theory with gauge group su (n) and cs coecient k, as well as
in its n = 2 and n = 1 deformations, when n > |k|. in addition, supersymmetry is broken
in the n = 1 mass deformation of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with gauge
group su (n) and one matter multiplet when n > 1.
in the latter case the breaking is
induced by an instanton-generated repulsive potential.

1 introduction

much has been learned about gauge theories in various dimensions and with various amounts
of supersymmetry from the study of brane congurations in type ii string theories. examples
which stand out are mirror symmetry in three-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
(ym) theory [1], and seiberg duality in four-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric ym theory with
matter [2], but there are many more [3]. the former follows rather trivially from s-duality in type
iib string theory, by considering a conguration of parallel d3-branes suspended between two
parallel ns5-branes. the low-energy eective eld theory on the world-volume of the d3-branes
is then given by three-dimensional n = 4 sym theory.

it is well known that three-dimensional gauge theories can include, in addition to the usual
ym term, a chern-simons (cs) term in the action. the latter gives a gauge-invariant mass
to the vector eld proportional to the cs coecient k. in the (non-compact) abelian case k is
arbitrary, but for non-abelian gauge groups invariance of the classical theory under large gauge
transformations requires k to be an integer [4]. like the pure ym theory, the combined ym-
cs theory can be extended to include various amounts of supersymmetry, by including massive
spinor and scalar elds transforming in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. unlike
the pure ym case however, for which one can have as many as sixteen supersymmetries, i.e.
n = 8, the largest amount of supersymmetry allowed in the ym-cs theory is n = 3, i.e.
six supersymmetries [5]. type iib brane congurations for a class of supersymmetric ym-cs
theories which includes the n = 3 theory have been constructed in [6]. these congurations have
been used to study various non-perturbative aspects of sym-cs theories, such as the structure
of the moduli space [7], the spectrum of solitons [8], and s-duality [9]. an interesting question
is whether, and under what conditions, supersymmetry is dynamically broken in such theories.
in [6] kitao, ohta and ohta noted that for small enough k some of the above congurations are
not supersymmetric.

recently witten has argued that for n = 1 supersymmetric ym-cs theory with gauge group
su(n) and cs coecient k supersymmetry is spontaneously broken when |k| < n/2 [10]. this
argument is based on a computation of the supersymmetric index tr(1)f , which vanishes in
the above regime. for large |k| one can integrate out the fermions to obtain a local eective eld
theory, and at low energy one can ignore the ym term. the resulting theory is pure cs with a
shifted coecient, given by1

k = k 

sgn(mf ) ,

(1)

n
2

where mf is the coecient of the fermion mass term in the action. pure cs theory with gauge
group g and coecient k is in turn related to the wzw model of g at level k. the correspon-
dence implies in particular that the number of zero-energy states in the cs theory is equal to

1note that for n > 1 and odd this implies that k must be quantized in half-odd-integer rather than integer

units. this is known as the parity anomaly [11, 12].

2

the number of conformal blocks of the wzw model, and that these states are all bosonic (or all
fermionic). the index can therefore be computed by counting the number of conformal blocks,
which for the above case gives

i(k) =

1

(n  1)!

n/21yj=n/2+1

(k  j) .

(2)

in the regime where this computation is reliable, namely large |k|, the index is non-vanishing
and supersymmetry is unbroken. note however that for |k| < n/2 the above expression vanishes,
which suggests that supersymmetry may be spontaneously broken in this regime. of-course, the
approximation used to derive (2) is not reliable in this regime, and one must consider the full
microscopic theory.

the microscopic problem can be studied by compactifying on a torus t2, whose volume is
suciently small, so that one can ignore the massive kaluza-klein modes [10]. the index can
then be computed by quantizing the space of classical zero energy congurations.2 for the gauge
eld this is the space of at connections on t2, which for su(n) is given by a copy of cpn1.
there are also fermionic zero-modes with values in some bundle over cpn1. quantization gives
rise to a hilbert space of supersymmetric states, which is given by the cohomology of the bundle
over cpn1. the result is an index given by

i(k) =

nxi=0

(1)i dim h i(cpn1, lkn/2) ,

(3)

where l is the basic line bundle over cpn1. remarkably, this reduces to precisely the low-
energy expression for the index (2). more importantly, since all the cohomology groups are
trivial for |k| < n/2, there are no zero energy states at all in this regime. thus supersymmetry is
spontaneously broken for |k| < n/2, at least for a suciently small torus. this suggests that the
same is true in the innite volume limit, however a direct argument for this is not yet available.
a natural direction in which one might try to extend wittens result is to consider more
supersymmetry, i.e. n = 2 and n = 3. in either case one introduces scalar elds, as well as
additional fermions, into the theory. since the mass of these scalars is g2k, they contribute to the
space of classical zero-energy congurations, and thereby make the microscopic computation of
the index much more involved than above. at large |k| one can still use the low energy eective
theory obtained by integrating out the fermions (and scalars), and the resulting index is given
by

i(k) =

1

(n  1)!

n1yj=1

(k  j) ,

(4)

2this includes all states with energies of order g2k or less.

for both the n = 2 and n = 3 theories. this diers from the n = 1 result (2) due the presence
of additional fermions. one might however guess that, as in the n = 1 theory, the large |k| result
would hold for all |k|, and therefore that supersymmetry would be spontaneously broken in the
n = 2 and n = 3 theories (on t2) for |k| < n.

it is the purpose of this paper to establish that supersymmetry is indeed broken in the
above regime for the n = 3 theory, and for certain n = 2 and n = 1 deformations thereof.
our approach will be to make use of recently proposed type iib brane congurations for these
theories, and show that these congurations break supersymmetry in the above regime. the
relevant congurations were constructed in [6], and consist of d3-branes suspended between an
ns5-brane and a (p, q) 5-brane. in section 2 we will review the argument presented in [6], which
shows that the (p, q) 5-brane gives rise to a cs term with coecient k = p/q in the low energy
eld theory of the suspended d3-branes. note that for multiple d3-branes and |q| > 1 this result
is in conict with the requirement that k be quantized in the non-abelian case. we will partially
resolve this conict by providing an alternative derivation of the above result, which is valid only
for |q| = 1. specically, the action contains additional terms when |q| > 1.

the above congurations can be thought of as deformations of the conguration studied
in [1], which consisted of d3-branes suspended between two parallel ns5-branes. the latter
corresponds to d = 3 n = 4 sym theory. by rotating the second 5-brane in both the spatial
directions and the eleventh m direction we produce a rotated (p, q) 5-brane, and break some
of the supersymmetries. depending on the relative orientation of the two 5-branes, one obtains
n = 3 sym-cs theory, or n = 2 and n = 1 deformations of this theory, which include one and
three matter multiplets, respectively. note that the pure n = 1 theory cannot be obtained by
this construction.

we review the supersymmetric brane congurations and the corresponding gauge theories in
section 3. we then show that when the number of suspended d3-branes n exceeds a certain
bound supersymmetry is in fact broken. in most cases, and in particular for the n = 3 theory,
this is a consequence of the so-called s-rule [1], which we review in section 3 as well. in these
cases we nd that supersymmetry is broken when |k| < n, precisely as predicted by the low
energy computation of the index.

in one special case, namely the n = 1 deformation with k = 0, supersymmetry is broken
when n > 1. this can be understood as arising from an instanton in the brane conguration,
which gives rise to a repulsive potential between the d3-branes. the n = 1 theory can be
thought of as a mass deformation of an n = 2 sym theory, in which the instanton gives rise
to a superpotential. the mass deformation then results in a potential with a non-vanishing
minimum. this implies that three-dimensional n = 1 sym theory with gauge group su(n) and
three avors breaks supersymmetry when n > 1. the same can clearly not happen in the k = 0
theories with higher supersymmetry (n = 2, 4), as these correspond to dimensional reductions of
four-dimensional supersymmetric (n = 1, 2) ym theories, in which supersymmetry is not broken.
since the n = 1 theory cannot be obtained by dimensional reduction from a supersymmetric

4

theory in four dimensions, there is no contradiction.

2 cs terms and (p,q) 5-branes

we begin with the type iib brane conguration studied in [1], namely two parallel ns5-branes
stretched along (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) and separated along x6, as well as n d3-branes stretched be-
tween them along (x1, x2, x6). in the low energy limit, where one can ignore modes along the
compact direction x6, this gives a three-dimensional n = 4 sym theory with gauge group u(n).
the n = 4 vector multiplet consists of the vector eld, four majorana fermions, and three real
scalar elds, all transforming in the adjoint representation of u(n). the three scalar elds cor-
respond to the positions of the d3-branes in x3, x4, and x5. theories with less supersymmetry
can be obtained by rotating one of the ns5-branes in the (x3, x7), (x4, x8), or (x5, x9) plane.
in the eld theory on the d3-branes this translates into mass terms for the three scalar elds
proportional to the tangents of the three rotation angles.

since in three dimensions the vector eld is dual to a scalar eld, it would be natural to
associate a similar mass term to the vector eld. this is realized most naturally by lifting
the above congurations to m theory. recall that type iib string theory corresponds to the
compactication of m theory on a vanishingly small torus. let us assume that the two compact

between them along (x1, x6). rotating one of the m5-branes in the (x3, x7), (x4, x8), and (x5, x9)
planes then reduces to the above rotated ns5-brane congurations. on the other hand, the

coordinates of the torus are bx2, x10. from the point of view of m theory, the original conguration
then corresponds to two parallel m5-branes along (x1,bx2, x3, x4, x5), and n m2-branes stretched
m5-brane can also be rotated in the (bx2, x10) plane. this will change the ns5-brane into a (p, q)

5-brane, with p/q given by the tangent of the rotation angle. since, from the m theory point of
view, the four angles are on an equal footing, it is natural to guess that the angle of rotation in
the internal torus will give mass to the fourth boson, namely the scalar eld dual to the vector
eld of the n = 4 vector multiplet. this mass will again be proportional to the tangent of the
angle, namely p/q. the only way to do this without breaking the gauge symmetry in the low
energy eld theory is to add a cs term with coecient k = p/q to the lagrangian. it is the
purpose of this section to derive this result.

2.1 original derivation

the content of the three-dimensional eective eld theory on a d3-brane suspended between
5-branes depends crucially on the boundary conditions. for an ns5-brane, the appropriate
boundary condition is

ns5 : f6 = a6  6a = 0

( = 0, 1, 2) ,

(5)

5

whereas for a d5-brane it is

d5 : f = a  a = 0

(,  = 0, 1, 2) .

(6)

these conditions remove some of the degrees of freedom of the four-dimensional gauge eld. in
particular, the former removes the scalar component in the dimensional reduction on x6 (and
therefore the d = 3, n = 4 hypermultiplet), and the latter removes the vector component (and
therefore the d = 3, n = 4 vector multiplet). the boundary condition corresponding to a (p, q)
5-brane is obtained by applying the appropriate sl(2, z) transformation, which gives

(p, q) 5 :

a6  6a  a

p
q

a = 0 ,

(7)

where a is an arbitrary constant at this stage. this boundary condition introduces an unwanted
surface term to the variation of the action with respect to a. to cancel this term one needs
to add a boundary term. it was argued in [6] that this boundary term in the four-dimensional
theory on the interval reduces to the cs action in the three-dimensional eective eld theory

(8)

the constant a was then determined to be g2
4/4 by comparing with a more heuristic derivation
using the axion background of the (p, q) 5-brane. the coecient of the cs term is therefore
given by k = p/q.

a naive generalization to n d3-branes would suggest a non-abelian cs term with coecient
k = p/q. however, while fractional cs coecients are perfectly sensible in the abelian case (and
in fact give interesting predictions about a k  1/k mirror symmetry, in accord with eld theory
expectations [13, 7, 8]), it is well known that invariance under large gauge transformations (in
r3) requires k to be an integer in the non-abelian case [4]. for |q| = 1 the coecient is an
integer, and the cs term is gauge invariant. it is not clear however where the above derivation
fails if |q| > 1.

in order to gain insight into this issue, we shall oer an alternative derivation of the cs
term, which reproduces the above result for |q| = 1, and clearly demonstrates the complications
associated with |q| > 1.

2.2 alternative derivation

our strategy will be to identify the (p, q) 5-brane as a particular mass deformation of an abelian
three-dimensional gauge theory, and then show that this mass deformation induces the desired
cs term. this will follow from the basic fact that integration of massive fermions in three
dimensions yields an eective cs term which arises in a one loop computation [12, 5]. a cs

6

term is generated for each pair of u(1) groups present in the problem, whether they be local or
global. in either case one will get an interesting eect. the contribution to a given cs term is
proportional to the sign of the mass of the fermion and to the charges of the fermion under the
two u(1) groups in question. for a fermion of mass mf and charges qi the contributions to the
cs terms are therefore of the form

qiqjsgn(mf ).

(9)

the theory we shall consider is three-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric u(1) maxwell
theory with one avor of matter. this theory corresponds to the dimensional reduction of four-
dimensional n = 1 maxwell theory with one avor. the massless vector multiplet consists of
a vector eld, two majorana fermions and a scalar eld. the matter consists of two oppositely
charged chiral multiplets q, q (electron and positron), each containing a two-component ma-
jorana fermion and a complex scalar. this theory can be realized on a single d3-brane suspended
between an ns5-brane along (x1, x2, x3, x4, x5) and another (ns5) along (x1, x2, x3, x8, x9) [2].
the matter multiplet is provided by a d5-brane along (x1, x2, x7, x8, x9) (see fig.1).

there are two possible mass terms for matter in three dimensions [14]. the rst is inher-
ited from the four-dimensional n = 1 theory, and corresponds to the standard complex mass
parameter obtained from the superpotential,

z d2mc qq .

(10)

in the brane picture this corresponds to the position of the d5-brane in the (x4, x5) plane. the
second is a real mass term of the form

z d4qem q ,

z d4 qe m  q ,

(11)

which can be chosen independently for the two chiral multiplets. we dene the axial and vector
masses respectively as

ma =

(m + m) , mv =

(m  m) .

(12)

1
2

1
2

since the minimal coupling of the charged matter elds to the vector multiplet takes the standard
form

z d4qev q ,

z d4 qev q ,

(13)

we see that the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the scalar in the n = 2 vector multiplet
gives a real mass of equal magnitude and opposite sign to the two chiral multiplets. by shifting
this scalar eld we can therefore set mv = 0. the total mass terms for the electron and positron
would then be given by ( + ma)|q|2 and ( + ma)|q|2, respectively.

in the brane picture the vev of the scalar  corresponds to the x3 position of the d3-
brane, whereas the real mass parameter mv corresponds to the x3 position of the d5-brane. at

7

this point the attentive reader will wonder how the axial mass ma comes about. in the brane
picture we must somehow break the d5-brane into two independent pieces, whose positions in
x3 will correspond to the mass parameters of the two fermions. following [15], this is done by
moving the d5-brane along the compact direction x6 until it coincides with the ns5-brane, at
which point it can break along x3 into two d5-branes which end on the ns5-brane. the two
fermions (chiral multiplets) then correspond to strings between the d3-brane and the two pieces
of d5-brane. in order to preserve supersymmetry, the 5-brane system has to form a (p, q) web
in the (x3, x7) plane consisting of the two pieces of d5-brane, two pieces of ns5-brane, and an
intermediate (1, 1) 5-brane, where the sign depends on which way the d5-brane breaks [16].
turning on an axial mass corresponds to moving the two d5-brane pieces an equal amount, but
in opposite directions, along x3 (see fig.1), and the sign of the mass is correlated with the sign
in the intermediate 5-brane.

as there are two u(1) groups in the problem, namely the gauge group and the global axial
symmetry, integrating out the fermions produces two relevant cs terms. the rst is the usual
cs term for the gauge eld with coecient

and the second is a mutual cs term for the two u(1)s with coecient

sgn(ma + )

sgn(ma  ) .

(14)

(15)

the latter corresponds to an fi term in the action.

as we vary  the d3-brane moves along x3. for  > ma and  < ma the d3-brane ends
on the ordinary ns5-brane, which is displaced by ma along x7. the mass terms have opposite
signs, so the cs coecient (14) vanishes. on the other hand there is a non-trivial fi term (15),
which is consistent with the displacement. for ma <  < ma the d3-brane ends on the (1, 1)
5-brane, and the mass terms have the same sign. the net cs coecient is therefore given by
k = 1. this establishes the result we were after for the case p = q = 1.

2.3 generalizations

the above argument is easily generalized for u(n) by including n d3-branes instead of just one.
one can also generalize to an arbitrary integer cs coecient k = p by including p d5-branes
(and thus nf = p avors). turning on an axial mass for all the avors will correspond in the
brane picture to a web of p d5-branes, 1 ns5-brane, and an intermediate (p, 1) 5-brane. the
contributions of the p avors then simply add up to a cs coecient k = p, as anticipated.

in order to further generalize to fractional cs coecients p/q (|q| > 1), which are supposed to
arise from a (p, q) 5-brane, we need to start with multiple (|q|) coinciding ns5-branes. it turns

out, however, that the corresponding eective eld theories on branes suspended between the
ns5-brane and ns5-branes contain additional matter [2]. for example in four dimensions, i.e.
on d4-branes suspended between an ns5-brane and several ns5-branes in type iia, the ir limit
of the theory is described by sym with nf fundamental avors (from d6-branes) coupled to an
additional chiral multiplet x transforming in the adjoint representation, with a superpotential
of the form

w = x |q|+1 + qx q .

(16)

this is a rather complicated theory. in particular, its seiberg-dual is presumably some kind of
tensionless string theory [17].

in three dimensions we also expect additional massless adjoint elds, although the precise
description of the ir physics is not known. the presence of these elds should give rise to
new interesting eects, such as an enhanced global su(|q|) symmetry from the coinciding ns5-
branes. upon turning on the real mass terms for all the (fundamental) avors as before, the
vector multiplet would again become massive. this time, however, the ir dynamics would be
governed by the remaining massless adjoint multiplet and its self-interactions, rather than by the
cs term. we therefore avoid getting pure cs dynamics with non-integer coecient.

of course in the abelian case the cs coecient can be fractional (and in fact real). it would
be interesting to understand this in the above context, especially since the brane conguration
for a non-integer cs coecient [6], and the corresponding spectrum of vortices [8, 7], predicts the
k  1/k duality of [13]. in the abelian case the adjoint multiplet x is neutral, and couples only
to the charged elds. one might hope that in the ir it decouples altogether, so that the analysis
of [6] makes sense, and we can associate a maxwell-chern-simons theory with this system, where
k = p/q.

as a nal generalization, consider a second type of avor d5-brane (d5), which is stretched
along (x1, x2, x4, x5, x7), in addition to the original type along (x1, x2, x7, x8, x9). this leads

9

generically to quartic superpotentials [16], whose precise form depends on the ordering of the
two types of d5-branes. if all the d5-branes are to the left of all the d5-branes (so that the
former can be moved towards the ns5-brane without crossing the latter, and the latter can be
similarly moved towards the ns5-brane) there is no superpotential. turning on axial masses for
all the avors then corresponds to 5-brane webs in the (x3, x7) plane involving a (p1, 1) 5-brane
at one end and a (p2, 1) 5-brane at the other end. from the eld theory point of view all
p1 + p2 avors are the same, so the result is identical to the one obtained from p1 + p2 d5-branes,
namely a cs coecient k = p1  p2. the signs are somewhat ambiguous at this stage. to x
this ambiguity we use the fact that the conguration of d3-branes between two parallel (1, 1)
5-branes preserves n = 4 supersymmetry, which forbids a cs term. so for a (p1, 1) 5-brane and
a (p2, 1) 5-brane the cs coecient is k = (p1  p2). for multiple ns5-branes at both ends we
therefore get

k = 

.

as before, the low energy theory will contain additional massless elds if q1 > 1 or q2 > 1, which
one would hope decouple in the abelian case.

of course now that one has altered the boundary condition at the other end, the original
hypermultiplet is no longer removed, but in fact obtains a nite mass, which is complementary
to the mass of the vector multiplet, namely

this gives the required massless hypermultiplet if both 5-branes are d5-branes.

3 susy brane congurations and susy breaking

3.1 brane congurations and related eld theories

as we are interested in theories containing only the original three-dimensional n = 4 vector
multiplet, we shall only consider congurations of d3-branes suspended between an ns5-brane
and a (p, q) 5-brane. all possible supersymmetric congurations of this type have been classied
in [6], and are summarized in table 1. the rotation angles, from the m theory point of view, in

the (bx2, x10), (x3, x7), (x4, x8), and (x5, x9) planes are taken to be , , , and , respectively. in

particular,  determines (p, q) as

tan  =

(19)

gsp
q

and the other angles determine the masses of the three scalar elds corresponding to the position
of the d3-brane in (x3, x4, x5). if any of the latter angles vanish, as in congurations 1, 2(i,ii),

10

and 3(ii), the theory contains massless scalars, and the cs term is no longer the dominant part
of the ir dynamics. therefore we are only really interested in the cases in which all scalar elds
are massive, i.e. 3(i) and 4(i,ii,iii).

in particular, 4(iii) corresponds to the maximally supersymmetric n = 3 sym-cs theory
with cs coecient k = p/q. the associated r-symmetry is so(3), and the massive vector
multiplet consists of a spin 1 vector eld a, three spin 1/2 majorana fermions a, one spin -1/2
fermion , and three scalars a.3 the ym and cs lagrangians of this theory are respectively
given by [5]

where ca are auxiliary scalar elds. all the elds have the same mass g2k, but the mass term
for  enters with a sign opposite to that of a. the ym lagrangian by itself actually has n = 4
supersymmetry, with an so(4) r-symmetry, and the vector multiplet is massless.4 the dierent
mass terms for the fermions in the cs lagrangian break the supersymmetry to n = 3, and the
r-symmetry to so(3). the total scalar potential is given by

so all the at directions of the n = 4 theory are lifted.

the congurations 4(ii) and 4(i) are deformations of 4(iii), whereby one changes the spatial
angles , , and  relative to . these correspond therefore to n = 2 and n = 1 deformations
of the n = 3 theory, in which one adds additional mass terms to the elds 1,2, 3 and  in the
n = 2 case, and to 3 and 2 as well in the n = 1 case. conguration 3(i) corresponds to the
special case k = 0, i.e.  = 0, of the n = 1 deformation. in this theory the gauge eld (and
its fermion superpartner 1) is massless, and the three matter multiplets containing the fermions
, 2, and 3, as well as all the scalars, are massive.

3this is a long rather than short (bps) multiplet. since the mass terms come from a cs term rather than

from spontaneous symmetry breaking, the central charge of the superalgebra vanishes.

4the massless three-dimensional n = 4 vector multiplet is given in terms of so(4)  su (2)  su (2) repre-
sentations by (1, 1)  (3, 1)  (2, 2), corresponding to the vector, three scalars, and four fermions, respectively.
this has the same content as the massive n = 3 vector multiplet.

table 1: brane congurations and supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions.

as we have seen in the previous section, the derivation of the cs coecient was only reliable
in the case |q| = 1. we shall therefore restrict ourselves to this case, and thus assume that k = p.

3.2 susy breaking via the s-rule

the amount of supersymmetry listed for each of the above congurations was determined by
intersecting the supersymmetries preserved by each individual brane. this is a reliable procedure
for counting supersymmetries when the branes are all innite in extent. when some of the branes
are suspended between others, on the other hand, supersymmetry can sometimes be broken if the
number of suspended branes exceeds a certain value, even though the analogous conguration of
innite branes is supersymmetric. the rst example of this phenomenon was given in [1], and
involved a conguration of d3-branes suspended between an ns5-brane and a d5-brane, which
had precisely one common transverse direction. this conguration appears to preserve eight
(1/4) supersymmetries. however, it was argued that in order to reproduce known eld theory
results one had to assume that the above conguration breaks supersymmetry if more than one
d3-brane is present. this apparently empirical rule was termed the s-rule.

the s-rule was subsequently derived in string theory for brane congurations which are related
to the above by a series of dualities, and which consist of a dp-brane and a d(8  p)-brane which
are mutually transverse, together with fundamental strings suspended between them [18]. each
open string between the two d-branes has a non-degenerate ground state consisting of a single
fermion. as the d-branes are completely transverse to each other, these fermions are localized
at a point, and are therefore subject to the pauli exclusion principle [18]. hence, only one string
can be in its supersymmetric ground state. the others must be in non-supersymmetric excited

12

states. therefore a conguration with more than one string breaks supersymmetry.

another way to see this is by the string creation phenomenon [19], which occurs in the above
congurations when the d-branes cross each other [20, 21, 22]. assume there are n suspended
strings initially. denoting the 16-component supercharges of type ii string theory by ql and qr,
the (apparent) unbroken supersymmetry of the above conguration is generated by lql +rqr,
where the spinors l and r are solutions of the following equations

l = 1    pr

dp-brane
d(8-p)-brane l = p+1    8r
string

l = 01l , r = 01r ,

(23)

and the sign in the last equation depends on the orientation of the suspended string. there exists
a non-trivial solution only for the upper sign, which means that one orientation preserves (1/4)
supersymmetry, while the other breaks it. let us assume therefore that the n strings are oriented
in the former way, so that the conguration appears to be supersymmetric. as the branes cross
the orientation of the suspended strings is reversed, and a single string is created with the original
(supersymmetric) orientation. the latter annihilates with one of the former, leaving n  1 strings
with the non-supersymmetric orientation. since the nal conguration is not supersymmetric
for n > 1, neither is the initial one. one can then use combinations of t-duality and s-duality to
relate the dp-d(8  p)-string system to various other systems, including the ns5-d5-d3 system,
and thereby establish the above supersymmetric bound on the number of suspended branes for
these systems as well.

it is clear that the s-rule is intimately connected to the brane creation phenomenon. this is in
fact true also for the original setting of d3-branes between ns5-branes and d5-branes of [1]. this
connection allows us in turn to generalize the s-rule to brane congurations in which multiple
suspended branes are created, and which are not related by dualities to any of the above cong-
urations. for example, the system of a (p, q) string and an (r, s) 7-brane exhibits the creation of
|ps  qr| (r, s) strings, which implies the s-rule n  |ps  qr| [19]. similarly, a conguration of a
(p, q) 5-brane and an (r, s) 5-brane which have precisely one common transverse direction exhibit
the creation of |ps  qr| d3-branes [6]. this can be understood by decomposing each 5-brane
into its d5-brane and ns5-brane components, and applying the creation phenomenon piecewise.
the statement of the s-rule in this case is again n  |ps  qr|.

for the congurations we are interested in, i.e. an ns5-brane and a (k, 1) 5-brane oriented

as in 4(i,ii,iii), supersymmetry is therefore spontaneously broken when

n > |k| .

(24)

we conclude that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken in n = 3 sym-cs theory with gauge
group su(n) when n > |k|, and similarly in its n = 2 and n = 1 deformations.

13

3.3 susy breaking via instantons

other than congurations 4(i,ii,iii), the only remaining conguration which leads to a eld theory
with no massless scalars is 3(i). this conguration is a special case of 4(i), in which both 5-branes
are ns5-branes, i.e. (0, 1) 5-branes. the corresponding gauge theory has k = 0, and a naive
application of the preceding s-rule formula seems to imply that supersymmetry is broken for
n > 0, and in particular for n = 1. however, the latter is recognized as the free n = 1 u(1)
super-maxwell theory with three massive neutral matter multiplets. clearly supersymmetry
cannot be broken in this case.

to resolve the issue, recall that the s-rule is a consequence of brane creation, together with
the fact that only one of the two possible orientations of the suspended brane preserves super-
symmetry. in the above conguration there is no brane creation, which on the face of it seems to
imply the aforementioned bound. on the other hand, both orientations of the d3-brane preserve
supersymmetry in this case, so our derivation of the s-rule does not apply.

for n > 1 the theory is interacting, and supersymmetry might be broken, albeit via a dierent
mechanism than the s-rule. to see that this is indeed the case, consider the n = 1 conguration
3(i) as a deformation of the n = 2 conguration 2(i). the latter corresponds in the ir limit to
d = 3, n = 2 sym with a single massive n = 2 matter multiplet. the massless scalar eld in
the vector multiplet corresponds to the x3 positions of the d3-branes. this eld becomes massive
in the deformation from 2(i) to 3(i).

consider two d3-branes suspended between the two ns5-branes in the n = 2 conguration.
a euclidean d-string suspended between the four branes on the (x3, x6) plane then gives rise to
a superpotential [16]

w = ex3l/gs

,

(25)

where x3 is the separation between the d3-branes along x3, and l is the separation between
the ns5-branes along x6. there is therefore a repulsive interaction between the two d3-branes,
leading to a runaway behavior in x3.

now deform the conguration by rotating the second ns5-brane in the (x3, x7) plane, while
maintaining n = 1 supersymmetry. this corresponds to adding a mass term to the scalar eld
(and one of the fermions) in the n = 2 vector multiplet. in particular, this implies a mass term
for x3, and thus a total eective potential given by

v (x3) = m2(x3)2 + e2x3l/gs

.

(26)

since this has a non-degenerate minimum of nite non-vanishing energy, supersymmetry is bro-
ken. this also follows from the fact that in the minimum energy conguration the d3-branes are
separated a nite distance in x3, and can therefore not be parallel. we conclude that in n = 1
su(n) sym with three massive avors supersymmetry is broken when

n > 1 .

4 conclusions

brane congurations have once again proven themselves useful in deriving non-perturbative prop-
erties of supersymmetric quantum eld theories. here we have demonstrated dynamical super-
symmetry breaking in a class of three-dimensional gauge theories with a chern-simons term, by
studying their realization on congurations of d3-branes suspended between an ns5-brane and a
(p, q) 5-brane (at least for |q| = 1). these theories include n = 3 supersymmetric su(n) ym-cs
theory, as well as its n = 2 and n = 1 deformations, which contain in addition one and three
adjoint matter multiplets, respectively. supersymmetry is broken in the corresponding congu-
rations, via the s-rule, when the number of d3-branes n is larger than the cs coecient k.
this is in line with earlier interpretations of the s-rule as spontaneous supersymmetry breaking.
the above supersymmetry breaking regime is consistent with the low energy computation
of the supersymmetric index, which vanishes in precisely this regime. however the low energy
result is reliable only for large |k|, and one should really compare with a microscopic calculation.
such a calculation, as was done by witten for the pure n = 1 theory, is not yet available for the
n = 3 theory. the above agreement suggests however that, as in the pure n = 1 theory, the
low energy result should hold microscopically.

the case k = 0, i.e. no cs term, should be excluded from the supersymmetry breaking
regimes of the n = 3 (which is now really n = 4) and n = 2 theories, since these correspond to
the dimensional reduction of four-dimensional sym theory with n = 2 and n = 1, respectively.
this does not rule out supersymmetry breaking in the n = 1 theory with three massive avors
and k = 0. indeed we learn from the corresponding brane conguration that supersymmetry is
broken by an instanton generated repulsive potential between the d3-branes when n > 1.

there are two interesting issues which deserve future attention. the rst concerns the failure
of interpreting p/q as the cs coupling when |q| > 1. a non-integer cs coecient should be
allowed in the abelian case, and the corresponding brane conguration would be crucial in deriv-
ing the k  1/k duality of [13]. the second issue is whether there exists a brane conguration
for the pure n = 1 sym-cs theory, for which a microscopic calculation of the supersymmetric
index is available [10]. possible places to look for these congurations are brane boxes and brane
cubes.
