abstract

in continuum physics, there are important topological aspects like
instantons, -terms and the axial anomaly. conventional lattice dis-
cretizations often have diculties in treating one or the other of these
aspects. in this paper, we develop discrete quantum eld theories on
fuzzy manifolds using noncommutative geometry. basing ourselves
on previous treatments of instantons and chiral fermions (without
fermion doubling) on fuzzy spaces and especially fuzzy spheres, we
present discrete representations of -terms and topological suscepti-
bility for gauge theories and derive axial anomaly on the fuzzy sphere.
our gauge eld action for four dimensions is bounded by the modulus
of the instanton number as in the continuum.

1 introduction

conventional discretizations of quantum elds on a manifold m replace the
latter by a lattice of points. an alternative discretization which leads to fuzzy
physics treats m as a phase space and quantizes it. m is thereby altered
to a fuzzy manifold mf [18]. earliest investigations of quantization like
those of planck and bose show that quantization introduces a short distance
cut-o: the number of states in a phase space volume v is reduced from
innity to v /h3 if h plays the role of plancks constant. if m is compact,
the total number of states is also nite and we end up with a matrix model
for m. continuum physics in this approach has to do with the classical

limit h  0. functions on m commute, but they become noncommutative
on quantization. for that reason, the fuzzy path lands us in noncommutative
manifolds and their geometries [1,914]. as there are also reasonably orderly
methods to formulate quantum eld theories (qfts) on mf , fuzzication
promises to be a truly original development in discrete physics.
the earliest contributions to topological features of fuzzy physics came
from grosse, klimck and presnajder [4]. they dealt with monopoles and
chiral anomaly for the fuzzy two-sphere s2
f and took particular advantage
of supersymmetry. later we [15] further elaborated on their monopole work
and also developed descriptions of fuzzy -models and their solitons using
cyclic cohomology [9, 11] in an important manner. an attractive feature of
this cohomological approach is its ability to write analogues of continuum
winding number formulae and derive a fuzzy belavin-polyakov bound [15].

the work of [15] is extended in this paper to gauge theories and chiral
instantons, the -term and topological susceptibility are in
anomalies.
particular formulated on s2
f . they are not like the existing proposals in
discrete physics (cf. the work of luscher reported in ref. [16]), have sound
and rugged interpretations and promise to resolve problems of much age. as
for chiral fermions and anomaly on s2
f , it is known that fuzzy physics requires
no fermion doubling for watamuras dirac operator [6, 7]. unfortunately
it has zero modes, also there is another dirac operator [27] which gives
a much better approximation to the continuum spectrum. but it does not
have a chirality operator because of its highest frequency mode. this mode
recedes to innity and is totally unimportant in the continuum limit. in [17],
it is projected out and thereafter a chirality operator anticommuting with
this dirac operator is found without fermion doubling. this paper adapts
this operator to gauge theories and instanton physics and also derives the
axial anomaly. an alternative analysis of the latter can be found in grosse
et al [4]. we will briey review their work and compare it with ours in the
nal section. an interesting new treatment of chiral fermions and anomaly
is also discussed in [28].

not all manifolds m can be phase spaces. m has to be symplectic
and hence even dimensional. it must be quantizable to turn into mf , and
ideally m must be compact and mf admit a laplacian and dirac operator
with decent symmetry properties. manifolds with these nice features are
quantizable coadjoint orbits of compact lie groups. for simple and semi-
simple lie groups, they are also adjoint orbits. examples are cpn and
[t 2 is not in this category.] we focus on s2 and
s2  s2 (s2 being cp1).

2

s2  s2 in this paper as the basics of s2
f are under reasonable control. cp2
has been treated by [18] while our own approach to cpn and other orbits
is yet to appear in print. using s2 and s2  s2 as examples, we present
our considerations in such a manner that they can be easily be adapted to
general adjoint orbits once their fuzzy basics are assumed.

2 the fuzzy sphere

a sphere s2 is a submanifold of r3:

s2 = h~n  r3 :

xi=1

n2
i = 1i.

(2.1)

in contrast, the operators xi describing s2

if ni are the coordinate functions on s2, ni(~n) = ni, then ni commute and
the algebra a of smooth functions they generate is commutative.

f are noncommutative:

x2
i = 1,

[xi, xj] =

xi=1

(2.2)

the xi approach ni as l  . if li = [l(l + 1)]1/2xi, then [li, lj] = iijklk
and p l2
i = l(l + 1) so that li give the irreducible representation (irr) of
su(2) lie algebra for angular momentum l. li or xi generate the algebra
a = m2l+1 of (2l + 1)  (2l + 1) matrices.
scalar wave functions on s2 come from elements of a. in a similar way,
elements of a assume the role of scalar wave functions on s2
f . a scalar
product on a is h, i = t r. a acts on this hilbert space by left- and
right- multiplications giving rise to the left and right- regular representations
al,r of a. for each a  a, we thus have operators al,r  al,r acting on
[note that albl = (ab)l, arbr =
  a according to al = a, ar = a.
(ba)r.] we assume by convention that elements of al are to be identied
with functions on s2.

of particular interest are the angular momentum operators. there are
two kinds of angular momenta ll,r
f , while the orbital angular momen-
i . ~l plays the role
tum operator, which should annihilate 1 is li = ll
of the continuum i(~r  ~). the position operators are not proportional
to li, but are instead ll

i /[l(l + 1)]1/2.

the elements of a have a dual role, one as members of a hilbert space
and the second as operators on this space. we shall hereafter most often
denote these hilbert space vectors and their duals in a ket-bra notation
to minimize confusion. thus |i is the hilbert space vector for   a,
h|i = t r, al|i = |ai and ar|i = |ai.
there are two dirac operators d on s2 that are of particular importance
to us:

d1 = ~.[i(~r  ~)] + 1,
d2 = ijkinjjk,

where

jk = [i(~r  ~)]k + k/2 = total angular momentum operators.

there is a common chirality operator  anticommuting with both:

 = ~.n = , 2 = 1,

d + d = 0.

(2.3)
(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)
(2.7)

d and  act on spinors  = (1, 2) where i  a. also these dirac
operators in the continuum are unitarily equivalent,

d2 = exp (i/4)d1 exp (i/4)

(2.8)

and have the spectrum

spectrum of d = {(j + 1/2) : j  {1/2, 3/2, . . .}},

(2.9)
where j is total angular momentum (spectrum of ~j 2 = {j(j + 1)} ). there
is a circle of possibilities {e(i/2)d1e(i/2)}, in which the operators d are
just two points.

the discrete versions of d are

d1 = ~. ~l + 1,
d2 = ijkixl

j jk = ijkixl

where

jk = lk + k/2 = total angular momentum operators.

the hilbert space a has naturally to be enhanced to a2 = a  c2 once
the dirac operator comes into the picture. it is spanned by vectors {|i :
 = (1, 2), i  a} with the scalar product h|i = t r
i i. al,r act in an
obvious manner on this space, al|i = |ai, ar|i = |ai, while i|i is just
|ii. here (a)r = ar, (a)r = ra and (i)r = (i)rss.

then for ~l2 = k(k + 1), k  {0, 1, . . . 2l}, if j = k + 1/2 we get +(j + 1/2) as
eigenvalue, while if j = k1/2 we get (j +1/2). the absence of (2l +1/2)
in (2.13) is just because k cuts o at 2l.
it is remarkable that (2.13) coincides exactly with those of d upto j =
(2l  1/2). so d1 is an excellent approximation to d.
but d1 as it stands admits no chirality operator unless its eigenspace
with top eigenvalue is treated as a chiral singlet, or better still is projected
out. then it does admit a chirality operator as shown in detail in [17]. we

5

can summarize the results of [17] as follows. dene the operators

|d|

|d| = positive square root of d2
,
on the subspace v with j  2l  1/2,

= 0 on the subspace w with j = 2l + 1/2.

(2.17)

then 1, 2 and i12 anticommute, are hermitian and square to the projection
operator p where

p  = ,
= 0,

  v,
  w.

(2.18)
furthermore they all commute with |d| so that i12 is a chirality operator
for d.
as for d2, its spectrum (2.14) has been calculated in [6,7]. it has the fol-
lowing chirality too, anticommuting with d2, commuting with ~j and squaring
to 1 in the entire hilbert space v  w = a2:

,

(2.19)

(2.20)

as shown in [17], on v , it is a linear combination of 1 and i12 for each
xed ~j 2  j 2:

p 2p = e(i(j 2)2)/2(i12)e(i(j 2)2)/2,
= cos (j 2)(i12) + sin (j 2)1.

(2.21)

limit, 2 and p 2p approach the continuum  as they should.

the angle  is rotationally invariant and vanishes as l  .
the operator 2 has the important property that it commutes with xi

in that

l.

that is not the case with i12. it is thus useful to replace d1 by

e(i(j 2)2)/2d1e(i(j 2)2)/2.

noticing also that p is a function of only ~j 2 and that ~j 2 commutes with 2
and d, we construct our basic operators

d = e(i(j 2)2)/2(p d1p )e(i(j 2)2)/2,

f = e(i(j 2)2)/2(cid:18)p

and

(2.24)

they are all zero on w and leave its orthogonal complement v invariant.
they have the following additional fundamental properties on v :
(i) they are self-adjoint:

d = d, f  = f,  = .

(ii) f and  square to 1 on v :

f 2 = 2 = p.

(iii)  anticommutes with f and d:

{, f} = {, d} = 0.

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

so  is a chirality operator on v . there is no fermion doubling, and d is an
excellent approximation to d.

3 the projector p and the operator algebra

our presentation above must have betrayed our intention to project all to
the subspace v . but we can consistently do so without disturbing the math-
ematical formalism (even by small amounts) only if no operator we deal with
has matrix elements between v and w . we must therefore work only with
operators commuting with p .

this criterion is satised by d, f and , but not by al and ar. as we

cannot avoid their use, we correct them to commute with p .

let

(p ) = 2p  1, (p )2 = 1.
then to any operator , we can associate another:

(3.1)

p () =  +

1
2

(p )[, (p )] =

1
2

[ + (p )(p )].

(3.2)

it commutes with (p ),

p ()(p ) = (p )p ()

(3.3)

7

and its projections to v and w coincide with those of :

p p ()p = p p,

(1  p )p ()(1  p ) = (1  p )(1  p ).

(3.4)

we can think of 1
action of  from v  w to v and w .

it is interesting that

in future we will change operators like al,r not commuting with p to
their p -images. let p (al,r) be the algebra generated by p (al,r). from
(3.5), we see that they will contain small operators with no pre-image in
al,r and going to zero as l  .

it vanishes certainly as

connes approach to gauge theories is based on spectral triples and k-cycles
[914]. fredholm modules and cyclic cohomology [9] seem better suited for
fuzzy physics, especially for maintaining continuum topological features like
instanton bounds and -states. we have already seen this in work on fuzzy
monopoles [15], and give further supporting evidence in this paper. later
on, we will comment on the continuum limit of this approach, its full details
being reserved to future work [21].

alternative approaches to gauge theories on the fuzzy sphere have also

been developed by grosse and presnajder [4] and klimck [22].

in mathematics, fredholm modules and cyclic cohomology have played a
central role in the k-theory of algebras for many years [9], while rajeev and
coworkers [23, 24] have long appreciated their importance in the physics of
large-n gauge theories. here, we suggest their importance for fuzzy physics
too.

we rst introduce the concept of forms and then go on to formulate gauge
theories. all that we now do can be restricted to v . they are also suitable

8

for adaptation to general fuzzy spaces. however, the treatment of instantons
and monopoles is being postponed till section 6.

4.1 forms

these are constructed using f,  and p (al). for this work, in addition to
(2.25, 2.26, 2.27), it is important that

[, p (al)] = [, al +

1
2

(p )[al, (p )]] = 0.

(4.1)

this result is implied by the fact that  commutes with both al and p .

forms are linear spans of elements

 = p (al

0 )[f, p (al

1 )] . . . [f, p (al

)]

(4.2)

for all . their product can also be written as linear combinations of terms
like (4.2) using properties of derivations. (for instance, [f, p (al)]p (bl) =
[f, p (al)p (bl)]  p (al)[f, p (bl)]).
forms are z2-graded by : those  with  even commute with  and give
us the space of even forms 0[p (al)] while those  with  odd anticommute
with  and give us the space of odd forms 1[p (al)].

we can assign degrees  to  (=0 or 1 if  = 0 or 1) which is additive

(mod 2). the degree of  is  +  (mod 2).

there is a derivation d between 0[p (al)] and 1[p (al)] which squares

to zero. it is given by the graded commutator with f :

d = f   (1)f  [f, } ,
d2 = 0.

(4.3)
(4.4)

the operator d resembles the dierential in manifold theory and leads to a
homology theory for p (al).

4.2 connections and curvatures

connections () and curvatures f () depend on lie-algebra valued one-
forms . for u(m) gauge theories, if t () ( = 0, 1, . . . m 21) are m m

9

antihermitian matrices spanning the lie algebra u(m) of u(m), then

p (

 = t ()p (
p (al,j

1 ) = xj

1 ),
 )[f, p (bl,j

 )],

p (

1 ) = p (

1 ), p (al,j

 ), p (bl,j

 )  p (al).

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

 is a linear operator on

am  c2 = {| = (j)i,  = 1, . . . m; j = 1, 2, j  a}.

(4.8)

here,  is the internal symmetry index on which t () act and j is the spin
index. the scalar product for am  c2 is the evident one:

h|i = t rx,j


jj.

() and f () are the following operators:

() = d + ,
f () = d + 2  {f, } + 2.

(4.9)

(4.10)
(4.11)

[both act on p (al)m  c2  p (al)m +2, with d being the derivation. f ()
is also a linear operator on am  c2.]

the gauged version of f on am  c2 is this:

gauged version of f = f + .

(4.12)

the u(m) gauge group consists of m  m unitary matrices u with uij 

p (al). they act on () and f () in the usual way:

()  u()u,
f ()  uf ()u.

(4.13)
(4.14)

we can describe gauge theories for a subgroup g  u(m) by restricting
. that is, if t () span the lie algebra g of g, we can decide to consider
only  = t ()p (
(but that would not guarantee that f () has an
expansion containing only t () since p (
1 ) may not anticommute
in the term 2 = t () t ()p (
1 ).) in the same vein, when considering
covariant derivative in a representation  of u(m), we change t () to its
representative in the lie algebra  of .

5 the actions and quantization

5.1 critical dimensions

in connes approach, the euclidean actions for free massless scalars, spinors
and gauge elds on a manifold of dimension n and dirac operator d are
respectively,

s() = constant t r+(cid:20) 1
s() = constant t r+(cid:20) 1
s() = constant t r+(cid:20) 1

|d|n(cid:0)[d, ][d, ](cid:1)(cid:21) ,
|d|n d(cid:21) ,
|d|n(cid:0)[d, ] + 2(cid:1)(cid:0)[d, ] + 2(cid:1)(cid:21) .

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

here t r+ is dixmier trace, n is spacetime dimension, and ,  and  are
scalar, spinor and gauge elds respectively.
[issues involving junk forms
are being ignored.]

under the scaling transformation d  d, the response of  is   .

hence under d  d,

s()  2ns(),
s()  1ns(),
s()  4ns().

(5.4)
(5.5)
(5.6)

gauging d does not aect (5.4) and (5.5).
n = 2 for , n = 1 for  and n = 4 for .

the critical dimensions where actions are scale-invariant are thus

we rst propose actions for fuzzy scalars and gauge elds in their critical

dimensions, n = 1 being outside our modeling scope.

5.2 n = 2 fuzzy massless scalar fields

a fuzzy scalar eld  for n = 2 is a polynomial in p (al). if it has internal
degrees of freedom, it is a vector with each component  being such a
polynomial.

our (euclidean) action for a zero mass non-interacting fuzzy scalar

eld  is

s() = f 2t rp [dp ()][dp ()]

(5.7)

11

where the internal index , if any, is summed within the trace. it can be
gauged in an evident manner by replacing d by (). it is scale invariant
just like (5.1).
in ref [15], the analogue of this action for fuzzy -models was proposed
and its belavin-polyakov bound [25] was discussed. as suggested there, we
conjecture that as l  , f 2 can be scaled in such a way that s() ap-
proaches s(). work on this matter is in progress [21].

5.3 n = 4 fuzzy gauge field

the formalism of cyclic cohomology and gauge theories depends only on the
knowledge of suitable d and chirality operators. for n = 4, there are two
fuzzy spaces that are susceptible to our analysis, namely s2
f and (cp2)f .
the former is enough for illustration. the algebra for that space is a c a
respectively (f and  being those of s2

while its d and chirality operators are(cid:2)1/2(f c 1 +  c f ), .(cid:9) and  

f s2

our proposed action is the evident one:

f .)

s() =

1
2e2 t rp {f ()f ()} .

(5.8)

it is accompanied by a conjecture like that for s[] about its l   limit.
it is scale invariant like s() of n = 4.
for (cp2)f as well, our action looks the same as (5.8). but we have yet
to tell what d and the chirality operator are, a task postponed to later work.

5.4 away from criticality

our guide for the choice of actions for any n continues to be scaling prop-
erties and gauge invariance. also in our formulas for general n, the precise
denitions of p, d, f and d1 require future elucidation.

(a) scalars

the action for  for any n is suggested by (5.4) to be

s() = f 2t rp|d|2n[()p ()][()p ()]

(5.9)

[for n = 2,|d| is invertible on v .]
the formulation of gauge invariant actions for fuzzy spinor and gauge elds

(b) the eld g

12

requires the introduction of a matrix eld g. its components gab are poly-
nomials in p (al). it is unitary and commutes with p :

gg = 1,
gp = p g.

the index a carries the action of the gauge transformations u:

u : g  ug

(5.10)
(5.11)

(5.12)

(c) spinors

a fuzzy spinor  is an element of the hilbert space on which operators like
, d and elements of al,r can act. in the presence of internal symmetry, it
has components ,j (c.f. 4.8). the gauged action is suggested by (5.5):

s(, g) = h|p g(cid:18)

1

|d|(n1)/2(cid:19) g(f + )g(cid:18)

it depends on both  and g.

we can now dene a new dirac eld

1

|d|(n1)/2(cid:19) gp|i.

(5.13)

|i = g(cid:18)

1

|d|(n1)/2(cid:19) g|i

which transforms in the same way as |i under the gauge group,

but which scales dierently:

u : |i  u|i,

|i  (1n)/2|i under d  d.

the spinor action is thus

s() = h|p [f + ]p|i

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)

(d) gauge fields

where  scales as in (5.16). (we assume as for n = 2 that [|d|, p ] = 0.)
the n 6= 4 gauge eld action, like (5.13), depends on both  and g and reads
(5.18)

s(, g) =

1

2e2 t rp(cid:2)g|d|4ng(cid:3)f ()2.

13

compatibly with (5.6).

there is a certain freedom in the choice of gauge eld action. any one of

the following actions are a priori equally acceptable:

sa(, g) =

1

2e2 t rp(cid:2)g|d|ag(cid:3)f ()(cid:2)g|d|bg(cid:3) f (),

a + b = 4  n.

(5.19)

(e) a remark

in the continuum limit, if t r goes over to t r+ as we conjecture, we can
cancel g with g in (5.13), (5.18) and (5.19) [9,12,14] and the dependence on
g disappears.

(f ) mass and interaction terms

mass and interaction terms can also be introduced with guidance from con-
tinuum scaling properties and from gauge invariance. we omit the simple
details.

(g) quantization

quantization can be done using functional integration. we can for example
try to expand the elds in normal modes and integrate exp (action) over
the coecients in the mode expansions to dene the partition function. this
method is especially useful for the dirac eld for which the normal modes
are given by an orthonormal basis of the hilbert space and the coecients
of the expansion are grassmann numbers.

6 on twisted bundles and fuzzy physics

in the continuum, instantons are particular connection elds  on certain
twisted bundles over the base manifold m. on s2, they are monopole bun-
dles, on s4 or cp2, they can be su(2) bundles. for such reasons, we may
henceforth refer to monopoles also as instantons.

in algebraic k-theory [914, 27], it is well-known that these bundles are
associated with projectors p. p is a matrix of some dimension m with
pij  a  c(m), p 2 = p = p . the physical meaning of p is the
following. let am = a  cm = { = (1, 2 . . . m ) : i  a}. then
pam = {p :   am} consists of smooth sections (or wave functions) p
of a vector bundle over m. for suitable choices of p, we get monopole or
instanton vector bundles. these projectors are known [13, 27] and those for
monopoles have been reproduced in [15].

the projectors p(n ) for fuzzy monopoles of charge n have also been
found in [15]. they act on a2n = { with components b1...bn  a, bi 
{1, 2}}. let ~ (i) (i = 1, 2, . . . n) be commuting pauli matrices. ~ (i) has
the normal action on the index bi and does not aect bj (j 6= i). then
~k = ~ll +pi ~ (i)/2 generates the su(2) lie algebra and p(n ) (p(n )) is the
projector to the maximum (minimum) angular momentum kmax = l + n/2

beyond this space, once the basic ingredients become available.

6.1 cyclic cohomology of twisted sectors

all the complications resolved here are caused by the need to project out a
subspace of a2n+1. it is the analogue of the subspace projected out by p for
n = 0. in its absence, for example in the continuum, there is a canonical way
to extend cyclic cohomology to twisted bundles. it is also due to connes [9].
the material being explained now has been partially reported in [17]. it
is not essential reading in all its details for what follows once it is accepted
that a certain subspace of a2n+1 can be consistently projected out.

in the n = 0 sector, the projector p cuts out the subspace w of a2. the
function of the map   p () of operators is to make them compatible with
the splitting a2 = v  w .
when we pass to p(n )a2n and thence to p(n )a2n+1 by including spin,
the subspace to be projected out is not determined by p if n 6= 0, as we shall
see below. rather, we can explain it as follows: let ~j = ~k  ~lr + ~/2 be
the total angular momentum. calling ~j by this name is appropriate as it
becomes (2.12) for n = 0 and displays the known spin-isospin mixing [19,
20] for n 6= 0. the maximum of ~j 2 on p(n )a2n+1 is jmax(jmax + 1), jmax =
(l  n/2) + l + 1/2 = 2l  n/2 + 1/2. [we assume that 2l  (n  1)/2.] the
vectors to be projected out are those with total angular momentum jmax. if

15

j (n ) are the corresponding projectors [with j (0) = p ], the twisted space
we work with is thus j (n )p(n )a2n+1. since p(n ) commute with ~j and
hence with j (n ), q(n ) = j (n )p(n ) are also projectors.
there is no degeneracy for angular momentum jmax in p(n )a2n+1. that
is because there is only one way to couple l  n/2, l and 1/2 to jmax. the
space (1j (n ))p(n )a2n+1 is thus of dimension 2jmax + 1. we want to get
rid of this subspace.
the operators t = d, f or  of section 2 are zero on (1 p )a2 where p
cuts out states of angular momentum 2l+1/2. there is no degeneracy for this
angular momentum in a2. t and p extend canonically to a2c2n ( a2n+1)
as t1 and p1. let us call them once more as t and p . t and p commute
with ~j and hence with j (n ). there is only one way to couple n isospin
1/2s to (2l + 1/2) to get jmax so that (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1 is also of
dimension 2jmax + 1. and t is zero on this subspace.
the projectors (1  j (n ))p(n ) and (1  j (n ))(1  p ) being of the
same rank, there exists a unitary operator u on a2n+1 transforming one to
the other:

(1  j (n ))p(n ) = u(1  j (n ))(1  p )u 1.

if we transport t by u,

t  = ut u 1,

(6.1)

(6.2)

then t  = d, f  or  vanishes on (1j (n ))p(n )a2n+1. on its orthogonal
complement [1(1j (n ))p(n )]a2n+1, invariant under t , f  and  square
to unity and  anticommutes with d and f , just as we want. what replaces
p now is not j (n ), but rather

p (n ) = [1  (1  j (n ))p(n )],
p (0) = p.

(6.3)
(6.4)

let u approach 1. that is, no u is needed in the continuum limit.

as l  , jmax becomes dominated by 2l and so we have the freedom to
since p(n ) dene dierent topological sectors, we also have the freedom
to choose dierent us for these sectors. but as both these sectors come from
a2n+1, it is convenient to nd a single u valid for both.

total angular momentum 2l + 1/2 + n/2 has no multiplicity in a2n+1.
as both (1 j (n ))(1 p )a2n+1 and (1 j (n ))p(n )a2n+1 have this angular

16

momentum, we have that

(1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1

= (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1

.

so we choose

u = 1 on (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1

.

next in accordance with (6.1), we set

u(1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1

= (1  j (n ))p(n )a2n+1

.

we also demand that

[u, ji] = 0.

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

that xes u upto a phase on the subspace (1  j (n ))(1  p )a2n+1.
we saw in [15] that (1  )/2 are projectors for combining ~lr and
~/2 to give angular momenta l  1/2. so  = +1 on all the subspaces
(1j (n ))(1p )a2n+1, (1j (n ))(p(n ))a2n+1. also, (p ~ (i)
2 +1)
on these subspaces. it follows that (6.6), (6.7) and (6.8) are compatible with
a u commuting with ji, , (~lr + ~/2)2 and (p ~ (i)
)2. we now outline an
extension of u to all of a2n+1 consistently with rotational invariance (6.8)

ji,(cid:18)~lr +

and (cid:18)x ~ (i)

therefore, the same is the case with x  and x . we can extend u to a map
x   x  which commutes with the above operators. there would still be
uncertainties about choosing u requiring further conventions for elimination.

the analogue of the n = 0 map   p () is just   p (n )().
we can now reproduce sections 4 and 5 for any n using t  and p (n )(al).
although t  and forms are operators on p (n )a2n+1, that is not the space

of sections for the twisted bundles. the latter is, rather,

q(n )a2n+1

= p(n )j (n )a2n+1

= p(n )p (n )a2n+1

.

(6.15)

it is not an invariant subspace for d and f  unless they are projected, or
corrected by connections. we shall do that below. however, chirality  is
well-dened on twisted sections because of (6.11).

for notational simplicity, we now permanently rename t , p (n ) and

q(n ) as follows:

d, f ,   d, f, ,

p(n )  p,
p (n )  p,
q(n )  q.

a generic operator p () will not commute with p. it must be changed

to pp ()p.

the bound on continuum action saturated by instantons. that is enough to
identify fuzzy instantons, topological susceptibility and -term.

we can thus regard (7.12) as dening fuzzy instantons and anti-instantons.
we can go a step further and propose a topological susceptibility. let tr

labeling components of ak). then fuzzy topological susceptibility is

8 axial anomaly

f in this section.

we show three connected results for s2
(a) on the space qak+2, the dirac operator qdq as also qf q have exactly
n zero modes of chirality  = +1 if p is p(n ) (and chirality  = 1 if p is
p(n )).
(b) n, which are the indices of f+, are given by (7.10) for 1 = 0.
(c) the expression (7.10) is independent of 1.

in view of fujikawas argument [26], (a) shows how axial anomaly appears
(in its integrated form) in the presence of instantons. (b) and (c) supply
the missing arguments for the last section. while the focus is on s2
f , the
methodology is not so limited and can generalize to any fuzzy space.

instantons and zero modes

we prove (a) in this subsection.

the operators qdq = pdp, qf q = pf p and  commute with ~j = ~k 
~lr + ~/2. spaces with xed ~j 2, j3 are thus invariant under these operators.
for xed ~j 2, j3, let  be the eigenvalue of either of the operators t = pdp
or pf p. as  anticommutes with t and commutes with ~j, for each eigenstate
with  6= 0, there is another with  and same ~j 2, j3. eigenvalues  6= 0
come in pairs with same ~j 2, j3.

figure 1: addition of angular momenta for p = p(n ).

consider for specicity p = p(n ). then kmax = l + n/2 gives the
eigenspace kmax(kmax + 1) for ~k 2. adding ~lr and then ~/2 gives the
spectrum j(j + 1) of ~j 2. we nd j = {(l + n/2) + l,   (l + n/2) l} 1/2.
figure 1 shows how the addition of angular momenta is working. this
explanation is a bit of a repetition of what we did in 6.1.

all the js occur with multiplicity 2 except the topmost with j = jmax =
2l + (n + 1)/2 and the lowermost with j = jmin = (n  1)/2. vectors with
jmax and jmin are necessarily zero modes of t .
vectors with jmax are unphysical just like their n = 0 siblings in section
2. now p projects out the unpaired state with j = jmax. hence the remain-
ing zero modes after projection by pp have j = jmin. their multiplicity is
n as claimed. also ~lr and /2 must combine to l + 1/2 to create jmin
as l  1/2 cannot combine with kmax = l + n/2 and give (n  1)/2. the
projector for getting this l + 1/2 is just (1 + )/2 [15]. thus these zero modes
have left helicity as claimed.

next let p = p(n ). then kmax is changed to kmin = l  n/2 and the
unpaired jmax = 2l  (n  1)/2 is once more eliminated by p . all other
j are paired except for (l  1/2)  (l  n/2) = (n  1)/2. these give the
necessary zero modes. there are n of them. as the projector for l  1/2 is
(1  )/2 [15], they are right-chiral. all these are as claimed.

22

2 t 1+

2 has index n if p = p(n ).

we have now established that 1
let  be a smooth perturbation of t (for example due to 1) changing it
from t (0) = t to t () such that t () + t () = 0. we can say that if v()
is the eigenspace of t () for eigenvalue () 6= 0 [(0) = ], then v() =
v() is its eigenspace for opposite eigenvalue and with same dimension.
also the multiplicities of states with opposite chiralities in v()  v() are
equal. v() are just the deformations of v(0) as  is continuously turned
on and have dimensions independent of . as the zero modes of t have a
unique chirality, it follows that they cannot become modes with non-zero
eigenvalues as  is changed, lacking vectors with opposite chirality to pair
with. the index of 1

is hence stable under such perturbations.

and for any n.

or

p[f, p] = [f, p](1  p),

(1  p)[f, p] = [f, p]p.

9 final remarks

in this paper we have proposed a formulation of fuzzy physics using cyclic
cohomology. it relies especially on the theory of chiral fermions of s2
f (with

24

no fermion doubling) as elaborated in [17]. its distinct characteristic is the
ease with which it reproduces continuum topological features like instantons,
-terms and axial anomaly. we remark in this context that we did not
explicitly write the n 6= 0 versions of all the actions in section 5. but that
is easily done by changing the projector p to q and reinterpreting symbols
like  and f ().
this paper oers persuasive evidence that a combination of fuzzy mani-
folds and cyclic cohomology can become a potent approach to discretization
of continuum physics.

there is overlap of this work with previous research [4] on fuzzy physics,
especially as regards the treatment of chiral anomalies. we conclude the
paper with a brief comparison of the two approaches. peter presnajder had
an essential role in its composition.

in the formalism of [4], a central role is played by a spin-1/2 variable
z = (z1, z2), z 6= 0. the spatial coordinates ni of s2 are identied with
(ziz)/zz while the left- and right- chiral components of the dirac spinor
on s2 in the presence of a monopole eld with monopole number 2k = n
(n  0) are

(+)(z, z) = x|m||n|=2k1

a multi-index notation is being used with m = (m1, m2), zm = zm1
|m| = |m1| + |m2| etc.
the spinor z, after the normalization zz = 1, describes the three-sphere
s3 as a hopf bration over s2. thus () are being represented here as
functions of the twisted principal bundle c2  {0} over s2 (with structure
group u(1)  r1, r1 being dilatations). this is an important point.

where a restriction on |m| + |n| has been introduced. since  and  trans-
form as spinors, it eliminates all angular momenta > j0  1/2. further, the
maximum of |n|, and the maximum power of annihilators in f (or g) is j0  k
(or j0  k  1).
[it is assumed the j0  |k| + 1.] the domain of f (or g)
is accordingly restricted in [4] to the vectors ()j0k|0i (or ()j0k1|0i)
of angular momentum (j0  k)/2 (or (j0  k  1)/2).
[|0i is the vacuum
annihilated by .] with this restriction, f and g can be interpreted as
nite-dimensional matrices.

note that the domains of f and g dier in their spinorial character:

if
one has integral angular momenta, the other has half-odd integral angular
momenta. this suggests the introduction of supersymmetry [4].

as angular momentum is being cut-o at the same value j0  1/2 in
both f and g, each angular momentum in the fuzzy spinor occurs with both
chiralities. this technique of cut-o thus projects out the analogue of the
unwanted top mode in our work.

the relation between j0 here and our l can be found by comparing the

top total angular momenta:

j0 = 2l + k = 2l  n/2.

(9.5)

here the choice among the  signs is determined by the sign of k.
although until this point there is a good correspondence between the
two approaches, there is an important aspect besides supersymmetry which
dierentiates the two. the chiral elds () are functions on the bundle
c2  {0} for any instanton number 2k. they are like the wave functions
for dirac monopoles [29]. in particular there are no separate operators for
orbital angular momentum and spin in this formalism.

in contrast, in our approach, there are separate operators ll,r

and li
for characterizing orbital angular momentum. furthermore, in the sectors
with instanton numbers n, we have to introduce n isospin operators

i

26

~ (i)/2 and combine them with orbital angular momentum and spin to nd
the total angular momentum ~j. this construction is the analogue of the
similar construction [19, 20] for the t hooft-polyakov monopoles. thus our
approach has a close correspondence to the description of the latter on the
sphere at innity.

now in the continuum, it is possible to map one description to the other
in a well-understood way [30]. a similar possibility for fuzzy physics has not
been investigated.

although the two approaches seem to dier in this manner, both have a
dirac and chirality operator which mutually anti-commute. that is enough
to guarantee the presence of zero modes responsible for chiral anomaly. thus
we can see from (9.3, 9.4) that for 2k = n > 0 the minimum angular
momentum (|m|  |n|)/2 = (n  1)/2 occurs only in f (while the rest occur
in both f and g). the corresponding zero modes of the dirac operator are
therefore of positive chirality and multiplicity n. if 2k = n < 0, these
zero modes are seen to have negative chirality, but the same multiplicity. all
this is exactly as we found.

further studies contrasting the two methods would be useful to expose

their relative merits for particular problems.
