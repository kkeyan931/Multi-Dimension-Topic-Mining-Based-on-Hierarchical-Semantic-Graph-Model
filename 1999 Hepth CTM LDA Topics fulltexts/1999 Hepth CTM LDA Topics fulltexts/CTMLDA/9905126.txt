(2.4) note (2.4) repeated indices j summed. now, suppose eadi given dierentiations function fd (the dual prepotential) fd = fd adi . eadi := (fdi)jk = (fi)jl(d)lk, eai rxl=1 = 3fd adiadj adk 3fd eaieajeak (2.5) (2.6) (2.7) relation (2.4) rewritten (fdi)jk := (d)lk := dlk matrix notations overall factor ignored necessary following discussions. note right hand side (2.6) simply matrix multiplication. aid (2.6), easy see (fdi)pl(fdk)1 lm(fdj )mn = (fi)pl(fk)1 lm(fj)mq(d)qn, (2.8) (fdk)1 lm mean (l, m) components (fdk)1 ignored determinants (fk) (d) arising (fdk)1 summarized overall factor. thus (2.8) (1.1), obtain dual form wdvv equations (fdi)(fdk)1(fdj ) = (fdj )(fdk)1(fdi).
