consider sl(2) transformation simple case, changing k1 = np1 k1 = rk1, k4 = 20 sk1, r, mutually prime. application sl(2) transformation denote n = x +, p1 = x e2,3 = x 2,3 before, furthermore b2 = e3, b3 = e2. acting elds element sl(2) results new conguration n, e2 e3 r times former expression, whereas p1, b2,3 remain unaected. furthermore, p2, p3 b1 also get value dierent zero. would quantise simple theory before, apply transforma- tion, course get desired degeneracy, d(np1). however, quite correct, since new conguration satisfy required commu- tation relations: new e b commutator r times large. also understood transformation m-commutation relations, given equation (7.4): formally, derivative non-zero, 1, transformed r1 + s4. new conguration taken depend x1, demand 4 zero. leaves us commutation relation r times previous value. ensure correct commutation relations sl(2) transformation, therefore scale commutation relations x factor r. however, compute degeneracy pre-transformation, simple state p1 n non-zero, rescaled relations seem get degeneracy d(rnp1) rather d(np1). situation saved observation {$9707179$}, allowed twists gener- ating long strings take values sn , rather sn , n = gcd(n, b1). elds transformation period r times smaller naively expected. therefore, oscillators allowed: oscillator num- bers r times larger without requirement. end, combina- tion rescaling commutation relations, plus rescaling allowed periodicity elds, gives us correct result degeneracy: d(gcd(k)) = d(p gcd(n, b1)). acting conguration sl(4) keeping vector k invariant works similarly case k pointing 1-direction, gives degeneracy. congurations k trivially obtained using sl(2) sl(3) transformations. concludes demonstration u-invariance degeneracies long string sector. next investigate contributions multiple string states. 7.1. multi-particle bps states far considered degeneracy associated sector involving long 21 strings, i.e. congurations containing one single bps bound state. principle also possible construct multi-particle bps states, whose charges add total charge. symmetric product string sigma model identied states twisted sectors conjugacy class n partitioned one piece. states bps, necessary component states annihilated supersymmetry, or, equivalently, total energy precisely sum constituent bps energies. m-theory, implies charge matrices component states proportional. yang-mills theory turned case {$9707179$};
