abstract

we investigate the prepotential that describes certain f 4 couplings
in eight dimensional string compactications, and show how they can be
computed from the solutions of inhomogenous dierential equations. these
appear to have the form of the picard-fuchs equations of a bration of
sym2(k3) over ip1. our ndings give support to the conjecture that the
relevant geometry which underlies these couplings is given by a ve-fold.

1. introduction

in string theories with extended supersymmetry, bps-saturated amplitudes [13]

play an important role for non-trivial tests of various kinds of dualities. they tend to

be characterized by holomorphic quantities (e.g. prepotentials), and this is why one

often can use geometrical methods to compute them exactly. typically, the counting of

bps states that contribute to a given amplitude can be mapped to the computation

of the euler characteristic of a space of geometric moduli. for prepotentials this

generically reduces to the counting of curves in some complex manifold x, and this

manifold may, or may not have a concrete physical meaning in some appropriate dual

formulation of the theory. in practice, this counting is often done via mirror symmetry

[4], which boils down to computing the periods of the mirror of x.

some of the most canonical bps-saturated amplitudes involve an even number,

n, of external gauge bosons in theories with 4n supercharges in 2n dimensions. these
amplitudes arise in heterotic string compactications on y  t 2, where y is some
(4  n)-fold. in the following, we will focus only on the subsector of the theory that

depends on the familiar torus moduli t and u (neglecting any wilson lines), and
m(t, u )ft  ...ft  fu  ...fu , which are
consider couplings of the form ft
saturated by 1/2-bps states. in the heterotic string formulation, the perturbative

piece is given by a one-loop amplitude that involves [5] the heterotic elliptic genus [6]
an in 2n + 2 dimensions, e.g.,
n =z d2

by explicitly performing the modular integral in (1.1) for general n, we nd

(by extensive calculations generalizing methods developed in [7,1,810]) that these
couplings satisfy non-trivial integrability conditions. these imply that the couplings

 an explicit demonstration of this for n = 6 is given in appendix a.

real coecients), qt  e2it , qu  e2iu , and lia(z) =pp>0
genus, an(q) =:pk1 c{n}(k)qk, which is a modular form of weight n.

of course, for n = 2 (i.e., n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions) the situation
is well understood; the prepotential is nothing other than the eective lagrangian of
special geometry [11]. a dual formulation is given by type ii a/b strings compactied
on the familiar k3-bered calabi-yau threefold x24(1, 1, 2, 8, 12)480
, and its mirror.
the mirror symmetry allows to exactly compute the full non-perturbative prepotential
f{2}(s, t, u ), which also involves the dilaton modulus, s. the one-loop prepotential
f{2}(t, u ) in (1.2), with

is then reproduced [12] in the weak coupling limit, s  , where the non-perturbative
corrections disappear.

on the other hand, the situation is much less well understood for n = 4, which
corresponds to n = 1 supersymmetry (16 supercharges) in eight dimensions, and
where

(1.4)

an interesting issue is to nd a geometrical computation that would lead to the
prepotential f (4)(t, u ), in an analogous manner to the more familiar computation
that leads to f (2)(t, u ).

 not the least because an appropriate generalization of special geometry, in which f (4)(t, u)
would gure as a superspace lagrangian, is not known. however, see [13] for some recent
progress in eight dimensional lagrangians.

since the dual formulation of the eight-dimensional heterotic compactication on
t 2 is given by f -theory [14] compactied on k3, one would expect that f (4)(t, u )
should be computable in terms of the geometrical data of k3. the main puzzle is
that the prepotential f (4)(t, u ) does not seem to be in any obvious way related to
k3, but rather looks like a prepotential that would canonically come from a ve-fold.
this is essentially because its fth derivatives have exactly the structure as world-
5mf (4)(t, u ) = const +
sheet instanton corrected yukawa couplings, i.e. t

mu

some preliminary investigations in this direction have been presented in [9,15],
and in particular in [15] evidence was found that the relevant ve-fold should be
given by the symmetric square, sym2(k3), bered over ip1 (where the size of ip1
is eventually taken to be innite). this structure was uncovered by investigating
certain other couplings (involving four external non-abelian gauge elds), for which
no prepotential exists. it is the purpose of the present paper to extend this analysis
4m and their prepotential f (4)(t, u ), and gather further
to the couplings ft
evidence that the relevant underlying quantum geometry is given by such a ve-fold.

mfu

here we will not, however, try to answer the question as to what the physical
interpretation of this ve-fold might be, if there is any at all. the situation is, in
this respect, somewhat similar to n = 2 sym theory in four dimensions, where
the riemann surfaces underlying the eective lagrangian was found in [16], and at
the time the geometry appeared to be merely a convenient mathematical tool for
encoding appropriate data. it was only later that the geometry was given a much
deeper physical interpretation. in the same spirit, one may speculate that the ve-
folds that seem to emerge here may ultimately have an interpretation in terms of
a yet unknown dual formulation of the theory, or, perhaps more likely, in terms of
sigma-models describing the relevant 7-brane interactions [9] that lead to the requisite
f 4 terms in the eective action.
indeed, sigma models on symmetric products of
k3 do naturally appear in d-brane physics [19], so that there is hope that we may
eventually learn something substantially new about how to do exact non-perturbative
computations.

in the next section, we will review how the perturbative prepotential f (2)(t, u )
arises geometrically;
in particular, we will derive the inhomogenous picard-fuchs
equations that capture the relevant information of the k3 bration in the large base

 for example, as part of world-volumina of type iia [17] or m-theory [18] vebranes.

space limit. the motivation is, of course, to subsequently apply the reverse of this
procedure to the eight-dimensional situation, where we want to start from the known
perturbative prepotential f (4)(t, u ), to arrive at a large base space limit of some
bration. this will be done in section 3, where we will nd that the periods of the ber
are given by the squares of the ordinary k3 periods, i.e. by (1, t, u, t u, t 2, u 2, t 2u 2).
these are precisely the periods of the hyperkahler symmetric square of k3, which we
denote by sym2(k3). in the appendix, we formally extend this reasoning to n = 6
external gauge bosons, and relate f (6)(t, u ) to cubic powers of the k3 periods. more
generally, we conclude that the prepotentials f (n)(t, u ) can be formally related to
(n + 1)-folds, given by ip1 brations of symmetric products, symn/2(k3). finally, we
will present some comments on curve counting in k3.

2. the prepotential f (2) in the large base-space limit

the dening polynomial of the calabi-yau manifold x24(1, 1, 2, 8, 12)480

is given by

p = x2

1 + x3

2 + x12

3 + x24

4 + x24

5  120x1x2x3x4x5  21(x3x4x5)6  2(x4x5)12 . (2.1)

as described in [12], this calabi-yau manifold may be thought of as a bration of a
k3 family of type x12(1, 1, 4, 6) over the ip1 base dened by the coordinates x1, x2.
moreover this k3 is itself an elliptic bration over ip1 with generic ber x6(1, 2, 3).

the variables that are appropriate for describing the complex structure near the
point of maximal unipotent monodromy in the large complex structure limit are:
x =  21
. in these variables the picard-fuchs (pf) system,
which determines the three-fold periods, becomes [20]

denoting the at coordinates by s, t and u , in the usual manner, the prepotential

of this calabi-yau manifold can be written in the form

f{2}(s, t, u ) = st u + f{2}(t, u ) +

xn=1

gn(t, u ) qs

n ,

(2.4)

where qs = e4s, and y  qs as s  . in this expression, the rst term is the
classical part, and the second term, f{2}(t, u ), may be thought of as the perturbative
one-loop part of the prepotential that comes from the k3 ber. the last sum is
over world-sheet instantons that wrap the base, which gives the non-perturbative
corrections from the heterotic string point of view. our aim is to extract the function
f{2}(t, u ), and compare  it with the heterotic one-loop prepotential given in (1.2).
to do this we must carefully take the limit s   in the pf system, keeping track
all the divergent and nite parts.

let 0 and 0 be the fundamental periods of the calabi-yau and the k3, respec-
tively. they are the unique solutions of (2.2) and (2.3) with nite limits at x = 0 and
z = 0. then the following represents the asymptotics (as s  ) of the calabi-yau
three-fold periods:

0  0

t 0  t 0

u 0  u 0

f{2}s 0  t u 0 ,

s0  (log(y) + 0(t, u ))0

f{2}t 0  (u (log(y) + 0(t, u )) + f{2}t (t, u ))0
f{2}u 0  (t (log(y) + 0(t, u )) + f{2}u (t, u ))0
f{2}0 0  (t u (log(y) + 0(t, u )) + f{2}0

(t, u ))0 .

(2.5)

we see that in this limit, the rst four cy periods turn directly into the periods of the
k3 ber, which are the solutions of (2.3). on the other hand, the non-trivial function
that we seek, f{2}(t, u ), is encoded in the remaining half of the periods. these are
governed by an inhomogenous picard-fuchs system [15], whose homogenous part is
exactly the system (2.3) of the k3 ber, and whose source part stems from y in dcy

2

 of course, this has been already done before in [12]; our purpose here is to formulate the

problem in a way that allows an easy generalization to eight dimensions.

hitting log(y) (which survives the y  0 limit). more precisely, it follows from (2.2)
and (2.5) that if jk are the solutions to

dk3

1 (jk0) = 0 ,

dk3

2 (jk0) = t j u k (z 0) ,

(2.6)

then we have

0 = 00 ,
10 = f{2}u + t 00 ,

01 = f{2}t + u 00 ,

11 = f{2}0 + t u 00 ,

(2.7)

and in particular, from homogeneity:

f{2}(t, u ) = 11  t 01  u 10 + t u 00 ,

(2.8)

which reects the familiar relation f = 1

2 x afa of special geometry.

to explicitly see that (2.8) indeed coincides with the heterotic one-loop expression
(1.2), we rst need to simplify the pf system (2.2). to accomplish this, we make a
change of variables to w1, w2, where:

x =

z =

1

864 h 1  p(1  w1) (1  w2)i ,

w1w2

4

(w1 + w2  w1w2)2 h 1 + p(1  w1) (1  w2)i2

from the explicit expressions given in [12] it follows that simply

w1 =

1728
j(t )

,

w2 =

1728
j(u )

.

this eectively separates variables in the pf equations, and one nds

the fundamental period 0 of the k3 must therefore satisfy lw10 = lw2 0 = 0,

and hence it must have the form 0 = 0e0, where 0 is given by the fundamental

series solution of (2.12):

0(w) = 2f1(cid:16) 1

using (2.10) and the identity [15]

[j(t )  j(u )]24(u )

.

(2.16)

this coincides exactly with the known [21,12] expression for f{2}t t t (t, u ).

summarizing, we have shown how the perturbative component of the quantum
prepotential can be obtained directly from the k3 picard-fuchs equations with prop-
erly chosen sources, and these sources are simply derivatives of the k3 periods.

we now briey indicate how to reverse this process, and in the next section we
will use this method to construct dierential equations whose solutions lead to the
other f{n}(t, u ).

it turns out that the strongest single constraint on the form of the dierential
operators comes from the explicit form of the dilaton, which is essentially the dierence

 this identity is straightforward and is simply the result of a the change of variables (2.10).

 7 

(at large s) between the solution 00 and the manifestly modular invariant quantity
log(y). since the dilaton is non-singular at t = u , this solution must have the form

00 = 2i f{2}t u  log(j(t )  j(u )) .

(2.17)

the general idea is to rst obtain a dierential equation for f{2}t u , by inserting it into
the identity (2.15) with w = w1(t ). the right-hand side of this equation, which
represents the source part, is then given by (1/e4(t ))(u f{2}t t t )0, which can be
evaluated by using the known expression (2.16) for f{2}t t t (t, u ). after subtracting
the logarithmic singularity, this leads precisely to the source term on the rhs of the
picard-fuchs system (2.14).

3. generalizations

assuming that the picard-fuchs equations we seek for n = 4 generalize the struc-
ture we found above, we will try to construct dierential equations for f{n}
t n/2u n/2 (t, u )
by applying the simple procedure outlined earlier. however, before doing that, we will
rst discuss some general features of the homogenous pf equations for arbitrary n.

3.1. symmetric powers of picard-fuchs operators

crucial to our arguments will be the following sequence of dierential operators:

where l1
w  lw is identical to the hypergeometric operator in (2.12). the (m + 1)th
order operator lm
w is what is called the mth symmetric power of the basic operator
lw, the reason being that its solution space is the mth symmetric product of the
solution space of lw. the notion of symmetric powers of dierential operators has
been discussed in the mathematical literature, e.g. in [22] and in [23,24], where also
a systematic procedure for computing them has been described.

 8 

more explicitly, while the fundamental solutions to lwi(w) = 0 are given by

the periods

0(w) = 2f1(cid:16) 1

; 1, w(cid:17) = (e4)1/4 , 1(w) = t 0 = t (e4)1/4 ,

k (w) = kj ji i = t k (e4)3/4 ,

j = 0, 1, 2

i, j, k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ,

(3.3)

and so on. moreover, we nd that these operators satisfy certain identities when
ltered through the mirror map, w = 1728/j(t ): for any function f (z) one has

w l1 (f (w)0(w)) =

w l2 (f (w)0(w)2) =

3 ,

etc.

these identities will prove important momentarily.

3.2. determination of the source terms

note that the prepotentials (1.2) have the property that n+1

f{n}(t, u ) is a good
modular function of weights (n + 2, n) in (t, u ), and must have a simple pole at
t = u (which reects gauge symmetry enhancement to su (2)). from this one can
deduce the functional form. for example, one has:

t

3
t f{2}(t, u ) =

5
t f{4}(t, u ) =

7
t f{6}(t, u ) =

e4(t ) e4(u )e6(u )

[j(t )  j(u )] 24(u )

e6(t ) e2

[j(t )  j(u )] 24(u )

e2

4 (t ) e6(u )

[j(t )  j(u )] 24(u )

,

,

,

etc.

(3.5)

suppose we set w = w1 in (3.4), and take the f to be m
u f{2m}(t, u ). the right-
hand side of the mth equation in (3.4) can then be rewritten using m u -derivatives of
the mth identity in (3.5). the resulting right-hand side is completely modular of t ,

t m

 9 

and almost modular in u . indeed, the right-hand side is mth order in e2(u ). these
factors of e2 may be traded for derivatives of the fundamental periods as follows: one

rst notes that the fundamental periods of the various pf systems can be written as
0  e4(u )m/4. therefore, one can
m

express the w2-derivatives of the periods in terms of u derivatives to obtain:

more generally, (w2)p em

0 may be written in terms of a polynomial of degree p in
e2(u ). conversely, a polynomial of degree p in e2(u ) may be expressed as a linear
dierential operator of order p in w2, acting on m
0 . in this way, one can use (3.5)
and (3.4) to determine the right-hand sides of l(n/2)
resulting expressions have poles in (w1  w2) of orders up to (n/2 + 1). to arrive at a

3.3. explicit results for n = 4

by following the steps described above, we nd for n = 4 (which corresponds to

the eight-dimensional compactication) that

{4}00 = 2i(f{4}t t uu + 3f{2}t u )  2 log(w1  w2) ,

along with the corresponding equation for l2

having now obtained equations for the fundamental inhomogenous solution
2 on the right-

in a manner completely analogous to

{4}00 , we can now investigate the full set of solutions {4}jk , for which 0
hand side of (3.8) or (3.9) is replaced by t ju k0
partial derivatives of f{4} are related to {4}jk
(2.7). explicitly, abbreviating   {4}, one has:

01  u 00 = 6i (f{2}t + f{4}t t u )
10  t 00 = 6i (f{2}u + f{4}t uu )
02  2u 01 + u 200 = 24i f{4}t t
20  2t 10 + t 200 = 24i f{4}uu
11  u 10  t 01 + t u 00 = 6i (f{2} + 3f{4}t u )
(12  2u 11 + u 210)  t (02  2u 01 + u 200) = 72i f{4}t
(21  2t 11 + t 201)  u (20  2t 10 + t 200) = 72i f{4}u

,

(3.10)

 11 

and in particular:

216i f{4}(t, u ) = (22  2u 21 + u 220)  2t (12  2u 11 + u 210)+

t 2(02  2u 01 + u 200) .

(3.11)

one can prove these relations by rst dierentiating both sides suciently often
with respect to t until the left-hand side can be simplied using (3.4) combined with
the dierential equations satised by the {4}jk , while the right-hand side is simplied
using (3.5). this process is then repeated for the u -derivatives of the (3.10). the suc-
cess of this procedure critically depends on the proper form of the (3.8) and provides
a signicant number of non-trivial tests upon the form of (3.8).

3.4. periods of a five-fold?

eq. (3.11) is a direct analog of the classic special geometry relation (2.8), and
reects how the periods of the suspected ve-fold would assemble into the prepotential.
it thus appears as a good starting point for unraveling the analog of special geometry
in eight dimensions.

in this context, it is instructive to go one step further and try to infer how
(3.9) and the prepotential f{4}(t, u ) could arise from a pf system of a 5-fold and
a corresponding prepotential f (s, t, u ), respectively. recall that for f{2}(t, u ) and
the 3-fold the periods are 0, s0, t 0, u 0 and fs0, ft 0, fu 0, f00, and in the
s   limit 0, t 0, u 0 and fs0 become the periods of the k3 ber, while the
nite parts of ft 0, fu 0 and f00 satisfy the k3 pf system with sources, and give
rise to f{2}(t, u ) and its rst derivatives.

based upon this, and remembering the structure (3.7) of the homogenous solu-
tions, we conjecture (in line with the ndings of [15]) that the 5-fold is the hyper-
kahler 4-fold sym2(k3) bered over a ip1 base. as mentioned above, the periods of
the ber are t ju k0
2, j, k = 0, 1, 2, and these arise in the 5-fold as the s   limit
of 0, s0, t 0, u 0 and f{4}s 0, f{4}st 0, f{4}su 0, f{4}st t 0, f{4}st u 0, f{4}suu 0. thus
only the ber periods that are linear in t and u are realized directly. from (3.10)
it appears that only the derivatives f{4}t t u , f{4}t uu , and by extension f{4}st t 0, f{4}st u 0
and f{4}suu 0 will actually appear directly as 5-fold periods. moreover, as with
f{2}0
, lower order derivatives of f{4} will appear in the periods as combinations
2 u (f{2}t + f{4}t t u ). the proper combinations are inferred from how the
like f{4}t t + 1
source equations arise in the s   limit of the 3-fold, and based upon this we

 12 

expect that the combinations that would arise from a 5-fold will be those of the form
{4}jk  t ju k{4}00 .

we could not explicitly verify this conjecture, simply because there is no known
algebraic representation of sym2(k3), and even less, of the relevant ip1 bration of
it. an algebraic or toric representation would however be necessary for obtaining the
picard-fuchs system. the closest one seems to be able to get at, is the beautiful
construction of beauville and donagi [25], which leads to the periods and picard-
fuchs equations of the holomorphic (2, 0)-form of sym2(k3). unfortunately, there
does not seem to be any simple way to obtain from this the periods of the (5, 0)-form
of the ip1 bration.

in the absence of such explicit algebraic representations, we can thus far only
conclude that our results provide further evidence for the conjectured ve-fold, aug-
menting the ndings of ref. [15]. summarizing, our main results supporting this
structure are: a) the form (3.7) of the homogenous solutions, which correspond to
a bration of sym2(k3), and b) the writing (3.11) of the prepotential f{4}(t, u ) in
terms of the inhomogenous solutions of the pf equations.

4. some remarks on curve counting

in the compactication to four dimensions sending s   corresponds to the
large base space limit of the k3 bration. therefore, the coecients c{2} of a2(q) in
(1.3) must correspond to counting certain rational curves in the k3 ber. however,
it is known that other k3 brations lead to dierent counting functions, see, for
example, [26]. moreover, a generic k3 has no rational curves at all. counting rational
curves in k3 thus depends upon how one broadens the concept. by considering
a2(q) = e4e6/24 we count the 2-cycles in k3 that become rational curves in our
particular choice of bration over

the most canonical way to count rational curves in k3 was presented in [27],
where one counts certain singular curves that are holomorphic in a given, xed com-
plex structure; the relevant counting function in this instance is simply given by 24.
as was shown in [28], this can be obtained by the trivial bration k3  ip1, where
ip1 corresponds to the twistor family of complex structures in the hyper-kahler k3.
this reasoning does not involve mirror symmetry, and indeed k3  ip1 is not even a
calabi-yau space.

 13 

our point is that it is in eight dimensions where one can compute the counting
function 24 via mirror symmetry. more precisely, in our computation the counting
2/24 (1.4), and the dierence as compared to four dimen-
function was a4(q) = e4
sions is that the e4s can be removed by incorporating the e8  e8 wilson lines ~v
in the prepotential. that is, as mentioned in [9], extending the sum over the e8  e8
lattice one can write

f{4}(t, u, ~v )  x(k,l,~r)>0

~re8e8 ec{4}(kl  ~r 2/2) li5(cid:2)e2i(kt +lu+~r~v )(cid:3) ,
q yl1

(1  ql)24 =: xn1ec{4}(n)qn

(4.1)

(4.2)

where

(q)24 

1

is exactly the counting function of [27,28]. this function is known to count 1/2-bps

states in k3 compactications of the iia theory [19]. here we nd that it also counts

1/2-bps states in f -theory on k3, in line with the arguments in [2] for the heterotic

string in eight dimensions.

thus, what we have been arguing in this paper is, essentially, how to determine
this counting function via the mirror map. while on the one hand k3  ip1 is not a
calabi-yau space, and on the other, non-trivial k3 brations over ip1 do not lead to
24, it appears that the appropriate geometry to obtain (4.2) from mirror symmetry
is a bration of sym2(k3) over ip1.

appendix a. formal extension to n = 6

the mathematical structure of the prepotentials (1.2) can be considered for any
value of n, and for any modular form an(q) of weight n. from the physical point of
view the generalization appears to be purely formal. on the heterotic side we would
be need to start in 2n + 2 dimensions, and consider a toroidal compactication to give
an amplitude (tr (f n)) in 2n-dimensions. of course, there are no such superstrings
for n > 4. however, the situation is reminiscent of anomaly cancellation [29], and is
indeed related to it: the mathematical mechanism is very general, being just based
on modular properties of the elliptic genus, and works in string theories in any
dimension, no matter how pathological their physical meaning.

we demonstrate here that the prepotential (1.2) makes formally sense for n = 6,
even though there is no known consistent string theory whose amplitudes it would
describe. just from modular properties we must have that a6(q) = e6/24 and so
the relevant one-loop amplitudes are of the form:
