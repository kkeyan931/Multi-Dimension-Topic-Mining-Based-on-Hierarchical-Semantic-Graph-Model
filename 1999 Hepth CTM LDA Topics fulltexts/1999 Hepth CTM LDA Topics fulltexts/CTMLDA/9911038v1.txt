preface

when people ask me what i do, or what kind of subjects i study, i have sometimes
ironically answered that i do abstract art. this thesis does not have practical appli-
cations, in the sense that it can tell you how to wash your clothes, make coee, or
help you to calculate numbers that can in turn be measured with some apparatus.
the applications are theoretical  the thesis casts some light on mathematical rela-
tions within a theoretical framework. and the results that are obtained are purely
analytical.

some people demand from physics that it shall be concerned with observable
things. with such a narrow view of the eld this thesis can hardly be called a work
of physics. but at the same time, i would guess that mathematicians would be
horried by the lack of stringency, so calling it a piece of mathematics is no less
dangerous.

it is on this basis that i like to call it abstract art. its value lies in the aesthetics.
one kind of art has an immediate value because of its beauty to the eye or ear, or
because of its direct associations. another kind of art is more indirect.
its value
may require some background information, and lies more in the meaning than in the
sensation. for me the beauty in the abstract art of physics is of this kind, and lies
in the understanding of certain mathematical relations  that in turn are somehow
related to the world we live in.

this aesthetics is my prior motivation for the interest in theoretical physics. i
cannot claim to do what i do because i think it will make the world a better place.
it is beauty more than importance that attracts me.

for people not so fascinated by art and aesthetical values, i want to emphasize that
this concerns only my subjectice motivation. what is actually done, the derivations
and interpretations, shall of course satisfy the standards of reliable science.

acknowledgments

i would like to express my sincere thanks to ulf lindstrom, who gave me this project,
and has been a pleasant collaborator. i also thank my other helpful teachers and fel-
low students both in oslo and during my stay in stockholm.

chapter 1

introduction

the goal of this thesis is twofold. first, it is meant to give a thorough presentation
of two methods for deriving tensionless limits of strings, and the analogue in other
models. second, the applicability of these methods are investigated by explicitly
going through the calculations for a variety of models.

we start by going through some background theory in this introductory chapter
about constrained hamiltonian systems, and dierent symmetry considerations. a
general result concerning the hamiltonian of di invariant theories is derived in
section 1.4.2. then the methods are presented within the general picture, before
the simplest examples are given in chapter 2. in the subsequent chapters we study
d-branes, rigid strings, general relativity and take a brief look on yang-mills and
chern-simons theory. a summary and concluding remarks are nally given in chapter
7.

throughout this thesis we use the standard summation notation aibi pi aibi, and

natural units where c = 1.

1.1 motivations

the question naturally arises of why we should bother with the kind of limits that
we are going to study in this thesis. do not particles have mass, and strings tension?
the question is of course crucial, and worthy of an answer. if we were not able to
give one, the present undertaking would seem like a meaningless activity beyond any
interest apart from the purely academical one.

but those who are anxious can safely relax: there is a motivation. actually,

there are several dierent aspects of these limits that are of interest.

if we start from the action of a mas-
the limits represent physical situations
sive particle and derive the massless limit, we will end up with a theory for massless
particles describing e.g. photons (if we disregard spin and charge). and their exis-
tence at least is without doubt. whether tensionless strings also have direct physical

1

2

1. introduction

applications is not as easy to tell since strings themselves are not yet suciently well
understood.

but if we want to test the existence of tensionless strings (or analogous limits of
other theories) we need to have a theory for them. and the methods we will use are
ways to arrive at such theories.

high energy limit for high energies the mass of a particle becomes unimportant
compared to its kinetic energy. therefore the massless limit gives an approximation
of the behaviour at high energies. the same is supposed to be true for strings: the
tensionless limit may be viewed as a high energy limit. and high energy physics
is important for several reasons. when we study systems at a very small scale we
unavoidably (by the heisenberg principle) have systems at high energy. also, at the
earliest stages of the evolution of the universe, the energy density was very high. an
understanding of the childhood of the universe thus requires an understanding of
high energy physics.

conformal invariance another characteristic of these limits is that they lead us to
conformally invariant theories. those are theories with a higher degree of symmetry
and interesting in their own right.

and then of course we still have the purely academical reason to investigate just for
the investigation in itself. for, who knows, we may nd something interesting and
important. or we may at least get new insight into known theories.

1.2 lagrange and hamilton formalism

when it comes to solving simple problems in classical mechanics, the formulation
by newton is usually the most natural machinery to use. however, for analytical
discussions the formalism developed by 18th century physicists like lagrange and
hamilton has shown much more fruitful. since this formalism will be used exten-
sively throughout this thesis, we begin by giving a short review. a more thorough
introduction is found in textbooks on eld theory, e.g. [14].

1.2.1 lagrange formalism

the starting point in this formalism is the lagrangian density (in the following just
called the lagrangian or lagrange function), which is a function of some elds i(xa)
and their derivatives ai = i
xa ,

l = l(i, ai).

(1.1)

the index i is used, when necessary, to distinguish the dierent elds in the la-
grangian. a is an index running over all coordinates. a = 0 denotes the time coor-
dinate, and we write time derivatives as 0 = . for spatial (a > 0) derivatives

1.2 lagrange and hamilton formalism

3

we write . this convention will be convenient when we work in the hamilton
formalism, since time has a special role there.
the above lagrangian is written as a function of rst order derivatives only, and
hence we call it a rst order lagrangian. it is also possible to allow for higher order
derivatives in the lagrangian, but such lagrangians can usually be reduced to rst
order ones by introduction of extra elds, as discussed in [5].

from the lagrange function we construct the action as the integral over the

conguration space,

s[i] =z dxl(i(x), ai(x)),

(1.2)

where x = {xa} is usually a set of coordinates, and the integral is then many-
dimensional. the action integral is a functional of the elds i(x), which means
that it takes functions to numbers (in contrast to functions, which take numbers to
numbers.) suppose we make small variations in the arguments of the lagrangian. in
other words, consider the transformation i  i + i, with i = 0 on the bound-
aries. the values of i that represent the dynamical behaviour of the classical system
are the ones that leave the action unchanged under such innitesimal variations. this
is the principle of extremal action, also called hamiltons principle.

if we consider a variation i in the elds, and demand the action to be extremal
(i.e. zero under the transformation), we arrive at some equations which we call the
eld equations, equations of motion or euler-lagrange equations. for lagrangians
that have only rst order derivatives, they can be deduced quite simply as follows.

i  s =z dx(cid:18) l

i i +

l

(ai)

(ai)(cid:19) .

(1.3)

we can change the order of variation and derivation and write (ai) = a(i).
together with a partial integration this gives

s = z dx(cid:18) l
= z dx(cid:18) l

i i + a(

i  a(

(ai)

l

(ai)
l

i)  a(
)(cid:19) i,

l

(ai)

)i(cid:19)

(1.4)

where we have disregarded the total derivative. this is allowed since it will only give
rise to a boundary (surface) term that vanishes since i are then zero. demanding
s = 0 for arbitrary innitesimal variations i we nd the eld equations,

i  a(

l

(ai)

l
i = 0.

) 

(1.5)

the elds that satisfy the equations of motion are said to span the classical path.

as long as we are in the classical domain of physics, the action integral is just a
convenient and compact notation that contains the eld equations and the symmetries
of the theory. the introduction of this formalism is, however, crucial when we want to
do quantum mechanics. classically, two actions that gives rise to the same equations

4

1. introduction

of motion are equivalent, but this is not true quantum mechanically. classically
equivalent actions normally lead to dierent quantum physics. this fact may serve
as a justication of our eagerness to nd classically equivalent actions.

one of the major advantages of this formalism is that many symmetries are
manifest in the lagrangian. and this is also of great help when we want to write
down the lagrange function in the rst place: it must have a form that satises the
symmetries of the theory under consideration.

there is generally no way to deduce the lagrangian. but that is no weakness of
the formalism. any theory needs a starting point, and in this formalism we start with
the lagrangian, and take the extremum of the action as a rst principle. the right
attitude is not to try to derive a lagrangian, but to argue from general principles
(e.g. symmetry) and analogies with other theories that it should take some specic
form.

variational derivatives

consider a function f constructed from some elds i(x) and their rst order deriva-
tives, f = f (, ). (the typical example is the lagrangian.) variations in i(x)
will then give a variation in f (x) that we can write

(x)  f (x) = z dx(cid:20) f (x)

i(x)  a
f (x)
i(x).
i(x)

 z dx

f (x)

(ai(x))(cid:21) i(x)

(1.6)

(1.7)

the variational derivative f (x)
i(x) of f gives the contribution to the variation of f (x)
from a variation of i(x). to get the total variation of f (x) we have to sum over the
discrete index i, and integrate over the continuous parameter x.

by comparison with (1.4) we see that the euler-lagrange equations can be written

by means of the variational derivative as

l
i = 0.

(1.8)

1.2.2 hamilton formalism

if we already have the lagrangian, we dene the canonical conjugate momentum
(density) associated with i as

i =

l
 i

,

(1.9)

where, again, dot denotes dierentiation with respect to the time parameter.

with the denition (1.9) we can perform a legendre transformation from cong-

uration space to phase space. first, dene the quantity h by

h(, , ) = i i  l(, ).

(1.10)

1.2 lagrange and hamilton formalism

5

a variation in h can then be written

h = i i + ii 

l
i i 

l
 i

 i 

l

i i.

substitute for the denition of  and arrive at

h = ii 

l
i i 

l

i i.

the variation h can be written by means of variations in ,  and . this means
that we can express h =    l as a function of these variables, omitting . this is
true even though (1.9) may not always be possible to solve explicitly for i. written
this way we call h the hamiltonian, but now denoted with a capital h,

h = h(, ,) = i i  l(, )

(1.11)

the transformation from l to h is a legendre transformation. we will call the
hamiltonian obtained in this way the naive hamiltonian, hnaive, to distinguish it
from the total hamiltonian which we introduce in the next section.

hamiltons modied principle states that the phase space action,

sp s =z dx(i i  h(, ,)),

(1.12)

is unchanged under variations of  and , which are now considered independent of
each other. we nd1

sp s = z dx(cid:20)z dx(x  x)(cid:16) i(x)i(x)  i(x)(x)(cid:17)
i(x)(cid:17)(cid:21)

h(x)
i(x)

i(x) +

i(x)

z dx(cid:16) h(x)
= z dx(cid:20)(cid:16) i(x) z dx
+(cid:16)  i(x) z dx

h(x)

i(x)(cid:17)i(x)
i(x)(cid:17)i(x)(cid:21).

h(x)

(1.13)

using hamiltons modied principle sp s = 0, this leads to hamiltons equations:

i(x) = z dx h(x)
 i(x) = z dx h(x)

i(x)

i(x)

,

.

(1.14)

(1.15)

these equations are equivalent to the euler-lagrange equations. this is not trivial
to prove, and it is a remarkable result that it is true.

1 we use a trick and write i(x)i(x) =r dx(x  x) i(x)i(x) (and the same for i(x)i(x)).

6

1. introduction

1.2.3 constrained systems

references for the theory discussed in this section are [68].

suppose that we for a given lagrangian have found the momenta i = l

 i . the
way to the hamiltonian picture is easy if we can invert this procedure to nd i as
i = i(, ,). then we can just sub-
functions of the elds and momenta, i.e.
stitute for i in h and immediately arrive at the naive hamiltonian hnaive(, ,)
this is often possible, but not if there exists some gauge freedom in the theory. there
are also non-gauge theories which fail to be invertible in this way [7].

it is therefore of interest to study this class of systems, which are called con-
strained systems. the non-invertibility means that the derived momenta will not be
independent, and there exist some relations between them. these relations can be
expressed as functions i
m(, ,) = 0, m = 1, . . . , m , where m is the number of
such functions. we call these the primary constraints since they follow directly from
the denition of the momenta.

suppose that i can take n dierent values (i.e. there are n eld variables). then
 i j . if r is the rank of this matrix, then the number

dene the n n matrix cij  2l
of independent primary constraints is n  r.
for constrained systems the naive hamiltonian is not unique, since we may add
to it any linear combination of the constraint functions i. this fact leads to a
modication of hamiltons equations. the modied versions are

i(x) = z dx h1(x)
 i(x) = z dx h1(x)

i(x)

i(x)

,

(1.16)

(1.17)

i i
where h1  hnaive + m
m and m
they are called lagrange multipliers.

i are coecients that do not depend on  and .

poisson brackets the notation of poisson brackets is very convenient in this for-
malism. consider two functions f and g that are constructed from  and . if we
write f (x) as short for f ((x), (x)), their poisson bracket is dened as

(cid:8)f (x), g(x)(cid:9) z dx(cid:18) f (x)

i(x)

g(x)
i(x) 

f (x)
i(x)

g(x)

i(x)(cid:19) .

(1.18)

the brackets can easily be shown to satisfy the following relations:

1. antisymmetry {f, g} = {g, f}
2. linearity {f + g, h} = {f, h} + {g, h}
3. product law {f g, h} = f{g, h} + {f, h}g
4. the jacobi identity {f,{g, h}} + {g,{h, f}} + {h,{f, g}} = 0

1.2 lagrange and hamilton formalism

7

it is also easy to show that the fundamental poisson brackets are

{i(x), j (x)} = i
{i(x), j (x)} = {i(x), j (x)} = 0.

j(x  x),

(1.19)

(1.20)

when we work with poisson brackets in the present circumstance the following is
important: poisson brackets must be evaluated before we make use of the constraint
equations. in other words, we should perform the calculations in phase space, and
restrict to the constraint surface ( = 0) at the end. to emphasize this point we use
diracs notation [6] and say that the constraint equations are weakly zero, and write
them with a new weak equality sign  as:

i
m(, )  0.

(1.21)

this makes a dierence, for even though (, ) is dynamically zero (i.e. zero when
 and  satisfy hamiltons equations) it is not zero throughout phase space.

now, let us consider the time evolution of the function f (, ). by the chain rule we
have

f (x) =z dx(cid:18) f (x)

i(x)

i(x) +

f (x)
i(x)

i(x)(cid:19) .

(1.22)

using the (modied) hamiltons equations (1.16) and (1.17) we can insert for  and
 and get

f (x) = z dxz dx(cid:18) f (x)
= z dx(cid:8)f (x), h1(x)(cid:9) .

i(x)

h1(x)
i(x) 

f (x)
i(x)

h1(x)

i(x) (cid:19)

(1.23)

the constraints must hold (i.e. be weakly equal to zero) for all times. this means
that their time derivatives should vanish (weakly):

i
m(, )  0.

(1.24)

by putting f = i
conditions:

m in the equation above, we thus get the following consistency

z dx{i

m(x), h1(x)}  0,

or more explicitly

z dxh{i

m(x), hnaive(x)} + n

i {i

m(x), i

n(x)}i  0.

these equations may lead to three dierent situations. the rst is that they do not
give anything new at all, we merely end up with 0 = 0. in this case we have already
found the full constraint structure.

(1.25)

(1.26)

8

1. introduction

another possibility is that we arrive at equations not involving the i s. then

we get new constraints on  and  on the form

ii
p (, )  0.

(1.27)

these are called secondary constraints.

on them,
should be continued until we get no more new conditions.

the third kind of equations we may end up with also depend on the lagrange
multipliers i . the consistency conditions will then impose a condition on the i s.
if we get secondary constraints we must go on and check the consistency conditions
ii  0 in just the same way as for the primary constraints. this loop
the distinction between primary and secondary (and tertiary etc.) constraints is
just a matter of how they appear, and is not physically important. in fact, dierent
lagrangians that describe the same physical system will in general give rise to the
constraints in a dierent order and dierent combinations.

when we have found all constraints and conditions on the s (if any) we are

ready to write down the total hamiltonian:

ht = h + aa.

(1.28)

if we had no conditions imposed on the s, h will be identical to the naive hamil-
tonian, and a = {m
ii , . . .}. if, on the other hand, such conditions were present,
h will be shifted by some factor, and the lagrange multipliers can be redened so
that all the as are independent. this will not be important for our considerations,
and is explained in more detail in [6, 7].

several examples of calculations of the kind explained in this section are given

later on in the thesis.

1.3 symmetries

let s be some symmetry, and let ts be the transformation associated with this
symmetry. we say that a theory has the symmetry s if the action s = r ldx
describing the theory is left unchanged under transformations ts . we then say that
in this section we will see a brief description of some
the action is s-invariant.
symmetries that we will frequently encounter. most of the examples presented are
studied in more detail later on.

1.3.1 dieomorphism symmetry

suppose we have an action integral parameterized by x (x may be one parameter or
a whole set), then we write the action as

s =z dxl(),

(1.29)

1.3 symmetries

where  symbolizes the eld variables. ( may be one or a whole set of elds.) a
dieomorphism is a general coordinate transformation of the form

x  x = x(x).

(1.30)

the name comes from the fact that x is a dierentiable function of x (usually  c).
in the context of particles, strings etc. where the parameters in the action are not the
spacetime coordinates we usually refer to the transformation as a reparameterization.
now, for a dieomorphism symmetry to be present in the model, the action has to
be invariant under this transformation. whether that is the case of course depends
on how the elds transform, (x)  (x), and of the form of the lagrangian. for
short, dieomorphism is often written di (e.g. di invariance).

example: the relativistic point particle. here the action is (c.f. section 2.2)

s = mz ds

dx 
d

dx 
d

(1.31)

consider the reparameterization    ( ). the elds are scalars under this transfor-
mation, in the sense that x ( ) = x ( ). (the position of the particle is obviously
independent of the parameterization.) the transformed action (i.e. the action de-
scribed by the transformed quantities) is then

d x ( )

(1.32)

the symbolic form of the action is unchanged, which is precicely the symmetry
criterion.

1.3.2 weyl symmetry

when we talk about weyl symmetry we study theories which involve some metric
gab. a weyl transformation is then a position-dependent rescaling of this metric.
(we could also imagine rescalings of other elds, but they are not so interesting.)
the transformation can be written as

gab(x)  gab(x) = e(x)gab(x),

(1.33)

where (x) is any function. an action that is unchanged by this transformation is
consequently called weyl invariant.

10

1. introduction

example: the weyl-invariant string action [9, 10]:

s =z d2ggabab.

(1.34)

here ab  g ax bx  , where g is the background (xed) spacetime metric,
and a  
a . the eld variables in the theory are the intrinsic worldsheet metric
components gab() and the position eld x (). consider then the weyl transforma-
tion gab()  e()gab(). under this rescaling of the metric we will have

g  det gab  e2g

gab  egab.

and the action will transform as

s z d2qe2gegabab = s.

(1.35)

so the action is worldsheet weyl invariant (as its name correctly announces). note
also that the dimensionality d = 2 enters crucially in this derivation.

1.3.3 poincare symmetry

a poincare transformation is a coordinate transformation that consists of the familiar
lorentz transformation plus translation. it is also called an inhomogeneous lorentz
transformation, a name which is obvious from the form:

x   x = 

 x  + a.

(1.36)

 are the lorentz transformation coecients and a are constants describing the


translational part.

lorentz transformations can further be split into into boosts and rotations in

addition to the discrete transformations of time and space inversion.

a general result worth noting is that lorentz invariance is automatically achieved

if the lagrangian is written in covariant form as a lorentz scalar.

one very interesting feature of the poincare transformation is that gauge theory
based on local poincare invariance (i.e. the coecients in the above transformation
are position dependent), gives rise to a theory for gravitation.

example: the relativistic point particle.

we start again from the action (1.31). the coecients 

 and a are constants,

so the derivatives of x  are transformed as

x  

dx 
d  



x  .

this is the only quantity that is changed under the poincare transformation, so the
action will transform as

s  z dq

= z dq x  x  = s,

tivistic point particle action has poincare symmetry.

 

. thus, we see that the rela-

1.3.4 conformal symmetry

a conformal transformation is a mapping from at space (minkowski or euclidian)
onto itself, such that the at metric ab is left invariant up to a rescaling. in other
words, it has the same eect as the substitution ab  (x)ab for some positive
denite function (x). because of this, the line element will transform as ds2 
ds2, showing that the causal structure is conserved. in particular, light cones will
transform into light cones.

alternatively, the conformal transformation may be viewed as a composite di
and weyl transformation that leaves the at metric invariant. (the conformal sym-
metry group is a subgroup of the diweyl symmetry group.)
named conformal transformation. but they are not to be considered as the same.

in general relativity terminology, what is here called weyl transformation is often

it is also important not to confuse conformal symmetry with the di invariance
of general relativity. conformal symmetry is a symmetry in at space theory, with
no independent metric elds to vary. hence, conformal transformations in general
actually change the distances between points. from this it follows that conformally
symmetric theories have no length scale.

a full conformal transformation involves a poincare transformation (lorentz +
translation), a dilatation and a special conformal transformation.
it acts on the
spacetime coordinates, and the innitesimal transformation can be written x 
x = x + x, with

lorentz:

translation:

dilatation:

special conformal:

 x,

x = 
ax = a,
cx = cx,
bx = b xx

xxb.

(1.37)

(1.38)

(1.39)

(1.40)

in 4 dimensions there are 15 independent parameters of this symmetry group: 6
lorentz ( = ); 4 translations (a); 1 dilatation (c); 4 special (b).
example: the massless scalar eld.

consider the action

s =z dx .

(1.41)

12

1. introduction

since  is a scalar we have

(x) = (x);

 (x) =

x
 x (x) = (

   x)(x),

(1.42)

where   

 x . the transformed action can then be written as

s = z dx    
 x
x )(

= z dx det(

  x)(

   x) .

(1.43)

(1.44)

the jacobi determinant is to rst order det(  x

x ) = 1 + x. this gives

s = s + s;

s =z dxx  ,
x   x +  x + x .

let us now consider the conformal transformations one by one.

lorentz consider rst the lorentz transformation x = 

x. we nd then
x = 
, which together with the antisymmetry of  gives x  = 0. so the
action is lorentz invariant. as mentioned earlier, this could be concluded solely from
the fact that the lagrangian is written covariantly as a lorentz scalar.

translation for translations we have x = a, which gives  x = 0 and

immediately x  = 0. thus the action is always poincare invariant.

x  =  c(

dilatation turn then to the dilatation, x = cx. we nd x = c

, and
  2) which is zero in two dimensions (d = 2). for general spacetime
dimensions d, we get s = r dx , with  = 1 + c(d  2)  1 > 0. thus

we nd that the eect of a dilatation is the same as a rescaling of the metric.

 xb. this gives x  =  b x(

special conformal special conformal transformations have x = bxx 
  2),
in general we nd s = r dx  , with

2 xxb, which gives x = bx + b x
which is again zero for d = 2.
 = 1 + b  x(d  2)  1 > 0.
we have now seen explicitly that a conformal transformation on the massless scalar
eld has the eect of a rescaling of the at metric (   ( + ), with  and
 as dened above). furthermore, we found that it is conformal invariant in two
dimensions.

1.4 more on coordinate transformations

in this section we will use symmetry principles to derive some important general
results in eld theory.

consider a general action integral,

s =z dxl(i, i),

(1.45)

where i are some general elds; scalars, vectors or whatever. we have assumed that
there is no explicit coordinate dependence. in the following we will see what happens
if we make the coordinate transformation,

xa  xa = xa + aa,

(1.46)

where aa = aa(x) is innitesimal. we now dene the jacobi matrix j a
determinant j as

b and the jacobi

xa
 xb = a

j a
b 
j  det(j a

b  baa,
b ) = det(a

b  baa) = 1  cac.

whit this denition the integral measure transforms as dx  dx = dxj1.

under the transformation (1.46) the action will transform to

s  s =z dxl( (x),  (x)).

let the transformation of the elds be written

i(x)  i(x) = i(x) + i(x)

(1.47)

(1.48)

(1.49)

(1.50)

this denes i. note that the elds are taken at dierent points on the left and
right hand side. this is not the usual way to compare elds, but convenient for the
moment. the notation, and the subsequent calculation, is inspired by fryland [1].
for scalars we have  = 0.

the derivatives of the elds will transform as

b

i(x) =

xc
 xb c(i(x) + i)

= bi(x) + bi(x)  bacc(x).

(1.51)

the transformed action integral may now be taylor expanded and rewritten in the
following way:

s = z dxj1l(i + i, ai + ai  aabbi)

another partial integration gives

s = z dx(at a

(1.53)

(1.54)

in the calculations above we have assumed that aa is position dependent. but consider
now the global transformation (i.e. aa = const), which is an innitesimal translation.
this is usually a symmetry of the action, in which case we have s = 0. equation
(1.54) then gives the condition

at a

b = 0.

(1.55)

in other words, the (global) symmetry leads to a conserved translation current t a
b.
this is a special case of noethers theorem which states that any symmetry implies
a conserved current.

1.4.1 energy-momentum tensor

l

the translation current is often called the canonical energy-momentum tensor, and
we dened it as

b = a

t a
however, the tensor t ab = bdt a
d is not symmetric and therefore cannot be used on
the right hand side of einsteins eld equations for general relativity. neither is it
always possible to generalize to curved spacetime.

(1.56)

we will now present another way of dening the energy-momentum tensor, which
avoids these problems. consider the action for general relativity coupled to matter,
which can be written (c.f. chapter 5 and [11])

s =z d4xg(

1


r + lm ),

(1.57)

where  is a constant, g = det(gab) is the determinant of the metric, r is the ricci
curvature scalar and lm is the term describing the matter eld. it is the same as the

1.4 more on coordinate transformations

lagrangian expressed in at spacetime with the at metric exchanged by the general

metric gab. (this is not valid for spinors.) if we dene lm  glm , a variation

gab leads to the eld equations

this tensor is manifestly symmetric, and gives a convenient denition of the energy-
momentum tensor. in the following we will go through the necessary calculations to
prove that the two denitions of the energy-momentum tensor are equivalent in at
spacetime, provided that i couples to gravity via gab.

equivalence of (1.56) and (1.59)
consider again the innitesimal transformation xa  xa + aa(x). the metric gab
transforms as a second rank tensor, i.e.

ad
gab  gab(x) = c

 xa = j c

a 

b gab(x),

a = c

a  aab.

(1.60)

(1.61)

this gives

gab(x) = gab(x) + gab;

gab = (accgab + gacbac + gcbaac).

(1.62)

we recognize gab as a lie derivative. using the results from appendix a.4 we nd

gab = ~agab = aab  baa = (aab).

now, consider the at space action s =r dxl(). coupling to gravity gives

sg =z dxlg(, g); lg = gl(, g).

(1.63)

(1.64)

the innitesimal dieomorphism xa  xa + aa gives a variation in the action, which
we write
(1.65)

sg = sg + gsg.

sg  sg + sg;

the rst term in sg is proportional to  and the second is proportional to gab
since any gravity-coupled action is generally coordinate invariant, i.e. di invariant,
we must have

and as a special result

s = sg + gsg = 0,

(sg + gsg)|g= = 0.

(1.66)

(1.67)

16

1. introduction

if we use equation (1.53) we get

sg|g= = s =z dxaabt a

b =z dxaabt ab

(1.68)

where t ab is the canonical energy-momentum tensor. furthermore, by use of (1.63)
we nd

gsg|g= = z dx
= 2z dx

lg
gab

gab|g= = z dx
lg
gab |g=aab

gab (aab)|g=

equation (1.67) gives then the following relation in at space:

t ab = 2

lg
gab |g= = t ab|g=,

(1.69)

(1.70)

which is exactly what we wanted to show. it says that the two denitions (1.56) and
(1.59) are the same in at spacetime for models that couple to gravity according to
(1.64). since the two denitions are the same, we immediately nd that even the
canonical energy-momentum tensor t ab is symmetric. as noted earlier, this is not a
general result, but comes here as a consequence of the assumpsion (1.64) that i is a
kind of eld that couples to gravity via gab.

energy-momentum tensor for spinors

a description of gravity models with spinors is most easily done in the vielbein
formalism (see appendix a.3). denote the vielbeins e a
a (x) and their determintants
det(e a
lg = el(i, e a
but also tensors.

the lorentz transformation is a symmetry of the theory, so s = 0. furthermore,
if the elds i satisfy the equations of motion lg
which means that the antisymmetic part of the energy-momentum tensor is zero, i.e.
t[ab] = 0. in other words, the energy-momentum tensor is symmetric for elds that
satisfy the equations of motion, but not generally.

i = 0, we get r dxabtab = 0

energy-momentum tensor for conformally invariant theories

as noted in section 1.3.4, a conformal transformation has the same eect as a rescaling
of the metric. thus we may consider the variation of the action s as a result of a
variation in gab with gab = gab. this means that we can write

s =z dx

l
gab

gab =z dx2t abgab = 2z dxt abgab.

(1.73)

invariance means s = 0 so we have for conformally invariant theories that the
energy-momentum tensor is traceless, i.e.

t a

a = t abgab = 0.

(1.74)

this is indeed a simple way to determine conformal invariance.

example: we now return to the massless scalar eld we considered in section 1.3.4,
with the lagrangian

l =  .

(1.75)

the canonical energy-momentum tensor is found to be

t 

  

 l 

l

= (

 

   2

t  = (   2).

to use the other denition of the energy-momentum tensor, we couple the model to
gravity, and get

lg = gg .

then we nd

t

g

lg
g

=

lg

= (g g  2gg).

we see immediately that t  = t |g=. furthermore, the trace is

t 
 = g t  = (d  2)g ,

which says that the energy-momentum tensor is traceless in two dimension, d = 2.
this is in complete agreement with the fact that the massless scalar eld is conformal
invariant in two dimensions.

1.4.2 naive hamiltonian for di invariant theories

if we let a be position dependent, and arbitrary, the transformation (1.46) is identical
to an innitesimal dieomorphism. if we demand the action to be di invariant, but
do not restrict to elds that satisfy the equations of motion, we get from (1.52) the
condition

z dxht a

baab  iii = 0.

(1.80)

we want to show how this can give us an expression for the hamiltonian. to do so
we need to know the form of . let us consider scalar, vector and second rank tensor
elds, i = {, aa, aab}, and dene b
scalars for scalar elds we have simply

a  aab.

a  xb

 xa = b

vectors for vector elds we have

 = 0.

aa(x) = b

aab(x) = (b

a  aab)ab(x),

which gives

a
b = baaaa.

second rank tensors

in this case we have

fab(x) = c

ad

b fcd(x),

which gives

ab = cad(c
f

afdb + c

bfad)

(1.81)

(1.82)

(1.83)

(1.84)

(1.85)

if the action depends on both scalars, vectors and second rank tensors, their contri-
butions will just add up. the di symmetry criterion is then

z dxaabht a

b + aab + acfbc + dafdci = 0,

(1.86)

where a are the euler-lagrange equations associated with aa and ab are the euler-
lagrange equations associated with fab. for the equation to be true for arbitrary aa
we must have

t a
b = aab  acfbc  dafdc.
furthermore, we recognize t 0
0 as the naive hamiltonian with opposite sign. in other
words we have

(1.87)

h = t 0

0 = 0a0 + 0cf0c + d0fd0

(1.88)

we get the hamiltonian hnaive by elimination of time derivatives in favour of mo-
menta in the expression for h. immediately, we see that if the action depends only
on scalar elds, the hamiltonian will be zero. this is an important result that we
can state as a theorem:

1.5 methods

19

theorem 1 dieomorphism invariant theories with lagrangians that depend on
scalar-transforming elds and their rst derivatives have vanishing (naive) hamil-
tonian.

the same result has been proved by von unge in [12].

the signicance of the more general result (1.88) is perhaps not obvious. for the case
of scalar elds it is of course simple and easily applicable. if we also have vectors or
higher rank tensors, (1.88) gives certainly not any simpler route for a calculation of
the hamiltonian than its denition itself. on the other hand, it allows us to make an
interesting interpretation. observe that the hamiltonian is proportional to the s,
which by the equations of motions (euler-lagrange equations) are zero. this means
that at any point on the classical path the hamiltonian will be zero, since the s
are then zero. in this sense the we say that the hamiltonian is dynamically zero.

theorem 2 dieomorphism invariant theories with a lagrangian that depends only
on tensor elds (of any rank) and their derivatives have a hamiltonian that is dy-
namically zero.

this result is not completely general, since we have still considered only tensor elds.
it is not necessarily true if the lagrangian depends on e.g. spinors. in this thesis,
however, we will consider only elds of the rst kind.

an example that validates the result (1.88) is given in section 2.5.3. there we
will derive the hamiltonian for the polyakov string both directly from its denition,
and using the result in this section.

1.5 methods

the main purpose of this thesis is to describe and apply two methods for deriving
high energy limits of various actions. this section is devoted to a general description
of these methods. the rst is the simplest. it can be applied to any model, although
it does not always lead o any interesting eld equations. the second requires more
calculations, but makes it at the same time possible to derive several limits. the
limit found by the rst method is usually one of these.

the starting point is an action of the form

s = t z dxl(, ),

(1.89)

where t is some dimensionful constant, like mass or string tension.
it is a basic
assumption that we can write the lagrangian as l = tl. the quantity l can be
called the reduced lagrangian, since we have taken out the constant t . this action
is clearly not very suitable for studying the t  0 limit. the philosophy now is to
search for an action that is classically equivalent to (1.89) as long as t 6= 0, but also
well dened for t = 0. we will then treat this new action (with t = 0 inserted) as
a t  0 limit of the original model. the methods described below are systematic
ways for nding such actions.

20

1. introduction

1.5.1 method i: auxiliary eld

this is the simplest approach, and involves the introduction of an auxiliary eld .
a reference for the this method is karlhede and lindstrom [13]. we use the l from
the original action and write

s =

1

2z dx(l2 +

t 2


).

(1.90)

this action is equivalent to (1.90). to show this explicitly, we solve the equations of
motion for :

  s =

=

1

2z dx(l2 
2z dx(l2 

1

t 2
2 )

t 2
2 ).

using hamiltons principle and demanding s = 0 for arbitrary variations  gives

l2 

t 2
2 = 0
t
l

 =

;

if we put this back into (1.90) we get

s =

1

2z dx(

t

ll2 + l

t

when t 6= 0.

(1.91)

t 2) = t z dxl = s.

thus the two actions s and s are equivalent for t 6= 0. in addition s allows us to
take the t  0 limit simply by setting t = 0 in the action. this gives

st =0

 =

1

2z dxl2.

(1.92)

you may ask what this new eld  really is. from the current point of view we
cannot say anything more than we already have  that it helps us in our calculations.
hence the name auxiliary eld.

note however, that in the simplest case of a massless particle in section 2.2.2 we

are lead to interpret  as the einbein.

a general remark on symmetry properties can already be made. consider dieo-
morphism invariance. we know that the integral measure transforms as dx  dxj1,
where j is the jacobi determinant as dened by equation (1.48). if the original action
is to be di invariant, the lagrangian must transform as a density, i.e. l  jl. we
see then that s is also di invariant if we demand  to be an inverse density (i.e.
scalar density of weight 1, c.f. appendix a.1). and since  was introduced as an
auxiliary eld with no a priori physical interpretation, this transformation property
is something we can impose on .

1.5 methods

dynamics

21

a variation of  gives one equation of motion,

 

l2 = 0  l = 0.

(1.93)

the eect of a variation in i, on the other hand, depends on the form of l:

the eld equation is found from demanding s = 0 for arbitrary i. the result is

(ai)(cid:19) = 0.

often, this equation will reduce to an identity by use of equation (1.93), l = 0. but
it does give non-trivial equations in cases where li  1

the factors l are eliminated from equation (1.94).) however, this is not the general
situation, so method i has limited applicability.

1.5.2 method ii: phase space

this method of arriving at an action that admits taking the t  0 limit is designed
for constrained systems. demonstrations of the method can be found in [8, 1318],
but also later in this thesis. again we start from the action (1.89). we derive the

the derivations of the total hamiltonian h involves working out the constraint struc-

t = 0, these can be simplied by putting t = 0 as early as possible.

now, having found the total hamiltonian, we write down the phase space action

sp s =z dx(cid:16)i

i  h(, ,)(cid:17) .

(1.97)

the momenta i can then be eliminated by solving their equations of motion. (this
is often called integrating out the momenta, a notation which is natural in the

by literary integrating out the momenta from the functional integral.) substituting
for the solutions of i, we arrive at the conguration space action

scs =z dxh(, )   h(, (, ),)i .

(1.98)

unless the system under study is non-constrained (giving h = hnaive) this action
will contain something new compared to the one we started with. in other words,
it is dierent from the original conguration space action, but still equivalent (see
gure 1.1) to it. hopefully the new aspects make it possible to take the t  0 limit.
what is new are the lagrange multipliers, which are now independent elds. as
discussed later, these may often be reinterpreted as components of some metric, or
as (degenerated) vielbeins.

in cases where there are no constraints imposed from the denition of the mo-
mentum, the calculations above will give only a circle where we end up at the point
we started. however, it will show possible (c.f. 2.5) via some redenitions in phase
space to allow for the t  0 limit in a sensible way. this situation is better discussed
when it appears.

bosonic strings

2.1

introduction to strings and branes

short history of strings

strings originated in the late sixties as a model describing strong interactions [19].
quarks are known always to exist in bound states, and the string approach was a
proposal for explaining this quark connement. very simplied, the picture was that
of quarks attached to strings.

this theory was pushed aside by the successful qcd (quantum chromo-dynamics)
theory. but in 1974, scherk and schwarz [20] made the remarkable suggestion that
string theory was a correct mathematical theory of a dierent problem, the unication
of elementary particle interactions with gravity.

after this the theory attained much attention, but had no real breakthrough.
many properties made it attractive, but the problems were too serious. however,
with the introduction of supersymmetry (a symmetry between bosons and fermions)
into the superstring theory [2123] (in contrast to the old bosonic string theory), a
lot of the problems disappeared. and this is the theory that has attracted enormous
attention over the last fteen years. in these years there have appeared dierent types
of superstring theories, but they are now thought to be limits of one fundamental
theory, which is called m-theory (or matrix theory), and is for the moment under
constant investigation.

string theory

strings are one-dimensional objects with a length of the order of the planck length,
1034m. they are free to vibrate, much like ordinary guitar strings. the possible
modes of vibration are determined by the string tension, which is the only funda-
mental parameter in string theory.

we know that at larger scales the strings must behave as particles with certain
masses. the model is that the dierent vibration modes of the one fundamental
string, give rise to the whole zoo of particles we know from elementary particle

23

24

2. bosonic strings

physics. dierent vibration modes mean dierent frequencies or energies, and hence,
dierent masses of the particles. thus, in principle, string theory could be used to
derive the mass spectrum of all particles. this is one of the ultimate goals, but is in
practice very dicult.

as was mentioned above, this theory is a promising candidate for a unication
of quantum eld theory (elementary particle physics) and general relativity (gravita-
tion). actually, string theory is not consistent without gravity. this aspect of string
theory is probably the most important, but there are also other sides that make such
a large number of theoretical physicists talk warmly about it.

another of its advantages is that it avoids altogether the divergences that un-
avoidably appear in quantum eld theories. this is due to the fact that strings are
not pointlike, but have extension in space. also in contrast to quantum eld theo-
ries, string theory involves no arbitrary choice of gauge symmetry group and choice
of representation: string theory is essentially unique.

the last comment is an example of a general attractive feature of string theory,
namely that there is very little freedom. once the basic theory is formulated, im-
portant results follow directly or by consistency. the spacetime dimension is also
xed in this way. superstring theory is consistent only with 10 (1 + 9) spacetime
dimensions. (for bosonic strings there must be 26 dimensions.) at rst this may
sound like a catastrophe, since we know by everyday experience that the world is
4-dimensional (1 + 3). the way to handle this diculty, is to say that the extra 6
dimensions are compactied, or curled up so that they play no role at large scales.
this is very much an ad hoc assumption, but at least string theory gives a way to
understand the spacetime dimensionality.

in this thesis we will not consider the supersymmetric string theory (superstrings),
but only dierent models for bosonic strings. bosonic string theory does not have
fermions, and is not a realistic theory. however, it is a good starting point, and gives
insight in crucial aspects of the more realistic models as well.

what is real?

to be or not to be, that is the question. hamlet certainly had other things than
elementary particle physics in mind, but his question is indeed fundamental for our
discussion as well: do strings really exist, or do they not? and are strings the
fundamental building blocks of the universe?

the traditional view is that the world is built up of pointlike particles. these are
things with certain properties like mass and spin, but without extension in space.
in other words, they are thought to be zero-dimensional. string theory changes this
view only insofar as the strings are not points, but have extension in one dimension,
i.e. are one-dimensional.

with such views we are immediately faced with the question of model versus
reality.
is our model only a mathematical construction that by coincidence hap-
pens to resemble the physical reality, or does the success of the model give a deeper
understanding of reality itself?

2.2 the point particle

25

to meet this question, we must know what we mean by reality. what does it
actually mean that something is real? one answer to this is to say that the real
world is the observable world. this description works quite well in everyday life.
however, when it comes to elementary particles, the task of observing becomes very
dicult. for instance, our understanding of shape is useless at such small scales. the
quantum theory of physics, with its schrodinger equation and heisenberg relation,
leads us to view the elementary particles as rather diuse objects that are somehow
smeared out in spacetime.

returning then to the question of the being of the fundamental building blocks,
one possible answer is to say that they are neither particles nor strings. but they
behave at very small scales as strings, and at larger scales as points. and someone
has also said that you are what you do.

branes

as we have accepted the leap from points to strings, it is natural to go further
and consider even higher-dimensional objects. perhaps the fundamental objects are
membranes, two-dimensional surfaces. or why not p-dimensional p-branes?

p-brane1 theory is the obvious generalization from string theory. however, strings
seem to be special among the branes with their success as a fundamental model.
for instance, increasing the world surface dimensionality increases the probability of
nding divergences (from integrations on the world surface) similar to those found in
quantum eld theories.

a non-technical introduction to string theory is found in [2426]. thorough textbooks
on string theory are [23, 27].

2.2 the point particle

it is now time to do some real calculations to demonstrate how everything we have
said so far applies. and we naturally start with the simplest possible case, the
relativistic point particle.

2.2.1 the action

the action of a relativistic point particle can be written as its mass times the length
of its world line:

s = mz ds.

(2.1)

this length is a distance in spacetime. we let  parameterize the world line, and let
x ( ) be the particles position at some moment. then we can write

ds2 = g dx dx  = dx dx = 

dx 
d

dx
d

d 2.

(2.2)

1 the notation is such that a point particle is called a 0-brane, and a string is called a 1-brane.

26

2. bosonic strings

g denotes the spacetime metric. with the metric signature (, +, . . . , +), a time-
like vector v has negative norm, v2 < 0. and since dx 
is timelike, the overall
d
minus sign above is a conventional choice to make ds2 a positive quantity. we take
the square root of (2.2) and plug back in (2.1) to get the more familiar expression
for the relativistic point particle action:

s = mz dq x  x = mz dq x 2,

(2.3)

where x   x 
d . this action is reparameterization (di ) invariant by
construction. since it is covariantly written as a scalar, and only contains derivatives
of x , it easy to see that it is also poincare invariant.

 = dx 

to show that (2.3) is indeed an appropriate action for the point particle, and
to give an example of how hamiltons principle can be applied, we will now deduce
the equations of motion from this action (in minkowski space). consider a small
variation x  in x . this will give a small variation s in the action, which we nd
as follows.

x   s = mz dq x 2 = mz d q x 2

= mz d

1

( x  x  ) 1

(2.4)

the order of variation and dierentiation can be interchanged, so we have  x  =

d (x ). this, together with a partial integration gives

the rst part leads to a boundary term, which gives zero contribution since the elds
are held xed at the boundaries. hamiltons principle states that the action must be
extremal for the dynamically allowed elds. in other words, we must have s = 0
for arbitrary x . thus we end up with the equation

d

p x 2# = 0.
d " m x

(2.6)

we recognize the quantity within the brackets as the relativistic momentum for a
point particle. (we will soon recover it by direct calculation.) the equation then says
that the momentum is conserved, which is a well known consequence of translational
invariance.

2.2 the point particle

27

the equations of motion read

furthermore, if we let  be proper time, we have  x  x  = 1. in this case
(2.7)

x  = 0,

i.e. the acceleration is zero. this is the familiar result for a free point particle.

we would deduce the same equation of motion if we started from the alternative

action s = mr d x 2. but this action has the disadvantage that the parameter  has

to be the proper time, i.e. it is not reparameterization invariant. for this reason we
will in the following consider the action (2.3).

massless limit from now on we will focus on the massless limit (m  0) of the
action (2.3) above. we read o the lagrangian and nd

l = ml(x,

x) = mq x  x.

(2.8)

this will now be our starting point for a discussion on the massless limit. we know
that a particles energy can be split into the rest energy, which is a constant (e0 = m)
and a kinetic energy. if the total energy becomes very high, it is a good approximation
to neglect the rest energy. thus the massless limit represents a high energy limit of
the point particle.

the derivations presented here for the point particle are also found in [15].

2.2.2 method i

as explained before, the easiest way to nd a massless limit is by introduction of an
auxiliary eld . we write, according to the general theory,

s =

the massless limit is obtained directly by putting m = 0.

(2.9)

(2.10)

it was mentioned as part of the motivation for studying the massless (or ten-
sionless) limits that they lead to conformal invariant theories. we will now see an
example of this. first, we note that the action (2.10) is obviously poincare invariant.
under the dilatation x   (1 + c)x , we get x 2  (1 + c)2 x 2 = (1 + 2c) x 2 to
rst order in c. the action will then be invariant under dilatations if  transforms as

cx  :

  (1  2c)

(2.11)

to rst order.

28

2. bosonic strings

order in b:

the special conformal transformations x   x  + b  xx   1

2 x 2b give to rst
x 2  (1 + 2b x) x 2. thus the action will be invariant if  transforms as
(2.12)

bx  :

  (1  2b  x).

the eld  is an auxiliary eld, so the transformation properties (2.11) and (2.12) are
something we can impose on . and given these properties, we see that the action is
conformally invariant. thus, in the massless limit, we have that the original poincare
symmetry is enlarged to full conformal symmetry.

the equations of motion derived from (2.10) are

 
x 

x 2 = 0,
d
d

( x ) = 0.

(2.13)

(2.14)

x  is a tangent to the world line, so the rst equation says that the particle follows
a lightlike (or null-) curve. with the conformal symmetry in mind, this is a natural
result, since conformal transformations are transformations that preserve the light
cone (c.f. section 1.3.4).

an interesting observation is that the action (2.9) leads us to identify  as an
inverse einbein eld (c.f. appendix a.3). in [28] it is shown that the action for a
point-particle coupled to one-dimensional gravity through the einbein eld e = e1
1
can be written

s =

2z d(cid:18) 1

e

x 2  em2(cid:19) ,

(2.15)

e . let us now see how this compares to the results of method ii.

if we disregard the spin. and by comparison with (2.9) we have the identication

2.2.3 method ii

from the lagrangian l(x,

x) = mp x 2 we nd the canonical momenta

p =

.

(2.16)

this is the familiar relativistic expression for the momentum of a free particle. notice
also that this form sesults independently of which metric is used. this is true because
a metric is a function of positions only, not of their derivatives; g = g (x).

the hamiltonian is dened as

hnaive = p x   l(x,

x).

(2.17)

the elds x  are scalars under dieomorphisms, so the naive hamiltonian vanishes,
as discussed in section 1.4.2. this can also easily be seen explicitly by noting that

p x  = m xm
p x 2

x  = mq x 2 = l.

(2.18)

2.3 the nambu-goto string

29

the expression for p is not invertible so in accordance with what we said in

section 1.2.3 there must exist some constraints. and indeed we nd

p 2  p p =

m x

p x 2

p x 2
 p 2 + m2 = 0.

(2.19)

since the naive hamiltonian vanishes, the total hamiltonian is made from the

constraint as follows

h = (p 2 + m2),

(2.20)

where the coecient  is a lagrange multiplier. we write the phase space action as
described earlier,

sp s =z d(cid:16)p x   (p p + m2)(cid:17) .

(2.21)

now it is time to start simplifying and return to conguration space. to do so we
need to eliminate the momenta. a variations in p gives

p  sp s =z d ( x   2p )p.

(2.22)

for sp s to be zero for arbitrary (though innitesimal) variations p, we need to
have

x   2p  = 0
x 
2

p  =

.

plugging this back into (2.21) we end up with a conguration space action,

(2.23)

(2.24)

comparison with the action (2.9) we found by using method i, reveals that the two
methods give exactly the same result. we just have to identify the auxiliary eld 
with the lagrange multiplier as  = (2)1.

a discussion of the massless limit m = 0 was given in the previous section.

2.3 the nambu-goto string

2.3.1 the action

the action for the point particle is proportional to the length of its world line. this
suggests that we can generalize to a string which sweeps out a world surface and say

30

2. bosonic strings

s = t z da.

(2.25)

that its action is proportional to the area of this surface. in mathematical terms, we
have

t will have have the dimension of energy/length, or (length)2 in natural units. we
thus call it the string tension. it plays a role analogous to the particle mass.

let us denote the spacetime metric by g . if a; a = 0, 1 are world sheet coordi-
nates that parameterize the world surface, we can write the spacetime points of the
surface as x  = x (). the induced metric ab is then given by (see appendix a.5)

ab = g

x 
a

x 
b = g ax bx  .

(2.26)

we write the inverse of this matrix as ab, i.e. abbc = a
simply as   det(ab).
2-dimensional surface embedded in spacetime can be written as (see e.g. [29])

with the introduction of the induced metric, an innitesimal area element of a

c , and its determinant

then we can write the string action as

da =q det(ab)d0d1.

s = t z d2.

(2.27)

(2.28)

this is the famous nambu-goto form [30, 31] of the action for a (bosonic) string.

tensionless limit the high-energy limit of the strings has been studied with dif-
ferent approaches. for a short review, and a list of references, the reader may con-
sult [14].

in analogy with the point particle, we expect the tensionless limit t  0 of strings
to give insight into the high-energy behaviour, just as the massless limit of particles
does. schild [32] was the rst to study this limit. later, the tensionless limit of strings
(not just the nambu-goto string) has been studied by several authors [1317,3336].
we will in the following go through the derivation of dierent tensionless limits,

starting from the nambu-goto string (2.28).

2.3.2 method i

the (reduced) lagrangian is l(x, x) = , and following the general recipe, we

write

s =

1

2z d2(l2 +
2z d2( 

1

= 

)

t 2

t 2


),

(2.29)

2.3 the nambu-goto string

31

where  is the auxiliary eld. this action is equivalent to (2.28), and allows us to
take the t = 0 limit. we nd simply

variations in  and x  give the equations of motion:

st =0

1

2z d2 

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

 
x 

  det(ab) = 0,
bhacbdcdax i = 0.

the induced metric is degenerate, which means that the surface is a null surface.
it means that the world surface has tangent vectors va that are null (lightlike), i.e.
v2 = 0. tensionless strings are for this reason often referred to as null-strings.

a dierence from the point particle is that we cannot give  a geometric inter-

pretation.

conformal invariance as was the case for the point particle, this action is confor-
mally invariant given that  transforms in a special way. if we now for a moment gen-
eralize to d-dimensional surfaces, the induced metric (which is then d-dimensional)
transforms under poincare, dilatation and special conformal transformations as

,ax  :
cx  :
bx  :

ab  ab,
ab  (1 + 2c)ab,
ab  (1 + 2bx )ab.

(2.33)

thus, the combination  in (2.30) is conformally invariant provided that  trans-
forms as

,ax  :
cx  :
bx  :

  ,
  (1  2dc),
  (1  2dbx ).

(2.34)

putting d = 2 gives the string result, which we are interested in here.

2.3.3 method ii
as for a point particle we start by deriving the momenta. dening x   0x  = x

2. bosonic strings

as was the case for the point particle, we cannot use this expression for p to solve
for x , i.e.
it is not invertible. therefore we look for constraints. the constraints
should not be functions of time derivatives ( x ), and this limits the number of
possible candidates. anyway, we nd

p 2 =

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

so the naive hamiltonian vanishes, in accordance with the general discussion in
section 1.4.2. the primary constraints do not give rise to secondary constraints.
thus, the total hamiltonian can be written as a sum of 0 and 1,

h = (p 2 + t 2 x 2) + p x ,

where  and  are lagrange multipliers. this gives the phase space action

sp s =z d2hp x   (pp  + t 2 x  x)  p x i .

the equations of motion for p gives

(2.39)

(2.40)

x   2p    x  = 0

p  =

substituted back into (2.40) we nd after a few rearrangements

scs =z d2

4h x 2  2 x  x + (2  4t 22) x 2i .

(2.42)

a weyl-invariant action we can now identify  and  as components of a metric
eld in this way:

gab =   1

 2  4t 22 ! ,



(2.43)

2.3 the nambu-goto string

where  is any scaling function. we have then g = det(gab) =
write (2.42) as

1

4t 222 , and we can

(2.44)

s =

t

2 z d2ggabab.

this is the weyl-invariant string action, which is further discussed in section 2.5.

however, by this rewriting we are in no better position to study the limit t  0.
to do so, we go back to (2.42), and make another interpretation of the lagrange
multipliers.

limit one
following [15] we introduce an auxiliary vector density (of weight  1
a.1 for an explanation of what is meant by density),

2  see appendix

noting that we can write

v a =

1
2

(1,).

2 x 2 =

11
4v 0v 0 =

00
4v 0v 0

we see that we can write the action (2.42) in the simpler form:

scs =z d2 v av bab 

t 200

v 0v 0 ! .

the tensionless limit is then easily found if we set t = 0. we end up with

st =0 =z d2 v av bab.

the equations of motion follow from variations in v a and x ,

v a  v bab = 0,
x   b(v av bax ) = 0.

(2.45)

(2.46)

(2.47)

(2.48)

(2.49)

the rst equation means that ab has eigenvectors with zero eigenvalue, which again
means that the determinant of the induced metric is zero, i.e. det(ab) = 0. we have
thus the same situation as we found using method i. we may say that the two limits
represent the same physical situation, but are dierently formulated. and accepting
that there must be a formal dierence between the two results is not dicult, as we
have in the present case one extra variable. (v a are two variables, while  is one.)

owing to the di invariance, we can choose a gauge (the transverse gauge) where
v a = (v, 0), where v is a constant. the equations of motion then reduce to

x  = 0;

x 2 = x  x = 0.

(2.50)

34

2. bosonic strings

we conclude that the tensionless string behaves as a collection of massless particles
moving transversally to the direction of the string.
we said above that v a are densities, which is necessary to preserve worldsheet di
invariance. we can interpret the v a elds further by comparing with the weyl-
invariant form (2.44), which by introduction of inverse zweibeins ea
a (c.f. appendix
a.3) can be written

t

s =

2 z d2 eabe a
where e a
a are densities, and a, b, a, b = 0, 1. clearly the limit t  0
(2.47) corresponds to the case when the zweibeins has become parallel, and we can
make the substitution e a

2z d2ab e a

a  t ee a

b ab =

a e b

a e b

b ab,

(2.51)

1

a  v a.

from the transformation properties (2.33) of ab, it is easy to check that (2.47) is
conformally invariant provided v a transform under dilatations and special conformal
transformations as

cx  :
bx  :

v a  (1  c)v a,
v a  (1  b x)v a.

(2.52)

(2.53)

another important symmetry observation is that, with this interpretation of the
lagrange multipliers, the manifest covariance is broken in (2.46), but recovered in
the t = 0 limit, (2.47).

limit two

to nd a limit that resembles the result of method i, it is clear that we must at least
eliminate one degree of freedom. this will now be done, and we start from (2.42)
and eliminate  by solving its equation of motion. the result is immediate:

substituted back into the action, this gives

this is identical to what we obtained using method i, by the identication  = v 1,
and was discussed in the previous section. it is interesting to note that we can arrive
at the same formulation of the limit with both methods. we also note that method
ii gives an additional possible limit, and is thus more general.

the discussion in the previous section, can quite straight forwardly be generalized to
p-branes. this is what we will do in this section. most of what is here written is also
found in [18] and [14].

2.4.1 the action

the p-brane action is a direct generalization of the nambu-goto string action (2.28).
the action is now taken to be proportional to the area of the (p + 1)-dimensional
world surface. (we use the words area, surface or volume even though they may
refer to higher dimensional objects.) we get

s = t z dp+1,

(2.57)

where ab = ax bx is the induced metric as in the previous section. the indices
a, b now take values 0, . . . , p. the action is invariant under the reparametrization
a  a(), which must be true from the geometrical interpretation of the action. it
is also easy to demonstrate, by noting the transformation properties of the integral
measure and the induced metric. the jacobi determinant (1.48) is j = det( a
b ), and
we get

ab 

x 
a

dp+1  j1dp+1,
b
a
x
b  (
d )cd
c )(
  j.

thus the action transforms as

s  t z dp+1j1j = s,

(2.58)

(2.59)

(2.60)

(2.61)

which proves the invariance.
in the p-brane action, the constant t has natural dimensions of (length)(p+1), which
means mass for p = 0 (points) and tension for p = 1 (strings). although the
dimensionality varies with p, we generally refer to t as the p-brane tension. and we
will now turn to the problem of nding models where this constant is allowed to be
zero.

2.4.2 method i

formally this rst method will give exactly the same as it did for strings, since the
action (2.57) looks the same. the only dierence is that ab = ax bx is no longer
a 2  2 matrix, but a (p + 1)  (p + 1) matrix. the result is

s = 

1

2z dp+1( 

t 2


),

(2.62)

36

2. bosonic strings

and the tensionless limit:

st =0
 = 

1

2z dp+1 .

(2.63)

it is found to be conformally invariant in the same way as the string, but now with
d = p + 1 in the  transformations (2.34). as before, the  equation of motion,
det(ab) = 0, says that the world surface is degenerate.

2.4.3 method ii

as the attentive reader may already have guessed, we start by deriving the momenta.

the lagrangian is read o from (2.57) to give l = t. then we nd

p 

l

(0x )

1
2

tab

= 

ab

(0x )

,

where we have used the result in appendix a.2. furthermore we have

ab = gax bx 



ab = 0

abx + 0

b ax

(0x )
ab

ab

(0x )

= 2a0ax.

so the momenta can nally be written

p = ta0ax,

and are not invertible. following the usual route, we go on by searching for con-
straints, and nd

(2.64)

(2.65)

(2.66)

(2.67)

(2.68)

p 2 = t 2a0axb0bx  = t 200,

pkx  = ta0axkx 

= t0

k = 0 when k > 0.

we know that  and 00 contain time derivatives, so the rst of these equations does
not look like a proper constraint at rst sight. but the time derivatives cancel in this
special combination, as we easily see:

00 = 

det ik
det ab

= det ik,

(2.69)

where det ik is the determinant of the spatial part of the -matrix. it contains no
time derivatives. so we have found these constraints:

0  p 2 + t 200  0;

k  pkx   0 for k > 0.

(2.70)

2.4 p-branes

37

since the action is di invariant, and the theory contains only the scalar (under world
volume dieomorphisms) eld x , the naive hamiltonian vanishes (c.f. theorem 1 in
section 1.4.2). the total hamiltonian is thus a sum of the constraints:

h = (p 2 + t 200) + kpkx .

now we are ready to write the phase space action:

sp s =z dp+1hp0x   (p 2 + t 200)  kpkx i .

the equations of motion for p reads

p  =

1
2

(0x   kkx ).

(2.71)

(2.72)

(2.73)

inserted into the phase space action this gives a new conguration space action

scs =z dp+1

1

4h00  2kk0 + ikik  42t 200i .

limit one

in analogy to the string case we introduce the vector density

v a 

1
2

(1,k),

(2.74)

(2.75)

which is now (p + 1)-dimensional. using this variable we can write the action as

s1 =z dp+1"v av bab  t 2 00
v 0v 0# .
the t  0 limit may now be taken and we end up with
1 =z dp+1v av bab.

st =0

(2.76)

(2.77)

we see that, in this sense, the tensionless p-brane is a simple generalization from the
string.

limit two

another way to a tensionless limit is to eliminate k in the action (2.74). the
equations of motion for k gives

iik = k0.

(2.78)

if we dene gij to be the spatial part of ab, i.e. gij = ij, i, j = 1, 2 . . . , p, and gij
as its inverse, we can write

i = gik0k.

(2.79)

38

2. bosonic strings

inserted back into the action, this gives

s2 =z dp+1

1

4h00  gkj0j0k  42t 200i .

(2.80)

furthermore, we nd 00(00  gkj0j0k) = 1, which means that the action can be
written

s2 =z dp+1

1

4(cid:18) 1

00  42t 200(cid:19) .

dening the scalar v  200 we end up with
2z dp+1(cid:18) 

s2 =

1

v  t 2v(cid:19) .

(2.81)

(2.82)

again, this is exactly the same action as we found by using method i (2.62), if we let
 = v 1.
it should be noted that as long as we are interested only in the tensionless limit,
we could set t = 0 already in the hamiltonian (2.71). the subsequent calculations
would then be a little simpler while giving the same result.

2.5 the string in the polyakov form

2.5.1 the action

a weyl-invariant form of the p-brane action can be written [5]

s = d d

2 tz ddg(g  )

d
2 ,

(2.83)

where d = p + 1 is the dimension of the world volume of the membrane. the elds
to be taken as the independent variables are x  and gab.

the action is also world volume di invariant, which is easy to check. consider

the reparametrization   (). then the elds will transform as

a
c

b
d gcd(),

gab()  gab() =
x ()  x () = x ().
b = a

(2.84)

(2.85)

the jacobi matrix is j a

b , and if we let its determinant be written j, we have

1
j

dd,

dd  dd =
g  pg = jg,
g    g   = g  .

(2.86)

(2.87)

(2.88)

2.5 the string in the polyakov form

39

the action will transform as

s  s = z ddpgg  

= z ddgg   = s,

(2.89)

(2.90)

which proves the statement of dieomorphism invariance.

the classical equivalence between the weyl-invariant and nambu-goto type ac-
tions is shown by elimination of the metric elds gab. start from the weyl-invariant
action (2.83), and demand it to extremal with respect to gab,

which gives

2g(g  )

d d

substituted into the action, this gives

s = t z dd,

(2.91)

(2.92)

which is exactly the nambu-goto action for a p-brane.

in the string case when d = 2, the weyl-invariant action is particularly neat.
since we have in mind to derive momenta, we are interested in the x -dependence
of this action. the only place we nd this dependence is in ab; 00 is quadratic and
0i are linear in x. this means that the derivative of   g will depend linearly on
x. thus, for d = 2 we will nd a linear relationship between the momenta and x,
whereas d 6= 2 gives something more complicated because of the exponent d
2 . these
complications will make the calculations considerably more dicult. for this reason
we will in the following consider only the string case (d = 2):

s =

t

2 z d2gg  .

(2.93)

this action was rst described by brinkdi vecchiahowe and by deserzumino
[9, 10], but is often named after polyakov, who has given important contributions to
its investigation. a generalization of this action to p-branes (which is, in contrast to
(2.83), not weyl-invariant) is the howe-tucker action [37]

t

2 z dp+1g (g    (p  1)) .

(2.94)

in the following we will consider the two-dimensional case, the polyakov action (2.93),
and try to derive tensionless limits of it. since it is classically equivalent to the
nambu-goto action, we expect the results here also to be equivalent to those we
found in section 2.3.

40

2. bosonic strings

2.5.2 method i

following the usual logic we get an equivalent action,

s =

1

2z d2 g(g  )2 +

t 2

4! ,

where again  is an auxiliary eld. in the tensionless limit we have:

st =0
 = 

1

2z d2 g(g  )2.

variations of the elds give the equations of motion

  g(gabab)2 = 0,
gab  hggab(g  )2 + 2g(g  )abi = 0,
x  bhg(g  )gabax i = 0.

(2.95)

(2.96)

(2.97)

(2.98)

(2.99)

(2.100)

(2.101)

(2.102)

to see exactly what this means, we use the totally antisymmetric symbol2 ab to
write the inverse of gab as gab = g1acbdgcd, which gives

g1(acbdgcdab)2 = 0,

hg1gab(ecf dgcdef )2 + 2(ecf dgcdef )abi = 0,
bhg1(egf hgef gh)acbdgcdax i = 0.

if g1 = 0 we get from (2.101) the solution ((ecf dgcdef )ab = 0, i.e. ecf dgcdef =
0 or  = 0. however, g1 = 0  det(gab) = g  , which is a situation we are not
interested in. so we assume that g1 6= 0, in which case we nd

acbdgcdab = 0,

(2.103)

which satises all the equations above. the fact that the other equations of motion
reduce to identities by use of (2.103) stems from the form of the action (2.93), which
is not as it should be for method i to work well (c.f. section 1.5.1).

by two-dimensional di invariance we can choose a parameterization that xes
gab to gab = ab, with  as a positive denite function. then, by weyl-invariance,
we may rescale the metric to get gab = ab. (this represents a gauge choice.) then
(2.103) gives det(ab) = 0. and since the induced metric is degenerate in one gauge,
it is degenerate in all systems. so the tensionless polyakov action has generally the
solution

det(ab) = 0.

in the above gauge the x  equation (2.102) becomes

2 in two dimensions we have 00 = 11 = 0, 01 = 1, 10 = 1.

bhacbdcdax i = 0.

(2.104)

(2.105)

2.5 the string in the polyakov form

41

which is what we found for the t  0 limit of the nambu-goto string. hence we
conclude that method i gives exactly the same tensionless limits for the nambu-goto
and polyakov strings. in the next section we will see that this is true also for the
second method.

2.5.3 method ii

we start again by deriving the momenta:

p 
=

l
 x 
tggab ab
1
 x 
2

= tg(g00 x + g10 x),

 

l
 g

= 0.

(2.106)

(2.107)

since  vanishes everywhere, we know that g are not really dynamical variables.
we will later see explicitly that they play (with a suitable identication) the role of
lagrange multipliers.

from the equation for p we see easily that the transformation from conguration
space to phase space is invertible. this means that we can obtain x  from p . simple
rearrangement indeed gives

x =

1

g00 (cid:18) p

tg  g10 x(cid:19) .

(2.108)

the fact that this is possible further means that the momenta are independent func-
x . thus we will have no functions connecting them by m(p, x, x) = 0,
tions of
and hence there will be no constraints in the theory. for higher dimensional weyl-
invariant p-branes we would not nd the momenta to be invertible. in this sense the
string case is special.

now, as we do not have to think about constraints, we go on by explicitly deriving
the hamiltonian. the total hamiltonian will in this case equal the naive hamiltonian.
the way to do this is rst to dene the quantity

h = h(x, x, p )  p x   l(x, x).

(2.109)
x ), we arrive at the hamilto-
if we manage to eliminate time derivatives of x (i.e.
nian h which is a function of x, p and spatial derivatives of x (i.e. x ). thus, if
we start from h and substitute for x  we nd:

h = p x   l

rearranging the terms we can write this as

h =

2t g00g

(p 2 + t 2 x 2) 

g01
g00 p  x.

(2.110)

here we have t in the denominator of the rst term. if we let t  0 that term will
blow up, and the limit will not be well dened. to overcome this problem we can
make the redenitions

(2.111)

(2.112)

this is the same identication as we did in (2.43). interpreting  and  as lagrange
multipliers, this gives exactly the hamiltonian for the nambu-goto string (2.39).

alternative calculation of the hamiltonian in section 1.4.2 (theorem 2) we
saw that dieomorphism invariant models made from tensor elds gab will have a
naive hamiltonian

h = 0ag0a + a0ga0,

(2.113)

where ab = 0 are the euler-lagrange equations associated with gab. to show that
this gives indeed the same result, we will now present an explicit calculation. we
rst have to nd the s.

(2.115)

remember that 00 = x 2 and 11 = x 2, and use equation (2.108) to eliminate x in
favour of the momenta. then we end up with

h =

2gg00t

(p 2 + t 2 x 2) 

g10
g00 ,

(2.116)

which is just what was found above.

we nd the same hamiltonian as in the nambu-goto case, and hence the two models
lead to the same phase space action, and of course the same limits. this result should

2.5 the string in the polyakov form

43

not come as a chock, as the two actions are classically equivalent. we also remember
that in the phase space formulation we were able to deduce the weyl-invariant action
from the nambu-goto action (c.f. section 2.3.3).

one interesting observation concerns the degrees of freedoms. naively, gab has
three degrees of freedom, while  and  are only two degrees of freedom. but owing
to the symmetries, there is no real freedom in gab (remember that it is an auxiliary
eld). the 2d di invariance kills two degrees of freedom, and weyl-invariance
kills the last. similarly, in the nambu-goto case  and  represent no real degrees
of freedom, due to the two-parametric di invariance. the supercial dierence in
degrees of freedom is then understood from the fact that the nambu-goto action has
no weyl-symmetry.

d-branes

d-branes1 [38] are soliton-like, extended objects (so-called topological defects) that
appear naturally in string theory. they are dened by the property that strings can
end on them, but have their own dynamics.

3.1 actions

in [27] the action for a dp-brane is given as

s = tpz dp+1 eq det(ab + bab + fab),

(3.1)

where tp is a constant,  is the dilation eld, and2 fab = 2[aab], aa being a
gauge eld and 2 the inverse of the fundamental string tension. furthermore,

ab()  ax bx  g (x);

bab()  ax bx b(x)

(3.2)

are the induced metric and antisymmetric tensor on the brane. g is the background
(symmetric) metric, and b is the background (antisymmetric) kalb-ramond eld.
the indices take values  = 0, . . . , d  1; a = 0, . . . , p.

the born-infeld action the original born-infeld action [39] was (unsuccessfully)
invented to describe nonlinear electrodynamics, and has the form

s =z d4xq det( + f ),

(3.3)

where  is the minkowski metric, and f = [a] is the electromagnetic eld
strength.

if we exchange  for a general metric g we will have a gravity-coupled model.
furthermore, if we consider the two-dimensional case and use the induced metric ab

1 the d is an abbreviation for dirichlet.
2 remember that a = 

a and [aab] = aab  baa.

45

46

3. d-branes

we will get a kind of string. for higher dimensions we may interpret the action as
describing some kind of p-brane:

s = t z dp+1q det(ab + fab),

(3.4)

where t is some constant. this resembles very much the d-brane action (3.1). thus,
we will call (3.1) the born-infeld action for d-branes.

the dilation e makes no dierence to what concerns the dynamics, and can for
our purposes be disregarded (or taken together with the constant tp). this will be
done in the following. the independent eld variables are the embedding x () and
the gauge elds aa().

a weyl-invariant action it is shown in [40] that the born-infeld action can be
written in the two classically equivalent forms

s = tpz dp+1s(sab(ab + bab + fab))

p+1
2 ,

s =

t

2 z dp+1shsab(ab + bab + fab)  (p  1)i ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

where sab is an auxiliary tensor eld with no symmetry assumed. in the usual way
we have dened s as the determinant, s  det(sab) and sab as the inverse, sabsbc = a
c .
elimination of sab gives back the original form (3.1). the rst of these (3.5) is weyl-
invariant (under rescalings of sab), while the second (3.6) is simpler when it comes to
calculations.

in two dimensions (p = 1) the two actions are the same. for the same reason as
we investigated only the weyl-invariant string in section 2.5, we will for the moment
consider only the two-dimensional case of the weyl-invariant d-brane action.

a reference where the second of the alternative formulations of the d-brane action

has been used is [41].

g(2)p p+1 , where g is the
tp  0 limit the dp-brane tension is given by tp =
string coupling. the tp  0 limit can thus be viewed as a strong coupling limit
where g   and  held xed. we will focus on this limit in what follows.

3.2 the born-infeld action

dening mab  ab +bab +fab and m  det(mab) we write the born-infeld dp-brane
action as

s = tz dp+1m,

(3.7)

what is new compared to the usual p-brane action is the addition of the antisym-
metric terms bab and fab. we will get the old p-brane in the limit aa = 0 and
b = 0.

3.2 the born-infeld action

3.2.1 method i

introduction of an auxiliary eld , and taking the t = 0 limit gives, in the usual
way,

the equation of motion for  is found from a variation :

  det(mab) = 0.

(3.8)

(3.9)

this is similar to what we found for the strings and p-branes. but in the present case
the degeneracy does not imply that the world volume is a null surface (c.f. section
2.3.2). it only gives a relation between the x  and aa elds.

3.2.2 method ii

the calculations presented here are given in more detail by lindstrom and von unge
in [40].
in the following we have for simplicity set b = 0, which means mab =
ab + fab. calculations with the antisymmetric b eld included are given in [42].

where a, b = 0, 1. we may identify e a
a as zweibeins, and the form above then shows
that the dynamics of the tensionless d-brane is governed by an action that involves
a degenerate metric, gab = abe a

a e b

b , of rank 2.

the equations of motion derived from this action can be shown [40] to imply that
the world volume of the brane generally splits into a collection of tensile strings or,
in special cases, massless particles. thus, it leads to a parton picture of d-branes in
this limit.

3.3 weyl-invariant form

in the two-dimensional case we found the weyl-invariant d-brane to be

s =

t

2 z d2ssabmab.

(3.24)

throughout this section we will set b = 0, giving mab = ab + 2[aab]. the
subsequent calculations of tensionless limits resembles much those in the previous
section and those for the polyakov string.

method i as discussed in the introduction (section 1.5.1) the action (3.24) is not
on the form that we need for method i to give dynamical equations for the tensionless
limit. this was also true for the polyakov string action in section 2.5, but in that case
we could nonetheless use method i to make interesting interpretations concerning the
tensionless limit. an important property that made that possible was the symmetries
that allowed us to choose a gauge where the auxiliary metric was equal to the induced
metric, gab = ab (proportionality would be enough). in the present case, however,
the auxiliary tensor sab is not symmetric and hence is 4-parametric. and since
the weyl+di symmetry is still only 3-parametric we cannot by a gauge choice set
sab = mab similar to what we did for the polyakov string.

3.3.1 method ii

the elds to be considered as independent variables in the action (3.24) are x , aa
and sab. let us rst derive the canonical conjugate momenta associated with these
elds.

the second equation (3.26) is obviously not invertible. we have actually found a
momentum p that is completely independent of the elds a. its denition gives then
immediately rise to the constraints

0  p 0  0,
t
1  p 1 +

s(s01  s10)2  0.

(3.29)

(3.30)

the last equation (3.27) says that the conjugate momenta to sab are identically zero.
this follows the pattern of previous results, and sab are non-dynamical variables to
be treated on the same footing as lagrange multipliers.

we are now ready to derive the naive hamiltonian. disregarding ab, we have:

hnaive =  x  + p a aa 

t

ssab(ab + 2(aab  baa))

= f (,

x, 1x) + g(p, a, 1a)

to arrive at a proper hamiltonian we have to eliminate all time derivatives. consider

g = p a0aa  ts

= p aaa0.

(3.31)

if we put together terms with the same coecients we can now write the naive

the consistency condition on the primary constraint 0 gives a secondary gauss

(3.33)

while 1 gives nothing new. there are no tertiary constraints. the four component
elds of sab are lagrange multipliers which can be redened as

(3.34)

(3.36)

including the constraints, we can then write the total hamiltonian as

h = (2 +

p 111p 1
(2)2 + t 211) + 1x  + p aaa0

+0p 0 + 1(p 1 + ) +  ap a

(3.37)

the phase space lagrangian is lp s = 0x  + p a0aa  h, and a variation of 
gives 1 = 0, which means that the constraint 1 = p 1+ in fact makes no dierence.
then we see that we have exactly the same hamiltonian and phase space lagrangian
as we derived from the born-infeld action for the two-dimensional d-brane (d-string)
(3.17). hence, we get the same tensionless limits (3.21) and (3.22)/(3.23).

we have thus the same situation as we found for the polyakov string versus the
nambu-goto string. this should not really come as a surprise, since the string action
can be seen as a special case of the d-string action when we let aa = b = 0, and
sab be symmetric.

rigid strings

rigid strings are strings with an extra curvature term that depends on the spacetime
embedding. they are also referred to as smooth strings, because this extra term
(provided that it has the right sign) makes it energetically favourable for them to be
less creased.

the rigid string was introduced in 1986 as an attempt to nd a string that corre-
sponds to qcd (quantum chromo-dynamics) [43], and, independently, to study the
string near a phase transition [44]. dierent aspects of rigid strings have later been
investigated in [4556].

4.1 the action

the intrinsic curvature of a surface  embedded in a at background space s can be
written by means of the extrinsic curvatures k ib
a generally (up to a total derivative)
as (c.f. appendix a.5)

a k b

a k a
ib ,

r = k ia

ib  k ib

(4.1)
where a, b = 0, 1 are worldsheet indices and i = 2, 3, . . . , d  1 refer to directions
normal to the surface. d is the spacetime dimension. indices are raised and lowered
by the induced metric ab and its inverse ab. the intrinsic curvature is a total
derivative in two dimensions, but the separate terms in (4.1) are not. a generalization
of the nambu-goto action to include curvature can therefore be written [43]

s = tz d2 +

1

2z d2k ia

a k b
ib ,

(4.2)

where, again,  = det(ab) and t is the string tension. the coupling constant  is
referred to as the rigidity parameter.

the term describing the extrinsic curvature contains double derivatives. to get
an action with only rst derivatives, we introduce an extra eld b, and write the
action as in [56],

s = t z d2(cid:18)1 

t
2

bb  abax bb(cid:19) .

(4.3)

54

4. rigid strings

this action is seen to be equivalent to the original one by elimination of b:

(4.4)

b  s = t z d2(cid:16)t bb  abax b(b)(cid:17)
= t z d2(cid:16)t b + b(abax )(cid:17) b.

the covariant dalembertian operator is   abab = 1 aabb, where 

is the covariant derivative with respect to the metric ab. demanding the action to
be extremal, we nd immediately

inserting this solution for b in the action (4.3) we get

b =

the form (4.3) of the action may further be derived from a membrane action [57].

in the following we will focus on the tensionless limit of the rigid string.

4.2 method i

the action (4.3) is not appropriate for method i (see section 1.5.1). for this reason
we will here instead consider the action [53]

s = t z d2q det(ab + hab);

hab  1(acx bdx)cd,
which is equivalent to (4.2) to rst order in 1. the tensionless limit is

st =0
 = 

1

2z d2  det(ab + hab),

and a variation in  gives

 

det(ab + hab) = 0.

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

this equation together with the equation we nd from a variation in x  are the eld
equations for this model.

4.3 method ii

4.3 method ii

55

more interesting than method i is the calculations and results we obtain from the
phase space method. it is a more general method, and usually makes it easier to see
what is going on as we take the limit t  0.
our starting point is the lagrangian

2 and allow for the possibility of n to remain nite as t  0.
l = t(1  n b2  abax bb).

we dene n  t

(4.11)

(4.12)

neither of these equations are invertible, and we nd the following primary con-
straints:

1  2 + t 2 x 2  0,
2   x   0,
3  p x  +  b  0,
4  p + t 2 x b + (1  n b2)2  0.

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

the dieomorphism invariance ensures that the naive hamiltonian is zero, which is
also easy to check by direct calculation. this means that the consistency conditions
(1.26) on the primary constraints take the form

z d2 n{m(), n()}  0,

(4.17)

where n is the lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint n. working out
these conditions will give us the secondary constraints.

secondary constraints since we have so far never really done any thorough cal-
culations to nd secondary constraints, we will now do this in great detail. refer
back to section 1.2.3 for the general theory. we rst have to nd the variational
derivatives of the elds. this is easily done, with the results:

when put inside an integration, we can integrate by parts to get rid of the deriva-
tives of the delta function. this will give rise to a vanishing surface term, and a

4.3 method ii

term that vanishes (weakly) by use of the primary constraints. let us show this for
{2(), 3()}. the expression has meaning only within an integral, and we nd

= 1(cid:16)()2 x(cid:17)  ()1( x)
2 0.

(4.25)

the same can be shown to hold for all the other terms including the factor 1().
thus, the consistency conditions (4.17) yield in general three secondary con-
straints2,

4n 2b  0,
2n 2 x b  0,
2n 2 bb  0.

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

the elds are here to be evaluated at the same world-sheet points .

the limit b = 0 from the original action integral (4.3) we see that in this limit
we recover the nambu-goto action for a string. it is instructive to check that this
will be true also in the phase space picture. if we let b = 0 in the expressions for

the momenta we nd that p  =  = ta0ax , which is of course the same
as for the nambu-goto string. furthermore, 4  0 will be reduced to an identity,
and 3 will be identical to 2. the remaining two constraints will be the same as
in the nambu-goto case,

1 = p 2 + t x 2,
2 = p  x.

(4.29)

(4.30)

since the naive hamiltonian is zero, this immediately tells us that the phase space
action will also be the same.

2 this is dierent from what is found in [56]. in this article the authors use, instead of (4.16),
4 = p  + t 2 x b + (1  n b2)(2  t 2 x 2) and nd {3, 4} = 0. this is obviously not equivalent
with our results.

58

4. rigid strings

the limit t = 0 this is the tensionless case that we are really interested in. the
primary constraints are now reduced to

1 = 2,
2 =  x,
3 = p  x +  b,
4 = p .

(4.31)

(4.32)

(4.33)

(4.34)

since 2  0 the consistency conditions (4.264.28) reduce to identities, so we have
no secondary constraints in the tensionless limit.

the hamiltonian is then just the sum of primary constraints,
h = a2 + b  x + c[p  x +   b] + dp  ,

(4.35)

where a, b, c and d are lagrange multipliers. note that the parameter n did also
vanish as we put t = 0. what we now want to do is to write the phase space action,
and eliminate the momenta to arrive at a new conguration space action. the phase
space action is

this action is only linear in p , and a variation p gives

we can write the action for the tensionless rigid string in a manifestly covariant form,

s =z d2hv aax (v bbb  w bbx)i .

(4.43)

the four degrees of freedom of the lagrange multipliers are now replaced by the four
degrees of freedom in the two vector densities.

variations in the elds give the equations of motion,

a(v av bbx ) = 0,
v aab = 0,
v a(axb)b = w aab,

ahv (aw b)bx   v av bbbi = 0.

(4.44)

(4.45)

(4.46)

(4.47)

the rst two equations are the same as we found for the tensionless nabu-goto
string. what is special for the rigid string must then be found in the remaining two
equations.

equation (4.47) gives

v (aw b)bx   v av bbb = abbc ,

(4.48)

where c  is some spacetime vector. contracting this equation with ax gives

2v aw bab  v av bab = abbc ax
0 = abbc ax,

(4.49)

which says that bc ax, is symmetric, i.e. ac  = cax , where c is some
constant. put into equation (4.47) this gives

ca 
v c 

v (aw b)bx   v av bbb = cabbx 
ca(cid:16)v (aw b)bx   v av bbb(cid:17) = ccx 

cav cv bw abx  = ccx v c
c = abv aw b.



(4.50)

thus we have determined the constant c. using the relation abcd = a
can now write equuation (4.48)

c b
d b
c  a

d we

v aw bbx  + v bw abx   v av bbb = cx v cw a  dx v aw d,

which gives

v bbb = 2w bbx .

this equation put into (4.46) yields

v bbx ab = w bab.

(4.51)

(4.52)

60

4. rigid strings

a contraction of equation (4.51) with ax, and using (4.52) gives us

v bbbax = 2v bbx ab,

which says that det(ab + 2ba) = 0. this relation can (in 2d) be written

det(3(ab)) =  2;

[ab] = ab,

(4.53)

(4.54)

where  = 01  10.
we have seen that method ii does indeed lead to a sensible theory for the tensionless
limit of the rigid string, represented by the eld equations (4.44; 4.45; 4.51; 4.52).
the rst two equations describe a tensionless nambu-goto string, which we derived
in section 2.3. one special solution of the last two equations is the case where w a is
parallel to v a, and ab is parallel to ax , in which case we end up with exactly
the same equations of motion as for the tensionless nambu-goto string.

an interesting question that we do not go into in any more detail, is what role

the b eld actually plays in these equations.

note also that the action (4.43) can be made conformally invariant in the same way
as the tensionless nambu-goto string, if we in addition demand that b transforms
like x .

consider a given manifold s with metric g . suppose furthermore that there exist a
coordinate basis {x} on the manifold, and let comma denote partial derivative with

this action contains metric elds g , their derivatives g , and also their second
derivatives 2g , and was used by hilbert to derive einsteins eld equations only
days after einstein had published his results.

we see that the relation between the connection and the metric,

out as a solution of the eld equations. with the substitution   {}, equation

included. details on these calculations are found e.g. in [59].

if we eliminate  in s[g, ] by solving its equation of motion and substituting back,
we just have to replace  by {}, thus recover the hilbert action s[g]. in this sense
we call s[g, ] a parent action for s[g].
alternatively, we may eliminate the metric elds g . contraction with g in

(5.10) gives

g r (g) = 4.

(if we worked with another spacetime dimension than 4 we would get 2d
right hand side.) inserted back into equation (5.10) we nd

(5.11)
d2  on the

(5.12)

as long as  6= 0 we can eliminate g in s[g, ] and arrive at the eddington-
schrodinger action [61, 62]

s[] =

2

z d4xq det(r ()).

(5.13)

the actions s[g] and s[] are dual, i.e. they are both derivable from the same parent
action s[g, ]. all three actions will of course give us equivalent equations of motion,
so they are classically equivalent.

5.2 method i

63

if we compare with the p-brane actions, we see that s[] resembles the nambu-goto
form (2.28), while s[g, ] is very similar to the howe-tucker action (2.94), and partly
the polyakov action (c.f. section 2.5). but there are important dierences as well.

first, the strings were supposed to live in a background space, i.e. a spacetime
with some xed metric. in the gravitational case, on the other hand, this spacetime
is precisely what is under study. this aspect is in fact a major obstacle in the search
for a quantum eld theory of gravitation.

second, the 

 elds in gravitation have a more complicated nature than the
position elds x  in the string models. for instance, x  are scalars under dieo-
morphisms, while the s are not even tensors.

the limit    from the denition of  we see that the limit may be viewed as
a c  0 limit, or a gn   limit. this is the opposite of the newtonian limit, which
can be thought of as c  . as the speed of light approaches zero, lightcones will
collapse into spacetime lines, and points in space will be disconnected. so this limit
leads to an ultralocal eld theory. these limits have been investigated e.g.
in [63]
and [64] in the search for a quantum description of gravity.

it is possible to make yet another interpretation of the    limit by observing
(which is possible in the hamiltonian formulation) that it is equal to the so-called
zero signature limit. this limit represents some intermediate stage between euclidian
space (signature +1) and minkowski space (signature 1). this viewpoint is taken
by teitelboim [65]. his paper also includes an instructive discussion on what physical
signicance this limit has.

in the following we will see if we can use our well-developed methods as a successful
approach to this limit. general relativity as a theory is quite dierent from the string
models we have investigated so far, and it is dicult to say on beforehand whether
any of the two methods will give anything of physical interest. but it is certainly
worth a try.

5.2 method i

of the actions s[g, ], s[g] and s[] only the latter has the form that makes method
i applicable. we will henceforth consider this action. introducing the auxiliary eld
 we can write a classically equivalent action as

elimination of  will as usual give back the original action, i.e.   s[].

however, we are interested in the    limit, and the action above then gives

(5.15)

5. general relativity

we could redene the auxiliary eld to get rid of the factor 4
2 . but the form above
makes it manifestly clear that the exression is valid only for  6= 0, so we keep it as
it is.

the equations of motion are found by variations  and

2 det(r ()) = 0,
1
2 h(rr ) + (rr )

i = 0,

(5.16)

3!

1
r

where r  det(r()), r = 1
rrr is the inverse of r, and
 is the covariant derivative with  as the connection. the determinant r cancels in
the combination rr , so the second equation is non-trivial even when det(r) = 0,
which is imposed by the rst equation.
the relation (5.12) connecting  to the metric, r () = g , cannot be used
as the equivalence between s[g, ] and s[, ] breaks when we take the limit   .
so even though we could solve the above equations for 
 , the interpretations of
what physics this limit represents would not be immediate.

we do not elaborate more on this here, but turn instead to method ii. this
method employes a much more general and powerful formalism, and we have seen
earlier that it may give rise to several dierent limits. our hope is that within this
possible class of limits we will nd a physically signicant one.

5.3 method ii

in the string case, the most straight forward way to arrive at tensionless limits was
found by starting from the nambu-goto action. and because of its similarities to
the nambu-goto action, we might therefore expect the action s[] to be the best
starting point for deriving    limits in the gravity case. however, we will see
that the similarities are only formal.
q det(r ()). with the denition of the
riemann tensor in terms of  instead of {} we nd the canonical conjugate momenta

(5.18)

5.4 adm approach (method ii)

65

this expression is not zero, and contains time derivatives both in det(r) and r.
still, the hamiltonian is known to be a function independent of time derivatives, so
it is always possible to eliminate time derivatives in favour of momenta. however,
the relation (5.18) for h is clearly unwieldly and makes the subsequent analysis very
hard. it is thus gratifying that there is another set of variables, the adm variables,
in which the analysis becomes tractable.

5.4 adm approach (method ii)

we will now follow the fruitful approach originally made by arnowitt, deser and
misner (adm) [66].

the starting point is the hilbert action with zero cosmological constant (for con-

venience),

s =

1

z d4xgr(g).

(5.19)

the crucial point is the introduction of a new set of variables to replace the ten
metric components of g . in a hamilton description we perform a space and time
split. and because of the rather intricate role of time in general relativity, this is
not as straight forwardly done as before. the way it is done, is by slicing the (4-
dimensional) spacetime s into spacelike (3-dimensional) hypersurfaces . spacetime
may then be parameterized by means of a continuous parameter, such that each value
of this parameter corresponds to one of these hypersurfaces. this parameter is what
we will call time, although it is not necessarily directly related to time as measured
by clocks.

let hab be the 3-dimensional induced metric on , and let hab be its inverse.
indices referring to  (i.e. latin indices, a, b) are raised and lowered with this metric.
now, introduce the lapse function n and shift functions na dened through

g =  nan a  n 2 nb

hab ! ;

n t
a

,  = 0, 1, 2, 3;
a, b = 1, 2, 3.

(5.20)

the metric components {g} are now replaced by the set of variables {hab, n, na}. if
we let ~n be a unit vector normal to the hypersurface , we nd the extrinsic curvature
kab of  as a lie derivative (c.f. appendix a.4) of the metric in the direction of ~n.
this can again be shown to depend on the 3-metric hab and the shift functions in the
following manner [58]:

kab =

1
2

nhab =

1
2n

( hab  danb  dbna),

(5.21)

where da denotes the covariant derivative associated with hab, and the dot means
dierentiation with respect to the time parameter.

the gauss-codazzi equation (c.f. appendix a.5) gives the relation between in-

trinsic curvatures (the ricci scalars) rs on s and r on :

rs = r + kabk ab  k 2,

(5.22)

66

5. general relativity

where k  habkab and k ab = hachbdkcd. from equation (5.20) we nd

g = nh.

put together this means that we can rewrite the action (5.19) to

s =

1

z dx0d3xnh(r + kabk ab  k 2),

(5.23)

(5.24)

where r from now on refers to the intrinsic curvature on the hypersurface, i.e. r =
r.

we may now derive the canonical conjugate momenta:

= 0,

p 
p a 
ab 

l
 n
l
 na
l
 hab

= 0,

=

1


h(k ab  habk).

(5.25)

(5.26)

(5.27)

p and p a are identically zero, which means that n and na are non-dynamical vari-
ables. they play the role of lagrange multipliers, as we will see explicitly later.

equation (5.27) can be inverted to give an expression for kab and hab (by use of

(5.21)),

(ab 

1
2

hab),

kab =

hab =


h
2n 
h

(ab 

1
2

hab) + danb + dbda;

  habab,

(5.28)

(5.29)

which is easy to verify. the fact that we can obtain hab from ab means that we do
not have to search for constraints. this situation is very similar to what was found
for the polyakov form of the string in section 2.5.

the hamiltonian is now straight forward to calculate:

h  ab hab  l

= n(cid:20) 1
h

(abab 

1
2

2) 

1
2

hr(cid:21) + 2abdanb,

(5.30)

where we have redened n  n . this is done to allow for the    limit. a
similar argument was made in section 2.5 for the string case.

the last term in the hamiltonian can be rewritten;

2abdanb = 2 da(abnb)

|

0

{z

}

2nbdaab.

(5.31)

5.4 adm approach (method ii)

67

again, the rst term on the right hand side can be disregarded since it is only a total
derivative. if we consider n and na as lagrange multipliers we see that h is just a
sum of these constraints:

 =

1
h

(abab 

1
2

2) 

1
2

hr,

b = 2daab.

thus, we can write the hamiltonian in this simple form

h = n  + nbb.

(5.32)

(5.33)

(5.34)

the limit   
we see at once that we may take this limit simply by dropping the last term in . and
as mentioned in the beginning, this has the same eect as taking the zero signature
limit   0. the signature  = ~n  ~n of the spacetime metric only inuences on this
term, and enters in such a way that taking   0 removes the term proportional to
hr [65].
this limit has in turn been shown by henneaux [67] to correspond to the four-

dimensional action

s =z d4x(x)(kk  k2); ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(5.35)

he does so by shoving that this action gives the same hamilton formulation (5.34)
as the   0 limit of the general relativity action.
the independent elds in the action (5.35) are the positive scalar density (x)
and the components of a symmetric covariant tensor g(x). this metric g is
degenerate, i.e. det(g) = 0, which means that it has only 9 independent compo-
nents. together with  this gives 10 independent elds, which is the same number
as in the original action.

k is the second fundamental tensor, dened as the lie derivative in a unique

direction ~e,

k =

1
2

eg =

1
2

(eg, + e

,g + e

,g).

(5.36)

and the vector eld ~e is dened through

g = 2ee ;

g 

1
3!

  ggg ,

(5.37)

where g is called the minor of g . the vector ~e is completely determined from
g and . it satises ge = 0 and is thus orthogonal to any other vector v, i.e.
gev = 0.

since the metric is degenerate (i.e. the determinant vanishes), there is no inverse
 . however, the class of symmetric tensors g dened by

g satisfying gg = 

gg = 

  e,

(5.38)

68

5. general relativity

where  is an arbitrary vector satisfying e = 1, can instead serve as an index
raiser which makes k = gk and kk well dened.

for an elaboration of the ideas presented here, the reader should consult [67].

the conclusion of this section is that we are able to nd an interesting limit by use
of the phase space method. this is not as straight forward as in the string cases, but
by introduction of the more suitable adm coordinates, it can be done.

the most troublesome part has turned out to be the way back from phase space
to conguration space. this could not be done easily by elimination of momenta
and lagrange multipliers as before. instead, we adopted the idea of rst proposing
a conguration space action, and then showing that it gives the right hamiltonian.
similar to the string models, we found the limit to correspond to a degenerate
geometry. in the present case, this means a non-riemannian space halfway between
euclidean and minkowski space, which corresponds to a theory of gravity based on
local caroll invariance. (normal gravitation is based on local poincare invariance.)
the 10-parametric caroll group was introduced by levy-lebond [68].

chapter 6

other models

we will now, very briey, take a look on two models which are quite dierent from
those we have studied thus far. the results we nd here will tell us something about
the generality of the methods.

6.1 yang-mills theory

in this section we will consider the simplest of all yang-mills theories, namely abelian
u (1) theory, which is the familiar maxwell theory of electrodynamics.

6.1.1 the action

the gauge eld of electrodynamics is the electromagnetic potential, denoted a. the
electromagnetic eld strength f can then dened as f = a  a. and the
action for free electrodynamics (i.e. without sources) is

s =

1

g2 z d4xf f =

1

g2 z d4xff ,

(6.1)

where g is the coupling constant, equal to the electric charge in our case. note that
this action is not di invariant. (it is not coupled to gravity.) the denition of f
and a variation a together give the maxwell equations.

from now on we will focus on the limit g  , which is a strong coupling limit
relevant at high energies. we want to nd out whether our methods can give any
insight to this limit.

method i we can immediatly say that this method will not lead to anything
interesting, as the lagrangian l = f 2 in the action (6.1) does not have the proper
form.

69

70

6. other models

6.1.2 method ii

to see the time dependence of the lagrangian more explicitly, we rewrite it (keep in
mind that we use the minkowski metric  = (, +, +, +)),

l =

=

1
g2 ff
1
g2 (2f0if0i + fijfij) ;

i, j = 1, 2, 3,

(6.2)

where repeated indices are to be summed over. the momenta are now found to be

p 0 
p i 

l

(0a0)

l

(0ai)

= 0,

4
g2 f0i.

= 

(6.3)

(6.4)

the rst equation says that a0 is a non-dynamical variable to be treated as a la-
grange multiplier (which enforces gauss law). the dynamical variables are ai, and
equation (6.4) can be inverted to give an expression for 0ai:

0ai = 

g2
4

p i + ia0.

the naive hamiltonian is

h  p i0ai 
= p iia0 

1
g2 f  f
g2
pip i 
8

1
g2 fijfij.

this gives the phase space action

sp s =z d4x"p if0i +

g2
8

p ip i +

1

g2 fijfij# .

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

elimination of the momenta p i will of course give us the original action, since we
have no constraints.

the coupling constant g appears both in the numerator and in the denominator,
which means that the g   limit is not well dened unless we can use a trick like
in section 2.5 for eliminating g in the numerator. however, in the present case there
is no lagrange multiplier that can swallow the constant. the conclusion is that
we cannot use the same method to dene a g   limit as we have applied earlier.
the assumption that the ym theory is abelian is not essential. for non-abelian
ym theories things will be more complicated, but the problem of dening a g  
limit will certainly remain.

6.2 chern-simons theory

71

6.2 chern-simons theory

the calculations in this section are mainly based on [69]

6.2.1 the action

the action for free abelian chern-simons theory is

s =



4 z d3xaf  =



2 z d3xaa; , ,  = 0, 1, 2.

(6.8)

under dieomorphisms x  x(x) we have the transformations

d3x  d3j1;
a a  





j  det(a

b 
aa = jaa,

b ); a

xa
 xb ,

(6.9)

(6.10)

which means that the action is di invariant. we may view the chern-simons action
as representing some kind of 3d gravitation. the equations of motion found from a
variation a are

a   a = 0.

(6.11)

we now turn to the problem of nding a reasonable action describing the   0
limit of this model. as for the yang-mills theory, method i will fail to give anything
interesting due to the form of the action.

6.2.2 method ii

the canonical conjugate momenta to the elds a are

 

l

(0a)

=


2

0a,

(6.12)

which gives 0 = 0 and i = 
2 ijaj, where i, j are spatial indices. this legendre
transformation from time derivatives to momenta is not invertible, and we get the
primary constraints:

0  0  0,

i  i 
2

ijaj  0;

i, j = 1, 2.

the naive hamiltonian is found to be

hnaive  0a 


2
= a0ijiaj,

aa = 


2

iaia

(6.13)

(6.14)

(6.15)

72

6. other models

where we have disregarded a total derivative.
(again, this expression is in com-
plete agreement with what we would get by using theorem 2 of section 1.4.2.) the
consistency conditions on the primary constraints are

and lead to

{, hnaive} + {, }  0,

ijiaj  0,
1jja0  212  0,
2jja0 + 112  0.

we thus get one secondary constraint,

3 = ijiaj,

(6.16)

(6.17)

(6.18)

(6.19)

(6.20)

and the conditions on two of the lagrange multipliers, i = ia0. the consistency
condition on the secondary constraint 3 does not give any new constraints.

the total hamiltonian can now be written

h = a0ijiaj + 00 + ia0(i 


2

ijaj) + 3ijiaj,

(6.21)

and the phase space action is found to be

sp s =z d3x(cid:20)if 0i +


2

ija0iaj + 00a0  00  3ijiaj(cid:21) .

(6.22)

taking the   0 limit of this action gives

s=0 =z d3xhif 0i + 00a0  00i .

(6.23)

this action is linear in the momenta . hence we cannot eliminate the momenta
and arrive at a sensible conguration space action. we must therefore conclude that
this approach for studying the   0 limit does not work.

chapter 7

conclusion

one aim of this thesis was to present two methods for deriving tensionless limits of
strings and the analogue in other models. this has been done thoroughly by rst
presenting the most important background theory in chapter 1, and by going through
a series of examples in the subsequent chapters. the reader will hopefully understand
and be able to apply the ideas on basis of this presentation.

one main result of the introductory chapter was the derivation of the naive hamil-
tonian for di invariant theories with only tensor elds. it was demonstrated that
for such models the hamiltonian is constrained to be zero when the elds satisfy the
eld equations.

a second important goal of the thesis was to investigate how widely applicable
the methods are.
it was known from before that they work well for a number of
string models. the derivations in section 2.5 and 3.3 revealed that the methods
work perfectly also if we start from the weyl-invariant form of the bosonic string
and d-string actions. these are models that already at the very beginning contain
lagrange multipliers (an auxiliary metric). and it is a noteworthy result that the
methods apply in such cases as well, which emphasizes their generality.

the calculations for the rigid string also lead us to reasonable actions for the
tensionless limit. but in contrast the other string models, we could not in this case
use the two methods to derive the same form of the action.

applying the methods to general relativity turned out to be a much more cum-
bersome task. method i applied to the eddington-schrodinger action, while we had
to change to adm coordinates for method ii to give expressions that we could handle
in a reasonable way.

finally the examples of chapter 6 demonstrated some of the limitations of the
models. it was noted already in the introduction that method i requires a specic
form of the lagrangian. and when it comes to method ii, it is of course not a
priori given that it should work: we start with an action that is not dened for the
specic limit, and hope that through some mathematical manipulations we can write
an equivalent action that is also dened in the limit. the most surprising is rather
the fact that it does indeed work so well for many theories.

73

74

7. conclusion

as general remarks we note that in the tensionless limit, the string models natu-
rally provide conformally invariant theories, and that the geometries turn out to be
degenerate.

it would be interesting to know if there exist some crucial aspect that determine
whether method ii works, and if so, what this is. it would also be of interest to know
if it is possible to say something general concerning the equality of method i and
method ii. these are proposals for further investigation.

another natural extension of this work, would be to look at supersymmetric

models. this has been done in some extent [15], but still not very thoroughly.

appendix

a.1 tensor densities

in this thesis we have not been very precise when talking about tensors. we have
often referred to quantities as being e.g. scalars when they were really scalar densities.
the lagrangian is one example of this. the distinction has not been an important
feature in our calculations, but we will now give a brief description of the dierence
between tensors and tensor densities.

for coordinate transformations xa  xa = xa(x) we dene the jacobi matrix
b ). the jacobi matrix is the same

b  xa
j a
as what we often call the transformation matrix, denoted a

 xb and the jacobi determinant j  det(j a

b = j a
b .

scalars, vectors and second rank tensors are quantities that transform as

scalar

vector

2nd rank tensor

(x)  (x) = (x),
aa(x)  aa(x) = b
fab(x)  fab(x) = c

aab(x),
ad

b fcd(x).

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

on basis of this, we dene tensor densities to be quantities that transform as tensors,
but with an extra factor of the jacobi determinant. thus, a tensor density of weight
n transforms as

scalar density

vector density

2nd rank tensor density

(x)  (x) = j n(x),
aa(x)  aa(x) = j nb
fab(x)  fab(x) = j nc

aab(x),
ad

bfcd(x).

(a.4)

(a.5)

(a.6)

suppose we have the action s =r dxl(i). with a transformation of the parameter
x the integral measure transforms as dx  dxj1. for the action to be invariant,
the lagrangian l must then be a scalar density of weight 1 (i.e. l  jl).
other examples of scalar densities (of weight 1) are the square root of the space-
time metric g in general relativity, and the square root of the induced metric
, ab = ax bx (under world sheet reparameterizations, c.f. section 2.4).
a.2 derivatives of determinants

consider an nn matrix aab. write its inverse with upper indices, i.e. (a1)ab  aab
c . introduce the set of matrices ( aab), which are (n  1)  (n  1)
and aababc = a

75

76

a. appendix

matrices identical to a except that row a and column b are eliminated. (there are n2
such matrices.) the cofactor matrix cab is an n n matrix which has as its elements
the determinant of the ( aab) matrices, i.e. cab = det( aab). let us write, for short,
det(aab) = a. then we can write

,

aab = (1)a+b cba
a = x(1)y aab = (1)a+c

a

(a.7)

independent of a.

consider a d-dimensional manifold s, and suppose that there exist a coordinate
system {xa}. then we can introduce the coordinate basis forms { dxa}. any one-
form on s can then be described by means of these basis forms, as v = va dxa. we
xa , which then satisfy dxa(~ub) = a
may also dene coordinate basis vectors, ~ua  
b .

the metric tensor can then be written

and we nd

g = gab dxa  dxb;

a, b = 0, . . . , d  1.

~ua  ~ub = g(~ua, ~ub) = gcd dxc(~ua) dxd(~ub) = gab.

(a.11)

(a.12)

we know that, locally, a spacetime manifold behaves as at space. so it must be

possible to introduce a new (position dependent) at basis {ea}, such that

g = ab ea  eb;

a, b = 0, . . . , d  1,

(a.13)

where ab = diag(, +, . . . , +) is the minkowski metric. such a basis is often calleda
tetrad or an orthonormal basis. the new basis forms can be written as a linear
combinations of the coordinate basis forms,

ea(x) = e a

a (x) dxa,

(a.14)

which denes the vielbein e a
a (x). we see that the vielbein can be viewed as a trans-
formation matrix between the curved and at bases. it can, however, not generally
be expressed as a jacobi matrix. together with the equations (a.11) and (a.13), this
gives

gab = abe a

a e b

.

(a.15)

a.4 on lie derivatives

77

writing det(gab)  g, det(e a
immediately

a )  e and remembering that det(ab) = 1 this gives
(a.16)
a = b
a,
we can write dxa = e a
a ea. a one-form (or covariant tensors in general) can now
be written either in the coordinate or at basis as v = va dxa = vaea, and the
components are related through the vielbeins:

if we introduce the inverse vielbein e a

a satisfying e a

a e b

g = e.

a = b

a and e a

a e b

va = e b

a vb;

va = e b

a vb.

(a.17)

indices referring to the coordinate basis are often called einstein indices (denoted
here with small letters), while indices referring to the at basis are called lorentz
indices (denoted with capital letters).

vielbeins are often called vierbeins, also in cases where they are not 4-dimensional.
this formalism is particularly useful when one wants to consider particles with spin
in curved spaces.

a.4 on lie derivatives

the lie derivative is in this thesis denoted ~n, and represents a kind of generalized
directional derivative. for a more thorough presentation, the reader may consult [58].

the lie derivative of a scalar f is dened as

and gives the change in f along ~n. the lie derivative of a vector ~v is

~nf  ~n[f ] = f,n,

~n~v  [~n, ~v] = ~n~v  ~v~n,

(a.18)

(a.19)

and says something about how ~v is changed under a parallel transport along ~n. here
 may be any derivative operator.
and a second rank tensor t as

in a coordinate basis {x} we may write the lie derivative of a 1-form eld 

~n  = (,n + n
~nt = (t,n + tn

,) dx,

, + tn

,) dx  dx.

(a.20)

(a.21)

it can be shown that this holds also if we exchange the partial derivative , with
some covariant derivative . thus, we can write in coordinate form
~nt = (t)n + t(n) + t(n).

(a.22)

if we let  be the covariant derivative associated with some metric g (i.e. n =
n
, + {

}n), then the following result is not very dicult to prove:

~ng = n + n.

(a.23)

a.5 the gauss-codazzi equation

the discussion here is mainly due to wald [58]. consider a d-dimensional manifold
s with a vector basis {~e;  = 0, . . . , d  1} and a corresponding form basis {},
such that (~e ) = 

 . the metric tensor g on s can then be written
g = g   ;

g = g(~e, ~e )  ~e  ~e .

(a.24)

induced metric

let  be a d-dimensional hypersurface embedded in this space. the basis vectors on
this hypersurface are denoted {~ua; a = 0, . . . , d1}, and there are d such vectors. the
corresponding basis forms are denoted { wa}, and satisfy wa(~ub) = a
b . the induced
metric  on  is then

 = ab wa  wb;

ab = (~ua, ~ub)  ~ua  ~ub.

(a.25)

dene {~ni; i = d, . . . , d  1} to be as set of d  d orthonormal vectors perpen-
dicular to . this means ~ni  ~ua = 0 and ~ni  ~nj = ij, where ij is a diagonal matrix
with elements 1, depending on whether the the normal vectors are timelike (1) or
spacelike (+1).
it is now evident that we can write any vector in s as a linear combination of ~ua

and ~ni. especially, we have ~e =  a

 ~ua +  i

 ~ni, which gives

g = ~e  ~e =  a

but we can also decompose by means of ~e, and write ~ua = u 
this decomposition we nd directly

a ~e, ~ni = n

~ni  ~e = n 
~ua  ~e = u 

i g = ni
a g = ua.

(a.28)

equations (a.27) and (a.28) together give ni =  j
ij and ab as the inverse of ij and ab respectively, we nd

 ji, ua =  b

 i
 = ijnj  ni

 a

put into the expression (a.26) for g, this gives

g = h + ijni

h  abuaub.

we will soon demonstrate that h is the induced metric.

we raise and lower greek and latin (middle alphabet) indices with g and
ni,

ij, and their inverses g and ij respectively. thus we have h = g  ni
i ni. note that h is not the inverse of h .
h
 =

we nd immediately

i = ni  nj
which states that h is a tensor tangent to .

i = 0,

(a.31)

consider now an arbitrary tensor t , which lies in . this means that it can be

decomposed in two ways:

t = t    = tab wa  wb.

(a.32)

the relations between the components are

tab = t (~ua, ~ub) = t (~ua)(~ub) = t u 

a u 
b .

(a.33)

the tensor h is of this kind (i.e. tangent to ), so by use of (a.33) and (a.30) we
can write

hab = h u 

a u 

b = cducud u 

a u 

b = cdacbd = ab.

this shows that h is indeed the induced metric, i.e. h = .

form u = h

 v = v  n

in words, this means that the vector ~u is tangent to . thus we may consider h

which gives

ab = ~ua  ~ub = u

(a.37)

this is the expression we use for the induced metric on the string worldsheet.

extrinsic curvature

we may dene the extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface  as the lie derivative of
the metric in directions normal to , i.e. along ~ni. in mathematical terms,

k i
 
=

~nih

~nig =

(a.38)

a. appendix

where  is the covariant derivative associated with g . from the above, we see that
the extrinsic curvature is symmetric, i.e. k i
, and, owing to the projection
factor h

, tangent to , i.e. k i

 = k i

n

j = 0.

riemann curvature

we now restrict to cases where d = d  1, i.e. there is only one normal direction to
the hypersurface . the minkowski metric ij is then replaced by , which is still
+1 if the normal vector is spacelike, and 1 if it is timelike.

the riemann curvature tensor of (s, g) is by denition given by

r

 =   ,

where  is any 1-form eld on s. the corresponding result for vectors t is

r

t = t  t.

(a.39)

(a.40)

similarly, if we let  be the covariant derivative associated with h , we can write
the riemann tensor of (, h) as

r

  =       ,

(a.41)

 now being a 1-form eld on . (quantities with a bar are all referring to .) the
operator  can be shown to be related to  in the following simple way:

 t ...

... = h

  h

  h

 t ...

...,

(a.42)

where t is some tensor on . we dene the ricci tensor r and the ricci scalar r
as

r  r

r  g r ,
r  g r .

let us now derive four useful relations.

(a.49)

(a.50)

this equation is known as the gauss-codazzi equation. using the equations (a.47)
and (a.48) we end up with

r = r  (k 

 )2 + kk  + t.d.,

(a.51)

which gives the general relationship between the intrinsic curvature r on  and the
extrinsic curvature k.

we said that the extrinsic curvatures are tensors tangent to the space , which means
that they can be expressed by means of basis forms wa on  instead of basis forms
 on s. in mathematical terms,

k = k    = kab wa  wb;

,  = 0, . . . , d  1;
a, b = 0, . . . , d  1 = d  2.

(a.52)

on  we use the induced metric ab = hab and its inverse ab to raise and lower
indices. thus we have

t r(k) = k 
t r(k2) = k k  = ggk k = acbdkabkcd.

 = g k = abkab,

this means altogether that equation (a.51) takes the form

r = r + (k a

a )2  kabk ab + t.d.,

(a.53)

connecting quantities that refer to s on the left hand side, and quantities that refer
to  on the right hand side.

82

a. appendix

in general relativity, a natural split is to let  be a spacelike 3-dimensional hyper-
surface. then the normal direction ~n is timelike, i.e.  = 1, which gives

r = r  k 2 + kabk ab + t.d.

(a.54)

this result is used in chapter 5 while doing the space-time split necessary for a
hamilton description of general relativity.

the results above can be generalized to situations where the dimension dierence
between s and  is more than one, so that there are several normal directions ~ni. in
those cases equation (a.53) takes the more general form

r = r + ijk i a

a k j b

b  ijk i

abk jab + t.d.,

(a.55)

which is a result that we apply in chapter 4 when investigating the rigid string.
