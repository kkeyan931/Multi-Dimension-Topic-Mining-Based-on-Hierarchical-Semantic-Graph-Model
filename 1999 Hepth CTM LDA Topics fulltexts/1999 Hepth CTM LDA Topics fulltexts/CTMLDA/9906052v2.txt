abstract

marchesini showed that the fokkerplanck hamiltonian for yang-mills the-
ories is the loop operator. jevicki and rodrigues showed that the fokker
planck hamiltonian of some matrix models concides with temporal gauge
non-critical string eld theory hamiltonians constructed by ishibashi and
kawai (and their collaborators). thus the loop operator for yangmills the-
ory is the temporal gauge hamiltonian for a noncritical string eld theory.
the consistency condition of the string interpretation is the zigzag symmetry
emphasized by polyakov. thus the appropriate starting point for a worldsheet
description of the yangmills string may be temporal gauge.

i. introduction

mandelstam [1] realized the importance of gauge invariant loop observables in yang
mills theory. see also [2]. the fact that a string interpretation for yang-mills theories is
natural is particularly transparent in the loop equation derived by guerra and collaborators
[3], and rediscovered in [4]this equation governs the dynamics of gauge invariant wilson
loops in yangmills theory and there are simple geometric interpretations for the various
terms that appear in terms of string propagation and interactions. however, the manner in
which the loop operator would appear in, for example, a string eld theory equivalent to a
yangmills theory has not been elucidated. the contribution of this paper is to point out
that the loop operator is precisely the temporal gauge string eld theory hamiltonian.

the loop equation is easiest understood in the lattice theory since a precise interpretation
requires a cutothis cuto is not necessarily the same as the cuto used in dening the
quantum gauge theory. dene the loop function for a u(n) gauge theory on a ddimensional

the rst term, which is independent of the lattice action, includes terms that correspond to
the splitting and joining of strings, with the latter term suppressed relative to the former by
a factor of n 2. the equilibrium condition for the stochastic eld theory correlation function
turns out to be the loop equation [5]. independently, jevicki and sakita [6] showed that the
large n saddle point equation of yangmills theory formulated as a collective eld theory
is equivalent to the loop equation, as well.

the asymmetry in the powers of n for joining and splitting interactions is a clue for the
string eld theory interpretation since in temporal gauge one does nd such an asymmetry
between string splitting and string joining vertices [7]. this reassignment of powers of n is
consistent with the usual topological loop counting of string diagrams. the sdependent
term has operators corresponding to the motion in the space of loops, and tadpole opera-
tors that annihilate loops. thinking of s as dening the background conguration of the
space of loops, the propagation and annihilation of loops is background dependent, but the
interactions of loops are background independent. notice that the t hooft coupling g2
ymn
appears only in this term. this is essentially another realization of an idea of horowitz,
lykken, rohm and strominger [8] regarding string eld theory. in the large n limit there
are no terms that can join strings. thus in the large n limit, h acts as a derivation on
products qi w (ci).
in a beautiful set of papers, ishibashi, kawai, and collaborators [7,9,10] have constructed
non-critical string eld theories in temporal gauge. as an example, consider their string eld
theory hamiltonian for the c = 0 model:

hik = z 

0

dl1dl2

l1

l2l1+l2(l1 + l2) + z 

0

dl(l)l + o(g2)

where l annihilates a string of length l, and hl, 

li = (l  l). the term of o(g2) is

g2 z

and describes the merging of strings.  annihilates unmarked loops and  creates marked
loops. the string joining and string splitting terms have dierent powers of g, just as there
are dierent powers of n 1 in the loop joining and splitting terms in the loop operator. this
hamiltonian was rst written down for the c = 1 model by das and jevicki [12] and it was
pointed out subsequently by moore, seiberg and staudacher [13] that it applied as well to
c < 1 models with changes in the tadpole term.

a connected amplitude with b boundaries and h handles comes with a factor g2h2+2b,
which is not the usual topological combination. this can be traced to the fact that the

2

disk amplitude is non-zero and has a factor g0 in this formalism. normalizing connected
amplitudes with respect to the conventionally normalized disk amplitudes gives the usual
euler characteristic power g(22hb). in the temporal gauge interpretation, the tadpole term
is o(1), just as for large n yangmills theory the normalized expectation value is o(1). one
could rescale  and  while preserving the commutation relation to make the joining and
the splitting terms of the same order in g, but this would change the normalization of the
tadpole term as well, making the expectation value of a wilson loop o(n), appropriate for
a string disk amplitude.

jevicki and rodrigues [14] showed that the hamiltonian hik (including the o(g2) term)
arises naturally as the doublescaling limit [11] of the k = 2 matrix model fokkerplanck
hamiltonian. thus one has a direct map from matrix models to noncritical string eld
theories in the temporal gauge, via the fokkerplanck hamiltonian.

crucial to the string interpretation of the fokkerplanck hamiltonian is a consistency
check, equivalent to dieomorphism invariance on the string worldsheet [10,14]. in the case
of the loop operator, it is a trivial generalization of the derivation given in [10](sect. 3) that
the consistency of the string interpretation is equivalent to the zigzag symmetry of wilson
loops, particularly emphasized by polyakov [15].

thus we reach the main conclusion of this paper: the loop operator of yangmills theory
is the temporal gauge string eld theory hamiltonian of a noncritical string theory, provided
that the zigzag symmetry is maintained. this observation does not help in any interesting
computation as it stands, but it suggests that the appropriate place to look for a worldsheet
description of the yangmills string is temporal gauge [9].

the discussion trivially extends to dimensionally reduced and/or supersymmetric [16]

gauge theories, with a(x(s))dx/ds replaced by i(x(s))pn vi(s  sn) in the pathordered

exponential for dimensionally reduced directions. (it is interesting that the fokkerplanck
hamiltonian only depends on the equations of motion of the gauge theory, not on an oshell
action.) this may be of interest in light of the conjectures of banks, fischler, shenker and
susskind [17], and maldacena [18]. for example, the maldacena conjecture [19] suggests an
equivalence between a critical string theory and maximally supersymmetric d = 4 yang
mills theory. the string eld theories that appear in the temporal gauge identication
suggested in this paper are noncriticalas such their existence does not provide evidence
for such conjectures even though these are string theories with the appropriate symmetries.
nevertheless, there is a reason why these non-critical string eld theories are of interest
for the purposes of studying critical strings. what is the dierence between a critical string
amplitude and a noncritical string amplitude? the functional measure for a critical string
amplitude has an integration over the conformal mode and a division by the volume of the
group of conformal transformations, vol(conf). these cancel for correlation functions of
onshell vertex operators, and do not cancel if we consider oshell amplitudes [20]. even
for oshell amplitudes, on the sphere, there are no moduli and vol(conf) is a amplitude
independent constant. on higher genus surfaces, vol(conf) depends on the moduli and
cannot be factored out. for noncritical strings, there is still an integration over the confor-
mal mode, but no corresponding division by vol(conf). thus, if we are interested in tree
amplitudes, we can extract critical string tree amplitudes from a subset of the noncritical
string tree amplitudes.
(recall that string tree amplitudes do not suce to reconstruct
string loop amplitudes [21].) this subset corresponds to onshell string states that have no

3

dependence on the conformal mode. from the fokkerplanck perspective, it is natural to
focus on correlations limdh0| exp(dh)q w (ci)|0i of wilson loops ci that satisfy

[h, w (ci)] = 0 for each i.

it would be interesting to nd the relation between these two sets of objects.
