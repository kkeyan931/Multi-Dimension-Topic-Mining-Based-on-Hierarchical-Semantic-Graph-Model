dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the dlcq method
is investigated in detail using a chiral yukawa model closely
related to the nambu-jona-lasinio model. by classically
solving three constraints characteristic of the light-front for-
malism, we show that the chiral transformation dened on
the light front is equivalent to the usual one when bare
mass is absent. a quantum analysis demonstrates that a
nonperturbative mean-eld solution to the zero-mode con-
straint for a scalar boson  can develop a nonzero conden-
n h i 6= 0 while a perturbative solution cannot.
sate hi =  
this description is due to our identication of the zero-mode
constraint with the gap equation. the mean-eld calculation
claries unusual chiral transformation properties of fermionic
eld, which resolves a seemingly inconsistency between trivi-
ality of the null-plane chiral charge qlf
5 |0i = 0 and nonzero
condensate h i 6= 0. we also calculate masses of scalar and
pseudoscalar bosons for both symmetric and broken phases,
and eventually derive the pcac relation and nonconservation
of qlf

in the broken phase.

i. introduction

chiral symmetry breaking is undoubtedly one of
the most important concepts for understanding hadron
physics in low energy region [1]. the smallness of  and
k masses is beautifully explained if one identies them
with the nambu-goldstone (ng) bosons associated with
the chiral symmetry breaking. an important aspect of
this phenomenon is dynamical formation of ng bosons
as bound states of quarks and gluons in the strong cou-
pling region. however, its complete demonstration in
qcd is not reached yet because of the diculties in
describing bound states in a nonperturbative and rela-
tivistic manner. instead, many people have been inves-
tigating much simpler eective models of qcd. among
them, the nambu-jona-lasinio (njl) model [2] is the
most deeply and thoroughly understood. the njl model
is a 3+1 dimensional four-fermi theory and reproduces
various properties of hadrons concerning the chiral sym-
metry breaking despite some undesirable features such as
nonrenormalizability and lack of connement [3]. nowa-
days the model plays a role of laboratory in which we
can test new ideas proposed for nonperturbative study of

1

low energy qcd. therefore the njl model is the most
appropriate model in which we can check whether the
light-front (lf) quantization can be applied to the dy-
namical chiral symmetry breaking. the lf quantization
is a newly revamped nonperturbative method for solving
relativistic bound states in quantum eld theory [4].

let us explain why the chiral symmetry breaking be-
comes a special issue in the lf formalism. the rea-
son is twofold: the rst is apparent contradiction be-
tween a nontrivial vacuum and a lf trivial vacuum,
and the second is peculiarity of lf chiral transforma-
tion. to resolve these problems is our primary purpose
in the present paper. one of the remarkable merits of
the lf quantization is that the fock vacuum dened by
a free theory is also the vacuum of the full theory. many
technical advantages such as exact fock state expansion
arise from this fact. on the contrary, the conventional
formulation says that the chiral symmetry breaking is es-
sentially a physics of nding another vacuum that breaks
the chiral symmetry but is energetically favored. such
vacuum physics is thought to be very important for
understanding nonperturbative phenomena in low energy
region. therefore to apply the lf formalism to qcd
necessarily entails a problem how to realize such vac-
uum physics within a framework with a trivial vacuum.
for the purpose of understanding this problem, there
are considerable eorts [5] to describe the spontaneous
symmetry breaking in a simple scalar model (4
1+1).
they succeeded in obtaining the critical coupling which
is consistent with the conventional results. the key is to
solve a constraint equation for the longitudinal zero mode
(zero-mode constraint) which appears in the dlcq
(discretized light-cone quantization) method [6]. a
nonzero condensate is realized as a nonperturbative so-
lution of the zero-mode constraint. we will discuss this
method in more detail later.

compared with such extensive studies, only little
is known about the dynamical symmetry breaking in
fermionic systems. especially there have been only few
attempts about the njl model on the lf [710]. at rst
glance, it seems not possible to follow the same route as in
the scalar models because we do not have bosonic elds
as fundamental degrees of freedom in the njl model.
however, we can apply the same idea to the dynamical
symmetry breaking if one introduces bosonic auxiliary
elds to the fermion bilinears and raises them to dynami-

cal variables by adding their kinetic terms. of course the
original fermionic model is reproduced as an innitely
heavy mass limit of the bosonic elds. according to this
idea, we succeeded in describing the dynamical symmetry
breaking (discrete chiral symmetry) in the 1+1 dimen-
sional four-fermi theory (the gross-neveu model) [11].
the present paper is a generalization of this preliminary
work which discussed only discrete chiral symmetry. we
consider a kind of yukawa model with continuous chiral
symmetry, which is obtained from the njl model using
the above technique. we work within the dlcq method
so that we can formulate the problem from the viewpoint
of the zero-mode constraints.
it should be commented
however that it is possible to discuss the dynamical sym-
metry breaking even without introducing auxiliary elds.
in ref. [8], one of the authors insisted the importance of
a fermionic constraint which is again unique to the lf
formulation and has very complicated structure due to
the four-fermi interaction. (another merit of including
scalar elds is a quite simplication of the fermionic con-
straint.) more detailed analysis in this direction will be
reported in the next paper [12].

one more point to be discussed is the unusual behavior
of chiral transformation on the lf. in the lf formula-
tion, a half degree of freedom of the fermion is a de-
pendent variable to be represented by other independent
variables. therefore, chiral transformation should be im-
posed only on the independent component of the fermion
[13]. it is not clear in interacting models whether the lf
chiral transformation is equivalent to the usual one or
not.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section,
we dene the chiral yukawa model which is closely re-
lated to the njl model and introduce our framework,
the dlcq method. the classical aspects of the model
is discussed in sec. iii. here, we see that there are
three constraints (i.e. two zero-mode constraints and one
fermionic constraint). we also show peculiarity of the lf
chiral transformation and explicitly give the null-plane
chiral charge qlf
5 . quantum analysis, which is the main
part of this paper, is developed in sections iv and v. in
sec. iv, we demonstrate that perturbative and nonper-
turbative treatments of the solution to the constraints
give dierent description of the model. in sec. v, we dis-
cuss some physics consequences of the nonperturbative
analysis. especially, we resolve a problem of contradic-
tion between the triviality of the null-plane charge and
the nonzero condensate. we further calculate the masses
of scalars in the symmetric and broken phases. then
we discuss the pcac relations and nonconservation of
the lf chiral charge qlf
in the broken phase. the last
section is devoted to conclusion and discussions.

ii. the model

here we introduce the model (chiral yukawa model)
and summarize the standard knowledge on the chiral
symmetry breaking in the conventional equal-time formu-
lation. we also dene our setup of the problem following
the dlcq method.

a. denition of the model

the njl model was rst introduced as the simplest
3 + 1 dimensional example which exhibits the dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking [2]. in its original form there
were two avors, but a one avor model



2n h(cid:0) aa(cid:1)2

+(cid:0) ai5a(cid:1)2i

lnjl = a(i/  m)a +
also breaks the chiral symmetry which exists in the mass-
less case m = 0. we give an additional internal structure
to the fermion independently of the avor, and treat an
n -component spinor a in order to clarify the validity
of approximation we use. from now on, summation over
a = 1, . . . , n is always implied. since this model is not
renormalizable, we must specify a regularization scheme
such as a cuto to uniquely determine the model and to
obtain nite results.

in this paper, we discuss more general model with

yukawa interactions:

l = a(i/  m)a +

n
22 ( + )
(2 + 2)  ( aa +  ai5a),

n
2



(2.1)

where  () is a scalar (pseudoscalar) boson with mass
/ and  is a dimensionless parameter. if one takes
innitely heavy mass limit for scalars   , the dy-
,
namical scalars become auxiliary elds  =  
i5 and the model goes back to the njl
 =  
model.

n

n

in order to contrast with our lf calculation, let us
briey comment on the usual story of chiral symmetry
breaking in the njl model [2]. when m = 0, both of
the lagrangian densities are invariant under the chiral
transformation:

a  ei5a,
(cid:18) 
(cid:19) (cid:18) cos 2

 sin 2

sin 2

cos 2(cid:19)(cid:18) 

(cid:19)  r(2)(cid:18) 

(cid:19) . (2.3)

(2.2)

it should be reminded that this transformation is, of
course, imposed on all the elds, which is, however, not
the case in the lf formalism. this point will be dis-
cussed later in more detail. the usual story is as fol-
lows: the chiral symmetry breaks down spontaneously
in a quantum level due to nonzero fermion condensate

2

h i 6= 0. the most straightforward demonstration will
be the mean eld approximation with the concept of self-
consistency.
if one has n -component fermion, we can
justify the mean eld approximation by the leading ap-
proximation of 1/n expansion. the self-consistency con-
dition is a crucial key to the description of broken phase.
this condition directly leads to the gap equation which
determines the value of condensate and, equivalently, the
physical fermion mass. as a result of symmetry break-
ing, there emerges a nambu-goldstone boson. since we
do not have any fundamental scalar boson in the njl
model, the ng boson (pion) should be supplied dynami-
cally as a bound state of a fermion and an anti-fermion.
mass of the pionic state indeed vanishes in the chiral
limit.

it will be helpful to comment on the physics mean-
ing of treating the model (2.1). first of all, we should
clearly distinguish our model from the linear  model of
gell-mann and levy [14]. structurally our model resem-
bles the  model in the sense that it consists of bosons
and fermions interacting with each other via yukawa cou-
plings and has a continuous chiral symmetry. however,
an important dierence in our model is the absence of
potential term for scalars. in the linear  model, it is
the wine-bottle potential that induces the chiral symme-
try breaking. therefore the symmetry breaking occurs
in the tree level and the dynamical formation of ng bo-
son can not be seen. what we obtain is only the sigma
condensate hi 6= 0. this naturally leads us to iden-
tify the fermions with nucleons1. on the other hand,
the fermions in our model should be regarded as quarks
rather than nucleons. indeed, as far as the leading or-
der of 1/n expansion is concerned, the model shows the
same behavior as the njl model. for example, straight-
forward calculations such as eective potential [16] or
mean-eld approximation show that the chiral symme-
n h i 6= 0 occurs in the one-loop
try breaking hi =  
quantum level (see appendix a for more details). there-
fore we do not consider our model as a special case of the
linear  model and in order to remind this, we call it the
chiral yukawa model.

it is also very important to view the njl model as a
low-energy eective theory of the chiral yukawa model.
the relation between two models is very similar to that
between the weinberg-salam model and the fermi theory
of weak interaction: the chiral yukawa model is renor-
malizable and the fermions interact with each other by
if we take
exchanging scalar or pseudo-scalar bosons.

the innitely heavy mass limit for bosons /  ,

1however the fermions are sometimes treated as quarks. for
example in the lf formalism, carlitz et al. [15] investigated
the linear  model (i.e., with the wine-bottle potential) re-
garding the fermions as quarks. but such treatment does not
tell anything about dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and
therefore should be clearly distinguished from our standpoint.

then the theory reduces to the njl model with non-
renormalizable four-fermi interactions.
in this sense,
the njl model can be considered as a low energy ef-
fective theory of the chiral yukawa model. such low en-
ergy approximation will be valid when the momentum is
much smaller than the mass of the exchanged particles
p2  2/.
in this paper, we mainly treat the chiral
yukawa model for technical reasons, but what we even-
tually want to know are results of the njl model. there-
fore even if we encounter divergences during calculation
in the chiral yukawa model, we only regularize them by
some cuto scheme and do not renormalize them.

finally, as far as we are discussing such low energy
region, we do not have to worry about the problem of
double counting of physics degrees of freedom.
in the
njl model, the scalar and pseudo-scalar bosons are de-
scribed as quark-antiquark bound states. on the other
hand, we treat the scalars as physically independent de-
grees of freedom in the chiral yukawa model. so if we
regard the fermions and scalars as quarks and mesons,
there is the problem of double counting with which we are
always confronted in treating chiral-quark type models
[17]. however, in the low energy region, or equivalently
for suciently large boson mass   , the scalars be-
come frozen and do not behave as propagating degrees
of freedom.

b. setup in the lf quantization

we analyze the chiral yukawa model (2.1) in the
dlcq method and take special care of the longitudi-
nal zero modes of scalars. in this method, we compactify
the longitudinal space into a circle x  [l, l] with ap-
propriate boundary conditions on elds. for scalars, we
impose periodic boundary conditions at each lf time

(x = l, x) = (x = l, x),
(x = l, x) = (x = l, x),

(2.4)
(2.5)

so that we can explicitly treat the longitudinal zero
modes dened by

0(x) =

0(x) =

1

2lz l
2lz l

1

l

l

dx (x),

dx (x).

(2.6)

(2.7)

then the scalar elds are decomposed into the zero
modes and the remaining oscillation modes:

(x) = 0(x) + (x),
(x) = 0(x) + (x).

(2.8)
(2.9)

on the other hand, we impose an antiperiodic bound-

ary condition for the fermion eld,

a(x = l, x) = a(x = l, x).

(2.10)

3

here we must be careful about the boundary condition
on the bad component of the fermion. as we discuss
in the next section, if we decompose the fermion as

a = a

+ + a

, a

  a,

(2.11)

we nd that  (bad component) is a dependent eld
(see appendix for the denition of ). so the bound-
ary condition on  should be imposed consistently with
the dynamics. for example, if we imposed the periodic
boundary condition on  and antiperiodic on +, the
mass term  and the fermions kinetic term became
antiperiodic. this is not desirable as a term in the la-
grangian and even not consistent with the scalar sector.
then how about the periodic boundary conditions for
both of + and ? in this case we have a dynamical
zero mode of +, which is, however, not important to our
problem because the chiral condensate will be related to
the zero modes of  or . periodic fermion will give
unnecessary intricacy to the problem. therefore the an-
tiperiodic boundary condition (2.10) is appropriate.

iii. classical aspect

classical analysis is necessary for specifying indepen-
dent degrees of freedom. in this section, we determine
the constraint structure of the model and dene the lf
chiral transformation. chiral current and charge are ex-
plicitly given.

a. constraints

the system has three important constraints character-
istic of the lf formalism: a constraint for  (fermionic
constraint) and two constraints for zero modes of bosons
(zero-mode constraints). the euler-lagrange equation
for  itself is the fermionic constraint:

ia

 =

1
2

(i + m +   i5)+a
+ .

(3.1)

also the zero-mode constraints for 0(x) and 0(x)
are easily obtained from x-integration of the euler-
lagrange equations for  and , respectively:

(cid:18) 2
  2

(cid:19)(cid:18) 0

0(cid:19) +

2

n (cid:20) a(x)(cid:18) 1

i5(cid:19) a(x)(cid:21)0

= 0,

where [
b). more explicitly,

]0 denotes integration over x (see appendix

these equations mean that 0 and 0 should be repre-
sented by other independent variables.
if we take the
   limit, the zero-mode constraints are reduced to
zero-mode projected equations of the familiar relations
i5. eventually the in-
 =  
dependent degrees of freedom are nonzero modes of the
scalars , , and the good component of the spinor
+. the above constraints are, of course, derived from
diracs procedure (see appendix c). it is easily found
that they belong to the second class.

b. chiral transformation on the lf

denition of chiral transformation on the lf is dif-
ferent from the usual one eqs. (2.2) and (2.3). this is
because the identication of independent degrees of free-
dom is not the same as usual. as we saw, 0, 0 and a

are dependent variables and should change as a result of
transformation of the independent variables ,  and
a
+. therefore in the lf formulation, we impose the chi-
ral transformation only on the dynamical variables:

+  ei5 a
a
+ ,
(cid:18) 
(cid:19)  r(2)(cid:18) 
(cid:19) ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

where r(2) represents a rotation matrix dened in
eq. (2.3). these are the denition of the lf chiral
transformation.
if we nd that  and (0, 0) also

transform as   ei5  and (cid:18) 0

0(cid:19)  r(2)(cid:18) 0
0(cid:19)

as a result of (3.3) and (3.4), we can say that the lf
chiral transformation is substantially equivalent to the
usual one (2.2) and (2.3). however, what is surprising
about the lf chiral transformation is that the trans-
formation (3.3) is an exact symmetry even for massive
fermion as far as interaction is absent [13]. so it will be
interesting to check whether the lf chiral transforma-
tion in our model is exact or not when a mass term is
present.

in order to see the transformation property of the de-
pendent variables, let us solve the constraints classically.
this means that we completely ignore the ordering of the
variables which becomes a burdensome but important is-
sue in a quantum treatment. the fermionic constraint
(3.1) which was originally a complicated relation in the
purely fermionic njl model2, is now easily solved owing
to introduction of scalars. the zero-mode constraints

mannian numbers. the exact solution obtained is highly non-
local and complicated [12].

are also solved formally. explicit form of the solutions is
given in appendix c. now we nd the transformation of
the zero modes and subsequently that of .

1. massless fermion

let us rst consider the massless fermion case. when
m = 0, it is easy to see that the transformation (3.3) and
(3.4) induces the following:

(cid:18) 0
0(cid:19)  r(2)(cid:18) 0
0(cid:19) ,
  ei5a
a
.

(3.5)

(3.6)

this is identical with the usual chiral transformation.
therefore it is shown that when m = 0 the elds do
transform as (2.2) and (2.3) even on the lf at the clas-
sical level.

now that we know all the transformation laws, it is
straightforward to construct the noether current and
charge. the lagrangian with m = 0 is invariant under
the lf chiral transformations. form of the lf chiral
current is equivalent to the usual one,

 =  a5a +
j5

2n

2(cid:16)  (cid:17).

(3.7)

however, 0, 0 and  in (3.7) should be understood as
solutions of the constraints. on the other hand, the lf
chiral charge qlf
5 does not include
the constrained variables:

l dxr d2x j+

5 =r l

+ 5a

2n

2(cid:16)  (cid:17)(cid:21) ,

(3.8)

qlf

5 =z d3x(cid:20)

which is consistent with the fact that qlf
is a generator
of the chiral rotation for independent variables. trans-
formation of other dependent elds should be obtained
through the change of dynamical variables.

5

2. massive fermion

the massive fermion case is much more complicated.
as mentioned before, an astonishing fact of the lf chi-
ral transformation is that it is an exact symmetry even
for a massive free fermion [13]. when the mass term
is present, the bad component of free fermion does
not transform as eq. (3.6). subsequently, the associated
noether current j 5
 has an extra term proportional to the
bare mass

 = j 5

  im( + + )5

(3.9)

5

nevertheless, the divergence of the current turns out to
be zero bj 5
 = 0 due to the cancellation between the

rst term (j 5
this should be compared with the usual current in the
equal-time quantization: j 5
 =
2im 5, which also holds for interacting theories and
is intimately connected with pcac relation. note that
the lf chiral charge bqlf
5 is equivalent to that
in the massless case due to bj +
5 . this is natural be-
cause the lf chiral transformation is dened irrespective
of the mass term.

5 =r d3xbj +

 =  5, j 5

5 = j +

now, how about the chiral yukawa model? using the
solution for m 6= 0 (see appendix c), the innitesimal
chiral transformation of 0, 0 and  are given as fol-
lows:

(cid:18) 0

and d(x) is the transverse dierential operator dened

do not transform as eqs. (3.5) and (3.6). as a result,
the noether current (3.7) also gets modied by the term
5 is
very complicated but we can see that the + component is
equivalent to that of (3.7). therefore the lf chiral charge
is given by eq. (3.8) even for massive case. however,
contrary to the massive free fermion, the divergence of
 does not vanish due to nontrivial

proportional to m. the explicit form of the currentbj

one of the lessons suggested by these observations
is that when we investigate physics related to massive
fermions (e.g. pcac relation), we had better treat the
current j5
 dened by the massless fermions rather than
. this is clear for the free case: the true lf chiral cur-
 (3.9) dened for the massive fermion vanishes if
we take the divergence while that for massless fermion j 5

gives the usual relation. this is true of the chiral yukawa
model. the divergence of the current (3.7) is given as

 is very complicated. it will be very dicult
. it is not
 makes sense. instead, even
for the massive case, we treat the current (3.7) to discuss
the physics such as pcac. this point will be discussed
later again in section v.

iv. quantum aspects

in the classical analysis, we formally solved the con-
straints in order to nd the lf chiral current and charge.
when m = 0, the resulting hamiltonian is chiral sym-
metric and we do not have any symmetry breaking term.
therefore even if we go to quantum theory with such
hamiltonian, we will not be able to describe the chiral
symmetry breaking. certainly it might be possible that
we could nd a broken phase hamiltonian by adjusting
the operator ordering, but such procedure seems unnat-
ural and tricky. instead, we quantize the model before
solving the constraints. this means that we perform the
dirac quantization for constrained systems. after that,
the constraints are solved quantum mechanically with a
care of the operator ordering. the same route has been
traced by many people who tried to describe the sponta-
neous symmetry breaking of simple scalar systems [5].

calculation of the dirac brackets in our system is
a very complicated task. however, the dirac brackets
between dynamical variables turn out to be standard
ones: quantization conditions for the dynamical vari-
ables , , and a

it is important to note that both of the above mode
expansions are independent of the mass. (the spinors
w(h) are independent of mass. this is clearly shown in
the appendix of ref. [9].) this means that if we calcu-
late n-point green functions at xed time x+ = 0, they
will become independent of the value of mass, which is
not a correct result in general. this undesirable situation
is known as one of the pathological properties of the lf
formalism which needs great care for obtaining correct
results [18]. indeed, as we will see later, to remedy this
problem is indispensable to get a meaningful gap equa-
tion. in many cases, loss of mass information is cured by
a carefully chosen infrared regularization. it should also
be commented that the mass-information loss is certainly
not a desirable feature, but we will nd its usefulness in
describing the broken phase physics. anyway, we must
pay great attention to the fact that naive mode expan-
sion of the (scalar and fermion) elds is independent of
the value of mass.

the fock vacuum |0i is dened by
a(p+

n , p)|0i = a(p+
= ba(p+

n , p)|0i
n , p, h)|0i = da(p+

n , p, h)|0i = 0,

(4.5)

for n > 0. it is worth while emphasizing that the vacuum
of this system is really the fock vacuum since we have no
dynamical zero modes. because of the p+ conservation,
the normal-ordered chiral charge qlf
5 always annihilates
the vacuum:

qlf
5 |0i = 0.

(4.6)

it has been known that any light-like charge qlf au-
tomatically leaves the vacuum invariant qlf|0i = 0
whether or not it generates a symmetry [19].
in a quantum theory, operator ordering becomes an
issue. let us comment on the problem of operator or-
dering and clarify our stance toward it. since the (zero-
mode and fermionic) constraint equations are generally
nonlinear relations among operators, their solutions de-
pend on operator ordering. we must select an appropri-
ate operator ordering. then, what can be the criterion
for this problem? in many papers discussing the spon-
taneous symmetry breaking in dlcq, the weyl order-
ing is adopted on general grounds. however, it is not
clear whether the weyl ordering in constraint equations
makes sense because they include both independent and
dependent variables. the most reliable criterion for de-
termining the operator ordering will be as follows. be-
fore solving the constraint equations, we can calculate

6

the dirac brackets between independent variables and
dependent ones (e.g. [0, +] = ), which are terribly
complicated in our model and we do not display them
in this paper. here we already have to specify the op-
erator ordering. on the other hand, we can solve the
constraint relations with the above ordering and obtain
their solutions such as 0 = 0(, , +). now we
can calculate again the commutators between the solu-
tions (i.e. dependent variables) and independent vari-
ables (e.g.
[0(, , +), +] ) using simple commu-
tators eqs. (4.1) and (4.2). the results should be iden-
tical with those of the dirac bracket.
in other words,
we must nd out such operator ordering that will give a
consistent result in the above sense. this should be the
criterion for an appropriate operator ordering. however,
as you expect, to nd such ordering in our model is an
extremely dicult task. so practically, we just work with
several particular orderings and compare the results. in
our actual calculations, we treat two specic orderings
and check whether the results depend on the ordering
or not. to nd a consistent operator ordering should be
examined in much simpler models.

in the following, we will solve the zero-mode con-
straints in two dierent ways: perturbative and non-
perturbative methods. to solve the constraint is signif-
icant to describe the symmetry breaking on the lf. to
see this, let us decompose the longitudinal zero modes
into c-number parts and normal-ordered operator parts,

0 = (c)
0 = (c)

rectly means nonzero condensate: h0||0i = (c)
h0||0i = (c)

if the c-number part of the solution is nonvanishing, it di-
6= 0 and
6= 0. therefore to nd such nontrivial solu-
tion is necessary to describe the symmetry breaking. we
explicitly demonstrate that perturbative solutions can-
not lead to chiral symmetry breaking while nonpertur-
bative solutions give nonzero vacuum expectation value
for . in both cases, the fermionic constraint is formally
solved (as in eq. (c2)) and inserted into the zero-mode
constraints.

inserting the above expansions into the constraints
eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) with the natural ordering and com-
paring the same order of perturbation, we obtain the so-
lution order by order. for example, the lowest order
solutions are

higher order solutions are given in appendix d.

the chiral transformation of the perturbative solution
in the massless case can be inductively checked. first,
it is easy to see that the 0-th and 1st order solutions ro-
tate symmetrically under the lf chiral transformation
(3.3) and (3.4). if we suppose the n-th order solutions
rotate chirally, the n + 1-th order solutions also behave
the same. eventually the perturbative solution trans-
forms symmetrically under the lf chiral rotation (3.3)
and (3.4),

5 , (cid:3) = 2i .

of course the hamiltonian [cf) eq. (c1)] is also invariant
[qlf
5 , h] = 0 which is the same as the classical analysis
in the previous section.

what is most important is that the vacuum expectation
values of the perturbative solutions vanish in all order
of perturbation h0|0|0i = h0|0|0i = 0. this is easily
veried by using h0|,|0i = 0 and h0|
++|0i = 0.
therefore we are in a chiral symmetric phase:

h0||0i = h0||0i = 0.

b. nonperturbative solutions to the zero-mode

constraints

let us solve the zero-mode constraints using pertur-
bation in terms of the coupling constant . since  is
a dimensionful parameter, we introduce some scale cr
which is much larger than  (cr  ). we regard cr as
a critical coupling of the symmetry breaking which will
be determined later. now we expand the constrained
variables as follows

we next solve the zero-mode constraints using the
mean-eld approximation.
in the following, we work
with a particular operator ordering though the result is
the same as others as far as we discuss the leading or-
der of 1/n expansion. the following ordering greatly
reduces our calculation. substituting the solution of the
fermionic constraint into the zero-mode constraints and
rearrange the ordering, we obtain

the perturbative treatment. however, one can show that
the previous perturbative result does not change with
the above ordering. that is, the perturbative solution
with the above ordering does not lead to chiral symmetry
breaking.

let us rst determine the c-number part of the zero
modes dened by eqs. (4.7) and (4.8). we saw in the clas-
sical analysis that (0, 0) rotates chirally in the massless
case. therefore we choose

m is the bad component of a

(a
m .) therefore it is
natural to consider m to be the physical fermion mass. in
other words, the identication in eq. (4.23) corresponds
to the self-consistency condition.

eq. (4.22) should be the gap equation by which we
can determine (c)
0 and equivalently, the physical fermion
mass m . however, it is not evident to regard it as the
gap equation because eq. (4.22) in the chiral limit m  0
cannot give nonzero m . the same situation was observed
in our previous work on the gross-neveu model [11].
as was discussed in ref. [11], if we want a meaningful
gap equation, we must supply mass information so that
eq. (4.22) possesses a nontrivial solution m 6= 0 in the
chiral limit when we regularize the divergent summation
over n. the need of the mass dependence in eq. (4.22) is
readily understood from the identication in eq. (4.23).
indeed, one can easily check that h0| m m|0i/m should
explicitly depend on m in the equal-time formulation.
this is a typical example of the mass-information loss
on the lf [18] which must be repaired properly for ob-
taining correct results.

it may be possible to regularize the divergent sum-
mation in eq. (4.22) with, say, a heat-kernel damping
factor [11], but such calculation is complicated and not
tractable.
instead, we introduce some cuto that ren-
ders the divergent summation into nite one. such cuto
should be introduced so that the result correctly depends
on the mass m . here for simplicity, we adopt a cuto
which eventually reduces to the parity invariant (pi) cut-
o p <  [8]. from the dispersion relation and the pi
cuto, we nd that the momentum region is restricted to

n = n/l < . therefore we set

form of this gap equation is dierent from those with
familiar cuto schemes such as the three or four momen-
tum cuto [3], but our gap equation behaves exactly the
same as usual. indeed, even in the chiral limit m  0,
this equation is a nonlinear equation for m and when
the coupling constant  is larger than the critical value
cr = 22/2, there is a nontrivial solution m = m0 6= 0
(see fig. 1). this also means that the zero mode of
 has been determined as (c)
0 = m  m. further-
more, one should note that the gap equation (4.27) is
independent of the value of . so we can regard the -
nite  result hi = m  m as the result for innite ;
n h i = m m. (remember that the    limit of
 
n [ ]0.) therefore the chiral symmetry
(3.2) is 0 =  
breaking occurs for arbitrary value of  in the mean-eld
approximation. this is consistent with the result of the
conventional equal-time quantization (see appendix a).
on the other hand, there is a trivial solution m = 0
(when m = 0) even for  > cr and if we select this
solution the resulting theory becomes chiral symmetric.
then there comes a problem which solution should be
physically realized. unfortunately, comparison of the
vacuum energy for both phases does not tell anything
about this problem because the vacuum energies turn
out to be the same. if we found the consistent operator
ordering as discussed before, we could estimate dierence
of the vacuum energies and determine the physically re-
alized phase. even without such calculation, however,
we can say that the symmetric solution is excluded for
 > cr. this is because there emerge tachyonic modes
and the system becomes unstable if we select a trivial
solution for  > cr. this will be again discussed in sec-
tion v-b. so we deal with only the nontrivial solution for
 > cr and do not consider the symmetric solution.

3 finite volume physics itself is intriguing. for example, sim-
ilarly to the equal-time calculation [20], if we make the volume
smaller and smaller, we will meet a critical length lcr beyond
which the chiral symmetry never breaks down. moreover, if
we could determine the l dependence of the physical mass
m (l), it would serve as a prediction for the limiting behavior
of eigenvalues in the numerical dlcq calculation. neverthe-
less, such nite volume physics is outside the scope of this
paper and we do not discuss it anymore. we always assume
l suciently large and ignore the nite volume eects.

comments on other cuto schemes are in order. we
nd a nontrivial equation for m by using the pi cuto.
it was crucial to include the mass information as the reg-
ularization. however, we have to be careful in setting
the cuto. any cuto scheme which holds mass does not
necessarily lead to a physically sensible result [21]. for
example, a two dimensional pi cuto m 2/2 < p+ < 
with a transverse cuto |p| <  gives a wrong re-
sult. the resulting gap equation erroneously predicts
that there is no symmetric phase. it seems important to
introduce a cuto with some symmetry considerations.
indeed, the three momentum cuto respecting the three
dimensional rotation [7] and the pi cuto [8] in our case
predict the existence of the critical coupling constant.

now let us determine the operator parts of the zero
modes by the mean-eld approximation. we approxi-
mate the nonlinear terms in eq. (4.17) by using ab 
ahbi +haib haihbi, where the expectation values are
taken with respect to the fock vacuum. we further ne-
glect contribution from the oscillating modes of scalars

to understand what we did above, let us consider the
relation between our operator ordering and the 1/n ex-
pansion. we have obtained an equation for the c-number
part of 0 (the gap equation) just by taking the vac-
uum expectation value of the zero-mode constraint even
without recourse to the 1/n expansion. this simplic-
ity in obtaining the gap equation is mainly due to our
specic choice of the operator ordering. as has been
commented before, if we take other orderings, our calcu-
lation becomes terrible because of complicated structure
of the dirac brackets between constrained zero modes
and physical variables. however, as far as the leading
term of the 1/n expansion is concerned, the commuta-
tor [0, +] turns out to be of the order of o(1/n ) and
we can ignore the eect of ordering4. furthermore, the
approximation neglecting the scalar oscillating modes is
also justied by the 1/n expansion. from the quantiza-
tion condition (4.1), we nd  is o(n 1/2) whereas 0 is
o(n 0). these considerations justify that our mean-eld
calculation with the specic operator ordering is correct
up to the leading contribution of the 1/n expansion.

before ending this section, it will be better to point
out the merit of the mass-information loss. certainly
it was a demerit in deriving the gap equation, but this
property gives a very important benet to our frame-
work. the fact that the mode expansion is independent
of the value of mass in turn means that the fock vacuum
dened by (4.5) keeps invariant even if we change the
value of mass. we do not have to perform the bogoli-
ubov transformation on the vacuum depending on the
change of mass. therefore the lf vacuum is invariant
even after the fermion acquires dynamical mass m 6= 0.

v. physics in nonperturbative region

in this section, we discuss some physics consequences
of our method. firstly, we explicitly demonstrate how
the triviality of the null-plane chiral charge qlf
5 and the
nonzero chiral condensate reconcile with each other. sec-
ondly, masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons are
calculated from the lagrangian for both phases. finally,
we derive the pcac relation for the chiral current j
5
[eq. (3.7)] and discuss the nonconservation of qlf
5 .

a. null-plane chiral charge vs chiral condensate

5 , i5]|0i = h0|r d3x [j0

in the equal-time quantization, the broken vacuum
does not possess the chiral symmetry qet
5 |0i 6= 0.
the nambu-goldstone phase is characterized by a
nonzero condensate of the order parameter h i and
the more strict expression of qet
5 |0i 6= 0 is a rela-
5 (x), i5]|0i =
tion h0|[qet
2ih0| |0i 6= 0. therefore there is no inconsistency
between these two relations. on the other hand, re-
member that the light-like charge always annihilates
the vacuum. this implies that if a similar relation
, i5] ?= 2i  held on the light front in the
[q(lf)
broken phase h0| |0i 6= 0, it would immediately con-
ict with the triviality of the chiral charge qlf
5 |0i = 0.
in the following we resolve this seemingly inconsistent
situation.

5

the chiral charge qlf

5 dened by eq. (3.8) annihilates
the vacuum and generates the chiral transformation for
the independent variables irrespective of the symmetry.
indeed, we nd

(cid:2)qlf
5 , +(cid:3) = 5+.

5 , (cid:3) = 2i,

(5.2)

these are the fundamental laws of the chiral transforma-
tion. any transformation of the dependent elds 0, 0,
and  should be derived from them.

in the broken phase  > cr, the gap equation has a
nontrivial solution m 6= 0 and the fermion behaves as a
massive fermion with the dynamical mass m . first of
all, let us view the chiral transformation of the massive
fermion operator m dened by eq. (4.24). the result
is already unfamiliar to us:

one can easily show that (op)
is zero due to
h0| m i5m|0i = 0 and antisymmetry of the sign func-
tion (x  y). therefore the terms involving m
and (op)
are the extra compared with the usual chi-
ral transformation. they do not vanish even in the chiral
limit. these extra terms are direct consequences of being
dependent variables and the dynamical generation of the
fermion mass m . unlike the equal-time calculation, the
chiral transformation of the full eld variables becomes
model-dependent in general because a part of the vari-
ables are constrained and the information of interaction
inevitably enters the transformation law of constrained
variables through the solutions.

due to the modication of the transformation law, we
can avoid the inconsistency. the transformation of the
full  eld is given by [qlf

a consistent result:

in addition to the rst term that is equivalent to the usual

that the lf chiral charge is not conserved in the bro-
ken phase. it should be emphasized that the violation
is proportional to the fermions dynamical mass m and
thus does not vanish even in the chiral limit. it is very
interesting that the chiral symmetry breaking in the lf
formulation is expressed as an explicit breaking. the im-
portant dierence, however, is that usual explicit break-
ing does not accompany the gap equation, while in our
case the gap equation plays a very important role in many
aspects. the nonconservation of qlf
on the lf in the

5

broken phase has been discussed by several people in re-
lation to pcac [15,22,23]. particularly, a similar situa-
tion to our conclusion (i.e. the non-conservation of the
null-plane charge in the dlcq method) was found in
the broken phase of the scalar model [23]. the problem
of nonconserving charge should be intimately connected
with the divergence of the chiral current. in sec. v-c, we
will again meet the non-conservation of qlf
as a result
of the pcac relation and peculiar behavior of the pion
zero mode in the chiral limit.

let us turn to the symmetric phase where the cou-
pling is large but slightly less than the critical value

 < cr. in this region, we use the symmetric solution

of the gap equation. if we restrict ourselves to the chiral
limit m = 0, the solution is just a trivial one m = 0.
transformation law in this phase is obtained by simply
substituting m = 0 into the above results. therefore in
the leading order of 1/n expansion, all the dependent
elds transform in a chiral symmetric way:

b. masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons

here we calculate the masses of scalars which are
bound states of fermion and antifermion. unlike the njl
model, we have dynamical scalars in the lagrangian.
therefore it is convenient to evaluate the pole mass of
the scalars directly from their propagators without con-
sidering bound-state equations. the procedure of calcu-
lating the pole masses is as follows. first we insert the
broken or unbroken solutions 0, 0, and  into the
original lagrangian. for simplicity, we ignore the nite l
eect. this is because we are only interested in the ef-
fects of the condensate (c)
and the nonzero constituent
0
mass m . next, reading the fermion propagator from the
lagrangian, we calculate the scalar propagators ,(k2)
upto one loop of the fermion. finally, the pole masses
are obtained from the equation 1

,(k2 = m2

,) = 0.

the explicit form of f (k2, m 2) with this cuto is given in
appendix e. then we obtain highly complicated nonlin-
ear equations for m2

e. first of all, it is almost trivial that the equation for
m has a solution m = 0 in the chiral limit. for small

where m0 is a fermion condensate in the chiral limit5 and
fepi(k2  0, m 2
0 ) is independent of m (see appendix e).
therefore we have checked that the mass of the pion goes
to zero in the chiral limit and now we can identify it with
the ng boson.

the mass of  is determined in the same way. for
example, in the chiral and heavy mass limit m  0,  
 = (2m )2 which is
, one can easily nd a solution m2
known to exist in the njl model in the chiral limit.

it is important to recognize that eq. (5.27) implies the
existence of tachyonic modes for  > cr as we mentioned
before. indeed, if we assume  > cr, we nd a negative
solution m2

solution to the zero-mode constraint, then the resulting
theory becomes unstable for  > cr. so we must select
the broken solution above the critical coupling.

vi. conclusion and discussions

we have studied a method of describing the dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking on the lf. our description is
based on the idea in dlcq that the symmetry break-
ing is achieved by solving the zero-mode constraints,
which already succeeded to some extent in describing the
spontaneous symmetry breaking in simple scalar models.
the point is that we can utilize this idea even for the
dynamical symmetry breaking in fermionic systems if we
introduce bosonic auxiliary elds for  and i5, and
treat them as dynamical variables by adding their kinetic
terms. then the problem can be formulated such that we
nd a nontrivial solution to the zero-mode constraint.
we exemplied this idea in the njl model. the model
we studied is the chiral yukawa model, which reproduces
the njl model in the innitely heavy mass limit of the
scalars. within this model, we showed in the massless
case the equivalence between light-front chiral trans-
formation and the usual one by classically solving the
three (i.e. two zero-mode and one fermionic) constraints.
this allowed us to construct the chiral current j5
 and
charge qlf
5 . even if we solve the constraints classically,
the resulting theory cannot have a symmetry breaking
term. quantum analysis showed that the zero-mode con-
straint for a scalar boson  became the gap equation in
nonperturbative treatment, which lead to nonzero con-
densate hi 6= 0 and equivalently to the chiral symmetry
breakdown. we found the critical coupling cr beyond
which the fermion acquires nonzero dynamical mass. on
the other hand, a perturbative solution could not give
fermion condensate even in the quantum theory.

the most important key of our description was the
identication of the zero-mode constraint of  with the
gap equation. this was suered from a severe problem
that the correct mass dependence disappears from the
mode expansion. of course this is a demerit of the lf
formalism and we have to carefully incorporate mass de-
pendence into e.g. h i when we regularize its infrared
divergence. it is suggestive that cuto schemes with sym-
metry consideration such as parity or rotational invari-
ance lead to physically acceptable results. contrary to
such negative aspects, the mass-information loss has a
useful and important aspect. it follows that the fock vac-
uum keeps invariant even if we change the value of mass.
therefore the vacuum does not change even though sym-
metry breaking occurs and the fermion acquires dynam-
ical mass.

15

in our formalism, the vacuum is exactly the fock vac-
uum. the inclusion of dynamical scalar elds was nec-
essary to clarify the structure of the hilbert space and
the triviality of the vacuum. the way of realizing bro-
ken phase is that the vacuum is still trivial but the op-
erator structure of the dependent variables changes. in
other words, the vacuum physics in conventional for-
mulation is converted into the hamiltonian through the
dependent variables. the zero modes of scalars and the
bad component  are constrained variables and dier-
ently expressed by physical variables depending on the
phases. related to this, the lf chiral transformation
of the dependent variables also becomes unusual in the
broken phase. consequently, a seemingly contradiction
between the triviality of the null-plane charge qlf
5 |0i = 0
and the chiral condensate h i 6= 0 is resolved.
we further calculated masses of  and  for both sym-
metric and broken phases. in the broken phase, the mass
of  goes to zero in the chiral limit, which is consistent
with the ng theorem. our result is consistent with the
gor relation. if we substitute symmetric solution into
the lagrangian, there appear tachyon modes for  > cr.
therefore we can say that when  > cr, physically real-
ized phase is the broken phase. certainly we have mass-
less pion in the model, but it is very dicult to verify
the ng theorem in general on the lf. this is because we
have nonlocal interaction and because the chiral transfor-
mation of the full elds explicitly depends on the model.
both of these arise from the fact that in the lf formal-
ism the bad component of fermion and zero modes of
scalars are constrained variables. however, we have suc-
ceeded in deriving the pcac relation. this was enabled
by utilizing the current j
5 which was the noether current
dened for the massless fermion. the massive current
5 becomes complicated and it is almost hopeless to deal
with it. the physics meaning of this discrepancy between
j
5 is still not clear but it seems that the usual
current j
5 is favorable for discussing the usual chiral
symmetry (not the lf chiral symmetry).

bj
5 and bj

5 does not conserve +qlf
5

one of the most important conclusion of our analysis
is the nonconservation of the lf chiral charge qlf
5 . this
can be shown both by direct calculation of [qlf
5 , hlf]
using the unusual chiral transformation law and by uti-
lizing the pcac relation. in the broken phase, the chiral
charge qlf
6= 0 even in the
chiral limit. the singular behavior 1/m of the pion zero
mode is essential to give a nite violation of +qlf
6= 0.
in our calculation, nonperturbative implied the
mean-eld approximation. this mean-eld calculation is
justied as the leading order approximation in the 1/n
expansion. in principle, we can develop a systematic 1/n
expansion to go beyond the mean-eld result. neverthe-
less, the higher order will severely depend on the operator
ordering and it is not clear whether the result with our
specic ordering makes sense. if we want to go beyond
the leading order, we have to determine the consistent
operator ordering according to the criterion discussed in
the text. since this is a very dicult task in our model,

5

it should be examined in much simpler models such as
1+1 dimensional yukawa theory.

it will be challenging to use other nonperturbative
method to solve the zero-mode constraint. for example,
tamm-danco approximation which truncates the fock
space into a few particle states will give some nontriv-
ial results. notice that our leading 1/n approximation
corresponds to the two body truncation since multiquark
states give higher order contribution.

our method here heavily relies on the introduction of
auxiliary elds. so it seems natural to ask a question:
can we describe the chiral symmetry breaking without
introducing the auxiliary elds? the answer is of course
yes. even though we do not have zero mode constraints,
it is possible to describe the chiral symmetry breaking on
the lf. its explicit demonstration in the purely fermionic
njl model will be given in our next paper [12]. as far
as the njl model is concerned, to solve the fermionic
constraint becomes of great importance.

there still remain many problems which cannot be dis-
cussed in our model. one of them is the issue of renor-
malization. in a renormalizable theory, if one introduces
an infrared cuto and excludes the zero mode degrees of
freedom from the beginning, then the vacuum physics
should be discussed as the problem of renormalization
with nonperturbative infrared counter terms. relation
between such counter term approach [25] and the zero-
mode approach presented here is not clear. we need
further investigation for understanding how to describe
the chiral symmetry breaking in lfqcd.

appendix a: the chiral yukawa model

eective potential for scalars in the chiral yukawa
model (2.1) is easily calculated in the leading order of
1/n expansion [16]. exactly in the same way as in the
gross-neveu model [26], we nd that the leading contri-
bution comes from the fermion one-loop diagrams. note
that the inclusion of kinetic terms for scalars has no ef-
fect on the leading eective potential. since the scalar
propagator is o(1/n ), eects of the kinetic term (i.e. 
dependence) emerges from the next leading order. the
eective potential v (, ) in the leading order is inde-
pendent of  and is given by

v (, )/n =

which is the same result as that of the njl model. there-
fore evaluating the integral and dierentiating v (,  =
0) with respect to , we obtain the gap equation which
determines the vacuum expectation value of .

now let us turn to the mean-eld approximation. us-

in the mean-eld approximation (=leading
therefore,
order of 1/n expansion), the chiral yukawa model al-
lows both fermion and scalar condensates. however,
in higher order, fermion bilinears and scalars can in-
dependently take their vevs and the same relations
do not necessarily hold. the euler-lagrange equation
for fermion in the mean-eld approximation becomes
(i/  m  hi  hii5) = 0. evaluating the fermion
condensate in a self-consistent way, we obtain the gap
equation.

in dlcq, we set x nite x  [l, l] with some

if we ignore ordering of the variables, it is not dicult

that however this solution still contains the zero modes
0 and 0 and thus is not a complete solution. substi-
tuting (c2) into eq. (3.2), we have equations only for 0
and 0. then the formal solution is given by

the nal expression for  is reached after we insert

nored the ordering in the classical treatment, the op-
erator ordering becomes an issue in a quantum theory,
which makes the analysis very complicated.

appendix d: perturbative solution to

the zero-mode constraints in

quantum analysis

let us solve the zero-mode constraints in perturbation
theory with the natural ordering in eqs. (3.1) and (3.2).
in addition to the expansions (4.9)-(4.11), it is convenient
to dene the expansion of :

a =

xn=0(cid:18) 
cr(cid:19)n

the rest is the oscillating part:

f (x) = f (x)  f0(x).

for some composite elds, we use the notation [
their zero modes:

the inverse of the dierential operator  is dened as

where (x) is a sign function

(x) =( 1 (x > 0)

appendix c: constraints and their

classical solutions

since systems on the lf always have several con-
straints, the lf quantization must be performed using
diracs hamiltonian formalism for constrained systems.
the chiral yukawa model has six primary constraints.
among them, consistency conditions for 1 = 0  0
and 2 = 0  0 ( is a conjugate momenta of ) gen-
erate the zero-mode constraints (3.2), while 3 =  
0 generates the fermionic constraint (3.1). the consis-
tency is calculated by i = {i, hlf + j j}pb  0 with
the canonical light-front hamiltonian hlf = p 

p = p

(e4)

similarly, if we know the solution up to n-th order, we
easily obtain the (n + 1)-th order solution because the
constraint equation is written as follows
