abstract: when the gauge groups of the two heterotic string theories are broken,

over tori, to their so(16)  so(16) subgroups, the winding modes correspond to

representations which are spinorial with respect to those subgroups. globally, the two

subgroups are isomorphic neither to so(16)  so(16) nor to each other. any attempt

to formulate the t-duality of the two theories on topologically non-trivial compacti-

cation manifolds must therefore take into account various generalizations of the spin

structure concept. we give here a global formulation of t-duality, and show, with the

aid of simple examples, that two congurations which appear to be t-dual at the local

level can fail to be globally dual.

1. introduction

a riemannian structure on a smooth manifold m is a reduction [1] of its bundle

of linear frames to an o(n) bundle o(m ), where o(n) is the group of n  n orthogonal

matrices. this group is neither connected nor simply connected; however, it can in

eect be replaced by simpler groups if m satises certain topological conditions.

if

o(m ) reduces to a bundle with a connected structural group, then m acquires an

orientation, and if this connected group lifts to its universal cover, then m is said to

have a spin structure. these simplications are of course not always possible : the

o(4) associated with the real projective space rp 4 cannot be reduced to so(4), and

the so(4) associated with the complex projective space cp 2 cannot be lifted to its

non-trivial double cover spin(4).

gauge theory can be regarded as a generalisation of riemannian geometry, in which

one considers arbitrary principal g-bundles [1] on m , instead of o(m ). as in the rie-

mannian case, g need be neither connected nor simply connected, and so one might

expect to confront problems analogous to the existence of orientations and spin struc-

tures. in fact, this analogy has not attracted a great deal of attention, partly because

gauge theory itself does not accord preference to any one of the lie groups with a given

lie algebra. if we had reason to believe, for example, that the gauge group of so(10)

grand unication is really o(10), then indeed it would be of interest to investigate

o(10) gauge congurations (over necessarily topologically non-trivial base manifolds)

which cannot break to so(10), and so(10) congurations which cannot lift to spin(10).

(such congurations do exist.) the point, however, is that we have, a priori, no reason

to prefer o(10) to so(10) or spin(10) or p in(10) or any of the other [2] lie groups

with this lie algebra. this is where the analogy with riemannian geometry appears to

break down.

the advent of string theories [3], however, has changed this situation. these theories

are so severely constrained that they do in fact dictate the precise global structures of

their gauge groups. in the case of the e8  e8 heterotic theory, the gauge group is

2

(e8  e8)  z2, where  denotes a semi-direct product, and z2 acts by exchanging the

two e8 factors. (see, for example, ref.

[4] for a discussion of the signicance of this

z2.) thus, the gauge group is disconnected, and so a property analogous to orientability

must be considered. however, e8  e8 is simply connected, so there is no analogue of

spin structures here. by contrast, the full gauge group of the so(32) heterotic theory

is the group usually denoted by spin(32)/z2. unlike e8  e8 (and so(32)) this group

has no outer automorphism, and so [5] it has no non-trivial disconnected version; thus,

questions of orientability do not arise here. however, spin(32)/z2 is obviously not

simply connected, so the possible non-existence of spin structures is an issue [6].

we see, then, that the two heterotic string theories do require us to consider the

consequences of having topologically non-trivial gauge groups. the two theories appear,

however, to behave in opposite ways, with one gauge group being disconnected but with

a simply connected identity component, while the other is connected but not simply

connected. that such appearances are deceptive is, of course, the lesson of the duality

revolution [7]. the objective of this work is to understand the role of these two specic

kinds of topological non-triviality in maintaining (or obstructing) the t-duality between

the two heterotic string theories. (note that, throughout this work, we interpret t-

duality in a very broad sense. any mapping of the gauge and matter elds of one

heterotic theory to those of the other will be called t-duality here.)

the two heterotic theories have, of course , dierent gauge groups, and these groups

lead, as above, to dierent topological complications. the two lie algebras, however,

have much in common :

in particular, they have a common maximal, maximal-rank

subalgebra isomorphic to the algebra of so(16)  so(16). the t -duality between the

two heterotic theories has to be established through (e8  e8)  z2 and spin(32)/z2

congurations such that each group is broken to the common so(16)  so(16) sub-

group. the problem here, as was pointed out in ref.[5], is that this common subgroup

does not exist  the two so(16)  so(16) algebras exponentiate to completely dierent

3

subgroups. these are

[(spin(16)/z2)  (spin(16)/z2)]  z2  (e8  e8)  z2

and

[(spin(16)  (spin(16))/(z2  z2)]  z2  spin(32)/z2,

where, in both cases, the semidirect product with z2 is dened through the exchange

of the two local factors. notice that the subgroups are certainly more closely related

than the original pair : they have the same lie algebra, they both have two connected

components, and they both have z2  z2 as the fundamental group of the identity

component; but they are not isomorphic. however, it was also shown in ref.

[5] that

they have a common double cover, which  crucially  is not the universal cover. t -

duality, therefore, can only be established at that level. this assumes, however, that the

relevant gauge congurations obtained from breaking (e8  e8)  z2 and spin(32)/z2

can indeed be lifted to this common double cover. this, again, involves a gauge-theoretic

analogue of the question of the existence of spin structures. clearly, a full understanding

of t -duality will require an analysis of the theory of gauge spinors for these groups.

it will also be useful to have concrete examples of (e8  e8)  z2 and spin(32)/z2

congurations such that the above subgroups do not lift to the double cover : cases in

which t -duality is topologically obstructed.

we begin with a general analysis of the problem of comparing two distinct gauge

theories over a given manifold. then we turn to the details of the specic groups

involved in string theory, before giving a general formulation of the topological aspects

of t -duality. we conclude with several very simple concrete examples which show that

it is necessary to take certain obstructions into account when discussing t -duality over

topologically non-trivial space-times.

2. gauge groups with common subgroups.

let g1 and g2 be compact lie groups such that both have a proper compact

subgroup isomorphic to h. (for the present, we assume that the isomorphisms are

4

global; we shall consider the local case below.) t -duality involves, among other things,

a process of comparing or exchanging gauge and matter elds associated with two

dierent gauge groups. it is not entirely clear what this notion means from a global

point of view, however. gauge and matter elds associated with g1 are essentially

dened not on the space-time m , but rather on some principal g1 bre bundle p1

over m , and similarly for g2. evidently it does not make sense in general to speak of

comparing elds on p1 with elds on p2; to make sense of it, we must exploit the

common subgroup h.

let us begin with a principal g1 bundle p1 which reduces to an h-subbundle q.

(notice that this is a condition on p1, and that the condition is more restrictive for

smaller h : in the extreme case where h = {identity}, p1 must be trivial. thus

the following construction is most satisfactory if h is maximal in g1 and g2.) now,

because h is also a subgroup of g2, it acts on q  g2 by

h  h : (q, g2)  (qh, h1g2),

and so we can dene

p2 = (q  g2)/h.

then p2 admits a natural action to the right by g2, with p2/g2 = m , and one can

show [8] that p2 is a principal g2-bundle over m . thus any g1-bundle which reduces

to h will dene a g2 bundle in a natural way.

now let gi be the lie algebra of gi and let h be the algebra of h. since h is

assumed to be compact, a standard procedure allows us to construct a direct sum,

gi = h  bi,

such that adgi(h), the restriction to h of the adjoint representation of gi, satises

adgi(h)bi = bi. therefore if 1 is any connection form on p1 and 1|q is its restriction

to q, then setting

1|q = h1|q  b11|q,

5

we nd that each component transforms separately under the action of adg1(h). it

follows [1] that h1|q denes a connection on q. now let p2 be dened as above, and

let [q, g2]h  p2, where q  q, g2  g2. then we can dene a connection on p2 by

2([q, g2]h) = adg2 (g1

2 )h1(q);

it is easy to verify that 2 is well-dened on p2 and that it is a connection form. thus

any connection on p1 denes a connection on p2. (adding a tensorial b2-valued form

[1] to 2 will give us other connections on p2 with h-components coinciding with the

h-component of 1)

next, consider matter elds. these are conventionally thought of as cross-sections of

associated bundles, but for purposes of global geometry it is preferable to regard them as

equivariant functions on principal bundles. let f be a function on a principal g-bundle

p , taking its values in a nite-dimensional vector space v which aords a representation

 of g. if f satises r

gf = (g1)f for every g  g, then [1] f denes a cross-section

of the associated bundle dened by v and ; conversely, every such cross-section denes

a function f . we shall therefore refer to such functions on p as matter elds. (the

reader who nds this unnatural may wish to think of the traditional denitions of

vector elds and matter multiplets in terms of components. the denition of matter

elds used here is simply a global version of that tradition.) let f1 be a matter eld on

the bundle p1 discussed earlier, taking its values in v1 and equivariant with respect to

1. restricting f1 to q and 1 to h, we obtain a matter eld on q taking its values in

v1. the peter-weyl theorem [9] implies, since all of our groups are compact, that there

exists a representation of g2, 2, which restricts to this representation of h. we can

now dene a matter eld f2 on p2 by

f2([q, g2]h ) = 2(g1

2 )f1(q);

this is well-dened, since 2((h1g2)1) = 2(g1

2 )1(h) when acting on v1.

(see

also ref.

[9] on frobenius reciprocity.) thus we see that g1 matter elds can be

re-interpreted as g2 matter elds.

6

to conclude, then, we have made the following two observations. first, if g1 and

g2 are gauge groups, then in general it is dicult to compare g2 gauge and matter elds

with g1 gauge and matter elds, because these elds live on dierent spaces. second,

however, such comparisons are possible if g1 and g2 have a large common subgroup

h, provided that the g1 and g2 principal bundles reduce to a common h-bundle. one

can only expect any kind of duality to work in the latter case.

3. gauge spinors

let h be a connected, compact, non-simply-connected lie group, and let eh be
some non-trivial nite cover (not necessarily the universal cover) of h, so that eh has
a nite central subgroup n with eh/n = h. let eq be a principal eh-bundle over a
manifold m ; then q = eq/n is a principal h-bundle over m . if f is a matter eld on
eq, then it may or may not be invariant with respect to n ; this will be determined by the

representation in which it takes its values. we shall say that f is vectorial with respect

to h if it is invariant with respect to n , and spinorial with respect to h otherwise.

clearly f descends to a matter eld on q if and only if it is vectorial.

in grand unication [10], a given gauge group (usually the standard group) h

is regarded as a subgroup of some larger group g. the objective is to gain some control

over the kinds of matter elds in the theory : only those representations of h which can

be regarded as restrictions of g-representations are accepted. of course, by the peter-

weyl theorem, all h-representations are restrictions of some g-representation, but in

practice one requires the g-representation to be small. in addition, however, grand

unied theories have the eect of ruling out h gauge spinors. for if  is a representation

of eh which does not descend to a representation of h, then there is no sense in which

 can be said to arise from any representation of g. for example, the unbroken gauge

group of the standard model [11] is the unitary group u (3), which is triply covered

by u (1)  su (3). the usual representations [11] of u (3) appearing in the standard

model can all be obtained from (small) su (5) representations, but the opposite is

true of those (spinorial) representations of u (1)  su (3) which do not descend to

7

representations of u (3). the inclusion of matter elds dened by representations of

that kind would defeat the whole point of grand unication.

now it is essential to understand that the gauge groups of (heterotic) string theo-

ries are not grand unication groups in the usual sense; unication in string theory is

much more subtle. consider, for example, either e8 in (e8  e8)  z2. this group has a

maximal, maximal-rank subgroup globally isomorphic to spin(16)/z2. in the fermionic

formulation of the e8 theory, one has sixteen left-handed fermions transforming as the

16 of spin(16)/z2. however, no such representation exists  the 16 is a represen-

tation of spin(16), but not of spin(16)/z2. in other words, these elds are spinorial

with respect to spin(16)/z2. this kind of behaviour, which cannot occur in a true e8

grand unied theory, is of vital importance in string theory. most importantly for our

purposes, when the heterotic theories are compactied on tori or toral orbifolds, the

winding modes [3] which play a crucial role in t-duality are in fact gauge spinors with

respect to certain groups. we shall return to this point below.

in view of these remarks, we need to modify the formalism of the preceding section

to allow for the possibility that g1 and g2 have subgroups which are locally but not

globally isomorphic. that is, the respective subgroups, h1 and h2, are not isomorphic,

but they have the same lie algebra. then there exists a group h  with nite central

subgroups n1 and n2, such that hi = h /ni. (note that h  is not a subgroup of

either g1 or g2, and that it need not be simply connected.) suppose as before that p1

is a principal g1 bundle admitting an h1 subbundle q1. assume now that q1 has a

non-trivial n1 cover q which is an h  bundle over the same base. then q2 = q/n2

is a well-dened h2 bundle, and q2 can be extended as usual to a g2 bundle p2. we

have a pair of bundles reducing to subbundles with a common gauge spinor bundle.

next, let 1 be a connection on p1, and, as in the preceding section, let 1 = h1|q1

be the corresponding connection on q1. pull-backs of connections do not always dene

connections, but, if  denotes the projections  : q  q1,  : h   h1, we have, for

8

any h  h ,

r

h 1 = (  rh)1 =  r

(h)1

= ad((h)) 1 = ad(h) 1,

since n1 is central. thus  1 is indeed a connection on q; it projects naturally

to a connection on q2, and from there it can be extended to p2 as usual. in short, gauge

elds can be freely moved, via q, from one side to the other. matter elds, however,

are dierent.

notice rst that all matter elds on both q1 and q2 can be pulled back to q,

which provides an arena for comparing or exchanging such elds. (this is why it is

more convenient to regard matter elds as equivariant functions on principal bundles

rather than as cross-sections.) however, we may wish to consider matter elds on q

which are not pulled back from either q1 or q2; these will be spinorial with respect

both to h1 and to h2. notice too that elds on q which are vectorial with respect to

h1 can be spinorial with respect to h2, and vice versa; the status of a given eld can

depend on ones point of view. this relativity is an important ingredient of t -duality.

in general, elds on q fall into four sectors : those which are invariant with respect to

both n1 and n2, those which are invariant with respect to one but not the other, and

those which are invariant with respect to neither.

let us now turn to the specic groups involved in heterotic string theory.

4. a global formulation of t-duality

the gauge groups of the heterotic theories are (e8  e8)  z2 and spin(32)/z2.

both of these have subgroups locally isomorphic to so(16)  so(16), but the global

picture is not so simple.

the spin group spin(4m) has a centre of the form [12]

z2  z2 = {1,  k4m},

where k4m covers the so(4m) matrix i4m. of course, we have so(4m) = spin(4m)/{1},

but since ( k4m)2 = 1, we can also dene spin(4m)/{1, k4m}, which diers from

9

so(4m) for all m 6= 2. this is the group usually called spin(4m)/z2, but this no-

tation would be too confusing for our purposes : we shall call it semispin(4m) instead.

the name is motivated by the fact that these are the groups for which the half-spin rep-

resentations [12] are faithful; the fundamental half-spin representation of semispin(4m)

is (22m1)-dimensional.

as was mentioned earlier, e8 contains semispin(16), not so(16) or spin(16).

(the adjoint of e8 decomposes as 248 = 128  120, where the 128 is the half-spinor of

semispin(16), and 120 is its adjoint.) thus (e8  e8)  z2 contains (semispin(16) 

semispin(16))  z2. to see that the z2 factor must be included, note that, for a

discussion of t-duality on a torus, we must break (e8  e8)  z2 by a wilson loop;

the latter breaks a gauge group to the centraliser of some element of the group. now

semispin(16) is the centraliser, in e8, of (1), the projection of 1  spin(16). since

((1), (1)) is clearly invariant under the exchange automorphism, we see that the

centraliser of this element of (e8e8)z2 is indeed (semispin(16)semispin(16))z2.

one might reasonably expect semispin(32), the other heterotic gauge group, to

contain this same subgroup, just as so(32) contains so(16)  so(16). this is not the

case, however. note rst that spin(32) does behave in the expected way : it contains

spin(16)  spin(16), where the dot means that 1 in one spin(16) is identied with

1 in the other. however, upon projecting spin(32) to semispin(32), we obtain [5]

the subgroup

spin(16)

spin(16) = [spin(16)  spin(16)]/(z2  z2),

in which the entire centre of one spin(16) is identied with that of the other. (we shall

denote the elements of this group by a

b, for a, b  spin(16).) again, for wilson-

loop breaking on a torus we wish to express spin(16)

spin(16) as a centraliser, but this

cannot be done; instead, the semispin(32) centraliser of k16



1 is isomorphic to

(spin(16)

spin(16))  z2,

where z2 acts by exchanging the two local spin(16) factors [5]. thus we see that

10

the relevant subgroups of (e8  e8)  z2 and semispin(32) are locally but not globally

isomorphic.

before moving on, let us note the following. the groups (e8  e8)  z2 and

semispin(32) exhibit topological complications of two very dierent kinds : one is

disconnected, the other non-simply-connected. yet their so(16)  so(16) subgroups

are much more similar. this similarity, which is so crucial to t-duality, is however

very delicately dependent on the dierences between spin(4m) and semispin(4m). on

the one hand, e8  e8 contains a non-simply-connected subgroup because e8 contains

semispin(16) and not spin(16). on the other hand, the other subgroup is discon-

nected because the gauge group is semispin(32) and not spin(32). by this we mean

the following : a theorem of bott [13] states that the centraliser of any element of a

connected, compact, simply connected lie group must be connected. indeed, the cen-

traliser of k16  1 in spin(32) is the connected group spin(16)  spin(16). in this sense,

(spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 is disconnected (like (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2)

because semispin(32) is not simply connected. thus the apparently opposite topo-

logical complications of the two heterotic gauge groups are unied by t-duality. this

general fact was made explicit in the case of the chl compactications [14] by the

work of lerche et al [4] who show that the moduli space of at connections in the t 2

compactication of the semispin(32) heterotic string has two connected components

(because semispin(32) is not simply connected), and so does the moduli space of at

connections in the t 2 compactication of the (e8  e8)  z2 string ( because this group

is not connected). the chl compactications on each side then correspond to the ex-

tra components of the moduli spaces. in general, we should always expect phenomena

associated with the fact that semispin(32) is not simply connected to be related in

some way to phenomena associated with the fact that (e8  e8)  z2 is not connected.

we shall return to this later.

let us now apply the formalism of the preceding section to the case at hand. our

objective is to construct a semispin(32) bundle p1 admitting a (spin(16)

spin(16))z2

11

subbundle q1, such that q1 lifts to an h  bundle q, which in turn projects to a

(semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2 bundle q2. our rst objective is of course to

identify the group h . for simplicity, let us temporarily dispense with the z2 factors.

since spin(16)

spin(16) and semispin(16) semispin(16) are locally isomorphic,

they have the same universal covering group, namely spin(16)  spin(16). this is

denitely not a good choice for h , however, both for mathematical reasons and, more

importantly, physical ones. let q1 be a principal spin(16)

spin(16) bundle admitting

a non-trivial z2  z2 cover q which is a spin(16)  spin(16) bundle over the same

base. then q/{(1, 1), (1, 1)} is a spin(16)  spin(16) bundle, and so, spin(16) 

spin(16) being a subgroup of spin(32), this bundle can be extended to a spin(32)

bundle. thus, if we take h  = spin(16)spin(16), we are ruling out any semispin(32)

conguration which fails to lift to a spin(32) conguration. however, it is known

that t-duality cannot work without semispin(32) gauge elds of this kind : berkooz

et al [6] show that the dmw models [15] for the (e8  e8)  z2 theory are t-dual

to such semispin(32) congurations. clearly it is necessary to nd some h  which

is a double (rather than quadruple) cover of both semispin(16)  semispin(16) and

spin(16)

spin(16). notice that it is not obvious that such a group exists  for example,

semispin(16)  semispin(16) and so(16)  so(16) have no common cover other than

spin(16)  spin(16).

there are in fact no fewer than 22 distinct connected groups locally isomorphic to

spin(16)  spin(16). of these, however, only ve have fundamental groups isomorphic

to z2, namely so(16)  spin(16), semispin(16)  spin(16), spin(16)  spin(16), a

certain group dened by identifying 1 in one spin(16) with k16 in another, and

spin(16)  spin(16), dened by identifying k16 in one spin(16) with k16 in the

other : that is,

spin(16)  spin(16) = (spin(16)  spin(16))/{(1, 1), ( k16, k16)}.

it is not dicult to show that none of the rst four candidates covers both semispin(16)

12

semispin(16) and spin(16)

spin(16). but we have

semispin(16)  semispin(16) = (spin(16)  spin(16))/{(1  1), ( k16  1},

spin(16)

spin(16) = (spin(16)  spin(16))/{(1  1), (1)  (1)}.

thus, spin(16)  spin(16) double-covers both groups, and it is the unique (connected)

physically acceptable candidate for h . (as spin(16)  spin(16) is symmetrical be-

tween the two factors, we can dene (spin(16)  spin(16))  z2 in the obvious way;

and since k16  1 and (1)  (1) are invariant under the action of z2, it is clear

that (spin(16)  spin(16))  z2 double-covers (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2 and

(spin(16)

spin(16))  z2.)

the framework for any global formulation of the t -duality between the heterotic

string theories is therefore as follows. we can begin with a semispin(32) bundle p1

admitting a (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 subbundle q1. we assume that q1 has a non-

trivial double cover q which is a (spin(16)  spin(16))  z2 bundle over the same

base. on q we will have certain matter elds, including winding modes which may be

gauge spinors from the semispin(32) point of view. but let q2 = q/{1  1, k16  1}.

then q2 is a (semispin(16))  (semispin(16))  z2 bundle over the same base as q1,

and q2 may be regarded as a subbundle of an (e8  e8)  z2 bundle p2. the matter

elds on q can again be interpreted as vectorial or spinorial (e8  e8)  z2 matter

elds. the crucial point is that all of the matter (and gauge) elds live on the same

manifold, q, and it therefore makes sense to speak of mapping one to another under

t -duality. furthermore, since the status of a given matter eld on q (as a gauge

vector or a gauge spinor) is dependent on whether one takes the semispin(32) or the

(e8  e8)  z2 point of view, the characteristic exchange of winding with non-winding

modes can be easily accommodated. finally, the assumption that q exists, to which

we must of course return, in no way requires p1 to lift to a spin(32) bundle, and so we

can handle dm w -like congurations.

some concrete examples may be helpful. the adjoint of semispin(32) coincides

with that of so(32), which decomposes under so(16)  so(16) as 496 = (16, 16) 

13

(120, 1)  (1, 120), where 120 is the adjoint of so(16). the tensor product (16, 16)

is a legitimate representation of spin(16)

spin(16), though (16, 1)  (1, 16) would

not be; for (i16, i16)  so(16)  so(16) is in the kernel of (16, 16) but not that

of (16, 1)  (1, 16), while k16





k16, the corresponding element of spin(16)

spin(16),

equals the identity. a matter eld f1 on q taking its values in (16, 16) is therefore a

gauge vector from the semispin(32) point of view. on the other hand, a matter eld

h1 on q taking its values in the half-spin representation (128, 1)  (1, 128) (which is

a legitimate representation of spin(16)  spin(16)) will satisfy

h1  r(1)(1) = h1,

where rg denotes the action of g  spin(16)  spin(16) on q, so h1 is a gauge spinor

for semispin(32); such elds will arise as winding modes when the corresponding string

theory is compactied on a torus. from the e8  e8 side, we can also have a gauge

vector h2 taking its values in (128, 1)  (1, 128) (this being a legitimate representa-

tion of semispin(16)  semispin(16)) and a winding mode  a gauge spinor  f2,

taking its values in (16, 16) (which is a representation of spin(16)  spin(16) but

not of semispin(16)  semispin(16)).

in addition, we can have matter elds g1, g2

from both sides, taking values in (120, 1)  (1, 120); as this is a representation of both

spin(16)

spin(16) and semispin(16)semispin(16), g1 and g2 are gauge vectors from

both points of view. (the same would be true of matter elds, if any, taking values in

(128, 128).) then t -duality acts by exchanging f1  f2, g1  g2, h1  h2, and so

on. the details need not concern us here : the point is that we now have a meaningful

global formulation of t -duality. that is, the elds being exchanged live on the same

manifold, q, and they take values in the same representations  despite the fact that

some of these representations do not make sense for the original groups obtained by

wilson-loop breaking of (e8  e8)  z2 and semispin(32). the fact that the respective

so(16)  so(16) subgroups are not isomorphic leads to an ambiguity in the vec-

tor/spinor status of matter elds  but this ambiguity proves to be nothing but a facet

of t -duality.

14

one question remains, however : does q actually exist?

5. existence of gauge spin structures.

the t -duality of the two heterotic theories was originally formulated on r9  s1,

where sn denotes the n-sphere. on this manifold, every spin(16)

spin(16) princi-

pal bundle lifts to a spin(16)  spin(16) bundle, and so does every semispin(16) 

semispin(16) bundle. the programme outlined in the preceding section can therefore

be completed : every spin(16)

spin(16) conguration is t -dual to some semispin(16)

semispin(16) conguration over r9  s1.

recently, attempts have been made (most notably in ref.[6]) to formulate t -duality

on more complicated manifolds, particularly k3. evidently, the above lifting problems

will be more complex in these cases.

let p be any (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 bundle over a manifold m . then the

bration (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2  p  m yields the exact sequence [12]

0  h 0(m, z2)  h 0(p, z2)  h 0((spin(16)

spin(16))  z2, z2)  h 1(m, z2),

where h i(x, z2) is the ith cohomology group of x with z2 coecients. clearly

h 0((spin(16)

spin(16))  z2, z2) has a non-trivial element; let us call it j 

16. if fp is

the last homomorphism in the exact sequence, we dene

x1(p ) = fp (j 

16)  h 1(m, z2).

if (and only if) x1(p ) = 0, then by the exactness of the above sequence, h 0(p, z2) 6= 0,

that is, p is disconnected. then p can be reduced to a spin(16)

spin(16) subbundle.

this is of course the analogue of orientability for this group.

suppose that x1(p ) = 0, so that, in eect, p is a spin(16)

spin(16) bundle. the

bration spin(16)

spin(16)  p  m yields [12] another exact sequence,

0  h 1(m, z2)  h 1(p, z2)  h 1(spin(16)

spin(16), z2)  h 2(m, z2).

15

now spin(16)

spin(16) is dened by factoring spin(16)  spin(16) by its subgroup

{(1, 1), (1, 1), ( k16, k16), ( k16,  k16)}. hence we can regard this as the funda-

mental group of spin(16)

spin(16), and, since it is isomorphic to z2  z2, this is also

h 1(spin(16)

spin(16), z2). thus, again denoting the last homomorphism in the exact

sequence by fp , we dene

w2(p ) = fp (( k16, k16))  h 2(m, z2),

x2(p ) = fp ((1, 1))  h 2(m, z2).

(since spin(16)spin(16) has an outer automorphism mapping ( k16, k16) to ( k16,  k16),

fp (( k16,  k16)) gives nothing new.) now we have the following isomorphisms, in

which the notation is self-explanatory.

spin(16)

spin(16) = (spin(16)  spin(16))/{1  1, k16  k16}

= (spin(16)  spin(16))/{1  1, (1)  (1)}.

furthermore, h 1(p, z2) describes the possible non-trivial double covers of p . the

exactness of the above sequence therefore implies that if w2(p ) = 0, then p has a non-

trivial double cover p which is a spin(16)  spin(16) bundle over m . if p is regarded

as a subbundle of a semispin(32) bundle, then the latter will have a non-trivial double

cover which is a spin(32) bundle over m . in such a case one says [6] that p has a

vector structure. (notice that the problem is really to lift semispin(32) to spin(32);

the projection from spin(32) to so(32), which motivates the terminology, can always

be done.) thus w2(p ) is just the generalised stiefel-whitney class [6] which obstructs

the existence of vector structures.

in the same way, x2(p ) = 0 means that p has another non-trivial double cover

p  , which is a spin(16)  spin(16) bundle over m . we shall say in this case that

p admits an exceptional structure, because p /{1  1, k16  1} is a semispin(16) 

semispin(16) bundle which can be extended to an e8  e8 bundle.

we can now complete our global formulation of heterotic t -duality. we begin with

a semispin(32) bundle p1 admitting a (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 subbundle q1. we

16

require

x2(q1) = 0.

let q be a non-trivial double cover of q1 with structural group (spin(16)  spin(16)) 

z2. then q is automatically a non-trivial double cover of a certain (semispin(16) 

semispin(16))  z2 bundle q2 = q/{1  1, k16  1}, which may be regarded as a

subbundle of an (e8  e8)  z2 bundle p2. as explained in the preceding section, q is

the arena for the exchanges dening t -duality.

several remarks should be made at this point. the rst and most important is that

the condition x2(q1) = 0 will not, of course, always be satised for all base manifolds

m .

it is satised for all bundles over r9  s1, since h 2(r9  s1, z2) = 0, but on

more complex manifolds we can certainly nd semispin(32) congurations such that

q1 does not lift to any q.

in such a case, the conguration has no globally well-

dened e8  e8 partner : we can say that there is a topological obstruction to t-duality.

this is a failure of t -duality (see ref.

[16]) which would pass undetected at the local

level. notice that x2 and w2 take values in the same cohomology group, so one must

beware of this possibility in any situation in which the existence of a vector structure is

questionable. on the other hand, the two obstructions are independent : the existence

of a vector structure in no way guarantees the existence of an exceptional structure or

vice versa. (the existence of two obstruction classes is of course due to the greater

topological complexity of spin(16)

spin(16) compared with so(32) or semispin(32).)

secondly, we have throughout assumed that one begins with a semispin(32) bundle

and works towards (e8  e8)  z2. however, one is entitled to begin with an

(e8  e8)  z2 bundle p2 admitting a (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2 subbundle

q2. there is an element y1(q2)  h 1(m, z2) which obstructs the reduction of q2 to a

semispin(16)  semispin(16) bundle. assuming that y1(q2) = 0 and again calling the

reduced bundle q2, we can ask whether q2 lifts to a spin(16)  spin(16) bundle q;

the obstruction is a certain element y2(q2)  h 2(m, z2). if indeed y2(q2) = 0, then

17

q exists, and we can dene

q1 = q/{1  1, (1)  (1)},

a spin(16)

spin(16) bundle, and so t-duality goes through. we stress that w2, x2, and

y2 are all distinct from each other and from the standard stiefel-whitney class w2. the

latter would be relevant to the study of so(16)  so(16) bundles lifting to

spin(16)  spin(16) bundles; this may not seem to be directly relevant, since so(16 

so(16) is not a subgroup of either of the heterotic gauge groups. however, w2 also

governs the lifting of [so(16)  so(16)]/z2 bundles to spin(16)

spin(16) bundles (see

the diagram in ref. [5]) and so, since [so(16)so(16)]/z2 is contained in the projective

special orthogonal group p so(32), and the latter is the structural group of the chan-

paton bundles of open string theory, w2 is important in type i theory (and possibly in

establishing the s-duality of type i with the heterotic semispin(32) theory [17].)

notice that the vanishing of the obstructions x2 and y2 does not in itself suce to

establish t-duality. if q1 and q2 are bundles with x2(q1) = y2(q2) = 0, then both q1

and q2 have non-trivial (spin(16)  spin(16))  z2 double covers, but these covers need

not be the same. if they are dierent, then t-duality cannot be implemented. this is

why we insist that if q1 is a (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 bundle with

x2(q2) = 0, and q is the corresponding double cover, then q/{1  1, k16  1} is the

t-dual (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2 bundle; for this bundle obviously does have

q as a double cover. (obviously y2(q/{1  1, k16  1}) = 0, so x2 and y2 are related

in this limited sense.)

finally, there can be additional complications if the rst cohomology group h 1(m, z2)

does not vanish.

it follows from the second exact sequence above that if q1 is a

(spin(16)

spin(16)) z2 bundle with x2(q1) = 0, then the double cover q need not be

unique: the number of possibilities is counted by |h 1(m, z2)|, the order of h 1(m, z2).

strictly speaking, then, we must label the various (spin(16)spin(16)) z2 bundles q
i ,

where i = 1    |h 1(m, z2)|, corresponding to a given q1. the winding modes might

18

then fall into topological sectors labelled by i. (for toral compactications, one might

interpret these gauge spin structures in terms of boundary conditions.) the problem

now is that, in general, the (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2 bundles

q

i /{1  1, k16  1}, i = 1    |h 1(m, z2)|,

will not be mutually isomorphic. this would mean that a certain given semispin(32)

conguration might be t-dual not to one but rather to a whole collection of

(e8e8)z2 congurations. (note that requiring h 1(m, z2) = 0 would be very drastic,

as it would rule out most manifolds with nite fundamental groups of even order.) this

situation can be avoided only by conning all winding modes to the same gauge spin

bundle.

we may summarise as follows. the fact that the so(16)  so(16) subgroups of

the heterotic string gauge groups are not mutually isomorphic is not a problem in itself;

indeed, it plays a key role in t-duality. on the other hand, it also imposes topological

conditions. if we begin on the semispin(32) side, this condition is that the reduced

gauge bundle q1 must admit an exceptional structure, which means that a certain

cohomology class x2(q1), analogous to (but dierent from) the second stiefel-whitney

class, must vanish. if x2(q1) 6= 0, then t-duality is topologically obstructed.

let us consider some simple examples of these phenomena.

6. examples.

there are of course many ways of constructing principal bre bundles exhibiting

various kinds of topological non-triviality, but here we shall concentrate on three ap-

proaches which are particularly relevant to string theory. all are straightforward and

explicit.

a. embedding the spin connection in the gauge group

the traditional method of constructing gauge vacua in string theory [18] is mo-

tivated by the need to cancel anomalies. the curvature tensor of the compactication

19

manifold is equated to the gauge eld strength, a procedure known as embedding

the spin connection in the gauge group. (one should not be misled by the terminology

: in the physics literature, the spin connection usually means the components of the

levi-civita connection with respect to an orthonormal basis. globally, it could mean

either the levi-civita connection form or its pull-back to a spin bundle over the bundle

of orthonormal frames.) let us examine the use of this technique in constructing various

non-trivial semispin(32) and e8  e8 bundles.

an important string compactication manifold is the four-dimensional k3 space

[19]. this manifold admits a ricci-at riemannian metric. let so(k3) be a bundle

of oriented orthonormal frames over k3 (which is orientable). then so(k3) is an

so(4) bundle. as k3 is a ricci-at kahler manifold, so(k3) can be reduced to an

su (2) subbundle su (k3); however, su (k3) need not be stable under the action of

the (nite, but possibly non-trivial) group of isometries of k3, so it is preferable to use

so(k3). this means that we should embed su (2) in the gauge group through some

natural embedding of either so(4) or (if indeed we wish to use a spin connection in the

true sense) of spin(4).

in fact, both so(4) and spin(4) have natural embeddings in spin(16)

spin(16),

as follows. first, spin(4) is a subgroup of spin(16) in the obvious way, so the subgroup

{a

1}, a  spin(4),

is isomorphic to spin(4). on the other hand, since clearly (1)

(1) = 1

1, we see

that

{a

a}, a  spin(4),

is isomorphic to so(4). let us concentrate rst on this latter case, and determine the

structure of the covers of so(4) in spin(16)  spin(16) and spin(16)  spin(16). we

have

(1)  (1) = 1  1,

(1)  (1) 6= 1  1.

20

thus {a  a}, the cover of so(4) in spin(16)  spin(16), is still (perhaps surprisingly)

isomorphic to so(4), whereas {a  a}, the cover in spin(16)  spin(16), is isomorphic

to spin(4). now take so(k3), and extend it in the usual way to a spin(16)

spin(16)

bundle. (we shall ignore the disconnected version, since h 1(k3, z2) = 0 and so x1(q) =

0 for all (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 bundles over k3.) that is, dene

q(so(k3)) = [so(k3)  spin(16)

spin(16)]/so(4),

with so(4) acting to the left on spin(16)

spin(16) as usual. we can dene a semispin(32)

bundle p (so(k3)) in the same way. the levi-civita connection corresponding to a

ricci-at metric on k3 can be regarded as a connection one-form on so(k3), and

it pushes forward to a gauge eld on q(so(k3)) and p (so(k3)); the gauge eld

strength will coincide with the curvature form of k3; in short, we have embedded the

spin (actually, the levi-civita) connection in the gauge group, semispin(32).

now set

q(so(k3)) = [so(k3)  spin(16)  spin(16)]/so(4).

clearly q(so(k3)) is a spin(16)spin(16) bundle over k3, and it can be extended to a

spin(32) bundle. now so(4), as a subgroup of spin(32), does not contain k16  k16 =

k32, and so in fact

q(so(k3))/{1, k32} = q(so(k3)).

that is, q(so(k3)) is a non-trivial double cover of q(so(k3)); it is a vector structure.

we have

w2(q(so(k3))) = 0.

thus, embedding the levi-civita connection is semispin(32) always yields a semispin(32)

conguration with a vector structure.

the k3 manifold is a spin manifold, that is, so(k3) has a non-trivial double cover

spin(k3) which is a spin(4) bundle over k3. (this spin structure is unique). as the

21

so(4) subgroup of semispin(32) is covered by spin(4) in spin(16)  spin(16), we can

dene

q(so(k3)) = [spin(k3)  spin(16)  spin(16)]/spin(4),

and this is a spin(16)  spin(16) bundle over k3. as spin(4) does contain (1)  (1),

we have

q(so(k3))/{1  1, (1)  (1)} = q(so(k3)),

so that q(so(k3)) is another non-trivial double cover of q(so(k3)). evidently

x2(q(so(k3))) = 0,

that is, embedding the levi-civita connection of k3 in semispin(32) yields a con-

guration with an exceptional structure. thus, this conguration is globally t-dual to

an e8  e8 conguration

q(so(k3))/{1  1, k16  1} =

[spin(k3)  semispin(16)  semispin(16)]/spin(4).

an alternative procedure is to use, instead of the levi-civita connection, the spin

connection in the true sense  that is, the pull-back of the levi-civita connection

to spin(k3). embedding spin(4) in spin(16)  spin(16) as {a

1}, we see that the

covers of spin(4) in spin(16)  spin(16) and spin(16)  spin(16) are both isomorphic

to spin(4). if therefore we dene

q(spin(k3)) = [spin(k3)  spin(16)

spin(16)]/spin(4),

then q(spin(k3)) is a principal spin(16)

spin(16) bundle over k3 with non-trivial

double covers

q(spin(k3)) = [spin(k3)  spin(16)  spin(16)]/spin(4),

q(spin(k3)) = [spin(k3)  spin(16)  spin(16)]/spin(4),

and so q(spin(k3)) is another semispin(32) conguration with both vector and ex-

ceptional structures. notice that, although embedding the levi-civita connection

22

and embedding the spin connection both lead to semispin(32) congurations pos-

sessing both vector and exceptional structures, the two procedures are indeed quite

dierent. a useful way to show this is to note that the levi-civita connection breaks

spin(16)

spin(16) to [su (2)  spin(12)]

[su (2)  spin(12)] (since this is the cen-

traliser of su (2) with this embedding), while the spin connection breaks it to

[su (2)  spin(12)]

spin(16).

apart from k3, the only known examples of compact ricci-at riemannian four-

dimensional manifolds are the at manifolds and the enriques [20] and hitchin [21]

manifolds. the enriques manifold is a kahler manifold of the form k3/z2, while the

hitchin manifold is a non-kahler manifold, k3/[z2 z2]. neither has attracted as much

interest as k3, partly because neither is a spin manifold; see ref. [22] for a discussion

of this fact. (as a general rule, it is dicult for compact, locally irreducible, ricci-at

manifolds of dimension n = 4r to be spin if they are not simply connected. no example is

known for n = 4 or 12, and the only known examples for n = 8 have fundamental groups

isomorphic to z2.) however, pope et al [23] have argued that non-spin manifolds can

be of interest in string theory when winding modes are taken into account; for example,

the ads5  s1  cp 2 solution of iia supergravity generates an acceptable bps solution

of the full string theory, despite the fact that cp 2 is not a spin manifold. furthermore,

the enriques and hitchin manifolds fail to be spin in a relatively innocuous way. to

explain this remark, we note rst that, like all orientable four-dimensional manifolds

[24], the enriques manifold k3/z2 and the hitchin manifold k3/(z2  z2) are both

spinc manifolds. this essentially means that diculties in constructing globally well-

dened fermion elds can be overcome by coupling to a specic u (1) gauge eld. for

the enriques and hitchin manifolds, this u (1) eld is particularly inconspicuous because

its eld strength vanishes; hence it does not aect the lagrangian or the formula for

the square of the dirac operator. in view of all this, we suggest that these manifolds

may repay further investigation.

if we let so(k3/z2) be a bundle of orthonormal frames over the enriques manifold,

23

then with the above embedding of so(4) in spin(16)

spin(16) we can dene

q(so(k3/z2)) = [so(k3/z2)  spin(16)

spin(16)]/so(4).

one easily prove, in the same way as for k3, that

w2(q(so(k3/z2))) = 0,

so we still have a vector structure in this case. but if q(so(k3/z2)) had a non-trivial

spin(16)  spin(16) cover, then so(k3/z2) would have a non-trivial spin(4) double

cover, and we know that this is not the case. hence

x2(q(so(k3/z2))) 6= 0,

and so q(so(k3/z2)) is our rst example of a semispin(32) conguration with a vector

structure but without an exceptional structure. precisely similar statements hold true

of the hitchin manifold:

w2(q(so(k3/(z2  z2)))) = 0,

x2(q(so(k3/(z2  z2)))) 6= 0.

in short, embedding the levi-civita connections of these ricci-at manifolds in

semispin(32) leads to congurations with no global t-dual partners. this behaviour

is best explained in terms of holonomy [25]. the linear holonomy group of the hitchin

manifold (endowed with a yau metric descending [26] from the universal cover) is

(q8  su (2))/z2, where q8 is the quaternion group of order 8, and so this is the

holonomy group of the gauge connection on q(so(k3/z2  z2))). if the latter had an

exceptional structure, then the holonomy group of the pull-back connection would be

q8  su (2). however, it is impossible for a holonomy group to have eight connected

components over a manifold with z2  z2 as fundamental group. a similar argument

explains the failure of t-duality for q(so(k3/z2)).

t-duality can, however, be implemented on these manifolds if we exploit their

spinc structures. recall [12] that oriented riemannian manifold m is said to have a

24

spinc structure if there exists a u (1) bundle l(m ) over m such that so(m ) + l(m )

has a non-trivial double cover spinc(m ) which is a spinc(n) bundle over m . here

n = dimm , spinc(n) = (spin(n)  u (1))/z2, and so(m ) + l(m ) is the submanifold

of so(m )l(m ) consisting of pairs (s, t) such that s and t project to the same point in

m . (thus so(m )+l(m ) is an so(n)u (1) bundle over m ; while so(m )l(m ) is a

bundle over m  m .) clearly, spinc structures are rarely unique when they exist, since

there may be many choices for l(m ). for kahler manifolds, however, there is a natural

choice : take a bundle of unitary frames u (m ), and set l(m ) = u (m )/su (n/2), where

n is the real dimension of m . for the enriques manifold, which is kahlerian, this u (1)

bundle inherits from u (m ) a connection with holonomy z2. the curvature is therefore

zero, and so the spinc structure can be employed without changing any local structures.

the hitchin manifold is not kahlerian, but for it, too, there is a canonical choice of

l(m ), and again l(m ) has a at connection, (even with l(m ) xed, however, there

is still the usual source of ambiguity in dening spinc(m ), namely h 1(m, z2).)

let us consider, then, the bundles so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2) and

so(k3/(z2  z2)) + l(k3/(z2  z2)). both are so(4)  so(2) bundles over the

respective base manifolds. now so(4)  so(2) is a subgroup of so(6), and the latter

embeds naturally in spin(16)

spin(16), as {a

a, a  spin(6)}. hence we can dene

q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2))

= [(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2))  spin(16)

spin(16)]/(so(4)  so(2)),

and similarly for q(so(k3/(z2  z2))) + l(k3/(z2  z2))). the levi-civita con-

nection form on so(k3/z2), and the canonical at connection form on l(k3/z2),

both pull back to so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2), and their direct sum denes [1] a connec-

tion there. this connection pushes forward to a connection on the spin(16)

spin(16)

bundle q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2)) and to the latters semispin(32) extension.

it is easy to see that, since so(4)  so(2) is covered in spin(16)  spin(16) by

a subgroup which is again isomorphic to so(4)  so(2), q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2))

25

and q(so(k3/(z2  z2)) + l(k3/(z2  z2))) both have vector structures:

w2(q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2))) = 0,

w2(q(so(k3/(z2  z2)) + l(k3/(z2  z2)))) = 0.

now, however, let spinc(k3/z2) and spinc(k3/(z2  z2)) denote spinc structures

over the respective manifolds. then

q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2))

= [spinc(k3/z2)  spin(16)  spin(16)]/spin(4)  spin(2)

is well-dened, spin(4)spin(2) being the cover of so(4)so(2) in spin(16)spin(16),

and similarly for k3/(z2  z2). (through this discussion we have used the elementary

isomorphisms [27] u (1) = so(2) = spin(2).). that is,

x2(q(so(k3/z2) + l(k3/z2))) = 0

x2(q(so(k3/(z2  z2)) + l(k3/(z2  z2)))) = 0;

both of these spin(16)

spin(16) bundles have exceptional structures.

who wishes to investigate these congurations should note that while, for example,

the holonomy groups of the connections on so(k3/z2) and l(k3/z2) are isomorphic

respectively to [z4su (2)]/z2 and z2, the holonomy group of the direct sum connection

on so(k3/z2)+l(k3/z2) is not z2[z4su (2)]/z2. rather, it is again isomorphic to

[z4  su (2)]/z2. see ref.[1], page 82. the corresponding connection on spinc(k3/z2)

also has holonomy [z4  su (2)]/z2, not z4  su (2).)

we conclude, then, that if the levi-civita connections of the (ricci-at) enriques

and hitchin manifolds are embedded in semispin(32), we obtain congurations with

no globally well-dened t-dual partners, even though both do have vector structures.

on the other hand, by exploiting the spinc structures of these spaces, one can con-

struct a dierent pair of semispin(32) bundles which do admit t-dual partners. it is

interesting to note here that the argument of pope et al [23], to the eect that non-spin

manifolds are acceptable in string compactications, depends on the existence of spinc

structures and on the application of t-duality.

26

six-dimensional ricci-at kahler manifolds present fewer complications, because

(in the compact case) these are always spin whether they are simply connected or

not. embedding so(6) in spin(16)

spin(16) as {a

a, a  spin(6)}, we can extend

so(cy ), for a calabi-yau manifold cy , to a spin(16)

spin(16) bundle q(so(cy ));

such a bundle always has a vector structure, and, if spin(cy ) is a spin structure over

cy , we can use it to construct an exceptional structure. alternatively, by embedding

spin(6) in spin(16)

spin(16) in the obvious way, we can use any spin structure over

cy to construct q(spin(cy )), which again has both vector and exceptional structures.

(as in the case of k3, so(cy ) and spin(cy ) are reducible bundles, but we avoid using

the reduced bundles because they need not be mapped into themselves by isometries.

indeed, we should actually use a sub-bundle of the full bundle of orthonormal frames,

o(cy ). see ref.

[28] for a discussion of this point.) we remind the reader that

spin(cy ) will not be unique if, as is frequently the case, h 1(cy, z2) does not vanish.

if more than one spin structure is physically signicant, then embedding the levi-

civita or spin connections in semispin(32) will produce congurations which are t-

dual to a family of apparently distinct (e8  e8)  z2 congurations. (recall that

we are using the term t-duality in a very broad way in this work, to include any

process of exchanging the gauge and matter elds of the two heterotic theories. such

an exchange or comparison could be of interest even if t-duality in the more restricted

sense (involving inversions of radii or other changes of moduli) cannot be implemented,

which is apparently the case for calabi-yau compactications [16]).

b. examples from abelian instantons.

gauge congurations with non-vanishing invariants such as w2 or x2 are of course

topologically non-trivial. one of the simplest but physically most relevant ways to

construct such elds is to use the non-trivial u (1) bundles over the two-sphere (abelian

instantons). these arise naturally when the singularities of orbifolds are blown up [6].

throughout this section, the base manifold is either a two-cycle in some manifold, or a

two-sphere around an orbifold singularity. the construction is guided by the discussions

27

in sections 4 and 5 of ref. [6].

recall that so(16) contains the unitary group u (8), which is globally isomorphic

to [u (1)  su (8)]/z8. the corresponding subgroup of spin(16) is isomorphic [5] to

[u (1)  su (8)]/z4. we denote the elements of the latter by [u, s]4, so that [iu, s]4 =

[u, is]4 and so on. now let j8 be the element of spin(16) dened by

j8 = [i, i8]4;

it projects to the so(16) matrix


0 i8

i8

0

can show [5] that ( j8)2 = k16. notice that j8 is contained in the u (1) subgroup


 where i8 is the 8  8 identity matrix. one

u (1)j = {[u, i8]4, u  u (1)}.

next, let z be a primitive sixteenth root of unity, so that the matrix diag(z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z)

is an element of su (8), and so

l8 = [z1, diag(z, z, z, z, z, z, z, z)]4

is an element of [u (1)  su (8)]/z4. notice that ( l8)2 is [z2, z2i8]4, which projects to

i8 in u (8), and so ( l8)2 = 1  spin(16). clearly l8 is contained in

u (1)l = {[u1, diag(u7, u, u, u, u, u, u, u)]4, u  u (1)}.

thus, u (1)j and u (1)l are commuting u (1) subgroups of [u (1)  su (8)]/z4 and hence

of spin(16). if we dene

(u (1)j

(u (1)l



u (1)j ) = {u

u  spin(16)

spin(16), u  u (1)j },



u (1)l) = {u

u  spin(16)

spin(16), u  u (1)l},

then we obtain a pair of commuting u (1) subgroups of semispin(32). let hj , hl be

bundles over the (same) two-sphere, both isomorphic to the hopf bundle [29], and with

(u (1)j



u (1)j ) and (u (1)l



u (1)l), respectively, as structural groups. note that,

28

because (u (1)j



u (1)j ) and (u (1)l



u (1)l) commute, hj + hl is a well-dened

u (1)  u (1) bundle. let q(hj ), q(hl), and q(hj + hl) be the spin(16)

spin(16)

extensions of these bundles. then q(hj ) is essentially the bundle without a vector struc-

ture discussed in section 4 of ref.[6]. this bundle does have an exceptional structure,

however, as we shall soon prove; so t-duality is valid for q(hj ).

let us consider q(hl). if g is any lie group with a non-trivial double cover then

the pre-image of any u (1) in g can be isomorphic either to u (1) or to z2  u (1).

since the non-trivial element of the kernel of the projection spin(16)  spin(16) 

spin(16)

spin(16) is (1)  (1), we see that this projection induces a non-trivial

covering of (u (1)l



u (1)l) if and only if 1  u (1)l, which is indeed the case since

u (1)l contains l8 and ( l8)2 = 1. now it follows that if x2(q(hl)) = 0, so that

q(hl) has a non-trivial (double) spin(16)  spin(16) cover, then hl has a non-trivial

double cover. but this is not the case; the hopf bundle has no square root [29]. thus, in

fact, q(hl) has no exceptional structure : t-duality is topologically obstructed for this

semispin(32) gauge conguration. on the other hand, since u (1) has a unique element

of order 2, we see that u (1)l does not contain k16, and so, since k16  k16 is the non-

trivial element of the kernel of the projection spin(16)spin(16)  spin(16)

spin(16),

the pre-image of (u (1)l



u (1)l) in spin(16)spin(16) is isomorphic to z2 u (1). we

can therefore construct a spin(16)spin(16) non-trivial double cover of q(hl), despite

the fact that hl has no square root. thus q(hl) has a vector structure. arguing in

the same way, one shows that the opposite statements are true of q(hj ); for u (1)j

contains j8 and therefore k16(cid:18)=(cid:16) j8(cid:17)2(cid:19), while it does not contain 1.

finally, notice that if (hj , hl) is any element of hj +hl, then the maps (hj , hl) 

hj , (hj , hl)  hl are bundle homomorphisms onto hj and hl respectively, and so

coverings of q(hj +hl) yield coverings of q(hj ) and q(hl). thus if q(hj +hl) had

a vector structure, so would q(hj ), and if q(hj + hl) had an exceptional structure,

so would q(hl). hence in fact q(hj +hl) yields an example of a semispin(32) gauge

conguration with neither a vector structure nor an exceptional structure. in summary,

29

we have

w2(q(hj )) 6= 0; x2(q(hj)) = 0;

w2(q(hl)) = 0; x2(q(hl)) 6= 0;

w2(q(hj + hl)) 6= 0; x2(q(hj + hl)) 6= 0.

in a similar way, let u (1)e be a u (1) subgroup of semispin(16) containing j 

8 , the
projection of j8, and let he be a hopf bundle with u (1)e as structural group. extend

in spin(16)  spin(16) must be isomorphic to u (1), since (j 

he to a semispin(16)  semispin(16) bundle q(he). then the pre-image of u (1)e
8 , 1) is covered by j8  1,
which squares to k16  1, the non-trivial element of the kernel of spin(16)  spin(16) 

semispin(16)  semispin(16). we conclude that q(he) is an e8  e8 conguration

with no t-dual partner; that is, y2(q(he)) 6= 0.

c. examples involving orbifolds.

t-duality was, of course, originally dened with respect to tori; however, one can

attempt to extend it to other manifolds (such as k3) by regarding them as desingu-

larisations of orbifolds.

it is shown in ref.[6] that abelian instantons can hide in

the singularities of t 4/z2, where t 4 is the four-torus. by blowing up the singularities,

one can if necessary bring the hidden instantons into the open, and the techniques of

the preceding section can be applied. the most striking examples of this kind have a

hidden instanton which is a semispin(32) conguration similar to q(hj ) above : it has

no vector structure, but it does have an exceptional structure, and it is shown in ref.

[6] that it is t-dual to the e8  e8 dmw vacuum [15]. (in fact, the dmw vacuum

is completely symmetric with respect to the two e8 factors, and the gauge group is

actually (e8  e8)  z2, so this is a case where (see section 5 above) y1 6= 0.)

other vacua considered in ref.[6] do have vector structures, but some of these do

not have exceptional structures. before discussing these, however, we must clarify the

following point, rst mentioned in ref.

[6]. when discussing t-duality on r9  s1,

one often begins with unbroken semispin(32), and continuously turns on a wilson

30

line that breaks semispin(32) to (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2. then t-duality converts

this to a (semispin(16)  semispin(16))  z2 theory, which becomes an (e8  e8)  z2

theory when the wilson line is continuously turned o. however, it is intuitively

clear that if we insist that it should always be possible to turn wilson lines on and o

continuously, then we shall exclude topologically non-trivial congurations such as

semispin(32) bundles lacking vector structures. to see this, let p be a semispin(32)

bundle with a family of gauge connections, {t, t  [0, 1]}. suppose that, for each t,

the holonomy group of t is a cyclic group (typically of innite order) generated by an

element w 

t  semispin(32), such that

w 

0 = 1,

w 

1 = k16



1.

then, since (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 is the centraliser of k16



1, we have here an ex-

plicit realisation of turning the wilson line on continuously. but the reduction

theorem [1] states that p is reducible to a holonomy bundle of any connection on p .

for 0, such a holonomy bundle is a cross-section, and so p is trivial. as a trivial

semispin(32) bundle always has vector and exceptional structures, and as the dmw

vacua are undoubtedly dual to semispin(32) congurations without vector structures,

we are forced to abandon the notion that duality necessarily involves continuous turn-

ing on of wilson lines. this is a natural consequence of permitting compactications

more complicated than s1  r9.

in fact, a more physical argument to this eect is advanced in ref.[6]. henceforth,

therefore, we shall not require semispin(32) to be broken to (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2

by a wilson line that can be continuously turned on; in fact, we should allow any

semispin(32) bundle admitting a (spin(16)

spin(16))  z2 subbundle. this allows us

to accept vacua without vector structures, but, at the same time, it forces us to deal

with vacua lacking exceptional structures. in the orbifold context, these arise, in a very

remarkable way, from the detailed structure of the twisting matrix.

if a given semispin(32) conguration does have a vector structure, then we can

31

use the 32 representation of so(32), and the theory may be constructed using 32 left-

moving fermions in such a multiplet.

if we wish to study t-duality on the orbifold

t 4/z2, then, in projecting from t 4, we must eect a twist in the gauge group in

order to preserve level matching [30]. the twist acts on 32 by the so(32) matrix

x(m, n), a diagonal matrix with non-zero entries equal to 1, with m negative entries

in the rst 16 places and n negative entries in the last 16 places, m + n being even.

level matching requires m + n to be 4 modulo 8. we shall consider the case m + n = 12.

here semispin(32) is broken to spin(20)

spin(12), the double dot meaning as usual

that the centres (both isomorphic to z2  z2) are completely identied.

let us consider rst the simplest case, the case in which the wilson line can be

 turned on continuously. such a conguration is topologically trivial, and should have

both vector and exceptional structures : let us conrm this. let w 

t be the holonomy

element dened earlier, and let wt be the corresponding so(32) matrix. now z2 acts

on t 4 by reversing the signs of all four cartesian coordinates. it therefore reverses

the sense in which a non-contractible loop is traversed. if wt is to descend to t 4/z2,

therefore, we must have

x(m, n)wtx(m, n)1 = w 1

t

, for all t.

since w1 = diag(i16, i16), we can set wt = exp(tb), where, following ref.[6], we put

0 i8
0
i8

b =



 .

016

thus we need x(m, n)bx(m, n)1 = b, and so in this case m = 8, and so n = 4. thus

x(8, 4) is the twisting matrix when the wilson line is continuously turned on.

now the elements of spin(32) and semispin(32) corresponding to x(8, 4) are,

respectively, k8  k4 and k8

k4, and the relevant element of spin(16)  spin(16) is





k8  k4. as ( k8)2 = ( k4)2 = 1, we see that k8  k4, k8  k4, and k8





k4 are all of

order two. any u (1) subgroup of spin(16)

spin(16) which contains k8

k4 is therefore





covered in spin(16)  spin(16) and spin(16)  spin(16) by groups isomorphic to z2 

32

u (1). it follows that if such a u (1) is the structural group of a u (1) bundle which extends

to an spin(16)

spin(16) bundle, then the latter has non-trivial spin(16)spin(16) and

spin(16)  spin(16) double covers. as expected, this semispin(32) conguration has

both vector and exceptional structures, and t-duality can be implemented in this case.

if, however, we drop the requirement that wilson lines be continuously turned

on, then we can allow other twisting matrices x(m, n), with m + n = 12. for example,

we might take x(10, 2). now ( k10)2 = ( k2)2 = 1, but this is not a problem in

semispin(32), since we have

(( k10)

( k2))2 = (1)

(1) = 1,

so the twisting element is still of order two, as it must be for a z2 orbifold. similarly,

(1)  (1) = 1 in spin(16)  spin(16)  that is, in spin(32)  so ( k10)  ( k2) is

likewise of order two. from our earlier discussions, we conclude that the model with

the x(10, 2) twisting matrix still has a vector structure. but we have

(( k10)  ( k2))2 = (1)  (1) 6= 1

in spin(16)  spin(16). if we try to lift to spin(16)  spin(16), we will have a twisting

element of order four, which does not make sense on a z2 orbifold. this is a signal that

there is no exceptional structure in this case. similarly, the matrix x(6, 6) corresponds

to a model with a vector structure but without an exceptional structure.

it may perhaps seem odd that x(8, 4) and x(10, 2) can lead to distinct models,

since they appear to represent dierent ways of distributing 12 minus signs in a diagonal

so(32) matrix. however, k8 k4 and k10 k2 are certainly very dierent : they are not

mutually conjugate, for example. the point to bear in mind is that, unlike spin(16) 

spin(16), spin(16)

spin(16), and so(16)  so(16), the group spin(16)  spin(16) is

not contained in any group locally isomorphic to so(32). consequently, two apparently

very similar so(32) or semispin(32) congurations can behave very dierently with

respect to t-duality. in this instance, the precise form of the twisting matrix determines

whether a global t-dual partner exists at all.

33

7. conclusion

the principal ndings of this work can be stated very simply. on r9  s1, the two

heterotic string theories are related by t-duality : one theory compactied on a circle

of radius r is equivalent to the other compactied on a circle of radius proportional to

1/r. as soon, however, as one goes to manifolds of greater complexity, the analogous

statement is questionable : t-duality can be obstructed topologically. this is true even

on so simple a manifold as t 2r8, even though one may wish to invert the radius of only

one circle. that is, whether t-duality works for a given circle depends on the context

of that circle. (see ref. [16] for a much more subtle instance of this.) more mundanely,

the essential point here is that the two gauge groups, e8  e8 and semispin(32), are

not quite as similar as their lie algebras might lead one to expect.

from a practical point of view, our results mean that any discussion of the relation-

ship between the two heterotic theories must involve a computation of the exceptional

stiefel-whitney class x2 (or of y2 if one begins on the e8  e8 side). if x2 fails to

vanish, then a comparison is not meaningful, whatever the local situation may suggest.
