abstract

we consider the 

4!(4

1 + 4

2) model on a d-dimensional euclidean space, where all but one of

the coordinates are unbounded. translation invariance along the bounded coordinate, z, which

lies in the interval [0, l], is broken because of the boundary conditions (bcs) chosen for the

hyperplanes z = 0 and z = l. two dierent possibilities for these bcs boundary conditions

are considered: dd and nn, where d denotes dirichlet and n newmann, respectively. the

renormalization procedure up to one-loop order is applied, obtaining two main results. the rst

is the fact that the renormalization program requires the introduction of counterterms which are

surface interactions. the second one is that the tadpole graphs for dd and nn have the same z

dependent part in modulus but with opposite signs. we investigate the relevance of this fact to

the elimination of surface divergences.

1 introduction

in this paper we consider an interacting quantum eld theory model in the presence of boundaries.

we shall assume that the system is nite along one dimension z  [0, l], and innitely extended
along the remaining (d  1) directions.

the presence of geometric restrictions on the domain of one of the coordinates of the system,

demands the introduction of classical boundary conditions, to be satised by the elds on the

two hypersurfaces at z = 0 and z = l. if we restrict ourselves to a real scalar eld, hermiticity

of the hamiltonian leads us to ve dierent (inequivalent) choices for the bcs, namely: dd,

nn, dn, periodic and anti-periodic. the last two choices are usual in the nite-temperature

literature, and shall not be dealt with here, since they dont break translation invariance, which

is the phenomenon we are concerned with.

physical systems will be, in general, nite along several directions. for the sake of simplicity

we will consider a d-dimensional layered geometry. although the highly idealized case of planar

boundaries misses a whole series of features that are present in the general, curved boundary

case, for more general shapes the multiple reection method can be used to nd the correlation

functions of the model [1].

most of the papers in the literature deal with periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions,

where translation symmetry is maintained, and surface eects avoided. moreover, in quantum

systems where translation symmetry is broken, the renormalization procedure is more involved

than for translation invariant systems, either bounded or unbounded.

1

the diagrammatic expansion and the renormalization program for an unbounded system is

conveniently performed in momentum space. on the other hand, when dd or nn bcs are

implemented, one may still work with greens functions at xed (d1) dimensional momenta, since
there is translation symmetry along those dimensions. as discussed by many authors, associated

with the breaking of translational invariance, a new feature emerges: the existence of one particle

reducible primitively divergent diagrams. for example, the bare two-point function g0(x, x) of the

scalar model with zero, one or two points on the surfaces have dierent renormalization constants,

respectively.

in this paper we will consider a scalar theory subject to two dierent classical bcs: dd and

nn. besides the lack of translational invariance, we shall face the problem of surface divergences.

one way to avoid them is to smooth out the plates surface. but in this case an ambiguity appears,

since loop-graphs will depend on an ad-hoc model assumption, namely, the particular features of

the smooth walls. consequently, we prefer to maintain the hard walls assumption. in the context

of the casimir energy of minimally coupled scalar elds, many authors used soft, hard and semi-

hard bcs [2]. dierent questions sometimes require more complicated bcs, like the quantum

mechanical treatment of the boundary conditions presented by ford and svaiter [3], a device

implemented to solve a long standing paradox concerning the renormalized energy of minimally

and conformally coupled scalar elds.

besides the above mentioned eects due to the existence of surfaces and the breaking of trans-

lation symmetry, we do also have, of course, nite size eects, which are of a dierent nature.

2

various investigations have been made on this subject, mostly from the quantum statistical me-

chanics point of view, and we present a short review here. pathria and co-workers studied the

bose-einstein condensation of an ideal relativistic bose-gas conned to a rectangular box of sizes

l1, l2 and l3 with periodic boundary conditions on all the walls [4]. a systematic study of nite

size systems and phase transitions was developed by brezin and zinn-justin [5]. these authors

studied the o(n) model in two dierent geometries: the periodic cube and the cylinder along one

dimension (the time) and nite and periodic in the (d  1) remaining dimensions. nemirovsky
and freed considered the same model but in a complementary situation regarding the boundary

conditions, namely, (d  1) dimensions are unbounded, and periodicity along the only nite di-
mension, and [6]. afterwards, singh and pathria studied the o(n)d model conned to geometries

with periodic boundary conditions in all directions [7]. the same model in the presence of one

mirror localized at z = 0 was also studied by many authors [8].

another ingredient, important in nite size systems at criticality, is the concept of nite size

scaling. let us consider a nite system of linear size l and suppose a thermodynamic quantity

pl(t) (where t is the reduced temperature) becomes singular as t  0. dening pl(t)
where p (t) is the bulk value of pl(t), the statement of nite size scaling is that g(l, t) = f (l/(t)),

p (t) = g(l, t),

where (t) is the correlation length. in other words, nite size scaling predicts that, for large l,

the dependence on l of the singular contributions to thermodynamics functions scales with the

correlation length, and is described by universal scaling functions. it may be pointed out that

nite size systems must be classied in two distinct groups with respect to nite size scaling,

3

depending on whether the b.c.s break translation invariance or not. for nite size systems where

translation invariance is maintained (for example, a periodic cube, or a cylinder innite along one

dimension, and nite and periodic in the (d  1) other dimensions), nite size scaling is easily
understood.

the renormalization group equations are insensitive to nite size eects (since the renormaliza-

tion is related to short distance singularities) and must, accordingly, be maintained in such nite

size geometries. however, the solutions to those equations must be dierent from those for the

unconstrained systems, because correlation functions can depend on the additional dimensional

quantities (the lengths of the compactied dimensions) and nite size scaling is present.

for the cases of dd, nn or dn b.c.s, the situation is quite dierent, since it is much more

dicult to decide if a given interaction is relevant, irrelevant or marginal, the reason being that

the propagator of the critical theory satises b.c.s which can interfere with the power counting.

finite size eects have also been extensively studied in the quantum eld theory context

during the last twenty years. in at spacetime with one compactied dimension, the mass can

depend upon the periodicity length [9]. this phenomenon is of particular interest in theories with

broken symmetry, as it allows topological eects to play a role in the restoration of symmetry.

an equivalent mechanism is at work when we assume that the elds are in thermal equilibrium

with a reservoir at temperature 1 [10]. finite size eects in quantum eld theory with periodic

boundary conditions in the spatial section at nite temperature was analyzed by many authors.

see, for example, [11], and references therein.

4

in the context of non-abelian gauge eld theories at zero temperature, cavity qcd was studied

by many authors [12]. hanson and jae and also hanson, jonhson and peterson dealt with

quantum elds in bounded domains with broken translation invariance. regarding abelian gauge

theories, quantum electrodynamics in the presence of conducting plates has also been the focus

of research [13]. based on the fact that the b.c.s for the electron eld could lead to additional

contributions to the casimir force, bordag et al. and also robaschik et al. adopted the following

model. a photon eld obeys classical b.c.s on perfectly conducting plates, while the b.cs for

the fermion eld are free. these authors assumed that the electromagnetic eld also exists in the

region outside the plates (two simple connected domains). chodos and thorn investigated the

self-energy of fermions used dierent b.cs (the slab-bag), where the fermionic eld is conned

between two parallel plates and the photon eld is unconned. in at spacetime, for systems where

some dimensions are compactied but translational invariance is maintained, toms [14] and also

birrel and ford [15] have shown that all the counterterms are independent on the compactied

spatial size. a more general discussion has been given by banach [16]. this author proved that a

topological identication (periodic or anti-periodic b.c.s) does not introduce new counterterms

into the theory. as stressed by many authors, were this not the case there would be a catastrophe

in the renormalizability of the model.

for translation invariant systems, because of poincare invariance, one should expect that over-

lapping divergences will not obstruct the implementation of the renormalization program [17]. in

systems where poincare invariance does not hold, these proofs do not apply, and one must show

5

that it is still possible to implement such program. a technical diculty is also met here, since the

presence of geometric restrictions makes feynman diagrams harder to compute than is ordinary

quantum eld theory in unbounded systems. an crucial work on this subject has been presented

by symanzik [18]. of particular importance are also the papers by nemirovsky and freed, and

krech and dietrich [19].

in this work we shall consider an anisotropic scalar model, in a d-dimensional euclidean space,

where the rst (d  1) coordinates are unbounded and the last one lies in the interval [0, l]. we
analyze two dierent translation symmetry breaking b.c.s: dd and nn on the plates. we rst

present a rederivation of the fact that to renormalize the theory one has to introduce counterterms

as surface interactions. we also show that the tadpole graphs for dd and for nn b.c.s have

the same modulus for their z-dependent parts, but their signs are opposite. we study the possible

use of this property to get rid of the surface divergences.

the organization of the paper is as follows: in section ii we present the general formalism. in

section iii we discuss the slab congurations, dealing with the two-point and four-point functions,

both for dd and nn b.c. in section iv we analyze the divergences of the translational invariant

part of the tadpoles. section v deals with the analysis of the ultraviolet and infrared divergences

of the z-dependent part of the tadpoles. finally, section vi contains our conclusions. throughout

this paper we use h = c = 1.

6

2 general formalism and the scalar anisotropic model

let us consider z[j], the generating functional of complete greens functions for a scalar eld

in a d-dimensional euclidean space

where

z[j] = z d es[]+r j(x)(x)

s[] = z ddx[l((x), (x))] ,

(1)

(2)

d is the appropriate measure, and s[] is the classical action associated with the scalar eld.
the quantity z[j] can be regarded as a functional integral representation for the imaginary time

evolution operator h2| u(t2, t1) |1i with the boundary conditions: (t1, x) = 1(~x) and (t2, x) =
2(~x). the quantity z[j] gives the transition amplitude from the initial state |1i to the nal state
|2i in the presence of some scalar source j(x), of compact support. regarding the lagrangian
density l, we shall assume it to be

l() =

the n-point correlation functions are given by the expectation value with respect to the weight

es() dened as

g(n)(x1, x2, .., xn) =< (x1)...(xn) > =

1

z(j)

nz(j)

j(x1)j(x2)..j(xn)|j=0

7

= z d(x1)...(xn)es[] .

(4)

as usual, w (j), the generating functional for connected correlation functions of the elementary

elds shall be given by w (j) = lnz(j). thus

g(n)

c (x1, x2, .., xn) =

nw (j)

j(x1)j(x2)..j(xn)|j=0 =< (x1)...(xn) >c .

(5)

finally, (0), the generating functional of connected one-particle irreducible correlation functions

is introduced by performing a legendre transformation on w [j],

and

where

(0) = w (j) +z ddx (x)j(x)

(n)(x1, x2, .., xn) =

n(0)

0(x1)0(x2)..0(xn)|0=0

0(x) =

w
j(x)

.

if  = 0 the partition function z(j) can be calculated exactly i.e.

z0(j) = exp(cid:18)1

2 z ddxddy j(x)d(x  y, m2)j(y)(cid:19) ,

where

(x + m2)d(x  y, m2) = d(x  y).

for  6= 0 it is not possible to nd exactly z(j) and perturbation theory is mandatory. this
expansion stems from the formal identity:

z(j) = exp




4! z ddx  

j(x)!4

 z0(j).

(11)

from now on, we shall consider a generalization of the previous case, namely, the anisotropic

landau-ginzburg model for a n = 2 component order parameter with a lagrange density l =
l0 + lint, where

l0(1, 2) =

(13)

to generate the n-point functions we have to introduce two scalar sources j1(x) and j2(x) coupled

linearly with the elds 1(x) and 2(x) respectively. integrating out the elds, we obtain z(j1)

and z(j2) and the total partition function of the model factorizes: z(j1, j2) = z(j1)z(j2), where

z(j1,2) =

in the above equation, g(2)

2 (x  y, m2) are the free propagators, solutions of

the inhomogeneous equations (i = 1, 2).

(x + m2)g(2)

i (x  y, m2) = d(x  y).

(16)

the partition function applies to arbitrary geometries, and classical b.c.s must be implemented

on the greens functions. as discussed before, we will assume that the system is conned between

two parallel plates localized at z = 0 and z = l, and use the cartesian coordinates x = (~r, z)

where ~r is a (d  1) dimensional vector perpendicular to the z direction. a question that arises
in such a model is related to the renormalization conditions. it is well known that for elds inter-

acting with a thermal bath dened in manifolds where the spacelike sections are non-compact the

mass and coupling constant counterterms are temperature independent. using dimensional regu-

larization [20] it was proved that for elds dened on manifolds where the spacelike sections are

non-compact, or compact in at least one dimension, but with the other dimensions noncompact-

ied, the mass and coupling constant counterterms are size and temperature independent at the

two-loop level. in a perturbative scheme, the renormalized theory is xed by the renormalization

conditions for the supercially divergent vertex functions (the one particle irreducible parts of the

connected greens functions). in other words, in the conventional renormalizable (translational

invariant) theory the ultraviolet divergences can be absorbed by counterterms related to the eld,

mass and coupling constant. a question of fundamental importance is how the renormalization

program can be implemented in systems where translational invariance is broken. the purpose of

the next section is to analyze this question for the case of the anisotropic model at the one-loop

approximation.

10

3 finite size eects and classical boundary conditions

for the cubic anisotropic model, we dene the boundary conditions over the plates for the

elds 1(x) and 2(x). for the 1(x) eld we assume dirichlet-dirichlet boundary conditions i.e:

1(~r, z)|z=0 = 1(~r, z)|z=l = 0,

and for the 2(x) we will assume newmann-newmann boundary conditions, i.e.:


z

2(~r, z)|z=0 =


z

2(~r, z)|z=l = 0.

(17)

(18)

it is well known that 4he lms close to the  transition satises dd b.c. another well known

example of such kind of boundary conditions is the electromagnetic eld.

it was shown that

for an electromagnetic eld conned in a perfectly conducting cavity, it is possible to treat the

electric and magnetic modes separately, where each one satises dirichlet and newmann b.c.s,

respectively [21]. going back to our discussion, since the translational invariance is not preserved,

let us use a fourier expansion of the elds in the following form:

(~r, z) =

1

(2)

d1

2 z dd1pxn

n(~p)ei~p.~run(z).

(19)

where the un(z) are the normalized eigenfunctions of the operator  d2
and orthonormality relations, i.e.,

dz2 satisfying the completeness

un(z)un(z) = (z  z),

xn

11

(20)

and nally

z l

0

dz un(z)un(z) = n,n,

d
dz2 un(z) = k2

nun(z),



(21)

(22)

where kn = n

l , n = 1, 2.. for dd b.c and n = 0, 1, 2.. for nn b.c.

it should be noted that this kind of expansion in an orthonormal set corresponding to the

eigenfunctions of the hermitian operator  d2
forwardly generalized to dierent anisotropic models. for example, we might consider a scalar

dz2 dened on a nite interval could be quite straight-

eld dened on euclidean space with all the coordinates unbounded, but with a mass having an

anisotropy along the z coordinate. namely, the lagrangian density could be

l =

1
2

()2 +

1
2

(m2 + 2(z))2 +


4!

4 ,

(23)

which is, of course, non invariant under translations in z, except for the trivial case of a constant

(z).

if now we assume the un(z)s to denote the normalized eigenfunctions of the hermitian

operator

with

h = 

d2
dz2 + (z) ,

h un(z) = 2

nun(z) ,

(24)

(25)

the expansion (19) still holds. we assume  to be a non negative function, so that h is denite

positive.

12

we see that the case of dirichlet b.c.s could be obtained starting from an unbounded z

coordinate, and using the anisotropic mass (z) = ( z

l)n, with n  , and  a (positive)

constant. for a study of dirac fermions with a space dependent mass see for example ref. [22].

coming back to the case of dd and nn boundary conditions, the eigenfunctions are, respec-

tively,

and

un(z) = s 2

(26)

(27)

for nn b.c.s, we also have the zero mode u0(z) = 1
l

. the free propagator can be expressed in

the following form:

g(2)

0 (~r, z, z) =

1

(2)d1 z dd1pxn

ei~p.~run(z)un(z) g0,n(~p),

(28)

where is not dicult to show that g0,n(~p) is given by

g0,n(~p) = (~p 2 + k2

n + m2)1.

for the anisotropic mass case, we would have instead:

g0,n(~p) = (~p 2 + 2

n + m2)1.

(29)

(30)

as we discussed before, for translational invariant systems we have g(2)

0 (x  x)
and from coordinate space feynman rules we can go to momentum space representation, which is

0 (x, x) = g(2)

13

the more convenient framework to analyze the divergences of the theory. translation invariance is

reected in momentum conservation conditions. since our system possesses translation invariance

along the direction parallel to the plates, the parallel momentum, ~p, is conserved. in this case

a convenient representation is a mixed (~p, z) space. the feynman rules for dierent boundary

conditions was derived in many references and we will not repeat the rules here. for a careful

study of feynman rules in such systems see for example ref.

[23]. let us study the one-loop

correction to the bare two-point function g(2)

0 (x, x), both for the dd and nn cases. using the

feynman rules (see g.(1)) we have:

g(2)

note that both tdd(l, m, d, z) and tn n (l, m, d, z) diverge in their continuum momenta integrals

and also in the n summation.

in the next section we will analyze the ultraviolet behaviour of

the bare two-point functions i.e tdd(l, m, d, z) and tn n (l, m, d, z) . before dealing with the

renormalization of the one-loop two point function, let us, by the sake of completeness, discuss

the bare four-point function. the expression for the bare four-point function is given below,

and the same analysis of the divergences can be done. in this paper we will not implement the

renormalization program of the four point-function (which follows using the same procedure used in

the two-point function). our object of interest is the two-point function, since it is the fundamental

quantity that measures the vacuum activity. using the feynman rules, g(4)

order 2 correction to the bare four-point function, is given by

it is worth mentioning that the structure of the divergences of eqs.(45-48) are the same as for the

tadpoles, as we will see. in the next section we will analyze the renormalization program for the

two-point functions in both cases of dd and nn boundary conditions.

4 analysis of the ultraviolet divergences of tdd(l, m, d, z)

and tnn (l, m, d, z)

the aim of this section is to analyze the structure of the divergences of the bare two-point functions

for both cases dd and nn boundary conditions. let us start from the expression of the vacuum

activity for the case of dd boundary conditions, i.e.,

tdd(l, m, d, z) =

.

(51)

(52)

in an analogous way, it is also possible to calculate the vacuum activity for the nn b.c.

i.e.

tn n (l, m, d, z) and we obtain

tn n (l, m, d, z) =

+ gf2(l, m, d, z).

(53)

since tdd(l, m, d, z) and tn n (l, m, d, z) have the same functional form, both have the same kind

of ultraviolet divergences. let us dene f1(l, m, d) by:

f1(l, m, d) =

the equation above has ultraviolet divergences, but it is (formally) proportional to the tadpole

in nite temperature eld theory, after the identication:   2l. to deal with the divergences
of the one-loop two-point function at nite temperature we have to do frequency sums and (d 
1) dimensional integrals for the continuum momenta. the most popular method to deal with

matsubara sums is to analytic extension away from the discrete complex energies down to real axis

with the replacement of the energy sums by contour integrals [25]. we prefer to use dimensional

regularization in the continuum [20], and afterwards to analytically extend the modied epstein

19

zeta function which appear after the dimensional regularization [26]. since the formalism has

already been developed by malbouisson and svaiter in [27], we will only sketch the procedure

here. first we have to use a well known result of dimensional regularization, i.e.

ddk

(k2 + a2)s =

and let us dene the modied epstein zeta function (z, a) by:

(z, a) =



xn=

(n2 + a2)z a2 > 0,

(55)

(56)

which is analytic for re(z) > 1

2. it is possible to analytic extend the modied epstein zeta function

where the integral representation is valid for re(z) < 1, [28]:

(57)

using eqs.(55) and (57) in eq.(54), we get a polar part (size independent) plus a size dependent

analytic correction. it is clear that the mass counterterm generated by f1(l, m, d) is size indepen-

dent, as the nite temperature eld theory has no temperature dependent counterterm. the rst

interesting result of the paper is given by eqs.(51) and and (53). the tadpole graphs expressed by

tdd(l, m, d, z) and tn n (l, m, d, z) have the same z dependent part in modulus but with opposite

signs. from the above discussion it is possible to understand the niteness of the renormalized

stress-tensor of an electromagnetic eld near a at prefectly conducting plate. although the ex-

pectation value of the squared electric and magnetic eld are divergent, a delicate cancellation

makes the renormalized stress-tensor nite. as the size-dependent parts of tdd(l, m, d, z) and

20

tn n (l, m, d, z) have the same functional form and opposite signs, and recalling that it is possible

to treat the electric and magnetic modes separately (where one obeys dd and the other nn b.c.,

we automatically obtain a nite result for the vacuum expectation value of the stress-tensor of the

electromagnetic eld. it is important to stress that when the conducting boundary is curved, the

energy density diverges on the boundary [29].

to shall deal with the renormalization program in the one-loop approximation in the next

section, also discussing, for the sake of completeness, the issue of ir divergencies in dierent

numbers of dimensions.

5 analysis of the ultraviolet and infrared divergences of

the z-dependent part of the tadpoles

we will again use the fact that dd1p = pd2dp dd1 and r dd1 = 2

that, had we chosen m2 = 0, the ultraviolet divergences would have kept the same polar structure.

. it should be noted

consequently, for simplicity let us choose again m = 0, and for reasons that will become evident

latter, we rst assume d > 3. the special case d = 3 is discussed at the end of this section.

in a general way, the regularization process is achieved introducing exponential cut-o regulators

and after this the identication of the poles of the regularized quantity by means of the laurent

series expansion around some point i.e.

the negative power portion of such series. note that

instead of imposing renormalization conditions over the 1pi correlation functions we can simply

subtract the singular part of the laurent series around some point, by the introduction of the

counterterms. let us assume z 6= 0 and z 6= l. a straightforward calculation gives

f2(l, m, d, z)|m=0 =

(60)

in the rst integral for large z, (coth kl  1) has the behavior: (coth kl  1)  e2kl. moreover,
the second integral in the above equation is ultraviolet nite for z 6= 0. let us dene x = kl and
q = kz in the rst and second integrals above respectively. then eq.(60) becomes:

(61)

the second term in the above equation gives us the well known result that for a massless minimal

coupled scalar eld < 2(x) > diverges as 1

z2 if we approach the plate [30]. in order to analyze

the polar part of f2(l, 0, d, z), we use the denition of the gamma function. let us dene i1(, )

22

and i2(, ) by

and

i1(, ) = z

(63)

(z, a) =

(n + a)z , re(z) > 1, a 6= 0,1,2...

then, using eqs. (62), (63) and (64) in eq. (61) we have that:

f2(l, m, d, z)|m=0 =
+

we see that the regularized f2(l, 0, d, z) has two poles of order (d  2) in z = 0 and in z = l.
note that the residues of the poles in z = 0 and in z = l are l-independent. since the domain

of analyticity of the zeta function is d > 3, the case d = 3 must be studied separately. dierent

treatments for d = 3 and d = 4 simply express the fact that infrared divergences are more severe

in lower dimensions.

23

we will go back to eq.(52), studying the case m2 6= 0, to see how the ir divergences pop
up in the m2  0 limit. it is important to stress that, only in the n-n b.c.s case we have ir
divergences for massless elds, coming from the term n = 0, i.e., equations (51) and (52) are ir

nite for m = 0. a straightforward calculation yields

f2(l, m, d, z) =

the second integral in the above expression is convergent for z 6= 0, and dening v = 2z, it
becomes:

2mz

dv ev =

1
4z

h2(3)(1, 2mz),

(69)

where (a, x) is the incomplete gamma function. consequently, we have a simple pole for z = 0.

again, the residue of this pole is l-independent. to complete the regularization procedure we

have now to analyze the rst integral of eq.(68):

.

(70)

the second integral in the right side of eq.(70) is convergent and the rst one has a simple pole

at z = l, again with an l-independent residue.

24

from the discussion above, we can conclude that, in order to eliminate the ultraviolet diver-

gences of the theory we have to introduce counterterms as surface interactions, and consequently

the full action will have the following form for both elds 1 and 2:

s() = z l

4) +z dd1r(c12(~r, 0) + c22(~r, l)).

(71)

as we have already taken care of the ultraviolet divergences, let us study the infrared divergent

piece (for m = 0) of f2(l, m, d, z)|d=3. let us call this piece f 2 (l, m, d, z)|d=3. note that we
introduce an ultraviolet cut-o in order to use the bernoulli representation of the integrand.

f 2 (l, m, d, z)|d=3 =

(72)

writing the integrand using the bernoulli polynomials it is not dicult to show that

1
2l

h2(3)b0(

z

)ln(

) + regular part (f 2 (l, m, z)).

(73)

when m  0 we have a logarithmic divergence which is z dependent.

going back to the case of the ultraviolet divergence, some authors claimed that the introduction

of surface counterterms is against the spirit of the renormalization program. in our case, however,

it is possible to change the model, by adding a new interaction term, in such a way that the

ultraviolet divergences coming from the f2(l, m, d, z) contributions corresponding to each eld are

compensated. one possibility is to consider the o(2) symmetric model with a 2

12

2 interaction

term. then the z-dependent part of each tadpole cancel each other out. the situation is similar to

the case of supersymmetric theories, where the niteness of some correlation functions is achieved

25

by a balance between bosonic and fermionic loops. the o(2) symmetric model with an interaction

term 2

12

2 (dd and nn b.c.s) developes a size dependent mass m2 proportional to gl2, as

the 4 model at nite temperature. in the same way as temperature can solve the ir problem in

some qft models, nite size eects can also cure these divergences, when a resummation can be

implemented.

as stressed by many authors, in the electromagnetic case, the origin of the unboundedness

renormalized stress-tensor near a curved surface has the origin in the unphysical nature of classical

perfect conductor boundary condition. let us suppose the following physical situation. for the

low energy modes the manifold is [0, l]  d1 and for the high energy modes we have s1  d1,
let us assume a sharp cut-o and for kn <  we have dd boundary conditions and for
i.e.

kn   we have periodic b.c.s. the high frequencies do not see the mirror at z = 0, and
translational invariance is maintained only for these modes. if the collapse of the renormalization

program (removing innities from perturbative calculations using only bulk counterterms) is

related with the break of translational invariance, our improved model must be renormalizable. a

further study of this model may be of interest. a dierent possibility is to construct an eective

action for the slow-modes and after this imposing the dd or nn b.c. [31][32].

6 conclusions

in this paper we studied nite size eects in an interacting eld theory, with broken translation

invariance. we calculated the vacuum activity for an anisotropic model, between two parallel plates

26

in a d dimensional euclidean space. it has been possible to obtain closed expressions for < 2

1(x) >

and < 2

2(x) >, for elds satisfying dd and nn b.c.s, respectively. for dierent shapes,

the complexity and the number of technical diculties increase enormously, but the multiple

scattering method can be used in these cases [1], at least for small curvatures of the boundaries.

we presented a model having the interesting property that the z-dependent part of the tadpole

graphs for dd and nn b.c.s have the same modulus and opposite signs. this fact could explain

the boundedness of the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the energy-stress tensor of the

electromagnetic eld in the casimir-like conguration.

we have also seen that, to renormalize the theory, counterterms corresponding to surface

interactions are required. one can, however, avoid this diculty by equipping the model with a

2

12

2 interaction. then, the z dependent pieces of each tadpole cancel each other out, and the

two elds develop a size dependent mass m2 proportional to gl2, as for the single 4 model at

nite temperature.

there are several directions in which the nite size eects for systems with breaking of trans-

lational invariance which may deserve further research. to mention a few of them: the study

of interacting fermions, the non-linear  model in domains with one nite direction and (d  1)
innite directions [33], and nally as a straightforward extension of this work, the study of the

o(2) symmetric model at the two-loop approximation.

as discussed in the introduction, one should prove that the the renormalization program can

be implemented beyond the one-loop approximation, where overlapping divergences emerge.
