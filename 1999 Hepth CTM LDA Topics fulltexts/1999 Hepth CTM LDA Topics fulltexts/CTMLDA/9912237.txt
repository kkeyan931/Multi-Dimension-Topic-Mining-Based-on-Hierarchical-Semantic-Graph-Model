(3.6) = i1 . important point is, axial currents j5 = 5ei5 = i+1 coincide sign-symmetric states j5 = i+1 = +1 = j5 . (3.7) (3.8) (3.9) general, however, one cannot derive sign symmetry fermion spectrum case sign symmetry eq. (3.5), latter true region ii, spectrum determined dirac equation unication regions + ii. straightforward solution equations (2.8-9) account boundary conditions (2.7) constraint (2.10) gives following equation spectrum: exp(4ix1 2i1) = 1 e2ikd i(+k) 1 e2ikd +i(k) i(k) +i(+k) i(+k) 1 e2ikd i(k) 1 e2ikd +i(+k) +i(k) , (3.10) 2 = k2 + 2 1 = (x1). analysing equation (3.10) one easily nds fermionic spectrum reveals symmetry , 4x1 21 = , (3.11) integer, since values derivative eld (x) l. h. s. equation (3.10) reduces (1)s exp(4ix1). however, case 1 = 2x1, hence equation (3.11) leads single possibility = 0, parameter remains arbitrary. result diers crucially case considered , 1 = 0 virtue vanishing boson condensate region i, set solutions dierent 6= 0 emerges. latter case, however, equation (3.11) produces non-trivial relation x1. 6 according eq.

(3.14) average given bags state includes, denition, average lled sea negative energy states n < 0 + possible lled valence fermion states n > 0 , dropped moment status discussed specially below. finally, (3.12) (3.13) (3.15) hj5i = hj5isea = 1 2 xn<0 1 + 2 xn>0 n i1n . let us emphasize, (3.15) division fermions sea valence ones made correspondence sign eigen-frequencies n, dier sign-symmetric n shift (3.16) possess symmetry . however, suppose additionally n n signs n n coincide, i. e. shifting none ns changes sign, condition n < 0 eq. (3.15) equivalent condition n n = n + , > > < 0 . hence hj5isea = 1 2 xn<0 1 + 2 xn>0 n i1n = 0 (3.17) virtue relation (3.9). turn, means eq. (2.4b) region ii reduces = 0, excellent agreement assumption (x) = const region ii. words, obtain solution coupled equations (2.4) region ii form linear function (3.6) scalar eld, equation (3.16) fermion energy spectrum, n dened eq. (3.10) replacing l. h. s. exp(4ix1). following keypoints, make solution meaningful. rst niteness intermediate region size d, innite region ii solution (3.6) obviously unacceptable. case, however, size intermediate region always nite construction, boson eld (x) acquires solitonic behavior region iii due self-interaction v (). following circumstance manifests again: (1+1)d chiral coupling ei5 cannot cause solitonic behavior scalar eld virtue eects fermion-vacuum polarization only, i.e. without additional self-interaction bosons . another important circumstance calculation dirac sea average axial current j5 means symmetry . point kind averages 7 another consistent denition possible, namely, via called -invariant, often used study fermion vacuum polarization eects : 0 hj5isea = lim 1 2 xn<0 e|n|+ n i1n 1 2 xn>0 en+ n i1n . (3.18) since spectrum n symmetric, expression (3.18) doesnt vanish, contrast average (3.17). expression (3.18) connection n n taken account, transforms lim sinh 0 xn>0 en+ n i1n , (3.19) 0 sum (3.19) diverges 1/, hj5i appears proportional doesnt vanish unless 6= 0. makes r.h.s.of eq. (2.4b), linear functions solution equation region ii. moreover, true fermionic averages too, particular v. e. v. fermion charge. approach, virtue discreteness fermionic spectrum, vacuum value charge zero, analogy case axial current. namely, c-odd expression charge q = 1 2 z dx  , (3.20) used, conditions sign-correspondence n n n, one obtains average q following hqi = hqisea = 1 2 xn<0 1 however, hqisea dened via -invariant, one obtains = 1 2 xn<0 1 2 xn>0 2 xn>0 = 0. (3.21) 0 hqisea = lim 1 2 xn<0 e|n| 1 2 xn>0 en 6= 0 (3.22) 6= 0 virtue absence symmetry . nethertheless, serious reasons consider relations (3.17) (3.21) adequate way calculation sea average problem. first, -invariant actually measure hamil- tonian asymmetry, rather fermion charge ground state. second, regularization schemes besides thermal regularization possible divergent sums hj5i hqi. also, warranty regularized expressions (3.18) (3.22) would produce correct results 0. easy give example, dependence parameter sum integral continuous, particular, f (k) = r 0 dx sin kx/x = /2 k > 0, f (0) = 0, i.e. case limit integral k 0 exact value k = 0 dierent. let us consider adiabatic process changing gradient boson eld region ii, starting = 0. initial moment n = n, c-odd fermionic sea average obviously disappears: h. . . isea 0 reasonable regularization scheme. let us take account case fermionic spectrum discrete depends 8 continuously, small enough ns keep signs. general grounds h. . . isea vanish still, although spectrum n already non-symmetric -invariant nonzero. therefore reasonable assume case thermal regularization yield physically inconsistent results c-odd quantities axial current fermion charge vacuum. worth-while note essential dierence situation case innite space, spectrum continuous. latter case, density states changes small change , averages change too, gives rise eect induced fermion numbers . finally, possible check self-consistency solution (3.6) numerically. case problem solved lattice, number degrees freedom, well number fermion levels, nite, one doesnt need regularization all. results calculations show linear function (3.6) vanishing averages self-consistent solution problem. interpretation result following. case boson eld discontinuities (it doesnt vanish region i, too), topologically equivalent odd soliton would take place absence fermions due self-interaction v () only. therefore, topological number depend existence sizes spatial regions fermions (i ii). hand, baryon charge hybrid bag is, denition, sum topological charge boson soliton fermion charge bag interior. latter one zero case, hence baryon charge determined completely topological charge boson eld, depend sizes regions ii, correspondence general ideology hybrid models. therefore, approach hadron composite particle, consists boson soliton, fermion bag coupled interaction intermediate region ii. note also, although quantum numbers composite particle completely determined soliton, doesnt mean lled fermion levels positive energy exist all. could take place small enough values parameter only. increases, negative levels n = |n| + unavoidably move positive part spectrum. change sign level decrease hqisea one unit charge, emerging positive level valence fermion, sum qval + qsea remains unchanged. analogously, total axial current equal jval + jsea change too, ensures vanishing r.h.s.
