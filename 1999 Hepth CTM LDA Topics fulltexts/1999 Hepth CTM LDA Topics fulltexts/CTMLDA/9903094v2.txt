abstract

certain two and three point functions of gauge invariant primary operators of n =4
sym are computed in n =1 superspace keeping all the -components. this allows one
to read o many component descendent correlators. our results show the only possible
g2
y m corrections to the free eld correlators are contact terms. therefore they vanish
for operators at separate points, verifying the known non-renormalization theorems.
this also implies the results are consistent with n =4 supersymmetry even though the
lagrangian we use has only n =1 manifest supersymmetry. we repeat some of the
calculations using supersymmetric landau gauge and obtain, as expected, the same
results as those of supersymmetric feynman gauge.

1 introduction

perturbative string theories are described by two dimensional world sheet conformal eld
theories: string theory is holographic[1] at the perturbative level. maldacenas conjecture[2]
states that this is true even at the non-perturbative level. according to this conjecture, the
physics of string/m theory on various near horizon geometries is encoded in lower dimensional
conformal eld theories. one of the examples considered is d3 branes in type iib superstring
theory. by taking a limit where the eld theory on the brane decouples from the bulk, it was
argued that type iib string/supergravity on ads5 s5 is dual to d=4, n =4 super yang-
mills(sym4). therefore, if the conjecture is correct in its strongest form, i.e., for any nc
and g2
y m , it could provide non-perturbative understanding of type iib string theory through
its connection to sym4. this connection is made more precise in [3]. there it was proposed
that bulk congurations with some boundary conditions should be described by sym4 with
appropriate source terms couple to the bulk elds evaluated on the boundary. there has
been progress in understanding ads dynamics from sym4[5].

on the other hand, in a large nc with large xed  = g2

y m nc, supergravity can be
used to describe strongly coupled sym4. much evidence has been accumulated so far along
this line[4]. in [6], in particular, all three point functions of general gauge invariant chiral
primary operators (cpo) of n =4 sym were considered keeping only free eld contributions
and compared with the supergravity calculations. by the equality of those two results, the
authors were led to conjecture that the three point correlators of all cpos at large nc are
independent of . to the order of g2
y m , dhoker et al. [7] checked the conjecture (even at
nite nc) by exploiting the known non-renormalization theorems [10] for certain two and
three point functions.

in both directions of the studies of ads/cft correspondence mentioned above, it is
important to have an ecient tool to compute the sym correlators of sym4. in this letter,
we present a n =1 superspace computation of g2
y m corrections to certain two and three
point functions of gauge invariant operators(four point functions have been considered in
[8] keeping the lowest components and in [9] using n =2 harmonic superspace.). the full
n =1 computation does not require much additional work and provides more data, i.e.,
descendent operators, at one stroke. this work is a rst step toward the calculation of
more general correlators than the ones considered here and correlators at orders higher
than g2
y m . for the two and three point functions considered, we show the only possible
leading corrections are contact terms and therefore vanish for the operators at separate points
verifying the known non-renomalization theorems. this shows our results are consistent with
the n =4 supersymmetry [7] even though the calculation has been done in n =1 superspace.
a harmonic superspace discussion appears in [11].

in section 2, we compute at the order of g2

operators < o11o11 > d tr (11) tr( 1

y m the amplitudes of products of the traceless
2 >< tr(1ev 2)tr( 1ev 2) >,
and discuss r-symmetry invariance of the results. we also compute < o11o22o33 ><
tr (11) tr (22) tr (33) >. in section 3, we discuss the calculations in supersymmetric
landau gauge and check the gauge choice independence.
implications of our results are
discussed in the concluding section. throughout this article, we follow the conventions of
[13].

where  is an n = 1 chiral supereld containing (, , f ) and vector supereld v contains
(a , , d) in the wess-zumino gauge. whether  is a supereld or a component will be
obvious from the context. the superspace correlators can be obtained by rst computing
the eective action of js, sef f (j), and then taking the functional derivatives with respect
to js. one can also read o many component correlators from sef f (j) by taking functional
derivatives with respect to component sources which, in the chiral case, are dened by

j  j|

and similarly for complex conjugates. one can dene the components of a non-chiral source
too, but below we will consider only chiral cases to illustrate this point.

the easiest example to compute is < o11o11 >=< tr11 tr 1

in the feynman gauge the only contribution comes from the graph on fig. 1a. the self-
energy insertions, fig. 1b,d, cancel each other. the tadpole graph, fig. 1c , vanishes in
feynman gauge. writing down covariant derivatives explicitly on fig. 1a , and absorbing
d2, d2 to complete the superspace measures of the chiral vertices, we have

figure 2:

where the equality is obtained by partially integrating the d2, d2 in the bottom lines as
indicated by arrows. first consider d2. there are three terms, but the only contribution
comes from when d2 acts on j : the other two graphs vanish because of the grassman
-functions on k-line and q-line. a similar argument holds for d2 and the result is

where n = p/|p| and the propagators are euclidean ones. we omit the overal factor
g2
y m nc(n 2
c  1) because all corrections we compute have the same factor. from now on, we
will often drop sub- and/or super- indices on js too. since the sources j are anti-chiral, we
can replace d2 d2 by p2:

upon fourier transform, it becomes a local expression

ef f (j) = 2az d4pd4j(p, ) j(p, )
s(2)

taking functional derivatives with respect to j, j, we obtain

ef f (j) = 2az d4xd4j(x, ) j (x, )

< tr(cid:16)1(z1)1(z1)(cid:17) tr(cid:16) 1(z2) 1(z2)(cid:17) > = 2a z d8z8(z1  z) d2d28(z  z2)

(4)

(5)

where z = (, x). from (4) we can read o many component correlators. to do that, rst
consider the relevant source terms in components. in this case, the relevant source terms are
chiral ones and antichiral ones. in a schematic notation, we have

z 4xd2lj = z d4x [jf  + 2j + j(2f + )] + h.c.

(6)

therefore taking functional derivatives of path integrals with respect to two of the three
component sources gives a corresponding two point function. for example, we obtain, in a
schematic notation,

ef f  <    >  (x1  x2)

ef f  < (2f  + )(2 f  +  ) >  (x1  x2)

(7)

where  indicates that the equations are true up to unimportant numerical factors. the
contact terms are consistent with the conformal symmetry. all the other correlators are
zero. for example,


jf

 j

s(2)
ef f  <  (2 f  + ) > = 0

s(2)
ef f  <    > = 0

etc. the correlators in (7) also vanish for x1 6= x2, therefore consistent with the known non-
renormalization theorems. obviously this is true for all the other component correlators.

the next correlator, < o1

before, all self-energy graphs and tadpoles do not contribute. the graphs we need to consider

eq (10) shows that all the component correlators are sum of -functions and space-time
derivative acting on -functions, again consistent with the non-renormalization theorems.
for the component scalars, it is easy to check the consistency of eq (5) and eq (11) with the
su(4) r-symmetry. eq (5) and eq (11) give < tr11 tr 1 1 >= 2 < tr1 2 12 >= 2a.
now consider an innitesimal su(4) r-symmetry transformation of the component scalars
i and j.
in particular we consider a generator of su(4) which acts on s such that
1 =  2, 2 = 1, and 1 = 2. then su(4) r-symmetry implies

0 =  < tr1 2 tr 1

1 >

=  < tr 2 2 tr 1 1 > + < tr11 tr 1 1 > 2 < tr1 2 tr 12 >

(12)

the rst equality simply tells the vacum is r-symmetric. the rst term of the second
equality is zero giving the same relation as above.

so far, we have considered two simple correlators, < o11o11 > and < o1

and are given by fig. 3. the calculation will be almost identical giving the same result as

that there is an additional minus sign for fig. 5 of < (o1

the expansion. however the color factor of fig. 3b compensates for this minus sign.

(15)

the second term in f can be easily evaluated using method of [12] and it cancels the
rst term. therefore sef f =0. this shows at this order that all the component correlators
including < 11 (2f 22 + 22) (2f 33 + 33) > which was considered in [7] are zero
verifying non-renormalization of three point functions.

3 gauge choice independence

since the operators under consideration are gauge invariant, one expects the calculations
to be gauge choice independent and as we see below, our results conrm the expectation.
we consider landau gauge. in addition to the feynman gauge vector propagator, the n =1
gauge propagator has the following extra piece,

o  (1 + )

d2 d2 + d2d2

2

(16)

in landau gauge, all the graphs in fig. 1 need to be considered to compute < o11o11 >
because the self-energy graphs are not zero. since we have computed them in feynman
gauge,  = 1, what we must show is that all the extra contributions from eq(16) with  = 0
cancel each other. lets consider fig 1a,b and c one by one. (fig 1 d doesnt have a vector
propagator. therefore it need not be considered.) after rather straightforward d-algebra,
fig. 1a gives (from now on, a 1

2 acting on the vector lines is understood.)

now it is obvious that the sum of the results in fig. 8, fig. 9, and fig. 10 adds up to zero

its more complicated to check the gauge independence of < o1

all the graphs in fig. 11 shown below contribute as well as the graphs in fig. 1. however in
this case again, all the extra contributions can be shown to cancel within themselves.

in this article, we presented two loop computations of some gauge invariant two- and three-
point correlators in n =1 superspace. in accordance with the known non-renormalization

theorems, they vanish for operators at separate points. for component scalars, we check the
su(4) r-symmetry. since our results are consistent with n =4 supersymmetry so far, we
believe it is safe to use the lagrangian eq (1) for further computations.
