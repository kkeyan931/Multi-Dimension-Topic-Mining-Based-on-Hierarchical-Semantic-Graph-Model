abstract

we study the modular transformation properties of euclidean solutions of
3d gravity whose asymptotic geometry has the topology of a torus. these
solutions represent saddle points of the grand canonical partition function
with an important example being the btz black hole, and their properties
under modular transformations are inherited from the boundary conformal
eld theory encoding the asymptotic dynamics. within the chern simons
formulation, classical solutions are characterised by specic holonomies de-
scribing the wrapping of the gauge eld around cycles of the torus. we nd
that provided these holonomies transform in an appropriate manner, there
exists an associated modular invariant grand canonical partition function and
that the spectrum of saddle points naturally includes a thermal bath in ads3
as discussed by maldacena and strominger. indeed, certain modular transfor-
mations can naturally be described within classical bulk dynamics as mapping
between dierent foliations with a time coordinate along dierent cycles of
the asymptotic torus.

i. introduction

one of the regimes in which the correspondence [13] between string theory on anti-de
sitten space (ads) and conformal eld theory is under some measure of control is in the
case of ads3. in this example, there are no propagating gravitational modes in the bulk and
it has been known for some time [4] that the asymptotic dynamics of the gravitational eld,
with appropriate boundary conditions, induces a local conformal symmetry with central
charge,

ccl =

3l
2g

,

(1)

in which g is newtons constant and 2/l2 is the cosmological constant. the particular
asymptotic fall-o required as a boundary condition for the metric, for preservation of the
asymptotic isometry, is known [4] to be equivalent to the conformal treatment of innity
of penrose, and which was discussed in the context of the ads/cf t correspondence by
witten [3].

e, or an appropriate generalisation to include

as a consequence of the trivial bulk dynamics, it is well known that under these particular
boundary conditions, the asymptotic dynamics of the gravitational eld eectively reduces to
classical liouville theory [5] (see also [6]). then, as discussed by martinec [7], the ads/cf t
correspondence for the metricstress tensor sector may be rephrased in this example as
the semiclassical relation t liouville
correlators. liouville theory then describes the eective action for the weyl anomaly of the
cft arising from its coupling to the background geometry, encoded in the conformal ward
identities. in the approach of [7], the level density of liouville theory, equivalent to that of a
free boson, i.e. cef f = 1, is only a thermodynamic description of the microstates underlying
the cft associated with (1), and which would presumably also describe the microscopic
origin of bekenstein-hawking entropy of the btz black hole following the argument of [8].
the suggestion that the asymptotic gravitational dynamics encodes (or is induced by)
the current sector of an underlying cft presents a new avenue to investigate inter-relations
between classical bulk geometries and 2d cft notions such as uniformization theory and
modular invariance. the rst of these was investigated in [7]. recall that classical 3d
euclidean geometries may be realised as a quotient of euclidean ads3 by an element of
sl(2,c) , and that these matrices are equivalent up to conjugation to the holonomies of
the gauge eld describing the same classical solution within the chern simons formulation
of 3d gravity [9]. since the asymptotic boundary is necessarily a riemann surface, it was
shown in [7] that there is a correspondence between the conjugacy classes of holonomies
and particular uniformizing coordinates associated with classical liouville elds living on
the boundary.

the advantage of working with ads3 is that one may go beyond the semi-classical formu-
lation of the ads/cf t correspondence, working with small curvatures l  1, and consider
quantum corrections in the bulk, and thus subleading o(1/ccl) corrections in the boundary
cft. the second point noted above, the manifestation of modular invariance in terms of
classical bulk geometries, which will be the subject addressed in the present work, requires
an extension of this kind. as motivation, we note that in euclidean signature, the compact-
ied boundary of ads3 may be interpreted as a riemann sphere. in practice, one does not

2

need to assume this theory actually lives at the boundary, but keeping this analogy one may
recall that the presence of a cft on the plane generally implies the existence of a modular
invariant theory on the torus [10]. indeed, an asymptotic torus geometry is known to be
the topology associated with the euclidean btz black hole [11]. the question then arises
as to whether the btz black hole has an associated modular invariant partition function,
or indeed how modular transformations would manifest themselves in the bulk theory.

to explore this suggestion in more detail, we concentrate for the moment on the btz
black hole [11]. we may write the action in terms of standard thermodynamic quantities,
the average energy hei, spin hji , and entropy s, as i =  hei + hji  s. the classical
black hole partition function, ei, then takes the form

eibh = exp(cid:18)2i

ccl

24 (cid:18) 1
 

1

(cid:19)(cid:19) ,

(2)

where hei = m is the black hole mass,  is the inverse temperature,  is the angular
velocity, and  is a modular parameter (complex structure), given by [13]

 =



2 (cid:18) +

i

l(cid:19) .

(3)

in a recent analysis, maldacena and strominger [12] noted that another saddle point, which
one may interpret as a thermal bath in ads3, may be represented by the action i =  hei,
and has a classical partition function of the form

eit ads = exp(cid:18)2i

ccl
24

(   )(cid:19) ,

(4)

where hei is now interpreted as the ads3 mass, which importantly is negative. this re-
interpretation naturally corresponds to the rewriting of the full ensemble above via use
of the 3d smarr formula (m + j) + s = (m + j). it was observed in [12] that
these two solutions are related by the modular transformation   1/ , and that this
transformation corresponds to an analogous mapping in the element of sl(2,c) by which
they were constructed, leading to a conjecture that one should have a full sl(2,z) spectrum
of such solutions. this is plausible since both solutions above have the geometry of a solid
torus, while the radial coordinate actually decouples from the dynamics. thus the eective
theory is dened on a torus and, if conformal as understood above, one expects a modular
invariant partition function to exist. indeed it was noted in [12], that the dual conformal
eld theory was dened on the complex plane with specic identications analogous to the
identications used in constructing the bulk solutions.

since this modular invariant structure is associated with transformations of the quotient
sl(2,c) matrix, one expects that these features should also be apparent in the chern-
simons formalism as particular transformations on the holonomies of classical solutions. in
this paper we shall show that this is indeed the case, and that a natural way to picture the
eect of modular transformations such as   1/ at the classical level is as a mapping to
a new canonical 2+1 decompositions of the chern-simons action, where the time direction
is associated with dierent cycles of the asymptotic torus. on the other hand, at the level
of the cft, the holonomies of the classical gauge eld naturally enter via an appropriate
choice of basis for the asymptotic symmetry algebra. the modular invariance of the grand

3

canonical partition function [13] is conveniently made manifest by working with the chiral
wzw models associated with the gauge xed chern simons action. this choice of basis
then enters through the characters of the kac-moody algebra describing the wzw partition
function.

the layout of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we review the structure of asymptot-
ically toroidal solutions in 3d gravity, and construct a generic 2+1 decomposition in rst
order form. in section 3 we discuss the prominent role played by the dening holonomies in
determining the modular invariance properties of the grand canonical ensemble. we nish
in section 4 with some additional remarks on the semi-classical limit.

ii. general canonical decompositions

since classical solutions of 3d gravity have constant curvature, they can be represented

in terms of a quotient of the hyperbolic space (euclidean ads3)

l2ds2 = e2dwdw + d2,

(5)

by an element h of sl(2,c) , where w is a complex coordinate on the plane, the radial
coordinate is exp(), and l denotes the scale of the geometry.
in particular, we shall be
concerned here with asymptotically toroidal geometries, so that h = h( ) is diagonal, and
in the case of the btz black hole, given by

h =   ei/

0

0

ei/ ! .

this generates the identications,

   + i(cid:18) 1



+

1

(cid:19) ,

z  exp(cid:18)2i

1

(cid:19) z.

(6)

(7)

in this representation, the identication of the black hole boils down to the relation
between  and the physical variables  and . in particular, were one to invert the identi-
cation in (3), and identify these physical parameters with 1/ , then the classical solution
we have just described via identication of the hyperbolic space would correspond to a ther-
mal bath in ads3 [12] as discussed in the introduction. of course, it is equivalent to retain
the identication of  in (3) and instead to redene the identication matrix (6). this
ambiguity in interpretation re-enters when we consider the appropriate choice of boundary
conditions below.

the matrix h has a very natural interpretation in the chern-simons formulation. to see
this, we now recall that the einsteinhilbert action for riemannian geometries, discarding
invertibility for the dreibein (see [14]), may be rewritten as the dierence of two chern-
simons actions, with gauge group sl(2,c) [15],

ieh =

1

16g zm

g(cid:18)r +

2

l2(cid:19) = i(cid:16)i[a]  i[a](cid:17) + b,

(8)

where b is a boundary term. as noted in [17], the rst-order form has a sign ambiguity

associated with the relation g = e, where e is the determinant of the dreibein. the

4

choice xes the relative orientation of the orthonormal and metric frames, and we shall nd
it convenient to choose the (unconventional) negative sign (and e < 0), so that the chern-
simons level k, to be introduced shortly, will be positive. the gauge elds are then dened

in terms of the spin connection and dreibein as aa = a + iea/l, and aa = a  iea/l. the

gauge eld conguration corresponding to the euclidean black hole is given by

a = 

1

2  

dr

ierdz/

ierdz/ dr ! ,

(9)

where r is a proper radial coordinate, and z =  +  x0 in terms of the conventional real,
periodic, euclidean black hole coordinates. we note that the coordinate z naturally lives on
a cylinder and is related to the plane coordinate w by an exponential mapping, the explicit
form of which we shall not require. the crucial feature we wish to emphasize, is that the
global structure of the gauge eld is encoded in the identication matrix h (6). this follows
from the holonomies of (9) which are given by

p exp(cid:18)z

a(cid:19) = mhm 1,

(10)

where m is an sl(2,c) matrix. consequently, we should expect that the modular structure
of classical solutions will involve the gauge eld holonomies in a direct manner.

as we consider spacetimes which have the geometry of a solid torus, there are two natural
choices for the foliating coordinate to use in pursuing a 2+1 canonical decomposition, namely,
the contractible and non-contractible cycles. for generality we shall denote the choice of
foliation coordinate as u, and the coordinate along the other cycle as v. now, in formulating
a path integral representation for the grand canonical partition function, one needs to specify
boundary conditions which ensure that variations of the action are well dened, while also
dening the ensemble by xing certain physical quantities. this issue has recently been
considered in some detail in [18]. the main point to emphasize is that for the ensemble of
interest, the covariant form of the chern simons action requires no boundary terms at all!
in order to specify the boundary conditions, we now concretely dene  in terms of
physical quantities via (3), and reect dierent identications of the hyperbolic space, via
the sl(2,c) mapping  = (a + b)/(c + d). then we have z = v +  u and the boundary
conditions appropriate to this problem are chiral,

aa

z = 0,

aa

z = 0.

(11)

an important consequence of these relations, as noted in [16] and fully revealed in [17],
is that this condition links the real and imaginary parts of a at the boundary, where the
nonzero components are given by

aa

z = 2a
z ,

aa

z = 2a
z .

(12)

consequently, the sl(2,c) gauge eld reduces at the boundary to the two real su(2) cur-
rents above.

since the covariant chern-simons action requires no boundary terms, the general 2+1

decomposition with a = audu + aidxi then takes the form,

5

i[a,  ] =

k

4 z duz

ijt r (aiuaj + aufij) 

k

4 zt 2



t ra2
v,

(13)

where k = l/(4g) = ccl/6 so that with e < 0 both k and ccl are positive.
in fact, we
should mention that there is a subtlety1 if one chooses u = x0, in that the foliation becomes
degenerate at r = 0. this can be treated by removing a small disk r <  on which the
covariant action is well dened. however, we shall nd here that an additional source will
necessarily arise at r = 0, and resolve the degeneracy. thus, given this caveat, we shall work
generically with (13).

the sign of the boundary term depends on the choice of u, as a consequence of the
in this form, one takes the positive sign when u

antisymmetry of the boundary 2-form.
denotes the non-contractible cycle.

this representation is simply convenient for compactly expressing results associated with
dierent solutions and dierent foliating coordinates. in order to have some specic examples
we quote below the boundary conditions for the on-shell btz black hole and also the thermal
ads bath (t ads),

btz = ( u = x0,  = 

u = ,  = 1


tads = ( u = x0,  =  1
u = ,  = 



.

(14)

henceforth we shall focus our attention on these two euclidean saddle points as they have
a natural interpretation. for a specic choice of u, the transformation between boundary
conditions for each saddle point is just s :   1/ as one would expect from the discussion
of section 1. note also that if we switch between cycles in dening u, we also switch between
the two saddle points up to a sign. this sign change is accounted for by an analogous
change in the boundary term, and thus the form of the action is equivalent. this is not
surprising since, as discussed earlier, the geometry of these solutions as described by the
identication matrix h is equivalent up to a modular transformation of  . however, the
semiclassical regime in each case is quite dierent, with large black holes corresponding to
the limit ||  1, while a high temperature thermal bath corresponds to || >> 1. as a
consequence it was conjectured in [12] that since these solutions are euclidean saddle points
in the partition function there is a phase transition at some temperature separating phases
dominated by each saddle point. we shall show in the next section that there is a natural
grand canonical partition function which is indeed modular invariant and thus contains all
sl(2,z) related saddle points.

iii. the partition function and modular invariance

working within the class of asymptotically toroidal geometries we have the crucial sim-
plication that the sl(2,c) gauge eld reduces at the boundary to two real ane su(2)

currents at level k, whose components we denote again by {ai} and {ai}, with i = 1, 2, 3
and the su(2) conventions are [ta, tb] = iabct c with t r(tatb) = ab/2.

1we thank m. banados for remarks on this point.

for each of these elds, variation of au implies the constraint fij = 0, the most general
solution of which, for a manifold with nontrivial cycles such as the solid torus, is given by
[19]

a = g1dg + g1(u, v)g  (gg0)1d(gg0).

(15)

in this expression g is a single-valued group element, and  is a lie algebra-valued one-
form which need depend only on the coordinate parametrising the contractible cycle. with
the choice of gauge used in [13] and consistent with the boundary conditions of [4], the
dependence may be factored out of the group element and the exterior derivative above
reduces to a single v component. note, however, that this is a weaker constraint than that
required to reduce the asymptotic dynamics to liouville theory [5]. since 1(t 2) =zz is
commutative, the components of  may be rotated into the cartan subalgebra of the group
(t3). under large gauge transformations (modular transformations)  can change since it
encodes the holonomy of the gauge eld, and thus measures the wrapping around the non-
contractible cycle of the torus. this zero mode will play a vital role in determining the value
of the saddle point, and indeed the modular invariance properties, so its now convenient to
x u equal to the contractible cycle, so that  is present in the spatial slices. we shall
comment on the alternative choice in section 4.

in the conventional, operatorial, quantisation of chern-simons theory the zero-mode
factor g0 (or (u)) may be parametrised as an appropriately normalised wilson line. as
we noted above, the zero-mode sector of the gauge eld may be rotated into the cartan
subalgebra, and thus this wilson line may be represented as

g0 = p exp const z(u,v)

(u, v)a  t 3! ,

(16)

where a is a constant, and  is the abelian dierential of the torus. for concreteness, if one
chooses the holomorphic coordinates (z, z), then the lie algebra element may be written as
[20],

g1
0 dg0 =

ia

2im

t 3 

ia

2im

t 3.

(17)

the holomorphic abelian dierential is normalised so that r  = 2 and r  = 2 where

 and  are the contractible and non-contractible cycles respectively on the solid torus.

for example, the presence of this zero-mode in the black hole solution may be observed

by noting that the on-shell gauge eld has a non-vanishing t 3 component at r = 0,

a3|r=0 =

i

2im

(dz  dz),

(18)

which has precisely the form of (17) with a = a = 1. note that the sign of a is according to
convention and can be ignored.

in the partition function we are considering, this zero-mode characterises the particular
class of classical solutions we are interested in, and thus should be xed2. proceeding in this

2we note that quantisation of the zero mode as a quantum mechanical system was initially
discussed in [19,14]. this is of course important in theories without boundary, and see [21] (and
references therein) for a recent discussion of modular invariance in this context.

7

manner, the calculation of the partition function reduces to the construction of a specic
chern-simons state, i.e. with prescribed holonomies around the cycles of the torus [16]. note
that while a3
0 can be set to zero by a globally well-dened (large) gauge transformation, we
need to distinguish such modular transformations as they change the nature of the classical
solution, as discussed in the introduction.

with the zero-mode held constant in this way, one nds after solving the constraint, two
copies of a classical su(2) chiral wzw (cwzw) model for the group element gg0 at level
k. thus the full partition function factorises as

zsl(2,c)(,  ) = |zsu (2)( )|2.

(19)

as is well known, the cwzw lagrangian has the non-canonical form l = la(a) xa  h(x),
in which the symplectic structure is just the su(2) kac-moody algebra,

[t a

n , t b

m] = iab

c t c

n+m + n

k

abn+m,0,

where t a

n are the fourier components of the gauge eld,

av = g1vg =

2
k



xn=

t a
n einv.

(20)

(21)

the hamiltonian has the form h( ) = k tr(g1vg)2/(4), and thus the partition function
reduces to the expectation value of the above wilson line, parametrising the zero mode, in
the cwzw model characterised by the hamiltonian h( ),

zsu (2)( ) = hwricw zw ,

where wr = exp k

2 zs 1

r=0

a  t 3! ,

(22)

which depends only on the representation r since a is xed. the normalisation follows by
reference to the denition (21). one may now observe that this wilson line is precisely what
was interpreted as an additional boundary term in the analysis of [13]. we see here that it
arises naturally in the parametrisation of the zero-modes of the gauge eld.

the calculation of the partition function is then formally equivalent to the calculation
of a chern-simons state with a prescribed wilson line around the non-contractible cycle of
the solid torus. for large k (i.e. small curvatures) the ads/cf t correspondence relates the
classical saddle point for zsl(2,c)(,  )  eiinst to the boundary cft partition function.
however, we can now consider the generic structure for nite k, and given the factorisation
into su(2) currents at the boundary, one expects the partition function to be given by [22]

zsl(2,c) =

k

x2s=0

2s,k(a, )2s,k(a, ),

(23)

g = e. recall that as a consequence of (11) we have aa

where 2s,k(a,  ) are the characters for ane su(2), and s labels the spin of the represen-
tation. the shift in the sign of  arises from our initial choice of the frame orientation,
z/l at the boundary, and
n|0i = 0
n|0i = 0. the sign reversal

thus the in using (21) we are working with a minimum weight condition on states, t a
(n > 0), rather than the usual maximum weight condition, t a

z = 2iea

8

for  is simply a convenient means to re-orient the generators so that we may avoid this
subtlety in working with su(2) characters.

that (23) indeed arises in this case may be seen explicitly from the structure of the
hamiltonian h = h( ), and recalling that one may realise the conformal symmetry of the
model through the sugawara construction,

ln =

1
kq



xm=

: t a

mt a

nm : .

(24)

the virasoro generators ln are the fourier coecients of the energy-momentum tensor t (v)

(or appear via a laurent expansion t (w) = pn lnwn1 in the coordinates (w, w)). we

have introduced kq = k + cv, the quantum shifted level, where cv = 2 for su(2), which arises
in regularisation of the composite operator a2. then the su(2) partition function may be
expressed [13] as a sum over representations of

2s,k(a,  ) = trs(ws)ql0cq/(24) = trse2iat 3

0 ql0cq/(24),

(25)

where q = exp(2i ), which is indeed recognisable as the denition of an ane su(2)
character, in a particular basis associated with the weyl chamber of ane su(2). to see
this, recall that (see e.g. [23,24]) for an ane group, the root space is spanned in addition to
the root space of the nite lie group, by two additional generators 0 and . this is because
the maximal commuting set of generators now includes, along with the cartan subalgebra
of su(2), the canonical central element c, and the number operator d = l0. we denote
the basis vectors associated with these generators as 0 and . then, since su(2) has just
one simple root, with a basis vector , we can decompose any vector v in root space as,

v = 2i(a   0  b).

(26)

the notation we have used is consistent with our construction above, since we recall that the

character of a representation is given by r  p dimre where dimr is the multiplicity
of the weight  in the representation r. thus we see that a gives the coecient of t 3, while
 (or  in this case) is the coecient of the number operator, d = l0. the nal vector b
does not appear in the character above, but we shall comment on this shortly.
expressions for ane su(2) characters are well known (see e.g. [25,13]) as are their
properties under modular transformations [23]. the feature which will be of relevance here
is the role played by the zero mode of the gauge eld.

we consider the action of the generators of p sl(2,z) = sl(2,z)/z2 which we denote
s and t . their action on  is given by s :   1/ , and t :    + 1. 2s,k is known
to transform under t via a phase determined by the conformal dimensions of the primary
elds of the model [24,20]. of most interest here is the transformation under s. one nds,
with the particular action on the basis (26) described in [23], that 2s,k( , a, b) transforms
as follows:

2s,k

(2s + 1)(2x + 1)

k + 2

# 2x,k( , a, 0).

(27)

the particular form of the modular transformations we have used deserves some comment.
one sees that with a = b = 0, one recovers the standard action on  . the transformation

9

on a may be understood by recalling that it describes the holonomy of the gauge eld
around the non-contractible cycle of the torus. this is unchanged under t , but the cycles
ip under s, and thus for the holonomy to remain invariant, recalling the normalisation
of the abelian dierential, one requires the transformation above. in the introduction we
noted that the matrices generating classical solutions via a quotient of the hyperbolic space
are expected to be equivalent, up to conjugation by group elements, to the holonomies of
the gauge eld. thus it is not unexpected that the parameter a must transform under
modular transformations. finally, the basis element associated with the nal coordinate b
is associated with the lowest eigenvalue of l0, and thus the above shift reects a shift of this
kind. we shall return to this again shortly.

we can now conclude that the structure of the transformation properties under t and s
ensures that 2s,k form a unitary representation of the modular group and as a consequence
zsl(2,c), since it is given by (23) as a diagonal sum over the characters, will be modular
invariant [24,20,22]. consequently, the result necessarily contains an sl(2,z) spectrum of
saddle points associated with its invariance under the choice of  = (a + b)/(c + d),
provided we now restrict a, b, c, d z.
however, we should point out that this result relied on using a specic denition of
the modular transformation associated with transforming the coordinate b from zero to
a2/(2 ). this coordinate does not naturally appear in the black hole solution for example,
and thus it is more natural to assume that its xed to zero, and not modied by modular
transformations. if this denition is pursued one nds that modular invariance does not
hold due to an additional factor of

exp 2i

k
4

a2

 ! ,

(28)

which arises in the transformation law of 2s,k(, a). this is the factor that was previously
cancelled by the transformation of b. in the operatorial approach to chern-simons theories,
one usually recovers modular invariance by the addition of a prefactor exp(ka2/(4im ))
which one may readily check restores modular invariance for the sum over representations
of the combination,

m

2s,k( , a) = exp 

ka2

4im! 2s,k( , a).

(29)

however, one observes from the form of (28), that such a term would be cancelled if the
character were to be dened in terms of l0 + ka2/4 with a xed, rather than l0. with
the value of a = 1 associated with the on-shell black hole, one sees that this is a shift
l0  l0 + ccl/24 (cf. (1)).
we can understand this relation as a straightforward improvement term for the vira-
soro generators. to see this we recall that given the sugawara denition for the virasoro
generators above, it is then a standard argument based on conformal invariance that a mod-
ular invariant partition function may be dened by the diagonal sum of virasoro characters,

zv = xr,r

|v |2,

where

v = trr ql0c/24,

(30)

10

where r represents a highest weight module of the algebra, importantly, the latter relation
corresponds to a specic specialisation of the character, corresponding to the choice of a
basis with a component in the direction of l0. note that in general the character can be
dened by taking the trace of the exponential of a given element of the maximal abelian
subalgebra.

for the cwzw model, one nds that c = cq = kdim(g)/(k + cv) = 3k/(k + 2), and thus
in the semi-classical limit we have cq  3 for k  1. the asymptotic conformal symmetry
algebra discussed in the introduction, and associated with our choice of boundary conditions,
has ccl = 6k in terms of the su(2) level in the semi-classical limit, and thus does not directly
correspond to the construction above. indeed this is why quantising the wzw model (or
alternatively liouville theory) cannot directly explain the microstates associated with the
asymptotic conformal symmetry.

the relevant shift in the denition of the virasoro generators so that they realise the
asymptotic conformal symmetry with central charge  6k was discussed in the analysis of
[26]. this may be justied by demanding that the kac-moody currents transform with
conformal weight zero. this is not currently the case, and may be corrected by adding
an improvement term to the energy momentum tensor. this is always possible since
the virasoros are ambiguous up to the addition of diagonal elements of the algebra and
derivatives thereof. the general shift for ln implies that l0 = ccl/24, and this boosts the
total central charge appearing in the virasoro algebra to ctot = 3k/(k + 2) + 6k  6k which
agrees with the asymptotic conformal symmetry of [4]. of course, this modication has
not changed the hilbert space, as we have simply shifted the lowest eigenvalue of l0 [27].
thus we see that this shift is indeed the same as accounting for the zero mode contribution
to l0 associated with the classical black hole solution. in this sense this description does
not resolve the microstates, and the asymptotic level density is still described by a central
charge of o(1).

in other words, in the basis (, a) which we are using, the denition of the characters
under which they form a representation of the modular group corresponds to (29), and with
reference to the virasoro specialisation, it is then the presence of a 6= 0 which provides
the shift of the central charge to ctot = cq + ccl.
in a basis in which a is also set to
zero one then recovers the virasoro specialisation of the character (30) associated with the
combination l0  ctot/(24). in other words recovering modular invariance via the prefactor
(29) is analogous in this basis, to the shift l0  (l0  c/(24)) in the virasoro specialisation
which is known to restore modular invariance.
in particular, we see that the euclidean
saddle point is predominantly determined by the classical zero mode of the black hole
gauge eld conguration. this analysis also indicates the connection between the choice of
b, and the shift of the lowest eigenvalue of l0 as mentioned above.

iv. discussion

to summarise, we have shown that a generic 2+1 cananical decomposition in the chern-
simons formulation for euclidean toroidal geometries admits a natural modular invariant
partition function arising from the ane symmetry of these solutions. the grand canonical
ensemble thaus naturally contains a modular invariant spectrum of saddle points whose
dominance depends on the position in moduli space, ie. the choice of  . before making

some further concluding remarks on the semi-classical limit, we briey return to the issue of
the choice of foliation coordinate u, that was xed to be the contractible cycle in section 3
in order to focus on the role of the zero mode. if we choose this coordinate instead as the
non-contractible cycle, then the spatial integral includes no non-contractible cycles, and it
appears that one can set g0 =1 in (15). however, the global structure of the space essentially
ensures that this zero mode is recovered. we may see this by noting that there is a class of
gauge transformations, leaving the boundary conditions invariant, which have the following
form [20]

gm = exp(cid:26) i

2im

(m dz  m dz)(cid:27) ,

(31)

m g, g0  g0gm on the components of the gauge eld in (15).

and act as g  g1
in this
expression m labels the winding around the contractible cycle of the solid torus which is
appropriate for this angular foliation. now, in general one should set m = 0 since otherwise
these transformations would be singular at r = 0. however, this is not true if, as in our case,
there is a wilson line passing through the spatial slice [20], since in this case there is no
way to apply the transformation at the origin, and thus there is no singularity. consequently,
one is able to take such transformations into account, and there is no constraint requiring
g0 =1, as it can be modied by transformations such as (31). indeed we see that if this
choice is made initially, then g0  g0gm (31) generates precisely the the transform under
s :   1/, a  a/ of the black hole zero mode (18) if we identify m = a = a = 1.
thus the full partition function is independent of the choice of foliation as one would
expect. of course, if one only considers particular saddle points of the partition function
then dierent foliations are quite convenient.
indeed, we recall once more the intriguing
point that this zero mode structure is encoded at the level of classical saddle points by the
3d smarr formula, as illustrated in the introduction.

as an illustration of the utility of these results we now focus on the black hole sector, for
which its convenient to set  =  , and consider ||  0. in the virasoro specialisation, it is
a standard argument that the semi-classical limit of a modular invariant partition function
may be extracted by considering the transformation of coordinates, z  e2iz/ ,   e2i/ ,
appropriate for the ||  0 boundary of moduli space [10,28]. this leads to the saddle points
discussed in the introduction. its interesting that, although a similar argument based on
modular invariance could be applied to the km characters discussed here, a straightforward
extraction of this result follows by studying the asymptotic behaviour of the characters
for ||  0 as follows from their explicit representation in terms of functions [25,24,20].
recalling (23) and (29), we nd

which is the expected semi-classical limit for the black hole, and we have recalled that a = 1,
and ccl = 6k. the calculation may be performed along the lines of that in [13], although we
note that the diculties associated with working with a negative level k, and a non-compact
group, can now be circumvented [17]; details will appear elsewhere.

one may also observe that to recover thermal ads3 under a modular transformation, the
holonomy a = 1 should not transform. however, this is quite consistent since the thermal

12

ads3 solution needs the holonomy ipped to the other cycle of the torus, and this is achieved
by ensuring a remains invariant.

knowledge of the semi-classical saddle points for the partition function, and the on-shell
value of the modular parameter  , then allows a straightforward extraction of the entropy,
as s = (1  ) ln z, in agreement with the bekenstein-hawking value. however, we have
emphasised that the semi-classical contribution to the central charge which is necessary
to describe this density of states is implicit in the classical background solution, and we
have no microscopic picture of the contributing states. nonetheless, as we have seen, the
wzw picture is still helpful in unearthing relations between dierent classical solutions, as
a consequence of an underlying modular structure. we note in passing that there has been
a recent suggestion [29] that a more general class of asymptotic boundary conditions may
provide a purely gravitational description of the black hole microstates. this picture has
some connections with the worldsheet string perspective [30], and it would be interesting
to study the modular structure in this generalised context. the connection with string
theory also requires an extension to consider the sectors associated with dierent fermionic
boundary conditions, for which a related discussion has recently appeared in [31].
