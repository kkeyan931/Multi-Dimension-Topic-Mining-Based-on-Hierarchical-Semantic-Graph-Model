abstract

based on the renormalisability of the su(n) theory with massive gauge bosons, we start with the

path integral of the generating functional for the renormalized green functions and develop a method

to construct the scattering matrix so that the unitarity is evident. by using as basical variables the

renormalized eld functions and dening the unperturbed hamiltonian operator h0 that, under the

lorentz condition, describes the free particles of the initial and nal states in scattering processes, we

form an operator description with which the renormalized green functions can be expressed as the

vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized

eld functions, that satisfy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules. from

such an operator description we nd a total hamiltonian eh that determine the time evolution of

the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. the scattering matrix is nothing but

the matrix of the operator u (, ), which describes the time evolution from  to  in the

interaction picture specied by eh and h0, respect to a base formed by the physical eigen states of

h0. we also explain the asymptotic eld viewpoint of constructing the scattering matrix within our

operator description. moreover, we nd a formular to express the scattering matrix elements in terms

of the truncated renormalized green functions.

i. introduction

although the su(n) theory with a mass term of the gauge elds was considered to be in general

nonrenormalisable for a long time, it was repeatedly studied (see for example refs. [1-8]). in particular,

we have proven the renormalisability of the theory under the original expression of the mass term of the

gauge elds [8]. therefore it becomes possible to to deeply studied the scattering matrix of such theories.

in the present paper, instead of checking the negative arguments concerning the unitarity we will develop

a method to construct the scattering matrix with the renormalized eld functions as basical variables so

that the unitarity is evident.

owing to the renormalisability of theory, one can start with the path integral of the generating

functional for the renormalized green functions and form an operator description with the renormalized

eld functions as basical variables. this means that the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld

functions satisfy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules and the renormalized green

functions can be expressed as the vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of such heisenberg

eld operators. on the other hand starting from the path integral of the generating functional for the

unrenormalized green functions, one can form another operator description with the bare eld functions

as basical variables. it should be emphasized that such two operator descriptions are of dierent types. in

particular, the eld operators belonging to the two operator descriptions operate on dierent state spaces

and can not be transformed into each other by unitary transformations or by scale transformations.

according to the very idea of renormalisation we decide to choose the rst kind of operator de-

scription. with the renormalized eld functions and the renormalized parameters we will dene a non-

interacting lagrangian l0 which, under the lorentz condition, describes the free particles of the initial

and nal states in scattering processes. next we will nd an unperturbed hamiltonian h0 operation in a

way used in the gupta-bleuler quantization and dene a quasi-gupta-bleuler subspace (qgb) which is

spanned by all the physical eigen states of h0. by giving an operator expression for the generating func-

tional for the green functions of the free elds, we will able to do the same for the generating functional

for the renormalized full green functions. then we can express the renormalized green functions as the

vacuum expectations of the time odered products and nd the total hamiltonian eh that determine the

time evolution of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. with the qgb subspace

and the operator u (, ), which describes the time evolution from  to  in the interaction picture

specied by eh and h0, we can easily dene the scattering matrix and make the unitarity evident.

the operator description will be given in section 2. in section 3 we will explain the denition and

2

the unitarity of the scattering matrix and briey describe the asymptotic eld viewpoint based on our

operator description. in section 4 a formular will be found to express the scattering matrix elements

in terms of the truncated renormalized green functions. concluding remarks will be given in the nal

section.

ii. operator description with renormalized eld functions as basical variables

assume that the theory has been renormalized under a proper renormalization scheme so that the

renormalized parameters such as the masses represent the physical ones. the generating functional for

the renormalized green functions can be expressed as

z [r][j, , , , ] =

1

n z d[a, , , , ] ya,x

 (aa(x)) expni(cid:0)i e + is(cid:1)o ,

(2.1)

where aa, a, a and ,  stand for the renormalized gauge elds, ghost elds and material elds, all

the parameters are also renormalized ones, n is a constant to make z [r][0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, is is the

source term

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)

is =z d4x(cid:2)j 

+a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3) .

the action i e contains the counterterm and is formed by the following lagrangian

le = 

fa f 

a +

1
4

a + l + la

m 2aaa

1
2
abb(x) + lcount .

+(cid:0)  a(x)(cid:1)d

(2.2)

the free evolution of the physical particles of the initial and nal states in scattering processes should be

described by combining the lorentz condition with the lagrangian

l0(x) = 

1
4

f [0]
a f [0]

a

+

1
2

where

m 2aa(x)a

a (x) + l(x) +(cid:0)  a(x)(cid:1)d

abb(x) ,

in order to describe such free particles by an operator method, we replace (2.3) by

f [0]

a = aa   aa .

el0(x) = lgb(x) +

1
2

m 2aa(x)a

a (x) + l(x) +(cid:0)  a(x)(cid:1)d

abb(x) ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

where lgb(x) is a guptableuler lagrangian

lgb(x) = 

1
4

f [0]
a f [0]

a



1

2(cid:0)aa(cid:1)2

.

then we perform a canonical quantization with el0(x) and dene the corresponding hamiltonian operator

h0 and eld operators. moreover we have to choose the so-called physical states and dene a physical

initial-nal state subspace according to lorentz condition and the residual symmetry. this subspace

is spanned by all the physical eigen states of h0 and can be formed in a similar method used in the

guptableuler quantization although there are dierences caused by the gauge eld mass term (see the

appendix or ref.

[9]). we will simply call such a subspace as quasi-gupta-bleuler or qgb subspace.

if we can nd a total hamiltonian which determines the time evolution of the heisenberg operators of

the renormalized eld functions, we will be able to construct the scattering matrix with the help of the

qgb subspace and the time evolution operators u (, ) which describes the time evolution from 

to + in the interaction picture dened by the total hamiltonian and h0. it will be seen that these

tentative ideas are correct. however, we will have to introduce the gauge xing term and construct

an appropriate operator expression for the generating functional for the renormalized green functions.

with the help of the the gauge xing term lgf =  1

one can express (2.1) as

z [r][j, , , , ] = lim
0

z [r]



2(cid:0)aa(cid:1)2

[j, , , , ] ,

where

z [r]



[j, , , , ] =

where n is a constant to make z [r]



1

n z d[a, , , , ]expni(cid:0)ie + is(cid:1)o ,
ie = i e +z d4xlgf (x) .

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1, and

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

needles to say, quantities dened by using z [r]



[j, , , , ] depend on , but this parameter will often

be omitted.

let ez 0[j, , , , ] be the generating functional for the green functions dened by the eective

1

lagrangian el0, namely
n0 z d[a, , , , ] ya,x
ez 0[j, , , , ] =
ez 0[j, , , , ] = h0|texpniz d4x(cid:2)j 

where n0 is a constant to make ez0[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. one thus has

a (x)aa(x)

 (aa(x)) expni(cid:0)z d4xel0(x) + is(cid:1)o ,

+ a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o|0i ,

(2.8)

4

where aa(x),a(x),a(x),   are eld operators satisfying the usual equal time commutation or anti-

commutation rules and their time evolution are determined by h0. the state |0i is the eigen state of h0

belonging to the lowest eigenvalue (assigned to be zero). dene ehi so that

ie = z d4xehi (x) +z d4xel0(x) .

then one gets from (2.6)

ia (x) respectively. the operator ehi appearing in the last line is obtained from the classical

quantity by replacing the eld functions with operators aa(x), a(x), a(x), a(x) and a(x) and

and











then taking the normal products with respect to |0i. each of the two proportion coecients in (4.10)
should make z [r]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. it is evident that the time evolution of ehi is determined by h0:



ehi (t) = eih0t ehi (0)eih0t .
t expn  i z d4x ehi (x)o

is the time evolution operator u (, ) in the interaction picture dened by h0 and the interaction

therefore, the operator

r d3xehi (0), namely

and

t expn  iz d4x ehi (x)o = u (, ) ,
u (t, t0) = eih0teieh(tt0)eih0t0 ,
eh = h0 +z d3xehi (0) .
[j, , , , ]  h 0 |u (, 0)(cid:16)t expniz d4xhj

it follows that (2.10) can be written as

a(x) + a(x)h

(2.13)

(2.15)

the proportion coecient should make z [r]



[0, 0, 0, 0, 0] equal to 1. the time evolution of the operators

h

a(t) = eiehtaa(0)eieht ,
a (t) = eiehta(0)eieht ,
a(t) = eiehta(0)eieht ,
a (t) = eiehta(0)eieht ,
a(t) = eiehta(0)eieht .

h

therefore eh is the total hamiltonian operator and ah

heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. thus (2.15) means that the renormalized green

a(x), h

a (x), h

a(x), h

a (x) and 

h
a(x) stand for the

functions can be expressed as the vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of the heisenberg

operators of the renormalized eld functions. it should be emphasized that these eld operators satisfy

the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules.

iii. the scattering matrix

one can choose to specify the initial condition at t =  or at t = + for state vectors in the

interaction picture and constructing the scattering theory. therefore for an arbitrary state |gbi in the

qgb subspace there is a state |

gbi in this subspace so that

u (t, )|

gbi = u (t, )|gbi .

(3.1)

conversely, for an arbitrary state |

gbi  qgb, there is a state |gbi  qgb that satises this

equation. next, states u (t, )|gbi are normalized just like |gbi one thus has

u (, t)u (t, )|gbi = |gbi .

(3.2)

this and (3.1) also indicate that the operators u (, ) conserve invariant the qgb subspace. we

therefore express the elements of the scattering matrix as

sf i = lim
0

hf |u (, )|ii
h0|u (, )|0i

,

(3.3)

where |ii and |f i are within the qgb subspace and are the eigen states of h0.

from (3.1) and (3.2), for an arbitrary state |gbi  qgb one has

u (0, )|gbi = u (0, )|

gbi ,

6

u (, )|gbi = |

gbi ,

u (, )|

gbi = |gbi .

thus,

u (, )u (, )|gbi = u (, )|

gbi = |gbi .

similarly for arbitrary |

gbi  qgb,

u (, )u (, )|

gbi = |

gbi .

these ensure the unitarity of the scattering matrix.

with the help of the time evolution operator in the interaction picture we can also dene the operators

of so-called asymptotic elds which will be denoted by aa,in(x), aa,out(x), a,in(x) and a,out(x),   .

these are free elds, and when t is very large each in-operator proportional to the heisenberg operator

of the renormalized eld function. actually each proportion coecient should be equal to 1 in order not

to destroy the usual equal time commutation or anticommutation rules. on the other hand when t is

very large each out-operator is equal to the heisenberg operator of the renormalized eld function. using

ah

a(x) = u (0, t)aa(x)u (t, 0) ,

h

a (x) = u (0, t)a(x)u (t, 0) ,

h

a (x) = u (0, t)a(x)u (t, 0) ,

and noticing that when |t| is large enough, u (0, t) and u (t, 0) are independent of t, one gets

aa,in(x) = u (0, )aa(x)u (, 0) ,

a,in(x) = u (0, )a(x)u (, 0) ,

aa,out(x) = u (0, )aa(x)u (, 0) ,

a,out(x) = u (0, )a(x)u (, 0) .

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

since the asymptotic elds are free ones, these are valid for any t. the formulae for the other elds are

similar.

if the instates and outstates are dened by

|0, in i =

|0, out i =

u (0, )|0i

,

ph 0|u (, )|0 i
ph 0|u (, )|0 i

u (0, )|0i

,

7

|i, in i =

|i, out i =

u (0, )|ii

,

ph 0|u (, )|0 i
ph 0|u (, )|0 i

u (0, )|ii

,

then (3.9) can be written as

sf i = lim
0

hf, out|i, ini = lim
0

h f, in|u (0, )u (, 0)|i, in i .

(3.8)

iv. an expression for the scattering matrix elements in terms

of the truncated renormalized green functions

in the following we will derive a formula to express the elements of the scattering matrix in terms of

the truncated renormalized green functions. dene the following operator

u (j, , , , ) = t(cid:16)u (, )expniz d4x(cid:2)j 

a (x)aa(x) + a(x)a(x)

+a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o(cid:17) .

(4.1)

we thus have

and

u (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) = u (, ) ,

h0|u (j, , , , )|0i/(cid:0)h0|u (, )|0i(cid:1) = z [r]



[j, , , , ] .

(4.2)

analogous to (2.10), we also have

+a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)(cid:3)o .

dene hi (x) and l

[10]. this is the formular we need. in the above manipulation, we have taken into account the fact that

the momenta of the particles in the initial or nal states are on the mass shell and for such momenta the

renormalized full propagators become the free propagators.

v. concluding remarks

starting from the path integral of the generating functional for the renormalized green functions

with the renormalized eld functions as basical variables and using the unperturbed hamiltonian operator

that, under the lorentz condition, describes the free particles of the initial and nal states in scattering

processes, we have formed a satisfying operator description and found the total hamiltonian which

determine the time evolution of the heisenberg operators of the renormalized eld functions. with the

help of the time evolution operator u (, ) in the interaction picture and of the quasi-gupta-bleuler

subspace formed by the physical initial-nal states, we have been able to easily explain the denition and

the unitarity of the scattering matrix and found a formular to express the matrix elements in terms of

the truncated renormalized green functions.

we have also briey described the asymptotic eld viewpoint based on our operator description. it

would be interesting to compare such a viewpoint with that of the traditional asymptotic theory [11 14].

appendix the gupta-bleuler subspace of initial-final states

as was pointed out in section 2, the particles in the initial or nal states are described by the following

lagrangian and lorentz condition:

l0 = 

1
4

f [0]
a f [0]

a

+

1
2

aa = 0 ,

m 2aaa

a + l (cid:0)a(x)(cid:1)a(x) ,

(a1)

(a2)

according to the operator description in the text of this paper we should keep the ghost term in equation

(a1) and form the initial-nal state subspace by following the gupta-bleuler quantization method. to

this end we rst use the lorentz and modify (a1) into

el0(x) = lgb(x) +

1
2

m 2aa(x)a

a (x) + l(x) (cid:0)a(x)(cid:1)a(x) ,

(a3)

where the gupta-bleuler lagrangian lgb(x) can be written as

lgb(x) = 

1

2(cid:0)aa(cid:1)(cid:0)a
a(cid:1) .

then we disregard the lorentz condition and perform a canonical quantization with el0(x) and dene the

corresponding hamiltonian operator h0 and eld operators. moreover we have to choose the so-called

physical states and dene a physical initial-nal state subspace with the help of the lorentz condition

and the residual symmetry. we certainly expect the ghost particles to be excluded from appearing in the

initial-nal states.

the restriction of the lorentz condition on a physical state |phi can be expressed as

kaa(k)|phi = 0

(k0 = (|k|)) .

for a single particle state with the polarization vector (k)

eq. (16) gives

(k, )a

a(k)|0i

k(k, ) = 0 .

according to this condition two transversal polarization states ( = 1, 2) and a longitudinal polarization

state ( = 3) are allowed to be present for each k.

since a(x) = 0 the theory we are treating is invariant under the innitesimal transformation

aa(x) = a(x) ,

a(x) = 0 ,

a(x) = 0 ,

(x) = 0 ,

(a19)

where  is an innitesimal fermionic real constant. similarly, since a(x) = 0 the theory is also

invariant under the transformation

aa(x) = a(x) ,

a(x) = 0 ,

a(x) = 0 ,

(x) = 0 .

(a20)

this is the residual symmetry mentioned above. under such a kind of transformations a physical state

should become a equivalent state. particularly (k, )a

a(k)|0i should be equivalent to zero, where

a

a(k) is determined by

or by

from (a21), one has

where the components of ek are

similarly from (a22), one has

aa(x) = (cid:2)a(cid:3)t=0 ,

aa(x) = (cid:2)a(cid:3)t=0 .

a

a(k) = iekp/|k|c 

a(k) .

ek0 = |k| ,

ekl = kl .

it follows that c 

a(k)|0i and c


a(k)|0i should be equivalent to zero.

a

a(k) = iekp/|k|c


a(k) .

in conclusion, the initial-nal state subspace is formed by all the physical states. a physical state

can only contain material particles, transversal polarization or longitudinal polarization gauge bosons

and not ghost particles.
