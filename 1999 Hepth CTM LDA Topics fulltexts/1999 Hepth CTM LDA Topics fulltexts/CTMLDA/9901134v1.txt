abstract

we test the ads/cft correspondence in the case of a d = 4 n = 2 scft
by comparing chiral anomalies which are of order n in the t hooft large n
limit. these include corrections of order 1/n to the conformal anomaly, thus
testing the correspondence beyond the extreme large n limit. the eld theory
anomalies are reproduced by terms in the 7-brane eective action in the bulk.

1. introduction and summary

over the past year much evidence has accumulated for the conjecture of [1] relating
d-dimensional conformal eld theories with compactications of string theory or m theory
including adsd+1. the simplest example of the correspondence is the duality between the
d = 4 n = 4 su (n ) sym theory and type iib string theory compactied on ads5  s5.
this duality relates the su (n ) gauge theory with coupling y m  /2 + 4i/g2
y m to
the type iib compactication with a string coupling s  /2 + i/gs = y m and with n
units of 5-form ux on the s5, leading to a radius of curvature r  (gsn )1/4ls  n 1/4lp.
the correlation functions of local operators in the conformal eld theory are related [2,3]
to the response of string theory on ads to various boundary conditions.

in eld theory, it is well-known that correlation functions have a 1/n expansion based
on the double-line representation of their feynman diagrams [4] (see [5] for a review). this
expansion is valid in the limit of taking large n and small gy m while keeping   g2
y m n
nite. a diagram with genus g comes with a power n 22g as well as some power of
. for su (n ) theories with adjoint elds only closed orientable surfaces appear, so the
perturbative expansion is a double expansion in powers of 1/n 2 and , in which the leading
term (corresponding to the planar diagrams) is of order n 2.

in the dual ads theory we nd a similar result in the t hooft limit of large n with
nite   gsn . in general, correlation functions in the ads5  s5 string theory are given
by a double expansion in gs and /r2  1/2. in the t hooft limit we can write this
instead as an expansion in powers of 1/n  gs(/r2)2 where each coecient has an
expansion in powers of 1/2; obviously a term of some order in the gs expansion will
have the same order in the 1/n expansion. since the type iib string theory includes only
closed oriented strings we nd the same general structure as in the eld theory, with each
correlation function having an expansion in powers of 1/n 2, in which each coecient is
some function of .

the functions of  have dierent expansions from the point of view of the eld theory
and of the string theory, but both expansions are supposed (if the ads/cft correspon-
dence is correct) to give rise to the same function of  at each order in 1/n 2. the fact
that one expansion is in powers of  while the other is in powers of 1/ means that the
ads/cft correspondence is a strong/weak coupling duality in this case. since we do not
know how to make computations to arbitrary order in , this means that only correlation
functions which do not depend on  can be compared to test the duality. many such tests
have been done by now for terms of order n 2, which on the ads side may be computed
from tree-level supergravity. however, it is important to test this matching also at higher

orders in 1/n in order to make sure that the duality of [1] indeed holds also for nite n

and not just in the large n limit (some evidence for this was provided in [6,7]). as far as

we know, the only computations performed up to now of higher order terms (in 1/n ) have

involved instanton corrections [8,9,10,11] (some other corrections were recently discussed

but not explicitly computed in [12]).

the simplest correlation functions which do not depend on  are those which corre-

spond to global anomalies. namely, when we put the theory in backgrounds corresponding

to curved space or to gauge elds coupling to the global currents, some of the global cur-

rents are no longer conserved due to anomalies, and the coecients in the expressions for
this are integers so they cannot depend on . in the n = 4 theory there are two such
anomalies, which were both successfully matched to leading order in 1/n 2. the anomaly
involving three su (4)r currents was discussed in [3,13], and the conformal anomaly was
discussed in [14]. in the su (n ) sym theory both anomalies are proportional to n 2  1,
and the order n 2 term has been matched, while it is not known how to derive the order
1 term on the ads side (because of our lack of control over the string loop corrections in

this case; note that in general it is easy to obtain the exact expressions for the anomalies

on the eld theory side, but it is non-trivial to get them on the string theory/m theory
side). since the comparison of the terms of order 1/n 2 compared to the leading term
seems to be dicult, we would like to examine situations where there exist also corrections

of order 1/n . in this paper we compute some corrections of this order and show that they

agree between the eld theory and the string theory, providing further evidence for the

ads/cft correspondence at nite n .

from the string theory point of view it is clear that in order to get diagrams of order

1/n one must have either open string diagrams or non-orientable diagrams. this is well-

known also in the eld theory analysis of the t hooft limit, where looking at so(n )

or u sp(2n ) gauge theories leads to non-orientable diagrams with contributions of order

1/n , while adding matter in the fundamental representation (but not in bi-fundamental

representations) leads to diagrams with boundaries which also have contributions of order

1/n . on the ads side such corrections can occur due to orientifolds which lead to the

inclusion of non-orientable worldsheets, or due to d-branes which lead to worldsheets with

boundaries.

note that in all cases of orbifolds and orientifolds the comparison of the anomalies
in the leading n 2 order is straightforward. for example, it was shown in [15] that the
leading term in the conformal anomaly on the ads side is inversely proportional to the
volume of the compact space, so that for a zk orientifold or orbifold the leading term is k

times the n = 4 result. this obviously agrees with the eld theory analysis of d3-branes
on codimension 6 z2 orientifolds [16] which lead to so(2n ), so(2n  1) or u sp(2n )
gauge theories (with a leading anomaly of order 2n 2), and with the analysis of d3-branes
on codimension 4 zk orbifolds [17] which correspond to su (n )k gauge theories (with a
leading anomaly of order kn 2).

in particular, the analysis of [14,15] shows that the supergravity computation always

leads to the two coecients appearing in the conformal anomaly (usually denoted by a

and c) being equal to each other, so that duals with a useful supergravity limit can exist

only for theories for which a = c to leading order in 1/n . we will show that when higher

order corrections are taken into account this no longer has to hold, so the constraint a = c

is only required at the leading order in 1/n (of course, there could also be cases of the

duality which have no good supergravity approximation, in which case there is no obvious

relation between a and c).

the simplest case where an order 1/n correction to anomalies exists is the near-

horizon limit of d3-branes on an orientifold 3-plane analyzed in [16]. however, in this
case the correction on the string theory side comes from an rp 2 diagram which, to our
knowledge, has not been computed yet. therefore, we will focus here on the next simplest
case, which is the near-horizon limit of d3-branes on a z2 orientifold 7-plane (with 8 d7-
branes stuck on the orientifold to ensure conformal invariance). the n = 2 superconformal
eld theory corresponding to this case was analyzed in [18,19,20,21] and its string theory

dual was analyzed in [22,23]. we will see that in this case we can compute some of the

order 1/n corrections on the string theory side as well as on the eld theory side, by using
the eective d7-brane action (whose leading terms are of order 1/gs  n instead of the
1/g2
s  n 2 appearing in the sugra action), and we will show that the string theory
and eld theory results agree to this order. we have not been able to compute all of

the anomalies to this order, and in particular we do not know how to directly reproduce

the conformal anomaly, but it is related by supersymmetry to the anomaly terms that we

do compute, so supersymmetry guarantees that the conformal anomaly also agrees. our

results may presumably be generalized also to the other cases involving d7-branes and

orientifolds which were discussed in [22,23], for which it is not known how to compute the

anomalies on the eld theory side, so the string theory computation is a prediction of what

these anomalies should be.

in section 2 we describe the model and the anomalies of its u (1) r-current from the

eld theory point of view.

in section 3 we analyze how these anomalies are related to

chern-simons (cs) terms in the eective action of the d7-branes. the results of sections

2 and 3 are compared in section 4. this requires a careful xing of the normalizations,
which involves a comparison of the two-point correlation functions of the r-current and
the avor current as computed in the eld theory and as computed via the ads/cft
correspondence. unless stated otherwise, we will use the conventions of [24].

2. anomalies in the n = 2 superconformal field theory

the model we are considering is the one constructed in [20,21], namely the low-energy
theory on the worldvolume of n d3-branes sitting inside eight d7-branes coincident on
an orientifold 7-plane. this theory is dual [22,23] to type iib string theory on ads5  x 5
where x 5  s5/z2; the local operators in the eld theory can be thought of as living on
mink(3,1)=(ads5). the d7-branes (and the orientifold 7-plane) are wrapped around an
s3 which is the xed point locus of the z2 orientifold inside x 5, and also ll the whole of
ads5. the low-energy theory in the bulk of ads5 includes the gauged su (2)r  ur(1)
n = 4 supergravity, coupled to so(8)  su (2)l vector multiplets. further details about
these models and their dual string theory description are in [22,23]. some aspects relevant
for our discussion will be reviewed below. the ur(1) symmetry whose anomalies we study
is the one in the inclusion

so(6)  so(4)  ur(1)  su (2)r  su (2)l  ur(1)

(2.1)

of the isometry group of s5/z2 in the isometry group of s5.

the eld theory we are analyzing is a d = 4, n = 2 gauge theory with a u sp(2n )

gauge group and with the following eld content:

vector multiplets

hypermultiplets

(adjoint)

n(2n + 1)
4  2n
n(2n  1)  1 (antisymmetric, traceless).

(fundamentals)

(2.2)

its global symmetry is su (2)r  su (2)l  so(8)  ur(1), where su (2)r  ur(1) is the
r-symmetry (which is part of the n = 2 superconformal algebra). here we concentrate on
anomalies of the ur(1) r-current r. the form of the unique anomaly-free r current
is specied by the r-charges for the vector multiplet fermions i, i = 1, 2 (q = +1), the
bosons  (q = +2) in the vector multiplets, and the matter (hypermultiplet) fermions
 ,  (q = 1):

r =

1
2

i5i 

1
2

( 5 + 5 )  2i d.

(2.3)

the factor 1/2 in front of the fermion bilinears is due to the fact that i,  and  are
majorana spinors.

the current (2.3) is anomalous when the theory is coupled to gravity. the anomaly
can be calculated using the general result of [25]: a single weyl fermion with u (1) charge
q contributes to the anomaly as

where

h(gr)i =

q
3842 ( rr),

( rr) =

1
2

r.

for the model we are considering, we nd

h(gr)i =

2(1  6n )

3842

( rr).

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

for n = 2 susy theories the one-loop result (2.6) is not renormalized1. as required
by supersymmetry, which relates h(gr)i and the conformal anomaly hgti, the
coecient is proportional to a  c = (1  6n )/24, where hgti = ae4  ci4, and
e4 and i4 are (proportional to) the euler density and the square of the weyl tensor,
respectively (see e.g. [14,15]). note that a and c are both of order n 2 in the large n limit
(as computed for the n = 4 case in [14]), so this coecient involves corrections of order
1/n compared to the leading term in a and c.

in addition to the above gravitational contribution to the anomalous divergence of
the u (1)r current, there is also a contribution from the hrjji triangle diagram, where j
is the so(8) avor current, if we couple the theory to external so(8) gauge elds. since
only the quark hypermultiplets are charged under so(8), this gives

h(gr)i =

2n
162 ( f f ),

(2.7)

where ( f f ) = 1
2 tr(f  f ), f = f ata, and the trace is taken in the fundamental
representation. we will x the normalization of the so(8) generators later by comparing
the eld theory two-point function of the so(8) avor current with the two-point function
computed from string theory using the ads/cft correspondence. combining the two
contributions (2.6) and (2.7) gives, to leading order in 1/n ,

h(gr)i = 

n
322 [( rr)  4( f f )].

(2.8)

1 note that, in contrast to generic n = 1 theories, the r-current which is in the super-multiplet

of currents is also the one which satises the adler-bardeen theorem.

3. anomalies from five-dimensional chern-simons terms

we will now show how the r-current anomalies can be obtained from the string

theory dual of this theory. our procedure will be completely analogous to the one used in

[3]  the anomalies will be related to chern-simons terms in the ve-dimensional eective

action. chern-simons terms can arise both from the dimensionally reduced d = 10 type

iib supergravity and from the 7-brane/orientifold plane system. the former gives possible
anomalous contributions to hr3i and hrj 2i, where j s are the su (2) currents. they
are of order n 2 in the large n expansion (since the whole d = 10 supergravity action is
of this order). we will not consider them here. the second source for cs terms are the
d7-branes and the orientifold plane, which are both wrapped around an s3. as we shall
see these terms are of order n .

we now focus on the ve-dimensional terms which arise from dimensional reduction

of the chern-simons terms, which appear in the world-volume action of the 7-branes, on
the internal s3. the cs terms for a general dp-brane are [26]

pz c q a(42r) tr(e2f )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p+1

,

(3.1)

where p is the charge of a single dp-brane, c = p c(n) is the sum over the antisymmetric

form rr elds present in the theory and2 f = f at a is the eld strength of the gauge
elds on the dp-brane. in our case these are the so(8) gauge elds. the trace is in the

fundamental representation. the orientifold plane also gives rise to cs terms on the brane

world-volume. they have recently been determined to be [27,28]

pz c q l(2r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p+1

,

(3.2)

where p is the charge of an orientifold p-plane. we have suppressed possible contributions
from the (ns,ns) b-eld and also the contribution from the normal bundle, which are of

no relevance for our considerations. up to the required order,

2 note that we distinguish between ta in eq. (2.7) and t a here. their relative normalization

will be xed in section 4.

first, we would like to determine the coecients p and p. before we take the near-
horizon limit, the model we are considering is t-dual, say along the x8, x9 directions, to the
type i string [18], which has one space-lling orientifold plane and 32 nine-branes. after
t-duality we have four orientifold 7-planes and 32 seven-branes. this model is equivalent
to type iib on mink(7,1)t 2/(i89  (1)fl  ) where  is the world-sheet parity and
i89 : (x8, x9)  (x8, x9) (see [18] for details), which in turn is f theory on a particular
k3. f theory [29] has 24 7-branes. in our setting four pairs of mutually non-local seven-

branes combine to four orientifold planes. the remaining 16 d7-branes are equivalent
to the 32 seven-branes in the type i description. the seven-branes, which are t-duals

of the type i nine-branes, thus each have half the charge of a type iib d7-brane, i.e.
p = 1/[2(2)p()(p+1)/2]. this can also be shown by carefully tracing the brane tension
i
through t-duality: due to the fact that in the type i theory there are only unoriented
9 . t-dualizing on t 2 with radii r gives, by
ii
strings, one has (see e.g.

thus, with eight d7-branes3 and one orientifold 7-plane one obtains from (3.1) and

(3.2) the terms

12852 z c(4)  tr(f  f ).

(3.4)

the orientifold 7-plane contributes to the second term only insofar as it leads to an or-

thogonal rather than a unitary gauge group on the d7-branes.

next, we need to rescale the 4-form eld to agree with the conventions used in the
ads literature (for instance in [31] which we will use in section 4). the ten-dimensional

supergravity low-energy eective bulk action is

s =

where 22

self-duality of f(5) has to be imposed as an additional constraint. the ten-dimensional

exponent, which is tr(e2f ) = 8 + 1

particular, implies f 2

involves the ten-dimensional metric and the self-dual ve-form eld strength. due to the
presence of the seven-branes, the solution is not ads5  s5 but rather ads5  x 5, which
is dual to the eld theory described above. the metric is

where d2
5 is the metric on x 5  s5/z2. the ve-form eld is fabcde = 322n abcde
and fmnpqr = 322n mnpqr, with components along the x 5 and the ads5 directions,
respectively. abcde and mnpqr are the volume forms of x 5 and ads5, rescaled to radius
one. note the replacement n  2n as compared to the ads5  s5 solution. this is
12 rx 5 f(5) = 2n rather than 12 rs 5 f(5) = 2n ,
due to the fact that we require
and vol(x 5) = 1
2 vol(s5). to match with the normalizations used in section 4, where we
use supergravity results which were derived in a normalization where the overall radius
of the space is one (rather than 1/2(8gsn )1/4), and where f(5) is scaled such that the
einstein equations take the form rm n = 1
(5))m n , we rescale the four-form potential
c(4)  322n c(4). after this rescaling, eq. (3.4) becomes

n

44 z c(4)  tr(f  f ) .

(3.7)

to get the cs terms of the d = 5 theory, we have to integrate this expression over
s3, the xed locus of the z2 action, which the 7-branes are wrapped around. let us recall
from [32] that the u (1)r gauge boson arm is a linear combination of two kaluza-klein
modes bm and m, one coming from the metric components gma and the other from the
c(4) eld,

gma  bm(x)ya(y) ,

here x and y are coordinates on ads5 and on x 5, respectively, and ya(y) is a vector
spherical harmonic on x 5 which we now construct.

from [32] it follows that the combination am  bm  16m is a massless vector eld,
whereas vm  bm + 8m is a massive eld. we will set vm to zero in the following. up to
a normalization, which we will x in section 4, am is the u (1)r gauge eld. denoting by
arm the u (1)r eld which couples canonically to the current r of the previous section,
we thus identify m =  1

in the last section we determine  by carefully normalizing the various elds, en-

abling us to compare the expressions for the anomalies which we obtained from the four-

dimensional eld theory (2.8) and the dual string theory (3.13).

4. fixing the normalizations

we start by verifying that the relative coecients of the background gauge and grav-

itational contributions to the chiral anomaly coincide in the two computations. since the

numerical relative coecients are the same, this reduces to showing that the generators

in the fundamental of so(8) which appear in (2.8) and (3.13) are normalized in the same

way. to this end we rst compute the two-point function of the so(8) avor current in
the eld theory, which is

the same.

after having shown the agreement of the relative normalization of the eld theory
and the string theory results, we will now turn to verify that the overall normalization

also agrees. to this end we must properly normalize the u (1)r gauge eld in the low-
energy ve-dimensional action. the quadratic action for the massless gauge elds has been

computed in [31], with the result

gsg is dened to be the u (1) gauge coupling constant of the d = 5 low-energy theory, a is
the massless vector eld dened above, and ar is the rescaled gauge eld which couples to
r. in the units used here, the overall prefactor comes from the term 1
22 in front of the
d = 5 supergravity action. to determine gsg we will follow once more the procedure of [13].
this means that we compute the two-point function hrri in the four-dimensional eld
theory, which is proportional to the central charge in the r(x)r(0) operator product.
we nd, to leading order in 1/n ,

hr(x)r(0)i = 

8n 2

this can either be extracted from [33] or computed directly. this one-loop result is exact,

due to the superconformal symmetry. comparison with the ads computation (using again
the results of [13]) gives gsg = /n . using (4.8) and the denition of  this leads to
 = 1/2. plugging this into (3.13) we nd exact agreement between (2.8) and (3.13),
verifying the ads/cft correspondence to this order.
