the type-iib string theory has the sl(2; z) duality [1]. various branes entering in
the theory belong to sl(2; z) multiplets. among various type-iib branes d3-brane is
something special. it is an sl(2; z) singlet and carries the charge of the background
4-form with self-dual eld strength. furthermore it may also play a fundamental role in
f theory. f theory is a conjectural theory in 12 dimensions, which explains the sl(2; z)
duality from a geometric viewpoint [2]. an idea that f theory is a theory of 3-brane
propagating in 12 dimensional spacetime has been proposed [3, 4, 5]. if such an idea is
valid, the theory of d3-brane with a manifest sl(2; z)-covariance may be a crucial step
toward the construction of the theory of f3-brane.

sl(2; z)-covariant type-iib p-branes have been considered by various authors [6, 7,
8, 9, 10].
in the cases of p > 1, an important problem is the number of degrees of
freedom. d-branes collective coordinates include, in addition to the embedding elds
into the target space, a vector eld propagating in the worldvolume. to construct an
sl(2; z)-covariant theory one needs to introduce sl(2; z) doublet worldvolume vector
elds, but as a consequence of this procedure one ends up with too many physical degrees
of freedom. to resolve this problem, these 2 vector elds must not be independent;
they should be related to each other under the electro-magnetic duality. one of the
methods which realize the electro-magnetic duality is the so-called pst formalism [11,
12, 13]. starting from the bosonic sector of the pst type m5-brane action [14, 15],
nurmagambetov constructed an sl(2; z)-covariant d3-brane action [9]. 1

nurmagambetovs model, however, includes only bosonic variables. one of the most
important properties of d-branes is that they are bps-saturated objects, that is, they
keep a half of the target space supersymmetries. so one hopes to extend this model
to supersymmetric branes. in general, the theory of a supersymmetric extended object
must have a local fermionic symmetry known as -symmetry [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,
25, 26, 27, 28, 15, 29], which halves the number of the fermionic degrees of freedom
and equates it with that of the bosonic ones. the purpose of this letter is to prove
the -symmetry of the supersymmetric version of nurmagambetovs sl(2; z)-covariant
d3-brane action.

to start with, we review the sl(2; z)-covariant d3-brane action, proposed in [9]. its
dynamical variables are the embedding elds xm and the sl(2; z) doublet vector elds
ai,r (r = 1, 2), the eld strength of which is dened as fij,r = iaj,r  jai,r. the action
is composed of 3 parts
(1)

s = sdbi + sp st + sw z.

the rst part is a dirac-born-infeld term

sdbi = z d4  gf , f = s1 + hi,r(t m)rs h i

1also in [16, 17], the relation between the d3-brane action and the m5-brane one is investigated with

respect to the sl(2; z) duality.

where hij,r is the improved eld strength hij,r = fij,r  cij,r (cij,r is the background
2-form) and vi is dened in terms of the worldvolume scalar a as

vi =

ia

q(a)2

.

notice that vi hi,r = 0 and (v)2 = 1. m is written in terms of the background scalars,
dilaton  and axion 

m =

the second part is a pasti-sorokin-tonin term

this action has the following local symmetries;

the symmetry (9) was used to reduce the equation of motion for ai,r to the non-linear
,r = 0 [11, 12, 13, 9], which is necessary for keeping the number of
duality equation gi
the physical degrees of freedom of the d3-brane to be 8.

now, we rewrite the action in a manifestly sl(2; z)-covariant manner. to this end
we introduce the complex sl(2; z) doublet background scalars ur [30, 31, 32], which
satisfy an sl(2; z)-invariant constraint

the physical background scalars,  and , belong to the coset space sl(2; r)/u(1)

using us, one can dene various sl(2; z) invariants;
from us only one obtains

in terms of these sl(2; z) invariants, the action is expressed as

fixing the u(1) symmetry by a condition im(u2) = 0, one obtains (2,6,7).

the supersymmetric action is identical to the bosonic one, but with the target space
replaced by the type-iib superspace with coordinates zm = (xm, ,  ), where  is a
10 dimensional weyl spinor and   is the complex conjugate of it. like other super-
symmetric branes, this action must have the -symmetry. in the rest, we will prove this
symmetry.

the variation of a background form  is given by its lie derivative

using this formula, one obtains q, p , c (4), c(2) and ea, from which one can read

one should take , rather than z, as the transformation parameter. the transformation
of ai,r should be specied in such a way that hij,r is -covariant, that is, contains no
derivatives of . so one takes a(1)

hij = i hij(izp )  ej

r = izc (2)

, and then obtains
b(izr(3))bc + ihij(izq).

(26)

in what follows we set a = 0.

to proceed to the calculation of the  variation, we need the knowledge of the com-
ponents of the background elds. they are given by the supergravity constraint, which
is equivalent to the equation of motion of the supergravity. we use the constraint given
in [8] 2
(dimension 0 components)

the components of dimension 1 and above do not appear in the  variation. those
relevant to the  variation which is not contained in (27,28) vanish. a is the 10 di-
mensional  matrix, and we use the real representation so that we do not distinguish 
aa. we also dene
from  in the r.h.s. of (27,28). in the following, we use i = ei
(4) = 0123 and so ((4))2 = g. we should note that the complex conjugation of the
product of fermionic quantities is dened without a reverse of the order.

using the above constraint, we proceed to the calculation of the  variation

i.e., a half of fermions are not physical.
in this article, we proved the -symmetry of the sl(2; z)-covariant super d3-brane
action. like other supersymmetric brane cases, the background supergravity constraint
turned out to be a sucient condition for the -symmetry. though we have not shown
that this is also a necessary one, this model has passed a non-trivial test of the consistency
with the type-iib supergravity 3 .

topics concerning the supersymmetry have been a major point of interest in the
in a future work, the supersymmetry algebra [35, 36, 37, 38], bps

d-brane physics.
saturated worldvolume solitons [39, 40, 41, 42] etc. need to be also investigated.

to explain the origin of the sl(2; z) duality of the type-iib theory has been a main
motivation of f theory. in this respect it may be interesting to examine whether the
theory of sl(2; z)-covariant super d3-brane may have a 12 dimensional interpretation.
