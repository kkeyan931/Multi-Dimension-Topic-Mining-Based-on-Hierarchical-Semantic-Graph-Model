abstract a dimensionally continued background-eld method makes the rationality of
the 4-loop quenched qed beta function far more reasonable than had previously ap-
peared. after 33 years of quest, dating from rosners discovery of 3-loop rationality,
one nally sees cancellation of zeta values by the trace structure of individual diagrams.
at 4-loops, diagram-by-diagram cancellation of (5) does not even rely on the values of
integrals at d = 4. rather, it is a property of the rational functions of d that multiply
elements of the full d-dimensional basis. we prove a lemma: the basis consists of slices of
wheels. we explain the previously mysterious suppression of 4 in massless gauge theory.
the 4-loop qed result 4 = 46 is obtained by setting d = 4 in a precisely dened
rational polynomial of d, with degree 11. the other 5 rational functions vanish at d = 4.

1.

introduction

connes and kreimer [1] have recently shown that dimensional regularization of feynman
diagrams is underwritten by the uniqueness of the solution of hilberts 21st problem [2].
here, we celebrate this welcome legitimization of current practice in perturbative quantum
eld theory, by nding a rational function of the spacetime dimension d that yields, at
d = 4, the 4-loop term [3, 4] in the beta function of quenched qed. for the rst time,
suppression of zeta values is seen diagram by diagram. we prove the suppression of 4 in
the ms-renormalized 3-loop single-scale green functions of any massless gauge theory.

there are 6 methods of calculating the 3-loop term [5] 3 = 2 in the beta function

(a) :=

d log a

d log 2 = xn>0

nan = 4

3 a + 4a2  2a3  46a4 + o(a5)

(1)

of quenched qed, with a coupling a := /4. as described in [6], they are as follows.

integration by parts of massive bubble diagrams [9, 10].
integration by parts of massless two-point diagrams [11].
infrared rearrangement of massless bubble diagrams [3, 12, 13, 14].

m1: dyson-schwinger skeleton expansion [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
m2:
m3:
m4:
m5: propagation in a background eld [15, 16, 17].
m6: crewther connection to deep-inelastic processes [18].

for the 4-loop term, one does not know how to use m3 directly: there is as yet no
algorithm for 4-loop 2-point functions. the historical progression through other methods
was as follows. method m4 rst gave 4 = 46 in [3]. then it was noted in [18] that
the result was consistent with deep-inelastic results [19] by virtue of the exactness of the
crewther [20] connection m6 in the quenched abelian case. progress with 4-loop massive
bubbles in m2 led to the 4-loop beta function of a general [10] gauge theory, conrming
the particular case of qed. recently [4] we used the dyson-schwinger method m1, which
was shown to be very ecient. however, in none of these 4 analyses does one gain an
understanding of how the rationality of 4 = 46 comes about; all 4 involve intricate
cancellations of zeta values between diagrams with quite dierent momentum ows.

the attentive reader will have noticed that one stone lay unturned: the background-
eld method m5. very recently we attempted it, and found it to be wonderfully user-
friendly: 8 lines of code suce. this is because it gives 4 directly in terms of 8 three-loop
diagrams, whereas in [3, 4] a reduction to 3 loops was achieved indirectly, via nullication
of four-loop diagrams, which are much more numerous. moreover, we nd that in a
background eld the cancellation of zeta values is much less obscure.

our method follows immediately from the telling observation [21] that d((a)/a)/da =

massless quenched qed, in a background eld. consider the momentum-space correlator

pn>1(n  1)nan2 is given by the radiative corrections to the photon self-energy of
iz dx eik x h0|t (j(x)j(0))|0i = (kk  k2g)n0(k2) + 2(k2)f 2 + o(f 4)o

of the electromagnetic current j :=  in a background electromagnetic eld f,
with f 2 := hff i. after struggling [4] to decode the rationality of 4 via the 4-loop
contribution to 0, i judged it more prudent to tackle the nite 3-loop contribution in

2(k2) =

2a

6k4 (1 +  23

2 ! a +  34

2 ! a2 + o(a3))

(3)

2. three-loop beta function

first we dimensionally continue rosners result, 23/2 = 1. consider the o(f 2) term
of (2) in d := 4  2 dimensions, with a dimensionless coupling a := (4)g(k2)a, where

g(k2) :=

(1 + )2(1  )

k2(1  2)

(4)

absorbs the  functions and momentum dependence of one-loop integration. let the
d-dimensional form of (3) be written as

2(k2) =

 2a

2(d  1)k4 (1 + 2 3

 2 ! a +  3 4

 2 ! a2 + o(a3))

with bars denoting analytic continuation in d. then the one-loop self-energy yields

 2 =

(6  d)(d  2)

d

tr(1)

(5)

(6)

where tr(1) is whatever one chooses to take for the trace of the unit matrix in the cliord
algebra of d dimensions. at d = 4, where certainly tr(1) = 4, we get 2 = 4.

now consider the d-dimensional analysis for  3. integration by parts [11] gives the

rst radiative correction in (5) in terms of  functions:

2 3
 2

= r2,0 + r2,3 3

where r2,0 and r2,3 are rational functions of d and

 3 :=

(d  3)k4

6(g(k2)d/2)2 z

dp1dp2dp3 (k  p1)

p 2

1 p 2

2 p 2

3 (p1  p2)2(p2  p3)2(p3  p1)2

(7)

(8)

is a slice, via a  function, of the wheel with three spokes: the tetrahedron. it is a template
for our later construction of a 3-loop basis. at 2 loops, one easily [11] evaluates

 3 =

1

63 1 

sec()(1  2)

(1 + )(1  3)! = (3) + 3

2(4) + 7(5)2 + o(3)

(9)

2

which is the sole origin of (3) :=pn>0 1/n3 in 2-loop 2-point functions at d = 4. exact

d-dimensional analysis gives the rational functions

r2,0 = 4

d6  37d5 + 554d4  4280d3 + 17826d2  37728d + 31608

(d  1)(d  3)2(d  6)3(d  8)

r2,3 = 6

(d  2)(d  4)(d  5)(d4  25d3 + 230d2  920d + 1376)

(d  1)(d  6)3(d  8)

(10)

(11)

this massless abelian analysis is far simpler than our massive non-abelian work [17, 22].
the rationality of 3 = 2 is seen in the vanishing of (11) at d = 4; the precise value
comes from setting d = 4 in (10), which gives 23/2 = 1. before proceeding to 4, we
prove a lemma, which lies at the heart of the method and has wider import.

3. suppression of 4 in massless 3-loop gauge theory

it is well understood [23] why (3) is the rst irrational number to appear in single-scale
processes, renormalized in the ms scheme. the suppression of a single power of 2 is
a property of any massless lorentz-covariant theory: every bare 2-loop 2-point diagram,
with spacelike momentum k, gives a result of the form (r2,0 + r2,3 3)a2, where r2,0 may
have 1/2 and 1/ singularities, while r2,3 is regular at d = 4. in heavy-quark eective
theory, where the worldline of the heavy quark breaks lorentz symmetry, one nds 2-loop
combinations of  functions that lack [24] the 2 suppression of (9).

it is the experience of several workers that if  and usually not until  one combines
the 3-loop diagrams specied by a massless gauge theory, 4 vanishes as well [14, 18,
19, 25]. multi-loop colleagues have asked me why this happens. the answer lies in the
output format of the program slicer [25], which gives the results of subsequent sections.
following the example of (8), we dene 4 three-loop integrals that depend only on d:

 5,s :=

(d  3)k4

20(g(k2)d/2)3 z

dp1dp2dp3dp4 (k  ps)

p 2

1 p 2

4 (p1  p2)2(p2  p3)2(p3  p4)2(p4  p1)2

2 p 2

3 p 2

(12)

with 4 distinct slices of the 4-spoke wheel, encoded by s = l, m, n, q, corresponding to
pl := p1  p3, pm := p1, pn := p1  p2 + p3  p4, pq := p1  p2, for the external
momentum, k. then each integral evaluates to (5) at d = 4, since it comes from slicing
the wheel with 4 spokes and we have proved [26] that the wheel with n + 1 spokes gives

(cid:16)2n
n(cid:17)(2n  1), for n > 1. the coding was suggested by letters in [11]: the l (ladder) slice

is at the 4-point hub, in the s-channel; m (mercedes-benz) is at the rim; n (non-planar)
is at the hub, in the u-channel; q (?) is at a spoke. remarkably, this completes a basis.

lemma: a bare 3-loop 2-point diagram with external momentum k gives

r3,0 + r3,3 3 + xs=l,m,n,q



r3,s 5,s

3

with coecients {r3,s | s = 0, 3, l, m, n, q} that are rational functions of d.

a3

(13)

proof: this is an extension of the ne analysis of chetyrkin and tkachov [11]. consider
the 5 one-particle-irreducible 4-loop bubble diagrams of fig. 1. generate all tadpole-free
trivalent 3-loop 2-point diagrams by slicing these, to obtain the 12 distinct cases of fig 2,
where each slice is marked. whatever the numerators, and whatever the integer powers
of the propagators, integration by parts [11] allows one to eliminate all and only those
diagrams that contain at least one unsliced triangle. thus we may eliminate 5 of the
12 cases, namely c2, c3, c4, d1, d2. the nal observation is that b3, the sole case
with a sliced chord in fig. 2, is rationally related to b2. the basic one-loop integral in d
dimensions is [23]

g(a, b) :=

(a + b  d/2)

(d/2  a)(d/2  b)

(a)(b)

(d  a  b)

(14)

with propagators raised to powers a and b. let (x) be the representative of class x in
d-dimensional 3 theory. using only (z + 1) = z(z), we obtain

(b3)
(b2)

=

g(1, 1)g(1 + , 1 + )
g(1, 1 + )g(1, 1 + 2)

=

3d  10
d  3

(15)

then (13) is a basis for the 6 remaining cases, since (8,12) are independent. 2.

two comments are in order. first, the factor d3 in (12) ensures that the  expansions
of  5,s are all pure: at order n one encounters multiple [27] zeta values, exclusively of
weight n + 5. all mixing derives from the rational coecients, of which only r3,0 and
r3,3 may be singular at d = 4. secondly, there are two [11] combinations of { 5,s | s =
l, m, q} that may be reduced to  functions. no purpose is served by making such
reductions: one would need 5th order taylor series for those  functions to arrive back
at a result for d = 4 that is immediately available from (13). moreover, such reduction
would obscure our physical conclusion.

corollary:
green functions do not involve 4.

in massless gauge theory, ms-renormalized 3-loop single-scale

proof: the lemma shows that (4) = 4/90 may arise only from (9). this would occur
only if r3,3 is singular. but such a singularity, in the sum of diagrams, would require a
counterterm (3)/ in the coupling. it is proven that the 3-loop  function of any gauge
theory is rational [28], hence no such counterterm is available. 2

now one sees why cancellations of 4 were regarded as surprising in computations
such as [14, 19]. the bare (4) terms generated by mincer [29] appeared to have several
sources: taylor expansions of  functions from diagrams in classes a1, a2, b1, b2, b3. by
contrast, slicer [25] outputs the 6 exact d-dimensional rational functions of the lemma.
in our approach, one is bound to nd that r3,3 is regular in the sum of diagrams of a
massless gauge theory; slicer encodes the suppression of 4, ab initio.

note, however, that the 3-loop anomalous mass dimension [30] involves (3). thus if
one expands in the fermion mass, 4 may emerge. indeed, one nds (4) in non-abelian

4

terms of the 4-loop anomalous mass dimension [31, 32]. its absence from the 4-loop beta
function is guaranteed by the lemma and serves as a check of the full result [10].

4. four-loop beta function

for 4, we need the nite 3-loop term in (3). instead of the 7  5  3 = 105 four-loop
diagrams of [3], there are only 5  3 = 15 three-loop diagrams. these are reduced to 8, by
symmetries. each contains a single fermion loop: a hamiltonian circuit with 6 vertices.
consider a bare fermion propagator, with momentum p. without a background eld, it
would simply be s(p) = i/p/. to take account of the abelian background eld, f, one
replaces this by

s(p + id) = s(p)  s(p)d/ s(p) + s(p)d/ s(p)d/ s(p) + o(d3)

(16)

where d is an operator in a fock-feynman-schwinger formalism [15] that is oblivious to
the momentum integrations, feeling only the order of  matrices. all one needs to know
is that [d, d] = ief , since d acts as a gauge-covariant derivative in the external
conguration space. for a modern review of the non-abelian case, see [33]. here, we need
only obtain the coecient of f 2 := hff i, using

hddddi = (gg  gg)

e2f 2

2d(d  1)

(17)

for the expectation value of 4 external derivations. this is contracted with all ways
of making 4 ordered insertions of gamma matrices in the 6 fermion propagators on a
hamiltonian circuit that begins and ends at an external vertex of the 3-loop feynman
diagram. the tensor in (17) implies that the second-order expansion (16) suces for any
single propagator: insertion of more than 2 gamma matrices in any one propagator leads
to a vanishing contraction. thus no infrared divergence is produced. simple counting
shows that each diagram produces 180 traces, containing 20 gamma matrices.

this astoundingly user-friendly method is cpu-intensive.

in the dyson-schwinger
method [4], it was possible to take traces before double dierentiation w.r.t. an external
photon momentum, thus limiting the traces to 16 gamma matrices. moreover, for the most
demanding integrals one needed only traces taken at d = 4. now, the exact handling
of two non-commutative algebras  diracs gamma matrices and schwingers covariant
derivatives  requires more machine time, while the physicist relaxes. within hours of
reading [1], i had typed 8 lines into slicer, one for each of the 8 diagrams, added a short
procedure to generate the 8  180 = 1440 traces, and farmed the problem out, using a
cluster of decalpha machines. since slicer, using reduce, is wildly uncompetitive with
jos vermaserens lightning-fast implementation of mincer in form, it was 2 days later
when the answer 46 appeared on screen. however, the object was not speed. rather
it was a better understanding of cancellation of zeta values, which was mysterious in the
faster dyson-schwinger method [4].

5. fock-feynman-schwinger anatomy

the dyson-schwinger anatomy of 3 exhibits cancellation of (3) between diagrams
in landau gauge [5], in feynman gauge [4, 21], and indeed in any gauge [6].
in the
background-eld method, 3 comes from two 2-loop diagrams, each of which is free of
(3), as d  4, in any combination of internal and external gauges. we used a gauge
(q2g + (int  1)qq)/q4, for the internal photon propagator, and contracted (2) with
k2g + (ext  1)kk, where k is the external photon momentum. as   0, we found

c3(pe) =  1

c3(df) =  1

23/2 = 1

2 + int(cid:18)2
2  int(cid:18)2





+ 1(cid:19)  ext(cid:18)1
+ 1(cid:19) + ext(cid:18)1





+ 2(cid:19)  intext
+ 2(cid:19) + intext

(18)

(19)

(20)

where pe and df identify the photon-exchange and dressed-fermion contributions. there
is no sign of (3) in either diagram.

this was no accident, as witnessed by the 4-loop result, obtained in feynman gauge,

for the sake of economy. as   0, the contributions and total for 34/2 are

with diagrams identied by fig. 2. there is no sign of (5) in any diagram. this, again,
is radically dierent from the dyson-schwinger method.

even more impressive is the distribution of (5) between the 4 distinct slices in (12).
by construction, slicer is oblivious to the contingency that these integrals happen to
be equal at d = 4. thus it records that each is cancelled separately, in each diagram, by

6

the dirac-schwinger traces that produce 4 exact rational functions of d, each vanishing
at d = 4. thus, in the background-eld method, the absence of (5) relies neither
on conspiracies between dierent diagrams nor on any happenstance of 4-dimensional
analysis. this is a reasonable type of rationality, that one may realistically hope to
understand better, by essentially combinatoric methods.

it will be noted that the subleading zeta value, (3), is seen in results (2428), for
individual diagrams that are slices of the c, d, e topologies of fig. 1. however, it
should also be noted that this subleading irrational occurs only at subleading order in .
topologies c and d produce (3)/ singularities, at the level of individual dirac-schwinger
traces. these conspicuously cancel, diagram by diagram. thus background-eld trace
algebra accounts for 6 of the 7 features of rationality up to 4 loops: the cancellation of
(3) at 3 loops; of all 4 species of (5), separately, at 4-loops; of (3)/ at 4 loops. only
the nal cancellation  subleading irrational, subleading in   entails conspiracy between
feynman-gauge diagrams. a mincer analysis for all int and ext would be fascinating.

6. exercise and conclusion

we have completed an instructive exercise in dimensional continuation of a nite quantity.

1. evaluate the exact d-dimensional 3-loop radiative correction in (5). by the lemma

of section 3, this amounts to nding 6 precisely dened rational functions of d in

3 4
 2

= r3,0 + r3,3 3 + xs=l,m,n,q

r3,s 5,s

(30)

with wheel-slice basis (8,12). forget 4; in massless gauge theory it never happens.

2. verify that {r3,s | s 6= 0} contain the factor d4. dissect this, diagram by diagram.

conclusion: rationality appears far more reasonable than in any other method.

3. find the numerator and denominator of r3,0 = n(d)/d(d). solution:

n(d) = 1215d11  53433d10 + 1072059d9  12995191d8 + 105924166d7

 609433848d6 + 2520429944d5  7469717936d4 + 15495188128d3
 21364053504d2 + 17580978560d  6532684800

d(d) = 2(d  1)(d  3)3(d  5)2(d  6)3(d  8)(3d  8)(3d  10)2

(31)
(32)

hence, in 4-loop quenched qed, 4 = n(4)/2832. check that the answer is 46.

i conclude that the key to jonathan rosners ne puzzle [5] was given by marshall
baker and kenneth johnson, in eq (3.3) of [21]. noting the profound work of alain
connes and dirk kreimer [1], one arrives at the nub of the rationality of quenched qed:
dimensional continuation of the derivative of the scheme-independent single-fermion-loop
gell-mannlow function, via the fockfeynmanschwinger formalism (16,17). it remains
to be seen whether this can tell us what comes after 4 = 46. hope has risen.
