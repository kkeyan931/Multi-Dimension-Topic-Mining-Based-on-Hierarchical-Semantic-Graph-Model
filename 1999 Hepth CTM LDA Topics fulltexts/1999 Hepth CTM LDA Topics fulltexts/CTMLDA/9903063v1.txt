we show that the solutions of su(2) yang-mills-dilation
and einstein-yang-mills-dilaton theories described in a se-
quence of papers by kleihaus and kunz are not regular in the
gauge eld part.

since the pioneering papers by bogomolnyi [1] and
witten [2] on exact solutions of classical yang-mills the-
ory many studies in this eld have been carried out. in
recent time the gravitational self-interaction of solitons
has been of interest [3]. not only spherically symmetric
solutions of theories including yang-mills elds, with or
without gravitation, higgs, or dilaton elds, have been
constructed, but also solutions with axial symmetry [4].
these latter type of solitons was studied by kleihaus
and kunz in the context of yang-mills-dilaton theory
[5] and einstein-yang-mills-dilaton theory [69], mainly
by numerical construction. the relevance of solutions
containing black holes is that they should provide coun-
terexamples to the no-hair conjecture for such theories.
this conjecture is the analog to the no-hair theorems in
einstein-maxwell and related theories [10].

in this communication we would like to point out that
the gauge eld part of the solutions described in refs.
[59] are not regular on the symmetry axis, in contradic-
tion to what is claimed. thus the solutions are similar
to singular monopole solutions and thus have to be inter-
preted carefully [1113]. we explicitly derive conditions
for the regularity, and show that a recent attempt by
kleihaus [15] to relate the non-regular solution to regu-
lar ones via a (non-regular) gauge transformations like it
is done in the case of monopoles falls short of its aim, so
that one must ask whether the solutions described exist
in any well-dened way.

non-regular gauge elds are encountered within
in general, solutions
diracs theory of monopoles.
of maxwells equations for the electromagnetic four-
potential must be twice continuous dierentiable in order
to be acceptable from the mathematical point of view.
from the aharonov-bohm eect we know that continu-
ity of
the potential is essential. for the derivation of
the eld equations from an action one uses partial in-
tegration, thus the solutions must be dierentiable. in
general, regularity means that all solutions are at least
twice dierentiable in the sense of distributions, allowing
for delta-like sources. vacuum solution will in general be
locally analytic. in diracs theory of monopoles there ex-

ists no globally dened regular gauge eld, only the elec-
tromagnetic eld tensor is regular. one can nd a gauge
transformation in the vicinity of the singularity on the
symmetry axis that gives a locally regular gauge eld,
and the compatibility condition in the overlap region
leads to the quantization of the monopole [11,12]. in the
case of non-abelian gauge theories the situation is more
complicated , and for overlapping solutions connected by
gauge transformations compatibility conditions are re-
quired [13]. another problem is that the gauge potential
explicitly enter in the eld equations for the gauge eld
tensor, because in contrast to the abelian case the gauge
eld tensor is only gauge covariant, not invariant. thus,
at singular points of the gauge potential the eld equa-
tions are not well dened, even if the eld tensor is. in
the case of spherically symmetric solutions there will in
general be only a singularity at the origin, the coordinate
singularity on the z-axis plays no role due to the spher-
ical symmetry. witten [2] explicitly showed how such a
singularity can be removed by a gauge transformation.

in the case of axially symmetric solutions the situation
becomes more complicated, since a coordinate singularity
at  = 0,  is introduced, but cannot be removed by
a symmetry argument. together with axial symmetry
rebbi and rossi [4] introduced a winding number n into
their ansatz for the gauge eld, using unit vectors in the
lie algebra su(2) of su (2) that correspond to cylindrical
coordinates (, , z). writing these as

u1 =  n
u2 =  n
u3 =  n

 = 1 cos n + 2 sin n
 = 1 sin n + 2 cos n
z = 3

(1)

where i, i = 1, 2, 3 are the pauli matrices, the gauge eld
attains the form

a = uiw i


(2)

with twelve independent gauge elds w i
, i = 1, 2, 3,  =
0, 1, 2, 3. in spherical coordinates (r, , ) the unit vector
of su(2) will be

 n
r = 1 sin  cos n + 2 sin  sin n + 3 cos ,
 n
 = 1 cos  cos n + 2 cos  sin n  3 sin ,
 n
 = 1 sin n + 2 cos n

(3)

the gauge potentials a are not regular unless the func-
tions w i
 behave appropriately on the z-axis, since the
functions sin n, cos n, when considered as functions on
s 2, are neither continuous nor dierentiable at the poles

1

 = 0, . the functions sin n and cos n can be ex-
panded into polynomials of degree |n| in the variables

sin  = y/ and cos  = x/, with  = px2 + y2; all

terms of these polynomials have denominators that are
even powers of  for n even, and odd powers of  for n
odd. hence |n| sin n and |n| cos n are regular func-
tions except for r = 0, and may further be multiplied
by functions of the variables 2 and z without loosing
their regularity. this was explicitly taken into account
by rebbi and rossi [4].
in spherical coordinates func-
tions of the type

f (cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin|n|  sin n + g(cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin|n|  cos n

(4)

with regular functions f and g are regular along the axis
 = 0, possibly except at r = 0. the well dened -
parity of these functions is easily understood. on any
great circle through the pole at  = 0, with  = 0 to
the right of the pole,  = 0 to the left, and coordinate

 = (cid:26)

 for  > 0,  = 0

 for  < 0,  = 0  

(5)

we have for any function f () (dened only for  > 0)

lim
0

k
k f ( = ) sin n (0  )
k
k f ( = ) sin n0.

= (1)n+k lim
0

(6)

therefore it is necessary that f () is an even function
in  for n even, an odd function for n odd in order that
f () sin n can be continuous (k = 0) or that the deriva-
tives exist (k = 1, 2, ...). together with the multiplication
by the factor sin|n|  we obtain (4) as a sucient form for
functions to be analytical at  = 0.

kleihaus and kunz use spherical coordinates (r, , ).

their ansatz for the su (2) gauge eld is [8]:

adx =

1

2gr (cid:26)  n

 [h1dr + (1  h2)rd]
n [ n

 (1  h4)] r sin d (cid:27)

r h3 +  n

(7)

this gauge potential is singular at x = y = 0 unless
appropriate conditions are imposed on the functions hi,
i = 1, 2, 3, 4 that depend only on r and . in order to an-
alyze this ansatz for regularity, we decompose the gauge
potential into its cartesian components,

2 = f1 cos n sin   nf3 sin n cos 
2 = nf4 cos 
3 = f2 sin n
3 = f2 cos n
3 = 0.

the functions f1 to f4 are dened by

f1 = h1 sin  + (1  h2) cos 
f2 = h1 cos   (1  h2) sin 
f3 = h3 sin  + (1  h4) cos 
f4 = h3 cos   (1  h4) sin .

(9)

(10)

we see that a sucient condition that the gauge potential
can be analytically extended to  = 0 for r > 0 is

f1 (r, ) = f1(cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin|n|+1 
f2 (r, ) = f2(cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin|n| 
f3 (r, ) = f3(cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin|n|+1 
f4 (r, ) = f4(cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin 

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

with analytic functions f1 to f4. if regularity is sought
only up to a certain number of derivatives, then accord-
ingly less constraints on the odd orders in  are needed.
now a more subtle point is that these conditions guaran-
tee regularity, but are not necessary. in the special case
n = 1 with spherical symmetry and h1 = h3 = 0, h2 =
h4 = w(r) we see that f1 and f3 do not respect (11) and
(13), respectively. the reason is that in the case f1 = f3
the relation cos2  + sin2  = 1 leads to a regular func-
tion where in general f1 cos2 + f3 sin2  would not have
been regular. it is not dicult to see that for arbitrary
n this will happen if

f1 = nf3

(15)

so that we can do with two powers less of sin  in (11) and
(13) if the functions agree in the lowest order. hence an
ansatz that is analytical and also respects all symmetry
requirements at  = 0, /2,  is given by

f1 (r, ) = hnf (r) + f1(cid:0)r, sin2 (cid:1) sin2 i cos  sin|n|1  (16)
f2 (r, ) = f2(cid:0)r, sin2 (cid:1) sin|n| 
f3 (r, ) = hf (r) + f3(cid:0)r, sin2 (cid:1) sin2 i cos  sin|n|1 
f4 (r, ) = f4(cid:0)r, sin2 (cid:1) sin 

(18)

(17)

(19)

for the function hi this implies

h1 = f1 sin  + f2 cos 

= hnf (r)  f1 sin2  + f2i cos  sin|n| 

(1  h2) = f1 cos  + f2 sin 

h3 = f3 sin  + f4 cos 

= h(cid:16)nf (r) + f1 sin2 (cid:17) cos2  + f2 sin2 i sin|n|1 
= h(cid:16)f (r)  f3 sin2 (cid:17) sin|n|1  + f4i sin  cos 

(1  h4) = f3 cos  + f4 sin 

= hf (r) + f3 sin2 i cos2  sin|n|1  + f4 sin2 . (20)

exist at all. a proof of existence is certainly needed, espe-
cially since more boundary conditions must be satised
than can be given to the numerical routines for solving
the nonlinear partial dierential equations for these func-
tions. therefore, at least so far as the su (2) einstein-
yang-mills(-dilaton) theory has been studied by kleihaus
and kunz, the numerical solutions give insucient indi-
cation for the existence of corresponding exact solutions.
finally, a remark about the interpretation of the the-
ory appears to be indicated. provided the existence of
regular solutions has been established, their discussion
should not be based on gauge-dependent properties of
some singular potential. we have seen that the func-
tion f , which is the only relevant one in the spherically
symmetric case, has no physical meaning in the axially
symmetric case [16]. for n > 1 the functions h2 and
h4 must satisfy h2 = h4 = 1 on the symmetry axis for
any regular gauge potential, which means that the node
number of these functions introduced in the discussion
are artifacts of the singular gauge. hence the classi-
cation of solutions that are not equivalent under gauge
transformations must be based on some other aspect.

this especially implies that h1 and 1  h2 will always
have a well dened -parity, whereas for h3 and 1  h4
this is the case only for odd n. at the point r = 0 the
gauge potential is analytical, if moreover the functions
fi have the from

fi(cid:0)r, sin2 (cid:1) = r2 fi(cid:0)r2, sin2 (cid:1) for i = 1, 3
fi(cid:0)r, sin2 (cid:1) = r fi(cid:0)r2, sin2 (cid:1) for i = 2, 4

(21)

with analytical functions fi. the solutions constructed
by kleihaus and kunz [59] do not have the regular form
(20) [14].

kleihaus most recently showed [15] that for n = 2, 3, 4

a gauge transformation of the form

u (~r) = exp(i

leads to a new gauge eld

a = u au  + idu u

(24)

we see that this transformation resulted in a continuous
gauge potential [16], but since the conditions on the -
parity have not been considered, the potentials are still
possibly not dierentiable at  = 0. one must at least
show that the next to leading order vanishes, then the
potentials will be twice dierentiable at least. especially
for even n the -parity of the functions h1 and h2, which
is necessary in view of (10) and (16) and (17), is not re-
spected in the expansions given. thus the desired aim,
namely to show that one can obtain all gauge invariant
quantities also from a regular gauge potential, that exists
at least locally, has been failed. moreover, where expan-
sions of the gauge potential functions hi have been car-
ried without respecting the necessary -parity, we must
indeed ask whether regular solutions with axial symmetry
