abstract

we obtain the non-perturbative eective potential for the dual ve-dimen-
sional n = 4 strings in the context of nite-temperature regarded as a
breaking of supersymmetry into four space-time dimensions. using the
properties of gauged n = 4 supergravity we derive the universal thermal
eective potential describing all possible high-temperature instabilities of
the known n = 4 superstrings. these strings undergo a high-temperature
transition to a new phase in which ve-branes condense. this phase is
described in detail, using both the eective supergravity and non-critical
string theory in six dimensions. in the new phase, supersymmetry is per-
turbatively restored but broken at the non-perturbative level.

1 introduction

a convenient way to analyse a d-dimensional theory at nite temperature is to iden-
tify the temperature with the inverse radius of a compactied euclidean time on s1,
r = 1/2t and to modify the boundary conditions around the s1 according to spin-

statistics: periodic for bosons, antiperiodic for fermions. the modied boundary con-
ditions shift the s1 kaluza-klein charge by an amount proportional to the helicity of
the state, m  m+q. in string theories this shift is generalised and includes a winding
contribution: m  m + q + n/2. this shift is dictated by the world-sheet modular
invariance;  = 1 for the heterotic string and  = 0 for the type ii strings [1, 2, 3].

furthermore, the gso projection in the odd winding number sector is reversed.

for an even winding number n, the thermal modication can be regarded as a shift

of m and q compatible with the (supersymmetric) gso projection. as a consequence,

the spectrum in even n sectors is not dierent in the thermal and supersymmetric

cases, the mass formula for the (lightest) bps fermions, gauge bosons and scalars with
even windings n remains m2 = p 2, with m modied, and tachyonic states are not
present. the situation is not the same for states with odd winding number n due to

the reversion of the gso projection. it follows that the only states that can become
tachyonic are those with n = 1 and correspond to (d1)-dimensional scalars coming
from the longitudinal components of the d-dimensional metric.

tachyons cannot appear in a perturbative supersymmetric eld theory, which be-

haves like the zero-winding sector of strings; all (squared) masses are increased by nite
temperature corrections, m2 = p 2, and a thermal instability is never generated by a
state becoming tachyonic at high temperature. however, as we will see below, in non-

perturbative supersymmetric eld theories such an instability can arise from thermal

dyonic modes, which behave as the odd winding string states [4]. indeed, in theories

with n = 4 supersymmetries, the bps mass formula is determined by the central

extension of the corresponding superalgebra [5][7] and dyonic eld theory states are

mapped to string winding modes [8, 7]. using heterotictype ii duality, one can argue

that the thermal shift of the bps masses modies only the perturbative momentum

charge m.

in both heterotic and type ii perturbative strings, the thermal winding

number n is not aected by the temperature shifts. since, in dimensions lower than

six, heterotictype ii duality exchanges the winding numbers n of the two theories,

1

and since the winding number of the one theory is the magnetic charge of the other,

it is inferred that eld theory magnetic numbers are not shifted at nite temperature.

this in turn indicates how to modify the bps mass formula at nite temperature [4].

it turns out that string theories with d-dimensional space-time supersymmetry
look at nite temperature as if supersymmetry were spontaneously broken in d  1
dimensions [1][4].

2 thermal masses and string-string dualities

the non-perturbative four-dimensional thermal mass formula has been obtained in ref.

[4]. the procedure is to start with the n = 4 four-dimensional bps mass formula on

a circle with radius r, which depends on an eective string tension

the modied nite-temperature formula reads then

t =  m + q + kp

2 tp,q,r |k|,1 q,0 ,

(2.2)

in these expressions, kp is the winding number in the heterotic string representation
with intercept scale h , while kq is the magnetic kaluza-klein charge and kr is the
magnetic winding charge. still in the heterotic picture, kq is the wrapping number of
the heterotic ve-brane around t 4  s1
r, while kr corresponds to the same wrapping
number after performing a t-duality along the circle of the sixth dimension. the shift

in the momentum kaluza-klein number m

m  m + q +

,

is dictated by the change of boundary conditions at nite temperature, compared to a
simple circle compactication. the helicity charge q distinguishes (four-dimensional)

bosons and fermions. the shift kp/2 is dictated then by modular invariance of the

dual perturbative strings. finally, the mass formula (2.2) includes a subtraction in the

odd k winding sector of the eective tp,q,r string. we refer to ref.

[4] for a detailed

discussion.

2

the mass formula (2.2) depends on three parameters: the six-dimensional heterotic

string coupling h, the circle compactication r6 from six to ve dimensions, and

the radius r which will be identied with the inverse temperature. it also depends

on a scale: the duality invariant scale is the (four-dimensional) planck scale  =
8m1
p = (2.4  1018 gev)1. it is convenient to introduce instead of h, r6 and r
the (dimensionless) variables

t =

rr6
h

,

u =

r
r6

,

s = g2

h =

t
2
h

,

(2.3)

which will be directly related to moduli of the eective supergravity theory; gh is now
the four-dimensional heterotic string coupling. the various  scales in the eective

tension (2.1) are

h = 22s, iia = 22t, iib = 22u,

(2.4)

when expressed in planck units.

in addition, stringstring dualities have a simple

formulation using these variables. before the temperature shift on m, the bps mass
formula is invariant under the exchanges s  t, s  u and t  u. these operations
correspond respectively to heteroticiia, heteroticiib and iiaiib dualities in the

undeformed (by temperature) n = 4 supersymmetric theories. in terms of s, t and u,

the temperature radius r is given by

r2 = h tu = 22stu

(2.5)

and r is by construction identical in all three string theories.

as a consequence of the bps conditions and the s  t  u duality symmetry in the
undeformed supersymmetric theory, the integers p, q, r are non-negative and relatively
prime. furthermore, mk  1 because of the inversion of the gso projection in the
theory deformed by temperature. using these constraints, it is straightforward to show
that in general there are two potential tachyonic series with m = 1 and p = 1, 2:

r =  2  1

(2.6)

p = 2,

(p, q, r) relat. primes :

one of the perturbative heterotic, type iia or type iib potential tachyons corresponds

3

to a critical temperature that is always lower than the above two series. the pertur-

bative hagedorn temperatures are:

heterotic tachyon : m = 1, kp = 1, q = 0

and t = (2r)1.

2t =

q2iib

this discussion shows that the temperature modication of the mass formula in-

ferred from perturbative strings and applied to the non-perturbative bps mass formula

produces the appropriate instabilities in terms of hagedorn temperature. we will now

proceed to show that it is possible to go beyond the simple enumeration of hage-

dorn temperatures. we will construct an eective supergravity lagrangian that allows

a study of the nature of the non-perturbative instabilities and the dynamics of the

various thermal phases.

the above formula hold for supersymmetry broken by temperature eects in eu-

clidean space. they would similarly hold for a non-supersymmetric four-dimensional

minkowski theory in which supersymmetry would be broken by a particular scherk-

schwarz compactication of the fth dimension.

3 eective supergravity in n=1 representation

in the previous section, we have studied the appearance of tachyonic states generating

thermal instabilities at the level of the mass formula for n = 4 bps states. to

obtain information on dynamical aspects of these instabilities, we now construct the

full temperature-dependent eective potential for the would-be tachyonic states.

our procedure to construct the eective theory is as follows. we consider ve-

dimensional n = 4 theories at nite temperature. they can then eectively be de-

scribed by four-dimensional theories, in which supersymmetry is spontaneously broken

4

by thermal eects. since we want to limit ourselves to the description of instabilities,

it is sucient to only retain, in the full n = 4 spectrum, the potentially massless and

tachyonic states. this restriction will lead us to consider only spin 0 and 1/2 states, the
graviton and the gravitino1. this sub-spectrum is described by an n = 1 supergravity

with chiral multiplets.

the scalar manifold of a generic, unbroken, n = 4 theory is [9][12]

u(1) !s  g/h,

 sl(2, r)
g/h =  

so(6, r + n)

so(6)  so(r + n)!ti ,a

.

(3.7)

the manifold g/h of the n = 4 vector multiplets naturally splits into a part that
includes the 6r moduli ti, and a second part which includes the innite number n  
of bps states a.

in the manifold g/h, we are only interested in keeping the six bps states za ,
a = 1, 2, 3, which, according to our discussion in the previous section, generate thermal

instabilities in heterotic, iia and iib strings. for consistency, these states must be

supplemented by two moduli t and u among the tis. we consider heterotic and type
ii strings respectively on t 4  s1
and s1

truncation of the scalar manifold g/h, which only retains the desired states of n = 1
chiral multiplets, we use a z2  z2 subgroup contained in the so(6) r-symmetry of
the coset g/h. this symmetry can be used as the point group of an n = 1 orbifold

compactication, but we will only use it for projecting out non-invariant states of the
n = 4 theory2 with r + n = 8.

the z2  z2 projection splits h = so(6)  so(8) in so(2)3  so(2)  so(3)2

tential is

k =  log[(s + s)(t + t )(u + u)]

2 log[1  2zaza + (zaza)(zbzb)].

the superpotential of the theory is obtained using the fact that at the level of n = 4

supergravity, nite temperature corresponds to a particular scherk-schwarz gauging,

breaking supersymmetry spontaneously. this gauging is dened by a set of generalized

(eld-dependent) structure constants, involving the compensating multiplets which are

used to dene the g/h manifold. the truncation to n = 1 supergravity delivers then

the following expression for the superpotential:

w = 2[(1  zaza)(1  zbzb) + 2(t u  1)z 2

1 + 2suz 2

2 + 2st z 2

(3.11)

from the kahler potential and the superpotential we can then compute the full ef-

fective scalar potential and study its instabilities. its complicated expression simplies

drastically in the directions relevant to instabilities. introducing the variables

3.1 phase structure of the thermal eective theory

the scalar potential (3.13) derived from our eective supergravity possesses four dif-

ferent phases corresponding to specic regions of the s, t and u moduli space. their

boundaries are dened by critical values of the moduli s, t, and u (or of i, i = 1, 2, 3),

or equivalently by critical values of the temperature, the (four-dimensional) string cou-

pling and the compactication radius r6. these four phases are:

1. the low-temperature phase:

t < (2  1)1/2/(4);

2. the high-temperature heterotic phase:

t > (2  1)1/2/(4), g2

h < (2 + 2)/4;

3. the high-temperature type iia phase:

t > (2  1)1/2/(4), g2

4. the high-temperature type iib phase:

t > (2  1)1/2/(4), g2

h > (2 + 2)/4 and r6 > qh ;
h > (2 + 2)/4 and r6 < qh .

the distinction between phases 3 and 4 is, however, somewhat academic, since there

is no phase boundary at r6 = qh .

3.1.1 low-temperature phase

this phase, which is common to all three strings, is characterized by

h1 = h2 = h3 = 0,

v1 = v2 = v3 = 0.

(3.14)

the potential vanishes for all values of the moduli s, t and u, which are then restricted

only by the stability of the phase, namely the absence of tachyons in the mass spectrum

of the scalars hi. this mass spectrum is analysed in ref. [4]. stability requires then:

1 > h = (2 + 1)2,

2 > 4,

3 > 4.

(3.15)

7

from the above conditions, it follows in particular that the temperature must verify

t =

2   1

123!1/4

.

<

(3.16)

since the (four-dimensional) string couplings are
t = 2g2
a ,

s = 2g2
h ,

u = 2g2
b ,

this phase exists in the perturbative regime of all three strings. the relevant light

thermal states are just the massless modes of the ve-dimensional n = 4 supergravity,
with thermal mass scaling like 1/r  t .

alternatively, if this eective theory is considered as a six-dimensional minkowski

model compactied on s1
lowest s1

r6, with spontaneously broken supersymmetry, then the
r kaluza-klein modes have masses shifted by a quantity proportional to the

r  s1

gravitino mass scale,

m2

3/2 =

1
4r2 ,

which then controls both the kaluza-klein mass shifts and the splitting of supersym-

metric multiplets.

3.1.2 high-temperature heterotic phase

this phase is dened by

h > 1 >

1
h

,

2 > 4,

3 > 4,

(3.17)

with h = (2 + 1)2, as in eq. (3.15). the inequalities on 2 and 3 eliminate type ii
instabilities. in this region of the moduli, and after minimization with respect to h1,

h2 and h3, the potential becomes

4v = 

1
s

(1 + 1
1  6)2
16(1 + 1

it has a stable minimum for xed s (for xed h) at the minimum of the self-dual3
quantity 1 + 1

1 = 1, h1 = 1

2 , h2 = h3 = 0,

4v =

(3.18)

3with respect to heterotic temperature duality.

the transition from the low-temperature vacuum is due to a condensation of the het-

erotic thermal winding mode h1, or equivalently by a condensation of type iia ns

ve-brane in the type iia picture.

at the level of the potential only, this phase exhibits a runaway behaviour in s. we

will show in the next section the existence of a stable solution to the eective action

with non-trivial metric and/or dilaton.

in heterotic language, s, t and u are particular combinations of the four-dimensional
gauge coupling gh, the temperature t = (2r)1 and the compactication radius from

six to ve dimensions r6. the relations are

the rst equation indicates that the temperature, when expressed in units of the four-

dimensional gravitational coupling constant  is invariant under stringstring dualities.

in terms of heterotic variables, the critical temperatures (3.17) separating the het-

erotic phases are

this strong-coupling regime and the value of r6/qh decides whether the type iia or

if on the other hand the heterotic string is weakly coupled,

these phases are dened by inequalities:

2 < 4

3 < 4.

in contrast with the high-temperature heterotic phase, the potential does not possess

stationary values of 2 and/or 3, besides the critical 2,3 = 4.

suppose for instance that 2 < 4 and 3 > 4. the resulting potential is then v2

only and 2 slides to zero. in this limit,

other scalar components log(t/u) and log(s/u) have only derivative couplings, since

the potential only depends on . they can be taken to be constant and arbitrary.
the dynamics only restricts the temperature radius 2r2 = e, r6 and the string
coupling are not constrained, besides inequalities (3.27).

in conformally at gravity background, the equation of motion of the scalar  is

the solution of the above and the einstein equations denes a non-trivial gravitational

-background. this solution will correspond to the high-temperature type ii vacuum.

we will not study this solution further here.

4 high-temperature heterotic phase

the thermal phase relevant to weakly-coupled, high-temperature heterotic strings at

intermediate values of the radius r6 [see inequalities (3.25) and (3.26)] has an interest-

ing interpretation; we study this here, using the information contained in its eective

theory, which is characterized by eqs. (3.18):

tu = 1,

h1 =

1
2

,

11

h2 = h3 = 0.

(4.30)

these values solve the equations of motion of all scalar elds with the exception of s.

the resulting bosonic eective lagrangian describing the dynamics of s and g is

lbos =

.

(4.31)

for all (xed) values of s, the cosmological constant is negative since e1v = (24s)1
and the apparent geometry is anti-de sitter. but the eective theory (4.30) does not

stabilize s.

to study the bosonic lagrangian, we rst rewrite it in the string frame. dening

the linear dilaton background breaks both four-dimensional lorentz symmetry and

four-dimensional poincare supersymmetry. since supersymmetry breaks spontaneous-

ly, one expects to nd goldstino states in the fermionic mass spectrum and massive

spin 3/2 states. and, because of the non-trivial background, the theory in the high-

temperature heterotic phase is eectively a three-dimensional supergravity.

to discuss the pattern of goldstino states, observe rst that the supergravity ex-

tension of the bosonic lagrangian (4.31) includes a non-zero gravitino mass term for

supersymmetries generated by (1  1) are then broken in the linear dilaton back-
ground in the x1 direction while those with parameters (1 + 1) remain unbroken.

starting then from sixteen supercharges (n = 4 supersymmetry) at zero temperature,

the high-temperature heterotic vacuum has eight unbroken supercharges. since the

eective space-time symmetry is three-dimensional, the high-temperature phase has

n3 = 4 supersymmetry: the linear dilaton background acts identically with respect to

the n = 4 spinorial charges. it simply breaks one half of the charges in each spinor.

thus, the high-temperature phase is expected to be stable because of supersymmetry

of its eective eld theory and because of its superconformal content.

the mass spectrum of the eective supergravity theory in the linear dilaton back-

ground is analyzed in ref. [4]. one rst observes that the kahler potential does not

induce any mixing between the dilaton multiplet and other chiral multiplets. then,

the dilaton multiplet only plays an active role in the breaking of supersymmetry.

this splitting of chiral multiplets does not exist in the low-temperature phase h1 =

h2 = h3 = 0, in which

gs = (2s)1,

gt = (2t)1,

as goldstino state7. the low-temperature phase is symmetric in the moduli s, t and

u: it is common to the three dual strings, in their perturbative and non-perturbative

domains.

in contrast, the high-temperature heterotic phase only exists in the per-

turbative domain of the heterotic string, where s is the dilaton, and, by duality, in

non-perturbative type ii regimes.

in the computation of the mass spectrum, one needs then to isolate the contributions
from the non-zero gs in the mass matrices. because of the existence of couplings suz 2
2
and st z 2
3 in the superpotential, there will be mass splittings of the oraifeartaigh type
in the sectors z2 and z3. it turns out that all supersymmetry breaking contributions

to the mass matrices are due to these superpotential couplings. we then conclude

that the spectrum is supersymmetric in the perturbative heterotic and moduli sector

(t, u, z1), and with oraifeartaigh pattern in the non-perturbative sectors:

z2 : m2

bosons = m2

3/2,

f ermions  2su m2
f ermions  2st m2
3/2.

z3 : m2

bosons = m2

as already observed in ref. [3], a similar analysis applied to the perturbative heterotic

string only would have led to a supersymmetric spectrum.

7expressed using non-normalized fermions. canonical normalization of the spinors would lead to

g = s + t + u.

14

in the special innite heterotic temperature limit discussed in ref.

[4], in which
h  0, all massive states decouple and consequently one recovers n = 2 unbro-
ken (rigid) supersymmetry in the eective (topological) eld theory of the remaining

massless hypermultiplets.

5 the high-temperature heterotic phase transition

as we already discussed, the high-temperature phase of n = 4 strings is described by a
non-critical string with central charge decit c = 4, provided the heterotic string is in
the weakly-coupled regime with g2
. one possible description is in terms

h < g2

c =

2+1
22

of the (5+1) super-liouville theory compactied (at least) on the temperature circle

with radius xed at the fermionic point r = qh/2. the perturbative stability of this
ground state is guaranteed when there is at least nsc = 2 superconformal symmetry
on the world-sheet, implying at least n = 1 supersymmetry in space-time. however,

our analysis of the previous section shows that the bosonfermion degeneracy is lost

at the non-perturbative level, even though the ground state remains supersymmetric.
an explicit example with nsc = 4 superconformal was given in ref. [16, 17]. it is
obtained when together with the temperature circle there is an additional compactied

coordinate on s1 with radius r6 = qh/2. these two circles are equivalent to a
compactication on [su(2)  su(2)]k at the limiting value of level k = 0. indeed, at
k = 0, only the 6 world-sheet fermionic su(2) su(2) coordinates survive, describing
a c = 2 system instead of c = 6 of k  , consistently with the decoupling of four
supercoordinates, c = 4. the central charge decit is compensated by the linear
motion of the dilaton associated to the liouville eld,  = qx with q2 = 1/(2h)
so that cl = 8h q2 = 4.

using the techniques developed in refs. [18, 17], one can derive the one-loop (per-

turbative) partition function in terms of the left- and right-moving degrees of freedom

on the world-sheet [4]:

z liouv[su(2)  su(2)]k=0 =

(5.45)

this partition function encodes a number of properties, which deserve some comments:

15

 the initial n = 4 supersymmetry is reduced to n = 2 (or n3 = 4) because of
the z2 projection generated by (h, g). this agrees with our eective eld the-

ory analysis of the high-temperature phase given previously. the (perturbative)

bosonic and fermionic mass uctuations are degenerate due to the remaining

n = 2 supersymmetry.

 the h = 0 sector does not have any massless uctuation due to the linear dilaton
background or to the coupling to temperature. the linear dilaton background
shifts the bosonic masses (squared) by m2

3/2, so that all bosons in this sector have
masses larger than or equal to m3/2. this is again in agreement with our eec-

tive theory analysis. similarly, fermion masses are shifted by the same amount
because of the s1

r temperature modication.

 in the h = 1, twisted, sector there are massless excitations as expected from

the (5+1) super-liouville theory [19, 20, 17].

 the 5+1 liouville background can be regarded as a euclidean ve-brane solution
wrapped on s1 s1 preserving one-half of the space-time supersymmetries (n =
2).

 the massless space-time fermions in the h = 1 sector are six-dimensional spinors
constructed with the left-moving supercoordinates  and ,  superghosts. they

are also spinors under the so(4)right constructed using four right-moving fermions

i which parametrize the fth and sixth compactied coordinates, with r =

r6 = qh/2. they are also vectors under the so(28) constructed with 28

right-moving fermions a (cr = 14).

 similarly, the massless space-time bosons are so(4)right spinors and so(28) vec-
tors. they are also spinors under the so(4)left constructed with the left-moving

fermions i for the fth and sixth coordinates compactied at the fermionic point.

together with the massless fermions, they form 28 n = 2 hypermultiplets.

these 28 massless hypermultiplets are the only states that survive in the zero-slope

limit and their eective eld theory is described by a n = 2 sigma-model on a hyper-

kahler manifold. this topological theory arises in the innite temperature limit of the

n = 4 strings after the heterotic hagedorn phase transition.

16

although the 5 + 1 liouville background is perturbatively stable due to the nsc = 4
superconformal symmetry, its stability is not ensured at the non-perturbative level

when the heterotic coupling is large:

2 + 1
22  0.8536.
indeed, the high-temperature heterotic phase only exists if g2

h(x) = e2(0qx) >
g2

h(x) is lower than a
critical value separating the heterotic and type ii high-temperature phases. thus
one expects a domain wall in space-time, at x0
 = 0, separating these two phases:
g2
h(qx0
)  0.8536. this domain wall problem can be avoided by replacing the (5 + 1)
super-liouville background with a more appropriate one with the same superconformal
properties, nsc = 4, obeying however the additional perturbative constraint g2
1 in the entire space-time.

h(x) <<

(5.46)

exact superstring solutions based on gauged wzw two-dimensional models with
nsc = 4 superconformal symmetries have been studied in the literature [21, 22, 16, 17,
23]. we now consider the relevant candidates with c = 4.

the rst one is the 5 + 1 super-liouville with c = 4, already examined above. it

is based on the 2d-current algebra:

u(1)c=4  u(1)3  u(1)r2=

h /2  u(1)r2
 u(1)c=4  u(1)3  so(4)k=1.

6=

h /2

(5.47)

another class of candidate background consists of the non-compact parafermionic

spaces described by gauged wzw models:

u(1)v,a #k=4 " sl(2, r)
" sl(2, r)

u(1)v,a #k=4  u(1)r2=

 "sl(2, r)

u(1)v,a #k=4 "sl(2, r)

h /2  u(1)r2
u(1)v,a #k=4  so(4)k=1,

6=

h /2

(5.48)

where indices a and b stand for the axial and vector wzw u(1) gaugings.

then, many backgrounds can be obtained by marginal deformations of the above,

preserving at least nsc = 2, or also by acting with s- or t-dualities on them.

as already explained, the appropriate background must verify the weak-coupling

constraint:

h(x) = e2 << 0.8536 ,
g2

(5.49)

17

in order to avoid the domain-wall problem, and in order to trust the perturbative

validity of the heterotic string background. this weak-coupling limitation is realized

in the axial parafermionic space.
h(x) is bounded in the
entire non-compact four-dimensional space, with coordinates {z, z, w, w}, provided
the initial value of g2

in this background, g2

0 = g2

h(x = 0) is small.

vanishes for asymptotically large values of |z| and |w| (asymptotically at space). this
space has maximal curvature when |z| = |w| = 0. this solution has a behaviour similar
to that of the liouville solution in the asymptotic regime |z|, |w|  . in this limit,
the dilaton  becomes linear when expressed in terms of the at coordinates xi:

 =  re[log z]  re[log w] = q1|x1|  q2|x2|,

(5.53)

where

x1 = re[log z],
x3 = im[log z],

x2 = re[log w],
x4 = im[log w],

and the line element is ds2 = 4(dxi)2. the important point here is that, for large
values of |x1| and |x2|,   0, in contrast to the liouville background in which  =
q1x1 +q2x2, the dilaton becomes positive and arbitrarily large in one half of the space,

violating the weak-coupling constraint (5.49).

we then conclude that the high-temperature phase is described by the above

parafermionic space, which is stable because of n = 2 supersymmetry. since it is

perturbative everywhere, the perturbative massive bosonic and fermionic uctuations

are always degenerate. on the other hand, the non-perturbative ones are superheavy

and decouple in the limit of vanishing coupling.

18

the asymptotic solution of the parafermionic space suggests an alternative super-

liouville solution with

 = 0  re[log z]  re[log w]

= 0  q1|x1|  q2|x2|.

(5.54)

the appearance of the absolute value of |xi| gives an upper bound on the coupling
constant provided qi are positive. however, the conical singularity at xi = 0 implies,
via the dynamical equation (4.35), the presence of curvature singularities at these

points,

rz z  = (2)(z), rw w = (2)(w).

(5.55)

in the above modied liouville background, the g2
compact four-dimensional space, provided the initial value g2

h(x) is bounded in the entire non-
h(x = 0) = e20 is

0 = g2

small.

6 conclusions

n = 4 superstring theories at nite temperature t correspond to a particular gauging

of the n = 4 supergravity. using techniques of n = 4 gauged supergravity, we

were able to compute the exact eective potential of all potential tachyonic modes,

describing all three perturbative instabilities of n = 4 strings (heterotic, type iia

and type iib) simultaneously. hagedorn instabilities of dierent perturbative string

descriptions appear as thermal dyonic 1/2-bps modes that become massless (and then

tachyonic) at (above) the corresponding hagedorn temperature.

we nd that the n = 4 thermal potential has a global stable minimum in a region

where the heterotic string is weakly-coupled, so that the four-dimensional string cou-
pling g2

2+1
22 . at the minimum, the temperature is xed in terms of the heterotic
string tension, the four internal supercoordinates decouple, and the system is described

h <

by a non-critical superstring in six dimensions. supersymmetry, although restored in

perturbation theory, appears to be broken at the non-perturbative level.

on the heterotic or type iia side, the high-temperature limit corresponds to a

topological theory described by an n = 2 supersymmetric sigma-model on a non-

trivial hyper-kahler manifold.
