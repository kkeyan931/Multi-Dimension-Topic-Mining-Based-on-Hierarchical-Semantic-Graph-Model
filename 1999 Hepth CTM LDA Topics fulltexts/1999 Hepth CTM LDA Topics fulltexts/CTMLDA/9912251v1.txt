abstract

in this work we derive the lorentz-pct-violating eective action
for a fermion in a constant and uniform electromagnetic eld using the
fock-schwinger proper time method and extract the exact value of the
coecient of the nonperturbatively induced chern-simons term.

lattely, there has been increasing interest in extensions of quantum elec-
trodynamics (qed) and the standard model (sm), where lorentz and pct
symmetries are broken in the fermion sector of the corresponding lagrangian
density, both from phenomenological[13] and eld-theoretical
standpoints[46].

if we consider radiative corrections, the lorentz- and pct-violating ax-
ial vector term induces a four dimensional analogue of the so-called chern-
simons (cs) term in the free electromagnetic lagrangian density of the ex-
tended maxwell electrodynamics, in much the same way as an odd-parity
mass term for fermions in qed in three-dimensional spacetime is responsi-
ble for the topological mass term of the gauge boson[7].

nevertheless, in both cases, ambiguities occur in the usual perturbation
theory, at leading order in the relevant expansion parameters: the coecient
of the induced cs term is regularization dependent and may only be xed
by physical requirements[8].

in this work we address the issue of generation of a lorentz- and pct-
violating cs term in the lagrangian density of extended qed in (3+1) di-
mensions, by considering a fermion in the presence of a constant and uniform
electromagnetic eld. employing the fock-schwinger proper time construct[9]
together with the analytic regularization method[10] for the singular fermion
greens function, we derive the renormalized eective action corresponding to
the cs term and extract its coecient without any further approximations,
confronting our result with those obtained from nonperturbative calculations
in the sense of reference [6] and other recent approaches [11,12].

the eective action for a fermion in the presence of an external electro-
magnetic eld in the extended version of qed considered in reference [1] is
dened by

se(a) = i logz dd exp(cid:18)iz d4x  [i/  m  ea/(x) + b/5] (cid:19)

= log det [i/  m  ea/(x) + b/5] ,

(1)

where b in the last term is a four-component constant quantity which picks
out a preferred direction in spacetime. such a term as it stands violates both
lorentz and pct symmetry.

we are only interested in the cs sector, which is linear in a(x) and
arises from the induced vacuum polarization contribution to the total fermion
current. this can be obtained according to the prescription[13]

= hj(x)i = ie tr(cid:16) g(x, x)(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x=x

(2)

where g(x, x) is the gauge invariant part of the fermion greens function
g(x, x), which satises the inhomogeneous dierential equation

[i/  m  ea/(x) + b/5] g(x, x) = (4)(x  x) .

now, we consider the greens function

g(x, x) = hx|[i/  m  ea/(x) + b/5]1|xi
= (i/ + m  ea/(x) + b/5) s(x, x) ,

where s(x, x) in momentum space satises the equation

[i/  m  ea/(x) + b/5][i/ + m  ea/(x) + b/5] s(p) = 1

this greens function is singular in the ultraviolet (uv) limit x  x and
such singularity will manifest as an uv logarithmic divergence in the lorentz-
and pct-violating sector of the eective action. in order to perform calcu-
lations leading to renormalized physical quantities, we adopt the analytic
regularization scheme[10], with the replacement

where the parameter  > 1 ultimately goes to zero to recover the original
theory. in the above expressions f is an arbitrary function of  which is
equal to the unity for  = 0. the factor m2 gives the correct dimension of
the regularized propagator associated to the squared hamiltonian h.

we also note that

(i  ea(x))hx(s)|x(0)i = hx|(s)|xi .

then, it follows from (8) that c(x, x) in (11) satises

(cid:18)i  ea(x)

we may choose ~e ~b such that the rst exponential in (11) also simplies,

we have performed a nonperturbative calculation of the coecient of the
cs contribution to the gauge-invariant eective action of a fermion in a con-
stant uniform electromagnetic eld. from (25), we see that the cs coecient
a exhibit a logarithmic contribution, which is analytic in b2, but singular for
m  0, in contrast with the opposite behavior of the corresponding contri-
bution found in reference [12], which is non-analytic in b2 and vanishes for
m  0. the later situation is expected neither in perturbation theory[4], at
leading order in b, nor in the lowest order approximation considered in [6]
and [11].

in our case, for b2 << m2 we have

the rst term in the last expression comes from the singular sector of the cs
eective action and is absent from the nite lowest order result derived in
reference [6]. however, the gauge-invariant vacuum polarization amplitude
is logarithmically divergent and must be regularized as a whole object. this
would lead to the above mentioned arbitrariness in the coecient of the cs
term. the same reasoning applies to the calculation performed in reference
[11].

the freedom of choice of f in the analytic regularization scheme we have
adopted is reected by the presence of a residual contribution proportional
to f 
0. this arbitrary constant is not determined from the symmetries of the
theory and can only be xed through subsidiary physical constraints set by
experiment[1],[3].
