abstract

we study the thermodynamics of four-dimensional kerr-newman-ads black
holes both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble. the stability
conditions are investigated, and the complete phase diagrams are obtained,
which include the hawking-page phase transition in the grand-canonical en-
semble. in the canonical case, one has a rst order transition between small
and large black holes, which disappears for suciently large electric charge or
angular momentum. this disappearance corresponds to a critical point in the
phase diagram. via the ads/cft conjecture, the obtained phase structure
is also relevant for the corresponding conformal eld theory living in a rotat-
ing einstein universe, in the presence of a global background u (1) current.
an interesting limit arises when the black holes preserve some supersymme-
try. these bps black holes correspond to highly degenerate zero temperature
states in the dual cft, which lives in an einstein universe rotating with the

i. introduction

the conjectured equivalence of string theory on anti-de sitter (ads) spaces (times some
compact manifold) and certain superconformal gauge theories living on the boundary of ads
[14] has lead to an increasing interest in asymptotically anti-de sitter black holes. this
interest is mainly based on the fact that the classical supergravity black hole solution can
furnish important informations on the dual gauge theory in the large n limit, n denoting
the rank of the gauge group. the standard example of this is the well-known schwarzschild-
ads black hole, whose thermodynamics was studied sixteen years ago by hawking and page
[5], who discovered a phase transition from thermal ads space to a black hole phase, as the
temperature increases. this means that at a certain temperature thermal radiation in ads
space becomes unstable, and eventually collapses to form a black hole. the hawking-page
phase transition was then reconsidered by witten [6] in the spirit of the ads/cft corre-
spondence. he observed that it can be interpreted as a transition from a low-temperature
conning to a high temperature deconning phase in the dual eld theory.
up to now, the study of black holes in the context of the ads/cft correspondence has been
extended in various directions, e. g. to black holes with non-spherical event horizon topolo-
gies [79] or to electrically charged reissner-nordstrom-ads (rnads) solutions [10,11],
following previous work on this subject performed in [1215]. thereby, some interesting ob-
servations have been made, like the striking resemblance of the rnads phase structure to
that of the van der waals-maxwell liquid-gas system [10,11]1, or the possible appearance of
so-called precursor states [16] in the cft dual of hyperbolic black holes [9]. furthermore,
the thermodynamics of r-charged black holes in four, ve and seven dimensions has been
studied in detail in [17]. another interesting extension is the inclusion of rotation, i. e. the
consideration of kerr-ads black holes [18,19]2. in this case, the dual cft lives in a rotating
einstein universe [18]. the authors of [18] studied the limit of critical angular velocity, at
which this einstein universe rotates with the speed of light, from both the cft and the
bulk side. recently, the ads/cft correspondence has been probed in [21] by comparing
in more detail the thermodynamics of rotating black holes in ve-dimensional anti-de sitter
space with that of n = 4 super yang-mills theory on a rotating einstein universe in four
dimensions.
in the present paper, we shall consider the charged rotating case, i. e. kerr-newman-ads
(knads) solutions. (note that the appearance of second-order phase transitions for kerr-
newman black holes in de sitter space, i. e. for positive cosmological constant, was rst
shown by davies [22]).
the remainder of this article is organized as follows:
in section ii we review the four-dimensional knads black hole, give the conserved quanti-
ties like mass and angular momentum, and recall the conditions under which some amount

holes [8].

of supersymmetry is preserved. in iii we calculate the euclidean action, using the method
of counterterms introduced in [2326]. in section iv the black hole thermodynamics is con-
sidered in both the canonical and grand canonical ensemble. the resulting phase structure
is elaborated, and the thermodynamical stability of the solutions is studied. finally, in v
our results are summarized and discussed in the context of the conformal eld theory in the
rotating einstein universe.

ii. kerr-newman-ads black holes

here we consider the usual charged rotating black hole in ads space.

its horizon is
homeomorphic to a sphere, and its metric, which is axisymmetric, reads in boyer-lindquist-

a study of the positive zeroes of the function r shows that the line element (1) describes a
3 and a black hole with an outer event horizon and an inner
naked singularity for m < mextr
cauchy horizon for m > mextr. finally, for m = mextr, the lapse function has a double root
and (1) represents an extremal black hole. one should also note that the solution is valid
only for a2 < l2; it becomes singular in the limit a2 = l2. in this critical limit, which has
been studied extensively in ref. [18] (cf. also [21]), the three dimensional einstein universe
at innity rotates with the speed of light. here we assume m to be larger than mextr and
a < l, so the metric (1) represents an ads black hole, with an event horizon at r = r+,
where r+ is the largest solution of r = 0. for the horizon area one gets

velocity  entering the thermodynamics is then given by the dierence

analogously to the case of an electric potential. for asymptotically at spacetimes, (14)
reduces to  = h , but for the knads black hole we get

 = h  ,

(14)

l2 =

a(1 + r2

(15)

this is exactly the angular velocity of the rotating einstein universe at innity [18]. to see
this, one rst applies an implicit coordinate transformation, which takes the standard ads
metric to the m = z = 0 knads form [18]. (15) can then be read o from the transformation
rule of the coordinate .
the fact that the angular velocity relevant to kerr-newman-ads black hole thermodynamics
turns out to be the one of the rotating einstein universe at the ads boundary, agrees nicely
with the ads/cft correspondence: if the knads black hole in the bulk is described by a
conformal eld theory living on the boundary, then the relevant angular velocity entering
the thermodynamics should be that of the rotating einstein universe at innity.
moreover, when  < 1/l, a timelike killing vector can be globally dened outside the event
horizon [18], in contrast to the asymptotically at case. then the rotating black hole can be
in equilibrium with rotating thermal radiation all the way out to innity, and a consistent
thermodynamics can be dened. when this condition is fulllled, the rotating einstein
universe spins slower than light, and an associated state can be dened on the boundary
cft. this is closely related with the fact that for  < 1/l there are no superradiant modes
[19].
the mass m and the angular momentum j can be dened by means of komar integrals,
4. taking ads space as reference background, one gets
using the killing vectors t/ and 

m =

j =

the charges are obtained by computing the ux of the electromagnetic eld tensor at innity,

4we have normalized the killing vectors so that the corresponding conserved quantities generate
the algebra so(3, 2), like it was done in ref. [29].

where  = t + h  is the null generator of the horizon and ae
of the vector potential.
finally, let us recall the conditions under which some amount of supersymmetry is preserved
by the kerr-newman-ads black holes. these objects were considered in [29,30] in the
context of gauged n = 2, d = 4 supergravity. there it was found that for

a denotes the electric part

the knads black holes preserve half of the supersymmetries. in the bps limit we have

(20)

(21)

(22)

furthermore, in the supersymmetric case, one has the relations

r2
+ = al,

 =

l

.

the latter relation means that in the bps limit, the einstein universe at innity, in which
the dual conformal eld theory lives, rotates eectively with the speed of light. an analogous
situation was found in ref. [18] for the supersymmetric rotating btz black hole.

iii. euclidean action

we turn now to the calculation of the euclidean action, which will then yield the ther-
in the action computation one
modynamic potentials relevant to the various ensembles.
usually encounters infrared divergences, which are regularized by subtracting a suitably
chosen background. such a procedure, however, in general is not unique; in some cases the
choice of reference background is ambiguous, e. g. for hyperbolic ads black holes [31,24].
recently, in order to regularize divergent integrals like those appearing in the computation
of the euclidean action, a dierent procedure has been proposed [2326]. this technique
was inspired by the ads/cft correspondence, and consists in adding suitable counterterms
ict to the action. these counterterms are built up with curvature invariants of a boundary
m (which is sent to innity after the integration), and thus obviously do not alter the bulk
equations of motion. this kind of procedure, which will also be employed in the present
paper, has the advantage to be free of ambiguities, which, on the contrary, are present in
the traditional approach in some particular cases, like mentioned above.

to start with, we write the euclidean einstein-maxwell action in the form

i = ibulk + isurf + ict = 

1

16gzm

8gzm

d4x g(cid:2)r  2  f 2(cid:3)
d3x h k + ict ,

7

(23)

 = 3/l2 being the 4-dimensional cosmological constant, with l the radius of ads space.
the action (23) diers from the familiar one by the presence of the last term, which contains
all surface counterterms needed to assure convergence of the integrals. in four dimensions
it reads [24]

ict =zm

d3x h(cid:20)2

8r2(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

hab and rab denoting the metric and ricci curvature of the (arbitrary) boundary m.

the variation of the bulk integral with respect to the elds gives

(24)

(25)

i =

f 2gab(cid:19)(cid:21) gab
d3x h naf abab,

where na is the outward pointing unit normal to m. asking for a stationary point of the
action, the bulk integrals in eq. (25) yield the einstein-maxwell eld equations

gab + gab = tab ,

af ab = 0,

where we have dened the electromagnetic stress tensor

tab = 2f c

afcb

f 2gab ,

(26)

(27)

while the surface integral has to vanish to have a dierentiable action functional and a well
dened action principle. this imposes the boundary condition aa = 0 on m. this action
is thus appropriate to study the ensemble with xed electric potential e and xed magnetic
charge qm.
to study the canonical ensemble with xed magnetic and electric charge, we have to add
another boundary term to impose xed qe as a boundary condition at innity [32], restoring
the electromagnetic duality. the appropriate action in this case is

i = i 

1

4gzm

d3x h naf abab,

and its variation reads

 i = (bulk terms) 

1

4gzm

d3x h ab (nafab) .

(28)

(29)

the bulk contribution yields again the einstein-maxwell equations, while the vanishing of
the surface term, needed to have a dierentiable action functional, requires (nafab) = 0 at
innity as a boundary condition.

now the evaluation of the euclidean action is a straightforward computation. first of

all, on shell the bulk contribution simplies to

l2(cid:21) .

(30)

then one chooses the boundary m = s 1  s 2, s 2 being a 2-sphere with a large radius,
which has to be sent to innity after the integration. since the metric is stationary, the
time integration gives rise to a simple multiplicative factor . the integration on the other
variables requires a little bit of work, but anyway it can be performed in a closed manner.

(32)

valid for xed potential and xed charge respectively. in the following, we will consider only
the case of vanishing magnetic charge, qm = 0, so we set qe = q and qe = q.

the behaviour of the obtained actions as functions of r+ determines the thermodynamical
properties of the black holes. it will be discussed in detail in section iv. note that both
actions are singular in the extremal case (m = mextr) and also for  = 0. the singularity
for extremal black holes comes from the divergence of the inverse temperature . since one
divides the action by  in order to obtain the thermodynamical potentials, the latter are
well-dened also for t = 0.
in the last section we have already indicated how to calculate physical conserved quantities
by evaluating komar integrals. this traditional technique involves the subtraction of a
suitably chosen reference background (in our case ads space), in order to regularize infrared-
divergent integrals.
in the approach we are considering, instead, one does not use any
reference background, and so it seems quite natural to compute the conserved charges by
the direct use of the nite action (23), applying the method developed by brown and york
[33].

let us briey resume how this formalism works. we indicate by ua the unit normal
vector of a space-like hyper-surface 3st at constant t and by m the spatial boundary of
the spacetime manifold m, with induced metric hab. moreover,  = s 2 is the spacelike
intersection 3st  m embedded in m with induced metric ab.

one starts by deriving the local surface energy-momentum stress tensor

i
hab

,

(33)

 ab =

2

h

which characterizes the entire system, including contributions from gravitation and (eventu-
ally) matter. it is related to the stress energy tensor t ab = 2
in a rather complicated
g
way.

i
gab

then, for any killing vector eld a associated with an isometry of the boundary three-

metric, one denes the conserved charge 5

5note that in the conventions of [33] an additional minus sign appears in the conserved charges

d2x  ua abb .

q =z

now, a straightforward application of (33) with the action (23) gives

 ab =

l

hab  l(cid:18)rab

habr(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(34)

(35)

the rst term on the right-hand side of eq. (35) results from the boundary term in the
action, while all other terms are due to the presence of the counterterms we added in order
to have nite quantities, when the boundary is sent to innity. employing the ads/cft
correspondence, the result (35) can also be interpreted as the expectation value of the
stress tensor in the boundary conformal eld theory. in the case of the kerr-newman-ads
geometry, we choose m to be a three-surface of xed r, and obtain for  ab

8g =

all other components vanishing. as expected, the presence of counterterms cures also the
divergences of the charges. in fact we get

m = qt/ =

j = q =

(37)

(38)

in full agreement with the results (16) obtained with komar integrals.

iv. thermodynamics

a. generalized smarr formula

using the expressions (16) for mass and angular momentum, (7) for the horizon area, and
the fact that r = 0 for r = r+, one obtains by simple algebraic manipulations a generalized
smarr formula for kerr-newman-ads black holes, which reads

(34); this comes from the fact that the denition of the extrinsic curvatures in [33] diers from
ours by a factor of 1.

(39)

in the limit l   this formula reduces to the usual smarr formula for asymptotically at
kerr-newman solutions [34,35], so one can consider the last two terms on the right-hand
side as ads corrections.
relation (39) holds for classical black holes, but contains all the information about the
thermodynamic state of the black hole, if one identies the black hole entropy with one
quarter of the horizon area6,

s = a
4

.

(40)

in the next subsection, eq. (40) will be conrmed, using the euclidean actions (31), (32),
and standard thermodynamical relations.
we may then regard the parameters s, j and q as a complete set of energetic extensive
parameters for the black hole thermodynamical fundamental relation m = m(s, j, q),

(41)

one can then dene the quantities conjugate to s, j and q. these are the temperature

(42)

(43)

(44)

these expressions reduce to the corresponding asymptotically at kerr-newman expressions
in the l   limit [35]. the obtained quantities satisfy the rst law of thermodynamics

dm = t ds + dj + dq.

(45)

furthermore, by eliminating m from (42)(44) using (41), it is possible to obtain three
equations of state for the knads black holes.
one easily veries that the relations (42), (43) and (44) for temperature, angular velocity
and electric potential respectively, coincide with equations (8), (15) and (18) found in section

6in the following we set g = 1.

11

ii.
another quantity of interest is the thermal capacity cj,q at constant angular momentum
and charge, which, as we shall see in section iv c, is relevant in the stability analysis of the
canonical ensemble. it reads

cj,q = t

in the above analysis, we have treated the cosmological constant as a xed parameter;
however, as shown by henneaux and teitelboim [36], it is possible to induce it from a three
form gauge potential coupled to the gravitational eld. the interest of this mechanism
resides in that it follows from kaluza-klein reduction of supergravity theory [37], and in
particular it is relevant for the compactication of m-theory on s 7. we can thus promote
the cosmological constant to a thermodynamic state variable. its conjugate variable  reads

(47)

now we can consider ensembles where  is allowed to uctuate, and the rst law reads

dm = t ds + dj + dq + d.

(48)

finally, if we regard m as a function of s, j, q2 and , it is a homogeneous function of
degree 1/2. applying eulers theorem we obtain

again, sending l to innity we recover the usual smarr law, and the last term is an ads
correction.

b. thermodynamic potentials from the euclidean action

we now turn to the denition of the thermodynamic potentials from the euclidean ac-
tions (32) and (31), relevant for the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble respectively.
let us rst treat the latter case. the gibbs potential g(t, , ) is dened by

g(t, , ) =

which turn out to coincide precisely with the expressions (40), (16) and (17). in particular,

with respect to s, j and q.

c. stability analysis

the stability of a thermodynamical system with respect to small variations of the
thermodynamic coordinates, is usually studied by analyzing the behaviour of the entropy
s(m, j, q). the stability requires that the entropy hypersurface lie everywhere below its
family of tangent hyperplanes, as to say that the entropy must be a concave function of
the entropic extensive parameters. this will place some restrictions on physical observables.

13

for example, the thermal capacity must be positive in any stable system. the stability can
also be studied by using other thermodynamic potentials, as for example the energy or its
legendre transforms, which have to be convex functions of their extensive variables, and
concave functions of their intensive variables. the use of one thermodynamic potential with
respect to another is of course a matter of convenience, depending on the ensemble one is
dealing with. here we are mainly interested in nding the zones where the system is locally
stable. these zones are bounded by critical hypersurfaces, on which

det(cid:18) 2s

xixj(cid:19) = 0,

(56)

where xi = m, j, q.
in the canonical ensemble, charges and angular momentum are xed parameters and for this
reason, the positivity of the thermal capacity cj,q is sucient to assure stability [17]. this
means that the points (hypersurfaces) where cj,q vanishes or diverges represent the critical
hypersurfaces we are looking for. the equation of such surfaces can easily be obtained by
deriving the expression for t , eq. (42) (where m is given by (41)), with respect to s and
requiring it to vanish (or to diverge). one can see that the equation t /s = 0, has only
one physically acceptable solution, which reads 7

(57)

in the grand-canonical ensemble the critical surfaces can be determined by requiring that the
determinant of the whole hessian of the gibbs potential g(t, , ) be vanishing (diverging)
[17]. this yields an equation which can easily be resolved for the charge parameter q. the

these stability conditions will be analyzed in the following subsections.

d. canonical ensemble

in the canonical ensemble, we study the black holes holding the temperature t , the
angular momentum j and the charge q xed. the associated thermodynamic potential is

the helmholtz free energy f (t, j, q) (53). we shall analyze the thermodynamics in this
ensemble in the (t, j)-plane, keeping the charge xed. it immediately follows that in this
plane the extremal black hole solutions are represented by the ordinate axis t = 0, and the
half-plane t > 0 corresponds to the nonextremal solutions.
we shall begin by considering the local stability of the black holes. as explained in section
iv c, local stability in the canonical ensemble is equivalent to the positivity of the thermal
capacity (46). the behaviour of the thermal capacity can be more easily understood from
the state equation t = t (s, j, q) at xed j and q, eq. 42. in gure 1 we have reported

fig. 1. state equation t = t (s). the plot shows the t (s) curves at xed q = 0 for j = 0
(the upper curve), 0.005, 0.01, 0.0236, 0.05 and 0.1 (the lower curve). for jc  0.0236 the local
extrema merge in a point of inection, and for higher j the curve is monotonically increasing. for
q 6= 0, see the text.
these curves for q = 0 and dierent values of j. when j = 0, the usual schwarzschild-
ads behaviour is reproduced; the curve rst decrases towards a minimum, corresponding
to the branch of small unstable black holes, then increases along the branch of large stable
black holes. as soon as j 6= 0, a branch of stable small black holes appears, separated
from the branch of large black holes by intermediate unstable black holes. this results in
the appearance of two phases in the canonical ensemble, a small black hole phase and a
large black hole phase, in analogy to what was found in [10] for charged ads black holes
and in [8] for stringy-corrected black holes. while j grows, the local maximum of t (s)
decreases, and eventually degenerates for jc  0.0236 into a point of inection, signalling a
second order phase transition for the kerr-ads black hole. for j > jc, the curve t (s) is
monotonically increasing, and we are left with a unique phase of black holes. the behaviour
near this critical point is completely analogous to a liquid/vapour system described by the
van der waals equation.
in the kerr-newman-ads case, one can repeat this analysis along the same lines; for 0 <
q < qc, where qc  0.166, we obtain a behaviour analogous to that of the kerr-ads black
hole, with the dierence that the stable small black hole branch appears already at zero
angular momentum [10]. it is then possible to obtain the critical value jc(q), where the
point of inection is located, as a function of the charge. for q = qc the small black hole
phase disappears, and for larger values of the charge the function t (s) is monotonically

15

increasing for any angular momentum, and hence a unique stable black hole phase exists.
hence the curve of second order critical points ends in j = 0, q = qc. the resulting

plot the curve corresponds to a line of second order critical points. outside the region bounded
by it, there is a unique black hole phase. inside the region, one has a small black hole phase at
low temperatures and a large black hole phase at high temperatures, separated by a rst order
phase transition. in the right plot we have drawn the lines where the thermal capacity diverges,
for q = 0, 0.05, 0.091, 0.12, 0.15 and 0.16 respectively from the outer to the inner curve. outside
these regions the thermal capacity is positive. the vertical line represents the limit where  = 1/l;
for q > 0.091 the entire instability region has  < 1/l.

phase diagram is shown in gure 2; the solid line corresponds to the second order critical
points. inside the curve we have a region where two phases of black holes are allowed, with
a rst order transition between a small black hole phase and a large black hole phase as the
temperature is increased, the two phases being separated by a coexistence curve.
in the second graph of gure 2 we have visualized the instability region in the (, j)-plane.
in the uncharged case we have stable black holes for large j and thermodynamic instability
below the curve. as q grows, the instability region shrinks and disappears for the critical
charge qc. the points inside the instability region correspond to mixed phases of small/large
black holes, obtained by means of a maxwell-like construction.

the phase diagrams in the (t, j)-plane for the canonical ensemble are shown in gure
3. the left diagram corresponds to the uncharged kerr-ads black hole, while the one on
the right side is plotted for q = 0.05 and shows the qualitative behaviour of the kerr-
newman-ads black holes with electric charge ranging in the interval 0 < q < qc.
in
these diagrams, we have plotted the curves on which the specic heat diverges. outside
the region bounded by them, every point (t, j, q) of the diagram corresponds to a single
black hole solution, which is locally stable (its thermal capacity is positive). in contrast,
inside the region bounded by these curves, which are indicated by c < 0 in the gure, every
point (t, j, q) corresponds in fact to three dierent black hole solutions. to elucidate this
point let us go back to the curves t (s) of gure 1. the divergence of the thermal capacity
obviously corresponds to the local extrema of t (s). for every temperature between that of
the local minimum and that of the local maximum of t (s), we have three black holes: a

fig. 3. phase diagrams in the (t, j) plane. the phase diagram of the q = 0 kerr-ads
black hole is plotted on the left, while the diagram for kerr-newman-ads black holes with charge
0 < q < qc  0.166 is shown on the right. for higher charge the diagram is trivial, as one is
left with a unique stable black hole phase. the left branch of the solid curve is the rst order
small/large phase transition curve. it ends in a cusp, where a second order phase transition occurs.

small metastable black hole, an unstable intermediate one, and a large stable one, which are
represented by a single point in the (t, j, q)-diagram. if we start from a small stable black
hole and increase its temperature while holding j and q xed, as we reach the temperature
of the local minimum of t (s), it undergoes a rst order phase transition with a jump in the
entropy, and reaches the black hole represented by the local minimum of t (s). then, the
state will follow the branch of large stable black holes. hence the low temperature branch
of the cjq =  curve corresponds to a rst order phase transition line between a small
black hole phase and a large black hole phase. this line ends in a critical point located in
the cusp, where the transition degenerates to a second order phase transition. then, inside
the region bounded by the cjq =  curve, the thermodynamically stable state is simply a
locally stable large black hole phase. finally, for kerr-newman-ads black holes with charge
q > qc the instability region and the small/large transition disappear, leaving a unique
phase of stable black holes.
the local stability is however not sucient to ensure global stability; the full problem is very
hard to tackle, but we could at least try to compare the free energy of the black hole with
that of some reference background like thermal ads space, which can lead to a hawking-
page phase transition [5]. in doing so, however, one encounters the problem that pure ads
space is not a solution of the einstein-maxwell equations with electric charge q as boundary
condition. furthermore, ads space has no angular momentum, as j = 0 for m = 0 (cf. (16)).
therefore, it is not a suitable reference background in the canonical ensemble, which has
xed q and j. one should compare the free energy of the black hole with that of other
possible solutions, such as ads space lled with a gas of charged particles carrying also
angular momentum j, or a kerr-newman-ads black hole with part of the total charge and
angular momentum carried by a gas of such particles gravitating outside its horizon [11].
only for q = j = 0, i. e. the schwarzschild-ads black hole, pure ads space contributes to
the path integral and should be taken into account, as it was done in [5]. in the charged

17

rotating case, however, the question of global stability and hawking-page phase transitions
remains unsettled.
finally, we have to examine the stationarity condition  < 1/l, which is needed to have
thermodynamic equilibrium, and a well-dened holographic thermal state in the boundary
cft. the curve  = 1/l can be dened parametrically in the (t, j)-plane by the equations

t = 1/(2l). for charges 0 < q < 1/8 the qualitative behaviour is similar to the intermediate
curve, while for higher charges the corresponding curves behave like the one with q = 0.5.

region i we have  > 1/l and in region ii we have  < 1/l. the intersection of these curves with
the t = 0 axis corresponds to supersymmetric black holes.

the electric charge, and has been summarized in gure 4. for q = 0, the curve is strictly
decreasing from the asymptote and ends at j = 0 for innite temperature. if 0 < q < 1/8,
the innite temperature branch is deformed, curves back towards the j axis and intersects
it in the supersymmetric point. finally, for q > 1/8, the curve remains at t < 1/2l,
and is strictly increasing from its intersection with the ordinate axis, again describing a
supersymmetric black hole, to the asymptote.
in any case the  = 1/l curve splits the
(t, j)-plane into two regions, named i and ii in gure 4. black holes in region i, at the
left of the  = 1/l curve, spin at angular velocity  greater than 1/l and show superradiant

18

instability. on the other hand, black holes in region ii, at the right of the curve, have
 < 1/l, and have a well-dened thermodynamics. however, this is not the whole story.
inside the regions of local instability shown in gure 3, every point (t, j, q) corresponds in
fact to three black hole solutions: an unstable, a metastable and a locally stable black hole.
it is possible to verify that the locally stable one spins at  < 1/l, and hence the whole
region of  < 1/l black holes is the union of region ii and the instability region. this stems
from the fact that the locally stable black hole, at xed (t, j, q), is the one with maximum
entropy, and that (s, j, q) is a decreasing function of s at xed j and q.

diagram is characteristic for all black holes with 0 < q < qc. the dotted curve represents the line
 = 1/l.

the full phase diagram, taking into account the restriction on the angular velocity, is re-
ported in gure 5. it implies that part of the small/large black hole phase transition has no
dual cft analogue, as in this region one has  > 1/l, and so the einstein universe in which
the dual cft lives would have to rotate faster than light. however the second order critical
point lies in the  < 1/l region. furthermore, for charged black holes, this phase transition
occurs at  < 1/l for suciently small angular momentum, and has therefore an analogue
on the cft side.

e. grand-canonical ensemble

as described in section iv b, the thermodynamics of the grand-canonical ensemble can
be extracted from the gibbs potential g(t, , ). the natural variables for this ensemble
are the intensive parameters t,  and ; however, to simplify the analysis, we shall study
the thermodynamics in the (r+, a)-plane, at xed electric potential .
in this plane, the black holes with genuine event horizon are restricted to the region
aextr(r+, )  a  a+

extr(r+, ) with a < l, where

aextr(r+, ) =

(61)

between these two curves the black holes have a bifurcate horizon, on the curves they are
extremal, and outside the solution shows a naked singularity. if ||  1, aextr is negative,
and the entire region below the curve a+
extr(r+, ) represents black hole solutions. for  > 1,
aextr is positive for 0  r+  lp(2  1)/3; if r+ lies in this range, aextr determines a new
region with naked singularities, and the black holes are found between the two curves. for
r+ outside of this interval, all the points represent black holes, as long as a < l. finally,
in the limit   , the two curves merge and only a line of extremal black holes with
r+ = a < l survives.
another relevant information in the thermodynamic diagram is given by the region where
the killing vector t + h is timelike all the way out to innity. it is easy to see that this
condition is satised for a  r2
+/l, and so is always fullled for r+ > l, as we assumed a < l.
one readily veries that the condition a  r2
+/l is equivalent to  < 1/l. in the diagrams,
the region at the right of the curve a = r2
+/l is the region where the black hole can be in
thermal and dynamical equilibrium with radiation, and the rotating einstein universe at the
boundary spins slower than light.
let us now turn to the stability analysis of the black hole. we shall begin with local stability.
the curve separating stable from unstable regions is given by eq. (58). in fact this equation
can be solved for a(r+, ) after having substituted q in terms of  by means of (18); the result
is quite complicated, but nevertheless adequate for visualizing the local stability regions in
the (r+, )-plane.
however locally stable black holes can decay into other states with lower free energy. in
the case of the grand-canonical ensemble, another possible state is given by ads space,
which can have arbitrary electric potential , constant all over the spacetime. the gibbs
free energy of ads space lled with thermal radiation vanishes identically, hence the global
stability can be investigated by studying the sign of g(t, , ). the free energy of the black
hole is negative for

+(a, ) 

l2

l2 2!  r2

hp(a, ),

(62)

which means that the black hole dominates in this region. for r+ = rhp(a, ) there is a
rst order phase transition line, with a discontinuity in the entropy, and for r+ < rhp(a, )
the ads solution is globally preferred. however we stress that this does not exhaust the
question of global stability for these black holes, as other solutions with lower free energy
may exist [11]. indeed, there are regions in the (r+, a)-plane in which the black hole, though
being unstable, has lower free energy that ads space; it is plausible that a new solution
exists which minimizes the gibbs potential.
finally we observe that the  = 1/l curve, the local stability curve and the hawking-page
transition curve intersect at the point (r+ = l, a = l) for any choice of the electric potential.
for  = c = 1 these three curves coincide; for  < c we nd the  = 1/l curve, the
local stability curve and the hawking-page transition curve in this order from the left to the
right, while for  > c they appear in the reverse order.
we have summarized this analysis in gure 6, which shows the phase structure in the (r+, a)-
plane for various values of the electric potential. we see that for  < c = 1, the hawking-
page transition curve is the one most to the right; it separates a large r+ phase of large black

20

holes and an ads phase, which dominates over black holes with small r+. inside the ads
phase region, with increasing r+, we rst have a zone of naked singularities separated by
the extremality line from a region with genuine black holes, which however do not possess a
boundary cft analogue, as they have  > 1/l, and which are furthermore locally unstable.
in the next region we nd locally unstable black holes which rotate slower than light, and
nally a region with locally stable but globally unstable black holes which ends on the
hawking-page transition curve. these regions are anyway dominated by the ads phase.
for  > c the situation is more subtle; a new branch of extremal black holes appears
and bounds a region of naked singularities for small a. for small r+ we again have the
ads dominated phase, but at the right of the hawking-page transition curve we nd (a) a
region with locally unstable black holes with  > 1/l, having however negative gibbs free
energy, so they are preferred with respect to ads space, (b) a region with stable black holes
with  > 1/l, and nally (c) a region of stable black holes with  < 1/l. this raises the
question for region (a) whether there exists at all a thermodynamically stable state for this
range of parameters. furthermore, the region dened by a < aextr(r+, ) represents naked
singularities which have a lower gibbs free energy than ads space itself.

v. concluding remarks

in the present paper, we studied the thermodynamics of the four-dimensional kerr-
newman-ads black hole both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble. thereby
we encountered an interesting phase structure. in the canonical ensemble, we found a small-
large black hole rst order phase transition, which disappears for suciently large electric
charge or angular momentum.
in the points where the small-large transition disappears,
the rst order phase transition degenerates to a higher order one. as pure ads space is
not a solution of the einstein-maxwell eld equations with xed electric charge, we cannot
compare the black hole helmholtz free energy with that of pure ads space, in order to
study global stability. it would therefore be desirable to have another reference background
to our disposal, which describes ads space lled with charged rotating particles. another
possibility would be to have a knads black hole surrounded by a gas of particles carrying
part of the total charge and angular momentum (cf. the discussion in [11]).

as ads space can have arbitrary constant electric potential, we can compare the gibbs
free energy of the black hole with that of ads space in the grand-canonical ensemble. in
this way, we found the hawking-page transition curve. also in this context, some intriguing
features arise, e. g. one nds black holes which are locally unstable, but nevertheless have
lower gibbs free energy than ads space itself. there is also a region of naked singularities
in the (r+, a)-phase diagram, which are energetically preferred with respect to ads space.
it would be interesting to study if these naked singularities play some role in the dual cft.
we hope to have claried that a consistent treatment of rotating ads black hole ther-
modynamics requires the usage of the angular velocity  of the rotating einstein universe,
in which the dual conformal eld theory lives. this angular velocity diers from that of the
event horizon, which enters the thermodynamical description of asymptotically at black
holes. the reason for this discrepancy is that the angular velocity (13) appearing in the
canonical form of the metric, does not vanish at innity. (it even has the opposite sign of

21

h , cf. (13)). the fact that a consistent thermodynamics can be formulated using  is in
full agreement with the ads/cft correspondence.

the black holes we have considered can also be lifted to eleven dimensions, as solutions
of n = 1, d = 11 supergravity [10,38]. these solutions represent the near-horizon limit of
m2-branes8 rotating both in a plane parallel to the worldvolume, and in a plane orthogonal
to the worldvolume [19], the latter rotation giving rise to the electric charge q (r-charge)
upon kaluza-klein compactication9. the thermodynamic structure we have elaborated,
corresponds then to that of the worldvolume eld theory of n coincident such branes.

it would be very interesting to give a microscopic description of the kerr-newman-ads
black holes in terms of this dual cft. let us recall in this context that only black holes
whose angular velocity satises

 

1
l

(63)

correspond to thermal states in the dual eld theory, as otherwise the rotating einstein
universe, in which the dual cft lives, would rotate faster than light. one easily shows that
for zero temperature black holes, condition (63) implies

q2  a(a + 1)2

(64)

for the electric charge and rotation parameter appearing in the metric. if the bound (64)
is satised, we have a bps state.
it would be interesting to study if the corresponding
eld theory at weak coupling reproduces the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the black hole
in this bps limit. as the m2-brane worldvolume eld theory is the strong coupling limit
(conformal point) of the d2-brane worldvolume theory [1], the relevant gauge theory would
be that on the worldvolume of d2-branes. in any case, in the presence of a global background
u(1) current (corresponding to the black hole charge q), the zero temperature state of the
dual eld theory must be highly degenerate, as the extremal black hole has nonvanishing
entropy 10. it would also be interesting to consider the ve-dimensional case, corresponding
to n = 4, d = 4 sym on a rotating einstein universe [18]. however, the generalization of
the rotating ve-dimensional ads black holes found in [18] to nonzero charge seems to be
a nontrivial task. if such a solution were known, one could study if there exist bps states
(which can only occur for nonzero charge [18]), and compare their entropy with the one
obtained on the cft side. apart from the possiblity of identifying black hole microstates,
this would also be a check of the ads/cft correspondence.

8strictly speaking, one is dealing with m2-branes wrapped on a two-sphere.

9a thermodynamical discussion of branes rotating in a plane orthogonal to the worldvolume can
be found in [3941]. in [39], a eld theory model of rotating d3-branes was proposed. this was
later generalized in [42] to rotating m-branes.

10note that for zero u (1) current, the extremal black holes have  > 1/l [18], and therefore do
not correspond to states in the cft.

fig. 6. phase structure in the grand-canonical ensemble in the (r+, a)-plane, for various values of
the electric potential . for  = 0 we have, from the left to the right, the  = 1/l curve, the line
bounding the stability region, and the hawking-page transition curve. for 0 <  < c = 1, in
addition to these three lines, the extremality curve appears at the left. for the critical potential
 = c, the  = 1/l curve, the stability bound, and the hawking-page transition line coalesce.
finally, for  > c, an additional extremality line appears (the one intersecting the r+ axis twice),
and the order of the  = 1/l curve, the stability bound, and the hawking-page transition line is
reversed. the various regions bounded by these curves are discussed in the text.
