it is shown that static solutions with a nite curvature at the horizon

may exist in dilaton gravity at temperatures t 6= th (including t = 0)
where th is the hawking one. hawking radiation is absent and the state of a

system represents thermal excitation over the boulware vacuum. the horizon

remains unattainable for a observer because of thermal divergences in the

stress-energy of quantum elds there. however, the curvature at the horizon

is nite, when measured from outside, since these divergences are compensated

by those in gradients of a dilaton eld. spacetimes under consideration are

geodesically incomplete and the coupling between dilaton and gravity diverges

at the horizon, so we have singularity without singularity.

in recent years a great interest focused on two-dimensional (2d) theories of dilaton grav-

ity. one of the reason of this consists in the possibility to trace in detail the process of black

hole evaporation since on the semiclassical level spacetime evolution is described by dieren-

tial equations directly following from the lagrangian even if quantum eects are taken into

account [1]. it turned out that such a kind of theories possesses a rather rich set of exactly

solvable models. these circumstances give us hope to get insight into subtle features of black

hole evolution. especially important is the question whether nal geometry can be regular

or not. in ref. [2] (bpp) the exactly solvable model was proposed in which, under certain

choice of parameters, a black hole leaves after evaporation everywhere regular geodesically

complete geometry which innitely extends to a region of strong coupling (semi-innite

1

throat). in so doing, quantum elds are in the radiationless state in which eects of vacuum

polarization tend to zero at minkowski innity. in ref. [3] (cn) more general model was

suggested interpolating between the bpp and rst [4] ones. the qualitatively new feature

of the cn model consists in that, although a static radiationless geometry with curvature

nite everywhere is still possible, it becomes geodesically incomplete.

meanwhile, the cn model possesses some other intriguing features which were not noticed

in [3]. namely, we will show below that at the boundary of spacetime g00  0, so it
represents a killing horizon. at this point stresses of quantum elds due to back reaction

diverge since the solution under discussion is radiationless (temperature t = 0) whereas the

usual condition of their niteness demands t = th where th is the hawking temperature

(see, for instance, [5]). thus, the intimate connection between regularity of a geometry on a

horizon and equality of temperatures t = th ceases to exist and we have a static geometry

with a nite curvature at the horizon at t 6= th and the innite quantum stresses!
this respect the signicance of the cn model is beyond the context of concrete problems of

in

2d dilaton gravity: relative simplicity of the 2d case enables us in the best possible way

to review unbiasedly some fundamentals of black hole physics and elucidate opportunities

which probably may occur in a 4d world but remain hidden because of complexity of the

situation in the latter case.

in the present paper we argue also that there exists a whole range of temperatures for

which properties of spacetime sketched above hold true. we exploit exactly solvable models

of 2d gravity [6], [7] (with respect to which the cn one is the particular case) and show that

the results remain valid for a whole class of such theories provided the coupling between

gravitation and dilaton obeys some general restrictions.

let us consider the system described by the action

i = i0 + ip l

where

i0 =

d2xg[f ()r + v ()()2 + u()],

(2)

ip l is the polyakov-liouville action [8] incorporating eects of hawking radiation and its

back reaction on the background metric for a multiplet of n scalar elds, and the boundary

terms omitted. in what follows we will use the quantities t dened according to

i =

2 z d2xq|g|gt,

so the led equations which are obtained by varying a metric have the form t = 0.

in the conformal gauge

ds2 = e2dx+dx

(3)

(4)

the polyakov-liouville action reads ip l =  2

 r d2xg()2. af-

2 r d2xg[v ()2 + 2f + 2()2 + 42e], where by denition  = r d,  = u /u.

in what follows we restrict ourselves by exactly solvable models of dilaton gravity [6], [7]
that implies the constraint on the form of the potential v = (u  
2 ) + (u  )2 where
u = f . in what follows we consider only the simplest choice  = 0, so

v = (u

)

(5)

introducing new elds  and  instead of  and  according to f  f   = 2,
 r d2xg{[()2  ()2 +
 = 2(    ), after simple rearrangement we obtain i = 1
22e2()}. corresponding equations of motion have the form 2+ = 2e2(),
2+ = 2e2(). one can choose the gauge  =  whence + f = 2. this
equation should be supplemented by the constraint equations t++ = t = 0 (t = 2 i
g ).

the expressions for the classical parts of t++ and t follow directly from the general

expression for covariant components

t (0)

2{2(gf  f )  ug + 2v   gv ()2},

which can be obtained by varying the action i0. the formula for the quantum contribution

can be obtained from the conservation law and conformal anomaly and has the form

where the function t(x) are determined by the boundary conditions. from (6) and (7) we

have the equation 2


f = 2t. to nd the explicit form of t, let us impose the condition

that at the right innity quantum elds should be at a nite temperature t . then in
asymptotically at coordinates  = t   connected with x according to x = ex
stresses take the form t ()
 = t 2/12 at    where ds2 = d+d. on the other
hand, asymptotically 2   ln(2x+x) to match the region of a linear dilaton vacuum

(8)

the expressions (8) describe generic static congurations gravitational and dilaton elds

in exactly solvable models of dilaton gravity at nite temperatures. hereafter we concentrate

ourselves on f () such that f () has one simple minimum at some real 0 where f (0) = 0.

the well known example is the rst model [4]. let the coecient b > 0. the structure of

spacetime depends crucially on the relationship between fmin = f (y0) (the minimum value

of f (y) achieved in the point y0) and f (0). it follows from (8) that d
. if fmin <
f (0), the dilaton value changes monotonically from  =  at right innity y =  to
 = 0 where the spacetime is singular and cannot be continued further. for the rst model

dy = f (y)

()

f



the structure of spacetime at the equilibrium temperature t = t0 is analyzed in detail in

[9] (see also generalization in [7]). if fmin > f (0), the dilaton eld takes its values in the
limits (, 1) where 1 < 0, f () changes its sign nowhere.

in what follows we dwell upon on the special case f (0) = fmin, so c = c  where

c  = f (0) + c0, c0 =

then f (y) and f () turn into zero simultaneously and d

dy does not changes its sign, so the
dependence (y) is monotonic. as a result,    when y  , i.e. at the event horizon.
in the vicinity of the point y0 one can use the power expansion, so the equality f () = f (y)

let us consider the concrete example. we assume that the functions f (y) and f () obey

the conditions described above which guarantee the absence of the singularity outside the

horizon. we do not specify the exact form of f () in the whole region and only assume that

in the vicinity of the horizon it reads

f  e2 + b,   .

(10)

the condition (5) of exact solvability implies that v  (b  2e2) + 2
we nd that at y

  , g  e2|y|(b/b1), r  e2|y|(2b/b1)

(11)

thus, if b/b < 1 the surface y =  represent a horizon where g = 0. in the schwarzschild
gauge x = r dg, ds2 = gdt2 + g1dx2 we have an usual behavior g  x  xh near the
horizon located at x = xh. if 2b/b  1, the riemann curvature on this surface is nite. it
is remarkable that both conditions are consistent with each other. thus, if 1
b < 1 or,

(12)

we have a black hole with the riemann curvature nite everywhere including the horizon.

this inequality is not satised by t = t0 when, as is well known, a horizon is regular (the

usual hartle-hawking state). however, there is no contradiction here since at t = t0 the

coecient b = 0 and asymptotic behavior of such a solution [7], [9] has nothing to do with

(11). thus, according to (12), the hartle-hawking state is not included in the set of states

5

under discussion and there are two possibilities to have the horizon with a nite curvature

which cannot match continuously: t = t0 (the isolated point) or t obeys the inequality

(12) (the whole range of temperatures).

in the particular case of the rst model b = , so (12) is reduced, according to (8), to

the condition

0 < t 

t02

(13)

eq.

the case t = 0 is now trivial since for solutions under discussion c = 0 according to (9),
(8) gives us e2 +  = e2y  y and, with the condition of asymptotical atness
() = , we have a linear dilaton vacuum solution  = y with a at spacetime.
therefore, for the rst model a horizon with a nite curvature may exist only at nonzero

temperature. however, for a generic  < b  2 it is possible for such a horizon to exist
even at t = 0.

the case t = 0 is tractable for more detailed investigation. let us consider the example

f = e2()  ()

(14)

then, taking into account that for this model the quantity c  depends on temperature
according to c  = c0(0)  c0(t ), so c  = 0 at t = 0, we nd from (8) the solution
y = (). let us choose, for instance,

 =  

1
2

ln(1 + e2)

(15)

then g = (1 + e2)1. after simple calculations we nd the riemann curvature r =
4(1  g)(g  2)3. at the horizon  = , g = 0 the curvature remains nite in spite of
quantum stresses diverge there. for instance, t y(p l)

24 (1 + 1

2e2)2g1.

y

=  2

thus, we arrive at a rather surprising conclusion: spacetimes with a nite curvature at

the horizon may exist at a temperature dierent from the hawking one and, moreover, their

temperature may be equal to zero! this conclusion is the main result of the present paper.

what is the physical reason for such an unusual behavior? it is instructive to look

at elds equations t (0)

result of mutual compensation of these divergences. meanwhile, the usual proof of the fact

that t = th relies strongly upon the regularity of the stress-energy tensor of quantum eld

at the horizon. the corresponding criteria [5] appeal to the behavior of t (p l)



but do not

take into account properties of t (0)



, i.e. they were considered in isolation from the dynamic

contents of the theory whose solution a given metric represents. usually, such an approach

is justied since a classical part of eld equation is regular, as was tacitly assumed in [5],

but the present case is exceptional in that either quantum or classical contributions to eld

equations diverge near the horizon.

thus, the curvature may be nite everywhere even when the stress-energy tensor describ-

ing the back reaction of quantum elds diverges on the horizon. the situation is sharply

contrasted with that in general relativity where the stress-energy tensor singular at a hori-

zon is inconsistent with the regularity of a metric and of the einstein tensor. the reason

consists in that now we have, apart from a metric, one more classical eld - the dilaton one

coupled to a metric. gradients of this eld compensate the divergencies due to back reaction

of quantum elds.

it can be readily seen from the above formulas that the proper distance between the
 dyg is nite. therefore, the spacetime region
outside the horizon is geodesically incomplete. the dilaton eld  cannot be continued

horizon and any other point l = r y

further across the horizon since  diverges there. the situation with continuation across

such a surface leads, in general, to complex dilaton values [10]. to avoid complex dilaton

eld, one may try to redene the dilaton eld choosing, say, x() instead of  where x

is a schwarzschild-like coordinate. however, any redenition cannot abolish the fact that

7

the quantity f describing the coupling between the dilaton and curvature diverges at the

horizon. there is more deep reason to believe that any attempts of continuation across the

horizon for our solutions should be rejected. the point is that any observer approaching the

horizon from outside moves along a non-geodesic path and perceives uxes of quantum eld

which become innite at the horizon. therefore, the horizon remains in fact unaccessible.

the surface  =  acts as a boundary of spacetime and the usual criteria of geodesic
completeness is physically irrelevant for the solution under discussion. of course, nothing

prevents making a formal analytic continuation of the metric itself but, if the dynamic

contents of the theory (interaction between gravitational, dilaton and quantum scalar elds)

is taken into account, the region inside a horizon seems not to have a physical meaning for

the model in question - at least, if one starts from the outside region. thus, actually the loss

of information inside the horizon is much more severe than in an usual case where at least

an observer brave enough to dive into a black hole can get information about the region

inside the horizon. in fact the notion of an event horizon changes its ordinary meaning since

there are no events inside a horizon at all.

it is seen from (10) that f diverges at the horizon where  =  and so does the total
entropy including the contribution of quantum elds which for exactly solvable models is

proportional (up to a constant) to the horizon value of this function [7]. these divergences

have the same nature as those in the schwarzschild background where entropy of quantum

elds is innite if t 6= th. the dierence between these two situations manifests itself,
however, in that for a black-hole metric in general relativity disparity between two temper-

atures makes a horizon singular and in fact destroys it completely whereas in our case the

horizon remains regular in the sense that the riemann curvature remains nite there.

the features of spacetime discussed above are shared by a whole classes of exactly solvable
models of dilaton gravity for which (i) f () has a simple zero at some 0, (ii) f   at
  , (iii) the constant in the solution is chosen c = c  in accordance with (9). these
features, however, have nothing to do, for example, with the bpp model for which f = e2

8

and the choice c = c  leads to a regular semi-innite throat [2] (generalization to a nite

temperature is considered in [11]). the fact that unusual properties of the solution under

discussion are intimately connected with quantum terms in the action reveals itself in the

eq. (8) and its classical limit directly. indeed, it follows from (8), (10) that in the limit  = 0
the point 0 where f  = 0 moves to 0 = , the coecients b = 0 = c , b   = 0 and
eq. (8) with c = c  turns into f = e2 = e2y whose solution is a linear dilaton vacuum

 = y.

usually, the temperature of hawking radiation in a black hole background is determined

by characteristics of a spacetime (say, an event horizon radius of a schwarzschild hole). the

fact that temperature may be arbitrary actually means that hawking radiation as such is

absent, so we deal with thermal excitation over the boulware state which can be treated

at any temperature. in particular, the choice t = 0 corresponds to the boulware vacuum.

therefore, the type of solution considered in the present paper might shed light to the fate of

a black hole after evaporation, being a candidate on the role of a remnant. this, however,

needs further treatment based on a dynamic scenarios and is beyond the scope of the present

paper.

while usually the notion of singularity implies that it is geometry which exhibits sin-

gular behavior, in our case divergencies manifest themselves in the dynamic characteristics

(components of the stress-energy tensor) and in the coupling between the dilaton led and

curvature. these divergences along with the geodesic incompleteness of the metric in fact

mean that the solution in question is singular in spite of the metric itself is regular - at least,

in the restricted sense: as one approaches the horizon from outside, the riemann curvature

remains nite. so, we have singularity without singularity.

in fact, we are faced with a qualitatively new type of objects in gravitation which occupies

an intermediate place between regular black holes and naked singularities. it is of interest

to elucidate whether coupling between gravitation and dilaton or other classical elds can

produce the same type of solutions in the four-dimensional case.
