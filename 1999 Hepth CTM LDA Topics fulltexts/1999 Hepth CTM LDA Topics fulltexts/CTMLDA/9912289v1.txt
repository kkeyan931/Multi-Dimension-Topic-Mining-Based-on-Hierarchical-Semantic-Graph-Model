abstract

we present a special constraint structure that possesses both red-
ucable and chain structure. using our constraint structure, we show
that the number of required gauge xing conditions is just equal to
the number of chains and the remaining requirements follow from con-
sistency conditions. electrodynamics and yang-mills theories are dis-
cussed as examples.

1 introduction

gauge xing is a familiar concept to physicists who work on gauge theo-
ries. it is well known that the rst class constraints are generators of gauge
transformations of phase space coordinates [1]. let denote by (q, p),  =
1, . . . , m, the set of all primary and secondary rst class constraints of the
system. gauge orbits are dened as submanifolds of physically equivalent
points on the constraint surface that transform into each other under gauge
transformations. to x the gauge, one should take intersections of gauge
orbits by imposing additional conditions on phase space coordinates [2], say

(q, p) = 0

 = 1, . . . , m.

(1)

the set of functions  are called gauge xing conditions, abbreviated as
gfcs. these, together with constraints themselves, dene the physical sub-
space of the theory, denoted by reduced phase space. on the reduced phase
space there exist just nontrivial gauge invariant quantities, i.e. quantities
that does not vanish on the constraint surface, and have vanishing poisson
brackets with constraints.

without xing the gauge one is able to quantize a theory by imposing

supplementary conditions on physical states:

(q, p)|phys >= 0

 = 1, . . . , m

(2)

where (q, p)s are quantum operators corresponding to constraints. how-
ever, most of the times the physicists prefer not to handle the additional
gauged coordinates through the quantum theory. moreover, having insight
to the reduced phase space, its dimension and its geometrical structure helps
one for better understanding the physical content of the theory. in order to
x the gauge, the following conditions are necessary:

i) the set of constraints should be irreducible. that is, the matrix

 

qi

,



pj !

(3)

should have maximal rank m, where m is the total number of rst class
constraints. the reason for this condition is that one should be able to
distinguish independent directions on a gauge orbit. for example px, py, and

1

px + py may be three reducible constraints generating variations in x and y.
to x the gauge, it is legitimate to impose x = c1 and y = c2. obviously
additional condition x + y = c3 due to gauge generator px + py may lead to
a contradiction.

the problem of irreducibility of constraints is highly related to the method
one uses to construct the constraint structure through consistency conditions.
in section (2) we will show that in some methods the resulted constraints may
not necessarily be irreducible.

ii) the gfcs should completely x the gauge. as will be discussed in
more details, this goal would be achieved if the determinant of the matrix
formed by poisson brackets of s and s does not vanish, i.e.

det{, } 6= 0.

(4)

iii) the gfcs (q, p) = 0 should be valid during the time. so their
consistency implies that  = {, h}  0. this may lead to additional
conditions that over-determines the system.

the condition (ii) above, is well known [2, 3]. however, the condition (iii),
although considered in the context of denite models such as electrodynamics
[2], has attracted little attention in the literature.

our main idea in this paper is that satisfying conditions (i-iii) requires a
special treatment in constructing the constraints of the system at one hand,
and proposing the gfcs on the other hand. it seems that the best way to
this goal is proposing a smaller number of gfcs in such a way that their
consistency lead, in a consistent way, to the remaining required conditions
for completely gauge xing. our idea in this regard is to use the chain
structure in the constrained system. by this, we mean that the consistency
of each constraint gives the next constraint in the corresponding chain. this
expectation, however, contradicts with the irreducibility condition of the
constraints, as will be stated later. this diculty has been overcome by
proposing a special procedure of constructing the constraint structure that
has not been considered so far. this procedure is explained in section (2)
and compared with other methods as well.

in section (3) we review the main concepts of gauge symmetry in extended
and total formalisms. our objection is to nd precisely the gauged degrees
of freedom to see how one should x them.

our gauge xing method in a general gauge system is presented in section
(4), where we propose a set of gfcs that correspond to the last elements

2

of the chains. then their consistency conditions automatically gives other
conditions needed to x the gauge completely. in section (5) we study the
electrodynamics and yang-mills theories as two physical examples. we show
that our method works well for xing the gauges in these theories. some
concluding remarks are presented in section (6).

2 constraint structure

as is well known [8] the euler-lagrange equation of motion for a singular
lagrangian is equivalent to hamiltonian-dirac equations:

qi = +

+ va a
1
pi
 va a
1
qi

hc
pi
hc
qi
a(q, p) = 0

pi = 

i = 1, . . . , n

i = 1, . . . , n

a = 1, . . . , m

(5)

where hc is the canonical hamiltonian, a
1s are primary constraints, and as
are the corresponding lagrange multipliers. for convenience, we consider a
purely rst class system. this means that the consistency conditions on
primary, as well as secondary, constraints do not determine the lagrange
multipliers va. so, they remain as arbitrary functions of time in the equations
of motion. the equations 5 can also be derived by varying the action

st = z ( qipi  hc  vaa

1)dt

(6)

with respect to the canonical variables (q, p) and lagrange multipliers ua.
dening the total hamiltonian ht as

the equations of motion for arbitrary function g(q, p) can be written as

ht = hc + vaa
1,

g = {g, ht }.

(7)

(8)

to nd the secondary constraints through the consistency condition of pri-
mary constraints, two methods are used so far. in the rst method, intro-
duced in [3, 4], after a slight change of notation a
1  a1, a1 = 1, . . . , m, one

3

uses 8 for primary constraints. recalling {a1, b1}  0, the consistency of
primary constraints reads

a1  {a1, hc}  0

(9)

suppose the set of functions 9 reduce on the surface a1 = 0 to combinations
of independent functions a2, a2 = 1, . . . , m2(m2  m), such that

{a1, hc} = v a1

a2 a2 + v a1

b1 b1

(10)

where the matrix of coecients v a1
is of maximal rank m2. the set of
a2
constraints a2 can be regarded as second level constraints. one can proceed
in the same way to nd the third level constraints a3, a3 = 1, . . . , m3(m3 
m2), and so on. at the nth level one can write

{an, hc} =

v as1
as

as.

n+1

xs=1

the constraint structure ends up nally at a level n, such that

{an , hc} =

v as1
as

as.

n

xs=1

(11)

(12)

this algorithm of constructing the constraints has the advantage that all
the ass are independent functions of phase space coordinates. however,
as compared with the other methods, this system of constraints, although
having level structure, does not possess the chain structure.

in the second method, used in [5, 6, 7], the second level constraints are

dened as

a
(2)  {a

1, hc},

a = 1, . . . , m.

(13)

even if a
(2)s are not necessarily independent functions of (q, p), one insists
on keeping them in the same form as they emerge from the denition 13.
the purpose is to save the chain structure in the subsequent steps, i. e.

a
(n)  {a

(n1), hc}.

(14)

at the nal level n the poisson bracket of all the constraints a
vanishes weakly (i.e. on the constraint surface), so

(n ) with hc

{a

(n ), hc} =

m

n

xb=1

xn=1

4

f ab
n b

(n).

(15)

there is apparently a large number of additional constraints in this algorithm.
in other words, the constraints are reducible. 3 this is, however, the price
one pays to keep the chain structure in the constrained system.

now, we want to present a third method that has both the advantages of
chain structure and irreducibility of the constraints. for this reason, we rst
consider just the primary constraint 1
1 with a = 1),
and dene

1 (i.e. the constraint a

assuming that 1

(17)

suppose the rst chain terminates after n1 levels of consistency. this means
that {1

constraints 1

{1

n1, hc} =

n1

xn=1

an

(18)

more generally, by weak equality  throughout the paper we mean equality
on the surface of the constraints known up to that point. then the constraints
of the second chain are produced in the same way; then the third chain, and
so on.
in other words, the constraint chains are knitted one by one (not
simultaneously). for a generic constraint a

n we have

a
n  {a

n1, hc}.

(19)

weakly vanishing of the terminating element of the chain a with hc can
be written as follows:

{a

na, hc} = xaa

na

xn=1

n + xa>a

(20)

3in the algorithm given above, constraint chains have the same length. this method
is used in [5]. most of the time constraint chains are considered to have dierent lengths.
although the number of additional constraints decrease in this way, the constraints may
still be reducible.

we denote the coecients aan
coecients.

a (q, p) and ba

a(q, p) as constraint structure

the constraints in this structure are, by their construction, independent
functions of variables (q, p). that is because, if the constraint a
n can be
written as a combination of the previous constraints, then a
n1 should have
been the terminating element of the chain a. so, at each step one encoun-
ters an independent function of phase space coordinates; and the system of
constraints will be completely irreducible after all. the only price that we
have paid to keep the irreducibility and chain structure, is losing the concept
of level, since we do not knit the chains simultaneously, as in the second
method. however, as we will see, this constraint structure is much more
powerful in the process of gauge xing.

3 gauge transformations

gauge transformations are dened as transformations on phase space trajec-
tories and lagrange multipliers

q(t)  q(t) + q(t)
p(t)  p(t) + p(t)
u(t)  u(t) + u(t)

(21)

that include arbitrary functions of time and maintain the action st invariant:

st = 0.

(22)

it can be shown that [10] such transformations also transform a solution of
equations of motion into other solution. the main reason for this, is that the
dynamical equation 8 contains arbitrary functions of time va(t), so dierent
choices of them lead to dierent solutions for qi(t) and pi(t). suppose the
gauge transformations q(t) and p(t) are derived via the operation of some
gauge generator gt :

q = {q, gt }
p = {p, gt }.

(23)

6

it is well known [7, 8, 10] that the necessary and sucient conditions for gt
to generate gauge transformations of st are as follows:

g = fc
g
t
{g, p f c}  pfc

+ {g, hc}  pfc

(24)

where by fc we mean rst class and by pfc we mean primary rst class
constraints. finding the explicit form of gt in terms of the constraints of
system is not an easy task and several authors have proceeded to it [5, 7, 9].
following the method given in [7], we can write gt as

gt =

m

xa=1

na

xn=1

c n

a (q, p, t)a

n

(25)

where a
ns are rst class constraints of the system as dened in 19. then
the second condition in 24, lead to the following recursion relation for the
coecients c n

a s:

c n1

a +

c n
a
t

+ {c n

a , hc} + xaa

c na

a aan

a = 0

(26)

finding the solutions of equations 26 is not our task here. (we do not
care about the third condition in 24, too). our main point is, however,
that if one takes the coecients c na
as arbitrary innitesimal functions of
time a(t), then from the recursion relation 26 it is obvious that the set of
coecients c n

a principally have the following form:

a

= c na1

a

(, )

a = a(t)

a

c na
c na1
...
c 1

a = c 1

a(, , . . . , na1).

as an enlightening example consider the lagrangian

l = x z + xy.

there is one primary constraint 1 = py, and the total hamiltonian is:

ht = pxpz  xy + vpy.

7

(27)

(28)

(29)

the consistency conditions give the constraint chain:

1 = py,

2 = x,

3 = pz

(30)

following the algorithm given in [5] the gauge generator can be written as

gt = py  x + pz

(31)

on the constraint surface n = 0, n = 1, 2, 3 the coordinates are y, px and
z. under the action of gt these coordinates transform as follows

y = ,

px = ,

z = .

(32)

transformations 32 together with v = d3/dt3 leave the action st invariant.
although y, px and z are altogether gauged coordinates of the constraint
surface, they should obey the dynamical equations

px = y,

z = px.

(33)

before proceeding to the important problem of gauge xing, that is our
main interest, it is worth to say some words about the extended formalism.
instead of going through the dicult procedure of determining the generator
of gauge symmetries of st , one can consider the extended action

se = z ( qipi  hc  u)dt

(34)

where the s are the set of all primary and secondary rst class constraints
of the system. the dynamical equations of motion resulting from se can be
written as

where the extended hamiltonian he is

g  {g, he}

he = hc + v.

(35)

(36)

even though the dynamics resulting from he is not equivalent to the true
dynamics of ht , one can see that the equations of motion 35 for gauge
invariant quantities are equivalent to what follows from ht . for instance in
our given example, the extended hamiltonian is

he = pxpz  xy + v1py + v2x + v3pz.

(37)

8

none of the coordinates y, px and z is gauge invariant. so using the extended
hamiltonian, their dynamics is completely arbitrary, i.e. no longer the re-
strictions 33 hold. compared with st , the extended action se has a larger
class of gauge symmetries. it is easy to see that the gauge generator in this
case is:

in other words se is invariant under

ge = x

(t).

qi = {qi, ge}
pi = {pi, ge}
u =  + uw 

  v 
 .

(38)

(39)

where w 

 s and v 

 s are constraint structure coecients dened by:

{, } = w 
 
 .
{h, } = v 

the number of arbitrary functions of time (t), as well as the number of
lagrange multipliers u, are equal to the total number of primary and sec-
ondary constraints of the system. while the number of arbitrary functions of
time a(t) in st is just equal to the number of primary rst class constraints.
however, one obtains the gauge symmetries of the total action st , provided
that one xes, to some extent, the gauges in the extended formalism. to this
end, one demands that v = 0 when  refers to secondary constraints, and
consequently the corresponding v should vanish. this conditions recover
recursion relations among the arbitrary functions (t), that are equivalent
to recursion relation 26. a detailed discussion on this subject can be found
in chapter 3 of [3]. this procedure may be understood easily in our given
example.

4 gauge xing

in this section we rst consider gauge xing in the extended formalism and
then proceed to the gauge xing of the total action. in the extended for-
malism, all the constraints (q, p) are, on the same footing, generators of
gauge transformations of a number of coordinates that we call them gauged

9

coordinates. these coordinates are free to take any value via the gauge trans-
formations 39. to x the gauge, one should impose the gfcs

(q, p) = 0

(40)

in such a way that the gauged coordinates be completely determined on
the surface  = 0. fixing the gauge, just physical (i.e. gauge invariant)
coordinates remain to be determined through the dynamics of the system.
these coordinates dene ultimately the reduced phase space. the gfcs
should be equal in umber and somehow conjugate to the constraints s.
this goal can be achieved if

det{(q, p), (q, p)} 6= 0.

(41)

in other words, the whole set of constraints and gfcs can serve as a set
of second class constraints. as is well known [1], the consistency conditions
of second class constraints lead to determination of a number of lagrange
multipliers. indeed, the consistency of s from 35 gives:

 = {, hc} + v{, }  0.

(42)

determination of all lagrange multipliers v from 42 is guaranteed by 41.
the assertion that 41 is the necessary and sucient condition to x the gauge
by 40, can be proved by demanding that vanishing of the gauge variations
of s, i.e.

should completely kill the arbitrary functions (t).

{, he} = x (t){, } = 0,

(43)

the situation here is, however, dierent for the total action formalism, in
which the condition 41 is no longer sucient to x the gauge. to see this
better, let us go back to our previous example, given by lagrangian 28 and
change it to

l = x z + xy +

( q2  q2).

(44)

1
2

as in 37, the extended hamiltonian reads:

he = pxpz  xy +

1
2

(p2 + q2) + v1py + v2x + v3pz.

(45)

10

one can easily check that the gfcs

1 = y,

2 = px + q,

3 = z

satisfy 41. then from 42, the lagrange multipliers are determined as:

v1 = 0,

v2 = y + p,

v3 = px.

(46)

(47)

to this end, it should be noted that the reduced phase space has only two
coordinates q and p.

the total hamiltonian for this problem is

ht = pxpz  xy +

1
2

(p2 + q2) + vpy.

if one chooses the gauge 46, then its consistency gives:

v  0
y + p  0
px  0.

(48)

(49)

since there exists just one lagrange multiplier v to be determined, the con-
ditions 49 together with gfcs  = 0 (in 46) results to q = 0 and p = 0.
this is really over-determination of the system. on the other hand, if one
chooses just one gfc, say, 3 = z + q (which has non-vanishing poisson
bracket with the last element of the constraint chain), then its consistency
give 2 = px + p and 1 = y  q. consistency of 1, determines nally the
lagrange multiplier: v = p. in this way one xes the gauge in a consistent
way.

suppose one has chosen, at the rst step, the gfc  = y. although
the lagrange multiplier is determined, using   0, as v = 0, it is not a
consistent gauge at all. that is because, the gauge is not completely xed
since 2 = x and 3 = z are still generators of gauge transformations. this
can be seen in another way by considering the gauge generator 31 and the
corresponding gauge variations:

y = ,

px = ,

z = .

as is apparent, if one xes the gauge by demanding y = 0, it does not imply
vanishing of px and z. contrarily, if one demands that z vanish, then px

11

and y will automatically vanish. the lesson we learn from this example
is that the gauge xing process should begin from the bottom of the chain.
in other words, as the rst gfc, one should choose, some function that is
conjugate, to the last element of the chain (i.e. has non-vanishing poisson
bracket with it). then its consistency will give automatically the remaining
gfcs, and nally will determine the corresponding lagrange multiplier in
a consistent way.

before proving this assertion for the general case, using the above exam-
ple, one point should be added. suppose the rst gfc has been chosen as
3 = z + px. then one would get 2 = px  y, and the lagrange multiplier
would have been derived in the next step as v = y. as is apparent, there
would be two gfcs for three gauge generators, so the gauge would not be
xed completely. in other words, by demanding that the gauge variation 32
of 3 and 2 vanish, one obtains:

3 =  +  = 0
2 =  +  = 0.

this condition(s) does not destroy the gauge freedom. therefore we deduce
that if we want to nd as many gfcs as there exist gauge generators (rst
class constraints) the gfcs we begin with should have non-vanishing poisson
brackets just with the last elements of the chains.

now let us consider a generic model with m primary constraints and

consequently m constraint chains as shown schematically below:

. . . m
1
...
m
nm

1
1
...

...
1
n1

2
1
...

. . . a
1
...

2
n2

...

a
na

(50)

we demand that the rst m gauge xing conditions, a
property:

na, have the following

{a

na, b

n}  a(q, p)abn,na

(51)

where a(q, p) can be chosen arbitrarily. suppose one has found a
the above property. since {a

nas with
1}  0 from 51, one obtains, using the

na, b

12

consistency of a

nas, the next generation of gfcs as:

a

na1  {a

na, hc}  0.

let us consider the poisson bracket of a

na1 with the constraints:

{a

na1, b

n} = {{a

na1, hc}, b
c}

= {h, {b

n, a

na}}  {a

na, b

n+1}

(52)

(53)

where we have used 19 in the last line. using 51, the above expression
vanishes for a 6= b, as well as for a = b and n < na  1. note specially that
the poisson brackets of a
na1 with the primary constraints vanishes. for
a = b and n = na  1, however, 53 gives:

{a

na1, a

na1}  a(q, p)

(54)

consistency of a
terms for the gfcs are related to each other as follows:

na1 leads to a

na2  {a

na1, hc} and so on. the generic

a

n = {a

n+1, hc},

n = 1, . . . , na  1

(55)

comparing 55 with 19 shows that the chains of gfcs are exactly the
mirror image of constraint chains; notably they are knitted in the opposite
direction. the whole story goes on as follows: one begins with a
1, goes
through consistency conditions until reaches a
na, then xes the gauge by
nding a
na, turns all the way round through consistency
conditions to reach a
1 at the end point. the story sounds more interesting
by repeating the manipulations in 53 to get:

na conjugate to a

{a
{a
{a

n, b
n, a
n, a

n}  0
n}  0
n}  (1)nana(q, p)

a 6= b
n < n

(56)

as is observed, each a
when one investigates the consistency of a
are determined due to non-vanishing poisson brackets

n is really conjugate to its partner a

n. the story ends
1s, where the lagrange multipliers

{a

1, a

1} = (1)na1a(q, p).

13

considering the matrix of poisson brackets of constraints with gfcs, an-
other interesting feature of the method emerges. according to 56, one can
write:

(57)

where ea = (1)na1. the determinant of matrix 57 is proportional to

qa[a(q, p)]na and apparently is dierent from zero. each non-vanishing

block in the matrix above corresponds to a denite constraint chain. there
emerge, indeed, some non-vanishing elements below the diameter(coming
from {a
n} with n > n). this, however, does not change the situation
dramatically. on the other hand the most advantage of the matrix 57 is
that one can easily nd its inverse, to be used in writing the dirac brackets.

5 electrodynamics with source and yang-mills

as a rst example of applying the method, let us consider electrodynamics
with bosonic source, given by the lagrangian:

l = z d3x{

ff

2

where v () is a potential and

|( + iga)|2  v()}

(58)

f = a  a.

(59)

14

rewriting l in terms of the dynamical elds a(x, t), (x, t) and (x, t),
where

the canonical momenta are

(x, t) = (x, t)ei(x,t),

 = f 0,

 = ,

 = 2(  + ga0).

(60)

(61)

it is obvious from 59 that 1 = 0 is our primary constraint. then, the
total hamiltonian can be written as
 + 1

  ga0

ht = r d3x{hed + 1

2(k)(k) + g2ak(k + 1

where v(x, t) is the lagrange multiplier (eld) and

hed =

1
2

ii +

1
4

fijfij  a0ii.

(63)

we have ignored a surface term in 63 due to boundary conditions. the
secondary constraint serves as

2 = {0, ht } = ii + g.

(64)

no further constraints emerges since {2, ht } = 0. there is just one con-
straint chain with two elements.

to x the gauge in ht formalism, one should begin with 2 conjugate
to 2. a simple choice can be 2 = iai. consistency condition of 2 then
gives automatically the gfcs as

1 = {2, hc} = ii + iia0.

(65)

using 64 one has ii  g, hence from 65 the scalar potential a0 is
determined in this gauge to be

a0(x, t) = z d3y

g(y, t)
|x  y|

one important point to be noted is that if one has imposed the famous
gauge 2 = iai and 1 = a0, then the consistency conditions would lead
to over-determination of the system as  = 0.

if, on the other hand, one has used the extended formalism, then the

extended hamiltonian would be

he = hc +z d3x{v1(x, t)0(x, t) + v2(x, t)[ii(x, t) + g(x, t)]}

(67)

in this case, however, the gauge 2 = iai and 1 = a0 is allowed and its
consistency leads to determination of lagrange multipliers as

v1(x, t) = 0,

v2(x, t) = z d3x

ii(y, t)
|x  y|

.

as a second example, consider pure yang-mills theory given by:

l = 

1

4 z d3xtr(ff )

where

f  = a  a + ig[, ]

the dynamical elds aa

(x, t) are implemented in

a = 

aa

where as are generators of a lie algebra with structure constants c c

ab:

[a, b] = ic ab

c c.

writing the lagrangian 69 in details, the canonical momenta are derived as
a
0 serves as the set of primary constraints. the

where a surface term is ignored. the total hamiltonian is as follows:

ht = hc +z d3xva(x, t)a

0(x, t).

(73)

(74)

the secondary constraints follow from the consistency of primary constraints
as:

a
2(x, t) = {a

as in electrodynamics, one may choose the rst set of gfcs as

a

2 = iaa

i  0.

consistency of this gauge leads to

where

then the solution of 77 can be written as

we observe again that the famous gauge aa

determine the system with imposing the additional condition h a(x, t)  0.

6 concluding remarks

a gauge theory can be viewed either in the extended formalism or in the
total hamiltonian formalism. in the former, all the rst class constraints have
similar contributions in generator of the gauge transformations. so, to x the
gauge, one needs to nd as many gfcs as there exist rst class constraints.
the only condition that should be considered is that the determinant of the
matrix formed by poisson brackets of gfcs with constraints should not
vanish (see 41). two diculties may appear in this method. first, the
number of gfcs may be too large. second, the matrix of poisson brackets
of constraints with gfcs has not any peculiar form, and in the general case
one may have diculties in inverting it to obtain dirac brackets.

in total hamiltonian formalism, on the other hand, primary and sec-
ondary constraints play dierent roles. in other words, the detailed algebra
of constraints with canonical hamiltonian should be noticed.
in this case

consistency of gfcs may lead to additional vanishing functions that may
over-determine the system. while, in the extended formalism the consistency
of gfcs just determines the lagrange multipliers.

we found that if we construct the system of constraints in such a way
that both irredusibility and chain structure are taken into account, then the
consistency of gfcs provides a powerful tool to nd them in a simple and
consistent way. to do this, we begin with gfcs that are conjugate to the
last elements of constraint chains. then, their consistency will automatically
give the reminder of gfcs at one hand, and determines the lagrange multi-
pliers corresponding to primary constraints (in the total hamiltonian), at the
other hand. to construct the system of constraints with both irreducibil-
ity and chain structure properties, we knit the rst chain by investigating
the consistency condition of the rst primary constraint and its secondary
constraints. then we do the same thing for the next primary constraint, and
so on. as far as we know, this system of constraints, that is the main clue
of our gauge xing method, has not been used so far.

the rst advantage of this method is that the number of gfcs to be
found is much smaller than before: just equal to the number of chains, i.e.
number of primary constraints. next, as we see in 57, the matrix of poisson
brackets of gfcs with constraints has a very simple form: it is block diagonal
and in each block is lower triangular. this provides the best situation to
invert it and nd the dirac brackets afterward. it seems that the reduced
phase space has consequently the least deviation from a poisson structure.
we think that this advantage may have clear consequences when applied to
denite gauge theories.

finally, it is notable that this method can also be used within the ex-
tended formalism. although one is not worried about the consistency of
gfcs in the extended formalism, both advantages mentioned above, makes
the method noticeable in this case too.
