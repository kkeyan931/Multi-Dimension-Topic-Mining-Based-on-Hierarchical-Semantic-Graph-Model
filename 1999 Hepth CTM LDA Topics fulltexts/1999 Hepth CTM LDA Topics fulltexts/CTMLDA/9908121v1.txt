abstract

we consider non-bps d8 (and d7) branes in type 0 open string theory
and describe under which circumstances these branes are stable. we nd
stable non-bps d7 and d8 in type 0 with and without d9-branes in the
background. by extending the descent relations between d-branes to type 0
theories, the non-bps d8-brane is considered as the result of a tachyon con-
densation of a d9 anti-d9 pair in type 0. we study the condensation of the
open string tachyons in type 0 with generic gauge groups giving rise to dif-
ferent congurations involving non-bps d8-branes and discuss the stability
in each case. the results agree with the topological analysis of the vacuum
manifold of the tachyon potential for each case.

introduction

in the past year there has been a tremendous increase in our knowledge about non-
bps states and non-bps branes in string theory [1, 2, 3]. we have learnt that only
under certain circumstances these branes can be stable. this fact has been used in
order to extend the duality checks to the non-bps part of spectrum of the string
theories [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. these developments nd a natural implementation in the
context of non-supersymmetric strings, where the lack of spacetime supersymmetry
forces one to nd other stability conditions for the solitons of the theory, which allow
one to establish duality relations to some extent [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. moreover,
there are indications that non-supersymmetric strings might nd their place in the
unication picture of m-theory [12]. it is then natural to try to check these dualities
by means of stable non-bps states in the non-supersymmetric theory1. thus it is
interesting to nd stable non-bps states and in particular stable non-bps d-branes
in non-supersymmetric string theories. progress in this context has been reported
in [14], where a stable d-particle was constructed in type 0 open string theory with
gauge group so(32)  so(32).

in this paper we describe the non-bps d7 and d8 branes of type 0 open string
theory and in particular, we discuss under which circumstances they are stable. we
use the fact that in type 0 theory the background of d9-branes is not completely
determined by the tadpole cancellation, and study the dierent possibilities. this
makes possible to nd that, although non-bps d7 and d8 branes are not stable
in type i [15], they can be stable in type 0. non-bps dp-branes appear in general
as a kink solution in the tachyon potential of a d(p + 1)-brane anti-d(p + 1)-
brane pair [6, 16]. similarly we consider these d8-branes in type 0 as the result of
tachyon condensation of the d9 anti-d9 pairs in type 0 open string theory. more
generally, we analyse the mechanism of tachyon condensation of the d9 anti-d9 pairs
giving rise to non-bps d8-branes for generic type 0 backgrounds with symmetries
so(n)  so(m)  so(n)  so(m), so(n)  so(n)  z2, so(n)  so(n) and
z2  z2. we study the stability in terms of the resulting brane conguration and
using topological arguments; and show that both results agree.

this article is organised as follows. in section 1 we describe the type 0 open
string theory rst considered in [17]. we briey review the tadpole cancellation
with d9-branes, which can give rise to groups of the form so(n)  so(32  n) 
so(n)  so(32 n). we also show how to obtain the same group structure from
an orbifold of type i. in section 2 we show that a non-bps d8+ (d8) brane is
stable if (1) there are only d9 and anti-d9 (d9+ and anti-d9+) branes in the

no xed relation between the mass and the charge.

background or when (2) there are no d9-branes at all in the background. these
results are completely analogous for the non-bps d7-brane. finally, in section 3
we describe the condensation of the open string tachyons between the d9-branes
and anti-d9-branes in type 0 open string theory for dierent generic situations.

1 type 0 open string theory

type 0b (0a) theory is obtained as an orbifold of type iib (iia) by the spacetime
fermion number operator (1)fs [18]. the spectrum of the type 0b (0a) theory
and of most of their open descendants contains double the number of r-r elds
with respect to the type ii case. we denote these two elds as:

(r+, r)  c (p+1) ,

(r, r)  c (p+1) ,

(1.1)

where the upper signs2 correspond to the type 0b with p odd, and the lower signs
correspond to type 0a with p even. we consider the combinations [19]:

c (p+1)



=

1
2

(c (p+1)  c (p+1)) .

(1.2)

consequently, we have two types of dp-branes for each p, that we denote as dp+
and dp, which carry one unit of charge under c (p+1)
, respectively. the
relation between these charges and the charges of the r-r elds in (1.1) is given by

and c (p+1)

q =

(q  q) .

(1.3)

type 0 theory can be obtained as an orientifold of type 0b by  [17], or as an
orbifold by (1)fs of type i [8]. the projection of type i by (1)fs eliminates all
the fermions from the spectrum. the (massless) untwisted sector is given by the
metric, the dilaton, and a r-r 2-form c (2), in the sector (r+, r+). the twisted
sector introduces a tachyon (n s, n s) and a second r-r 2-form c (2) in the sector
(r, r). the orbifold (1)fs has the same eect as a diagonal gso projection.
accordingly, the contribution of the klein bottle to the one-loop vacuum amplitude
only gives rise to a ns-ns massless tadpole in the tree channel, hence the o9 plane
of type 0 carries no r-r charge. there is also an anti-o9 plane which does not carry
any r-r charge either. the ns-ns tadpole does not render the theory necessarily
inconsistent, hence in principle we do not need to introduce d9-branes, so we could
do without an open-string sector in the theory. the ns-ns can in fact be removed

2these signs refer to the worldsheet fermion numbers of the left and right moving sectors, i.e.

the eigenvalues of (1)fl and (1)fr, respectively.

by a fischler-susskind mechanism [20], which introduces a spacetime dependent
coupling.

tadpole cancellation in type 0

the ns-ns tadpole of type 0 can also be cancelled by adding d9-branes, which
introduce an open sector in the theory. since only the cylinder diagram contributes
to a r-r massless tadpole, this must be cancelled by the d9-branes themselves,
hence we have to take an equal number of d9-branes and anti d9-branes. the can-
cellation of the ns-ns tadpole tells us that the number of branes to be introduced
is n = 32:

an sn s = v10z 

0

d
2

(82)(cid:18)1

2

(2n)2e2 + 16(n  32)2(cid:19) .

(1.4)

the exponentially divergent term is a tachyon tadpole, which is expected in a theory
with a tachyon in the closed string spectrum. thus type 0 string theory without
tadpoles can have a gauge group so(32)  so(32).

on the other hand, we know that type 0b contains two types of dp-branes for
each p odd. this implies that we also have two types of d9-branes in the type 0
theory [8, 12]. thus regarding the type 0 theory as a type 0b orientifold, there are
dierent possible combinations of d9-branes which cancel the tadpoles. the generic
case is a system of n d9+ branes and 32  n d9 branes, with their respective
antibranes. this conguration originates the gauge group so(n)  so(32  n) 
so(n)so(32n), and the r-r and ns-ns massless tadpoles vanish. moreover,
the tachyon tadpole is slightly changed:

an sn s = v10z 

0

d (82) (32  2n)2 e2 ,

(1.5)

and vanishes for n = 16. this is the situation where we have 16 d9+ and 16 d9
branes and their respective antibranes, which is equivalent to 16 bound states of
the form d9 plus the corresponding antibranes. the fact that the tachyon tadpole
vanishes3 in this specic conguration is consistent with the fact that the potential
between the d9 bound states is proportional to the potential between type i d9-
branes. one concludes that from the point of view of a type 0b orientifold, type 0
without tadpoles can have in general so(n) so(32 n) so(n) so(32 n)
symmetry.

3although the closed string tachyon does not appear in the cylinder amplitude for n = 16, it

does appear in the torus amplitude.

type 0 as an orbifold of type i

the generic conguration of d9-branes with gauge group so(n)so(32n)
so(n)  so(32  n) can also be made consistent with the orbifold construction
of type 0 from type i4. consider the gauge transformation

i =    l1n

0

0

l132n ! ,

which acts on the chan-paton factors of the open string states as

| . . .i    | . . .i  ii 1 .

(1.6)

(1.7)

the orbifold5 of type i by (1)fs i then yields the type 0 theory with gauge group
so(n)so(32n)so(n)so(32n). this construction goes schematically
as follows. the group element i makes a natural division of the 32 d9-branes of
type i into two sets, one with n branes and the other one with 32  n branes.
accordingly, the chan-paton factors for open strings can be divided as

 =   a b

c d ! ,

(1.8)

where a is an n  n matrix associated to the n d9-branes of the rst set, and
d is a (32  n)  (32  n) matrix associated to the other 32  n d9-branes. b
and c are the chan-paton factors for the open strings stretching from one of the
n branes of the rst set and another one from the second set with 32  n branes.
orbifolding by (1)fs i we eliminate the fermions in the open strings which begin
and end on branes of the same set, and the bosons of the open strings with each
end in a brane of either set. the gauge group so(32) is thus broken down to
so(n)  so(32  n) and we are left with massless fermions in the (n, 32  n)
representation. this implies that the 32 d9-branes become n d9-branes of one
type and 32  n d9-branes of the other one, either d9+ or d9.
the anti d9-branes can be considered as coming from the twisted sector of the
orbifold (1)fs  i. implementing the orbifold projection on this twisted sector we
nd n anti d9-branes of one type and 32 n of the other type. moreover, tadpole
cancellation6 imposes that the n anti d9-branes must be of the same type as the
4this extents the result of [8], where only the so(32) so(32) case was obtained as an orbifold
5this type of projection was used previously in [21] to connect the d3-brane of type iib with

of type i.

the d3 bound state of type 0b.

6one might think that there is an ambiguity in the choice of type of brane in the twisted sector.
however, in a conguration with n d9+ branes, 32  n d9 branes, 32  n anti d9+ branes
and n anti d9 branes, the tachyon tadpole vanishes for any n , but the r-r tadpole would only
vanish for n = 16.

figure 1: type 0 theory. this graphic shows how to construct type 0 theory from type
0b and type i, with a gauge group of the form so(n )so(32n )so(n )so(32n ).
the operator i determines n in the construction from type i. this choice corresponds
in the orientifold case to a certain gauge freedom we have in order to choose the types of
branes cancelling the tadpole.

n d9-branes of the untwisted sector, and similarly for the other 32 n d9-branes.
the operation i does not act on the closed string spectrum. thus after orbifolding
type i by (1)fsi we obtain the same closed spectrum as before. finally, we obtain
the type 0 theory with the group so(n)  so(32  n)  so(n)  so(32  n),
containing both d9+ and d9 branes.

finally, we would like to emphasize that the introduction of the d9-branes
is completely arbitrary, since there is no r-r tadpole to cancel and the ns-ns
tadpole is harmless and can be treated with a fischler-susskind mechanism [20].
accordingly, we can consider a generic type 0 theory with n d9+ branes and m d9
branes, and the corresponding antibranes. the gauge group is so(n)  so(m) 
so(n)  so(m) and there is a ns-ns tadpole unless n + m = 32. in particular,
we can consider type 0 with no d9-branes at all, hence the open sector would be
absent. from now on we will consider these more generic backgrounds for type 0.
the transition from one case to the other with less branes can be seen as produced by
the annihilation of d9 anti-d9 pairs into the vacuum, where the open string tachyon
condenses restoring the vacuum. in section 3 we will propose an alternative tachyon
condensation for which the d9 anti-d9 pair gives rise to a non-bps d8-brane. we
proceed now with the description of this non-bps d8-brane.

2 stable d8-brane in type 0

using the descent relations between d-branes in type ii theories [22, 2], one can
construct a non-bps d(2p)-brane in type iib theory. this can be obtained either
from a d(2p + 1) anti-d(2p + 1) pair in type iib, or from a d(2p) anti-d(2p) pair

6

of type iia. we can extend these relations to type 0a/0b theories. for instance,
in a d(2p + 1)+ anti-d(2p + 1)+ pair in type 0b there is a non-bps d(2p)+ brane
associated to the tachyonic kink solution. this construction goes through like in
type ii, except for the r-sector which is absent. this non-bps d(2p)+ brane can
also be constructed from a d(2p)+ anti-d(2p)+ pair of type 0a. in order to obtain
this, we argue that the orbifold projection of type 0a (0b) by (1)f s
l yields type
0b (0a), where (1)f s
l is the spacetime fermion-number of the left-movers and acts
with a minus sign on the r-r sectors. in this way we can start with a d8+ anti-d8+
pair in type 0a and by projecting with (1)f s
l we obtain a non-bps d8+-brane in
type 0b, or else, we can construct the non-bps d8+ brane as a kink solution of the
tachyon potential in a d9+ anti-d9+ pair in type 0b. the low-energy eld content
on this non-bps d8+ brane in type 0b is the same as for the non-bps d8-brane of
type iib but without fermions: an u(1) vector, a transversal scalar and a tachyon.
this can also be obtained from the non-bps d8-brane in type iib by projecting
with the orbifold (1)fs.

notice that we can choose between two types of branes, either dp+ or dp. we
can distinguish a non-bps d8+ from a non-bps d8 in type 0b at low energies
by the sign of the coupling to the closed string tachyon. in order to see this we
compare the cylinder amplitude between two non-bps d8+ branes

we factorize the cylinder in the closed string channel, expanding for small t. we
nd

thus we can conclude that they couple with a dierent sign to the closed string
tachyon. notice also that the bound state d8 has a cylinder amplitude propor-
tional to that of a non-bps d8-brane in type iib.

in order to obtain the d8+ brane of type 0 theory we must consider the projection
by  in the d8+ brane of type 0b. from [15] we know that the action of  on the
8-8 strings is the following. for the (1)f ns even part we nd

for the dd direction. thus the u(1) gauge eld is projected out and only the
massless transversal scalar survives. in the (1)f ns odd part we have

|0i = |0i ,

(2.6)

so the tachyon is projected out, and this d8+ brane is in principle stable.

one can also consider a system of n d8+-branes in type 0. however, the world-
volume theory will be given by a non-abelian vector eld and a tachyon in the
adjoint representation of so(n), and a transversal scalar in the symmetric repre-
sentation of so(n). thus a system of n d8+ (d8) branes is in general not stable
in type 0 string theory.

we nd that a single d8+ brane in type 0 is in principle stable, and only contains
a scalar in its worldvolume theory.
in order to complete the analysis we must
consider the open strings which eventually appear stretching between the d8-brane
and the d9-branes. there are several possibilities that we describe next and which
are summarized in table 1.

stable d8-brane in type 0 with d9-branes

in type 0 theory with d9-branes in the background there are also 8-9 open
strings, stretching between the d8+ brane and the d9 and anti-d9 branes. consider
the case of a d8+ brane in the background of 32 d9+ branes and 32 anti-d9+ branes.
there are then 64 tachyons in the spectrum of the 8-9 strings which appear in the
ns-sector, for which

l0

(2.7)

on the physical states. on the other hand, if we have a d8+ brane in the background
of 32 d9 branes and 32 anti-d9 branes, there appear no tachyons in the 8-9
strings since these only contain a r-sector. thus we nd that a single d8+ (d8)
brane is stable in type 0 if there are only d9 (d9+) branes in the background.
if we disregard the ns-ns tadpole, we can have any gauge group of the form
so(n)  so(n).

notice that although in type i the d8-brane is not stable [15], it can be stable
in type 0. in fact, this can also be derived from the non-bps d8-brane of type
i. consider the construction of type 0 from type i with the orbifold (1)fs  i as
explained in section 1, where i is taken to be of the form (1.6). there are tachyons
in the ns-sector of the 8-9 strings in type i, which can be represented by

|0i  a ,

a = 1, . . . 32 ,

(2.8)

where a denotes the chan-paton factor of the 8-9 strings7. the orbifold symmetry
7since the theory is unoriented this sector contains in fact a certain combination of 8-9 and

9-8 strings.

8

has a natural action on these chan-paton factors:

|0i  a  |0i  i a

bb ,

(2.9)

which can be used to project out n of the tachyons. this also keeps 32  n
tachyons, coming from the strings stretching between the d8-brane and 32  n
d9-branes8. in the twisted sector one has 32 anti-d9-branes, which give rise to 32
extra tachyons in the 8-9 sector. finally, one performs again the projection onto
invariant states under the transformation (2.9). as a result we obtain 2(32  n)
tachyons coming from the d8+-d9+ and d8+-anti-d9+ sectors, or similarly, from
the d8-d9 and d8-anti-d9 sectors.
in particular, using this procedure we
obtain a stable d8-brane in type 0 with so(32) so(32) gauge group for the case
i =  l132. thus we nd again that a non-bps d8+ (d8) branes is stable if there
are only d9 (d9+) branes in the background.

stable d8-brane in type 0 without d9-branes

we can make the choice of not introducing any d9-brane at all in type 0. the
resulting theory has no open string sector, contains a tachyon in the closed string
sector and a massless ns-ns tadpole, originated by the o9 and the anti-o9 planes.
in this situation there is no 8-9 open string sector, so that a single d8+ (d8) brane
is stable. moreover, since the spectrum of the open strings stretched between a d8+
and a d8 is in the r-sector (see (2.2)), we can also consider the bound state d8,
which is also stable.

we can perform a similar analysis for a non-bps d7-brane in type 0, using the
results of [15]. we nd a stable non-bps d7+ (d7) brane in type 0 for the same
cases as for the d8+ (d8) brane. we summarize these results in table 1.

3 tachyon condensation in type 0

a generic background of type 0 contains an equal number of d9-branes and anti-d9-
branes. this is in fact a natural setting for the study of tachyon condensation. if
the d9 and anti-d9 branes annihilate into the vacuum, we are left with the o9 and
the anti-o9 planes, which originate a negative tree-level cosmological constant [23].
we can consider instead a tachyon condensation for which a d9 anti-d9 pair gives
rise to a non-bps d8-brane. in this section we consider this type of condensation
and discuss the stability of the resulting congurations. we start with the most
8recall that these 32  n d9-branes are of a dierent type from the other n d9-branes. in
fact, this projection also keeps the r-sector only in the strings stretched between the d8 and the
rst n d9-branes.

considered. we also indicate the gauge group when we have n d9 anti-d9 pairs, with n
arbitrary.

general case of type 0 with symmetry so(n)  so(m)  so(n)  so(m). we also
consider other cases included in this one, which are obtained by letting some of the
d9 anti-d9 pairs to condense into the vacuum.

so(n)  so(m)  so(n)  so(m) symmetry

let us consider type 0 with gauge group so(n)  so(m)  so(n)  so(m),
originated by n d9+ and m d9 branes, and the corresponding antibranes. there
is moreover an extra z2 symmetry corresponding to the exchange d9+  d9.
in this case there are tachyons in the (n, 1, n, 1) and (1, m, 1, m) representations.
consider the condensation of all the d9 anti-d9 pairs of a given type, for instance
d9, into d8-branes. we obtain m non-bps d8 branes in the background of n
d9+ anti-d9+ pairs. although we nd no tachyons in the 8-9 strings, there are
tachyons in the 8-8 strings as shown in section 2, so the system of n d8-branes is
not stable. a similar result is obtained if we let the system condense to m non-bps
d8 branes plus n non-bps d8+ branes.

we can compare this result with the analysis of the symmetries of the tachyon
potential, in a similar fashion as in [24]. the tachyon potential has a so(n) 
so(m)  so(n)  so(m) symmetry, hence the vacuum manifold, sn1  sm1 
sn1sm1, is connected. thus there are no stable kink solutions to this potential.
the system is then expected to decay into the vacuum.

so(n)  so(n)  z2 symmetry

in the above conguration, we can consider the condensation of k, k < m, d9

10

anti-d9 pairs into d8 branes and m k pairs into the vacuum. the result is a set
of k non-bps d8 branes in the background of n d9+ anti-d9+ pairs. this is not
stable since there are tachyons in the 8-9 sector, and for k > 1 there are moreover
tachyons in the 8-8 sector. if the n d9+ anti-d9+ pairs decay into the vacuum,
the result is then a set of k non-bps d8 branes in type 0 without d9-branes.
according to the results of section 2 this is only stable for k = 1.

we compare now with the analysis of the symmetries of the tachyon potential.
the condensation of k d9 anti-d9 pairs into d8 branes and m  k pairs into
the vacuum requires that some of the components of the (1, m, 1, m) tachyon must
condense independently. in order for this to be possible the group associated to the
d9 branes, so(m) so(m), must be broken down to so(m k) so(m k)
so(k) so(k). so the relevant symmetry group in order to seek for kink solutions
is so(n)  so(k)  so(n)  so(k). for k > 1 the vacuum manifold associated to
the tachyon potential is again connected and we nd no stable kinks.

for k = 1, i.e. when we have n d9+ anti-d9+ pairs and just one d9 anti-d9
pair, the symmetry of the tachyon potential is so(n)  so(n)  z2. the vacuum
manifold corresponds to two discrete copies of sn1  sn1. this is not connected
and accepts a topological stable kink solution corresponding9 to a stable non-bps
d8 brane in the background of n d9+ anti-d9+ pairs. if these n pairs decay into
the vacuum, we are left with a single stable non-bps d8.

so(n)  so(n) symmetry

if all the d9 anti-d9 pairs of a given type decay into the vacuum, we are left with
type 0 with a gauge group of the form so(n) so(n). this symmetry is originated
by n d9+ (or d9) branes and the corresponding n antibranes. this theory has a
tachyon in the (n, n) representation. the analysis of this case is similar to the one
above.

if we consider the condensation of k pairs, n  k > 1, we obtain k non-bps
d8+ (d8) branes in the background of n k d9+ anti-d9+ (d9 anti-d9) pairs.
this is not stable since there are tachyons in the 8-8 strings. if the n k d9 anti-d9
pairs do not decay into the vacuum, there are moreover tachyons in the 8-9 strings.
the relevant tachyon potential has so(k) so(k) symmetry, so that the minimum
describes a vacuum manifold of the form sk1  sk1. this manifold is connected
so there is no topological stable kink. the case k = 1 is included in the discussion
below.

9one can also consider the condensation of a higher tachyonic mode of a single d9 anti-d9
pair. this will give rise in general to n + 1 kinks and n (n + 1) anti-kinks, which will correspond to
2n + 1 (2n + 2) non-bps d8-branes. i thank a. sen for drawing my attention to this possibility.

z2  z2 symmetry

a special case is when we let all the d9 anti-d9 pairs condense into the vacuum
except for a pair of each type, i.e. we are left with one d9+ anti-d9+ pair and
one d9 anti-d9 pair. the symmetry so(n)  so(m)  so(n)  so(m) is then
broken down to z2  z2. we have two tachyon elds with a z2 symmetry each.
moreover, there is one extra z2 symmetry corresponding to the exchange d9+ 
d9. let us analyse the possible kink solutions in this potential. one possibility is
that one tachyon condenses into a kink solution and the other condenses into the
vacuum. this gives us two possible kinks, which are indistinguishable because of
the extra z2 symmetry. the result is a stable non-bps d8 brane, either d8+ or
d8, in type 0 without d9-branes. one can of course leave one of the d9 anti-d9
pairs intact. the symmetry of the potential is then z2 and we obtain, after tachyon
condensation, a non-bps d8+ (d8) brane in type 0 with a d9 anti-d9 (d9+
anti-d9+) pair in the background, which is also stable.

another possibility is when both tachyons condense into a kink. notice that
both tachyon elds have dependence on the same compact direction x along the
d9-branes. the position of the zero of the rst tachyon kink along the x-axis is
free to be chosen by reparametrisation invariance. however, the relative position
of the zero of the second tachyon is not. consequently we obtain a 1-parameter
family of kink-pairs, where the parameter indicates the relative distance between
the zeroes of the two kinks. on the other hand, the x-axis becomes the direction
transverse to the non-bps d8-branes after tachyon condensation [6]. thus the
distance-parameter indicates the relative distance between the non-bps d8+ and
the non-bps d8 after tachyon condensation. this means that in the procedure of
tachyon condensation we obtain a stable non-bps d8+ - d8 pair with a relative
separation distance. in particular, when the zeros of both kinks coincide, we obtain
the stable bound state d8.

4 conclusions

we have found stable non-bps d7 and d8 branes in type 0. we have made use of
the fact that the background of d9-branes in type 0 is not completely determined
by the tadpole cancellation, and that we have the freedom of choosing between
two types of d9-branes. moreover, disregarding the ns-ns tadpole, which can
be removed by other means, we can have any number of d9 anti-d9 pairs in the
background. the results are summarized in table 1.

the open string tachyon in the d9 anti-d9 pair can condense to give rise to
the non-bps d8-brane described in this paper. we have analysed the tachyon

12

condensation in type 0 for several generic congurations of d9-branes, and found
that only when there is a z2 symmetry involved the condensation yields a stable
conguration. this corresponds to having only one d9 anti-d9 pair of at least one
type, either d9+ or d9. for the particular case of the z2  z2 symmetry there is
also a freedom to separate the resulting non-bps branes in the procedure of tachyon
condensation.

we notice that in type 0 the ns-ns tadpole can be eliminated either by a
fischler-susskind mechanism, or by adding d9 and anti-d9 branes. the fischler-
susskind mechanism introduces a spacetime-dependent metric and dilaton. on the
other hand, the d9 anti-d9 pairs can give rise to non-bps d8-branes after tachyon
condensation. in general, a background with d8-branes has associated a metric and
a dilaton with non-trivial dependence on the spacetime [25]. it would be interesting
to investigate further the background of type 0 in the presence of these non-bps d8
branes and see whether there is any relation with a fischler-susskind mechanism
in type 0.

finally, type 0 with gauge group so(32) so(32) was conjectured to be s-dual
to the compactication of the 26-dimensional bosonic string on the so(32) weight
lattice [8]. it would be interesting to nd out whether this duality can be extended
to more generic type 0 backgrounds, like those described in this paper. moreover,
it would be very interesting to see to which states correspond the stable non-bps
d7 and d8 branes in the dual theory.
