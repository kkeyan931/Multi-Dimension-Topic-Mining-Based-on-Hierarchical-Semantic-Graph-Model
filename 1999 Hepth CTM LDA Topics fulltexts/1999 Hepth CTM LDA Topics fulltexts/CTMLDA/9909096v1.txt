abstract

we present a generalization of calibrations in which the calibration
form is not closed. we use this to examine a class of supersymmet-
ric p-brane worldvolume solitons.as an example we consider m5-brane
worldvolume solitons in an ads background.

introduction. there has been considerable progress recently in the
classication of p-brane worldvolume solitons. in a at background with
no born-infeld type elds the worldvolume dynamics are governed by the
nambu-goto action

sn g = z dp+1xp det g

(1.1)

where g denotes the pull-back of the background metric to the world-
volume. for such congurations this lagrangian is equal to the energy
density of the p-brane and solutions to the equations of motion minimize
both the volume and the energy.

a large number of solutions have been classied in terms of calibrated
geometries [1],[2],[3],[4]. the solutions are described by calibration forms
dened on the target space, and the brane worldvolumes correspond
to calibrated sub-manifolds of the target space. many examples have
been constructed, and the types of geometry encountered are typically
kahler, special lagrangian and exceptional. the resulting solitons may
be seen to arise from multiple intersections of p-branes which preserve
some proportion of the supersymmetry depending on the geometry of
the contact set. however there are limitations to the methods used here,
they do not allow treatment of congurations with non-vanishing born-
infeld elds and they do not describe solitons in curved backgrounds

whose worldvolume actions are modied by the presence of wess-zumino
terms.

in this article we present a generalization of the concept of a calibrated
geometry which enables us to describe a class of solitons in a curved
background but with vanishing born-infeld elds.
it is necessary to
modify the denition of the calibration form as in a curved background
the energy is not equal to the p-brane volume.

generalized calibrations. let (m, g) be an n-dimensional rieman-
nian manifold with metric g, and x  m . suppose that g(p, tx(m ))
is the grassmannian of (oriented) p-planes in tx(m ). then for  
g(p, tx(m )), there exists an orthonormal basis with respect to g, {e1...en}
of tx(m ) such that {e1...ep} is a basis of . the co-volume of  is then
dened as



 = e1  ...  ep.

(1.2)

for our denition of a generalized calibration (referred to from now on
as simply a calibration), we drop the standard requirement of closure
for the calibration form.

a calibration of degree p on an open subset u  tx(m ) is a p-form 
)  1 for all   g(p, tx(m )). it is also

such that, at each x  u , x(
required that the contact set g() should be non-empty, where



g() = {  g(p, tx(m )) : (

)  1}.



(1.3)

suppose now that n is a p-dimensional submanifold of m . then n is
a calibrated submanifold (or calibration for short) of degree p if



x(

n x) = 1

for all x  n ,where  is a calibration of degree p in t (m ).

n x is the

as we have removed the requirement that d = 0 should hold, it is
not the case generally that n is volume minimizing. however another
quantity is minimized. suppose n is calibrated and u is an open sub-
manifold of n and v is an open sub-manifold of m such that u = v .
then let l be a manifold with oriented boundary l = u  v . we may
then write

z u = z (



u )u = zu

 = zv

where we have used stokes theorem and  denotes the volume form. so
the new minimized quantity is

where b is a manifold whose boundary is n and g is the pull-back of
the metric to n. this quantity is of considerable interest in theories
for which the born-infeld elds vanish, and there is a non-trivial wess-
zumino term; such as p-branes in a curved supergravity background,
which we consider in the next section. for these theories, n is identied
with some spatial submanifold of the worldvolume and b = n .

examples. we consider worldvolume solitons on a m5-brane in the
background of a stack of parallel m5-branes in the near horizon limit,
so the background metric and 4-form are given by

ds2 =

ds2(e

5,1) +

r2
r2 (dr2 + r2ds2(s 4))
g4 = s 4.

r is a positive constant and the above geometry is ads7  s 4. we work
in the static gauge and consider solutions which depend only on the
5  q worldvolume co-ordinates {xi : i = 1, . . . , 5  q}. the worldvolume
action may then be written as

s = (cid:18)z d5qxqdet(gij) z f(cid:19)

for constant  and

gij = (cid:18) r

the ya are the transverse scalars. we remark that by adopting an anzatz
in which we set y5 = 0 we may set the pull-back of the background 3-
form to the m5-brane worldvolume to zero so the eective worldvolume
action is indeed (1.9). we therefore consider solitons with 2,3 or 4 active
transverse scalars.

the denition of the calibration forms proceeds in exactly the same
manner as for the at computations with the co-ordinate basis replaced
by an orthonormal basis dened with respect to g. thus for example the
su (4) kahler calibration generalizes to a su (4) hermitian calibration
again preserving 1

r3 dx1 dx2 dx3 dx4 +dx1 dx2 dy1 dy2 +dx3 dx4 dy1 dy2.

it is required that x 1 + ix 2 and x 3 + ix 4 should be holomorphic func-
tions of x1+ix2 and x3+ix4. more interesting examples may be obtained

by considering generalizations of special lagrangian and exceptional ge-
ometries [5]. in all cases it is straightforward to verify that d = f so
that the equations of motion are satised. all of the examples in this
background are supersymmetric, i.e.

 =

and  is a killing spinor [6].
it has been shown that just as for the
at background the calibration form may be constructed from these
killing spinors satisfying appropriate constraints [7]. moreover the rela-
tion d = f may be seen to arise as a consequence of the supersymmetry
algebra.

the methods outlined here may be applied to p-brane congurations
in a large number of backgrounds for which the born-infeld type elds
vanish. in addition, an extension of this treatment has been presented
in [8] which includes these elds.
