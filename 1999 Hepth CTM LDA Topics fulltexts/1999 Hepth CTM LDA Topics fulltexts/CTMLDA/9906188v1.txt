abstract

we show that the logarithmic behaviour seen in perturbative and non perturba-
tive contributions to green functions of gauge-invariant composite operators in n =4
sym with su (n ) gauge group can be consistently interpreted in terms of anoma-
lous dimensions of unprotected operators in long multiplets of the superconformal
group su (2, 2|4).
in order to illustrate the point we analyse the short-distance
behaviour of a particularly simple four-point green function of the lowest scalar
components of the n =4 supercurrent multiplet. assuming the validity of the oper-
ator product expansion, we are able to reproduce the known value of the one-loop
anomalous dimension of the single-trace operators in the konishi supermultiplet.
we also show that it does not receive any non-perturbative contribution from the
one-instanton sector. we briey comment on double- and multi-trace operators and
on the bearing of our results on the ads/scft correspondence.

1 introduction and summary of the results

as is well known, conformal invariance puts tight constraints on the correlation functions
of primary operators [1]. in particular, two- and three-point green functions are xed
up to multiplicative constants. four-point functions in four-dimensional conformal field
theories (cfts), however, are determined by conformal invariance only up to a priori
unknown functions of two independent conformal invariant cross-ratios. as a consequence
the comparison of four-point amplitudes computed in type iib supergravity/superstring
theory in ads5s5 with four-point correlation functions in n =4 super yangmills theory
(sym) represents a truly dynamical and highly non-trivial check of the correspondence
proposed by maldacena [2].

a dynamical check of the maldacena conjecture was indirectly carried out for some
higher-derivative terms in the ads eective action in [3], where even in the case of an
su(2) gauge group the non-perturbative (one-instanton) correction to a sixteen-fermion
green function was shown to precisely match the result of a similar non-perturbative
(one-d-instanton) correction in the ads supergravity theory. a supersymmetry related
four-point function of scalar composite operators belonging to the n =4 supercurrent
multiplet was also explicitly computed. this matching was recently proven to hold for
any number of colours, n, and for any instanton number in the large n limit [4].

a common feature of all four-point green function computations performed so far,
both in the ads description [5, 6, 7, 8] and in n =4 sym theory [9, 10], is the appearance
of short-distance logarithmic singularities.
in this paper we demonstrate that in the
conformal phase of sym theory this behaviour can be explained as a result of the presence
of operators with non-vanishing anomalous dimensions.

indeed only short supermultiplets of the global su(2, 2|4) superconformal symmetry
are protected from receiving quantum corrections to their scale dimensions,  [11]. the
lowest scalar components of a short multiplet belong to a representation of highest weight
[0, , 0] of the su(4) r-symmetry and have scale dimension  = , for some integer
  2 [12]. a familiar example is the n =4 supercurrent multiplet with  = 2, whose ads
counterpart is the gauged supergravity multiplet.
long multiplets on the contrary can exist for any value of the scale dimension of their
lowest component [11]. an example is the konishi supermultiplet [13] that involves single
(colour) trace operators.
in the large n limit the konishi-type supermultiplets, that
correspond to genuine string excitations [11], are expected to receive (large) corrections
to their anomalous dimensions [14, 15].

there exist also multi-trace operators that may belong both to short and to long mul-
tiplets [11]. the former are protected while, as we will show in this paper, the corrections
to the anomalous dimensions of the latter are vanishingly small in the large n limit.

in order to illustrate our point, in this paper we concentrate on the simplest example of
unprotected operator, namely the lowest scalar component of the konishi multiplet, which
has naive scale dimension (0) = 2. we compute both the one-loop and the one-instanton
contributions to a particular four-point function in which this operator is exchanged in
only one of the intermediate channels. assuming the validity of the operator product
expansion (ope), we reproduce the known value of the one-loop anomalous dimension
of the konishi multiplet as a non trivial check of our interpretation of the appearence of

1

short-distance logarithmic singularities. moreover, the analysis of the non-perturbative
contribution demonstrates that both the anomalous dimension of the konishi multiplet
and its trilinear ope coecients with operators in the supercurrent multiplet receive only
perturbative corrections.

the outline of the paper is as follows. after a preliminary discussion on anomalous
dimensions in a generic cft in section 2, in section 3 we identify a simple four-point func-
tion that allows us to most directly expose and interpret the short-distance logarithmic
behaviour in n =4 sym theory. one-loop and one-instanton computations are described
in sections 4 and 5, respectively. section 6 contains our conclusions and comments on the
logarithmic behaviour found in genuine ads computations.

2 anomalous dimensions in conformal field theory

anomalous dimensions usually (e.g. in qcd) appear as a consequence of the need of
regularising and renormalising the theory. at rst sight their appearance might seem
surprising in a theory, such as su(n) n = 4 sym, that is known to be nite [16].
computations performed so far have indeed shown that four-point functions of composite
operators belonging to the supercurrent multiplet are nite at non-coincident points. on
the other hand, even two-point functions of protected operators, that are expected not to
be corrected in perturbation theory nor after inclusion of instanton eects, are not nite
in a distributional sense. in order to make them nite one has to subtract short-distance
non-integrable singularities [17]. this, however, is necessary even in a free theory and has
nothing to do with the non-trivial dynamics of su(n) n =4 sym.
to illustrate in a simple fashion the emergence of logarithmic terms and their relation
to anomalous dimensions, let us consider the two-point function of a primary operator of
scale dimension 

ho

(x)o(y)i =

a

(x  y)2 ,

(1)

where a is an overall normalisation constant possibly depending on the subtraction
scale . now suppose that  = (0) + , i.e. the operator under consideration has an
anomalous dimension. in perturbation theory  = (g) is expected to be small and to
admit an expansion in the coupling constant g. the perturbative expansion of (1) in
powers of  yields

ho

(x)o(y)i =

a

(x  y)2(0) (cid:18)1   log[2(x  y)2] +

1
2

2(log[2(x  y)2])2 + . . .(cid:19) ,

(2)
where after renormalisation we have set a = a2. thus, although the exact expres-
sion (1) is conformally invariant, at each order in  (or in g) (2) contains logarithms that
seem to even violate scale invariance. let us stress that the appearance of logarithmic
terms is an artifact of the perturbative expansion, rather than an intrinsic property of the
theory.

similar considerations apply to generic n-point green functions as well. assuming the

2

validity of the ope, a four-point function can be expanded in the s-channel in the form

hqa(x)qb(y)qc(z)qd(w)i =xk

k(x  y, y)
cab
(x  y)a+bk

ccd

k(z  w, w)

(z  w)c +dk hok(y)ok(w)i ,

(3)
where k runs over a (possibly innite) complete set of primary operators. descendants
are implicitly taken into account by the presence of derivatives in the wilson coecients,
cs. an expansion like (3) is valid in the other two channels as well. to simplify formulae
we assume that qa,qb,qc,qd are protected operators, i.e. they have no anomalous
dimensions. in general the operators ok may have anomalous dimensions, k, so that
k = (0)
k +
k the perturbative correction to the ope coecients. indeed, although
ij
three-point functions of single-trace chiral primaries are known not to be renormalised
beyond tree level [18], a priori nothing can be said concerning corrections to three-point
functions involving also unprotected operators.

k is the tree-level scale dimension. similarly cij

k + k, where (0)

k, with ij

k = c (0)

neglecting descendants, one gets for the rst-order terms of (3) in the small parameters

 and

from this perturbative formula one can extract the corrections to both the ope coe-
cients and the anomalous dimensions of the operators ok. the former come from the
terms in (4) that display the same singularities as dictated by naive dimensional analysis,
the latter from the coecients of the logarithmic terms.

we end this section with a general remark on anomalous dimensions. positivity of
two point-functions in the distributional sense implies lower bounds on the anomalous
dimension of the operators. in particular, scale dimensions of rank r symmetric tensors
have to satisfy   2 + r [19]. for a scalar eld the bound is   1, which is obviously
saturated by a free eld. if, however, the scalar eld belongs to a supermultiplet that
also contains some tensor eld, there are additional constraints coming from the relation
imposed by supersymmetry between the scale dimensions of scalar and tensor elds [20].

3 tree-level considerations

in this section we identify a simple four-point function of protected operators that in-
volves the exchange of unprotected operators and allows a direct determination of the
lowest order corrections to their anomalous dimensions and ope coecients. the choice
obviously falls on the operators in the n =4 current multiplet. they play a central role in
the correspondence with type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5, since they couple to
the elds of the gauged supergravity multiplet. dierently from ads-inspired computa-
tions, where the scalar singlets of the su(4) r-symmetry in the dilaton-axion sector are
amenable to explicit computations [8], we prefer to work, as in [3, 4] and in [18], with the

3

lowest scalar components in the current supermultiplet, qij
20, that belong to the represen-
tation 20 of su(4). in terms of the six real scalars i belonging to the representation 6
of su(4), they are dened as

qij
20 = tr(ij

the trace over the su(n) colour indices, a, b = 1, . . . , n 2  1, is dened as usual by

tr(t at b) =

(5)

(6)

where t a are the generators in the fundamental representation of the su(n) gauge group.
in order to x our normalisations we write down explicitly the two-point function of the
scalar elds, which reads

dots represent operators of (tree-level) scale dimension (0)  4. bold subscripts denote
the su(4) representations to which the various operators belong. besides the identity
operator, there appear protected as well as a priori unprotected operators. among the
protected single-trace operators one nds q20 itself with  = 2, and the r-symmetry
current j 
15 with  = 3. among the unprotected single-trace operators one nds operators
belonging to the long konishi multiplet, which we denote by k. k starts with the su(4)
singlet scalar of naive dimension (0) = 2

and includes also the classically conserved current, k
15 with (0) = 3. as discussed at
the end of sect. 2, positivity constraints on anomalous dimensions imply the bound   2
for the dimension of k1.
in order to illustrate the origin and the role of short distance logarithmic singularities
in the simplest way, it is convenient to consider the four-point green function

11(x2)c22(x3)c

22(x4)i

(10)

i =

2(cid:16)i + ii+3(cid:17)


i =

2(cid:16)i  ii+3(cid:17)

i = 1, 2, 3 ,

(12)

that belong to the representations 3+1 and 31 in the decomposition of the representation
6 of su(4) with respect to su(3)  u(1).

at tree-level g(h) contains only disconnected diagrams and has the expression

(13)

from the point of view of the ope (8) the x-dependence of eq. (13) may appear very
surprising, because one would naively expect that intermediate operators of dimension 2,
3 etc. should contribute giving rise to additional subdominant singularities in xpq. the
point is that the green function (10) can be expressed as the product of the two opes

11(y) =

c11(x)c

22(y) =

and cancellations among the contributions of dierent operators take place. for example,
the pole 1/x2
12 in the limit x12  0 (s-channel) is absent, since the contribution of the
20 exactly cancels the contributions of q(y )
operator q(x)
20 and k1 to the four-point func-
tion (13). note that this cancellation is not possible at higher orders, since k1 has an
anomalous dimension while q20 is protected.
similar tree-level cancellations take place among the spin one currents. for instance,
the potential pole x
12 has vanishing coecient because the components of the cur-
rents, k
11(y) are orthogonal to the ones that couple to
c22(x)c
15, so that this cancellation
will survive radiative corrections despite the fact that they induce an anomalous dimen-
sion for k
15. anticipating the results of the next section, let us note that
at one loop the only eld of tree-level dimension (0)  10 with non vanishing contribution

to the s-channel of the function (10) is the lowest konishi scalar k1. this demonstrates
that reading o the complete operator content from a given four-point function might be
rather subtle.

let us briey comment on the ope in the other two channels of g(h)

in (13). the
limit x13  0 in (10) exposes the u-channel (the t-channel is similar) and singles out the
double-trace operator
(19)

(0)

d(11|22) = c11c22 .

this operator is automatically normal ordered and belongs to the reducible 105 + 84
representation of su(4). in fact one has

(20)

(21)

105

as indicated, the operator d(11|22)

belongs to the 105 representation of su(4) whose
highest weight is [0, 4, 0]. since its naive dimension, (0), is exactly 4, d(11|22)
is the
lowest scalar component of a short and thus protected supermultiplet. without spoiling
the su(2, 2|4) superconformal invariance, the supermultiplet that starts with d105 can
be made orthogonal to the short supermultiplet associated to the quartic casimir that
starts with the scalar composite operator

105

in particular it is convenient to dene the combination

q105 = tr(4) .

(23)

that vanishes for n = 2 i.e. for an su(2) gauge group. notice that with this denition

bq105 has zero three-point function with two q20, for any n. as a consequence the
operator bq105 cannot contribute to the short distance limits that we study. the only
operator in the representation 105 that is relevant for our analysis is thus d105. in the
next sections we will argue that d105 does not receive quantum corrections to its naive
scale dimension and ope coecients. the above observation about the decoupling of
bq105 is in line with its ads interpretation as a kaluza-klein excitation ( = 4) of q20
the operator d(11|22)
belongs to a long supermultiplet instead since the highest weight
of the 84 has dynkin labels [2, 0, 2], while the naive dimension of d(11|22) is (0) = 4. the
operator d(11|22)

(24)

that lies in the 84 of su(4) and belongs to the konishi supermultiplet 1. the mixing
is maximal for su(2) in which case k84 and d84 are proportional to one another. in

1notice that the presence of the factor g2 in the normalisation of k(11|22)

is dictated by the form of the
supersymmetry transformations acting on the lowest component k1 in eq.(9) and implies a shortening of
the konishi supermultiplet in the free eld-theory limit [11].

84

6

general it is convenient to dene an operator bd84 that has vanishing two-point function
at tree-level with k84 much in the same way as in (23). at higher order one should
appropriately adjust the form of the linear combinations that diagonalise the two-point
functions in order to construct operators with well-dened anomalous dimensions.

4 one-loop perturbative calculations

in perturbative calculations it is necessary to work with an o-shell formulation, so that an
n =4 supereld approach, which admits only an on-shell description, cannot be employed.
the use of n =1 superspace techniques greatly simplies the necessary algebra compared
to component calculations. alternatively one could resort to the manifestly n =2 su-
persymmetric harmonic superspace approach, as in [10], in which the n =4 multiplet is
realised putting together a n =2 vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet.
we prefer to work in the more familiar n =1 formalism. in this approach, the n =4
vector multiplet decomposes into three n =1 chiral multiplets i and one n =1 vector
multiplet, all in the adjoint representation of the su(n) gauge group. the lowest scalar
components of the chiral multiplets are the i introduced above.

let us start by computing the superspace extension of g(h)(x1, x2, x3, x4) that we de-
note by (h)(z1, z2, z3, z4), where zp = (xp, p, p) are the coordinates of n =1 superspace.
as in the component eld computations of (10), the only tree level contribution to

(h)(z1, z2, z3, z4) = htrh(1)2i(z1)trh(

1)2i(z2)trh(2)2i(z3)trh(

2)2i(z4)i

(25)

comes from a disconnected super-diagram that grows as n 4. because of colour contrac-
tions, the order g2 correction to the disconnected diagram is trivially zero. in the fermi-
feynman gauge, no corrections to the supereld propagators should be included [22] and
there is a unique non-vanishing rst order correction represented by a single connected di-
agram, in which the internal propagator corresponds to the exchange of a chiral supereld
with avour i = 3. moreover, because of the non-renormalisation theorems for the two-
point functions discussed in [18], there are no non-vanishing disconnected super-diagrams
contributing at rst or higher order.

since we are dealing with green functions of composite operators the result is neces-
sarily depends on the -variables associated to each of the four external points. this is
not in agreement with the results of calculations presented in [23]. however, if we restrict
our attention to the lowest components of the chiral superelds, the expression in [23],
though rather implicit, turns out to be correct. the explicit result is

unlike correlation functions of elementary sym elds, that are infra-red problematic and
gauge-dependent (see e.g. [22, 24] for a recent analysis), the correlator (27) is well dened
at non-coincident points and it has all the expected symmetry properties.

notice that the representation of b(r, s) given by (30) is valid only in the physical
domain, i.e. in the region resulting from physically allowed choices of x2
pq. in the euclidian
regime it is dened by the condition p  0. although individual terms in (30) are
complex, the complete function is real and positive in the physical domain. moreover
the singularities corresponding to the three possible channels in the four-point function
g(h) are located at (r = 0, s = 1), (r = 1, s = 0) and (r = , s = ).

let us consider the limit x12  0. the four-point function behaves as

in agreement with previous results [20]. indeed the only other gauge-invariant operators
of dimension two that can be exchanged are the protected operators q20, which cannot
receive quantum corrections to their scale dimensions.
the subleading logarithmic singularity in this channel involves a rather complicated
mixture of double-trace operators and superconformal descendants of the konishi multi-
plet that will be discussed in detail in [25].

let us briey comment on the other channels. the limit x13  0 in (27) exposes
the u-channel (the t-channel is similar) and singles out the double-trace operator d(11|22)
dened in (19). as already observed, the d105 component is protected from receiving
corrections to ope coecients and anomalous dimension. this can be seen more clearly
by considering the short distance behaviour of the one-loop contribution to the four-point
function considered in [3]. the presence of logarithms in this channel imply that one or
both operators of naive dimension (0) = 4 in the 84 in eqs. (21), (24) have anomalous
dimension. although k84 alone could account for the logarithm in this channel, leaving
bd84 with vanishing anomalous dimension at one-loop level, in order to settle this issue
one has to consider another independent green function [25]. for instance one can take

5 non-perturbative instanton calculations

relying on the remarkable properties of instanton calculus, the one-instanton contribution
to a four-point function in n =4 sym theory with su(2) gauge group has been computed
(to lowest order in the coupling constant) in ref. [3]. the extension of that result to the
case of su(n) and to any instanton number in the large n limit has been given in [4].

following the steps detailed in [3], we give here a closed-form expression for the one-

instanton contribution to g(h) (eq. (10)).

we recall that in order to saturate the sixteen unlifted [4] fermionic zero-modes
i have to be replaced with

present in the one-instanton background, the elds i and 
the expressions

where f is the one-instanton eld-strength and  a

 + bx  a, a = i, 0, with
bx  = x() , are fermionic collective coordinates. the index i = 1, 2, 3 labels the
fermionic zero modes in the n =1 chiral multiplets, the index 0 those associated to the
n =1 gaugino. the instanton-induced scalar elds (43) satisfy the scalar equation in
the presence of the fermionic zero-modes. they correspond to the leading non-vanishing
eective eld congurations that result from the wick contractions with the yukawa
terms obtained after expanding the exponential of the action until a number of fermion
elds equal to the number of instanton induced fermionic zero modes are brought down.
the scalar eld congurations (43) can also be obtained directly from supersymmetry
transformations by acting twice on f with the supersymmetry and superconformal
transformations associated to s, not preserved in the instanton background.

after some fierz transformations on the fermionic collective coordinates the fermionic

integrations can be performed in a standard way [26] and yield

, the result (44) coincides with the one found in [3].

apart from numerical factors, the same results is obtained for any su(n) gauge
group [4]. this follows from the fact that the extra non-geometric 8n16 fermionic zero-
modes, present for n > 2, turn out to be eectively lifted, as they appear in quadrilinear
terms in the full sym action. the lifting can be most easily understood as the result of the
functional integration over the scalar eld uctuations around the classical conguration
( = 0), noticing that, in the semiclassical approximation in which we are working,
fermionic elds are to be eectively replaced by their zero mode expression. bosonising the
lifted fermionic zero-modes a la hubbard-stratonovich and performing the extra bosonic
integrations associated to the new bosonic zero modes produces the extra factor (n 
2)/(n  1) in front of (44) that precisely matches the ads-inspired expectation, n,
in the large n limit [4].

higher instanton numbers may be exactly taken into account in the large n limit,
because a saddle-point approximation is possible. contrary to naive expectations, the
instanton gas is far from being dilute in the sense that at large n the k instantons tend
to attract each other and share the same position, x0, and size, 0. still they lie in k
commuting su(2) subgroups of the su(n) gauge group. properly taking into account
the role of the lifted and bosonised fermionic zero-modes, one can show that the situation
is as if the k instanton moduli space were a single copy of ads5  s5 [4]. the same
situation prevails in type iib d-instanton computations and all k-dependent factors on
the sym side felicitously reproduce the type iib d-instanton induced terms [28, 29, 3].
in summary, up to computable overall constants, the one-instanton contribution to
the four-point functions under consideration is the same for any su(n) gauge group and,
in the large n limit, every instanton number contributes the same expression.
in the
large n limit, the sum over k gives rise to an overall non-holomorphic function of the
complexied gauge coupling  , which coincides with the non-perturbative d-instanton
contribution to the coecient, f4(,  ), appearing in front of the r4 terms in the type iib
low-energy eective action [28].
going back to eq. (44), we notice that the x0 integration resembles that of a standard
feynman diagram with momenta replaced by position dierences and can be performed
either by expressing it in terms of derivatives of the box-integral as

3it should be noted that for this class of four-point functions instanton and anti-instanton contributions
are simply complex conjugate to one another. on the contrary, at lowest order in g, correlation functions of
protected operators that violate the external automorphism u (1)b of the n =4 superconformal algebra,
whose ads counterpart is the anomalous u (1)b symmetry of the type iib supergravity, only receive
contribution from instantonic congurations with topological charge of a given sign [3, 27].

having obtained a closed expression for g(h), one can unambiguously study the be-
haviour when any two points are taken close to one another, xpq  0. an explicit calcula-
tion shows that i(r, s) has singularities only at the points (r = 0, s = 1), (r = 1, s = 0) and
(r = , s = ). taking into account the factor, x2
23, present in the complete
expression of g(h), one nds that the only case in which there is actually a singularity is

13x2

24x2

14x2

12

when any c approaches its conjugate c, which corresponds either to the limit x12  0 or
to x34  0. in terms of the conformal cross-ratios s and r introduced before, both limits,
in fact, correspond to r  0, s  1, where i(r, s) develops a logarithmic singularity. no-
tice that individual terms in i(r, s) have pole-type singularities (of degree up to seven),
but in the sum only a logarithmic singularity survives.

in the limit x12  0, the one-instanton plus one anti-instanton contribution to the

four-point function behaves as

the absence of a term of the type log(x2
12 implies that there is no one-instanton
contribution to the anomalous dimension of the scalar k1. by supersymmetry arguments
this result extends to the whole konishi multiplet. the absence of a term of the type
1/x2
12 conrms the vanishing of any quantum correction to the two-point function of the
protected gauge-invariant operators of dimension 2, q20. the leading logarithmic singu-
larity present in (49) comes from a mixture of double-trace operators of naive dimension
(0) = 4. extracting the non-perturbative contribution to the anomalous dimension and
ope coecients of all these operators is beyond the scope of this paper and will be
discussed elsewhere [25]. let us stress, however, that the non-vanishing coecient of the
logarithm in (49) implies that at least one double trace scalar operator of tree-level dimen-
sion (0) = 4 has a non-vanishing one instanton correction to its anomalous dimension.

in the other two channels the vanishing of the factor x2

23 leads to a vanishing
result. this immediately implies that only operators of dimension higher than four can
contribute in these channels. notice that performing a similar ope analysis of the four-
point function computed in [3] leads one to conclude that d105 cannot be exchanged in
the u-channel. the remaining operators of dimension four that can be exchanged in this
channel belong to the representation 84 of su(4) and are the component of the konishi

multiplet k84 in eq. (24) and the double-trace operator bd84 introduced at the end of
section 3. since, as we have demonstrated, the one-instanton correction to the anomalous
dimension of k84 is zero, one can immediately conclude that the one-instanton correction
to the anomalous dimension of bd84 is zero as well.
let us also note that in general the one (anti-)instanton contributions to the anomalous

the observation that neither operators in the supercurrent multiplet nor operators
in the konishi multiplet are exchanged in any of the intermediate channels at the one
(anti-) instanton level, implies that the known non-renormalisation theorems for three-
point functions of protected operators [18] can be generalised at non-perturbative level.
this result should not be considered in contradiction with the expected s-duality of the

13

n =4 sym theory, as s-duality is not a pointwise symmetry relating individual operators.
for instance, string states, such as those corresponding to the konishi multiplet, get
transformed into d-string states or to other dyonic states, so that a signicant reshuing
among operators should take place under s-duality. slightly at variant with respect to [27],
we only expect that the whole spectrum of (anomalous) dimensions and the whole set of
ope coecients should be invariant under s-duality.

6 conclusions and comments on ads

the outcome of our analysis is that the short distance logarithmic behaviour of the green
functions in n =4 sym theory in the (super)conformal phase is a manifestation of the
presence of non vanishing anomalous dimensions of unprotected operators. a highly non-
trivial, but technically very involved, check of the validity of our interpretation, would
consist in showing that the next order corrections give rise to square logarithms with co-
ecients that are precisely given by the squares of the rst order coecients as demanded
for the exponentiation of the logarithmic terms.

the presence of logarithms might be thought to spoil the perturbative niteness prop-
erties of n =4 sym theory that have been known for a long time. although, as we have
argued in this paper, this is not true, the analysis presented in [22] has pointed out a
number of problems in the perturbative computation of green functions of elementary
(super) elds. the calculations performed in [22] have claried many subtleties related
to the gauge-xing procedure of the theory, both in the description in terms of compo-
nent elds and using the n =1 supereld formalism. the appearance of uv divergences
in o-shell propagators, when the wesszumino (wz) gauge is exploited, has been dis-
cussed and it has been shown that relaxing the wz gauge choice makes uv divergences
disappear.

the analysis of [22, 24] has also shown that in green functions of elementary (su-
per)elds there are ir divergences even for non-exceptional values of the momenta. these
are in fact gauge artifacts and are due to the 1/k4 behaviour of the propagator of the
lowest component of the vector supereld. this problematic term in the supereld propa-
gator disappears in the (supersymmetric generalisation of the) fermifeynman gauge and
in the case the wz gauge is employed. it would be interesting to obtain an explicit check
of the cancellation of ir divergences in gauge invariant green functions for an arbitrary
gauge-choice, even without restricting the theory to the wz gauge.

finally let us discuss the bearing of our results on the validity and the meaning of
the maldacena conjecture. we have shown by scaling arguments that all the perturbative
and non-perturbative contributions to the anomalous dimensions of multi-trace operators
actually vanish in the large n limit. the situation for the konishi multiplet is dierent,
because its anomalous dimension does not seem to vanish in the large n limit. actually
on the basis of the ads/scft correspondence it is suggested that it grows as large as
n 1/4, eventually decoupling from the operator algebra.

short-distance logarithmic singularities have been shown to appear in genuine ads
supergravity calculations [8, 30]. these logarithms are expected to be related to the
exchange of multi-particle bound states in the bulk which are in correspondence with

14

multi-trace operators on the boundary. in view of the vanishing of the anomalous dimen-
sions of multi-trace operators that we nd at large n, it is not obvious to us what is the
relation between the logarithms seen in perturbative and non-perturbative n =4 sym
calculations and the logarithms identied in [8, 30] despite their suggestive similarity [31].
