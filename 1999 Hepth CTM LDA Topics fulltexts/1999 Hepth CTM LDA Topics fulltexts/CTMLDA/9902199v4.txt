abstract

the two-dimensional chiral anomaly is calculated using dierential regular-
ization.
it is shown that the anomaly emerges naturally in the vector and
axial ward identities on the same footing as the four-dimensional case. the
vector gauge symmetry can be achieved by an appropriate choice of the mass
scales without introducing the seagull term. the origin for the universality
of the result obtained in dierential regularization is analyzed.

one of the most remarkable dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional massless quan-
tum electrodynamics (qed2) is that the photon eld becomes massive through a dynami-
cal higgs mechanism induced by the fermions [1]. the essence for its occurrence lies in the

spontaneous breaking of the global chiral symmetry u(1)eu(1), u(1) and eu (1) denoting the

abelian group associated with the charge and chirality of the fermion, respectively. conse-
quently, the vacuum of this model can exhibit a doubly innite degeneracy characterized by
fermion number and chirality [2]. in particular, the degeneracy with respect to the chiral-
ity is analogous to that found in four dimensional quantum chromodynamics (qcd4) [3].
therefore, qed2 can serve as a laboratory for exploring the vacuum structure of qcd4,
which still remains a puzzle.

the two-dimensional chiral anomaly plays a crucial role in revealing this dynamical
behavour [2, 4]. in fact, this two-dimensional chiral anomaly was found by johnson [5] prior
to the discovery of the famous abj chiral anomaly in four dimensional [6] 1. later an explicit
perturbative calculation was also carried out in ref. [7]. in the last decade this anomaly has
been re-investigated by various perturbative and non-perturbative calculation techniques
such as dimensional, pauli-villars and zeta function regularization schemes as well as a
dispersion relation approach [8] and topological analysis [9]. recently, it is calculated again
by a quite old method regularization called analytic regularization [10]. however, we think
that it is still worthwhile to use newly developed quantum eld theory methods to gain

insight. this may not only reveal new features of the anomaly, but also test the feasibility
of the modern computation techniques.

in view of the above considerations, in this letter we shall use a relatively new regular-
ization scheme called dierential regularization [11] to calculate the two-dimensional chiral
anomaly. the basic idea of this regularization is quite simple. it works in coordinate space
for euclidean eld theory and is based on the observation that the higher order amplitude
cannot have a fourier transform into momentum space due to the short-distance singularity.
thus one can regulate such an amplitude by rst writing its singular parts as the deriva-
tives of the less singular functions, which have a well dened fourier transform, and then
performing fourier transformation in partial integration and discarding the surface term.
in this way one can directly get the renormalized result. up to now this method and its
modied one have been applied successfully to almost every eld theories, including the
supersymmetric ones [1118].

the main reason for us to adopt this regularization scheme to study the two-dimensional
chiral anomaly is its great advantage over other regularization schemes in preserving gauge
symmetry. the maintenance of the gauge symmetry in dierential regularization is achieved
by appropriately choosing the indenite renormalization scale at the nal stage of the cal-
culation. therefore, this regularization method can provide a most democratic expression
for the chiral anomaly. in pauli-villars, dimensional and zeta function regularization, on
the other hand, a renormalization condition is already imposed on the vector and axial
ward identities when calculating the chiral anomaly. that is, these regularization schemes
themselves are compatible with the conservation of vector gauge symmetry and violate the
axial vector symmetry, thus one can naturally get an anomalous axial vector ward identity.
dierential regularization is dierent. the study of chiral anomaly was initially carried out
in ref. [11] and [14], and it was shown that the anomalous term can naturally arise in
the vwi and awi on the same footing. furthermore, combined with the conformal prop-
erty of the correlate function, as initially proposed by baker and johnson [19], dierential
regularization was used to investigate the possible two-loop radiative correction to the chi-
ral anomaly [20] and the gravitational axial anomaly [21]. therefore, the investigation of
the chiral anomaly in terms of dierential regularization will denitely be more powerful
in revealing the quantum structure of the theory. in particular, dierential regularization
does not modify the original lagrangian at all, hence it never shifts the value of a prim-
itively divergent feynman diagram away from its singularities, and neither does it extend
the dimensionality of the space-time or introduce a regulator [14]. thus this regularization
method is free from the ambiguity in dening the dimensional continuation of 5 occurred
in dimensional regularization. the details of the calculation are also much more simple than
in pauli-villars and zeta function regularization.

we now set up the framework for calculating this anomaly. the lagrangian of qed2

with one avour fermion in euclidean space is read as follows [4]:

l = (i/  e/a  m) 

1

ff,

,  = 1, 2,

where the -matrices are chosen as the two-component form

1 = i1, 2 = i1, 5 = 21 = i3.

clearly

and

{, } = 2,

5 = .

classically, the following vector and axial currents

satisfy the identities

j = ,

 = 5
j5

j = 0, j5

 = 2imj5

with j5 being the pseudo-scalar current,

j5 5.

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

it is well known that the chiral anomaly in qed2 comes from the two-point function [9]

5

(x  y) = ht [j(x)j5

 (y)]i.

(8)

this is contrary to the four-dimensional case, where the chiral anomaly comes from the
triangle composed of the axial and vector currents. due to the relation (4), t 5
 is relevant
to the vacuum polarization tensor

5

(x  y) = (x  y).

(9)

thus we can get 5

 via the vacuum polarization tensor.

if the classical symmetries of the theory were preserved at the quantum level there would

exist the following vector ward identity (vwi),

x
5

(x  y) = x

(x  y) = y

 (x  y) = 0

and the corresponding axial vector one (awi),

y
 5

(x  y) = 2im5

(x  y)

with

5

(x  y)ht [j(x)j5(y)]i

(10)

(11)

(12)

the above naive ward identities can be written in the more familiar form in momentum
space,

p5

(p) = p(p) = p(p) = 0

and

pt 5

(p) = 2m5

(p).

(13)

(14)

in fact, due to the chiral anomaly, the above ward identities will be violated.
for massless qed2, the propagator of the fermion in euclidean space is2

s(x) = 

1

/ ln

x

,

x|x|,

while for the massive case, we have

s(x) =

2

(/  m)k0(mx),

(15)

(16)

where k is the modied bessel function of the second kind. it it has the following asymp-
totical expansion near x0,

with  being the euler constant.

for simplicity we rst consider the massless case. in fact, the chiral anomaly is inde-
pendent of the fermionic mass, but for completeness we shall check the massive case later.
with the propagator (15) we write the vacuum polarization tensor

(x) = tr [s(x)s(x)] =

(20)

(21)

upon substitution of (21) into the vacuum polarization tensor (18), it seems that the term
with the tensor structure  could cancel. in fact, this is not allowed since in two dimension

2in fact, we should introduce a infrared cut-o  for this massless propagator [4] so that we have
a well-dened propagator, s(x) = 1/(2)/ ln(1/x). this cut-o can also make the argument
of the logarithm dimensionless. however, since later we only care about the uv (short-distance)
behavour of the theory, especially for the convenience of calculations, we will not introduce this
mass scale.

4

the term  1/x2 is obviously singular. it is analogous to the fact that two divergent terms
with the same form but opposite sign in momentum space cannot be canceled, only after
a regularization procedure is performed so that they become well dened, the substraction
operation can work. otherwise, a nite term will probably lost since the dierence of two
innite quantities is generally not zero. we therefore use dierential regularization schemes
to make 1/x2 well dened. writing

we get

exactly the analogue of four-dimensional case [11], 1/x4 = 1/42[ln(m 2x2)/x2].

note that eqs.(28) and (29) was actually obtained in ref. [12], but the vector gauge
invariance was imposed from the beginning. thus the nite local ambiguity parameterized
by m1/m2 had not been observed, whereas here we show it explicitly in (25) and (26).

eq.(28) explicitly shows that the vector ward identities are satised

(x) = (x) = 5

(x) = 0,

while the axial ward identity becomes anomalous

eq.(31) clearly gives the two-dimensional chiral anomaly, which will results in the addition
of an anomalous term to the lagrangian (1)

(33)

furthermore, there appears no renormalization scale in (28). this implies that those two
current two-point functions are nite and hence coincide with the result obtained by other
approaches [9].

as in the four-dimensional case, (25) and (26) have displayed a most democratic expres-

sion for two-dimensional anomaly. choosing a general relation

we obtain the two-point functions

the choice n = 2 is just the case discussed above. the n = 0 case just corresponds to
the conservation of axial vector current but an anomalous vector current. in any case, the
vector and axial ward identities cannot both be fullled simultaneously.

the massive case can be calculated in a similar way. the vacuum polarization tensor is

with the choice (27) of the renormalization scale, it can be easily checked that the vector

ward identity is satised whereas the axial one becomes anomalous with the usual form,

(48)

eq.(47) is the same as that obtained by dimensional regularization [9].

eqs.(26), (27) and the calculation deriving them show that the origin of the two-
dimensional anomaly is the same as in the four-dimensional case [14]. to regulate two
dierent singular pieces, one has to introduce two dierent mass scales. the terms with
these two mass scales actually can combine into a nite amplitude with a continuous one-
parameter shift degree of freedom given by the quotient of these two scales. this degree
of freedom cannot accommodate the vector and axial vector ward identities simultaneously
so that the two-dimensional chiral anomaly has to emerge and manifests itself in the vector
and axial vector ward identities on the same footing.

in summary, we have derived two-dimensional anomaly neatly in terms of dierential
regularization. compared with other approaches such as dimensional and pauli-villars reg-
ularization, this regularization scheme has exhibited clearly the origin of the chiral anomaly
and especially, the anomaly has manifested itself in the vector and axial ward identities

8

impartially. furthermore, the impartiality is achieved automatically in dierential regular-
ization and does not require an explicit particular choice of the renormalization conditions
on the physical amplitude as other regularization schemes [22]. this has not only demon-
strate the applicability of dierential regularization to two-dimensional gauge theory, but
also has revealed an intrinsic anomaly structure of the theory.

another point which should be emphasized is that we have overcome the diculty of the
gauge non-invariance of the two-point function of qed2 in coordinate space. it is known that
the vacuum polarization tensor calculated before in coordinate space is not gauge invariant,
a covariant seagull term has to be added to gain the gauge symmetry [23]. of course, the
reason for this is that the singularity is not properly regulated. here in the framework of
dierential regularization we have achieved the gauge invariance by a appropriate choice of
the mass scales.

the above acquisition in dierential regularization is not occasional and the origin lies
in dierential regularization itself3. as it is shown above, the basic operation in dieren-
tial regularization is replacing a singular term by the derivative of another less singular
function. this operation has provided a possibility to add arbitrary local terms into the
amplitude since we have to solve a dierential equation for non-coincident points. when-
ever performing such a operation, we are introducing into a new arbitrary local term. for
the issue we are investigating, the vacuum polarization tensor in qed2, this arbitrariness
is parameterized by the ratio of the two renormalization scales, m1/m2. in fact, this case is
exactly the phenomenon emphasized by jackiw [24] recently. according to renormalization
theory, the introduction of an arbitrary local term in the amplitude is equivalent to the ad-
dition of a nite counterterm to the lagrangian. therefore, from this viewpoint, dierential
regularization can yield the most general quantum eective action than any other regular-
ization schemes.
in particular, dierential regularization has another remarkable feature,
that is, this local parameterized ambiguity can be xed at the nal stage of the calcula-
tion by imposing some physical requirements. this special feature presented by dierential
regularization gives a sharp contrast to other regularization schemes such as dimensional,
pauli-villars and cut-o regularization etc. these regularization methods, together with
given renormalization prescription, can x the arbitrary local terms automatically. in dif-
ferent regularization methods, these arbitrary local terms are dierent. no regularization
has the preference to say that it gives the right value for these local terms, except that there
are some more profound justications. for example, in a gauge theory the gauge symmetry
should be preserved, then dimensional regularization can provide a more reasonable result
than the naive cut-o regularization method. therefore, in this aspect, dierential regular-
ization can give a more universal result than any other regularization method, since it does
not impose any preferred choice on the amplitude. this is just the reason why the chiral
anomaly can emerge in both vector and axial vector ward identities on the same footing,
while in dimensional and pauli-villars regularization method, the anomaly only reects in
the axial ward identity since the vector gauge symmetry has already been preferred in these
regularization schemes.
