abstract

we describe the local d=4 eld theory on deformed minkowski space as nonlocal rela-
tivistic eld theory on standard minkowski spacetime. for simplicity the case of -deformed
scalar eld  with the interaction 4 is considered, and the deformed interaction vertex is
described.

introduction

the conventional eldtheoretic models in elementary particle physics (e.g.
standard model 
yang-mills theory with spinorial and higgs sector) are described by quantum eld theory on
standard d=4 minkowski space. the addition of gravity eects can be realized in the following
two steps:

a) we consider eldtheoretic models in curved background of classical gravitational eld,

describing curved spacetime geometry.

b) further we quantize curved spacetime geometry by considering quantized gravitational

eld.

[1-3]).

at present it is not known how to handle with reasonable accuracy the quantum gravity correc-
tions, i.e. describe eld theories in the background of quantized geometries. it is known however,
that due to divergent quantum eects in einstein gravity the notion of classical spacetime can
not be used at distances comparable and smaller than the planck length lp (lp  1033cm) (see
e.g.
in front of this diculty one way of generalizing the standard framework of local
relativistic elds is to replace classical spacetime points by some primary extended objects (e.g.
fundamental strings, p-branes etc.) providing new eld theory (e.g. string eld theory) which leads
to nite quantum corrections. another way, closer to the idea of quantized geometry, is to replace
commuting spacetime coordinates by noncommuting generators of a quantized minkowski space.
there is a hope that such a quantized spacetime geometry will provide additional convergence
factors or even nite quantum eld theory.

the standard minkowski space can be described as the translation sector of d=4 poincare
group, and relativistic phase space is obtained by adding the fourmomentum sector of d=4 poincare
algebra. analogously, quantum minkowski space and quantum deformed relativistic phase space
can be obtained respectively from the translation sector of d=4 quantumdeformed poincare group
and fourmomenta belonging to quantum poincare algebra. in the last years there were proposed
dierent quantum deformations of d=4 poincare symmetries (see e.g.
[4-7]) in the form of real
noncommutative and noncocommutative hopf algebras.

in particular there was proposed as the rst such deformation the socalled deformation
of relativistic symmetries [4,5] introducing fundamental mass (or length) parameter .

bicrossproduct [8] basis the deformed poincare hopf algebra with generators m = (mi =

our aim in this paper is to consider the eld theory on deformed minkowski space, obtained
from the deformed poincare group by a suitable contraction. an important tool will be the use
of deformed fourier transform, describing the elds on noncommutative minkowski space with
generators x = (xi, x0) in the following way (px  pi xi  p0 x0)1

e(p) is a classical function on commuting fourmomentum space p = (pi, p0) and (~p ~x  pi xi)

the deformed exponential (1.4) describes the canonical element [9,10] or t matrix [11,12] for
the pair of dual hopf algebras hx and hp, which describe respectively deformed hopf algebras
of spacetime coordinates and fourmomenta2

 which is invariant under the shift in fourmomentum

with the classical fourier transform (1.8).

it is easy to see that in the limit    we get x  x and the formula (1.3) can be identied
we shall describe the deformation of relativistic local eld theory in the following three steps:
1) we replace in conventional local relativistic eld theory the classical minkowski coordinates
x by quantum minkowski coordinates x, and relativisticcovariant dierential operators dening
free elds by corresponding covariant dierential operators on deformed minkowski space. the
new action is obtained by integration of local products of deformed elds and their derivatives
over deformed minkowski space.

2) we substitute in the deformed action the fourier transforms (1.3), apply the formula
(1.7), and replace the integration over deformed minkowski space by the deformed convolution

integrals. we calculate all occurring deformed integralsrr d4 x by using the formula

1

(2)4zz d4 x : eipx : = 4(p) .

the integral (1.9) in the two-dimensional case in dierent context has been used by majid

[13,14].

3) in order to interpret the deformation in standard minkowski space we use the formula

(1.8). the deformed convolution integrals of fourier transforms e(p) become the dependent

nonlocal vertices of elds (x) in standard minkowski space.

2 deformed minkowski space: dierential bicovariant cal-

culus, vector elds and integration

a) dierential bicovariant calculus.

on deformed h with four selfadjoint generators x one can construct a vedimensional

bicovariant dierential calculus with the basis [15,16,17]

satisfying the relation

and (a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

the minkowski space (1.5a-b) carries the left covariant action of poincare group (1.2)

l(x) = 

  x + a  1l ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

and the relations (2.2-3) are covariant under the following transformations of the left action (2.4)

    ,

el( ) = 

el( 5) = 1l   5 .

one can also dene the covariant right action of another poincare group

r(x) = x   

  1l  a 
 ,

(2.6)

obtained by the change    in the formulae (1.2). such right covariance quantum group
provides the following covariance of the relations (2.2-3)

b) deformed vector elds.
in order to dene the vector elds describing left or right partial derivatives a acting on

el( ) =     

 ,

el =  5  1l ,

functions on deformed minkowski space we write:

in particular using leibnitz rule d(f g) = df g + f dg we obtain that3

df = l

a f   a =  a r

a f .

because p : eipx :=: 1

i eipx : using the fourier transform (1.3) one obtains

in bicrossproduct basis one obtains [8]

x (x)i ,

where p  hp, or equivalently

p : (x) : = :

(x) :

one can express the vector elds in terms of the fourmomentum generators p of deformed
poincare algebra (1.1):

a(x) = a(p) : (x) :

(2.15)

where a are given by relations (2.10).

c) invariant integration over deformed minkowski space.
the basic formula (1.9) and the denitions (1.3) and (1.8) lead to the equality4

1

(2)4zz d4 x (x) =e(0) =
zz d4 x(cid:0)x   

in order to show the poincare invariance of (2.16) we should prove that5

  i  a 
3further we shall use the left partial derivatives and put a  l

the fourier transform (2.24) substituted in (1.8) provide the following notion of deformed adjoint

where r = exp 1
one gets the following complete set of fourdimensional eigenfunctions, with time coordinate added:

it should be mentioned, however, that the expansion in 1
 provides the terms proportional to the
powers of ~x and the nature of the nonlocality described by the exponential of dierential operator
is not well described by such a power expansion.8

in this paper we described the method by which the corrections to fourdimensional relativistic
eld theory due to the deformations of relativistic symmetry can be calculated. we discuss here only
classical theory. the theory of quantized elds can be obtained by replacing the fourier transforms

e(p) by a noncommutative deformed algebra; in the case of free elds these fourier transforms

can be replaced by suitably normalized standard creation and annihilation operators.9 another
way of handling the quantum corrections is the application of the functional integration method,
which in principle can be also applied to nonlocal eld-theoretic models. further developments in
these directions are at present under consideration.

4 conclusions

we would like to point out that in this paper we present a new scheme providing the rules how
to calculate the corrections to the fourdimensional local relativistic interacting eld theory in the
presence of quantum deformations10. our scheme can be described by the following diagram:

classical local
eld theory

-deformation


  

-deformation

classical nonlocal
-deformed eld theory

-deformed

momentum space

our scheme is valid for any deformation of d=4 poincare symmetries with commutative four-
momenta. such deformations can be described by the poincare quantum group with the following
bicrossproduct structure:

p (q) = o(3, 1)  t (q)

4

,

(4.1)

where

- o(3, 1) is the classical lorentz algebra, with primitive coproducts (classical hopf-lie algebra).

8in similar way the nite shift operator eax is very inaccurately approximated by the powers (ax)n.
9this way of quantizing is correct for deformation. for other deformations (see e.g.

[19,20,21]) one should

introduce quantum  deformed oscillator variables.

10it should be mentioned that the deformation of local interaction vertices in the presence of spacetime coordi-
nates commuting to a nonvanishing cnumber (see [1]) were considered by filk [22]. recently also the deformations
of twodimensional theories were considered in [23].

- t (q)

4

describes the hopf algebra of translations (see (1.5a-b) in our case) deformed in a way

consistent with the bicrossproduct structure (4.1).

it appears that the deformed spacetime translations t (q)

4

should be described by a set of

relations

[x, x ] =

1


c 

 x +

1
2

t ,

(4.2)

with suitable conditions for the dimensionless coecients c 
 , - t, which can be obtained from
the results presented in [7]. the deformation described in this paper is distinguished by the
property that it preserves the classical nonrelativistic o(3) symmetries.

in conclusion we would like to point out the following two diculties which we found while

calculating our corrections:

i) the corrections are nonlocal in time and are not translationinvariant (see. e.g. (3.13) and
(3.15)). this property occurs also if we introduce deformed adjoint operation (2.25) in classical
minkowski space.

ii) the nonsymmetric coproduct of threemomenta requires some novel approach to the problem

of statistics and the notion of bosons and fermions in the presence of deformation.

the rst diculty means that the deformed eld theory looks quite dierent from the unde-
formed one, and it is not yet clear how such modied eld theory could be useful in fundamental
interactions theory. this paper should be treated also as an indication of the problems which
are met when we modify local eld theory in a way covariant under quantumdeformed poincare
symmetries.
in particular we understand that because the basic commutation relations of de-
formed poincare generators and coproducts (see(1.1)) contain nonlinear functions of momenta, the
standard abelian translation invariance has to be lost.

the second diculty we consider rather of technical nature, which should be solved by the
introduction of some highly nontrivial unitary operator, representing the exchange of spacetime
position of two deformed bosonic or fermionic particles (for the solution of an analogous but
much simpler problem see [24]).

it should be mentioned that preliminary results of this paper have been presented at xxii

international colloquium on grouptheoretic methods in july 1998 (hobart, tasmania).
