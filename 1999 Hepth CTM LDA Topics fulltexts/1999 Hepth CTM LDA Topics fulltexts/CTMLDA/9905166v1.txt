abstract. topological terms in the o(3) nonlinear sigma model in (1 + 1) and
(2 + 1) dimensions are re-examined based on the description of the su (2)-valued
eld g. we rst show that the topological soliton term in (1 + 1) dimensions arises
from the unitary representations of the group characterizing the global structure of
the symmetry inherent in the description, in a manner analogous to the appearance
of the -term in yang-mills theory in (3 + 1) dimensions. we then present a
detailed argument as to why the conventional hopf term, which is the topological
counterpart in (2+1) dimensions and has been widely used to realize fractional spin
and statistics, is ill-dened unless the soliton charge vanishes. we show how this
restriction can be lifted by means of a procedure proposed recently, and provide
its physical interpretation as well.

1. introduction

the o(3) nonlinear sigma model (nsm) is a model ubiquitous in physics, being used in
elds ranging from condensed matter physics to high energy physics. it describes physical
systems that undergo a spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry o(3) by means of a
a=1(na)2 = 1. the dynamics of the model is

vector eld n(x, t) with unit length |n|2 = p3

governed by the lagrangian,

l0(n) =

1
22 (n)2,

(1.1)

where  is a coupling constant and  runs from 0 to the spacetime dimension d + 1. it is
customary to assume that the eld approaches to a constant vector n0 at spatial innity,

n(x, t)  n0

as

|x|  .

(1.2)

due to this boundary condition (1.2), at a xed time t the eld n(x, t) can be regarded
as a map from the (eective) space sd to the target s2 with the xed value n0 assigned
to the image of spatial innity. in other words, the conguration space cd of the model is
given by the set of based maps from sd to s2, i.e., cd = map0(sd, s2).

it has been widely known that the o(3) nsm admits topological terms which can be
added to (1.1). the best known topological term is the soliton term in (1 + 1)-dimensions,

lsoliton =

h
8

 abcnanb nc ,

(1.3)

which is formed out of the volume element of the target space s2. the presence of h, along
with the angle parameter , signals the fact that the term is of quantum origin. on the
other hand, in (2 + 1) dimensions one has the hopf term, which has been used to bestow
fractional spin and statistics upon instanton (skyrmion) excitations [1, 2, 3, 4]. in terms
of the eld strength f := abcnanbnc and the connection a given as a solution
to f = a   a, the conventional hopf term used in the literature takes the form
of the chern-simons term,

lhopf = 

h
322 f a,

(1.4)

where again  is an angle parameter.

the two topological terms mentioned above share the origin in that they arise from
the same topological structure characterized by the fundamental group of the respective
conguration space,

1(c1) = 2(s2) = zz ,

1(c2) = 3(s2) = zz ,

(1.5)

2

which are derived from the identities for homotopy groups k(map0(sn, sm)) = k+n(sm)
valid for non-negative integers k (see, e.g., [5]). however, the two terms are not quite the
same in status because of the dierence in the structure of connectedness,

0(c1) = 1(s2) = 0 ,

0(c2) = 2(s2) = zz .

(1.6)

the disconnectedness of the space c2 suggests that there are solitons/antisolitons which
may hamper the topological term (1.4) to be dened rmly. in fact, this has been pointed
out earlier in [5, 6] where it was shown that the hopf term in the conventional form (1.4)
is well-dened only in the vanishing soliton number sector.

the prime aim of the present paper is to examine closely the hopf term in the (2 + 1)-
dimensional nsm, and thereby show that the procedure proposed in [5, 6] to extend the
applicable domain of the term to the whole conguration space is viable mathematically
and also natural from physical point of view. our argument is based primarily on the ad-
joint orbit parameterization (aop) of the model where one uses a group (su (2)-)valued
eld g instead of the vector eld n in the original description. the aop has been intro-
duced in [7, 8] to describe the nsm in the general framework of g/h coset models, but it
turns out to be advantageous over the original description especially in treating topological
quantities, which is a property crucial for implementing the procedure proposed.

we also present here a path-integral derivation of the soliton term (1.3)  which is
well-dened for any congurations in the (1 + 1)-dimensional nsm  by a method similar
to that used to induce the -term in yang-mills theory in (3 + 1) dimensions [9]. this
will highlight the analogy of the two terms as a quantum mechanically induced topological
term, and at the same time elucidate the usefulness of the aop for the nsm.

we begin our discussion by reviewing the hamiltonian formulation of the model in
(d + 1) dimensions using the aop in section 2. we then show in section 3 that in the
(1 + 1)-dimensional nsm the soliton term arises from the unitary representations of the
fundamental group associated with the gauge symmetry inherent to the aop. in section
4, the hopf term in the (2 + 1)-dimensional nsm is examined in detail in the original
description, and then in section 5 it is re-examined in the aop to present the procedure
of extension and its physical interpretation. section 6 is devoted to our conclusion and
discussions, including the possibility of the hopf term being a topological wess-zumino
term in (1 + 1) dimensions.

2. hamiltonian formulation in the aop

the aop is a description of the nsm identifying the target space of the eld n(x, t)
as a nontrivial adjoint orbit of a lie group g. for our o(3) nsm, we take g = su (2) and

3

use {ta = a/2i; a = 1, 2, 3} for a basis of the lie algebra su(2). with an su (2)-valued
eld g(x, t) we then consider

g t3 g1 = nata,

(2.1)

where the l.h.s. forms the adjoint orbit passing through t3, which is then identied with
the target s2 of n(x, t) satisfying |n| = 1. note that the aop possesses inherent ambiguity
associated with the subgroup u (1)  su (2) generated by the element t3. indeed, n(x, t)
is unchanged under the transformations

g(x, t)  g(x, t) h(x, t),

(2.2)

for any (smooth) function h(x, t)  u (1). on account of this ambiguity, the boundary
condition for g(x, t) which corresponds to (1.2) for n(x, t) becomes

g(x, t)  g0 k(x, t)

as

|x|  ,

(2.3)

where g0  su (2) is a constant element fullling g0 t3 g1
0ta and k(x, t)  u (1)
is an arbitrary function dened at spatial innity. the boundary condition (2.3) implies
that, at a xed time, unlike n which can be regarded as a map sd  s2, the map g
used in the aop can only be treated as a map from a d-dimensional disc to the group,
dd  su (2), with dd  sd1 being identied with spatial innity. under the aop the
original lagrangian (1.1) becomes3

0 = na

l0(g) =

1
22 tr (g1g|r)2.

(2.4)

the lagrangian (2.4) has a (trivial) local u (1) symmetry under (2.2) due to the ambiguity
of the aop mentioned above.

in order to construct the hamiltonian formulation of the nsm in (d + 1)-dimensional
spacetime, we adopt diracs procedure for constrained systems and introduce a set of
su (2) variables a(x), a = 1, 2, 3, to parametrize g(x) = g(a(x)). from their conjugate
momenta a = l(g)/ a and the matrix n a
b b = (cid:26) 1

with (n 1)a

to be noted is that j(x) = j a(x)ta is independent of the parameterization a and, together

btb := g1(g/a), we dene

|r denotes x|r =

u := u/t and u := u/x (for d = 1).

with g(x), parametrizes the phase space of the model, forming the following fundamental
poisson bracket,

{ j a(x) , j b(y) } = abc j c(x) (d)(x  y),
{ j a(x) , g(y) } = g(x) ta (d)(x  y),

{ g(x) , g(y) } = 0.

(2.6)

the legendre transform of the lagrangian (2.4) then leads to the hamiltonian

h0(g, j) = r ddx h0 with

h0(g, j) =

2
2

tr(j|r)2 +

1
22 tr (g1ig|r)2.

note that our primary constraint (in diracs notation),

(g, j)  0,

where (g, j) := j 3(x),

(2.7)

(2.8)

generates the innitesimal right transformation associated with the gauge transformation
(2.2). since the constraint (2.8) commutes with the hamiltonian (2.7) under the poisson
bracket (2.6), no further (secondary) constraints arise.

3. the soliton term

we now specialize to the (1 + 1)-dimensional case and show that the soliton term (1.3)
arises as a result of quantization. to this end, we rst observe that for d = 1 the spatial
innity consists of two points x =  and we can always eliminate the arbitrary function
k(x, t) in (2.3) by a gauge transformation (2.2). thus, instead of (2.3) we may consider
the simplied boundary condition, g(x, t)  g0 as |x|  , without loss of generality.
under this condition, at a xed time the function h(x, t) in (2.2) becomes a map from the
(eective) space s1 to the target u (1)  s1. thus, those gauge transformations can be
classied by the winding number,

w(h) =

1

4 zs 1

dx tr t3(h1h)

(3.1)

of the map, and a representative map possessing the winding number n  zz is given by
hn(x; l) := e4nxt3/l, where l is the length of the space s1. gauge transformations with
zero winding number can be generated by innitesimal transformations and are called
small gauge transformations, whereas those with non-zero winding number are called
large gauge transformations. let us next see the consequences of the invariance of the
theory under these transformations in quantum theory.

5

upon quantizing the model in schrodinger picture, state vectors are represented by
wave functionals [g(x)] where the argument g(x) denotes a conguration at a xed time.
observables on phase space are now regarded as self-adjoint operators (although we use
the same notation as before) and, in particular, the canonical momenta conjugate to a(x)
are realized by functional derivatives a(x) = ih/a(x). the gauge symmetry of the
theory is ensured by requiring that under gauge transformations (2.2) physical functionals
be invariant

phys[g(x)h(x)] = eif [h(x)] phys[g(x)],

(3.2)

up to a phase eif given by some functional f [h(x)]. for small gauge transformations this
(with eif = 1) follows from the condition that implements the rst class constraint (2.8)
in the quantum theory,

j 3(x) phys[g(x)] = (n 1)3
b


b phys[g(x)] = 0,

(3.3)

which is the analogue of the gauss law in gauge theory.

to nd out the phase factor eif [h] acquired for large gauge transformations, let us
note that any map h(x) having the winding number w(h) = n can be decomposed as
h(x) = hn(x; l)h(x) using the representative map hn(x; l) and h(x) that has zero winding
it then follows from (3.3) that the factor eif [h] depends only on the winding
number.
number of h(x), and it is given by a unitary representation of the additive group zz,
namely, we have

phys[g(x)h(x)] = eiw(h)phys[g(x)],

(3.4)

with an arbitrary angle parameter   [0, 2). the energy eigenstates are obtained by
solving the schrodinger equation, h0(g, j) phys = e phys.

for convenience we may wish to use states which are invariant under all gauge trans-

formations. this can be accomplished by introducing

k(g) =

1

4 z dx tr t3(g1g ),

(3.5)

which transforms under gauge transformations (2.2) as k(gh) = k(g) + w(h). then the
desired states which are invariant even under large gauge transformations can be obtained
by

[g(x)] := eik phys[g(x)].

(3.6)

noting that j aeik = eik (j a + h
4 3abtr tb(g1g )), we see that the invariant states
[g(x)] obey the schrodinger equation in the form h(g, j)  = e , where h(g, j) =

r dx h is the modied hamiltonian with

h(g, j) =

(3.7)

one can put the above formulation of quantum theory in the path-integral formalism
by means of the standard faddeev-popov prescription (see, e.g., [10]), where one introduces
a gauge xing condition (g, j)  0 corresponding to the constraint (g, j)  0 in (2.8)
and considers the partition function in phase space,

z = z dg dj ()() | det{, }| exp(cid:20) i

h z d2x(cid:0)tr j(g1 g)  h(cid:1)(cid:21) ,

(3.8)

with dg dj = qx,t[tr (g1dg)3qa dj a]. choosing the gauge xing condition to be j-

independent (g, j) = (g), and noting that {, } gives the innitesimal gauge trans-
formation , one can carry out the j-integrations to get the conguration space path-
integral,

z = z dg () | det | exp(cid:20) i

h z d2x(cid:18)l0(g) 

h
8

 tr t3(g1 g)(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(3.9)

the rst term l0(g) in the exponent of the path-integral is the lagrangian (2.4), whereas
the second term is just the soliton term lsoliton in (1.3) as can be readily conrmed upon
it is also obvious that the path-integral measure dg () | det | must be
using (2.1).
the same as the measure dn for the eld n(x, t).
indeed, we can see this explicitly if
we employ the euler angle decomposition4 g = et3 et2 et3 for which the measure reads

dg = q sin  d d d = ddn, and whereby choose (g) =  which has  = const.

we therefore arrive at

z = z dn exp(cid:20) i

h z d2x(cid:18) 1

22 (n)2 +

h
8

 abcnanb nc(cid:19) (cid:21) ,

(3.10)

which shows that the soliton term (1.3) is induced upon quantization in the o(3) nsm in
(1 + 1) dimensions.

4. the hopf term in n(x, t)

the hopf term (1.4) has been widely used in the physics literature especially in the
context of fractional spin and statistics in (2 + 1) dimensions. however, unlike the soliton
term in (1 + 1) dimensions, the hopf term is not well-dened mathematically for generic
congurations, and hence it requires a careful consideration before it is used. to examine
the problem in detail, we rst recall the hopf invariant used in mathematics (see, e.g., [11]).
let f be a map s3  s2 and f be a generator of the de rham cohomology h 2
dr(s2) = ri .

4 since the decomposition is possible only locally in su(2), for a more rigorous treatment one needs
to introduce a set of patches to cover the su(2). the obstruction for a nave global gauge xing is also
evident in that in terms of g the soliton term is a total divergence while in terms of n it is not.

7

since h 2
dr(s3) = 0 the pullback f f of f under the map f (i.e., f regarded as a 2-form on
s3) admits the form f f = da with some 1-form a on s3. the hopf invariant associated
to the map f is then given by

h(f ) := 

1

162 zs 3

a  da ,

(4.1)

where the normalization is chosen such that h(f )  zz when f is normalized as

rs 2 f  4zz. note that the topological invariant h(f ) in (4.1) is independent of the

choice of a.
gauge transformations a  a  d) and hence in the integrand in (4.1), the integral is
still uniquely determined. with an appropriately normalized f the hopf invariant h(f )
becomes an integer characterizing the map f .

evidently, if our vector eld n can be regarded as a map s3  s2 with s3 our
(eective) spacetime, then by identifying n with the above f and also 1
2 f dx  dx with
the 2-form f f , the integral of the hopf term (1.4) over the spacetime s3 becomes identical
to (4.1) up to an overall constant and, therefore, it is well-dened. however, the boundary
condition in space (1.2) implies that we shall be considering the nsm in a spacetime of
the form m = s2  i where i is a time interval, say, i = [0, t ], or m = s2  s1 if an
additional periodic boundary condition in time is imposed. thus in general our map is
given by n : m  s2 with these m , for which we have h 2
dr(m ) 6= 0. accordingly, there
is no guarantee to nd such (globally dened) a satisfying nf = da to a given map n.
in other words, the nave integral,

i(a; m ) := 

1

162 zm

a  da,

(4.2)

cannot be used for providing the topological term we want. at this point one may think
that a solution is to regard a as a u (1) connection over the base space m , that is, to nd
a given locally on patches which are introduced to trivialize the bre bundle. that this
does not work can be seen as follows.

suppose m is covered by two local patches, m1 and m2, on which we have a 1-form
a1 and a2, respectively, satisfying nf = daa for a = 1, 2. one then may consider,
instead of (4.2), the sum of integrals5

i(a1; m1) + i(a2; m2)  i(a1; m1  m2).

(4.3)

5 one can also use a2 instead of a1 in the last term, and this creates another ambiguity in dening

the topological term.

8

this is, however, not invariant under gauge transformations aa  aa  da performed
separately on the patches with 1 and 2 chosen independently, because its variation,
1da1 plus contributions from other two terms, does not vanish for generic a. (the
gauge noninvariance of the conventional hopf term has been pointed out earlier in [12].)

rm1

actually, this is a problem with the chern-simons term in gauge theory (rather than with

the hopf term in the nsm), where it is assumed that the connection a is globally dened

[13], which is enough if one is interested in the perturbative analysis of the theory. the real

problem with the hopf term is that in the o(3) nsm this assumption excludes solitons

or anti-solitons unless the total charge vanishes, which are considered to be responsible

for physical phenomena of our interest such as fractional spin. indeed, for the spacetime
m = s2  i (or m = s2  s1) the assumption amounts to the requirement that the 2-form
nf be a trivial element of h 2

dr(m ) and, therefore, we nd that the soliton charge,

q(n) := 

1

4 zs 2

nf ,

(4.4)

becomes q(n) = (1/4)rs 2 da = 0, that is, the map n must belong to the sector where

the soliton charge vanishes.

conversely, it is possible to show that the restriction to the sector q(n) = 0 is sucient

for the topological term to be well-dened in the nsm. for this, we rst note that, for
a generic spacetime m , the condition h 2
dr(m ) = 0 is not still enough for ensuring the
integral (4.2) to be well-dened, because the gauge invariance of the integral (4.2) requires

that the 1-form a must in general be gauge-xed on m if m 6= 0. in quantum theory,
however, such a gauge xing is not necessary with our space time m = s2  i. the
reason for this is that, as is well-known, in quantum theory we can always place periodic
boundary conditions in time,6 and this allows us to put the time period i into s1 and
thereby remove the boundary of the spacetime. we then notice that if the aforementioned

restriction to the q(n) = 0 sector is made in the nsm, we can deform any map n(x) at
t = 0 and t continuously to the constant map n(x) = n0 without changing the integral
in (4.2) (since we have (s2  s1) = 0). this procedure allows us to regard n as a map
s3  s2 by shrinking the space s2 to a point at the both ends of time and, consequently,

6 this is easily realized in the path-integral for a particle, where one needs to dene a relative phase to a
given pair of paths, rather than to dene an absolute phase to each path, in order to provide the transition
amplitude. the relative phase between a pair of two paths obeying the same boundary conditions at t = 0
and t can be regarded as the phase attached to the path given by connecting the two paths (with the
time of one of the paths reversed). this amounts to dening a phase to an arbitrary loop which is a path
possessing the same initial and nal points.

9

the integral in (4.2), which is just the hopf invariant (4.1), can be used as a topological
term in the model.7

5. the hopf term in g(x, t)

the foregoing argument shows that there are basically three obstacles for the nave
integral i(a; m ) in (4.2) to be well-dened as the topological term associated with the
hopf invariant (4.1). these obstacles are related to the conditions that the term be (i)
well-dened as an integral over the spacetime m , (ii) a topological invariant, and (iii) gauge
invariant. as we shall see shortly, in the aop the situation concerning these conditions
turns out to be quite dierent, and we shall exploit it in order to dene the topological
term to any congurations, fullling all the three conditions.

to this end, we rst note that the corresponding f becomes then the 2-form on the
target of the map g : d2  i  su (2)  s3, and it is given by f = trt3(g1dg)2. since
dr(d2  i) = 0 we always have a 1-form a such that the pullback of f under g becomes
h 2
g f = da  an obvious solution is a = trt3(g1dg). thus we now have a local in the
variable g in contrast to the previous a which is nonlocal in n. accordingly, in the aop
the integral (4.2) turns into the local expression [7],

i(a; m ) = i(g) :=

1

482 z m

tr(g1dg)3 ,

(5.1)

where now m = d2 i, and this shows that condition (i) is fullled. in passing we mention
that, on account of the boundary condition (2.3), the aop version of the soliton charge
(4.4) reads

q(g) := 

1

4 zd2

g f = 

1

4 zd2

trt3(g1dg) ,

(5.2)

which gives the winding number of the map k : d2  s1  u (1) at space innity.

let us now observe that, when the spacetime m for g can be regarded as d2  s1
as can be done in the path-integral, the integral (5.1) becomes a topological invariant
irrespective of the soliton sector we are in. indeed, under an arbitrary variation g  g + g
we obtain

i(g + g)  i(g) =

trg1g(g1dg)2 ,

(5.3)

1

162 z m

which vanishes for any g which are assumed to be of the form (2.3) at  m = d2  s1 and
hence (g1dg)2| m = (k1dk)2| m = 0. however, the problem is that i(g) is not invariant

7 in the literature [2, 3, 4, 14] the term (4.2) is considered even for sectors with nonzero soliton numbers
under the coulomb gauge. however, as has been pointed out in [6], the fractional spin evaluated directly
from the term becomes gauge dependent and physically unacceptable.

10

under time-dependent gauge transformations (2.2) possessing nontrivial winding numbers
along s1. this can be conrmed directly by observing

i(gh)  i(g) = 

1

162 z m

tr(k1dk)  (dh h1) .

(5.4)

to evaluate the r.h.s. of (5.4), let l be the length of the boundary d2  s1 and regard the
domain of the integral  m = s1  s1 as the rectangle i 2 = [0, l]  [0, t ] in which periodic
boundary conditions are imposed on the maps k and h.
introducing the coordinates
(x, t)  i 2, we put

k(x, t) = e(x,t)t3 hm(x; l) hl(t; t ) ,

h(x, t) = e(x,t)t3 hn(t; t ) ,

(5.5)

where (x, t) and (x, t) are periodic functions in i 2, hm(x; l), hl(t; t ), hn(t; t ) are the
representative maps dened earlier with m, n, l  zz. note that the integer m in k(x, t)
equals (minus) the soliton number q(g), whereas for h(x, t) no such integer appears since
we have q(h) = 0 on account of the fact that for gauge transformations h must be given
on d2 which is contractible. substituting (5.5) into (5.4) we nd

i(gh)  i(g) = (cid:18) 1

162(cid:19)(cid:18) 4n

t (cid:19)(cid:18) 4m

l (cid:19)zi 2

dx  dt = n q(g) ,

(5.6)

that is, condition (iii) is not fullled unless q(g) = 0.

in order to extend the domain of i(g) to nonvanishing soliton number sectors, a
possible procedure proposed in [6] is that one imposes a (partial) gauge xing condition
on g(x, t) such that at spatial innity it become time-independent, i.e.,


t

g(x, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)d2

= 0 .

(5.7)

indeed, this excludes those gauge transformations by h(x, t) having n 6= 0 on d2, and
hence the r.h.s. of (5.6) vanishes irrespective of the soliton charge q(g). thus we see that,
upon imposing (5.7), the integral i(g) denes a topological invariant and, at the same
time, it is gauge invariant for any g.
it remains, therefore, to nd the meaning of the
topological invariant so dened.

for this, let us consider the conguration,

g(x, t) := g0 g1(x, 0) g(x, t) .

(5.8)

using the additivity of the soliton number, q(g1g2) = q(g1) + q(g1) for any g1, g2 obeying
(2.3), we nd that q(g) = 0. thus we are allowed to regard g as one converted from g

figure 1. the physical picture of the conversion procedure. given a soliton
conguration, which evolves in time and is shown on the right, the procedure puts
a static anti-soliton on the left in a distance far from the soliton, so that the
entire soliton charge vanishes. the hopf number will be gained by the dynamical
evolution of the soliton.

to the vanishing soliton number sector, for which the integral i(g) in (5.1) gives the hopf
invariant without imposing (5.7). on the other hand, it can be readily shown [6] that, once
the condition (5.7) is imposed, the conversion does not change the integral, i(g) = i(g).
it thus follows that the topological invariant dened above for any g with (5.7) is nothing
but the hopf invariant for the converted conguration g.

note that conversion to the vanishing soliton number sector is far from unique. how-

ever, since the integral (5.1) is a topological invariant, any conversion of the form,

g(x, t) := ga(x) g(x, t) ,

(5.9)

gives the same value for i(g) as long as the static conguration ga has the soliton number
opposite to that of g so that q(g) = 0 (and we may also require ga|d2 = 1 so that g
still obeys (2.3)). this observation allows for the following physical interpretation to the
topological invariant we just assigned to g. suppose that the original conguration g(x, t)
has soliton number n, and that it is localized in some nite domain in space. choose
then ga(x) such that it has soliton number (n) and also localized in some other domain
which do not intersect with the domain of g. then what the conversion (5.9) is doing is
that it places a static anti-soliton ga somewhere far from the soliton g. roughly speaking,
the hopf invariant counts the number of twists made by the conguration during the

12

time interval [0, t ], and for g these twists are performed by the soliton part. the static
anti-soliton does not play a role in this, except that it provides a ground in which the
hopf invariant becomes well-dened by nullifying the soliton charge (see fig. 1). in fact,
the physical picture originally used by wilczek and zee [1] to discuss fractional spin (for
the case n = 1) is the initial soliton/anti-soliton pair creation and annihilation at the
nal time, which is the case where the conversion is made according to (5.8) for a soliton
g(x, t) which stays far from the static anti-soliton ga(x) = g1(x, 0) except when the
creation and annihilation take place at t = 0 and t = t , respectively. our procedure
presented here provides a mathematical ground for the picture, in the light of nding a
well-dened topological invariant corresponding to the hopf invariant. we also point out
that it is possible to carry out the procedure in the original description in terms of n, but
it becomes more involved than the one given here which exploits fully the advantage of the
group properties of the aop.

6. conclusion and discussions

in this paper we discussed two types of topological terms in the o(3) nsm, one is the
soliton term in (1 + 1) dimensions and the other is the hopf term in (1 + 1) dimensions.
in contrast to the soliton term which is well-dened and can be derived from the unitary
representation of the fundamental group of the conguration space c1, the hopf term
used in the literature is ill-dened and, against the general expectation, it cannot serve
to produce fractional spin and statistics in its conventional form. we argued that the
conversion procedure, which has been proposed earlier to make the hopf term well-dened
and is equivalent to a partial gauge xing in the aop, is natural both mathematically and
physically.

once we constructed the hopf term as a topological invariant associated with the rst
homotopy group (1.5), we may ask if it can also be used as a wess-zumino term in the
(1 + 1)-dimensional nsm. this possibility arises from the fact that the second homotopy
group of the conguration space c1 reads

2(c1) = 3(s2) = zz,

(6.1)

which suggests that the nsm may admit an associated topological term analogous to the
wess-zumino term in the wess-zumino-novikov-witten model [15] which has the same
second homotopy group. in fact, the usual wess-zumino term is given precisely by the
integral (5.1) with m = d3 whose boundary m  s2 is identied with the (1 + 1)-
dimensional spacetime. since in the nsm the second homotopy group is related to the

13

hopf bration, we may expect that the topological term is again the hopf term we have
just made well-dened.

to examine this possibility, for deniteness we take our spacetime to be s2, which is
always possible since by (1.6) there is no obstacle to deform any congurations to a constant
one. we however observe that taking the extrapolated manifold m = d3 for our wess-
zumino term (4.2) is not possible, because a loop in c1 given by the spacetime map n(x, t)
cannot always be deformed to a point due to (1.5), unlike in the wess-zumino-novikov-
witten model where it can. instead, we may consider m = s2i parameterized by (x, t, )
with the extrapolation parameter   [0, 1] in such a way that the map n(x, t, 1) := n(x, t)
be extended to n(x, t, 0) given by some xed conguration possessing the same soliton
number as n(x, t). this does not render the integral (4.2) well-dened either, since the
integral changes under gauge transformations for a yielding a gauge dependent integral
over the spacetime s2. the situation is unaltered even if we take any three-dimensional
manifold for m as long as it contains s2 in the boundary m , which is a quality requisite
to a wess-zumino term in (1 + 1) dimensions. we also note that, despite the similarity
of the present problem with that of dening the hopf term in (2 + 1) dimensions, the
procedure we adopted in the aop cannot be employed here, because one cannot use the
periodic boundary condition in the direction of the extrapolating parameter , as done in
the previous case where the role of  is played by the time t.

finally, we mention that the construction of gauge invariant topological terms as a
wess-zumino term has also been discussed elsewhere [16] in the context of coset models,
where the list of cohomology generators of a symmetric space g/h is exhausted. however,
this amounts to nding a local gauge invariant integrand such as f  f or f  f , rather
than directly seeking for a gauge invariant integral as we did above without assuming the
locality and gauge invariance of its integrand. the conclusion of the non-existence of such
a term, however, remains the same.
