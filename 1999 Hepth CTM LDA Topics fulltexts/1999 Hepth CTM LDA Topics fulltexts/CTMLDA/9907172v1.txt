abstract

we calculate the casimir energy of the rotating nambu-goto string with the gauss-

bonnet term in the action and point-like masses at the ends. this energy turns out to be

negative for every values of the parameters of the model.

it seems to exist a common belief that the construction of (even approximate) string repre-

sentation of qcd could be crucial for understanding nonperturbative properties of quantum

chromodynamics, such as the nature of the ground state or mechanism of connement. the

conjecture of existence of such a description is supported by a number of facts [1, 2], to mention

only the nature of the 1/nc expansion [3], success of the dual models in description of regge

phenomenology, area connement law found in the strong coupling lattice expansion [4] or the

existence of uxline solutions in conning gauge theories [5, 6] and the analytical results con-

cerning twodimensional qcd [7]. the results obtained recently in the framework of m theory

are also very promising (see, for instance, [8]).

it is well known that the simplest, nambugoto string model [9], when treated as a quantum

system, has many drawbacks [10, 11] which include the nonphysical dimension of the space

time (d=26) or tachion and unwanted massless states in the spectrum. it is therefore reasonable

to study modications of the nambugoto model, and among them the simplest ones, which

preserve the equations of motion for the interior of the string while changing the boundary

conditions imposed at the string ends.

the model we investigate in this letter is dened through the action functional

here , with the dimension (mass)2, is the string tension,  is a dimensionless parameter and
g = detgab is the determinant of the induced metric tensor gab = ax bx (a, b = , ). r, the

inner curvature scalar, can be written in the form

r = (cid:16)gabgcd  gadgbc(cid:17)abxccx ,

where a is a covariant (with respect to the induced metric gab) derivative. partial analysis of
classical solutions of the model specied by (1) was performed in [12].

the inclusion of the gaussbonnet term

sgb = z 2

d g r

into the action (1) is a rather natural construction in the context of the eective qcd string.
the qcd string action should contain  apart from the x  elds  also innitely many elds

describing for instance the transverse shape of the chromoelectric ux joining the color sources.

in constructing the eective string action, one integrates over such a elds and this procedure

inevitably leads to emergence of the intrinsic curvature term in the action functional. of course, it

is then only the rst one out of the innitely many terms with the growing number of derivatives.

invariant conditions [10]:

( x  x )2 = 0,

q2,

(2)

(3)

where the dot and the prime mean dierentiation with respect to  and  and q is a parame-

ter with the dimension of mass. the appearance of this parameter can be traced back to the

assumption, that  takes values in the xed interval [0, ].

it can be shown (for details see [10, 13, 14]), that in this parametrization every solution of the

string equations of motion and boundary conditions, following from the action (1), corresponds

to the solution of the complex liouville equation [15]:

   = 2q2e,

the correspondence is explicitly established through the relations:

(7)

(8)

where fl,r are arbitrary complex functions which give single valued  satisfying the boundary

conditions (5).

a distinguished class of solutions of the liouville equation (4) is composed of static, i.e.

 independent elds. they are of the form

e0 =

(10)

following from the boundary conditions (5) for the liouville eld of the form (9).

the liouville eld 0 describes a straight string which rotates with a constant angular

velocity in some plane and by choosing a convenient reference frame we can write the string

coordinates in a form

x  =

q

2(cid:16), cos  sin(  d), sin  sin(  d), 0(cid:17).

(11)

let us note, that in the presence of the inner curvature term in the action (1) the velocities

of the string ends,

v1 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
v2 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= | sin(  d)|,

(12)

remain smaller than the the velocity of light even in the limit of vanishing masses mi = 0.

for xed values of the external parameters ,  and mis this is in fact a family of solutions,

parameterized by the value of q. by increasing q we increase the string length,

(14)

in order to calculate the casimir energy of the rotating string we have to nd the frequencies

of small oscillations around this conguration. if we write

(, ) = 0(, ) + 1(, ),

where 0 is given by (9) and 1 is assumed to be small, then from (4) we get the equation

general solution of the equation (16) satisfying the conditions (17) is

(18)

where

n are positive roots of the equation

tan n =

d()  2 sin    [tan d + tan(  d)] cos   2 tan d tan(  d) sin  = 0,

(19)

excluding 0 =  and an, n are arbitrary, real constants.

it is convenient to introduce the abbreviations

 =  tan(  d),

 =  tan d,

what allows to rewrite

d() = (cid:16)2  (cid:17) sin   ( + ) cos .

using eqs. (68) one checks that the liouville eld 1 described a set of decoupled string

oscillations with frequencies

n =

the casimir energy is dened as a (appropriately regularised and renormalized) sum

we choose to work with the  function regularization (let us stress, however, that the nal result

is independent of the chosen regularization method  for instance, the cut-o regularization gives

the same ultimate formulae) and dene after [16]

and the parameter  with dimension of mass is introduced to ensure that the r.h.s. of the

expression (22) has the dimension of energy for arbitrary complex s. the physically interesting
value s = 1 is obtained from (23) through the analytic continuation.

the analicity of the function d(z) allows to deform the integration contour c1 into c2 and,

after a straightforward calculation, one arrives at the formula

where  is also an arbitrary, but now dimensionless constant.

following [17, 18] we interpret terms in the rst square bracket in eq. (25) as renormalising

the classical string mass. this is also supported by the expectation, that the casimir energy

should vanish for innitely long strings, while the discussed terms fail to satisfy this condition.

our nal expression for the casimir energy thus reads

ecas =

0.1, m2 = 0.2 (dotted line). all dimensionful quantities in the system of units  = 1.

for every values of masses m1, m2 and the parameters ,  the casimir energy (26) is negative.

for long strings (l  ) formula (26) gives

this is dierent from the celebrated lusher term [19],

but the reasons are obvious. first, lusher term is derived for the string with xed ends and the

oscillation frequencies equal

,

while in our, rotating string case we have

n(l  ) =

2n

.

second, in considered model we have only planar oscillations and this gives additional factor

1/2.
