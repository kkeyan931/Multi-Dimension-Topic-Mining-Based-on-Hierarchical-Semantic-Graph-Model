abstract

in this paper we continue the study of the non-critical type 0 string
and its eld theory duals. we begin by reviewing some facts and
conjectures about these theories. we move on to our proposal for
the type 0 eective action in any dimension, its rr elds and their
chernsimons couplings. we then focus on the case without compact
dimensions and study its eld theory duals. we show that one can
parameterize all dual physical quantities in terms of a nite number
of unknown parameters. by making some further assumptions on
the tachyon couplings, one can still make some model independent
statements.

this work is dedicated to the memory of mauri miettinen.

1 introduction

polyakovs proposal [1] of using type 0a/0b string theory for describing
non-supersymmetric yang-mills theories is a promising and novel attempt
at formulating the qcd string and provides an alternative way of extending
the ads/cft correspondence [2, 3, 4] beyond the realm of supersymmetric
eld theories.

simply put, the proposal postulates using a closed string theory in d 
10 space-time dimensions with world-sheet supersymmetry and a diagonal
gso projection that removes all space-time fermions, thus yielding a non-
supersymmetric theory in target space. one can refer to such theories for
which d < 10 as non-critical although the name can be confusing because
weyl invariance is recovered once the conformal factor of the world-sheet
metric is counted among the other space-time coordinates. throughout this
paper, d will always include such liouville mode and hence weyl invariance
is retained, at least at the lowest level in the sigma-model expansion.

so far, most of the literature following [1] has analyzed the most conser-
vative case of non-supersymmetric theories in d = 10 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. such
theories [11, 12] are often referred to as type 0a or 0b, depending on the
particular gso projection employed. their open string descendants were
analyzed in [13, 14, 15, 16].

however, it is our opinion that the non-critical scenario [17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22] must be taken seriously and will give rise to additional interesting
models that are not accessible at d = 10. throughout the paper we shall
continue to refer to these lower dimensional theories as type 0a or 0b in even
dimensions, depending on the choice of chirality in the gso projection. in
odd space-time dimensions there is only one such theory due to the lack of
chirality. we shall refer to it as type 0ab.

although the full conformal eld theory corresponding to the above non-
critical string theory has not yet been constructed, there are some indications
that such a construction is indeed possible:

consider the issue of modular invariance. dene the fermionic traces for

the pair of majoranaweyl fermions (z), (z) as4

z 0

0 ( ) = tr ns(cid:18)qn(cid:19)

0 ( ) = tr r(cid:18)qn(cid:19)
1 ( ) = tr r(cid:18)()f qn(cid:19).

z 1

(1)

in the ordinary type ii string theory in d dimensions, modular invariance
requires that the holomorphic contribution of the fermions to the partition
function

z 0
0 ( )(d2)/2  z 0

1 ( )(d2)/2  z 1

0 ( )(d2)/2  z 1

1 ( )(d2)/2

(2)

and the analogous antiholomorphic contribution be separately modular in-
variant up to an overall opposite phase.
it is well known that the lowest
dimension where the product of the holomorphic contribution and the anti-
holomorphic contribution is modular invariant is d = 10.

in type 0 theories, the joined contributions of the holomorphic and the

antiholomorphic sectors give rise to

|z 0

0 ( )|d2 + |z 0

1 ( )|d2 + |z 1

0 ( )|d2  |z 1

1 ( )|d2,

(3)

which is modular invariant for any d. of course, for d 6= 10 the explicit
expressions for the fermionic traces will be modied because of the changes
in the spectrum, but we view the above as an indication that the continuation
o-criticality is more likely to work for the type 0 string than for the usual
type ii.

another objection that needs to be addressed is the d = 2 barrier. let
us briey recall the physics behind this problem as presented e.g. in [23].
because we do not yet know how to describe rr elds at the level of the
sigma-model we are forced to discuss this argument in the case of the bosonic
theory. in this context it is well know that there exists an exact cft solution
in any d in which the only non-zero background elds are a at metric gm n ,
a linearly rising dilaton  and an exponential tachyon t

gm n = m n ,  = s 26  d

t = exp

(4)

for d  2 the background tachyon is exponentially rising, preventing the
string from entering the region of strong coupling. moreover, uctuations
around the tachyon background are stable and thus the theory is well dened.
on the contrary, for d > 2, the background tachyon oscillates. in principle
this could still act as a cuto for the string coupling but the uctuations have
some negative frequency square modes and the theory becomes unstable.

as stressed in [1, 24] we should not think of the d = 2 barrier as a no-go
theorem but rather as an indication that solutions for d > 2 will necessarily
involve a curved space-time metric. this is the type of situation that is
of interest in the connection with gauge theory so, in a sense, it is to be
expected that at space-time be ruled out. unfortunately, we do not yet
have an example of an exact cft of this type and we are forced to work
order by order in  at the level of the eective action. but it should be clear
that there are no a priori reasons for why there should not exist an exact
solution.

a third encouraging sign comes from the analysis of the rr sector per-
formed in section 3. by making some plausible assumptions about the mass-
less degrees of freedom it is possible to construct a rather compelling picture
of the rr sectors in various dimensions and their couplings, including chern
simons terms. for instance, the necessity of doubling the rr spectrum in
d = 4 or d = 8 minkowski space-time is seen as coming from the fact that
there are no real self-dual forms in these dimensions.

finally, let us note that considering d < 10 from the sigma model point
of view is a very natural thing to do if the string theory has a perturbative
tachyon. the only way for a theory with a perturbative tachyon to make sense
is if there exists a mechanism through which the tachyon eld condenses by
acquiring a vacuum expectation value. the tachyon potential at that point
will then give rise to a tree-level contribution to the cosmological constant
by shifting the central charge. since the eective central charge is going to
be dierent from zero anyway5, one is led to consider the theory with the
most general value for the eective central charge

ce. = 10  d

v(cid:18)hti(cid:19).

(5)

from the target space point of view this acts as a contribution to the cosmo-

5it seems unnatural and there is no symmetry argument for which the tachyon potential

should vanish at that point.

logical constant and thus shows that, for d > 2, one should look at curved
space-times.

none of the above points constitute a proof that conformally invariant
solutions to the type 0a/b string exist for arbitrary d but we view them
as strong indications that such construction is possible. having taken this
as our basic assumption, throughout the paper we work at the level of the
eective action to one loop in , i.e. the gravity level without higher order
corrections.

the form of the action of the type 0 gravity, can be determined perturba-
tively, with a certain number of ambiguities involving the tachyon potential
and the coupling to the rr elds, which are essentially there because of
lack of supersymmetry on the target space. however, supersymmetry on the
world sheet allows one to make some statements on these terms, as we will
see in section 3. we will stay generic and will be able to show that in any
dimension there exists a set of exact solutions of the classical equations of
motion, which give ads metric and involve a non-zero rr eld, other than
constant dilaton and tachyon. such solutions depend only on a nite number
of parameters for which a string-theoretical derivation is still lacking.

the solutions found represent polyakovs conformal xed points in the
dual gauge theory  they support a condensed tachyon, but the rst issue
to be addressed is the stability against quantum uctuations of the elds.
because of the mixing of several of these elds it is not enough to analyze
the tachyon itself, one has to disentangle the full set of uctuations [25].
for simplicity, we restrict to the case where the space is d-dimensional ads,
so that there are no kk modes to be worried about. there the analysis
simplies considerably, but it is still non trivial because of dilaton-tachyon
mixing.

another issue that was raised in [1] is the eld theory interpretation of
these solutions. there it was claimed that they may represent an interacting
uv conformal point. to address this issue one needs to show that these
gravity solutions represent in fact a point in wider space, that is actually the
rg phase diagram of the eld theories we have at hand. in this enlarged
theory space there may be more than one conformal solution and there exist
trajectories which interpolate between these points.

these considerations have already been realized in the framework of type
iib supergravity, where the rg ow is believed to be driven by operators
dual to scalar elds coming from kk reduction in the compact directions [26,

4

27, 28, 29], or by the running of the dilaton [30, 31, 32]. it turns out that
type 0 gravity provides an example of this general feature of the ads/cft
correspondence, as well. in fact, the physics is already captured by the set
of solutions involving no compact space. even without including kk modes,
the tachyon will mix with the dilaton eld, and generate on the eld theory
side a rg ow that connects interacting conformal xed points.

2 a look at the type 0a/b theory in d = 10

in this section we briey summarize some known facts about the perturbative
properties of these theories. we will thus set d = 10 throughout this section
and consider perturbation theory around the (unstable) vacuum. we will,
however, point out the various places where modications occur when one is
considering d 6= 10. we will return to these changes in section 3 where we
present the detailed structure of the rr terms in d  10.
in the notation of [23], there are (up to equivalences) only four consistent
ways of combining the various sectors of the n = (1, 1) nsr closed oriented
string in d = 10:

iia :
iib :
0a :
0b :

(ns+, ns+)  (ns+, r+)  (r, ns+)  (r+, r)
(ns+, ns+)  (ns+, r+)  (r+, ns+)  (r+, r+)
(ns+, ns+)  (ns, ns)  (r+, r)  (r, r+)
(ns+, ns+)  (ns, ns)  (r+, r+)  (r, r). (6)
the rst two are the usual type iia/b superstring and the last two are those
of interest here. the massless elds of the theory are the dilaton , graviton
gm n and two-form bm n coming from the (ns+, ns+) sector and twice as
many rr elds coming from the doubled rr sectors. there is a tachyon t
from the (ns, ns) and no fermionic mode at all. all other modes are
massive.

2.1 selection rules for d = 10

the lack of space-time fermions means that the theory has no space-time
supersymmetry; however, the presence of n = (1, 1) world-sheet supersym-
metry has the following simplifying features [5]:

5

a) all tree-level correlators involving an odd number of tachyons and only
(ns+, ns+) vertex operators are zero. this can be seen from the ex-
plicit form of the vertex operators. the vertex operator for the massless
(ns+, ns+) states and for the tachyon in the (ns, ns) sector are,
again in the notation of [23]

(n s+,n s+) = (ix m + k   m )(i x n + k   n ) eikx
v 0,0
(n s+,n s+) = e  m n eikx
v 1,1
(n s,n s) = k   k   eikx
v 0,0
(n s,n s) = e  eikx.
v 1,1

(7)

since on the sphere we need to take any two of the above in the (1,1)
picture and all the rest in the (0, 0) picture it is clear that we will always
end up with the correlation function of an odd number of s which
vanishes. in particular, notice that in this vacuum hti = 0 whereas we
expect a tachyon condensate in the true vacuum.

b) all tree-level correlators involving an odd number of tachyons, any
number of elds from the (ns+, ns+) and two rr elds from the
same sector must vanish. for instance,
if the amplitude with one
tachyon did not vanish there would be a tachyon pole in some tree-level
correlation function of the corresponding type ii theory. the vanishing
of the amplitude can also be seen at the level of the correlation func-
tions of the vertex operators. we can always use the vertex operators
for the rr elds in the (1/2,1/2) picture  written as a bispinor it
reads
(8)

(r,r) = e/2 /2   eikx .
v 1/2,1/2

in a correlator that involves two such vertex operators, one remaining
(ns, ns) vertex (7) needs to be taken in the (1,1) picture
yielding an overall even number of s. schematically, this part of the
correlator is proportional to c2n and only connects spinors of opposite
chirality because the charge conjugation matrix c anticommutes with
the chirality matrix . this is also true in d = 6 whereas in d = 4
and d = 8 the opposite is true, since now the matrix c commutes with
. hence, in d = 4 and d = 8 we expect to nd a coupling between an
odd number of tachyons and rr elds from the same sector and none

6

between an odd number of tachyons and rr elds from the opposite
sector.

c) the reverse statement holds for an even number of tachyons (in partic-
ular no tachyon at all). the correlators will now involve an odd number
of s and these vanish in d = 10 between spinors of opposite chirality.
again, it is natural to expect that such a statement will hold in d = 6
and be reversed in d = 4 and d = 8.

for odd space-time dimensions, both statements b) and c) are empty due
to the lack of chirality and we do not expect any particular symmetry of the
couplings. statement c) is also consistent with the fact that in d = 10 all
correlation functions between (ns+, ns+) elds and elds from one given
rr sector are the same as in type ii theory, which is obvious because the
vertex operators and their correlation functions are precisely the same and
there is no loop in which other modes could propagate.
in particular, it
indicates that there are chernsimons terms in the eective action and that
the various eld strengths need to be modied by shifting them with a bm n
dependent transformation just as in type ii supergravity. it seems natural
to postulate that such terms will be present also in lower dimensions in the
cases where they are allowed by the symmetries of the problem.

these simple properties and some explicit tree-level computations [5] al-
low one to write down, for the critical case, to rst non-trivial order in ,
an eective action up to terms quadratic in the gauge elds. below we shall
present our proposed generalization of this action in any dimension including
chernsimons terms.

2.2 d-branes in the d = 10 theory

we conclude this section with a look at the type of d-branes in this theory [16,
33]. in this subsection we always work in d = 10.

due to the doubling of the rr elds, there are twice as many d-branes
as in the corresponding type ii theory. let us denote by f and f  the rr
elds from the two rr sectors of (6) respectively6. for a given p we have
6we refrain from using the notation f and f used in [5] because we reserve such
notation for the d = 4 and d = 8 case where such elds are complex conjugate of each
other.

7

thus four types of elementary branes (counting the anti-branes) with charges
(q = 1, q = 1), (q = 1, q = 1), (q = 1, q = 1), (q = 1, q =
1). branes charged only with respect to, say, f are possible but carry
charge (q = 2n, q = 0) in these units and thus can be built from the four
constituents above.

a quick way to understand the spectrum of massless excitations living on
the world-volume of a stack of such branes is to consider the closed string
exchange between two such branes, perform a modular transformation and
read o the spectrum from the open string sector.

let us denote the usual open string traces in the various sectors as7

where, as usual,

f1(q)!8
tr ns(cid:18)qn(cid:19) =  f3(q)
f1(q)!8
tr ns(cid:18)()f qn(cid:19) =  f4(q)
f1(q)!8
tr r(cid:18)qn(cid:19) =  f2(q)

,

f1(q) = q1/12(1  q2n)
f2(q) = 2q1/12(1 + q2n)
f3(q) = q1/24(1 + q2n1)
f4(q) = q1/24(1  q2n1).

(9)

(10)

the closed string exchange can be written in terms of these functions by
making a modular transformation q = et  q = e/t = et. let us
denote by h the light-cone oscillator part of the closed string hamiltonian,
and use the boundary states |bi to denote the branes (cf. [34, 35] for a
complete discussion of the boundary state formalism). let us also introduce
the shorthand notation

[ns+, ns+] = hb|eth|bi(n s+,n s+),

(11)

7we use the symbol tr to denote the sum over all eight transverse bosonic and fermionic

components, to distinguish it from the trace tr in (1).

8

and similar expressions for the other sectors. then, after a modular trans-
formation:

[ns, ns] 

[r, r]

2 (cid:18)tr ns(cid:18)qn(cid:19)  tr r(cid:18)qn(cid:19)(cid:19) =

!

(12)

(13)

all rr sectors give the same contribution.

there are three elementary cases to consider. first, consider the case of
two like-like charged branes (q1 = 1, q
2 = 1). let us
consider the type 0b case for denitiveness; all considerations apply to the
type 0a case as well. in this case we have the following situation:

1 = 1) and (q2 = 1, q

[ns+, ns+] + [ns, ns] + [r+, r+] + [r, r] 

f3(q)8  f4(q)8

f1(q)8

.

(14)
from (14) we read o, with the wisdom of [36, 37], that the world-sheet
theory has no tachyon, no fermions, and the same massless bosons as pure
d = 10 yang-mills theory dimensionally reduced to p + 1 dimensions.

second, consider the case (q1 = 1, q

1 = 1) and (q2 = 1, q

2 = 1). here

the exchange is

[ns+, ns+]  [ns, ns] + [r+, r+]  [r, r]  

f2(q)8
f1(q)8 .

(15)

perhaps the only subtlety is the minus sign in front of the (ns, ns)
exchange. this sign is xed by looking at the coupling of the tachyon to
the branes and noticing [5] that it has a coupling constant proportional to
the product of the charges of the brane, thus yielding q1q
2 = 1.
from (15) we see that this brane conguration has only fermions on the
world-volume. these two congurations were studied in [7].

1  q2q

finally the brane/anti-brane case is given by (q1 = 1, q

1 = 1) and

9

(q2 = 1, q

2 = 1) and corresponds to

[ns+, ns+] + [ns, ns]  [r+, r+]  [r, r] 

f3(q)8 + f4(q)8

f1(q)8

.

(16)
there is an open string tachyon in this theory, just as in [38, 39], signaling
an instability of the theory.

3 type 0 eective actions, ramondramond

elds and chernsimons terms

in this section we present our proposal for the eective action of type 0 string
theory in any dimension including the chernsimons couplings. lacking a
formulation from prime principles, the identication of the rr sectors
and their couplings requires a certain amount of guesswork. the picture
that emerges, however,
is quite simple and satisfying. we shall see, for
instance, that it gives support to the idea that the rr sectors must be
doubled compared to the type ii string.

3.1 the ns-ns sector

the ns-ns sector is common to all of these theories and can in principle
be obtained from a sigma-model approach. it involves the massless elds of
the (ns+, ns+) sector (a dilaton , a graviton gm n and an antisymmetric
tensor bm n ) and a tachyon t from the (ns, ns) sector. the tachyon
potential v (t ) is an even function from the property a) of the previous
section [5]. the relevant action is thus, in the string frame

sn sn s = z ddx g(cid:26)e2(cid:18)r 
2|dt|2  v (t )(cid:19)(cid:27) ,
(17)
where it is natural to absorb the central charge decit 10d into the denition
of the tachyon potential, i.e.

1
12|db|2 + 4|d|2

v (t ) = 10 + d 

d  2

(18)

it should be kept in mind that (17) is by no means unique. it suers from
the usual ambiguities that come from extrapolating on-shell data. in partic-
ular, there could be arbitrary (even) functions of t multiplying the various
kinetic terms in the lagrangian. up to this order in  this is essentially all
that can happen8. as shown in the appendix a of [5] however, precisely be-
cause of their ambiguous nature it is possible to redene away some of them,
such as the term rt 2. at the same time, terms of the type t 2|db|2 and their
counterpart for the rr kinetic terms are needed and should be kept. in the
following we will never need the eld bm n and we will set the coecients of
r, |d|2 and |dt|2 as in (17), the main conclusions being independent of the
presence of such terms.

3.2 rr kinetic and chernsimons terms

one guiding principle [21] in the identication of the rr sector is the idea
that for any d there will still be massless excitations in the r sector of the
open string and thus their on-shell degrees of freedom will fall into repre-
sentations of the little group so(d  2). the resulting situation is best
summarized in the table below.
in ten dimensions one obtains massless rr elds in the type 0a theory
by considering tensor products of spinors of dierent chiralities (+) and
(+), and in the 0b theory of same chiralities (++) and (). this can
be readily generalized for any non-critical even dimension, whereas it is not
quite clear what the right generalization to odd dimensions is. note, however,
that an odd dimensional bispinor can be decomposed in terms of the lower
even dimensional bispinors as (++)  (+)  (+)  (), and that this
is the sum of the eld contents of the 0a and the 0b theories of one lower
dimension. it thus seems reasonable to assume that a sum of two modular
invariant sectors should yield a modular invariant theory in one dimension
higher without doubling the rr spectrum by hand9.

8things become even more complex at the next order in   for instance there could

be terms of the type t 2nrmn m t n t .

9a dierent point of view was taken in [21]. it will be interesting to nd a resolution

to this puzzle.

to understand the table consider for example d = 8.

in the type 0b
theory, the bispinor in the (r+, r+) sector decomposes into 4 4 = 6 + 10.
these are all complex representations that yield a complex vector and a
complex three form with a self dual eld strength. notice that it is possible
to construct a self dual form in d = 8 only if it is complex because 2 = 1.
the bispinor in the (r, r) sector yields the complex conjugate elds.
these two sets of elds can be combined into two real one-forms and one
real three-form without any duality constraint. these are the elds written
in the last column.

notice that in odd dimensions we have only one version of the theory
(0ab) without the restriction on the rank of the forms. in even dimensions
the forms come in even or odd rank depending on the rr projection.
in
d = 10 and d = 6 the assignment is the familiar one (odd forms for type a
and even for type b) whereas in d = 8 and d = 4 it is reversed. of course,
it is possible to dualize some of the elds to obtain the magnetically charged

12

branes. the unique form of degree d/2  1 for the type 0b case admits both
electric and magnetic charges.
notice that if it were not for the doubling of the rr sectors it would be
impossible to write o-shell real elds for the 0b theory in d = 4 and d = 8
because, due to the minkowski signature, it is impossible to impose either
self-duality or anti-self-duality on real forms. we view this fact, together with
the argument based on modular invariance, as yet another piece of evidence
for the necessity of the presence of both rr sectors.

to obtain the complete form of the rr couplings up to two derivatives we
need to address the issue of chernsimons terms. the terms of relevance here
are those constructed with 3 gauge elds and 2 derivatives. despite the lack
of space-time supersymmetry, the chernsimons terms are present, at least
in d = 10, because they are there in the type ii theories. it thus seems that
the presence of these terms is dictated more by world-sheet supersymmetry
than by space-time supersymmetry and it is natural to assume that such
terms are also present in lower dimensions. the presence of so many rr
elds may seem to lead to diculties in determining these terms. however,
there are two simplifying features that we infer from the d = 10 case: first,
there will not be terms involving only rr elds since they correspond to
the correlation function of an odd number of spin elds. one of the three
gauge elds must therefore be the (ns+, ns+) two-form bm n . second,
applying the selection rules of the previous section, we see that the coupling
will involve elds from the same rr sector in d = 6 and d = 10 and from
the opposite sector in d = 4 and d = 8.

let us start with the case of d odd. in this case our proposal for the rr

part of the action is

s0ab

d=5 = z f (t )(f1  f1 + f2  f2) + bf1f2
d=7 = z f (t )(f1  f1 + f2  f2 + f3  f3) + bf2f3
d=9 = z f (t )(f1  f1 + f2  f2 + f3  f3 + f4  f4) + bf3f4. (19)

s0ab

the forms fn are the eld strengths associated to the rr gauge potentials.
in this section we use index free notation and redene the normalization
coecients to one in order not to clutter the formulas too much. a wedge
product between forms is always understood. the tilde above the forms

13

always indicates the ns-ns shift, e.g. f4 = f4 +bf2, with the appropriate
modied gauge transformation just as in type ii supergravity. notice that,
once it is assumed that the chernsimons terms are present, the modication
in the eld strength must also be present for the action to transform correctly
under electric/magnetic duality. f (t ) is a function of the tachyon whose
rst few coecients in the taylor expansion around zero can in principle be
determined by extrapolating from the on-shell computation [5] in d = 10.
we shall see that the detailed form of these functions is not directly relevant
for the computations of the properties of the dual eld theories.

to write the actions for the even dimensional cases, let us denote the eld
strengths from the two rr sectors by f, f  for d = 6 and d = 10 and by
f, f for d = 4 and d = 8. in the former case the eld strengths are real
whereas in the latter they are complex conjugates of each other. the form of
highest degree in the type 0b case is special  it is self dual in the complex
case and its vertex operator does not contain the chiral projection.

we present the form of the actions in all their generality because it will
be useful for future more detailed computations. for our present purposes
however, it should be noticed that the kinetic terms in the actions can be
diagonalized by letting f = f f  in d = 6, 10 and f = f i f in d = 4, 8.

3.3 massive type 0 gravity

there is still one rr form eld that can be added to the actions (19) and (20).
in a d-dimensional space-time it is possible to introduce a rank d  1 gauge
potential coupling to a corresponding extended object. it carries no physical
degrees of freedom and therefore it is not visible in the on-shell analysis of
the previous subsection. its rank d eld strength, however, carries an energy
density and it does aect the physics. this form will be used in section
5 when constructing various eld theory duals. this case will provide the
simplest example which displays most of the interesting physics, and it allows
one to avoid the complications of disentangling the kaluza-klein modes.

in type iia supergravity (and thus in d = 10 type 0a for each rr sec-
tor) it is well known how to introduce such a eld [40, 41]. the required
modications in the bosonic sector are the addition of the terms

z mf10 +

1
2

m 2  1

(21)

to the action, and a further shift of the 2- and the 4-form eld strengths
by mb and mb2/2, respectively. the gauge transformations are changed
accordingly in order to re-ensure gauge invariance. integrating over the gauge
potential of f10 imposes the constraint that m be constant. solving the
equation of motion for m establishes a connection between m and f10. in
the case b = 0  relevant to our analysis  they are simply hodge duals of
each other as is readily seen from (21).

from the string theory point of view [36], the natural generalization of
the rr -function equations implies dfd = 0 and dfd = 0, as the top-form,
too, appears in the reduction of an even dimensional type 0a bispinor into
antisymmetric tensor representations. in our case, we must also include the
coupling with the tachyon. the relevant addition is

2 z f (t )fd  fd

that we assume be present in any dimension.

(22)

4 classical solutions

in what follows we shall show that the above described low energy theories
allow freundrubin type solutions [42], where the dilaton and the tachyon
are constant, the space-time factorizes into a product of an ads space and
a sphere, and the only nontrivial form-eld is a rr eld. such types of
solutions are very familiar from the supergravity literature, see e.g. [43, 44,
45, 46, 47].

it is sucient to consider the einstein frame action10

(23)

where v (t ) is the sum of the tachyon potential and the central charge decit,
and f (t ) is the coupling between the (p + 2)-dimensional rr form f and the
tachyon. the rr gauge eld is the appropriate linear combination of some
of the elds of the previous section in such a way that the kinetic terms are
diagonal. after diagonalization, f (t ) no longer has any particular symmetry
property.

the coecients a and b are

a = s 2

b =

the eld bm n that we are setting to zero here may appear linearly in the
full action only in the chernsimons term, but in that case multiplied by
f  f , which will vanish in the freundrubin ansatz.

the equations of motion can be summarized as follows:

that of most of the recent literature.

(30)

again, we have ignored potential contributions from chernsimons terms
because they vanish for the classical solution. they do contribute to the
analysis of the uctuations in the general case and also for this reason, in
the next section, when computing the critical properties of the eld theory
duals we restrict to the simple case d = p + 2 where such complications do
not arise. we hope to return to the general case in a later paper [25].

these equations of motion have a solution with constant dilaton  = 0

and tachyon t = t0 in the gravity background of a product space

adsp+2  sdp2.

(31)

the size of the two maximally symmetric spaces is determined by setting11

(32)

finally, the rr eld is set proportional to the volume-form of the anti-de
sitter space, and hence its only nontrivial components are

f1p+2 = f0 qg(adsp+2) 1p+2,

where the constant f0 is related to the conserved charge k by

11the greek indices refer to the ads space and the latin indices to the sphere.

k = f (t0) eb0 f0 .

(33)

(34)

17

given the two functions v (t ) and f (t ), the tachyon and the dilaton
vacuum expectation values are determined from eqs. (26), (27) and (34).
the tachyon t0 can be expressed implicitly, as the solution of an algebraic
equation, namely

f (t0)
f (t0)

=

1
2

(d  2p  4)

v (t0)
v (t0)

.

(35)

the dilaton 0 can then be readily obtained from

e(a+b)0 =

(d  2p  4)

k2

f (t0) v (t0)

.

(36)

the radii of the anti-de sitter space r0 and that of the sphere l0 can be
solved from the einstein equations (28)

ea0
v (t0)

l2
0 = (d  p  3)(d  2p  4)

ea0
v (t0)

.

(37)

(38)

in the derivation we assumed k 6= 0. also three special dimensionalities

were excluded for compactness:

a) the case d = p + 3 leads to an innite radius in the ads space-time,
i.e. the at minkowski space times a circle, and is not considered in
what follows.

b) for d = 2p + 2 the dilaton becomes a free parameter. rather than
its vacuum expectation value 0, the charge k is determined from the
equation of motion (26)

k2 = 2v (t0) f (t0) .

(39)

the rest of the formulae (35), (37) and (38) are still valid.

c) we assumed that v (t0) 6= 0. in addition to some completely ricci at
solutions this condition also excludes the middle dimensional branes,
for which we have d = 2p + 4. in these dimensions the radii are

r2

0 = l2

0 = 4 (p + 1)

f (t0)

(40)

18

now t0 is determined from v (t0) = 0 (not v (t0) = 0) and 0 from

v (t0)ea0

f (t0)
f (t0)2 = 0 .

(41)

the solutions discussed above are physically acceptable only for f (t0) > 0.

5 dual eld theory interpretation

in this section we nally make contact with the conjectured gravity/eld
theory duality by studying the eld theory duals of the type 0 theories for
the simple case of d = p + 2. this case already contains all the relevant
qualitative features of the most general one, without the complication of the
kaluzaklein analysis.

let us state the logic of the approach. the classical solutions on the
gravity side correspond to xed points on the eld theory side. there is
a geodesic ow that relates these classical solutions, which is interpreted as
the renormalization group ow connecting dierent xed points. fluctuation
modes with positive, vanishing, and negative mass square correspond to ir-
relevant, marginal, and relevant deformations. the critical exponents can be
obtained from these masses and they depend on a nite set of undetermined
parameters due to the arbitrariness of the tachyon couplings. these parame-
ters should be xed by comparing some universal quantities with experiment
which leads to a prediction for the remaining quantities.

5.1 stability of the adsd solutions

classical solutions can serve as sound vacua for a quantum theory only if
small uctuations around the solutions are stable. in minkowski space this
implies that tachyonic uctuation modes are forbidden.
in an ads back-
ground this requirement can be relaxed, and one nds the bound [48, 49, 50,
51]

m2  

(d  1)2

4

1
r2
0

.

(42)

for the masses of the scalar uctuation modes.

19

the rst source of these instabilities near the solutions found in the pre-
vious section are obviously uctuations in the tachyon eld t . tachyonic
instabilities may enter also through the various scalar elds that appear on
the ads space, as the elds are compactied on the sphere sdp2. in order
to show that the theory is stable against these perturbations, one has to lin-
earize the full set of equations of motion around the classical solution, and
check that no mode violates the bound (42).

this can be done, but the physically relevant features already appear in
the case where the transverse sphere is absent. we shall discuss this example
below in detail.

as d = p+2, the nontrivial rr eld is the top-form, dual to a cosmological

constant

f1p+2 = f g 1p+2 .

(43)

note, that this is no longer the freundrubin ansatz, but the rr eld is
a priori entirely general and unconstrained. this is the eld discussed in
section 3.3. the equation of motion (29) becomes in this case a constraint,
and it turns out that the conserved charge is

k = f (t ) eb f .

(44)

with the help of (44), the equations of motion for the other elds reduce to
a hamiltonian form

 = 
t =

r =

v(, t )

where the eective potential is

let us linearize the equations of motion near a classical solution

t = t0 + t

g = g + h .

20

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)
(50)
(51)

in order to do this, we need some knowledge of the functions v (t ) and
f (t ). the only characteristics of these functions that will enter the stability
analysis are the coecients

x =

v (t0)
v (t0)

,

y =

v (t0)
v (t0)

,

and

z =

f (t0)
f (t0)

.

perturbative string theory analysis around t = 0 yields [5]

d  2
v (t ) = d  10 
8
1
t 2 + o(t 3).
f (t ) = 1 + t +
2

t 2 + o(t 4)

(52)

(53)

(54)

this is not enough to determine the coecients (52), and they should in-
deed be treated as free parameters of the theory. including other unknown
functions (see discussion in section 3.1) would give rise to more than three
such parameters, but the analysis performed here would still have the same
qualitative features.

the fact that the graviton uctuations actually decouple completely from
those of the scalars simplies the calculations: the graviton equations of
motion can, in fact, be derived to rst order from the eective action

sh = z ddx q(g + h) (r(g + h) + v(0, t0)) .

the scalar uctuations obey

(59)

if we assume, following [6], that f (t ) = exp(t ), the system simplies
considerably, and we can easily extract some interesting qualitative features
because the only undetermined parameter is y. the remaining two param-
eters can be determined by the equations of motion to be x = 2/d and
z = 1.
there turns out to be three dierent, continuously connected phases:
first, there can be two particles, both with positive mass squared. second,
there can be a particle and a tachyon that obeys the bound (42). third,
there can be a tachyon that makes the vacuum unstable. in ads/cft cor-
respondence this translates into the statement that there can be at most one
relevant operator in the infrared near the xed point described by this theory.

5.2 solutions connecting conformal xed points

the stability analysis as applied to the critical points of the potential yields
local information about the behavior of the dual eld theory near its xed
points. depending on the form of the potential, there may exist gravity
solutions that interpolate between dierent critical points. these solutions
should be interpreted on the eld theory side as rg trajectories between
conformal points.

in order to study these interpolating solutions we consider the ansatz

ds2 = dy2 + a2(y) dx2
k

(60)

and allow the two scalars to depend on the liouville coordinate y. we already
know from the previous sections that there are exact solutions of the form

a(y) = ey/r ,

(61)

where r is the radius of the pertinent ads space.

the einstein equation gives rise to two independent equations. dening

the following auxiliary function

(y) = (d  1)

d
dy

log(a) ,

(62)

22

the full set of equations takes the form

(65)

(

~)2  0 .

here we denote derivatives with respect to y with a dot, and we have intro-
duced the compact notation ~ = (, t ) for the two scalars.

provided   0, equation (64) has the physical interpretation of a particle
moving on a plane in the potential v, subject to a friction force. let us
assume that the potential has two critical points ~1 and ~2 that satisfy
v(~1) > v(~2), and that there is at least one unstable direction at ~1 for
increasing y and, similarly, a stable direction for ~2. this can always be
arranged by choosing the o(t 4) part in v (t ) suitably. due to the friction
coecient we expect our particle to roll down starting from the ir xed
point, and to converge in an innite amount of time towards the lower uv
xed point. this happens, since  is strictly positive: indeed, at the critical
points  approaches the values

 
 

d  1
r1
d  1
r2

for y  
for y  + ,

(66)

(67)

and the friction coecient decreases monotonously between them according
to (65). this is consistent with the fact that

r2

1,2 =

(d  1)(d  2)

v(~1,2)

(68)

as follows from (63).

the solution might be oscillatory near the uv critical point. whether
this happens depends on whether the friction is enough to stop the particle
as it arrives at the lower point. clearly, if one wants to interpret the result
as an rg ow, the oscillatory behavior would be dicult to accommodate in

23

the eld theory picture. the oscillatory solutions are exactly the solutions
that would violate the bound (42), which is a necessary condition for the
consistency of the system on the gravity side. hence, quite remarkably, the
stability in the gravity theory is dual to the consistency of the eld theory
interpretation.

some universal information can be read from the local behavior of these
solutions. in the spirit of the wilsonian rg treatment, let us study the crit-
ical behavior near the two xed points in the linearized approximation. we
must rst identify the appropriate coordinate which in eld theory can be
consistently interpreted as the energy scale and parameterizes the interpo-
lating solution. such a coordinate is

u =

a2
a

(69)

since at the critical points this reduces to u = r ey/r, where the metric takes
the standard form

notice rst that the stability condition (42) ensures the reality of the roots
and they only depend on the dimensionless parameters x, y, and z.

2 = 0, otherwise, the trajectory may in general start with a linear
combination of the two eigenvectors. the trajectory will then evolve to the
uv xed point as u   where there will be at least one negative mass
eigenvalue, say (muv

be non-zero and the root 1

and buv

+ will dominate.

in the ads/cft correspondence it is common to identify g2

ym = e.
this relation is plausible by considering the weak coupling expansion of the
world-volume gauge theory living on the stack of d-branes. on the other
hand, away from the gaussian xed point there is no a priori reason to make
such an identication. thus we will stay general and regard  and t as the
coupling constants.

we can now read o the leading order behavior of the -functions near

the xed points:

i(gi) = u

dgi
du

= i

+(gi  g

i ) + . . . ,

(75)

+ and the anomalous dimension is i
+.

where gi = i. in particular, the conformal dimension of an operator coupled
to the bulk eld i(u, x) (a linear combination of the original tachyon and
dilaton) is i = d  1 + i
note that, if + vanishes, then we should have a = 0 as well. this repre-
sents a marginal operator within our approximation and the computation of
the -function would pick up the sub-leading contribution which in the uv
is  = (d 1). this is what happens in [30], where the rg ow is studied
in the framework of type ii supergravity.
one could also study conning and asymptotically free solutions of these
models as well as extend to situations where kaluzaklein modes are present.
we hope to return to some of these issues in the future.
