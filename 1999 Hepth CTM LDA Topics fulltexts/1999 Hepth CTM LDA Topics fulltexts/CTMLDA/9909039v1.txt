abstract

we obtain, for a subclass of structure functions characterizing a rst

class hamiltonian system, recursive relations from which the general

form of the local symmetry transformations can be constructed in

terms of the independent gauge parameters. we apply this to a non-

trivial hamiltonian system involving two primary constraints, as well

as two secondary constraints of the nambu-goto type.

the problem of nding the most general local symmetries of a lagrangian

has been pursued by various authors, using either lagrangian [1, 2, 3, 4] or

hamiltonian techniques [5, 6, 7, 8].

in a recent paper [9] we had shown that the requirement of commutativity

of the time derivative operation with an arbitrary innitesimal gauge vari-

ation generated by the rst class constraints was the only input needed for

obtaining the restrictions on the gauge parameters entering the most general

form of the generator of lagrangian symmetries. the analysis was performed

entirely in the hamiltonian framework. on the basis of this commutativity

requirement, we subsequently derived [10] a simple dierential equation for

the generator encoding, in particular, the restrictions on the gauge parame-

ters.

in this paper we shall obtain, for a subclass of structure functions char-

acterizing a rst class hamiltonian system, the explicit solution of the above

dierential equation in the form of simple recursive relations. we then apply

this general scheme to a non-trivial model discussed in the literature [12],

whose secondary (rst class) constraints are identical with the primary con-

straints of the nambu-goto model. our result for the gauge transformation

is found to agree with that quoted in the literature.

we shall consider purely rst class systems. the extension to mixed rst

and second class systems is straightforward. to keep the algebra simple we

assume all constraints to be irreducible.

consider a hamiltonian system whose dynamics is described by the total

hamiltonian 4

ht = hc +xa1

va1a1 .

(1)

where hc is the canonical hamiltonian, {a1  0} are the (rst class) primary

constraints, and va1 are the associated lagrange multipliers. we denote the

4we follow here the notation of ref. [9].

complete set of (primary and secondary) constraints 5 by {a} = {a1, a2}.

following the conjecture of dirac [13], the generator of the gauge trans-

formations g is given by

where the gauge parameters are allowed to depend in general on time, as well

aa

(2)

g = xa

as on the phase space variables and lagrange multipliers. an innitesimal

transformation on the coordinates, generated by g, is then given by

q = a[q, a] ,

(3)

where a summation over repeated indices is always understood.

the poisson algebra of the constraints with themselves and with the

canonical hamiltonian, is of the form

[hc, a] = v b

a b

[a, b] = c c

abc

(4)

(5)

where v b

a and c c

ab may be functions of the phase-space variables.

as was shown in [6, 9, 10], g in (2) will generate a local symmetry of the

corresponding total lagrangian, provided the following relations hold:

vb1 =

0 =

db1
dt
db2
dt

 a[v b1

a + va1c b1

a1a] ,

 a[v b2

a + va1c b2

a1a] .

(6)

(7)

in the above equations, da

dt denotes the total time derivative. for obtaining

the generator of the symmetries of the original lagrangian, only eq. (7) is

relevant. eq. (6) is required for consistency on hamiltonian level.

as was shown in [10], the above equations can be compactly summarized

in a simple dierential equation for the generator g expressing its time

independence:

g
t

+ [g, ht ] = 0 .

(8)

5secondary refers to all generations of constraints beyond the primary one.

3

equations (6) and (7) describe the restrictions imposed on the lagrange mul-

tipliers and gauge parameters for the most general case where the structure

functions depend on coordinates and momenta. we now seek a solution of

(7) under two assumptions:

i) the poisson bracket of any constraint with the primary constraints is

a linear combination of only the primary constraints. this implies c b2

a1a = 0,

and hence the absence of the last term in (7).

ii) the structure functions v b2

a are constants.

these conditions appear at rst sight to be very restrictive. however,

many of the physically interesting theories, fall into this class.

the problem of nding the generator of gauge transformations subject to

the above assumptions was considered in [14]. starting from the general set

of equations (7), we present here a more compact and transparent approach

to the solution, which in fact will include the case of eld dependent structure

functions v b2

a , if there are no terciary constraints.

in order to solve the equations (7) it is convenient to organize the con-

straints into families, where the parent of each family a is given by a

primary constraint (a)

0 , and the remaining members are recursively derived

from [14]

[hc, (a)

i1] = (a)

i

,

i = 1, ..., na .

(9)

with an obvious change in notation, this implies that the corresponding

structure functions satisfy

v ab
ij = abi,j1 ,

i = 0,   , na  1 .

(10)

in order to ensure that the constraints thus obtained are irreducible, we must

adopt some systematic procedure. a possibility is to perform this iteration

level by level, for all primary constraints, simultaneously. we terminate a

family a, if at a given level na, the poisson bracket of the constraint (a)

na

with hc can be written as a linear combination of the members of all the

4

families up to this level. however, independent of the specic procedure

chosen, the poisson bracket of the nal member of each family with hc is

given by

[hc, (a)

na] =

m

xb=1

nb

xj=0

naj(b)
v ab

j

,

(11)

where m is the number of (independent) primary constraints.

in the new notation, equation (7) reads

0 =

d(a)
i
dt



m

xb=1

nb

xj=0

(b)
j v ba

ji

,

i = 1,   , na .

(12)

choosing as our independent parameters the ones associated with the last

member in each family,

a := (a)

na(t) ,

(13)

the equations (12) take the form

d(a)
i
dt

 (a)

i1 

m

xb=1

bv ba

nbi = 0 ,

i = 1,   , na .

(14)

the solution to this set of equations can be constructed iteratively, by start-

ing with the last member of a family:

(a)
na1 =

da
dt



m

xb=1

bv ba

nbna .

(15)

continuing in the same fashion, one easily sees that the general solution can

be written in the form

with the normalization

(a)
i =

nai

m

xn=0

xb=1

dnb
dtn

aba

i(n) .

aab

na(0) = ab ,

(16)

(17)

following from our choice of parametrization (13). substituting the above

ansatz into (14) and comparing powers in the time derivatives, we obtain the

recursion relations

aab

i(n1) = aab

i1(n) ,

i = 1,   , na,

(18)

5

with the initial conditions

aab

i1(0) = v ab

nai ,

i = 1,   , na.

(19)

it is easy to see, that these recursion relations determine the complete solu-

tion, from which the generator of the lagrangian gauge symmetries can be

obtained. using (16) in the generator (2), the innitesimal gauge transfor-

mation (3) takes the form

where

q =

m

xb=1xn0

(n)b(q, q) =

(20)

(21)

with (0) = 1, and where it is understood that the canonical momenta are to

be replaced by the respective expressions in terms of the lagrangian variables.

expression (21) is in the form obtained by purely lagrangian methods [2, 4,

11].

in the case where all the families contain at most two members, the

primary constraints will have vanishing poisson brackets with all of the con-

straints 6, amounting to a vanishing of the last term in (7).

in that case

we can also relax the above assumption concerning the constancy of the

structure functions v ab

ij , since our iterative scheme already terminates with

equation (15) with na = nb = 1, and we have for the generator

g =

m

xa=1"  da

(22)

the following modied version of the nambu-goto model has these features.

consider the lagrangian [12]

(23)

6this can be easily veried by noticing that in this case the canonical hamiltonian

can always be written in the form hc(q, p, ) = h0(q, p) + t [12], where the lagrange

multipliers  are the variables conjugate to the primary constraints, and implement the

secondary constraints t  0.

6

where the 4-vector x(, ) labels the coordinates of a string parametrized

by  and , with the dot and prime denoting the derivative with respect

to  and , respectively. there are two primary constraints, 1  0 and

2  0, where 1 and 2 are the momenta conjugate to the elds (, ) and

(, ), respectively. hence in our notation

(1)
0 = 1 , (2)

0 = 2 .

the canonical hamiltonian reads,

hc = z d{


2

(p2 + x2) + p  x} ,

(24)

(25)

where p is the four-momentum conjugate to the coordinate x. the con-

servation in time of the primary constraints leads respectively to secondary

constraints, which in our notation read

(1)
1 =

1
2

(p2 + x2)  0 , (2)

1 = p  x  0 .

(26)

one readily checks that there are no further constraints.

we see that the secondary constraints are just the primary constraints of

the nambu-goto string model. they satisfy the familiar poisson brackets 7

[(1)

1 (), (1)

1 ()] = (2)

1 ()(  )  (2)

1 () (  )

[(1)

1 (), (2)

1 ()(  )  (1)

[(2)

1 (), (2)

1 ()] = (2)

1 ()(  )  (2)

1 ()(  ) .

(27)

(28)

(29)

all other poisson brackets vanish. the constraints are seen to be rst class.

in our terminology, we thus have two families, each with two members.

the canonical hamiltonian is of the form

hc = z d((1)

1 () + (2)

1 ()) .

(30)

11 (, ) = v 21

11 (, ) =  (() + 2()) (  ) .

(33)

since for the example in question n1 = n2 = 1, it follows from (15), that our

iterative scheme for nding the solution already ends at the rst step, with

(a)

from (2) and (3) we now compute the corresponding transformation laws for

the elds to be

x = 1p + 2x ,

.

(37)

making use of the expressions for (a)

0 derived above, we verify that our results

(37) agree with that quoted in the literature [12].

to summarize, we have shown that the equations dening the restrictions

to be imposed on the gauge parameters in (2) could be solved following a

simple iterative scheme, in the case where the structure functions c c2

a1b in eq.

(7) vanish and v b2

a are constants. we have then applied the general ideas to

the case of a non-trivial model with a two-family constraint structure, sharing

8

some properties with the familiar nambu-goto model of string theory. since

each family of constraints consisted only of two members, our general solution

was applicable, although the structure functions v b2
a

are functions of the

elds. we thereby recovered the local symmetry transformations quoted in

the literature.
