abstract

we present an investigation of the boundary breather states of the sinh-gordon
model restricted to a half-line. the classical boundary breathers are presented for
a two parameter family of integrable boundary conditions. restricting to the case
of boundary conditions which preserve the    symmetry of the bulk theory,
the energy spectrum of the boundary states is computed in two ways: rstly, by
using the bootstrap technique and subsequently, by using a wkb approximation.
requiring that the two descriptions of the spectrum agree with each other allows a
determination of the relationship between the boundary parameter, the bulk coupling
constant, and the parameter appearing in the reection factor derived by ghoshal
to describe the scattering of the sinh-gordon particle from the boundary.

introduction

in recent years, there has been renewed interest in eld theories dened on restricted domains.
in particular, integrable two-dimensional models, for example ane toda eld theories, may
be conned to a half-line or an interval by boundary conditions which maintain integrability
[3, 25, 16, 5] (for a partial review, see [7]). the variety of possibilities is intriguing although in
most toda theories the freedom to choose boundary conditions is severely limited to a nite,
discrete set of possibilities. in fact, within the models based on the a(1)
n data, only
the model based on a(1)
1 , the sinh-gordon model, allows parameters to be introduced as part of
the boundary conditions [1].

n or e(1)

n , d(1)

an outstanding question concerns the quantum integrability of models with boundaries
and although there has been some progress towards understanding particular examples, mostly
within the class of models based on the an series, there remains much to be done to discover the
systematics underpinning the apparently bewildering variety of cases.

even within the sinh/sine-gordon model, about which so much is now known, there remain
some open questions. up to the present there appears to be a gap in the understanding of
how the boundary data, which is prescribed in order to formulate the boundary conditions of
the model, is related to the parameters appearing in the family of reection factors describing
particle-boundary scattering. finding this relationship needs the answers to dynamical questions
which cannot be resolved by general requirements such as the reection yang-baxter equation,
or crossing-unitarity.
in this article we shall examine the sinh-gordon model restricted to
a half-line by boundary conditions preserving its bulk symmetry and for which one expects
boundary bound states, and we shall approach the boundary bound states from two points of
view. on the one hand, we will calculate their spectrum using a semi-classical approach rooted
in the classic work of dashen, hasslacher and neveu [12] while, on the other, we will compute
the same data using bootstrap techniques. the marriage of the two approaches will yield strong
evidence for a conjectured relationship between the reection factors and the boundary data.

2 the sinh-gordon model on the half line

the sinh-gordon model describes a single real scalar eld  in 1+1 dimension with exponential
self-interaction. the eld equation is

x +

8m2



sinh(2) = 0,

(2.1)

where m and  are parameters and we have used normalisations customary in ane toda eld
theories of which the sinh-gordon model is the simplest example [2]. the dimensional mass
parameter m will be set to unity.

in contrast to the sine-gordon model with its soliton and breather solutions the sinh-gordon
model has only one real non-singular classical solution, namely the constant vacuum solution

sinh-gordon particle.

in the quantum theory the small oscillations around this vacuum correspond to the

the sinh-gordon model is integrable which implies in particular that there are innitely many
independent conserved charges qs, where s is any odd integer, and the s-matrix describing
the scattering of n sinh-gordon particles factorises into a product of n(n  1)/2 two-particle
scattering amplitudes. the scattering between two particles of relative rapidity  is conjectured
to be given by the s-matrix factor [14, 28]

where we have used the convenient block notation [2]

s() =

(x) =

and the coupling constant b is related to the bare coupling constant  by b = 22/(4 + 2).
traditionally, scattering and other properties of the sinh-gordon model have been obtained
from knowledge of the lowest breather in the sine-gordon model by analytic continuation in the
coupling constant (but, see also [26]).

the sinh-gordon model can be restricted to the left half-line   x  0 without losing

integrability by imposing the boundary condition

x|0 =

(0,t)  1e

(0,t)(cid:17) ,

(2.4)

where 0 and 1 are two additional parameters [16, 21]. this set of boundary conditions generally
breaks the reection symmetry    of the sinh-gordon model. however, the symmetry is
preserved when 0 = 1   and much of this article will be devoted to this special case.
to describe the sinh-gordon particles on the half line one needs in addition to the two-
particle scattering amplitude (2.2) also the amplitude for the reection of a single particle from
the boundary. this reection amplitude can be deduced from the lowest breather reection
amplitude in the sine-gordon model by analytic continuation in the coupling constant (i.e.,
the continuation   2/b in the notation of [16]). using the breather reection amplitudes
calculated by ghoshal [17] givesc

k(, 0, 1, ) =

(1  e(0, 1, ))(1 + e(0, 1, ))(1  f (0, 1, ))(1 + f (0, 1, ))

(1)(2  b/2)(1 + b/2)

,

(2.5)

where we are again using the block notation from (2.3) but in (2.5)  represents the rapidity of
a single particle. when the bulk reection symmetry is preserved one of the two parameters e
or f vanishes. we shall choose f = 0, and consequently one obtains

k0(, )  k(, , ) =

(2.6)

cin ghoshals notation e = b/, f = ib/.

2

actually, the rst factor, kd is the reection factor corresponding to the dirichlet boundary
condition (0, t) = 0, as noted in [16, 17]. all reection factors satisfy the crossing-unitarity
relation which, in the case of scalar reection factors, reads,

k (cid:18) +

i

2 (cid:19) k (cid:18) 

i

2 (cid:19) s(2) = 1.

(2.7)

the dirichlet reection factor kd satises (2.7) by itself.

in this paper we note that contrary to the situation on the whole line, the sinh-gordon
equation restricted to a half-line by integrable boundary conditions has non-singular, nite
energy, breather solutions. after quantising, these will lead to a spectrum of boundary bound
states which ought to match not only the physical strip poles of the expression (2.6) but also
the poles appearing in similar expressions derived from (2.6) using the boundary bootstrap.
these derived reection factors will be determined below and represent the sinh-gordon particle
reecting from the excited boundary states. matching the two ways of looking at the energies
of the excited states will determine a relation between ,  and e, see eq.(5.29). in fact the
relationship between the two parameters coincides with a tentative suggestion made in [8].

a similar analysis is feasible in the general case (0 6= 1) but it will not be carried out here.
however, the associated boundary breathers and a few of their properties will be described as
an essential preliminary to a fuller investigation.

3 boundary breathers

the sinh-gordon model on the whole line has no non-singular real solutions other than  = 0.
however, there are singular real breather solutions satisfying the boundary condition (2.4) whose
singularities can be designed to lie for all time on the right half line (x > 0). thus, they are
well-dened periodic solutions of the sinh-gordon model on the left half-line and we shall call
them boundary breathers. following hirota, with suitable choices of j, the solutions can be
written conveniently in the form [18]

2

.

 =

for the symmetrical boundary conditions with 0 = 1 = , appropriate choices are:

j = 1 + (1)j2 cos(2t sin )e2x cos  1

tan r  + cos 

  cos (cid:19) ,
  cos   e4x cos (cid:18)  + cos 

(3.1)

(3.2)

where the parameter  determines the frequency of the breather.

in order for the  functions to be real, the square root appearing in (3.2) must be, which in
turn requires that ||  cos . also, the solution will be singular whenever one of the  functions
is zero. while singularities cannot be avoided entirely it is possible to ensure that there are none

3

in the region x  0, and that is sucient for the present purpose. noting that for a particular
x singularities cannot occur at any time provided

1 < (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

tan (cid:16)1  e4 cos x(cid:16) +cos

2e2 cos xq +cos 

cos 

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

(3.3)

we deduce that requiring there are no singularities on the left half-line is equivalent to the
restrictions

1 <  < 0

and

cos  < .

(3.4)

note, at cos  =  the solution collapses to the vacuum solution  = 0 indicating that there
is a minimum allowed frequency for a breather which is strictly greater than zero. this is a
distinctive feature not shared by the usual breathers of the sine-gordon model on the full line
whose frequencies may approach zero.

the energy functional of the sinh-gordon model with boundary condition (2.4) is

but it is most easily calculated in terms of the  functions as a boundary term [10],

the energy of the real boundary breather turns out to be given by

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

and the condition (3.4) ensures ebreather is always positive, or zero if cos  = .
in the quantum theory, the continuum of boundary breather solutions is expected to lead to
a discrete spectrum of boundary states. to obtain an estimate for the energies of these boundary
states one might in the rst instance use the bohr-sommerfeld quantisation condition (see for
example [4]). one proceeds directly by calculating the left hand side of

z t

dtz 0



dx (x, t) (x, t) = (2n + 1),

(3.8)

where (x, t) =  is the momentum conjugate to , t = / sin  is the period of the breather,
and n is an integer. (as usual, we have put h = 1).

4

it is convenient to set  = cos a, 1 > a > 1/2, implying that cos1() = (1  a), then

integrating gives

z t

0

dtz 0



dx 2 =

the energy levels follow from (3.8) yielding

en =

2 (cid:18) cos a + cos (cid:18)(n + 1/2)

2

4  a(cid:19)(cid:19) .

(3.9)

(3.10)

since the breathers approach the vacuum solution as   (1  a) by reducing their ampli-
tudes to zero rather than their frequencies, it is natural that the boundary breather spectrum
should have a zero point energy. this is the reason for the postulated form of the right hand
side of (3.8).

the dierence between two consecutive bound state energies is readily deduced from (3.10)

and conveniently written,

en+1  en =

8 (cid:19) cos



2 (cid:18)(n + 1)(cid:18) 2

2(cid:19)  2a + 1(cid:19) .

(3.11)

it will be seen below that this has the form we would have anticipated from the boundary
bootstrap. however, given that we know the coupling constant renormalises, and we expect
the boundary coupling to renormalise too [22], the outcome of this calculation can be at best
an indication. a more reliable method for quantising the boundary breathers is likely to be an
adaptation of the techniques developed by dashen, hasslacher and neveu [12] and this will be
pursued in section 5.

finally, we shall end this section with a brief description of the boundary breathers in those
cases where the boundary conditions break the bulk symmetry. as before, the solutions have
the general form indicated by (3.1) but this time the two tau functions are more elaborate and
given by

where,

(3.12)

(3.13)

and a0 and a1 are related to the boundary parameters by,

0 = cos a0,

1 = cos a1.

numerical investigation of these boundary breathers indicates that they are non-singular in the
region x < 0 provided

0 < cos  <  cos
their energies are given by

(a0 + a1)

(a0 + a1)

e =

+ sin

2 (cid:17)2(cid:19) .

(3.14)

again, the breathers have frequencies bounded below because the (a0, a1) parameters are re-
stricted. for example, they could lie within the ranges 1 < a0  a1 < 1, 1 < a0 + a1 < 2 in the
positive quadrant. the boundary breathers for boundary conditions preserving the symmetry
of the sinh-gordon equation are included as the special case a0 = a1. the possibility a0 = a1
is outside the range.
these solutions may be considered as a superposition of a static soliton and a boundary
breather, carefully designed to be real and non-singular, and to satisfy the general boundary
condition (2.4). they are sinh-gordon counterparts of the sine-gordon solutions considered by
saleur, skorik and warner [24].

4 the boundary bootstrap

for certain ranges of values of the parameters e and f the particle reection amplitude (2.5)
has simple poles at particular values of  on the physical strip, 0 < im() < /2. for the case
f = 0 these mustd be due to the propagation of virtual excited boundary states. the amplitudes
for the reection of the sinh-gordon particle from these excited boundary states is obtained by
the boundary bootstrap [5, 16, 15]. when the reection factor (2.5) has a pole at  = i with
0 <  < /2 then the reection factor corresponding to the associated excited boundary state
is calculated via the relation

k1() = k0()s(  i)s( + i),

(4.1)

where s() is the two-particle s-matrix (2.2). also, since energy is conserved, the energy of the
excited boundary state is given by

d because there is no three-point coupling in the sinh-gordon model with symmetrical boundary condition,

simple poles on the physical strip can never be due to a generalised coleman-thun mechanism [13].

e1 = e0 + m() cos ,

(4.2)

6

where m() is the mass of the sinh-gordon particle.

considering the case f = 0, the regions in e where the amplitude (2.6) has poles on the

physical strip are

(4.3)
since 0  b  2, the other factors (in kd) never have poles in the physical strip. in region i,
 = (e  1)/2 and, using (4.1), we derive the reection factor for the rst excited state,

i : 2 > e > 1 and ii : 2 < e < 1;

k1 = kd

1

(1  e)(1 + e)

(1 + e + b)(1  e  b)
(1  e + b)(1 + e  b)

.

(4.4)

this in turn has a new pole at  = (e  1  b)/2 provided b < e  1 indicating another
excited state whose reection factor is
1

k2 = kd

(1  e + b)(1 + e  b)

(1 + e + b)(1  e  b)
(1  e + 2b)(1 + e  2b)

.

continuing in this vein leads to a set of excited states with associated reection factors given
by,

(4.5)

kn = kd

1

(1  e + (n  1)b)(1 + e  (n  1)b)

(1 + e + b)(1  e  b)
(1  e + nb)(1 + e  nb)

.

(4.6)

note that the pole corresponding to the (n + 1)st state will be within the correct range provided
e satises 2 > e > 1 + nb. thus, for a given e and b there can be at most a nite number
of bound states, and possibly none. note too that the reection factor for scattering from the
nth bound state also contains a pole corresponding to the (n  1)st bound state. we shall see
that there is a subtlety concerning the coecient of this pole because it develops a zero at an
n-dependent critical value of .

the energies of the boundary states are given by repeatedly applying (4.2) and satisfy,

en+1 = en + m() cos


2

(nb  e + 1).

(4.7)

this is the result that we wish to compare with the quantisation of the classical breather
spectrum in order to determine e(, ) and m(). however, we shall defer the comparison until
after we have developed the dashen, hasslacher, neveu argument in the present context.

5 semi-classical quantisation

to carry out the semi-classical calculation it is rst necessary to solve the sinh-gordon equation
linearised in the presence of the boundary breathers. setting  = 0 + , the linear wave
equations for the uctuations are:

2
t2 

2

x2 + 4 cosh20 = 0,

(cid:18) 

x

+ 2 cosh

02(cid:19)x=0

= 0.

(5.1)

7

it is convenient to solve (5.1) by perturbing (3.1); in other words, we take

 =

10  01

,

with j chosen as follows:

j + j = 1 + ()j ((e1 + e2 + e1 + e2) + a12e1e2 + e1(11e1 + 12e2)

(5.2)

(5.3)

+e2(21e1 + 22e2) + ()ja12e12(1112e1 + 2122e2).

in (5.3) we have made use of the hirota expression for the general multi-soliton solution to
the sine-gordon equation [18, 19], suitably adapted to solve the sinh-gordon equation, keeping
terms up to rst order in e1 and e2. the various quantities are given by:

e1 = 1 eit+ikx, e2 = 2 eitikx,

2  k2 = 4

e1 = exp(2x cos  + 2it sin  + x0), e2 = exp(2x cos   2it sin  + x0)

ik + 2

1

k0 =

ik  2  

(1  2a)(1 + 2a)

the ground state reection factor is easily checked directly and it is the   0 limit of the
reection factor given in (2.6). hence, we may deduce that e(0) = 2a.

the classical action of the boundary breather is calculated to be

scl = z t

and vanishes as it should when cos  = , i.e.  = (1  a).

the period t = / sin  of the boundary breather denes the stability angles via

(t + t, x) = ei(t, x)  eit (t, x)

(5.9)

and the eld theoretical version of the wkb approximation makes use of the stability angles
together with a regulator to calculate a quantum action. the standard procedure would be to
place the eld theory in an interval [l, l] with periodic boundary conditions and to manipulate
the sum over the discrete stability angles so obtained. however, that option is not available in
this case. instead, it is convenient to treat the sinh-gordon model in the interval [l, 0] and to
impose the dirichlet condition (t,l) = 0. since the limit l   will be taken eventually,
the stability angles for the boundary breather (b), or the vacuum solution (0) are eectively
determined by the reection factors given in (5.6) or (5.7), respectively.

following [12, 23] we need to calculate a sum over the stability angles and use it to correct

the classical action. thus,

where kb and k0 are the sets of (discrete) solutions to

.

once  is known the quantum action is dened by

squ = scl  .

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

one way to proceed is to note that for large k the solutions to either of (5.11) are close to

kn = (cid:18)n +

1

2(cid:19) 

l

,

and so it is reasonable to set (kb)n = (k0)n + ((k0)n)/l where, for l large, the function  is
given approximately by

e2i(k) =

(ik + 2 cos )2
(ik  2 cos )2

from (5.17) and recalling that cos  < , we deduce that  approaches zero from above as
k  . also, from (5.16) it is clear that the derivative of  is positive near k = 0 but negative
as k  . hence, the rst term in (5.15) is well-dened and the appropriate branch of  has
(0) = 0. on the other hand, the derivative of  is not decaying suciently rapidly to ensure the
second term in (5.15) is nite. however, this was to be expected since a perturbative analysis
of the sinh-gordon model conned to a half-line needs mass and boundary counter terms to
remove logarithmic divergences (which would be removed automatically by normal-ordering the
products of elds in the bulk theory). with this in mind, the integral remaining in (5.15) should
be replaced by

the rst counter-term removing the bulk divergence and the second being there to remove a
similar divergence associated with the boundary. in eect, we are regarding the parameter a
as describing the bare coupling which appears in the boundary part of the lagrangian once it
is written in terms of normal-ordered products of elds. the counter-terms clearly respect the
symmetry and the whole expression vanishes when  = (1  a). the integrals in (5.18) need
to be treated carefully with an eye to the facts that cos  > 0 but cos a < 0.

assembling the various components leads to

here, n = n + n0 with n a positive integer or zero, and we expect n0 should be 1/2. hence,
the energies of the quantised boundary breather states are determined by a set of special angles

notice that as   0, n  (1  a) independently of n. thus, the frequencies collapse to
the lowest allowed frequency, namely 0 = 2 sin a. on the other hand, in the same limit the
energies are independent of  and non-zero,

en  n0.

(5.26)

this is precisely the spectrum of a harmonic oscillator vibrating at the fundamental frequency
0 provided we set n = n + 1/2. with this interpretation, the vacuum has a non-zero zero-point
energy due to the presence of the boundary.

using (5.25) the corresponding dierences in the energy levels are given by

(5.27)

comparing (5.27) with the outcome of the bootstrap calculation (4.7) ought to assist us in
identifying the unknown parameter e which appeared in the expression for the reection factor
(2.6). thus, from the rst excited level we deduce,

e  1 =

2b

2 (2a  1)  n0b  (2a  1)(cid:18)1 

b

2 (cid:19)  n0b.

rearranging, we have

(5.28)

(5.29)

taking the limit as a  1/2 from above, (5.29) is in agreement with the expression given
by ghoshal and zamolodchikov for the neumann condition provided n0 = 1/2 [16]. with a
arbitrary, (5.29) agrees both with perturbative calculations to order 2 given in [8, 27], and with
a conjectured all-orders guess reported in [8]. once n0 is chosen, the other excited states match
up in the two calculations without any further adjustments.

in the bulk sine-gordon theory the analogous quantity to n0 vanishes in the dashen, hass-
lacher, neveu calculation of the breather spectrum. in the half-line theory, we have found that
the two ways of regarding the spectrum of boundary bound states match provided n0 = 1/2.
although we do not yet have an independent reason for expecting this value of n0 on the basis
of wkb theory, its appearance in (5.23) is reminiscent of the extra 1/2 correction to the bohr-
sommerfeld quantization condition and it also provides a natural interpretation of the limiting
spectrum (5.26)

the comparison with (4.7) also permits us to deduce an expression for m(), the mass of

the sinh-gordon particle:

m() =

8
b

sin

b
4

.

(5.30)

this is independently interesting. previously, the same expression for the mass has been de-
duced via analytic continuation using a knowledge of the sine-gordon breather spectrum on
the whole-line. however, here it arrives naturally within the context of the sinh-gordon model
itself. it appears that once the model is dened in a restricted region by boundary conditions
which permit the existence of boundary states, boundary eects allow bulk parameters to be
determined. notice that periodic boundary conditions, which are in some respects the most
natural to impose, and are certainly the traditional choice, do not share this property.

6 discussion

in this section we need to take another look at the two descriptions of the boundary bound state
spectrum. using what we have learned, the boundary states are described by two dierent sets
of angles which are linear functions of b. from the wkb calculation we have the set n given
by

n = (1  a) +



2 (cid:18)n + a 

1

2(cid:19) b,

n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . .

(6.1)

the ground state corresponds to 0 and lies in the spectrum for all values of b. this is clear
because as b traverses its range from 0 to 2, 0 increases from (1  a) to /2. on the other
hand, n, n  1 corresponds to an excited state which will leave the spectrum at some critical
value of b when n attains /2. specically, the critical couplings are given by,

bc

n =

2(2a  1)
2n + 2a  1

,

or

c 2
n
4

=

2a  1
2n

.

12

(6.2)

the other description is derived from the bootstrap. taking the conjectured form of e,

(5.29) with n0 = 1/2, leads to another set of angles n dened by

n =


2

(2a  1  (a + n  1)b) , n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .

(6.3)

although these describe the same set of states via the bootstrap, the angles are clearly very
dierent. one striking dierence concerns the critical value of the coupling bc
n at which the
state exits the spectrum. the angles (6.3) clearly decrease with increasing b and the critical
point is reached when an angle vanishes. thus, we have
c 2
n
4

(6.4)

or

bc

n =

=

2a  1
a + n  1

,

2a  1
2n  1

.

the two critical points (6.2) and (6.4) are similar but not the same. curiously, in terms of the
inverse coupling the dierence is independent of n:

4
n 
c 2

c 2

n

2a  1

the fact that the two critical points are dierent needs explanation. unfortunately, we do not
have a complete dynamical explanation of this. the problem is that a bound state appears to
leave the spectrum before the pole marking it in a reection factor moves out of range.

consider the bound state with label n. at the associated rapidity in there is a pole in the
two reection factors kn1 and kn. in the rst of these, the pole indicates the possibility of
exciting the state n 1 to the state n; in the second it indicates the possibility of dropping from
state n down to state n  1. in both cases, of course, the process is virtual, but in the second
the process corresponds to a crossed diagram. of the various parts in (4.6), the one which
produces the cross-channel pole is (1 e + (n 1)b), one of the factors in the denominator. at
the critical coupling this is cancelled by the factor (1  e + nb) because, at the critical value
bc
n, 2e  (2n  1)b = 2. this is consistent with a zero in the s-matrix (2.2) at ibc
n/2 which
contributes to the cross-channel diagram. for values of the coupling between the two critical
values, the pole at in in kn1 needs explanation.

that the pole indicating a bound state can persist beyond the value of the coupling at which
the bound state ceases to exist is a phenomenon familiar in the breather spectrum of the bulk
sine-gordon model. in the notation we have been using, we simply make the change   i and
redene b(i) = b. then, the nth breather leaves the spectrum at b = 2/n. this is typically
signalled by the appearance of double poles in s-matrices, rather than the pole position moving
across the boundary of the physical strip. however, in this case, the explanation for the pole
beyond the critical coupling lies in a coleman-thun mechanism using solitons.e

a second point we wish to discuss is the following. given the expression for e, (5.29) with
n0 = 1/2, we see immediately that if the paramter a is held xed as b  2, then e  0, and
every reection factor (4.6) has the same limit

kn  

1
(1)2 .

(6.5)

ewe thank patrick dorey for pointing this out to us.

the latter is the classical reection factor corresponding to the boundary condition (2.4) with
0 = 1 = 1 [6]. it is natural to suppose that the same expression for e(, ) will be appropriate
for  > 0 although we cannot prove it. however, if it is the case, then almost all reection
factors will have the property (6.5). the exception to this is the symmetrical dirichlet condition
whose reection factor has the property kd(4/) = kd(); that is, kd is self-dual. apart
from noting the phenomenon we can oer no explanation as to why one particular non-linear
boundary condition should be singled out to be the limit point of almost all the others.
it
will be interesting to discover if this remains so after the complete analysis of the general case
0 6= 1. it is perhaps worth remarking that this special boundary condition is one of the two
singled out in the supersymmetric version of the model [20] (for the other 0 = 1 = 1). if
the expression for e is also correct for  > 0 then e(1, )  0, indicating that this specially
symmetrical boundary condition also has a self-dual reection factor. perhaps this is also true
for the model with supersymmetry.

in this article, we have obtained the expression (5.29) for e in terms of the parameter a.
however, there is an indication from work on higher a(1)
n toda theories that the renormalised
boundary parameter is not e itself but g = e + b/2. in these theories, for n > 1, there is only
a discrete set of integrable boundary conditions and for many of these the reection factors are
known [11]. these reection factors can be specialised to the case n = 1 which corresponds to
the sinh-gordon model and one obtains the reection factor (2.6) at xed (coupling constant
independent) values of g = e + b/2 rather than xed values of e. further motivation for
regarding g = e + b/2 as the physical boundary parameter comes from the study of solitons
in the sine-gordon model on the half line [9].

finally, it must be said that the wkb method gives an all orders result in terms of  and is
exact for the bulk sine-gordon model. again, we would probably be surprised if that were not
the case in the present setting.
