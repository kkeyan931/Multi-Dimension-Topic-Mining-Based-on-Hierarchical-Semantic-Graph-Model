1 introduction and summary

compactication on an elliptic calabi-yau three-fold z with vector bundle v embedded

in e8  e8 gives a four-dimensional heterotic string model of n = 1 supersymmetry.
originally the case of v the tangent bundle was considered which lead to an unbroken

gauge group e6 times a hidden e8. the generalisation to an su(n) bundle v1 gives
unbroken gut groups like so(10) and su(5) (we will in the following focus on the

visible sector and therefore assume an e8 bundle v2 embedded in the second e8).

especially interesting is the case where z admits an elliptic bration  : z  b2 which
has a section . this makes possible an explicit description of the bundle by using the
spectral cover3 c of b2. in this description the su(n) bundle is encoded in two data: a
class4 1 = 6c1  t in h 1,1(b2) and a class  in h 1,1(c) (the latter is connected to the
possible existence of chiral matter in these models [9], [10]). in this case it is also possible
to give a dual description by f -theory on a calabi-yau four-fold x 4 which is k3 bered
over b2 and elliptically bered over b3 which in turn is a p1 bration described by the
class t over b2. having an unbroken gauge group g on the heterotic side corresponds
then to having a section of g singularities along b2 in x 4.

it was shown [7] that an anomaly mismatch in the heterotic model causes the occurence

of a number n5 of ve-branes wrapping the elliptic ber5 f

c2(z) = c2(v1) + c2(v2) + n5f

consistent f-theory compactication on x 4 requires a number of space-time lling

threebranes which are localized at points in the base b of the elliptic four-fold. the

number of such threebranes was determined in [6] for the case of a smooth weierstrass

model for the fourfold by observing that the sugra equations have a solution only

in the appendix.

5we will stick in the following to the ansatz 1 + 2 = 12c1 which leads only to ve-branes wrapping
the elliptic ber. in general other curves would be wrapped as well [12], [16]. note that in the cases of

for a precise number of such threebranes, proportional to the euler characteristic of the

four-fold.

in the case of an e8  e8 vector bundle v , leaving no unbroken gauge group and
corresponding to a smooth weierstrass model for the fourfold it was also shown that the

number of ve-branes matches the number n3 of three-branes on the f -theory side whose
number is given by

where g  h 2,2(x 4) is the four-ux [23] (cf. appendix).

for various reasons one can expect g to be associated with ; a very condensed version

of this argument can be found in the introduction to section c of the appendix. part of

this association is the following relation

g2 = 2

one would like now to see this equation directly on the f -theory side thereby proving

(1.4).

this matching was extended [11] to the general case of heterotic string compactication
on an elliptic calabi-yau threefolds together with a su(n1)  su(n2) vector bundle
leading to an unbroken heterotic gauge group which corresponds to a certain locus of

degenerated elliptic bers in the fourfold. this concerned the case of a pure gauge
group, corresponding to having singularities of only codimension 1 for x 4. for this the

euler number of the fourfold was expressed directly in their hodge numbers, which were

matched via a direct spectrum comparison with the data of the dual heterotic model;

there essential use was made of an index-formula, computing the number of even minus

odd vector bundle moduli.

3

here we will adopt a dierent approach. we will express e(x4)
24

in pour calabi-yau

fourfold data without making any use of dual heterotic data. now in general one will

have also singularities of codimension 2 and even 3. the former arise on the f -theory side
from intersection curves of the surface components of the discriminant 6 (the compact

parts of the seven-branes in the type iib interpretation of f -theory) : the i1 surface
and the g surface b2. they are interpreted as matter [27], [28]. the idea is that for
example the collision e6 + i1 leads to an e7 which by the adjoint decomposition should
correspond to a matter hypermultiplet in the 27 of e6. on the heterotic side they arise
from a similar condition on the cohomology of the bundle which should lead to matter

and is non-trivial along certain curves where the spectral cover intersects the base (for

one class of matter curves). in certain cases (given in the main part of the paper below)

of g one can tune the class t resp. the bundle so that such an intersection does not

occur, i.e. so that one has only singularities in codimension one and only the case of a

pure gauge group. in connection with the appropriate conditions one is also lead to a

certain lower bound for the instanton number of the vector bundle conjectured in [14].

this is described in section 2.

in general one will have the matter curve in b = b2 and for the a and d groups g
even two of them, called h and p below, which intersect each other in a codimension

three locus, a number of points in b. the corresponding stratication of the discriminant

will allow us to compute the euler number of the fourfold by adding up the parts with

singular bres. the corresponding computation in 6d, i.e. for calabi-yau threefolds is

1 + 27g2

1 + 27g2

described in section 3. essential is the consideration of the cusp locus c = (f1 = 0 = g1)
inside the i1 surface component d1 (of the discriminant surface d = (4f 3 + 27g2 = 0))
which is approximately given by 4f 3
1 = 0 where in f1, g1 are split o the parts of
f, g causing the g singularity. this is exact for the ek series; for the d4+n = i 
n and in
series further n powers of z, the coordinate transversal to b1 in the hirzebruch surface
b2, can be extracted out of 4f 3
1 and one has actually the equation of divisors
d1 + nr = (4f 3
1 = 0) where r is the class of b1 in b2. in those cases one nds
that the naive cusp set cold = (f1 = 0 = g1) (zero dimensional in the 6d case) contains
actually a number x of points of the b1 line (lying on one of the matter loci given by a
divisor h) which are not cusp points7 and have to be taken out of the cusp set so that
the true cusp set is8 c = cold  xhr. this x is evaluated as the intersection multiplicity
6as in the end we want to make a comparison with a dual perturbative (up to the ve-branes) heterotic

1 + 27g2

model we consider no more general discriminant congurations

7in some cases (a3, a4, a5) other singularities arise at these points (tacnodes and even higher double

points).

8note that throughout the paper cohomology classes like h  h 1,1(b2) are identied with their

4

of f1 and g1 along h and computed via their resultant. moreover not only elliptic bers
with cusp singularities y2 = x3 lie in the bers over c but c is also a locus of intrinsic

cusp singularities for the d1 locus. so in 6d one has then to apply the usual plucker
formulas to d1.

our general approach in 4d is described in section 4. here we also give the heterotic

expectation for 24n5 (in the cases of g = a1 and a2 we give the formula for c2(v )
for v = e7 or e6 bundle in the appendix).
in section 5 we develop new plucker
formulas for the now relevant case of a surface d1 having a curve of cusp (or higher)
point singularities. these formulas are not just adiabatic extensions of the usual formulas

for singular points on a curve. actually the story is somewhat more complicated as one

also has to treat the case of curves of tacnode point singularities (where a second blow

up is needed) which occur in some cases at the collision of the d1 surface with the g
surface b2 along the h curve. then we go on to the codimension three loci in section 6.
there are two types of codimension three loci: the ones related to enhancements of the

ber at the intersection of the matter (=enhancement) curves and the intersection of the

cusp curve c with b2, (because of the precise evaluation of x it turns out that these are
actually proportional as cohomology classes) and the ones related to point singularities of

d1. in the nal section 7 we use the techniques accumulated so far to actually compute
the euler number of x 4 and to show that (with suitable assumptions) it equals 24n5
from the heterotic side where  = 0 is assumed, thereby proving 1.4.

the appendix contains the explanation why one is led to expect equ. (1.4) in a general

framework and reference material pertaining to the relevant facts about heterotic and

f -theory n = 1 models.

2 the lower bound on 

this is a necessary bound on how much instanton number has to be turned on to

generate/ll out a certain su(n) bundle, or speaking in terms of the unbroken gauge

group g (the commutator of su(n) in e8) to have no greater unbroken gauge group than
a certain g. it is treated here as a warm up because it is related to the consideration

pullbacks under  so that here for example is meant c = cold  x(h  r)

5

of singularities along just b2 and so in codimension one only9 (the case that d1 and b2
are disjoint) versus singularities in even higher codimension (like the matter curves from
the intersection of d1 and b2). we will assume that g is an ade group.10

2.1 f -theory arguments

let us recall the situation in six dimensions. there the easiest duality set-up is given

by the duality of the heterotic string on k3 with instanton numbers (12  m, 12 + m)

(and no ve-branes) with f -theory on the hirzebruch surface fm [3]. the gauge group
there is described by the singularities of the bration and a perturbative heterotic gauge

group corresponds to a certain degeneration over the zero-section c0 (of self-intersection
m): for example to get an su(3) one needs a certain a2 degeneration over c0 available
rst for m = 3; in general this means that the discriminant divisor  = 12c1(fm) has a
component (g)c0 where (g) is the vanishing order of the discriminant (equivalently
the euler number of the ane resolution tree of the singularity), giving also the relation
m  24
12(g) for the realization over a fm to have no singularity worse than g. the last
relation follows (cf. [14]): from the fact that after taking the c0 component with its full
multiplicity (g) out of  the resulting  =   (g)c0 has transversal intersection
with c0 and so   c0  0, leading with c1(fm) = 2c0 + (2 + m)f to the mentioned
result.

so the instanton number 12  m to give a g gauge group has to be 12  m  12 
24
12(g) = (6  12
12(g) )c1(b1) with b1 the common p 1 base of the heterotic k3 resp. the
fm. from this it was conjectured in [14] that a similar bound could in four dimensions
look like the generalizations of both sides of the six-dimensional bound, i.e. in view of the

fact that the (12m, 12+m) structure generalizes in four dimensions to 1 = 6c1 t, 2 =
6c1 + t (for this cf. the anomaly cancellation condition c2(v1) + c2(v2) + af f = c2(z) and
its component 1 + 2 = 12c1 concerning the classes not pull-backed from h 4(b) for
the case of an a model with wb = 0)

1  (6 

12

12  (g)

)c1

(2.7)

let us now rst prove this in the a model with wb = 0 and then include a non-zero wb.
for this recall that the association in six dimensions of the heterotic (12m, 12+m) with
fm on the f -theory side generalizes [7] to the association of the heterotic 1 = 6c1t, 2 =

9up to the cusp curve in c1
10the  bound is treated in a toric framework in [53].

6

6c1 + t with the following structure of the f -theory base b3 as a p1 bundle over the
common (with the heterotic side) base b = b2. look at the p1 bundle as projectivization
of a vector bundle o  t with t a line bundle over b of c1(t ) = t (this generalizes
the twisting condition in the hirzebruch surface). to make actual computations let

us introduce homogeneous coordinates a, b which are sections of o(1) and o(1)  t
respectively, where o(1) is the o(1) bundle on the p1 bers of c1(o(1)) = r, say, and
r(r + t) = 0 as a, b have no common zeroes (the disjointness of the zero-section and the

section at innity in the hirzebruch surface case). adjunction gives then

and the condition

gives with b2 = r that

c1(b3) = c1 + 2r + t

(12c1(b3)  (g)b2)b2  0

12c1 + ((g)  12)t  0

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

resp. formulated in 1 = 6c1  t the bound to be proved.

now let us include the eect of a non-zero wb. from six dimensions one knows that
a heterotic ve-brane corresponds to a blow-up in the f -theory base. so here we have
to consider the impact of the ruled surface s (in the thereby modied b3) over wb in
b = b2. its contribution is

c1( b3) = c1(b3)  s

(2.11)

leading after intersection with b in the inequality above to a term wb on the left hand
side or +wb on the right hand side. on the other hand one has now that 1+wb = 6c1t
(we think already of the case 2 = 0) so that the nal bound is unchanged

1 + wb  (6 

12

12  (g)

)c1 + wb

(2.12)

2.2 heterotic arguments

as the 4d bound was guessed from a 6d expression, let us point out that it is also

possible to see the bound from an adiabatic argument. namely, assume that b2 is the
adiabatic extension of a 6d base b1, i.e. that b2 is a hirzebruch surface fn. now as
remarked in [14] one has from the investigation of [8] that one of the inequalities   i  c1
holds for some i in 2, . . . n. restricting to a bre f = p1 of fn, i.e. restricting to a k3

7

bre of z, one gets from f  c1(fn) = 2 and the 6d bound that the relevant i is the same
as occurring in 6d if one writes there the bound as proportionality to c1(b1) = 2.

yet another argument starts from the observation that the class n +  of the spectral

cover should be eective, so its image nc1 +  in the base should be eective too. now
n itself is equal to the 6  12
12(g) , where (g) = 11  n, for n = 2, 3 , respectively equals
the next bigger integer for n = 4 and is even greater (and so implying the lower bound
from the stronger spectral cover eectiveness argument   nc1) for higher n.

3 the three-dimensional case

before coming to the actual computation of e(x) let us briey review the three-

dimensional situation, i.e having a calabi-yau three-fold z which is elliptically bered

over a two-dimensional base b2. for that we reconsider rst the case of having a smooth
z, i.e the elliptic ber does not degenerate worse than i1 (resp. ii at the cusp points)
over the discriminantd. then we proceed and consider the case where the elliptic ber

has a g-singularity (g will be always one of the ade groups and we will always be in

the split case of [27]) localised over a codimension one locus in b2. in our set-up b2 will
be a hirzebruch surface fn, i.e. a p 1 bration over b1 = p 1. note that apart from
g = e8 where n = 12 (so we are in the rst column of table a.1 of [4]) we restrict
ourselves to n = 0, 1, 2 ( the rst three rows of the table mentioned). (because of our

interchange (compared to the usual convention) of the bundles one has strictly speaking

to put n = 0, 1, 2 in the formulae below.)

the ber enhancement is given as follows: the matter loci are specied in [27] and [28]

relates matter and ber enhancement (intuitively one may think for example of the 27

matter locus of e6 as located at the e7 ber enhancement points given by the collision
of the e6 line b and the i1 curve d1).

for background and notation of the elliptically bered geometry cf. appendix.

3.1

smooth case

in case that b is two-dimensional, d is a curve in b2 of class d = 12c1(b2). the
three-dimensional calabi-yau z over b2 is described by a smooth weierstrass model,
so one has only type i1 (and ii) singular bers over d which contribute to (z). the
idea of an euler number computation from the elliptic bration data is of course e( z) =
e(sing. ber)e(d). since d is a curve we have d(d  c1(b2)) = 132c2
1 (where ci =

8

ci(b2)). but d itself will be singular at those points where the divisors associated to
the classes f = 4c1(b2) and g = 6c1(b2) collide, i.e. at f  g = 24c2
1 points. at these
points d develops a cusp and the elliptic ber will be of type ii. using the standard

plucker formula, which takes the double points and cusps into account (cf.
gets e( d) = 132c2

1), and so we get

1 + 2(24c2

e(z) = e(i1)(84c2

1) = 60c2

[25]), one

(3.1)

3.2

singular case

now assume that z has a section of g-singularities localised over the base curve in

the hirzebruch surface fn = b2. consider in fn the two rational curves given of self-
intersection n resp. +n given by the zero section s0 and the section at innity s =
s0 + nf of the p1 bundle. let us localize the g bers along s0, where we have an eye on
a dual perturbative heterotic11 description. now, we can decompose the discriminant d

into two components: d = d1 + d2, where d1 denotes the component with generic i1
bers and d2 has g bers. each component is characterized by the order of vanishing of
some polynomials as d itself. denote the class of d2 by d2 = cs0, resp. f2 = as0 and
g2 = bs0. with the canonical bundle of the hirzebruch surface kfn = 2s0  (2 + n)f
we get d1 = (24  c)s0 + (24 + 12n)f , resp. f1 = (8  a)s0 + (8 + 4n)f and g1 =
(12  b)s0 + (12 + 6n)f , so describing the locus of i1 singularities.

since only singular bers contribute to (z), we get e(z) = e(d1)e(i1) + e(s0)e(g).
now d1 is a curve in the base, which has cusp singularities at f1g1 = 192 + (6n 
12)a + (4n  8)b  abn points, so applying the standard plucker formula, we nd e(d1) =
d1(d1 +kfn)+2f1g1 = 1056+(4623n)c+c2n+2f1g1. the cusps contribute with
e(ii)f1g1 to e(z); also we have to take into account that the d1 branch will intersect
the branch of g-singularities s0 in a number of points (which will modify the cusp set
f1g1 for g = in, i 

n).

e(z) =

e(i1)(cid:18)e(d1)  e(d1  s0)  f1g1)(cid:19)

11we will have 12  n resp. 12 + n instantons on the heterotic side corresponding to s0 resp. s; we

put the greater number into the second bundle where we want to span an e8 bundle

(3.2)

where m is the set of components of the intersection of d1 and s0. for example, for
a4 = i5 one has d1s0 = 4hc1t + p8c13t, so m consists of h and p ; further e(h) =
2  n, e(p ) = 16  3n and e(g) = 5, e(genh
p ) = 7 corresponding to the

h ) = 6 and e(genh

generic i5 bre, the i6 enhancement bre and the d5 enhancement ber.

let us now give a number of cases which illustrate the above formula. to do so we

proceed as follows: rst, we read o the necessary information about the base geometry

from the discriminant, then we compute the the euler characteristic of z and compare

our results with the heterotic string side.

3.2.1 e8(ii ) singularity

from the discriminant of z

 = z10

1 (g2

(12n)(z2) + o(z2

1))

(3.3)

we learn that the d1 locus has (12  n) double points which contribute to e(d1) and
which lying on the intersection points of d1 and s0, so we have to apply the plucker
formula for curves which leads to a 2(12  n) contribution to the euler number of d1.
further f1s0 = 8 and g1s0 = (12  n) and the euler number of z is given by

e(z) = 240  60n

(3.4)

let us compare this result with the heterotic string side. there we nd dimm12+n(e8) +
dimm12n(su(1)) + h1,1(k3) = 144 + 29n which contribute to the number of hyper-
multiplets further we have 248 vectors and 13  n = 1 + 12  n tensors satisfying the

gravitational anomaly equation 273  144  29n + 248 = 29nt . this leads to the pre-
diction for h2,1 resp. h1,1 of the corresponding f-theory model h2,1(z) = 152 + 28n,
h1,1(z) = 8 + 2 + 1 + 12  n = 23  n giving (z) = 240  60n which is in agreement

with our computation above.

3.2.2 es

7(iii ) singularity

here the discriminant is given by

 = z9

1(4f 3

8n(z2) + o(z1))

(3.5)

10

telling us d1s0 = 3(8  n) so that we should expect an enhancement at (8  n) points,
i.e. e(d1  s0)(e(genh)  e(g)  1) = (8  n)(e(ii )  e(iii )  1) = 0. but actually12
the bre over these points is not13 of kodaira type ii  (whose ane diagram is of euler
number 10) but consists of a chain of 8 p 1s (which is not a kodaira bre) and has euler
number 9 giving an 1(8  n) contribution to the total euler number of z. thus we nd
(note also that f1s0 = (8  n), g1s0 = (12  n))

e(z) = 284  56n

(3.6)

from the heterotic side we get

dimm12+n(e8) + dimm12n(su(2)) + h1,1(k3) = 153 + 28n = nh

(3.7)

so that nh = 153 + 28n and nv = 133 satisfying the anomaly equation 244 + 133 =
153 + 28n + 56
2 (8  n) and giving h2,1(z) = 152 + 28n and h1,1(z) = 10, thus equ. (3.6).

3.2.3 es

6(iv ) singularity

 = z8

1(27q4

6n(z2) + o(z1))

(3.8)

so we expect e(d1  s0) = d1s0/4 = (6  n) collisions between the iv  and i1 ber,
further we have f1s0 = (8  n) and g1s0 = 2(6  n). so katz/vafa collision rules give
e(d1  s0)(e(genh)  e(g)  1) = (6  n)(e(iii )  e(iv )  1) = 0 and we nd

e(z) = 300  54n

(3.9)

which can be checked on the heterotic side: dimm12+n(e8) + dimm12n(su(3)) +
h1,1(k3) = 160 + 27n = nh and nv = 78, satisfying 244 + 78 = 160 + 27n + 27(6  n)
and leading to h2,1(z) = 159 + 27n and h1,1(z) = 9.

3.3 a subtlety concerning the cusp set

before we will proceed and consider some i 

n and in examples, we have to make a digres-

sion concerning the cusp set in these examples.

the reason for that is that, contrary to the case of the ek series, now the kodaira
values a and b in f = f1 + ar, g = g1 + br do not lead by themselves to the value c;

12as pointed out by aspinwall [17]
13although a generic slice through the singularity might one lead to believe it looks like e8; but the

resolution of the threefold will not give the full e8 when one does the blow-up explicitly (cf. [29])

11

instead they would always lead to i 

0 and i0. to get actually a higher n one has to tune
the occurring expressions f1, g1 so that in the discriminant n more powers of z (the local
coordinate transversal to b1) than naively expected (i.e. 6 for the d case and 0 for the
a case) can be extracted.

recall that we have (z1 is the base variable of divisor r)

f (z1, z2) =

g(z1, z2) =

i

xi=a
xj=b

j

zi
1f8n(4i)(z2)

zj
1g12n(6j)(z2)

(3.10)

(cf. [27]).

let us consider this in the example of d5 where (a, b, c) = (2, 3, 7) and

d  z6(4f 3

1 + 27g2
1)

(3.11)

but as we have to force a z7 the coecients of z6 have to cancel which leads to the
conditions f4c12t  h2
2c1t; furthermore from the split condition (to
get really e6 and not f4) one gets g6c12t + f4c1th2c1t = q2
3c1t. altogether this leads to
an equation for d

2c1t and g6c13t  h3

d  z7[h3

2c1tq2

3c1t + o(z)]

(3.12)

similarly for i5, say, one has (a, b, c) = (0, 0, 5) and again the cancellation of the leading
terms (there are now higher cancellation conditions as well) leads to f4c14t  h4
c1t and
g6c16t  h6
c1t. all the conditions including the split condition lead to a description
by four further relevant sections besides hc1t, namely h2c1t, q3c1t, f4c1t, g6c1t and a
discriminant

d  z5h4

c1tp8c13t

(3.13)

so the fact that we have to enforce a higher power of z to be extractable leads to the
cancellation conditions which come down to f1r = 2h2c1t, g1r = 3h2c1t for the i 
n series
(for n > 0) and to f1r = 4hc1t, g1r = 6hc1t for the in series (for n > 0). this fact
then, that f1 and g1 have a component h in common, changes the actual cusp set from
f1g1 to f1g1  x  h where x is the intersection multiplicity of f1 and g1 at h (as computed
by the vanishing order of the resultant) which counts the number of times h lies in the

intersection product. so to compute x we have to determine the f1 and g1 polynomials,

12

i.e. express them in local data near the collision point d1r. this can be done by using
the more general weierstrass equation

y2 + a1xy + a3y3 = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6

(3.14)

where the ais are locally dened polynomial functions on the base as f and g (for details
see [27]). further one can express the f and g polynomial in terms of the ais

f = 

g =

3 + 4a6))

(3.15)

the local structure (orders in z) of the ais is given by [27] (we are always in the split
case)

the h-locus, related to the relevant enhancement, is given for the i series by a1 (with
the exception of i2 where not hc1t but h2c12t is relevant and where the corresponding
enhancement locus is given by b2 = a2
1 + 4a2) and for the i  series by a2 for n > 0 and
by a4 for n = 0. this is actually rened with a corresponding z power according to
t = a2,1 = a2/z for example for d5 (cf. [27]).

concerning the value of x one nds that for the in series (with two exception: x = 3
for n = 2, but this would give x = 6 if h were h2 thus tting the pattern of the i series,
and x = 8 for n = 3) with n = 4, 5, 6 it is given by x = 3n and for i 
2 it is given

0 , i 

1 , i 

by x = 0, 2, 3.

furthermore we have to note that there is another twist in the story which comes from

the fact that d1 will have a tacnode or an even higher double point when colliding with
r = s0 for the cases i4, i5, i6 at the points on d1 = r = s0 of h, that is a singular point
of the form tm + z2 = 0 with m = 4 (tacnode, for i4) resp. m = 6 for i5, i6 (after suitable
coordinate change).

from dimq(m(n1+n2)

nv = 28 vectors we nd that the anomaly equation 244 + 28 = 176 + 24n + 3  8(4  n) is
satised. thus we nd h2,1(z) = 175 + 24n and h1,1(z) = 7 and so e(z) = 336  48n

further we have to take into account the change of the cusp set since x = 2, i.e. we nd

c = f1g1  2(4  n). assuming the katz/vafa collision rules we get

the further necessary contribution 1(4  n) is explainable as follows: the enhanced

bre over these points is not (although a generic slice through the singularity might one

lead to believe it looks like e7; but the resolution of the threefold will not give the full e7
when one does the blow-up explicitly a la miranda) of kodaira type iii  (whose ane
diagram is of euler number 9) but consists of a chain of 7 p 1s (which is not a kodaira

k1(ik) singularity

42np166n for i2, by z3h3

we consider now the ik series for k = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 where the leading term of the discrim-
inant is given by z2h 2
2np16(8k)n
for ik with k = 4, 5, 6. one has always f s0 = 4(2  n), gs0 = 6(2  n) and
d1s0 = 4(2  n) + (16  (8  k)n) and the cusp set is given by c = f1g1  x(2  n)
with x the intersection multiplicity of f1 and g1 at h = 0. including the additional singu-
larity contributions (tacnode, etc.) at the h-points of d1  r (r = b1 = s0) for i4, i5, i6
considered below one gets

i4 352  44n
i5 320  50n
i6 288  54n

note that the euler numbers (cf.

[4]) match with the heterotic expectations for the

spectrum.

now let us look at the tacnode (and higher double point) singularities of d1 at h men-
tioned above (cf. in the following the explicit discriminant forms given in the appendix).

i4

note that on h the equation of d1 is given by (e := f2 + h 2)



3
4

e2(h4  2h2hz + (h 2 

4
3

e)z2) + o(z3) = 0

(3.29)

17

so the fact that we do not have a complete square structure in the leading terms (because
the expression 4
3 e) shows that we have a generic tacnode structure at h, in contrast to
the cases i5 and i6. so the 6d euler number contribution will be +4  1 = 3 (taking into
account that one has to go back to the singular model) at each of the (2  n) intersection

points of the h component of the intersection of d1 with the b1 line.

i5

note that near h the equation of d1 is given by (with e := f1h + q2)

 3hq2(h4  2h2hz + h 2z2) + (h 2(2g1h + 3f 2

1 ) +

9
4

e2)z3 + (f 3

1 + 3g1e)z4 + g2

1z5 = 0

so the complete square structure of the leading terms shows that we do not have a generic

tacnode structure, just as for i6 but in contrast to the case i4. if we replace the variable
z by w := hz  h2 the terms up to third order become (everything up to coecients)
w2 + z3  h6 + 3h4w + w2 + w3  h6 + 3h4w + w2 near (h, w) = (0, 0) which goes with
w := v  3
2 h4 to the normal form h6 + v2. so the 6d euler number contribution will be
+6  1 = 5 (taking into account that one has to go back to the singular model) at each
of the (2  n) intersection points of the h component of d1  r. one nds that one has
to adopt a rened analysis to get a missing contribution +1(2  n).

i6

note that on h the d1 equation is given by (e := 1

2f1 + f h e := f1 + f h)

 3e2(h4  2h2hz + h 2z2) + f1(

9

f he + f 2

2

f 2e2z4

(3.30)

so the complete square structure of the leading terms shows that we do not have a generic
tacnode structure, just as for i5 but in contrast to the case i4. with w := hz  h2 the
terms up to third order become (everything up to coecients) w2 +z3  h6 +3h4w +w2 +
w3  h6 + 3h4w + w2 near (h, w) = (0, 0) which goes with w := v  3
2h4 to the normal
form h6 + v2. so the 6d euler number contribution will be +6  1 = 5 (taking into
account that one has to go back to the singular model) at each of the (2  n) intersection

points of the h component of the intersection of d1 with the b1 line.

4 the four-dimensional case

in this section we start after the foregoing introductory sections with the euler number

computation in the four-dimensional case. here we give the smooth case and in the

general case the relation to the heterotic situation. in general we will have to consider

18

two types of contributions: singular bers (corresponding in codimension one to g over

b2 and i1 over d1, this is the generic situation in the discriminant surface inside b3; this
is enhanced at the matter curves in b2 and at the cusp curve c of d1 in codimension two,
and nally further enhanced at the intersection of the matter curves and the intersection

of the cusp curve (i.e. the curve of cuspidal type ii bers above) with b2 in codimension
three) on the one hand and intrinsic contributions to e(d1) from its various singularities
(the curve of intrinsic cusp singularities of d1, which will always be present, and a curve
(actually one of the matter curves, the h curve) of tacnode resp. higher double point

singularities in codimension one inside d1 and various complicated point singularities at
the points mentioned above as well as at further points detected by an analysis of the

discriminant equation).

in section 5 we will derive the contributions of the intrinsic singularity curves.

in

section 6 we begin the discussion of the codimension loci.

in section 7 we present in

a case by case discussion the various examples and further rene investigation of the

singularity contributions.

4.1

smooth case

now if b is three-dimensional, the discriminant d is a surface in b3 whose class is given
by d = 12c1(b3) resp. g = 4c1(b3) and f = 6c1(b3). in analogy to the calabi-yau
threefold case we will compute e(x) from e(sing.f iber)e(d). for a smooth d we can
obtain from the exact sequence 0  td  tb3|d  nd|b3
(note that nd|b3

 0 the adjunction formulas

= o(d)|d)

c1(b3)|d = c1(d) + d|d

c2(b3)|d = c2(d) + c1(d)d|d

which leads to the euler characteristic of a non-singular d

e(d) = c2(b3)d  c1(b3)d2 + d3

(4.1)

(4.2)

but d will be singular along a curve c = f g and we expect a plucker correction

to e(d). for c = f g we can derive the euler characteristic of c from the above

exact sequence by restricting to c and, with the normal bundle of c in b3 given by
nc|b3 = (o(f )  o(g))|c, we get

e(c) = c1(b3)f g  (f + g)f g = 216c3

1(b3) = 1296c2

1  432t2

(4.3)

19

using the generalised plucker formulas derived in the next section we nally get the

corrected euler characteristic of d

e(d) = c2(b3)d  c1(b3)d2 + d3 + 2(e(c)  dc)

= 288 + 576c3

1(b3) = 288 + 3456c2

1 + 1152t2

(4.4)

and so

e(x) = e(i1)(e(d)  e(c))

+e(ii)e(c)

= 288 + 360c1(b3)3 = 288 + 2160c2

1 + 720t2

(4.5)

4.2

singular case

after reproducing the euler characteristic for smooth x, we will consider the case of

having a section of g-singularities located over a surface d2 in b3. let us localize the
g bers along the zero section of the p1 bundle b3 over b2, whose class we denoted
above by r. following the procedure from above, we decompose the discriminant d

into d = d1 + d2 where again d denotes the component with i1 bers and d2 carrys
g bers. with d2 = cr, f2 = ar resp. g2 = br and the canonical bundle of the base
kb3 = c1  2r  t, we get the classes d1 = 12c1 + (24  c)r + 12t, f1 = 4c1 + (8  a)r + 4t
and g1 = 6c1 + (12  b)r + 6t which describe our i1 locus.

as we want to check our results on the euler number of the f -theory four-fold via

n3 = n5 with a corresponding heterotic computation let us now assume, as we want to
use the computations of n5 from the the spectral cover method for su(n) bundles [7],
that heterotically an su(n)  e8 bundle (v1, v2) is given and let us look for the rst few
non-trivial (the case n = 1 of g = e8 is treated below also; furthermore some other
cases of g, mainly in the in series, will be discussed; this requires in the case of i2, i3
the use of e7, e6 bundle v , whose second chern class is computed in appendix (b) from
parabolic methods) cases where the gauge group g is simple (let now v := v1).

there h 1(z, v ) was localized on the curve an = 0 (meaning x = , the zero point in
the group law; cf. sect. (b.1), note that ai is of class   ic1) and h 1(z, 2v ) on the
common zeroes of p and q in the representation w = p (x) + yq(x) = 0 of the spectral
equation (meaning that y and y (the inverse bundle) are spectral points in eb). for
example for g = a4 = i5 one has p = a0 + a2x + a4x2, q = a3 + a5x.

so, after we will have computed e(x 4) in the following sections, we will compare with

the heterotic expectation derived in the introduction.

5 plucker formulas for surfaces with curves of sin-

gularities

as we will have to compute a number of times the euler number of a surface component

of the discriminant surface in b3 we give here the general computation. so let d be a
surface in b3 with a curve of singularities along the curve c. our applications below will
include a curve of cusps resp. tacnodes and higher double points. the cusp curve will

21

always be present, while the tacnodes and higher double points occur for g = a3 = i4
resp. g = i5, i6. in the actual applications the singularity will be worse at special points
on the curve, a possibility which we exclude here.

in subsection one we derive the contribution to the euler number in the general case of

a curve of singularities of multiplicity k, resolved by one blow-up. in subsection two we

prove some main formulae used in this derivation and give an outlook on a closely related

application of this technical set-up. in subsection three we specialise to the case of the

cusp curve; here we nd the contribution for the smooth case already used in section 4.

in subsection four we proceed to the case of a tacnode curve which makes two successive

blow-ups necessary. subsection ve treats the case of an even higher double point with

three blow-ups.

5.1 the general case of a curve of singularities of multiplicity

k, resolved by one blow-up

let k denote the multiplicity of a surface d (which will be our surface d1 in the appli-
cations) along c (being 2 in the two mentioned examples). we assume at rst that the

singularity is resolved after one blow-up. so one rst blows up c in b3, producing a
three-fold  : b3  b3. then one has for the total transform d

d = d + ke

(5.1)

with the proper transform d and the exceptional divisor e, a ruled surface over c. one
has the relations (which are proved below)

c1( b3) = c1(b3)  e

c2( b3) = (c2(b3) + c)  c1(b3)  e

(5.2)

furthermore the fact that, after blowing up a (itself nonsingular) point on a surface, the
self-intersection of the exceptional p 1 is 1 generalizes essentially to a relation e2 =
c up to a correction term af where f is the bre of the ruled surface e over c (so
e  f = 1) and a a number determined by the exterior geometry of c in b3 (again
these relations are proved below)

e2 = c  e3 f

e3 = zc

c1(nb3c) = (c1(b3)c  e(c))

(5.3)

22

with these formulas one gets from the usual formula for a smooth surface c2( d) =
c2( b3) d  c1( b3) d2 + d3 that

c2( d) = c2(b3)d  c1(b3)d2 + d3 + k

(5.4)

with the correction term (of course 1 = 0 and one has a factor (k  1))

k = (k  1)[(3k + 1)cd + kc1(b3)c  k2e3]

= (k  1)[(3k + 1)cd + k(k + 1)c1(b3)c  k2e(c)]

(5.5)

this is seen as follows

c2 d = c2( b3) d  c1( b3) d2 + d3

= c2(b3)d + cd  kc1(b3)c

c1(b3)d2 + k2c1(b3)c + 2kcd + k2e3

+d3  3k2dc  k3e3

in particular for our case of interest k = 2 one has

2 = 7dc + 2c1(b3)c  4e3

5.2 the chern classes of blow-ups

let us now prove the relations used above

()

c2( b3) = f (c2(b3) + c)  f c1(b3)e

() e2 = c  e3f

consider the following blow-up diagram for x a non-singular variety in y

(5.6)

(5.7)

x

gy

x

j y

y

i y

f

further let n be the normal bundle to x in y with rankn = d, the codimension of x
in y , and identify x with p (n), so n x
y = o(1). then from the above diagram one
derives [46] the relation

c2( y )  f c2(y ) = j((d  1)gc1(x) +

d(d  3)

2

o(1) + (d  2)gc1(n))

(5.8)

23

5.2.1 the case d = 2

for d = 2 one has

c2( y )  f c2(y ) = jgc1(x)  [ x][ x]

= jgc1(x) + f i[x]  jgc1(nxy )

= f i[x]  jg(c1(x) + c1(nxy ))

= f i[x]  jg(c1(y )|x)

= f i[x]  f c1(y )[ x]

(5.9)

note in the second line we made use of

f i[x] = jc1(f )

= jgc1(nxy )  [ x][ x]

(5.10)

with f = gn/n x
y = b3 and [ x] = e resp. i[x] = c we arrive at our expression ().

y and in for the last line one has jgiu = f u[ x]. so identifying

for the second relation let us consider again

f i[x] = jc1(f )

= jgc1(nxy )  [ x][ x]

= degnjg[pt]  [ x][ x]

= degn l  [ x][ x]

(5.11)

where l = g[pt] denotes the class of a ber in g : p (n)  x. then from [ x]2 
[ x]gc1(n))|[ x] = 0 we get

[ x]3 = [ x]|[ x]gc1(n)

= [ x]|[ x]degng[pt]

= degn l  [ x]|[ x]

= degn

(5.12)

so that f i[x] = [ x]3 l  [ x]2 which is what we were looking for in ().

24

5.2.2 the case d = 3

let us give an outlook on a further application of this technique.
in connection with
our main theme it is also of interest to compute c2(x 4). first this gives in principle
an alternative way to compute the euler number of x by making use of the relation
2(x 4) = 480 + e(x 4)/3 (cf. [6]). secondly c2(x) is of interest because of the congruence
c2
relation between the four-ux and c2(x)/2 (cf. [21] and appendix (c)).

consider now a calabi-yau 4fold z embedded (via its weierstrass representation) into

an 5 dimensional ambient space y , then it follows from adjunction (since z is a smooth

divisor in y ) that

and thus

c1(y )|z = c1(z) + z|z

c2(y )|z = c2(z) + c1(z)z|z

c2(z) = c2(y )|z

(5.13)

(5.14)

further recall that c(y ) = c(b)(1 + r)(1 + r + 2c1)(1 + r + 3c1) from which we get

c1(y ) = 6c1 + 3r

c2(y ) = 11c2

1 + c2 + 13rc1 + 3r2

(5.15)

and setting r2 = 3rc1 (i.e. restricting to z) then leads to the expression in the smooth
case

c2(z) = c2(y )z = 11c2

1 + c2 + 4rc1

(5.16)

now let us consider the simplest more complicated case, that of an singularity of

codimension one which is a1. in order to do so let us rst analyse the change of c2 of
the ambient space. this is computed as follows

c2( y )  f c2(y ) = jg(2c1(x) + c1(nxy ))

= jg(c1(x) + c1(y )|x)

= jgc1(x)  jgic1(y )

= jgc1(x)  f c1(y )[ x]

(5.17)

now we have to compute using z = z  2[ x]

c2( z) = c2( y )| z = f c2(y ) z  f c1(y )[ x] z  jgc1(x) z

25

= f c2(y ) z  2f c2(y )[ x]  f c1(y )[ x] z + 2f c1(y )[ x]

jgc1(x) z

= c2(y )z  2f c1(y )[ x]2  jgc1(x) z

= c2(y )z  2c1(y )r  jgc1(x) z

= 11c2

1 + c2 + 4rc1 + 2(6rc1  9rc1)  jgc1(x) z

= 11c2

1 + c2  2rc1  jgc1(x) z

(5.18)

showing the crucial deviation term jgc1(x) z relative to the smooth case.

5.3 cusp curve

so for example for the cusp curve case (where also c2( d) = c2(d) as, in contrast to the
double point case, no points are identied in blowing down d back to its singular version
d) one gets that

cusp = 7cd + 6c1(b3)c  4c1(c)

(5.19)

note also that for the cases where the cusp curve is given by the uncorrected f1g1
(so this includes the smooth case, the pure gauge group case of singularities only in

codimension 1, where still d1 and therefore c is separated from b2, and furthermore the
e series in general)

 7cd + 6c1(b3)c  4c1(c) = 2cd + 2c1(c) + 6c1(b3)c  5cd  6c1(c)

= 2cd + 2c1(c) + 6c1(n c)  5cd

= 2cd + 2c1(c) + (6(f1 + g1)  5d1)c

= 2cd + 2c1(c) + ((6(f + g)  5d)  (6(a + b)  5c)r)c

= 2cd + 2c1(c) + dcr

(5.20)

(note that this d is d1 in our application) where the term d := 5c  6(a + b) equals
4, 3, 2 for e8, e7, e6 and of course zero for the smooth case. this shows explicitely
the deviation 2cd+dcr used above in the smooth case to the naive adiabatic extension

2c1(c) of the one-dimensional plucker formula.

26

5.4 tacnode curve

now we come to the more complicated case of the tacnode, where we need a second

blow-up, as the rst blow-up just brings one to the case of an ordinary double point

(having distinct tangents as opposed to the tacnode). this second blow-up is along the

well-dened (as the two tangent directions of the tacnode points of d along c coincide)
proper transform c of c under the rst blow-up. note that c = e(1) d = e(1)( d2e(1)).
note also that at the end of the procedure we have to go back to the singular model d

and to get its euler number we still have to subtract e(c) as in the second resolution step
the double points became separated, i.e. (with c2(d)ord = c2(b3)d  c1(b3)d2 + d3)

c2( d) = c2(d)ord + tacn

c2(d) = c2(d)ord + tacn  e(c)

(5.21)

in other words the corrections cusp, tacn refer in our conventions to the desingularized
model (just as in the ordinary plucker formulas).

here one gets (up to codimension 3 contributions)

tacn = 21cd + 26c1(b3)c  20e(c)

(5.22)

to prove this let us follow the two steps of the resolution. clearly in the second

resolution step we are again back in the case of a curve of ordinary double points.

c2( d) = c2( b3) d  c1( b3) d

2

+ d

= c2( b3) d  c1( b3) d2 + d3

(1)

7( d  2e(1)) c + 2(c1(b3)  e(1)) c  4e3

(5.23)

giving this time

tacn = 7dc + 2c1(b3)c  4e3
(1)

7 d c + 2c1(b3) c + 12e(1) c  4e3
(2)

(5.24)

now, concerning the four new terms in the second line, note that one has, concerning

the rst three of them, that

d c = de(1)( d  2e(1)) = 2dc

27

c1b3 c = c1b3e( d  2e(1)) = 2c1(b3)c

e(1) c = e2

(1)( d  2e(1)) = cd  2e3

(1)

(5.25)

on the other hand concerning the last new term e3
c1(n c| b3), whereas e3
latter, note that the short exact sequence

(2) =
(1) = c1(nc|b3). now, to express the former in terms of the

(2) one has again that e3

0  n c|e(1)  n c| b3  ne(1)| b3  0

gives

c1(n c| b3) = c1(n c|e(1)) + c1(ne(1)| b3)

where the rst term on the right hand side is evaluated as c 2 in e(1), i.e. as

(5.26)

(5.27)

c1(n c|e(1)) = d2e(1) = ( d  2e(1))2e(1) = 4dc + 4e3

(1)

(5.28)

similarly the second term is c1(t ) = e(1)|e(1) of the tautological bundle t over e(1),
restricted to c = d|e(1), i.e.

c1(ne(1)|b3) = de2

(1) = ( d  2e(1))e2

(1) = dc  2e3
(1)

(5.29)

so that one gets

so nally

e3

(2) = c1(n c| b3)

= (c1(n c|e(1)) + c1(ne(1)| b3))

= (4dc + 4e3

(1)  dc  2e3

= 3dc  2e3
(1)

(5.30)

tacn = 7dc + 2c1(b3)c  4e3

= 33cd + 6c1(b3)c  28e3

= 21cd + 6c1(b3)c  20e3

= 21cd + 26c1(b3)c  20e(c)

5.5

curve of higher double points

one gets

(5.32)

in the concrete application in the i series discriminant one has along the h curve an
equation for d1 of the form (x2  z)2 + z3 where we have written x for h. one nds in
the explicit resolution process further contributions at codimension three loci inside the

h curve which we will not need to write down.

6 on the codimension 3 loci

consider the cases d5 = i 
series: rst that without further tuning the i 

1 and i5. there are two new features compared to the ek
n and the in series would remain at n = 0

(cf. sect. (3.3)), and secondly the existence of two matter curves.

what we want to see in the following is that actually the cohomology classes of the

two codimension 3 loci, i.e. of cr and the intersection of the matter curves h and p , are

proportional; more precisely that cr is a multiple of hp .

now one has

(4f 3

1 + 27g2

1 = 0) = dold = d1 + nr

(6.1)

where n is the subscript in the i 

n and the in series, i.e. the number of powers of z one

can extract from the left hand side.

furthermore one has the decomposition of d1r into the matter (=enhancement) curves

(p means here our q in the i 

1 case)

d1r = h + p

(6.2)

29

where d1r is also given by

one has a corresponding decomposition

doldr = d1r  nt

(f1 = 0 = g1) = cold = c + xhr

where x = ordhres(f1, g1), so that one also gets (with  = ordhf1,  = ordhg1)

cr = h  h + xht

(6.3)

(6.4)

(6.5)

6.1 the in series

for the cases n = 4, 5, 6 which show the general i series pattern one nds the following.

there is f1r = 4h, g1r = 6h and one nds

x = 3n

cr = 3h(8h + nt) = 3hp8c1(8n)t

(6.6)

(6.7)

let us now understand why cr is indeed a multiple of hp , considered as cohomology

classes, i.e. why the used cohomological relation 8h + nt = p is not accidental. for
i0 one has that doldr = 12c1  12t = 12hc1t. for i5 one has doldr = d1r  5t =
4hc1t + p8c13t  5t and therefore 12h = 4h + p  5t or 8h + 5t = p . similarly for in.

for the case n = 2 one has f1r = 2h, g1r = 3h and with x = 3 one nds cr =
2hp . for n = 3 with f1r = 4h, g1r = 6h

2h  3h + 3ht = 3h(2h + t) = 3h(4c1  3t) = 3
and x = 8 one nds cr = 8h(3h + t) = 8h(3c1  2t) = 8

3h(9c1  6t).

6.2 the i 

n series

the case d4 = i 
0 is somewhat exceptional as here one has f1r = 2h2c1t, g1r = 3p2c1t
with dierent polynomials of the same degree (whereas for n > 0 one has g1r = 3h and
p will represent a dierent cohomology class giving the other matter curve) and a z3

symmetry related to d4 triality. this manifests itself in the discriminant as follows

d1r = 12c1  6t = a(0)

4c12t + a(1)

4c12t + a(2)

4c12t

(6.8)

4c12t = (h2

2c1t + ip 2

2c1t = 0) with i = 0, 1, 2 and 3 = 1. then one has with

where a(i)
x = 0

cr = 2h  3p

30

(6.9)

now note that the locus of simultaneous vanishing of h and p is also the locus of inter-
section of the a(i).

for i 

n with n > 0 is f1r = 2h2c1t, g1r = 3h2c1t. for d5 = i 

1 one has

d1r = 12c1  5t = 3h2c1t + 2q3c1t

(6.10)

and with x = 2 one nds

cr = 2h  3h + 2ht = 2h(3h + t) = 2h  2q

(6.11)

where 2h occurs in cr actually on the level of divisors.

for d6 = ii 

2 one has (for the parameter r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 being 0 (cf. the discussion of

d6 in the six-dimensional case and [27])) that

d1r = (12c1 + 16r + 12t)r = 12c1  4t = 2h2c1t + 2p4c1t

(6.12)

and with x = 3 one has

cr = 2h  3h + 3ht = 3h(2h + t) = 3hp4c1t

so one has that for the i 

n cases with n = 0, 1, 2

x = 6

n

2 + n

(6.13)

(6.14)

cr = h(6h + xt) =

12

2 + n

h  ((2 + n)c1  t) =

12

2 + n

hp(2+n)c1t

(6.15)

let us again see why cr arises as a multiple of hp . for i 
6(2c1  t). for i 
or 3h + t = 2q as we wanted to prove. similarly for i 
2h2c1t + 2p4c1t  2t and so 6h = 2h + 2p  2t or 4h + 2t = 2p resp. 2h + t = p .

0 one has doldr = 12c1  6t =
1 one has doldr = d1r  t = 3h + 2q  t and therefore 6h = 3h + 2q  t
2 one has doldr = d1r  2t =

let us nally, for example in the case of d5, come to the question whether actually
the two sets c  r and h  q coincide. from equ. (3.20) it follows that 48f1h + 864g1 =
z(q2  1
2 f1h) + o(z2) so if we approach c  r coming from the outside of b2 = r = (z = 0)
we nd 0 = q2  1
2f1h
resp. 0 = q2 for c  r as it will lie in the divisor h anyway.

2 f1h + o(z) which goes in the limit z  0 to the condition 0 = q2  1

7 the explicit computation of e(x 4)

now, nally, we come to our main computation announced in the introduction. this

euler number computation for the various cases is treated in subsection (7.2). in sub-

section (7.1) we make contact with a formula given in [13] (for the case of singularities

31

in codimension one only) which was guessed there from a list of values based on a com-

puter analysis in a toric framework. the case of pure codimension one is also of interest
because in this case the expression (2) = 2n(  nc1) for an su(n) bundle will
vanish as   nc1 = (6  n)c1  t = 0 for15 g = e8, e7, e6, a4 and t = (6  n)c1 with
n = 0, 2, 3, 5 . finally in subsection (7.3) we note an observation relating euler number

values in neighbouring cases of certain higgs chains.

7.1 euler number formula for codimension one

a byproduct of our analysis is the proof of an euler number formula for elliptic calabi-

yau fourfolds for which the elliptic ber degenerates over the generic codimension one

locus b2 in the calabi-yau base b3. this formula was rst written down in [13] based
on a toric computer analysis. the formula suitably rewritten reads

e(x4) = 288 + 360zb3

c3

1(b3)  r(g)c(g)(c(g) + 1)zb2

c2
1(b2)

(7.1)

where r(g) and c(g) are the rank resp. coxeter number of the gauge group g. now

(with b3 = fk,m,n the generalized hirzebruch surface of base b2 = fk; below we consider
yet another example) using the fact that c3
1 + 2t2 and that we can express t
in data of fk,m,n so that t = m[b] + n[f ] with t2 = 2mn  m2k where [b]2 = k and also
noting that t2 = 2n2 = n2
1 from implementing the codimension one condition m = n
and k = 0, we can rewrite the above formula as

1(b3) = 6c2

4 c2

e(x4) = 288 + (180(12 + n2)  r(g)c(g)(c(g) + 1))c2

1(b)

(7.2)

the case of purely codimension one (ber) singularity (i.e. especially without matter

curves; so this is a separation case what concerns the relative position of the two dis-

criminant components b2 and d1) is realizable for g = e8, e7, e6, d4, a2 over b2 = f0
with n = m = 12, 8, 6, 4, 3. in [13] the authors were restricted to reexive polyhedra

and thus excluding the e7 case. however, using naively the above formula leads to a
prediction for e7 which will be vindicated by our computation which therefore gives
an independent check of this formula. moreover, we also nd agreement for the cases

indicated in the following table (always assuming the (pseudo-)separation case)

15the case g = a4 is only a pseudo-separation case between b2 and d1 as only one (h) of the two
matter curves is turned o cohomologically, but note that over the other matter curve p the enhancement

is additive, leading from i5 to i6, so that the euler number computation is not eectively disturbed, cf.
section (7.1); note that by contrast in the case g = d5 the choice n = 4 and so t = 2c1 turns o again
the h2c1t matter curve and again one has the additivity of the enhancement over the other matter curve
q but this time there is an intrinsic codimension three locus left over (see below).

let us make some remarks:

a series

the codimension one condition is established by setting t = c1 or equivalently n = 2
the last footnote). note that in [13] the a2 singularity was
(pseudo-separation, cf.
specied by n = 3, i.e. t = 3/2c1 and therefore one has e(x4) = 288 + 3756c2
1 which
matches our computation too.

d series

in the d series we nd only for g = d4 a codimension one condition which is t = 2c1
resp. n = 4.

e series

the codimension one condition is here established by setting t = 3c1, 4c1, 6c1 resp. n =
6, 8, 12 for e6, e7, e8.

as a last point we remark that for the choice of b2 = p 2 of table (6.3) of [13] we nd

also agreement with our formulae given below.

7.2 the cases

7.2.1 e8(ii ) singularity

now, from our above analysis we see that e(d1)ord = c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2
1 receives
two corrections (in later cases more from codimension three contributions). the rst one

1 + d3

is coming from the fact that d has a cusp curve c = f1g1 but we have also to take
into account that d is double along t = d1  r (of class 6c1  t related to g1(z = 0))
and has to be resolved (note that this is a real resolution in contrast to the case of the

cusp curve where the resolution is only an intermediate computational step to get the

contribution of the singular geometry).

let us rst compute the contributions from ber singularities (for the general set-up of

the computation involving ber and intrinsic singularities cf. the introduction to section

33

4)

e(x) = 1(e(d1)  e(c))

+2e(c)

+10e(b2)

(7.3)

then, the intrinsic singularities of d1 are computed as (where c  r is a special codi-
mension three locus)

e(d1) = c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 + double + cusp + cr

(7.4)

which can be derived as follows. one has

c2( d1) = c2( b3) d1  c1( b3) d1

2

3

+ d1

= c2( b3) d1  c1( b3) d1

2 + d1

3  7 d1 c + 2c1 b3 c  4e3

(2)

= ((c2(b3) + t )  c1(b3)e(1))( d1  2e(1))

(c1(b3)  e(1))( d1  2e(1))2

+( d1  2e(1))3

7( d1  2e(1)) c + 2(c1(b3)  e(1)) c  4e3
(2)

= c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1  7d1t + 2c1(b3)t  4e3
(1)

7 d1 c + 14e(1) c + 2c1(b3) c  2e(1) c  4e3
(2)

(7.5)

using c = c  #(c  r) f with f the ber of e(1) we nd

d1 c = d1( c  #(c  r) f ) = d1 c = d1c

e(1) c = e(1)( c  #(c  r) f ) = #(c  r)

c1(b3) c = c1(b3)( c  #(c  r) f ) = c1(b3)c

e3

(2) = (c1( b3)c  e(c)) = (c1(b3)c  e(c)) + #(c  r)

(7.6)

which then leads to

c2( d1) = c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 + double + cusp + cr

so altogether

c2( d1) = 168 + 1702c2

1 + 1760c1t + 576t2 + (12  4)#(c  r)

34

(7.7)

(7.8)

and using

we nd

c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 = 168 + 5434c2

1 + 4670c1t + 1588t2

e(c) = 684c2

1  648c1t  216t2

10e(b2) = 120  10c2
1

double = 2(29c1  2t)(6c1  t)

cusp = 3384c2

1  2992c1t  1008t2

cr = (12  4)#(c  r)

#(c  r) = cr = 4c1(6c1  t)

(7.9)

e(x) = 288 + 1008c2

1 + 1112c1t + 360t2 + (12  4)cr

(7.10)

which leads to agreement when comparing with the heterotic side where one has

24n5 = 288 + 1200c2

1 + 1080c1t + 360t2

(7.11)

finally we remark that this formula also reproduces the computation for the case

b2 = f0 and t = 0[b] + 12[f ] in table (6.4) of [13].

7.2.2 e7(iii ) singularity

here we have again to take into account the subtlety concerning the bre enhancement
along the matter (=enhancement) curve t of class 4c1  t related to f1(z = 0) mentioned
in the six-dimensional analysis.

e(x) = 1((e(d1)  e(c)  e(t ) + #(c  r))

+2(e(c)  cr)

+9(e(b2)  e(t ))

+9(e(t )  #(c  r))

+a#(c  r)

= e(d1) + e(c) + 9e(b2)  e(t ) + (a  10)#(c  r)

(7.12)

with

e(d1) = c1(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 + cusp

35

= 180 + 2133c2

1 + 1646c1t + 583t2

e(c) = 762c2

1  629c1t  217t2

9e(b2) = +108  9c2
1

e(t ) = (3c1  t)(4c1  t)

c  r = (6c1  t)(4c1  t) cr = #(c  r)

(7.13)

so we nd

e(x) = 288 + 1134c2

1 + 1110c1t + 357t2 + a#(c  r)

(7.14)

now comparing with the heterotic side where one has

24n5 = 288 + 1350c2

1 + 1020c1t + 366t2

(7.15)

one is lead from e = 24n5  e(x) where

e = (9  a)(6c1  t)(4c1  t) = (9  a)#(c  r)

(7.16)

to a prediction a = 9 for the euler number a of the ber conguration over the codi-

mension three locus c  r.

7.2.3 e6(iv ) singularity

now one has with the matter (=enhancement curve) t of class q3c1t related to g1(z =
0) = q2

e(x) = 1((e(d1)  e(c)  e(t ) + #(c  r))

+2(e(c)  #(c  r))

+8(e(b2)  e(t ))

+9(e(t )  #(c  r))

+a#(c  r)

= e(d1) + e(c) + 8e(b2) + (a  10)#(c  r)

(7.17)

with

e(d1) = c1(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 + cusp

= 192 + 2300c2

1 + 1552c1t + 596t2

36

e(c) = 822c2

1  602c1t  220t2

8e(b2) = +96  8c2
1

e(t ) = (2c1  t)(3c1  t)

#(c  r) = (3c1  t)(4c1  t), cr = 2#(c  r)

(7.18)

(where in the last line one has to take into account that g1r = 2q from the split condition
g1(z = 0) = q2) so we nd

e(x) = 288 + 1470c2

1 + 950c1t + 376t2 + a#(c  r)

(7.19)

if we compare this with

24n5 = 288 + 1386c2

1 + 999c1t + 369t2

(7.20)

we nd a prediction for a from the vanishing of

e = (7  a)(3c1  t)(4c1  t) = (7  a)#(c  r)

(7.21)

7.2.4 d4(i 

0 ) singularity

let us start with the relevant cohomology classes resp. divisors

f1 = 4c1 + 6r + 4t  f1r = 2h

g1 = 6c1 + 9r + 6t  g1r = 3p

d1 = 12c1 + 18r + 12t  d1r = a(0) + a(1) + a(2)

(7.22)

where h = 2c1t and p = 2c1t and a(i)
2c1t = 0) with i = 0, 1, 2 and
3 = 1 and the last decomposition holds not only on the level of cohomology classes but
actually on the level of divisors as seen from the equation d1 = (a(0)a(1)a(2) +o(z) = 0).

2c1t+ip 2

4c12t = (h2

now we have

so

f1g1 = cold = cnew

(7.23)

c = 24(c1 + t)(c1 + 2t) + 6t(3r + 4t)

cr = 6hp = 6(2c1  t)2

(7.24)

37

further we have

e(d1) = c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 + cusp

= 216 + 7062c2

1 + 3642c1t + 1764t2 + cusp

(7.25)

one has cusp = 4512c2
960c2

1  2292c1t  1128t2 where we used e(c) = (c1  f1  g1)f1g1 =

1  498c1t  240t2 and altogether e(d1) = 216 + 1584c2

1 + 852c1t + 396t2 and so

e(x4) = e(d1) + e(c) + 6(12  c2
1)

= 288 + 1584c2

1 + 852c1t + 396t2

(7.26)

this is in agreement with the computation e(x4) = 39264 of [13] for b3 = f0,4,4 which
means b2 = f0 and so c1 = (2, 2) and t = (4, 4). the other choice t = (0, 4) and
c1 = (2, 2) with e(x4) = 19680 given there leads if one includes in the above formula an
ber enhancement k over the matter curves e(x4) = 19776 + 3  16(k  6) to a prediction
k = 4, i.e. an eect similar to the cases of e7 and d6 where one did not have the naive
additivity of the collision rules.

7.2.5 d5(i 

1 ) singularity

now one has

f1 = 4c1 + 6r + 4t  f1r = 2h

g1 = 6c1 + 9r + 6t  g1r = 3h

d1 = 12c1 + 17r + 12t  d1r = 3h + 2q

(7.27)

where h = 2c1  t and q = 3c1  t and the last decomposition holds not only on the
level of cohomology classes but actually on the level of divisors as seen from the equation
d1 = (h3q2 + o(z) = 0).

now just as

(4f 3

1 + 27g2

1 = 0) = d1 + r

we will have a decomposition, again actually on the level of divisors,

f1g1 = cold = cnew + 2hr

(7.28)

(7.29)

where cnew (which we denote simply by c in the following) is the true cusp curve of d1
we are interested in.

38

so

cold = 6(4(c1 + t)2 + 3r(4c1 + t)) = 24(c1 + t)2 + 18r(4c1 + t)

c = f1g1  2(2c1  t)r = 24(c1 + t)2 + (68c1 + 20t)r

cr = 2h  3h + 2ht = 2h(3h + t) = 2h  2q = 4(2c1  t)(3c1  t)

#(c  r) = #(h  q) = hq

(7.30)

where in the third line both factors occur not only as cohomology classes but even as

divisors: for the part 2h this follows from the construction of c and for the part 2q we

saw this in section 6. note also that not only ch  cr but that they are actually equal

as sets. the precise multiplicity is given by c2h = cr as the part 2h occurs in the cr

not only as cohomology class but even as divisor. so ch = 2pq.

we proceed now in two steps: rst we compute the intrinsic singularity corrections in

e(d1), then we collect the ber enhancements.

now e(d1) is given by (up to contributions from point singularities of d1 considered

below)

e(d1)ord + cusp = c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 + cusp

= 204 + 6655c2

1 + 4004c1t + 1684t2 + cusp

(7.31)

one has cusp = 7cd1 + 6c1(b3)c  4e(c) where the rst two terms are 7cd1 +
6c1(b3)c = 7872c2

1  4724c1t  1988t2. now f1g1 = cold = 2hr + c so

2ar(cold) = 2ar(2h) + e(c)  2ar(2hc)

(7.32)

now 2ar(cold) = (c1 + 2r + t)cold  (f1 + g1)cold = (960c2
with 2ar(2h) = 2h(2h  c1) = (12c2

1  14c1t + 4t2) that

1 + 498c1t + 240t2) giving

and so

and altogether

e(c) = 2ar(cold)  2ar(2h) + 2(c2h)

= 2ar(cold)  2ar(2h) + 8hq

= (900c2

1 + 552c1t + 228t2)

cusp = 4272c2

1  2516c1t  1076t2

(7.33)

(7.34)

e(d1)ord + cusp = 204 + 2383c2

1 + 1488c1t + 608t2

(7.35)

39

let us now come to the discussion of the codim 3 contributions. d1 is given by
h3
2c1tq2

3c1t + s12c14tz + o(z2) where

s12c14t = h2(

3
4

f 2
1 + 2g1h + 3f0h2)  3f1hq2 + q4

(7.36)

let us now investigate what happens if, when we are lying on one of the two matter

curves h or q, in addition s vanishes, so that the leading terms for the equation of d1
becomes there h3 + sz + z2 resp. q2 + sz + z2 and we can expect a singularity at h  s
resp. q  s.

hq and hs  q s. on the other hand q s implies only h2( 3

now, on closer inspection, one notices that h  q  s and h  s  q; therefore h  s =
1 +2g1h+3f0h2) = 0,
i.e. we do not necessarily come to lie on h, there is still another divisor r8c12t with
qs = q(2h + r) relevant. so one has a disjoint decomposition q  s = (q  h)  (q  r)

4f 2

and we will actually consider the loci h  q = h  s and q  r = (q  s)\(h  q) where

the local forms of the singularities of d1 are respectively

hx  qy  x3y2 + (x2 + xy2 + y4)z + z2

qy  rx  y2 + z(x + y2 + y4) + z2  y2 + zx + z2  y2 + x2 + z2

(7.37)

so at # h  q = hq resp. # ((q  s)\(h  q)) = # q  r = qr = q(s  2h) = 4q2  2hq
points one has an singularity of weighted homogeneous standard form x4 + y8 + z2 (as

the dening equation is of weights (2, 1, 4) in (x, y, z)) resp. an a1 singularity which lead

to corrections  resp.  to the euler number of the singular surface d1 or in general
to a correction  where  is the colength (which is nite as the singularity is isolated)

of the jacobian ideal (being also the euler number of the milnor bre minus 1). so

 = 1  3  7 = 21 and  = 1.

now let us come to the ber enhancements. now one has c  r = h  q and

#(c  r) = hq

e(c  h  q) = e(c) + e(h) + e(q)  hq

(7.38)

giving (l and k parametrize the ber enhancements at the codimension three loci)

e(x) = 1(e(d1)  e(c)  e(h)  e(q) + hq)

+2(e(c)  hq)

+7(e(b2)  e(h)  e(q) + hq)

+8(e(h)  hq + e(q)  hq  rq)

40

+lhq + krq

= e(d1) + e(c) + 7e(b2)

+(l  10)hq + (k  8)rq

= e(d1) + e(c) + 7e(b2)

+(l  2k + 6)hq + (k  8)4q2

(7.39)

e(d1) = e(d1)ord + cusp  2hq + hq + rq

= e(d1)ord + cusp + (  2  2)hq + 4q2

= e(d1)ord + cusp  21hq  4q2

(7.40)

with

one gets

e(x) = e(d1)ord + cusp + e(c) + 7e(b2)

+(l  31)hq + (k  9)4q2

= 288 + 1476c2

1 + 936c1t + 380t2

+(l  31)hq + (k  9)4q2

= 288 + 1476c2

1 + 936c1t + 380t2  8q2

+(l  31)hq + (k  9 + 2)4q2

where in the last equation the rst line matches with the heterotic expectation

24n5 = 288 + 1404c2

1 + 984c1t + 372t2

giving corresponding predictions16 from the vanishing of the other terms.

(7.41)

(7.42)

7.2.6 d6(i 

2 ) singularity

this time one has

f1 = 4c1 + 6r + 4t  f1r = 2h

16note that the form of deviation of the f -theory result from the heterotic result is already a non-
trivial check since we have to tune only two coecients to match a quadratic expression in c1 and t with
three coecients.

41

g1 = 6c1 + 9r + 6t  g1r = 3h

d1 = 12c1 + 16r + 12t  d1r = 12c1  4t = 2h + 2p4c1t

(7.43)

where h = 2c1  t and p = 4c1  t and the last decomposition holds not only on the
level of cohomology classes but actually on the level of divisors as seen from the equation
d1 = (h2p 2 + o(z) = 0).

cold = 24(c1 + t)2 + 18r(4c1 + t)

c = f1g1  3(2c1  t)r = 24(c1 + t)2 + (66c1 + 21t)r

cr = 3(2c1  t)(4c1  t) = 3hp

#(c  r) = hp

(7.44)

the cohomology classes of the two codimension 3 terms cr and hp are again propor-

tional. note also that not only ch  cr but that they are actually equal as sets. the

precise multiplicity is given by c3h = cr as the part 3h occurs in the cr not only as

cohomology class but even as divisor.

now e(d1) is besides contributions from point singularities (considered below) com-

puted as

e(d1)ord + cusp = c2(b3)d1  c1(b3)d2

1 + d3

1 + cusp

= 192 + 6248c2

1 + 4296c1t + 1632t2 + cusp

(7.45)

now f1g1 = cold = 3hr + c so 2ar(cold) = 2ar(3h) + e(c)  2(c3h) and

2ar(cold) = (960c2

1 + 498c1t + 240t2)

giving with 2ar(3h) = 3h(3h  c1) = 30c2

1 + 33c1t  9t2

e(c) = 882c2

1  567c1t  225t2

and

and altogether

cusp = 7cd1 + 6c1(b3)c  4e(c)

= 4020c2

1  2718c1t  1038t2

e(dord

42

(7.46)

(7.47)

(7.48)

(7.49)

let us now come to point singularities of the discriminant of equation 0 = h2p 2 +
1
4s12c13tz + o(z2) where

s = h3r  3h2u2p + 3hup 2 + 4p 3

(7.50)

where r = 2u3 + 8g0. now a similar inspection as for d5 shows that one has a
disjoint decomposition p  s = (p  h)  (p  r) and we will actually consider the loci

h  p = h  s and p  r = (p  s)\(h  p ) where the local forms of the singularities of

d1 are respectively (we neglect here some coecients)

(x3r  3u2x2y + 3uxy2 + 4y3)z + z2

py  rx  y2 + (x + y + y2 + y3)z + z2

(7.51)

so at # h  p = hp resp. # p  r = p r = p (s  3h) = 3p 2  3hp points one has

singularities which lead to corrections  resp.  to the euler number of the singular

surface d1.

so altogether one nds

e(d1) = e(dord

1 + cusp) + hp + (3p 2  3hp )

= 192 + 2228c2

1 + 1578c1t + 594t2 + (  3)hp + 3p 2

(7.52)

now for so(12) one has the matter/enhancement scheme: p   > 12   > d7 of
euler 9 = 8 + 1 and h   > 32   > e7 of euler 8 (as in the g = e7 case here
occurred a collision which is not eectively additive; cf. the six-dimensional discussion).

so now one has for the contributions from the ber enhancement

e(x) = 1(e(d1)  e(c)  e(h)  e(p ) + hp + #(c  r))

+2(e(c)  #(c  r))

+8(e(b2)  e(h)  e(p ) + hp )

+8(e(h)  hp  #(c  r)) + 9(e(p )  hp )

+l#(c  r) + mhp

= e(d1) + e(c) + 8e(b2)  e(h)

+(l  9)#(c  r) + (m  8)hp

= e(d1) + e(c) + 8e(b2)  e(h)

+(l + m  17)hp

(7.53)

43

giving altogether

e(x) = 288 + 1340c2

1 + 1008c1t + 370t2

+(l + m  17 +   3)hp + 3p 2

= 288 + 1260c2

1 + 1044c1t + 366t2

+(2 + (l + m  17 +   3))hp + (6 + 3)p 2

(7.54)

comparing this with the heterotic value

24n5 = 288 + 1260c2

1 + 1044c1t + 366t2

(7.55)

gives the prediction17  = 2 and l + m = 13  .

7.2.7 a1(i2) singularity

that they are actually equal as sets. the precise multiplicity is given by c3h = cr as

the part 3h occurs in the cr not only as cohomology class but even as divisor.

and altogether (up to the limitations mentioned above, i.e.

the codim 2 and codim

3 contributions from corrections along the higher double point curve h and at their

intersection ch)

e(d1) = 228 + 7469c2

1 + 3210c1t + 1878t2 + cusp

= 228 + 1631c2

1 + 2775c1t + 87t2

(7.77)

let us now come to the discussion of the codim 3 contributions. the discriminant

equation  for d is given by equ. (d.43) so that one has inside the r-plane the equation
h4p = 0 with p = 2h2g1  3f1qh  3hq2. now note that near h the equation of d1 is
given by (with e := f1h + q2)

 3hq2(h4  2h2hz + h 2z2) + (h 2(2g1h + 3f 2

1 ) +

9

e2)z3 + (f 3

1 + 3g1e)z4 + g2

1z5 = 0

so the complete square structure of the leading terms showed that we do not have a
generic tacnode structure, just as for i6 but in contrast to the case i4. with w := hz h2
the terms up to third order became (everything up to coecients) w2 + z3  h6 + 3h4w +
w2 + w3 near (h, w) = (0, 0) which goes with w := v  3
2h4 to the normal form h6 + v2.

49

(7.78)

now let us compare with the heterotic side where one has the spectral cover equation
a0 + a2x + a3y + a4x2 + a5xy = 0 with ai in the class 1  ic1 = (6  i)c1  t, so (up to
inessential factors)

hc1t = a5

h2c1t = a4

q3c1t = a3

f1 = f4c1t = a2

g1 = g6c1t = a0

(7.79)

further one nds coincidence18 of the heterotic expression p  a0a2
this matter curve with the f -theoretic p (up to inessential factors).

5  a2a3a5 + a2

3a4 for

the singularity structure, i.e. the overall higher tacnode structure along h, will change

if at special loci coecient functions vanish (say r at r  h = (h  q)  (h  h)) so that

one gets degenerations of the structure equ. (7.78). now the relevant loci are h  q and

h  h and one has

hp = h(2q + h)

hs = h(2q + 2h)

hr = h(2q + 3h)

(7.80)

both, h  r and h  p , lie in (and are actually equal to) h  (q  h). in the following we

will divide h  p and r  h into h  q and h  h.

this leads to the consideration of the following loci and singularities (up to coecients):

hx  qy  x4(x2 + xy + y2) + x2(x2 + xy + xy3 + y2)z

+(x3y + x2 + x2y2 + xy3 + xy + y2)z2 + z3

(7.81)

respectively

hx  hy  x4(x2 + x + y) + x2(x2 + x2y + xy + x + y2)z

+(x3 + x2 + x2y + x2y2 + xy + xy2 + y3)z2 + z3

(7.82)

so we expect further corrections (denoted below by  and ) to e(d1) at these hq resp.
hh points.

18the coincidence of weights for the p s and ai was already noticed in [7]; here we give the f -theoretic

p in h, h, q, f1, g1.

= e(d1)ord + cusp + hightac  e(h) + (2 +   8)hq + ( +   6)hh

=: e(d1)ord + cusp + h

(7.83)

where this time cr comprises two eects: rst, that the points of c which lie in r are
no longer cusp points, and secondly that, as the cusp curve c and the tacnode curve hr
intersect, the corrections cuspc and tach get a third term cusphightac = #(c  h) =
#(c  r) describing the inuence of the intersection locus. also at the loci h  q and
h  h we have the point singularities of d1 measured by  and , where we then have
to subtract their pointwise tacnode contribution  + 4, just as we did for the points of

c  r which were not cusp points where we subtracted their pointwise cusp contribution

 + 2.

now again we now that cr = 3hp as cohomology classes and c  r  h. one has

c  r 6 h  p , i.e. that c  r lies neither in h  q nor in h  h. then one has with the
disjoint decomposition h  p = (h  q)  (h  h) that19

#(c  r) = hp = 2hq + hh

#(h  p ) = #(h  q) + #(h  h) = hq + hh

(7.84)

now for su(5) one has the matter/enhancement schemes: p   > 5   > su(6)

of euler 6 = 5 + 1 and h   > 10   > so(10) of euler 7 = 5 + 1 + 1 so that we need
to add an e(h) in e(x 4). so one nds

e(x) = 1(e(d1)  e(c)  e(h)  e(p ) + #(c  r) + #(h  p ))

7.3 an observation on the 4d higgs chains

let us close with an observation relating the euler numbers in neighbouring cases in

certain higgs-chains.

7.3.1 6d case

for the chain e7  e6  d5  i5 with the euler numbers

e(e7) = 284  56n

e(e6) = 300  54n

e(d5) = 312  52n

e(i5) = 320  50n

53

(7.95)

one gets

e(higher)  2e(enh.locus) = e(lower)

(7.96)

where the enhancement locus is in this chain always the h locus of the higher group, i.e.

f1 = 4c1  t = 8  n, g1 = 3c1  t = 6  n, h = 2c1  t = 4  n and h = c1  t = 2  n
for e7, e6, d5 and i5 respectively.

the reason for these relations is of course easy to see. take for example the case of
e7 and e6. one has h1,1(e7)  h1,1(e6) = 1 and from h2,1 = nh  1 = dimm12+n(e8) +
dimm12n(hk) + h1,1(k3)  1 = 112 + 30n + k(12  n)  (k2  1) + 19 where hk = su(k)
is the commutant with k = 2 and 3 one gets that h2,1(e7)  h2,1(e6) = [k(12  n) 
(k2  1)]  [(k + 1)(12  n)  ((k + 1)2  1)] = (12  n) + 2k + 1 for k = 2 and so
e(e7)  e(e6) = 2(12  n  2k) = 2(2(6  k)  n) where 2(6  k)  n is just the degree
of the relevant enhancement curve.

similarly for the ik series one gets with

e(i6) = 288  54n

e(i5) = 320  50n

e(i4) = 352  44n

e(i3) = 384  36n

e(i2) = 420  24n

that again

e(higher)  2e(enh.locus) = e(lower)

(7.97)

(7.98)

where the relevant curve is in this chain always the p locus of the higher group, i.e.
8c1  (8  k)t = 16  (8  k)n for ik the higher group (note that in our set-up we made
the switch n  n).

7.3.2 4d case

for the chain e7  e6  d5  i5 with the euler numbers

e(e7) = 288 + 1350c2

1 + 1020c1t + 366t2

e(e6) = 288 + 1386c2

1 + 999c1t + 369t2

e(d5) = 288 + 1404c2

1 + 984c1t + 372t2

e(i5) = 288 + 1410c2

1 + 975c1t + 375t2

(7.99)

54

one gets

e(higher)  3e(enh.locus) = e(lower)

(7.100)

where the enhancement locus is in this chain always the h locus of the higher group, i.e.
f1 = 4c1  t, g1 = 3c1  t, h = 2c1  t and h = c1  t for e7, e6, d5 and i5 respectively.

again let us see from a heterotic point of view how this structure emerges. from

c2(su(n)) =

one sees that

c2(su(n + 1)) = c2(su(n))

[(n2 + n)c2

(7.102)

where the correction term is

[(n2 + n)c2

1 + (6c1  t)((5  2n)c1  t)] =

e(hnc1)

(7.103)

a 4d f -theory models

a.1 the geometry of the four-fold

we will consider calabi-yau fourfolds x which are elliptically bered  : x  b3 over
a complex three-dimensional base b3 = b, let  be a section. x can be described by a
weierstrass equation y2z = x3 + g2xz2 + g3z3 which embeds x in a p2 bundle w  b
which is the projectivization of a vector bundle p(l2l3ob) with l being a line bundle
over b. since the canonical bundle of x has to be trivial we get from kx = (kb + l)
the condition l = kb. further we can think of x, y and z as homogeneous coordinates
b , o(1)  k 3
on the p2 bers, i.e. they are sections of o(1)  k 2
b and o(1), whereas
g2 and g3 are sections of h 0(b, k 4
b ) and h 0(b, k 6
b ) respectively and the weierstrass
equation is a section of o(1)3  k 6
b . the section  can be thought of as the point
at innity x = z = 0, y = 1. the descriminant of the elliptic bration is given by
 = 4g3
b . if  = 0 at a point p  b the type of singular
ber is determined by the orders of vanishing ord(g2) = a, ord(g3) = b and ord() = c,
and given by kodairas classication of elliptic ber singularities:

let us denote by f = 4kb, g = 6kb and d = 12kb the classes of the divisors
associated to the vanishing of g2, g3 and  respectively.

we will assume b3 to be a p1 bundle  : b3  b2 which is the projectivization p(y )
of a vector bundle y = o  t , with t a line bundle over b2 and o(1) a line bundle
on the total space of p(y )  b2 which restricts on each p1 ber to the corresponding
line bundle over p1. further let u, v be homogeneous coordinates of the p1 bundle and
think of a and b as sections of o(1) and o(1)  t over b2.
if we set r = c1(o(1))
and t = c1(t ) and c1(o  t ) = r + t then the cohomology ring of b3 is generated
over the cohomology ring of b2 by the element r with the relation r(r + t) = 0, i.e.
the divisors u = 0 resp. v = 0, which are dual to r resp. r + t, do not intersect.

from adjunction c(b3) = (1 + c1(b2) + c2(b2))(1 + r)(1 + r + t) one nds for the chern
classes20 c1(b3) = c1 + 2r + t, c2(b3) = c2 + c1t + 2c1r. note that b2 will be chosen
to be rational. for this recall that the arithmetic genus pa of b3 has to be equal to one

dierentials on b3 which would pull back to x.

a.2 the four-ux

in order to obtain consistent f-theory compactications to four-dimensions on calabi-

yau fourfold x, it is necessary to turn on a number n3 of space-time lling three-branes
for tadpole cancellation [6]. this is related to the fact that compactications of the type

iia string on x are destabilized at one loop by r b  i8, where b is the ns-ns two-

20unspecied chern classes refer to b2.

57

form which couples to the string and i8 a linear combination of the pontryagin classes
p2 and p2
1 [5]. so, compactications of the type iia string to two-dimensions lead to

a tadpole term r b which is proportional to the euler characteristic of x. similar, in
m-theory compactications to three-dimensions on x arises a term r c  i8 with c

being the m-theory three-form, and integration over x then leads to the tadpole term

which is proportional to (x), and couples to the 2-brane [18],[19]. now, as m-theory

compactied to three-dimensions on x is related to a f-theory compactication on x

to four-dimensions [1], one is lead to expect a term r a with a now being the r-r four
form potential, which couples to the three-brane in f-theory [6]. taking into account the
proportionality constant [20], one nds (x)
24 = n3 three-branes in f-theory (or membranes
in m-theory resp. strings in type iia theory) [6].

furthermore the tadpole in m-theory will be corrected by a classical term c dc dc,

which appears if c gets a background value on x and thus leads to a contribution

r dc  dc to the tadpole [19]. also one has [21] a quantization law for the four-form eld

from the connection of f -theory to m-theory via s1 compactication one expects

some lifting of the four-ux of m-theory to play a role in f -theory. this is a (2, 2) form

in integral cohomology (essentially; its precise quantization law leading to half-integrality

is reviewed below) and so according to the hodge conjecture supported on an algebraic

surface s in x4. from the primitivity condition (again further reviewed below) for the

b.1 the spectral cover method for su (n) bundles

let us recall the idea of the spectral cover description of an su(n) bundle v : one

considers the bundle rst over an elliptic bre and then pastes together these descriptions

using global data in the base b. now over an elliptic bre e an su(n) bundle v over

z (assumed to be brewise semistable) decomposes as a direct sum of line bundles of

degree zero; this is described as a set of n points which sums to zero. if you now let this

vary over the base b this will give you a hypersurface c  z which is a ramied n-fold

cover of b. if one denotes the cohomology class in z of the base surface b (embedded
by the zero-section ) by   h 2(z) one nds that the globalization datum suitable to
encode the information about v is given by a class   h 1,1(b) with

c = n + 

(b.3)

as c is given as a locus w = a0 + a2x + a3y + . . . anx
2 = 0, for n even say and x, y the
usual elliptic weierstrass coordinates, with w a section of o()n  n with a line bundle
n of class . note that ai is of class   ic1.

n

the idea is then to trade in the su(n) bundle v over z, which is in a sense essentially

a datum over b, for a line bundle l over the n-fold (ramied) cover c of b: one has

v = p(p

cl  p)

(b.4)

with p : z b c  z and pc : z b c  c the projections and p the global version of
the poincare line bundle over e  e (actually one uses a symmetrized version of this),

i.e. the universal bundle which realizes the second e in the product as the moduli space

of degree zero line bundles over the rst factor.

a second parameter in the description of v is given by a half-integral number  which

occurs because one gets from the condition c1(v ) = (c1(l) + c1(c)c1
  ker  : h 1,1(c)  h 1,1(b) one has

b.2 ek bundles and del pezzo description

b.2.1 brewise

the del pezzo surface dpk (k = 0, ... 8) is given by blowing up k points in p2. so the lattice
l = h 2(dpk, z) has the signature (+1,k
1 ) in the basis given by the line h from p2 and
the exceptional divisors ei (i = 0, . . . 8); all of these classes are (1, 1). the anti-canonical

class, an elliptic curve, is ample and given by f for f = 3h pi ei. for k = 9 (and

the nine points lying on the intersection of two cubics) one gets the (almost del pezzo)

rational elliptic surface dp9, with f the elliptic bre class. exceptional or (1)
curves are the curves c with c2 = 1 and c  f = +1. the orthogonal complement of f
is the ek lattice. the ak1 lattice occurs too, with the basis ei  ei+1 (i = 1, . . . k  1);
the additional root, which leads to ek and does not lie on the line of the ak1 dynkin
diagram, is given by h  (e1 + e2 + e3). for dk1 take the representation of dpk as
hirzebruch surface f1 blown up in k 1 points lying on dierent bers, denote the two p 1
in each of the k 1 special bers of type a2 by li (i = 1, . . . k 1) of classes li and by f
the bre class (f = li +li); f  is the sublattice generated by the li (i = 1, . . . k 1) and
(f + k) is generated by the root system r = {(li  lj)}, i, j = 1, . . . k  1, i 6= j
of type dk1.

now, as every point w in the weight lattice l/f z of g determines a representation

w of the maximal torus and, from taking a at connection a in the representation w,

a line bundle lw on e - thus providing a homomorphism to jac(e) = e, a semistable

g = ek bundle over an elliptic curve e corresponds to a homomorphism from l to e
mapping f to zero. this rst dictionary is further translated via the torelli theorem to
essentially23 the space of complex structures of a dpk surface keeping a divisor d of class
f xed: namely, keeping d xed, y  f = 0 for y  lf means that ly|d is of degree
[51]) the association, in the
zero, so denes a point in jac(e). one may rephrase (cf.

case of e8 say, saying that the at gauge eld on the elliptic curve d is mapped to the set
of eight points on d which represent the intersection of d with divisors generating the

e8 piece in the lattice of the del pezzo surface. one gets the del pezzo surface writing
a second cubic (besides the elliptic curve d) on p2 and forcing nine points to lie on

their intersection, where the nine points are got in at coordinates on d from the at

e8 gauge eld represented as ~w = (w1, . . . , w8) in a cartan basis by wi = zi  z0 with
z0 + z1 + . . . + z8 = 0.

23for a subtlety involving a certain (9  k)th root of lf |f cf. [7]

60

b.2.2 globally

the root system is describing (cf.
for example [43],[45],[47], [48]) a certain part of the
h 1,1(dp, z) so that the variation of the bre of the spectral cover over b describes the

variation of certain (-1) curves l in their variation in a family of surfaces over b (expressing

the eective replacement of these lines by points, causing the (1,1)-shift). this leads also
to the necessary relation between g2

2 (for i = 1, 2).

i and l2i

2 = i

actually we will see the spectral cover as parametrization of exceptional lines in a

surface bration over b. this occurs by taking into account the description of the

enlarged root system in surface cohomology. note that as the same moduli space wg
parametrizes g bundles over an elliptic curve e and del pezzo surfaces dpg (with e of
class k xed) one gets by adiabatic extension over the base b that to the bundle v
over z corresponds a bration w het
g  b of dpg surfaces via pulling back the universal
object (now the universal surface not the universal bundle) along the section s : b 
wg = mz/b.

so for g = e8 both data, the spectral cover and the del pezzo bration are equivalent.
the obvious analogue works for type en: the character lattice  of en is still isomorphic
to the primitive cohomology group h 2
0 (dpn, z). for type an or dn we use the fact
that the corresponding character lattices can be embedded into the en lattice as the
orthogonal complement of an appropriate fundamental weight (corresponding to one of

the ends of the dynkin diagram). so one can dene a del pezzo bration of type an
or dn to be a del pezzo bration  : u  b of type en together with a section of the
family of en lattices r2z which, in each ber, is in the w orbit of that fundamental
weight. for an, for example, this additional data consists, in each ber, of specifying the
pullback of a line of the original p 2.

b.2.3 why spectral covers for su(n) bundles and del pezzo brations for ek

bundles

when one tries to transfer these results to the (d- and especially to the) e-series, one

faces the following problem. for the e-series one does not describe [7] the bundles via

the spectral cover construction but instead via the associated del pezzo bration, giving
not a covering of b but24 a bration over it by surfaces. this is related to the following

24this admits also a representation-theoretic explanation. the weyl group of an admits a small
permutation representation n + 1 which decomposes into the sum of two irreducible representations:
the trivial one and the weights, z[w/w0] = 1  . but every permutation representation of wen
contains at least three irreducible constituents, so the cohomology of an associated spectral cover contains

61

(cf.
[40]): consider the type iia string on an elliptic k3 with ade singularity times
t 2; the n = 1 content of this 4d n = 4 theory includes three adjoint chiral elds x,

y , z, whose cartan vevs, parametrizing the higgs branch, correspond to blowing up

respectively deforming the singularity respectively giving wilson lines to the ade gauge
group on t 2; the r-symmetry induces an equivalence of the corresponding moduli spaces.
this gives the main theorem on the structure of the moduli space mg of at g-bundles
on an elliptic curve.

concretely let us take as elliptic curve e = p1,2,3[6] of equation e := z6+x3+y2+zxy =
0 leading (with w of sect. b.1) to the deformation e + vw of the su(n) singularity
showing at the same time looijengas moduli space (a0, a2, a3, . . . , an)  pn1 of at
su(n) bundles over e as well as the 0d spectral geometry consisting of n points (e = 0)

(w = 0) on e. note that in this case of the an group it is possible to eectively replace
25 a 2d geometry of p1s by the zero dimensional representatives as v occurs only linear

and so in the process of period integral evaluation to describe the variation of hodge

structure relevant here can be integrated out.

there one nds instead for the deformation e +p6

by contrast the same decoupling phenomenon does not take place26 for the the ek case:
i=1 aiviz6i + b2v2x2 + b3v3y + b4v4x of
zero locus dp8 = p1,1,2,3[6] showing the 2d spectral geometry of the del pezzo surface
with h 1,1(dp, z)e = e8 and moduli space p1,2,3,4,5,6,2,3,4.

b.3 the parabolic approach and the characteristic classes of

e8, e7, e6

in order to get a heterotic prediction for the euler characteristic of x with a section

of i2, i3 singularities, we have to compute the second chern class of the corresponding
e7, e6 bundles on the heterotic side. also our second bundle will always be an e8
bundle.

in order to do so we can use the parabolic bundles description which leads one to easily

compute their chern classes [7],[52]. in this approach one starts with an unstable bundle

additional pieces. to get an object with the right cohomology one must either go up in dimension or

restrict attention to classes which transform correctly under some correspondences.

25for the general phenomenon relating even (0d to 2d, of symmetric intersection form) resp. odd
[41]; the same relation underlies the

(1d to 3d, of antisymmetric intersection form) cohomology cf.

extraction [42] of the 1d seiberg-witten curve from the 3d periods of a calabi-yau and the relation

between k3 singularities and ade gauge groups.

26correspondingly there occurs a situation involving e groups, where the coulomb branch of an n = 2

system does not reduce to a riemann surface but is described in terms of 3-form periods [40].

on a single elliptic curve e. for this one xes a point p on e with the associated rank
1 line bundle o(p) = w1. rank k line bundles wk are then inductively constructed via
the unique non-split extension 0  o  wk+1  wk  0. if one writes the dual of wk
as w 
k then the unique (up to translations on e) minimal unstable bundle with trivial
determinant on e is given by v = wk  w 
nk. this can be deformed by an element
of h 1(e, w 
nk) to a stable bundle v  which ts then into the exact sequence
nk  v   wk  0. to get a global version of this construction on replaces the
0  w 
wk by their global versions, i.e. replace o(p) by o(1). the global versions of wk are
inductively constructed by an exact sequence 0  ln1  wk  wk1  0.

b.3.1 e8 bundle

the starting point for building an e8 bundle is g = su(6)  su(3)  su(2) and let
x6,3,2 denote the three factors. then locally one has a description of the xs given by
x6 = (w5  o)  o(p)1/6 and x3 = (w3  o(p)1/3) and x2 = w2  l. the global
versions are given by [7]

x6 = (w5  s1  s5  l1)  o()1/6  l3/2

x3 = w3  o()1/3  l1

x2 = w2  o()1/2  l1/2

the fundamental class (v )27 of this bundle is given by

(v ) =   152 + 135c1  310c2

with  = 4c1 + c1(s) and which then leads to the following expression for the (x)

1 + 1080c1t + 360t2

(b.9)

b.3.2 e7 bundle

our starting point for e7 bundle is g = su(4)  su(4)  su(2) and let x1,2,3 denote
again the three factors. then locally one has a description of the xs given by x1 =
(w3  o)  o(p)1/4 and x2 = (w4  o(p)1/4) and x3 = w2  o(p)1/2. as global
versions we choose

x1 = (w3  s1  s3  l1)  o()1/4  l1/2

27which is c2(v )/60 for e8 bundle, also note that (v ) = c2(v )/36 and (v ) = c2(v )/24 for e7 resp.

(b.10)

(b.11)

with  = 7/2c1 + c1(s) and which then leads to the following expression for the (x)

24n5 = 288 + 1866c2

1 + 504c1t + 504t2

(b.12)

b.3.3 e6 bundle

in order to get a e6 bundle one chooses as the unstable bundle whose structure group
reduces to a group locally g = su(3)  su(3)  su(3) following [7]. the fundamental

characteristic class of an e6 bundle whose structure group reduces to g is

(v ) = c2(x1) + c2(x2) + c2(x3)

(b.13)

now, it was shown in [7] that on a single elliptic curve x1 and x2 are given by x1,2 =
w3  o(p)1/3 and for x3 one has x3 = (w2  o)  o(p)1/3. all we have to do now is
to give a global description of these bundles and compute their chern classes. therefore

we want to consider bundles which are isomorphic to the xis on each ber and have
trivial determinant. thus we can take for x1,2

x1,2 = w3  o()1/3  l1

(b.14)

and for x3 the most general possibility to write down a global version of it is

x3 = (w2  s1  s2  l1)  o()1/3

(b.15)

where s is an arbitrary line bundle on b which is introduced using the fact that one can

twist by additional data coming from the base. from this we can now compute chern

classes. we nd for the fundamental characteristic class of the e6 bundle

(v ) =   32 + 21c1  39c2

(b.16)

where  = c1(s) + 3c1(l) and with the anomaly formula we derive simply the heterotic
expectation for the euler characteristic of x with i3 singularity which is

24n5 = 288 + 1704c2

1 + 720c1t + 432t2

(b.17)

c comparison of the moduli spaces

in view of the application indicated in the title of the paper the most important insight

of an association of data between the heterotic and the f -theory side to be expected will
be the following: the gamma class  is an element of h 1,1(c) where the spectral cover c

is an n-fold ramied cover of b; think, in a naive picture, of this as a curve in c or as

a curve (null-cohomologous) in b each of whose points is covered by some preimages in

c; now, if one switches from the spectral cover representation of the bundle (where over

each base point b  b sits a nite point set) to the representation by a bration over b

of del pezzo surfaces (of type ade in general or of type e in the more widely known

case), the points on the elliptic bre over b are traded in for (1, 1) cohomology classes

on the del pezzo surface (sitting now over b) which correspond to divisors intersecting

the former elliptic curve (which re-occurs here as anti-canonical divisor) in the formerly

given points; then the situation is considered to be embedded in an e8 del pezzo surface
with the new (formerly missing) classes/divisors shrunken to zero; this is embedded in

a dp9 set-up which re-occurs (with a structure representing precisely the corresponding
heterotic bundle) in the stable degeneration of the calabi-yau four-fold on the dual f -
theory side; as the points were thickened to p 1s the (1, 1) class becomes a (2, 2) class

which is the candidate for the four-ux class.

c.1 general comparison of moduli space and spectra

the moduli in a 4d n=1 heterotic compactication on an elliptic cy, as well as in the

dual f-theoretic compactication, break into base parameters which are even (under

the natural involution of the elliptic curves), and ber or twisting parameters; the

latter include a continuous part which is odd, as well as a discrete part. in [22] all the

heterotic moduli were interpreted in terms of cohomology groups of the spectral covers,

and identied with the corresponding f-theoretic moduli in a certain stable degeneration.

for this one uses the close connection of the spectral cover and the ade del pezzo bra-

tions. for the continuous part of the twisting moduli, this amounts to an isomorphism

between certain abelian varieties: the connected component of the heterotic prym variety

(a modied jacobian) and the f-theoretic intermediate jacobian. the comparison of the

discrete part generalizes the matching of heterotic 5-branes/f -theoretic 3-branes.

by working with elliptically bered z one can adiabatically extend the known results
about moduli spaces of g-bundles over an elliptic curve e = t 2, of course taking into

account that such a berwise description of the isomorphism class of a bundle leaves

65

denitely room for twisting along the base b. the latter possibility actually involves a

two-fold complication: there is a continuous as well as a discrete part of these data. it is

quite easy to see this for g = su(n): in this case v can be constructed via push-forward
of the poincare bundle on the spectral cover c b z, possibly twisted by a line bundle n
over the spectral surface c (an n-fold cover of b (via ) lying in z), whose rst chern
class (projected to b) is known from the condition c1(v ) = 0. so n itself is known
up to the following two remaining degrees of freedom: rst a class in h 1,1(c) which

projects to zero in b (the discrete part), and second an element of jac(c) := p ic0(c)
(the continuous part; the moduli odd under the elliptic involution).

the continuous part is expected [7] to correspond on the f -theory side to the odd
moduli, related there to the intermediate jacobian j 3(x 4) of dimension h2,1, so that
the following picture emerges. the moduli space m of the bundles is bered m  y,

with bre jac(c). there is a corresponding picture on the f -theory side: ignoring the

kahler classes (on both sides), the moduli space there is again bered. the base is

the moduli space of those complex deformations which x a certain complex structure
of z; the bre is the intermediate jacobian j 3(x 4) = h 3(x, r)/h 3(x, z) in total28,
h2,1(z) + h1(z, adv ) + 1 = h3,1 + h2,1.

one expects a general scheme of a duality dictionary beyond the previously considered
cases of relating h2,0(c) and h3,1(x 4) respectively elements of h 1,0(c) and h 2,1(x 4) (cf.

[24], [7], section 1 and the introduction). together with the proposed identication of

the discrete moduli one gets a dictionary of elements related by a (1, 1) hodge shift

where in the rst line the deformations of x 4 preserving the given type of singularity

(corresponding with the unbroken gauge group; actually we will consider the parts in

the wi) are understood, in the second line a part of the relative jacobian (see below) is
understood, and in the last line the subspaces ker  respectively ker (j  ).

one can also give [22] an interpretation of all the bundle moduli h 1(z, adv ), even or

odd under the involution, in terms of even respectively odd cohomology of the spectral

surface , including an interpretation of the z2 equivariant index of [7] as giving essentially
the holomorphic euler characteristic of the spectral surface.

28unspecied hodge numbers refer to x 4

66

now let us recall that the z2 equivariant index i = ne  no of [7], counting the bundle
moduli which are even respectively odd under the  -involution, can be interpreted as

giving essentially the holomorphic euler characteristic of the spectral surface [22] which

is

1 + h2,0(c)  h1,0(c) =

|c =

c2(z)c + 2c 3

12

c2
1 +

n
2

(  nc1) + c1

(c.18)

now one identies the number of local complex deformations h2,0(c) of c with ne re-
spectively the dimension h1,0(c) of jac(c) := p ic0(c) with no.

in this way one gets from a spectrum comparison the following relations [11], [39] in a

pure gauge case (the case referred to as seperation resp. codimension one (what concerns

the discriminant) case in the main body of the paper)

h1,1 = h1,1(z) + 1 + r

h2,1 = no

h3,1 = h2,1(z) + i + no + 1

(c.19)

now one has to realize explicitely the map providing the (1, 1) shift in hodge classes.
in the end this goes of course back to the additional p1 one has in f -theory over the

heterotic side, as visible already in eight dimensions. more precisely we will reinterpret

the spectral cover of b which describes the heterotic su(n) bundle in terms of a bration

of del pezzo surfaces over b, where what were n points of c lying over b  b are then
exceptional curves29 in the del pezzo surface over b.

note that the the eective replacing of the p1 classes by points accounts for the missing

dimensions causing the mentioned (1,1) shift in cohomology when comparing the dual

results. the description in the ek case is already well adapted to the f-theory picture
of having a bration w  b (for each bundle) of del pezzo surfaces over b.

c.2 brane-impurities

from the relations (c.19) one nds that n3 = n5 as follows [11]. first one expresses,
from the heterotic identication, the hodge numbers of x 4 purely in data of the common

29i.e. rational curves l of self-intersection 1 which have intersection +1 with the ample anti-canonical

class; for the (almost del pezzo) case of dp9 these are just sections of the elliptic bration

c.3 stable degeneration and the map from the heterotic theory

to f -theory

we consider the stable degeneration [7],[37], [38] x 4  x 4

deg = w1 z w2 where the wi
are bered by del pezzo surfaces over b. the 8d picture involves a k3 degenerating

into the union of two rational elliptic surfaces (dp9, almost del pezzo). the base of
the bration is the union of two projective lines intersecting in a point q over which a

common elliptic curve e is bered; roughly speaking the two e8 contributions in the k3
are separated. recall that the chosen k3 had picard number two with section and ber

as the two algebraic cycles (still allowing 18 deformations which match the heterotic side)
and the transcendental lattice e8  e8  h, with h the 2-dimensional hyperbolic plane,
which leads to the 18-dimensional space s := so(2, 18)/so(2)  so(18) divided by

the appropriate discrete group; one specializes then to two e8 singularities at positions
z = 0,  in the p 1 base, which after the separation in two surfaces are again re-
smoothed; imagine to take (for the dp9s to arise) the two f4, g6 parts at z = 0,  of the
original weierstrass data f8, g12 of the k3.

68

this corresponds on the heterotic side to the large area degeneration of a t 2 of the

same complex structure parameter as e [7], [37]. imagine that the h and its counterpart

in s above correspond to the degrees of freedom represented by the complex structure

modulus  and the area (+ b-eld) modulus  of e; then in the   i limit one nds

in the corresponding boundary component of the quotient (discrete\s) the two spaces
(we8\(ei  c)), glued together by  (e1) =  (e2), describing the moduli of the two
dp9s (c the coroot lattice of e8). the heterotic invariant n5 = c2z  c2v1  c2v2 is
then mirrored on the f-theory side by n3 =  (z)

.

24 + (w1)

24 + (w2)

24

note that the (even) deformations of vi correspond to those deformations of wi which
preserve berwise the elliptic curve e common with the heterotic side, so preserving in

total the calabi-yau z common to the wi: their number is given by the dimension of
h 1(wi, twi o(z)) = h 3,1(wi). these are the deformations in the stable degeneration
of x 4 which are relevant to the respective bundle. further under the stable degeneration
j 3(x) splits o the abelian varieties j 3(wi), which contain the pieces relevant for the
comparison. so essentially this construction interprets those elements of h 2,2
prim(x 4, z)
that are captured by the corresponding parts in the wi cohomology30. concerning com-
plex structure deformations note that the distribution into deformations of z respectively
those deformations h 1(wi, twi  o(z)) = h 3,1(wi) of wi, which preserve z, reects
the well known distribution of the deforming monomials of the dening f -theory equation
for x 4 into middle-polynomials and the rest.

in the representation of the bundle via the del pezzo construction respectively in the

stable degeneration on the f -theory side the data are already in a form appropriate

for comparison. for example in the case of e8 bundles one has just to blow down the
section of the dp9 bre on the f -theory side to get the dp8 bre of the heterotic side
showing the relation of the cohomologies and the intermediate jacobians (cf. [22]). for
a bundle of group h 6= e8 the section  : b  x 4 of g-singularities in the f -theory
setup corresponds (assuming g to be simply-laced) to having a bundle of unbroken gauge

group g, i.e. an h bundle where h is the commutant of g in e8, over the heterotic
calabi-yau z respectively having31 a section s : b  wh = mz/b or, as the bre of
wh over b  b parametrizes the corresponding del pezzo surfaces, a bundle w het
h  b
of del pezzo surfaces dph bered over b. so, if32 one considers heterotically actually a
30for the relation of the primitiveness condition to the w, z geometry cf. the discussion in the section

on the four-ux

31at least locally over the dense open subset of b where bres correspond to semistable bundles
32this can be done as we have an ade system of rational (-2) curves lying in h 1,1(k3, z) as well as in
h 1,1(dp8, z)f (in the case of the e-series, say; f the elliptic curve representing the ample anticanonical
divisor); note that the complex structures for dph are given by homomorphisms h 1,1(dph , z)f  f

69

dp8 bration with g singularity instead of the dph bration, then locally at , i.e. at
the singularity along b (local in the dp bre and global along b), the picture in the k3
bre of x 4  b respectively the dp bre on the heterotic side is the same.

c.4 comparison of the discrete data

of course the ultimate goal will be to make the complex two-cycle supporting the four-

ux explicit and check the choice with a dual heterotic situation. note that, comparing
the heterotic contribution of 2 in eq. (1.5)

with the formula [23]

n5, = n5,=0 +

1
2

(2)

n3 =

g2 ,

we are led to expect an association letting i correspond with gi giving

i
(2

i ) = g2
i .

(c.25)

(c.26)

(c.27)

note that two other facts t with this association of  and g. first the shifted

integrality (to half-integrality): the analogy in the data concerned with the discrete part

of the twisting degrees of freedom (cf. below) is represented in the following juxtaposition:

on the heterotic side one has (cf. sect. (b.1))

 =

c1(c)  c1(b)

2

+ c1(l),

(c.28)

1

c 
2 does not necessarily exist as a line bundle. similarly one has on the f-theory side

where the last term is an element of integral cohomology whereas the square root (k 1
kb)
[21]

g =

c2
2

+ 

(c.29)

where   h 4(x, z), but c2 is not necessarily even. strictly speaking one should consider
here the individual gi (i = 1, 2) corresponding to the i by means of the association
provided by the stable degeneration (cf. the introduction to this section).

secondly the restriction to the subspace ker  respectively primitiveness: the g ad-

missible in an n = 1 supersymmetric compactication are in ker(j  ) [19]. the last

and the complex structures for dp8 keeping the g singularity are similarly given by the corresponding
homomorphisms for dp8 mapping the g system of rational (-2) curves to zero (i.e.
they essentially
describe a mapping for the h-part)

70

condition comes down for the relevant projected classes in h 2,2(w ) to the following: on

the heterotic side the actual spectral cover construction will in the e8 case involve the
corresponding bration of dp8 surfaces over b (the section of dp9 blown down); now,
the embeddings of the 8d heterotic elliptic curves in the 8d del pezzos patch together
to an embedding of z in the wi, giving a map h p,q(w )  h p,q(z); but for the dp8 the
anti-canonical class given by the elliptic curve e is ample, so actually the ker (j  ) con-
dition leads to a ker  |z : (h 2,2(w )  h 2,2(z)) condition, respectively, if one combines
with the integration over the bre, in a ker(h 2,2(w )  h 2,2(z)  h 1,1(b)) condition;
one has then to divide out the class dual to sb, the del pezzo bre of pr : w  b,
corresponding to a dierential form supported on the base, which is mapped to zero in

the integration over the  : z  b bre. so nally the space we are concerned with is
the (ker : w  b)/sbz part in h 2,2(w ). so the primitiveness condition is the analogue
of the condition ker  : h 1,1(c, z)  h 1,1(b, z) on .

this ts in and actually completes the general scheme of a duality dictionary beyond
the previously considered cases of relating h2,0(c) and h3,1(x 4) respectively elements of
h 1,0(c) and h 2,1(x 4) (cf. [24], [7] and the appendix).

now one has to realize explicitely the map providing the (1, 1) shift in hodge classes.
a naive33 way to obtain the association of i with gi is via the cylinder map [49],[50].
this replaces each point in c lying over b  b by a complex projective line l lying above
in the del pezzo surface over b. indeed, l2 = 1, suggesting the desired relation (c.27).

d 6d computations

we list some spectrum and euler number computations in 6d for the in series.

d.1 heterotic spectra

the euler numbers (cf.

[4]) match with the heterotic expectations for the spectrum

(note that the spectra have to full the gravitational anomaly condition 244 + nv = nh
(here occur the fundamental matter and the antisymmetric tensors) and that always

33more precisely the right hand side of (c.27) gets contributions also from distinct lines which intersect
in the del pezzo surface. h i(c) breaks into several isotypic pieces (ve of them, for e8). the values of
 coming from bundles all live in one of these pieces, where the cylinder map changes the intersection
numbers by a factor of 60 (for e8); so the correct association sends  to 1

60 times its cylinder.
