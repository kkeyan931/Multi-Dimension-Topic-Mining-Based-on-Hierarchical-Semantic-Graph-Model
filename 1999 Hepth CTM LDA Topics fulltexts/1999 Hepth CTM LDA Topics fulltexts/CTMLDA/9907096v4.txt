abstract

we consider the parity-invariant dirac operator with a mass term in three-dimensional qcd for
nc = 2 and quarks in the fundamental representation. we show that there exists a basis in which
the matrix elements of the euclidean dirac operator are real. assuming there is spontaneous
breaking of avor and/or parity, we read o from the fermionic action the avor symmetry-
breaking pattern sp(4nf )  sp(2nf )  sp(2nf ) that might occur in such a theory. we then
construct a random matrix theory with the same global symmetries as two-color qcd3 with
fundamental fermions and derive from here the nite-volume partition function for the latter in the
static limit. the expected symmetry breaking pattern is conrmed by the explicit calculation in
random matrix theory. we also derive the rst leutwyler-smilga-like sum rule for the eigenvalues
of the dirac operator.

introduction

it has been known for several years that the eigenvalues of the dirac operator, d, derived
from qcd in a nite volume, are constrained by sum rules [1] . these sum rules originally
derived by leutwyler and smilga, can also be obtained from a random matrix theory with the
same global symmetries as qcd. this was originally demonstrated by verbaarschot and shuryak
[2] for qcd in four dimensions with quarks in the fundamental representation and color group
su (3). subsequently it has also been demonstrated for su (2) with fundamental fermions and
for adjoint fermions (nc  2) [3].
the random matrix ensembles corresponding to these various types of theory reect the respective
structures of the matrix elements of the dirac operator in the three cases and are labelled by a
parameter . for the case of nc = 2 (where nc denotes the number of colors) and fundamental
fermions, there exists a basis in which the matrix elements of d are real. the corresponding
matrix ensemble has orthogonal symmetry and is labelled  = 1. for nc  3 and fundamental
fermions, and for arbitrary nc and adjoint fermions, the corresponding matrix ensembles have
unitary and symplectic symmetry, respectively, and are labelled by  = 2, 4.

the sum rules can be expressed using the so-called microscopic spectral density, denoted s(),
of the distribution of eigenvalues of the random matrix model.
it is obtained by magnifying
the spectral density in the vicinity of the origin ( = 0) on the scale of the average eigenvalue
spacing, which for interacting quarks and a non-vanishing spectral density at the origin is given
by n 1 (n here is the size of the random matrices). this microscopic limit is to be contrasted
with the large n limit, in which the eigenvalue density smoothes out to some distribution whose
macroscopic shape depends on the matrix potential.

originally, it was conjectured on the basis of the work in [2, 5, 6] that s() is a universal quantity
that depends only on symmetry. the sum rules were determined for a number of cases and further
evidence for the proposed scenario was compiled [4, 7]. it was also demonstrated, by incorporating
a schematic temperature dependence corresponding to the lowest matsubara frequency into the
matrix model, that s is independent of temperature up to the critical temperature of the model
[8, 9]. a discussion of universality in the presence of a nonzero chemical potential was given in [11].
the universality was also demonstrated numerically in a number of papers. more recently, it was
shown that s() does not depend on the matrix potential chosen for the rmt [10]. this comes
about because the dierential equation determining the orthogonal polynomials corresponding to
the matrix model is independent of the choice of (polynomial) potential in the microscopic limit.
the orthogonal polynomials in turn completely determine s() and higher order correlators
s(1, ...n) in the microscopic limit.

the reason for this universality is that both qcd and the corresponding random matrix theory
(rmt) can be mapped onto the same low-energy, eective partition function. this was rst

1

noticed in [2] and further elaborated in [3, 4, 5, 12]. this partition function expresses the quark
mass dependence in the static limit and in a nite volume. the range of volumes considered is
the so-called mesoscopic range. we can think of this as a box of size l such that l  1
qcd,
where qcd is the qcd scale paramenter, so that only the low-lying excitations (goldstone
modes) contribute to the partition function, but l  c
 is the compton wavelength
of the goldstone modes), so that we are dealing with the static limit of this partition function
(no kinetic terms).

 (where c

in fact, this eective partition function is a function of one scaling variable mv , where m is
a mass matrix, v the space-time volume and  the chiral condensate (assumed to be non-zero).
in the rmt the space-time volume corresponds to the size n of the random matrices. the
banks-casher relation [13]

 =

(0)

v

(1.1)

relates the density of eigenvalues of the dirac operator at the origin, (0), to this condensate in
the thermodynamic and chiral limits (taken in this order). the spacing between eigenvalues is
thus  v 1, as opposed to  v 1/4 for free quarks in 4d.
the relationship between random matrix theory and nite-volume partition functions has been
claried further by damgaard, and by akemann and damgaard in a series of papers [14].

in this paper we will consider qcd in three euclidean dimensions and we will take nc, the number
of quark colors, equal to 2. the quarks are in the fundamental representation. we will show that
also in 3 dimensions, there exists a basis in which the dirac operator for nc = 2 has real matrix
elements. in the spirit of the universality conjecture, we will construct a random matrix theory
with the same global symmetries as the dirac operator. the average of the fermion determinant
over the gluon eld congurations is in this approach replaced by a gaussian average over an
ensemble of random hermitian matrices. from this average we will obtain, using a supersymmetric
formalism and through the same kind of steps as in [2, 3], and in [8] for qcd in four space-time
dimensions, the form of the low-energy qcd partition function. assuming that spontaneous
breaking of global avor symmetry may occur in such a theory, we will obtain the pattern of such
a symmetry breaking.

except for being of purely theoretical interest, three-dimensional qcd may be relevant for study-
ing the behavior of qcd near the deconning phase transition and for lattice computations. in
euclidean eld theory, at nite temperature the integral over the 4-momentum component k4 is
replaced by a sum over matsubara frequencies and one is left with an eective 3-dimensional eld
theory. on the lattice, it is faster to simulate two colors than three. therefore the sum rules
derivable from nc = 2 may be easily checked numerically.

2

in the next section a basis is constructed in which the dirac operator for su (2)-color is real. in
section 3 the symmetry breaking pattern is discussed. in section 4 and 5, random matrix theory
is used as a starting point for deriving the low-energy partition function and the avor symmetry
breaking pattern. in section 6 the corresponding sum rules are derived.

2 the dirac operator in 3d

in three dimensional minkowski space the qcd lagrangian is given by

l = 

1
4

trf 2 +

nf

xf =1

f (i6d  mf )f

(2.2)

a
where f is the gauge eld tensor, 6d  d, d =  + iaa
2 is the covariant derivative
for su (2) and mf is the quark mass corresponding to avor f . f are quark spinors in the
fundamental representation and f is the avor index (the indices corresponding to color and spin
are suppressed). the lowest-dimensional (fundamental) representation of  is given by the pauli
matrices 0 = 3, 1 = i1, 2 = i2. in this 2d representation, there is no chiral symmetry,
since there is no 2  2 matrix that anticommutes with the k.
for all the mf = 0, the above lagrangian is invariant under parity p , but the mass term breaks
this p invariance. the parity transformation in 3d is dened by



(t, x1, x2)  1(t,x1, x2)
a0(t, x1, x2)  a0(t,x1, x2)
a1(t, x1, x2)  a1(t,x1, x2)
a2(t, x1, x2)  a2(t,x1, x2)

(2.3)

we can dene a parity-invariant lagrangian with a non-zero mass term if we take instead of the
k a 4-dimensional representation of the 

0 =   3

0 3 ! ,

1 =   i1

0 i1 ! ,

0 i2 !

(2.4)

and moreover introduce a 4  4 mass matrix corresponding to avor f :

mf = mf   1

0

0 1 !

(2.5)

the dirac operator is then sandwiched between 4spinors (f f ). in terms of 2spinors, this
representation corresponds to nf 2spinors f with mass +mf , and nf 2spinors f with mass
mf . under p the mass terms for the 2spinors change sign, so that if the two sets of two-
spinors transform into each other in a z2 transformation f  f , the total lagrangian is
invariant under the combined transformations p and z2 [15]. we can use this fact to write down
a (p, z2)-invariant lagrangian in the fundamental representation with an appropriate choice of
mass term:

l = 

1

trf 2 +

2nf

xf =1

f i6df 

nf

xf =1

m f f +

m f f

2nf

xf =nf +1

(2.6)

(we could also have some components with zero mass, but in the following we will not consider
this possibility.)

we now proceed to discuss qcd in three-dimensional euclidean space. the part of the lorentz-
f (6d + mf )f where  denotes the
invariant lagrangian involving fermion elds is given by pf
hermitean conjugate, the masses are chosen in pairs of opposite sign like in (2.6), and from now
on 6d denotes d with the euclidean gamma matrices 0 = 3, 1 = 1, 2 = 2 satisfying
{, } = 2 .
in four dimensions, we can nd a basis such that the euclidean dirac operator i6d has real matrix
elements. the reason is that this operator possesses (for nc = 2) an anti-unitary symmetry [3]
expressed by

[i6d, c2k] = 0

(2.7)

here c is the (minkowski space) charge conjugation operator, 2 is a pauli matrix in color space
and k denotes complex conjugation. it is easy to show that in 3d, an identical relation (2.7)
c 1 = 
holds for the fundamental representation. for (2.7) to hold, c should satisfy c
(where  are the pauli matrices, 0 = 3, 1 = 1, 2 = 2) which is precisely the condition for
the charge conjugation matrix in minkowski space. by explicit calculation we nd

4

c = i2

(2.8)

where c is the 22 charge conjugation matrix satisfying c = c t = c  = c 1, c 2 = 1. as
we will now show, the anti-unitary symmetry operator c2k denes a basis in which the matrix
elements of i6d are real. this basis is simply dened by

c2kk = k

(2.9)

since (c2k)2 = 1, such a denition makes sense.
(by contrast, in trying to dene adjoint
fermions in euclidean space, the square of the corresponding anti-unitary operator is 1. the
majorana condition then makes sense only if one introduces conjugation of the second kind
 = .) from the anti-unitary condition it follows

2c i6d c2 = (i6d)

(2.10)

 i6d l
by using (2.9), (2.10) and the properties of c it immediately follows that the quantity k
is real, where k denotes the basis vectors in (2.9). therefore, the matrix elements hk|i 6d|li
are real in this basis. the fact that the dirac operator can be real was also used in [16].

3 discussion of the avor symmetry breaking pattern

before doing the calculation in random matrix theory, we will now discuss the symmetry breaking
pattern we expect to obtain. this can be read o [17] from the form of the fermionic action

sf = z d3x

2nf

xf =1

f (6d + mf )f

(3.11)

where the - matrices are 0 = 3, 1 = 1, 2 = 2 and d is the covariant derivative for
the su (2) color group. now it is easy to verify that dt
 = 22 and
therefore, keeping in mind that the f are anticommuting,

 = 2d2 and t

f 6df = 22f 6d 22 f

(3.12)

5

where the  s are in color space and the s in dirac space. we can then rewrite the fermionic
action as

sf = z d3x
= z d3x

this expression is invariant under sp(4nf ) transformations in avor space [21]. this is similar
to nf avors with color symmetry group su (2) in four dimensions, where the avor symmetry
group for zero mass gets enlarged to u (2nf ) [17]. the vacuum state will break this symmetry.
assuming the complete axial group is broken (maximal breaking of chiral symmetry), only the
symmetry subgroup of sp(4nf ) that leaves  invariant will be unbroken. the chiral condensate
for each avor f has the same sign as the mass mf . rewriting the mass term in the form

2nf

xf =1

mf f f =

1
2

2nf

xf =1  f

f !  0 mf

f !
0 !  f

mf

(3.15)

and remembering (cf. eq. (2.6)) that the mf form a diagonal 2nf  2nf matrix in avor space

  m 0
0 m !

(3.16)

with nf of the masses equal to +m and nf equal to m, one immediately sees that (3.15) is
invariant under the subgroup sp(2nf )  sp(2nf ). the symmetry breaking pattern sp(4nf ) 
sp(2nf )  sp(2nf ) will be conrmed below by an explicit calculation in random matrix theory.

4 random matrix theory

the dirac operator d in the 2  2 representation is antihermitian. to construct a random
matrix ensemble which is hermitian and has orthogonal symmetry, we therefore substitute the
average over gluon eld congurations of the euclidean fermion determinant

6

z(m ) = z da

2nf

yf =1

det(6d + mf )es[a]

(4.17)

(where s[a] denotes the yang-mills action for su (2) in three euclidean dimensions, mf = m for
f = 1, ..., nf and mf = m for f = nf + 1, ..., 2nf ) in the partition function dening qcd3
with an average over a real hermitian random matrix r. we then get a matrix model

z(m) = z dr e n 

2

4 tr(r2)

2nf

yf =1

det(ir + mf )

(4.18)

r is here taken to be a matrix of size n  n , and dr is the invariant (haar) measure. we
take the total density of zero modes (number of small eigenvalues per space-time volume) to be
xed, so we can identify n with the space-time volume [2]. we call the total number of avors
2nf , since we have nf fermion species with mass m and nf with mass m. assuming there
is a spontaneous breaking of avor and/or parity, we will nd the pattern of avor symmetry
breaking, while parity will remain unbroken. it was shown in [19] that parity is spontaneously
broken by the appearance of an anomalous parity-odd chern-simons term at the quantum level in
qcd in three dimensions (indeed, in any odd dimension) for an odd number of massless fermion
species. for an even number of avors, the anomaly does not appear and with our choice of
p -invariant masses, parity remains unbroken also at the quantum level.

as we will see,  is the value of the order parameter for spontaneous symmetry breaking,

its absolute value will be the same for each avor [12]. in order to evaluate z(m) and perform
the integral over the random matrices r, we write the product of fermion determinants as an
integral over grassmann elds

here the indices i, j run from 1 to n . we will make use of the supersymmetric formalism
developed in [18]. we use conjugation of the second kind  =  for grassmann variables

7

(see appendix a of the reference just quoted). this formalism was developed to deal with
integrals over both commuting and grassmann variables, involving graded vectors and matrices.
in (4.20) we have only the fermion-fermion block of [18], since our integration variables are
pure fermionic. our integration measure is

and perform the gaussian integral. here we take care that the matrix c has the same properties
as r (real in the extended sense of the supersymmetric formalism, and hermitian). therefore we
have symmetrized the indices i, j and used rij = rji in completing the square. since grassmann
integrals are always convergent, and the integrals in dr are uniformly convergent in the fermionic
variables,

in (4.28), di is the haar measure for the real antisymmetric matrix i. the i should be
chosen antisymmetric in avor indices since ff g and ff g are antisymmetric, so as to preserve the

end up with

subsequently performing the grassmann integrations, we arrive at

z(m)  z da exp{2n 2tr(aa)} p f n (a + i t ai + m)

(4.31)

where we have rescaled a by a factor of 2. in (4.31) p f denotes the pfaan (square root of the
determinant) of the matrix. note that the pfaan of an antisymmetric matrix is always well
dened. this is our expression for the partition function. in the next section we will evaluate it
using a saddle point analysis.

5 saddle point analysis of the partition function

to begin evaluating the partition function, we will now decompose the antisymmetric matrix a in
(4.31) into polar coordinates [20]. this can be achieved for an arbitrary antisymmetric matrix
by setting

a = u u t ,  =

u is unitary. the integration measure a priori becomes

z da = zu u (4nf )/(sp(2))

2nf

du dj()

(5.33)

the integration over the coset u (4nf )/(sp(2))2nf ensures that there is a one-to-one correspon-
dence between the integration variables in a and those in u u t (cf. [20], ch. 3). the jacobian
j() was not found in [20]. we calculated it and found that it is indeed a function of  only,
and that it is of order nf . indeed, it could never be of order n , therefore it must drop out at
the saddle point in  as n gets large. this will always happen in any similar calculation, so that

11

it is not necessary to know the exact form of the jacobian j(), as long as it is a function of f
only.

however, the presence of the matrices i limits the u -integration to be over the subgroup sp(4nf ).
this is evident when we consider that the matrix u that block-diagonalizes a, also block-
diagonalizes a  a + i t ai = a  iai:

a = u u t

a = u u t

(5.34)

since the values of the matrix elements of a and a do not enter in the angular matrices u ,
but only determine  and . therefore,

 =   u iu   u iu 

(5.35)

we can choose u such that the eigenvalues of  are ordered like in (5.32). but both  and  have
the block-diagonal form appearing in (5.32). therefore also the second term in (5.35) has to have
this form. since ii =  (note that we could have chosen any one of three equivalent forms
for i that are all invariant under the symplectic group, by simply rearranging the components in
i
f ([21], paragraph 10-8), and all of these forms satisfy ii = ), that means that in (5.35)
u iu   i. but u iu t = i is equivalent to u  sp(4nf ). then  = 2. like in [2, 3] we will
determine the saddle point in  at m = 0 and then expand the pfaan at this saddle point to
rst order in m to see the symmetry breaking pattern. at m = 0 the integral takes the simple
form

where we have used that the symplectic matrices are unimodular. the saddle point is at

(5.37)

we will now discuss the choice of saddle point manifold. in [18], the saddle point with equal
number of + and  signs was singled out because for the other potential saddle points, the

12

integrand and measure became independent of some grassmann variables in the supersymmetric
hubbard-stratonovitch matrices. integrating over these grassmann elds then set z(m) to zero.
here, we get the same saddle point, but for a dierent reason, since our s have only commuting
(5.32)).
variables. we can always redene the angular matrices u so that f  0 (cf. eq.
therefore, we can choose the positive sign in (5.37). however, assuming the avor symmetry
is broken spontaneously, the condensate for each avor has to have the same sign as the mass.
this is clear from the proof of the banks-casher formula [13], see also ref. [12]. since half of the
masses are negative, we should choose || =  for half, and || = + for half of the f at the
saddle point.

therefore, our saddle point should be

(5.38)

we now expand the determinant for small m 6= 0 at  = sp. in eq. (4.31) the matrix a +
i t ai + m is antisymmetric. this means the square root of its determinant is a positive real
number. this is conrmed by inspection of its explicit form. we can therefore write

detn/2(a + i t ai + m) = detn/4(a + i t ai + m) detn/4(a + i t ai + m)

(5.39)

this way our nal expression for the partition function will be manifestly real after expanding
the integrand. we then get

z(m)  z du detn/4(u 2spu t + m) detn/4(u 2spu  + m)

(5.41)

the du integral goes over the coset space sp(4nf )/(sp(2nf )  sp(2nf )), due to the structure

obtained the avor symmetry breaking pattern sp(4nf )  sp(2nf )  sp(2nf ). the number of
broken generators is 4n 2
f , which is also the number of unbroken generators. the dimension of
the coset is

m =

4nf (4nf + 1)

2nf (2nf + 1)

6 sum rules

to derive the rst sum rule we will closely follow the method explained in [3]. the sum rules are
obtained by expanding the expression for z(m), eq. (5.41) and comparing the coecients order
by order in m2 to the (normalized) expectation value of the fermion determinant:

*yf yk>0 1 +

m2
2

k !+

the expectation value is dened as

hf (, m)i = r da es[a] (qk,f k
r da es[a] (qk,f k

f

) f (, m)
2) f (, 0)

2

f

(6.43)

(6.44)

where a is the gauge eld and s[a] the euclidean yang-mills action. expanding the integrand in
(5.41) the o(m) term is killed by the group integration. the surviving group integrals at order
m2 have the form (using the same notation as in [3] and setting j   2j)

14

(x) = zu g/h

du tr(u j u t x)tr(u j u x)

(6.45)

where g/h is the coset and x  n mj . the matrices u j u t are antisymmetric, complex and
unimodular. we now choose real, antisymmetric and traceless generators tk, k = 1, ..., mas for
these, where

mas =

4nf (4nf  1)

2

 1

(6.46)

we also wish to choose t1 such that m  mj  = mt1. m is a 4nf  4nf size matrix. therefore
we normalize the generators so that

tr(tktl) = 4nf kl

(6.47)

(note that for antihermitian generators (real and antisymmetric) the minus sign is necessary.) it
is easy to show that for any two antisymmetric unimodular matrices a and b

mas

xk=1

tr(atk)tr(btk) = 4nf tr(ab)

it was proved in [3] that (t1) = (t2) = ... = (tm ) and therefore

(t1) =

1

mas

mas

xk=1z du tr(u j u t tk) tr(u j u tk)

using (6.48) and tr(j 2) = 4nf we now immediately see that

(x) =

1

mas

vol(g/h)(n m)2(4nf )2

inserting this into the expansion we get

(6.51)

where the volume of the coset cancels in the ratio and the three factors of 1
2 in the r.h.s. come
from the expansion of the exponential, from the square of the real part of the trace, and from
j 2 = j 2/2. inserting the value of mas we therefore arrive at the sum rule

* xk>0

1

(n k)2+ =

2nf

2(2nf  1)(4nf + 1)

(6.52)

note that the original number of avors is 2nf . in the published version of this paper, as well
as in the previous electronic version, the wrong sum rule was given due to an error in (6.48) and
some errors of factors of 2.

7 summary and outlook

we have derived the mass dependence of the low-energy eective partition function for parity-
invariant qcd in three dimensions with two quark colors using as a starting point a random
matrix theory with the global symmetries of this gauge theory. the motivation for this was a
universality conjecture according to which the global symmetries of the gauge theory determine
the low-lying spectrum of the theory in the microscopic limit. we assumed that avor symmetry
breaking occurs, and saw that in that case the pattern of this symmetry breaking is sp(4nf ) 
sp(2nf )  sp(2nf ), while parity is unbroken.
we also indicated how to derive the sum rules constraining the small eigenvalues in the spirit
of leutwyler and smilga, and obtained the rst sum rule. similar results had previously been
obtained by other authors (see the introduction) for qcd in four space-time dimensions for the
ensembles labelled by  = 1, 2 and 4 (orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles) and in
three dimensions for  = 2. even though these latter ensembles may be more interesting for the
real world, the 3d  = 1 case treated here may be one of the easiest to simulate on the lattice.
the only case of physical interest remaining is the 3d  = 4 case. a similar treatment of this
case requires dening majorana fermions in euclidean space. some work in this direction was
performed in [3]. other interesting directions of work include nite temperature and chemical
potential studies (see [8, 9, 11] in this context). another, very ambitious project might be to try
similar techniques at the multicritical points of the matrix model where the condensate goes to
zero (cf. [22]).
