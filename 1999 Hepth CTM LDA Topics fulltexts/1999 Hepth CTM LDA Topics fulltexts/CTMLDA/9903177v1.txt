of witten type as twisted supersymmetric theories is presented. low-energy eective
action and a corresponding topological invariant of three-dimensional manifolds are
considered.

introduction

the aim of our work is to present a step made in the direction of understanding of
three-dimensional (3d) topological quantum eld theory (tqft) in the spirit wit-
ten and seiberg have done in the four-dimensional case. actually, we will consider
two microscopic 3d tqfts and sketch their common low-energy consequences
for topology of 3d manifolds.

first of all, let us recall the milestones in the development of four-dimensional
tqft. in 1988, witten proposed a description of donaldsons theory (topologi-
cal invariants of four-dimensional manifolds) in terms of an appropriately twisted
n = 2 susy su(2) pure gauge theory [1]. but not so many mathematical con-
sequences had followed from this approach until 1994 when seiberg-witten (sw)
theory entered the scene. it has appeared that a newly-discovered dual descrip-
tion of the n = 2 theory in low-energy limit [2] provides us a new, alternative
(but essentially equivalent and simpler) formulation of topological invariants of
four-dimensional manifolds [3].

in the rst of our previous papers [4], a physical scenario has been proposed
to reach our present goal using a geometric-topological construction with scalar
curvature distribution compatible with surgery. though the scalar curvature
distribution used agrees with the surgery procedure, nevertheless it is unclear why

1) talk delivered by b. b.

such a distribution should be privileged. in the second paper [5], we have proposed
a simpler and more natural mechanism without any reference to curvature. in fact,
we have directly applied known results concerning low-energy limit of 3d n = 4
susy gauge theory [6].

ii topological field theory

in 3d, we have the two important topological quantum eld theories (of coho-
mological type): topological su(2) gauge theory of at connection and 3d version
of the (topological) sw theory. the former is a 3d twisted n = 4 susy su(2)
pure gauge theory or a 3d version of the donaldson-witten (dw) theory, and by
denition it describes the casson invariant that appropriately counts the number
of at su(2) connections [7] (see, section a). the latter (3d sw) is a 3d twisted
version of n = 4 susy u(1) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet [2], [3]
(see, section b). it is interesting to note that the both theories can be derived from
4d n = 2 susy su(2) pure gauge theory corresponding via twist to dw theory.

a donaldson-witten and casson theory

let us consider rst the usual n = 2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory
in at euclidean space r4 [8]. the yang-mills gauge eld a is embedded in the
n = 2 chiral multiplet a consisting of one n = 1 chiral multiplet  = (b, ) and
one n = 1 vector multiplet w = (, a).2 the n = 2 chiral multiplet can be
arranged in a diamond form,

to exhibit the su(2)i symmetry which acts on the rows. this theory is described
by the action

2) we will use the conventions of wess and bagger [8]. for instance, doublets of the su(2)l (or
su(2)r) rotation symmetries are represented by spinor indices , , . . . = 1, 2 (or , , . . . = 1, 2).
doublets of the internal su(2)i symmetry will be denoted by indices i, j, . . . = 1, 2. these indices
are raised and lowered with the antisymmetric tensor  (or   , ij ) with sign convention such
that 12 = 1 = 21. tangent vector indices are denoted as , , . . . = 1, . . . , 4. the spinor and
tangent vector indices are related with the tensors   = (1,i a),  
 = (1, i a) described
in the appendices a and b of [8] by letting    and   i with 1234 = 1.
covariant derivatives are dened by db = b  [a, b], and the yang-mills eld strength is
f = a   a  [a, a].

where 

i = (, ).

now we will construct twisted tqft. the rotation group k in four-dimensional
euclidean space is locally su(2)l  su(2)r. in addition, the connected component
of the global symmetry group of the n = 2 theory is su(2)i. the theory, when
formulated on a at r4, therefore has a global symmetry group [9]

h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(2)i .

let su(2)r be a diagonal subgroup of su(2)rsu(2)i obtained by sending su(2)i
index i to dotted index  , and let

k = su(2)l  su(2)r .

then, the transformations of the elds under su(2)l  su(2)r are

and, we decompose the gaugino doublet 
[10]:

i into k irreducible representations as

substituting (2) into the lagrangian (1), we have

thus, we have obtained a tqft  donaldson-witten theory.

now we simply assume all the elds to be independent of the fourth coordi-
nate and discard all mention of the fourth coordinate from the lagrangian. the
dimensionally reduced version of (3) is

b seiberg-witten theory

we start again from the n = 2 susy su(2) yang-mills theory. we recall that
the moduli space of the n = 2 susy su(2) yang-mills theory [2] contains two

singular points. at these points the low energy eective theory is n = 2 susy
u(1) theory coupled to an additional massless matter (monopoles or dyons) in the
form of the n = 2 hypermultiplet (sometimes called the scalar multiplet):3

we know that the twist consists of considering as the rotation group the group,
k = su(2)l  su(2)r and this implies that the hypermultiplet eld content is
modied as follows:

iii low-energy consequences

interestingly, it follows from [6] that low-energy eective theory for both 3d
n = 4 susy su(2) case as well as for the 3d n = 4 susy abelian one with
matter hypermultiplet is pure gauge abelian, and the moduli spaces are smooth.
more precisely, we have the so-called atiyah-hitchin manifold (interpreted as the
two-monopole moduli space), a complete hyper-kahler manifold, in the rst case,
and the taub-nut manifold, in the second one.

3d n = 4 supersymmetric abelian gauge theory is described by the following

using the equations of motion for all the elds one can easily show that this action
is invariant under the supersymmetric transformations (13). taking into account
the following substitution

the topological brst transformation b induced by the n = 4 supertransforma-

these brst transformations are o-shell nilpotent up to a gauge transformation

b = 2gauge; e.g., 2

bam = 2mb. the action (14) is also nilpotent but on-

2
shell.

conning ourselves to the contribution of the coulomb branch coming from
abelian at connections on the 3d manifold m3 we should consider a mathematical
object akin to the casson invariant. we have argued in [4] that such an object
should count (algebraically) the number of abelian at connection on a cover of
m3. if m3 arises from s 3 via 0-framed surgery on a knot [12] the 3d invariant is
directly related to the alexander invariant of m3 [13].

iv conclusions

in this paper, we have indicated that both 3d tqft of su(2) at connection as
well as 3d version of topological sw theory can be described in low-energy regime
by the alexander invariant. in a future work, it will be necessary to improve the
analysis to include all contribution coming from the coulomb branch.
