abstract

we show how spin networks can be described and evaluated as feynman
integrals over an internal space. this description can, in particular, be applied
to the so-called simple so(d) spin networks that are of importance for higher-
dimensional generalizations of loop quantum gravity. as an illustration of
the power of the new formalism, we use it to obtain the asymptotics of an
amplitude for the d-simplex and show that its oscillatory part is given by the
regge action.

i. introduction

spin networks were originally introduced by penrose [1] in an attempt to give a combi-
natorial description of spacetime. since then they reappeared in many branches of math-
ematical physics, see, e.g., [2] and references therein.
in particular, spin networks are of
fundamental importance in the loop approach to quantum gravity [3,4]. more recently, with
a development of the formalism of spin foam quantization [58], it was realized that spin
networks that appear in the path integral version of loop quantum gravity are of a very
special type.
in the case of four spacetime dimensions these special spin networks were
discovered in [6,7]. their higher-dimensional analogs were then described in [9]. these spin
networks can be called simple: they satisfy a quantum analog of the simplicity constraint
which requires a bivector to be a wedge product and, as was realized in [9], these are in

certain precise sense the simplest possible spin networks that can be constructed in a given
dimension.

in this paper we give a new description of simple spin networks: we show that they
can be viewed and evaluated as feynman graphs. our construction gives an interesting
perspective on these objects, which are of fundamental importance in the loop approach to
quantum gravity. it also gives us new technical tools: with the help of the feynman graph
description we will be able to obtain the asymptotics of an amplitude for a d-simplex. we
nd the expected regge action asymptotics for the amplitude.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in the rest of this section we remind the
reader the usual description of spin networks and give the main idea of our construction.
it turns out that the description of spin networks as feynman graphs is quite general and
relevant to gauge groups other than so(d) considered in [9]. the main idea of our con-
struction is quite simple even when presented in its full generality. thus, in this section,
we do not restrict ourselves to any particular choice of the gauge group and present a gen-
eral construction. it is then applied in sec. ii to simple so(d) spin networks relevant for
quantum gravity. as an illustration of the usefulness of the new description we utilize it to
derive the asymptotics of the evaluation of a simple so(d) spin network in sec. iii.

let us now remind the reader the standard description of spin networks, see, e.g., [10].

denition 1 given a lie group g (which we assume to be semisimple and compact), spin
network is a triple (, , i), where:
(i)  is an oriented graph;
(ii)  is a labelling of each edge e by an irreducible unitary representation e of g;
(iii) i is a labelling of each vertex v of  by an intertwiner iv mapping the tensor product
of incoming representations at v to the product of outgoing representations at v.

these data dene a function (,,i) on ge invariant under the action of the group at vertices;
here ge is the product of a number of copies of the group g, one for each of e edges of
. thus, spin network can be described as a function which associates a number to each
assignment of group elements ge to the edges e:

(,,i) : ge  c

an explicit construction of this function proceeds as follows. first, for each edge e let us
consider the operator representing the group element ge in the representation e. introducing
a basis in the corresponding representation space one can calculate the matrix elements
u e(ge)n
m. one then takes a tensor product of all these matrix elements to obtain a tensor
u(ge); it has one subscript and one superscript for each edge e. then for each vertex v of
 let s(v) be the set of edges having v as source and let t (v) be the set of edges having
v as target. the intertwiner is a map (commuting with the action of g):

iv : et (v)e  es(v)e.

we can think of iv as of a tensor with one superscript for each edge e  t (v) and one
subscript for each edge e  s(v). one can then form the tensor product of all intertwiners
to obtain a tensor i, and then take the tensor product u(ge)  i. note now that each

2

superscript in u corresponds to a subscript in i and vice versa, because each edge of  lies
in s(v) for one vertex v and in t (w) for one vertex w. therefore, one can contract indices of
u(ge)  i to get a number. this is the value of the function (,,i). one can check that the
function constructed is invariant under the action of the group g, where the group action
is that at the vertices.

before we present our construction we will need the standard notion of a representation
of class 1 (see, e.g., [11]). spin networks that can be represented as feynman graphs are the
ones constructed using only these special representations of g.

denition 2 let  be an irreducible representation of g, and let h be a subgroup of g.
if the representation space v  contains vectors invariant under h, and if all operators
u (h), h  h are unitary, then  is called a representation of class 1 with respect to h.

the signicance of these representations comes from the fact that they can be realized in
the space of functions on the homogeneous space h\g. as we describe below, spin networks
that are constructed using only representations of class 1 with respect to h can be viewed
as feynman graphs on h\g. simple so(d) spin networks of [9] are just such spin networks.
in this case h = so(d  1) and h\g = sd1.

the realization of a representation of class 1 in the space of functions on a homogeneous
space h\g is a particular case of a general description of an irreducible representation 
by shift operators in the space of functions on the group. let us remind the reader this
description. consider matrix elements

u 
x,a(g) := (u (g)x, a),

where x, a are vectors from the representation space v . let us x a. then the functions
u 
x,a(g), x  v  span a subspace in the space l2(g) of square integrable functions on the
group. one can then show that the right regular action of the group g on this subspace
gives an irreducible representation equivalent to . the scalar product in the representation
space is then given by the integral over the group. in the case  is a representation of class 1
with respect to h, and a is a vector invariant under h, the functions u 
x,a(g) are constant on
the right cosets hg and can be regarded as functions on the homogeneous space x = h\g.
the scalar product is then given by an integral over x.

we are now ready to describe spin networks constructed from representations of class
1 with respect to h as feynman graphs on x. let us denote by p ()n(x), x  x an
orthonormal basis in the representation space  realized in the space of functions on x. the
matrix elements of the group operators are then given by:

u (g)n

m = zx

dxp ()

m (x)p ()n(xg),

where  is the invariant normalized measure on x. this gives realization of the matrix
elements as integrals over x. the other building block necessary to construct a spin network
is intertwiner. intertwiners can be characterized by their integral kernels. for a k-valent
vertex one denes the integral kernel iv(x1, . . . , xk) so that:

i ni+1...nk
v m1...mi =

dx1    dxk iv(x1, . . . , xk) p (1)

m1 (x1)    p (i)

mi (xi)p (i+1)ni+1(xi+1)    p (k)nk (xk).

zx

3

the integral kernels iv(x1, . . . , xk) must satisfy the invariance property iv(x1g, . . . , xkg) =
iv(x1, . . . , xk). a special important set of intertwiners is given by:

iv(x1, . . . , xk) = zx

dx(x, x1)    (x, xk)

or

v m1...mi = zx
i ni+1...nk

dx p (1)

m1 (x)    p (i)

mi (x)p (i+1)ni+1(x)    p (k)nk(x).

these special intertwiners are the ones that appear in simple spin networks of [9]. exactly
for such intertwiners it is possible to represent the spin network evaluation as a feynman
graph. let us now introduce what can be called greens function:

g()(x, y) := xn

p ()

n (x)p ()n(y).

this greens function satises the propagator property:

dzg()(x, z)g()(z, y) = g()(x, y).

zx

let us also introduce a propagator in the presence of a source:

g()(x, y; g) := zx

dzg()(x, z)g()(zg, y).

it is clear that g()(x, y; e) = g()(x, y), where e is the identity element of the group. one can
now check that, in the case all spin network intertwiners are of a special type iv described
above, the spin network function (,, i) of the group elements g1, . . . , ge is given by the
feynman graph with the following set of feynman rules:

 with every edge e of the graph  associate propagator g(e)(x, x; ge).

 take a product of all these data and integrate over one copy of x for each vertex.

these rules can be summarized by the following formula:

(,, i)(g1, . . . , ge) = yv zx

dxv ye

g(e)(x, x; ge).

(1)

thus, in the case intertwiners are given by i the evaluation of a spin network on a string of
group elements is given by a feynman graph: one associates the greens function to every
edge and integrates over the positions of vertices.

before we illustrate this general construction on the example of simple so(d) spin net-
works, let us note that this construction can be readily generalized to the case of an arbitrary
spin network. indeed, the restriction of representations labelling the spin network to be those
of class 1 with respect to a xed subgroup h was necessary only to guarantee that the re-
sulting feynman graph lives in the homogeneous space x = h\g. it can be dropped at
the expense of feynman graphs becoming graphs in the group manifold. the restriction
of intertwiners to be of a special type iv can be dropped with the result that the set of

4

feynman rules specied above changes: in this case one has to associate with every vertex
the integral kernel iv(x1, . . . , xk) and then integrate over all the arguments. thus, in the
case of arbitrary intertwiners, the evaluation formula takes the form:

(,,i)(g1, . . . , ge) = yv zx

dxviv(xv)ye

g(e)(x, x; ge).

(2)

here xv stands for a string of arguments x1, . . . , xk of a k-valent intertwiner, and x, x
in the argument of the greens function g(e)(x, x; ge) must be the same as those in two
intertwiners: x must the appropriate argument in iv, e  s(v) and x must be the argument
of i(w), e  t (w).

ii. simple so(d) spin networks

in this section we illustrate the general construction presented above on the example
of simple so(d) spin networks. their relevance to quantum gravity in d dimensions was
explained in [9].

simple so(d) spin networks are the ones constructed from special representations of
so(d). as is well-known, group so(d) has a special class of representations, called spherical
harmonics, that appear in the decomposition of the space of functions l2(sd1) on sd1 into
irreducible components. some properties of these representations are described in appendix
a. using the terminology introduced in sec.
i these representations of so(d) can be
described as representations of class 1 with respect to so(d  1). they are characterized by
a single parameter that we will denote by n in what follows; n is required to be an integer.
these are the representations that were called simple in [9]. a simple so(d) spin network
was dened in [9] as a spin network which is constructed only from simple representations
and whose intertwiners are the special intertwiners i introduced in sec. i.

in the case intertwiners are given by i, the value of a simple spin network on a sequence
of group elements can be evaluated using the general formula (1). in what follows we will
be concerned only with a special case of spin network evaluated on all group elements being
equal to the identity element. this evaluation of a spin network gives a number that
depends only on the graph and on the labelling of its edges by integers ne. evaluation of a
spin network is of special importance for quantum gravity because this is the way to obtain
an amplitude for a spacetime simplex, see [68]. thus, according to our feynman graph
formula (1), the evaluation of a simple spin network is given by

here

(,) = yv zsd1

dxv ye

gne(x, x).

gn (x, y) = xk

k(x)k(y),

(3)

(4)

where we have introduced an orthonormal basis k, k = (k1,    , kd2) n  k1    
kd3  |kd2| in the representation space (see appendix a for a construction of such a

5

basis). the invariance property gn (xg, yg) = gn (x, y) implies that gn (x, y) depends only
on the scalar product (x  y), and it is a standard result [11] that

g(d)

n (x, y) =

d + 2n  2

d  2

c (d2)/2

n

(x  y),

(5)

where c p
n is the gegenbauer polynomial, see appendix b for the denition. the expression
(3) for the evaluation of a simple spin network is a generalization of the result [12] for the
evaluation in d = 4.

example: evaluation of the -graph

let us use the above representation of the simple spin network evaluation to compute the
evaluation of the -graph. this is of importance because the value of the -graph appears
in the normalization of tri-valent vertices. according to (3) the evaluation is given by:

(d)(n1, n2, n3) = z dxdygn1(x, y)gn2(x, y)gn3(x, y).

(6)

using the expression of gn in terms of gegenbauer polynomial (5), this integral can be
computed. it is not equal to zero only if g = (n1 + n2 + n3)/2 is an integer and g  ni 
0, i = 1, 2, 3. in this case one gets:

(d)(n1, n2, n3) =

(g + 2p)(p + 1)
(g + p + 1)(2p)

3

yi=1  (ni + p)(g  ni + p)
(p + 1)(g  ni + 1)! .

(7)

here p = (d  2)/2. to check this result one can check that (6), (7) both satisfy the
recurrence relation (implied by (b3)):

n1 + 1

n1 + p + 1
n3 + 1

n3 + p + 1

(d)(n1 + 1, n2, n3) +

n1 + 2p  1
n1 + p  1

(d)(n1  1, n2, n3) =

(d)(n1, n2, n3 + 1) +

n3 + 2p  1
n3 + p  1

(d)(n1, n2, n3  1),

(8)

(9)

and that (n1, n2, 0) reproduces the orthogonality relation (b5). for d = 4 the above
expression simplies:

(4)(n1, n2, n3) = (n1 + 1)(n2 + 1)(n3 + 1).

(10)

this result can be used to show that the intertwiner used in [9] to dene simple spin
networks in the case of d = 4 coincides with the one proposed in [6]. indeed, the four-valent
intertwiner of [9] reads:

i2,2(p1, p2, q1, q2) = z dxp1(x)p2(x)q1(x)q2(x).

using the kernel of the identity operator on l2(sd1) given by p

4-valent vertex in terms of the sum of the product of two tri-valent ones:

n =0 gn we can expand the

6

i2,2(p1, p2, q1, q2) =



xn =0z dxdyp1(x)p2(x)gn (x, y)q1(y)q2(y).

in short this can be written as

i (d)
2,2 (n1, n2, n3, n4) = xn

xn h(d)(n1, n2, n)(d)(n, n3, n4)i1/2 i (d)

i (d)
2,1 (n1, n2, n)  i (d)

1,2 (n, n3, n4) =

2,1 (n1, n2, n)  i (d)

1,2 (n, n3, n4),

where we have introduced the normalized intertwiner

i (d)
2,1 (n1, n2, n3) = ((d)(n1, n2, n3))1/2i (d)

2,1 (n1, n2, n3).

in the case of d = 4, using the result (10) for the -graph, we get

i (d)
4

(n1, n2, n3, n4) =

[(n1 + 1)(n2 + 1)(n3 + 1)(n4 + 1)]1/2

(n + 1) i (d)

2,1 (n1, n2, n)  i (d)

1,2 (n, n3, n4).



xn =0

up to an overall normalization factor, this vertex is exactly the vertex given in [6].

iii. large spin asymptotics

in this section we use the feynman graph representation of the simple spin networks
to study the asymptotics of a d-simplex amplitude for large n. the results of this section
generalize those of [13] to the case of arbitrary dimension. most of the labor necessary to get
the asymptotics is done in appendix c. here we simple use the obtained there asymptotics
(c1) of the gegenbauer polynomial.

as is explained in refs. [9], the amplitude for a d-simplex is given by the evaluation
of the spin network that is dual to the boundary of the simplex. the (d  2)-simplices
are labelled by simple representations of so(d), i.e., by integers n. the edges of the spin
network dual to the boundary of the simplex are in one-to-one correspondence with the
(d  2)-simplices, and inherit the labels of (d  2)-simplices. as one can easily check, all
vertices of the spin network in question are d-valent. all intertwiners are of the special type
described in sec. i, and, thus, the formula (3) can be used for the evaluation. using the
asymptotics (c1) and the formula (3) we present an asymptotic evaluation the amplitude:
we will use the stationary phase approximation for the integral. our discussion follows
closely that of [13].

to get a feeling about the behavior of the amplitude, we will concentrate only on the
n (cos ). thus, dropping all unimportant for us multiplicative constants,

oscillatory part of c p
we get

(,)  x{kl}


yk<l

kl
zsd1

dx1    dxd+1 eipk<l kl((nkl+p)kl+(1p)/2),

7

where the integral is taken over (d + 1) points  vertices of the spin network  on the unit
(d  1)-sphere, and k, l are indices labelling the vertices k, l = 1, . . . , d + 1. thus, a pair kl
labels a spin network edge, and kl : cos kl = xk  xl. the quantity kl takes values 1 and
the sum is taken over both possibilities for every edge. the rest of the analysis is exactly
the same as in [13]. taking into account the fact that the variation of the angles satisfy the
following identity (see [13]):

vklkl,

xk<l

where vkl are the volumes of (d  2)-simplices inside a geometric d-simplex, one nds that
all kl are either positive or negative, and that the stationary phase values of kl are the
ones corresponding to a geometric d-simplex determined by nkl + p interpreted as volumes
of (d  2)-simplices. then, in the case the number d(d + 1)/2 of edges in the simplex is
even, we get

(,)  cos
xk<l

(nkl + p)kl + 



4
 ,

(11)

where kl are the higher-dimensional analogs of the dihedral angles of the geometric d-
simplex determined by nkl + p and

 =

(d + 1)d

2

(4  d)

is the integer determined by d. in the case d(d + 1)/2 is odd one gets sin instead of cos
in the asymptotics (11). thus, the simplex amplitude has the asymptotics of the exponential
of the regge action, as expected.

appendix a: simple representations of so(d)

what is referred to in this paper as simple representations of so(d) are the usual
spherical harmonics representations. they are irreducible representations of so(d) of class
1 with respect to the subgroup so(d  1) and, therefore, can be realized in the space
of functions on sd1. this partially explains their relevance for quantum gravity in d
dimensions, where the (d  1)-sphere has the geometrical meaning of the boundary of the

8

d-simplex. in this appendix we review some basic properties of these representations. for
more information see, e.g., [11].

the spherical harmonics representations of so(d) are the most obvious ones: they can
be realized in the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree n. let us denote the space
of such polynomials by v (d)

n . then

dimv (d)

n =

(n + d  1)!
n!(d  1)!

.

it turns out, however, that the representation in this space is not irreducible. the invariant
subspace in v (d)
is given, as usual, by the space of polynomials satisfying the laplace
equation in ird. thus, the irreducible representations of this type are realized in the space
of homogeneous harmonic polynomials of degree n. let us denote this space by h(d)
n . as
one can show,

n

dimh(d)

n =

(2n + d  2)(d + n  3)!

(d  2)!n!

.

(a1)

as we have mentioned, these representations are of the class 1 with respect to so(d 1).
n that
n (xd) for
n (x) is the so-called gegenbauer polynomial

choosing the upper-left corner embedding of so(d  1) into so(d), the vector in h(d)
is invariant under the action of so(d  1) is given (up to normalization) by c p
x = (x1, . . . , xd). here p = (d  2)/2 and c p
dened in the next appendix.

an explicit basis in h(d)

n can be constructed by choosing a string of embeddings

so(2)  so(3)     so(d  1)  so(d).

then h (d)
n decomposes into subspaces irreducible with respect to the action of the subgroup
so(d  1). the later again decompose into the irreducible subspaces with respect to the
action of so(d  2) etc. finally, one arrives at so(2) whose irreducible representations are
1-dimensional. thus, we have:

h(d)

n = n

k1=0 k1

k2=0    kd3

kd2=kd3 vkd2.

here vk are 1-dimensional representation spaces of so(2). note that kd2 in the last sum
runs over both positive and negative values. thus, a basis in h(d)
n can be labelled by a
string of integers:

k := (k1, k2, . . . , kd2),

n  k1  k2      |kd2|.

appendix b: properties of gegenbauer polynomials

gegenbauer polynomials are orthogonal polynomials satisfying many dierent properties.
in this appendix we review some of them. for more information of gegenbauer polynomials
see, e.g., [11,14].

appendix c: asymptotics of the gegenbauer polynomial

to get the asymptotics of the gegenbauer polynomial for large n we use the dierential

equation (b4). it can be put into a form similar to that of a wave equation by setting

one gets:

n (cos ) = f () sinp .

n in the rst term. thus, the large n asymptotics is given by

sin[(n + p) + ],

where  is a phase and a is a normalization factor, both arbitrary at this stage. it can be
constrained by using symmetry properties of cn . from the expression for the generating
functional one sees that

cn (x) = (1)n cn (x).

thus,

c (p)
n (cos(  )) = (1)n c (p)

n (cos ).

a simple analysis shows that this restricts  to be

where k is an arbitrary integer. thus, the ambiguity in k is just the overall sign ambiguity.
the constant a can be determined from the normalization condition (b5). one gets:
