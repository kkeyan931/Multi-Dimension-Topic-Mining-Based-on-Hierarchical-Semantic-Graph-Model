abstract

symmetric vacua of heterotic mtheory, characterized by vanishing cohomology classes of

individual sources in the threeform bianchi identity, are analyzed on smooth calabiyau three

folds. we show that such vacua do not exist for elliptically bered calabiyau spaces. how-

ever, explicit examples are found for calabiyau threefolds arising as intersections in both

unweighted and weighted projective space. we show that such symmetric vacua can be com-

bined with attractive phenomenological features such as three generations of quarks and leptons.

properties of the low energy eective actions associated with symmetric vacua are discussed. in

particular, the gauge kinetic functions receive no perturbative threshold corrections, there are

no corrections to the matter eld kahler metric and the associated vedimensional eective

theory admits at space as its vacuum.

1

introduction:

a general property of theories containing branes is that bulk elds are excited by sources located

on those branes. this eect is particularly pronounced in heterotic mtheory [1, 2, 3, 4] where
n = 1 supersymmetric e8 gauge multiplets are localized on two tendimensional orbifold planes
in elevendimensional spacetime. these boundary sources lead, roughly, to a linear variation of

the bulk elds along the single transverse direction and, hence, to strong eects that grow with the

size of this dimension.

when constructing vacua of heterotic mtheory preserving four supercharges, these eects

cause a deformation of the zeroth order calabiyau background [3]. this deformation can be

determined using a strong coupling expansion and is, at present, known only in the linearized

approximation [3, 5]. requiring the validity of this approximation places a bound on the size of

the eleventh dimension [6] and, hence, certain regions of the moduli space are unavailable.

in

the fourdimensional eective action, these deformations induce threshold corrections to the gauge

kinetic functions [3, 6, 7, 5] which dier on the observable and hidden sector branes and can lead to

a strong gauge coupling in one of the sectors. furthermore, they induce corrections to the matter

eld kahler potential [5].

such deformations of the calabiyau background occur quite generically in heterotic mtheory.

they are caused by source terms in the bianchi identity of the mtheory threeform eld. these

source terms have support on each of the orbifold planes and, in general, are nonvanishing cohomo-

logically. as an example, the standard embedding of the spin connection into one of the e8 gauge
groups leads to cohomologically nontrivial sources on each of the orbifold planes. essentially,

this happens because the gravitational contribution to the bianchi identity is split equally between

the two orbifold planes. generically, the same property is shared by nonstandard embedding

vacua [9, 10, 11, 12] as well. typically, the sources turn out to be nontrivial in cohomology and

the calabiyau background receives corrections. however, we will show that not all nonstandard

embedding vacua have this property.

specically, in this paper, we would like to study the possibility of setting the sources in the

threeform bianchi identity to zero individually, on each orbifold plane, at least in cohomology.

vacua with this property are called symmetric vacua. we want to emphasize that the concepts

of symmetric vacua and standard embeddings are dierent, the latter always having nonvanishing

individual sources in the threeform bianchi identity. for heterotic mtheory on k3, symmetric

vacua have been studied in ref. [13]. in ref. [9], it has been shown that a class of heterotic orbifold

models with vanishing threshold corrections exists. in these models, the vanishing corrections are

due to a combination of topological properties and special properties at the orbifold point.

here, we would like to construct symmetric vacua of heterotic mtheory based on smooth

1

calabiyau threefolds. from what we have said, this requires nonstandard embedding vacua and,

hence, the analysis of certain classes of semistable holomorphic vector bundles v over calabiyau

threefolds x. as we will see, the relevant vector bundles needed to construct symmetric vacua
are those with the property that c2(v ) = 1
2 c2(t x), where c2(v ) and c2(t x) are the second chern
classes of v and the tangent bundle of x respectively. we will call such vector bundles symmetric

as well. symmetric vacua have interesting properties, such as the absence of the threshold and

kahler potential corrections to the low energy eective action mentioned above. they also admit

at space as the vacuum solution to the associated vedimensional eective theory.

it is also

possible that they constitute valid solutions even in the region of moduli space with large orbifold

radius, which is usually not accessible.

in section 2, we start by reviewing the general context and by presenting some of the essential

formulae. section 3 is devoted to the study of elliptically bered calabiyau spaces with sections

and semistable holomorphic bundles of the friedmanmorganwitten type [24].

in section 4,

we move on to discuss calabiyau spaces dened as intersections in unweighted and weighted

projective spaces and holomorphic vector bundles of the monad type. finally, in section 5, we

discuss the special properties of symmetric vacua and their associated low energy eective actions.

our results can be summarized as follows. we show that, within the class of elliptically bered

calabiyau threefolds and friedmanmorganwitten vector bundles, no symmetric vector bun-

dles and, hence, no symmetric vacua exist. this conrms the expectation that symmetric vacua

are, in fact, rare and that generically calabiyau vacua do receive corrections. for calabiyau

threefolds dened as intersections in projective space, we rst prove several general properties

of symmetric bundles (of the monad type) such as a lower bound on the number of generations.

then, we construct explicit examples of symmetric bundles on various calabiyau spaces within

this class. again, such bundles turn out to be relatively rare. for example, for the ve calabiyau

threefolds dened as intersections in an unweighted projective space, there exist exactly four sym-

metric bundles (of the monad type), three for the quintic polynomial and one for the intersection
of two cubic polynomials in cp5. furthermore, using two of our examples, one in unweighted

and the other in weighted projective space, we show that symmetric vacua can be combined with

phenomenologically interesting properties such as three generations of quarks and leptons. to rst

nontrivial order, symmetric vacua do not receive corrections at the level of the calabiyau zero

modes. however, massive rst order corrections are generically present. we point out that, due

to the vanishing massless vacuum corrections, all rst order strong coupling corrections to the as-

sociated four and vedimensional low energy eective actions vanish for symmetric vacua. in

particular, the threshold corrections to the gauge kinetic functions and the correction to the matter

eld kahler metric vanish. we also speculate that symmetric vacua might be valid in the region

2

of moduli space with large orbifold size where the strong coupling expansion breaks down in the

nonsymmetric case.

2 general framework:

in this section, we would like to present the general framework for the discussion. our starting

point is the eective action for the strongly coupled heterotic string [1, 2] given by mtheory on the
orbifold s1/z2. as usual, the orbifold coordinate x11 is taken to be in the range x11  [, ]
with the z2 symmetry acting as x11  x11. this leads to two xed ten-planes at x11 = 0 and ,
each of which carries an n = 1 supersymmetric e8 gauge multiplet.

we would like to consider vacua of this theory associated with n = 1 supergravity theories in

four dimensions. to lowest order, this implies the spacetime structure

m11 = m4  s1/z2  x

(1)

where m4 is fourdimensional minkowski space and x is a calabiyau threefold. as is well
known [3, 4], the above direct product structure is valid only to lowest order in an expansion in the
elevendimensional newton constant . more precisely, the rst corrections appear at order 2/3

and produce a deformation of the above space in both the orbifold and calabiyau components.
the key ingredient in the theory that leads to these deformations is the bianchi identity 1

for the eld strength g = 6 dc of the m-theory threeform eld c. here j (0) and j (n +1) are

for the vacua under consideration, the gauge elds f (1) and f (2) are associated with holomorphic

vector bundles v1 and v2 on the calabiyau space x while the curvature r is associated with the
tangent bundle t x. note that the gravitational contribution tr(r  r) to the bianchi identity
has been split equally between the two orbifold planes. this can be seen from the factors 1/2 in

front of tr(r r) that appear in eq. (3). for generality, we have also allowed for additional sources
j (i), where i = 1, . . . , n , in the bianchi identity which could arise from vebranes in the vacuum.

such vacua with vebranes have been constructed and analyzed in ref. [12, 17, 18]. here, we will

only need some elementary properties. the n vebranes are oriented transversely to the orbifold
and located at x11 = x1, . . . , xn . to preserve fourdimensional poincare invariance and n = 1
supersymmetry, they stretch across the uncompactied space m4 and wrap on holomorphic curves
c(i)
2 within the calabiyau space x. this orientation implies for their sources that

j (i) = (c(i)
2 ) ,

i = 1, . . . , n ,

(4)

where (c(i)

2 ) is the poincare dual fourform to the holomorphic curve c(i)

are the second chern classes for the vector bundle vi and the tangent bundle t x of x respectively
and

[w ] =

n

xi=1h(c(i)
2 )i

(7)

is the fourform class of the vebranes. the brackets [. . . ] indicate the cohomology class of the

associated fourform. this topological condition guarantees anomalyfreedom of the vacuum and

it is necessary (and sucient) for the bianchi identity to be soluble. it states that the total right

hand side of the bianchi identity is topologically trivial, as it should be. however, this is not

the case for the cohomology classes of the individual source terms (cid:2)j (n)(cid:3), for n = 0, . . . , n + 1,
which are generally nonvanishing. hence, the sources themselves generally do not vanish, that is,
j (n) 6= 0. this leads to a nonvanishing eld strength g which, in turn, causes a deformation of
the spacetime (1).

as a familiar example, let us consider the standard embedding. the anomaly constraint (5)

can be satised if one takes

c2(v1) = c2(t x),

c2(v2) = 0

(8)

2we will consider vector bundles v with c1(v ) = 0 throughout the paper.

4

and

[w ] = 0.

(9)

the last statement asserts that the standard embedding does not allow vebranes in the vacuum,

as expected. therefore, n = 0. note from eq. (3) and (8) that the cohomology classes of the

remaining sources are given by

hj (0)i = 

1
322 [tr(r  r)] ,

hj (1)i =

1
322 [tr(r  r)] .

(10)

since c2(t x) 6= 0, the cohomology class of the source on each of the orbifold planes is nonvanishing.
this is due to the aforementioned fact that the gravitational part of the bianchi identity has been

equally distributed onto each of the two orbifold planes. solution (8), (9) is an attractive choice,

since it can be explicitly realized at the level of elds by embedding the spin connection into the

rst e8 gauge group and choosing the second e8 gauge vacuum to be trivial. that is

tr(f (1)  f (1)) = tr(r  r) ,

tr(f (2)  f (2)) = 0 .

it follows from eq. (3) that the sources are explicitly given by

j (0) = 

1
322 tr(r  r) ,

j (1) =

1
322 tr(r  r) .

(11)

(12)

since the source cohomology classes are non-vanishing, it follows that the sources themselves cannot

be set to zero. therefore, the standard embedding leads to a nonvanishing eld strength g and,

hence, to a deformation of the calabiyau vacuum [3].

the main point of this paper is to look for solutions of the anomaly constraint (5) which

possibly allow for the vanishing of the right hand side of the bianchi identity. in other words, we
are interested in vacua where each source term j (n), for n = 0, . . . , n + 1, on the right hand side

of the bianchi identity potentially vanishes. for such vacua, the fourform eld strength g can be

set to zero and, hence, the spacetime (1) remains uncorrected, at least to rst nontrivial order

in the  expansion. the task of nding such vacua can be broken into two steps. first, if each
of the sources is to vanish, it necessarily must vanish in cohomology, [j (n)] = 0. this is easily

achieved for the vebrane sources. we simply consider vacua without vebranes, that is, we take
n = 0. in this case, the vebrane sources j (i) and their cohomology classes simply do not exist.

in the following, we concentrate exclusively on vacua without vebranes. the situation is more

complicated for the sources on the orbifold planes. for those sources to be cohomologically trivial,
that is [j (0)] = [j (1)] = 0, it follows from eq. (3) that we need to set

htr(f (1)  f (1))i =htr(f (2)  f (2))i =

1
2

[tr(r  r)] .

5

(13)

consequently, we have

c2(v1) = c2(v2) =

1
2

c2(t x) .

which satises the topological constraint (5) if we take

[w ] = 0,

(14)

(15)

consistent with the above assumption. we will refer to vacua with property (14) and no vebranes

as symmetric vacua. second, having chosen a calabiyau threefold x and vector bundles v1 and
v2 realizing such a symmetric vacuum, one has removed the topological obstruction of setting the
orbifold sources to zero. to actually set the sources to zero, however, one needs to explicitly choose
a spin connection on t x and specic gauge connections on v1 and v2 so that j (0) = j (1) = 0. this
would imply that

tr(f (1)  f (1)) = tr(f (2)  f (2)) =

1
2

tr(r  r).

(16)

unlike in the case of the standard embedding where the relations (11) are satised at the level of

elds, it is not clear that vacuum solutions satisfying constraint (16) can be achieved. therefore,

for the purposes of this paper, we restrict ourselves to solving the topological part of the problem
if we cannot be sure that sources j (0) and j (1) vanish, then

specied by eq. (13). however,

it is conceivable that the eld strength g is again nonvanishing and, hence, spacetime (1) is

deformed. what simplication, then, has been achieved by using symmetric vacua? the answer

is, considerable simplication. to see this, note that we have shown elsewhere [5, 16] that the

corrections, due to the deformation of spacetime (1), to the the eective action of the zero modes

are all proportional to charges i dened by

i(i) = c2(v1) 

1
2

c2(t x) = c2(v2) +

1
2

c2(t x)

(17)

here {i}i=1,...,h1,1 is a basis of h 1,1(x). the quantities on the right hand side of this equation are
exactly those that are set to zero for symmetric vacua. we conclude that all charges i vanish for
symmetric vacua. therefore, for symmetric vacua, even if there is a deformation of spacetime (1)
due to nonvanishing sources j (0) and j (1), to rst nontrivial order, this deformation does not

eect the low energy zero mode action as a consequence of the vanishing of the cohomology classes

(cid:2)j (0)(cid:3) = (cid:2)j (1)(cid:3) = 0. this motivates us to search for symmetric vacua in this paper. finally, note

that eq. (14) is much stronger than the anomaly cancellation condition (5) so that we are, in fact,

looking for a small subclass of all nonanomalous vacua.

the problem we are going to address, then, is to nd, for a given calabiyau threefold x,

holomorphic vector bundles v with the property that

c2(v ) =

c2(t x) .

1
2

6

(18)

we will call such vector bundles symmetric bundles of the calabiyau space x. it is understood,

in what follows, that a symmetric embedding can then be constructed by choosing both relevant

bundles v1 and v2 of the symmetric type. note again that the standard embedding implies that
c2(v ) = c2(t x), which diers from the condition (18) by a crucial factor of 1/2. hence, the
standard embedding does not provide us with symmetric bundles.

for phenomenological reasons, we will be interested in the number of chiral generations of

quarks and leptons associated with a (symmetric) bundle v . it is given by

ngen =

c3(v )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

furthermore, we will focus on holomorphic vector bundles with structure group g = su (n) only.

this is phenomenologically motivated, since the choices n = 3, 4 and 5 lead to the lowenergy

groups (the commutants of g in e8) e6, so(10) and su (5), that is, to attractive grandunied
groups.

3 elliptically fibered calabiyau threefolds:

we will now consider the possibility of symmetric vacua for elliptically bered calabiyau three

folds. let us rst review the properties of these spaces that are essential to our discussion.

the relevant calabiyau threefolds x are given as an elliptic bration over a twofold base
b with section  : b  x. it can be shown [26] that the base space b is restricted to del pezzo,
enriques, or hirzebruch surfaces or certain blowups of the latter. the second chern class of such

a calabiyau space can be expressed in terms of the base b and the section  as

c2(t x) = c2(b) + 11 c1(b)2 + 12 c1(b) ,

(20)

where c1(b) and c2(b) are the rst and second chern classes of the base respectively. next, we
have to specify the class of holomorphic vector bundles over elliptically bered calabiyau spaces

on which we intend to focus. we concentrate on the vector bundles with structure group su (n)

constructed by friedman, morgan and witten [24]. these bundles are parameterized by a class
  h2(b) and a rational number  subject to the constraints

n is odd,  = m +

n is even,  = m,

1
2
 = c1(b) mod 2

(21)

(22)

where m is an integer. the second chern class of these bundles v can be expressed in terms of ,

, n and properties of the bration. one nds [24] that

c2(v ) =  

1
24

c1(b)2(cid:0)n3  n(cid:1) +

7

1

2(cid:18)2 

1

4(cid:19) n (  nc1(b)) .

(23)

let us now try to nd symmetric vector bundles in this class. the obstruction to having such

a symmetric bundle is given by

in order to solve the equation u = 0, we split u into a base component and a ber component as

u = c2(v ) 

1
2

c2(t x) .

(24)

here ub is a second homology class in the base while a is an integer that counts the number of
bers f . inserting the above chern classes, one nds

u = ub + af.

(25)

ub =  (  6c1(b))
a = 

1
24

c1(b)2(n3  n) +

1

4(cid:19) n (  nc1(b)) 

(26)

11
2

c1(b)2 

1
2

c2(b) .

(27)

for a symmetric bundle, we must demand that ub = 0. this xes the bundle parameter  to be

 = 6c1(b) .

(28)

from eqs. (21) and (22), we see that this choice of  is always acceptable for odd n. for even n,

it may or may not be compatible with the constraint (22). keeping this restriction in mind, we

try to satisfy the remaining condition for a symmetric bundle, namely that a = 0. inserting  in

eq. (28) into (27) leads to the relation

between the rst and second chern class of the base. the numbers n (, n) are given by

c2(b) = n (, n) c1(b)2

(29)

(30)

n (, n) =(cid:18)62 

3

2(cid:19) n(6  n) 

1
12

(n3  n)  11 .

what remains to be checked is whether the relation (29) can be satised for certain base spaces b
and numbers , n. to do this, let us look at the explicit values of c1(b)2 and c2(b) for the various
allowed base spaces b as given in table 1. for the enriques surface e and the del pezzo surface

dp9 we have

c1(b)2 = 0,

c2(b) 6= 0.

(31)

this is incompatible with the relation (29) and, hence, no symmetric bundles exist for these base

spaces. from table 1, we have for all other base spaces that

1
2 

c2(b)
c1(b)2  11.

(32)

on the other hand, it is easy to show that the numbers n (, n) satisfy either n (, n) < 0 or
n (, n)  20 for all allowed values of n and . hence the relation (29) can never be satised.

we conclude that for the base spaces listed in table 1, no symmetric vector bundles of the

friedmanmorganwitten type exist. this result shows clearly that the property of being a sym-

metric bundle is quite restrictive.

intersections in weighted projective space:

the condition (18) for a symmetric vector bundle is an equation in the vector space h 2,2(x)
and, therefore, provides h1,1 constraints on the bundle data.

in the previous section we have,

unsuccessfully, looked for symmetric bundles over elliptically bered calabiyau threefolds. for
those calabiyau space, we always have h1,1  2. therefore, it seems worthwhile to minimize the
number of constraints and consider calabiyau spaces with h1,1 = 1.

a large class of calabiyau threefolds with this property is provided by intersections in both

unweighted and weighted projective space. we will focus our attention on such spaces in this sec-
tion 3. partially, this is motivated by earlier approaches to heterotic model building within this

class, particularly in ref. [19, 20]. let us review the relevant properties of these spaces following
ref. [21, 22]. the starting point is the weighted projective space cpn +3
dinates (x  )=0,...,n +3 and weights w = (w )=0,...,n +3. the space x  cpn +3
zero locus of n polynomials p1(x), . . . , pn (x) with degrees p = (p)=1,...,n , where p = deg(p).
the rst chern class of x is given by

x=1

(33)

here j = c1(o(1)) is the rst chern class of the hyperplane bundle o(1). for x to be a calabiyau
space, we want that c1(t x) = 0 and, hence, that

n +3

w =

(35)

3weighted projective space is singular. if these singularities intersect the calabiyau space they have to be blown
up in order to arrive at a smooth manifold. this creates new classes and, hence, a manifold with h1,1 > 1. for the
purpose of this paper, we concentrate on cases where this does not happen, so that indeed h1,1 = 1.

(36)

next, we have to specify a class of holomorphic vector bundles. in the following, we are going

to use the so called monads dened by the short exact sequence [19, 23, 20]

(37)

here, the map between the two sums of line bundles is dened by the polynomials qi

a(x) with

mi > na > 0

(38)

for all i = 1, . . . , m and all a = 1, . . . , n + m . the vector bundle v is then specied by the two

sets of integers (mi)i=1,...,m and (na)a=1,...,n+m . it is denoted by

v = v (m1, . . . , mm ; n1, . . . , nn+m ) .

before we discuss explicit examples, it is useful to prove some general properties of symmet-

ric bundles in the setting described above. let us focus on a specic calabiyau threefold x

represented by weights (w) and polynomials of degree (p). for this space x, dene the quantity

q =

1

2  n
x=1

p2

then we are interested in vector bundles v = v (na; mi) on x with the properties

mi =

(45)

(46)

(47)

the rst condition is just the statement that c1(v ) = 0. the second one states that c2(v ) =
1
2 c2(t x) and, hence, that v is a symmetric bundle. furthermore, we dene the quantity c by

m3

i =

m

xi=1

n+m

xa=1

n3

a + c .

using the bound (38), it is then easy to prove the inequalities

c > 2q  2s

(48)

(49)

which must hold for any symmetric monad vector bundle on x. recall here that q depends on

calabiyau data only while c and s depend on the vector bundle. the rst part of this inequality

can be used, together with eq. (44), to nd a lower bound on the number of generations associated

with symmetric vector bundles. this bound is given by

ngen >

q

.

(50)

note that the right hand side depends on data of the calabiyau threefold only. therefore, the

above bound must be satised for any symmetric (monad) vector bundle on the given calabiyau

space x.

so far the integers (mi) and (na) dening the vector bundle are not bounded from above. simi-
larly, the number m of line bundles is not bounded. it turns out, however, that symmetric bundles

are possible only if those numbers do not exceed certain maximal values. this is summarized in

the following two statements.

statement 1 if na > nmax for any a or mi > mmax for any i, where nmax = q + 1  n  m and
mmax = q + 2  2m , then v = v (mi; na) is not a symmetric bundle.

table 2: symmetric bundles for quintic in cp4

statement 2 if m > mmax where mmax = q n, then v = v (mi; na) is not a symmetric bundle.

these two statements can easily be proven using the inequality (49). they are useful because, for

a given calabiyau threefold, they only leave a nite set of monad vector bundles as candidates

for symmetric bundles. scanning this nite set, we can then nd all symmetric monad bundles for

a given calabiyau space.

we would now like to apply the above results to a number of explicit examples, thereby showing

that symmetric vector bundles indeed exist. as already mentioned, for phenomenological reasons,

we are mainly interested in su (n) bundles with n = 3, 4, 5. in the following examples, we will focus

on these three cases. we start with the ve calabiyau spaces that can be dened as intersections

in a single unweighted projective space.

example 1: quintic polynomial in cp4

using the above notation, the quintic is specied by n = 1, w = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and p = (5). this

leads to

q = 10 ,

j 3 = 5 .

zx

the maximal integers for which symmetric bundles are possible are then given by

nmax = 11  n  m ,

mmax = 12  2m ,

mmax = 10  n .

(51)

(52)

scanning the region na  nmax, mi  mmax, m  mmax one nds three symmetric monad bundles.
they are given in table 2. we conclude that, for the quintic, there is exactly one symmetric monad

bundle for each rank n = 3, 4, 5.

example 2: intersection of two cubic polynomials in cp5

this space is dened by n = 2, w = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) and p = (3, 3). one nds

q = 6 ,

j 3 = 9

and

nmax = 7  n  m ,

mmax = 8  2m ,

mmax = 6  n .

(54)

using these maximal numbers, one can show that there exists a unique rank 3 symmetric vector

bundle for this space. it is given in table 3.

example 3: other intersections in unweighted projective space

there are three more calabiyau spaces that can be dened as intersections in a single unweighted
projective space, namely the intersection of a quadric and a quartic in cp5, the intersection of
two quadrics and a cubic in cp6 and the intersection of four quadrics in cp7. using the method

described above, one can show that no symmetric monad bundles of rank n = 3, 4, 5 exist for these

three spaces.

to summarize our results so far, we have shown that for the ve calabiyau spaces dened in

a single unweighted projective space, there exist exactly four symmetric monad bundles of rank
n = 3, 4, 5, three for the quintic in cp4 and one for the intersection of two cubics in cp5. let us

now turn to two further examples in weighted projective space.

example 4: degree 6 polynomial in cp4

given those bounds, we nd exactly the ve symmetric bundles listed in table 4.

(56)

example 5: two degree 6 polynomials in cp5

1,1,2,2,3,3

this space is dened by n = 2, w = (1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3) and p = (6, 6). it has also been used in ref. [20]

to construct a (nonsymmetric) threefamily model with the standard model gauge group. we nd

j 3 = 1

zx

nmax = 23  n  m ,

mmax = 24  2m ,

mmax = 22  n .

(57)

(58)

using those bounds, we nd a total of 15 symmetric bundles for this space. they are listed in

table 5.

this concludes our list of explicit examples. we have seen that symmetric vector bundles on

calabiyau threefolds in both unweighted and weighted projective spaces exist. the ve calabi

yau spaces in unweighted projective space allow for exactly four symmetric (monad) bundles of rank

n = 3, 4, 5. our nal two examples showed that it is somewhat easier to nd symmetric bundles on

calabiyau threefolds in weighted projective space. still, it is clear that such symmetric bundles

are relatively rare objects.

based on the above experience, we would now like to ask whether symmetric vacua can have

interesting phenomenological properties, such as three chiral families of quarks and leptons in the

observable sector. the above list of examples does not contain a single case with three generations.

given the lower bound (50) on the number of generations for symmetric (monad) bundles, this is

not surprising. however, as usual, we are not necessarily interested in getting three generations on

the original calabiyau threefold x. instead, in order to be able to break the grand unied group

by wilson lines, we would like to consider nonsimply connected calabiyau threefolds dened

by y = x/d, where d is a freely acting discrete automorphism group on x. assuming that we

are able to lift the automorphism d to the vector bundle v (so it denes a bundle vy on y ), the
new number of generations on y is given by

where ngen is the number of generations on x and |d| is the order of the group d. it is for this
new number of generations that we require

ngen(y ) = ngen/|d|

(59)

ngen(y ) = 3.

(61)

and symmetry property (14) continues to hold on y . hence, the quotient vacuum is a symmetric

vacuum. in order to construct threefamily quotient manifolds y , the interesting symmetric vacua

on x are those with a generation number that is a multiple of three. indeed, there are a few such

examples contained in the above tables.

there is one more constraint that has to be satised in order for the quotient symmetric vacuum

to be consistent. this is the level matching condition of ref. [27]. let us briey summarize this

constraint. consider a calabiyau threefold dened as the intersection of polynomials in projective
space with coordinates x  . let d = zn be a discrete group with generator g which acts on the
coordinates as

where  = exp(2i/n ) and k are integer charges and assume that d is an automorphism of this
calabiyau space. also assume that this automorphism lifts to a vector bundle v over the calabi

g : x   k x  ,

(62)

15

yau threefold. this will be the case if one chooses the zn charges ka of the coordinates a of the
line bundles o(na) that appear in the exact sequence (37) in a specic way [23, 20], to be discussed
below. for the two vector bundles v1 and v2 on the orbifold planes there are two sets of charges
k1a and k2a, respectively. then, the level matching condition of ref. [27] states that these charges
should satisfy

x

k = xa

k1a =xa

2a mod 2n

k2a = 0 mod 2

(63)

(64)

for n even. for n odd we only have the rst constraint with 2n replaced by n .

in order to make the above line of thought explicit, we consider the calabiyau threefold of
example 2 dened by the intersection of two cubic polynomials in cp5. as we have seen, this

space has a unique rank 3 symmetric vector bundle

v = v (2, 2, 2; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)

with ngen = 27. let us choose the two cubic polynomials

p1(x) =

5

x=0

a(x  )3 ,

p2(x) =

b(x  )3 .

5

x=0

(65)

(66)

to dene the calabiyau threefold x. then, for generic choices of the coecients a and b,
the manifold x is nonsingular. furthermore, x admits an automorphism d = z3  z3 with
generators g1 and g2 acting as

g1 : x   k x  ,

g2 : x   l x 

where  = exp(2i/3) and k , l are integer charges. pick, for example

k = (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2) ,

l = (0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2) .

(67)

(68)

the set of xed points under the z3  z3 transformations (67) can be shown to have complex
dimension one. generically, a threefold x in cp5 does not intersect a curve. hence, generically,

d is freely acting on x and we can dene the quotient calabiyau threefold y = x/d. we

should also lift d to an automorphism of the bundle v . as a rst step, we have to choose the
z3  z3 charges (ka, la) for the coordinates a of the line bundles o(na) that appear in the exact
sequence (37). furthermore, we should pick explicit polynomials qi
a(x) in this exact sequence.
these polynomials each inherit a z3  z3 charge from the charges on x  . then d lifts to a
symmetry of the vector bundle v if the above charges are chosen in such a way that aqi
a(x) is

16

invariant under d for all a and i [23, 20]. for the case at hand, this can indeed be done. for

example, we can choose the charges of a as

k = (0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2) ,

l = (0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2) .

(69)

a(x) should be
it is not hard to show that these linear polynomials can be chosen so that they

it follows from the structure of the vector bundle v (65), that all polynomials qi
linear in x .
inherit the z3  z3 charges (ka,la) from the coordinates x . it is then clear that aqi
a(x) is
indeed invariant for all a and i. hence, d lifts to an automorphism of the vector bundle v . as

a consequence, v denes a symmetric vector bundle on the quotient space y with ngen(y ) = 3.
a symmetric vacuum can be constructed by taking, for example, v1 = v2 = v . finally, we must
check the level matching constraint. having chosen v1 = v2 = v then, for the rst z3 symmetry,
we set k1a = k2a = ka. it is easy to check that the level matching condition is satised. similarly,
this can be veried for the second z3.

to summarize, we have found a symmetric rank 3 vector bundle v with three generations.
choosing v1 = v2 = v , we obtain a symmetric vacuum with low energy gauge group e6  e6 and
three generations in the observable as well as in the hidden sector. furthermore, since the space y

is not simplyconnected, we can introduce wilson lines to break the observable sector gauge group
e6 spontaneously to su (3)  su (2)  u (1)3.

let us consider another example with similar properties, this time in weighted projective space.

we start with the intersection of two polynomials of degree 6 in cp5

1,1,2,2,3,3, as in example 5 above.

from table 5, we use the second to last bundle

v = v (4, 3, 3, 3; 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) .

this is a rank 5 bundle with ngen = 18. we consider the symmetry d = z6 generated by

with  = exp(2i/6) and the charges k given by

g : x   k x 

k = (0, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4) .

(70)

(71)

(72)

one can choose two degree 6 polynomials that admit this symmetry and dene a nonsingular

manifold. the set of xed points under the z6 transformations (71) can be shown to be at most
a complex curve. again, generically, a threefold x in cp5
1,1,2,2,3,3 does not intersect a curve and,
it follows that we can dene the quotient calabiyau

therefore, the symmetry is freely acting.

threefold y = x/d. we must now lift d to an automorphism of the bundle v . to do this, we
have to apply the same procedure as in the previous example. we choose z6 charges ka for the

17

coordinates a and pick explicit polynomials qi
invariant under d for all a and i. for the case at hand, let us choose

a(x). then the combinations aqi

a(x) should be

k = (1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 4, 5, 5, 0) .

(73)

it is then easy to show that one can pick polynomials qi

a(x) with the correct properties. hence d
lifts to an automorphism of the bundle v . furthermore, v species a bundle on y with ngen = 3.
a symmetric vacuum is obtained by choosing, for example, v1 = v2 = v . setting k1a = k2a = ka
in eq. (63) and (64), we can verify that the level matching constraints are satised.

in summary, we have found a symmetric rank 5 bundle with three generations. the low energy
theory has a gauge group su (5)  su (5) with three generations in both the observable and the
hidden sector. again, we can introduce wilson lines on y to break the observable sector gauge
group su (5) spontaneously to su (3)  su (2)  u (1).

5 properties of symmetric vacua

we would now like to discuss some of the properties of symmetric vacua and their associated four

and vedimensional eective actions.

let us begin with the implications for the fourdimensional eective action. generically, this

action has two types of strong coupling corrections at rst nontrivial order. first, there is the

wellknown threshold correction to the gauge kinetic functions [7, 5, 8, 16]

f (1,2) = s  sit i

(74)

where f (1) and f (2) correspond to the observable and hidden sector. secondly, there are corrections

to the matter eld kahler metric [5, 16] which has the form

zij = ekt /3(cid:20)kbij 

si
s + s

i

bij(cid:21) .

(75)

here kt is the kahler potential of the t moduli, kb is a bundle kahler metric and b some
associated connection. the indices i, j, . . . run over dierent generations. these quantities have

been dened in ref. [25] but need not concern us in detail here. the corrections are of linear order

in the strong coupling expansion parameter s given by

s =(cid:16) 

4(cid:17)2/3 2

v2/3

.

(76)

here, we recall that  is the 11dimensional newton constant and  is the radius of the orbifold while

v is the calabiyau volume. furthermore, these corrections are proportional to the topological

18

charges i. this observation is crucial in our context. as already mentioned, in terms of the
underlying bundles these charges are specied by

i(i) = c2(v1) 

1
2

c2(t x) = c2(v2) +

1
2

c2(t x) .

(77)

where {i}i=1,...,h1,1 is a basis of h 1,1(x). the quantities on the right hand side of this equation
are exactly those that are set to zero for symmetric vacua. hence we conclude that all charges i
vanish for symmetric vacua. most importantly, this implies the vanishing of the strong coupling

corrections in the gauge kinetic functions (74) and the matter eld kahler metric (75) above. from

the above argument, those corrections vanish for topological reasons and, hence, irrespectively of

the specic values of moduli. furthermore, the gauge kinetic functions are not expected to receive

corrections at higher loop order. therefore, they are perturbatively uncorrected for symmetric

vacua and are simply given by

f (1,2) = s .

(78)

this equation holds in the weakly coupled limit as well. however, there it is valid only approxi-
matively since |sit i|  |s| in this region of moduli space. for symmetric vacua, the important
dierence is that the threshold correction vanishes exactly throughout all of (large radius) moduli

space. similarly, for symmetric vacua the kahler metric does not receive strong coupling corrections

to this order and is given by

zij = ekt /3kbij .

(79)

let us next discuss the vedimensional eective action [14, 15, 16] of heterotic mtheory. this
theory is a vedimensional n = 1 supergravity theory coupled to two fourdimensional n = 1
theories on the orbifold planes. the strong coupling corrections manifest themselves in a gauging

of the bulk supergravity. specically, a certain u (1) isometry associated with the threeform axion

in the universal hypermultiplet coset space su (2, 1)/u (2) is gauged. the gauge connection is
the xed linear combination iai, where the sum runs over the graviphoton in the supergravity
multiplet and the h(1,1)  1 vector elds in the vector supermultiplets. the i coecients are the
above topological charges. as usual, this gauging implies the existence of potential energy terms

in the bulk supergravity theory proportional to the coecients ij. this potential obstructs
instead, the ground state of the
at space from being a solution of the equations of motion.

vedimensional theory turns out to be a nontrivial bps double threebrane given by

ds2

5 = a(y)2dxdx  + b(y)2dy2

v = v (y)

19

(80)

dijkf if jf k(cid:19)2

dijkf jf k = hi,

hi = 22k3i|y| + ci

(81)

(82)

here v is the dilaton eld, f i are functions of y, dijk are the intersection numbers of the calabi
yau threefold, ka and ci are constants and the i are the topological charges. to obtain the
fourdimensional eective theory one has to reduce on this nontrivial bps domain wall. now for

symmetric vacua, as we have seen above, i = 0. hence the gauging, the gauge connection and the
associated potential terms are absent in vedimensional eective theories based on such vacua. in
this case, the functions hi in (82) become constants, as do the functions f i. hence, a, b and v
in (81) are constants and the bps threebrane (80) degenerates to a solution with at spacetime
s1/z2  m4 and a constant dilaton.

finally, we would like to discuss some properties of symmetric vacua. let us rst review the

general situation for (not necessarily symmetric) vacua. the elevendimensional solution describing

a vacuum is determined as an expansion around a pure calabiyau background [3]. only the rst

nontrivial terms in this expansion are known and they have been determined in ref. [5, 12]. the

size of these rst order corrections is controlled by s, dened above, and

r =

v1/6


(83)

more precisely, the rst order corrections are given as an expansion in harmonics on the calabi

yau threefold. hence, they have a massless part corresponding to zero eigenvalue harmonics

(zero modes of the calabiyau space) and a massive part corresponding to the nonzero eigenvalue

harmonics. these massless and massive parts are of order s and sr, respectively.

it is clear that, generically, this linearized solution is sensible only as long as s  1 and
if these constraints are violated, higher order terms in the equations of motion (for

sr  1.
example quadratic terms in the elevendimensional einstein equation) become important and the

linear approximation breaks down. also, beyond linear order one expects (partially unknown)
corrections of order 4/3 to the elevendimensional action to become important. at any rate, if the

parameters (76) and (83) approach unity the linearized supersymmetric background is invalidated

and, at present, there is no all order version that could replace it. this remains true even if

20

one had arranged both gauge couplings on the orbifold planes to be perturbative. as a result,

supersymmetric vacua are known only in a restricted portion of the moduli space.

let us now discuss what happens for symmetric vacua. as we have already mentioned, the

corrections to the calabiyau background are caused by the nonvanishing source terms in the

bianchi identity (2). for symmetric vacua, each source term in this bianchi identity vanishes in

cohomology. as a consequence, the massless part of the corrections vanishes. indeed, the massless

part is proportional to si with the charges i dened above. for a symmetric embedding, the
source terms in this bianchi identity, although zero in cohomology, might not, in general, vanish

identically. correspondingly, the massive part of the corrections to the vacuum does not necessarily

vanish for symmetric vacua.

symmetric vacua remove the rst obvious obstruction to making s large. to see this let us
assume that sr  2/3/v1/2 still remains small so that we do not need to worry about the
massive part of the solution. then there are no sizeable linear corrections to the calabiyau

background (since the massless part vanishes) and, at the same time, higher order terms in the
equations of motion remain small. we still have to worry about unknown correction of order 4/3

to the action that we have not taken into account. those may reintroduce large corrections at the
quadratic order 4. we do not know whether or not this happens but we may at least speculate that

symmetric vacua are special enough to prevent such higher order corrections to occur. then such
vacua would allow one to access the part of the moduli space with s  1.
