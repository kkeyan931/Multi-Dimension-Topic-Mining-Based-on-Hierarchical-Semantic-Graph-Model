we consider a (2 + 1)-dimensional mechanical system with the lagrangian linear in the torsion of a light-like
curve. we give hamiltonian formulation of this system and show that its mass and spin spectra are dened
by one-dimensional nonrelativistic mechanics with a cubic potential. consequently, this system possesses the
properties typical of resonance-like particles.

1. introduction

the search of lagrangians, describing spinning
particles, both massive and massless, has a long
story. the conventional approach in this direc-
tion consists in the extension of the initial space-
time by auxiliary odd/even coordinates which
equip a system with spinning degrees of free-
dom. there is another, less developed approach,
where the spinning particle systems are described
by the lagrangians, which are formulated in the
initial space-time, but depend on higher deriva-
tives. the aesthetically attractive point of the
latter approach is that spinning degrees of free-
dom are encoded in the geometry of trajectories.
the poincare and reparametrization invariance
require actions to be of the form

s = z l(k1, ...., kn )|dx|, n  d  1,

(1)

where ki denote the reparametrization invariants
(extrinsic curvatures) of curves,

ki = pdet gi+1 det gi1
where (gi )ij  (i)x(j)x, i, j = 1, . . . , i.

it was shown by m.plyushchay that a four-
dimensional system of this sort with lagrangian

physics institute, yerevan, armenia

l = ck1 describes a massless particle with the he-
licity c [1]. this model has w3 gauge symmetry
[2]:
its classical trajectories are space-like plane
curves with arbitrary rst curvature. higher-
dimensional generalization of this model is given
by the action [3]

s = cz kn |dx|, n  [(d  2)/2].

(3)

this system has the following interesting proper-
ties:

 this is the only model that leads to an
irreducible representation of the poincare
group. it describes massless particles spec-
ied by the coinciding weights of so(n )
group.

 it has n + 1 gauge degrees of freedom:
the classical solution of
is
a space-like curve specied by the rela-
tions: k1, . . . kn are arbitrary; kn +a =
kn a, k2n = 0, a = 1, . . . , n  1 (wn +2
gauge symmetry? [4]).

this model

all massive models with an action (1) corre-
spond to reducible representations of the poincare
group. nevertheless, these models can be use-
ful in planar physics, where a value of spin can
be arbitrary. extensive studies in this direc-
tion were inspired by the remarkable work of
polyakov [5] where the cp 1 model with the
chern-simons term was investigated. evaluating

for the description of null curves it is conve-

nient to use the moving frame (e, e1):

ee = ee1 = 0,

e+e = e2

1 = 1,

with the vector product  dened as follows

e+  e = e1,

e  e1 = e.

(8)

(9)

in this notation pseudoarch-length d  du and
the torsion k are dened via the frenet equations
[8]:

x = e+,

e
+ = e1,

e
1 = ke+ + e,

e
 = ke1,

where   d/d .
hence,

 =  e+e1,

2k = e

2. hamiltonian formulation

prior giving the hamiltonian formulation of the
system (7), let us present, for completeness, the
hamiltonian system describing (6) [9].

the system (6) is described by the hamiltonian

structure

 = dp  dx + cde+  de1,

h = 

2c (cid:2)c2e2

1 + (pe+  2c)2 + p2e2
+(cid:3)

and the constraints

(cid:26) e2

1 + 1  0,

e2
+  0,

e1e+  0,

pe+  c  0, pe1  0.

its lorentz generator is of the form

(12)

(13)

(14)

the eective action for the charged solitonic exci-
tation he found that it is of the type (1), where
l = m0 + c2
k2. later it was shown [6] that
m0
though the trajectories of the system are time-
like, it has not only massive, but also tachionic
and massless sectors, with mass and spin related
by the majorana condition
spin  mass = c2,

(4)

while |mass|  m0.

adding, to the initial lagrangian, the term pro-
portional to k1 modies the spin-mass relation
but preserves the basic properties of the initial
model [7].

in a (2 + 1)-dimensional space one can consider
actions of another sort dened on the light-like
(or null) curves

s = z l(k)d,

d = |x|1/2du,

x2 = 0,

(5)

where k = |d3x/d3|2 is the torsion for light-like
curves.

in ref. [9], the simplest system of this sort was

considered given by the action

s = 2cz d.

(6)

it was found that it describes the anyons with
majorana-like spectrum (4), while its classical so-
lutions are null-helices.

in the present paper, we consider a more
complicated three-dimensional system, associated
with null-curves

s = 2cz ( + k)d.

(7)

j = p  x + ce+,

where  is a constant, and k is the torsion of a
null-curve.

we show that this system has a much reacher
structure than the previous one and is related
with nonrelativistic mechanics

d  dq,

2 + q3  2q2 +

ms
c2 q +

m2
c2 = 0,

where m and s denote the mass and spin of the
system, while q =   k/c.

we conclude the introduction with some basic
facts from the geometry of three-dimensional null-
curves to be used in this paper.

from which the relation (4) follows immediately.
introducing

k = p2/2c2,

e = p/c + ke+,

(15)

we reduce the equations of motion to the frenet
formulae, while the eective coordinate reads

x  x 

c
p2

p+ :

x = 0.

thus, massive (tachionic) solutions of (6) corre-
spond to the light-like helices with negative (posi-
tive) torsion.

now let us give the hamiltonian formulation
of (7). taking into account the frenet equations
(10), we can replace the initial lagrangian de-
pending on third derivatives by the classically
equivalent one depending on rst derivatives only

while the lorentz generator is of the form

j = p  x + p+  e+ + p1  e1 =

= p  x + c(2  q)e+  2ce.

3

(24)

hence, the poincare invariants (casimirs) read

l = h2c + ce2

1 + p(x  e+)+

(16)

p2/c2 = 2qx  2,

pj/c2 = (2  q)q  2x.

(25)

+p+(e

+  e1) pi,j dij (eiej  ij)i ,

where x, p, p+, ei, dij ,  are independent vari-
ables, i, j = +, 1; ++ = 1+ = 0, 11 = 1.

the momentum conjugate to e1 reads

p1 =

l
 e1

= 2ce

1.

thus, we get the primary constraints

p1e+  2c  0, p1e1  0.

performing the legendre transformation, after
some work, we obtain the following hamiltonian
system:

therefore, the system under consideration has in-
ternal degrees of freedom, so that dierent classi-
cal solutions have the same mass and spin.

let us reduce the hamiltonian system, substi-
tuting (21) and (22) into (17)-(20). the resulting
symplectic one-form reads

a = pd(x +

2e1
q

) +

2cd

q

+

pj
cq

e+de1,

(26)

while the lorentz generator is of the form

j = p  (x +

2e1
q

) +

pj
cq

e+  e1.

(27)

now it is convenient to x the mass m and spin

 = dp  dx + dp+  de+ + dp1  de1

h = h0 + 1 +pi,j=+,1 dijuiji

with constraints

0 = p1

2/4c + pe+ + p+e1  2c  0;
1 = p1e+  2c  0,

2 = p1e1  0,
3 = p+e+  0,
uij = eiej  ij ,




and the expessions for the lagrangian multipliers:

(17)

s of the system imposing

p2 = m2, pj = ms,

(28)

and to introduce, instead of e+, e1, the new vari-
ables

(18)

e1 = e1 +

e+

q

, e2 =

cq



p
m

,

(29)

which obey the conditions

pea = 0, eaeb = ab, a = 1, 2.

(30)

2c = p+e1  pe+.

(19)

then, introducing the complex coordinate

2d11 = pe+  p2

1/2c,

let us introduce

e 

p1
2c

+

1
2c

(pe+ + p+e1  2c)e+,

(20)

which forms, together with e+, e1, the moving
frame.

thus, p and p+ are decomposed as follows

p+ = y+e+  y1e1,

p/c = qe + xe+  e1,

(21)

(22)

the equations of motion for x, e, e1 coincide
with (10), if we identify

z = e1 + ie2,

(31)

one can represent the constraints in the conven-
tional form

z2 = 0,

zz + 1 = 0, pz = 0.

(32)

in these terms, the symplectic structure is of the
form

red = dp  dx + isdz  dz +

2cd  dq

q2

,

(33)

while the lorentz generator reads

k =   pe+/c    q,

(23)

j = p  x + isz  z,

(34)

4

where we introduced the eective coordinate

x = x +(cid:18) 2

q

+

s

m(cid:19) e1 +

s
mq

e+.

(35)

in the simplest case  = 0, the
for example,
ground state is tachionic, while the mass and
spin are related as follows

one may resolve the constraints (32) by noticing
that the rst two of them imply that z may be
written in terms of a single complex parameter 
as

(36)



z =

(  ) (cid:0)1 + 2, 1  2, 2(cid:1) .

from the remaining constraint pz = 0 it follows
that

 =

ip2  m
p0 + p1

.

(37)

so, one can nally write the symplectic structure
and lorentz generator j solely in terms of x, p
and q, . it is easy to see that the reduced sym-
plectic structure reads

dp  dx  s

(p  dp)  dp

2m3

+

2cd  dq

q2

.

(38)

the rst two terms in (38) dene the symplec-
tic structure of the standard minimal covariant
model for anyons [10], from which follows that
the spin s is not quantized.

to analyze the nonrelativistic part of the sys-
tem, one can reduce it by p, and get the one- di-
mensional nonrelativistic mechanics with a cubic
potential

  dq,

2 + q3  2q2 +

ms
c2 q +

m2
c2 = 0

(39)

thus, the spectrum of the system under con-
sideration contains both massive and tachionic
branches, which have no upper/lower bounds, re-
spectively. nevertheless, this potential has a lo-
cal minimum, where the so-called semidiscrete
(semistationary) or resonance-like levels can
exist, which are responsible for numerous inter-
esting phenomena [11]. notice that the local min-
imum of this system (ground state) corresponds
to the point q = q0 dened by the equation

3q2

0  4q0 +

ms
c2 = 0,

where the mass and spin are related by the ex-
pression

.

m =

9c6 .

notice, that four-dimensional particle systems,
dened by the lagrangians linear on torsion
(third curvature), are also related with one-
dimensional non-relativistic mechanics. for ex-
ample, the symplest four- dimensional system of
this sort, formulated on non-isotropic curves, is
connected by one-dimensional conformal mechan-
ics [12].
