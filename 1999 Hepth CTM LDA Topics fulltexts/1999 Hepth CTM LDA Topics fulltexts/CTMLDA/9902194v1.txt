abstract

in this paper we present a method of deforming to rst order the
stress-tensor and the supercurrent of the superstring corresponding to
turning on ns-ns bosonic elds. furthermore we discuss the diculties
associated with turning on spacetime fermions and r-r bosons. we also
derive the gauge symmetries of the massless spacetime elds.

1. introduction.

superconformal deformations and spacetime . . .

superconformal eld theories ( with appropriate central charge ) are solutions to the
classical equations of motion of string theory. thus by studying innitesimal deformations
which preserve this superconformal structure [1], we are investigating the linearised clas-
sical equation of motion about the corresponding solution. this is an interesting problem
in its own right, but it also provides us with insights into the symmetry structure of string
theory since a spacetime symmetry transformation is a particular deformation. to study
symmetries, we seek transformations of the space-time elds that take one solution of the
classical equations of motion to another that is physically equivalent. since, solutions of
the classical equations of motion, are two-dimensional superconformal eld theories, we
are thus interested in isomorphic superconformal eld theories.

2. superconformal deformations.

we shall work in a hamiltonian formalism. any quantum mechanical theory (in-
cluding a superconformal eld theory) is dened by three elements:
i) an algebra of op-
erator valued distributions, usually called superelds, a (determined by the degrees of
freedom of the theory and their equal-time commutation relations), ii) a representation
of that algebra and iii) two distinguished elements of a, t (, ) = tf () + t () and
t (, ) = t f () + t (). superconformal operator algebras include also spin elds. in
terms of these elds the hamiltonian h and the generator of translations p are given by

h = z d(t () + t ()),

p = z d(t ()  t ()).

(1)

also the components tf () and t () must satisfy two mutually commuting copies of the
supervirasoro algebra ( we have omitted one copy of the supervirasoro for simplicity ):

[t (), t ( )] = ic
(   ) + 2it ( )(   )  it ( )(   )

the existence of the supervirasoro algebra means that the states of the theory can be
organised into modules of that algebra. if the hamiltonian, eq. (1), is bounded below,
these are highest weight representations. the highest weight states of these representations
are created by the other important operators in the theory, the superconformal primary

note that for the same a we may have many choices of hamiltonian, so that a should
more properly be associated with a deformation class of superconformal theories than with
one particular theory. the superelds do not exhaust the set of all operators in the algebra
a. on the complex plane for example the fermionic components of the superelds as two-
dimensional spinors are double-valued elds, f (e2iz) = f (z). this implies that the
operator algebra a encompasess spin elds s(z) whose presence modies the boundary
conditions of the fermionic components of the superelds. as a result the operator algebra
is not local since the ope of the fermionic component of a supereld f (z) with a spin
eld s(w) includes half integral powers of
(zw) . locality appears to be essential in
order to have a well dened string theory. we can either restrict ourselves to one of the
two boundary conditions for the fermionic components of the superelds or include both
boundary conditions (ns and r) but by eliminating half of the operators of each we regain
a local operator algebra. this will involve the projection (gso projection ) of the non-local
operator algebra a onto a local one a1.

string theory requires the full structure of the supervirasoro algebras in order to

decouple negative norm states from physical processes.

we are interested in not just one, but a family of superconformal eld theories
parametrized by the values of the spacetime elds. changing these spacetime elds changes
the superconformal eld theory but preserves the supervirasoro algebra (including the
value of the central charge). we will discuss deformations of the local operator algebra
a1 which involve a change in our choice of t, tf , t and t f in a way that preserves the
supervirasoro algebra. thus under deformations

tf ()  tf () + tf ()

and the preservation of the supervirasoro algebra, to rst order in variations, we require

superconformal deformations and spacetime . . .

[t (), t ( )] + [t (), t ( )] = 2it ( )(   )  it ( )(   )

[t (), tf ( )] + [t (), tf ( )] =

tf ( )(   )  it 

f ( )(   ).

we now seek solutions to the deformation equations. lets make the ansatz

t () = b(),

tf () = f ()

(5)

(6)

where f (b) is the fermionic (bosonic) component of a supereld of dimension (d, d).
substituting into the deformation equations and using eq. (5) we nd that our ansatz
of t and tf satisfy the deformation equations if the conformal dimension of f () is
d = d = 1
2 and the dimension of b() is d = d = 1. these are the supersymmetric
generalizations of the so called canonical deformations found in references [2].

for simplicity, consider a superconformal eld theory of free scalars and free two-

dimensional fermions, dened by the stress-tensor and the supercurrent

t () = 
tf () =

the canonical deformations which correspond to turning on a massless ns-ns eld, for
example sending a weak gravitational and two-form gauge wave through this background
can be found by identifying the bosonic component b() of eq. (6) with the appropriate
vertex operator ,

t () = b() = k  (x)xx + k  (x)x.

(8)

the right hand side of this equation is a (1, 1) primary eld only if the functions k  (x)
satisfy

k  (x) = 0,

k  (x) = 0.

(9)

its superpartner f () is then found by calculating the commutator of b() with the
supercurrent tf (). we nd that

tf () = k (x)x.

(10)

by a tedious but rather straightforward calculation we can now verify that t and tf
satisfy the deformation equations. these superconformal deformations have also been
found in papers [3].

3. spacetime symmetries.

superconformal deformations and spacetime . . .

let us recall the essential features of the approach to spacetime symmetries which
was developed in references [2], [4]. given any algebra of operators we can construct
another algebra isomorphic to the rst one by means of a similarity transformation, also
called inner automorphism h(o()) = eiho()eih or in innitesimal form h(o()) =
o() + i[h, o()]. for any innitesimal operator h then the superconformal eld theories
specied by t, tf () and t + i[h, t], tf () + i[h, tf ()] are isomorphic. thus if

t = t+  t = i[h, t]
tf = tf (+)  tf () = i[h, tf ()]

(11)

then it follows that  7  +  is a symmetry transformation of the spacetime elds. as
it should be obvious by now any inner automorphism preserves the physics but not every
automorphism can be interpreted as a change in the spacetime elds. we should then
think of eq. (11) as a restriction on the operators h.

we now know how the stress-tensor t and the supercurrent tf deform as we change
the spacetime elds, eq. (6). we then must nd operators h that when commuted with
2 , 0) and (0, 1
t and tf yield eq. (11). let () be a sum of superelds of dimension ( 1
2 )
and h to be

h = z ddd(, , ).

(12)

it then follows from the denition of superprimary elds that i[h, t ] and i[h, tf ] reproduces
a t and tf of the form of a canonical deformation eq. (6) and thus can be interpeted
as change in the spacetime elds. the obvious choice for the operator h is

h = z d d()d = z d ((x)x + (x) ) (),

(13)

where  =  + x  and d is the covariant derivative. this is the supersymmetric gen-
eralization of the operator that generates coordinate and two form gauge transformations
about at spacetime in the bosonic string theory. the integrand is only superprimary and
of dimension 1

2 if the parameter  satises

(x) = 0,

(x) = 0.

(14)

these conditions are required because of normal ordering. we then proceed to calculate
the commutator of h with t and tf and we nd

i[h, t ()] = xx + x

i[h, tf ()] =

1

x.

(15)

the result provides us with the transformation properties of the physical elds under
coordinate and two form gauge transformations

k  = .

(16)

it is not hard to generalize this construction to an innite class of innitesimal gauge
symmetries [5] and to nite symmetry transformations (t-duality) [6]. it is also worth
noting that this approach treats on equal footing exact and spontaneously broken spacetime
symmetries [7].

canonical deformations have a number of interesting features: superprimary elds of
dimension ( 1
2 ) are in natural correspondence with the physical states of string theory,
being the vertex operators. as such they have a nice spacetime interpretation in terms of
turning on spacetime elds. appealing though they are canonical deformations have also
signicant drawbacks. they correspond to turning on ns-ns elds in a particular gauge
as we have seen while they do not appear to describe spacetime fermions and r-r bosonic
elds which are described in terms of spin elds. spin elds cannot be written as super-
elds. these string backgrounds have attracted interest recently due to the conjectured
ads/cft equivalence [8]. we might attempt to identify the bosonic component b() of
the canonical deformation with the appropriate spacetime fermionic vertex operator

t () = b() = 

(x)se



2 x 

this is a (1, 1) primary eld only if the functions 

(x) obey



(x) = 0,



 (x) = 0,



(x) = 0.

(17)

(18)

in order then to nd its superpartner we need to calculate the commutator of b() with
the supercurrent tf (). the commutator of the vertex operator which is written in terms
of spin elds with the supercurrent tf is not well-dened since the corresponding ope in
the complex plane involves branch cut singularities

this suggests then that the deformations we have just constructed in terms of superelds
are not the most general solution to the deformation equations. in a forthcoming publica-
tion we intend to present the resolution to these problems.
