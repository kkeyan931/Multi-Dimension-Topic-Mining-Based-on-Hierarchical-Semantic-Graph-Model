we study discrete uxes in brane constructions of qcd-like theories.

it is shown

that when these theories are compactied on a torus, a periodic potential is generated

for the neveu-schwarz two-form modulus b. the minima of this potential are given by
b = 2 m
n , where m is the t hooft ux and n is the rank of the gauge group. the
underlying reason for this potential is the existence of a mass gap. in this case one is not

allowed a continuous range for b corresponding to non-commutative deformations of the

torus. we show that b behaves like the two form modulus of the qcd string, as well as the

iia string. this equivalence has been conjectured previously based on properties of large
n qcd suggesting a t-duality invariance. finally we show that the relation b = 2 m
n
permits fractional d0-brane charge without violating dirac quantization in the presence

of a d6-brane.

introduction

recently, an improved understanding of the infrared properties of qcd has been

gained by studying classical congurations of m theory. in [1][2][3], a theory in the same

universality class as four dimensional n = 1 qcd, known as mqcd, was studied by

wrapping an m theory vebrane on a holomorphic two-cycle  embedded in the spacetime
r10  s1. n = 0 mqcd was also constructed in [1] by taking  to be a calibrated but

non-holomorphic two-cycle. the results of this paper are applicable to either case. we will
further compactify the theory on a torus, so that the m-vebrane wraps the cycle   t 2
embedded in r8  t 2  s1. we shall not make use of the ads/cft correspondence

here[4][5][6][7]. the supergravity quantities corresponding to discrete yang-mills uxes in

the ads/cft approach were found in [8]. in the absence of fundamental matter, su (n )

qcd on a two-torus has a discrete magnetic ux m which is dened modulo n [9]. we will

show that the magnetic ux corresponds to a background m-theory three-form through

the relation

zt 3

c = 2

m
n

.

(1.1)

since this result is independent of the radius of the s1, we expect it to persist in the iia

limit, giving

b = zt 2

bn s = 2

m
n

.

(1.2)

the existence of such discrete vacua is peculiar to the case in which there is a mass gap.

in this case a periodic potential is generated for r c. if one were to consider a two-cycle

giving n = 2 super yang-mills instead, then all values of bn s would be allowed, and

would label a continuous class of theories on non-commutative tori [10][11].

we will also argue that 2 m

n behaves like a two form modulus of the qcd string as
well as the iia string. this means that the imaginary part of the action of an mqcd

string wrapping the two-torus n times is given by nrt 3 c. again, we expect this result to
persist in the iia limit, so that the imaginary part of the action of a wrapped qcd string
is given by 2n m

n . such a relation has been shown explicitly in two dimensions in the large
n limit [12][13][14]. it was also conjectured to be true in four dimensions on the basis of

properties of large n qcd suggesting a t-duality invariance. such a duality would map,

an argument due to t hooft states that in an electrically conning su (n )/zn theory

with a mass gap, magnetic uxes must be light [9]. more precisely, the energy of a magnetic

ux must vanish exponentially with the area of the torus. this is simply realized in the

m-theory construction. because of (1.1), the t hooft ux is not the central charge for

a membrane. in fact, when there is a mass gap, dierent magnetic uxes correspond to

classically degenerate m-vebrane congurations. this result diers drastically from what

one would obtain by considering a compactication of the m-vebrane giving pure n = 2

super yang-mills theory. in that case the magnetic ux is related to an additive central

charge, rather than an element of zn labeling degenerate congurations.

in the iia limit, the m-vebrane becomes a conguration of n d4-branes suspended

between ns vebranes. for congurations giving n = 2 super yang-mills on a commuta-

tive torus, the d4-brane worldvolume may also contain integral numbers of fundamental

strings, d2 branes and d0 branes [15]. however for congurations corresponding to qcd,

there are actually no d2 branes or fundamental strings in the low energy theory. this

reects the fact that both the magnetic and electric uxes in qcd are elements of zn

rather than additive central charges. however there may be euclidean d0-branes with

fractional charge. the relevance of such fractional charges to connement and dynamical

generation of superpotentials was discussed in [16]. when the theory is fully compactied
on   t 4, the d0 brane charge has a fractional part of the form 1
n m  m. this naively
appears to violate dirac quantization in the presence of a single d6 brane. however, due
to the nonzero b = 2 m
n , additional charges are induced on the d6-brane which preserve

the dirac quantization condition.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in section ii we briey review the construc-

tion of four dimensional gauge theories by wrapping m-vebranes on calibrated two-cycles.

in section iii we perform an additional compactication on a two-torus, allowing a three

form modulus in m-theory. for theories with a mass gap, we show how a non-perturbative

potential is generated for the three-form modulus. we show the equivalence of the three-

form expectation value with the t hooft ux and a two-form modulus of the qcd string.

in section v we discuss the unusual d-brane charges allowed for theories in the universality

class of qcd.

2

2. m-vebranes and qcd

a variety of four dimensional yang-mills theories may be obtained by wrapping an m
vebrane on calibrated two cycles embedded in s1r10[17][1]. here we consider two-cycles

corresponding to an su(n) yang-mills theory with a mass gap. for instance a theory in

the same universality class as pure n = 1 su (n ) yang-mills is obtained by wrapping

the ve-brane on a particular holomorphic curve embedded in three complex dimensions.

for details of this curve, the reader is referred to [1][3][2]. this theory becomes exactly
n = 1, su (n ) yang mills in the weakly coupled iia limit in which the radius of the s1

goes to zero in eleven dimensional planck units. while taking this limit, the parameters

of the curve are adjusted to keep the qcd scale xed. at the same time one takes the
limit qcdl11
is the eleven dimensional planck length. we will begin by
studying the m theory limit in which the s1 radius is large. however the quantities which

p  0 where l11
p

we will compute are discrete and independent of the radius. for our purposes the degree of

supersymmetry is unimportant so long as there is a mass gap. our results are be equally

applicable to the theory in the same universality class as pure n = 0 qcd [1] which is

obtained from a non-holomorphic but minimal area two cycle.

we will make use of two essential properties of two-cycles  corresponding to su (n )

yang-mills theories with a mass gap. the rst property is that h1(, z) is generated by a
cycle s1 wrapping the s1 of space-time n times [1][3]. the second property is that there

are no square integrable harmonic one-forms on . a compactication of  obtained by

adding points at innity gives a curve of genus zero [1]. because of the latter property,

there are no light states after dimensional reduction. at low energies, the only solution of

the equations of motion for the self dual three-form eld strength of the m5-brane is

t (3) = db(2)  c(3)|m 5 = 0,

(2.1)

where b(2) is the two-form gauge potential of the m-vebrane, and c(3)|m 5 is the pullback
of the bulk three-form potential to the m-vebrane. note that if we instead considered a

curve  giving n = 2 super yang-mills theory, then there would be normalizable harmonic

one forms associated with massless u (1) vector multiplets in the low energy theory [17].

if the m-vebrane has a homologically non-trivial three cycle there may be several vacua
corresponding to solutions of this equation. we assume that the background c(3) is at;
dc(3) = 0. we will shortly see that these vacua are discrete.

3

3. compactication on tori and three-form moduli

let us now compactify m theory on s1  t 2  r8, and wrap an m-vebrane on
  t 2  r2. the low energy theory is an su(n) yang-mills theory on t 2  r2 with a
mass gap. the m-vebrane worldvolume now has non-trivial three cycle s1  t 2. since
the m5 brane theory contains strings coupling to b(2), there is a ux quantization condition

zs1t 2

db(2) = 2m,

where m is an integer. then because t (3) = 0,

zs1t 2

c(3)|m 5 = 2m.

since s1 wraps n times around s1, the bulk three-form modulus is given by

zs1t 2

c(3) = 2

gs
permit one to freely vary the three-form modulus, which in an n = 2 brane construction

. this potential does not

would lead to a non commutative deformation of the torus.

we will now show that the the integer m is the t hooft ux (although it is hard to see

what else it could be.) to do so we will work in the iia limit. in this limit the m5-brane

becomes a set of n coincident d4-branes stretched between ns5-branes. in the absence of

the n s5-branes, the low energy theory would have a u (n ) gauge group. however in our

case there is a mass gap, and the theory is su (n ). the u (1) degree of freedom is frozen:
1
n trf  bn s = 0. this follows from dimensional reduction of t (3) = 0. if the d4-brane is
compactied on a torus, then elds on the torus are periodic up to gauge transformations
u 1 and u 2. these gauge transformations are subject to a consistency condition [18],

u 1(x1, x2)u 2(x1 + 2r1, x2)u 1(x1 + 2r1, x2 + 2r2)u 2(x1, x2 + 2r2) = i,

(3.4)

this condition permits the existence of fundamental matter, which appears when strings

end on the d4 branes. note that (3.1) follows from an analogous condition. the u s may

4

be broken up into a u (1) factor and an su (n ) factor, so that the consistency condition

becomes

eirt 2

1

n t rf e2i m

n = i,

(3.5)

where m is the su (n ) t hooft ux. since 1
n trf = bn s, we nd the t hooft ux is
precisely the discrete quantum number discovered in the m-theory approach. the fact

that the t hooft ux is only dened modulo n is reected in the fact that 2 shifts in

r bn s are gauge transformations. thus the t hooft uxes are associated with degenerate
classical vacua of the m5-brane, all of which have t (3) = 0. this is precisely what one

expects for for an electrically conning theory with a mass gap [9].

it has long been suspected that large n qcd is a string theory. we now wish to prove

the conjecture [13][14] that the t hooft ux is the real part of a two-form modulus of the

qcd-string. to do so we will show that the euclidean action of a qcd string wrapping
t 2 n times has an imaginary part given by 2n m
n let us rst compute the imaginary part
of the action of a wrapped mqcd string. the mqcd string [1] is an open membrane

ending on the m5-brane. the worlvolume of the mqcd string is i  m, where m is the

world sheet of the qcd string and i is an open interval generating the relative homology

h1(y /, zn ). y is the space in which  is embedded. for a detailed discussion of the
mqcd string, the reader is referred to [1][2]. the action of the open m-twobrane has an

imaginary piece:

ims = zim

c(3)|m 2 zim

b(2),

(3.6)

where c(3)|m 2 is the pullback of the bulk three-form to the membrane, and b(2) is the two-
form of the m-vebrane world volume. the second term is necessary for gauge invariance
of the open membrane action. under c(3)  c(3) + d(2), b(2) transforms to cancel the the
non-invariance due to the boundary: b(2)  b(2) + (2)|m 2. because db(2)  c(3)|m 5 = 0,
we may rewrite (3.6) as

ims = z(i)m

c(3),

(3.7)

where  is a chain in the m5-brane with boundary i m. the mqcd string is homotopic
to the iia string, which is a membrane with the world volume s1  m [1]. therefore the

above expression becomes

so if m wraps t 2 n times,

ims = zs1m

c(3).

ims = 2n

.

in the large n limit 2m

in the iia limit assuming the absence of a phase transition.

becomes continuous, and behaves as the two-form modulus for the qcd-string, as well as

the iia string.

4. d-brane charges in theories with a mass gap

the allowed d-brane charges in theories with a mass gap dier substantially from

those without a mass gap. if we had considered a brane construction of an n = 2 theory

instead, the d2 brane charge and the fundamental string charge would equal the magnetic

and electric uxes respectively. however the uxes in qcd are very dierent objects. the

term in the m5-brane action of the form s = r c(3)  db(2) vanishes in mqcd because

db(2)  c(3) = 0. due to the self duality of db(2)  c(3) = 0, this term becomes

s = z c(3)

rr  t r(f  b) +z bn s  t r(f  b),

(4.1)

in the iia limit. this vanishes, so there are no states in the low energy theory carrying

either d2 brane or fundamental string charge.

the constraint t r(f  b) = 0 arising from the existence of a mass gap means that

r b can not be freely adjusted. this is not the case in, for example, a brane construction

of n = 2 super yang-mills theory. in this case the adjustable ux of b is related to a

non-commutative deformation of the torus [10][11]. in [19][20][21] the quantity t r(f  b)

was argued to be a local measure of of non-commutativity on the brane worldvolume.

note that in the n   limit of a brane construction of yang-mills theory with a mass

gap, one is also allowed a continuous range of values for b. however this does not require

non-commutative deformations of the torus.

in brane constructions of qcd, the euclidean d0-brane charge may be fractional.

the importance of such fractional charges for connement and dynamical generation of

superpotentials has been discussed in [16]. we will show that the such fractional charges

are consistent with dirac quantization in the presence of a d6-brane. the chern-simons

term in the d4 brane action which determines whether there is also d0-brane charge is

given by [15]

z c(1)

rr  t r [(f  b)  (f  b)]

(4.2)

6

since t r(f  b) = 0, the d0-brane charge is given by the su (n )/zn contribution to the

instanton number, which may be fractional [22]. if one compacties su (n )/zn qcd on
t 4, then the instanton number is given by

1

162 z f  f =  +

m  m

n

,

(4.3)

where  is an integer and m are the integer t hooft uxes. the fractional piece apparently
violates dirac quantization in the presence of a single d6-brane, since q6q

0 is not an
integer multiple of 2. if a d6-brane is present then the theory on the d4 brane contains

massive fundamental matter due to string stretched between the d6-brane and the d4-

brane. since fundamentals of su (n ) are charged under the zn center, it would naively

seem that t hooft ux must vanish modulo n and the instanton number must be integer.

however the matter introduced by the d6-brane is in a fundamental representation of

u (n ), and a nontrivial su (n ) t hooft twist may be cancelled by a u (1) twist, as in

(3.4). the introduction of fundamental matter by a d6-brane does not prohibit non-trivial

t hooft uxes or fractional d0-brane charge.

the dirac quantization problem is resolved as follows. when the t hooft ux is

non-zero, there is also a background r b given by the relation (1.2). for non-zero r b

a d6-brane carries other d-brane charges [15]. the non-integer terms which threaten to

violate dirac quantization turn out to cancel just as they would for a pair of dyons in the

presence of a non-zero theta parameter. suppose that the d4 brane on which the yang-

mills theory lives is extended in the directions 01234, with the directions 0123 compactied
on t 4. the d4-brane is bounded by ns-5 branes at xed values of x4. consider the action
of a d6-brane with the world-volume t 4  s3, where s3 is embedded in the directions
56789. also, suppose that the d6-brane is at a value of x4 between the ns5-branes and

does not intersect the d4-d0 system. the path integral for the d6 brane contains a term

i(cid:16)rt 4s3

e

c(7)

rr bb

42 rs3

c(3)

rr(cid:17),

(4.4)

the second term reects the fact that in the presence of b, a d2-brane charge is induced

on the d6-brane. a d4-brane charge is induced as well, however the corresponding term

in the action does not eect dirac quantization. this is because the the d4-brane is hodge

dual to a d2-brane, and the d2-brane charge vanishes on the d4-brane associated with the

7

yang-mills theory. because of the d4-d0 system, the ramond-ramond potentials c(7)
and c(3)

rr are not globally dened. for (4.4) to be well dened, one must have

rr

i(cid:16)rt 4s4

e

dc(7)

rr  bb

42 rs4

dc(3)

rr(cid:17) = 1,

(4.5)

where s4 is embedded in the directions 56789 and surrounds the d4-d0 system, which
is a point in 56789. r dc(7) is simply the d0-brane charge, with fractional piece mm
n .
similarly r dc(3) is the d4-brane charge, or n. since b = 2 m
n , equation (4.5) is satised.

roughly speaking, we have found that

q(0)  q(6) + q(2)  q(4)  q(4)  q(2) = 2l,

(4.6)

where the q charges are associated with the d6-brane, and the q charges are associated

with the d4-branes.
