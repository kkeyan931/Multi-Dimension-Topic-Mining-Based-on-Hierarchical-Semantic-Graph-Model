finite temperature qed: non-cancellation of infrared
divergencies and thermal corrections to the electron

abstract

in this work quantum electrodynamics at t > 0 is considered. for this purpose we
use thermo eld dynamics and the causal approach to quantum eld theory according
to epstein and glaser, the latter being a rigorous method to avoid the well-known
ultraviolet divergencies of quantum eld theory. it will be shown that the theory is
infrared divergent if the usual scattering states are used. the same is true if we use more
general mixed states. this is in contradiction to the results established in the literature,
and we will point out why these earlier approaches fail to describe the infrared behaviour
correctly. we also calculate the thermal corrections to the electron magnetic moment
in the low temperature approximation kbt  me . this is done by investigating the
scattering of an electron on a c-number potential in third order in the limit of small
momentum transfer p  q. we reproduce one of the dierent results reported up to
now in literature. in the low temperature approximation infrared niteness is recovered
in a very straightforward way: in contrast to the literature we do not have to introduce
a thermal dirac equation or thermal spinors.

introduction

in this work we are concerned with quantum electrodynamics (qed) at nite temperatures.
the main result is that this theory is infrared (ir) divergent already in the cross sections
to fourth order, a result in contradiction to the literature where calculations are carried out
for all temperatures ([1], [2], [3] and [4] - [9]). at the end of sec. 3.4.4 we give a detailed
review of the literature and point out where the shortcomings lie in those calculations.

results found in the literature (e.g. [10]), but in a much more straightforward way.

if we restrict ourselves to small temperatures kbt  me we reproduce the ir-nite
we also present a rigorous discussion of the thermal corrections to the magnetic moment
of the electron in this low temperature approximation and reproduce the value of [14]. after
having pointed out these results we now present some introductory remarks on the methods
that will be applied.

for the eld theoretic aspect of qed at nite temperatures we utilize the causal approach
to quantum eld theory (qft) because this provides us with a framework which is free of
ultraviolet (uv) divergencies and allows a stringent investigation of the ir-behaviour ([21],
[22]). we will present an introduction to this theory in sec. 2.1 where we will especially
emphasize how the uv-divergencies and subsequent regularization and renormalization are
avoided by carefully treating the involved mathematical objects as what they are, i.e. dis-
tributions and not functions: the origin of the uv-divergencies in the standard framework
lies in ill-dened products of distributions.

in addition, the use of the causal method avoids the so-called pinched singularities which
arise through products of -distributions. they stem from the feynman-rules using thermal
propagators. the causal method avoids such ill-dened products by construction.

to include nite temperature we use the ideas of thermo eld dynamics (tfd). the

basics of this theory ([23], [24], [25]) will be presented in sec. 2.2.

in sec. 3 we calculate all second order and some third order graphs we will need to
investigate the ir-behaviour. the second order self energy contribution will be used to
discuss the thermal corrections to the electron mass. there we reproduce the results of
the literature ([10], [14], etc.). the vertex graph will be the basis for our calculation of the
corrections to the magnetic moment e of the electron. these corrections are unfortunately
too small to be tested by current experimental techniques. the only experiments we are
aware of that perhaps could detect nite temperature eld theoretic eects in the not too
distant future are measurements of the casimir force (see [26], [27] and references therein)
and of energy level shifts in highly excitated atoms (rydberg states), see [28] (and more
recent work on this topic).

finally we present all terms that have to be considered for the ir-behaviour of the theory
in the adiabatic limit (which will be explained in sec. 2.1.1) and investigate if their divergent
parts cancel or not. this is done in sec. 3.4.1 and 3.4.2 with the before-mentioned result.

a short discussion of this result and the relation to the literature can be found in sec.
3.4.4. to conclude, we present some ideas that possibly could help to formulate an ir-nite
thermal theory in sec. 4.

throughout this paper we use units with  = 1 = c if not mentioned otherwise and de-
ne the fourier transform as follows:

f (p) :=

1

(2)2z d4xf (x)eipx.

(1.1)

to keep this in mind is important for the correct factors (2). a remark on the notation:
we often simplify the notation by the denition m := me and thus write for the electron
mass either me or just m.

2 quantum field theory at finite temperatures

in this section we will present the formalism we are going to use to do qft at nite
temperatures. for the eld theoretic aspect we utilize the so-called causal approach to
qft. to incorporate the temperature we make use of tfd. both these formalisms will be
introduced and explained in the following.

2.1 the causal approach to qft

the traditional formalism of qft is plagued with the well-known uv-divergencies one
copes with by various regularization- and renormalization-procedures. the reason for these
divergencies lies basically in the fact that one performs mathematically ill-dened operations
by using feynman rules or performing the usual time-ordering procedure that leads to them,
respectively. there distributions (feynman propagators or -functions and products of eld
operators, resp.) are multiplied as if they were ordinary functions, a procedure, which is in
general not dened. this entails the appearance of the above-mentioned divergencies, which
one has to get rid of by regularization and renormalization of physical parameters to extract
useful information from the theory.

instead of causing divergencies by wrong manipulations and having to cope with them
afterwards, a better strategy is to avoid them from the very beginning, carefully paying
attention to the mathematics that underlies the theory.

this has been done by epstein and glaser in the early seventies [21] and then further

developed by scharf et al. [22].

this so-called causal (since causality plays a crucial role in the formalism we will soon
present) or nite (because there do not arise any uv-divergencies) qft is a perturbative s-
matrix theory. using some basic physical assumptions as causality and poincare-invariance
the s-matrix is constructed inductively order by order. in order to do that the basic elds
of the theory (described by well-dened free elds on fock-space), their (anti-)commutation
relations and how they couple in rst order (which corresponds to the interaction lagrangian
in the standard formalism) have to be known. these free elds and the s-matrix are
operator-valued distributions. to extract physical information the relevant objects (e.g. s-
matrix elements) have to be smeared out with test functions g, suitably falling o at innity
(e.g.1 g  s(m)). these test functions cut o the long range part of the interactions. to
end up with physically meaningful results the so called adiabatic limit g  1, which restores
the total interaction has to be considered. this limit may not exist (since 1 / s(m)).
if g  s(m), s(g) is well dened and free of uv- or ir-divergencies. the latter can
show up in the limit g  1, e.g.
in qed (because of the massless photon, which implies
a long-range interaction like the coulomb-potential) for s-matrix elements. but even there
(in qed at zero temperature) the adiabatic limit exists if the right physically measurable
quantities (inclusive cross sections) are considered, making qed at t = 0 a physically
meaningful theory (in the cross sections at least up to fourth order - up to this level the
existence and uniqueness of the adiabatic limit has been proven, see [22]).

this last remark alludes to another aspect of the causal approach. one has to be modest;
many results known in the standard theory are not yet rigorously veried. for example, it is
dicult to prove non-perturbative statements. likewise a rigorous proof of the cancellation
of ir-singularities to all orders `a la grammar-yennie [29] is not yet known - to mention just
two things. on the other side, by calculating on sound mathematical grounds one always
knows exactly what is going on - and there is no other possibility to achieve this knowledge.

1 m denotes the minkowski space, i.e. the manifold r4 furnished with the lorentz scalar product based

on the metric tensor g = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).

2.1.1 the causal construction of the s-matrix

here we want to present the causal formalism. for more details than we give here we refer
the reader to [22], [30] and [31].

in quantum mechanical scattering theory the s-matrix can be written under certain
assumptions as a time-ordered exponential of the interaction lagrangian (cf. e.g. sec. 0.3.
in [22]). this and the work of stuckelberg and bogoljubov, shirkov2 motivated epstein
and glaser to start in eld theory with the following formal 3 power series in the coupling
constant:

s(g) = 1 +

1

n!z d4x1...d4xntn(x1, ..., xn)g(x1)...g(xn).

(2.1)

xn=1

we cannot make any statement about the convergence of this series - that is a main content
of the expression formal. but every tn will turn out to be a well dened operator-valued
distribution. after smearing it out with the test function g  s(m), it is a well dened
operator on fock-space 4. from the construction we will describe in the following, it is clear
that tn is of the form

tn(x1, ..., xn) =xk

tk
n(x1  xn, ..., xn1  xn) : ok(x1, ..., xn) :,

(2.2)

where : ok : is a normally ordered product of free eld operators (a wick monomial), and
the numerical5 distribution tk
n depends only on relative coordinates as a consequence of
translation invariance.

the so-called n-point distributions or n-point functions tn will be constructed inductively
order by order from t1 which has to be known from the beginning and is given as a wick-
ordered product of free elds on fock-space6, i.e. expressed by well-dened objects only.

in standard eld theory tn would be constructed as follows:

tn(x1, ..., xn) = t(cid:8)t1(x1)...t1(xn)(cid:9)

(x0

(1)  x0

(2))  ...  (x0

:=x

(n1)  x0

(n))t1(x(1))  ...  t1(x(n)),

(2.3)

where t denotes the time-ordering operator, t1 the usual interaction lagrangian and the
sum runs over all n! permutations  of the n variables x1, ..., xn. this leads to the above-
mentioned uv-divergencies; the reason is that the time-ordering by multiplication with
-functions and subsequently the feynman rules are usually not well dened procedures.
the causal construction, which we will present now, is essentially a method to do this
time-ordering in a well-dened way.

the expansion of the s-matrix in (2.1) can be formally inverted7:

s(g)1 = 1 +

1

n!z d4x1...d4xn


t n(x1, ..., xn)g(x1)...g(xn).

(2.4)

xn=1

2for a short historical introduction and references we refer to the introductory remarks in [22].
3throughout this paper we use the notation formal to denote innite series without having control of

convergence, which nevertheless can be treated in the well-dened setting of [32].

4furthermore, instead of treating the formulae to come in the context of formal power series, here it is
always possible to take the sums up to a convenient large enough but nite value m  n instead of . (2.7)
would then be used as a denition, motivated by (2.6); (2.10) etc. can then be derived by calculations with
polynomials.

5here numerical means that d contains no eld operators; but it does not mean that it is necessarily a

scalar.

6e.g. for qed at t = 0: t1(x) := ie :(x)(x): a(x).
7some remark concerning the typography: the literature on the causal method usually denotes


t n by

etn. since we already want to use the  e -symbol to denote a dierent object in the thermal eld theory

context in agreement with the literature of this latter area, we decided to change the notation in the causal
context.

6

by denition (c.f. (2.1) and (2.4)), tn and
set of n points in m we write


t n are symmetric in x1, ...xn. for the disordered

if we write s := 1 + t , then formally

x = {xj  m | j = 1, ...n}.

s1 = (1 + t )1 = 1 +

xr=1

(t )r.

now we collect all terms of the same order in the last sum and get

(2.5)

(2.6)


t n(x) =

nxj=1

(1)jxpj

tn1(x1)...tnj (xj),

(2.7)

where the second sum runs over all partitions of x into j disjoint subsets

x = x1  ...  xj, xh 6= ,

|xh| = nh, h  {1, ..., j} .

(2.8)

we want to emphasize that the products of distributions in (2.7) are well-dened: they are
direct products of distributions, because the factors have disjoint sets of arguments.

some other relations between the tn and


t n, which for example will be used to obtain
(2.23) - (2.25), can now be derived with the help of 1 = s(g)s(g)1, (2.1), (2.4) and collection
of all terms of the same order. for that we refer the reader to [22]. the consequences of
unitarity, translation-invariance and lorentz-covariance of the s-matrix for the properties
of tn and


t n can be found there as well.

we now turn to the most important property, that is causality. consider two test func-
tions g1, g2  s(m), for which there is a space-like surface that separates their support. then
there exists a lorentz-system, in which all points of supp(g1) are earlier8 then all points of
supp(g2). in this case we write supp(g1) < supp(g2). we now require for the s-matrix

s(g1 + g2) = s(g2)s(g1) g1, g2  s(m) if supp(g1) < supp(g2).

(2.9)

combining this with (2.1) and (2.4), we get after permuting the integration variables in a
suitable way (see [22])

tn(x1, ..., xn) = tm(x1, ..., xm)tnm(xm+1, ..., xn) for {x1, ..., xm} > {xm+1, ..., xn} and

t n(x1, ..., xn) =

t nm(xm+1, ..., xn) for {x1, ..., xm} < {xm+1, ..., xn}.

(2.10)


t m(x1, ..., xm)



this property shows that the tn are time-ordered products; especially if all the arguments
xj have dierent temporal components x0
j , we can permute them to order them in time:
x0
1 > x0

n. repeated application of (2.10) then yields

2 > ... > x0

tn(x1, ..., xn) = t1(x1)  ...  t1(xn).

(2.11)

now we turn to the general inductive step to construct tn on condition that we know
all tm, 1  m  n  1, and that they have the properties mentioned above. using (2.7) we

system.

can calculate

t m, 1  m  n  1. then we dene the following distributions

an(x1, ..., xn) :=xp2
rn(x1, ..., xn) :=xp2



t n1 (x)tnn1(y, xn),

tnn1(y, xn)


t n1 (x),

where the sum runs over all partitions

p2 : {x1, ..., xn1} = x  y, x 6= ,

into two disjoint subsets with |x| = n1, |y | = n  1  n1. we also dene

dn(x1, ..., xn) := rn(x1, ..., xn)  an(x1, ..., xn) .

then we dene two other distributions, just extending the sums in (2.12) and (2.13) to all
partitions p 0

2 , including the empty set x = :

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

an(x1, ..., xn) :=xp 0

2



t n1(x)tnn1(y, xn)

= an(x1, ..., xn) + tn(x1, ..., xn),

rn(x1, ..., xn) :=xp 0

2

tnn1(y, xn)


t n1(x)

= rn(x1, ..., xn) + tn(x1, ..., xn).

the distributions an, rn are not known to us since they contain the unknown tn. but we
know the dierence

dn = rn  an = rn  an.

(2.18)

now we will show, and this is the crucial step of the causal construction, how rn (or an)
can be determined separately, thus making possible the construction of tn by

tn = an  an = rn  rn.

(2.19)

in order to achieve that, we investigate the support properties of dn, an and rn. this is
done in [22]. the result is the following: let

+

v

(x) := {y  m |(y  x)2  0, y0  x0}

denote the closed forward cone of x and

v (x) := {y  m |(y  x)2  0, y0  x0}

its closed backward cone. the n-dimensional generalizations are


n (x) := {(x1, ..., xn)  mn|xj  v (x)  j = 1, ..., n}.

then it can be proven inductively that n  3

supp(dn(x1, ..., xn1, xn))  
supp(rn(x1, ..., xn1, xn))  
supp(an(x1, ..., xn1, xn))  

n (xn).

n (xn)

n (xn)  
+
n (xn)

(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

therefore, we say that dn has causal support9. an and rn are called the advanced and
retarded distribution, respectively, because of their supports being located in the backward
and forward light cone, respectively. it follows now from the equations (2.23), (2.24) and
(2.25) that an or rn and therefore tn (with (2.19)) can be constructed if one knows dn
and has split it into two parts according to these support properties.

because of the special role of xn in this procedure, tn as calculated in (2.19) in general

has to be symmetrizised with respect to the arguments.

this splitting is the crucial point in the whole causal construction, and we will see that
it has to be done very carefully and that just multiplying by -functions, which would be
the most direct method, will in general fail. it is exactly this splitting-procedure that causes
the uv-divergencies if done wrongly. we will present the splitting, its problems and how it
is done correctly right after some other remarks.

up to now we described the general inductive step from n1 to n. to start the induction
we have to know t1, to construct d2 according to (2.15) and to prove explicitly that d2 has
causal support. then d2 has to be split into r2 and a2 according to the causal support
properties. after that t2 is constructed using (2.19).

since we will have to perform the adiabatic limit g  1 explicitly in our calculations, we
present here how it is carried out in the most suitable way: we choose a xed test function
g0  s(m) with g0(0) = 1 and consider the limit

this so-called scaling limit describes a method to perform the adiabatic limit g  1 explic-
itly. then we have in momentum space10

g(x) := g0(x), with   0.

(2.26)

g(k) =

g(k) = lim

proof: this is a distributional equation. therefore we consider g  s(m) as a regular distri-

bution g  s(m). then we have   s(m)

lim
g1hg, i = lim

g1hg, i = lim

here we used the theorem of lebesgue in the fourth step.
this leads to another useful formula:

z d4kg(k) =z d4k

1

4 g0(cid:18) k

(cid:19) =z d4k(2)2(k) = (2)2.

in explicite calculations, which we will do mostly in momentum space, this is incorporated
as follows. we are interested in expressions (e.g. a matrix element) of the form

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

where bt (k1, ..., kn) usually contains some normally ordered eld operators and numerical

distributions (cf. 2.2). using (2.27) this equals

z d4k1...d4kng(k1)...g(kn)bt (k1, ..., kn),
4nz d4k1...d4kng0(

)...g0(

kn


k1


1

)bt (k1, ..., kn).

9since supp(dn) lies in the n-dimensional generalization of the light cone with respect to xn, i.e. each

xi, 1  i  n lies in the region that can causally inuence or be inuenced by xn.
from the corresponding formula 3.11.2 in [22].

10 we caution the reader that we adopt the usual denition of the fourier transformation here, dierently

9

now we perform the transformations ki  ki for i = 1, ..., n , and get

z d4k1...d4kng0(k1)...g0(kn)bt (k1, ..., kn).

(2.32)

in this way the adiabatic limit is usually performed: the variables ki, in which the whole
expression is smeared out are replaced by ki, and the test function g is replaced by g0.
then some integrations usually have to be performed, and the limit   0 has to be taken
in the end. however, sometimes the adiabatic limit can be performed trivially in some of
the variables ki. this means that all the involved expressions are of such a structure that
 can be set zero at the very beginning11, and the remaining ki-integration leaves us with
factors (2)2 (use (2.29)). this amounts to setting the considered ki equal to zero in (2.30)

and replacing the corresponding integrationr d4kig(ki) by (2)2. this will be used in many

of the calculations in this work. another often used trick is to set the involved ki equal to
zero where this is allowed, although the adiabatic limit is not trivial in this variable. an
example is a(p  k1) with p2 = m2: this can be replaced by a(p).
2.1.2 splitting of causal distributions

as mentioned in the preceeding section the crucial step of the causal construction of the
s-matrix is the splitting12 of dn into an advanced and a retarded part.

by construction, dn has the following form (for an example see (c.3) where we calculate

d2 for qed at t > 0)

dn(x1, ..., xn) =xk

dk
n(x1  xn, ..., xn1  xn) : ok(x1, ..., xn) :,

(2.33)

where : ok : is a normally ordered product of external free eld operators (a wick monomial),
and the numerical distribution dk
n depends only on relative coordinates as a consequence of
translation invariance. it is also the numerical distribution dk
n, which contains the informa-
tion on the support properties of dn, that is, being concerned with the splitting problem,
we can forget about the operator structure.

given a tempered distribution d  s(mn = rm), m = 4n, with supp(d)  

n (0), the splitting problem can be formulated as follows:

+

n (0) 

+

is it possible to nd a pair of tempered distributions {r, a}  s(mn) with supp(r) 
n (0), supp(a)  

the answer is yes 13. this will be shown in the following.

n (0) and d = r  a ?

a remark on the uniqueness of the decomposition d = r a: assume there are two solutions
of the splitting problem {r1, a1} and {r2, a2}, d = r1  a1 = r2  a2; then the dierence
r1  r2 = a1  a2 has support {0}  mn and therefore it is of the following form:

cd(x), x  mn, d :=

1+...+4n
1 ...x4n
x1

4n

,

x||

(2.34)

where  is a multi-index and x = (x1, ..., x4n)  mn.
so the splitting problem has an ambiguity in the solution at 0 only. we will see soon
that it is exactly the behaviour of the distribution d at this point 0, which is crucial for

11mathematically this means that we can apply the theorem of lebesgue.
12a detailed discussion of this splitting can be found in [22] and [30].
13even the more general problem of decomposing a not necessarily causal distribution into two parts with

certain properties is solvable under certain assumptions; see e.g. [33].

the splitting. depending on how singular d is in this region, the splitting can simply be
done by multiplication with -functions - or not; in this latter case d has to be split more
carefully and a multiplication with  would generate divergencies.

to have a notion of how singular a causal distribution is near 0 we introduce the singular
order of a causal distribution, which is a rigorous denition of the power counting degree
of uv-divergence one knows from standars methods14.

definition: the distribution d  s(rm) has the quasi-asymptotics 15 d0  s(rm)
at x = 0 with respect to   c0([0,), [0,)) if the limit
()md(x) = d0(x) 6= 0

(2.35)

lim
0

exists in s(rm).

the equivalent denition in momentum space reads as follows:

definition: the distribution d  s(rm) has the quasi-asymptotics d0  s(rm) at
p =  with respect to   c0([0,), [0,)) if the limit

()(cid:28) d(cid:18) p

(cid:19), (p)(cid:29) =(cid:10) d0, (cid:11) 6=(cid:10)0, (cid:11)

(2.36)

lim
0

exists    s(rm).

the condition 6= 0 is necessary to have a unique denition of the term singular order as
we will see soon16. the quasi-asymptotics probes the behaviour of d and d in the vicinity
of x = 0 and p = , respectively (cf.[22]).

we derive by a scaling transformation that (cf. [22])

  r :

(a)
()

lim
0

= a a  (0,).

(2.37)

thus we call () the power-counting function and give the following

definition: the distribution d  s(rm) is said to have singular order  if it has a
quasi-asymptotics d0 at x = 0 or its fourier transform d has a quasi-asymptotics d0
at p = , respectively, with power-counting function () satisfying (2.37)17.

for examples and some remarks we refer the reader to [22] and [30].

this notion of singular order  is crucial for the splitting of the distribution d = r  a,
because it can be shown that for  < 0 the splitting can be done essentially by multiplication
with -functions and turns out to be unique18, whereas for   0 one has to proceed more
carefully and ends up with some ambiguities of the form of terms with support in {0}. now
we turn to the splitting problem more explicitly:

case 1:  < 0. in this case we have

()   for   0,

(2.38)

14an exemplary calculation, which shows how the singular order determined by sloppy power counting on

the one hand and by the rigorous procedure presented here on the other can dier, can be found in [34].

15we use the notation introduced by the authors who introduced this concept: [35].
16see footnote 17.
17if we do not require d0 6= 0 in (2.35), and the corresponding condition in (2.36), respectively, any   
could be chosen as singular order of d. an exception is  = : then d0 = 0 is possible and allowed. to
have a denition where this case is incorporated as well the singular order has to be dened as an inmum
of all the values for which the limits (2.35) and (2.36), respectively, - leaving out the condition 6= 0 - exist.
18if (r)  (d) and (a)  (d) is required .

now we choose an arbitrary but xed vector v = (v1, ..., vn)  
(4n  1)-dimensional hyperplane by

n (0). then we dene a

h splits the causal support of d: all products vjxj are either > 0 for x

this function is sort of a smooth version of a -function. now it can be shown (see [22])
that the limit

 (cid:19)d(x) =: (vx)d(x) =: r(x)

(2.42)

exists, dening the multiplication of d by a -function unambiguously19 and independent
of v. thus a solution of the splitting problem is given by

r with supp(r)  

+

n (0) and a := r  d with supp(a)  

n (0).

(2.43)

many calculations in eld theory are best done in momentum space, therefore we give a
formula in the form of a dispersion integral for r (for details and derivation: [22], [30]):

way:

19because of the claim in footnote 18; adding distributions with point-support in {0} would violate this
20some intuitive remarks concerning this integral: the factor
1ti0 is the fourier transform of a -
function and as a convolution in momentum space reects the product with  in x-space. a factor
ti0 in
momentum space is sort of integration in x-space (remember: dierentiation in x-space becomes multipli-
cation by p in momentum space; therefore a division can be seen as an integration). singular order   0
means that in momentum space d  p; if we divide this ( + 1) times by p, we get 1
p , which has  = 1
and can therefore be split trivially - thus d
p becomes convoluted with the fourier transform of . this may
give some intuitive idea of (2.46). to derive this formula corresponding considerations for the test functions,
with which d is smeared out, have to be incorporated rigorously.

here the subscript 0 refers to a special property of this solution of the splitting problem,
namely

d
p r0(p)|p=0 = 0,

||  .

(2.47)

this means that r0 is in a certain way normalized at the origin in momentum space. there-
fore this special solution r0 is called the central splitting solution with normalization point
0. there is also a formula for a more general solution with an arbitrary normalization point
q  mn, but it is not very handy.
the fact that for   0 the ambiguity (2.34) of the splitting solution cannot be removed
and remains a priori undetermined is very important. in momentum space (2.34) takes the
form of a polynomial:

cp.

x||=0

(2.48)

these terms are called normalization terms and the coecients c normalization constants;
they have to be determined by further physical conditions as lorentz covariance, pct-
invariance, gauge-invariance, etc.

for more remarks on the dispersion integrals, how analytic continuation is used to gen-
eralize (2.46) to arbitrary p  mn, which consequences the existence of perhaps innitely
many normalization constants has for a theory etc., we refer to [22] and [30].
concluding remark: in this section we have presented the basic formalism of the causal
approach to qft and pointed out the main features. the main point is that there are no
uv-divergencies in the causal approach. this is related to the splitting of causal distribu-
tions. for singular order  < 0 it can be done trivially with a unique solution, and the
results that are obtained for tn are the same as if they would be calculated using ordinary
feynman rules (if tn does not contain any subgraph with   0; an example of this is qed
in the case of tree graphs). for   0 the trivial splitting yields uv-divergencies - just as
they appear using feynman rules, whereas with a more careful procedure as described above,
we end up with uv-convergent and well dened quantities. but in this case the solution is
not unique, there remain local terms of the form (2.34) resp. (2.48) to be determined.

furthermore, the causal approach provides us with a well understood formalism to tackle
the ir-problem, which amounts to inquiring into the adiabatic limit g  1. there is no
need to introduce an unphysical photon mass or other regularization schemes. this will be
crucial in our calculations for qed at t > 0. in the literature this limit (or the equivalent
procedure in the formalism used) is usually done at the very beginning of the calculations,
whereas the correct proceeding is to do it at the end. this causes relevant dierences in the
results, as we will see later.

the causal formalism has up to now been used to investigate several theories (as qed in
[22] and [31], yang-mills in [36] - [41], the standard model in [42] - [44], quantum gravity in
[45] - [49], lower dimensional theories in [34], [50], [51], etc.) and fundamental questions (as
the ghost structure in [52], the convergence of the s-matrix in [53], the fundamental role of
gauge invariance in qft in [54] and [55], etc.). for an introduction to the theory we refer
the reader to [22],[30] and [31].

2.2 field theory at finite temperatures

in this section we make some remarks on eld theory at nite temperatures and present the
formalism we will use in our calculations.

the basic aim of thermal qft is to describe particles that are embedded in some system
that serves as a thermal background, e.g. an electron in a black body radiation background,
within a quantum eld theoretic setting. in this work we will only consider thermal qed,
i.e. photons, electrons and positrons in a black body radiation background, if temperature

13

is high enough including eects of ee+-pairs generated in the bath. we will not consider
the implication of our results for other things of great interest as the quark-gluon plasma,
etc.

there are several approaches to thermal qft. a very complete review of these methods
and their relation among each other is given in [23], where an extensive list of references up
to 1987 can be found as well.

since we want to incorporate temperature in the causal approach to qft we presented
in the foregoing section, we decided to use the ideas of tfd, the latter being an operator
formalism without path-integrals and by its structure allowing a quite straightforward com-
bination with the former21. we demand from tfd to provide us with eld operators, their
(anti-)commutators and t1 to be able to use the causal formalism. in the following we will
develop the ideas of tfd as far as we need them to achieve this goal. then we will take
this thermal t1, in our case for qed at t > 0, and start to calculate several things using
the causal method. we compare the results with standard eld theoretic calculations in
qed at t > 0 and establish several important dierences, which will be traced back to some
shortcomings in the standard calculations.

we want to emphasize that these dierences between our results and the literature do
not depend on the fact that we use the causal method. the causal method diers from
the standard calculation in the uv-region. but the problems in thermal qft arise from
the ir-behaviour, which can be treated using ordinary feynman rules with an ir-regulator,
since the involved graphs all have singular order  < 0, and graphs with ( > 0)-subgraphs
have a very transparent structure (at least the ones we are concerned with) - cf. the remark
at the end of the introduction to sec. 3. one just needs a formulation of the theory wherein
the ir-problem, say the adiabatic limit, can be treated in a rigorous and controlled manner,
which is the case in the causal method.

2.2.1 thermo field dynamics

we will present some short introduction to the ideas of tfd. this will be done in a rather
loose manner, without any proofs or considerations concerning mathematical rigor, because
we just need some basic features of tfd in an axiomatic way to build up a causal thermal
qft. all the things we will present concerning the algebraic background, etc.
just serve
to put the ideas we nally take over into some broader context. this part may be skipped
without big consequences for the understanding of the calculations to come, since we will
state the framework of our causal theory for t > 0 in a rigorous way in section 2.2.2, quite
independently of the motivating remarks that follow now. for more detailed introductions
to tfd we refer the reader to [23], [24] and [25].

a basic idea of tfd is as follows: we write the statistical mechanical expectation value
of some quantity a in the mixed state  as an expectation value on a hilbert space as in
ordinary quantum mechanics:

(a) = h|a|i.

(2.49)

more concrete: let {|ni}  h be an orthonormal basis of eigenstates of a hamiltonian on a
hilbert space h:

h|ni = en|ni, hm|ni = mn.

(2.50)

21another reason to use tfd is the fact that it seems to be extendable to describe non-shell quasi-particles
and non-equilibrium situations in a quite straightforward way ([56], [57]). in [23], sec. 2.5.6, it is shown
that tfd and other formalisms are equivalent in some aspects as for example the perturbative calculation
of thermal green functions.

(2.51)

then we have a  l(h,h)

h|a  i|i =

tr(eh a)
tr(eh )

=: hai.

(2.52)

(2.52) can be considered in an algebraic setting: compare quantum mechanics in the

standard vs. the algebraic23 formulation:

standard:

algebraic:

observable: a  l(h,h)  on a c-algebra of observables a

linear functional 

expectation value:

(a).

state:   h
h|a|i

given a c-algebra a and a state  on a, we can construct the following objects by the
so-called gns-construction (see [58]):

a representation
wherein

 of a on a hilbert space h,
  h :  is cyclic, and
(a) = h|(a)i a  a.

if we now take an equilibrium state in the standard formulation, e.g. the grand-canonical
ensemble, then we can dene a linear functional on the algebra of observables a as follows:

(a) := tr(a)  a  a with  :=

eh

tr(eh)

.

(2.53)

now we carry over the time evolution of the standard formalism to the algebraic one and
get in this way a condition on  restricting it to be an equilibrium state. this condition is
the so-called kms-condition (see [58]) and reads as follows:

(atb) = (bat+i ) with at := eith aeith .

(2.54)

a state that obeys this condition is called kms-state.

if we now carry out the gns-construction for a kms-state, we get a formalism whose
constituent objects have all the special properties necessary to apply the results of tomita
and takesaki on modular algebras (tt-theory) (see [58], [23], [24]). by that we nally
have a formalism to describe states with temperature 6= 0, which formally can be built
|i serves as the vacuum

state (the thermal vacuum), and we can dene and construct emission and absorption
operators, eld operators, propagators, etc. an important point is that the tt-theory
for the gns-construction on kms-states demands a doubling of the degrees of freedom to
correctly incorporate the time-evolution in the formalism. roughly speaking one has the
ordinary objects of the standard theory and in addition a copy of them, often referred to as

the tilde-objects (because they become marked by e) and the time evolution is given by
means of h  eh.

historically the whole story developed quite dierently. the doubling of elds in tfd
was established mostly on more or less stringent physical considerations (see e.g [25]). beside

22the doubling of degrees of freedom that shows up here by h  h will be explained later.
23see e.g. [58], [59].

15

that the doubling was necessary to get rid of certain singularities (the so-called pinched
singularities, see e.g.
[23], p.205) that showed up in the theory in two- and more loop
graphs as a consequence of products of -distributions (as we will see later, temperature is
incorporated in the feynman propagators by terms  (p2  m2) - thus ill-dened products
of s are generated using ordinary feynman rules). this doubling could also be the solution
of the problem the author of [60] sees with the existence of a perturbative thermal theory in
general. another argument for doubling the degrees of freedom is that a similar structure
shows up in some other formalisms for thermal qft.

the connection between tfd and the algebraic results mentioned above has been estab-

lished by ojima in [24].

2.2.2 tfd in the causal approach

in this subsection we will build up the formalism to incorporate temperature in the causal
qft. this will give us a fock space formalism as it is known from ordinary (t = 0)-qft,
we just will have two copies of every eld, etc., as motivated in the foregoing section.
the interpretation of the physical content of these tilde-elds is somewhat unclear and
controversial; in our opinion the calculations have to guide us in this respect. thus we will
for example see that the formalism urges us to interpret ha(~k, )+| as a nal state with
one photon of momentum ~k absorbed from the thermal vacuum - so the argument that the
tilde-objects are as unphysical as ghosts, as it is sometimes claimed in literature (e.g.
in
[61]), cannot provide us with the correct point of view. we will also see that tilde-elds can
show up in external legs of graphs. all these things will become clear in the course of our
concrete calculations in section 3. some considerations concerning the physical signicance
of the tilde-objects can be found in [25].
now we will dene our formalism for spinor qed at t > 0:

bosons: for the photons we take two copies of absorption and emission operators:

a(~k, ), a(~k, )+

and

a(~k, ), a(~k, )+,

(2.55)

which obey the commutation relations:

[a(~k, ), a(~k, )+] = (~k  ~k) = [a(~k, ), a (~k, )+], = 0 otherwise.

(2.56)

the common vacuum shall be denoted by |i: a(~k, )|i = 0 and a(~k, )|i = 0.

now we dene the eld operators:

a(x)

e|ku|1 is the bose distribution function, u  m denotes a time like normed
here f (k) :=
(i.e. uu = 1) vector 24 that describes the four-velocity of the background heat bath25
24incorporating this vector u in the theory, we establish a covariant formalism. cf. the remark at the end

of this section.

25according to the ideas of tfd as presented in sec. 2.2.1, the fock space vacuum |i may be interpreted

as a thermal equilibrium heath bath of temperature t = 1

kb .

16

(thus we have u = (1,~0) in the rest frame of the bath). furthermore, we dene  :=
1
kbt , where kb is the boltzmann constant (which can be set to 1 in suitable units) and t
denotes the temperature (as a lorentz scalar26). from  the +-sign is to be taken for
the components27  = 1, 2, 3,  for  = 0. we emphasize that in (2.57) we implicitly have
k2 = 0 and k0 = |~k|. incorporating this covariantly (2.57) reads as follows:

(2.58)

a(x) =

commutation relations are given in app. a.

fermions: as for the photons we take two copies of absorption and emission operators

for the electrons:

bs(~p, ), bs(~p, )+

and

bs(~p, ), bs(~p, )+,

and the same for the positrons:

ds(~p, ), ds(~p, )+

and

ds(~p, ), ds(~p, )+.

they shall obey the following anti-commutation relations:

{bs(~p, ), bs (~p, )+} = (~p  ~p)ss = {bs(~p, ), bs (~p, )+}, = 0 otherwise,
{ds(~p, ), ds (~p, )+} = (~p  ~p)ss = { ds(~p, ), ds(~p, )+}, = 0 otherwise.

again we dene eld operators:

where f(p) :=
e(|pu|)+1 is the fermi-dirac distribution function with chemical potential
, and u, v are the ordinary four-spinors, solution of the dirac equation, as used in the
(t = 0)-theory. the anti-commutation relations for the eld operators can be found in app.
a.

in the denition of the eld operators and in the following we adopt the viewpoint of
describing the electrons, positrons, photons and their tilde-conjugates by 6 dierent sets

26for the dierent possibilities how the temperature could transform under lorentz transformations see
[62] and references therein and recent developments in this area, respectively. for the present calculations we
adopt the most popular choice: the temperature is a lorentz scalar. we did not investigate the consequences
these other possible choices for the transformation properties of the temperature would have for thermal
qft.

27compare with the quantization of the radiation eld in [22], sec. 2.11.

17

of emission and absorption operators in the same fock space (with vacuum |i) as it is
ordinarily done in standard qed, with its three dierent particles.
here we can already see from (2.57) that the incorporation of the temperature will cause

additional ir-problems since f (k) diverges as 1
|~k|

for |~k|  0.

now we want to give some motivation for the formulae (2.57) and (2.63). in tfd the
following relations between the ordinary emission and absorption operators of the (t = 0)-
theory and the ones for t > 0 can be established:

a(~k, )+! =(cid:18)ch sh
  a(~k, )

sh ch(cid:19)  a(~k)

a(~k)+!   a(~k)

a(~k)+! =(cid:18) ch sh

ibs(~p)+(cid:19) =(cid:18)c s

c(cid:19)(cid:18) bs(~p, )

(sh)2 := f (k) and c2 := 1  f(p),

s
here (ch)2 := 1 + f (k),
ch, sh can
be written as a cosinus hyperbolicus and sinus hyperbolicus, resp., of a certain angle, c,
s as a cosinus and sinus, respectively. such transformations as in (2.64), (2.65) are called
bogoliubov transformations. for the implications of this connection between t = 0 and
t > 0, generalizations of them or further results related to them we refer the reader to the
literature (see e.g. [56], [25]). we will not consider these things here because they are of no
use to us. we just take these relations to give some more motivation for our formulation of
the thermal qft: given (2.64) and (2.65), they can be inserted into the formulae for the
eld operators at t = 0, which read as follows (see any qft book; but we adopt here the
normalization of [22], sec. 2.2 and 2.11):

s2 := f(p).

(2.66)

(2.67)

and we get (2.63) and an expression quite similar28 to (2.57). pay attention to the fact that
unlike in the (t = 0)-theory here the positive and negative frequency part, resp. (eikx)
is not anymore associated with the absorption and emission part, respectively. for the tilde
absorption and - emission operators it is just the other way round. this will evoke quite
dierent structures compared to t = 0 in some calculations.

to use the causal method we now need to know the various contractions of the thermal
eld operators (because of the wick theorem we will use) and t1 for qed at t > 0 to
start the whole procedure. beside that, we give some other useful formulae as contractions
in momentum space, causal distributions, feynman propagators and some relations among
them. all this, except for t1, which we want do discuss now, can be found in appendix a.
at the end of section 2.2.1 we mentioned and shortly motivated the doubling of the

degrees of freedom in thermal qft, especially the new hamiltonian bh := h  eh, which

28 since we want the  to be associated with the emission operator part of the eld for t > 0 as well

(cf. the argumentation in [22] sec. 2.11) we have to adjust these signs in a suitable manner.

has to be used. based on this consideration we dene t1 for qed at t > 0 as follows29:

t1(x) : = ie :(x)(x): a(x)  ie :(x) (x): a(x).

(2.68)

from this equation we see that there are two types of vertices in the theory, one with
ordinary elds, denoted by type 1, the other with tilde-elds, denoted by type 2.

a remark to avoid confusion: in our formalism of qed at t > 0 we only have thermal
objects 30. we only have the thermal absorption and emission operators from (2.55), (2.59)
and (2.60), and the eld operators built up of them as in (2.57) and (2.63). any mentioning
of (t = 0)-quantities was only done to give some motivations for our formalism. thus
we emphasize especially that any normal ordering (e.g.
in t1) is done with respect to the
absorption and emission operators from (2.55),(2.59) and (2.60), and that expectation values
have to be considered between states generated from the thermal vacuum |i.
remark: in this section we have constructed a covariant formalism for qft at t > 0,
here especially for qed. we see that covariance need not be lost in a thermal qft as often
claimed because of the preferred rest frame distinguished by the heat bath. using a covariant
formulation one usually has a better control of the calculations31. in appendix b we give
some short (not rigorous) calculations in this formalism, which may serve to strengthen the
condence in it.

we want to emphasize that dierent authors in tfd sometimes use dierent conventions,
which dier by factors i,1 etc. in the formulae, e.g. for the bogoljubov transformations.

3 cross sections to fourth order for qed at t > 0

after having set up the framework of our theory in the foregoing section, we want to calculate
all second order terms of qed at t > 0, which will allow a discussion of the thermal mass
correction (using the self energy of the electron). we also need them to calculate some third
order contributions as the vertex, which will be needed to discuss the thermal corrections
to the magnetic moment of the electron. furthermore, we will gather all contributions from
rst to third order to the cross section (for scattering of an electron on a c-number potential)
to fourth order to investigate the ir-behaviour of the theory.

the main result is that thermal qed, as it is usually formulated, is ir-divergent already
in cross sections to fourth order if it is not restricted to small temperatures kbt  me (see
sec. 3.4.2): there is no complete cancellation of ir-divergencies as it is claimed in literature
([1], [2], etc.). besides that we get a much simpler cancellation of ir-divergencies than the
one in the literature ([10], etc.) for small t : we do not have to introduce thermal spinors
and a dirac-equation for t > 0 in this approximation (see sec. 3.4.4).

furthermore, we calculate the thermal corrections to the electron magnetic moment (see
sec. 3.3) and the thermal mass correction (sec. 3.1.3). we calculate these two quantities e
and me for kbt  me only, since the theory is not yet good for arbitrary temperatures
because of the beforementioned ir-divergencies, and it does not make sense to extract much
information before we have a theory that works for all temperatures at our disposal.

a rather complete version of the calculations can be found here and in the appendices
since our results depend heavily on these detailed somewhat tedious derivations. so we

30beside the spinors u, v. these are spinors as used in the (t = 0)-theory. we emphasize this because
of some calculations in the literature where so-called thermal spinors and a thermal dirac equation are
claimed to be necessary to do qed at t > 0 (e.g. [10]). this is not the case as we will see.

objects. we will not dene it in a rigorous way or discuss it because we will not need it).

31some people claim for example that the dierences in the value of e in literature originate from

problems with non-covariant calculations ([14]).

19

want to provide a reader, who would possibly like or is forced to reproduce the results with
as much material as possible. the calculations to come are done by the causal method as
described in section 2.1.1, starting with t1 from (2.68). doing the calculations we will see
explicitly that ordinary feynman rules could be used when   1 (cf. the remark at the
end of sec. 2.1). this is for example the case in the second order calculations. in the third
order calculations we see in addition that graphs with subgraphs with   0 have to be
treated more carefully - as described in sec. 2.1.2. thus it is not the case as often claimed
in literature that the thermal contributions cause no additional uv-problems. surely, all
the subgraphs with   0 are temperature independent, but in combination with the rest of
the graph they give t -dependent contributions. so the essential structure of possibly new
uv-problems is already known from the (t = 0)-theory, but how they contribute to matrix
elements, etc. depends on the thermal structure as well.

and the corresponding relations for a a, aa, a a. inserting (3.6) and (3.7) in (3.3) we nally
get the expression (c.3), see app. c.1, for d2.

now we have to show that d2, eq. (c.3), has causal support. this is done in app. c.2.
because the temperature independent parts of d2 have causal support separately (see [22])
the temperature dependent parts have to have causal support as well. thus we can split the
t -dependent and -independent parts of d2 separately. the t -independent parts are treated
in [22], so we can restrict ourselves to the investigation of the t -dependent ones. this will
turn out to be a great advantage because for these parts the splitting can always be done
trivially; they all have singular order  < 0 as we will see soon33.

3.1.2 calculation of t2

in this section we calculate t2. we will do that separately for every dierent process that is
contained in d2 (distinguished by dierent operator structures multiplying the numerical
distributions). this is possible because each term that describes a certain process has causal
support on its own (cf. the discussion of the causal support of d2 on page 80). for the longer
calculations we will refer to appendix c.3. a remark on the notation: we often handle the
dierent parts of d2 separately. the akl, ..., dkl on the left indicates from which terms the
expressions on the right origin (cf. eq. (c.3)). we also want to emphasize that sometimes
inessential factors or coecients are omitted in intermediate steps (e.g. during the splitting
procedure). furthermore, we often take track of the (t = 0)-parts just to have complete
formulae. these parts are treated exactly in [22] and are not involved here since the t -
dependent and -independent parts can be treated separately as mentioned above at the end
of sec. 3.1.1.

33this is true in the n-th order as well: as long as the temperature dependent part of dn contains no

(t = 0)-subgraphs with   0 it can be split trivially.

in appendix c.3 we show that the adiabatic limit in the vacuum expectation value of the
vacuum graph is of the form 1
4 c, with c = const. 6= 0. thus the adiabatic limit does not
exist. but we have yet some undened normalization constants at hand from the ( = 4)-
splitting in the (t = 0)-case (see [22], 4.1.27): we can split dierent parts of a distribution
separately if they have causal support each - to do that we each time use the singular order of
the part considered. this provides us with the retarded and advanced parts of these dierent
parts. but the normalization freedom is given by the maximal singular order of all these
parts, since the philosophy is to split all parts with the same operator structure together -
that is with the maximal singular order of these parts35. if we now choose c0 = 0 = c2 and
c4 = c the limit exists. since c = 0 for t = 0 (as can be seen from the expressions in app.
c.3) the result for t = 0 is not changed.

35because of the remarks on the uniqueness of the retarded and advanced parts preceeding eq. (2.34) this

does not contradict the statements above.

remark: up to now we have calculated all contributions to t2.

it can be veried
quite straightforward that all these contributions are symmetric under the transformation
x  y, y  x (use the relations from app. a.2). we see that their temperature dependent
parts are the same as if they had been calculated using ordinary feynman rules (they all
have   1), whereas the (t = 0)-parts have to be treated more carefully as it was done in
[22]. to get some insight in the consequences of these formulae, to extract physical quantities
etc. it remains to perform the involved integrals. we will only do that in the case of the self
energy under the assumption that kbt  me. this will allow the discussion of a possible
thermal mass correction and is done in the next subsection.

3.1.3 self energy and thermal corrections to me

here we want to discuss a possible thermal mass correction by the self energy. this is usually
looked at as follows: we consider the innite summation of self energy graphs

sf(x  y) +z d4x1d4x2sf(x  x1)(x1  x2)sf(x2  y) +
+z d4x1d4x2d4x3d4x4sf(x  x1)(x1  x2)sf(x2  x3)(x3  x4)sf(x4  y) + ... =:
=: stot(x  y).

(3.24)

28

this can be interpreted as sort of a total propagator. taking the fourier transform of this
gives

1

stot(p) =

(2)2
1

=

(2)2

sf(p)+(2)2 sf(p) (p) sf(p) + (2)6 sf(p) (p) sf(p) (p) sf(p) + ... .

(3.25)

since this is a geometric series we can sum it and get

stot =

sf

1  (2)4sf =

1

(sf)1  (24)

=

1

(2)2(/p  m + i0  (2)2)

.

(3.26)

these calculations are not rigorous, e.g. we set g = 1 at the beginning. if we do it with
g 6= 1, such a summation is impossible (just consider the fourier transform of sf(x1 
x2)g(x1)g(x2) + sf(x1  y1)(y1  y2)sf(y2  x2)g(x1)g(x2)g(y1)g(y2) + ...).
another diculty origins in the fact that we have two types of vertices. in the consid-
erations here we investigated the sum of terms with non-tilde vertices only. for a complete
discussion we should somehow incorporate the terms with tilde vertices as well or give ar-
guments why this is not necessary.

however, we will not discuss this and if (3.26) can be derived rigorously without per-
forming the adiabatic limit too early - to do that we should rst have an ir-nite theory at
hand, and this is not the case now as already mentioned (see sec. 3.4.2). so we just want
to discuss some consequences of this formula to compare our results with the literature.
first we see that (2)2 appears as a mass in the propagator - this point of view was also
fruitfully adopted in the (t = 0)-theory, e.g. to determine normalization constants in the
causal approach (see [22], p.213). but as we will see soon,  for t > 0 has - beside the
scalar component - terms proportional to /p and /u, which perhaps should be interpreted as
a thermal change of momentum of the particle. this idea nally leads to the denition and
consideration of thermal spinors and a thermal dirac equation as introduced in [63], [10].
here we just calculate  and evaluate it especially for kbt  me, which practically
means that we can set the fermi-dirac distribution functions f to zero (i.e. we disregard
terms o(eme )). then we derive a thermal mass, which is in agreement with the results
in the literature (e.g. [14], [10]).
to achieve this goal we have to investigate the various terms of (3.23). there are four
terms to be considered, the others can be derived from them (e.g. by using the relations
from app.a.2):

i :

ii :

iii :

iv :

 t =0sf
 t >0sf
 t >0sf
 t >0sf

11(y  x) t >0df
11(y  x) t =0df
11(y  x) t >0df
12(y  x) t >0df

11(y  x)
11(y  x)
11(y  x)
12(y  x)

first we turn to i. using the formula for the fourier transform of a product:

a(x)b(x) dab(p) =

we get the following:

(2)2z d4k a(p  k) b(k),

this has to be a covariant expression and therefore is of the following form:

c0 + cp/p + cu/u, with c0,p,u lorentz scalars, depending on p2 and pu.

(3.30)

to evaluate (3.29) we use (/p/k+m) = 2/p+2/k+4m, and the fact that c0 origins from
the part proportional to m, cp and cu from the one proportional to p + u (after omitting
the  from /p + /u). if we multiply these terms  (p + u) by p and u, respectively, we
get the following three equations:

the calculation of c0,p,u is done in app. c.3.4. the full result (in the approximation
kbt  me and including the factor e2) on the mass shell p2 = m2 is

(3.32)

the terms ii  iv of (3.27) are calculated in the same way, making an ansatz c0 +cp/p + cu/u
and determining these coecients as above. however, in the approximation kbt  me
only the term i is relevant, therefore we will not investigate the other terms anymore.
the result (3.32), after inclusion of the factor (2)2 from (2)2 in (3.26), is in agreement
with [14] (see their reference [16] for their calculations). how to extract a possible mass
correction due to the temperature from this result is not that clear as often claimed. one
way would be to proceed in the usual way (e.g. [2], [10]) by determination of the pole of the
total propagator (3.26) for |~p|  0. this leads to the result known from literature,

m =

e2

12m22 ,

(3.33)

another viewpoint could be the more direct one of taking the term c0 as a mass correc-
tion and the slash-terms cp/p+cu/u as some sort of momentum change; then there would be
no mass correction since c0 = 0 (see (3.32)). we emphasize that the contribution cp/p+ cu/u
cannot be absorbed in normalization constants since they are not of a polynomial structure.
we will not start to discuss this here any further since we take the viewpoint that we should
rst have a consistent thermal eld theory for all temperatures. the determination of a
mass and momentum correction certainly involves a discussion of the dirac equation and
the spinors in the thermal setting as it was done in [63]. as already mentioned it is not
necessary to be concerned with this in the approximation kbt  me - but it may has to
be pursued to formulate a consistent thermal qft for all temperatures (cf. sec. 4).

3.1.4 matrix elements for bremsstrahlung

to discuss the ir-limit in the cross sections to fourth order (see sec. 3.4) we need the contri-
butions from the one photon bremsstrahlung processes. because they are given essentially
by compton-graphs we calculate the matrix elements already in this section on second order
terms. the process is described by compton graphs with an external classical non-tilde

30

photon leg (a c-number potential) and an absorbed or emitted soft photon. according to the
theory we have to build states using the emission operators in the thermal fock space. we
start with the most simple case and discuss general coherent and incoherent superpositions
at the end of this paper. thus we have the following matrix elements:

emission:

absorption:

f i = hbs(~p, )+(~k)a(~k, )+|t compton
sem

2

|b(~q, )+i,

f i = hbs(~p, )+(~k)a(~k, )+|t compton
sabs

2

|b(~q, )+i.

(3.34)

(3.35)

we emphasize that there is no sum over the indices , therefore we write both of them as
superscripts. a remark on : since physical photon states are transversal it is convenient
to introduce real polarization vectors  with  = (0,~), ~k  ~(~k) = 0, ~2 = 1. photon
states are then given by |a(~k)+i. for convenience we choose (~k) for the absorption.
further remarks on this can be found in [22] around (3.5.9) and (2.11.32). to describe the
emission of a photon by the nal state36 ha(~k, )+| with initial state |i is quite natural.
the other graph has to be considered since it also gives a contribution to the investigated
process where we start with |i as the initial state and end up with one ordinary or one
tilde photon. these are the only two possibilities to have h| with a one particle change
in the photon sector as the nal state. thus it is quite natural to interpret this second
contribution as an absorption from the photon bath since this is the only physical process
besides emission, which takes place and changes the heath bath by one particle in the photon
sector. it was already argued in [25], p.120, that the second process describes the generation
of a hole, i.e. absorption of a photon.

now we consider the following contributions to bs: in x2 we have a classical (thus non-
tilde) external potential a(x2)ext and an incoming eld , in x1 an outgoing eld  and a
eld a or  and a. or we have a(x2)ext and an outgoing eld  in x2, an incoming eld
 and a or  and a in x1. thus there are four terms from t c
2 (3.14) that contribute:
a
31. in momentum space, the contributions with
x1 and x2 interchanged give the same result, but this resulting factor two is canceled by the
factor 1

here we used the covariant expression from 2.58 for a(x) in order to keep track in a rigorous
way of the conditions k2 = 0 and k0 = |~k|. the absorption part gives the same except that
we have eikx1 instead of eikx1 and f instead of 1 + f . now we use the following fourier
transformed expressions:

36 in the following discussion we omit the irrelevant polarization vectors and electron emission operators

in the states.

then the xi-integrations give (2)4(k1 + q  q + k)(2)4(k2 + p  q r), which allows
to calculate the q- and r- integrals (in the other three terms we proceed in an analogous
way). in each term one ki-integration can be done trivially leading to a factor (2)2 (cf.
end of sec. 2.1.1). with analogous calculations for the absorption we thus get the following
matrix elements for emission and absorption:

3.2 calculation of some third order graphs

in this section we calculate the third order graphs that play or could play a role in the
discussion of the ir-behaviour of the theory in cross sections to fourth order. thus we
will calculate t3 for the vertex and the third order self energy graph. these have to be
considered in investigating the ir-problem since they will turn out to be innite in the
adiabatic limit g  1. we also discuss the third order vacuum polarization and the graphs
with two bremsstrahlung-photons - they are nite in the limit g  1, therefore we will not
consider them further. to caution the reader we want to emphasize that in the following
calculations we do not consider (t = 0)- and (t > 0)-parts separately. therefore, all formulae
have to be taken literally for the (t > 0)-parts only, the (t = 0)-parts (and (t = 0)-parts
of subgraphs with   0, e.g. in the third order se) are understood to have been treated
correctly, i.e. by splitting them non-trivially. we do not write down this explicitly (cf. also
the remark at the end of sec. 3.1.2).

3.2.1 the vertex graph

dv
3 is calculated in appendix d.1, its singular order as well. we will only consider the
terms with a non-tilde eld a in x3 (since this will be replaced by a classical external
potential in our calculations for the ir-behaviour) and  or  in x1,  or  in x2. the
terms with permuted arguments give the same result in momentum space (as can be shown
by calculating just as we do for the terms we are concerned with here). thus this gives
an additional factor 3! = 6 from the various permutations. but from the expansion of the
s-matrix, (2.1), there is another global factor, 1

6 , which cancels the one above.

3! = 1

here we give the result for t v
we take the rst part of dv

3 and some hints for the calculation:

3 (see app. d.1) and change its form in a suitable way37:

3 = s s+ df  sret s+ d+  s sav d 
dv
 s+ s df + sav s d + s+ sret d+ =

=  sav sret d+ + s sret dav  s sav dret +
+ sret sav d+  sret s dav + sav s dret.

(3.40)

we take the retarded part of it (by trivial splitting since   1, see app. d.1) which gives:
(3.41)

rv
3 =  s sav dret + sret sav d+  sret s dav.

then we have

t3 = r3  r3 =  s sav dret + sret sav d+  sret s dav

+ s(x1  x3) s+ df  sret s+ d+  s sav d =

(3.42)

=  sf sf df.

to obtain this result we have added ssavdfssavdf and ssfdfssfdf, skilfully
splitted sretsfdf in sretsavd+ etc. and used the fact that supp(sretsretdav) = {0}.
37the arguments of the products in the following formula are (x1  x3), (x3  x2), (x1  x2), always in
this order.

3.2.2 third order self energy

there are two graphs that contribute to the third order se: a, with non-tilde elds a
and  in x3 and  or  in x1, and a self energy insertion on the incoming leg; and b, with
non-tilde elds a and  in x3 and  or  in x1, and a self energy insertion on the outgoing

(3.48)

performing the multiplications and investigating the adiabatic limit we see that it exists and
is nite (pay attention to the fact that the whole expression as a distribution need not make
sense evaluated at specied points p, q. it has to be smeared out in these variables, therefore
p = q causes no problems). thus the third order vp is not involved in the discussion of the
ir-problem in the cross sections to fourth order (we will see later (see after (3.88)) that a
third order graph contributes with twice its real part to the fourth order cross section).

3.2.4 graphs with two bremsstrahlung-photons

this contribution has the following form (here we choose special external legs again; cf. the
discussion in sec. 3.2.1):

z d4x1d4x2d4x3 (x1)/aext(x1) sf

11(x1x2)/a(x2) 
11(x2x3)/a(x3)(x3)g(x1)g(x2)g(x3).

 sf

(3.49)

we form matrix elements with emitted/absorbed photons (described by ha(~k, )+| and
ha(~k, )+|, see sec. 3.1.4) of momentum k and k, which are equal to

11(q + k + k + k2 + k3)p1+f (k)
 sf

z d4k1d4k2d4k3p1f(p)us(p)/aext(pqkkk1k2k3) 
q2|~k|p1f(q) 
here we can have pf (k) instead of p1 + f (k), or 12-, 21- and 22-propagators instead of

11-propagators. in addition, not both propagators have to depend on q + k + ..., one or both
of them can as well depend on p + k + .... but all these modications do not change anything
in the following considerations on the existence of the adiabatic limit in these contributions.
in the further calculations we use

11(q+k+k3)p1+f (k)

u(q)g(k1)g(k2)g(k3).

k = k which is valid in the contributions from two bremsstrahlungs photons to the cross
section to fourth order, cf. sec. 3.4.3.

if we calculate now the cross section and integrate over small39 k and k, it is clear that
we have to investigate integrals of the following form (here p2 = m2 = q2 and p denotes

39 since possible divergencies origin from small values of k and k.

this is nite and so are the corresponding integrals with one or two -distributions from
sf. thus the graphs with two bremsstrahlung-photons need not be considered in order to
investigate the ir-behaviour in cross sections to fourth order.

3.3 thermal corrections to e

3.3.1 calculation

in section 3.2.1 we calculated the vertex graph, i.e. t v
3 , eq. (3.43). one part of it will
be important for the discussion of the ir-problem in the cross sections to fourth order (see
sec. 3.4). the other parts will give some thermal corrections to the magnetic moment of
the electron. in this section we will be concerned with the calculation of these corrections.
before we explain how the vertex contributes to the electron magnetic moment, we rst
investigate its structure more closely to be able to identify the before-mentioned parts. to
do that we consider the vertex in momentum space, i.e. its fourier transform. since we will
be interested in electron scattering to determine e (see below, after (3.70)) we study the
matrix element

sf i = hbs(~p, )+|t vertex

|b(~q, )+i

(3.53)

ing -matrix structure of the vertex contribution (see the explicit representation of the
propagators in momentum space, app. a.3.):

in this expression, the factors  bsf(p  k1  k) bsf(q + k2  k) lead to the follow-
 bsf(p  k1  k) bsf(q + k2  k)  (/p  /k1  /k + m)(/q + /k2  /k + m).

(3.56)

since we are interested in the adiabatic limit of these quantities (cf. the discussion in sec.
3.4 and after eq. (3.58)) and this can be performed trivially, we can omit ki, i = 1, 2, in the
numerator (cf. as well the end of sec. 2.1.1) and get (using the denition /p := p and
 +  = 2g,  = 2 etc.)

(/p  /k + m)(/q  /k + m) =

= (2/q/p + 4mq + 4mp  2m2) + (2/k/p + 2/q/k  8mk)  2/k/k.

(3.57)

because of u(p) on the left and u(q) on the right of the whole expression (3.55) this gives
(using 2/q/p = 2/p/q  4p/q  4q/p + 4pq and the dirac equation)

u(p)h4pq + 4(/k(p + q)  mk  (pk + qk))  2/k/kiu(q).

(3.58)

the rst of these terms, independent of k, is the one we will discuss in section 3.4 where
we investigate the ir-limit. it is the only term of (3.58) that leads to ir-divergencies. here
we will be concerned with the nite part of the vertex, for which the adiabatic limit can be
performed trivially without problems. the goal of the following calculations is to determine
the thermal corrections to the magnetic moment of the electron, e. we will not do that
in the most general setting, we will restrict ourselves to small temperatures: kbt  me.
from the four terms of t v
3 , (3.43), then only the rst survives, and only the third term
of (3.58), proportional to kk, contributes. in this approximation, the rst term of (3.58)
does not contain any nite parts and gets cancelled completely by the contribution of the
bremsstrahlung (see sec. 3.4), and the second term (proportional to k) vanishes identically
as can be seen by symmetry arguments40.

40consider the transformation k  k in (3.55) after inserting the explicit form of the propagators from

app. a.3 and considering only the terms  k in the numerator.

38

thus we have to calculate the following part of the matrix element41 (3.55):

this integral has to be calculated. because of the lorentz covariance of this expression and

t 
v (p, q, u) = ag +b(pp + qq ) + c(pq + qp) +

+ d(pu + up + qu + uq ) + g(uu).

(3.62)

now we take the trace in this expression or multiply it with pp, pq , pu or uu,
respectively, and thus get the following system of ve equations:

with the gordon decomposition42,

us(p)(p + q)u(q) = 2mus(p)u(q)  i(p  q ) u(q),

(3.68)

(3.69)

we get from (3.62), after some manipulations and taking the u on the left and the u on the
right end into account,

(p, q, u) =(cid:16)  2a + 2m2b + 4m2c  2(pq)c  2(pu)d  2(qu)d  g(cid:17)
 2im(b + c)(p  q) + 2u(2md + /ug) + 2(p + q)/ud.

(3.70)

to extract information on e from (3.70) we proceed as described for the case t = 0 in
[22], p.236. we consider electron scattering on an external static c-number potential at low
energies. we calculate in the rest frame of the heat bath: u = (1,~0) and use the standard
representation for spinors with the same normalization convention as in [22]:

us(~p) =r e + m

2e (cid:18) s

e+m s(cid:19) ,

where e :=p~p2 + m2. this is most convenient for the non-relativistic case |~p|  me we

these expressions will now be used to calculate the matrix element describing the before-
mentioned electron scattering we are interested in. in the low temperature approximation
this matrix element is given by (3.53) or (3.59), respectively, and just this term contributes
as explained above. to compare with the value of e without any corrections, we consider
the rst order matrix element, which is given by

thus we only have to know a, the other parameters are irrelevant for the magnetic moment
in this approximation. nevertheless we cannot avoid solving the whole system (3.63) -
(3.67). the solution will be calculated in appendix d.3. we only need the solution in
the case of p = q, therefore we investigate the solution of the system for q := p   with
0  ~2  m2 and then consider the limit   0. pay attention
q2 = (p  )2 = m2 and 2
43as mentioned above: we calculate in the system u = (1, ~0).
44the following formula is the fourier transform of ~b = rot ~a.
45these are the rst order term and the thermal correction; the qed corrections at t = 0 are not included
e
here. - to distinguish factors that do not belong to e we use the fact that
2m is the magnetic moment of
the electron determined in the framework of relativistic qm. to set p = q to identify the magnetic moment
stems from a less intuitive discussion of expressions like (3.77) as it is done in [64], p.347. there it is shown
that the quasi-static limit p = q allows the discussion and identication of e quite similar to the one in
the framework of relativistic qm.

41

to the facht that due to the above denitions we have 0 = p0  p0q1  ( 2~p~

). we
emphasize that setting p = q in the linear system and then solving it is in general not
allowed, but here it leads to the same result. we will discuss that and what could go wrong
this way at the end of sec. 3.3.2.

now we present the result for the magnetic moment of the electron, including the qed-
correction for t = 0 and the corrections due to t > 0, each up to third order in e (see app.

3.3.2 discussion of the result

in this section we want to discuss the result (3.81) for e a little bit and to compare it with
the existing results in literature. we are aware of nine papers wherein e is calculated46:
[3] and [10] - [17]. the results of these papers disagree partially; we can nd three dierent
e
2m , where in some of the references
values, which we report here, in units of magnetons
temperature dependent values for e and m are used. but in the approximation kbt  me,
which we are considering here this temperature-dependence can be omitted (we refer to the
cited literature for a more exact treating, here we are just interested in giving an idea of
what the results in literature are like and how they dier from our). now we give the values
from the literature47:

e2

182m2 ,

reported by [10] - [13], [16] and [17],

reported by [3] and [14],

(3.82)

reported by [15].







e2

362m2 ,
19e2

2702m2 ,

so all the results are of the same magnitude with respective factors 1, 2, 5
2 . we agree with
the second result and in absolute numbers it reads approximatively (for t = 293 k,  and
c not set equal to 1 anymore)

e = 0.62  1017 

e
2m

.

(3.83)

2m .

for comparison we give the value of the (t = 0)-corrections up to the same order:
1.16  103  e
among all these calculations there is just one that is formulated covariantly, [14], - as is
ours. we agree with them that all the diering results quoted arise because it is quite tricky
to identify the magnetic moment of the electron in a non-covariant setting.

82 =

e

2m  e2

to caution the reader we emphasize that there could be a dierence between our result
and the one from [14] that could be traced back to their setting p = q too early (cf. the
remark after (d.14): because the determinant of the linear system is zero for p = q it is not
allowed to set p = q at the beginning. the procedures of taking the limit q = p  ,   0
and solving the equation system do not commute!). if we set p = q   = 0 at the very
46there are other papers that give values for e , e.g.

[19] or [20], but for the calculation they refer to

one of this nine papers. one paper, [18], we could not nd.

47[11] has the wrong sign due to some error; it is corrected in [13]. and [16] argues that a qft calculation
should reproduce a correction of  5e2
362m2 , which was obtained by some other method, an eective hamilto-
nian method, incorporating some intuitive ideas on the nature of the electron and not using covariant qed.
he then identies the value of  e2
182m2 as part of it and gives some arguments why the calculations that
lead to the rst result in (3.82) just can account for 2

5 of the desired value.

42

beginning of our calculation, i.e. in (d.1), we get ve equations. two of them are identical.
we throw away one of them, arguing with (3.62) that b and c must not be distinguished
for p = q and therefore just four variables, a, b, d, g, have to be determined. solving this
new linear system we end up with

a =

3

92m2 ,

(3.84)

which fortunately is the same result as we have - but this will not be true in general.

3.4 the infrared problem in thermal qed in cross sections to

fourth order

in this section we investigate the adiabatic limit in the cross section for scattering of an elec-
tron on an external classical c-number potential to fourth order. to do that we have to con-
sider the contributions from the vertex, the third order self energy and the bremsstrahlung
with one bs-photon. there are no other second order contributions and the other third
order graphs that could contribute are nite (see sec. 3.2.3 and 3.2.4). we calculate the
cross sections for these processes, which will contain ir-divergent parts in the limit g  1.
then we investigate if the various divergent parts perhaps cancel. this is not the case for
arbitrary temperatures, whereas it is in the approximation kbt  me. we caution the
reader that we often write down the expressions for the (t = 0)-parts as if they had been
calculated using ordinary feynman rules. this is not the case, they have to be treated
correctly according to the causal theory as described in 2.1.2. but we have chosen to write
them down in this simple manner to keep track of them without complicating the notation.
this is possible since the t -independent parts can be treated separately (cf. end of sec.
3.1.1) and their cancellation was prooved in [22]. the same remark applies to some terms
of the temperature dependent part of the third order se including sub-graphs of singular
order   0.

thus we have to calculate the cross sections for these various processes, i.e.

(cid:19)div.
(cid:18) 

4.ord.

f i,3.ord. + sv

= |sf i,1.ord. + sse

f i,2.ord.(sem

f i,2.ord.) + sabs
+ sf i,1.ord.(sv+se

f i,2.ord.(sabs
f i,3.ord.) + sv+se

f i,3.ord.(sf i,1.ord.).

f i,2.ord.|2 + |sabs

f i,2.ord.|2 =

to shorten the notation in the calculations we dene the following quantities:

< pf(p) > :=(cid:18)(p0)pf(p)(1  f(p))  (p0)pf+(p)(1  f+(p))(cid:19),
< f(p) > :=(cid:18)(p0)f(p) + (p0)f+(p)(cid:19).

(3.85)

(3.86)

since we are interested in the adiabatic limit we set ki = 0 wherever this is already possible
(according to the remark after (2.32)).

3.4.1 cross sections of the involved processes

vertex: we consider the matrix element (3.53)

sf i = hbs(~p, )+|t v

3 |b(~q, )+i.

(3.87)

43

we proceed as in sec. 3.3, but now we are interested in the rst, i.e. k-independent part in
(3.58). since the vertex is of third order it contributes to the cross section (3.85) with

sf i,1.ord.(sv

f i) + sv

f i(sf i,1.ord.).

(3.88)

from (3.58) we see that the interesting part of the vertex is proportional to u(p) u(q), i.e.
proportional to sf i,1.ord.. using sv
f i =: hsf i,1.ord. and by inserting the explicit expressions

44

for the propagators into (3.55), we thus have

we get the terms for the absorption from the ones for the emission by changing k  k
(not in (k0)) and f  1 + f . performing the k0-, k0- and ~k-integrations we get a factor
1
, and we see that k = k. in order to compare this with the contributions from the vertex
2|~k|
and the self energy we integrate over small photon energies |~k|  0  me, where 0 can
be interpreted as some nite energy resolution of the detector. since we are interested in
the adiabatic limit we can replace < f(p  k1 + k) > by < f(p) >, etc. furthermore,
we set p2 = m2 = q2. performing the various multiplications gives the following 2 times 36

3.4.2 investigation of possible cancellations

now we compare the cross sections we calculated in the foregoing section. we investigate if
there is a net cancellation of all the divergent terms or not. the result will be that there is
no complete cancellation, certain contributions from the self energy and the bremsstrahlung
do not cancel. the vertex on the other hand causes no problems. furthermore, we will see
that there is a complete cancellation if we have small temperatures kbt  me.
concretely we will consider the following things: we will integrate the bs-contribution
from |~k| = 0 to 0  1, which accounts for soft photons that remain undetected (here 0 can
be interpreted as some nite energy resolution of the detector). this also xes the lorentz
system: it is the laboratory system, i.e. the rest system of the bath, i.e. u = (1,~0). the
k-integration in the v- and se-contributions will then be considered for values |~k|  [0, 0]
as well, since possible divergencies origin from k = 0 only. thus we can treat k0 = |~k| as
small and omit it where this is possible. since we are interested in the adiabatic limit, we
will set  = 0  ki = 0 where this is allowed (cf. the remark after (2.32)). thus we can

59

for example replace < pf(q + k1 + k2) > by < pf(q) >, < f(p + k  k2) > by

< f(p) >, etc. in addition we choose the test function g to be symmetric and real, which
is no big restriction since we are interested in the limit g  1. now we list how several
terms compensate and which terms remain in the end.
vertex and pq-terms of bs: we often use the fact that the two bs-terms that are
considered together with one v-term are the complex conjugate of each other and thus the
sum is twice the real part.

-: v1 + bsi + bsv gives the terms proportional to pq of the (t = 0)-bs multiplied with
(1  f(p))(1  f(q)) and compensates v16 (cf. [22], sec. 3.11). this can be seen as
follows: v1 has an integrand proportional to (since we are interested in the real part
we consider the principal value part only)

p

(2p(k1  k) + (k1  k)2 + i0)(2q(k2  k) + (k2  k)2 + i0)

f

.

(3.99)

the bs-contributions bsi + bsv plus the corresponding terms from absorption give
after some transformation of variables an integrand proportional to

p

(2p(k1 + k) + (k1 + k)2 + i0)(2q(k2  k) + (k2  k)2 + i0)

(k0)  f

.

(3.100)

1+x = 1 
now we expand the factors in the denominators (using a formula like  1
x adapted to this case) and compare the resulting terms. we see that the leading
divergencies ad up to the (t = 0)-part of the bremsstrahlung and thus compensate
v16. the next to leading order term is of the form

p

f (k)(k + k1)2
(2p(k + k1))2

1

2q(k2  k)

.

(3.101)

the transformation k  k, ki  ki then generates a change in the global sign
and thus the integral is identical zero. the other terms are nite and vanish in the
adiabatic limit.

-: v4 +bsii +bsvii: proceeding as above we get for the vertex an integrand proportional

to

+(2p(k  k1) + (k  k1)2)(2q(k2  k) + (k2  k)2)f (k)

(3.102)

and for the bremsstrahlung

(2p(k  k1) + (k  k1)2)(2q(k2  k) + (k2  k)2)((k0) + f (k)).
with the help of (k2) it can be seen that the terms (k2  k)2 etc.
in the other
-distributions can be neglected. then it follows that the divergent terms (the terms
proportional to f (k)) cancel between bs and v and the f -independent term from bs
is nite.

that vanishes because of antisymmetry under the transformation of variables ki  ki

we want to add some remarks on the crucial factor two in the calculations above: each
vertex contribution comes with two corresponding bs-contributions, thus resulting in a net
cancellation. for each self energy contribution, on the other hand, there is just one bs-
contribution. for seb + bsa + seo the partial fraction decomposition (3.105) leads to an
additional factor two in bsa, thus leading to a net cancellation. the same considerations
apply to seb
. however, there is no partial fraction decomposition (3.105)
involved in the (t > 0)-contributions since one or two of these factors are replaced by a
-distribution. thus there is no additional factor two for these terms and in consequence no
cancellation either.

3.4.3 investigation of possible cancellations with mixed states

in this section we want to analyse possible cancellations using more general asymptotic
states. it will turn out that not even the use of general mixed states or coherent superposi-
tions leads to a cancellation of the ir-divergencies.

first, we consider incoherent mixtures of states with one electron, on electron and one
photon, ordinary and tilde, one electron and two photons, ordinary and tilde. higher
numbers of photons do not have to be considered since we are interested in the cross section
to fourth order only. from more than two photons some are merely spectators and not
involved in the processes.

we will not use a density matrix formulation for the problem. thus we will have to
calculate the cross sections corresponding to the various parts of the initial and nal state,
take the weightened mean over the initial contributions and the sum over the nal ones. we
write for the initial state (we have suppressed to write down the vacuum  on which the

62

emission operators act)

the q-integration is over the mass shell (ms), the k1,2-integration over |~k1,2|  0 and the
sum runs over four polarizations50 i, j = 1, ..., 4. the -dependence in the various thermal
emission operators is suppressed in the notation. since the cis etc. represent probability
densities we have c0, c1, ..., c2  0 and the normalization condition

(3.110)

furtheron c2 and c2 are symmetric in the arguments k1 and k2 and the indices i, j.

the s-matrix terms involved are the same as in the sections 3.4.1 and 3.4.2. we group
them according to the number of bremsstrahlung photons (bsp) involved: zero bsp : the
rst order contribution and third order vertex and self energy 51. one bsp : the second
order bs contributions. two bsp: the three third order terms with two bs photons.

performing the sum and integration over the possible nal states we get 36 contributions
to the cross section, each involving a weighting factor c0, c1, ... and integrals over the electron
and photon momenta. they are listed in appendix e.

now we investigate the cross section given by (e.2). we rst consider the case of sharp
momenta for the incoming and outgoing electron, i.e.
there is no integration over these
momenta. then52 the coecient of |hb+|0|b+i|2 equals 1 by the normalization condition
(3.110).
for the leading contributions to
the ir-divergencies and the structure of a applied to |a+i, etc. we see that the contributions
proportional to the product of zero and two bsp factors are of the following form:

using the -distributions, the fact that f  1 + f  1
|ku|

50we decided for shortness and completeness to indicate the four involved photon polarizations in this

way directly in the emission operators.

51the third order vacuum polarisation could at most give next to leading order in divergencies (cf. sec.

3.2.3).

52in the following we write |0|, |1| and |2| in the matrix elements for the zero, one and two bsp-contribution

to the s-matrix.

63

z d3k1h0ihb+a+(k1)|2|b+a+(k1)i  [ terms involving c1, ...].

(3.111)

since the cs obey the normalization condition and are positive, no integral of the form

r dkc(k) can show ir-divergencies. furthermore, the products h0ih2i are nite as well (see

sec. 3.2.4), thus the whole contribution involving these products of zero and two bsp
contributions is nite.

therefore, we only have to consider the zero bsp contributions, which are the same as
in the calculation with pure states as already mentioned and the one bsp contributions we
will examine now.

using the relations between hb+a+|1|b+i, hb+a+|1|b+i, hb+|1|b+a+i and hb+|1|b+a+i
(k  k and f  1+f replacements are involved) and the fact that f  1+f  1
for the
|ku|
leading contributions to the ir-divergencies we can write the leading one bps contribution
as follows:

1bps =

=xi z d3k1(cid:26) + |hb+a+

+ |hb+a+

i (k1)|1|b+i|2hc0(q) +xm z d3l1c1(q, l1)m +xm z d3l1c1(q, l1)m +
+ c1(q, k1)i +xn z d3l2c2(q, k1, l2)in +xn z d3l2c2(q, k1, l2)ini +
i (k1)|1|b+i|2hc0(q) +xm z d3l1c1(q, l1)m +xm z d3l1c1(q, l1)m +
+ c1(q, k1)i +xn z d3l2c2(q, k1, l2)in +xn z d3l2c2(q, k1, l2)ini(cid:27)

(3.112)

we look at the p2, q2- and pq-contributions in the cross section factors of this expression
separately as we did in sec. 3.4.2. since the zero bps contribution are the same as before,
we see that each pq-contribution should nally give the same value as before, thus cancelling
the vertex contributions. the p2, q2-contributions, however, should undergo a change which
amounts to a factor 2 for the (t > 0)-parts, accounts especially for the se-graphs seh,h
(bs, bs have to change in this way) and does not spoil the cancellation of the (t = 0)-parts
(i.e. bsa, bse should give the same as before); cf. sec. 3.4.2.

to investigate this further we write the one bsp cross section in the following form (cf.
(3.97)). unimportant global factors are omitted and the + in the argument of f

eq.
indicates the (+k0) involved):

xi z d3k|hb+(p)a+

i (k)|1|b+(q)i|2 =

=xi z d4k1z d4k2g(k1)g(k2)z d3k 
hf (p, q, k1, k, (k))i + f (q, p,k1,k, (k))ii 
hf (p, q, k2, k, (k))i + f (q, p,k2,k, (k))ii

(3.113)

the analogous term with a+ instead of a+ reads the same after having replaced k with k
(not in the -function involved). we have from (3.112)

64

1bps = +xi z d4k1z d4k2g(k1)g(k2)z d3k(cid:26)

+(cid:16)f (p, q, k1, k, +)if (p, q, k2, k, +)i + f (q, p,k1,k, +)if (q, p,k2,k, +)i(cid:17) 
+(cid:16)f (p, q, k1,k, +)if (p, q, k2,k, +)i + f (q, p,k1, k, +)if (q, p,k2, k, +)i(cid:17) 

(3.114)

the qs abbreviate the terms involving the cs. consider the leading contributions to the ir-
divergencies in gg, i.e. the terms (k  ki)2 can be omitted. then each pq-contribution
equals the positive or negative of the corresponding p2, q2-contribution for p  q. using
the continuity of g in p and q and g(p, p, ...) 6= 0 we see53 that it is impossible to nd qs
(and hence cs) that meet the afore-mentioned conditions (cf. after eq. (3.112)) and lead to
a cancellation of all ir-divergencies.

the same consideration applies to the case of sharply peaked momenta centered around
q and p of the in- and outgoing electrons, respectively, even if we allow small deviations from
p2 = m2 = q2. the case of arbitrary coherent superposition of states can be investigated
using similar arguments and does not lead to a cancellation as well.

3.4.4 discussion of the results

in this section we make several remarks on the results of the last one and discuss the results
established in literature in relation to ours. in section 4 we will present some ideas how the
problems that arise here in the ir-behaviour possibly could be cured.

- first we want to emphasize that there is no cancellation of ir-divergencies in qed at
nite temperature in the cross sections to fourth order if we do not restrict ourselves to
small temperatures (see the second point). the vertex contributions to the divergency
cancel with some part of the bremsstrahlung, whereas the self energy contributions
do not. especially the terms seh and seh
 cause problems since they are of a
structure that does not arise in the bremsstrahlung (in seh and seh
 we have non-
tilde external legs leading to a factor (1  f(p))(1  f(q)) and an inner tilde vertex
leading to 12-propagators. the bs terms either have a factor (1  f(p))(1  f(q))
and no 12-propagator or a 12-propagator and the wrong factor involving f). the
other se-terms that do not compensate dier by a factor two from corresponding
53for p = q, perform the transformation k1,2  k1,2 in the second and fourth summand. then we
see that we can write (gg + gg)[2q + q + q] for the sum of the rst two and last two summands,
respectively.

65

bs-terms. thus we disagree with the existing literature that claims ir-niteness
for all temperatures ([1], [2], etc.) and have doubts if proofs of ir-niteness to all
orders ([1]) could rigorously be performed. we will discuss the shortcomings in the
literature in point three. in addition to the external states considered usually we have
investigated mixed states as well. we nd the same result: there is no cancellation of
ir-divergencies.

, seo

- secondly we see that the restriction to small temperatures kbt  me nally leads
to ir-nite values. in this case only v1, v16, seb, seo, seb
, bsi, bsv, bsa
and bse contribute. in contrast to the literature we have this cancellation in a very
straightforward way without the necessity to introduce temperature dependent spinors
or a thermal dirac equation as it is introduced in ([63]) and used by many other
authors. thus we see that the consideration of the fermi-dirac-distribution f, which
in itself is ir-nite causes more than just minor irrelevant changes with respect to the
low temperature case (as claimed in [1], [2]): the niteness present in the latter gets
completely lost.
pay attention to the fact that in this approximation the contributions with |~k| > 0
from v1, bsi and bsv cancel exactly. that is why there is no contribution to the
magnetic moment from this part of the vertex.

- in this third point we discuss several papers and the reasons for which they end up

with nite results and why they are wrong or do not contradict our results.

a rst group of papers ([10], [13], [63] and [65] - [67]) presents calculations in the low
temperature approximation kbt  me only. as mentioned above we agree with the
ir-niteness found by them in this approximation; but as our calculations show, one
cannot extract from this any results concerning arbitrary temperatures, and to use
this niteness as a hint for the existence of ir-cancellations to all orders at t > 0 is
too optimistic.

a second group of papers ([4] - [7]) is concerned with arbitrary temperatures but
neglects the thermal modication of the fermion propagators via f on more or less
clear reasons. thus the fact that they nd a complete cancellation of ir-divergencies
does not contradict our results since we have this as well if we omit the terms with
factors f.
the papers ([2], [3] and [8]) leave out the doubling of elds in their cancellation and
thus especially do not have to face the contributions seh, seh
, which cause the major
problems in our calculations. especially in [2] there are some terms missing: without
reason, they claim to have no modication of the bremsstrahlung by the fermi-dirac-
distribution and in their contribution to the vertex and the self energy they only have
the terms v2, v3, sea, sed, sea
in the paper [1] there are some shortcomings in the considerations after their equation
(32): in their general investigation of the n-th order they consider s/ks for each vertex
and set g = 1 from the very beginning. but in the third order we are interested in,
one has to investigate u/ks/ksu  b and the limit g  1 has to be performed at the
very end. the net eect of the former treatment with respect to the latter is again a
the omission of contributions as seh, seh
the paper [9] also neglects the doubling of elds.

, which do not cause any problem anyway.

and sec

.

besides that there are some papers that consider other problems than we did, [68] and
[69], to mention just two, which consider 3 and 4 theories, respectively, which have
quite a dierent structure from qed.

- furthermore it is clear from the discussion that there are a lot of nite contributions
from these various terms considered above. as in the (t = 0)-case they possibly depend

66

on the test function g (see [22], sec. 3.12). we do not consider this here any further
since it is of no importance as long as the whole theory stays divergent in the adiabatic
limit as it does now.

4 conclusion

in this work we investigated qed at nite temperatures in perturbation theory. using the
causal approach to qft we are not confronted with any uv-divergency and have a method
at hand to rigorously discuss the ir-behaviour of the theory by investigating the adiabatic
limit.

we have calculated several second and third order graphs and derived corrections to
me and e due to the eects of the temperature. our results agree with the ones in the
literature.

the main result, however, is the fact that the theory is not ir-convergent. already in the
cross sections to fourth order there is no complete cancellation of the various ir-divergent
terms in the case of arbitrary temperatures. this result remains valid even if we set the
chemical potential  equal zero with the consequence that f = f+ or if we use more general
mixed states or coherent superpositions as initial and nal ones. for small temperatures the
cancellation can be established in a straightforward way without the necessity to introduce
thermal spinors.

now we give some ideas, which perhaps could be pursued to construct an ir-nite theory

for qed at t > 0.

a rst idea would be to use the normalization freedom of the causal approach due to
the distribution-splitting with singular order   0 to get rid of the divergent terms in the
adiabatic limit. but as a close inspection of these terms readily shows, this is not possible
since these terms do not have the structure of a polynomial - not even in the adiabatic limit.
another idea is to change the decomposition of the eld operators (2.57), (2.63) into
positive and negative frequency parts or to dene the thermal absorption and emission
operators in a dierent way. but it seems quite impossible to do that in a reasonable way
without violating the causality of the support of the d2-distribution. since this property
is crucial for the causal construction of the s-matrix, the implementation of this approach
seems impossible.

the third - and perhaps most promising - idea is to change the involved scattering states
in a suitable way. on grounds of the observation that the divergent vertex contributions
cancel and only the self energy (and the corresponding bremsstrahlung terms) cause di-
culties we could try to absorb these se-contributions in the fermionic states by summation
(proceeding as for the thermal mass corrections, see sec. 3.1.3). this reasoning leads to
a modied dirac equation and temperature dependent spinors as it was done in [63] for
the low temperature limit. diculties surely will arise through the two types of vertices
that should be considered in a complete summation scheme and through the mathematical
subtleties that origin in the structure of a thermal dirac equation.
compare to the case of charged particles in the (t = 0)-theory. to have a unique nite
adiabatic limit the unphysical degrees of freedom of the photon have to be considered in the
bremsstrahlung ([22], sec. 3.12.). this can be seen as some manifestation that the physical
scattering states are not free electrons but have always a coulomb-eld attached to them.
the presence of a thermal bath perhaps inuences somehow the eects of these unphysical
degrees of freedom.

another point that is not yet clear is the process of thermalization: intuitively it should
be the case that a particle immersed in a heath-bath looses momentum by repeated scattering
processes; this is not the case in our framework. but to take intuition as a guide is not always
the best thing to do.

some other ideas we did not investigate at all are the following: implementation of the
temperature in a dierent way, i.e. not as a scalar (cf. footnote 26), dierent treatment of

67

the fermionic part of the theory, i.e. not through the implementation of the fermi-dirac-
distribution in the theory in a way so similar to the photons or description of the theory
using infraparticles (see e.g [56] and references therein) to mention just three.

finally, we mention that in the opinion of some authors (e.g. [70]) a consistent pertur-
bation theory for a qft including temperature is not possible at all or at least not in such
a direct way as known from the (t = 0)-case. we do not adopt this view, but the physical
content and foundations of the theory have to be investigated and thought over very care-
fully in order to set up a sensible thermal qed. thus it could be that the theory is not good
for arbitrary temperatures because the fermionic contribution from the heat-bath (virtual
pair generation) is not incorporated correctly by treating it more or less analogously to the
photon-part.

b three intuitive observations in tfd

in this appendix we present some unrigorous considerations, which may help to develop
some intuition for tfd:

particle number operator: calculate the expectation value of the ordinary (t = 0)-

particle number operator for scalar bosons in the thermal vacuum:

h|a(~k)+a(~k)|i

(2.64)

=

=d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)p1 + f a(~k, )+ pf a(~k, )(cid:17)(cid:16)p1 + f a(~k, ) pf a(~k, )+(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)e =

=d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)pf a(~k, )(cid:17)(cid:16)pf a(~k, )+(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)e = f (k).

here we made use of h|a(~k, )+ = 0 and a(~k, )|i = 0. so the thermal vacuum seems
to mimic a black body heath bad as we expect it to do.

(b.1)

electron in a heath bath: consider the following calculation (for the formulae with

eig we refer to [24]):

b(~p, )+|i = eigb(~p)+eig|i = eigb(~p)+eigeig|0i =
= eigb(~p)+|0i = b(~p)+eig|0i = b(~p)+|i.

(b.2)

74

so it could be said that b(~p, )+ generates an electron with momentum ~p in the thermal
setting. but this should not be taken as a sound physical interpretation of the formulae.

a third observation: set t = 0 in the formulae of subsection 2.2.2; then we get two copies

of ordinary qed at t = 0.

thus we proved that d2 has causal support, and the requirements for the inductive causal
construction are met. in addition we can see that the sum of the b- and c-contributions to
d2 equals zero.

(c.4)

we consider the singular order of the (t > 0)-parts in momentum space. according to
(2.36) we thus have to investigate the following expression (we suppress some unimportant
factors):

with

()h (

lim

p


), (p)i != h 0(p), (p)i,

(p) :=z d4q t >0bs()

in the rst summand we have x = p0r2+m2
|~p|r2 . because of 1  x  1, this equation
requires r to full some additional condition. this claims r  1
 for   0, and the following
considerations are thus valid also for u = (1, 0). after investigation of the integrand we can
verify that all assumptions of the theorem of lebesgue are met and it thus applies54. thus
we can perform the limit in the integrand and it follows that the whole expression converges

are calculated. then we insert 1 =r d4k(q1  q2  p k) and evaluate the k0-integral with
55herep1/2 :=qf(q1/2)(1  f(q1/2)).

54 some problems possibly could be caused by p  {p  m | p2 = 0}. but since this is a set of measure

evaluation of the trace gives 8(2m2  q1q2), and with (q2

i  m2) the q1,0- and q2,0-integrals

 (p|~q1|2 + m2 q(~q1  ~p  ~k)2 + m2  p0  |~k|).

here the limit   0 can be performed without problems, the whole expression (without the
factor 1
4 ) converges to a p-independent constant, which can be cancellated by a suitable
normalization term56. thus we established the existence of the adiabatic limit of the vacuum
expectation value for the b + c-part of the vacuum graph.

as for the a + d-term:

z d4q1d4q2tr[....](q2

(cid:20)(q1,0)  f(q1)(q1,0)  f+(q1)(q1,0)(cid:21) 
(cid:20)  (q2,0) + f(q2)(q2,0) + f+(q2)(q2,0)(cid:21) 
 ((q1  q2  p)2)(cid:20)(q1,0  q2,0  p0) + f (q1  q2  p)(cid:21).

its (t = 0)-part is discussed in [22], p.263 (it equals d(p) as it is dened there) and does not
cause any problems because of the factor (p2  4m2). the temperature dependent part has
the same -structure as the term discussed above and thus converges in the adiabatic limit
to a constant, which can be cancelled by suitable normalization as well.

in the following.

distribution. then we write the integral in polar coordinates, the -integration is trivial,
giving a factor 2, and the x-integration is straightforward and yields an integrand propor-
tional to

m

dx(cid:20)
z 1
p2  m2  2p0r  2|~p|r + i0(cid:19) +
ln(cid:18) p2  m2  2p0r + 2|~p|r + i0

p2  m2 + 2p0r + 2|~p|rx + i0(cid:21) =

ln(cid:18) p2  m2 + 2p0r + 2|~p|r + i0

=

2|~p|r

this is well dened for all values of r and x as can be seen readily. if we now have p2 = m2 it
can be veried using ln(a + ib) = ln(a2 + b2) + iarg(a + ib) that the real and the imaginary
parts are zero each.

cp,u: because the parts proportional to (pu) and p2, respectively, in the integrals for
cp, cu in (3.31) have the same structure as c0, which was dened by the corresponding
integral with m2 in the numerator, these parts can be omitted for p2 = m2. solving the
62 , equation (3.32) can

remaining integrals as above and additionally usingr 

er1 = 2

be veried.

d third order calculations

for d3 the general calculation scheme is as follows: we write down the various involved
products of tks according to the causal approach. then we perform the contractions which
lead to contributions with external legs we are interested in and consider only these terms.

this is calculated using the following formulae (see (2.7)):



t 1(x) = t1(x),



t 2(x1, x2) = t2(x1, x2) + t1(x1)t1(x2) + t1(x2)t1(x1).

the three terms of the second equation dene the three parts of r33: r33,1 + r33,2 + r33,3,
analogously for a33. we take here just the terms with external elds we are interested in
(cf. sec. 3.2.1): in x3 there shall be an ordinary eld aext
 (x3), no tilde eld; in x1 shall
be (x1) or (x1), in x2 (x2) or (x2).

nevertheless, we write it down here in detail to give a reference of the various signs, factors

there are two graphs that have to be calculated, denoted by a and b, respectively, (see
sec. 3.2.2). as in the calculation for the vertex we have:

the terms with type 2 in x2 give

d3.ord.se,b;x2:type2

because both d12 and s12 are equal to zero. likewise we have

d3.ord.se,b;x2:type1

3,  

= 0 and d3.ord.se,b;x2:type2

3,  

= 0.

d3 for graph a is calculated in the same way.

2. singular order
the structure of the third order se graphs is s(x3  x2)s(x2  x1)d(x1  x2). this gives
relevant, because the rst factor (s) has singular order   1 and the second one is

after fourier transformation s(q)r d4k s(q + k) d(k), which means that only 2.ord.se is

98

exactly the second order se. since the temperature dependent parts of the second order se
have singular order   1 the temperature dependent parts of the third order se can be
split trivially.

(2qk + i0)

.

(d.2)

we choose the lorenz system with u = (1,~0) and q = (q0, 0, 0,|~q|). then we perform the k0-
integration with the -distribution and choose polar coordinates for the spatial integration
(x := cos()). this gives

in the second term we transform x  x and see that in the sum with the rst term the
imaginary part vanishes identically and the real part gives the same contribution two times.

now the x-integration can be performed, and we have after transforming back to a general

(d.9)

again we choose polar coordinates. the k0-integration is done with (k2), and the r-
integration decouples from the other variables and can be performed (using formulae as for
the r-integration in i2). then we transform x  x,      in the term with k0 = r,
 . now we
can see that the term with k0 = r equals the complex conjugate of the term with k0 = r
and thus the sum is two times its real part. we get

57here we give some relations necessary to perform this transformation from the special system with
u = (1, ~0), q = (q0, 0, 0, |~q|) back to a general one: p0  pu,
|~q| 
p(qu)2  m2, p3  (pu)(qu)pq

58it has to be veried that the possible poles are integrable. this is done best by cutting them from
the integration interval and then extend the result to this border values of the interval. in addition, using
q2 = m2 > 0, |x|  1, etc. it can be shown that the radicand in the resulting formulae is always positive.

. these relations can be veried straightforward.

now we want to solve the linear system (d.1). we did that using maple and get the general
solution for a, ..., g. then we set q := p  with q2 = (p )2 = m2 and let it be simplied
and factorised. thus we get (since we will not need the solutions for b, c, d and g here,
we just give the one for a):

a =(cid:16)  8(pu)2i3m2  4m4i2 + 4m4i3  4(pu)4i2 + 4(pu)4i3 + 8(pu)2m2i2

(d.14)

having a close look at the solution we see what is the problem of setting p = q   = 0
too early. the determinant of the linear system and the denominator in the solutions, resp.,
is zero for this values. therefore we must not set  = 0 but expand the various quantities
involved in powers of . then we will see that all possibly divergent terms cancel and we

59 see footnote 57.

101

are left with nite values for   0. this expansion is rather delicate and we have to pay
attention not to throw away any term too early or even to forget some at all. a crucial thing
with the linear system considered is the fact that it remains dened even if we set  = 0
at the very beginning; we then can reduce the system to four equations and solve it. and
we are in the lucky case that we only need to know a for which we get the same result this
way. but this is not true in general and here it is also wrong for the other variables b, etc.
to do these things we introduce some notation: set ~ =: |vece with   r,   1, ~e 
r, ~2
e = 1, so that the limit in m,   0, can be discussed as an ordinary limit in r,   0.
pay attention to the fact that 0 depends on ~ through q2 = (p  )2 = m2. we have
). thus 0 is not simply proportional to ! this has to be
investigated for ~q 6= 0 and ~q = 0 separately. but considering the rst case it will be clear
that the second follows by simply setting ~q = 0.
since the more direct but in general wrong method of setting p = q at the beginning
leads to the same result we will not present here a detailed derivation of the calculations. we
just give the general direction: all quantities involved in the numerator and denominator
of a have to be expanded in  up to a suitable order. especially the integrals i2, ..., i5 have
to be expanded. this is a tedious but strightforward task. we emphasize especially the
following: the structure of a is

0 = p0  p0q1  ( 2~p~

now we expand the numerator, identify which term of a has to be known up to which

order and calculate it straightforward. this leads to

e the cross section with general mixed states

the cross section involving the initial state (3.109) and the corresponding mixture for the
nal state reads as follows (0,1 and 2 in the matrix elements stand for contributions
with zero, one or two bremsstrahlungs photons involved, the sums run from 1 to 4 and the
k1, ...-integrations over k1, ...  0.
ms indicates the mass shell and msi a small part
of the mass shell centered around p. b+ in the nal state is always understood with the
momentum p, in the initial one with momentum q.):

the products of identical -distributions showing up in some terms of this formula indicate
that we should have done this calculation using wave packets instead of sharp momentum
states in the description of the asymptotic states. since the products of zero- and two-bs
contributions play no role in our discussion since they are nite (cf. sec. 3.4.3), we will not
do this here explicitly, we just state that the analogous calculation involving wave packets
leads to the same result with only one of the identical s in each term. thus we throw away
one of them in the expression above.
