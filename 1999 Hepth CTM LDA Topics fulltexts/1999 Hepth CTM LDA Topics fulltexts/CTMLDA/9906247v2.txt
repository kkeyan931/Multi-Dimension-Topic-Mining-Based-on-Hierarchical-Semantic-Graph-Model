abstract

three-string junctions are allowed congurations in ii b string theory which

preserve one-fourth supersymmetry. we obtain the 11-dimensional supergravity

solution for curved membranes corresponding to these three-string junctions.

in the last few years, there has been lot of interest on three-string junctions in type ii
b string theory [1]- [7]. it was orginally postulated by schwarz that string theory can also
admit multi-junction/multi-pronged strings as fundamental objects [1]. in ref. [2], it has
been shown that the gauge eld congurations in f -theory on k3 for exceptional groups
can be accounted only if multi-pronged strings besides the usual strings (two-pronged)
are included as solutions in string theory. the one-fourth bps nature of three-string
junction was conjectured in [1] and proven in [3, 4]. these three-pronged strings/three-
string junction connecting three d3-branes gives understanding of 1
4-th bps states of the
su(3) super yang-mills theory on the coincident three- d3-branes[5, 6] and their su(n)
generalisations presented in ref. [7].

with enough evidence for such a junction conguration to be present in string theory,
it is very essential that these junctions emerge as exact solution of supergravity eld
equations. till date, attempts in 10-dimensions have failed due to the singular nature
at the junction. the hope is that smoothening the junction would help in nding the
solution. hence, we look at curved membranes in m-theory corresponding to three-string
junctions in ii b theory. the supergravity solution for planar membranes corresponding
to fundamental strings [8] gives us some idea in solving the curved case. the solutions
obtained after the forthcoming (tedious) calculations are given in eqns.(61, 62).

the two dimensional membrane corresponding to three-string junction is given by

holomorphic curve [9]:

f (u, v) = q(u  1)(v  2) q12 = 0 ,

(1)

where u and v are functions of complex coordinates u and v in r2  t 2.

we begin by making an ansatz for the 11-dimensional metric gm n respecting so(6)

symmetry and gauge elds am n p ( m, n, p = 0, 1, . . . 10)

ds2 = a0(u, u, v, v, r)dt2 + 2g(u, u, v, v, r)dxdx + a1(u, u, v, v, r)
a = a0(u, u, v, v, r)dx0  dx  dx ,

where the indices with hat refers to tangent space index distinguishing them from world
volume indices. the arbitrary functions ais and three-form components must be reduced

to fewer number of unknowns by requiring that the eld conguration (2, 3) preserve
one-fourth supersymmetry. in other words, there must exist killing spinors satisfying

dm  = 0

where dm is the supercovariant derivative appearing in the gravitino supersymmetry
transformation,

m = dm ,

and s with world volume index can be converted to tangent space index using vielbeins.
we will split the 11-dimensional  matrix respecting s0(6) symmetry in the following

way:

where   and a are the d = 5 and d = 6 dirac matrices and

 a = (i   7, 1  a)

satisfying the following properties:

7 = 56 . . .  10 .

0uuvv = i ; 2

7 = 1

(10)

(11)

(12)

to simplify the computations, we shall rst impose the following constraints on 

u = 0 ; v = 0 ; 7 = i ,

(13)

which in the 11-dimensions gives one-fourth bps nature of the curved membranes corre-
sponding to three-string junction-viz.,

125 . . . 10 =  ,

345 . . . 10 =  .

there are at least three solutions solving eqns. (32- 51).

where the hodge star operation  is done on the r2  t 2 space. the three-form potential

this restricted class includes holomorphic curves f = pu + qv representing planar mem-
branes corresponding to (p, q) strings in iib theory which preserve half supersymmetry.
the membrane solution for f = u and f = v agrees with the results in ref.[8].

where 0 is a constant and h1(r), h2(r) are harmonic functions dependent only on the
transverse coordinates common to both the branes. these solutions are meaningful only
if u, v are compact coordinates with the charges being smeared over the branes.

(a) for a coordinate transformation u = x1 + ix4 ; v = x2 + ix3, the usual kaluza-
klein reduction along x3 on the above metric and t-duality along x4 gives the following
ten-dimensional string metric:

this represents delocalised solution for orthogonal intersection of fundamental string along
x2 and d string along x1.

(b) for another coordinate transformation u = (z12  1z2) , v = z2, where z1 =
x1 + ix4, z2 = x2 + ix3, we obtain the following metric after dimensional reduction along
x3 and t -duality along x4:

f-strings and d-strings directed along (0, 1) and (2, 1) in the (x1, x2) plane.

1 . this solution is the simplest planar network of

general planar network involving [p1, q1], [p2, q2] strings can be similarly obtained using
the coordinate transformation : u = p1(2z1  1z2)  q1z2 , v = q2z2  p2(2z1  1z2).
the equivalence of delocalised orthogonal intersecting strings with general planar net-
work of strings is expected because the delocalised solution in m-theory (58) has no

7

information about the intersection point or the subspace containing the two m2-branes.
hence eqn. (58) also represent delocalised solutions for the membrane corresponding to
general planar network of strings.

in order to distinguish the intersecting membranes from curved membranes corre-
sponding to three-string junction, we have to look for fully or partially localised solutions.

3) arbitrary membranes including those corresponding to three-string junction

the embedding of the membrane (1) in the metric can be seen by performing the following
holomorphic coordinate tranformation with unit jacobian:

(u, v)  (, ) ,

(66)

.

u  1
v  2

where  = q(u  1)(v  2)

the membrane surface in the new coordinate is f =   12. this membrane is

dierent from the intersecting membranes given by u = 1; v = 2. we hope to see this
dierence from partially or fully localised supergravity solution.

we are now left with the task of determining the form of k from the equations of
motion for three-form gauge eld in the presence of the curved membrane as the source:

m (gf m u v w ) +

1152

u v w m n op qrst fm n op fqrst = j u v w (x) =

(67)

where the membrane action is

smembrane = t z d3{deth

abcax m bx n cx p am n p} .

(68)

8

here hab = ax m bx n gm n is the induced metric on the membrane.

choosing 0 = t, 1 = , 2 = , we obtain the three-form current for the holomorphic

membrane f to be

j 0  =

t

g

2(f )6(xm) .

(69)

substituting the 3-form potential and metric (61, 62) respecting one-fourth supersymme-
try, we get

where

 (2h + mnmnk) = j

j =   j 0 qdetg .

(70)

(71)

the above non-linear equation cannot be solved analytically. perturbative approach over
minkowskian backgrounds gives integral representation for k which is dependent on j
[12]. since juu = 2(u)6(r), jvv = 2(v)6(r) for the intersecting membranes is dierent
from that of the curved membranes, the integrands of the integral representation for k
are distinct. the goal to obtain explicit closed form expression for localised or partially
localised solution from the integral representation is still unsolved.

it has been shown, for certain classes of orthogonal intersections and holomorphic
curves, that the perturbation theory breaks down when there are more than three trans-
verse dimensions [12]. this breakdown of the perturbation theory suggests that no such
fully localized solutions exist with asymptotically at boundary conditions. however,
perturbation theory suggests that such solutions do exist when there are less than three
transverse dimensions. so, for suciently smeared versions of the sources, one expects
that the solutions could be obtained numerically even if an exact analytic form cannot be
found.

it is not clear at this stage whether perturbation theory over other backgrounds like
planar membrane background would help in nding a closed form expression. we hope
to pursue this isssue in future.

the fully localised or partially localised supergravity solutions is also needed to under-
stand the map of bulk parameters to boundary gauge theory parameters to prove ads-
cft correspondence. such near-horizon or ads metric for intersecting branes [13, 14]
and intersecting m5-branes [15] corresponding to ns5-d4 branes in ii a theory [16] has
been obtained.

the procedure elaborated for one-fourth bps states can be generalised to construct
supergravity solution for other non-planar networks [17, 18]. the challenging problem of

9

nding closed form expression for localised/partially localised solutions still remains.
