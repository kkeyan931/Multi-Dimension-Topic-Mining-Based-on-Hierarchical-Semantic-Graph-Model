abstract

recently, it has been conjectured that supergravity solutions with two asymptotically
ads5 regions describe the rg ow of a 4-d eld theory from a uv xed point to
an interacting ir xed point. in this paper we lend support to this conjecture by

showing that, in the uv (ir) limit, the two-point function of a minimally coupled
scalar eld depends only on the uv (ir) region of the metric, asymptotic to ads5.
this result is consistent with the interpretation of the radial coordinate of anti de

sitter space as an energy scale, and it may provide an analog of the callan-symanzik
equation for supergravity duals of strongly coupled eld theories.

the duality between gauge theories and (super)string geometries, rst proposed for conformal

eld theories [1, 2, 3], also holds in a more general setting. particularly interesting is the case
when the superstring geometry is only asymptotically ads5. this setting describes 4-d gauge
theories that are (super)conformal only in the ultraviolet. in the infrared, they may conne
and/or screen charges [4, 5, 6], or reduce to another conformal eld theory [7, 8, 9]. the 5-d

metric that describes the latter case has two regions, respectively far and close to the brane,
where the metric is asymptotically ads5. the interpolating metric is still invariant under the
4-d poincare group and it reads [8]:

ds2 = e2(z)(dz2 + dxdx),

 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).

for small z (far from the brane) the prefactor in the metric has the following expansion:

(z) =  log(cid:18) z

ru v (cid:19) + o(z).

here, ru v is the radius of the far ads region. for large z the expansion is, instead:

(z) =  log(cid:18) z

rir(cid:19) + o(1/z).

(1)

(2)

(3)

in ref. [8] it was shown that an interpolating metric as in eq. (1) exists, and that it describes

mass deformations of n=4 su(n) super-yang mills theory. the metric was shown to exist
using some general properties of type iib, 5-d, gauged supergravity [10, 11]. the proof given

in ref. [8] does not rely heavily on specic properties of gauged supergravity, and it is valid also
in a more general context; in type 0 strings, for instance.

the interpolating metric was interpreted as describing the renormalization group ow from
an uv n=4 superconformal theory to an ir conformal theory. this interpretation is suggested
by the uv/ir connection [5, 12, 13], i.e. by the identication of the ads5 coordinate,z, with
an appropriate length scale in the 4-d eld theory.

a problem with a direct interpretation of the equations of motion of gauged supergravity as

rg equations is that they are second order, instead of rst order. this seems to suggest that z
cannot be identied with the renormalization scale of the 4-d eld theory. purpose of this paper

is to prove that this identication is nevertheless correct, namely, that the ir physics of the
boundary eld theory is essentially independent of z. this will be proven by nding an analog
of the callan-symanzik equation of eld theory, that describes the change of the two-point

function of a composite operators under change of the uv cuto. this equation will show, that
the low-momentum limit of the two-point function is only sensitive to the ir region of the 5-d

geometry i.e. the region close to the brane. we will also show that the high-momentum limit
of the two-point function is sensitive only to the uv region of the 5-d geometry.

1

let us start by recalling that in the geometry dual of eld theory the two-point function of

a composite operator, o(x), with source (x) is found as follows2.

1. the eld  is promoted to a 5-d eld (x, z). it obeys some boundary conditions, given
in refs. [2, 3]. here we nd it convenient to follow the prescription of ref. [2], and to choose
as boundary conditions at small z a plane 4-d wave: (x) = exp(ikx).

(x, z) = eikx

k(z), k(z)|z= = 1,

lim
z

k(z) = 0, kk  k2 > 0.

(4)

a few comments are in order here. a) here  is an uv regulator, and must be chosen
much smaller than any other length scale in the problem, in particular, k  1. b) when
k2 < 0 the boundary condition at large z is k(z)  exp(i|k|z + ikx). c) if the 5-d
geometry is not ads5 at large z, but rather it develops a singularity at nite z = a, then
the boundary condition at a is that k(z) is regular near z = a. in this paper, we set
aside the latter possibility, and assume that the large-z geometry of the 5-d space obeys
eq. (3).

2. the 5-d eld k(z) obeys free scalar equation of motion:

hzz  3z(z)z + k2 + e2(z)m 2(z)i k(z) = 0.

(5)

here, z(z)  z(z). the square-mass term m 2(z) becomes constant both in the ir and
in the uv

m 2(z) = m 2

u v ,

lim

m 2(z) = m 2

ir.

(6)

generically, m 2

u v 6= m 2
ir.

3. finally, the two-point function a(k2) = r d4x exp(ikx)ho(x)o(0)i is given by [2]

.

(7)

a(k2) = he3(z)

k(z)zk(z)i

k(z) #
  "e3(z) zk(z)



the latter form of a(k2) is independent of the normalization condition at z = , and it is
valid whenever k(z) obeys the correct boundary condition at z = .

we want to prove, rst of all, that the low-momentum behavior of a(k2) is insensitive to

the small-z region of the 5-d geometry.

the key to the proof is a rst-order equation for the two-point function, somewhat reminis-

cent of the callan-symanzik equation. using eq. (5), and dening

2here, for simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to minimally-coupled scalar elds.

a(k2, z) = e3(z)z log [k(z)] ,

(8)

2

one nds the equation:

za(k2, z) = e3(z)a2(k2, z)  k2e3(z)  m 2(z)e5(z).

(9)

notice that the boundary conditions at large z ensure that limz a(k2, z) = 0. the two-point
function plays the role of the initial condition for eq. (9):

a(k2, ) = a(k2).

(10)

notice that, analogously to the callan-symanzik equation, eq. (9) does not x the value of

the two-point function: that comes from solving the second-order equation eq. (5), subject to
the boundary conditions given in eq. (4). eq. (9) describes instead the evolution of a quantity,
a(k2, z) that coincides with the true two-point function at small z.

it is tempting to interpret a(k2, z) as the two-point function computed with a cuto z. this
is indeed true if for low momenta, k  0, a(k2, z) diers from a(k2) by at most a multiplicative
factor, and an additive factor either polynomial in k2 or of higher order in the k2 expansion:

a(k2, z) = z 2(z)a(k2) + p (k2, z) + ohk2z2a(k2)i , kz  1.

(11)

the multiplicative factor z 2(z) is interpreted as the wave-function renormalization of the oper-
ator o(x). the polynomial p (k2, z) changes only the contact terms in the two-point function,
without aecting its behavior at non-coincident points. the last term is negligible in the infrared
limit.

notice that, whenever eq. (11) holds, the dependence of the two-point function on the uv
geometry, i.e. the small-z region, is completely factored into contact terms and a wave-function
renormalization constant. in eld theory, the same can be said verbatim for the dependence of

the two-point function on the uv cuto. therefore, if eq. (11) holds, the coordinate z plays
exactly the role of a length cuto. this is another manifestation of the uv/ir connection

for non-conformal theories. more interestingly, eq. (11) says that in geometries with two ads
regions, as in the examples in refs. [8, 9], the infrared behavior of the 4-d theory is completely
described by the ir ads5 geometry, given in eqs. (1,3). to study the ir, one can ignore the
behavior of the metric in the uv region kz > 1. as a concrete application of this result,
the quantity m 2
ir is related to the ir scaling dimension of o, ir, by the standard ads
formula [2, 3, 14]

ir = 2 + q4 + m 2

(12)

eq. (11) is easily proven. it is sucient to notice that a(k2, z) is a smooth function of the
initial conditions a(k2). this is a standard property of ordinary diererential equations with
smooth coecients, as eq. (11). a proof of this theorem can be found in [15].

we are interested in the k-dependence of a(k2, z). smoothness in the initial conditions (and
z) implies a(k2, z) = f (a(k2), z, k2), with f (a, z, k2) a smooth function of a, z and k2. the
eld-theory interpretation of a(k2) tells us that the small-k2 expansion of a(k2) reads 3

a(k2) = a(0) + q(k2) + ck2ir4 + o(k2ir2).

(13)

here c is a nonzero constant, positive by unitarity of the 4-d ir theory; q(k2) is a polynomial
in k2, vanishing at k2 = 0.

by expanding a(k2, z) near the initial condition a(0) we nd

a(k2, z) = f (a(0), z, k2) +

f
a

(a, z, k2)|a=a(0)[a  a(0)] + o{[a  a(0)]2}

= f (a(0), z, 0) + r(k2, z) +

f
a

(a, z, 0)|a=a(0)[a  a(0)] +

+on[a  a(0)]2 , [a  a(0)]2k2o ,

(14)

where r(k2, z) is a polynomial in k2, vanishing at k2 = 0. eq. (11), with z 2 = f/a|a=a(0),
follows immediately from the expansion in eq. (13) and the smoothness of f (a, z, k2).

positivity of the wave-function renormalization z is proven as follows. by analytic continu-
ation in k2, a(k2, z) becomes an analytic function with a cut along the real negative axis. by
its denition, given in eq. (8), it obeys a(k2 , z) = a(k2, z). by splitting eq. (9) into real and
imaginary part, we nd the equation

zim a(k2, z) = 2e3(z)re a(k2, z)im a(k2, z).

(15)

expanding its solution near k2 = 0 we nd 4, thanks to eq. (13):

im a(k2, z) = e2r z



e3(w)re a(0,w)dwc sin(4ir)k2ir4 + o(k2ir2).

(16)

from this equation, it follows that the wave-function renormalization factor is positive:

z(z) = er z



e3(w)re a(0,w)dw.

(17)

after having studied the ir limit of the two-point function, we want to study the opposite
limit, namely k2  . we want to show that, in this limit, a(k2) can be computed by
approximating the metric (1) with its uv ads form, given in eq. (2). we shall do so by writing
eq. (5) in the form of an integral equation and studying its jost solution in the limit k2  .

3here we write the expression valid for generic, non-integer ir. for integer ir, the non-analytic term

reads k2(ir2) log k2.

4again, we write an equation valid for non-integer ir. it is trivial to see that the equation for ir integer

gives the same result for the z factor.

let us write (z) in the form

(z) =  log(cid:18) z

ru v (cid:19) + h(z),

where h(z) has properties

h(z) = o(z)

for z  0, h(z) = log(cid:18) rir

ru v (cid:19) + o(1/z)

for z  .

by writing k = e 1

function, we can write eq. (20) (or eq. (5)) in the form of an integral equation. let k(z) =

we can see, therefore, that in the k2   limit the two-point function can be written as
(47)

a(k2) = z 2()aads(k2) (1 + o(1/k)) ,

where z 2() = e3h() depends on interpolating metric, but not on k.

in summary, in this paper we have shown how greens functions of composite operators in
geometry duals of strongly coupled gauge theories can be computed in the ir and uv limit. we

have found the pleasant result that the ir behavior of the greens functions depends only on
the near-brane geometry. we have also checked that, in all theories that are uv asymptotic

to n=4, 4-d super yang-mills, the uv greens functions are universal.

it would be interesting to see if this result can be strenghtened to include the case when string
corrections to classical gravity become important. it would be also important to see whether

the formal similarity between eq. (9) and the callan-symanzik equation is an accident, or it
suggests instead a way of writing the c-s equation in geometry duals of gauge theories.
