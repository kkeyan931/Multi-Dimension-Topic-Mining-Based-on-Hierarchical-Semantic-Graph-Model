abstract

recently, a new constraint on the structure of a wide class of strongly
coupled eld theories has been proposed. it takes the form of an inequality
limiting the number of degrees of freedom in the infrared description of a
theory to be no larger than the number of underlying, ultraviolet degrees of
freedom. here we apply this inequality to chiral gauge theories. for some
models we nd that it is always satised, while for others we nd that the
assumption of the validity of the inequality implies a strong additional restric-
tion on the spectrum of massless composite particles.

i. introduction

strongly coupled quantum eld theories play a central role in the description of nature
at the most fundamental level. quantum chromodynamics describes the observed strong
interactions, and other strongly interacting theories are part of many eorts to extend the
standard model. but strongly coupled eld theories are notoriously dicult to analyze
directly. because of this, general constraints on their behavior can be very useful.

in a recent paper [1], a new general constraint on strongly coupled eld theories was
it takes the form of an inequality limiting the number of massless degrees of
proposed.
freedom in the infrared description of a eld theory to be no larger than the number of
ultraviolet degrees of freedom. this inequality was conjectured to apply to all asymptotically
free theories (those governed by a free ultraviolet xed point), whose infrared behavior is
also governed by a xed point, not necessarily free. it was noted that the inequality can also
apply to certain theories with interacting ultraviolet xed points.

the inequality is formulated using nite temperature as a device to probe all energy
scales, with the degree-of-freedom count dened using the free energy of the eld theory.
the zero-temperature theory of interest is characterized using the quantity fir, related to
the free energy by

fir

(1)

where t is the temperature and f is the conventionally dened free energy per unit volume
(which is equal to minus the pressure). this limit will be well dened if the theory has an
infrared xed point. for the special case of an infrared-free theory, fir is simply the number
of massless bosonic degrees of freedom plus 7/8 times the number of massless fermionic
degrees of freedom. the corresponding expression in the large t limit is

just as in the infrared, this limit will be well dened if the theory has an ultraviolet xed
point. for an asymptotically free theory, fu v counts the underlying, ultraviolet degrees of
freedom in a similar way.

in terms of these quantities, the conjectured inequality for asymptotically-free theories is

for several strongly coupled, vector-like gauge theories. 1

in the present paper, we extend this study to chiral gauge theories. these theories,
in which the left- and right- handed fermions couple dierently to the gauge elds, are
potentially important examples of strongly coupled gauge eld theories. the motivation for
the eort to understand better the nonperturbative behavior of chiral gauge theories stems
not just from their eld-theoretic interest, but also from their possible application to physics
beyond the standard model, including (i) models of particle substructure that can produce
massless composite fermions and hence account for the fact that the observed fermions have
masses much smaller than the lower bound on a hypothetical compositeness scale, and (ii)
dynamical symmetry breaking of electroweak and higher symmetries. a key feature is that
the fermion content is subject to an additional constraint not present in vectorial gauge
theories, namely the absence of gauge and global 4 (witten) anomalies (and the absence
of mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies, if one includes gravity). this greatly reduces the
number of models that one can consider. on the other hand, a number of powerful techniques
that one can use for vectorial gauge theories are absent for chiral gauge theories; these include
correlation function inequalities (since the fermion measure is not positive). there are also
complications in trying to formulate chiral gauge theories on the lattice because of fermion
doubling. nevertheless, one can still use the t hooft global anomaly matching conditions
[2] as well as large-n methods.

for asymptotically free chiral theories, a variety of infrared phenomena can be consistent
with global anomaly matching. one possibility is that as in qcd the gauge symmetry
remains intact but the theory connes and the global avor symmetries break spontaneously.
another possibility is that connement sets in but that the global symmetries are unbroken.
this is realized by the formation of gauge singlet, massless composite fermions, along with
other possible degrees of freedom. it is also possible that the theory does not conne but is
governed in the infrared by an interacting xed point, possibly weak. the symmetries will
again remain unbroken. yet another well-known possibility is that these theories dynamically
break their own gauge symmetries, e.g., by the formation of fermion condensates. each of
these possibilities except the last will play a role here.

we examine several anomaly-free chiral gauge theories. some of these are automatically

1while the xed points are necessary to ensure the existence of the limits eqs. (1,2), one can imagine
applying the inequality when the ultraviolet xed point is only approximate, that is when it is a feature of
an eective low energy theory. fu v would then count degrees of freedom for energy scales much larger than
masses and connement or symmetry breaking scales in the eective theory, but much smaller than the scale
of new physics.

asymptotically free. for the others, we restrict the number of fermion representations so
that they are asymptotically free. the quantity fu v may then be computed perturbatively.
we consider the possible infrared realizations of the theories as allowed by global anomaly
matching and large-n methods, and compute fir. for some models, the inequality is auto-
matically satised, while for others the assumption of the validity of the inequality provides
a strong restriction on the infrared realization.

ii. su(n ) models

we begin with models based on the gauge group su(n) [3,4]. for all the models consid-

ered in this paper, the beta function is generically written as

 = 

d
d

= 1(cid:16) 2

2(cid:17)  2(cid:16) 3

42(cid:17) + o(4) ,

(4)

where the terms of order 4 and higher are scheme-dependent.

the rst model contains massless fermions transforming according to (i) a symmetric ten-
sor representation of su(n), s = (ab)
l , and (ii) n +4 conjugate fundamental representations
f c
il = a
il, where a, b are su(n) group indices, i = 1, .., n +4 is a avor index, and all fermion
elds are written as left-handed weyl elds. the -function coecients are 1 = 3n  2,
so that the theory is asymptotically free, and 2 = (1/4)(13n 2  30n + 1 + 12n 1). since
the theory is asymptotically free, fu v is given by the free-eld count of the thermodynamic
degrees of freedom:

fu v = 2(n 2  1) + (7/4)[(1/2)n(n + 1) + (n + 4)n] .

(5)

to determine fir, we assume that the theory connes and apply the t hooft anomaly
matching conditions. the global avor symmetry group is gf = su(n + 4)  u(1), where
the su(n + 4) mixes the (n + 4) f c
i elds and the u(1) is the linear combination of the
original u(1)s generated by s  eis s and f c  eif c f c that is left invariant by instantons.
the anomaly matching conditions are consistent with the hypothesis that the global
avor symmetry group gf is unbroken and the massless spectrum is comprised of gauge-
singlet composite fermions transforming according to the antisymmetric second-rank tensor
representation of gf . in the large-n limit, it has in fact been argued [4] that this is the
infrared spectrum of the theory. from this spectrum one can determine that

f  fu v  fir = (1/4)[15n 2 + 7n  50] ,

(7)

which is positive for all n  2. the inequality is automatically satised.

the second model contains massless fermions in (i) the antisymmetric tensor representa-
l and, if n  5, also (ii) n 4 conjugate fundamental representations
il, where i = 1, ..., n  4. for the beta function, we have 1 = 3n + 2 > 0, and

f c
il = a
2 = (1/4)(13n 2 + 30n + 1  12n 1). since the theory is asymptotically free, we nd

fu v = 2(n 2  1) +

4h n(n  1)

2

+ (n  4)ni .

(8)

for n  6, the global symmetry group is gf = su(n  4)  u(1), where the su(n  4)
mixes the n  4 elds f c
i and the u(1) is the linear combination of the original u(1)s
generated by a  eiaa and f c  eic
f f c that is left invariant by instantons. the anomaly
matching conditions are consistent with the conclusion that the massless spectrum consists
of gauge-singlet composite fermions transforming according to the symmetric second-rank
tensor representation of gf . (in the degenerate case, n = 4, there are no massless fermions.)
from this spectrum, we deduce that

whence

fir =

(n  4)(n  3)

2

.

f = (1/4)[15n 2  7n  50] ,

(9)

(10)

which is positive for the relevant range n  4. the inequality is again satised.

the third model is an extension of model 1 with the same gauge group and fermions
l ; (ii) n + 4 conjugate fun-
il, where i = 1, ..., n + 4; and (iii) p pairs of fundamental

transforming as (i) a symmetric tensor representation s = (ab)
damental representations: f c
and conjugate fundamental representations fil, f c

i = c

il, i = 1, ..., p.

we have 1 = 3n  2  (2/3)p and 2 = (1/4){13n 2  30n + 1 + 12/n  2p((13/3)n 

1/n)}. hence, the theory is asymptotically free if

we shall restrict p so that this condition is satised. we then nd

p < (9/2)n  3 .

fu v = 2(n 2  1) +

the global symmetry group is

gf = su(r)  su(p)  u(1)  u(1)

where

r = n + 4 + p .

(13)

(14)

the rst u(1) in (13) is generated by fil  eifil and f c
il, which is a vectorial
symmetry and hence is not aected by instantons; the u(1) is the one left invariant by
instantons. the anomaly matching conditions are consistent with the suggestion [5] that the
spectrum of the model consists of gauge-singlet massless composite fermions transforming
according to the representations

il  eif c

(

)

(15)

of su(r)  su(p) in gf .

for simplicity, we will restrict our discussion to the large-n limit. it was noted in ref.
[4] that the above composite-fermion realization of gf is not possible if this limit is taken
with xed p. assuming connement, gf would have to be broken to a smaller group. if, on
the other hand, we take the limit

n  ,

p  ,

p
n

 o(1)

(16)

(so that loops of the p fermions are not suppressed), the above realization with unbroken gf
is possible.

we therefore assume the limits in eq. (16), with

for asymptotic freedom, and calculate that

(17)

(18)

where only the leading terms in the limit (16) are relevant. it follows that, keeping only
these leading terms,

f = (15/4)n 2  (7/2)p2 .

hence, in the large-n limit, f > 0 only if  (is nite and) satises

  (cid:16)15

4 (cid:17)1/2

= 1.04 .

5

(19)

(20)

which is a considerably stronger upper bound on p than (17). (for very small   const./n,
we have already noted that this realization is impossible and that gf must break.) thus
there is a nite  range leading to composite fermions and an unbroken gf .

for larger  values, up to the asymptotic freedom limit  = 9/2, we expect the theory
to be in the nonabelian coulomb phase, with an interacting infrared xed point. near the
upper end, the xed point will be weakly interacting as determined by the rst two terms in
the  function. the xed point is then given by  = 21/2, and since 1 > 0, it exists
only if 2 < 0. in the large-n limit, one nds that the two-loop xed point exists if

and its value is

3

<  <

,

n =

8(9  2)
13(2  3)

.

(21)

(22)

of course, the lower end of this range is not reliable since the xed-point coupling, as
determined by the two-loop  function, approaches innity. for  near 9/2, the infrared
and ultraviolet degrees of freedom are the same, and f is positive due to the (negative)
perturbative correction to fir. whether the nonabelian coulomb phase persists down to
the value in eq. (20),  = 1.04, or even lower, is unknown. the inequality says simply that
the conned phase with massless composite fermions and unbroken global symmetry group
gf cannot exist if  > 1.04. the full exploration of the phases of this model as a function
of  is an interesting and unsolved strong-coupling problem.

iii. direct product gauge groups

we next examine a class of models rst discussed by georgi [6] with direct product gauge
groups gk composed by alternating su(n) and su(m) k times, so that g2 = su(n)
su(m), g3 = su(n) su(m) su(n), etc. letting m(n, 1) denote m copies of the
representation (n, 1), we take the fermion content to be

m(n, 1),

( n , m), n(1, m)

for k = 2 ,

m(n, 1, 1),

( n , m, 1),

(1, m, n), m(1, 1, n)

for k = 3 ,

(23)

(24)

m(n, 1, 1, 1), ( n, m , 1, 1), (1, m, n, 1), (1, 1, n, m ), n(1, 1, 1, m) for k = 4 ,

(25)

6

etc. for the ith su(n), (gi) = (g3
(gj) = (g3

j /(482))(11m  2n) + o(g5

j ), so that the theory is asymptotically free if

i /(482))(11n  2m) + o(g5

i ) and for the jth su(m),

which will be assumed henceforth. then

,

fu v = 2[k(n 2  1) + (m 2  1)] + (7/4)(k + 1)mn ,

(26)

(27)

where k =  if k = 2 is even and  + 1 if k = 2 + 1 is odd.

again assuming connement so that the massless, physical states transform as singlets
under gk, one can apply the t hooft anomaly matching conditions. consider rst even
k; then the global avor symmetry group is gf,k even=su(m) su(n) u(1), where the
su(m) mixes the m copies of (n, 1, ..., 1), the su(n) mixes the n copies of (1, ..., m),
and the u(1) is the one left invariant by instantons. the anomaly matching conditions
for the su(n)3, su(m)3, su(m)2u(1), and su(n)2u(1) anomalies are consistent with the
conclusion, also supported by large n, m arguments [4] (with n/m xed in the interval
(26)) that the spectrum consists of massless composite fermions that transform according to
the (m, n) representation of gf . hence, fir, k even = (7/4)mn and

fk even = 2(n 2 + m 2  2) + (7/4)kmn > 0 .

(28)

next consider odd k; then the global avor symmetry group is gf,k odd=su(m)
su(m) u(1), where the two su(m)s mix the m copies of (n, 1, ..., 1) among themselves
and the m copies of (1, ..., n) among themselves, respectively, and the u(1) is as before,
with appropriate charges. anomaly matching conditions and large m, n arguments imply
that gf is spontaneously broken to gdiag. = su(m)v  u(1). hence, the massless spectrum
consists of m 2  1 goldstone bosons, so that fir, k odd = m 2  1 and

fk=2+1 = 2( + 1)(n 2  1) + (2  1)(m 2  1) + (7/2)( + 1)mn > 0 .

(29)

thus, the global symmetry is believed to remain unbroken with massless composite fermions
for even k, and is believed to break, producing goldstone bosons, for odd k. in both cases,
f > 0. the inequality provides no new information about these models.

iv. supersymmetric models

there are a number of chiral n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories for which dual
descriptions are known which are weakly coupled in the ir. it is a nontrivial test of the

7

inequality to check that fir as computed from these duals is indeed less than fu v . we have
performed this check for several chiral supersymmetric theories and found the predictions of
the inequality to be in agreement with the conjectured duals in all cases. the theories we
studied include (i) all so-called s-conning theories as listed in ref. [7]; (ii) an so(10) theory
with chiral superelds transforming according to a spinor and n vector representations [8],
and (iii) an su(n) theory with chiral superelds comprised of a symmetric tensor s and
n + 4 antifundamental representations q [9].

the theory (iii) is the n = 1 supersymmetric version of the model we discussed in the
beginning of section ii (with no tree-level superpotential). this theory is asymptotically
free for all n, and we obtain

fu v =

15

4 (cid:18)n 2  1 +

1
2

n(n + 1) + n(n + 4)(cid:19) .

(30)

in [8] a dual n = 1 supersymmetric description of the ir dynamics of this theory was
proposed. the dual theory is non-chiral and has gauge group so(8), n + 4 copies of the
vector representation of so(8), a spinor of so(8), and (n + 4)(n + 5)/2 + 1 gauge singlets.
for n  13 the dual is ir free and we can calculate fir by simply counting dual elds

fir =

15

4 (cid:18)28 + 8(n + 4) + 8 +

1
2

(n + 4)(n + 5) + 1(cid:19) .

(31)

the constraint fir  fu v then becomes n  9; thus the inequality is satised for all
numbers of avors for which we can reliably compute the quantities fu v and fir.

although we have concentrated on chiral gauge theories in this paper, we add some
remarks here on a particular vectorial gauge theory for which no dual description is known.
as we will see, applying the conjectured inequality yields a new constraint on the ir spectrum
of this theory. the model is an n = 1 supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory with the same
matter content as n = 2 supersymmetric qcd: f chiral superelds qi and qi transforming
in the fundamental and antifundamental representations of su(n) and one chiral supereld
a in the adjoint representation. the dierence with the n = 2 theory is that we do not
include a tree level superpotential term w = gqa q. setting the superpotential coupling to
zero breaks the extended supersymmetry to n = 1 and the resulting theory is much less well
understood. our goal is to investigate how the inequality constrains the infrared dynamics
of this theory.

for f < 2n the theory is free in the ultraviolet, and therefore

fu v =

15

4 (cid:0)2(n 2  1) + 2f n(cid:1) .

8

(32)

a full description of the ir theory is not known, but a few general statements can be made.
the classical scalar potential of this theory has a large number of at directions; the theory
has a moduli space of inequivalent vacua. it is well known that the classical moduli space
can be parametrized in terms of the independent gauge invariant polynomials which in this
case are

tk = trak, k = 2, ..., n and mi = qai q , i = 0, ..., n  1 ,

(33)

in addition to several baryonic gauge invariants. here the tk are singlets, whereas the mi
have f 2 components.

no infrared-free description to this theory has been found, and there are arguments [10]
that the theory at the origin of moduli space remains interacting and is conformal in the
infrared for any value of 0 < f < 2n. still, the inequality can provide useful information,
as we will now discuss.

an interesting picture for the infrared dynamics has been put forward in [11], based on
a study of a closely related sp(2n) theory.
if one assumes that the infrared xed point
corresponds to an interacting superconformal theory, then the superconformal algebra must
contain an anomaly-free u(1)r symmetry. it follows from the superconformal algebra that
the scaling dimensions of all chiral composites are equal to 3/2 times their charge under
the u(1)r. unfortunately, the r-symmetry of our theory is not unique; there exists a one-
parameter family of r-symmetries of which one is the u(1)r in the superconformal algebra.
however one can still derive relations between the scaling dimensions of the chiral composites
mi and tk. the result of such an analysis is that for f < n/2, the scaling dimensions of
some composites, as determined from the superconformal r-charges, drop below the unitarity
bound. this then implies that these composites decouple from the interacting conformal
theory. similar behavior is anticipated for n/2  f < 2n. this picture for the dynamics is
also supported by duality [11]. in summary, we expect that in the deep infrared this theory
splits into disjoint sectors: one sector with an interacting conformal theory, and other sectors
consisting only of a set of m free composite elds mi.

we now apply the inequality to get a constraint on this scenario. to calculate fir we
add the contributions from each of the disjoint sectors. we cannot calculate the contribution
from the conformal sector, but we know that it is positive.2 this allows us to compute a
lower bound on fir by adding only the contributions from the m free elds m0, ..., mm1:

2 it follows from the denition in eq. (1) together with f = p, that fir has the same sign as the pressure,
which is always positive.

(34)

demanding that fir  fu v then gives m  2( n 2
f 2 ). since only the rst n of the
mi are independent gauge invariants, we already have that m  n, so that the inequality
provides new information only for f > 2. the constraint then simplies to

f 2 + n

f  1

m < 2

n
f

(

n

+ 1) .

(35)

we see that for larger f this constraint can be very signicant. for example, for f near the
asymptotic freedom bound at f = 2n we nd m < 3/2, implying that only the rst in the
series of mesons, m0, can decouple from the conformal theory and become a free eld.

the case of su(2) is somewhat special and leads to a tight constraint. for su(2) both q
and q transform in the fundamental doublet representation of su(2), and the global avor
symmetry is enhanced to su(2f ). the mesons m0,1 transform as tensors under this enlarged
avor symmetry. m0 is an antisymmetric tensor, whereas m1 is a symmetric tensor. the
constraint then allows the following scenario: for f  4 the theory is not asymptotically free
and we do not get a constraint; for f = 2, 3 only the meson m0 can decouple and become
free; and for f = 1 both m0 and m1 may be free.

v. summary

in summary, we have performed a quantitative comparison of the ultraviolet and infrared
degrees of freedom, as measured by f = fu v  fir, for several chiral gauge theories and
for one vector-like, supersymmetric gauge theory. we have shown that in some models f
is automatically positive, whereas in others, such as the third model of section ii and the
vector-like, supersmmetric model ( section iv), the conjectured inequality f  0 places
interesting restrictions on the low energy structure of the theory.
