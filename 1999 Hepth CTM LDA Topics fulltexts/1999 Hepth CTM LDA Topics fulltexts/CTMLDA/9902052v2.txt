abstract

the ads/cft conjecture relates quantum gravity on anti-de sitter (ads) space to
a conformal eld theory (cft) dened on the spacetime boundary. we interpret the
cft in terms of natural analogues of the bulk s-matrix. our rst approach nds the
bulk s-matrix as a limit of scattering from an ads bubble immersed in a space admitting
asymptotic states. next, we show how the periodicity of geodesics obstructs a standard
lsz prescription for scattering within global ads. to avoid this subtlety we partition global
ads into patches within which cft correlators reconstruct transition amplitudes of ads
states. finally, we use the ads/cft duality to propose a large n collective eld theory
that describes local, perturbative supergravity. failure of locality in quantum gravity
should be related to the dierence between the collective 1/n expansion and genuine nite
n dynamics.

1. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence states that string theory in anti-de sitter (ads) space-

time is holographically dual to a conformal eld theory (cft) dened on the spacetime

boundary [1-3]. the semiclassical limit of spacetime physics is related to the large n limit

of the cft. semiclassical spacetime physics is generally expected to satisfy the familiar

axioms of locality and causality. on the other hand, some sort of violation of locality is

expected for a holographic quantum gravity that satises the bekenstein bound [4]. for

example, anti-de sitter spacetime locality appears to translate into scale locality in the

dual cft, a property that is certainly absent for nite n [5,6,7]. given holography, we

are therefore faced, nearly inevitably, with violations of locality in semiclassical quantum

gravity.

to investigate the failure of locality, we must understand what data about spacetime

physics are accessible from cft calculations. as summarized in sec. 2, the ads/cft

correspondence equates the anti de-sitter eective action, seen as a functional of bound-

ary data, to the generating functional for correlators of a cft dened on the spacetime

boundary [2,3]. all information available in the cft is contained in these correlation

functions, evaluated in all the possible states of the theory. we will show that these data

reconstruct bulk transition amplitudes.

in ads spacetimes of lorentzian signature, solutions to the free bulk wave equations

can be classied into normalizable and non-normalizable modes encoding, respectively,

the states of the theory and the boundary conditions for elds [8]. a conventional lsz

prescription for spacetime physics would describe transition amplitudes between asymp-

totic states, in terms of truncated green functions integrated against normalizable modes.

ads lore states that asymptotic states cannot be dened, due to the timelike boundary

and the periodicity of geodesics. however, in sec. 3 we will show that the vacuum cor-

relation functions of the dual cft can be given an s-matrix interpretation as a limit of

scattering from an ads bubble immersed in a space admitting asymptotic states. in
poincare coordinates for ads5, this is simply the usual cft interpretation of scattering
from an asymptotically at 3-brane [9,10]. global ads does not arise this way as a limit

of a conventional brane solution. therefore, for interpretational purposes, we construct a

global ads bubble inside a simple asymptotic spacetime. a stable string solution of this

kind is not known. nevertheless, by studying scattering in this spacetime, we will argue

that the cft correlators recover universal features of an s-matrix for scattering in global

ads. interestingly, our interpretation identies certain singularities of the cft correlators

with resonant scattering from the anti de-sitter region.

1

the results of sec. 3 arise because cft correlators are expressed in the bulk as
truncated green functions convolved against non-normalizable modes. in sec. 4 we return
to the issue of normalizable modes, or states localized within ads space, and transitions
between them. we start by showing explicitly that the periodicity of geodesics in ads
obstructs a conventional denition of asymptotic states. thus the lsz prescription is ill-
dened. instead, we partition global ads into poincare patches within which geodesics do
not reconverge. the ads boundary is likewise partitioned, and physics within a given bulk
patch is dual to a cft dened on the corresponding boundary. the in and out states of the
theory on the patch correspond to boundary conditions at early and late times. we show
that transition amplitudes between these states are described by correlation functions of
the dual cft. in the large radius limit for ads, this construction provides a holographic
description of a at space s-matrix. (while this paper was being written we received [11,12]
which contain a related derivation.) the intermediate steps of our discussion rely on the
diagrammatic expansion of the spacetime physics, but we expect that the nal results are
dened in the full theory.

in sec. 5 we attempt to reconstruct local bulk operators from the cft. after reviewing
the n   case where this reconstruction is manifest [6,7], we discuss the problem at
nite n . using a lehmann representation described by dusedau and freedman [13], we
show that nite n bulk operators have a complicated multi-particle structure and that
the cft primaries only capture the single-particle piece. to reconstruct supergravity,
we propose a collective eld theory built from the spectral decomposition of large-n
conformal primaries in the cft. we are able to posit an eective action order by order in
1/n and the string coupling which reproduces local, perturbative spacetime physics after
a simple bessel transformation of collective eld correlators. presumably this collective
eld procedure reproduces the nite n cft at best in a power series. we close with a
discussion of the problems facing reconstruction of local supergravity from the exact nite
n dynamics.

2. review of the ads/cft correspondence

euclidean ads (eads) space is topologically a ball, with the metric:

ds2 =

r2
z2 (dt2 + d~x2 + dz2) .

(2.1)

here b  {t, ~x} spans rd and   z  0 with a boundary at z = 0. the eads/cft
correspondence states [2,3]:

zbulk[(0)] = her

2

dd b 0(b) o(b)i .

(2.2)

here ln zbulk is the eective action for string theory on adsd+1 considered as a functional

of the boundary data 0 for the elds . the right hand side is the generating functional

of correlators of the operator o dual to . for illustration, we will always take  to be a

scalar eld of mass m. then, setting

2h =

(2.3)

regular classical solutions of the free wave equation for  have the boundary behaviour

(b, z) = z2h 0(b) ,

lim
z0

(2.4)

and couple to cft operators o of dimension 2h+. the free classical solution may be

suggestively written in terms of the boundary value 0 and a bulk-boundary propagator
ge

b as [3]:

(x) =z

db ge

b(x, b) 0(b)

(2.5)

with x  {z, t, ~x}. using this expression and (2.2), the cft correlators are given in terms

of truncated bulk green functions as:

ho(b1)o(b2)    o(bn)i =z

n

yi=1(cid:2)dxi ge

b (bi, xi)(cid:3) h(x1)    (xn)it .

(2.6)

the eads diagrams introduced in [3] summarize this computation. in fig. 1 a diametric

slice of eads is displayed, and the thick line is the boundary of the resulting disc. the cft

correlators are then obtained by replacing the legs of ordinary bulk feynman diagrams by
bulk-boundary propagators.1

fig. 1: eads diagrams computing euclidean cft correlators

1 ref. [6] and section 2.3 show that they can also be obtained from the limiting behavior of

bulk diagrams as the external points are taken to the boundary.

3

lorentzian correspondence: the universal cover of lorentzian ads (cads) is topolog-
ically a cylinder, with the metric:

ds2 = r2( sec2  d 2 + sec2  d2 + tan2  d2

d1) .

(2.7)

the boundary of spacetime at  = /2 has the topology sd1  r. a free massive scalar
eld on this background will have regular solutions of the form:

(x) =z db gb(x, b) 0(b) + n(x)

(2.8)

where n is normalizable in the klein-gordon norm and vanishes at the spacetime bound-
ary. the bulk-boundary propagator gb is a solution to the bulk wave equation which ap-
proaches a delta function on the ads boundary. this propagator is ambiguous in lorentzian
ads since we may always add a normalizable solution n to it without changing the bound-
ary behaviour. we will pick the propagator arising via continuation from euclidean ads.
this corresponds to a certain choice of vacuum as discussed in sec. 3. then (2.8) describes
the corresponding general bulk solution that approaches 0 at the boundary.

it was argued in [8] that the normalizable, uctuating solutions n encode the states
of the bulk subject to xed boundary conditions specied by 0. the solutions n provide
a unitary representation of the conformal group that matches the states we expect the dual
operator to create in the boundary cft. in the free limit, classical bulk modes n should
be dual to coherent states in the boundary. in this limit the cads/cft correspondence
is written as [7]:

zcl[(0) + n] = hn|eir

db 0(b) o(b)|ni

(2.9)

where the bulk action is evaluated in the presence of the classical mode n and the cft is
placed in corresponding coherent state |ni. in this limit we do not interpret the compu-
tation diagramatically and instead (semiclassically) evaluate the bulk action by using the
equations of motion. it was shown in [7] that the classical probe n induces expectation
values for operators in the dual cft.

here we are interested in the interpretation of the normalizable modes as asymptotic
states in transition amplitudes for the bulk theory. to have such an interpretation we
must either be able to turn o bulk interactions at early and late times or separate the
wavepackets by large distances. since the eective bulk coupling constant is determined by
the constant string coupling and ads curvature, we are unable to change the asymptotic
strength of the interaction. but in cads it is also not possible to separate wavepackets
asymptotically because of the periodicity of geodesics in spacetime. alternatively, the
normalizable mode solutions of cads have xed temporal periodicity [14,15,16,7]. so,

4

if two wavepackets interact in a near collision and and then appear to separate, they
eventually bounce o the ads eective potential near the boundary and almost collide
again. on the other hand, there should be states in the bulk theory that are dual to the
cft states that arise from operators acting on the vacuum at early and late times. we
will discuss these issues in detail in sec. 4.

for the moment, we will work in the cads vacuum by setting all the modes n to

zero. then the cads/cft correspondence is given by:

z[(0)] = ht eir

db 0(b) o(b)i ,

(2.10)

and the cft vacuum correlators are expressed in terms of truncated bulk green functions
as:

ht o(b1)o(b2)    o(bn)i =z

n

yi=1

[dxi gb (bi, xi)] ht (x1)    (xn)it .

(2.11)

the corresponding cads diagram appears in fig. 2a. once again, a diametric slice of
cads is presented and the thick lines represent the cylindrical ads boundary. in sec. 4
we will discuss how (2.10) is modied to account for the states of ads and transitions
between them. essentially, this will result in cads diagrams with extra legs (fig. 2b, for
example) representing the inuence of in and out states on cft correlators.

fig. 2: cads diagrams computing lorentzian correlators

2.1. the bulk-boundary propagator

we are interested in determining what data about the bulk spacetime are contained in
the cft correlators in (2.11). the rst step is to determine the bulk-boundary propagator
in lorentzian spacetimes.

euclidean propagator: the euclidean bulk-boundary propagator was dened in [3] to
be a solution of the bulk wave equation that approaches a delta function at the boundary.2

2 in practice, calculations are carried out by cutting o eads at z =  and removing this
regulator at the end. in order to obey the cft ward identities we should actually require gb

to approach a delta function at z =  [17].

5

it is more convenient for us to fourier transform with respect to the boundary coordinates

b. then, gb (k, x) must be a solution to the bulk wave equation that is non-singular in

the bulk and is asymptotic to a plane wave at the z = 0 boundary. this gives [17,7]:

gb (k, x) = a zd/2 k(qz) eit+i~k~x .

(2.12)

here a is a normalization factor, k  {, ~k} and q2 = 2 + ~k2. the bessel function k
vanishes exponentially as z   and scales as z at the boundary as z  0.

poincare propagator: we arrive at the poincare patch (pads) of cads by performing

the wick rotation t  it in (2.1):

ds2 =

r2
z2 (dt2 + d~x2 + dz2)

(2.13)

fig. 3a displays a diametric slice of cads as an innite tower of pads patches.3 poincare
observers in each patch see past and future horizons (h , h +) at z =  where the

patches meet. the boundary b at z = 0 of a given patch is conformal to the minkowski

plane. the pads/cft duality relates physics within the poincare patch to a cft dened
on the planar boundary.4 the pads propagator appearing in (2.11) is then obtained by
continuation from (2.12). setting q2 = 2  ~k2 we nd:

gb (k, x) = a zd/2 h (1)

 (qz) eit+i~k~x .

(2.14)

here h is a hankel function, q = pq2 and for spacelike momenta (q2 < 0) we choose
the branch q = ip|q2|. then, for timelike momenta and positive , gb is purely ingoing

at the horizon while for q2 < 0, gb vanishes exponentially at the horizon. for timelike
momenta there is also a spectrum of normalizable mode solutions proportional to j (qz)

[8]. such modes may be added to the bulk-boundary propagator, inducing an outgoing

component at the past horizon. the propagator (2.14) corresponds to a choice of hartle-

hawking vacuum as usual (see e.g. [19]) upon taking a euclidean continuation.

3 see the appendix of [8] for more details.
4 a cft strictly speaking cannot be dened on the minkowski plane. an innite stack of

planes is needed to realize global conformal transformations [18]. this is dual in spacetime to the

realization of the global isometries of cads on an innite tower of poincare patches.

the pads bulk-boundary propagator may also be derived by taking a scaling limit of

the bulk feynman propagator [6]:

gb (b; b, z) = lim
z0

z2h+ gf (b, z; b, z) .

(2.15)

to show this we explicitly construct the bulk feynman propagator from the normalizable
modes given in [8] and nd:5

gb(b1; b2, z2) =zq0

(2.16)

fourier transforming and using bessel function identities to convert the integral over q  0

into an integral over the real line gives:

gb (k; z, b) =

q zd/2

22+ (1 + )

h (1)

 (qz) eikb

(2.17)

in agreement with (2.14). this relation between the bulk feynman propagator and the

bulk-boundary propagator will be useful to us in developing an s-matrix interpretation of

cft correlators.

cads propagator: once again, in global ads we seek a solution to the wave equation

approaching the delta function at the boundary [3,17]. after expanding in spherical har-

monics on the boundary sphere we require a smooth solution with the boundary behaviour

gb  ei yl ~m()(cos )2h

(2.18)

5 here it is important to correctly normalize the bulk modes to 1 in the klein-gordon norm.

7

as   /2, where yl ~m are the spherical harmonics (c.f. [20,21]). the unique solution for
xed {, l, ~m} is (see e.g. [8]):

gb (, l, ~m;, , ) = b ei yl, ~m()

(2h+ + l + ),

, sin2 (cid:19) ,

(2.19)
where b is a normalization constant. for any given l, at the frequencies  = 2h+ + l + 2n
with n = {0, 1,   }, there is a spectrum of normalizable modes that vanish at the boundary.
these may be added to gb without changing the boundary behaviour. to eliminate the
ambiguity, consider the euclidean continuation   i of the cads metric (2.7). the bulk-
boundary propagator in that metric is a smooth solution to an elliptic dierential equation
and is unique given a xed boundary behaviour (2.18). continuing back to lorentzian
signature does not mix spherical harmonics or frequencies, giving (2.19) as the propagator.
the cads propagator (2.19) has singularities at the frequencies  = 2h+ + l + 2n
corresponding to normalizable spacetime states. this is a result of the normalization
condition (2.18). to see this, rewrite the hypergeometric function 2f1 as a function of
cos2  following [8]:

(cos )2h+ (sin )l f1(sin2 ) = c+ (+) + c () ,

(2.20)

where (+) vanishes at the boundary and () achieves the asymptotics (2.18). the
coecients c are given by:6

c =

(l + d

2 )()

(cid:0) 1
2 (2h + l + )(cid:1) (cid:0) 1

2 (2h + l  )(cid:1)

.

(2.21)

we maintain the asymptotics (2.18) by picking b = 1/c. but c vanishes when

 = nl = 2h+ + l + 2n;

n = 0, 1, 2,   

(2.22)

giving a divergence in gb . the divergence is proportional to (+) which, at the magic
frequencies (2.22), are precisely the normalizable states of the bulk theory. in later sections,
we will interpret these singularities in terms of resonant scattering behaviour.

as in poincare coordinates, gb can be derived as a limit of the bulk feynman

propagator in terms of the complete set of modes derived in e.g. [8]:

+

nl ~m(, ) = nnl (cos )2h+ (sin )l p (l1+d/2,2h+d/2)

(2.23)

6 for   z the divergent gamma function in the numerator of c + will be cancelled by a pole

in the denominator of (+).

where nnl is a normalization factor and p k,m
quantized frequencies nl given in (2.22). the feynman propagator is then:

(2.24)

we nd the bulk-boundary propagator by taking one argument to the boundary and

rescaling:

gb (t1, 1; x2) = lim

1/2

(cos 1)2h+gb(x1, x2) .

(2.25)

projecting the resulting propagator onto denite frequencies and angular momenta gives:

gb (, l, ~m; x) =xn

n,lei +
nl ~m(, )
n 
2
nl  2  i

(2.26)

where n  is a normalization factor. note that when   nl, the nth term in the sum
dominates with an innite coecient. we then get a pole factor times +
nl ~m, replicating
the resonant behaviour described above.

3. scattering from an ads bubble

we are now prepared to interpret the cft correlators from the spacetime perspective.
begin by fourier transforming the vacuum correlators of the cft in (2.11). let (x) be
the transformed bulk-boundary propagator with   k = {, ~k} in poincare coordinates,
and   {, l, ~m} in cads. then (2.11) becomes:

ht o1(1)    on(n)i =z

n

yk=1

dxk 1 (x1)    n(xn) ht (x1)    (xn)it .

(3.1)

the left hand side of this expression is simply the fourier transform of a cft correlator.
here  is given by the mode solutions (2.14) and (2.19) in pads and cads respectively.
so the right side of (3.1) looks just like an lsz formula for an s-matrix element: it is a

truncated bulk green function, with its legs projected onto on-shell wavefunctions.

nevertheless, (3.1) is not giving us a conventional lsz prescription for ads states. as

observed in sec. 2, the notion of asymptotic states in cads in problematic because of the

reconvergence of geodesics. we will make this observation precise in sec. 4 and show that

conventional transition amplitudes may only be dened for suitable trucations of cads.
regardless, the modes  appearing in (3.1) are simply not the states of the theory. for

9

general  these modes have innite action and do not uctuate, a property related to their
divergence near the innite volume ads boundary [8].7

the expansion of the bulk-boundary propagator in terms of normalizable modes pro-

vides an important clue to the spacetime interpretation of (3.1). we will argue in sec. 4

that a disturbance created at the ads boundary at a given time can be resolved into a

sum of normalizable modes at a later time. this is dual to a statement that propagating

states are produced in the cft by operators acting at early times. in sec. 4 we will use

this fact to interpret (3.1) in terms of a transition amplitude for states in a temporal ads

box (a temporally truncated anti-de sitter patch).

here we pursue a complementary interpretation in terms of a spatial ads bubble.

the bulk-boundary propagator is explicitly constructed to transport the inuence of dis-

turbances of the ads boundary into the interior of the bubble. so (3.1) summarizes the

response of the ads bubble to measurements by an observer external to the bubble. more

generally, imagine a large bubble of ads space inside an asymptotically at spacetime.

(the bubble might be metastable and could eventually dissipate.) a strong form of the

holographic proposal says that quantum gravity inside any volume should be described by

a theory living on the boundary of the volume [4]. we then expect the large ads bubble

to be described by a cft living on its boundary. an experimentalist probing the bubble

can make widely separated wavepackets and focus them to enter the bubble, where they

interact. the s-matrix for this scattering process should be described by correlation func-

tions of the cft. of course, the elds would have to be suitably normalized to reect the

probability that the wavepackets penetrate the ads region. but the non-trivial part of

the scattering process is precisely summarized by (3.1). we will develop examples of this

bubble interpretation, displayed in fig. 4, in the remainder of this section.

fig. 4: scattering from an ads bubble; here the dark lines denote a nite

distance boundary

7 actually, in cads  is normalizable at the magic frequencies (2.22), but, as discussed in

sec.2.1, it has a divergent coecient and cannot be thought of as an ads state.

10

3.1. s-matrix: poincare coordinates

in poincare coordinates for ads5, a convenient example of a bubble geometry is pro-
vided by the asymptotically at 3-brane. this spacetime has an asymptotically at region
that patches onto an ads throat. the duality of the bubble to a cft accounts for the
success of cft computations of supergravity scattering from 3-branes. this interpretation
has been extensively explored in the work on brane and black hole greybody factors (e.g.,
[22]) and led directly to the formulation of the ads/cft correspondence in [2]. so we will
only review the outlines of the argument here, and a pose a puzzle regarding modes with
spacelike momenta.

the asymptotically at, extremal 3-brane has a metric

ds2 = h 1/2 (dt2 + d~x2) + h 1/2 (dr2 + r2 d2
5)

(3.2)

with h = 1 + r4/r4, r4 = 4g2n and a horizon at r = 0. when r  r we can set
h  r4/r4. then taking z = r2/r as the new radial coordinate yields poincare ads5.
alternatively, when r  r, h  1 giving at space.

consider a massless scalar  satisfying the free wave equation in this background.
supergravity calculations of the scattering of this scalar from the ads region will be valid
when the 3-brane scale is large and incident energy small compared to the string scale.
this was formalized in a double scaling limit as [9,10]:

r4/2  gn  

;

2  0 .

then setting  = ei~k~xit ylm()  gives:

(cid:20)(cid:18)1 +

r5 rr5r(cid:21)  = 0 .

(3.3)

(3.4)

euclidean ads enjoys the same wave equation with 2 replaced by 2.

timelike momenta: when q2 = 2  ~k2 > 0 solutions in the near and far region are
bessel functions. we want a scattering solution that is pure infalling at the brane horizon
at r = 0 (or z =  in the inverted ads coordinate) and is smooth in the far region. so
we choose:

near :   z2 h (1)

l+2(qz)

;

far :   r2 jl+2(qr)

(3.5)

with z = r2/r and match these solutions at r  r.8 the bulk-boundary propagator in
(2.14) now appears as the infalling disturbance created by a probe from the asymptotic

8 in fact, the wave equation can be solved exactly in the 3-brane background in terms of

mathieu functions [23].

11

region. the cft correlators in (3.1) then describe the non-trivial interaction of these
disturbances in the ads region. pure ingoing boundary conditions are also required for
a smooth euclidean continuation  h (1)
continues to k which vanishes exponentially
at the horizon while the other solution diverges. this is tantamount to choosing hartle-
hawking boundary conditions for the black 3-brane. dierent choices of bulk-boundary
propagator for ads/cft would correspond in the ads bubble interpretation to dierent
boundary conditions for the 3-brane.



spacelike momenta: the propagator (2.14) is dened even for spacelike momenta with

q2 = 2 ~k2 < 0. in this case, setting q =p|q2|, and demanding regularity at the horizon

and at innity gives the near and far solutions:

near :   z2 kl+2(qz)

;

far :   r2 kl+2(qr) .

(3.6)

the solutions vanish exponentially both at the horizon (z = ) and at innity (r = ),
and so are not scattering states. the interpretation of (3.1) for spacelike momenta therefore
remains puzzling.

3.2. s-matrix: global coordinates

in order to interpret (3.1) in global coordinates we want to construct a cads bub-
ble inside a spacetime that admits propagating asymptotic states in a single asymptotic
region. a stable string solution of this kind is not known.9 nevertheless, for purposes of
illustration, consider a spacetime with the metric:10

r < rb :

ds2 = (1 + r2)d 2 +

r > rb :

ds2 = (1 + r2

b )d 2 +

dr2
1 + r2 + r2d2
dr2
+ r2d2 .

1 + r2
b

(3.7)

the interior metric is cads in coordinates sec2  = 1 + r2 and we have set the ads scale
r to 1. the induced metrics match on the surface r = rb. this metric is not expected
to be a solution to string theory, and initial data corresponding to such a geometry would
certainly evolve with time. nevertheless, any string solution containing a metastable ads
bubble will share certain features of scalar eld propagation that we now study.

9 of course the full analytic continuation of the 3-brane metric has a cads interior and an

innite number of asymptotic regions [24] whose interpretation can be problematic.

10 this simple metric is not asymptotically at, although it is possible to write more complicated

ones that are. nevertheless, it permits the denition of asymptotic particle states.

we want to compute the eective potential seen by a massless scalar of angular mo-
mentum l propagating in (3.7). it is useful to work in terms of the tortoise coordinate

r satisfying dr/dr = pgrr/g  . let us expand the scalar  in spherical harmonics as

 = yl ~m u/r3/2 where r2 is the coecient of d2 in (3.7). then radial motion is governed
by the action:

allowing a denition of asymptotic states.

consider an incident wave moving towards r = 0 from r  rb. within the ads region
we want a solution that is smooth at r = 0. this selects the mode (2.19). matching to
the exterior incident wave would give an absorption coecient. we are interested in a
somewhat dierent analysis where we construct a number of well separated wavepackets
in the asymptotic region and focus them to meet and interact within the ads bubble.
the actual interaction within ads is then completely described by the cft correlators
in (3.1). to compare to the full s-matrix computed in the asymptotic region we need
the probability of penetrating into ads, which will provide the correct normalization of
cft elds. the latter data depend on the precise patching of the ads bubble into the
asymptotic region. the cft correlators in (3.1) summarize the universal, and nontrivial,
part of the scattering amplitude which we can isolate by taking rb   in (3.7). in this
limit, we recover cads. so, although the modes (2.19) are not normalizable and uctuating
within the full cads, the expression (3.1) is a universal limiting s-matrix for scattering
from a large cads bubble.

this s-matrix interpretation also explains the origin of the singularities of the bulk-
boundary propagator at the magic frequencies (2.22). as discussed in sec. 2, there is a
spectrum of normalizable states in ads at the frequencies nl = 2h+ + l + n. while a
wave incident on a cads bubble at generic frequencies will mostly reect, near resonance
(  nl) the wavefunction for r < rb will scale as 1/(  nl  i). here  is a decay
width for states inside the bubble and   0 as rb  . the peak in the scattering
amplitude at resonance becomes a pole as the cads states become stable in the rb  
limit. this explains the origin of the otherwise disturbing singularity in the bulk-boundary
propagator at the magic frequencies.

13

3.3. interpretation

we should stress that the bubble construction used to interpret (3.1) is simply a useful

artice that can be removed. the non-trivial physics summarized in (3.1) is precisely that

of scattering inside ads. an alternate way to see this is to consider introducing sources for

particles at nite but large radius in ads. in the limit as the source goes to the boundary,

and at the same time has its amplitude scaled up to compensate for the vanishing tunneling

factors, we also recover (3.1).

furthermore, our discussion has used a diagrammatic expansion for the nearly free

limit which is suspect in the fully holographic theory. nonetheless, our interpretation of

(3.1) as a natural analogue of an s-matrix can be expected to hold in the full theory,

providing a path from boundary to bulk physics.

4. states and transition amplitudes

in the previous section, we have found an interpretation for truncated time-ordered

bulk green functions convolved against non-normalizable modes. we might expect that

green functions convolved against normalizable modes have a meaning as well. indeed,

the conventional lsz prescription in at space relates s-matrix elements, dened as the

overlap of in and out states with well-dened particle number, to truncated green

functions convolved against one-particle wavefunctions. therefore, in this section we return

to the issue of uctuating states in ads and transition amplitudes between them. we

will show in sec. 4.1 that this prescription fails in cads space because in and out

states, propagating as a collection of widely separated single non-interacting particles, do

not exist. roughly this is because lightlike geodesics hit the boundary in nite time, while

spacelike geodesics always reect back into the bulk after nite time. so particles (classical

or quantum) do not become innitely separated in the far past. to avoid this subtlety

we will partition ads into patches within which geodesics do not reconverge, and show

that the appropriate cft dual computes transition amplitudes between uctuating states

dened on the patch.

4.1. the failure of lsz in cads

to dene in and out states in the usual manner we follow sec. 3.1 of [25]. assume

we can split up the hamiltonian as:

h = h0 + hi ,

14

(4.1)

where h0 is a free hamiltonian, but contains the renormalized masses so that h0 and h
have the same one-particle spectrum. then in heisenberg picture, both free and interacting
one-particle states satisfy:

h00, = e0,

;

h = e .

(4.2)

here  denotes the full set of quantum numbers  momenta, spin, and so on. in states
+
 are dened by the requirement that wavepackets constructed from them approach free
wavepackets at early times:

eihtz d g() +



t eih0tz d g() 0,

(4.3)

here g() is a kernel used to dene wavepackets. out elds 
with the limit replaced by t  .

 are dened identically,

the lippmann-schwinger equation provides a recursive solution:



 = 0, +z d

h0,|hi |
 i
e  e  i

0,

(4.4)

now we multiply both sides by g()eiet and sum over . wave packets built from (4.4)
satisfy (4.3) if:

lim

tz z d d eiet g()

h0,|hi |
 i
e  e  i

0, = 0 .

(4.5)

we will check this condition in minkowski and cads spaces.

minkowski spacetime:
in minkowski space, the energy spectrum is continuous. ex-
tending the integral in (4.5) over positive and negative energies and integrating over ,
the contour is closed in the upper half-plane for in states. the pole in the denominator
is then avoided. there may be additional poles in g() controlling the energy width of
the state, and poles in the matrix element controlling the duration of collision. for large,
negative t, the integral will be a sum over these poles and exponentially damped. out
states may be treated similarly

cads spacetime: in cads the energies of particles are discrete and given by (2.22). this
spectrum is essentially dictated by the representation theory of the ads isometry group;
so we do not expect the integral spacing of levels to be aected by quantum corrections.
then k particles with masses mi have a total energy,11

e =

k

xi=1(cid:16)2h(k)

+ + lk + 2nk(cid:17) ,

(4.6)

11 generally, the multiparticle energy may not be a sum of single particle energies; this formula

is for illustrations sake.

15

and the left side of (4.5) is almost periodic in time with period 2, up to an overall phase

i=1

ei(cid:0)pk

2h(k)

+ (cid:1)t .

thus the last term in (4.4), summed against g() eiet, is nite and oscillatory in time,
and the conditions in (4.3) cannot be met. this almost-periodic behavior of wavefunctions
is the quantum reection of the classical statement that geodesics are periodic in global
time.

4.2. transitions between states

despite the subtlety described above we might expect to construct physically inter-
esting transition amplitudes between states within a patch of ads in which geodesics are
not periodic. a particularly convenient patch is provided by the poincare coordinates
discussed in sec. 2. the cads and pads metrics were presented in sec. 2 and, as shown
in fig. 3, the global spacetime can be constructed as a pads ladder. we will refer to the
nth patch as padsn. each patch has a timelike boundary bn and a past (h 
n )and future
(h +

n ) horizon.

cads from pads: to dene the theory on padsn we need boundary conditions at bn,
h +
n . boundary data on bn are specied by turning on frozen, non-normalizable
solutions of the form [17,8,7]:

n and h 

k(x) = a zd/2 h (1)

 (qz) eit+i~k~x .

(4.7)

for timelike frequenices(q2 = 2  ~k2 > 0), these modes are pure ingoing (outgoing) at
the horizon for  > 0 ( < 0),

k(x) z b z(d1)/2 ei(qzt)+i~k~x .

(4.8)

modes with spacelike frequencies (q2 = 2  ~k2 < 0) vanish exponentially at the horizon
and are not of interest to us here. the normalizable mode solutions of the wave equation
are [14,15,8]:

k(x) = a zd/2 j (qz) eit+ikx

and are a mixture of outgoing and ingoing modes at the horizon

(4.9)

1

k(x) z b z(d1)/2 hei(qzt 

2  

4 )+i~k~x + ei(qz+t 

2  

4 )+i~k~xi .

we can patch together these modes on a series of patches to obtain a solution to the cads
wave equation. for example, suppose that the mode k is present on padsn. to match the

16

ux at the horizon we could turn on k with positive frequency on padsn1 and k with
negative frequency on padsn+1. a general solution on cads which vanishes at very early
and very late times is constructed by turning on a collection of  with positive frequency on

some early patch, matching onto a sequence of normalizable and non-normalizable modes
in later patches, and then soaking up the ux by a collection of  with negative frequency

on a late patch. this process of splicing solutions is displayed schematically in fig. 5.

we have just described how to constructed classical solutions to the cads wave equa-
tions by sewing pads modes together.
in the classical limit, given dirichlet boundary
conditions for padsn, the normalizable modes (4.9) propagate undisturbed from the past
to the future horizon. in the interacting theory, these modes are the candidate early and
late time states between which we wish to compute transition amplitudes. in the following,

we will describe how to do this from the dual cft perspective.

fig. 5: cads solutions from pads

cft dual: the construction of cads as a tower of pads patches is dual to the denition

of lorentzian cfts on a stack of minkowski diamonds [18]. the classical limit in spacetime

is dual to the large n limit of the cft, and the splicing prescriptions for classical solutions
translate into relations between the cfts dened on the boundaries bn of the tower of
patches. let on be the cft operator on bn that is dual to a eld . deforming the

large n cft on bn1 by adding the term r 0(b) on1(b) to the lagrangian is dual in

spacetime to a classical non-normalizable mode that approaches 0(b) on the boundary
[2,3,8]. working in a fourier basis, a source for on1(k) in the cft is therefore dual to
turning on the bulk-boundary propagator (2.14) (or k) as a classical mode in the bulk.
the patching conditions for cads then induce a classical mode in padsn to soak up the
incoming ux at the past horizon. choosing the normalizable mode k is dual to placing
the cft on bn in the corresponding coherent state [7]. finally, we can match onto
a negative frequency k mode in padsn+1. this naturally provides a source term for a
negative frequency mode of on+1.

17

from this we learn that states in padsn can be created (annihilated) by positive
(negative) frequency operators o acting on past (future) patches. we are interested in
transitions between states of padsn. so it is sucient to consider operators acting on
bn1 and bn+1. writing the positive and negative frequency parts of o as o+ and o,
incoming states |sin at h 

n are dened as:

|sin  o+

n1(k1)    o+

n1(ks)|0in1 .

(4.11)

here the incoming state at the past horizon of the nth patch has been identied with the
action of positive frequency operators on the poincare vacuum state of bn1. likewise,
the outgoing state at the future horizon can be written as:

nhs|  n+1h0|o

n+1(ks)    o

n+1(k1) .

(4.12)

here the action of negative frequency operators on the vacuum of bn+1 has been identied
with the outgoing state on padsn. in the nearly free limit, this associates the normalizable
modes (4.9) with the in and out states of pads. but (4.11) and (4.12) have the added virtue
of being well-dened even when interactions are turned on at nite n . what is more, these
denitions accord well with our intuition that states in a cft are created and annihilated
by operators acting at early and late times. here, operators on bn1 and bn+1 are acting
before and after the beginning and end of time from the padsn perspective.

pads transition amplitudes: we nally have all the ingredients to assemble transition
amplitudes in padsn from the cft perspective. transition amplitudes in padsn are
dened as the overlaps hs|si. from the dention of the in and out states, the calculation
we must perform is:

hs|si = h0|yi

o

n+1(ki) yj

o+

n1(kj)|0i .

(4.13)

the correlation functions are computed on the cads cylinder where the cft is actually
dened using the master formula (2.11). the notation om(k) indicates the fourier mode
of an operator which has support only on the patch bm of the cads boundary cylinder.
so, following (3.1), after fourier transforming we compute:

hs|si =z

k

yi=1

l

yj=1(cid:16)dxi dyj 

ki

(xi) +
kj

(yj)(cid:17) ht (x1)    (xk)(y1)    (yl)it .

(4.14)

here x and y are cads coordinates while  are positive and negative frequency, non-
normalizable poincare modes of the form (4.7) written in global coordinates. we then

18

interpret (4.13) as a transition amplitude for states on padsn. diagramatically we obtain
figs. 6a and 6b where the truncation of cads diagrams by the pads patch leaves legs

intersecting the past and future horizons. these legs are wavefunctions representing the
in and out states and, in the nearly free limit, will be given in padsn by the normalizable
ads modes. the shaded circles on the propagators from the cads boundary to the pads

horizons indicate that the full interacting propagator should be used to dene the meaning
of in and out states of padsn. in general this means that these states do not have a clear
interpretation as single particle wavefunctions, but they nevertheless give a basis for the
initial and nal time boundary conditions for pads.

(a)

(b)

(c)

fig. 6: pads diagrams computing transition amplitudes

in addition to the transition amplitudes (4.13) we may compute amplitudes like

hs|o1(k1)    on(km)|si .

(4.15)

diagramatically these are represented in fig. 6c. following previous sections these ampli-

tudes may be interpreted as amplitudes for scattering from an excited ads bubble. the
local operator insertions on the padsn boundary appear in the bulk as non-normalizable
modes while the states are represented by normalizable modes in the nearly-free limit.

4.3. discussion

conclusion and subtleties: at rst glance (4.14) appears to describe pads transition

amplitudes as truncated bulk green functions convolved again normalizable wavefunctions.
this interpretation basically applies in the nearly free limit, leading to fig. 6a. in general,

however, the interactions in (4.14) may occur anywhere within cads, leading to fig. 7.

19

one way of dealing with this subtlety is to create states via well separated wavepackets in
padsn1 that do not interact until they have entered padsn. this is certainly possible
in the semiclassical limit, and in this way the in-states on the past horizon remain under
reasonable control. another approach is to simply dene the states on the past (future)
horizon to be the objects on those surfaces that result via propagation through the previous
(later) patches. in the latter approach, as illustrated in fig. 7, the particle number of the
in and out states may be indenite; but these states are nonetheless well dened via the
operator constructions (4.11) and (4.12).

fig. 7: contributions from the truncated green function outside padsn.

truncated ads: instead of building up cads as a sequence of pads patches we could
simply construct a sequence of cylinders of length t in global time. we will call the nth
cylinder tadsn. as we have discussed, the eect of acting on the boundary with a cft
operator is transported into spacetime by the bulk-boundary propagator. by denition,
this propagator in position space is a delta function on the boundary.
it follows from
this that a bulk-boundary propagator with support only on the tadsn1 boundary must
create a solution that is expandable in the normalizable mode solutions of the next patch
tadsn. we can therefore precisely mimic the pads construction above to construct tran-
sition amplitudes for tads states. again, in the nearly free limit, these are normalizable
modes convolved against truncated green functions, all in patch n, but a more complicated
interpretation applies in the fully interacting theory.

flat space s-matrix from ads: the methods of this section were designed to describe
the scattering of wavepackets created on the early and late boundaries of a patch.
in
the very large n limit, the spacetime is nearly at in the interior. our techniques can
readily be used to to construct wavepackets within the at region of the bulk spacetime.
then (4.13) gives a holographic computation of transition amplitudes between states in
at space. a very similar logic has been pursued recently in [11,12] where equations like
(3.1),(4.13) were also interpreted as transition amplitudes.

20

5. towards bulk correlators

it has been suggested that the on-shell transition amplitudes recovered in the pre-
ceding sections contain all the information we can extract from a holographic theory [26].
nonetheless, we know that approximate spacetime locality holds in nature and we would
like to see how it is encoded in the cft.

eqs. (2.15),(2.6) imply a relation between bulk and boundary correlators [6]:

ho1(b1)    on(bn)i =

n

yk=1

(k)
z
k

lim
zk0

h(z1, x1)    (zn, xn)i .

(5.1)

where (k)  2h+(k) is the conformal dimension of ok. this is true for general correlators,
suggesting the relation

o(b) = lim
z0

z(z, x) .

(5.2)

this is also implied in the n   limit by eq. (15) of [7]. if an inverse of the map (5.2)
exists, we could reconstruct o-shell bulk correlators from boundary data, and directly
investigate spacetime locality. this section will explore attempts to construct such an
inverse.

5.1. the free eld map

in the free limit we can invert (5.2) by comparing the bulk and boundary mode
expansions [6,7]. the bulk expansions for a scalar eld of mass m are xed by the equations
of motion and canonical commutation relations in spacetime.12 on the boundary we simply
expand in fourier modes and x the normalization via (5.2).

5.1.1. mode expansions

eq. (2.22) and the spherical harmonics y ~m satisfy the standard orthonormality conditions

z d y 

 ~m() y ~m () =   ~m ~m n .

(5.4)

the creation and annihilation operators (b, b) satisfy the commutation relations

[bq~k, bq ~k ] = (q  q)(d1)(~k  ~k) .

5.1.2. bulk operators from boundary operators?

the bulk and boundary mode expansions can be conveniently related via a transfer

matrix [6]:

(z, b) =z db m (z, b; b) o(b) .

(5.10)

the explicit transfer matrices are readily found by fourier transforming (5.6) and (5.9).
in cads this gives

13 the z  0 limit is formal and is taken term by term in the expansion in q; otherwise there
is an order-of-limits issue in using the small-argument asymptotics for j at the upper end of the

integral.

this gives a concrete proposal for the map from boundary to bulk elds, and, as in
[6], we might now attempt to promote it to the interacting theory and infer local bulk
correlators via

h(z1, b1)(z2, b2)    (zn, bn)i ?=z

(5.13)
however, as the authors of [6] noted, this cannot be correct because the result satises
the free wave equation rather than the interacting dyson-schwinger equations. the next
subsection explains this using the lehmann representation for bulk elds.

in fact, from (3.1) we know that the right hand side of (5.13) can be expressed as:

z

(5.14)

where 
 denotes a normalizable wavefunction and the integrals over k are shorthand for
the full sum/integral over fourier conjugate variables appropriate to either the global or
poincare case. prior to integrating over k, the right side of (5.14) is a truncated bulk
green function projected onto non-normalizable, on-shell wavefunctions. this is further
convolved against normalizable modes in (5.14). so it is manifest that the right side of
(5.13) satises a free wave equation.

5.2. a lehmann representation for cads

dusedau and freedman [13] constructed a lehmann representation for ads using the
decomposition of the eld theory hilbert space on adsd+1 into representations of so(d, 2).
the starting point is the identity written as a sum over conformal representations. labeling
the conformal weight by  and the elements of the representation by (n, l), we have:

i =z d xn,,m

|; n, , mih; n, , m|

(5.15)

23

where the energy of |; n, , mi with respect to global time is 
n =  +  + 2n. in a
lehmann representation, the two point function of the full (interacting) scalar elds  can
be written in terms of the two-point function of free scalar elds  in representation ,
integrated over  with a spectral weight ():

ht ((x)(y))i =z d () gf (; x  y) .

(5.16)

here gf is the feynman propagator for a free scalar eld with mass m2

 = (  d).

determination of  proceeds as in at space. consider a a canonically normalized free

eld of conformal weight . it follows trivially that

h0|(x)|; n, , mi = +

nm(x)

(5.17)

where + is the normalizable wavefunction multiplying anm in the expansion for . a
general interacting scalar eld  must have the same matrix element up to a normalization
factor:

h0|(x)|; , ni = n ()+

n(x) ,

(5.18)

for any . eq. (5.16), with () = |n ()|2, then follows from inserting (5.15) into the
right hand side of the two-point function.

a similar decomposition holds on the boundary, since its hilbert space and symmetries

are the same. the coordinate dependence in

h0|o(b)|; , ni = n ()ei

,nty()

(5.19)

is again determined by symmetries. for a conformal primary operator o with dimension
(o), n will have support only at  = (o). this is compatible with the more compli-
cated spectral decomposition of the dual operator , so long as the minimal value of 
for which n () has support is (o). eq. (5.1) implies that

h0|o(, t)|; , ni = lim

/2

(cos )(o)h0|(, , t)|; , ni .

(5.20)

the interacting eld  may contain components of many dierent conformal weights, but
the matrix element h0|(, , t)|; , ni is a normalizable mode with xed conformal weight
. so it falls o at the boundary as cos , and the right side of (5.20) vanishes for any
 > (o).

eq. (5.20) shows that restricting  to the boundary isolates the representation of
so(2, d) with the lowest mass/conformal dimension in the interacting eld. this should be
thought of as a single-particle state corresponding to , following the at space analogy.

24

the cft primary o carries precisely this conformal dimension. the cft operators

function similarly to the in and out states:

h0||, n, i

/2
 (cos )(o)h0|o|, n, i

is the analog of the weak asymptotic condition

h0||, n, it z 1

2 h0|in|, n, i

in at-space eld theory (c.f. for example [27].)

(5.21)

(5.22)

moral of the story: the fact that restricting the bulk interacting elds to the boundary

isolates the single particle states teaches us two very important things. first we understand

why (5.13) fails as an attempt to reconstruct local bulk correlators; the formula does not

contain the multi-particle part of the bulk elds. secondly, we understand why the s-

matrix prescriptions of sec. 3 and sec. 4 work even in the interacting theory; boundary

operators really do create acceptable single-particle asymptotic states. this feature of the

map (5.2) gives us one way to think about the general problem of reconstructing interacting

bulk elds from the boundary. presumably, in order to create the multi-particle pieces

of a bulk eld we will have to write a cft operator containing a sum of various products

of cft primaries and descendants.

5.3. towards interacting elds

in this section we will try to construct the interacting eld  from the cft. we will

operationally reproduce a spacetime perturbation expansion via calculations in the large

n cft, where there is a free-eld representation.

5.3.1. spectral decomposition and propagators

our starting points are the decompositions (5.6) and (5.9):

and

(5.23)

(5.24)

which write the cft operators as sums of appropriate fourier modes. o(n, ) and o(q)

may be extracted from o via a (nonlocal) transform following from (5.6) and (5.9). in

25

the poincare case, (5.24) is an eective decomposition of o onto mass-shells of xed
q2 = 2  k2. indeed, we can use (5.9) to suggestively write the two-point function as:

ht (o(t, ~x) o(t, ~x))i =z dq ht (o(q; t, ~x) o(q; t, ~x))i

=

1

22+1((1 + ))2 z dq q2+1 (q2; t  t, ~x  ~x)

(5.25)

where (q2) is the feynman propagator for a free particle with mass q2 on r1,d1. this
is the spectral representation for the two-point function of a conformal primary with di-
mension 2h+ = (d/2 + ) (c.f. ref. [28]). a similar representation should exist for global
coordinates.

the transfer matrix relation in sec. 5.1.2 between bulk and boundary elds was
nonlocal in the boundary coordinates. in contrast, the large n spectral elds o(n, )
and o(q) are related to bulk free elds by local transformations:

(t, , ) = (1 + ) xn,,m(cid:18) (1 + n)

(1 + n + )(cid:19)

(cos 2) o(n, ; t, )

(5.26)

(n, ; ) o(n, ; t, )

and

the latter formula implies that free bulk operators arise from a bessel transformation of
large n spectral elds on the boundary.

the simplicity of these relations extends to bulk two-point functions. if we attempt to
write these using (5.10), the time-ordering operator fails to push through to the boundary
elds and a cumbersome expression results. the spectral elds yield a simpler result:14

ht ((z1, b1)(z2, b2))i =z dq1 dq2 (q1; z1) (q2; z2) ht (o(q1; b1) o(q2; b2))i

=

1

22+1((1 + ))2 z dq q2+1 (q; z1) (q; z2) (q2; b1  b2) .

(5.28)
here the only transformation we have done is between bulk radial coordinate and cft
mass-shell, and the time-ordering remains untouched.

14 for simplicity we focus on the poincare case.

5.3.2. interactions

eq. (5.2) appears to relate the bulk interacting elds to the boundary operators.
however, we showed that it does so in a way that projects onto the non-interacting part
of the eld.
is there a prescription to recover the full bulk elds, or equivalently their
correlators?

there is no reason to expect that the interacting elds can be linearly expanded in
terms of creation and annihilation operators obeying (5.5) or (5.8). instead, they should
contain products of the free eld creation and annihilation operators, corresponding to
multi-particle interacting states. at least in the semiclassical (large n ) limit, this dis-
tinction is captured in the relation between heisenberg and interaction picture operators:

h(x, t) = eihteih0ti (x, t)eih0teiht .

(5.29)

their correlators are related by

ht (1,h(z1, b1) . . . n,h (zn, bn))i = ht(cid:16)1,i(z1, b1) . . . n,i (zn, bn)eir dthint(b,z,t)(cid:17)i

(5.30)
where hint is the interaction hamiltonian. within perturbative supergravity, hint is well-
dened and the interaction terms are suppressed by powers of 1/n [1].

we would like to reproduce this perturbative picture from the boundary perspective.
in the nite n cft it is far from clear that there is a corresponding denition of the
interaction representation. however, just as (5.30) is an expansion around the free limit,
we can attempt a construction about the innite n cft. the idea is to begin with the
free-eld operators, construct the bulk interaction picture elds via eqs. (5.10), (5.26), or
(5.27), and then infer from the bulk lagrangian the corresponding perturbation expansion
in the cft.

this procedure is most transparent in the language of the spectral elds. suppose

that the interaction hamiltonian is a simple coupling of three scalars i,15

hint =



n z dz dd1~x i(z, b) j(z, b) k(z, b) .

(5.31)

we transfer this to the boundary using the bessel transformation in (5.27), and integrate
over z. this gives:

hint(t)({o(q)}) =z dqi dqj dqk dd1~x v (qi, qj, qk) oi(qi; t, ~x) oj(qj; t, ~x) ok(qk; t, ~x)

(5.32)

15 again, we focus on the poincare case.

27

where

v (qi, qj, qk) =



n z dz (qi; z) (qj; z) (qk; z)

(5.33)

and oi(b) are the boundary operators dual to the scalars. other terms in the bulk inter-

action hamiltonian can also be converted into functionals of o(q) in the obvious way. the

bulk correlator (5.30) is then:

ht (1,h(z1, b1) . . . n,h (zn, bn))i =

z

n

yi=1

dqi (qi; zi) ht(cid:16)o(q1; b1) . . . o(qn; bn)eir dthint ({o(q)})(cid:17)i .

(5.34)

the expectation value in the second line can be computed perturbatively in hint using

wicks theorem and the propagator in eq. (5.25). this propagator can in turn be derived

by treating o(q) as a eld with an appropriate lagrangian. including interaction terms,

we can therefore imagine deriving the amplitudes perturbatively from

l =xk z dqk db

22k+1(1 + k)2

q2k+1
k

(cid:2)(ok(qk; b))2 + q2

kok(qk; b)2(cid:3)

+

1

n xijk z db dqi dqj dqk v (qi, qj, qk) oi(qi; b) oj(qj; b) ok(qk; b) + . . . .

(5.35)

this should be interpreted as a lagrangian for the collective elds o(q), and allows us
to compute cft correlators in a power series in 1/n .16

the dimension of o is encoded in the normalization factor

a(q, ) =

22+1(1 + )2

q2+1

,

(5.36)

and the operator product coecients for the primary operators are encoded in the three-

point couplings v (q1, q2, q3).

16 we are using the term collective eld theory somewhat loosely. the feature our theory

shares with collective eld theory in the usual sense [29] is that we take an overcomplete basis

of operators and promote them to independent lagrangian elds. and, as in [29], this lagrangian

gives a 1/n expansion for exact correlators of the theory. it is clearly desirable to relate these

two theories.

28

5.4. interpretation

our collective eld lagrangian (5.35) is local in spacetime after transforming q to z

via the kernel , and completely captures the leading perturbative supergravity. it is true

that we have constructed this theory from supergravity by at, but we have thus found

a fairly simple but not a priori obvious integral transformation between the resulting

collective elds and the n =  cft variables. we can now pose sharp questions directly

within the cft about the reconstruction of local spacetime physics. can we reproduce

a collective eld lagrangian like (5.35) (and therefore bulk supergravity) directly from the

gauge theory via standard large n techniques? can such a representation of the theory be

found at nite n ? in particular, the loop equations for 4d n = 4 yang-mills theory, which
we might hope reproduces string dynamics on ads5 s5, should contain our collective eld
theory in some   0 approximation. furthermore, the integral transformation between
bulk and boundary elds (5.27) is strongly reminiscent of the relation between correlators

of collective elds and tachyon elds in the c = 1 matrix model of 2d string theory [30].
we suspect that this similarity is not accidental.17

it would be interesting to see how the discussions in [6,7] relate to this manifestly

local description. in those papers, it was found that for classical probes, bulk locality in z

translated to a sort of scale-size locality in the large-n boundary theory. in eq. (5.27), q

functions as a scale, selecting a mass shell in the fourier expansion of the primary operator

o. this is suggestive, but does not give a precise translation of bulk radial locality into

cft scales because because q is related to z by an integral transform.

it is also amusing to note that the steps in section 5.3 can be reproduced in other

spaces besides ads, and used to dene a boundary theory from a given bulk theory.
one simple example denes a boundary lagrangian on the rd1 boundary of the upper
half space of rd. this observation may be relevant to exploration of holography in more
general contexts.

of course (5.35) cannot be the whole story. the expansion it provides in 1/n and
g2
ym will undoubtedly be asymptotic at best, and the hilbert space of this collective eld
theory is not the same as the hilbert space of the nite-n cft.18 however, this statement
is precisely what makes the collective eld theory (5.35) an interesting starting point for

studying bulk dynamics. classical gravity and its nave semiclassical extension are aicted

17 in fact the authors of [31] have suggested that the c = 1 matrix model is a holographic descrip-
tion of 1+1-dimensional string theory, precisely in the fashion of the ads/cft correspondence.
18 as an example, in ads3, n is related to the central charge of the theory. we are then trying

to capture the dynamics of a theory with nite c via an innite-c free eld description.

29

with well-known pathologies. the degree to which our collective eld theory is a poor
approximation to the exact cft should be precisely the degree to which our assumptions

about classical and semiclassical gravity are invalid; the full cft, which is manifestly

well-dened, will remove the pathologies. how it does so can in principle be learned by
understanding the dierence between our collective eld description and the full conformal

eld theory. this dierence will contain the non-locality resulting from the holographic

description.

6. conclusion

in this article we have interpreted the correlation functions of the cft duals of ads
spaces in terms of bulk s-matrices and transition amplitudes. first, vacuum correlators

of the cft were expressed in the bulk as truncated n-point functions convolved against

non-normalizable on-shell modes. we interpreted these expressions as an s-matrix for ads
arising from a limit of scattering in asymptotically at space from an ads bubble. in the

free limit, elds in ads spacetime possess a class of normalizable, uctuating solutions.

a traditional lsz prescription would compute transition amplitudes between these states.
we showed that the usual lsz framework fails in global ads spacetime, essentially because

the periodicity of geodesics obscures the denition of asymptotic states. we then avoided

this subtlety by partitioning ads into patches and showed that cft correlation functions
compute transition amplitudes between suitable states dened on these patches. these

states correspond to boundary conditions on the early and late time surfaces of a patch

and, unusually, were created and annihilated by the action of operators on the vacua of
earlier and later patches.

finally, we have tried to directly reconstruct local bulk operators from the boundary

cft. in the n   limit, this reconstruction is straightforward. but at nite n , single

cft primaries capture only the one-particle parts of the dual bulk operators, making re-
construction a nontrivial, nonlinear process. we proposed a collective eld theory which
reproduces cft correlators order by order in gym and 1/n , and manifestly reproduces
local, perturbative supergravity after a straightforward integral transformation. however,
this theory is not the full cft and we expect that the perturbation series is asymptotic

at best.

it is worth noting that many features of the collective eld description espoused in

sec. 5 break a striking resemblance to the matrix models of 2d string theory. this sim-
ilarity has been an important source of inspiration in the development of the ads/cft

correspondence [2,32,8] and we see it as an interesting guide for future work.

30

we have argued that it is possible to construct s-matrices and transition amplitudes
for spacetime states from the conformal eld theory dual. we expect that these amplitudes

cannot at the fundamental level be obtained from a local bulk quantum gravity theory, and
it would be interesting to learn how the violation of locality is manifested. one approach
is to look for breakdown of spacetime locality in deviations of the nite n dynamics from

the local-by-construction collective eld description proposed in this article. this eld
theory constructs cft correlators in a power-series expansion in 1/n and g2
ym. perhaps
analyticity of this power series is in itself related to locality. it is worth recalling the usual
story where mean eld assumptions can be destroyed by uctuations. perhaps locality

and causality are mean-eld properties. this idea is in line with the suggestions in
refs. [33,6,7,34] that local spacetime and causal properties are somehow thermodynamic
in character.
