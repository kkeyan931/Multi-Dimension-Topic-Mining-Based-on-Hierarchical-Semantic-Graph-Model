abstract

in a recent paper (hep-th/9811108), saveliev and the author showed that
there exits an on-shell light cone gauge where the non-linear part of the eld
equations reduces to a (super) version of yangs equations which may be solved
by methods inspired by the ones previously developed for self-dual yang-mills
equations in four dimensions. later on (hep-th/9903218), the analogy between
these latter theories and the present ones was pushed further by writing down
a set of super partial linear dierential equations which are the analogues of
the lax pair of belavin and zakharov. using this lax representation, it is
shown in the present article that solution-generating techniques are at work,
which are similar to the ones developed for four dimensional self-dual yang-
mills theories in the late seventies.

in memoriam mikhail v. saveliev

on the morning of september 21st 1998, i arrive in durham uk to participate in
the 2nd annual tmr conference. i have left paris rather early in order to deliver
my talk at 3 oclock concerning the recent progress with misha. i know that he has
not been well and i am much worried about him; but when ed. corrigan greets me
and says do you know that misha died yesterday?, i am thunderstruck. i suddenly
realise that we will never meet again. how terribly sad! our last encounter in
person was in cambridge uk at the beginning of march 1997. he had accompanied
me to the bus station in his usual attentionate and friendly manner, and we were
enthousiastically discussing about future research developments. the evening before
he had treated me to a hearty dinner cooked by him-self, which was the occasion of
a very friendly evening as he enjoyed so much. at that time, i felt so sure we would
soon meet again! we made plans to do that, in brazil in paris, or in tbilissi, but
time was always ying too fast. one always assume, wrongly that the good things
will remain for ever for us to reach! life is unfortunately too short.

how i miss his frequent email messages! they were so nice and stimulating.
in looking back at them i am impressed by what they brought me day after day:
new ideas, important remarks, key references to the scientic literature, results of
painstaking calculations, some personal news (too rarely) which gave me a glimpse
at the diculties of his every day life. in return, and when it came to it, i tried
as much as possible to express my sympathy and support but of course, concerning
every day life, russia is so dierent from what i know personally! on top of that, we
were ghting to make progress in our ambitious program solely by exchanging ideas
over the net, a notoriously dicult task. i am afraid that he was under too much
pressure, and that this was an important factor in the deterioration of his health.

some parts of his emails bring back so vividely the memory of the time already

past: on february 1998, misha wrote from moscow

dear jeanloup,
let me answer on yr section more diculties (unfortunately). denitely you
are right, ... now i understand that you was pretty right when said that we should
meet personally to put all the things in order; unfortunately now it is too late,
because i should leave for brazil already on 25.03.98, luiz already sent me tickets
and my grant opens just that time. nethertheless i am quite optimistic that we are
on the right track and will succeeded in solving the problem in the nearest future....

he wrote the following from brazil during spring 1998:
dear jean-loup,
thanks for yr 3 messages (mail, debut and a latex-le). ..... ill study yr le in
detail and then be back to you. i am alone here, mainly because svetlana jr has

2

her lessons at the university until june, then has exams, and since she is, let say a
home child, we would prefer not to leave her alone, especially since moscow is not
a quiet small place like protvino. so it would be lone for me these three months,
but better time for work. i would say that here it is very nice, luiz and other people
here, at ift, are very kind and careful to me; meals in the town are nicely in test;
i am sure you would like brazilian food. what do you think about tbilisi, will you
be able to come? in any case i am writing to my colleagues in tbilisi to send you
an invitation letter.

with best regards, misha
when my trip to brazil was cancelled, he wrote
dear jeanloup,
thank your for your today message. thats pity that you are not able to come
in sao paulo; hope that youll manage to arrange yr plans to visit tbilisi, otherwise
ill try to come in paris in the fall at least for a short while since we have a lot
of things to discuss in person, i believe that see now some remarkable directions
in geometry of supermanifolds, relevant pluckers, etc. and, as a joke, looking at
my directory gs (gervais-saveliev) containing a lot of messages we have exchanged
during this project, i think that we can publish a book of letters with a title how
many wrong & right ways might be in science...

in retrospect, i am rather struck by the following premonatory part of a message

he sent me during may 1998:

p.s. last evening i was very busy writing condolences to russia concerning our
very eminent physicists david kirzhnitz from theory div. of the lebedev inst.,
polubarinov from dubna (he was a coauthor of victor ogievetsky), whom both i
knew very good for some 30 years, and boris dzelepov, who have passed away two
days ago. thats a great pity to loose so many colleagues & friends this year!

on the other hand, i was far from realising that his health had so much deterio-
rated. he was always blaming his old car accident. for instance, he wrote en august
28th:

dear jean-loup,
sorry for a long silence. i was in a rather bad shape; just after my last message
to you i had several vascular spasms and swoons, once even with a loss of memory,
true for a short time. presumably, it is caused by my neck small bell problem after
the car crash in 1988. now i am slightly better, and am beginning to work, but feel
necessity to make some medical treatments in moscow. .... 

going further back in time, it is a pleasure to remember that i met misha for
the rst time in 1992 when his famous work with lesnov had already proven to be
so important for two dimensional conformal/integrable systems. we immediately
started to collaborate and have done so, at least on a part time basis, ever since.
his contribution to our research program has been invaluable. after a series of pa-
pers concerned with two dimensional toda theories where we successively discussed
black hole solutions, w geometries, and higher grading generalisations we more
recently turned to the explicit classical integration of supersymmetric theories with
local symmetries in more than two dimensions, a very ambitious program which is
still far from completion at the present time. working with misha has been a won-
derful experience which terminated so abruptly! i will always remember our excited
and friendly discussions, his kindness and enthousiam, his fantastic knowledge of
the scientic literature! we, at ecole normale, were lucky enough to invite him

3

for several extended visits which were extremely fruitful. misha and i met in other
places, but altogether much too rarely.

i will always remember the fun we had in discussing physics; but i now regret
that, although we were very good friends, we seldom took time to socialise outside
research. these few very warm and friendly encounters are dear to my memory,
especially when his svetlanas (as he used to say) were present. this happened in
particular for a day in my country house during one of his stay in paris and on one
evening in his apartment when he was visiting cambridge uk. it is good to remember
how happy he was on these occasions, how aectionate and (rightly) proud he was
with his wife and daughter, how friendly and warmly he behaved!

m. saveliev was great both as a scientist and as a human being. he was obviously

such a good father, husband, friend!

1 introduction

in recent times we turned[1] to the classical integration of theories in more than two
dimensions with local extended supersymmetries. our motivation was twofold. on
the one hand this problem is very important for the recent developments in duality
and m theory. on the other hand, the recent advances initiated by seiberg and
witten indicate that these theories are in many ways higher dimensional analogues
of two dimensional conformal/integrable systems, so that progress may be expected.
since fall 1997, we have studied super yang-mills theories in ten dimensions. there,
it was shown by witten[3] that the eld equations are equivalent to atness condi-
tions. this is a priori similar to well known basic ones of toda theories, albeit no real
progress could be made at that time, since the corresponding lax type equations
involve an arbitrary light like vector which plays the role of a spectral parameter. at
rst, we reformulated the eld equations in a way which is similar to a super version
of the higher dimensional generalisations of toda theories developed by razumov
and saveliev[2], where the yang-mills gauge algebra is extended to a super one. this
has not yet been published since, contrary to our initial hope, the two types of theo-
ries do not seem to be equivalent. i hope to return to this problem in a near future.
in the mean time, we found the existence of an on-shell gauge, in super yang-mills
where the eld equations simplify tremendously and where the rst similarity with
self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions came out[1]. more recently[4], i was able
to write down a set of super partial linear dierential equations whose consistency
conditions may be derived from the susy y-m equations in ten dimensions, and
which are the analogues of the lax pair of belavin and zakharov[6].

4

as is well known, super yang-mills theories in ten dimensions just describes a
standard non abelian gauge eld coupled with a charged majorana-weyl spinor eld
in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. the dynamics is thus specied by
the standard action

s =z d10x tr(cid:26)

4

ymny mn +

1
2

(cid:16)mm + [xm, ](cid:17)(cid:27) ,

ymn = mxn  nxm + [xm, xn] .

(1.1)

(1.2)

the notations are as follows2: xm(x) is the vector potential, (x) is the majorana-
weyl spinor. both are matrices in the adjoint representation of the gauge group
g. latin indices m = 0, . . . 9 describe minkowski components. greek indices  =
1, . . . 16 denote chiral spinor components. we will use the superspace formulation
with odd coordinates . the super vector potentials, which are valued in the gauge
group, are noted am (x, ), a (x, ). as shown in refs. [3], [5], we may remove all
the additional elds and uniquely reconstruct the physical elds xm,  from am
and a if we impose the condition a = 0 on the latter.

with this condition, it was shown in refs. [3], [5], that the eld equations derived

from the lagrangian 1.1 are equivalent to the atness conditions

where f is the supercovariant curvature

f=0,

f = da + da + [a, a] + 2 (m) am.

d denote the superderivatives

d =   (m) m,

and we use the dirac matrices

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

(1.8)

(1.9)

throughout the paper, it will be convenient to use the following particular realisa-
tion:

m =

01616

01616  , 11 =  11616
(cid:16)(m)(cid:17)
(cid:16)(m)(cid:17)
(cid:18)(cid:16)9(cid:17)(cid:19) =(cid:18)(cid:16)9(cid:17)(cid:19) =  188 088
188 !
(cid:18)(cid:16)0(cid:17)(cid:19) = (cid:18)(cid:16)0(cid:17)(cid:19) =  188 088
088 188 !
0  ,

(cid:16)i t(cid:17),

(cid:18)(cid:16)i(cid:17)(cid:19) =(cid:18)(cid:16)i(cid:17)(cid:19) =

0

i
,

088

0

11616 ! .

0

i = 1, . . . 8.

the convention for greek letters is as follows: letters from the beginning of the
alphabet run from 1 to 16. letters from the middle of alphabet run from 1 to 8.
in this way, we shall separate the two spinor representations of o(8) by rewriting
1, . . . , 16 as 1, . . . , 8, 1, . . . , 8

2they are essentially the same as in ref.[1].

5

using the above explicit realisations on sees that the equations to solve take the

form

f  da + da + [a, a]+ = 2 (a0 + a9)
f  da + da + [a, a]+ = 2 (a0  a9)

f  da + da + [a, a]+ = 2

(1.10)
(1.11)

(1.12)

in my last paper with m. saveliev [1], these atness conditions in superspace were
used to go to an on-shell light-cone gauge where half of the superelds vanish.
after reduction to (1 + 1) dimensions, the non-linear part of the equations was
transformed into equations for a scalar supereld which are (super) analogues of
the so called yang equations which were much studied in connection with solutions
of self-dual yang-mills equations in four dimensions. the main dierences between
the two type of relations is that derivatives are now replaced by superderivatives,
that there are sixteen equations instead of four, and that the indices are paired
dierently. nevertheless, it was found that these novel features are precisely such
that the equations may be solved by methods very similar to the ones developed
in connection with self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions. the aim of the present
paper is to push this analogy much further, by deriving the analogues of the lax
pair of belavin zakharov[6] which was instrumental for deriving multi-instanton
solutions at the end of the seventies.

2 the lax representation

for completeness, let us repeat the essential points of ref.[4]. the original theory is
o(9, 1) invariant, but the choice of dirac matrices just summarized is covariant only
under a particular o(8) subgroup. the lax representation comes out after picking
up a particular o(7) subgroup of the latter. this done simply by remarking that we
may choose one i to be the unit matrix, in which case the others are antisymmetric
and obey the o(7) dirac algebra. this is so, for instance in the following explicit
representation of the o(8) gamma matrices, where 8 is equal to one, which we will
use throughout:

1 = 1  31  1
2 = 1  1  31
3 = 31  1  1
4 = 31  31  31

5 = 3  31  1
6 = 1  3  31
7 = 31  1  3
8 = 1  1  1.

(2.1)

with this choice, it follows from equations 1.101.12 that

f = 2 (a0 + ag) , f = 2 (a0  ag) , f + f = 4a8.

(2.2)

we have symmetrized the mixed (last) equations so that the right-hand sides only
involve kronecker deltas in the spinor indices. by taking 8 to be the unit matrix,
we have introduced a mapping between overlined and non overlined indices. ac-
cordingly, in the previous equation and hereafter, whenever we write an overlined
index and non overlined one with the same letter (such as  and ) we mean that

6

they are numerically equal, so that 8
 = 1. next, in parallel with what was done
for self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions, it is convenient to go to complex (super)
coordinates. thus we introduce, with i the square root of minus one3,

g = f  f + if + if

g = f  f  if  if,

g = f + f + if  if,

 = d + id,  = d  id,

b = a + ia, b = a  ia.

a straightforward computation shows that

[, ]+ = 4 (9  i8) ,

[, ]+ = 4 (9 + i8) ,

[, ]+ + [, ]+ = 80

consider, now the system of dierential equations

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

d ()  ( +  + b + b) () = 0,  = 1, . . . , 8.

(2.7)

of course, although we do not write it for simplicity of notations, () is a super-
eld function of x and . the parameter  is an arbitrary complex number. the
consistency condition of these equations is

[d, d]+ () = 0.

(2.8)

this gives

{4 (9  i8) + g}  +  {80 + g + g} 

+2 {4 (9 + i8) + g}  = 0.

thus we correctly get that, for  6= 

g = g = g + g = 0,

and that g g, g do not depend upon . thus these consistency conditions
are equivalent to the symmetrized dynamical equations 2.2.

3 solution generating mechanism

in this section we discuss a solution generating mechanism analogous to the one
developed for self-dual yang-mills in four dimensions in ref[7]. although this is
not absolutly necessary, we will assume in order to simplify the discussion that
there is no dependence upon xi, for i = 1, . . . , 8. thus, besides the odd fermionic
variables, the superelds only depends upon x = x0  x9. in ref.[4], the hermiticity
conditions for superelds were established with su(n) as the gauge group, assuming

3for the new symbols, the group theoretical meaning of the fermionic indices   is lost. we

adopt this convention to avoid clusy notations.

7

to avoid complications that only look at solutions such that  = 0. for these purely
bosonic solutions a and am only involve odd and even powers of  respectively.
the hermiticity condition on superelds is that

a

 = kak, a

m = kamk,

(3.1)

with

k = (1)r(r1)/2 .

we will write in general the above hermiticity conditions under the form a
a

m =  am and so on. thus

b = b.

(3.2)
 =  a,

assume that we only consider solutions of equation 2.7 which are regular at  = 0.
then it follows that we may write

b =  () 1,  = (0).

(3.3)

then

b = k 1(cid:16)(cid:17) k =(cid:16) 1(cid:17) .

an easy computation then shows that we may change gauge by replacing   ,
in such a way that the lax equtions become

( +   a) () = 0

where a = (g) g1, and

in this gauge, at  = 0, we get

g = .

so that

(0) = (g) g10,

(0) = g.

(3.4)

(3.5)

following the discussion of ref.[7] closely, the input is a solution 0 of equations 3.4,
such that a0
 = (0(0)) (0)1. we look for a solution of equations 3.4 in the
following form

where

() = ()0(),

() = 1 +

nxk=1

rk

  k

.

(3.6)

(3.7)

the quantities rk are superelds which are n  n matrices, and k are superelds
independent from . hence  is meromorphic in the  plane. substitute the ansatz
3.6 into equations 3.4. one gets

( + ) .1 + a0

1. = a

since ()1() = 1, the ansatz 3.7 immediately implies that

rk1(k) = 0.

8

(3.8)

(3.9)

thus we may write

(rk)ab =

skxj=1

a m(k,j)
n(k,j)

b

,

m(k,j).q(k,) 

(cid:16)1(k)(cid:17)ab
nxa=1

m(k,j)

a

=

nx=sk+1

q(k,)
a

p(k,)
b

,

(3.10)

q(k,)
a = 0,

(3.11)

where sk are the dimensions of the subspaces upon which rk projects. we write the
above as

rk =

n(k,j)  m(k,j), 1(k) =

skxj=1

nx=sk+1

q(k,)  p(k,).

the left hand side of equation 3.8 would contain second and rst order poles at
 = k, whereas the right-hand side is analytic.

absence of double pole this leads to the conditions

k + kk = 0.

(3.12)

let us preceed by analogy with the bosonic case. consider an arbitrary supereld
h(, x+, x, 1, . . . 8, 1, . . . 8), noted h() for brevity satisfying

( + ) h() = 0.

(3.13)

note that, in terms of d and d this means that

so that

(d + id) h +  (d  id) h,

(1 + ) dh + i (1  ) dh = 0,

dh + i

1  
1 + 

dh = 0.

therefore, the solution of this equation was already derived in ref.[1]. equation 3.12
is satised if k are superelds, that is,

k(cid:16)x+, x, 1, . . . 8, 1, . . . 8(cid:17) ,

which are such that

h(cid:16)x+, x, 1, . . . 8, 1, . . . 8, k(x+, x, 1, . . . 8, 1, . . . 8)(cid:17)  0.

(3.14)

proof

indeed, since we get identically zero, we have

h(k) = 0 = h| xed =k

+

h


(k)k,

h

the result follows from the equation h + h = 0.

h(k) = 0 = h| xed =k

+

(k)k.

9

absence of rst order poles this leads to the condition

(rk + rk) .1(k) + rka0

1(k) = 0.

(3.15)

substitute equation 3.10. one has

(rk) 1(k) = 

skxj=1

n(k,j)  m(k,j)
n(k,j) (cid:16)m(k,j)(cid:17) nx=sk+1

=

skxj=1

nx=sk+1

q(k,j)  p(k,j)

q(k,j)  p(k,j)

(rk) 1(k) =

skxj=1

n(k,j) (cid:16)m(k,j)(cid:17) nx=sk+1

q(k,j)  p(k,j).

thus we get

skxj=1
n(k,j) n( + k) m(k,j)o nx=sk+1
n(k,j)  m(k,j) a0

+
skxj=1
n( + k) m(k,j)o q(k,) + m(k,j)a0

nx=sk+1

q(k,)  p(k,)

q(k,)  p(k,) = 0

q(k,) = 0.

thus we conclude that we have to solve the equations

solution of these equations we observe that 0(k) satises

(cid:16) +   a0

(cid:17) 0() = 0.

 ( + ) 1

0 ()  1

0 ()a0

 = 0,

thus we get

and, setting  = k,

 ( + k) 1

0 (k)  1

0 (k)a0

 = 0.

thus equations 3.16 are solved by

m(k,j)

a = m (k,j)

b

0 (cid:17)ba
(cid:16)1

(k),

where m (k,j)

b

is a solution of the equation

( + k) m (k,j)

b

= 0.

hermiticity according to equation 3.5

g = g.

(3.19)

a straightforward computation gives

(cid:16) +   g.g1(cid:17) g 1(1/) = 0.

we see that g 1(1/) and () satisfy the same equation. thus we may assume
that g 1(1/) = (). let us assume that the simple solution satises the same
condition: g0 1

0 (1/) = 0(). using the ansatz 3.7, we see that

thus we get

g 1(1/) 1

0 (1/) = ()0().

g 1(1/) g1

0 0() = ()0().

therefore, we arrive at the condition

we see that, at the poles (1/

question of determinent since the gauge group is taken to be su(n) we have to
impose that det g = 1. let us try to impose this condition, since is not satised yet.
for this purpose we want to compute the determinent of equation 3.25. consider
the case of only one pole rst. one has, in that case,

ab() =ac

it is easily veried that it is a projector such that

we may write

tr p xa
() = 1 

paa = tr (cid:16)1(cid:17) = s1.
p! 0().

after diagonalising, it is trivial that, if there is only one pole,

det  () =   1
  1 !s1

det 0.

if there are several poles, we may include them in succession by writing

then we get

rk

thus the determinent is not one. fortunately, if we have ( +   a)  = 0,
we have

( + ) ln det  =xab (cid:16)1(cid:17)ab
(a)ba =xa
(a)aa = xab

=xab (cid:16)1(cid:17)ab

( + ) ()ba

(g)ab  (g1)ba =  ln det g.

thus e = (det )  also solves equations 3.4, but now with g (det g). accord-

ingly, we dene the physical g as

gp = g

|k|2sk.

this terminates the derivation of the multipole solution.

4 outlook

we have veried that the solution generating method developed for the self-dual
yang-mills in four dimensions may be straighforwardly applied to our case. this
is yet another indication that the present system of symmetrised equations 2.2 is
indeed completely and explicitly integrable.

concerning the full yang-mills equations or equivalently the unsymmetrised
equations 1.101.12, any solution is also a solution of the symmetrised equations
2.2. thus we should be able to derive solutions of the latter which are general
enough so that we may impose that they be solutions of the former. this problem
is currently under investigation.
