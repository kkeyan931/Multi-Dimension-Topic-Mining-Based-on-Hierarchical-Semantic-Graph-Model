abstract

by making use of the path-integral duality transformation, string representation of the abelian-
projected su(3)-qcd with the -term is derived. besides the short-range (self-)interactions of
quarks (which due to the -term acquire a nonvanishing magnetic charge, i.e. become dyons) and
electric abrikosov-nielsen-olesen strings, the resulting eective action contains also a long-range
topological interaction of dyons with strings. this interaction, which has the form of the 4d gauss
linking number of the trajectory of a dyon with the world-sheet of a closed string, is shown to
become nontrivial at  6= 3  integer. at these values of , closed electric abrikosov-nielsen-
olesen strings in the model under study can be viewed as solenoids scattering dyons, which is the
4d analogue of the aharonov-bohm eect.

1 introduction

recently, by making use of the method of abelian projections [1], a remarkable progress in the
description of connement in qcd has been achieved (for a recent review see [2]). in this way,
most of the results have been obtained for the simplest case of the su(2)-group. that is because in
this case the respective cartan subgroup is just u(1). owing to this fact, under the assumptions
on the irrelevance of the o-diagonal degrees of freedom in the ir limit (the so-called abelian
dominance hypothesis) [3] and condensation of monopoles arising during the abelian projection,
the resulting eective theory takes the form of the dual abelian higgs model. in the latter model,
connement of external electrically charged particles is provided by the formation of electric
abrikosov-nielsel-olesen (ano) strings [4] between these particles. this is just the essence of
the t hooft-mandelstam scenario of connement [5].

besides this simplest su(2)-case, an eective [u(1)]2 gauge invariant abelian-projected the-
ory of the realistic su(3)-qcd, based on the abelian dominance hypothesis, has also been pro-
posed [6]. quite recently, conning properties of this model were investigated by a derivation of
its string representation [7] (for a review see [8]). moreover, in ref. [9] the collective eects in
the grand canonical ensemble of strings in this model were investigated. in particular, a crucial
dierence of this ensemble from the one of the su(2) abelian-projected theory [10] (following
from the appearance of two types of (self-)interacting strings in the su(3)-case) has been found.
the present letter is devoted to the investigation of abelian-projected su(3)-qcd extended
by the introduction of the -term. the relevance of this term to the instanton physics is a well
known issue, and we will not discuss it further, referring the reader to classical monographs (see
e.g. [11]). within our investigations, it will be demonstrated that the introduction of the -term
leads to the appearance of a long-range topological interaction of quarks (which due to this term
become dyons by acquiring a nonvanishing magnetic charge [12]) with the world-sheets of closed
electric ano strings. this interaction has the form of the gauss linking number of these objects
and can be interpreted as the 4d analogue [13] of the aharonov-bohm eect [14], where strings
play the role of solenoids, which scatter dyons.
in particular, it will be demonstrated that at
certain discrete critical values of  this eect disappears. this can be interpreted in such a way
that at these values of , the relation between the electric ux in the ano string (viewed as a
solenoid) and the magnetic charge of the dyon is so, that the scattering of dyons over strings is
absent. note that the long-range interaction of dyons with magnetic ano strings in the abelian
higgs model (which corresponds to the theory dual to the abelian-projected su(2)-qcd with
the -term) has been studied in ref. [15]. similar interaction of an external electrically charged
particle with magnetic ano strings in the same model but without -term has been found in
ref. [16] by the evaluation of the wilson loop describing this particle.

it will be also shown that, as it can be expected from the very beginning, besides this long-
range interaction of strings and dyons, the resulting eective action contains the short-range
(self-)interactions of these objects. the short-rangeness of all these interactions is due to the
(self-)exchanges of strings and dyons by massive dual gauge bosons. among these short-range
interactions, the selnteraction of the open world-sheets of strings, which end up at dyons, is the
most important one, since it is this interaction, which provides the linear growth of the conning
dyon-antidyon potential.

the organization of the letter is as follows. in the next section, we shall discuss an eective
theory of the abelian-projected su(3)-qcd with the -term. in section 3, a derivation of the
announced string representation for the partition function of this model will be presented, and the

2

obtained results will be briey discussed. finally, in three appendices, some technical details of
calculations, which are necessary for a derivation of the formulae from the main text, are outlined.

2 the model

in the present section, we shall discuss the model, whose string representation will be derived
below. to start with, let us consider the partition function of an eective [u(1)]2 gauge invariant
abelian-projected theory of the pure su(3)-gluodynamics (i.e. a theory without quarks and the
-term) [6]. it reads 1

xa=1(cid:20)|(  igmeab) a|2 + (cid:16)|a|2  2(cid:17)2(cid:21)#) .

(1)

here, a = |a| eia are the dual higgs elds, which describe the condensates of monopoles emerg-
ing after the abelian projection, and gm is the magnetic coupling constant related to the electric
one via the topological quantization condition gmg = 4k. in what follows, we shall for simplicity
restrict ourselves to the monopoles possessing the minimal charge only, i.e. set k = 1. next,
 are
just the diagonal components of the gluonic eld. on the r.h.s. of eq. (1), there have also been
introduced the so-called root vectors eas, which have the form

b is the magnetic potential dual to the electric potential a  (cid:16)a3

(cid:17), where a3,8

e1 = (1, 0) , e2 =

,

3
2 ! , e3 =

these vectors play the role of the structural constants in the rst of the following commutation
relations

[h, ea] = eaea,

[ea, eb] = 

1
2

abcec,

[ea, eb] = abeah.

in these relations, h  (h1, h2) = (t 3, t 8) are the diagonal su(3)-generators, which generate
the cartan subalgebra, where from now on t i = i
2 , i = 1, . . . , 8, are just the su(3)-generators
with is denoting the gell-mann matrices. we have also introduced the so-called step operators
eas (else called raising operators for positive as and lowering operators otherwise) by redening
the rest (non-diagonal) su(3)-generators as follows

1

e1 =

2 (cid:16)t 1  it 2(cid:17) , e2 =

2 (cid:16)t 4  it 5(cid:17) , e3 =

2 (cid:16)t 6  it 7(cid:17) .

1

1

(clearly, these operators are non-hermitean in the sense that (ea) = ea.)
it is also worth
noting that owing to the fact that the original su(3) group is special, the phases as of the dual

higgs elds are related to each other by the constraint

a = 0. this constraint was imposed

by introducing the corresponding -function into the r.h.s. of eq. (1).

1 throughout the present letter, all the investigations will be performed in the euclidean space-time.

in what follows, we shall be interested in the study of the model (1) in the london limit, i.e. the
limit of innitely large coupling constant  of the dual higgs elds (clearly, this limit corresponds
to the case of innitely large masses of the dual higgs bosons.). it is just this limit, where the
model under study allows for an exact reformulation in terms of the integral over closed electric
ano strings [7] 2. in the london limit, the radial parts of the higgs elds can be integrated out,
and the partition function (1) takes the form

since in the model (1) there exist string-like singularities of the ano type, in eq. (2) we have
decomposed the total phases of the dual higgs elds into multivalued and singlevalued (else oftenly
called singular and regular, respectively) parts, a = sing.
, and imposed the constraint of
vanishing of the sum of regular parts by introducing the integration over the lagrange multiplier
k(x). analogously to the dual abelian higgs model, in the model (2), sing.
s describe a certain
electric string conguration and are related to the closed world-sheets as of strings of three types
via the equation

this equation is nothing else, but the covariant formulation of the 4d analogue of the stokes
theorem for the gradient of the eld a, written in the local form. in eq. (3), x(a)()  x(a)
 () is a
vector, which parametrizes the world-sheet a with  = (1, 2) standing for the 2d coordinate. on
the other hand, the regular parts of the phases, reg.
s, describe a singlevalued uctuation around
the above mentioned given string conguration. note that owing to the one-to-one correspondence
between sing.
s is implied in the sense
of a certain prescription of the summation over string world-sheets. one of the possible concrete
forms of such a prescription, corresponding to the summation over the grand canonical ensemble
of virtual pairs of strings with opposite winding numbers, has been considered in refs. [9, 10]. it
is also worth noting that due to eq. (3) the integration measure over the full phases as can be
shown to become factorized into the product of measures over the elds sing.

as it was announced in the introduction, the model whose string representation will be of our
interest is not the london limit of pure abelian-projected su(3)-gluodynamics (2), but rather
the full su(3)-qcd extended by the -term. for a certain quark colour c = r, b, g (red, blue,
green, respectively), the partition function of such a theory reads [6]

3 aharonov-bohm eect and connement

in order to proceed with the string representation of the model (4), it is useful to employ the
so-called path-integral duality transformation (see e.g. ref. [17], where this transformation is
presented for the simplest case of the (dual) abelian higgs model), whose details are outlined in
appendix a. the result of this procedure reads 3

(xy)2 j(y), which precisely cancels the corresponding coulomb interaction

from physical principles, since in the resulting theory there does not remain any massless particles,
by which the quarks might exchange.

which is the main result of the present letter. notice that for every colour c, it is straightforward
to integrate one of the world-sheets as out of eq. (12) by resolving the constraint imposed by the
corresponding -function. this procedure leads to an obvious expression for the partition function
in terms of two independent string world-sheets.

the rst exponent on the r.h.s. of eq. (12) represents a short-ranged interaction of quarks,
which due to the -term have now acquired also a nonvanishing magnetic charge, i.e. became
dyons. clearly, the rst term in the second exponent on the r.h.s. of eq. (12) is the short-ranged
(self-)interaction of four dierent world-sheets: three closed ones as and an open one . this
term is responsible for the linearly rising potential, which connes dyons. upon the expansion in
powers of the derivatives w.r.t. as, this term yields the coupling constants of the local string
eective action (see the rst paper from ref. [7] for details). the second term is just the short-
range interaction of dyons and strings. the most nontrivial term in the obtained expression is the
last, third one, which describes a long-range interaction of dyons with closed world-sheets. such
an interaction represents the 4d-analogue of the aharonov-bohm eect [13], which means that
at  6= 3  integer (cf. the explicit form of the numbers s(c)
a s), the dyons become scattered by
the closed electric ano strings. contrary to that, these critical values of  correspond to such
a relation between the magnetic charge of a dyon and the electric ux inside the string when the
scattering is absent.

b. integration over the kalb-ramond fields

in this appendix, we shall present some details of a derivation of eq. (7) from the main text.
namely, we shall carry out the following functional integral over the kalb-ramond elds

(b.1)

clearly, such a gaussian integral can be calculated upon the substitution of its saddle-point value
back into the action. the saddle-point equation in the momentum representation reads

1

42 (cid:16)p2ha (extr.)



(p) + ppha (extr.)



(p) + ppha (extr.)



3g2
m
4

(p)(cid:17) +

ha (extr.)



(p) = i a

(p).

this equation can most easily be solved by rewriting it in the following way

(b.2)
where m = gm3 is just the mass of the dual gauge bosons, equal to the mass of the kalb-
ramond elds. in eq. (b.2), we have also introduced the following projection operators

(cid:16)p2 p, + m21,(cid:17) ha (extr.)

(p) = 4i2 a

(p),

(pp  pp) and 1,

(  )
p2 . these projection operators obey the following relations

with p    pp

1, = 1, = 1, = 1,, 1,1, = 1,

(the same relations hold for p,), and

(b.3)

(b.4)

p,(cid:16)1  p(cid:17),

= 0.

by virtue of the properties (b.3) and (b.4), the solution to the saddle-point equation (b.2) reads

ha (extr.)



(p) =

4i2

p2 + m2 "1 +

p2

m2 (cid:16)1  p(cid:17)#,

(p),

which, once being substituted back into the functional integral (b.1), yields for it the following
expression

p2 + m2 "1 +

rewriting now the term from eq. (b.5), which is proportional to the projection operator 1, in the
(y) from

coordinate representation we obtain the expression 222r d4xd4y a

the action standing in the exponent on the r.h.s. of eq. (7).

m (x  y) a

let us now consider the term proportional to the projection operator (cid:16)1  p(cid:17) on the r.h.s.

of eq. (b.5). in this way, by making use of the following equation

(x)d(4)

c. calculation of the integral (8)

below in this appendix, we shall present some details of a calculation of the integral (8). owing

a (cid:17)2
to eq. (5) and the fact that for every c, (cid:16)s(c)
k1(m|x  y|)

= 2, this integral can be rewritten as follows



x z d4z

j(z)
(x  z)2



y z d4u

j(u)

(y  u)2 .

(c.1)

next, by making use of the following sequence of partial integrations

|x  y|

=


x

k1(m|x  y|)

(x  z)2 ,

one can carry out the integration over z. after that, the integral (c.1) takes the form

m

22   g2

42 !2

m

z d4xd4uj(x)i(x  u)j(u),

(c.2)

|xy|(yu)2 is just the integral, which is left to be calculated.

where i(x  u)  r d4y k1(m|xy|)
z  y  u and introduce the vector   x  u, after which we obtain i() = r d4z k1(m|z|)

in order to proceed with this calculation, let us pass to the integration over the variable
1
z2 .
such an integral can most easily be carried out by substituting for the two ratios, which form the
integrand, the r.h.s.s of the following equalities

|z|

k1(m|z  |)

|z  |

=

m z

d4p
(2)4

eip(z)
p2 + m2 and

1

z2 = 42z

d4q

then we have

i() =

(c.3)

it is further convenient to introduce new integration variables a  [0, +) and t  [0, 1] according
to the formulae  = at and  = a(1  t). straightforward integration over t then reduces the
integral (c.3) to the following expression

i() =

2
m3

z0

a2 e 2

such an integral can be carried out by virtue of the formula

z0

x xdx = 2

k (cid:18)2q(cid:19) ,  > 0,  > 0,

and the result has the form

i() =

42

m3|| " 1

||  mk1(m||)# .

finally, substituting this expression into eq. (c.2), we arrive at eq. (9) of the main text.
