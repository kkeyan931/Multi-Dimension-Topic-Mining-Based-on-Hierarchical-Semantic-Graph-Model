abstract: we argue that one can understand the relationship between critical free-energy
densities of theories connected via non-perturbative renormalization group ows, in terms
of the the number of elds coupled to the class of dierent theories which ow into the
same stationary renormalization group trajectory. as an explicit example, we study the
free-energy density of bosonic and fermionic theories possessing strongly coupled critical
points in d = 3. we construct a stationary trajectory which interpolates between the
free massless theory of n scalars and a class of interacting theories including both bosons
and fermions. the free-energy along this trajectory remains constant, but the degrees of
freedom coupled to the underlying theories which ow into it are dierent. the dierence in
the degrees of freedom underlying two distinct points of the stationary trajectory, provides
a natural explanation for the rational relationship between the critical free-energy densities
of the free massless theory of n scalars and the o(n ) vector model.

1. introduction

the recent progress in our understanding of the microscopic origin of the thermodynamic
properties of black holes has sparked a renewed interest in the investigation of conformal
eld theories (cfts) at nite temperature. there have been a number of calculations [1, 2,
3, 4, 5] regarding the free-energy density of cfts emerging from ads/cft correspondence
[6, 7, 8]. these are particularly interesting, as the ads/cft correspondence probes the
strong-coupling regime of n = 4 sym4 for large-n . the free-energy obtained is found to
be 3/4 times the free-energy density of the same theory at its free-eld limit. such a result
still lacks a proper understanding since it is related to non-trivial d-dimensional conformal
eld theories, where d > 2, which are not well understood.

it has also been suggested in [9], following earlier work of [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], that the
free-energy density at criticality encodes important information for the rg-ow between
dierent xed points.1 in particular, it has been claimed in [9] that studies of the free-
energy density yield constraints regarding the low-energy spectrum of theories undergoing
symmetry-breaking transitions.

to get more insight into the signicance of the free-energy density at criticality, we
elaborate here on some remarkable results regarding the three-dimensional o(n ) vector
model and its fermionic counterpart, the gross-neveu model. these models have non-
trivial critical points at large-n which are strongly coupled and represent a symmetry-
breaking transition, making them important testing ground. a remarkable result is then

1for a dierent approach see [15].

1

that the leading-n free-energy density of the bosonic theory at its non-trivial critical point
is 4/5 times the free-energy density of the theory of n massless free scalars [12].

our purpose here is to provide some physical insight into the origin of this simple
relationship between the two critical points. to this end, we construct a theory of coupled
bosonic and fermionic elds. then, on the space of couplings we identify a stationary
trajectory which interpolates between the free massless theory of n scalars and a class of
interactive critical theories with an o(n/4) symmetry. the free-energy along this trajec-
tory does not change. its value remains equal to the free-energy of the theory of n massless
free scalars. at one end of the trajectory only four o(n/4) massless elds contribute and
therefore the underlying theory is that of n massless free scalars. we then nd a point on
the trajectory at which the underlying theory is that of ve copies of the o(n/4) vector
model. this result explains why the free-energy density at the non-trivial critical point of
the o(n ) vector model is 4/5 times the free-energy density of the free theory of n mass-
less scalars. our method is quite general and could in principle be used to studying other
theories which have strongly coupled critical points, such as n = 4 sym4 in the large-n
limit.

we organize our discussion as follows.

in section 2, we introduce the free-energy
density and briey discuss its properties. in section 3, we review the salient features of
the o(n ) vector model as well as the fermionic gross-neveu model. section 4 contains
our main calculation. we construct an interactive eld theory in three dimensions, making
use of the models in section 3. we show that this theory possesses stationary trajectories
along which the free-energy does not change. we identify a point on one of the trajectories
whose free-energy is manifestly 5/4 times the free-energy of the non-trivial critical point
of the o(n ) vector model. finally, in section 5, we present our conclusions.

2. general remarks on the free-energy density

consider a euclidean eld theory in s1  rd1 geometry with periodic boundary condi-
tions. such a theory is related to a d-dimensional statistical mechanical system in thermal
equilibrium, as the lattice spacing a  0. the free-energy density (free-energy per unit
volume), for the latter system can be written as [11]

f (l, g, a) = f0(g, a) 

1
ld c(l, g, a)

(2.1)

where the temperature is t = 1/l and g denotes collectively the bare coupling constants.
the term f0 is the free-energy density at zero temperature, or equivalently the bulk
free-energy density.

under the basic assumption that in the limit a  0 the statistical mechanical system
is described by a renormalizable qft, uv renormalization of f0 suces to render eq. (2.1)
nite. furthermore, one can write

where gr are dimensionless coupling constants and  is a mass scale. the subscript r
denotes the renormalized quantities. it is important to stress that the dimensionless quan-

c(l, g, a)  cr(gr, l)

(2.2)

2

tity l = l is not the standard rg scale since l1 is a physical mass scale not related
to the uv cut-o. nevertheless, as cr is an observable it should not depend on  and
should therefore satisfy the following rg equation (we drop the r subscript since we shall
henceforth deal only with renormalized physical quantities)


l

(cid:18)l

+ (g)



g(cid:19) c(g, l) = 0

(g) = 

g(l)


(2.3)

(2.4)

eq.(2.3) is solved [11] by the introduction of the inverse correlation length 1(g, l) =
m (g, l) which has dimensions of mass and obeys the following rg equation


l

(cid:18)l

+ (g)



g(cid:19) m (g, l) = 0

then, from eq. (2.3) and eq.(2.5) we may write

c(g, l)  c(m l)

(2.5)

(2.6)

denoting t = m l, then c(t) is a rg-invariant quantity.

the critical points of the theory correspond to certain values g of the coupling(s) such

that

(g) = 0

(2.7)

from eq. (2.5), this implies the existence of a critical inverse correlation length m = m (g)
and therefore of a critical value for c(t), t = ml. it can then be seen from eq. (2.3) and
eq. (2.5) that the possible values of the critical correlation length - which would correspond
to possible critical points of the theory - are given by the stationary points of c(t).

if eq. (2.7) has more than one solutions, they must correspond to dierent critical
points. the introduction of the length scale l, being essential for the existence of more that
one stationary points of c(t), provides the means of connecting the two theories owing to
the dierent critical points. these two critical points may in general have dierent massless
degrees of freedom coupled into them and one might be tempted to view them as uv and
ir critical points of the same theory. however, it is rather dicult to demonstrate the
existence of such a rg ow as it is in principle non-perturbative. an explicit example of
such a case is provided by the o(n ) 4 theory and the o(n ) vector model in d = 3. the
latter theory has a non-trivial uv xed point which has been argued to be the same as the
ir xed point of the former theory. this will be discussed in section 3.

nevertheless, eq. (2.3) can still provide important insight towards the understanding
of the rg ow between critical points having dierent massless degrees of freedom coupled
into them. the essential observation is that eq. (2.3) allows the construction of station-
ary ows connecting theories with dierent eld content.
indeed, had we been able to
construct a function c[t(t)] which is stationary for all values of t in a certain interval,
then, from eq. (2.7), this would correspond to a line of critical points parametrized by the
new parameter t. to all these critical points corresponds the same value of c, which is

3

essentially a constant, therefore they have the same massless degrees of freedom coupled
into them. in other words, t now parametrizes dierent underlying theories owing to the
same critical point. this way we are able to deduce simple relations between the degrees
of freedom coupled at the critical points of dierent theories.

we mentioned above that the quantity c(g, l) carries information for all the degrees of
freedom coupled to the theory at a certain rg-scale. the reason is that c(g, l) is related
to the energy momentum tensor. consider a system in a slab of length l with partition
function

zl = z d esl() = ef (l)

where f (l) is the free-energy normalized so that

under the coordinate change,

f () = 0

x  x + (x) , (x) = (cid:20) (cid:18)1 +

l

l (cid:19) x0,

x(cid:21) , x = (x1, .., xd1)

we have

sl  sl +

l

l zslab

ddx t00(x)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

if the partition function is at a xed point of the rg, it remains invariant under such a
change. this gives to leading order in l

zl = ef (l) = ef (l)l f

l  l

l rslab ddxht00(x)i

(2.12)

which gives the change of the free-energy in terms of the t00-component of the energy
momentum tensor as [10]

l

f
l

= zslab

ddxht00(x)i

using eq. (2.1), we then obtain

ht00i = (1  d)

c(g, l)

ld +

1
ld (g)


g

c(g, l)

(2.13)

(2.14)

relations such as eq. (2.14), acquire their full power in two dimensions where they lead to
the important result that c(g, l) at a critical point is proportional to the central charge of
the corresponding cft.

3. critical bosonic and fermionic theories in d = 3

in this section, we review o(n ) bosonic and u (n ) fermionic models in the large-n limit.

4

3.1 the o(n ) vector model

the lagrangian density for the o(n ) bosonic vector model is

l =

1
2

 ~   ~ + v (|~|)

(3.1)

where ~(x) = a(x), a = 1, 2, .., n is the o(n )-vector scalar eld, and v (|~|) is an in-
teraction potential whose explicit form is not important for our purposes. the partition
function in the large-n limit exhibits a universal behavior. this has been studied in the
case when

v (|~|) = (~  ~)2

and also when the vector eld is constrained by
~  ~ = 1

(3.2)

(3.3)

in the latter case, the lagrangian density may be written in terms of an auxiliary scalar
eld  as



(3.4)

l =

~  (2 + )~ +

g0

this theory possesses a non-trivial critical point at each order in a 1/n expansion, as the
coupling constant is kept xed [16, 17]. this critical point is uv-stable, corresponds to a
non-trivial three-dimensional cft and represents the o(n )  o(n  1) symmetry break-
ing transition. the critical theory is strongly coupled, since the 1/n expansion corresponds
to a resummation of an innite number of diagrams.

in the spirit of the suggestion in [9], we can measure the massless degrees of freedom
coupled to a critical theory if we heat it up to a temperature t = 1/l where we impose
periodic boundary conditions along euclidean time. this is equivalent to placing the theory
in a slab with one nite dimension of length l playing the role of inverse temperature.
starting from the lagrangian (3.4) and using a saddle point approximation, we obtain the
free energy density

f (l, g0) =

where p = (p1, p2) and s is the saddle-point value of the auxiliary eld  constrained by
the gap equation

(3.7)

where we introduced the cuto  to regulate the divergent integral. then the quantity
f (l) f (0) is nite, and can be written in terms of the renormalized coupling constant gr
via eqs. (3.6) and (3.7).

5

at a critical point, we have 1/gr  0. in that case, the gap equation (3.6) becomes

which has a non-trivial solution, s = m2

, where

ml = 2 ln

 =

1 + 5

2

(3.8)

(3.9)

at this critical point, the o(n ) vector model coupling stays at its zero temperature critical
value g, (this is sometimes referred to as the nite-size scaling regime [18]). one then
obtains the remarkable result [12]

c(g)

(3.10)

the simplicity of this result is due to some remarkable identities for the dilogarithm and
the trilogarithm at the special point eq. (3.9) [19] [see appendix].

as the free-energy density of a theory of n massless free scalars is

c0(g0)

n

=

(3)
2

(3.11)

one is tempted to conclude from eqs. (3.10) and (3.11) that, for large-n , the number
of massless degrees of freedom coupled to the non-trivial xed-point of the o(n ) vector
models, is 4/5 times the massless degrees of freedom coupled to the free-eld theory xed-
point. however, the strongly coupled critical theory is not related in an entirely obvious
way to the free-eld theory of n massless scalars. it has been argued [16] that the critical
uv-stable xed point of the o(n ) vector model is in the same universality class with the
ir-stable xed point of the o(n ) invariant 4 theory in 2 < d < 4. such a correspondence
is only valid at the critical regime when one can disregard an innite number of irrelevant
operators. therefore, the rg-ow from the free-eld theory of n massless bosons, (corre-
sponding to the uv-stable xed point of the o(n ) invariant 4 theory), to the ir-stable
xed point is non-perturbative. this means essentially that had we been able to obtain
the full solution of the rg-equations, the massless free theory would correspond to the
weak-coupling limit and the non-trivial critical theory eq. (3.10) to the strong coupling
limit.

3.2 the u (n ) gross-neveu model

another three-dimensional theory with a strongly coupled xed point is the u (n ) gross-
neveu model [16, 17].
its lagrangian is written is terms of an auxiliary scalar eld 
as

2

(3.12)

n
2g

l =  ( + ) +

6

where  = 1, 2, .., n 2 this theory has a uv-stable critical point at each order in the 1/n
expansion as the coupling g is kept xed. this critical point represents a space-parity
breaking transition.

placing the theory in a slab with one nite dimension of length l amounts to imposing
antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions along euclidean time. then, when the
coupling stays at its bulk critical value g the gap equation gives zero expectation value
for . this is a consequence of the absence of zero modes for fermions and antiperiodic
boundary conditions. it essentially means that c(g) for this model is given by the free-
eld theory result [20] and not by a complicated relation involving polylogarithms such as
eq. (3.10). therefore, for some time its was thought that nothing interesting happens in
three-dimensional fermionic models at the nite-size scaling regime.

however, it was recently discovered [21, 14] that certain three-dimensional fermionic
models do exhibit non-trivial behavior in the nite-size scaling regime. the theory dis-
cussed in [14] is the u (n ) gross-neveu model for xed total fermion number b. the xed
fermion number constraint is introduced into the theory via a delta function ( n  b),
where

n = z d2 x(x)(x) ,

x = (x1, x2)

(3.13)

is the fermion number operator. using an auxiliary scalar eld (x3) to impose the delta
function constraint, the action for this model is written in the slab geometry

s = zslab

( + i3 + ) +

n

2g zslab

2 + ibzslab



(3.14)

it was shown in [14] that for certain values of  the gap equation of the model yields a
non-zero expectation value for  when the coupling stays at the bulk critical value g.
consequently, c(g) is no longer given by the free eld theory result but by a non-trivial
expression involving polylogarithms as

(3.15)

(3.16)

where lin(r, ) is the real part of the polylogarithm lin(rei) and cln() is clausens
function [19]. an important observation of [14] is that for lhi =  the fermions acquire
periodic boundary conditions and the theory resembles the bosonic o(n ) vector model
discussed previously. in this case the expectation value of  is given by

2for the euclidean three-dimensional gamma matrices we use the hermitian two-dimensional represen-

tation 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3  0 = 3, with i, i = 1, 2, 3 the usual pauli matrices.

lhi = 2 ln 

(3.17)

(3.18)

i.e., minus twice the free-energy density of the o(n ) vector model. the interpretation of
a negative free-energy density may not be clear when one considers the model above by
itself. it is entirely justiable, however, when the model is viewed as part of a larger theory
containing both fermions and bosons as we discuss in the next section.

4. stationary trajectories and the free-energy density

the models described in section 3 are typical examples of strong-coupling dynamics in
qft. the low-energy critical theory is unreachable by a weak coupling expansion around
the uv-critical point and one needs to know the full analytic dependence of physical
quantities on the coupling constant to study both regimes. most importantly, the spectrum
of the theory changes in an uncontrollable way.

to understand the dierence between the massless degrees of freedom coupled to the
dierent critical regimes of the o(n ) model, we shall exploit the following idea. we shall
construct stationary ows which interpolate between critical theories with dierent eld
contents, one of which is the free-eld theory of n massless scalars. since the free-energy
density remains invariant along stationary ows, all such theories will have the same free-
energy density eq. (3.11). these theories may be interpreted as interacting theories of
massive scalar elds. then, the condition for stationary free-energy density implies denite
relations between the masses. for a set of special values of the masses, the resulting theory
is seen to be related to the strongly coupled critical theory eq. (3.10).

consider a theory in three dimensions with nine o(n/4) bosonic elds, ~i (i =
1, . . . , 9), and two u (n/4) fermionic elds ~j (j = 1, . . . , 4). these elds have masses
mi , (i = 1, . . . , 9) and mj , (j = 1, 2), respectively. the quadratic part of the lagrangian
density reads

l0 =

1

~i  (2 + m2

xj=1


j ( + mj )

j

(4.1)

where  = 1, 2, . . . , n/4. these elds interact, but we will not specify the interaction
lagrangian. furthermore, we may impose a xed total fermion number constraint as it
was discussed in section 3. this is quite natural since the total fermion number constraint
is equivalent to the presence of a background gauge eld [22, 23]. hence, the theory in
eq. (4.1) may be viewed as a three-dimensional massive gauge theory with bosons and
fermions. the full lagrangian density is

l = l0 + vint(~i , 
j )

(4.2)

where the interaction potential vint is a function of o(n/4) invariants made out of the
bosons and fermionic currents.

in the slab geometry bosons acquire periodic boundary conditions along the nite dimension

[14], or equivalently due to the some special conguration of the background gauge eld
[23], we can arrange so that fermions acquire periodic boundary conditions as well. then

corrections to this expression may come from the interactive part of the lagrangian
eq. (4.2) and are in general polynomials in the masses. as long as we are interested
in stationary trajectories, we will consider only marginal couplings which are trinomials in
the masses. we will add appropriate trinomials to obtain a free-energy which is invariant
along a certain trajectory in the space of couplings.

next, we discuss the behavior of the theory along the trajectory. the ow of the masses
is shown in fig. 1. to consider theories with real, non-negative masses, the parameter t
must be restricted to the interval

0  t 

1
2

(4.16)

along the trajectory, 0 < t < 1/2, we have o(n/4) symmetry. at the two ends, t = 0, 1/2,
we obtain enhanced mass degeneracy. there is also a special point in the interval (0, 1/2)
where mass degeneracy is enhanced and the symmetry group becomes o(5n/4).

as t  0, we have x1, x2, x3, x4, x9  0, as well as y1, y2  0. therefore, the bosonic
elds ~1, ~2, ~3, ~4, ~9 and all four fermionic elds become innitely massive and decouple.
the other four bosonic elds have xi  1 (i = 5, . . . , 8), so they all become massless.
therefore, in this limit we obtain 4(n/4) = n free massless bosonic elds. eq. (4.11)
becomes

c = c(0) = li3(1)

(4.17)

and the underlying theory which ows to the t = 0 point of the above stationary rg-ow
is the free theory of n massless bosons.

there is an interesting point in the interval 0  t  1

2 at which the masses are divided
into two sets, all masses in the same set converging to the same value. let  be the golden
mean

 2    1 = 0

,

 =

at t = 1/ 2 = 2   , we have

1 + 5

(4.19)

x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = x9 = 2  
1

y1 = y2 =

,

=

x5 = x6 = x7 = x8 =   1
1
=   1


at this point, eq. (4.11) becomes

 2  1

10

c =

4 (cid:18)li3(2   )  ln(2   )li2(2   ) +

ln3(2   )(cid:19)

(4.20)

however, this is nothing but 5/4 times eq. (3.10), the latter giving the free-energy of the
uv critical point of the o(n ) vector model. this means that the underlying theory owing
to the t = 2   point of the stationary ow above corresponds to 5/4 copies of the o(n )
vector model. consequently, the degrees of freedom coupled to the non-trivial uv critical
point of the o(n ) vector model are 4/5 times the degrees of freedom coupled to the free
massless theory of n scalars q.e.d.

5. discussion and outlook

in this work, we addressed the issue of non-perturbative rg ows connecting weakly and
strongly coupled xed-points of three-dimensional qfts. a quantity which encodes impor-
tant information for such xed points is the free-energy density. we briey discussed some
of its properties in section 3 and analyzed some old [12], and more recent [14] exact results
for the free-energy density of non-trivial, strongly coupled three-dimensional cfts in sec-
tion 4. we presented our main result in section 5, where we provided an explicit example
of a stationary trajectory interpolating between a class of critical three-dimensional qfts.
the crucial observation is that the interactive critical theory corresponding to a special
point of the trajectory is related to the non-trivial critical point of the three-dimensional
o(n ) vector model. this way, we provided a physical picture for the fact that the latter
critical theory seems to involve 4/5 times the number of massless degrees of freedom of
the free-eld theory of n massless scalars. our arguments are based on the observation
that the stationary points of the quantity c(t) correspond to possible critical points. the
introduction of the nite length l was also essential in order to obtain more than one
non-trivial stationary points for c(t).

along the stationary ow, we have a o(n/4) symmetry. at the two ends of the ow
(see fig. 1), we have enhanced mass degeneracy. at one end, we obtain 4(n/4) = n free
massless bosons; at the other end, we obtain an enhanced symmetry, o(5n/4) and the
model rolls to a non-trivial conformal eld theory. in obtaining the stationary trajectory
of eqs. (4.11) and (4.15) it was essential that the fermions in the lagrangian eq. (4.1)
acquire periodic boundary conditions. this is not unusual for fermions in gauge eld back-
grounds, as the zeroth component of the gauge eld plays the role of an imaginary chemical
potential. therefore, it is possible that for certain congurations of the background gauge
eld the fermions acquire a zero mode and are eectively bozonized contributing, how-
ever, a negative free-energy density [14, 23]. although the issue regarding the physical
interpretation of such a bosonization is not clearly settled as yet [24], we have explicitly
demonstrated its relevance to studies of non-perturbative rg ows.

our approach to studying the free-energy density of critical theories connected via
non-perturbative rg-ows could in principle be applied to other interesting cases, such as
the n = 4 sym4, in connection with the ads/cft correspondence. there, it is found that
the free-energy density of the n = 4 sym is 3/4 the free massless theory. this is a puzzle

11

with no apparent resolution. our results suggest that in order to address this issue, one
might try to construct a stationary ow, within the massless-free theory and see whether
at some point it becomes equal to 4/3 the free energy of a non-trivial cft. such an
extension of our results is expected to be more complicated, as the corresponding formulae
for the free-energy density of massive four-dimensional theories involve innite sums of
polylogarithms [25]. a further complication comes from the fact that the beta-function
of n = 4 sym4 is identically zero. therefore, neither the rg eq. (2.3), nor any kind
of weak-coupling expansion are sucient to studying the coupling constant dependence of
c(g, l). in this respect, all eorts towards understanding the non-perturbative nature of
n = 4 sym4 are worthwhile.

a. some polylogarithmic identities

here we present certain polylogarithm identities which we used in order to derive various
results earlier. for more details see [19].

the nth-order polylogarithm is dened by

lin(x) =

xk
kn

n

xk=1

we have lin(1) = (n).

the dilogarithm obeys the following identities:

li2(x) + li2(1  x) = li2(1)  ln x ln(1  x)

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

. setting x = 1/ in

li2(x) + li2(x) =
1  x(cid:19) = 

li2(x) + li2(cid:18) x

1
2

1
2

li2(x2)

ln2(1  x)

the golden mean plays a special role in these identities. let  = 1+5
the rst two identities (eqs. (a.2) and (a.3)), we obtain

2

3
2

li2(1/ 2)  li2(1/ ) = li2(1) 

1
2

ln  2

(a.5)

where we used  2    1 = 0. setting x = 1/ 2 in the third identity (eq. (a.4)), we obtain
(a.6)

ln2  2

li2(1/ 2)  li2(1/ ) = 

1
8

combining eqs. (a.5) and (a.6), we nally obtain

li2(1/ 2) =

2
5

li2(1) 

1
4

ln2  2

(a.7)

i.e., the dilogarithm can be expressed in terms of elementary functions at the special point
x = 1/ 2.

similarly, for the trilogarithm, the following identities hold:

li3(x) + li3(1 x) + li3(cid:18) x

1  x(cid:19) = li3(1) + li2(1) ln(1 x)

1
2

ln x ln2(1 x) +

li3(x) + li3(x) =

1
4

li3(x2)

1
6

ln3(1 x)
(a.8)

(a.9)

again, the golden mean plays a special role. to see this, set x = 1/ 2 in the rst identity
(eq. (a.8))

li3(1/ 2) + li3(1/ ) + li3(1/ ) = li3(1) +

1
2

li2(1) ln  2 

5
48

ln3  2

using the second identity (eq. (a.9)), we obtain

li3(1/ 2) =

4
5

li3(1) 

2
5

li2(1) ln  2 

1
12

ln3  2

(a.10)

(a.11)

13

which, in view of eq. (a.7), can be written as

li3(1/ 2) + li2(1/ 2) ln  2 

1
6

ln3  2 =

4
5

li3(1)

introducing the function

f(x) = li3(x)  li2(x) ln x +

1
6

ln3 x

we can write eq. (a.12) as (cf. eq. (3.10))

f(1/ 2) =

4
5 f(1) =

4
5

(3)

(a.12)

(a.13)

(a.14)

to show that the function eq. (4.11) is invariant under the ow eq. (4.14), set

x = t in eq. (a.8) and x = t

1t in eq. (a.9). combining the two equations, we obtain

li3(t) + li3(1  t) +

1
4

li3(t2/(1  t)2)  li3(t/(1  t))

= li3(1) + li2(1) ln(1  t) 

1
2

ln t ln2(1  t) +

1
6

ln3(1  t)

now dene the symmetric function (cf. eq. (4.12))

v(x, y) =

1
3

ln3 x 

after some algebra, we obtain

c =

xi=1v(xi , xi+4) = li3(1)

(a.15)

(a.16)

(a.17)

where the xi (i = 1, . . . , 9), y1, y2 are given by eq. (4.14). eq. (a.17) implies stationary
ow (cf. eq. (4.15)),

dc
