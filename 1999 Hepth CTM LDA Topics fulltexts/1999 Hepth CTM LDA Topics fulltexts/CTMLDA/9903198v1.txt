abstract. the general method of the supersymmetrization of the soliton equations with
the odd (bi) hamiltonian structure is established. new version of the supersymmetric
n=2,4 (modied) korteweg de vries equation is given, as an example. the second odd
hamiltonian operator of the susy kdv equation generates the odd n=2,4 susy virasoro
- like algebra.

1 introduction

the kadomtsev-petviashvili (kp) hierarchy of integrable soliton nonlinear evolution equa-
tions [1,2,3] is among the most important physically relevant integrable systems. one of
the main reasons for the interest in the kp hierarchy in the last few years originates from
its deep connection with the matrix models providing non - perturbative formulation of
string theory [4]. the relations between integrable models and conformal symmetries have
been studied intensely since 1984 [5,6]. qutie recently a new class of integrable systems
motivated by the toda eld theory appeared both in the mathematical [7] and in the
physical literature [8].

on the other side the applications of the supersymmetry (susy) to the soliton theory
provide us a possibility of the generalization of the integrable systems. the supersymmet-
ric integrable equations [8-20] have drown a lot of attention in recent years for a variety of
reasons. in order to get a supersymmetric theory we have to add to a system of k bosonic
equations kn fermions and k(n-1) boson elds (k=1,2,..n=1,2,..) in such a way that the
nal theory becomes susy invariant. interestingly enough, the supersymmetrizations,
leads to new eects (not present in the bosonic solitons theory). in particular the roots
for the susy lax operator are not uniquely dened [15,20], there is no bosonic reduction
to the classical equations [21] and the non-local conservation laws [22] appeare. these

eects rely strongly on the hamiltonian description of the supersymmetrical integrable
systems.

in this paper we would like to describe a new method of the n = 2 supersymmetriza-
tion of the modied korteweg de vries (mkdv) and korteweg de vries (kdv) equations.
as the result our super - equations are connected with the complex version of the soliton
equations. for this reason this method could be compared with the supercomplexication.
we show that it is possible to construct, for the susy mkdv equation, the supersymmet-
ric lax operator. this operator however does not generate the supersymmetric conserved
currents dened in the whole superspace. we introduce new miura transformations which
allow to supersymmetrize the kdv

the susy kdv equation, considered in this paper constitue a bi-hamiltonian equation
and is completely integrable. the poisson tensors and the hamiltonians of the supercom-
plexied version of the mkdv and kdv are superfermionic (odd) objects. the second
hamiltonian operator of the supercomplexied kdv equation generates some odd n = 2
susy algebra in contrast to the even algebra (susy n = 2 virasoro algebra) of the
supersymmetric version of the kdv equation considered in [12,14]. we use therefore the
name the odd susy virasoro - like algebra in order to distinguish it from the even susy
virasoro algebra of [12,14].

this supercomplexication is a general method and could be applied to the n = 2
susy case as well. indeed, in this case, we obtained a new n = 4 susy kdv equation
with an odd bihamiltonian structure. the model proposed in this paper, diers from the
one considered in [14,17].

the idea of introducing an odd hamiltonian structure is not new. leites noticed almost
20 years ago [23], that in the superspace one can consider both even and odd sympletic
structures, with even and odd poisson brackets respectively. the odd brackets (also known
as antibrackets) have recently drown some interest in the context of brst formalism in
the lagrangian framework [24], in the supersymmetrical quantum mechanics [25], and in
the classical mechanics [26,27]. the present paper proposes some new examples of the
odd sympletic structure with the n = 2, 4 supersymmetry.

in section 4 we present the supercomplexication of the mkdv equation.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we give a brief descriptions of the
(complex) (m)kdv equations. in section 3 the basic supersymmetric notation is intro-
duced.
in
particular the lax formulation, the odd bihamiltonian structure, and the superfermionic
conserved currents are described. section 5 contains supercomplexications of the kdv
equation. we describe the odd bihamiltonian structure and dene the hereditary recur-
sion operator. the realization of the odd susy virasoro - like algebra in terms of the
solutions of the supercompexied kdv equation is given. the last section contains the
supercomplexication of the n = 2 susy kdv equation.

p2 = 3 + 4h1h,

h1 =

the conserved currents for the mkdv equation can be obtained using the trace formula

hn = t rl

2n+1

,

(6)

where t r denotes the coecients standing in the front of 1 in the pseudodierential
element l

. in the following we shall also use the third conserved current

h3 =

1

2 z dx(cid:16)hxxxxh + 2h6  5h2

xh2  5hxxh3(cid:17).

(7)

the complex mkdv equation can be obtained from the mkdv equation assuming that
h = g + if , where g = g(x, t), f = f (x, t) are new functions. inserting this expansion in
the mkdv equation we obtain

(9)

gt = (cid:16)  gxx + 2g3  6f 2g(cid:17),
ft = (cid:16)  fxx  2f 3 + 6g2f(cid:17).

our complex mkdv equations constitute the bi-hamiltonian system. this structure could
be extracted from the usual bi-hamiltonian structure of mkdv equation using expansion
of h = g + if . we have twice as much currents in the complex case. they are given as
the real and the complex part of (5,7). for the rst two conserved currents (5) we have

h1r = z dx(g2  f 2), h1z = z dx(gf ),

h2r = z dx(cid:16)gxxg  fxxf + g4  6g2f 2 + f 4(cid:17),
h2z = z dx(cid:16)2gxxf + 4g3f  4gf 3(cid:17).

the mkdv equation is related to the famous kdv equation

wt := wxxx + 6wwx,

(10)

(11)

(12)

by the miura transformation

w := hx + h2.

the bihamiltonian structure of the kdv equation is

p2 := 3 + 2w + 2w.

p2 is the so called second hamiltonian operator which generates the virasoro algebra
[5,6]. it is connected with the rst hamiltonian operator of the mkdv equation via [3]

p2 :=

w = s + iu where s and u are new functions. one gets the system of two equations

st = (cid:16)  sxx + 3s2  3u2(cid:17),
ut = (cid:16)  uxx + 6su(cid:17).

using the same expansion of w it is also possible to obtain the lax representation and
the bi-hamiltonian structure of the complex kdv equation. we have the following bi-ha-
miltonian structure of the equations (18-19):

where (, )t denotes the transposition, while h1r and h2r are the real parts of the hamil-
tonians (15).

3 supersymmetric notations

we shall consider an n = 2 superspace with the space coordinates x and the grassman
coordinates 1, 2, 21 = 12, 2
2 = 0. the so called extended supersymmetry
is assumed for which the superelds are superfermions or superbosons. their taylor
expansions with respect to  take the form

1 = 2

u(x, 1, 2) = u0(x) + 11(x) + 22(x) + 21u1(x),

(21)

4

where the elds uo, u1 are interpreted as bosons (fermions) for the superboson (super-
fermion) eld, while 1, 2 as fermions (bosons) for the superboson (superfermion) eld,
respectively. the supersymmetric covariant derivatives are dened by

 =

1

+ 1, d2 =


2

+ 2,

with the properties

d2

1 = d2
d1

1

2 = , d1d2 + d2d1 = 0.
:= d11, d1
2

:= d21,

where 1 is dened as the formal series

1f = f 1  fx2 + fxx3  ...,

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

we shall use below the following notation: (dif ) denotes the outcome of the action

of the superderivative on the supereld f , while dif denotes the action itself.

we dene the integration over the n = 2 superspace to be

z dxh(x, 1, 2) = z dxd1d2h(x, 1, 2),

where berezins convention are assumed

z dij := i,j,

z di := 0.

(26)

(27)

we always assume that the components of the superleds and their derivatives vanish
rapidly enough. then

z dx(d1u) = z dx211x = z dx1x = 0,

and similarly for (d2u) where u is an arbitrary superfunction vanishing at .

reads

ut = uxxx  2u 3

x + 6(d1d2u)2ux.

(32)

where  1 denotes the projection onto the purely superdierntial part of the pseudosuper-
symmetric element.

this equation has several surprising properties. first, let us notice that introducing

new superelds

g := (d1d2u),

f := ux,

(33)

the supersymmetric mkdv equation can be rewritten as the complex mkdv equation
(8-9). this supersymmetric mkdv equation is however not equivalent with the complex
mkdv since we have to take into account the constraint (33).

the bosonic components of the susy mkdv equation lead to the following system

of equations (u = u0 + 11 + 22 + 21u1)

u0t = u0xxx  2u3

0x + 6u2

1u0x,

(34)

(35)

u1t = (cid:16)  u1xx + 2u3

1  6u2

0xu1(cid:17).

notice that the boson elds do not interact with the fermion ones because there are

no such in (34-35). however, the fermion elds interact with boson elds

1t = 1xxx + 61xu1 + 62u0x,
2t = 2xxx  61xu0x + 62xu1.

(36)
(37)

this way of the supersymmetrization we shall call in the following the supercomplexi-
cation. the method is based on the following trick: we rst replace the classical function
in the equations of motion by (d1d2f ) + ifx where f is some n = 2 supereld, then we
extract the equation on f and the (bi) hamiltonian structure with its hamiltonians.

the most surprising property of the supercomplexied mkdv equation is that the
conserved currents of the complex mkdv equation (10-11) are not conserved currents
of the supersymmetric mkdv (32) equation if they are dened in the whole superspace.
indeed if we change the usual integration in (10-11) to superintegration (dx  dx) and
assume the constraint (33) then the currents (10-11) vanishes.

it should be stressed, that the classical currents are conserved quantities for the su-
percomplexied mkdv equation if they are dened only in the usual space. in order to
solve the problem of conserved currents dened in the whole superspace we have checked
that our system does not have any superbosonic conserved currents up to fth conformal
dimension.
it was veried using the computer algebra [29,30] and assuming the most
general form for currents. the lax operator (30) does not produce any superbosonic
conserved currents also.

this observation may suggest that this system is not (bi) hamiltonian on the super-
space. there is still a possibility of a superfermionic hamiltonian operator and super-
fermionic conserved currents. it turns out that such situation occure in our case. one
can construct two superfermionic currents

the hamiltonian operator d1

2 denes a closed two-form (d1

i ), i = 1, 2

(d1

i )(a, b) := z dxad1

i b = (d1

i )(b, a).

where a and b are arbitrary odd vector elds.
although the hamiltonian operators d1

are not o(2) invariant in the su-
perspace, (as the hamiltonians h14 and h24), they are superpartners. one can restore the
o(2) invariance considering their linear combinations. the operator p1 := d1
is
invariant under o(2) transformation and generates the same susy mkdv equation with
the hamiltonian h14  h24.

and d1

there are two dierent second hamiltonian operators for the supercomplexied

mkdv equation:

+4(d1d2u)1(d1d2u)d1  4ux1uxd1,

:= d2 + 4(d1d2u)1uxd1 + 4ux1(d1d2u)d1

+4(d1d2u)1(d1d2u)d2  4ux1uxd2.

(42)

(43)

the proof that these operators dene a closed two - form is postponed to the next section.
let us now explain the derivation of the superfermionic conserved currents (38-39). we
assume, in the rst step of the calculations, the ansatz (33) and use the special computer
program [29,30] 2 in order to compute the usual integral of the conserved currents of
the complex mkdv equation. the next step is to compute the integral (d1
1 ) from the
nonitegrable part of the rst integration. the integrable part yields the rst series of
conserved currents. the computation of (d1
2 ) for the nonintegrable part of the second
integration leads to a purely integrable result which gives the second series of conserved
currents. symbolically this procedure could be expressed as follows:

z dxh  k0 +z dxk1,

(d1

1 k1)  h1 + (d1

1 s1),

(d1

2 s1)  h2.

(44)

(45)

if we change the order of supersymmetric integration in (45) then the new h1 and h2

are equivalent to the old one, modulo the superintegrable term.

2a new version of the program described in [30], allowing integrating the superfunctions, will appeare

in the new edition of reduce 3.7 april 15 1999.

7

the rst classical conserved current of the complex mkdv equation yields

h12 := z dx(d1u)ux, h22 := z dx(d2u)ux.

(46)

our convention for indices of hij is as follows: j denotes the conformal dimension of
the classical current, and i = 1, 2 denotes the index of the supersymmetric integrations.
for the second classical current we got the formulae (38-39) while for the third classical
current we got

h16

(47)

the superpartner h26 can be obtained from (47) using the o(2) transformation.

5 supersymmetric n=2 kdv equation, odd bihamil-

tonian structure, odd virasoro - like algebra

the supersymmetric generalizations of the kdv equation based on the supersymmetric
version of the virasoro algebra were considered in [11-16]. the hamiltonian operator
generating this super equation is

p2 := d1d2 + 2 + 2  d1d1  d2d2,

(48)

where  = (x, 1, 2) is a superboson function. the susy n = 2 kdv equation is the
following one parameter family of super-hamiltonian evolution equation

t = p2

(  1)(d1d22) + 3(cid:17),

(49)

(50)

where  is an arbitrary constant. it was show in [12,13,16] that only for three values of
the parameter  = 2, 1, 4 this system is integrable and possesses the lax representation.
the bihamiltonian structure of this generalization was considered in [15].

we show below that it is possible to construct a new bihamiltonian supersymmetric

generalization of the kdv equation using our supercomplexied method. the result is

wt := wxxx + 6(d1d2w )wx,

(51)

where w is the superbosonic function.

the supersymmetric generalization of the mkdv equation considered in the previous
section is connected with this susy kdv equation by the following miura transformation

w := ux + 2z dx(d1d2u)ux.

(52)

8

the bosonic limit of (51) in which w = w0 + 21w1 yields the classical kdv equation

when w0 = 0. moreover introducing

s := (d1d2w ),

u := wx,

(53)

the susy kdv equation (51) reduces to the complex kdv equation (18-19). however,
due to the constraint (53) this super equation and the complex kdv equation are not
equivalent to each other.

one may expect that our susy kdv equation should share the same properties as the
susy mkdv equation. indeed from the knowledge of the rst hamiltonian structure of
the supercomplexied mkdv and the miura transformation (52) it is possible to obtain
two dierent second hamiltonian operators

d1  21(d1d2w )d1  2(d1d2w )1d1 + 21wxd2 + 2wx1d2,

p21 :=

these operators generate the susy kdv equation (51)

where

h12 =

2 z dxw (d1wx), h22 = 

2 z dxw (d2wx).

it is also possible to obtain the hamiltonian operators p21, p22 in a dierent manner.
for this pourpose one can supercomplexify the formula (20) and extend the gradient of
the hamiltonian to the whole superspace

where

h1r =

now it is easy to check that these hamiltonian operators dene the closed two - forms. the
same is true for the supercomplexied bi-hamiltonians operators of the mkdv equation.

it is possible to dene two rst hamiltonian operators:

generating the same equation

p11 := d1

p12 := d1

wt := p11

x  (d1d2w )2(cid:17).

(62)

(63)

we can construct an o(2) invariant bihamiltonian structure considering the linear
combination of p11  p12, p21  p22 with h12  h22, h14  h24. these structures dene
the same susy kdv (51).

notice that the operators p21, p22 or p21  p22 play the same role as the virasoro
algebra in the usual kdv equation. there is a basic dierence - our hamiltonian operators
generate the odd poisson brackets in the odd superspace. in order to obtain the explicit
realization of this algebra we connect the hamiltonian operator p21 p22 with the poisson
bracket

{w (x, 1, 2), w (y,

unfortunately we did not nd any lax representation for the superxomplexied kdv
equation. in order to obtain higher currents we followed the method used in the soliton

10

theory. in this theory one can apply the so called recursion operator, constructed out of
the bihamiltonian operators r := p2p 1
, to the derivation of the conserved quantities.
this operator genrates the currents if it is hereditary [3,31].

in general r1 and r2 are hereditary operators. clearly p11 and p21 or p12 and p22 are

compatible. indeed the deformation

where ,  are arbitrary constants while 1, 2 are arbitrary grassmanian constants, maps
p21 or p22 into the hamiltonian operator p21  4p11 or p22  4p12. hence the resulting
recursion operators r1 and r2 are hereditary [3,31]. in this sense the susy kdv equation
(51) is completely integrable.

6 supercomplexied n=4 kdv equation

let us now apply our supercomplexication method to the n = 2 susy kdv equation.
we consider the case  = 4 only. other cases can be considered in an analogous way. we
assume that the supereld  satisfying the n = 2 susy kdv equation (48) takes after
the supercomplexication the following form

where d3 = 
3
this form in (48) we obtain

:= xxx + 3(d1d2 (x(d3d4))) + 3(cid:16)x(d4) + (d3d4)(d1d2x)(cid:17)

this is our bihamiltonian formulation of the equation (78). using the same methods
as in the previous sections it is possible to obtain an explicit realization of the odd susy
n = 4 virasoro - like algebra.

let us remark that the supercomplexication of the n = 1 susy kdv equation gives

the even bihamiltonian structure of the n = 3 susy kdv equation.
