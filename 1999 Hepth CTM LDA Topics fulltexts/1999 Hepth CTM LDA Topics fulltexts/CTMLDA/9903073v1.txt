1 early history of the rg in the qft

1.1 the birth of bogoliubovs renormalization group.

in the spring of 1955 a small conference on quantum electrodynamics and elementary
particle theory was organized in moscow.
it took place at the lebedev institute in the
rst half of april. among the participants there were several foreigners, including hu ning
and gunnar kallen. landaus survey lecture fundamental problems in qft, in which
the issue of ultraviolet (uv) behaviour in the qft was discussed, constituted the central
event of the conference. not long before, the problem of short-distance behaviour in qed
was advanced substantially in a series of articles [1] by landau, abrikosov, and khalatnikov.
they succeeded in constructing a closed approximation of the schwingerdyson equations,
which admitted an explicit solution in the massless limit and, in modern language, it resulted
in the summation of the leading uv logarithms.

the most remarkable fact was that this solution turned out to be selfcontradictory from
the physical point of view because it contained a ghost pole in the renormalized amplitude
of the photon propagator or, in terms of bare notions, the diculty of zero physical charge.
at that time our meetings with nicolai nicolaevich bogoliubov (n.n. in what follows)
were regular and intensive because we were tightly involved in the writing of nal text1
of our big book. n.n. was very interested in the results of landaus group and proposed
me to consider the general problem of evaluating their reliability by constructing, e.g., the
second approximation (including next-to-leading uv logs) to the schwingerdyson equations,
to verify the stability of the uv asymptotics and the very existence of a ghost pole.

shortly after the meeting at the lebedev institute, alesha abrikosov told me about gell
mann and lows article[3] which had just appeared. the same physical problem was treated
in this paper, but, as he put it, it was hard to understand and to combine it with the results
obtained by the landau group.

i looked through the article and presented n.n. with a brief report on the methods and
results, which included some general assertions on the scaling properties of the electron charge
distribution at short distances and rather cumbersome functional equations  see, below,
section 1.3.

n.n. immediate comment was that gellmann and lows approach is very important:
it is closely related to the la groupe de normalisation discovered a couple of years earlier
by stueckelberg and petermann [4] in the course of discussing the structure of the nite
arbitrariness in the scattering matrix elements arising upon removal of the divergences. this
group is an example of the continuous groups studied by sophus lie. this implied that
functional group equations similar to those of paper [3] should take place not only in the uv
limit but also in the general case as well.

within the next few days i succeeded in recasting dysons nite transformations and
obtaining the desired functional equations for the qed propagator amplitudes, which have
group properties, as well as the group dierential equations, that is, the sophus lie equations

1 just at that time the rst draft of a central part of the book has been published [2] in the form of two
extensive papers.

of the renormalization group (rg). each of these resulting equations  see, below eqs.(3
 contained a specic object, the product of the squared electron charge  = e2 and the
transverse photon propagator amplitude d(q2). we named this product, e2(q2) = e2d(q2),
the invariant charge. from the physical point of view this function is an analogue of the
socalled eective charge of an electron, rst discussed by dirac in 1933 [5], which describes
the eect of the electron charge screening due to quantum vacuum polarization. also, the
term renormalization group was rst introduced in our doklady akademii nauk sssr
publication [6] in 1955 (and in the english language paper [7]).

at the abovementioned lebedev meeting gunnar kallen presented a paper written with
pauli on the socalled lee model, the exact solution of which contained a ghost pole (which,
in contrast to the physical one corresponding to a bound state, had negative residue) in the
nucleon propagator. kallenpaulis analysis led to the conclusion that the lee model is
physically void.

in view of the argument on the presence of a similar pole in the qed photon propagator
(which follows from the abovementioned solution of landaus group as well as from an in-
dependent analysis by fradkin [8]) obtained in moscow, kallens report resulted in a heated
discussion on the possible inconsistency of qed. in the discussion kallen argued that no
rigorous conclusion about the properties of sum of an innite nonconvergent series can be
drawn from the analysis of a nite number of terms.

nevertheless, before long a publication by landau and pomeranchuk (see, e.g., the review

paper[9]) appeared arguing that not only qed but also local qft were selfcontradictory.

without going into details, remind that our analysis of this problem carried out [10] with
the aid of the rg formalism just appeared led to the conclusion that such a claim cannot
have the status of a rigorous result, independent of perturbation theory.

1.2 renormalization and renormalization invariance.

as is known, the regular formalism for eliminating ultraviolet divergences in quantum eld
theory (qft) was developed on the basis of covariant perturbation theory in the late 40s.
this breakthrough is connected with the names of tomonaga, feynman, schwinger and some
others. in particular, dyson and abdus salam carried out the general analysis of the structure
of divergences in arbitrarily high orders of perturbation theory. nevertheless, a number of
subtle questions concerning so-called overlapping divergences remained unclear.

an important contribution in this direction based on a thorough analysis of the mathe-
matical nature of uv divergences was made by bogoliubov. this was achieved on the basis of
a branch of mathematics which was new at that time, namely, the sobolevschwartz theory
of distributions. the point is that propagators in local qft are distributions (similar to the
dirac deltafunction) and their products appearing in the coecients of the scattering matrix
expansion require supplementary denition in the case when their arguments coincide and lie
on the light cone. in view of this the uv divergences reect the ambiguity in the denition
of these products.

in the mid 50ies on the basis of this approach bogoliubov and his disciples developed a
technique of supplementing the denition of the products of singular stueckelbergfeynman
propagators [2] and proved a theorem [11] on the niteness and uniqueness (for renormalizable

3

theories) of the scattering matrix in any order of perturbation theory. the prescription part
of this theorem, namely, bogoliubovs r-operation, still remains a practical means of obtaining
nite and unique results in perturbative calculations in qft.

the bogoliubov algorithm works, essentially, as follows:
 to remove the uv divergences of one-loop diagrams, instead of introducing some reg-
ularization, for example, the momentum cuto, and handling (quasi) innite counterterms,
it suces to complete the denition of divergent feynman integral by subtracting from it
certain polynomial in the external momenta which in the simplest case is reduced to the rst
few terms of the taylor series of the integral.

 for multi-loop diagrams (including ones with overlapping divergencies) one should rst

subtract all divergent subdiagrams in a hierarchical order regulated by the roperator.

the uniqueness of computational results is ensured by special conditions imposed on
them. these conditions contain specic degrees of freedom (related to dierent renormaliza-
tion schemes and momentum scales) that can be used to establish the relationships between
the lagrangian parameters (masses, coupling constants) and the corresponding physical quan-
tities. the fact that physical predictions are independent of the arbitrariness in the renormal-
ization conditions, that is, they are renorminvariant, constitutes the conceptual foundation
of the renormalization group.

an attractive feature of this approach is that it is free from any auxiliary nonphysical
attributes such as bare masses, bare coupling constants, and regularization parameters which
turn out to be unnecessary in computations employing bogoliubovs approach. as a whole,
this method can be regarded as renormalization without regularization and counterterms.

1.3 the discovery of the renormalization group.

the renormalization group was discovered by stueckelberg and petermann [4] in 1952-1953 as
a group of innitesimal transformations related to a nite arbitrariness arising in the elements
of the scattering s-matrix upon elimination of the uv divergences. this arbitrariness can be
xed by means of certain parameters ci:

... we must expect that a group of innitesimal operators pi = (/ci)c=0, exists,
satisfying

pis = hi(m, e)s(m, e, ...)/e ,

admitting thus a renormalization of e.

these authors introduced the normalization group generated (as a lie group) by the innites-
imal operators pi connected with renormalization of the coupling constant e.

in the following year, on the basis of dysons transformations written in the regularized
form, gell-mann and low [3] derived functional equations for qed propagators in the uv
limit. for example, for the renormalized transverse part d of the photon propagator they
obtained an equation of the form

d  k2

2 , e2

2! =

dc(k2/m2, e2
1)
dc (2/m2, e2
1)

4

, e2

2 = e2

1dc(2/m2, e2

1) ,

(1)

where  is the cuto momentum and e2 is the physical electron charge. the appendix to this
article contains the general solution (obtained by t.d.lee) of this functional equation for the
photon amplitude d(x, e2) written in two equivalent forms:

e2d(cid:16)x, e2(cid:17) = f (cid:16)xf 1(cid:16)e2(cid:17)(cid:17) ,

ln x =

e2d

ze2

dy
(y)

,

(2)

with

(e2) =

(e2d)
 ln x

at x = 1 .

a qualitative analysis of the behaviour of the electromagnetic interaction at small distances
was carried out with the aid of (2). two possibilities, namely, innite and nite charge
renormalizations were pointed out:

our conclusion is that the shape of the charge distribution surrounding a test
charge in the vacuum does not, at small distances, depend on the coupling constant
except through the scale factor. the behavior of the propagator functions for
large momenta is related to the magnitude of the renormalization constants in
the theory. thus it is shown that the unrenormalized coupling constant e2
0/4hc,
which appears in perturbation theory as a power series in the renormalized coupling
constant e2
it may really be innite as perturbation theory indicates;
it may be a nite number independent of e2

1/4hc with divergent coecients, many behave either in two ways:

1/4hc.

note, that the latter possibility corresponds to the case when  vanishes at a nite point:
() = 0. here,  is known now as a xed point of the renormalization group transfor-
mations.

the paper [3] paid no attention to the group character of the analysis and the results
obtained there. the authors failed to establish a connection between their results and the
standard perturbation theory and did not discuss the possibility that a ghost pole might exist.
the nal step was taken by bogoliubov and shirkov [6, 12]  see also the survey [7]
published in english in 1956. using the group properties of nite dyson transformations
for the coupling constant and the elds, these authors derived functional group equations
for the propagators and vertices in qed in the general case (that is, with the electron mass
taken into account). for example, the equation for the transverse amplitude of the photon
propagator and electron propagator amplitude were obtained in the form

d(x, y; e2) = d(t, y; e2)d(cid:18) x

t

,

y
t

; e2d(t, y; e2)(cid:19) , s(x, y; e2) = s(t, y; e2)s(cid:18) x

t

,

y
t

; e2d(t, y; e2)(cid:19)

(3)
in which the dependence not only on momentum transfer x = k2/2 (where  is a certain
normalizing scale factor), but also on the mass variable y = m2/2 is taken into account.

as can be seen, the product e2d of electron charge squared and photon propagator am-
plitude enters in both functional equations. this product is invariant with respect to dyson
transfermation. we called this function  invariant charge.

5

in the modern notation, the rst equation (which in the massless case y = 0 is equivalent
to (1)) is an equation for the invariant charge (now widely known as an eective or running
coupling)  = d(x, y;  = e2):

(x, y; ) =  (x/t, y/t; (t, y; )) .

(4)

let us emphasize that, unlike in the ref.[3] approach, in our case there are no simplications
due to the massless nature of the uv asymptotics. here the homogeneity of the transfer
momentum scale is violated explicitly by the mass m. nevertheless, the symmetry (even
though a bit more complex one) underlying the renormalization group, as before, can be
stated as an exact symmetry of the solutions of the quantum eld problem  see eq. (11)
below. this is what we mean when using the term bogoliubovs renormalization group or
renorm-group for short.

the dierential group equations (dges) for  and for the electron propagator:

(5)

(6)

were rst derived in [6] by dierentiating the functional equations. in this way an explicit
realization of the dges mentioned in the citation from [4] was obtained. these results estab-
lished a conceptual link with the stueckelbergpetermann and gell-mann  low approaches.

1.4 creation of the rg method

another important achievement of paper [6] consisted in formulating a simple algorithm for
improving an approximate perturbative solution by combining it with the lie dierential
equations (modern notation is used in this quotation from [6]):

formulae (5) show that to obtain expressions for  and s valid for all values of
their arguments one has only to dene (, y, ) and s(, y, ) in the vicinity of
 = 1. this can be done by means of the usual perturbation theory.

in our adjacent publication [12] this algorithm was eectively used to analyse the uv and

infrared (ir) asymptotic behaviour in qed. the one-loop and two-loop uv asymptotics

rg(x; )  (1)

rg(x, 0, ) =

of the photon propagator as well as the ir asymptotics

s(x, y; )  (x/y  1)3/2 = (p2/m2  1)3/2

of the electron propagator in transverse gauge were obtained. at that time these expressions
had already been known only at the oneloop level. it should be noted that in the mid 50s
the problem of the uv behaviour in local qft was quite urgent. as it has been mentioned
already a substantial progress in the analysis of qed at small distances was made by landau
and his collaborators [1]. however, landaus approach did not provide a prescription for
constructing subsequent approximations.

an answer to this question was found only within the new renormgroup method. the
simplest uv asymptotics of qed propagators obtained in our paper [12], for example, ex-
pression (7), agreed precisely with the results of landaus group.

within the rg approach these results can be obtained in just a few lines of argumentation.

to this end, the massless one-loop approximation

(1)
p t h(x; ) =  +

2
3

 + ...

,

 = ln x

of perturbation theory should be substituted into the right-hand side of the rst equation in
(6) to compute the generator (0, ) = () = 2/3, followed by an elementary integration
of the rst of eqs.(5).

moreover, starting from the two-loop expression (2)

p t h(x, ; ) containing the 2/42 term
we arrive at the second renormalization group approximation (8) performing summation of
the next-to-leading uv logs. comparing solution (8) with (7) one can conclude that two-
loop correction is extremely essential just in the vicinity of the ghost pole singularity at
x1 = exp (3/). this demonstrates that the rg method is a regular procedure, within
which it is quite easy to estimate the range of applicability of the results.

the second order renormgroup solution (8) for the invariant coupling rst obtained in [12]
contains the nontrivial logoflog dependence which is now widely known of the twoloop
approximation for the running coupling in quantum chromodynamics (qcd).

quite soon [13] this approach was formulated for the case of qft with two coupling
constants g and h, namely, for a model of pionnucleon interactions with self-interaction of
pions. to the system of functional equations for two invariant couplings

g2(cid:16)x, y; g2, h(cid:17) = g2(cid:18) x
h(cid:16)x, y; g2, h(cid:17) = h(cid:18) x

there corresponds a coupled system of nonlinear dierential equations. it was analysed [14]
in one-loop appriximation to carry out the uv analysis of the renormalizable model of pion-
nucleon interaction.

in refs. [6, 12, 13] and [14] the rg was thus directly connected with practical computa-
tions of the uv and ir asymptotics. since then this technique, known as the renormalization
group method (rgm), has become the sole means of asymptotic analysis in local qft.

1.5 other early rg applications

another important general theoretical application of the rg method was made in the summer
of 1955 in connection with the (then topical) so-called ghost pole problem. this eect, rst

7

discovered in quantum electrodynamics [8, 15], was at rst thought [15] to indicate a possible
diculty in qed, and then [9, 16] as a proof of the inconsistency of the whole local qft.

however, the rg analysis of the problem carried out in [10] on the basis of massless solu-
tion (2) demonstrated that no conclusion obtained with the aid of niteorder computations
within perturbation theory can be regarded as a complete proof. this corresponds precisely
to the impression, one can get when comparing (7) and (8). in the mid 50s this result was
very signicant, for it restored the reputation of local qft. nevertheless, in the course of the
following decade the applicability of qft in elementary particle physics remained doubtful
in the eyes of many theoreticians.

in the general case of arbitrary covariant gauge the renormalization group analysis in qed
was carried out in [17]. here, the point was that the charge renormalization is connected
only with the transverse part of the photon propagator. therefore, under nontransverse (for
example, feynman) gauge the dyson transformation has a more complex form. this issue has
been resolved by considering the treating the gauge parameter as another coupling constant.
ovsyannikov [18] found the general solution to the functional rg equations taking mass

into account:

(y, ) =  (y/x, (x, y; ))

in terms of an arbitrary function  of two arguments, reversible in its second argument.
to solve the equations, he used the dierential group equations represented as linear partial
dierential equations of the form (which are now widely known as the callansymanzik
equations):


x

(cid:26)x

+ y


y

 (y, )



(cid:27) (x, y, ) = 0 .

the results of this period of pioneers were collected in the chapter renormalization
group in the monograph [19], the rst edition of which appeared in 1957 (shortly after that
translated into english and french [20]) and very quickly acquired the status of the qft
folklore.

2 further bogoliubovs rg development

2.1 quantum eld theory

the next decade and a half brought a calm period, during which there was practically no
substantial progress in the renormgroup method.

1. new possibilities for applying the rg method were discovered when the technique of
operator expansion at small distances (on the light cone) appeared [21]. the idea of this
approach stems from the fact that the rg transform, regarded as a dyson transformation
of the renormalized vertex function, involves the simultaneous scaling of all its invariant
arguments (normally, the squares of the momenta) of this function. the expansion on the
light cone, so to say, separates the arguments, as a result of which it becomes possible to
study the physical uv asymptotic behaviour by means of the expansion coecients (when

8

some momenta are xed on the mass shell). as an important example we can mention the
evolution equations for moments of qcd structure functions [22].

2. in the early 70ies s. weinberg [23] proposed the notion of the running mass of a fermion.

if considered from the viewpoint of [17], this idea can be formulated as follows:

any parameter of the lagrangian can be treated as a (generalized) coupling constant, and

its eective counterpart should be included into the renorm-group formalism.

however, the results obtained in the framework of this approach turned out to be, practi-
cally, the same as before. for example, the most familiar expression for the fermion running
mass

m(x, ) = m(cid:18) 

(x, )(cid:19)

,

in which the leading uv logarithms are summed, was known for the electron mass in qed
(with  = 9/4) since the mid 50s (see [1], [12]).

3. the end of the calm period can be marked well enough by the year 1971, when the
renormalization group method was applied in the quantum theory of non-abelian gauge elds,
in which the famous eect of asymptotic freedom has been discovered [24].

the one-loop renorm-group expression

(1)

s (x; s) =

s

1 + s1 ln x

,

for the qcd eective coupling s exhibits a remarkable uv asymptotic behaviour thanks
to 1 being positive. this expression implies, in contrast to eq.(7), that the eective qcd
coupling decreases as x increases and tends to zero in the uv limit. this discovery, which
has become technically possible only because of the rg method use, is the most important
physical result obtained with the aid of the renormgroup approach in particle physics.

4. one more interesting application of the rg method in the multicoupling case, ascending
back in 50ies [14], refers to special solutions, so called separatrices in a phase space of several
invariant couplings. these solutions relate eective couplings and represent a scale invariant
trajectories, like, e.g., gi = gi(g1) in the phase space which are straight lines at the one-loop
case.

some of them, that are attractive (or stable) in the uv limit, are related to symme-
tries that reveal themselves in the high-energy domain. it has been conjectured that these
trajectories may be connected to hidden symmetries of a lagrangian and even could serve
as a tool to nd them. on this basis the method has been developed [25] for nding out
these symmetries. it was shown that in the phase space of the invariant charges the inter-
nal symmetry corresponds to a singular solution that remain straight-line when taking into
account the higher order corrections. such solutions corresponding to supersymmetry have
been found for some combinations of yukawa and quartic interactions.

generally, these singular solutions obey the relations

dgi
dt

=

dgi
dg1

dt

,

t = ln x

9

which are known since zimmermanns paper [26] as the reduction equations. in the 80ies they
have been used [27] (see also review paper [28] and references therein) in the uv analyzis of
asymptotically free models. just for these cases the one-loop reduction relations are adequate
to physics.

quite recently some other application of this technique has been found in a supersym-
metrical generalizations of grand unication scenario in the standard model. it has been
shown [29, 30, 31] that it is possible to achieve complete uv niteness of a theory if yukawa
couplings are related to the gauge ones in a way corresponding to these special solutions,that
is to reduction relations.

5. a general method of approximate solution of the massive rg equations has been
developed [32]. analytic expressions of high level of accuracy for an eective coupling and
one-argument function have been obtained up to four- and three-loop order [33]. for example,
the two-loop massive expression for the invariant coupling

s(q2, m2)rg,2 = s(1 + sa1(q2, m2) + s

a2(q2, m2)
a1(q2, m2)

ln(cid:16)1 + sa1(q2, m2)(cid:17))1

at small s values corresponds to adequate perturbation expansion

(9)

(10)

s(q2, m2)pert,2 = sn1  sa1(q2, m2) + 2
sa2

1(q2, m2)  2

s a2(q2, m2) + . . .o .

at the same time, it smoothly interpolates between two massless limits (with a   ln q2 +
c) at q2  m2 and q2  m2 described by equation analogous to eq.(8). in the latter case
it can be represented in the form usual for the qcd practice:

1

s (q2/2)rg,2  1(ln

q2

2 + b1 ln ln

q2

2!) ; b1 =

2
2
1

.

the solution (9) demonstrate, in particular, that the threshold crossing generally changes

the subtraction scheme [34].

our investigation [32, 33, 35] was prompted by the problem of explicitly taking into
account heavy quark masses in qcd. however, the results obtained are important from a
more general point of view for a discussion of the scheme dependence problem in qft. the
method used could also be of interest for rg applications in other elds within the situation
with disturbed homogeneity, such as, e.g., intermediate asymptotics in hydrodynamics, nite-
size scaling in critical phenomena and the excluded volume problem in polymer theory.

in the paper [35] this method was used for the eective couplings evolution in standard
model (sm). here, new analytic solution of a coupled system of three mass-dependent two-
loop rg evolution equations for three sm invariant gauge couplings has been obtained.

6. one more recent qft development relevant to renorm-group is the analytic approach
to perturbative qcd (pqcd). it is based upon the procedure of invariant analytization [36]
ascending to the end of 50ies.

the approach consists in a combining of two ideas: the rg summation of leading uv
logs with analyticity in the q2 variable, imposed by spectral representation of the kallen
lehmann type which implements general properties of local qft including the bogoliubov

10

condition of microscopic causality. this combination was rst devised [38] to get rid of the
ghost pole in qed about forty years ago.

here, the pqcd invariant coupling s(q2) is transformed into an analytic coupling
an(q2/2)  a(x), which, by constuction, is free of ghost singularities due to incorporating
some nonperturbative structures.

this analytic coupling a(x) has no unphysical singularities in the complex q2-plane; its
conventional perturbative expansion precisely coincides with the usual perturbation one for
s(q2) ; it has no extra parameters; it obeys an universal ir limiting value a(0) = 4/0
that is independent of the scale parameter ; it turns out to be remarkably stable with respect
to higher loop corrections and, in turn, to scheme dependence.

meanwhile, the analytized perturbation expansion [39] for an observable f , in contrast
with the usual case, may contain specic functions an(x), instead of powers (a(x))n .
in
other words, the pertubation series for f (x), due to analyticity imperative, may change its
form [40] turning into an asymptotic expansion `a la erdelyi over a nonpower set {an(x)} .

2.2 ways of the rg expanding

as is known, in the early 70ies wilson [41] succeeded in transplanting the rg philosophy
from relativistic qft to a quite another branch of modern theoretical physics, namely, the
theory of phase transitions in spin lattice systems. this new version of the rg was based on
kadanos idea[42] of joninig in blocks of few neighbouring spins with appropriate change
(renormalization) of the coupling constant.

to realize this idea, it is necessary to average spins in each block. this operation reducing
the number of degrees of freedom and simplifying the system under consideration, preserves
all its long-range properties under a suitable renormalization of the coupling constant. along
with this, the above procedure gives rise to a new theoretical model of the original physical
system.

in order that the system obtained by averaging be similar to the original one, one must
also discard those terms of a new eective hamiltonian which turns out to be irrelevant in the
description of infrared properties. as a result of this kadanowilson decimation, we arrive
at a new model system characterized by new values of the elementary scale (spacing between
blocks) and coupling constant (of blocks interaction). by iterating this operation, one can
construct a discrete ordered set of models. from the physical point of view the passage from
one model to some other one is an irreversible approximate procedure. two passages of that
sort applied in sequence should be equivalent to one, which gives rise to a group structure in
the set of transitions between models. however, in this case the rg is an approximative and
is realized as a semigroup.

this construction, obviously in no way connected with uv properties, was much clearer
from the general physical point of view and could therefore be readily understood by many
theoreticians. because of this, in the seventies the rg concept and its algorithmic structure
were successfully carried over to diverse branches of theoretical physics such as polymer
physics [43], the theory of noncoherent transfer [44], and so on.

apart from constructions analogous to that of kadanowilson, in a number of cases the
connection with the original quantum eld renormgroup was established. this has been done

11

with help of the functional integral representation. for example, the classic kolmogorovtype
turbulence problem was connected with the rg approach by the following steps [45]:

1. dene the generating functional for correlation functions.

2. write for this functional the path integral representation.

3. by a change of functional integration variable establish an equivalence of the given

classical statistical system with some qft model.

4. construct the schwingerdyson equations for this equivalent qft.

5. use the feynman diagram technique and perform a nite renormalization.

6. write down the standard rg equations and use them to nd xed point and scaling

behavior.

the physics of renormalization transformation in the turbulence problem is related to a change
of uv cuto in the wave-number variable.

hence, in dierent branches of physics the rg evolved in two directions:

 the construction of a set of models for the physical problem at hand by direct analogy
with the kadanowilson approach (by averaging over certain degrees of freedom) 
in polymer physics, noncoherent transfer theory, percolation theory, and others;

 the search for an exact rg symmetry directly or by proving its equivalence to some

qft: for example, in turbulence theory [45, 46] and turbulence in plasma [48].

what is the nature of the symmetry underlying the renormalization group?
a) in qft the renormgroup symmetry is an exact symmetry of a solution described in

terms of the notions of the equation(s) and some boundary condition(s).

b) in turbulence and some other branches of physics it is a symmetry of a solution of an

equivalent qft model.

c) in spin lattice theory, polymer theory, noncoherent transfer theory, percolation theory,
and so on (in which the kadanowilson blocking concept is used) the rg transformation
involves transitions inside a set of auxiliary models (constucted especially for this purpose).
to formulate rg, one should dene an ordered set m of models mi. the rg transforma-
tion connecting various models has the form r(n)mi = mni . here, the symmetry can be
formulated only in the terms of whole set m.

there is also a purely mathematical dierence between the aforesaid rg realizations. in
qft the rg is a continuous symmetry group. on the contrary, in the theory of critical
phenomena, polymers, and other cases (when an averaging operation is necessary) we have
an approximate discrete semigroup. it must be pointed out that in dynamical chaos theory, in
which rg ideas and terminology can sometimes be applied too, functional iterations do not
constitute a group at all, in general. an entirely dierent terminology is sometimes adopted
in the abovementioned domains of theoretical physics. terms like the realspace rg, the
wilson rg, the montecarlo rg, or the chaos rg are in use.

nevertheless, the armative answer to the question are there distinct renormalization
groups? implies no more than what has just been said about the dierences between cases
a) and b) on the one hand and c) on the other.

12

for this reason, we shall use notation of the bogoliubov renormalization group for the
exact lie group, as it emerged from the qft original papers [4, 6, 7] (see also chapter
renormalization group in the monograph [19, 20]) of mid-fties. this is to make clear
distinction between exact group and the wilson construction for which the term renormal-
ization group is widely used in the current literature.

2.3 functional selfsimilarity.

an attempt to analyse the relationship between these formulations on a simple common basis
was undertaken about fteen years ago [49]. in this paper (see also our surveys [50, 51, 52])
it was demonstrated that all the abovementioned realizations of the rg could be considered
in a unied manner by using only some common notions of mathematical physics.

in the general case it proves convenient to discuss the symmetry underlying the renorm
group with the aid of a continuous oneparameter transformation of two variables x and
g

rt :(cid:8)x  x = x/t, g  g = g(t, g)(cid:9) .

here, x is the basic variable subject to a scaling transformation, while g is a physical quantity
undergoing a more complicated functional transformation. to form a group, the transform
rt must satisfy the composition law

(11)

which yields the functional equation for g:

rtr = rt ,

g(x, g) = g (x/t, g(t, g)) .

(12)

this equation has the same form as the functional equation (4) for the eective coupling in
qft in the massless case, that is, at y = 0. it is therefore clear that the contents of rg
equation can be reduced to the group composition law.

in physical problems the second argument g of the transformation usually is related
to the boundary value of a solution of the problem under investigation. this means that
the symmetry underlying the rg approach is a symmetry of a solution (not of equation)
describing the physical system at hand, involving a transformation of the parameters entering
the boundary conditions.

therefore, in the simplest case the renormgroup can be dened as a continuous one
parameter group of transformations of a solution of a problem xed by a boundary condition.
the rg transformation aects the parameters of a boundary condition and corresponds to
changing the way in which this condition is introduced for one and the same solution.

special cases of such transformations have been known for a long time. if we assume that
f = g is a factored function of its arguments, then from eq.(12) it follows that f (z, f ) = f zk,
with k being a number. in this particular case the group transform takes the form

pt

: { z  z = z/t , f  f  = f tk } ,

which is known in mathematical physics long since as a power self-similarity transformation.
more general case rt with functional transformation law (11) can be characterized [49] as a
functional selfsimilarity (fss) transformation.

13

2.4 recent application in mathematical physics

we can now answer the question concerning the physical meaning of the symmetry that
underlies fss and the bogoliubov renormgroup. as we have already mentioned, it is not a
symmetry of the physical system or the equations of the problem at hand, but a symmetry of
a solution considered as a function of the essential physical variables and suitable boundary
conditions. a symmetry like that can be related, in particular, to the invariance of a physical
quantity described by this solution with respect to the way in which the boundary conditions
are imposed. the changing of this way constitutes a group operation in the sense that the
group property can be considered as the transitivity property of such changes.

homogeneity is an important feature of the physical systems under consideration. how-
ever, homogeneity can be violated in a discrete manner. imagine that such a discrete inhomo-
geneity is connected with a certain value of x , say, x = y. in this case the rg transformation
with canonical parameter t will have the form:

rt

: { x = x/t , y = y/t , g = g(t, y; g) } .

(13)

the group composition law yields precisely the functional equation (4).
the symmetry connected with fss is a very simple and frequently encountered property of
physical phenomena. it can easily be discovered in various problems of theoretical physics:
in classical mechanics, transfer theory, classical hydrodynamics, and so on [51, 52, 53, 54].

recently, some interesting attempts have been made to use the rg concept in classical
mathematical physics, in particular, to study strong nonlinear regimes and to investigate
asymptotic behavior of physical systems described by nonlinear partial dierential equations
(des).

about a decade ago the rg ideas were applied by late veniamin pustovalov with co-
authors [56] to analyze a problem of generating of higher harmonics in plasma. this problem,
after some simplication, was reduced to a couple of partial des with the boundary parameter
 solution characteristic  explicitly included. it was proved that these des admit an exact
symmetry group, that takes into account transformations of this boundary parameter, which
is related to the amplitude of the magnetic eld at a critical density point. the solution
symmetry obtained was then used to evaluate the eciency of harmonics generation in cold
and hot plasma. the advantageous use of the rg-approach in solving the above particular
problem gave promise that it may work in other cases and this was illustrated in [57] by a
series of examples for various boundary value problems.

moreover, in refs. [51, 57] the possibility of devising a regular method for nding a special
class of symmetries of the equations in mathematical physics, namely, rg-type symmetries,
was discussed. the latter are dened as solution symmetries with respect to transformations
involving parameters that enter into the solutions through the equations as well as through
the boundary conditions in addition to (or even rather than) the natural variables of the
problem present in the equations.

as it is well known, the aim of modern group analysis [58, 59], which goes back to works
of sophus lie [60], is to nd symmetries of des. this approach does not include a similar
problem of studying the symmetries of solutions of these equations. beside the main direction
of both the classical and modern analysis, there also remains the study of solution symmetries

14

with respect to transformations involving not only the variables present in the equations, but
also parameters entering into the solutions from boundary conditions.

from the aforesaid it is clear that the symmetries which attracted attention in the 50s
in connection with the discovery of the rg in qft were those involving the parameters of
the system in the group transformations. it is natural to refer to these symmetries related to
fss as the rg-type symmetries.

it should be noted that the procedure of revealing the rg symmetry (rgs), or some
group feature, similar to rg regularity, in any partial case (qft, spin lattice, polymers,
turbulence and so on) up to now is not a regular one. in practice, it needs some imagination
and atypical manipulation invented for every particular case  see discussion in [61]. by
this reason, the possibility to nd a regular approach to constructing rgs is of principal
interest.

recently a possible scheme of this kind was presented in application to mathematical
model of physical system that is described by des. the leading idea [54, 57, 62] in this case
is based on the fact that solution symmetry for such system can be found in a regular manner
by using the well-developed methods of modern group analysis. the scheme that describes
devising of rgs is then formulated [63] as follows.

firstly, a specic rg-manifold should be constructed. secondly, some auxiliary symmetry,
i.e., the most general symmetry group admitted by this manifold is to be found. thirdly, this
symmetry should be restricted on a particular solution to get the rgs. fourthly, the rgs
allows one to improve an approximate solution or, in some cases, to get an exact solution.

depending on both a mathematical model and boundary conditions, the rst step of
this procedure can be realized in dierent ways.
in some cases, the desired rg-manifold
is obtained by including parameters, entering into a solution via equation(s) and boundary
condition, in the list of independent variables. the extension of the space of variables in-
volved in group transformations, e.g., by taking into account the dependence of coordinates
of renormgroup operator upon dierential and/or non-local variables (which leads to the
lie-backlund and non-local transformation groups [59]) can also be used for constructing
the rg-manifold. the use of the ambartsumians invariant embedding method [64] and of
dierential constraints sometimes allows reformulations of a boundary condition in a form of
additional de(s) and enables one to construct the rg-manifold as a combination of original
equations and embedding equations (or dierential constraints) which are compatible with
these equations. at last, of particular interest is the perturbation method of constructing the
rg-manifold which is based on the presence of a small parameter.

the second step, the calculating of a most general group g admitted by the rg-manifold,
is a standard procedure in the group analysis and has been described in detail in many texts
and monographs  see, for example, [58, 65, 66].

the symmetry group g thus constructed can not as yet be referred to as a renormgroup.
in order to obtain this, the next, third step should be done which consists in restricting g
on a solution of a boundary value problem. this procedure utilizes the invariance condition
and mathematically appears as a combining of dierent coordinates of group generators
admitted by the rg-manifold.

the nal step, i.e., constructing analytic expression for solution of boundary value problem
on the basis of the rgs, usually presents no specic problems. a review of results, that were

15

obtained on the basis of the formulated scheme can be found, for example, in [63, 67, 68].

up to now the described regular method is feasible for systems that can be described
by des and is based on the formalism of modern group analysis. however, it seems also
possible to extend our approach on physical systems that are not described just by dierential
equations. a chance of such extension is based on recent advances in group analysis of systems
of integro-dierential equations [69, 70] that allow transformations of both dynamical variables
and functionals of a solution to be formulated [71]. more intriguing is the issue of a possibility
of constructing a regular approach for more complicated systems, in particular to that ones
having an innite number of degrees of freedom. the formers can be represented in a compact
form by functional (or path) integrals.

tion to dierent problems  see, e.g. j.casti, r.kalaba, imbedding methods in applied
mathematics (addison-wesley, reading, ma, 1973) and references therein.
