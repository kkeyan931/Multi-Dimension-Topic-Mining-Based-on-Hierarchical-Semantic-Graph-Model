(8) (9) (10) (11) (12) nd eqs.(4), (5) (6) bb ch transform gauge covariantly way u. applying covariant derivative eq.(8) summing lead eq.(9); hence, eq.(9) compatible eq.(8). vector eld necessary treat eq.(9) euler-lagrange equation derived l(k). applying covariant derivative eq.(9) summing yield constraints means eq.(8). 1the vector eld obeying transformation rule (6) also introduced yang- mills theory loop space , treated constrained nambu-goldstone eld loop space. 3 proceeding discuss non-abelian theory, let us consider abelian case g = u(1). lagrangian l(k) takes following form: la = + 4 f f + m2uu . 1 4 1 2 b(f 2u) (13) noted lagrangian la contain k. case, eq.(8) becomes simple equation (a u) = 0, locally solved u = 1 (14) scalar eld . substituting eq.(14) eq.(13), lagrangian dening abelian stuckelberg formalism: las = 1 4 f f + 1 2 (ma )(ma ) . (15) hand, eq.(10) becomes u = 1 6m h , (16) h b + b + b. substituting eq.(16) eq.(13) removing total derivative term, obtain lagrangian dening tmagt four dimensions : lta = 1 4 f f + 1 12 hh + 4 b f . (17) thus, using equation motion, la reduces las lta; lagrangians las lta classically equivalent. equivalence also established quantum level using path-integral method . equations (14) (16) give relation = 1 6 h , demonstrates duality b. tmagt therefore dual abelian stuckelberg formalism classical quantum levels. return non-abelian theory. apart trace generators ta, lagrangian la quadratic part l(k). see l(k) describes massive yang-mills eld (bare) mass m. let us rst consider case k = 0. case, right-hand side eq.(10) include u , makes possible eliminate u lagrangian l(0), given eq.(1) k = 0, get polynomial lagrangian containing u . substituting u = 1 6m ch l(0) removing total derivative 4 term, obtain lt = + tr(f f ) + 1 12 tr(b f) . 1 4 4 tr(chch ) (18) also obtained, quantum mechanically, carrying gaussian integration u vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude based l(0). hence, l(0) equivalent lt classical quantum levels. massive yang-mills theory dened lagrangian lt, call topologically mas- sive yang-mills theory (tmymt), presented lahiri barcelos- neto, cabo silva  non-abelian version tmagt discussed . quantization tmymt recently studied lahiri hwang lee . characteristic lt includes polynomial kinetic term b. would like emphasize unlike abelian case, vector eld essential tmymt maintain non-abelian gauge symmetry. next consider case k = 1. lagrangian l(1), given eq.(1) k = 1, written lft = + 1 4 1 2 tr(f f ) + m2tr(uu ) , 4 tr( eb f) eb b iq ( ) , f eld strength v u : f v v + iq . (19) (20) (21) notice second third terms l(1) simply expressed tensor eld eb; vector eld hides eb, occur lft explicitly. massive yang-mills theory dened lagrangian lft presented freedman townsend , called freedman- townsend model. quantization freedman-townsend model studied thierry-mieg baulieu systematic manner . eqs.(4) (7), gauge transformation rules eb v found eb = + iq , v = , + iq . 5 (22) (23) (24) clearly, lft gauge-invariant total derivative term. euler-lagrange equation eb f = 0 , (25) agrees eq.(8) k = 1. case k = 1, eq.(9) reduces commutator eq.(8) u summation , hence independent equation motion. reason, necessary take account eq.(9) k = 1; vector eld essential freedman- townsend model. u eliminated lft repeatedly using eq.(10) k = 1, lft turns lagrangian including nonpolynomial kinetic term b. shows dierence tmymt freedman- townsend model. equation (25) locally solved v1v terms v( g) represented v = exp(cid:16) iq v = 1 iq (26) pa ata(cid:17) scalar elds a. substitution eq.(26) eq.(19), lagrangian dening non-abelian stuckelberg formalism : ls = 1 4 tr(f f ) + 1 2 m2tr(eu eu ) , (27) eu 1 iq v1v. freedman-townsend model therefore classi- cally equivalent non-abelian stuckelberg formalism . since tmymt classically dierent freedman-townsend model, tmymt considered, least classically, dual theory non-abelian stuckelberg formalism.  classically dual theory non-abelian stuckelberg formalism described non- polynomial lagrangian obtained eliminating u lft repeatedly using eq.(10) k = 1 expressed u = 1 2m eb . (28) nonpolynomial lagrangian thus written terms eb. duality ( ata) eb guaranteed relation eu = 2m ( eb + ) whose right-hand side power series determined eq.(28) iteration respect u. 1 equivalence dierence massive yang-mills theories characterized lt, lft, ls discussed classical level aid equations motion. general, classical equivalence two 6 theories imply equivalence quantum level , vice versa . since lagrangians lt, lft, ls involve interaction terms, is, terms disappearing abelian limit, means clear whether equivalence dierence discussed persist quantum level. study needed understand quantum-mechanical equivalence dierence massive yang-mills theories. lagrangian l(k) collectively dene various four-dimensional massive yang-mills theories distinguished constant k. among them, tmymt freedman-townsend model, correspond cases k = 0 k = 1 respectively, considered particular theories. would like emphasize paper besides known theories, exist new massive yang- mills theories obtained choosing k real numbers 0 1. noted new theories need vector elds u: u necessary l(k) gauge invariant total derivative terms polynomial, respectively. since l(k) describes various four-dimensional massive yang-mills theories without higgs bosons, may call l(k) universal lagrangian massive yang-mills theories without higgs bosons. abelian limit, l(k) becomes independent k; is, massive yang-mills theories dened l(k) abelian limit. apart trace gen- erators ta, limit regarded tmagt equivalence la lta. non-abelian generalizations tmagt also studied terms antield-brst method without introducing extra elds u . study concludes possible generalize lta incorporate power-counting renormalizable interaction terms consisting b. obviously non-abelian generalizations dened l(k) lie outside scope proof ref.. needless say, important investigate renormalizability unitarity massive yang-mills theories dened l(k). beginning in- vestigation, we, however, face diculty once: vector eld kinetic term l(k), and, abelian limit, disappears l(k). conse- quently, ordinary perturbative procedures used investigate renormalizability theories. addition, proof unitarity based kugo-ojima quartet mechanism  applied theories. point consider rst therefore treat within framework perturbation theory. freedman-townsend model, problem disappearing avoided treating eb fundamental eld. unitarity freedman- townsend model shown terms kugo-ojima quartet mecha- nism, renormalizability model still open question; means obvious whether perturbatively nonrenormalizable structure non-abelian stuckelberg formalism four dimensions  persists freedman-townsend model, equivalence clear quan- 7 tum level. thus, renormalizability freedman-townsend model also studied future. acknowledgements grateful professor s. naka members theoretical physics group nihon university encouragements useful com- ments. work supported part nihon university research grant. 8
