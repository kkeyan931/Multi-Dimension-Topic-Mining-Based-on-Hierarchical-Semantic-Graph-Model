we show that the brst charge for the n=2 superstring system can be written as q =
2i b+)er, where b and  are super-reparametrizations ghosts. this provides

er(h dz

a trivial proof of the nilpotence of this operator.

1. introduction

superstring theory can be seen as a critical n = 1 superconformal system dened on

the world-sheet. it can be quantized by studying the cohomology of the nilpotent brst

operator

q = i dz

2i

[c(t + 1

2 t g) + (g + 1

2 gg)],

(1.1)

where the matter generators t and g satisfy the n = 1 superconformal algebra with central
charge c = 15, and the ghosts generators t g and gg satisfy the corresponding algebra with

central charge c = 15. in such a way, the ghost sector allows to x the gauge symmetry

of the theory. the ghosts generators are constructed out of a pair of fermionic elds b, c

(with spins 2 and 1, respectively) that x the conformal symmetry, and a pair of bosonic

elds ,  (with spins 3/2 and 1/2, respectively) that x the world-sheet supersymmetry.

physical states are described by vertex operators living in the cohomology of the

brst operator (1.1). in order to include spacetime spinors in the spectrum, we need to

fermionize the bosonic ghosts as

 = e,

 = e,

(1.2)

where  and  are free fermions of spins 1 and 0 respectively, and  is a chiral boson [1].

note that this fermionization does not involve the zero mode of , then physical states are

independent of this mode (it is due to the fact that physical states are constructed out

of  and not out of , for example). the space of the physical states is called small

hilbert space and the whole space, involving operators constructed out of  zero mode,

is called large hilbert space. we can dene the space of physical states as the set of

operators that commute with h . then, physical vertex operators not only must belong
to the cohomology of q but also must commute with h . as consistency, q not only must
be nilpotent but also must anticommute with h  [2].

a similar analysis can be carried out for the string with n=2 world-sheet superconfor-

mal symmetry [3]. physical states belong to the cohomology of the n=2 brst operator

q = i dz

2i

[c(t + 1

2 t g) + +(g + 1

2 gg

) + +(g+ + 1

2 gg

+) + c(j + 1

2 j g)],

(1.3)

where the matter generators t , j and g satisfy the n=2 superconformal algebra with
central charge c = 6 and the ghosts generators t g, j g and gg
algebra with central charge c = 6. the critical system can be represented by a pair of

 satisfy the corresponding

1

complex chiral superelds xi(z, z, +, ) and xi(z, z, +, ) (i = 1, 2), being the sig-
nature of the background space (2, 2) or euclidean, but not minkowskian. this theory

describes self-dual systems in four dimensions (for related issues see [4]). the ghosts gen-

erators are constructed out of a pair of fermionic ghosts b, c (with spins 2, 1, respectively)
that x conformal symmetry, and another pair of fermionic ghosts b, c (with spins 1 and 0,
respectively) that x the u (1) gauge symmetry generated by j, and four bosonic ghosts 

and  (with spins 3/2 and 1/2, respectively) that x the world-sheet supersymmetries.

we need to fermionize the bosonic ghosts in order to describe spacetime spinors, the

pair + and  becomes

+ = +e+,

 = +e+,

(1.4)

where + and + (spins 0 and 1, respectively) are free fermions, and + is a chiral boson.

for the bosonic pair  and + there is an equivalent expression involving ,  and 

instead +, + and +. note that, as in the n=1 case, the zero modes of the ghosts  are

not involved in the fermionizations, then physical states are independent of such modes.

we can dene the space of physical states as the set of vertex operators that commute

with h + and h . this will be the analogous of the small hilbert space of the n=1

case, the large hilbert space takes into account operators that depend on zero modes of

. as consistency, the brst operator must be not only nilpotent but also anticommute

with h .

it was shown in [5] that the n=1 superstring brst operator can be written as

q = er(i dz

2i

b 2)er,

(1.5)

which trivially proves the nilpotence of the brst operator. this also shows that the
2i b 2 are equals. the last one is trivial in the large hilbert

cohomologies of q and h dz

space, then q is trivial in this space. in the small q is not trivial as expected.

the purpose of this paper is to extend the result (1.5) for the n=2 superstring.

2. similarity transformation for the n=2 superstring

the brst current jbrst (z) is given by q = h dz

2ijbrst (z). after fermionize the
bosonic ghosts as in (1.4) and then bosonize  = e and  = e , the brst current
becomes [3]

jbrst = ct + e++g + e g+ + cj + bcc  cbc
b[e++ (e )  e (e++ )]  2bee++

the brst current has a total derivative term that we have no written in (2.1) .

we will show that

where the u (1) current is bosonized as j  h. using (2.2), jbrst is trivially nilpotent
since j0 has no poles with itself.

to prove (2.2) we use the expansion

where, for r = h dz

the term for n = 5 in the expansion vanishes identically since the ope between j4 and r

has no single poles. then, the terms of higher order in the expansion (2.4) vanish too.

it is straightforward to check that the brst current is equal to j0+j1+ 1

2! j2+ 1

4! j4

up to total derivatives.

3. concluding remarks

the form that we have written the brst current (2.2), proves its nilpotence trivially.

note that the cohomology of h j0 is trivial in the large hilbert space, then the n=2

cohomology is trivial in that space. however, such a property is not hold in the small

hilbert space since the n=2 has non-trivial states [4].

one could be tempted to use the expansion (2.4) as brst current for the non-critical

case. however, if the central charge c is dierent of the critical value 6, in the expansion

would appear one term proportional to (6 c)h dzcc 2ce+++e+ which does not
commute with h dz = h dze . therefore, the expansion (2.4) can be used as brst

charge in the critical case only.
