(1) inner product ( , ) dened below. gauge eld g use matrix notation (summation repeated indices), g(a) g (a)ta = a(x) a(x) ig, (2) quantities ta matrices convenient representation lie algebra gauge group g, quantities gauge potential components,  = c ab tc, a(x) = ta. (3) (4) assumed gauge group g semisimple compact. inner product ( , ) two lie algebra valued (matrix valued) quantities = aata b = bata expressed aid lie algebra structure constants f c ab follows, (a, b) = habaabb, hab = f c ab f b bc . (5) (6) quantity hab inverse hab used lower rise lie algebra indices, respectively. notation used otherwise pretty standard self-explanatory, e.g. greek letters used indices denoting minkowski space indices ranging 0 3, latin indices middle alphabet (k, , ...) denoting space indices ranging 1 3. minkowski space metric taken diagonal, signature (+, , , ). unless otherwise stated, repeated indices always summed over, lie algebra-, spacetime- space indices. 1 convenient future reference write action (1) terms lagrangian l. action integral lagrangian l appropriate time interval . thus, f = z x0 x0 dx0l, l = (7) (8) 1 2 zv d3x(cid:16)g0k(a), g0k(a)(cid:17) 1 4 zv d3x(cid:16)gk(a), gk(a)(cid:17) . expression (8) lagrangian l, quantity v appropriate domain r3, yet specied. well known, requiring action (1) stationary respect local variations potential components a, considered independent quantities, yields follwing eld equations, covariant gradient (a) used eq. (9) convenient notion, (a)g(a) = 0 , = 0, 1, 2, 3. frequently used follows. (a) + ig , (9) (10) non-abelian gauss law obtained equations (9) = 0. expressed terms potential non-abelian gauss law reads follows, k(a)k(a)a0 k(a) ak = 0, ak(x) 0ak(x). (11) (12) time derivative quantity frequently follows denoted dot top quantity, equation (12) above. 1.1 hamiltonian weyl gauge formalism well known  yang-mills theory expressed canonical form hamil- tonian gauge, so-called weyl gauge  a0 = 0. yang-mills lagrangian case a0 = 0, called lw here, obtained expression (8) putting a0 = 0 expression, lw = 1 2 z d3x( ak, ak) 1 4 z d3x(gk, gk). (13) lagrangian (13) describes theory quite yang-mills theory, since gauss law absent eld equations following action principle 2 expression (13) lagrangian. gauss law takes following form case a0 = 0, seen eq. (11) above, k(a) ak = 0. (14) usual way analyse yang-mills theory weyl gauge a0 = 0, proceed lagrangian (13), disregarding gauss law begin with. using variables aa k generalised coordinates velocities, respectively, perfectly simple derive canon- ical hamiltonian formalism system dened lagrangian (13). corresponding hamiltonian hw is, k aa hw = 1 2 z d3x(k, k) + 1 4 z d3x(gk, gk), (15) i.e. simple sum kinetic term, depending canonical momenta k interaction term, depending conjugate canonical coordinates aa k only. only, potential, 2 first attempt canonical formulation gauss law force gauss law, eq. (11) above, considered equation determining (matrix valued) potential component a0, given space components a. equation system linear, elliptic partial dierential equations time x0 acting parameter appropriate interval, x v independet variables. discuss solvability eq. (11) subsequently, proceed assuming existence unique solution a0, functional space components time derivatives 0a a, i.e. a0 = a0na, ao . (16) question whether yang-mills system, originally dened action (1), permits canonical structure potential component a0 solution gauss law (11), i.e. a0 given terms expression (16). possible get insight question without specifying actual functional form relation (16) minute detail. lagrangian yang-mills system, potential component a0, given relation (16) above, obtained simply inserting solution (16) a0 lagrangian (8) above. resulting lagrangian called l0, explicitly given follows, l0 = 1 2 zv 4 zv 1 d3x(cid:16)k(a)a0na, ao ak, k(a)a0na, ao ak(cid:17) d3x(cid:16)gkl(a), gkl(a)(cid:17) . (17) point appropriate check whether action principle involving lagrangian l0 (17) reproduces eld equations (9). perfectly straightforward verify 3 following result, f z x0 x0 f dx0l0 = z x0 z x0 x0 x0 f dx0zv dx0zv d3x(cid:16)ak, 0(a)(k(a)a0na, ao ak) gk(a)(cid:17) (18) d2k(cid:16)a0na, ao , k(a)a0na, ao ak(cid:17) . boundary conditions solution a0 gauss law, i.e. system linear elliptic partial dierential equations (11), enter discussion. surface term eq. (18) non-vanishing, variation surface functional, lagrangian (17) valid lagrangian action principle supposed lead eld equations (9) = 1, 2, 3, a0 given (16). rst place domain v actually considered r3. integrals v given following interpretation, zv d3x = lim rz|x|<r d3x vanishing surface term eq. (18) equivalent follwing, lim rz|x|=r dr2(cid:16)a0, (r)(a)a0na, ao a(r)(cid:17) = 0, superscript (r) denotes radial component corresponding quantity. (19) (20) thus, surface term (20) vanishes admissible variations independent generalised coordinates velocities a, respectively, variational principle leads following equations motion, f z x0 x0 dx0l0 = 0, 0(a)(k(a)a0na, ao ak) gk(a) = 0, (21) (22) evident relation (18). needless say, equations (22) nothing eld equations (9) = 1, 2, 3, a0 given formal solution (16) gauss law (11). vanishing surface term (20) depends assumed asymptotic behaviour independent variables a, well boundary conditions (at spatial innity) dependent variable a0. return question below, continue time assuming relation (20) valid. lagrangian l0 given (17) ought suitable starting point construction hamiltonian corresponding canonical variables means legendre transform usual way. formal denition canonical momentum p k conjugate coordinate ak is, k (x0, x) p l0 a(x0, x) ak = (cid:16)k(a)a0na, ao(cid:17)a (x0, x) aa k(x0, x), (23) 4 condition (20) used calculation functional derivative l0 (23) above. (23) satises gauss law (11), one nds immediately (23) view fact a0 eq. k(a)pk(x0, x) 0. (24) one supposed able solve eq. (23) generalised velocity aa k terms p, respectively. impossible, since, eq. (23) solved quantity dened below, (x0, x) k(a) ak(x0, x), (25) i.e. one tries derive equation quantity dened eq. (23), one gets completely vacuous identity quantity, result eq. (24). would seem then, canonical formalism breaks case hand. however necessarily case. diculty described avoided one manage make a0 independent generalized velocity variables a. accomplished present situation (a0 6= 0) imposing following gauge condition, k(a) ak(x0, x) = 0. (26) condition (26) generalized coulomb gauge condition referred previously. fact actually proper gauge condition, demonstrated ref. . however, one uses gauge condition (26) generalised velocities ak longer independent quantities, one cannot use formula (23) stands construction canonical momentum variables. alternative procedure leads proper canonical formalism given below. 3 gauss law asymptotic conditions assume generalized coulomb gauge condition (26 force. gauss law, eq. (11), takes following form, k(a)k(a)a0 = 0. (27) one demands solution eq. (27) vanishes roughlty speaking faster | x | 1 2 | x | , solution vanishes identically. seen follows. take inner product eq. (27) a0 integrate x. using ordinary divergence theorem one readily obtains following result, lim r z|x|<r d3x(k(a)a0, k(a)a0) = lim r z|x|=r dr2(a0, (r)(a)a0). (28) assuming a0(x0, x) ||x|=r r , (r)(a)a0(x0, x) ||x|=r r1 , > 1 2 , (29) 5 one nds limiting value right hand side eq. (28) zero. since inner product ( , ) positive denite, one concludes eq. (28) a0 covariantly constant. however, since a0 vanishes innity assumption, covariant constant zero, i.e. a0(x0, x) 0. (30) needless say, asymptotic condition (29) somewhat rened; needed obtain result (30) right hand side eq. (28) vanishes, guarantees a0 covariantly constant, a0 limiting value 0 innity (or nite point), covariant constant question actually vanishes. however, class functions (roughly speaking) asymptotic behaviour (29) exhaust class possible solutions eq. (27). also possible consider functions a0 approach non-vanishing constant matrix space innity, lim |x| a0(x0, x) = ata, (31) real quantities absolute constants. addition eq. (31) one impose asymptotic condition radial derivative a0, lim |x| | x | | x | a0(x0, x) = 0. (32) requiring validity asymptotic conditions (31) (32) using standard arguments potential theory , one derives integral representation function a0 involving (ordinary) laplacian function, a0(x0, x) = 1 4 zr3 d3y 1 | x | 2 ya0(x0, y), (33) using present form gauss law, eq. (27), one converts (33) integral equation determination a0. purpose convenient introduce new notation, u ka b(x0, y) := 2gf bcakc(x0, y), v b(x0, y) := 2gf bc yk akc(x0, y) + g2f cdf c baa k (x0, y)aka (x0, y). one obtains following integral equations, (34) (35) aa 0(x0, x) = 1 4 zr3 d3y 1 | x | (u ka b(x0, y) ab 0(x0, y) yk + v b(x0, y)ab 0(x0, y)) . (36) integral equations (36) constitute starting point proof existence solutions present form gauss law, eq. (27). one needs naturally also specify conditions potential components aa k, which, together space derivatives determine (unique) solution eq. (36). part heavy mechinery mentioned 6 introduction, omit paper. however appropriate note following asymptotic conditions, needed existence solutions aa 0 eq. (36), aa k(x0, x) 1 | x |1+ , x aa k(x0, x) 1 | x |2+ , > 0. (37) denote solution system integral equations (36) a0 {a}, corresponding lagrangian l00 (compare eq. (17)) , l00 = 1 2 zv 4 zv 1 d3x(cid:16)k(a)a0 {a} ak, k(a)a0 {a} ak(cid:17) d3x(cid:16)gkl(a), gkl(a)(cid:17) . (38) lagrangian (38) next section used derive hamiltonian yang-mills system condition generalized coulomb gauge (26) force. implement condition constraint, means (matrix valued) lagrange multiplier eld c(x), used modify lagrangian (38) follows, l00 l = l00 +zv d3x(c(x), k(a) ak). (39) 4 canonical coordinates, momenta hamiltonian make direct transition hamiltonian formulation using modied lagrangian (39) above, manner described general case berezin . starting point familiar denition canonical momentum variables k, k(x0, x) l a(x0, x) ak = (k(a)a0 {a})a aa k (k(a)c)a , (40) equations (40) above, together constraint equations (26) supposed solved quantities aa momenta k, respectively. using eqns. (26) (27), one nds immediately eq. (40) k c terms canonical coordinates ak k(a)k(a)c = k(a)k, (41) which, together appropriate boundary conditions, denes quantity c x-dependent functional , respectively, c = c {a, } (x0, x). (42) certainly desirable solution c {a, } eq. (41) unique. uniqueness guaranteed one uses following boundary condition, lim r z|x|=r dr2(c(x), (r)(a)c(x)) = 0. (43) 7 proof uniqueness solution eq. (41) condition (43) essentially already given connection eq. (27). namely, two distinct solutions eq. (41), dierence satises corresponding homogeneous equation, precisely form (27). however, condition (43), homogeneous equation question trivial zero solution, demonstrated discussion following eq. (27). hence solution c {a, } unique. one straightforwardly expresses generalised velocity terms coordinate- momentum variables, aa k = (k(a0 {a} c))a k . (44) construction hamiltonian h proceeds usual way. relation dening hamiltonian h following, h = zv d3x(k, ak) l00, (45) quantity ak ocurring expressions (45) given terms canonical variables expression (44). observed, indeed lagrangian l00 enters denition hamiltonian h above, since stage constraint (26) identity. straightforward calculation one nally obtains hamiltonian expressed terms canonical variables denition (45), h = 1 1 2 zv +zv 4 zv d3x(cid:16)k, k(cid:17) + d3x(cid:16)k, k(a)a0 {a}(cid:17) + d3x(cid:16)gkl(a), gkl(a)(cid:17) 1 2 zv d3x(cid:16)k(a)c, k(a)c(cid:17) , (46) quantity c appropriate solution system linear elliptic partial dier- ential equations (41), discussed previously. 5 hamiltonian equations motion hamiltonian equations motion obtained functional dierentiation hamil- tonian (46) respect canonical momenta coordinates, respectively. equations motion coordinates follows, aa k(x0, x) h a(x0, x) k = (k(a)(a0 {a} c))a k, (47) agree precisely expressions (44) should. calculation leading eq. (47) one encounters following surface term, lim rz|x|<r d3xk(c, k(a)c) = lim rz dr2(c, (r)(a)c), (48) 8 must vanish order functional derivative eq. (47) well dened. surface term (48) question vanishes should, view general boundary conditions (43) imposed quantity c {a, }. calculation functional derivative hamiltonian (46) respect generalized coordinate variables aa k fairly lengthy, nevertheless straightforward. course calculation one nds surface term analoguous eq. (20) vanish order functional derivative question well dened, i.e. lim rz|x|=r dr2(cid:16)a0, (r)(a)a0 {a} a(r)(cid:17) = 0. (49) condition (49) quite non-trivial. remembered, variation quantity a0 declared vanish outside nite region, since a0 dependent variable, determined gauss law, i.e. present case eq. (36). essentially conditions (37) > 0, able prove, iterative solution eqns. (36), equivalent system partial dierential equations (27) boundary conditions (31) (32), that, large | x |, a0(a)(x0, x) = 1 | x |! , (50) local variations a. one assumes > 1 discussion above, essentially trivial show conclusively eq. (50) valid. however, proceed assuming eq. (50) valid also one merely takes > 0, plausible assumption discussed above. conditions (37) (50) valid, precisely condition (49) force, one obtains, a(x0, x) k h k(x0, x) aa = iga (51) +(cid:16)gk(a)(cid:17)a iga. pairs equations, (47) (51) supposed equivalent original eld equations (9). analyse equivalence below. purpose convenient note equations (47) (51) admit constant motion, 0(k(a)k) = 0, (52) crucial establishing equivalence eqns. (9) hamiltonian equations motion (47) (51). recalling equation (41) dening quantity c together boundary conditions (43), one nds using eq. (52) k(a)k(a)c = k1, (53) k1 denotes constant. 9 so, equations motion canonical variables , respectively, force, quantity c determined equation (53), constant k1 far unknown. eliminating canonical momentum variables equations (47) (51) one obtains following equations, (a)gk(a) + k(a) c + 2igh ak, ci = 0 , k = 1, 2, 3. point one recall gauss law force construction, k(a)g0k(a) = 0. (54) (55) terms involving quantity c eqns. (54) one could conclude hamiltonian equations motion (47) (51) equivalent original eld equations (9). order obtain required equivalence one must demand k(a) c + 2igh ak, ci = 0, (56) simultaneously hamiltonian equations motion. situation quantity c determined partial dierential equations (53). however, appear possible prove unique solution (53) also satises (56) constant k1 arbitrary value, dierent zero. however substituting value eq. (53) one obtains nal equation determining quantity c, equations motion force, k1 = 0, (57) k(a)k(a)c = 0. (58) eq. (58) trivial solution c = 0 class functions satisfying boundary conditions (43) discussed previously. hence constant integration k1 eq. (53) equals zero, eq. (56) trivially true, whence hamiltonian equations (47) (51) completely equivalent original eld equations (9). thus demanding condition (57) valid, one obtains complete equivalence original eld equations (9) hamiltonian equations motion (47) (51) obtained using generalized coulomb gauge condition (26). appropriate return hamiltonian (46). hamiltonian diers non- trivial way hamiltonian weyl gauge, i.e. expression (15), mainly due c -dependent terms former expression, also due fact non-trivial a0-dependence possible case hamiltonian (46). fact functional c {a, } actually becomes zero equations motion force, mean one set c equal zero hamiltonian (46) use resulting expression generate appropriate equations motion means functional dierentiation. functional dependence quantity c {a, } hamiltonian (46) essential order generate proper equations motion. 10 finally comment briey possibilities generalize considerations paper situation one couples yang-mills eld e.g. fermionic eld. eld equations (9) get replaced following, (a)g(a) = j g tat a, (59) one add eld equations fermionic elds. also case possible use generalized coulomb gauge condition (26) gauss law takes form k(a)k(a)a0 = j0.
