abstract

we extend the usual world-volume action for a dp-brane to the case of n coincident dp-
branes where the world-volume theory involves a u(n) gauge theory. the guiding principle in
our construction is that the action should be consistent with the familiar rules of t-duality.
the resulting action involves a variety of potential terms, i.e., nonderivative interactions, for
the nonabelian scalar elds. this action also shows that dp-branes naturally couple to rr
potentials of all form degrees, including both larger and smaller than p+1. we consider the
dynamics resulting from this action for dp-branes moving in nontrivial background elds, and
illustrate how the dp-branes are polarized by external elds. in a simple example, we show
that a system of d0-branes in an external rr four-form eld expands into a noncommutative
two-sphere, which is interpreted as the formation of a spherical d2-d0 bound state.

1 introduction

our understanding of string theory has been transformed since 1995 [1]. one important aspect
in this transformation was the appreciation of the important role of extended objects beyond
strings in these theories. of particular interest for the type ii (and i) superstring theories are
the dirichlet-branes (d-branes) which can be regarded as stringy solitons which carry ramond-
ramond (rr) charges [2]  see also [3].

these objects arise in considering t-duality transformations of a ten-dimensional type i
superstring theory [4, 5, 6]. so as originally conceived, a dp-brane is a (p + 1)-dimensional
extended surface in spacetime which supports the endpoints of open strings. the massless
modes of this open string theory form a supersymmetric u(1) gauge theory with a vector aa,
9  p real scalars i and their superpartner fermions. at leading order, the low-energy action
corresponds to the dimensional reduction of that for ten-dimensional u(1) super-yang-mills
theory. as usual in string theory, there are higher order  = 2
s corrections, where s is the
string length scale. following the work of ref. [7], leigh showed that the action incorporating
these corrections to all orders in the eld strength takes the born-infeld form [8]

sbi = tpz dp+1 (cid:18)eqdet(p [g + b]ab + 22

s fab)(cid:19)

(1)

where tp is the brane tension. the higher order corrections in this action can be trusted as
long as derivatives of the gauge eld strength (and second derivatives of the scalars) are small
on the string scale s. leighs action (1) also reveals that the d-branes are dynamical objects,
whose transverse displacements1 are described by i, i.e., x i() = 22
si. this dynamics is
implicit in the pull-back of the bulk spacetime tensors to the d-brane world-volume, which is
denoted by the symbol p [. . .], e.g.,

p [g]ab = gab + 42

s gi(a b)i + 424

s gijaibj .

(2)

eq. (1) incorporates the couplings of the world-volume vector and scalars to the massless neveu-
schwarz elds of the bulk closed string theory, i.e., the metric, dilaton and kalb-ramond eld.
since a d-brane also carries an rr charge [2], there must be couplings to the massless rr
states of the closed string. these interactions are incorporated in a chern-simons action of the
form[9, 10]

scs = pz phx c (n) ebi e22

s f

(3)

where c (n) denote the (n+1)-form rr potentials and p is the rr charge of the brane. thus a
dp-brane is naturally charged under the (p+1)-form rr potential. however in the presence of
background kalb-ramond elds or world-volume gauge elds, it may also carry a charge of the
rr potentials with a lower form degree, as allowed with the couplings induced by the exponen-
tial factor[9]. such congurations have an interpretation in terms of bound states of d-branes
of dierent dimensions[11]. more exotic gauge eld congurations also have interesting inter-
pretations in terms of intersecting branes[12]. note that in general the background spacetime
elds are functions of the transverse coordinates, and so in the above actions (1) and (3), they
become functionals of the scalars i. hence, even in the leading low energy approximation,
these scalars would be governed by a non-linear sigma model action.

1here and in the following equation, we have chosen static gauge  see section 2.

1

one of the most remarkable properties of d-branes is that the u(1) gauge symmetry of
an individual d-brane is enhanced to a nonabelian u(n) symmetry for n coincident d-branes
[11]. as n parallel d-branes approach each other, the ground state modes of strings stretching
between the d-branes become massless. these extra massless states carry the appropriate
charges to then ll out u(n) representations and the u(1)n of the individual d-branes is
enhanced to u(n). hence aa becomes a nonabelian gauge eld and the scalars i become
scalars in the adjoint representation of u(n). understanding how to accommodate this simple
yet remarkable modication in the world-volume actions for general backgrounds has only
received limited attention[13, 14].

the naive extension of the chern-simons action (3) is apparently straightforward. one
would include an additional trace over gauge indices of the nonabelian eld strength which now
appears in the exponential factor. however, douglas[13] has proposed that the background
elds should be functionals of the non-abelian scalars (rather than, e.g., only the u(1) or
center-of-mass component of i). further it was pointed out [15] that the pull-backs of the bulk
spacetime tensors should be dened in terms of covariant derivatives of the full nonabelian scalar
elds. that is, ai  dai in eq. (2). both of these suggestions were conrmed to leading
order by examining string scattering amplitudes [16, 17]. hence it would seem that extending
the chern-simons action to accomodate the nonabelian world-volume theory involves simply
introducing a gauge trace which encompasses all of the elds (and the pull-back) appearing in
eq. (3). however, in the following section, we will argue that the resulting action is incomplete
as it is not consistent with t-duality. extending the action to one consistent with t-duality
will involve introducing extra terms involving commutators of the nonabelian scalars. this
construction reveals that dp-branes also have natural couplings to the rr potentials with form
degree larger than p+1.

we also use t-duality to build a consistent nonabelian extension of the born-infeld action
(1). our starting point is the d9-brane action which contains no scalars, and we simply apply
a t-duality transformation on 9  p directions to produce that for a dp-brane. the latter
also generates new terms involving commutators of the nonabelian scalars. in incorporating
the u(n) gauge symmetry here, we also include a single gauge trace2 encompassing not only
the explicit gauge elds and commutators, but also on the implicit nonabelian scalars in the
functional dependence and pull-backs of the background elds [13, 15]. the appearance of
the latter can again be conrmed for the born-infeld part of the action by examining string
scattering amplitudes [16, 17].

an outline of the paper is as follows: we begin in section 2 by establishing our conven-
tions and also recalling the t-duality transformations of both the spacetime and world-volume
elds. we argue here that introducing a single gauge trace and substituting nonabelian elds
everywhere in eqs. (1) and (3) yields an incomplete action. in section 3, we apply t-duality to
construct a consistent nonabelian extension of the born-infeld action. in section 4, we present
a similar construction for the chern-simons part of the action. in section 5, we discuss some
consistency checks for the resulting actions. in particular, we compare the linear interactions
of closed string elds to the nonabelian d0-brane action with the interactions derived for this
case from matrix theory [20]. in section 6, we begin an investigation of the dynamics resulting
from our action for dp-branes moving in a nontrivial background elds, and discuss how the

2of course, there is some ambiguity as to the precise ordering of quantities inside this trace [18, 19], and we

are only partially able to resolve this question below.

dp-branes can be polarized by external elds. in a simple example, we show that a system
of d0-branes in an external rr four-form eld expands into a noncommutative two-sphere,
which is interpreted as the formation of a spherical d2-d0 bound state. we also compare these
results with those calculated in the dual picture of a d2-brane carrying a nonvanishing u(1)
eld strength. the nal section provides some discussion of our results.

2 preliminaries

as we are interested in the dynamics of d-branes in nontrivial background elds, we begin by
establishing our conventions for the massless bosonic elds in the type ii superstring theories.
the bosonic part of the low-energy action for type iia string theory in ten dimensions may be
written as (see e.g., [21])3

iiia =

1

22 z d10xg(cid:26)e2(cid:20)r + 4()2 
(f (4))2(cid:27)

1

42 z bdc (3)dc (3)

1
12

h 2(cid:21)

(f (2))2

(4)

where g is the string-frame metric,  is the dilaton, h = db is the eld strength of the
neveu-schwarz two-form, while the ramond-ramond eld strengths are f (2) = dc (1) and
f (4) = dc (3) + h c (1).

for the type iib theory, we write the low-energy action as

iiib =

1

22 z d10xg(cid:26)e2(cid:20)r + 4()2 
(f (5))2(cid:27) +

(c (0))2

42 z (cid:18)c (4) +

(f (3) + c (0)h)2

b c (2)(cid:19) f (3) h

(5)

where the notation for the neveu-schwarz elds is the same as above, while f (3) = dc (2) and
f (5) = dc (4) + h c (2) are rr eld strengths, and c (0) is the rr scalar. we are adopting the
convention here that the the self duality constraint f (5) = f (5) is imposed by hand at the level
of the equations of motion[24].

given these actions, one may construct low energy background eld solutions corresponding
to various d-brane congurations  see, for example, refs. [25]. note, however, that our
conventions for the rr elds may dier slightly from the common choices in the supergravity
literature.4 the present choice coincides with the rr potentials appearing in the chern-simons
action (3). this may be conrmed by verifying that the gauge invariances of the low-energy
action are identical with those of world-volume d-brane action. further in the action, there
is an overall factor of (22)1 which in particular multiplies the terms involving the rr elds.
while this convention is standard in the literature on solutions of the supergravity equations

3further, the rr 9-form potential may be introduced to extend this (massless) iia supergravity to the

massive romans supergravity[22]  see also [23].

4for example, translating to the elds in [26] requires:

(c(0), c(1), c(2), c(3), c(4)) = ( = a(0),a(1), a(2), a(3), a(4)

(or some discussions of s-duality, e.g., refs. [27, 28] or matrix theory, e.g., ref. [20]), it is
an unusual normalization of the rr elds compared to the standard discussions of d-brane
physics  compare to ref. [3]. with regards to this point, our convention will be that the
dilaton  vanishes asymptotically, and then the ten-dimensional newtons constant is given
by 22 = 16gn = (2)78
sg2 where g is the (asymptotic) closed string coupling. finally,
these actions are presented in terms of the string-frame metric, and as usual converting to the
einstein-frame metric is accomplished with

g = e/2 g .

(6)

now we wish to recall the t-duality transformations of these supergravity elds. t-duality

acts on the neveu-schwarz elds as [29]:

gygy  byby

gyy

e2  =

gy =

(7)

e2
gyy

gyy =

gyy

g = g 
eb = b 

bygy  gyby

eby =
here y denotes the killing coordinate with respect to which the t-dualization is applied, while
,  denote any coordinate directions other than y. if y is identied on a circle of radius r, i.e.,
y  y + 2r, then after t-duality the radius becomes r = /r = 2
s/r. the string coupling
is also shifted as g = gs/r.

gyy

in section 3, it will be useful to implement t-duality on several killing directions in a
single transformation. such a transformation is most easily implemented by rst dening the
ten-by-ten matrix[30]

e = g + b .

(8)

then acting with t-duality on a set of directions denoted with i, j = p + 1, . . . , 9, the elds
transform as:

(9)
where a, b = 0, 1, . . . , p denote the remaining coordinate directions. here eij denotes the inverse
of eij, i.e., eikekj = i

j. one also has the dilaton transformation

eab = eab  eaieijejb ,

eaj = eakekj ,

eij = eij

e2  = e2 det(eij) .

(10)

of course, similar statements as above apply with regards to transforming the periodicities of
the xi directions and the string coupling constant g.

recall that t-duality transforms the type iia theory into the type iib theory and vice versa,
through its action on the world-sheet spinors[31, 5]. this aspect of t-duality is then apparent
in the transformations of the rr elds. the odd-form potentials of the iia theory are traded
for even-form potentials in the iib theory and vice versa. using the conventions adopted above,
the transformation rules for the rr potentials are [32]:

c (n)

y = c (n1)

  (n  1)

[|yg|]y

c (n1)
gyy

(11)

c (n)
 = c (n+1)

y + nc (n1)

[b]y + n(n  1)

c (n1)

[|yb||yg|]y

gyy

4

where in general one would have c (n) with n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 for the type iib theory, and
n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 for type iia theory  n = 9 and 10 being exceptional cases[2]. this range
of n is consistent with the implicit summation over rr potentials in the world-volume action
(3). however, recall that these are not all independent, rather they appear in dual pairs (for
n  8) where at linear order dc n = ()n(n1)/2dc (8n). of course, this is why the low-energy
supergravity theories (4) and (5) are written in terms of rr potentials with only n  4. the
t-duality transformations (11) are consistent with those derived from the supergravity actions
[21].

we now turn to consider the dp-branes. to begin, we remark that throughout we are
employing static gauge. that is rst we employ spacetime dieomorphisms to dene the ducial
world-volume as xi = 0 with i = p + 1, . . . , 9, and then with world-volume dieomorphisms,
we match the internal coordinates with the remaining spacetime coordinates on that surface,
a = xa with a = 0, 1, . . . , p. with this choice and the identication xi = 22
si, the general
formula for pull-backs, e.g.,

reduces to that given in eq. (2).

p [gab] = g

x
a

x
b

(12)

as described in the introduction, the low-energy dynamics of n coincident d-branes is

described by a nonabelian u(n) gauge theory [11]. our conventions are such that

aa = a(n)

a tn,

fab = aab  baa + i[aa, ab]

(13)

where tn are n2 hermitian generators5 with tr(tn tm) = n nm. the gauge elds are accom-
panied by 9  p adjoint scalars i with

dai = ai + i[aa, i] .

(14)

note that our conventions are such that both the gauge elds and adjoint scalars have the
dimensions of length1  hence the appearance of the string scale in xi = 22

si.

now t-duality acts to change the dimension of a dp-branes world-volume [3]. the two
possibilities are: (i) if a coordinate transverse to the dp-brane, e.g., y = xp+1, is t-dualized, it
becomes a d(p + 1)-brane where y is now the extra world-volume direction; and (ii) if a world-
volume coordinate on the dp-brane, e.g., y = xp, is t-dualized, it becomes a d(p  1)-brane
where y is now an extra transverse direction.
in the process, the role of the corresponding
world-volume elds change as

(i) p+1  ap+1 ,

(ii) ap  p ,

(15)

while the remaining components of a and scalars  are left unchanged.

if we focus on case (ii), the corresponding eld strengths appearing in the world-volume

action, (1) and (3), transform accordingly

5there are certain subtleties to describing d-branes on a compact space [33, 34], but we will not have to

fap  dap .

(16)

consider these in the following.

5

we will show below that the modied interactions appear precisely in the correct way to yield
the pull-backs (2) to the reduced world-volume. the pull-backs to the original dp-brane world-
volume will in general involve dpi. now one would apply a t-duality transformation along xp
only when all elds are independent of this coordinate. hence if we were considering a single
dp-brane with abelian world-volume elds, we would have

dpi = pi = 0

(17)

and so t-duality would not generate any new interactions from the pull-backs. however, in the
nonabelian case, we would only require

dpi = pi + i[ap, i] = i[ap, i] .

which need not vanish in general.6 hence t-duality would yield

dpi  i[p, i] .

(18)

(20)

generating new world-volume interactions involving scalar commutator terms. these interac-
tions would not be included if we simply introduced an overall gauge trace and substituted
nonabelian elds everywhere in eqs. (1) and (3), and hence the resulting actions are inconsis-
tent with t-duality. it is taking care to retain all of the commutators, which distinguishes the
present investigation from previous discussions of t-duality in the context of d-branes [35, 36].

with the conventions, the tension of an individual dp-brane, i.e., the coecient appearing

in the born-infeld term (1), is as usual [3]

tp =

2

g(2s)p+1 .

(21)

however, because of the unconventional normalization of the rr elds noted above, the
charge of an individual dp-brane, i.e., the coecient appearing in the chern-simons action
(3), is

2

(22)

p =

g(2s)p+1 .

hence we have p = tp, which simplies some of our calculations. finally, in the following
discussion, it will be convenient to dene:

 = 22

s .

(23)

3 born-infeld action

in the previous section, we showed that merely extending the abelian born-infeld action (1) with
the substitution of nonabelian elds and an overall gauge trace would miss certain interactions
involving commutators of the scalar elds. for example, in a particular limit, the correct action

6here, one can think that the scalars i are constant along xp up to a gauge transformation

(19)
where vaa = p is the killing vector in the xp-direction, and the gauge parameter would be  = vaaa. this
point of view is analogous to the generalized analysis of t-duality for spacetime elds in ref. [37].

lvi = vadai = i[, i]

for n coincident dp-branes should reduce to (p + 1)-dimensional u(n) super-yang-mills theory
which has a scalar potential proportional to tr [i, j]2. this potential would not appear in
the naive construction suggested above.

our approach will be to apply this construction, but only for the d9-brane action to provide
a starting point. in this case, there are no world-volume scalar elds, because the d-brane lls
the entire space and there are no transverse directions. given the absence of any scalars,
making the naive construction will not omit the commutator terms described above.7 thus our
nonabelian born-infeld action for the d9-brane is

sbi = t9z d10 tr(cid:18)eqdet (gab + bab +  fab)(cid:19) .

(24)

note that in the absence of any transverse directions, there is no need to introduce a pull-back
on gab + bab. now our strategy is to apply a t-duality transformation, using eqs. (9), (10) and
(15), on 9p coordinates xi with i = p+1, . . . , 9 to eq. (24) to produce the corresponding born-
infeld action for a dp-brane. note that in eq. (24), the background elds are in general functions
of all of the world-volume coordinates. for the purposes of the t-duality transformation, we
must consider the special case that the elds are independent of the coordinates xi. this
produces a dp-brane action functional of the background elds for this special case, but we
assume the extension to the general case is simply to allow the background elds in the new
action to be functions of all of the spacetime coordinates. the latter entails introducing a
functional dependence on the nonabelian scalars  see eq. (50) below  which may seem a
radical alteration, but recall that string scattering amplitudes have already provided evidence
for this structure [16, 17].

focusing on the determinant in the d9-brane action, in the notation of eq. (8), we have

d = det (eab +  fab)

and then applying the t-duality transformation rules (9,15) yields

d = det(cid:18) eab  eaieijejb +  fab eakekj +  daj
eij + i [i, j] (cid:19)

eikekb   dbi

where as before, eij denotes the inverse of eij.

(25)

(26)

now it is instructive to consider this construction with the abelian theory for which the
commutators vanish and dai = ai. in this case, the matrix inside the determinant above
may be manipulated to give

d = det
= det



(27)

eab  eaieijejb +  fab

+(eakekl +  al)(elb +  elmbm)

eakekj +  aj

0

eab +  akekb +  eakbk eakekj +  aj

+2 akeklbl +  fab

0

eij

eij



= det (p [e]ab +  fab) det(eij) .

7of course, we could have also begun with the d8-brane where again there can be no nontrivial commutators

because there is a single transverse scalar eld.

7

hence the scalar derivative terms which were generated by t-duality provide precisely nec-
essary terms to yield the pull-back of eab to the new reduced world-volume. next by the
transformation rule (10), the dilaton factor in eq. (24) is replaced by

e 

e
eij

(28)

which provides precisely the necessary factor to cancel the second determinant above when
the latter appears under the square root in the action. in the d9-brane action, the invariant
directions, i.e., xi, can be integrated out before the t-duality transformation so that the overall
prefactor becomes t9q9
i=p+1(2ri). now taking into account the transformations of the radii,
ri  2
i=p+1 ri, this leaves an overall factor
of precisely tp in front of the t-dual action [3]. assembling all of these factors yields the t-dual
action

s/ri, and of the string coupling in t9, g  g9p

s /q9

sbi = tpz dp+1 (cid:18)eqdet(p [g + b]ab +  fab)(cid:19)

(29)

which has precisely the desired form. thus we have recovered the result that in the abelian
theory, the born-infeld action (1) is compatible with t-duality [35].

unfortunately the full determinant (26) including the commutator terms does not lead to

such a simple result as in eq. (27). in this case, it is useful to dene

then following manipulations as in eq. (27), one nds

qi

j  i

j + i [i, k] ekj .

d = det(cid:16)pheab + eai(q1  )ijejbi +  fab(cid:17) det(eij) det(qi

j) .

(30)

(31)

note the second index on the expression (q1  )ij has been raised using eij (rather than
gij). the remaining ingredients of the calculation are precisely as above, and the nal t-dual
action becomes

sbi = tpz dp+1 tr(cid:18)eqdet (p [eab + eai(q1  )ijejb] +  fab) det(qi

j)(cid:19) .

(32)

an interesting features of this result is that it now contains a product of two determinants.8 it
is the second determinant which supplies the standard scalar potential in the at space limit.
setting g =  and b = 0, one may expand this factor to nd

qdet qi

j = 1 

2
4

[i, j][i, j] + . . .

(33)

of course, this expansion also contains higher order potential terms, and in general, more
commutator terms arise in the rst determinant factor through the expression (q1  )ij.

now the born-infeld action is highly nonlinear, and so the proposed action (32) is incomplete
without a precise prescription for how the gauge trace should be implemented. to incorporate
the nonabelian symmetry of the world-volume elds tseytlin[18]  see also [19]  has suggested
that one should supplement the usual born-infeld form (for a at space background) with a

8this feature was noted for the at space action in ref. [19].

symmetrized trace over gauge indices. that is, to leading order all commutators of the eld
strengths should be dropped. unfortunately this action does not seem to capture the full
physics of the infrared limit[38], and it appears that in general nontrivial commutators must be
included at sixth-order in the eld strength[39, 40]. on the other hand in congurations with
supersymmetry, this action seems to properly describe the physics of the nonabelian yang-mills
elds [41], and even provides solutions of the full open-string equations of motion [42].

in the above action (32), we will adopt the same symmetrized trace prescription. that is,
the trace is completely symmetric between all nonabelian expressions of the form fab, dai and
i[i, j]. in part, this prescription is adopted as a practical matter as these objects were treated
as commuting in all of the manipulations leading up to eq. (32). given the previous results
[39, 40] then, we expect that in general this action will only incorporate the correct interactions
involving these objects at second and fourth order. so for example, potential terms arising
from the expansion of det(q) in eq. (33) may not be reliable for sixth and higher orders in the
commutators. however, there is some hope that it will still properly describe the physics of
supersymmetric congurations to all orders.

this discussion has not addressed how the gauge trace should be implemented for the
nonabelian scalars appearing in the functional dependence of the background elds. we will
leave this question until section 5.

4 chern-simons action

for the abelian theory of an individual d-brane, one can show that the chern-simons action
(3) is compatible with t-duality [35]. in general the analysis is quite complicated because of
the interplay of the rr and the neveu-schwarz elds.9 for example, t-duality (7) acting on
the two-form b in general introduces terms involving gy, but these are all precisely cancelled
by the terms involving the metric appear in the transformation of rr potentials (11). the
discussion, however, is greatly simplied for the case of at space, i.e., g =  and b = 0.
in this case, the t-duality transformations of the rr potentials become [3]

c (n)

y = c (n1)
 ,

 = c (n+1)
c (n)

y ,

while the action (3) reduces to

scs = pz phx c (n)i e f .

(34)

(35)

verifying the consistency of the form of this action with t-duality is relatively straightforward,
and we sketch the calculation here. we consider the case where t-duality acts on a world-
volume coordinate, e.g., y = xp, so the dp-brane becomes a d(p 1)-brane. now the integrand
in eq. (35) is a form on the world-volume and so the index y will appear on precisely one
tensor in each of the terms in the sum. for the abelian theory, the pull-back involves ordinary
derivatives of the scalars, and so as yi = 0, the existing pull-back terms are unaected by
9recently there have been some interesting suggestions on the transformation properties of the rr elds
for higher dimensional tori[43]. this formalism may simplify the analysis of the general case in the present
discussion.

the t-duality transformation, i.e., they already coincide with the pull-back to the new reduced
world-volume from the transverse directions xi with i = p + 1, . . . , 9. hence we may consider a
generic term of the form

where again y appears as one and only one of the indices. if this index is carried by the rr
potential, then the t-duality transformation (34) simply removes this index leaving

p [c (n)]a1an fb1c1    fbmcm

(36)

p [c (n1)]a1an1 fb1c1    fbmcm

(37)

where the prime on the pull-back indicates that it only involves ai with i = p + 1, . . . , 9. the
other possibility is that the y index is carried by one of the gauge eld strengths, in which case
eqs. (34) and (16) yield a contribution of the form

m p [c (n+1)]a1any fb1c1    fbm1cm1 bmy .

(38)

hence these contributions complete the pull-back p  which would have appeared in eq. (37) if we
had begun with n + 2 and m 1 in eq. (36). this gives the essence of the calculation. checking
the consistency in detail requires verication that a few factors and signs work out properly, and
that the prefactor in the t-dual action becomes p1 (in the same way as tp is transformed
in the previous section).
in the end, one does nd that the action (35) is compatible with
t-duality [35]. the calculations become far more involved for the case of general background
elds, i.e., arbitrary g and b, however the consistency of the full chern-simons action (3)
can still be veried on a case-by-case basis [35].

now we argued in section 2 that the form action in eqs. (3) and (35) fails to include certain
interactions involving the commutators of the nonabelian scalar elds. so let us simply present
the nonabelian generalization of the at space chern-simons action (35):

scs = pz tr(cid:16)phei iix c (n)i e f(cid:17) .

(39)

beyond the generalization of all of world-volume elds to their nonabelian counterparts (in-
cluding in the functional dependence of the rr potentials) and the inclusion of an overall
gauge trace, there is the appearance of the exponential exp(i ii) inside the pull-back. here
i denotes the interior product by i regarded as a vector in the transverse space. acting on
forms, the interior product is an anticommuting operator of form degree 1, e.g.,

1
2

c (2)

c (2) =

 dxdx
 dx
iwivc (2) = wv c (2)

ivc (2) = v c (2)

 = iviwc (2) .

(40)

in particular, for ordinary vectors one has (iv)2 = 0. the exponential makes a nontrivial
contribution in eq. (39) because of the nonabelian nature of the displacement vectors i. there
one has

iic (2) = ji c (2)

ij =

c (2)
ij

[j, i]

(41)

2

and so the exponential produces precisely the desired commutators.

10

verifying the consistency of the action (39) with t-duality follows essentially the same
argument as above for the abelian action (35). again, we outline the calculation where t-
duality acts on a world-volume coordinate, y = xp. the only real dierence is that the pull-back
now involves gauge covariant derivatives of the scalars. hence since dyi = i[ay, i] which in
general is nonvanishing, t-duality acting on the pull-back will now give rise to new interactions.
here, we consider a generic term of the form

(i)lp [(ii)lc (n+2l)]a1an fb1c1    fbmcm

(42)

where again y appears as one and only one of the indices. first since the scalars above only
carry indices i = p+1, . . . , 9, the operator (ii)l will remain unaected by the t-duality. if the
y index is carried by the rr potential after the pull-back, then the t-duality transformation
(34) simply removes this index leaving

(i)l

l!

p [(i i )lc (n+2l1)]a1an1 fb1c1    fbmcm

(43)

where the prime on the pull-back indicates that it only involves dai with i = p + 1, . . . , 9, and
similarly i  indicates that the displacement vector in the interior product only has components
in these same directions, i.e., the original transverse space. another possibility is that y appears
as one of the indices ak in eq. (42), but that it is actually carried by dyi in the pull-back. in
this case, the t-duality transformation yields

2

(i)l+1

l!

p [(i i )l(iy i )c (n+2l+1)]a1an1 fb1c1    fbmcm .

(44)

the role of these terms is to complete the interior product operators that would appear in a
term given in eq. (43) if one replaced l by l + 1 in eq. (42). that is, one can write

(i)l+1
(l + 1)!

(ii)l+1 =

(i)l+1
(l + 1)!

(i i )l+1 + 2

(i)l+1

l!

(i i )l(iyi )

(45)

when one realizes that y can at most appear in one of the interior products since the combined
operator is acting on a form. the nal possibility, as in the abelian case, is that the y index is
carried by one of the gauge eld strengths, in which case eqs. (34) and (16) yield a contribution
of the form

m (i)lp [(ii)lc (n+2l+1)]a1any fb1c1    fbm1cm1 dbmy .

(46)
as before the role of these contributions is to complete the pull-back p  which would have
appeared in eq. (43) if we had begun with n + 2 and m  1 in eq. (42). one point to note
is that in collecting contributions to form interactions of the form given in eq. (42) but now
on the reduced world-volume with a = 0, . . . , p  1, one will never nd iy and day in the
same term as they cannot both be contracted on the same rr form. the above discussion
describes the core of the consistency calculations. again we have left out some of the details,
and simply state that one will nd t-duality will transform the action (39) for a dp-brane to
the d(p  1)-brane action with the same precise form. the reader is invited to verify these
details for herself.

in extending eq. (39) beyond the case of at space, the chern-simons action for the non-

abelian world-volume theory becomes

scs = pz tr(cid:16)phei ii(x c (n) eb)i e f(cid:17) .

11

(47)

it is clear that this action reduces to the expected form (3) for the abelian theory of a single
dp-brane. the previous discussion verifying consistency with t-duality of the action (39) for
at space generalizes here in a straightforward way for more general backgrounds, as long as we
impose the restriction that gy = 0 which keeps the transformations (11) of the rr potentials
relatively simple. one fact that is revealed by such an analysis is that the interior products in
eq. (47) must act on both the neveu-schwarz two-form and the rr potentials. for example, one
would nd such interior products in eq. (44) if the general transformation of the rr potential
was applied in the previous discussion. calculations to verify that eq. (47) is consistent with
t-duality g is completely general become much more involved, however, we have veried
the consistency of this action (47) in certain specic cases, e.g., considering the d2-brane with
arbitrary g and b, but c (n) = 0 for n  5.

let us make a few remarks on the interpretation of eq. (47). first, note that the integrand
is to be evaluated by considering the expression in each set of brackets in turn, from the

innermost around p c (n)eb to the outermost for the gauge trace. in particular, this means
that rst p c (n)eb is expanded as a sum of forms in the ten-dimensional spacetime, and so

only a nite set of terms in the exponential will contribute. then the exponential exp(i ii)
acts on this sum of forms, and so again only a nite set of terms in this second exponential will
contribute.

second, just as in the previous section with the born-infeld action, the proposed action (47)
is incomplete without a precise prescription for how the gauge trace should be implemented.
here, we will adopt the same symmetrized trace prescription as in the born-infeld action.
that is, the trace is completely symmetric between all nonabelian expressions of the form
fab, dai and i[i, j]. further here we must extend this symmetrization to the individual
background eld components, each of which is in general a functional of the nonabelian scalars.
this symmetrization must be adopted here as a practical matter as all of these objects were
treated as commuting in the calculations which veried that eq. (47) was compatible with t-
duality. given the complicated possible functional dependence on i which could appear in the
background elds, the above description of the gauge trace is still not complete. we will leave
the question of its precise implementation to the following section.

it is well-known that a dp-brane couples not only to the rr potential with form degree
n = p + 1 [2], but also that it can couple to the rr potentials with n = p 1, p 3, . . . through
the additional interactions with the two-form b and world-volume eld strength f appearing in
the action (3) [9]. here we see from the nonabelian action (47) that a dp-brane can also couple
to the rr potentials with n = p + 3, p + 5, . . . through the additional interactions involving
commutators of the nonabelian scalars. to make these couplings more explicit, consider the
d0-brane action (for which f vanishes):

scs = 0z tr p"c (1) + i ii(cid:16)c (3) + c (1)b(cid:17)

where we assume that 0 = t in static gauge. we see here that the nonabelian action (47) is
giving interactions reminiscent of those appearing in matrix theory [44, 45]. this similarity is,
of course, no accident, as we will see in the next section by comparing to the couplings derived
from matrix theory by taylor and van raamsdonk [20]. for example, there is linear coupling
to c 3, which is the potential corresponding to d2-brane charge,

i 0z tr phiic (3)i = i


2

0z dt tr(cid:16)c (3)

tjk [k, j] + c (3)

ijk dtk [k, j](cid:17)

(49)

note that the rst term on the right hand side has the form of a source for d2-brane charge.
this is essentially the interaction central to the construction of d2-branes in matrix theory
with the large n limit [44, 45]. here, however, with nite n, this term vanishes upon taking the
trace if c (3)
tjk was simply a constant or a function of the world-volume coordinate t. however, in
general one should regard these components of the rr three-form as functionals of i. hence,
while there would be no monopole coupling to d2-brane charge, nontrivial expectation values
of the scalars can give rise to couplings to an innite series of higher multipole moments. in
addition, we will discuss in section 6 that in a nontrivial background c (3), this interaction gives
rise to additional terms in the potential for the scalars.

5 comparison with matrix theory

thus far, we have constructed a nonabelian world-volume action for test dp-branes in general
background elds. the action consists of two parts, the born-infeld term (32) and the chern-
simons term (47). our construction was guided by the simple principle that the result should
be consistent with the familiar rules of t-duality. in this section, we would like to discuss how
our results measure up to some previous considerations of nonabelian dp-brane actions. this
exercise will also be useful in providing a precise prescription for the implementation of the
gauge trace in our action  see the comparison to matrix theory, below.

first, we will remark on the connection of our born-infeld action (32) to tseytlins proposal
[18] for a nonabelian born-infeld action for ten-dimensional super-yang-mills theory. tseytlins
action is, of course, precisely recovered in eq. (32) with p = 9, i.e., eq. (24) and a at space
background, i.e., g =  and b = 0. this action [18] correctly yields the f 2 and f 4
interactions expected for low energy superstring theory[46], however, it seems to require mod-
ications [39, 40] at order f 6.
introducing a general metric (but keeping b = 0) in our
d9-brane action (24) simply covariantizes the super-yang-mills action with minimal coupling
to the metric, i.e., the same f 2 and f 4 (and all higher order) interactions are recovered but now
the index contractions are made with the curved space metric. of course, t-duality requires
the inclusion of b in eq. (24), since t-duality (7) interchanges components of the metric and
this two-form. as usual, the factor of exp() is required in the action as it must reproduce
interactions derived from superstring disk amplitudes [3]. hence we are arguing that eq. (24),
our starting point in the construction of the born-infeld action (32), provides the minimal
extension of tseytlins action [18] to include nontrivial neveu-schwarz backgrounds. as men-
tioned above, the connection with tseytlins action also points out the limitations of eq. (32),

13

namely that we must expect that there are corrections at order six in fab, dai and/or i[i, j].
given that the precise form of the sixth order corrections to tseytlins action are known[39],
presumably those to eq. (32) could be determined by covariantizing the at space corrections,
multiplying by exp(), and demanding consistency with t-duality.

douglas [13] observed that whatever their form, the nonabelian world-volume actions should
contain a single gauge trace, as do both eqs. (32) and (47). this observation again stems from
the fact that these actions are encoding the low energy interactions derived from disk amplitudes
in superstring theory. since the disk has a single boundary, the single gauge trace arises from
the standard open string prescription of tracing over chan-paton factors on each world-sheet
boundary. in particular, this means that the background (closed string) elds appearing in the
action cannot be functionals of the d-brane center-of-mass coordinate xi = 
n tr i. hence,
it is natural to assume that the background elds are functionals of the nonabelian scalar
elds instead [13]. one can sharpen this reasoning by observing that the only dierence in
the superstring amplitudes between the u(1) and the u(n) theories is that the amplitudes
in the latter case are multiplied by an additional trace of chan-paton factors. hence up to
commutator corrections, the low energy interactions should be the same in both cases. hence
since the background elds are functionals of the neutral u(1) scalars in the abelian theory,
they must be precisely the same functionals of the adjoint scalars in the nonabelian theory, up
to commutator corrections. similarly the pull-back was constructed with neutral scalars in the
abelian theory, and so the adjoint scalars play the same role in the nonabelian theory [15].

while we have indicated that the background elds are functionals of the nonabelian scalars,
let us be more precise on how this is actually implemented [16]. for example, consider the case
of a dp-brane propagating in a curved background g0
(x). first we impose static gauge
as described above eq. (12), and hence the spacetime coordinates are split into world-volume
coordinates, xa = a, and transverse coordinates, xi. then the metric functional appearing in
the d-brane action would be given by a nonabelian taylor expansion [16]

g = exphi xii g0

(a, xi)|xi=0

i1    in (xi1    xin )g0

(a, xi)|xi=0 .

xn=0

(50)

the same nonabelian taylor expansions arise in the context of matrix theory, e.g., [47, 48].
since the partial derivatives above all commute, there does not seem to be room for commutator
corrections to this taylor expansion, i.e., it naturally produces an expression symmetric in all of
the im. the ambiguities come in the full nonlinear action where the trace must be implemented
over is from dierent background eld components, as well nonabelian terms such as fab.

we also mention that explicit calculations of superstring amplitudes [16, 17, 49] yield a
detailed agreement with the actions given in eqs. (32) and (47). in particular, disk amplitudes
with one closed string state and two open strings [16] reveal terms to second order in the
nonabelian taylor expansion (50), as well as contributions of the adjoint scalars to the pull-
backs. some disk amplitudes with one closed and three open strings have been evaluated [17],
and here some of the single commutator corrections can be seen. for example, one sees the
commutator arising from the interior products in eq. (49).

the main comparison which we wish make is between certain interactions in eqs. (32) and
(47), and those derived from matrix theory [20]. taylor and van raamsdonk [20] have recently

14

calculated all of the linear couplings of (massless bosonic) closed string elds to d0-branes
in type iia string theory, by transcribing the analogous couplings to d=11 supergravity elds
derived for matrix theory [47, 48] in the sen-seiberg limit [50]. the nonabelian action proposed
here contains analogous linear couplings (as well as nonlinear couplings). a detailed comparison
the linear couplings derived by these the two approaches yields an precise agreement, to the
order that the calculations are expected to be valid, up to two caveats, which will be discussed
below.10 i will illustrate these comparisons by providing the detailed expressions for two cases,
the linear couplings of the dilaton and the rr ve-form potential.

taylor and van raamsdonk [20] present the linear coupling to the dilaton as

z ds

n!

xn=0

(xi1    xin ) i (i1in)



,

(51)

where xi1    xin (s) are the derivatives of the background dilaton eld evaluated along the
d0 world-line, i.e., the c-number coecients in the taylor series for the background eld (50).
the various moments have the form

i (i1in)


= str(i, x i1, . . . , x in)

(52)

where the x i are the nonabelian matrix displacements completing the taylor expansion (50) of
the background eld. in eq. (52), we have dropped an additional term including extra fermionic
contributions to the higher multipole moments  as we have not included the world-volume
fermions in any of our calculations, we can make no comparison for these terms. as well as the
nonabelian displacements, these currents are constructed with i, the zeroth moment of the
background eld coupling. the latter is an expression constructed from dsx i and i[x i, x j],
as well as  and [x i, ]  these fermionic terms will again be dropped for the purposes of the
present comparisons. the symmetrized trace indicated by str(  ) indicates that the gauge
trace takes a symmetrized average over all orderings of factors of dsx i and i[x i, x j], and the
individual nonabelian displacements x i, appearing in the higher moments. this form of the
coupling generalizes to all of the background elds, and so the essential step is now to identify
the form of the zeroth moment currents.

from the expressions provided by taylor and van raamsdonk [20], one determines the

zeroth moment of the dilaton coupling to be

where r is the compactication radius of the tenth spatial dimension in m-theory. this expres-
sion gives the leading order contributions in an expansion in small dsx i and i[x i, x j]. the
o(v6) indicates that there will be new contributions at sixth order in these expressions, while
the oc(v4) indicates that there could also be additional commutator corrections at fourth order
10a further caveat is that certain ambiguous signs in the matrix model result are actually xed by comparing

to the d-brane couplings [51].

15

in the expansion. here we have again dropped all of the fermion contributions calculated in
ref. [20].

now let us compare to the linear dilaton coupling that arises in d-brane action derived
here. expanding the born-infeld term (32) around at space keeping only the term linear in
the dilaton yields

t0z dt tr(cid:20)(t, )q(1  2dti q1

ij dtj) detqij(cid:21)

where from eq. (30),

qij = ij + i[i, j]

(54)

(55)

in at space. we see that this can be interpreted precisely as the general form given in eqs. (51)
and (52). there is the background eld (t, ) which implicitly contains a nonabelian taylor
expansion, as in eq. (50). this multiplies an expression involving dt and i[i, j], i.e., the
zeroth moment. of course, all of the linear couplings derived from the d-brane action will
have this same general form, and so there is agreement between two calculations at this general
level. one must make a detailed comparison of the zeroth moments then, to determine if
there is in fact a precise agreement between the two calculations.
in the present case, it is
straightforward to show that the expansion of the square root in eq. (54) in fact yields precisely
the dilaton zeroth moment in eq. (53). rather than repeat the lengthy formula above, let us
describe the expansion by saying that it yields: (i) at zero order, simply 1, as in eq. (53), (ii)
at second order, the standard low energy kinetic and potential terms for the nonabelian scalar
(up to an overall sign), as in eq. (53), and (iii) at fourth order, the dimensional reduction of
the stringy corrections appearing in the d=10 sym theory at fourth order in eld strengths
[46, 18], again as in eq. (53)  that the terms above provide the desired dimensionally reduced
is manifest in the notation of ref. [20]. we should also comment that all of the quantities in
the calculations of ref. [20] are dimensionless, i.e., they have set  = 1. to restore the standard

engineering dimensions of our notation, one would set: x i  i, xi  xi, s  t/,
and r  r/. then the agreement between eqs. (51) and (54) is completed by matching

r1 = t0, which agrees with the standard duality between type iia superstring theory and
d=11 m-theory where r = gs [1, 44]. in fact, the d-brane calculation indicates that in fact
there are no additional commutator corrections at fourth order in the zeroth moment of the
dilaton coupling (53). further the expansion of the d-brane action could be carried out to
the next order, where we know there are extra commutator corrections but these have been
explicitly calculated [40]. hence in principle, one could use these results to calculate the o(v6)
corrections to eq. (53). of course, this is only the next term in an innite series, and so there
would still be unknown terms at o(v8).

at this point, we come to the rst of the aforementioned caveats. in the d-brane calculation,
the higher moments of the dilaton coupling which are implicit in eq. (54) are actually ambiguous,
since we have as yet not provided a specic prescription for implementing the gauge trace. on
the other hand, there is no such ambiguity in the matrix theory calculation which comes with
a specic symmetrized trace prescription. hence matrix theory guides us to the appropriate
prescription: the gauge trace takes a symmetrized average over all orderings of fab, dai,
i[i, j], and as well the individual i appearing in the functional dependence of the background
elds. we adopt this as our trace prescription in both the born-infeld (32) and chern-simons
(47) actions. this will ensure the agreement of all of higher moments in the linear couplings

16

to those calculated from matrix theory [20]. note that we are proposing that this prescription
should be extended to all of the nonlinear couplings with background elds as well. this
maximally symmetrized trace prescription also agrees with the requirements that we outlined
for the trace in the previous two sections  namely, it should be symmetric in fab, dai and
i[i, j], following ref. [18], and also that the individual components of background elds should
commute under the trace.

now let us consider the linear coupling of the rr ve-form, which taylor and van raams-

donk [20] write as

z ds

xn=0

1

n!(cid:16)xi1    xin c (3)

(cid:17) i (i1in)

4

,

(56)

where their notation indicates that this potential generates the eld strength that is dual to
that of the rr three-form. now the various moments again have the form

i (i1in)
4

= str(i 

4

, x i1, . . . , x in) .

(57)

as the zeroth moment now carries an antisymmetric set of spacetime indices there are two
distinct cases depending on whether or not one of the indices coincides with the world-volume
direction s. taylor and van raamsdonk [20] derived that

3

2r(cid:16)[x [i, x j][x k, x l]] + o(v4)(cid:17) ,

= 
= 6m +ijklm 

15

2r(cid:16)dsx [i[x j, x k][x l, x m]] + o(v5)(cid:17) .

the [  ] enclosing the indices indicates that the expressions are completely antisymmetrized,
and as usual, all of the fermion contributions have been ignored. in the d-brane action (48),
the linear coupling to this rr potential is

(58)

(59)

(60)

2
z dt trhc (5)

ijklmdt[i[j, k][l, m]]i .

comparing these expressions, one nds that there is precise agreement between the explicit
couplings as before provided that the potentials in the two calculations are related as: c (5) =
60 c (3). further the d-brane results suggest that there are no higher order corrections in
eqs. (58) and (59), or to the zeroth moments of any of the rr potentials calculated in ref. [20].

at this point, the reader should think that we have concluded too quickly that there is a
precise agreement in the previous calculation, as we have not commented on the contribution
m +ijklm in eq. (59). this brings us to the second of the caveats that we mentioned at the
outset above. above, of course, we only nd a precise agreement if m +ijklm = 0. in matrix
theory, m +ijklm is the transverse 5-brane charge, and determining this operator remains a
famous unresolved puzzle. so here through the d-brane action, string theory is making a
denite prediction as to the nature of this operator, namely, m +ijklm = 0. this result is also
required for the agreement of other couplings, as well. the matrix theory calculation [20]
includes couplings to the six-form potential which would be the dual of the neveu-schwarz
two form. the zeroth moments in this case are given by m +ijklm and m ijklmn, both of which
remain undetermined in matrix theory. in the d-brane action, (32) and (47), there are simply

17

no such couplings, and so agreement requires both m +ijklm = 0 and m ijklmn = 0. actually,
here and above, we have only really shown that what vanishes is the part of these operators
which is independent of the world-volume fermions. however, it seems clear that introducing
the fermions in a supersymmetric action will not create any new couplings to b .

6 dielectric-branes

in this section, we begin an investigation the physical eects arising from the new nonabelian
interactions in the full world-volume action, i.e., the sum of eqs. (32) and (47). in particular,
here we will focus on the potential for the nonabelian scalars. to begin, consider this potential
for dp-branes in a at space background, i.e., g =  with all other elds vanishing. in this
case, the entire scalar potential originates in the born-infeld term (32) as

v = tp trqdet(qi

j) = ntp +

tp2

tr([i, j] [j, i]) + . . .

at low energies, the discussion focuses on the leading nontrivial contribution above

vsy m = 

tp2

4

tr([i, j] [i, j]) ,

(61)

(62)

which corresponds to the potential for ten-dimensional u(n) super-yang-mills theory reduced
to p + 1 dimensions. a nontrivial set of extrema of this potential (and the full expression in
eq. (61)) is given by taking the 9  p scalars as constant commuting matrices, i.e.,

[i, j] = 0

(63)

for all i and j. since they are commuting, the i may be simultaneously diagonalized to give

i =

here, the eigenvalues are interpreted as the separated positions in the transverse space of n
fundamental dp-branes  see, for example, ref. [34]. this solution reects the fact that a
system of n parallel dp-branes is supersymmetric, and they can rest in static equilibrium with
arbitrary separations in the transverse space [3].

we have seen that going from at space to a general background introduces a vast num-
ber of new nonderivative scalar interactions in the world-volume action. these arise from the
functional dependence of the background elds on the scalars, and the appearance of extra
nonabelian commutators. various physical eects governed by both of these types of inter-
actions have previously been considered. for example, the former interactions are important
in determining the dynamics of test dp-branes in nontrivial backgrounds, e.g., [52].
in the
context of matrix theory, the role of the second set of interactions that was emphasized was
to allow dp-branes supporting noncommuting congurations of the scalars to act a sources for
rr potentials with form degree greater than p + 1, e.g., [20, 44, 45, 48].

18

here we want to consider another interesting physical eect  that is the d-brane analog of
the dielectric eect in ordinary electromagnetism. when dp-branes are placed in a nontrivial
background eld for which the dp-branes would normally be regarded as neutral, e.g., nontrivial
f (n) with n > p + 2, new terms will be induced in the scalar potential, and generically one
should expect that there will be new extrema beyond those found in at space, i.e., eq. (63). in
particular, there can be nontrivial extrema with noncommuting expectation values of the i,
e.g., with tri = 0 but tr(i)2 6= 0. this would correspond to the external eld polarizing
the dp-branes to expand into a (higher dimensional) noncommutative world-volume geometry.
this is the analog of the familiar electromagnetic process where an external eld may induce a
separation of charges in neutral materials. in the latter, the polarized material will carry then
an electric dipole and possibly higher multipoles. the d-brane analog of the latter is that when
the world-volume theory is at a noncommutative extremum, the nontrivial expectation values of
the scalars will cause the dp-branes to act as a source for new background elds. to make these
ideas explicit, we will illustrate the process with a simple example below. below, we consider
n d0-branes in a constant background rr eld f (4), i.e., the eld strength associated with
d2-brane charge. we will nd that the d0-branes expand into a noncommutative conguration
which represents the spherical bound state of a d2-brane and n d0-branes.

6.1 dielectric d0-branes

otherwise

(65)

note that f carries the dimensions length1, and we are assuming 0 = t, with the static gauge
condition. since f (4) = dc (3), in order to construct the scalar potential, we must consider the
coupling of the d0-branes to the rr three-form potential,

ijt (, t) + c (3)

ijk(, t) dtk(cid:17)i

ijk(t) dtk + . . .(cid:17)i

where in the second line, we are explicitly introducing the nonabelian taylor series expansion
(50) of the rr potential. as noted below eq. (49), the quadratic term containing c (3)
ijt (t)
vanishes. focusing on the terms that are cubic in the scalar elds, we have

i20z dt tr(cid:16)jihkkc (3)

20z dt tr(cid:16)ijk(cid:17) f (4)

tijk(t) .

(67)

here, the second term in the rst line was integrated by parts to produce the nal expression.
this nal form might have been anticipated since one should expect that the induced potential
can only depend on gauge invariant expressions of the background eld. given that for simplic-
ity we are considering a constant background f (4), this interaction (67) is the only term that
need be considered. all of the higher order terms implicit in eq. (66) will give rise to potential
terms depending on derivatives of the four-form eld strength, and hence vanish. combining

19

eq. (67) with the leading order born-infeld potential (62) yields the scalar potential of interest
for the present problem

v () = 

2t0

tr([i, j]2) 

i

20tr(cid:16)ijk(cid:17) f (4)

(68)

substituting the background eld (65) and demanding v ()/i = 0 yields the equation

for extrema

0 = [[i, j], j] + i f ijk[j, k] .

(69)

note that commuting matrices (63) still solve this equation, and at this extremum describing
separated d0-branes, the value of the potential is simply v0 = 0.

as an ansatz for a noncommuting solution, let us consider constant scalars satisfying

substituting this ansatz into eq. (69) yields a solution for

[i, j] = 2i r ijkk .

r = f /2 .

hence we have nontrivial solutions of eq. (69)

i =

f
2

i

where i are any nn matrix representation of the su(2) algebra

[i, j] = 2i ijk k .

for the moment, let us focus on the irreducible representation for which one nds

tr[(i

n)2] =

n
3

(n2  1)

for i = 1, 2, 3.

now evaluating the value of the potential (68) for this new solution yields

vn =

tr[(i)2] = 

23
sf 4
6g

n(n2  1) .

(70)

(71)

(72)

(73)

(74)

(75)

hence the noncommutative solution solution has lower energy than the solution of commuting
matrices, and so the latter conguration separated d0-branes is unstable towards condensing
out into this noncommutative solution.

of course, the irreducible nn representation provides only one solution for eq. (72). one
can compose lower dimensional representations (including the trivial 11 representation, 0) in
a direct sum to produce an alternative nn representation in eq. (72). however, such reducible
representations would yield tr[(i)2] which is less than that for the irreducible representation
(74). hence, for the reducible representations, one always nds

vn < vr  v0 = 0 .

20

(76)

hence these noncommutative congurations based on reducible representations would corre-
spond to intermediate unstable extrema of the potential (68), and it appears that the irre-
ducible representation describes the ground state of the system (and we refer to it as such in
the following).

given this ground state, one should note that since both terms in the equations of motion

involve commutators, one can still modify the solution by

i =

f
2

i

n + xi in

(77)

where in corresponds to the nn identity matrix. this modication corresponds to shifting
the center of mass of the d0-branes to

1
n

tr(i) = xi

(78)

and of course, the value of the potential remains unchanged as in eq. (75). for the purposes of
the following discussion we will assume that xi = 0 without loss of generality.11

geometrically, one can recognize the algebra (70) as that corresponding to the noncom-
mutative or fuzzy two-sphere [53, 54]. in the context of matrix theory, this noncommutative
geometry was discussed in ref. [55]. the extent of the noncommutative world-volume can be
measured as

r =   3xi=1

tr[(i)2]/n!1/2

= 2

sf ns1 

1
n2

(79)

for the ground state solution. for later convenience, we let us dene the radius r0  2
sf n,
which for large values of n gives essentially the physical size of the noncommutative geometry.
one may infer from the matrix model construction of kabat and taylor [55] that the non-
commutative solution actually represents a spherical d2-brane with n d0-branes bound to it.
while such a conguration carries no net d2-brane charge, there would be a dipole coupling
due to the seperation of oppositely oriented surface elements of membrane. the precise form
of this coupling can be calculated by substituting the noncommutative scalar solution (72) into
the world-volume interaction (67). using the ground state solution, the result can be written
as

r3
0

3g3

s (cid:18)1 

1

n2(cid:19)z dt f (4)

t123 .



(80)

in fact, this is only the leading source term that would be generated by substituting the non-
commutative solution into the full expansion in eq. (66)  that is, there will also be a series
of higher order multipole couplings, as well.

6.2 dual d2-branes

in the ground state solution above, the d0-branes condense out in a noncommutative con-
guration, which we argued represents a bound state of a spherical d2-brane and n d0-branes.
it is interesting to investigate to what extent these congurations can be matched in the dual
formulation of the same system. that is, an abelian three-dimensional world-volume theory of
a d2-brane in which a ux of the u(1) gauge eld strength represents the n bound d0-branes.

11if i is reducible, one may make similarly independent shifts for each of the irreducible representations in

the direct sum.

21

to parallel the same physics as above, we consider this test d2-brane system in a constant back-
ground rr four-form eld strength (65), and look for a stable static conguration resembling
that above.

to simplify the calculations, we write the at space metric using spherical polar coordinates

to replace x1,2,3, i.e.,

ds2 = dt2 + dr2 + r2(cid:16)d2 + sin2  d2(cid:17) +

9xi=4

(dxi)2 .

(81)

in static gauge, we choose the world-volume coordinates on the d2-brane to be 0 = t, 1 =
, 3 = . we will look for a static solution of the form

r = r

(82)

(and xi = 0 for i = 4, . . . , 9). the background four-form (65) should also be adapted to the
spherical polar coordinates

f (4)
tr = 2f r2 sin   c (3)

t =

2
3

f r3 sin 

(83)

where we have made a convenient gauge choice for three-form potential. the last ingredient
required before proceeding to the action is the u(1) eld strength describing the n bound
d0-branes,

f =

sin  .

(84)

n
2

one can conrm the normalization of this ux by considering the induced coupling to the rr
one-form in the chern-simons action (3). a simple calculation shows that

2z c (1) f = n0z dt c (1)

t

(85)

i.e., the (monopole) coupling to n fundamental d0-branes is reproduced.

with the above results in hand, we turn to the action which in the present case reduces to

s = t2z dt d dqdet(p [g]ab + fab) + 2z p [c (3)] .

(86)

note that for these calculations, we have a single d2-brane and so the world-volume theory is
abelian. eq. (86) xes the lagrangian density l, and so for the static trial solution (82), the
potential energy is given by

v (r) = z d d l
= 4t2sr4 +

2n2
4 

2f

2t0
2n

r4 + . . . 

4t0

r3

f r3 .

(87)

in the last line, we have expanded the square root for 2r2/n << 1, only keeping the rst two
terms in the expansion explicitly, and we have substituted t0 = 2t2 everywhere.

22

the rst thing that we note is that the constant term in the potential energy corresponds
precisely to the rest energy of n d0-branes. thus this precisely matches the same term in the
nonabelian d0-brane calculation in the previous section  this is the trivial constant term
in eq. (61), which was then overlooked in eq. (68). keeping only the leading order terms given
in eq. (87), there are two extrema:

a)

b

r = 0

r = r0 = 2

with v  nt0 = 0 ,
sf n with v  nt0 = 

23
sf 4
6g

(88)

n3 .

the rst extrema is an unstable inection point in the potential, while the second is a stable
spherical conguration. comparing the equilibrium radius with eq. (79), we see that this cal-
culation reproduces the noncommutative ground state radius up to 1/n2 corrections. similarly
the shift in the potential energy reproduces the result for the d0-brane result (75), again up to
1/n2 corrections.

finally, just as in the previous section, this spherical d2-brane conguration carries no net
d2-brane charge. however, because the membrane is supported at a nite radius, there is a
nite dipole coupling:

2z p [c (3)] = 

r3
0

3g3

s z dt f (4)

t123 + . . .

(89)

where we have only retained the leading term, and expressed the result in cartesian coordinates,
to compare to eq. (80). once again, the two calculations agree up to 1/n2 corrections. it would
be interesting to compare the higher order multipole couplings in the two dierent frameworks.

7 discussion

using t-duality, we have provided a straightforward construction of a nonabelian world-volume
action describing the dynamics of n dp-branes in general background elds. the action is
composed of two parts, the born-infeld action

sbi = tpz dp+1 str(cid:18)eqdet (p [eab + eai(q1  )ijejb] +  fab) det(qi

j)(cid:19) ,

with

e = g + b ,

and

qi

j  i

j + i [i, k] ekj ,

and the chern-simons action

scs = pz str(cid:16)p hei ii(x c (n) eb)i e f(cid:17) .

(90)

(91)

(92)

one of the most striking features of this result is that in the nonabelian action, dp-branes
couple to rr potentials with a form degree greater than the dimension of the world-volume.
these couplings arise through inner products with the nonabelian scalars, and vanish for the
abelian theory (3).

in both eqs. (90) and (92), the gauge trace is indicated with str(  ) to indicate its sym-
metrized nature. the precise prescription which we propose is that inside the trace one takes

23

a symmetrized average over all orderings of the fab, dai, i[i, j], and also the individual
i appearing in the functional dependence of the background elds. this trace prescription
was adopted from matrix theory, and was required to provide a precise agreement of the linear
background couplings for d0-branes derived from our action above, and those derived from ma-
trix theory [20]. this symmetrized trace coincides with tseytlins proposal for the nonabelian
born-infeld gauge theory, i.e., eq. (90) in at space. investigations of this proposal have shown
that it requires additional corrections involving commutators of eld strengths at sixth order
[39, 40]. however, for certain congurations, the at space born-infeld action seems to capture
the full physics of the nonabelian yang-mills elds [41, 42]. in any event, one should expect
that our nonabelian action will also require higher order commutator corrections in generic
situations. it would be of interest to determine the precise limitations of our action, or rather
to determine the situations where it does reliably describe the physics.

one limitation of our analyses is that we have considered only the bosonic elds. there
have been numerous investigations into constructing supersymmetric world-volume actions for
d-branes [56]. given these results, it would, of course, be interesting to extend the actions
constructed here to incorporate the interactions of the world-volume fermions. in this direction,
we note that the matrix theory construction of the linear background couplings for the d0-brane
[20] included the fermions, and so by t-duality, it can be used to extend these couplings to
arbitrary dp-branes [51].

since these world-volume actions, (90) and (92), are low energy string actions, there is an
innite series of higher order  interactions. the born-infeld term (90) already includes an
innite set of such interactions involving powers of fab, dai and i[i, j]. in the abelian theory,
the action (1) properly resums all the  corrections when the derivatives of the eld strength
and second derivatives of the scalars vanish [7]. one still expects further corrections involving
higher derivatives of the world-volume elds. for the nonabelian theory, the distinction between
derivatives and eld strengths becomes less clear, e.g., the higher order commutator corrections
[39], mentioned above, can be rewritten as higher derivative corrections. the results of ref. [42]
are an indication that the action (90) does properly resum the  corrections for constant
self-dual or supersymmetric eld strengths.

by introducing general background elds in either the abelian or nonabelian actions, one is
implicitly also including an innite series of higher order  corrections through the functional
dependence of these elds on the transverse directions, as illustrated in eq. (50). there are still
further higher derivative corrections involving the background elds that are independent of
the transverse elds [57, 58, 59]. the focus of most investigations in this direction have been on
anomalous curvature couplings appearing in the chern-simons action [58, 59]. these couplings
must also appear in the nonabelian action (92), but it would be interesting to determine their
precise form, in light of the commutator corrections discovered for the nonabelian scalars.

a further comment on these anomalous couplings is that it seems the interactions appearing
in the literature [58, 59] must be incomplete. recall that the guiding principle in construct-
ing eqs. (90) and (92) was that the actions should be consistent with t-duality. the known
anomalous curvature couplings [58, 59] only consider the curvature of the metric connection,
but since t-duality exchanges components of the metric and the neveu-schwarz two-form, these
couplings will not be compatible with t-duality. the consistent couplings will most likely in-
volve the generalized curvatures of a torsionful connection constructed by combining the metric

24

spin-connection and the neveu-schwarz three-form eld strength, e.g., [60]. recall that these
couplings arise from the anomalous transformation properties of the world-volume spinors. so
one piece of evidence in favor of generalized curvatures appearing in these interactions is that
such a torsion term appears in the full connection of the super-yang-mills fermions of the d9-
brane, e.g., [61]. this makes understanding the couplings of the world-volume fermions for
general dp-branes an even more interesting task.

before leaving our discussion of the action, (90) and (92), we remark again that the compar-
ison between this action and the matrix theory action in section 5 made a denite prediction
about that transverse ve-brane charges. that is, these elusive charges should be exactly zero,
i.e., m +ijklm = 0 = m ijklmn. one may note that this string theory prediction is in accord with
the arguments in ref. [45] that transverse ve-branes should not exist in the innite momentum
frame of matrix theory. on the other hand, an implicit matrix theory construction for trans-
verse ve-branes has been suggested using the s-duality of four-dimensional super-yang-mills
theory [62]. this is related to the observation that while d-branes have no obvious couplings to
b , the s-duality of type iib superstring theory interchanges d5-branes and ns5-branes.
hence the correct conclusion here seems to be that perturbatively m +ijklm and m ijklmn must
vanish, but that these couplings may be generated nonperturbatively at strong coupling.

given our nonabelian action, in section 6, we discussed the d-brane analog of the dielectric
eect. when dp-branes are placed in a nontrivial background eld for which the dp-branes
would normally be regarded as neutral, e.g., nontrivial f (n) with n > p + 2, new terms will be
induced in the scalar potential, and new noncommutative extrema can be generated. at such
a noncommutative extremum, the nontrivial expectation values of the scalars will cause the
dp-branes to act as a multipole source for new background elds. these ideas were explicitly
illustrated by considering a system of n d0-branes in a constant background rr eld f (4), and
it was shown the d0-branes expand into a noncommutative two-sphere, which carried a dipole
coupling for f (4).

one should note that there are similar couplings to the neveu-schwarz two-form implicit in

the born-infeld action. from the expansion of qdet(q), one nds an interaction of the form

hence the noncommutative ground state, in section 6.1 for which tr(cid:16)ijk(cid:17) 6= 0, also acts

as a source of the b eld with

r3

s (cid:18)1

(94)



this coupling is perhaps not so surprising, as the noncommutative ground state represents the
bound state of a spherical d2-brane and n d0-branes. explicit supergravity solutions describing
such bound states with a planar geometry are known [26, 63], and carry a long-range h eld
with the same prole as the rr eld strength f (4). one can also derive this coupling from the
dual d2-brane formulation used in section 6.2. furthermore, we observe that the presence of
this coupling (93) means that we would nd an analogous dielectric eect if the n d0-branes
were placed in a constant background h eld.

in section 6.2, we compared the results of the nonabelian d0-brane calculations to those
derived from an abelian d2-brane. the remarkable aspect of this comparison was the degree

25

i
3

2t0z dt tr(cid:16)ijk(cid:17) hijk(t) .

(93)

to which the results agreed, at least in the limit of large n. this agreement becomes even more
striking when we compare the full potential for the radial position. for the dual d2-brane, this
potential appears in the second line of eq. (87), and we rewrite it here as

v2(r) = nt0s1 +

4r4
2n2 

4f
3n

r3 .

to calculate the same for the d0-branes, we begin with the ansatz in eq. (70)

i = r i

n

(95)

(96)

where we will consider only the irreducible nn representation of the su(2) generators, but
we do not x r with the equations of motion (69). the corresponding physical radius of the
corresponding noncommutative two-sphere is given by

r2 =

2
n

3xi=1

tr[(i)2] = 2 r2(n2  1) .

(97)

now the born-infeld potential is determined by the determinant of the matrix q dened in
eq. (91), which in the present case becomes

det(qij) = det(cid:16)ij  2 r2ijkk
n(cid:17)

(i

n(cid:17) .

(98)

now we make two useful observations: first, the ordering of the matrices in the last two terms
of the determinant is ambiguous. however, in determining the potential, this expression will
appear inside the symmetrized trace, and so by the symmetric averaging there, the contributions
of these two terms will always cancel. hence, we can drop them in the following calculations.
the other observation is that the su(2) generators satisfy the relation

3xi=1

(i

n)2 = (n2  1) in ,

(99)

i.e., this is the quadratic casimir of the group. hence the two terms contributing in eq. (98)
are both proportional to the identity, and so the gauge trace simply yields an overall factor
of n. putting all of these results together, one nds that the full potential arising from the
nonabelian d0-brane action may be written

v0(r) = nt0(cid:18)1 

1

n2(cid:19)1/2s1

n2 +

4r4

(100)

one may conrm that if v0 is expanded for small 4r4/n2, one recovers precisely eq. (79) as
the position of the minimum. comparing the two potentials, (95) and (100), we now see that
there will be good agreement for the two calculations at large n using the entire potential, not
just with the leading order expansion used in section 6.

(101)

one way to understand this remarkable agreement is to consider the commutator of the
scalars expressed in terms of the physical radius (97). in terms of dimensionless matrices, the
commutator becomes

here we see that for xed r and s, the matrices become nearly commuting when n becomes
large. hence the nonabelian character of the solution diminishes and so it is not surprising that
the d0-brane results match those derived from the abelian d2-brane theory.

given the limitations of the nonabelian action discussed above, i.e., possible commutator
corrections at higher orders in f , one would conclude that the nonabelian d0-brane calculations
should only be trusted for small commutators. naively, one would expect that this would
translate into restricting the size of the noncommutative sphere to be small compared to the
string scale. the true restriction is that the taylor expansion of the square root in the potential
(100) converge rapidly, and this only requires that r << ns. hence for large n, one may
consider radii far larger than the string scale.

one may also argue that the radius must remain small since the low energy action, (90) and
(92), is simply inapplicable if the d0-branes become separated by more than the string scale.
that is, if the low energy modes have masses of the order of 1/s, then one could not ignore
oscillator excitations in determining the physics of the open string sector. while the latter
is true, the radius r is not the correct scale to characterize the separation of the d0-branes.
rather one should think of the d0-branes forming area elements of the noncommutative two-
sphere [54, 55]. the typical size of the area elements is 4r2/n, and so if as above r << ns,
the typical separations between d0-branes is still much less than the string scale, as required.
the latter result can be conrmed by considering the frequency of perturbations about the
extremum (79). one nds that 2 = n(n + 1)f 2 for large n where n is the angular quantum
number of the uctuation mode on the noncommutative sphere. now if r0 << ns then
f << 1/(ns). hence we see that the energy of the low energy excitations is far below the
string mass scale, and so will be adequately described by the low energy world-volume action.

being able to consider large r allows us to match onto the regime where the membrane
action of the dual d2-brane calculations is also applicable. of course, systems like the d2-
brane carrying a large gauge eld ux have recently been of interest for the connections to
noncommutative gauge theories, e.g., [64, 65]. following the analysis of ref. [64], one nds
that the regime upon which we focussed above is precisely that in which the standard string
coupling g is much smaller than the eective string coupling gs for the theory described in
terms of noncommutative variables, i.e.,

2r2
n

g

thus ordinary gauge theory provides the most ecient description of the d2-branes, i.e., the
system is essentially abelian. it would be interesting to try to study the system in a regime
where the noncommutative variables proved more ecient. ultimately, one expects the d2-
brane theory to give rise to the nonabelian d0-brane physics, but making the connection more
precise should prove illuminating.

still if the nonabelian d0- and abelian d2-brane calculations are simply dual formulations
of the same physical system, then for large but nite n, the d2-brane framework should still

27

capture the small but nite noncommutative properties found in the d0-brane calculations.
ref. [64] tells us that the dierence in formulating the d2-brane theory in terms of an ordinary
or noncommutative gauge theory is in the higher derivative corrections to the world-volume
action. so perhaps the noncommutative aspects of the bound state system will only appear in
the d2-brane formalism with the inclusion of certain higher derivative corrections to the abelian
action, (1) and (3). ordinarily such terms would be ignored on the basis that their contributions
give only small corrections, but in the present case, it is precisely small 1/n corrections that are
of interest. thus we are advocating that resolving the discrepancies between the dual pictures
requires determining corrections to both formalisms, e.g., higher order commutator corrections
for the d0-branes, and higher derivative corrections for the d2-branes.

finally, after arguing the merits of our calculations in section 6, we must still acknowledge
one signicant shortcoming  namely the supergravity background is not a consistent back-
ground solution of the type iia supergravity equations of motion. one could argue that this
background might be approximated by placing the d0-branes in the asymptotic region far from
a d2-brane, and focusing on a small region in which the gradients of the background elds can
be neglected. one can not take seriously all of the details of the calculations. for example,
the potentials (95) and (100) are in fact unstable since they are dominated by the r3 term at
large radius. however, this instability will only become apparent at radii of the order of 1/f ,
but the gravitational eects of the total energy of the four-form enclosed in such a region will
be of order 1. hence the gravitational back-reaction cannot be neglected on this scale, and so
we conclude that this instability is simply an artifact of not chosing a consistent solution for
the background.

however, the calculations in section 6 were presented in the spirit of a toy calculation to
illustrate the eects of the new nonabelian interactions appearing in the action, (90) and (92),
and in particular to demonstrate the dielectric eect for d-branes. a more detailed examination
of these issues for realistic backgrounds is in preparation [66].
