(3.8) considering static equation motion (3.3) (3.10) s =z d2 ("l(sol) + u2(sol)2!# k x2 2 (s )2 2 (cid:16)(cid:17)2 sol + o(3)) + , 1 (3.11) 4 l(sol) = 1 2 2 sol u(sol), prime means derivative respect . extremalizing action respect one obtain system equations partial derivatives eld uctuations: (cid:16)s1s (cid:17) + u2(sol) + solk x2 = o(2), (3.12) constraint removing redundant degree freedom. supposing (s, ) = k(s)f (), linear approximations k 1 (which naturally guarantees also smoothness world line 0) o(2) = 0 obtain system ordinary derivative equations ds dk ds 1 x2 1 x2 f + (u2(sol) c) f + + ck = 0, sol = 0, (3.13) (3.14) c constant separation. searching solution last equation form obtain homogeneous equation f = g + 1 c sol, g + sol c! g = 0. sol (3.15) (3.16) strictly speaking, explicit form g() signicant us, always suppose integration constants zero thus restricting special solution. nevertheless, homogeneous equation considered eigenvalue problem c (see below). substituting found function = kf back action (3.11), rewrite explicit p-brane form se = (class) e + (uct) e = z ds x2(cid:16) + k2(cid:17) , describing point particle curvature, dened (3.6), = 1 2 z f sol + 1 2 +z (f f ) d. further, static equation (3.3) obtain expression ( sol u1(sol)) sol = 0, rewritten 2 sol = 2u(sol()). 5 (3.17) (3.18) (3.19) (3.20) considering eqs. (3.5), (3.6), (3.15), (3.19) (3.20), expression written simple form = 2c + 1 2c2 +z u (sol()) d, (3.21) sol()| second term integrated full derivative, vanishes | o(1) innity. even happen, always include term surface terms action (3.11). thus, obtain nal form eective p-brane action theory straightforward derive corresponding equation motion frenet basis se = z ds x2(cid:18)1 + +(cid:18)c 1 x2 dk ds 1 2c k2(cid:19) . k2(cid:19) k = 0, 1 2 1 x2 ds hence one see eq. (3.13) nothing equation linear approximation k 1, expected. thus, problem yet demands resolving determination eigenvalue c. (3.16) provided chosen boundary conditions. one supposes, instance, niteness g innity c spectrum turns discrete. moreover, often happens c one two admissible values . case needed exact value c hence concrete case eq.

(4.11) function () = exp(cid:18) b 2 cosh (cid:19) sx=s c q(s )!

(4.17) hence, obtain ground-state mass quantum particle curvature coin- cides classical one, m0 = , (4.18) expected (strictly speaking, coincides sign insucient, see below). further, absence exact wave functions excited levels one nd rst (small) quantum correction mass approximation quantum harmonic oscillator. easy see b 1 (eective) potential 2(cid:19)2 v () =(cid:18)b sinh2 b 2 cosh 9 (4.19) single minimum vmin = b/2 min = 0. following h-expansion technique shift origin coordinates point minimum (to satisfy = 0 = 0 absence quantum oscillations), expand v taylor series second order near origin thus reducing model oscillator unit mass, energy /2 oscillation frequency = 1 2qb(b 1). therefore, quantization rules yield discrete spectrum =qb(b 1)(n + 1/2) + o(h2), n = 0, 1, 2, ..., (4.20) rst quantum correction particle masses determined lower energy oscillations: = 1 2qb(b 1) + o(h2), gives algebraic equation function . easily resolve approximation admissible major physical cases, obtain b 1 c/2 0, = b 2 + o(h2c/2), considering eqs. (4.13) (4.18) yields (m )2 = cm 4 + o(h2c/2). (4.21) (4.22) (4.23) (4.24) one seek mass form = + ( ), nally obtain mass particle curvature (3.22) rst-order quantum corrections (considering always dened sign, besides dened sign well) sign (m)m = q sign (m) c 2 + o(h2c/2), sign (m) chosen positive value = || q|c| 2 + o(h2c/2), (4.25) i. e., quantization procedure restores positivity mass. 10 nature justied choice root sign second term clear seems rst look, exist two interfering points view. apply formalism one-scalar 4 model  rst (physical) one is: compare result obtained ways , suppose sign + (or, least, rajaraman made mentions upon choice signs). however, second, mathematical, counterargument follows: known exact spectra operators qes potentials like (4.11) split, rule virtue radicals, hence signs might approximately represent bifurcation thus unharmed. really so, quantum uctuations divide classically unied particle curvature several subtypes respect mass. let us apply results case. one see indeed dened sign. therefore, considering eqs.
