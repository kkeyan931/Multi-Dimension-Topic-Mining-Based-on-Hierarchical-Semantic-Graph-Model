abstract

we show how the gauge symmetry representations of the massless particle
content of gauged supergravities that arise in the ads/cft correspondences
can be derived from symmetric subgroups to be carried by string theory vertex
operators in these compactied models, although an explicit vertex operator
construction of iib string and m theories on adsxs remains elusive. our sym-
metry mechanism parallels the construction of representations of the monster
group and ane algebras in terms of twisted conformal eld theories, and may
serve as a guide to the perturbative description of the iib string on adsxs.

1 introduction

recently gauged supergravities have become natural candidates for low-energy limits
of superstring and m theories on anti-de sitter space times a sphere (adsxs)[1, 2, 3, 4].
this was somewhat unexpected since conformal invariance of string theory implies
a vanishing tree level cosmological constant for the higher-dimensional theory. al-
though sigma model descriptions have been found[5], the precise formulation of these
theories via vertex operators, i.e. primary elds, has remained elusive[6].
in this
paper, we assign representations of a symmetric subalgebra of the gauge symmetry
of the supergravity to left and right-moving vertex operators, and show that the
full gauge group representations are then regained by inverse branching rules. this
mechanism is similar to the construction of ane algebras and representations of the
monster group as twisted conformal eld theories[7, 8, 9]. the vertex operators asso-
ciated with the gauge bosons in the supergravity multiplet thus include both bosonic
and fermionic emission operators. our identication of the subgroups may serve as
a guide in the explicit construction of these vertex operators, and the subsequent
description of iib on adsxs as a perturbative string theory.

in sect.s 2-4, we compute symmetric subgroups for the three examples that
have maximal supersymmetry. each corresponds to a collection of p-branes whose
near horizon geometry looks like adsp+2  s dp2, where d = 10 or 11 for branes in
string or m-theory, and p = 2, 3, 5. the formulation of vertex operators and string
theory tree amplitudes on ads5 will allow access to the dual conformal su(n) gauge
eld theory cf t4 at large n, but small xed t hooft coupling x = g2
y m n in the dual
correspondence, as (g2
sph/. presently only the large n, and large
xed t hooft coupling x limit is accessible in the cft, since only the supergravity
limit (  0) of the ads theory is known[10]. in sect. 5 we discuss a case with
non-maximal supersymmetry.

2 iib superstring on ads5  s5

for p = 3, a set of d3-branes in type iib superstring theory has near horizon geometry
ads5  s5. the low-energy limit is d = 5, n = 8 gauged supergravity [11, 12, 13]
and the physical massless states belong to the supermultiplet with (1; 4 + 4; 15 + 6 +
6; 4 + 4 + 20 + 20; 20r + 10 + 10 + 1 + 1) representations of the gauge group su(4).
the last set of representations correspond to the 42 scalars which parameterize the
coset space e6,6/sp4.

the ungauged d = 5, n = 8 supergravity (corresponding to the low enery limit
of the iib superstring on minkowski5  t 5) has the same number of physical states
as the gauged version, but with light-cone little group spin(3) and particle content

1

(5, 8 4, 27 3, 48 2, 42 1) derived below. (spin(3) representations are underlined). unlike
the gauged version, this theory can be easily constructed from vertex operators given
in terms of free worldsheet boson and fermion fock space operators. working in the
neveu-schwarz ramond formalism in light-cone gauge, we nd the massless sector
as follows. the left and right-moving modes are each taken to be described by eight
bosonic and eight fermionic worldsheet elds
[14, 15]. both left and right-moving
fermionic (neveu-schwarz(ns)) elds are in the 3 + 5 1 representation of spin(3).
spin elds, corresponding to massless ramond (r) states, transform as 4 2 of spin(3)
on each side. the (left x right) massless states of d = 5, n = 8 are given by:
ns-ns (3 + 5 1)  (3 + 5 1) = 5 + 11 3 + 26 1;
r-r
ns-r (3 + 5 1)  4 2 = 4 4 + 24 2
r-ns (3 + 5 1)  4 2 = 4 4 + 24 2.

4 2  4 2 = 16 (3 + 1)

for the gauged version, the construction of vertex operators for the underlying
type iib string theory on ads5  s5 remains obscure, but as in superstring theory
on at space, it seems reasonable that the physical string states in this maximally
symmetric theory on anti-de sitter space are also in one-to-one correspondence with
vertex operators. we show that if vertex operators with the same number of spin
degrees of freedom as in the at space case, are in the following representations of
su(2)2  u(1), a symmetric subgroup of the gauge group su(4), then the resulting
closed string massless states can be identied with table 1.

the procedure is thus to identify the left and right-moving modes as certain
representations of a symmetric subgroup of the supergravity gauge group. there will
be massless gauge bosons from both the ns-ns and the r-r sectors. gauge bosons
corresponding to the adjoint represention of the symmetric subgroup are in the ns-ns
sector. the r-r bosons carry a representation of the subgroup, and together with the
ns-ns bosons they enhance the symmetry to the adjoint representation of the full
gauge group. this mechanism is familiar from conformal eld theory constructions of
twisted ane algebras and the monster group [7, 8, 9]. the bosons from the twisted
(ramond) sector form part of the non-abelian multiplet.

a symmetric subgroup has the property that its structure constants can be
written as fabc = {fabc, faij , otherwise 0}, for 1  a  dimension of the gauge
group, 1  a  dimension of the subgroup, and a = {a, i}. see for eg. ref [16]. the
fact that the subgroup we choose is a symmetric subgroup, where a labels states in
the ns sectors and i states in the ramond sectors, leads to a correlation between
allowed trilinear string state couplings (ie ns-ns-ns, or ns-r-r, but not ns-ns-r
nor r-r-r) and the gauge couplings (fabc or faij non-zero, but fabi = fij k = 0).
this feature holds for our three examples.

note that although there is the same number of physical degrees of freedom in
the massless sector of the ungauged and gauged models, the light-cone little group

2

analysis is dierent, and the elimination of non-physical degrees of freedom proceeds
dierently in the two cases [17, 12, 18, 19]. nonetheless, for convenience in the tables,
we list the gauged supergravity states by their spin, i.e. what would be the light-
cone little group representation in the ungauged version. the ads vertex operators
carrying these quantum numbers would thus be in light-cone gauge and describe
physical degrees of freedom. they would be in one to one correspondence with hilbert
space states given by unitary short representations of the supergroup su(2, 2/4), and
with the non-physical degrees freedom subtracted out. the supergroup for this model,
su(2, 2/4), has 30 even generators in the subgroup su(2, 2)  su(4), and 32 odd
generators. the even subgroup is the isometries of ads5 and s5 respectively, where
the algebras su(2, 2)  so(2, 4) and su(4)  so(6).

for the type iib superstring on ads5s5, we assign the following su(2)2u(1)
representations to the left and right-moving ns modes and spin elds (the numbers
in the (,) brackets are the su(2)2 representations, the subscripts are u(1) helicity,
and the d = 5 multiplicity appears underlined preceeding each bracket):

ns (left) 3 (1, 1)0,
ns (right) 3 (1, 1)0,
ramond (left) 2 ((2, 1)1 + (2, 1)1)
ramond (right) 2 ((1, 2)1 + (1, 2)1).

1 ((3, 1)0 + (1, 1)2 + (1, 1)2)
1 ((1, 3)0 + (1, 1)2 + (1, 1)2)

taking the left  right tensor products of these su(2)2 representations for the
ns-ns, r-r, ns-r, r-ns sectors, we then reproduce the values in the last column
of table 1. since these representations are precisely those in the branching rules of
the su(4) representations in the second column, we conjecture that vertex operators
carrying such quantum numbers will reproduce the string theory with d = 5, n = 8,
su(4) gauged supergravity. although at this time a vertex operator construction for
the type iib superstring on ads5s5 is not known, it seems likely that the theory has
a perturbative conformal eld theory description and therefore that the string states
including the low-energy supergravity elds will have a vertex operator description.
our analysis presents the representation theory content for such operators.

3 m-theory on ads4  s7
for p = 2, a set of m2-branes in m-theory has near horizon geometry ads4  s7.
the low-energy limit is d = 4, n = 8 gauged supergravity [20, 21, 22] and the
massless states have physical degrees of freedom given by the familiar supermultiplet
with (1; 8s; 28; 56s; 35v + 35c) representations of the gauge group so(8). here the
last set of representations corresponds to the 70 scalars which parameterize the coset
space e7,7/su(8). the supergroup is osp(8/4) which has 38 even generators in the

we assign the following su(2)4 representations to the left and right-moving ns

labels the spin(2) as in the rst column of table 2:

ns (left) (1) (1,1,1,1),

computing the left  right tensor products of these su(2)4 representations for
the ns-ns, r-r, ns-r, r-ns sectors, we reproduce the values in the last column
of table 2, and conjecture that vertex operators in light-cone gauge carrying such
quantum numbers will be useful in contructing string theory with d = 4, n = 8,
so(8) gauged supergravity as its low-energy limit [23].

4 m-theory on ads7  s4

for p = 5, a set of 5-branes in m-theory has near horizon geometry ads7  s4.
the low-energy limit is d = 7, n = 4 gauged supergravity [24, 25, 26, 27] and the
massless supergravity multiplet has (1; 4; 5; 10; 16; 14) representations of the gauge
group so(5). the 14 scalars parameterize the coset space sl(5, r)/so(5). the

supergroup is osp(2, 6/4) which has 38 even generators in the subgroup so(2, 6) 
so(5), and 32 odd generators. this is the simplest of our three examples. we choose
the su(2)2 symmetric subalgebra of so(5) as listed in table 4 and assign the following
su(2)2 representations to the left and right-moving ns modes and spin elds:

ns (left) 5 (1,1), 1 (3,1)
ns (right) 5 (1,1), 1 (1,3)
ramond (left) 4 (2,1)
ramond (right) 4 (1,2).

the tensor products of the su(2)2 representations which then result in the ns-
ns, r-r, ns-r, r-ns sectors are computed in the last column of table 3. these
representations are those which occur in the branching rules for so(5)  su(2)2 and
give the representations in the second column that are found in the d = 7, n = 8
so(5) gauged supergravity multiplet. the properties of the structure constants in a
symmetric subalgebra ensure that gauge couplings of the states are consistent with
string tree amplitudes for ns and ramond states.

5 iib superstring on ads3  s3

finally, we consider the non-maximally supersymmetric case of the iib string on
ads3  s3  m 4, where m 4 is either t 4 or k3 [6, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35]. the

supergroup for this model is su(2/1, 1)  su(2/1, 1), which has 12 even generators
in the subgroup su(1, 1)  su(1, 1)  so(4), and 16 odd generators. su(1, 1)2 is the
isometry group of ads3 and so(4) that of s3. the low-energy limit is d = 3, n = 8,
so(4) gauged supergravity. in three dimensions the graviton and gravitinos do not
have physical degrees of freedom, and the physical spectrum consists of n copies of
eight bosons and eight fermions in representations of the gauge group so(4) given
by n ((2, 2) + 4(1, 1); 2(1, 2) + 2(2, 1)), where n = 5 for m 4 = t 4 and n = 21 for
m 4 = k3.

because both ads3 and s3 are group manifolds, a vertex operator construction
is straightforward in this theory. ads3 corresponds to the su(1, 1) manifold, and s3
is the su(2) manifold. the gauge symmetry algebra so(4)  su(2)2 thus appears
explicitly as left and right worldsheet su(2) currents, and in this ads3 case there
is no symmetric subalgebra construction. that is to say, the vertex operators carry
quantum numbers of the full gauge symmetry group, even before taking the left times
right tensor products. so no new gauge symmetry generators appear in the ramond
sector in this non-maximally supersymmetric example, in contrast to our suggestion
for the maximally symmetric cases discussed in sect.s 2-4.

6

6 conclusions

in the three maximally symmetric examples of the ads/cft correspondence, we
have analyzed the representations of the gauged supergravities in terms of symmetric
subalgebras. although each of the gauge algebras in our models, ie. su(4)  so(6),
so(8) and so(5)  sp2, has several symmetric subalgebras, we identify a particular one
(for each case) that appears to have a natural role in terms of the quantum numbers
of left and right-moving vertex operators. in the case of ads5 (su(4)), our symmetric
subgroup su(2)  su(2)  u(1) coincides with the subgroup with respect to which
su(4) has jordan structure used [13, 36] in the oscillator method to construct unitary
irreducible representations of the ads theory. a direct connection between this latter
construction and a vertex operator construction, however, is not apparent.

the enhancement of gauge symmetry from the subalgebra that occurs as a
current algebra in each sector is familiar from the conformal eld theory construction
of ane algebras and sporadic groups by twisted i.e. orbifold-like conformal eld
theories. for example, for an e8 ane algebra, the untwisted and twisted sectors
each carry a representation of the subgroup so(16), but together the two sectors can
be combined by an inverse branching ratio to form e8 representations, with some of
the states in the adjoint representation of e8 coming from the twisted sector. in this
case, the currents will consist of both superelds and spin elds.
