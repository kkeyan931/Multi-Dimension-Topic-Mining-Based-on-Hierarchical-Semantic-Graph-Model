abstract

new clues for the best understanding of the nature of the symmetry-breaking
mechanism are revealed in this paper. a revision of the standard gauge transfor-
mation properties of yang-mills elds, according to a group approach to quanti-
zation scheme, enables the gauge group coordinates to acquire dynamical content
outside the null mass shell. the corresponding extra (internal) eld degrees of
freedom are transferred to the vector potentials to conform massive vector bosons.

1 introduction

despite the undoubted success of the standard model in describing strong and electro-
weak interactions, a real (versus articial) mechanism of mass-generation is still lacking.
needless to say that the discovery of a higgs boson a quantum vibration of an abnor-
mal (higgs) vacuum would be of enormous importance; nevertheless, at present, no
dynamical basis for the higgs mechanism exists, and it is purely phenomenological. it is
true that there is actually nothing inherently unreasonable in the idea that the state of

work partially supported by the dgicyt.

minimum energy |0i (the vacuum) may be one in which some eld quantity (x) has a
non-zero expectation value h0| (x)|0i = 0; in fact, many examples in condensed-matter
physics display this feature. nevertheless, it remains conjectural whether something sim-
ilar actually happens in the weak interaction case.

also, the ad hoc introduction of extra (higgs) scalar elds in the theory to provide mass
to the vector bosons could be seen as our modern equivalent of those earlier mechanical
contrivances populating the plenum (the ether), albeit very subtly. as in those days, new
perspectives are necessary to explain why it is really not indispensable to look at things
this way at all.

this paper provides a new approach to quantum yang-mills theories, from a group-
theoretic perspective, in which mass enters the theory in a natural way; more precisely,
the presence of mass will manifest through non-trivial transformations of the phase  =
ei of the wave functional (a) under the action of gauge transformations. this non-
trivial response of the phase under gauge transformations causes a deformation of the
corresponding lie-algebra commutators and leads to the appearance of central terms
proportional to mass parameters and, consequently, to a quantum generation of extra
(internal) eld degrees of freedom according to a self-interacting theory of massless and
massive vector bosons (without higgs elds).

this cohomological mechanism of mass-generation makes perfect sense from a group
approach to quantization (gaq [1]) framework, and we shall use its concepts and tools
to work out the quantization of yang-mills theories. given that this is not a common
approach to quantization, we shall give useful references and try to be as self-contained
as possible. quantizing on a group, however, will require the revision of some standard
concepts, such as gauge transformations, in order to deal with them properly. the meaning
of gauge transformations in quantum mechanics is not well understood at present (see,
for example, [6]); thus, a re-examination of it is timely.

gauge symmetry is always a guarantee for the renormalizability of a eld theory. the
introduction of mass usually spoils gauge invariance, but the higgs mechanism manages
to preserve renormalizability by keeping gauge invariance in a hidden way, and this is the
main novelty in comparison with other attempts to supply mass. however, we must say
that the breakdown of a gauge symmetry and the appearance of anomalous (unexpected)
situations are sometimes subtle questions which generally go with the standard approach
of quantizing classical systems. from a group-theoretic framework, any consistent (non-
perturbative) quantization is just a unitary irreducible representation of a suitable (lie,
poisson) algebra. this approach does not assume the existence of a previous classical
underlying system and overcomes some of the standard failures in quantization (anoma-
lies) attached to canonical quantization, reinterpreting them as normal (even essential)
situations.

a unied quantization of massless and massive non-abelian vector bosons will be
presented in sections 3 and 4, respectively. the abelian case (electromagnetic and proca
elds) is briey discussed in sec. 1. the hilbert space of the theory is related to the carrier
space of the unitary irreducible representations of an innite-dimensional quantizing group
g, the mass eventually being a parameter characterizing the representation. section 4 is

2

devoted to the incorporation of fermionic matter into the theory.

2 the abelian case

in a previous article [7], a revision of the traditional concept of gauge transformation for
the electromagnetic vector potential,

(x)  (x) + (x), a(x)  a(x)  (x) ,

(1)

was necessary to arrange this transformation inside a group law that is, to adapt this
operation to an action of a group on itself: the group law of the (innite-dimensional)
electromagnetic quantizing group g. the proposed lie group g had a principal bundle
structure g  g/ t and was parameterized, roughly speaking, by the coordinates a(~x, t)
of the abelian subgroup ga of lie algebra valued vector potentials, the coordinates v =
(y, ) (space-time translations and lorentz transformations) of the poincare group
p and the coordinates (~x, t) of the local group t  u(1)(~x, t), which took part of
the structure group t  t  u(1) and generalized the standard u(1)-phase invariance,
  ei, in quantum mechanics. in this way, the extra t -equivariance conditions on
wave functions [complex valued functions (g) on g], i.e. (gt  g)  (g), gt  t ,
provided the traditional constraints of the theory.

the abovementioned revision was motivated by the fact that the transformation (1)
is not compatible with a group law. indeed, the general property g  e = e  g = g for a
composition law g = g  g of a group g (e denotes the identity element), precludes the
existence of linear terms, in the group law gj = gj(gk, gl) of a given parameter gj of g,
other than gj and gj; that is, near the identity we have gj = gj + gj + o(2). therefore,
the group law for the eld parameter a cannot have linear terms in . the natural way
to address this situation is to leave the vector potential unchanged, and change the phase
 = ei of the quantum-mechanical wave functional (a) as follows:

(x)  (x) + (x), a(x)  a(x),

where  denotes the minkowski metric,  denotes a spatial hypersurface and h is the
a  a 
planck constant, which is required to kill the dimensions of 

a and gives a quantum character to the transformation (2) versus the classical
a
character of (1) [hereafter, we shall use natural unities h = 1 = c]. the piece

space-time] which is conserved, j  = 0, if a and  satisfy the eld equations ( +
m2)a = 0 and ( + m2) = 0 (m is a parameter with mass dimension), so that the
integral in (2) does not depend on the chosen space-like hypersurface . the integral

(g|g) r d(x)j (g|g)(x) is a two-cocycle  : g  g   [g denotes the semi-direct

product (ga  t ) v p ], which fuls the well-known properties:

(g|g) + (g  g|g) = (g|g  g) + (g|g) , g, g, g  g ,

(g|e) = 0 = (e|g) , g  g ,

and is the basic ingredient to construct the centrally extended group law g = g  g, more
explicitly

g, g, g  g; ,  ,    u(1) ,

(5)

of the electromagnetic quantizing group g (see below and ref. [7] for more details).

it bears mentioning that the required revision of the concepts of gauge transformations
and constraint conditions to construct the quantizing group g has led, as a byproduct, to
a unied quantization of both the electromagnetic and proca elds [7], within the same
general scheme of quantization based on a group (gaq) [1]. the dierent structure of
the central extension (5) for the massive case, with regard the massless case, manifests
itself through a true (non-trivial) central-extension t of the constraint subgroup t by
u(1) given by the peace

of the cocycle (g|g) r dj (g|g). the piece m, which is one (3) of the three typical

and distinguishable pieces (j, j = 1, 2, 3) in which  splits up (see [7, 9] and bellow), gives
dynamics to the local group t (creates new couples of canonically-conjugated variables),
and makes the constraints of second-class nature. this results in an increased number of
eld degrees of freedom with regard the massless case, leading to a proca quantum eld
(see [7] for more details).

furthermore, the standard (classical) transformation (1) is regained as the trajecto-
ries associated with generalized equations of motion generated by vector elds with null
noether invariants (gauge subalgebra, see refs.
[7, 8] and [9] for a formal exposition,
including tensor elds).

a unied scheme of quantization for non-abelian massless and massive vector bosons
is also possible in this scheme and suitable as an alternative to the standard spontaneous
symmetry breaking mechanism, which is intended to supply mass while preserving renor-
malizability. however, for this case, the situation seems to be a bit more subtle and far
richer.

3 group-quantization of yang-mills fields

according to the headings in the foregoing section, our main purpose now is to oer
a reasonable attempt to nd a (non-perturbative) unied quantization of non-abelian

4

massless and massive vector bosons without higgs elds. as in the abelian case, the key
to achieve this goal consists in a revision of the traditional concept of gauge transformation
for vector potentials,

u(x)  u (x)u(x) , a(x)  u (x)a(x)u (x)1 + u (x)u (x)1,

(7)

in order to make it compatible with a group law: the group law of the (innite-dimensional)
yang-mills quantizing group g, which will be the primary object to dene the quantum
theory. this group has a bre-bundle structure g  g/ t and is parametrized, roughly
speaking, by the coordinates a(x) = rb
b (x)t a of an abelian subgroup ga of lie alge-
bra valued vector potentials [rb
a is a coupling-constant matrix and t a are the lie-algebra
generators of the rigid subgroup t, of a gauge group t , satisfying the commutation re-
lations [t a, t b] = c ab
c ] and the coordinates
u(x) = ea(x)t a  e(x) of the local group t , which takes part of the structure subgroup
t  t  u(1) and generalizes the standard u(1)-phase invariance   ei in quantum
mechanics as a particular case of t -equivariance condition [2]

on complex wave functionals  : g  c dened on g, where d()
symbolizes a specic
t
representation d of t with -index (in particular, the  = -angle [10] of non-abelian
gauge theories; see below). as already commented, the t -equivariance conditions (8) pro-
vide the traditional constraints of the theory, which will be rst- or second-class depending
on whether the fribration of the structure subgroup t  t /u(1) by u(1) is trivial or not
(m = 0 or m 6= 0, respectively; see below).

as mentioned above in the abelian case, the transformation (7) is not compatible with
a group law. the natural way to adapt the operation (7) to an action of a group on itself
is to consider that a transforms homogeneously under the adjoint action of t , whereas
the non-tensorial part u(x)u (x)1 modies the phase  = ei of the wave functional
(a) according to:

u(x)  u (x)u(x) , a(x)  u (x)a(x)u (x)1 ,

(9)

we are restricting ourselves, for the sake of simplicity, to gauge groups t associated with
rigid special unitary groups t for which the structure constants c ab
c are totally anti-
symmetric, and the anti-hermitian generators t a can be chosen such that the killing-
cartan metric is just tr(t at b) =  1
2ab. for simple groups, the coupling-constant matrix
rb
a reduces to a multiple of the identity rb
r tr(t aa). the
argument of the exponential in (9) can be considered to be a piece of a two-cocycle
 : g  g   (g is the semi-direct product g = ga u t of t and the abelian
group ga of lie-algebra valued potentials) constructed through a conserved current,

(g|g) =r d(x)j (g|g)(x), g, g  g, so that it does not depend on the chosen space-

like hypersurface  (see [8, 9]). on this basis, let us construct a central extension g of g

a, and we have a

a =  2

a = rb

by making use of a two-cocycle dened on the particular t = constant -hypersurface. we
shall also make partial use of the gauge freedom to set the temporal component a0 = 0,
so that the electric eld is simply ea =  aa [from now on, and for the sake of sim-
j=1 ajej, in the
hope that no confusion will arise]. in this case, there is still a residual gauge invariance
t = map(3, t) (see [11]).

plicity, we shall put any three-vector a as a, and understand ae = p3

the explicit group law g = g  g [with g = (g; ) = (a, e, u; )] for the proposed

innite-dimensional yang-mills quantizing group g is:

u (x) = u (x)u(x) ,
a(x) = a(x) + u (x)a(x)u (x)1 ,
e(x) = e(x) + u (x)e(x)u (x)1 ,

we have split up the two-cocycle  into three signicantly distinguishable two-cocycles
j, j = 1, 2, 3 (as in [7, 9]) for a much better understanding. the rst two-cocycle 1 is
meant to provide dynamics to the vector potential, so that the couple (a, e) corresponds
to a canonically-conjugate pair of coordinates. the second two-cocycle 2, the mixed
two-cocycle, provides a non-trivial (non-diagonal) action of the structure subgroup t on
vector potentials and determines the number of degrees of freedom of the constrained
theory; it is the non-covariant analogue of the argument of the exponential in (9). both
cocycles correspond to the analogous ones of the abelian case. concerning the third one,
3  , its origin and nature departs essentially from the abelian analogue (6). unlike
the abelian case t = u(1)(x), the semi-simple character of t precludes a true central
extension t of t = map(3, t) by u(1) (this is not the case in one compact spatial
dimension 3  s1, where true central extensions are known for kac-moody groups).
however, there exists certain coboundaries, called pseudo-cocycles, which dene trivial
extensions as such, but provide new commutation relations in the lie algebra of g and
provide a non-trivial piece of the connection form of the theory [1],

gj (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)g=e

thus altering, in particular, the number of degrees of freedom of the theory (see [4] for a
relationship between pseudo-cohomology and coadjoint orbits of semisimple groups). this
is precisely the case of the third cocycle (coboundary, indeed), 3(g|g) = (g  g) 

(g)  (g), generated by a function (g) = 2r d3x tr [ log u] with non-trivial gradient

(g)|g=e = (g)
gj 6= 0 at the identity g = e, which is locally linear in the parameters
of the cartan subgroup with as many independent coecients (constants) a as elements
in the cartan subalgebra, i.e. the range of the rigid group t. the introduction of such
a pseudo-cocycle is needed to obtain a faithful representation of the rigid subgroup t,
according to our general group representation approach. pseudo-cocycles similar to 3 do
appear in the representation of kac-moody groups and in conformally invariant theories in
general, although the pseudo-cocycle parameters are usually hidden in a redenition of the
generators involved in the pseudo-extension (the argument of the lie-algebra generating
function). this is the case of the virasoro algebra in string theory,

[ ln, lm] = (n  m) ln+m + 1/12(cn3  cn)n,m1 ,

(12)

where the l0 generator is redened so as to produce a non-trivial expectation value in
the vacuum, h  (c  c)/24 [5].

the cocycle 3, however, for  6= 0, again determines the structure of constraints (rst-
or second-class) and modies the dynamical content of the vector potential coordinates a
by transferring degrees of freedom between the a and  coordinates. as in the abelian
case, this mechanism conforms massive vector bosons so that 3 must be considered as
a mass cocycle. in this way, the appearance of mass in the theory has a cohomological
origin. notice that the parameter  (a) bears the dimensions of cubed mass (in natural
unities) and can well be renamed by m3 (m3

a) .

to make more explicit the intrinsic signicance of these three quantities j , j = 1, 2, 3,
let us calculate the non-trivial lie-algebra commutators of the right-invariant vector elds
(that is, the generators of the left-action lg(g) = g  g of g on itself) from the group law
(10). they are explicitly:

c (x  y) x r

 = i x r

where we denote by   i x l
 the central generator, in order to distinguish it from
the rest, in view of its crucial role in the quantization procedure; it behaves as i times the
identity operator, (g) = i(g), when the u(1) part of the t -equivariance conditions
(8), d()
t () =  (always faithful, except in the classical limit u(1)   [1]), is imposed.
the commutators (13) agree with those of ref. [11] when c = 0 and the identication

the identity element g = e of g, which motivates this particular identication]. from
the last line of (13) we realize that the pseudo-cocycle 3 introduces new central terms
proportional to the mass parameters c = m3
c, with respect to the massless case, which
provide new canonically conjugated coordinates; that is, extra degrees of freedom enter
the theory through this pseudo-extension, which provides dynamics to the local (gauge)
coordinates a of the structure subgroup t , dynamics which is transferred to the vector
potentials aa to conform massive vector bosons.

to understand fully the last statement concerning the interplay among dierent cocy-
cles and mainly between the massless and massive cases, we must construct the hilbert
space of both theories explicitly. let us proceed with the massless case and leave the
peculiarities of the massive one to the next section.

the representation lg(g) = (g  g) of g on t -equivariant wave functions (8)
proves to be reducible. the reduction can be achieved by means of those right conditions
(polarization conditions [1]) rgp(g) = (g  gp)  (g) g  g compatible with
the t -equivariant conditions (8), in particular with  = i. in general, polarization
conditions contain nite right-transformations generated by left-invariant vector elds
x l devoid of dynamical content (that is, without a canonically conjugated counterpart),
and half of the left-invariant vector elds related to dynamical coordinates (either po-
sitions or momenta). the left-invariant vector elds without canonically conjugated
counterpart are the combinations

tensor for yang-mills theories are linear combinations of operators in (24); for example,

00(x) =  trh e2(x) + b2(x)i is the hamiltonian density. in this way, poincare invari-

ance is retrieved in the constrained theory. at this stage, it is worth mentioning that gc
would have included the entire poincare algebra had we incorporated the poincare group
into g (see [7, 9] for the abelian case). however, unlike other standard approaches to
quantum mechanics, gaq still remainss even in the absence of a well-dened (space-
)time evolution, an interesting and desirable property concerning the quantization of
gravity (see, for example, [13]).

let us mention, for the sake of completeness, that the actual use of good operators is
not restricted to rst- and second-order operators. higher-order operators can constitute
a useful tool in nding the whole constrained hilbert space hphys( g).
in fact, it can
be obtained from a t -equivariant (physical) state (0), i.e. ga(0) = 0, on which the
energy-momentum tensor has null expectation value h(0)| |(0)i = 0, by taking the
orbit of the rest of good operators passing through this vacuum. this has indeed been
a rather standard technique (the verma module approach) in theories where null vector
states are present in the original hilbert space [14, 15, 5]. from another point of view,

with regard to connement, exponentials of the form 2  trhexp(jklr2 djk el)i and

10

2  trhexp(jklr2 djk bl)i, where 2 is a two-dimensional surface in three-dimensional

space, are good operators related to wilson loops.

as a step prior to tackling the massive case, let us show how new physics can enter
t of t or, in an equivalent way,

the theory by considering non-trivial representations d()
by introducing certain extra pseudo-cocycles in the group law (10).

3.1 -angle

more general representations for the constraint subgroup t , namely the one-dimensional
representation d()
t (u) = eiu , can be considered if we impose additional boundary con-
ditions such as u(x) x i; this means that we compactify the space 3  s3, so
that the group t falls into disjoint homotopy classes {ul , ul
= l} labeled by integers
l  z = 3(t) (the third homotopy group). the index  (the -angle [10]) parametrizes
non-equivalent quantizations, in the same way that bloch momentum  does for particles
in periodic potentials, where the wave function acquires a phase (q + 2) = ei(q) after
a translation of, let us say, 2. the phenomenon of non-equivalent quantizations can
also be reproduced by keeping the constraint condition d()
t (u) = 1, as in (18,22), at the
expense of introducing a new cocycle (indeed a coboundary)  which is added to the

previous cocycle  in (10). the generating function of  is (g) = r d3x c0(x), where

c0 is the time component of the chern-simons secondary characteristic class

c =

162 tr(fa 

2

aaa) ,

(25)

which is the vector whose divergence equals the pontryagin density p = c =  1
162 tr
(f f) (see [11], for instance). like some total derivatives (namely, the pontryagin
density), which do not modify the classical equations of motion when added to the la-
grangian but have a non-trivial eect in the quantum theory, the coboundary  gives rise
to non-equivalent quantizations parametrized by  when the topology of the space is af-
fected by the imposition of certain boundary conditions (compactication of the space),
even though it is a trivial cocycle of the unconstrained theory. the phenomenon of
non-equivalent quantizations can sometimes also be understood as an aharonov-bohm-
like eect (an eect experienced by the quantum particle but not by the classical one)
and the gradient d(g) can also be understood as an induced gauge connection (see [3]
for the example of a superconducting ring threaded by a magnetic ux) which modies
momenta according to the minimal coupling. for our case, the induced gauge connec-
tion (g) = r2
is the magnetic eld) modies the momentum operators
ea  i x r

as already discussed, only coboundaries generated by functions (g) with non-trivial
gradient (g)|g=e 6= 0 at the identity g = e (i.e. pseudo-cocycles), namely 3 = , will

11

provide a contribution to the connection form of the theory (11) and the structure con-
stants of the original lie algebra. however, as we have just seen, a coboundary generated
by a global function on the original (innite-dimensional) group g having trivial gradi-
ent at the identity, namely , can contribute the quantization with global (topological)
eects as the new group has a non-equivalent global multiplication law.

in both cases, non-trivial gauge transformation properties, d()

t (u) 6= 1, of the wave
functional (a) can be reproduced, as already mentioned, by keeping the trivial represen-
tation d()
t (u) = 1 at the expense of introducing new (pseudo-) cocycles,  or , in the
centrally extended group law (10). however, whereas  does not introduce new degrees
of freedom into the theory, pseudo-cocycles such as  provide new couples of canonically
conjugated eld operators, thus substantially modifying the theory. let us examine this
in more detail.

the eect of the pseudo-cocycle 3   for  6= 0 is equivalent to inducing internal
(spinor-like) innite-dimensional non-abelian representations d()
t of t . it modies the
commutation relations (13) and the number of eld degrees of freedom of the theory by
restricting the number of vector elds in the characteristic subalgebra gc with respect
to the massless case, where gc  t . that is, new couples of generators ( x r
b),
with c ab
c c 6= 0, become canonically conjugated [see the last commutator of (13)] and,
therefore, new basic operators enter the theory. to count the number of eld degrees
of freedom for a given structure subgroup t and a given mass matrix  = at a, let
us denote by  = dim(t) and c = dim(gc) the dimensions of the rigid subgroups of
t and gc; in general, for an arbitrary mass matrix , we have c   . unpolarized,
u(1)-equivariant functions (aj
a, a) depend on n = 2  3 +  eld coordinates in
d = 3 dimensions; polarization equations introduce p = c + nc
independent restrictions

on wave functions, corresponding to c non-dynamical coordinates in gc and half of the
dynamical ones; nally, constraints impose q = c +  c
2 additional restrictions which leave
f = n  p  q = 3  c eld degrees of freedom (in d = 3). indeed, for the massive case,
constraints are second-class and we can impose only a polarization subalgebra tp  t ,
c c = 0 b > t (which
which contains a characteristic subalgebra tc =< x r
is isomorphic to gc) and half of the rest of generators in t (excluding ); in total,
q = c +  c
2   independent constraints, which lead to constrained wave functions
having support on fm6=0 = 3  c  fm=0 arbitrary elds; these els correspond to c
massless vector bosons attached to tc and   c massive vector bosons. in particular,
for the massless case, we have tc = t , i.e. c =  , since constraints are rst-class (that

a, with c ab

a similar situation happens in the bosonic string theory, where we can impose as constraints half of
the virasoro operators (the positive modes ln0) only; that is, the appearance of central terms in the lie
algebra (12) precludes the whole virasoro algebra to be imposed as constraints, and only a polarization
subalgebra can be consistently imposed.

12

is, we can impose q =  restrictions) and constrained wave functions have support on
fm=0 = 3   = 2  fm6=0 arbitrary elds corresponding to  massless vector bosons.
the subalgebra tc corresponds to the unbroken gauge symmetry of the constrained theory
and proves to be an ideal of ggood [remember the characterization of good operators before
eq. (24); see also refs. [8, 9] for a denition and subtle distinctions between constraints
and gauge symmetries inside gaq].

let us work out a couple of examples. cartan (maximal abelian) subalgebras of t
will be preferred as candidates for the rigid subgroup of the unbroken electromagnetic
gauge symmetry. thus, let us use the cartan basis < hi, e > instead of < t a >, and
denote {i, } the coordinates of t attached to this basis (i.e.  are complex eld
coordinates attached to each root , and i are real eld coordinates attached to the
maximal torus of t). for t = su(2)(x) and  = 1h1, the characteristic, polarization
and constraint subalgebras (leading to the electric eld representation) are:

gc =< x l

p =< x l

, or the other
way round). the new couple of basic operators g1  x r
1 (these are basic because they
can no longer be written in terms of a and e) represent two new eld degrees of freedom
which are transferred to the vector potentials a1 to conform massive vector bosons; i.e.
g1 can be seen as the longitudinal component of a1, which is missing (is zero) in the
massless case. thus, the constrained theory corresponds to a self-interacting eld theory
of a massless vector boson a1 with unbroken gauge subgroup tc = u(1)(x)  su(2)(x)

contrary, the vector elds x r
3 are devoid of dynamical content, as can be seen from the
third line of (29), and can be simultaneously imposed as constraints in tp (this is because
of the particular choice of mass matrix , which determines dierent symmetry breaking
patterns). as for t = su(2)(x), the new couples of basic operators g1,2  x r
1,2
represent four new eld degrees of freedom which are transferred to the vector potentials
a1,2 to conform massive vector bosons. thus, the constrained theory corresponds to
a self-interacting theory of two massless vector bosons a1,2, two massless charged vector
bosons a3 [the unbroken gauge subgroup is now tc = su(2)  u(1)(x)  su(3)(x)]
and four charged vector bosons a1,2 with mass cubed m3

summarizing, new basic operators g  x r

i 6= 0, and new non-trivial
good operators ci = {casimir operators of t } (i runs the range of t) enter the theory,
in contrast to the massless case. for example, for t = su(2)(x), the casimir operator is

, with c 

2 = 2.

c(x) = ( g1(x) + 1)2 +

( g+1(x) g1(x) + g1(x) g+1(x)) .

(30)

also, the hamiltonian density 00(x) =  tr [e2(x) + b2(x)] for m = 0 is aected in
the massive case m 6= 0 by the presence of extra terms proportional to these non-trivial
casimir operators (which are zero on constrained wave functionals in the massless case),
as follows:

00

m6=0(x) = 00

m=0(x) +xi

m2
i

ci(x) .

(31)

m6=0(x) = e is also modied by the presence of

thus, the schodinger equation r d3x 00

extra terms.

as already mentioned in reference to the virasoro group, pseudo-cocycle parame-
ters such as i are usually hidden in a redenition of the generators involved in the
pseudo-extension gi(x) + i  g
i(x). however, whereas the vacuum expectation value
h0| gi(x)|0i is zero, the vacuum expectation value h0| g
i(x)|0i = i of the redened
operators g
i(x) is non-null and proportional to the cubed mass in the direction i of
the unbroken gauge symmetry tc, which depends on the particular choice of the mass
matrix . thus, the eect of the pseudo-extension manifests also in a dierent choice of
a vacuum in which some gauge operators have a non-zero expectation value. this fact
reminds us of the higgs mechanism in non-abelian gauge theories, where the higgs elds
point to the direction of the non-null vacuum expectation values. however, the spirit of
the higgs mechanism, as an approach to supply mass, and the one discussed in this pa-
per are radically dierent, even though they have some common characteristics. in fact,
we are not making use of extra scalar elds in the theory to provide mass to the vector
bosons, but it is the gauge group itself that acquires dynamics for the massive case and
transfers degrees of freedom to the vector potentials.

it can be easily proven taking into account that the vacuum is annihilated by the right version of the
i is always in tp; that is, it is zero on constrained

polarization subalgebra dual to gp [18]; also, gi = x r
wave functionals phys., including the physical vacuum.

14

before nishing, let us show how to incorporate fermionic matter into the theory
and outline the main changes in the foregoing discussion had we considered it from the
beginning.

5 incorporating fermionic matter

fermionic matter can enter the theory through extra (dirac) eld coordinates l(x), l =
1, . . . , p, which we can assemble into a column vector (x), and an extra cocycle matter

leading to a quantizing supergroup gsg. the group law that describes this boson-fermion

gauge theory is (10) together with

(x) = (x) + (u(x))(x) ,
(x) = (x) + (x)(u(x)1) ,

matter  iz d3x (cid:16) 0(u )  (u 1)0(cid:17) ,

(32)

where (u) is a p-dimensional representation of t acting on the column vectors ,
and 0 is the time component of the standard dirac matrices . to compute the
left- and right-invariant super-vector elds x l,r and the polarized super-wavefunctionals
(a, e, u, , ; ), we have to take into account the grassmann character of the dirac eld

following the main steps described in this article and by taking care of the subtleties intro-
duced by the anti-commutation of grassmann variables (see [17] for the nite-dimensional

coordinates. the unitary irreducible representations of gsg can easily be constructed by
example of the super-galilei group gsg(m)). we should mention that, in the presence of

fermion sources, the innitesimal version of the constraint (18), i.e. the gauss law, is
modied to

(33)

(where a denote the generators of ) in accordance with other standard approaches.
other interesting questions like chiral anomalies are left to future publications.

6 some comments and outlook

one question which is worthwhile to comment upon is the preservation of renormaliz-
ability for a non-trivial mass matrix  6= 0. since our approach to quantization is not
perturbative, we must answer this question using general arguments.
in fact, from a
group-theoretical point of view, there is no reason why a given unitary irreducible repre-
sentation of a group g (namely, the massive one) can show bad properties, like inescapable
divergences, whereas other (namely, the massless one) does not. even more, when we use
the term unbroken gauge symmetry, in referring to tc, we mean simply the subgroup of
t devoid of dynamical content; the gauge group of the constrained theory is, in both the

15

massless and massive cases, the group t = t /u(1), although, for the massive case, only
a polarization subgroup tp can be consistently imposed as a constraint. this is also the
case of the virasoro algebra (12) in string theory, where the appearance of central terms
does not spoil gauge invariance but forces us to impose half of the virasoro operators only
(the positive modes ln0) as constraints.

thus, the spontaneous breakdown of the gauge symmetry group t manifests through
non-trivial transformations of the phase  of the wave functional  under the action of
t , leading to the appearance of new internal eld degrees of freedom which modify the
eld mass content of some vector potentials a, depending on the choice of mass-matrix
elements i = 2 tr(t i). this situation recalls the important physical implications of
geometric phases (namely, berrys phase) in quantum mechanics, the case discussed in the
present paper being a particular one. in other words, the presence of mass is detected by
the wave functional  in its gauge excursions through the conguration space, as happens
with the presence of monopoles. also, the zeroes (critical values) of the mass-matrix
elements i correspond to dierent phases of the physical system characterized by the
corresponding unbroken gauge symmetry tc; thus, the system can undergo spontaneous
phase-transitions between dierent phases corresponding to non-equivalent brations t
of t by u(1) (i.e. dierent choices of characteristic subgroups tc of t ).

open questions remain about what happens when a true cocycle 3 exists; for exam-
ple, we can nd non-trivial central extensions t of t = map(s1, t) by u(1) (kac-moody
groups) in one compact spatial dimension, deformations which correspond to anomalous
situations in the standard (canonical) approach to quantization of gauge theories. this
fact makes the quantization of massive yang-mills elds (in this scheme) not so triv-
ial, even in one spatial dimension. also, it would be worth exploring the richness of
the case t = su() (innite number of colours), the lie-algebra of which is related
to the (innite-dimensional) lie-algebra of area preserving dieomorphisms of the sphere
sdif f (s2) (see [19] and references therein). in general, the cohomological richness, i.e.
the number of inequivalent central (pseudo) extensions, of t = map(m, t) depends on
the topology of m. also, as usually happens with central charges, a quantization of the
mass parameters mc  (n)1/3, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . could arise from the compact character of
the involved manifolds.

another question that deserves further study is, of course, the physical implications

that this new point of view carries along.
