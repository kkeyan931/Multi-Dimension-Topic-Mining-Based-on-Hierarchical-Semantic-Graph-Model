abstract

we investigate maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions and some of its soli-

tonic solutions. by focusing on a truncation of the gauged so(5) r-symmetry group to
its u (1)2 cartan subgroup, we construct general two charge black holes that are asymp-
totically anti-de sitter. we demonstrate that 1- and 2-charge black holes preserve 1
2 and
1
4 of the supersymmetries respectively. additionally, we examine the odd-dimensional self-
duality equation governing the three-form potential transforming as the 5 of so(5), and

provide some insight on the construction of membrane solutions in anti-de sitter back-

grounds.

1. introduction

the gauged supergravities in odd dimensions have an interesting feature: the anti-

symmetric tensor potentials transforming in the fundamental representation of the r-

symmetry group obey rst order self-duality conditions [1,2,3]. in particular, this odd-

dimensional self-duality construction was shown to be necessary in order to ensure that

only the correct propagating modes of the anti-symmetric tensor potentials survives in

the presence of gauging. in this note we focus on the gauged n = 4 (i.e. the maximally

supersymmetric) theory in seven dimensions [2], although similar results may be extended

to other odd-dimensional theories as well.

the n = 4 gauged seven-dimensional supergravity theory involves the gauging of

a so(5) subgroup of sl(5, r), resulting in a theory with both a gauged so(5)g and a

composite so(5)c local invariance. the bosonic eld content includes a graviton, ten

yang-mills gauge elds transforming in the adjoint of so(5)g, ve rank-three tensors

transforming as a 5 under so(5)g and 14 scalars parameterizing a sl(5, r)/so(5)c coset.
for the fermions, there are four gravitini and 16 spin- 1

2 elds transforming as the 4 and 16
of so(5)c respectively. interestingly enough, the potential arising from the gauging has

two critical pointsa saddle point with so(4) symmetry and a so(5) stationary point.

without brany matter, the former is unstable and breaks all supersymmetries [4].

our goal is to analyze solitonic objects charged under the so(5)g r-symmetry group.

these include both 0- and 3-branes carrying vector-potential charges and 1- and 2-branes

charged with respect to the three-form potentials. the latter objects have been antici-

pated (see e.g. [5,6]) and their existence plays an important role in the dierent aspects of

ads/cft correspondence [7]. for a recent discussion of branes in ads spaces from the

point of view of bps algebras in the ads5 case see [8]. in particular, ref. [8] examines the

conditions imposed by the preservation of half or less supersymmetry on the r-symmetry

group in ads5. although similar analysis is lacking for ads7, we show in this note that (at
least at the level of solutions) so(5)  so(4) is required in ads7 for having a membrane
which is electrically charged with respect to the three-form potential and with gauge elds

forming an instanton conguration transverse to the brane. it would be interesting to nd

the corresponding extension of the supersymmetry algebra and the complete analysis of

the branes in this case.

2. n = 4, d = 8 gauged supergravity

we begin with a discussion of the gauged n = 4, d = 7 supergravity theory itself.

here i, j = 1, . . . , 5 denote so(5)g indices, and i, j = 1, . . . , 5 denote so(5)c indices. in
general we follow the notation of ref. [2], except that we work with a metric of signature
( + . . . +). the 14 scalar degrees of freedom are contained in the sl(5, r)/so(5) coset

corresponding dirac matrices i. although such spinor indices are hidden for simplicity,
we note here that not only is i -traceless, ii = 0, but its variation (2.3) is as well (as
is required for consistency).

since the full gauged supergravity theory is rather involved, we proceed with a sim-
plication of the eld content. in particular, as so(5)g has rank two, we focus on a u (1)2
truncation of the full non-abelian theory (a similar simplication was performed in [9] in

the context of the n = 8, d = 4 gauged supergravity theory). performing a gauge choice

of identifying so(5)g with so(5)c, we specialize to a diagonal scalar vielbein of the form

vi

i = diag[ e1

e1

e2

e2

e21+22 ],

(2.4)

2

where 1 and 2 are two independent real scalars. with this choice it is natural to restrict
ourselves to the two cartan gauge elds a12
three-form potential c5

 (we subsequently drop the index 5 as there will be no confusion

 as well as a single

  a(1)

  a(2)

 and a34

with only a single three-form eld).

with the above choice of truncation, we are left with a model containing gravity, two

scalars, two u (1) gauge elds and a single three-form potential. while this eld content

does not necessarily correspond to a consistent truncation of the n = 4 model, solutions

to the truncated equations of motion will necessarily extend to solutions of the full theory.

with this in mind, the truncated bosonic lagrangian has the form

3. the ads black hole solution

black hole solutions in spaces that are asymptotically either de sitter or anti-de sit-

ter have been known for a long time. more recently, supersymmetry properties of the

four-dimensional reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole have been considered in [10] in the

context of n = 2 gauged supergravity (which contains a single graviphoton and no scalars).

subsequently, more general multiple charged ads black holes have been constructed and

studied in ve dimensions [11,12] as well as in four dimensions [13].

4

all such multiple-charged ads black holes have a similar structure regardless of di-

mension, and appear as simple ads generalizations of the p = 0 case of the family of

generic p-brane solutions. this in fact led the authors of [16] to present the ads black

hole solution of n = 4, d = 7 gauged supergravity without actual construction of the

lagrangian (2.5). presently we construct a two-charge ads black hole solution to the

bosonic equations of motion (2.7)(2.10) after setting the three-form potential to zero as

appropriate for a black hole. the resulting general non-extremal solution has the form

ds2 = (h1h2)4/5f dt2 + (h1h2)1/5(cid:16) dr2

and contains information on both the non-extremality of the solution and its anti de-sitter
nature. the extremal limit is obtained by letting k  0 and    with q  k sinh2 
xed.

turning to the supersymmetry properties of the extremal black holes, we nd it more

convenient to begin with the spin- 1

2 variations (2.13). in the extremal limit we nd

(3.8)

note that the form of the angular components of  i ensures that the angular part of
(3.7) corresponds to modied killing spinors on the sphere [17].

the above form of the killing spinor equations, obtained for the general two-charge

solution, is presented in a symmetric manner; it is no longer fully appropriate for the case
of a 1
2 -supersymmetric solution, corresponding to a single active charge. nevertheless,
assuming that the single charge is carried by f (1)
 (so that h2 = 1), it is straightforward
to remove terms dependent on p (2) and (2) from (3.7). the resulting killing spinors are
given by (3.7) after dropping p2 and with the replacement   1(1).

4. membranes in ads7

proceeding from the analysis of the black holes in ads7, we now wish to investigate

the possibility of constructing extended objects in an ads background. in particular, we

now consider membranes which are electrically charged with respect to c3. to the best

of our knowledge, all solutions discussed so far in the ads literature have the antisym-

metric tensor elds which are in the fundamental representation of the r-symmetry group

switched o. turning on such elds poses several diculties which apparently have not

yet been fully addressed. these include understanding the nature of the odd-dimensional

self-duality equation (2.9) as well as the construction of killing spinors appropriate to the

brane in an ads background.

as as rst step in constructing a membrane solution with an active c3 eld, we

set the gauge elds to zero (they will be reexamined subsequently).

in this case it is

natural to expect the so(4) symmetry to be restored, so that the r-symmetry breaking
is given simply by so(5)g  so(4) without the further breaking to u (1)2. this may be
accomplished by setting 1 = 2 = , resulting in the further truncation of the potential
v to

v = 8e4  8e6 + e16.

(4.1)

while the three-form equation of motion was given in (2.9), we note that it may be rewrit-

ten in second-order form as

(e8g) = 

m
24



g

,

(4.2)

where g = 4[c]. note however that the usual antisymmetric tensor gauge invari-
ance is lacking in (4.2), as the bare potential must still satisfy the rst order equation (2.9).

in this form, the odd-dimensional self-duality condition indicates that g4 provides its own
source. in fact, written as d(e8  g) = mg, we see that the magnetic components of g4
serve as its electric source. as a result, the usual distinction between electric and magnetic

2- and 1-branes respectively is not so clear in this instance.

the membrane ansatz implies a split of the coordinates into three longitudinal and
four transverse dimensions. writing the transverse space as r+  s3 suggests a natural
choice of the line element to be of the form

ds2 = e2a[dt2 + d~x2] + e2bdr2 + e2cr2d2
3,

(4.3)

7

with ~x denoting the spatial longitudinal coordinates {x1, x2}. the resulting split suggests
an ansatz for the three-form in which its non-vanishing components are c012 (electric) and

c123 (magnetic); these two components are further related by the self-dual equation of

motion (2.9).

at this stage one immediately runs into a diculty in that the metric (4.3) does not

easily admit a vacuum ads7 background. this issue arises from the separation of the
three coordinates {t, x1, x2} to form the longitudinal directions of the membrane; this split
destroys the overt symmetry among the six spatial dimensions (and ads is maximally

symmetric). physically, this corresponds to the notion that static extended objects do not

appear to exist in anti-de sitter geometries. similar issues have already been discussed

for ads black holes, where no examples of multi-center black hole solutions in an ads

background have yet been obtained.

while it remains an open problem to reconcile the symmetry of the ads background

with that of an extended object, we may nevertheless study the characteristics of the

membrane solution in an asymptotic regime.

in this manner we are able to provide a

closer investigation of the rst order self-duality equation (2.9). far from the membrane

we expect the geometry of spacetime to be asymptotically ads7. examining the minimum

of the potential (4.1) indicates the presence of a cosmological constant corresponding to
r =  m2
4 (gg  gg). furthermore, as r  , the s3 asymptotically attens
out [18], so that the line element (4.3) may take on a horospherical form

ds2 =

m2r2

[dt2 + d~x2] +

m2r2 dr2 +

d2

3,0.

(4.4)

here d2

3,0 = d2

3 denotes the at metric on t 3. this modication to the con-
sideration of non-spherical horizons is a possibility of non-asymptotically-at spacetimes,

1 + d2

2 + d2

and has been used in the investigation of ads black holes [13,14,12,16,19].

in the background of (4.4), the self-dual equation of motion now takes on the sym-

metric form

and hence yields

c012 = 
c123 =

to yield

c123

(4.7)

indicating that both components are of equal importance. in fact, this results in a cancel-
lation between electric and magnetic terms so that c2
  (q2/m6)o(r(10+p)). this
has direct correspondence to the vanishing of f 2
2k+1 for self-dual (2k + 1)-forms in 4k + 2
dimensions. as a result, at least to this order, c2
 drops out of the scalar equation of
motion, (2.7), so that  may be set to zero, indicating the consistency of such asymptotics.

examination of the einstein equation, (2.10), nally reveals the distinction between the
longitudinal and transverse directions resulting from the relative minus sign between c2
and c2

012
123 . presumably this gives rise to the appropriate powers of harmonic functions
that naturally appear in p-brane ansatze when the back-reaction of the test-membrane

(4.7) is taken into account.

[20,17]  satisfying both projections p = 1

in the absence of a test-membrane, the ads line element (4.4) admits killing spinors
2 (1  r). as an asymptotic solution, we note
that the killing spinor equations arising from (2.12) may no longer be satised identically,
but only up to terms of o(r5) compared to the ads background. on the other hand, for

, we obtain at leading order

23
m2r3 (c012012 + c123 123 )5
23
m2r3 0125(c012 + c123 r)
43q
m2r5 0125p+.

 





(4.8)

therefore this indicates as expected that the membrane preserves only half of the original

supersymmetriesnamely those corresponding to p+ = 0.

5. discussion

the seven-dimensional n = 4 gauged supergravity [2,4] admits a rich structure, both

in terms of symmetries and of solutions. in fact a curious feature of this theory is that,

unlike gauged maximal supergravities in d = 4 and d = 5, here the potential admits not

only a so(5) stationary point, but also a so(4) saddle point. it is curious that this latter

9

point also appears to correspond naturally to the symmetry breaking induced by a single

c3-charged membrane.

while we have provided the asymptotic behavior of a membrane in an ads back-

ground, the full solution is still lacking. the diculty in the construction of such a so-

lution appears to lie in the presence of extra longitudinal directions: viewed from the

worldvolume, these ought to be at, while viewed from ads spacetime these ought to

be curved. this contradiction is similar in spirit to one that arises when searching for

multi-center black hole solutions in ads. in that case there is diculty in resolving the

bps no-force condition with the curvature of space.

one possible approach to investigating extended p-brane solutions involves the use

of non-static metric ansatze. alternatively, one may involve dependence of the metric on

more than a single coordinate. for example one possibility is a metric in the modied

horospherical form

ds2 = e2a+2z(dt2 + dx2) + e2bdz2 + e2c+2zdyidyjij,

(5.1)

where a, b and c are functions of r = |~y|. while the rationale behind this choice is to
separate out the ads coordinate z from the brane transverse coordinate r, this has in

practice not yet yielded any further solutions.

our nal comment on the membrane solution regards the gauge elds that so far were
set to zero. to turn these on, it appears we do not want to work in the u (1)2 truncation
presented in section 2. instead it is important to keep the full so(4)  so(5)g symmetry
(always taking 1 = 2 = ) and to retain the non-abelian so(4) gauge elds aij
 where
i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. in this case the resulting lagrangian and equations of motion are easily

generalized from those given in (2.5)(2.10). the supersymmetry variations are similarly
obtained. in particular, the spin- 1
2 variations, (2.13), collapse to give the single variation

note, however, that while this is the form of a 1

2 -supersymmetry projection that would be
used to construct a supersymmetric membrane solution in the ungauged supergravity, it is

nevertheless distinct from the p obtained in the asymptotic limit of the previous section.

based on analogy with the ungauged theory, it appears that a complete membrane

solution would have to incorporate a supersymmetry projection more of the form of ep

than of the form p. thus we conjecture that it is in general possible to turn on the

gauge elds by taking an instanton conguration (5.3) transverse to the membrane (both

in spacetime and in the r-directions) without breaking any extra supersymmetry. it

is conceivable that, in analogy with the ads5 case [8], there are other breakings of the
r-symmetry corresponding to bps states preserving less than half of the supersymmetry.

it would certainly be interesting to see what gauge congurations these would correspond

to.

finally, we point out that the membrane solution in ads7 has the interpretation of
the near m 5-brane limit of the m 5 intersect m 2 system in eleven dimensions. while the
complete m 5  m 2 system preserves only 1
4 of the supersymmetries, in the near-horizon
limit of the m 5-brane this is restored to 1
2 of the supersymmetries. we have thought about
taking advantage of this decoupling limit in constructing the membrane solution from an

eleven-dimensional starting point. however fully localized intersecting brane solutions still

appear quite obscure [21,22,23,24]. even in the decoupling limit of one of the branes,

it appears that some delocalization in one of the relative transverse directions remains

necessary (as a technical simplication). such considerations are presumably related to

the issues that must be addressed in performing a direct construction of the membrane

solution in ads7.
