abstract

we obtain a series expansion for the one loop fermion contribution
to the eective potential evaluated for constant gauge potentials in the
su(2) theory with a massive fermionic doublet. the series converges
for electric elds bounded in terms of the magnetic elds and the gauge
potentials. it turns out that fermion pair creation may be absent (to
order h) for arbitrary strong pure electric elds, with a proper choice
of the gauge potentials.

almost fty years ago, j. schwinger obtained [1] in the context of q.e.d.
the one loop fermion contribution to the electromagnetic eective lagrangian
for the special case of constant elds. it seems there are no similar results
concerning yang-mills elds. our intention here is to consider the analogous
problem for the su(2) theory. we shall assume constant values throughout
minkowski space for the gauge potentials; non-abelianity obviously assures
this does not necessarily implies the vanishing of the eld strengths. we shall
restrict to the case of a fermionic spin j = 1/2 multiplet. calculations prove
to signicantly simplify for this representationa due to the properties of the
pauli matrices.

asee the next footnote. the general case will be analyzed in a subsequent paper.

we begin by writing the basic lagrangian as

l =

f a + id  m ,
f a

with

where a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 denote the group indices (summation over repeated
indices is understood). aa
 are the gauge potentials, including the coupling
constant of the theory.  represents the fermion doublet, with m > 0 the
corresponding mass. abc is the levi-civitta antisymmetric tensor and a are
the pauli matrices.

the one loop fermionic contribution to the eective action sef f for aa

follows most directly in the path integral formalism by integrating out [2] the
 eld

sef f = i ln det (((p  aa



a
2

)  m),

(4)

where det is taken in the functional sense and p are the translation operators
in the coordinate space. m tacitly incorporates the i prescription. using
the charge conjugation matrix cc 1 = t

 and

[p, aa

] = 0,

one can eliminate [3] the  matrices to obtain

sef f = 

i
2

ln det ((p  aa



a
2

)2  m2).

(5)

(6)

we use next the ln det=tr ln formula combined with the schwinger rep-
resentation for the logarithm. when tracing over space-time coordinates,

translational invariance allows separation of the four-volume factor r d4x;

the trace in the spinorial space yields simply a 4 factor; tracing over the
group indices amounts to evaluate, after expanding the square in eq. (6), the

2

trace of a su(2) matrixb in the exponential parameterization. one nally
gets for the eective potential

aa. now, expression above requires subtraction of the cor-
where a2 = aa
responding aa
 = 0 quantity. we do this as follows. let us consider a
four-vector k respecting k k = a2; one easily veries that subtraction is
equivalent to replacing the cos factor in eq. (7) with the dierence

cos sq(paa

)(paa

)  cos s(pk).

(8)

this trick will make apparent at the end of the calculations that the potential
vanishes for f a

 = 0, as to be expected on physical grounds.

we rotate next the p-integration contours in the complex plane

(9)

(latin indices i, j, k run over 1, 2, 3) and shift to four-dimensional spherical
coordinates. at this step, we expand the cosines in taylor series, after which
we perform the radial integrations. each term yields a nite result for s > 0
xed. to account for the angular integrations, it is convenient to dene the
matrices

and similarly for k, along with the quantities

bfor j > 1/2 representations, anticommutations of the group generators lead to
su(2j+1) elements, generally not belonging to su(2) representations. this is unpleas-
ant since the quantity under the corresponding radical in eq.
(7) ceases to contain a
purely quadratic form in p, which complicates the integrations.

notations in eq. (12) are as follows: n is the unit four-vector nn = 1
with the lowered indices indicating summation with respect to the euclidean
metric. dn is the innitesimal angle around n, the integration extending
over the euclidean 3-sphere.

in the resulting series, the behavior of terms for s  0 in the s-integrations
formally splits vef f into an innite and a nite part. the innite part reads

v inf =

(13)

however, n = 0, 1 terms vanish due to the angular integrations (see eq. (20)
below)

(0) = (1) = 0.

(14)

for n = 2 the s-integral diverges logarithmically, but this is no trouble since

(2) =

f a.

(15)

the divergence is proportional to the pure yang-mills lagrangian, which
amounts to a wave function and coupling constant renormalization. dis-
carding an innite contribution and imposing aa
  0 unit wave function
renormalization, one gets the nite result

the polynomials under the radicals are, in order, the determinants of the a,
k matrices in the exponent in eq. (19), respectively. this nishes our calcu-
lation. one sees that the indeterminacy introduced by k disappeared. the
eective potential is the sum (note the explicit gauge potential dependence
via a2)

vef f = v inf

(ren) + v f in.

(24)

it is clear from eqs. (20), (22), (23) that for vanishing eld strengths all (n)
are zero, which makes vef f = 0.

we come now to the question of the convergence of series (17). observe

that numerical factors imply it behaves as

4n (n).

we shall demand for safety convergence of each sum corresponding to the

(27)

for the rst sum we proceed as follows. note that 0 = 0 is always an
eigenvalued of a
, and let 1, 2, 3 denote the rest of eigenvalues. this
makes i1
1,2,3 the roots of the cubic polynomial in eq. (20). the correspond-
ing sum in eq. (25) can be organized as

(30)

at a closer inspection it turns out that for a2 and ~ba xed, inequalities (29)
dene a bounded set in the ~ea space. detailed analysis in the general case
proves fairly involved, as explicit solutions of a cubic equation have to be
considered. we shall restrict to the special case z3 = 0, or
~e1  ( ~b2  ~b3) + ~e2  ( ~b3  ~b1) + ~e3  ( ~b1  ~b2)  ~b1  ( ~b2  ~b3) = 0,

(31)

for which situation drastically simplies. one nds that conditions (29)
reduce then to the single inequality

e2 < b2 + 16m4 1  (a2)

a2

2m2! 1 

a2

4m2! ,

where

e2 = ~ea  ~ea, b2 = ~ba  ~ba,

(33)

and  is the heaviside step function.

relation (32) deserves a comment. it says [cf. eq.(27)] that the upper
bound for e2 is always larger than b2 (which gives in fact the lowest upper
bound, corresponding to the limiting case a2  2m2). the point is that
for b2 xed and a2 < 0 variable there is generally no denite upper bound:
with a proper choice of the gauge potentials it can be set arbitrarily high. a
simple example is provided by pure electric elds ~ba = 0. (we mention here
that denition of ~ea, ~ba in terms of aa

 imposes the a priori inequality
(a2)2

(34)

e2  b2 

,

3

which was already used in deriving eq. (32).)

it is remarkable that pure magnetic elds ~ea = 0 have convergence con-
ditions satised, no special restrictions assumed. in this case one can always
consider aa
0 = 0, which automatically veries eq. (27). one further notes
that i1,2,3 are real and non-negative, as ia
jk is a real symmetric semi-positive
denite matrix. taking into account that

3

ir = z1 < 4,
it follows that inequalities (29) are also assured.

0 <

xr=1

(35)

we end with the observation that vef f has no imaginary part. hence,
within the validity of our result, there is no spontaneous fermion pair cre-
ation. convergence conditions formulated above can be regarded as sucient
conditions to forbid this phenomenon (to order h, of course). one is led to
the conclusion that fermion pair creation is not necessarily occurring for pure
electric elds, in contrast to the notorious case of quantum electrodynamics.
absence of the absorptive part in our result is, after all, not surprising: one
knows that particle creation in time-independent elds is essentially a non-
perturbative eect [4], while in our calculation this feature was lost with the
taylor expansion of the cosines in eq. (8).
