abstract

we construct the three point function involving an axial vector current and two energy-
momentum tensors for four dimensional conformal eld theories. conformal symmetry deter-
mines the form of this three point function uniquely up to a constant factor if the necessary
conservation conditions are imposed. the gravitational axial anomaly present on a curved space
background leads to a non-zero contribution for the divergence of the axial current in this
three point function even on at space. using techniques related to dierential regularisation
which guarantee that the energy-momentum tensor is conserved and traceless, we calculate the
anomaly in the three point function directly. in this way we relate the overall coecient of the
three point function to the scale of the gravitational axial anomaly. we apply our results to the
examples of the fermion and photon axial currents.

1 introduction

conformal symmetry constrains strongly correlation functions in quantum eld theory
not only in two, but also in higher dimensions. a formalism for constructing conformally
covariant three point functions in general dimensions d involving operators of arbitrary
spin has been discussed in [1], [2]. this formalism has been applied to three point functions
which are determined in terms of a nite number of linearly independent forms.
in
particular expressions for conserved vector currents and the energy-momentum tensor
were found and various ward identities were analysed.

even for theories which are conformally invariant on at space, for a curved space back-
ground conformal invariance is broken by anomalies involving the curvature for theories
in even dimensions. these anomalies generate a non-zero trace for the energy-momentum
tensor. on at space they lead to anomalous local contributions to the ward identities
reecting conformal symmetry. in consequence the coecients of the conformal anoma-
lies are related to the coecients of the independent forms of the conformal correlation
functions. for example in two dimensions the central charge is present as coecient of
both the energy-momentum tensor two and three point functions and the the conformal
trace anomaly which in two dimensions is just the curvature scalar. for the four dimen-
sional case, the trace anomaly coecients c, a have been related to the coecients of the
three independent forms present in general in the energy-momentum tensor three point
function in [2].

here we consider the conformal three point function ht(x)t(y)a(z)i involving an
axial vector current and two energy-momentum tensors in four dimensions. we show
that conformal invariance and energy-momentum conservation determine the structure of
this three point function uniquely up to an overall coecient. moreover we relate this
coecient to the coecient of the gravitational anomaly contributing to the divergence of
the axial vector current on a curved space background. this requires a careful analysis of
the short-distance behaviour of the three point function, for which we follow an approach
analogous to the one we have used in [2] for the gauge axial anomaly contributing to
the three point function involving two conserved vector currents in addition to the axial
current.

the gravitational axial anomaly is of particular interest for supersymmetric theories
since supersymmetry relates the anomalous divergence of the axial r symmetry current
to the anomalous trace of the energy-momentum tensor depending on c, a. this anomaly
has been used to obtain formulae for the change in c, a between xed points [3] which
strongly support the idea of a four dimensional extension of the zamolodchikov c-theorem
[4].

recently, pachos and schiappa have also calculated contributions to the conformal
three point function ht(x)t(y)a(z)i in a second-order perturbative approach for the
abelian higgs model. these authors claim to nd two independent forms in this correlation

2

function. one of their expressions coincides with the result found in this present paper,
whereas the second form they discuss does not appear to satisfy the necessary conservation
condition for the energy-momentum tensor.

this paper is organised as follows. we begin by constructing the conformal three
point function for an axial current and two energy-momentum tensors in four dimensions
in section 2.
in section 3 we derive the anomalous ward identity for this three point
function for quantum eld theories coupled to a curved space background. by analysing
the short-distance behaviour of this three point function we relate its coecient to the
coecient of the gravitational axial anomaly in section 4. in section 5 we check our result
by rederiving the well-known result for the axial anomaly coecient for free fermions
within our approach. as a second example we consider the case of the photon axial
anomaly in section 6. section 7 contains some concluding remarks.

2 conformal three point function

we consider here four dimensional euclidean space, although the formalism applies in
arbitrary dimensions. for three points x, y, z we may dene a vector z at z by

z = 1

2z

 ln

(z  y)2
(z  x)2 =

(x  z)
(x  z)2 

(y  z)
(y  z)2 , z 2 =

(x  y)2

(x  z)2(y  z)2 ,

(2.1)

which transforms homogeneously under conformal transformations. x and y, which are
vectors at x and y, are obtained by cyclic permutation, such that

x =

(y  x)
(y  x)2 

(z  x)
(z  x)2 ,

y =

(z  y)
(z  y)2 

(x  y)
(x  y)2 .

(2.2)

for constructing conformally invariant forms the inversion matrix i, which is dened by

i(x) =   2

xx
x2

,

deti = 1 ,

(2.3)

plays an essential role since for arbitrary conformal transformations, i acts as a parallel
transport. the inversion matrix and the conformal vectors (2.1) satisfy the identities

i(x  z)z = 

(x  y)2
(z  y)2 x ,

i(y  z)i(z  x) = i(y  x)i(x) ,
which will prove to be very useful in the subsequent discussion.

i(x  z)i(z  y) = i(x  y) + 2(x  y)2xy ,
(2.4)

for the construction of conformal three point functions in euclidean space we use the
formalism developed in [1], [2], according to which conformal covariance restricts the three

(2.5)

here 1, 2, 3 denote the scale dimensions of the operators o. the indices i, j, k denote
components for the vector spaces v1, v2, v3 to which the elds o1,o2,o3 belong and
which dene representations of the group o(4). d i
1 i(i) denotes the matrix acting on v1
associated with an inversion. in (2.5) the tensor tijk
12,3(z), belonging to v1  v2  v3, is
a homogeneous function of the conformal vector z dened in (2.1),

12,3(rz) for all r  o(d) .

(2.6)

the general expression (2.5) treats the three operators in an equivalent way. to demon-
strate this we note that (2.5) may be written equivalently in the form

(2.7)

(2.8)

we now apply these general results to the three point function involving the axial vector
current a as well as two energy-momentum tensors t. on at space these operators
satisfy

a = 0 ,

t = 0 , t = t , t = 0 ,

(2.9)

discarding any gauge anomalies which do not contribute to the three point function con-
sidered here. in order to be conformal quasi-primary elds, a and t must have scale
dimension 3 and 4 respectively. the general expression (2.5) for the three point function
becomes in this special case

ht(x)t(y)a(z)i = i t

,(y  z)

(x  z)8(y  z)8

(2.13)

on (2.10). the most general solution of (2.13), which has also the correct dimension and
reects the symmetry and tracelessness properties of the energy-momentum tensor and
takes account of the odd parity properties of the axial current, is given by

tt t a

imposing conservation of the energy-momentum tensor,

ht(x)t(y)a(z)i = 0 ,

x 6= y, z ,

implies the condition

b = 6 a

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

on the parameters in (2.14). thus the three point function is entirely determined by
conformal invariance and by energy-momentum conservation up to one overall constant,
such that there is only one independent form2. moreover the three point function (2.10)
automatically satises conservation with respect to the axial vector leg for non-coincident
points.

3 ward identities

for massless quantum eld theories on a curved space background in four dimensions the
axial vector current may have an anomalous divergence given by [6] [7] [8]

ha(z)i = 1

2 ca rr

 .

(3.1)

2in a recent paper by pachos and schiappa [5] it was argued within a perturbative study of the abelian
higgs model that there are two independent forms in the three point function (2.10). however one of the
two forms proposed by these authors coincides with the form obtained here, whereas the second does not
satisfy the conservation condition (2.17), (2.18) for the energy-momentum tensor.

 is the curvature tensor for the background metric g, and ca is a model-

furthermore on curved space the energy-momentum tensor may be dened by

ht(x)i = 

2
g

w

g(x)

,

(3.2)

with w the generating functional for connected green functions. in consequence we have

ht(x)t(y)a(z)i =

4

pg(x)pg(y)pg(z)



g(x)



g(y)(cid:16)pg(z)ha(z)i(cid:17) .

also the usual dieomorphism invariance can here be expressed as

ht(x)a(z)i = (cid:16)(4)(x, z)g(cid:17)ha(z)i  (cid:16)(4)(x, z)gha(z)i(cid:17) .

(3.3)

(3.4)

using (3.3) the anomalous divergence (3.1) leads to the anomalous ward identity on

at space when g = 

ht(x)t(y)a(z)i = 4 ca e t
z

, e t

,  (4)(x  z)(4)(y  z)

(3.5)

for the three point function on at space. furthermore (3.4) has no anomaly and (2.17)
must hold even for x = y, z.

in our discussion it is more convenient to replace the riemann tensor by the weyl

tensor dened by

c = r  (g[r]  g[r]) + 1

3g[g]r .

the weyl tensor belongs to the space v c = {c} of tensors dened by

it is important to recognise that

c = c[][] ,

c[] = 0 ,

gc = 0 .

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

we may rewrite (3.1) as

(3.9)
if we dene a projection operator e c onto tensors in v c then to rst order in an expansion
about at space, g =  + h, the the weyl tensor is simply expressed as

ha(z)i = ca c c 

 .

c = 2 e c

(3.10)
where we now identify up and down indices. an explicit expression for e c may be found
in [2]. with (3.10) the at space ward identity (3.5) may be rewritten equivalently as
,     (4)(x  z)(4)(y  z) .

ht(x)t(y)a(z)i = 16 ca e c

4 anomaly calculation

given the explicit form for the three point function provided by (2.10), (2.14) and (2.18)
it is natural to endeavour to demonstrate the explicit appearance of the anomaly as in
(3.11) and obtain ca explicitly in terms of a. however a direct calculation does not give
a unique answer without further analysis due to the very singular behaviour of the three
point function for x  y  z, due to which for instance its fourier transform is ill-dened.
this singular behaviour may lead to anomalies in the conservation equations for the
energy-momentum tensor in general. therefore the axial anomaly is only unambiguous
when the energy-momentum tensor conservation equations are imposed even including
contributions with support at x = y = z. to achieve this we make use of the result that
if, on at space,

then t is automatically conserved and traceless. thus we write

t = c ,

c  v c ,

(4.1)

y

cca

,,(x, y, z) ,

ht(x)t(y)a(z)i = x

(4.2)
where cca(x, y, z) is a tensor belonging to v c  v c  v , with v the space of vector
elds, a  v . cca(x, y, z) is constructed according to the general prescription for
conformal three point functions regarding c as a quasi-primary operator of dimension
two. writing the three point function in the form (4.2) amounts to a form of dierential
regularisation [9]. a similar, albeit simpler, calculation of the axial anomaly for a theory
coupled to vector elds, maintaining the vector current conservation equations was given
in [2]. for symmetry we must require in (4.2)

cca

,,(x, y, z) = cca

,,(y, x, z) ,

and also for conservation of the axial current

z

cca

,,(x, y, z) = 0 ,

z 6= x, y .

(4.3)

(4.4)

a form for cca with the desired properties which has overall odd parity is given by

where

det i = 1 once more. the conformal three point function (4.5) may also be written in
a form in which its consistency with the general formalism (2.5) is obvious,

(4.9)

we have checked that inserting (4.8) into (4.9) and calculating the four derivatives using
the algebraic computing program form [10], we obtain (2.10) with (2.18) as expected.

the expression in (4.5) for cca(x, y, z) is homogeneous of degree 8 in x, y, z. any
ambiguity is proportional to (4)(x  z)(4)(y  z), without derivatives, but the presence
of such a term is precluded by the tensorial structure. thus the divergence of the axial
vector current in (4.4) may be unambiguously calculated even including contributions
with support at z = x, y. for this purpose we generalise results for distributions derived
in [2], which rely on the general discussion of [11]. first we use that from (2.1) we have

this expression is most easily evaluated in a frame in which x, y, z are constrained to lie on

[6], which provides a check on our calculation.

6 photons

a second eld theory example in which there is an anomaly in the conservation of an
axial current for curved space backgrounds concerns the chern-simons current in abelian
gauge theories as described in [12]. the relevant current in terms of the gauge eld is

formally this satises

k =  a f ,

f = a  a .

k = ff 

 ,

(6.1)

(6.2)

but there are potential anomalies arising from the photon triangle diagram. the current
k, dened in (6.1) so as to satisfy (6.2), may be regarded as arbitrary up to

k  k + w ,

w = w .

(6.3)

this allows for the freedom of gauge transformations since if a  a +  the current
transforms as in (6.3) with w = f.

for the gauge eld the energy-momentum tensor is given by

t = ff  1

4 ff = e t

, ff  ,

(6.4)

which is of course traceless and conserved subject to f = 0.
in the following we
endeavour to to analyse the odd parity three point function ht(x)t(y)k(z)i to see
whether the anomalous divergence suggested in [12] can be derived in a similar fashion to
the previous discussion for the axial fermion current.

in a standard covariant gauge the basic two point function for the gauge eld is given

by

ha(x)a(y)i1 =

(x  y)2 + 2(1  )

(x  y)(x  y)

(6.6)

(6.7)

the inversion on vf , the space of antisymmetric tensor elds, is manifestly conformally
covariant as expected since f is quasi-primary. under a general gauge transformation
we expect

ha(x)a(y)i  ha(x)a(y)i + x

(x, y) + (x, y) y

 .

(6.8)

where the point z here plays the role of a gauge parameter, this reduces to (6.5) for z = .
since i(x y)/(x y)2 =  1
 the rst term, depending on , is a pure
gauge. the expression in (6.9) is conformally covariant if conformal transformations
are extended to the three points x, y, z. similar non-local gauge transformations and
essentially the same result for the photon propagator were described in [13]. using the
result (6.9) we then have

the disagreement of (6.14) with (2.14) and (2.18). this is a consequence of the non-zero

be obtained by performing a further transformation of the current k of the form shown

becomes f + a/ = 0. the associated conserved energy momentum tensor is then no longer

dependent terms contribute in the three point function involving the gauge dependent current k.

which the chern-simons current (with the scale set by (6.1)) has an anomaly

on curved space, up to a factor of 2 for the numerical value of the coecient.4 thus
this second example conrms that there is a unique conserved form for the conformal
three point function, which is uniquely related to the axial anomaly present on curved
space. it should be noted that since the z
 derivative of (6.19) vanishes identically, the
transformations performed do not alter the anomaly.

7 conclusion

we have constructed the three point function involving the axial vector current as well
as two energy-momentum tensors for four dimensional conformal eld theories and shown
that this three point function is determined by conformal invariance up to an overall factor.
by analysing the short-distance behaviour we have related this factor to the coecient of
the gravitational axial anomaly.

our result is of particular interest for supersymmetric theories, for which it applies to
the three point function ht(x)t(y)r(z)i involving the axial r symmetry current. in
this case there is a gravitational axial anomaly whose coecient satises

with c, a the coecients of the weyl and euler densities in the curved space trace anomaly
respectively.

(7.1)

a direct consequence of our result (4.16) is that for theories for which the gravitational
axial anomaly is absent, ca = 0, the three point function ht(x)t(y)a(z)i vanishes
altogether, even without taking the divergence with respect to the axial vector leg. this
applies in particular to the three point function ht(x)t(y)r(z)i for specic super-
symmetric theories for which c = a. examples for such theories have been considered
recently in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, for instance in the references
listed in [14].

acknowledgements

i am very grateful to prof. d. z. freedman for pointing out
the photon triangle anomaly, and for helpful advice on this issue. furthermore i would
like to thank hugh osborn for many useful discussions.

4it is dicult to discern the origin for this numerical discrepancy, since the curved space calculation

of [12] is very dierent from the at space triangle diagram calculation performed here.
