abstract

a constant homogeneous magnetic eld is applied to a composite system made
of two scalar particles with opposite charges. motion is described by a pair of
coupled klein-gordon equations that are written in closed form with help of a
suitable representation. the relativistic symmetry associated with the magnetic
eld is carefully respected. considering eigenstates of the pseudomomentum four-
vector, we separate out collective variables and obtain a three-dimensional reduced
equation, posing a nonconventional eigenvalue problem. the velocity of the system
as a whole (with respect to the frames where the eld is purely magnetic) generates
motional terms in the formulas; these terms are taken into account within a
manifestly covariant framework.

1 introduction

the theory of many-particle systems in external elds requires particular caution,
even in the simple framework of nonrelativistic mechanics: as soon as all the con-
stituent masses are of comparable magnitudes, it becomes dicult to disentangle
the dynamics of relative variables from the motion of the center of mass.
the case of a globally neutral system of charges imbedded in a constant homo-
geneous magnetic eld is of special interest however, because (under very general
assumptions) it enjoys this property that the total pseudomomentum ~c = p ~p + e ~a
is conserved and has mutually commuting components [1][2][3] [4]. this exceptional
circumstance permits to separate, in a generalized sense, relative motion, and there-
fore provides a clean-cut denition of what is the spectrum of the system [4].
relativistic corrections have soon been considered [3] in a three-dimensional frame-
work; this is certainly sucient in a large number of applications, but fails to account
for the relativistic symmetry. indeed the constant magnetic eld has this peculiar-
ity that it does not correspond to a unique laboratory frame. when a constant
homogeneous electromagnetic eld is seen as purely magnetic in some frame (con-
ventionally referred to as lab frame), such a frame cannot be unique [5], thus total
energy, if dened as the (conserved) time component of linear momentum, is af-
fected by this ambiguity. all the directions eligible for the time axis of a possible
lab frame span a two-dimensional plane (el) with hyperbolic metric; so we are led
to pay attention to special lorentz transformations in this longitudinal plane.
thus a four-dimensional spacetime approach is warranted in order to keep under
control the full relativistic symmetry of motion.

in this paper we focus on two-body systems, because the covariant methods of rel-
ativistic particle dynamics are well understood and more tractable in this case. in
previous works [5][6] we have indicated how the mass-shell constraints for two scalar
particles undergoing mutual interaction can be minimally coupled (in closed form
and remaining compatible) with an external electromagnetic eld f wich can be
either pure electric or pure magnetic. in both cases a four-vector c , called pseu-
domomentum, is conserved and for neutral systems its four components commute
among themselves. writting down explicit equations of motion requires that we go
to a new representation, adapted to the symmetries of the external eld.
when, as we assume here, f is purely magnetic [7], a further change of representa-
tion eliminates not only the collective variables conjugate to pseudomomentum but
also a fth variable which is nothing but relative time. the outcome is a manifestly
covariant equation to be solved for a reduced wave function which depends only on
three spacelike degrees of freedom. the material that we published so far [5] was
limited to the general lines of this approach.
in this article we explicitly carry out the change of representation and write down
the reduced wave equation in a tractable form, showing the details of the various
contributions it contains. in addition we discuss whether the reduced wave equa-
tion can be considered as an eigenvalue problem, and for which parameter. we
prepare an eventual perturbation theory which will ultimately result in a covariant
framework for the spectroscopy of two-body systems.
in section 2 we display the notation used and we remind several results from previous

2

works. section 3 is devoted to the explicit reduction of the number of degrees of
freedom, and to a qualitative discussion about the various terms arising in the
reduced wave equation. section 4 contains concluding remarks and an outlook.

2 basic equations, symmetries

when pair creation can be neglected, a system of two scalar particles can be de-
scribed by a pair of coupled klein-gordon equations

2ha = m2

a 

a, b = 1, 2

referred to as the mass-shell constraints. here  has two arguments q1, q2 running
in spacetime. we cover all cases of practical interest assuming that ha = ka + v .
in the above formula 2ka = (pa  eaa(a))2 is the squared-mass operator for par-
ticle a alone in the magnetic eld, and v is a suitable modication of the term
v (0) which would describe the mutual interaction in the absence of external eld;
this modication is necessary in order to keep the mass-shell constraints mutually
compatible when the eld f is applied.
for all vectors ,  we write   f   for f. with a similar convention a(a) =
1

notice that   l = l  l and   t = t  t .
an important technical point is that applying a constant magnetic eld provides
a unique and invariant decomposition of any four-vector  into longitudinal and
transverse parts, say  = l + t . the orthocomplement of (el) in the space of
four-vectors is a two-dimensional plane (et ) endowed with elliptic metric. in any
adapted frame, l (resp. t ) has nonvanishing coordinates 0, 3 (resp. 1, 2).

qa  f in a lorentz-covariant gauge.

the theory of relativistic two-body systems, formulated many years ago along the
lines of predictive mechnics and constraints theory [8] [9] [10] [11] has been more
recently extended to cases where some external eld is present [12] [5]. here we
assume that a constant homogeneous magnetic eld is applied to a pair of opposite
charges, say e1 = e2 = e.
the constraint approach employed here has over the bethe-salpeter equation several
advantages; for example in the particular case of isolated systems (no eld applied)
the dependence on relative time gets automatically factorized out [13].
it is convenient to re-arrange the canonical variables as follows

z = q1  q2

q =

1
2

(q1 + q2)

1
2
so [z, y] = [q, p ] = i, etc.
the lie algebra of the lorentz group is generated by the tensor

(p1  p2)

y =

p = p1 + p2

m = m1 + m2 = q  p + z  y

3

with m1 = q1  p1, m2 = q2  p2. in any adapted frame, rotations in (et ) are
generated by m12 and boosts in (el) by m03.
an essential ingredient of mutual interactions [8] is the quantity ez2 = z2(zp )2/p 2.
but in order to avoid denominators in calculations, it is convenient to employ

we shall assume that

z = z2p 2  (z  p )2

v (0) = f (z, p 2, y  p )

(1)

(2)

this form is general enough to accomodate a large class of interactions.

denition
when speaking of energy-dependent interactions, we refer to the total energy of
isolated systems, namely p 2.
although z is more practical for calculations, it would be more natural to take ez2
and p 2 as independent dynamical variables, dening g(z/p 2, p 2, yp ) = f (z, p 2, y
p ). therefore we say that v (0) doesnot depend on (total) energy when the function
f takes on the form f = g(z/p 2, y  p ).
although f in (2) is supposed to be known, it would be a problem to determine
v in closed form. in the external-eld representation, which involves a new wave
function  and new operators h 
b, v , this problem is solved by making the
ansatz

a, k 

(3)
(0) = (z )f =0 (it turns out that bz commutes with yl pl). the explicit

v  = f ( bz, p 2, yl.pl)

where bz = z 
form of bz was calculated in ref. [5].

bz = z + 2(p 2

l z  p  p 2 zl  pl)l + p 2

t p 2

l l2

where the scalar l is dened as

l =

pl  z
(pl)2

(4)

(5)

the equations of motion are compatible provided [5] that bz commutes with yl  pl.
let us transform (4) in order to render this commutation property manifest. first
we split z as the sum of zl and zt in z, hence

z = (z2

l)p 2  (zt  p )2  (zl  p )2  2(zt  p )(zl  p )
develop (4) and perform elementary manipulations using (6). we get

t + z2

(6)

bz = z + 2(zt  p )(zl  p )  (zl  p )2 p 2

p 2

l

t

using (6) we notice cancellation of the terms proportional to (zt  p )(zl  p ) and we
can write

bz = z2

t p 2  (zt  p )2 + p 2(z2

l

(zl  pl)2

(7)

it is convenient to dene the projector orthogonal to pl, say



 = 

 

p 

l pl
p 2

l

because we can write

z2
l 

(zl  pl)2

p 2

l

= (zl)2

and we easily check that (z) commutes with (yl  pl). so we have

bz = z2

t p 2  (zt  p )2 + (zl)2p 2

(8)

(9)

(10)

which justies the claim that bz commutes with ylpl here we notice that zt = zt
and
(11)

(z)2 = z2

t + (zl)2

thus we nally obtain

bz = (z)2p 2  (zt  p )2

(12)

which is much more tractable than formula (4).

mass-shell constraints can be replaced by their sum and dierence, so we set

it is noteworthy that m03 and m12 are not aected by going over to the external-eld
representation. in other words we can write

m 

12 = m12,

m 

03 = m03

(16)

indeed the transformation from  to  is formally generated by b = lt where
l and t are given by (5) and (14) respectively [15]. commutation of l with m12
and m03 is obvious. for commutation of t , the only point to be checked is that
k1  k2 actually commutes with m12. but ka = k(a) where k(a) is the (half-
squared) squared-mass operator for particle a alone in the eld. we know the
constants of the motion in the one-body sector [16]. in particular we know that ka
commutes with both (ma)03 and (ma)12 . thus t commutes with m03 and m12.
finally b shares the same property, which formally proves (16). let us prove the
following

5

proposition
angular momentum in (et ) and boost in (el) are constants of the motion.
in other words we claim that our squared-mass operators both commute with the
transverse and longitudinal components of the total angular momentum.
working in the external-eld representation, all we need is to prove that m03 and
2 + 2v  and with
m12 commute with both k 
yl  pl. commutation with k 
2 separately is ensured from the properties of
single-particle motion in the eld. moreover yl pl is invariant under any spacetime
rotation. the last point to check is whether m03 and m12 actually commute with
v . it is sucient that they commute with all arguments of f in formula (3), which
is true because these three arguments are manifestly lorentz invariant.
for completeness, it is in order to remind here that pseudomomentum, originally
represented by

a + v , or equivalently with k 

1 and k 

1 + k 

c = p +

e

z  f

keeps the same expression in the external-eld representation (c  = c), and is also
conserved [5].

2.1 ultimate representation

for neutral systems, a further transformation inspired by the work of grotch and
hegstrom [3], and similar to a gauge transformation, permits to get rid of the q
variables. transforming the wave function yields  = (exp i) with the help of
the unitary transformation generated by

 =

(z.f.q)

we set

o = exp(i) o exp(i)

o = (o)

the new equations of motion

(h

yl  pl =  

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

may look like translation invariant, although they are not. the reason is that
pseudomomentum is transformed to p  by (18), that is c  = p . of course p is not
any more the generator of spacetime translations. these transformations now have
a generator p  which diers from p because  in (17) is not translation invariant.
in the ultimate representation considered here c  generates the relativistic analog
of the so-called twisted translations invoked in [4].

from now on we demand that pseudomomentum be diagonal with a timelike four-
vector k as eigenvalue. instead of c   = k  we are using our ultimate rep-
resentation and write p  = k. combining this requirement with (20) we
obtain

it is convenient to introduce here the motional parameter  = |kt|

to obtain h 
we have by (3)

is as in (26) and we must compute bz  from (10) with help of (24). (we

make the convention that bz  = ( bz) and not the reverse).
to this end we apply the transformation (18) to eq. (10). a glance at (9) shows
that (zl)2 is not aected by the transformation. remind that z is unchanged; we
notice that zt  p  = zt  p because, f being purely transverse, zt  f  z identically
vanishes. thus, using (11) we obtain

bz  = p 2

(31)

now, eqs (23)(29)(30) supplemented with (26)and (31) furnish the complete expres-
sion of h

out the reduction.

3 three-dimensional reduction

3.1 calculations

after transformation to the ultimate representation we have obtained c  = p .
calculations can be organized as follows: whereas (20) xes the dependence in the
relative time, eq.(21) allows us to factorize out the center-of-mass motion, and we
are left with the reduced wave function  which arises in eq. (21). obviously (20)
implies that

yl  kl  =  

(32)

thus  depends on z only through its projection z. it is clear that  generally
depends on  and k as parmeters.
in search for a reduced wave equation, we replace p  and yl  pl respectively by
their eigenvalues k and  in h 
for any operator o it is convenient to use the following convention

(37)

let us stress that  is just a parameter xed from the outset. as other parameters
arise in (37), namely k and , the question wether (37) can be considered as a
spectral problem, and for which eigenvalue, is not yet settled and will be considered
later on, with help of equations (41)(46). see eq. (45) below.

since  depends on z only through z, it is important to realize that neither r nor
w involve the operator zl  kl. this will be checked below and will permit us to
consider equation (37) as a three-dimensional problem involving operators r and
w acting on functions of z.

1 and k 
the explicit expression of r comes from (29), with help of (35). since k 
2
are no more than quadratic in the eld strenght, let us make the convention that
the superscripts (1), (2) respectively refer to the (homogeneous) linear and quadratic
terms in the eld. we start from (29), compute k 
2 to be inserted into (23)
and further simplify with help of convention (33). the zeroth order contribution to
r is

k
whereas (s),k depends on y and yt . as a whole, r depend only on z and y
(recall yt , zt are pieces of y, z respectively).
in view of (42)(43)(44), equation (37) may be nally written

the last term to be evaluated in (45) is w . in view of (36) we have rst to write
down the expression for v , say (30). it follows that

w = f (( bz ),k, (p )2

,k, )

(47)

in this formula (p )2 is given by (26) and bz  by (31). making the substitutions
p  k and yl  pl  , hence   , we obtain

it is clear that w does not involve the operator z  kl. formulas (48) (49) are to be
inserted into (47), then the explicit form of w will come out.

it is natural to consider (45) as an equation for the eigenvalue . but we meet a
complication because  is not independent from k2. in fact we can solve (41) for k2
and insert the result [17] into (n ),k. as a result (45) bears a nonlinear dependence
on . a similar situation was pointed out by rizov, sazdjian and todorov [18] in the
case of isolated systems undergoing energy-dependent interactions. in the presence
of magnetic eld however, the reduced wave equation is nonlinear in , even in the
simple case where the mutual interaction term v (0) does not depend on p 2. this
can be seen as follows: rst we notice that the occurence of ( bz ),k in w brings out
a dependence on k2, k2
l in
formulas (39)(43)(44). we end up with a nonconventional spectral problem which
requires a special treatment, reserved for a future work.

3.2 discussion

finally the mass-shell constraints have been reduced to the three-dimensional prob-
lem of solving (45). this formula is nonlinear in the eld strenght and might be
applied to strong elds [19]. let us review the various contributions it contains.
we distinguish motional terms, depending on  or depending on kt , where we know
that kt is linear in .
loosely speaking we could say that, in as much as the shape of w departs from the
original form assumed by v (0), every thing goes as if the mutual interaction were
somehow modied by the presence of magnetic eld.

a) system at rest
the particular case where pseudomomentum is purely longitudinal (say kt = 0)
enjoys a particular simplicity. if we assume for a moment that k coincides with kl,
it is possible to nd a frame where ~k vanishes whereas the electromagnetic eld is
purely magnetic. we refer to this situation as the case at rest.
in this case, z = z, y = y and (s),k simply reduces to y2
with k.
as zt  k in (48) vanishes, we notice that ( bz )/p 2

),k reduces to z2

, since kl coincides

. according to

(47) and to a notation dened in section 2, we can write

w = g(z2

where k  f  z vanishes in (49), so (p 2
if the mutual interaction doesnot depend on the energy, we end up with w =
g(z2
, ). thus, for energy-independent interactions, namely v (0) = g(z/p 2, y  p ),
w assumes the form g(z2
at rest, the magnetic eld doesnot modify the mutual interaction, provided this
interaction is not energy-dependent.

, ). in other words:

(f  z)2.

e2
4

in contrast, if

doesnot vanish, the shape of w may substantially depart

v (0)
p 2

from that of v (0) in strong elds, owing to the contribution of (f  z)2 in (p 2
),k.
this correction to v (0) is a genuine three-body term in this sense that it vanishes
if either the mutual interaction or the magnetic eld is turned o (pretending that
the eld is generated by a cticious third body located at innity).
looking again at equation (45), we see that, at rest, all surviving terms not included
in w can easily be identied as covariant generalizations of the usual terms present
in the non-relativistic theory [4] [20], except for a piece of r(2) which depends on

the relative angular momentum, see contribution of

z  f  y

k2

l

in formula (44). this

contribution remains small for heavy systems (k2 >> f ) but might be signicant
for light systems (k2 << f ) in a strong magnetic eld.

at rst order in the eld strenght however, the relative motion admits no correction
other than a term proportional to  (indeed f  k vanishes). for equal masses this
term is zero and there is no departure from the motion of an isolated system.

b) motional case

11

when kt is nonzero, we reckognize the motional electric eld contained in z  f  k.
for energy-dependent potentials, and even in a weak eld, this term contributes to
w through (47). but of course, it may be neglected in case of slow motion in a weak
eld, where both  and f are considered as rst order quantities, which entails that
f  k is a second order quantity. on the one hand, this can be seen as a stability
property of the neutral two-body system, under application of a constant eld. but
on the other hand, it forces one to go beyond the weak-eld-slow-motion approx-
imation if one wishes to compute signicant corrections to the energy associated
with relative motion.

4 conclusion

the coupled klein-gordon equations describing a globally neutral system have been
reduced to a three-dimensional equation involving truly motional terms and recoil
eects in a covariant fashion. in this formulation the particular symmetry associ-
ated with a constant magnetic eld in space-time is manifestly respected. after
separation of the internal motion, and after factorizing the dependence on rela-
tive time, the surviving number of degrees of freedom is nally the same as in the
nonrelativistic theory.

we now have a clean theoretical basis for the study of relativistic bound states in
a constant magnetic eld, the simplest of all the cases where an external eld is
present.
in the reduction procedure it was essential to consider eigenstates of pseudomomen-
tum. the square of this vector plays the role of an eective squared mass which can
be, in principle, evaluated by solving the reduced wave equation. but the eigenvalue
problem involved in this equation is crucially non-conventional, for the eigenvalue
arises in a nonlinear way, even if mutual interaction doesnot depend on the total
energy. this situation requires a renement of conventional methods; the method
devised in ref. [18] will help to carry out this task in the future.
our formulas are quadratic in the eld strenght and oer a starting point for inves-
tigating strong eld eects. in principle, they encompass all kinematic possibilities
of the system as a whole and permit a description of ultra-relativistic situations,
where |kt|2  |kl|2.
in the present state of the art, we notice that, in a weak eld, the slow collective
motion (rst order in ) of opposite charges interacting through a potential which
doesnot depend on the energy, escapes the above-mentioned complication; but in
this case the presence of external eld results in a rst order starck eect which
obviously vanishes for generic shapes of the mutual interaction potential. for the
harmonic oscillator for instance, this remark indicates that the naive quark model
enjoys some kind of stability property. but if we have perturbation theory in mind,
the computation of signicant corrections requires the setting of a nonconventional
treatment.

in sofar as approximations are concerned, it is in order to realize that two situations
are possible:

12

either the magnetic eld is considered (like in the previous example) as a pertur-
bation applied to the system. or, in contrast, the mutual interaction is treated as
a perturbation like in the helium atom.
in that latter case, the zeroth order approximation describes two independent parti-
cles moving in the magnetic eld; in this unperturbed motion, the transverse degrees
of freedom are bound by the magnetic eld (corrections to the corresponding spec-
tra are reserved for future work). we expect to avoid the pathology of continuous
dissolution [21] [22] for two reasons: the particules we consider here have no spin,
and we can impose positive individual energies, requiring that both p  p1 and p  p2
have positive eigenvalues.

the ansatz which allows for a three-dimensional reduction in our covariant frame-
work automatically generates various terms in the wave equation. we have seen that
the importance of these terms depends on the strenght of the eld and on the state
of motion of the system as a whole. inspection of these terms indicates that, from a
practical point of view, the shape of the mutual interaction is somehow modied
by the magnetic eld. as can be read o from (49), the modication implied by
(47) is quadratic in f and may become dominant in strong elds provided v (0) is
energy-dependent. this point concerns most of the realistic two-body potentials.
further work is needed in order to get beyond these qualitative indications.
for the sake of simplicity we have focused here on scalar particles, but naturally an
extension to particles with spin is desirable. a generalization to globally charged
systems would also be of interest.
let us nally mention that, in principle, the contact with more conventional methods
of quantum eld theory could be improved, trying to directly derive all our terms
from a bethe-salpeter equation that takes the magnetic eld into account from the
start. this would mean to remake the work of bijtebier and broeckaert [22] in a
way which respects the particular symmetry of constant magnetic eld, i.e. treating
all the possible lab frames on the same footing. to our knowledge, nobody has yet
carried out this task.

[7] we say that a eld is pure electric (resp. pure magnetic) when there exist frames
where the eld appears to be so; of course these two situations exclude one
another.

eigenvalues, which amounts to require that
