abstract

we construct partially localized supergravity counterpart solutions to the 1/2
supersymmetric non-threshold and the 1/4 supersymmetric threshold bound
state bi dyons in the d3-brane dirac-born-infeld theory. such supergravity
solutions have all the parameters of the bi dyons. by applying the iia/iib
t -duality transformations to these supergravity solutions, we obtain the su-
pergravity counterpart solutions to 1/2 and 1/4 supersymmetric bions carry-
ing electric and magnetic charges of the worldvolume u (1) gauge eld in the
dirac-born-infeld theory in other dimensions.

i. introduction

in the very weak string coupling limit (gs  0), the worldvolume theory of a d-brane
is described by the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action [15] in the at target spacetime with
vanishing form and dilaton elds. many of solitons in the dbi theory, collectively called
bions or bi solitons, have been studied, following the initial works in refs. [68]. bions
can be regarded as the boundary counterparts to the bulk supergravity solutions in
the bulk/boundary holographic duality relations [917]. more precisely, the intersection or
the end (of one brane on the other) of an intersecting bulk supergravity brane solution is
interpreted in the boundary worldvolume theory as a soliton in the worldvolume theory
[18]. such intersection or end is the source for the charge carried by the bi soliton [1921].
in fact, it is observed [6,7] that in the presence of a bion, which carries electric [magnetic]
charge of the worldvolume u(1) gauge eld of the d3-brane dbi action, a at d3-brane
develops a transverse spike, which can be interpreted as a fundamental string [d-string]
ending on the d3-brane. the coulomb energy density of such conguration is shown [7] to
match the energy density of the fundamental string or the d-string, supporting such idea.
if the bulk/boundary holographic duality is correct, then all the parameters of the world-
volume theory or soliton have to be mapped one-to-one to the bulk theory counterparts.
generally, bions are parameterized by their charges and their locations in the worldvolume
space. therefore, there have to exist the corresponding localized intersecting supergravity
solutions where at least one brane (interpreted as the bi soliton counterpart) is localized on
the worldvolume of the other (where the bi soliton lives).

there have been many eorts to construct localized intersecting brane solutions [2236].
but it has been turned out [35,36] that if one works with the most general spacetime metric
ansatz for completely localized intersecting branes, the resulting equations of motion to be
solved are non-linear coupled dierential equations, which do not have the general solution
and are almost impossible to solve. such equations of motion were solved only perturbatively
in the case of two m2-branes intersecting at a point [36].
if one instead considers the
restricted metric ansatz, which is of the same form as that of the delocalized intersecting
brane, the consistency of the equations of motion requires one of the branes to be delocalized
on the other [2224,33]. even with this simplied metric ansatz with one brane delocalized
on the other, convenient closed form of solutions are generally not known, but only the
solutions in terms of the innite series of special functions can be found [24,28]. but when
one goes to the near horizon limit of the delocalized brane, solutions can be expressed in
closed form in terms of simple elementary functions [27,2932,34]. although such solutions
are not completely localized and in some cases one has to delocalize (or compactify) some
of the overall transverse directions for the purpose of localizing one brane on the other [34]
(when the two constituent branes meet at the overall transverse space [37]), at this point this
is the only case in which one can have explicit solutions in convenient closed forms. perhaps,
such partially localized solutions might be useful for studying the holographic relations
in the restricted cases where some of directions of the worldvolume brane congurations
are delocalized. furthermore, such partially localized supergravity solutions have all the
necessary parameters of the corresponding bi solitons, namely the locations and the charges
of bions.

in this paper, we construct the partially localized supergravity solutions which are the

2

bulk counterparts to various bi solitons in the d3-brane dbi theory. many of the partially
localized supergravity solutions that are the bulk counterparts to the other solitons in the
brane worldvolumes are already presented in ref. [34]. for example, rst of all for the solitons
in m-brane worldvolume, the self-dual string [8] charged under the self-dual 3-form eld
strength in the m5-brane worldvolume corresponds to the intersecting m2- and m5-branes
where the m2-brane is localized at the m5-brane worldvolume. the 3-brane soliton [38] in
the m5-brane worldvolume corresponds to the intersecting two m5-branes where one of them
is localized on the other. the neutral (with respect to the self-dual 3-form eld strength)
string in the m5-brane worldvolume [39] corresponds to the m-wave localized in the m5-
brane worldvolume. the zero-brane (charged with respect to the hodge-dual of a transverse
scalar) in the m2-brane worldvolume corresponds to the intersecting two m2-branes where
one of them is localized on the other. similarly, the partially localized intersecting branes
in ten dimensions that are presented in ref. [34] can also be interpreted as the bulk
counterparts to the solitons in the ten-dimensional brane worldvolumes. for example, the
supergravity solution for d0-brane localized at the d4-brane is the bulk counterpart to
the bi instanton in the worldvolume theory of the d4-brane [4042], which is the double
dimensional reduction of the neutral string in the m5-brane worldvolume. the 0-brane [2-
brane] soliton on the ns5-brane worldvolume corresponds to the supergravity solution for
d1-brane [d3-brane] localized at the ns5-brane. the 3-brane soliton on the ns5-brane
worldvolume corresponds to the intersecting two ns5-branes where one of them is localized
on the other. the solitons on the worldvolume of the kaluza-klein (kk) monopole are those
on the worldvolume of the ns5-brane related through the iia/iib t -duality [43], e.g. the
0-brane [3-brane] soliton on the kk monopole worldvolume corresponds to the supergravity
solution for the d2-brane [ns5-brane] localized on the kk monopole. furthermore, the
structure of worldvolume supersymmetry algebra dictates the existence of such worldvolume
solitons (charged under the central charges of the algebra) and the possible intersection rules
among the spacetime branes [41].

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we survey various bi solitons in the
d3-brane dbi theory. in section 3, we construct the corresponding supergravity solutions
and their iia/iib t -duality transformed solutions.

ii. solitons in the dirac-born-infeld theory

in this section, we summarize the previous works on solitons in the dirac-born-infeld
theory, which are relevant to the works in the following sections, for the purpose of com-
pleteness and xing the notation.

a. dirac-born-infeld action

in the very weak string coupling limit (gs  0), a dp-brane moves in the at minkowski
spacetime with trivial eld conguration, i.e. constant dilaton and vanishing form elds.
in this limit, a dp-brane with the worldvolume coordinates  ( = 0, 1, ..., p) moving in
a (d + 1)-dimensional target space with the coordinates zm = (x, ym) (m = 0, 1, ..., d;
 = 0, 1, ..., p, m = p + 1, ..., d) is described by the dbi action:

3

sdbi = z dp+1qdet(m n zm zn + f),

(1)

where m n is the metric for the minkowskian target space and f = a  a is the
eld strength of the worldvolume u(1) gauge eld a.
in the static gauge, in which worldvolume coordinates  are identied with target

space coordinates as  = x, the dbi action (1) takes the following form:

sdbi = z dp+1qdet( + ymym + f).

(2)

since the bulk d3-brane conguration is invariant under the sl(2, r) symmetry of the
type-iib theory, the dbi action for the d3-brane should also have the sl(2, r) symmetry,
as is proven in refs. [4452]. in fact, the manifestly sl(2, r) covariant form for the d3-
brane dbi action is constructed [53], which we describe in the following. the worldvolume
u(1) eld strength f and its dual eld strength g, dened as g = 2 sdbi
f , transform
as a doublet under the sl(2, r): f  f (f = ( f g )t ,   sl(2, r)). furthermore,
the asymptotic values of the dilaton e and the axion  can be identied with an sl(2, r)
2rsu r u s = 1, as u 2/u 1 =  +
doublet complex constants u r (r = 1, 2), constrained by i
ie. here, u transforms under the sl(2, r) as u t  u t 1. recall that the scalars e
and  of the type-iib theory form the coset sl(2, r)/so(2). this coset is obtained from
the complex sl(2, r) doublet u r by gauging the u(1) = so(2) which acts as u r  eiu r.
the combination f = u t f is sl(2, r) invariant. the sl(2, r) covariant form of the dbi
action is expressed in terms of this sl(2, r) invariant f and the 4-form eld strength h as

sd3 = z d4xg(cid:20)1 +

1
2f  f 

1
16

(f   f )( f   f) +

1
4

h  h(cid:21) ,

(3)

where  is a lagrange multiplier and g is the determinant of the worldvolume metric. this
action is supplemented with the following self-duality relation

i
2

(h) f = f 

1
4

(f   f )( f   f )  f.

(4)

this relation reduces the number of independent charges of f and g to two, which can
be identied as charges whose sources are ends of fundamental string and d-string on the
d3-brane.

b. bi solitons

in this subsection, we survey various solitons in the dbi theory whose corresponding

and duality related supergravity solutions we will construct in the following section.

by applying the sl(2, r) transformation, one can bring arbitrary constants u r to u 1 = 1
and u 2 = i, corresponding to the asymptotic values e = 1 and  = 0 for the type-iib
theory scalars. note, this choice of the constants u i is preserved by the u(1) subgroup
transformation discussed in the previous subsection, just like the so(2)  sl(2, r) trans-
formation leaves the scalar asymptotic values e = 1 and  = 0 intact. with this choice,
the complex u(1) eld strength takes the form f = f + ig.

4

in this case, a general solution, which preserves 1/4 of the worldvolume supersymmetry,

has the following form [68,42,54,55]:

d = 

b = 

nq

np

xi=1
xi=1

qi

|r  xi|

pi

|r  yi|

, x =

,

y =

nq

np

xi=1
xi=1

qi

,

|r  xi|
,

pi

|r  yi|

(5)

where x and y are scalars describing target space coordinates perpendicular to the world-
volume, and r = (1, 2, 3) is the spatial worldvolume coordinates. here, d is the canonical
momentum conjugate to a = (ai), i.e. the electric induction, and b is the magnetic in-
duction (bi = 1
2ijkfjk). the solution describes electric and magnetic bions located at
dierent points in the worldvolume. the bulk interpretation of this solution is that funda-
mental strings stretching in the x-direction end on the d3-brane at xi and d-strings in the
y -direction end at yi. the parameters qi and pi are respectively related to charges of the
fundamental strings and d-strings.

a special case of this general solution which is also bps is the case when n := nq = np
and xi = yi. such a solution describes n bi dyons with charges (qi, pi) located at xi. the
bulk interpretation is n dyonic strings, each with the ns-ns and the r-r two-form potential
charges related to (qi, pi), ending at the points r = xi in the d3-brane worldvolume and
stretched in the directions qiex + piey . here, ex and ey are respectively the unit vectors in
the x- and y -directions. in this case, 1/4 of spacetime supersymmetry is preserved. the
particular case in which both electric and magnetic bions have two centers is interpreted as
the string junction [56]. this can be seen by studying the solution in the three asymptotic
regions near the two centers (r  x1 and r  x2) of the bions and far way from the bions
(|r|  ). the angles between strings in the string junction are determined by the charges
q1, q2, p1 and p2 of the bions, and are consistent with charge conservation and tension
balance, necessary for the existence of the static bps string junction conguration [5759].
the bi soliton that corresponds to the 1/2 bps type-iib dyonic string of schwarz [45]
can be similarly constructed [55]. one starts with the special case of the general solution
(5) in which pi = 0 and only one of qi is non-zero, say q1 = q1/2
(m,n) and x1 = r0. here,
we redened the charge with an arbitrary multiplicative constant (m,n) for the purpose of
charge quantization after the sl(2, r) transformation. this corresponds to a fundamental
string ending on d3-brane. in order to get the bi dyon with electric and magnetic charges
(mq, nq) and an arbitrary scalar asymptotic value  = +ie, one applies the sl(2, r)
transformation with the following matrix:

 =   e

(6)

(7)

(m,n) = n2e + (n  m)2e.

the resulting dyonic solution has the following form:

d =

, b = 

nq

|r  r0|

, x =

(m,n)q
|r  r0|

(9)

this solution is interpreted as the schwarz dyonic string [45] with the charges related to
(mq, nq) and stretching in the x-direction ending on d3-brane.

iii. supergravity solutions

in this section, we construct the partially localized supergravity solution counterparts to

the bi solitons in the d3-brane worldvolume discussed in the previous section.

a. type-iib supergravity and the sl(2, r) symmetry

in this subsection, we summarize the bosonic eective supergravity action for the type-
iib superstring and its sl(2, r) symmetry for the completeness and for the purpose of
xing the notation.

the bosonic part of the low energy eective supergravity theory for the type iib string
m n , the
m n and the dilaton  in the ns-ns sector, and the axionic scalar , the
m n and the 4-form potential dm n p q in the r-r sector. in the string

theory is described by the massless bosonic string modes. these are the graviton gstr
2-form potential b(1)
2-form potential b(2)
frame, the bosonic part of the eective supergravity action has the following form [60]:

4 ijb(i)b(j) are respectively the eld strengths

the sl(2, r) symmetry [61,62] of the type-iib theory is manifest explicitly in the eec-
tive action in the einstein frame. by applying the weyl-scaling transformation of spacetime
metric, gm n = e
m n , one can bring the action (10) to the following einstein frame
form [60]:

(12)

the einstein frame action (11) is invariant under the following sl(2, r) transformation:

(cid:18) b(1)

b(2)(cid:19) , m  mt ;

  sl(2, r),

(13)

with the metric gm n and the 4-form potential d remaining intact.

b. supergravity solution for the non-threshold bound state bi dyon

to construct the supergravity counterpart solution to the 1/2 supersymmetric bi dyon
solution in eq. (9), we start with the following partially localized supergravity solution for
the fundamental string ending on d3-brane [34]:

(14)

where the harmonic functions hf and h3 respectively associated with the fundamental
string and the d3-brane are given by

hf = 1 +

qf

[|~x  ~x0|2 + 4q3|~z  ~z0|]3 , h3 =

q3

|~z  ~z0|

.

(15)

note, in the above two overall transverse directions are delocalized (i.e. ~z and ~z0 in the above
harmonic functions are 3-vectors) so that the fundamental string can be localized along the
worldvolume directions of the d3-brane.

in the einstein-frame, in which the sl(2, r) symmetry is explicitly manifest in the

type-iib supergravity action, the spacetime metric takes the following form:

(16)

in order to construct the supergravity solution corresponding to the 1/2 bps bi dyon,
we apply the sl(2, r) s-duality transformation of the type-iib supergravity. we follow
the prescription discussed in ref. [45]. before one applies the sl(2, r) transformation
(13) to the supergravity solution (14) for the fundamental string ending on the d3-brane,
one has to rst modify the charge qf of the fundamental string by multiplying it with an
arbitrary constant, i.e. qf  q(q1,q2)  
(q1,q2)qf , for the purpose of recovering the charge
quantization condition [6369] after the sl(2, r) transformation.

1
2

we choose the following sl(2, r) matrix for the transformations:

 = 12 = (cid:18) e/2 e/2

e/2 (cid:19)(cid:18) cos   sin 
cos  (cid:19)

sin

= (cid:18) e cos  +  sin  e sin  +  cos

(cid:19) e/2.

(17)

the transformation by an so(2) matrix 2, which is the most general sl(2, r) matrix that
preserves the asymptotic value m = i (or  = i) of the scalar matrix m, on the solution
(14) results in the supergravity solution for a non-threshold bound state of the fundamental
string and the d-string ending on the d3-brane with the asymptotic value m = i of the
scalar m. the subsequent transformation on the transformed solution by the matrix 1
leads to the solution with an arbitrary asymptotic value m (or  =  + ie) for the
scalar elds.
by demanding that the sl(2, r) transformed charges q(1) and q(2) for the fundamental

string and the d-string to be quantized, i.e.

q(1) = (e
q(2) = e

(q1,q2)qf =: q1qf ,

from this, one determines the expression for the arbitrary constant (q1,q2) to be

(20)

the sl(2, r) transformed charges (q(1), q(2)) = (q1qf , q2qf ) of the fundamental string
and the d-string satisfy the charge quantization condition.

the nal form of the sl(2, r) transformed solution in the einstein frame describing
the non-threshold bound state of the fundamental string and the d-string ending on the
d3-brane with arbitrary asymptotic values for the scalars is as follows:

from the above expression for , one has the following forms for the axion  and the dilaton

(22)

(23)

here, the harmonic functions, which describe the non-threshold bound state of the funda-
mental string and the d-string localized on the worldvolume of the d3-brane, are given
by

h(q1,q2) = 1 +

where q(q1,q2) = 1/2

(q1,q2)qf .

note, this solution has all the parameters of the 1/2 bps bi dyon, namely ~x0 that
is related to the location of the bi dyon in the d3-brane worldvolume and (q1, q2) that
are related to the electric and the magnetic charges of the bi dyon. note also that the
parameter q(m,n) in the expression for x in eq.
(9) is related to q(q1,q2) in the above
harmonic function h(q1,q2) for the (q1qf , q2qf )-string. this is related to the fact that the
magnitude of the scalar charge (of the scalar x in eq. (9)) can be identied with the tension
of the attached string, i.e. the above (q1qf , q2qf )-string. the direction along which the
(q1qf , q2qf )-string stretches is the direction associated with the worldvolume scalar x.

by applying the iia/iib t -duality transformations on the solution (21) along the over-
all transverse directions zi, one obtains partially localized supergravity solutions that corre-
spond to new class of non-threshold bound state bi solitons. before one applies the t -duality
transformations, one has to rst delocalize the solution along those directions, i.e. one has
to compactify the t -dualized directions on circles. note, however that two of the overall
transverse directions of the solution (21) are already delocalized for the purpose of localizing
the string on the worldvolume of the d3-brane. the resulting supergravity solution has the
following form:

the solution describes the non-threshold bound state of the fundamental string (with the
longitudinal coordinate y and the associated harmonic function h1) and the d(1 + n)-brane
(with the longitudinal coordinates (y, u1, ..., un) and the associated harmonic function h1+n)
ending on the d(3 + n)-brane (with the longitudinal coordinates (x1, x2, x3, u1, ..., un) and
the associated harmonic function h3+n).

from this solution, one can see the existence of the 1/2 bps non-threshold bound state
of an electric bion and a magnetic bion under the worldvolume u(1) gauge eld of the
(3 + n)-dimensional dbi theory. such magnetic bion is related to the self-dual string [8] in
the worldvolume of the m5-brane through the dimensional reduction (along the worldvolume
direction transverse to the self-dual string) and the iia/iib t -dualities (in the transverse
directions). also, the electric bion has the same origin in the m5-brane worldvolume: for
this case, the longitudinal direction of the self-dual string is compactied. one can think
of such non-threshold bound states of the electric and magnetic bions in the d(3 + n)-
brane worldvolume as being originated from the self-dual string soliton in the m5-brane
worldvolume wrapped around a tilted circle (at angle with respect to the longitudinal and
a transverse direction) [70,8], followed by the iia/iib t -duality transformations.

in the string frame, the above solution (25) takes more recognizable form. after re-
dening the scalar asymptotic values such that the resulting spacetime metric in the string
frame is asymptotically at and then applying the weyl-rescale transformation of the metric
gstr

m n = e/2gm n , one obtains the following string frame form of the spacetime metric:

c. supergravity solution for the threshold bound state bi dyon

the bulk spacetime conguration counterpart to the threshold bound state of electric
bions and magnetic bions is the orthogonal fundamental and d strings ending on d3-brane
with the following conguration:

d1 :    4

(28)

in the string frame, such conguration is described by the following supergravity solution,
which is the bulk counterpart to the general bi dyon in eq. (5):

where the harmonic functions satisfy the following coupled dierential equations:

~z h1 + h32

~z h3 + h12

~xhf + h12
~xh1 + hf 2
uh3 + hf 2

uhf = 0,
y h3 = 0,
y h3 = 0,

along with the constraints

uhf yhp = 0,

yh3~xhf = 0,

uh3~xh1 = 0.

(29)

(30)

(31)

the constraints (31) can be satised when the solution (29) is delocalized along y and u
directions. with this choice, the fundamental strings and the d-strings become completely
localized at the d3-brane. in this case, the coupled dierential equations (30) satised by
the harmonic functions reduce to

2
~z hf + h32

~xhf = 0,

2
~z h1 + h32

~xh1 = 0,

2
~z h3 = 0.

(32)

one can solve these coupled dierential equations by following the procedure discussed in
ref. [34]. since the dimensionality of the overall transverse space is 4, one has to delocalize
one of the overall transverse directions in order for the fundamental string and the d-string
to be localized along the worldvolume directions of the d3-brane. the expressions for the
harmonic functions have the following forms:

hf = 1 +

h1 = 1 +

note, these localized harmonic functions contain all the parameters of the electric bions
and the magnetic bions in the worldvolume of the d3-brane. namely, the electric and
magnetic charges qi and pi of the bions (5) are related to the charges qf i and qd i of the
fundamental strings and the d strings, and the locations xi and yi of the electric bions and
the magnetic bions are related to the locations ~xf 1 i and ~xd1 i of the fundamental strings
and the d strings in the d3-brane worldvolume directions.

as in the case of the threshold bound state bi dyon solution (5), when nf = nd
and ~xf 1 i = ~xd1 i the solution (29) describes the threshold bound state of dyonic strings
with the ns-ns and r-r two-form charges (qf i, qd i) stretched in the qf iey + qd ieu
directions. here, ey and eu are respectively the unit vectors in the y and u directions. since
these dyons are at angle with respect to the y and u coordinates, there has to be non-zero
o-diagonal term gstr
uy indicating rotation of the dyonic strings in the uy-plane. but the
above supergravity solution lacks such term, because the solution is delocalized along those

11

directions. such o-diagonal term is expected to appear in the fully localized solution with
more general metric ansatz. the particular case in which both of the harmonic functions hf
and h1 have two centers corresponds to the bulk spacetime counterpart conguration to
the string junction discussed in the previous section. as a string approaches the d3-brane,
it splits into two strings.

by applying the iia/iib t -duality transformations along the overall transverse directions
of the solution (29), one obtains the following supergravity solution for the fundamental
string and the dp-brane ending on the d(p + 2)-brane:

from this supergravity solution, one infers that there should exist the 1/4 bps threshold
bound state of an electric bion and a magnetic bion under the worldvolume u(1) gauge eld
of the 4-dimensional dbi theory. this solution is originated from the two intersecting self-
dual strings on the m5-brane worldvolume [39] through the dimensional reduction along the
longitudinal direction of one of the self-dual strings. the corresponding bulk spacetime
counterpart conguration is

the two worldvolume self-dual strings are respectively stretched along the 4 and 5 directions
of the m5-brane worldvolume. after compactifying either 4 or 5 on a circle, one obtains the
above ten-dimensional conguration describing the fundamental string and the d2-brane
ending on the d4-brane. the corresponding worldvolume conguration is the threshold
bound state of the (electric) 0-brane and the (magnetic) 1-brane in the d4-brane dbi
theory. the supergravity solution for the fundamental string and the dp-brane ending on
the d(p + 2)-brane with p > 2, which is related to the conguration (36) through the
dimensional reduction and the iia/iib t -dualities, also implies existence of the 1/4 bps
threshold bound state of electric bion (0-brane) and a magnetic bion ((p 1)-brane) under
the worldvolume u(1) gauge eld of the (p+3)-dimensional dbi theory of the d(p+2)-brane.
