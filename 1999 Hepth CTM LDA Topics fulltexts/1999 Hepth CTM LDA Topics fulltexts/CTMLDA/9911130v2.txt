abstract

a study of the partition function of a 3-dimensional scalar-vector
model formally related via duality to the rozansky-witten topological
-model is presented. the partition function is shown to consist of such
topological quantities of a 3-dimensional manifold m like a lattice sum,
the reidemeister-ray-singer torsion r(m) and the massey product.

1 introduction

a twisted (topological) version of 3d n = 4 susy -model with a hyper-
kahler manifold as a target space (rw model) has been analysed in detail by

rozansky and witten in [1] (see, also [2] and [3]). in this letter, we will consider

a scalar-vector (sv) -model with one variable dualized. more precisely, it

consists of three scalar elds and one vector eld which is dual to one out of four

scalar elds appearing in rw -model. our sv model can be interpreted as a

variant related to low-energy version of 3d n = 4 susy su(2) gauge model
(casson theory), or 3d n = 4 susy abelian one with a matter hypermultiplet
(3d seiberg-witten theory), or as a stand-alone model as well.

as our target space. in this metric, we can perform a duality transformation

for one scalar eld, which replaces this eld by a vector eld [4] in rw action.

since x 4 is not, in general, hyper-kahlerian our sv model is not a priori

topological.

we work on a 3-dimensional euclidean manifold m and denote local coor-
dinates on m as x,  = 1, 2, 3. m is endowed with a metric tensor h. the
bosonic scalar elds can be described as functions i, i = 1, 2, 3 with a metric

tensor gij on the target space x. the fermions are a scalar i and a one-form

i

, where i = 1, 2.

2 the classical contribution

let us consider classical contribution to the partition function coming from

u(1) gauge eld a, i.e. the contribution of classical saddle-points [5], [6]

es[acl].

zcl = xsaddle

(3)

when the three-manifold m has non-trivial homology two-cycles i, i.e. closed
surfaces that are not boundaries, there exist eld congurations with non-zero

ux through these surfaces, that must obey generalized dirac quantization

condition

f = 2mi ,

where i = 1, . . . , b2(m)(= dimh2(m), the second betti number). this tells
us that in the absence of sources f can be written as

f = 2xi

mi i ,

(5)

where i is an integral basis of harmonic 2-forms, which by denition satisfy

di = d i = 0 and are normalized so that r i j = i

points are labelled by the integer magnetic uxes mi . the classical action for

j . the classical saddle-

the zero modes of the vector eld are tangent to the space of classical

minima, which is a torus of dimension b1(m). the classical part should involve
also integration over the b1-torus.

the minima of the action corresponding to the scalar eld i are the con-

stant maps of m to x. so we will expand around those according to [1]. to
take into account the bosonic zero modes one must introduce collective coor-

dinates and integrate over the space of all constant maps of m to x. thus,
we split the bosonic eld i into a sum of a constant and uctuating part,

i
0 + i(x).

(9)

we dene a partition function zx(m; i
function zx(m) as an integral over the three-dimensional target space x

0, and obtain the partition

3 the one-loop contribution

let us rst determine the one-loop contribution z0(m; i
part of the action which is quadratic in the vector eld a(x), in uctuating

0). we work with the

bosonic elds i(x) and in fermionic elds i(x), i

(13)

(14)

it will appear that the partition function z0 corresponding to (14) es-

sentially consists of the reidemeister-ray-singer torsion of 3d manifold m.
namely,

z0(m; i

0) = z [dy ]exp{s 

0[y ]} ,

(15)

where the integration measure [dy ] is taken over all the elds: a, i, i,
i
, c, c. the path integral of the scalar bosonic and ghost elds gives a net

contribution

(det(0)) 1

2 ,

(16)

where i =  (i = 0, 1) is a laplacian acting on i-forms on m and the
prime means that we exclude zero modes. now let us introduce an operator

l which acts on the direct sum of zero- and one-forms on m [1]

l(, ) =  , + h

the fermionic one-loop contribution with zero modes removed is [7]

the partition function is plagued by zero modes, which we have temporarily

removed by hand. there are the following four sorts of zero modes:

(1) 3 scalar boson zero modes corresponding to i;

(2) b1 vector boson zero modes of a;

(3) 1 ghost zero mode for c, c;

(4) 2 scalar fermion zero modes of i and 2b1 one-form fermion zero modes

of i
.

the ghost zero mode can be removed instantaneously without any conse-

quences because it should not be present in the partition function from the very

beginning at all, as the gauge transformation corresponding to the constant

(zero) mode acts trivially on a. the rest of boson and fermion zero modes

have been shifted from the one-loop calculation as they would produce trivial

innities and zeros in the partition function respectively. actually, the boson

6

zero modes have been already dealt withi

0-integration for  and b1(m)-
torus integration for a. the fermion zero modes will saturate higher-order

loops.

the propagators in our model are of the following form:

di(x)j(y)e = hgijg(0)(x, y),

(x)j (y)e = hij g(0)(x, y),
di

 (x, y) =

hij h1/2hg(1)

(25)

where g(i)(x, y) is an inverted laplacian for i-forms with zero modes removed.

5 feynman diagrams

let us analyse higher-order perturbative calculation, thus the diagrams that

have a chance to absorb the fermionic zero modes. we may limit our attention

to only those feynman diagrams (analogously to [1]), whose contribution is of

order hs, because the rest of diagrams is equal to zero.

let us consider a diagram with v vertices, v = v0 + v1 + v2 + v3, where vn

(n = 0, 1, 2, 3) means the number of vertices with n (fermionic) legs of type .

let l be the total number of legs. each vertex in the diagram carries a factor

of h1, so the vertices taken together bring a factor hv . each propagator

carries a factor of h, and each fermionic zero mode carries a normalization

factor of h

1

2 . therefore the total contribution of propagators and external legs

is h

l

2 . so we get

l
2  v = s,

7

(26)

where

s =

3
2

+

b1
2 

1
2

=

b1
2

+ 1,

(27)

which follows from the previous section. to narrow searching procedure it

is also necessary to take into account some inequalities among numbers of

vertices:

l  3v0 + 4(v1 + v2 + v3),
v1 + v3  2,
v1 + 2v2 + 3v3  2b1,

(28)

which, in turn, imply the following conditions for the feynman diagrams:

1  v0 + v1 + v2,
v3  2v0 + v1 + 2v2,
4  2v0 + 3v1 + 2v2 + v3.

this set of inequalities yields exactly seven dierent solutions (types of

feynman diagrams). six of them vanish because of parity symmetry, or be-

cause of geometrical identities for (harmonic) one-forms:    = 0, and
d = 0. the only exception is the feynman diagram (surviving for b1(m) = 2)
with v3 = 2, where the vertices are connected by a single hi propagator (all
remaining legs absorb the zero modes of i and i
)

gd3i

(30)

so the contribution of the above feynman diagram to the partition function

of our scalar-vector model is equal

z(m, x) =

1
2

a(x)i(m).

(31)

finally, the partition function of the scalar-vector model has the following form

zx(m) =

1
2

z0(m)a(x)i(m),

(32)

where z0(m) is given by eq.(21).

6 summary

for sv -model the partition function has been exactly calculated on the

three-dimensional manifold m giving the following topological quantities: a
lattice sum containing the metric on the space of harmonic two-forms, the

reidemeister-ray-singer torsion r(m) and the massey product. the lattice
sum is of classical origin, whereas the torsion is coming from the one-loop con-

tribution (functional determinants without zero modes). almost all higher-

order loops are killed by fermion zero modes, and the only one feynman

diagram surviving (for b1(m) = 2) yields the massey product.

we should stress that sv -model discussed in the present paper is not

equivalent to rw model. first of all, although sv action can be obtained

9

from rw action via duality, the duality performed, as a purely local operation

transfers no global/topological information between the models. besides, the

hyper-kahlerian condition is relaxed in our case, and a priori the model is not

topological. furthermore, a posteriori, the non-equivalence of both perturba-

tive calculi is visible.
