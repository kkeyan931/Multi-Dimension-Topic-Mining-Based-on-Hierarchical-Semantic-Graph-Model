abstract

the notion of the integral over the anticommuting grassmann variables is applied to
analyze the fermionic structure of the 2d ising model with quenched site dilution. in
the n -replica scheme, the model is explicitly reformulated as a theory of interacting
fermions on a lattice. for weak dilution, the continuum-limit approximation implies
the log-log singularity in the specic heat near tc. 1

introduction

the site dilution provides, probably, the simplest way to realize quenched disorder in real
magnetic materials. in this case, some amount of the magnetic atoms in a sample, chosen
at random, are replaced by nonmagnetic impurity atoms. another sort of disorder is bond
dilution, in which case some of the lattice bonds are assumed to be broken. the two-
dimensional ising model (2dim) is a natural object to analyze the eects of disorder on
ferromagnetic phase transition since the exact analytic solution is known for this model
in the pure case [1]. the disordered 2d ising model already has been analyzed during
the last decades both by theoretical tools and in the precise monte-carlo experiments
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. the theoretical studies were merely concerned with the case of bond
dilution, making use of the fermionic interpretation of the problem [3, 4, 5].
in this
report, we apply a new anticommuting path integral technique [7, 8, 9] to clarify the
fermionic structure of the 2dim with quenched site dilution [10]. at the rst stage, the
partition function with xed dilution is transformed into a fermionic gaussian integral.
the averaging over the disorder within the n -replica scheme then results a lattice fermionic
theory with interaction. unexpectedly, the interaction in the exact lattice theory appears
to be of order 2n in fermions, where n  0 is the number of replicas [10]. an eective
four-fermion interaction arises, however, in a continuum-limit eld theory responsible for
the critical behaviour near tc for weak dilution due to the interplay of the short-wave
and long-wave lattice fermionic modes as we pass to the continuum limit. in particular,

this implies the double-logarithmic singularity in the specic heat near tc for weak site
dilution. the question about the eects of strong and moderated dilution, however, still
remains to be an important open problem in the 2d ising model, this holds true for both
site and bond dilution.

2 the model

let us start with a xed distribution of the nonmagnetic sites over a lattice (xed site
dilution). the ising spins, mn = 1, are located at lattice sites, mn, with m, n =
1, 2, ..., l running in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. here l is the
lattice length, l  . to introduce site dilution, we accompany each ising spin by a
random variable ymn = 0, 1. the hamiltonian is [10]:

 h {y | } = xmn

[ b1 ymnym+1nmnm+1n + b2 ymnymn+1mnmn+1] ,

(1)

where b1,2 = j1,2 are the bond coupling parameters, j1,2 are the exchange energies,
 = 1/kt is the inverse temperature. we assume ferromagnetic case: b1,2 > 0. noting the
identity for a typical bond weight: exp (b yy) = cosh(b yy) + yy sinh(b yy), which
readily follows from  = 1 and yy = 0, 1, the partition function can be written in the
form: z { y } = r { y } q { y }, where r{y} is a nonsingular spin-independent prefactor, to
be ignored in what follows, and q{y} is the reduced partition function [10]:

q{y} = sp

() ymn

(1 + t1 ymnym+1nmnm+1n)(1 + t2 ymnymn+1mnmn+1) ,

(2)

where t1,2 = tanh b1,2 and a properly normalized spin averaging is assumed. since we
are interesting in quenched disorder, we have to average the free energy rather than the
partition function itself. the standard device to avoid the averaging of the logarithm is
the replica trick:

f q { y } = ln q{ y } = lim
n0

1
n

(qn {y}  1) .

(3)

in this scheme, we take n identical copies of the original partition function and average
q n {y} . the formal limit n  0 to be performed at nal stages. in what follows, we
assume the simplest distribution of the impurities in the denition of the averaging:

w (ymn) = p  (1  ymn) + (1  p)  (ymn) ,

(4)

where ( ) are the correspondent kroneckers symbols, p is the probability that any given
site, chosen at random, is occupied by the normal ising spin, while 1  p is the probabilty
that the given site is dilute.

3 fermionic interpretation

the partition function with xed disorder (2) can be transformed into a gaussian fermionic
integral 2 following the method of the mirror-ordered factorization for the density ma-
2 the rules of the integration over the purely anticommuting (grassmann) variables were rst intro-
duced by f.a. berezin [7]. in a close analogy with the bosonic case, a gaussian fermionic integral of any
kind can be expressed in terms of the determinant of the associated matrix [7]. for a short comment about
the gaussian fermionic integrals also see [11, 12].

where cmn, cmn are grassmann variables, y 2

integrals (5) and (6) are completely equivalent to each other and to (2). the advantage
of the reduced representation like (6) is that the corresponding action, in the pure case,
explicitly illuminates the majorana-dirac structures of 2dim already at the lattice level
[10].

the averaging of (6) over the disorder within the n -replica scheme, see (3) and (4),

all sites, and  ()

prefactor before the exponential, another possible choice is:  ()
mn1 [10].
the continuum-limit eld theory for weak dilution that follows from (7) is commented
in the next section. a relatively simple form of interaction in (7) also provides grounds
to try the cases of strong and moderated dilution, starting directly with the exact lattice
integral (7). the analysis of this kind, however, have not yet been performed.

4 the gross-neveu model (n  0)

to extract the eective continuum-limit eld theory from (7), we have to distinguish
explicitly the higher- and low-momentum lattice fermionic modes (fourier-harmonics) in
the exact lattice action (7).
integrating out the higher-momentum modes in the rst

elimination of the spin variables, it is then possible to express the partition function in terms of the purely
i. in fact, the mixed factors like h | ai, arising by inserting the fermions, are neither
fermionic factors, ha | a
commuting nor anticommuting with each other. so, one have to invent a special ordering for these factors,
in their global products, in order the elimination of spin variables be really possible [8, 9]. in particular,
the ordering problem is an obstacle to deal with the 3d ising model. in two dimensions, however, the
method is simple [8, 9]. following this way, we come to (5) [10].

order of perturbation theory (weak dilution), we obtain an eective action for the low-
momentum elds (large distances). the eective action appears, nally, in the form of
the n -colored gross-neveu model (n  0) [10]:

where 1, 2 are the anticommuting majorana components, mn and gn are the eective
mass and charge, respectively. here hai and hbi are some lattice fermionic averages
(short distances) explicitly calculated in [10]. the gaussian part in (8) is the replicated
majorana action, corresponding to the pure case, with the mass term modied by disorder.
the n = 0 g-n model similar to (8) already has been analyzed intensively by dd-ssl
as an eective theory near tc for weak bond dilution [3, 4, 5, 13]. the predictions are
the double-logarithmic singularity in the specic heat and the logarithmic corrections in
other thermodynamic functions. for more details see [4, 5, 14, 15]. the present analysis
thus conrms the idea of the universality for small amount of impurities in the 2d ising
ferromagnets, for weak dilution. the situation is less evident, however, for strong and
moderated site and/or bond dilution [6, 14, 15].

5 added note

let f (c1, c2, ..., cn ) be any function of grassmann variables c1, c2, .., cn . from the basic
rules of fermionic integration, it follows:

z dcn ...dc2dc1 f (1c1, 2c2, ..., n cn )
= 12...nz dcn ...dc2dc1 f (c1, c2, ..., cn ) .

(9)

innite series of related identities also follows by dierentiating (9) with respect to the
parameters 1, 2, ..., n . in particular, applying these ideas to the integral (7), we obtain
the identity:

1

l 2 xmn d s ()

mn + 1p

p e ()

mn

n

q=1

mn c ()
c ()

mn e ()

mne = 1 ,

(10)

where the averaging is assumed to be taken with respect to the non-gaussian fermionic
measure from (7). this identity can be used to check the consistency of approximations
of any kind when dealing with lattice theory (7). in a sense, the equation (10) can be

viewed as the analog of (cid:10)p2/2m(cid:11) = /2,  = kt , for the kinetic energy of a particle in

classic maxwell gas (one degree of freedom). in any case, the later identity readily follows
by exactly the same method.
