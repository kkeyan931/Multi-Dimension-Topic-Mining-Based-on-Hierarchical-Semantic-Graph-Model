abstract

we introduce and study one parameter family of integrable quantum eld theo-
ries. this family has a lagrangian description in terms of massive thirring fermions
,  and charged bosons ,  of complex sinh-gordon model coupled with bcn
ane toda theory. perturbative calculations, analysis of the factorized scatter-
ing theory and the bethe ansatz technique are applied to show that under duality
transformation, which relates weak and strong coupling regimes of the theory the
fermions ,  transform to bosons and ,  and vive versa. the scattering ampli-
tudes of neutral particles in this theory coincide exactly with s-matrix of particles
in pure bcn toda theory, i.e. the contribution of charged bosons and fermions to
these amplitudes exactly cancel each other. we describe and discuss the symmetry
responsible for this compensation property.

1 introduction

duality plays an important role in the analysis of statistical and quantum eld theory
(qft) systems. it maps a weak coupling region of one theory to a strong coupling region
of the other and makes it possible to use perturbative and semiclassical methods for the
study of dual systems in dierent regions of the coupling constants. for example, the well-
known duality between the sine-gordon and massive thirring models [1] plays a crucial
role for study of many two-dimensional quantum systems. the phenomenon of electric-
magnetic duality in four-dimensional gauge theories, conjectured in [2] and developped in
[3] opens the possibility for the non-perturbative analysis of the spectrum and the phase
structure in supersymmetric yang-mills theory.

known for many years the phenomenon of duality in qft still looks rather mysterious
and needs further study. this analysis essentially simplies for two-dimensional integrable
relativistic theories. these qfts besides the lagrangian formulation possess also an
unambiguous denition in terms of factorized scattering theory (fst). the fst, i.e. the
explicit description of the spectrum of particles and their scattering amplitudes, contains
all information about qft. these data permit one to use non-perturbative methods for
the analysis of integrable qft and makes it possible in some cases to justify the existence
of two dierent (dual) representations for the lagrangian description of the theory. an
interesting example of duality in two-dimensional integrable systems is the weak coupling
- strong coupling ow from the ane toda theories (att) to the same theories with
the dual ane lie algebra [4]. the duality in rank r non-simply laced atts coupled
with massive thirring model was studied in [7]. it was shown there that dual theory can
be formulated as the non-linear sigma-model with wittens euclidian black hole metric
[6] (complex sinh-gordon theory) coupled with non-simply laced atts. lie algebras of
these dual atts belong to the dual series of ane algebras but have the smaller rank
r = r  1.
in this paper in section 2 we consider one-parameter family of integrable qft, which
has the lagrangian formulation in terms of complex fermion eld (, ), complex bo-
son eld (, ) and n scalar elds  = (1, ..., n). this qft possesses u(1)  u(1)
symmetry generated by fermion and boson charges q and q. it can be considered as
bcn att coupled with massive thirring and complex sinh-gordon (csg) [5] models. in
the weak coupling region this qft admits a perturbative analysis. there the spectrum
of particles, besides the charged fermions (, ) and bosons (, ), contains the scalar
neutral particles ma with the masses characteristic for the bcn att. perturbative cal-
culations show that classical mass ratios are not destroyed by quantum corrections and
that charged particles possess non-diagonal scattering. the scattering amplitudes of the
charged particles can be expressed through the solution of factorization (yang-baxter)
equation. the perturbative analysis together with u(1) u(1) symmetry x this solution
up to one parameter, which depends on the coupling constant.
in section 3 we introduce the external eld a coupled with charges q and q. we
use standard bethe ansatz (ba) technique to nd the exact relation between the coupling
constant and parameter of fst. we show that in the strong coupling regime the behavior
of fermions  in the external eld is similar to the behavior of weakly coupled bosons 

2

and vice versa. the resulting fst possesses the property of self-duality together with
fermion-boson transformation   . another remarkable property of this qft is the
exact coincidence of the scattering amplitudes sab of neutral particles ma with s-matrix
of pure bcn att. it means that fermion and boson contributions to these amplitudes
exactly cancel each other. in the last section we describe and discuss the symmetry which
is responsible for this compensation property.

2 integrable deformation of bcn toda theory and

factorized scattering theory

in this section we consider the qft which can be described by dirac fermion ,

complex scalar eld  and n scalar elds  = (1, ..., n) with the action :

the last term  m 2

22 exp(2n) in (1) plays the role of usual contact counterterm
which cancels divergencies coming from fermion loop. with this term the action (1) has
the form of bcn ane toda theory coupled with massive thirring and csg [5] models.
following the notations of ref.
it possesses
u(1)  u(1) symmetry, generated by the charges

[7] we denote this qft as bcn(, , ).

(2)

the qft (1) is integrable.

it possesses the local integrals ps with odd (lorentz)
integer spins s. the explicit form of these integrals is not in the scope of this paper.
some additional symmetry of bcn(, , ) model generated conserved charges with half-
integer spin s = n + 1
2 is described in the last section. we also checked at the tree level
that multiparticles amplitudes factorize into two-particle ones.

for small  we can use the perturbation theory for the analysis of qft (1). its spec-
trum contains charged fermions (, ), charged bosons (, ) with mass m and neutral
particles ma, a = 1, ..., n.
in one loop approximation the mass ratios in bcn(, , )
theories are not destroyed by the quantum corrections and have the classical values :

ma = 2m sin(

a
h

);

a = 1, ..., n;

(3)

here and later h = 2n + 1.

the scattering theory in integrable theory (1) is completly dened by a two particle
s-matrix. the non-diagonal scattering is possible only between the particles , , ,  of

3

equal mass. all other amplitudes sa, sa and sab are the pure phases. the scattering
matrix of charged particles with u(1) u(1) symmetry (  ei,   ei) and c, p, t
invariance is characterized by the following amplitudes :

|(1)(2) >in= s()|(2)(1) >out ;
|(1)(2) >in= ()|(2)(1) >out + ()|(2)(1) >out ;
|(1)(2) >in= ()|(2)(1) >out + ()|(2)(1) >out ;
|(1)(2) >in= t()|(2)(1) >out + r()|(2)(1) >out

|(1)(2) >in= s()|(2)(1) >out ;

(4)

|(1)(2) >in= t()|(2)(1) >out + r()|(2)(1) >out

+ ()|(2)(1) >out +()|(2)(1) >out ;

+ ()|(2)(1) >out + ()|(2)(1) >out .

all the amplitudes (4) depend on rapidity dierence  = 12. they satisfy the following
crossing symmetry condition :

s(i  ) = t(); s(i  ) = t(); r(i  ) = r();
r(i  ) = r(); (i  ) = (); (i  ) = (); (i  ) = ().

(5)

the perturbative expansion for these amplitudes in the rst order in 2 has the form:

i2

4h (cid:20)h coth(cid:16) h

(6)

factorization property imposes non-trivial limitations to the scattering amplitudes.
they should satisfy the functional yang-baxter (factorization) relations. there are two
types of c, p, t invariant solutions of yang-baxter equations with u(1) u(1) symmetry.
the rst one corresponds to the case s = s and is expressed through the direct product
of two sine-gordon s-matrix. it follows from eq. (6) that in the bcn(, , ) model is
realized another case s 6= s. the solution of the factorization equation with this

4

property possesses one (besides scale of ) arbitrary parameter x and has the form :

s() = 

sinh( + ix)

cosh(  ix)

the solution (7) is consistent with crossing symmetry (5) only if

function yn() satises the unitarity and crossing symmetry relations :

yn()yn() =

; yn() = yn(i  ).

the minimal solution of eqs. (9) is known [8] and has the form :

.

(10)

in particular the amplitudes s and s which are the pure phases can be represented as :

 s() = exp(cid:20)iz 
s() = exp(cid:20)iz

(cid:21).

sin(/h) cosh(/2)

sin(/h) cosh(/2)

(11)

we note that function yn() is invariant under the transformation x  1  x. s-matrix
(7) is invariant under this transformation together with fermion-boson transformation
  .

for small x function yn() has the expansion :

yn() = 1 

2ix

h sinh 

+ o(x2).

(12)

we can see that small x expansion of amplitudes (7) coincides with perturbative expansion
(6) if

x =

2
4(cid:16)1 + o(2)(cid:17).

(13)

the amplitudes (7) possess poles at the physical strip 0 < im <  which are located

at the points a, where :

a = i(1 

2a
h

),

a = 1, ..., n.

(14)

these poles correspond to the neutral bound states ma with masses (3). the scattering
amplitudes sa, sa, sab including these particles can be obtained by the usual fusion
procedure. for this purpose it is convenient to represent the particles ma in the form :

ma() = ( +

(15)

and use for the particles (), () the commutation relations with s-matrix (7). in this
way we obtain the following expression for the amplitudes sa, sa :

sa() = sa() = s( +

in particular the amplitudes s1 = s1 can be written as :

s1() = s1() =

sinh   i cos((1  2x)/h)
sinh  + i cos((1  2x)/h)

sinh  + i cos(/h)
sinh   i cos(/h)

.

to describe all two particle amplitudes we introduce the notations [4] :

(z) =

sinh( 
sinh( 

2 + iz
2h )
2  iz
2h )

,

{z} =

(z  1)(z + 1)

(z  1 + 2x)(z + 1  2x)

,

then

sa = sa() =

the scattering amplitudes of neutral particles ma have the form :

(18)

(19)

(20)

the amplitudes (19), (20) are invariant under the transformation x  1  x. they also
are in agreement with rst order of perturbation theory if x has the form (13). to nd
the exact relation between parameter x and coupling constant  in action (1) we have to
use non-perturbative approach to the qft bcn(, , ).

3 non-perturbative consideration

the qft (1) possesses the symmetry u(1)  u(1) generated by the charges q and
q (2) and admits the introduction of the external elds a and a coupled with these
charges. for simplicity we consider the congurations with only one non-zero eld a
or a, which we denote as a. the hamiltonian h(h) in the external eld a has an
additional term equal to aq(aq) :

h = h0  aq ; h = h0  aq,

(21)

where h0 is the hamiltonian of the qft (1).
to nd the exact relation between x and  we calculate the specic ground state
energy e(a)(e(a)) in the limit a   from the hamiltonian and from s-matrix data.
the calculation of these asymptotics from the hamiltonian (21) follows exactly the lines
of ref. [7], where similar calculations were done, so we reproduce here the result :

e(, a  ) = 
e(, a  ) = 

2

a2(1 + 2/4)

2

,

(22)

2a2(1 + 2/4)

.

we calculate now the same values from the s-matrix using the ba approach (see for
[9]). we consider the case corresponding to the ground state energy e
example refs.
taking into account that for function e all consideration diers only by the notations
(  ). due to additional term aq every positively (negatively) charged particle
()(()) acquires the additionnal energy a(a). for a > m the ground state con-
taines a sea of positively charged particles (), which ll all possible states inside some
interval b <  < b. the distribution () of particles within this interval is deter-
minated by their scattering amplitude s(). the specic ground state energy can be
expressed through the function () as :

e(a)  e(0) = 

m

2 z b

b

cosh ()d,

(23)

where non-negative function () satises, in the interval b <  < b, the ba equation:
(24)

k(  )()d = a  m cosh ,

z b

b

where the kernel k() in (24) is related to the  scattering phase by :

k() = () 

1
2i

d
d

log s(),

(25)

and the parameter b is determinated by the boundary conditions (b) = 0.
has the form :

the fourier transform k() of the kernel (25) can be obtained from eq. (11) and

k() =

sinhh(1  x)/hi coshh(h + 2x)/hi

cosh(/2) sinh(/h)

.

(26)

7

for the function e(, a) we obtain exactly the same equations with function () sat-
isfying eq. (24), where kernel k() is related to the amplitude s by the eq. (25). the
amplitudes s and s (11) are connected by the transformation x  1  x. it means
that:

k() =

sinhhx/hi coshh(h + 2(1  x))/hi

cosh(/2) sinh(/h)

.

(27)

the main term of the asymptotics of the function e (e) at a   can be expressed

explicitly through the kernel k() (k()) by the relation [10] :

e(, a  ) = 

e(, a  ) = 

a2

2k(0)

a2

2k(0)

= 

= 

a2

2(1  x)
a2
2x

.

;

comparing eqs. (22) and (27) we nd the exact value for parameter x() :

x() =

2

4 + 2 = 1  x(cid:16) 4
 (cid:17).

(28)

(29)

the term e0 in eq. (23) is the bulk vacuum energy of qft (1). it can also be expressed

through the kernel k()(k()) by the relation :

e0 = 

m 2
8 hk,() cosh



2 |=i i1

=

m 2 sinh /h

8 sin(x/h) sin((1  x)/h)

.

(30)

the bulk vacuum energy is symmetric under the transformation   4/. it follows
from the eqs. (26), (27) and (29) that the transformation relates the function e and e :
(31)

, a).

e(, a) = e(

it means that strong coupling behavior ( >> 1) of the fermions ,  in the external
eld a coincides with weak coupling behavior ( << 1) of the bosons ,  and vice versa.
in the weak coupling region the behavior of functions e and e is rather dierent. in
this limit k() = 1 + o(2) and function e(a) can be easily calculated. as function of
 it has the smooth behavior at  << 1 and can be written in parametric form as :

e(a)  e(0) = 

a2

2(cid:18)1  2u + 2u(1  u) log(cid:18) u

2a(cid:19)2
(cid:18) m

= u(1  u).

1  u(cid:19)(cid:19) + o(2),

the kernel k() in the weak coupling limit is not trivial and has the form :

k() 

2
4h

coshh(h + 2)/hi
cosh(/2) sinh(/h)

.

8

(32)

(33)

the ba equations with the kernel (33) were studied in [7], where the function e(a)
corresponding to this kernel was calculated.
it can be also written in the parametric
form:

e(a)  e(0) = 

2a2

2 (cid:20)1  2u  hu(1  u)(cid:16)1  (cid:16) u

1  u(cid:17)2/h(cid:17)(cid:21) + o(1)

.

(34)

2a(cid:19)2
(cid:18) m

= u(1  u)(cid:16) u

1  u(cid:17)2/h

it was shown in [7] that function (34) coincides with the classical minimum of the
functional h (21), where in the weak coupling limit we can neglect the fermionic terms.
this gives us an additional test relating qft (1) and fst (7). the singular behavior
(o(1/2)) of function e reects the instability of weakly coupled bosons with respect
to introduction of external eld. the threshold behavior ( = (a  m)/m << 1) of
functions (32) and (34) is also rather dierent. the rst function has there singularity
 3/2 characteristic for fermionic particles. the second one possesses there behavior
 2 characteristic for the weak coupling limit of bosonic theory. it follows from eq. (31)
that properties of particles  and  change drasticaly under the ow from weak to strong
coupling (fermions transform to bosons and vice versa).

the scattering theory of charged particles  and  (7) is invariant under the transfor-
mation   4/ together with fermion-boson transformation   . the amplitudes
sa and sa (19) are invariant under this transformation. the amplitudes sab() of
scattering of neutral particles ma() are also self-dual. the remarkable property of the
amplitudes sab() is that with function x() dened by eq. (29) they coincide exactly
with scattering matrix of particles in pure bcn att proposed in ref. [4]. the pure bcn
att can be obtained from the qft (1) by the reduction  =  = 0. it means that all
contributions to the amplitudes sab of neutral particles coming from charged particles 
and  exactly cancel each other. this cancellation (which can be checked in perturbation
theory) can not be occasionnal. it should be a symmetry responsible for this compensation
property. we discuss this symmetry in the next section.

4 concluding remarks

the symmetry responsible for the exact compensation of fermion and boson con-
it is
tributions to the amplitudes of neutral particles should relate  and  particles.
possible only if this symmetry is generated by the conserved charges with half-integer
spins. it should also be consistent with the fst (7). one can check that this scattering
matrix commutes with the symmetry algebra tn, generated by the charges q(q) with
(lorentz) spin s equal to h/2 = n + 1/2 (n  1/2), and fermion number f . the
charges q, q, f possess the following commutation relations :

 = {q+, q} = {q, q+} = 0 ;

hf, qi = q;
{q+, q} = p h,

 = q2
q2
hf, qi = q ;
{q+, q} = ph ;

9

(35)

where ph(p h) is the right (left) component of the local integral of motion with spin h.
this local charge acts on asymptotic (in, out) states of charged particles () and ()
with the eigenvalue 2() (

()) :

2

() = (m exp )h/2 ;

() = (m exp )h/2.

(36)

the action of the operators q(q) and eif on the one-particle states are dened as :

q+|() >= ()|() > ; q+|() >= ()|() > ;
q|() >= ()|() > ; q|() >= ()|() > ;
eif|() >= eix|() > ;
eif|() >= eix|() > ;

eif|() >= eix|() > ;
eif|() >= eix|() > .

(37)

the operators q act at the same way as q with the substitution   . the action of
the charges q(q) on many particles sates can be dened from the following co-product
rules :

(q) = q  i + eif  q,
(q) = q  i + eif  q.

(38)

using eqs. (37), (38) and commutativity condition of algebra tn with s-matrix (4), we
can derive all the ratios of the amplitudes (7).

the eigenvalues of the operator exp(if ) on the states | > (| >) move from 1 (1)
at  = 0, to 1 (1) at  = . particles  () have fractional values of fermion number
equal to x() (1x()). at the self-dual point 2 = 4 the fermion numbers of particles
 and  are equal to 1/2. at this point we have the symmetry   . the amplitudes
s and s coincide and s-matrix (7) of the qft bcn(, ,4) can be expressed as the
direct product of two-particle s-matrices of sine-gordon model :

s() =

n

ya=0

sinh   i sin(a/h)
sinh  + i sin(a/h)

sn()  sn()

(39)

where sn() is s-matrix of sine-gordon model corresponding to the coupling constant
n+1(1,2,4) model consid-
sg/8 = 2
2
ered in [7]. it means that corresponding qfts also coincide at the point 2 = 4.

2n+3. the fst (39) coincides with s-matrix of c(1)

n+3/2(t ()

to construct the currents t ()

n+3/2) generating conserved charges q(q) it is
convenient to rewrite the action (1) in terms of other elds. we introduce the scalar eld
 related with the elds ,  by the usual bosonisation rules [1], and the elds 0, 0
which describe the dual representation for csg-model [7, 11]. in terms of these elds the
action (1) can be represented as :

an = z d2x (cid:20) 1

where parameters , ,  are dened by the relations :

2  2 = 4 , 2  2 = 4 ,  = 4/.

(41)

the rst three terms in (40) which we denote as a(0, 0) correspond to the rst (sigma-
model) term in the action (1). with action a(0, 0) the elds ,  and  can be
represented as :

 0

(42)

the action (40) is not available for the ordinary perturbation theory in coupling constant

, however with this action qft bcn(, ,4) can be treated as perturbed conformal

eld theory. using this approach we introduce the elds 0(0), () which are the right
(left) chiral components of elds 0, , and right (left) derivatives  = 0 + 1 ( =
0  1). the straightforward calculation shows that spin n + 3/2 ((n + 3/2)) currents
n+3/2(t ()

n+3/2 can be obtained from the eq. (43) by the substitution 0  0,

the fermion number f can be expressed through the charges q and q (2) as :

f = x()q + (1  x())q .

(44)

together with charges q and q it generates the algebra tn. it follows from the rep-
resentation (15) for the neutral particles ma() and eq. (36) that all these particles are
annihilated by the local conserved charge ph :

ph|ma1(1)...man(n) >in(out)= 0.

(45)

the neutral boson sector of the theory n, which contains only asymptotic particles ma(),
is dened by the kernel of the conserved charge ph. the restriction of the scattering theory
to the neutral sector n, denes self-consistent fst. the qft corresponding to this fst
possesses the lagrangian description with the local action, which can be obtained from
the action (1) by the reduction  =  = 0.

at the end we note that besides this reduction, the qft (1) possesses several other
integrable reductions. for example :  = 0,  6= 0;  = 0,  6= 0;  6= 0,  is real;
 6= 0,  is majorana fermion;  is real,  is majorana fermion and so on. the fsts
corresponding to these reductions are described in refs. [4, 7, 8].
