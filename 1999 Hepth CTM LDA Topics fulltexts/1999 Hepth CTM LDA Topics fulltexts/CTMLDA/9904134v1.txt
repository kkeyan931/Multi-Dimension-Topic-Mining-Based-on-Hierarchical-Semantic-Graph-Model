abstract

the weyl representation is used to analyze cliord algebras and majorana conditions in
any spacetime. an index labeling inequivalent -structures up to orthogonal conjugations is
introduced.

inequivalent charge-operators in even-dimensions, invariant under wick rotations, are con-
sidered. the hermiticity condition on free-spinors lagrangians is presented. the constraints put
by the majorana condition on the free-spinors dynamics are analyzed. tables specifying which
spacetimes admit lagrangians with non-vanishing kinetic, massive or pseudomassive terms (for
both charge-operators in even dimensions) are given. the admissible free lagrangians for free
majorana-weyl spinors are fully classied.

1 introduction.

the theory of cliord algebras is an old subject which has been extensively investigated both in
the mathematical and in the physicists literature. for obvious reasons physicists mainly dealt
with the theory of spinors in minkowskian or euclidean spacetimes [1, 2]. nevertheless in some
papers [36] spinors in pseudoeuclidean spacetimes with arbitrary signature (t, s), d = t + s
being the dimensionality of the spacetime, have been analyzed. in particular [4] can be regarded
as the reference work on the subject since it presents a rather complete list of results in this
topic.

the development of supergravities and superstring theories which emphasize the kaluza-
klein aspect of compactication to lower dimensional space led investigating properties of
spinors (and supersymmetries) in arbitrary dimensional spaces. however, apart some spe-
cial papers as the ones previously recalled, the great majority of works were still devoted to
standard-signature spacetimes. the question of providing a physical interpretation for the
extra-times somehow masked the fact that from a strictly mathematical point of view consis-
tent superstring theories can be formulated in exotic signatures (like e.g. 5 + 5). this negative
attitude towards exotic signatures seems at present time changing and their possible physical
implications nd increasing attentions (see e.g. [7]). various reasons are at the basis of this shift
of attitude. some recent works [8] for instance pointed out the existence of dualities relating
theories formulated in dierent signatures. on the other hand the still-mysterious m-theory
suggests that we need investigating along all possible directions. a rather formal argument
can also be invoked, a reasonable demand for any possible theory which could claim to be a
genuine theory of everything is that the signature of the spacetime should be determined by
the properties of the spacetime itself rather than imposed a priori. the minkowskian signature
should therefore be selected after confrontation with the other signatures.

motivated by the above considerations in this paper we analyze the real cliord structures
and majorana conditions in any signature spacetime with arbitrary dimensions. the analysis
here presented is based on the weyl realizations of cliord algebras. the technique employed
allows to recover the results of [4] in a considerably simplied manner. besides that, extra-
informations, not presented in [4], are gained. as an example discussed in the text we mention
the correct choice of the charge operator which preserves the majorana condition under a wick
rotation to the euclidean.

a list of further topics here discussed, some of them we are not aware to be found elsewhere,
is the following. an index is introduced to label and discriminate among classes of inequivalent
cliord algebras up to orthogonal conjugations. such index could in principle be relevant to
physical applications whenever some kind of reality conditions are imposed on the elds.

moreover the compatibility of the majorana condition with the free massive equations of
motion is thoroughly investigated. the conditions upon free lagrangians for majorana spinors
in order to be non-vanishing, hermitian and charge-conjugated are presented. explicit and easy-
to-consult tables of spacetimes supporting massive (or pseudomassive in the even-dimensional
case) majorana spinors are provided. the list of results here presented is more complete than

1

the one given in reference [6].

the scheme the present work is as follows: the next section is devoted to notations and
preliminary results.
in section 3 the weyl representation is introduced. even-dimensional
inequivalent charge operators, invariant under wick rotations, are constructed. the index
labeling -structures up to orthogonal conjugation is discussed in section 4. the hermiticity
condition on free-spinors lagrangians is discussed in section 5. section 6 presents an exhaustive
list of the constraints put by the majorana condition on the free-spinors dynamics, both at
the level of the equations of motion and of the action. tables specifying which spacetimes
admit lagrangians with non-vanishing kinetic, massive or pseudomassive terms (for both charge-
operators in even dimensions) are given. finally in section 7 the problem of determining the
admissible free lagrangians (kind of terms, non-vanishing conditions, type of coecients) for
majorana-weyl spinors in even-dimensional spacetimes is fully solved.

2 notations and preliminary results.

let  be the (pseudo)-euclidean metric associated to an m t,s generalized minkowski space-
time with t time-directions and s space-directions. the space-time dimension being d = t + s.
in the following we will denote as time (space) directions those which are related to the + (and
respectively ) sign in .

a -structure associated to the m t,s spacetime is a matrix-representation of the cliord

algebra generators  ( = 1, ..., d) satisfying the anticommutation relations

 +  = 2  1

(1)

the representation is realized by 2[ d
which can be further assumed to satisfy the unitarity requirement

2 ] matrices ([ d

2 ]  2[ d

2 ] denoting the integral part of d
2 )

a tracelessness condition holds

 = 1

tr = 0

(2)

(3)

for any .

according to the fundamental pauli theorem [9] the above matrix-representation is uniquely

realized up to unitary conjugation.

notice that choosing the (+) sign in the r.h.s. of (1) is a matter of convention. the
opposite choice (i.e. r.h.s.  2) is admissible. however it is just sucient to look at
results and tables obtained for an (s, t)-signature within the + convention since the results for
the  convention-case are immediately recovered by interchanging t and s: t  s. it should
be therefore clear that the complete set of solutions for (s, t) spacetimes are recovered from the
tables produced below only after such (t, s)-dualization has been taken into account.

the introduction of lagrangians and charge conjugations for the spinor elds require the
presence of three (only two of them mutually independent) unitary matrices, denoted in the

2

literature as a, b, c, associated to each one of the three conjugations (hermitian, complex-
conjugation and transposition respectively) acting on the -matrices, according to

aa = (1)t+1
bb = 
cc  = (1)t+1t

(4)

as discussed later , as well as  introduced below, is a sign (1) specifying the assignment of
a {, a, b, c} structure up to unitary transformations.  and  will be explicitly computed in
the next section. the introduction of  as dened in (4) corresponds to the standard convention
in the literature.

the equation relating a, b and c can be expressed through

c = bt a

with the transposed matrix bt satisfying

bt = b

an useful form of restating the above equation is

bb =   1

the a-matrix can be expressed through the position

a = y

i

i=1,...,t

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

where the product (the order is irrelevant since a, b, c can always be determined up to an
arbitrary phase) is restricted to time-like -matrices, i.e. those satisfying the i2 = +1 equation
(conversely the spacelike -matrices are those belonging to the complementary set satisfying
j 2 = 1).

the a-matrix allows constructing in generic at spacetimes m t,s the conjugated  spinor

as  = a, and generalizes the 0-matrix of the standard minkowskian spacetime.

the matrix c corresponds to the charge-conjugation matrix, while b is employed in intro-

ducing the charge-conjugated spinors c according to

c = b

(9)

quantum mechanical states are rays in a hilbert space. a physical spinorial state can be
equally well described by a spinor transformed via an unitary matrix u,  7 u .

it is easily proven that under such a unitary transformation , a, b, c are mapped as

follows


7 uu 
a 7 u au 
b 7 u bu 
c 7 u cu 

3

(10)

notice that the unitary transformations acting upon b, c do not coincide with their unitary
conjugations.

if we introduce the notion of a {, a, b, c}-structure assignment associated to a given
spacetime m t,s and we look for inequivalent classes of such assignments under the (10) trans-
formations, we easily realize that the ,  signs introduced above label inequivalent classes of
assignments. indeed ,  can be equivalently introduced in a unitary-invariant trace form as

tr(bb) =   tr1

tr(bb

) = d  tr1

(11)

where the convention on the repeated indices is understood.

with a slight abuse of language we can say that ,  label inequivalent choices of charge-

conjugations.

in an even-dimensional spacetime (d = 2n) we can introduce a timelike generalized 5
matrix (i.e. the matrix generalizing the one associated to the ordinary minkowskian spacetime),
through the position

3 cliord algebras and the majorana condition.

the allowed values for the signs ,  labelling inequivalent {, a, b, c}-structures associated
to any given spacetime have been computed in [4]. a very ecient and much simpler method
of computing ,  is at disposal by explicitly using a -structure in a weyl representation. the
choice of working within a weyl representation can always be done and, due to the fundamental
property that -structures are all equivalent up to unitary conjugation [9], by no means aects
the generality of the results so obtained. more than just reproducing previous results the com-
putation through a weyl representation encodes further information. indeed we will show that
weyl-represented c charge-conjugation operators are left unchanged under a wick rotation.
when inequivalent charge-conjugation operators are present the tables provided below inform
which charge-conjugations should be correctly chosen in performing analytical continuation to
lets say the euclidean space.

a weyl representation of an even-dimensional (d = 2n) -structure is dened by the
property that the  matrices are all symmetric or antisymmetric under transposition ( =

4

t ). moreover the number of symmetric equal the number of antisymmetric  matrices
(= n).

in odd dimensional spacetimes a further symmetric matrix, the 5 introduced in (12) is

presents.

a wick rotation of a timelike  direction into a spacelike direction is represented on -
matrices by the rescaling  7 i, while the remaining -matrices are left unchanged. clearly
the symmetric or antisymmetric character of the  matrix is not aected by a wick rotation.
in a weyl-represented even-dimensional -structure we can introduce two inequivalent
charge operators (i.e. realizing inequivalent {, a, b, c} assignments, see the discussion in
the previous section) cs and ca dened as follows

cs = y

is

is=1,...,n

ca = y

ia

ia=1,...,n

(15)

the products being restricted to symmetric (and respectively antisymmetric) -matrices. as in
the denition of the matrix a (8), the ordering of the products is irrelevant. please notice that
the index (s or a) labeling c reects the construction, via symmetric or antisymmetric ma-
trices, of the corresponding charge-conjugation operator and not its (anti)-symmetry property
which is expressed by formula (14). from (8) and (15) we obtain the relation ca  cs5.

clearly cs and ca are left invariant by wick rotations up to an arbitrary phase, implying

the convenience of the weyl basis in discussing such an issue.

in odd-dimensional spacetimes a charge operator c can be introduced by using both for-
mulas in (15). due to the presence in this case of the extra 5 among the symmetric matrices,
the two denitions indeed collapse into a single one (modulo an arbitrary phase), recover-
ing the well-known result that there exists a unique {, a, b, c}-assignment, up to unitary
transformations, in odd dimensions.

we recall that the a matrix is dened in (8), while bs,a are introduced from (5) as

bs,a = a  cs,a

t

(16)

if we take into account the fact that timelike -matrices are hermitian, it is just a matter
of tedious but straightforward computations to check for both (s, a)-cases, which (1)-signs
correspond to s, a, as well as s, a, introduced in the formulas (4) and (6).

in an (s, t) even-dimensional spacetime we obtain the following table

4

2

 0
6
s +  + 
a  +  +
s + +  
a +   +

where the even values characterizing the columns correspond to

x = s  t mod 8

5

(17)

(18)

a similar table can be produced for odd-dimensional spacetimes.
between the s, a-cases is produced

in this case no splitting

5

3

 1
7
  +  +
 +   +

as above the columns are marked by x given by (18).

another sign, denoted by  and important for later considerations, is introduced through

the position

(19)

where 5 is the timelike extra- matrix given in (12). we obtain

b5b = 5

2

 0
6
 +  +

(20)

(21)

here as well columns correspond to x given in (18).
the majorana reality condition on spinors is a constraint on the charge-conjugated spinor

c introduced in (9), imposed to satisfy

c = 

(22)

such a constraint can be consistently set only when  = +1 (due to the combined result of
applying the complex conjugation on (9) and the formula (7)).

one of the consequences read from the table (17) is the well-known result that majorana

spinors do not exist in the euclidean 4-dimensional space.1

the table (17) is useful for another purpose. it allows reading which choice of the cs, ca
charge-conjugation operators should be adopted to mantain a majorana reality condition if a
wick analytical continuation is performed. indeed in the 0-column both the cs and ca charge-
conjugation operators are consistent with the majorana condition. therefore e.g. the (2, 2)
spacetime supports inequivalent majorana spinors, based either on cs or on ca; conversely for
the standard (3, 1)-minkowskian spacetime the majorana condition is only dened w.r.t. cs.
recalling the property that cs, ca are left unchanged by wick rotation, it turns out that only
the (2, 2) cs-majorana spinors are wick related to the (3, 1) majorana spinors.

an euclidean space which supports majorana spinors is the 10-dimensional one. we obtain

the two following chains of wick-related majorana spinors:

:
cs
ca :

(10, 0)  (9, 1)  (6, 4)  (5, 5)  (2, 8)  (1, 9)
(0, 10)  (1, 9)  (4, 6)  (5, 5)  (8, 2)  (9, 1)

(23)

the three potentially ambiguous cases are (9, 1), (5, 5) and (1, 9) which present both kinds of
majorana spinors.

1enlarged reality conditions which are applicable when  = 1, like the su (2)-reality condition proposed

be wetterich [3], will not be discussed in the present paper.

4 inequivalent real cliord-weyl structures.

let a cliord -structure in a weyl basis be denoted a cliord-weyl structure. in this section
we provide an answer to the question: how many inequivalent real cliord-weyl structures do
exist? to provide a solution we introduce an appropriate index labeling inequivalent structures.
the mathematical formulation of the problem is better phrased as nding the classes of

equivalence of -matrices up to orthogonal conjugation

, 

7 oot

(24)

with o 2[ d

2 ]  2[ d

2 ] real-valued, orthogonal (oot = ot o = 1) matrices.

we already mentioned that the fundamental pauli theorem guarantees that -matrices are
uniquely represented up to unitary conjugation; they however t into dierent classes when
just orthogonality is concerned.

one could ask whether this well-posed mathematical problem has sensible physical conse-
quences. indeed, as far as quantum mechanics is concerned, equivalent descriptions are provided
by unitary-transformed states in a given hilbert space. however, if some reality condition has
to be imposed, it may well restrict the class of allowed transformations to be the orthogonal
ones. indeed this happens when e.g. the majorana reality condition is imposed on spinors.
later we comment more on that.

the above mathematical problem nds the following solution.
let an index i be dened for a d-dimensional (s, t)-spacetime (d = s + t) through the

position

i =

1
2([ d
2 ]+1)

 tr(

)

(25)

the sum over repeated indices is understood. the normalization is chosen for a matter of
convenience and as before [ d

2 ] denotes the integral part of d
2 .

i is clearly left invariant by orthogonal transformations (24) while it is aected by unitary
conjugations of -matrices. it can be therefore used to label inequivalent classes of -matrices
up to orthogonal conjugation.

in a weyl basis i can be easily computed. indeed, as previously recalled, in such a basis
-matrices are either symmetric or antisymmetric.  coincides with  up to a sign which
is determined by both the time-like or space-like character of the  direction, as well as the
(anti)-symmetry nature of .
it is a matter of straightforward computations to check the
following results.

i) let us consider at rst an even (d = 2n) dimensional spacetime. we denote as ta (sa)
the number of time-like (space-like) directions associated to antisymmetric -matrices. the
number of symmetric timelike (spacelike) matrices is therefore t  ta (s  sa). in a weyl basis
the equality ta + sa = n holds. for a weyl assignment with ta antisymmetric timelike matrices
the index i takes the value

let us introduce m given by m = min(s, t). we are free to choose among m + 1 dierent weyl
assignments, ta = 0, ..., m, each one leading to a dierent value for i and therefore inequivalent

i = t  2ta

(26)

7

under orthogonal conjugations. indeed we obtain m + 1 possible values for i,

 m + 2j

,

j = 0, ..., m

(27)

in the even-dimensional case.

ii) let d = 2n + 1 (s + t = 2n + 1) be an odd-dimensional spacetime (s + t = 2n + 1). an
extra (the generalized-5 matrix here denoted 2n+1) symmetric matrix is present w.r.t. the
previous case. it could be associated either to a time-like or to a space-like direction according
to the sign

2n+12 =  = 1

(28)

let as before ta be the number of antisymmetric timelike -matrices. the computation of the
index i follows the same steps. we obtain

notice that for a xed (s, t)-spacetime the parity of i is determined by the sign of :

i = t  2ta  1

2(1  )

or conversely

(1)i = (1)t

 = (1)t+i

(29)

(30)

(31)

which implies that the timelike or spacelike character of 2n+1 cannot be reverted by orthogonal
conjugations. as before let us put m = min(s, t).

 can be arbitrary chosen unless m = 0. i can assume 2m + 1 dierent values labeling

corresponding inequivalent classes. for m 6= 0 they are given by

m  2j  1
 = 1,

2(1  )

j = 0, 1, ..., m  1

2(1 + )

(32)

for m = 0 either we have i = +1 in the (2n + 1, 0) case or i = 1 in the (0, 2n + 1) case.

let us discuss now a possible application of the above construction to the majorana reality
condition. a standard result (see [4]) states that for  = 1, i.e. the consistency requirement
for the majorana condition, the b matrix introduced in (5) can be unitary-transformed (10)
to the identity matrix

u s.t. u bu  = 1

(33)

the choice b  1 corresponds to the so-called majorana representation (c = ). the
orthogonal transformations are the unitary transformations acting on b and preserving the
majorana representation

u 1u  = 1  u u t = u t u = 1

(34)

from (4) in the majorana representation we have  = , so that the index i takes the
value

i = d

8

(35)

in this particular case the information furnished by the index i is reduced to the same in-
formation provided by , . the logics behind is however dierent. ,  label inequivalent
classes under unitary transformations of a richer {, a, b, c}-structure, while i corresponds
to inequivalent classes of orthogonal transformations of just a -structure (in the majorana
realization). it deserves a careful investigation to determine whether for other choices of reality
conditions which can select physical elds (such as the su(2)-majorana condition on spinors)
the index i can rene the standard classication and be physically meaningful.
in a dier-
ent but related context we already found [10] a physical application where the index plays a
non-trivial role.

5 free hermitian actions.

the most general lagrangian involving free spinorial elds is given by

   +    +   5 +   5

(36)

the third (pseudokinetic) and the fourth (pseudomassive) term involve the 5 matrix dened
in (12) and are present in even d-dimensional spacetimes only.

the transposition acting on anticommuting elds ,  satises

(  )t = t   t

(37)

while the hermitian conjugation can be conventionally dened, without losing generality, ac-
cording to

(  ) =    

(38)

(as for the complex conjugation, it follows from (37) and (38)).

demanding the hermiticity of the action, i.e. of the (36) lagrangian, xes unambiguously
the nature, real or imaginary, of the coecients in (36). straightforward computations lead to
the table

 0
1
 r i
 r r i

 r i

2
3
i r
i
i r r
i r

i

the columns are labeled by t mod 4,

t being the number of time-like dimensions.

(39)

the table above is useful e.g.

indeed in the case of a
theory involving, lets say, massive and/or pseudomassive terms, the mass-shell condition reads
as follows

in nding mass-shell properties.

p2 =

1
2 (2  2)

9

(40)

in the (3, 1)
where , ,  enter (36). the hermiticity requirement (39) allows to set e.g.
2 is
minkowski spacetime  = i,  = m,  = im5, with m, m5 real, so that p2 = m2 + m5
necessarily positive. in a (2, 2)-spacetime we only need to change the denition of , which
must be imaginary, by setting  = im. the mass-shell condition reads p2 = m5
2  m2. a
vanishing value can be found even for m, m5 6= 0 provided that m = m5.

6 majorana constraints on the dynamics.

in this section we analyze the constraints put by the (9) majorana condition on the dynamics
of free spinors.

from the (36) lagrangian we derive the equation of motion

 +  + 5 + 5 = 0

(41)

the above equation of motion is compatible with the (9) majorana condition provided the
coecients are constrained to satisfy

 =   ()
 =   
 =   ()
 =   ()

(42)

where ,  have been introduced in (4) and (6) respectively. the common factor , as far as
the equation of motion alone is concerned, is an arbitrary phase

|  |2 = 1

(43)

the derivation of the (41) equation of motion from a lagrangian puts further constraints. each
majorana-constrained li (i = 1, ..., 4) term appearing in (36), in order to be non-vanishing,
must be symmetric, i.e.

li

t = li

(44)

for an (s, t)-spacetime (s + t = d) this so happens when the following signs assume the +1
value:

i) for the kinetic term the sign is  given by

ii) for the massive term, 

 = t+1(1)

t

2(t + 1)

 = t(1)

t

2(t  1)

iii) for the pseudokinetic term, 5

5 = (1)

d
2

10

(45)

(46)

(47)

iv) for the pseudomassive term, 5

5 = (1)

d
2

(48)

the following tables, specifying which spacetimes support the existence of non-vanishing

kinetic and massive terms, can be produced. for even-dimensional spacetimes we have


0
1, 2
s
a 0, 1
2, 3
s
a 1, 2

2
0, 1

1, 2

4

6

1, 2

2, 3

(49)

some comments are in order. the columns are labeled by x = s  t mod 8. the index
s or a is referred to the corresponding charge-conjugation (either cs or ca). the entries are
evaluated only when  = 1 (majorana consistency requirement); the s in the entries specify
for which number of t time-like directions

t =  mod 4

(50)

the sign in the associated row assumes the +1 value.

similarly, for odd-dimensional spacetimes, we have

3

5

 1
0,1

 1, 2

7
1, 2
2, 3

(51)

(same meaning for the symbols).

the next question to be answered is whether the action associated to the (36) lagrangian
admits a charge-conjugation which allows to consistently introduce the majorana condition.
this point has been raised in [6]. the existence of a charge conjugation requires

l = l

(52)

and is automatically guaranteed from the non-vanishing condition lt = l once assumed the
hermiticity of the action (l = l), i.e. when the coecients are chosen to satisfy the table
(39).

it turns out that the phase  appearing in (43) is no longer arbitrary now but xed to be

 = t

11

(53)

from the (49) and (51) tables above we can extract some particular results, e.g. that massive

lagrangians for majorana spinors exists in
i) t = 1 mod 4 spacetimes (for  = 1) when

ia) s  t = 0 mod 8 (for the ca charge-operator),
ib) s  t = 2 mod 8 (for the cs charge-operator),
ic) s  t = 1 mod 8,

as well as in
ii) t = 2 mod 4 (for  = +1) when

iia) s  t = 0 mod 8 (for the cs charge-operator),
iib) s  t = 6 mod 8 (for the ca charge-operator),
iic) s  t = 7 mod 8.
the role of s, t can be interchanged as recalled in section 2.
in the case of odd-dimensional spacetimes the table (51) provides further information. ki-

netic (k) or massive (m) terms are only allowed in d-dimensional spacetimes according to

d = 1 mod 8 {k}
d = 3 mod 8 {k, m}
d = 5 mod 8 {m}
d = 7 mod 8 {...}

(54)

up to d = 11 dimensions the list of odd-dimensional spacetimes supporting majorana spinors
is given by

{k, m} :
{k} :
{m} :
{...} :

(2, 1),
(1, 0),
(2, 3)
(7, 0),

(10, 1),
(9, 0),

(9, 2),
(8, 1),

(6, 5)
(5, 4)

(4, 3)

(55)

for even-dimensional spacetimes (up to d = 10) an useful table can be written

it contains the following informations. columns are labeled by d, rows by t. each entry is
evaluated for  = 1. the presence of s or a denotes if the corresponding charge-operator
denes a majorana spinor. the sign () represents the corresponding value of . the presence
of k, m, p denotes if the kinetic (k), massive (m) or pseudomassive (p ) term in the (36)
lagrangian can be non-vanishing. these last two terms have been evaluated only when the
corresponding kinetic term is nonzero. the pseudokinetic term has not been inserted here
since its physical interpretation is problematic (due to the presence of negative-normed states,
which however can be eliminated if projected out, as in the majorana-weyl case discussed in
the next section).

since the same results are repeated mod 8, both in s and in t, the following compact
information can be extracted. majorana spacetimes with a non-vanishing kinetic term can be
found in

d = 0 mod 8 :
d = 2 mod 8 :
d = 4 mod 8 :

{a, k}

{s, kp } or

either
{s, km p }

{a, km}

(57)

in d = 2, 10, ... either a massive or a pseudomassive term could be present, according to the
choice of the charge-conjugation operator. simultaneous presence of massive and pseudomassive
terms is allowed in d = 4, 12, ... dimensions only.

7 the majorana-weyl conditions.

in order to make this paper self-consistent we review in this section the status of majorana-weyl
spinors and present a complete list of results.

in d = 2n even-dimensional spacetimes the projectors

pr,l  (

1  5

2

)

(where 5 has been introduced in (12)) allow dening chiral (weyl) spinors r,l as

r,l = pr,l

(58)

(59)

majorana-weyl spinors, satisfying both the condition (9) and the projection (59), can be con-
sistently dened (see [4]) in spacetimes such that

s  t = 0 mod 8

(60)

therefore in particular in all (n, n) spacetimes. up to 10 dimensions the remaining spacetimes
supporting majorana-weyl spinors are the euclidean (8, 0) space and the minkowskian (9, 1)
spacetime.

in any spacetime satisfying (60) majorana-weyl spinors can be introduced for both cs and

ca charge-conjugation operators. the list of results presented below holds in both cases.

let us rst recall that  = t c under the condition (9) and that moreover the cs,a charge-
operator is respectively block-diagonal or block-antidiagonal according if n is even or odd. as
a consequence kinetic (k) and massive (m) terms can either mix (denoted in such case as
kxy, mxy) chiralities or not (kxx, mxx). we can write

and

kxx  r,l
mxx  r,l

t cr,l
t cr,l

kxy  r
mxy  r

t cl + l
t cl + l
t cr

t cr

(61)

(62)

the mixed terms kxy, mxy can always be chosen to be non-vanishing.
it is sucient for
this purpose to conveniently x the relative sign between the two terms in the r.h.s. of (62).
this is done in (62), the two signs  and  coincide with their values given in (45) and (46)
respectively.
conversely the kxx and mxx terms could be identically zero according to the (anti-)symmetry
properties of c.

let us now introduce  = (1)n. from the previous remarks on the block-character of c

we have that

k=+1  kxy
k=1  kxx

, m=+1  mxx
, m=1  mxy

(63)

the most general free lagrangian for majorana-weyl spinors in d = 2n dimensions can be
expressed as

l = k + m

(64)

the formula (63) species which kind of kinetic and which kind of massive term could appear
in d = 2n. the coecients ,  are either real or imaginary according to the table (39).

the last feature to be computed is in which dimensions the kxx, mxx terms are not iden-
tically vanishing. the nal results can be summarized in the following table, which presents
the types of allowed kinetic and massive terms in accordance with the dimensionality d of the
spacetime

d = 0 mod 8,
d = 2 mod 8,
d = 4 mod 8,
d = 6 mod 8,

{kxy}
{kxx, mxy}
{kxy, mxx}
{mxy}

(65)

the list of results presented in this section removes any possible ambiguities and completely
determines all features of the free actions for majorana-weyl spinors in any space-time.

8 conclusions.

this paper has been devoted to discuss real structures in cliord algebras and majorana
conditions in any space-time. the weyl representation for cliord algebras has been employed
to analyze -structures and majorana spinors. an index, which to our knowledge has not
been discussed before at least in the physicists literature, has been introduced. it classies
-structures up to orthogonal conjugations.

for what concerns majorana spinors, some of the issues here discussed have not been consid-
ered in previous papers. we can mention e.g. the interplay between the hermiticity condition,
the charge-conjugation and the non-vanishing condition for the (36) lagrangian. the dier-
ent role played by the even-dimensional charge operators cs, ca (15), invariant under wick
rotations, is another example.

we have furnished a series of tables presenting an exhaustive list of results concerning
majorana and majorana-weyl spinors. they include in particular the non-vanishing conditions
in any given space-time for kinetic, massive and pseudomassive terms, in association with each
charge operator cs, ca (in even dimensions), as well as the type of coecients (39) and the
kind of terms (in the majorana-weyl case) entering the free lagrangian (36).

one of our main motivations for presenting here such a systematic list of results concerns
their relevance in analyzing supersymmetries in generic pseudoeuclidean spacetimes. their
connection with supergravities, strings, brane dynamics, etc., could be explored (for a recent
review of this topic in standard minkowskian spacetimes see e.g. [11]). in the introduction we
mentioned why this issue could be important. problems like kaluza-klein compactications,
dimensional reductions, analytical continuations to the euclidean spaces, are among those which
have to be addressed.
