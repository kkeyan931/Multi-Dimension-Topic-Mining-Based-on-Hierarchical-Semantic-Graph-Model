abstract

we consider systems of non-threshold bound states (d(p2), dp), for 2 
p  6, in type ii string theories. each of them can be viewed as dp branes with
a nonzero (rank two) neveu-schwarz b eld. we study the noncommutative

eects in the gravity dual descriptions of noncommutative gauge theories for

these systems in the limit where the brane worldvolume theories decouple

from gravity. we nd that the noncommutative eects are actually due to

the presence of innitely many d(p2) branes in the (d(p2), dp) system
which play the dominant role over the dp branes in the large b-eld limit. our

study indicates that dp branes with a constant b-eld represents dynamically

the system of innitely many d(p2) branes without b-eld in the decoupling
limit. this implies an equivalence between the noncommutative yang-mills

in (p + 1)-dimensions and an ordinary yang-mills with gauge group u () in
(p1)-dimensions. we provide a physical explanation for the new scale which
measures the noncommutativity.

i. introduction

gauge theories on noncommutative spaces can arise in certain limits of string theory

[15]. for a system of dp branes, a constant neveu-schwarz (ns) b eld in spatial directions

on the worldvolume is the key to making the space noncommutative. following maldacenas

ads/cft correspondence for the usual yang-mills theory, it is quite natural to look for the

gravity duals of the noncommutative gauge theories (ncym). in order to do so, one has to

identify a limit in which closed strings decouple from the open strings which end on the dp-

branes and the dynamics for the open strings is entirely described by their low energy gauge

theory on a noncommutative space1. recently, this has been achieved in general by seiberg

and witten [6], and for special systems by hashimoto and itzhaki [7] and by maldacena

and russo [8]. the correspondence between ncym and the gravity duals is proposed in

[7,8]. this correspondence has also been studied for many other known systems recently

in [9,10]. the thermodynamics for ncym has also been studied in [8,11,12,10]. seiberg

and witten have shown that noncommutative gauge theories are equivalent to usual gauge

theories by a change of variables2. this can be understood physically by the fact that the

two descriptions are due to the dierent choices of regulator in the sigma model expansion

1we will refer to this limit as the ncym decoupling limit as opposed to the usual decoupling

limit for the ads/cft correspondence of maldacena.

2this in general does not require the two gauge groups in the respective descriptions to be the

same. rather we only need to preserve the gauge equivalence relation. in other words, whenever

two ordinary gauge elds are gauge-equivalent by an ordianry gauge transformation, we have two

corresponding gauge-equivalent noncommutative gauge elds which are related by a noncommuta-

tive gauge transformation. however, in this paper, when we talk about gauge group, we always

mean the unitary group u (n) associated with the number of d-branes dened in terms of n  n
hermitian matrices, not the one associated with the noncommutative, associative algebra dened

in terms of  product for functions, i.e., f  g = f g + (1/2)iij if jg + o(2).

2

and physics in a well-dened theory should be independent of such choices.

whether we have the usual ym or ncym depends crucially on the vanishing or the
nonvanishing of the constant worldvolume 2-form eld3 f  2f + b. here b is the ns
2-form eld and f is the worldvolume 2-form gauge eld strength. so whenever we have

a constant f -eld, we can potentially have a ncym description. for convenience, we, as
usual, make a gauge choice such that we have f = 0 while b takes the given constant value

of f .

it is well-known that the constant f eld on the worldvolume of a dp brane implies that

there are innitely long fundamental strings (for short, f-strings) and/or d(p2) branes
in the dp-brane from the spacetime perspective [1317] (actually there are innitely many

such strings or d(p2) branes). the former gives the so-called (f, dp) non-threshold bound
states [1416] while the latter gives (d(p2), dp) non-threshold bound states [13,15,17]4.
this relationship between the constant f -eld on the worldvolume of a dp-brane and the f-

strings and/or d(p2)-branes living on a dp-brane must imply a close connection between
the non-commutativity and these f-strings and/or d(p2) branes.

the aim of this paper is to reveal the connection and possible consequences of this. in

general, if there exists a non-threshold bps bound state5 consisting of p-branes and p-branes

3the constant b-eld can be taken as the asymptotic value of the ns b-eld in a gravity cong-

uration. note that our ns 2-form b diers from that of seiberg and witten by a factor 2, i.e.,

b = 2bsw.

4there actually exist [17,18] more complicated congurations of dp-branes with non-vanishing

ns b-eld. for example, the so-called ((f, d1), d3) non-threshold bound state given in [17] has

been used to discuss the gravity dual of ncym in [8].

5in this paper, we always consider innitely extended rather than compactied branes. one

advantage in choosing so is to avoid considerations of possible nite size eects as discussed in [5]

and non-local light winding modes as discussed in [3,7,19].

3

with p < p, the charge quantizations imply that 2f +b is also quantized. it can actually

be determined in terms of the quantized (integral) charges q and n (see [13], for example6),

where the integer n is the number of p-branes and the integer q is the number of parallel
p-branes per (2)(pp)(pp)/2 area over the (p  p)-plane perpendicular to the p-branes
in the worldvolume of p-branes. we therefore expect that the non-commutativity is actually

related to the integral charge q. as we will see, this is indeed true.

for concreteness, we will focus, in this paper, on the systems of non-threshold bound

states (d(p2), dp), for 2  p  6, in type ii string theories. the gravity congurations
of these bound states have been given in [13,20,17]. the asymptotic value of b-eld always

vanishes for each of these gravity solutions7. as mentioned earlier, we choose to work in the

gauge where the constant ux of the worldvolume gauge eld strength vanishes. by doing

so, we end up with a non-vanishing asymptotic value for the b-eld in each of the gravity

solutions. the component of this asymptotic b-eld, denoted as b, is actually given as8

6it can also be inferred from the contribution of 2f + b to the tension of the corresponding

non-threshold bound state as given in [1317].

7this is also true for all known gravity solutions of dp branes with non-vanishing b-eld, see for

examples [13,20,1618].

8in general, we could have b = a(q/n) with a an arbitrary constant. for the reasons given in

footnote 5, we always keep this dimensionless parameter a xed even in the ncym decoupling

limit. as discussed in detail in the following section, our philosophy of ncym decoupling limit is

to treat the coordinates in the two co-dimensions of the d(p - 2) and dp branes in (d(p - 2), dp)

similarly as the radial coordinate for the bound state in the decoupling limit. the former decouples

any vortex of q d(p - 2) branes from the rest in the two co-dimensions while the latter decouples

the asymptotic region from the near-horizon region. this leads to q  n in the ncym decoupling
limit. however, if the two co-dimensions form a torus rather than an innite plane (therefore, we

may have possible complications as mentioned in footnote 5), the dimensionless parameter a will

4

b = tan  = q/n, i.e., quantized in terms of the integer q and n described above9.

in the ncym decoupling limit, the large b is the key for the origin of ncym. more

precisely, as shown in [79], in order to obtain ncym we need b = tan  = b/ with
  0 and b = xed. for xed b, we end up only with the usual ym as demonstrated
in [17] and also pointed out in [8]. however, so far only the classical b = tan  has been

used in discussing ncym [7,8,6,33,9]. but as we have discussed above, b = tan  is in

be  b2/( v2) with v2 the area for the scaled torus in the decoupling limit. therefore, q/n  v2/b
which appears to be nite in the decoupling limit. this latter case will be discussed in [21]. apart

from the apparent dierence for q/n in the decoupling limit, the rest conclusions drawn in the

two cases are essentially the same. we are grateful to r.-g. cai and n. ohto for their question

which leads us to the above discussion. actually, the above scaled area v2 for the torus is not quite

independent of the noncommutative parameter b. if we denote the two coordinates as xp1, xp (we

discuss them in the following section), we have the noncommutative relation as [xp1, xp] = ib. so
we should have v2  b. therefore, we have q  n. this implies that whenever we have large n, we
must have large q but not the other way around.

9the integer q resembles, to some extent to the integer n. as discussed in [13,16], if one calculates

the noether charge associated with the innitely many d(p2) branes in (d(p2), dp), the
charge itself becomes innity. but the charge over the 2-dimensional area (2)2 perpendicular
to the d(p2) branes in the dp brane worldvolume is nite and is given as (q/(2)2)qp2
with qp2
0 = (2)(112p)/2(5p)/2 where the conventions for the charge is given in [22]. but

0

qp2

0

/((2)2) is just the charge units for the (p + 2)-form charge associated with the dp branes.

so this charge density looks like q units of dp brane charge. further, the tension for (d(p2),
dp) in string metric is t (d(p  2), dp) = t p
0 = 1/[(2)p(p+1)/2] the dp-brane
tension units and gs the asymptotic string coupling. in the above tension formula, since the integers

fact quantized according to b = tan  = q/n. so the above ncym decoupling limit
implies q/n = b/   in the low energy limit   0. in other words, we have q  n
in the ncym decoupling limit10. one of our observations in this paper is that:
in the

ncym decoupling limit, the innitely many d(p2) branes in the (d(p2), dp) system
plays dominating role over the n dp branes in the system. the non-commutativity actually

arises due to these d(p2) branes and the (p + 1)-dimensional ncym is just one way of
describing these d(p2) branes.

some closely related work and ideas have been presented some time ago by a number of

authors. townsend rst suggested an equivalence between a d2 brane and a condensate of

d0 branes [23]. his proposal was based on the following observation: a condensate of d0

branes can be described eectively by one-dimensional super ym theory with gauge group

u(), i.e., u(n) supersymmetric gauge quantum mechanics (sgqm) with n  . but
this is just another description of d2-brane which can be inferred from the description of

d = 11 closed supermembrane by a u(n) sgqm for n   established in [24] in the old
days of d = 11 supermembrane theory. this is also one of the motivations for the original

matrix theory proposal of m-theory [25]. generalizing this to other d-branes, ishibashi

argued that a d-brane in a constant b-eld background can be described equivalently as a

collection of innitely many lower dimensional d-branes [26]. however, the validity of the

above equivalence is not discussed in [26]. it appears that this has been remedied in [28].

the authors in the latter paper argued that a d2 brane with a constant worldvolume gauge

eld strength in the sen-seiberg limit [29,30] is described by the matrix theory quantum

mechanics action of d0 branes.

given the requirement of constant b-eld background for the above equivalence, it is

natural for these authors to seek the connection of their work to the ncym description of

d branes with this background. they nd whether one has an ordinary or noncommuta-

10see the explanation given in footnote 8

6

tive description depends on the gauge choice of the d brane worldvolume dieomorphism

[28,27]. if one takes the static gauge, i.e., the coordinates parallel to the brane are xed

and the worldvolume gauge eld remains dynamical, one ends up with an ordinary yang-

mills description. on the other hand, if one chooses the so-called constant eld strength

gauge, i.e., no uctuations of the ordinary gauge eld are allowed, then one ends up with

ncym description. in this latter gauge, the dynamical degrees of freedom, which are usu-

ally described by the ordinary worldvolume gauge eld, are now carried by the scalar elds

corresponding to the parallel coordinates of the brane. the noncommutative gauge eld

appears as the uctuations of these scalar elds with respect to the static bps congura-

tion [27,31]. especially in [31], the author pointed out that the decoupling limit for ncym

corresponds to the sen-seiberg limit. the two descriptions can be mapped to each other

through the worldvolume dieomorphism [27,31,32].

one of the goals in the present paper is to show that in the gravity dual description, the

(p + 1)-dimensional u(n) ncym is equivalent to an ordinary (p  1)-dimensinal ym with
gauge group u(q) with q/n = b/   and with b as the noncommutative parameter. in
other words, n dp branes with b = q/n is equivalent to innitely many d(p2) branes
without b-eld in the ncym decoupling limit. therefore, this work lends support to what

is just described above.

let us now examine the relation q/n = b/ more closely. we know that the xed

parameter b is directly related to the non-commutative geometry. the larger (smaller)

the b is, the more (less) non-commutative the space geometry will be. the presence of

this dimensionful parameter implies that a new scale is introduced into the theory under

consideration. we will spell out the meaning of this new scale in the following section. to
make sense of the system (d(p2), dp), we need n  1. large b requires large q and small
n from the relation q/n = b/. so for ncym we actually need large q and small n rather

than large n. in other words, large n really goes against the ncym eect even though it is

good for the gravity dual description in the usual ads/cft correspondence. it seems as if

there were an exception, i.e., we could take n large with a xed b. but from q/n = b/, we

7

see that we can increase n only at the price of increasing q for a xed b. for example, for

a xed b, when n = 1, we denote q = q0 which gives q0 = b/. now we want to increase

n = 1 to a large n while keeping b unchanged. then we must have q = nq0.

because the new parameter q or b accounts for the non-commutative eect in ncym

and if we really want to focus on this eect, one should take large q (or large b) and small n

even in the gravity dual description of ncym which is contrary to what have been claimed

in the literature. interpreted in another way, the real meaning for large n used in the

literature is the large q.

so in order to isolate the non-commutative eect and to nd the reason behind this

eect, we should limit ourselves to small n. without the loss of generality, we can simply

set n = 1 from now on11. as we will demonstrate in the following sections using the gravity

duals of ncym, whenever the gravity dual description is valid, the (d(p2), dp) system is
reduced to a system of innitely many d(p2) branes with two additional isometries and
without b-eld.

this paper is organized as follows. we will present the general features valid for all

(d(p2), dp) systems with 2  p  6 in the following section. in section 3, we will provide
in
detail evidence in supporting our above claims for the well-studied system (d1, d3).

section 4, we will discuss similar evidence for each of the remaining systems. we conclude

this paper in section 5.

ii. general properties

to begin with let us explain the new scale b further. in terms of the (p + 1)-dimensional

ncym description, this new scale denes the noncommutativity.

in the corresponding

ordinary (p+1)-dimensional yang-mills description, this new scale appears as a dimensionful

11when we take n = 1, we have the gauge group u (1) for ncym. for a general n, we have the

gauge group u (n).

coupling constant in addition to the usual gauge coupling, therefore giving rise to higher

dimensional operators. all these are due to the constant background b-eld. we know that

the relevant energy scale is u (i.e., the energy carried by an open string stretched between

a probe and the bound state which will be dened as r = u with r the radial coordinate

shortly). we also know that the physical eect of noncommutativity is not solely determined
by b but by some combination of b and u, i.e.,  b1/2u. for example, even for large b, if
b1/2u  1 the noncommutative eect is still negligible as pointed out in [8] (one may naively
think that large noncommutativity, i.e., large b, implies its large physical eect). it is hard

to understand this if one sticks with the either noncommutative or ordinary yang-mills

description of dp branes.

as we have discussed in the previous section and will demonstrate in this paper, in the

ncym decoupling limit, the (d(p2), dp) system is reduced to that of innitely many
it is much easier to
d(p2) branes with two additional isometries and without b-eld.
understand the above in the ordinary yang-mills description of these innitely many d(p2)
branes. unlike the dp branes, there are two kinds of transverse spaces to the d(p2)
branes. one is the common transverse space shared by both of the d(p2) and dp branes
in (d(p2), dp). the corresponding eld theories share the common energy scale u. now
the d(p2) branes have another transverse space with co-dimension two with respect to
the dp brane worldvolume. since this space is treated dierently from the previous one,

there must be another energy scale for the d(p2) branes. in other words, the eld theory
describing the low energy dynamics of the innitely many d(p2) branes needs two energy
scales one of which is u. what is the second energy scale?

we can estimate this scale in two dierent ways. for convenience, let, say, the d(p - 2)
branes lie along x0, x1,    , xp2 directions and the dp brane along x0, x1,    , xp2, xp1, xp
directions. as discussed in the previous section, we have q d(p2) branes per (2)2
area over the innitely extended xp1xp-plane. we can also view each set of q d(p - 2)

branes through the xp1xp-plane as a vortex on the plane. from the worldvolume viewpoint,

these vortices are magnetic ones.

in some sense, they resemble the vortices in type ii

9

superconductivity. each of these vortices has an area on the order of  and the distance
between the centers of two nearby vortices is on the order . now we can estimate the

characteristic separation d between two such d(p2) branes in a given vortex as

d =   (2)2

q

!1/2

.

(2.1)

if we substitute q = b/ obtained in the previous section in the above, we have d  /b1/2.
the energy carried by an open string stretched between two such d(p 2) branes in a given
vortex is given as d/  1/b1/2 which should dene the second energy scale.

as we will discuss latter in this section, the ncym decoupling limit also consists of
  0, r = u, x(p1),p = (/b) x(p1),p with u and x(p1),p xed. the limit   0 means
a low energy eld theory limit. r = u means that in the gravity description, only the

near-horizon region is relevant and it also denes the rst energy scale r/ = u mentioned

above. in analogy to r = u, xp = (/b) xp (the same for xp1) denes the distance between

a dynamical probe and the vortex of q d(p - 2) branes located at xp = xp1 = 0. hence the

xp is the length of an open string stretched between the probe and the vortex. therefore,

the second energy scale should also be given as xp/ = xp/b which is nite. note, however,

that the open string stretched between two nearby vortices carries an energy on the order of

/ = 1/   as   0 since the open string length is on the order . in other

words, the nearby vortices have no dynamical inuence on the vortex under consideration

in the ncym decoupling limit. so we need to consider only one vortex and the rest vortices

decouple from this one.

it appears in the above that we obtain two dierent estimations for the second energy

scale. let us resolve this apparent dierence. the second approach gives this scale as xp/b.

the xp should be viewed as the quantum-mechanical average of the corresponding operator.

because of the noncommutative relation [xp1, xp] = ib for the corresponding operators, we

should have the value for both of xp1 and xp on the order of b1/2. therefore, we have the

energy scale on the order 1/b1/2 which agrees with what we have obtained from the rst

approach. so we explain why we have a second energy scale and how this energy scale is

10

related to the parameter of noncommutativity b.

because of the presence of two energy scales, i.e., u and 1/b1/2, we have opportunities

to examine the low energy dynamics for these d(p2) branes. as is understood, the lower
scale is relevant for the low energy dynamics. if 1/b1/2  u, i.e., b1/2u  1, the dynamical
degrees of freedom associated with the scale 1/b1/2 are dominantly important while those

associated with the scale u are not. roughly speaking, the ordinary (p  1)-dimensional
yang-mills with gauge group u(q) (with q  ) explores only p + 1 spacetime dimensions
dynamically. since the scale 1/b1/2 is associated with open strings stretched between the

d(p2) branes rather than dp branes, the natural description of the dynamics is in terms
of these d(p2) branes even though it may not be the best. however, if we force ourselves
to describe the dynamics in terms of dp branes instead, we have to do something unnatural.

this unnatural twist is to make the two codimensions noncommutative and we expect that

the eect of noncommutativity is important. this is indeed true. as we will demonstrate

in the following sections. the validity of the gravity dual description of ncym requires
b1/2u  1. further the gravity conguration of dp brane with a constant b-eld is reduced
to that of d(p2) branes with two isometries and without b-eld. the importance of the
noncommutative eect can also be seen from the noncommutative  product for functions
f  g = f g + (1/2)iijif jg +   . if we choose to describe the underlying dynamics in
terms of dp branes, the apparent energy scale is u. therefore, f  uf . since ij  b for
the present case, we see that the leading noncommutative modication to the usual function
product is of the order bu2f g. in the present case, i.e., for b1/2u  1, the noncommutative
eect is indeed important as anticipated.

on the other hand, if 1/b1/2  u, i.e., b1/2u  1, then only the dynamical degrees of
in this case, the appearance

freedom associated with the energy scale u are important.

of the innite d(p2) branes only collectively modies the (n = 1) dp brane without
b-eld through the correction of order b1/2u  1. in other words, we do not expect the
corresponding noncommutative eect to be important if we choose to describe the underlying

11

dynamics in terms of the dp brane instead. this can be easily seen from the above  product
of functions. the gravity description of the ncym is not valid in this region. however, if

we are willing to extrapolate to this region as done in [8], the resulting gravity description

is nothing but the gravity dual of the ordinary yang-mills for dp branes without b-eld.

the above can also be interpreted as the usual large n limit. we rst set q = b/ with a

nite b. then q/n = (b/n)/. we take b = b/n. so in the large n limit, the u(n) ncym

is essentially the same as the corresponding ordinary u(n) ym. in other words, with xed

q behavior (i.e., xed b), in the large n limit, the u(n) ncym becomes an ordinary u(n)

ym.

let us provide further evidence in supporting our above explanation. in the presence of

constant bsw-eld, seiberg and witten have shown in [6] that the metric seen by the open

strings on the dp-branes is the eective open string metric gsw

m n rather than the closed

m n (m, n = 0, 1,    , 9). in the ncym decoupling limit, i.e., with gsw

string one gsw
m n and
bsw xed and   0, gsw
m n   along the directions in
which bsw are non-zero. they also give the relation between the open string coupling gs

m n should vanish according to gsw

and the closed string coupling gs as

gs = gs


det(cid:16)gsw + 2bsw(cid:17)

det gsw

1/2




,

(2.2)

where the metric gsw and bsw take values only along the dp-brane directions. the low

energy yang-mills coupling is given in terms of the open string coupling gs as

g2
ym = (2)p2(p3)/2gs.

as pointed out in [6], the gs and gs must scale in the following ways

gs

()(3p)/2 = xed,

gs

(3p+r)/2 = xed,

(2.3)

(2.4)

such that g2

ym can be kept nite for a quantum theory in the decoupling limit. we note that

the scaling of the closed string coupling depends on the rank r of the b-eld.

for our (d(p2), dp) systems, we always have r = 2. so gs = (5p)/2g = [3(p2)]/2g
if we look from the gravity dual viewpoint of the

with g xed in the decoupling limit.

12

ncym, only the closed string coupling gs is relevant. then the above scaling behavior of

gs is actually the same as that for simple d(p2) branes (i.e., without b-eld) rather than
simple dp branes in the decoupling limit for the usual correspondence discussed in [34]. for

example, for p = 5, i.e., for (d3, d5) system, the gs itself is xed in the ncym decoupling

limit which is the same as that for the simple d3 rather than the simple d5 branes in the

usual decoupling limit. this is entirely consistent with our above explanation. since the

gravity description is classical, we do not sense noncommutativity of the spatial directions

along which constant b-eld does not vanish. then our above discussion implies that this

description must be that of innitely many (i.e., q) d(p2) branes without b-eld. this is
indeed true as we will demonstrate. this explains the behavior of the closed string coupling

in the decoupling limit.

however, if we look from the open string viewpoint, the open string coupling gs is

relevant. from eq. (2.4), we have gs = (3p)/2gb, which will be derived in the following.

comparing this scaling behavior with what has been given in [34] for simple dp branes in

the decoupling limit for the usual ym, one can see that gs scales like that for simple dp

branes rather than for simple d(p2) branes as anticipated.

now let us study the gravity congurations for (d(p2), dp) systems and for d(p2)

branes with two additional isometries in the ncym decoupling limit, respectively.

the string-frame metric, the dilaton and the b-eld for (d(p2), dp) with 2  p  6,

where r = yiyi and qp = gscpn2 + q2(7p)/2 with cp = 25p(5p)/2((7  p)/2).

in the ncym decoupling limit (see [8], for example), we have,

  0,

gs = (5p)/2g,

q/n =

b
 .

also the following redened12 xs rather than the original xs are kept xed

x0,1,,(p2) = x0,1,,(p2),

x(p1),p =


b

x(p1),p.

(2.7)

(2.8)

one can check easily from eq.(2.5) that the asymptotic values for the metric, the dilaton

and the b-eld with respect to the xed xs correspond to the closed string moduli of seiberg

and witten [6] 13, respectively, if the relation between our b and the seiberg and wittens

bsw, i.e, b = 2bsw, is used. using eq. (2.2), we can have gs = (3p)/2gb as given

earlier.

in the ncym decoupling limit, any xed r 6= 0 region will decouple from the region
dened by r = u with u xed which provides the gravity dual description of the (d(p2),
dp) system. the vortex of q d(p - 2) branes located at xp1 = xp = 0 will decouple from

the rest of identical vortices. for convenience, let us write the ncym decoupling limit

collectively here:

b
 ,

gs = (5p)/2g,

q/n =

  0,
x0,1,,(p2) = x0,1,,(p2),

x(p1),p =


b

x(p1),p,

r = u,

(2.9)

where b, g, u, x remain xed. for the reason explained earlier, we always take n = 1 in

the following discussion.

12it appears that we have introduced additional scales for xp1, xp. as discussed earlier, these two

xed quantities are actually related to b because the noncommutative relation [xp1, xp] = ib. the

value of xp (or xp1) should correspond to the quantum-mechanical average of the corresponding

operator. it should be on the order of b1/2.

13this is a natural choice. but one could do dierently as in [33] where an eective string tension

is introduced and the  is set to 1.

14

with this limit, the ncym gauge coupling is given as

ym = (2)p2 bg,
g2

(2.10)

which is xed as expected. the ncym eective gauge coupling is g2

e  g2

ymup3. in this

paper, we will focus solely on the gravity dual description of ncym, which is expected to

be in the region where the perturbative calculations in super yang-mills cannot be trusted,

i.e.,

g2

e  1  


u  (gb)1/(3p),
p < 3
u  (1/(gb)1/(p3), p > 3

(2.11)

as discussed earlier, the relevant parameter for ncym is b. so we will investigate the

validity of the gravity dual description with respect to this parameter while keeping g xed.

with the limit eq. (2.9), the gravity description for (d(p2), dp) is

where g = gb(5p)/2, a = b1/2/(cpg)1/(7p) with constant cp dened earlier, and functions f (u)

and h are

f (u) =

(cpg)2/(7p)
(au)(3p)/2 ,

h =

1

1 + (au)7p .

(2.13)

note that the ncym eective string coupling, e, is nite in the decoupling limit (since

b, g and u remain xed). the curvature in string units is

r 

1

ge  vuut

u3p

gb  s (au)3p
g4/(7p) .

(2.14)

from the nc eld theory perspective, u is an energy scale. the limit u   means
going to uv in the eld theory. in this limit, unlike the cases for simple dp branes without

15

b-eld analysed in [34], the eective string coupling, e  (au)(7p)(p5)/2, vanishes for p < 5
while the ncym theory becomes uv free still for p < 3 (note that we have 2  p  6 in
this paper). for p > 3, the eld theory breaks down and we need new degrees of freedom

there. however, from the gravity side for 5 > p > 3, both the eective string coupling and

the curvature (see the second equation in (2.12) and eq.(2.14)) vanishes and therefore the

gravity description is perfectly good. for p = 5, the curvature still vanishes but the eective

string coupling remains nite as e = g. finally for p = 6, the string eective coupling

blows up and the dual description is needed. as pointed out in [9], even for this case,

the worldvolume theory with b-eld diers from that without b-eld in that the former

decouples from gravity while the latter does not [35,9] in their respective decoupling limits.

the reason for this is now clear that the d6 branes with constant b-eld are equivalent to

a system of innitely many (i.e., q) d4 branes without b-eld in the decoupling limit. the

decoupling of gravity in the latter system must imply the same in the former one.

let us now consider the gravity solutions of d(p2) branes with two additional isometries
for 2  p  6. they can be obtained from (d(p2), dp) simply by setting the charge
associated with dp branes to zero. in doing so, we need to use the original b-eld, (rather

than the one given above where a gauge choice is made for ncym) and we nd that as

n = 0, h  = 1 and so b = 0. if we take the same limit as given in eq. (2.9) except for q/n

which is now replaced by q = b/ we end up with14,

e2 = g2(au)(7p)(p5)/2,

b = 0,

(2.15)

14if we do not take n = 1 in the discussion of (d(p  2), dp) system above, we simply choose the
b here as n times b there.

16

where a, g and f (u) are the same as given before. as discussed before, the above con-

guration should be explained as the one describing q   d(p - 2) branes located at
xp1 = xp = 0.

comparing eq. (2.15) for q d(p2) branes with eq. (2.12) for (d(p2), dp), we see
that the two congurations become the same, except for the b-eld, if au  1. the former
has b(p1)p = 0 while the latter has a constant b(p1)p = /b (note that the b(p1)p is

dened with respect to the xed x coordinates though the corresponding 2-form is inert

under the rescalings of coordinates). for the gravity conguration of q d(p2) branes, any
non-vanishing constant b-eld along directions transverse to the d(p2) branes can always
be gauged away [6]. so we conclude that the two congurations are identical if au  1.
further, as we will demonstrate, au  1 implies b1/2u  1, i.e., in the region of strong
noncommutative eects. therefore the crucial point for us to establish the equivalence

between the q d(p2) branes and dp branes is to show whenever the gravity description
is valid, we always end up with au  1. as we will show in the following sections, this is
indeed true.

note also that the (d(p2), dp) system preserves the same number (sixteen) of su-
persymmetries as d(p2) branes with two additional isometries. this is necessary for the
equivalence.

iii. the (d1, d3) system

the decoupling limit for this system with classical b = tan  has been studied in [8].

here we revisit this system with quantized b = tan  = q/n. as explained in the previous

sections, we shall take n = 1. taking p = 3 in the ncym decoupling limit eq. (2.9), we

have

q =

  0,
x0,1 = x0,1,

b
 ,
x2,3 =

gs = g,


b

x2,3,

r = u,

17

(3.1)

where b, g, u, x remain xed. in this limit, the asymptotic region decouples from the near-

horizon region which describes the (d1, d3) system.

in particular, q  n implies that d-strings in the system plays the dominating role
over the n d3 branes. since the noncommutative geometry in x2x3 directions is controlled

by the parameter b which is in turn controlled by the large integer q, therefore the non-

commutativity is due to the innitely many d-strings in the system. notice that the open

string coupling gs = g with g = gb, the closed string coupling at the ir15 while the closed

string coupling gs = g. this tells us that from the noncommutative open string perspective

(or the noncommutative eld theory description) the system looks like d3 branes while from

the closed string side (or the gravity description) it behaves like d-strings if we compare the

scalings of these string couplings with those for simple d-branes (i.e., without b-eld) given

in [34] in their respective decoupling limits.

in this section, using the gravity dual description of ncym, we will provide evidence for

the claim that the (d1, d3) system is reduced to a system of q d-strings without b-eld.

the gravity description for (d1, d3) has the form

ds2 = (f 1u2hdx2

0 + dx2

1 + h(cid:16)dx2

2 + dx2

3(cid:17)i + f   du2

h

h =

a2 =

f 2 = 4g.

(3.2)

this has been obtained by setting p = 3 in eq. (2.12) and we have also included in the above

the rr 2-form a associated with the d-strings and the self-dual rr 5-form eld strength

h. note also that b23, a01 and h0123u are now dened with respect to the new coordinates

through the corresponding forms which are inert under the rescalings of coordinates.

15the open string coupling or the gauge coupling is also related to the closed string coupling at

ir for the usual ads5/cf t4 correspondence with xed q and n as pointed out in [17].

18

the curvature in string units is given by eq. (2.14) and can also be read o from the

metric in (3.2) as

r 

1
ge 

1
g

,

(3.3)

where g2

e = 2g for p = 3. the gravity description is good if the eective string coupling,

e, and the above curvature in string units are small, i.e.,

g

q1 + (au)4  1,

g2
e  g  1.

(3.4)

as usual, the validity of gravity description requires large eective gauge coupling ge which

implies that the eld theory description breaks down. the above equation says

au  g1/2  1.

(3.5)

as explained in the previous section, we always keep g xed. so large g = gb means large b

which is consistent with the picture that the non-commutative eect is important for large

au in the gravity description.

notice that since a  b1/4/g1/4 is large with large b and xed g, large au does not
necessarily mean large u. therefore the condition (3.5) for u does not mean that we approach
the boundary which is at u = . further we have b1/2u  au  1 which implies that the
dynamical degrees of freedom are due to the d-strings as explained before. let us examine
the conguration (3.2) under eq. (3.5) with xed g. in this case, h  1/(au)4 and b23
for large b even if it is measured in terms of
approaches its constant but small value 
b
. the 5-form eld strength h0123u/2  1/[(g5/4b11/4)au] approaches zero in the limit.
however, via eq. (3.5), the rr 2-form a01/  bu4/g2 = g(au)4/g2  1 survives. so
everything goes over to that of q d-strings as given in eq. (2.15) (with p = 3) in the same

limit eq. (3.1). in other words, when the gravity dual description of ncym for d3 branes

with large asymptotic b-eld is valid, this gravity system is reduced to q d-strings without

b-eld.

in the region g1/2  au  1, the eective string coupling is large. so, we need to go
to the s-dual gravity description. in this case, (f, d3) is reduced to q f-strings without

19

rr 2-form eld since under the s-duality, d-strings become f-strings ((d1, d3) becomes

(f, d3)). under s-duality the ns 2-form b becomes a rr 2-form while the rr 2-form a

becomes a ns 2-form and this is the reason for the appearance of f-strings.

under s-duality, we have

where ls =  is the string length scale in the original variables. so, the new metric and

the dilaton are given as,

(3.7)

where the harmonic functions continue to be given by eq. (2.6) but gs and  in the charge

q3 are replaced by their s-dual values through the relations in eq. (3.6). one can check

that the metric and the dilaton are indeed those describing the (f, d3) system as given in

[16].

following [9], the decoupling limit for this system is the same as those given in eq. (3.1).

the only dierence is that we express them in terms of l

s and g 

s through gs = 1/g 

s and

s  0. in the decoupling limit, we have the following for (f, d3)

1/g = 1/gb. the curvature measured in l

s is given as,

l2
sr

q g (1 + a4u4)

(3.9)

the gravity description is good when the eective string coupling, e, and the curvature

are small, i.e.,

20

1
1/4  au 
g 

1
1/2 ,
g 

(3.10)

which is true if g  = 1/g  1. in the original g, eq.(3.10) says 1  g1/4  au  g1/2.
for xed g, g  1 implies large b and au  1 implies h  1/(au)4. we have again
b1/2u  au  1. then the gravity description for (f, d3) goes over to that for q f-strings
in the similar limit as expected.

iv. the remaining (d(p2), dp) systems

in this section we discuss the equivalence for the rest of the (d(p2), dp) systems.

where g = gb3/2, a = b1/2/(62g)1/5. the curvature in string units is

r

ge  s u

gb  s au
g4/5 .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

the gravity description is valid if the eective string coupling, e, and the above curvature

in string units are small, i.e.,

g4/15  au  g4/5,

21

(4.4)

which can hold only if g  1. for xed g, this implies large b and therefore the large non-
commutativity. we also have b1/2u  au  1 which implies that the dynamical degrees of
freedom are due to d0 branes and the noncommutative eect is important. the au  1
implies h  1/(au)5. since a  b1/5/g1/5, this is also large. so large au does not necessarily
mean large u. with the above, we have the metric and the dilaton reduced to those of q d0

branes in the same limit as given in eq. (2.15) for p = 2. note that b12/ = 1/b is now a

small constant for large b.

in the region au  g4/15, the eective string coupling, e, becomes large. so, we need
to lift this system to eleven dimensions. it can still be described by the 11d supergravity if

the curvature in 11d plank units remains small. we have the 11d curvature in 11d plank

units as

l2

pr  e2/3 1

ge 

g4/15

(au)1/3(1 + a5u5)1/3  1

(4.5)

which gives au  g2/15. so the 11d gravity description for the system is valid if g2/15 
au  g4/15. for this to be true, we must have g  1, therefore b becomes large for xed
g. precisely with these, the gravity description for the lifted (d0, d2) branes is the same as

that for the lifted d0 branes.

(d2, d4):

the decoupling limit for this system is

q =

x3,4 =

gs = 1/2g,

qgbu 

(4.7)

(4.8)

unlike the case for d4 branes without b-eld, the closed string coupling gs = 1/2g

vanishes (rather than blows up) in the decoupling limit. it is still proper to consider the

10d gravity description for this system. in order to have a valid gravity description, the

eective string coupling, e, and the above curvature in string units need to remain small,

i.e.,

g2

(au)3/2
1 + (au)3  1,

au  1/g4/3.

(4.9)

we have two cases here depending on whether g  1 or g < 1. for g < 1, the rst equation
in (4.9) can be satised if au  1 or au  g4/3. however, au  1 is imcompatible with
the second equation in (4.9) if g < 1. so we have au  1/g4/3 > 1 for which the gravity
description is valid. in this case, since g < 1, the b is not large and a is not large, either.

therefore au  1 does require large u. so, when the gravity description is valid, we are
approaching the boundary. similar analysis tells us that au  g4/3 > 1 is the condition for
a valid gravity description if g > 1. again, we need to approach the boundary, i.e., large
u to validate the gravity description. the crucial thing here is that au  1 and b1/2u  1
hold true whenever the gravity description is valid. now we have h  1/(au)3. the metric
and the dilaton go over to those of q d2 branes in the same limit. but there is a dierence

here from the previous cases considered, i.e., the b-eld no longer remains small the way it

happens before. it actually becomes a constant, i.e., b34/ = 1/b. so long as the gravity

description for the d2 branes is concerned, a constant b23 makes no dierence from zero

b23. therefore, we expect that the (d2, d4) system is reduced to q d2 branes.

for g < 1, the eective string coupling can never be large. however, for g > 1, the
eective string coupling, e, is large in the region au  g4/3. in that case, we need to lift

23

(d2, d4) to eleven dimensions. the 11d gravity description is valid if the curvature in 11d

planck units is small, i.e.,

l2

pr  e2/3 1

ge 

1

(1 + a3u3)1/3  1,

(4.10)

which requires au  1. so the lifted (d2, d4) can be described by 11d gravity if 1 
au  g4/3. this can be true only if g  1. for xed g, it means large b, therefore large
a  b1/3/g1/3. so, we do not necessarily have large u here. for this description, the lifted
(d2, d4) goes over to the lifted d2 branes.

(d3, d5):

the corresponding decoupling limit is

where g = g, a = b1/2/(g)1/2. the curvature in string units is

qgbu2 

again unlike the case for d5 branes without b-eld, the string coupling gs = g is xed

(rather than blows up). it resembles that for d3 branes without b-eld in the decoupling

limit. the gravity description is good if both the eective string coupling, e, and the above

curvature in string units remain small. this requires

24

au 

1
g

,

g < 1.

(4.14)

from above we have au  1 and b1/2u  1. then both the dilaton and the b-eld become
constant. we also have h  1/(au)2 now. we do not have any condition for b which implies
that u itself must be large, i.e. we need to approach the boundary. the gravity description

goes over to that for q d3 branes in the same decoupling limit.

when g  1, we need to go to its s-dual description. the b-eld becomes rr 2-form
eld. the d5 branes become ns 5-branes. so, (d3, d5) goes over to (d3, ns5). using eq.

(3.6), we have

(1 + a2u2),

where g  = 1/g, h continues to be the one given in eq. (4.12) and the same is for the

parameter a. the curvature in dual string units is

l2
sr =

1

au(1 + a2u2)1/2 .

(4.16)

the dual gravity description is valid when we have 1  au  1/ g  = g which ensures that
both the eective string coupling and the curvature in the dual string units remain small.
with this, h  1/(au)2. therefore, the (d3, ns5) goes over to the s-dual d3 branes. note
also that b does not play any role here and we expect that we need to approach the boundary.
this is indeed true from au  1  b1/2u  g1/2  1.

(d4, d6):

the string coupling gs blows up in the decoupling limit. but it blows up the same way as

25

that for d4 branes without b-eld rather than that for d6 branes without b-eld. because

of this blowing up, the theory is better analysed in eleven dimensions.

the gravity description is valid if both the eective string coupling and the above curvature
in string units are small. this gives 1/g4/3  au  1/g4 which can hold true only if
g  1. for xed g, this implies large b. the above also implies au  1/g4/3  1 and
b1/2u  1/g1/3  1. then h  1/(au). here b56/ = 1/b vanishes for large b. so the (d4,
d6) system goes over to q d4 branes in the same limit.

in the region au  1/g4  1, the eective string coupling is large. we need to lift the
(d4, d6) system to eleven dimensions. the 11d gravity description is valid if the following

curvature in 11d planck units is small, i.e.,

g4/3au(1 + au)1/3  1,

(4.20)

which gives au  1/g. so au  1/g4  1 already ensures small curvature in 11d planck
units. since we have au  1, b1/2u  1/g3  1 and g  1, the lifted (d4, d6) goes over to
the lifted d4 branes.

v. conclusion

in this paper, we have investigated what causes the noncommutativity in terms of gravity

dual description of ncym for systems of non-threshold bound states (d(p2), dp) with 2 
p  6 in type ii string theories. our study along with previous works strongly indicates that
in the ncym decoupling limit, the dp branes with a constant b-eld represent dynamically

a system of innitely many d(p2) branes without b-eld. in this limit, the corresponding
(p + 1)-dimensional ncym is just a better description of (p 1)-dimensional ordinary yang-
mills with gauge group u(q) with q   in that it has a nite gauge group u(n) and
a nite gauge coupling. the price we pay is that we have noncommutative space in the

directions of nonvanishing b-eld and we need to introduce the  product for functions. in
other words, we nd that the noncommutativity is entirely due to our choice in employing

dp branes to describe the dynamics of innitely many d(p2) branes without b-eld. we
give a clear explanation about the new parameter b which is related to the intrinsic energy
scale 1/b1/2 for the d(p2) branes.

in particular, we have shown that the gravity conguration of (d(p2), dp) system
or dp branes with a constant b-eld is reduced to that of innitely many d(p2) branes
without b-eld in the ncym limit and in the region of valid gravity description. the

present study provides also the reason that the d6 brane with b-eld can decouple from

the gravity while the simple d6 brane without b-eld cannot in their respective decoupling

limits. we expect that d7 branes with a rank 2 b-eld can decouple from gravity, too, in

the ncym decoupling limit since it describes innitely many d5 branes with two additional

isometries and without b-eld. but this will not be true for d8 or d9 branes with a rank 2

b-eld. our study indicates that in general dp branes with a rank r constant b-eld, this

system can decouple from gravity in the ncym limit if p = p  r < 6. in other words, the
higher the rank r is, the better chance we have for the dp branes to decouple from gravity.

for example, d8 branes with rank 4 b-eld can decouple from gravity.
