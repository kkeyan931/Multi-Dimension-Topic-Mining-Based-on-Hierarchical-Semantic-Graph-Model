abstract

i review the issue of string and compactication scales in
the weak-coupling regimes of string theory. i explain how
in the brane world scenario a (eectively) two-dimensional
transverse space that is hierarchically larger than the string
length may replace the conventional energy desert described
by renormalizable supersymmetric qft. i comment on the
puzzle of unication in this context.

1. the sqft hypothesis

string/m-theory [1] is a higher-dimensional theory with a single
dimensionful parameter, which can be taken to be the fundamental

string tension or the eleven-dimensional planck scale. the theory
has on the other hand a large number of dynamical parameters
characterizing its many distinct semiclassical vacua, such as com-

pactication radii or sizes of defects localized in the compact space.
understanding how the standard model and einstein gravity arise

at low energies in one of those vacuum states is a central outstand-
ing problem of string/m-theory.

1based on talks given at the conferences 22nd johns hopkins workshop
(goteborg, august 1998), fundamental interactions: from symmetries to black
holes in honor of francois englert (brussels, march 1999) and from planck
scale to electroweak scale (bad honnef, april 1999).

the usual hypothesis is that the string, compactication and
planck scales lie all close to one another, and that the physics at

lower energies is well described by some eective four-dimensional
renormalizable supersymmetric quantum eld theory (sqft), which

must include the minimal supersymmetric standard model (mssm)
and some hidden sectors. i will refer to this picture of the world as

the sqft hypothesis. in this picture the breaking of the resid-
ual supersymmetry and the generation of the electroweak scale are
believed to be triggered by non-perturbative gaugino condensation

 a story that is however incomplete because of the problems of
vacuum stability and of the cosmological constant.

the minimal version of the sqft hypothesis is obtained when
there are no light elds charged under su(3)c  su(2)ew  u(1)y ,
besides those of the mssm. this is the energy desert scenario  a
slight misnommer since the desert may be populated by all sorts

of stu coupling with gravitational strength to ordinary matter.
the minimal unication scenario is supported, as is well known
[2, 3, 4], by two pieces of strong, though indirect evidence: (a) the

measured low-energy gauge couplings do meet when extrapolated
to higher energies with the mssm -functions, and (b) the energy
mu  2  1016gev at which they meet is in the same ball-parc
as the string scale. a detailed analysis within the weakly-coupled

heterotic string [5] leads, in fact, to a discrepancy of roughly one
order of magnitude between the theoretical point of string uni-

cation, and the one that ts the low-energy data. this is a small
discrepancy on a logarithmic scale, and it could be xed by small
modications of the minimal scenario [6].

besides being simple and rather natural, the minimal sqft
hypothesis makes thus two quantitative predictions which t the

low-energy data to better than one part in ten.

2

2. the weakly-coupled heterotic theory

the sqft hypothesis is particularly compelling in the context
of the weakly-coupled heterotic string [7]. both the graviton and

the gauge bosons live in this case in the ten-dimensional bulk, and
their leading interactions are given by the same order in string
perturbation theory (i.e. the sphere diagram). this leads to the
universal relation between the four-dimensional planck mass (mp )
and the tree-level yang-mills couplings [8],

m 2

p  m 2

h/g2

ym ,

(2.1)

independently of the details of compactication. if we assume that
gym  o(1), then the heterotic string scale (mh ) is necessarily
tied to the planck scale. furthermore, the standard kaluza-klein

formula for the four-dimensional gauge couplings is

1/g2

ym  (rmh )6/g2
h ,

(2.2)

with r the typical radius of the six-dimensional compact space
and gh the dimensionless string coupling. pushing the kaluza-
klein scale (mkk  r1) much below mh requires therefore a
hierarchically-strong string coupling, and invalidates the semiclas-

sical treatment of the vacuum. of course all radii need not be equal
but, at least in orbifold compactications, t-duality allows us to

take them all larger or equal to the string length, and then the
above argument forbids any single radius from becoming too large.
there is actually a loophole in the above reasonning. if some

compact dimensions are much larger than the heterotic string length,
loop corrections to the inverse squared gauge couplings will generi-

3

cally grow like a power of radius [5]. 2 3 it is thus logically conceiv-
able that even though the observed low-energy gauge couplings are

of order one, their tree-level values are hierarchically smaller. since
it is the tree-level couplings that enter in the relation (2.1), the

heterotic string scale could thus in principle be signicantly lower
than the four-dimensional planck mass [11].

the main motivation for contemplating such possibilities in the
past was the search for string models with low-energy supersymme-
try broken spontaneously at tree level. existing heterotic vacua of

this type employ a string variant [12] of the scherk-schwarz mech-
anism [13], which breaks supersymmetry in a way reminiscent of

nite-temperature eects. the scale of (primordial) breaking is
proportional to an inverse radius, so that lowering it to the elec-

troweak scale requires the openning of extra dimensions at the tev
 a feature shown [14] to be generic in orbifold models. 4

insisting on tree-level breaking is, on the other hand, only a
technical requirement  there is no reason why the breaking in
nature should not have a non-perturbative origin. furthermore,

scherk-schwarz compactication has not so far lead to any new in-
sights on the problems of vacuum selection and stability. thus,

there seems to be little theoretical motivation at this point for
abandonning the sqft hypothesis, and its successful unication

predictions, in heterotic string theory.

2in special models, such as orbifolds without n=2 sectors, these large thresh-
old corrections can be made to vanish at one-loop. the evolution of gauge
couplings with energy is thus unaected by the openning of large extra dimen-
sions [9]. however, since gh must in these models be hierarchically strong, the
semiclassical string vacuum cannot be trusted.

3 power corrections to gauge couplings have been also recently invoked as a

way to speed up the unication process [10].

4for more general compactications, the limit of supersymmetry restoration
is also known to be a singular limit [15], even though there is no precise relation
between the scale of symmetry breaking and some kaluza klein threshold.

4

3. brane world and open string theory

the story is dierent in the theory of (unoriented) open and
closed strings, in which gauge and gravitational interactions have

dierent origins. while the graviton (a closed-string state) lives in
the ten-dimensional bulk, open-string vector bosons can be local-
ized on defects [16]  the worldvolumes of d(irichlet)-branes [17].

furthermore while closed strings interact to leading order via the
sphere diagram, open strings must be attached to a boundary and

thus interact via the disk diagram which is of higher order in the
genus expansion. the four-dimensional planck mass and yang-

mills couplings therefore read

1/g2

ym  (rkmi)6n/gi , m 2

p  rn

r6n

k m 8

i /g2
i ,

(3.3)

where r is the typical radius of the n compact dimensions trans-
verse to the brane, rk the typical radius of the remaining (6-n)
compact longitudinal dimensions, mi the type-i string scale and
gi the string coupling constant. as a result (a) there is no uni-
versal relation between mp , gym and mi anymore, and (b) tree-
level gauge couplings corresponding to dierent sets of branes have
radius-dependent ratios and need not unify.

a few remarks before going on. first, we are here discussing a
theory of unoriented strings, because orientifolds [19] are required
in order to cancel the tension and rr charges of the (non-compact)

space-lling d-branes. second, using t-dualities we can ensure that
both r and rk are greater than or equal to the string scale [16].
this may take us either to ia or to ib theory (also called i or i,
respectively)  i will not make a distinction between them in what

follows. finally, it should be stressed that d-branes are the only
known defects which can localize non-abelian gauge interactions

in a perturbative setting. orbifold xed points can at most trap

5

matter elds and abelian vector bosons (from twisted rr sectors).5
relations (3.3) tell us that type i string theory is much more

exible (and less predictive) than heterotic theory. the string scale
mi is now a free parameter, even if one insists that both gym and
gi be kept xed and of o(1). this added exibility can be used to
remove the order-of-magnitude discrepancy between the unication

and string scales [20]. a much more drastic proposal [21, 22, 23]
is to lower mi down to the experimentally-allowed limit  o(tev).
keeping for instance gi, gym and rkmi of order one, leads to the
condition

rn
  m 2

p /m 2+n

.

(3.4)

a tev string scale would then require from n=2 millimetric to n=6
fermi-size dimensions transverse to our brane world  the relative

weakness of gravity being in this picture attributed to the transverse
spreading of gravitational ux.

what has brought this idea 6 into sharp focus [21] was (a) the
realization that submillimeter dimensions are not at present ruled
out by mesoscopic gravity experiments,7 and (b) the hope that low-
ering mi to the tev scale may lead to a new understanding of the
gauge hierarchy. needless to say that a host of constraints (astro-

physical and cosmological bounds, proton decay, fermion masses
etc.) will make realistic model building a very strenuous exercise

indeed. finding type i vacua with three chiral families of quarks

5non-perturbative symmetry enhancement is of course a possibility, as has
been discussed for instance in [18]. the great success of the perturbative stan-
dard model makes one, however, reluctant to start with a theory in which w
bosons, and all quarks and leptons do not correspond to perturbative quanta.

6for early discussions of a brane universe see [24].
7that such experiments do not rule out light scalar particles, such as axions,
with gravitational-force couplings and compton wavelengths of a millimeter or
less, had been already appreciated in the past [25]. the kaluza-klein excita-
tions of the graviton are basically subject to the same bound.

6

and leptons is already a non-trivial problem by itself [26]. none of
these diculties seems, however, a priori fatal to the brane world

idea, even in its most extreme realization [27].

4. renormalization group or classical supergravity?

although the type i string scale could lie anywhere below the
four-dimensional planck mass,8 i will now focus on the extreme
case where it is close to its experimental lower limit, mi  o(tev).
besides being a natural starting point for discussing the question

of the gauge hierarchy, this has also the pragmatic advantage of
bringing string physics within the reach of future acceleretor ex-

periments. this extreme choice is at rst sight antipodal to the
minimal sqft hypothesis : the mssm is a stable renormalizable

eld theory, and yet one proposes to shrink its range of validity to
one order of magnitude at most! nevertheless, as i will now argue,
the brane world and sqft scenaria share many common features

when the number of large transverse dimensions in the former is
exactly two [29, 30].

the key feature of the sqft hypothesis is that low-energy pa-
rameters receive large logarithmic corrections, which are eectively

resummed by the equations of the renormalization group. this
running with energy can account for the observed values of the three

gauge couplings, and of the mass matrices of quarks and leptons,
in a way that is relatively robust.9 furthermore the logarithmic
sensitivity of parameters generates naturally hierarchies of scales,

and has been the key ingredient in all eorts to understand the
origin of the mz/mp hierarchy in the past [31].

8arguments in favour of an intermediate string scale were given in [28].
9one must of course assume initial conditions for the rg equations, typically
imposed by unication and by discrete symmetries, but there is no need to know
in greater detail the physics in the ultraviolet regime.

7

consider now the brane world scenario. the parameters of the
eective brane lagrangian are dynamical open- and closed-string
moduli. these latter, denoted collectively by mk, include the dila-
ton, twisted-sector massless scalars, the metric of the transverse

space etc. their vacuum expectation values are constant along the
four non-compact space-time dimensions, but vary generically as a

function of the transverse coordinates . for weak type-i string cou-
pling and large transverse space these variations can be described
by a lagrangian of the (schematic) form

lbulk+lsource  z dn h 1

g2
i

(mk)2+

1
gi xs

fs(mk)(s)i. (4.1)

this is a supergravity lagrangian reduced to the n large transverse
dimensions, and coupling to d-branes and orientifolds which act as
sources localized at transverse positions s.10 the couplings fs(mk)
may vary from source to source  they can for instance depend on
open-string moduli  and are subject to global consistency condi-

tions. what is important, however, to us is that they are weak in
the type-i limit, leading to weak variations,

mk() = m0

k + gi m1

k() +    ,

(4.2)

k a constant, m1

with m0
k a sum of greens functions etc. for n = 2
dimensions the leading variation m1
k grows logarithmically with the
size of the transverse space, r. since our standard model param-
eters will be a function of the moduli evaluated at the position of
our brane world, they will have logarithmic sensitivity on mp in
this case, very much like the (relevant) parameters of a supersym-
metric renormalizable qft. similar sensitivity will occur even if

10in the general case there could be also branes extending only partially into
the large transverse bulk. our discussion can be adapted easily to take those
into account.

8

n > 2, as long as some twisted moduli propagate in only two extra
large dimensions.

let me now discuss the validity of the approximation (4.1). the
bulk supergravity lagrangian receives both  and higher-genus cor-
rections, but these involve higher derivatives of elds and should be
negligible for moduli varying logarithmically over distance scales
. the source functions, fs(mk), are also in general modi-

ed by such corrections  our -function approximation is indeed
only valid to within   o(). such source modications can,

however, be absorbed into boundary conditions for the classical
eld equations at the special marked points s. the situation thus
looks (at least supercially) analogous to that prevailing under the
sqft hypothesis : large corrections to low-energy parameters can

be in both cases resummed by dierential equations with appro-
priate boundary conditions. there are, to be sure, also important

dierences :
in particular, the renormalization group equations
are rst order dierential equations in a single (energy) scale pa-
rameter, while the classical supergravity equations are second-order

and depend on the two coordinates of the large transverse space.

the analogy between energy and transverse distance is also rem-

iniscent of the holographic idea [32], considered in the context of
compactication in [33].
it is, however, important to stress that

our discussion here stayed pertubative (and there was no large-n
limit involved).
i have just tried to argue that large string-loop

corrections to the parameters of a brane action can, in appropri-
ate settings, be calculated reliably as the sum of two supercially
similar eects:
(a) rg running from some low energy scale up

to string scale, and (b) bulk-moduli variations over a transverse
two-dimensional space of size much greater than string length. the

two corresponding regimes  of renormalizable qft and of reduced

9

classical supergravity  are a priori dierent and need not overlap.

5. the puzzle of unication

the logarithmic sensitivity of brane parameters on r can be
used to generate scale hierarchies dynamically, exactly as with renor-
malizable qft. gauge dynamics on a given brane, for example, can

become strong as the transverse space expands to a hierarchically
large size, thereby inducing gaugino condensation and possibly su-
persymmetry breaking. rather than discussing such scenaria fur-

ther, i would now like to return to the main piece of evidence in
favour of the sqft hypothesis : the apparent unication of the

standard model gauge couplings. can their observed low-energy
values be understood [29, 34] in an equally robust and controlled

manner, as coming from logarithmic variations in the (real) space
transverse to our brane world ?11 i dont yet know the answer to
this important question, but let me at least refute the following

possible objection : since the three gauge groups of the standard
model live at the same point in transverse space (or else matter

charged under two of them would have been ultraheavy) how can
real-space variations split their coupling constants apart ? this ob-

jection would have been, indeed, fatal if all gauge couplings were
determined by the same combination of bulk elds. this is fortu-

nately not the case : scalar moduli from twisted sectors of orbifolds
have been, for instance, shown to have non-universal couplings to
gauge elds living on the same brane [36, 34]. the logarithmic

variations of such elds could split the three standard model gauge
couplings apart, although it is unclear why this splitting should be

in the right proportion.
