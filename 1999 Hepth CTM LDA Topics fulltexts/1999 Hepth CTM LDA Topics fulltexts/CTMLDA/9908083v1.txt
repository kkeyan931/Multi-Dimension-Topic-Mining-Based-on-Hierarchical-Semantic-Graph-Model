generalized chern-simons form and descent equation

department of physics, boston university, boston, ma 02215

yoshitaka okumura 

abstract

we present the general method to introduce the generalized chern-simons form and the descent
equation which contain the scalar eld in addition to the gauge elds. it is based on the technique
in a noncommutative dierential geometry (ncg) which extends the 4-dimensional minkowski space
m4 to the discrete space such as m4  z2 with two point space z2. however, the resultant equations
do not depend on ncg but are justied by the algebraic rules in the ordinary dierential geometry.

introduction

the chern-simons theory [1] has been extensively studied so far with great interests both for their the-
oretical interests as the topological quantum eld theories [2] and their practical applications for certain
planar condensed matter phenomena such as the fractional quantum hall eects and high temperature
super conductivity [3], [4]. especially, three dimensional chern-simons theory depending on three dimen-
sional chern-simons form [5] provides a eld theoretic framework for studying knots and links in three
dimension. furthermore, three dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological constant is described
by two chern-simons theories [7]. this approach [8] makes it possible to exactly calculate the black hole
entropy beyond the semi-classical calculations.

the occurrences of yang-mills anomalies and other topological terms such as axial anomaly, schwinger
terms and chern characters are the important aspect of quantized gauge theories. thus, the descent
equations [6] are very important because a series of these equations prescribe the relations between
yang-mills anomalies.

connes proposed the noncommutative geometry on the product space of the 4-dimensional minkowski
space [10] and two point space z2. the higgs boson eld is regarded as a kind of gauge eld on the
discrete space z2 in this formulation. in fact, the higgs boson has several similarities with the ordinary
gauge elds such as the same type couplings with fermions and the trilinear and quartic self-couplings.
the higgs mechanism naturally works without assuming the higgs potential leading to the spontaneous
breakdown of gauge symmetry.

after the original formulation of ncg by connes [10], many versions of ncg [11] has appeared and
succeeded to reconstruct the spontaneously broken gauge theories. morita and the present author [12]
proposed the generalized dierential geometry (gdg) on the discrete space m4z2 and reconstructed the
weinberg-salam model. in this formulation on m4  z2 the extra dierential one-form  is introduced in
addition to the usual one-form dx and so our formalism is the generalization of the ordinary dierential
geometry on the continuous manifold. this formulation was generalized to gdg on the discrete space
m4  zn [13], [14] by introducing the extra one-forms k(k = 1, 2    n ), which generalization enabled
us to reconstruct the left-right symmetric gauge theory, su(5) gut and so(10) gut.

from the standpoint of ncg, the higgs boson is a gauge eld of the principal bundle on the discrete
space. thus, it is expected that there exist the chern-simons forms and descent equations including the
scalar boson eld in addition to the ordinary gauge eld. in this letter, we address this problem and
present the general method to introduce these generalized chern-simons form and descent equations by
use of the technique in ncg. it should be noted that we use ncg but the resultant formulas are free
from ncg and are justied by the direct calculations in the ordinary dierential geometry.

2 dierential geometry on the product space mn  z2

the generalized gauge eld is dened on the product space mn  z2 with n -dimensional minkowski
space mn and the two points space z2 as

a(x) = (cid:18) a1(x)

h21(x)1

h12(x)2

a2(x) (cid:19) ,

(2.1)

1(x)(cid:17) and a2(x)(cid:16)= a

where a1(x)(cid:16)= a
2(x)(cid:17) are gauge elds belonging to the self-adjoint represen-
tations of unitary gauge groups g1 and g2, respectively and h12(x)(cid:0)= h21(x)(cid:1) is a scalar eld belonging
to the covariant representation of g1 and g2. we do not call h12 the higgs boson eld because its vacuum
expectation value is irrelevant to our formulation. in addition, a1(x) = a
2 (x)dx
and 1 and 2 are one-form base on the discrete space z2 which satisfy the following algebraic rules.

1 (x)dx, a2(x) = a

dx  dx = dx  dx,

dx  k = k  dx,

k  l = l  k,

(2.2)

with k, l = 1, 2. we abbreviate the argument x in the eld hereafter except for the case necessary to
write. let us rst address the gauge transformation of a with the gauge function

g = (cid:18) g1

0

g2(cid:19) ,

where g1  g1 and g2  g2. it is expressed as

ag = g1dg + g1ag,

(2.3)

(2.4)

where the operator d = dx is the exterior derivative on the space mn . equation (2.3) brings the
gauge transformations of gauge and scalar elds.

i = g1

i aigi,

the generalized eld strength f is dened as usual and expressed as

f = da + a  a,

which is written in components as

f = (cid:18) f1 + h12h212  1

dh211

dh122

f2 + h21h121  2(cid:19) ,

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

where f1 and f2 are the eld strength of gauge elds a1 and a2, respectively and dh12 and dh21 are
the covariant derivatives of the scalar eld. equations of those quantities are written as

fi = dai + ai  ai,
dh12 = dh12 + a1h12  h12a2,

dh21 = dh21 + a2h21  h21a1.

(2.8)

according to eq.(2.4), we can easily nd the generalized eld strength transformed covariantly under the
gauge transformation;

which is written in components as

f g
i = g1

i figi,

dh g

12 = g1

1 dh12g2,

f g = g1f g,

dh g

2 dh21g1.

the generalized eld strength dened in eq.(2.6) satises the bianchi identity

df = df + af  f a = 0,

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

which is easily proved by use of the algebraic rule in the dierential geometry and very important
frequently used hereafter. it should be noted that the bianchi identity in eq.(2.10) does not yield any
restriction between gauge eld ai and scalar eld h12.

3 generalized chern-simons form

in order to introduce the generalized chern-simons form, we use the cartans homotopy formula

where p (a, f ) is an arbitrary function of a and f . the operator k is dened through the equation

p (a, f ) = (kd + dk)p (a, f ),

(3.1)

kp (a, f ) = z 1

0

dtktp (at, ft),

(3.2)

where at = ta and ft = tda + t2a  a. the operator kt in eq.(3.2) is an anti-dierential operator and
is dened as

through which the identity

ktat = 0,

ktft = ta,


t

= ktd + dkt

(3.3)

(3.4)

follows. equation (3.4) justies the cartans homotopy formula together with eq.(3.2).

it is easily see that the quantity tr f n is invariant under the gauge transformation and satises the

equation

dtr f n = tr (df n + af n  f na) = 0,

(3.5)

which is proved from the bianchi identity eq. (2.11). putting p (a, f ) = tr f n+1 in eq.(3.1), we nd
the transgression formula [5]

where 2n+1(a, f ) is the generalized chern-simons form and written as

tr f n+1 = d2n+1(a, f ),

2n+1(a, f ) = ktr f n+1 = (n + 1)z 1

0

dtaf n
t .

(3.6)

(3.7)

paying attention on ft = tf + (t2  t)a2, we obtain, after calculations of integral over t for n = 1 and
n = 2,

3(a, f ) = tr (cid:18)af 
5(a, f ) = tr (cid:18)af 2

(3.8)

(3.9)

equations (3.8) and (3.9) have the same forms as the ordinary chern-simons forms for n = 2 and n = 3,
respectively but it should be noted that the generalized gauge eld a and eld strength f are expressed
in matrix forms and contain the scalar eld as in eqs.(2.1) and (2.7).

let us investigate in more detail the generalized chern-simons form 2n+1 for n = 1 and n = 2.

inserting a and f in eqs.(2.1) and (2.7) into eq.(3.8), we nd

(3.12)

d tr (dh12  h21  h12  dh21) = 2tr (f1h12h21  dh12  dh21) ,

(3.13)

where dh12 = dh12 + a1h12 and dh21 = dh21  h21a1. in this case, h12 belongs to the fundamental
representation of the group g1. inserting a and f in eqs.(2.1) and (2.7) into eq.(3.9), we nd

1 h12h21  f1dh12  dh21(cid:1)  3tr (cid:0)f 2

2 h21h12  f2dh21  dh12(cid:1) .

we can nd from this equation much more compact equation that

d tr f1dh12  h21 = tr (cid:0)f 2

1 h12h21  f1h12f2h21  f1dh12  dh21(cid:1) ,

and the same equation replacing 1 by 2 and 2 by 1 also follows. when a2 = 0, eq.(3.16) leads to

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

d tr (f1dh12  h21) = tr (cid:0)f 2

1 h12h21  f1dh12  dh21(cid:1) .

these transgression formulas are easily justied by the direct calculations according to algebraic rules in
the dierential geometry.

4 generalized descent equation

in order to introduce the generalized descent equation [6], we incorporate the ghost eld [15] in the
generalized gauge eld a.

ac (x, ) = a(x, ) + c(x, ) = (cid:18) a1(x, ) + c1(x, )d

h21(x, )1

h12(x, )2

a2(x, ) + c2(x, )d(cid:19) ,

(4.1)

where c1(x, ) and c2(x, ) are ghost elds belonging to the adjoint representation of the groups g1
and g2, respectively and  is an argument of grassmann number in ghost space. ci(x, )(i = 1, 2) is
anti-hermitian. the generalized eld strength for ac is given as

where

f c = dac + ac  ac ,

d = dx,

d = d + d,
dx  d = d  dx,
 2
 = 0.
d  d 6= 0,

d = d,

i  d = d  i,

(4.2)

(4.3)

therefore, it is easy to see that the exterior derivative d satises the nilpotency d2 = 0. according to
the nilpotency of d and eq.(4.3) , the bianchi identity for f c

follows. by applying the horizontarity condition [17] to f c ,

df c + [ac , f c ] = 0

f c (x, )(cid:12)(cid:12)=0 = f (x)

4

(4.4)

(4.5)

we nd the brst transformations for elds involved.

ai = dci + aici  ciai = dci,
h12 = h12c2  c1h12,
ci = c 2
i ,

(4.6)

where the operator  stands for the brst transformation.

according to the nilpotency of d and the bianchi identity for f c in eq.(4.4), we obtain the trans-

gression formula for ac and f c same as in eq.(3.6).

if we consider the horizontarity condition [17]in eq.(4.5), the equation

tr f c n+1

= d 2n+1(ac , f c),

follows. here,

where

d 2n+1(ac , f c)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0 = d 2n+1(a, f )
2n+1(ac , f c ) = (n + 1)z 1

dtac f c n
t ,

0

by use of eq.(4.1), we expand 2n+1(ac , f c ) in power of the ghost eld c as

f c

t = tdac + t2ac  ac .

2n+1(ac , f c ) = 0

5 concluding remarks

from the standpoint of ncg that the higgs eld is a kind of gauge eld on the discrete space, we
incorporated the scalar eld h12 into the generalized gauge eld so as to generalize the chern-simons
form and descent equations. we obtained the generalized chern-simons form and its transgression
formula which include the scalar eld h12, for example, as in eqs.(3.15) and (3.16). the more compact
transgression formula follows in eq.(3.17). we also introduced the generalized descent equations in
eq.(4.13). the physical implications of these formulas will be explored in future work.
