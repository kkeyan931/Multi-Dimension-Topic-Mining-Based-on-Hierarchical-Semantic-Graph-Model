we employ the dirac-like equation for the gauge eld pro-
posed by majorana to obtain an action that is symmetric
under duality transformation. we also use the equivalence
between duality and chiral symmetry in this fermion-like for-
mulation to show how the maxwell action can be seen as a
mass term.

i. introduction

recently many papers have been published exploring
the issue of duality. this production has been motivated
by the relation between duality symmetry and theories
with strong and weak coupling [1]. another motivation
has been due to the presence of various duality sym-
metries in the string theories [2], specically, the target
space duality (t-duality), which is the symmetry of the
low energy eective eld theory and the s-duality (the
generalization of the electric/magnetic duality) which is
the invariance under the sl(2, r) duality transforma-
tions of the equations of motion for the bosonic sector of
the heterotic string. besides these, a very important in-
terest resides in the electrically and magnetically charged
black holes in the semiclassical view [3].

consequently, one of the rst dualities observed, the
electric-magnetic duality in maxwells equations, has re-
ceived great attention. however, the problem that arises
in preserving the duality symmetry and, at the same
time, the manifest lorentz covariance when the duality is
implemented is a very dicult obstacle. the main objec-
tive in the literature is to construct a duality symmetric
action which is also manifestly lorentz invariant.

schwarz and sen (ss) [4] proposed a dual invariant
action in which one more potential has been introduced
generalizing the t-duality symmetric string action [5] to
the case of the heterotic string. although this formula-
tion is not manifestly covariant it is classically and quan-
tically poincare invariant. one way to recover the man-
ifest lorentz invariance is to produce a non-polynomial

action, but this dicults the quantization. an alterna-
tive procedure is to use the hamiltonian formalism in
which, after the introduction of an innite set of elds
(this idea was rst used to analyze chiral bosons [6,7])
it is possible to get suitable duality conditions [8]. the
corresponding action, in ten dimensions, containing an
innite number of elds, is manifestly invariant under
electromagnetic duality transformation. after compacti-
cation to four dimensions it results into a local maxwell
action with electric and magnetic sources [9]. the study
of the dimensional dependence of the electromagnetic du-
ality was carried out in [10] and the connection between
duality and bosonization was shown in [11].

in the approach of the source-free maxwell theory in
an arbitrary background geometry, the duality symmetry
under general electric/magnetic eld rotations can be im-
plemented in a non-local way, as was introduced by deser
and teitelboim (dt) [12]. if the manifest covariance is
lost, we can construct quadratic actions for these mod-
els. it can be proved that this formulation is equivalent
to the schwarz-sen ones [13] via path integral formalism.
in reference [14] it was introduced sources into these non-
manifestly invariant actions and the covariantization of
this procedure has been accomplished in [15].

khoudeir and pantoja (kp) [16], getting back the non-
polynomial action scheme, suggested a lorentz invariant
version of the ss model by using an auxiliary time-like
constant vector in the action. this vector in fact vio-
lates the manifest covariance. pasti, sorokin and tonin
(pst) [17], making good use of this idea, proposed a
generalization of the dt, ss and kp duality symmetric
actions presenting the kp unit norm auxiliary vector as
a lorentz frame vector eld that can be related to the
gravitation interaction. the action constructed is mani-
festly covariant.

in this work we use the fermion-like formulation of
e. majorana [18,19] for the maxwell theory to propose
an action that is invariant under relativistic and dual-
ity transformations. fermion-like formulation for the
electromagnetic theory has been studied extensively by
dvoeglazov [20], but their connections with duality has
not been explored. the paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we review the work of majorana and ob-
tain a dirac-like expression for the maxwell equations in
the absence of sources. this femion-like formulation sug-
gest us to explore the chiral aspects in the theory. this
is accomplished in section 3 where we show that dual-

1

ity is a kind of chirality and in this context we propose
our action which is invariant under duality. in section 4
we demonstrate that the poincare generators obeys the
algebra on-shell. finally, the conclusion and nal obser-
vations are in section 5.

the well known maxwells equations are

now we want to look for a fermion-like formulation of
these equations based on the work of majorana [19]. in
his work majorana enhanced the role in electrodynamics
of the complex quantity f = e  ib, which was empha-
sized lately by weinberg [21] and others [22]. the main
motivation for this construction is the well known fact
that at statistical level, the electric and magnetic elds
e and b are connected (through the quantity e2 + b2)
to the local mean number of photons. hence, an ex-
pression for the probability quantum wave of a photon
can be given in terms of e and b. it provides a mean-
ing dierent of the usual one, where the electromagnetic
four-potential is introduced.

the rst step is to build elements and vectors that
allow us to couple two equations in only one. to accom-
plish this we note that equations (3) and (4), for j = 0,
can be rewritten as

i

e
t

(s  ) i b

(s  ) e

and

where

e =

 and b =

 .

(7)

note that we have dened s as three matrices 3  3,
by (si)jk = i ijk, where ijk is the levi-civita totally
antisymmetric tensor normalized so that 123 = 1 and
( s   ) b = (si)jk jbk.

with this denition the si matrices have the explicit

structure

2

and in this way the equation (5), for example, can be
rewritten as

i

ei
t

= (si)jk  j bk

(10)

in order to express equations (5) and (6) in a fermion-
like formulation we dene two important 6  6 matrices,

0 = (cid:18) i 0

0 i (cid:19) and ~ = (cid:18) 0 s

s 0 (cid:19) .

(11)

0 and ~ play the role of the dirac gamma matrices,
although they do not obey the usual gamma anticommu-
tation relations. we can also introduce a matrix that is
equivalent to diracs 5,

i 0 (cid:19)
5 = (cid:18) 0 i

(12)

where i is the 3  3 identity matrix. one can check that
{ 5 ,  } = 0 ,  = 0, . . . , 3.

with these denitions equations (5) and (6) can be put

in a more compact form

where s is

i


t

=

1
i

(s  ) 

 ( t + s   )  = 0 ,

s = (cid:18) 0 s

s 0 (cid:19) .

(13)

(14)

eq. (13) resembles the massless dirac equation, and one
can consider  as a (quantum) wave function for the
photon of the type

 = (cid:18) e

i b (cid:19)

and

(15)

(16)

 = (cid:0) e

ib (cid:1)

where  =  0 is an analog of the hermitian conju-
gated denition. notice that only e and b have physical
meaning and we will use e and b as auxiliary elds.
so, we can note that   = e2 + b2, with e = e and

b = b. now we can see the importance of the complex
notation in the construction of  which mimics a dirac
spinor.

in terms of the  matrices we may rewrite (13) as

iii. chirality and duality

transformations

we can also note that eq. (19) is invariant under the

chiral transformation

   = ei  5 

in terms of the elds e and b we have

e = cose  sinb
b = cosb + sine ,

(20)

(21)

which is a rotation and, particularly for  = /2 we
recover the duality transformation.

this invariance can also be veried in the following

lagrangian density

l = i   ( 0 t + ~   )  ,

(22)

or compactly l = i    , where the vectors  and
 must be taken conveniently as independent. in order
to provide the correct dimension of the action in the nat-
ural units ( = c = 1) we have introduced a parameter
 whose dimension is mass1 and does not modify the
equations of motion.

in terms of e and b eq. (22) is given by

l =  ( i e e + i b b  e s  b + b s  e ) ,

(23)

which is rst-order in time derivative and consequently
has a hamiltonian formulation. the physical quantities
of the theory are real and the main role of the auxiliary
elds is in the mathematical construction of the maxwell
equations as we will see below.

the equations of motion for e and b can be obtained

from the euler-lagrange equations

3

which are the hermitian conjugated of (5) and (6) respec-
tively. the equations of motion for e and b are obtained
from

l
e
i

= 0

and

l
b
i

= 0 ,

(28)

and as a result we have equations (5) and (6).

equations (1) and (2) for  = 0, comes from the fact
that e and b are orthogonal to the propagation vector,
namely

k  e = 0

and

k  b = 0 .

(29)

the mass term. it is well known that a term like  
breaks the chiral invariance.
in this formulation it is
given by

  = e  e  b  b .

(30)

which resembles the maxwell lagrangian density (with
e = e, b = b) and highlights the connection between
chiral symmetry and duality. a mass term in the dirac-
form is not invariant under chiral transformation and the
maxwell lagrangian is not invariant under duality trans-
formation.

iv. the generators of the poincar e

algebra

notice that, as the schwarz-sen model, eq.

(23) is
not a lorentz scalar. however, it is our task now to
demonstrate that the theory is relativistically invariant
as it obeys the poincare algebra.

we have computed the generators of the poincare al-
gebra in the usual way, that is, by using the energy-
momentum tensor as

 =

l

( i)

i
x  g l

(31)

where i are the basic elds ei(e
quently the linear and angular momenta are given by,

i ) and bi(b

i ). conse-

h = p0 = z d3 x 00
=  z d3 x [ e s   b  b s   e ]

pk = z d3 x 0k

= i  z d3 x [ e k e + b k b ]

,

(32)

and

m = i  z d3 x [ x ( e  e + b  b )

where ,  = 0, . . . , 3 and k = 1, . . . , 3. finally it can
be shown in a straightforward calculation that they obey
the poincare algebra on-shell, i.e.,

{ pk , p0 } = 0
{ m , p0 } = 0
{ m , pk } = gk p  gk p
{ m0 , pk } = gk p0

{ m , m } = g m  g m

 g m  g m .

(34)

so, we have demonstrated that the action in eq.
(23)
describes a theory that is relativistically invariant on-
shell.

v. conclusions

we have analyzed an already known fermion-like for-
mulation for the electromagnetic theory and proposed a
corresponding lagrangian invariant under duality trans-
formation. this invariance can be seen as a particular
case of chiral transformation in the fermion-like formula-
tion. we have carried out our analysis in order to ver-
ify the poincare invariance of this formulation, and have
found that, although not being manifestly covariant, it
is relativistically invariant on-shell. we also have com-
pared the chiral variant mass term with the maxwell la-
grangian, which is duality noninvariant. as a perspective
for the future we intend to study the duality symmetry
in others formulations of the electromagnetism.
