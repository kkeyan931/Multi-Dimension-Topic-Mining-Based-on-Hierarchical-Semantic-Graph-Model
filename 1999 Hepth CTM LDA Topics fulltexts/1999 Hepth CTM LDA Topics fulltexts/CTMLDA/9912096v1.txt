abstract

we discuss the microscopic states of the extremal btz black holes. de-

generacy of the primary states corresponding to the extremal btz black holes

in the boundary n=(4,4) scft is obtained by utilizing the elliptic genus and

the unitary representation theory of n=4 sca. the degeneracy is consistent

with the bekenstein-hawking entropy.

1 introduction

one of the challenging problems in quantum gravity is to understand the microscopic

properties of black holes,

in particular, the statistical origin of the bekenstein-

hawking entropy. new idea for an explanation of the origin of the bekenstein-

hawking entropy has been provided by recent development of our understanding of

non-perturbative superstring theory. it is based on the d-brane description of black

holes[1] and the ads/cft correspondence[2, 3, 4]. these are much related with

each other under the maldacena duality[2].

three-dimensional einstein equation with negative cosmological constant has

the solutions called the btz black holes[5, 6]. these black holes have locally ads3

geometry. via the ads3/cft2 correspondence, one can also hope to be able to

analyze the microscopic properties of the btz black holes based on a local eld

theory on the boundary. innite dimensional algebra of two-dimensional conformal

symmetry, that is, the virasoro algebra, provides an important clue for our un-

derstanding the correspondence and the maldacena duality. the pioneering work

is stromingers counting of microscopic states of the btz black holes[7]. but the

qualitative aspects of this counting still remain to be obscure .

in this paper, we will discuss the three-dimensional extremal btz black holes

in the context of the maldacena duality. although this duality has been conjec-

tural yet, various check has been carried out. (see [8] and references therein.) in

this perspective, the extremal btz black holes can be identied with the primary

states which are 1/2 bps states in the n=(4,4) two-dimensional supersymmetric

-model. this -model has a quantity called elliptic genus convenient to count the

degeneracy of these states. we actually count the microscopic states of the ex-

tremal btz black holes with this identication by using the elliptic genus and the

unitary representation theory of the n=4 superconformal algebra. the microscopic

entropy of these black holes obtained by this counting agrees with the entropy a la

bekenstein-hawking.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we will summarize the previous

results about the btz black holes from the perspective of the ads3/cft2 corre-

1

spondence in a pure quantum gravity and in non-perturbative superstring theory,

i.e., the maldacena duality. in section 3, after a brief introduction of n=4 supercon-

formal algebra, black hole states are discussed in the unitary representation theory.

in section 4, some facts about the elliptic genus of the n=(4,4) supersymmetric

-model are reviewed. in section 5, we count the number of 1/8 bps states in the

d1-d5 brane system in iib supergravity via the elliptic genus of this -model and

then nally count the microscopic states of the extremal btz black holes. in section

6, some other related topics are discussed.

2 btz black holes and ads3/cft2 correspon-

dence

2.1 btz black holes in a three-dimensional pure quantum

gravity

the btz black holes 3 are three-dimensional black holes specied by their mass m
and angular momenta j, where |j|  ml. in terms of the schwarzschild coordinates
(t, , r), with the ranges  < t < +, 0   < 2 and 0 < r < +, the black
hole metric ds2

has the form

btz(j,m )

ds2

btz(j,m )  n 2(dt)2 + n2(dr)2 + r2(d + n dt)2,

where n and n  are the functions of the radial coordinate r

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

the outer and inner horizons are located respectively at r = r+ and r = r. infor-
mation about the mass and angular momentum is encoded in r by

extremal. it holds r+ = r and then the outer and inner horizons coincide with
each other. when ml > |j|, it is called non-extremal. and in the case of j = 0 and
ml = l/8g, the geometry corresponds to the global ads3.

the outer horizon of these solutions has nite area. the semiclassical argument

leads the nite bekenstein-hawking entropy:

(a : area of the outer horizon)

(2.4)

quantization of three-dimensional pure gravity with negative cosmological con-

stant is discussed in [9]. it is prescribed, through the detailed analysis of brown-

henneauxs asymptotic virasoro symmetry[10], as the geometric quantization of the

virasoro coadjoint orbits of the virasoro central charge c = 3l/2g.

the btz black holes and the ads3 correspond to the primary states (highest

weight states) of the virasoro algebra of brown-henneaux4:

btz(j,m )  |j, mi  |hi  |hi,
ads3  |vaci  |0i  |0i,

where

btz(m l,m )  |ml, mi  |hi  |

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the total hilbert space of the theory, which includes excited states (secondary
states), is obtained by the tensor products vh  vh of the verma modules of the
virasoro algebra. (vh and vh are respectively the verma modules of the left-moving
and right-moving sectors.) these verma modules constitute the unitary irreducible
representations of the virasoro algebra. we can identify the states excited by ln
4strictly speaking, these states correspond to the geometry of the exterior of outer horizon of

the btz black holes and the geometry without the origin of the ads3 respectively

3

in the verma module with massive gravitons on the corresponding background ge-

ometry.

in view of the ads3/cft2 correspondence, this hilbert space should be realized

by the corresponding boundary cft. in fact it was done[9] based on the liouville

eld x with a specic background charge. the action is given by

s[x] =

(2.9)

where r is the riemann tensor of a xed kahler metric on p1. the stress tensor

t (z) has the form

t (z) =

2

xx(z) + 02x(z),

(2.10)

and provides the generators of the virasoro algebra with the central charge 1 +

122
0 = 1 + 3l/2g. this central charge is the same as that of virasoro algebra of

brown-henneaux in the semiclassical limit, i.e., l/g  1. the fock space fk
built on the fock vacuum |ki, which is introduced as the state obtained from the
ordinary sl2(c)-invariant vacuum |0i by the relation |ki = limz0 eikx(z)|0i.

the btz black hole states (2.5) can be identied with the following fock vacuum:

btz(j,m )  |j, mi  |k(j,m )i  |k(j,m )i,

(2.11)

where k(j,m ) and k(j,m ) are given by

k(j,m )  is l
k(j,m )  is l

.

ads3 state (2.6) can be identied with the sl2(c)-invariant vacuum:

ads3  |vaci  |0i  |0i.

(2.12)

(2.13)

the fock spaces fk fk built on these primary states give the unitary irreducible
representations of the virasoro algebra with c = 1 + 3l/2g, and coincide with the

physical hilbert space of the previous quantization of three-dimensional pure gravity.

5similar arguments hold for the anti-holomorphic (right-moving) part.

4

to summarize, in this correspondence of three-dimensional pure gravity and the

boundary cft, the btz black holes appear as the primary states of the virasoro

algebra with c = 3l/2g in both descriptions. this result may not be desirable for

the counting of microscopic states of the btz black holes. we cannot count in

principle the degeneracy of these primary states with this boundary theory, since

this liouville eld theory has continuum spectrum of primary states.

2.2 btz black holes and maldacena duality

nextly, we consider the ads3/cft2 correspondence in superstring theory. through

the analysis of the near horizon limit of the bps solitonic solution of iib supergrav-

ity, which describes the bound state of q1 d1-branes and q5 d5-branes, maldacena

has conjectured in [2],

iib superstring theory on (ads3  s3)q1q5  m4

(m4 = k3 or t 4)

two-dimensional n=(4,4) supersymmetric -model

m dual

on the higgs branch of world volume theory of the d1-d5 system.

here, we indicated the dependence of the radius of ads3 and s3 on q1q5 (see below).

we call simply this duality as the maldacena duality.

we will discuss mainly the case of m4 = k3 in the following. the n=(4,4)

-model can be regarded as the -model on the target space of the k-th symmetric

product of k3 [11, 12], where

k = q1q5 + 1.

(2.14)

since the symmetric product is 4k-dimensional hyper-kahler manifold, it has au-

tomatically the n=(4,4) superconformal symmetry. the virasoro subalgebra and

zero mode of the su(2) current algebra may be identied with the virasoro algebra
of brown-henneaux on the boundary of ads3 and the isometry of s3, respectively.

we will see in detail about the n=4 superconformal algebra in section 3.

the extremal btz black holes can also be obtained as the near horizon limit

of the similar bps solitonic solutions of iib supergravity. therefore we can expect

5

that the extremal btz black holes can be analyzed by this n=(4,4) -model.

we summarize some related facts of iib supergravity here.

iib supergravity
on s1  k3 whose radius and volume are r and (2)42v has the bps solitonic

(2.19)

this solution corresponds to the conguration of the bound state of q5 d5-
branes wrapping on k3  s1 and q1 d1-branes wrapping on s1 with n units of
kk momenta along s1, i.e., x5-direction, and preserves four supercharges. so it is

a 1/8 bps state[1].

here we can get the extremal btz black hole as the near horizon limit of the

geometry (2.15)[14, 13]. the near horizon limit is dened as

  0,

with

u 

r
 , r and v xed.

in this limit, the metric (2.15) describes (btz(m l,m )  s3)q1q5  k3 with ml =
j = n. the radius of ads3 and s3 coincide and become l = (gst/v1/2r)q1q5.
and the three-dimensional eective newton constant on btz(n,n/l) is given by

g(3)

e = gst/(4v

henneauxs virasoro symmetry with central charge,

c =

2g(3)
e

= 6q1q5.

(2.20)

this is the same as the central charge of the n=(4,4) -model at the semiclassical
limit q1q5  1. the bekenstein-hawking entropy becomes

s =

e

= 2qq1q5n ,

(2.21)

which is valid in the semiclassical region n  q1q5  1.

if one accepts the maldacena duality, the extremal black hole should be identied

with the primary state

(2.22)

of the n=(4,4) -model. one can ask whether the entropy (2.21) can be regarded as

the degeneracy of the primary state (2.22) of this n=(4,4) -model. in the sequel,

we will argue this question and answer yes.

3 n=4 superconformal symmetry

n=(4,4) -model is known to be nite to all orders of perturbation and to be con-

formal invariant at the quantum level. thus the states of the -model on the k-th

symmetric product6, skk3, constitute the unitary irreducible representations of the

underlying n=4 superconformal algebra (n=4 sca).

(h,l) and massless repre-

the massive representations have the same number of bosonic and fermionic

states at each level and the witten index is equal to zero. these representations

correspond to the representations which have spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

the witten index of the massless representations is non-zero. these representations

are the representations which have unbroken supersymmetry. the primary states

of massless representations have dimension h = k/4 = c/24. these are the ground

states of the r-sector.

identication of the black hole states

as argued in section 2.2, the extremal btz black hole will correspond to the primary

state (2.22) of the n=(4,4) -model. it is a virasoro primary state of the underlying

n=4 sca. the fact that the extremal btz black holes are the 1/2 bps states with

respect to the poincare supersymmetry in three-dimension7 implies that this primary
(h,l) mk
state is in the tensor product of massive and massless representations mk
which is built on

0(l)

|h = n +

(3.9)

actually we can proceed further. since the extremal btz black holes do not have
the conserved charge corresponding to isospin l and l, the primary state (2.22) may
be identied with the virasoro primary state having vanishing isospins l = l = 0 in

4 elliptic genus for -model on symmetric prod-

uct of k3

to count the number of 1/2 bps states in the n=(4,4) -model, the so-called

elliptic genus is a convenient tool. we summarize some properties of the elliptic

genus emphasizing its modular transform and examine it from the perspective of

n=4 sca.

4.1 elliptic genus as a weak jacobi form

the elliptic genus of target space m is dened by the following trace in the r-r

sector of the underlying n=(2,2) superconformal eld theory8.

z[m](, z) = trrr(1)j0 j0ql0 c

24 q l0 c

(4.1)

specic value.

: elliptic extension of dirac genus

11

where j0 and j0 are the integral n=2 u(1) charges of the left-moving and the right-
moving sectors9. the elliptic genus is independent of  by virtue of supersymmetry

of the r-sector. the contribution of the right-moving sector is only from the ground

states. but all states in the left-moving sector contribute to z[m](, z). so the

elliptic genus z[m](, z) is a desired quantity for counting of the 1/2 bps states.

the following theorem is known about this elliptic genus. (see [17] in detail.)

theorem 1. if the target space m of the -model is an even-dimensional calabi-

yau manifold, then the elliptic genus z[m](, z) is a weak jacobi form of weight 0

and index d/2(d = dimc m) without character.

weak jacobi form in the above theorem is dened as follows[18].

denition. a function (, z) is called a weak jacobi form of weight k  z and
index m  z>0/2 without character, if it satises (i)(iv):

(i) (, z) is a holomorphic function with respect to   h+ (h+ : upper half

plane) and z  c.

(iv) (, z) has the fourier expansion of the form

xr=

c(n, r)qnyr

(q = e2i , y = e2iz).

when m is k3, the elliptic genus z[k3](, z) becomes a weak jacobi form

of weight 0 and index 1 without character. an actual calculation of the n=(4,4)

supersymmetric -model on k3[19, 20] determines it explicitly as

z[k3](, z) = 24(, z)k 2(, z),

where

we need the following theorem about weak jacobi form[17, 18].

if we assign weights 4, 6 and 2 respectively to e4( ), e6( )10 and
theorem 2.
(, z), any weak jacobi form of weight 2l (l  z0) and index k (k  z0) can be
expressed as

g2l+2k(e4( ), e6( ), (, z))k 2k(, z),

where g2l+2k(e4, e6, ) is a homogenious polynomial of weight (2l + 2k) and its
degree as a polynomial in  is at most k.

skk3 is 2k-dimensional calabi-yau manifold. the elliptic genus z[skk3](, z)

becomes a weak jacobi form of weight 0 and index k. according to theorem 2, it

has the following form:

z[skk3](, z) = g2k(e4( ), e6( ), (, z))k 2k(, z).

the n=(4,4) -model on the target space of k3 has been analyzed in detail by

eguchi et.al.[19] in the context of a compactication of string theory on k3. the

elliptic extension of the hirzebruch signature of k3 can be represented by the char-

we have used eq.(3.8) to obtain the last equality in (4.6). the degeneracy of the
massive primary states in the left-moving sector is encoded in f ( ). the coecient

an is the degeneracy of the massive primary states of h = n + 1/4.

the function f ( ) can be determined by combining two expressions of elliptic

genus (4.2) and (4.6),

now, we will turn to the case of the symmetric product. the elliptic genus

of skk3 can be also expanded by the characters of the underlying n=4 sca. in

14

although the characters of the massless representations with l 6= 0 may appear in
z[skk3](, z+1/2), we can reduce them to l = 0 by applying (3.8) recursively. a(l)
n in
(4.12) provides the degeneracy of the representation mk
0(l) with h = n+ k/4
and isospin l. pl a(l)
0(l) with

n provides the number of the representations mk

(h,l) mk

(h,l) mk

h = n + k/4.

because of eq.(4.4), the spectrum of the massive primary states of this -model
on skk3 also becomes discrete and all states have dimension h = z0 + k/4 in
z[skk3](, z + 1/2). this corresponds to the fact the extremal btz black holes

have the discrete mass n/l in the context of the maldacena duality.

the function fl( ) (or pl fl( )) in eq.(4.11) can be determined in principle by

an analogous way with the case of k3. but it is a hard task to obtain the exact

functional form of z[skk3](, z) such as (4.5) for the case of general k. however,

as discussed in section 2.2, what we need for the counting of the microscopic states

comparable with the bekenstein-hawking entropy is the asymptotic form of a(l)

n (or
n ) at n  , since eq.(2.21) is valid for the region n  q1q5  1. we will

consider this asymptotic form in the next section.

pl a(l)

5 state counting via the n=(4,4) -model

in this section, we will discuss the degeneracy of 1/8 bps states of the d1-d5 system

in iib superstring theory and the degeneracy of the primary states corresponding

to the extremal btz black holes. in the previous section, we obtain two dierent

expressions of the elliptic genus of skk3. we will rst use the expression in terms

of a weak jacobi form and count the number of the 1/8 bps states by using a

tauberian theorem. then using the expression in terms of the characters of n=4

sca, we will discuss the degeneracy of the massive primary states and obtain the

microscopic entropy of the corresponding extremal btz black holes.

15

5.1 counting the 1/8 bps states

let us start by studying the asymptotic behavior of the elliptic genus z[skk3](, 1/2)
as   012. due to the structure theorem the elliptic genus has the form (4.4)

z[skk3](,

1
2

) = g2k(cid:18)e4( ), e6( ), (,

1
2

)(cid:19) k 2k(,

1
2

).

the asymptotics can be obtained from those of the constituents in (4.4). (, 1/2),
e4( ) and e6( ) behave as (, 1/2)  (1/12)(i )2, e4( )  1(i )4, and
e6( )  (1)(i )6. therefore the asymptotics of g2k becomes

g2k(,

)  c(k)(i )2k

as   0,

(5.1)

1
2

where c(k) is a constant which depends on k and the polynomial form of g2k.
the asymptotics of k 2(, 1/2) can be read from 2(, 0)  1(i ) 1
2 and ( )

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

therefore, gathering these asymptotics, we obtain

z[skk3](,

1
2

)  c(k)(i )0e

ik
2

as   0.

(cid:16)c(k) = (1)kc(k)(cid:17)

the elliptic genus has the fourier expansion of the form

z[skk3](,

2

) =

xn=0

anqn.

again, due to the structure theorem, the coecients satisfy an  an+1. (see ap-
pendix a for the explicit fourier expansions of various functions.) each coecient

an represent the number of the 1/2 bps states of h = n + k/4 in the n=(4,4) -

model. this is the number of the 1/8 bps states of the mass specied by h = n+k/4

in the d1-d5 system [1, 14]. we can estimate the asymptotic form of an by using

the following tauberian theorem[21, 22].

theorem 3. let f ( ) be a function

f ( ) = q xn=0

anqn

(q = e2i )

which satises following conditions:
12   0 def  = it (t  r>0), and t  0.

(i) f ( ) is a holomorphic function on h+.

(ii) an  r and an  an+1 for all n.
(iii) there exist c  c, d  r and n  r>0 such that

to know the asymptotic behavior of pl fl( ) as   0.
totics of pl fl( ) becomes tractable if we can properly estimate the constituents of

n , we may again utilize the tauberian theorem. for this purpose we need

since we have obtained the asymptotics of the elliptic genus (5.3), the asymp-

the massless and massive characters. let us remind that the character of massive

13we can expect c(k) is not large number due to the explicit example of lower k. (see [17].)

17

(h,l) is given by eq.(3.3). the asymptotic behavior of the character

representation mk
of dsu(2)k of the isospin l, eq.(3.4), is given by[21, 22]

turns out to come from the part of the massive representations. we can neglect the

contribution of the massless representations in the asymptotics.

now we can obtain the asymptotic behavior of pl fl( ). taking the limit   0

(5.14)

therefore, we conclude that the degeneracy of the massive primary state of the
dimension h = n + k/4 at n   is given by eq.(5.14).

according to the argument in section 3.2, the degeneracy of the primary state

(3.9) corresponds to the degeneracy of the microscopic states of the extremal btz
black hole btz(n,n/l). at the limit n  k  115, that is, the semiclassical limit of
three-dimensional gravity, the degeneracy of the state (2.22) becomes

n 1

2 exp(2q(k  1)n)

as n  ,

(5.15)

where k = q1q5 + 1. the logarithm of eq.(5.15) can be regarded as the microscopic

entropy of the extremal btz black hole with ml = j = n. it becomes

smicro = 2qq1q5n + o(log n, log c(k)).

(5.16)

this completely agrees with the entropy formula eq.(2.21). this provides a justi-

cation of the identication of the extremal btz black hole states with the primary

states (2.22) of the n=(4,4) -model.

6 discussion

until now, our study is limited to the case of the extremal btz black holes. the

non-extremal btz black holes can also appear as the near horizon geometry of the

non-bps solitonic solutions in iib supergravity. according to the duality, the non-

extremal btz black holes may be also identied with the virasoro primary states

|h, l = 0i  |h, l = 0i with h, h >

k
4

,

(6.1)

in the corresponding n=(4,4) -model.

these states are in the tensor product of the massive representations both in the

left and right moving sectors. so we must consider not the elliptic genus but the full

partition function of the n=(4,4) -model for the counting of the degeneracy of the

states. it is known that the full partition function, which depends on the moduli
of skk3, has the contributions from the massive primary states of h = q>0 + k/4

(q : rational numbers)[19]. therefore, the patition function and the counterparts

of pl fl( ) can not have the forms (5.4) and (5.13). so the tauberian theorem

can not be applied to the counting of the primary state (6.1). we need the further

investigations for the well-dened counting of the microscopic states of the non-

extremal btz black holes.

through this paper, we have discussed only the case of m4 = k3. the similar
arguments in section 2.2 hold for the case of m4 = t 4. however the elliptic genus of

the corresponding n=(4,4) -model vanishes identically, since this -model has the

extra u(1)4 symmetry other than n=4 superconformal symmetry. so one cannot

count the degeneracy of the state (2.22) by means of the elliptic genus. in [23], the

counting of the 1/8 bps states has been argued by using another topological index

called new supersymmetric index. and they pointed out that the representations

of large n=4 superconformal algebra must be considered. we may expect that the

similar argument in this paper can be carried out via the relation between this new

supersymmetric index and the characters of large n=4 superconformal algebra.
