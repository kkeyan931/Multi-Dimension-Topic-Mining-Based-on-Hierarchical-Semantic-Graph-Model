this, witten conjectured {$9803131$} approach study large n non-conformal non-supersymmetric eld theories pure qcd (in paper pure qcd means pure yang-mills theory) strong coupling using string theory

particular aspects consider paper). 2) pure qcd2 theory plane glueball mass gap, since gluons degrees freedom. thus, contrary qcd3 qcd4 cases, supergravity description qcd2 supposed predict existence mass gap. so, paper, try test whether mass gap predicted supergravity description. paper, consider non-rotating(see section 2) rotating(see section 3) supergravity backgrounds studying qcd2.

introduction, pure qcd2 plane mass gap procedure cannot correct. reason comes fact mass gap supersymmetry restoration energy order temperature . means cannot expect fermions decouple eld theory computed mass gap. so, seems predicting mass gap pure qcd2 rather theory containing fermions. also seems suggest one cannot conclude anything existence mass gap qcd3 qcd4 supergravity using

therefore, since pure qcd2 mass gap, conclusion must fermions scalars decouple mass gap scale. conclusion also reached {$9711200$}, shown rotating m2, m5 d3-branes fermions get masses order p1 a/u+ .

paper considered correspondence qcd2 supergrav- ity. test correspondence, tried see supergravity construction qcd2 predicts mass gap. found mass gap predicted using non- rotating rotating black d2-branes supergravity backgrounds. since pure qcd2 mass gap, suggests supergravity construction qcd2 fully reproduce dynamics pure qcd2. argued sections 2 3, reason that, non-rotating rotating supergravity backgrounds, dual eld theory found mass gap contained fermions therefore pure qcd2. 6 found mass gap rotating d2-branes seen conrmation results {$9711200$}, since results precisely explain discrepancy supergravity construction qcd2 pure qcd2. already stated, seems problems mass gap calculation supergravity construction qcd2 also apply qcd3 qcd4 cases, non-rotating rotating d-branes. so, concluded {$9711200$}, seems priori reason believe supergravity constructions qcd3 qcd4 say anything existence mass gaps pure qcd3 pure qcd4. acknowledgements would like thank p. h.
