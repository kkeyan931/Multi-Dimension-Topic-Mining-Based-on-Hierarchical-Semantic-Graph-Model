(b.14) suitable diagonal change basis twisted group algebra, validity (b.14) always achieved . finally, left transversal subgroup h g set representatives h\g, i.e. subset g contains precisely one element left coset hx. center twisted group algebra corresponds f -regular classes follows . let {g1, g2, ..., g} set representatives f -regular classes, and, i, ti left transversal conjugacy class cgi gi. elements x hti bhbgi(bh)1 form basis center. particular, f standard, sums x hcgi bh (b.15) (b.16) f -regular conjugacy classes constitute basis center. number inequivalent irreducible representations twisted group algebra equal dimension center (since algebra semisimple), hence number regular conjugacy classes. notice, though, canonical correspondence irreducible representations conjugacy classes. b.4 commutator cocycles abelian groups consider nite groups g abelian. f -regular elements characterized (b.17) f (g, h) = f (h, g) h g . 51 further, abelian case subset greg f -regular elements g actually subgroup. namely, g1 g2 regular, i.e. bgibh = bhbgi = 1, 2 h cgi = g, one (b.18) f (g1, g2) bg1g2bh = bg1bg2bh = bg1bhbg2 = bhbg1bg2 = bh f (g1, g2) bg1g2 h g, hence bg1g2 regular well. use term bi-homomorphism every function f : g g c (b.19) satises f (g1g2, g3) = f (g1, g3)f (g2, g3) f (g1, g2g3) = f (g1, g2)f (g1, g3) (b.20) g1, g2, g3 g. may noted every bi-homomorphism obeys (b.2) hence constitutes two-cocycle abelian group g. property important us. also, interested denite bi-homomorphisms rather cohomology classes. particular one may deal bi-homomorphisms non-trivial even though cohomologically trivial. 16 bi-homomorphism f g called alternating via bi-homomorphism property implies (without using abelianness g) anti- symmetry property 17 f (g, g) = 1 g g , (b.21) f (h, g) = (f (g, h))1 g, h g . (b.22) every alternating bi-homomorphism f abelian group g written (see e.g.  ) commutator cocycle two-cocycle f ff g, i.e. f (g, h) = f (g, h)/f (h, g) (b.23) g, h g. note f determines cohomology class f ; put dierently, f depends f cohomology class f . moreover, since cohomologically trivial cocycles twisted group algebra isomorphic ordinary group algebra, cocycles commutator cocycle trivial (i.e. 1). follows distinct cohomology classes cocycles also possess distinct commutator cocycles. subgroup f -regular elements expressed terms commutator cocycle (b.24) greg f = gf , gf := {h g | f (h, g) = 1 g g} . (b.25) indeed subgroup g, denition symmetric two arguments f . (in application main text, gf =u untwisted stabilizer stabilizer subgroup g.) 16 example provided g = z2 z2, bi-homomorphism f obeying f (1, j) = 1 = f (j, j) j z2 z2, values f (j, j) 1. situation e.g. realized d4 level 2 wzw theory. 17 function f present simple current relation (a.12) constitutes alternating bi-homomor- phism abelian simple current group g. application simple current extensions, antisymmetry property holds reason described around (a.17). 52 b.5 representation theory traces irreducible representations cf g labelled characters center greg f = gf . let r d-dimensional irreducible representation twisted group algebra cf g abelian group g, let r irreducible representation g (in particular r one-dimensional). r r, maps bg cf g (r r)(bg) := r(bg) r(g) , (b.26) irreducible representation cf g dimension d. shown irreducible representations cf g related way, thus particular dimension. artin--wedderburn theorem |g| = dim(cf g) = d2 nirr.rep. .

(b.31) since greg subgroup g, g 6 greg also gh greg h greg; particular, gh identity element, therefore trr bgh = 0. semisimple algebra regular representation direct sum inequivalent irreducible representations, appearing multiplicity 1. therefore identity r (bgh) = r (bg) r (bh) = (bh) r (bg) , follows help (b.29), allows us compute 0 = trr bgh = x greg trr bgh = x greg (h) trr bg (b.32) (b.33) 53 h greg. fourier-transforming relation greg nally yields trr greg g 6 greg, thus proving (b.30). also x g (g) = ggreg (g) bg = 0 (b.34) |greg = every g g every greg. derived follows. g greg result follows immediately fact irreducible representation central elements represented multiples unit matrix. suppose g 6 greg; completeness g- characters implies sums (b.35) (gh) = 0 x g g-characters vanish every h greg. means x (h) x greg g |greg = (g) = 0 .
