(101) one way understand remarkable agreement consider commutator scalars expressed terms physical radius (97). terms dimensionless matrices, commutator becomes see xed r s, matrices become nearly commuting n becomes large. hence nonabelian character solution diminishes surprising d0-brane results match derived abelian d2-brane theory. given limitations nonabelian action discussed above, i.e., possible commutator corrections higher orders f , one would conclude nonabelian d0-brane calculations trusted small commutators. naively, one would expect would translate restricting size noncommutative sphere small compared string scale. true restriction taylor expansion square root potential (100) converge rapidly, requires r << ns. hence large n, one may consider radii far larger string scale. one may also argue radius must remain small since low energy action, (90) (92), simply inapplicable d0-branes become separated string scale. is, low energy modes masses order 1/s, one could ignore oscillator excitations determining physics open string sector. latter true, radius r correct scale characterize separation d0-branes. rather one think d0-branes forming area elements noncommutative two- sphere . typical size area elements 4r2/n, r << ns, typical separations d0-branes still much less string scale, required. latter result conrmed considering frequency perturbations extremum (79). one nds 2 = n(n + 1)f 2 large n n angular quantum number uctuation mode noncommutative sphere. r0 << ns f << 1/(ns). hence see energy low energy excitations far string mass scale, adequately described low energy world-volume action. able consider large r allows us match onto regime membrane action dual d2-brane calculations also applicable. course, systems like d2- brane carrying large gauge eld ux recently interest connections noncommutative gauge theories, e.g., . following analysis ref. {$9908142$}, one nds regime upon focussed precisely standard string coupling g much smaller eective string coupling gs theory described terms noncommutative variables, i.e., 2r2 n g gs << gs . (102) thus ordinary gauge theory provides ecient description d2-branes, i.e., system essentially abelian. would interesting try study system regime noncommutative variables proved ecient. ultimately, one expects d2- brane theory give rise nonabelian d0-brane physics, making connection precise prove illuminating. still nonabelian d0- abelian d2-brane calculations simply dual formulations physical system, large nite n, d2-brane framework still 27 capture small nite noncommutative properties found d0-brane calculations. ref. {$9908142$} tells us dierence formulating d2-brane theory terms ordinary noncommutative gauge theory higher derivative corrections world-volume action. perhaps noncommutative aspects bound state system appear d2-brane formalism inclusion certain higher derivative corrections abelian action, (1) (3). ordinarily terms would ignored basis contributions give small corrections, present case, precisely small 1/n corrections interest. thus advocating resolving discrepancies dual pictures requires determining corrections formalisms, e.g., higher order commutator corrections d0-branes, higher derivative corrections d2-branes. finally, arguing merits calculations section 6, must still acknowledge one signicant shortcoming namely supergravity background consistent back- ground solution type iia supergravity equations motion. one could argue background might approximated placing d0-branes asymptotic region far d2-brane, focusing small region gradients background elds neglected. one take seriously details calculations. example, potentials (95) (100) fact unstable since dominated r3 term large radius. however, instability become apparent radii order 1/f , gravitational eects total energy four-form enclosed region order 1. hence gravitational back-reaction cannot neglected scale, conclude instability simply artifact chosing consistent solution background. however, calculations section 6 presented spirit toy calculation illustrate eects new nonabelian interactions appearing action, (90) (92), particular demonstrate dielectric eect d-branes. detailed examination issues realistic backgrounds preparation . acknowledgments research supported nserc canada fonds fcar du quebec. would like acknowledge useful conversations neil constable, cliord johnson, aki hashimoto, joe polchinski, oyvind tafjord, washington taylor mark van raamsdonk. research itp, ucsb supported nsf grant phy94-07194. paper nal stages preparation, informed washington taylor mark van raamsdonk recent work {$9503124$}, signicant overlap material sections 3 4.
