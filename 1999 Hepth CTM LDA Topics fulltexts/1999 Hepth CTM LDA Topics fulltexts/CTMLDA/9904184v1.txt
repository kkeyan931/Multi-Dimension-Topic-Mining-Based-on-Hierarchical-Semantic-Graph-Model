found is a general form of static solutions in exactly solvable models of 2d

dilaton gravity at nite temperature. we reveal a possibility for the existence

of everywhere regular solutions including black holes, semi-innite throats

and star-like congurations. in particular, we consider the bose-parker-peleg

(bpp) model which possesses a semi-innite throat and analyze it at nite

temperature. we also suggest generalization of the bpp model in which the

appearance of semi-innite throat has a generic character and does not need

special ne tuning between parameters of the solution.

i. introduction

hawkings discovery of black hole evaporation posed the question about the nal fate of

a black hole. this issue is far from being fully understood but exploiting two-dimensional

(2d) models gained insight into this intriguing puzzle.

in particular, bose, parker and

peleg (bpp) suggested the exactly solvable modication of the callan-giddings-harvey-

strominger (cghs) model [1] in which a black hole evaporates leaving, as an end state, a

regular static semi-innite throat [2]. the existence of such a type of solution motivates an

interest to nding regular static solutions in 2d dilaton gravity in a more general setting.

apart from the possible role of such solutions as remnants after the evaporation of

black hole, this task is also motivated by the necessity to elucidate the structure of exactly

solvable solutions (of any types) in dilaton gravity.

in the paper [3] the approach was

1

suggested which was based on a treatment of non linear  model. a more simple approach

appealing directly to the properties of the action coecient as functions of a dilaton eld

was proposed in [4] where it was also shown that the general structure of found exactly

solvable models encompasses all known particular ones. the paper [4] deals only with black

holes with a regular horizon. correspondingly, the temperature is put equal to the hawking

one. in the present paper we consider another types of a metric and nd the general form

of static solutions in exactly solvable models at an arbitrary temperature.

we carry out the analysis of the obtained general solutions for the bpp model and

generalizations of it which, as well as bpp ones, do not contain singularities at nite values of

a dilaton eld. it turns out that in these models there exists a rather rich family of solutions

regular everywhere. in spite of the term throat in 1+1 dimensional world is somewhat

conditional, we will use it, following [2], to denote any regular geodesically complete geometry

extending to innity (which for deniteness is supposed to be a left one) where its curvature

is nonzero. if a metric is at there, we will speak about a soliton-like conguration. it is

supposed that at the right innity a spacetime is at in any case. we will see that, depending

on temperature, the found family of exact solutions contains regular spacetimes of all three

possible types - black holes, throats or soliton-like congurations.

ii. general form of static solutions

consider the action

where

i = i0 + ip l,

i0 =

1

2 zm

d2xg[f ()r + v ()()2 + u()]

(1)

(2)

and the polyakov-liouville action [6] incorporating eects of hawking radiation and its back

reaction on the black hole metric can be written as

2

ip l = 



2 zm

d2xg[

()2

2

+ r]

the function  obeys the equation

 = r

(3)

(4)

where  = ,  = n/24 is the quantum coupling parameter, n is number of scalar
massless elds, r is a riemann curvature. we omit the boundary terms in the action as we

are interested only in eld equations and their solutions.

varying the action with respect to a metric gives us (t = 2 i

g ):

t  t (0)

 + t (p l)

 = 0

where

t (0)

2{2(gf  f )  ug + 2v   gv ()2},

t (p l)

(8)

hereafter we assume that a dilaton eld is not constant identically (such special kinds

of solutions are considered in [7], [8]). then, as is shown in [3], [4], we can gain a rich

set of exactly solvable models if the action coecients in (2) f (), v () and u() 
42er 

are restricted by one constraint equation. this equation can be written as

()d

0

v = (u

)

(9)

(in fact, eq.

where u  df
d .
(9) admits further generalization due to a possible term
a(u )2 but, as it leads, generally speaking, to metrics which are not asymptotically at,
hereafter we put a = 0). then it turns out that the metric is a pure static. in the present

paper we will use the conformal gauge

3

ds2 = g(dt2 + d2)

(10)

where g = g(). in this gauge the curvature r = g1(g /g). throughout the paper the
prime denotes dierentiation with respect to a spatial coordinate. substituting it into (4)

we get after simple manipulations

g = ea

(11)

where a is a constant. it is implied that time is normalized in such a way that in (11) the

function g  1 at   .

after simple rearrangement the (00) and (11) eld equations (5) with the metric (11)

are reduced to one equation

1 + 22  1

g 

g

= 0

(12)

where 1 = d f

d , 2 = d2 f

d2  v , f = f  , v = v  

2 ( d

d )2.

in [4] we found that for exactly solvable models (9) the function  is equal to   0()

where

0 = z d

(13)

for a given metric this function is dened up to an arbitrary function  such that  = 0

as it follows from (4). for a static metric (10) this gives us (up to the constant)  = 

where  is a constant. we will see below that for  = 0 we return to black hole solutions

obtained in [4] whereas for  6= 0 we nd new types of static solutions which include, in
particular, nite temperature generalizations of semi-innite throats [2]. in what follows

we will deal with solutions of the form

 = 0 + 

(14)

with an arbitrary  6= 0. at the right innity where spacetime is supposed to be at the
function      for a generic g [5] irrespectively of whether or not  = 0. meanwhile, at
the left coordinate innity    (a reader should bear in mind that if a spacetime is not

4

geodesically complete, the coordinate  does not cover the whole manifold) the admittance

of  6= 0 can qualitatively change the character of solution. for instance, instead of a black
hole for which at a horizon g  0 and  is nite [7] one can get at a left innity a semi-
innite throat [2] for which both g and  diverge there to ensure, by denition of the

semi-innite throat, the divergencies of a proper distance at a nite value of a coordinate

 (see below for details).

the structure of the action coecients in our case is the same as in [4]. namely, the

relationship between them is represented by eq. (9). the new feature introduced in our

treatment as compared to [4] is connected with another character of boundary conditions

for the function . whereas in [7], [4] one deals with a black hole in the hartle-hawking

state for which  = 0 is regular on a horizon, for solutions discussed below  may diverge

at    due to the term  in (14).

it is convenient to split coecients in eq. (12) into two parts singling out the term which

is built up with the help of 0: 1 = (0)

then eq. (12) takes the form

(15)

(16)

where  =  + a. let us multiply this equation by the factor  such that (0)

2  = d((0)

d

.

then eq. (16) can be cast into the form

z + z((0)

+ ) = ( 


2

(17)

(0)

. it follows from (9), (13) and (15) that  = e0. then after

where z = (0)

1  =  d f

d

integration we get from (17)

f (0) = c + de + (1 


2

)

(18)

it follows from the trace of eq. (6), (7) that

5

u =  f =  f (0)

(19)

as for any function f () we have in the metric (11) f = g1f , we get from (19), (11)

and (13) the relationship between constants d2 = 42. in what follows we assume that
the function f as well as f has the asymptotic behavior f  e0 (0 = const) at the right
innity    where   , 0  0 and the metric is at, g  e0  1. this
asymptotic condition is satised, in particular, by cghs [1], rst [9] and bpp models with

0 = 2. thus, we get d = 1,  = 2 (it is assumed for deniteness that 0 < 0) and
the relationship between a dilaton eld and coordinate reads f (0) = f (y)  e2y  by + c
where y  , b =  
4). the value of  can be found from asymptotical conditions
at right innity where spacetime is supposed to be at. let us impose such a condition

(1 + 

which describes quantum elds at nite temperature t . it means that at right innity the

quantum stress-energy tensor should have the form

t (p l)


=

2n

6

t 2(1,1)

(20a)

comparing it with the asymptotic form of eq. (7), we nd that t (p l)

(1,1) where

models under consideration the hawking temperature is equal to t0 = /2 [4] we obtain

2

 = 42 t 2

that 

 = a. then  =   a = 2 + 

. on the other hand, we have from (11) and the condition g  1 at innity
 = 2(t /t0  1) whence b = (1  t 2/t 2
0 )
 is chosen to ensure  = 0 for t = t0 when  = 0 and we return to the

(the sign of 

situation described in [4]). collecting all basic formulas, we obtain

ds2 = g(dt2 + d2), g = exp(0 + 2y), y = , 0 = z d.

(21)

f (0)() = f (y)  e2y  by + c, b = (1  t 2/t 2

0 ), t0 = /2.

if t > t0, the coecient b > 0 and the function takes its minimum at the point y0 = 1

2 ln b

where f (y0) = c  c ,

c  =

(1 + ln

6

(22)

let t = t0, then the coecients  = b = 0 whence we obtain from (21) g = exp(0)( f (0)
c). if we identify c = f (h) we obtain black hole solutions with the horizon at  = h

analyzed in [4]. then the equality of temperatures simply means that the state of the

euclidean metric we deal with is the hartle-hawking one. to make the comparison more
clear, let us pass from the conformal gauge (11) to the schwarzschild one ds2 = gdt2 +
g1dx2used in [4]. this can be achieved by the coordinate transformation x = r dg. it
follows from (21) that x = (2)1 r de f  that agrees with eq. (27) of [4].

it is worth stressing, however, that the class of solutions (21) is much more general than

that found in [4]. it includes not only black holes due to the parameter b which describes

a system at arbitrary temperature when black holes with a regular horizon cannot exist.

in what follows we will use the notation t0 = /2 even in cases when t0 does not have

the meaning of the hawking temperature. equations (21) represent in the closed form the

general expression describing static solutions in exactly solvable models of 2d gravity [3],

[4]. the function in the right hand side of eq. (21) has the universal form while a particular

model is characterized by the choice of f (0)(). it is the analysis of this class of solutions

that we now turn to. as we are mainly interested in nding regular solutions, we discuss

the bpp model and its generalizations.

iii. bpp model at finite temperature

this model is specied by the choice

f = e2  2, f = e2,  = 2, 0 = 2, v = 4e2 + 2

(23)

if t = t0 we have b = 0 and e2y = e2  e2h, g = 1  e2(h). as seen from the above
formulas, the expression for the metric (either in terms of  or in terms of a coordinate) has

the same form as in the classical limit ( = 0), so in this sense the metric does not acquire

quantum corrections [4].

in the paper [2] the authors considered the case t = 0. then

asymptotically the energy density of quantum eld approaches zero (radiationless solutions).

7

in general, spacetime contains a time-like singularity or a singular horizon depending on the

value of c that determines whether or not the function f (y) has a zero. the special case
arises when simultaneously f (y) = 0 = f (y) at y = y0, c = c  =  
reader should have in mind that we dene the quantum parameter  = n/24 whereas in [2]

2 (1 + ln 2

 ) [2] (a

 = n/12). then the spacetime does not contain singularities at all extending from the left
innity where r = 42 (semi-innite throat) to the right one where r = 0.

in fact, the analysis is tractable to the case of an arbitrary t due to the universality

and simplicity of the function f (y) with an arbitrary b. let, rst, t < t0, so b > 0. for

c < c  there is a time-like naked singularity (y = y0) at a nite proper distance. if c > c ,

there exists a singular horizon at  = . the throat exists provided c = c  where c ,
according to (22), depends on temperature via b(t ). the calculation of curvature shows
that at the throat r = 42 independently of temperature. in the limit t = 0 b =  and
we return to radiationless solutions described in [2].

if t > t0, b < 0 the function f (y) is monotonic and does not turn into a zero. then for

any c there is a time-like singularity at  = .

in the point t = t0 the coecients b = 0 = c . if c > 0 we have a black hole in the

hartle-hawking state with a regular horizon. if c < 0 there exists a time-like singularity.

for c = 0 the spacetime is at (linear dilaton vacuum  = y). the situation can be
summarized as follows.

bpp model

t < t0

t = t0, b = 0 = c 

c < c  time-like singularity time-like singularity

t > t0

time-like

c = c  throat

linear dilaton vacuum, at spacetime

singularity

c > c  singular horizon
the main feature of the model in question is the fact that the semi-innite throat may

space-like singularity behind a horizon for any c

exist at any nite temperature t < t0. meanwhile, this needs the special choice c = c (t ).

it turns out, however, that there are another exactly solvable models for which the existence

of a throat is generic and does need ne tuning in constants.

8

iv. generalizations of bpp model

consider the model

f (0) = e2b + e2  2,  > 0, 0 < b  1/2,  = 2, v = 4(e2 + be) + 2,
f (0) = e2b + e2

(24)

which is, according to (9), exactly solvable and the hawking temperature for black hole

solutions is equal to t0 [4]. let rst b > 0 (t < t0). then near the point y0 where f (y0) = 0
we have for any c < c  f  y  y0, f (0)  e2b  0,   , so e2  (y  y0)1/b and,
according to (21), g = e2+2y  (y  y0)1/b. then the curvature r  (y  y0)1/b2. if
b < 1/2, the curvature r = 0 at left innity, the proper distance l between y0 and any other
point y > y0 diverges like l  (y  y0)11/2b. thus, we obtain a soliton-like conguration.

if c = c , f  (y  y0)2, g  (y  y0)2/b, r  (y  y0)2/b2  0, so the conguration is
again soliton-like for any 0 < b < 1. for c > c  spacetime cannot be regular everywhere, it
contains the singular horizon where y  , g  e2y |y|1/b, r  e2y |y|1/b2, a proper
distance l is nite.

the rest of cases can be treated in a similar manner. we only dwell on the fact that for

t = t0 a spacetime represent a black hole whose curvature is nite everywhere. in particular,

at left innity where    the curvature r  0, so spacetime is asymptotically at at
both innities. the variety of cases is tabulated as follows.

f (0) = e2 + e2b, 0 < b < 1/2

t = t0, b = 0 = c 

t > t0

the most interesting feature of this model is the existence of a throat at any temperature

(for c < c , if t  t0 and for an arbitrary c if t > t0).

v. discussion and conclusion

we have found a general form of static solutions in 2d exactly solvable dilaton gravity

theories accounting for quantum eects at nite temperature. the criteria of solvability

are the same as derived in [3], [4] for eternal black holes and represent one constraint on

the action coecient (9). thus, every model with black hole solutions considered in [4]

generates a family of solutions of another kind which generalize [4] and reduce to it in the

particular case t = t0 when the solution describes a black hole with a hawking temperature

t0 in thermal equilibrium with its hawking radiation. it was indicated in [4] that exactly

solvable models in question exhibits a series of universal properties.

in particular, it is

remarkable that a hawking temperature is constant for all such models, t0 = /2. the

present consideration extended this universality to a much more wide class solution and

enabled us to classied them in an unied manner due to the universal structure of (21)

independently of the choice of the model. in fact, the particular properties of the model

are encoded in the only function f (0)(). if f (0)() does not have zeros at nite , as it

takes place for the bpp model [2] and its generalization considered in the present paper,
the only relevant information is contained in the asymptotic behavior of f (0) at   .
we analyzed two concrete examples and found that there exist three types of solutions

regular everywhere. first, it is a black hole, if t = t0 (the possibility of solutions of

such a kind was pointed out in [4]). second, this a semi-innite throat generalizing the

observation made in [2]. the most interesting feature of throats found in the model (24)

10

with b = 1/2 is that such types of solutions, unlike the bpp case, do not need a special

choice of parameters of the solution: semi-innite throats may exist in the whole range of

parameters and temperatures. third case is a soliton-like conguration extending in both

directions to at innities without horizons. such a type of solution is absent in the bpp

model but may occur in the generalizations of it.

the conditions which make the existence of semi-innite throats possible are essentially

quantum. indeed, as seen from (21), such a kind of conguration arises only if the function

f (y) is not monotonic due to the coecient b and takes its minimum value at some nite

y0 = 1
2 ln b. however, in the classical limit   0 the coecient b  0 and we get
g = e0(f (0)  c). choosing c = f (h) we can get a classical counterpart of a quantum
black hole but not a semi-innite throat. for example, with  = 2, f (0) = e2 we have
the familiar expression for a static dilaton black hole g = 1  ce2 where c/2 plays the role
of a classical adm mass.

in the present paper we determined possible types of static solutions but did not consider

dynamical scenarios in the process of which they could arise. here we only restrict ourselves

by a remark that nite temperature solutions allow us to consider more complicated pro-

cesses of interaction between a black hole and its quantum surrounding than a evaporation

into vacuum. in particular, this enables us to include into consideration directly the role of

thermal bath [10]. another interested problem for further researches is looking for possibil-

ities to gain new exactly solvable models not only due to relaxing the regularity condition

for the function  at the left innity (as was made in the present paper) but also to the

generalization of the action structure itself. all this needs a special treatment.
