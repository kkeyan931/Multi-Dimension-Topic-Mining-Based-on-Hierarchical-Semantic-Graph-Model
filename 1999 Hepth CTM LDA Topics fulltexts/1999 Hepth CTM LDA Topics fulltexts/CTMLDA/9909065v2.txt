abstract

we study the hi, hi, hi correlators in the 2d ising model
perturbed by a magnetic eld. we compare the results of a set of
high precision montecarlo simulations with the predictions of two dif-
ferent approximations: the form factor approach, based on the exact
s-matrix description of the model, and a short distance perturbative
expansion around the conformal point. both methods give very good
results, the rst one performs better for distances larger than the
correlation length, while the second one is more precise for distances
smaller than the correlation length. in order to improve this agree-
ment we extend the perturbative analysis to the second order in the
derivatives of the ope constants.

1 introduction

in these last years much progress has been done in the study of two di-
mensional statistical systems in the neighbourhood of critical points. in the
framework of quantum eld theory these systems can be seen as conformal
field theories (cfts) perturbed by some relevant operator. since the sem-
inal work of belavin, polyakov and zamolodchikov [1] we have an almost
complete understanding of cfts (at least for the minimal models): we have
complete lists of all the operators of the theories and explicit expressions for
the correlators. however much less is known on their relevant perturbations.
in some cases it has been possible to show that these perturbations give rise
in these cases again we have a rather precise
to integrable models [2, 3].
description of the theory.
in particular it is possible to obtain the exact
asymptotic expression for the large distance behaviour of the correlators [4].
from this information several important results (and in particular all the
universal amplitude ratios) can be obtained.

however in comparing with numerical simulations or with experiments
one is often interested in the short distance behaviour of the correlators
(short here means for distances smaller or equal than the correlation length)
and this is not easily accessible in integrable systems. moreover integrable
perturbations represent only a small subset of the possible theories. for
instance in the case of the ising model both the purely thermal and the
purely magnetic perturbations are integrable, but for any combination of
them the exact integrability is lost.

for these reasons, besides the s-matrix results, it is important to develop
a perturbative approach well dened in the short distance regime of the the-
ory and such that it does not rely on the exact integrability of the model.
this is however a rather dicult task. in fact any naive perturbative expan-
sion of the (massless) cft along a relevant direction, is aected by infrared
divergences (ir) and some non-trivial strategy is needed.

recently, in [5, 6], a new approach has been proposed to overcome this
diculty (see [7]-[15] for relevant related works and preexisting ideas). the
method is based on wilsons operator product expansion (ope). roughly
speaking the main idea of this new approach is that the wilsons coecients
of the ope, being well dened at short distance, can be assumed to have a
regular, ir safe, perturbative expansion with respect to the coupling. for
this reason we shall refer to it in the following as the irs (infrared safe)

1

perturbative approach.

the main requirement of this irs approach is the the knowledge of the
wilson coecients (and their derivatives with respect to the perturbing cou-
pling). for this reason it is particularly ecient if applied to perturbations
of exactly solved theories like 2d critical cfts (but the framework is quite
general and in principle could be extended also to higher dimensions).

the price one has to pay to control in this way the ir divergences is
that one needs, as an external input information, the expectation values
of the operators involved in the expansion. there are at this point two
possibilities. the rst one is to concentrate only on observables in which
these expectation values exactly cancel. this is a small but very interesting
subset of the informations that we can obtain with the irs perturbation.

the second possibility is to obtain the desired expectation values with
some other method or extract them from numerical simulations (an inter-
esting numerical approach to obtain these vev is based on the truncated
conformal space technique, see [16, 17] and references therein).

from this point of view, the irs approach becomes particularly pow-
erful if applied to integrable perturbations, since in this case some of the
expectation values can be deduced from the s-matrix of the model.

the last step one has to face in comparing the results of the irs method
with simulations or experiments is the presence of a nonuniversal normaliza-
tion factor between the operators in the continuum quantum eld theory and
their lattice discretizations. these normalizations (and the related normal-
ization of the coupling of the perturbation) can be xed if an exact solution
of the lattice model exists at the critical point. actually much less is needed.
one only needs the exact expression (or even only its large distance asymp-
totic form) of a correlator involving the operators in which we are interested.
this makes the ising model perturbed by a magnetic eld a perfect candi-
date for testing the irs method. in fact it is well known that this model
is exactly integrable [2, 3] and all the amplitude ratios and expectation val-
ues of the primary elds are known. moreover the ising model is exactly
solvable at the critical point and the exact expression is known for several
correlators [18, 19].

in fact the irs approach was successfully tested with the magnetic per-
turbation of the ising model in [6]. the aim of this paper is to make a further
step in this direction. in particular we have three goals:

2

a] compare the results of the method with new high precision montecarlo

simulations so as to test the range of applicability of the method.

b] compare the irs method with the results obtained in the s-matrix frame-

work with the so called form factor (ff) approach.

c] show that it is possible to extend the analysis of [5, 6] to higher orders in
the perturbative coupling and discuss the technical problems that one
has to aord following this route.

in particular we shall study in this paper, as an example, the second order
term in the perturbative expansion of the hi correlator. the reason for this
choice is that this correlator has a very peculiar behaviour since its rst order
correction turns out to be exactly zero, thus our second order calculation is
mandatory if one is interested to study the inuence of the magnetic eld on
the simple critical behaviour of the correlator.

this paper is organized as follows. sect. 2 is devoted to a general de-
scription of the ising model in a magnetic eld both on the lattice and in the
continuum. the aim of this section is to x conventions and normalizations
which will be useful in the following. in sect. 3 we shall briey describe the
irs method, while in sect. 4 we shall extend it to second order derivatives of
the magnetic eld. in sect. 5 we shall briey describe our montecarlo simu-
lation while in sect. 6 we shall compare the results of our simulations with
irs and ff predictions. finally sect. 7 will be devoted to some concluding
remarks. the details of the calculation of the second order derivative of the
wilson coecient are collected in the appendix. we have reported in three
tables at the end of the paper a sample of the results of our simulations.

2 ising model in a magnetic eld.

the continuum theory, which is the starting point of the irs expansion is
given by the action:

a = a0 + hz d2x (x)

(1)

where a0 is the action of the conformal eld theory which describes the
ising model at the critical point. let us start our analysis by looking in detail
at this cft.

3

2.1 the ising model at the critical point

the ising model at the critical point is described by the unitary minimal
cft with central charge c = 1/2. it contains three conformal families whose
primary elds 1, ,  have scaling dimensions x = 0, 1/8, 1 respectively. the
fusion rule algebra is

= [1]
[][]
[][] = []
[][] = [1] + [].

(2)

once the operator content is known, the only remaining information
which is needed to completely identify the theory are the ope constants.
the ope algebra is dened as

i(r)j(0) =x{k}

c{k}ij (r){k}(0)

(3)

where with the notation {k} we mean that the sum runs over all the elds
of the conformal family [k]. the structure functions c k
ij(r) are c-number
functions of r which must be single valued in order to take into account
locality. in the large r limit they decay with a power like behaviour

whose amplitude is given by

ij(r)  |r|dim(c k
c k

ij )

c k
ij  lim
r

ij(r) |r|dim(c k
ij ).
c k

(4)

(5)

the actual value of these constants depends on the normalization of the
elds, which can be chosen by xing the long distance behaviour of, for
instance, the  and  correlators. in this paper we follow the commonly
adopted convention which is1:

h(x)(0)i =

h(x)(0)i =

|x|  

|x|  .

paper corresponds to 2 times that of ref. [6].

elds

2.2 the ising model in a magnetic eld

if we switch on the magnetic eld h, the structure functions acquire a h
dependence so that we have in general

i(r)j(0) =x{k}

c{k}ij (h, r){k}(0)

.

(11)

also the mean values of the  and  operators acquire a dependence on
h. standard renormalization group arguments allow one to relate this h
dependence to the scaling dimensions of the operators of the theory and lead
to the following expressions:

hih = ah
hih = ah

the exact value of the two constants a and a can be found in [20] and [21]
respectively

(16)

notice however that these amplitudes are not universal. they depend on the
details of the regularization scheme. thus some further work is needed to
obtain their value on the lattice.

2.3 the lattice model

the lattice version of the above model is dened by the following partition
function:

z = xi=1

e(phi,ji ij +hpi

i)

(17)

where the notation hi, ji denotes nearest neighbour sites in the lattice which
we assume to be a two dimensional square lattice of size l. in order to select
only the magnetic perturbation,  must be xed to its critical value:

 = c =

1
2

log (2 + 1) = 0.4406868...

nally by dening hl = ch we nd

z = xi=1

ecphi,ji ij +hlpi

i

(18)

in the following we shall denote the lattice discretization of the operators ,
 with the index l. the magnetization m(h) is dened as usual:

m(h) 

1
n


hl

(log z)|=c = h

1

n xi

ii.

(19)

where n  l2 denotes the number of sites of the lattice. this result suggests
the following denition for the lattice discretization of 

l 

1

n xi

i

,

so that the mean value of l coincides with m(h):

hli  m(h)
similarly, we dene the internal energy as:

e(h) 

1
2n


hl

(log z)|=c = h

2n xhi,ji

iji

(20)

(21)

(22)

for the energy operator one must also take into account the presence of an
additional bulk contribution at the critical point. this constant can be easily
evaluated (for instance by using kramer-wannier duality) to be 0 = 12 .
this result suggests, for the lattice discretization of , the following denition

so that the mean value of l coincides with the singular part of e(h):

 are dierent from the corresponding

in order to relate the lattice results with the continuum ones, we must
2.
x the relative normalizations of  versus l ,  versus l and h versus hl
the simplest way to do this is to look at the analogous of eq.(6,7) at the
critical point (namely for hl = 0) [22]. from the exact solution of the ising
model [18] we know that

hijih=0 =

r2

|rij|1/4

(27)

where rij denotes the distance on the lattice between the sites i and j and
we know from [19] that:

r2

 = e3(1)25/24 = 0.70338...

by comparing this result with eq.(6) we nd

l = r = 0.83868...

(28)

(29)

2this essentially amounts to measure all the quantities in units of the lattice spacing.

for this reason we can x in the following the lattice spacing to 1 and neglect it.

7

from this we can also obtain the normalization of the lattice magnetic
eld which must exactly compensate that of the spin operator in the pertur-
bation term h. we nd:

hl = (r)1h = 1.1923...h

(30)

combining these two results we obtain the value in lattice units of the

constant a

al

 = (r)16/15a = 1.058...

(31)

in the case of the energy operator the connected correlator on the lattice, at
hl = 0 and for any value of , has the following expression [23]:

hl(0)l(r)ic =  

!2hk 2

1 (r)  k 2

0 (r)i

(32)

where k0 and k1 are modied bessel functions,  is a parameter related to
the reduced temperature, dened as

 = 4|  c|

(33)

and with the index c we denote the connected correlator (notice that thanks
to the denition (23) no disconnected part must be subtracted at the critical
point and the index c becomes redundant). this expression has a nite value
in the   0 limit (namely at the critical point). in fact the bessel functions
dierence can be expanded in the small argument limit as

hk 2
1 (r)  k 2

0 (r)i =

1
(r)2 + ...

thus giving, exactly at the critical point:

hl(0)l(r)i =

1

(r)2 

r2


|r|2 .

hence r = 1/. by comparing this result with eq.(7) we nd

l = r =




and from this we obtain the expression in lattice units of a

al

 = (r)8/15(r)a = 0.58051...

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

8

2.4 correlators

in the remaining part of this paper we shall be mainly interested in the
dependence on the external magnetic eld of the following correlators:

g,  h(0)(r)i
g,  h(0)(r)i
g,  kh(0)(r)i

(38)

(39)

(40)
where k  sign(h). we already know the behaviour at the critical point of
the rst two of them, which is given by eq. (6), (7) in the continuum (or
equivalently eq.(27), (35) on the lattice), while the ope constants reported
in eq.(8) immediately tell us that h(0)(r)i = 0.
for small values of h we may expect to add to these results correction
terms functions of h and r. however standard renormalization group argu-
ments show that these two variables are actually related and that there is a
natural scaling variable which describes the short distance expansion of these
correlators in a magnetic eld which is t  |h| |r|15/8. in order to obtain an
explicit expansion in powers of t we must absorb the scaling dimensions of
the various operators in the expansion 3. to this end let us dene

f,  h(0)(r)i|r|1/4
f,  h(0)(r)i|r|2
f,  kh(0)(r)i|r|9/8

(41)

(42)

(43)

where k  sign(h).
the powers which appear in the t expansion of the functions f can be
immediately deduced from the analysis of the ope via the irs method, that
will be described in the following section.

3 on the contrary, in the large distance regime where one may use the predictions
obtained with the form factor approach, the natural normalization is that of the g,
functions dened above.

9

3 the infrared safe approach

the goal of the method presented in ref. [5] is to obtain informations about
the short distance behavior of a conformal eld theory perturbed by relevant
operators.

the general idea behind this approach, (for preexisting ideas see

[9,
10, 11, 12, 13]) is the fact that wilson coecients, being short distance
objects, can be taken to have a regular, ir safe, perturbative expansion with
respect to the coupling. this ope approach leaves unxed some constants
that parameterize the vacuum expectation values of operators that appear
in conformal eld theory.

in [5] it was found that the correlators of the perturbed cft are given
in terms of the derivatives of the wilson coecients (calculated at h = 0
point). to be precise, they appear in the following way

hi(r)j(0)ih =x{k}

c{k}ij (h, r)h{k}(0)ih =

x{k}(cid:20)c{k}ij (0, r) + hc{k}ij (0, r) h +

hc{k}ij (0, r) h2 +   (cid:21) h{k}(0)ih.
it was also shown that a general formula could be written for the n  th
derivative of the wilson coecients with respect to h. here we will write
only the rst and the second order derivatives for the wilson coecients,

the general structure of this formula is a sum of the naive perturbative
term plus n (for the n  th order coecient) infrared counterterms. the
asterisk reminds that the sum on the counterterms is truncated and is per-
formed up to a given infrared dimension (see again [5]).

the construction of the irs expansion requires two steps.
 first, one must select by using the ope rules which operators can ap-
pear in the various expansions, identify their scaling dimensions, select
the dominant ones and give their expression in terms of the structure
constants and of their derivatives.

 second, one must evaluate the derivatives of the structure constants by
using eq.(44) or (45) to reduce them to suitable integrals over correla-
tors evaluated at the critical point. this allows in principle to complete
the analysis, since the explicit form of all possible critical correlators is
known. however in general these integrals are highly non trivial and
their evaluation represents the major problem of the whole approach.

these two steps where performed in [6] for all the terms in the expansion
involving at most rst order derivatives of the structure constants. this
allows to obtain the rst three terms in the expansion of the hi and hi
correlators (which are reported for completeness at the end of this section).
on the contrary for the hi in this way one can only obtain the rst two
terms of the expansion. moreover one can verify by an explicit calculation
that the second of them is identically zero ([5]). thus in the hi correlator,
in order to reach the rst non trivial correction to scaling, it is mandatory
to extend the analysis of [6] and to deal with second order derivatives of
the wilson coecients. we shall address this problem in the next section.
in particular, in sect. 4.1 we shall discuss the rst step of the irs analysis,
and select among the possible candidates the one with the lowest power of
t which, as anticipated, turns out to involve a second order derivative of a
structure constant. then in sect. 4.2 (and in the appendix) we shall explicitly
evaluate this contribution. let us conclude this section by listing for all the
three correlators the rst three terms of the irs expansion

and in the appendix.

4 second order corrections

12

4.1 dimensional analysis

to estimate the higher order corrections to hi we must analyse two kinds
of possible contributions.

 the expectation values of secondary operators multiplied by the wilson

coecients and their rst derivatives.

 the second derivatives of wilson coecients.

we would like to understand which is the most important of these terms.
in the ising model there are two secondary operators at rst level, obtained
by acting on  and  with the virasoro generator l1 and its hermitian
conjugate (the action of l1 on 1 gives 0). we start by considering

1  l1 l1

(49)

and

(50)
where lk, lk are virasoro generators. it is clear that the expectation value
of this kind of operators is zero being total derivatives. so let us go to second
level of the algebra. there are two possible terms:

1  l1 l1

l2
1

l2
1,

l2 l2

(51)

where  is a generic primary eld. in this situation we have to consider also
the identity operator.

in the identity sector the only contribution is given by

t t = l2 l2 1

(52)

i.e. the energy-momentum tensor. again a simple dimensional analysis shows
that

dim t t = 4,

ht tih = at t|h|32/15

giving

it is clear that the terms containing secondary operators (of second level) of
 and  are of higher order in t and will not be considered here.

the explicit calculation of this integral can be done using a technique
developed by mathur, [24]. the general idea behind this approach is to
factorize the integral in a holomorphic and antiholomorphic part using stokes
theorem. the calculation is reported in the appendix. after this calculation,
in order to get rid of the infrared cuto we perform a mellin transform of the
integral and the infrared counterterm (see [6] for more details). in this we
we end up with a nite result when the infrared cuto goes to innity. the
nal result is

let us stress that the techniques that we have discussed in this section
can be extended to any order in the derivatives of the wilson coecients.
this is a rather important observation, since it allows, in principle, to study
the irs corrections, in a consistent way, to any given order in t.

it has been recently shown [25] that in the case of the 2d ising model in a
magnetic eld, algorithms based on the exact (or approximate) diagonaliza-
tion of the transfer matrix are much more eective than standard montecarlo

15

simulations. in particular this is true for all possible observables involved in
the large distance behaviour of the model. the only exception is represented
by the short distance behaviour of the point-point correlators which is the
subject of the present paper. in fact in order to reach lattices as large as
possible in the transfer-matrix programs discussed in [25] only zero momen-
tum projected observables could be studied, while we are instead interested
in point-point correlators. moreover, we need to have a window as large as
possible between the region (few lattice spacings) dominated by the lattice
artifacts and the correlation length. this windows shrinks to zero in the
transfer matrix approach where only small values of the correlation length
can be studied.

for these reasons we decided to perform our tests with standard monte-
carlo simulations. we used a swendsen-wang type algorithm, modied so
as to take into account the presence of an external magnetic eld. for a
detailed description of the algorithm see for instance [26, 27].

5.1 finite size eects.
as a preliminary test we performed a simulation at hl = 4.4069104 (which
corresponds to h = 0.001) with lattice size l = 128 which exactly coincides
with one of the simulations reported in [26] and found results in complete
agreement with those quoted in [26]. then for the same value of hl we
performed a set of high precision simulations varying the lattice size so as to
check the presence of possible nite size eects. in particular we compared
our estimates of the mean magnetization, susceptibility and internal energy
with the known exact results, extrapolated at the value of hl at which we
performed the simulations 4.

the comparison is reported in tab.1.

it turns out that lattice sizes at

4if one is interested in a high precision comparison, also the contribution of secondary
elds should be taken into account in extracting these exact estimates. the amplitude of
some of these secondary elds have been evaluated numerically in [25]. in the case of m
and , for the values of hl in which we are interested, the contributions of the secondary
elds are strictly smaller than the statistical errors of the results of our simulations and
hence can be neglected in the comparison. on the contrary for the internal energy it turns
out that the amplitude of the rst correction is rather large (see [25] for details) and must
be taken into account. in fact, if we would neglect it, instead of the value reported in
tab.1 we would nd e = 0.71652 in clear disagreement with the montecarlo results. this
represents a non trivial test of the results of [25].

the lattice sizes used in the simulations, in the remaining three columns the
mean values of the magnetization, susceptibility and internal energy. in the

the amplitudes for these quantities.

least larger than 12 times the correlation length are needed to be sure that
nite size eects are under control (with this we mean that the systematic
errors induced by the nite size of the lattice are smaller than the statistical
errors of the simulations and can be neglected). a side consequence of this
observation is that the simulations reported in [26] are indeed aected by
rather large nite size eects.

it is interesting to notice that the magnetic observables are more aected
by nite size eects than the thermal one. as one can easily expect the
largest corrections appear in the case of the susceptibility.

5.2 the simulation

once we were sure to have nite size eects under control we performed a
set of high precision simulations of the model for three dierent values of the
magnetic eld.

an important quantity to understand the range of validity of the irs
approximation is the correlation length. roughly speaking we expect that
the irs results should give a reasonable approximation for distances equal or
smaller than the correlation length, while above it the form factor approach
should give results of better quality. for this reason it is important to have
a good estimate of . this can be easily obtained from the knowledge of the
spectrum of the theory. we nd, in lattice units:

for all the values of hl that we simulated, we studied the three cor-
relators: h(0)(r)i, h(0)(r)i and h(0)(r)i, for r = 1,   , lmax, where
the maximum distance lmax was chosen to be roughly twice the correlation
length. in this way we can test our results also in the large distance regime,
where predictions from the form factor approach are expected to give very
precise estimates for the correlators. notice that when studying the large dis-
tance behaviour of correlators one is usually interested in the zero momentum
projection of the connected part of the correlator. on the contrary in the
present case we are interested in the pointpoint correlators without mean
value subtraction or zero momentum projections. this must be taken into
account when comparing the data with those obtained with the form factor
approach. some informations on the simulations are reported in tab.3.

distance at which the correlators have been evaluated, its value almost co-
incides with twice the correlation length. l denotes the lattice size, hl the

separates two measures.

we report an example of our results (for the value hl = 4.4069 104) in
the rst columns of tabs. 7, 8 and 9. the quoted errors have been obtained
with a standard jacknife method.

6 discussion of the results

in g.s 1-8 and tab.7, 8 and 9 we compare our estimates for the correlators
with the irs and form factor predictions. for completeness we briey recall
here the form factor results (see [28, 29] for details) and give the numerical
values (once all the conversion factors are taken into account) of the constants
in the irs approach.

6.1 form factor results

the scattering theory which describes the scaling limit of the ising model in
a magnetic eld [3] contains eight dierent species of self-conjugated particles
aa, a = 1, . . . , 8 with masses

= (1.6180339887..) m1 ,

= (1.9890437907..) m1 ,

m2 = 2m1 cos

m3 = 2m1 cos

m4 = 2m2 cos

m5 = 2m2 cos

in lattice units is

.

(67)

from the knowledge of the masses and of the form factors it is possible
to obtain a large distance approximation for the correlators by constructing

19

a spectral sum over a complete set of intermediate states. we thus nd for
any pair of local operators 1 and 2:

where the form factors f 
operator (x) on the asymptotic states aa, i.e they are dened as

a1...an(1, . . . , n) are the matrix elements of the local

f 
a1...an(1, . . . , n) = h0|(0)|aa1(1) . . . aan(n)i .

(69)

the important point is that these form factors can be exactly computed

in the integrable models once the smatrix is known.

it is natural to organize the above expansion setting a reference value mr
and keeping in the spectral sum only the states with a mass smaller than
mr. looking at eq.(68) we see that we must expect, as a consequence of this
truncation, a systematic error in the approximation of the order o (emrx).
up to mr = 2m1 (where m1 is the fundamental mass of the model) only
single particle states survive in the sum and eq.(68) greatly simplies.
in
particular looking at eq.(66) we see that only the rst three states (which are
the only ones below the pair production threshold) survive. eq.(68) becomes
in this case, (choosing for instance the spin-spin correlator)

g(r)  m 2(hl)(1 +

i |2
|f 


3xi=1

k0(mir))

(70)

where k0(x) is the modied bessel function and f 
i denotes the overlap
(measured in units of the magnetization) of the ith state with the  operator.
m(hl) denotes the magnetization and its hl dependence is given in (12, 31).

similarly the spin-energy and energy-energy correlators are given by

3xi=1

the constants f 

i and f 

i have been evaluated in [28, 29]. their value is

reported in tab.4 and 5.

one can systematically improve the approximation by setting higher val-
ues of mr. for instance, for mr = 3 one must keep into account the rst ve
single particle form factors together with the two-particle ones involving the
(1,1), (1,2) and (1,3) pairs, and so on. by using the results of [28, 29] also
these multiparticle form factors can be evaluated exactly.

as discussed above, in eq.s (70), (71) and (72) we expect systematic errors
of the order o (e2m1r). for distances larger than the correlation length these
deviations are very small but become increasingly relevant as the correlation
length is approached.
it would be important to have an estimate of the
magnitude of these corrections. from this point of view the present case is a
perfect laboratory since we know that all other possible sources of systematic

21

errors are under control. we report an example of the results obtained using
eq.s (70), (71) and (72) (for the value hl = 4.4069 104) in the last column
of tabs. 7, 8 and 9. in order to gain further insight on the convergence of
the approximation we have also evaluated the contribution of the rst eight
terms of the spectral series (i.e. with mr = 3m1). we report in g.10 the
result of this analysis, together with those with mr = 2m1 and mr = m1 for
comparison, in the particular case of the  correlator.

6.2

irs approach

by using the results of sect. 3 and 4 and the exact knowledge of the constants
r and r one can easily write the constants bi
 in lattice units. they are
reported in tab.65.

we report an example of our results (obtained by plugging the values of
tab.6 in eqs.(46), (47) and (48) in the particular case hl = 4.4069 104), in
the second column of tabs. 7, 8 and 9 .

6.3 comparison with mc results

5in doing this conversion one must also take into account the h factor contained in t.
to stress this fact we introduce in analogy to hl a new scaling variable tl  |hl| |r|15/8. in
the coecients reported in tab.6 the conversion from t to tl has already been taken into
account, hence they refer to the irs expansion in powers of tl of the correlators

22

6.3.1 lattice artifacts

it is interesting to see that lattice artifacts are conned to a remarkably small
region of few lattice spacings, which shows a negligible dependence on the
magnetic eld or on the type of correlator. since the lattice artifacts decrease
so quickly it is rather easy to nd where does the region of applicability of
the irs results starts, by simply looking at the distance lmin where for the
rst time the irs prediction becomes compatible (within the errors) with the
mc data or, if this never happens, looking at the location of the minimum
dierence between irs predictions and the mc simulations 6. it turns out
that for all correlators and hl values lmin ranges between 7 and 9 lattice
spacings. this tells us that, at least in the case of the ising model perturbed
by a magnetic eld, the irs method has a large window of applicability,
which becomes larger and larger as the critical point is approached. this is
well exemplied by g.6 and 7 where the dierence between mc data and
irs predictions is plotted, for the  correlator in the short range region,
rst in units of the lattice spacing and then in units of the correlation length.
it would be interesting to test if this behaviour also holds for other models
or for dierent realizations of this one.

6.3.2 hl dependence

in the range lmin < r <  the agreement between irs predictions and
mc results is always very good.
in particular, it seems that the method
reaches its better results in the case of  correlator. as expected, the irs
approximation becomes better and better as we approach the critical point
(see g.s 3, 4 and 5). first because the range of validity becomes larger
and second because the systematic deviations due to the terms neglected in
the expansion, which are proportional to higher powers of hl become less
important. in particular for the  correlator at hl = 1.1017  104 there
is a wide range (more than 40 lattice spacings) in which the irs prediction
coincides with the mc results within the errors (see g.8).

6we may expect that higher orders in the t expansion improve the large distance
behaviour of the irs results, but they give a negligible contribution around lmin where
the discrepancy between montecarlo data and irs predictions is completely dominated by
lattice artifacts.

23

6.3.3 irs versus ff.

looking at tables 7, 8, 9 and at the g.s 1-5 we see that, as expected, the
ff approach performs better than the irs one for distances larger than the
correlation length and that the opposite is true for distances smaller than .
it is interesting to see that for distances of the order of the correlation length
the irs and ff methods give comparable performances. some interesting
informations on the systematic errors involved in the two approximations can
be extracted from the data.

1] while the systematic errors in the irs approach have a polynomial be-
haviour in the distance r (which is contained in tl), those of the ff
approach have an exponential behaviour. this is clearly visible in g.2
where the deviations are plotted as a function of r for the correlator
g at hl = 4.4069  104 and in g.3-5 where they are plotted for all
the correlators and all the values of hl as functions of r/. this makes
the irs method still reasonably reliable even for distances twice the
correlation length.

2] we may obtain a rough estimate of the magnitude of the systematic er-
rors involved in the irs approach with the following argument. since
tl  |hl| |r|15/8, looking at eq.(65) we see that for distances of the
order of the correlation length we have tl  0.06. depending on
the correlator chosen, we would expect deviations of the order o(t2
l ),
o(t31/15
 constants are of order
unity, this amounts to an expected deviation for the f functions of
order f  0.004. this expectation is in good agreement with the
values of f obtained by comparing the mc and irs estimates at the
distance r = . (see for instance the data reported in tab.s 7,8 and
9. in using these data one must take into account the normalization
between f, and g, functions).

). since in general the bi

l

), o(t32/15

l

3] a similar analysis can be performed in the case of the ff method. in
this case we know that the systematic errors are of order o(emrr).
we shall further discuss them in sect.6.3.5 below. in the large distance
regime r  1.5  the performances of the ff approach are very good.
for instance, in this region, for the lowest value of h that we studied:

24

hl = 1.1017  104 the ff predictions for the  correlator coincide
with the mc results within the errors (see g.5).

6.3.4 convergence of the irs expansion

it is interesting to study the convergence properties of the irs method, i.e.
to see if the agreement with the montecarlo data improves as higher terms
are added in the expansion.





hi and hi.

in these two cases the agreement improves as new terms are added in
the expansion. this is clearly visible in g.8 where we have plotted
the dierence between the mc data for the correlator hi at hl =
1.1017  104 and the irs results with one (pluses), two (crosses) and
three (diamonds) terms in the expansion. the analogous plot for the
hi correlator shows exactly the same behaviour.

hi.

in this case we nd exactly the opposite behaviour. as it is shown
in g.9 the new coecient that we evaluated does not improve the
agreement with the montecarlo data which is, by the way, impressively
good already with the simple zero order contribution to the correlator.
we see two possible reasons for this, rather unexpected, behaviour.

1] as noticed in sect.4, the next term in the perturbative expansion of
the correlator has an exponent 32/15, which is very near to the one
that we evaluated. we cannot evaluate this further contribution
since it would require the knowledge of the expectation value of
the t t operator.
in principle this term could well compensate
the deviation that we observe.

2] this behaviour could be an indication of the bad convergence prop-
if this is the case it would be very
erties of the irs method.
interesting to test (in view of the good behaviour of the other two
correlators) if this is a peculiar feature of the hi correlator or a
feature of the expansion itself. this issue could be settled in prin-
ciple by looking to the higher perturbative terms in the expansions
of the two other correlators. we plan to address this point in a
forthcoming paper.

25

6.3.5 convergence of the ff expansion

in order to study the convergence of the ff approximation we have compared
the montecarlo data in the case of the hi correlator at hl = 1.1017  104
with the result of the ff approximation truncated at mr = m1, mr = 2m1,
mr = 3m1 respectively. this corresponds to take into account one, three and
eight states respectively in the spectral sum. the results of the comparison
are reported in g.10 . looking at this gure one may see that as higher
orders are added the approximation smoothly converges to the mc data.
by comparing the three approximations one may get a perception of the
convergence rate of the method.

7 concluding remarks

in this paper we have compared the predictions of the irs and ff approx-
imations for the ,  and  correlators with the results of a set of high
precision mc simulations of the 2d ising model perturbed by a magnetic eld.
to this end we have extended the irs approach to second order derivatives
of the structure constants. our main results are:

 lattice artifacts are conned in a small region of few lattice spacings.
 there is a wide region ranging from  7  9 lattice spacings to the
correlation length in which the mc data are in good agreement with
the irs results.

 the agreement improves as the critical point is approached.
 for distances smaller than  the irs gives a better approximation than
the ff method, while the opposite is true for distances larger than .

the irs method can be extended in principle to any order in the deriva-
tives of the wilson coecients, by using the integration method of [24] and
the technique of the mellin transform. however in the case that we studied,
i.e. the hi correlator, the irs method turns out to show rather bad con-
vergence properties. it remains an open problem to understand if this is a
limit of the method itself or if it is a peculiar feature of the correlator that
we have chosen.

26

it would be very interesting to extend this analysis to other models in
this same universality class. in particular one could study the model recently
introduced in [30, 31] for which an exact bethe ansatz solution, out of the
critical point exists. another interesting application of the method would be
the study of the correlators in the case of the most general perturbation of the
ising critical point (i.e. a mixed situation with both magnetic and thermal
perturbations). in this case the exact integrability is lost but the irs method
is still valid and could give important informations on the behaviour of the
correlators. in particular it would allow us to compare our approximation
with the interesting results, directly obtained on the lattice, in [32].

now we are able to evaluate both the z-plane and w-plane integrations

of (73) using the previous lemma.
first, to perform the z-plane integration, we pose
