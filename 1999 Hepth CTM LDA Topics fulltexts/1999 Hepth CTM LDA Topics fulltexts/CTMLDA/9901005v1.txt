abstract: a brief review of some aspects of heterotic (0, 2) compactications in the
framework of exactly solvable superconformal eld theories and gauged linear sigma mod-
els is presented.

1

introduction

the general class of four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric heterotic compactications
has (0, 2) supersymmetry on the world sheet. geometrically, such models are dened by
a stable holomorphic vector bundle (coherent sheaf) over a calabi-yau threefold subject
to further anomaly cancellation conditions involving the rst and second chern classes of
the vector and the tangent bundle. it has long been an open question whether generically
such models are indeed consistent vacua of the heterotic string. it has been argued in [1]
that (0, 2) models realizable as linear sigma models [2] provide a set of exact perturbative
vacua. in [3] we presented a class of exactly solvable superconformal eld theories with
(0, 2) supersymmetry, which were argued to describe special points in the moduli space
of (0, 2) linear sigma models. as a byproduct we got to know a subset of (0, 2) models
inheriting their dening data from (2, 2) models and automatically satisfying all the linear
and quadratic anomaly constraints. as a rst step towards establishing mirror symmetry
in the (0, 2) context we dened a way to obtain mirror symmetric pairs at least in the
afore mentioned subclass of models [4]. another approach was made in [5] by successive
orbifolding in the landau-ginzburg phase.
on is familiar with mirror symmetry, but there exist more general perturbative target
space dualities for (0, 2) models. two at large radius completely dierent looking models
can have the same landau-ginzburg phase. in [5] it was shown that also at large radius
the total dimension of the moduli spaces agrees providing evidence for the conjecture
that the models are isomorphic throughout the entire moduli space with a non-trivial
map among complex, kahler and bundle moduli.
other important approaches to describe (0, 2) models using f-theory and equivariant
sheaves are not covered here.

2 exactly solvable scfts and distler-kachru models

gepner provided exactly solvable conformal eld theories (cft) describing special point
in the moduli space of a calabi-yau (2, 2) compactication.
in this case, up to the
application of the bosonic string map the modular invariant partition function is left-right
symmetric. in order to nd a cft description of more general (0, 2) compactications

one needs a method for constructing really heterotic partition functions. one way to
achieve this is by using simple currents. since two simple currents can be non-local to
each other, the partition function obtained after modding out these simple currents need
not to be left-right symmetric. as a generalisation of gepner models we proposed the
following cfts

where the simple currents are chosen in such a way as to guarantee two right moving
world sheet supersymmetries, one space time supersymmetry and an extension of the
gauge group from so(16  2r)  u(1)r3 to e9r. if the simple current l does contain
factors of both ns and r type, then the left moving supersymmetry is broken and one
obtains a model with gauge group e9r  e8  g. for suitable choices of the simple
current, by comparing massless spectra and chiral rings one can identify them as special
point in the moduli space of linear sigma models. as an example consider the (k = 3)5
gepner model with r = 4 and choose

having gauge group so(10) and n16 = 80 generations, no antigeneration, n10 = 74 gauge
vectors and n1 = 350 gauge singlets. this agrees with the spectrum of the linear sigma
model

generalising this example in [3] we dened a nice subclass of models. given a gepner
model with k1 = 2  1. let d be the lowest common multiple of the numbers {ki : i =
1, . . . , 5}. for models with only four factors set k5 = 0. then the analysis of the chiral
ring reveals that a model obtained by using the following simple currents in the diagonal

roughly speaking one generates (0, 2) data from (2, 2) data automatically satisfying the
non-trivial anomaly constraints. this class of models provided a playground for further
study. mirror symmetry has become an important tool in exactly describing moduli spaces
of (2, 2) calabi-yau compactications. for (0, 2) models non-perturbative sigma model
and target space space corrections are under less control. at least in the class dened
above one can generate candidate dual pairs as for instance

ip1,1,1,1,2,2[4, 4]  v1,1,1,1,1[5]

ip51,60,80,65,128,128[256, 256]  v51,64,60,80,65[320].

(7)

starting with a (2, 2) mirror pair, one applies the transformation to get two (0, 2) models
with still mirror symmetric spectra. another approach to generate mirror pairs is by
orbifolding. to this end we developed orbifold techniques for (0, 2) landau-ginzburg
models in [4, 5]. we showed that by successive orbifolding of the model in (3) one obtains
a mirror symmetric set of models.

3 target space dualities

besides mirror symmetry, in the (0, 2) context one can imagine other target space dualities
at the perturbative level. it could happen that two models dened by calabi-yau threefold
and bundle data (m1, v1) and (m2, v2) are isomorphic as superconformal eld theories.
one way to realize such a duality exists in the framework of linear sigma models [7]. in
the landau-ginzburg phase the superpotential reduces to

s = z d2zdhjwj(i) + pafa(i)i ,

with p = hp i,

(8)

where wj dene the hypersurfaces in a weighed projective space and fa the bundle. in
our former notation this denes a model

ip1,...,n [d1, . . . , dnd]  vn1,...,nnn [m].

(9)

the parameters i, dj, na, m are related to the u(1) charges of the corresponding super-
elds i, j, a, p in the gauged linear sigma model. in (8) manifold and bundle data
appear on equal footing so that it might be possible that two dierent sets of geometric
data lead to the same landau-ginzburg models. it was believed for some time that the
landau-ginzburg point is like a transition point from one (0, 2) model to another [7]. in
[6] it was argued that a dierent scenario occurs, namely that the two models are isomor-
phic at every point in moduli space. the argument was based on an exact computation
of the dimensions of the geometric moduli spaces including complex, kahler and bundle
moduli. as an example consider the quintic

and a resolution of

ip4[5] with deformation of t

ip1,1,1,1,1,3[4, 4]  v1,1,1,2[5].

(10)

(11)

they have the same landau-ginzburg locus. using techniques from toric geometry and
homological algebra one can compute the exact dimensions of various cohomology groups.
the gauge group in both models is e6  e8. they both have the same number of gen-
erations h 1(m, v ) = 101 and antigenerations h 1(m, v ) = 1. for the rst model the
number of complex, kahler and bundle moduli is h 1(m1, t ) = 101, h 1(m1, t ) = 1 and
h 1(m1, end(t )) = 224 adding up to a total of 326 moduli. for the second model the

3

numbers are h 1(m1, t ) = 86, h 1(m1, t ) = 2 and h 1(m1, end(v )) = 238 amazingly
adding up to 326, as well. in all the examples studied, the number of geometric moduli
agreed completely where of course the individual contributions of the three kinds of mod-
uli got exchanged. with such high dimensional moduli spaces involved it is dicult to
determine the exact map between various moduli. furthermore, one might asked whether
such dualities are of any use for exact non-perturbative computations like for (2, 2) mirror
symmetry. all the non-renormalization theorems holding for (2, 2) models are generically
not true for (0, 2).
