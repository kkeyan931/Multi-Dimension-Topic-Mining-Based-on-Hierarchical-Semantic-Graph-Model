abstract

the system of d1 and d5 branes with a kaluza-klein momentum is re-

investigated using the ve-dimensional u-duality group e6(+6)(z). we show

that the residual u-duality symmetry that keeps this d1-d5-kk system in-

tact is generically given by a lift of the weyl group of f4(+4), embedded as a

nite subgroup in e6(+6)(z). we also show that the residual u-duality group

is enhanced to f4(+4)(z) when all the three charges coincide. we then apply

the analysis to the ads3/cft2 correspondence, and discuss that among 28

marginal operators of cft2 which couple to massless scalars of ads3 gravity

at boundary, 16 would behave as exactly marginal operators for generic d1-

d5-kk systems. this is shown by analyzing possible three-point couplings

among 42 kaluza-klein scalars with the use of their transformation properties

under the residual u-duality group.

1 introduction

since the ads/cft conjecture was proposed [1], brane systems of various type have been

investigated to examine the adsp+1/cftp correspondence [2]. among them, ads3/cft2

has been studied extensively, because cft2 is easy to investigate due to its innite-

dimensional symmetry, which in turn enables the detailed comparison between the cft2

and the ads3 supergravity in the near horizon. there, systems with d1 and d5-branes

have played important roles since they will have an ads3 geometry in the noncompact

directions after the near-horizon limit is taken appropriately.

for example, d1-d5-brane systems without a kaluza-klein (kk) momentum wrapped
on s1  k3 or s1  t 4 describe ads3  s3  n in the near horizon with n being k3 or
t 4 [3]. such d1-d5 systems have also drawn much attention because their dimensional

reductions are related to ve-dimensional black holes [4]. in fact, if we compactify the type

iib string theory on a ve-dimensional torus t 5 with internal coordinates (y1, . . . , y5), and
wrap q5 d5-branes on t 5 and q1 d1-branes along the y5-direction, then this d1-d5-brane
system describes a ve-dimensional black hole in the noncompact directions (x0, . . . , x4)

with vanishing horizon area, i.e. with vanishing bekenstein-hawking entropy.

black holes with nonvanishing horizon area can also be obtained by adding kk mo-

menta in the d1-direction. the near-horizon limit of this d1-d5-kk system then becomes
btz  s3  t 4. the btz black hole is known to be locally equivalent to ads3 [5].

the systems with nonvanishing kk momentum charge qk 6= 0 have a quite dierent
near-horizon behavior from that with qk = 0. this can be seen for 42 kk scalars that
appear when type iib strings are compactied on t 5. in fact, for qk = 0, these 42 scalars
will be split into three parts: 20 minimal scalars with m2 = 0, 16 intermediate scalars

with m2 = 3, and 6 xed scalars with m2 = 8 [3]. here we have set the radius of the

ads3 to be unity. the 16 intermediate scalars, ga5, ba5, ca5 and cabc5 (a, b, c = 1, . . . , 4),

come as kk scalars out of the metric, ns-ns 2-form, r-r 2-form and r-r self-dual 4-

form, respectively. the mass of these intermediate scalars near the horizon is expected to

change discontinuously if the kk charge is turned on. klebanov, rajaraman and tseytlin

[6] actually showed, setting ba5 = cabc5 = 0, that the uctuations of ga5 and ca5 all have
the same mass (m2 = 3) at the horizon if qk = 0, while for qk 6= 0, they split into
two groups, (ga5 + ca5) and (ga5  ca5), with the mass squared at the horizon equal to

2

m2 = 0 and m2 = 8, respectively. it thus seems natural to guess that when taking into
account the uctuations of all the intermediate scalars with qk 6= 0, they will be also
split into two parts, one half joining minimal scalars (m2 = 0) and another half joining

xed scalars (m2 = 8).

moduli space of the corresponding supersymmetric system was analyzed in [7], show-

ing that the d1-d5-kk systems actually have 28 massless scalars and 14 massive scalars
(m2 = 8) at the horizon. from the ads3/cft2 correspondence, the 28 massless scalars

may couple to marginal operators ( = 2). however, it is possible that these marginal

operators have dierent behaviors under the renormalization group if higher-order correc-

tions are taken into account. in particular, it is of much interest to know how many are

exactly marginal among 28 marginal operators.

the type ii string theory compactied on t 5 is known to have the u-duality group

e6(+6)(z) [8, 9, 10]. so, it may be useful if we can investigate the d1-d5-kk systems using

the u-duality as a complementary tool. although u-duality transformations generally

bring the d1-d5-kk systems to some other brane systems, if the subgroup that keeps the

systems intact is rich enough, then it may constrain the system purely from the symmetry

principle, giving us useful information on the system.

one of the main aims of the present article is to show that such residual u-duality

symmetry for the three-charge systems is given by a lift of the weyl group of f4(+4),

fw (f4(+4)), in e6(+6)(z). we also show that the use of the lifted weyl group enables us

to obtain further information on the 42 scalars.

in general, the kk scalars live on a coset manifold and transform non-linearly under

the u-duality if all auxiliary elds are removed. this sometimes makes it dicult to study

the scalar sector group-theoretically. however, as far as the lifted weyl group is concerned,

there exists a parametrization of the coset manifold such that scalars transform linearly.

since the residual u-duality group is of this type, we can resort to the representation

theory to determine possible three-point couplings of these scalars, and to discuss which

massless scalars couple to exactly marginal operators.

in sec. 2, we discuss the general u-duality group for type ii strings compactied on

a d-dimensional torus t d, and show that it can be expressed as the semidirect product

of the lifted weyl group and the borel group of ed+1(d+1). in sec. 3, we treat the d = 5

3

case in detail. we show that, when the three charges (q1, q5, qk) take positive integers

generically, the residual u-duality group g is given by the lifted weyl group of f4(+4),

g = fw (f4(+4)), while g is enhanced to f4(+4)(z) in the special case when q1 = q5 =

qk. in sec. 4, after introducing a convenient parametrization of the coset manifold, we

determine possible three-point couplings of scalars by using a representation of g, and

give an evidence that 16 operators would behave as exactly marginal operators. sec. 5 is

devoted to discussions.

2 u -duality and weyl-borel group

we start our discussion with recalling a general property of type ii strings compactied on

a d-dimensional torus t d. we will decompose the 10-dimensional coordinates as (x) =

(x, yi) = (x0, . . . , x9d, y1, . . . , yd) with yi (i = 1, . . . , d) denoting the coordinates on
t d. this system is conjectured to have the u-duality group ed+1 (d+1)(z) as an exact

symmetry [9, 10]. it is known that this group can be generated by a set of generators
{exp (e)} [11, 12]. here e are step operators of ed+1 (d+1) (the normal real form of
ed+1) and  are the positive roots. for our purposes, however, it is convenient to take

another set of generators which we will call weyl and borel generators, and express the

u-duality group as the following semidirect product:

ed+1(d+1)(z) = fw (ed+1(d+1))  b(ed+1(d+1)).

(2.1)

here the borel subgroup b(ed+1(d+1)) consists of the borel generators of the form {exp (e)}
with positive roots  > 0, while the lifted weyl group fw (ed+1(d+1)) is obtained by

lifting the elements of the weyl group w (ed+1) into ed+1 (d+1)(z) [13, 14]. here the

weyl group w (ed+1) is generated by weyl reections w that act on weights  as

w() =   (2  /  ) , and fw (ed+1(d+1)) is generated by the lift of w dened

by

n, e+ satisfy n, = n,   r. furthermore, for simply-laced lie algebras with
the normalization 2 = 2 for the roots, one can easily see that n, only takes 0 or 1,
and

the simplest example is the u-duality (or s-duality itself) of 10-dimensional type iib

strings, sl(2; z), which is generated by the weyl and the borel generators s and t :

the weyl-borel-group structure of the general ed+1(d+1)(z) can be understood easily

by decomposing it with respect to the t-duality subgroup o(d, d; z).

it is known that the so(d, d; z) can be generated by these generators [15].

ed+1 (d+1) is obtained by extending o(d, d) with the addition of one more simple root1
0 such that 0  1 = 1 and 0  i = 0 for i = 2, . . . , d (see fig. 1). for d  5, ed+1(d+1)

this s exchanges the b2 with d2  c2 + b2 c0 that was introduced in [16].

3 d = 5 and the residual u -duality group g

now we discuss the ve-dimensional u-duality group e6(+6)(z). there, the 27 vector
elds ai
 and the corresponding charges zi (i = 1, . . . , 27) transform as 27 of e6(+6) (see
fig. 2). this representation has the cubic invariant i3(27) = cijkzi zj zk. it is known
that for i3(27) 6= 0, the 27 charges can be rotated by f4(+4) into the systems where only
three of them (q1, q2, q3) do not vanish [17]:

zi = (0, . . . , 0, q1, 0, . . . , 0, q2, 0, . . . , 0, q3, 0, . . . , 0)

systems.

the 42 kk scalars, on the other hand, live on the coset space e6(+6)(r)/usp(8), where

usp(8) is the maximal compact subgroup of e6(+6)(r), and the equivalence relation for
l  e6(+6)(r) is introduced as l  l for l = g  l with an element g  usp(8). one
parametrization of l is given by the iwasawa decomposition:3

l(i, ) = exp(cid:16)x hii(cid:17) exp x>0

another one, which respects the structure of the weyl group, is given by

l(i, ) = exp(cid:16)x hii(cid:17) exp x>0

(e + e)! .

(3.3)

we assume that the scalars have their classical values only at the cartan part.

under the so(5, 5) subgroup, 27 of e6(+6) is decomposed as 1+ 10v + 16c. we denote
these singlet, vector and majorana-weyl (conjugate-) spinor charges of so(5, 5) by u, va

(a = 1, . . . , 10) and s ( = 1, . . . , 16), respectively. we also denote the fundamental
weights of e6 (+6) by r (r = 0, . . . , 5) with 2 (r  s)/(s  s) = r  s = r
s. throughout
the paper, we let the long roots have length squared equal to two. then under the

convention of fig. 2, the singlet charge u corresponds to the highest weight 0 of 27,

and comes from eb12345, the electromagnetic dual of the singlet ns-ns 2-form b in

the noncompact 5 dimensions. the vector charges all come from the ns-ns gauge elds
(b i, ai

) (i = 1, . . . , 5), where ai

 is the kk gauge eld. 16 spinor charges come from
the r-r gauge elds d  = (d 1, . . . , d 5, d 123, . . . , d 345, d 12345), where d is the

modied r-r potential that is obtained by suitably combining the original r-r potential

with the ns-ns 2-form [16]. the cubic invariant of 27 is then decomposed with respect

to so(5, 5) as

i3(27) = cijkzi zj zk = ujabvavb +

1
22

va(ca)ss.

(3.4)

here jab is the so(5, 5) invariant tensor, a is the gamma matrices of so(5, 5) satisfying
{a, b} = 2jab, and c is the charge conjugation matrix.

since borel generators move the classical values for scalars out of the cartan, we only

need to consider the lifted weyl group fw (e6(+6)), looking for the subgroup that keeps the
generic three-charge system intact. since an element of fw (e6(+6)) maps a three-charge

system to another, we can set three charges at any weights (1, 2, 3) we like, as long

as they satisfy the condition 1 + 2 + 3 = 0. there are two types of choice in view of

so(5, 5) [20]. the rst one is to set the charges only at the rst term of (3.4). as is clear

from fig. 2, all of the nonvanishing charges are related to ns-ns elds. we thus call this

choice the gauge of ns type. another choice is to set the charges at the second term of

(3.4), and will be called the gauge of r type. in particular, if we give charges for the gauge
elds (d12345, d5, a5
) of the d1-d5-kk system, then this is given by an r-type gauge.
we will especially call this choice the r(amond) gauge. on the other hand, its s-dual

the residual u-duality group g which does not change the charge vector up to per-

mutations of the three charges (q1, q2, q3) can be easily determined by the following

consideration. first, we take the ns gauge above, and notice that the three weights

1, 
3 span a two-dimensional subspace r2 in the six-dimensional weight space
of e6. since weyl reections induce orthogonal transformations in the weight space, the

2 and 

elements of the residual-symmetry group should be the lifts of those elements of w (e6)
that transform the subspace r2 and its orthogonal complement r4 into themselves, re-
spectively. on the other hand, it is easy to see that this r4 is spanned by 1, . . . , 4,
since r is the dual basis of r. furthermore, these simple roots 1, . . . , 4 constitute

a simple-root system of d4(+4) subalgebra of e6(+6). thus, these transformations will

induce automorphisms of the root lattice of d4(+4), which is a sublattice of the weight
lattice of e6(+6).4 the group consisting of such automorphisms is given by the semidirect

product of the outer automorphism group s3 and the weyl group w (d4), and known to

be isomorphic to the weyl group of f4, w (f4) = s3  w (d4). this f4 is embedded

in e6(+6) as a subalgebra f4(+4), as is shown in appendix. interestingly, elements of this

outer automorphism have a one-to-one correspondence with the permutations among the

1, 

2, 

three weights 
the triplet (1, 2, 4) correspond to the ones on (

3. explicit calculation using (2.4)(2.7) shows that permutations on
1). we thus conclude that the
residual u-duality group g of the three-charge system is generically given by the lifted

3, 

2, 

weyl group of the subalgebra f4(+4), embedded in the lifted weyl group of e6(+6):

g = fw (f4(+4))(cid:16) fw (e6(+6))(cid:17) .

(3.6)

we comment that this conclusion needs to be modied in the case q1 = q2 = q3. in

fact, as can be easily seen from the folding procedure in appendix, the little group of

the charge vector zi is enlarged for this case such as to include some borel generators,

given by {0 + 1, 2, 3, 4}.

which constitute the borel subgroup of f4(+4)(z). thus, for this special case, the residual

u-duality group can be thought to be enhanced to g = f4(+4)(z) as far as the charge

vectors are concerned [21].

our group g = fw (f4(+4)) is generated by the lifts of the weyl reections with respect

a (a = 1, . . . , 4) of the subalgebra f4(+4). the step operators asso-
ciated to the simple roots are determined in appendix, and are given in terms of e6(+6)

the lifts of the weyl reections with respect to them, ew 

are thus

all the above can be translated into our original d1-d5-kk system in the r gauge by
further taking the s-dual of the system in the ns gauge. the step operators associated

with the simple roots a of f4(+4) can be calculated by ea = ew0  e 

written in terms of e6(+6) generators as

a  ew1

 

0 , and are

e1 = e3,

e2 = e4,

e3 = e1+2+3 +e(1+3+4),

e4 = e0+1+3+4+5 +e(2+3+4+5) .

(3.9)

the generators of the residual u-duality symmetry in the r gauge are thus

ew1 = ew3

11

ew2 = ew4
ew3 = ew1+2+3  (ew1+3+4)1
ew4 = ew0+1+3+4+5  (ew2+3+4+5)1 .

(3.10)

the rest of the generators of the subalgebra f4(+4) in the r gauge are obtained by

taking the commutators of (3.9), which yield 12 long and 12 short, positive roots. the
step operators el for long roots are generally given by e with a root  of e6(+6) (not
necessary positive), while the step operators es for short roots generally have the form
e  e with some roots  and  of e6(+6) (again not necessary positive). the cartan
generators ha = [ea, ea] are given by

h1 = h3, h2 = h4, h3 = h2h4, h4 = h0 + h1h2.

(3.11)

their orthogonal complement in the cartan subalgebra of e6(+6) with respect to the

killing metric are spanned by

j1 = h0 + h1 + h2 + 2h3 + 2h4 + 2h5 ,

j2 = 2h1 + h2 + 2h3 + h4.

(3.12)

in general, if the step operators associated with the simple roots 3, 4 are written as

e3 = e(3)  e

e4 = e(4)  e

(3.13)

then the linear basis of the orthogonal complement, jr, can be given by

(3)i ,

j2 =he(4), e(4)i he

(4)

(4)i , (3.14)

as can be easily checked.

4 classication of scalar multiplets

we now classify the 42 scalars with respect to the residual u-duality group g = fw (f4(+4)).

we take the parametrization (3.3) for the scalar manifold e6(+6)(r)/usp(8).
eral, the scalar elds (i, ) transform non-linearly under the u-duality transformations.

in gen-

however, if we restrict the u-duality to the lifted weyl group fw (e6(+6)), these scalars
transform linearly. in fact for ew  fw (e6(+6)), we have

(4.1)

l(i, )  ew1 = ew1  ew  l(i, )  ew1

12

 ew1  l(cid:16)  i,   (cid:17)
 l(cid:16)  i,   (cid:17) ,

since the lifted weyl group of e6(+6) is a subgroup of the maximal compact subgroup

under the lifted weyl group always reduces to a (linear) representation of the weyl group

usp(8): ew  fw (e6(+6))  usp(8). we comment that the transformation of the elds i
w (e6), since the cartan generators hi = [ei, ei] transform as w hi w1 =pj hj wji
(cid:16)w(i) =pj j wji(cid:17) without any extra factors (see (2.4)(2.7)). they correspond to the

dilatonic scalars considered in [22].

it is known that the scalar manifold of d = 5 maximal supergravity has the following

n = 2 decomposition [23]

e6(+6)/usp(8) = f4(+4)/usp(6)usp(2) + su (6)/usp(6).

(4.2)

the rst term is expected to correspond to 28 massless scalars and the second to 14

massive scalars. with our parametrization, this decomposition is expressed as

haa +

jrr! 

2xr=1

l = exp  4xa=1
 exp x+

l

(e + e) 

l + x+

s

(e + e) 

s + x+

s

(x + x)

(4.3)

s .

l and +
here +
s are the set of long and short, positive roots of f4(+4), respectively. when
e with   +
s is written as e = e  e in terms of e6(+6) generators ( and  need
not be positive), we dene its complement x by x  e  e. for them, the elds 
and  in (3.3) are mapped into


s =

1

2 (cid:16)  (cid:17) , 

s =

1

2 (cid:16)  (cid:17) ,

(4.4)

as can be checked easily by equating (e + e)  + (e + e)  to (e + e) 
s +
(x + x) 
s. the cartan ha (a = 1, . . . , 4) are again dened by ha  [ea, ea] for the
simple roots a of f4(+4), and jr are dened as their orthogonal complements with respect
to the killing metric (see (3.12)). we denote 28 scalars (a, 
f4(+4)/usp(6)usp(2) by (4, 12
by (2+, 12+

s) which parametrize
s) for su (6)/usp(6)
s ). here we assign parity to the elds which will be useful in considering

l, 
s ), and 14 scalars (r, 

l , 12

the three-point functions.

13

these scalars transform linearly under the lifted weyl group fw (f4(+4)). let  and
gij (1 i, j 5) be the ten-dimensional dilaton and the metric of t 5 in the string frame,
respectively. we made the following identication for the dilatonic scalars:

a (4) :

e21 = e2 (g33g44) ,
e22 = e4 (g22g33g2
44) ,
e23 = e3 (g22g33g44) ,
e24 = e2 (g11g22g33g44)1/2 ,

r (2+) : e61 = e2 (g11g22g33g44g4

55)1/2 ,

e62 = e (g11g22g33g44g55) .

(4.5)

it is easy to check that this identication is actually consistent with various transfor-

mations of the u-duality. for the d1-d5-kk system in the r gauge, we regard these

dilatonic scalar elds as the sum of nonvanishing classical backgrounds and uctuations,

while other scalar elds purely as uctuations. taking a linear approximation for the

uctuations, the scalar elds  (see (3.3)) associated with the roots (2.13) can then be

identied as follows:

(1)
(2)

ij = gij + . . . ,

ij = bij + . . . ,

(4.6)

({ni}) = d({ni}) + . . . .

here ({ni}) is a multi-index determined by a set {ni} : ({ni}) = 1n12n23n34n45n5.
for example, ({1, 0, 1, 0, 0}) corresponds to the kk scalar d13. thus, under the linear
approximation, the scalars 12

s can be identied as

l , 12

s and 12+


l (12

s (12

s (12+

l ) : gab , dab ,
s ) : ga5 + da5 , ba5 + 1
s ) : ga5  da5 , ba5  1

3!abcddbcd5 , bab + 1
3! abcddbcd5 , bab  1

2 abcdbcd , d + d1234 ,
2abcdbcd , d  d1234 .

(4.7)

the range of indices a and ab should be understood as a = 1, . . . , 4 and 1  a < b  4.
note that this da5 equals to ca5 under this approximation. this identication is thus

consistent with the splitting of ga5 and ca5 observed in [6].

if we schematically write the exponent of (4.3) as

xr

dim rxm=1 | r, mi  r

m

14

(4.8)

with r = 4, 12

l , 12

s , 2+ and 12+

s , then one can introduce the analogue of 3j-symbols

that are dened as the coecient in the following expansion when a singlet 1 exists in
the tensor product r1  r2  r3:

| 1iii = xm1,m2,m3 | r1, m1 i  | r2, m2 i  | r3, m3 i 

r1

r2

r3

m1 m2 m3

 .

(4.9)

they are set to be zero when no singlets appear in the tensor product.

the 3j-symbols can be explicitly calculated as follows. first, we represent the step

and determine the 3j-symbols by requiring that the expression on the right hand side of

operators of e6(+6) on 27. we then calculate the matrix representation of ew  fw (f4(+4)),
(4.9) be invariant under the action of all ews. the result is that the 3j-symbols can have

nonvanishing values only for the following ve cases:

(r1, r2, r3) = (12

s , 12

s , 2+), (12+

s , 12+

s , 2+), (2+, 2+, 2+),

(4.10)

(12

s , 12

s , 12+

s ), (12+

s , 12+

s , 12+

s ).

this is actually consistent with the assignment of parity. note that the 3j-symbols vanish
whenever 4 or 12

l enters the expression.

5 discussion

the result obtained in the previous section leads to an interesting interpretation in the

ads3/cft2 correspondence. on the ads3 supergravity side, suppose that we expand the

action around the classical d1-d5-kk background and integrate over all the elds other

than scalars. the resulting interaction terms for the 42 scalars should be a singlet for our

residual u-duality group, and thus can be expanded in the above scalar multiplets with
the 3j-symbols as coecients. the vanishing of the 3j-symbols including 4 or 12

l thus

implies that there are no interaction terms for this 16 scalars. on the other hand, from

the cft2 point of view, by regarding the scalar elds  r
operators o r
to corrections to the scaling relation in the renormalization group equation:

m as the sources of the scaling
m of the boundary cft, the coecients of the interaction term correspond

 r

with some constants c r r1r2. thus, from the vanishing of the 3j-symbols for r = 4 or
12

l with r = 2, we may conclude up to this order, that these 4 and 12

l couple to

exactly marginal operators, and express the real moduli at the horizon.

we here should make a comment. when more than one couplings enter the renor-

malization group equation, the second coecients can be highly nonuniversal even for

marginal operators with r = 2. however, one can easily show that vanishing coe-

cients still remain to be zero universally if the renormalization group respects the residual

u-duality symmetry and we allow only eld redenitions which respect the symmetry.

nonvanishing coecients, on the other hand, can change rather arbitrarily. this would

ensure the stability of our conclusion.

in this article, we considered the residual u-duality group g for the three-charge

systems. when (q1, q2, q3) take generic positive integers, g is found to be the lift of

the weyl group of f4(+4), g = fw (f4(+4)), being a subgroup of e6(+6)(z). we then
classied the 42 scalars into 4, 12
s . the splitting of ga5 and da5
into ga5  da5 in [6] can thus be naturally explained in the light of the lifted weyl
group w (f4(+4)) (see (4.4)). we further considered the possible three-point couplings,
and showed that they always vanish when 4 or 12
l enters the expression. this implies

s , 2+ and 12+

l , 12

that conformal invariance is preserved at least to this order under the perturbation with

respect to the operators coupling to these elds at boundary. this should be regarded as

an evidence that these 16 operators are exactly marginal. we are not able to determine
whether the rest 12 marginal operators (corresponding to 12

s ) are also exactly marginal

or not, only from the argument based on the weyl group.

on the other hand, if all the three charges coincide, q1 = q2 = q3, then the residual

u-duality group is enhanced to g = f4(+4)(z) as far as the charge vectors are concerned.
under the action of the full f4(+4)(z), the three multiplets 4, 12
into a single multiplet of 28 dimensions, and thus all the three-point couplings including
12

s also vanish. this may in turn imply that the operators corresponding to 12

s are combined

l and 12

s break

the symmetry f4(+4)(z) to its subgroup fw (f4(+4)).

investigate if this property of 12

l can be interpreted through the renormalization group

if so, it would be interesting to

16

or in terms of attractor [24].

appendix: f4(+4) in e6(+6)

the embedding of f4(+4) in e6(+6) can be understood most simply if we take another

r-type gauge (to be called the canonical gauge) with d3-d1-f1 charges at the weights

all being at level 8 (see fig. 2):

gauge

gauge elds

weights

canonical gauge (d123, d4, b5)

(1, 2, 3) = (14, 01+45,0+5)

in fact, we rst note that w0w5 exchanges 2 and 3, and w1w4 exchanges 1 and 2.
thus, w0w5 and w1w4 generate permutations of the three charges. we then lift them

together with w2 and w3:

ew1  ew2,
ew2  ew3,
here ew3 can be rewritten as
ew3 = exp(cid:18)
= exp(cid:18)

ew3  ew1ew4,
(e1e1)(cid:19)  exp(cid:18)
2 {(e1 +e4)(e1 +e4)}(cid:19) .

ew4  ew0ew5.
(e4e4)(cid:19)

ew4 can also be rewritten similarly. we thus can express ewa (a = 1, . . . , 4) as

ewa = exp(cid:18)

2 (cid:16)e ae a(cid:17)(cid:19)

with

e 1  e2 ,

e 2  e3 ,

e 3  e1 +e4,

e 4  e0 +e5.

(a.4)

these e a generate f4(+4) as the invariant lie subalgebra of e6(+6) under the z2 automor-
phism of the e6 dynkin diagram: 0  5, 1  4, 2  2, 3  3. what we did
here can thus be understood as the folding procedure to obtain f4(+4) from e6(+6) with the

z2 automorphism (see fig. 3). the operators e a then correspond to the step operators
associated with the f4(+4) simple roots a with length 2

2 = 2 and 2

1 = 2

3 = 2

4 = 1.

one can easily show that the ns gauge with (
i = w (i) with the weyl group element:

gauge as 

1, 

2, 

3) is related to this canonical

w   w0w1w3w4w2+3+4+5w1+3+4+5 ,

while the r gauge with (1, 2, 3) is related to the canonical gauge with

w = w0  w  = w1w3w4w2+3+4+5w1+3+4+5.

(a.5)

(a.6)

the step operators associated with the simple roots  

a  w ( a) (ns gauge) or a  w( a)

(r gauge) can then be calculated by

e
 
a

= ew  e a ew  1
ea = ew e a ew1

(ns gauge),

(r gauge) .

(a.7)

by representing all the step operators of e6(+6) as 27  27 matrices on the representation
27, one can carry out the above calculation explicitly to obtain (3.7) and (3.9). ambigui-

ties may arise when lifting the elements of the weyl group, but they can be essentially xed

by requiring that the lifted elements should rotate positive charges to positive charges.
