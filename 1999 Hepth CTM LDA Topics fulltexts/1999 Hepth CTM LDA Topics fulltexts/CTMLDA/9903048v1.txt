abstract

an s-matrix is dened for anti-de sitter space by constructing in and out states

that asymptote to the timelike boundary. an analog of the lsz formula shows that this

boundary s-matrix is given directly by correlation functions in the boundary conformal

theory. this provides a key entry in the ads to cft dictionary.

the conjectured ads/cft correspondence[1] has oered a promising new window

into the dynamics of string/m theory. but in order to exploit this powerful framework,

we must decipher the holographic relationship between the bulk and boundary theories.

gubser, klebanov, and polyakov[2] and witten[3] made important progress in this regard

by providing a cft to ads dictionary: they show how to derive cft correlation functions

from the bulk theory in ads. this has allowed the successful calculation of various cft

correlators.

however, in order to study bulk physics, and in particular to understand the undoubt-

edly profound implications of holography, a reverse dictionary is needed: we need to know

which bulk quantities can be calculated, and how to calculate them, from the boundary

cft. another important and closely related question is how to treat scattering in ads.

due to the periodicity of particle orbits and lack of ordinary asymptotic states in ads, a

conventional s-matrix cannot be dened.1 however, [4] outlined the denition of an ads

analog of the s-matrix in terms of scattering of states from the timelike innity. refs. [5,6]

gave a related denition in the innite-n limit. the purpose of the present note will be

to go further and provide an intrinsic and explicit denition of this boundary s-matrix

for arbitrary n , and to give a precise relation between it and the cft correlators. the

discussion also claries the relation between the framework of [5,6] and that of [4]. other

recent treatments of related aspects of the ads/cft dictionary include[7,8,9].

to summarize in advance, the boundary s-matrix will be dened as an overlap of

certain in and out states. these will be dened so that they correspond to particles

asymptotic to the timelike boundary of ads in the past/future. an ads analog of the lsz

formula can then be derived and relates this s-matrix to the bulk correlation functions.

finally the results of [3] are used to rewrite the boundary s-matrix in terms of the cft

correlation functions. an extremely simple relationship results: the boundary s-matrix

equals the corresponding cft correlator. this serves as a key entry in the ads to cft

dictionary.

for simplicity we will consider scalar elds, with action

s = z dv (cid:20) 1

2 + u ()(cid:21) ,

1 see [4] for more discussion.

where u summarizes the interaction terms. the generalization to other elds should be

straightforward. we will work in global coordinates x = (t, , ) for adsd+1,

ds2 = r2( sec2  dt2 + sec2  d2 + tan2  d2

d1) ,

(2)

although translation to poincare coordinates should also be straightforward.

certain facts about the solutions to the free equations will be useful in the following.

the eective gravitational potential of anti-de sitter space connes particles to its interior.

solutions to the free equation

(  m2) = 0

(3)

therefore exist at arbitrary frequency , but are only normalizable (in the klein-gordon

norm) for a discrete set of frequencies. dene the parameters h and  by

normalizable solutions with denite angular momenta are of the form

2pd2 + 4m2 .

and have asymptotic behavior

(5)

(6)

for some constants knl. explicit formulas for these solutions are given in [10]. the discrete
eigenfrequencies are

nl = 2h+ + 2n + l , n = 0, 1, 2,    .

non-normalizable solutions we will write as

these have asymptotic behavior

l ~m = eityl ~ml() .

l

/2
 (cos )2h ,

(7)

(8)

(9)

where a convenient normalization convention has been chosen by xing the overall constant.

we will also require some assumptions about the spectrum. this is classied according

to the representations of so(d, 2). a given representation is determined by its weight 

2

(which corresponds to the conformal weight in the cft), and contains states |; n, l, ~mi.

here n is the principal quantum number and l, ~m are the standard angular quantum

numbers, as above. the energy, dened with respect to global time, is given by

for a free eld,



n =  + 2n + l .

 = 2h+ .

(10)

(11)

we assume that the states of the interacting scalar theory consist of the vacuum,

|0i, the single particle states, |; n, l, ~mi, and multiparticle states |; n, l, ~mi where 
is an additional state label. for the interacting eld  may be renormalized and is not

necessarily given in terms of the bare mass by (11). we also assume that

 > 

(12)

for all multi-particle states.

some useful properties of the bulk-boundary propagator are also needed. suppose

that we seek a solution of the free equation (3) satisfying the boundary condition

/2
 (cos )2hf (b) ,



(13)

where b = (t, ) denotes the boundary coordinates and f is some specied boundary

value. witten[3] denes the bulk-boundary green function to be the kernel that provides
the solution:2

(x) =z dbf (b)gb(b, x) .

(14)

explicit expressions for gb can then be found[3] using the resulting condition that gb
must asymptote to a delta function at the boundary.

it is easy to derive an alternate formula for gb in terms of the bulk feynman prop-
agator gb(x, x) using an ads variant of the usual greens theorem argument. consider
the solution  with the above boundary conditions (13). dene a region v by  <   /2.

using

( x  m2)gb(x, x) = (x, x)

(15)

2 though wittens denition was made in the euclidean continuation of ads, the formalism

naturally extends to lorentzian signature as discussed in [11,4].

3

we may rewrite  as

(x) = zv

dv (x)( x  m2)gb(x, x)

and then integrate twice by parts to nd

(x) = zv

d(x)


gb(x, x) .

at the boundary the feynman propagator scales as

gb(x, x)

/2
 (cos )2h+g(b, x) ,

(16)

(17)

(18)

for some function g. substituting this and the boundary behavior (13) into (17) gives

(x) = rd1z dbf (b)g(b, x) lim

/2

(tan )d1h(cos )2h

(cos )2h+i ,

with limit

(x) = 2rd1z dbf (b)g(b, x) .

comparison with (14) then shows

gb (b, x) = 2rd1 lim
/2

(cos )2h+gb(x, x) ,

(19)

(20)

(21)

in agreement with [12].

notice that (3), (13) do not uniquely specify the solution ; one may always add a

normalizable mode without modifying the boundary behavior (13). specically, suppose

that f (b) falls to zero in the far past and future. then in the asymptotic past and future 

must be a linear combination of the normalizable modes (5). with the preceding construc-

tion of gb, (14) gives the solution that is purely positive frequency in the far future, and

purely negative frequency in the far past. other solutions can be obtained by modifying

the temporal boundary conditions on the bulk green function, e.g. by using retarded or

advanced propagators.

note that the non-normalizable solutions l ~m can be recovered from (14); in the limit

f  eityl ~m, (9) coincides with (13). therefore

l ~m(x) =z dbeityl ~mgb(b, x)  gb (, l,  ~m; x) .

(22)

4

for a general f , we can therefore rewrite (14) in terms of the fourier transform fl ~m()

as

f (x) =z dbf (b)gb(b, x) =xl, ~mz d

2

fl ~m()l ~m(x)

(23)

for appropriately chosen f , this function denes a solution corresponding to a wavepacket.

the function f determines the packet prole.

these can be thought of as packets incident from innity in ads. notice that, ac-

cording to (9), they typically diverge at the boundary. there is a physical reason for this:

motion in the region near the boundary is classically forbidden. therefore the amplitude

for a particle incident from innity to reach the center of ads is suppressed by an innite

tunneling factor. however, the amplitude for a particle to reach the center of ads may

be kept nite by rescaling the wavefunction such that the incident amplitude at innity is

innite.

one concrete way to think of this is to imagine cutting o ads at large but nite radius

and patching the resulting ads bubble into a spacetime with a bona-de null innity, as

in [4]. a beam of particles from this asymptotic space can be focussed to collide with

another beam in the center of the ads region. most of the incident ux is reected o the

potential barrier resulting from the ads geometry, so in order for the beams to penetrate

to the center the incident amplitudes must be large. the wavepacket denitions above,

which are given intrinsically in ads without reference to an auxiliary bubble picture, can

be thought of as arising from the limit where the radius of the ads bubble goes to innity

while simultaneously scaling up the incident beam amplitudes.

these wavepackets can now be used to construct operators that create in and out

states.3 these asymptotic operators will be dened by

f = lim

/2z

d
f


  ,

(24)

where  = v for the region v dened above and  is the full interacting eld. we also

dene the plane wave limit of these operators,

l ~m = lim

/2z

d

l ~m


 .

(25)

3 refs. [5,6] outlined the construction of such operators in the innite-n limit. here we will

explicitly construct such operators for arbitrary n .

5

if  is replaced by the free eld,

 = xn,l, ~m

then (25) gives

anl ~meinltnl ~m + a

nl ~meinlt

nl ~m ,

l ~m = 4rd1xn

knlh(  nl)anl ~m + ( + nl)a

nl, ~mi

(26)

(27)

where the knl appeared in (6). this suggests that the positive and negative frequency
l ~ms be thought of as annihilation and creation operators, respectively.

this is conrmed by the following critical relations, which hold for the operators

constructed from the full interacting eld:

h0|f |; n, l, ~mi = 2rd1n ()knlf 

l ~m(nl) ,

h; n, l, ~m|f |0i = 2rd1n ()knlf 

l, ~m(nl) ,

and

h0|f |; n, l, ~mi = 0 ,

(28)

(29)

(30)

where n () is another constant. therefore f with positive-frequency f annihilates a
particle at the boundary, and with negative-frequency f creates a particle at the boundary.

furthermore, (30) implies that the f s only annihilate/create single particle states.

the rst of these relations is proved by recalling that by symmetry, the full interacting

eld must satisfy[13]

h0|(x)|; n, l, ~mi = n ()nl ~m(x)

(31)

for some normalization factor n (). then the denition (25) and a derivation like that

in (19)-(20) immediately gives (28). note that in order for this to be true the modes in

(23), (25) must be dened with the mass xed by 2h+ = , corresponding to using the

renormalized physical mass of the single particle state. analogous reasoning proves (29).

eq. (30) is shown by noting that, again purely from the so(d, 2) symmetry,

h0|(x)|; n, l, ~mi = n()


nl ~m(x) ,

(32)

where 


nl ~m is dened using the mass parameter corresponding to the multiparticle .
again, the matrix element (30) can be found from reasoning parallel to (19)-(20), but now

the result contains

lim

/2

(cos )  .

6

(33)

this vanishes by (12).

in and out states are now readily dened. for positive-frequency functions fi,

where the zi are wavefunction renormalization factors necessary to cancel normalization

(36)

(37)

these states in turn lead to construction of the boundary s-matrix. suppose that the
wavepackets fi, f 
future of that of all the fis. the boundary s-matrix is then dened as

j are non-overlapping, and that the support of all the f 

js lies to the

(38)

although the interpretation is less transparent, the same denition can be adopted for fi
and f 

j not satisfying the above conditions.
in at space, the s-matrix is related by the lsz formula to truncated correlation

functions. a similar formula can now be derived for the boundary s-matrix, which will
be given in terms of bulk correlation functions. consider a nite region v  dened like

v above, but with boundaries t , t of constant time t lying to the far past and far

future of the wavepackets support. gauss theorem applied to (24) gives

in

f =

(39)

where the t   limit is also understood. the surface term at t vanishes because f

is positive frequency and therefore vanishes in the far past. inside (38), the time ordering

7

takes the surface term at t to the left. we can then insert a complete set of states |si to
nd an expression of the form

df


h0||sihs|i .

(40)

this vanishes by (31). the bulk term is left, and after using the free equation for f and
taking t   becomes

immediately follows:

(42)

here the kinetic operator in (41) has removed the external legs, and the t subscript

denotes the resulting truncated green function.

the relation to correlation functions in the conformal eld theory now follows trivially.

witten[3] has shown that the cft correlators are given in terms of the truncated bulk

correlators and the bulk-boundary propagator as

htya

o(ba)i =z ya

these strikingly simple relations tells us that the cft correlators directly determine the

boundary s-matrix, and thus provide an extremely simple dictionary between scattering

amplitudes in anti-de sitter space and the conformal eld theory correlation functions.
