abstract

extended brst invariance (brst plus anti-brst invariances) provides in principle a nat-
ural way of introducing the complete gauge xing structure associated to a gauge eld theory in
the minimum representation of the algebra. however, as it happens in topological yang mills
theory, not all gauge xings can be obtained from a symmetrical extended brst algebra, where
antighosts belong to the same representation of the lorentz group of the corresponding ghosts.
we show here that, at non interacting level, a simple eld redenition makes it possible to start
with an extended brst algebra with symmetric ghost antighost spectrum and arrive at the
gauge xing action of topological yang mills theory.

it was shown by witten [1, 2] how to build up a quantum eld theory involving the vector
gauge potential whose partition functional generates topological invariants like the donaldson
polynomials. soon after that, baulieu and singer[3] have shown that this, so called topological
yang mills theory, can be obtained by an appropriate gauge xing of the topological invariant
classical action

their approach was to quantize the action (1) along the standard brst prescriptions but
writing out the brst transformations of the gauge elds as the sum of the brst transfor-
mations of standard yang mills theory plus a topological ghost  that by itself removes the
degrees of freedom associated with the gauge eld a

a =  + dc .

(2)

then the eld content of the theory is enlarged in order to gauge x the action, taking into
account the reducibility of (2).

the quantization procedure of ref. [3] is completely based on the sole brst invariance of
the gauge xing action. the antighosts and auxiliary elds are introduced as trivial pairs. they
do not belong to the minimum representation of the brst algebra. it is known however [4] that
one can associate to any classical gauge symmetry an extended brst (brst plus anti-brst)
algebra. one of the advantages of considering an extended algebra rather than a standard one
is that the antighosts and auxiliary elds enter in this formulation as basic ingredients of the
minimum representation of the algebra and not just as trivial pairs. the idea of introducing anti
brst transformations in topological yang mills theory was rst discussed in refs. [5] and [6].
an extended brst algebra associated with this theory was then presented in ref. [7]. however,
in this reference the connection with the action of baulieu and singer is only possible by means
of a gauge xing action involving terms with dierent scaling dimensions. they also use some
eld redenitions that do not preserve the dimension and the number of degrees of freedom.

the standard way of introducing the anti-brst transformations is to dene them in a sym-
metric way with respect to the brst ones. following this approach one introduces antighosts
in the same representation of the lorentz group as the corresponding ghosts. this would corre-
spond, in the case of the topological yang mills theory to an extended brst algebra that can
be written as[7]

1a =  + dc

1c = 1

2 =  2  [c ,  ]  [c, 2]
21 = 1  [c, 1]  [c, ]
22 = 2(cid:16)  [ c, ]  [c, 2](cid:17)
2 = 2(cid:16)  [ c, ]  [c, ](cid:17)
2b = 2  2(cid:16)[ c, c](cid:17)
2k = 2(cid:16)d + [c, ] + [c, ](cid:17)

where we are representing brst and anti-brst transformations respectively as 1 and 2 and
[ , ] means a graded commutator.

this symmetric approach leads to a simpler algebraic structure for the extended algebra.
however, in general not all gauge xings of a gauge theory can be implemented by using just
this kind of symmetrical ghost antighost pairs. this is what happens precisely in topological
yang mills theory. in order to enforce the self duality condition on f one has to introduce
a self dual anti symmetric antighost tensor + corresponding to the ghost vector [3]. the
dierence between the so called geometrical antighosts, like 
, that come from a symmetrical
extended formulation and the actual gauge xing antighosts, like + , normally introduced as
parts of trivial brst doublets was discussed in [8]. this reference introduces a general method
for starting with a completely symmetrical set of geometrical ghost antighost pairs and then,
by adding some trivial brst doublets, arrive at a gauge xing action corresponding to some
particular gauge xing. the idea there is to include some appropriate terms in the action that
will have the role of eliminating the unwanted variables from the model by a supersymmetric
compensation in the functional integration. this general mechanism is called a transmutation
of geometrical antighosts into gauge xing antighosts.



it was shown in [1] that the topological yang mills theory is independent of the coupling
constant provided this coupling is non vanishing. thus we will consider that the coupling is very

small and keep only the quadratic terms in the elds in our calculations. we will show here that
at this non interacting level we can arrive at the baulieu singer action from a double (brst
anti-brst) variation of a gauge xing boson. we will start with the symmetrical extended
ghost antighost set of (3) and (4) and make the following eld redenitions:

 = +
k = b+

 + 
 + d .

(5)

 and b+

where +
 are anti symmetric self dual tensor elds carrying three independent com-
ponents each one. so, equations (5) are just separating 4 = 3 + 1 , preserving the number of
degrees of freedom. now we dene the extended algebra associated to this set of elds at non
interacting level:

1a =  + c

1c = 1

1 = 1
11 = 0

1c = b

1+

1b = 0
 = b+

1 = 1

12 = 2
1b+
 = 0
1 = d

1d = 0

12 = 0

 , +  + c

2a = +
2 c = 2

2 = 2

22 = 0

2c =   b  d

2 =  + b+


2 = 0

21 = 1

22 = 0

2 = 0

2b = 2

2d = 2
 = 0 .

2b+

(7)

then we consider the gauge xing of topological yang mills action (1) by adding the gauge

xing action

sgf =  z d4x 1 2

t r(cid:16) aa + (c   )1

 c (c +  )(cid:17) ,

where all the terms have the appropriate scaling dimension. this action is dierent from the one
in [7] that involves the brst anti-brst variation of a sum involving terms aa and f  f
(without any mass parameter) that have dierent scaling dimensions. also our eld redenition
(5) is dierent from the one in [7], where + was introduced as the exterior derivative of ,
although these two quantities have dierent scaling dimensions.

using (6) and (7) , we nd after redening the elds

path integration over the elds  and  leads to functional deltas in d and . thus, integrating
over this four elds we arrive at the total action

this is the action found in reference [3], up to interaction terms that one can consider to
be arbitrarily small. thus we see that the eld redenitions of eq. (5) provide a simple way of
separating the relevant variables, that implement the gauge xing conditions

a = 0 ; f + f = 0 ;  = 0

(12)

from the other unnecessary variables. it is interesting to note also the way that the  and 
elds cancel just the unwanted parts of  and k .

the consistency of our procedure can be checked by looking at the dimensions of the elds:

[ a ] = [ c ] = [c ] = [ +
[  ] = [ 
] = [  ] = 2



 ] = [  ] = [  ] = 1

[  ] = 0
[  ] = [ b ] = [ b ] = [ d ] = 2
[  ] = [ k ] = 3

(13)

comparing our results with those of ref.[8] we see that we do not need to introduce any extra
eld besides the ones that belong to the extended algebra of equations (3) (4). the antighost
+
 comes naturally as part of  and the other part is naturally removed by the gauge xing.
we do not need extra brst doublets besides the extended algebra. however, it is important
to note that the results of [8] are general while the present ones hold for the particular case of
topological yang mills without interaction terms.
