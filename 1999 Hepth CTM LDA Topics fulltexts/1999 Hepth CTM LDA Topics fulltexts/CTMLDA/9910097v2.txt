abstract

spectral zeta functions (s) for the massless scalar elds obeying the dirichlet and neumann
boundary conditions on a surface of an innite cylinder are constructed. these functions are dened
explicitly in a nite domain of the complex plane s containing the closed interval of real axis 1 
re s  0. proceeding from this the spectral zeta functions for the boundary conditions given on a
circle (boundary value problem on a plane) are obtained without any additional calculations. the
casimir energy for the relevant eld congurations is deduced.

introduction

the zeta function technique is widely used in quantum eld theory, specically, for cal-
culation of the vacuum energy (the casimir energy) of quantized elds in compactied
conguration space.1,2,3 for the boundaries with spherical geometry this method has been
essentially worked out in papers.4 the casimir energy is determined by the value of the
corresponding zeta function (s) at a certain point (usually at s = 1). therefore, when it
regards the vacuum energy calculation, the zeta function is investigated only at a separate
point or at least in its innitesimal neighborhood.

however, in some problems it proves to be useful to construct explicitly the spectral
zeta function for a nite range of its argument s. for example, proceeding from the zeta
function for an innite cylinder cyl(s) dened in the domain 1  re s  0 one can
easily express both the casimir energy of a cylinder via cyl(1) and the casimir energy of a
circle in terms of cyl(0). such an approach has obvious advantage not only for shortening the
calculations (a unique zeta function is applicable to two problems) but also when treating the
divergences. for instance, the zeta function technique applied to the boundary conditions
given on the surface of an innite cylinder at once gives the nite value of the vacuum
energy5,6 (the renormalization is carried out simultaneously with the regularization). as for
the boundary conditions dened on a circle, the zeta function regularization is unable to
remove all the divergences. the answers obtained by dierent authors for the nite part of
the corresponding casimir energy do not coincide.7 in view of this it would be interesting
to express the spectral zeta function cir(s) in terms of cyl(s) which is already normalized
(being free of the divergences) at the point s = 1. it is this that we are going to do in the
present note.
the layout of the paper is as follows. in sec. ii we derive the relation between the zeta
functions for the boundary conditions given on the surface of an innite cylinder, cyl(s),
and on the circle, cir(s). in sec. iii the spectral zeta functions for the massless scalar elds
obeying the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions on the lateral area of an innite
cylinder are constructed explicitly. as in ref. 5 the central part is played here by the uniform
asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions. explicit formulas dening these zeta functions
in a nite region  of the complex plane s containing the closed interval of real axis 1 
re s  0 are derived. in sec. iv using these formulas we obtain the spectral zeta functions
for the relevant plane problem with the dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions given
on a circle. the casimir energies for the eld congurations in hand are calculated.
in
conclusion (sec. v) the obtained results are shortly discussed and compared with those of
other authors.

ii. relation between the spectral zeta functions for a cylin-
der and a circle

let us remind briey how to nd out the relation between the zeta function for a three di-
mensional problem with boundary conditions given on the lateral area of an innite cylinder
of radius a and the zeta function for a two dimensional problem with boundary conditions
given on a circle of the same radius. for simplicity in both cases the massless scalar eld
obeying the dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions is considered.

in the case of an innite cylinder the eigenfunctions are proportional to exp(it+ikzz +
in) where {r, , z} are cylindrical coordinates. the eigenfrequencies  inside the cylinder

2

for the dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are given respectively by the equations

for the outside region we have

jl(r)|r=a = 0 ,

j 
l (r)|r=a = 0 .

(2.2)

in order to construct the spectral zeta function for an innite cylinder or a circle one can

employ the standard denition

(s) = x{p}

(s

p ) .

(2.3)

here p are the eigenfrequencies of the scalar eld under certain boundary conditions, p
are the same frequencies when the boundaries are removed. the summation (or integration)
should be done over all the quantum numbers {p} specifying the spectrum. to make the
sum convergent the parameter s should belong to a region of the complex plane s where
re s is large enough. however for the massless elds considered here there also exists a
restriction for the maximal values of re s in order to ensure the convergent integration at
the origin (see below).

for a cylinder and a circle the general formula (2.3) looks as follows



cyl(s) = z 
cir(s) = xl,n

z )s/2i ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

with ln being dened by (2.1) and (2.2) for the both zeta functions. integration over kz in
(2.4) can be accomplished by making use of the formula

where b(x, y) is the euler beta function

b(x, y) = (x)(y)/(x + y).

comparing the result of the integration with (2.5) one arrives at the relation between cyl(s)
and cir(s)8

cyl(s) =

(2.6)

when calculating the casimir energy by making use of the zeta function technique usually
one puts9

ec =

(s = 1).

(2.7)

to use this formula, for example, in the case of a circle one should nd the analytic con-
tinuation of cir(s) into the point s = 1. on the other hand, in accordance with (2.6) the
zeta function cir(s) at the point s = 1 can be expressed through cyl(s = 0). thus the
analytic continuation of the zeta function cyl(s) into the region 1  re s  0 provides the
opportunity to calculate the casimir energy both for an innite cylinder and for a circle.

iii. spectral zeta functions for a cylinder with the dirich-
let and neumann boundary conditions

in ref. 5 a consistent procedure has been developed for constructing the spectral zeta
functions for the boundary conditions given on a sphere and on the lateral area of an innite
cylinder. here we follow the same approach and start with consideration of the spectral
zeta function cyl(s) for the massless scalar eld obeying the dirichlet boundary conditions
on an innite cylinder.

taking into account the contributions of the eld oscillations inside (eq. (2.1)) and outside
(eq. (2.2)) the cylinder and representing the sum over l in (2.4) in terms of contour integral
one obtains

(3.1)

the contour c consists of the imaginary axis (i, i) and a semi-circle of an innite
radius in the right half plane of a complex variable . keeping in mind the behavior of the
integrand at all the segments of the contour c and integrating over kz eq. (3.1) becomes5

(3.2)

then, in order to accomplish the analytic continuation of (3.2) into the region 1  re s < 0
we express cyl(s) in terms of the riemann zeta function with the well-known analytic
continuation. after changing the integration variable y  ny in (3.2) we employ the uniform
asymptotic expansion (uae) of the bessel functions10 up to the order n4

(3.10)

the function z1(s) corresponds to the rst term in the uae (3.3), z2(s) involves the contri-
bution of the 1/n2-order term of the latter together with the integral a(s), z3(s) is generated
by the terms of order 1/n4 in the expansion (3.3).

taking into account the asymptotics

2yi0(y)k0(y) = 2y ln y + (2 ln 2  2)y + o(y3),
2yi0(y)k0(y) = 1 +

(3.11)

where  is the euler constant, one can ascertain the domain of variation of the complex
variable s so that the integrals in (3.5)(3.8) exist. the ultraviolet behavior (y  ) of the
integrands in (3.5)(3.8) determines the lower bound for re s and the infrared one (y  0)
is responsible for the upper bound. formula (3.5) denes z0(s) as an analytic function of s
if 3 < re s < 1. when this condition holds one can perform in (3.5) the integration by
parts

z0(s) = (1  s)z

(3.12)

the integral dening z1(s) in (3.6) exists if 1 < re s < 1. the sum over n in this
formula is nite for re s > 2. as these two regions do not overlap, the introduction of the
parameter s in the original formula (2.3) does not regularize completely the divergences in
z1(s) on this stage of our consideration. an additional infrared regularization should be
used here, for example, by introducing the photon mass . as a result the integration in
eq. (3.6) will be restricted from below by , and the constraint re s < 1 will be removed.
the function z1(s), regularized in this way, can be used for required analytic continuation
(see below).

the integral in eq. (3.7) dening z2(s) exists when 1 < re s < 3. the sum over l
in (3.7) is nite when re s > 0. the integral in (3.8) converges if 3 < re s < 3. the
sum over n in this formula is nite for re s > 2. thus the regions, where the integrals
and the sums exist, overlap and these formulas can be used for constructing the analytic
continuation needed.

as it was stressed in the preceding section, we are interested in the evaluation of  d

cyl(s)
in the region  of the complex plane s containing the closed interval of the real axis 1 
re s  0. for the zeta function  d
cyl(s) dened by the sum (3.4) we shall construct the
analytic continuation into this region in the following way.

it has been already noticed that the functions z0(s) in (3.5) and z3(s) in (3.8) are analytic
in the region under consideration. in order to obtain the required analytic continuation of
the function z2(s) it as sucient to express the sum over n in (3.7) in terms of the riemann
zeta function

keeping in mind that we have introduced the photon mass  into eq. (3.6) we can
substitute here the sum in terms of the riemann zeta function according to eq. (3.13).
after that the photon mass can be put to zero. in order to obtain the required analytic

(3.19)

from eq. (3.19) it follows that the series (3.18) converges when re s < 1. but it is not
dangerous now because we have replaced the sum in eq. (3.6) in terms of the riemann zeta
function (s  1) which is dened everywhere except for the point s = 2.
finally eqs. (3.4), (3.9), (3.12), (3.15), (3.16), and (3.18) dene the spectral zeta func-
tion  d
cyl(s) as an analytic function of the complex variable s in the region . here it is
worth noting that the analytic continuation does not ensure that in the region , we are
interested in, the spectral zeta function cyl(s) is free of singularities. really eqs. (3.13)
and (3.14) used for analytic continuation contain the riemann zeta function (s) and the
euler gamma function (s) having singularities (poles) at certain isolated points. therefore,
 d
cyl(s) considered in  may also possess the singularities of the same type.12 as the analytic
continuation is unique the removal of these divergences is obviously impossible. this mani-
fests the inability of the present approach to remove the divergences in all the cases. if the
considered quantity is expressed via the value of the spectral zeta function at its singularity
point then the zeta function technique does not give a nite answer.9

in order to obtain the casimir energy of the massless scalar eld obeying the dirichlet
boundary conditions on an innite cylinder of radius a let us calculate, according to (2.7),
the spectral zeta function  d
cyl(s) at the point s = 1. numerical integration in (3.12) yields

(3.27)
can be considered instead of the function z3(s) dened by (3.8). the formula (3.27) reduces
to (3.8) after substituting the logarithm by its uniform asymptotic expansion (3.3). it is
easy to show that z3(s) is an analytic function of s when 3 < re s < 1. it means that
z3(s), as well as z3(s), does not need analytic continuation. in practice eq. (3.27) is used
for several rst values of n, n  n0, and for n > n0 one applies (3.8). the reason is that the
uniform asymptotic expansion does not provide sucient accuracy when n < n0 = 6  10.
evaluating z3(1) according to this algorithm with n0 = 6 we obtain an improved value

the zeta function technique does not lead to a nite answer for the casimir energy
in the plane problem considered here (two space-like dimensions), as well as in all the
cases of arbitrary even space dimensions.13 as usual the coecients in front of the pole-like
contributions, calculated by dierent methods coincide, but the nite parts of the answers
dier.7,14 in this respect our consideration has a certain advantage, because when calculating
the casimir energy of the elds on a plane we employ eq. (4.1). thereby we in fact make
use of the spectral zeta function cyl(s) for a cylinder which has already been normalized
by a nite answer for the casimir energy of an innite cylinder.

of course the problem of the casimir energy calculation in the even dimensional spaces
is far from being completely solved. to obtain an acceptable nite answer for this energy
one should invoke some additional physical arguments providing the removal of the pole-like
contributions from eqs. (4.9), (4.17), and (4.18) or use new mathematical methods which
will not result in such divergent terms.

v. conclusion

in the present paper the explicit expressions are derived which dene the spectral zeta
functions for an innite cylinder cyl(s) in a nite range of complex variable s containing
the segment of real axis 1  re s  0. it enables one to nd the spectral zeta function
for a circle making use of the zeta function for an innite cylinder according to the relation
(2.6). in ref. 8 this relation was applied directly, i.e., for constructing cyl(s) from cir(s).
however, to obtain the value of cyl(s) at the point s = 1, the authors of this paper have
to make additional analytic continuation of the function cir(s) from the neighborhood of
the point s = 1 to the point s = 2.
in our consideration, as well as in treatment of the analogous problems by other authors,
the central part was played by the uniform asymptotic expansion for the product of the
bessel functions. the lack of such expansions for the eigenfunctions in problems with other
geometry of the boundaries (for example, with boundary conditions dened on the surface
of a spheroid) does not permit to expand directly this approach beyond the systems with
spherical symmetry.
