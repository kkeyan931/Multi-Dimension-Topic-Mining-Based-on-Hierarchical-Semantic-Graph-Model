the hypothesis that the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking is due to interactions
of massless fermions in their lowest landau level is examined in the context of chirally symmetric
models with short ranged interactions. it is argued that, when the magnetic eld is suciently large,
even an innitesimal attractive interaction in the appropriate channel will break chiral symmetry.

i. introduction

field theoretical models in external electromagnetic elds are of great interest and have attracted a lot of attention
[14]. they are relevant to the study of many physical systems whose properties depend on the eects produced by
external elds, especially when such eects are non-perturbative in nature. a particular example of such a situation
is the so-called magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking [510] (see also [1113] for some earlier studies) which
has many potential applications in condensed matter physics [1416] and in studies of the early universe [17].

it is well known that a suciently strong attractive interaction between massless fermions can result in a chiral
symmetry breaking condensate and a dynamically generated fermion mass. in the nambu-jona-lasinio (njl) model,
for example, this occurs when the interaction strength is at a particular large critical value. it is also now known
that the presence of an external magnetic eld can be a strong catalyst for this eect, leading in some cases to the
generation of a dynamical mass for fermions even by very weak attractive interactions. for example, in an external
magnetic eld, the critical value of the njl coupling is reduced to zero.

it was suggested in [5] that this magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking is a rather universal phenomenon
and that its main features are model independent. the arguments were based on the observation that the eect is
primarily due to the dynamics of the fermions from the lowest landau level which are gapless and should therefore
dominate the behavior of the system at long wavelengths.

in this paper we will develop this idea further. we shall investigate the low-energy dynamics of chirally symmetric
models with a short range interaction in an external magnetic eld. the idea is to construct an eective action
for the low energy degrees of freedom. in strong external magnetic elds, these are the modes of charged particles
in the lowest landau level.
in the absence of interactions, their eective dynamics is described by a eld theory
whose dimensionality is two less than the spacetime dimension. we shall take the hypothesis that, at least for strong
magnetic elds and short ranged interactions, the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking can be understood in the
lower dimensional eective theory.

as an illustration, we shall argue that this assumption is very natural in 2+1 dimensions. there, the modes of the
lowest landau level are non-propagating, and in the absence of interactions, the ground state is highly degenerate
and contains both chirally symmetric and chirally non-symmetric states. interactions, even with innitesimally small
coupling constants, will split this degeneracy, and whether chiral symmetry breaking occurs or not depends on whether
the interaction favors the chirally non-symmetric or chirally symmetric ground states. one by-product of our analysis
will be the fact that the dynamical generation of parity violating masses seems to be suppressed by magnetic elds.
in the more complicated case of (3+1)-dimensional gauge theory, we shall argue that the infrared dynamics is
governed by an eective (1+1)-dimensional gross-neveu like theory with an innite number of avors of fermions.
we derive the most general low energy eective action which is compatible with the symmetries of the four dimensional
theory. we then study the resulting model using the renormalization group. we will present a plausible argument

for our main conclusion: that the presence of chiral symmetry breaking depends crucially on the sign (but not the
magnitude) of one particular moment of the coupling constants which we denote by gv. if it is of the appropriate
sign, its infrared renormalization group ow is to strong coupling and chiral symmetry is broken. with the other sign
it ows to zero coupling and chiral symmetry remains unbroken.

ii. (2+1)-dimensional paradigm

consider a system of relativistic (2+1)-dimensional fermions with the dirac hamiltonian

h0 =(cid:18) i~  ~d

0

0

i~  ~d(cid:19) ,

(1)

where ~d = ~ + ie ~a(~x) is the covariant derivative and ~ = (1, 2) are the rst two pauli matrices. this hamiltonian
is obtained in the continuum limit of some tight-binding lattice models relevant to condensed matter physics  on a
square lattice with half of a quantum of magnetic ux through each plaquette (see [18] and references therein) or on
a honeycomb lattice without a magnetic eld [19].it has also been discussed in the context of the continuum limit of
the d-wave state of high tc superconductors [14,15].

h0 commutes with any linear combination of the matrices

a. symmetries

i =(cid:18) 1 0

0 1(cid:19) , t 1 =(cid:18) 0

3

3

0 (cid:19) , t 2 =(cid:18) 0 i3

0 (cid:19) , t 3 =(cid:18) 1

i3

0

0 1(cid:19) ,

(2)

which generate the lie algebra of a u (2) avor symmetry which we will call chiral symmetry. possible mass terms
which can be added to h0 must be matrices which anti-commute with it. the basic matrix which anti-commutes
with h0 and which commutes with all of the avor generators is

 =(cid:18) 3

0

0

3(cid:19)

(3)

and a mass term which one could add to h0 which would preserve the avor symmetry is m.

generally, in 2+1 dimensions, fermion mass terms violate parity symmetry. a parity transformation which is a

symmetry of the massless dirac equation

and which commutes with the avor symmetry generators t a is

h0e(x) = ee(x)

e(x1, x2) (cid:18) 2

0 2(cid:19) e(x1, x2).

0

(4)

(5)

the mass term m is odd under this transformation and it would therefore violate parity symmetry. more generally,

all mass terms of the form (cid:16)m0i + ~m  ~t(cid:17) are odd under the parity dened in eq. (5). moreover, there is no

modication of the parity transformation which would make the mass m parity symmetric.

it is possible to get a parity invariant mass by breaking the avor symmetry. for this, we must dene parity as a

combination of the transformation (5) and a discrete avor transformation, for example,

e(x1, x2) (cid:18) 2

0 2(cid:19) t 1e(x1, x2).

0

(6)

this is a symmetry of h0 and it also commutes with the mass term (cid:0)m2t 2 + m3t 3(cid:1). this mass term breaks the
u (2) avor symmetry to u (1)  u (1).

2

b. zero modes

this existence of the unitary matrix  which anti-commutes with h0 implies that h0 has a symmetric spectrum:
if he = ee, then he = ee and, with a particular choice of phase, e = e. thus, for each positive
energy state, there is a negative energy state and the probability measure 
e(x)e(x) is a symmetric function of e.
the interesting feature of h0 is the appearance of zero energy states in a background magnetic eld. consider the

equation

where the background electromagnetic eld is static and has the property ~  ~a = b(x). it has the solution

~  ~du0 = 0,

where

and

u0(x) = exp(cid:2)ie(x)  e3(x)(cid:3) v(x),

 ~2(x) = ~  ~a(x), ~2(x) = ~  ~a(x) = b(x)

the second equation in eqs. (9) has the solution

~  ~v(x) = 0.

with asymptotic behavior

(x) = 

1

2 z d2y ln|x  y|b(y),

lim

|x|

(x) = 


e

ln|x|,  =

e

2 z d2yb(y).

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(this is strictly correct if the magnetic eld goes to zero suciently quickly at innity for the total ux  to be nite.
if it is not nite, there is an innite number of zero modes and their density is given by /v where v is the volume.)
asymptotically,

lim

|~x|

u0(x) = |~x|3

v(x).

(13)

in order to have a normalizable zero mode, the spinor v(x) should be an eigenvector of 3 with eigenvalue sgn()
(1 if  > 0 and +1 if  < 0). it then must be a normalizable solution of the equations
x2(cid:19) v(x) = 0.

(cid:18) 
x1 + isgn()
solutions of this equation are v(x) (cid:2)x1  isgn()x2(cid:3)k
for k = 0, 1, . . . , [||]  1 where [||] is the largest integer less
than || and the maximum value of k is the largest power allowed by normalizability of the wave function. thus there
are [||] normalizable zero modes. this fact depends only on the total magnetic ux and is independent of the prole
of the magnetic eld. the result, which we have found by explicit computation, is also a result of the atiyah-singer
index theorem generalized to open spaces [20]. some other applications of this idea are discussed in [21].

(14)

3v(x) = sgn()v(x),



there are thus 2[||] zero mode wave functions of h0. all of them obey the equation

[||] of them obey the equation

and [||] of them obey

0 = sgn()0,

t 30 = sgn()0,

t 30 = sgn()0.

(15)

(16)

(17)

of course, any linear combination of them is also a zero mode and could be chosen to be eigenvalues of any of the
avor symmetry breaking mass operators  ~m  ~t . all linear combinations would satisfy eq. (15).

3

c. interpretation

the existence of zero modes implies that the dirac ground state of the second quantized system of fermions is
degenerate.
in the ground state, all negative energy states of the fermions are full and all positive energy states
are empty. for overall charge neutrality, half of the fermion zero modes must be occupied  but the occupation of
zero modes is otherwise unconstrained.1 this means that the degeneracy of the ground state is n0!/[(n0/2)!]2 where
n0 = [||] is the number of zero mode wave-functions.
normal ordering, is [20]

in second quantization, the expectation value of any fermion bilinear operator, using the dirac commutator for

(cid:28)z d2x : (x)m (x) :(cid:29) = 

1

2
 xoccupiedz d2x

e(x)m e(x)  xunoccupiedz d2x

e(x)m e(x)
 .

(18)

since, in the dirac ground state, all positive energy states are unoccupied and negative energy states are occupied,
and since  maps positive energy states onto negative energy states, if the matrix m commutes with , only the zero
modes survive in this summation.

first of all, this means that in a magnetic eld the expectation value of the parity violating mass operator vanishes,

(cid:28)z d2x :  :(cid:29) =(cid:28)z d2x :  :(cid:29) = 0,

(19)

regardless of the occupation of zero modes. this has the implication that external magnetic elds do not enhance the
generation of parity violating mass terms. in fact, it indicates that if the external eld is strong enough that the zero

modes are well isolated, the expectation value of a parity breaking mass operator, hr :  :i should always vanish.

on the other hand, the parity invariant, chiral symmetry breaking mass (with m = t 3) has the expectation value

(cid:28)z d2x : (x)t 3(x) :(cid:29) = 

1
2

sgn()

 xoccupiedz d2x

0(x)t 30(x)  xunoccupiedz d2x

0(x)t 30(x)
 .

it is possible to choose ground states where this expectation value has any value between two bounds:

 [||] (cid:28)z d2x : (x)t 3(x) :(cid:29)  [||].

(20)

(21)

if we added an innitesimal mass term mt 3 to the hamiltonian h0, the system would choose the ground state with
minimal t 3, that is the one where2

(cid:28)z d2x : (x)t 3(x) :(cid:29) = [||]sgn(m).

(22)

the observation that this is so for innitesimal mass was made in [5]. however, this does not mean that chiral
symmetry is necessarily broken.
it only implies that the ground state is degenerate and there are chirally non-
symmetric ground states which are degenerate with chirally symmetric ones. if there are additional weak interactions,
of course, the correct ground state should be found by resolving the degeneracy using degenerate perturbation theory.
in this case, all that is required to break chiral symmetry is an interaction which favors a chirally non-symmetric
population of the zero modes.

1of course, occupying half of the zero modes is only possible when their number is even, which we shall assume. if it is odd,
there are no neutral ground states.
2this is just the contribution of zero modes. if the total magnetic ux  is nite, the dirac hamiltonian has a continuum
spectrum whose support begins at zero energy. furthermore, there is a threshold density of continuum states whose contribution
to bilinear densities such as eq. (22) makes up the dierence between [||] and || which is proportional to the spectral
asymmetry of the hamiltonian and is the correct result. for details, see [20]. in the present paper, for simplicity we ignore
the relatively small error which we make in neglecting the asymmetry of the continuum spectrum. when the magnetic ux is
innite, for example in the case of constant external eld, [||] should be replaced by |eb|v /2 where v is the spatial volume.

4

if the interaction favors the breaking of chiral symmetry, symmetry breaking occurs for even an innitesimal value
of its coupling constant. this is the reason why the critical value of the interaction can be at zero coupling in the
presence of a magnetic eld. in fact, in the absence of external magnetic elds a critical coupling necessary to break
chiral symmetry is typically large. in the presence of the magnetic eld it is reduced to zero.

for example, it is well known that an interaction of the njl model,

lint =

,

(23)

when added to the hamiltonian will break the chiral symmetry if the coupling constant is attractive and is greater
than a particular critical value. this is seen by analyzing solutions of the schwinger-dyson equation for a mass
condensate. it was shown in [5] that, in the presence of a magnetic eld, the critical coupling moves from some nite
value to zero  even an innitesimal coupling will break the chiral symmetry. that observation is consistent with
our nding here.

an interesting test of this idea would be to examine the eect on system with the interaction



2 (cid:0) t 3(cid:1)2



2 (cid:0) (cid:1)2

lint =

,

(24)

which can break parity by generating a parity violating fermion mass if  has the appropriate sign and is of large
enough magnitude [18]. our analysis seems to suggest that a large magnetic eld should in fact tend to increase the
magnitude of the critical coupling.

iii. strategy in d=3+1

in 3+1 dimensions, the situation is more complicated. the zero modes of the dirac hamiltonian in a background

magnetic eld still have some dynamics which is non-trivial and there are more possibilities for interactions.

to understand the general strategy that we will take, begin with the lagrangian which describes dirac fermions

interacting with an external electromagnetic eld,

where d =  + iea(x). for concreteness, we choose the chiral representation of the dirac matrices,

s0 =z d4xi d,

and we shall use the notation

the lagrangian has the form

0 (cid:19) ,
0 =(cid:18) 0 i

i = i(cid:18) 0

r(cid:16)d0  ~  ~d(cid:17) ri .

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

this action has a global u (1)l  u (1)r chiral symmetry. in the following, we must keep in mind that when there
are both background electric and magnetic elds, or if the gauge eld is dynamical, this symmetry is reduced to the
vector u (1) by the axial anomaly. for simplicity, in this paper we will assume that this is not the case. it would
be straightforward to extend the present work to models with dynamical u (1) elds, by introducing more species of
fermions so that there exist chiral symmetries which are unaected by the axial anomaly. for now, we will consider
the case of a constant non-dynamical background magnetic eld,

in this background eld, it is convenient to make use of the mixed spacetime-momentum representation as follows:

a0 = 0, ai =

(cid:0)k3  d(cid:1) (z, z) = (z, z)

 = pk2 + 2n|eb|,

for all integers n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . when n  1, these are dispersion relations of (1+1)-dimensional dirac fermions with
masses given by p2n|eb|. [of course, this mass gap is not lorentz invariant from a four-dimensional point of view.
however, it is lorentz invariant in 1+1 dimensions. the reason for this is that there is a subgroup of the lorentz
group which survives in the background magnetic eld  it is invariant under boosts in the direction of the eld
lines. here this will mean that the eective theory for landau levels must be invariant under the (1+1)-dimensional
lorentz transformations.]

(30)

(31)

(33)

zero modes of d are solutions of the equation

(34)

(35)

with m = 0, 1, 2, . . . . here, without loss of generality, we assumed that eb > 0. in the (1+1)-dimensional theory, the
zero modes of d correspond to massless fermions. the lagrangian is (restoring the space dependence)

s0 =z dx0dx3

m (x0, x3)m(z, z) +x(massive modes).

(r)

(37)

(38)

note that the kinetic term in the action (36) for the massless modes appears to have a u (n )r  u (n )l with
n   symmetry. this is just the unitary symmetry which mixes the dierent wave functions of the degenerate zero
modes, and which is actually there for every landau level. this eective symmetry is not preserved by interactions.
we will analyze the possibility that interactions that are added to this eld theory drive a spontaneous breaking
of the u (1)r  u (1)l chiral symmetry by generating a mass gap for the fermions in eq. (36). we expect that this
spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place at very long wavelengths. our approach to the problem in the following
sections can be summarized as follows:

1. we consider the theory of four-dimensional fermions in a magnetic eld as described above, with some inter-
actions which should be local and respect (3+1)-dimensional poincare and chiral symmetry but are otherwise
unspecied.

2. we then consider the eective eld theory which is obtained by integrating out all of the massive modes of the

fermions in eq. (36) and momentum states of the massless modes above an ultraviolet cuto.

6

3. we assume that the resulting eective lagrangian is local. to guarantee locality, we generally have to assume
that the interactions between fermions in four dimensions are short ranged.3 furthermore, the ultraviolet cuto
for the eective theory should be less than the mass gap of the lightest massive mode, |eb|.

4. we consider all relevant operators which could be added to the eective lagrangian which are consistent with
the symmetries of the theory. since they should be relevant in the sense of two dimensional eld theory, these
are all possible four-fermion operators which are consistent with symmetry. there are an innite number of
such operators.

5. we compute the beta function for the coupling constants of the relevant operators and look for infrared stable
xed points. these xed points should govern the behavior of the very long-wavelength degrees of freedom of
the theory.

6. if the coupling constants ow to an infrared stable xed point, then an infrared limit of the massless theory
exists and there is no symmetry breaking. if, on the other hand, the coupling constant ow is not in the domain
of attraction of any infrared xed point, so that it ows to strong coupling in the infrared, we postulate that
this implies the dynamical generation of a mass gap  and spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. we shall
nd examples of both kinds of behavior.

an example of a local four dimensional interaction which preserves the u (1)r  u (1)l chiral symmetry is the njl

interaction [22],

a renormalizable version of this interaction would be one which is mediated by a massive scalar mesons.

iv. general structure of the low-energy theory

the constraints of (1+1)-dimensional lorentz invariance and u (1)r  u (1)l chiral symmetry allow four-fermion

coupling constants as in the eective theory,

(40)

the coupling constants g0(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) obey further constraints from charge conjugation, parity and time reversal

(cpt) symmetry and the symmetry of the underlying theory under translations and rotations about the axis of the
magnetic eld which are summarized in appendix a. a general solution of those constraints would yield the most
general allowed structure of the low-energy eective action in eq. (40).

some particular solutions of those constraints are of interest. for example, the constraints allow the maximally

symmetric solution with u (n )r  u (n )l (n  ) symmetry,

g(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) = glrn1,m2n2,m1,

where glr is real. similarly, there is a solution with u (n )v (with n  ) symmetry,

g(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) = gv n1,n2m1,m2 ,

where gv is real again.

(41)

(42)

3if there are long-ranged interactions which are mediated by massless elds, the correct procedure would be to retain the long
wavelength modes of the massless elds in the eective lagrangian.

7

in addition a large class of solutions could be found by the reduction of the interactions in the original (3+1)-

dimensional model to the lowest landau level. after such a reduction of the njl interaction (39), we arrive at

g(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) =

g

2(n1+m1+n2+m2)/2s

(n1 + m1 + 1)(n2 + m2 + 1)

(n1 + 1)(m1 + 1)(n2 + 1)(m2 + 1)

.

(43)

since it descends from a lorentz and chirally invariant interaction in 3+1 dimensions, it must necessarily satisfy the
constraints of symmetry [see eqs. (a6), (a7), (a10), (a11) and (a12)]. unlike the rst two solutions in eqs. (41) and
(42), this last one in eq. (43) does not seem to have any extra symmetry in addition to the required u (1)r  u (1)l
avor symmetry.
now, we envisage having obtained the eective action (40) by integrating out all modes in the higher landau levels,
as well as all momentum modes of the fermions in the lowest landau level which are above a certain cuto. of
the many interactions that this procedure would produce, we have kept only the local four-fermion operators. this
procedure is legitimate only if the ultraviolet cuto of this model is lower than the lowest mass gap of the elds which
have been eliminated, i.e. |eb|. by chiral symmetry and lorentz invariance, the eective action cannot contain mass
terms for the fermions. furthermore, the only lorentz invariant four-fermion operator is of the form given in eq. (40).
the renormalization group procedure examines how the coupling constants in eq. (40) change as we further lower

the cuto to isolate the very long wavelength excitations. this information is encoded in the beta function.

the  function for the general coupling constant in eq. (40) is computed in 2 +  dimensions to two loop order in

appendix b. the result is

finally, before we proceed to the next section, we note that we may have to occasionally cut o the summation over
modes in the rst landau level. we do this by summing modes up to some maximum number, n = 0, 1, . . . , n . such
a situation could be produced by considering the fermions in an external magnetic eld with nite magnetic ux, or
with uniform eld and nite transverse area. in that case, n which can be thought of as the number of avors
which goes to innity as |eb|s12/2 where s12   is the area of the two-dimensional perpendicular (with respect
to the direction of the magnetic eld) subspace.

v. symmetric fixed points

in appendix b, we have computed the two-loop  function (44) for the most general coupling constants, subject to
the restriction in eq. (a12). the next natural step would be locate infrared stable xed points of this beta function.
this problem is far more complicated than we can solve at present. instead, in our analysis below, we shall restrict
our attention to the beta function for coupling constants with close to maximal symmetry.

for some scalar eld theories, where there are many components of a scalar eld and renormalizable interactions
which couple them, it is known that the only infrared xed points of the renormalization group ow of relevant
couplings are those with maximal symmetry [23,24]. to our knowledge, there is no similar theorem for gross-neveu
like models. on the other hand, we consider it plausible that similar arguments can be applied: in particular, if no
maximally symmetric infrared stable xed point exists, then there are no infrared stable xed points at all.

8

maximally symmetric couplings can easily be shown to be contained in other combinations of coupling constants.

in appendix c we show that the njl coupling contains the maximally symmetric ones.

consider the renormalization group ow in the special case when u (n )r u (n )l and u (n )v couplings, as dened
in eqs. (41) and (42), are the only non-zero couplings in the eective action. then, from our general result in the
previous section, we extract the following expressions for the  functions of interest:

lr = 2glr +

(46)

note that we have been forced to introduce a cuto on n . in order to get a sensible result when taking the limit

n  , it is convenient to rescale the couplings as follows: glr  glr/n and gv  gv/n . as is clear from the
denition, the  functions will also get rescaled accordingly, lr  lr/n and v  v/n . after taking this into
account and performing the limit n  , we arrive at
lr = 2glr +

(48)
it must be emphasized that we have adopted the rescaling of the most symmetric glr coupling by 1/n rather than
1/n . since the rescaling performed above led to the well-dened  functions, we conclude that the (1+1)-dimensional
action in eq. (40) with glr of order  1/n describes a consistent and non-trivial interacting theory in the limit

reads

this ow is presented graphically in fig. 1 where the arrows show the ow direction toward ultraviolet.

in the upper half-plane gv > 0, the simple analysis of the ow given by eqs. (51) and (52) reveals infrared (with

respectively. we argue that the strong infrared dynamics (with gv  +) in this half-plane of couplings is an
indication of a mass generation and breaking of the chiral u (1) symmetry. indeed, the generation of the fermion mass
in the infrared region seems to be the only way one can avoid running into the problem of the physical landau pole.

4as one can see, the rescaling of glr by 1/n is also meaningful. the resulting  functions are

lr = 2glr,

v = 2gv

(49)

(50)

the corresponding theory is less interesting. indeed, the expressions for the  functions in eq. (49) and (50) in the limit  = 0
describe the situation when the glr coupling does not run at all, while the gv experiences asymptotic freedom from the gv > 0
side and infrared freedom from the gv < 0 side. we shall see in a moment that this picture corresponds to a special case
(glr = 0) of the ow described by eqs. (47) and (48).

9

the generation of the fermion mass in the gv > 0 half-plane, in its turn, is consistent with the expectation of the
universality of the magnetic catalysis in a wide range of (3+1)-dimensional models (such as the njl) with a short
range interaction. indeed, as we established, the low energy dynamics in such models is described by the (1+1)-
dimensional eective action in eq. (40) with the coupling satisfying the set of restriction in eqs. (a10), (a11) and
(a12). the generic coupling [say, like that in eq. (43) coming from the interaction of the lowest landau level modes]
which does not have any extra symmetry is still expected to have the u (n )r  u (n )l and u (n )v contribution [see
eqs. (c7a) and (c7b)]. then, if this u (n )v contribution is positive, gv > 0, it is going to drive the system to the
generation of mass.

now let us study the ow in the lower half-plane gv  0. as is easy to see, there is an infrared xed point at
(glr, gv) = (0, 0) and the ultraviolet landau pole (with gv   while glr is either xed or approaches ) at the
following values of t:

tuv =(cid:18) 2

(55)

(56)

since the infrared xed point (0, 0) corresponds to weakly coupled dynamics, there is apparently no mass generation
in this half-plane of the coupling space. this is also in full agreement with our general expectation. indeed, the
negative values of gv correspond to the repulsion rather than attraction in the fermion-antifermion channel which is
responsible for the generation of mass, breaking chiral u (1) symmetry.

our conclusion here is that whether this model breaks chiral symmetry or not is entirely dependent on the sign of

the coupling constant gv.

the reader might be puzzled by the fact that a u (1) chiral symmetry can be broken in an eectively two dimensional
system. we emphasize here that this phenomenon is identical to that in the chiral gross-neveu model. strictly
speaking, chiral symmetry can only be broken in the large n limit. the nite n system should still be chirally
symmetric, as the low dimensionality of the system would not allow for spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry.
indeed, if we consider the case of a large but nite value of n , an infrared stable xed point appears for gv > 0 at
(glr, gv)  (2, n ) which goes to innity with n  . this xed point is at strong coupling, so a conclusion
based on perturbation theory is speculative at best, but its appearance is consistent with the expectation that the
massless limit of this model is well dened (albeit strongly coupled) when gv > 0 and n is nite and chiral symmetry
breaking need not take place. when n   this xed point moves to innite coupling and chiral symmetry breaking
is possible.

vi. conclusion

in this paper we have shown that the eective low-energy dynamics of the u (1) chirally symmetric models with a
short range interaction in a background magnetic eld is described by a (1+1)-dimensional gross-neveu like model
with an innite number of avors [see eq. (40)]. here we established that dierent avors come out as the represen-
tation space of the magnetic translations in the original (3+1)-dimensional model. the number of avors is innite
and proportional to the area of the two dimensional space perpendicular to the magnetic eld.

based exclusively on the arguments of symmetry, we established a set of conditions, given by eqs. (a6), (a7), (a10),
(a11) and (a12), that the couplings of the eective theory have to satisfy. to show that they allow a non-trivial
solution, we presented a few (out of innitely many possible) examples of couplings that satisfy all the constrains.
among them, there are, in particular, the highly symmetric u (n )r  u (n )l and u (n )v (with n  ) couplings.
these latter are of special interest because their renormalization group ow is self-contained and allows an analytical
solution [see eqs. (51) and (52)].

at the level of the eective theory, we calculated the two-loop  function and analyzed the renormalization group
ow in the two-dimensional subspace of the u (n )r  u (n )l and u (n )v couplings. the general result is argued to
indicate the generation of the fermion mass in the gv > 0 half-plane of couplings. in the other half-plane, the infrared
dynamics is weakly coupled and there is no mass generation. this mass generation pattern is consistent with the
earlier suggested conjecture of the universality of the so-called magnetic catalysis [5] in, at least, the models from the
same universality class as the chiral u (1) njl model.

appendix a: constraints on coupling constants

let us clarify the origin of the action as well as the meaning of dierent avors in eq. (40) in terms of the original

(3+1)-dimensional model dened in eqs. (28) and (39).

we start from the analysis of the space-time symmetries in the model. notice that, due to the presence of the
background eld, the standard translations in the two-dimensional plane perpendicular to the magnetic eld are not
symmetries of the original model in eq. (28). nevertheless, there are other transformations, the so-called magnetic
translations, which leave the action invariant. in contrast to the case of the ordinary translations, the two generators
of the magnetic translations do not commute. in the symmetric gauge given in eq. (29), the explicit representation
of the generators and their commutation relation read

x = eb(cid:18)x1 + i
y = eb(cid:18)x2  i

[x, y ] = i,

d2

eb(cid:19) ,
eb(cid:19) ,

(a1a)

(a1b)

where we assume that eb > 0. it is easy to check that the operators x and y commute with the hamiltonian of our
model. instead of these x and y , it is convenient to introduce the creation and annihilation operators

having introduced these operators in the problem, we realize that the fock space is spanned by the set of states |q, mi
where the quantum number m = 0, 1, 2, . . . denotes the eigenvalue of aa operator and the multi-index q represents
all the other quantum numbers (say, the landau level number, the fermion spin projection and the chirality). in the
absence of any vacuum rearrangement (symmetry breaking), the above set of states (in coordinate representation)
reads

where l = 1/eb is the magnetic length, z = x1 + ix2, z = x1  ix2, xkpk = x0p0  x3p3 and , is the spinor with

a given spin projection  and chirality . note that the expression in eq. (a3) is well dened even for the case when
m < n (both numbers are positive) due to the rodrigues formula for the generalized laguerre polynomials,

one has to remember also that all the modes in the lowest landau level (n = 0) have the same projection of the spin,
while the modes in the higher landau levels (n  1) have both projections.
since we are interested in the structure of the eective action, describing the infrared dynamics (p0  eb), it
is sucient to take into account only those degrees of freedom that originate from the lowest landau level modes
(n = 0). these modes freely propagate in the (1+1)-dimensional parallel (x0, x3) subspace, and are classied by
the chirality and the eigenvalue of aa [see eq. (a3)]. in what follows, we denote the eective degrees of freedom
accordingly, (l,r)
m (xk), where the superscript (l) or (r) denotes the states that result from the (3+1)-dimensional

. after performing the integration over the perpendicular space coordinates in the original
njl action, we arrive at the eective model as in eq. (40). remarkably, while the njl coupling g is dimensionful,
the eective coupling in eq. (40) is dimensionless, g  g/l2  g|eb|.
from the derivation above, we see that the elds of dierent avors in the eective (1+1)-dimensional theory (40)
correspond to dierent eigenstates of aa operator. this simple observation, as we show below, has far reaching
consequences.

now, let us establish the allowed structure of coupling constants in eq. (40). the most general restriction on the

couplings comes from the condition of reality of the action. this requires that

similarly, the invariance under the parity (x3  x3) leads to another restriction:

g(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) = g(cid:18) m2 m1

n2 n1 (cid:19) .

g(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) = g(cid:18) m1 m2

n1 n2 (cid:19) .

(a6)

(a7)

these two conditions are too general and so are not of great interest or of great power by themselves. it turns out,
however, that there are other, more restrictive conditions.

by recalling the origin of avors in eq. (40), we realize that the eective theory should enjoy some kind of avor
symmetry that results from the symmetry under magnetic translations of the original (3+1)-dimensional theory. this
avor symmetry, as will become clear in a moment, puts further restrictions on the allowed structure of the four-index
coupling in eq. (40).

the innitesimal transformations of the magnetic translations and the related rotation in the perpendicular plane

are given by the following operators:

u1 = 1 + i1x  1 +
u2 = 1 + i2y  1 +
u12 = 1 + i12aa.

i12(cid:0)a + a(cid:1) ,
22(cid:0)a  a(cid:1) ,

(a8a)

(a8b)

(a8c)

to determine the transformation properties of the elds of dierent avors, we again recall that, by construction,
these elds are the eigenstates of the aa operator. then, by doing a simple exercise, we nd that the action of the
creation and annihilation operators, a and a, on the properly normalized elds should read

an = n + 1n+1,

an = nn1.

(a9)

making use of these properties, we check that the kinetic term in the eective action is invariant under the transfor-
mations in eqs. (a8a), (a8b) and (a8c). in fact, if we had started with a more general, non-diagonal kinetic term
in the eective action [which is not forbidden by the chiral u (1) symmetry], the requirement of invariance under the
magnetic translations would lead us back to the diagonal form as in eq. (40).

the invariance of the four-fermion interaction g in eq. (40) under the set of transformations in eqs. (a8a), (a8b)

and (a8c) leads to

appendix b: calculation of the two-loop -function

to derive the two-loop  function of the eective spinor theory in eq. (40), we apply the method of ref. [24] that
was used for the 4 scalar theory in d = 4   dimensions. in dimensional regularization (with d = 2 + 2), our
renormalized lagrangian density reads

where the coupling g includes the coupling constant renormalization, g = zgg, and the ellipsis denotes the coun-
terterms. we remind the reader that the four-index coupling g is non-zero only for n1  n2 + m1  m2 = 0. this
means that the four-fermion term in eq. (b1) contains the sum only over three indices (say, n1, n2, and m1), while
the fourth one (m2) is superuous.

before proceeding with the actual calculation of the  function, we need to specify how to handle the infrared
divergences that appear in the calculation of the feynman diagrams [24,25]. such divergences usually come from the
propagators of the massless fermions. if treated improperly, they could easily obscure the calculation of the relevant
diagrams and eventually lead to a wrong result. to avoid the problem, in what follows, we modify the infrared region
by changing the fermion propagators as follows:

s(l)(p) =

s(r)(p) =

p
p2 
p+
p2 

p

p2  m2 ,
p2  m2 .

(b2a)

(b2b)

this infrared regularization procedure respects all the symmetries of the model and does not change the ultraviolet
region.

now, let us calculate the  function. first of all, we recall that the relation between the bare and the renormalized

couplings, in the dimensional regularization (d = 2 + 2), reads

g0(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) =

m2

g(cid:18) n1 n2

m1 m2 (cid:19) .

this is going to be used in the denition of the  function. in calculation, we impose the following renormalization
conditions:

(2r)

n n (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p=0

= g(cid:18) n1 n2
m1 m2 (cid:19) .

(b4)

(b5)

note that the introduction of the eective infrared cuto m in the fermion propagators earlier allows us to use the
renormalization point at p = 0.

the feynman diagrams of the relevant contributions to the two-point functions at two-loop order are given in
figs. 2a and 2b. by extracting the divergent (of order 1/) terms of these two-loop corrections, we arrive at the
equations

0 = b0 = 2d0 which, by the way, is the necessary condition for the renor-
malizability of the model. note that the last term in eq. (b18) appears due to the renormalization of the two-point
function. after taking into account the values of constants in eqs. (b15a)  (b15d), we arrive at our nal result for
