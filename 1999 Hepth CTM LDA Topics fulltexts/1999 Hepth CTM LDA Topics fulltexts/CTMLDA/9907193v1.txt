abstract

in this note we present an application of the schwarzian derivative.
by exploiting some properties of the schwarzian derivative, we solve the
equation appearing in the gravity-dilaton-antisymmetric tensor system.
we also mention that this method can also be used to solve some other
equations.

the schwarzian derivative appears naturally in the transformation law of

the two-dimensional stress-energy tensor [1]:

(zz)2 t (z) = t (z) 

c
12 {z, z},

where {z, z} denotes the schwarzian derivative:
g (cid:19)2
2(cid:18) g 

g (cid:19)
s(g) (cid:18) g

.

(2)

it comes as a surprise that it also appears in a dierential equation which we
obtained during the course of solving the equations of motion of the coupled

talk given by b. zhou at the ccast workshop on integrable system, beijing, may

47.

system of gravity-dilaton-antisymmetric tensor system. the last equation to
be solved [2, 3] is:

y  


2

(y )2 + q(r)y  = r(r),

(3)

where q(r) and r(r) are two specic functions of r (see [3] for exact formulas)
and  is a (non-vanishing) constant.

to solve this equation completely, we follows [2, 3]. let

1

y =

g =z d r ey r q(r)dr,
(cid:18)ln(g ) +z q(r)dr(cid:19) ,
g (cid:19)
(cid:18) g 

g (cid:19)2

= r(r).

or,

(8)

the left-hand side of eq. (6) is the schwarzian derivative of the function g
as we dened in (2). thus, in order to solve eq. (6), one must nd a function
g such that

.

(9)

s(g) = 

d2  1

r2 d2

(c2 + c1r2 d)2

we will do this in the following sections [2, 3].

1 notations and conventions

let f be an arbitrary function of r and f  be its derivative. the notation f (r)
always represents the value of the function f at r. similarly, f (r) is the value
of the function f  at r.

2

for two functions f and g, f g is their product1, and

is their division,
while the composition of two functions f and g is denoted by f  g. these
functions are dened by

f
g

(f g)(r) = f (r)g(r),

(cid:18) f
g(cid:19) (r) =
(f  g)(r) = f (g(r)).

f (r)
g(r)

,

(10)

(11)

(12)

for product of three or more functions we assume that the composition of
two functions has a higher rank of precedence of associavity than the products

of functions. nevertheless the symbol

f
g

is considered to be a pure entity

and cant be broken. to understand these conventions we have the following
examples:

f g  h = g  h f = f (g  h),
g  h =(cid:18) f
f
.

g(cid:19)  h =

f  h
g  h

(13)

(14)

if k  c or r, we dene a function lk as the multiplication of its variable

with the number k, i.e.,

lk(r) = k r.

for convenience we also consider k itself as a constant function taking the
value k:

k(r) = k.

other functions such as the power function rs with real number s and the expo-
nential function er are denoted by ps and exp and other elementary functions
are denoted by their standard mathematical symbols.

with these conventions, we can derive the following derivative rules:

k = k,
l
s = s ps1
p
exp = exp,

k = 0,
arctan = 1
ln = p1,

1+p2

,

and the derivative rule for composition of function is

1we denote f f by f 2, f f f by f 3, and so on.

(f  g) = g  f   g

2 some properties of the schwarzian deriva-

tive

now we list some elementary properties of the schwarzian derivative.

(1) if f and g are two functions, we have

s(f  g) = (g )2 s(f )  g + s(g).

for some numbers a, b, c and d, namely, f (r) =

(2) if f =

then

la + b
lc + d

(17)

ar + b
cr + d

,

(18)

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

s(cid:18) la + b

lc + d(cid:19) = 0.

this is the well-know fact that the fractional linear transformation is a global
conformal transformation of the complex sphere. by using this result we have

s(cid:18) la + b

lc + d  g(cid:19) = s(g).

(19)

that is to say, if g is a special solution of the equation s(f ) = r, the general
solution will be

f =

la + b
lc + d  g =

ag + b
cg + d

with constants a, b, c, d such that ad  bc = 1.

(3) for s  r, we have

s(lk) = 0,

,

s2  1
s(ps) =

s(exp) =

s(ln) =

s(tan) = 2,

s(arctan) =

.

where h1 is a yet-unknown function such that

s(h1) =

).

2 d2c1c2

note that in the third line we have considered

s(h3) =

k)2 s(tan)  lk

(32)

combining all the above steps, one nds that

r = s(tanlk  arctanlc1/c2  p d).

and a special solution of eq. (9) is found to be:

namely,

g0 = tanlk  arctanlc1/c2  p d,
d! .
g0(r) = tan k arctanr c1

c2

r

(33)

(34)

(35)

the special case considered in [4] corresponds to k = 1. by using mathematica,
one can easily check that the above function is indeed a solution of eq. (9).

the general solution of eq. (9) is obtained from the above special solution,

eq. (35), by an arbitrary sl(2, r) transformation:

g(r) =

a0 g0(r) + b0
c0 g0(r) + d0

,

where a0, b0, c0 and d0 consist of an sl(2, r) matrix:

a0 d0  b0 c0 = 1.

(36)

(37)

here we have three independent constants. this is the right number for a third
order ordinary dierential equation. so we obtain the complete solution to eq.
(9).

with this general solution in hand one can proceed to obtain the general

solution of (3). for details please see [3].

4 more examples

there are also other examples which can be solved by the above method. one
example comes from the special case d = 0 and the equation is as follows
