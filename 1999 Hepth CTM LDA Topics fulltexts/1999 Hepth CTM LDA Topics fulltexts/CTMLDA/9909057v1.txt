abstract

a particular initial state for the construction of the perturbative expansion of qcd
is investigated. it is formed as a coherent superposition of zero momentum gluon
pairs and shows lorentz as well as global su3 symmetries. it follows that the gluon
and ghost propagators determined by it, coincides with the ones used in an alter-
native of the usual perturbation theory proposed in a previous work. therefore,
the ability of such a procedure of producing a nite gluon condensation parameter
already in the rst orders of perturbation theory is naturally explained. it also fol-
lows that this state satises the physicality condition of the brst procedure in its
kugo and ojima formulation. the brst quantization is done for the value  = 1
of the gauge parameter where the procedure is greatly simplied. therefore, after
assuming that the adiabatic connection of the interaction does not takes out the
state from the interacting physical space, the predictions of the perturbation ex-
pansion, at the value  = 1, for the physical quantities should have meaning. the
validity of this conclusion solves the gauge dependence indeterminacy remained in
the proposed perturbation expansion.

1 introduction.

quantum chromodynamics (qcd) was discovered in the seventies and up to this
time it is considered as the fundamental theory for the strong interactions as a
consequence it has been deeply investigated [1].

in one limit, the smallness of the coupling constant at high momentum (asymp-
totic freedom) made possible the theoretical investigation of the so called hard
processes by using the familiar perturbative language. this so called perturbative
qcd (pqcd) was satisfactorily developed. however, relevant phenomena associ-
ated with the strong interactions cant be described by the standard perturbative
methods and the development of the so called non perturbative qcd is at the
moment one of the challenges of this theory.

one of the most peculiar characteristics of the strong interactions is color con-
nement. according to this physosophy, colored objects, like quarks and gluons,
cant be observed as free particles in contrast with hadrons which are colorless
composite states and eectively detected. the physical nature of such phenomenon
remains unclear. numerous attempts to explain this property have been made, for
example explicit calculations in which the theory is regularized on a spatial lattice
[2], and also through the construction of phenomenological models. in the so called
mit bag model [3],it is assumed that a bag or a bubble is formed around the ob-
jects having color in such a manner that they could not escape from it, because
their eective mass is smaller inside the bag volume and very high outside. within
the so called string model [4], which is based in the assumption that the interaction
forces between quarks and antiquarks grow when the distance increases, in such a
way that the energy increases linearly with the string length e(l) = kl.

a fundamental problem in qcd is the nature of the ground state [5]-[7]. this
state is imagined as a very dense state of matter, composed of gluons and quarks
interacting in a complicated way. its properties are not easily accessible in experi-
ments, because quarks and gluons elds can not be directly observed. furthermore,
the interactions between quarks cant be directly determined. it is already accepted
that in qcd the zero point oscillations of the coupled modes produce a nite en-
ergy density which is determined phenomenologically. the numerical estimate of
it is

evac = fh0 | (gg)2 | 0i = 0.5gev /f m3,

where the so called non perturbative gluonic condensate < 0|(gg)2 |0i was intro-
duced and phenomenologically evaluated by shifman, vainshtein and zakharov
[8]. the negative sign of evac means that the non perturbative vacuum energy is
lower that the one associated to the perturbative vacuum. since a long time ago,
one particular kind of models have shown to be able to predict similar properties.
these are the chromo-magnetic vacuum approaches, in which it is assumed that
a vacuum magnetic eld is existing at all the points [9]. concretely a constant
magnetic abelian eld h is assumed . a one loop calculation gives as the result
the following energy density

2

e (h) =

h 2

2  1 +

bg2

162 ln(cid:18) h

2(cid:19)! .

this formula predicts negative values for the energy at small elds, so the usual
perturbative ground state with h = 0 is unstable with respect to the formation of a
state with a non vanishing eld intensity at which the energy e (h) has a minimum
[9]. many physical problems related with the hadron structure, connement prob-
lem, etc. have been investigated using the savvidy model. nevertheless, after some
time its intense study was abandoned. the main reasons were: 1. the perturba-
tive relation giving evac would only be valid if the second order in the expansion in
powers of the planck constant is relatively small. 2. the specic spatial direction
and the color direction of the magnetic eld break the now seemingly indispensable
lorentz and su(3) invariances of the ground state. 3. the magnetic moment of
the vector particle (gluon) is such that its energy in the presence of the eld has a
negative eigenvalue, which also makes the homogeneous magnetic eld h unstable.

before presenting the objectives of the present work it should be stressed that
the perturbative quantization of qcd [10] is realised in the same way as that in
qed. the quadratic eld terms of the qcd lagrangian have the same form that
the ones corresponding to the electrons and photons in qed. however, in connec-
tion with the interaction, there appear a substantial dierence due to the coupling
of the gluon to itself. in addition is a general fact that a perturbative expansion
has some freedom in dependence on the initial conditions at t   or what
is the same, from the states in which the expansion is based. moreover, as was
expressed before, the exact ground state has a non trivial structure associated to
a gluon condensate.

then, given the above remarks, it is not unreasonable to expect that the true
vacuum state could be well described through a modied feynman expansion per-
turbatively describing a gluon condensate. such a perturbative condensate could
generate all the low energy physical observables which in the standard expansion
could require an innite number of terms of the series.

in a previous work of one of the authors (a.c.) [11], following the above idea,
a modied perturbation theory for qcd was proposed. this expansion retains the
main invariances of the theory (the lorentz and su(3) ones), and is also able to
reproduce main physical predictions of the chromomagnetic eld models. it seems
possible to us that this procedure could produce a reasonable if not good descrip-
tion of the low energy physics.
if it is the case, then, the low and high energy
descriptions of qcd would be unied in a common perturbative framework. in
particular in [11] the results had the interesting outcome of producing a non van-
ishing mean value for the relevant quantity hg2i. in addition the eective potential
for the condensation parameter in the rst order approximation shows a minimum
at non vanishing values of the that parameter. therefore, the procedure is able

3

to reproduce at leat some central predictions of the chromomagnetic models and
general qcd analysis.

the main objective of the present work consists in investigating the foundations
of the mentioned perturbation theory. the concrete aim is to nd a state in the
focks space of the non interacting theory being able to generate that expansion
by also satisfying the physicality condition of the brst quantization approach.

it follows that it is possible to nd the sought for state and it turns out to
be an exponential of a product of two gluon and ghost creation operators. that
is, it can be interpreted as a coherent superposition of states with many zero mo-
mentum gluon and ghost pairs. therefore, this structure gives an explanation for
the ability of the expansion being investigated to produce non zero values of the
gluon condensation in the rst orders of perturbation theory. the fact that the
eective action also shows a minimum for non vanishing values of the condensation
parameter also support the idea that the considered state improves the perturba-
tive expansion. it is also shown that the state satises the linear condition which
denes the physical subspace in the brst quantization for the  = 1 value of the
gauge parameter. thus, the indeniteness in the appropriate value of this param-
eter to be used which remained in the former work is resolved opening the way for
the study of the predictions of the proposed expansion.

the exposition will be organized as follows: in section 2, the brst operatorial
quantization method for gauge elds developed by kugo and ojima is reviewed.
starting from it, in section 3 the ansatz for the focks space state which generates
the wanted form of the perturbative expansion is introduced . the proof that the
state satises the physical state condition is also given in this section. then, in
section 4 it is shown that the proposed state can generate the wanted modication
of the propagator by a proper selection of the parameters at hand. the modication
of the propagator for the ghost particles is also considered in this section.

2 review of the k-o quantization procedure

in the present section the operator formalism developed by t. kugo and i. ojima
[12]-[15] is reviewed and after specialized to the non interacting limit of gluodynam-
ics (gd). this formulation makes use of the invariance of the lagrangian under a
global symmetry operation called the brst transformation [16]. we will consider
the construction of a relativistic invariant initial state in the non-interacting limit
of qcd. the brst physical state condition in the non-interacting limit will be
also imposed. as explained before, the motivation is that we think that this state
has the possibilty to furnish the gluodynamics ground state under the adiabatic
connection of the interaction. in what follows we will work in minkowski space
with the conventions dened below.

associated lie algebra. the matrix  can be represented as a linear combination

ones, satisfying

equivalent to the more familiar  1
at the level of equations of motion
[17] and the feynman diagram expansion. finally (9) is the lagrangian which de-
scribes the dynamics of the unphysical faddeev-popov ghost elds. the denition
of such elds in the kugo and ojima (k.o.) approach is satisfying

(12)

that is, the ghost elds are hermitian. they are usually taken to satisfy [17]

c  = c,
c  = c.

(13)

however, a simple change of variables can transform between the ghost elds
satisfying both kinds of conjugation conditions. the variation in the conjugation
properties allowed kugo and ojima to solve various formal problems which exist for
the application of the brst operator quantization method to qcd, for example
the hermiticity of the lagrangian which guarantees the unitarity of the s-matrix.

the physical state conditions in the brst procedure [18],[19] are given by

qb|physi = 0,
qc|physi = 0,

(14)

where

qb =z d3x(cid:20)ba (x) 0ca (x) + gba (x) f abcab

g0 (ca) f abccb (x) cc (x)(cid:21) ,

(15)

f (x) 0g (x)  f (x) 0g (x)  0 (f (x)) g (x) .

(16)

the brst charge is conserved as a consequence of the brst symmetry of the

lagrangian (6).the also conserved charge qc is given by

qc = iz d3xhca (x) 0ca (x) + gca (x) f abcab

0 (x) cc (x)i ,

(17)

which conservation comes from the noether theorem due to the invariance of la-
grangian (6) under the phase transformation c  ec, c  ec. this charge
denes the so called ghost number as the dierence between the number of c
and c ghosts.

our interest will be centered here in the yang-mills theory without spontaneous
breaking of the gauge symmetry in the limit of no interaction. the quantization of

6

the theory dened by the lagrangian (6), after to be considered in the interaction
free limit g  0, leads to the following commutation relations for the free elds

 (x) , ab

 (y)i = ab (igd (x  y) + i (1  ) e (x  y)) ,

haa

 (x) , bb (y)i = ab (id (x  y)) ,
hba (x) , bb (y)i = nca (x) , cb (y)o =nca (x) , cb (y)o = 0,
nca (x) , cb (y)o = d (x  y) .

the e functions [18] are dened by

(18)

(19)

e (x) =

1

2(cid:16)2(cid:17)1(cid:16)x00  1(cid:17) d (x) .

the equations of motions for the non-interacting elds takes the simple form

aa

 (x)  (1  ) ba (x) = 0,

aa

 (x) + ba (x) = 0,

ba (x) = ca (x) = ca (x) = 0.

(20)

(21)

(22)

this equations can be solved for arbitrary values of . however, as it was said
before, the discussion will be restricted to the case  = 1 which corresponds to
the situation in which all the gluon components satisfy the dalambert equation.
this selection, as considered in the framework of the usual perturbative expansion,
implies that you are not able to check the  independence of the physical quanti-
ties. however in the present discussion the aim is to construct a perturbative state
that satises the brst physicality condition, in order to connect adiabatically the
interaction. then, the physical character of all the prediction will follow whenever
the former assumption that adiabatic connection does not take the state out of
the physical subspace at any intermediate state is valid. clearly, the considera-
tion of dierent values of , would be also a convenient recourse for checking the
 independent perturbative expansions. however, at this stage it is preferred to
delay the more technical issue of implementing the brst quantization for any
value of  for future work.

in that way the eld equations in the  = 1 gauge will be

 (x) = 0,

 (x) + ba (x) = 0,

the above commutation rules and equation of motions dene the quantized
non-interacting limit of gd. it is possible now to start dening the alternative
interaction free ground state to be considered for the adiabatic connection of the
interaction. as discussed before, the expectation is that the physics of the per-
turbation theory being investigated is able to furnish a helpful description of low

9

energy physical eects.

here it is possible to remark that one of the rst tasks of the work was to
construct a state that could generate a modication to the propagator in quantum
electrodynamics being similar to the one in [11]. for this purpose we used the
quantication operator method developed by gupta and bleuler (gb), however, it
was not possible to nd any state that would generate this covariant modication
to the propagator and that satises the physical state condition imposed by this
method [20].

3 the alternative initial state

after beginning to work in the k.o. formalism some indications were found about
that the appropriate state vector obeying the physical condition in this procedure
could have the general structure

p,2aa+

p al,a+

p + ica+

p ca+

p,1aa+

p,1 + c2 (p) aa+

p,2 + c3 (p)(cid:16)ba+

|i = expxa (cid:16)c1 (p) aa+
p (cid:17)(cid:17) | 0i,
(36)
where p = (|~p| , ~p) is an auxiliary null 4-momentum, |~p| is chosen as one of the few
smallest values of the modulus of the spatial momentum of the quantized theory in
a nite volume v . this value will be taken after in the limit v   for recovering
lorentz invariance. from here on the sum on the color index a will be explicit. the
parameters ci (p) will be xed below from the condition that the free propagator
associated to a state satisfying the brst physical state condition, coincides with
the one proposed in the previous work [11]. the solution of this problem, would
then give foundation to the physical implications of the discussion in that work.

it should also be noticed that the states dened by (36) have some similarity
with coherent states [21]. however, in the present case, the creation operators
appear in squares. thus, the argument of the exponential creates pairs of physical
and non-physical particles. an important property of this function is that its con-
struction in terms of pairs of creation operators determines that the mean value of
an odd number of eld operator vanishes. this is at variance with the standard
coherent state, in that the mean values of the elds are non zero. the vanishing of
the mean eld is a property in common with the standard perturbative vacuum,
which lorentz invariance could be broken by any non-zero expectation value of
the 4-vector of the gauge eld. it should be also stressed that this state as formed
by the superposition of states of pair of gluons suggests a connection with some
recent works in the literature that consider the formation of gluons pairs due to
color interactions.

let us argue below that the state (36) satises the brst physical conditions

4 gluon and ghost modied propagators.

let us consider the determination of the form of the main elements of perturbation
theory, that is the free particle propagators. it will be seen that the propagators
associated to the considered state has the same form as proposed in [11] under a
proper selection of the parameters. consider the generating functional of the free
particle green functions as given by

 (j)  he | t(cid:18)exp(cid:26)iz d4xj (x) a0 (x)(cid:27)(cid:19) | ei.

as a consequence of the wick theorem it can be written in the form [22]

(54)

 (j)  he | exp(cid:26)iz d4xj (x) a0 (x)(cid:27) exp(cid:26)iz d4yj (y) a0+ (x)(cid:27) | ei
 exp(cid:26)iz d4yz d4x (y0  x0) j (y) j (x)ha0 (x) , a0+ (y)i(cid:27) . (55)

therefore, the sought for modication to the free propagator is completely

determined by the term

ya=1,..,8he | exp(cid:26)iz d4xj ,a (x) aa

 (x)(cid:27) exp(cid:26)iz d4xj ,a (x) aa+

after a systematic use of the commutation relations among the anihilation and
creation operators, the exponential operators can be decomposed in products of ex-
ponential for each space-time mode. this fact allows us to perform the calculation
for each kind of wave independently. considering rst the transversal components
one obtains

the expressions for the longitudinal and scalars can be evaluated in a similar

manner and are found to be

here it should be noticed that the sign dierence is produced by the commu-

tation relations.

for the calculation of the total modication (56), it is needed to evaluate

h | exp(cid:26)iz d4xj ,a (x) aa

 (x)(cid:27) =(cid:18)exp(cid:26)iz d4xj ,a (x) aa+

 (x)(cid:27) | i(cid:19)

(62)

which may be easily obtained by conjugating the result for the l.h.s of (59).

in what follows the following notation will be being employed

after forming the scalar product of (61) and (62) the following factors are

obtained for each color value

(64)

where the parts of the expression associated to each space-time mode are also de-
coupled.

in evaluating these matrix elements the idea was the following. first to expand
the exponents of the exponential operators being at the left of the scalar products
in (64) by factorizing the exponential operator having an exponent being linear in
the sources j. after that, taking into account that the inverse of this linear oper-
ator is anihilating the vacuum, it follows that the net eect of this linear operator
is to shift the creation elds entering in the exponential operators at the right of
the scalar products in (64) in a constant being linear in the sources j. further,
the same procedure can be performed to act with the exponential factor which can
be also extracted from the new exponential operator acting on the vacuum at the
right. now its action on the operators at the left of the scale product (64) reduces
again to a shift in a constant in the anihilation elds dening this operator. in
such a way it is possible to arrive to a recurrence relation which can be proven by
mathematical induction.

the recurrence relation obtained after n steps in the case of the transversal

modes takes the form

(65)

after restricting the possible values of c to satisfy |c (p)| < 1

2 the linear part
of the operators in the exponent is multiplied by a quantity tending to zero in the
limit n =  and it can be omitted in such a limit. by also using the formula for
the geometrical series the following expression can be obtained for (65)

in a similar manner for the factors in (64) corresponding to longitudinal and

scalar modes it can be obtained

(67)

therefore, after collecting the contributions of all the modes and substituting
j a
p,i, by also assuming 2c1 (p) = 2c2 (p) = c3 (p) (which follows necessarily in
order to obtain lorentz invariance!) and making use of the properties of the basis
vectors dened before, the modication to the propagator becomes

now it is possible to perform the limit process ~p  0. in doing this limit, it
is considered that each component of the linear momentum p is related with the
quantization volume by

(70)

then, after xing a dependence of the arbitrary constant c3 of the form

|c3 (p)|  (1  p2) ,  > 0, y c3 (0) 6= 1 the limit(70) becomes

(71)

where c is an arbitary constant determined by the also arbitrary factor  . an
analysis of its properties has been done which shows that c can take only real and
positive values.

therefore, the total modication to the propagator including all color values

turns to be

ya=1,..,8he | exp(cid:26)iz d4xj ,a (x) aa

also, the generating functional associated to the proposed initial state can be

written in the form

 = exp

(73)

(74)

which shows that the gluon propagator has the same form proposed in [11], for
the selected gauge parameter value  = 1 (which corresponds to  = 1 in that

17

reference).

finally, let us consider the possible modications of the ghost propagator which

can be produced by the new initial state. it is needed to evalute the expression

a

ya=1,..,8he | exp(cid:26)iz d4x(cid:16)
 exp(cid:26)iz d4x(cid:16)

(x) ca (x) + ca (x) a (x)(cid:17)(cid:27)
(x) ca+ (x) + ca+ (x) a (x)(cid:17)(cid:27) | ei.

a

(75)

in this case the calculation is simpler because the fermionic character of the
ghost makes that only two non vanishing terms exist in the series expansion of
the exponentials. therefore, here it is unnecessary to employ recurrence relations.
the following result for (75) is obtained

exp xa=1,..8

iz d4xd4y

(x) a (y)

cg

(2)4

(76)

where in this case cg is an arbitrary constant which can be greater or equal than
zero. it will be equal to zero if taking c3 (0) real and tending to one. this selection
makes that the result coincides with the one in the reference [11] where the ghost
propagator was not modied.

the expression of the generating functional for the ghost particles takes the

form

5 summary

by using the operational formulation of the quantum gauge fields theory de-
veloped by kugo and ojima, it was constructed a particular state vector of qcd
in the non-interacting limit which obeys the brst physical state condition. the
general motivation for looking for this wavefunction is to search for a reasonably
good description of low energy qcd properties, through giving foundation to the
perturbative expansion proposed in [11]. the high energy qcd description should
not be aected by the modied perturbative initial state. in addition it can be
expect that the adiabatic connection of the color interaction starting with it as an
initial condition, generate at the end the true qcd interacting ground state. in
case of having the above properties, the analysis would allow to understand the

18

real vacuum as a the superposition of innite number of soft gluon pairs.

it has been checked that properly xing the free parameters in the constructed
state, the perturbation expansion proposed in the former work is reproduced for
the special value  = 1 of the gauge constant. therefore, the appropriate gauge
is determined for which the expansion introduced in that article is produced by
an initial state, satisfying the physical state condition for the brst quantization
procedure. the fact that the non-interacting initial state is a physical one, lead
to expect that the nal wavefunction after the adiabatic connection of the inter-
action will also satisfy the physical state condition for the interacting theory. if
this assumption is correct, the results of the calculations of transition amplitudes
and the values of physical quantities should be also physically meaningful. in fu-
ture, a quantization procedure for arbitrary values of  will be also considered.
it is expected that with its help the gauge parameter independence of the phys-
ical quantities could be implemented.
it seems possible that the results of this
generalisation will lead to  dependent polarisations for gluons and ghosts and
their respective propagators, which however could produce  independent results
for the physical quantities. however, this more involved discussion will be delayed
for future consideration.

it is important to mention now a result obtained during the calculation of the
modication to the gluon propagator, in the chosen regularisation. it is that the
arbitrary constant c is determined here to be real and positive. this outcome
restricts an existing arbitrariness in the discussion given in the previous work. as
this quantity c is also determining the square of the generated gluon mass as pos-
itive or negative, real or imaginary, therefore it seems very congruent to arrive to
a denite prediction of c as real and positive.

the modication to the standard free ghost propagator introduced by the pro-
posed initial state of the non interacting theory also was calculated. moreover,
after considering the free parameter in the proposed trial state as real, which it
seems the most natural assumption, the ghost propagator is not be modied. this
unaltered free one particle greens function was assumed in [11], as a possible vari-
ant suggested by the fact that the modication do not contribute in the one loop
calculation of the gluon self- energy.

some tasks which can be addressed in future works are: the study of the appli-
cability of the gell-mann and low theorem with respect to the adiabatic connection
of the interactions, starting from the here proposed initial state. the investiga-
tion the quantization of zero modes (that is gluon states with exact vanishing four
momentum). the ability to consider them with success would allow a formally
cleaner denition of the proposed state, by excluding the auxiliary momentum p
recurrently used in the construction realized here. finally, the application of the
proposed perturbation theory in the study of some problems linked with conne-
ment and the hadron structure.
