abstract

it has been proposed that gauge and kahler anomalies in four-dimensional type iib ori-
entifolds are cancelled by a generalized green-schwarz mechanism involving exchange of
twisted rr-elds. we explain how this can be understood using the well-known duality be-
tween linear and chiral multiplets. we nd that all the twisted elds associated to the n = 1
sectors and some of the elds associated to the n = 2 sectors reside in linear multiplets.
but there are no linear multiplets associated to order-two twists. only the linear multiplets
contribute to anomaly cancellation. this suces to cancel all u(1) anomalies. in the case
of kahler symmetries the complete sl(2, ir) can be restored at the quantum level for all
planes that are not xed by an order-two twist.

1 introduction

anomaly freedom is one of the basic requirements for gauge theories. at rst sight, a
gauge theory can only be consistent if the charged matter content is precisely such that
all anomalous one-loop diagrams vanish. however, in low-energy eective theories of string
theory there is another possibility. the anomalous one-loop diagram can be cancelled by an
additional interaction which in the eective eld theory appears as the tree-level exchange
of a eld coupling to the gauge elds in exactly the right manner. in the seminal work of
green and schwarz [1] it is shown how the hexagon anomalies in d = 10 are cancelled by
the exchange of the nsns 2-form b. in d = 4 b is dual to a scalar  which has axionic
couplings. the special interactions between  and the gauge elds indeed cancel the triangle
anomalies [2]. only u(1) anomalies that are universal with respect to the dierent gauge
group factors ga (i.e. the coecient of the g2
au(1) triangle diagram is independent of a)
can be cancelled by this mechanism. incidentally, all gauge anomalies in four-dimensional
heterotic vacua are of this form.

the situation is dierent in type i vacua where non-universal u(1) gauge anomalies
appear. as string theory is believed to be consistent, there must be additional interactions
that cancel these anomalies. in [3, 4] a generalized version of the green-schwarz mechanism
was proposed which cancels the u(1) anomalies in d = 6 via exchange of twisted rr elds
(explicit calculations for many models are performed in [5]). the authors of [6] applied this
idea to type iib orientifold vacua in d = 4 and showed that all anomalies can be cancelled
this way. they also pointed out that anomalies of the invariance of the eective theory under
kahler transformations can be cancelled by the same mechanism [7].

in the present article we explain how the anomalous transformation of the twisted rr
axions, which are responsible for anomaly cancellation, can be understood by considering
the chern-simons couplings of the rr 2-forms. in the next section we show that the rr
2-forms which appear in the twisted spectrum of type iib orientifolds belong to n = 1
linear multiplets1 l(k), where k labels the twisted sectors. we nd that all sectors except
the k = n/2 sector (for even n) contain linear multiplets. the two crucial ingredients for
this generalized green-schwarz mechanism to work are a chern-simons modication of the

eld strength associated to the rr 2-form and an additional term r d2d2  pk l(k) tr(kv )

in the d = 4 eective lagrangian (v is the vector multiplet corresponding to the anomalous
u(1) and k is the matrix representing the twist on the gauge indices). both terms can be
derived from string theory by considering either branes within branes [11] or by using the
inow mechanism [12] (for d = 6 the relevant couplings are calculated in [13]).

a linear multiplet l(k) is dual to a chiral multiplet m (k) in the sense that there exists an
equivalent description of the theory in terms of m (k) [14, 10]. translating the chern-simons
modication of the rr eld strength and the l(k)v term to the chiral basis, one nds that
the m (k) couple to the gauge elds just in the right way to cancel the anomalies. this is
discussed in section 3.

in section 4 we apply this method to kahler anomalies and argue that a coupling of the
kl(k) ln(ti + ti) must be present, where ti is the chiral supereld which

1some useful facts about linear multiplets are assembled in appendix a; see also [8, 9, 10].

parameterizes the kahler class of the i-th complex compact plane. this leads to a non-trivial
transformation of the dual chiral multiplets of twisted states m (k) and cancels the kahler
anomalies. more precisely, only the kahler symmetries corresponding to complex planes
that are not xed under an order-two twist can be restored at the quantum level by this
mechanism. however, an order-two twist implies the existence of d5-branes. the coupling
of the t3 (we chose the third complex plane to be xed under the order-two twist) to the
d5-brane gauge elds explicitely breaks the kahler symmetry for the third plane. therefore
one cannot expect an anomaly cancellation for this plane. in contrast to the situation in
heterotic string vacua, the full sl(2, ir) symmetry seems to be preserved for xed planes
which are not xed under an order-two twist.

in section 5 we give the low-energy eective lagrangian describing the interactions of
the moduli (dilaton, twisted and untwisted moduli) and the gauge elds. we determine the
values of the fayet-iliopoulos terms and the masses of the (pseudo-)anomalous gauge bosons.
an appendix summarizes useful results of n = 1 supersymmetry, concerning linear

multiplets and d-terms of general chiral lagrangians.

2 massless twisted spectrum of type iib orientifolds

in this article we consider compact z n orientifolds (see [15, 16] and references therein).
they are obtained from the ten-dimensional type iib theory by compactifying on a six-
dimensional torus and projecting onto z n - and -invariant states. here  = j, with
 the world-sheet parity and j an operator acting on the twisted sectors [17] as explained
below. for consistency one has to add twisted closed strings and open strings. the compact
dimensions form a six-torus t 6 = ir6/, where  is a six-dimensional lattice chosen such
that the generator  of z n acts on it as an automorphism. acting on ,  is a (6 6) integer
matrix. its action on the coordinates of t 6 can be diagonalized over the complex numbers:
 = diag(e2iv1, e2iv2, e2iv3), where we grouped the coordinates of t 6 into three complex

planes. the twist vector v = (v1, v2, v3) is chosen such that 0 < |vi| < 1 and pi vi = 0. in

general there are dierent lattices , on which a twist (v) acts as an automorphism. the
orbifold is dened to be the space t 6/zn , whereas the orientifold includes an additional
projection of the strings moving on the orbifold onto -invariant states. all possible z n -
twists  and lattices  leading to d = 4, n = 1 orbifolds have been classied in [18]. in [16]
it was found that of the possible z n models only the ones shown in table 1 lead to consistent
type iib orientifolds (i.e. the tadpoles can be cancelled).

the massless spectrum of these models has been determined in [16]. however in the
twisted sector only the number of states is given.
in addition, for each twist (v) only
one possible lattice (implicitly assumed as factorizable) is considered. as we are interested
in the precise n = 1 multiplets containing the twisted states, we rederive the spectrum by
considering the cohomology of the compact orbifold space [18, 19, 20]. this method was used
in [21, 22] to obtain the massless spectrum of twisted states of orientifold models in d = 6
and d = 4. the orbifold cohomology is encoded in the hodge numbers hp,q = dim h p,q,
where h p,q is the space of harmonic (p, q)-forms. for six-dimensional compact orbifolds (i.e.

d = 4 non-compact dimensions) one has

h0,0 = h3,0 = h0,3 = h3,3 = 1,

h1,1 = h2,2,

h2,1 = h1,2.

(2.1)

here h1,1 and h2,1 are the numbers of z n -invariant (1, 1)-forms and (2, 1)-forms of the six-
torus. there are additional contributions h1,1

tw from the twisted sector.

tw and h2,1

the bosonic elds of type iib theory in d = 10 are the dilaton , the metric g and a
2-form b from the nsns sector and a scalar c(0), a 2-form c(2) and a 4-form c(4) from the
rr sector. under the worldsheet parity , g and c(2) are even, the other elds being odd.
in the untwisted sector  =  and therefore the bosonic elds in d = 4 are obtained by
contracting the lorentz indices of , g and c(2) with the harmonic forms of the orbifold.
from h0,0, h3,0, h0,3, h3,3 one gets the d = 4 graviton, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor. the
latter two elds (together with the corresponding fermion) form an n = 1 linear multiplet.
from the remaining harmonic forms one nds h1,1 chiral multiplets ti corresponding to
deformations of the kahler class and h2,1 chiral multiplets ui corresponding to deformations
of the complex structure.

let us now consider the twisted sectors. for the k-th twisted sector there is a singular
subspace mk which is xed under the action of k. the cohomology h p,q
k-twisted of this space
contributes to h p+nk,q+nk of the orbifold, where nk = pi
kvi and kvi = k vi mod z, such that
0  kvi < 1. the spaces m1 and mn 1 consist of the set of xed points of the orbifold.
more generally, for twists k, such that all kvi 6= 0, the spaces mk and mn k consist of the
set of xed points under the action of k. for such k < n/2 one nds nk = 1, nn k = 2
(with two exceptions, explained below, where nk = 2, nn k = 1). if kvi = 0 for some i, then
the i-th complex plane is xed under k. in this case the spaces mk and mn k consist of
the set of xed planes. for such k one nds nk = nn k = 1. denote the number of k xed
points by fk (if kvi 6= 0). if kvi = 0 for some i let f 
k be the number of k xed planes. on the
other hand we dene f (i)
to be the number of k xed points of the four-dimensional space
k
consisting only of the two rotated planes (i.e. the compact space without the i-th plane). if
the lattice  splits into a direct sum (over the integers) of sublattices,  = i  j, such that
i is xed under k and this block structure is preserved under k, then f 
k is just given by
f (i)
k . as noted by the authors of [18], this condition is not always satised, leading (in some
cases) to a smaller value of f 
k. however, we will restrict ourselves to lattices satisfying this
condition. these are the ones that were discussed in [16, 6, 7].

here we used the fact that on a point one can only dene a (0, 0)-form. if gcd(k, n) 6= 1,
then only f1 of the fk k xed points are invariant under z n . the remaining (fk  f1) xed
points transform under a z gcd(k,n ) (resp. z p or z q if gcd(k, n) = pq) subgroup of z n . one
can however form linear combinations of gcd(k, n) xed points that are invariant under the
whole z n . note that h1,1
k = 0 for k < n/2, with two exceptions.
this means that for k < n/2 the h2,2
n k forms furnish the antiparticles corresponding to the
particles from the h1,1
forms. the two exceptions are the k = 3 sector of z 7 and the k = 5
k
sector of z 12, where the particles come from the (n  k)-th sector (i.e. h1,1
n k 6= 0) and the
antiparticles from h2,2
k .

k = 0 for k > n/2 and h2,2

in the case of xed planes one has to consider the torus cohomology which is h0,0 = h1,0 =
h0,1 = h1,1 = 1. the (0, 0)-form and the (1, 1)-form are z n -invariant but the (1, 0)-form and
the (0, 1)-form generically transform under a z k subgroup of z n . if kvi = 0, then f (i)
is the
1
number of tori that are xed under the whole z n . again one can form linear combinations
of the the other k xed tori and of the forms dened on them that are invariant under the
whole z n . in total, one nds for gcd(k, n) = pq (if gcd(k, n) =prime, set q = 1)

for the orbifolds of table 1 we nd the twisted hodge numbers listed in table 2. (for

completeness we added the untwisted hodge numbers in the last column.)

the twisted bosonic elds of the d = 4 theory are obtained by contracting the bosonic
elds in d = 10 with the additional harmonic forms from the twisted sectors. now the
operator j in  = j is important because it exchanges the sector twisted by k with the
one twisted by n k [17]. to get an -invariant result, one has to contract the -even
elds g and c(2) with the j-even linear combinations of harmonic forms from the k-th and
(n  k)-th twisted sector and the -odd elds b and c(4) with j-odd linear combinations
of harmonic forms.

from the twisted sectors with no xed planes one nds h1,1

scalars in d = 4 from the j-
even sector and the same number of antisymmetric tensors from the j-odd sector. together

adding the contributions from the twisted sectors k = 1, . . . ,n/2 (because of the
orientifold projection the sectors k > n/2 give no independent degrees of freedom) we nd
the following twisted elds, table 3.

to understand the role of the twisted elds in the anomaly cancellation mechanism, it is
important to note two facts: first, all twisted elds associated to twists that rotate all planes
appear in n = 1 linear multiplets. second, in the twisted sectors with xed planes only some
of the elds are in n = 1 linear multiplets and all of them appear in the k 6= n/2 sectors.
2the spectrum of the k-th twisted sector with kvi = 0 can also be understood by compactifying on a
four-dimensional zm orientifold [15, 21], with m = n/ gcd(k, n ), and then dimensionally reducing on a two-
torus. for the k-th twisted sector of the zm orientifold the authors nd f (i)
k )/ gcd(k, m) d = 6,
n = 1 hypers and, if k 6= m/2, the same number of additional tensors (a k 6= m/2 sector exists if m 6= 2, i.e.
k 6= n/2). from these, f (i)
k ) correspond to z n xed points in the four-dimensional compact
space. the remaining multiplets can be grouped into h2,1
k dierent zn -invariant linear combinations. from
each of the f (i)
1 d = 6, n = 1 hypers and tensors only half the states are z n -invariant (in terms of d = 4,
n = 1: a linear and a chiral multiplet). the h2,1
linear combinations of twisted states reduce to n = 2
hypers and vector-tensors in d = 4. (the latter are equivalent to n = 2 vectors because an antisymmetric
tensor is dual to a scalar in d = 4.)

we will see that only n = 1 linear multiplets can contribute to anomaly cancellation.

3 gauge anomaly cancellation

it is well known that the d = 4 version of the green-schwarz anomaly cancellation mech-
anism [2] is closely related to the equivalence between the linear and the chiral n = 1
supermultiplets. more precisely, in the heterotic string the transformation of the chiral dila-
ton supereld that cancels the anomaly can be understood by starting with the linear dilaton
multiplet that appears in the string spectrum and then translating the lagrangian carefully
to the description in terms of a chiral eld (see e.g. [24, 25, 26]).
in the present article
we apply this method to the anomaly cancellation mechanism in n = 1, d = 4 type iib
orientifolds [6, 7]. the new features are that several linear multiplets are involved and that
their vacuum expectation value is not related to the string loop expansion but rather to the
blowing-up of the orbifold singularities.

3.1 purely bosonic case

we start by reviewing the d = 4 green-schwarz mechanism as it can be derived from
the equivalence between an antisymmetric tensor b and a scalar  without making any
use of supersymmetry.3 start from an auxiliary lagrangian describing the interactions of a
non-dynamical eld y  with the antisymmetric tensor and several gauge elds:

are indeed generated and that the coecient is b3 = a(a)/(k(a)82), independently of a,
which is just the right value to cancel the anomalies.

for the case of type iib orientifolds we need to generalize the above formulae to in-
, where k labels the dierent twisted sectors k =

clude several antisymmetric tensors b(k,f )



1, . . . ,l n 1

2 m and f = 1, . . . , fk counts the xed points4 of each twisted sector (in general

not all of these elds are independent). the k = n/2 sector (for even n) is excluded, be-
cause we saw in the previous section that it contains no antisymmetric tensors. only certain
linear combinations of the antisymmetric tensors are involved in the anomaly cancellation
mechanism. we dene

we will see that only in one case, namely the second twisted sector of z
contribute to anomaly cancellation.

from the study of rr forms and their coupling to d-branes it has been found that in the
presence of gauge elds on the d-branes the rr eld strengths are modied by chern-simons
terms (see e.g. [11, 13]). in our case of twisted rr 2-forms we have

h (k,f )

 = [b(k,f )

] + kc2xa

q(k,a)




h (k)

 = [b(k)

] + kc2xa qfkq(k,a)

 ,

(3.15)

where c2 is a normalization factor of mass dimension 2 and k is a sign, that will be deter-
mined below. the chern-simons form now depends on the twist matrix k that represents
the action of k on the gauge indices,

q(a)

(3.16)

the study of rr forms also shows [11, 13] that terms of the form tr(k exp(if ))  c
appear in the eective action, where f is the gauge eld strength 2-form, c is the sum over
rr forms of dierent degrees and it is understood that after expansion of the exponential
only the terms with the correct total form degree are kept. for us of interest is the term
coupling the rr 2-form to the (pseudo-)anomalous u(1)x

5:

c3 tr(ki f (0)

 )b(k),

(3.17)

where c3 is a normalization factor of mass dimension 2.

in the conventions of [16] the ks are parametrized by a 16-dimensional shift vector v and
a 16-dimensional vector h containing the cartan generators of so(32): k = exp(2ikh 
v ). the trace over the product of k with the gauge group generators (a) is easily calculated
to give [6]: tr(k2
(a)) = cos(2kva) and tr(ki(0)) = 2nx sin(2kvx). here va is the
component of the shift vector v corresponding to the gauge group ga and nx is the rank
of the non-abelian group in which u(1)x is embedded. comparison with (3.8) where we
normalized the traces to one leads to the identication

2 = kc2qfk cos(2kva),
b(k,a)

b(k)
3 = 2nxc3 sin(2kvx).

(3.22)

i=1 2 sin(kvi) if the gauge groups ga and u(1)x live either both on the d9-
branes or both on the d5-branes [6]. in this case one has (ck)2 = fk if the k-th sector has no
xed planes and ck = 0 else. an explicit calculation of the various cks for the considered

where ck = q3
models shows that ck = fk for the sectors k < n/2 of all models, except the k = 3 sector

of z 7 and the k = 5 sector of z 12. this is related to the fact, that these two sectors furnish
antiparticles, whereas in all other cases the antiparticles come from k > n/2, as we saw in
the previous section. let us dene k = 1 for the third sector of z 7 and the fth sector of
z 12 and k = 1 for all other sectors. then we have
ck = kqfk.

if ga and u(1)x live on dierent types of branes (this is called the 95-sector), then ck =
2 sin(kv3), where it was assumed that the d5-branes are extended in the four-dimensional
space-time and in the third complex plane and are at the origin in the rst and second
complex planes. it turns out that the only contribution to a(a) from twisted sectors with
xed planes is from the 95-sector and is only in the k = 2 sector of z
6 non-vanishing. in the
previous section we saw that there are six antisymmetric tensors from this sector associated
to the second plane. but only three of them can couple to the d5-branes because they are
associated to xed planes located at the origin in the rst complex direction. in analogy
to (3.14) we therefore dene b(2)
(and 2 = 1). in the k = 3 sector
of z 12 there are two more antisymmetric tensors, associated to the third complex plane.
they do not seem to couple to the d5-branes. from (3.18) one therefore nds that all gauge
anomalies are cancelled if

(3.24)

it seems dicult to obtain the separate values of the coecients c2 and c3 because, under a
eld redenition b(k)
 , these coecients scale as c2  c2 and c3  c3/. if one
chooses a normalization such that the term in front of 1

(3.25)

then c2 = /2n. the string tension  is inferred from dimensional analysis (recall that
 has dimension of mass squared). a careful determination of the coecient appearing in
(3.17) should then yield c3 = 1/(82) to satisfy the condition (3.24).

6a factor 2 compared to the result of [6] is due to our choice of normalization of gauge group generators,

tr(ij ) = ij.

3.2 supersymmetric case

the supersymmetric generalization of the auxiliary lagrangian (3.1) is

l = z d2d2  (cid:18) 1

4b1

y 2 + y l + 4b3v (0)l(cid:19) ,

(3.26)

where y is a real but otherwise unconstrained supereld, v (0) is the vector multiplet cor-
responding to the u(1)x gauge symmetry and l is a (modied) linear multiplet containing
the antisymmetric tensor eld strength.
in components one has (see eqs. (a.3), (a.8) of
appendix a)

l = l +  +   +   h + . . . ,

tr( w (a) w (a)),

d2l = 2b(a)

tr(w (a)w (a)),

(3.28)

where d2 = dd, d2 = d  d  are the supercovariant derivatives and w (a)
is the chiral
eld strength multiplet associated to the gauge symmetry ga. these equations are the
2b(a)
supersymmetric generalization of the modied bianchi identity  h = 1
tr(f (a) f (a)),
which follows from (3.5).



2

again two equivalent descriptions can be obtained from (3.26) by varying with respect

to y or l.

(1) from y l = 0 one nds y = 2b1l and, inserting this into (3.26),

ll = z d2d2  (cid:16)b1l2 + 4b3v (0)l(cid:17) ,

(3.29)

2

tr( w (a) w (a)), d2l = 2b(a)

with d2l = 2b(a)
tr(w (a)w (a)). expanding this lagrangian in
component elds (see eqs. (a.10), (a.13)), one nds that the bosonic part coincides with
the lagrangian (3.8) if we set the additional boson l to a constant value hli and identify the
gauge coupling constants as g2

2

(a) = 2b1b(a)

2 hli.

(2) the variation with respect to l is more subtle because it is a constrained supereld,
satisfying (3.28). a modied linear multiplet can always be written in terms of unconstrained
supereld spinors ,   and a 3-form multiplet  containing the chern-simons 3-form (see
e.g. [10, 9]), such that l   contains no couplings to gauge elds and satises the usual
linear constraint d2(l  ) = d2(l  ) = 0:

l = d d2 + d d2   + ,

(3.30)

with d2 = 2b(a)
variation with respect to ,  leads to

tr( w (a) w (a)), d2 = 2b(a)

2

2

tr(w (a)w (a)). an integration by parts and

d2d(y + 4b3v (0)) = 0 = d2 d (y + 4b3v (0)),

(3.31)

which is solved by

y = s + s  4b3v (0),

where s is an arbitrary chiral supereld, with components s = s +2 + f + i s +

2
2
b3a(0)
 ) + . . ., which is the generalization of (3.9). the normalization is chosen such that the
lagrangian shown below has canonical kinetic terms if b1 = 1. the sign of s + s in (3.32)
cannot be xed; our choice is analogy to the low-energy eective action of the heterotic
4s d2l =

string (see below). inserting (3.32) into (3.26) and using the identity r d2  sl =  1

(3.33)

the bosonic part of this lagrangian coincides with (3.10) if we set the additional boson
re(s) to a constant value and identify g2
2 hre(s)i (for consistency one must have
b(a)
2 hre(s)i < 0).

(a) = 2b(a)

in the low-energy eective theory of string theory one has a logarithmic kahler potential

for the dilaton supereld. we therefore introduce the auxiliary lagrangian

l = z d2d2  (cid:16)b1 ln(y /b1) + y ldil + 4b3v (0)ldil(cid:17) .

in exactly the same manner as above one derives the two equivalent descriptions.

(1) from y l = 0 one nds y = b1/ldil, which (using r d2d2  b1 = 0) leads to

lldil = z d2d2  (cid:16)b1 ln(ldil) + 4b3v (0)ldil(cid:17) ,

(3.34)

(3.35)

2

tr( w (a) w (a)), d2ldil = 2b(a)

describes the nsns 2-form b, the dilaton  in the lowest component of ldil, ldil = e2,
and the gauge elds.

with d2ldil = 2b(a)
tr(w (a)w (a)). an expansion in components
(see eqs. (a.10), (a.13)) shows that (in the limit where gravity decouples) this is part of the
eective lagrangian for heterotic string vacua in d = 4 with gauge group g = qa ga. it
(2) writing ldil again as in (3.30) and varying with respect to , , one nds y =
sdil + sdil  4b3v (0), as in eq. (3.32). note that the sign of sdil + sdil in y is xed because we
want to identify sdil with the chiral dilaton multiplet, which implies rehsi > 0 and b(a)
2 < 0.
inserting y in (3.34) yields

lsdil = z d2d2  b1 ln(cid:16)sdil + sdil  4b3v (0)(cid:17)

2 z d2 b(a)



2 sdil tr(w (a)w (a))

2 z d2  b(a)

2

sdil tr( w (a) w (a)).

(3.36)

this dual description of heterotic vacua is more familiar because it is easier to deal with a
chiral supereld than with a linear multiplet. as mentioned above (in the paragraph below

12

(3.13)), in the heterotic string the coecient b(a)
2
b(a)
2 = k(a)/4. we identify 
dual to the antisymmetric tensor. this leads to gauge couplings g(a) = ehi/k(a).

is universal up to the kac-moody level k(a):
2 s = e2 + ia, where  is the dilaton and a the scalar eld

from the kinetic terms for sdil one sees that, under a u(1)x gauge transformation v (0) 
2 ( + ), sdil transforms as sdil  sdil + 2b3. the variation of the lagrangian is

v (0) + 1
thus given by

lsdil = z d2   a(a)

322  b(a)

2 b3! tr(w (a)w (a)) + h.c.

(3.37)

this vanishes if the condition (3.13) is satised, which, as we saw above, does indeed happen
for heterotic string vacua in d = 4.

in type iib orientifolds one has several linear multiplets l(k,f ) from the twisted sectors,

where k = 1, . . . ,l n 1

2 m, f = 1, . . . , fk (not all of them are independent). in generalization

of (3.14) we dene the linear combinations

l(k) =

1

fk xf

l(k,f ).

the supersymmetric generalization of the chern-simons coupling (3.15) reads

d2l(k) = 2c2ck tr(k w (a) w (a)),

d2l(k) = 2c2ck tr(kw (a)w (a)).

i=1 2 sin(kvi) for all sectors except the second sector of z

6, where ck = 3.

the coupling (3.17) of the linear multiplet to the anomalous u(1)x takes the form

here ck = q3

4c3 tr(ikv (0))l(k).

(3.40)

again the traces over the product of k with the gauge group generators can be calculated
and lead to the identication b(k,a)
3 = 2nxc3 sin(2kvx), exactly as
in the purely bosonic case, eq. (3.18).

= c2ck cos(2kva), b(k)

2

assuming a quadratic kahler potential for the twisted elds, we nd, in direct general-

ization of (3.29) and (3.33), that the eective theory describing the linear multiplets

ll = z d2d2  xk (cid:16)b1(l(k))2 + 4b(k)
tr( w (a) w (a)), d2l(k) = 2b(k,a)

(3.44)

the condition for gauge anomaly cancellation is therefore the same that was found in the
purely bosonic case (3.21).

let us now analyze the question which twisted elds can contribute to anomaly cancel-
lation. the twisted sectors with no xed planes are commonly denoted as n = 1 sectors
and the ones with xed planes as n = 2 sectors. as we saw in section 2, all the elds
from the n = 1 sectors are in n = 1 linear multiplets. the mechanism described above
works well for the elds from the n = 1 sectors. the twisted elds of the n = 2 sectors
t into n = 1 chiral and n = 2 hyper, linear hyper and vector-tensor multiplets. we can
think of the n = 2 sectors as follows.
if the k-th twisted sector has a xed plane, then
gcd(k, n) 6= 1. consider the z m orientifold, with m = n/ gcd(k, n), generated by k. this
leads to n = 2 supersymmetry in d = 4 (compare the discussion in footnote 2). in partic-
ular, the gauge elds are in n = 2 vector multiplets, the untwisted matter elds in hyper
multiplets and the twisted elds in hyper and vector-tensor multiplets. this constrains the
possible couplings. the projection on z n -invariant states eliminates some of the elds (e.g.
the the scalar partners of the gauge elds are projected out), but the remaining terms in
the lagrangian are inherited from the n = 2 theory. now, it is important to note that in
the n = 2 z m theory all of the twisted elds in linear multiplets belong to vector-tensor
multiplets. in the n = 1 zn theory some of the vectors are projected out, but their linear
partners still couple as required by n = 2 supersymmetry. in [29] it was shown that in an
n = 2 supersymmetric theory only elds belonging to vector multiplets can couple to the
gauge kinetic terms. therefore a coupling m (k) tr(w (a)w (a)) as in (3.42) is only possible
if one either has only n = 1 supersymmetry (i.e. no xed planes) or the m (k) belong to
n = 2 vectors, which means that their duals l(k) are in n = 2 vector-tensor multiplets.
we conclude, that besides the linear multiplets from the n = 1 sectors all the linear multi-
plets from the n = 2 sectors, but none of the chiral multiplets, can contribute to anomaly
cancellation. otherwise stated, elds from all twisted sectors except the k = n/2 sector can
contribute to anomaly cancellation.7 as we noted above these elds suce to cancel all the
u(1) anomalies in d = 4, n = 1 type iib orientifolds.

the kahler potential for the ti, k (t ) = pi ln(ti + ti), transforms as
k (t )  k (t ) + ln(iciti + di) + ln(ici ti + di),

(4.2)

i.e. the kinetic terms of the ti are not modied ((4.2) is a kahler transformation). at
one-loop one nds an anomalous variation of the lagrangian (3.36) [24, 25, 30]

however, the variation (4.3) is cancelled by an opposite variation of sdil like in the case of

u(1) gauge anomalies via exchange of twisted elds m (k). to cancel also the kahler anoma-

this shows that all kahler anomalies, except those associated to the third complex plane
in even n orientifolds, can indeed be cancelled by the mechanism proposed in [7]. whether
the crucial coupling coupling (4.9) indeed occurs and whether the coecients i
k really have
the required values, should be veried by an explicit string calculation.

there is good reason to believe that the couplings (4.9) are generated with the correct
coecients. in four-dimensional heterotic string vacua, there is an exact symmetry, called
t-duality, which acts on the moduli ti as the kahler transformation (4.1) but with integer
coecients ai, bi, ci, di. the green-schwarz mechanism guarantees that this symmetry is
preserved at the quantum level. because of heterotic-type i duality (see e.g. [33]) the same
should be true for type iib orientifolds. the type i moduli ti are dened by [16, 34]

ti =

r2
i
i + ic(2)2i+2,2i+3,

(4.21)

where ri is the radius of the i-th torus, c(2)i,j are the internal components of the ten-
dimensional rr 2-form and i = e is the ten-dimensional type i string coupling. under
the duality mapping given in [33] the type i ti are mapped to the heterotic ti, dened by
i / + ib2i+2,2i+3. the heterotic t-duality should therefore be realized as a symmetry
ti = r2
of four-dimensional type i vacua (and in particular of type iib orientifolds) acting on the
i=1 sl(2, z)i subgroup of (4.1). note that on the type i side, this

type i moduli ti as the q3

symmetry is not t-duality.9

if d5-branes are present in the considered orientifold, the above reasoning has to be
slightly modied. the eld strengths corresponding to the gauge elds living on the d5-
branes do not couple to sdil but rather to t3 (here we assume that the d5-branes are extended
in the four non-compact dimensions and in the third complex plane). the corresponding
term in the lagrangian is

z d2 t3 tr(w (a,5)w (a,5)) + h.c.

(4.22)

clearly, the sl(2, z)3 subgroup of (4.1) is explicitely broken by this coupling. therefore one
cannot expect the green-schwarz mechanism to work for the kahler symmetries associated
to the third complex plane if d5-branes are present. the existence of d5-branes in type

9t-duality in type i vacua exchanges dierent types of d-branes. from the t-duality rules derived in [34]
one sees that it also exchanges the three ti and the type i dilaton multiplet sdil. this is clearly dierent
from (4.1).

18

iib orientifolds is intimately linked to the existence of an order-two twist. if the considered
orientifold contains an order-two twist, then tadpole cancellation requires d5-branes that
are extended in the complex plane which is xed by this twist. thus, whenever a complex
plane is xed under the action of n/2, then the kahler symmetry associated to this plane
is explicitely broken.

there is a striking dierence between the cancellation of kahler anomalies in heterotic
and type i vacua. in the heterotic string, only the anomalies in the n = 1 sectors (i.e. the
sectors without xed planes) are cancelled by a green-schwarz mechanism. the anomalies
in the n = 2 sectors are cancelled by a ti dependent one-loop correction to the gauge kinetic
function. the authors of [35] calculated the one-loop correction f (1) to the gauge kinetic
function f (as dened in (b.1), see [36] for a pedagogical presentation) for d = 4, n = 1
heterotic orbifolds. they nd

f (1) = 1

because of the transformation property of the dedekind -function under (4.1), 2(iti)

in contrast to this, the gauge kinetic function of type i vacua can only depend linearly on
the ti [37]. this can be understood from the fact that the imaginary part of ti in eq. (4.21)
is a rr-eld, which leads to an invariance of the action under a peccei-quinn symmetry
ti  ti + iai. as a consequence, the mechanism for the cancellation of kahler anomalies in
the n = 2 sectors in type iib orientifolds must be dierent from the mechanism that achieves
anomaly cancellation in heterotic orbifolds. indeed, we saw abow that the generalized green-
schwarz mechanism also works in the n = 2 sectors of type iib orientifolds. the only
orientifold that has xed planes under a twist k, with k 6= n/2, is the z
6 orientifold. it
would therefore be interesting to obtain the coupling (4.9) for the k = 2 sector of z
6 from
an explicit string calculation to see if the green-schwarz mechanism works in the expected
way. if the kahler anomalies associated to the second complex plane of z
6 are cancelled
by the mechanism described above, then the complete sl(2, ir)2 symmetry is preserved at
the quantum level. this diers from the situation in the corresponding z
6 orbifold of the
heterotic string where the classical sl(2, ir)2 symmetry is broken to sl(2, z)2 by quantum
eects. presumably the sl(2, ir)2 of the z
6 orientifold is broken to its discrete subgroup by
some non-perturbative eect.

the authors of [7] nd that there are also mixed kahler-gravitational anomalies propor-
tional to the coecient bi
op. the rst contribution is from closed string modes
and the second from open string modes. it turns out that the open string contribution can
be cancelled by the twisted elds m (k) transforming as in (4.12). but the bi
cl contribution can
only be cancelled by a transformation of the type i dilaton sdil under kahler transformations:

5 fayet-iliopoulos terms

the generalized green-schwarz mechanism described in the preceeding sections cancels the
gauge and kahler anomalies, but it also gives mass to the gauge bosons (of the anomalous
u(1)s), thus breaking gauge invariance.
in addition, it generically leads to a non-trivial
contribution to the d-term of the (pseudo-)anomalous vector eld. this contribution is called
fayet-iliopoulos term and it induces non-vanishing vacuum expectation values for some of
the charged elds. (fayet-ilipoulos terms in type iib orientifolds have been discussed in
[38, 39].)

the lagrangian describing the interactions of the dilaton sdil, the untwisted moduli ti,
the twisted moduli m (k) and the gauge elds of type iib orientifolds is obtained from (4.11),

perfoming a t-duality transformation which interchanges d9-branes and d5-branes. this
yields b(a)

(5.7)

in most orientifold models there exist no elds which are charged under u(1)x but neutral
under the non-abelian gauge group factors. therefore a non-vanishing 2
fi implies a breaking
of the non-abelian gauge symmetry by the higgs eect. as noted in [39] this diers from the
situation in heterotic orbifolds, where non-abelian singlets charged under u(1)x generically
exist. a second dierence to heterotic vacua is the possibility of having a vanishing fayet-
iliopoulos in type iib orientifolds [6]. this is possible because of the dependence of 2
fi on the
expectation value of the twisted elds. for type i vacua that are obtained by compactifying
the ten-dimensional theory on a smooth calabi-yau manifold instead of an orientifold there
is no such dependence on twisted elds. indeed, it has been shown in [41] that the fayet-
iliopoulos in smooth type i vacua has exactly the same form as in heterotic vacua. it is

21

str/1922.
proportional to the universal anomaly coecient a and given by 2
comparing this to the result for orientifolds, we see that the anomaly coecient a is split
into a sum of contributions from the dierent twisted sectors, as in (3.21).

fi,cy = ag2m 2

if we insist on unbroken non-abelian gauge symmetry, then in most orientifold models

we must require 2
the simplest example of the z 3 orientifold, one has from (5.6)

fi = 0. this relates the expectation value of the m (k) to pi ln(ti + ti). in

m (1)| + m (1)| =

ln(ti| + ti|).

(5.8)

the blowing-up of the orientifold, however, is related to the expectation values of the lowest
components of the linear multiplets l(k). from the discussion in sections 3 and 4, it can
be seen that in terms of linear multiplets the fayet-iilopoulos term (5.2) is given by 2
fi =
b1 pk b(k)
 g
3 l(k)|. therefore, a vanishing fayet-iliopoulos term corresponds to the orientifold
limit.

6 conclusions and outlook

we have seen that the duality between linear and chiral multiplets provides an easy way to
understand anomaly cancellation in d = 4, n = 1 type iib orientifolds. due to the existence
of rr forms there appear antisymmetric tensors (embedded in linear supermultiplets) in the
twisted spectrum. their coupling to the gauge elds on the d-branes leads to a non-trivial
transformation under the (pseudo-)anomalous gauge symmetry of the scalars (embedded in
chiral supermultiplets) which are dual to these antisymmetric tensors. this transformation
cancels the anomaly. the crucial twist-number non-conserving couplings, which are not
present in heterotic orbifolds, are possible in type iib orientifolds because the corresponding
world-sheets have boundaries and/or are non-orientable.

it is interesting to compare type iib orientifolds to heterotic orbifolds. there are several
dierences, a better understanding of which could lead to deeper insights into heterotic-type
i duality [38, 39]. in d = 4, n = 1 heterotic orbifolds, u(1) gauge anomalies are cancelled
by a green-schwarz mechanism involving only one linear multiplet: the dilaton supereld.
this is possible because of the universal nature of the anomalies. the non-universality
of the anomalies in type iib orientifolds is accounted for by several linear multiplets that
contribute to anomaly cancellation. however their expectation values are not related to the
string loop expansion but rather to the blowing-up of the orbifold singularities. this has
interesting phenomenological implications. whereas in heterotic orbifolds the value of the
fayet-iliopoulos term is uniquely determined once the expectation value of the dilaton is
xed, the same term in type iib orientifolds depends on the expectation value of the twisted
moduli and can even vanish in the orientifold limit.

in heterotic orbifolds, the gauge kinetic function receives ti-dependent threshold correc-
tions from the n = 2 sectors. these are crucial to cancel the anomalies in the discrete kahler
symmetries associated to xed planes. from general arguments such ti-dependent thresh-
old corrections cannot exist in type iib orientifolds, because of a peccei-quinn symmetry

22

related to the ti [37]. as a consequence, the continuous sl(2, ir) kahler symmetries asso-
ciated to xed planes of type iib orientifolds are either completely broken by the anomaly
or completely preserved by the green-schwarz mechanism. in this article we showed that
the green-schwarz mechanism works even for the xed planes (which are not xed by an
order-two twist), but the precise coecients of the required couplings have to be determined
by an explicit calculation. a break-down of the continuous kahler symmetries to their dis-
in the n = 2 sectors of
crete subgroups seems to require some non-perturbative eect.
heterotic orbifolds there are additional gauge group independent corrections to the gauge
kinetic function [23, 42]. it would be interesting to see if such corrections are also present in
type iib orientifolds. by the argument given above, they can however only depend on the
ui but not on the ti to all orders in perturbation theory.

the twisted spectrum of some type iib orientifolds contains vector elds. the corre-
sponding gauge symmetry is inherited from the gauge invariance of the rr forms. but it is
not clear what is the role of this gauge symmetry in d = 4. in heterotic orbifolds this does
not happen. there, all twisted states are in chiral multiplets. unfortunately, no heterotic
dual is known for the z

6 or z 12 orientifolds, which possess twisted vectors.

where the gauge kinetic function f and the superpotential w are holomorphic functions of
i and the kahler potential k is an arbitrary real function. the component expansion of
i and v was given in (a.11), (a.12). expanding the lagrangian (b.1) in components (see
e.g. [32]),

(b.3)

we are interested in the case where one of the elds (say 0) appears as an axion like in
the green-schwarz mechanism and the other elds (i, i 6= 0) couple to v in the usual way,
(b.4)

k = k(0 + 0 + 4b3v, ie2qiv i),

f = f (0).

substituting into (b.2) we nd the component lagrangian [43]

l = k (cid:16)re(0)re(0) + (im(0) + 2b3a)(im(0) + 2b3a)(cid:17)

where a prime denotes the derivative with respect to 0 evaluated at v = 0 =  =  and an
index i on k or w denotes the derivative with respect to i. the equations of motion for
d now reads

comparison of (b.5) with a lagrangian of the form (3.10) relates f (0) to the gauge coupling
constant, g = f (h0i) 1
2 . to obtain the physical gauge elds, one has to rescale the vector
eld: v  gv .10 the vacuum expectation value of the rst term in the rescaled expression
for d, eq. (b.6), is called the fayet-iliopoulos term:

2
fi =

2b3k 

qre(f (h0i))

.

(b.7)

(the square indicates that it has mass dimension 2.) at the supersymmetric minimum
d vanishes, and therefore some of the charged elds acquire vacuum expectation values,
fi = re(f ) 1
2

another interesting fact is that (b.5) contains a mass term for the gauge elds. after

rescaling one nds

a =

re(f (h0i))

.

(b.8)

10more precisely, we write v = g v and express the whole lagrangian in terms of the physical eld v .
