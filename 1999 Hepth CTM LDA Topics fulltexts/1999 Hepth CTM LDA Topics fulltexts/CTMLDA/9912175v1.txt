abstract

we study dynamics of a probe p-brane and a test particle in the eld background of
fully localized solutions describing the source p-brane within the worldvolume of the
source domain wall. we nd that the probe dynamics in the background of the source
p-brane in one lower dimensions is not reproduced, indicating that p-branes within the
worldvolume of domain walls perhaps describe an exotic phase of p-branes in brane
worlds. we speculate therefore that a (p + 1)-brane where one of its longitudinal
directions is along the direction transverse to the domain wall is the right describtion
of the p-brane in the brane world with the expected properties.

1 introduction

recently, a lot of attention has been paid to the idea on non-compact compactication
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] since it was observed by randall and sundrum (rs) [8, 9, 10] that such
old idea modied by the modern brane language can be applied to solve the hierarchy
problem in particle physics. according to the rs model, our four-dimensional world
is regarded as being conned within a (non-dilatonic) domain wall. in the rs model,
the graviton kaluza-klein (kk) spectrum consists of a normalizable zero mode bound
state (identied as the four-dimensional massless graviton) and a continuum of massive
kk modes. because the continuum of massive kk modes is extremely suppressed,
newtons 1/r2 law of four-dimensional gravity is reproduces with the correction from
the massive kk modes being beyond the limit of current experimental precision.

in ref.

[11], it is found out that the rs model can be extended (with the exactly
same structure of graviton kk spectrum) to the dilatonic domain wall case if the
dilaton coupling parameter is suciently small. dilatonic generalization (where the
cosmological constant term in the action is multiplied by the dilaton factor) is a natural
generalization of the rs model and is particularly interesting, because most of the
massive and the gauged supergravity theories contain dilaton factor in the cosmological
constant term. (few of gauged supergravity theories that have cosmological constant
terms without dilaton factor and therefore admit the ads space as a solution are
those obtained by compactifying the eleven-dimensional supergravity on s4 or s7 and
the type-iib supergravity on s5.) it has been observed [12, 13, 14, 15] that all the
supersymmetric domain wall solutions that have so far been constructed within the ve-
dimensional gauged supergravity with non-dilatonic cosmological constant term have
the undesirable exponentially increasing warp factor, rather than the exponentially
decreasing warp factor (which enables nice trapping of gravity within the domain wall)
of the rs model. perhaps, the dilatonic generalization of the rs type model will
provide with the supersymmetric embedding into the gauged supergravity theories.
the dilatonic generalization also seems to be more desirable, because the most of the
domain wall solutions obtained by compactifying (intersecting) branes in string theories
are dilatonic. it is one of the purposes of this paper to elaborate more on the most of
possible dilatonic domain walls in string theories and gauged supergravity theories in
relation to the rs type model.

since it is observed [9] that four-dimensional gravity is recovered within the domain
wall of the rs model, it is of interest to study gravitating objects in domain walls
to see whether lower-dimensional physics (in the worldvolume the domain walls) is
reproduced. (previous related works are, for example, refs. [16, 17, 18, 19].) for this
purpose, fully localized solutions describing extreme branes within the worldvolume of
extreme domain walls are constructed in ref.
[11]. it is a purpose of this paper to

1

study dynamics of a probe p-brane and an uncharged test particle in such background.
unfortunately, the elds produced by such congurations have properties dierent
from those produced by the corresponding branes in one lower dimensions. so, it
seems that such localized solutions are not suitable for describing branes in lower-
dimensional world with the right expected properties. on the other hand, existence
of fully localized solutions where branes live within the worldvolume of domain walls
seems to indicate that (if the rs model is a correct description of nature) such solutions
may describe exotic phase of branes. we propose that the higher-dimensional origin
of p-branes in one lower dimensions (with the right expected properties in one lower
dimensions) should rather be identied as (p+1)-branes where one of their longitudinal
directions is along the direction transverse to the domain wall.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we summarize fully localized solution
[11] and elaborate on possible dilatonic domain wall solutions
constructed in ref.
in massive and gauged supergravity theories.
in section 3, we study dynamics of
a probe p-brane moving in the eld background of the source p-brane living in the
worldvolume of the d-dimensional source domain wall and compare it to the dynamics
in the background of the (d  1)-dimensional source p-brane. in section 4, we repeat
the similar analysis with a test particle moving in the same backgrounds.

2 dilatonic domain walls in supergravity theories

in this section, we discuss various extreme dilatonic domain wall solutions that occur
in supergravity and string theories and localized solutions describing extreme p-brane
within extreme dilatonic domain walls.

we begin by considering the following d-dimensional einstein-frame action for the
system of the graviton ge
 (,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1), the dilaton , the (p + 1)-form
potential with the eld strength fp+2 = dap+1 and the (d  1)-form potential ad1
with the eld strength fd = dad1:

where ap and a are respectively the dilaton coupling parameters for the (p + 1)-form
and the (d  1)-form potentials. through a poincare dualization, one can replace
fd with the cosmological constant , thereby the kinetic term for ad1 in the above
action is replaced by the cosmological constant term e2a.

the solution to the eld equations of the action (1) describing the extreme dilatonic
p-brane with the longitudinal coordinates w = (w1, ..., wp) within the worldvolume
of the extreme dilatonic domain wall with the longitudinal coordinates (w, x), where

the harmonic functions hp and h for the p-brane and the domain wall satisfy the
following coupled partial dierential equations:

and therefore are given by [20, 11]:

,

3(dp)8

6

h = 1 + q|y|,

where q in the harmonic function h is related to the cosmological constant term  as
 = 2q2/.

note, although derived from the eld equations of the action of the specic form (1)
with only metric, dilaton and form elds, the solution (2) with the harmonic functions
(4) generically describe any extreme single-charged p-brane within the worldvolume
of single-charged extreme domain wall in string theories, which has additional scalar
elds originated from the internal components of metric and form potentials.

first of all, when viewed as a solution to the eld equations of the action (1), the
parameters p and  of the solution (2) take the following forms determined by the
dilaton coupling parameter ap or a, as well as by p and d:

p =

(5)

and the consistency of the eld equations [21] or the no-force requirement [22] restricts
the dilaton coupling parameters to satisfy the following constraint:

aap =

4(p + 1)

(d  2)2 .

(6)

in general, for p-brane solutions in string theories in d < 10, there are additional
scalars associated with the internal components of the spacetime metric and form

3

potentials, in addition to the d-dimensional string theory dilaton (dened in terms of
the dilaton in ten dimensions and the determinant of the internal part of the metric),
and the kinetic terms for the form potentials are multiplied not only by the dilaton
(with an appropriate dilaton coupling parameter) but also by other scalars in some
cases. nevertheless, one can view the solution (2) as the metric ge
, d-dimensional
string theory dilaton  and form elds ap+1 and ad1 part of full supergravity solution
describing the bps p-brane within the bps domain wall in a d-dimensional string
theory 2.
in this case, the parameters p and  in the solution (2) are no longer
restricted to take the forms (5) determined by the dilaton coupling parameters, p and
d, and the dilaton coupling parameters ap and a are not constrained by the relation
(6). however, they take the forms determined by the type of charges that the solution
carries and the number n of constituent branes, which have the same magnitude of
charges.

to see this easily, we apply the weyl-scaling transformation ge

d2 g to the
solution (2).
in this new frame, the einstein term and the dilaton kinetic term of
the einstein-frame action (1) take the following string-frame form for a d-dimensional
eective string theory action:

 = e 4

1
22

d z ddge2 [rg + 4] .

(7)

this is the main reason why we choose to normalize the dilaton  to have the coecient
4/(d  2) in the dilaton kinetic term in the einstein-frame action (1) instead of the
in this string-frame, the spacetime metric for the
usual canonical choice of 1/2.
extreme p-brane solution takes the following form:

1 +    + dy2

(8)

by noting that in the kk compactication of string theories on any ricci-at manifolds
with the kk gauge elds set equal to zero the d-dimensional string-frame metric
g (,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1) is related to the ten-dimensional string-frame metric gm n
(m, n = 0, 1, ..., 9) as g = g, one can nd generic expressions for ap and p for
any p-brane solutions in string theory on any ricci-at compactication manifolds.
namely, one can determine ap and p for various cases by comparing the metric (8)
to the d-dimensional uncompactied part of the ten-dimensional string-frame metric

2of course, one can linearly combine scalar elds to bring the action to the form (1) with a single
dilatonic scalar, but for the convenience of identifying string theory dilaton in the solutions we shall
just regard the solution (2) as a part of full string theory solution, with  being regarded as the
d-dimensional string theory dilaton, rather than as a dilatonic scalar dened as a linear combination
of all the scalars.

4

for (intersecting) bps branes (with equal magnitudes of constituent branes). the
resulting general rules for determining values of the parameters ap and p in the p-
brane solutions in d-dimensional string theories on any ricci-at manifolds are as
follows:

 for a p-brane made out of n constituent branes, p = 4/n.
 for a p-brane made out of n constituent branes of the same type of charges
with the same magnitude, the values of the dilaton coupling parameter ap are as
follows:

ap = d2p4
,
ap = 2(dp3)
d2
ap =  2(p+1)
d2 ,

, originated from intersecting ns5-branes

 for a d-dimensional p-brane made out of ni numbers of type i branes, where i
stands for d-brane, ns5-brane or the fundamental string, with the same magni-
tude of charges, the dilaton coupling parameter ap is the weighted average of the
dilaton coupling parameters ai

p of each type of constituent, namely,

where the expression for ai

p for each case is given in the previous item.

(9)

the domain wall solutions in string theories can be constructed [23, 24, 25, 26]
through the ordinary compactication of (intersecting) branes (with the same magni-
tudes of charges for the constituent branes) on a ricci at manifold combined with
the scherk-schwarz compactication [27], which leads to the massive supergravity the-
ories with the cosmological constant term. for such compactication, the parameters
 and a in the domain wall solution take the forms corresponding to the p = d  2
case of the bps p-brane solutions discussed in the previous paragraph. namely, the
ordinary compactication on a ricci-at manifold combined with the scherk-schwarz
compactication leads to the domain wall solutions with  = 4/n > 0 (n  z+),
only. on the other hand, the domain wall solutions of the massive supergravity the-
ories which cannot be obtained through the scherk-schwarz type compactications of
the eleven- or ten-dimensional supergravity theory have  6= 4/n. (generally, such
domain wall solutions typically have  < 0.) some of such massive supergravity theo-
ries in d < 10 can be constructed through the freund-rubin compactication [28] of
supergravity theories in d = 10, 11 on spheres. (it is also pointed out in ref. [11] that

5

the combined scherk-schwarz type and spherical compactication 3 of (intersecting)
branes (with the equal magnitudes of the constituent brane charges) leads to dilatonic
[31, 32, 33, 34].) exam-
domain wall solutions with  6= 4/n, constructed in refs.
ples are gauged supergravities in d = 7 [35], d = 6 [36, 37] and d = 5 [38], and
the su(2)  su(2) gauged supergravity in d = 4 [39], whose domain wall solutions
all have  = 2. for example, the domain wall solutions of the gauged supergrav-
ity in d = 7 [35] [of the su(2)  su(2) gauged supergravity in d = 4 [39]] can be
obtained by starting from the intersecting two ns5-branes on a line and then compact-
ifying on s3 [on s3  s3] in the near horizon region of one of the ns5-branes and far
away from the other ns5-brane [in the near horizon of both of the ns5-branes] [30].
these exceptional cases are particularly interesting, because domain wall solutions in
gauged supergravity theories (sometimes constructible through the spherical compact-
ications of branes in string theories) provide with dilatonic generalization [11] of the
rs model [8, 9, 10]. although it is found out [11] that dilatonic domain walls with
 < 2 have the kk graviton spectrum similar to that of the rs domain wall solution,
thereby leading to the generalization of the rs model to the dilatonic domain walls
with  < 2, it may turn out that even in the  < 0 case the boundary condition
on the wave function at the location of the domain wall (due to the -function po-
tential in the schrodinger equation) excludes undesirable non-zero mode kk states to
reproduce lower-dimensional gravity with extremely suppressed contribution from the
non-zero graviton kk modes. to sum up, in order to construct domain wall solutions
in string theories which generalize the rs model and supergravity solutions describing
branes in such domain walls, one starts with (intersecting) branes in string theories
and applies the freund-rubin compactication on spheres, along with the ordinary
kk compactication when necessary.

3 dynamics of a probe p-brane

in this section, we study dynamics of a probe p-brane moving in the background (2) of
the source p-brane living in the brane world, comparing with the dynamics of a probe
p-brane moving in the following (d  1)-dimensional source p-brane background:

3in the spherical compactications of branes, one goes to the near horizon region of the (inter-
secting) branes and compacties all the angular coordinates of the (overall) transverse space in the
spherical coordinates on a sphere. so, (intersecting) branes can be interpreted as interpolating be-
tween the minkowski vacuum (at innity) and the vacuum of gauged supergravity theory (in the near
horizon region) [29, 30].

(13)

where the target space elds ge
,  and a1...p+1 are the background elds (produced
by the source brane) in which the probe p-brane with the target space coordinates x 
( = 0, 1, ..., d  1) and the worldvolume coordinates a (a = 0, 1, ..., p) moves. note,
the scalar  in the above is not the string theory dilaton, but is a linear combination
of all the nontrivial scalars of the solution.

in the static gauge, in which x a = a, the pull-back elds for the probe p-brane,

oriented in the same way as the source p-brane, take the following forms:

gab  ge

ax bx  = ge

ab + ge

ij ax ibx j,

aa1...ap+1  a1...p+1a1x 1...ap+1x p+1 = aa1...ap+1,

(14)

where the indices i, j = 1, ..., d p 1 label the transverse space of the probe p-brane,
i.e., (x i) = (x1, ..., xdp2, y) in the notation of eq. (2). so, the worldvolume action
(13) takes the following form:

s = tpz dp+1"eaprdet(cid:16)ge

ab + ge

ijax ibx j(cid:17) + a01...p# .

(15)

from now on, we assume that the target space transverse coordinates x i for the probe
p-brane depend on the time coordinate  = 0 only, i.e., x i = x i( ).

in the target space background (2) of the extreme p-brane localized within the do-

main wall, the probe p-brane action (15) takes the following form:

s = tpz dp+1

(17)

and we used eqs. (5) and (6), which hold for the dilatonic brane solution (2) to the eld
equations of the action (1), to simplify the expression. for the source-probe method to
be valid, one has to assume that the source brane is much heavier than the probe brane
so that the backreaction of the probe brane to the source brane can be negligible. so,
the constant term in the harmonic function for the source p-brane can be neglected.
one further assumes that the velocity of the probe p-brane is very small (vk  0  v)
and changes very slowly so that the radiation will be negligible, allowing quasistatic
evolution of the system described by the geodesic motion in the moduli space. in this
limit, the probe action (16) is approximated to

(18)

where mp is the mass of the probe p-brane given by the product of the probe p-brane
tension tp and the volume factor resulting from the integration with respect to a
(a = 1, ..., p). so, one can see that the motion of the probe p-brane in the background
(2) is given by the geodesic motion in the moduli space with the following moduli
metric:

(19)

the probe action and the moduli metric for a probe p-brane moving in the background
(10) of the (d  1)-dimensional source p-brane are also given by eqs. (18) and (19)
with h = 1 and hp given in eq. (11).

for the motion of the probe in the x-direction, we set all the angular momenta of
the probe except one equal to zero. (the motion of the probe for the case with more
than one non-zero angular momenta will be qualitatively the same.) introducing the
polar coordinates (x, k) in the rotation plane associated with the non-zero angular
momentum jk, one can express the velocity of the probe in the x-direction as v2
k =
x2 + x2 2
k, where the dot denotes dierentiation with respect to the time coordinate
 . then, the canonical momenta pk and p along the x and y direction, the angular
momentum jk and the energy e of the probe p-brane are as follows:

(20)

note, when the motion of the probe is conned along the domain wall worldvolume
direction, i.e. v = 0, the probe p-brane action (16) is independent of the harmonic

8

function h for the domain wall, and therefore has the same form as that of a probe
p-brane in the background (10) of the (d  1)-dimensional source p-brane. however,
the harmonic function hp for the source p-brane within the d-dimensional domain wall
has non-trivial modication due to the presence of the domain wall. this implies that
the probe p-brane can distinguish between a (d  1)-dimensional p-brane (without a
domain wall) and a p-brane within a d-dimensional domain wall. also, unfortunate
and unexpected situation is that the harmonic function hp for the source p-brane in
(4) has the radial dependence of the form hp  |x|(dp8/3) when restricted
eq.
to the domain wall worldvolume directions (i.e., y =constant), rather than the usual
 |x|(dp4) dependence of a typical p-brane in d  1 dimensions. note, the latter
dependence was expected because domain walls with suitable forms of warp factors are
shown to eectively compactify the d-dimensional gravity to the (d  1)-dimensional
one through gravitational trapping [9], even if the space along the transverse direction
of the domain walls is non-compact.

on the other hand, recently it is observed that unlike the case of the kk modes of
the graviton, the kk zero mode of a massless u(1) gauge boson is not localized on
the lower-dimensional hypersurface of a domain wall but rather spreads over the extra
dimensions [40] and the massive kk modes couple to elds on the boundary (at the
wall) a lot more strongly than the zero mode [41, 40]. (we also expect that such exotic
properties of the kk modes also hold for the generalization of a u(1) gauge eld, i.e. a
(p + 1)-form potential, which a p-brane couples to.) note, in such works, it is assumed
that the u(1) gauge eld does not modify spacetime, ignoring the backreaction of
the u(1) eld to the domain wall spacetime and therefore the domain wall spacetime
providing with the static xed background in which the u(1) eld lives. however,
when the u(1) charge becomes large enough for its gravitational backreaction to the
domain wall spacetime to be non-negligible, such unusual properties of the u(1) gauge
eld kk spectrum will manifest in the reissner-nordstrom black hole (which is just
a spherically symmetric gravitating object with non-zero u(1) charge) in one lower
dimensions. we believe that this is the main reason for the above mentioned unusual
dependence of the p-brane harmonic function on the radial coordinate. so, the solution
(2) may correctly describe a p-brane in one lower dimensions whose higher-dimensional
origin is a p-brane living inside of the domain wall worldvolume, and the existence of
such p-branes with such unusual radial dependence of elds in our world may provide
with an evidence that our world is embedded inside of the domain wall.

therefore, a charged p-brane in a (d  1)-dimensional world (embedded in a d-
dimensional domain wall) with the expected radial dependence might have to be re-
garded as a (p + 1)-brane in d dimensions where one of its longitudinal directions is
along the transverse direction of the domain wall. (so, in particular, a massless u(1)
eld in the brane world might have to be regarded as a two-form potential in one higher

9

dimensions.) the conguration is given in the following table.

brane
domain wall

t

y


here, t is the time coordinate, w = (w1, ..., wp) and y are the longitudinal coordinates
of the (p + 1)-brane, and w and x = (x1, ..., xdp2) are the longitudinal coordinates of
the domain wall. this point of view is also taken in ref. [16], where it is argued that
the schwarzschild black hole in four-dimensional world within a domain wall should be
regarded as a black string in ve dimensions. in fact, since the harmonic function for
such (p + 1)-brane is a harmonic function in a (d  p  2)-dimensional (conformally)
at space with the coordinate x, the harmonic function for the p-brane in one lower
dimensions will have the expected radial dependence  |x|(dp4).

before we will construct such solutions in our future work, it would be of interest to
check the existence of such solutions and nd out about the constraint on the dilaton
coupling parameters by analyzing the no-force condition [22] on the probe (p+1)-brane
in the background of the source domain wall with the conguration given in the above
table. the worldvolume action for the probe (p + 1)-brane in the background of the
domain wall is

s = tp+1z dp+2eap+1rdet(cid:16)ge

ab + ge

ij ax ibx j(cid:17),

(21)

where  and ge
 are the elds produced by the source domain wall and the wess-
zumino term does not contribute in this case. by expanding the action (21) in powers
of derivatives of x i, one obtains the following eective static potential on the probe:

v = eap+1qge

tt ge

so, the force between the probe and the source is balanced, when the following con-
straint on the dilaton coupling parameters is satised:

aap+1 =

4(d + p)

(d  2)2 .

(23)

in particular, such conguration is not possible for the non-dilatonic domain walls
(a = 0), just like the case of the p-brane within the domain worldvolume 4.

in the following subsections, we analyze the geodesic motion of the probe p-brane
along the domain wall (v = 0) and perpendicularly to the domain wall (vk = 0),
separately.

4this is one of the reasons why we considered dilatonic domain walls in our previous work [11].

3.1 the motion of the probe along the domain wall

in this subsection, we study the dynamics of the probe p-brane along the direction x
transverse to the source p-brane but is conned to the worldvolume directions of the
domain wall. in this case, v = 0, i.e., the overall transverse coordinate z is constant
in time. we also study the dynamics of a probe p-brane moving in the background
(10) of the (d  1)-dimensional source p-brane for the purpose of comparison with the
former case.

where the source p-brane harmonic function is hp  qp/hx2 + 4
for the former case and hp  qp/xdp4 for the latter case. for the incoming probe
p-brane with the asymptotic velocity v and the impact parameter b, the asymptotic
values (at innite distance from the wall) of the dynamic quantities are e = mpv2/2,
pk = mpv and jk = bmpv. the geodesic motion of such probe p-brane is then described
by the following probe velocity x along the radial direction x, obtained by solving (24):

first, we consider the motion in the background (10) of the (d  1)-dimensional
source p-brane. there exists the critical value of n  (d  p  4)(4  p)/p below
and above which the motion of the probe is qualitatively dierent. when n < 2, the
probe will approach the source with decreasing speed, stop at the turning point x =
xc = (b2/q(4p)/p
)1/(2n), and re-emerge. when n = 2, the probe will approach the
source monotonically and be ultimately captured by the source, as long as q(4p)/p
>
b2. when n < 2, the radial motion of the probe is the conned within the interval
)1/(n2) is the turning point, and the probe
0  x  xc, where xc = (b2/q(4p)/p
will be in the end captured by the source. on the other hand, for the motion in the
background (2) of the source p-brane living in the worldvolume of the source domain
wall, the probe will never be captured by the source. when n  3(dp)8
< 1,
the probe will approach the source with decreasing speed, stop at the turning point
and be scattered away. when n > 1, the radial motion of the probe will be conned
to the nite interval away from the source, for suitable values of parameters.

3.2 the motion of the probe perpendicularly to the domain

wall

for the motion of the probe in the direction perpendicular to the domain wall, we just
consider the background without the source p-brane for the purpose of seeing whether
the domain wall will trap the p-brane. in this case, the probe p-brane action is given
by eq. (16) with hp = 1 and vk = 0. therefore, the energy e of the probe p-brane is

e =

mp
1  h

(26)

from which we can obtain the following speed of the probe in the direction perpendicular
to the wall:

and the eective potential on the probe:

(27)

(28)

so, the velocity of the probe will never be zero at the domain wall (located at y = 0), if
e > mp. when  > 0, in which case the matter is trapped but the gravity is not, the
probe p-brane will approach the domain wall with increasing speed and pass through
the wall and slow down, approaching zero velocity asymptotically, implying that the
domain wall attracts the probe p-brane. when  < 0, in which case the matter is not
trapped, as the probe approaches the domain wall, its speed decreases, and after the
probe passes through the wall its speed will increase, implying that the domain wall
repels the probe p-brane.

4 dynamics of a test particle

in this section, we study the dynamics of an uncharged test particle in the background
(2) of the source p-brane living inside of the d-dimensional domain wall and in the
background (10) of the source p-brane in d  1 dimensions. since one of the main
purposes of such study is to compare the dynamics in these two backgrounds, we shall
be interested in the motion along the direction x transverse to the source p-brane and
restricted to the worldvolume directions of the domain wall.

generally, the motion of a test particle under the inuence of the gravitational eld

g is described by the geodesic equation

(29)

where 
 is the christoel symbol for the metric g and x() is the geodesic path
of the test particle parameterized by an ane parameter . one can avoid having to
solve these complicated coupled equations by utilizing the symmetry of spacetime in
which the test particle moves. for each killing vector k  of spacetime, one can dene a
constant of motion of the test particle by contracting it with the velocity u  = dx/d
of the test particle along the geodesic path x(). for the metrics under consideration
in this section, the killing vectors /t, /wi and /m give rise to the following
constants of motion for the test particle:

e = ge
pi = ge

(30)

where the angular coordinates 0  m < 2 (m = 1, ..., [(d  p  2)/2]) are associated
with [(dp2)/2] rotation planes in (dp2)-dimensional space with the coordinates
x. in addition, there is another constant of motion associated with metric compatibility
along the geodesic path:

 = ge



dx
d

(31)

where  = +1, 0,1 respectively for a massive particle (i.e. a timelike geodesic), a
massless particle (i.e. a null geodesic) and a spacelike geodesic (even though it does
not correspond to the physical path of a particle).

for the test particle moving along the x-direction, i.e., only the x-component of u 
is non-zero, the geodesic motion is described by the following probe velocity along the
radial direction x resulting from solving eqs. (30) and (31):

=

where  = 1, 0 for a massive and a massless test particle and the index m is summed
over m = 1, ..., [(d p 2)/2]. by plugging the explicit expressions for the background
metrics of the source branes into the above general expression, we obtain

for the source p-brane in the d-dimensional domain wall with hp given in eq. (4).
note, the domain wall harmonic function h is just a constant since we consider the
motion along the longitudinal directions of the domain wall. here, j is dened in
terms of the conserved angular momenta j m of the test particle as

j 2 

[ dp2

m

(35)

where m (whose explicit expressions are given in ref. [42]) are the direction cosines
specifying the direction of r and are constant due to conservation of the direction
of angular momentum (therefore j is also constant). by inspecting the expressions
(33) and (34) for the probe velocities, one can see the following properties for the
test particles motion. first of all, the asymptotic velocity of the test particle, as it
approaches the p-brane, is always non-zero and nite for the background (2) of p-brane
in the d-dimensional domain wall, but is either zero or innite for the background (10)
of (d1)-dimensional p-brane. the massless test particle ( = 0) will always approach
the p-brane. but for the massive test particle ( = 1), whereas the test particle in the
background (10) will always approach the p-brane, the test particle in the background
(2) can be scattered away at nite distance from the p-brane for suitable values of the
parameters.

for the completeness, we just write down the equation describing geodesic motion
of a test particle along the y-direction in the background of the source p-brane living
inside of the domain wall, although it seems hard to solve the equation to obtain the
expression for the geodesic path. this can be achieved by considering the geodesic
equation (29) and eq. (31) with only y-component of u  non-zero, resulting in the
following equation:
