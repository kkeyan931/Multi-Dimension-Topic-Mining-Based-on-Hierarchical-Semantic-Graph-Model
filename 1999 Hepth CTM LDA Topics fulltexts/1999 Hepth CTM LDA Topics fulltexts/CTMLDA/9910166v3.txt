abstract

following our earlier investigations we examine the quantumclassical wind-

ing number transition in the abelian-higgs system. it is demonstrated that

the winding number transition in this system is of the smooth second order

type in the full range of parameter space. comparison of the action of classical

vortices with that of the sphaleron supports our nding.

recently much attention has been paid to the decay-rate transition between the low-

temperature instanton-dominated quantum tunneling regime and the high-temperature

sphaleron-dominated thermal activity regime in quantum mechanics [1,2], in eld theo-

retical and gauge models [36], and in cosmology [79]. in particular the winding number

transitions in gauge theories are too complicated to handle analytically, and hence most cal-

culations of this type rely on numerical simulation with the help of computers. it is, however,

usually dicult to obtain a good physical insight from numerical calculations alone. hence,

it is important to develop alternative methods which enable one to extend the analytical

approach as far as possible. investigations along these directions were developed recently

by using nonlinear perturbation theory [10] or by counting the number of negative modes

of the full hessian around the sphaleron conguration [11]. although these two methods

start from completely dierent points of view, they both yield the same criterion for a sharp

rst-order transition in the scalar eld theories. since the explicit form of the criterion is

model-dependent, it is better to explain briey how the criterion is derived at this stage. let

u0 and 0 be eigenfunction and eigenvalue of the negative mode of the uctuation operator

h around sphaleron. therefore, the sphaleron frequency sph is dened as sph  0.

then the type of the transition is determined by computing the nonlinear corrections to

the frequency. let, for example,  be a frequency involving the nonlinear corrections. if

sph   < 0, the energy dependence of the period of the periodic instanton becomes a
nonmonotonic function. this is easily conjectured from the fact that the energy-dependence

of the period exhibits the increasing and decreasing behaviours near the sphaleron and vac-

uum instanton. from this conjecture and the relation ds/d = e where s,  , and e are

classical action, period, and energy respectively, one can imagine that the temperature de-

pendence of instanton action consists of monotonically decreasing and increasing parts when

sph   < 0 [12], which results in the discontinuity in the derivative of action with respect
to temperature and hence, generates the sharp rst-order transition. this is the main idea

of ref. [4,10].

some applications of this criterion to condensed matter physics [10,13,14], eld the-

oretical but non-gauge models [4,15], and cosmology [9,16] verify that this is physically

reasonable. however, the usefulness of such a criterion in the case of gauge theories is not

clear without an application in a specic model. this is clearly desirable since the winding

number transitions in gauge theories imply additional complications such as gauge xing

2

procedure and it is important to understand the implication of those in physical phenomena

such as baryon- and lepton-number violating processes.

in order to obtain some insight into such transitions at higher temperatures, the criterion

is here applied to the abelianhiggs model, which may be the simplest model among the

gauge theories which support both vacuum instanton and sphaleron congurations.

we start with the euclidean action of the d = 2 abelian-higgs model:

se = z d dx"1

4

ff + (d)d + [|  |2 

v2
2

]2#

(1)

where f = a  a and d =   iga.

it is well-known that action (1) is mathematically equivalent to ginzburg-landau theory

[17] and supports a vortex solution [18] as a zero temperature solution. the temperature

dependence of the classical action for the periodic solution in this model is calculated in ref.

[19] using some special numerical techniques. the nal numerical result of ref. [19] shows

that the winding number phase transition in this model is of the smooth second-order type
in the range of 1/4 < mh/mw < 4, where mh = 2v and mw = gv. in this paper we
will follow the method developed in ref. [4] and show that the type of the transition does

not change over the full range of parameter space, i.e.

it is always of the smooth second

order type.

the static solutions for the action (1) whose eld equations are

f = ig [(d)  (d)]
dd = 2(|  |2 

v2
2

),

can be easily obtained:

asph

0 = asph

1 = 0
v
2

tanhs 

2

sph =

vx.

(2)

(3)

in order to prove that (asph

0

, asph

1

, sph) are genuine sphaleron congurations in this model,

we introduce a non-contractible loop [2022]

3

a0 = a1 = 0
 = eis" v
2

cos s + ih(x) sin s#

(4)

where s is a loop parameter dened in the region 0  s  . note that  becomes a
in addition, the minimizing condition of energy
trivial vacuum at the end points of s.

e(, a) = r dxle, where le is euclidean lagrangian density in eq.(1), makes h(x) to be

h(x) =

(5)

tanh

v
2

sin ss 

2

vx
 .

hence, h(x) coincides with sph when s = /2. it is easy to show that the energy along the

minimal energy loop has a maximum at s = /2, which proves that (asph

0

, asph

1

, sph) are

sphaleron conguration.

chern-simons number at  = 0 in this model is dened as

ncs =

1

v2 z 0



d z 



dx

where the generalized chern-simons current  is

 =  "id 

g2v2

2

a# .

(6)

(7)

in fact,  is a lower bound of le when g = 2. to compute ncs along the loop, we treat
the loop parameter as an euclidean time-dependent quantity s = s( ) with s( = ) = 0,
s( = ) = , and s( = 0) = s0. then it is straightforward to show that ncs along the
loop is

ncs =

s0
 

sin 2s0

2

.

(8)

hence, the sphaleron conguration(s0 = /2) has half-integer chern-simons number

whereas the trivial vacuum(s0 = 0, ) has integer one, which allows us to interpret the

sphaleron as a classical solution sitting at the top of the barrier separating the topologically

distinct vacua. the classical action corresponding to that of the sphaleron is easily shown

to be

4

ssph =

esph
tsph

where tsph, the inverse of the sphaleron period, is interpreted as a temperature and

esph =

22

3

v3

(9)

(10)

which is interpreted as the barrier height. since the sphaleron is a static solution, one may

wonder how to dene the sphaleron period or frequency. in fact, the sphaleron frequency

is dened by using a periodic instanton solution p i(, x; e) which is a time-dependent

solution of the euclidean eld equation (2) in the full range of energy 0 < e < esph.

since it is well known that p i(, x; e = 0) and p i(, x; e = esph) coincide with vacuum

instanton and sphaleron respectively, we dene the sphaleron frequency is frequency of

limeesph p i(, x; e).

in order to be able to examine the type of quantum-classical transition we have to

introduce the uctuation elds around the sphaleron and expand eld equations up to the

third order in these elds. if, however, one expands eq.(2) naively, one will realize that the

uctuation operators are not diagonalized and, hence, the spectra of these operators are not

obtainable analytically. to solve this problem we x a gauge as a r gauge [23,24] by adding

as gauge xing term

sgf =

1

2 z d dx(cid:20)a +

ig
2

(2  2)(cid:21)2

to the original action (1). then, the eld equations are slightly changed to

f +

1


[a + ig(  )] = ig [(d)  (d)]

dd + ig"a +

ig
2

(2  2)# = 2(|  |2 

v2
2

).

(11)

(12)

it is easy to show that the sphaleron solution (3) and the corresponding action (9) are not

changed under the r gauge.

we now introduce the uctuation elds around the sphaleron as follows:

the spatial parts of the uctuation operators ha0, h+, h, and h1 are various kinds of

poschl-teller type operators whose spectra are summarized in ref. [25]. it is easy to show

that the spectra of ha0 and h+ consist of only positive modes whose explicit forms are

not necessary for further study. what we need are only the negative mode of h whose

eigenfunction ()

1 and eigenvalue ()

1 are

()

()
1 = s1  1,

(2s1 + 3)

(s1 + 1)(s1 + 2)

,

(21)

and the full spectrum of h1, which is summarized in table i. it is easy to show that the

zero mode (1)

0

in table i is propotional to sph/z1, which indicates the translational

symmetry of the abelian-higgs system.

now, we have to carry out the perturbation to derive the criterion for the sharp rst

order transition as suggested in ref. [10,14]. since l and h in eq. (17) are expressed in a

matrix form, it is impossible to use the criterion derived in ref. [10,14] directly. in this case

we have to repeat the perturbation procedure with a spectrum of the full spatial uctuation

operator h as suggested in ref. [4]. computing the nonlinear corrections of the sphaleron

frequency  perturbatively, one can derive the nal result of the criterion for the sharp

rst-order transition in this model as a following inequality:

7

i1(, v) + i2(, v) + i3(, v) < 0

where

i1(, v) = < ()

1 >,

1 >,

1 (z1) | d(1)
1 (z1) | d(2)
1 (z1) | d(3)

1 > .

i2(, v) = < ()

i3(, v) = < ()

(22)

(23)

here d(1)

1 (z1), d(2)

1 (z1), and d(3)

1 (z1) are given in the appendix (a.2). since tsph in eq. (9)

is the inverse of the sphaleron period, the action of the sphaleron becomes

ssph =

8

3s1 + 1

v2.

(24)

in deriving ssph in eq. (24) one has to use the rescaling denition of space-time variables
(14) and sph = s1 + 1 which is given in the appendix.

now, in order to compute d(i)

1 (z1)

i = 1, 2, 3 we are in a position to compute g1,1(z1)

and g1,2(z1) explicitly which is given in the appendix (a.3). the function g1,1(z1) is ex-

plicitly derived as follows. we dene

q1(z1)  h1

1

sinh z1

cosh2s1+3 z1

or equivalently

h1q1(z1) =

sinh z1

cosh2s1+3 z1

.

(25)

multiplying the zero mode of h1 with eq. (25), integrating over z1 from  to z1, and
performing partial integration twice, we can obtain the rst-order dierential equation for

q1(z1). solving this dierential equation one can obtain q1(z1) up to the constant of inte-

gration. this constant is determined by the fact that q1(z1) does not have a zero mode

component. inserting q1(z1) into g1,1(z1) one can derive the explicit form of g1,1(z1) which

is

g1,1(z1) =

1

(s1  1

2)(s1 + 1)(s1 + 1

(s1 + 1)

next we dene

u(z1) = z z1

q2(z1)  (cid:16)h1 + 42

sph(cid:17)1

now the computation of i1(, v), i2(, v), and i3(, v) is straightforward and their nal

form is given in the appendix (a.4). it is very interesting that i1(, v) and i2(, v) vanish
at s1 = 1/2 or, in terms of , at  = 3/2.

the -dependence of i1(, v), i2(, v), i3(, v), and i1(, v) + i2(, v) + i3(, v) is shown

in fig. 1 which shows that the condition for the sharp rst-order transition, i.e. (22), does

9

not hold when  < 4. ploting i1(, v) + i2(, v) + i3(, v) in the range of large , one can

conrm numerically that it is a monotonically increasing function which indicates that the

sharp rst-order transition does not occur in the full range of parameter space. this means

the winding number phase transition of this model is always smooth second-order as shown

in ref. [19], where same conclusion was derived by numerical method in the restricted region

of parameter space.

there is another indirect method which conrms our conclusion.

if the transition is

second order and there is no interaction between vacuum instanton and anti-instanton, the

condition

2s1 > ssph,

(32)

where s1 is the action of one instanton solution, has to be satised. since there is no

interaction between vortices at the bogomolnyi limit [26,27] which is  = 2 in this model,

we can use the condition (32) to check the credibility of our conjecture. since s1 = v2 in

this limit, it is easy to show that

ssph
2s1

= 0.833 < 1

(33)

which supports our conclusion.

in general, there is an interaction between vortices and hence, the condition (32) has to

be modied to

s2 > ssph,

(34)

where s2 is action of two interacting vortices, at arbitrary . s1 and s2 at arbitrary  can be

computed numerically by employing the variation method [28]. s1, s2 and ssph at various 

are summarized at table ii, which also conrms our nding at 0 <  < 4.

we hope our method can be applicable to the su(2)-higgs model which is most impor-

tant to understand the baryon-number violating process. the approach along this direction

is under investigation.
