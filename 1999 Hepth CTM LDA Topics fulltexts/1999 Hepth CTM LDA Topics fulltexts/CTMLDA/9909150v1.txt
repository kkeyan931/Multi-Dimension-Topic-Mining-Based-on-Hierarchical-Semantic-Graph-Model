abstract

we give a complete set of generators for the discrete exceptional u-duality groups of
toroidal compactied type ii theory and m-theory in d  3. for this, we use the dsz
quantization in d = 4 as originally proposed by hull and townsend, and determine the
discrete groups inducing integer shifts on the charge lattice. we then extend a method
suggested by the above authors and used by sen for the heterotic string to get the discrete
u-duality group in d = 3, thereby obtaining a quantized symmetry in d = 3 from a d = 4
quantization condition. this method is also studied in a toy model corresponding to d = 5
simple supergravity, which turns out to give a signicantly dierent result, even though
it can be identied with a truncation of m-theory. we illustrate the compactication to
d = 3 by an embedding of d = 4 particle multiplets into the d = 3 theory.

1 introduction and motivation

the study of nonperturbative duality symmetries in the last years has dramatically
changed our understanding of string theory. the ve perturbative string theories in

ten dimensions are now understood as dierent limits of a unied eleven dimensional
theory, called m-theory, with a web of duality symmetries connecting them [1, 2]. since

these symmetries act on the string coupling constant, they are dicult to test. nonethe-
less, several quantities protected by supersymmetry admit such tests, such as bps masses

and spectra as well as bps saturated amplitudes. since the nal form of a quantized
m-theory is not yet known, most tests use the low-energy eective limit, which is eleven
dimensional supergravity. global quantum symmetries in this limit should extend to a

fully quantized theory.

one of these nonperturbative dualities is the u-duality of toroidially compactied type

ii string theory, introduced in [3]. it was conjectured that this symmetry is generated by
the perturbative target space duality (for a review see [4]) and the strong-weak coupling

duality [5] of the type ii string [6] that do not commute, a phenomenon rst discovered
in [8]. for compactications on the torus td of type ii string theory, the target space
duality group corresponds to so(10  d, 10  d; z), while the s-duality of the type iib
theory acts as a sl(2, z) group. the proposed u-duality group is then generated by

g(z) = sl(2, z)  so(d, d; z).

(1)

the type iib s-duality was interpreted as the modular group of the torus in the tenth
and eleventh direction of m-theory [6, 7, 2]. for compactications of m-theory on td+1,
the modular group of the d + 1-torus is sl(d + 1, z), containing the above sl(2, z) as a
subgroup. therefore, rather than (1), the denition

g(z) = sl(d + 1, z)  so(d, d; z)

(2)

may be adopted.

the discussion of u-duality has led to identify nonperturbative states in string theory

with higher dimensional branes wrapping on the internal torus [3], as well as to include d-
branes into the theory (see [10] for a review), improving dramatically our understanding

of nonperturbative phenomena in string theory. solitons of string theory corresponding
to black hole solutions with regular horizon have made a microscopic interpretation of

black hole entropy possible (see [11] and [12] for a review). the entropy is known to be
given by invariants of the u-duality group.

1

in this context, the search for most general bps black hole solutions has been impor-

tant ([13], see [14], [15] for recent reviews).

u-duality, rephrased in an algebraic language [16], has also been used in the innite
momentum frame of matrix theory, predicting bps states for compactications not yet

accessible to matrix theory and new mysterious states especially for compactications
to three dimensions. u-duality extends to a generalized electric-magnetic duality of the
super-ym theory. upon inclusion of the lightlike momentum on the m-theory circle, the

group was even proposed to be extended by rank, see [17] for a review and references
therein.

in [17], a recent review was given on u-duality in diverse dimensions. the denition
(2) was used for an algebraic denition of the u-duality group and was applied to study

bps spectra in diverse dimensions, to generate u-duality invariant mass formulae and to
study r4 corrections to type ii theory as well as the implications on matrix theory.

in this paper, we give generators for the discrete u-duality in four dimensions, thereby
determining higher dimensional u-dualities as well, and apply these for a denition of
u-duality in d = 3. rather than using the string inspired denition (2) inferred into

the low energy eective action, we will recall the original conjecture of [3], using the
hidden symmetries of low energy supergravity [18]. the hidden symmetries have recently
been reinvestigated in [19, 20], where the symmetry groups ed(+d) were derived from
d = 11 dieomorphisms in internal space, and the change of the symmetry group was

investigated with respect to undualization of elds.

the low-energy eective eld theory of type ii theory on t6 is d = 4 n = 8 maximal
supergravity and has e7(+7) global symmetry [21] acting in the fundamental 56 repre-
sentation. by an embedding into e8(+8), we will recover this representation in an easily
manageable way and give its chevalley generators in this representation. this will

allow to address the discrete group explicitly.

the dirac-schwinger-zwanziger quantization condition in four dimensions [23] dis-

cretizes electric and magnetic charges of the u(1) gauge elds of the theory. the global
e7(+7) symmetry is therefore broken to a discrete e7(+7)(z) symmetry, inducing integer
shifts on the charge lattice. since the most general duality group for our eld congura-
tion is known to be sp(2k, r) [22] and the discrete group e7(+7)(z) was not determined
directly in [3], it was conjectured that the group

e7(+7)(z) = e7(+7)  sp(56, z)

(3)

2

is a symmetry of the full type ii string theory.

we will give a complete set of generators for the discrete e7(+7)(z) group by demand-
ing integer shifts on the lattice. we will use these to identify the known string dualities
in our notation, and show that the denitions (1) and (2) agree with the one we have

found, and comment on the algebraic generators reviewed in [17].

duality groups of the type ii string theory in dimensions larger than four are found
by the intersections of the classical duality group with e7(+7)(z). for d = 3, the situation
is more complicated.

the classical continuous duality symmetry in three dimensions is e8(+8), explicitly
used for construction in [24]. but the meaning of a duality group is unclear since only
scalars remain in the theory and electric charge seems ill dened. a dsz quantization

condition for d = 3 seems unclear, and no analogue to sp(2k, z) and the construction
(3) is known.

we will give an explicit construction of the u-duality group in three dimensions by
extending a conjecture made by hull and townsend [3], parallel to a method applied to
the heterotic string by sen [8, 9]. this will enable us to describe the u-duality group

in three dimensions explicitly and give a set of generators for this group as well. the
procedure is illustrated in gure 1. by compactifying m-theory on the torus, we can

choose eight dierent ways how to compactify rst to four dimensions. this results in
eight e7(+7)(z) acting dierently on m-theory elds. by reducing the theory further to
three dimensions, these groups are merged together to form the three dimensional duality
group.

we will illustrate duality in d = 3 by giving the embedding of m-theory particle

solutions in d = 4, parallel to [8].

before turning to the d = 11 case, we would like to introduce the main concepts rst

in a toy model for simplicity. for this, we will use ve dimensional simple supergravity,
which upon reduction to three dimensions exhibits a g2(+2) global symmetry [25, 26].
it is known that this theory closely resembles d = 11 supergravity, the conjectured low
energy limit of m-theory, in many respects, but no string compactication described by

this no-moduli supergravity at low energies is known [28]. the reduction procedure for
this theory is illustrated in gure 2.

after introducing the main concepts in this simple model, the d = 11 case will be

constructed strictly along the same lines. quite surprisingly, we will see that these models
dier in a major point. we will discuss this dierence again in the last section, where

the direct embedding of the toy model into m-theory will be given.

2 the g2(+2) toy model

we start with d = 5 simple supergravity [26, 27]. we will study this theory as a toy model
for the low energy eective action of type ii string theory and m-theory and introduce

the main technical concepts. we will nd an embedding into m-theory in the last section.

the bosonic part of the lagrangian of simple d = 5 supergravity is given by

123

m n p qrfm n fp qar,

where fm n = 2[m an ]. indices m, n run from 0...4. we take the signature (+).
to get a d = 3 u-duality group, we are interested in compactications of this theory

to three dimensions. the vielbein can be written as

m = " e1e(3)
e(5)a

where the indices i, a run from 1 . . . 2. e a
is called the internal vielbein and is assumed
i
to be of triangular shape. e is its determinant. the vector eld decomposes into am =
(a, a2+i), i = 1 . . . 2, leaving a vector eld and two scalars in three dimensions.

in order to determine the d = 4 u-duality analogue in this theory and to see how it

is embedded into d = 3, we will need to reduce in a stepwise fashion.

for this, we will interpret the coordinates {0, 1, 2, 3} as coordinates of the ve dimen-
sional theory with compact dimension 4, corresponding to the left side of gure 2. we

will study this eectively four dimensional theory and identify the u-duality group on
the classical and quantum level.

we will then reduce the theory further to three dimensions with coordinates {0, 1, 2}
and interpret the three dimensional theory as four dimensional theory with compact
dimension 3. we will show that this reduction leads to a g2(+2)/so(4) nonlinear coset
sigma model. we will identify the four dimensional u-duality in this theory and show
how it acts.

we will then study the other compactication procedure indicated on the right side
of gure 2. now the coordinates {0, 1, 2, 4} will be interpreted as four dimensional coor-
dinates, leading to a dierent u-duality group. we will then show how these two groups
merge together to form the three dimensional u-duality.

2.2 duality in d = 4

following [3], we will dene the analogue of u-duality. the classical theory has a con-
tinuous sl(2, r) duality symmetry that interchanges bianchi identities and equations of

motion. its action is

f  1f, v (4)  v (4),   sl(2, r).

(8)
the transformation of v (4) is accompanied by a compensating local so(2) transformation
v (4)  h(x)v (4), h(x)  so(2) to restore the parameterization of the coset space.

and

z = " p

q # ,

p =

2 i g,

q = i h

p = " p a

pb # ,

q = " q a

qb # ,

the p charges are interpreted as magnetic, the q charges as noether electric charges.

we will introduce a charged elementary soliton multiplet in the d = 11 section and
study it. due to its simplicity, the soliton solution presented there is actually a soliton in
our toy-model as well. in m-theory, these solitons have been identied with fundamental

and solitonic string states and d-brane states that ll the u-duality multiplets [3].

the charge vector z transforms as

z  1z,   sl(2, r)

under the classical duality symmetry.

upon quantization, the charges have to obey the dirac-schwinger-zwanziger charge

quantization condition. if all electric and magnetic charges exist, they are restricted to
live on an integer lattice, and the sl(2, r) symmetry is broken to a discrete subgroup
inducing integer shifts, which is sl(2, z). note that the situation is complicated due to
the fact that the two gauge elds a and b are not treated on the same footing by the
sl(2, r) symmetry, but b carries spin 3/2 and a spin -1/2 with respect to sl(2, r),
that is, they correspond to weights of dierent length.

to see how sl(2, z) acts, we will not try to uncover the intersection of sl(2, r) with

sp(4, z), but follow a more direct path. for this, we change the basis of the sl(2, r)
representation space. we dene

with

f = uf , v (4) = uv (4)u1, etc.

condition yield that {pb, qb} are in 3z.

this symmetry can be interpreted as the analogue of d = 4 u-duality in our toy model.
if the {p a, q a} = {pa, qa} are chosen to be integer, the sl(2, z) symmetry and dsz
note that on the scalar z  1/3a4 + i this denition of sl(2, z) induces the
familiar modular transformations z  z + 1 and z  1/z under t and s, respectively1.
we will now assume as in [8] that this quantum symmetry is not broken when we

further compactify to three dimensions.

to recover d = 4 solitons in the d = 3 theory, one may take an array of solitonic

solutions aligned along a specic direction [8, 3, 11, 17]. compactication of this direction
then corresponds to identify this array periodically and taking the period to be small. we

will see in the m-theory section that this leads to vortex solutions in three dimensions. we
will recover the d = 4 u-duality in the reduced theory acting exactly on these solutions
and their 4d charges. the equivalence of such periodic array solutions and fundamental

string states under duality for the d = 3 heterotic string was studied closely in [8].

2.3 the d = 3 theory

we will now reduce the theory further to three dimension 2. for this, we assume that the
direction 3 is compact and the elds do not depend on this coordinate, which corresponds
1looking at the lagrangian, it is obvious that in the asymptotic limit z is exactly the  parameter

we will maximally dualize [19] all elds such that only scalars remain in the theory.

we will now show that the scalars of this theory t into a g2(+2)/so(4) coset, where
g2(+2) is the normal real form [29] of g2. the lagrangian gets

v (3)v (3)1 = q(3)

 + p (3)

 , q(3)

  g2(+2), p (3)

  g2(+2)  so(4).

for the algebra g2(+2) of g2(+2), we will use freudenthals realization of exceptional
lie algebras explained in appendix a. this will allow us to stay as closely as possible to

the d = 11 case.

for the positive roots, the corresponding generators are ei

j, 1  i  j  3, ei, 1 
i  2 and e3, for the cartan subalgebra we use generators hi, i = 1, 2. their denitions
and commutators are given in the appendix. the generator e1
2 corresponds to the long
simple positive root, the generator e2 to the short one.

we will now use the fact that g2(+2) has a maximal subgroup sl(2)  sl(2), where
in the

the two sl(2) groups are generated by the short simple and the lowest root.

iwasawa decomposition, the sl(2) generated by the short simple root will be associated
with v (4), while the sl(2) generated by the lowest root will carry the 3d dilaton and
dualized kaluza-klein gauge eld.

the representation inuences only the prefactor of the scalar term in the lagrangian which could be chosen
according to which representation is used. but due to the decomposition (14), we have used the adjoint
of g2(+2).

the d = 4 charges, this is exactly the transformation behavior (8) and resembles the four

dimensional u-duality in the reduced model. we will illustrate this in the d = 11 case
by studying an elementary soliton multiplet.

in the reduced model, the discrete group is now generated by

s2 = exp(e2 ) exp(e2) exp(e2 ), t 2 = exp(e2).

this exactly reproduces the result of [26] obtained by direct reduction to d = 3.

2.7 dierent orders of compactication

we will now exploit this connection to d = 5 elds. we chose to reduce in the order of
the left side of gure 2 and arrived at a theory with scalar coset matrix (17) called v (3)
in the following. the d = 4 u-duality is generated by

#1

s2 = exp(e2 ) exp(e2) exp(e2 ), t 2 = exp(e2).

14

we will now turn to the right side of gure 2. we consider rst the d = 5 vielbein.
we need a convenient parameterization for the second reduction. for this, we perform a

local lorentz transformation

which yields tan  = 3/2e/2b3.

using this parameterization, we can perform the reduction strictly parallel to the one
before, only a sign change in the chern-simons term has to be taken into account. the

result is

the d = 4 discrete u-duality is again generated by

2.8 joining d = 4 u-dualities in d = 3

scalar matrices are related by

and resembles the t-duality transformation in gure 2. it represents the needed weyl
reection in the root space of g2(+2).

somewhat unexpected is the appearance of p in (18). p is a parity transformation

given by

p = (1)(h1+h2) = (s1

3)2 = (s2)2

and is an element of d = 4 u-duality corresponding to a charge conjugation of the d = 4

charges.

turning to the u-duality transformations, consider a transformation u on v (3)

have

u is a matrix generated by

s1 = exp(e1 ) exp(e1) exp(e1 ), t 1 = exp(e1).

the joint u-duality group u(z) in three dimensions is therefore generated by

s1, s2, t 1, t 2.

this discrete subgroup of g2(+2) can now be compared with the notion of g2(+2)(z)
as presented in appendix b. we will see there that g2(+2)(z) is expected to be generated
by si

j, t i for all positive roots of g2(+2).

j, si, t i

but quite obviously u(z) is not g2(+2)(z), but the former is strictly smaller than the
latter. all generators of u(z) correspond to short roots of g2(+2). it is only possible to
generate e.g. (t 1
2). that these groups do not agree is therefore
connected to the fact that g2(+2) is not simply laced.

2)3 from them, but not (t 1

d = 5 simple supergravity has no moduli elds, and no string compactication de-
scribed by this supergravity at low energies is known. therefore one cannot determine

which is the correct u-duality group until such a microscopic realization is found.

note that the proof in the appendix and in [46] uses minimal resp. basic representa-

tions, that is, all nontrivial weights of the representation are transformed into each other
by the weyl group and must therefore be of the same length. the adjoint of g2(+2) and

16

the 4 of sl(2, r) do not belong to this class. but, as stated in [46], the notion of the
group g2(+2)(z) is independent of its representation.

the disagreement of u(z) with g2(+2)(z) might be surprising at rst. we will now

turn to the d = 11 case to see if the same is true in this model.

later we use i, j, . . . = 1, 2, . . . , 8 as the indices for the eight dimensional torus in the

will treat the symmetries and subgroups more closely in the following section.

3.2 duality in d = 4

the equations of motion of the theory show the full e7(+7) invariance. the classical
duality symmetry is given by

f  1f, v (4)  v (4),   e7(+7).

21

again, the transformation of v (4) is accompanied by a compensating local su(8) trans-
formation v (4)  h(x)v (4), h(x)  su(8) to restore the parameterization of the coset
space.

we again dene charges

it has been argued in [3] that all magnetic and electric charges exist. it is actually clear
from the basis (25) and the fact that the 56 representation of e7(+7) is minimal that, if
a solution with one nonzero charge exists, solutions with a single charge carried by all
other gauge elds may be obtained by weyl reections that are group elements of e7(+7),
to be introduced below.
the dsz condition

z t  z = n, n  z

breaks e7(+7) to e7(+7)(z), demanding integer shifts on the lattice dened by the basis
(25). this group has been proposed to be a unied duality symmetry of type ii string
theory in [3], called u-duality for short, unifying strong-weak coupling dualities and target

space dualities and putting all 70 moduli of the theory, including the string coupling
constant, on the same footing. we will analyse the subgroups corresponding to t- and

s-duality in our notation after introducing generators for the discrete group.

what are generators of this e7(+7)(z)? it may be checked that the basis s in (25)
forms an admissible lattice (see appendix b) of e7(+7) in the representation 56 dened
by (24),(25),(26). the 56 representation of e7(+7) is furthermore the unique minimal
representation [47]. from the proof in appendix b it follows that the subgroup inducing
integer shifts on the lattice with base s, called e7(+7)(z) in the following, is generated
by fundamental unipotents, that is,

in the representation 56, where the s generators are known to carry a representation of
the weyl group modulo z2 (see e.g. [33]).

this yields a complete set of discrete generators of the e7(+7)(z) u-duality. u-duality
groups in higher dimensions are found by their embeddings. since the notion of the
above generators is representation independent, the e6(+6)(z) etc. u-duality generators
follow directly from truncating the dynkin diagram. furthermore, the corresponding
representations in these truncations are always minimal, and the corresponding discrete
group generator representations can be read o explicitly from the basis (25). actually,
in this sense, all u-dualities follow from the adjoint representation of e8(+8).

the equations (24), (25), (26) together with (27) and the denition of f enable us
to give u-duality transformations explicitly in d = 4, but give a direct contact to the
algebraic notations of [16] as well. we will illustrate this below.

it is instructive to identify t- and s-duality symmetries in the theory along the lines

of [34, 8].

the known superstring theories in ten dimensions have a common low-energy sector

whose spectrum is the same as the ns-ns sector of type ii theories. the corresponding
low-energy elds will be called ns-ns elds.

in d = 4, the fundamental string can carry electric charge with respect to the u(1)
elds in the ns-ns sector [35]. t-duality is identied with the subgroup of e7(+7) that
stabilizes the ns-ns charge lattice.

the ns-ns sector in d = 10 consists of the metric, the dilaton and an antisymmetric

two-form. looking at (19) and considering the direction 10 as eleventh spatial dimension,
the ns-ns elds may be identied with

e(4)

8 ,  a

i , b(4)i

a8, ai8, aij8

where indices with tilde run from 2 . . . 7.

where we assume that the rr elds are set to zero.

with (25) this corresponds to the representation space basis

using (50) one may verify that the subgroup stabilizing this basis is the obvious o(6, 6)
subgroup generated as indicated in gure 5.

24

mentioned in [3]. the u(1) eld strength in the r-r sector transform in the 32 spinor
representation of o(6, 6), which means that t-duality mixes electric and magnetic elds

in the r-r sector.
the action of o(6, 6) on the cartan subalgebra part of (27) can be seen by looking

1

m 

8 on the diagonal. the  m

at the submatrix of (27) corresponding to the basis (31). this yields a matrix with
the  m
m correspond to the radii of the compactication
torus transforming under o(6, 6), while 1/2 is the volume of the 7-torus including the
eleventh direction. the appearance of the factor 1/8 indicates that  8
8 , corresponding
to the radius of the eleventh compact direction, transforms as well under t-duality and

in [17]. this transformation therefore mixes
is not decoupled, as was pointed out e.g.
strong weak coupling duality of the type iib string [6, 7], that corresponds to modular
transformations involving  8
8 , with a transformation of the moduli corresponding to the
compactication torus of type ii string theory.

note that the o(6, 6) in our formulation is not a symmetry of the action, but only of

the equations of motion.

we now turn to the commuting sl(2, r) factor in gure 5, which is a symmetry of
the action (28)4. it was suggested in [3] to interpret this factor like in the heterotic case
[34] as a d = 4 s-duality, not to be confused with the d = 10 s-duality of the type iib

string.

interpreting the above sl(2, r) factor as s-duality, a z2 symmetry exchanging electric
and magnetic sector is expected to be present. the natural candidate is s189. using (50),
it is noteworthy that s189 transforms the magnetic into the electric sector and vice versa,
but takes the kaluza-klein sector into the 3-form eld sector (and vice versa) as well.
in the basis we have chosen, s189 has to be accompanied by an o(6, 6) transformation
in order to transform the magnetic to the electric eld strength of a specic vector eld.

this corresponds to the above preserved metric (32), which is equal to

yi<j

si
j yi<j

sij8.

a suitable choice of basis can prevent us from needing this additional o(6, 6) transfor-
mation.

we will now compare our notion of e7(+7)(z) in (29), (30) with the denition (2) used

in [17].

4this is analogous to sens manifestly sl(2, r) invariant action from the dual n = 1 d = 10

supergravity theory. the connection is obvious when all r-r elds are set to zero.

25

in fact, since e7 is simply laced, the generators in (29) corresponding to simple roots
generate all other generators and therefore the whole e7(+7)(z). on the other hand,
the same is true for the simply laced groups o(6, 6, z) and sl(7, z) as subgroups of
e7(+7)(z). both groups correspond to subdiagrams of the dynkin diagram of e7 and act
in minimal representations. the subgroup o(6, 6) is indicated in gure 5, the subgroup
sl(7) simply corresponds to erasing the root e678 for the e7 dynkin diagram. joining
their generators together, we get the whole set of generators of e7(+7)(z). the two
denitions are therefore equivalent.

in the algebraic approach reviewed in [17], weyl and borel generators were used to

dene the discrete group. these actually correspond to the s and t generators in (30).
for the weyl group, the identication

si

j = sij, sijk = tijk

holds, where hatted indices are the weyl generators of [17]. the si
j correspond to the
exchange of two radii, while the sijk correspond to a simultaneous inversion of three radii.
only the sij8 are elements of the t-duality group o(6, 6), corresponding, as pointed out
above, to a simultanous inversion of two radii and the radius corresponding to the eleventh
dimension connected to type iib s-duality.

the borel generators are identied correspondingly, noting for the t-duality group

that the d = 10 antisymmetric tensor eld corresponds to aij8.

but it should be kept in mind that the weyl group representation carried by s is a

representation only modulo z2 shifts on the chevalley generators.

3.3 elementary solitons

in [3], elementary solitonic bps solutions have been identied that each carry a single
type of charge and therefore ll out an e7(+7) multiplet. this also accounts for the
perturbative electrically charged string states that have their solitonic counterparts in
these multiplets. note that these solitons in the ns-ns sector are exact classical solutions

to type ii string theory [3], not only of the low energy sector, and therefore the whole
multiplet consists of exact solutions.

note that other solutions corresponding to bps solitons that break 1/4 and 1/8

supersymmetry have been identied with multi-particle bound states of the elementary
solitons charged with respect to dierent gauge elds [37]. generically these correspond

to intersecting p-brane congurations in higher dimensions [38]. the most general 1/8

26

bps soliton is known to depend on ve parameters, four charges and one relative phase
([13] and references therein).

as already pointed out, the fact that the 56 representation is minimal guarantees
that each gauge eld can be reached by a weyl reection from one nonzero gauge eld.
we will sketch the well known a = 3 black hole solution [36] with am n p = 0 in (19),
which corresponds to the above solitons charged under one kaluza-klein gauge eld, as
an example. for the ten dimensional origin of this multiplet see e.g. [3] and [17].

it is governed by one harmonic function h, iih = 0, where we have chosen carte-

sian coordinates. the metric is of the form

ds2 = h1/2dt2  h 1/2dx2

i

which directly resembles its origin as pp-wave of m-theory traveling in the compact

direction that corresponds to the kk gauge eld it is charged under. choosing a specic
k  {1...7}, the electric solution reads in our notation

b(4)k

ti = h2ih,

gkk = h,

all other elds zero. the harmonic form is chosen to be

h = 1 +

q
|~r|

for a single bps soliton, q corresponds to the electric charge.

for the corresponding multi black hole solution, the harmonic form reads

h = 1 +xn

qn

|~r  ~rn|

reecting the fact that the bogomolnyi bound is saturated and there are no forces be-

tween the constituents, allowing a superposition despite the nonlinearity of the einstein
equations.

the magnetic dual solution, corresponding to the wrapped m-theory kk6-brane, is

given by

with the harmonic form

b(4)k

ij = ijkkh,

gkk = h1,

h = 1 +

p
|~r|

27

for the single soliton with magnetic charge p, and

h = 1 +xn

pn

|~r  ~rn|

for the multi magnetically charged black hole.

solutions charged with respect to the other gauge elds of the theory may now be
obtained by the action of e7(+7) resp. e7(+7)(z). they correspond to wrapped membrane
and vebrane solutions of m-theory. while the s generators take single charge solutions

to single charge solutions, the t generators will yield solitons with multiple charge.

note that the solitons may carry electric or magnetic charges, but there are no dyonic

states in this multiplet. looking at (25), one sees that no corresponding t generators
exist. this is not surprising, since the dyonic solutions are known to have a dierent

conformal structure, while u-duality does not act on the space-time metric.

we will now turn to the compactication to three dimensions. we will assume as in

[8] that the e7(+7)(z) symmetry is not broken.

3.4 the d = 3 theory

the reduction to d = 3 is strictly parallel to the toy model. we will give the reduction
here explicitly by using the embedding of e7(+7) in e8(+8) discussed above5.

dropping the dependence on the compact coordinate, we write the vierbein as

3.5 elementary solitons in d = 3

we will now study how the d = 4 solitons appear in the compactied theory. for this,

we study multi-bps solitons where copies of a single bps soliton of the four dimensional
theory are put along the 3-direction with distance 2r among two of them6.

this corresponds to the harmonic form

h = 1 +xn

z

1 + x2

2 + (x3 + 2rn)2

qx2

where z = q, p for the electric resp. magnetic case.

the above sum is logarithmically divergent, but the divergence can be regularized by

adjusting an additive constant. we can e.g. add a regulator of the form7

z

2rn

.



let us study the derivatives of h with respect to the cartesian coordinates. it has been
shown in [8] that the dependence of h on x3 falls o exponentially if the compactica-
tion radius is small. to study the derivatives with respect to x1, x2, the summation is
approximated by an integration [11], which nally yields

h

where we introduced polar coordinates  = qx2

solution of the d = 3 reduced eld equations. the d = 3 elds read

2 and 8. this extends to an exact

ds2 = h1dt2  dx2
i ,

e = h1/2,

6note that such solutions exist for the schwarzschild case as well [41].

in the magnetic case. this corresponds to the vortex solutions studied in [8]. note

that this solution is not asymptotically at, therefore an interpretation as soliton seems
dicult [17].

under    + 2, we encounter the discrete d = 4 charges by the shifts k9 
k9 + q/2r and k9  k9 + p/2r. full rotations therefore translate to discrete e7(+7)
transformations parallel to [8].

note that the electric and magnetic solutions are embedded in a perfectly equal way.

we actually expect the spectrum to signicantly unify in d = 3, since only particle and
string-like congurations survive.

this concludes our example of d = 4 solitons in d = 3. the whole spectrum in d = 3
will be spanned by e8(+8) resp. a discrete subgroup e8(+8)(z), which we will study now.

3.6 the e8(+8) coset in d = 3

we will recover the e8(+8)/so(16) coset in this section. the decomposition of e8(+8) 
sl(2, r)  e7(+7) in gure 4 was already described in section 3.1. again, the sl(2, r)
factor will carry the d = 3 dilaton and dualized kaluza-klein gauge eld.

using (50) in appendix a, one may verify that the lagrangian (33) takes the form

l =

v(4) is identical to (27), but is now in the 248 adjoint representation of e8(+8).

30

the lagrangain admits local so(16) and global e8(+8) symmetry. quite similar to

the toy model, e8(+8) decomposes as

e8(+8)  sl(2, r)  e7(+7)

248  (2, 56) + (1, 133) + (3, 1).

(35)

v(4) therefore has block structure

3.7

identifying d = 4 u-duality in the d = 3 theory

to recover d = 4 duality, consider an element

where e7(+7) is generated by the set (23). parallel to (15) one gets

  e7(+7),  = ex, x  e7(+7)

v(4)  v(4)1 and y  56()y

and therefore recovers the d = 4 u-duality.

as we have seen, the discrete d = 4 duality in d = 3 corresponds to traveling around
vortex solutions on a full circle. the generators of the discrete group are identical to (29)
resp. (30) in the 248 adjoint representation of e8(+8).

3.8 connection to d = 11 elds

in order to compare dierent orders of compactication as indicated in gure 1, we put
the coset matrix v (3) in a convenient form. remembering the d = 11 vielbein,

3.9 dierent orders of compactication

to study dierent orders of compactication, consider the internal vielbein e a
i . identi-
fying the coordinate 2 + n as fourth coordinate in four dimensions as indicated in gure
1 corresponds to an exchange of the rst and nth row of e a
i . ordering the columns as

32

{n, 2, 3, . . . , n  1, 1, n + 1, . . . , 8}, where the 1 appears at the nth position, we need the
new vielbein e a
to be triangular. for this, one may always nd an so(8) transformation
i
such that the elfbein transforms like

taking the sign change in the chern-simons term into account, we may then write the
scalar coset matrix for the compactication obtained by taking {0, 1, 2, (2 + n)} as four
dimensional coordinates as

v (3)
#n = v (3)

#1(e a

i , i, a(i+2),(j+2),(k+2), ij)

with

and

a(i+2),(j+2),(k+2) = a(i+2),(j+2),(k+2),
a3,(j+2),(k+2) = a(n+2),(j+2),(k+2),

a(n+2),(j+2),(k+2) = a3,(j+2),(k+2),

i, j, k 6= 1, n,
j, k 6= 1, n,

j, k 6= 1, n,

a3,(n+2),(k+2) = a(n+2),3,(k+2), k 6= 1, n

33

nally

ij = ij,
1j = nj,
nj = 1j,
1n = n1,

j 6= 1, n,
j 6= 1, n,

i 6= 1, n,

while the u-duality group in this compactication is generated by (23) and the discrete
group by (29) resp. (30) for all v (3)

3.10 joining u-dualities in d = 3

the above compactications are related by

where hn is the natural lift to e8(+8) of the local transformation (37), s1

leaves the elds anj

to the ns-ns elds in section 3.2.

, b(4)j

the d = 3 u-duality is therefore given by joining all

34

where  is an element of e7(+7) spanned by (23), and in the discrete case by (29) resp.
(30).

note that the intersection of two dierent u-dualities is exactly e6(+6) as expected!
joining all n gives the whole of e8(+8), and the d = 3 discrete u-duality is generated by
the set of generators obtained by exponentiating the chevalley generators for all roots.
this coincides with e8(+8)(z) as dened in appendix b.

we have therefore given a complete set of generators for the u-duality group in three

dimensions.

3.11 g2(+2) in e8(+8)

before concluding, we would like to turn back to our toy model.

g2(+2) may be found in the algebra of e8(+8) by considering the direct embedding

sl(9)  sl(3). we may choose for example

ei12 + ei34 + ei56, ei12 + ei34 + ei56, ej

i (i, j = 7, 8, 9).

it may be checked by using (50) that this choice generates g2(+2). from the point
of view of the physical theory, this truncation is suggested by identifying ({0,1,2,3,4} as
d = 5 coordinates)

ds(11) 2 = ds(5) 2 + ds(e6) 2

a(11) =  1

3a(5)  j, j = 1

2(dx5  dx6 + dx7  dx8 + dx9  dx10)

(38)

where e6 is the at six dimensional euclidean space and j is its kahler form, as suggested
in [38], and a(11), a(5) is the eleven dimensional three form and the ve dimensional one-
form potential.

note that reexpressing the d = 5 one form by its m-theory pendant exactly cancels
the factor 1
3 in (9). the factor 3 is actually symptomatic for the truncation e8(+8) to
g2(+2), e.g the length squared of the long roots is 3 times larger than the one of the short
roots.

in the toy model, we found no agreement of the discrete u-duality group with the

denition of appendix b, while there was agreement for m-theory. however, this may be
seen as a consequence of the rather complicated embedding of g2(+2) into e8(+8), involving
generator sums at the level of the algebra, and leading to a non-simply laced algebra.

35

4 conclusions and outlook

in this paper, we have studied the discrete u-duality groups in the context of low energy
supergravity as proposed by hull and townsend [3]. we have proposed a set of generators
for e7(+7), corresponding to the d = 4 u-duality group, and presented a proof. higher
dimensional u-dualities are found by direct embedding.

in studying this group, we have made the 56 representation of e7(+7) explicit by
an embedding into e8(+8). the way the representation was given might make it man-
ageable in order to investigate u-duality transformations connecting bps solutions as
mentioned in [13].

in comparison to the other denitions of the u-duality group, we have seen that they

agree with our denition and that the set of generators used in the algebraic approach
to u-duality can be identied with ours.

we have extended a proposal by hull and townsend along the lines of sen to determine
the d = 3 u-duality group and found that this indeed yields the full e8(+8)(z) in the
denition of appendix b and [46]. it is interesting to note that the transition from one
compactication to the other involves a parity transformation, corresponding to charge
conjugation in d = 4. the fact that we obtained a proposed d = 3 quantized symmetry

from a d = 4 quantization condition is interesting in this context and might yield new
insights into the quantization in d = 3.

we have studied this procedure also in a truncated model corresponding to simple
d = 5 supergravity, and seen that the d = 3 u-duality group in this case fails to agree

with the denition of appendix b and [46], that is, the u-duality in d = 3 is strictly
smaller. we conclude that truncations of m-theory need to be studied very carefully,

especially in a quantized context.

the procedure we have presented to determine low dimensional discrete u-duality
groups can be extended to d = 2 and even d = 1. in these theories, a classical kac-
moody symmetry algebra known as e9 and yangian algebra y (e8) upon quantization
(see [48] for a recent account) is present. by a lightlike reduction, which makes an

intriguing connection to the innite momentum frame of matrix theory, a hyperbolic
kac-moody algebra denoted by e10 is expected ([32], see [49] for an introduction to
hyperbolic kac-moody algebras). in this context, it is interesting to note that the notion
of discrete groups over z has been connected to homeomorphisms of the group ring over

z to z [44, 45, 46], thereby making a connection to hopf algebra structures. it should be
interesting to see how the notion of discrete duality groups extends in this case. work in

36

this direction is in progress.

a exceptional lie algebras

in this appendix, we will present the representation of exceptional lie algebras parallel
to freudenthals paper [30]. we will start with g2(+2), and then turn to e8(+8).

a.1 realization of g2

the lie algebra g2 is known to allow a z3 grading and decomposes into the adjoint and
two fundamental representations of sl(3):

14 = 8  3  3.

(39)

thus any element of g2 can be specied by a traceless matrix x j 
, 1  i, j  3 and
two vectors vi and vi, 1  i  3 which transform as 3 and 3 under sl(3). the lie
bracket of the two elements [x(1), v(1), v(1)], [x(2), v(2), v(2)] gives rise to a new element of
g2 specied by [x(3), v(3), v(3)] with

a.2 realization of e8

the adjoint representation of e8 is decomposed into a sum of irreducible representations
of the subalgebra sl(9) as

248 = 80  84  84,

(44)

where 80 is the dening representation, while 84 (84) is (3,0) ((0,3)) antisymmetric
tensor representation. one may specify any element of e8 by a triple:

[x j 
i

, vij k, vij k

]

(x is traceless; v,v are totally antisymmetric),

(45)

where i, j, . . . = 1, . . . , 9 are the indices of the nine dimensional vector space on which
x, v and v act. the lie bracket of the two elements [x(1), v(1), v(1)] and [x(2), v(2), v(2)]
is again a triple [x(3), v(3), v(3)] with [30] (again, the repeated indices are summed over.)

b discrete subgroups of lie groups

in this appendix we study the properties of the discrete subgroup g(z) used in this paper.
we give a denition of g(z) and propose a set of generators. we use properties of a special

41

class of representations relevant to dualities, together with the birkho decomposition of
lie groups [43] to prove that all elements of g(z) can be generated from this set.

let g be a complex simple lie group, and g be the lie algebra of g. let h be a
cartan subalgebra of g, and h be its lie group. let  be the set of roots of g relative
to h,  a xed set of simple roots in  and +() the set of positive(negative) roots
with respect to .

consider a nontrivial irreducible representation  of g and let  be the set of weights
of . let us call  a minimal representation if all    are transformed into each other
it is easy to show that  is a minimal representation if
by the weyl group w of g.
and only if h, i(= 2(, )/(, )) = 0 or 1 for all   ,   . each coset
of the root lattice r in the weight lattice  contains precisely one highest weight of a
minimal representation. thus there are |/r|  1 such representations. in fact they are
all fundamental representations. (see [47], page 72.) it is enough to consider only this

particular class of representations, since they include all the representations relevant to
our discussion such as the 56 of e7, the n of sl(n) and the 2 n of so(2n) 11.

let v be a representation space of a minimal representation . a lattice vz in v is
dened to be the z-span of a basis of v . with a xed chevalley basis {e,   ; hi, 1 
i  n} of g, a lattice vz is said to be admissible if vz is invariant under the action of the
z-form u(g)z [47] of the universal enveloping algebra u(g), that is, invariant under the
actions of all (e)n/n!, n  n. the discrete group g(z) of g is dened as the subgroup
of g which consists of all g  g such that (g) stabilizes vz [45].
remark. an admissible lattice xes in which basis of v the entries of the elements of
g(z) are restricted to integer values. for example,

sl(2, z) = (" a b

c d # | a, b, c, d  z, ad  bc = 1)

stabilizes the admissible lattice

z" 1

0 #  z" 0

1 # .

in other generic basis of v , sl(2, z) is not represented as a group of matrices with integral
entries. in d = 4 duality in general, each u(1) gauge eld corresponds to dierent weight

space and one can always normalize the charge lattice so that it may coincide with an
admissible lattice. therefore this denition of g(z) and the concept of discrete duality

groups agree.

11in ref.[46] a larger class of representations which may include zero weights are considered and called

basic representations. it is also claimed that g(z) does not depend on the representation.

42

one can construct the smallest admissible lattice vz by acting u(g)z to a given

highest weight vector of v .

we will now prove the following proposition:

proposition [46]. g(z) coincides with the group generated by

{exp e|  }

denoted by e(z) in the following.

example. as is well known, sl(2, z) is generated by

exp e = " 1 1
0 1 #

and

exp e

1 1 # ,

 = " 1 0
) exp e.

or equivalently t = exp e and s = exp e exp(e
proof of proposition. let 1 be the simple root dual to the highest weight 1 of . let
+ be the set of positive roots orthogonal to 1: + = {  +|(1, ) = 0}. we
introduce and x an order (denoted by <) among the elements of + in such a way that
 <  if   + and   +  +. similarly, for ,  , we dene  <  if
 < .

we can take a basis {v|  } of vz as

v1,
v1 = (e
v1 = (e

)v1
)(e

(  +  +),
)v1

(,   +  +),

  
where the product of (e
)s are normal-ordered according to the order introduced
above, that is, (e

) comes to the left of (e

) if  < .

it is known that any g  g can be written in the form (the birkho decomposition)
(55)

exp(c

exp(ce)

g = y+

e

)  w(g)  y+

with w(g) being an element of the normalizer of h. the multiple products are normal-
ordered similarly. since  is a minimal representation, (e)2 = 0 for any root . thus
each factor (exp ce) in (g) (55) can be replaced by 1 + c(e).

let us write

(g)v1 = x

(g)1v,

(g)1  z.

(56)

43

let s = exp(e) exp e
 exp(e)  ez,   . then (s) sends v to a vector
proportional to v(), where  is the weyl reection with respect to . since any
weight of  is transformed to the highest weight by the weyl group, one can nd some
s  ez (written as a product of ss) such that (s)v  v1 for any weight . therefore,
if (g)11 = 0, one may still have (sg)11 6= 0 for some element s of ez. thus we
assume that (g)11 6= 0 from the beginning, without loss of generality.

since (e)v1 = 0 for any positive root , and since (e)1 6= 0 only if  = 1 for
any negative root  and any weight , our assumption (g)11 6= 0 implies that w(g)
in (56) stabilizes the highest weight 1, i.e. (w(g))v1 = cv1 for some constant c  c.
thus in the rst column and row of the matrix (g) we have

(1 + c

)
e
1
(1 + ce)
 z.

 z,

(g)1 = c  
(g)1 = c  

 y++
 y++
in particular, if 1   =   +  +, we have
  z,
(g)1 = cc
(g)1 = cc  z,
(g)11 = c  z.

(57)

(58)

note, again, that the factors in the multiple products are ordered according to some xed

ordering of the roots. if  is a weight but cannot be reached from the highest weight
1 by a single weyl reection, then (g)1 ((g)1) is expressed as a polynomial of c
(c).



we have dened ez to be the group generated by {exp e|  }. we will now show
that if g  g(z), then g can be reduced, by multiplying some elements in ez to g, to
an element of a subgroup g(z) constructed from g  g with rankg < rankg. once
if this is proved, then repeating these operations, one may reduce any g to the identity.

by induction this will show that g(z) = ez.

let us rst consider the case when g is simply laced. in this case we x a lexicographic
order in + dened by the inner product in the weight space with some ordered basis i,
i = 1, . . . , rankg. (the reason for why we need this will be explained soon.) for example,
one may rst dene a partial order in + by the height, that is, the inner product 1 = ,
half the sum of positive roots. for ,   + with the same height, one may next take

44

some arbitrary  (linearly independent of ) and dene  <  if (, ) < (, ). for
those which have the same inner product with , one may consider the product with
another independent . in this way one may have a lexicographic order in +12.

suppose rst that (g)1 6= 0,  = 1   for the minimal   +  + with respect
to the above lexicographic order (that is,  <  for any  6=  in +  +). let us put
t = exp e  ez, and s = t1
 t
(tn

  ez as before. then for n  z we have

t1

sg)1 = n(g)11  (g)1,
sg)11 = (g)1.

(tn

(59)

there exists some integer n such that (tn
this operation, one can reduce the (, 1) entry of (g) to 0 (euclidean algorithm).

sg)1 < (g)1. therefore, by repeating

we next assume that there exists some   +  + such that (g)1 = 0 for all
 = 1  ,  < , and (g)1,1 6= 0. then applying a similar operation to 1  , we
have (u

of ez.

g)1,1 = 0 for some element u





thus, by induction, we have (u

g)1,1 = 0 for all   +  + for some element



u

  ez.
let   +  +, that is, a positive root that contains 1. then (e

) does not kill
)v1 6= 0. for any minimal representation of a simply laced simple lie group
v1: (e
g, such  can contain only one 1. therefore, any root in +  + cannot be a sum of
any other two such roots. then the order in +  + (induced by that in +) ensures
that the inductive assumption (g)1 = 0 for all  = 1 ,  <  can never be violated
by the operation for 1  .

we may now write u

g in the birkho decomposition as



u



g = y+

exp(c

e

)  w(g)  y+

exp(ce).

(60)

therefore, for any weight  6= 1, we have (u
u  ez. actually we may take (u
(u





g)11 = +1 since s2

g)1 = 0 and (u

g)11 = 1 for some



 = 1. using (58), we nd

(61)



g)1 = 0,
g)1 = c  z,

g)11 = 1,

(u

(u



12this lexicographic order can be dierent from the order introduced above equation (55), but they

can be made consistent if 1 is taken = 1. thus we use the same symbol < here for simplicity.

45

where   +  +. thus u+ = q++ exp(ce) (in an arbitrary order) belongs

to ez, and

(u



gu+)1 = 0,

(u

gu+)1 = 0,


gu+)11 = 1

(u



(62)

for all the weights  6= 1. therefore, u
gu+ belongs to the subgroup g  g of whose
simple roots are  1, and the minimal representation  of g is again decomposed into
a direct sum of minimal representations of g. this is what we desired, and completes
the proof for a simply laced lie group g.



finally, if g is not simply laced, the minimal representation  is either the 2n for
so(2n + 1) or the 2n for sp(2n). one may also apply the same argument to these

cases except for the modication in the consistent order of operations; since some roots
in + + can be written as a sum of two roots in + + if g is not simply laced, the
lexicographic order fails to ensure the consistency of induction. nevertheless, one may
still nd alternative consistent orders of operations explicitly, and prove the proposition
in both cases. we omit the detail in this paper; a way to nd this is to write the hasse

diagrams for these representations.
