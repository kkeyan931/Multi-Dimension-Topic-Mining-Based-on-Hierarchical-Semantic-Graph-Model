1 introduction

string theories develop instabilities at high temperature t . the t -dependent mass
of some winding states becomes tachyonic at the hagedorn temperature. this phe-
nomenon has been described [1, 2, 3] in perturbative string theories by identifying the
(modular invariant) modication at nite temperature of the string partition function.
the mechanism is similar to a s 1 compactication of (euclidean) time with radius
r = (2t )1, supplemented by a spin-dependent periodicity phase related, because of
modular invariance, to a modication of the gso projections. supersymmetry spon-
taneously breaks by a stringy scherk-schwarz mechanism.

in ve dimensions, heterotic strings on t 4  s 1, iia and iib strings on k3  s 1
are related by s- and t -dualities. an extension of the perturbative description of
strings at nite temperature with a universal (duality-invariant) temperature modulus
should then display an interesting non-perturbative structure of thermal phases. this
contribution reviews some aspects of this analysis, as performed in ref.
[4] (where a
more complete list of references can be found). other aspects are described in the
contribution of costas kounnas [5] to these proceedings.

the starting point of the construction is the bps mass formula for n4 = 4 four-
dimensional strings, and its temperature deformation. in terms of the (heterotic) string
coupling gh and the t 2 torus radii r and r6, the supersymmetric mass formula is [6]:

the integers m, n, m, n are the four electric momentum and winding numbers for
the four u(1) charges from t 2 compactication. the numbers m, n, m, n are their
magnetic non-perturbative partners, from the heterotic point of view.
in the nite
temperature case, the radius r is identied with the inverse temperature, r = (2t )1.
the mass formula reads then:

t =   m + q + kp

where we have set m = n = m = n = 0 to retain only the lightest states and q is
the (space-time) helicity charge. the integer k is the common divisor of (n, m, n) 
k(p, q, r) and tp,q,r is an eective string tension

r6 direction, which is orthogonal to the ve-brane. all winding numbers n, m, n

correspond to magnetic charges from the eld theory point of view. their masses are
proportional to the temperature radius r and are not thermally shifted.

where 

h = 22s, 

iia = 22t and 

iib = 22u when expressed in planck units.

the mass formula (2) possesses the same duality properties as the zero-temperature
expression (1). in addition, r, the inverse temperature, is a duality-invariant quantity.
eq. (2) gives the states and critical values of the temperature radius at which a tachyon
appears. each corresponds to the hagedorn transition of a perturbative string, either
heterotic, or iia or iib. it also contains new information (on critical values of h
and/or r6) since it also decides which tachyon arises rst when t  1/r increases.

2 four-dimensional eective supergravity

five-dimensional strings at nite temperature can eectively be described by a four-
dimensional supergravity, in which supersymmetry is spontaneously broken by thermal
eects. since we want to limit ourselves to the description of instabilities, it is sucient
to only retain, in the full n4 = 4 spectrum, the potentially massless and tachyonic
states, as given by mass formula (2). we can then consider only spin 0 and 1/2 states
in chiral multiplets coupled to n4 = 1 supergravity1.

the scalar manifold of a generic, unbroken, n4 = 4 theory is [7][10]

  sl(2, r)

u(1) !s  g/h,

g/h =  

so(6, r + n)

so(6)  so(r + n)!ti ,a

.

(4)

the manifold g/h of the vector multiplets splits into a part that includes the 6r
moduli ti, and a second part with the innite number n   of bps states a.
in the manifold g/h, we are only interested in keeping the six bps states z 
a ,
a = 1, 2, 3, which generate thermal instabilities in heterotic, iia and iib strings. for
consistency2, these states must be supplemented by two moduli t and u among the
tis. we consider heterotic and type ii strings respectively on t 4  s 1
5 and
k3  s 1
5 is the temperature circle. the moduli
t and u describe the t 2  s 1
6 torus. thus, r + n = 8 in the n4 = 4 manifold
(4). to construct the appropriate truncation of the scalar manifold g/h, we use a
z2  z2 subgroup contained in the so(6) r-symmetry of the coset g/h for projecting
out non-invariant states of the n4 = 4 theory with r + n = 8.
a single z2 would split h = so(6) so(8) in [so(2) so(2)] [so(4) so(6)],

6 is a trivial circle and s 1

1the four gravitinos remain degenerate at nite temperature.
2see formula (2) which depends on three moduli s = re s, t = re t and u = re u .

2

at this stage, the theory would have n4 = 2 supersymmetry and the rst three factors
in the scalar manifold are vector multiplet couplings with prepotential f = ist u/x0.
the last one is a quaternionic coupling of hypermultiplets. the second z2 projection
acts on this factor and reduces it to

 

so(2, 3)

so(2)  so(3)!z +

a

 

so(2, 3)

so(2)  so(3)!z 

a

,

a = 1, 2, 3.

(6)

this is a kahler manifold for chiral multiplets coupled to n4 = 1 supergravity. the
second z2 projection also truncates n4 = 2 vector multiplets into n4 = 1 chiral multi-
plets.

the structure of the truncated scalar manifold and the poincare n4 = 4 constraints

on the scalar elds [9] indicate that the kahler potential can be written as [2, 11]
k =  log(s +s)log(t +t )log(u +u )log y (z +
with

y (z

a ) = 1  2z

(8)

this kahler function can be determined for instance by comparing the gravitino mass
terms in the n4 = 1 lagrangian and inthe z2  z2 truncation of n4 = 4 supergravity.
the n4 = 1 eective supergravity is dened by k and a holomorphic superpotential
w . and n4 = 4 supergravity is dened once a eld representation of the scalar
manifold has been found, by specifying a gauging [9] which in particular generates
the scalar potential and gravitino mass terms. finding the correct gauging for nite
temperature n4 = 4 strings involves some guesswork [2, 11] and its translation into the
superpotential is again easily obtained by comparing gravitino mass terms. for mass
formula (2), we nd:

w = 22(cid:20)1

(9)
notice that the same eective lagrangian could have been derived at the n4 = 2 level,
using a single z2 truncation of the theory.

eqs. (79) dene a supergravity theory which includes in its solutions the thermal
phases of ve-dimensional n4 = 4 heterotic, type iia and type iib strings. it possesses
all duality properties expected from these theories. we now turn to a survey of the
most interesting phases.

3 masses in the low-temperature phase

the n = 1 supergravity scalar potential generated by the kahler function (7) and the
superpotential (9) can be written

v = 4ek ,

 = s + t + u + + + .

(10)

each contribution s, t , . . ., to the potential is a polynomial in the elds s, t , u
and z 
a and their
a .

in addition, v only depends on quadratic combinations of z

conjugates.
respect to these elds. since v (s, t, u, z 
a = 0)  0, it is also stationary for all values
of s, t and u. this vacuum will be stable as long as the masses (squared) of the elds
z 
a remain positive. this will be the case for low temperature, weak string couplings
and intermediate values of the compactication radius r6.

a and stationary at z 

the low-temperature phase is common to the three strings, it is to some extent a

self-dual phase. this is also visible in the pattern of supersymmetry breaking. since

(other derivatives of g = k + log |w|2 vanish), the canonically normalized goldstino
is the sum of the fermionic partners of s, t and u. and the gravitino mass is

iib duality. the discussion of the mass spectrum is then similar for string states with
momentum number m and iib winding n. again, thermal instabilities are generated

this phase exists in the perturbative regime of all three strings. the relevant light

in the type iia picture.

at the level of the potential only, this phase exhibits a runaway behaviour in s. the
eective supergravity is solved by a background with a dilaton linear in a space-like
direction4. its content in terms of non-critical strings is described in detail in ref. [4]
5. we will here only consider its mass pattern and the breakdown of supersymmetry.
the high-temperature heterotic phase only exists in the perturbative domain of
the heterotic string, where s is the dilaton, and, by duality, in non-perturbative type
ii regimes. accordingly, supersymmetry breaking arises from s: only gs is non-zero.
the mass spectrum naturally splits in two sectors, the heterotic dilaton multiplet and
secondly all other chiral multiplets (ya, a) that play a passive role in supersymmetry
breaking.

since the kahler metric is diagonal, gb = 0 and gs

(20)

mixings can only arise from non-zero values of gab due to superpotential contributions.
since w includes a term proportional to t uz +
1 , these four elds, which are non-
zero at the vacuum, get mixed. masses are completely determined (in m3/2 units) since
all parameters are xed in this sector. on the other hand, fermion masses in the z 
sector are m3/2[su  1] and m3/2[st  1] in the z 

3 sector.

comparing with the fermion mass matrix (20), one observes that the spectrum would
be supersymmetric6 without the o-diagonal term proportional to 2sw 1w sij. since
supersymmetry breaks in the s direction, these contributions generate oraifeartaigh-
type bosonic mass shifts for states that couple in the superpotential to s: these are the
heterotic dyonic states z 
3 , which generate type ii instabilities. heterotic per-
turbative states have a supersymmmetric spectrum [2]. the supersymmetry-breaking
contributions to the scalar mass spectrum imply the existence of non-perturbative

however, that this statement may not hold in the case of the four-dimensional back-
ground solution with a dilaton motion in one direction. this case has only an eective
three-dimensional poincare invariance, which does not imply in general mass degener-
acyin massive multiplets, even if local supersymmetry is unbroken [12, 13].
