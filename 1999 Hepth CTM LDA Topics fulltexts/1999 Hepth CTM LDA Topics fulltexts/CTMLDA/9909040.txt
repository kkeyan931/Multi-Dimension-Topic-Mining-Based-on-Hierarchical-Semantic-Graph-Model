(this title says large n theories.) 2. wilson loops n = 4 super yang-mills theory let start n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory four dimensions. mentioned, part talk purely eld theoretical. 2.1. denition wilson loop phase factor associated trajectory quark fundamental representation gauge group g. discuss case g = u(n). n = 4 theory consists gauge eld a, four weyl fermions (a = 1, , 4), six scalar elds (i = 1, , 6) adjoint representation gauge group u(n). theory contain particles fundamental representation. instead, may use w-boson probe theory. start u(n + 1) gauge group break u(n) u(1) choosing non-zero vacuum expectation values scalar elds. u (n +1) = u (n ) = 0 0 0 ui! . (1) since six scalar elds, parametrize vacuum expectation values point unit 5-sphere, 2 = 1, corresponding direction symmetry breaking. absolute value scalar vacuum expectation value denoted u. phase factor associated trajectory w-boson gives loop operator form, w = tr p exp(cid:20)i ds(cid:16)ia(x(s)) x(s) + ii(x(s))i(s)| x(s)|(cid:17)(cid:21) , minkowski space, w = tr p exp(cid:20)i ds(cid:16)ia(x(s)) x(s) + i(x(s))i(s)| x(s)|(cid:17)(cid:21) , (2) (3) euclid space. point important dierence minkowski case euclidean case, absence imaginary unit front scalar eld euclidean case. particular, wilson loop euclidean case pure phase. distinction important many results following. talk, deal euclidean case only. 3 another important aspect wilson loop (3) generated w-boson couples gauge eld scalar eld strength since 2 = 1. clearly consequence fact w-boson case bps particle. general gauge invariant observable one write down. general, one may consider general loop operator whose coupling strength gauge eld may dierent scalar eld, w = tr p exp(cid:20)i ds(cid:16)ia(x(s)) x(s) + i(x(s)) yi(s)(cid:17)(cid:21) . (4) used symbol yi denote coupling scalar eld. phase factor w-boson trajectory corresponds special case x2 = y2. 2.2. uv divergence although n = 4 theory ultra-violet nite, composite operators theory may require regularization. two local operators coincide point, example, divergence. let us discuss ultraviolet divergence wilson loop operator. turns operator constraint x2 = y2 special regard. hooft coupling g2n small, one may compute vacuum expectation value wilson loop (4) perturbative expansion. one-loop computation gives hwi = 1 + g2n (2)2 ds| x| 1 y2 x2! + . (5) uv cuto parameter. x2 = y2, divergence canceled due cancellation gauge eld exchange scalar eld exchange diagrams. seems cancellation persists higher loops. see following, ads/cft correspondence shows cancellation uv divergence happens large g2n also. far, assumed loop smooth. singularity loop, divergence completely canceled, logarithmic divergence remains even x2 = y2. example, loop cusp, one-loop computation shows logarithmic divergence depending angle cusp hwwith cuspi = 1 + g2n (2)2 sin (cos + cos ) log(cid:18)1 (cid:19) + , (6) angle cusp (i.e. jump x/| x|). cusp, direction = yi/| y| yi may also change discontinuously; angle amount discontinuity cups. renormalizing divergence would give anomalous scaling property loop, depends . also 4 logarithmic divergence loop intersection. hwwith intersectioni = 1 + g2n 2 1 sin (cos + cos ) log(cid:18)1 (cid:19) + . (7) somewhat similar logarithmic divergence even-dimensional observables (such points surfaces) discussed berenstein, corrado, fischler maldacena {$9809188$} graham witten {$9901021$}. 2.3. loop equation large-n loop equation considered one fundamental properties wilson loop operators . expected hold small large g2n. g2n small, equivalent perturbative feynmann rules gauge theory. hand, subtleties denition loop equation since derived assuming loops regularized renormalized. fact, equation depends explicitly uv cuto. situation seems better n = 4 theory better ultraviolet behavior saw above. since equation supposed hold large g2n also, may useful testing stringy aspects ads/cft correspondence. comment later talk. order write loop equation, need complete set gauge invariant observables written form loops. particular, need introduce sources fermion elds also. point view supersymmetry, natural couple fermionic variable gluino eld combination, w = trp exp(cid:20)i ds(cid:18)ia x + yi + 2 (i x + yi) + (cid:19)(cid:21) .

(12) 6 3.1. boundary conditions compute wilson loop observables framework, important understand relation loop variables boundary condition string worldsheet. well-known conformal eld theory string worldsheet couples spacetime gauge elds d1 x 1 + ip i! , (13) integral along boundary worldsheet. use ( = 1, 2) worldsheet coordinates worldsheet boundary 2 = 0. vector eld couples derivative string coordinates x along boundary worldsheet. scalar elds i, hand, couple momentum p conjugate corresponding string coordinates i, p = 1 g g1 , (14) g metric worldsheet. scalar elds correspond transverse coordinates d-brane, t-dual gauge eld along d-brane. since momentum p t-dual derivative string coordinate along boundary, scalar elds couple p i. since gauge eld couples derivative string coordinates 1x along boundary scalar eld couples momentum p conjugate string coordinates boundary, clear wilson loop operator form (4) couples string worldsheet following boundary conditions. x (1, 2 = 0) = x(1) dyi d1 (1) p i(1, 2 = 0) = (15) four-dimensional directions along d3-brane, string worldsheet obeys dirichlet condition string ends along loop x(s). six transverse directions, string momentum xed following neumann condition. boundary conditions complementary standard d3-brane boundary conditions (neumann condition x dirichlet condition i), since imposing extra conditions inserting loop operator d-brane. g2n large, string tension becomes large approximate string dynamics minimum surface ads {$9711200$}. given set loop variables (x(s), yi(s)), expect unique minimum surface ads obeying boundary conditions. existence uniqueness minimum surfaces ads, case yi constant, discussed mathematics literature (see, example, ads/cft ). this, however, leads puzzle. 7 correspondence, expect boundary conditions bulk degrees freedom imposed boundary ads = 0. however condition string worldsheet terminate = 0 would extra dirichlet boundary condition. may may compatible ten dirichlet/neumann boundary conditions already imposed. turns nice resolution puzzle. one show that, boundary conditions smooth, minimum surface obeying ten boundary conditions terminate = 0 constraint x2 = y2 satised {$9904191$}. shown using hamilton-jacobi equation minimum surface ads. ts nicely fact saw earlier eld theory point view; wilson loop generated trajectory w-boson obeys constraint x2 = y2. resolves puzzle, raises another question dene wilson loop operator obey constraint. come back question later. 3.2. legendre transformation nd minimum surface obeying boundary condition, compute value classical action. semi-classical approximation, vacuum expectation value wilson loop given exponential action minimum surface. question action use. naive guess would area surface, namely nambu-goto action. would appropriate solving fully dirichlet problem. fully dirichlet problem, boundary loop xed target space, well-dened area surface. area, however, appropriate action functional neumann problem. since neumann problem xes string momentum, rather location loop boundary, area surface well-dened. appropriate action neumann problem legendre transform area, denote a. = dspiy i. (16) obtained legendre transformation good functional string momentum. bonus performing legendre transformation. since metric ads diverges near boundary, area minimum surface innite surface terminates boundary ads. regularize this, introduce cuto y-coordinates. boundary ads = 0, regularized area given integral region . now, well-known infrared regularization ads corresponds ultraviolet regularization gauge theory {$9711200$}. use symbol uv cuto gauge theory ir cuto string theory ads. loop smooth, area linearly divergent divergence 8 proportional circumference loop {$9711200$}. g2n = ds| x| + (nite). (17) turns legendre transformation precisely cancels linear divergence, leaving legendre transformed action nite. therefore vacuum expectation value wilson loop, given exponential a, nite case. earlier, seen gauge theory wilson loop perturbatively nite x2 = y2. fact nite ts well gauge theory result. 3.3. examples several types wilson loops solutions corresponding minimum surface problems found explicitly areas surfaces computed analytically. rst example parallel wilson lines. studied maldacena {$9711200$} rey yee {$9711200$}. computing area minimum surface connecting wilson lines performing legendre transformation, one nds = qg2n 42 ( 1 4)4 l r , (18) l length wilson lines r distance them. expression l r. parallel wilson lines compute potential quark antiquark. result shows potential goes 1/r, expected conformal invariance, coecient proportional g2n . interesting compare perturbative computation. g2n small, quark- antiquark potential proportional g2n due one glueon exchange. somehow g2n becomes large, g2n behavior turns g2n . one may view prediction ads/cft correspondence, principle tested eld theory computation large n. also nd minimum surface corresponding circular wilson loop. area surface, performing legendre transformation, turns independent radius circle, vacuum expectation value loop given hwi = exp(cid:18)qg2n(cid:19) . (19) two cases, wilson loops nite expect smooth loops. another case nd minimum surface loop cusp. near cusp singularity, geometry scale invariant integrate equation motion using elliptic integrals. case, divergence area precisely 9 canceled legendre transformation, logarithmic divergence remains. again, similar saw gauge theory side (6). coecient front logarithm dierent perturbative result, however. 3.4. loops x2 6= y2 seen that, wilson loop operator obeys constraint x2 = y2, evaluate vacuum expectation value large g2n computing area minimum surface ads. vacuum expectation value exponential legendre transform area, nite loop smooth. natural ask compute loop satisfy constraint. boundary conditions satisfy x2 = y2, minimum surface ending boundary ads. one may say vacuum expectation value wilson loop zero. reasonable answer. fact, cases nite temperature theories, answer gave results consistent expect gauge theories {$9711200$}. problems, however, need information detailed simply stating hwi = 0 x2 6= y2 large g2n. suppose example want see whether wilson loop computed way give solution large-n loop equation (10). loop smooth without intersections, equation simply lhwi = 0 satised smooth functional loop. non-trivial checks loop equation, therefore, involve loops cusps intersections. loop cusp, however, minimum surface end boundary ads violates condition x2 = y2 {$9904191$}, loop equation (10) derived loops obeying x2 = y2. thus, order test loop equation, need rened knowledge vacuum expectation value wilson loops. perturbative computation suggests loops obeying constraint ultraviolet divergent. analogy distinction chiral primary elds non-chiral elds gauge theory, expect computation vacuum expection value loops x2 6= y2 requires better understanding stringy corrections ads. 4. comments end presentation conference, asked whether wilson loop operator w (4) well-dened euclidean quantum eld theory. know functional integral hwi convergent? since scalar eld exponent comes real coecient yi, functional integral would convergent distribution eigenvalues decays suciently fastly large eigenvalues. another audience commented that, since wilson loop 10 constraint x2 = y2 bps-like (it phase factor associated trajectory w- boson, bps particle n = 4 theroy), likely operator makes sense, one x2 > y2 since eect exponent would weaker. hand, one may question whether operator x2 < y2 exists. fact, ads/cft correspondence suggests operators x2 = y2, x2 > y2 x2 < y2 behave dierently. pointed out, minimum surface terminate boundary ads = 0 constraint x2 = y2 satised. ads/cft corrspondence gives denite prescription compute hwi using legendre transform area minimum surface. x2 > y2, still nd minimum surface obeying boundary conditions (15), except surface ends somewhere interior ads rather boundary. one may therefore hope compute hwi using minimum surface. hand, case x2 < y2, solution minimum surface problem even relax condition surface terminate = 0. may viewed indication loop operator x2 < y2 problematic. would interesting study properties loops point view gauge theory see behaviors minimum surfaces. ........................................................... conclude, wilson loop provide us window observe stringy nature correspondence gauge theory string theory. n = 4 gauge theory four dimensions, understood various aspects loops obey x2 = y2. think nding way study loops without constraint constraint, would teach us gauge theory string theory. acknowledgments pleasure thank organizers strings 99 giving opportunity present work conference hospitality. would like thank nadav drukker david gross collaboration work. research supported part nsf grant phy-95-14797 doe grant de- ac03-76sf00098.
