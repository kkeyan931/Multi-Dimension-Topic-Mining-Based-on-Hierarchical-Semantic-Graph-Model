abstract

we study the decoupling eects in n = 1 (global) supersymmetric theories with
chiral superelds at the one-loop level. the examples of gauge neutral chiral super-
elds with the minimal (renormalizable) as well as non-minimal (non-renormalizable)
couplings are considered, and decoupling in gauge theories with u (1) gauge superelds
that couple to heavy chiral matter is studied. we calculate the one-loop corrected ef-
fective lagrangians that involve light elds and heavy elds with the mass of order m .
the elimination of heavy elds by equations of motion leads to decoupling eects with
terms that grow logarithmically with m . these corrections renormalize light elds and
couplings in the theory (in accordance with the decoupling theorem). when the eld
theory is an eective theory of the underlying fundamental theory, like superstring the-
ory, where the couplings are calculable, such decoupling eects modify the low energy
predictions for the eective couplings of light elds. in particular, for the class of string
vacua with an anomalous u (1) the vacuum restabilization triggers the decoupling ef-
fects, which can signicantly modify the low energy predictions for the couplings of the
surviving light elds. we also demonstrate that quantum corrections to the chiral po-
tential depending on massive background superelds and corresponding to supergraphs
with internal massless lines and external massive lines can also arise at the two-loop
level.

the paper is devoted to the calculation of one-loop eective action for several models of
the global n = 1 supersymmetric theory with chiral superelds and a subsequent study of
some their phenomenologically interesting aspects. in particular, we investigate in detail the
decoupling eects due to the the couplings of heavy and light chiral superelds in the theory
and subsequent implications for the low energy eective action of light superelds.

in principle the decoupling eects of heavy elds in eld theory are well understood.
according to the decoupling theorem [1, 2] (for additional references see, e.g., [3]) in the
eld theory of interacting light (with masses m) and heavy elds (with masses m) the heavy
elds decouple; the eective lagrangian of the light elds can be written in terms of the
original classical lagrangian of light elds with the loop eects of heavy elds absorbed into

2

redenitions of new light elds, masses and couplings, and the only new terms in this eective
lagrangian are non- renormalizable, proportional to the inverse powers of m (both at tree-
and loop-levels).

in a eld theory as an eective description of phenomena at certain energies, the rescaling
of the elds and couplings due to the heavy elds does not aect the structure of the cou-
plings, since those are free parameters whose values are determined by experiments. on the
other hand if the eld theory is describing an eective theory of an underlying fundamental
theory, like superstring theory, where the couplings at the string scale are calculable, the
decoupling eects of the heavy eld can be important and can signicantly aect the low
energy predictions for the couplings of light elds at low energies. therefore the quantitative
study of decoupling eects at the loop-level in eective supersymmetric theories is impor-
tant; it should improve our understanding of such eects for the eective lagrangians from
superstring theory and provide us with calculable corrections for the low energy predictions
of the theory. we also note that as the decoupling theorem is based on nite renormalization
of elds and parameters as all parameters in the eective theory (elds, masses, couplings)
are determined from the corresponding string theory and hence cannot be renormalized.
therefore we will use consistence with the decoupling theorem only to check the results.

eective theories of n = 1 supersymmetric four-dimensional perturbative string vacua
can be obtained by employing techniques of two-dimensional conformal eld theory [4]. in
particular the kahlerian and the chiral (super-) potential can be calculated explicitly at the
tree level. while the chiral potential terms calculated at the string tree-level are protected
from higher genus corrections (for a representative work on the subject see, e.g., [5, 6], and
references therein), the kahlerian potential is not. such higher genus corrections to the
kahlerian potential could be signicant, however, their structure has not been studied very
much.
in this paper we shall not address these issues and assume that the string theory
calculation provides us with a (reliable, calculable) form of the eective theory at mstring,
which would in turn serve as a starting point of our study.

one of the compelling motivations for a detailed study of decoupling eects is the phe-
nomenon of vacuum restabilization [7] for a class of four-dimensional (quasi-realistic) heterotic
superstring vacua with an anomalous u(1). (on the open type i string side these eects
are closely related to the blowing-up procedure of type i orientifolds and were recently stud-
ied in [8].) for such string vacua of perturbative heterotic string theory, the fayet-iliopoulos
(fi) d- term is generated at genus-one [9], thus triggering certain elds to acquire vacuum
expectation values (vevs) of order mstring  ggaugemp lanck  5  1017 gev along d- and
f - at directions of the eective n = 1 supersymmetric theory. (here ggauge is the gauge
coupling and mp lanck the planck scale.) due to these large string-scale vevs a number
of additional elds obtain large string-scale masses. some of them in turn couple through
(renormalizable) interactions to the remaining light elds, and thus through decoupling ef-
fects aect the eective theory of light elds at low energies. (for the study of the eective
lagrangians and their phenomenological implications for a class of such four-dimensional
string vacua see, e.g., [10] [12] and references therein.)

the tree level decoupling eects within n = 1 supersymmetric theories, were studied
within an eective string theory in [13]. in a related work [14] it was shown that the lead-

3

ing order corrections of order 1
m are to the eective chiral potential, however there are also
important next order eects in the eective chiral potential [15].
in addition, in [15] the
nonrenormalizable modications of the kahlerian potential (as was also pointed out in [16])
were systematically studied. these tree level decoupling eects (as triggered by, e.g., vac-
uum restabilization for a class of string vacua) lead to new nonrenormalizable interactions
which are competitive with the nonrenormalizable terms that are calculated directly in the
superstring theory.

in this paper we consider the one-loop decoupling eects in n = 1 supersymmetric theory.
we study both the eects of chiral (gauge neutral) superelds and on the eects of gauge
superelds. (in another context see [17].) it turns out that an essential modication of low
energy predictions takes place not only for chiral superelds [18] but also for gauge superelds.
as stated earlier such eective lagrangians arise naturally due to the vacuum restabilization
for a class of supersymmetric string vacua and trigger couplings between heavy elds with
mass scale m  1017 gev and the light (massless) elds [19]. (note however, that we do not
include supergravity eects which could also be signicant.)
as a result we nd that the one-loop eective action after a redenition of elds, masses
and couplings coincides with the one-loop eective action of corresponding theory where
heavy superelds absent at all, in accordance with the decoupling theorem. however, since
the masses and the couplings of the elds are calculable in string theory (at the mass scale
mstring), the decoupling eects add additional corrections to the eective action of the light
superelds. these corrections grow logarithmically with m (mass of the heavy superelds)
and modify the eective couplings in an essential way, which for a class of string vacua under
consideration can be signicant.

another interesting result presented in this paper pertains to the chiral eective potential.
when the chiral potential depends on massive superelds, quantum corrections due to these
elds appear earlier than in the case when one considers light elds only.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 the general structure of the eective action
studied is given and the general approach to addressing the decoupling eects is presented.
section 3 is devoted to the study of the eective action for the minimal model with one
heavy and one light (gauge neutral) chiral supereld. in section 4 the leading order decou-
pling corrections to the eective action for non-minimal models (with more general couplings)
are considered. section 5 is devoted to the investigation of the one-loop decoupling eects
in n = 1 supersymmetric theory with u(1) gauge vector superelds and chiral superelds
charged under u(1). a summary and discussion of the obtained results are given in section
6. in appendix a details of the calculation of the one-loop kahlerian eective potential for
the minimal model are presented, in appendix b the calculation of the one-loop kahlerian
eective action via diagram technique for the minimal model is described, and in appendix
c details of the calculation for the eective action of non-minimal models are given.

2.1 general structure of the eective action

n = 1 supersymmetric actions with chiral supermultiplets arise as a subsector of an eective
theory of n = 1 supersymmetric string vacua. such calculations are carried out for per-
turbative string vacua primarily by employing conformal eld theory techniques. (though
less powerful, techniques, e.g., sigma-model approach, in which the integration over massive
string modes is carried out in the the background of the ten-dimensional manifold with the
structure m 4  k where m 4 is a four-dimensional minkowski space and k is a suitable six-
dimensional compact (calabi-yau) manifold, can also be employed.) the resulting eective
theories contain as an ingredient n = 1 chiral superelds i with action

s[, ] = z d8zk( i, i) + (z d6zw (i) + h.c.)

(2.1)

here i = i(z), za  (xa, ,  ); a = 0, 1, 2, 3;  = 1, 2,
 = 1, 2, d8z = d4xd2d2 . real
function k( i, i) is called kahlerian potential, holomorphic function w (i) is called chiral
potential [20]. the expression (2.1) represents the most general action of gauge neutral chiral
superelds which does not contain higher derivatives at a component level [20]. we refer to
this action as the chiral supereld model of a general form. in a special case k( i, i) =  ,
w (i)  3 we obtain the well-known wess-zumino model. for w (i) = 0 the present
theory represents itself as n = 1 supersymmetric four-dimensional sigma-model (see, e.g.,[6].
the action (2.1), which originates from superstring theory, can be treated as a classical
eective action of the fundamental theory, suitable for description of phenomena at energies
much less than the planck scale. such models of chiral superelds is widely used for the study
of possible phenomenological implications of superstring theories (see, e.g., recent papers
[8, 10, 11, 12, 18] and references therein). one of the most important aspects the study of
these models pertains to the investigation of the decoupling eects, which is the main subject
of the present paper.

the starting point in the study of the decoupling eects is the model with the classical
action (2.1) and for the sake of simplicity two chiral superelds: the light one  and the
heavy one , i.e. i = {, }. the aim is to to calculate the low-energy eective action in
the one-loop approximation and to compute the one-loop corrected eective action of light
supereld, only.

we refer to the model in which the kahlerian potential is of the canonical (minimal) form:

k(, , , ) =   +  

(2.2)

as the minimal model, and the model in which

k(, , , ) =   +   + k(, , , )

(2.3)
with k 6= 0  as the non-minimal one (in analogy with [10]). we assume that the function
k(, , , ) can be expanded into power series in superelds , , ,  where the leading
order term is at least of the third order in the chiral superelds (and thus proportional to at
least one inverse power of m)

k(, , , ) =

(2.4)

the chiral potential m is taken to be of the form:

w =

2 + w (, )

(2.5)

where w is also at least of the third order in {, } superelds. the functions w could have
the following structure

w (, ) = 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 +

3
m

+ . . .

(2.6)

with m as a massive parameter. hence the possible vertices of interaction of superelds have
the form

. . .

the eective action [, , , ] is dened as the legendre transform from the generating

functional of connected green functions [21] w [j, j]:

exp(

(s[, , , ] +

+ (z d6z(j + j) + h.c.)))

[, , , ] = w [j, j]  (z d6z(j + j) + h.c.)

(2.7)

the [, , , ] can be calculated using the loop-expansion method. this method employs
the splitting of all the chiral superelds into a sum of the background superelds ,  and
the quantum ones q, q, using the rule

   + hq
   + hq

as a result the action (2.1) after such changes can be written as

sq = z d8zk( + hq,  + h q,  + hq,  + h q) +

+ [z d6zw ( + hq,  + hq) + h.c.]

and the eective action takes the form:

(2.8)

(2.10)

(for details see [20, 21]). the eective action (2.10) can be cast in the form [, , , ] =
s[, , , ] + [, , , ]. here [, , , ] is a quantum correction in eective action
which can be expanded into power series in h as

[, , , ] =

hn(n)[, , , ]

(2.11)

that the one-loop quantum correction (1) to the eective action is dened through the

following expression [21]:

ei(1)

q )

(2.12)

here s(2)
of the form

q

corresponds to the part of sq (2.9) which is quadratic in quantum superelds. it is

s(2)

q = z d8z(k q q + k q q + k q q + k q q) +

+ [z d6zw2

q + wqq + w2

q + h.c.]

as a result we arrive at the one-loop eective action of the form

[, , , ] = s + h(1) = z d8zk(, , , ) + [z d6zw (, ) + h.c.] +

+ h(z d8zk (1)(, , , ) + (z d6zw (1)(, ) + h.c.))

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

here we suppose that the one-loop correction in the eective action (1) can be represented
in the form

(1) = z d8zk (1)(, , , ) + (z d6zw (1)(, ) + h.c.) + . . .

dots denote terms that depend on the supercovariant derivatives of the chiral superelds.

the loop corrected eective action has the following structure

(2.17)

(2.18)

kef f is the kahlerian eective potential that depends only on the chiral superelds , , , 
but not on their (covariant) derivatives. wef f is the chiral eective potential that depends on
on (holomorphic) chiral superelds {, }, only. dots denote the terms that depend on the
the space-time derivatives of chiral superelds, only. furthermore, one can prove that the one-
loop correction to the chiral potential is zero it is equal to zero (for the n = 1 supersymmetric
theory which does not include gauge superelds). however, higher corrections can exist (cf.
[22][24]), i.e.

wef f (, ) = w (, ) +

hnw (n)(, )

(2.19)



xn=2

here k (n) and w (n) are loop corrections to the kahlerian and chiral potential, respectively.
since in this paper we concentrate on the one-loop corrected eective action, only, we are
mainly interested in the correction to the kahlerian potential which is the leading term in the
one-loop corrected low-energy eective action. (at low energies (e  m) higher derivative
terms are suppressed.)
our ultimate goal to obtain the eective action for light superelds, only. for that purpose
one must eliminate heavy superelds from the one-loop eective action [, , , ] (2.14)
by means of the eective equations of motion. these equations can be solved by an iterative
method up to a certain order in the inverse mass m of heavy supereld. substituting a
solution of these equations into the eective action (2.14) we then obtains the one-loop
corrected eective action of light superelds, only.
in the following subsection we shall
describe the procedure in detail.

2.2 the eective equations of motion

the eective equations of motion for heavy superelds in the model with the eective action
(2.14,2.15) are of the form

(2.20)

the eective equations of motion for light superelds have an analogous form. we consider
the case when the interactions with the gauge superelds are absent (see however section 5)
and w (1) = 0 (which is absent at one-loop level (cf., discussion above)).

the equations (2.20) can be solved via an iterative method, described below. we can

represent heavy supereld  in the form

(2.21)
where 0 is zeroth-order approximation, 1 is rst-order one etc. we assume that |d2| 
m  since the supereld  is heavy, and thus the assumption is valid. the zeroth-order
approximation 0 can be found from the condition

 = 0 + 1 + . . . + n + . . .

w
 |=0 = 0

after a substitution of the expansion (2.21) into equations (2.20) we arrive at the following
equation for the (n + 1)-th-order solution for n+1

and an analogous equation for n+1. these sets of equations can be used to calculate n for
2 2 + w (see eqs. (2.5-2.6), eq.
any n  1. since the chiral potential is of the form w = m
(2.23)) can be rewritten in the form

with an analogous equation for n+1. as a result we can nd ,  in principle to any order.
thus, a substitution of the heavy superelds ,  expressed in terms of light superelds
by means of equations (2.22-2.23) allows one to obtain the one-loop corrected eective action
of light superelds, only.

k (1)
 |=0+...+n 

2.3 calculation of the one-loop kahlerian eective potential

let us now consider the method to calculate of the one-loop eective action. the most
eective method consists of expressing the quantities in terms of matrices (matrix approach).
first we write the heavy quantum supereld q and light one q as a column vector: q =

  q
q !. as a result, the part of the classical action that is quadratic in quantum superelds

(2.13) takes the form

s(2)[q, q] = z d8zk q q + (z d6zw



2

q + h.c.)

here k  and w  are matrices of the form
k  =   k  k 

k  k  ! w



=   w w
w w !

the one-loop eective action [21] (4.4) is of the form

exp(i(1)) = z dqd qs(2)[q, q]

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

where s(2)[q, q] is given by (2.24), dq denotes the integration over both q and q.

9

to perform the integration we we employ the technique analogous to that used for the
study of the wess-zumino model [22, 23]. first we consider a theory of a real scalar supereld

q which represents itself as a column q =   u

v !. the action for q reads as

s0
q = 

1

16 z d8zqt d d2dq

(2.27)

where qt is a string (row) of the form qt = (u v). the eective action uq for the supereld
q can be obtained by the faddeev-popov procedure. we choose the gauge xing functions
4d2q  , hence the eective action uq is dened with the
[q] = 1
4
following integral:

d2q   and [q] = 1

eiuq = z dq(

1
4

d2q  )(

1

d2q  ) exp(isv)detm0

here m0 is a faddeev-popov matrix

m0 =

(2.28)

(2.29)

12 is an unit 2  2 matrix. by denition, uq is constant: since the theory of q is gauge
invariant the corresponding eective action does not depend on  (cf. [22, 23]).
by multiplying the corresponding left-hand sides and right-hand sides of eqs. (2.26) and

(2.28) we obtain

exp(i(1)[, ] + iuq) = z dd dudv(

 detm0 exp(is(2)[, ])

d2q  )(

d2q  ) exp(isq) 

(2.30)

then we integrate over ,  by means of the delta functions (cf. [22, 23, 20]) and since eiuv
and detm0 are constants we arrive at the following expression for the one-loop eective action
for the superelds , :

which leads to

exp(i(1)) = z dq exp(is[q])

t r log  = trz ds

and an analogous system of equations for a, b, c, which can be obtained from this one by
changing w  into w  and vice versa. here f = 1  k . since the initial condition for  is
|s=0 = 1 the initial conditions for a, a, b, b, c, c) are a|s=0 = a|s=0 = c|s=0 = c|s=0 = 0.
the solution for b, b  evidently has the form b = b  = 0. the manifest form of the
matrices a, a c, c, necessary for exact calculations, is of the form
a21 a22 ! ; c =   c11 c12
c21 c22 !

a =   a11 a12

(2.39)

here index 1 denotes sector of heavy supereld  and 2  sector of light supereld . now
let us solve the system for matrices a, c. the solution for a, c can be easy obtained in an
analogous way since the system with b = b  = 0 is invariant under the change a  a,
c  c.

let us study the solution for a, c which should be chosen in the form

a = ai + a0
c = ci + c0

11

(2.40)

here ai, ci is a partial solution of the inhomogeneous system, and a0, c0 is a general solution
of the homogeneous system. it is straightforward to see that ai = 11, ci = 0. and a0,
c0 should satisfy the system of equations

a0 = a0f  + c0w



c0 = a0 g + c0f 

(2.41)

a0, c0 should be chosen to be of the form a0 = a0 exp(is), c0 = c0 exp(is) where a0, c0, 
are some functions of the background superelds and the dalembertian operator, but are
independent of s. as a result we arrive at the equations for a0, c0:

a0(1  f ) + c0w
c0(1  f ) + a0 w

(2.43)

in principle, parameters  can be found from this equation. their exact form is determined
by the structure of the matrix w  and f . it turns out that for the specic cases studied
in detail the subsequent sections (minimal (section 3) and non-minimal (section 4) cases)
these parameters are dierent. as a result the nal form of the solution can be cast in the
form:

1


a0k exp(iks) 
c0k exp(iks)

a = xk
c = xk

(2.44)

(2.45)

where k are all the roots of the equation (2.43) and a0k, c0k are values of a0, c0 which can
be found from (2.42) for the corresponding root k. a0k, c0k are xed by means of initial
conditions.

since only the coecients a and a in (2.35) contribute to the trace t r log  the one-loop

kahlerian contribution to the eective action (2.32) can be written in the form

k (1) =

tr(a + a)u(x, x; s)|x=x

(2.46)

where u(x, x; s) = exp(is)4(x  x) (see [22, 23]) and tr denotes a trace of the matrix.
the operator u(x, x; s) satises the equation

one-loop kahlerian eective potential it is necessary to nd a and a and to expand them
into a power series in .

in this section we addressed in detail the techniques needed to calculate the one-loop
corrected eective action, to eliminated the heavy elds and to obtain the eective action of
light elds, only. in the subsequent sections these techniques will be applied to obtain the
explicit form of the one-loop corrected actions for specic models. in section 5 we shall also
include interactions with the u(1) vector superelds and modify the procedure accordingly.

3 one-loop eective action for minimal models

in this section we study decoupling eects for the model with minimal kahlerian potential
(2.2) k =   +  . the rst part consists of calculating the one-loop correction to the
kahlerian eective potential. in the second part we solve the eective equations of motion
for the heavy superelds. as a result we arrive at the eective action of the light superelds.

3.1 calculation of the eective action

3.1.1 the one-loop kahlerian eective potential

here we are going to calculate the one-loop contribution to kahlerian eective potential by
means of the eective equations of motion. we study the minimal model with the chiral
potential in the form

w =

1

(m2 + 2) +

3!

g3

with the corresponding functions in w  (see eq.(2.25))

w =  + g
w = 
w = m

(3.1)

(3.2)

the total classical action with the chiral potential (3.1) is of the form

s = z d8z(  +  ) + [z d6z(

1
2

(m2 + 2) +

1
3!

g3) + h.c.]

(3.3)

note that the chiral potential used is of the minimal form: it involves the renormalizable
terms only and the renormalizable coupling between the light and heavy superelds is linear
in the heavy elds, which yields a dominant contribution in the study of the decoupling
eects. these types of couplings are typical for a class of eective string models after the
vacuum restabilization was taken into account, and thus this minimal model provides a
prototype example for the study of decoupling eects in n = 1 supersymmetric theories.

13

(the results for this model and the physics consequences were presented in [18]. for the sake
of completeness we present here the intermediate steps in the derivation.)

in order to nd the one-loop kahlerian eective potential we should determine the operator
(s) that satises the equation (2.35). for the case of this minimal model this equation leads
to the following system of equations for matrices a, c:

1

a = cw
c =  w

(3.4)

with the analogous equations for a, c.
initial conditions are a|s=0 = a|s=0 = c|s=0 =
c|s=0 = 0. calculations described in appendix a show that the one-loop contribution to
kahlerian eective potential is of the form:

here parameter  is is the renormalization scale parameter (see appendix a). this is the
focal result of this section and it is further used for the study of decoupling eects. note
also that the same result can be obtained via a diagrammatic approach, which is described
in appendix b.

3.1.2 corrections to the chiral potential

let us address now loop corrections to the chiral eective potential. by denition the chiral
eective potential depends only on chiral background superelds, i.e.
in order to consider
corrections to the chiral eective potential one must set  =  = 0. possible vertices
contributing to one-loop eective potential should be quadratic in quantum superelds [21].
they have the form

k  

k  

k  

2, k2, (k   1) ,
1
 , k, (k ) ,
2
2, k2, (k   1) ,

1
2

w2,

w,

1
2

w2

here all derivatives of k and w are taken at  =  = 0. the standard method to address
these corrections ([24][26]) is the following. in corrections contributing to the chiral potential
should be of the form:

namely, after a transformation to an integral over the chiral superspace by the rule

r d8zf (, ) = r d6z(  d2

4 )f (, ) these corrections take the form

z d8zf ()( 

d2
4

)g()

z d6zf ()g()

(3.6)

(3.7)

here f (), g() are functions of the chiral supereld , only.

however, factor 1 in (3.6) can arise only from propagators of massless superelds as
propagators of massive superelds are proportional to (  m2)1. namely, in the case of
the massive chiral superelds, instead of (3.6) we must consider the expression

z d8zf ()( 

d2

4(  m2)

)g()

a transformation to the form of an integral over the chiral superspace leads to

which after fourier transformation is of the form

z d6zf ()(



  m2 )g()

d4p
(2)4 f ()(

z

p2

p2 + m2 )g()

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

this expression evidently vanishes for superelds slowly varying in space-time, (p2  0)
and m 6= 0. hence supergraphs contributing to the chiral eective potential cannot contain
massive propagators.

15

let us now carry out a dimensional analysis of possible one-loop diagrams contributing
to the chiral eective potential. each loop corresponds to a contribution with a scaling
dimension 2 since each loop includes an integration over momenta which contribute a scaling
dimension 4, however each contraction of the loop to the point by the rule 12d2
112 = 1612
1
decreases a number of d, d-factors by 4 and the corresponding scaling dimension by 2. each
propagator of a massless supereld gives no contribution (scaling dimension 0) since it has
the form (cf. [20])

d2

g(z1, z2) = 

d2
d2
2
1
16

8(z1  z2)

(3.11)

(it is more convenient for dimensional analysis to associate d-factors with propagators instead
of vertices.) each vertex proportional to an external chiral supereld corresponds to one
factor d2 instead of two since one of them is used to transform a vertex to a form of an
integral over d4. as a result such a vertex decreases a scaling dimension by 1. one of
the factors d2 does not contribute to the scaling dimension since it is used to transform
the expression (3.6) to the form (3.7). then, during such a transformation one more square
of external momenta arises. therefore the scaling dimension due to contributions from a
one-loop supergraph has the form 2l + 1  nw  . where l is a number of loops (in our case
l = 1), nw  is a number of external chiral lines w . by denition the eective potential
is an eective lagrangian in the low energy (infrared) limit p2  0. hence a non-trivial
one-loop chiral eective lagrangian can arise only for

3  nw  = 0

(3.12)

otherwise the contribution would either vanish or be singular in the infrared limit. we also
note that the vertices proportional to derivatives of k(, ) do not contribute to scaling
dimension.

furthermore, chiral potential contributions should contain one factor d2 more than d2
after a transformation of all vertices to the form of integrals over d4. the reason for this
is the following. after each pair d2d2 is transformed to a dalembertian operator, one
factor d2 should be employed to transform the integral over d4 to an integral over d2 (see
(3.6)-(3.7)).

it is easy to see that one of two factors d2 associated with the vertex proportional to
k can be transported only to an external line k during the d-algebra transformations.
however, all the derivatives of k and w are considered at  = 0, and therefore d2k = 0.
as a result we can put k = 0.

now let us consider the possible one-loop diagrams contributing to the chiral eective
potential. at the one-loop level nw  = 3 (see above) and each external line w  corresponds
to d2. hence the supergraph should contain four d2-factors, i.e. two vertices proportional
to k  . however, a straightforward construction shows that such a diagram must contain
d2
d2
the line proportional to
16 12 = 0. hence a contribution of such a diagram is equal to zero,
2
1
and a one-loop contribution to the chiral eective potential is absent: w (1)() = 0. we note
that this situation is analogous to the general model of one chiral supereld studied in [27].
however, higher order (loop) corrections to the chiral eective potential can arise not
only for diagrams with external massless lines but also for those with heavy external lines,

16

in spite of the fact that it was commonly believed that quantum corrections to the chiral
eective potential for massive superelds are absent. for example, consider the supergraph

we have therefore demonstrated that chiral corrections to the eective action that depend
on massive superelds can also arise. however, such eects can appear at the two-loop level,
at most, and after solving the eective equations of motion for heavy elds such corrections
are proportional to 1
m 3 . therefore, they are highly suppressed compared to the decoupling
eects due to the one-loop corrected kahlerian eective potential. in the following we shall
concentrate on the latter eects only.

(162)2 (3)( g

by analogous reasoning, corrections to the chiral eective potential that involve a coupling
3! )232 which is of the
of the heavy supereld to the light ones, are of the form 6
same form as the corresponding classical chiral eective potential term. they are described
by supergraphs analogous to those given above, but with one heavy external line and two
massless ones. at two-loop level kef f = k + k (1) + k (2), and wef f = w + w (2) where k (2)
and w (2) are two-loop corrections to the kahlerian potential and chiral potential, respectively.
w (2) depends non-trivially on . hence the presence of such a correction to w should modify
the eective equations of motion (2.22,2.23). after substitution of the solution of eective
equations of motion into the eective action, w (2) turns out to be suppressed by 1
m , i.e.
it can have the form  4
m . hence the eective dynamics of the two-loop corrected theory
allows us to conclude that a two-loop contribution to the eective superpotential can yield
corrections of order in 1
it can be competitive with the leading tree-level (classical)
decoupling eects.

3.2 the eective action for light superelds

now we solve the eective equations of motion for this minimal model that allows us to
eliminate heavy superelds from eective action up to the some order in the inverse powers

18

of the mass parameters, and as a consequence obtain the one-loop eective action of light
superelds, only. the one-loop corrected eective action is given by (3.6). the eective
equations of motion for the heavy supereld with the chiral potential (3.1) have the form

as described in the previous section these equations can be solved for the heavy supereld via
an iterative method and a subsequent substitution of this solution into the one-loop corrected
eective action. (analogous equations for  are not essential since our aim is to minimize
the eective action with respect to heavy superelds.)

now let us solve the equations (3.20) via the iterative method. using |d2|  m, since
we consider the case with large m  p, one nds that the lowest (zeroth) order solution of
these equations is

(3.21)

(3.22)

the rst order correction (cf. (2.22)-(2.23)) is obtained from the equation

d2( 0 +

where 0 is given by (3.21). as for higher order corrections, they can be found by continuing
the iterative procedure.

it turns to be that for the case with g 6= 0, 1 is of order 1

alternatively, we do not x  and address the eective action (3.28)-(3.30) at energy

as  is taken as a free parameter, describing the eective theory at energy scales , we see
that the second term of this expression (proportional to log 2m 2
2 ) can become competitive with
those of the classical action as   m  . therefore from both perspectives, i.e. when
we x  and when we treat  as a free parameter, the decoupling eects grow logarithmically
with m and as m   they become dominant. hence the appearance of such terms is not
an eect caused by a choice of normalization parameter  but it is a genuine property of the
model itself.

the total one-loop eective action can be nally written as

(3.32)

here we took into account that all the terms that depend on the heavy supereld , after
the substitution of the solution of the eective equations of motion, are at least of the rst
order in the inverse mass m.

21

according to the decoupling theorem when we eliminate heavy superelds via eective
equations of motion we can split any quantum correction to the eective action into a sum
of two terms. the rst term is a quantum correction in the corresponding theory describing
dynamics of light superelds only, with heavy superelds put to zero, i.e.
the standard
coleman-weinberg potential associated with the interaction of the light elds, only. the
second one corresponds to a sum of terms that are proportional to at least one power of 1
m .
to convince ourselves that our results are in accordance with the decoupling theorem, we
introduce the following eld and coupling redenitions. first, we see that the kinetic energy
term (proportional to ||2) of the one-loop eective action is of the form

||2[1 

h

322n42(1 + log

2m 2

2 )o]

we can redene the kinetic energy term by the rule

 = z

where  is a new chiral supereld, and z is a nite renormalization constant equal to

z = [1 

h
322 42(1 + log

1/2

2m 2
2 )]

(3.33)

(3.34)

then, if we also redene coupling g by the rule g = z 3g we see that the chiral potential g3
remains invariant. we note that coupling  corresponds to the interaction between light and
heavy superelds, and after a redenition of the light supereld (3.33) it will present itself
only in terms that are at least rst order in the inverse mass m. (note also that analogous
redenitions of the supereld and couplings could be carried out at higher orders of the
eective action.) as a result we arrive at the one-loop eective action of the form

however, we can expand z (3.34) into a power series in h as

z = 1

substituting this expansion into (3.35) and taking into account only terms of zeroth and rst

this eective action coincides at the zeroth order with the form of the one-loop eective
action for the pure light theory where quantum corrections originated from the couplings
of the light elds, only. therefore the result for the eective action of light superelds given
by expressions (3.283.30) is in formal agreement with the decoupling theorem.

note, however, that the parameters of the theory, i.e. elds, masses and couplings,
are determined from the string theory; they are xed-calculable at mstring and therefore
they cannot be adjusted via redenitions performed above. thus, the corrections due to
decoupling eects correct in a quantitative manner the predictions for the low-energy values
of the couplings. for a class of perturbative string vacua with an anomalous u(1), after the
vacuum restabilization, the eective theory has couplings of the heavy and light elds of the
type discussed in this section. typical values of the couplings g and  (at mstring  1017
gev) are of the order of the gauge coupling  0.8 and the mass parameter of the heavy elds
m  mstring. the decoupling eects then modify the low-energy (  1 tev) predictions for
the corresponding tri-linear couplings of the light elds by an amount of order g2
2 ) 
0.25. thus for such classes of string vacua decoupling eects could correct the predictions
for the couplings by 10%  50%.

to convince ourselves that the results are consistent with the decoupling theorem, we can
again carry out the eld redenition (3.33) with the nite renormalization constant (3.34).
as a result we arrive at the one-loop eective action of light superelds which is a sum of
(3.41) and (3.42) and has the form

sef f [, ] = z d8z  + o(

1
m

)

(3.43)

therefore we nd that in the absence of self-interaction of the light supereld the eective
action for , , after a suitable choice of  and redenitions of elds and couplings becomes a
sum of the classical action of the light supereld and terms at the one loop level that are at
least second order in the inverse mass parameter. hence the result (3.41)-(3.42) for the eec-
tive action of the light supereld is again consistent with the decoupling theorem. however,
note again, since the parameters of the theory (elds, masses, couplings) are determined from
string theory, the one-loop decoupling eects again modify in a quantitative manner the low
energy predictions for the couplings.

4 one-loop eective action for non-minimal models

in this section we generalize a discussion to the case of non-minimal models. we consider
the examples with the kahlerian potential of the form (2.3). however, as it turns out an
exact computation of the one-loop correction in the eective action for a general form of k
leads to essential diculties. therefore we consider two specic examples.

24

4.1 the model with heavy quantum superelds and external light

superelds

4.1.1 calculation of the eective action

we consider for example the theory with the action

s = z d8z(cid:16)  + (1 +

2

(m + c)2 +

( + )) (cid:17) +

which corresponds to the functions k and w of the form

w =

2

(m + c)2 +

k =   +

( + ) 


m

(4.1)

(4.2)

in principle it is possible to consider the eective action for the general case when both
light and heavy superelds are split into sum of background and quantum part. however,
calculation in this case is very complicated, hence in order to simplify the computing we put
light superelds ,  to be pure background ones. heavy superelds ,  are split into sum
of background superelds 0, 0 and quantum ones ,  by a standard way

  0 + ,   0 + 

as a result the quadratic action of quantum superelds looks like

s = z d8z(cid:16)[1 +


m

( + )] (cid:17) +(cid:16)z d6z

1
2

(m + c)2 + h.c.(cid:17)

(4.3)

and does not depend on heavy background superelds. therefore one-loop quantum cor-
rection in eective action is also 0, 0 independent due to special (quadratic) structure of
action (4.1) in heavy superelds. in this case the column vector  (see section 2.3) consists
of the heavy supereld , only, and all the derivatives with respect to  are equivalent to
those with respect to , only.

the one-loop correction in the eective action (1) can be dened in this case by the

equation

ei(1)

= z dd  exp(is(2))

where s2 is the part of the action quadratic in quantum superelds ,  (see section 2.3)

(4.4)

s2 = z d8z(k   +

k

k) +

(4.5)

and k , k  , k are functions of light background superelds , , only.

25

using (4.4) one can write (1) as

(1) =

i
2

t r log g()

(4.6)

the straightforward calculation of the eective potential based on (4.6) is very complicated
because elements of the matrix g() are dened in dierent chiral superspaces hence their
chiralities are mixed. however, in this model it is possible to employ a technique analogous
to that one used in [22, 23]. namely, let us consider a theory of a real scalar supereld with
the standard action

sv = 

1

16 z d8zvd d2dv

(4.7)

this theory can be quantized using the faddeev-popov procedure (cf.
[22, 23]), and the
eective action wv corresponding to this theory can be determined by the following integral:

eiwv = z dv(

1
4

d2v  )(

1
4

d2v  ) exp(isv)detm0

here m0 is a faddeev-popov matrix,

m0 =  

0
 1
4 d2

d2

!

(4.8)

(4.9)

it is evident that wv is a constant: since the model (4.7) is gauge invariant its eective action
does not depend on  (cf. [22, 23]).

if we multiply the corresponding left-hand sides and right-hand sides of (4.4) and (4.8)

we obtain

exp(i(1)[, ] + iwv) = z dd dv(

 exp(i{z d8z(k   +

2

(4.10)

here sv is given by (4.7). then we integrate over ,  by means of delta functions (cf.
[22, 23, 20]) and since eiwv and detm0 are constants we arrive at the following expression for
the one-loop eective action for the superelds , :

exp(i(1)) = z dv exp(

this expression can be used to calculate the explicit form of the one-loop eective action.
we note that the last two terms in this expression depend on derivatives of the background
superelds and therefore do not contribute to the kahlerian eective potential.

to nd the one-loop eective action from (4.11) we use the schwinger representation

t r log  = t rz ds

s

eis

(4.13)

since the kahlerian eective action (by denition) does not depend on supercovariant deriva-
tives of superelds, one calculates the kahlerian eective potential via proper-time method
where one can omit the last two terms in (4.12) and obtain (cf. [22, 23])

(4.17)

we note that the result for the one-loop contribution to kahlerian eective potential does
not depend on . this result, however, is natural since the vertex 2 is linear in quantum
supereld  and hence it can lead to one-particle-reducible diagrams, only. the same follows
from (4.15) with k and w given by (4.2).

to study the eective action of light superelds in the model one can expand the k (1)

into a power series in the inverse mass.

4.1.2 solving the eective equations of motion

let us consider decoupling eects for the non-minimal model with the one-loop kahlerian
eective potential given by (4.17). the result (4.17) can be represented as a power series in

as a result the eective action being the sum of the classical part (4.22) and the quantum
one (4.23) takes the form

sef f [, ] = z d8z  + o(

1
m

)

(4.25)

which formally is thus consistent with the decoupling theorem. (however, note again that
elds and couplings , c are determined from string theory, and thus the classical action gets
essential one-loop corrections.)

4.2 the model with light and heavy quantum superelds and light

and heavy external superelds

4.2.1 calculation of the eective action

it turns out that for the non-minimal models it is possible obtain explicit expressions for
the the one-loop corrected action in the leading orders in 1
m when both light and heavy
superelds have background and quantum parts, by employing the diagram approach.

let us consider a specic non-minimal model with the action

+ [z d6z(

g
3!

m
2

(w1()  + w1( ))] +


m
2) + h.c.]

(4.26)

the propagators of the model have the standard form (b.1). the zeroth order in 1
m expansion
of the one-loop kahlerian eective potential corresponds to the case where vertices, propor-
m , are absent. the corresponding supergraphs consist of <   >-propagators with
tional to 1
alternating background elds  and  (cf. [28, 29]):

. . .

here the external legs correspond to alternating  and .

the result is given by a sum of all such supergraphs. after calculations that are completely
0 displayed
[29, 28]. other methods of calculating the kahlerian eective potential

parallel with those carried out above we arrive at the leading order correction k (1)
in eq. (b.8). (cf.
were given in [30].)

to study corrections that are higher orders in 1

m expansion, it is more convenient to split
superelds ,  into a sum of background ,  and quantum q, q superelds. as a result

29

we arrive at the following quadratic action of the quantum superelds q, q in external
superelds , 

s = z d8z[q q + q q +

q) + h.c.]

(4.27)

let us study corrections at dierent orders in 1
m expansion. it is evident that the presence
of corrections at higher orders is due to the presence of vertices proportional to  in the
supergraphs. one can assume that corrections at higher orders in 1
m expansion can arise in
two cases. in the rst case the diagram contains the background heavy supereld  and the
q. note also that in the diagrams each factor d2 corresponds

to a quantum supereld q. therefore a contribution of such vertices is of the form

vertex is of the form r d8z w  2



|
d2

|
d2

here the double external line with sign  corresponds to w  (an analogous fragment of a
diagram arises for the contribution proportional to w  ). then a transportation of any of
the two d2-factors during d-algebra transformations leads to the factor d2, i.e. diagrams
containing such vertices do not contribute to the kahlerian eective potential. therefore
corrections at the rst and higher orders in the inverse mass expansion can appear only in
supergraphs with light external eld lines, only.

let us study the possible diagrams of that type. we must pay attention to the fact that
the propagator of the light supereld  depends on the background supereld. we denote it
with a bold line which has the following diagrammatic representation

=

+

+. . .

(

)n +. . .

here an external line denotes the background superelds , . summation of this chain of
diagrams allows one to show that the total propagator of the light supereld is of the form

12

(4.28)

the propagator of the heavy supereld  is given by (b.1). one can easily see that in
addition to the diagrams discussed above, which do not contain vertices proportional to 
m ,
there are two other types of supergraphs. the rst one consists of an arbitrary number of
repeating links of the form <   ><   >, i.e.





30

where bold external lines with sign  correspond to external 
1() term, and dashed
internal ones to <   > propagators. the second type of diagrams consist of an arbitrary
number of repeating links of the form
<   >t<   ><   >t<  ><   >t<  ><  >t<   > which can be diagram-
matically represented as

m w 

    
. . . .

  

here the dashed-and-dotted line denotes <  > and the jagged line denotes <   >.

the contribution of a diagram of the rst type, which consists of n such links, is of the

form

we can now nd the leading terms in the inverse mass expansion for the above contribu-
tions. it is easy to see that as n grows the order in the inverse mass contribution increases.
jn is proportional to m 6nn1. after fourier transformation and the integration over
momenta the leading term will be of the order m 28n, i.e. it will involve at least six powers
of the inverse mass parameter. as for in it is proportional to m 2n1; after the integration
the leading term is of the order m 22n. therefore the zeroth and the second order are given
by i1 and i2. a straightforward calculation carried out in the framework of dimensional
regularization yields

therefore the leading term for the one-loop correction to the eective action of the non-

the essential feature of this correction is that terms that would depend on the background

presence necessarily leads to terms which depend on supercovariant derivatives of .

4.2.2 solution of the eective equations of motion

now let us consider the eective action (4.36) corresponding to the model with classical
action (4.26). the eective equation of motion corresponding to this model have the form

we note that quantum corrections in this model do not depend on . the zeroth order
approximation for the supereld  is 0 = 0 (since w
 = 0 only at  = 0) (see (2.20)). the
rst order approximation (3.20) looks like

1 =

(4.38)

it follows from (3.20) that for this model the n-th order approximation n is of the order

this is a nal result for the one-loop corrected eective action of light superelds and applies
to a general choice of w1.

we note that the result (4.39) is consistent with the decoupling theorem. if we choose
1 = 2 (the minimal model), we can carry out the redenition of the

for example w1 = 2, w

the result is consistent with the decoupling theorem and coincides in form with the case that
corresponds to the minimal model discussed in section 3. however, we note again that since
parameters of the theory (elds, masses, couplings) are xed from string theory, they cannot
be redened. therefore the classical action is modied by one-loop corrections. the nal
result for the eective action of light superelds is given by (4.39).

5 quantum corrections to the eective action in gauge

theories

5.1 gauge invariant model of massive chiral superelds

for the sake of completeness we would like to address the decoupling eects in the n = 1
supersymmetric gauge theory with chiral superelds that interact with the corresponding
gauge superelds (i.e. chiral superelds that are charged under the gauge symmetry)1. to
simplify the consideration we choose the abelian u(1) gauge theory with the chiral superelds
charged under u(1). the simplest (minimal) model describing gauge invariant interactions
between massive and light chiral superelds, and the u(1) gauge supereld is of the form:

s = z d8z( 1e2gv 1 + 2e2gv 2 + egv ) +

64 z d6zw 2 + (z d6z(m12 + 12) + h.c.)

here v is a real scalar supereld, 1, 2,  are heavy chiral superelds, w = d2dv is a
supereld strength. the model is invariant under the following gauge transformations with

(5.2)

for the sake of concreteness we chose the specic u(1) charges for the chiral superelds
such that there is an allowed tri-linear interaction term between i and . for the sake
of simplicity we did not include self-interactions of the light elds in the chiral potential.
in addition, we did not include explicitly the terms of possible other light chiral superelds
which we chose not to interact with i and  superelds; these additional chiral superelds
however should be present, in order to cancel chiral anomalies.

the gauge-xing term is of the form

sgf =

(5.5)

the eective action can again be studied in the framework of the loop expansion. to carry
out the calculations we split all the superelds into a sum of background 1, 2, , v and
quantum 1q, 2q, q, v superelds by the rule

1  1 + 1q, 2  2 + 2q
   + q, v  v + v

(5.6)

as a result we arrive at the quadratic action of quantum superelds

sq = z d8zn 1

(5.7)

in the following we employ this action to determine the one-loop corrections.

the one-loop contribution in the eective action (1) is dened in the usual way (see [21]):

exp(i(1)[1, 2, , v ]) = z d1qd2qdqdv exp(isq[1q, 2q, q, v; 1, 2, , v ])

(5.8)

the low-energy leading terms in the eective action are the kahlerian eective potential
that depends only on 1, 2, , 1, 2, , v but not on their supercovariant derivatives, the
chiral eective potential that is a holomorphic function of chiral superelds 1, 2, , and the
eld depending eective gauge coupling f (1, 2, ) holomorphic function of superelds that
multiplies the term proportional to w 2. they completely specify the low-energy eective
action of n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory (see, e.g., [29]).

5.2 one-loop kahlerian potential in supersymmetric gauge theory

to study decoupling eects in the model (5.1) we determine the one-loop kahlerian eective
potential and consider the eective equations of motion for the heavy superelds. we carry
out calculation of one-loop quantum contribution to kahlerian eective potential on the base
of the expression (5.8) with quadratic action of quantum superelds (5.7). perturbative
approach for the action (5.7) can be developed by a following way. we consider

v[ + (

(5.9)

as a quadratic part which leads just to the propagators (5.4) and all other terms in (5.7) are
treated as vertices of interaction.

let us consider possible one-loop supergraphs. they can contain both < vv > and
<   >, < 1 1 >, < 2 2 >, < 12 > propagators. we will use landau gauge  = 0.
the propagator < vv > is proportional to projecting operator 1 =  d d2d
in this gauge,
and propagators <   >, < 1 1 >, < 2 2 > are proportional to projecting operator
0 = d2d2
16 (see f.e.(5.4)). the projecting operators 0 and 1 are orthogonal to each other
[20], as a result each supergraph containing propagators both of chiral superelds and of
gauge superelds has zero contribution (it is easy to see that analogous situation takes place
for supergraphs containing propagator < 12 > due to identity d20 = 0). therefore
there are no supergraphs containing both propagators of chiral and gauge superelds. as a
result, in landau gauge there can exist only two types of supergraphs: rst of them contains
propagators of chiral superelds only, second one contains propagators of gauge superelds

8

35

only. hence in order to calculate the one-loop kahlerian eective potential we can omit in
action (5.7) cross terms, i.e. those ones that include both the chiral and vector quantum
superelds because such terms will lead to supergraphs containing both propagators of chiral
and gauge superelds. as a result one can use the expression for the quadratic action

sq = z d8zn 1

it leads to the same supergraphs as (5.7). at the end of calculations

to study the one-loop contribution to kahlerian eective potential it is convenient to

introduce background superelds , 1, 2 and conjugated ones by the following way

 = egv /2,  = egv /2
1 = egv 1, 1 = 1egv
2 = egv 2, 2 = 2egv

(5.11)

the quantum superelds are redened by the same way. such redenitions represent them-
selves as a some sort of introduction of background covariantly chiral superelds [20]. we
note that background superelds , 1, 2 can be treated as constants. the quadratic action
of quantum superelds takes the form

is equal to 1. the contributions (1)

here  + 1 is absorbed into a redenition of . it is easy to see that this correction is gauge
invariant. we note that the quantum correction in the eective action of light superelds that
depend on the gauge coupling, arises. the expression (5.33) is quite analogous to the minimal
model of gauge neutral chiral superelds where the self-interaction of light chiral supereld is
absent. namely, the only contribution due to the gauge interactions (i.e. terms proportional
to the gauge coupling g) corresponds to the standard coleman-weinberg potential (the second
term, in the square brackets), which is due to the gauge interactions of the light elds, only.

the redenition    = z 1/2 where

z = 1 + 2 h

(5.34)

in turn yields the action corresponding to the in sector of chiral superelds only (i.e. with
the background gauge superelds put to zero) and can be written as

 = z d8z| |2 + o(

1
m 2 )

(5.35)

this result is again formally consistent with the decoupling theorem. however, since all
parameters (elds, masses, couplings) are determined from string theory it turns to be that
the classical action gets essential quantum correction given by (5.33).

5.3 chiral potential corrections

it turns
we now turn to the study of possible chiral corrections to the eective action.
out that unlike in the model with interacting gauge neutral chiral superelds, where the
rst set of quantum chiral correction arises at the two-loop level (see section 3), in n =
1 supersymmetric gauge theories the one-loop corrections to chiral eective potential are
possible. this situation is quite analogous to standard n = 1 super - yang - mills theory
with chiral matter [24]. however, we note that in the present theory chiral corrections to
eective action depend on the massive supereld 1.

in order to study chiral corrections to eective chiral potential action it is more suitable
to use a feynman gauge  = 1. in this gauge the propagator for the gauge supereld reads
as

< vv >=

1


8(z1  z2)

(5.36)

first, the chiral eective potential depends only on the chiral background superelds
, . second, we note that diagrams containing massive propagators cannot contribute to
the chiral eective potential (see section 3). therefore possible one-loop diagrams can contain
only vertices of the type v where  is a background supereld, and those of the type 12
where 1 is a background supereld. let the number of vertices v be n1, and the number
of 12 be n2. the number of quantum superelds  and  is equal to 2n2, and n1,
respectively. since the only green function for massless superelds is <   >, these two
numbers should be equal, 2n2 = n1. each vertex 12 corresponds to one factor d2 since
it is purely chiral, and each vertex v with  as the external eld corresponds to one factor

40

d2 (see e.g., [20]). then, a diagram that can contribute to the chiral eective potential has
to have a number of factors d2 that is by one larger than the number of factors d2 [27], i.e.
n1  n2 = 1. therefore we conclude that n1 = 2, n2 = 1. the only supergraph with such a
structure is given below:

(5.39)

however, since the heavy supereld  is at least of the rst order in the inverse mass (as
a solution of the eective equations of motion) this term is also of the rst order in the
inverse mass. nevertheless, this result demonstrates that quantum corrections to the chiral
eective potential can depend not only on massless supereld but also on massive ones. (it
was commonly believed that quantum corrections to the chiral eective potential can depend
only on massless superelds.)

5.4 strength depending contributions in the eective action

in this subsection, we are going to consider quantum corrections to the gauge function, i.e.
a holomorphic function that multiplies w 2 in the leading low-energy approximation to the

41

eective action. to simplify the consideration we use again the langau gauge  = 0; the
loops can contain only either propagators for chiral superelds or propagators for vector
superelds. however, since the external vector supereld can connect only to the vertex of
the form vi i (or v ) the possible supergraphs must necessarily contain propagators for the
chiral superelds and therefore at the one-loop level, only propagators for chiral superelds
contribute. (we also note that in principle it is possible to study corrections proportional to
w 2 in a general gauge.)

now, we turn to the study of possible supergraphs with two external gauge lines. first,
we note that the vertex g 2v2 can be associated either with the propagator < vv > or
with the external vector supereld line. however, as noted above, in the landau gauge the
loops of the form under consideration cannot contain propagators < vv >. therefore the
only contributing supergraph containing the vertices v2 2 is of the form

d2

recall that the dashed line denotes the propagator < 2 2 > (the same on as for < 1 1 >),
and the wavy line denotes the propagator < vv >. the contribution of the diagram has the

the euler constant  here is absorbed into a redenition of the normalization parameter .
as a result we see that this correction leads to a term proportional to log m 2
2 which evidently
increases logarithmically with m as m  .
now we turn to the study of corrections proportional to w 2 which do not contain propa-
gators of the eld 2. first of all, let us consider corrections at the zeroth order in the inverse
mass expansion. since the heavy superelds 1, 2 (after solving of the eective equations
of motion) correspond to expressions that are of the rst and/or higher orders in the inverse
mass expansion (see the discussions above), the corrections that are of the zeroth order in
1
m expansion therefore correspond to diagrams with massless external chiral superelds only.
such corrections are described by the supergraphs

let us now consider contributions that depend on external heavy chiral superelds. we
assume that the supergraph can contain n1 vertices of the form 12
q, n1 vertices of the form
1 2
q, n2 vertices of the form 1qq, and n2 vertices of the form  1q q. thus, the number
of external 1 is equal to n1, and the number of external  is equal to n1. we note that
there are no propagators of heavy superelds 2 in the supergraphs under consideration (in
the landau gauge), therefore the only possible supergraphs are <   > and < 1 1 >.
hence the number of quantum superelds  and , and correspondingly, the number of 1q
and 1q must be equal, and we arrive at the relations n2 = n2, 2n1 + n2 = 2n1 + n2. these
relations leads us to conclude that n1 = n1 and therefore contributions of supergraphs must
be proportional to (1 1)n1. since the solution of the eective equations of motion yields
the result that the heavy supereld 1 is at least of the second order in 1
m (see above) we
conclude that terms with a non-trivial dependence on the background eld 1 must be of
the fourth order in 1
m .

as a result, the one-loop corrected eective action in the gauge sector if of the form:

(1)[w ] =

1

64 z d6zw 2(1 + 9g2 h

162 log

m 2

2 ) + o(cid:16) 1
m 4(cid:17)

(5.49)

this expression contains terms logarithmically increasing with m and thus the gauge function
f can get signicant corrections due to the contributions of the heavy elds. note, however,
that these corrections can be reinterpreted as the standard one-loop threshold corrections due
to the contributions of the heavy elds. namely, these leading eects are due to the coupling
of the vector gauge elds to the heavy chiral superelds, and are therefore proportional to
the gauge coupling g. on the other hand a contribution due to the coupling  between light
and heavy chiral superelds is absent at this order. (it appears only at higher orders in 1
m
expansion.)

again it is straightforward to show that the obtained result is in compliance with the
decoupling theorem. we redene the vector supereld v (and consequently the supereld

44

strength w ) by the rule v = z 1/2

1 v where z1 is a nite renormalization constant

z1 = 1 + 9g2 h

162 log

m 2
2

then the expression (5.49) takes the form

(1)[w ] =

1

64 z d6zw 2 + o(cid:16) 1
m 2(cid:17)

(5.50)

(5.51)

which is again of the same form as the corresponding term in the classical action. on the
other hand the terms that include the interaction between the vector supereld and the chiral
ones should stay invariant under such a redenition of elds. therefore we must redene the
gauge coupling g by the rule g = z 1/2
g. after these redenitions the one-loop eective
action takes the form

1

(1) =

1

64 z d6z w 2 +z d8zeg v  + o(

1
m

)

(5.52)

as a result the one-loop corrected eective action is of the same form as the classical action of
light (massless) superelds , v, only, as expected by the decoupling theorem. however, since
values of elds and couplings are determined from string theory, they cannot be redened,
and the nal result for one-loop corrected eective action in the sector of gauge superelds is
thus given by (5.49) which allows us to conclude that the classical action in this sector gets
essential corrections.

6 summary

in this paper we presented a systematic analysis of the decoupling eects in n = 1 super-
symmetric theories with chiral superelds. we developed techniques to evaluate explicitly
the one-loop corrected actions that involve both the heavy and light chiral superelds for dif-
ferent types of classical kahlerian and chiral potentials. by a subsequent elimination of the
heavy chiral superelds by their equations of motion, via an iterative procedure, the result-
ing eective actions of light chiral superelds include the quantitative decoupling corrections
and the one-loop level. we considered dierent examples of theories describing dynamics of
interacting light (massless) and heavy superelds. for these theories the one-loop kahlerian
eective potential was calculated and subsequently the heavy superelds were expressed via
light ones up to a certain order in the inverse (heavy) mass parameters, thus resulting in an
explicit form of the eective action (up to a certain order in the inverse mass expansion) for
light superelds, only.

as a representative example we carried out a detailed analysis for the so-called mini-
mal model. this model contains two (gauge neutral) chiral superelds, one heavy and one
massless, while the classical kahlerian potential contains only the renormalizable (canonical)
terms and the classical chiral potential is renormalizable with the self-interaction term of the
light elds and an interaction term linear in the heavy eld. the results of these calculations

45

demonstrate that the leading order decoupling eects at the loop-level grow logarithmically
with the heavy mass scale. in addition, we also analysed the loop corrections to the chiral
potential, and found that at the two-loop level the corrections to the heavy elds do appear,
which are, however, suppressed in the eective action of light elds by inverse powers of the
heavy mass scales.

in the subsequent section we carried out the analysis of the non-minimal models with a
more general structure of the kahlerian and chiral potentials, that involve one light and one
massive eld. while the analysis of these models cannot be carried out explicitly for a general
choice of the classical kahlerian and chiral potential, we developed techniques to determine
the eective action as a series expansion in the inverse powers of the heavy mass parameter.
we have also addressed the decoupling eects for n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories with
heavy and light chiral elds charged under the gauge group. in particular, we analysed the
u(1)-abelian (minimal) model with charged heavy and light chiral superelds, a minimal
(gauge invariant) kaherian potential and a chiral potential with an interaction term linear in
a heavy eld. the leading corrections to the kahlerian potential are independent of the gauge
coupling, however higher order terms (both for the one-loop corrected kahlerian and chiral
potential) are proportional to the gauge coupling. in addition we also demonstrated that
the leading correction to the gauge function is proportional to the gauge coupling, which can
be reinterpreted as a standard threshold eect due to the heavy charged chiral superelds.
(note however that in the leading order the gauge function corrections do not depend on the
chiral coupling of the heavy chiral superelds to the light ones.)

while our specic results are, of course, in agreement with the decoupling theorem, the
actual quantitative form of the decoupling eects may have important physics implications.
as it was stressed in the introduction, in an eective eld theory (without reference to an
underlying fundamental theory) the couplings are free parameters, xed by (low-energy)
experiments, and thus the above decoupling eects can indeed be all absorbed into rescalings
of the eective light elds. however, within string theory the original couplings are calculable
at the string scale and the corrections due to decoupling can now have sizable calculable
predictions for the low energy couplings. the results of our calculations explicitly conrm
that in n = 1 supersymmetric theories the decoupling eects at loop-level are of order log m,
and in specic cases they can signicantly modify the low energy predictions of the eective
couplings.

in particular, within a class of perturbative string models with an anomalous u(1), after
the vacuum restabilization, there are in general renormalizable interactions between the light
and heavy elds, with the mass of order m  mstring  (1017) gev. thus, the above one-
loop decoupling eects can signicantly change the low energy predictions for the couplings
at low energies, e.g., the electro-weak scale (  1 tev). let us repeat the analysis for
an example, in a class of string models discussed in [10][18], where typical values of the
couplings, calculated at mstring, are  = g = ggauge. here ggauge  0.8 is the value of the
gauge coupling at at mstring. renormalization group equations then determine the values of
 and g couplings at low energies . however, due to the one-loop decoupling eects there
is now also an additional correction in the eective coupling g for the light elds; it is of the
order of ()2/(162) log m 2/2  0.26. (we used the typical values m  mstring  1017

46

gev,   1 tev and ()  0.8.) this specic example indicates that for a class of four-
dimensional string vacua the actual prediction for the tri-linear couplings at low energy could
be corrected by 10  50%.
these contributions are expected to be of the form (cf.[26]):

let us conclude with a remark about the leading contributions at higher loop levels.

||2 logn (||2
2 ).

when choosing a renormalization condition of the form 2 = const  m 2 (analogous to the
one used in section 3) the typical contribution of these terms would be of the type

||2 logn (||2
m 2 )

thus implying that the decoupling eects at the higher loop leading decoupling eects could
be just as signicant, and they would further modify low-energy predictions of the eective
theory of light elds.

can also be obtained via a diagram technique.

in this model. the propagators of the superelds have the standard form [20]

ground light supereld  and corresponds to the classical action (3.3). this propagator is
denoted by a bold line as

=

+

+. . .

(

)n+. . .

a summation of this chain allows one to show that the total propagator of light quantum
supereld depends on the background light supereld in the following way

< q(z1) q(z2) >= 

d2

(b.9)

the propagator for heavy supereld  is given by (b.1). then we can see that beside the
diagrams discussed above there are two other types of supergraphs. the rst one consists of
an arbitrary number of repeating chains of the form <   ><   >, i.e.

where double lines correspond to an external alternating  and  , and a bold one to
<   > propagators. a contribution from a supergraph consisting of n such chains, because
of (b.1), is of the form

kn =

1

n(cid:16)

2||2 d2d2

16(  g2||2)(  m 2)(cid:17)

n

(b.10)

the second type consists of an arbitrary number of repeating chains of the form

<   ><   ><   ><   ><   ><  ><  ><  > which can be written as

here a dashed-and-dotted line denotes <  > and a jagged line denotes <   >. the
external double line denote background supereld . a contribution of a diagram consisting
of n such chains is of the form

. . . .

ln =

1

n(cid:16) m 28||82 d2d2
16(  g2||2)4(  m 2)4(cid:17)

n

(b.11)

the total one-loop correction in the kahlerian eective potential is a sum of k (1)
(b.8), and all
0
the kn and ln contributions. after a summation with a subsequent fourier transformation
and an integration over momenta with a subsequent subtraction of the one-loop divergences
we arrive at the one-loop correction in the kahlerian eective potential (3.5).

appendix c

let us consider a calculation of the one-loop kahlerian eective potential for the case when
light superelds are pure background ones and heavy superelds are pure quantum ones.

the computation of the one-loop eective action reduces to the problem of evaluating the

operator

the initial conditions for these equations and analogous ones for a, b, c are a = b = c =
a = b = c = 0 at s = 0. hence one nds that b(s) = b (s) = 0. solutions of other
equations are of the form

a(s) = a(s) =

as a result we arrive at the expression (4.17) for the one-loop kahlerian eective potential.
