abstract

we construct the n = 1 supergravity analog of the green-schwarz
and heterotic superstring theories in 10d. we nd the so(8) theory
previously found by compactication of 10d on k3. we also nd
eleven g2  g2 theories, two with symmetric matter content. it is not
obvious how tenof the g2  g2 theories can be gotten from 10d.

ten-dimensional superstrings [1], [2], [3], [4] are one of the most important
discoveries of our time. they have led to fundamental advance in the way
we perceive the relationships between particle physics, condensed matter
physics, gravity and mathematics.

the zero slope limit of the green-schwarz s0(32) open string theory in
10d is an n = 1 supergravity theory, and is interesting in its own right.
the important observation [2] that the leading gauge anomaly[5] in so(n)
is proportional to (n  32) means only so(32) is possible. the development
of the green-schwarz mechanism restored consistency to the theory, but
only for s0(32) where in addition 496 gauge group generators (vector elds)
are required to cancel the perturbative gravitational anomaly. once the
so(32) open string theory and then the heterotic theory were established,
much progress was made by various methods of compactication, and by
investigating generalized solitons and instantons (p-branes, d-branes, etc.)
and other nonperturbative aspects including dualities in these and related
theories. by extending the theories to 11 and 12 dimensions in the so-called
m and f theories relations were discovered among the 10d theories.

recently d = 6, n = 1 theories have taken center stage [7]since much can
be learned from compactifying 10d theories to 6d on the k3 manifold or
related orbifolds. several new classes of theories with extended guage groups
[8][9][10]have emerged in 6d.

here our aims are rather modest in that we wish to examine the closest
6d n = 1 supergravity analog of the 10d open 0(32) and heterotic super-
strings. first we observe that the leading one-loop gauge anomaly in d = 6 is
proportional to n  8 for so(n) gauge groups. (likewise one can show that
the leading 2-loop[11] and 3-loop [12]perturbative gauge anomalies also have
factors of n  8.) the so(8) that cancels this anomaly has 28 generators,
and one might expect this fact to play a prominent role in the cancellation
of both the leading perturbative gravitational anomaly and the global grav-
itational anomaly. however, the situation here is apparently more subtle
than d = 10, n = 1 case, since the selection of the allowed irreducible rep-
resentations in 6d supergravity is more rich and including hypermultiplets
and tensor multiplets. before we move on to trying to construct the so(8)
supergravity, we observe that there is another rank for gauge group with 28
generators, namely g2  g2, and that both so(8) and g2  g2 have maxi-
mal subgroups o(4)  o(4). this is rather reminiscent of the o(16)  o(16)
maximal subgroups of o(32) and e8  e8. 1

let us now proceed with the construction of the anomaly-free so(8) n =
1 supergravity in 6d. perturbative anomaly cancelation in 6d is understood
by examining the box diagram with an even numbers of guage eld and
graviton legs and massless fermions in the loop. these anomalies are either
pure guage, pure gravitational or mixed. anomaly freedom requires the
leading pure anomalies to either vanish or cancel and the remaining anomalies
to cancel by the green-schwarz mechanism.

the most convenient way to classify the massless particle representations
in n = 1 6d supergravity is via their o(4)  su(2)  su(2) little group [9]
where the spectrum contains:

(3, 3) + 2(2, 3) + (1, 3) graviton
(3, 1) + 2(2, 1) + (1, 1) tensor multiplet

1also it may be worthy to note the curiosity that the number of generators in the
10d theory, i. e., 496, is a perfect number with deep number-theoretic signicance. the
sequence of perfect numbers is 1, 6, 28, 496, . . . while the signicance of 28 generators in
6d will remain obscure here, it is interesting to also guess that in 4d there may be an
s0(4) or equivalently su (2)  su (2) theory with 6 generators, and in 2d a related so(2)
theory.

2(2, 1) + 4(1, 1) hypermultiplet
as usual there is a single graviton supermultiplet but we can let nt , nv ,
and nh be the numbers of tensor, vector, and hypermultiplets. we restrict
ourselves to gauge group g either so(8) or g2  g2and so nv = dimg = 28.
the hypermultiplets are in some representation r of g, so nh = dimr. we
take nt = 1, as is expected from 10d superstring compactication, but note
that this restriction could be relaxed [19].

the total perturbative anomaly polynomial i6d [4][6][13] has contribu-
tions from gravitons, dilatons, guaginos, and matter fermions. this result
has been expressed in a form that meets our needs in [10]:

h is the number of hypermultiplets in the representation ri of the
guage group factor g. the last term in this equation is absent when g =
o(8), but for g=g2  g2 it survives with ni,i
h the number of hypermultiplets
in the representation (ri, ri) or g2  g2. the tr traces are in the adjoint
representation and the trri traces are taken in the ri representation. for
any guage group we can write all traces in terms the unindexed tr trace for in
the fundamental representation. for the case at hand we need the following
relations:

1. the leading gravitational anomaly must cancel directly, hence we de-

mand nh = 272.

2. the leading guage anomaly must also vanish or cancel directly. this
happens trivially for g2  g2 since g2 has no forth order casimir
invariant.

for so(8) the leading anomaly is zero for the adjoint representation,
so there is no guagino contribution but the vector and spinor irreps
all have nonvanishing forth order casimir and so the only way for the
leading guage anomaly to vanish in an so(8) theory with lowest level
matter hypermultiplets is to allow only guage group singlet hypermulti-
plets. hence we have a consistent so(8) theory with 272 singlet matter
hypermultiplets. this result agrees with the limiting case of enhanced
symmetry theories with guage group so(8 + n)  sp(n) with 24  n
units of instanton number embedded in so(32) [20]. these theories
have hypermultiplets in the 1
(1, 2n) representation
of so(8 + n)  sp(n) plus the antisymmetric representation of sp(n).
the total number of singlet hypermultiplets is 20 + 1
2 (n  24) (n  21)
plus one associated with the antisymmetric tensor eld of sp(n). if
we let n = 0 the guage group becomes so(8) and the number of sin-
glet hypermultiplets is precisely 272. this also agrees with the limit-
ing case of the innite sequence of models found by schwarz [9]where
g = so(8 + 2n)  sp(n) and the hypermultiplets are in the represen-
tation (2n + 8, 2n) + 272(1, 1). here

again for n = 0 we have g = so(8) with 272 singlet hypermultiplets.

and so the number of singlets is ns = 272720 = 132. it is interesting
to note that we can have either a symmetric matter content between
7 = 10, or an antisymmetric matter
g2 and g
content if n7 6= n
7. it is also possible to have a g2  g2 theory with
only 272 singlet hypermultiplets.

2 when we choose n7 = n

we have constructed theories with no perturbative anomalies, but for
them to be fully consistent theories we must go on to show that they con-
tain no non-perturbative anomalies. in 6d, the global gauge anomaly \cite
vanishes for all gauge groups where the 6th homotopy group vanishes. since
6 (so (8)) = 0 the so (8) theory is global gauge anomaly free. the g2  g

2) = z3  z3, but as braden has
theories, on the other hand, have 6 (g2  g
shown [17], all representations of g2 contribute only mod6 to the anomaly,
and hence the global gauge anomaly vanishes in these theories too.

finally, the global gravitational anomalies have been analyzed in 10d [4],
and 6d[4][13]. a straightforward analysis shows that both the so (8) and
g2  g

2 theories in 6d are global gravitational anomaly free.

it is obvious that the so (8) theory can be obtained from 10d by com-
pactication on k3 (see for example[20]). the g2  g
2 theories may be more
interesting. g2 is not a simply laced lattice, and if a corresponding string
theory was to exist, its direct construction would be non-standard. if the
g2  g
2 theories can be obtained by compactication, then the holonomy
group of k3 must be identied with the gauge group in a nontrivial way.

one could try the (f4  g2)  (f 
attempt to extend the su(2) holonomy of k3 from su(2) to f4, and then
identify it with the diagonal (f4)d = f4  f
