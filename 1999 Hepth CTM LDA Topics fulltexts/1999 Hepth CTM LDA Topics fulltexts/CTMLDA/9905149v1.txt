abstract

we show that the single-mode parafermionic type systems possess supersymmetry,
which is based on the symmetry of characteristic functions of the parafermions related
to the generalized deformed oscillator of daskaloyannis et al. the supersymmetry is
realized in both unbroken and spontaneously broken phases. as in the case of recently
observed parabosonic supersymmetry (hep-th/9903130), the form of the associated su-
peralgebra depends on the order of the parafermion and can be linear or nonlinear
in the hamiltonian. the list of supersymmetric parafermionic systems includes usual
parafermions, nite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator, q-deformed parafermionic oscil-
lator and parafermionic oscillator with internal z2 structure.

1 introduction

supersymmetric quantum mechanics [1, 2] is a (0 + 1)-dimensional model of supersymmetric
quantum eld theories. in the case of n = 1 supersymmetry it is formulated in terms of
one bosonic and one fermionic degrees of freedom. its bosonized version [3, 4] is described
by only one bosonic degree of freedom. however, the price which is necessary to pay for
such minimal realization of supersymmetry is the essentially nonlinear (nonlocal) structure
of the hamiltonian and supercharges. recently it has been shown [5] that the n = 1
supersymmetry can be realized, alternatively, by the single-mode parabosonic system given
by the hamiltonian of the simplest normal ordered, hn = a+a, or antinormal ordered,
ha = aa+, form. in both cases the hamiltonian is quadratic in parabosonic operators, but
the associated supercharges have essentially nonlinear structure in a. the anticommutator
of such supercharges is given by the polynomial of the hamiltonian, {q, q} = h(h), whose
degree is correlated with the order p of parastatistics dened by the relation aa+|0i = p|0i.
in the simplest case corresponding to p = 2, the usual linear superalgebra with {q, q} = h
is associated with the single-mode parabosonic system being in the phase of exact (hn) or
spontaneously broken (ha) supersymmetry.

for revealing the described supersymmetries, the r-deformed heisenberg algebra [6],

[a, a+] = 1 + r,

{r, a} = 0, r2 = 1,

(1.1)

has been used, which at the non-negative integer values of the deformation parameter,
 = p 1, p = 1, 2, . . . , is directly related to a paraboson of order p [7]. on the other hand, it
was established [6] that at the special negative values of the deformation parameter given by
the sequence  = (2k + 1), k = 1, 2, . . ., the parafermionic algebra with internal z2 struc-
ture is naturally associated with the algebra (1.1). therefore, this paraboson-parafermion
universality of the algebra (1.1) indicates that the supersymmetry can also be realized in the
single-mode nite-dimensional parafermionic type systems.

the present paper is devoted to investigation of supersymmetry in pure parafermionic
systems and is organized as follows. in section 2 we consider nite-dimensional representa-
tions of the generalized deformed oscillator of daskaloyannis et al [8, 9], and show that the
systems described by the simplest hamiltonians hn = f f and ha = f f  possess the un-
broken supersymmetry, whereas the hamiltonian hs = f f + f f  describes supersymmetric
systems in the phase of spontaneously broken supersymmetry. here the analysis is given in
general form not depending on the concrete structure of the parafermionic type oscillator,
and it is shown that in the cases of broken and unbroken supersymmetries the form of the as-
sociated superalgebra depends on the parity of the order p of the (generalized) parafermion.
in section 3 we consider particular examples of nite-dimensional supersymmetric systems
related to various deformation schemes of the single-mode oscillator algebra. this includes
the usual parafermions [7], the generalized deformed parafermions with internal z2 structure
[6], the nite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator [10, 11, 12] and the q-deformed parafermions
[13, 14]. section 4 is devoted to discussion and concluding remarks.

2 supersymmetry of generalized deformed oscillator

2.1 generalized deformed oscillator

the generalized deformed oscillator [8] is dened by the algebra generated by the operators
{1, f, f , n} satisfying the relations

[n, f ] = f,

[n, f ] = f ,

f f = f (n),

f f  = f (n + 1),

(2.1)

where n is the number operator and the structure function f (x) is an analytic function with
the properties f (0) = 0 and f (n) > 0, n = 1, . . .. as a consequence, the operators f , f 
obey the commutation and anticommutation relations

{f , f } = f (n + 1) + f (n),

[f, f ] = f (n + 1)  f (n).

(2.2)

the structure function f (x) is characteristic to the deformation scheme.

the generalized deformed oscillator algebra can naturally be represented on the fock
hn|mi = nm, n = 0, 1, . . . , if

space of eigenstates of the number operator n, n|ni = n|ni,
the vacuum state is dened as f |0i = 0. such eigenstates are given by

|ni =

1

qf (n)!

(f )n|0i, f (n)! 

n

y

k=1

f (k).

the operators f and f  are the annihilation and creation operators of this oscillator algebra,

f |ni = qf (n)|n  1i,

f |ni = qf (n + 1)|n + 1i.

when the characteristic function obeys the condition

f (p + 1) = 0,

(2.3)

(2.4)

the creation-annihilation operators satisfy the relations f p+1 = (f )p+1 = 0. this means that
the corresponding representation is (p + 1)-dimensional and we have a parafermionic type
system of order p. it is this case that will be treated in what follows.

2.2 unbroken supersymmetry

let us suppose that the structure function satises also the property

f (n) = f (p + 1  n).

(2.5)

then the parafermionic-like systems given by the quadratic hamiltonians hn = f f and
ha = f f  possess the degenerated spectra, whose typical form is shown on fig. 1.

the parafermions [7], the generalized deformed parafermions with internal z2 structure
[6], the nite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator [10, 11, 12] and the q-deformed parafermions
[13, 14] are given by the characteristic functions having the property (2.5). the form of
the degenerated spectra indicates that these systems may possess the supersymmetry of
two types. the supersymmetry corresponding to the case of even p is characterized by the

tonian hn = f f for the cases of a) odd p (p = 5) and b) even p (p = 6).

presence of one singlet state (|0i for hn and |pi for ha), whereas the case of odd p is specied
by the presence of two singlet states (|0i and |(p + 1)/2i for hn, and |pi and |(p  1)/2i for
ha). therefore, one can expect that dierent superalgebras can be associated with such
systems in the cases of the even and of the odd order generalized parafermions.

let us nd the corresponding supercharge operators and the form of superalgebras which
they form with the hamiltonian. we start with the case of even p. in the system given
by the hamiltonian hn = f f , there are p/2 pairs of the states {|ni,
|p + 1  ni} with
energy en = ep+1n = f (n), n = 1, . . . , p/2. the supercharges q and q have to transform
mutually the states in each supersymmetric doublet and annihilate the singlet state |0i. one
can specify them by the relations

q|0i = 0, q|p + 1  ni  |ni, q|ni = 0,

q|0i = 0, q|ni  |p + 1  ni, q|p + 1  ni = 0,

(2.6)

where n = 1, ..., p/2. these relations mean that the operator q transforms the rst half of
the states forming supersymmetric doublets into the second half states while the conjugate
operator q acts in the opposite direction. eqs. (2.6) and (2.5) lead to the relations

q2 = (q)2 = 0,

[q, hn] = [q, hn] = 0,

(2.7)

saying that the operators q and q are the mutually conjugate conserving nilpotent op-
erators, i.e. are the supercharges.
in correspondence with eqs. (2.6), (2.7), they can be
represented in the form

q =

p/2

n f p+12n,

(2.8)

where p p

n are the projectors, p p

leads to the usual n = 1 superalgebra given by eq. (2.7) and

{q, q} = hn.

(2.12)

(2.13)

the supercharges given by eqs. (2.8) and (2.12) can be represented in a more compact
form. for the purpose, let us introduce the z2-grading operator , 2 = 1, by which the
hamiltonian is classied as the even (bosonic) operator, [, h] = 0, and the supercharges
are classied as the odd (fermionic) operators, {, q} = {, q} = 0. it can be chosen in
the form

then the states |ni with n = 0, . . . , p
2 and n = p
2 , . . . , p have the parities +1 and 1,
respectively. on the other hand, the operators f and f  do not have denite parity (they
are not either even or odd operators). using the relation (2.11), one can represent the
supercharges in the form

also represent the supercharges as

with (n) = f (n).

now let us turn to the case of odd p, where the system described by the hamiltonian
hn = f f = f (n) is characterized by the presence of two singlet (unpaired) states |0i and
| p+1

we get the relation

 hn(cid:17) .

taking into account the symmetry relation (2.5), we get the solution to eq. (2.19):

(2.22)

with its help we represent the supercharges (2.18) in the form (2.15), where now the pro-
jectors p are dened in terms of grading operator (2.22), and c p(n) is given by eq. (2.21)
with f (n) replaced by f (n). in terms of the operators (2.16) the supercharges can also be
given in the form (2.17) with (n) = f (n)(n), where (n) is given by eq. (2.19) with
f (n) substituted for f (n).

therefore, for odd p the system hn = f f can be characterized by the nonlinear su-
peralgebra (2.7), (2.20), and we conclude that in general case of the even and odd order
generalized parafermions the anticommutator of supercharges is given by the polynomial of
the hamiltonian whose order coincides with the number of singlet states. this resembles the
property of the supersymmetry in pure parabosonic systems with normal ordered hamilto-
nian where the order of the polynomial appearing in the anticommutator of supercharges

in the cases of a) odd p (p = 5) and b) even p (p = 6).

coincides with the number of singlet states in the system, which, in turn, is dened by the
order of the paraboson.

however, here, unlike the parabosonic case, the systems given by hn and ha reveal, in
fact, the same supersymmetry. indeed, due to the symmetry relation (2.5), the spectrum
of the hamiltonian ha = f f  = f (n + 1) is a mirror reection of the spectrum of the
hamiltonian hn = f f = f (n) with respect to the middle point of the interval [0, p]. as
a consequence, all the analysis and formulas for the supersymmetric parafermionic systems
described by ha may be immediately obtained from those given above for the systems with
hn via the formal substitutions f  f , f   f, n  p  n, and we do not expose them
explicitly.

2.3 spontaneously broken supersymmetry

let us consider the parafermionic system given by the quadratic hamiltonian

hs = f f + f f .

(2.23)

when the associated characteristic function satises the symmetry relation (2.5), the spec-
trum of (2.23) is also supersymmetric (see fig. 2). however, this time the spectrum has
no energy zero level, but,
instead, the lowest energy level is positive and degenerated:
e0 = ep = f (1) > 0. therefore, the system described by the hamiltonian (2.23) has
the features of the system realizing spontaneously broken supersymmetry. here, as for the
supersymmetric systems given by hn and ha, two cases has to be distinguished: with odd
ps all the states are paired in supersymmetric doublets, whereas the case of even ps is
characterized by the presence of one singlet state | p

2i.

the supercharge for the system (2.23) can be realized in the form

q =

[ p+1

where [.] means the integer part and the coecients c p

with (n) = en/f ( p+1

the supercharge q and its conjugate obey the relations

introducing the grading operator

(2.26)

one can represent the supercharges in the form

q = c p(n)f 2n pp, q = (f )p2n c p(n)p+,

where c p(n) is obtained from eq. (2.24) with n substituted for n. the operators (2.16)
give the alternative representation

q = q(n) f 2n pp, q = q(n)( f )p2n p+,

where (n) = f (n) + f (n + 1) = hs for odd p and (n) = e p

 hs for even p.

2

thus, here in both cases of even and odd ps the anticommutator of supercharges is linear
in hamiltonian hs, but its form is dierent due to dierent structure of the corresponding
spectra.

3 finite-dimensional supersymmetric systems

in this section we consider the particular examples of supersymmetric nite-dimensional
systems related to various deformation schemes of the oscillator algebra, for which the results
of the previous section can be applied.

3.1 parafermionic oscillator

the algebra of the usual parafermions [7] is dened by the relations

{f, f } = p + 2pn  2n 2,

[f, f ] = p  2n,

from which the trilinear parafermionic relations, [[f , f ], f ] = 2f , [[f , f ], f ] = 2f , and
the vacuum relation f f |0i = p|0i can be immediately obtained. the comparison with eq.
(2.2) gives the parafermionic structure function:

f (n) = n(p + 1  n).

(3.1)

it possesses the symmetry property (2.5) which leads to the discussed supersymmetries.

8

3.2 finite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator

the q-deformed oscillator is dened by the relation [10, 11, 12]

aa  q1aa = qn .

the structure function of this system is

f (n) = fq(n) =

qn  qn
q  q1 .

(3.2)

when q is a primitive root of unity of the even order, q2(p+1) = 1, i.e. q = ei 
p+1 , the
system has the (p + 1)-dimensional fock type representation, characterized by the relations
ap+1 = (a)p+1 = 0. in this case the structure function acquires the form

f (n) =

sin n
p+1
sin 
p+1

,

(3.3)

and obeys the symmetry condition (2.5).

3.3 the q-deformed parafermionic oscillator

the q-deformed parafermionic algebra [13, 14] is dened by the structure function

f (n) = fq(n)fq(p + 1  n),

where fq(n) is given by eq. (3.2). this structure function obeys the symmetry relation
(2.5). at q = ei 
p+1 we have the (p+1)-dimensional representation with the structure function
which, due to eq. (2.5), is reduced to the square of the structure function (3.3):

f (n) =

sin2 n
p+1
sin2 
p+1

.

(3.4)

all three systems (3.1), (3.3) and (3.4) possess the spectra corresponding to the exact
(unbroken) and spontaneously broken supersymmetry of the type shown on figs. 1 and 2.
note that in this context the fermion system (p = 1, f (n) = n(2  n)) with hamiltonian
hs = {f , f } = 1 realizes the simplest case of spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

3.4 parafermionic oscillator with internal z2 structure

the even order parafermionic oscillator with internal z2 structure is associated with the
r-deformed heisenberg algebra which, in turn, is related to parabosons [6]. the r-deformed
heisenberg algebra is generated by the operators {1, a, r} satisfying the (anti)commutation
relations (1.1), where   r is a deformation parameter and r is the reection operator.
the structure function of this algebra is

f (n) = n + 

1
2

(1  (1)n ) = n +  sin2 n
2

.

(3.5)

9

on the half-line  > 1, it is positive denite, f (n) > 0 for n = 1, 2, . . ., that means that the
algebra (1.1) with  > 1 has innite-dimensional unitary representations. when  = p  1,
p = 1, 2, . . ., they are the representations of the parabosonic oscillator system of the order
p. in the case of odd s,  = 2k + 1, k = 0, . . ., the structure function (3.5) satises the
relation f (2n + 1) = f (2n +  + 1) underlying the supersymmetries of the pure parabosonic
systems given by the hamiltonians hn = a+a = f (n) and ha = aa+ = f (n + 1) [5].

though the algebra (1.1) emerges from generalizing the bosonic harmonic oscillator sys-
tem [7], it has also the nite-dimensional representations of the parafermionic nature [6].
indeed, at the special values of the deformations parameter,  =  (p + 1), p = 2, 4, 6, ...
the structure function (3.5) satises the relation f (p + 1) = 0, which signals on existence
of (p + 1)-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra (1.1), in which the rela-
tions (a)p+1 = 0 are valid. however, in this case the structure function f (n) is not
positive-denite, and the corresponding nite-dimensional representations are not unitary.
in such representations the creation-annihilation operators a are mutually conjugate with
respect to the indenite scalar product. on the other hand, with respect to the usual pos-
itive denite scalar product they are related as (a+) = ar [6]. therefore, dening new
creation-annihilation operators f = ar, f  = a+, we arrive at the following parafermionic
type algebra of the even order:

{f, f } = p + 1  r,

f p+1 = (f )p+1 = 0,

{r, f } = {r, f } = 0,

p = 2k.

(3.6)

due to the presence of the reection operator r = (1)n , the algebra has the natural
internal z2 structure. the structure function of this parafermionic type system is

f (n) = n(1)n + (p + 1) sin2 n
2

.

(3.7)

the property (2.5) is valid for the function (3.7). since this nite-dimensional oscillator with
internal z2 structure has the parafermionic type algebra of the even order, the corresponding
unbroken supersymmetry (for hn and ha) is characterized by the presence of only one singlet
state. in the simplest case p = 2 the spectrum en = (0, 2, 2) of hn has a form of the type
shown on fig. 1b. for p = 2k, k > 1, the spectrum of hn has a non-typical x-like form,
being a superposition of the increasing and decreasing spectra of the subspaces of even and
odd states, e2l = 2l, l = 0, ..., k, and e2l+1 = 2(k  l), l = 0, ..., k  1.

on the other hand, due to eq. (3.6), here the hamiltonian hs = {f +, f } has a two-level
degenerated spectrum for all p = 2k. therefore, the present parafermionic system has a
spectrum of spontaneously broken n = 1 supersymmetry only in the simplest case p = 2,
whereas the cases p = 4, 6, . . . , correspond to spontaneously broken extended supersymmetry.

4 discussion and outlook

we have shown that the single-mode parafermionic type systems possess supersymmetry. it
is based on the symmetry relation f (n) = f (p + 1  n) of the characteristic function of the
known generalized parafermions related to the deformed oscillator (2.1) of daskaloyannis
et al [8, 9]. the simplest quadratic hamiltonians hn = f f = f (n) and ha = f f  =
f (n + 1) describe the systems with unbroken supersymmetry specied by the presence

10

of one zero energy ground state in the spectrum, while the hamiltonian hs = f f + f f 
represents the system in the phase of spontaneously broken supersymmetry, characterized by
the doublet of positive energy ground states. besides, the form of supersymmetry depends
on whether the order p of the parafermion is even or odd. in the case of the systems with
exact supersymmetry for even p there is only one singlet state (of zero energy) in the systems
spectrum (|0i for hn and |pi for ha) and the anticommutator of the supercharges is equal
to the hamiltonian, i.e. we have here the usual superalgebra (2.7), (2.13) of the n = 1
supersymmetry. in the case of odd p, the systems with unbroken supersymmetry possess
another singlet state with positive energy, | p+1
2 i for ha, in addition to the zero
energy ground state. as a consequence, for odd ps the anticommutator of the supercharges is
given by the polynomial quadratic in the hamiltonian (see eq. (2.20)). the supersymmetries
of the systems given by the normal ordered hamiltonian hn and by the antinormal ordered
hamiltonian ha turn out to be the same due to the relation f (n) = f (p + 1  n) underlying
supersymmetry. in the case of spontaneously broken supersymmetry, the case of odd p is
characterized by the presence of only supersymmetric doublets in the spectrum, whereas the
spectra of parafermionic systems of even order p contain one singlet state | p
2i with positive
energy.
in both cases the superalgebra is linear in hs, but its concrete form is dierent
(see eq. (2.25)). as in the case of parabosonic supersymmetry, a nonlinear nature of the
described supersymmetry of parafermionic systems can be revealed in general case if to

we have seen that in the case of the hamiltonian hs, the parafermionic oscillator system
with internal z2 structure is dierent from other systems: here only p = 2 corresponds to
spontaneously broken n = 1 supersymmetry, while the cases p = 4, 6, . . . give spontaneously
broken extended supersymmetry. the specic nature of the structure function f (n) can
reveal itself in a particular way in other cases too. for example, with usual parafermions
(3.1) one can realize the specic supersymmetries generalizing those discussed here. such
generalized supersymmetries can be found in the systems given by the hamiltonian

hk = {f , f } + k[f , f ] + p(|k|  1),

k  z,

p  |k| + 1.

(4.1)

at k = 1, 0, 1, the hamiltonian hk is reduced to 2ha, hs  p and 2hn, respectively, and
for k 6= 0 it has the spectra which contain |k| (|k|  1) positive energy singlet states in
addition to zero energy ground state when p  k is even (odd). it is also possible to con-
struct analogous generalized supersymmetric hamiltonian for the case of nite-dimensional
q-deformed oscillator (3.2). for k > 0 the corresponding supercharges associated with (4.1)
can be realized in the form similar to (2.17),

q = q(n) f 2n pkp, q = q(n)( f)p+k2n p+,

with (n) = h  h(hk) q|k|1
m=0 (hkem), where em is the energy of the state |mi, h(hk) = 1
. the anticommutator
when p k is odd, h(hk) = emax hk for even p k and emax = e p+k
of supercharges is given here by {q, q} = h, i.e.
it is a polynomial in hk, whose order
coincides with the number of singlet states. the case k < 0 is obtained via the formal change
f   f , f  f , m  p  m.

the observed supersymmetries of parafermionic systems can be used for construction
of new types of parasupersymmetry [15]. indeed, in the simplest case of the hamiltonian
hps = bb + h, where b, b are the bosonic creation-annihilation operators and h is the
hamiltonian hn, ha or hs of the usual parafermions (3.1), we get the system with para-
in the lower part the spectrum is dierent from that of the
supersymmetric spectrum.
rubakov-spiridonov parasupersymmetric system hpsusy = bb + 1
2([f , f ] + p) [16]. for the
same purpose, one can use the appropriate linear combination of one of the supersymmetric
parabosonic hamiltonians with one of the supersymmetric parafermionic hamiltonians.

we have treated the parafermionic systems given by the hamiltonians of the simplest
quadratic form. however, it is clear that the hamiltonians of the form h = f (h) with
arbitrary function f of h = hn, ha, hs also possess the supersymmetric spectra. the same
is true for the analogous generalization of the parabosonic systems. therefore, the observed
supersymmetries of the single-mode parabosonic and parafermionic systems survive under
generalization to the case of the self-interacting systems.
it seems that generalizing the
present single-mode constructions to the many-modes oscillator systems, one could arrive at
the physically interesting supersymmetric quantum eld systems, formulated, e.g., in terms
of only one parabosonic or parafermionic eld.
