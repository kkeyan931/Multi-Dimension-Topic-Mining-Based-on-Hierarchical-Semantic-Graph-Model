introduction

the celebrated ads/cft correspondence relates eld theories on anti-de sitter (ads) space with
conformal eld theories (cfts) living on the ads horizon. the main prediction of this duality is
that cft correlation functions of conformal operators can be calculated by evaluating the ads
action on-shell as a functional of prescribed boundary values.

for example, using a scalar eld theory on ads space, cft correlators of conformal elds of
scaling dimensions   d/2 have been calculated [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and references therein]. until
recently, no prescription was known to include operators with scaling dimension , d/2  1 <  <
d/2. here, d/2  1 is the unitary bound on the conformal dimension of scalar operators. recently,
klebanov and witten [7] proposed a method to do just that. they used the fact that a scalar
eld on ads space can obey two types of boundary conditions [8]. the regular one, which can
always be imposed, leads to the cft correlators with   d/2, whereas the irregular one would
lead to d/2  1 <   d/2. they realized that the respective boundary elds are conjugate to
each other and proposed to use a legendre transform of the action, expressed as a functional of the
irregular boundary value, as the generating functional. they also demonstrated the correctness of
this proposal for cft two point functions.

in this article, we would like to expand on their proposal and demonstrate its correctness to all
orders in perturbation theory. a second result of our analysi is that a dierent greens function
must be used for internal lines in second or higher order graphs.

the outline of the article shall be as follows.

in the remainder of this section motivating
arguments about the origin of the irregular boundary conditions will be given.
in section 2 we
will for completeness repeat the formalism using regular boundary conditions. then, in section 3
klebanov and wittens proposal to include irregular boundary conditions shall be analyzed and
shown to be correct to any order in perturbation theory.

to start, consider an interacting scalar eld, whose action is given by

i =

1

2z

dx (cid:0)dd + m22(cid:1) + iint,

(1)

where iint denotes the interaction terms and dx = dd+1xpg(x) is the invariant volume integral

measure. the equation of motion following from the action (1) is given by

where1

(cid:0)dd  m2(cid:1) (x) = b(x),

b(x) =

iint
(x)

.

using as ads representation the conventional upper half space x  rd, x0 > 0 with the metric

ds2 = (x0)2dxdx,

the solution to equation (2) can be written in the form

(x) =z ddy (cid:20)

x0

(x  y)2(cid:21)

d

2 

f(y) +z

dy g(x, y)b(y),

1the functional variation is done covariantly, cf. [9].

(2)

(3)

(4)

where  =pd2/4 + m2 and g(x, y) is a standard greens function satisfying

(cid:0)dd  m2(cid:1) g(x, y) =

(x  y)

x

.

the free eld solution with the lower sign exists classically for  < d/2, but the unitary bound
restricts it further to  < 1 [8]. the functions f and f+ are called regular and irregular boundary
values and are conformal elds of scaling dimensions d/2   and d/2 + , respectively.
in the ads/cft correspondence the elds obeying regular boundary conditions give rise to cft
correlation functions of operators with conformal dimensions  restricted by   d/2. hence, the
use of irregular boundary conditions enables one to obtain correlation functions for operators with
scaling dimensions d/2  1 <  < d/2.

2 regular boundary conditions

let us start by rewriting the expression (4) as

(x) = (0)(x) +z

dx g(x, y)b(y),

where the greens function g(x) is given by [10, 3]

where f is the hypergeometric function,

g(x, y) = (x0y0)

(y denotes the vector (y0, y)), and

c =

(d/2 + )
d/2(1 + )

.

moreover, the free eld solution (0) shall be written as

(0)(x) =z ddy k(x, y)(0)

 (y) =z ddy k(x, y)(0)

+ (y).

the bulk-boundary propagators occuring in equation (10) are given by

k(x, y) = c(cid:20)

x0

(x  y)2(cid:21)

d

,

where c is given by equation (9), and their fourier transforms read

k(x, k) = 2

equations (12) and (10) imply that the boundary functions (0)

+ and (0)

 are related by

(0)
+ (k) = 

(1 + )(cid:18) k
(1  )

2(cid:19)2

(0)
 (k).

(13)

obviously, the free eld (0) can be written as a sum of two series, whose leading powers are
, respectively. thus, one nds by direct comparison with equations (10) and (12)

and xd/2+

xd/2

that the small x0 behaviour of (0) is

0

(0)(x)

x00

where subleading terms have been dropped. moreover, the greens function (8) goes like

g(x, y)

0 k(x, y).

(14)

(15)

hence, the interaction contributes only to the + part of the asymptotic boundary behaviour, i.e.
one can write

(x)

where

(16)

(17)

(18)

identical relations hold for the fourier transformed expressions.

now consider the on-shell action, treated as a functional of the regular boundary values .

integrating equation (1) by parts yields

i =

1

2z ddx xd

0 n 

1

2z

dx (x)b(x) + iint.

the rst term must be regularized, which is done by writing

d

where the ellipses indicate contributions from subleading terms and other terms which vanish for
x0 = 0. the rst term in the last line is cancelled by a covariant counterterm. hence, the
renormalized on-shell action is

i[] = z

= i (0)[]

2z

dx (x)b(x) + iint

dx dy b(x)g(x, y)b(y) + iint,

(19)

where equations (18), (17), (13), (6) and (10) have been used. the term i (0) in equation (19) is
given by

i (0)[] = 

(1  )
(1 + )z

= 2cz ddx ddy

ddk

(2)d (cid:18) k

2(cid:19)2
(x)(y)
|x  y|d+2

(k)(k)

(20)

and thus yields the correct two point function of scalar operators of conformal dimension  =
d/2 + , if one uses the ads/cft correspondence formula

ei[] =(cid:28)exp(cid:20)z ddxo(x)(x)(cid:21)(cid:29) .

(21)

the other two terms have to be expressed as a perturbative series in terms of (0). however, by
virtue of equations (10) and (17) this naturally yields a perturbative series in terms of the boundary
function .

irregular boundary conditions

the treatment of irregular boundary conditions follows an idea by klebanov and witten [7]. con-
sider the expression

i[]

= 2

(1 + )(cid:18) k

(k) +z

dx b(x)

(x)
(k)

2iint

(x)(z)

g(x, y)b(y)

(z)
(k)

.

using equation (13) and the formula

(x)
(k)

= k(x,k) +z

dy dz g(x, y)

2iint

(y)(z)

(z)
(k)

,

one nds

i[]
(k)

= 2(0)

+ (k) +z

dxk(x,k)b(x) = 2+(k),

or, after an inverse fourier transformation,

i[]
(x)

= 2+(x)

(22)

this expression holds to any order in perturbation theory. this fact was obtained in [7] using graph
arguments. furthermore, it shows rst that + can be regarded as the conjugate eld of  and
secondly that the functional

j[, +] = i[] + 2z ddx (x)+(x)

(23)

has a minimum with respect to a variation of .

klebanov and wittens idea [7] is to formulate the ads/cft correspondence by the formula

ej[+] =(cid:28)exp(cid:20)z ddxo(x)+(x)(cid:21)(cid:29) .

(24)

here, the functional j[+] is a legendre transform of the action i, i.e. it is the minimum value of
the expression (23), expressed in terms of +.

in the following klebanov and wittens result about the correctness of the two point function
[7] shall be conrmed and interactions included. the minimum of j is easiest found from equations
(19) and (23), giving

dx (x)b(x) + iint

+(k)+(k)

dx (x)b(x) + iint

dx dy b(x)g(x, y)b(y)

(25)

here equations (17), (13), (18), (12) and (6) have been used. the rst term in equation (25) can
be inversely fourier transformed, which yields

j (0) = 2cz ddx ddy

+(x)+(y)

|x  y|d2 .

(26)

according to the correspondence formula (24), this yields the correct two point function.

then, the second and fourth term in equation (25) can be combined by dening the greens

function

g(x, y) = g(x, y) +

1

2z ddz k(x, z)k(y, z).

(27)

this modied greens function g also satises equation (5), because the second term in equation
(27) does not contribute to the discontinuity. moreover, using equations (7) and (12) one nds

g(x, y) = (x0y0)

for x0 > y0,#

(2)d eik(xy)(k(ky0)i(kx0)

k(kx0)i(ky0)

for x0 < y0,
for x0 > y0,

which diers from equation (7) only by interchanging  and . hence, the result (8) can be taken
over, yielding

g(x, y) = 

c

( d

2 ) f (cid:0)d/2, d/2  ; 1  ; 2(cid:1) .

thus, inserting equation (27) into equation (25) yields

j[+] = j (0)[+]

2z

dx dy b(x) g(x, y)b(y) + iint.

moreover, one can see from equation (28) that for small x0 g behaves as

g(x, y)

x00

0 k(x, y).

hence, writing

(x) =z ddy k(x, y)+(y) +z

dy g(x, y)b(y),

(29)

(30)

(31)

the interaction contributes only to . this in turn means that, expressing iint and b as a
perturbative series and using equation (31), the functional j is naturally expressed in terms of
the irregular boundary value +. moreover, it has the expected form, in that it is obtained from
equation (19) by replacing  with  and  with +. an important point is that the greens
function g must be used for the calculation of internal lines.

finally, by a calculation similar to that of the derivation of equation (22) one nds

j[+]
+(x)

= 2(x).

(32)

this is a nal conrmation of the fact that the elds  and + are conjugate to each other.

in conlusion, we have expanded on klebanov and wittens recent idea for formulating the
ads/cft correspondence using irregular boundary conditions, showing it to give the expected
answers to any order in perturbation theory.
