abstract

various uid mechanical systems, governed by nonlinear dierential
equations, enjoy a hidden, higher-dimensional dynamical poincare
symmetry, which arises owing to their descent from a nambu-goto
action. also, for the same reason, there are equivalence transforma-
tions between dierent models. these interconnections are discussed
in this lecture, and are summarized in fig. 3 below.

having attended a few years ago the dedication of the bogolyubov institute
for theoretical physics, i am happy to be here again to commemorate the
90th anniversary of this emminent kievan mathematician/physicist. these
days, fueled by the string program, there is a vigorous interchange between
mathematics and physics, which bogolyubov would have been happy to wit-
ness. his activities encompassed eld theory, nonlinear systems, and kinetic
theory. just these subjects have become linked in my work, which i shall
describe in this lecture, dedicated to his memory.

i shall speak about several nonlinear equations of mathematical physics
in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which possess remarkable hidden symmetries
and unexpected constants of motion that allow construction of solutions, even
complete integration. moreover, the equations enjoy relationships with each
other that provide mappings of one onto another. in the language currently

this work is supported in part by funds provided by the u.s. department of energy

in use, there are dualities that relate completely dierent models. finally,
i shall describe how all these properties derive from an ur-formulation in
terms of extended objects  d-branes  in a higher dimension. the nonlinear
equations that i shall discuss are pre-existing and well known  they are
not constructed to illustrate the theory. the observations i make about
them are mostly new, though some results in low spatial dimensionality were
known previously. the work i describe was performed in collaboration with
bazeia [1] and polychronakos [2]; it is based on initial observations in this
area by bordermann and hoppe [3], as well as by jevicki [4].

1 nonrelativistic model

the rst equation that i shall consider describes nonrelativistic uid motion
in d-spatial dimensions, (d, 1) space-time. the matter density of the uid
is (t, r); its local velocity is v(t, r) and the current j(t, r) = v(t, r)(t, r) is
linked to the density by a continuity equation

 +   (v) = 0

(1)

(over-dot denotes dierentiation with respect to time.) the velocity satises
the euler equation, which relates the material time derivative of v to a force
(per unit volume), that is, to the gradient of the pressure p divided by 

v + v  v = f = 

1


p

(2)

for the nonrelativistic application, i shall be interested in a very special
force-law f:
its properties are, rst, it arises from a pressure p that is a
function only of  (this corresponds to isentropic ow); second, p is of the
polytropic form (p  power of ), and nally, third, the specic power law
is the inverse power; that is,

p () = 2/m

(3)

this is called the chaplygin gas and corresponds to a sound speedq2/m /
(hence we take   0) and enthalpy /m2 (m is the mass) [5].

the euler equation for the chaplygin gas reads

v + v  v =

m

it is consistent to look for solutions without vorticity (  v = 0), so we
write

v = /m

(5)

and replace (4) by bernoullis equation for the velocity potential , with a
source term given by the enthalpy.

(6)

the gradient of (6) reproduces (4).

in summary, we are studying the irrotational and isentropic motion of

the chaplygin gas.

eqs. (1) and (6) possess an action formulation with a rst-order (in time)

lagrangian.

and the canonical 1-form

leads to the poisson bracket

{(t, r), (t, r)} = (r  r)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

it is straightforwardly veried that eqs. (1) and (6) are a hamiltonian system
with the above bracket.

this model being nonrelativistic possesses the appropriate nonrelativistic
symmetry, namely, galileo invariance, and as a consequence of noethers the-
orem, there are constants of motion, which generate via bracketing innites-
imal galileo transformations. for future reference, i record these. time
translation, space translation, and rotation act on the coordinates (t, r) in
the obvious fashion and the transformed elds (, ) are evaluated on the

4

r. jackiw

transformed coordinates. the corresponding constants of motion are energy
e, momentum p, and angular momentum lij, given by the formulas

energy: e = h = z dr h
(energy density: h = ()2/2m + /)
momentum: p = z dr p

(momentum density: p = )

angular momentum:

lij = z dr(rip j  rjp i)

(11)

(12)

(13)

additionally there are the galileo boosts, which boost the spatial coordinate
by a velocity u

r  r  r  tu

while the density eld transforms simply

(t, r)  u(t, r) = (t, r)

the velocity potential undergoes an ane transformation,

(t, r)  u(t, r)  (t, r) + m(u  r  u2t/2)

(14)

(15)

(16)

which has the consequence that the velocity acquires (as expected) a boost

v(t, r)  vu(t, r) = v(t, r) + u

the associated constant of motion is the boost generator

boost generator: b = tp  mz dr r

(17)

(18)

also matter is conserved, as a consequence of invariance against a shift of 
by constant

(21)

one can verify that the action in r = r dt ln r is invariant against all

these transformations and consequently a transformation of a solution to the
equations of motions (1) and (6) is again a solution. the generators, which
can be obtained from the lagrangian (7) by noethers theorem, are all time-
independent, as can be veried by dierentiating them with respect to time,
and evaluating ( , ) from the equations of motion (1) and (6).

note there is a total of 1

2 (d + 1)(d + 2) + 1 generators, the correct number
for the (centrally extended) galileo group, where the extension 1-cocycle and
2-cocycle are responsible for the inhomogeneous term in (16) and lead to the
generator n of (21).

the remarkable fact about the chaplygin gas is that (in any number of
dimensions) it possesses further symmetries. first of all one can rescale time

t  t = et

the elds undergo an additional and opposite rescaling

(t, r)  (t, r) = e(t, r)
(t, r)  (t, r) = e(t, r)

the time-independent generator reads

d = th z dr

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

furthermore, a peculiar eld-dependent dieomorphism, which mixes inde-
pendent variables (t, r) and dependent elds (, ) also leaves the action
invariant. the transformation is parameterized by a d-component vector .
on coordinates this acts as
t  t = t +   r + 1
r  r = r + (t, r)/m

2 2(t, r)/m

(26)

(27)

fields transform according to

(t, r)  (t, r) = (t, r)
(t, r)  (t, r) = (t, r)

the vectorial, d-component generator is

g = z dr{rh  p/m}

(30)

(31)

just as with the conventional transformations/symmetries, the above trans-
formations leave the action invariant, and thus take solutions into new so-
lutions; the additional generators (d, g), d + 1 in number, are gotten by
noethers theorem and are time-independent by virtue of the equations of
motion.

using the canonical commutator (10) and the explicit formulas for the
generators, one may compute their lie algebra. as is expected, the 1
2 (d +
1)(d + 2) + 1 galileo generators (11)(13), (18) and (21), close on the (ex-
tended) galileo algebra,
in (d, 1) space-time. supplementing these with
the (d + 1) additional generators (25) and (31) one arrives at a total of
1
2(d + 2)(d + 3) generators, and their algebra closes on the poincare group
in one dimension higher, namely, (d + 1, 1) space-time. moreover, one es-
tablishes that the quantities (t, , r) transform as light-cone components of
a (d + 2) lorentz vector, with t acting as the + component, and  as the 
component [6].
thus we conclude that the nonrelativistic, galileo invariant chaplygin
gas in (d, 1) space-time possesses a hidden dynamical poincare symmetry
appropriate to (d + 1, 1) space-time, which is realized nonlinearly with eld-
dependent dieomorphisms.

using symmetry one can generate new solutions from old ones. of course
when the transformations are of the familiar galileo form, the new so-
lutions bear an obvious relation to the old ones; they are time or space
translated, space rotated or boosted, or -shifted. however, when the trans-
formations belong to the hidden symmetry, the new solutions take a new and
unexpected form.

for example, when d > 1, a simple solution to (1) and (6) is

[(t) is the step function t/|t|.] the (, ) proles in (32) are invariant against
the time-rescaling transformation (22)(24), but the eld-dependent dieo-
morphism (26)(29) alters the solution drastically. the analytic expression
for the transformed prole is uninformative, a plot conveys the situation
more clearly. in figs. 1 and 2, the 2-dimensional solutions are plotted: fig. 1
presents  of (32); in fig. 2 the transformed  is exhibited [7].

to conclude this section, let me remark that the new symmetries, which
we have uncovered, act equally well on the noninteracting ( = 0) model, for
which in fact a complete solution can be given in terms of initial data for 
and v.

(t, r)|t=0 = 0(r)

v(t, r)|t=0 = v0(r)

dene the retarded position of q(t, r) by

q + tv0(q) = r

and the solution to (1), (2) without interaction reads

v(t, r) = v0(q)

equivalent to (7) as

(t, r) = 0(q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
when  6= 0, one can eliminate  in favor of  and present a lagrangian
l = 2z drq  + ()2/2m

(38)

(39)

note that the equations of motion for  no longer involve , which serves
merely to normalize the lagrangian.
in spite of its peculiar appearance
(39) denes a galileo invariant theory, which also possesses the additional
symmetries (23) and (28).

2 relativistic model

it is possible to give a relativistic generalization of the chaplygin gas. the
appropriate lagrangian in d-spatial dimensions is

lr =z dr [   (q2c2 + a2qm2c2 + ()2 )]

= z dr [   hr]

(40)

here a is a measure of the interaction. when a = 0, the above is a relativistic
generalization (7) with  = 0. retaining a, and letting c   one nds that
(41)

lr = nmc2 + ln r|=ma2/2

although not manifestly so, lr is lorentz and poincare invariant in (d, 1)
space-time (see below), and also matter conservation is respected. thus there
are 1
2(d + 1)(d + 2) + 1 generators, where the rst number counts the poincare
generators and +1 refers to n.

when a vanishes, the model is free and elementary; a complete solution
indeed the equations of motion take the form (1) and (2) (with f

exists.

set to zero) but v is not /m, rather it is c/qm2c2 + ()2 , so that
/m = v/q1  v2/c2. consequently the solutions take the same form as
just as in the nonrelativistic case, when a 6= 0,  can be eliminated,
la = az drqm2c2  ()2

leaving the lagrangian of a born-infeld-type model.

(42)

10

and again the coupling strength disappears from the equation of motion for
, serving merely to normalize the lagrangian. manifest poincare symmetry
is now evident, and its generators can be constructed in the usual fashion
from the energy momentum tensor for (42).

in view of its analogies to the nonrelativistic model, there is no sur-
prise that the relativistic model also admits additional hidden symmetries
which leave the action invariant and take solutions into new solutions. once
can reparameterize time through a eld-dependent transformation, which
depends on the scalar

the additional symmetries give us d + 1 further generators, which sup-
plement the previously described 1
2(d + 1)(d + 2) + 1 generators, for a total
of 1
2(d + 2)(d + 3)  just the right number for the poincare group in (d + 1, 1)
space-time. and indeed upon computing the canonical lie algebra brackets
of all the generators one nds that the totality of generators closes on the
(d+1, 1) poincare group. the computation is based on the same bracket (10)
as in the nonrelativistic case [because the canonical 1-form of (40) coincides
with that of (7), and is given in (9)]. moreover the set of quantities (t, , r)
transforms as a (d + 2)-lorentz vector in cartesian components [6].

as in the nonrelativistic case, one may use the additional hidden sym-
metry transformations to map solutions into new solutions with dierent
properties. additionally, one may use the relativisticnonrelativistic connec-
tion to obtain solutions of the chaplygin gas problem by taking the c  
limit of the born-infeld solutions [9]. the born-infeld model in one spatial
dimension is completely integrable [10].

3 common ancestry

the hidden symmetries and the associated haphazard transformation laws
may be given a coherent setting by considering the nambu-goto action for
a d-brane in (d + 1) spatial dimensions, moving on (d + 1, 1) dimensional
space-time.
[a d-brane is a d-dimensional extended object: 1-brane is a
string, 2-brane is a membrane, and so on. a d-brane in (d + 1) space divides
that space in two.]

the nambu-goto action reads

ing = z d0d1    ddg
g = (1)d det

x 


x


(49)

(50)

here x  is a (d + 1, 1) target space-time (d-brane) variable, with  extending
over the range  = 0, 1, . . . , d, d + 1. the  are variables describing the ex-
tended object with  ranging  = 0, 1, . . . , d; ,  = 1, . . . , d, parameterizes
the d-dimensional d-brane, while the extended object evolves in 0.

the nambu-goto action is parameterization invariant, and we shall show
that two dierent parameterizations (light-come and cartesian) result in
the chaplygin gas and born-infeld actions. the parameterizations are xed

12

r. jackiw

as follows. for both parameterizations we choose (x 1, . . . , x d) to coincide
with (1, . . . , d) and rename them r (a d-dimensional vector).
for the light cone parameterization we dene x as 12(x 0  x d+1). x +
is renamed t and identied with 2m 0. this completes the xing of the
parameterization and the remaining variable is x, which is a function of
0 and , or after redenitions, of t and r. x is renamed as (t, r)/m and
then the nambu-goto action (49) in this parameterization coincides with the

chaplygin gas action r dtl, where l is given in (39).

for the second, cartesian parameterization x 0 is renamed ct and identi-
ed with amc0. the remaining target space variable x d+1, a function of 0
and , equivalently of t and r, is renamed (t, r)/mc. then the nambu-goto

action (49) reduces to the born-infeld action r dtla, (42).

the relation to the nambu-goto action explains the origin of the hidden
(d + 1, 1) poincare group in our two nonlinear models on (d, 1) space-time:
poincare invariance is what remains of the reparameterization invariance of
the nambu-goto action after choosing either the light-cone or cartesian pa-
rameterizations. also the nonlinear, eld dependent form of the transforma-
tion laws (22)(24), (26)(29), (43), (44), (46), (47) is understood: it arises
from the identication of some of the dependent variables (x ) with the
independent variables ().

the complete integrability of the d = 1 chaplygin gas and born-infeld
model is a consequence of the fact that both descend from a string in 2-space.
but the nambu-goto theory for that system is completely integrable [6].

we observe that in addition to the nonrelativistic descent from the born-
infeld theory to the chaplygin gas, there exists a mapping of one system on
another, and between solutions of one system and the other, because both
have the same d-brane ancestor. the mapping is achieved by passing from the
light-cone parameterization to the cartesian, or vice-versa [9]. specically
this is accomplished as follows:

chaplygin gas  born-infeld: given n r(t, r), a nonrelativistic solution,
determine t (t, r) from the equation

mc2 n r(t, r) = 2 t

all the relationships are summarized in fig. 3.

figure 3: dualities and other relations between nonlinear equations.

one cannot establish the connection of our two nonlinear equations to
the nambu-goto action in absence of the interaction, neither in the nonrel-
ativistic ( = 0) nor relativistic (a = 0) cases: one cannot eliminate  in
favor of , because in the absence of an interaction  no longer appears in
the equation of motion for . equivalently one sees that the -lagrangians
l (39) and la (42) vanish with  and a, respectively. the nambu-goto
action is normalized by the d-brane tension, which has been scaled to unity
in (49). thus the nonrelativistic and relativistic free models ( = 0 = a) in
their  forms, (7) and (40) respectively, may be viewed as a parameterized
description of tension-less d-branes.
finally we remark that the emergence of the (d + 1, 1) poincare group
from the (d, 1) galileo group can also be understood in kaluza-klein-like
construction [11].
