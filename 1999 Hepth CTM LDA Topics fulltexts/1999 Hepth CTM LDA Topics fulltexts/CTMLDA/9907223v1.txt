abstract

we show that the vacuum of the quantized massless spinor eld in 2+1-

dimensional space-time is polarized in the presence of a singular magnetic

vortex. depending on the choice of the boundary condition at the location

of the vortex, either chiral symmetry or parity is broken; the formation of

the appropriate vacuum condensates is comprehensively studied. in addition,

we nd that current, energy and other quantum numbers are induced in the

vacuum.

1 introduction

field models in 2+1-dimensional space-time have been intensively explored in recent

years. the interest to this subject is motivated by its apparent relevance for the

description of planar condensed matter systems with rather fascinating properties,

including that of high-temperature superconductivity (see, e.g., refs.[1, 2, 3, 4]). an

important role is played by the study of induced vacuum quantum numbers, in par-

ticular, induced vacuum condensates exhibiting various symmetry breaking patterns.

it has been shown that the homogeneous external magnetic eld strength induces

the chiral symmetry breaking condensate in the vacuum in the universal manner,

i.e. irrespectively of all possible types of interaction among quantized fermion elds

[5]. certain eorts have been undertaken in an attempt to generalize this result to

the case of the inhomogeneous external magnetic eld strength [6]. the aim of the

present paper (see also ref.[7]) is quite dierent, being inspired by the famous bohm-

aharonov eectm [8]  we pose the question: whether the condensate can emerge

in the vacuum even in the case of vanishing external magnetic eld strength and

vanishing interaction among quantized fermion elds? the answer will be positive,

and we shall show that the vacuum condensate can be induced by an external eld

potential rather than an external eld strength. also, all other vacuum polarization

eects in the background of the bohm-aharonov magnetic eld conguration will

be determined.

the condensate which describes the pairing of massless fermions and antifermions

in the vacuum is conventionally dened as

c(x) = ihvac|t (x)(x)|vaci,

(1)

where (x) is the operator of the second-quantized fermion eld and t denotes the

time ordering operation. in the background of external classical elds, the vacuum

expectation value of the time-ordered product of the fermion eld operators takes

form

hvac|t (x) (y)|vaci = hx|()1|yi,

(2)

where  is the covariant derivative in this background. thus, in a static back-
ground, condensate (1) is presented as

c(x) = trhx|0(i0  h)1|xi,

(3)

2

where x = (x0, x),  = (0, ),  = (0, ) and

h = i0  .

(4)

after performing the wick rotation of the time axis (x0 = i ), eq.(3) is recast
into the form

c(x) = 

1
2

trhx|0 sgn(h)|xi,

where

(5)

(6)

since hamiltonian h (4) anticommutes with matrix 0,

u > 0

1, u < 0 


.

1,

sgn(u) =


[h, 0]+ = 0,

one could anticipate that condensate (5) vanishes. however, this might not be the

case for some specic background eld congurations.

it is instructive to rewright eq.(5) as

c(x) =

i
4

  trhx| |h|1|xi.

although all -matrices are traceless, current

j (x) =

i
4

trhx| |h|1|xi,

(7)

(8)

can be nonvanishing, then its nonconservation results in the emergence of vacuum

condensate (7).

a peculiar feature of the 2+1-dimensional quantum eld theory consists in a

possibility to dene chiral invariant vacuum condensate (see, e.g., ref.[9])

p(x) =

i
2 hvac|t (x)[3, 5] (x)|vaci,

which, in a static background, is reduced to the form

p(x) = 

1
4

trhx| 0 [3, 5] sgn(h)|xi =   i(x),

(9)

(10)

3

where

i(x) =

i
8

trhx|  [3, 5] |h|1|xi.

here, 3 is the -matrix corresponding to the missing (x3) dimension and

5 = i0123.

(11)

(12)

this vacuum condensate is directly related to the vacuum spin and breaks parity.

in the present paper we consider classical static magnetic eld in at 2+1-

dimensional space-time, as an external background. thus, the covariant derivative

takes form

 =   iv(x),

(13)

where v(x) is the vector potential of the magnetic eld. the magnetic eld congu-

ration is chosen to be that of a singular vortex placed at the origin of twodimensional

space (the bohm-aharonov conguration):

v 1(x) = (0)

x2

(x1)2 + (x2)2 ,

v 2(x) = (0)

x1

(x1)2 + (x2)2 ,

  v(x) = 2(0)(x),

(14)

(15)

where (0) is the vortex ux in 2 units, i.e. in the london (2ce1) units, since

we use conventional units  = c = 1 and coupling constant e is included into vector

potential v(x). evidently, vector potential (14) is undened at the origin, i.e. the

limiting value lim|x|0 v(x) does not exist. therefore, point x = 0 is excluded,

and a certain boundary condition has to be imposed at this puncture. note that

topology of the punctured plane is characterized by winding number: 1 = z (here

1 is the rst homotopy group and z is the set of integer numbers).

hamiltonian (4) in the background of singular magnetic vortex (14)-(15) takes

form

where

h = i0rr  ir10(  i(0)),

r = 1 cos  + 2 sin ,

 = 1 sin  + 2 cos ,

(16)

(17)

4

and polar coordinates,

r =p(x1)2 + (x2)2,  = arctan(x2/x1),

are introduced.

it is natural to require that the hamiltonian be self-adjoint operator. usually,

hamiltonians in singular backgrounds are not essentially self-adjoint, and a pos-

sibility of their self-adjoint extension (see, e.g., refs.[10, 11]) has to be explored.

if a solution to this problem is found, then it yields the most general boundary

condition at the puncture1). in the case of hamiltonian (16), further restrictions

are imposed by either parity or chiral symmetry conservation. having specied the

boundary condition at the puncture, one can nd all vacuum polarization eects in

background (14)-(15).

in the next section we obtain two one-parameter families of boundary conditions

at the puncture: one is chiral invariant allowing for parity breaking, and another is

parity invariant allowing for chiral symmetry breaking. chiral symmetry breaking

eects are considered in section 3. parity breaking eects are considered in section

4. the absence of the twodimensional anomaly is demonstrated in section 5. results

are summarized in section 6. some details in the derivation of the results are outlined

in appendices a and b.

2 boundary condition at the location of a vortex

in 2+1-dimensional space-time, the cliord algebra has two inequivalent irreducible

representations which can be diered in the following way:

i012 = s,

s = 1.

(18)

1)the cases of various nonrelativistic hamiltonians in singular backgrounds are reviewed ex-

tensively in monograph [11]. the cases of the massive and massless relativistic threedimen-

sional hamiltonians in the background of a singular magnetic monopole are considered in

refs.[12, 13, 14, 15]. the case of the massive relativistic twodimensional hamiltonian in back-

ground (14)-(15) is considered in refs. [16, 17, 18, 19].

where 1, 2 and 3 are the pauli matrices, and  is the parameter varying in the
interval 0   < 2 to go over to the equivalent representations. since the algebra
of the pauli matrices is complete, there is no any other 2 2 matrix which anticom-
mutes with the above -matrices. therefore, in order to generate chiral symmetry
transformation, one has to consider a reducible 4  4 representation composed as a
direct sum of two inequivalent irreducible 2 2 ones (see, e.g., ref.[9]). taking into
account eqs.(19) and (20), we get the most general form of the 4  4 -matrices:

one can dene the parity transformation

and the chiral symmetry transformation

(24)

(25)

as well as transformations with matrix 5 replaced by i3, 1

(32)

decomposing the value of the vortex ux into the integer and fractional parts,

(0) = [[(0)]] + {| (0)|},

0  {| (0)|} < 1

(33)

([[u]] denotes the integer part of quantity u), one can note that the case of {| (0)|} = 0
is equivalent to the case of trivial topology, i.e. absence of the vortex ((0) = 0).2)
in the case of 0 < {| (0)|} < 1 the condition of regularity at the puncture r = 0 can
be imposed on the modes with n 6= n0 only, where

(36)

2)this conrms once more the general fact that a singular magnetic vortex is physically unob-

servbale at integer values of the vortex ux [8]. it was as far back as 1931 that dirac used actually

this fact to obtain his remarkable condition for the magnetic monopole quantization [20].

(37)

thus, the partial hamiltonians corresponding to n 6= n0 are essentially self-
adjoint when dened on the domain of regular functions, and that is only the partial

hamiltonian corresponding to n = n0 that needs a self-adjoint extension. the

method of self-adjoint extensions (see, e.g., refs.[10, 11]) is employed in appendix a,

resulting in a boundary condition which entails the irregular behaviour of the mode

with n = n0 at the puncture r = 0. actually, there are two dierent possibilities

to choose a physically reasonable boundary condition: one is chiral invariant and

parity violating, while another is parity invariant and chiral symmetry violating.

the chiral invariant choice is

dierent irregular behaviours of the f and g components, and (u) is the euler

gamma function; note that, since eqs.(38) and (40) are periodic in  with period

2, all permissible values of  can be restricted, without a loss of generality, to
range     .

concluding this section, let us note that conditions (38) and (40) coincide in the

case of

cos  = 0,

(43)

due to vanishing of either their left-hand sides (at  = s 
(at  = s 
eq.(43).

2 ) or their right-hand sides
2 ) .thus, both parity and chiral symmetry are conserved in the case of

3 chiral symmetry breaking

let us consider vacuum polarization eects under the parity invariant condition (40).

using the complete set of solutions (35), (36) and (41), we can evaluate current j (x)

(8). since angular component

j(x) =

i

trhx| |h|1|xi

vanishes, there remains only radial component

jr(x) =

i
4

trhx|r |h|1|xi,

(44)

(45)

which can be obviously presented as a sum over the upper and lower inequivalent

irreducible representations:

jr(x) = j +

r (x) + j 

r (x).

(46)

10

we nd that that the contribution of regular modes (35) and (36) is cancelled,

[j +

r (x)]reg = [j 

r (x)]reg,

while the contribution of irregular mode (41) survives,

[j +

r (x)]irreg = [j

consequently, we get

(51)

incidentally, one can verify that current i(x) (11) vanishes. extending the integrand

in eq.(49) to the complex k-plane, using the cauchy theorem to deform the contour

of integration (for more details see refs.[18, 19]) and introducing the dimensionless

integration variable, we recast eq.(49) into the form

(52)

where

k(w) =

[i(w)  i(w)]

is the macdonald function of order  (i(w) is the modied bessel function of order
). taking into account the invariance of eq.(52) under s  s, we rewrite it as

tan(

).

finally, taking into account eqs.(7)-(8) and relations

j(x) = 0,

  j (x) = r1r[rjr(x)],

we get the following expression for vacuum condensate (5):

c(x) = 

sin({| (0)|})

(56)

note that the integral in eq.(53) is ill-dened at half-integer values of the vortex

ux (at {| (0)|} = 1
values of the vortex ux. in particular, taking into account relation

2 ). on the contrary, the integral in eq.(56) is well dened at all

22r2 .

(57)

(58)

since current j (x) plays a merely supplementary role and the quantity of physical
signicance is condensate c(x), one can just pay no attention to a divergence of the
integral in eq.(53) at {| (0) |} = 1
2. however, this divergence reveals itself when
considering the total condensate,

c =z d2xc(x),

which can be rewritten as

c = 2{[rjr(x)]|r=  [rjr(x)]|r=0}.

(59)

(60)

therefore, we show in appendix b, how regularization with the help of mass pa-

rameter m can be introduced consistently. in particular, after the removal of the
regularization parameter (m  0) we nd

sgn(cos )rjr(x)|{|(0)|}= 1

2

= .

(61)

12

we nd also that the regularized version of eq.(60),

c(m ) = 2{[rjr(x|m)]|r=  [rjr(x|m)]|r=0},

(62)

takes an innite value at {| (0) |} = 1
2 . this value is in accordance with the direct
evaluation of total condensate (59) using the explicit form of eq.(56), which yields:

c = 

sgn(cos )
|2{| (0)|}  1|

.

(63)

note that all above quantities are certainly vanishing in the case when eq.(43) holds.

what about other vacuum polarization eects? the vacuum energy density can

ularize the infrared divergence, while the ultraviolet divergence is regularized by
means of complex parameter z: functions x(z|m) and  (0)
x (z|m) are evaluated at
re z > 1 and then analytically continued to the whole complex z-plane (see refs.

[21, 22, 23]). note that the zeta function density in the trivial background takes

form

x (z|m) = |m|2(1z)

let us also dene the conventional vacuum current,

since the radial component of the vacuum current is not induced, eqs.(56), (70) and

(71) comprise all eects of the vacuum polarization in background (14)-(15) under

condition (40). at half-integer values of the vortex ux, eqs.(70) and (71) take form

vortex, depending only on the distance from the vortex. at large distances they are

4 parity breaking

let us consider vacuum polarization eects under the chiral invariant condition (38).

using the complete set of solutions (35), (36) and (39), we nd immediately

j +
r (x) = j 

r (x),

(77)

and, consequently, current j (x) (8) vanishes. concerning current i(x) (11), we

nd

and

i(x) = 0

i +
r (x) = i 

r (x).

(78)

(79)

the contribution of regular solutions (35) and (36) is cancelled upon summation

over the sign of energy, while the contribution of irregular solution (39) survives,

resulting in

ir(x) =

s sin({| (0)|})

3r2



z0

dw

k{|(0)|}(w)k1{|(0)|}(w)

cosh[(2{| (0)|}  1) ln( w

r ) + ln a]

.

(80)

consequently, we get the following expression for vacuum condensate (10):

p(x) = 

s sin({| (0)|})

3r2

.

(81)

as well as in the case considered in the previous section, energy density (70) and

current (71) are also induced in the vacuum. however, there are additional vacuum

polarization eects in the case of the chiral invariant condition (38).

let us dene vacuum fermion number density

vacuum spin density

n (x) = 

1

trhx| sgn(h)|xi,

s(x) =

and vacuum angular momentum density

(82)

(83)

(84)

as it has been already noted in introduction, the vacuum spin density is directly

related to the parity breaking vacuum condensate:

s(x) =

1
2 p(x).

(85)

as to remaining vacuum densities (82) and (84), in background (14)-(15) under

condition (38), they take form

n (x) = 

s sin({| (0)|})

thus, contrary to the parity breaking condensate ,

the vacuum fermion number and angular momentum vanish at half-integer values

of the vortex ux . at large distances from the vortex, we get

5 absence of twodimensional anomaly

omitting the time dimension (i.e. putting x0 = const), let us dene twodimensional

euclidean eective action functional

se[v(x)] =  lnz d d exp(z d2x h) =  ln det h.

the last equation is formally invariant under transformation

  ei,

  ei,

where  is a matrix which anticommutes with the hamiltonian,

[h, ]+ = 0,

tr = 0,

2 = i.

(94)

(95)

(96)

the invariance under the localized (coordinate dependent) generalization of trans-

formation (95) corresponds to the conservation law:

where

  j3(x) = 0,

j3(x) = i trhx| 0  h 1|xi.

17

(97)

(98)

however, both functional (94) and current (98) are ill-dened, suering from ultra-

violet as well as infrared divergences. performing the regularization of divergences

with the use of the zeta function method [21, 22, 23], one arrives at, instead of

eq.(97), the following relation:

where

  j3(x) = 2 lim

z0

lim
m 0

x(z|m),

x(z|m) = trhx| (h 2 + m 2)z|xi

(99)

(100)

is the modied zeta function density (compare with eq.(65)).

in the reducible 4  4 representation of the cliord algebra (see eq.(21)), the

role of  can be played by each of the following four matrices:

0,

03,

05,

1
2

0[3, 5] .

however, only one choice,

 =

1
2

0[3, 5],

(101)

can lead to the nonvanishing modied zeta function density and, thus, to the

anomaly in the conservation of the appropriate current,

j3(x) =

1
2i

trhx|  [3, 5] h 1|xi.

(102)

reecting a generic relationship between eq.(102) and current i(x) (11), this

anomaly is usually called as the parity anomaly.

the question that we would like to address in the present section is: whether

singular magnetic vortex (14)-(15) induces the parity anomaly or not? it is clear

that the parity anomaly is absent under the parity invariant condition (40). so

there remains to check the absence of the parity anomaly under the chiral invariant

condition (38). similarly to that in the above sections, we nd that

x(z|m) =

it is more instructive to take limit m  0 rst and then to consider limit z  0.

x(0|0) = 0,

which ensures the validity of eq.(97) everywhere on the plane with the puncture at

x = 0.

6 conclusion

before discussing our results, let us recall the well-known fact: a regular congu-
ration of external magnetic eld strength   v(x) in 2+1-dimensional space-time

19

induces the parity anomaly [24, 25, 26],

  j3(x) =

2 s


  v(x) ,

as well as the chiral symmetry breaking vacuum condensate [5],

c(x) = 

1
2 |  v(x)| .

(110)

(111)

these relations exhibit a direct (or local) impact of an external eld strength on

a quantized fermion eld. if one excludes the spatial region of nonvanishing eld

strength and imposes a physically sensible condition at the boundary of the ex-

cluded region, what happens then with a quantized fermion eld in the remaining

part of space? basing merely on eqs.(110) and (111), one could expect that both

the anomaly and the condensate vanish in the region of vanishing eld strength.

however, as it is shown in the present paper, these naive expectations are justied

for the anomaly only (see section 5), whereas the condensate and other vacuum

quantum numbers appear to be nonvanishing, thus exhibiting an indirect (or nonlo-

cal) impact of an external eld strength, which may be regarded (see, e.g., ref.[14])

as a leak through the boundary of the excluded region.

to be more precise, we consider the situation when the volume of the excluded

region is shrunk to zero, while the global characteristics of an external eld strength

(ux) is retained nonvanishing. therefore, singular magnetic vortex (14)-(15) is

taken as an external eld conguration. the boundary condition at the location of

the vortex has to ensure self-adjointness of the hamiltonian. we nd two sets of

boundary conditions  one is chiral invariant (38) and another is parity invariant

(40); each set is labelled by the self-adjoint extension parameter. thus, vacuum

polarization eects in the background of a singular magnetic vortex are depending

both on the vortex ux and the self-adjoint extension parameter.

as it should be expected, the vacuum polarization eects remain invariant under

the transition to the equivalent representation of the cliord algebra (i.e. do not

depend on ). if the parity invariant condition (40) is imposed, then the vacuum

polarization eects are invariant under the transition to the inequivalent represen-

tation of the cliord algebra (i.e. do not depend on s). they comprise chiral

20

symmetry breaking vacuum condensate (56), vacuum energy density (70) and vac-

uum current (71). if the chiral invariant condition (38) is imposed, then the vacuum
polarization eects are either invariant or changing sign under s  s. the in-
variant eects comprise vacuum energy density (70) and vacuum current (71), while

the changing sign eects comprise parity breaking vacuum condensate (81), vacuum

fermion number density (86) and vacuum angular momentum density (87). all vac-

uum polarization eects are decreasing as inverse powers (with integer exponents in

the cases of vacuum energy density and current, and with fractional exponents oth-

erwise) at large distances from the vortex, see eqs.(74)-(76) and (89). total vacuum

condensates are nite at non-half-integer values of the vortex ux, see eqs.(63) and

(91). total vacuum fermion number and angular momentum are nite, vanishing at

half-integer values of the vortex ux, see eqs.(92) and (93).

it should be noted that both conditions (38) and (40) become scale invariant at

half-integer values of the vortex ux. thus, eq.(58) exhibits a scale invariant pattern

of chiral symmetry breaking. other scale invariant eects are given by vacuum

energy density (72), vacuum current (73) and parity breaking vacuum condensate
(88). the innite value of total vacuum condensates (63) and (91) at {| (0) |} = 1
is a consequence of scale invariance.

2

finally, let us discuss the case of eq.(43) when conditions (38) and (40) coincide.

a distinctive feature in this case is that two of the four components of wave function

(31) become regular for all n: if  = s 
if  = s 
as well as scale symmetry, are conserved, and only energy density and current are

n components are regular. parity and chiral symmetry,

n components are regular, and,

let h be the operator in the form of eqs.(a.1)-(a.2), which acts on the domain

of functions (0)(r) that are regular at r = 0. then its adjoint h which is dened

by relation

dr r[h(r)](0)(r) =z 

0

dr r[(r)][h(0)(r)]

(a.3)

acts on the domain of functions (r) that are not necessarily regular at r = 0. so the

question is, whether the domain of denition of h can be extended, resulting in both

the operator and its adjoint being dened on the same domain of functions? to an-

swer this, one has to construct the eigenspaces of h with complex eigenvalues. they

are spanned by the linearly independent square-integrable solutions correspoding to

the pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues,

h(1)(r) = i(1)(r),

h(2)(r) = i(2)(r),

where  > 0 is inserted merely for the dimension reasons. it can be shown that, in

the case of eqs.(a.1)-(a.2), only one pair of such solutions exists:

n is a certain normalization factor. thus the deciency index of each of operators

h+ and h is equal to (1,1). then, according to the weyl - von neumann theory of

self-adjoint operators (see refs.[10, 11]), the self-adjoint extension of operator h is

dened on the domain of functions of the following form

(a.7)

where c is a complex constant and (s) is a real continuous parameter which de-

pends on s. using the asymptotics of the macdonald function at small values of

the variable, we nd that operator (a.1)-(a.2) is self-adjoint when dened on the

domain of functions with the following asymptotic behaviour:
