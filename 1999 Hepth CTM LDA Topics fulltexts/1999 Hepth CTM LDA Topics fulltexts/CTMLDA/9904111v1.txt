abstract: we discuss aspects of recent novel approaches towards understanding the
large n limit of matrix eld theories with local or global non-abelian symmetry.

the large n limit of eld theories whose local degrees of freedom are n  n matrices
continues to intrigue physicists since its discovery by t hooft 25 years ago [1]. this is
striking given the fact that no eld theory with propagating matrix degrees of freedom
has up to now been exactly solved by large n techniques. certainly, one reason for this
continuing interest is the signicant evidence that this limit indeed entails important
simplications. furthermore, in the most interesting cases, physics appears to be not too
dierent as compared to the nite n case. lastly, a new aspect of large n has appeared
over the years: n =  may not only be a reasonable and tractable approximation to some
theory, but may also dene the theory. indeed, we know this to be true in some simple
cases such as non-critical string theory, and now there are serious proposals for the case
of real (i.e. critical, supersymmetric) string theory and 11-dimensional m-theory.

one of the above mentioned simplications that seems to occur can be roughly sum-

marized by the correspondence

matrix eld theory

(1)

that is, it appears that every matrix eld theory can be replaced by a suitable matrix
integral such that at least some of the physical observables on both sides become identical
at n = . a rst instance of this was discovered by eguchi and kawai [2], but we now
know quite a few further examples, and a much more general principle, as loosely stated
in the equivalence (1), appears to be at work.

in part 1 we will discuss a naive (presumably too naive) version of the correspondence
(1) for yang-mills eld theory, where we point out that a surprisingly simple reduced
matrix model, contrary to initial expectations, proves to be well-dened for large n. our
main point here is that the existence of the proposed yang-mills matrix integrals has
been overlooked in the past, and that they are, apart from other important applications,

an ideal laboratory for testing new large n gauge theory techniques. part 2 deals with
known exact equivalences (1) for interacting d-dimensional lattice eld theories with
global u(n) symmetry, and we outline, taking as a specic example a d = 2 hermitian
model, a very general procedure for bootstrapping the n =  solution.

1 local u (n ): yang-mills integrals

in this part we discuss some aspects of results obtained in collaboration with w. krauth
and h. nicolai and published in [3],[4],[5]. consider d-dimensional pure su(n) yang-
mills eld theory and, inspired by the principle (1), reduce it by brute force to zero
dimensions. the continuum path integral, involving traceless hermitian gauge connections
x, becomes an ordinary matrix integral:

zd,n = z

n 21

d

ya=1

y=1

dx a

exp(cid:20) 1

tr [x, x][x, x](cid:21).

(2)

note that gauge xing is no longer required here, since the overcounting of gauge-equivalent
congurations involves merely a factor of the compact, nite volume of the gauge group:
space time has become a point (or more precisely, an innitesimal torus, since the point
still keeps a sense of the d directions.). now, as was explained in [6], the integral eq.(2)
still knows something about d-dimensional space-time. indeed, shifting

x  p + x

(3)

  pj

, . . . , pn

by diagonal matrices p =diag(p1
 ) we formally recover feynman rules which look
like the ordinary ones except that the momentum integrations are replaced by sums over
discretized momenta pi
. as n   one might hope that the sums turn back into
loop integrals, motivating the correspondence (1). now in [6] a somewhat complicated
quenching and gauge xing procedure was introduced in order to ensure the recovery of
the eld theory. indeed it would seem at rst sight that the integral eq.(2) is meaningless
without the procedure of [6] since there are unconstrained at directions in integration
space, due to mutually commuting matrices. however, the monte carlo results of [4]
suggest

proposition 1a: the yang-mills integrals zd,n exist i n > d
d2.
it would be quite important to nd methods enabling one to rigorously prove this state-
ment, or even calculate the partition sums zd,n . some important analytic evidence comes
from the perturbative calculations of [7]. for su(2), a proof of the proposition, as well
as an analytic expression for zd,2, is known.
d = 4, 6, 10. these read

the matrix integrals eq.(2) have beautiful supersymmetric extensions in dimensions

where we have supersymmetrically added n = 2(d  2) hermitian fermionic matrices
 to the models. the d = 10 model corresponds to the dimensional reduction of
the maximally supersymmetric conformal d = 4,n = 4 yang-mills eld theory to zero

it is also the crucial ingredient in the ikkt model for iib superstrings
dimensions.
[8], which however, instead of taking the large n limit, sums z 16
10,n over all values of n.
following the su(2) calculations of [9], the perturbative arguments of [10], the arguments
of [11], the calculations of [12], and our monte carlo work, we are led to

proposition 1b: the susy yang-mills integrals z 4
the analytic results of these integrals are believed to be known, and a rigorous mathe-
matical proof would be welcome.

it is interesting to understand the similarities and dierences of these little studied
new matrix models eqs.(2),(4), whose existence has been missed until recently, in rela-
tion to the conventional old matrix models of wigner type. a crucial quantity in the old
matrix models is the distribution of eigenvalues of the random matrices. an interesting
novel feature of the new matrix models is the fact that, at nite n, only a nite number of
one-matrix moments exist. the numerical results agree with perturbative powercounting
arguments, and one is led, for the bosonic models eq.(2), to

proposition 2a: d 1

n tr x 2k

1 e <  i k < n(d  2)  3

2 d + 2,

while in the supersymmetric cases d = 4, 6, 10 eq.(4) one has

proposition 2b: d 1

n tr x 2k

1 e <  i k < d  3.

once again, except for su(2), rigorous proofs of these conjectures are missing. these
ndings indicate that in the new matrix models the density of eigenvalues falls o much
slower (powerlike) than in the old ones (exponential). as n   the bosonic densities
behave once again rather conservatively (innitely many moments exist), while for the
susy densities the behavior indicated in proposition 2b is independent of n.

a much more dicult question is whether these models might lead to a self-quenching
eect where a background p (in eq.(3)), bearing some resemblance to real yang-mills
theory, is dynamically generated as n  .
the above yang-mills integrals have many applications even at nite n (for a recent
unexpected one see [15]); however, here we would like to stress that they constitute an
ideal laboratory for developing new large n techniques aimed at making progress with
t hoofts large n qcd [1].

2 global u (n ): master partitions

the problem of nding the n =  solution to matrix eld theories has not even been
solved in the presumably simpler case of models with a global u(n) symmetry. the main
obstacle has been that no systematic procedure was known to reduce the local number
of degrees of freedom from o(n 2) to o(n). in [13] we outlined a general approach for
achieving such a reduction for any eld theory with a global matrix symmetry. let us
sketch the idea in the specic example of an interacting d = 2 hermitian scalar eld
theory. it is convenient to put the theory on a lattice:

z = z yx dm(x) es ,

2 x=1,2

m(x)4 

[m(x)m(x + ) + m(x)m(x  )](cid:21),

s = ntr xx (cid:20) 1
where the eld variables are n  n hermitian matrices m(x) dened on the square lattice
sites x and  denotes the unit vector in the -direction. the measure is the usual at
measure on hermitian matrices. the rst step consists in applying the reduction principle
(1). naively reducing the system as in the previous section down to a single point results
in an ordinary one-matrix model where the information on the 2d lattice is lost. a more
careful reduction has to hide the propagation on the lattice in group space; here we will
use the beautiful procedure of twisting, see [14] and references therein. using the n n
weyl-t hooft matrices

as a second step we need to reduce the number of variables from n 2 to n. the brute
force approach would be to diagonalize the matrix m and perform the integration over
the unitary diagonalizing matrix. one would then obtain an eective action for the n
eigenvalues of m. however, calculations at small n show that this eective action is
extremely complicated in the case at hand. on the other hand, if we change variables
from the eigenvalues to partitions, corresponding to a fourier transform in group space,
something very interesting happens. the n variables dual to the n eigenvalues are the
young weights hi = n  i + mi, i = 1, . . . , n, where the mi are the lengths of the ith row
in the young diagram corresponding to the partition. denoting the partitions through
h = (h1, . . . , hn ), the dual representation of the integral eq.(7) is found to be

z = xh ih lh 

|h|
2 ,

(8)

where instead of an integration over the n  n matrix m we now have a sum over
all partitions h of the non-negative integer |h| = 0, 1, 2, . . .. here ih contains all the
information on the interaction, and essentially requires the general correlation function of
the u(n)-invariant one-matrix integral

which are known. here h(m) are the schur functions on h which are nothing but
a complete set of of class functions (non-abelian fourier modes) on the group. the
information on the lattice is contained in the lattice polynomials

n of maximal degree

. the lh are easily shown to be polynomials in the variable 1
2|h|  1.
now the result of this harmonic analysis is that the terms to be summed over partitions
in eq.(8) factorize into a piece ih containing the information on the local interaction and
and the piece lh containing the information on the space-time structure. since there are
only n variables hi we expect the sum eq.(8) to be dominated at n =  by a saddle
point, i.e. an eective master partition. in a third and nal step we will need to write
the full system of bootstrap equations for the saddle point. this will require a deeper
analysis of the lattice polynomials. but it should be clear that the problem of solving the
large n lattice eld theory has been reformulated in a rather non-trivial way: in fact, the
interacting theory (i.e. g 6= 0 in eq.(5)) is no harder to solve in this dual space of young
weights than the free theory (g = 0).
