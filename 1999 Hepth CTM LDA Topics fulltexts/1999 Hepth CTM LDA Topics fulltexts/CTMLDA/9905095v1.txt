abstract

we calculate the induced lorentz- and cpt-violating chern-simons term
arising from the lorentz- and cpt-violating sector of quantum electrodynam-
ics with a b 5 term. the result to all orders in b coincides with the
previous linear-in-b calulation by chung and oh [hep-th/9812132] as well as
jackiw and kostelecky [phys. rev. lett. 82, 3572 (1999)], since all higher
order terms vanish.

recently, colladay and kostelecky [1] posed the question whether a lorentz- and cpt-
violating chern-simons term [2] is induced when the lorentz- and cpt-violating term b/5
(b a constant 4-vector) is added to the conventional lagrangian of qed [3]. this has been
discussed by a number of authors [49].
in refs. [1,47], only the term linear in b was
kept in the calculation of the vacuum polarization (which determines the induced chern-
simons term). a calculation of higher order (in b) corrections was attempted by fosco and
le guillou [8]. however, their non-trivial result is invalid because they use an incorrect
fermion propagator. after completion of our exact, i.e., non-perturbative in b, calculation,
we received a paper by perez-victoria [9], in which the same calculation was carried out,
with the same result as we report here: for b < m all higher order terms vanish.

consider a dirac fermion propagating in a lorentz- and cpt-violating manner in the

background of a photon eld. the lagrangian of this system is
l = i /  m   b/5  a/ ,

(1)

where b is a constant 4-vector, and b
fermion propagator is

5 is the lorentz violating, cpt-odd term. the

if we observe the following relation

g(p) =

i

p/  m  b/5

.

(p/  m  b/5)(p/ + m  b/5)(p/ + m + b/5)(p/  m + b/5)

= (p2  m2  b2)2  4(pb)2 + 4p2b2 ,

we can readily rationalize the propagator, eq. (2), as follows:

where

g =

i

p/  m  b/5

=

i(u + v 5)

d

,

u = (p2  m2 + b2)(p/ + m)  2mb2  2pbb/ ,
v = (p2  m2 + b2)b/  (2pb + 2mb/)(p/  m) ,
d = (p2  m2  b2)2  4(pb)2 + 4p2b2 .

the vacuum polarization tensor is given by

(p) = z

d4k
(2)4 tr[g(p + k)g(k)] ,

and its antisymmetric part has the following general structure:

[] 

1
2

(  )

= pb(p2, pb, b2) + (pb  bp)f (p2, pb, b2) .

the derivative of [] with respect to the external momentum p at p = 0 gives

[](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p=0

= b(0, 0, b2) + (gb  gb)f (0, 0, b2) .

the rst term on the right-hand side of the above equation produces the induced chern-
simons term in the eective action as follows:

b(0, 0, b2) .

since our concern here is to obtain the induced chern-simon term, we do not consider the
second term on the right-hand side of eq. (6); we only collect terms propotional to 
from 
[]|p=0. the complicated trace algebra contains eight gamma matrices together
p
with 5. we perform these trace calculations using the package feynpar.m which runs in
the mathematica system. (if interested readers request the trace calculation program, the
author will gladly provide it.) after the trace calculation, we are left with the momentum
integral:

b(0, 0, b2) = 4ib z

where

r1 = b8  2b6k2 + 2b2k6 + k8  6b6m2  4b4k2m2 + 2b2k4m2
 12b4m4 + 6b2k2m4  6k4m4  10b2m6 + 8k2m6  3m8 ,

r2 = 8b4 + 4b2k2  8k4  4k6/b2 + 28b2m2  16k2m2

+ 12k4m2/b2 + 24m4  12k2m4/b2 + 4m6/b2 ,

r3 = 16 + 16k2/b2  16m2/b2 .

in order to perform this 4-dimensional minkowski-momentum integral, we rst change the
time-component of the k and b vectors, k0 and b0, into

k0  k4 = ik0 ,
b0  b4 = ib0 ,

to get an eucledian metric. this is allowed as long as b2 < m2. then we use 4-dimensional
spherical polar coordinates. furthermore, with replacements k2 = m2x and b2 = m2y, and
an introduction of a parameter , which is set to zero before the radial k (or x) integration,
in the following fashion:

c = 16x2y(x  y + 1) ,

the nal result of our calculation is

(0, 0, b2) =

from eqs. (10) and (7), we nd that the strength of the induced chern-simons term is given
as

k =

3b
162 .

(11)

this coincides with the previous result by chung and oh [4] as well as by jackiw and
kostelecky [5], in which the b-linear contribution to the induced chern-simons term was
calculated. we understand the identity of the lowest-order calculation with the all-order
calculation by following an argument of coleman and glashow [10], (communicated to us
by s. coleman via r. jackiw). consider expanding the b-dependent vacuum polarization
amplitude in powers of b (b-perturbation theory).
in nth order there is a two-index, i.e.
two-photon, amplitude, with n chiral insertions (of b/5). all except the rst order are free of
linear divergences. (abelian axial anomalies come only from the triangle graph! [11]) hence
there is no ambiguity in evaluating the higher order graphs, and the coleman-glashow
trick may be used: momentarily let each of the two photons carry dierent momenta,
say p1 and p2 (this means that the chiral insertions carry non-zero momentum); from gauge
invariance (transversality) in each of the photons, we learn that the amplitude is o(p1) and
o(p2); i.e.
it is o(p1p2); now go to equal momenta, p1 = p2 = p, and observe that the
amplitude must be o(p2). the chern-simons term one is seeking is o(p); hence all these
higher-order graphs do not contribute. the only contribution comes from the lowest order,
which is regularization dependent (or unique if the method of evaluation by jackiw and
kostelecky [5] is adopted).
