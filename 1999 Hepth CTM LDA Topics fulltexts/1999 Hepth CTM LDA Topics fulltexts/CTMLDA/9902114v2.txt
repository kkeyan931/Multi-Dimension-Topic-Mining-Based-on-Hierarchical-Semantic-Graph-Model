abstract: in this paper we present a renormalizability proof for spontaneously bro-
ken su (2) gauge theory. it is based on flow equations, i.e. on the wilson renormal-
ization group adapted to perturbation theory. the power counting part of the proof,
which is conceptually and technically simple, follows the same lines as that for any
other renormalizable theory. the main diculty stems from the fact that the regular-
ization violates gauge invariance. we prove that there exists a class of renormalization
conditions such that the renormalized green functions satisfy the slavnov-taylor iden-
tities of su (2) yang-mills theory on which the gauge invariance of the renormalized
theory is based.

1 introduction

in the early seventies wilson and his collaborators published their ideas on the renormaliza-
tion group and eective lagrangians [wiko], which have stimulated the progress of quantum
eld theory and statistical mechanics ever since. in 1984 polchinski [pol] showed that these
ideas are suited as a basis for perturbative renormalization theory.1 he proved euclidean
massive 4
4 to be renormalizable without introducing feynman diagrams, thus sidestepping
the associated complicated analysis of their divergence/convergence properties. instead, the
problem is solved by bounding inductively the solutions of a system of rst order dieren-
tial equations, the flow equations (fe), which are a reduction of the wilson fe to their
perturbative content.
over the past decade polchinskis argument has been considerably simplied technically,
extended to physical renormalization conditions and has been rendered rigorous [kksa].
beyond it has been applied, again in mathematical rigour, to nearly all situations of physical
interest: the 4
4 proof itself already also holds for any other massive theory with global sym-
metries only and renormalizable power counting, like e.g. the yukawa-models, o(n)-models
etc. it could then be extended to euclidean massless 4
4 [kk1] and qed4 [kk2] and also
to theories in minkowski-space [kksc]. the fe method also served to extract properties
of, or bounds on green functions which were harder - if at all - to get by other methods.
we mention composite operator renormalization together with (generalized) zimmermann
identities [kk3], wilsons operator product expansion [kk4], symanzik improvement in the
convergence of the regularized theory [ke1, wie], de calan-rivasseau large order bounds
on perturbation theory [ke2], bounds on the singularities of green functions at exceptional
momenta [kk1], analyticity properties of green functions in minkowski space [kksc] and
decoupling theorems [kim]. a recent review (in german) on previous work on fes can be
found in [kop]. we should also mention that the interest in fes over the last decade goes far
beyond mathematical physics and has led to many interesting results, ideas and calculations
in theoretical physics. to give few examples we mention that critical exponents for 4
4-type
theories have been calculated in [tewe]. truncated fe have also been applied to the bound
state problem in [ell], to yang-mills theory in [ehw], in particular to the study of vacuum
condensates in [rewe].

among the entries in our list on solved renormalization problems there is still one missing,
which is of fundamental importance in physics, namely nonabelian gauge theory. the present
paper is intended to close this gap by treating spontaneously broken su(2)-yang-mills theory,

1wilson himself remarked already in the late sixties that this should be possible, as we learned from e.

brezin.

which corresponds to the weak sector of the standard model.2 another interesting problem,
which should be studied, is qcd where the problem of gauge invariance is intertwined with
the infrared problem. since the latter has already been extensively studied we chose the
spontaneously broken theory which is infrared nite and thus simpler. on the other hand
the slavnov-taylor identities (sti) or ward identities of the spontaneously broken symmetry
are more complicated to analyse.3

the (ultraviolet) power counting part of the fe renormalization proof is (up to nota-
tional and other minor changes) the same and simple for all the above mentioned theories,
which renders the method attractive. gauge theories, however, present a diculty coming
from the wellknown fact that gauge symmetry is broken by cutos in momentum space, and
it is just the ow of such a cuto which produces the fe. what we have to show is that
gauge invariance is restored when the cutos are taken away. on the level of the green
functions (which are not gauge invariant) this means that we have to verify the sti of the
theory. they then allow to argue that physical quantities such as the s-matrix are gauge-
invariant[zij]. on analysing the fe for a gauge theory one realizes that the restoration of
the sti depends on the choice of the renormalization conditions chosen and cannot be true
in general. more precisely, since gauge invariance is violated in the regularized theory, the
renormalization group ow will generally produce nonvanishing contributions to all those
relevant parameters of the theory, which are forbidden by gauge invariance, e.g. a nonin-
variant gauge eld selfcoupling of the form ( ~a2)2. the question is then: can we use the
freedom in adjusting the renormalization conditions such that the sti are nevertheless re-
stored in the end? to answer this question a rst observation, already encountered when
treating qed, is crucial: the violation of the sti in the regularized theory can be expressed
through green functions carrying an operator insertion, which depends on the regulators.
fe theory for such insertions tells us that these green functions will vanish once the cutos
are removed, if we achieve renormalization conditions on the theory such that the inserted
green functions (uniquely calculated from those) have vanishing renormalization conditions
for all relevant terms, i.e. up to the dimension of the insertion (which is 5 in our case).
comparing the number of relevant terms for the su(2) theory - 37 (see app.a)- and for the
insertion - 53 (see app.c)-, we realize that it is not possible to make vanish 53 terms on
adjusting 37 free parameters, unless there are linear interdependences. it is again the fe

2 for vanishing weinberg angle. this is however not of decisive importance for the line of the argument.
it matters insofar as the explicit description and treatment of the whole su(2)u(1)-theory would require
much more space.

3 we mention also that fe and sti for pure yang-mills theory in the limit case without uv cuto have

been considered in [bam2].

3

(in its global integrated form) which helps us to make transparent these interdependences.
the problem of how to nd ones way through the sti and adjusting the renormalization
conditions appropriately is somewhat complicated through spontaneous symmetry breaking,
since the latter mixes green functions of dierent dimension.

one may of course ask the question whether such a proof of the renormalizability of
yang-mills theory is still necessary in view of the fact that the problem has been settled
in the seventies by the pioneering work of t hooft and veltman and successors. with-
out going into details or giving references on work which has made entrance into nearly all
textbooks on quantum eld theory or particle physics we would still like to mention that
there rests a bit of uneasiness on the mathematical physicists side on the form in which
the subject has settled in the course of time. this is because the standard way in which
the argument is presented nowadays is based on two main ingredients: the existence of an
invariant regularization scheme, i.e. dimensional regularization, and algebraic manipula-
tions on generating functionals, which can be given rigorous meaning for regularized path
integral formulations. to date nobody has achieved a (rigorous) denition of dimensionally
regularized path integrals so that there remains a gap in the reasoning which could only be
closed if the analysis of the sti were directly performed on individual feynman graphs, a
presumably awkward procedure. these arguments do not apply to the lattice regularization
4, which allows for a (particularly transparent) path integral formulation while respecting
gauge invariance. it violates euclidean or lorentz symmetry however. we emphasize the
work of rei as a largely coherent and rigorous analysis of the perturbative renormalization
problem of (qcd type) gauge theories on the lattice [rei]. his work is based on an adap-
tation of bphz renormalization to the lattice, where quite a number of new problems appear.

as a guide to the logical structure of the paper we now expose the main line of arguments.
our starting point is a massive uv regularized theory. the generating functional l,0 of the
connected amputated green functions (cag) with momenta in the interval [, 0] satises
a ow equation (35) with respect to , which when reduced to its perturbative content (37)
permits to bound inductively the l-loop n-point functions l,0
in such a way (39, 43) that
their existence for 0   becomes obvious. this is true for all theories renormalizable by
power counting under the condition that all relevant terms, i.e. local terms of mass dimension
 4 are xed by (0-independent) renormalization conditions (r.c.). in gauge theories the
number of such terms is generally much bigger than the number of free parameters of the
theory. for our model the respective numbers are 37 (listed in app.a) and 8 (cf. (121)).

l,n

4the above mentioned algebraic analysis is however based on the continuum formulation.

4

so most of the r.c. cannot be freely chosen for a gauge theory. a priori it does not seem
possible to guess which r.c. are the right ones.

(see app.c) are functions of the 37 r.c.

thus we analyse the action l0,0 for general r.c. and expose the violation of the sti as a
functional associated with an operator insertion, which turns out to be of dimension 5. we
denote it as l1 = l0,0
(75). this is achieved on using an uv regularized version (62, 66) of
the brs transformation (13, 14, 18). general results from fe theory tell us that l0,0
1 will
vanish for 0   if all its relevant terms, i.e. the local parts of dimension  5, are xed to
be 0 by the r.c. and if the irrelevant terms in l0,0
vanish suciently rapidly for 0  
(110). the 53 renormalization parts for l0,0
for
l0,0 and 7 free parameters in the brs transformation (see app.b). thus if the model can
be renormalized respecting the sti there must be linear interdependences among the 53
relations. these are not explicit in the theory l0,0, since l0,0 contains irrelevant terms
of arbitrary dimension which are not known explicitly. we therefore derive the violated
slavnov-taylor identities (vsti) also in terms of the bare functionals l0,0 and l0,0
(98,
99), using again the fe for that purpose. the fe may also be used (104, 113-120) to relate
l0,0
with each other (111, 112) so that - respecting the inductive procedure, i.e.
climbing up in the loop order l, and for given l in the number of external legs n - we may
hope to satisfy the sti (for 0  ) as well by imposing the relevant terms in l0,0
to
vanish (instead of those in l0,0
). since l0,0 does not contain unknown5 irrelevant terms
an explicit analysis of the bare sti is possible, and we can make vanish 53 terms order by
order in l on appropriately xing l0,0 and the free brs constants. however starting at
the wrong end - i.e. xing counter terms instead of r.c. - we cannot prove renormalizability.
thus the task is threefold :
i) reveal a number of free renormalization constants corresponding to the free parameters
of the theory (121).
ii) satisfy a subset of the sti for the relevant parts by choosing appropriate r.c. for l0,0
(125, 127). this subset has to be chosen suciently large to get hold on the niteness
problem, with the help of the fe and afterwards also of the sti themselves.
iii) satisfy the remaining sti for the relevant parts by choosing the appropriate l-loop terms
in l0,0 (122, 123, 124). it is possible indeed to show that all remaining sti ((128, 129, 130)
and those mentioned after (131)) can be satised. these are far more than the constants
xed in iii). all this has to be done respecting the order of the inductive procedure.
if it were not possible to make ends meet (i.e. if either the subset in ii) is too small to prove
niteness, or the one in iii) is too small in order to satisfy all sti) we would face what is

5 l0,0 will include some well-behaved irrelevant terms (107, 108) linked to the particular nature of the

cuto (30) chosen.

called an anomaly.

our procedure is complicated by a technical point. the analysis of the relevant part of
the sti at  = 0 is much more complicated for l0,0 than for 0,0, the generating functional
of the one-particle irreducible functions. for l0,0 many more terms of the same loop order
may appear in a single sti. passing to one-particle irreducible objects achieves to a con-
siderable degree the disentangling of the l-loop renormalization parts in the inhomogeneous
linear equations of app.c. so app.c has indeed been written for the 0,0- and not for the
l0,0-functional. the price to pay is that we have to provide for the necessary machinery
for the -functional (ow equations (87), sti (82)) too, using the legendre transform (78,
79). this should not obscure the fact that all results of this paper are to be obtained from
l0,0.

this paper is organized as follows. in chapter 2 we introduce the classical action of the
model and x notations. in chapter 3 we introduce the concepts from fe theory and recall
the statements on renormalizability we need. as regards the general aspects on bounding
inductively solutions of the fe we tend to be short as long as the reasoning follows the lines of
previous papers. in chapter 4 we derive the vsti for the regularized theory in various forms,
comment on the adaptation of the renormalization results to the vertex functions, analyse
the above mentioned operator insertion and show how to make vanish its relevant parts step
by step on disposing of the freedom in choosing the renormalization conditions. this is the
key part of the paper. with the aid of the results from chapter 3 it permits to prove that
the sti are restored and thus solves the renormalization problem for spontaneously broken
su(2) yang-mills theory.

2 classical theory and tree approximation

we collect some basic properties of the classical euclidean su(2)- yang-mills-higgs model in
four dimensional euclidean spacetime, mainly to introduce the notation and the conventions.
we largely follow the textbook of faddeev and slavnov [fasl].

the action considered involves the real yang-mills eld {aa

}a=1,2,3 and the complex
scalar doublet {}=1,2. all bosonic elds appearing in this paper may be viewed as smooth
functions of (suciently) rapid fall-o. details do not matter in view of the fact that we do
not perform any nonperturbative analysis of path integrals. the action has the form

under local gauge transformations of the elds

the classical action sbrs in (9b) has the following properties

i) euclidean invariance: sbrs is an o(4)-scalar.

ii) rigid so(3)-isosymmetry: the elds {aa

isoscalar; sbrs is invariant under global so(3)-transformations.

iii) brs-invariance: introducing the classical composite elds

in these transformations  is a spacetime independent grassmann element that commutes
with the elds {aa
, h, ba} but anticommutes with the (anti-)ghosts {ca, ca}. to show the
brs-invariance of the total classical action (9) one rst observes that the composite classical
elds (13) are themselves invariant under the brs-transformations (14). moreover, we can
write (8) in the form

sgh = z dxca{a

 + ma}.

(15)

using these properties the brs-invariance of (9) is straightforward (if somewhat tedious) to
verify.

it is convenient to add to the classical action (9) source terms both for the elds and the

composite elds (13), dening

sc = sbrs +z dx{a

the sources a
, , a have dimension 2, ghost number -1 and are grassmann elements,
whereas a has dimension 2 and ghost number -2; the sources a and a have ghost number
+1 and -1, respectively, and are grassmann elements. the brs-transformation (14) of sc
can be written as

employing the brs-operator d, dened by

(observe that  anticommutes with , , too.)

for some purposes it will turn out convenient to regard the elds and functionals thereof

in momentum space. our conventions are

(19)

where mostly we will omit the hat on (p). from (19) we obtain

for functionals with operator insertions like e.g.

s(x)

:=

sc
(x)

we dene s(p)

:= z d4x eipx s(x)

(20)

(again in abusively shortened notation). for later use it will be convenient to introduce a
shortened collective notation for the elds, sources and propagators. as for the latter, we
will sometimes denote all propagators (12) collectively by c. furthermore we write

for the bosonic elds  = (aa

, h, ba) with corresponding sources j = (ja

, s, ba ) ,

for all elds  = ( , ca, ca) and for their sources k = (j , a, a) ,

and for the insertion sources  = (a

, , a, a) and  = (a

, , a) .

(21)
(22)

(23)

the quantization of the classical theory amounts to constructing a well-dened version of the
formal functional integral respresentation for the generating functional w of the connected
green functions such that these functions satisfy the system of sti. considering the formal
expression for the modied generating functional

exp

1
h

w = n z [da dh db dc dc] exp{

sc}

(24)

we observe that the quadratic part (10) appearing in sc constitutes a well-dened gaussian
measure6. in a formal loop expansion of the remaining part of the exponent the emerging
order h0, i.e. the tree approximation, is well-dened and satises

dw |h0 = 0 ,

(25)

which follows from (17) when using the invariance of the (formal) measure in (24) under
brs transformations. in the sequel we will inductively tackle all orders hl, l  in, of the
loop expansion.

6once we have introduced the regularization (30) the support of the measure consists of suciently

well-behaved functions.

10

3 flow equations: renormalizability without slavnov-

taylor identities

3.1 the flow equations for the su(2) yang-mills higgs model

the fe of wilsons renormalization group is obtained as a dierential equation w.r.t. the
ow parameter , which is the energy scale down to which the degrees of freedom have been
integrated out, starting from the uv region. we will consider the generating functional of
the connected amputated green functions (cag) which we denote as

l,0( , c, c)

(26)

with the following explanations: we have introduced an uv regularization7 0 to have a
well-dened starting point, so that

0    0 <  .

(27)

the functional l,0(, c, c) is to be viewed as a formal power series in h, since we are
studying the perturbative renormalization problem in the loop expansion. to be more precise
on its denition we write it as

l,0 =



x|n|=3

l,0

l=0,n +

hl



xl=1



x|n|=1

l,0

l,n

.

(28)

here the multiindex n denotes the number of eld variables of each species appearing:

n = {na, nh, nb, nc, nc },

|n| := na + nh + nb + nc + nc .

(29)

so for |n| = 4 we are e.g. regarding a four point function. (28) implies that, by denition,
at 0 loop order l,0 contains no contribution from the one- or two-point functions. with
this restriction it is the generating functional of the cag of the following theory:
i) the propagators are those from (12) including the regulating factor

,0(p2) =

0(p2)  (p2)

0(0)

with (p2) = e 1

6 [(p2+m2)(p2+m2)(p2+m 2)] .

(30)

7furthermore we should restrict the theory to a nite volume v as long as eld independent vacuum
terms are generated by the ow, which diverge in innite volume by translation invariance. we do not make
this explicit here and refer the interested reader to previous work [kksa, kk3].

11

in the sequel this choice of the cuto function turns out to be technically convenient8. besides
being explicit it permits to verify easily the following bounds on the regularized propagators

here and in the following p denotes (each time it appears possibly a new) polynomial with
nonnegative coecients. these as well as the constant c depend on , m, m, |w|, but not
on p, , 0.
ii) the vertices are to be taken from our starting bare action (interaction lagrangian inclu-
ding counter terms)

l0 := l0,0 .

(32)

in the case of an invariant regularization we would choose here sbrs from (9b), modied
by including counter terms of any order hl, l  1, of the same structure and by excluding
the 0-loop quadratic part.
in our case such a restricted choice would not allow to prove
restoration of the sti. therefore we will allow at rst for all counter terms permitted by the
unbroken global symmetries of the theory, i.e. o(4) and so(3)iso.

these terms will then become unique functions of the renormalization conditions chosen.
there are 37 such local terms of dimension  4, corresponding to those listed in appendix
a. at the tree level l = 0 we shall always consider the terms with |n| + |w|  4 to be given
by (11). we denote by

(2)4(|n|1)n

l,n (p1, . . . , p|n|1)

(33)

the n-point cag of loop order l involving the indicated number of (a, h, b, c, c) elds.
we will also write ~p for (p1, . . . , p|n|1) in the following. we stay somewhat unprecise about
the momentum assignment to the elds since this would unnecessarily blow up the notation.
we also omit vector and isovector indices. finally we will also use the shorthand

w :=

|n|1

yi=1

(

y=1



pi

)wi, with w = (wi,1, . . . , w|n|1,4), |w| =x wi, .

(34)

8there is of course a lot of arbitrariness in this choice. what is needed is a suciently well-behaved
function tending to 1 for   0, 0  , which is essentially supported for momenta between  and 0.
the verication of the restoration of the sti in ch.4 would be somewhat easier using a suitable regulating
function with compact support of the type (p) = k( p2+m2
), where k(x) = 1, x  1, k(x) = 0, x  2,
k monotonic and smooth. but the choice (30) allows to perform the analytic continuation to minkowski
space as shown in [kksc], and it has the advantage that ((p))1 is well-dened. avoiding its appearance
is possible, but sometimes needs detours.

furthermore the subscripts s, a indicate (anti)symmetrization according to the statistics of
the various elds, since we assume the l,0

to be (anti)symmetrized from the beginning.

3.2 renormalizability

the system of dierential fe (37) can be integrated inductively, using mixed boundary
conditions (b.c.) :
a1) at  = 0 the n point functions with |n| + |w| > 4, i.e. the irrelevant ones, are supposed
to be smooth functions of ~p, 0 obeying the bounds

|wl0,0

l,n

(~p)|  4|n||w|

0

p1(log

0
m

) p2(

|~p|
0

) ,

|n| + |w|  5 .

(38)

the standard case are b.c., where the r.h.s. of (38) vanishes. we need to be slightly more
general to compensate for eects of the cuto function 0,0, see ch.4, (107, 108).
a2) at  = 0 the cag with |n| + |w|  4, i.e.
the relevant ones, are xed, order by
order in h at the renormalization point, which we choose at ~p = 0 for simplicity. the

9i ,0 is the vacuum functional which strictly speaking exists only in nite volume. since it plays hardly
any role in the following, we do not discuss this issue here and refer to [kksa, kk3] for further comments.

13

renormalization conditions (r.c.) may be chosen weakly 0-dependent, we restrict to smooth
uniformly bounded functions of 0 converging for 0  . of course we always restrict to
b.c. respecting the global (euclidean and iso-)symmetries.
with the fe we can inductively obtain the following bounds on the cag l,0

:

l,n

proposition 1 :

|wl,0

l,n (~p)|  ( + m)4|n||w| p1(log

 + m

m

) p2(

|~p|

 + m

) .

(39)

the polynomials p1, p2 have nonnegative coecients depending on l, n, w, , m, m, but
not on ~p, , 0.

we do not present a proof of the proposition since the line of thought is the same as in
the references [kksa, kk3, kop] and restrict to few comments. it proceeds by induction
upwards in the number of loops and for given loop order upwards in |n| (in contrast to the
procedure employed when expanding in a coupling constant : there one proceeds downwards
in |n|. for given l, n we proceed downwards in |w|, starting from some arbitrary10 |wmax|  3.
thus we have to start at loop order l = 0 and from |n| = 3, since l,0
l=0 does not contain
contributions for |n|  2. (37) immediately gives

l,0

0,n (~p) = l0,0

0,n

(~p) ,

|n| = 3 ,

0,n

since the r.h.s. vanishes. thus the bound is satised. for |n| = 4, l = 0 we may also x the
b.c. at  = 0, if we want to read them o the action (11), since here the second term on
the r.h.s. of (37) contributes and leads to a one particle reducible dierence between l,0
0,n
and l0,0
. this digression of the rules a1), a2) is a pure matter of convenience however.
the inductive proof then proceeds by inserting the induction hypothesis on the r.h.s. of
the fe (which has already been bounded) and performing the momentum and -integrals,
starting from the respective b.c. and using the bound (31). an important point to note
is the following : which bounds for the l,0 can be obtained, depends only on the b.c.
imposed and on the propagators (and dimensionality). note nally that for the purpose of
renormalizability only the bound on l0,0 in the limit 0   is needed. the rest is of
technical nature. in the next chapter we want to make use of the following also somewhat
technical

corollary : for given l0 > 0 and n0, w0 with |n0| + |w0|  4 we assume that the b.c. on

10the minimal value of 3 is needed, because for the relevant terms the passage from the xed momentum,
at which the renormalization conditions are imposed, to any momentum is achieved by the schlomilch or
integrated taylor formula [kksa,pol]. for the two point function there thus appear up to three derivatives.
if one also wants to prove smoothness one has to admit for arbitrarily high |wmax|.

14

the cag wl,0
l,n , (|w|  |wmax| ), have been imposed in agreement with a1), a2) for l < l0
and arbitrary n, w ; and for l = l0 and |n| < |n0| and |w|  |w0|. suppose that we x the
b.c. for w0l,0

l0,n0 on the wrong side, i.e. at 0, such that it obeys the bound

|w0l0,0

l0,n0 (0)|  4|n0||w0|

0

then we also have

|w0l,0

l0,n0(0)|  4|n0||w0|

0

p(log(0/m)) .

p(log(0/m)) .

(40)

(41)

proof : due to our assumptions, the r.h.s. of the fe (37) is bounded by (39), since the
bounds on all terms preceding (l0, n0, w0) in the induction remain unchanged apart from
those with |w| > |w0|. those are not needed however because we only make a statement at
the renormalization point ~p = 0 and thus do not require a bound on the taylor remainder.
the deterioration of the bound then stems from both the b.c. contribution (40) and from
the fact that the r.h.s. of the fe has to be integrated from 0 to  (instead of integrating
from 0 to ), i.e. from the wrong side. this gives the bound

|w0l,0

l0,n0(0)|  4|n0||w0|

0

p1(log(0/m)) + |z 0



d 4|n0||w0|1 p2(log(/m))|

 4|n0||w0|

0

p3(log(0/m)) .

note that the bound does not improve, if we set the b.c. for w0l0,0
we remark that statements similar to that of the corollary could also be extended to general
external momenta, they are not needed however. in response to the remarks made before
one may ask oneself whether the previous bounds (39) may be improved, if the b.c. are in
some sense smaller. this is indeed the case. regard e.g. the cag containing an odd number
of scalar elds, i.e. nh + nb  2in  1. then the following improved bounds hold :

l0,n0 (0) equal to zero.

|wl,0

l,n (~p)|  ( + m)3|n||w| p1(log

 + m

m

) p2(

|~p|

 + m

) .

(42)

the main reason why we may expect an improvement of power counting for those terms in
our theory is that, as can be seen in app.a , at l = 0 the terms in question are all proportional
to a mass factor. since we will not need such sharpened statements we do not give a proof
of (42) here. as usual the bound on the green functions should be complemented by a
convergence statement, since (39, 42) would still admit bounded but oscillating solutions11.
convergence follows from

11a possibility generally only envisaged by mathematical physicists since such oscillations are counterin-

tuitive to any experience from calculations

(43)

as before the nonnegative coecients in the (new) polynomials pi may depend on l, n, w, ,
m, m, but not on ~p, , 0. for the proof, which follows the same inductive scheme, we
refer again to the earlier references [kksa, kk3, kop].

3.3 bounds on green functions with operator insertions

the problem of renormalizing green functions with operator insertions has been studied
quite generally in [kk3, kk4]. again we state the propositions needed for su(2) yang-
mills theory without proofs, restricting to remarks on the (minor) modications needed. we
have to deal with two kinds of operator insertions here. the rst are the brs insertions
(13a)-(13d). these are dened as operator insertions of dimension 2, ghost number one
for (13a)-(13c) and ghost number 2 for (13d), which transform as vector-isovector, scalar-
isoscalar, scalar-isovector and scalar-isovector respectively. by the general renormalization
theory we thus have to allow for all counter terms of dimension  2 and of the same symmetry
properties. in the bare action the insertions take the form

1 ca(x) + r0

2 g arbar

(x) cb(x),

(x) = r0
a

(x) = r0
3

1

g ba(x)ca(x),

a(x) = r0

g h(x) ca(x) + r0
6

g arbbr(x) cb(x),

where we demand

g apqcp(x)cq(x) ,

r0

i = 1 + o(h) ,

(44a)

(44b)

(44c)

(44d)

(45)

i.e. the counter terms are again viewed as formal power series in h, and we of course assume
the insertions to agree with (13a-13d) at the tree level.

the following remark might be helpful, as regards the transformation (14e) of the anti-
ghost : we do not introduce constants r0
11, corresponding to the terms of dimension
 2 with the same symmetry properties (besides the ones in (14e) these are h ba and abccbcc).
the claim implicit (not only here, but throughout the literature) and veried in ch.4 is then
that it is possible to obtain a nite renormalized theory12 satisfying the sti, by xing these

8, . . . , r0

12this is related to the fact that (14e) is linear in .

16

constants at  = 0, i.e. on the wrong side ; in fact setting r0
11 = 0.
in the more general case one would have to admit arbitrary values for these four constants
and to introduce another source for the respective composite operator. the (violated) sti
(see below (75, 82, 98)) would then take a more symmetric form, the terms involving aa
, ba
being replaced by another one of the form hca, d lai.

9 = 1, r0

10, r0

the insertions may be generated by the respective sources as in (16), we set

l0,0



and also

= z dx {a

(x)a

(x) + (x)(x) + a(x)a(x) + a(x)a(x)} ,

l0,0 = l0,0 + l0,0



.

(46)

(47)

we again get a wilson fe (cf. (35)) for l,0 generating the cag with operator insertions13

e 1

h ( l,0 + i ,0 ) = eh(,0) e 1

h

restricting our attention to cag with one insertion, e.g.

l,0

(x) :=

 l,0
(x)

|=0

l0 ,0 .

(48)

(49)

(similarly for the other insertions) we obtain by deriving (48) w.r.t.  a linear fe for l,0
(x) .
writing similarly as in(33)

(2)4(|n|1)n

(p)l,0

(q);l|0 = (q + p1 + . . . + p|n|) l,0

(q);l,n(p1, . . . , p|n|1)

(50)

we obtain the dierential fe for cag with one insertion

w l,0

(q);l,n(~p) = xn,|n|=|n|+2

cnzk

(c ,0(k)) wl,0

(q);l1,n(~p, k, k)

l2,n2(p, . . . , p|n|1)#s,a

the notation being that of (37). since ghost and antighost in (36) do not appear symmetri-
cally, the c (c)-derivative appears once in n1 (n2) and once in n2 (n1). in the following we
denote for shortness by (q) any of the sources a
(q), (q), a(q), a(q). obviously each of
the insertions leads to a fe as (51). in the derivation of (51) no use is made of the specic

13we will only regard insertions with nonvanishing ghost number. therefore the vacuum functional i equals
i, since there are no vacuum diagrams with nonvanishing ghost number, due to ghost number conservation
under the ow. thus we will always write i subsequently.

17

kind of insertion considered. thus even more generally we replace (q) by (q) when talking
of an insertion of dimension d (instead of 2). this is because we also want to cover the
cag with one insertion of dimension 5 describing the brs violating terms of the regularized
theory. this insertion is analysed in ch.4.1. the particular kind of insertion chosen only
comes into play when considering the b.c., which are xed as follows :
b1) at  = 0 the n point functions wl,0
are supposed to obey the bounds (cf. a1, (38))

(q);l,n with |n| + |w| > d, i.e. the irrelevant ones,

|wl0,0

(q);l,n(~p)|  d|n||w|

0

p1(log

0
m

) p2(

|~p|
0

) ,

|n| + |w| > d .

(52)

b2) at  = 0 the cag with |n| + |w|  d, i.e. the relevant ones, are xed, order by order
in h at the renormalization point ~p = 0, with the same restrictions as in a2).
again (51) lends itself to an inductive scheme through which we may prove the renormal-
izability of the cag with insertion. for the l,0
(q);l,n there are seven free r.c. which x the
seven parameters r0
from (67) we
have to x 53 r.c. corresponding to the list in app.c. under these conditions our inductive
scheme may now also be employed to prove boundedness and convergence of inserted green
functions.

(53)

(54)

(q);l,n, we need a stronger result for the brs violating insertions l,0

whereas the bounds from proposition 3 are sucient for our purposes as regards the func-
tions l,0
(q);l,n, which we
can achieve on imposing further restrictions on the b.c. it is important in this respect that
the fe for the inserted cag is linear. this implies e.g. that multiplying all cag with a
- independent factor gives a new solution. if we want to show that the cag l,0
(q);l,n from
ch.4.1 vanish in the limit 0  , the strategy is thus to reveal a negative power of 0,
which can be factorized from the cag l,0
(q);l,n. it is quite conceivably a sucient condition
for achieving this, to require that all r.c. be bounded by a negative power of 0. the main
issue of ch.4 will be to prove that there exist r.c. on the cag such that the inserted cag
describing brs violation obey such suppressed r.c. once this is accomplished we can rely
on the following proposition for the restoration of brs invariance :

proposition 4: replace the statements from b2) on the renormalization conditions by

18

b3) at  = 0 the l0,0
functions of 0 bounded by

(q);l,n with |n| + |w|  d are xed at order hl and ~p = 0 to be smooth

1
0

p(log(0/m)) .

(55)

(56)

then we have the bound

|wl,0

(q);l,n(~p)| 

1
0

( + m)d+1|n||w| p1(log(0/m)) p2(

|~p|

 + m

) .

again we do not give a proof, but refer to our previous remarks, to [kk3] and in particular
to prop.7 in the paper on qed [kk2], where similar results were obtained in the more
complicated situation of a massless theory. proposition 4 obviously shows that the cag
l,0
(q);l,n vanish for 0  . we remark that in ch.4 we will arrange for r.c. such that the
bound (55) can be set to 0. this does not improve (56), because of the nonvanishing b.c.
for the irrelevant terms (see b1), (52) above).

4 restoration of the slavnov-taylor identities

4.1 violated slavnov-taylor identities for connected and proper

green functions

once the physical free parameters of the theory, i.e. g, , m and the gauge xing pa-
rameter  14 have been xed, the yang-mills-higgs theory should be uniquely determined
up to normalizations of the elds. the standard tool to enforce this uniqueness are the
slavnov-taylor-identities. whereas their role is twofold in renormalization procedures based
on invariant regularization schemes - apart from assuring uniqueness and physical gauge
invariance, they also serve as a technical tool to show inductively that the theory can be
renormalized without introducing counter terms not present in the bare action - we only have
to ensure their validity for the rst purpose. at an intermediate stage they are inevitably
violated by the regularization in momentum space, as gauge invariance is. we want to show
that they hold after removing the regularization, if we choose the renormalization conditions
properly. our starting point is the generating functional of the regularized green functions
at the physical value  = 0 of the ow parameter. remembering (21,22) we write

h, ki = z dx {x

 (x)j (x) + ca(x)a(x) + a(x)ca(x)} .

the brs-variation of the measure has mass dimension 5, since 0,0 just cancels its inverse
appearing in the inverted propagators in (63). this is convenient, and it is the basic reason
why we regularized the brs-transformation. requiring the invariance of the functional inte-
gral in (61) under (regularized) brs-transformations of the eld variables 15, (62) provides
us with the violated slavnov-taylor identities (vsti) :

0 != z d0() e 1

h l0 ,0 + 1

h h, ki {brs h, ki  brs (q0 + l0,0)} .

(64)

15these transformations of variables and consequently (64) can be given rigorous meaning for the regular-
ized gaussian integrals. arguing formally (64) amounts to the somewhat sloppy statement that the jacobian
of the brs-transformation equals 1 which in turn has rigorous meaning for the lattice regularization, see
e.g. [rei].

4.2 flow equations and renormalizability of vertex functions

in this section we shortly comment on ow equations for proper vertex functions. such
fe have been analysed previously in [kksc] for 4
4-theory, to prove analyticity statements
in minkowski space. they have been derived and applied before in the literature, see e.g.
[bam1, wet]. writing (70, 76, 78) with general  instead of  = 0 we may derive fe
similarly as in the previous chapter by deriving w.r.t. . deriving (76) we obtain

 w ,0(k, ) = p ,0(k)   l,0( , c, c) ,

and (78) then implies

 ,0 +  w ,0 = 0 .

(85)

(86)

combining both equations and using the fe derived from (48) for the functional l,0 we
obtain the fe for ,0 :

(p))1 (p) + zp

= h ((, 0)) l,0( , c, c) .

ca(p) (s,0(p))1ca(p)

(87)

the functional on the r.h.s. has to be viewed as depending on the (classical) elds  , c, c .
in momentum space the elds  , c, c are given in terms of those through

 (p) = (2)4 c ,0

corresponding to (84). the r.h.s of (87) is expressed in terms of  , c, c 17 using the
following relations (and the chain rule)

the inverted propagators appearing in (87, 88) remain only at the tree level, they cancel at
loop order  1.
considering rst the functional without insertions we may again inductively bound the
functions w,0
proceeding as in ch.3 upwards in l (note the factor of h on the r.h.s.),
for given l upwards in |n|, and for given l, |n| downwards in the number of momentum
derivatives. the induction starts from the tree order vertex functional

the tree level three and four point functions from the third term are given in app.a, the last
term is the tree level contribution to the irrelevant extension of l0 in (107, 108). imposing
b.c. analogous to those imposed on the cag from ch.3.2 in a1), a2) we may then derive
the bounds

proposition 5 :

|w,0

) p2(

|~p|

(90)

with the same comments as for proposition 1.

we again skip the proof. finally we note that to obtain the analogous renormalizability
statements for vertex functions with one insertion the fe (87) has to be derived w.r.t. the
corresponding source. again a fe linear in terms of the inserted vertex functions, but
involving also the noninserted ones, emerges. its solutions are bounded in the same way as
the corresponding cag from ch.3.

since the analysis of the sti is more transparent in terms of the vertex functions, the
renormalization conditions will be imposed on those. we may then directly infer the nite-
ness of the theory from the results of this section. we could also calculate from the b.c. on
the vertex functions those for the cag, which then also satisfy a1),a2) and conclude on
the niteness by ch.3, so that we might have skipped this section altogether, paying instead
more attention on how to calculate b.c. on l from those for  and vice versa. generally
speaking it seems to us that fe for vertex functions are useful in their own right. never-
theless the cag should perhaps be viewed as the primary objects of interest, since the

24

fe for them takes a closed functional form. this closed form is of fundamental importance
for the analysis of the linear relations among the sti and thus crucial for the proof of the
theorem and in particular lemma 2 below.

4.3 violated slavnov-taylor identities for the bare functional l0

in this section we use again the abbreviations

 = (0, 0) , l = l0,0, l = l0,0, l0 = l0,0, l0 = l0,0, l0

1 = l0,0

.

(91)

our starting point are the vsti (75). by commuting the functional dierential operator
appearing on the rhs of (75) with the renormalization group ow we will obtain the vsti
in terms of l0. we introduce some further abbreviations:

now we can write (75) in the form

it turns out that it plays -unexpectedly- a

4.4 choice of renormalization conditions and restoration of the

slavnov-taylor-identities

we have derived the sti in the previous two subsections for all three functionals , l, l0.
in fact the l-functional is only needed as a connecting link between the other two. as we
mentioned before this threefold description will be required to recognize the linear interde-
pendences among the sti projected onto the relevant parts of the various functionals. for
this purpose we also need termwise equivalence relations among the relevant parts of  and
l0. these termwise equivalence relations are simplied, if we assume that the renormaliza-
tion conditions for the functionals  or l are chosen such that:

 :=



h(x)

|0 = 0 

l

h(x)

|0 = 0 .

(100)

the condition (100) on the absence of tadpoles, although probably not indispensable, sim-
plies the subsequent formulae, and it is not really a physical restriction, but rather one on
the parametrization of the theory. here and in the following we use the shorthand notation

wn

f |0

to denote the derivative of the functional f (which might be l or ) w.r.t. n elds , eval-
uated at   0, followed by removing the global -function and performing the derivatives
w. when we write

we set in addition all momenta to 0 afterwards, and

wn

f |0,0

wn

f |0,0,l

(101)

is the l-th order coecient in the loop expansion of the previous expression. we now state

lemma 1: under the assumption (100) we have:
if for given l, n, w and for all l, n, w with l < l and (n, w)  (n, w) or with l = l and
(n, w)  (n, w) we have wn

 1|0,0,l = 0, then18

wn

1|0,0,l = 0  wn

l1|0,0,l = 0 .

(102)

proof: (102) follows from (83, 84) on noting that all propagators are nite and nonvanishing
and that all possible factorizations appearing when we apply the chain rule in going from

18we use the set theoretic relations for the multiindices n, w though strictly speaking they are sequences.

the symbol  means by denition strict inclusion.

27

the l- to the -functions or vice versa vanish due to the conditions on the lower dimension
terms.
lemma 1 suggests that we satisfy the sti for the relevant terms proceeding upwards in the
number of elds and momentum derivatives. the subsequent comparison of the vsti for l
(75) and l0 (98) shows that we also should proceed upwards in the number of loops. before
proceeding to the termwise comparison it is instructive to note quite generally that from

l1 =

d
d

l|=0 and l0

1 =

d
d

l0

|=0

it follows similarly as in (97) that

l1 e 1

h (l+i) = ehl0

1 e 1

h l0

,

and from the (perturbative) invertibility of eh we then obtain the relation

l1 = 0  l0

1 = 0 .

(103)

(104)

(105)

our goal is to arrange for renormalization conditions such that the relevant terms in 1
vanish, proceeding inductively in the number of loops l. these relevant terms are listed
in app.c, (i  xxix). by the statements from ch.2 and 4.2 and app.c there are no
nonvanishing relevant terms in 1 and l0
1 at the tree level in the limit 0   (this limit
remains formal before we have stated how to renormalize the theory in agreement with the
sti). since in the relevant part of the vsti there are contributions stemming from  (106)
for nite 0 which might conspire to give nite contributions in the vsti when combining
with divergent terms, our strategy is to compensate for them by introducing irrelevant terms
in the bare action l0. in this respect it is important to note that the termwise identities
(i-xxix) take the same form for  and l0 apart from the crucial fact that
i) l0 contains only those irrelevant terms we are going to introduce explicitly,
and from the fact that
ii) there appear additional terms in (98) as compared to (82) which just replace those 0-loop
terms, excluded in l0 by its denition19, so that as a consequence the termwise identities
look as before (when ignoring the irrelevant terms).
we will shortly denote the relevant terms in l0 by adding a sub- or superscript 0 to the
corresponding term appearing in . in the same way we denote (i  xxix) written for l0
as (i 0  xxix 0). in a number of sti the irrelevant terms introduced in l0 below (107,
108) will make appearance, namely in iii, v, v ii, v iii. for those terms the sti for l0

19these terms contribute only when performing up to three eld derivatives.

28

are rewritten explicitly in app.c including these terms. we use similar notation as in app.a
and app.c, in particular the shorthand

 := 0,0(0) :=

d0,0(p2)

dp2

|p2=0 = 

m4 + (1 + )m2m 2

6
0

(106)

we have presented l0 directly in momentum space, where we perform the analysis of the
sti. the letter i was chosen to remind of irrelevant, and we listed all terms of the respective
eld content allowed by the global symmetries, which are of second order in the momenta.
the constants i . . . will be chosen as follows:

20 = 0 ,

.

these relations are written in terms of the linear combinations which appear in the respective
sti and are needed to verify them. by the general results of ch.3 and ch.4.2 the theory
stays nite when adding such irrelevant dimension 5 terms to the bare action, under
the condition that these terms can be bounded by 1
). if the relevant
terms appearing in (108) obey a1)(38), this bound is obvious from the fact that  = o(6
0 ).
after this modication of the bare action we may state our

0 p1(log(0/m)) p2( |~p|

0

induction hypothesis: for l  1 and all l  l  1
i) we assume that the theory to order l has been renormalized according to a1)(38) and
a2) for the  (or equivalently for the l) functional.
ii) furthermore we assume

wn

1|0,0,l = 0 , wn

l0

1|0,0,l = 0 ,

for (n, w) with |n| + |w|  5 .

(109)

20we remark that when working with a regulator as in footnote 7, we could spare the detour (107,108),

because then  would be zero.

29

iii) finally we assume that

for (n, w) with |n| + |w| > 5 . (110)

all these statements are fullled at the tree level by our assumptions on the tree level action.
the rest of this section is devoted to prove the

theorem: the induction hypothesis holds at loop order l.

proof : at loop order l we rst prove the crucial

lemma 2: for given (n, w) with |n| + |w|  5 under the assumptions (100, 109) and if

note that the restriction on the momenta avoids the production of disconnected terms by
momentum conservation. now remembering (100) and the fact that l does not contain
0-loop two point functions we can use the induction hypothesis (109) and (111) to conclude
that all contributions to (119) vanish apart from the term

after these preparations we present the renormalization conditions at l-loop order, lower
orders being already xed by induction. this means we x the 37 relevant terms of the theory

31

and the 7 normalization parameters ri appearing in the brs transformation at order hl 23:
a) we x  = 0 (100), and we choose freely in  the 8 terms24

trans , long ,

,

, ab, f bbh, r2, r3 .

(121)

this then xes uniquely the corresponding terms in l. in fact we could interchange r1 with
long, r4 with ab, and/or f aaa with r2 in (121). we made the previous choice since it
simplies the check of the sti.
this means that we may choose freely all eld normalizations with the exception of h25, one
global normalization for the brs-transformations and the two couplings through f aaa and
f bbh. our simplifying assumption  = 0 (100) is related to the freedom in choosing the
vacuum expectation value of the higgs eld.
b) we x in l0 the following relevant terms:

r0

6 = r0

7 = r0

2 , r0

5 =

(r0

this means that r0

by our free choice of r2, and by lower loop order constants xed before. similarly r0
5 is xed
through r0
2 at l loop order. remember again that, by the fe for 1pi functions, an l-
loop contribution depends only on lower loop order terms and the l-loop boundary condition
for the term in question.
c) all those r0-terms in l0 having no tree correspondence are chosen equal to zero (11 terms
to be read from app.a), i.e.

rhba
20

, . . . , rcccc

0 = 0 .

(123)

d) furthermore we x in l0 the following relevant terms

(124)

more precisely (124) should be understood as follows: the f -terms on the rhs in (124) will
be uniquely xed as functions of (a subset of) the ones xed previously in a)-c). then we
x each of the three terms on the lhs as a function of those on the rhs.

finally also the remaining 18 relevant constants will be uniquely xed as functions of the
previous ones in our sweep through the sti. since 17 relevant terms (those from b)-d)) are
xed on the wrong side, namely in l0, one may wonder, how we will get a nite theory in the

23we mostly leave out the index l of the loop order for readibility in the rest of this subsection.

end. the tool to achieve this will in fact again be the sti, once we know they are satised.
this is not unexpected from the traditional use made of the sti in renormalization proofs.
now we rst satisfy a subset of the sti (i-viii) containing only up to three eld derivatives
by choosing appropriately

m2[cc, r1] (ia), bb[cc, r4] (iia) , r1 (ib) , r4 (iib) , f aaa[  m2] (iiib) ,

we wrote in brackets the sti which is satised by the respective choice of a renormalization
constant and in square brackets the other relevant constants at loop order l , on which this
choice depends. in the square brackets we omitted the terms from (121), which are freely
chosen, and r1 and r4, which by (125) depend on such terms only. note however that ib
and iib cannot be solved for r1 and r4 depending only on such terms, before we know that
ia and iia hold. therefore we indicated the dependence on r1 and r4 in the rst two terms.
at this stage r1 and r4 can already be seen to be nite. all other terms, depending on
constants xed on the wrong side, might diverge with 0. we come back to the niteness
problem later and rst convince ourselves that the system (125) is consistent, i.e. solvable.
this is a problem only, if a term is present before and within square brackets at the same
time, when we successively replace each term within square brackets by those on which it
depends at l loop.26 checking the list we nd that this happens only for f cch, which, when
from (125), depends on itself. solving for f cch it appears with a coecient
substituting f hba
1/ +  m2(r4/r1). since we know that r1, r4 are nite, this coecient does not vanish
for 0 large.27 as a result we may replace f cch[f hba

, rhba

] by

1

1

2

f cch[rhba

2

] .

(126)

after this change one rapidly realizes the solvability of (125).

now we impose renormalization conditions for the remaining 6 relevant terms by satis-

fying the following relations among (i  xxix) for .

f bbbb (x) , f bbhh (xx) , f hhhh (xix) , f hhh (ix) , f aabb

26e.g. at l loop r6 depends on r2 only by (122), whereas f bba depends on r3, r2, f hba
27 is supposed to be nite, but    may be taken after 0  .

by (124).

33

the order is important for the rst four terms, for the last two it is arbitrary. again we wrote
in parentheses the relation which is satised by and which xes the respective renormalization
condition.

at this stage the 37 + 7 relevant parameters are completely xed. all the remaining
relations among the sti will now be veried for l0. since there are no dimension 3 terms
left, we start with the dimension 4 terms which have not yet been veried. iv 0
a is the only
relation left among (i 0  v iii 0): using (123) it takes the form

2m r0

4 f bba

0

+ g/2 r0

6 ab

0 + 1/ f ccb

0 = 0 .

(128)

from (125) we know v ia and v ib to be true. lemma 2 then implies v i 0
b to be
true as well. these relations together with (122, 123, 124) then allow to verify (128). now

a and v i 0

xi 0 , xii 0 , xiii 0
1

(129)

are the last relations of dimension  4 to be analysed. they follow directly from (122, 123,
124). by lemma 2 we pass from l0
therefore lemma 1 now tells us that all terms in 1 of dimension  5 vanish i they vanish
in l1, and lemma 2 tells us that all terms in l0
1 of dimension  5 vanish i they vanish in
l1.

(131)

we have not yet checked the following ve relations of dimension 5 involving three elds
only : iiia, v, v iid, v iiib, v iiic , which are the most delicate ones. they contain
terms multiplied by . for iiia this is true when inserting f aaa from iiib. we rst forget
about these corrections and at the same time about the modication of l0 by (107, 108)
and convince ourselves that the 5 sti are fullled in this case. to do so we use the following
relations

i 0
b , ii 0

b , iv 0

b , v ii 0
c .

(132)

34

first we can verify v 0 using (124, 122) and v ii 0
amounts to show that

using ii 0

follows directly from (122), and v iii 0
b and v 0, v iii 0
c
follows from (122). now we also take into account the correction terms : those relations
among (i 0  xxix 0) which are aected by l0
irr (107) are listed explicitly in app.c. on
inspection one realizes that the choice (108) exactly cancels all terms   in (i 0  xxix 0).
thus all sti are fullled in our theory, and item ii) of the induction hypothesis is satised
to loop order l. what remains to show is that the theory dened up to l-loop order is nite
for 0  . as we noted, apart from the 9 evidently nite constants in (121), niteness of
r1 and r4 can be inferred from (125). to proceed further it is important to note that all
irrelevant terms appearing in the sti apart from those in (107, 108) are a priori nite at
l-loop since they only depend on the renormalization conditions at order l  l  1. the next
step is then to convince oneself of the fact that (f aaa)0,0 has a nite limit for 0  .
as we see from iiib the niteness of f aaa follows, if we can show that  m2 has a nite
limit. from (122, 123, 124) it is evident that all relevant parameters xed on the wrong side
(at  = 0) satisfy the bound assumed in the corollary from ch.3.2. from this corollary
(adapted to the -functional) and the induction hypothesis we therefore conclude that m2
0 . this proves the niteness of f aaa.28 then
is bounded by 2

similarly as in (135) we may now conclude from v the niteness of f bba (v ) . next we
pass through the following niteness chain
f cca
m2(ia), and then we can establish niteness of f cch (v ia) , r5 (v iic or xv ib) .
finally it is easy to convince oneself of the niteness of the remaining constants
hh (v iia) ,
in regarding the previous series of niteness statements it is interesting to note that it is
rst extracted for the pure gauge sector and last for the terms involving the h eld.29 by
now all of the 44 relevant constants are known to be nite, and thus item i) of the induction
hypothesis to loop order l is veried.30 once i) ii) are veried, item iii) immediately follows
from the general bounds in ch.3.2 on noting that
a) from our choice of the bare action it is evident that wn
b) the irrelevant terms in l0
obey the required bound as a consequence of the previous niteness statements
c) all other irrelevant terms in l0
1 are generated by momentum derivatives acting on the
regulating factor 0,0(p), which automatically produces (more than) the required negative
powers of 0.

so the induction hypothesis holds to l-loop order. this ends the proof of the theorem.
once the theorem is proven, proposition 4 tells us that the sti hold in the limit 0  .

concluding remarks
we have presented a renormalization proof for spontaneously broken yang-mills theory based
on the wilson renormalization group. the renormalization conditions admissible in view of
the sti could be stated explicitly in (121) to (127).31 we tried to avoid any equivocality
as regards the analytical status of the statements we made, in particular for which values
of the cutos they hold. we did not make use of unregularized path integrals. we think
that the analytical aspect is generally somewhat neglected in the recent literature including
textbooks. we did not attempt at generality on the symmetry or group theoretical aspects,

29this is reminiscent of the fact that the radiative corrections in the scalar boson sector are more rapidly

divergent, namely quadratically, than all other ones.

30the smoothness assumption directly follows from the smoothness of the regulator and from the b.c.

which depend on 0 only through the regulator.

31using in particular (123) it should be possible to derive the antighost equation of motion often used in

textbooks [fasl], [zij].

36

which have been studied extensively in the literature, and restricted for simplicity to the
physically interesting su(2) case. we think it would be worth-while to extend the work
- with the same precision on the analytical status - to the physical consequences to be
drawn from the sti, in particular the gauge invariance of the s-matrix. further interesting
problems to be treated in this context are the renormalization of qcd and the analysis of
anomaly problems and of the action principle.

appendix a

here we consider the generating functional for the proper vertex functions

(a, h, b, c, c) =

xn=1

n + (n>4),

n counting the number of elds, and extract its relevant part, i.e. its local eld content with
mass dimension not greater than four. generally we will not underline the eld variable
symbols in the appendices, though of course all  functional arguments should be understood
as such. in app.a and app.b the regulators are not explicited, apart from the subsequent
comments on the two-point functions, where contributions arising for nite 0 are explicited.

 (p) = ipab(p2) .

besides the unregularized tree order there emerge 10 relevant parameters from the vari-
cc(0) and
ous self energies: m2, trans(0), long(0), hh(0), hh(0), bb(0), bb(0), cc(0),

ab(0), where we used the notation p(0)  (p2p)(0).

trans|l=0(0) =   m2 , long|l=0(0) =    m2 .

to clearly isolate the tree level cuto eects from the loop contributions we introduce the
notation

(0) = (0)  (0)|l=0 ,

(0) = (0)  (0)|l=0 .

(137)

3) three-point functions:
only the relevant part is given explicitly: r = o(h) denotes a relevant parameter which
vanishes in the tree order, otherwise a relevant parameter is denoted by f . moreover, we
indicate an irrelevant part by a symbol on, n  in, indicating that this part vanishes as an
n-th power of the momentum in the limit when all momenta tend to zero homogeneously.

appendix b

we also have to consider the vertex functions with operator insertions stemming from the
brs-transforms. these insertions have mass dimension  2.
only the respective relevant part of the four vertex functions with insertions is listed:

there appear 7 relevant parameters

ri = 1 + ri,

ri = o(h),

i = 1, ..., 7.

all other 2-point functions, and the higher ones, of course, are of irrelevant type.

appendix c

here we present the 53 conditions which result upon requiring that the functional 1, (83),
has a vanishing local part for (mass) dimensions smaller or equal to ve

1(a, h, b, c, c)|dim5

!
= 0.

into most of these conditions also irrelevant contributions enter which are not given explicitly
but are simply indicated by irr. to recognize the local origin, we keep the momentum
factors arising. the -distribution emerging from the functional derivatives and forcing the
sum of the corresponding momenta to zero is not written. relations explicitly rewritten for
l0 carry a zero in the numbering. in those, the irrelevant terms from (107,108) are the only
ones appearing and are written explicitly.

the sti for  are supposed to be written for the case  = 0, 0  . note that
they take dierent form for 0 <  and 0   only, if  appears, which is the case
in ib, iib, iiib, v, v iib, v iic, v iid, v iiib, v iiic . for the l0-functional we write for the
loop level two-point functions 0 instead of  and 0, 0 instead of ,

these 53 conditions are fullled in the (tree) order h0 for  = 0 and 0  . for nite 0
we have also to take into account the tree order irrelevant contribution from (107, 108) to
the classical action.
