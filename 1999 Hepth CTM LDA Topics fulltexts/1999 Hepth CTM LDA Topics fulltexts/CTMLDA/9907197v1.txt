abstract

we study classical solutions of a particular version of the modied skyrme

model in (3+1) dimensions. the model possesses skyrmion solutions as well as

stable domain walls that connect dierent vacua of the theory. we show that

there is an attractive interaction between skyrmions and domain walls. thus

skyrmions can be captured by the domain walls. we show also that, when the

mass term is of a special type, the model possesses bound states of skyrmions

and of the domain wall. they look like deformed 2-dimensional skyrmions

captured by the wall. the eld congurations of these solutions can inter-

preted as having come from the evolution of the 3-dimensional skyrmions

captured by the domain wall. for more conventional choices of the mass

term of the model in the model the attraction between the skyrmions and

the wall leads to the capture of the skyrmions which are then turned into

topological waves which spread out on the wall. we have observed, numer-

ically, such captures and the emission of the waves. we speculate that this

observation may be useful in the explanation of the problem of baryogenesis

and baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe.

i. introduction

the skyrme model in (3+1) dimensions, originally introduced by skyrme [1], has at-

tracted a lot of attention as a reasonable good eective theory for describing baryons

[2]. baryons in this theory are described by topologically nontrivial classical congura-

tions (skyrmions). recently there has been some discussion of the problem of the baryon-

antibaryon asymmetry of the universe. this problem may be related to the problem of

interaction between skyrmions (or baryons) and domain walls during the early stages of the

universe.

the interaction of particles with domain walls has become a subject of interest following

a seminal paper by voloshin [3]. a detailed analysis of the scattering of abelian gauge

particles on domain walls may be found in a paper by farrar et al [4]. the problem of the

chiral fermion determinant in the presence of a domain wall was discussed in [5]. it is also

worth mentioning that the expanding bubbles of a new phase during the electroweak phase

transition may be an additional source for the cp - violationg eects of the electroweak

baryogenesis, see, e.g. [6,7].

recent interest in the problem of the interaction of particles with domain walls was

generated by a paper of dvali et. al [8]. in this paper the authors consider the interaction

of monopoles with domain walls. they suggest that this interaction may help to solve the

problem of low density of monopoles in the universe. they conjecture that the domain walls

would sweep up all the monopoles which would then defuse along the domain walls.

very recently this conjectured interaction of monopoles with domain walls was supported

by numerical stimulations of monopole-domain wall collision processes as reported in [9].

the fact that extended objects, such as skyrmions, interact nontrivially with domain

walls had already been discussed in our previous paper [10]. in that paper we studied the

interaction of skyrmions with domain walls in a two-dimensional baby-skyrmion model [11].

in [10] we showed that domain walls can attract and absorb skyrmions. after its collision

with a domain wall the skyrmion splits into two parts which propagate (with the speed of

light) along the domain wall. each part of the former skyrmion looks like a wave packet

which carries one half of the topological charge of the skyrmion. that is why the compound

objects like skyrmions and monopoles can interact nontrivially with domain walls. this

2

interaction requires further careful study.

in this paper we concentrate our attention on the problem of the interaction of skyrmions

with domain walls in a realistic 3-dimensional case. to do this we consider the conventional

skyrme model [1,2] but with a slightly modied expression for the mass term. our modi-

cation is motivated by the existence of solutions in the form of domain walls. in fact, rst

we introduce the simplest modication which is then further altered by the introduction

of an additional parameter. the model is introduced and discussed in detail in the next

section. for our choice of the mass term it possesses solutions which correspond to both

skyrmions and domain walls. next we study the problem of their interaction. we demon-

strate that there exists a solution, which may be considered as a bound state of a skyrmion

and a domain wall. we also show that the skyrmions and the domain walls attract each

other. we have performed a series of numerical simulations studying this interaction. in our

simulations we have always found the attraction although the nal stage of the evolution

process(ie whether the topological waves on the wall spread out or oscillate) depends on the

details of the modied mass term of the model. in each case the skyrmions are captured,

resulting in the emission of topological waves. the waves spread out on the wall in the

model with the simplest version of the modied mass term, or oscillate when the mass term

is further modied to prevent this spreading.

ii. the model

to study the interaction between skyrmions and domain walls in (3+1) dimensions we

consider a model described by the lagrangian density

l = lkin + lsk + lmod

mass,

(1)

where lkin and lsk are the standard kinetic and skyrme terms for the eective chiral eld

theory [1,2] and so are given by:

lkin =

f 2

16

t r(uu +),

lsk =

1
32e2 t r[uu +, uu +]2.

3

(2)

(3)

here u is an su(2) 2  2 matrix, u = 0 + i~ ~ and 0 and ~ are real scalar elds, which

satisfy the constraint

0 + ~2 = 1.
2

(4)

the third term, the mass term, violates chiral symmetry and is very nonunique, as it is

determined only in the limit of small pion elds. in our case we use the following form of

the mass term:

lmod

mass =

1
64

m2

f 2

 t r[(u + u +  2)(u + u + + 2)].

(5)

our choice (5) of the mass term gives us two dierent absolute minima for the energy of

the eld conguration at constant u = 1 (vacua states of the theory). note that the more

usual mass term leads to the existence of only one vacuum state of the theory (at u = 1):

lmass =

1
8

m2

f 2

 t r(u + u +  2).

(6)

note also that when the eld conguration diers slightly from the vacuum u = 1, i.e.

|u  1|  1, the two mass terms (5) and (6) are very similar.

both the modied (5) and the standard (6) versions of the lagrangian possess solutions

of the skyrmion type. however, the modied version of the model possesses also solutions

in the form of domain walls. the explicit expression for this solution can be easily obtained
after a further change of variables from the (~, 0) eld variables. namely, we replace the
(~, 0) by (f, g, h) dened by

(~, 0) = (sin f sin g sin h, sin f sin g cos h, sin f cos g, cos f ),

(7)

where f = f (~r, t), g = g(~r, t) and h = h(~r, t), f  [0, ], g  [0, ], h  [0, 2] . note that the

constraint (4) is automatically satised. the lagrangian (1) , when written in terms of f, g

and h is given by:

l = f 2



8 {f 2

 + sin2 f g2

 + sin2 f sin2 g h2

 + k sin2 f [(fg)2  f 2

 g2



+ sin2 g ((fh)2  f 2

 h2

) + sin2 f sin2 g ((hg)2  g2

 h2

)]  2 m2

 v (f, g)},

(8)

where k = 2/f 2

 e2.

4

consider now the case when elds g and h are constant. in this case we get from (5) the

following equation of motion for the eld f :

f 
 +

m2

2

sin 2f = 0.

among solutions of this equation (9) there is the static soliton solution

fsol(x) = 2 arctan exp (m(x  x0)).

(9)

(10)

in the (3+1) dimensional space-time this solution looks like a domain wall which links

the two vacuum states u = 1 of the theory.

in terms of the angular variable f the skyrmion solution becomes:

u(~r) = cos fsk(r) + i~~n sin fsk(r),

(11)

where fsk is a skyrmion prole function [2] satisfying the boundary conditions fsk(0) = ,

fsk() = 0 and ~n = ~r/r. the skyrmion solutions are characterized by an integer valued

degree of the mapping of s3 (compactied r3 physical space) into s3 - isospace. the

analytical formula for this degree of mapping (ie the winding number), when written in

terms of the elds f , g and h, is

q = 6z sin2 f sin g ijk fi gj hkdx3,

(12)

where we have used latin indices to denote spatial variables.

iii. a topological soliton on the domain wall

as it was shown in our previous paper [10], a (2+1) - dimensional skyrme-like eld theory

possesses solutions which correspond to topological waves. they behave like massless wave

packets which carry the topological charge. it would be interesting to see whether analogous

solutions exist in a (3+1)-eld theory.

to answer this question let us seek solutions of the equation of motion for the lagrangian

(5) in the form of a generalized cylindrically symmetric hegehog ansatz:

f = f (t, x, ),

g = g(t, x, ),

h = n,

(13)

5

where n is integer and we have changed euclidean coordinates (x, y, z) to the cylindrical

ones (x, r, ),

(x, y, z)  (x,  cos ,  sin ).

(14)

it is interesting to note that h = n is compatible with the equations of motion (ie the

h equation is automatically satised). so we have to look at the remaining equations. in

terms of functions f and g the lagrangian becomes:

l = f 2



8 r {f 2

(16)

in (16) we have used an expression more general than (5) for the mass term. our new

mass term depends on both variables f and g. the purpose of this generalization will

become obvious soon. the equations of motion for functions f and g, which follow from the

lagrangian (16), are:

it is worth emphasising here, that setting h = n has lead to a serious simplication of

the problem. in fact, our choice of h corresponds to using one integral of motion n, whose

conservation reects the internal symmetry of the solutions of the theory (1)/. note that by

introducing our hegehog ansatz we have been able to reduce the problem to that of having

to solve only two coupled equations for functions f and g in (2+1) dimensions instead of

having to consider the coupled partial dierential equations for three functions f , g and h

in (3+1) dimensions.

note also that in our ansatz the topological charge becomes:

q = 12nz sin2 f sin g(fgx  fxg) dx d.

(18)

we note that this expression is nonzero only when n 6= 0. thus to check whether

the hegehog ansatz gives us a skyrmion solution we see that we have to nd solutions of

equations (18) with the boundary conditions:

f (, ) = 0, f (+, ) = ; g(x, 0) = , g(x, +) = 0.

(19)

these boundary conditions guarantee a nontrivial topological charge of the system. note

that there are no nontrivial solutions of (18) within the class of functions with separated

variables, i.e. of the form

f = f (x), g = g().

(20)

this can be easily veried by looking at the lagrangian (16), in which the term

 (fxg  fgx)2

clearly indicates that it is not possible to nd any nontrivial solutions of the form (20).

let us look next for the stationary solutions of eqs. (18). consider the expression for

the mass term v (f, g) of the form

v (f, g) =

1
2

sin2 f (1  m cos2 g),

(21)

where 0 <  < 1. using this form of v (f, g), and performing a numerical simulation,

we have managed to nd a solution of equations (18) with the boundary conditions (19).

7

this solution looks like a slightly deformed 2-dimensional (in ,  variables) skyrmion (or

hegehog) located on the domain wall near the origin x = 0. the picture of the elds f and g

as well as the energy density for this solution is shown in figure 1 using the r, x coordinates.

one sees clearly that it corresponds to a bound states of a skyrmion and a domain wall.

the topological charge of the conguration is 1.

the solution is stable with respect to the 3-dimensional (~r  ~r) scaling transformations

as well as with respect to 2-dimensional ones, (x, , )  (x, , ). notice that the stability

condition with respect to these 2-dimensional transformations is similar to the condition for

skyrmions in the baby-skyrmion model in (2+1) dimensions, where a mass term is needed

to guarantee their stability (see, e.g. [11] and references therein).

in the case when m  0 , i.e. for the case when

v (f, g) =

1
2

sin2 f

(22)

any initially formed eld conguration which carries a topological charge located on the

domain wall is unstable with respect to the scale transformations in the (, )-plane. this

is why any initially formed eld conguration in the case m = 0 looks like a wave packet,

which spreads along the domain wall. this shows that in the case of the lagrangian (1)

with the mass term given by (5) nontrivial topological congurations on the domain wall

manifest themselves as topological radial waves. thus the skyrmion, located outside the

domain wall, when captured, is absorbed by the domain wall. a necessary condition for this

capture process is an attraction between the skyrmion and the domain wall.

iv. attraction between skyrmions and domain walls

in this section we show that skyrmions can be absorbed by a domain wall and form

eld congurations described in the previous section. to demonstrate this we have per-

formed numerical simulations of the time evolution of various eld congurations describing

skyrmions and domain walls. in our work we used the lagrangian (1) written in terms of

three angular elds f , g and h. we were forced to consider this, a more general conguration

than (13), as for an isolated domain wall the eld h is constant but this is incompatible with

the hegehog ansatz which describes the skyrmion. thus, to study their interaction we need

8

to consider the most general elds. we see that the problem of determining the interaction

of skyrmions and domain walls is more complicated than the problem of looking for bound

states of skyrmions and domain walls.

first we have performed the numerical evolution of a skyrmion placed at a nite distance

from the domain wall in the rst modied model ( = 0). we have done this for various

relative orientations of the skyrmion with respect to the domain wall.

in eah case the

evolution was similar for every orientation that we tried: the skyrmion was attracted by the

wall to nally merge with it. the structure formed by this process was then dissipated by

radiating concentric waves on the wall. figure 2 shows the evolution of a cross section in the

x  y plane (the plane perpandicular to the wall) of the energy density for this process. one

sees that, after beeing absorbed, the skyrmion is transformed into a wave which happens to

be topologically non trivial.

next we have performed the same simulation when  = 0.3. again the skyrmion was

absorbed by the wall except that this time instead of being radiated along the wall, it formed

a bound state with the wall. in figure 3 we show the evolution of a cross section in the x  y

plane of the energy density for this process. this conguration caries one unit of topological

charge and is is very similar to the topological structure described in the previous section.

we then looked at the interaction between a 2-skyrmion conguration and the wall using

 = 0.3 again. as for the single skyrmion, the two skyrmions where attracted by the wall

and merged with it to form a static ring-like structure on the wall. in figure 4, we show the

cross section of the energy density in the x  y plane and in the y  z plane (on the wall)

after the structure had settled down.

v. summary and final comments

we have established the existence of bound states of skyrmions and domain walls. de-

pending on the form of the mass term in the theory this solution is either stable or unstable.

in the case of o(4)-symmetry broken down to o(3)  z2 this solution is unstable and its

evolution looks like an evolution of a wave packet on the domain wall which carries the topo-

logical charge. we have also shown that skyrmions can be absorbed by the domain wall and

that their eld conguration is transmuted into topological waves on the wall. considering

9

the topological charge as the baryonic charge, this picture corresponds to the absorption of

baryons by the domain walls. note that, because of the dierent vacua to the left and to

the right of the domain wall, skyrmions and antiskyrmions (or baryons and antibaryons)

behave dierently. we end with the speculation that these arguments, ie the separation of

skyrmions and antiskyrmions by the domain wall and the observation of the absorbtion of

skyrmions by the walls may be relevant to the discussion of the observed baryon-antibaryon

asymmetry of the universe.
