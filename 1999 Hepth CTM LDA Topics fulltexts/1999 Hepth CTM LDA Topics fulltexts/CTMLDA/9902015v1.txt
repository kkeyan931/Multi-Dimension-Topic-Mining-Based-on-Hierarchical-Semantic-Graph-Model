abstract

for two decades it was believed that chiral symmetries cannot be
realized in lattice eld theory but this has changed now. highlights
of these new developments will be presented with emphasis on the
mathematical structure of the so called overlap.

1 introduction

up to energies e, tested in present days most powerful accelerators, one nds that
nature can be accurately described by a standard model, a chiral gauge theory
with a small non-vanishing short-distance cuto 1
 of unknown form but known
magnitude. accurate predictions are possible, despite ignorance about short dis-
tances, because the theory is renormalizable. to accuracy e
  1012 the inuence
of the short distance structure can be entirely absorbed in a few measurable pa-
rameters the chiral gauge theory depends on. future experiments will increase e,
and possibly change the standard model. very likely, the model will just evolve into
another chiral gauge theory, maybe supersymmetric.

renormalizability is rigorously established order by order in perturbation the-
ory (a certain asymptotic expansions of the theory), but is more dicult to prove
for the theory as a whole. mainly because the theory is chiral, renormalizability
outside perturbation theory is problematic.

although not established with full mathematical rigor, the accepted view is
that any theory is renormalizable outside perturbation theory if one can replace
its true short distance structure by a discretization obeying certain general restric-
tions. when the discretization preserves enough of the symmetries one extracts
physical information by going to a continuum limit where short distance details

of the construction become irrelevant. it is relatively easy to discretize vectorial
gauge theories, but chiral gauge theories pose new diculties. there, perturbative
renormalizability hinges on a delicate cancelation (of anomalies) and it is dicult
to incorporate this cancelation at a fundamental level in lattice formulations. until
quite recently, because of several no go theorems, it was suspected by some that
chiral gauge theories may not be renormalizable outside perturbation theory. this
belief has lost many subscribers by now.

a less severe, but related problem occurs even in the context of vectorial gauge
theories where almost exact global chiral symmetries (i.e. not gauged) are known
to hold. traditional lattice regularizations require an unnatural and cumbersome
ne tuning to achieve global chiral symmetries in the continuum limit. until recently
it was thought that one cannot preserve exact global chiral symmetries before the
continuum limit is taken.

one does not need to study the renormalizability of the complete gauge-matter
system in order to deal with the problem of chirality. unlike in renormalization
theory, the specic issues one needs to resolve when quantizing chiral fermions are
almost independent of the (even) dimensionality of the model. the problem of
quantizing chiral fermions in a xed gauge eld background can be formulated in
any even euclidean dimension.

renormalizability of the theory as a whole is an issue that can be separated
from the problem of chirality. the quantization of gauge-matter systems can be
split into two steps: in the rst only the fermions are quantized, while the gauge
eld background is kept xed. in the second, also the gauge elds are quantized.
we only need to worry about the rst step. this step, in isolation, has trivial
renormalization - and can be analyzed in any (even) dimension. the second step
typically requires euclidean dimension less than or equal to four.

if one so chooses one can deal with the quantization of the entire system as a
whole. but, in my opinion, this would be a bad idea. a crucial simplication is af-
forded by fermionic matter entering the action only bilinearly and this simplication
is only exploited fully in the two step approach.

2 the lattice and the overlap

our mathematical problem can be described as follows. start from a 2d dimen-
sional compact riemannian manifold m . it is the base space of a principal ber
bundle with structure group g. we also have an associated spin bundle and the
dirac operator d acting on its sections. the spin bundle can be decomposed into
its chiral components and there are two weyl (wl,r) operators connecting corre-
sponding sections. we shall simplify our discussion to at riemannian manifolds
with the topology of a 2d-dimensional torus, t 2d. also, to be specic, we shall
pick g = su (n). we replace the torus by a hypercubic nite lattice with sites
x. connections on the ber bundle are replaced by discrete collections of elemen-
tary parallel transporters u (x, y). parallel transport along a sequence of arcs (x, y)
in the graph associated with the lattice is implemented by an ordered product of
u (x, y) along the path. the individual parallel transporters are su (n) matrices. a
collection of link variables u makes up the gauge background. at each site of
the lattice we can perform an su (n) rotation on the local frame, inducing a gauge
transformation on the connection. a collection of connections related by all pos-
sible gauge transformations constitutes a gauge orbit. in the continuum limit,
physical degrees of freedom are associated only with orbits, not with individual
connections.

2 the lattice and the overlap

3

in the continuum, physical results require an integration over all orbits with
certain weight functions. the integrals are written as integrals over connections
but the integrands are picked gauge invariant, i.e. dependent only on the orbit.
this integration is carried out as part of step two in the construction program.
step one is required to provide two kinds of quantities, both determined by the
gauge background: the rst one is a function and plays the role of the determinant
of the weyl operator. the determinant is expected to be gauge invariant. the
other class of quantities contains the matrix elements of the inverse of the weyl
operator evaluated in a standard basis. these are the fermionic greens function
or propagators. the greens functions must transform by conjugation under
gauge transformations. one cannot pick arbitrarily independent denitions for the
determinant and the fermion greens functions: variations of the determinant under
small deformations of the gauge background have to obey natural expressions in
terms of the fermion greens functions.

on the lattice we would expect to replace the continuum operators by nite
matrices with a standard denition of nite dimensional inner products replacing the
continuum inner product in the hilbert space of sections. however, since the weyl
operators can have a nonzero analytical index which depends on the gauge eld, one
cannot decide in advance on the shape of the matrices. this observation, although
quite trivial, is relatively new and was crucial to the progress i am reporting on.

the disconnected space of connections we are familiar with in the continuum
is replaced by a product of su (n) group manifolds, one for each link. thus, the
parameter space of our matrices is now connected and cannot admit a smooth
denition of shape except when it is constant. this diculty faced by lattice
regularizations is well understood since the work of phillips and stone on lattice
topology; one needs to excise from the set of all lattice gauge backgrounds some
subset, preferably, but not necessarily, of zero measure. this leaves behind a more
complicated parameter space, cut up in disconnected pieces. on each piece the
shape of the matrix representing the weyl operators is xed. the shape is dened
by an integer determining the dierence between the number of rows and columns,
2k. the sum of the two, 2k (k  |k|), can and is kept xed, determined solely by
the lattice and n. each matrix is paired with a complementary one, with opposite
sign of k. the complementary matrix is associated with weyl fermions in the
conjugate representation, or equivalently, with fermions of opposite handedness.
the two matrices can be assembled together into a 2k  2k matrix (each side of
this matrix has a length equal to the sum of the numbers of rows and of columns
of either weyl matrix) representing dirac fermions. the bigger matrix has a xed
shape, independently of the gauge background. the main reason why vectorial
gauge theories are so much easier to dene is that the dirac operator can be replaced
by a matrix of xed shape. however, to preserve exact masslessness one needs to
preserve exact decoupling between left and right components. since the two weyl
blocks cannot have a xed shape any discretization preserving exact masslessness
of dirac fermions on the lattice has a dirac matrix which is not analytic in the link
parallel transporters.b

bthis has some interesting consequences: it goes without saying that the dirac matrix must
change by conjugation under gauge transformations. in turn, this means that the dirac matrix
connects two distinct sites by a sum over path ordered products of elementary link matrices. all
this goes through also for a structure group given by u (1). in this case, one can pick as an example
all parallel transporters in a xed direction as equal to each other, given by eip ,  = 1, 2, ..., 2d.
our discussion implies that the resulting reduced dirac matrix cannot be analytic on the torus
spanned by the ps. this implies that the dirac matrix cannot be sparse in site space.

the overlap provides a construction of matrices representing weyl opera-
tors. one starts with the easier problem of dening on the lattice a certain massive
dirac operator. one picks an appropriate hermitian operator hw which trans-
forms covariantly under lattice gauge transformations and represents massive dirac
fermions. there are no diculties because chiral symmetries are absent for massive
fermions. there is a large amount of latitude in choosing the structure of hw :
the single requirement is that hw be a lattice approximation to a massive dirac
operator with a negative and large mass term.c one excludes all lattice gauge eld
backgrounds for which hw has a nonzero kernel. (on the lattice, if one chose a neg-
ative mass term, this kernel will end up being non-empty for many backgrounds.)
this exclusion is gauge invariant; in other words gauge orbits are excluded in their
entirety. over the remaining space of gauge backgrounds one unambiguously splits
the nite vector space v, on which hw acts, into v+  v where v are the images

of v under 1(hw )
. (x) is the sign function. v also has a canonical split into
 induced by 2d+1  . the chirality operator  also splits the spin bundle
+  v 
v 
in the continuous case. there, it splits the dirac operator into weyl operators.
here, the lattice weyl operators are represented by overlap matrices between
the corresponding subspaces v 
 and v for the
other. the massless dirac operator is realized on the lattice as a combination of the

+ and v+ for one handedness and v 

two, and is given by do = 1+2d+1(hw )

version, ho = 2d+1do = 2d+1+(hw )

3 vectorial gauge theory and topology

the continuum massless dirac operator maps elements of v 
 (left/right compo-
nents) into elements of v 
. for this reason, if there are several copies (avors) of
massless dirac operators their left and right components can be complex-rotated
into each other independently without changing the determinants. a avor in-
dependent mass term would prohibit independent rotations, and only a vectorial
symmetry, with both rotations equal to each other, would be allowed. the technical
dierence between the massive and the massless dirac operators is that the latter
anticommutes with .

since  and  are hermitian and square to one, the operator v =  is unitary
and obeys v  = v . actually, if we only know that we have a unitary operator v
with the above property, we can dene  so that it be hermitian and square to one.
unlike the continuum dirac operator, the lattice overlap dirac operator do  1+v
2 ,
does not anticommute with .

all the important consequences of chiral symmetry are expressed in terms of
identities between products of matrix elements of the inverses of the dirac operator
(propagators). now, d1
1+v , is easily seen to

1+v + 1. the rst term, 1v

anticommute with . thus, the single violations of the chiral identities will occur
for identities involving diagonal elements of the inverses. there are many chiral
identities, and most do not involve diagonal elements of the inverses. actually, the
violations are immaterial for the continuum limit; in ordinary eld theory one always

con the lattice the actual distinction between a positive and negative mass is that the massive
lattice dirac operator with positive mass can be smoothly deformed to innite positive mass
without ever becoming singular. the negative mass operator does not admit such deformations.

expects singularities to arise when operators are multiplied at the same point.d in
the process of constructing the algebra of local operators in the continuum these
singularities need to be redened anyhow. thus, for anything that really matters,
chiral symmetry is preserved even with do.

that chiral symmetry would work on the lattice by allowing some local vio-
lations in the propagators was observed a long time ago by ginsparg and wilson
who formalized the requirement in a certain relation; however they did not pro-
duce an explicit example for an acceptable lattice dirac operator satisfying their
relation in arbitrary gauge backgrounds. they showed that a lattice action will
essentially have exact global chiral symmetry if the fermion matrix, dgw , obeyed
the requirements {5, d1
gw  r} = 0 ({.., ..} denotes the anticommutator), with

r = r, [5, r] = 0 and 5dgw hermitian, while r is a local operator, strongly

diagonally dominated in site space. dening d1

we nd that the most general solution of the ginsparg-wilson

gw = d1

requirements is d1
o + r  1, where do is an overlap dirac operator. ap-
parently, there is no advantage in picking an r dierent from the unit matrix, and
one often restricts dgw to do. the crux of the matter is to nd a unitary matrix
v for which  = v is hermitian such that the associated do be a faithful approxi-
mation to the massless continuum dirac operator. equivalently, one can look for a

hermitian  which squares to unity so that 1+

is an acceptable approximation to

when the gauge background is a connection on a nontrivial bundle over the
torus, the continuum dirac operator has exact zero modes because its weyl com-
ponents have a nontrivial analytic index. on the lattice the associated topo-
logical integer is 1
2 tr. one can prove that the associated zero modes exist as
follows. consider two orthonormal bases, {
j, j = 1, 2, ...2k} and

j = 

j|

j

{j|j = jj, j = 1, 2, ...2k}. obviously, the j can be chosen as also eigenvec-

tors of hw . exactly k of the 

js are unity. one has (

j, hoi) = (

j, i)


j +i

so

the rank of do(= hw ) is generically equal to 2k  |tr|, as expected. for generic
backgrounds the rank will not change under small but arbitrary deformations of the
connection.

it is easy to write down operators , v and their associated do, which simply do
not represent massless fermions and also are insensitive to topology, but nevertheless
obey the ginsparg-wilson relation.

4 propagators, the determinant bundle and anomalies

with the help of the operators  and  one can decompose the total space v into a
direct sum of orthogonal subspaces in two ways: v = v 
 with  = 1 on v 

or v = v+  v with  = 1 on v. the second decomposition is well dened only
for backgrounds where hw is invertible. let the associated orthogonal projectors
be p 
, p. let us think about the projectors as maps from v to the respective
subspaces. so, if bases are chosen, the projectors p 
 would be represented by

+  v

these propagators have ranks k  k.

the subspaces v are dened in a gauge invariant way: the subspaces do not
change along gauge orbits, so can be viewed as dened over the space of allowed
gauge connections modded out by gauge transformations. intuitively, w l measures
a distance between the spaces v 
+ and v+. if w l is a unit matrix (up to phases)
the spaces coincide.

the determinant has to be det w l. it can be nonzero only for zero topology,
since otherwise w l isnt square. although the map w l is completely determined
by the subspaces v 
+ and v+ (which are dened in a gauge invariant way), since
it connects two dierent spaces, there is no natural numerical determinant one can
associate to it. this mirrors the situation in continuum. what we really end up
with is a denition of a line bundle over the space of admissible gauge orbits, not a
function. the problematic part is a determinant bundle given by the collection of
all spaces v 
+ = v+  v+  . . . v+, where the number of factors is the dimension of
v+. in physics, a choice of basis in a v 
+ is a ground state in a second quantized
fermionic system with strictly bilinear interactions given by hw . it is crucial that
w l is constructed from hw which is c in the gauge background, even before
any gauge congurations have been excised. we only have a line bundle, so the
phase of the complex number det w l is still undened. the bundle base space is
the collection of gauge orbits, so gauge invariance is automatic but there may be no
smooth sections. in other words, while | det w l| = |det(p+p 
+)| is gauge invariant,

it is not yet sure that det w l can also be made gauge invariant smoothly in the
background gauge orbits. this smoothness is necessary for meaningful quantization.
to make progress we need to go back a step and work over the space of con-
nections rather than gauge orbits. this space is contractible in each topological
sector. we have the same bers as before. now we pick a section. the section
naturally produces a one form over base space. this one form can be viewed as a
connection in a u (1) bundle. in physics it is known as berrys connection. in our
case berrys connection corresponds to a known function of the gauge background
in the continuum, namely the dierence between the covariant anomaly and the
consistent anomaly. when this dierence is nonzero, any denition of a gauge
invariant chiral determinant becomes untenable in the continuum. on the lattice
it is suspected that, if berrys connection turned out to vanish, the section it came
from could be made gauge invariant. then we could take this section over the space
of gauge orbits and we would be done. if berrys connection vanished, berrys cur-
vature, an exact two-form, would also vanish. berrys curvature is however always
gauge invariant, it is a property of the collection of the vector spaces themselves,
independent of basis choices. therefore, berrys curvature two-form can be taken
over the space of gauge orbits, no matter what section we started with. generically,
it does not vanish. berrys curvature is entirely determined by hw . therefore,
the rst question to ask is whether one can deform hw in such a way that berrys
curvature vanishes. e here the latitude we allowed ourselves in the choice of hw

ethe two form is unchanged under hw  g(hw ) where the real continuous function g satises

gets exploited. by checking some examples it was found that there are cases where
no small deformation of hw can make berrys curvature vanish. the obstruction
shows up as follows: one picks a special two dimensional, non-contractible compact
submanifold in the space of gauge orbits and shows that the integral of berrys
two form over it gives a nonzero integer. these integers turn out to govern the
continuum anomalies of the chiral fermions one tries to discretize. this might be
the deepest geometrical feature of the overlap construction. for the rst time in
lattice eld theory one sees a purely geometrical role played by anomalies, directly
on nite lattices !

on the basis of these ndings i conjecture that if continuum anomalies cancel
it is possible to deform hw in such a way that the associated berry curvature van-
ishes. i also conjecture that if berrys curvature vanishes there is a smooth section
through the determinant bundle over the space of gauge orbits. assuming that
these conjectures are correct, there still remains the question whether an explicit
expression for hw and for the smooth sections can be written down. it seems that
even if constructive proofs are found the explicit formulae would be too complicated
to be usable in numerical work. nevertheless, i dont think numerical work is con-
demned to be impracticable, so long as the main goal is limited to approaching the
correct continuum limit.

i believe that, as far as physics goes, an explicit construction is not really
necessary. there are good reasons to believe that even if one integrated a weight
that was not exactly gauge invariant over all connections the result would still have
the correct continuum limit. the integration along the orbit can be viewed as an
averaging over the compact group of gauge transformations. the integration over
connections can be split into two stages, where in the rst one averages over gauge
orbits, producing a gauge invariant weight to be further integrated over orbits. even
if one used an hw for which berrys curvature did not vanish and a section in the
bundle over connections that was not gauge invariant the net result would have
the same continuum limit as one would get with a carefully chosen hw for which
berrys curvature does vanish. it suces that the actual hw is suciently close to
the nely adjusted one. the basis of this belief is a certain generalized universality
rst proposed by forster, nielsen and ninomiya on the basis of investigating some
toy models. indeed, it would be unnatural if the correct continuum limit depended
on whether one picks a complicated exact hw or just an approximation.

an interesting degenerate case holds for su (2), where a related issue, rst
pointed out by witten, arises for weyl fermions in pseudoreal representations. all
the spaces we dealt with can be taken over the reals, and one ends up with a z(2)
determinant bundle rather than a u (1) one. in this case one has no berry curvature,
just berry holonomies. explicit examples with nontrivial irremovable berry holon-
omy were constructed when anomalies are known to occur in the continuum. the
nontrivial holonomy was found by computer, using a well known relation between
degeneracies in hw and berry holonomy.

5 numerical methods

for vectorial theories any reasonable hw would work. but, one needs to make it
as sparse as possible if one wants a practical procedure. this is of direct interest in
qcd, a vectorial gauge theory describing strong interactions.

(g(x)) = (x). it might be convenient to search for the new hw in the form g(hw ) + , where
 is a small deformation.

5 numerical methods

8

in nature, the strong interactions become strong only at relatively low ener-
gies while all unknown physics resides at high energies. one might think that one
should not be in the way of the other. but, because of their strength, the strong
interactions mask numerically almost any other property of strongly interacting
particles. it is important to be able to calculate these masking factors in order
to separate out potentially interesting new physics from the measured quantities.
there is only one method based on rst principles to do the needed calculations.
this is the specialty of the subeld of numerical lattice qcd. as i already men-
tioned, in nature, there are almost exact global chiral symmetries and one needs to
reproduce them one way or another on the lattice. recent developments indicate
that this might be now doable much more elegantly than before.

in practice, one uses almost exclusively krylov space methods, since the matri-
ces hw are of the order of 106  106 and more. only their sparseness saves the day
and the numerical methods one can at all consider must use only matrix acting on
vector operations.

at the moment the methods of choice use some approximant for the sign func-
tion (x). one requires that numerical work proceed with relative eciency, while,
at the same time, the approximation be of reasonable quality. almost all methods
essentially use a rational polynomial approximant. it is unclear at present against
what criteria should one optimize the approximant n(x) to the sign function. a
nice coincidence is that in the area of control theory, applied mathematicians have
been faced with the need to deal with the (a) for matrices a (the roberts sign
function). what is special to our case is that our a is hermitian, huge, but sparse.
a possible representation is (x) = limn n(x) with

n(x) =

(1 + x)2n  (1  x)2n
(1 + x)2n + (1  x)2n =

x

the action of the sum over poles on a given vector can be computed by a slight
generalization of the conjugate gradient algorithm which uses the same krylov
space for all n inversions, and costs numerically not much more than a single in-
version. this is enough to study various properties of do, and also of its inverse.
since do needs to be inverted, we end up with a two stage nested invertor. i do not
know whether the errors in exact arithmetic and, moreover, the errors in real arith-
metic, of such a nested algorithm have ever been studied in the applied mathematics
literature.

to include the determinant in simulations seems at present too expensive nu-
merically if one must use the nested algorithm. but, there may be a way out, using
a continued fraction representation of the approximants n(x). we want the deter-
minant of 2ho =  + n(hw ) in the limit of large n. we add some extra elds, and
introduce a new bilinear action s0:

s0 = 5+  a11  1a1+ 1b11 +. . .+ m1 amm  mamm1 + mbmm
(2)
fields with bars are rows, without are columns, and in-between we have square

matrices. we write s0 = q with  =

therefore, one can implement the rational approximation by extending the ma-
trix size. one can use other continued fraction representations and other approxi-
mants; for example new approximants can be generated by exploiting (x) = (x)
for  > 0 or (x) = ( 1
x ) for x 6= 0. in some of the new continued fractions the
bi matrices may become polynomial in hw . in this case one needs to compensate
for the prefactor q det(bi) which now carries some dependence on gauge orbits.
the compensation is easily done stochastically, using pseudo-fermions. pseudo-
fermions are numerical integration variables that carry indices of the same kind as
carried by ordinary grassmannian fermions.

more developments in the area of algorithms as applied to the overlap are

expected as the subject is relatively young.

6 summary

the subject of chirality on the lattice seems to require a wide range of tools from
mathematics. at the one end one has algebraic topology, and at the other numerical
analysis. on the way one goes through principal bundles, index theorems, various
line bundles, to approximation theory, control theory, orthogonal polynomials, con-
tinued fractions, stochastic processes, and numerical linear algebra. lattice eld
theory could well use the help of professional mathematicians. i hope more will get
interested and involved.
