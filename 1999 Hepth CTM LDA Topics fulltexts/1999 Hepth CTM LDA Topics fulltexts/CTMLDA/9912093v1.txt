combinatoric explosion of renormalization tamed
by hopf algebra: 30-loop pade-borel resummation

it is easy to sum chain-free self-energy rainbows, to obtain contributions to
abstract
anomalous dimensions. it is also easy to resum rainbow-free self-energy chains. taming
the combinatoric explosion of all possible nestings and chainings of a primitive self-energy
divergence is a much more demanding problem. we solve it in terms of the coproduct
, antipode s, and grading operator y of the hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees.
the vital operator is s  y , with a star product eected by . we perform 30-loop pade-
borel resummation of 463 020 146 037 416 130 934 bphz subtractions in yukawa theory, at
spacetime dimension d = 4, and in a trivalent scalar theory, at d = 6, encountering residues
of s  y that involve primes with up to 60 digits. even with a very large yukawa coupling,
g = 30, the precision of resummation is remarkable; a 31-loop calculation suggests that it
is of order 108.

1 introduction

in this work we develop the hopf algebra of renormalization [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] to progress
beyond the rainbow [6, 7] and chain [8, 9] approximations for anomalous dimensions.

summing rainbows:

in d dimensions, the massless scalar one-loop integral with

propagators to the powers ,  is

g(, ; d) := g()g()g(d    );

g() := (d/2  )/()

now consider the interaction g, with a neutral scalar particle  coupled to a charged
scalar , in the critical dimension, dc = 6. to nd the anomalous eld dimension  of ,
in the rainbow approximation of [7], one solves the consistency condition

(1)

(2)

1 = ag(1, 1 + ; 6) =

a

(  1)(  2)(  3)

which ensures that the coupling a := g2/(4)dc/2 cancels the insertion of the anomalous
self energy. the perturbative solution of the resulting quartic is easily found:

rainbow =

resumming chains: at the other extreme, one may easily perform the borel re-
summation of chains of self-energy insertions, within a single rainbow. suppose that the
self energy p2(a, p2/2) is renormalized in the momentum scheme, and hence vanishes
at p2 = 2. the renormalized massless propagator is d = 1/(p2  p2). then (3) is the
rainbow approximation for / log(2) at p2 = 2. following the methods of [8], one
nds that the corresponding asymptotic series for chains is borel resummable:

chain = 6z

(4)

which diers from the rainbow approximation at 3 loops, with 206 in (3) coming from the
triple rainbow, while 170 in (4) comes from a chain of two self energies inside a third.

hopf algebra: we shall progress beyond the rainbow and chain approximations by
including all possible nestings and chainings of the one-loop self-energy divergence. in
other words, we consider the full hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees, established
in [1] and implemented in [4]. there are 4 notable features of this analysis.

1. we use the coproduct  to combine the antipode s and grading operator y in a

star product s  y whose residue delivers the contribution of each rooted tree.

2. we show that the rationality of rainbows [10] extends to the contribution of every

undecorated rooted tree, as had been inferred from examples in [11].

3. we conrm that a recent analysis [12] of dimensional regularization applies at both

dc = 4 and dc = 6, detecting poles of  functions that occur in even dimensions.

4. we obtain, to 30 loops, highly non-trivial alternating asymptotic series, which we

resum, to high precision, by combining pade [13] and borel [8, 9] methods.

2 hopf-algebra method

let t be an undecorated rooted tree, denoting the divergence structure of a feynman
diagram. then its coproduct is dened, recursively, by

(t) = t  e + id  b+((b(t)))

(5)

where e is the empty tree, evaluating to unity, id is the identity map, b removes the
root, giving a product of trees in general, and b+ is the inverse of b, combining products
by restoring a common root. the recursion terminates with (e) = e  e and develops a
highly non-trivial structure by the operation of the coproduct on products of trees

between each removal and restoration of a root. in sweedler notation, it takes the form

 (qktk) = qk(tk)

(6)

(t) = pka(1)

k  a(2)

k = t  e + e  t +p

ka(1)
k  a(2)

k

(7)

with single trees on the right and, in general, products on the left. the prime in the
second summation indicates the absence of the empty tree. the eld-theoretic role of the
coproduct is clear: on the left products of subdivergences are identied; on the right these
shrink to points. subtractions are eected by the antipode, dened by the recursion

s(t) = t p

ks(a(1)

k )a(2)

k

(8)

for a non-empty tree, with s(qk tk) = qk s(tk) for products and s(e) = e.

renormalization involves a twisted antipode, sr. let  denote the feynman map
that assigns a dimensionally regularized bare value (t) to the diagram whose divergence
structure is labelled by the tree t. then we apply the recursive denition [4]

sr(t) = r(cid:16)(t) +p

ksr(a(1)

k )(cid:17)
k )(a(2)

(9)

with a renormalization operator r that sets p2 = 2, in both the momentum and ms
schemes, and in the ms scheme selects only the poles in  := (dc  d)/2.

we can use the coproduct to combine operators. suppose that o1 and o2 operate on

trees and their products. then we dene the star product o1  o2 by

o1  o2(t) = pko1(a(1)

k )o2(a(2)
k )

(10)

with ordinary multiplication performed after o1 operates on the left and o2 on the right
of each term in the coproduct. by construction, s  id annihilates everything except the
empty tree, e. the presence of r makes sr   nite and non-trivial. in particular, the
renormalized green function is simply

whose evaluation was eciently encoded in [4], using a few lines of computer algebra.

r(t) = lim
0

sr  (t)

(11)

2

here we present a new  and vital  formula for eciently computing the contribution

of an undecorated tree to the anomalous dimension. it is simply

(t) = lim
0

(s  y (t))

(12)

where y is the grading operator, with y (t) = nt, for a tree with n nodes. in general, y
multiplies a product of trees by its total number of nodes. to see that this works, consider
the terms in (11), in the momentum scheme, before taking the limit   0. each term has
a momentum dependence (p2)n(ddc)/2, where n is the number of loops (and hence nodes)
of the tree on the right of the term in the sweedler sum. if we multiply by n, and then
let   0, we clearly obtain the derivative w.r.t. log(2/p2). setting p2 = 2 we obtain the
contribution to the anomalous dimension. thus r plays no role and we may replace sr(t)
by limrid sr(t) = (s(t)), where s is the canonical antipode. multiplication by n is
achieved by (y (t)) = n(t) on the right of the coproduct, where y acts only on single
trees. hence the abstract operator s  y delivers the precise combination of products
of trees whose bare evaluation as feynman diagrams is guaranteed to have merely a 1/
singularity, with residue equal to the contribution to the anomalous dimension. thus we
entirely separate the combinatorics from the analysis.

3 example

by way of example, we show how the 3-loop expansions of (3,4) result from (12). the
combinatorics are now clear. the analysis, at rst sight, seems to entail the detailed
properties of  functions. however, appearances can be misleading.

in general, a dimensionally regularized bare value for a n-loop diagram, corresponding

to the undecorated rooted tree t, is evaluated by the recursion [4]

(t) =

l(, n)

n yk

(bk)

(13)

where bk are the branches originating from the root of t. it terminates with (e) = 1. for
the scalar theory with dc = 6, the master function is

l(, ) =

a
(p2) g(1, 1 +   ; 6  2) = 

a

(p2)

(1  )(1 + )(2  )
(4    )(1 +   )

(14)

now the wonderful feature of (12) is that it depends only on the derivatives of l(, )
w.r.t.  at  = 0. this reects the fact that the anomalous dimension, unlike the green
function, is insensitive to the details of the regularization method. thus we may, with
huge savings in computation time, replace the master function by

l(0, ) =

a

(  1)(  2)(  3)

= xn0

gnn =

which establishes that the contribution of each rooted tree is rational. the residue of the
anomalous dimension operator s  y feels only the rational residues of  functions; it is
blind to the zeta-valued derivatives that contribute to the renormalized green function.

now that the analysis has been drastically simplied, we return to the combinatorics.
the double rainbow, t2, has coproduct (t2) = t2e+ et2 + t1t1 where t1 is the single
rainbow, with (t1) = t1 e + e t1. the antipodes are s(t1) = t1 and s(t2) = t2 + t2
1.
the star products are s  y (t1) = t1 and s  y (t2) = 2t2  t2
1. hence the contributions to
the anomalous dimensions are the residues of l(0, )/ and (l(0, 2)  l(0, ))l(0, )/2,
namely g0 = a/6 and g1g0 = 11a2/63.

following this simple example, the reader should nd it easy to determine the anoma-
lous dimension contributions of the two rooted trees at 3 loops. for t3, the triple rainbow
1g0 = (85 + 112)a3/65, in
graph, s  y delivers 3t3  3t1t2 + t3
agreement with (3). for the other diagram, t
3, with a double chain in a single rainbow,
0 = 2  85a3/65, in agreement with (4). the
it delivers 3t
borel resummation (4) of chains corresponds to the result n!gngn
0 for a chain of n self
energies, inside a single rainbow. writing the anomalous dimension contribution of the

(19)

4 results to 30 loops

at 4 loops, there are 5 undecorated wick contractions, corresponding to 4 rooted trees,
one of which has weight 2. for the scalar theory, at dc = 6, the tally is

g4 = 4890 + 4711 + 3595 + 3595 + 3450 = 20241 = 32  13  173

already this becomes tedious to compute by hand. fortunately, the recursions (5,8) of
the coproduct and antipode make it sublimely easy to automate the procedure (12).

at n loops, the number of relevant wick contractions is the catalan number cn1,

n+1(cid:16)2n

where cn := 1
tions. symmetries reduce these to rooted trees, with weights determined recursively

n(cid:17). at 30 loops, there are c29 = 1 002 242 216 651 368 contrac-
by w (t) = w(t)qk w (bk) where bk are the branches obtained by removing the root of
t. the symmetry factor of the root is w(t) = (pj nj)!/qj nj! where nj is the number
n nodes, is [14] pn>0 rnxn = xqn>0(1  xn)rn which expresses the fact that removal
of roots from all trees with n nodes produces all products of trees with a total of n  1
nodes. this gives r30 = 354 426 847 597. the number of terms produced by applying the
bphz procedure [15] to a single tree with n nodes is 2n.

of branches of type j. the generating formula for rn, the number of rooted trees with

from these enumerations, one nds  with some trepidation  that computation to

30 loops entails pn30 2nrn = 463 020 146 037 416 130 934 subtractions, each requiring 30

terms in its laurent expansion, with coecients involving integers of o(1060). brute
force would require processing of o(1024) bits of data, which is far beyond anything
contemplated by current computer science. the remedy is clear: recursion of coproduct
and antipode, to compute the residues of the anomalous dimension operator s  y .

each new coproduct or antipode refers to others with fewer loops. by storing these

we easily progressed to 13 loops, extending the sequence gn to

1, 11, 376, 20241, 1427156, 121639250, 12007003824, 1337583507153,

524366465815117346250, 89448728780073829991976

for egn, in the yukawa case, we obtained the 13-loop sequence

1, 1, 4, 27, 248, 2830, 38232, 593859, 10401712, 202601898

4342263000, 101551822350, 2573779506192

at this point, recursion of individual trees hit a ceiling imposed by memory limitations.

beyond 13 loops, we stored only the unique combination of terms that is needed
at higher loops, namely the momentum-scheme renormalized self energy. allocating
750 megabytes of main memory to reduce 3.7 [16], the time to reach 30 loops was 8 hours.
of these, more than 2 hours were spent on garbage collection, indicating the combina-
toric complexity. results for the scalar and yukawa theories are in tables 1 and 2. they
are highly non-trivial. factorization of g27 = 26  5  103  184892457645048836717

we combine pade-approximant [13] and borel-transformation [8, 9] methods. from (4)
n+1 = (2n + (2n  1)3n+1)n! with, for example,
we obtain the pure chain contribution gchain
gchain
= (8 + 7  81)  6 = 3450 appearing in (20) as the smallest contribution of the
5 wick contractions at 4 loops, while the pure rainbow contribution, 4711, is next to
largest. this is far removed from the situation at large n, where the pure rainbow term is
factorially smaller than the pure chain term. at large n, we combine cn1  4n1/n3

wick contractions, some of which are of order gchain
it
is thus dicult to anticipate the large-n behaviour of gn. we adopted an empirical
approach, nding that sn := 121ngn/(n + 2) varies little for n  [14, 30], as shown in
the nal column of table 1. in the yukawa case of table 2, we found little variation in
esn := 21n egn/(n + 1/2).

in the scalar case, at dc = 6, pade-borel resummation may be achieved by the ansatz

, while some are far smaller.

asymptotic series (16). we expect p (y) to have singularities only in the left half-plane. in
particular, a pole near y = 1 is expected, corresponding to the approximate constancy
of sn in table 1. we tted the rst 29 values of gn with a [14\14] pade approximant
p (y), nding a pole at y  0.994. the other 13 poles have y < 1. moreover there is
no zero with y > 0. the test-value g30 is reproduced to a precision of 5  1016.

suggested by table 2. here we put in by hand the suspected pole at y = 1. the [14\14]
approximant to ep (y) = 1 + o(y) then has all its 14 poles at y < 1 and no zero with
y > 0. the test-value eg30 is reproduced to a reassuring precision of 4  1017.

table 3 compares resummation of the full hopf results (16,17) with those from the far
more restrictive chain and rainbow subsets. to test the precision of resummations (21,22),
we used the star product (12) to perform the 2.6 1021 bphz subtractions that yield the
exact 31-loop coecients

g31 = 26  33  5  139  2957  22279  69318820356301  9602299922477621

no change in the nal digits of table 3 results from using these. at the prodigious yukawa
coupling g = 30, corresponding to a = (30/4)2  5.7, a [15\15] pade approximant
gives ehopf  1.85202761, diering by less than 1 part in 108 from the [14\14] result
ehopf  1.85202762. it appears that resummation of undecorated rooted trees is under

very good control, notwithstanding the combinatoric explosion apparent in (23,24).

6 conclusions

as stated in the introduction, we achieved 4 goals. first, we found the hopf-algebra
construct (12) that delivers undecorated contributions to anomalous dimensions. then
we found that these are rational, with the  functions of (14) contributing only their
residues, via (15). next, we exemplied the analysis of dimensional regularization in [12],
at two dierent critical dimensions, dc = 6 and dc = 4. the residues of a common set (1)
of  functions determine both results. finally, we obtained highly non-trivial results,
from all combinations of rainbows and chains, to 30 loops. a priori, we had no idea how
these would compare with the easily determined pure chain contributions. tables 1 and 2
suggest that at large n the full hopf-algebra results exceed pure chains by factors that
scale like n22n and n1/22n, respectively. pade approximation gave 15-digit agreement with
exact 30-loop results. in table 3, we compare the borel resummations (21,22) of the full
hopf algebra with the vastly simpler rainbow approximations (3,18) and the still rather
trivial chain approximations (4,19). even at the very large yukawa coupling g = 30 we
claim 8-digit precision. apart from large-nf approximations [13], we know of no other
large-coupling analysis of anomalous dimension contributions, at spacetime dimensions
d  4, that progresses beyond pure rainbows [6, 7] or pure chains [8, 9].

in conclusion: hopf algebra tames the combinatorics of renormalization, by disentan-
gling the iterative subtraction of primitive subdivergences from the analytical challenge
of evaluating dimensionally regularized bare values for feynman diagrams. in the present
case, where the combinatoric explosion is ferocious, while the analysis is routine, the au-
tomation of renormalization by hopf algebra is a joy. how else might one resum 2.61021
bphz subtractions at 31 loops and achieve 8-digit precision at very strong coupling?
