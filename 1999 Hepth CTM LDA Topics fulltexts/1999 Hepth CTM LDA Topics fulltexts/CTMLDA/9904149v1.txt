abstract

the ads/cft correspondence predicts a phase transition in wilson loop correla-
tors in the strong coupling n = 4, d = 4 sym theory which arises due to instability
of the classical string stretched between the loops. we study this transition in detail
by solving equations of motion for the string in the particular case of two circular
wilson loops. the transition is argued to be smoothened at nite t hooft coupling by
uctuations of the string world sheet and to be promoted to a sharp crossover. some
general comments about wilson loop correlators in gauge theories are made.

1 introduction

according to [1, 2], calculation of wilson loop correlators in d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric
su(n) yang-mills theory at large n and large t hooft coupling amounts in evaluation of the
classical string action in anti-de-sitter space. the string propagates in the bulk of ads5 s 5
with its ends attached to the wilson loops lying on the boundary. this prescription is a
consequence of the ads/cft correspondence [3, 4, 5]. gross and ooguri pointed out that
it implies a kind of phase transition in the correlation function of two wilson loops [6]. the
reason for the gross-ooguri phase transition is that the string action, the area of a minimal
surface bounded by the loops, generically has two competing saddle points. the minimal
surface can have a topology of annulus or can consist of two disconnected pieces spanning
individual loops. the annulus evidently has smaller area when the loops are closed enough
to one another. but the area of the annulus increases with separation between the loops and
eventually disconnected surface becomes energetically more favourable. at large distances,
the string behaves classically only in the vicinity of the loops and the connected correlator
is saturated by perturbative exchange of lightest supergravity modes between disconnected
pieces of the classical world sheet [6, 7]. a jump from one saddle point to the other should
lead to the phase transition in the wilson loop correlator considered as a function of the
separation.

two wilson loop correlators in the ads/cft correspondence were studied at large dis-
tances when they are saturated by supergraviton exchange [7]. to our knowledge, the con-
nected solution for the minimal surface has not yet been considered. the arguments of [6]
relied upon the pattern of topology change for the surface stretched between two concentric
circles in the at space, g. 1. for further references, we sketch these arguments here.

when the distance l between the circles is small, the minimal surface is the catenoid:

r(x) = rm cosh(x/rm). the area of the catenoid is given by

a = rml + r2

m sinh(cid:18) l

rm(cid:19) ,

where rm, the radius of its narrowest section, is determined by boundary conditions:

rm cosh(cid:18) l

2rm(cid:19) = r.

(1.1)

(1.2)

the left hand side of this equation, as a function of rm, has a minimum at some rm =
const  l, so for large enough l this equation ceases to have any solutions. at the critical
distance l, the connected minimal surface becomes unstable. yet before its area starts to
exceed the area of two discs, another minimal surface with the same boundary.

in this paper, we address the issue of how the gross-ooguri phase transition is aected
by the geometry of ads5 and by quantum corrections due to uctuations of the string world
sheet. the former problem is much simpler. the solution for two circular wilson loops is
found in sec. 2. the surface with the topology of annulus becomes unstable at certain value
of l. as a consequence, the wilson loop correlator in n = 4 sym undergoes the phase
transition at innite t hooft coupling.
it is still not
known how to calculate superstring amplitudes in ads5  s 5. presence of the background

the inuence of world-sheet uctuations is more dicult to estimate.

ramond-ramond ux compels one to use the green-schwarz formalism [8, 9, 10, 12, 11, 13],
the covariant quantisation of the superstring in which is notoriously complicated [14]. in
view of the diculties with passing to nite  in ads geometry, which is equivalent to nite
t hooft coupling on the sym side, we pursue the above at space example to study the
world-sheet uctuations in sec. 3. the string amplitude between two loops can be calculated
non-perturbatively in  in this case [15, 16].

2 two loop correlator

in the supergravity (strong coupling) limit, the wilson loop correlator is expressed in terms
of an area of the classical string world sheet stretched between the loops [1, 2]:

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

we take c1 and c2 to be concentric circles of radius r separated by distance l (g. 1). this
conguration suggests the use of the cylindric coordinates in r4. the ads5 metric is then

ds2 =

1

z2 (cid:16)dz2 + dt2 + dx2 + dr2 + r2d2(cid:17) .

(2.4)

the boundary of ads is at z = 0. we chose the units in which the radius of ads is unity
and the string tension is proportional to the yang-mills coupling:

 = (2g2

ymn)1/2.

2.1 minimal surface

using symmetries of the problem we take the following ansatz for the minimal surface:

t = 0,  = , r = r( ), x = x( ), z = z( ).

(2.5)

then the equations s/t = 0 and s/ = 0 are satised identically. the equations for r,
x, and z follow from the action

s = 2z d

r

z2 q(r)2 + (x)2 + (z)2.

the variation with respect to r and z yields:

r

z3 q(r)2 + (x)2 + (z)2 = 0.

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the equation which follows from the variation with respect to x can be integrated once to
give

where k is an integration constant.
if k = 0, the string does not propagate along the x
direction and sweeps out a surface with the disc topology. the minimal surface in ads5
bounding the single circular wilson loop was found in [17, 7]:

r2 + z2 = r2.

(2.10)

if k 6= 0 (without loss of generality we assume that k > 0), x is always positive and we
can choose x to be one of the coordinates on the string world sheet:  = x. with this gauge
choice, the equations of motions take the form:

r 
z +

(z)2 + (r)2 + 1 

r
k2z4 = 0,
2r2
k2z5 = 0,
r2
k2z4 = 0.

boundary conditions for these equations are

r(l/2) = r(l/2) = r,
z(l/2) = z(l/2) = 0.

in principle, it is necessary to regularise the problem by shifting the wilson loops from the
boundary of ads in order to get the solution with a nite area. strictly speaking, more
appropriate boundary conditions for z are z(l) = , but the solution itself is not singular
in the limit   0 and, since a regularisation does not inuence the critical behaviour, we
shall rst nd unregularised solution and shall return to the issue of regularisation later.
qualitative structure of the solution is clear from eqs. (2.11), (2.12). closed string emitted
by the wilson loop at x = l/2 falls into the interior of the ads space, then bounces back,
and is absorbed by the wilson loop at x = l/2. the radius of the string decreases till the
bouncing point and then starts to increase (g. 2), like in the at space.

it is possible to integrate equations (2.11)(2.13). adding rst two ones multiplied by r

and by u, respectively, to the third equation, we get:

or, taking into account boundary conditions:

(r2 + z2) + 2 = 0,

r2 + z2 + x2 = r2 +

l2
4  a2.

this equality suggests the substitution:

r = a2  x2 cos ,
z = a2  x2 sin .

the equation (2.13) considerably simplies in the new variables:

and should be continued to positive x by the symmetry (x) = (x).
the parameter k is xed by requirement of continuity of the solution at x = 0. since
r and z are even functions of x, so is (x). hence, the derivative (0) vanishes. equation
(2.20) then xes the value of  at x = 0:

0  (0) = arccos 4k2a2 + 1  1

substituting x = 0 in eq. (2.21), we get an equation for k:

the right hand side is the complete elliptic integral, since the upper bound of integration is
at the square root branching point: cos2 0  k2a2 sin4 0 = 0. the equations (2.18), (2.21),
and (2.23) express the solution for the minimal surface in terms of elliptic functions.

2.2 critical behaviour

the existence of the phase transition in the wilson loop correlator can be inferred from
eq. (2.23). the function f () turns to zero at  = 0 and at  = :

f ()   ln 
23
f () 
4(cid:17)
2(cid:16) 1

(  0),

(  ).

(2.25)

consequently, it has a maximum at some  = . at the same time, the right hand side
of equation (2.23) varies from zero to innity as the separation between loops increases.
continuity arguments show that the branch with larger ka should be chosen from the two of
the solutions of equation (2.23). the two branches meet at ka = . if l exceeds the critical
value

the equation (2.23) does not have any solutions and the minimal surface with the topology
of annulus ceases to exist. numerically,  = 0.58 and

l = 2r sinh f (),

l = 1.04r.

6

(2.26)

the connected minimal surface becomes unstable when wilson loops are separated by this
distance. in fact, the transition from the annulus to the disc topology is of the rst order.
the critical point is determined by the equality of the free energies in the two phases, the
areas of the disconnected and the connected minimal surfaces.

the area of regularised disconnected solution is [17, 7]

sdisc = 2 2r2 + 2



 2! =

4r
  4 + o().

(2.27)

the area of the connected surface also requires regularisation. shift in the boundary
conditions for z, z(l/2) =  instead of z(l/2) = 0, renders the area nite. the boundary
conditions for (x) change, accordingly. from (2.18) we nd:

(l/2) = arctan(cid:18) 

r(cid:19)

using equations of motion, we get for the regularised area:

(2.31)

the equations (2.1), (2.23), (2.24), (2.30), and (2.31) determine the correlator of two wilson
loops in the strong-coupling n = 4 sym theory.
the divergent part of the area is the same for the connected and the disconnected solu-
tions. its origin can be attributed to perimeter divergency of a wilson loop due to self-energy
contributions [17, 7]. the renormalised area is always negative. its short-distance asymp-
totics can be found with the help of eq. (2.25):

the area grows with separation between loops and at the point of the phase transition meets
the area of the disconnected surface. solving equations for the critical point numerically, we
nd:

lc = 0.91r.

(2.33)

in spite of evident dierences between the classical string propagation in ads5 and in
the at space, the qualitative pattern of the gross-ooguri phase transition appears to be
not much inuenced by geometry of the target space. in both cases, the transition is of the
rst order and takes place at l  r. we expect that an inuence of the string uctuations
on the phase transition is also universal, at least in some respects. this is our motivation to
study the free superstring propagator between two loops in the next section.

3 two loop amplitude in the free string theory

the equations (2.1)(2.3) are expected to be valid at innite t hooft coupling and to be
replaced by a full sum over random surfaces in ads5  s 5 with boundary conditions set by
wilson loops, when the coupling is nite. presently, uctuations of the string world sheet
in ads geometry can be accounted for only to the rst order in  [18, 19]. the superstring
amplitude in the at space is much easier to calculate. it is known exactly and provides a
possibility to trace qualitative changes brought in by non-perturbative  corrections.

the amplitude for the free type iib superstring to propagate between two concentric
circular loops is a particular case of the boundary state amplitude calculated for the bosonic
string in [15] and for nsr string in [16]. after gso projection, the amplitude takes the
form:

suppose that l2   and r2  , then s is large and the proper time integral (3.1)

figure 3: the superstring amplitude between two circular loops versus l2 at r2 = 20 (the
units are such that 2 = 1). the thick solid line is  lna. two other curves represent
approximations for the amplitude valid in dierent phases. the thin solid line is the area of
the catenoid with o(0) correction added. the line terminates at the point of instability,
l = l2
. the dashed line is 2r2  ln(supergraviton exchange). the estimate for the
crossover point based on matching of the classical actions in the two phases is lc  22 for
the chosen value of r. account of the supergraviton exchange and of the rst order in the
semiclassical expansion shift the crossover point by about 20%. the reason for numerically
large deviation from the classical estimate is that the rst order corrections are logarithmic
in l2.

the saddle point disappears at suciently large l, because eq. (3.3) has no solutions for
l > l. beyond the critical point, the main contribution to the integral comes from s  .
the action at s =  is 2r2, the area of two discs. at large distances, the amplitude is
saturated by an exchange of massless string modes:

a  const

96
l8 e r2/

.

(3.5)

the semiclassical amplitude has a discontinuous rst derivative in l at the point of the
transition between the two saddle points. the discontinuity persists to any nite order in
the  expansion. the integral (3.1), however, denes an analytic function of l. the phase
transition is thus replaced by a smooth crossover in the exact amplitude. the larger r2 is,
the sharper this crossover will be. the abrupt change in the amplitude is clearly seen in
g. 3 which displays the result of numerical integration of eq. (3.1) at r2 = 40. note
that retaining only massless string modes is a good approximation everywhere above the
transition, since l2 is much larger than , whereas below the transition all modes give
comparable contribution.

the conclusion from the above consideration is that the world-sheet uctuations smoothen
ymn)1/2 is suciently small, the

the gross-ooguri phase transition. however, if  = (2g2
transition should show up as a sharp crossover in the wilson loop correlator.

9

4 discussion

calculations carried out in the previous sections demonstrate that the wilson loop two point
function in n = 4 sym undergoes the rst order phase transition as the distance between
loops changes, if the t hooft coupling is innite. if the coupling is large but nite, tunnelling
between the saddle points of the string action smoothens the dependence of the correlator
on the distance and the phase transition is replaced by a sharp crossover. the transition
seems to be completely washed out in the weak coupling, perturbative regime.

in conclusion, we would like to comment on wilson loop correlation functions in asymp-
totically free, conning gauge theories, which are also believed to have some kind of ap-
proximate, or even exact string representation. at short distances, 1
qcd  l  r, the
wilson loop correlator should be dominated by an open string stretched between the loops.
this representation suggests that the large-radius limit of the correlator should determine
an interaction potential between probe static charges:

v (l) =  lim

r

lndw (c1)w (c2)econn

2r

.

(4.1)

the comparison of eq. (2.32) with the potential found in [1] shows that this relation is
satised by the two loop correlator calculated using the ads/cft correspondence.

at large distances between loops, a more appropriate picture is that of the closed string
exchange. it is not quite clear whether the open and the closed string regimes are separated
by the gross-ooguri crossover. general arguments seem to indicate that this is the case. if
geometric characteristics of the loops are large in the units of the string tension, a conning
string has a large action and hopefully can be described within the semiclassical approxima-
tion. the instability of the classical string world sheet will then lead to the phase transition
in the semiclassical amplitude. this kind of behaviour certainly holds for the free string.

however, the free string amplitude is rather loose substitute for wilson loop correlation
functions in a gauge theory, basically because of the lack of zig zag invariance [20, 21]. one
of the consequences of the violation of zig zag invariance is the hagedorn transition in the
h = 2 due to exponential growth
free string case: the amplitude (3.1) diverges at l2  l2
of the closed string density of states. such kind of divergency of correlation functions at
short distances is expected in quantum gravity [22], but not in gauge theories.
in fact,
intermediate states in the spectral representation for the wilson loop correlator,

dw (c1)w (c2)econn
c(e) = xn6=0

= z 

0

de c(e) e el,

(e  en)|h0|w (c)|ni|2 ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

which generically are glueballs, are expected to have exponentially growing spectrum. but
zig zag symmetry suppresses coupling of wilson loops to glueballs of very high spin, which
can be seen expanding the wilson loop in local operators [23]. spin 2n operators come with
coecients of order 1/n!. for example, the operator with a minimal number of derivatives
is

1
n!

tr (cid:18)i dxx f(x0)(cid:19)n

.

10

hence, wilson loop eectively couples only to states with spin j < j0, where j0 is propor-
tional to the area of the loop. as a result, the spectral density c(e) should have power-law
asymptotics. this property is essentially a consequence of the zig zag invariance, since the
latter requires the wilson loop of zero area to be the unit operator. this is not true for the
boundary states in (3.1), which couple to all string modes even at r = 0 [15, 16].

the modular transformation converts the hagedorn divergency of the amplitude to the
tachyon singularity in the open string channel [24]. again, the tachyon instability is not
expected to arise in gauge theories.
