abstract

we nd an innite dimensional free algebra which lives at large
n in any su(n)-invariant action or hamiltonian theory of bosonic
matrices. the natural basis of this algebra is a free-algebraic gen-
eralization of chebyshev polynomials and the dual basis is closely
related to the planar connected parts. this leads to a number of
free-algebraic forms of the master eld including an algebraic deriva-
tion of the gopakumar-gross form. for action theories, these forms
of the master eld immediately give a number of new free-algebraic
packagings of the planar schwinger-dyson equations.

1 introduction

recently [1], we have studied the algebras of phase-space master elds in
general matrix models, obtaining in particular a number of new free alge-
bras which generalize the cuntz algebra. among these generalizations, our
starting point in this paper is the set of interacting cuntz algebras 1
bm = 2am = fm() + im,

b
m = fm()  im,
n = emn

bmb

emn() = 2cmn()
(1.1a)
(1.1b)

b
m(e1)mnbn = 1 | 0ih0 |

bm | 0i = h0 | b

m = 0,

m, n = 1 . . . d

(1.1c)

(1.1d)

which occur at large n in general bosonic matrix models, and may also occur
in matrix models with fermions. the elds m and m are the master eld
and the reduced momenta respectively, and the operators fm and emn are
determined by the potential. the cuntz algebra is the special case of (1.1)
obtained in the case of matrix oscillators.

in the present paper, we will generalize these algebras in two directions.
first, we recall that the fth-time formulation (see for example ref. [2])
maps any euclidean action theory into a higher-dimensional theory 2 with a
hamiltonian formulation. this allows us to read ref. [1] as a unied free-
algebraic treatment of action and phase-space master elds (see sec. 2). the
unied formulation includes and extends haans [6] early free-algebraic for-
mulation of action master elds, and one sees in particular that the interact-
ing cuntz algebra (1.1) occurs in the same way for action and phase-space
master elds. the operators fm and emn of the algebra (1.1) are straight-
forward to compute explicitly for the action case.

the second direction is the main subject of this paper. for action and/or
phase-space master elds, the interacting cuntz algebra can be extended to
an innite dimensional free algebra (see secs. 3, 4, 5 and 6), whose structure,
especially in the action case, controls the large n theory. the annihilation
1certain powers of 2 are scaled out here relative to the operators a and c of ref. [1].
2in an evident parallel with the ads/cft correspondence [3-5], the fth-time formu-
lation also gives the large n action theory as a classical solution of the higher-dimensional
theory (see subsec. 2.1 and app. a)

1

operators of this algebra are dened as composites of the interacting cuntz
operators

bw = bw = bm1 . . . bmn,

w = m1 . . . mn,

[w] = n

b w = b w = bmn . . . bm1,

w = mn . . . m1,

[ w] = n

(1.2a)

(1.2b)

where w is any word, composed of letters mi, and [w] is the length of w.
when a word w is written as a subscript it is a label but when written as a
superscript it is to be read as an exponent, producing an ordered product, as
in (1.2a). the null word is 0, with [0] = 0 and b0 = 1. this word notation,
and the rule

ww = m1 . . . mnm

1 . . . m

n,

[ww] = [w] + [w]

(1.3)

will be followed uniformly below.

surprisingly, the composite annihilation operators (1.2) and the corre-
sponding creation operators turn out to be linear in the reduced momenta
m,

bmw = fmw() + imgw(),

mw = fmw()  ig w()m
b 

(1.4)

and this fact underlies the simple form of the innite dimensional free algebra
below. the operators gw and fw can be obtained in terms of fm and emn (see
sec.3), and gw, fw turn out to be free-algebraic generalizations of chebyshev
polynomials (see subsecs. 3.2 and 3.3).

the innite dimensional free algebra is then

bwbw = bww,

b 

w b 

w = b 

ww

b 
mw bnw = g wmbnw  g wbmnw

w gw + g wbw  g ww  g w | 0ih0 | gw
nw ) + emw;nw()

w,w,m,wb 

(bmwfw,w,n,w + f 

mw (e1)mnbnw = b 

b 
bmwb 

nw = xw

bw | 0i = w,0 | 0i,

h0 | b 

w = h0 | w,0

(1.5a)

(1.5b)

(1.5c)

(1.5d)

(1.5e)

where emw,nw() and the structure constants f will be given in sec. 6. the
interacting cuntz algebra (1.1) is a subalgebra of (1.5), and (1.5b) includes a
new relation for b
mbn. in the case of oscillators and/or free action theories,

2

the cuntz algebra itself is a subalgebra of the innite dimensional algebra
(see app. b).

the creation operators of this algebra provide us with a natural basis

b 
w | 0i = g w() | 0i

(1.6)

comprised of the gws themselves, and the dual basis, orthonormal to (1.6),
turns out to involve the planar connected parts xw in a very simple way.

this leads us to a number of forms of the master eld (see sec. 7), in-

cluding the basic form

and the dual basis form

m = xw

xmwgw()

(1.7)

m = 

m = bm(1 + x(b)),

bm = (e1)mnbn

(1.8)

where b and b satisfy a cuntz algebra and x(b) is the generating function
of planar connected parts. the dual basis form (1.8) is the hermitian coun-
terpart of the non-hermitian form obtained diagrammatically by gopakumar
and gross [7]. we also give the forms of the master eld in terms of the planar
correlators and the planar 1pi parts.

for action theories, these forms of the master eld immediately give a
number of new free-algebraic forms (see sec. 8) of the planar schwinger-
dyson equations, including, surprisingly, the basic form (1.7) itself and the
dual basis system

b

m + emn( b(1 + x)) bn = gm( b(1 + x))

(1.9)

both of which can be used for computation of the planar connected parts.
systems similar to (1.9) follow for the planar correlators and the planar
eective action, and, although they are packaged dierently, these systems
(including (1.9)) are closely related to the free-algebraic equations derived
diagrammatically in ref. [8].

we conclude that the interacting cuntz algebra (1.1) and the innite
dimensional free algebra (1.5) provide an algebraic framework which underlies
and extends much of what is known about large n, and we are optimistic that
these algebras will provide a foundation for the future study of the master
eld.

2 unication of action and phase-space

master fields

2.1 fifth-time formulation and euclidean quantum

eld theory

we consider a general su(n)-invariant matrix model with euclidean action
s

< t rw >= 1z (d) es t r[w],
s = nt r[s(


n

w = m1 . . . mn,

)],

 = z (d)es

(2.1a)

m = 1 . . . d

(2.1b)

and follow the fth-time formulation [2] to interpret the model as a quantum
system, with a (fth time) hamiltonian formulation, in one higher dimension.
the resulting picture is a pedestrian version of operator euclidean quantum
eld theory.

in the hamiltonian formulation, the matrix elds m are operators and

the action averages are reinterpreted as ground state averages:

< t rw >= h.0 | t rw | 0.i,

| 0.i = 0() =  1

2 e s

2

(2.2)

where the dot in the (unreduced) ground state follows the notation of ref. [1].
we may also introduce momentum operators and equal fth-time commuta-
tors as



m
rs =

1
i
rs) = m
sr,

(m

m
sr

,

[m

rs, n

tu] = i mn st ru

(m

rs) = m
sr,

r, s = 1 . . . n

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

and, following ref. [1], we use the momenta to construct matrix creation and
annihilation operators

rs = 2am
bm

rs = f m
rs + im
rs,
(bm)rs = 2(am)rs = f m
rs  im
rs,
s
1
m
2
sr

rs =

f m

.

bm
rs | 0.i = 0
h.0 | (bm)rs = 0

(2.4a)
(2.4b)

(2.4c)

4

ref. [1] also tells us that the quantities

emn

rs = 2c mn

rs = [bm

rt , (bn)ts] =

2s
tr n
st

m

(2.5)

will be useful at large n.

as for the fth-time hamiltonian itself, we may choose any of a very large

number of operators, for example

h5 =

1
2

t r(bm bm),

h5 | 0.i = 0

(2.6)

so long as the choice provides us with a healthy hilbert space and its ground
state is | 0.i in (2.2). the equal fth-time averages of any such higher-
dimensional system will be the original euclidean action averages, and, more-
over, the large n action averages are controlled by the phase-space master
elds [1], which are classical solutions of the higher-dimensional theory. the
parallel with the ads/cft correspondence [3-5] is clear , if only we are
clever enough to choose both an interesting action theory and an interesting
higher-dimensional extension. except for a simple example based on (2.6) in
app. a, further consideration of this issue is beyond the scope of the present
paper, and we will not choose any specic form for h5 here.

2.2 reduced formulation

we may now go over to reduced states and operators for the large n action
theory, drawing heavily on the results of ref. [1]. important relations given
there include

h.0 | t r[(


n

)w] | 0.i = nh0 | w | 0i  n < w >

(2.7)

where m is the master eld, w are products of the master eld in the word
notation (1.2a), and the undotted vacuum is the reduced ground state. the
reduced equal (fth) time algebra involves the tilde operators introduced in
ref. [1]

[m, n] = [ m, n] = i m,n | 0ih0 |
[m, n] = [m, n] = 0

(2.8a)
(2.8b)

5


m = m,
m | 0i = m | 0i,

[m, m] = i(d  1+ | 0ih0 |)

m = m
m | 0i = m | 0i

(2.8c)
(2.8d)
(2.8e)

where the operators m are the reduced momenta.

the reduced creation and annihilation operators corresponding to (2.4)

are

bm = 2am = fm() + im,

m = 2a
b

m = fm()  im.

(2.9)

these operators satisfy the interacting cuntz algebra [1]

bmb

n = emn() = 2cmn()
m(e1)mnbn = 1 | 0ih0 |
b
bm | 0i = h0 | b
at equal (fth) time, as well as the relations

m = 0

[ p, bmb

n] = 0

bm b

n | 0i = 2i[n, fm] | 0i = 2cmn() | 0i = emn() | 0i

which will be useful below.

(2.10a)

(2.10b)

(2.10c)

(2.11a)

(2.11b)

it should be noted that haans [6] euclidean master eld relation appears

in our notation as

(fm + im) | 0i = 0.

(2.12)

although this relation follows from (2.8e), (2.9) and (2.10c), the operators
fm + im do not satisfy any simple algebra.

2.3 sharpening a tool

in ref. [1], the bb relation (2.10a) was proven by analysis of the ground
state wave function (and follows from (2.2) in the action case), but a conjec-
ture was oered which would give this result directly in the reduced operator
formulation. here we prove this conjecture, assuming only the completeness
of the basis w | 0i.

6

theorem:

if [x, m] = [y, m] = 0, m and x | 0i = y | 0i,

proof: introduce the complete set of states

and follow the steps

| wi  w | 0i =  w | 0i

then x = y.

(2.13)

(2.14)

x | wi = x  w | 0i =  wx | 0i =  wy | 0i = y  w | 0i = y | wi.

(2.15)

in practice, this theorem can be read as:

[ m, o1(, )] = 0, m  o1(, ) = o2()

o1(, ) | 0i = o2() | 0i

(2.16a)
(2.16b)

where o2() is determined by the ground state condition (2.16b). this is
the form conjectured in ref. [1]. as a rst application of this theorem, the
relation (2.10a) of the interacting cuntz algebra follows immediately from
(2.11).

using appendices c and e of ref. [1], and in particular the results,

(2.17a)

we may compute the operators fm and emn of the interacting cuntz algebra
(2.9),(2.10) for any action:

(2.21b)

where the notation w  w means that the two words are equivalent under a
cyclic permutation of their letters.
for actions with even powers of  only, we may set the odd vevs to zero.

we also nd that the simple forms

fm = fm(m),

emn = em(m) m,n

(2.22)

follow for matrix models of independent matrices (free random variables [9]).
the special case of free actions and/or oscillators (which give the cuntz
algebra) is discussed in app. b.

3 annihilation operators

in secs. 3-7 below, action and phase-space master elds are discussed on an
equal footing.

8

3.1 linear in 

we turn now to the construction of the innite dimensional free algebra,
beginning with the composite annihilation operators bw:

bw  bw = bm1bm2 . . . bmn,

bw | 0i = w,0 | 0i.

these operators automatically satisfy the product rule

bwbw = bww

and moreover we nd with (2.8) and (2.10c) that
[ p, bm] = p,m | 0ih0 |

[ p, bmn] = p,m | 0ih0 | bn = p,m | 0ih0 | 2fn()
h0 | ()m = h0 | {[(), m]  ifm() ()} = h0 | m()

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

(3.3c)

where the operators m() are determined in principle as in ref. [1]. it follows
that

[ p, bmw] = p,m | 0ih0 | bw = p,m | 0ih0 | gw()

(3.4)

where the operators gw are to be determined. the theorem in (2.13) then
tells us that the annihilation operators are linear in the reduced momenta
m

bmw = fmw() + imgw()

g0 = 1,

gm = 2fm

(3.5a)

(3.5b)

where the operators fw are also to be determined. in what follows, we will
discuss this surprising result from a number of viewpoints.

3.2 determination of fw and gw

in this subsection, we give an independent inductive proof of the formula
(3.5a) which also determines the coecients fw and gw recursively in terms
of the known operators fm and emn.

to begin, we rewrite the interacting cuntz relation (2.10a) in terms of

reduced momenta, using (2.9):

bmb

n = emn()  mn + imfn  ifmn + fmfn  emn = 0.

(3.6)

9

the  form of this relation will be called the rst master constraint below. it
allows us to eliminate mn in favor of terms linear in , and hence to verify
for example that bmn = bmbn is indeed linear in . a proof by induction
then starts with

bmbnw = bmnw  (fm + im)(fnw + ingw) = fmnw + imgnw

(3.7)

where we have assumed the form (3.5a) and the left side of (3.7) is a special
case of (3.2).

using (3.6) in (3.7), one then obtains the recursion relations

gmw = fmw + fmgw

which can be rearranged into the more useful forms

fmnw = fm(fnw + fngw)  emngw

gmnw = gmgnw  emngw

fmw = gmw  fmgw.

(3.8a)

(3.8b)

(3.9a)

(3.9b)

these relations are easily iterated to any desired order, and we list here the
results

g0 = 1,

gm = 2fm,

gmn = gmgn  emn

(3.10a)

gmnp = gmgngp  gmenp  emngp

(3.10b)
gmnpq = gmgngpgq gmgnepq gmenpgq  emngpgq + emnepq (3.10c)
(3.10d)
fmn = 2fmfn  emn,

fmnp = 4fmfnfp  fmenp  2emnfp

for the rst few words of f and g.

more generally, the recursion relations can be used to prove the following

properties

g =

g 

w = g w,

f 
mw = g wm  g wfm

(3.11)

1  mgm() + mnemn()
(1  mfm()) g = xw

(3.12b)

10

(3.13)
here m (with products w) is a free-algebraic source or place marker
whose only property is that it commutes with m and m.

gwmgnw = gwmnw + gwemngw.

the generating functions (3.12a) and (3.12b) show that gw and fw are
free-algebraic generalizations of chebyshev polynomials (see also subsec. 3.3
and app. b).

we also mention the relations

bmw = b

mgw + gmw,

b 
mw = g wbm + g wm

(3.14)

which are a useful alternative to the basic equation (3.5a), and the relations

gwmn = gwmgn  gwemn,
fwmn = fwmgn  fwemn,

g0 = 1,

gm = 2fm

f0 = 1,

fm = 1fm

(3.15a)

(3.15b)

which show a complete symmetry of the recursion relations for gw and fw,
except for their initial conditions. the relations

mgw | 0i = ifmw | 0i,

b
mgw | 0i = gmw | 0i

[im, gnw] | 0i = emngw | 0i
[im, fn] | 0i = cmn() | 0i

also follow from the discussion above. the relation (3.16c), which is a special
case of (3.16b), was given in ref. [1].

3.3 one-matrix models

in the case of general one-matrix (action or hamiltonian) models the opera-
tors f and e commute, and w  [w], giving the simpler forms

(3.16a)

(3.16b)

(3.16c)

(3.17a)

(3.17b)

(3.17c)

xk=0

(3.17e)

which include the chebyshev polynomials themselves in (3.17c). the nite
operator product expansion in (3.17e) follows immediately from this form.
according to ref. [1], the quantity  in (3.17d) is the ground state density
of the action or hamiltonian system.

another special case with simplications is that of many oscillators and/or

free actions (see app. b).

3.4 master constraints

using (3.5a), the composition law

bmwbn = bmwn

(3.18)

can be written out in two equivalent forms, called the master constraints,

mgwn + imf 

n w + fmw(in) + fmwn  fmwfn = 0

b

mgwbn = b

mgwn + gmwbn  gmwn

(3.19a)

(3.19b)

and (3.19a) contains the rst master constraint (3.6) as the special case when
w = 0.

more generally, the form (3.19a) of the master constraints allow us to
eliminate quadratic forms mgwn in favor of forms linear in the reduced
momenta, and similarly for b

mgwbn in (3.19b).

in hamiltonian theories, constraints are constants of the motion and the
rst master constraint, which is equivalent to bmb
n  emn = 0, was noted
as a set of d2 constants of the motion in ref. [1]. it is shown in app. c that
all the higher master constraints are in fact composites of the rst master
constraint, so there are no new independent constants of the motion in this
list.

4 creation operators

4.1 creation operators and the natural basis

the creation operators of the innite dimensional free algebra are dened as
the hermitian conjugates of the annihilation operators

mn . . . b

w = b
b 
b 
mw = fmw()  ig w()m

m1 = b

w

h0 | b 
and therefore satisfy the product rule
w b 

b 

w = h0 | w,0

w = b 
ww .

(4.1a)

(4.1b)
(4.1c)

(4.2)

the set of all these creation operators on the ground state is a natural com-
plete [1] basis, and we see from (3.9b), (3.16a) and (4.1b) that this basis can
be expressed in terms of the polynomial gws as

(b w) | 0i = b w | 0i = gw() | 0i

< gw() >= w,0.

(4.3a)

(4.3b)

in what follows, the states on the right and left of (4.3a) will be called
the natural basis and its operator form respectively. further discussion of
completeness is given in subsec. 5.4.

4.2 bb relations
using (3.5a), (4.1b) and the rst master constraint (3.6), we nd the bb
algebra

and the relations

b 
mw bnw = g wm bnw  g w bmnw

b
m(e1)mnbn = 1 | 0ih0 |

b 
mpw (e1)mnbnqw = g wpbqw  g wbpqw  g wp | 0ih0 | gqw

also follow immediately from the interacting cuntz algebra and the compo-
sition laws (3.18) and (4.2).

a more symmetric version of (4.4) and (4.5) is

(4.4)

(4.5a)
(4.5b)

(4.6a)

b 

w bw = b 

w gw + g wbw  g ww

b 

mw (e1)mnbnw = b 

(4.6b)
where (4.6a) can be used to linearize (4.6b). these forms follow directly
from (3.14) and the interacting cuntz algebra.

w bw  g w | 0ih0 | gw

13

4.3 local and non-local

in ref. [1], many reduced operators were called non-local because they in-
volved arbitrarily-high powers of the reduced momenta m, and others were
called local because they involved no more than two powers of the reduced
momenta. the results above blur this distinction.

as an example [1], consider the (hermitian) isotropic oscillator hamil-
tonian h, which may now be reexpressed in terms of the generators of the
innite dimensional free algebra:

w aw = xw6=0

(4.7a)

(4.7b)

(4.7c)

the starting point is non-local because each of the cuntz operators in the
products aw = aw = am1 . . . amn is linear in the reduced momentum, while
(4.7b) and its hermitian conjugate (4.7c) are local but non-polynomial
because they are linear in the reduced momenta.

although we will not discuss it explicitly here, the phenomenon of this
section also generates new large n eld identications (see ref. [1]) in the
unreduced theory.

5 dual basis

5.1 denition
we wish to nd new polynomials {tw()} which are vev-orthogonal to the
set {gw()}
(5.1)

< tw() gw() >= w,w,

t0() = 1

and we will refer to the set of states {< 0|tw()} as the dual basis.
erating function for the t s

towards the construction of these polynomials, we rst postulate a gen-

y =

1

1  mm + x()

wtw()

= xw

(5.2a)

14

x() = xw

w xw,

x0 = 0

(5.2b)

where m is another free-algebraic source (like m above) and the quantity
x() is to be determined. note that the relations

< tw >= w,0,

< y >= 1

(5.3)

follow from (5.1) and (5.2) respectively.

next, follow the steps

h0 | y b

m = h0 | [ y ,im] = h0 | y [1  n n + x, im] y
= h0 | y m | 0ih0 | y = mh0 | y

(5.4a)
(5.4b)

where we have used (2.1a), (2.8e) and (5.2). repeating this, we obtain

h0 | y (b)w | 0i = w < y >= w

(5.5)

which gives us the desired result (5.1).

to compute tw and xw explicitly, multiply (5.2a) on the left by the

inverse of y to obtain

1 = xw

wtw  xm,w

mwmtw + xw,w

ww

xwtw.

(5.6)

then, equating coecients of each  word, we nd the recursion relation for
tw

tmw = mtw  xw=w1w2

multiplying in the other order leads to

xmw1tw2,

t0 = 1.

(5.7)

twm = twm  xw=w1w2

tw1xw2m

(5.8)

and the vevs of these equations

xmw =< mtw >=< twm >= xwm

(5.9)

determine the xws and show that they have cyclic symmetry in the letters
of their words.

15

5.2 examples

because the t s and xs are unfamiliar, we list the rst few words of each:

t0 = 1,

tm = m  xm,

tmn = (m  xm)(n  xn)  xmn (5.10a)
tmnp = (mxm)(nxn)(pxp)(mxm)xnpxmn(pxp)xmnp
(5.10b)

x0 = 0,

xm =< m >,

xmn =< mn > xmxn

xmnp =< mnp > xmxnp  xnxmp  xpxmn  xmxnxp

(5.11a)

(5.11b)

xmnpq = < mnpq > xmxnpq  xnxmpq  xpxmnq  xqxmnp
 xmnxpq  xmqxnp  xnxmxpq  xnxpxmq  xnxqxmp
 xpxmxqn  xqxpxmn  xqxmxnp  xmxnxpxq.

(5.11c)

one sees that the xws so far match the planar connected parts discussed
in refs. [10, 8], and one also sees that tw(), with < tw >= w,0, may be
considered as a type of normal ordered product : w : of the reduced elds.

5.3 more general results

from the recursive denitions (5.7-5.9) we nd

t 
w = t w,

x 

w = x w

< gw tw >= w,w

as well as the following relations

tw = w  xw=w1w2w3

tw1xw2w3

twtw = xw

cw,w,wtw,

[w]  [w] + [w]

< tmtw >= xmw(1  w,0)

(5.12a)

(5.12b)

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15a)

< tmntw >= xmnw(1  w,0) + xw=w1 w2

w1,w26=0

...

xnw1xmw2

(5.15b)

z(j)  xw

< w > jw = 1 + x(jz(j)).

(5.16)

in particular, (5.13) can also be iterated to obtain the t s. the relation in
(5.14) is an operator product expansion, whose sum obeys the selection rule
shown because the t s are nite polynomials in . the list of relations begun
in (5.15) shows correspondingly higher powers of xw when extended to more
general words.

the nal relation (5.16), with j another free-algebraic source, is proven
in app. d. this is the standard relation [10, 8] between the generating func-
tions z and x of planar and connected planar correlators respectively, and
completes the identication of xw as the planar connected part with [w] legs.

5.4 completeness
the dual basis {< 0|tw()} is complete because the {w | 0i} basis is com-
plete, and therefore the basis {b w | 0i = gw()|0 >} is also complete 3.
this gives the completeness statements

1 = xw

gw() | 0ih0 | tw() = xw

tw() | 0ih0 | gw()

(5.17)

and various consequences such as

w,w = xw

< twtw >< gwgw > .

(5.18)

moreover, either set of polynomials {gw()} or {tw()} give a complete
basis 4 for expansion of any polynomial in 

gw() < tw()f () >= xw

f () = xw
tw() < gw()f () > .
3a dierent argument for the completeness of bw | 0i was given in ref. [1]
4there are questions which need further study concerning the domain of convergence
of expansions in the gws when innite sums are involved. for example, in the case of
one matrix with a pure 4 action the functions gw() have no linear term in  and yet
eq. (5.21a) says that an innite sum of such functions is equal to .

(5.19)

17

we have already encountered such an expansion in (5.14).

another operator product expansion which will be useful below is

gwgw = xw

gw < twgwgw > .

(5.20)

the sum on the right of (5.20) is generally innite, but nite in the case
of oscillators/free actions (see app. b). it will also be useful to consider
expansions of products of the master eld:

m = xw
mn = xw

xmw gw() = xw
(xmnw + xw=w1w2

...

gw()xwm

(5.21a)

xnw1xmw2) gw()

(5.21b)

the proof of these follow readily from (5.19) and (5.15).

5.5 operator form of the dual basis
recall that b 
w | 0i is the operator form of the basis gw() | 0i. to obtain
the operator form of the dual basis h0 | tw(), we rst dene a new set of
operators bm
(5.22)

bm  (e1)mnbn.

the interacting cuntz algebra (2.10) implies that these operators satisfy a
(dual basis) cuntz algebra

bmb

n = m,n,

b
m

bm = 1 | 0ih0 |

bm | 0i = h0 | b

m = 0

(5.23a)

(5.23b)

although bm and b
play a central role in the discussion of sec. 7.

m are not hermitian conjugates. this curious fact will

next, we consider the product of any number of bs

bw = bw = bm1 . . . bmn

and note that

h0 | b

wgw | 0i = h0 | b

wb w | 0i = w,w.

18

(5.24)

(5.25)

it follows that

h0 | (tw  b w)gw | 0i = 0,
and this gives the operator form of the dual basis
h0 | b w = h0 | tw()
w | 0ih0 | bw
b 
1 = xw

 w

(5.26)

(5.27a)

(5.27b)

because the basis gw | 0i is complete.
the planar connected parts

the operator form of the dual basis gives us a number of new forms for

xmwn =< tmwn >=< b wmn >=< b w(e1)mn >=< tw(e1)mn >

where we have used (2.8e) and (3.3a). then the useful relation

(e1())mn = xw

xmwngw()

(5.28)

(5.29)

follows immediately from (5.19).

for free random variables, we can say more. taken together, the form of
e in (2.22) and the nal form of x in (5.28) show that xmwn  m,n in this
case. then, the cyclic symmetry of xw tells us that the only nonzero planar
connected parts are the single letter xs

xw(m)  xm...m 6= 0,

m = 1 . . . d.

(5.30)

this simple fact means that the computation of the planar connected parts
(see sec. 8) is one dimensional and, via eq. (5.16), the relation (5.30) explains
many intricate identities among the planar parts.

6 bb

we have so far veried all the relations of the innite dimensional free algebra
(1.5) except for the bb relation (1.5d). this relation requires a combination
of several of the principles we have discussed above, and will be developed
in stages.

19

note rst the relations

bwmb

n = bwemn,
bwmb 

wn = bwemnb 

w

bmb 

wn = emnb 
w

(6.1a)

(6.1b)

which follow from (2.10a) alone. in (6.1b), we see that this direction soon
fails to produce relations linear in bw and b 
w .

to obtain relations linear in b and b, we consider the product bmwb 
nw
using the forms (3.14) of these operators in terms of the interacting cuntz
operators. among the four resulting terms, the only term quadratic in b,
b is b
mgwgwbn. this term may be linearized by rst using the com-
pleteness relation (5.20) and then using the master constraints in the form
(3.19b). we nd two alternative forms of the result:

bmwb 
+xw
bmwb 
xw

nw = [b
< twgwg w > [b

mgwg wn + gmwg wbn  gmwg wn]
mgwn + gmwbn  gmwn]

nw = [bmwg wn + gmwb 

< twgwg w > [bmwn + b

nw  gmwg wn]
n wm  gmwn].



(6.2)

(6.3)

these forms are linear in the operators b, b but the coecients are functions
of .

a form which is strictly linear in the generators bw, b 

w can be derived
from (6.2) by again using the expansion (5.20) for the products of two gs
and then using the formulas (3.14) in reverse. the result is

bmwb 

(bmwfw,w,n,w + f 

nw = xw
fw,w,n,w =< twgwg wn > xu

w,w,m,wb 

nw ) + emw;nw()

(6.4a)

w,un < tugwg w >

(6.4b)

emw;nw = gmwg wn +xw
gmw < twgwg wn > gwn < twgmwg w >].

[gmwn < twgwgw >

(6.4c)

(6.4d)

one may compare this general structure with the simple oscillator results in
app. b.

7 forms of the master field

7.1 basic form

the form (5.21a) of the master eld in terms of the basis gw

m = xw

xmwgw()

(7.1)

will be called the basic form of the master eld. all the other forms of the
master eld below follow from the basic form.

7.2

in terms of interacting cuntz operators

the basis gw is a set of polynomials (see sec. 3) in gm and emn, which may
in turn be written as

gm = bm + b
m,

emn = bmb
n.

(7.2)

these relations allow us to express the gws and hence the master eld (7.1)
in terms of interacting cuntz operators:

m = xm + xmn(bn + b

n) + xmnp(bnbp + b

n(bp + b

p)) + . . . .

(7.3)

7.3

in terms of ordinary cuntz operators

recall the construction [1] of ordinary cuntz operators from the interacting
cuntz operators

am = (e 1

2 )mnbn,

a
m = b

n(e 1

2 )nm

am | 0i = h0 | a

m = 0

(7.4a)

(7.4b)

ama

n = m,n,

a
mam = 1 | 0ih0 |,

where a is the hermitian conjugate of a. this allows us to express the master
eld (7.3) in terms of ordinary cuntz operators:

m = xm + xmn((e

1

2 )nqaq + a

q(e

1

2 )qn) + . . . .

(7.5)

21

7.4 dual basis form

to express the master eld in this form, follow the steps

bm = (e1)mnbn = xw

xmwngw(fn + in) = xw

xmwn(gwn  bwn) (7.6)

where we have used the form (4.1b) for b 
adding xm, we obtain the dual basis form of the master eld

w and the identities (3.9b),(5.29).

xmwgw = bm +xw
recall from (5.23) that the operators bm, b
m) also satisfy
an ordinary cuntz algebra. other ways of writing the dual basis form include

m = xw

m (with b

m 6= b

xmwbw.

(7.7)

m = bm +xw

xm wb 

w = bm(1 + x(b))

h0 | x(b) = 0.

(7.8a)

(7.8b)

here, the rst form in (7.8a) emphasizes that the master eld is linear in the
generators of the innite dimensional free algebra, and x(b) in the second
form is the generating function of the planar connected parts with the free
algebraic source m replaced by b
m.

note that the forms (7.7) and (7.8a) of the master eld (and other forms
throughout this section which are equal to m in (7.1)) appear to involve the
reduced momenta m in the creation and annihilation operators. however,
as the reader is encouraged to verify, all such  terms cancel.

7.5 second dual basis form

in spite of appearances, the dual basis form (7.8a) of the master eld is
hermitian (as are all the previous forms), which tells us that

m = 

m = b

m +xw

xmwbw,

b

m = b

n(e1)nm.

(7.9)

the operators b, b, with b 6= b, form another (second dual basis) cuntz
algebra

bm b

n = m,n,

b
mbm = 1 | 0ih0 |,
22

bm | 0i = h0 | b

m = 0 (7.10a)

b 
w | 0i = tw() | 0i
b 
1 = xw
w | 0ih0 | bw

(7.10b)

(7.10c)

and we see that b 

w creates the ket form of the dual basis.

7.6 non-hermitian forms

because the two sets of operators (am, a
cuntz algebra, the two sets are related by a similarity transformation s

n) both satisfy the

n) and ( bm, b

sams1 = bm = (e1())mnbn = (e 1

2 ())mnan

sa

ms1 = b

m = a

n(e

1

2 ())nm

(7.11a)

(7.11b)

and s cannot be unitary because b is not the hermitian conjugate of b.

then we see that the dual form of the master eld in (7.8a) is the her-
mitian counterpart of the non-hermitian gopakumar-gross form mm of the
master eld:

m = smms1

xmwaw = am(1 + x(a)) 6= m 
m.

(7.12a)

(7.12b)

mm = am +xw

our algebraic derivation of (7.12b) complements the diagrammatic derivation
in ref. [7]. the one-matrix form m = a + mcm+1am of the non-hermitian
master eld was determined earlier in ref. [9].

the hermitian conjugate of the gopakumar-gross form, which also serves
as a master eld, is related to the second dual form (7.9) of the hermitian
master eld as follows

1

s1 ams = bm = (e
m = b

2 )mnan
n(e 1
n(e1)nm = a
2 )nm
m = 
m = s1 m 
ms
xmwaw = (1 + x(a))a
m.

s1 a

ms = b

m 

m = a

m +xw

(7.13a)

(7.13b)
(7.13c)
(7.13d)

these relations are nothing but the hermitian conjugate of (7.11) and (7.12).

23

7.7

in terms of planar correlators

the relation (5.16) can be read as

z(j) = 1 + x(b)

b

m = jmz(j),

jm = b

mz 1(j)

bmjn = m,nz 1(j),

h0 | z(j) = h0 |

(7.14a)

(7.14b)

(7.14c)

where z(j) is the generating function of planar correlators. the quantum
source jm lives in a fourth cuntz algebra



jm  z(j) bm,

bm = z 1(j)


jm


jm

jn = m,n,

jm


jm

= 1 | 0ih0 |


jm | 0i = h0 | jm = 0

(7.15a)

(7.15b)

(7.15c)

which follows from (7.14) and the cuntz algebra (5.23) of b and b.

this gives the forms of the master eld

m = bmz(j) = z 1(j)


jm

z(j)

w = z 1(j)(


j

)wz(j)

(7.16a)

(7.16b)

in terms of the planar correlators.

7.8

in terms of planar 1pi parts

the master eld can also be written as a function of the planar connected
one particle irreducible (1pi) parts. to see this, we rst decompose the dual
basis form of the master eld (7.8a) into its classical part m and its quantum
part bm

m = m + bm
m(b)  bmx(b) = xw

24

xmwb w

(7.17a)

(7.17b)

mb

m = b

mm = x(b).

(7.17c)

our denition of the classical part m is equivalent to the eld called  in
ref. [8], but the identities in (7.17c) are new. to prove these, one uses the
cyclic symmetry of xw.

the planar eective action () is dened as

()  mb

m = b

bm() = m,

mm = x(b) = xw
h0 | () = 0

ww

(7.18a)

(7.18b)

where w is the cyclically symmetric planar 1pi part with [w] legs. this
denition of () follows ref. [10] but diers by a minus sign from the
denition of ref. [8], and we note in particular that the legendre transform
dened in ref. [8]

x(b) = () + b

mm + mb
m

(7.19)

is satised trivially by (7.18a).

then the master eld can be written as

m = m + bm = bm(1 + ())

(7.20)

by changing variables from b to . but this is only half the job because we
also want to nd the cuntz algebra in which m resides.

this is most easily done in the case xm = 0 (no tadpoles), which we

assume below. in this case, one has the additional relations

m = b

nnm = mnb
n

mn(b) = xw

xmwnb w,

mn | 0i = (e1)mn | 0i

bmn = mn

(7.21a)

(7.21b)

(7.21c)

and mn is invertible because it begins with xmn. this gives us the cuntz
algebra of m:



m  (1)mn bn



m

n = m,n,

m



m

= 1 | 0ih0 |

25

(7.22a)

(7.22b)


m | 0i = h0 | m = 0

and we may now express the dual basis cuntz operators as

b

m = n(1)nm = (1)mnn

moreover, the relation

bm = mn



n

.

b

m =



m

()

(7.22c)

(7.23a)

(7.23b)

(7.24)

now follows from (7.22a), (7.15b) and (7.23a).

our next task is to nd the  dependence of mn(b). note rst that

() = mn(1)nm

follows from (7.18a) and (7.23a), and this gives us the desired result

(1())mn =





m

n

().

(7.25)

(7.26)

using (7.23b) and (7.24) in (7.20), we have found the forms of the master
eld

m = mn()

(1 + ()) = m + mn()



n



n

(7.27)

in the , 

 basis.

comparing these two forms of the master eld (or the two forms of b in

(7.23a)), we also nd the consistency relation



m

() = (

n

())n

(7.28)

but this is only the statement that w is cyclically symmetric.

8 forms of the schwinger-dyson equations

in this section, we use the forms of the master eld to quickly derive a num-
ber of new free-algebraic forms of the large n schwinger-dyson equations

26

for action theories.5 the rst form in subsec. 8.1 is novel, and the rest,
although packaged dierently, are closely related to known free-algebraic
formulations [10, 8, 11, 12].
in all our formulations, the dynamical input
is stored in the operators gm(), emn() of the interacting cuntz algebra
(2.9),(2.10).

8.1 the basic form as a computational system

we consider rst the basic form of the master eld

m = xw

xmwgw()

(8.1)

which, by matching  dependence on left and right, is itself a computational
system for the planar connected parts.

we illustrate this by studying the classical limit of the system. reinstat-

ing h temporarily, we nd that

gm = o(h0),

emn = o(h)

because emn in (2.5) is a commutator. the classical limit of (8.1)

xmwgw,

m  xw

gw  gw = gm1 . . . gmn

(8.2)

(8.3)

is then obtained by neglecting all e terms in the gws (see eq.(3.9a)).

for deniteness, we consider the solution of this equation for the general

quartic interaction

gm = 2mm + mnpqnpq

(8.4)

where mnpq is cyclically symmetric in its indices. in this case, (8.3) contains
only odd powers of  and we may set the coecients of each odd power to
zero, obtaining the list of equations

 :

m = xmn2nn

3 :

0 = xmnnpqrpqr + xmnpq2nn2pp2qq

(8.5a)

(8.5b)

5another form of the schwinger-dyson equations follows as null state ward identities

of the innite dimensional free algebra (see app. e).

27

...

the master eld m is a free variable (with no relations), so the unique
solution of this list is easily obtained:

xmn =

1

2m

m,n,

xmnpq = 

mnpq

2m2n2p2q

(8.6a)

xmnpqrs =

1

q 2 xt

1
2t

(mnpttqrs + smnttpqr + rsmttnpq)

(8.6b)

...

these results are recognized as the tree-graph contributions to the planar
connected parts.

for the special case of free random variables, the basic form (8.1) decou-

ples into d one-matrix problems

m = xw(m)

xw(m)gw(m)(m)

(8.7)

according to eqs. (2.22), (5.30) and (3.9a). the one-matrix bases gw(m)(m)
have the decoupled form discussed in subsec. 3.3.

other relations of this type, e.g. eq. (5.29), may also be considered as

computational systems.

8.2 dual basis system

the planar connected parts x(b) satisfy

b

m + emn() bn = gm()

p = bp(1 + x(b))

(8.8a)

(8.8b)

which we record together as the dual basis system

b

m + emn( b(1 + x)) bn = gm( b(1 + x)).

(8.9)

to derive this system, start with gm = bm + b
(5.22) and use the dual basis form (8.8b) of the master eld.

m, go to the dual basis with

we have checked that the system (8.9), although packaged dierently, is
equivalent to the schwinger-dyson equations derived diagrammatically for

28

the planar connected parts in ref. [8]. in particular, our cuntz operators
bm act on x(b) as the operator
of [8] acts on their w (j), but the two
operators are not the same because

jm



[ bm, c] = 0,



jm

c = 0

(8.10)

for any c-number c. the e term in (8.9) collects the results of this dierence.
in what follows, we make some additional remarks on the structure of the
dual basis system.

we begin by discussing this system in the case of one matrix, where right

multiplication by powers of b gives the simple equation 6

e(




)  g(




) + 2 = 0,

() = 1 + x(),

(0) = 1

(8.11)

for any interaction. (we have replaced b by a commuting source .) in the
special case of the quartic interaction (see (2.18)), this reads

2(  1) + 2(m2(  1)  x2  2) = 0

(8.12)

and, except that x2 appears as an unknown, this is the cubic equation found
in ref. [10] for this interaction. in fact, the equation determines x2 along
with the rest of x() in a perturbative or semiclassical expansion. to begin
the perturbation theory, set  = 0 to nd () = 1 + 2
m2 . more general
perturbation theory is discussed in app. f.

for the special case of free random variables, the dual basis system (8.9)

decouples into d one-matrix systems

b

m + em(m) bm = gm(m)
m = bm + xw(m)

xmw(m)b w(m)

(8.13a)
(8.13b)

which comprise d decoupled systems of the form (8.11).

the classical limit of the full system (8.9) is

b
m  gm(),

p  bpx(b) = xw

xpwb w

(8.14)

6this equation gives the large  form x()  c 1

p 1+ 2

p when g()  cp at large .

29

because (1+x) in (8.8b) should be replaced by the dimensionless combination
(1 + x/h). as an example, the classical limit (8.14) reads

0 = (b

m  2mxmnb
n) 
q + mnpqxnrb
pb
nb

(2mxmnpqb

rxpsb

sxqtb

t ) + . . .

(8.15)

for the general quartic interaction (8.4). setting each power of b to zero
separately, we nd the same tree graphs (8.6) for the planar connected parts.

an equivalent form of the dual basis system (8.9) is

a
m + emn(m)an = gm(m), mp = ap(1 + x(a))

(8.16)

in terms of ordinary cuntz operators and the gopakumar-gross form of the
master eld.

the other forms of the planar schwinger-dyson equations below are the

forms taken by eq. (8.9) in dierent bases.

8.3 equation for the planar correlators

the generating function z(j) of planar correlators satises

jmz(j)  gm(z 1(j)


j

z(j)) + emn(z 1(j)


j

z(j))z 1(j)


jn

= 0. (8.17)

to derive this, use (8.8a), (7.14b), (7.15a) and the form (7.16a) of the master
eld. this can be simplied to

(z(j)jm  gm(


j

))z(j) + emn(


j

)


jn

= 0

(8.18)

for any polynomial interaction.

for the one-matrix case the system (8.18) reduces to the quadratic equa-

tion

(jz(j))2  g(

1
j

)jz(j) + e(

1
j

) = 0,

z(0) = 1

(8.19)

for any interaction. this equation may also be obtained from eq. (8.11) and

(b) = z(j),

b = jz(j),

(b)
b =

1
j

(8.20)

30

which is the one dimensional form of  = 1 + x and (7.14).

again, the relations (8.18) or (8.19) are equivalent to those given in
ref. [8], although ours are packaged dierently. in particular, our deriva-
tive with respect to j is a cuntz operator satisfying


jm

c = c


jm

(8.21)

when c is a c-number, and not the rule c
= 0 satised by the derivative in
jm
ref. [8]. the dierence between these two operators is again collected in the
e term of (8.18).

8.4 equation for the planar eective action

the planar eective action () satises



m

() + emn( + 




)np()



p

= gm( + 




).

(8.22)

to derive this system, use (7.23b), (7.24) and (7.27) in (8.8a). although
packaged dierently, this system is equivalent to the equation for  given in
ref. [8]. (again, our cuntz operator 
 commutes with c-numbers and so is
not equal to the operator 

 of [8].)

for the classical limit of (8.22), we know to neglect e and the quantum
 of the master eld. this gives immediately the classical limit

part b =  
of the planar eective action

()  mgm()

(8.23)

for any theory.

for the general one-matrix model, the system (8.22) simplies to

{()  g([1 + 1()])}() + 2e([1 + 1()]) = 0.

(8.24)

this equation can also be obtained directly from (8.11) by the transformation

 = 1 + x(b) = 1 + ()

b =  = ()/

(8.25a)

(8.25b)

31

which is the one-dimensional form of (7.18). the relations (8.25) were pointed
out in [10], and we have checked for the quartic case (2.18) that the resulting
cubic equation is in agreement with that given there.

appendix a. large n as higher-dimensional classical solution

the fth-time formulation [2] of any euclidean action theory allows us
to compute the large n limit of the action theory as a classical solution of
a higher-dimensional theory, in parallel with the ads/cft correspondence
[3-5]. there is great latitude in the choice of the fth-time theory, but any
choice will give the same large n averages for the original theory. moreover,
other methods of higher-dimensional extension are known (see e.g. ref. [13])
and others still can be invented.

as an illustration, we consider the action theory

s = t r(

m22 +

and we will choose the higher-dimensional extension (overdot is fth-time
derivative)

theory.

appendix b. oscillators/free actions

a number of simplications occur for oscillator hamiltonians and/or free
action theories, which we treat together here in the oscillator notation (for
free action theories, s = 1

nt r(nn), replace 2n by m2
n)

2 nm2

gm = 2mm,

emn = 2mm,n,

xmn =

1

2m

m,n.

(b.1)

all other planar connected parts are zero.

comparing the generating functions (3.12a) and (5.2a), we nd that the

basis polynomials gw and the dual basis polynomials tw are proportional

gw() = (2)wtw().

it follows that

< gwgw >= (2)ww,w,

< twtw >= ((2)1)ww,w

gwmgnw = gwmnw + 2mm,ngwgw

twmtnw = twmnw + xmntwtw

(b.2)

(b.3a)

(b.3b)

(b.3c)

where (b.3a) and (b.3b) follow from (5.1) and (3.13) respectively, while
(b.3c) follows from (b.3b). the solution of the recursion relation (b.3b)
is the nite operator product expansion

gwgw = xu

w,w1u w,uw2(2)u gw1w2

(b.4)

which is a free-algebraic generalization of a familiar decomposition rule for the
product of two chebyshev polynomials (see also the general one-dimensional
operator product expansion in eq. (3.17e)). using (b.2) in (b.4), one also
obtains the explicit form (in this case) of the twtw operator product expan-
sion in (5.14).

in this case, the interacting cuntz algebra becomes the cuntz algebra

{am, a

m}  {bm, b

m}/2m

(b.5)

and the innite dimensional free algebra (1.5) has corresponding simplica-
tions due to the simple forms of g and e in (b.1). we mention in particular

34

w,w

if w = uw
if w = uw
otherwise

is the simple form of the innite dimensional free-algebraic relation (1.5d) in
this case.

appendix c. composite structure of the master constraints

dene

qmwn  mgwn + imf 

n w  ifmwn + fmwn  fmwfn.

(c.1)

the master constraints (3.19a) are qmwn = 0, but one can show from (3.5)
and (3.9) that

qmwnp = qmwnb

p + bmwqnp

(c.2)

without using the constraints. (the cubic terms in  on the right simply
cancel.)

starting with the two-index qs

we may iterate (c.2) to obtain the higher-indexed qs, for example

qmn = bmb

n  emn

qmnp = qmnb

p + bmqnp

qmnpq = (qmnb

p + bmqnp)b

q + bmnqpq

(c.3)

(c.4a)

(c.4b)

and one nds more generally that all the qs are linear in qmn. it follows
that all the qs are zero when the rst one is set to zero:

bmb

n = emn  qmwn = 0

(c.5)

and so the set of master constraints (3.19a) contain no new constraints be-
yond the rst.

appendix d. identication of x()

here we will derive, by simple algebra, the functional relation between

our generating function

x = x() = xw

wxw,

x0 = 0

(d.1)

and the generating function

z(j) = xw

jw < w >,

z(0) = 1

(d.2)

of the ordinary planar parts.

start by rewriting the generator for the polynomials tw as follows

1

wtw =

xw

= (1 + x)1

1  mm + x()
1  mm(1 + x)1 = (1 + x)1xw

1

(d.3a)

jww (d.3b)

where we have made the identication

jm = m(1 + x())1

(d.4)

between the two sets of free-algebraic sources. now multiply (d.3) on the
left by mm, take the vev and use the denition xmw =< mtw > to get

xm,w

mw xmw = xm,w

jmw < mw >

which is just

combining (d.4) with (d.6) we have

x() = z(j)  1.

z(j) = 1 + x(jz(j))

or alternatively

x() = z((1 + x())1)  1.

(d.5)

(d.6)

(d.7)

(d.8)

following refs. [10, 8], the relation (d.7) identies x() as the generating
function of connected planar parts.

36

similarly, the relation [8]

z(j) = 1 + x(z(j)j)

(d.9)

is obtained by expanding (d.3) with (1 + x)1 on the right and using (5.28).

appendix e. schwinger-dyson as null state ward identities

there are many free-algebraic forms of the schwinger-dyson equations,
some of which are discussed in sec. 8. in this appendix, we discuss a form
of the schwinger-dyson equations which follows from the ward identities of
the innite-dimensional free algebra.

this development is based on the null states
(b w  gw()) | 0i = 0

which give the null state ward identities

<  w

(b w  gw()) >= 0.

(e.1)

(e.2)

to put these identities in a useful form, we leave the coupling constant-
dependent gw() terms as they are and evaluate the b w terms as follows:

<  w

gw() >=< w

b w >

= ( pww q{ui}=w/w < ui >

0 when w is not embedded in w.

(e.3a)

(e.3b)

the last form is obtained by writing b w as a product of b
each to the left using

ms and moving

[ m, b

n] = m,n | 0ih0 |,

h0 | b

m = 0.

(e.4)

this procedure shows that the average (e.3) vanishes unless the word w is
embedded in the word w, which we write as w  w. in further detail, w is
embedded in w if the two words can be written as

w = m1m2 . . . mn
w = u1m1u2m2 . . . unmnun+1

(e.5a)
(e.5b)

w  w :

37

which denes the quotient set {ui} = w/w of words ui uniquely for each
embedding.

as examples of (e.3) we list

< gw >= w,0
< mgn >= m,n
< mnpgq >= m,q < np > +n,q < m >< p > +p,q < mn >
< mgnp >= 0

(e.6a)
(e.6b)

where (e.6a) was noted in (4.3b).

appendix f. perturbation theory

we work with the dual basis system (8.8) and assume that some zeroth-

order system has already been solved

b

m + e(0)

mn((0)) bn  g(0)

m ((0)) = 0,

p = bp(1 + x (0)(b)).
(0)

(f.1)

the general perturbation problem is stated as follows. given
mn() + e
we want to solve for the corrections to the connected parts x

emn() = e(0)

gm() = g(0)

m () + g

m(),

mn()

(f.2)

x(b)  x (0)(b) =

kx (k)(b) =



xk=1



xk=1

kxw

x (k)

w b w

(f.3)

order by order in .

we have

 = (0) +  = (0) + xk=1

k bx (k)(b)

(f.4)

[e(0)

m ()  g(0)

mn((0))] bn  [g(0)

and we subtract (f.1) from (8.8a) to get the general perturbation equation
mn() bn].
mn()  e(0)
(f.5)
if we have oscillators for the zeroth-order problem, this general equa-
tion simplies somewhat. but we can work from any zeroth-order problem
and get the desired results by straightforward algebraic computation with
(f.5), remembering that the b operators serve as dummy variables, obey-
ing bmb

m ((0))] = [g

m()  e

n = m,n.
