abstract

the one loop gluon-w-meson amplitude is calculated by means of the
gauge-invariant generalized pauli-villars regularization and with the help of
dimensional regularization. it is shown that in the former case the amplitude
satises generalized ward identities, whereas in the latter case the amplitude
diers from the rst one by the constant.

introduction

an important part of the calculations of radiative corrections in the standard model
is a gauge invariant renormalization procedure. the dimensional regularization
which is mainly used for practical calculations does not preserve chiral gauge in-
variance as there is no self-consistent denition of 5 matrix in arbitrary dimension.
of course one can use for calculations noninvariant regularization as well and restore
gauge invariance of renormalized theory by adding noninvariant counterterms. how-
ever in this case to x renormalization freedom one has to use generalized ward
identities (gwi). in the case of the standard model it complicates calculations
considerably. a good illustration of this problem is a calculation of the one loop di-
agram describing the scattering of two gauge particles. this diagram is supercially
divergent but gauge invariance xes the renormalization freedom completely and
imposing on the amplitude gwi one gets unambiguous nite result. this program
was realized long ago for scattering of light by light in qed [1, 2].

in principle analogous procedure may be applied to the qcd process, for example
the gluon-w-meson amplitudes. however in this case one has to use gwi related to
the dierent gauge groups (vectorial su(3) and chiral su(2)), and contrary to the
qed case the amplitude in question is not symmetric with respect to the interchange
of all arguments. it makes the procedure quite cumbersome.

1

one may avoid those complications by using a manifestly gauge invariant pro-
cedure. in this case gwi are fullled automatically and one gets an unambiguous
result for this amplitude.

a gauge invariant regularization procedure for the standard model (generalized
pauli-villars regularization or gpv) was proposed in [3].
in the present paper
we apply this regularization to the one loop amplitude describing the transition
of two gluons to two w-mesons. we demonstrate that gpv regularization indeed
produces an unambiguous nite result which is consistent with gwi. the formal
using of the dimensional regularization with 5-matrix dened as 5 = i0123
gives the amplitude which diers from the former one by a constant.

the following calculations were carried out for the standard model. to simplify
the calculations we embed the standard model gauge group su(3)  su(2)  u(1)
into the the so(10) group.

2(1 + 11); (1,...,4) are the linear combinations of the
so(10)-matrices  which correspond to the scattering particles. since tr(11 ij kl
mn pr) = 0 the projector 1
2(1 + 11) in (4) can be replaced by 1/2. then the trace
of the product of so(10)-matrices 32  32 from (4) has the form:

tr((1)(2)(3)(4)).

(5)

to study the process w +w   gg we need the explicit form of su(2) and su(3)
generators. the su(3) generator can be chosen in the form (1) = (2) = 1
2 (6758)
and the su(2) generators can be identied with k = 1
2(ijkij  k4) (see [3]). in
the standard model mesons w  are the combinations of su(2)-gauge elds w 1,2,3:
w  = (w 1  iw 2)/2, and thus (1,2) = (1  2)/2. in the loop we are taking

into account the contribution of the following virtual spinors only: e, e, d, u. with
the help of the s algebra :

[ij, kl] = i(iljk  ikjl + jkil  jlik).

(6)

and keeping in mind the last remark it was calculated that the expression in (5)
equals to 1.

the contribution of the pauli-villars elds r, r is more complicated due to the

presence of the propagators: sr,r,+(k), sr,+r,(k), sr,r,+

(k), sr,+r,(k).

if the propagators (2) are denoted as s, and propagators (3)  as s then contri-
butions of the pauli-villars elds can be of four types: ssss, s ss s, ss s s, s s s s.
these contributions are denoted respectively as: i (r,1,), i (r,2,), i (r,3,), i (r,4,). sum
of all these contributions is denoted as i (r,) (r  1): i (r,)

one may note that the term, proportional to 11 vanishes, and i (r,+) = i (r,). the
expression for the i (0) in (4) is the particular case of the i (r,+) (when r = 0).

for explicit calculations feynman parametrization is used:  +  +  +  = 1,

and the integration over the feynman parameters is dened as follows:

for simplicity integration variable in the (k(1), k(2), k(3), k(4)) is shifted:

p  p  (k(1) + (k(1) + k(2)) + (k(1) + k(2) + k(3))),

w  k(1) + (k(1) + k(2)) + (k(1) + k(2) + k(3))

thus i (r)

(1, 2, 3, 4) can be rewritten in the form:

after this shift, the terms in the numerator proportional to p and p3 may be omitted.
the denominator can be represented as:

(p2 + (k(1))2 + (k(2))2 + (k(3))2 + (k(4))2
(k(1) + k(2))(k(3) + k(4))  (k(1) + k(4))(k(2) + k(3))  m 2

regularized expression for the feynman diagram shown at fig.1 looks as follows:

(1, 2, 3, 4) = i (0)

(1, 2, 3, 4) +

(1)r(cid:16)i (r,+)

(1, 2, 3, 4) + i (r,)

(1, 2, 3, 4)(cid:17).

(18)
the integrands can be represented as linear combinations of the following expres-
sions:

+

xr=

r0,2,4(1)r

(p2  m 2r2 + f )4 ,

which can be rewritten as derivatives of

following equation holds:

(20)

qm 2(p2 + f ) sin(q(p2 + f )/m 2)

since after the wick rotation p2 + f becomes negative, one sees that integrand of
 is proportional to:



mq|p2 + f|sinh(q|p2 + f|/m)

5

.

(21)

this expression decreases rapidly providing the regularization. but eq. (21) is too
complicated for further calculations.

equation (21) arises after summation of contributions of an innie series of pv
elds. the necessity to introduce an innite system of pv elds is due to the fact
that these elds belong to the 32-dimensional representation of so(10) and they
contribute to the amplitude under consideration both i (r,+) and i (r,) whereas the
original elds  contribute only i (0,+). for this reason as was discussed in ref. [3], a
nite number of pv elds does not allow to satisfy the pv conditions providing the
convergence of regularized amplitude. to construct a lagrangian gauge invariant
regularization for the standard model with odd number of generations an innite
set of pv elds is needed. however being interested in the calculation of a partic-
ular four-point amplitude we can omit the terms i (r,) without spoiling the gauge
invariance. (as for this amplitude i (r,) = i (r,+) it corresponds to replacing the de-
terminant which arise after integration over the pv elds by the square root of the
determinant.) then to regularize the model it is sucient to take a nite number
of pv elds (r=1).

so instead of (18) the following formula for  may be used:

(1, 2, 3, 4) = i (0)

(1, 2, 3, 4)  i (1,+)

(1, 2, 3, 4).

(22)

to illustrate this statement let us note that the integrand of the dierence be-
tween (18) and (22) is proportional to the following:

z

+

xr=

(1)r

(p2 + f  m 2  m 2r2)4 ,

(23)

thus the dierence between (18) and (22) tends to zero when pauli-villars mass
m  , and the gauge invariance is preserved.
grams at fig. 1, . . . , 6, which dier by permutations of w +, w  and g:

the complete four-point function g is the sum of s corresponding to the dia-

g(k(1), k(2), k(3), k(4)) =

(1, 2, 3, 4) + (1, 2, 4, 3) + (1, 3, 2, 4) +

(24)

+ (1, 4, 3, 2) + (1, 3, 4, 2) + (1, 4, 2, 3).

below we demonstrate that this amplitude satises generalized ward identities

and in the limit m   leads to a nite gauge invariant expression.

the gwi for the four-point function g(k(1), k(2), k(3), k(4)) look as follows:

k(1)

 g(k(1), k(2), k(3), k(4)) +ha(k(1)), g(k(1), k(2), k(3), k(4))i = 0,

k(2)

 g(k(1), k(2), k(3), k(4)) +ha(k(2)), g(k(1), k(2), k(3), k(4))i = 0,

they are more complicated than in qed and in general their analysis is quite
cumbersome. however for the fourth order amplitude we are considering, the terms
proportional to a do not contribute and the gwi acquire a simple form:

etc. (25)

k(1)
 g(1, 2, 3, 4) = 0,

k(2)
 g(1, 2, 3, 4) = 0,

etc.

(26)

6

these identities dier from qed only by the absence of symmetry with respect to the
interchange of the momenta. moreover, one can show that the fourth order fermion
loop diagram have to satisfy the eq. (26) also in the model with spontaneously
broken symmetry, when the fermions acquire nonzero masses. in principle gwi in
this case will include a contribution of the higgs elds, but for the diagram under
consideration this contribution vanishes.

for this reason in the following we consider a general case when the fermions are

massive. the physical fermion propagator looks as follows:

s  =

k  m
(k2  m2)

,

(27)

and the interaction vertices include the chiral projector.

one can note that i(k(i), k(j), k(k), k(l)) = i(k(i),k(j),k(k),k(l)). thus terms
proportional to tr(5 . . .) in g cancel in pairs identically. for example, such contri-
butions into i (1, 4, 3, 2) and i(1, 2, 3, 4) cancel each other:

tr(5(p + k(1)  m)(p + k(1) + k(4)  m)(p + k(1) + k(4) + k(3)  m)(p  m)) =
= tr(5(p k(1) + m)(p k(1)  k(2) + m)(p k(1)  k(2)  k(3) + m)(p + m))
thus the expression for this four-point function g is equal to the expression for
the four-point function in non-chiral theory multiplied by 1/2. therefore one ex-
pects that the fourth order scattering amplitude calculated with the use of gpv
regularization is gauge invariant.

by gpv regularization.

comparison with the results of the dimensional
regularization

it was shown in [4] that there is no self-consistent denition of 5-matrix in arbitrary
dimension, and some assumptions are needed for dealing with 5. let us assume

that 5 = i0123 in arbitrary dimension d, and then {5, } = 0 when   3,
[5, ] = 0 for others . the properties of 0, 1, . . . are standard: {, } = 2g,

since only potentially divergent part of i needs regularization, only the integrals
of the following form should be examined:

interested in comparison of the dimensional regularization with the gpv, indices

let us begin with (32). index  always runs from 0 to 3 since there is a factor

3) ,   4, . . ., ,

in the fourth case integration over p leads to the result:

there are six contributions into g which dier by permutations. one can note
that f (, , , , 1, 2, 3, 4, m2)  0 and symmetric with respect to simultaneous per-
mutations:   ,   , and k(2)  k(4). thus there are only three dierent f s
appear in calculations. let us denote them as f 1,2,3: f 1  f (, , , , 1, 2, 3, 4, m2);
f 2  f 1|k(3)k(4) ; f 3  f 1|k(2)k(3) .
keeping in mind the symmetry properties one can write down the contribution
of all potentially divergent parts into g:

this result diers from the correct one by the constant 22

this fact is illustrated at fig.7, where m = 1; k(1) = (3, 0, 0, 3); k(2) =
(3, 0, 2 sin(), 2 cos()); k(3) = (3, 0, 0,3); k(4) = (3, 0,2 sin(),2 cos());  =

this dierence is due to the presence of exactly two projectors in the traces
in equations (32),(33), because the gluons are transformed by the vectorial su(3)
group, whereas w mesons are transformed the chiral su(2) groups. the correct
result can be recovered with the help of gwi, introducing the nite counterterm.

hence a straightforward application of the dimensional regularization with 5

dened as above breaks gauge invariance of the model.

discussion

the comparison of dierent regularizations methods for the four-point function is
carried out. the contribution of the spinor loop to the four-point function for
w +w   gg transition in the standard model is examined by means of the gener-
alized pauli-villars regularization, dimensional regularization and with the help of
generalized ward identities.

it is found that gpv regularization and renormalization with the help of the
gwi give correct result, whereas inconsistency in the denition of 5-matrix in the
framework of the dimensional regularization leads to the result, which diers from
the correct one by a constant.

for the diagram we considered, all three methods require a comparable amount
of work. however for more complicated diagrams the manifestly gauge invariant
gpv regularization seems to be preferable.
