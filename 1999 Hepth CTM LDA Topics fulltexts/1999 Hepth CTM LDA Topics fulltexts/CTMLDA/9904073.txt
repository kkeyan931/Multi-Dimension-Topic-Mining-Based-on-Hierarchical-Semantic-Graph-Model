introduction among ads/cft dualities {$9711200$} case ads3/cf t2 distiguished generically one better control sides correspondence. one side, one deals 2d superconformal eld theories (scft) quite extensively studied. side, one three-dimensional ads gravity quite simple itself. addition, near-horizon limit generically involves (after suitable dualities) exact wzw models various parts make near-horizon conguration, one go beyond supergravity approximation considering string theory ads3{$9806194$}. thus quite natural try fully explore cases hopefully learn lessons higher dimensional cases well. end one try formulate correspondence setting much control theory possible. happen either dealing theory little structure, like free fermion, theory large symmetry group. paper follow second route. study correspondence case boundary superconformal theory maximal possible linearly realized symmetry, i.e. symmetry algebra large (or double) n = 4 superconformal algebra . algebra contains two commuting ane dsu(2) lie algebras (in contrast, small n = 4 algebra contains one ane dsu(2) lie algebra). also contains nite dimensional superalgebra d1(2, 1, /(1 )). conformal models symmetry algebra characterized two integers, two levels k+ k two ane dsu(2) algebras ( = k/(k++k)). one might expect models would easy analyze large amount symmetry. however, turns case structure superconformal algebra quite non-trivial. supersymmetric theories analysis bps sector theory usually tractable. instance, theories n = 2 small n = 4 symmetry algebra linear relation conformal

large n limit number branes certain types always becomes large. talk 1/n corrections later sections clear context meant n . 2 possibility states satisfy bound supergravity cease string theory. addition, bps states form ring (but may form module ring). ads/cft dual pairs obtained considering conguration branes taking limit decoupled worldvolume theory obtained. limit time near-horizon limit corresponding supergravity conguration. near-horizon isometry superalgebra becomes worldvolume superconformal algebra. brane conguration leads dual superconformal theory symmetry algebra identied . consists non-standard intersection two m5 branes m2 brane. near-horizon limit geometry contains ads3 s3 s3. isometry groups two spheres become r-symmetry su(2)s, radii spheres related levels dsu(2)s. brane congurations near- horizon limit exist string theories. particular, iib string theory conguration leads geometry consists overlap two d1-d5 systems (similarly m-theory conguration may thought overlap two m2-m5 systems). near-horizon limit case m-branes standard low-energy limit. case iib branes, however, one needs consider ultra-low energy limit. another motivation studying system viewed master conguration one reach systems involving near-horizon limit factor ads2 ads3 one two factors s2 and/or s3 either adding branes and/or taking appropriate limits . therefore, complete understanding ads3 s3 s3 conguration may lead unied picture cases well. paper begin detailed analysis ads3 s3 s3/a duality. previous work found {$9711200$}. one aims identify dual superconformal

latter needed make conformal eld theory well-dened. alternative description obtained exchanging roles k+ k. start analysis studying supergravity solutions. rst problem one encounters near-horizon

conformal eld theory. main question single multiparticle states correspond chiral states boundary scft. non- linearity bps bound dicult question, especially since non-linearity invisible supergravity. consider various possible answers question discuss ones consistent mentioned proposal candidate boundary scft. notice verify directly single multiparticle states actually massive would need calculate 1/n corrections bps bound contains terms subleading 1/n. another way obtain information boundary superconformal theory use d-brane perturbation theory. boundary theory infrared limit worldvolume gauge
