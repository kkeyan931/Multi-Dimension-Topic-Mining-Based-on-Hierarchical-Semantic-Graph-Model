abstract

we calculate the equal-time commutator of two fermionic currents within
the framework of the 1+1 dimensional fully quantized theory, describing the
interaction of massive fermions with a massive vector boson. it is shown that
the interaction does not change the result obtained within the theory of free
fermions.

i. introduction

when quantizing the fermionic currents there occur additional terms in the equal-time
(e.t.) commutators, so called schwinger terms. they can be determined by dierent meth-
ods, for instance perturbatively, see e.g. [1]-[4] or cohomologically [5,6], and they have an
important impact on the theory [1].

schwinger terms are also closely related to the anomalies of qft (for an overview see
[7]). whereas anomalies do not get altered by considering quantized gauge elds (due to the
adler-bardeen theorem [8]) this is less clear for the schwinger terms (st). therefore it is our
aim to investigate st in a full quantized theory. we will work in a 1+1 dimensional qft
describing the interaction of fermions with a massive vector eld. there all calculations can
be performed explicitly and it is a natural continuation of the work [9], where the case of
the free fermions was discussed.

the fact that all elds are quantized distinguishes this work from others where the similar
calculations were done for the theories describing fermions interacting with external elds
(see e.g. [10]-[12] and the references given there).

the paper is organized as follows.

there is one exception (known to the author) [13], where boson eld is quantized too,
but fermions are considered as massless and the used procedure is quite dierent - from the
begining the currents are dened as the composite operators via the point-splitting method.
in section 2 we start with the denition of the
interacting current j 
1 introduced by bogoliubov [14] in the framework of the formalism
int
of epstein and glaser [15] which is explained in detail and extensively used in the book of
scharf [16]. using this denition we derive the explicit form of j 
int in the considered two
dimensional eld theory model. the calculation of the commutator is done in section 3. in
the appendix we rigorously show that in the case of our model, the formalism of epstein
and glaser is equivalent to the ordinary one using the t -product (time-ordered product).

ii. definition of the interacting current

following bogoliubov [14] and scharf [16] we dene

j (x)  s 1(g)

,

(2.1)

s(g)

ig(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)g=0

where the s-matrix s and its inverse s 1 are expressed in perturbative form as

s(g) 1 +

ei

i! (n  i)!





n

xi=0

xn=1
z t 1,...,ni

n

(x1, . . . , xn)g1(xi+1) . . . gni(xn) d2x1 . . . d2xn

(2.2)

1label int is to emphasize that the operator is not a composite operator.

 1 + t,



n

s 1(g) 1 +

i! (n  i)!

xi=0

xn=1
z t 1,...,ni

n

(x1, . . . , xn)g1(xi+1) . . . gni(xn) d2x1 . . . d2xn,

(2.4)

where e is the coupling constant of the interaction between fermions and bosons and gi (x) is
a c-number test functions from s (r2) (schwartz space). properties of t 1,...,ni
(x1, . . . , xn)
are xed by the required properties of s (see [16]).

n

from the equation

we get

s(g)1 = (1 + t )1 = 1+



xr=1

(t )r

tn(x) =

n

xr=1

()rxpr

tn1 (x1) . . . tnr (xr) ,

(2.5)

(2.6)

where the second sum runs over all partitions pr of x = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} into r disjoint
non-empty subsets.

for the meaningful denition of our eld theory model we have to dene the rst order

terms of (2.2)

where

s(1)(g)  iz {et1(x) + g(x)t 

1 (x)} d2x,

t1(x) = : (x)6a(x) : ,
t 
1 (x) = : (x)(x) : .

(2.7)

(2.8)
(2.9)

the elds (x) and (x) represent both fermion and antifermion and the a is a vector
boson eld. all elds appearing in (2.8) and (2.9) are free since we work with a perturbation
expansion. the masses of the particles we denote

m() = m,
ma = .

note that we use the model containing a massive vector eld in order to avoid problems
with infrared singularities.

using (2.1) and (2.2) we derive

j (x) = j 

f ree(x) +

i



xn=1

1

n! z a

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; x) d2x1 . . . d2xn,

(2.10)

where

and a

n+1 is the so-called advanced (n + 1)-point function

j 
f ree(x) =: (x)(x) :

a

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; x) = xp 0

2

tm (x/y ) t 

nm (y, x) ,

(2.11)

(2.12)

means the summation over all partitions of the set x including the empty subset

where pp 0

2

x/y = 6 0. the label advanced means that the support of a

n+1 is

supp a

n+1(x1, x2, . . . , xn; x)  

n+1 (x) ,

where

i.e. the a

n+1 vanish if an arbitrary x0

i is greater then x0.



n+1 (x)  (cid:8){xi}n

i=1| (xi  x)2  0, x0

i  x0(cid:9) ,

for the reason which will become clear later we rewrite (2.12) in the form

a

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; x) = x

where

 (x, xi1, . . . , xin) cn (x, xi1, xi2, . . . , xin) ,

(2.13)

cn (x, xi1, xi2, . . . , xin) = [. . . [[t 

1 (x) , t1 (xi1)] , t1 (xi2)] . . . , t1 (xin)]

(2.14)

 (x, xi1, . . . , xin) = (cid:0)x0  x0

i1(cid:1) (cid:0)x0

i1  x0

i2(cid:1) . . . (cid:0)x0

in1  x0
in(cid:1)

and the summation runs over all permutations of the elements of x. (the advancing of
the support is then evident.)

combining (2.10) and (2.13) we get

j (x) =

1
i



xn=0

enj 

n (x),

where

f ree(x) = t 

0 (x) = ij 
j 
n (x) = z  (x, x1, x2, . . . , xn) cn (x, x1, x2, . . . , xn) d2x1d2x2 . . . d2xn.

1 (x)

j 

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

nevertheless the denition (2.1) has to be slightly modied if we (naturally) require that

the vacuum expectation value of the interacting current j (x) be equal to zero.

our redenition is then straightforward

j 
int(x)  j (x)  h0| j (x) |0i

iii. commutator of interacting currents

now we are ready to calculate the commutator of two interacting currents. using (2.18)

we write

[j 

int(x), j 

int(y)]e.t. = [j (x), j (y)]e.t. = 



xn=0

en

n

xi=0 (cid:2)j 

i (x), j 

ni(y)(cid:3) .

and according to formulae (2.17), (2.14) and due to the fact [17] that

a

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; x)  a

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; y) =

n

= xi1...in

xk=0

we nally get

1

k! (n  k)! (cid:2)a

n+1(xi1, . . . , xik ; x), a

n+1(xik+1, . . . , xin; y)(cid:3)

[j 

int(x), j 

int(y)]e.t. =

= 



xn=0

enz  (x, x1, x2, . . . , xn) 
1 (x) , t 

 [. . . [[t 

1 (y)]e.t. , t1 (x1)] . . . , t1 (xn)] d2x1d2x2 . . . d2xn.

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

however, it turns out that only the rst term in the sum contributes. to see this, one has
to realize that the operator relation

[t 

1 (x) , t 

1 (y)]e.t.  1

(3.4)

is valid. indeed, using wick theorem we express [t 
ordered products

1 (x) , t 

1 (y)] in terms of the normally

[t 

1 (x) , t 

1 (y)] = i : (y)s (y  x) (x) :  i : (x)s (x  y) (x) : +

+ tr(cid:8)s() (x  y) s(+) (y  x)   s() (y  x) s(+) (x  y) (cid:9) .

(3.5)

in the equal-time limit we have

and because in the 1+1 dimensions the identity

s (x  y) |e.t. = 0(cid:0)x1  y1(cid:1)

0 = 0

5

(3.6)

(3.7)

holds, the relation (3.4) is proved2.

thus, we can conclude that no contribution from the interaction appears, i.e.

[j 

int(x), j 

int(y)]e.t. = [j 

0 (x), j 

0 (y)]e.t.

(3.9)

this is the main result of the article.

as the author has checked the same result can be obtained in the bosonization scheme
[19]. moreover, it can be shown that the work [13] (where m = 0) for the model considered
here leads, in fact, to the same answer. therefore a connection between these approaches
and our scheme might exist.

iv. conclusion

we have calculated the commutator of interacting currents in the simple two-dimensional
model describing the interaction of fermions with a massive vector eld. we have shown
that the interaction does not change the result obtained within the theory of free fermions.
a similar result we also expect to occur in 3+1 dimensions, however, the same calculations
cannot be carried out in the same way in the 3+1 dimensions because the equality

xp 0

2

tm (x/y ) t 

nm (y, x) = x

 (x, x1, . . . , xn) cn (x, x1, . . . , xn)

(4.1)

is no longer valid.

taking the limit   0 for the vector eld would lead to problems because of the
infrared singularities. nevertheless these singularities do not preclude the possibility to split
the causal distributions using multiplication by theta-functions. therefore one may guess
that the relation (3.9) remains valid even in the limit   0.

the other types of couplings (e.g. chiral or axial) are under consideration within the
framework of our formalism. the results might then be compared (in the limit m = 0) with
those of the [13].

in view of the intimate connection between schwinger terms and anomaly, our result
naturally suggests another (open) question concerning its possible relation to the adler-
bardeen theorem. however, a general proof that quantized gauge elds do not change the
result of the external elds is still missing.

2here we are working with normal ordered operators, which are well-dened in fock space. there-
fore we can indeed write

i : (y) s (y  x) (x) : i : (x)s (x  y)  (x) : |e.t. = 0,

(3.8)

i.e. rhs of (3.8) is not given as the dierence of two innities [18].

appendix: the transition step

to justify the transition from (2.12) to (2.13) we introduce the distribution d

n+1

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; x)  r

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; x)  a

n+1(x1, . . . , xn; x),

it is possible to show that

n+1 (x) ,

where

n+1 (x)  (cid:8){xi}n

and therefore d

n+1 has a causal support, i.e.

supp d

n+1 (x, x)  +

n+1 (x)  

n+1 (x) .

it is clear that if d

n+1 is not singular then a

n+1 can be expressed as

however, as it was shown in [16] the splitting of an arbitrary distribution with the
causal support to retarded and advanced part via multiplication by the combination of
theta-functions, i.e. (a.6) is not generally a well dened procedure.

terms ti1 . . . tik, ij  {1, . . . , n}, pk

the reason why we can do it here is that we work in two dimensions. we show that the
j=1 ij = n + 1,which are sitting in dn+1, are correctly
dened and they have non singular behavior. the last enables their multiplication by the
combination of the theta-functions.

every term ti1 . . . tik is expressible as a sum of terms of the normally ordered operators

(graphs) of the form

ti1 . . . tik

 xk

t gk
n+1(x1, . . . , xn, x)

where

t g
n (x1, . . . , xn) =:

nf

yi=1

(xkj )tg (x1, . . . , xn)

nf

yi=1

(xnj ) ::

nb

yi=1

a(cid:0)xmj(cid:1) :

(a.16)

(a.17)

and nf is the number of external fermions (or antifermions), nb the number of the external
massive bosons and tg (x1, . . . , xn) is c-number distribution.

in the dimension d the graph g (a.17) has the singular order

 (g) = n(cid:18) d

2

 2(cid:19) + d  nb(cid:18)d

2

 1(cid:19)  nf (d  1)

and for d = 2 we get

 (g) = 2  n  nf .

(a.18)

(a.19)

we see that the problematic (singular) case  (g)  0 can appear only for n = 2. all
higher-order graphs do not contain any singularity. moreover the c-number distribution in
the 2-point causal function has really  (g) = 2. this all means that all graphs (including
their subgraphs) are not singular, the terms ti1 . . . tik are well-dened and can be multiplied
by the combination of theta-functions.

therefore the formula (2.13) is consistent with (2.12).
