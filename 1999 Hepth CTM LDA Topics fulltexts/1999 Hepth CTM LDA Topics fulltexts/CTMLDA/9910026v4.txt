thermodynamics of fateevs models in the presence of external fields

department of physics, university of oxford, 1 keble road, oxford, ox1 3np, uk

davide controzzi and alexei m. tsvelik

(october 20, 2013)

we study the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations for a one-parameter quantum eld theory
recently introduced by v.a.fateev. the presence of chemical potentials produces a kink condensate
that modies the excitation spectrum. for some combinations of the chemical potentials an addi-
tional gapless mode appears. various energy scales emerge in the problem. an eective eld theory,
describing the low energy excitations, is also introduced.

pacs numbers: 11.10-z;71.10-w; 74.20de.

i. introduction

recently v.a.fateev introduced a series of two dimensional integrable deformations of ane toda theories pos-
sessing the property of duality1,2. these models exist in two incarnations - fermionic and bosonic - and the strong
coupling limit of one incarnation corresponds to the weak coupling limit of the other one. apart from being amusing
examples of integrable eld theories, these models may have some interesting physical applications35.

in this paper we consider in some details one of the simplest models of that family. the lagrangian density of the

fermionic version of the theory is given by:

l(f ) = xs=1,2hi ss 
m0 11e1  m0 22e2 

g
2

1

( ss)2i +

2(cid:2)(1)2 + (2)2(cid:3) 
22 h2e(21) + e21 + e22i

m 2
0

(1)

where g = 2/(4 + 2) and we can identify two types of fermions 1,2 and two coupled toda chains described by
the bosonic elds 1,2.

in the bosonic representation the phonon modes, 1,2, disappear and the lagrangian density is :

l(b) =

1

2

xs=1

s s

1 + (/2)2s s 

m 2
0
2

[1 1 + 2 2 + 2/2(1 1)(2 2)]

where the coupling constants of the two models are connected by the duality relation:

 = 4/

(2)

(3)

as we have mentioned above, the weak coupling limit of the bosonic theory,  << 1 (1  g << 1), correspond to the
strong coupling limit of the fermionic one,  >> 1.
the bosonic form of the model is particularly interesting because the euclidean version of the theory can be
interpreted as ginzburg-landau free energy of two coupled superconductors. we shall discuss this application in
greater details later in the text as well as in a separate publication.

models (1),(2) have u(1)u(1) symmetry and the corresponding conserved charges are given by

qs =z dx s0s = 

i

2z dx

( s0s  s0 s)
[1 + (/2)2s s]

thus one can introduce two chemical potentials and modify the hamiltonian:

h  h  h1q1  h2q2

(4)

(5)

the u(1)u(1) symmetry of the hamiltonian reects in the symmetry of the particle multiplets. in absence of
chemical potentials the spectrum of the model consists of fundamental particles carrying quantum numbers of u(1)
groups and their neutral bound states. the two-body scattering matrix of fundamental particles is given by a tensor
product of two sine-gordon s-matrices multiplied by a cdd-factor responsible for cancellation of double poles:

1

s12() = 

sinh   i sin(/)
sinh  + i sin(/)

s(; )  s(; )

where the s(, ) is the soliton scattering matrix of the sine-gordon model with

 = 2  g = 1 +

s a,b

ab (; ) = ei()(cid:26)aabb(cid:20)ab + (1  ab)

to derive thermodynamic equations we start from the discrete bethe ansatz equations which emerge when the

system is put in a box of size l with periodic boundary conditions:

s(j  k)(a1, ...an)

eim sinh j l(a1, ...an) = yk6=j
xj=1

e = m

n

cosh j

(9)

(10)

where (a1, ...an) is the wave function of n fundamental particles in the isotopic space. the matrix on the right-hand
side of eq.(9) is related to the trace of the monodromy matrix  :

s(j  k) = tr ( = j; 1, ...n)

yk6=j

(11)

up to the scalar factor given by the product of cdd-factors the latter matrix is equal to a tensor product of monodromy
matrices of the sine-gordon models:

the eigenvalues of the sine-gordon monodromy matrix are known, hence it is straightforward to write down (9) in

 (, 1, ...n) =  (1)(, 1, ...n)   (2)(, 1, ...n)

where:

the numbers m are related to the conserved charges q1,2. as we shall demonstrate later

m =

[n  (q1  q2)]

(16)

(17)

the simplicity of this formula cannot obscure its remarkable meaning: propagating particles are superpositions of
states localized on dierent edges of the stripe. this result is valid for other fateevs models where the toda array
consists of more than two elastic chains.

ii. thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) equations

in order to construct the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) equations from (13,14,15) we consider the case
1  g = 1/, with integer   2, where the complex solutions of these equations (the strings) have the simplest
classication. for most of the results the fact that  is an integer is not important and one can generalize them for
arbitrary g > 1/2 replacing  by (1  g)1.
to save space and make our notations more transparent we shall sometimes denote the kernels in the integral
equations directly in terms of their fourier transforms. for example, the convolution of two functions g and f with
the function g having fourier transform g() will be written as:

z +



dg(  )f () = g  f () = {g()}  f

(18)

thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) equations have been introduced in1,4. the free energy of the system is expressed
in terms of the excitation energies en():

f/l = txn

mnz d

2

cosh  ln[1 + een()/t ]

(19)

in the specic case (1),(2) we have only one bound state with energy e1, and the fundamental particle with energy

e0. the function e1 satises the following equation :

t ln[1 + ee1()/t ]  g11  t ln[1 + ee1()/t ] = m1 cosh 
+g10  t ln[1 + ee0()/t ],

and is directly coupled only to e0, which is determined by the equation:

t ln(1 + ee0()/t )  k+  t ln[1 + ee0()/t ] = m cosh  

h+ + h

2

+g10  t ln[1 + ee1()/t ]  t s  ln[(1 + e1()/t )(1 + e1()/t )]

the two masses are related by:

and the fourier transform of the kernel is:

m1 = 2m sin[/2(2  g)]

k+ = ksym + 2a1  s = 1 +

tanh[/2( + 1)] sinh[(  1)/2( + 1)]

cosh(/2)

where ksym is related to the two-particle scattering phase :

and its fourier trasform is:

the equations for n and n are:

 = h/2  s  t ln[1 + e(2)/t ]

n= n,1h/2 + s  t ln[1 + en1/t ][1 + en+1/t ]
+ 2,ns  t ln[1 + e /t ] + n,1s  t ln[1 + ee0/t ]

 = h+/2  s  t ln[1 + e(2)/t ]

n = n,1h+/2 + s  t ln[1 + en1/t ][1 + en+1/t ]
+ 2,ns  t ln[1 + e /t ] + n,1s  t ln[1 + ee0/t ]

the fourier transforms of the remaining kernels have the form:

s() = [2 cosh[/2(1  g)]]1

g11() =

4 sinh(g/2) sinh[(1  g)/]

sinh(/2)

cosh[(  1)/2] sinh[/2]

cosh(/2)



g10() =

2 sinh(g/2) sinh[(1  g)/2]

cosh(/2)

where  is dened in (7) and can be also expressed as  = 1 + 1.

the subsequent analysis will show that the elds h are linear combinations of the chemical potentials h1,2

h = h1  h2

(30)

(recall eq.(17)).

iii. properties of the ground state

in this section we consider the zero temperature limit of the tba equations. we assume that the elds h are

strong enough to make e0 negative in some interval [b, b]. then it is obvious from eq.(20) that e1 > 0:

e1 = m1 cosh   g01  e()
from eqs.(27,29)we deduce that all n with n 6=  are also positive:
0  an,2s  ()

n = a1  e()

0

 + (n  1)h

where

anm() = 2 coth 

sinh[(  max(n, m))] sinh[min(n, m)]

an() =

sinh[(  n)]

sinh 

,  =

substituting eq.(32) into eq.(26,28) we get the equations for :

shall consider only two special cases: a) h+ << h; b) h+  h.

since (+)

0 = m cosh   h/2

iv. the limit of free bosons

to check the validity of tba equations (20-29) and establish the connection between the elds h and the chemical
potentials h1,2 we consider the free boson limit of the tbas. it is realized in the case g  1 or 1  0. in this case
the kernels in eqs.(26-29) become proportional to the delta functions

and k+  i, g11 = g01  0, such that all tba equations become algebraic. the mass of the bound state in this
limit is m1 = 2m and the free energy is equal to:

s() 

1
2

()

f/l = 

t m

2 z d cosh  ln(cid:26)h1 + ee1/ti2h1 + ee0/ti(cid:27)

the solution of tba equations is expressed in terms of  = m cosh /t :

1 + ee1/t = (1  e2)1

1 + en/t =(cid:20) sinh(hn + a)/2t

sinh h/2t

(cid:21)2

sinh a/2t
sinh h/2t

=p1 + ee0/t

where

substituting this into eq.(21) we get

ncosh(h+/2t )p1 + ee0/t + [cosh2(h+/2t ) + sinh2(h+/2t )ee0/t ]1/2o

7

(54)

(55)

(56)

(57)

ncosh(h/2t )p1 + ee0/t + [cosh2(h/2t ) + sinh2(h/2t )ee0/t ]1/2o = ee0/t

which has the following solution:

1 + ee0/t =

(cosh   cosh(h+/2t ) cosh(h/2t ))2  sinh(h+/2t ) sinh(h/2t )

sinh2 

combining it with (55) in the free energy, we get

f/l = 

t

2 z dm cosh  ln(f )

sinh2 

(cosh   cosh(h+/2t ) cosh(h/2t ))2  sinh2(h+/2t ) sinh2(h/2t )

f = (1  e2)2

(58)

(59)

(60)

(61)

=n[1  e(h++h)/2t ][1  e+(h++h)/2t ][1  e(h+h)/2t ][1  e+(h+h)/2t ]o1

the free boson limit of tbas (20-29) does reproduce the free energy of two non interacting complex bosonic elds.
this indicates that the tba equations are correct. another important result is the conrmation of eqs.(17,30).

v. semiclassical analysis of the limit of small 

let us consider the euclidean form of the lagrangian (2). rescaling the elds, s  (/2)s, it becomes:

l(b) =

2

2 " 2
xs=1

s s
1 + s s

+ m 2(cid:8)1 1 + 2 2 + 2(1 1)(2 2)(cid:9)#

(62)

then in the limit   0 the quantum uctuations are suppressed and one can approximate the ground state energy
as minimum of the functional

e(s, hs) =

2

2 "m 2(cid:8)1 1 + 2 2 + 2(1 1)(2 2)(cid:9)  xs=1,2

hss s

1 + s s# .

(63)

we will not address this problem, already studied by fateev1, but we will use this approximation to to get more insight
to the problem and give an intuitive picture of the low energy physics. let us perform the following transformation
in the form (62):

s = sinh seis

(64)

under this transformation the measure transform in dd sinh(2) and the lagrangian density in the new elds in
presence of chemical potentials assume the form:

l(b) =

2

2{xs=1,2

[(s)2 + tanh2 s(s)2  hs tanh2 s0s]
+m 2[sinh2 1 + sinh2 2 + 2 sinh2 1 sinh2 2]}

for h1 = h and h2 = 0, which corresponds to the situation b in section iii, we get:

l(b) =

2
2{(1)2 + tanh2 1[(1)2  h01] + (2)2 +
tanh2 2(2)2 + m 2(sinh2 1 + sinh2 2 + 2 sinh2 1 sinh2 2)}

the term h(01) can be absorbed by the shift:

8

(65)

(66)

1  1  (h/2)t

which generate also an additional term h2/4. then the lagrangian density becomes:
2
2{(1)2 + (2)2 + tanh2 1(1)2 + tanh2 2(2)2 + v b

l(b) =

ef f (1, 2)}

where:

and

ef f (1, 2) = v1(1) + m 2 sinh2 2 + 2m 2 sinh2 1 sinh2 2
v b

v1(1) = m 2 sinh2 1  h2/4 tanh2 1

ef f (1, 2) has a minimum at 1 = 0 and 2 = 0 where exp 20 = 8(h/m ). in the vicinity of the

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

for h/2 > m , v b
minimum we have:

which gives the masses going like hm , in accordance with (53).

vef f (1 = 0 + x, 2 = y)  hm (2y2 + 8x2)

(71)

thus when the chemical potential exceeds the threshold the kinks condense and gapless goldstone mode appear.
to see this explicitly we write 1 = 0 + x and keeping only quadratic terms in x obtain the following expression for
the lagrangian:

l(b) 

2
2{(x)2 + (m h/2)x2 + tanh2 0(1)2 +
(2)2 + tanh2 2(2)2 + sinh2 2h/m}

(72)

here we can identify a gapless mode 1 with velocity equal to the bare one, a gapful eld x with the mass m2
and an eective integrable eld theory described by the lagrangian density:

x = hm/2

l2 =

1
2

(

2


)2{m sinh2 2 + (2)2 + tanh2 2(2)2}

in the case h1  h2 corresponding to the situation a) of section iii, the eective potential acquires the form:

ef f (1, 2) = v1(1) + v1(2) + 2m 2 sinh2 1 sinh2 2
v a

(73)

(74)

repeating the same analysis one nds two independent gapless modes with the same velocity. then the semiclassical
approximation gives a correct qualitative description of the low energy behavior of the system. as a byproduct we
obtain another conrmation of (30).

vi. low energy physics: massless modes and energy scales

let us go back to the zero temperature limit described in section iii. as we have shown, in the case h1  h2 there
are two soft modes: e0 and . at || < b the mode  closely follows e0; at|| >> b its behavior is determined
by the asymptotics (37) and this mode becomes independent. the temperature scale below which the two modes
decouple can be determined by the value of of  at   b:
tsep  ()

(75)

(b)



for low temperatures, t < tsep, the two modes give independent contribution to the thermodynamics. to calculate
the low temperature free energy:

we use the eqs. (36,42) which at nite temperature have the form:

f/l = 

t
2

mz d cosh  ln[1 + ee0()/t ]

(76)

9

t ln(1 + ee0/t )  k  t ln(1 + ee0/t ) = m cosh

2 (cid:26)

2 cosh(  1)(cid:27)  t ln(1 + e /t )
h+
2  a

where a is dened in eq.(37). to isolate the contributions that vanish at t=0 we rewrite (77) like:

0 + k  e()
e(+)

0 + (i  k)  t ln(1 + e|e0|/t ) = r.h.s. of eq.(77)

where i is the identity operator. using eq.(47) we can rewrite the free energy as:

where

f/l = 

t

0 + t ln(1 + e|e0|/t ))  f0 + f

f0 = tz d() ln(1 + e|e0|/t )  2t 2/3vc

f = tz d(cid:26)

the velocities of the two modes are determined by :

(81)

(82)

(83)

(84)

for large b all the quantities appearing in these equations can be calculated using the wiener-hopf solutions obtained
in section iii via the following relations:

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

()/d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=b

()/d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

()(b) = ()(0) = lim

= lim

(i)2()()
i(+)()

and analogous relations for  and . the results are:

vc = vs = 1

(85)

the fact that the two velocities are the same seems to be peculiar to the model in consideration and not a general

property of the family of fateevs models. in general vs depends on g and on the number of toda chains.

thus we have shown that the presence of chemical potentials introduces additional energy scales in the problem
with non trivial crossovers. at temperatures t  h, n and n (n 6= ) modes decouple from the other modes. the
same happens for e1 at energies smaller then their gap and in some physical regions there is also an intermediate
energy scale, as we will see in the next section. as one lowers the temperature below tsep the gapless modes decouple
from each other and the picture of two non-interacting luttinger liquids emerges.

vii. weak coupling limit: non perturbative results

now we wish to focus our attention on the limit g  1 which corresponds to the weak-coupling limit of the bosonic
theory. naively one can imagine to obtain perturbative results. it turns out however that, in the presence of the
chemical potential, this is not the case, the reason being that the kinks condensate survives and aects the excitation
spectrum. a similar eect is present in the klein-gordon limit of the sine-gordon model6.

to be specic let us consider the situation a) of section iii, all the energies n (n 6= ) have gaps of the order of
h and can be omitted at temperatures t << h. to obtain information on the excitation spectrum one has to
study the fundamental equations (31) and (42). the standard relativistic dispersion law: e1() = m1 cosh , can be
modied by the last term in (31) which emerge in presence of kinks.

again we can study tba equations with the kernel k0() and g0() in the limits of large and small b. we focus
the attention on this second case where the eects we want to consider can be seen more clearly. to study eq.(31)
for small b we need the kernel k0() only for small . this is equivalent to approximating eq.(86) for large , as:

k0()

(88)

approximating also the rhs of eq. (42) for small  we can rewrite it as:

(89)
where h = h/2 m and  denote the convolution of support (b, b) and k0 is the fourier transform of (88). one
can absorb the constant part of the kernel in e0 introducing the new function e0 = 2
 (1  g)e0. equation (42) then
becomes:

k0e0 = m 2/2  h

of eq.(31). the dotted line represents the solution in the absence of kink condensate. in the lower gure we plot the gapless

we can now use the above results to solve eq(31). rewriting the fourier transform of the kernel g0 as:

the numerical solution is shown on fig. 3. one can clearly see that even in the weak coupling limit the dispersion
law is drastically modied at small .

this analysis is supposed to clarify the subject of dierent energy scales present in the model (cfr.fig.4). at very
small doping, q  q1  m (g  1)1/3, ef is smaller then m and there are two scales besides h: m and ef itself.
the mode e1 is completely decoupled at low temperature. as you increase the doping you reach an intermediate
region, characterized by m (1  g)1/3  q  q2  m (1  g)1, where ef  m but still much smaller then e1. at
very large doping we nd a very interesting region. as we have seen in sec. iii at large q (or equivalently at large b)
ef  q, while e1(0)  q. then there is a regime in which ef is bigger then the gap of the e1-mode, and there
will be temperatures, t  ef for which the e1-mode becomes soft.

viii. discussion

we have considered in some detail the thermodynamics of one of the integrable eld theories recently introduced
by fateev. most of the results are quite general and remain valid also for other models of the family. these models
are interesting for various reasons. first of all they have peculiar mathematical properties mostly related to a dual
representation of the theory. in addition they probably can nd application to various physical systems. considering
the model as a (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theory one can interpret it as two one dimensional conductors
coupled via phonon interaction. the problem of quasi one dimensional systems with electron-phonon interaction is
a very important one and cannot be approached with perturbative methods, it is then very important to have exact
results for some specic model. this interpretation of the model and the possible application to physical systems have
been discussed in ref.4, for physical regimes dierent from the one considered here (i.e. for g < 1/2). on the other side,
the euclidean version of the model, in the bosonic representation, describes an eective landau-ginzburg theory of
two coupled superconductors. in the specic model considered in this work, the coupling between the superconductors
is quite simple. nevertheless for other models of the fateevs family, where coupling between the fermionic modes is
achieved via a higher number of toda chains, the resulting coupling between the two superconductors is via elastic
modes and then can be interpreted as two layered superconductors separated by an insulating stratum. in relation
to the high-tc (cuprate) superconductors an interesting problem is to study the dependence of the superconducting
properties on the number of insulating layers between the superconducting planes. we will address this problem in a
separate publication.

let us give a brief summary of our results. as shown in sec.vii the results are non-perturbative also in the weak
coupling regime and could only be obtained through exact or non-perturbative methods. this is related to the fact
that the chemical potentials generate a kink condensate that survives in the weak coupling limit. as we have shown,
for some combinations of the chemical potentials two gapless modes emerge and various energy scales appears, which
characterizes crossovers between dierent regimes. probably the most interesting region of the phase diagram is
obtained at large doping where the e1-mode become soft at temperatures for which the e0-one is still frozen. it
deserves further investigation. another important result is the one contained in eq.(17). this equation tells us that
charged particles in the fateevs model are linear combinations of particles located on the edges, which is important
for qualitative understanding of the physics of the model.
