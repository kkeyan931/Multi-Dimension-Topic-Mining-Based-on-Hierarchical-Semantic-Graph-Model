abstract

we present a new bound for the worldvolume actions of branes with a wess-

zumino term. for this we introduce a generalization of calibrations for which the

calibration form is not closed. we then apply our construction to nd the m-5-

brane worldvolume solitons in an ads background that saturate this bound. we

show that these worldvolume solitons are supersymmetric and that they satisfy

dierential equations which generalize those of standard calibrations.

1. introduction

the dynamics of branes in a at background is described, in the absence of

born-infeld type elds, by a nambu-goto type of action. the solutions of the

eld equations of such an action are minimal manifolds. a subclass of solutions

of the nambu-goto action preserve a proportion of spacetime supersymmetry and

saturate a bound. the most elegant way to formulate this bound and nd the

proportion of supersymmetry preserved by a solution is in terms of calibrations

[1, 2, 3]. because brane worldvolume solitons have the bulk interpretation of

intersecting branes, recently there has been much activity in applying calibrations

to nd worldvolume solitons of branes. these are then used to investigate the

quantum theory of certain gauge theories [4]. despite the many applications that

calibrations have in string and m-theory, there are certain limitations. one is that

there does not seem to be a generalization of the calibration bound in the presence

of born-infeld type elds on the brane worldvolume. another limitation is that

the description of brane dynamics on curved backgrounds may also require the

modication of the nambu-goto action by wess-zumino terms. in the presence of

such wess-zumino terms, the standard argument used to establish the calibration

bounds does not apply.

in this letter, we shall modify the denition of calibrations of [hvl, hv] to es-

tablish a new bound for the brane worldvolume actions with certain types of wess-

zumino terms. as for standard calibrations, these new calibrations are associated

with a calibration k-form  which satises the inequality

(



 )  1

(1.1)

when evaluated at any appropriately normalized k-co-form


 , but in this case  is

not closed, i.e.

d 6= 0 .

(1.2)

this modication in the denition of a calibration allows us to relate the form

eld strength f associated with the wess-zumino term of the brane action to the

2

calibration form as f = d. let vol(m ) and wz(m ) be the volume and the wess-

zumino term of a manifold m , respectively. for static worldvolume congurations,

we shall establish a bound

vol(m ) + wz(m )  vol(m ) + wz(m ) ,

(1.3)

where m is a k-dimensional manifold for which (


 m is its co-
volume. we shall apply our method to nd the calibrations associated with the
m-5-brane in an ads7  s4 background. such backgrounds have been used to
formulate new duality conjectures [7]. for this, we shall determine the calibration


 m ) = 1 and

forms and relate them to the wess-zumino term. we shall then nd that many of

the dierential equations associated with standard calibrated surfaces in at spaces
admit a natural generalization on ads7  s4.

2. generalized calibrations

let (n, g) be a n-dimensional oriented riemannian manifold equipped with a

metric g and g(k, tpn ) be the grassmannian of oriented k-planes in the tangent
space tpn at the point p  n . then for   g(k, tpn ) , there exists an orthonor-
mal basis {e1...en} of tpn such that {e1...ek} is a basis of . the co-volume of 
is then



 = e1  ...  ek.

(2.1)

we dene a calibration of degree k on an open subset u  n to be a k-form

 with the following properties:

(i) at each p  u ,

p(



)  1

(2.2)

for all   g(k, tpn ), and

3

(ii) the contact set

g() = {  g(k, tpn ) : (

) = 1}



(2.3)

is non-empty. now a k-dimensional submanifold m of n is calibrated if

p(


 m ) = 1

(2.4)

for every p  m , where
denition of a calibration [5,6] it is further required that


 m is the co-volume of m .

in the conventional

d = 0 .

(2.5)

to distinguish between the calibrations according to the old and new def-

initions, we shall refer to the former as standard calibrations and to the

latter as generalized calibrations or simply calibrations.

it remains to establish the bound. for this, let m be a calibrated submanifold
of n and u  m . then let v be a deformation of u such that u, v have the same
boundary u = v . then we have

vol(u ) = z (



 u )u = z (



 v )v +z d(



 d)d  vol(v ) +z d(


 d)d ,

(2.6)
where d is a disc with boundary d = u  v and u is the volume form of u
and similarly for the rest. to establish the second equality in (2.6), we have used

stokes theorem. next let w be a reference open set such that w = u = v ,
and d1 and d2 be discs such that d1 = u  w , d2 = v  w and d2 = d1 d.
then the above inequality can be rearranged such that

vol(u ) z d(



 d1)d1  vol(v ) z d(


 d2)d2 .

(2.7)

but using a slight variation of the denition of a wess-zumino term, w z, as given

4

in [8], we can set

w z(u ) = z d(
w z(v ) = z d(


 d1)d1


 d2)d2 .

(2.8)

with (k+1)-form eld strength f = d. substituting the denitions of the wess-

zumino terms above in (2.7), we derive the inequality that we have stated in the

introduction. this inequality is saturated by the calibrated submanifolds of n . in

the case of a standard calibration d = 0 and so the above inequality reduces to

that of [6] for the volumes of u and v .

3. near horizon m-5-brane geometries

let {x;  = 0, . . . , 5} be the worldvolume coordinates of m-5-brane. the

m-5-brane supergravity solution is

ds2 = h  1

3 dxdx + h

g4 = dh

2

3(cid:0)dr2 + r2ds2(s4)(cid:1)

where  is the minkowski metric on e(1,5), r is a radial coordinate and

h = 1 +

r3
r3 ;

(3.1)

(3.2)

r is a constant. near the position r = 0 of the m-5-brane, the solution becomes

ds2  gm n dxm dxn =
g4 = s 4.

r
r

dxdx +

r2
r2 (dr2 + r2ds2(s4))

(3.3)

the near horizon geometry of the m-5-brane [9] is therefore ads7  s4.

5

the near horizon m-5-brane above can be used as a background for an m-5-
brane probe with transverse scalars {x a; a = 1, . . . 5}. the worldvolume action of
the probe which is parallel to the background m-5-brane in the static gauge [10,

11] is

s = z d6xq det(g) z

d

f.

(3.4)

where g is the pull-back to the worldvolume of the background ads7s4 metric,
i.e.

g =

r2 abx ax b ,

r2 = abx ax b ,

and

f = d(cid:0)

r3

r3(cid:1)  dt  dx1  dx2  dx3  dx4  dx5 .

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

in the above action we have not included the (self-dual) 3-form worldvolume eld

which we have set to zero.

the eld equations for the transverse scalars x are

(3.8)

(3.9)

we shall be considering static solutions to these eld equations which have a

p-brane interpretation, i.e. solutions that are invariant under the action of the
poincare group on e(1,p). for such solution, the transverse scalars x will depend

6

on {xi; i = 1, . . . , 5 p} worldvolume coordinates. placing the worldvolume soliton
along the rst p worldvolume coordinates of the m-5-brane probe, we nd that

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

we remark that the metric g is the pull back of the metric on h 6p  s4 with
respect to x, where h 6p is a (6p)-dimensional hyperbolic space. using all these
redenitions, the non-trivial part of the eld equations for the p-brane worldvolume

soliton can be derived by varying the action

f = d(cid:0)

and  is a constant.

in what follows, we shall apply our calibrations to nd

solutions to eld equations of the action (3.13). we shall nd that that there are

generalized analogues to well known standard kahler, special lagrangian (slag)
and exceptional calibrations in rn.

the supersymmetry projection operator is

 =

1

6!g

    

(3.15)

where  are the pull-backs of the bulk  matrices. the proportion of supersym-
metry preserved by a solution of the eld equations of (3.13) is determined by the

7

number of linearly independent solutions to [12]

(1  ) = 0 ,

(3.16)

where  satisfy the killing spinor equations for the ads7  s4 background.

4. ads hermitian calibrations

the ads hermitian calibrations are the analogue to the kahler calibrations
on rn. to dene the degree 2 ads hermitian calibrations, we shall take n to be
conformal to the space h 2+1  s2m1 equipped with the metric
 (ds2(h (2+1)) + r2ds2(s2m1))

r

r(cid:1)

xa=1

dx2i1+2  dx2i+2 .

(4.5)

using this, we observe that i is a complex structure because it is a constant tensor

8

in the coordinate basis. we then proceed to dene the calibration form

 =

1
!  i .

(4.6)

the form  satises wirtingers inequality. this is because in the orthonormal

basis the calibration form in the same as that of the kahler calibration. the

subspaces of gr(2, tpn ) that saturate the bound are those that are complex with

respect to the complex structure i dened above. so  denes a calibration in the

generalized sense with contact set

g() = u ( + m)/u ()  u (m) .

(4.7)

the calibrated submanifolds are the complex submanifolds of n with respect to

the complex structure i.

our ads hermitian calibrated manifolds correspond to m-5-brane worldvol-
ume p-brane solitons for which p = 5  2 and with 2m non-vanishing transverse
scalars x. to establish this, it remains to show that f = d, where f is given in

(3.14). this can be veried by a straightforward computation. the argument for

computing the supersymmetry preserved by brane worldvolume solitons associated

with standard calibrations of [2, 3] can be easily generalized in this case. in par-
ticular, we nd that the above worldvolume solitons preserve 1/2+m of spacetime

supersymmetry. in an orthonormal frame of the metric g, the projection operators

are precisely those that have been found for the standard kahler case.

4.1. ads sas calibrations

special almost symplectic (sas) calibrations are the analogues of the standard

special lagrangian (slag) calibrations. to dene a degree  ads sas calibra-
tions, we shall take n to be conformal to the space h +1  s1 equipped with

(4.10)

(4.11)

let i be the almost complex structure with kahler form . the sas calibration

form is

 = re(e1 + ie+1)  . . .  (e + ie2)

(4.12)

since the form  coincides in an orthonormal basis with that used as a calibration

form in the slag case, it satises the same inequalities as those that can be

found in [5]. these inequalities are saturated by the special lagrangian -planes
in gr(, r2). so  denes a calibration in the generalized sense with contact set

g() = su ()/so() .

(4.13)

a consequence of this is that

im(e1 + ie+1)  . . .  (e + ie2) = 0 ,

(4.14)

and conversely, any plane that satises (4.14) is special lagrangian.

10

to derive the equations that our calibrated manifolds satisfy, we rst rewrite

the almost symplectic form in a coordinate basis as

r

r(cid:1)



xi=1

dxi  dyi

(4.15)

where yi = xi+. we expect that the calibrated manifolds m can be locally ex-
pressed as yi = yi(xj). moreover, the pull-back of  on m must vanish. this
implies that there is a function f = f (xi) such that

yi = if .

(4.16)

substituting this into (4.14), we nd that the function f satises

im(cid:2)det(cid:0)ij + i(cid:0)

2 ijf )(cid:3) = 0 ,

where

r2 = ijif jf .

(4.17)

(4.18)

degree two sas calibrations are the same as the degree two ads hermitian

calibrations investigated in the previous section. for degree three sas calibrations

the equation (4.17) reduces to

(mnmf nf )

3
2

r3

ijijf = det(ijf ) ,

(4.19)

where i, j, m, n = 1, 2, 3. to nd solutions to this equation, we assume that f is
spherically symmetric, i.e. f = f (u) where u2 = ijxixj. then the equation (4.19)

11

becomes

(

u2f

r3 f 2 = 0

where f  = d

du f . a solution is

f (u) = r3

v2 l(v2)dv ,

(4.20)

(4.21)

where u0, are constants and l(v) is the principal branch of the lambert function

which is analytic at v = 0 and satises

l(v)el(v) = v .

(4.22)

for degree four sas calibrations, the equation (4.17) reduces to

(mnmf nf )

3
2

r3

ijijf = xk

detk|k(ijf )

(4.23)

where i, j, m, n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and detk|k(ijf ) is the determinant of the matrix
(ijf ) with the k-column and k-raw missing. a spherically symmetric solution is

f (u) =

5r3
u

,

(4.24)

where where u2 = ijxixj.

our ads sas calibrated manifolds correspond to p-brane worldvolume m-5-
brane solitons for which p = 5   and with  non-vanishing transverse scalars x.
to establish this, it remains to show that f = d for  = 5 p, where f is given in
(3.14). this can be veried by a straightforward computation for the cases  = 3, 4

but it is not the case for  = 5. the argument for computing the supersymmetry

preserved by brane worldvolume solitons associated with standard calibrations of

[2, 3] can be easily generalized in this case. in particular, we nd that the sas
worldvolume m-5-brane solitons preserve 1/2 of spacetime supersymmetry. in the

orthonormal frame of the metric g, the projection operators are precisely those

that have been found for the standard slag case.

12

5. ads exceptional calibrations

the construction of ads exceptional calibrations proceeds in the same way as

for hermitian and for sas calibrations. one begins with the standard constant

exceptional calibration form in each case and constructs the calibration form of

the ads calibration by contracting it with an orthonormal basis of the associated

curved metric. it is clear that all the necessary inequalities follow by those pre-

sented in [5] for the exceptional cases. the contact sets of the ads exceptional
calibrations are those of the standard exceptional ones. in all these cases d = f

and so the calibrated manifolds have a p-brane worldvolume soliton interpreta-

tion. the supersymmetry preserved by each such solution is the same as that

for p-brane worldvolume solitons associated with the standard exceptional calibra-

tions. in what follows we shall simply state the metric on the manifold n and the

equations which the calibrated manifolds satisfy.

5.1. ads cayley calibrations

the ads cayley calibration is a degree four calibration in n equipped with

(5.1)

where r2 = ijyiyj and i, j = 1, . . . , 4. the calibration four-form is constructed
from the spin(7) invariant self-dual form on r8. the calibrated manifolds can be
locally expressed as yi = yi(x) and yi satisfy the modied cayley equations as

follows:

r

r(cid:1)3

(cid:0)

and

(1  2i  3j  4k) = 2  3  4 + 1  3  4i

i, j, k are the imaginary unit quaternions.

5.2. the ads associative calibration

the ads associative calibration is a degree three calibration in n with metric

ds2 =

r2
r2 ijdxidxj +

r
r

abdyadyb ,

(5.4)

where r2 = abyayb, a, b = 1, . . . , 4 and i, j = 1, . . . , 3. the calibration form can be
constructed from the g2 invariant three-form on r7 in the way that we have

explained above. the calibrated manifolds can be locally expressed as ya =

ya(x) and ya satisfy the following equations:

r

r(cid:1)3

(cid:0)

(1i + 2j + 3k) = 1  2  3

(5.5)

where  = y1 + iy2 + jy3 + ky4 and  are dened as for the cayley case above.

with metric

where r2 = abyayb, a, b = 1, . . . , 3 and i, j = 1, . . . , 4. the calibration form can
be constructed from the g2 invariant four-form on r7 in the way that we have
explained above. the calibrated manifolds can be locally expressed as ya = ya(x)
and ya satisfy the following equations:

r

r(cid:1)3

(cid:0)

(xi + y j + zk) = x  y  z

(5.7)

where x = y1, y = y2, z = y3 and  = 1 + i2 + j3 + k4. a well-known
example of a standard co-associative calibrated manifold is the lawson-osserman

14

co-associative cone. we may generalize this solution by considering the ansatz

xi + y j + zk = im(f (u)xix) ,

(5.8)

where x = x1 + ix2 + jx3 + kx4 and u2 = ijxixj. this solves the equation (5.7)
for

f (u) = 

4r3
u4 +

r3e
2u6 (e pe  16u2) ,

(5.9)

where  is a constant.

6. conclusions

we have found that the investigation of m-5-brane supersymmetric worldvol-
ume solitons on ads7  s4 background requires the generalization of calibrations
due to the presence of wess-zumino terms in the m-5-brane worldvolume action.

we have presented such a generalization of calibrations and we have established a

bound that is saturated by the calibrated manifolds. our construction is general

but when it is applied to the case of m-5-brane, the functional that is minimized

is related to the worldvolume action without born-infeld type elds. we have also
found that there is a correspondence between calibrations on ads7  s4 and cali-
brations on r(1,10) which induces a correspondence between the equations satised

by these calibrations.

there are many other cases to consider. for example solutions to brane probe

actions in the near horizon geometries of the m-2-brane and the d-3-brane; some

of the ads hermitian calibrations for the d-3-brane have been invetigated in [13].

our construction can be generalized to treat both these cases. it is clear that since

generic string and m-theory backgrounds have non-vanishing form eld strengths,

the investigation of supersymmetric worldvolume solutions may require a further

generalization of calibrations. these may have applications in strings, m-theory

and dierential geometry.
