abstract

the paper is devoted to quantization of polynomial momentum observables in the
cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold. a quantization procedure is proposed
allowing to quantize a wide class of functions which are polynomials of any order
in momenta. in the last part of the paper the quantum mechanics of scalar particle
in curved space-time is studied with the use of proposed approach.

introduction

in the paper, the problem of quantization of polynomial classical observables is studied.
it is well-known that it is impossible to fully quantize the algebra of polynomials on a
euclidean phase space [1, 2, 3]. consequently, research has concentrated in two main
directions. the rst is weakening the notion of full quantization. in this direction
various quantization schemes have been developed to the present time [3, 4, 5, 6].

the second direction is quantizing of restricted classes of observables. such classes
are usually connected with symmetries of the phase space [7, 8]. if we are interested in
phase spaces n which have a distinguished conguration space, i.e. n = t m, then an
important class of classical observables is one of functions polynomial in momenta. the
results obtained previously in quantizing of such functions deals mainly with observables
quadratic in momenta sniat1,gotay.

in present paper, a quantization procedure is proposed allowing to quantize a wide
class of functions which are polynomials of any order in momenta. we use the geometric
quantization procedure of kirillov, kostant and souriau (see [4, 7, 10] for review). as
an application of proposed procedure, the quantization of the hamiltonian of a scalar
pointlike particle in curved space-time is considered.

1 the work was partially supported by grants of kazan mathematical society and russian founda-

tion for basic researches (project no 96-01-01031).

the plan of the paper is as follows. in sec. 1 the main aspects of geometric quanti-
zation scheme are presented. next section is devoted to the quantization of polynomial
momentum observables in a phase space which is the cotangent bundle of a smooth
manifold.
in the last part of the paper the quantum mechanics of scalar particle in
curved space-time is studied with the use of the proposed approach.

1 . geometric quantization

in this section we shortly describe the geometric quantization method which will be
used in following sections (see [4, 7, 10] for review).

let (n, ) is a symplectic manifold and c (n) be the set of c -functions on n.
for any f  c (n) its hamiltonian vector eld ad (f ) can be dened by the equation
( ad (f )) = df, where  is the internal product. the poisson bracket

{f1, f2} = ad (f1)(f2),

f1, f2  c (n)

turns c (n) into a lie algebra  the poisson algebra of n. if the hamiltonian vector
eld ad (f ) is complete then f generates via the poisson brackets a one-parameter group
t

f of canonical transformation of n [11, 12].

a quantization is the linear map q of a subalgebra f  c (n) into the set of
self-adjoint operators in a hilbert space h possessing the following quantization axioms
(q1) q 1 = idh;
(q2) [q f1,q f2] = ihq ({f1, f2}) where h = h/2 is the planck constant;
(q3) for a complete set of functions f1, . . . , fr the operators q(f1), . . . ,q(fr) also
form a complete set [4].
geometric quantization is an explicit realization of the quantization map (see [5, 6]
for review of another quantization approaches) providing a constructive way of quantiz-
ing subalgebras of the poisson algebra.

the geometric quantization procedure includes the following main components [4,

2, 7, 10].

a) prequantization line bundle l that is a hermitian line bundle over n with con-
nection d, d-invariant2 hermitian structure <, >. the connection form  of d should
obey the prequantization condition d = h1.
b) polarization f that is an integrable lagrange distribution in t n r c. the
polarization plays an important role in the geometric quantization approach, because it
determines the representation space.

c) metaplectic structure which consists of the bundle of metalinear frames and the

if these structures are dened on a symplectic manifold (n, ), then the hilbert

bundle l  nf of l-valued half-forms normal to the polarization f .
space h is dened to be the space of sections  of the bundle l  nf which are
covariantly constant along the polarization f . a function f  c (n) is called polar-
ization preserving if its lie derivative lx ad (f )  f for any vector x  f . for such
functions the quantization is dened by the souriau-kostant prequantization formula

q(f ) = (f  ihd ad (f )),

dx = 0,

  h, x  f.

(1.1)

in order to quantize functions not preserving polarization one should construct a map-
ping connecting the hilbert spaces hf corresponding to dierent polarizations. a way
of doing it is provided by the blattner-kostant-sternberg (bks) kernel [7, 10].

2recall that d-invariance means that for each pair of sections  and  of l and each real vector

eld x on m holds x < ,  >=< dx,  > + < , dx  >.

further we shall consider a particular case when the system under consideration has
a physically distinguished conguration space m, i.e. n = t m. dene the canonical
1-form  by (u) = ((u)) for each   t m, u  t t m where  : t m  m is
the cotangent bundle projection and  is its dierential. the 2-form  = d is closed
and non-degenerate and turns t m into a symplectic manifold.

for each smooth vector we dene a function px on t m by px() = (x(())),

  t m. we shall refer to px as the momentum associated to a vector eld x.
if x,  = 1, . . . , n are local coordinates in a domain u  m, then we can introduce
the canonical coordinate system (1(u), x, p) where p = p (/x). in these coor-
dinates on t m the symplectic form  takes the canonical form  = p dp  dx. let
 : t m  m be the tangent bundle projection, then the vertical polarization f =ker 
can be dened spanned by the vector elds /x .
it is easy to demonstrate that the vertical polarization leads to the schrodinger
representation. for construction of the hilbert space hf corresponding to this rep-
resentation we should dene a global section of the bundle of metalinear frames l 
nf over t m. we demonstrate further (see [7] for details) how it can be done with
the use of a non-degenerate symmetric tensor eld  of second rank on the conguration
space m. this tensor eld can be considered as a (pseudo) riemannian metric on m.
first, we note that there exists an isomorphism between the sections  of the bundle

b  nf and the set of complex-valued functions # on b  b\{0} possessing the
c  c. this isomorphism is given by (z) = #(z)z
property #(cz) = c1#(z),
where  : b  t m is the projection.
for each chart (u, x) on m, the metric  denes a matrix-valued function u =
(u) on u. let u = {1, . . . , n} be an orthonormal frame for t u

 = x

c 



x ,

det c > 0,

(cuc t ) = .

from here det c = | det u|1/2. let u = {1, . . . , n} be the frame eld for f dened
by u = ad (x)(c t  )1 and let u be a metalinear frame eld [7] projecting onto u.
then we can dene a local section u of b by #

u   = 1 satisfying

u = |(det u)  |1/4u

where u is the metalinear frame eld for u. using the transformation properties of
 it can be shown that u denes a covariantly constant global section  of b such
that, for each open domain u  m,

|1(u ) = |(det u)  |1/4u.

(1.2)

if f is the vertical polarization, then the symplectic form is exact  = d and each

section  covariantly constant along f can be represented in the form

 =  0  

(1.3)

where 0 is a non-vanishing section of l and  is a complex-valued function on m.
quantization procedure can be written in the form [4, 7]

by the function f . if the support of  is contained in some coordinate neighborhood u,
then we can write

where  is a function on rn with support contained in the image of the chart x : u 
rn. comparing (1.5) and (1.2) we nd, for each y  u,

 0   = (x) 0  u

for suciently small t

(x(y)) = (y)| det u(y)|1/4.

2 . quantization of polynomial momentum observables

in this section we consider the quantization of polynomial momentum observables in the
phase space n = t m using the geometric quantization procedure in the schrodinger
representation. consider a classical system with an oriented conguration space m and
let f be the vertical polarization on the phase space t m.

let us denote cr(n) the subspace c (n) consisting of the functions which are at
most r-th degree polynomials along the bers of the cotangent bundle projection. a
function f  cr(m) can be represented as a sum of homogeneous terms of the form

f(k) = f 1...k

(k)

(x)p1 . . . pk,

k = 1, . . . , r.

(2.1)

along with the functions f(k) we shall consider further the associated tensor elds (k) =
f 1...k
(k)

1 . . . k .

consider the quantization for the homogeneous terms (2.1) of any order in momenta.

in order to construct the quantization map for a function f  cr(n) we should rst
at rst, let us dene a global non-vanishing section 0 of the bundle l  nf of
l-valued half-forms normal to the (vertical) polarization. as it was shown in sec. 2, such
section can be constructed using a (pseudo)riemannian metric  on the conguration
space m.

in fact we can choose any such metric on m in order to construct the section 0.

however, in applications we are usually interesting in a natural choice of .

the problem simplies if for given function f the matrix (f 

in this case we can put  = f(2) dqdq, f(2)f 

(2) ) in (2.1) is non-
. however, if
degenerate.
(f 
(2) ) is degenerate, one should choose 0 using additional considerations. for example,
a (pseudo)riemannian structure on the conguration space m could be used, motivated
by some physical reasons.

when the global section of l  nf is chosen, we have to develop an approach

for quantization of the homogeneous terms (2.1) for any order k. in fact, we propose
here a way of quantizing only a wide class of such terms.

(2) = 

for k = 0, 1 the functions are vertical polarization preserving and it is easy to
write down the expressions for corresponding operators [7] using the kostant-souriau
prequantization formula (1.1)

consider now the case k  2. let us suppose that it is possible to introduce in a
neighborhood of any point y  m such coordinates (x) that the rst partial derivatives
of the functions f 12...k
at y are equal to zero. we shall call such coordinates normal
with respect to the tensor eld (k) = f 1...k
1 . . . k . the problem of nding the
normal coordinates is equivalent to determining of a (local) linear connection in which
the tensor eld (k) is covariantly constant.

(k)

(k)

it is easy to see that in general case it is impossible to nd such connection, because
the corresponding system of algebraic equations on connection coecients is overdeter-
mined. however, the coordinates normal with respect to a tensor eld can be introduced
in many important cases. for example, if m is a (pseudo)riemannian manifold with
the metric g then it is possible to nd the coordinates normal with respect to covari-
antly constant tensors (k) coincides with the riemannian normal coordinates. in the
next section we shall see how it allows us to quantize the hamiltonian of the relativistic
particle on curved space-time background.

in the following we suppose that the function f(k) is such that in a neighborhood
of any point y  m it is possible to introduce the coordinates normal with respect to a
given tensor eld (k).

in this case the integral in (1.8) can be simplied if the coordinates (x) are normal at
the point y with respect to the tensor eld (k). in this case the functions x depend
linearly on t along the orbits of the group t

let us now quantize the function f = f(k) = f 1...k

it is possible to approximate the integrand in (1.8) so that the integration will give
results accurate to rst order in t. after that eq. (1.8) takes the form

(2.2)

it is easy to see that together with (1.4) and (1.7) this formula denes a quantization

coinciding with the quantization of the function

this function can be quantized using the von neumann rule (see appendix)

q(a1...k p1 . . . pk) = a1...kq(p1) . . .q(pk ),

a1...k = const.

from here using (1.3) we get

(2.4)

because the point y  m in these considerations was chosen to be appropriate, the
formula (2.4) give the quantization operator corresponding to any homogeneous term of
the form (2.1).

3 . quantum mechanics in curved space-time

as an application of the approach proposed in the previous section let us consider
quantization of hamiltonian of a particle in a curved space-time which is a general
riemannian manifold (m, g).
we develop here the quantum theory of a pointlike scalar particle in curved space-
time as quantization of its classical mechanics. this approach to construction of quan-
tum theory is almost obvious, however it is badly developed in relativistic case because
of well-known diculties with quantizing of non-linear observables. usually, the eld
theoretical approach to construction of quantum mechanics in curved space-time has
been used instead [13, 14] which deduces the (nite-dimensional) quantum mechanical
description from the eld equations describing corresponding innite-dimensional eld
systems.

consider rst the formulation of classical mechanics of the system. it can be for-
mulated by the use of an instant spacelike surface   m [16]. if we choose the local
coordinates v,  = 1, . . . , 3 on  then the hamiltonian of the particle takes the form

h = qpp + g00 m2

where m is the particles mass and  is the induced metric on ,  = g/g00.

let us consider approximation of h for small values of momenta pp << m2

h = h1 + h2 + h3 + higher order terms.

(3.1)

where

h1 = mg00,

h2 = g00

gpp

h3 = mg00

(gpp)2

.

for simplicity further we consider only the case g00 = 1 whence  = g. quantizing
the rst two terms in this expression we get [7, 17]

(3.2)

where  is the covariant derivative with respect to 3-metric  and r is the scalar
curvature.

let us consider the third term in (3.1). introducing the riemannian normal coor-
dinates and applying the method developed in the previous section we see that quanti-
zation of the function (gpp)2 leads in these coordinates to the quantization of the
function p(p)4. from here

q (h3) (x) =

(3.3)

taking in account the equation (1.6) we can nd the expression for (qh3) in an
appropriate coordinates. in order to do it we rst list all possible independent invariant
terms which could appear in this expression:

i1 = r2,

i2 = r,

i3 = rr,

i4 = rr,

i5 = r,,

i6 = r,,

i7 = r  ,

i8 = gg,.

here the comma denotes the covariant derivative , r, r and r are riemann,
ricci and scalar curvatures of  and  = g. using (1.6), in riemannian normal
coordinates we nd from (3.3)

appendix

we consider here the von neumann rule (2.3). relations of such type appears in various
quantization approaches (see e.g. [3, 19]). the simplest general form of von neumann
rule is

(a.1)
for a distinguished class of observables cd, f  cd and certain function   c (r).
it is easy to see that (a.1) is not true for all observables cd = c (n). however, it is
obviously true for restricted classes of functions on the phase space.

q(  f ) = (qf )

we shall prove here the relation

where  is a symmetric k-linear real-valued mapping of the momentum space.

q((p1, . . . , pk) = (qp1, . . . , pk)

(a.2)

since [qp,qp] = 0 we have

[q(p1 . . . pk),qp] = ihq({p1 . . . pk, qp}) = 0

for any 1, . . . , k = 1, . . . , n because [qp,qp] = 0. at the same time

[q(p1 . . . pk),qx] = ihq({p1 . . . pk ,qx}) =
1 p2 . . . pk + 

k p1 . . . pk1) = [q(p1) . . .q(pk ),qx].

ihq(

from here it follows that q(p1 . . . pk ) = q(p1) . . .q(pk ) + t where t is an operator
commuting with both momenta and coordinates.

supposing by induction that (a.2) holds for k  1and using the formula [9]

q(px) =

1
2

(q(p)q(x) + q(x)q(p))

we get



q(p1 . . . pk ) = q({p1 . . . pk), px}) =

[q(p1) . . .q(pk ) + t, q(p)q(x) + q(x)q(p)] = q(p1) . . .q(pk).

[q(p1 . . . pk ),q(px)] =

by linearity of the quantization mapping this proves the genralized von neumann rule
(a.2) and (2.3).
