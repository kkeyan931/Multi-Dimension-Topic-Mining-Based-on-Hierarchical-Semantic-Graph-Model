abstract

in this paper we construct explicitly an innite number of hopons (static,
soliton solutions with non-zero hopf topological charges) within the recently
proposed 3 + 1-dimensional, integrable and relativistically invariant eld theory.
two integers label the family of hopons we have found. their product is
equal to the hopf charge which provides a lower bound to the solitons nite en-
ergy. the hopons are constructed explicitly in terms of the toroidal coordinates
and shown to have a form of linked closed vortices.

recent numerical studies of the faddeev-skyrme modied o(3) sigma-model [1]
support existence of static toroidal solutions stabilized by their non-zero hopf numbers
[2]. the emerging string-like structures are quite intriquing and may nd applications
in various physical models of condensed matter physics and gauge eld theory.

in [3] we have introduced the three-dimensional eld model which falls into a class
of higher dimensional integrable models from the point of view of the generalized zero-
curvature approach [4]. the question posed in [3] was whether this form of integrability
is linked to the existence of soliton solutions as it is expected from the study of two-
dimensional integrable models. our analysis of the model in [3] has indeed revealed
one non-trivial soliton solution described by a standard hopf map of unit hopf index.
to fully establish connection between integrability and soliton solutions would require
nding other topological solitons with arbitrary topological charges. this is accom-
plished in this letter. the equations of motion of the model are solved in toroidal
coordinates and the space of solutions is found to be represented by a family of maps
r3  r2 labeled by two integers. the integers count number of times the map winds
around two independent angular directions.

the model under consideration is described by the lagrangean density

l = 0(cid:16)h 2
(cid:17)

where 0 = 1, determines the choice of the signature of the minkowski metric,
g = 0 diag (1,1,1,1) and the eld-tensor h is dened in terms of the three
component, unit vector eld ~n  s2 as

h  ~n  (~n  ~n) .

(2)

the action in (1) is o(3) and poincare invariant. the value 3/4 of the power of h 2
 in
(1) is such that the theory circumvents the usual obstacle of derricks scaling argument
against existence of stable solitons. we are interested in the boundary condition ~n =
(0, 0, 1) at spatial innity. this condition compacties eectively the euclidean space
r3 to the three-sphere s3. accordingly, ~n becomes a map: s3  s2. due to 3(s2) =
z, the eld congurations fall into disjoint classes characterized by the value of the
hopf invariant qh.

using stereographic projection of s2 :

one obtains

~n =

which play a crucial role in establishing integrability of the model. indeed, using rela-
tions (8) and the equations of motion (7) one obtains an innite number of conserved
currents given by

j  k

g

with g being any functional of u and u only (no derivatives).
in reference [3] we
have analyzed the integrability properties of this theory using the generalized version
of the zero curvature condition [4]. the equations of motion (7) can be represented
as b + [ a , b ] = 0, with a being a at su(2) connection, and b being an
operator living in any integer spin representation of su(2) (for more details see [3, 4]).
the integrability properties emerge due to the fact that b can be put in any integer
spin representation, and that is a direct consequence of (8) [4, 5]. the question we
address here is whether the above notion of integrability implies existence of the innite
many soliton solutions.

we shall look for time-independent solutions to equations of motion (7) of the type1:

where we used toroidal coordinates on r3:

u (, , )  f ()ei(m+n)

x = aq1 sinh  cos  , y = aq1 sinh  sin 

z = aq1 sin 

;

a > 0 ; q = cosh   cos 

1we shall take m and n integers in order for u to be single valued.

the angles ,  both vary from 0 to 2 and  varies from 0 to . the surfaces of
constant  are toroids that circle the z-axis, =constant are spheres and =constant
are half-planes. the corresponding gradient of u becomes in toroidal coordinates:

~u = (q/a)ei(m+n) f ()e + imf ()e + inf ()

e

(12)

where we introduced the unit vectors spanning the orthogonal toroidal coordinate sys-
tem having properties ei  ej = ij, i, j  , , .

in terms of the vector-eld ~k  (cid:16) ~k  ~u(cid:17)1/4 ~k/(|u|2 + 1) the equations of motion
(7) become, in the static case, ~  ~k = 0, i.e. ~k is solenoidal. using (10) and (12) we
obtain for the components of ~k:
(sinh )2! f ;

one observes that f depends only on the ratio m2/n2, and that f 2  0 for any value
of m2/n2. note, that taking the limit m  n in (21) and using lhospital rule yields:

in the special case of m = n = 1 eq.(23) reproduces the standard soliton solution
[6, 3]. expression (23) can be written as a composite of the hopf map together with
the stereographic map : r3  s3 of degree 1.

or equivalently, for ~n dened from u via relation (3) :

ni = z iz ; z  = (z

let, furthermore

ai =

be a vector potential for the two-form hij = iaj  jai. in terms of the toroidal
coordinates the components of ~a are

next, we calculate the vector function ~b = ~  ~a (such that bi = ijkhjk/2), using
expression for the curl operator in toroidal coordinates and plugging it into the hopf
index dened as :

(29)

0 ! = nm

it is always possible to choose the hopf index such that it is positive qh  0. this
amounts to the right choice of orientation, which determines the sign of qh .

note, that the following inequality:

|m| + |n|  2q|n||m|

always holds. hence

q|n||m|(|n| + |m|) 

2(|n||m|)3/4  em,n  (2)24  23/4 |qh|3/4

which agrees with the lower bound result by [7] for the faddeev-skyrme model.

notice that the solution obtained above implies that the vector eld ~n (see (3)) is

given by

n1 =

2f

f 2 + 1

cos (m + n) ;

n2 =

sin (m + n) ;

n3 =

f 2  1

since f is a function of  only, one observes that the surfaces of constant n3 are tori. in
addition, on those surfaces, the lines of constant n1 and n2 wind around the tori with
frequencies in the  and -directions given by m and n, respectively. one can check
that n3 falls monotonically from n3 = 1 at  = 0 to n3 = 1 at  = . in addition,
the bigger the ratio m/n is, the faster if performs that ip. therefore the size of our
soliton decreases with the increase of m/n.

i=1 2

the hopf index of our solution can alternatively be calculated in the following way.
the solution provides a mapping of the spatial r3 into s3 dened by p4
i = 1.
then, (3) and (29) provide the hopf map s3  s2. the hopf index is given by
the linking number of the pre-images, under the hopf map, of any two points of s2.
consider the point ~n = (0, 0,1) which corresponds in r3 to   . for this value
of , 1, 2 go to zero and 3 = cos n and 4 =  sin n. on s3 we nd the
4 = cos2 n + sin2 n = 1 of radius 1 and as  varies between 0 and
circle 2
2 the preimage wraps | n | times around the  direction. similarly the preimage of
~n = (0, 0, 1) corresponds to  = 0. for this value of , 3, 4 go to zero and 1 = cos m
2 = cos2 m + sin2 m = 1 of radius
and 2 = sin m. on s3 we nd the circle 2
1 and as  varies between 0 and 2 the preimage wraps | m | times around the 
direction. since these two circles intersect the linking number is | nm |. that is indeed
the hopf number calculated above.

finally, let us mention that other models circumventing derricks theorem have
been proposed previously in the literature [8, 6]. a common feature is that, like the
model considered in the present paper, the lagragians are non-polynomial functions
of the elds and their derivatives. the corresponding solutions have been constructed
and in the special case of [6] a soliton with the unit hopf charge was obtained. to our
knowledge, an innite number of soliton solutions to the eld theoretical equations of
motion with the hopf charges bigger than unity were not obtained previously in the
literature in an exact form.
