abstract

pseudo conformal eld theories are theories with the same fusion rules, but

dierent modular matrix as some conventional eld theory. one of the authors

dened these and conjecture that, for bosonic systems, they can all be realized by

some actual rcft, which is that of free bosons. we complete the proof here by

treating the non diagonal automorphism case. it is shown that for characteristic
p 6= 2, they are equivalent to a diagonal case, fully classied in our previous pub-
lication. for p = 2n we realize the non diagonal cases, establishing this theorem.

rational conformal eld theories in two dimensions have been the subject of

intense investigation in recent years. this is due to the fact that they aord

a tractable environment in which to test quantum eld theory, along with their

cardinal role in string theory and condensed matter systems. several families of

such theories were studied, for the most part stemming from free bosons or the

wzwsugawara ane construction.

in ref. [1], it was shown that a much larger family of rcft may exist, where

one takes the same fusion rules as the known ones, but with a dierent modular

matrix. the latter theories are termed pseudo conformal eld theories. the general

philosophy is that these new conformal data correspond to full edged rcft,

which for the most part, are yet to be explored. the simplest case of this is the

bosonic and pseudo bosonic systems, where we conjectured that all pseudo bosonic

systems are equivalent to some other conventional bosonic system.

in ref.

[2],

we proved the diagonal case. our purpose here is to nd realizations for the non

diagonal case, thus completing this theorem. in passing, we note that pseudo ane

systems were treated in ref. [3], where many new families of theories were found,

but much remains to be done.

the conventional bosonic theories are dened as a vector of free bosons, ~

propagating on some lattice m. the primary elds are labeled by elements of
m/m, i.e., the dual lattice modulo the lattice. the fusion rules are the way two
elds fuse in the ope,

[a]  [b] = [a + b],

(1)

i.e., simple addition modulo m. another important data is the modular matrix,
s, which implements   1/ , where  is the modulus of the torus. a relation
observed by verlinde [4] relates the fusion rules and the modular matrix,

f 

, = pa s,as,as,a

s0,a

,

(2)

where f 

, is the fusion algebra structure constant. now, the point made in ref [1]
is that taking xed fusion rules and solving for the modular matrix s, there are

2

numerous solutions for any given fusion rules, other then the known ones. these

were termed pseudo conformal eld theories.

for the bosonic systems, let g = m/m be the abelian group. the fusion
rules are the group algebra over g. for each such g we can dene some scalar
product, rather arbitrarily, which is a bilinear form of the group, g(, ) =   .
now, the general solution to verlinde eq. (2), can be written as

s, = exp[2i  h()],

(3)

where h is any symmetric automorphism of g, h()  =  h(). this was proved
in ref. [2]. the rest of the conformal data is given by,

 =

h()

2

mod z,

eic/4 = |g| 1

2 xm /m

eih(),

(4)

(5)

where  is the dimension of [], and c is the central charge of the theory (dened

modulo 8).

now, if g and h are isomorphic groups, g  h, evidently they will give
precisely the same solutions to eq. (2). thus, we may use any lattice we wish, if
it has the same group, g  m/m. here, we invoke the basic theorem of abelian
groups, which says that any nite abelian group is isomorphic to

g  i

zpni

i

,

(6)

where the pis are some primes and ni some integers. thus, it is enough to consider

the case of

n = i

su(pni

i )1,

(7)

which has the same fusion rules, g  n/n.

3

now, how does the general automorphism of n looks like? we can choose a

basis for the lattice n as a vector in each of the su(pni

i ),

   =xi

i()i(),

(8)

where i() is the projection on the ith summand. we can describe h, the auto-
morphism as a matrix, hij = i  h(j), where i is a generator of su(pni
i ). the
matrix hij is integral and symmetric. if pi 6= pj then hij = 0. if pi = pj = p then
hijpni = 0 mod pnj and gcd(det(h), p) = 1. any matrix hij obeying these condition
gives rise to a symmetric automorphism, and vice versa.

now if hij is a diagonal matrix we term this case regular. this case was realized

completely in ref [2]. our interest here is in the nonregular case. evidently we

can limit ourself to pi = pj = p for all i and j, and we can deal with the question

prime by prime.

we wish to realize all the nonregular cases. what would be a realization?

let nh be our conformal data, where h is some automorphism. we wish to nd
another lattice m such that the rcft, m1, has nh as the conformal data. this

is equivalent to nding an isomorphism q,

such that

q : n/n  m/m,

  h()/2 = q()2/2 mod z.

(9)

(10)

our aim here is to realize all the nonregular cases, thus completing the theorem

mentioned in the introduction.

note, that not all the matrices hij give rise to a dierent theory. as noted

in ref.

[2], we are always free to transform the primary elds by some arbitrary

4

matrix b, gcd(det(b), p) = 1,

which is equivalent to changing the automorphism h by a similarity transformation,

  b,

(11)

h  bthb.

(12)

thus we need only realize one element from any of the similarity classes.

let us, thus, turn to the realization of the nonregular cases. we need to
distinguish two possibilities: 1) p 6= 2, 2) p = 2. so, let us rst assume that p 6= 2.
our claim is that by a similarity transformation any nondiagonal automorphism

can be seen to be equivalent to a diagonal one.

it is convenient to rst concentrate on a rank 2 automorphism h,

hij =  a b
c! .

b

(13)

and assume that ni = 1. this is the case where g is actually a eld. now, choose

b =  1 n

0

1!. then, according to eq. (12), h is equivalent to
 ! .
1! =   an + b

n 1!  a b
  1

c!  1 n



0

0

b

(14)

now, if a 6= 0 we may choose n = ba1 mod p, which exist since p is prime. this
means that for a 6= 0 we may diagonalize the automorphism.
! and now h =  0

if a = 0 then we choose b =   

0! becomes



b

b

 !  0
   

b

b

0!   

! =   b( + )



! .

thus, we need to solve the equation,

 +  = 0,

(16)

which always has solutions for p 6= 2. (for p = 2 it is equal to the determinant
which cannot vanish.) say, we take  =  =  =  = 1. it follows that h can be
assumed to be diagonal or a regular case.

now for a prime power, ni > 1, the proof is the same. we have to separate all

the cases where a = 0 mod p, but the proof works along the same lines. we omit

the details for brevity.

the same proof actually works for any rank of h. say, h is an n  n matrix.
then we diagonalize each hij 6= 0, where i 6= j, in turn, using a matrix with
the only non-diagonal entry bij. this is, in fact, very similar to the classical

diagonalization of symmetric matrices by similarity steps in elementary algebra.

we conclude that for p 6= 2 all automorphisms are indeed regular and thus can

be realized by the results of ref. [2].

for p = 2 only one step in the proof fails. this is the second step, where we

assumed a = 0 mod p. thus if a or c are odd, it is still equivalent to a diagonal

automorphism. it is thus left to deal with the cases a = c = 0 mod 2. we would like

to know which of these are equivalent under eld transformation. for rank(h) = 2,

the answer that we found is as follows. there are for any ni exactly (we assumed
that ni = nj; this is due to the fact that for ni 6= nj, only diagonal automorphisms
exist, as can be seen by the fact that all the elements of the matrix h must be

even.) two inequivalent nonregular automorphisms, which are

h =  0 1
1 0! ,

  2

1

1

2! .

(17)

an automorphism equivalent to the rst matrix, we call type (i), and the second

matrix type (ii). thus, all the automorphisms are diagonal, except for these two

6

exceptional types. this we found by running a mathematica program for p = 2n

up to n = 4.

subsequent to that we found and proved the following two theorems:

theorem (1): the group of rank m matrices modulo pn where p is any prime,

with determinant equal to 1 mod p, is generated by the following matrices,

a12

i,j = i,j + i,1j,2,

p 1,a
i,j = i,j  i,1j,1  i,aj,a + i,1j,a + i,aj,1,

which are the generators of permutations, and

m b

i,j = bi,1j,1 + i,j,

for b = ps mod pn, and s = 1, 2, . . . , n  1. here, i and j label the entries of the
matrices.

the proof of this theorem is outlined below. the second theorem is

theorem (2): all the rank m symmetric matrices over 2n, modulo the similarity
transformation eq. (12), can be written in 22 or 11 block diagonal form, where
the 2  2 matrices are of the three types mentioned above: diagonal, type (i) or
type (ii), eq. (17). let us now sketch the proof of these two theorems. let mn be
the group of such rank m matrices modulo pn. we have a natural map:

h : mn  mn1,

where h(m) is m modulo pn1. according to the isomorphism theorems,

mn1  mn/g,

(18)

(19)

where g = ker(h). g can be described as all the elements of mn which are equal to
the unit matrix modulo pn1. thus, inductively it is enogh to know g and mn1.

7

g is a group of 2m2

elements and thus it is generated by the matrices

m ab

ij = i,j + pn1a,ib,j,

(20)

where a, b = 1, 2, . . . , m and i, j denote the entries of the matrix m ab. the rest
of mn is evidently generated by the permutations and the element a1,2. counting
orders it is easily established that these are indeed the generators modulo g: aab,
a 6= b, along with,

ab

ij = i,j + pbi,aj,a,

(21)

where b = 1, 2, . . . n  2, are generators of mn1, which follows by induction on
n, i.e., the as are generators of mn1 modulo g. thus we count all the group
elements (pn1  p)m2
= pnm2
= |mn|. finally by acting with permutations, it is
enough to have m 12 and m pn1
, arriving at theorem (1).

the proof of theorem (2) uses a similar ltration. let n be the rank m matrices
over 2n. assume that the theorem holds for n  1, then by considering b  n
modulo 2n1, it follows that b is equal up to a similarity transformation to one of
the three classes, modulo 2n1. for the diagonal classes, we do not need to bother
as the theorem was proved earlier (it is the same as for any p). say, it is equal to

n =

0

mod 2n1,

(22)

the n is the same as n up to some addition of 2n1 in some entries. these can
be easily eliminated by the similarity transformations aa,b (for the entry (a, b)) or
m b for the entry (b, b). for type (ii) the proof is the same. we now use theorem

(1) to establish that the three types are distinct, since we used all the generators.

(of course we can still freely permute the rows and columns of the matrix, but this

does not change the result.)

8

it, thus, remains to prove the therem for n = 1. we use induction on m. say

n1,i = 1 mod 2, then also ni,1 = 1 mod 2. we can use these two elements to clean

the rst and ith rows and columns as above, except for these two elements. thus

we decompose o this matrix and the proof follows.

as an amusement the reader may wonder how theorem (1) works for rank 1
matrices, i.e., numbers m = 0, 1, 2, . . . , pn  1 modulo pn, which are 1 modulo
p. here we multiply m by pn1 + 1 enough times to make 0 < m < pn1 (this
is always possible since multiplying by it is like adding pn1). then we repeat
these steps inductively. when we continue we might have to keep multiplying with
pn1 + 1 for higher n to compensate for the fact that we are working modulo a
higher integer. this presents any integer modulo pn, which is 1 mod p, as a product
of the generators pb + 1, b = 1, 2, . . . n  1.

from theorem (2) it follows that, we need to worry only, p = 2, about rank

two, and ni = nj.

now, let us turn to the problem of realizing the nonregular automorphisms,

eq. (17). we employ the following alogarithm. first, from eq. (5) the central

charge is determined, c. we denote the lattice by m and its matrix of scalar

products by a, aij = ij, where i are the basis vectors for the lattice. we

assume that a is of the form,

a =

,

(23)

i.e., a is the same as the cartan matrix of su(n + 1) except for a replacement of
a 3  3 block at the top.

we run over all the possible matrices, a, where the coecients are in a certain

range, and the diagonal elements are positive integers (to describe an even lattice),
and also a2

ij < aiiajj to ensure that all the angles are real.

where the lower right hand side of the matrix is the dynkin matrix of su(n).

we nd for zk  zk with the nondiagonal automorphism and k = 2m:
1) m odd: m1 = u

k/2,k,1,k,k/2,0

,

1,k, k+8
2) m even: m2 = u

12 ,0,1, k

,

(the simplest case m = 1 also aords the lie algebra realization m = d8). it
can be checked that the determinant is k2 as it should and that the dimensions
and orders are those corresponding to the non-diagonal automorphism of zk  zk.
the characteristics of this are as follows:

1) all elements of m1 are of the form nij/k where nij are integers. the

diagonal elements ni,i are all even.

2) at least one nij is odd, say n,

3) if both n, and n, are 2 mod 4 it is an automorphism of type (ii). if not,

it is type (i).

we nd that m1 is always type (i), wheras m2 is always type (ii) except

for k = 4 where it is of type (i). the matrix h can be computed directly by
h = pm1
 .

to complete the realization, we nd for even m  4 the type (i) realizations:

m = u k/4,5k/16,5,k/4,k/2,7k/4

8

,

10

and for k = 4 an example of a type (ii) realization is,

m = u 4,5,2,4,4,1

8

.

for odd m the type (ii) realizations have c = 4 mod 8 and we nd,

m = u k,k,1,k,2k,0

4

,

as a realization.

this completes the realizations of all non regular automorphisms. the fore-

going discussion along with the results of ref.

[2] prove the following theorem,

previously conjectured in ref [1]:

theorem (3): all pseudo bosonic systems can be realized by ordinary bosons.

the actual realizations are given explicitly as ordinary bosons propagating on a

rational even lattice with an extended algebra of integral dimensions.

remark: actually we realized every modular matrix, s. to realize every pos-
sible t it is the same. we just need to replace |g| by 2|g|, i.e., h is dened modulo
2. the rest of the proof is identical, as is the result.
