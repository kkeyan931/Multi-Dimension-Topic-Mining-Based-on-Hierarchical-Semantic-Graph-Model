abstract

we propose the lattice version of bf gravity action whose partition func-
tion leads to the product of a particular form of 15-j symbol which corre-
sponds to a 4-simplex. the action is explicitly constructed by lattice b eld
dened on triangles and link variables dened on dual links and is shown
to be invariant under lattice local lorentz transformation and kalb-ramond
gauge transformation. we explicitly show that the partition function is pach-
ner move invariant and thus topological. the action includes the vanishing
holonomy constraint which can be interpreted as a gauge xing condition.
this formulation of lattice bf theory can be generalized into arbitrary di-
mensions.

1 introduction

in the mid 70s nobody expected that it was possible to evaluate the hadron masses

by any means in the near future. the later developments of lattice qcd made it

possible and gave us an idea that non-perturbative formulation of gauge theory on

the lattice is crucial for the realistic numerical analyses of the phenomena based on

the eld theory like qcd. as for the lepton and quark masses we dont have any

possible formulation at this moment.

it would, however, be not unreasonable to

expect that gravity theory might play a crucial role in the realistic unied model

leading to the lepton and quark spectrum calculations. on the other hand it is

quite natural to expect that some means to evaluate phenomenological numbers

numerically is obviously needed. we believe that a lattice theory will play again a

crucial role in the formulation. this line of thinking naturally encourages us to nd

a formulation of gravity theory on the lattice.

in 2-dimensional gravity the dynamical triangulation of lattice theory was very

successful analytically[1][2] and numerically[3][4] to evaluate the fractal dimensions[5].

the matrix model for the dynamical triangulation of random surface and the li-

ouville theory are the analytic means on one hand while the recursive sampling

method[3][4][6] and the ip op moves by monte-carlo are the numerical means on

the other in 2-dimensional quantum gravity. in general there is no local action to

describe the 2-dimensional quantum gravity.

in 3 dimensions einstein gravity has been successfully formulated by chern-

simons action as a gauge theory of iso(2, 1) group[7]. after turaev and viro[9]

proposed the possibility based on the analyses of q-deformed version of ponzano-

regge model that the ponzano-regge[8] model formulated by 6-j symbols may be

the lattice version of chern-simons gravity, there are several authors to try to prove

the connection of these two formulations[10][11]. the proofs of the connection has

been, however, indirect. in our recent paper we have shown by explicit calculations

that the partition function of the lattice version of chern-simons action indeed leads

to the ponzano-regge model[12].

in 4 dimensions ooguri pointed out the possibility that the partition function

of bf theory[13] leads to the partition function constructed from 15-j symbols[14].

this is quite parallel to the 3-dimensional case where the chern-simons gravity the-

ory is associated with the ponzano-regge model. this 4-dimensional proposal trig-

1

gered a new way of dening 4-dimensional quantum gravity theory by spin foam[15]

and a new type of 4-dimensional topological invariant by the quantum q-deformed

formulation[16][17].

there are plausible arguments that the partition function of the continuum bf

theory and 15-j symbols are related, but there is no explicit derivation to connect

the two models. here in this paper we rst introduce the lattice version of bf

theory and explicitly show that the partition function of the lattice bf theory leads

to the product of 15-j symbols. we then show explicitly that the particular com-

bination of 15-j product is pachner move invariant and thus the partition function

is independent how the 4-dimensional simplicial manifold is divided by the pachner

moves and is thus topological. then the continuum limit of the lattice bf theory

can be taken analytically and leads to the continuum bf action since the partition

function is division independent of the 4-dimensional simplicial manifold.

in formulating lattice gravity theory, we intend to couple the formulation of the

lattice qcd and regge calculus[18].

it has already been proposed that the link

variable of lattice qcd can be used to generate the curvature on the simplexes

where regge calculus claims as the location of gravitational curvature[19][20].

it is known that the bf theory is not equivalent to the einstein gravity but if
the 2-form b eld is related to the vierbein as b = (e  e), then the bf action
it is also known that the metric can be
leads to the einstein-hilbert action[21].

written by b eld directly if some constraints are fullled. in this case the einstein

gravity will be formulated by 2-form eld b and equations of motion. in this sense

the bf theory is closely related to the gravity theory but in the limited sense. the

lattice version of bf theory is, therefore, a very good starting point to the realistic

4-dimensional lattice gravity theory.

one of the authors (n.k.) and watabiki discovered the formulation to general-

ize the standard chern-simons action into arbitrary dimensions by employing all

degrees of form as gauge elds and parameters[22].

it was shown that the topo-

logical gravity and the topological conformal gravity can be formulated by 2- and

4-dimensional generalized chern-simons action[23]. we show concrete expressions

of the generalized chern-simons actions in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions where we omit

fermionic degrees for simplicity,

s2 = z tr{(d + 2) + 2b},

2

s3 = z str(cid:26)1
s4 = z tr{b(d + 2) + (d + {, }) + b2 + 2h},

3  (db + [, b]) + 2(cid:27) ,

which are invariant under the following gauge transformations:

 = [, v],

 = dv + [, v]  {, u},
b = du + {, u} + [b, v] + [, b],
 = db + [, b] + [, v]  {b, u} + {, u},
h = du  {, u} + {, u} + [h, v] + [b, b] + [, v ],

where [ , ] and { , } are, respectively, commutator and anti-commutator, and , ,
b, , h and v, u, b, u, v are, respectively, 0-, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-form gauge elds

and parameters. here odd forms of gauge elds and even forms of gauge param-

eters are ordinary even lie algebra valued elds while the rest of gauge elds and

parameters are odd super lie algebra valued elds[22]. since all these generalized

chern-simons actions are formulated by form degrees, the elds of forms are very

naturally accommodated on the simplicial manifold.

it is important for us to recognize that 3-dimensional chern-simons action and

4-dimensional bf action are the leading terms of the above generalized chern-

simons actions of s3 and s4. in the previous paper and present paper we focus on

the formulation of the leading terms of the 3- and 4-dimensional generalized chern-

simons action as the lattice gravity theory on a simplicial manifold. it is very natural

to generalize the lattice formulation of this paper to include all the form degrees of

the generalized chern-simons action on the lattice. we believe that the matter

eld will be accommodated via this generalized gauge theory formulation which

might lead to the unied theory including gravity on the simplicial manifold[24].

in this sense the bf action on the lattice is the good starting formulation for the

generalized gauge theory as well.

in section 2 we rst summarize the continuum formulation of bf theory then

introduce a lattice version of bf theory. since the lattice bf theory is a gauge

theory, we discuss the gauge invariance of the theory on the lattice in section 3. we

then integrate out the b elds and the link variables and then explicitly show that

the partition function of the lattice bf action leads to the product of 15-j symbols

3

in section 4. we then prove the pachner move invariance of our partition function

by graphical method explicitly in section 5. we summarize the result with several

discussions in the nal section.

2 formulation of the lattice bf theory

2.1 continuum bf theory

we rst summarize characteristics of the continuum 4-dimensional bf theory[13].

the action of bf theory is given by

sbf = zmhb, fi,

(2.1)

where m is 4-dimensional manifold. we take our gauge group any lie group g
whose lie algebra lg is equipped with an invariant nondegenerate bilinear form
h , i for the pair b and f . here f is curvature 2-form constructed from lie algebra
lg valued 1-form , and b is dual lie algebra l
g (= lg in the present case) valued
generic 2-form.

it has been noticed since quite sometime that the bf action leads to the palatini

type of einstein-hilbert action if we take the lie group g to be local lorentz group
and identify b = (e  e) with  as hodge dual operation to the local lorentz
suces. in particular the self dual component of the 2-form b plays a crucial role

in formulating the einstein gravity by the sl(2, c) spinor representation[21].

using the fact that the 4-dimensional euclidean version of local lorentz group
is a direct product of chiral su(2) groups: so(4)  su(2)l  su(2)r, we can
factorize the bf action with local lorentz group into the chiral parts,

a  f 

a and b

paper we only consider the one chiral, say left handed, counterpart of the action. we

may consider that the right-handed part is nothing but the copy of the left-handed

part, at least in the continuum limit. on the lattice there would be a possibility

to accommodate the same copy of chiral counterpart which we will discuss later. if

we take the left-chiral part of the action, we can formulate the lattice su(2) bf

4

theory by naive extension from 3-dimensional lattice chern-simons gravity into 4

dimensions.

in formulating left-chiral bf model, we can expand both b and f by the pauli

matrices, a (a = 1, 2, 3) since su(2) has self-dual lie algebra,

b =

1
2

baa, f =

1
2

f aa.

(2.3)

hereafter we omit the sux + to denote the left chirality. then the action of su(2)

bf theory leads to

sbf = zm

trbf =

1

2 zm

baf a,

(2.4)

where the trace is taken for the pauli matrices. it is worth to mention that the factor

2 dierence between the chiral part of bf action in (2.2) and the above action (2.4)

is due to the fact that the chiral decomposition of the fundamental representation

for so(4) generator is reducible into the direct sum of two pauli matrices.

there are two independent gauge transformations in this theory. one of them is

the local lorentz transformation,

 a = d a,

 ba = [b,  ]a,

(2.5)

where  is 0-form gauge parameter. there is another independent gauge transfor-

mation

ua = 0, uba = dua,

(2.6)

where ua is 1-form gauge parameter according to the 2-form nature of ba. this

transformation may be called kalb-ramond symmetry transformation[25] and cor-

responds to the dieomorphism transformation of dreibein e in 3 dimensions. this

transformation is on-shell reducible. in fact the following gauge change of the gauge

parameter u itself by 0-form gauge parameter va,

vua = dva,

(2.7)

leads to the vanishing contribution of the gauge change

v(uba) = dvua = ddva = [f, v]a = 0,

(2.8)

where we have used the equation of motion f = 0.

2.2 lattice bf gravity action

we intend to formulate a gravity version of lattice gauge theory where the product of

link variables u along the boundary of a square plaquette leads to the exponential

of curvature. thus we may identify the curvature locating at the center of the

plaquette and then the trace leads to the yang-mills action in the leading order of

the lattice constant in the lattice qcd. on the other hand regge calculus tells us

that the curvature is located at sites in 2 dimensions, links in 3 dimensions, triangles

in 4 dimensions and so on. it is thus very natural to formulate the gravity version of

lattice gauge theory in terms of the link variable u and take a product of u variables

surrounding the simplexes suggested by regge calculus[19][20].

in fact in 3 dimensions, we have successfully formulated lattice chern-simons

gravity based on the correspondence between the lattice gauge theory and regge
calculus[12]. the link variable u(l) = e(l) is dened on the dual link l which is
located on the boundary of dual plaquette p . since the dual of the dual plaquette
p is original link l which intersect p in 3 dimensions, the curvature is located

in the center of the dual plaquette or equivalently on the original link and thus

consistent with the regge calculus. we needed to introduce vanishing holonomy

constraint which enforces the parallelism of the dreibein ea and the lattice curvature
f a  1
formulated in this way exactly coincides with that of the ponzano-regge model.

2abcf bc to obtain gravity theory.

it turns out that the partition function

then the action leads to the continuum chern-simons gravity since the ponzano-

regge partition function is alexander move invariant and thus invariant under the

division of the simplicial manifold and then the naive continuum limit can be taken.

in this paper we extend the formulation of 3-dimensional lattice gravity into

4 dimensions. we formulate a lattice version of su(2) bf theory. we consider a

piecewise linear 4-dimensional simplicial manifold. according to the regge calculus,

curvature is located at a triangle t. there are in general several 4-simplexes which
have the triangle t in common. a dual link l is dened as the line connecting

the center of neighbouring 4-simplexes and is located on the boundary of the dual
plaquette p . we introduce dual link variables u(l) = ei(l) on the dual link l . then
the product of the dual link variables u(l) along the boundary of the dual plaquette

in [12] we have used anti-hermitian generators of so(3) and thus denoted the link variable
as u = e while here we use hermitian generators of su (2) and thus denote the link variable as
u = ei.

6

p leads to a curvature located on the center of the dual plaquette p which coincides

with the center of the triangle t in 4 dimensions. we then locate the 2-form eld b

on the original triangle t. see fig.1.

we dene the curvature f (t) located on the triangle t by the following equa-

tion:

(cid:13) u(l)  eif (t).
yl p

(2.9)

the leading term in f with respect to the lattice unit is the ordinary curvature
d + 2 similar in structure to the ordinary lattice gauge theory, but here we dene

the lattice curvature f in such a way that it contains all orders of terms of lattice

unit.

using these variables, we consider the following lattice version of the bf action:

slbf = xt

ib(t)hln yl p

(cid:13) u(l)i

ba(t)f a(t).

(2.10)

in formulating continuum chern-simons gravity in 3 dimensions, we need to

impose a torsion free condition as an equation of motion at the classical level. the

torsion free nature is lost at the quantum level when we integrate out the dreibein

and spin connection. in formulating lattice chern-simons gravity and showing the

equivalence with the ponzano-regge model in 3 dimensions, we needed to introduce

the following vanishing holonomy constraint which relates the dreibein and spin

connection even at the quantum level:

(cid:13) u(l)iab
h yl p

eb = ea,

(2.11)

where a, b are so(3) suces. this constraint has been interpreted as a gauge xing

condition of lattice gauge dieomorphism transformation. geometrically the con-

straint is equivalent to the parallelism of the dreibein and the curvature: ea  f a,
where f a  1

2abcf bc.

in contrast with the 3-dimensional case we introduce the following constraint in

4 dimensions








(cid:13) u(l)
 b
(cid:13) u(l)
 yl p
 yl p



= b,

(2.12)

where  are suces of su(2) spinor representation. geometrically the constraint

means that the each of spinor sux of b eld located at the center of a triangle

can be parallel transported in the opposite direction along the boundary of the
dual plaquette p and comes back to the starting point and should coincide with

the original direction and thus the holonomy of each sux vanishes. we now derive

more concrete expression for the constraint (2.12) which is equivalent to the following

relations:



this equation can be satised if

[f, b] = iabcf abb c

(2.13)

(2.14)

or equivalently ba  f a.

analogous to the arguments in 3 dimensions, the constraint thus leads to the
parallelism of the 2-form ba and the curvature: ba  f a. more precisely the
constraint can be rewritten in a concrete form by taking into account the parallel

and antiparallel nature of ba and f a

(2.15)

where |b|  baba and |f|  f af a are the length of ba and f a, respectively.
the term b3/|b| is needed to keep the rotational invariance of the expression.

one of the important characteristic of the lattice bf action (2.10) is that the
discreteness of the length of the 2-form eld |b| comes out as a natural consequence
of the specic choice of the logarithmic action. we rst note the following identity:

ei|f |i = cos |f|

where i = f a

8

(2.16)

(2.17)

using the above relation and f a  ba by the constraint (2.12), we nd that our

lattice bf action slbf has the following ambiguity:

slbf = xt
= xt

tr(cid:16)ib(t) ln ef (t)(cid:17)
tr(cid:16)ib(t) ln ef (t)+i4ni(cid:17)

= slbf +

2 xt

4n|b(t)|.

this ambiguity leads to an ambiguity in the partition function

z = z dudb eislbf = z dudb eislbf +ipt 2n|b|.

(2.18)

imposing the single valuedness of eislbf , we obtain the constraint that pt |b(t)|
should be integer, or equivalently |b(t)| should be integer. we can now write down
the explicit form of partition function with constraints

z = z dudb (cid:18)(cid:16)y(cid:13) u(l)(cid:17) b(cid:16)y(cid:13) u(l)(cid:17)

 b(cid:19)xn

(|b|  n)eislbf ,

(2.19)

where n  z.

it is important to notice that the length of the 2-form |b(t)| is proportional to the
area of triangle t on which the 2-form eld ba(t) is dened. it is then interesting to

note that the area of the triangle is discretized due to the logarithmic form of our

lattice bf action. it has already been pointed out by rovelli and smolin that the

area of triangle in 4-dimensional gravity is discretized in the square root of angular

momentum square qj(j + 1) by investigating an area operator[26]. the origin of

the discreteness of the area of triangle in our formulation is quite dierent from that

of rovelli and smolin.

3 gauge invariance on the lattice

the gauge transformations of the continuum bf theory have been given by the local

lorentz transformation (2.5) and the kalb-ramond transformation (2.6). under the

local lorentz transformation both of the b eld and curvature f transform adjointly

in the continuum theory

 ba = [b,  ]a,

 f a = [f,  ]a.

(3.1)

9

we consider that the lattice versions of the local lorentz gauge parameters are

located on the dual sites and the center of the original triangles, the same point
where the b eld is located. then the dual link variable u(l) = ei(l) transforms

under the lattice local lorentz transformation as

u(l)  v 1u(l)v ,

(3.2)

where v = exp(cid:16) i

the neighboring site. then the following lattice counterpart of the local lorentz

2 aa(cid:17) is the su(2) matrix on the dual site and v  is the one on

transformation:

b(t)  v 1b(t)v,
f (t)  v 1f (t)v,
leads to the obvious invariance of the action (2.4).

(3.3)

there are, however, some subtleties on the gauge invariance of the lattice action

due to the fact that the center of the triangle where b eld is located and the
dual links where dual link variables u(l) are located are not connected by a link

variable u. we can arbitrarily choose a dual site and introduce new link variable to

bridge between the dual site and the center of the original triangle to identify the

lattice local lorentz transformation. the newly dened link variables, however, can

be gauged away. the details of these arguments go parallel to the 3-dimensional

chern-simons gravity case and can be found in [12].

next we will investigate the lattice version of kalb-ramond transformation.

since the invariance nature of the continuum action under this transformation is

due to the bianchi identity,

df = df + [, f ] = 0,

(3.4)

we need to identify bianchi identity on the lattice. we will consider the integrated

version of the bianchi identity,

zm

df = zm

f +zm

[, f ] = 0,

(3.5)

where m is a 3-dimensional manifold corresponding to the 3-form nature of df in

(3.4).

in 3 dimensions the geometrical structure of the manifold m can be visually

well understood since the dual cell of a original site associated to the 0-form gauge

parameter of the gauge dieomorphism transformation is easily recognized. this

d, e and f are sites and acdef , abcef , abcdf , bcdef are the centers
of 4-simplex. thick lines are the dual links and thin lines are original links.

type of setup was just what we needed to show the 3-dimensional lattice counterpart

of the bianchi identity[12].

correspondingly in 4 dimensions, we have to consider the dual cell of the original

link cf as a 3-dimensional simplicial submanifold m since the gauge parameter of

the kalb-ramond transformation (2.6), which we now identify as the parameter

on the link cf , is 1-form in 4 dimensions. in general the 3-dimensional cell dual

to a given link may have complicated simplicial structure. for simplicity we here

consider the dual cell as a tetrahedron. the tetrahedron as the dual cell has four

dual sites which correspond to the center of original 4-simplexes. we then need

to introduce four original sites a, b, d and e to obtain four 4-simplexes which

share the common link cf as shown in fig.2. with this setup we can discuss the

invariance of the lattice bf action (2.10) under a lattice version of kalb-ramond

transformation.

we introduce the following notations: u1  uacdef abcdf is a dual link
variable on the dual link which connect the dual sites or equivalently the cen-

ter of original links denoted as acdef and abcdf . the 2-form gauge eld
bdxdx is located on the center of the triangle bcf . the 1-form

b1  zbcf
gauge parameter u0  zf c

gauge parameter v1  v(b) is located on the original site b. here we summarize

(3.9)

(3.10)

which can be evaluated order by order of the curvature f by using the baker-

hausdor formula. we identify (3.9) as the lattice version of the bianchi identity

(3.4).

now we consider the lattice version of the gauge transformation for the 2-form

gauge eld bk. we rst note that b1 eld is located on the center of the triangle

12

bcf and thus the gauge transformation of b1 eld is associated with the gauge

parameters u0, u1 and u2 located on the boundary f c, cb and bf , respectively.

then the lattice version of bk transformation will be given as follows:

2k1, u2k1]  [

2k, u2k],

(3.11)

bk = u0 + u2k1 + u2k  [k, u0]  [
2k1 and 

where k is dened in (3.10) while 

2k are the similar quantities associated
with the gauge parameters u2k1 and u2k dened on the links just as k is associated

with the gauge parameter u0 on the link f c. then the transformation of the action

leads to

xk=1

2k1, u2k1]  [

2k, u2k](cid:17) fk(cid:17) +   

where in the last expression we have only picked up the terms associated with u0. we

can identify this transformation as the kalb-ramond transformation on the lattice.

thus the lattice bf action is invariant under the transformation (3.11) due to the

lattice version of bianchi identity (3.9).

in 4 dimensions the kalb-ramond transformation is on-shell reducible. we now

show how the reducibility of the 2-form gauge transformation is realized on the

lattice. due to the equation of motion f = 0, we obtain  = 0 since  is a

polynomial of f as we can see in the denition (3.10). hence the transformation of

b in (3.11) can be reduced as follows:

bk = u2k1 + u2k + u0,

(3.12)

which corresponds to the continuum gauge transformation (2.6). considering the

continuum reducibility relation, we identify the transformation of 1-form gauge pa-

rameter u dened on a link as the dierence of 0-form gauge parameter dened on

a site,

u(ab) = v(b)  v(a),

(3.13)

13

more explicitly,

u2k = v5  vk,
u2k1 = vk  v6,
u0 = v6  v5.

(3.14)

then the continuum reducibility relation (2.8) leads to

(bk) = (vk  v6) + (v5  vk) + (v6  v5) = 0,

(3.15)

on the lattice. we can consider that this result is corresponding to the on-shell

reducibility of the kalb-ramond transformation on the lattice.

we now point out that the constraint (2.12) or equivalently (2.15) breaks the

lattice version of kalb-ramond transformation while the lattice bf action itself is

invariant under the transformation as shown in the above. the lattice b eld is

transformed but the lattice curvature is unchanged under the kalb-ramond gauge

transformation. therefore we can use a part of degrees of freedom of the lattice

1-form gauge parameter uk to align the 2-form ba eld and the curvature f a in

of freedom of the 1-form gauge parameter ua

accordance with the constraint. in fact the reducibility allows the total gauge degrees
 to be 433 = 9, while the parallel or
 and f a
 needs 6  3/2 = 9 constraints
where we have taken into account the chiral nature for the space-time sux as well.

anti-parallel nature of the 2-form chiral ba

there are thus necessary degrees of freedom to fulll the constraint. the 3 degrees

of freedom out of 9 should be exhausted to adjust the discrete nature of the ba

eld. we now claim that the vanishing holonomy constraint can be identied as the

gauge xing condition of the kalb-ramond gauge transformation on the lattice.

4 calculation of the partition function

in our previous paper we have explicitly shown that 3-dimensional version of lattice

chern-simons action with the constraint of vanishing holonomy along dual links

leads to the ponzano-regge model formulated by 6-j symbol[12]. analogously to

the 3-dimensional case we explicitly show that the lattice version of bf action (2.10)

with the vanishing holonomy constraint (2.12) leads to a topological gravity model

formulated by 15-j symbol in 4 dimensions.

the partition function with the constraint (2.12) or equivalently (2.15) and the

where zt is the part of partition function associated with a triangle t. we have

d|b| = z |bf |

|bi|



xj=0

 (|b|  2j) d|b|,

(4.3)

where j  z/2 and thus |bf| and |bi| should be integer.

we can now evaluate the b integral of zt straightforwardly thanks to the delta

functions and obtain

at this stage it is important to recognize that arbitrary change of the normalization

zt = xj

8j 2 cos(j|f|).

(4.4)

constant for the lattice bf action (2.10) gives the same result for (4.4). this can

be understood by the following arguments: suppose we take the action of the form
slbf = 

2 pt ba(t)f a(t), we need to take |b(t)| = 2j (j  z/2), based on the

similar arguments as in section 2. taking into account the vanishing holonomy

constraint (2.12) or equivalently (2.15), the action essentially leads to the form

slbf = pt j|f (t)| and thus to (4.4).

using the following formula for the character j of the spin-j representation of

su(2),

j (eiaja) = j (||) =

where || is the length of a, we nd

sin(cid:16)(2j + 1) ||
2 (cid:17)
sin(cid:16) ||

,

j (|f|)  j1(|f|) = 2 cos(j|f|).

hence we can naively calculate the triangle partition function,

this calculation is not precise, because the summation is not convergent. we can,

however, justify the above calculation by introducing the heat kernel regularization.

the details of the regularization procedure can be found in our previous paper[12].

integrating out b eld and introducing heat kernel regularization and dividing

the unimportant constant factor, we obtain the total partition function

z = z du yt



xj=0

(cid:13) u(l)(cid:17) ej(j+1) ,

(4.7)

where a regularization parameter  is introduced. the parameter  will be sent to
zero (  0) at the end of calculation.

it is interesting to note that the formulation has close similarity with the 3-

dimensional case. in 3 dimensions the angular momentum j is associated to the

original link while it is associated to a triangle in 4 dimensions. this has natural

correspondence with regge calculus in the sense that the discretized angular mo-

mentum j is localized at the simplexes where the gravitational curvature is localized.
we now carry out du integration of this partition function. thanks to the
character of the partition function, du integration is straightforward. we rst note
the following relation specic to the character:

j(cid:16) yl p

(cid:13) u(l)(cid:17) = x{ki}

yi=1

kiki+1(ui)

(km+1 = k1),

(4.8)

where dj
kiki+1(ui) is the d-function, a spin j matrix representation for a su(2)
group element ui  u(li) located on the dual link li. here we assume that there are
m dual link variables ui along the boundary of dual plaquette p .

we then clear out the geometrical structure of a 4-simplex. a 4-simplex can

be constructed by ve sites for which we name a, b, c, d and e. we may denote

the 4-simplex itself composed of these sites as abcde, which has ve tetrahedra

bcde, acde, abde, abce and abcd on the boundary. each tetrahedron,

such as bcde, has boundary triangles cde, bde, bce and bcd and so on. in

this way we can specify all the simplexes included in the 4-simplex abcde. we

can graphically denotes the geometrical structure of the 4-simplex abcde. see

fig.3.

we now clarify the locations of the ui and d-functions on the 4-simplexes. the

center of the gure in fig.3 is corresponding to that of the 4-simplex abcde which

has ve neighboring 4-simplexes and is connected to the 4-simplexes by ve dual

links denoted by the thick lines. the ve points on the ve thick lines correspond

to the center of the ve boundary tetrahedra, bcde, acde, abde, abce and

abcd, respectively. arrows on the dual links indicate the direction of the dual link
variables ui, u 

i and the thin lines with arrows indicate the direction of the product of
the d-functions. as we can see in (4.8) the product of the d-functions goes around

a original triangle associated with the representation j. for example the boundary

triangle between the tetrahedra abcd and abce is abc and thus there is a thin

line going from abcd to abce. thus there are 10 thin lines corresponding to

the number of surrounding triangles. it should be noted that there are two dual link
variables ui and u 
by the boundary tetrahedron and is located on the same dual link li.

i each of which belongs to the neighboring 4-simplexes separated

before getting into the details we briey gure out how 15-j symbols appear

after the du integration. as we have shown in fig.3, there are ve boundary tetra-

hedra in a 4-simplex. each tetrahedron has four triangles and thus there are four

thin lines carrying d-functions associated to a du integration. since each du inte-

gration for the product of four d-functions reproduces four 3-j symbols, we obtain

twenty 3-j symbols for each 4-simplex. then the ten out of the twenty 3-j sym-

bols lead to a 15-j symbols and the rest of the ten 3-j symbols together with those

from the neighbouring 4-simplex reproduce a trivial factor 2j + 1 attached to each

tetrahedron.

we now explicitly show how the 15-j symbols appear after the du integration.

17

as a concrete example we focus on the du1du

dron bcde of the 4-simplex abcde. there appear eight d-functions in du1du

the factor 2l + 1 can be understood to be associated with the tetrahedron bcde.

two 3-j symbols carrying sux mi which is assigned to be related to the center

of 4-simplex abcde, will be used to construct the 15-j symbol associated with
4-simplex abcde, while the other two 3-j symbols carrying the sux m

i, will
be used to construct the 15-j symbol associated with the neighboring 4-simplex of

abcde which share the common tetrahedron bcde.

hereafter we introduce a graphical method to explain the manipulation of for-

mulae and the derivation leading to the generalized 15-j symbol. the essence of

this method is to represent the 3-j symbol graphically by trivalent vertex (3-vertex)

with a sign factor. the sign is related to the correspondence between the order-

ing of column in the 3-j symbol and right- or left-handed ordering of the angular

momentum ji on the trivalent graph. we choose to dene the following particular

ordering and the sign factor:

where the rules for the signs on the vertices and the arrows on the lines can be un-

and can be represented by closed trivalent graph with ten vertices with sign factors.

it is important to recognize that the corresponding sign factors are the same in

each pair of the four internal line diagrams. in the above particular example we
have chosen the dual link integration du1du 
1 via the boundary tetrahedron bcde
and obtained the integrated result ibcde. we need to carry out four other dual
link integrations; du2du 

5 to perform the full dual link
integration of the 4-simplex abcde. they can be carried out in the same way as
du1du

the decuplet graph (4.18) is the denition of our generalized 15-j symbol. there

are ten peripheral lines and ve internal lines. the internal lines correspond to the

tetrahedra which originally come from the one of the internal lines of the corre-

sponding graph in (4.14). the peripheral lines correspond to the common triangle

between the neighboring tetrahedra of internal lines. for example the peripheral line

bde is connected with two internal lines abde and bcde and thus corresponds

to the common boundary of the two tetrahedra.

we can now obtain the full expression of our partition function in terms of

generalized 15-j symbols after we carry out db integration for all the triangles and

dui integration for all the dual links whose dual are the boundary tetrahedra of each

4-simplex,

zlbf = x{ji} ytriangle

(2j + 1) ytetrahedron

(2j + 1) y4-simplex{15-j},

(4.20)

where we have written the 15-j symbol symbolically. the factor (2j +1) attached to

a triangle is originated from the same factor as in (4.7) appeared after db integration

on a triangle. the second factor (2j + 1) attached to a tetrahedron is originated

from the same factor as in the graph (4.17) appeared after du integration for each

tetrahedron (dual to dual link). here we have not yet given the explicit form of the

generalized 15-j symbol with the following reasons. as we have already pointed out

in the graphical representation (4.14) and (4.15), there are sign ambiguity for the

3-j representation in the du integration, which is reected to the denition of our

generalized 15-j symbol. in the next section we determine this sign ambiguity by

imposing the topological invariance on the partition function zlbf expressed by the

15-j symbols in (4.20). the topological invariance of the partition function on the

4-dimensional simplicial manifold can be assured if the partition function is pachner

move invariant, which we will explain in the next section.

23

we conclude this section with a few comments. in the ooguris symbolic presen-

tation of the partition function there appear 6-j symbols in addition to 15-j symbols

while we dont have this 6-j symbols in the partition function. our denition of the

generalized 15-j symbol is almost the same as that of crane-yetter[16] except for

the denition of sign factors.

5 pachner move invariance of the partition func-

tion

in 3-dimensional lattice gravity formulations, it was shown that the lattice chern-

simons gravity leads to the ponzano-regge model constructed from 6-j symbol[12]

which has close correspondence with 3-simplex, tetrahedron. the crucial point of

the ponzano-regge model is that the particular product of 6-j symbols of the model

is alexander move (2-3 move and 1-4 move or equivalently 3-dimensional pachner

move) invariant[9][10][11]. since the ponzano-regge model is independent how the

3-dimensional simplicial manifold is divided by the moves and thus the model is

topological. then in the 3-dimensional case the continuum limit can be trivially

taken and therefore the lattice chern-simons gravity action leads to the continuum

iso(3) chern-simons gravity action.

in 4 dimensions it is expected that the story proceeds quite parallel as in the

3-dimensional case. our lattice bf gravity action has led to the partition function

constructed from 15-j symbol which has close correspondence with 4-simplex.

as we have already mentioned that any kinds of 15-j symbols can be represented

by the closed trivalent graph which has ten vertices. dierent types of 15-j symbols

are essentially distinguished by the topology of the graph. for example there are

ve kinds of standard 15-j symbols which can be decomposed into the product of

6-j and 9-j symbols[27]. our generalized 15-j symbol graphically given in (4.18) is

dierent from the standard 15-j symbol and thus we have called the 15-j symbol of

(4.18) as generalized 15-j symbol.

in the graphical representation of the generalized 15-j symbol, we have not yet

specied the sign factors on the trivalent vertices. here in this section we show

that those sign factors are determined by imposing the 4-dimensional pachner move

invariance to the product of the partition function (4.20).

it is the known fact that any 4-dimensional simplicial manifold can be con-

24

structed out of 4-dimensional pachner moves which are composed of n-m moves with

n + m = 6 in 4 dimensions. thus they include 1-5 move, 2-4 move, 3-3 move and the

inverse of the 1-5 and 2-4 moves[28]. there are essentially three independent moves;

1-5 move, 2-4 move and 3-3 move to reproduce an arbitrary shape of 4-dimensional

simplicial manifold. those moves are shown in fig.4. in the 1-5 move the center

dotted link ab is the common link of the nal four 4-simplexes. for example in 2-4

move, the initial conguration of a 4-dimensional simplicial manifold including two

4-simplexes (acdef ) and (bcdef ) will be changed into another simplicial man-

ifold including four 4-simplexes (abdef ), (abcef ), (abcdf ) and (abcde)

after the 2-4 move of pachner type.

in 3-dimensional case the alexander move invariance of the ponzano-regge

model is shown explicitly by several ways[9][10][11]. since in 4 dimensions the ex-

plicit proof of the pachner move invariance of the partition function of 15-j symbol

type has not yet been given, we explicitly show the invariance here by a graphical

method. there is a proposal of proof of pachner move invariance by crane and

yetter who used the similar quantum 15-j symbol as ours but didnt show explicit

proof[16]. furthermore there is some sign factor dierence from ours in the deni-

tion of 15-j symbol. mathematically there are similar treatments of topologically

invariant quantity in 4 dimensions[17].

in order to show the pachner move invariance of the partition function (4.20)

graphically, we need three crucial formulae. the analytic and the corresponding

graphical expressions of the formulae are given in the following. we may call an

25

expression to be closed if all the third components of the angular momentum are

summed up. then if there are two closed expressions each of which has two 3-j

symbols with the common magnitude of angular momentum, they can be connected

into one closed expression as follows:

we now explicitly show the invariance of the partition function (4.20) under the

4-2 pachner move graphically by using the above formulae. the 4-2 move is simply

the inverse of 2-4 move and includes all the necessary manipulations. the 5-1 and

3-3 pachner move invariance can be proved in the similar way. we will abbreviate

the summation of j and factors (2j + 1) in the following graphical calculation.

we rst display four decuplet diagrams corresponding to the four 4-simplexes in

particular rule. we rst note that the boundary of the initial four 4-simplexes should

coincide with the boundary of the nal two simplexes with correct orientations. with

the help of homological algebraic notations, we obtain the following relation:

(abcde)  (abcdf )  (abdef ) + (abcef )

= (bcdef )  (acdef )
= bcde  acde  bdef + adef

bcdf + acdf + bcef  acef,

(5.9)

where the boundary operator  is dened by

(abcde) = bcde  acde + abde  abce + abcd.

(5.10)

in the rst row of the decuplet diagrams in the following rst equation, we have

shown the 4-simplex abcde where the internal lines corresponding to tetrahedra

are arranged in the order starting from bcde and then acde with common

triangle cde and so on as in the order of (5.10). in the second row of the rst

decuplet diagrams, we show the 4-simplex abcdf with the opposite arrows with

respect to the diagram abcde reecting the sign dierence in (5.9). for example

the arrow of bcde for the 4-simplex abcde in (1) is the opposite to the arrow

28

of bcdf for the 4-simplex abcdf in (2), which are located on the same position

of each decouplet. we then display the 4-simplexes abdef and abcef with the

same rule in the rst column of the equations.

in the rst equality we have used the formula (5.1) for the internal lines of

tetrahedra abcd and abef to combine two diagrams (1) and (2) into (5) and

(3) and (4) into (6), respectively.

in the second equality we have again used the

formula (5.1) for the common internal lines abce to combine the diagrams (5)

and (6) into (7). in the third equality, we have used the formula (5.2) to get rid of

abe and then abde successively in (7) and reached the diagram (8). similarly

in the forth equality abc and abcf are removed from (8) into (9). in the fth

equality we have used the relations (5.6) and (5.8) since there is a closed loop with
two internal tetrahedra; abdf  abd  abdf  abf  abdf in the
diagram (9). in the sixth equality we rearranged the diagram (10) in the form of

diagram (11). in the last equality we have used again the formula (5.1) in the inverse

order to reproduce the internal line of tetrahedron cdef .

we have thus shown that the product of initial four decuplet diagrams is equiva-

lent to the product of the nal two decuplet diagrams multiplied by the regularized

constant . thus the product of the 15-j symbols of the partition function (4.20)

can be decomposed into another product by the 4-2 move. the proof of 5-1 and 3-3

move invariance of the partition function proceeds quite parallel to the proof of 4-2

33

move. in the treatment of 5-1 move, we actually obtain the regularization factor 4,

while 3-3 move does not reproduce any regularization factor.

we rst note that in 4-2 move there is a common link for the initial four 4-

simplexes while there is a common site for the initial ve 4-simplexes in 5-1 move.

we then ask how many powers of  we need to be compatible with the pachner

moves. we rst count the change of the number of i-simplexes ni before and after

the pachner moves. we list the result in table 1.

table 1: the dierence of the number of simplexes before and after the pachner
moves.

since we have obtained 4 in 5-1 move and  in 4-2 move, we need to obtain

the following ai satisfying:

a0 + 5a1 + 10a2 + 10a3 + 4a4 = 4,

a1 + 4a2 + 5a3 + 2a4 = 1.

(5.11)

then the total power of  of the 4-dimensional simplicial manifold in consideration

will be given by

i=0

aini.

(5.12)

p4

there are the following well known relations among the total number of i-simplex

ni in 4-dimensional simplicial manifold[29]:

n0  n1 + n2  n3 + n4 = ,
2n1  3n2 + 4n3  5n4 = 0,

2n3 = 5n4,

(5.13)

where  is euler number. solving n2, n3 and n4 in terms of n0 and n1 in (5.13),

we obtain the power of  as

4

xi=0

aini = n0(a010a215a36a4)+n1(a1 +4a2 +5a3 +2a4)+(10a2 +15a3 +6a4).
(5.14)

34

as far as ai satises the relation (5.11), we can arbitrarily take the integer ai. taking

the choice a2 = a3 = a4 = 0, we obtain euler number independent solution of the 

power dependence,

n0+n1.

to summarize we obtain the pachner move invariant partition function,

zlbf = x{ji}ysite

1ylink

 ytriangle

(2j + 1) ytetrahedron

(2j + 1) y4-simplex{15-j}.

(5.15)

(5.16)

finally we give arguments to determine the sign factors of the 15-j symbols. we

rst note that the decuplet graph of our 15-j symbol with any given sign factor

conguration is equal to the one that has reversed all sign factors,

-

(5.17)

we can thus take the sign factor of one particular vertex + without loss of generality.

we then take the following special choice of one sign factor for the initial four 4-

simplexes of 4-2 move:

when we consider an arbitrary 4-dimensional simplicial manifold composed of

4-simplexes, any of two neighboring 4-simplexes have one boundary tetrahedron

in common.

in the corresponding expression of this simplicial manifold by the

generalized 15-j symbols, there are thus always the same pair of internal lines in

the decuplet diagrams. as we have already mentioned in (4.14) and (4.15), the sign

factors of two vertices associated to the same tetrahedron should be the same. using

this fact, we can determine the other sign factors of initial four 4-simplexes of 4-2

move up to the ve unknown sign ambiguities denoted by , , ,  and

the sign conguration of the decuplet graphs before and after the 4-2 move

this requirement leads to the following relations:

(5.19)

we have thus obtained several constraints from the consistency of 4-2 move.

we can use the similar arguments as 4-2 move for 5-1 and 3-3 moves to get

constraints on the sign ambiguity. it turns out that 4-2 move and 5-1 move eventually

give the same constraint,

6 conclusion and discussions

we have shown that the partition function of the lattice version of bf action with

vanishing holonomy constraint leads to the product of 15-j symbols with some par-

ticular combinations of angular momentum factors and regularized constants. we

have then explicitly proved by graphical method that the partition function is pach-

ner move invariant if we take particular choice of sign assignments for the trivalent

vertices of decuplet diagrams corresponding to the 4-simplexes. this means that

the partition function is independent of how the simplicial manifold is divided by

4-simplexes. this is to do with the fact that the partition function of the lattice

version of bf action is dieomorphism invariant or even topological invariant in a

stronger sense. since the partition function is invariant how much nely we divide

the 4-dimensional simplicial manifold in consideration, the continuum limit of the

lattice bf action is expected to approach naively to the continuum bf action. the

vanishing holonomy constraint can be then interpreted as a gauge xing condition

to align the ba eld and the curvature f a.

there are some desirable features in this formulation. firstly we have found the

lattice formulation of 4-dimensional gravity which is rst order formalism and is

thus described by local variable b and spin connection u = ei. this is the rst

4-dimensional example of lattice gravity model which species the location of the

local elds b which could possibly be related to the metric and the lattice spin con-

nection u = ei on the 4-dimensional simplicial manifold. this lattice formulation

is a beautiful unication of the idea of lattice qcd and the formulation of regge

calculus in the sense that the curvature generated by the product of link variables

are concentrated on the simplexes where regge calculus claims as the location of

gravitational curvature. secondly the magnitude of the b eld is naturally dis-

cretized due to the logarithmic form of our lattice bf action. thus the discreteness

of the area of triangles on the original lattice is a natural consequence of the action.

it should be compared with the result of rovelli and smolin who claimed to get the

area operator[26].

discreteness of the area of triangles in the form qj(j + 1) from the analysis of an
as we have already pointed out that the identication of b = (ee) renders the
bf action into the palatini type of einstein-hilbert action. on the other hand in

our bf action we have taken the gauge algebra as one of the chiral counter part of

39

so(4) algebra in the decomposition of the euclidean local lorentz group, so(4) 
su(2)l  su(2)r. there are several possibilities how the chiral decomposition of
the local lorentz group be related to the realistic einstein-hilbert action[21]. here

a with the
gauge group as one of the chiral partner su(2)l will be formulated on the original

we simply comment an interesting possibility that the action rm b+
lattice as in this paper while the action rm b

a f +

a with the other chiral partner
su(2)r gauge group will be formulated on the dual lattice. this situation can be

a f 

symbolically be written

zlbf [so(4)] = zlbf [su(2)l]  zlbf [su(2)r].

(6.1)

in order that this theory be realistic lattice gravity model, we need some natural

constraint to relate the two chiral bf models. as we have mentioned in the end

of section 3, the vanishing holonomy constraint (2.12) includes 9 relations for the

chiral partner of the so(4) algebra, which is just the necessary irreducible degrees

of freedom for the 1-form gauge parameter. in order to count the number of the

constraint, we have assumed the chiral nature even for the spacetime sux in ad-

dition to the local lorentz gauge sux. in fact there are 9 other constraints in the

vanishing holonomy constraint, which may correspond to the number of constraints

of the spacetime sux of the other chiral partner. it is interesting to note that the

vanishing holonomy constraint (2.12) may include both constraint in one relation,

which might give some clue to nd a realistic lattice gravity model.

our proposed lattice bf action (2.10) can be generalized into arbitrary dimen-

sions. in fact iso(3) chern-simons gravity was formulated by the 3-dimensional

version of lattice bf action. we claim that d-dimensional lattice bf action has

the universal structure

slbf = xx

tr
x(x)hln yl p

(cid:13) u(l)i
 ,

(6.2)

where x(x) is (d  2)-form located on the center of (d  2)-simplex, x, in the
d-dimensional simplicial manifold. the lattice curvature term is dened in the

similar way as the 3- and 4-dimensional cases. it should be noted that the center
of the dual plaquette p coincides with the center of the simplex x. the vanishing

holonomy constraint may have the form either the type of (2.11) or the type (2.12)

depending on the sux structure of gauge group for x. it is worth to recognize at

40

this stage that this lattice bf action is the lattice version of the leading term in

the generalized chern-simons action in d dimensions.

in our lattice gravity formulation in 3 and 4 dimensions, 1- and 2-form elds

are, respectively, introduced on 1- and 2-simplexes in the simplicial manifold: ea

and ba are located on the link (1-simplex) and the triangle (2-simplex) of original

lattice, respectively, while u = ei is located on the dual link (1-simplex). there

is thus natural correspondence between the form degrees and the simplex numbers.

the generalized gauge theory which is formulated to include all form degrees may

thus very naturally be tting to the formulation of gauge theory on the simplicial

manifold.

we know that there is no dynamical graviton in the topological model while we

need the graviton as a dynamical eld in the realistic 4-dimensional einstein gravity.

we believe that matter elds should be introduced to accommodate the dynamical

degrees of freedom and thus would change the topological nature of the model. we

know by now that the ghosts introduced by the quantization will be changed into

fermionic matter elds via twisting mechanism[30]. in fact we found a mechanism

that r symmetry of n = 2 supersymmetry in the twist is essentially related to

the dirac-kahler fermion formulation[31]. the dirac-kahler fermion needs all form

degrees of freedom and can naturally be put on the simplicial manifold.

it will be thus interesting to investigate lattice gravity formulation with matter

elds on the simplicial manifold. we know that weak boson gauge eld and higgs

eld can be very naturally accommodated into the generalized gauge theory formu-

lation and thus this kind of formulation possibly leads to the unied model on the

simplicial manifold[24].

in our formulation we have introduced cut o dependent regularized constant. it

is well known by the work of turaev and viro that the regularization of the ponzano-

regge model can be naturally accommodated if we introduce the q-deformed for-

mulation of 3-j symbol[9]. we didnt mention the q-deformed version of the present

formulation in this paper although it is the main subject among mathematicians to

obtain the 4-dimensional topological invariant by the q-deformed formulation[17].

since our 15-j symbol is explicitly related to the 3-j symbol which has the q-

deformed counterpart, it will be straightforward to generalize our formulation into

q-deformed version, which is expected to correspond with bf gravity with cosmo-

41

logical term[10][15].
