abstract

there are two families of non-bps bi-spinors in the perturbative spectrum of the
nine dimensional heterotic string charged under the gauge group so(16) so(16). the
relation between these perturbative non-bps states and certain non-perturbative non-
bps d-brane states of the dual type i theory is exhibited. the relevant branes include a
zz2 charged non-bps d-string, and a bound state of such a d-string with a fundamental
string. the domains of stability of these states as well as their decay products in both
theories are determined and shown to agree with the duality map.

1 introduction

over the past couple of years stable non-bps states and d-branes have opened a new direction
to our understanding of string theory. reviews of these developments can be found in [1, 2, 3].
two approaches have been used to construct and analyse non-bps d-branes.
in the rst
approach [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] non-bps d-branes are constructed by tachyon condensation as bound
states of brane-anti-brane pairs. this construction permits for a classication of d-brane
charges in terms of k-theory [9]. the second approach uses the boundary state formalism [10,
11, 12, 13, 14], to describe d-branes as coherent states in the closed string theory satisfying
a number of consistency conditions [15, 16, 17, 18]. since this latter approach provides an
explicit boundary conformal eld theory description of non-bps d-branes, we use this second
approach.

so(32) heterotic string theory is conjectured to be non-perturbatively dual to type i string
theory in ten dimensions [19]. it should therefore be possible to identify suitable perturbative
non-bps states of the heterotic string with non-bps d-brane states in the type i theory.
the most familiar example of stable non-bps states are the states transforming in the spinor
representation of the gauge group of the so(32) heterotic string theory. they arise in the rst
excited level and are absolutely stable due to charge conservation but are not bps as n = 1
supersymmetry algebra has no central charges. the dual state in the type i theory is a stable
zz2-valued non-bps d-particle [7, 9], which can be described as a tachyonic kink solution on
the d1-d1 pair [5].

in this paper we test the s-duality between the heterotic string theory on s1 with gauge
group so(16)  so(16) and the type i theory on s1 with the same gauge group. in such a
conguration the two heterotic theories are t-dual to each other [20, 21]. the type i theory
is an orientifold of type iia by i9, where i9 reverses the sign of x9 and  is the world-sheet
parity operator. this orientifold can be thought of as two o8-planes [22] at x9 = 0 and
x9 = r9, which in the so(16)  so(16) point in moduli space has eight d8-branes, and
their images placed on each of the o8-planes to cancel the tadpole locally.1 the positions of
the d8-branes on the interval correspond in the t-dual type i theory to a wilson line.

the conserved charges of the type i string theory are kaluza-klein (kk) momentum and
d-string winding number, and those of type i are winding and d-particle numbers. the
duality map relating various parameters between type i and heterotic theory is given by [24]

rh =

(1.1)

where gm n is the nine-dimensional metric (m, n = 0, . . . , 8), h and i  are the heterotic and
type i coupling constants, and rh and ri  are the radii of the circle when measured in the

heterotic and type i metric, respectively. from this relations one can see that the heterotic
kk momentum is mapped to type i winding, and heterotic winding is mapped to the type i
d-particle number.

under the unbroken so(16) so(16) gauge group the states in the spinor conjugacy class
of so(32) representations decompose into two sets of bi-spinors, denoted a and b. in the
type i theory, a are shown to correspond to a zz2-valued non-bps d-string stretching along
the interval which is t-dual to the zz2-valued d-particle on s1 in type i theory. we show that
these bi-spinors are unstable against a decay into two single spinor states for radii less than a
critical radius rh. in the type i theory, this corresponds to the appearance of a tachyon in
the open string spectrum with endpoints on the zz2-valued d-string. for radii greater than
a certain critical radius ri , the d-string decays into a d0-brane at one o8-plane and an
anti-d0-brane on the other o8-plane. the zz2 charge of the decaying d-string is encoded in
the zz2 choice of locations for the decay products. we determine the masses of the various
states and show that at the critical radius they are equal to one another, indicating that the
deformation is marginal. further we show that the critical radii rh and ri  agree with (1.1)
qualitatively. this provides a test of the type i-heterotic duality beyond the constraints of
bps states.

the second class of bi-spinors b can be thought of as bound states of the a bi-spinors
and certain bi-vectors. in type i the b bi-spinors correspond to a bound state of a zz2-valued
non-bps d-string and f-string both stretching along the interval. we show that such a bound
state does indeed exist in type i. although the b bi-spinor (the (f,d) bound state) is stable
against decay into an a bi-spinor (the non-bps d-string) and the bi-vector (the fundamental
string) as we will see, it is not always stable against decay into the two dierent single spinor
states (a d0-d0 pair) and a bi-vector (a fundamental string stretching along x9). the mass
of the bound state and domains of stability of the heterotic and type i states are computed.
the regimes of stability in the two theories are shown to be qualitatively the same. in the
t-dual picture, the (f,d) bound state corresponds to a zz2-valued d-particle with a constant
velocity along s1 as the eect of adding a fundamental string to the d-string of type i is
to give the type i d-particle a kk momentum. we show that, unlike in the previous case,
presently the non-bps mass of the (f,d) bound state does not match with its decay product
at the critical radius. this indicates that the transition from the non-bps bound state to the
d-particle pair and a f-string is not a marginal deformation.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we briey review the heterotic string on s1
and point out that there are two kind of non-bps bi-spinors arising from the unbroken gauge
group so(16)  so(16). the duality map (1.1) is tested by comparing the masses of certain
bps states, namely bulk d-particle and fractional d-particle and anti-d-particle, in section
3. in section 4 the non-bps bi-spinor states are analysed. in section 5 we give the type i

3

analysis following boundary state approach. we conclude and raise some open problems in
section 6.

2 review of heterotic string on s1

given by [21]2

(2.1)

where v is an element of the internal 16 lattice, rh and ph are the compactication radius
and physical momentum, respectively, while wh  zz is the winding number respectively. in
terms of the background gauge eld, a (or wilson line) ph is given by

ph = nh  v  a  wha2/2 ,

(2.2)

where nh  zz denotes the kaluza-klein (kk) momentum. physical states satisfy the level
matching condition

p2
l + 2 (nl  1) = p2

r + 2 (nr  cr) ,

(2.3)

where nl and nr are left- and right-moving excitation numbers, and cr = 0 and 1/2 for the
right-moving fermions in the periodic (r) and anti-periodic (ns) sectors, respectively. for
bps states all the right moving oscillators should be in the ground state: nr = cr [27]. the
heterotic mass formula is given by

m2

h =

p2
r + (nr  cr) ,

which using the level-matching condition (2.3) becomes

m2

h = p2

r + 2 (nr  cr) .

(2.4)

(2.5)

the states with nl = 1 and v 2 = 0 are kk excitations of either the gravity multiplet or one of
the vector multiplets associated with the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group. but there are
additional massless states having nl = 0 and p2
l = 2. in the zero winding sector (wh = 0) we
have v 2 = 2 and ph = 0, hence states (v) are roots of so(32). for a non-trivial wilson line a,
these states correspond to the roots of the unbroken subgroup of so(32). without a wilson
line, the heterotic string has a r  1/r symmetry giving rise to an enhanced su(2) gauge
symmetry at the self-dual point. more generally, for a nontrivial wilson line, a, the winding

sectors give additional massless states at some critical radius. in this paper we consider only
the wilson line, a = (08, (1/2)8), which corresponds to an so(16) so(16) gauge group and
critical radius zero. in type i theory this is equivalent to placing eight d8-branes with mirrors
at each o8-plane giving rise to a constant dilaton and metric background in the bulk [24, 28].
the 2n1-dimensional spinor representation is the smallest representation of the ten di-
in nine dimensions, under the wilson line

mensional spinor conjugacy class of so(32).
a = (08; ( 1

(2.7)

in later sections we will show that in type i theory, the rst set of bi-spinors corresponds
to a zz2-charged non-bps d-string stretching along the interval with end-points at the two
o8-planes. the second set corresponds to a bound state of the zz2-charged non-bps d-string
with an f-string, both stretching along the interval.

3 single spinor states

in this section we describe heterotic single spinor states that are charged under one of the
so(16)s. in type i, they turn out to be fractional d-particles (or d0f ) stuck on an o8-plane.
their masses and bulk rr charges are half of those of the bulk d-particles.

a bulk d-particle is dual to a heterotic string with non-trivial winding, wh = 2 and the
physical momentum, ph = 0 . as v + awh = 0 with v = (08; (1)8), these states are not
charged under either of the so(16)s. the level-matching condition implies that nr = cr and
nl = 1. hence these are bps states and are kk excitations of either the gravity multiplet or
the vector multiplets in the cartan subalgebra. the heterotic mass formula gives

using (1.1) the corresponding type i bulk d-particle mass turns out to be

mh (d0bulk) = rh .

mi  (d0bulk) = 1/2

where v1 is of the form v + awh, with v = (( 1
2)8)  16, with an even number of +
signs, wh = 1 and vanishing physical momentum: ph = 0 (for kk momentum, nh = 1). the
type i d-particle number, is given by [28] ni  = wh/2 = 1/2. the level-matching condition
gives nl = 0 and nr = cr, thus v1 is a bps state whose mass is

using the duality relations (1.1), the type i mass is

mh (v1) =

mi  (v1) =

(3.4)

(3.5)

which is half of the d-particles mass. this shows that v1 corresponds to a fractional d-particle
stuck on the x9 = 0 o8-plane.

similarly v2 is of the form v + awh where v = (08; 12n, 082n)  16 with wh = 1, and
n = 0, . . . , 4. the level-matching condition implies that the state is bps (nr = cr), with
vanishing physical momentum, ph = 0 (i.e. kk momentum, nh = n  1). the mass formula
gives

mh (v2) =

rh
2

,

which in type i units is

mi  (v2) =

1
2i 

.

(3.6)

(3.7)

this shows that v2 corresponds to a fractional anti-d-particle stuck at the x9 = r9 o8-plane.

4 bi-spinor states

in this section we discuss in some detail the bi-spinors a and b. in particular we demonstrate
that they are non-bps states, which are stable in certain regions of the moduli space.

4.1 bi-spinors in a
the lightest states in a come from the zero winding sector. since a v  zz we choose ph = 0.
for nl = 0 the level matching condition implies that the states are non-bps: nr = 1 + cr.

6

the mass of the states with trivial winding, vanishing momentum, nl = 0 and nr = 1 + cr
is

mh (v  (128, 128)) = 2 .

(4.1)

(4.2)

note that there could be bps states satisfying nr = cr with wh = 1, ph = 0. but for such
winding numbers the modied lattice vector (v + awh), does not belong to 16.

the bi-spinors a are charged under both the so(16)s. in fact these non-bps states have
the same charges as v1 and v2, the single spinor states discussed in section 3. this suggests
that a decay process into the bps single spinor states is possible. since the mass of the single
spinor states is radius dependent the decay too will depend on the radius. as the mass of the
single spinor states is rh/2, the bi-spinor states a decay into the single spinor states v1 and
v2 for

rh < 2 .

in the following section we construct a d-brane state which corresponds to a. this turns
out to be a zz2 d-string stretching along the interval. this d-string is the t-dual of the zz2
d-particle of type i.

4.2 bi-spinors in b
the states, v   (128, 128) (i.e. in sector b) have an odd number of + 1
2s in both the rst
and second eight entries. hence they can be expressed as sum of a state, v  (128, 128) (i.e.
in sector a) and a bi-vector state, vbv  (16, 16):



(4.3)
in type i the state  (1, 07;1, 07) corresponds to a fundamental string stretching along the
interval. the overall sign corresponds to the orientation of the string.

the lightest states in b are those with wh = 0. as a v  zz + 1/2, these have ph = 1/2.
for nl = 0 the level matching condition implies that the states are non-bps: nr = 1 + cr.
here 2n + 1 (n = 0, . . . , 3) is the number of + 1
2s in the last eight entries of v  (128, 128).
the mass formula for such states is

mh (v   (128, 128)) =   1

4r2
h

+ 2!1/2

.

(4.4)

on the other hand, the bi-vector states, vbv with wh = 0, nl = 0 are bps (nr = cr). the

7

mass of these bps states with physical momentum, ph = 1/2 (as a  v = 1/2) is given by
(4.5)

1

mh (vbv  (16, 16)) =

2rh

since m2

h (v  (128, 128)) = 2, we have

mh (v   (128, 128)) < mh (v  (128, 128)) + mh (vbv  (16, 16)) ,

(4.6)

for a nite radius. hence the states in b are bound states of states in a and the bi-vector
states (4.3). although the bi-spinor, b is stable against a decay into the bi-spinor a and a
bi-vector state, it is not always stable against decay into the single spinor states, v1 and v2,
and a bi-vector state. in particular this bi-vector is unstable for

rh < 1 .

(4.7)

in the next section we show that in type i theory the bi-spinor b corresponds to a bound state
of a non-bps zz2 d-string with an f-string, both stretching along the interval. equivalently,
the states in b describe a non-bps d-string with a constant electric eld on its world-sheet
[26]. this zz2 d-string with constant electric eld becomes under t-duality, a zz2 d-particle
with constant velocity along s1 [37, 38].

5 type i analysis

the states in b describe a non-bps d-string with a constant electric eld on its world-sheet.
such a bound state will exist as long as the constant electric eld on a zz2 d-string is invariant
under i9. if the gauge eld is invariant under i9 the (f,d) bound state can be stabilised
from an unstable non-bps d-string with constant electric ux in type iia by orientifolding.
the nsns b eld equation of motion has f = f +b as a source term [12, 26, 13, 33, 14] where
f = da is the gauge eld strength. recall that in type i, the gauge eld vertex operator has
tangential derivatives of the form dx i/d which are odd under , while the transverse scalars
have normal derivatives. as a result the gauge eld is projected out while the transverse
scalars survive.3 in type i theory, on the other hand, the projection is i9. as a result the
gauge eld component along s1 survives the projection. similarily, while the nsns two form
b is odd under  and hence projected out in type i, b9 is also odd under i9 and thus survives
the projection. this guarantees the gauge invariance of the bound state.

as with most non-bps congurations [1, 31, 18], the stability of the zz2 d-string, and
its bound state with a fundamental string, depends crucially on the size of the compact

3in fact a zz2 subgroup of the original u(1) survives. this describes the gso projection on the current

algebra fermions in the heterotic string in the type i-heterotic duality context [24].

directions. we investigate this dependence by constructing boundary states which describe
the congurations studied presently. in particular we obtain the critical radius at which the
congurations become unstable and compute the tensions of these states.

the boundary state representing a zz2 d-string is given by

|b1zz2i = n

2

(|b1, +insns  |b1,insns) ,

(5.1)

where n is the normalisation obtained by factorising on an open string partition function (see
for example [18] for more details on obtaining such normalisations) and

(5.2)

here w9 is the winding number,  = 1,  is a wilson line and for compactness of notation
we do not write  on the left-hand side of the above equation. the matrix s encodes the
boundary conditions of the d-string and is a 10  10 diagonal matrix given by

s = diag(1, 1, . . . , 1,1) .

(5.3)

the d-string is taken to lie along directions x0 and x9 with x9 compactied along a circle of
radius ri , and we work in the minkowski metric. as the zz2 d-string stretches in directions
0 and 9 while the o8-planes extend in directions 0, . . . , 8 it is not possible to work in the
light-cone gauge and ghost and superghost contributions will have to be taken into account.
these are taken as in [12, 10, 32]. the ground state |b1, k, w9, i(0) carries momentum k in the
directions transverse to the d-string and is unique in the nsns sector. to obtain a localised
d-brane, we have to fourier transform the above state,

8

|bp, y, i =z 
y=1


dkeiky
xw9

eiw9|bp, k, w9, i .

(5.4)

here y denotes the location of the boundary state along the transverse directions, and is
suppressed throughout as we take it to be y = 0. the normalisation n is equal to that of
a type iib d-string from which it follows that the tension of the zz2 d-string is the same as
that of a conventional type ii d-string. this is a 2 bigger than the tension of a type i bps
d-string. this follows since the open string partition function for the zz2 d-string has no gso
projection but does have the orientifold projection (1 + i9)/2.

next consider the strings that end on a d8-brane. the boundary state of a d8-brane is

|b8insns = n8

(|b8, +insns  |b8,insns)

9

|b8irr =

(|b8, +irr + |b8,irr)

4in8
2

|b8i = |b8insns + |b8irr .

(5.5)

explicitly the nsns boundary state is as in equation (5.2) but now the matrix s has eight
entries equal to 1, with only the rst and last one equal to 1. the rr sector is not discussed
here as it does not enter into our analysis. factorisation of the cylinder diagram on an annulus
xes the normalisation n8. strings that stretch between a d8-brane and the zz2 d-string have
9 nd and one nn boundary conditions. as a result the ground state energy in the ns sector
is positive, while as always in the r sector it is zero, thus these are tachyon free.

next we consider the mobius strip diagrams corresponding, in the closed string channel
to the exchange between the d-string and the o8-planes. a crosscap state representing an
o8-plane is given by a coherent state very similar to that of a d8-brane, the only dierence
being an extra factor of (1)n in the coherent state exponentials [11, 10]. to check that there
are no open string tachyons in the theory we compute the open string partition functions.
since strings stretching between the d-string and the d8-brane have no tachyons we disregard
these in the following. the relevant amplitude in the closed string channel is given by

it then follows that for ri   2, the zz2 d-string is tachyon free and hence stable.

in
equation (5.6) we have xed the normalisation constants by requiring that the cylinder and
mobius strip diagrams factorise on suitable open string partition functions. the decay of the
non-bps d-string into a d0-d0 pair restricted to the orientifold planes is possible in the region

ri  > 2 .

(5.9)

this is also conrmed by the fact that, in this region, the classical mass of the d-string, given
below, is bigger than that of two fractional d-particles, given by (3.5) and (3.7), in the above
region

(5.10)
the numerical factor above follows by noting that the tension of the zz2 d-string is 2 bigger
than the tension of a type i bps d-string. as expected, the corresponding masses in the
two theories are not related by the duality map, since for non-bps states the masses are not
protected from quantum corrections. in terms of heterotic string theory the decay corresponds
to (3.3). the regimes of stability of the non-bps state in the two dual theories, (4.2) and (5.9),
are qualitatively the same, given the duality relation (1.1).

consider next a bound state of the zz2 d-string with a fundamental string. we show
that the tension of this state is lower than the individual tenions of the d- and f-strings,
thus forming a bound state. further we will analyse the stability of this state and nd a
dependence on the radius. boundary states with gauge elds were rst considered in [12] and
in the context of d-branes in [13, 33, 14, 32]. in the nsns sector the following changes occur
in the boundary state description. the matrix s now becomes

(5.12)

we have placed the x0 and x9 coordinates in positions 1,2 in the matrix. in the above f is
given by [32]

,

(5.13)

where m = 1, is the number of fundamental strings, and n = 1 is the number of d-strings. the
background gauge eld has no eect on ghost or superghost contributions. in the presence of
a gauge eld the open string momentum eigenvalues on a circle become [34]

pn =

.

(5.14)

the non-compact open string momentum integrals get modied in an analogous fashion. this
can be viewed from the closed string channel as an extra normalisation factor

qdet( + f ) =q1  f 2 ,

(5.15)

of the boundary state corresponding to the non-bps bound state relative to the zz2 d-
string [12]. we are now in a position to compute the amplitude corresponding to a1 for
the (f,d) bound state. since s is an orthogonal matrix, the non-zero mode contributions
to the cylinder amplitude are as before. further, the non-zero modes of the mobius strip
amplitude do not change either as shown in the appendix. the amplitude is

(5.18)

again the regimes of stability of the non-bps state in the two dual theories, (4.7) and (5.18),
are qualitatively the same, given the duality relation (1.1). the tension of a general cong-
uration of m f-string and n d-string bound state is (m2 + n2)1/2 times the d-string tension

12

[32]. non-threshold bound states are realised if m and n are relatively prime integers. in our
case the non-bps d-string mass is given by (5.10). hence the mass of the non-bps d-string
with one unit of electric eld (with m = n = 1) is given by

mi (d1nonbps + f ) =

ri 
i 

.

(5.19)

unlike the case of the non-bps d-string, the mass of the non-bps (f,d) bound state is
not same as its decay products (namely the d0-d0 pair with (8,8) f-string) at the critical
radius (5.18). here the f-string mass is ri /2 obtained from (4.5) using duality map (1.1).
there is a loss of energy due to the interaction between the decay products in the presence of
an electric eld. the transition from the non-bps bound state to the d-particle pair and a
fundamental string at the critical radius does not turn out to be a marginal deformation.

6 type i analysis

in this section we briey outline what happens under t-duality to the analysis of the previous
section. as expected t-duality remains valid when analysing non-bps states. under t-duality
the zz2 d-string becomes a zz2 d-particle analysed in [7, 36]. the combined cylinder and
mobius strip diagram amplitude (5.6) undergoes only one change; the open string momentum

sum pm e2t(m/ri  )2 now becomes a winding sum pw e2t(wri )2, thus stabilising the d-particle

for

ri >

,

(6.1)

1
2

in agreement with [7, 36]. under t-duality an electric eld becomes a velocity, and so the zz2
d-string with electric ux is dual to a d-particle with constant velocity in the compactied
direction. the open string momentum sum in (5.16) now becomes a winding sum

e2t(wri1f 2)2

.

xw

(6.2)

the f dependent square-root is easily identied as a lorentz contraction of the compactica-
tion radius as viewed by the moving zz2 d-particle. this moving d-particle is stable for

ri >

1
2

,

(6.3)

a radius smaller than that of the static d-particle, which can be regarded as a consequence of
special relativity.

7 final remarks and conclusion

let (p, q) denotes a bound state of p f-strings and q d-strings with p, q any relatively prime
pair in type iib string theory. existence of this bound state is a consequence of conjectured
sl(2, zz) duality symmetry of the type iib string theory [35]. the (p, 1) bound states exists
as a consequence of the d-string structure [26]. but the situation is dierent in our case with
zz2-charged non-bps d-string due to the following observation. from equation (4.3), we see
that if we add even number of bi-vector states to any bi-spinor in a we get a bi-spinor in a
itself. in type i theory, this observation corresponds to the fact that (p, 1) bound states exist
only for p = 1. for p odd, the bound state decays into a p = 1 bound state and a number of
winding states. on the other hand, if we add two (8,8) f-strings to the non-bps d-string the
system is unstable against decay into the d-string itself and (probably) a full winding state
or a closed string state. as far as charge conservation is concerned this is equivalent to the
fact that two such d-strings together are unstable and decay into massless states. the fact
that two d-strings in our example are not stable is not surprising as two spinor states can
annihilate to give various massless states. for example, if we take two bi-spinor states of the
form (( 1
2)8) they together carry the same charge and same mass (at all radii) as the state
(116) which can decay into various massless states in the adjoint representation describing
(8,8) f-strings with both the d8-branes on the same orientifold planes.

2)8; ( 1

since the mass of a state with unit winding is ri , in the case of the d-string with two

units of electric eld, using (5.19), the inequality

mi (d-string + 2f ) > mi (d-string) + mi (winding state) ,

(7.4)

holds for suciently small i  at all radius. hence, for a suciently small type i coupling,
the d-string with two units of electric eld is unstable against a decay into a d-string and a
closed string state. since the conguration studied is non-bps, it is not surprising that the
above inequality only holds for small type i coupling.

in this paper we have tested the duality between the heterotic and type i string with
so(16)  so(16) gauge group beyond the bps limit. we have found agreement between the
regions of stability and decay products of non-bps states in both theories. in particular we
have found that the domains of stability are qualitativety related by the duality map between
the two theories. this fact was not guaranteed a priori as the masses of non-bps states are not
protected by supersymmetry. unlike the case of non-bps d-string the mass of the non-bps
(f,d) bound state is not the same as its decay product at the critical radius. this indicates
that the transition from the non-bps bound state to the d-particle pair and a fundamental
string is not a marginal deformation.

it would be interesting to perform a similar analysis for other wilson lines, where th gauge

14

group is so(16  2n)  so(16 + 2n). this is achieved by moving n d8-branes from one
o8-plane to the other and to see whether there is any possible modication in string creation
and gauge enhancement phenomena in the presence of these non-bps d-branes.

a mobius strip diagram

in this appendix, we explicitly derive the mobius strip part of equation (5.16). the term we
are then interested in is

m = hc8|elhc|b1zz2, fi .

(a.1)

the contributions from the ghosts, superghosts and directions transverse to the zz2 d-string
are as in the case of f = 0. we focus here on the matter contributions in the directions x0
and x9. we write

this demonstrates that the bosonic non-zero modes contribute the same factor to the mobius
