abstract

without a gauge xing, canonical variables for the light-front su(2) gluodynamics are deter-
mined. the gauss law is written in terms of the canonical variables. the system is qualied
as a generalized dynamical system with rst class constraints. abeliazation is a specic
feature of the formulation (most of the canonical variables transform nontrivially only under
the action of an abelian subgroup of the gauge transformations). at nite volume, a dis-
crete spectrum of the light-front hamiltonian p+ is obtained in the sector of vanishing p.
we obtain, therefore, a quantized form of the classical solutions previously known as non-
abelian plane waves. then, considering the innite volume limit, we nd that the presence
of the mass gap depends on the way the innite volume limit is taken, which may suggest
the presence of dierent phases of the innite volume theory.

1 introduction

the light-front formulation of relativistic dynamics has been widely discussed since the work
of dirac [1]. its virtue is the presence of a kinematic semi-positive observable, the momentum
component p. it generates shifts along the longitudinal direction x = (x0  x3)/2 at a
xed light-front time x+ = (x0 + x3)/2. as such, it should be quadratic in the canonical
variables even in the presence of an interaction (such variables are called kinematic). for
a system with no tachyons (p 2 = pp+  p 2
  0, p0  0), p is semi-positive, and the
subspace annihilated by p contains the translation invariant vacuum state. in addition, for
a system with no massless states (i.e. having a mass gap), the above subspace contains only
the states of vanishing four-momentum. therefore, in the light-front formulation, nding
the vacuum state and the fock space of such a system are kinematic problems.

the light-front formulation also induces a specic kind of intuition believed to be valu-
able in many physical situations (for a review, see refs.
[2]). for example, the light-front
formulation turns out to be closely related to the innite momentum frame limit [3], and to
the notion of constituent quarks [4]. we also note that the light-front formulation in a nite
volume appears in discussions of recent developments of m-theory [5].

thus, the light-front formulation of gauge theories and, in particular, of gluodynamics,
is a worthwhile goal. however, up to the moment, the light-front formulation of the gauge
theories is less well developed, in our opinion, than the conventional equal-time formulation.
the reason for the above assertion is that, to overcome technical diculties, the light-front
formulation has been conned to xed gauges (almost always, to the light-cone gauge [6, 7],
or to other gauges [8, 9]). on the other hand, a general formulation of a gauge theory (see,
e.g., ref. [10]) may better start with a determination of the canonical variables prior to any
gauge xing. in the case of the equal-time formulation of the gauge theories, the canonical
variables are e and a. with this accomplished, one is to nd the constraints and calculate
the algebra of the poisson brackets involving the constraints and the hamiltonian. after that,
the system is qualied as a generalized dynamical system with rst class constraints (the
case of the equal-time formulation of the gauge theories), and a well-developed machinery
to treat such a system, in particular, by xing a gauge and introducing the faddeevpopov
ghosts, becomes available.

in this paper, we determine the canonical variables of the light-front su(2) gluodynamics
without a gauge xing. the light-front version of the gauss law is also determined, and the
system is qualied as a generalized dynamical system with rst class constraints. thus,
the light-front formulation of a gauge theory is established on a par with the conventional
equal-time formulation.

a specic feature of the formulation obtained is that it has a form of an abelian gauge
theory, because most of the canonical variables transform nontrivially only under the action
of the abelian subgroup of the gauge transformations which leaves the component a of
the gauge eld invariant. thus, we obtain a version of the abelian projection [11] without
a gauge xing.

we also consider a gauge invariant reduction of the dynamics to the congurations of

2

zero p. to this end, we diagonalize p, i.e., identify the excitations carrying the nonzero
quanta of the longitudinal momentum. then, the reduction is obtained by nullifying the
canonical variables corresponding to these quanta. if there is a mass gap in gluodynamics,
and the light-front formulation is correct (i.e., equivalent to the equal-time formulation),
we expect the light-front hamiltonian p+ to be vanishing on the equations of motion of this
reduced dynamics. while the reduced dynamics is indeed much simpler than the complete
one, the vanishing of p+ is not evident.

this brings up another important issue, namely, the dependence of the formulation on
the infrared regularization. to determine the canonical variables, we need to introduce a
gauge invariant infrared cuto. in this paper, we use a compactication on a torus imposing
periodic boundary conditions on the gauge elds along the x direction. then, it turns out
that the reduced p+ does vanish on eld congurations decaying fast enough at the innity
of the transverse plane, and is nontrivial on the congurations of nonzero asymptotics at the
transverse innity. not surprisingly, in the latter case, the above reduced dynamics turns
out to be a dynamics of the zero modes [12], i.e., of the elds with an imposed dependence
on the longitudinal and transverse space coordinates. the classical solutions of the gauge
eld equations obtained in the framework of the reduced dynamics coincide up to a gauge
with the previously known non-abelian plane wave solutions due to coleman [13]. the
invariance of the quantum theory with respect to certain large gauge transformations gives
a quantization condition for these non-abelian plane waves. therefore, the spectrum of p+
on the subspace of vanishing p turns out in this case to be discrete, bounded from below,
and the quantum of the spectrum is proportional to (g2l)/v, where v is the volume
of the compactied transverse plane, g is the gauge coupling, and l is the length of the
compactied direction x. note that this scaling of the quantum of the light-front energy
holds for any nonzero number of the transverse dimensions, and the presence of the coupling
makes the dimension correct.

we conclude that there is no mass gap in the nite volume light-front gluodynamics. on
the other hand, the spectrum of the light-front gluodynamics at innite volume is qualita-
tively dependent on the way the innite volume limit is taken. if l is taken to innity rst,
the mass gap can be generated. if v is taken to innity before l, the resulting theory, if it
exists, has no mass gap. therefore, this can indicate that the nite volume theory contains
markers (v and l) for dierent phases of the innite volume theory.

the rest of the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we dene the canonical
variables for su(2) gluodynamics without a gauge xing, using faddeev-jackiw approach to
constrained systems [14]. then, in section 3, we present the light-front gauss law, which,
in analogy with the equal-time fromulation, generate the local gauge transformations of the
canonical variables. in section 4, we write the equation for the zero modes which is necessary
to determine the light-front hamiltonian. in section 5, we show that the reduced dynamics
at p = 0 leads to non-abelian plane waves solutions, and we nd their quantum spectrum.
section 6 contains discussion and conclusion.

we start with the action of the su(2) gluodynamics:

our aim is to give a canonical formulation of the system (1) with x+ as time. to this end,
we will make a chain of transformations of the eld variables. every transformation will be
one-to-one, or will introduce new auxiliary variables expressible via the initial variables. at
each step, we will keep track of the form that the terms of the action with the time derivatives

assume. ultimately we will obtain the canonical form, pi pi qi (the overdot denotes the time
derivative), for these terms, and will recognize pi and qi as canonically conjugated variables.
this way of treatment is in the spirit of the faddeevjackiw approach to constrained systems
[14].

k, where (d)a = a + gabcab

what complicates this program is the way the time derivatives of aa

k enter the action
(1): (dak)a aa
c is the covariant derivative in the x
direction. a simplication of this term is the reason to conne the formulation to the light-
cone gauge [6, 7]. this approach is not available for us, as we explained above. instead,
to simplify this term, we suggest a transformation to new variables for aa
k. we will denote
k and the new variables aa
them aa
k
taken at the same moment of time is one-to-one and depends on the conguration of aa
 at
the same moment of time.

k. the correspondence between the initial variables aa

another ingredient of treating the term with the time derivatives of aa

k is taken in concord
with [6, 7]. that is, we compactify the theory along the x direction. namely, all the elds
(x = l/2). in this case, the
are considered to be periodic in x: aa
spectrum of d is discrete, and it becomes evident that the components of aa
k nullied
by d are non-dynamical. one may neglect this subtlety at the expense of appearance of
infrared divergences in the formulation.

(x = l/2) = aa

to begin our chain of variable transformations, we start with the less problematic terms
with the time derivative of aa
. the rst term in the square brackets of eq. (1) contains
a square of the time derivative of aa
. in the case of the equal-time formulation, the time
derivatives of all space components of the gauge eld enter the action in this way. in the
case under consideration, we will treat the time derivatives of the component a in analogy
with the equal-time formulation [10]. namely, to get an action linear in time derivatives, we
substitute the action (1) by an equivalent action:

where e a is considered as an independent variable. to see the equivalence, take the variation
with respect to e a and substitute back in (2) its extremal value f a
+. now eq. (2) is linear

in the time derivatives, and the content of the round bracket gives the light-front energy
yielded by the noether procedure: p+ = r dxdx(f a

in what follows, we will treat  as a known functional of aa

 and  (recall that aa

to express aa

+ in terms of aa

, we need to introduce special bases in the space of eld
congurations. the connection will be found between the coecients of the expansions of
the tilded and untilded elds over the tilded and untilded bases. these expansions are an
important ingredient of our approach.

from now on, we switch over from the components with color indices to matrices: a =
a/2, a are the pauli matrices. we will consider two sets of bases in the space of eld
aa
congurations, p and p, where p is an index described below, and every p, p is a traceless
matrix eld depending on the space-time coordinates.

the bases are complete and orthonormal, hp|pi = pp, h p| pi = pp, with respect to

the following scalar product in the space of matrix elds:

h|i = z dx 2 tr .

(4)

therefore, any eld is expressible as a sum over the bases: a = pp php|ai, a =

5

pp ph p| ai. for the components of the elds with respect to the bases, we will use the
notation ap
 = hp|ai. the elds will be expanded only over the corresponding bases: tilded
over tilded basis, unilded over untilded. note that the expansion coecients are independent
of x.

p  d/i, respectively:

the bases p and p are the bases of eigenfunctions of the operators p  d/i and
(5)
note that both p and p are hermitian with the scalar product (4). intuitively, the eigenvalues
p correspond to the values of the quanta of the longitudinal momentum p. it is easy to
understand that they are gauge invariant. thus, there is no tilde over the eigenvalue p in the
second of the eqs. (5). we also indiscriminately interchange the label on the eigenfunction
and the eigenvalue.

pp = pp, p p = p p.

now we give an explicit form of p. recalling the denitions aa

 = 3a and d =

  ig[ a, ], it is easy to see that the eigenvalues of p are
+ g,  = 1, 0, +1,

2n
l

p(n, ) =

(6)

where n is a number of the fourier mode, and  is an index to label the splitting of the level
due to the presence of the gauge eld. and the corresponding eigenfunctions are

p(n,0) =

exp(i 2n
l x)3
2l

, p(n,) =

exp(i 2n

l x)(1  i2)
22l

.

(7)

now, we give a representation for p. if u is the unitary matrix of the gauge transfor-

mation from a to a, a = u( a  /(ig))u , it is easy to check that

p = u pu .

(8)

in words: the eigenfunctions are transformed uniformly under the gauge transformations.
the crucial dierence between the tilded and untilded bases is that the one corresponding
to the light-cone gauge is independent of the time and transverse space coordinates. we will
exploit this property of the tilded basis in what follows.

+ in terms of ap

now we are ready to express ap

. to this end, consider a gauge invariant
object hp|f+i at nonzero p (it is gauge invariant, because both p and f+ are transformed
uniformly and the scalar product involves the trace). calculated in the light-cone gauge, it
+ (to see this, note that h p| ai is vanishing at nonzero p). while in terms of the

initial variables, it is ipap

. thus, we have

ap

(9)

these expressions are summarized as follows: a+ is linear in a+ and a. this observation
helps to keep track of the terms of the action involving the time derivatives of a.

to express the zero mode of a+, h 0| a+i  a0
+,
in terms of a, we consider an-
other gauge invariant object, hp|d+pi, for an eigenvector p with nonzero commutator
[p, 
p] = (p)0. the function (p) above is gauge invariant and easy to calculate using (7).
calculated in the light-cone gauge, hp|d+pi = ig(p) a0
+, while in the initial variables it
is (p)(h 0|u +ui  iga0

+). to obtain the last expression, eq. (8) was used. thus,

a0

+ = a0

(10)

now we go back to the term h fk| f+ki of the action (2). using eq. (9), the represen-
tations fk = d ak  k a, f+k = ak  dk a+, and the completeness of the base p, we

derive

z dx+dxh fk| f+ki = z dx+dxhh d ak| aki  hk ak| ai
dk fk| pihp|f+i + ( dk fk)0 a0
+i.

(11)

the second term in the rhs of eq. (11) comes from the product hk a| aki, and is obtained

via integration by parts. the rhs is linear in f+. the coecient by f+ will give a
contribution to e, the canonical variable conjugated to a. another contribution to e will
come from the term hk ak| ai of eq. (11) because a is linear in a. to express a in
a, we use eq. (6) and the denition a = l 0, and express the time derivative

terms of
in terms of the gauge invariant p:

a =

the time derivative of the gauge invariant eigenvalue can be calculated as a time derivative
of an expectation value over the untilded eigenvector of the untilded operator p:

where we have taken into account that [p(n,), p(n,+)] = 0/l.

in the above eq. (14), e and a are the canonically conjugated variables, the content of the
round brackets is the hamiltonian, and the last line contains the lagrange multiplier a+.
eq. (15) is to be used to express e of the hamiltonian in terms of the canonical variables.
the last step in the variable change is to reveal the canonical variables connected with
ak. using the completeness of the basis p, we rewrite the relevant term: h d ak| aki =
ipp6=0 p( ap
k, where the dagger means complex conjugation. note that the independence
on the tilded basis of the time was crucial: we substituted the projections of the time
derivative ak on the basis vectors by the time derivatives of the projections. notice now
that a(p) = (ap) for any hermitian eld a. this observation makes evident that

(18)

notice that the lhs of eq. (16) expressed with eq. (17) in terms of the canonical variables
could contain the time derivatives of p, but these terms are cancelled against each other.

an important explanation is in order: eq. (16) contains the inequality p > 0. it may
seem that the fulllment of this inequality depends on the conguration of a. this though
is not the case, because we can treat the g of eq. (6) as the splitting of the levels of p. as
such, it is constrained by the inequality

0   


gl

.

(19)

in fact, the whole construction can be reformulated without use of the transformation to
the light-cone gauge. in this reformulation, g is dened as the minimal splitting between
the levels of p, and p are dened as the eigenfunctions of p. after this explanation, we can
label the canonical variables ap
k of eq. (17) by n > 0 and the discrete variable  = 1, 0, +1
related to p: p = 2n/l+ g. there are also degrees of freedom ap
k corresponding to n = 0,
p = g. we will stick in what follows to the more compact labeling by the eigenvalue p > 0.

the crucial observation is that the zero mode bk enters only the hamiltonian in the
round bracket of eq. (14), and not the terms involving the lagrange multiplier a+. the
variation with respect to the latter gives the light-front version of the gauss law. it consists
of two components. the rst component comes from the variation of the rst term of the
second line of eq. (14), while the second component comes from the second term. note
that these terms can be varied independently, since the rst term contains only the nonzero
modes of a+, while the second term depends only on the zero mode a0
+. the variation of the
hamiltonian with respect to bk gives an equation linear in bk. solving it, one determines
bk in terms of the canonical variables.

3 the gauss law

next, we write down the components of the gauss law. the rst component is

de = 0,

and the second,

k = 0,

(21)

(22)

1 + 2

2, and (p) was previously introduced by the relation [p, 

where   2
p] = (p)0.
note that the rst component holds at any space-time point, while the second is independent
of x and holds at any point of the transverse plane at any moment of the light-front time.
also note that (p) = /l, where p = 2n/l + g.

k = f p

the natural next step is to calculate the poisson brackets between the canonical variables
and the components of the gauss law smeared with some weights. the expectation is
that the components of the gauss law will generate the local gauge transformations of the
canonical variables. a simple calculation supports this expectation. the rst component
of the gauss law (21) generates the gauge transformation of the canonical variables with
the local parameter  orthogonal to the zero mode, h0|i = 0. as the form of eq. (21)
shows, this transformation leaves ap
k invariant. that we already know from the denition
(17). to see this, notice that ap
k/(ip) at nonzero p. the second component of the
gauss law (22) generates the leftover abelian gauge transformations whose local parameters
are proportional to the zero mode,  = 0, where  is a (non-matrix) eld independent
of x. as the form of eq. (22) shows, the ap
k are transformed under these transformations
as charged elds under an abelian gauge transformation, and the charge is determined by
the sign . this can also be understood independently from the denition (17). to see
this, notice that the abelian transformations leave a invariant. if we take the basis p to
be completely determined by the conguration of a, the basis p is also invariant under
these transformations.
k transforms as a charged
eld under the abelian gauge transformations. we conclude that the components of the
light-front gauss law generate the gauge transformations, which is quite analogous to the
situation in the conventional equal time formulation.

it follows from this observation that f p

9

note how the zero mode component of the gauss law (22) acts on e: {r  a0

, e} =
0. this is again in accord with our expectations, because it corresponds to the invari-
ance of the zero mode of e = f+ under the abelian subgroup of the gauge transformations
(see eq. (15) for the connection between e and e). to understand it, assume that bk  a0
k
transforms as it should under the gauge transformation generated by 0. then, there is
a cancellation between the transformation of e and the transformation of bk in eq. (15)
which leaves the zero mode of e invariant as promised.
to nally check the assumption that the components of the gauss law generate the gauge
transformation of all the elds involved, we should nd bk in terms of the canonical variables
and check that the poisson brackets between them and the components of the gauss law
generate the gauge transformations of bk. we postpone this check to make the following
observations. as the components of the gauss law generate the gauge transformations of
the canonical variables, the poisson brackets of these components form a closed algebra and
commute with the hamiltonian, because the latter is gauge invariant. therefore, the light-
front gluodynamics is a generalized dynamical system with rst class constraints. this is the
main result of the paper. another observation is that the canonical light-front formulation
leads to a natural abeliazation of the theory. all the non-abelian transformations act
nontrivially only on a, leaving the rest of the dynamical variables invariant. an abelian
subgroup of the gauge transformations which leaves a invariant is naturally singled out.
the zero mode of the gauge eld plays the role of the abelian gauge eld in an abelian
gauge theory with the space-time dimension decreased by one (the x dimension is eaten
by the projection on the zero mode). this abelian gauge eld turns out to be nondynamical
and expressible in terms of the dynamical variables.

4 the zero mode equation

we now work out the equation for bk. to this end, we take a variation of the round bracket
of eq. (14) over ak, convolute it with 0, and require the convolution to vanish. it gives

where bk is set to zero in the rhs, and kl is the antisymmetric tensor with 12 = 1. this is
the equation to determine bk. first we note that it gives bk which transforms in the right
way under the gauge transformations of the rhs. second, to solve for bk, we need to invert
the operator acting on bk. it is a schrodinger operator with a positive potential. thus, it
may have a zero eigenvalue only at ap
k = 0. in this case, the potential vanishes, and the
equation does not restrict the contribution to bk which does not depend on x. though,
in this latter case, bk enters the hamiltonian only via its derivatives over the transverse
coordinates. thus, we conclude that eq. (23) suces to determine the hamiltonian of the
light-front gluodynamics.

5 the non-abelian plane waves reduction

now we turn to the analysis of the reduced dynamics by requiring p to vanish. to see the
restriction this requirement sets on the dynamical variables, consider p as it is yielded by
the noether procedure:

in terms of the canonical variables, it is

is necessary and sucient for vanishing of p. we note in passing that p is independent
of the canonical pair e, a. a enters p only indirectly via the zero mode component
of the gauss law (22). the latter restricts the possible congurations of ap
k. in particular,
integrating eq. (22) over the transverse plane we see that the total sum of the abelian
charges over the transverse plane should vanish all the time. this, in fact, implies that the
only ap
k which is allowed by the vanishing of p (p = g) is forbidden by the gauss law,
because it has denite abelian charge, and nothing can compensate it. thus, we conclude
that the reduction to the congurations of vanishing p is equivalent to the reduction to
vanishing ap

k, i.e., to the reduction from eq. (20) to ak = bk 0.

this reduction simplies the action (14) dramatically. the second term of the square
bracket vanishes, the round bracket is simplied because e becomes just e + 0kbk (see
eq. (15) and recall that bk  a0
k), f12 becomes (1b2  2b1) 0, and the last term of the
k a0
square bracket becomes (k a0
+). at no compactication over the x direction, in the
light-cone gauge a = 0, and at boundary conditions on e at the x innity suppressing
the zero mode e0, the classical equations of the reduced dynamics implied by this action
are  a+ = 0,  a+ = 0, ak = 0. this reduction of the classical gauge equations is known
since the work of coleman [13]. thus, we may say that the reduced dynamics of the paper
generalizes one of colemans non-abelian plane waves for the case of the compactied x.
our next aim is to see the hamiltonian formulation of the paper at work. we will nd the
quantum spectrum of the non-abelian plane waves.

to this end, we will work in the gauge da+ = 0, a0

+ = 0, which is the light-front
analog of the weyl gauge. in this gauge, the reduced system is a hamiltonian system with
the hamiltonian

hred(b) = z dx 1

and v  r dx is the volume of the transverse plane. apart from the hamiltonian (28),
the reduced system is dened by the gauss law de = 0,  a0

variables. one is e, another is a  r dx a0

let us demonstrate that the phase space of the reduced system is parameterized by two
/v. this is so because of all ep only e0
is nonzero by the component of the gauss law de = 0, and, under a gauge transforma-
tion, e0 can be shifted by the transverse laplacian of a gauge parameter eld (recall that
{r  a0
, e} = 0). thus, the only piece of e which is simultaneously gauge invari-
ant and allowed by the gauss law is e. the same holds with respect to a: the only gauge
invariant component of a is a0
, and it should be independent of the transverse coordinates
by the zero mode of the gauss law. the reduction to a single gauge invariant component is
achievable because a can be transformed to a0
 by a gauge transfromation, and the latter
is a gauge invariant expressible in terms of the gauge invariant trace of a wilson loop.

notice the specic duality between e and a: the gauss law forbids nonzero ep at
p 6= 0, while the gauge invariance admits only constant e0; for a, the gauss law and the
gauge invariance interchange their roles in the reduction, i.e., the gauge invariance forbids
nonzero ap
. in
this reasoning, we assumed that the theory is compactied also in the transverse directions
x1,2.

 at nonzero p, while the gauss law admits only constant contributions to a0

thus, we introduce two variables q  a, and p  v e. they suce to parameterize
the phase space of the reduced system, and the normalization is chosen to make them
canonically conjugated: {p, q} = 1. the hamiltonian (28) in terms of these variables is
hred = p 2/(2v). notice that v plays the role of the mass of a free nonrelativistic particle.
the next crucial point is that q, in fact, should be compactied.

less matrix   gx(/gl)0. the transformed gauge eld au

to see this, consider a large gauge transformation generated by the hermitian trace-
 = u(a  /(ig))u ,
u = exp(i), is periodic in x, if a is. thus, u is indeed a gauge transformation of the
compactied theory. notice that this is not the case for any  = , where  is noninte-
ger. because of this, the above transformation cannot be continuously transformed to the
trivial transformation. the presence of the large gauge transformations in a compactied
theory is known since the work [16]. in the context of the light-front formulation, large
gauge transformations have also been considered in ref. [7], and utilized in ref. [17] for the
schwinger model. the particular large gauge transformation we are considering here is a
light-front analog of the equal-time nite-volume central conjugations of ref.
[18]. it is

12

easy to check that this transformation leaves p invariant, and shifts q: q  q + /gl.

thus, the theory should be invariant with respect to this shift, because it is a remnant gauge
transformation. the invariance is achieved by the condition on the wavefunctions in the
q-representation:



(cid:18)q +

gl(cid:19) = ei(q),
where  is an angle, 0   < 2, parameterizing the theory.
in fact, the allowed values for the  in eq. (30) are 0 and . this is the case because the
double action of the above large gauge transformation on the gauge elds leaves both p and
q invariant. to see this, notice that q is expressible in terms of the trace of a large wilson
loop, and the latter changes its sign under the single action of u. for more explanations,
see refs. [16, 18]. in what follows, we introduce the label e for the superselection sectors of
the theory: e = 0 for  = 0 and e = 1 for  = . the notation is in accord with the one of
refs. [16, 18] and is to remind of the connection with the values of the electric ux.

(30)

another way to introduce the above superselection sectors is to notice that q is restricted

by eq. (19) to its fundamental modular domain [19]:

0  q 


gl

.

(31)

then, in the sector e = 0 the wave functions are periodic, and in the sector e = 1, antiperi-
odic:

(0) = (1)e(cid:18) 

gl(cid:19).

(32)

(33)

condition (32) singles out a discrete spectrum of the admissible values for p :

p (n) = 2gl(cid:18)n +

e

2(cid:19),

where n is an integer, and e is either zero or unit electric ux. recalling that hred =
p 2/(2v) = p+|(p

=0), we conclude that the spectrum of p+ in the subspace p = 0 is

p+|(p

6 discussion and conclusion

our central result, eq. (34), shows that the presence of a mass gap in innite volume theory
depends on the ordering of the limiting procedure. if one takes rst the limit v   then
there is no mass gap, and if one takes rst l   then there is a mass gap.
we note that the dependence of the thermodynamic state on the limiting procedure is
also present in statistical mechanics, where a non-unique limit is generally associated with
some sort of rst-order phase transition and may indeed be considered as a possible denition

13

of a phase transition [20]. on a physically motivated way to select the right state see ref.
[21].

thus, we interpret the nonexistence of the innite volume limit in our case as the indica-
tion of the presence of the rst-order phase transition in gluodynamics. this is an acceptable
feature in view of the expected presence of the deconnement phase transition and quark-
gluon plasma in qcd [22]. obviously, signicant work is needed to reconcile our approach
with what is known about the phase structure of qcd.

having arrived at such simple spectrum, eq. (34), could explain how previous approx-
imate treatments yielded results seemingly valid beyond limitations of underlying assump-
tions [23].

there is similarity of our results with recent works on yang-mills elds decomposition
[24, 25] which leads to the abelian dominance [11]. however, those equal time approaches
are linked with choice of a proper gauge [10] or with a nonlocal variable transformation
[25], while we have obtained our results without a gauge xing in nite volume light-front
formulation.

the next steps for development are the generalization to the su(n) case and the inclusion
of fermions. in general, the results for the theory with fermions can dier drastically from
pure gauge theory such as the gluodynamics considered here.

note that the nite volume light-front formulation may play an important role for string
theory, where one has to quantize a compactied theory. since we have obtained a light-front
formulation without a gauge xing and in nite volume our results can stimulate a deeper
understanding of a relation with novel m-theory developments [5].

to conclude, we gave a canonical formulation of the light-front su(2) gluodynamics
without a gauge xing. the gauss law was determined and the system was qualied as a
generalized dynamical system with rst class constraints. the spectrum (34) of the light-
front hamiltonian p+ was determined in the subspace of zero p for the case of the theory
compactied on a torus. an unexpected feature of the spectrum is that the distance between
the levels of p+ may vanish in the limit of innite volume, depending on the way the limit is
taken. this suggests the possibility of the presence of massless states in certain phases of
the innite volume theory obtained via the limiting procedures with the vanishing quantum
of p+. there are obvious possibilities to further develop the formalism: to generalize for
su(n), to include fermions, to develop the perturbation theory in various gauges at nite
and at innite volume, etc. some of these problems will be addressed in ref. [26].
