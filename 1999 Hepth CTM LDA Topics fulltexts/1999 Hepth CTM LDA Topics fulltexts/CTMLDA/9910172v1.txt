we study the d-brane spectrum on a two-parameter calabi-yau model. the analysis is

based on dierent tools in distinct regions of the moduli space: wrapped brane congura-

tions on elliptic brations near the large radius limit, and scft boundary states at the

gepner point. we develop an explicit correspondence between these two classes of objects,

suggesting that boundary states are natural quantum generalizations of bundles. we also

nd interesting d-brane dynamics in deep stringy regimes. the most striking example is,

perhaps, that nonsupersymmetric d6-d0 and d4-d2 large radius congurations become

stable bps states at the gepner point.

1. introduction

since their discovery [1], d-branes have been an ubiquitous presence in string dualities

and m theory. however, in spite of a detailed understanding of d-brane dynamics in at

space, their behavior in abstract conformal eld theories is less understood. a particular

class of string vacua where d-brane spectra are especially interesting consists of (2, 2) su-

perconfomal eld theories (scft). the moduli spaces of (2, 2) scfts are usually aected

by stringy quantum corrections which result in a very rich phase structure. one typically

has geometric phases, where classical geometry can be used at least as a guiding princi-

ple in describing the physics, and nongeometric phases where the semiclassical description

breaks down. it is known that the closed string quantum corrections result in a quantum

deformation of the classical cohomology rings of varieties. loosely, one can think of chiral

primary operators in abstract scfts as representing quantum deformations of classical

cohomology cycles.

adding d-branes is essentially equivalent to adding boundaries (with appropriate

boundary conditions) to the string worldsheet. the coupling to the open string sector

adds new ingredients to the space-time physics. in geometric phases, the new degrees of

freedom can be described semiclassically as gauge elds living on various submanifolds of

space-time. therefore, as explained in [2,3], in a geometric phase, d-branes are naturally

described as k theory classes rather than singular cohomology classes. however, such an

explicit and intuitive description is lacking in deep stringy regimes. given the breakdown

of the classical geometry in these regions, one has to rely on abstract scft techniques

(whenever possible) in order to classify d-brane charges and study their dynamics. an

eective approach to this problem relies on the formalism of boundary states, which can

be loosely thought as closed string coherent states solving the scft boundary conditions.

in this context, boundary states seem to be the natural quantum deformations of vector

bundles.

the main point of the present paper is the interplay between the two dierent de-

scriptions of d-branes in n = 2 string vacua. the natural framework, which insures

an explicit description in both regimes, consists of calabi-yau compactications contin-

uously connected to gepner models. since the latter are exactly solvable scfts one

can construct explicit boundary states solving cardys consistency condition [4,5,6]. this

oers detailed information on part of the spectrum of branes in a nongeometric phase.

as outlined above, we would like to understand if these states have a denite geomet-

1

ric interpretation in terms of d-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles in a calabi-yau

manifold of very large radius. restricting our attention to the charges of bps states (i.e.

ignoring dynamical aspects such as stability and existence of bound states) this question

can be systematically answered once the exact special geometry of the moduli space is

known. the map between the symplectic charge lattices can be found using the boundary

state representation of the symplectic intersection form described in [7]. note that this

map allows one to determine the eective bps charges of the gepner model boundary

states as seen by a low energy observer. for b type boundary states [8] (which correspond

to d-branes wrapping even homology cycles), these are not the same as the microscopic

d-brane charges, since the former include gravitational corrections [9,10,11,2,12]. in such

cases, the relation between the microscopic and eective charges involves the computation

of a mukai vector. the question of relating physical bps states in the two regimes is more

subtle and it requires a more detailed knowledge of the geometry of the calabi-yau variety

near the large radius limit, including detailed results on the classication of vector bundles

and special lagrangian cycles.

in order to obtain concrete results, we focus on b type boundary states in the two

parameter model p1,1,1,6,9
faces exhibit a structure of elliptically bered calabi-yau varieties which facilitates the

[18] of [13]. after resolving the singularities, these hypersur-

4

construction of the relevant holomorphic bundles (or sheaves). exploiting this feature, we

explicitly analyze moduli and stability questions of gepner model bps states in the large

radius limit. similar issues have been addressed in [14] for the quintic and [15] for local

orbifold models.

at the gepner point, the boundary states are generically organized in orbits of a

discrete symmetry group (in the present model z18, as detailed in section four). we nd
that, within a given orbit, certain gepner model states become unstable in the geometric

region, signaling the crossover of a wall of marginal stability. at the same time, an impor-

tant fraction of states in the same orbit are supersymmetric and stable in the large radius

limit. this shows that the discrete z18 symmetry is not a good symmetry in the geometric
phase.

perhaps the most striking examples consist of the nonsupersymmetric d6 + d0 and

respectively d4 + d2 states, which are repulsive in the large volume limit. on the other

hand, they can be shown to correspond to supersymmetric gepner model boundary states,

giving explicit examples for the transitions predicted in [14]. this result is particularly

2

interesting when interpreted in terms of d3-branes wrapping middle homology cycles in

the mirror manifold. according to [16], mirror symmetry can be thought as t-duality on
the t 3 bers of a special lagrangian bration. a calabi-yau hypersurface x near the large
radius limit is mapped to a mirror manifold x in a neighborhood of the large complex
structure limit. this transformation maps the d0-brane to a d3-brane wrapping the t 3
bers of the dual bration, while the d6-brane is mapped to a d3-brane wrapping the
base b of the bration. therefore our analysis shows that for x in a certain neighborhood
of the large complex structure limit, there should not exist any special lagrangian cycle in
the homology class t 3 + b. however, in a dierent region of the complex structure moduli
space of x, that maps to a neighborhood of the gepner point, the same homology class
should actually contain a special lagrangian cycle that corresponds to the supersymmetric

gepner model boundary state. this provides a concrete example, in a compact calabi-yau

space, for the transitions discussed in [17] and from a physical point of view in [18]. it

would be very interesting to understand the mathematical details of this transition in the

present context, but we leave this for future work.

for the boundary states that correspond to supersymmetric brane congurations, we

nd a remarkable agreement between the number of moduli computed in the two regions.

this suggests that the superpotential couplings considered in [14] vanish in this model,

but we do not check this explicitly. also, an interesting point is the presence of a gepner

model boundary state with the charge of a single d0-brane (unlike the quintic studied in

[14]). this shows that d0-branes are not necessarily a sign of geometrical compactication.

the paper is structured as follows. section two consists of a brief review of classical

and quantum aspects of the two parameter model of [13]. in section three, we explain the

relation between microscopic d-branes and bps states on the moduli space. section four is

devoted to boundary states in the gepner model, emphasizing the scft intersection form

and marginal deformations. in section ve we tie together all loose ends and construct an

explicit map between gepner boundary states and d-branes.

2. the geometry of the elliptic model

this section consists of a brief review of the classical and quantum geometry of the

two parameter model of [13]. we focus on facts of direct relevance to the spectrum of bps

states in a neighborhood of the gepner point and respectively the large radius limit.

[18] describes degree 18 hypersurfaces in the weighted

5 = 0

in the homogeneous coordinates

(z1, z2, z3, z4, z5) = (z1, z2, z3, 6z4, 9z5).

(2.1)

(2.2)

from this representation, it is easy to see that p(1,1,1,6,9)
has a singular line along z1 =
z2 = z3 = 0, which intersects x in a single point. blowing up this singular line gives an
exceptional divisor e in x. another divisor s is dened by the rst order polynomials

4

in x1, x2 and x3. these two divisors generate h4(x, z). the elliptic bration structure
is induced by the linear system |s| generated by z1, z2 and z3 which maps x to p2.
this bration has a section given by the exceptional divisor e. the generic ber can be

proved to be an elliptic curve, whose homology class in h2(x) will be denoted by h. the
second generator l of h2(x, z) is the hyperplane class of e. for further use, we record
the intersection relations

h = s2,

l = e  s,

h  e = 1,

h  s = 0,

l  e = 3,

l, s = 1

(2.3)

e2 = 9,

e2  s = 3,

e  s2 = 1,

s3 = 0.

we choose the generators1 of the kahler cone to be (e, s), so that a generic kahler class is

written j = t1e + t2s, where (t1, t2) are classical coordinates on the kahler moduli space.

2.2. quantum geometry

since the classical structure of the kahler moduli space of x is deformed by stringy

 corrections, exact results can be obtained by considering the complex structure moduli
space of the mirror x. as explained in [13], the mirror family can be obtained by applying

1 note that this choice is dierent from that of [13] where the generators are h = e + 3s and
s. therefore, their coordinates are related by a linear transformation to ours. the present choice

is motivated by the relation to d-brane states which will be explained latter.

the greene-plesser construction [19]. this results in a two parameter family of complex

varieties of the form

(2.4)

the complex parameters (, ) are subject to certain discrete identications, therefore

they are actually coordinates on a cover of the moduli space.

the exact special geometry of this model is described by a six-vector of periods  

(1 . . . 5)t = (cid:0)f 0, f 1, f 2, 1, t1, t2(cid:1)t

inhomogeneous coordinates (t1, t2) in a neighborhood of the large radius limit, we have
the following asymptotic expansion [13]

note that  represents the vector of periods of the holomorphic three-form  on the mirror
manifold x with respect to an integral basis of three-cycles. due to the dierent choice of
generators of the kahler cone, this basis is not canonical symplectic as in [13]. in particular,

the intersection form is given by

(2.6)

in order to interpolate between gepner model boundary states and large radius limit

branes, the periods (2.5) must be analytically continued to a neighborhood of the gepner

point. the natural basis of periods in this region is described by an overcomplete eighteen-
vector (0, . . . , 17)t whose entries are cyclically permuted by the quantum z18 discrete
symmetry of the gepner model. these periods satisfy the relations

i + i+9 = 0,

i  i+3 + i+6 = 0,

5

(2.7)

which leave only six independent periods (0,    , 5)t. the periods  and  are related
by analytic continuation, resulting in  = m with the connection matrix

with respect to the basis of periods (0, . . . , 5)t, the intersection form on h 3( x, z) takes

(2.9)

using the relations (2.7), the matrix ig can be expressed in terms of a z18 shift matrix

ig = g17(1  g17)(1  g12)(1  g9).

(2.10)

this particular form of the intersection matrix will play an important role in the interpo-

lation between the gepner point and the large radius limit.

finally, let us note that the large radius point sits at the intersection of two divisors

on the boundary of the moduli space. [13]. the monodromy matrices about the

g1, d
two divisors, expressed with respect to the basis of periods (2.5), read

(2.11)

these monodromy transformations correspond to shifting the b-eld by the integral coho-

mology classes h = e + 3s and respectively s. in the next section they will be reinter-

preted as natural automorphisms of the k theory group of x. this is a simple particular

case of a more ambitious program which proposes an identication between the derived

category of complexes of sheaves of x and the fukaya-floer category of special lagrangian
submanifolds of x. [20,21,22,23]. a systematic and general approach will appear in [24].

6

3. d-branes and periods

in this section we explore the relation between the spectrum of bps states of this

model and microscopic d-brane states in the large volume limit. before discussing the

technical aspects of the problem, a couple of guiding remarks are in order. the bps

charge lattice of the low energy eective theory is an integral symplectic lattice which can
be identied with the middle cohomology lattice of the mirror manifold h 3( x, z). the
central charge corresponding to an integral vector (n6, n1

4, n0, n1

4, n2

2, n2

2) is

z = n61 + n1

42 + n2

43 + n04 + n1

25 + n2

26.

(3.1)

on the other hand, in the large radius limit, the lattice of microscopic d-brane charges is

an integral quadratic lattice identied with the k theory lattice k(x). the map between

these lattices is a nontrivial question in mirror symmetry, being related to the current

eorts of extending the mirror principle to calabi-yau spaces with bundles. in the present

case, we will construct a map between the low energy charges n and the topological in-

variants of the k theory class  by exploiting the exact form of d-brane chern-simons

couplings worked out in [9,10,11,2,12]. the topological invariants of  are simply given by

the chern character ch(). the eective charges of a d-brane state represented by  are
measured by the mukai vector q  h 0(x)  h 2(x)  h 4(x)  h 6(x) given by

the central charge associated to this state is then2

q = ch ()ptd (x).

z(t) =

t3

q0

q2 + tq4  q6.

(3.2)

(3.3)

the comparison of (3.1) and (3.3) gives the relation between the low energy charges and

the topological invariants of . we derive next explicit formulae for the cases when 

describes either d6-branes wrapped on x or d4-branes wrapped on submanifolds of x.

more general situations (for example if  is not representable by a sheaf on x) can be

treated similarly.

2 note that our conventions are such that d0-brane congurations have rx ch3 < 0. the

associated k theory class is [op ] rather than [op ], where op is a skyscraper sheaf of length

one supported at the point p . similarly, a d2-brane wrapping a curve c  x is represented by

the k theory class [oc] rather than [oc ].

7

3.1. the d6-brane

we now consider d-brane systems with nonzero d6-charge which can be represented

by holomorphic vector bundles on x. in fact, it will turn out that this condition is too

restrictive and we will actually have to enlarge the class of geometrical objects to coherent

sheaves on x. note also that the corresponding d-brane conguration is supersymmetric
only if v is a stable sheaf 3 [11]. expanding (3.2), we obtain

q = (cid:18)r, c1(v ), ch2 (v ) +

r
24

c2(x), ch3 (v ) +

1
24

c1(v )c2(x)(cid:19) .

(3.4)

the associated central charge formula is therefore

3 we will not give the explicit denition of stability here. the donaldson-uhlenbeck-yau theo-
rem shows that stability is essentially equivalent with self-duality of the gauge eld conguration,

which is more familiar to physicists.

8

these formulae relate the topological invariants of the sheaf v to the eective charges

n, as promised. in the next sections, they will play an important role in identifying the

geometric properties of the gepner model boundary states.

before moving on to more general d-brane congurations, note that we can use the

above explicit formulae to convert the monodromy transformations (2.11) into automor-

phisms of k(x), as promised before. more precisely, we claim that the two monodromy

transformations correspond to the following automorphisms

[v ]  [v  ox (h)] ,

[v ]  [v  ox (s)] ,

(3.8)

where v is a coherent sheaf on x. to show this, note that tensoring by a line bundle

ox (d) changes the topological invariants of v as follows

r (v ) = r(v )

ch1 (v ) = ch1 (v ) + rd

ch2 (v ) = ch2 (v ) + ch1 (v )d +

ch3 (v ) = ch3 (v ) + ch2 (v )d +

(3.9)

where v   v  ox (d). using (3.6), a direct computation shows that the linear transfor-

mations acting on n corresponding to d = h, s are precisely given by

m (h) = s11,

m (s) = s21,

(3.10)

where s1, s2 are the monodromy matrices in (2.11). this proves the claim.

3.2. d4-brane

a dierent class of d-brane states can be obtained by wrapping lower even dimensional

branes on submanifolds of i : d  x. in order to obtain supersymmetric congurations,

d has to be a holomorphic cycle [25,8]. multiple brane congurations are described as

above by a coherent sheaf v on d, which is required to be stable. the associated k theory

class in k(x) is simply dened by the torsion coherent sheaf iv which is the extension

of v by zero to x. then, the mukai vector can be computed by a simple application of

the grothendieck-riemann-roch formula for the embedding i : d  x

i


(ch (v )td (d)) = ch (i


v )td (x).

(3.11)

9

note that this formula relates the topological invariants of the sheaf v on d to the topo-

logical invariants of the torsion sheaf iv on x. a direct expansion yields

ch1 (i

(3.12)

(3.13)

in the last entry of the above formula, the top chern classes are evaluated on the cor-

responding fundamental cycles, resulting in numerical invariants. using an adjunction

formula

dc2(x) = c2(d)  d3 = c2(d)  c1(d)2,

(3.14)

the charge vector can be rewritten

q = (cid:18)0, rd, i

applications, we derive explicit formulae for multiple d4-branes with lower induced charges

wrapping the cycles e and s on the elliptic bration.

branes wrapped on e correspond to bps states with charge vectors of the form4

more general congurations involving various congurations of d4-branes and d2-branes

4. boundary states in the gepner model

as explained before, the gepner point is a special point in the moduli space where

the superconformal eld theory is exactly solvable [26,27,28]. this feature allows us to

obtain valuable information on the spectrum of bps states in a deep stringy regime of the

theory. in the present section, we explain the construction of b type boundary state in the

11

(k = 16)3(k = 1) gepner model which is continuously connected to the elliptic calabi-yau

compactication considered in the previous sections. the construction is closely related

to the one applied to rational conformal eld theories in [29] and it has been considered

in detail in [4,5,6]. our approach is focused on the conformal eld theory computation of

the symplectic intersection form on the bps charge lattice [30]. as in [14], this is a crucial

ingredient in the geometric interpretation of gepner model boundary states.

the b type boundary states at the gepner point (k = 16)3(k = 1) are labeled as in

[14] by |l1, l2, l3, l4; m ; si where 0  l1, l2, l3  8, l4 = 0, m  z36

m =

4

xi=1

kmi
ki + 2

(4.1)

with k = l.c.m.{ki + 2} and s  2z2. for xed l = (li), the states with dierent (m, s)
form an orbit under the z18 discrete symmetry group and the two values of s correspond
to a brane and the corresponding antibrane.

4.1. the intersection form

a rst step in deriving a geometric interpretation of the gepner model boundary states

is to calculate their intersection numbers using exact conformal eld theory techniques.
as explained in [31,30,14], these numbers can be obtained by computing tr(1)f in the

internal part of the open string r sector. since this quantity is an index, it is unchanged

under marginal deformations of the scft on the moduli space. therefore it can be reliably

compared with the large radius limit intersection matrix given by (2.9) in a basis adapted

to the z18 symmetry of the gepner point. an explicit calculation gives

where n l

are the su (2)k fusion rule coecients. this formula is very cumbersome, but

it can be rewritten in a much simpler form. to this end one can note that the states within

one z18 orbit (lj are xed) can be labeled by a 36 dimensional row vector qb with all
entries equal to zero, except for the m th entry, which equals one.

in this notation the intersection matrices for boundary states in xed orbits of the

z18 symmetry can be expressed in terms of shift matrices g. each factor n
can be replaced in matrix notation by a factor 5

(4.3)

5 the matrix g

1

2 is understood as the basic 36-dimensional shift matrix.

12

the delta function constraint is a shifted u (1) projection, showing that the intersection

matrix is z18 invariant.

as specied before, the bps charge vectors associated to the gepner model boundary

states can be found by comparing the intersection matrices (4.2) and (2.10). it turns out

that it is more convenient to work in a dierent basis for boundary states, related to the
present one by the linear transformation 1

2 (cid:0)1  g9(cid:1). in the new basis, the matrix (4.2)

reads

ib = (1  g17)3(1  g12)(1  g9).

(4.4)

this is antisymmetric and easy combinatorics shows that its rank is 6. from (2.10) and

(4.4) it can be seen that the two matrices ig and ib are related by

ib = (1  g)ig(1  g)t.

(4.5)

this connects the series of boundary states with (lj) = (0,    , 0) to the basis of periods

 at the gepner point.

to nd the charges of boundary states with lj 6= 0 one has to nd a linear transfor-
mation tl which generates the dierent factors nl, l from n0,0 = (1  g1). the change of
basis is expressible in terms of g

tl = tt

l =

l
2

xl=

l
2

gl.

(4.6)

the rst step in verifying this is to relate nl,0 to n0,0

tln0,0 =

xl=

gl(1  g1) =

xl=

multiplying this with t l one gets

(gl  gl1) = nl, l.

(4.8)

the charge of the boundary state qb in the gepner basis is then given by qg =

qbtl1 tl2tl3 (1  g). this row vector has only entries in the even columns, which means
that all the odd columns can be omitted, leaving a 18 dimensional vector. there are only 6

independent charges and the relations (2.7) can be used to reduce qg to its rst 6 entries.

the large radius charge ql is then easily calculated from the reduced qb by ql = qgm.

13

4.2. marginal operators

for comparison with geometric results it will be interesting to compute the number

of boundary marginal operators. as explained in [14] they can be expressed in terms of
the matrices nl, l = |nl, l|. the number of boundary marginal operators for only one
boundary state |lj, m, si is given by the diagonal part of

1
2

nl1,l1 nl2,l2 nl3,l3 (1 + g12)(1 + g9)  #vac.

(4.9)

the number of vacua is normally 1 and for each lj = 8 it is multiplied by 2. the following

table shows the number of marginal operators for some important boundary states

(l1, l2, l3) #(marg) #(vac)

(0, 0, 0)
(1, 0, 0)
(2, 0, 0)
(3, 0, 0)

these boundary operators are massless, but they might have a superpotential, with at

directions corresponding to the truly marginal operators.

if the number of vacua in the open string sector is dierent from zero, e.g.

two,

one might think of the boundary state as two dierent d-branes. this would t with

the picture of a coulomb branch in the world volume theory in which the gauge group
is u (1)2. the reason that these boundary states appear in the formalism of the gepner

model as a single boundary state could be related to the higher symmetry algebra that

these boundary states respect.

5. boundary states and vector bundles

in this nal section, we collect the results obtained so far and establish an explicit

connection between gepner model d-branes and supersymmetric brane congurations on

the elliptically bered calabi-yau variety. to summarize, this process essentially involves

two stages. first, we interpret the boundary states at the gepner point as generic bps

states on the moduli space. the next step involves a translation of the bps charge vectors n

14

into microscopic d-brane charges using the chern-simons couplings as explained in section

three. note that this procedure involves analytic continuation between two distinct regions

of the moduli space, therefore the spectrum of bps states may be aected by jumping and

marginal stability phenomena. we will not attempt to give a comprehensive study of

these issues here, but the geometric picture will eventually provide signicant information

on the stability of the gepner model d-branes in the large radius limit. moreover, we will

also compare the number of moduli of a given d-brane conguration in the two regimes,

nding a remarkable agreement. this suggests that the marginal deformations found in

section 4.2 are in fact truly marginal and the corresponding at directions are not lifted

by superpotential couplings. note that an exhaustive treatment of all gepner boundary

states is not possible due to their large number (1485, according to some combinatorial

arguments). therefore we will restrict in the following to a subset of states which admit a

simple geometric interpretation.

5.1. l = (0000)

the simplest series is l = (0000). the 18 states forming a z18 orbit are grouped in
d-brane/anti-d-brane pairs, therefore there are only 9 relevant charge vectors, which are

listed in the following table

the corresponding topological invariants can be computed by a direct application of the

formulae in sections 3.1 and 3.2. we nd that the states n1, n3, n4, n5 correspond to
the complex holomorphic line bundles ox , ox (e  s), ox (e), ox (s) respectively.

these are clearly stable and describe supersymmetric single d6-brane congurations with
induced anti-d4 charges. they are also rigid, since h0,1(x) = 0, therefore the number

of moduli is zero, in agreement with the results in 3.5. similarly, the states n6 and n8
correspond to the holomorphic line bundles oe and oe(l) on the section e  p2 of the

15

elliptic bration. these are again stable and rigid and correspond to single d4-branes on

e.

the remaining states, n2,7,9 are more interesting since they correspond to multiple
branes. the rst charge is associated to a vector bundle v on x with topological invariants

r(v ) = 2,

c1(v ) = s,

c2(v ) = h,

c3(v ) = 0.

(5.2)

a holomorphic vector bundle with these characteristics can be easily constructed as a pull
back of a rank two vector bundle w on the base p2, v = w . for w , we nd

r(w ) = 2,

c1(w ) = l,

c2(w ) = 1

(5.3)

and it turns out that this is an exceptional bundle6 on the projective plane p2 [32,33].

in particular, w is stable and rigid. we can prove that v is also rigid as follows. the

innitesimal deformations of v on x are parameterized by a the cohomology group

h 1 (x, end(v )) = h 1 (x, v  v ) = h 1 (x, (w  w )) .

(5.4)

this can be evaluated using the leray spectral sequence for  : x  b

h 1 (x, (w  w ))  h 0 (b, w  w   kb)  h 1 (b, w  w ) .

(5.5)

using kodaira-serre duality, we have

h 0 (b, w  w   kb)  h 2 (b, end(w )) = 0

h 1 (b, w  w ) = h 1 (b, end(w )) = 0,

(5.6)

since w is exceptional. therefore v is indeed rigid and it can be proved similarly that v

is also simple i.e. it has no nontrivial automorphisms hom (v, v )  c. the stability of v

is harder to analyze and we have not been able to obtain a denite result.

next, it can be checked that the state n7 represents a d4-brane with multiplicity two
wrapped on the section e. the associated vector bundle turns out to be in fact isomorphic

to the exceptional bundle w considered in the previous paragraph. this is rigid and stable,

therefore we obtain a supersymmetric conguration with no moduli. finally, the ninth

state corresponds to a bundle v with topological invariants

r(v ) = 2,

c1(v ) = 2e  s,

c2(v ) = h  2l,

c3 = 0.

(5.7)

6 exceptional bundles on a surface are in general characterized by h 1(end(w ))  0 and

h 2(end(w ))  0. on the projective plane, one can prove that this implies stability.

16

a bundle with these topological invariants can be easily constructed as v  w 
ox (e). its properties are similar to those of w i.e. v is rigid and simple.

to summarize the results, we have found that all states, except possibly n2, n7 and
n9, are stable and supersymmetric in the large radius limit. moreover, the number of
geometric moduli agrees with the number of marginal deformations of the boundary states.

this provides supporting evidence for the decoupling of the bulk kahler moduli argued in

[14]. the states n2, n7 and n9 are more intriguing since we have not been able to settle
the issue of stability in the large radius limit. on the other hand, since the associated

bundles are simple, these d-brane congurations should correspond to one particle states

in the four dimensional eective theory. if the bundles turn out to be unstable, it would

be interesting to understand if these are stable non-bps states in the large radius limit.

next, we consider another group of gepner model boundary states which lead to more

interesting physical congurations.

the rst charge vector in this series is particularly interesting since it corresponds to a

d0-brane on x. formally, this is described by a k theory class   k(x) with topological

invariants

r() = 0,

ch1 () = 0,

ch2 () = 0,

ch3 () = 1.

(5.9)

this identies  as [op ] where op is a skyscraper sheaf of length one supported at the

point p  x. the next two states n2,3 also have a simple physical interpretation. they
correspond to a d2-brane wrapped on the elliptic ber and respectively to a d2-brane

wrapped on the elliptic ber with a magnetic ux inducing one unit of d0-charge. the

k theory classes can be easily constructed. pick i : y  x to be an arbitrary smooth

17

elliptic ber in the class h and pick ly to be a holomorphic line bundle on y . we must

have deg(ly ) = 0 for n2 and deg(ly ) = 1 for n3. then the required k theory class
is  = [ily ]. all these congurations are supersymmetric and we can also determine

the moduli space. for a d0-brane, the moduli space is simply isomorphic to x. for
the d2-branes, the moduli are parameterized by a point in the base p2 representing the

projection of the elliptic ber y and the choice of a at line bundle on y (specifying

the wilson lines). therefore the global moduli space for d2-branes is isomorphic to the

relative jacobian variety of x, which is in turn isomorphic to x itself since the elliptic

bration has only nodal and cuspidal bers. moreover, the number of moduli agrees with

the number of marginal deformations computed at the gepner point, supporting again the

decoupling of kahler moduli argued in [14].

next, the states n4 . . . n7 have one unit of d6-charge. n4 is particularly interesting

since the topological invariants

r() = 1,

ch1 () = 0,

ch2 () = 0,

ch3 () = 1

(5.10)

identify the ideal sheaf of a single point p on x. in the present conventions, this corre-

sponds to a d6-d0 system which is very interesting. in at space it is known that d6-d0

systems are repulsive and they break supersymmetry completely. on a curved manifold,

the open string dynamics is harder to analyze, but in the large radius limit, the d6-d0

potential should approach continuously the at space result. therefore, we expect this

conguration to be nonsupersymmetric and repulsive at suciently large radius. in par-

ticular, the repulsive interaction prevents the occurrence of a bound state. this gives a

clear example supersymmetric gepner model state which decays in a nonsupersymmetric

combination of d-branes in the large radius limit. such phenomena have been predicted
in [14]. this picture is especially interesting when interpreted from the mirror x point of
view. as also mentioned in the introduction, we obtain an example of a phase transition of
special lagrangian cycles as we move on the complex structure moduli space of x. regard-
ing mirror symmetry as t-duality as in [16], x and x admit special lagrangian brations
with dual t 3, t 3 bers. then the d6 and d0-branes on x are mapped to d3-branes
wrapping the base b of the bration and respectively the t 3 ber. the previous argu-
ment shows that the homology class b + t 3 should not support a special lagrangian cycle
in a neighborhood of the large complex structure limit of x. however, it should support
such a cycle in a region of the moduli space of x which maps to a neighborhood of the

18

gepner point of x under the mirror map. this predicts transitions of the type discussed

in [17] in a concrete compact model.

the remaining states n5,6,7 correspond to various d6, d4 and d2 combinations whose
existence as bound states is an open problem. the topological charges can be easily

computed as above, but we will not pursue this here.

finally, the last two states n8,9 represent congurations with a d4-brane wrapped on
the section e of the elliptic bration and a d2-brane wrapped on an elliptic ber y . for
n9, the d4-brane carries a magnetic ux on a hyperplane in p2 which induces a lower d2-
brane charge. here, the dynamics is very similar to that of the d6-d0 system (in fact they

can be related by a t-duality on the elliptic ber). as x approaches the large radius limit,

the brane systems approach congurations of transverse d4-d2 branes in at space. these

are nonsupersymmetric and repulsive, therefore they cannot form bound states. hence,

we nd more examples of gepner model states which decay into non-bps congurations

in the large volume limit. they should be interpreted in terms of phase transitions of
special-lagrangian cycles on x, as before.

the other series of gepner model boundary states can be analyzed similarly, resulting

in various brane congurations. we will not pursue this systematically here, but we would

like to emphasize two other states which have not appeared in the previous cases. namely,

in the series l = (2100) (which is identical to l = (7000)), one nds the charge vectors n1 =
(0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1) and n2 = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0) which correspond to d4-branes wrapping
a vertical holomorphic four-cycle i : d  x in the class s. note that the surfaces in

this class are generically smooth elliptic brations over a rational curve in the class l. the

associated k theory classes are determined by the torsion sheaves i (jp +q  od(h  l))
and i (jp +q  od(h)), where jp +q is the ideal sheaf of two (possible coincident) points
on d. therefore, in both cases, we obtain a single d4-brane wrapped on d with two units

of d0-charge which correspond to d0-branes located at the points p, q. the d4-branes

also carry magnetic ux inducing lower d2-brane charges on curves in the class h  l and

respectively h. the existence of bound states with these charges is an open problem, but

the large radius limit analysis suggests that they might exist since the d4-d0-systems are

supersymmetric in at space. in fact, the bound states would have to be marginal, which

makes the existence problem very subtle.
