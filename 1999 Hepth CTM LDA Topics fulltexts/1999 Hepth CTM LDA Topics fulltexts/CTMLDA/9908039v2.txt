abstract

in a recent work (hep-th/9905198) we argued that a certain matrix quantum
mechanics may describe t hoofts monopoles which emerge in qcd when
the theory is projected to its maximal abelian subgroup. in this note we nd
further evidence which supports this interpretation. we study the theory with
a non-zero theta-term. in this case, t hoofts qcd monopoles become dyons
since they acquire electric charges due to the witten eect. we calculate a
potential between a dyon and an anti-dyon in the matrix quantum mechanics,
and nd that the attractive force between them grows as the theta angle
increases.

t hooft has shown [1] that a new and rich structure emerges in qcd when certain
unusual gauge xing conditions are imposed on the theory. this class of unitary gauges
projects qcd onto its maximal abelian subgroup, i.e., breaks su(n) down to u(1)n 1.
in addition to massless and massive gauge elds, which are present after this symmetry
breaking, some point-like monopoles emerge in the theory [1]. these monopoles appear
in a somewhat unusual way, as singularities of a chosen gauge xing condition. given
the importance of these monopoles in various analytic and lattice studies of qcd (see [2]
and references therein), it is desirable to have some gauge independent description of the
dynamics of these objects. recently, we addressed this issue in [3] by considering pure qcd
on a spatial three-torus. the t-dual form of pure qcd on a spatial torus can be interpreted
as a certain matrix quantum mechanics. in [3] some arguments were presented which lead us
to conjecture that this quantum mechanics describes the dynamics of t hoofts monopoles.
the aim of this note is to seek for further evidence in favor of this conjecture. below we
consider pure qcd with the theta term.
it is known that t hoofts monopoles acquire
electric charges due to the witten eect [4] once non-zero theta angle is introduced [1].
if the identication of the excitations of the matrix quantum mechanics with t hoofts
monopoles is correct, then the witten eect should also be seen within the matrix model.
in other words, if one calculates the interaction force between the point-like objects of the
matrix model, then this force should depend on the theta angle.
in fact, the attractive
force between a monopole and an antimonopole should be greater then it is for a zero theta
angle. in what follows we will show that this is indeed the case: an interacting monopole-
antimonopole pair becomes a dyon-anti-dyon pair once the theta angle is switched on, and
the attractive force between them grows as  increases.

consider four-dimensional pure su(n) qcd in the presence of the  angle. the corre-

sponding lagrangian density reads:

let   1/ym be the eective correlation length of the theory, where ym is the
dynamically generated qcd scale. let us compactify the theory on a rectangular three-
torus tl  s1  s1  s1 with the radii of all three circles equal l  . this corresponds
to the strong coupling regime of the theory (see discussions in [3]). we can rewrite pure
qcd compactied on tl as a matrix quantum mechanics compactied on a dual three-

ym + i/82. to avoid complications with

torus tr  es1  es1  es1 with the radii of all three circles equal r  /l, where the
parameter  is dened via the qcd scale ym as follows:    2 = 1/2
ym. in this t-
dual formulation of the theory the dynamical variables are time-dependent matrices i(t),
i = 1, 2, 3, transforming in the adjoint representation of (global) su(n). in addition to the
color indices, for a given value of the index i = 1, 2, 3, the matrices i also carry indices
corresponding to the winding modes.
in general, s give a matrix representation of a
covariant derivative on a torus [5].
in the following we will suppress for simplicity these
winding indices. the corresponding lagrangian of the matrix quantum mechanics (with the
appropriate normalization for i) is given by:

1

2g

tr   2

i +

1

2(2)2 [i, j]2 

i

2 ijk [i, j] k! ,

(2)

where i denotes the time derivative of i, and the traces over color and winding indices
(with appropriate normalizations) are implicit. this lagrangian should be amended by a
corresponding constraint equation (a counterpart of the gausss law) to describe pure qcd
in a t-dual picture [3]. the new coupling constant g is dened as follows:

g  (r/l)3/2g2

ym/4 .

(3)

also, the last term in (2) is due to the -term in (1), and the corresponding coupling  is
given by:

  2/1 = g2

ym/82 .

(4)

for  = 0 (2) reduces to the usual bosonic matrix quantum mechanics lagrangian [610,5,11].
following [3] the lagrangian (2) describes the dynamics of t hoofts qcd monopoles.
let us notice that in the limit l  , that is, r  , which we are interested in, the matrix
quantum mechanics (2) is as complicated a theory as strongly coupled pure qcd, the reason
being that it contains light winding modes (which map to the kaluza-klein modes in the
t-dual qcd description) whose masses scale as r/ = 1/l [3]. however, certain aspects of
pure qcd in a large volume (which is a strongly coupled theory) might be more transparent
in the matrix quantum mechanics approach. in particular, the monopole mass in the theory

is given by m = 1/2g, and in the regime we are discussing m  ym [3]. thus, it is

reasonable to consider interactions between monopoles when they are moving very slowly
(or, are almost at rest). at such a low energies the light winding modes are not yet excited
in the model. thus, we can neglect the contributions of these modes in the calculation.
on the matrix model side interactions between monopoles (a monopole-antimonopole pair)
are described by o-diagonal elements in i. thus, following [3], consider the u(2) case
where we have two monopoles with opposite magnetic charges. let us make the standard
decomposition of the  eld into its classical and quantum parts:

here we choose the classical solution as follows:

i = cl

i + i .

cl

0 r! , cl

2 = 0 , cl

3 = 0 .

that is, the two monopoles are at a distance r apart from each other in one of the spatial
directions. in order to nd an eective potential between them one performs integration
with respect to o-diagonal uctuations. in the absence of the -angle the eective potential
between the monopoles is given by (see [3] and references therein):

v (=0)
e

r
 .



(7)

in fact, the easiest way to deduce the eective potential in the presence of the -angle is to
rewrite the lagrangian (2) as follows:

3

l =

2g

tr   i 

i

2(2)

ijk [i, j]!2

1 + 2

2(2)2 [i, j]2 .

(8)

note that the dierence between the lagrangians with  = 0 and  6= 0 is in the redenition
of the conjugate momentum and rescaling   /1 + 2 in the term containing the
commutator [i, j]2 (which is responsible for interactions between monopoles)1. performing
explicitly integration of the o-diagonal excitations in (8), and calculating the corresponding
functional determinant, one nds the eective potential in the presence of the -angle

v (6=0)
e

= 1 + 2 v (=0)

e

.

(9)

we see that, as in the case without the -angle, there is a linearly rising potential between
a monopole and an anti-monopole. thus, there is a string stretched between them, and the
string tension ts has a non-trivial -dependence:

ts 

1 + 2 2

ym =q1 + (g2

ym/82)2 2

ym .

(10)

as a result, the attraction force between the pair increases when the theta angle is switched
on. this corresponds to the fact that monopoles acquire electric charges and become dyons.
this is consistent with the fact that we expect wittens eect [4] to take place for magnetic
monopoles - a monopole with a magnetic charge h becomes a dyon with the electric charge

ym

e =(cid:16)g2

162(cid:17) h

(11)

in the presence of the  angle [4,1]. thus, the fact that the interaction force derived from
the above matrix quantum mechanics depends non-trivially on the -angle gives additional
evidence that t hoofts qcd monopoles might indeed be described by the former. dyons
in this case can (very roughly) be thought of as complicated bound states of a monopole
and o-diagonal gluons.

let us also point out that the string tension ts is invariant under the s-duality transfor-
mation   1/ . on the other hand, at rst it might appear strange that it is not invariant
under the shift    + 2. this is, however, expected as the electric charge e given by (11)
is not invariant under such shifts either; the charge (11) gets shifted by a fundamental unit
of the electric charge (which in our notations is g2
ymh/8. this
can be interpreted as follows: t hoofts dyons at  can be viewed as a bound state of the
corresponding dyon at   2 and a gluon [1].

theta along with the quadratic term arising in front of the commutator [i , j]2.
