1 introduction

superconformal algebras have been studied for a long time in physical literatures. the importance
is above all due to the fact that the superconformal algebra describes the underling symmetries of
superstring theory. a superconformal algebra is a simple lie superalgebra ( over ic) spanned by
modes of a nite family of local elds, which contains the virasoro and some other odd , even ones,
such that the coecients of the operator product expansions are linear combinations of elds in the
family and their derivatives. this innite-dimensional algebra possesses a very rich mathematical
structure with vast applications on dierent branches in mathematics and physics. nevertheless,
only until recent years, some rigorously systematic study of conformal superalgebras from the
mathematical point of view has been worked out by groups of mathematicans and physicists, and
profound mathematical structures have been found to further enhance our understanding of the
original physical content (see, for instance [5] [9] and references therein). however, despite the many
theories of conformal algebras, the n=2 conformal theory has a peculiar nature which denes a
class of its own, due to its intimate relation with kahler geometry, a main core in the analytical
study of projective manifolds. hence in the study of n=2 conformal algebra an important aspect
will be its applications on the geometry of manifolds, e.g., their topological invariants; a notable
one would be the relation with elliptic genus of manifolds with c1 = 0, (see for instance [8] [10] [12]
[14] and references therein), which amounts to considering so called the gepner model construction
of the rational conformal theory [6]. due to the length of presentation and also the nature of the
contents, we shall only discuss the representation-theory aspect of the n=2 conformal algebra in
this paper, and consider its topological application as a separate problem, which will be treated
in another one. in this work, we return to the problem of the study of functional properties of
characters of the rational n=2 conformal theory from both the quantitative and qualitative point
of views. while working on characters, one usually denes them as the formal laurent series;
while a proper theta function representation is expected for the discussion of symmetrical nature
among characters. by coorperating the characteristic of theta functions into the twisted currents
of the algebra, we obtain a theta function (with characteristic) presentation of characters of the
unitary irreducible highest weight module (hwm) of n=2 conformal algebra for dierent sectors,
(see theorem 1 of the content ). this explict form of characters in terms of theta functions, which
seems to be unknown before to the best of the authors knowledge, does provide a convenient
formulation for the discussion of global functional properties through the classical theory of elliptic
functions. deceptively simple as it may appear, this is an crucial observation, since it implies that
in this formulation, the symmetries between characters of the rational n=2 conformal theory for a
xed central charge are revealed and the geometrical applications could be possibly achieved later
on [13].

the paper is organized as follows. in sect.2, we give a brief introduction of elliptic and modular
functional properties of heisenberg and modular transformations, and we summarize a few known
facts concerning the jacobi-form like nature of theta functions (with charactersitic) in elliptic curve
theory. in sect.3, we rst summarize the basic facts about the n=2 conformal algebra and the
discrete series of unitary irreducible hwm for the central charge c < 3. then we obtain the
theta function representataion of charaters of these hwm for dierent sectors, which enable us to
further pursuit their qualitative functional properties, instead of only the ones from the laurent
series expression. in sect.4, we study the symmetric properties among characters of those hwm
in the discrete series for a xed central element. with the elliptic and modular functional relations,
they constitutes an irreducible representation for the cental extension of a jacobi-group, which
composes of a nite heisenberg group together with a certain modular group. we consider this
part one of the most delicate aspects of this paper. for this reason we describe, as precisely

2

as possible, the procedure of constructing the irreducible decomposition of the heisenberg group
with an explicit basis, by which a modular transformation is expressed as a matrix so that one
can see the relation of irreducible heisenberg-submodules under the modular action. the detailed
description will be given in theorem 2 of the paper. finally, as it is known in physical literatures,
( see for instance [7] and references therein), that superconformal algebras have certain superspace
geometrical realization, in which generators are presented as super-vector elds, (i.e., derivations),
of super spacetime. this type of geometrization for virasoro alegbra has been a well-known process,
by which the symmetric content of the algebra is better revealed. in the last section as an appendix,
we in particular recall and describe a detailed account of a geometrical realization of n=2 conformal
algebra as 1-dimensional vector elds with 2 supersymmetric extensions. the geometrical setting
oers a means to learn the superconformal symmetries, which have been the focus of the present
work.

convention . in this paper, ir, ic will denote the eld of real, complex numbers respectively,
and ih is the upper half plane, {  ic | im > 0}. by a representation of a group g on a (complex)
vector space v , we shall always mean a linear right-action of g on v ,

r : v  g  v ,

(v, g) 7 v  g := r(v, g) .

a r-eigenvector with the eigen-charactor  is an element v  v satises the relation:

v  g = (g)v , g  g .

2 elliptic and modular functional properties

let o( ic  ih),m( ic  ih) be the vector spaces of holomorphic, meromorphic functions of ic 
in this section, we shall give a brief review on some basic elliptic and modular
ih respectively.
functional properties of ic  ih, which will be needed for our later discussions. the ellipticity and
modularity we refer to here are the standard actions of ir2 and sl2(ir) on ic  ih,
(v, (z,  )) 7 (z + v1 + v2,  ), v = (v1, v2) ,
c +d ) , m =  a b
(m, (z,  )) 7 (

ir2  ( ic  ih)  ic  ih ,
sl2(ir)  ( ic  ih)  ic  ih,

c d ! .

c +d , a +b

z

for convenience , in this section we shall always use the letters, v1, v2, to denote the coordinates
of a vector v in ir2, and a, b, c, d, the entries of a matrix m of sl2(ir). denote ir2  sl2(ir)
the semi-product of ir2 and sl2(ir) with the conjugation of m  sl2(ir) on v  ir2 given by
m 1  v  m = vm (the matrix product). the above two actions give rise one of ir2  sl2(ir) on
ic  ih. we shall lift this geometrical action to functions of ic  ih. the elliptic part is as follows.
1 for v, v  ir2, and denote
let (ir2, <, >) be the skew-symmetric form, < v, v >:= v1v
ic
1 = {  ic | || = 1}. for d  ir, lg(d) is the (three-dimensional) heisenberg group (of index
d), ic

2  v2v

1  ir2, with the group law,

(, v)  (, v) = (e2idv2v

1 , v, v  ir2 .
1, ir2 as subsets of lg(d) by the following identication of elements,

for ,   ic

1, v + v) ,

we shall regard ic

ic
1   := (, 0)  lg(d) ,

ir2  v := (1, v)  lg(d) .

then lg(d) is generated by elements of ir2 with the relations,

v  v = e2id<v,v>v  v = e2idv2v

1(v + v)  lg(d) ,

for v, v  ir2.

3

as a character of lg(d) is always trivial on its center, the character-group of lg(d) is isomorphic to
the additive group ir2 by the correspondence: r  r  ir2, where r is the character of lg(d)
dened by r(v) = e2id<v,r> for v  ir2  lg(d). we shall denote (d) the subgroup of lg(d)
generated by integral elements in ir2. for d  zz, (d) is the abelian lattice group zz2, which will
be also denoted by  in what follows. for an arbtrary xed   ih, there is a representaion t ( ; d)
of lg(d) on entire functions of ic,

t (= t ( ; d)) : o( ic)  lg(d)  o( ic) ,

(, (, v)) 7 |t(,v) := (|tv) ,   ic

1, v  ir2 ,

where (|tv)(z) := edi(v2
hold:

1  +2v1(z+v2))(z + v1 + v2), z  ic. in particular, the following relations

(|t(v1,0))(z) = edi(v2

t(v1,v2) = t(v1,0)t(0,v2) ,
(|t(0,v2))(z) = (z + v2) .
for r  ir2, the multiplication of t with the character r gives rise a representation, t r(= t r( ; d)),
of lg(d) on o( ic),
(|t r

v )(z) = e2id<v,r>(|tv)(z) = edi(v2

1  +2v1(z+v2)+2<v,r>)(z + v1 + v2) .

1  +2v1z)(z + v1 ) ,

 = ttr, t r is equivalent to t with the interwining operator tr. for d  ir, r  ir2 and

by trt r
  o( ic  ih), we shall denote

|t r(= |t r(d)) := (,  )|t r( ; d)  o( ic  ih) .

(1)

the theory of theta functions is related to the case of d = 1. recall the theta function is an element
in o( ic  ih) with the innite product representation,

(z,  ) =

(1 + 2qn 1

2 cos 2z + q2n1)(1  qn) ,

im( )  0 .

yn=1

the theta function r(z,  ) with characteristics r = (a, b)  ir2 is dened by 2
(z,  )  ic  ih .

r(z,  ) := ei(a2 +2a(z+b))(z + a + b,  ),

for a xed  , (z,  ) ( r(z,  ) ) is the only -invariant entire function on ic, (up to a scalar
multiple), for the action, t (1) ( t r(1) resp.) . in fact, one has the following summation expression
of theta functions,

(z,  ) = (1|p
r(z,  ) = ((1|t r

m= t(m,0)(1))(z,  )
r (1))|p

m= t r

=p
(m,0)(1))(z,  ) =p

m= ei(m2 +2mz) ,
m= ei((m+a)2 +2(m+a)(z+b)) ,

where 1 is the function with constant value one. associated to each type of theta functions, we
dene the function,

(z,  ) =

(z,  )
( )3

, r(z,  ) =

r(z,  )
( )3  o( ic  ih) ,

where ( ) (= q1/24q

n=1(1  qn)) is the dedekind eta function. one has the relation,

(a,b)(z,  ) = ei(a2 +2a(z+))(z + a + b,  ),

(z,  )  ic  ih .

2here we write the theta function (a,b) instead of [

] in usual literatures.

corresponding to the jacobi theta function 1(z,  ) (:= ( 1

1(z,  ) := ( 1

2 , 1

2 )(z,  ) ,

whose z-expansion near z = 0 is given by,

by the theory of theta functions, the quasi-periodicity and zero relations hold for (a,b)(z,  ),

1(z,  ) = 2z + o(z2)

as z  0 .

(a,b)(z + 1,  ) = e2ia(a,b)(z,  ), (a,b)(z + ,  ) = ei( +2(z+b))(a,b)(z,  ),
(a,b)(z,  ) = 0  z  ( 1

(mod. zz + zz) .

2  b)

one has

(a+1,b)(z,  ) = (a,b)(z,  ) , (a,b+1)(z,  ) = e2ia(a,b)(z,  ) ,
(a,b)(z,  ) = e2ia(1a,1b)(z,  ) ,
(a+a,b+b)(z,  ) = ei(a2 +2a(z+b+b))(a,b)(z + a + b,  ) .

on the modular part, for each w  1
o( ic  ih),

2 zz, d  ir, there associates a representation of sl2(ir) on

(= (w, d)) : o( ic  ih)  sl2(ir)  o( ic  ih) ,

the relation between elliptic and modular actions is given by the following lemma.

lemma 1. for d  ir, w  1
with v = vm , the following relation holds:

2 zz, let t r = t r(d),  = (w, d). for m  sl2(ir) and v, v  ir2

edi(v1v2+2<v,r>)(|m )|t r

v = edi(v

2+2<v,r>)(|t r
1v

v)|m ,

for   o( ic  ih) .

proof. using the denition of t r, one can see that the result for t r follows easily from that for
r = 0. so we may assume r = 0. we have, v1 = v
2d. by computation, one
has the following relations:

2c, v2 = v

1b + v

1a + v

(c + d)w((|tv )|m )(z,  ) = edi( cz2

then the result follows from the equality, v1v2  v
by the above lemma, the geometric action of ir2  sl2(ir) on ic  ih can not be lifted directly to
one on o( ic ih). instead, in terms of (1) and (5), it denes an action of the semi-product of lg(d)
 sl2(ir), on o( ic  ih), where the conjugation of m  sl2(ir)
and sl2(ir), denoted by lg(d)
on lg(d) in the group lg(d)

here v, v  ir2  lg(d), with v = vm 1. the group lg(d)

 sl2(ir) is a central extension of

r

proposition 1.
o( ic  ih), and m( ic  ih),

the relations, (1) , (5), give rise the representation of

for the rest of this section, we shall only consider the case, d  zz, and discuss the situation when
the representation (7) does decend to a certain arithematic subgroup of ir2 sl2(ir). let  be the
modular group in sl2(ir),  = sl2(zz). the subgroup    of ir2  sl2(ir) is called the jacobi
group, denoted by j. in general, the jacobi group associated to a subgroup  of  is dened by
j :=   . we shall denote u, v, t, s, the following generators of j,
0 1 ! , s =  0

u = (1, 0), v = (0, 1)  zz2 , t =  1 1

1 0 !  .

in fact, j is characterized as the group generated by 4 elements, u, v, t, s, with the relations,

uv = vu ,
t1ut = qv , t1ut = v , s1us = v , s1vs = u1 .

s2t = ts2 ,

s4 = 1 ,

one can easily see that a character  of j must be trivial on the subgroup , hence determined
only by the values of (t), (s). other than , the other modular groups with which we will
concern in this paper are q, q = (q1, q2)  iq2, dened by

q := {m   | qm  q  } (= {m   | e2i<vm v,q> = 1  v  }) .

note that q depends only on the class of q in iq2/. the modular subgroup of  generated by the
elements, s , t2, is ( 1

(|m (w, d))|t r

vm (d) = (|t r

v (d))|m (w, d) ,

for   o( ic  ih) .

proof. since (1)(m+1)(n+1) does not change under the action of  for (m, n)  , it follows the
above equality for r = ( 1

for simplicity, we shall write |v, |m for |t r
v (d)), |m (w, d)) in the case of d  zz if no confusion
could arise. by proposition 2, one obtains an action of jq on o( ic  ih), called the weight w and

similarly, with the representation space m( ic  ih), one can dene the weight w , index d

4the unitary hwm of n = 2 superconformal were analysed by several groups of physicists, here we adhere to

papers [1] [3] [11] and references therein, for their mostly suitable formulation to our treatment.

by (13) (4), we have

l,m(z,  ) =

k ,0)(z, k )

we obtain the expression of nsl,m(z,  ), hence ch(a,b)
of the denominator in the expression of ch(a,b)

l,m (z,  ) are given by

l,m (z,  ) by the last relation of (4). the zeros

z  (i + a) +

1
2  b , (j + a) +

1
2  b

(mod. zzk + zz) .

by 0 < i  j < k, no common solution exists for the above two equations. hence the zeros of
the denominator for ch(a,b)
l,m (z,  ) are all simple; so are zeros of (a,b)(z,  ) in the numerator of the
expression. hence ch(a,b)

l,m (z,  )  o( ic  ih). 
using the last relation of (4) for (a, b) = ( 1
2 , 1

rl,m(z,  ) = iqh+

one obtains the following relations of ramon characters, which will be useful for the discussion of
topological applications of conformal algebra.

corollary 1.5

rl,m(z,  ) = erl,m(z,  ) ,
rl,m(z,  ) = eci( 2z+1)rl,m(z    1,  ) ,
rl,m(z,  ) = eci( +2z+1)rl,m(z    1,  ) ,
rl,m(0,  ) =( (1)ql,m+ c
erl,m(0,  ) =( (1)ql,m+ c

otherwise .

if m = l, i.e. antichiral ,
otherwise,

erl,m(z,  ) = rl,m(z,  ),
erl,m(z,  ) = eci( +2z+1)erl,m(z +  + 1,  ) ,
erl,m(z,  ) = eci( 2z+1)erl,m(z +  + 1,  ) ,

by a similar discussion, one can obtain the 1-expression of the other ramaon characters:

.

5 in the paper [12], the signs in the formula of er on pp. 373 were inaccurate in order to keep the statement of
proposition 4 there to be valid. the correct one should be er(z,  ) = n s(z 
then the statement of lemma 4 holds for r, dened in the present paper, instead of er.

by (3) (4), and theorem 1, one has the following result.

corollary 2. the following relations hold for characters of hwm for a xed central element 3c:

e2iql,mch(a,b)

l,m (z,  ) = e2ciach(a,b)

l,m (z + 1,  ) , ch(a,b)

l,m2(z,  ) = eci( +2(z+b))ch(a,b)

l,m (z + ,  ) .



in the study of hwm with a xed c, it is more convenient to extend the domain of (l, m) to the
following larger one:

lc := {(l, m)  zz2 | 0  l  k  2, l  m (mod 2)} ( {(i, j)  (
dene the automorphism of lc,

1
2

+ zz)2 | 0 < i + j < k} ) .

r : lc  lc ,

(l, m) 7 (k  l, m + k + 2) ( (i, j) 7 (j, i)  (0, k) ).

let bc be the collection of < r >-orbits , and vc the hilbert space with bc as an orthonormal basis,

bc = lc/ < r > ,

vc = bc ic .

a fundmental region for bc consists of those (l, m) with |m|  l, i.e., the index set of hwm.

m

one can dene the quantities, hl,m, ql,m, nsl,m(z,  ), ch(a,b)
l,m (z,  ), rl,m(z,  ),erl,m(z,  ), for an ele-
ment (l, m) in lc by the same formulas in (12) (13), (14), (15). the chirality of (l, m) becomes;

chiral  e2i(h(l,m)

q(l,m)

2

) = 1 ,

antichiral  e2i(h(l,m)+

q(l,m)

2

) = 1

11

it is easy to see that the characters and chirality thus dened are invariant under the automorphism
r, i.e., depending only on the class of (l, m) in bc, which will be denoted by [l, m]. we denote

ch(a,b)



(z,  ) := ch(a,b)

l,m (z,  ) , for  = [l, m]  bc ,

so are ns(z,  ), r(z,  ),er(z,  ). consider the following automophisms of lc,

f0 : (l, m) 7 (l, m  2)
n0 : (l, m) 7 (l,m)

( (i, j) 7 (i + 1, j + 1) )
( (i, j) 7 (j,i) ) .

by f0r = rf0, n0r = r1n0, they induce automorphisms of bc, hence the isomorphisms f, n, of vc ,
which are of order k, 2 respectively,

f : vc  vc ,
n : vc  vc ,

[l, m]  bc
[l, m]  bc

7 [l, m  2]  bc ,
7 [l,m]  bc .

(16)

we shall call f the spectral ow tranformation , n the charge conjuation of vc. by corollary 1 of
theorem 1, one has the inversion property of ramon characaters:
rn()(z,  ) = er(z,  ),
r(z,  ) = eci( 2z+1)rn()(z    1,  ),
rn()(z,  ) = eci( +2z+1)r(z    1,  ),

ern()(z,  ) = r(z,  ),
er(z,  ) = eci( +2z+1)ern()(z +  + 1,  )
ern()(z,  ) = eci( 2z+1)er(z +  + 1,  )

the relations in corollary 2 of theorem 1 describe the foolowing elliptic properties of ch(a,b)
for   bc:

(z,  )

(17)



eci( +2(z+b))ch(a,b)



(z + ,  ) = ch(a,b)

f() (z,  ) , e2ciach(a,b)



(z + 1,  ) = e2iqch(a,b)



(z,  ) ,

in particular, for neveu-schwarz and ramon characters, one has

(18)

(19)

eci( +2z)ns(z + ,  ) = nsf()(z,  ) , ns(z + 1,  ) = e2iqch(a,b)
eci( +2z+1)r(z + ,  ) = rf()(z,  ),

(z,  ) ,
ecir(z + 1,  ) = e2iqr(z,  ) ,



eci( +2z1)er(z + ,  ) = erf()(z,  ) ,

ecier(z + 1,  ) = e2iqer(z,  ) .

4 ellipticity and modularity of superconformal algebra repre-

sentations

in this section, we are going to discuss the symmetry properties of the collection of all unitary
irreducible hwm sca-modules for a xed central element c = k2
k . first we describe a convention,
will will facilitate the presentation signicantly. for a positive integer n , a vector v in the hilbert
space icn will be identied with a sequence of complex numbers, (vm)mzz, with vn = vm if n  m
(mod n ). the standard basis of icn are denoted by |n >, n  zz with |n >= |m > if n  m
(mod n ). the linear automorphisms, vn , un , u

vn|n >= n|n > , un|n >= |n + 1 > , u

n (  ic), of icn are dened as follows:
n|n >=( |n + 1 > if n  0 (mod n ) ,

|n + 1 > otherwise ,

where  is a primitive n -th root of unity, which will be specied later.

for a given r = (a, b), by identifying a basis element  of vc with the character ch(a,b)

(z,  ),
the elliptic relation (18) gives rise a representation of (c) on vc. since the action is trivial on the



12

abelian subgroup k of (c) generated by (k, 0) and (0, k), the representation indeed decends to
the nite quotient group, (c) := (c)/k,

vc  (c)  vc .

(20)

associated to c, we dene a pair of integers, n, m , as follows:

(n, m )(= (n (c), m (c)) =( (k, k1
2 )

lemma 2. the (c)-module vc is a direct sum of m irreducible sub-representations as follows,

vc =( m icn

(1,1)

l,=1 m, icn

(,)

for k  1 (mod 2),
for k  0 (mod 2),

where the multiplicities m, are dened by

( m, = k2

for k

2  0 (mod 2) .

proof. the map f of (16) acts on the basis bc of vc with the < f >-orbit decomposition,

bc =

[ k2

dene vc, = bc, ic. then vc is the direct sum of (c)-representaions, vc,, which are k-

dimensional vector spaces except dim.vc, k2
irreducible (c)-representation icn

(c)-module vc, is given by

then the result follows immediately.

we shall make an identication of icm  icn with the hilbert space vc through a canonical cor-
respondence of basis elements. for odd k, the identication is made by the following relations of
basis elements for 0   < m, n  zz,

| > |n >=( [,2n]
[, k  2n]

for even ,
for odd .

(22)

for even k, icm = ,=1 icm, . denote the standard base of icm, by | >, for 0   < m,.
the identication is given by the following relations,
2 ([2,2n] + [2,2n  k]),
2 ([2,2n]  [2,2n  k]),
2 ([2 + 1, 1  2n] + [2 + 1, 1  2n  k]),

for 0   < m1,1
for 0   < m1,1,
for 0   < m1,1
for 0   < m1,1,

(23)

note that by ( k2

2 , m) = ( k2

2 , m + k), one has the following expressions of vectors,

| >1,1 |n > = [2,2n],
| >1,1 |n > = [2 + 1, 1  2n],

for  = m1,1  1, k
for  = m1,1  1, k

2  1
2  0

(mod 2),
(mod 2)

as an example, for k = 4, the above identication becomes,

|0 >1,1 |0 >= 1
|0 >1,1 |0 >= 1
|0 >1,1 |0 >= [1, 1],

2 [0, 0] + [0,4],
2 ([0, 0]  [0,4]),

|0 >1,1 |1 >= 1
|0 >1,1 |1 >= 1
|0 >1,1 |1 >= [1,1].

2 ([0,2] + [0,6]),
2 ([0,2]  [0,6]),

by (18), one obtains the following results.

proposition 3. with vc = icm  icn via (22), (23), the (c)-action (20) induces by characters
ch(a,b)

(z,  ) has the following matrix representations:

(i) for odd k, q 7 id  v1
(ii) for even k, one has the (c)-decompostion, icm  icn = ,=1( icm,  icn ), with the

n , p 7 id  un .

for the modular property of ch(a,b)
(z,  ), we are going to see that it will be described by (5) for
d = c, w = 0 when restricting on the modular subgroup q, q = ( 1
2  b). together with
the elliptic action (20), the collection of ch(a,b)
(z,  ) gives rise a nite dimensional representation
of (c)
 q,
is obtained through the following exact sequence by the q-conjugation invariant property of the
subgroup k of (c),

 q via (7) with r = (a, b), d = c, w = 0. here the semi-product group, (c)

in particular, the group q is the modular group  for r or er, and ( 1
2 , 1

2 ) for ns. in this paper,
we shall only consider these two special cases due to the easy description of generartors of these
modular groups. we denote

 q  (c)

 q  (c)

w
2 )(c) := (c)  ( 1
2 , 1

( 1

, w(c) := (c)

( 1

  .

14

by (21) (6), w(c) is the group generated by p, q, t, s, with the relations:

pk = qk = s4 = 1 , pq = 1qp , s2t = ts2
t1pt = pq ,

t1qt = q ,

s1ps = 1q , s1qs = p1 .

( := e2ic)

we now describe the t, s-transforms of characters.

proposition 4. the following relations hold:

ns(z,  + 2) = e4i(h c
8 )ns(z,  ) , e
q
r(z,  + 1) = e2i(h+
2 )r(z,  ) ,

 are dened by

proof. the t-relations of r,er follows from (15) and (9). by using (10) for (a, b) = ( 1

2 ), and
t-relations of ramon characters, one obtains the t2-relation of ns. the s-transform of ns was
known in physics literatures (e.g., formula (28a) of [11]), the result we adopt here. then, by (10),
we have the equality,

setting (a, b) = ( 1
ramon characters by (11), (19). 

2 ) or ( 1

2 , 1

2 , 1

2 ) in the above, one obtains the expression of the s-transform of

by (20), proposition 4, and the remark of propostion 2, the identication of  with the characters,

ns : vc  w
2 )(c)  vc ,
2 , 1
( 1

ns or r,er, gives rise the following action for a neveu-schwarz or ramon sector,
r, er : vc  w(c)  vc .
with vc = icm  icn via (22) (23), the matrix presentation of the above actions on the part (c)
is described by proposition 3. a modular transformation will send one (c)-irreducible subspace
onto another one. hence we shall see that the matrix representation of a modula transformation
is a tensor product of one from icm -part, ( ), , with another one from icn , (nn)n,n. by
proposition 4, the t-transformation is a diagonal matrix; while the s-transformation of one vector
is a linear combination involving all the basis elements. the explicit forms will be given in the
following theorem, where the indices ,  , n, n of the matrices are non-negative integers less that
the dimension of the vector space involved in the expression,.

are given as follows:

s(| >1,1 |n >) = 4
hence we obtain the matrices of s for ns. by proposition 4, the expression of s for a ramon
sector diers from that of the neveu-schwarz sector only by a factor of e2i(q+ c

5 appendix: geometrical realization of n=2 conformal algebra

the geometrical representation of generators of virosoro algebra in terms of vector elds on ic
has been well-known in literatures, so is the n=1 conformal algebras generators as derivations of
ic with one grassmann variable , (see for instance [2]). the super-vector elds expressions of
n-extended conformal algebra for a general n have been treated in a similar way, and its various
forms could be found in physical literatures [7]. in this section, we are going to present a detailed
geometrical realization of the n=2 conformal algebra so that one could have a better understanding
of the symmetries represented by this algebra. we start with an alternative denition of the n=2
conformal algebra, whose formulation works also for an arbitrary value n,

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n + c
[lm, gj
[lm, jn] = njm+n ,
{gj

2  p)gj
q} = 2j,klp+q + ij,k(p  q)jp+q + c

12 (m3  m)m+n,0 ,
p] = ( m
m+p ,

p, gk

4 )j,kp+q,0 ,

[jm, jn] = c
[jm, gj

3 mm+n,0 ,
m+p ,

p] = ij,kgk

where j, k = 1, 2, and j,k are antisymmetric with 1,2 = 1. the denition of sca in sect.3 is related
to the above one by the relations,

g+

n =

1
2

(g1

n + ig2

n) , g

n =

1
2

it is easy to see that the correspondence,

(g1

n  ig2

n) ,

ln 7 (1)n+1ln , jn 7 (1)njn , g

p 7 (1)p 1

p ,

together with c 7 c, give rise an automorphism of the superalgebra sca. there is a nite
dimensional lie-superalgebra g invariant under the above automorphism with the even part ge and
odd part go given by

ge =< l1, l0, l1, j0 > ic  sl2  icj0 ,
, g
go =< g1

here the basis elements, e, f, h, of sl2 are expressed by

e = l1 , h = 2l0 , f = l1 ,

with the relations, [h, e] = 2e, [h, f ] = 2f, [e, f ] = h. the representaion of the even algebra ge on
the odd space go decomposes into two copies of the canonical 2-dimensional representation of sl2:

[h, g

1
2

] = g

2

,

[e, g

] = 0 , [e, g

[f, g

] = g

,

[f, g

] = 0 ,

for  = 1, 2, or ; while the action of j0 is given by
p , or

p] = ij,kgk

[j0, gj

[j0, g

p ] = g
p .

the product of odd geneartors are given by the following relation:

{gj

in conformal eld theory, the operators f, h
, j0 are called the momentum, dilation,
special-conformal, supersymmetry, s-supersymmetry, and so(2)-charge generators. let ic1,2 be
the one dimensional superspace with coordinates, t  ic, and the two-component grassmann
variable,  = (1, 2). the sca with c = 0 can be representated by the following set of super-vector
elds on ic1,2,

2 , e, g

(25)

under the conformal transformation,

(t, ) 7 (t1,t1) ,  = (1, 2) ,

one has the relations,



t 7 t2 

t

+ tk 

k ,


j 7 t


j ,

which give rise the automorphism (24) of sca. let ip1,2 be the one-dimensional projective super-
space, which is the union of two ane spaces, u0, u, with the super-coordinates:

(t, )  ic1,2  u0 ,

(t, )  ic1,2  u .

19

the intersection, u0  u, consists of elements with t 6= 0, or t 6= 0, with the coordinate transfor-
mation

(t, ) = (t1,t1)  ic1,2 .

we shall denote vect(m ) the space of super-vector elds of a super-manifold m . then through
(25), one can regard ln, gj

p, jn as elements in vect(u0  u), and we have

ln
ln

(n  1), g
p
g
(n  1),
p

(p  1
2 ), jm (m  0)  vect(u0) ,
(p  1
jm (m  0)  vect(u)
2 ),

hence

g =< ln, jm, gj

p > ic vect(ip1,2) .

now one can clearly see the analogy of above description of n=2 conformal alegbra with the usual
virasoro interpretation of vector elds on 1-dimensional projective space ip1.
