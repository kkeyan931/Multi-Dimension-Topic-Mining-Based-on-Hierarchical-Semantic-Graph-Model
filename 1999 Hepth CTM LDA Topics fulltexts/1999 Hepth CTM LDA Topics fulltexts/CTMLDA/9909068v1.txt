abstract

we use logarithmic conformal eld theory techniques to describe recoil
eects in the scattering of two dirichlet branes in d dimensions.
in the
particular case that a d1 brane strikes a d3 brane perpendicularly, thereby
folding it, we nd that the recoil space-time is maximally symmetric, with
ads3  ed3 geometry. we comment on the possible applications of this
result to the study of transitions between dierent background metrics.

non-perturbative techniques have provided many new insights into the theory formerly
known as strings [1]. in particular, a rich variety of classical soliton solutions have been
found using the technology of dirichlet (d) branes [2]. these must be taken into account in
any study of possible ground states and the spectra of excitations. a crucial ingredient in
such a study is understanding the interactions between d branes and elementary closed-
string states, and with other d branes. in general, since recoil perturbs the classical d-brane
solutions, one might expect that such interactions, would involve departures from conformal
symmetry and criticality.

one example of this recoil phenomenon was given in [3], where the perturbation of a
d particle by interaction with a closed-string state in at space was considered.
in the
low-energy limit, where the closed-string energy e  md, the mass of the d particle, it
was shown that the background metric was perturbed to an anti-de-sitter (ads) form [4].
moreover, the perturbation was described by a logarithmic pair of world-sheet operators
corresponding to the position and velocity of the struck d brane, and it was shown that
momentum was conserved during the interaction and recoil process.

the purpose of this paper is to extend and generalize this previous discussion by con-
sidering a generic interaction between two extended d branes that do not have particle
interpretations. such constructions may be relevant in the context of viewing the observ-
able world as a d3 brane embedded in a higher-dimensional space-time, with the extra bulk
dimensions being transverse to the d3-brane coordinates [57].

remarkably, we nd just one case in which the recoil space has an ads geometry, namely
ads3, which arises when a macroscopic string (d1 brane) moving along some bulk direction
in space-time hits a dp brane perpendicular to the direction of motion, as shown in fig. 1.
this physical problem is analogous to a straight stick hitting a at sheet of paper, which
we would expect to fold after the impact. as in the closed-string/d-particle scattering case
considered previously, the d-brane/d-brane interaction is described by a logarithmic pair
of world-sheet operators. in this case, they do indeed describe folding of the struck d brane.
we are also able to demonstrate that momentum is conserved during the interaction, as in
the previous closed-string/d-particle scattering case.

there have been many previous studies of string theory on an ads3 background [8, 9],
which can be described using a critical conformal eld theory. our analysis opens the way
to studies of transitions between this and other string backgrounds. it conrms that such
transitions are described by non-conformal logarithmic eld theories. we also recall that
the boundary of the ads3 background is equivalent to an appropriate coset of the sl(2, r)
manifold that appears in the analysis of two-dimensional black holes in string theory [10].
perhaps the mathematical analysis presented here could be used as the basis for studies of
the formation of such black-hole backgrounds, much as transitions between dierent two-
dimensional string black holes have already been described in terms of logarithmic pairs of
world-sheet operators [11]. however, the study of such a possibility lies beyond the scope of
this article.

(b) indicates the angular decit that appears when the bulk direction along which the d1 brane was
moving is compactied to a circle.

we rst review the world-sheet formalism based on logarithmic operators that was de-
veloped in a series of papers [1113], for the mathematical description of the recoil of a
d brane when struck by a closed-string state or by another d brane. although closed-
string/d-brane scattering has been studied using this formalism, we are unaware of any
treatment of d-brane/d-brane scattering in the relevant literature so far. logarithmic con-
formal eld theory [14] lies on the border between nite conformal eld theories and general
renormalizable twodimensional quantum eld theories. it is the relevant tool [1113] for
this problem, because the recoil process involves a change of state (transition) in the string
background, and as such is not described by a conformal eld theory. this change of state
induced by the recoil process can be described a change in the model background, and
as such is a nonequilibrium process. this is reected [11, 13] in the logarithmic operator
algebra itself.

as discussed in references [1113] in the case of dbrane string solitons, their recoil after
interaction with a closed-string (graviton) state is characterized by a  model deformed by
a pair of logarithmic operators [14]:

c i

 = (x i),

di

 = x i(x i),

i  {0, . . . , 3}

(1)

dened on the boundary  of the string world sheet. here x i, i  {0, . . . , 3} obey neumann
boundary conditions on the string world sheet, and denote the brane coordinates. the
remaining yi, i  {4, . . . , 9} denote the transverse bulk directions. in the case of d particles,
which were examined in [1113], the index i takes the value 0 only, in which case the

3

operators (1) act as deformations of the conformal eld theory on the world sheet. the

operator uir nx id describes the movement of the d brane induced by the scattering,
where ui is its recoil velocity, and yir nx ic describes quantum uctuations in the initial
i +k2

position yi of the d particle. it has been shown rigorously [13] that the logarithmic conformal
algebra ensures energymomentum conservation during the recoil process: ui = sgs(k1
i ),
where k1(k2) is the momentum of the propagating closed string state before (after) the recoil,
and gs is the string coupling, which is assumed here to be weak enough to ensure that d
branes are very massive, with mass md = 1/(sgs), where s is the string length.

the correct specication of the logarithmic pair in equation (3) entails a regulating

parameter   0+, which appears inside the (t) operator:

(x i) = z d

.

in order to realize the logarithmic algebra between the operators c and d, one takes [12]:

2  ln[l/a]  ,

(2)

where l (a) are infrared (ultraviolet) worldsheet cutos. the recoil operators (3) are
slightly relevant, in the sense of the renormalization group for the worldsheet eld theory,
having small conformal dimensions  = 2/2. thus the  model perturbed by these
operators is not conformal for  6= 0, and the theory requires liouville dressing [11, 15,
16]. momentum conservation is assured when the liouville eld is identied with the time
variable.

in the case of dp branes, the pertinent deformations are slightly more complicated. as

discussed in [12], the deformations are given by

gd

 .

(3)

the 0i components of the two-index couplings g
ii,   {c, d} include the collective mo-
menta and coordinates of the d brane as in the dparticle case above, but now there are
additional couplings g
ii, i 6= 0, which describe the folding of the d brane. such a folding
may be caused by scattering with another macroscopic object, namely another d brane,
propagating in a transverse direction, as shown schematically in fig. 1 for the case of a d1
brane hitting a d3 brane. this situation is the most interesting to us, since it generates an
ads3 space, as we show below. for symmetry reasons, in the situation depicted in fig. 1,
the folding of the d3 brane occurs symmetrically around the axis of the d1 brane. in this
case, the precise logarithmic operator deformations shown in (3), which pertain only to the
spatial region yi > 0 for the dirichlet coordinates, should be supplemented with their coun-
terparts for the yi < 0 region as well. this would, in principle, require additional (yi)
factors, which would complicate the analysis without introducing any new points of princi-
ple. therefore, for simplicity, we restrict ourselves here to the yi > 0 patch of space-time,
away from the hypersurface yi = 0. this will be implicit in what follows.

the folding couplings gd

ii  gii, i  {0, . . . , p}, i  {p + 1, . . . , 9}, are relevant couplings

with worldsheet renormalizationgroup  functions of the form

gi i =

gii =

gii,

t  2 .

(4)

this implies that one may construct an exactly marginal set of couplings gii by redening

gii

.

(5)

the renormalized couplings g0i were shown in [13] to play the role of the physical recoil
velocity of the d brane, while the remaining gii, i 6= 0, describe the folding of the dp brane
for p 6= 0.

as discussed in [3, 11], the deformations (1) create a local distortion of the space-time
surrounding the recoiling folded d brane, which may be determined using the method of
liouville dressing. in [3, 11] we concentrated on describing the resulting space-time in the
case when a d particle, embedded in a d-dimensional space time, recoils after the scattering
of a closed string o the dparticle defect. to leading order in the recoil velocity ui of the d
particle, the resulting space-time was found, for times t  0 long after the scattering event
at t = 0, to be equivalent to a rindler wedge, with apparent acceleration ui [3], where 
is dened above (2). for times t < 0, the space-time is at minkowski 1.

we now discuss the generalization of this phenomenon to the case of single d-
brane/d-brane scattering. for deniteness, we rst consider the case where there are
yi, i = 1, . . . m transverse (bulk) dimensions (with dirichlet boundary conditions), and
x i, i = m + 1, . . . d  1 are longitudinal coordinates on the brane, which obey neumann
boundary conditions.
in this generic case, we consider the folding of the recoiling brane
along several directions, determined by couplings gii of appropriate logarithmic operators of
the form (3), and the recoil-velocity vector of the d brane along the ith bulk direction is
denoted by ui. as mentioned previously, we restrict ourselves for simplicity to the region of
space-time in which yi > 0.

the folding/recoil deformations of the dp brane (3) are relevant deformations, with
anomalous dimension 2/2, which disturbs the conformal invariance of the  model, and
restoration of conformal invariance requires liouville dressing [16]. to determine the eect
of such dressing on the space-time geometry, it is essential to write [11] the boundary recoil
deformations as a bulk world-sheet deformations

(6)

where the giz denote the renormalized folding/recoil couplings (5), in the sense discussed
in [13]. as we have already mentioned, such couplings are marginal on a at world sheet.
from now on, for notational simplicity, we rename gii  gii. the operators (6) are marginal

1there is hence a discontinuity at t = 0, which leads to particle production and decoherence for
a low-energy spectator eld theory observer who performs local scattering experiments long after
the scattering, and far away from the location of the collision of the closed string with the d
particle [3].

also on a curved world sheet, provided [16] one liouville-dresses the (bulk) integrand by
multiplying it by a factor ei i, where  is the liouville eld and ii is the gravitational
conformal dimension, which is related to the at-world-sheet anomalous dimension 2/2 of
the recoil operator, viewed as a bulk world-sheet deformation, as follows [16]:

we next remark that, as the analysis of [11] indicates, the x i-dependent eld operators
(x i) scale as follows with : (x i)  ex i
(x i), where (x i) is a heavyside step
function without any eld content, evaluated in the limit   0+. the bulk deformations,
therefore, yield the following -model terms:

(8)

where the subscripts (0) denote world-sheet zero modes. upon the interpretation of the
liouville zero mode (0) as target time, the deformations (8) yield space-time metric defor-
mations in a -model sense, which were interpreted in [11] as expressing the distortion of
the space-time surrounding the recoiling d-brane soliton.

for clarity, we now drop the subscripts (0) for the rest of this paper, and we work in a
region of space-time on the d3 brane such that (  x i) is nite in the limit   0+. the
resulting space-time distortion is therefore described by the metric elements

g0i = (2yi + uit)(t) + giix i(x i) ,

i = 1, . . . , m, i = m + 1, . . . d  1

(9)

to leading order in gii. the presence of (t), (x i) functions and the fact that we are
working in the region yi > 0 indicate that the induced space-time is piecewise continuous 2.
in the general recoil/folding case considered in this article, the form of the resulting patch of
the surrounding space-time can be determined fully if one computes the associated curvature
tensors, along the lines of [3]. working to leading non-trivial order in the parameter , we
nd, after some tedious but straightforward calculations, the following non-zero components
of the riemann tensor (where i 6= j and i 6= j):

however, it is interesting to notice that the space is maximally symmetric, in the sense

of the curvature being given in terms of the metric tensor as:

rabcd = k (gacgbd  gadgbc)

(13)

only in the case that only one of the gii is non zero, e.g., gxz. this describes the situation
depicted in fig. 1: a d1 brane is moving along the z direction, perpendicular to a d3 brane
embedded in a d-dimensional space-time.
in this case, we obtain the form (13) for the
riemann tensor, with

k = 

2

xz.

(14)

the fact that the space is not in general maximally symmetric has been conrmed by a
detailed analysis of the general case, whose details we do not discuss here.

in the special d1/d3 case, the resulting space-time away from the hypersurface x = 0
looks, for t, yi > 0, like ads3  ed3, where ed3 is a at euclidean (d  3)-dimensional
space. string theory on ads3 has been the subject of many recent articles in the context of
critical string or dbrane theory [9]. much of the mathematical interest in string theories
formulated on such spaces lies in the fact that such spaces have a correspondence with well-
known group structures based on sl(2, r):
in particular, the boundary of the ads3 may
be formulated as an appropriate coset of sl(2, r). this is relevant to the study of many
physical problems, such as the quantum hall eect and high-energy scattering in qcd [17],
as well as the two-dimensional black hole [10]. it is interesting and suggestive that a patch
of the space-time found here resembles that structure. we also note that such a target
space-time corresponds to the electrovac solution of gauged supergravity [8], which can be
shown to leave space-time supersymmetry unbroken.

we conclude with some remarks about the metric (13), (14).

(i) if the folding is ignored: gxz = 0, the space-time resembles at minkowski space-time to
o(2) [3], upon making the following transformation for t > 0:

z = z +

1
2

uzt2,

t = t.

(15)

this implies that the space-time induced by the recoiling d brane resembles, for t  0 and
to order o(2), a rindler wedge space with acceleration uz. this space is well known
to produce a conical singularity when the time is compactied to a euclidean-signature
temperature, with decit angle

0z  2 (1  1/uz) .

(16)

such conical singularities break target space-time supersymmetry. however, this particular
conical singularity should be considered as a thermal property of the space. critical string
theory in rindler space is poorly understood at present, and the only case studied so far
concerns the situation in which the decit angle is quantized: 0z = 2(1  1
n ), where n
a positive integer, in which case the situation is equivalent to a string moving on a zn
orbifold [18] 3. this is obviously not the case in (16), given that our recoil/folding analysis

3even in this case, however, the perturbative superstring vacuum is known to be plagued with
tachyonic instabilities, indicating that a non-perturbative analysis is in order.

8

is valid for weakly-coupled string theory with gs  1, and hence very massive d branes that
move slowly: |ui|  1. the non-critical logarithmic conformal eld theory string approach
we advocate here may thus be of use in the generic study of strings in rindler spaces.

(ii) a simpler (but also interesting) case in which a conical singularity is generated is that in
which the cone is produced by the d3 brane folding alone, i.e., ignoring the recoil velocity
ui  0+. we look at the asymptotic structure of the distorted space-time obtained by such
a folding of the d brane along, say, the y axis, for x  0 and t  0, suppressing the recoil
contribution for simplicity. upon performing the time transformation t  t  1
2gxzxz, the
line element of the above-mentioned asymptotic space-time becomes:

ds2 = dt2 + dy2

 

1
2

gxz ,

 +(cid:0)1  2 z2(cid:1) dx 2 +(cid:0)1 + 2 x 2(cid:1) dz2  2 z dx dt ,

(17)

where y denotes collectively the remaining d  3 space-time coordinates. first of all, it is
immediate to observe that there is no angular decit for non-compact bulk dimension z. this
is in agreement with the maximally-symmetric ads3 structure, and is in agreement with the
above-mentioned fact that space-time supersymmetry is preserved by such space-times.

the situation changes drastically in case where the extra dimension z is compact, which
is the case assumed in [57]. for simplicity, we assume that z lies on a circle s1 of unit radius
(in appropriate string units, in which all the other distances are measured). for compact z
and at xed x  1/  0 and t  0, such that 2 x 2  g2
xz/4, we observe from the metric
(17) that there exists a decit angle in the circle around z:

  (g2

xz/4)

(18)

implying the dynamical formation of a conical-like singularity due to the d3brane folding
in this asymptotic region of the bulk space-time.

such singularities in general break bulk space-time supersymmetry [19]. however, in
view of the fact that the folded d brane is an excited state of the string/dbrane system,
the phenomenon should be viewed as a symmetry obstruction rather than a spontaneous
breaking of symmetry, in the sense that, although the ground state of the string/dbrane
system is supersymmetric, recoil produces a particular excited state that does not respect
that symmetry [20].

(iii) as mentioned earlier, logarithmic eld theory is the appropriate tool for discussing
transitions between dierent classical string vacua described by dierent conformal eld
theories. it has been shown previously, in the context of closed-string/d-particle scattering,
how one logarithmic pair of operators describes the transition between at space and an
ads space [3, 4], and how another logarithmic pair describes transitions between dierent
two-dimensional string black holes [11]. the logarithmic pair discussed here may open the
way to a description of the transition between at space and a two-dimensional black hole,
but pursuing that possibility lies beyond the scope of this paper.
