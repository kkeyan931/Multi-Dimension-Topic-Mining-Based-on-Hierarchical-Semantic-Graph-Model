abstract

it is shown that there are no nilpotent invariants in n = 4 analytic superspace for n  4 points.
it is argued that there is (at least) one such invariant for n = 5 points which is not invariant
under u (1)y . the consequences of these results are that the n = 2 and 3 point correlation
functions of the n = 4 gauge-invariant operators which correspond to kk multiplets in ads
supergravity are given exactly by their tree level expressions, the 4 point correlation functions
of such operators are invariant under u (1)y and correlation functions with n  4 points have
non-trivial dependence on the yang-mills coupling constant.

in a series of papers it has been suggested that it might be protable to study greens functions
of certain classes of gauge-invariant operators in four-dimensional superconformal eld theories
using superspaces which are specially adapted to the superconformal geometry of these classes
[1, 2]. the operators of interest are initially given as constrained superelds on minkowski
superspace, but by working in appropriately dened superspaces these constraints can be solved
explicitly in a rather simple and geometrically natural fashion [3]. the basic idea is to study
the greens functions of such operators using the superconformal ward identities considered as
dierential constraints on multiple products of these superspaces. for the case of n = 4 sym
there is a natural class of operators represented by analytic superelds. this class of operators,
for the gauge group su (nc), coincides with the operators which couple to the kaluza-klein
multiplets of iib supergravity on an ads5  s5 background [4] and is therefore of paramount
interest in the context of the maldacena conjecture relating iib supergravity on this background
to n = 4 superconformal eld theory [5].

a step towards nding the full consequences of the superconformal ward identities was taken
in reference [2] where superconformal invariants were studied. these invariants generalise the
usual cross-ratios which arise as ordinary conformal invariants. however, in a recent paper [6],
in which the possible implications of the additional u (1)y symmetry of iib supergravity for
n = 4 sym were discussed, intriligator observed that the non-nilpotent invariants constructed
in reference [2] are invariant under this u (1)y symmetry. he discovered that if one assumes
that the correlation functions themselves are invariant under this symmetry then one is led
to the extremely strong conclusion that they are all independent of the sym coupling gy m .
intriligators argument may be paraphrased as follows: part of the n = 4 yang-mills action is
not invariant under the u (1)y symmetry and hence dierentiating the action with respect to the
coupling constant results in this non-invariant term among others. as a result, dierentiating
any correlator, assumed to be u (1)y invariant, with respect to the coupling leads to a correlator
with the non-invariant term inserted as an additional operator. however, this new correlator is
not u (1)y invariant and so by assumption vanishes. it then follows that the original correlator
does not depend on the coupling constant. intrilligator then concluded that either a) the strong
conclusion could be right, b) the harmonic superspace formalism is awed, or c) there are more
invariants than those listed in [2].

possibility (a) can be ruled out since although this might be feasible for n  3 points it is
certainly not true for n  4 points as explicit calculations have shown [7, 8]. we shall comment
briey below on option (b), but the main point of this note is to argue that possibility (c) holds.
this is bound to be the case since the action contains a u (1)y non-invariant piece which will
lead to non-invariant vertices in the feynman rules and so to non-invariant greens functions.
in fact, we show that there is almost certainly a 5-point invariant whose leading term behaves
like 4, where the odd coordinates of analytic superspace are denoted , . the invariants given
in [2] all involve these variables in the combination . in n = 2 such a dependence of the
invariants on the odd coordinates is dictated by r-symmetry, but in n = 4 it is not because
the r-symmetry group is su (4) and not u (4). nevertheless, the z4 centre of su (4) does place
restrictions on the way that the odd variables appear in invariants. if e denotes the generator
of z4, where e4 = 1, one nds that   e whereas   e. as a result the odd variables can
only appear in combinations of the form pq where q = p mod 4 [1].

the existence of a 4 invariant for 5 points explicitly invalidates intriligators argument con-
cerning the non-dependence of the correlation functions on gy m for n  4 points. however, we
shall also show that there are no nilpotent invariants for n  4 points so that all possible 4 point
invariants are included correctly in [1]. thus we can apply intriligators construction to prove

1

the conjectured non-renormalisation theorem for n = 3 (and 2) points. the general form of the 3
point functions of analytic operators was given in [1] and discussed in more detail in [10]; it was
shown in [9] that the ads supergravity amplitudes and the appropriately normalised free sym
correlation functions agree and it was conjectured that this might be true for all values of the t
hooft coupling g2
y m nc and even for all nc. subsequently this was conrmed to rst non-trivial
order in perturbation theory [11]. moreover, there is an anomaly argument which establishes
the strong form of this conjecture for the correlator of three supercurrent multiplets [10] and an
alternative argument based on the adler-bardeen theorem [12, 13]. one of the main results of
this paper is that the strong conjecture holds for all 3 point functions of analytic operators.

of course it is still possible the option (b) holds, namely that the analytic harmonic superspace
formalism is in some way awed. one concern is that the underlying sym multiplet is on-shell,
and indeed it is true that the analyticity of the composite operators under consideration depends
on the eld equations of the underlying yang-mills elds being satised. a consequence of the
on-shell nature of the formalism is that it is almost impossible to check analyticity directly in
n = 4 perturbation theory. nevertheless, if one considers the n = 4 theory as an n = 2 theory
consisting of a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet, both transforming under the adjoint
representation of the gauge group, it is possible to carry out perturbative calculations in an
o-shell n = 2 harmonic superspace formalism and it has been veried that analyticity does
indeed hold for correlation functions of hypermultiplet composites in low orders in perturbation
theory [10, 7]. the present situation is therefore that analyticity in the n = 4 formalism should
be regarded as an assumption, but that it is supported by the checks in n = 2 perturbation
theory that have been carried out so far.

we briey recall the analytic superspace formalism. n = 4 analytic superspace m has coordi-
nates

x =   x  a
yaa !

a 

(1)

where each index can take on 2 values. the even coordinates x and y are coordinates for complex
spacetime and the internal space s(u (2)  u (2))\su (4) respectively. the odd coordinates 
and  number 8 in all, half the number of odd coordinates of n = 4 super minkowski space.
an innitesimal superconformal transformation takes the form

x = vx = b + ax + xd + xcx

where each of the parameter matrices is a (2|2)  (2|2) supermatrix and where

g =   a b

c d !  sl(4|4)

(2)

(3)

one can show that the central elements in the superalgebra sl(4|4) do not act on m so that one
really has an action of the superalgebra psl(4|4).

the gauge-invariant operators are aq = tr(w q) where w is the n = 4 sym eld strength tensor
which takes its values in the lie algebra su(nc) of the gauge group. these operators transform
as

where  = str(a + xc). a correlation function of such operators

aq = vaq + qaq

g(x1, . . . xn) =< aq1(x1) . . . aqn(xn) >

(4)

(5)

should satisfy the ward identity

n

(vi + qii)g = 0

(6)

xi=1

such a correlation function, if it does not vanish at zeroth order in the odd variables, can be
written in the form

where the prefactor is a function of the propagators

g = prefactor  f,

gij = sdetx 1

ij =

y2
ij
x2
ij

,

(7)

(8)

with xij = xi  xj and yij = yij  ijx1
ij ij, which absorbs the charges of the operators and
which is analytic in the internal bosonic coordinates. the function f is therefore a function of
superconformal invariants.

in [2] a large number of superinvariants was found, but, as pointed out in [6], they all depend on
the odd variables in the combination . they are thus invariant under p gl(4|4) and not just
p sl(4|4). to examine whether this list is complete or not we shall look for nilpotent invariants
using the supersymmetry ward identities in a straightforward manner. suppose f is a nilpotent
invariant, then f = fo+ higher order in , , where fo is itself nilpotent and has a xed power
of the odd variables. to rule out the existence of any such f for a given number of points it is
therefore sucient to show that all possible leading terms fo vanish. the superconformal ward
identities must hold order by order in powers of the odd variables  and  so that the action of
the ward identity on f0 at lowest order is obtained when the ward identity operator is linearised
appropriately with respect to  and . these truncated superconformal ward identities involve
the following simplied (linearised) superconformal killing vectors:

v  =

v   = x x   + x b

(11)

corresponding to translations, dilations and conformal boosts as well as three similar equations
with x and y interchanged. the linearised killing vectors for ordinary (q) supersymmetries and
special (s) supersymmetries are given respectively by

va =

v a  = x yaa

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

together with a similar set with  replaced by . the above superconformal killing vectors can
be read o from the full superconformal killing vectors given in [1]. the ward identity also
involves the quantity ; however, except for dilations and conformal boosts in x and y this term
vanishes when linearised.

3

translational symmetries of the form of (??) hold for all of the coordinates, so that we can
conclude immediately that an invariant can only depend on the dierences xij := xi  xj.

in order to solve equation (15) we change variables from the dierences ij to the variables

123 := x1

12 12  x1

23 23, 234 := x1

23 23  x1

34 34, . . .

and

x1
ii+1ii+1

c = xi

(16)

(17)

it is straightforward to verify that the variables of the rst equation are inert under the trans-
formation induced in equation (15) and so this equation implies that the f0 part of the greens
functions does not depend on c.

equation (14) can be solved in a similar manner. we introduce the variables

1234 := (x1

12 y12  x1

23 y23)1123  (x1

23 y23  x1

34 y34)1234, . . .

(18)

which are inert under the transformation induced by (14) and the nal variable which is the sum
of terms over all points of terms of this form. equation (14) then implies that f0 only depends
on 1243 . . ..

finally, we turn to equation (15) which is the most complicated supersymmetry transformation.
it implies that f0 depends on only 12345 where 12345 is given by

12345 = a1

12341234  a1

23452345, . . .

(19)

where a1234 is obtained by substituting in the supersymmetry ward identity of equation (15)
to bring it to the form

(cid:18)a1234



1234

+ a2345



2345(cid:19) fo = 0

(20)

explicitly

a1234 = (cid:16)y12z1

123x1

12 (x1 + x2)  y23z1

123x1

23 (x2 + x3)

+(y1 + y2)z1

123x1

12 x12  (y2 + y3)z1

123x1

23 x23(cid:17) (cid:16)same with (123)  (234)(cid:17) (21)

where

z123 := y12x1

12  y23x1
23

(22)

moreover it is possible to invert a1234 and thus obtain a rational expression for 12345. this
expression is rather complicated, however, so that we shall not give it here. we nd essentially
identical results with  replaced by  if we use the corresponding ward identities.

the conformal boost ward identity and a similar identity in the internal space are now auto-
matically satised as a result of taking the anti-commutators of the q and s supersymmetry
transformations leaving only the ward identities for spacetime and internal dilations. however,
these are easily solved and just determine the overall power of x and y respectively.

let us carry out a count of the spinor variables that a n point invariant or greens functions
can depend on. initially, an invariant depends on all the spinor coordinates i, i, i = 1, . . . n
that is 4n s and 4n s. the translational supersymmetries (13) imply that it can only depend
on dierences, that is, on the 4(n  1) ii+1s with a similar result for s. in a similar way,

4

equations (14), (15) and (15) imply that an invaraint can only really depend on 4(n  4) spinors
of equation (19) with a similar result for s. hence for greens functions with n  4 points
there are in eect no available spinors with which to form nilpotent invariants.

we now discuss in more detail these consequences of the superconformal ward identities for
greens functions with a small number of points. the simplest example is at 2 points. fo can
only depend on x12. then (??) implies in this case that

x 
12



a
12

fo = 0

(23)

and this in turn implies that fo cannot depend on 12, or, by a similar argument 12. hence
there can be no nilpotent 2 point invariants.

three-point correlation functions have been studied in [10]. if the sum of the charges, q = pi qi,

is even, the result is

< aq1aq2 aq3 >= cq1q2q3(g12)k1(g23)k2(g31)k3

(24)

where c is a constant and where

k1 =

k2 =

k3 =

1
2
1
2
1
2

(q1 + q2  q3)

(q2 + q3  q1)

(q3 + q1  q2)

(25)

(26)

(27)

this solution is unique up to the constant involved because there are no 3 point invariants. there
are clearly no non-nilpotent 3 point invariants because the leading term of such an invariant
would be either a 3 point spacetime invariant or a 3 point internal space invariant and there
are no such objects. to examine the existence of nilpotent invariants we use the above method.
this time (15) implies that fo can depend on 123 and a similar  variable, but (14) shows that
this dependence must be trivial. thus there are no 3 point invariants. an identical argument
can be used to show that the 3 point functions with odd total charge, and which consequently
vanish to leading order, must in fact vanish to all orders. without loss of generality we can take

such a 3 point function to be specied by charges q1, q2, q3 + 1, where pi qi is again even. it can

be written

< aq1aq2 aq3+1 >= (g12)k1(g23)k2(g31)k3 f

(28)

where f is nilpotent and satises

(vi) + 3)f = 0

(xi

(29)

however, since the 3 term vanishes for linear s and q supersymmetries we can immediately
deduce that f0 and therefore also f vanish.

for 4 points, equations (13) and (15) imply that the leading term, fo, of a putative nilpotent
invariant f depends only on the odd variables of equation (16) and a similar pair of  variables,
while (14) implies that fo should only depend on the 1234 spinor of equation (18) as well as a
similarly dened 1234. implementing nally the non-linear s supersymmetry (15) we nd that
this dependence is actually trivial, and so we conclude that there can be no nilpotent invariants
for 4 points. this means that the 4 point invariants are determined by their leading, purely
bosonic terms. these are conformal invariants in x and y, that is, cross-ratios of the x and

5

y dierences. there are two independent such variables in both sectors for 4 points and so 4
independent invariants altogether. they may be expressed in terms of the superinvariants given
in [2]; for example, one could take as a basis set two super cross ratios of the form

and 2 supertraces of the form

sdet x14 sdet x23
sdet x12 sdet x34

str (x 1

12 x23x 1

34 x41)

(30)

(31)

an important conclusion of this analysis is that the invariants listed in [2] are indeed complete
for 4 points, so that these invariants are in fact invariant under p gl(4|4) and not just p sl(4|4).

applying a similar argument to the 5 point case we nd that the leading term, fo, of a 5 point
nilpotent invariant can only depend on the odd variables 12345 of equation (19) and a similar
12345 variable at rst sight this expression seems to involve dependence on xi and not just the
dierences xij, but in fact this turns out not to be the case although 12345 as dened in (19) has
complicated x-dependent singularities in the yij which are not allowed in correlation functions.
however, these can be removed by simply multiplying through by the denominator, a procedure
which does not aect the supersymmetry analysis given above at this lowest order. although
the greens functions are not necessarily invariant under u (1)y they are invariant under z4 and
so the leading term of a ve-point nilpotent invariant can be of the form 4 or of the form 4.
from 12345 of (19) we can construct the leading term of a nilpotent 5 point invariant of the
form 4
ijs. the dilation ward
identity and a similar identity for the internal variable y imply that the dependence of f on
x and y is schematically of the form x2y2. although we have no proof at present that this
leading term can be extended to a full 5 point superinvariant it seems highly probable that such
an extension exists. we note, in particularly, that such an invariant is not u (1)y invariant as it
does not depend on the odd variables as a power series in .

12345f (x, y), for some appropriate function f of the x

ijs and the y

to obtain the consequences of the above results on nilpotent invariants we briey review intrili-
gators argument concerning the dependence of correlation functions on the coupling. to do this
in our formalism we rst note that the supercurrent t = tr(w 2) is also the (on-shell) lagrangian
mulitplet. in (real) minkowski superspace the supercurrent multiplet is tij,kl := tr(wijwkl)20,
where i, j = 1, . . . 4 now denote su (4) indices and where the subscript 20 indicates that the
real twenty-dimensional representation is to be projected out from the product by imposing the
condition ijkltij,kl = 0. reality means that

if we set

t ij,kl :=

1
4

ijmnklpqtmn,pq = t ij,kl

t ij,kl := t ik,jl + t jk,il

(32)

(33)

then t  is symmetric on both pairs of indices, symmetric under the interchange of the pairs and
vanishes on symmetrisation over any 3 indices. using t  we can form a complex superaction
[14]

where

s = z d4x dijdklt ij,kl

dij := did

j = dji

(34)

(35)

the invariance of s under supersymmetry follows from the constraints

dit jk,lm = 2(j

where

and

j,kl

(36)

(37)

(38)

these constraints are themselves a consequence of the constraints satised be the underlying
eld strength wij:

iwjk = [iwjk]

(39)

where i is the gauge-covariant spinorial derivative. it is straightforward to compute that

f being the self-dual part of the minkowski space yang-mills eld strength tensor.

s = z d4x (

ff  + . . .)

(40)

the analytic supercurrent t is related to tij,kl by means of the su (4) harmonic variables
(ur

i)  su (4), r = 1, 2, r = 3, 4.

i, ur

we can therefore rewrite the superaction as a harmonic superaction

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

and where du denotes the standard invariant measure on the coset s(u (2)u (2))\su (4). using
this formalism we may then write the on-shell action as

where  is the coupling

s = im(cid:18) z d t(cid:19)

(45)

(46)

note that, in terms of the odd variables ,  the measure d essentially contains the factor d4.

if we dierentiate a correlation function with respect to the coupling we get




< aq1 . . . aqn >z d < t aq1 . . . aqn >

for example, for a 3 point correlator we have




< aq2aq3aq4 > z d1 < t (1)aq2aq3aq4 >

7

(47)

(48)

where aq = (gy m )qaq. the dierentiation of the path integral expression for the correlation
function sees these explicit factors of gy m , but these terms are cancelled by a term arising from
the dierentiation of the action which counts the powers of elds in the operators. the residual
term from dierentiating the action is then the on-shell integrated action. now the integral on
the right projects out the (1)4 term in the 4 point correlator. since this correlator depends on
the odd variables only through  the result would have to have the form 4 a power series in
. however, the 3 point correlator also depends only on  and therefore has no such terms.
thus the integral is zero and we conclude that all 3 point correlators have trivial dependence
on the coupling.

such a conclusion will not hold for 4 point correlators, however, provided that the putative 5
point nilpotent invariant discussed above exists. the leading term of this invariant can be ex-
pressed in terms of the dierences 12, 13, 14, 15 and so gives a contribution of the integrand of
the form (1)4 which moreover has no s. therefore one cannot conclude that 4 point functions,
or indeed n point functions with n  4, should have trivial coupling constant dependence.

to conclude, we have shown that the conjectured non-renormalisation theorem for 2 and 3 point
correlation functions in n = 4 yang-mills theory holds exactly. this lends further support
to the maldacena conjecture to add to the results obtained using instanton techniques [15].
we have also shown that the 4 point invariants are correctly listed in [2], so that the 4 point
correlation functions of analytic operators are actually invariant under u (1)y . we have also
seen that it seems likely that there is a 5 point invariant whose leading term behaves like 4.
such an invariant would not be invariant under u (1)y and its existence would imply that n
point functions for n  4 do not depend trivially on the coupling.

note added in a recently posted paper [16] an argument for the 3-point non-renormalisation
theorem was given based on a conjecture concerning the behaviour of the ope. the authors of
this paper have suggested, on the basis that it leads to u (1)y invariant correlation functions,
that the analytic superspace method is awed. however, as we have shown above, there are now
good grounds to suppose that this will not be true for n  5 points. these authors also suggest
that the analytic superspace formalism is not capable of accommodating the long supermultiplets
of the theory. we believe that this is not the case; this point will be discussed further elsewhere.
