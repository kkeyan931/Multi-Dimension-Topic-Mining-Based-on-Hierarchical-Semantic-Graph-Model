abstract

by working with the free energy for the type ii supergravity near-horizon solution
of n coincident non-extremal dp-branes we study the transitions among the non-
conformal dp-brane system, the perturbative super yang-mills theory and a certain
system associated with m theory. we derive a relation between this free energy and
the action of a dp-brane probe in the n dp-brane background. constructing the
free energy for the ve dimensional black hole labeled by the d1-brane and d5-brane
charges we nd the similar relation between it and the action of a d1 or d5 brane
probe in the d1 + d5 brane background. these relations are explained by the massive
open strings stretched between the relevant d-branes.

recently an important and intriguing duality has been proposed by maldacena that
states the equivalence between the string/m theory compactied on the anti-de sitter space
(ads) and certain superconformal eld theory living on the boundary of the ads [1]. this
duality was suggested by the fact that the near-horizon geometries of typical brane con-
gurations such as d3-brane, m2-brane and m5-brane are given by the product spaces,
ads5  s5, ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 respectively. for the non-extremal n coincident d3-
branes the thermal gravitational action was constructed to give the free energy of the four
dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory with u(n) gauge symmety in the
limit of large n and strong t hooft coupling and further the leading correction in inverse
powers of the t hooft coupling was calculated [2, 3, 4]. the four dimensional sym free
energy was shown to be related with the supergravity interaction potential between the n
coincident d3-brane source and a d3-brane probe, which is derived by evaluating the eec-
tive dbi action of the d3-brane probe in the near-horizon d3-brane background [5]. the
supergravity interaction potential is interpreted as the contribution of the massive states to
the sym free energy in the higgs phase.

the conformal d3-brane system was extended to the n coincident non-conformal dp-
brane system where the dp-brane supergravity solution, that is obtained in the decoupling
limit, interpolates between the p + 1 dimensional perturbative sym theory and the dierent
limits of string/m theory [6]. for the theories on these dierent domains the entropies
were calculated and expressed in terms of the energy, the volume of the system and so on.
they were shown to match near the transition regions which are specied by the critical
energies [7]. recently combining the maldacena conjecture with the matrix theory the rich
structure of phase diagram for the various near-horizon d-brane systems has been explored
and described by the entropy and the volume of the system [8]. on the other hand the free
energy for the dp-brane supergravity solution was calculated [9, 10] and the eects of the
light spatial winding modes and the light temporal winding modes were investigated [11].
taking account of these stringy modication and hagedorn behavior the phase diagram was
constructed to be described by gsn and the temperature.

based on the free energy consideration we will show that the free energy of the n dp-
brane system becomes that of the p + 1 dimensional weakly-coupled sym theory near the
transition region specied by the critical temperature. near the strong coupling transition
region the dp-brane supergravity free energy will be shown to match onto the free energy of
the conformal eld theory (cft) description or the description associated with m theory.
from the alternative view point the free energy for the supergravity description will be
reproduced by integrating approximately the nite temperature partition function in the
canonical ensemble. we will compute the eective dbi action of a dp-brane probe in the
non-extremal dp-brane background and investigate how it is related with the dp-brane
supergravity free energy.

further we will consider a system of near-extremal q1 d1-branes and q5 d5-branes in
the iib string theory where the d5-branes are wrapped on t 4. the decoupling limit yields
the iib string theory on t 4  s3  ads3 which is dual to a certain two dimensional cft
[1]. the obtained six dimensional supergravity solution contains not only the d1-brane but
also a solitonic string which is produced by wrapping the d5-brane on t 4. compactifying
the string direction leads to a ve dimensional black hole. we will derive the free energy for

2

the ve dimensional near-horizon black hole specied by two charges only and construct the
action of a d1-brane or d5-brane probe in the q1 d1-brane and q5 d5-brane background.
combining them we will search for a relation between each thermal probe action and the
free energy of the d1 + d5 system.

let us begin to write down the string-frame metric and dilaton for n coincident non-

extremal dp-branes with toroidal topology s1  t p for xing the notation

and h is the schwarzschild-like harmonic function h = 1(r0/r)7p. the electric component

which is associated with the period  = 1/t of the euclidean time. by compactifying the

which implies the near-horizon limit for the dp-brane solution. in sym picture with gauge

with the mass of the extremal dp-brane medp = (7  p)8pvpl7p/16g. in ref. [11] the

in the limit r0  0 the manifold xbh becomes a blow-up throat of the extremal dp-brane

(14)

now we are ready to argue the transition between the supergravity description and the
perturbative sym description from the view point of the free energy. the free energy for
the supergravity solution is rewritten in terms of gsn and t as

f = (5  p)cn 2(gsn)

5p

.

(16)

for p = 3 the free energy reads f =  2
8 n 2t 4v3 [2, 3, 4]. at a given temperature t
which is related with the non-exremality parameter r0 = u0 through (13), the eective
dimensionless coupling constant in the corresponding u(n) sym theory is given by [6, 7]

g2
ef f  g2

y m nu p3

,

(17)

so that it depends on the temperature. since the supergravity description can be trusted in
the region gef f > 1, the transition region is characterized by gef f  1, that is

gsn  (t ls)3p.

(18)

we would like to see how the free energy behaves at the transition region. substituting the
relation (18) specifying a critical line in the (gsn, t ) plane into the supergravity free energy
(15) we have

f  n 2t p+1vp.

(19)

it should be noted that the ls dependence has been cancelled out. the obtained expression
shows the scaling of the free energy for the p+1 dimensional perturbative sym theory which
has n 2 degrees of freedom for the adjoint representation of u(n). since the perturbative
sym theory region gef f < 1 is expressed as

(g2

y m n)

1

3p < t ,

p < 3

t <

1

(g2

y m n)

1

p3

,

3 < p < 5

(20)

the perturbative sym theory gives the high temperature description for p < 3 and the low
temperature description for 3 < p < 5, when compared with the supergravity description.
using an interesting relation u0  gef f t , which is obtained from (17) and (13), we make the
free energy (14) change into a simple and suggestive form

f  (5  p)n 2gp3

ef f t p+1vp.

(21)

the free energy for the non-conformal dp-brane system for gef f > 1 is regarded as the
strongly-coupled free energy for the large n sym theory with the eective dimensionless
coupling constant gef f , which shows the planar behavior. it becomes the conformal one only
when p = 3. as seen above it reduces to (19) obviously near the transition region gef f  1.
here we consider the partition function in the canonical ensemble for the dp-brane sys-
tem. from the elimination of r0 between (11) and (8) with (13) the entropy can be expressed
in terms of the mass as

s = n g

(m  medp)

2(7p) ,

(22)

where the positive constant  includes a factor ( 1
9p)(9p)/2(7p). using the energy of dp-brane
above the extremality e = m  medp we see that the density of states for the near-horizon
dp-brane system grows like n(e)  es(e). the partition function given by

z = z 

0

deee/t n(e)

(23)

well converges when (9  p)/2(7  p) < 1, that is p < 5. it is interesting to note that a
critical behavior emerges at p = 5. in the integration the saddle point is estimated with a
positive constant  as

from which the partition function is approximately evaluated as

e0 = (9  p)(ng

we can observe that the free energy f = t log z reproduces the same expression as (15)
including a characteristic coecient (5p). for the peculiar p = 5 case the entropy is linearly
rising with energy which is similar to the dynamical string [12]. the free energy shows a
logarithmic singular behavior when the temperature is near the hagedorn temperature of

the eective string, th  1/gsnls.

alternatively we use a dierent parameter  accompanied with r0 to give

l7p = r7p

l7p =

sinh 2.

(26)

the extremal limit is given by r0  0,    with l7p xed. here we work on the
0 sinh2  with d = 7  p,
radial coordinate dened by the shift transformation rd = rd + rd
[13]. the event horizon at r = r0 and the curvature singularity at r = 0
used in ref.
are transformed into an outer event horizon specifed by r7p
cosh2  and an inner
horizon, r7p

thus we derive the generalized smarr formula for the mass of d dimensional charged black
hole and  can be regarded as the electric potential on the outer event horizon [14].

furthermore, we will return to analyze the free energy (15) for the dp-brane supergravity
solution in both the high and low temperature regions. first for the supergravity solution
carrying the d2-brane charge in the high temperature region the 2 + 1 dimensional pertur-
bative sym theory governs the dynamics while the low temperature region is described by
the n coincident m2-brane solution localized in the compact dimension in m theory, which
gives the cft with so(8) r-symmetry [15]. this phase transition takes place at u0  g2
[6] which gives a transition line gs  t lsn. from (15) the d2-brane supergravity free en-
ergy scales as f  n 5/3g1/3
line it turns out to be

s . by eliminating gs we see that on the transition

2 t 3v2.

(31)

in refs. [3, 4] the entropies of the non-dilatonic n coincident p-branes such as d3, m2 and
m5 branes were evaluated and each free energy was shown to be

f  n

p+1

2 t p+1vp,

(32)

which is that of the cft in p + 1 dimensions. the expression (31) is just the form charac-
teristic of the free energy for the 2 + 1 dimensional cft. this conformal behavior is also
seen directly from (21) since the low temperature phase transition is specied by g2
ef f  n,
which is compared with the high temperature transition line gef f  1.
for the n coincident d4-branes the supergravity description is replaced by the sym
theory in the low temperature region. the high temperature region is described by the n
coincident m5-branes wrapped on the eleventh dimensional circle with radius r11 = gsls
y m u0 > n 1/3 [6] corresponds to the high
in m theory. the wrapped m5-brane region g2
temperature region t > 1/(gslsn 1/3). the supergravity free energy f = cn 3gst 6v4ls
with c = 27374 for the d4-branes in (15) becomes

f  n

8

3 t 5v4

(33)

on the transition line. on the other hand corresponding to (32) with p = 5 the 5 + 1
dimensional conformal system on the n coincident m5-brane world-volume has a free energy
f = 26373n 3t 6v5 [3, 4]. so the free energy of the wrapped m5-brane is estimated as
cn 3t 6v4gsls, since its volume is v5 = v42r11. from this side the free energy on the
transition line becomes (33) as well. thus the n coincident d4-branes as well as the n
coincident wrapped m5-branes provide the same free energy expression, which covers the
whole gef f > 1 region.

the n coincident d1-brane system whose high temperature region is described by the
two dimensional perturbative sym theory, is also replaced by a two dimensional free orb-
ifold cft [16] in the low temperature region. the orbifold cft region is characterized
s . the free energy (15) with p = 1 is given by

by u0 < gy m [6], that is, t < qgs/nl1
f  n 3/2g1/2

t 3v1ls , which becomes

s

f  nt 2v1

7

(34)

along the low temperature transition line specied by gs  (t ls)2n.
its expression just
shows the scaling of the free energy for the two dimensional cft, eq.(32) with p = 1. this
conformal structure also emerges from (21) on the transition region specied by g2
ef f  n.
thus in the canonical ensemble we have demonstrated the matching of the free energies near
the transition line with the temperatures of both sides equally xed, which is compared with
the entropy matching with the energies of both sides equally xed that was performed in
ref. [7] from the view point of microcanonical ensemble.

we further proceed to the n coincident d0-brane system which in the low temperature
region is replaced by the matrix black hole system in eleven dimensions. the matrix black
hole region is specied by u0 < g2/3
s . the
free energy for the d0-brane solution scales as f  n 7/5g3/5
s . the substitution
of gs  (t n 2/9ls)3 yields a simple scaling form of the free energy

y m n 1/9 [6], that is translated into t < g1/3

s n 2/9l1

(t ls)14/5l1

s

f  nt

(35)

along the critical line. therefore, the corresponding entropy is just given by s  n. in ref.
[17], the matching of mass-entropy scaling between the matrix theory compactied on t d
and the schwarzschild black hole in (11  d) dimensions was exhibited by setting s  n.
our result corresponds to the d = 0 case. this matrix theory behavior arises directly from
(21) since the critical line is again expressed as g2

we now turn our attention to a system that a single dp-brane probe is separated by a
distance r from n coincident non-extremal dp-branes (source). the world-volume action of
a dp-brane probe in the dp-brane background is given by

ef f  n.

i = tpz dp+1eqdet gx x   tpz c (p+1),

(36)

where c (p+1) represents the rr (p + 1)-form potential that couples to the dp-brane charge
and ,  = 0,    , 9 and tp is the dp-brane tension tp = 1/(2)plp+1
gs. the dp-brane probe
will be considered to be static and parallel to the source. choosing a static gauge and
substituting the background solution (1)  (4) into (36) we have an eective action of a
dp-brane probe at a position r

s

i = tpvph 1(h  1 + h0  h),

(37)

where vp is the volume of the spatial directions along the dp-brane.
in the eld theory
limit (9) that also means l  r0, l  r, the free energy fpr = i/ of the dp-brane probe
becomes

fpr = tpvp(cid:18) r

l(cid:19)7p(cid:18)r1  (

r0
r

)7p  1(cid:19) .

(38)

the expansion in r0/r leads to the supergravity interaction potential between a dp-brane
in terms of the two parameters with energy dimension,
probe and the dp-brane source.
m = (r5p/l7p)1/2 and t = (r5p
0 /l7p)1/2(7  p)/4, which are in a similar form, the free
energy is expressed as

fpr = tpvp(ml)

5p  s1  (

2(7p)

5p  1! .

(39)

here we consider the long distance region r  r0 where a dp-brane probe is far away from
the source. under the corresponding low temperature expansion in t /m of (39) the leading
term is computed by

fpr = (7  p)cn(gsn)

p3

5p (t ls)

2(7p)

5p vplp1

s

(40)

with c dened in (16). let us denote the free energy for the n coincident dp-branes (15)
by f (n). in the large n limit we can nd a relation

fpr  f (n + 1)  f (n).

(41)

in the n + 1 dp-brane system one dp-brane is far away from n others. subtracting the
free energy for the n coincident dp-branes (source) from that for the whole n + 1 dp-brane
system we can extract the free energy for the single dp-brane probe in the n dp-brane
background. the presence of the dp-brane probe at a distance r from the n dp-brane source
gives an expectation value u = r/ to the higgs eld and leads to the gauge symmetry
breaking u(n + 1)  u(n)u(1). the mass of an open string stretched between the probe
and the source is given by u/2. in this picture f (n) in (41), the free energy of the n
coincident dp-branes (source) is considered to be given by the massless constribution only.
therefore the probe free energy in (41) can be interpreted as the contribution of the massive
open strings in the supergravity side, or alternatively, the contribution of massive sym
modes. the derivation of (41) on the other hand supports the existence of the characteristic
coecient (5  p) in the free energy expression (15) for the near-horizon dp-brane system.
here we consider a system of q5 d5-branes and q1 d1-branes in the iib string theory
compactied on t 4. the d1-brane is parallel to the instanton string in six dimensions arising
from the d5-brane wrapped around t 4. the low energy dynamics of this system is described
by the higgs branch of two dimensional u(q1)  u(q5) sym gauge theory. the ir limit of
it is given by the two dimensional (4,4) super cft with central charge c = 6q1q5 [18]. we
write down the ten dimensional metric for the d1 + d5 brane system

with v4 the volume of t 4, the d1 + d5 system reduces to the iib string theory on ads3 
s3  t 4 with the same radius for ads3 and s3, which is conjectured to be dual to the
two dimensional (4,4) super cft. recently this type of ads/cft correspondence has been
explored [19] to be associated with the three dimesional btz black hole and the ads3
chern-simons gravity. further compactifying on s1 of length 2r along y direction we get

a non-extremal ve dimesional black hole labeled by two charges, q1 and q5. in the dilute
gas condition r0  r1, r5, which is contained in the decoupling limit (43), the black hole
mass and entropy are given by

with the ve dimensional newton constant g5 = g/v42r and the area of the event horizon
a = 2r1r5r0. in the extremal limit r0  0 the entropy vanishes, which is compared to the
non-zero entropy of the ve dimensional extremal black hole with three charges, q1, q5 and
further momentum running along the string [20, 21]. the non-extremality parameter r0 is
linear to the hawking temperature as r0 = 2r1r5t , that is similarly seen in the near-horizon
d3-brane system. gathering together we obtain the free energy

f =

r(q1 + vq5)

 22q1q5rt 2.

(45)

subtracting the extremal part in the same way as the previous dp-brane system we have
f (q1, q5) = 22q1q5rt 2, which shows the expected scaling for the free energy of the
1 + 1 dimensional cft. in deriving f (q1, q5) we have observed that the dependences of
gs and ls are cancelled out.
it agrees with (32) with p = 1, v1 = 2r and n = q1q5.
the combination q1q5 may be associated with the degrees of freedom in the dual cft,
that is, the central charge c = 6q1q5 or the number of the open strings connected between
d1-branes and d5-branes in a free string gas [21]. so we have an interesting expression
f (q1, q5)/2r = ct 2/6.
can be expressed in the decoupling limit as

the action (36) with p = 1 for a static d1-brane probe in the d1 + d5 brane background

i1 = t12rh 1

1 (h  1),

(46)

where e2 = h5/h1 is taken into account and h1 is given by h1  gsq1l2
s/vr2. similar
probe actions were studied in ref.[22], where the ve dimensional black hole with three
charges are argued. under the long distance expansion in r0/r the leading term in the free
energy of a d1-brane probe at a position r is estimated as

f1 = 

rvr2
0
s l4
sq1

2g2

,

which is further rewritten in terms of t as

comparing the two free energies we can derive a fascinating relation

f1 = 22rq5t 2.

f1 = f (q1 + 1, q5)  f (q1, q5),

(47)

(48)

(49)

which shows the same subtractive behavior as (41). thus the free energy for a d1-brane probe
separated from the q1 d1-brane and q5 d5-brane source can be expressed as a dierence
between the free energy for q1 + 1 d1-brane and q5 d5-brane system and that for q1 d1-
brane and q5 d5-brane system. therefore it can be interpreted as the contribution of the
q5 massive open strings stretched from the q5 d5-branes to the single d1-brane probe.

further we repeat a similar analysis for the d5-brane probe in the same background. in

the action (36) with p = 5 for a d5-brane probe the decoupling limit yields

i5 = t5v5h 1

5 (h  1)

(50)

with v5 = v42r. the leading part of the low temperature expansion for the associated free
energy is given by

a similar relation is again encountered as

f5 = 22rq1t 2.

f5 = f (q1, q5 + 1)  f (q1, q5),

(51)

(52)

which consistently shows the free energy for the d5-brane probe separated from the non-
extremal d1 + d5 source. the free energy f5 is also characterized by the q1 massive open
strings stretched between the single d5-brane probe and the q1 d1-branes.

we have analyzed the free energies of the n coincident non-conformal d0, d1 and d2
brane systems and observed the free energy matchings by deriving the perturbative sym
free energies in the high temperature transition region as well as the free energies of the
matrix black hole, the free orbifold cft and the cft with so(8) r-symmetry in the low
temperature transition region. we have presented the generalized smarr formula for the
mass of d = 10  p dimensional black hole obtained upon dimensional reduction from
the ten dimensional n coincident non-extremal dp-brane system. the dbi action of the
dp-brane probe in the n coincident dp-brane background has been shown to be related
in a subtractive form with the dp-brane supergravity free energy and interpreted as the
contribution of massive modes in the sym picture associated with the u(n + 1)  u(n) 
u(1) symmetry breaking. it is interesting to note that the characteristic (5  p) factor in
the dp-brane supergravity free energy is reproduced by calculating the nite temperature
partition function in the canonical ensemble and also plays an important role in order to
obtain the subtractive relation.

the free energy of the ve dimensional black hole with two charges obtained upon di-
mensional reduction from the near-horizon d1 + d5 brane system has been constructed and
shown to agree with that of the two dimensional super cft. its free energy is character-
ized by the number of open strings connected between the d1-branes and the d5-branes.
we have also found the subtractive relation between its free energy and the d1-brane or
d5-brane probe action in the d1 + d5 background. the obtained two relations, which are
symmetric each other, imply a simple and consistent picture that the free energy associated
with the d1-brane or d5-brane probe action is regarded as the constribution of the massive
open strings stretched between the single probe d1-brane and the source d5-branes or vice
versa.

it is worth noting that though we have found the similar subtractive relations in the two
near-horizon systems, the n dp-brane system and the d1 + d5 system, there is a slight
dierence. the former ads-like geometry is associated with the strongly-coupled p + 1 di-
mensional u(n) sym interacting gauge theory itself, while the latter ads itself is associated
with the free string gas, or equivalently the ir limit of the higgs branch of two dimensional
u(q1)  u(q5) sym gauge theory. this dierence is reected in the numbers of relevant
degrees of freedom and the free energy expressions. it would be interesting to investigate
whether there exist the similar subtractive relations between the free energy and the d-
brane probe action in the near-horizon systems for the bound state of the dp-branes and the
d(p  4)-branes, and the other bound states in order to gain deeper understandings of the
duality between the near-horizon system and the underlying cft from the thermodynamical
view point.
