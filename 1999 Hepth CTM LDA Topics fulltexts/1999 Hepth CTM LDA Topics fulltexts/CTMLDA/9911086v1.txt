abstract

a complete qualitative study of the dynamics of string cosmologies is pre-
sented for the class of isotopic curvature universes. these models are of bianchi
types i, v and ix and reduce to the general class of friedmannrobertson
walker universes in the limit of vanishing shear isotropy. a nontrivial two
form potential and cosmological constant terms are included in the system. in
general, the twoform potential and spatial curvature terms are only dynami-
cally important at intermediate stages of the evolution. in many of the models,
the cosmological constant is important asymptotically and anisotropy becomes
dynamically negligible. there also exist bouncing cosmologies.

1 introduction

one of the strongest constraints that a unied theory of the fundamental interactions
must satisfy is that it leads to realistic cosmological models. there are known to
be ve consistent perturbative superstring theories in ten dimensions.
(see, e.g.,
ref. [1]). the type ii and heterotic theories each contain a neveuschwarz/neveu
schwarz (nsns) sector of bosonic massless excitations that includes a scalar dilaton
eld, a graviton and an antisymmetric twoform potential. the interactions between
these elds lead to signicant deviations from the standard, hot big bang model based
on conventional einstein gravity [2] and a study of the cosmological consequences of
superstring theory is therefore important.

in string cosmology, the dynamics of the universe below the string scale is deter-
mined by the eective supergravity actions. the nsns string cosmologies contain
the nontrivial elds discussed above. recently [3] (hereafter referred to as paper i),
a complete qualitative analysis for the spatially at friedmannrobertsonwalker
(frw) and axisymmetric bianchi type i nsns string cosmologies was presented. a
central charge decit was also included and found to have signicant eects on the na-
ture of the equilibrium points. this study unied and extended previous qualitative
analyses of this system [57].

in ref.

[4] (hereafter referred to as paper ii), a phenomenological cosmological
constant was introduced into the string frame eective action in such a way that it
was not coupled directly to the dilaton eld. such a term yields valuable insight into
the dynamics of more general string models containing nontrivial ramondramond
(rr) elds. the interplay between such a cosmological constant and the twoform
potential had not been considered previously. it was found that the interactions led
to heteroclinic orbits in the phase space, where the universe underwent a series of
oscillations between expanding and contracting phases.

the purpose of the present paper is to extend the work of [3, 4] to both isotropic
and anisotropic cosmologies containing spatial curvature terms.
in particular, we
consider the class of isotropic curvature universes [8, 9]. these are spatially homoge-
neous but contain non-trivial curvature and anisotropy. the characteristic feature of
these models is that the three-dimensional ricci curvature tensor is isotropic. in other
words, (3)rij is proportional to kij on the spatial hypersurfaces and these surfaces
therefore have constant curvature k [8]. the class of isotropic curvature universes
contains the bianchi type i (k = 0) and v (k < 0) models and a special case of the
bianchi type ix (k > 0) models [9].

the fourdimensional line element of these cosmologies is given by [8, 9]

ds2 = dt2 + e2(t)(cid:20)(cid:16)1(cid:17)2

+ e23s(t)(cid:16)2(cid:17)2

+ e23s(t)(cid:16)3(cid:17)2(cid:21) ,

(1.1)

where the one-forms {1, 2, 3} are given in [8, 9]. the spatial hypersurfaces, t =
constant, are the surfaces of homogeneity. the variable, , parametrizes the eective

1

spatial volume of the universe and  determines the level of anisotropy. we refer to it
as the shear parameter. in essence, the isotropic curvature models can be regarded as
the simplest anisotropic generalizations of the at (k = 0), open (k < 0) and closed
(k > 0) frw universes, respectively. the isotropic models are recovered when  = 0.
the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we summarize the form of the eec-
tive actions we consider. the cosmological eld equations are derived and the general
asymptotic behaviour of the twoform potential and spatial curvature is discussed.
the global qualitative dynamics for the dierent classes of models is determined in
sections 3 and 4. we summarize and conclude our results in section 5. the func-
tional forms of the equilibrium points that arise in the analysis are presented in the
appendix.

2 cosmological field equations

2.1 string eective action

the nsns sector of massless bosonic excitations is common to both the type ii and
heterotic superstring theories. the fourdimensional, string eective action for the
nsns elds can be written as [14]

s = z d4xge(cid:20)r + ()2 

1
12

hh   2(cid:21) ,

(2.1)

where the string coupling, g2
s  e, is determined by the value of the dilaton eld, ,
the spacetime manifold has metric, g, and ricci curvature, r, the antisymmetric
twoform, b, has a eld strength h  [b], and g  detg. the central
charge decit of the theory is denoted by the constant, . the value of this term
depends on the conformal eld theory that is coupled to the string and it can be
positive or negative. such a term may also arise from the compactication of higher
dimensional form elds or nonperturbative corrections to the selfinteraction of the
dilaton eld [15].

the threeform h is dual to a oneform in four dimensions and the eld equa-

tion for b is solved by the ansatz [16]

h   e,

(2.2)

where  is the covariantly constant fourform. the scalar  may be interpreted
as a pseudoscalar axion eld. the bianchi identity, [h]  0, is then solved by
reinterpreting this constraint as the eld equation for  and this latter equation can
be derived from the dual eective action [16]

s = z d4xge(cid:20)r + ()2 

1

e2 ()2  2(cid:21) .

(2.3)

we establish the dynamics of cosmological models derived from eq. (2.3) in section
3.

in paper ii, the action

s = z d4xg(cid:26)e(cid:20)r + ()2 

1
2

e2 ()2(cid:21)  m(cid:27)

(2.4)

was considered, where m was interpreted as a phenomenological cosmological con-
stant arising from the interaction potential of a slowly rolling scalar eld. we now
proceed to discuss this action within the context of the massive type iia supergravity
theory in ten dimensions [10]. this theory represents the lowenergy limit of the type
iia superstring and has been the subject of renewed interest recently following the
advances that have been made in our understanding of the nonperturbative features
of string theory [12, 13].

in this theory, the nsns twoform potential becomes massive. in the absence

of such a eld, the action is given in the string frame by [12]

(2.5)
where  represents the tendimensional dilaton eld, m2 is the cosmological constant
and a = (0, 1, . . . , 9), etc. the antisymmetric eld strengths fab and fabcd for the
one-form and threeform potentials represent rr degrees of freedom because they
do not couple directly to the dilaton eld [1]. the massless theory is recovered when
m = 0.

maharana and singh [11] have employed the kaluzaklein technique [18, 19] to
compactify the tendimensional theory (2.5) on a sixdimensional torus. we consider
a truncation of the dimensionally reduced fourdimensional action, where we include
only the components of the fourform on the fourdimensional external spacetime. we
therefore neglect the moduli elds arising from the compactication of the form elds
and the gauge elds originating from the higherdimensional metric. the eective
fourdimensional action is then given by

1
48

s = z d4xg(cid:26)ehr + ()2  6 ()2i 
where the fourdimensional dilaton, , is dened in terms of the tendimensional
dilaton by     6 and  parametrizes the volume of the torus.
the bianchi identity for the threeform potential is trivially satised in four di-
mensions and its eld equation is solved by the ansatz f  = qe6, where
q is an arbitrary constant and  is the covariantly constant fourform. applying
this duality, together with the conformal transformation

m2e6(cid:27) , (2.6)

e6ff

g = 2g,

2  e

(2.7)

implies that the eective fourdimensional action may be expressed in the einstein
frame as

s = z d4xqg(cid:20) r

1

2 (cid:16) y(cid:17)2

where y  12 represents a rescaled modulus eld.

m2e2+3y(cid:21) ,

(2.8)

without loss of generality, one may perform linear translations on the dilaton and
modulus elds such that the parameters q and m become eectively equal. thus,
action (2.8) may be written in the form

s = z d4xqg(cid:20) r 

1

2 (cid:16) (cid:17)2



1

2 (cid:16) y(cid:17)2

 me2 cosh(cid:16)3y(cid:17)(cid:21) ,

(2.9)

where m is a positivedenite constant. it follows, therefore, that the fourform and
tendimensional mass parameter together provide an eective potential for the mod-
ulus eld with a global minimum located at y = 0. consequently, the internal space
can become stabilized for this specic compactication and a consistent truncation of
the eective action is therefore given by specifying y = 0 in eq. (2.9). applying the
inverse of the conformal transformation (2.7) then implies that the eective string
frame action is given by eq. (2.4) when the axion eld is trivial. thus, a truncated
form of eq. (2.4) is relevant to the type iia theory. the dynamics of these models is
considered in section 4.

for the purposes of deriving the cosmological eld equations from the eective

actions (2.3) and (2.4), we combine these two expressions into the single action

s = z d4xg(cid:26)e(cid:20)r + ()2

2

e2 ()2  2(cid:21)  m(cid:27)

(2.10)

where it is understood that either  or m should be set to zero. we assume that all
massless degrees of freedom are constant on the surfaces of homogeneity, t = constant.
the eld equations derived from action (2.10) for the isotropic curvature metric (1.1)
are then given by

the moduli elds that may also arise in the string eective action from the com-
pactication of higher dimensions have not been included in eq. (2.1) and it is as-
sumed, in particular, that the internal dimensions are xed. we emphasize, however,
that in the nsns model (m = 0), one may readily include the dynamical eects of
these extra dimensions in the case of a toroidal compactication, where the internal
space has the topology t = s1 s1 . . . s1, by reinterpreting the shear parameter,
, in the eld equations (2.11)(2.16) [3, 19]. modulo a trivial rescaling, the moduli
elds, m, that parametrize the radii of the circles, s1, have the same functional form
in the eld equations as the shear term. these moduli may therefore be combined

with the shear by replacing 2 with an expression of the form 2 = 2 +p 2

m.

2.2 asymptotic behaviour

before concluding this section, we make some general remarks regarding the asymp-
totic behaviour of the cosmological models discussed above.

it can be shown that the action (2.10) is invariant under a global sl(2, r) trans-
formation acting on the dilaton and axion elds when the cosmological constants 
and m vanish [16]. the symmetry becomes manifest in the conformally related ein-
stein frame (2.7) and may be employed to generate a nontrivial axion eld from a
solution where such a eld is trivial [21]. solutions containing a dynamical axion eld
are known as dilatonaxion cosmologies. the constant axion solutions are referred
to as dilatonvacuum solutions and are presented in eq. (a.1).

the functional form of the dilatonaxion cosmologies has been derived [21]. the
general feature exhibited by these models is that the axion eld is dynamically im-
portant only for a short time interval. the solutions asymptotically approach one
of the dilatonvacuum solutions (a.1) in the high and low curvature regimes. the
axion eld also results in a lower bound on the value of the dilaton eld and therefore
the string coupling. however, the sl(2, r) symmetry is broken when either of the
cosmological constants is present in the action (2.10) [22] and analytical solutions are
not known in this case, even in the isotropic limit (  = 0).

5

in addition, the variables k and  in eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) may in general be

combined to dene the new variable

  k
 + k

.

 

(2.20)

this implies that eqs. (2.14) and (2.15) are equivalent to the evolution equation

 = 2 (cid:16)1  2(cid:17) .

(2.21)

hence, all of the equilibrium points occur either for  = 0 or for 2 = 1 and this
implies that either  = 0 ( = 1) or k = 0 ( = +1) asymptotically if  6= 0.
in general, eqs. (2.11)-(2.16) dene a four-dimensional dynamical system. (al-
though there are ve odes, eq. (2.16) may be employed to globally reduce the
system by one dimension).
in the cases in which all of the equilibrium points lie
on 2 = 1, the asymptotic properties of the string cosmologies can be determined
from the dynamics in the three-dimensional sets  = 0 or k = 0. the latter three-
dimensional dynamical system was studied in papers i and ii.

in view of this, we explicitly examine the three-dimensional  = 0 case in what
follows. the only case in which there exist equilibrium points with  = 0 but 2 6= 1
occurs in the ns-ns case (m = 0) in which k > 0 and  > 0. we shall examine
the full four-dimensional system in this case, although the three-dimensional subset
 = 0 still plays a principal role in the asymptotic analysis.

all solutions represented by the equilibrium points that arise in this work are
presented in the appendix. some of these points also arose in papers i and ii, where
they were labelled dierently. in table 1, we list all the equilibrium points obtained
and unify the notation employed in the dierent works.

3 non-zero central charge decit (m = 0)

in this section we perform the qualitative analysis for the nsns string eective
action (2.10) with m = 0 for an arbitrary central charge decit. through eq.
(2.16), we eliminate the variable  from the eld equations, and make the following
denitions:

(3.1)

the  signs in the denitions for u and v are to ensure that u > 0 and v > 0
when necessary. with these denitions, all variables are bounded such that 0 
{x 2, y 2, z, u, v }  1 and eq. (2.16) now reads

equilibrium points (with dierent notation) in papers i [3] and ii [4] are listed in the
appropriate row. note: the equilibrium points in parentheses in the rst row are just
endpoints to the lines l, v or w . similarly, equilibrium point c in the second row
is the endpoint for the line l1 for y1 = y2 = 1. (see the text for the denition of yi).
the points r and a in the rst row represent dierent solutions to those represented
by the points r and a in the fourth row. also, in the third row, point f corresponds
to point s1 only.

the variable  is dened in each of the following four cases (the section in which

they occur is indicated in parentheses) by:

  > 0

 k > 0: 2  3 k + 2 (section 3.1),
 k < 0: 2  2 (section 3.2),

  < 0

 k > 0: 2  3 k + 2  2 (section 3.3),
 k < 0: 2  2  2 (section 3.4).

for example, consider  > 0 with k > 0; for this case y 2 + u = 1 and eq. (3.2)
reads

1
2

2 = 1  v  x 2  z  0.

(3.3)

hence, we use {x, v, z} as the phase space variables (see section 3.1 for details). we
now consider each of these cases in turn and introduce subscripts i = (1, 2, 3, 4) to
the variables {x, y, z, u, v } to distinguish the dierent subsections.
for each case, we will set up the four-dimensional dynamical system, followed by a
discussion of the k = 0 invariant set as examined in paper i. note that in section 3.2
the k = 0 case is identical to that presented in section 3.1 and is therefore omitted

7

from that section. similarly, there will be no k = 0 discussion in section 3.4 since
it is discussed in section 3.3. we will then examine the  = 0 invariant set. as
discussed in section 2.2, all equilibrium points discussed below which have  = 0
also have 2 6= 1, and hence nearly all the orbits asymptote towards the equilibrium
points in one of the invariant sets  = 0 or k = 0. the qualitative behaviour of the
four-dimensional phase space in each case is then examined.

3.1 the case  > 0, k > 0
we dene 2 = 2 + 3 k and utilize the positive signs for u1 and v1 as dened by eq.
(3.1). from the generalized friedmann equation we have that

the zero eigenvalues arise because these are all lines of equilibrium points. here, the
global sources are the lines l1 (for y1 > 0 or  > 0) and l (for x1 < 13). the
global sinks are the lines l1 (for y1 < 0) and l+ (for x1 > 13

since it is the only one with the line of equilibrium points, l1, inside the phase space.

this line acts as both sink and source, and corresponds to the exact static solution
(a.3) which generalizes the static linear dilatonvacuum solution (a.4) [23]. this
solution was examined in [7] for  > 0 and was shown by a perturbation analysis to
be a late-time attractor.

the lines l correspond to the spatially at, dilaton-vacuum solutions (a.1). the

corresponding stable solutions are in the range h > 1
respectively.

3.1.1 the invariant set k = 0 for  > 0

this invariant set was studied in paper i, and the dynamics there used the variables
{x1, z1,   1  x 2
1  z1  v1}. it was found that z1 is a monotonically increas-
ing function (as it is in the full four-dimensional set). the early time behaviour of
most trajectories is to asymptote towards the linear dilatonvacuum solution (a.4),
represented by the point c, where all degrees of freedom except  are dynamically
static. to the future, these solutions asymptote towards the line l+ for x1 >  13.
we note that the point c is the y1 = 1 endpoint of the line l1. fig. 1 depicts this
phase space.

3.1.2 the invariant set  = 0 for  > 0, k > 0

in the  = 0 case, the system reduces to the three dimensions of {x1, y1, z1} (v1 =
1  x 2
1  z1). the equilibrium points are the lines l with eigenvalues 1, 2 and
3 (from section 3.1), and the two endpoints of l1 with eigenvalues  and 3 (from
section 3.1). these endpoints are specied by the condition y 2
1 = 1 and we denote
them by l()

, where the  in the superscript reects the sign of y1.

for this invariant set the entire line l+ acts as a global sink and the entire line
l acts as a global source. furthermore, we note that for l1 ,  = 0, and so these
two points are non-hyperbolic. however, the eigenvectors associated with these zero
eigenvalues are both [ 23, 1, 0] and are completely located in the (x1, y1) plane. hence,
if we choose z1 = 0 and rotate the (x1, y1) axes such that

x  (y1  1)

y  (y1  1) +

we see that in the vicinity of the equilibrium point, the trajectories along x for y = 0
are also along these eigenvectors. hence, for y = 0 and small x, it follows that

consequently, for y1 = +1, the trajectory along x asymptotes towards the equilib-
rium point, whereas the trajectory along x for y1 = 1 asymptotes away from the
equilibrium point. this implies that the points l1 are saddle points. the phase
space is depicted in fig. 2.

the quantity x1/z1 is monotonically decreasing. such a monotonic function
excludes the possibility of periodic or recurrent orbits in this three-dimensional space.
therefore, solutions generically asymptote into the past towards l and into the
future towards l+. in this three-dimensional set, spatial curvature is dynamically
important only at intermediate times.

3.1.3 qualitative analysis of the four-dimensional system

the qualitative dynamics in the full four-dimensional phase space is as follows. the
past attractors are the line l for x1 < 13 and the line l1 for y1 > 0. the future-
attractor sets are the lines l+ for x1 > 13 and the line l1 for y1 < 0. we note
that y1/v1 is monotonically increasing and this implies that there are no periodic

or recurrent orbits in the full fourdimensional phase space. therefore, solutions are
generically asymptotic in the past to either the line l for h < 1
3 or to the line l1
for n > 0. similarly, solutions are generically asymptotic in the future to either l+
for h > 1
since y1/v1 is monotonically increasing, y1  +1 or v1  0 asymptotically to
the future. these limits represent global sinks on the line l+. conversely, y1  1
or v1  0 asymptotically to the past, corresponding to the global sources on the line
l. there are also equilibrium points for nite y1  y inside the phase space on
the line l1. again, since y1/v1 is monotonically increasing, the points y < 0 are
global sinks and y > 0 are global sources. all of this is consistent with the above
discussion presented in section 2.2 regarding the generic asymptotic behaviour.

we note that the reections x1  x1 and y1  y1 are equivalent to a
time reversal of the dynamics. therefore, there are orbits starting on the line l
(for x1 < 13 ) and ending on the line l1 (for y < 0). similarly, there are orbits
which begin on the line l1 (for y > 0) and end on the line l+ (for x1 > 13).
due to the existence of the monotonic function and the continuity of orbits in the
four-dimensional phase space, solutions cannot start and nish on l1. this is best
illustrated in the invariant set z1 = 0. in addition, orbits may start on the line l
(for x1 < 13) and end on the line l+ (for x1 > 13). investigation of the invariant
set z1 = 0 also indicates which sources and sinks are connected; not all orbits from
l can evolve towards l+.

although the lines l lie in both of the invariant sets  = 0 and k = 0, the line l1
does not. on this line, x1 = 0, and the solutions are therefore static (  =  = 0). eq.
(2.21) then implies that the axion eld and spatial curvature can both be dynamically
signicant at early and late times for the appropriate orbits.

3.2 the case  > 0, k < 0

in this case, we choose the negative sign for u2 in eq. (3.1), the positive sign for v2,
and the denition 2 = 2. the generalized friedmann constraint (2.16) now implies
that

(3.11)
2 = 1, and so the four-dimensional system consists of the variables

the point c represents the static linear dilatonvacuum solution (a.4). the
saddle s+ represents the  branch of the milne solution (a.2), where only the
curvature term and scale factor are dynamic.

3.2.1 the invariant set  = 0 for  > 0, k < 0

in the  = 0 case, the system reduces to the three dimensions of {x2, z2, u2} (v2 =
1  x 2
2  z2  u2). the equilibrium points are the same as above with eigenvalues
1, 2 and 3. we note that for this invariant set the entire line l+ acts as a global
sink, and c acts as a source. although one of the eigenvalues for the point c is
zero, it is shown in the following subsubsection that this point is a source in the full
fourdimensional phase space. the argument is identical in this subsection.

the variable z2 is monotonically increasing, and as such we see that the shear
term is negligible at early times, but becomes dynamically signicant at late times.
there are no periodic or recurrent orbits in this threedimensional phase space due
to the existence of this monotonic function. in general, solutions asymptote into the
past towards the static solution (a.4) (point c). solutions asymptote into the future
towards l+. fig. 3 depicts this three-dimensional phase space.

3.2.2 qualitative analysis of the four-dimensional system
the qualitative behaviour for the invariant set k = 0 is discussed in section 3.1.1
(see fig. 1). in the four-dimensional set, the point c is non-hyperbolic because of
the two zero eigenvalues. however, it can be shown that this point is a source in
the four-dimensional set by the following argument. we rst note that the variable
z2 is monotonically increasing and hence orbits asymptote into the past towards the
invariant set z2 = 0. similarly, v2 is a monotonically decreasing function, and so
orbits asymptote into the past towards large v2 (i.e., v2 = 1). this implies that they
asymptote towards the point c.

(3.21)

it is clear from eq. (3.21) that v2 increases monotonically into the past. now, this
three-dimensional phase space is bounded by the surface x 2
2 + u2 + v2 = 1, the
apex of which lies at v2 = 1 (and x2 = u2 = 0). therefore, all orbits in or on
this phase space boundary lie below v2 = 1, and therefore asymptote into the past
towards v2 = 1. to further illustrate that this point is indeed a source, it is helpful
to consider the invariant set z2 = u2 = 0, x 2
2 + v2 = 1. in the neighbourhood of c,
eq. (3.19) becomes dx2/dt = x2(1  x 2
2 ), indicating that orbits are repelled from
x2 = 0. hence, the point c is the past attractor to the full four-dimensional set.

the future attractor for this set is the line l+ (for x2 > 13

). both c and l+ lie in
both of the invariant sets  = 0 and k = 0, which is consistent with the analysis of eq.
(2.21). we conclude, therefore, that the spatial curvature terms and the axion eld
are dynamically important only at intermediate times, and are negligible at early
and late times. the dynamical eect of the shear becomes increasingly important
because the variable z2 increases monotonically. on the other hand, the variable
v2 decreases monotonically and the dynamical eect of the central charge decit, ,
becomes increasingly negligible. in addition, the existence of monotone functions in
the fourdimensional phase space prohibits closed orbits and serves as proof of the
evolution that is described above.

3.3 the case  < 0, k > 0

we choose the positive sign for u3 and the negative sign for v3 in eq. (3.1) to ensure
that these variables are positive denite. we also dene 2  2 + 3 k  2 for this
case. the generalized friedmann constraint equation can then be rewritten as

0  x 2

y 2

where again the zero eigenvalues arise because these are all lines of equilibrium points.
here, the global sink is the line l+ for x3 > 13 (saddle otherwise), and the global
source is the line l for x3 < 13
(saddle otherwise). stable solutions on the line l+
correspond to the range h > 1

3 . the stable solutions on l arise when h < 1
3.

3.3.1 the invariant set k = 0 for  < 0

this invariant set was studied in paper i, the dynamics of which are as follows. the
variables x3 and y3 are monotonically increasing functions, corresponding to  and 
(respectively). the former implies that these trajectories represent cosmologies that
are initially contracting and then reexpand. in paper i, the third variable used was
  1  x 2
3  z3. this is proportional to  and is only dynamically signicant at
intermediate times. it asymptoted to zero into the past and future, indicating that
the axion eld is negligible at early and late times. all the equilibrium points in this
invariant set are represented by the dilaton-vacuum solutions (a.1) (the lines l).
in general, orbits asymptote into the past towards the line l (for x3 < 13 ), and
asymptote to the future towards the line l+ (for x3 > 13). fig. 4 depicts this
three-dimensional phase space, using the variables {x3, y3, }.
3.3.2 the invariant set  = 0 for  < 0, k > 0

since  6= 0 at the equilibrium points, we examine the  = 0 case, where the system
reduces to the three dimensions {x3, y3, v3} (z3 = 1  x 2
3 ). the equilibrium points
are the same as above with eigenvalues 1, 2, 3. we note that the entire line l+ acts
as a global sink and that the entire line l acts as a global source in this invariant
set. the function y3/v3 is monotonically increasing, eliminating the possibility of
periodic orbits. fig. 5 depicts this three-dimensional phase space.

3.3.3 qualitative analysis of the four-dimensional system

asymptote into the past towards the line l (for x3 < 13), and into the future
towards l+ (for x3 > 13). in the former case the stable solutions are given by the
+ branch of eq. (a.1) for h < 1
3. the stable sinks are given by the  branch
with h > 1
3 . again, we see that the curvature term, axion eld and the central
charge decit are dynamically important only at intermediate times. the existence
of the monotonically increasing function y3/v3 excludes the possibility of periodic
orbits and serves to verify the above description of the evolution of the solutions in
the fourdimensional set.

3.4 the case  < 0, k < 0
for this case, the appropriate denition for the variable  is 2 = 2  2 and we
choose the negative signs for both u4 and v4 in eq. (3.1). the generalized friedmann
constraint equation is written as

3.4.2 qualitative analysis of the four-dimensional system
the dynamical behaviour in the invariant set k = 0 is identical to that described
in section 3.3.1 (see fig. 4). the qualitative dynamics in the full four-dimensional
phase space is as follows. since y4 is monotonically increasing, the orbits asymptote
into the past towards y4 = 1 and into the future towards y4 = +1. as in the

20

above examples, the existence of such a monotonic function excludes the possibility
of periodic orbits in the fourdimensional phase space. most orbits asymptote into
the past towards the line l (for x4 < 13 ), and into the future towards the line l+
(for x4 > 13
). the range of values for h corresponding to stable solutions is given
by h > 1
for those on l+ and h < 1
3 for those on l. the variable y4 increases
monotonically along orbits and this implies that  is dynamically signicant at early
and late times, but dynamically insignicant at intermediate times. conversely, we
see that the curvature term, central charge decit and axion eld are dynamically
important only at intermediate times, and are negligible at early and late times.

this concludes the qualitative analysis of the isotropic curvature string cosmolo-
gies with nsns elds. in the next section, we consider the eect on the dynamics
of introducing a nontrivial m.

4.1.1 the invariant set k = 0 for m > 0

this invariant set was studied in paper ii by employing dynamical variables equiv-
alent to {1, 1, 1}, and we now summarize the important features of the model.
for spatially isotropic solutions conned to the invariant set 1 = 0, most trajec-
tories evolve from the equilibrium point s+
1 (labelled f  in paper ii) located at
(1, 1, 1) = ( 127 , 0, 16
27 ) (corresponding to the  solution (a.5)) and are future
asymptotic to a heteroclinic orbit. there are two saddle equilibrium points, s1 and
s2, which are the endpoints of the line l+; s1 is given by the  branch of eq. (a.1)
with h = 13 and s2 corresponds to h = 13. there are also the single boundary
orbits in the invariant sets 1 = 0, corresponding to m = 0 and 1 +2
1 = 1 (constant
axion eld). an orbit spends the majority of its time in the neighbourhoods of s1
and s2 and shadows the respective boundary orbits as it rapidly moves between the
two saddles. progressively more time is spent near the saddles for each completed
cycle, and the dynamics is therefore not periodic.

an anisotropic contribution (1 6= 0) does not introduce new sources into the
system and the point s+
is still the only source. fig. 7 depicts the full three-
1
dimensional space. eq. (4.13) implies that 1 is a monotonically increasing function
and consequently the orbits are repelled from s+
1 and spiral out monotonically. the
general behaviour for most trajectories in this phase space is to evolve away from the
equilibrium point s+
27) and eventually
asymptote towards the line l+ for 2
3. these trajectories were discussed in detail
in paper ii.

4.1.2 the invariant set  = 0 for m > 0, k > 0

function, and so the possibility of periodic orbits is excluded. the only equilibrium
points are the lines l with the rst three eigenvalues in eq. (4.15), and therefore
the early and late time attractors are the lines l (for 1 > 13, h > 1

for orbits in the four-dimensional phase space, the complex eigenvalues of the sad-

4.2.1 the invariant set  = 0 for m > 0, k < 0

for this invariant set, the four-dimensional system (4.18)-(4.21) reduces to a three-
dimensional system involving the coordinates {2, 2, 2} (2 = 1  2
2  2  2).
the equilibrium points are the same as for the full four-dimensional set, but the
eigenvalues are now (1, 2, 3). the variable  is a monotonically increasing func-
tion, the existence of which eliminates the possibility of recurrent orbits. thus, the
generic behaviour of this model is for solutions to asymptote into the past towards the
curvaturedominated solution (a.6), represented by the point n, and to the future
towards the line l+ for 2 < 13 (h < 1
3 ). fig. 9 depicts this phase space.

9). the point n lies in the invariant set  = 0 and l+ lies
in both of the invariant sets  = 0 and k = 0. this is consistent with the analysis of
eq. (2.21). we see that 2 is a monotonically increasing function, and so there are no
recurrent or periodic orbits. furthermore, since 2 increases monotonically, the shear
in the model is initially dynamically trivial, but becomes signicant asymptotically
into the future. the axion eld and cosmological constant are only dynamically
important at intermediate times and do not play a role in the early- and late-time
behaviour of the cosmologies. the curvature term is dynamically signicant at early
and intermediate times, but becomes dynamically trivial at late times.

orbits which asymptote into the future towards the k = 0 invariant set generically
end in a heteroclinic sequence, as described in section 4.1.1 and depicted in fig.
7. however, such a sequence does not occur for orbits which asymptote into the
future towards the  = 0 invariant set. indeed, by examining the eigenvalues of the
equilibrium points of the four-dimensional system, there do not seem to be heteroclinic
sequences outside of the k = 0 invariant set.

4.3.1 the invariant set k = 0 for m < 0

in paper ii, this invariant set was examined using variables which are the same as
{3, 3, 3}. there it was shown that 3 is monotonically increasing, so that most
trajectories in this phase space represent bouncing cosmologies which are initially
contracting. most trajectories asymptote into the past towards either l or to r
(see above). to the future, most orbits asymptote towards either l+ or a. fig. 10
depicts this three-dimensional phase space.

4.3.2 the invariant set  = 0 for m < 0, k > 0

for this invariant set, the four-dimensional system (4.26)-(4.29) reduces to a three-
dimensional system involving the coordinates {3, 3, 3} (3 = 1  3
2). the equi-
librium points are the same as the full four-dimensional set, but with eigenvalues
(1, 2, 3), and so the line l is a source for 3 > 13
3 ) and the line l+ is a
3). the function 3/3 is monotonically increasing, and so
sink for 3 < 13 (h < 1
there are no recurring or periodic orbits. hence, solutions generically asymptote into
the past towards l or r and into the future towards l+ or a.

both of the invariant sets  = 0 and k = 0 and the axion eld and curvature term
are dynamically signicant only at intermediate times. for early and late times, the
cosmological constant is dynamically important only when the shear is dynamically
trivial (e.g., the points r and a), and vice-versa (e.g., the lines l).

4.4.2 qualitative analysis of the four-dimensional system

the invariant set k = 0 is discussed in section 4.3.1 (see fig. 10). the function
4/4 is monotonically increasing, and so there are no recurring or periodic orbits.
the asymptotic behaviour is identical to that described in section 4.3.3.

5 discussion

in this paper, we have presented a complete qualitative analysis for the isotropic
curvature string cosmologies derived from the eective action (2.10) in the two cases
where either  = 0 or m = 0 (the cases where both terms are non-zero is discussed in
[24]). this was made possible by compactifying the phase space in terms of suitably
dened variables. when m = 0, eq. (2.10) represents the action for the nsns
elds that arise in both the type ii and heterotic string theories when an arbitrary
central charge decit is present. we identied the cosmological constant m with
terms that arise in the rr sector of the massive type iia supergravity theory when
appropriate conditions apply.

the subset  = 0 corresponds to the class of spatially isotropic frw universes
with arbitrary spatial curvature. in the positively curved case, we have extended the
work of easter et al. [7], who performed a perturbation analysis on the static, closed
frw model to show that it was a late-time attractor. more generally, the models we
have considered represent bianchi type i, v and ix universes.

for each case, we have established the existence of monotonic functions which
precludes the existence of recurrent or periodic orbits. consequently, the early and
latetime behaviour of these models can be determined by analysing the nature of
the equilibrium points/lines of the system.
in all cases, the spatially at dilaton
vacuum solutions l, given by eq. (a.1), act as either early- or late-time attractors
and, in many cases, act as both. because these solutions lie in both the  = 0 and
k = 0 invariant sets and contain neither a central charge decit nor a nonzero
m contribution, we may conclude that the shear and dilaton elds are dynamically
dominant asymptotically. furthermore, with the exception of the  > 0, k > 0 case,
all early-time and late-time attracting sets lie in either the  = 0 invariant set or the
k = 0 invariant set, and a majority of these sets lie in both.

thus, we see a generic feature in which the curvature terms and the axion eld
are dynamically signicant at intermediate times and are asymptotically negligible
at early and late times. the exception to this generic behaviour is the  > 0, k > 0
case, where the generalized linear dilatonvacuum solution (a.3), in which neither
 = 0 nor k = 0, acts both as a repeller (for  < 0) and as an attractor (for  > 0).
in these solutions, the variables  and k are proportional to the central charge decit,
. note that asymptotically  = 0 (and  = 0) and hence these models are static.

when  < 0, the central charge decit is dynamically signicant only at interme-
diate times, and is asymptotically negligible at early and late times. in fact, the only

34

repelling and attracting sets in this instance are the dilatonvacuum solutions. when
 > 0, the central charge decit can be dynamically signicant at both early and
late times, and the corresponding solution is the generalized linear dilatonvacuum
solution (a.3), represented by the line l1. when k > 0, these solutions can be
repelling (  < 0) and attracting (  > 0). when k < 0, the endpoint of this line, c
(representing eq. (a.4)) is a repeller.

when m > 0, the cosmological constant may play a signicant role in the early
and late time dynamics. for instance, although in the four-dimensional sets there are
no repelling or attracting equilibrium points in which m is dynamically signicant,
we have found that the orbits which are attracted to the k = 0 invariant set end in a
heteroclinic sequence which interpolates between two dilatonvacuum solutions (see
section 4.1.1, fig. 7 and paper ii). during this interpolation, the orbits repeatedly
spend time in a region of phase space in which m is dynamically signicant (the
region 1 > 0 in fig. 7), although most time is spent near the dilatonvacuum saddle
points where m is dynamically negligible. when m < 0, the cosmological constant
can be dynamically signicant at both early and late times, since solutions typically
asymptote to the solution (a.7), where the shear and axion eld are static. for the
repelling and attracting sets of the m < 0 cases, the shear term is only dynamically
signicant when the cosmological constant is not, and vice versa.

the parameter  measures the degree of anisotropy in the models. if we dene
isotropization by the condition   0 [25, 26], then we note that in general
 6= 0
at the equilibrium points on the line l. therefore, solutions asymptoting towards
the sinks on these lines do not isotropize to the future. at all other equilibrium
 = 0 and the corresponding appropriate string cosmologies therefore
points, however,
isotropize. this is an important result and a similar situation occurs in the time
reverse models. on the other hand, the question of isotropization of string cosmologies
in a more general context remains an open question. note that the shear in the models
that we have discussed is essentially of bianchi type i. in general relativity with a
perfect uid, it is known that bianchi type i models isotropize whereas in general
spatiallyhomogeneous models do not isotropize [25, 26]).

for the equilibrium points corresponding to the sinks on the line l+,

2  2
( = k = 0), and so the energy densities of the modulus and dilaton elds are
proportional to one another. hence, the corresponding dilatonvacuum solutions are
matter scaling string cosmology solutions, which act as local attractors, similar
to the matter scaling solutions in general relativistic scalar eld cosmologies [27].
finally, for every equilibrium point within these phase spaces, the scale factor of the
corresponding exact solution is a powerlaw function of cosmic time, and therefore
all of the corresponding exact solutions are selfsimilar [28].

the cases in which  < 0 are related to a time reversal of the models discussed in
the text. we have not explicitly considered these models here; however, the conclu-
sions concerning isotropization are similar although the details of these models may
be dierent (e.g., the role of sources and sinks can be interchanged).

35

in conclusion, therefore, we have established the qualitative properties of all the
isotropic curvature string models discussed in the text by nding appropriate mono-
tone functions. typically, the curvature term is dynamically signicant only at in-
termediate times and is asymptotically negligible. there are only two exceptions to
this. the rst corresponds to the case { > 0, k > 0}, where the generalized linear
dilatonvacuum attractors and repellers have a non-negligible curvature. the second
case is the {m > 0, k < 0} model in which the repeller n represents the curvature
driven solution (a.6). finally, we note that when m > 0 there exist heteroclinic
sequences in the invariant set k = 0. this implies that the qualitative behaviour as-
sociated with heteroclinic sequences is only valid for solutions which approach k = 0.

(a.5)

where {a, , , } are arbitrary constants and time is dened over the interval
t < 0 (  > 0) for the equilibrium point s+
1 and t > 0 (  < 0) for the equilibrium
point s1 in section 4.1.

there also exists a spatially curved, isotropic solution with a constant axion eld.

it is given by

the equilibrium point n in section 4.2.

for negative m, there are also the solutions

where {a, , , } are constants. the  sign corresponds to the the sign of t and
+ solution corresponds to the repelling equilibrium point r in section 4.4, whereas
the  solution corresponds to the attracting equilibrium point a in that section.
