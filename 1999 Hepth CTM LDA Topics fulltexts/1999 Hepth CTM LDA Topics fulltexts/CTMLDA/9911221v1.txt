abstract

we study some aspects of low-energy eective actions in 4-d superconformal
gauge theories on the coulomb branch. we describe superconformal invariants
constructed in terms of the n = 2 abelian vector multiplet which play the role of
building blocks for the n = 2, 4 low-energy eective actions. we compute the
one-loop eective actions in constant n = 2 eld strength background in n = 4
sym theory and in n = 2 su (2) sym theory with four hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation. using a classication of superconformal invariants, we
then nd the manifestly n = 2 superconformal form of these eective actions. while
our explicit computations are done in the one-loop approximation, our conclusions
about the structure of the eective actions in n = 2 superconformal theories are
general. we comment on some relations to supergravitygauge theory duality in
the description of d-brane interactions.

1 introduction

the study of the structure of low-energy eective actions in d = 4 superconformal theories
is an important subject from several point of view, in particular, in connection with
interactions of d-branes in string theory. systems of d3-branes have complementary
descriptions in terms of gauge theory and supergravity. as one of the consequences,
the leading-order interaction potential between separated branes admits two equivalent
representations: as a classical supergravity potential between a probe and a source, and
as a leading term in the quantum gauge theory eective action. the agreement between
the supergravity and the gauge theory expressions for the potential is possible because of
the existence of certain non-renormalization theorems on the gauge theory side (see [1, 2]
and references there).

one may conjecture that not only the f 4/x 4 term but all higher terms

cn(g2n)n1 f 2n+2
x 4n



xn=1

(1.1)

in the born-infeld action for a d3-brane probe moving near the core of a multiple d3-
brane source (or in ads5  s5 space) may be reproduced by the leading low-energy, large
n, part of the quantum n = 4 su(n) sym eective action. the latter is obtained by
keeping the u(1) n = 4 vector multiplet as an external background and integrating out
massive sym elds (see, e.g., [3, 4, 5, 6] and refs. there). this conjecture seems likely
for the f 6/x 8 term. indeed, it is easy to
to be true at the rst subleading order, i.e.
show that this term is not present in the n = 4 sym analog [8] of the 1-loop schwinger
eective action, and the result of [7] for the dimensionally reduced 0+1 gauge theory
suggests that this f 6 term should appear in the 2 loop eective action with precisely the
right coecient to match the supergravity expression.

this conjecture seems, however, to run into a problem at the next order of the f 8/x 12
term. according to the supergravity expression (1.1), it should appear in the sym action
only at the 3-loop order, but the 1-loop sym eective action already contains o(f 8)
term. one may hope that the f 8 term does not receive corrections beyond the 3-loop
order, so that the 3-loop correction dominates over the 1-loop and 2-loop terms in the
supergravity limit (g2n  1). still, this may not be enough for the agreement since the
f 8 invariants in the 1-loop sym eective action and in the born-infeld d3-brane action
happen to have dierent lorentz index structure.

in order to shed more light on this problem of the supergravitysym correspondence
one may study the constraints imposed by the superconformal invariance (which is a

1

natural symmetry of the supergravity d3-brane in ads5  s5 action [9, 10, 11]) on
the structure of the sym eective action. a possible strategy is to start with the 1-
loop expression for the low-energy eective action on the coulomb branch written in the
manifestly superconformally invariant form and try to draw some general lessons about
the form of the eective action which may go beyond the 1-loop order.

in this paper we shall consider two superconformal theories in four dimensions  the
n = 4 su(2) sym and the n = 2 su(2) sym with four hypermultiplets in the funda-
mental representation of su(2), with the gauge group spontaneously broken to its u(1)
subgroup. we will be mainly interested in the part of their low-energy eective actions
of n = 2, 4 superconformal theories which involves the physical bosonic elds of n = 2
vector multiplet (vector eld strength and scalars). we will compute the one-loop eective
actions in the constant eld background

(1.2)

which is a special supersymmetric solution of the equations of motion of the abelian
n = 2 vector multiplet (w is the n = 2 gauge supereld strength). the fact that the
theories under consideration are superconformal will allow us to use the classication of
superconformal invariants constructed in terms of the abelian n = 2 vector multiplet
(section 2). as a result, we will be able to restore not only the known f 4type quantum
corrections

h(w, w)  ln w ln w

(1.3)

z d12z h(w, w) ,

computed previously (for n = 4 sym) using supergraph techniques [21, 24] (see also
[15, 16, 17]), but also all terms in the eective action

 = c z d12z ln w ln w + z d12z ln w (cid:16) w 2 d4 ln w(cid:17) + c.c.
+ z d12z (cid:16) w 2 d4 ln w , w 2 d4 ln w(cid:17) ,

(1.4)

which generate the quantum corrections of the form (1.1) in components ( and  are
specic functions of their arguments). while our explicit computations will be done in
the one-loop approximation, our conclusions about the general structure of the eective
action in superconformal theories have a universal, loop-independent, character.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe superconformal invariants
of the n = 2 abelian vector multiplet, which appear as building blocks for the eective
actions of n = 2, 4 superconformal theories.

2

in section 3 we start with the one-loop eective action of n = 4 sym computed for
the constant eld background (1.2), and then restore its general n = 2 supereld form
using superconformal invariance considerations.

in section 4 the analysis of section 3 is extended to the case of n = 2 su(2) sym
with four fundamental hypermultiplets. we nd that a specic feature of the n = 4
super yang-mills theory that there are no type quantum corrections (second term in
(1.4)) in the 1-loop eective action (in particular, the absence of the induced f 6 term) is
not shared by generic n = 2 superconformal theories. this unique property of the n = 4
theory should be a consequence of a hidden n = 4 superconformal symmetry.

some useful facts about n = 1, 2 superconformal transformations are collected in

appendix.

2 superconformal invariants of n = 2 vector

multiplet

in this section we present superconformal invariants of an abelian n = 2 vector multiplet
described by a chiral supereld w(z) and its conjugate w(z) which are subject to the
standard o-shell constraints [12]

d  iw = di
dijw = dij w ,



w = 0 ,

i = 1, 2

dij  d(idj)

 ,

dij  d(i


dj)  .

(2.1)

the n = 2 superconformal transformation law of w reads

 w =  w  2 w .

(2.2)

here  = ada is a superconformal killing vector, the chiral scalar  is dened by eq.
(a.8), see appendix for more details. it follows then that the classical vector multiplet
action

(2.3)

is, of course, superconformal invariant.

svm =

let us assume that w possesses a non-vanishing expectation value, as is the case in n
= 2, 4 superconformal models with the gauge group spontaneously broken to its maximal

compact subgroup. then, using the results of appendix, one check that the following
(anti) chiral combinations

 2 =  2 .

(2.4)

(2.5)

using the fact that n = 2 superconformal transformations preserve the n = 2 superspace
measure d12z = d4x d4 d4 ,

one can construct three types of n = 2 superconformal invariants

where  and  are arbitrary holomorphic and real analytic functions, respectively. these
functionals are the main data describing quantum corrections of the form (1.1) (along with
special contributions with derivatives of the elds required by supersymmetry) which
appear in the low-energy eective actions of n = 2, 4 superconformal theories.

there exist additional superconformal invariants constructed in terms of

where the primary eld dijw transforms as follows

 dijw =  dijw  2i k

(2.11)

however, ij involves the free equation of motion of the n = 2 vector multiplet. as
is well-known, contributions to eective action, which contain the classical equations of

it drops out from all superconformal structures listed below.

chiral-like superconformal invariants, r d4x d4 w 2h(2) + c.c., are equivalent to s2.

motion factor, are ambiguous (in particular, gauge dependent). for that reason we will
ignore dependent quantum corrections in what follows.

a large number of nontrivial superconformal invariants can be obtained by noting that

for a primary supereld ij = ji with the transformation law

 ij =  ij + 2 ij + 2i (i

k j) k ,

its descendant dij ij is also primary,

 dij ij =  dij ij + 2 (  ) dij ij .

(2.12)

(2.13)

given an arbitrary function f (2, 2), the supereld w f (2, 2) transforms like w,
and therefore ij  (w 2 w)1 dij(cid:16)w f (2, 2)(cid:17) has the superconformal transformation

law (2.12). as a consequence, the following combinations

w dij (cid:26)
w dij (cid:26)

1

w 2 w 2 dij(cid:16)w f (2, 2)(cid:17)(cid:27) ,
w 2 w 2 dij(cid:16)w f (2, 2)(cid:17)(cid:27)

1

(2.14)

are superconformal scalars. one more possibility to generate superconformal scalars is to
take su(2) invariant products of several superelds of the form

1

w w

dij(cid:16)w f (2, 2)(cid:17)

(2.15)

and their conjugates which transform similar to ij. then one can repeat the construction
of superconformal invariants discussed above by replacing the arguments of f (2, 2) by
other superconformal scalars, etc.

in this paper, we are mainly interested in the part of the low-energy eective action
of n = 2, 4 superconformal theories, which involves the physical bosonic elds of n = 2
vector multiplet, i.e. the u(1) eld strength and its scalar superpartners, without higher
derivatives. the crucial point is that all relevant component structures are then generated
by the superconformal invariants of the three types given in (2.7), (2.8), (2.9). it should
be noted that while many component structures of interest can be also obtained from the
superconformal invariants generated by (2.14), (2.15) and their descendants, the dierence
between the two descriptions is only in terms which involve higher derivatives of the elds.

let us represent w in terms of its n = 1 supereld partsk

w| =  ,

kour n = 1 conventions correspond to [13].

3 n = 4 super yang-mills theory

in this section we analyze the low-energy eective action of the n = 4 su(2) super
yang-mills theory with the gauge group broken to u(1). a generalization to the case
of an arbitrary semi-simple gauge group spontaneously broken to its maximal abelian
subgroup is straightforward and can be done as in refs.
[15, 16, 17] where the leading
supereld correction to the low-energy action was computed.

our aim will be to nd the manifestly superconformal invariant generalization of the
well-known schwinger-type expression for the bosonic part of the 1-loop eective action
of n = 4 sym theory in the purely bosonic fmn = const background. the use of the
superconformal invariance requirement may allow, in principle, to go beyond the constant
eld approximation.

for example, in the su(2) n = 4 theory with the classical scalar eld value producing
2 , with fmn

the mass parameter x 2 = ||2, the action in the background fmn = fmn
having eigen-values f1 and f2, is given by [8, 18]

expanding in powers of fn  f one nds that there is no f 6/x 8 term, while the f 8/x 12
term has the structure dierent from the one that appears in the expansion of the abelian
bi action (with the scale set up by x):

lbi = x 4[q(1 + f 2

1 /x 4)(1 + f 2

2 /x 4)  1] .

the f 8 terms in the bi and sym actions are thus dierent combinations of the f 8-type
superinvarinats.

below we shall nd how to supersymmetrize the bosonic expression (3.1). using
the background eld formulation [19] for general n = 2 super yang-mills theories in
n = 2 harmonic superspace [20], it was shown [21] that under some restrictions on the
background n = 2 vector multiplet w = {w , }, the one-loop eective action of n = 4
sym admits a simple functional representation in terms of n = 1 superelds

exp(i ) = z d v dv exp(cid:26)i z d8z v v(cid:27) ,

where the operator  is dened by

 = dada + w  d  w  d   ||2 .

(3.2)

(3.3)

the integration in (3.2) is carried out over complex unconstrained n = 1 superelds v, v .
the algebra of n = 1 gauge-covariant derivatives is

{d , d } = 2i d  ,

[da , db] = i fab

[d  , d] = 2i  w  ,

[d  , d ] = 2i    w ,

where

f ,  = (a) (b)  fab = i d(  w )  i  d(w) .

for a simple supereld background

dw = d(w) = const ,

 = const

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

the eective action can be exactly computed using the supereld proper time technique
(see [13] for a review), and the result is [22]

(3.19)

now we come to the key point. untill now we have used the constant eld approx-
imation (3.6). however, in eq. (3.19) we may no longer assume such an approximation.
the eective action of n = 4 sym should be superconformal invariant, but  and 
are basically the only superconformal scalars constructed from both w and  (modulo
contributions involving the free equations of motion terms dw and d2 and higher
derivative invariants, see sec. 2). thus the eective action (3.19) is manifestly invariant
under n = 1 superconformal transformations !

of course, the eective action should not only be manifestly n = 1 superconformal,
but n = 2 superconformal as well. one can restore a n = 2 superconformal form of 
simply by noting that  is a part (2.17) of the leading n = 1 component of .

here the rst term was computed in [21, 24] (see also [15, 16, 17]).

as is seen from (3.27), the one-loop eective action of n = 4 sym does not contain

no f 6-type corrections generated by

(3.28)

such terms are expected to appear at the 2-loop order.

the absence of this f 6 correction at the 1-loop order is a unique feature of the
maximally supersymmetric n = 4 super yang-mills theory (which, as discussed in the
introduction, is crucial for supergravitysym correspondence at the subleading order).
as we are going to demonstrate in the next section, this property is no longer true in
generic n = 2 superconformal models.

it may be instructive to compare the low-energy action (3.19) with the n = 1 super-

symmetric born-infeld action [25]

similar to that of  in (3.19), with x 2 playing the role of ||2. while the two actions
coincide at the leading w 2 w 2 order, they contain dierent combinations of invariants at
higher orders (see also the discussion in introduction). in particular, the subleading f 6
term which was absent in the 1-loop n = 4 sym eective action is present in the bi
action (3.29) and has the form

4 n = 2 superconformal models

in this section we shall consider a special n = 2 superconformal theory  the n = 2
su(n) super yang-mills model with 2n hypermultiplets in the fundamental representa-
tion; the eective action of generic n = 2 superconformal models [26] can be analyzed in
a similar fashion. for simplicity, only the case of n = 2 will be discussed, with the gauge
group su(2) spontaneously broken to its u(1) subgroup.

both n = 2 sym and hypermultiplet models are superconformal invariant at the clas-
sical level. their quantum eective actions include the scale independent non-holomorphic
terms besides standard divergent and holomorphic scale dependent contributions. for spe-
cial combinations of these models divergent and holomorphic contributions cancel out and
the full quantum eective action is superconformal invariant.

for computing the one-loop low-energy eective action of a hypermultiplet coupled to
a background abelian n = 2 vector multiplet it is sucient to make use of the simplest
realization of the hypermultiplet in terms of two n = 1 covariantly chiral superelds 1
and 1 with opposite u(1) charges e = 1, with the action

s = z d8z (cid:16) 11 + 22(cid:17) + (cid:26) i z d6z  1 2 + c.c.(cid:27) ,

d 1,2 = 0 .

(4.1)

in the constant eld approximation (3.6), the eective action is given by a functional
determinant of the dalambertian

which acts on the space of covariantly chiral superelds. the eective action is [27, 28, 22]

c = dada + w d  ||2 ,

the form of hm is determined by the function

(x, y) =

(x, 0) = 1 .

(4.4)

it is useful to introduce a new function (x, y) related to  by

(x, y)  1 = y2(x, y) ,

(x, y) = (y, x) =

y2(cosh x  1)  x2(cosh y  1)

where we have absorbed the uv cuto into the renormalization scale . here the rst
term (holomorphic contribution) may be derived also by other well known methods (see,
e.g. [30]).

in the n = 2 superconformal theories holomorphic contributions cancel out. let
us recall how this happens for the present model with 4 fundamental hypermultiplets.
each hypermultiplet has two su(2) components, so that altogether we have 8 abelian
hypermultiplets with charges e =  1
2 with respect to the unbroken u(1) generated by
1
2 3. in addition, we have the adjoint ghost superelds or two hypermultiplets with u(1)
charges e = 1. the charges may be accounted for by replacing w and  in the eective
action by

w  ew ,

  e .

(4.8)

in obtaining eq. (4.7), we concentrated on the quantum corrections involving the vector multiplet
2  ln( /2) =
strength and did not take into account the eective kahler potential k(, ) =  1
 f () +  f ( ) generated by the holomorphic seiberg potential f () =  1
2 2 ln(/). a deriva-
tion of k(, ) in the framework of the supereld proper time technique, which we used in this paper,
can be found in [29, 13].

with the function (x, y) dened in (3.18). here the last term coincides with the eective

note that since

(x, 0) =

cosh x  1  1

,

(4.10)

the eective action now contains the n = 2 superconformal invariants of the type (2.8)
(and, in particular, the f 6 contributions (3.28)) which were absent in the n = 4 case.

appendix a superconformal transformations

in this appendix we collect basic properties of n = 1, 2 superconformal transformations

the n = 4 sym theory is equivalent to the n = 2 sym coupled to a single hypermultiplet in the
adjoint representation; in this case, the hypermultiplet and the ghost contributions cancel each other,
and the eective action is given by the last term in (4.9).
