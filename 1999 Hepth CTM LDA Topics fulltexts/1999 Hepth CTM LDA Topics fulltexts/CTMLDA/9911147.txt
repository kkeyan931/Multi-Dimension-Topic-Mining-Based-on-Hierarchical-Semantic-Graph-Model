(1, 1) lsts follows denition using d5-branes type iib string theory low-energy behaviour given n = (1, 1) u(k) gauge theory whose gauge coupling g2 . large k, hooft scaling suggests perturbative gauge theory (which free low energies) breaks energy squared scale order 1/g2 = 1/m 2 k = 2 /k. (ii) moduli space metric theories 16 supercharges cannot receive quantum corrections. (1, 1) lsts type iib constructions show r4k/sk, corresponding transverse positions k identical 5-branes. (2, 0) lsts theory construction shows (r4s 1)k/sk, radius 1 2 (recall canonical dimension scalar eld six dimensions two). low-energy theory generic points moduli space involves k tensor multiplets (2, 0) case k vector multiplets (1, 1) case.

(ii) compactications lsts lead many interesting local non-local eld theories. example, low-energy limit lsts 2 gives four dimensional n = 4 sym theories, compactication lsts manifolds gives theories related qcd {$9706109$}. (iii) see next section, lsts rare example theory whose discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) simple, use toy model learn dlcq. (iv) see section 3, linear dilaton backgrounds string theory seem holographically dual lsts, thus studying lsts teach us holography linear dilaton backgrounds (and perhaps give us clues dene holography general backgrounds). 2. dlcq constructions denitions lsts given useful far making explicit computations theories, one would like direct denitions lsts. rst denition found using discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq), quantization theory compactied light-like circle radius r n units momentum around compact circle. large n limit momentum around circle becomes eectively continuous, believed six dimensional results may reproduced. advantage dlcq comes fact negative-momentum modes decouple light-cone frame, dynamics involves positive-momentum modes (for example involve nite number particles). derive dlcq theory need exactly integrate zero modes elds (carrying momentum compact direction), usually brief review little string theories 5 complicated. however, small class theories one derive exact dlcq theory, since enough supersymmetry determine lagrangian integrating zero modes, six dimensional lsts fall class. dlcq lsts may derived either following seibergs prescription regarding dlcq limit compactication small space-like circle {$9710009$}, starting m(atrix) theory, dlcq string theory theory, congurations 5-branes singularities, taking limit dening lsts. derivations lead result detailed literature (and reviewed {$9707250$}), present result. dlcq ak1 (2, 0) lst n units momentum  1 + 1 dimensional n = (4, 4) supersymmetric sigma model 4nk-dimensional moduli space n instantons su(k) (on r4), compactied circle radius = 1/rm 2 . equivalently (by adhm construction), conformal theory describing low-energy limit higgs branch n = (4, 4) u(n) sqcd theory adjoint hypermultiplet k hypermultiplets fundamental representation. moduli space instantons singular, sigma model seems make sense. spectrum chiral operators (2, 0) lst may computed description (a similar computation 0 + 1 dimensional sigma model moduli space instantons performed {$9707250$}). ak1 (1, 1) lsts turns complicated write usual dlcq, simple write dlcq wilson line low-energy u(k) gauge group around light-like circle . large n limit eect wilson line expected disappear. dlcq wilson line conformal theory arises low-energy limit coulomb branch 1 + 1 dimensional n = (4, 4) u(n)k gauge theory bifundamental hypermultiplets adjacent groups (when arrange k gauge groups circle, quiver diagram). again, conformal theory compactied circle radius = 1/m 2 r. removing wilson line corresponds taking gauge couplings innity taking low-energy limit. dlcq gives us explicit non-perturbative denition little string theories, enabling us principle compute states correlation functions. unfortunately, practice computations extremely dicult; conformal theories involved complicated even take large n limit, take limit obtain results lsts six dimensions. thus, dynamical computations made far using dlcq, identications operators states (see, e.g., ). usual dlcq, quite complicated study points moduli space lsts compactications, lead quite dierent dlcq theories. example, dlcq (2, 0) ak1 theory generic point moduli space given deformation higgs branch scft described generic masses k hypermultiplets fundamental representation (which relevant deformation higgs branch scft). brief review little string theories 6 3. holographic constructions second useful construction lsts holographic dual along lines ads/cft correspondence; unlike previous construction one cannot serve denition lsts since non-perturbative denition string/m theory backgrounds involved, seems useful computing correlation functions lsts (at least low energies). ads/cft correspondence  states local conformal eld theories often dual string/m theory compactications including ads spaces, generalized classes local eld theories well (though often dual spaces regions high curvature). however, reason general backgrounds string/m theory (or theory quantum gravity) holographically dual local eld theory, seems likely theory holographically dual quantum gravity minkowski space highly non-local. lsts provide rst example holography non-local non-gravitational theory, turns generally lst-like theories holographically dual backgrounds asymptote string theory linear dilaton background {$9808149$}. ads/cft correspondence, space holographically dual lsts may derived starting string theory background corresponding ns 5-branes taking limit gs 0 (where gs asymptotic string coupling) denes lsts . (2, 0) lsts correct procedure actually start background corresponding m5-branes transverse circle, described above, since background ns 5-branes string theory correspond conguration localized 1 coordinates moduli space. starting background taking appropriate limit leads space p ds2 = h1/3dx2 l2 6 + h 2/3(dx2 11 + du 2 + u 2d2 3), (3.1) 6 metric r6, d2 3 metric 3, x11 compactied circle dx2 radius 2 , h = x j= k (u 2 + (x11 2jm 2 )2)3/2 , (3.2) also k units 4-form ux 3 1. theory compactied space holographically dual ak1 (2, 0) lst. space (3.1) quite complicated, simplies asymptotic regions space. small u x11 space (3.1) becomes ads7 4, holographically dual (2, 0) scfts, expected since scfts low- energy limit (2, 0) lsts. large u physical radius x11 circle becomes small appropriate view background type iia string theory compactication. dening new variable l2 simply su = ke/kls, string metric ds2 string = dx2 6 + d2 + kl2 sd2 3, (3.3) brief review little string theories linear dilaton direction, gs() = e/kls, 7 (3.4) k units 3-form ux 3. note large k curvatures small everywhere, supergravity good approximation low energies. even though behaviour space near boundary dierent ads space, seems principles apply also case; example, ads/cft, correlation functions lsts identied response string/m theory background (3.1) turning boundary values non-normalizable modes elds. space (3.1) modes incoming outgoing waves direction, correlation functions lst correspond s-matrix scattering direction. similarly, type (1, 1) lsts holographically dual near-horizon limit type iib ns 5-branes; unfortunately background becomes singular small u (there analog theory region (3.1)) description less useful computations correlation functions, still used identifying operators states lsts described below. holographic description lsts useful : (i) ads/cft correspondence, correlation functions may computed using supergravity. case supergravity approximation valid (2, 0) lsts large k energies well string scale ms, stringy corrections background (3.3) become important. computation 2-point function energy-momentum tensor lsts described {$9705221$}, possible compute also correlation functions (though actual computations quite complicated). particular, supergravity gives exact description analog hooft limit (2, 0) lsts, ms k taken innity scale 2 /k (which (1, 1) case inverse hooft gauge coupling) kept constant. (ii) big dierence background (3.1) backgrounds dual eld theories near boundary (3.1) string coupling goes zero curvatures small, one compute spectrum elds exactly (and large k cases). full spectrum chiral elds lsts computed way {$9808149$}, turned exactly values k (in ak1 case) spectrum chiral elds eld theories arise low-energy limit lsts. (iii) holographic description used reliably compute states lsts, states propagating weakly coupled region (3.1). example, one states supergraviton multiplet propagating momentum direction, look like continuum states six dimensional point view (the mass shell condition relates 6-dimensional momentum -momentum determine magnitude). turns states supergravity multiplet continuum states starts brief review little string theories 8 scale order 2 2 /k, string states weak coupling region also give rise continuous spectra lst, starting higher values 2. implications existence continuum clear. continuum states also seen dlcq formalism {$9707250$}, related continuum states found sigma models orbifold singularities zero theta angle. (iv) holographic description used analyze behaviour nite temperature energy density, discussed next section. 4. behaviour nite energy density already seen indications lsts local eld theories, strongest indication seems come analyzing equation state lsts nite temperature energy density. local eld theories high-energy behaviour density states always exponential power energy density less one, lsts see exponential energy density. reliable way compute equation state lsts use holographic description. holographic dualities relate nite temperature states non- gravitational theories black hole congurations, hawking temperature black hole equated eld theory temperature, eld theory energy equated mass black hole. entropy black holes computed usual bekenstein-hawking formula relates area. case lsts appropriate black holes (at large enough energy densities) near-horizon limits near-extremal ns5-branes computation rst done context {$9704089$}. result e = ths; th ms/6k, (4.1) reliable curvatures black hole background small (requiring k 1) string coupling black hole horizon small (recall string coupling becomes weaker weaker one goes towards boundary), requiring energy density e/v satises km 6 . thus, nd large k large energy densities equation state hagedorn-like, corresponding limiting temperature theory th ms/6k; energy density smaller km 6 longer increases temperature, remains = th. specic heat diverges increasing energy density behaviour similar behaviour single-string states free string theory, th ms; however, string theory believed (at least cases) temperature th phase transition dierent phase state becoming massless = th condenses {$9603126$}, lsts evidence states becoming massless = th , seems th really limiting temperature (and canonical ensemble cannot dened beyond temperature). brief review little string theories 9 would nice reproduce behaviour (4.1) also dlcq description lsts, seems rather dicult. behaviour (4.1) is, fact, reproduced naive counting density states dlcq description {$9511164$}, relevant states really whose energy scales 1/n large n limit, identifying states much dicult. states whose energy scales 1/n identied {$9707250$}, correspond density states space-time exponential smaller exponent corresponding th ms/12; would interesting identify dlcq states give rise (4.1). clear interpret exponential behaviour equation state lsts. fact density states depends energy volume suggests generic high-energy states single-object congurations, perhaps similar long, space-lling strings. yet known energy density behaviour (4.1) begins, equation state regime < 6 (which relevant, particular, hooft limit lsts described above). general arguments (with assumptions behaviour generic operators lsts) suggest behaviour (4.1) implies non-existence correlation functions operators separations smaller 1 h . presumably, local operators theories, operators smeared distance scales least 1 h . computations holographic formulation give correlation functions operators (which naively local) momentum space, seems fourier transform results position space exist small separations {$9705117$}, consistent non-locality. note scale non-locality suggested arguments dierent (by factor order k) scale non-locality suggested t-duality symmetry. 5. future directions much progress made last years understanding little string theories, many open questions remain. interesting open questions : (i) behaviour lsts high energies clearly governed eld theoretical xed point, interesting understand high-energy behaviour is. indications theory becomes weakly coupled high energies, fact holographic description string coupling vanishes near boundary, string coupling small everywhere holographic dual theory high energy densities. would interesting understand sense theory becomes weakly coupled high energies (perhaps asymptotically free eld theories) simple description high-energy limit. (ii) behaviour intermediate energy scales, governed hooft limit (where take large k look energies order e ms/k), still clear. principle correlation functions scales may computed supergravity, far known behaviour (and behaviour brief review little string theories 10 equation state regime) like eld theory (and, so, eld theory ?) like string theory. (iii) chance discuss lsts lower dimensions less would interesting try classify theories supersymmetry. see similar six dimensional lsts described not. also interesting analyze compactications lsts, give rise many interesting theories. unlike local eld theories, behaviour non-local eld theories upon compactication determined behaviour uncompactied theory, studied independently may reveal new results. particular, large k behaviour 5 compactication lsts related m(atrix) theory 5, would interesting understand identify states whose energy scales 1/k large k limit. recently suggested  holographic description lsts becomes weakly coupled one looks particular congurations far lst moduli space. example, congurations (1, 1) theory low- energy u(k) gauge theory broken scale mw argued perturbation expansion ms/mw , used reliably compute correlation functions theories (far moduli space) energies well mw (but potentially scales ms ms/k). perturbation theory indeed reliable congurations would interesting use various computations, see teach us lsts. acknowledgments would like thank t. banks, m. berkooz, s. kachru, d. kutasov, n. seiberg e. silverstein enjoyable collaboration discussions results presented here. research supported part doe grant de-fg02-96er40559.
