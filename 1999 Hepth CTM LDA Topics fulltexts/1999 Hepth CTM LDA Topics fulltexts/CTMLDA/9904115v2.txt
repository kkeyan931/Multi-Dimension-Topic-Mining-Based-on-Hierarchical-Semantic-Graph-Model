abstract

we review a systematic construction of n = 1 supersymmetric heterotic string vacua using mirror
symmetry. the method provides a large class of explicit solutions for stable, holomorphic vector
bundles on calabiyau n-folds zn in terms of toric geometry. phenomenologically interesting
compactications as well as non-perturbative dynamics of the heterotic string are discussed within
this framework.

1. introduction

heterotic string compactications with minimal n = 1 supersymmetry have been the phenomenolog-
in

ically most promising candidate for a unifying theory of particle physics and gravitation for a while.

addition to having the smallest possible amount of supersymmetry, which is supposed to provide, amongst
other, a solution to the problem of why there is such a huge discrepancy between the scales determining the
gravitational and gauge interactions, these theories have rich gauge symmetries, namely e8  e8 or so(32),
in ten dimensions. those should be broken to the gauge groups of standard particle physics, be it grand

unied groups or that of the standard model.

the mathematical conditions that ensure n = 1 supersymmetry in a compactication on a compact
manifold times at d-dimensional minkowski space have been determined a long time ago [1][2][3]. how-
ever explicit solutions to these equations are rather hard to obtain. in this lecture we review a geometric

construction of a large class of such heterotic vacua using a generalized version of mirror symmetry in type
ii strings. in particular we dene a map f : wn+1  (zn, v ) that associates to a (toric) local n + 1 di-
mensional calabiyau geometry wn+1 the data of a (toric) calabiyau n-fold zn together with a family
of vector bundles v (or more generally sheaves) on it. the relation between the type ii string compact-
ications and heterotic strings can be traced back to string dualities, namely type iia/heterotic [4][5][6]

and f-theory/heterotic duality [7][8]. within this context we establish this duality at the classic level and
provide a systematic construction of dual pairs wn+1  (zn, v ), where wn+1 is now the global n + 1-fold
used for f-theory compactication.

2. heterotic n = 1 vacua

the conditions for supersymmetric compactications of perturbative heterotic strings on a manifold z

have been determined in [1][2][3] under some simplifying restrictions, such as the vanishing of the three-

form eld strength h = db + . . . and a constant dilaton background. these conditions are modied in

non-perturbative vacua by the presence of magnetic ve-branes [9].

2.1. perturbative vacua

supersymmetry in the uncompactied space-time requires the existence of a covariantly constant spinor

on z which means that z is a calabiyau manifold. in addition to the geometry one has to specify a gauge
background v on z with the following properties.

the vector bundle v has to satisfy the topological conditions

c1(v ) = 0 mod 2,

(v ) = c2(z),

(2.1)

where  is the four-dimensional characteristic class of v . the rst equation ensures that the bundle v

admits spinors. the second equation derives from the bianchi identity for the three-form eld strength h.

moreover supersymmetry requires that the connection on v satises

fab = fab = 0,

gabf ab = 0.

(2.2)

1

so v is holomorphic and moreover the second equation says that v is a stable bundle.

the third chern class of v is also important:

it determines the net number of generations of the

compactication as [3]

ngen  nantigen =

1
2

c3(v ).

(2.3)

later it was realized that the relevant gauge backgrounds for string theory are not actually smooth

vector bundles but rather include also more singular congurations such as reexive or coherent sheaves [10].
these are also the objects that appear naturally in the geometric construction discussed in the following.

2.2. non-perturbative vacua: ve-branes

the understanding of non-perturbative dynamics of the heterotic string improved dramatically with

the uprise of string dualities. the basic non-perturbative state of the heterotic theory is the magnetic

dual of the fundamental string, the ve-brane. in particular, adding background ve-branes to a heterotic
compactication can yield a new, non-perturbative compactication with the same maximal amount of

supersymmetry as dictated by the compactication geometry [9]. non-perturbative ve-branes add an
extremely rich spectrum of dynamics to the perturbative heterotic string, including non-critical strings [11]

and non-abelian gauge symmetries of very high rank [12].

the presence of non-perturbative ve-branes changes the topological constraint on the gauge background

v . the magnetic ve-brane contributes a source term to the bianchi identity for the three-form h:

dh = trr  r  trf  f  q5b xf ivebranes

(4)
5b ,

which integrates on a four-cycle to

c2(z) = c2(v ) + [w ].

(2.4)

(2.5)

here (4)
5b is a formal four-form that integrates to one in the directions transverse to a single ve-brane and
[w ] denotes the class associated to this last term in (2.4). in other words, a ve-brane is able to correct

the mismatch of gravitational and gauge curvatures in the direction transverse to the world volume. thus
adding ve-branes, which take care of part of the anomaly related to c2(z), enlarges substantially the class
of consistent gauge backgrounds on z [13]. this interplay between gauge elds and ve-branes is clear from
the interpretation of the latter as the zero size limit of gauge instantons [14][11].

lorentz invariant compactications with ve-branes are possible in d  6 compactications.

in six

dimensions, the curvature is localized along k3 and the ve-branes simply ll space-time. these ve-branes
contribute also to the massless spectrum. on the ve-brane of the e8  e8 string, there is an antisymmetric
tensor b with anti-self-dual eld strength. it couples to anti-self-dual strings in 6d with a string tension
parametrized by a real scalar . there are four more real scalars i which parametrize the position of the
ve-brane in the transverse space. there is also an so(5)r r-symmetry under which , i transform as a
5 and b as a singlet.

in four uncompactied dimensions the ve-brane world volume has to wrap a supersymmetric 2-cycle
c2 in z, that is a holomorphic curve [15][16]. the massless spectrum depends now on the geometry of the
2-cycle c2. the answer can be obtained from the twisting of the world volume theory [16]. it would be
interesting to obtain the general answer. here we restrict to some simple interesting situations. a special

2

supersymmetric twisting for a ve-brane compactied on a curve c(g)
with the result that out of the ve scalars, two become 1-forms on c(g)
this case we get g vector elds from b with one index in the c(g)
and a single anti-symmetric tensor b in four dimensions2.

2

of genus g has been considered in [17]
2 while three remain scalars i. in
direction, as well as 2g + 3 real scalars

2

if g = 1, the normal bundle of c(1)

2

is trivial and the above analysis applies. there are six scalars and

a single vector eld which combine to a n = 4 vector multiplet. this situation is encountered if c(1)

2

is the

ber of the elliptic bration of z. enhancement to su (n ) takes place if n ve-branes coincide.

on the other hand consider the situation where c2 is an isolated genus 0 curve in z. since b is a
singlet, it is unaected by the twisting and must survive, similarly  which still parametrizes the tension
of the four-dimensional string to which b couples. since c2 is isolated there are no further scalars. the
spectrum is that of an n = 1 linear multiplet.

apart from the generic spectrum for generic positions of the ve-branes there will be additional light

degrees of freedom for special values of the moduli. if several ve-branes come close to each other, non-

critical string with a vanishing tension will become relevant, similarly as in six dimensions. in the case of

g > 1, winding states of the string contribute massless vector multiplets, charged with respect to the generic
gauge elds from b as in [17].

another feature is the presence of extra matter in the perturbative heterotic gauge group for a special

alignment of the gauge and geometric moduli [18]. this matter of non-perturbative origin is in addition to

the contribution in (2.3).

elliptically bered calabiyau manifolds z

generally, nding a suitable gauge background v fullling (2.1) and (2.2) explicitly is a very hard ques-

tion, though there is an existence theorem for a solution in the generic case [19]. there is a much better

understanding in the case where z is elliptically bered, basically because it is relatively simple to describe

holomorphic (semi-)stable bundles on a torus e and bering these data in a holomorphic way over a complex

manifold b produces a holomorphic bundle v on the elliptic bration e  z  b. this situation has been

considered in [13][20][21].

in the following we will take a quite dierent route to the subject of holomorphic stable vector bundles

(or rather sheafs) on such n-dimensional calabiyau manifolds zn. we dene them purely in terms of type

iia string theory. the fact that the non-abelian gauge symmetries of type ii arise from d-brane geometries

will lead us to a unied (toric) geometric description of bundles on zn in terms of type iia compactication

geometries.

2 note that it was the non-compactness of c2 in [17] that kills the scalars from 0-forms on c (g)
2 .

3

3. vector bundles and type ii strings

instead of the heterotic string, we will consider now the ten-dimensional type iia string compactied on
calabiyau n + 1-fold singularities. though it is not obvious at rst sight, this theory has the same moduli
space mv of holomorphic stable bundles on a (dierent) calabiyau manifold zn.

we will derive this statement in two steps, for n = 2 and n > 2. for n = 2 we have a relation
between wilson lines on a t 2 and calabiyau 2-fold singularities which follows from a symmetry of the type
iia compactication on k3 t 2 that is closely related to mirror symmetry of k3. in the second step we
use the adiabatic principle [22] and consider holomorphic brations of the 2-fold singularities to construct
calabiyau n + 1-fold singularities related to holomorphic stable bundles on calabiyau zn.

3.1. mirror symmetry on k3 and generalizations

mirror symmetry of k3
consider a type iia string compactied on a k3 surface. this gives an n = 2 supersymmetric theory in
six dimensions. from dimensional reduction we obtain twenty n = 2 vector multiplets which contain as
their bosonic degree of freedom each one vector and four real scalars. the latter transform as a 4 under an
so(4)r r-symmetry and parametrize the 58 metric moduli of k3 plus 22 values of the b-elds on h 2(k3).

in a a given algebraic realization m2 of k3, the 80 moduli of k3 split in complexied kahler and complex
structure moduli3. the so(4)r rotations acting on the scalars in 4 do not preserve this split in general. in
particular there is a so(4)r rotation that exchanges kahler and complex structure moduli spaces mkm and
mcs, respectively. such a transformation is usually known as mirror symmetry of k3 manifolds, which says
that a type iia string compactied on m2 describes the same physics as a type iia string compactication
on a dierent4 k3 manifold w2. the new algebraic k3 surface w2 is called the mirror manifold of m2.
we have the following identications under mirror symmetry:

m2  w2,

mcs(m2)  mkm (w2),

mkm (m2)  mcs(w2).

(3.1)

an extension of mirror symmetry
there is an intriguing generalization of this symmetry upon compactication on a further t 2 to four di-
in this case we obtain a n = 4 supersymmetric string theory. the n = 4 vector multiplet
mensions.
contains now 6 scalars which transform in a 6 of an so(6)r symmetry. the two extra scalars are the inter-
nal components ai of the six-dimensional gauge elds on the t 2, call it e, and thus parametrize the stringy
moduli space of wilson lines on the elliptic curve, mstring
(h). here h denotes the structure group of the
wilson line background. again the so(6)r rotations provide identications within the type iia moduli
space miia(k3  t 2):

e

mkm (m2)  mcs(w2)  mstring

e

(h).

(3.2)

3 subscripts, as in m2, denote the complex dimension of a geometry.
4 since the k3 surface is unique, mirror symmetry is actually a discrete identication in the moduli space of k3

surfaces.

4

in particular there is now an element of so(6)r, corresponding to the last arrow, which provides a relation
between the moduli space of stringy wilson lines with the kahler moduli space of an algebraic k3 manifold.

the dual heterotic picture
let us illustrate the symmetry (3.2) of the type iia compactication on k3 t 2 in the dual heterotic picture
where it is very obvious; however we stress that we do not need the heterotic dual to derive the symmetry.

2  t 2

fig. 1 shows the type iia compactication and the corresponding dual heterotic string compactied on
t 2
3 . the factorization of t 6 is related to i) the elliptic bration and ii) the factorization of the
1  t 2
gauge background on k3 t 2 in the type iia theory. under these circumstances, the kahler moduli of
k3 can be identied with moduli space mt 2
1 and similarly complex
structure moduli with wilson lines in the second factor mt 2
(h2). the non-abelian gauge symmetry in six
dimensions is g which on the type iia side arises from the g singularity and on the heterotic side is the
commutant of h1  h2 in ghet

another factor mt 2

"new"

fig. 1: the symmetry (3.2) from a heterotic point of view.

the heterotic theory has an obvious symmetry under permutation of the three t 2 factors. the exchange of
the rst two tori amounts to mirror symmetry in the type iia theory. on the other hand an exchange that

involves the third torus gives a new symmetry of the moduli space of the type iia compactication that
identies wilson lines with structure group g on t 2 with either kahler or complex deformations of the k3.
this is the new relation described in (3.2).

3.2. the precise correspondence

we want now to use the equivalence (3.2) implied by the so(6)r transformations to describe the moduli
space me(h) of at holomorphic (and non-abelian) h bundles on an elliptic curve in terms of complex
deformations of a geometric type iia compactication. there are a few basic considerations to make precise

such a correspondence. we will not dive into the details here, which can be found in [23][18], but rather
sketch the procedure and state the result.

a) firstly note that the eld theoretical moduli space me(h) contains also the deformations of the torus e.
this is related to the fact that we have to consider gauge backgrounds for the k3  t 2 compactication
which factorize in the sense that they do not restrict the geometry of the t 2 factor.

b) the moduli space mstring

(h) that appears in (3.2) is still that of a theory of wilson lines coupled to
string theory. to obtain the eld theoretical moduli space me we have to decouple the string states
by sending the string scale to innity, mstr  .

e

5

c) the structure group h of the wilson lines on t 2 is contained in the gauge group of the six-dimensional

compactication on m2, which is generically abelian. non-abelian gauge symmetries in six dimensions
arise from charged vector multiplets associated to d2 brane wrappings on 2-cycles ci in m2 [5]. the
masses of these states are  mstr  v ol(ci). therefore light non-abelian vector multiplets are associated

to very small 2-cycles in m2 in the limit mstr  .

the condition a) translates to the property that m2 has to be elliptically bered. conditions b) and

c) are well-known from the geometric engineering of n = 2 quantum eld theories [24]. taking the string

decoupling limit and keeping at the same time the masses of the non-abelian states nite results in a geometric

limit of k3 which is captured by a local singularity of the k3. singularities of k3 at nite distance in the

moduli space are the well-known ade singularities. their local versions are described in terms of ade

singularities of ale spaces.

the local geometry is then of the form of an elliptic bration over the c plane with an h singularity, with

h  ade, at the origin. there are r = rank h 2-spheres ci associated to the blow up of this singularity

which intersect according to an ordinary h dynkin diagram. the elliptic bration implies the existence of

a further 2-sphere c0 associated to the generic homology class of the elliptic ber; the intersections with

the r 2-cycles ci are described by the ane dynkin diagram of h. in summary we arrive at the following

equivalence [23][18]:

o let m2 denote the local neighbourhood of an h singularity in an elliptic bration over the plane. there
are r +1 volumes associated to ck, k = 0, . . . , r which parametrize the kahler moduli space mkm (m2)

of m2. the type iia compactication on m2 describes holomorphic stable h bundles on e with a

moduli space parametrized by the r + 1 kahler moduli of m2:

mkm (m2) = me(h).

(3.3)

applying local mirror symmetry to the geometry m2 we obtain an equivalent description in terms of complex

structure deformations of the mirror geometry w2:

o let w2 denote the (local) mirror of m2. the type iia compactication on w2 describes holomorphic

stable h bundles on e parametrized by the r + 1 complex moduli of m2:

mcs(w2) = me(h).

(3.4)

6

3.3. the complex geometries w2

let us briey summarize the structure of the two-complex dimensional geometries w2 which are the
mirrors of the local ade singularities in the elliptic bration over the plane. we will recover in this way
the results of [13] for those h where a geometric realization of me(h) has been given and reinterpret them
in terms of type iia compactications. moreover we obtain a unied and general geometric formulation for

any h.

the geometry w2 is given as a hypersurface dened by the vanishing of a quasi-homogeneous polynomial

in some variables (y, x, z, v) on a (toric) ambient space. its general form is

pw2 = p0(y, x, z) + p+(y, x, z; v) = p0 +xi=1

vipi

+(y, x, z) = 0,

(3.5)

where we have separated the v independent term p0, and all polynomials are quasi-homogeneous in (y, x, z).
the v independent term p0 is universal for all h and given by

p0 = y2 + x3 + z6 + yxz.

(3.6)

p0 = 0 describes an elliptic curve with complex structure modulus . the v dependent term depends on the
structure group h and has an intriguing group theoretical structure: consider the ane dynkin diagram

(h) associated to the lie group h. then each node in (h) with dynkin index si contributes one monomial
to pi

+(y, x, z). see appendix a for an illustration of this fact.

let us give one simple example. for h = an 1, (an 1) contains n nodes with dynkin index one.

the equation dening w2(an 1) obtained from local mirror symmetry (for n even) is

p0 + v (an zn + an 2zn 2x + an 3zn 3y + . . . + a0xn/2) = 0,

(3.7)

with p0 as above. this denes a two complex dimensional local geometry with a complex structure determined
by the complex parameters , ak. in fact  denes the complex structure of the torus e : p0 = 0 on which
the bundle is dened. the ak are coordinates on the pn 1 predicted in the mathematics literature [25]. it
is well-known, that as far as complex structure is concerned, linear variables in the dening superpotential

can be simply integrated out, which amounts to setting dw/dv = 0 in addition to w = 0. in our case,

varying with respect to v gives p+ = 0 and p0 = 0 separately. this is the zero-dimensional spectral cover
description found in [13].

moreover, from the above construction, we get a similar description for all structure groups h in terms
of complex deformations of a two-dimensional complex geometry w2(h) which is identied as a physical
type iia compactication geometry.

interestingly, we can even describe more sophisticated bundles, such as the spin(32)/z2 bundles with-
out vector structure considered in [26], in terms of two-complex dimensional geometries w2. these bundles
lead to a disconnected set of vacua for the heterotic spin(32)/z2 string, the chl vacua [27] with maxi-
mal supersymmetry but reduced rank of the gauge group. the bundles associated to these vacua can be

constructed in terms of special elliptic brations with reduced monodromy group of the bration [28].

7

3.4. vector bundles on calabiyau n-folds

apart from the satisfying formulation of holomorphic h bundles on a torus, unifying and extending the

results obtained in [13], the real pay-o of the geometric description derives from the type iia compactica-

tion picture. combining the above construction with an adiabatic argument as in [29], we can get local type

iia compactications that describe holomorphic stable vector bundles on calabiyau n-folds in a simple
way. all we have to do is to ber the two-dimensional geometries w2 holomorphically over a n  1 dimen-
sional base bn1, such that the total geometry describes a local patch of a type iia compactication on a
calabiyau n + 1-fold wn+1. the general form of wn+1 is as in (3.5), with the dierence that the complex
parameters dening the complex structure, i.e. , ak in the an 1 case, now get upgraded to sections of line
bundles on the base bn1. in particular the v independent term p0 now describes an elliptically bered
calabiyau n-fold zn, rather than a torus, and p+ denes a family of holomorphic stable bundles on zn.
the ber construction can be done most easily within the framework of toric geometry as will be described

in sect.6.

4. heterotic/type iia and heterotic/f-theory duality

we started the discussion of stable holomorphic vector bundles on calabiyau n-folds in the framework
of heterotic n = 1 string vacua, and arrived at the same physics in the last section using only type iia

physics. in particular we are free to interpret these type iia data as valid classical heterotic vacua. we

thus arrive at the conclusion that the two theories are the same in the proposed limits - the local mirror

limit of type iia and the perturbative low energy limit of heterotic string. this is the classical part of

a conjectured duality of full quantum string theories, namely between type iia on a calabiyau n + 1-fold
wn+1 and heterotic string compactied on a zn  t 2, with zn a calabiyau n-fold. note that we used only
type iia physics to derive our results and therefore proved such an equivalence on the classical level rather

than assuming or using it.

actually we would like to get rid o the t 2 factor on the heterotic side. the fact that we used elliptically
bered geometries5 makes it possible to take what is called the f-theory [7] limit: the limit in which the
kahler class of the elliptic ber shrinks to zero size6. note that this limit can be taken in wn+1 without
interfering with our construction since we concentrated on the complex deformations, rather than the kahler

deformations.

note that the geometric construction of holomorphic stable bundles on calabiyau n-folds zn in terms
of local geometries works for any rank of the structure group h. however precisely if h ts into the
primordial gauge symmetry of the heterotic string, that is e8  e8 or so(32), the local geometries wn+1
can be embedded in global compact calabiyaus wn+1. in this case, from the point of f-theory/heterotic
string duality, we have obtained a systematic way to construct dual pairs: we associate to the calabiyau
n + 1 fold wn+1 used for f-theory compactication the heterotic data of a calabiyau n-fold zn and a
bundle on it (and vice versa).

5 this requires that the mirror geometries w2 of the elliptically bered geometries m2 are also elliptically bered.

this is the case.

6 see also [30].

5. holomorphic stable bundles on elliptic calabiyau manifolds

in the next section we will sketch the precise formulation of the geometric construction of holomorphic

stable bundles on elliptic calabiyau manifolds in terms of toric geometry. before doing that, we outline

some qualitative properties of these bundles and the geometric approach to them.

5.1. some known results

we proceed with an informal collection of some known facts about holomorphic stable vector bundles

on calabiyau manifolds z. the interested reader can nd the details in the literature, as quoted. most of

the concepts in the following sections can be followed without being familiar with the denitions and facts
presented in this paragraph.

 a holomorphic stable bundle v on an elliptic curve e is simply a at bundle on e. it is specied by
a representation of the abelian fundamental group of e in a maximal torus of the structure group h

(assuming the latter is simply connected).

 [25]: the moduli space of at h bundles on a xed e is a weighted projective space wpr

s0,...,sr  w r.
here r = rank h and si are the dynkin indices of the ane dynkin diagram associated to h (see
appendix a.).

 [13]: a geometric realization of the moduli space me of at bundles on e (including the deformations
of e) can be given as follows: for h = an 1, v is specied by n unordered points on the jacobian e
of e (corresponding to the values of the wilson lines in the fundamental representation). if e is given

in weierstrass form

p0 = y2 + 4x3  g2x  g3 = 0,

the n points can be dened as the roots of a degree n polynomial

pc = an + an 2x + an 3y + . . . + a0xn/2 = 0

(5.1)

(5.2)

for n even, the last term being a0yx(n 3)/2 for n odd. the coecients ak parametrize the pn 1
predicted in [25].

for h = ek, k = 6, 7, 8, a geometric description can be obtained from del pezzo surfaces dpk. e.g.,

for k = 8, the equation

y2 =4x3  g2xv4  g3v6 + (6u6 + 5u5v + 4u4v2 + 3u3v3 + 2u2v4)

+ x(4u4 + 3u3v + 2u2v2 + 1uv3),

(5.3)

describes a del pezzo surface obtained from blowing up eight points in p2. the elliptic curve is identied
with the hyperplane u = 0. the coecients k, k parametrize the wp8
1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,6 predicted in [25].

 [13]: holomorphic stable bundles on elliptically bered calabiyau manifold z can be described by
bering the data (e, w r) holomorphically over a complex base b. the non-trivial bration of the torus
e over b builds up the calabiyau n-fold zn. similarly, the projective spaces w r t into a holomorphic
bundle w r over b. if s : b  w r is a section, the homogeneous coordinates ai of w r pull back to
sections

ai  h 0(b, n si  ldi),

(5.4)

9

where l is the anti-canonical bundle of b and n a line bundle on b which is an important characteristic
of v and is closely related to the higher chern classes of v . the dj are the degrees of the independent
casimir operators of the group h and si the dynkin indices as above. part of the data of v are dened
by choosing a section of w r.

the space y of sections of w r is the base of the moduli space of holomorphic at bundles over z;

the ber data include additional continous and discrete data related to certain twistings of v 7.

a universal abstract construction of v , the so-called parabolic construction, has been given in terms
of deformations of unstable bundles. the method is so far restricted to bundles that are invariant under
the involution y  y on the ber and have c3(v ) = 0.

 [13]: chern classes of v have been calulated in the parabolic and spectral cover approach for h =

su (n ):

c2(v ) =

(n    + n c1(b)) is a certain class in h 1,1(c, z) which fullls  = 0. here c is the spectral cover
described by an equation of the form (5.2) with ai replaced by ai as in (5.4) and moreover   z/2.

the third chern class c3(v ) has been determined in [33][32]:

c3(v ) = 2(  n c1(b)).

(5.6)

5.2. the geometric approach

the geometric type ii string approach improves in various aspects the previous understanding and use

of holomorphic stable bundles and heterotic/f-theory duality. we will obtain

 a canonical description of at bundles v on a torus e in terms of two-complex dimensional type iia
compactication geometries, provided by a map f : w2  (e, v ). this unies the results of [13] for
an and ek and generalizes to any structure group h.

 more generally we obtain a map f : wn+1  (zn, v ) that assigns to a local calabiyau n + 1-fold
wn+1 an elliptically bered calabiyau n-fold zn together with a family of holomorphic stable vector
bundles v on it.

 all objects will be dened within the framework of toric geometry. dierently than in the methods
summarized above, singularities in the elliptic bration of zn and sheaf generalizations of v are auto-
matically taken care of in the toric formulation.

 on the practical side, the method allows us to freely engineer bundles (sheafs) on any elliptically bered
calabiyau manifold zn. the dening data, such as the structure group h, the manifold zn and
characteristic classes of v have an extremely simple representation in terms of the toric polyhedron
associated to the geometry wn.

 interpreting the data (zn, v ) in terms of the heterotic string, one obtains valid n = 1 vacua that solve
(2.2)(2.4). the coincidence of the type iia physics on wn and heterotic string on (zn, v ) is related
to the conjectured non-perturbative type iia/heterotic and f-theory/heterotic string dualities. we use

additional singularities in the construction.

classical type iia physics to derive this equivalence, rather than assuming it. this elucidates type

iia/heterotic duality and f-theory/heterotic duality at the classical level.

 extending the map f in a global context f : wn+1  (zn, v ) provides a systematic identication of

dual pairs of f-theory/heterotic duality.

 important data of the bundle v , such as the line bundle n , stability of v as well as non-perturbative

ve-branes, have a very transparent interpretation in the toric formulation.

6. toric geometry: a do-it-yourself kit for (non-perturbative) heterotic n = 1 vacua

after outlining the conceptual framework in the previous sections, we want now to describe a concrete
recipe, how to dene and construct the complex manifold wn+1 such that it describes a chosen heterotic
calabiyau zn and a gauge background v on it8. we will dene the dual pair wn+1 and (zn, v ) within
the framework of toric geometry, which for many purposes is the most useful and general description of

calabiyau manifolds. we will see that toric geometry is also quite suited to describe vector bundles on
calabiyaus 9.

the toric construction of the local geometries is described in [18] and we will not repeat the details here.

however the toric description has some very simple and graphical aspects which we want to sketch here.

actually we can formulate a set of quite simple rules using the language of toric polyhedra. in particular
we will see how the physical quantities, such as the structure group h, the heterotic manifold zn, data of
the characteristic classes of v appearing in [13], singularities of the gauge background as well as associated

non-perturbative ve-brane wrappings are encoded in a toric polyhedron.

in a nutshell, toric geometry describes a k dimensional calabiyau geometry mk by a k + 1 dimensional
i dened in a standard
k+1 of codimension larger than one denes a divisor
k+1, there must be r  k  1

polyhedron 
k + 1 dimensional lattice. each vertex 
(holomorphic hypersurface) in mk. note that because of the dimension of 
linear relations l(m)

between the r (external) vertices

i } of r integral vertices 

i on a face of 

l(m)

i = 0, m = 1, . . . , h1,1.

xi

(6.1)

in fact h1,1 = r  k  1 is the number of kahler moduli of mk.

now choose the elliptically bered heterotic calabiyau n-fold zn with base  : zn  bn1 of the
zn . the guideline to construct families of

bration. to zn corresponds an n + 1 dimensional polyhedron 
holomorphic stable bundles on zn in terms of toric geometry is then as follows [18]:

1. the structure group h:

choose the structure group h. the polyhedron 
3 for the geometry w2(h) and, if existing, a global
embedding w2(h) is given in [23][18]. the perturbative gauge symmetry of the heterotic string is the
commutant of h in e8  e8.

8 since we consider structure groups h which are embeddable in the heterotic gauge group we will treat the local

version wn+1 and the global embedding wn+1 on the same footing in the following.

9 a fact that has been noticed already in the formulation of (0, 2) linear sigma models [10].

11

2. the base geometry:

the toric base of the elliptic bration bn1 is described by a toric polyhedron 
[18].

bn1 as given e.g. in

3. the bration w2  wn+1  bn1:

to the heterotic compactication manifold zn corresponds a n + 1 dimensional polyhedron 
appears as a projection in 
bered geometries implies [34] that 

zn . it

this concludes the description of the geometrical data of the heterotic compactication10.

5. perturbative bundle data: xing the line bundle n on bn1:

the above conditions do not x 
wn+1 completely: there are many n + 2 dimensional vertices that
project to the n + 1 dimensional vertices of 
zn in the above construction. this freedom is related to
perturbative and non-perturbative data associated to the gauge background v . let us rst consider the
perturbative data. according to [13], the denition of v includes the specication of a line bundle n
on bn1. the class  = c1(n ) enters the chern classes c2(v ) and c3(v ) as in (5.5)(5.6).

wn+1. recall also that 

wn+1 is required to be convex. making a minimal choice of vertices {

in the toric framework, line bundles are related to the linear relations (6.1) between the vertices of

i }, such
that 
wn+1 fulls the conditions 1.-4., and moreover is convex, determines obviously the linear relations
(6.1) of the vertices in 
wn+1 and thus in particular the line bundles on bn1. specically it turns
out that there are only two line bundles that determine the bration of the two complex-dimensional
geometries w2 over bn1, namely the anti-canonical bundle l of bn1 and one additional line bundle
which is equivalent to n of ref.[13].

thus determining the bundle data n , translates in the toric polyhedra to a simple linear relation

10 note that there can be obstructions to give all curves in zn a nite size; this phenomenon is related to non-

perturbative gauge symmetries [18].

12

of the vertices in 
wn+1. in fact the denition in toric geometry is more general in the sense that it
applies to any singularities in the geometry or the gauge background. an interesting fact is that the
convexity of 
wn+1 restricts the possible linear relations and thus the range of acceptable line bundles
n . in six dimensions this phenomenon describes the well-known stability properties of instantons on

k3 and we expect a similar interpretation in four dimensions. a general bound on the rst chern class
 = c1(n ) is given by

(g) c1(l)   ( 12c1(l) ),

(6.4)

where g is the singularity type of the ber geometry w2 and (g) is a certain characteristic number
dened in [35] explicit expressions n for toric bases, such as p2 and fn and blow ups thereof, can
also be found in [18]. see also ref.[36] for an independent discussion of the class  in terms of toric
polyhedra11.

6. non-perturbative bundle data i: gauge symmetries :

after xing h, zn and the line bundle n , there is still a freedom to add vertices to 
wn+1 . this
freedom corresponds to introducing singularities in the behavior of v that are related to non-perturbative

physics of the heterotic string. specically we can introduce singularities in the elliptic bration of
wn+1 located over a divisor of bn1. gauge symmetry enhancement follows from the physics of the
type iia/f-theory compactication on wn+1 [8]. in the heterotic picture these gauge symmetries are
non-perturbative. amazingly, the simple requirement of convexity of 
wn+1 gives an almost complete
information about the possible complicated non-perturbative gauge symmetries, e.g. in the case of ve-

branes at singularities [12]. we will describe some singularities of the heterotic bundle associated to

this non-perturbative gauge enhancements in the next section.

7. non-perturbative bundle data ii: non-perturbative ve-branes :

we can also blow up the base bn of the elliptic bration of wn+1. it is a p1 bundle over the heterotic
base bn1.
in the six dimensional case, corresponding to n = 1 and a k3 compactication of the
heterotic string, blow ups of the p1 bration have been identied as non-perturbative heterotic 5 branes
lling space time and located at points of the k3 [8]. the story in four dimensions is similar [18], with
the dierence that the ve-branes are now wrapped on holomorphic spheres c in bn1 specied by
the position of the blow-up12. for c a genus zero curve the universal spectrum from the ve-branes
is an n = 1 tensor multiplet l. it couples to a non-critical string in four dimensions. this is a quite

interesting object from the point of supersymmetric n = 1 particle physics. in particular the string
tension can be classically zero but acquires a small, non-perturbatively generated tension  2 at the
quantum level [37], very similarly as the non-perturbative mass of the w  bosons in the n = 2 su (2)
seibergwitten model. it would be interesting to study their implication for standard particle physics

below the scale .

this concludes our recipe for the construction of the heterotic n = 1 vacuum. the precise information about

which toric vertices implement the points 1.-7. can be found in [18]. it is striking how simple toric concepts,
such as convexity of 
wn+1 , contain interesting physics. moreover singularities, both of the geometry zn
and the bundle v can be easily introduced in the toric language. however we should also mention that there

11 the bound on  derived in [36] is dierent from (6.4).
12 see also ref. [36] for a discussion of these ve-branes.

13

are few additional data of v [13] which are not encoded in the simple toric description above. it would be

interesting to have a generalization that contains them.

note that apart from the classical geometric formulation of (families of) holomorphic stable gauge

backgrounds on zn, we can think of the correspondence wn+1  (zn, v ) as a dual pair and assume, use

- or possibly verify - duality of the quantum theories, to study quantum and non-perturbative phenomena

(as we did in fact already, when we used f-theory to infer non-perturbative heterotic phenomena). some

interesting directions that have been considered include correlation functions and the n = 1 superpotential.

see refs. [38] for examples.

7. some results

let us nally sketch some results on (non-perturbative) heterotic physics which have been obtained in

[18] using the above method.

7.1. standard embedding

a simple solution to the equations (2.1),(2.2) is to set the gauge connection equal to the spin connection

of the manifold, v = t z. though this conguration is not too appealing for phenomenology - the heterotic

gauge group is e6  e8 and the matter spectrum is tied to the euler number of z - it has been studied

extensively in the past because it was one of the few known solutions. the structure group of v is then

su (n) for a calabiyau n-fold, and the local geometry described by an equation of the form (3.7).

the global geometry wn+1 corresponding to the f-theory dual can be determined in the following way.

from the fact that the bundle in the second factor is trivial it follows that the line bundle n discussed in

sect.6 is trivial in the second e8 factor. the weierstrass form for wn+1 and zn takes the following form:

pzn = y2 + x3 + xz4f + z6g,
pwn = y2 + x3 + x(zzw)4f + (zzw)6g + z6z5w7 + z6z7w5.

(7.1)

here (z, w) denote the variables parametrizing the base p1 of the elliptically bered k3 ber w2 of the
bration f : wn+1  bn1 and  = 4f 3 + 27g2 is the discriminant of the elliptic bration of zn. this

generalizes the six-dimensional result obtained in [39] to four and lower dimensions.

14

7.2. non-perturbative gauge symmetries

in the f-theory picture gauge symmetries correspond to singularities in the elliptic bration. those
located over the base bn1 have a perturbative interpretation in the heterotic dual, whereas non-perturbative
ones are located over curves in bn1 [8]. using the map wn+1  (zn, v ) we can associate the heterotic
compactication that creates the same dynamics non-perturbatively . in the six-dimensional case we nd:

() consider the e8  e8 string compactied on an elliptically bered k3 with a singularity of type g
at a point s = 0 and a special gauge background v . if the restriction of the spectral cover 13 of v|e
to the ber e at s = 0 is suciently trivial, the heterotic string acquires a non-perturbative gauge
symmetry gnp  g.

the triviality condition can be made precise by specifying the behavior of v near s = 0 [18]. similar results
hold for four-dimensional compactications.

we point out that the above triviality condition on the spectral cover does not imply that the eld
strength of v , which measures the behavior of v near the singularity, is trivial. in fact it has been shown
recently in [40] that if f = 0 on the singularity, the conformal eld theory of the heterotic string is well
behaved and there is no non-perturbative gauge symmetry.

7.3. non-perturbative dualities

our map f : wn+1  (zn, v ) can be ambiguous in the sense that there are two (or even more) ways
wn+1. if the two maps are compatible with the same elliptic bration, we

to associated a pair (zn, v ) to 
obtain a non-perturbative duality of two heterotic string theories

(zn, v )  (z 

n, v ).

(7.2)

the conditions under which this duality exists, can be formulated in simple properties of the polyhedron

wn+1 )
[18]. the generic form of the duality is the following:

wn+1 associated to wn+1 (essentially the existence of appropriate hyperplanes and projections in 

() let the heterotic string be compactied on a calabiyau three-fold with g singularity and with
a certain gauge background with structure group h such that the toric data 
wn+1 full the above
mentioned condition. then there exists a non-perturbatively equivalent compactication on a calabi
yau manifold with g singularity and with a specic gauge background with structure group h .

here h (h ) is the commutant of g (g) in e8  e8. note that the duality exchanges the groups of the
geometric singularity and the gauge bundle: the singularity in the dual manifold is the commutant of the
structure group and vice versa. let us give an extreme example of such an duality: the heterotic string
with a trivial gauge bundle on a smooth k3 has a perturbative e8  e8 gauge symmetry and in addition
n
t = 24 non-perturbative tensor multiplets from the 24 ve-branes required to satisfy (2.5). the dual theory
is a heterotic theory with e8  e8 gauge bundle on a k3 with e8  e8 singularity. the perturbative gauge
symmetry is trivial, while non-perturbative dynamics associated to the singularity produce both, the e8 e8
gauge symmetry as well as 24 extra tensor multiplets.

this duality reminds very much of a known duality in the linear sigma model formulation of heterotic
strings, namely a symmetry of the formulation under the exchange of the data dening the manifold and
the data dening the bundle [41]. however note that in our case this duality is in general non-perturbative.

13 for g 6= su (n ) we use the generalizations of the spectral cover discussed previously.

15

7.4. mirror symmetry of f-theory

consider a six-dimensional f-theory compactication on w3 and the associated heterotic dual (z2, v )
as dened above. if the mirror manifold m3 of w3 is also elliptically bered, there is also a heterotic theory
(z 
2, v ) associated to it and one can ask the question of how the two theories are related. the answer is that
after compactication on a three-torus to three dimensions, the two become equivalent in virtue of mirror

symmetry of type ii strings [42].

a proposal for the relation between (z2, v ) and (z 

2, v ) has been made in [43] based on a comparison
of hodge numbers and gauge symmetries in some cases. using the toric map wn+1  (zn, v ) one can derive
the two theories; in fact one nds a subtle realization of higgs and coulomb branches in toric geometry as
expected from the action of three-dimensional mirror symmetry [18]. the general relation is of a similar
form as in () above: a heterotic theory with a g bundle compactied on a k3 manifold with h singularity
gets mapped to a heterotic theory with a bundle with structure group h compactied on a manifold with
g singularity. note that we have an explicit map of the moduli spaces of the two theories. it would be
interesting to formulate the associated three-dimensional dual pairs associated to this relation, as in [44].

8. outlook

in these lectures we have reviewed a construction of a certain class of calabiyau geometries wn+1 and,
if possible, their compact embeddings wn+1. in a certain limit of the type iia string compactied on wn+1
we obtain the physics of holomorphic, stable vector bundles (or sheaves) v on a calabiyau manifold zn.
interpreting the data (zn, v ) as a valid classic heterotic vacuum establishes f-theory/heterotic duality at a
classical level. in the toric construction, we have a well-dened toric map f : wn+1  (v, zn) that allows
for a systematic construction of dual pairs in both directions.

the identications between wn+1 and (zn, v ) may serve as a starting point to study more rened
non-perturbative relations between the dual f- and heterotic string theory. in particular we would like to
formulate both, perturbative and non-perturbative quantities of the heterotic string, e.g. gauge and yukawa
couplings of the (0, 2) vacua, in terms of geometric quantities on wn+1, such as the correlation functions
determined by period integrals considered in [37]. in the ideal (and supposedly too optimistic) case, we can
hope to obtain exact results for at least some of the holomorphic physical quantities in the n = 1 theory
from geometric information on wn+1, similarly as it happened to work in the case of n = 2 supersymmetry
[6][45][24].
