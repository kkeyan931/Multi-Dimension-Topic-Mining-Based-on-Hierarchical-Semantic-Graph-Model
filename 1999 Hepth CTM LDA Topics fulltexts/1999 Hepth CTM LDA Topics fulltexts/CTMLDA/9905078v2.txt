in this note we discuss d-branes on t 4/z2 using the boundary states formalism. explicit
formulas for the untwisted boundary states inherited from the underlying t 4 and twisted

states corresponding to branes wrapping collapsed 2-cycles at the orbifold singularities

are given. the exact cft description of the orbifold makes it possible to study how
the boundary states transform under ri 7 1
transformation on all directions of the
underlying t 4. we compare their transformation law with results obtained from world

ri

volume considerations.

1. introduction

starting in [1], d-branes transverse to c2/zn orbifolds have been discussed exten-
sively in the literature. much less has been said about d-branes moving in curved compact

backgrounds and on compact orbifold backgrounds, or even general cft backgrounds.

(see however [2] and [3,4,5] which discuss d-branes in gepner models.) in this paper, we
will study the toroidal orbifold t 4/z2. this model has been studied from the point of
view of world volume theories of d-branes in [6,7,8]. here, a dierent point of view will

be taken, namely, we will construct boundary states for the d-branes. this approach goes

back to the work of cardy in the context of rational conformal eld theory [9]. let us

briey describe the main ideas of this work.

the cft description of open strings involves riemann surfaces with boundaries as

world sheets, e.g. the strip or the upper half plane. in the interior, the theory behaves

like a theory on the full plane. the physics on the boundary depends on the boundary

conditions imposed there. consider a bulk theory realizing two isomorphic left and right-

moving chiral algebras. on the boundary the left and right-moving generators must be

related by an automorphism of the chiral algebra, otherwise the corresponding symmetry

will not be preserved. in particular, since no energy is allowed to ow across the boundary,
the operators t (z) and t (z) must be identied on the boundary.

these boundary conditions can be transformed to the closed string sector.

in this

language, the boundary conditions are implemented on boundary states, as given in [10].

however, for a consistent boundary state modular invariance imposes additional condi-

tions. to see this, consider an open string one-loop amplitude, i.e. the world sheet is a

cylinder. alternatively, this diagram can be viewed as a closed string tree-level amplitude

between boundary states. this leads to the condition, that the modular transformation of

a transition amplitude between boundary states leads to an open string partition function,

in particular, a sum of characters with integer coecients (cardys condition).

the plan of this paper is as follows. in the next section we establish our conventions

and notations by reviewing supersymmetric boundary states on tori. our discussion will

be brief and the reader is referred to [11,12] for a more complete treatment. the twisted

and untwisted orbifold boundary states are then constructed in section 3 where we also

discuss their spacetime interpretation.

in section 4, we discuss t-duality on a t 4/z2 orbifold. more precisely, we consider a
transformation t , which acts on the untwisted sector of the orbifold theory as the ri 7 1

ri

1

transformation along all four circles of the underlying t 4. we point out that if t acts
on the twist elds as a certain unitary transformation, it preserves the 3-point functions
and is therefore a symmetry of the cft. the action of t on the boundary states is then
compared with a transformation given in [6] acting on the bps vectors of the orbifold limit

of type iia on k3. we nd agreement between the two. in the last section we discuss our

results.

2. boundary states in toroidal compactications

let us briey review the construction of boundary states [13,14] in a toroidal back-
ground where x6, . . . , x9 are compactied with radii r6, . . . , r9. to avoid introducing (su-
per)ghosts, we will work in the light-cone gauge as in [15] and consider dirichlet boundary

conditions localizing the d-branes at the origin of all non-compact directions. the light-

cone boundary conditions mean that we we will eectively describe p+1-instantons instead

of p-branes, but these are related by a double wick rotation. the problem at hand is con-
structing the nsns and rr sector boundary states |dp; ; ~kii n sn s

where ,  the neumann directions and i, j label the dirichlet ones. the vector k denotes

the continuous momenta carried by the bosonic fock vacuum in the non-compact directions
x2, . . . , x5 and the discrete momentum or winding quantum numbers in the compact direc-
tions x6, . . . , x9. the parameter  = 1 reects the freedom of choosing a spin structure
on the cylinder [14].

in the bosonic sector the equations (2.1) are solved by the coherent state

in particular, the zero mode equations are solved in the dirichlet directions by vacua
|b; nii carrying momenta ni
and in the neumann directions by vacua |b; mi carrying

winding 2mr. the states (2.2) are not yet consistent boundary states in the sense of
cardy, since the tree level amplitudes between them do not transform under the s-modular

transformation into open string partition functions.

in order to obtain the correct d-brane states it is necessary to localize the branes in

the dirichlet directions and assign denite wilson lines in the neumann directions. this

is done by fourier transforming with respect to the positions xi and the wilson lines x.
the correct boundary state for a dp-brane sitting at the origin in the external dimensions

is therefore given by

|bp; xi =z 5yl=0

9y=7+ppr xmz

(2.3)

where x encodes both xi and x. for completeness and later use, the tree level transition
amplitude between two parallel p-branes is then given by

it can be checked that (2.4) and (2.5) are related by s-modular transformation as required.

observe that the dierence x the parameters encoding the positions and wilson lines

leads to a shift of the ground state energy of the dierent open string sectors as expected.

as in the bosonic case, the fermionic conditions in (2.1) are solved by coherent

fermionic states

(2.6)

in the nsns sector |fg.s.in sn s = |0i is the unique ground state and has no  dependence.
in the rr sector, |fg.s.irr must also solve the zero mode equations in (2.1), and there-
fore depends non-trivially on . the dierent zero mode solutions encode p-brane of all

dimension p = 1, . . . , 4 as indicated in (2.1) [16].

the action of the fermionic number operator on the dierent states (2.6) is given by

(1)f|f p; in sn s = |f p; in sn s
(1)f|f p; irr = (1)7p|f p; irr

(1)
(1)

f|f p; in sn s = |f p; in sn s
f|f p; irr = |f p; irr

(2.7)

it follows that the gso invariant boundary states are

|f pin sn s =

|f pirr =

1
2
1
2

(|f p; +in sn s  |f p; in sn s )

(|f p; +irr + |f p; irr) ,

(2.8)

where p is even in type iia theory and odd in type iib.

by world sheet duality, the transition amplitude between the gso projected boundary

states reproduces the ns and r sectors of the open string partition function. the same

reasoning also shows that the transition amplitude between two (nsns) rr boundary
states becomes the open string partition function with (no) (1)f inserted. an explicit
calculation gives the correct supersymmetric p-brane state as

|dp; xi = |bp; xi 

1
2

(|f pin sn s  4i|f pirr) .

(2.9)

the rr charges of a d-brane are determined by saturating the boundary state with the

corresponding rr vertex operator as in [16]. by convention, the + sign above is taken to
be a brane and the  sign to an anti-brane.

3. dp-branes on the z2 orbifold

in this section d-branes on toroidal orbifolds are studied in the boundary state lan-

guage. previous work in a similar direction has appeared in [17,18] see also [12,19] for a

discussion in the context of non-bps but stable states.

from open string considerations it is well known that there are dierent types of d-

branes on orbifolds, depending on the representation of the orbifold group chosen on the

chan-paton factors [1,22]. on a z2 orbifold there is the regular representation and one-
dimensional representations. the resulting d-branes dier physically in their rr-charges:

4

while the regular representation leads to a brane which is only charged under untwisted

sector elds, the one-dimensional representations give d-branes which are charged under

both twisted and untwisted sector rr-elds. in the boundary state language this means

that the former type of brane contains only ishibashi states built over untwisted sector

primary elds, whereas the latter contains an ishibashi state built over a twist eld. there-

fore, we refer to them as untwisted and twisted branes respectively. in this section we

will discuss both untwisted and twisted d0-branes in detail, whereas part of the discussion

of the higher dimensional branes is postponed to a later section.

3.1. the untwisted states

the untwisted boundary states are z2 invariant combinations of the t 4 boundary

states. the orbifold action reverses the sign of both the fermionic and bosonic oscillators

in the a = 6, . . . , 9 directions:

a
n  a

n, a

r  a
r ,

and the action on the rr vacua given by

|fg.s.irr 

2a

0

9ya=6

9ya=6

2 a

0|fg.s.irr .

(3.1)

(3.2)

the rr vacua, on which the even dimensional branes are built, are invariant under this

action as can be veried using the conditions (2.1). moreover, odd dimensional bps branes

in the orbifold directions are projected out as required by the homology of a k3 surface.

using this, we see that the full boundary state transforms as

|dp; xi  |dp; xi,

leading to the invariant states

|dp; xiorb =

1
2

(|dp; xi + |dp; xi) .

(3.3)

(3.4)

the states (3.4) are built only over untwisted vacua and for this reason are charged under
the untwisted rr elds as the t 4 states. the computation of the transition amplitudes

5

between two such boundary states is reduced to a computation in the unorbifolded theory.

for example the transition amplitude of a boundary state with itself is

(3.5)

the relevant amplitudes for the torus were given in the previous section. as expected, the

s-modular transformation of this result leads to an open string partition function with

the regular representation on the chan-paton factors. the rst two terms in this sum

are equal to each other and so are the last two. they correspond respectively to strings

stretching between a d-brane and itself and strings stretching between a d-brane and its
if the d-branes are away from the xed points 1, only the rst two terms can

image.

lead to marginal operators, with the corresponding moduli being the position and wilson
line of the brane. at the xed point x = x, there are additional marginal operators
coming from the last two terms in the sum (3.5). these arise from external directions to

the orbifold, and in the d0-brane world volume theory signal a coulomb branch opening

[1,22]. the new massless elds arising from the internal directions are gauge equivalent to

the marginal operators already in the theory.

the bps property and the rr charges carried by (3.4) are crucial in correctly iden-

tifying these states with spacetime d-branes. the state with p = 0 is a d0-brane which

can move anywhere inside the orbifold. it carries one unit of d0-brane charge, and has

four position moduli. the state with p = 2 corresponds to a d2-brane wrapping once one
of the six t 2 cycles inherited from the underlying t 4. this assignment again xes the

absolute normalization of the d2-brane charge. their moduli are equally well understood
as transverse position and wilson line. this can be seen by regarding t 4/z2 as an elliptic
bration over a base p1 with four d4 singular bers. the inherited 2-cycles which the
d2-branes wrap are elliptic curves with respect to a properly chosen complex structure,

and have one complex deformation. these four moduli account respectively for the two

x and two xi parameters which appear in the boundary state. the state with p = 4 is a
state carrying only d4-brane charge wrapping the orbifold. we will discuss its physics in

the section on t-duality.

1 the term xed point has been used somewhat loosely, since the parameters for the neu-

mann directions are wilson lines.

6

3.2. the twisted case

let us now turn to the twisted boundary states, generalizing the discussion of the
bosonic s1/z2 orbifold in [20]. the 16 xed points of the orbifold are located on points
in 1
2 w , where w denotes the winding lattice. therefore it is natural to label the bosonic
twist elds t[v] by cosets [v], where v  1
2 w . each of the 16 twisted vacua |t[v]i produces
an all dirichlet coherent state

|dt[v]ii = exp{

1
n

xn= 1

2

i
n i

n}|t[v]i.

(3.6)

taking into account the fermions, we note that in the twisted nsns (rr) sector the

moding of the fermions is (half) integral, and hence there is a unique twisted rr ground

state. however, there are fermionic zero modes in the nsns orbifold directions. the

twisted nsns ground state, which fullls the zero-mode part of (2.1) must be picked by

the same considerations as for the rr ground state on the torus.

the rr ishibashi state leads to a charge under the corresponding rr vertex operator,

implying that the ishibashi state should correspond to d2-brane wrapped on a collapsed

sphere at a xed point. it is known from the gauge theory analysis that these d2-branes

also carry one half unit of d0-brane charge induced by the b-eld on the collapsed cy-

cles. in cft language this is reected in the requirement of modular invariance. let us

consider open strings starting and ending at the same xed point with chan paton fac-

tors transforming in the trivial representation of the z2 orbifold group. the open string

partition function with the z2 generator g inserted reproduces the amplitude between a

twisted ishibashi state and itself. the other part of the open string partition function

gives a d0-brane amplitude. the coecients of the twisted and untwisted parts are xed

by the bosonic open string partition function given by

z b

(3.7)

this shows that in the purely bosonic case the correct fractional d0-brane boundary states

are given by

|b0b2[v]i = 2 1

2 |b0; vi  2
7

1

2 |bt[v]ii.

(3.8)

it can be checked that these states are mutually consistent among themselves. note that

position of the untwisted part is determined by the twisted part. all other combinations

are ruled out by consistency with twisted d4-brane states which we will discuss later. in

the full supersymmetric theory there are a-priori eight dierent states associated to each

of the xed points corresponding to eight possible relative signs. however, only the

|d0d2[v]i+,

|d0d2[v]i+,

|d0d2[v]i,

|d0d2[v]i.

(3.9)

have a consistent superstring interpretation [21].

4. t-duality on the orbifold

4.1. the t-duality action on the twist elds

in this section we work out a consistent action of the inherited t-duality transfor-
mation t on the twist elds of a t d/z2 orbifold. similar calculations were done in [26,23].
we take the underlying t d to be a rectangular torus with radii ri and with no b-eld

turned on. as is well known the spectrum and interactions of the untwisted sector are
invariant under t , and we therefore limit our discussion to the twisted sector.

sector is ht = ht = d

consider rst the bosonic sector of a superstring cft. the highest weight of a twisted
16 . thus, in order to preserve the spectrum, the action of t can only
map twist elds into a linear combination of twist elds. we will now determine the exact

map by requiring the three point functions involving twist elds to be invariant. this
implies that both the spectrum and interactions are invariant, so that t is a symmetry of
the theory.

on the t d torus with no b-eld the momentum lattice m and the winding lattice

w decouple. we denote z2-invariant combinations of untwisted sector vertex operators

carrying momentum p and winding w in these lattices as vp,w. the ope of two twist

elds in a z2 orbifold of this torus was given in [24,25] as follows. the topological selection

rule for these amplitudes are very easily seen from the winding lattice.

8

fig. 1: fusion of a twisted string and a winding string

the gure above illustrates the joining of a twisted string t[v] with a winding string

vp,w. the result has to be a twisted string around the xed point [v + 1
of the four point amplitude of twist elds gives the exact coecients in the ope

(4.1)

the transformation t exchanges winding and momentum, and therefore must also act on
the twist elds in order to preserve the ope (4.1). as we show in the appendix, this is

achieved by the transformation

t[v] = 2 d

2 x[v] 1

2 w/w

(1)4vv

t[v]

(4.2)

and therefore t is a symmetry of the bosonic orbifold cft. note that v  1
the inner product v  v above is well dened.

2 m , so that

the supersymmetric case is restricted to d = 4 orbifolds by the z2 action, but presents
no new subtleties. the transformation of the twisted nsns, rr, nsr or rns world sheet
fermions under t is identical to that of the untwisted rr, nsns, rns or nsr fermions
respectively. it follows that t with the usual action on the untwisted sector and the action
(4.2) on the twisted sector is a symmetry of perturbative superstrings compactied on this
t 4/z2 orbifold.

it will prove convenient later to adopt an alternative numbering scheme for the twist

elds. there is a natural correspondence between the conjugacy class [v] of each of the 16

xed points and four-digit binary numbers b, such that the origin is assigned to 0000 and
so forth. we relabel a twist eld t[v] by ta, where a = 16  b. in this notation the action
(4.2) of t on the twist elds is represented by the 16  16 matrix

taa =(cid:18) 1

(4.3)

4.2. the world volume analysis

in order to compare the previous results with the transformation [6] obtained by world

volume analysis, let us briey recall some relevant facts about type iia theory compactied
on a t 4/z2 limit of k3. the total integral cohomology of k3 forms the lattice 4,20 [29],
whose basis vectors are associated to spacetime bps states. the inner product on this

lattice is the oriented intersection number of the corresponding cycles of k3. it is natural
to work with orthogonal decomposition of this lattice 4,20 = 3,19  1,1 corresponding to
h (k3, z) = h 2(k3, z) h 0(k3, z) h 4(k3, z). in this decomposition, the sub-lattice
1,1 is spanned by vectors  and  generating h 4(k3, z) and h 0(k3, z) respectively
over the integers; their intersection form is given by

   =    = 0

   = 1.

(4.4)

although there exists a basis for 3,19 generating h 2(k3, z) over the integers, in the
orbifold limit it proves more convenient to work with a dierent one. the elements of this
basis are i, 
i , i = 1, 2, 3 corresponding to the 6 inherited two-cycles from the underlying
t 4 and a, a = 1, . . . , 16 representing the 16 collapsed spheres at the xed points of the
z2 action. the non-trivial part of their intersection matrix is given by

j = 2ij

i  
a  b = 2ab

.

(4.5)

the basis (4.5), known as the kummer basis, generates h 2(k3, z) over q, but over
the integers only an index two sub-lattice of 3,19 [30]. observe also that in (4.5) the
background b-eld needed for a perturbative description of the orbifold takes the form

b = 

1
4

16xa=1

a.

it is important to keep in mind that the mukai charges of a point

p = q0 + q2 + q4,

(4.6)

(4.7)

in the 4,20 lattice are not the d0, d2 and d4-brane charges as seen by a low energy
observer. the latter are shifted due to the background b-eld [31], and are given by

q4 = q4
q2 = q2  q4b
q0 = q0 + q2  b 

1
2

q4b2,

10

(4.8)

where q0 already includes the shift due to the k3 curvature, i.e. it is the instanton number
of the bundle minus its rank.

in [6], a k3 duality was formulated, which has the property that it maps the pertur-

bative orbifold t 4/z2 to an orbifold of the dual torus et 4/z2. this means in particular

that the b-eld on the collapsed two-cycles is preserved. the volume of the covering

spaces is inverted, meaning that the volume of the orbifold gets mapped to 1/4 of the

inverse volume. a theory of d0 and d2-branes on the original orbifold is mapped to the

theory of d4-branes and other brane charges on the dual orbifold. concretely, the gauge

theory analysis of the theory of d4-branes wrapping the dual et 4/z2 torus in [6] led to the

following transformation of the kummer lattice generators and , :

i = 1, 2, 3

the asymmetry in the transformation of 16 is due to the arbitrary assignment of 16 to
the collapsed 2-cycle at the origin. the elements da are given by

(4.11)

4.3. action on the branes

in the boundary state formalism, the t-duality transformation on the untwisted

boundary states is straight-forward. it converts dirichlet into neumann boundary con-
ditions and vice versa, so that an untwisted |dp; xi state is mapped to an untwisted
|d(4  p); xi state. here, x refers to the dual moduli. in particular, the untwisted d0-
brane transforms into a state which carries only untwisted d4-brane charge as seen by a

low energy observer.

since we identify the bps vector  with the untwisted d0-brane state, the p = 4 state

should be identied with the transform of  under (4.9). as evidence for this identication

11

we can compute the rr charges carried by this bps vector. using (4.8), its d0 and d2-

brane charges vanish as they should. however the world volume analysis leads to twice

the fundamental d4-brane charge. this is because under t-duality of the covering space,

the d0-brane and its image transform into two d4-branes on the dual covering space. the

embedding of the z2 action leads to two d4-branes wrapping the dual orbifold with a
non-trivial bundle structure encoded in the transformation law (4.9). from the boundary

state perspective we will see that this normalization of the d4-brane charge is required by

the existence of twisted d4-brane boundary states.

the spacetime bps state identied with the state (3.9) is the fractional d0-brane of

[22]. to compare the boundary states with the world volume analysis, the twist elds

are labeled as described before formula (4.3). inspection of (4.8) shows that the following

identications should be made:

(q4, q2, q0) = (0,a, 1
2 )
(q4, q2, q0) = (0,a, 1
2 )
(q4, q2, q0) = (0,a,  1
2 )
(q4, q2, q0) = (0,a,  1
2 )
observe that two of these d2-brane states also carry non-zero ux.

the neumann state related to the dirichlet state (3.8) by the duality t is given by

|d4d2ai = 2

2 |d4; vi  2

2 |n taii,

(4.13)

where |n taii is the neumann analog of (3.6) built over the ta = taata twist elds.
obtaining (4.13) by the t action on the fractional d0-brane states means that the xed
t 4 wilson line2 v entering their untwisted parts is again determined by the twist elds ta
in the boundary state. it is important to note though that it can be veried independently
of duality considerations that the states (4.13) are consistent boundary states. 3

furthermore, we can now x absolute normalization of d4-brane charges. being a bps

state, the twisted neumann state (4.13) must have an integral d4-brane charge which we

2 note that this is not a wilson line on the k3 surface.
3 a technical issue alluded to before is whether other combinations of untwisted and twisted

boundary states are allowed. this applies both to the fractional d0-branes and d4-branes. as can

be veried by open string calculations, consistency of the fractional d0 states with the fractional

d4 states excludes other combinations.

set to unity. comparison of this state with the inherited state in (3.4) leads to the con-

clusion that the inherited state indeed carries two units of d4-brane charge, in agreement
with the world volume analysis. note that the t -dual of the fractional d0-brane at the
origin carries the charge   , corresponding to a wrapped d4-brane with trivial gauge
bundle.

the agreement with the world volume analysis is easily checked by comparing the
action of the cft t -transformation on the low energy charges with the action of (4.9)
on the mukai charges. consider for example the bps vector a, a 6= 16. under (4.9) it
transforms into

whose rr charges are

(4.15)

our cft analysis reproduces this result. using (4.3) and the correct normalization for
the q4 charge, the charges of the t transformed boundary states are in exact agreement
with (4.15).

completing our discussion, we note the existence of consistent fractional d2-brane

boundary states which are a combination of four twisted ishibashi states with an untwisted

d2-brane state. the untwisted part corresponds to a d2-brane wrapping once the xed

plane suspended by the four xed points and carrying half the charge of the untwisted d2-

brane which is free to move away from the plane. for each xed plane there are four such

states corresponding to dierent relative orientations of wrapping the collapsed 2-cycles.

it is easy to verify from the discussion above that these states transform properly under
t . more precisely, each of the four transformed states corresponds to the new xed plane
intersecting the original one in one common xed point.

5. conclusions

when an exact cft description is possible, boundary states are a powerful tool

in deriving results which are otherwise obtained by a more complicated world volume

13

analysis. in this paper we used the boundary state formalism to derive the action (4.9) of
the inherited t-duality on the bps states of type ii theory on t 4/z2. as it is not easy
to nd an integral basis of the homology lattice in terms of the orbifold cycles, checking

whether (4.9) is an o(4, 20; z) element is dicult. boundary states are a strong evidence
that (4.9) is indeed a t-duality, since the action of the exact perturbative symmetry t
on them coincides with that of (4.9). the inherited t-duality can be combined with the

permutation symmetry of the four orbifold directions to yield a sub-group of o(4, 20; z)
preserving the b-eld and square t 4. it is interesting to check whether there are additional
symmetries which together with t generates the maximal sub-group of the t-duality group
preserving this background.
