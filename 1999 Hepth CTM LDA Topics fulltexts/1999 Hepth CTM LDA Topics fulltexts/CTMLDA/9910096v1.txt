we review the theory of higher spin gauge elds in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensional
anti-de sitter space and present some new results on the structure of higher spin
currents and explicit solutions of the massless equations. a previously obtained
d=3 integrating ow is generalized to d=4 and is shown to give rise to a pertur-
bative solution of the d=4 nonlinear higher spin equations. a particular attention
is paid to the relationship between the star-product origin of the higher spin sym-
metries, ads geometry and the concept of space-time locality.

1 introduction

the concept of supersymmetry as an extension of the spacetime symmetries
originally introduced by yuri golfand and evgeny likhtman in 1971 1 plays
tremendously important role in the modern high energy physics. nowadays it
is a text-book example of how important is to know a true symmetry when in-
vestigating a theory of fundamental interactions. in this contribution we focus
on some attempt to nd a larger (innite-dimensional) symmetry that extends
ordinary supersymmetry discovered by golfand and likhtman and underlies
the theory of higher spin gauge elds. the main motivation is that this further
extension of supersymmetry may lead to a most symmetric phase of a theory of
fundamental interactions. in particular we emphasize that quantum mechani-
cal nonlocality of star-product algebras of auxiliary spinor variables, identied
with the higher spin symmetry algebras, results in space-time nonlocality of
higher spin interactions.

a theory of fundamental interactions is presently identied with still mys-

terious m-theory,2 which should possess a number of properties such as:
(i) m-theory is some relativistic theory in d = 11. d=11 sugra is a low-
energy limit of m-theory.
(ii) m-theory gives rise to superstring models in d  10 providing a geometric
explanation to dualities.

1

(iii) star-product (moyal bracket) plays important role in a certain phase of
m-theory with nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of the antisymmetric
eld bnm.3,4 in the limit   0, bnm = const string theory reduces to non-
commutative yang-mills theory.5
(iv) a particularly interesting version of the m-theory is expected to have
anti-de sitter (ads) geometry explaining duality between ads sugra and
conformal models at the boundary of the ads space.6

the most intriguing question is: what is m-theory?. it is instructive to
analyze the situation from the perspective of spectrum of elementary excita-
tions. superstrings describe massless modes of lower spins s  2 like graviton
(s = 2), gravitino (s = 3/2), vector bosons (s = 1) and matter elds with spins
1 and 1/2, as well as certain antisymmetric tensors. on the top of that there
is an innite tower of massive excitations of all spins. since the corresponding
massive parameter is supposed to be large, massive higher spin excitations are
not directly observed at low energies. they are important however for the
consistency of the theory. assuming that m-theory is some relativistic theory
admitting a covariant perturbative interpretation we conclude that it should
necessarily contain higher spin modes to describe superstring models as its
particular vacua. there are two basic alternatives: (i) m 6= 0: higher spin
modes in m-theory are massive or (ii) m = 0: higher spin modes in m-theory
are massless. since m-theory is supposed to be formulated in eleven (or may
be higher) dimensions in the both cases massive higher spin modes in the com-
pactied superstring models may in principle result from compactication of
extra dimensions.

each of these alternatives is not straightforward. in the massive case it
is generally believed that no consistent superstring theory exists beyond ten
dimensions and therefore there is no good guiding principle towards m-theory
from that side. for the massless option the situation is a sort of opposite:
there is a very good guiding principle but it looks like it might be too strong.
indeed, massless elds of high spins are gauge elds. therefore this type
of theories should be based on some higher spin gauge symmetry principle
with the symmetry generators corresponding to various representations of the
lorentz group.
it is very well known however that it is a hard problem to
build a nontrivial theory with higher spin gauge symmetries. one argument
is due to the coleman-mandula theorem and its generalizations 7 which claim
that symmetries of s-matrix in a non-trivial (i.e., interacting) eld theory in a
at space can only have suciently low spins. direct arguments come 8,9 from
the explicit attempts to construct higher spin gauge interactions in physically
interesting situations (e.g. when the gravitational interaction is included).
these arguments convinced most of experts that no consistent nontrivial higher

2

spin gauge theory can exist at all.

however, some positive results 10 were obtained on the existence of consis-
tent interactions of higher spin gauge elds in the at space with the matter
elds and with themselves but not with gravity. somewhat later it was real-
ized 11 that the situation changes drastically once, instead of the at space, the
problem is analyzed in the ads space with nonzero curvature . this general-
ization led to the solution of the problem of consistent higher spin gravitational
interactions in the cubic order at the action level 11 and, later, in all orders in
interactions at the level of equations of motion.12,13,14

the role of ads background in higher spin gauge theories is very im-
portant. first it cancels the coleman-mandula argument which is hard to
implement in the ads background.15 from the technical side the cosmological
constant plays a crucial role as well, allowing new types of interactions with
p,n,m,k  pnmk , where
higher derivatives which have a structure sint
 denotes any of the elds involved and p can take negative powers to compen-
sate extra dimension carried by higher derivatives of elds in the interactions
(an order of derivatives which appear in the cubic interactions increases linearly
with spin 10,11). an important general conclusion is that  should necessarily
be nonzero in the phase with unbroken higher spin gauge symmetries. in that
respect higher spin gauge theories are analogous to gauged supergravities with
charged gravitinos which also require 16,17  6= 0.
higher spin gauge theories contain innite sets of spins 0  s < . this
implies that higher spin symmetries are innite-dimensional. suppose now
that higher spin gauge symmetries are spontaneously broken by one or an-
other mechanism. then, starting from the phase with massless higher spin
gauge elds, one will end up with a spontaneously broken phase with all elds
massive except for a subset corresponding to an unbroken subalgebra. the
same time a value of the cosmological constant will be redened because elds
acquiring a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value may contribute to the vac-
uum energy. so, there is in principle a possibility to have a spontaneously
broken phase with m 6= 0 for higher spins and  = 0 (or  small). a most nat-
ural mechanism for spontaneous breakdown of higher spin gauge symmetries
is via dimensional compactication. it is important that in the known d=3
and d=4 examples the maximal nite-dimensional subalgebras of the higher
spin superalgebras coincide with the ordinary ads susy superalgebras giving
rise to gauged sugra models. provided that the same happens in higher
dimensional models, this opens a natural way for obtaining superstring type
theories in d  10 starting from some maximally symmetric higher spin gauge
theory in d  11.
in this contribution we would like to draw attention to a deep parallelism of

3

some of the properties of m-theory with the theory of higher spin gauge elds,
focusing mainly on the higher spin symmetries and the closed nonlinear higher
spin equations of motion. for more detail on the lagrangian formulation we
refer the reader to 18 and original papers.11

2 higher spin currents

usual inner symmetries are related via the noether theorem to the conserved
spin 1 current that can be constructed from dierent matter elds. for exam-
ple, a current constructed from scalar elds in an appropriate representation
of the gauge group

is conserved on the solutions of the scalar eld equations

sional space-time, i.e. n = 0, . . . , d  1 while i and j are inner indices. con-
ventions used throughout the paper are summarized in the appendix).
translational symmetry is associated with the spin 2 current called stress

tensor. for scalar matter it has the form

supersymmetry is based on the conserved current called supercurrent. it
has fermionic statistics and is constructed from bosons and fermions. for

let us now explain notation, which simplies analysis of complicated tensor
structures and is useful in the component analysis. following 19 we combine
the einstein rule that upper and lower indices denoted by the same letter
are to be contracted with the convention that upper (lower) indices denoted
by the same letter imply symmetrization which should be carried out prior
contractions. with this notation it is enough to put a number of symmetrized
indices in brackets writing e.g. xn(p) instead of xn1...np.

themselves satisfy analogous irreducibility conditions. the conservation law

(19)

the currents corresponding to one-row young diagrams (i.e. with t = 0)
generalize the spin 1 current (1), supercurrent (4) and stress tensor (3). an
important fact is that they can be chosen in the form

n(s2) = 0, (n(s3/2)n) = 0).
analogously to the formula (5) for the angular momenta current, the sym-
metric (super)currents t allow one to construct explicitly x-dependent higher
spin angular currents. an observation is that the angular higher spin (su-
per)currents

j n() = t nn(s1)xm(t)m(t),n(s1), j n() = t n n(s3/2)

;xm(t)m(t),n(s3/2);

,
(23)

where we use the shorthand notation

xm(s) = xm . . . xm

(24)

also conserve as a consequence of (22) because when the derivative in (19) hits
a factor of xm, the result vanishes by symmetrization of too many indices in
the parameters  forming the two-row young diagrams.

since the parameters m(t),n(s1) and m(t),n(s3/2);
transversal, only the double traceless part of t nn(s1)

 are traceless and

(25)

(26)

contribute to (23). these are the (super)currents of the formalism of sym-
metric tensors (tensor-spinors).20,9 the currents with integer spins t n(s) were
considered in 21,22 for the particular case of massless matter elds.

(32)
inserting these expressions into (23) we obtain the set of conserved angu-
lar higher spin currents of even, odd and half-integer spins. the usual angular
momentum current corresponds to the case s = 2, t = 1.

remarkably, the conserved higher spin currents listed above are in oneto
one correspondence with the higher spin gauge elds (1-forms) n;m(t),n(s1)
and n;m(t),n(s3/2); introduced for the boson 23 and fermion 24 cases in arbi-
trary d. to the best of our knowledge, the fact that any of the higher spin gauge
elds has a dual conserved current was never discussed before. of course, such
a correspondence is expected because, like the gauge elds of the supergravi-
tational multiplets, the higher spin gauge elds should take their values in a
(innite-dimensional) higher spin algebra identied with the global symmetry
algebra in the corresponding dynamical system (this fact is explicitly demon-
strated below for the cases of d = 3 and d = 4). the higher spin currents
can then be derived via the noether theorem from the global higher spin sym-
metry and give rise to the conserved charges identied with the hamiltonian
generators of the same symmetries.

a few comments are now in order.
higher spin currents contain higher derivatives. therefore, higher spin
symmetries imply, via the noether procedure, the appearance of higher deriva-
tives in interactions. the immediate question is whether higher spin gauge
theories are local or not. as we shall see the answer is yes at the linearized
level and probably not at the interaction level.

it is well known that if the stress tensor is traceless this indicates a larger
(conformal) symmetry. this property extends to the higher spin currents pro-
vided that the higher spin currents are traceless.25

nontrivial (interacting) theories exhibiting higher spin symmetries are for-
mulated in ads background rather than in the at space. therefore an impor-
tant problem is to generalize the constructed currents to the ads geometry.
this problem was solved recently 26 for the case d=3.

8

explicit form of the higher spin algebras is known for d  4 although a
conjecture was made in 24 on the structure of higher spin symmetries in any
d. the knowledge of the structure of the higher spin currents in arbitrary
dimension may be very useful for elucidating a structure of the higher spin
symmetries in any d.

3 higher-spin symmetries

the key element of the theory of massless higher spin elds is the higher spin
gauge symmetry principle. its role is as fundamental as that of the poincare
superalgebra discovered by golfand and likhtman for supersymmetric theories.
from the d = 4 27,28,29 and d = 3 30,31,32,33,34 analysis it is known that the
relevant higher spin symmetry algebras h are certain innite-dimensional lie
superalgebras which give rise to innite chains of spins and contain adsd
algebras o(d  1, 2) and their superextensions as (maximal) nite-dimensional
subalgebras. to x conventions let us note that the generators of the adsd
algebra o(d  1, 2) can be identied with the lorentz generators lmn of o(d 
1, 1) and the generators of adsd translations p m  o(d 1, 2)/o(d 1, 1) with
the commutation relations

[lmn, lkl] = nklml  mklnl + mllnk  nllmk ,
[lmn, p k] = nkp m  mkp n ,
[p m, p n] = 2lmn .

(33)

it serves as the inonu-wigner

here 1 is identied with the ads radius.
contraction parameter:   0 in the at limit.
a structure of higher spin algebras h is such that no higher spin (s > 2)
eld can remain massless unless it belongs to an innite chain of massless
higher spins with innitely increasing spins. unbroken higher spin symmetries
require ads background. one can think however of some spontaneous break-
down of the higher spin symmetries followed by a at contraction via a shift
of the vacuum energy in the broken phase. in a physical phase with  = 0 and
m  mexp for higher spin elds, h should break down to a nite-dimensional
subalgebra g = {m mn, p m, qi
j , giving rise to usual lower spin gauge
elds. here the rst set of the generators corresponds to a susy algebra while
the second one describes some inner (yang-mills) part. from this perspective
the coleman-mandula type theorems can be re-interpreted as statements con-
cerning a possible structure of g rather than the whole higher spin algebra h
which requires ads geometry. these arguments are based on the d  4 expe-
rience but we expect them to large extend to be true for higher dimensions.
the origin of higher spin symmetries can be traced back 21 to the higher spin

conserved currents with higher derivatives discussed in the sec. 2. let us
summarize the main results for d = 3 and d = 4 following to 27,28,29,32,33,34.

3.1

d=3 higher spin symmetries and deformed oscillators

the ads3 algebra is semisimple, o(2, 2)  sp(2; r)  sp(2; r) with the diag-
onal subalgebra sp(2; r)  o(2, 1) identied with the lorentz subalgebra. a
particularly useful realization of the ads3 generators is

l =

1
4i{y, y} ,

p =

1
4i{y, y}

(34)

with the generating elements y and  obeying the relations [y, y] = 2i,
 = , 12 = 1 and

2 = 1 ,

[, y] = 0 .

(35)

the projectors to the simple components of o(2, 2) are identied with  =
1
2 (1  ).
in 35,31,36,32,37 it was shown that there exists a one-parametric class of
innite-dimensional algebras which we denote hs(2; ) ( is an arbitrary real
parameter), all containing sp(2) as a subalgebra. this allows one to dene a
class of higher spin algebras g = hs(2; )  hs(2; ). the supertrace operation
was dened in32 where also a useful realization of the supersymmetric extension
of hs(2; ) was given, based on a certain deformed oscillator algebra. since this
construction will play a key role below let us explain its properties in somewhat
more detail.

consider an associative algebra aq(2; ) with generic element of the form

f (y, k) =



xn=0 xa=0,1

1
n!

f a 1...n (k)a y1 . . . yn ,

(36)

under condition that the coecients f a 1...n are symmetric with respect to
the indices j = 1, 2 and that the generating elements y satisfy the relations

[y, y] = 2i(1 + k) ,

ky = yk ,

k2 = 1 ,

(37)

where  is an arbitrary constant (central element). in other words, aq(2; )
is the enveloping algebra for the relations (37) often called deformed oscillator
algebra.

an important property of this algebra is that, for all , the bilinears

t =

1
4i{y , y}
10

(38)

have sp(2) commutation relations and rotate y as a sp(2) vector

[t, t] = t +t +t +t ,

[t, y] =  y + y.

(39)

(40)

the deformed oscillators described above have a long history and were
originally discovered by wigner 38 who addressed a question whether it is pos-
sible to modify the commutation relations for the normal oscillators a in such
a way that the basic commutation relations [h, a] = a, h = 1
2{a+, a}
remain valid. by analyzing this problem in the fock-type space wigner found
a one-parametric deformation of the standard commutation relations which
corresponds to a particular realization of the commutation relations (37) with
the identication a+ = y1, a = 1
2i y2, h = t12 and k = (1)n where n is the
particle number operator. these commutation relations were discussed later
by many authors in particular in the context of parastatistics (see, e.g., 39).

according to (38) and (40) the sp(2) symmetry generated by t extends
to osp(1, 2) by identifying the supergenerators with y. in fact, as shown in
40, one can start from the osp(1, 2) algebra to derive the deformed oscillator
commutation relations. since this construction is instructive in many respects
we reproduce it here.

one starts with the (super)generators t and y which, by denition of
osp(1, 2), satisfy the commutation relations (38)-(40). since  and  take only
two values one can write

[y, y] = 2i(1 + q) ,

(41)

where q is some new operator while the unit term is singled out for conve-
nience. inserting this back into (40) with the substitution of (38) and com-
pleting the commutations one observes that (40) is true if and only if q anti-
commutes with y ,

qy = yq.

(42)

the relation (39) does not add anything new since it is a consequence of (38)
and (40). as a result we arrive 40 at the following important fact: the envelop-
ing algebra of osp(1, 2), u (osp(1, 2)), is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of
the deformed oscillator relations (41) and (42). in other words, the associative
algebra with the generating elements y and q subject to the relations (41)
and (42) is the same as the associative algebra with the generating elements
y and t subject to the osp(1,2) commutation relations (38)-(40).

let us now consider the factor algebra of u (osp(1, 2)) with respect to its

in other words, every element of u (osp(1, 2)) of
4 (1  2)(cid:1) a, a  u (osp(1, 2)) is supposed to be equivalent to

zero. this factorization can be achieved in terms of the deformed oscillators
(41), (42) by setting a

q = k ,

k2 = 1 ,

ky = yk .

(45)

thus, it is shown 40 that the algebra aq(2, ) introduced in 32 is isomorphic
4 (12)). this fact has a number of simple but important
to u (osp(1, 2))/i(c2+ 1
consequences. for example, any representation of osp(1, 2) with c2 =  1
4 (1 
2) forms a representation of aq(2, ) ( 6= 0) and vice versa (for any ). in
particular this is the case for nite-dimensional representations corresponding
to the values  = 2l + 1, l  z with c2 = l(l + 1).
let us note that the even subalgebra of aq(2; ) spanned by the elements of
the form (36) with f (y, k) = f (y, k) decomposes into a direct sum of two sub-
algebras aqe
(2; ) spanned by the elements pf (y, k) with f (y, k) = f (y, k),
p = 1
2 (1  k). these algebras can be shown to be isomorphic to the fac-
2 tt  is the quadratic
tor algebras u (sp(2))/i
casimir operator of sp(2) and can be interpreted as (innite-dimensional) al-
gebras interpolating between the ordinary nite-dimensional matrix algebras.
such interpretation of u (sp(2))/i(c2c) was given by feigin in 35 and fradkin
and linetsky in 37.

an important property of aq(2; ) is that it admits 32 a uniquely dened

supertrace operation

(46)
such that str(f g) = (1)f g str(gf ), f, g having a denite parity, f (y, k)=
(1)ff (y, k) (i.e. str(1) = 1 ,
str(k) =  while all higher monomials of
y in (36) do not contribute under the supertrace). this supertrace reduces

to the ordinary supertrace of nite-dimensional algebras for the special values
of the parameter  = 2l + 1 corresponding to the values of the casimir op-
erator related to the nite-dimensional representations of osp(1, 2) (sp(2) in
the bosonic case). this property allows one to handle the algebras aq(2; )
very much the same way as ordinary nite-dimensional (super)matrix algebras.
what happens for special values of  = 2l + 1 is that aq(2; ) acquires ideals il
such that aq(2; )/il amounts to appropriate (super)matrix algebras. these
ideals were described in 32 as null vectors of the invariant bilinear form str(ab),
a, b  aq(2; ). note that the limit    corresponds to the algebra of area
preserving dieomorphisms in accordance with the original matrix analysis 41.
by construction, aq(2; ) possesses n = 1 supersymmetry as inner osp(1, 2)
automorphisms. a more interesting property 40 is that it admits n = 2 super-
symmetry osp(2, 2) with the generators

t =

1
4i{y , y} , q = y , s = yk ,

j = k +  .

(47)

the deformed oscillator algebras are important for the description of the
higher spin dynamics not only in d=3 but also in d=4. the reason is that,
as shown in section 8.4, they allow one to formulate a non-linear dynamics
with explicit local lorentz symmetry as a consequence of (39). in its turn,
the analysis of the higher spin dynamics in the section 8.3 is interesting in the
context of the deformed oscillator algebra itself because algebraically it reduces
to the construction of some its embedding into a direct product of two weyl
(i.e. oscillator) algebras equipped with certain twist operators.

thus, the ads3 algebra is the algebra of bilinears in the oscillators y.
extension to higher spin algebras consists of allowing arbitrary powers in the
oscillators. namely the higher spin gauge elds w(y, , k|x)=dx w (y, , k|x)
have a form

w(y, , k|x)=



xb=0,1 n=0

1
n!

wa b1...n (x)kab y1 . . . yn .

(48)

the components wa b1...n (x) are identied with the higher spin gauge elds
in the d=3 space-time with the coordinates xn. the higher spin eld strengths
have a standard form

r(y, , k|x) = dw(y, , k|x)  w(y, , k|x)  w(y, , k|x) ,

(49)

where d = dxn 
in 30.

xn . this construction for the ordinary oscillators was suggested

13

the structure of the higher spin gauge elds (48) suggests that the d3

higher spin currents should form a similar set

j n;a b1...n (x) .

(50)

here, the two indices a = 0, 1 and b = 0, 1 play dierent roles. the label a
describes the doubling of all elds as a consequence of n = 2 supersymmetry
in the theory. this doubling can in principle be avoided in an appropriately
truncated theory 34. the label b distinguishes between the lorentztype elds
(b = 0) and frametype elds (b = 1) and therefore leads to two dierent
types of currents of any spin s = 1

to see that such a structure of currents ts the systematics of the section
2 one observes that in three dimensions all traceless two-row young diagrams
(7) with t > 1 vanish. indeed, consider the quantity

2 n.

y cc

b(t),a(p) = abcabcxb(t+2),a(p+2)

with some traceless xb(t+2),a(p+2) satisfying the antisymmetry condition
xb(t+1)a,a(p+2) = 0. on the one hand, one gets

xb(t+2),a(p+2) =

p + 1
p + 3

abcabcy cc

b(t),a(p) .

(51)

(52)

but on the other hand, from (51) it follows that y cc
b(t),a(p) = 0 since at least
one pair of indices of xb(t+2),a(p+2) will be contracted after the two epsilon
symbols are replaced by the combinations of the metric tensors.

as a result, only the currents corresponding to the young diagrams (7)
with t = 0 and t = 1 survive in the d3 case. the one-row currents (t = 0)
describe stress tensor-type higher spin currents and correspond to the currents
(50) with b = 1 while those with a single box in the second row describe
higher spin angular momentumtype currents and correspond to the currents
(50) with b = 0.

as shown in 42, the ambiguity in  identies with the ambiguity in the
parameter of mass in the d=3 matter systems. thus, a structure of global
higher spin algebra depends on a particular type of matter systems. this
property manifests the fact 34 that the parameter of mass in the matter eld
sector of the d3 higher spin system arises from a vacuum expectation value of
a certain scalar eld in the model, while the global symmetry algebra identies
with the centralizer of the vacuum solution in the larger gauge algebra having
a universal structure (see section 8.3).

a special property of the d3 higher spin systems is that higher spin gauge
elds do not propagate in d=3 in analogy with the usual chern-simons grav-
itational 43 and yang-mills elds although the higher spin gauge symmetries

14

remain nontrivial, like the gravitational (spin 2) and inner (spin 1) symme-
tries. the matter elds do propagate. in other words, higher spin gauge elds
and matter elds belong to dierent higher spin multiplets and the parameter
of mass of matter elds remains arbitrary.
in higher dimensions the situa-
tion changes signicantly because the higher spin gauge elds are propagating
massless elds and matter elds may belong to the same multiplet of higher
spin symmetry with the higher spin gauge elds thus necessarily being massless
just as in ordinary susy supermultiplets.

3.2

d=4 higher spin symmetries

algebraically, the situation in d=4 is analogous. the isomorphism o(3, 2) 
sp(4|r) allows one to realize the generators of lorentz transformations l,
l   and ads translations p  as bilinears

l =

1
4i{y, y} ,

l   =

1
4i{y , y } ,

p  =

1
2i

yy 

(53)

in the oscillators obeying the relations

[y, y] = 2i ,

[y , y ] = 2i   ,

[y, y ] = 0 .

(54)

the simplest version of the d=4 higher spin algebra 44 is identied with
the algebra of all polynomials of the oscillators and klein operators k and k
having the properties

k2 = k2 = 1 ,

ky = yk ,

ky  = y 

k

(55)

(all barred operators commute to all unbarred ones), i.e. the corresponding
gauge elds have a form 44



w = xa,b=0,1

xn,m=0

1

2im!n!

dxnwn

a b1...n 1... m(x)kakb y1 . . . yn y 1 . . . y m.

(56)
in accordance with (53), the gauge elds bilinear in the oscillators are identied
with the gravitational elds.

the operators k and k again play a role in the construction and lead to

n=2 supersymmetry 44 osp(2, 4) with the supergenerators

q1

 = y ,

q2

 = ikky ,

q1

 = y  ,

q2

 = ikky  ,

and the o(2) generator

j = ikk .

15

(57)

(58)

factoring out the trivial u(1) subalgebra associated with the unit element (as
explained in the section 4, the resulting subalgebra is spanned by traceless
elements) this osp(2, 4) becomes a maximal nite-dimensional subalgebra of
the innite-dimensional d=4 higher spin algebra.

according to 19,45,44 the elds

w (y, y, k, k; x) = w (y, y,k,k; x)

describe the higher spin elds while the elds

w (y, y, k, k; x) = w (y, y,k,k; x)

(59)

(60)

are auxiliary, i.e. do not describe nontrivial degrees of freedom.
(for that
reason this version of the higher spin algebra was called in 44 algebra of higher
spins and auxiliary elds shsa(1).) therefore we have two sets of higher spin
potentials

wa a1...n 1... m (x) ,

a=0 or 1 .

(61)

the subsets associated with spin s are xed by the condition19 s = 1+ 1
2 (n+m).
the complex conjugation transforms dotted indices into undotted and vice
versa, thus mapping n to m.

for a xed value of a we therefore expect a set of currents

j n

;1...n , 1... m(x) .

(62)

in accordance with the results of the section 2, it indeed describes in terms of
two-component spinors the set of all two-row young diagrams (7) both in the
integer spin case (n + m is even) and in the half-integer spin case (n + m is
odd), with the identication

s =

1
2

(n + m) + 1 ,

t = (cid:20) 1

2|n  m|(cid:21) ,

(63)

where [a] denotes integer part of a. the fact that d3 and d4 higher spin
algebras give rise to the sets of gauge elds which exactly match the sets of
conserved higher spin currents of the section 2 is very signicant.

3.3 extended higher spin algebras

higher spin dynamical systems admit a natural extension to the case with
non-abelian internal (yang-mills) symmetries, as was discovered for the d4
case in 46,29 and then conrmed for the d3 case in 33,34. the key observation
is that higher spin dynamics remains consistent if components of all elds

16

take their values in an arbitrary associative algebra m with unity im . for
j(y, y, k, k|x), i, j = 1 . . . n for m = m atn. the
example w (y, y, k, k|x)  w i
gravitational sector is associated with the elds proportional to im . therefore,
m describes internal symmetries in the model. for the case of semisimple
nite-dimensional inner symmetries, m has to be identied with some matrix
algebra. this observation leads to a class of higher spin systems with dierent
semisimple yang-mills algebras classied for d=4 in 29 and for d3 in 34. note
that, the yang-mills coupling constant g2 is the only dimensionless constant in
the theory. it identies with the dimensionless combination of the cosmological
constant and the gravitation constant g2  2 analogously to the case of
gauged supergravity 16,17.
in this section, we list following to 29 all global extended d=4 higher spin
symmetries with nite-dimensional internal symmetries. the case d=3 can be
considered analogously 34.

to solve the problem it is useful to investigate most general truncations
of the extended higher spin theories with arbitrary matrix algebras m , which
lead to consistent higher spin dynamics. to this end one nds such automor-
phisms  of the higher spin algebras which leave invariant the ads4 subalgebra
associated with the gravitational sector and the nonlinear equations discussed
in the section 8.2. the latter condition reduces to the simple additional re-
quirement that, in presence of fermions, the allowed automorphisms should
leave invariant the operator

k = kk ,

(64)

which enters explicitly the nonlinear higher spin equations as explained in the
section 8.2. (in the purely bosonic case, k becomes a central element and can
be truncated away.) truncating away all degrees of freedom except for singlets
with respect to the discrete symmetries associated with  one is left with some
consistent truncation of the full system being itself a consistent dynamical sys-
tem. in particular, in the sector of gauge potentials the truncation conditions
read  (w) = w. the requirement that the ads algebra associated with the
gravitational sector is invariant is imposed to guarantee that the vacuum
gravitational elds necessary for any relativistic perturbative interpretation of
the model survive in the truncated system.

for example the automorphism  dened according to

 (k) = k ,

 (k) = k

(65)

can be used to truncate away the auxiliary elds (60). in the rest of this section
we will be only concerned with the sector of dynamical elds. as a result, the
generating elements k and k only appear in this sector in the combination k.

17

using a combination of an appropriate involutive inner automorphism t of
the matrix algebra m with the boson-fermion parity automorphism f of the
algebra of oscillators one arrives at the class of higher spin algebras realized as
(n + m)  (n + m) matrices with the elements depending on the operators y

by denition (see e.g. 48), weyl algebra an is the associative algebra with
unity i and the generating elements y (,  = 1 . . . 2n) satisfying [y, y] =
ci for some nondegenerate skewsymmetric matrix c = c , i.e.an is
the algebra of n oscillators, an = (a1)n. we denote the associative algebra
spanned by the elements of the form (66), (67) an,m

am,n
. the complex higher spin lie superalgebra hgl(n, m|2l | c) is dened
via supercommutators in an,m
with respect to the grading (67) (of course, any
other eld instead of c can be formally used). the algebra hgl(n; m|2l) is not
simple, containing a trivial central element associated with the unit element of
a  m , i.e.

. obviously, an,m

hgl(n; m|2l) = u(1)  hsl(n; m|2l) ,

(69)
where hsl(n; m|2l) is the traceless part of hgl(n; m|2l) according to the deni-
tion of the trace 28 explained in the section 4.
the complex algebra hgl(n, m|2l) admits a number of real forms. of the
most interest are those which lead to unitary dynamics and, in particular,

l

to compact inner symmetries. the corresponding real higher spin algebras
hu(n; m|4) are spanned by elements obeying the reality conditions

j(y, y)

with

(y) = y ,

(p e) = 0,

(p o) = 1

(70)

(71)

(the algebras hu(n, m|2l) are dened analogously for l = 2k).
although being non-simple due to (69) the algebra hsu(n; m|4) plays a
fundamental role in the higher spin theory because all its gauge elds appear
in the spectrum including the spin 1 eld associated with the u(1) central
subalgebra. this is a manifestation of the general fact that the higher spin
gauge theories are based on the associative algebra structure rather than on
the lie (super)algebra structure as lower spin theories.

2

it turns out that the algebras hu(n; m|2l) exhaust all elementary higher
spin superalgebras which can be obtained with the aid of automorphisms of
the underlying associative algebra an,m
. further truncations of hu(n; m|4)
are based on the antiautomorphisms of an,m
which induce automorphisms of
hu(n; m|4) (for more detail on the relationship between antiautomorphisms
of associative algebras and automorphisms of the related lie superalgebras
see for example 28). these give rise to the higher spin algebras of orthogonal
and symplectic types denoted ho(n; m|4) and husp(n; m|4), respectively, which
also lead to consistent equations of motion for innite sets of massless elds of
dierent spins via appropriate truncations of the higher spin equations corre-
sponding to hu(n; m|4) 46,29. these subalgebras are extracted from hu(n; m|4)
by the conditions

(72)

with some nondegenerate bilinear form kl.
if kl is symmetric, kl = lk,
this leads to the orthogonal algebras ho(n; m|4). the skewsymmetric form,
kl = lk, gives rise to the symplectic algebras husp(n; m|4) (n and m
should be even in the latter case). the isomorphisms hu(n; m|4)  hu(m; n|4),
ho(n; m|4)  ho(m; n|4) and husp(n; m|4)  husp(m; n|4) take place as a con-
sequence of the isomorphism an,m
spin1 yang-mills subalgebras of the higher spin algebras dened this
way are spanned by the matrices independent of the operators y and y  as
a result, the yang-mills subalgebras coincide with u(n)  u(m), o(n)  o(m)
and usp(n)usp(m) for hu(n; m|4), ho(n; m|4) and husp(n; m|4), respectively.
thus, all types of compact lie algebras which belong to the classical series an,

let us note that the elds of all odd spins belong to the adjoint representations
of the corresponding yang-mills algebras while even spins always belong to a
reducible representation which contains a singlet component. this property
is important since this singlet component corresponds to the spin2 colorless
eld to be identied with graviton.
in other words, the nite-dimensional
algebra spanned by the elements (i bilinears in y , y) is a proper subalgebra
of all higher spin algebras. this is not surprising of course, because only
those truncations have been considered that leave invariant the gravitational
subalgebra sp(4).

the original higher spin algebra constructed in the section 3.2 (with trun-
cated auxiliary sector by virtue of (65)) is isomorphic to hu(1; 1|4). to see this
one identies k according to (68) and

(y, y )

(y, y )

.

(74)

the case with n = 0 or m = 0 corresponds to the purely bosonic higher spin
theories.

from the structure of the higher spin superalgebras it is clear why consis-
tent interaction for a spin s  2 eld in d=3+1 is only possible in presence
of innite sets of massless elds of innitely increasing spins. the reason is
that any eld of spin s  2 corresponds to generators which are some deg > 2
polynomials of y and y so that their commutators lead to higher and higher

20

polynomials. the same happens when one replaces the unit matrix i by some
non-abelian matrix algebra for bilinear polynomials in y and y, i.e. spin2
particles possessing a non-abelian structure require higher spin elds.
although no direct proof that the list of higher spin algebras is complete
is known, we conjecture that the three two-parametric classes of elementary
algebras described above and their direct sums exhaust all d=4 higher spin
superalgebras with nite-dimensional yang-mills symmetries. this conjecture
gets a nontrivial support from the analysis of the unitary representations of
the higher spin algebras in 47,29 where it was shown that the algebras listed
above admit unitary representations with the spectra of massless states having
exactly the same spin multiplicities as it follows from the eld theoretical
analysis of the higher spin equations of motion based on these superalgebras.
moreover, the algebras which can be obtained from the original higher spin
algebras by truncations incompatible with the structure of the higher spin
equations do not possess unitary representations containing enough states for
all massless elds associated with the gauge elds of these algebras.

a simplest example of a truncation that is well dened at the algebra level
but is incompatible with eld equations can be obtained by truncating away
the dependence on the klein operators k and k. the resulting algebra gives
rise to the set of gauge elds w(y, y) corresponding to massless elds of all spins
s  1, every spin appears once. however it neither admits a unitary massless
representation with this spin spectrum 47, nor corresponds to any consistent
truncation of the higher spin equations 46. one can however get rid of the
operators k and k in the purely bosonic case with w(y, y) = w(y,y). the
resulting bosonic algebra is hu(1; 0|4).
the higher spin superalgebras hu(n; m|4), ho(n; m|4) and husp(n; m|4)
are supersymmetric in the standard sense only if n = m. indeed, one observes
that (averaged) numbers of bosons and fermions in (73) coincide only for this
case. all higher spin superalgebras with n = m contain the ads superalgebra
osp(1; 4) subalgebra. the algebras hsu(n; n|4) contain the n=2 superalgebra
osp(2; 4). direct identication of the generators is according to (57) and (58)
with the realization (68) and (74).

for the special values of n = m = 2[n/2], the higher spin algebras admit
larger nite-dimensional supersymmetry subalgebras. this is a particularly
appealing special case with m identied with the cliord algebra cn (cn 
m at n

for odd n ).

for even n and cn  m at n 1

2  m at n 1

the corresponding higher spin algebras can be described by functions

of additional operators i, the generating elements of the cliord algebra

{i, j} = 2ij ,

21

(75)

i, j = 1 . . . n . a nice feature of these algebras is that they naturally contain
extended ads supersymmetry osp(n, 4) with the supercharges

and o(n ) generators

qi

qi

t ij =

[i, j] .

(76)

(77)

for odd n , the cliord algebras are semisimple, thus leading to semisimple
higher spin superalgebras. we therefore will only consider the case of even n.
these higher spin algebras were originally introduced in 28, where we used

notation shse(n, 4) for the algebras spanned by the even functions

f (,y,y) = f (, y, y) .

(78)

further truncation can be achieved by virtue of the natural antiautomorphism
 of the cliord algebra dened by (i) = i. as argued in 29, this truncation
is compatible with the higher spin dynamics for n = 4p when the opera-
tor k identied with 1 . . . n is invariant. the resulting algebras denoted
shse(n, 4|0) in 28 form minimal higher spin algebras possessing n -extended
supersymmetry and containing the gauge elds of the n-extended sugra su-
permultiplet e , ,    (spin 2), i
 (spin 1)
within the set of higher spin gauge elds w (y, y, k, k, |x). the spin 1/2 and
spin 0 elds from the sugra multiplets are contained in the sector of 0-forms
46,29 discussed in the section 8.2.

  (spin 3/2) and aij

let us stress that, in the framework of the higher spin gauge theories,
there is no barrier n  8 which was a consequence of the restriction s  2
in the framework of supergravity. the models with n > 8 can be considered
equally well. the restriction n  8 should be reinterpreted as a restriction on
a number of unbroken supersymmetries in the phase with broken higher spin
symmetries.

although the higher spin algebras based on the cliord algebra m = cn
are distinguished by a larger nite-dimensional supersymmetry, they are still
particular cases of the algebras described in the beginning of this section. the
identication is as follows 29:

shse(2l, 4) = hu(2l1; 2l1|4) ,

(79)

shse(8p, 4|0) = ho(24p1; 24p1|4) ,

shse(8p+4, 4|0) = husp(24p+1; 24p+1|4) .
(80)

22

the particular case of the higher spin theory with n=8 that corresponds
to a higher spin extension of n=8 sugra was considered recently in great
detail in 49. within the classication above this is the case of b

shse(8, 4|0) = ho(8; 8|4).

(81)

the appearance of 8 on the left and right hand sides of this isomorphism is
in shse(8, 4|0) 8 stands for the vector
a manifestation of triality of so(8):
representation of so(8) while in ho(8; 8|4) two its spinor representations are
referred to.

two comments are now in order.
the construction can be generalized to innite-dimensional algebras m .
in particular, one can consider the higher spin superalgebras h . . . (n; m|4) with
n   or/and m  , that will lead to theories with innite numbers of
massless particles of every spin. such theories may be of interest in the context
of spontaneous breakdown of higher spin gauge symmetries and a relationship
with string theory.

the analysis of extended symmetries in the higher spin theories elucidates
their deep parallelism with the string theory and, in particular, with the chan-
paton structure of inner symmetries. the lesson is that higher spin gauge
theories are based on the associative structure rather than on the lie structure
as lower spin theories like yang-mills and (super)gravity. in this respect, the
hsu(n, m|4) higher spin theories are similar to the oriented open superstring
theories while the ho(n, m|4) and husp(n, m|4) higher spin theories singled
out with the help of antiautomorphisms are analogous to non-oriented open
string theories. remarkably, all higher spin theories contain even spins and,
in particular, gravity. from that perspective higher spin theories necessarily
contain sectors to be associated with closed superstring.

3.4 towards d > 4

the challenging problem is to nd higher spin algebras for higher dimensions
d > 4. at the moment we neither know a complete structure of the higher spin
conserved currents nor a structure of the higher spin symmetry superalgebras
in arbitrary d.

algebraically, a straightforward generalization of the denition of d3 and
d4 higher spin algebras rst conjectured in 24 seems to be a most natural can-
didate for higher spin algebras in higher dimensions. it consists of introducing

bto avoid misunderstandings let us note that unfortunately the authors of 49 used the nota-
tion shse(8, 4) for the algebra called shse(8, 4|0) in 28,29 and in this paper.

it is an interesting algebraic problem to analyze the eld content of the
higher spin gauge elds originating from this construction in higher dimensions.
to the best of our knowledge a solution of the related problem of decomposition
of arbitrary symmetric tensor products of spinor representation into irreducible
representations of the lorentz group has not been yet elaborated for arbitrary
d. the situation in lower dimensions is simplied by the isomorphisms of the
ads algebras with the algebras of bilinears of oscillators, sp(4)  o(3, 2) and
sp(2)  sp(2)  o(2, 2).

in practice, instead of working with the algebras of operators as discussed in
the section 3, it is convenient to use usual functions endowed with the product
law

(f  g)(y) =

(2)2p z d2pud2pv exp(iuv)f (y + u)g(y + v) .

(87)

here f (y) and g(y) are functions (polynomials or formal power series) of com-
muting variables y where  = 1 . . . 2p. this formula denes the associative
algebra with the dening relation

y  y  y  y = 2ic ,

24

(88)

where c is the symplectic form used to raise and lower indices,

u = c u ,

u = uc .

(89)

the star-product dened this way describes the product of weyl ordered (i.e.
totally symmetric) polynomials of oscillators in terms of symbols of operators
50,51. thus, this construction gives a particular realization of the weyl algebra
ap.

usual dierential versions 52,50,51 can be derived from (87) by elementary

gaussian integration of the taylor expansion f (y) = exp y 

z f (z)|z=0,

a(y)  b(y) = e

i 
y1




y2 a(y + y1)b(y + y2)|y1=y2=0 .

(90)

this weyl product law (often called moyal bracket for commutators con-
structed from (90)) is obviously nonlocal. this is of course the ordinary
quantum-mechanical nonlocality. note that the integral formula (87) is some-
times called triangle formula 51 because, for two-component spinors, the term
uv in the exponential is equal to the (oriented) area of the triangle with
vertices at y, y + u and y + v.
in most cases the triangle formula (87) is
more convenient than (90) for practical computations and has a broader area
of applicability beyond the class of polynomial functions.

an important property of the star-product is that it admits a uniquely

dened supertrace operation 28

str(f (y)) = f (0)

possessing the standard property

str(f  g) = (1)(f )(g)str(g  f )

with the parity denition

f (y) = (1)(f )f (y) .

(91)

(92)

(93)

this is in accordance with the normal spin-statistics relation once  and  are
interpreted as spinor indices. note that the additional sign factor originates
from antisymmetry of the matrix c leading to

uv = vu .

(94)

(to prove (92) one takes into account that str(f g) = 0 if (f ) 6= (g) because
str(h) = 0 if (h) = 1.)

25

the fact of existence of the supertrace operation is very important for the
theory of higher spin gauge elds because it allows one to build invariants of
the higher spin transformations

a = a      a

(95)

as supertraces of products str(a  b . . .) provided that the elds a, b . . .
have appropriate grassmann grading for fermions.
the star-product algebras (87) can be interpreted as algebras of dierential
operators with polynomial coecients (often identied with w1+ algebras)
by setting

y1 = 2i


z

,

y2 = z

(96)

(for the case p = 1). from this perspective it may look surprising that the al-
gebra of dierential operators with polynomial coecients admits the uniquely
dened supertrace and no usual trace operation.

the star-product formulae (87) and (90) are very handy for practical com-
putations with oscillators. unfortunately, no useful analog of these formulae
is known for the deformed oscillators (37).

for the description of the nonlinear higher spin dynamics we will also
need another associative star-product dened on the space of functions of two
symplectic (spinor) variables

(f  g)(z; y) =

1

(2)2p z d2pu d2pv exp [iuv c ] f (z + u; y + u)g(z  v; y + v) ,

(97)
where u and v are real integration variables. it is a simple exercise with
gaussian integrals to see that this star-product is associative

(f  (g  h)) = ((f  g)  h)

(98)

and is normalized such that 1 is a unit element of the star-product algebra,
i.e. f  1 = 1  f = f .
algebra

the star-product (97) again yields a particular realization of the weyl

[y, y] = [z, z] = 2ic, ,

[y, z] = 0

(99)

([a, b] = a b b a). these commutation relations are particular cases of the
following simple formulae

[y, f ] = 2i

f
y ,

26

(100)

[z, f ] = 2i

f
z ,

(101)

which are true for an arbitrary f (z, y).

the star-product (97) corresponds to the normal ordering of the weyl

algebra with respect to the generating elements

a+
 =

1
2

(y  z) ,

a =

1
2

(y + z) ,

(102)

which satisfy the commutation relations

[a, a] = [a+

 , a+

 ] = 0 ,

[a, a+

 ] = ic

(103)

and can be interpreted as creation and annihilation operators. this is most
evident from the relations

a+
  f (a+, a) = a+

 f (a+, a) ,

f (a+, a)  a = f (a+, a)a .

(104)

star-product (97) admits the supertrace operation

str(f (z, y)) =

1

(2)2p z d2pud2pv exp(iuv)f (u, v)

(105)

which can be obtained from the weyl supertrace operation (91) (for the dou-
bled number of variables) by changing the ordering prescription. obviously,

str(f (z, y)) = str(f (z,y)) ,

(106)

fermions have zero supertrace once the boson-fermion grading is dened

i.e.
in accordance with the standard relationship between spin and statistics

f (z,y) = (1)(f )f (z, y)

(107)

(for y and z interpreted as spinors). then it is elementary to see that (92)
holds.

an important property of the star-product (97) is that it admits the inner

klein operator

(108)
which behaves as (1)nf , where nf is the fermion number operator. it is a
simple exercise to show that
(109)

 = exp izy ,

   = 1,

  f (z; y) = f (z;y)   ,

(110)

27

and

(  f )(z; y) = exp izy f (y; z) .

(111)

from (111) we see that, up to the exponential factor,  interchanges the
arguments z and y. for the d=4 problem we will need the left and right inner
klein operators

 = exp izy ,

 = exp iz  y  ,

(112)

   =    = 1 .

which act analogously on the undotted and dotted spinors, respectively:
(  f )(z,z; y,y) = exp izyf (y,z; z,y),
  f (z, z; y, y) = f (z, z;y, y)   ,

(  f )(z,z; y,y) = exp iz  y f (z,y; y,z),
(113)
  f (z, z; y, y) = f (z,z; y,y)   ,
(114)
(115)
the star-product (97) is regular: given two polynomials f and g, f  g is
also some polynomial. particular star-products corresponding to one or an-
other ordering prescription are of course equivalent in the class of polynomials
but may be inequivalent beyond this class. the reason is that reordering of
innite series may lead to divergent coecients (e.g., to an innite vacuum
energy constant term). moreover, it is not a priori guaranteed that star-
product of non-polynomial functions is well dened. the reader can easily
construct examples of functions f and g such that f  g will diverge because
the bilinear form in the gaussian integral will degenerate. the special property
of the star-product (97) is that it is dened in a certain class of nonpolynomial
functions 13,34 containing the nonpolynomial klein operators ,  and  in the
sense that the product is still associative and no innities appear in this class.
this is not the case for the weyl ordered star-product in the doubled spinor
space where it is not clear how to dene the klein operators ,  and  (at
least analogous exponentials are ill-dened in the algebra). since the klein
operators play important role in the construction, the star-product (97) ac-
quires a distinguished role. it is of course not surprising that the star-product
associated with the certain normal ordering (104) has better properties with
respect to potential divergencies. in fact, as shown in 13,34, the star-product
(97) is well dened for a class of regular functions which appears in the process
of solution of the nonlinear constraints in the section 8. this guarantees that
the non-linear higher spin equations are well-dened.

from (97) it follows that functions f (y) independent of z form a proper
subalgebra. due to (101) this subalgebra identies with the centralizer of the
elements z. note that for zindependent functions the star-product (97)
reduces to the weyl star-product (87). this is why we use the same symbol 
for the both product laws.

28

5 ads vacua

ads background plays distinguished role in the higher spin theories. it appears
naturally in the framework of the higher spin algebras as a particular solution
of the zero-curvature equation

dw = w  w .

(116)

(from now on we only consider the cases of d = 3 and d = 4.)

any vacuum solution w0 of the equation (116) breaks the local higher spin
symmetry to its stability subalgebra with the innitesimal parameters 0(y|x)
satisfying the equation

d00  d0  w0  0 + 0  w0 = 0 .

(117)

the consistency of the equation (117) is guaranteed by the vacuum equation
(116). as a result, (117) admits a unique solution in some neighborhood of an
arbitrary point x0 with the initial data

0(y|x0) = 0(y) ,

(118)

where 0(y) is an arbitrary x- independent element of the weyl algebra.

in the higher spin theories no further symmetry breaking is induced by
other eld equations. therefore, 0(y) parametrizes the global symmetry of
the theory, the higher spin global symmetry. as a result, we conclude that
global symmetry higher spin algebras identify with the lie superalgebras con-
structed from the (anti)commutators of the elements of the weyl algebra and
their extensions with the klein operators and matrix indices. note that elds
carrying odd numbers of spinor elds are anticommuting thus inducing a struc-
ture of superalgebra into (116).

since functions bilinear in y form a closed subalgebra with respect to
commutators it is a consistent ansatz to look for a solution of the vacuum
equation (116) in the form

w0 =

for d = 3 and

1

8i (cid:16)

0 (x){y, y} + h

0 (x){y, y}(cid:17)

(119)

1

8i (cid:16)

w0 =

0 (x){y, y} +   

0 (x){y, y }(cid:17) (120)
for d=4, respectively. here {a, b} = a b + b a. for the star-product (87) we
have

0 (x){y , y } + 2h 

{y, y} = 2yy ,

{y  y } = 2y  y  ,

{y, y } = 2y y  .

(121)

29

inserting these formulae into (116) one nds that the elds 0( 0) and
h0 identify with the lorentz connection and the frame eld of ads3 or ads4,
respectively, provided that the 1-form h0 is invertible. the parameter  = r1
is identied with the inverse ads radius. thus, the fact that the higher spin
algebras are star-product (oscillator) algebras leads to the ads geometry as a
natural vacuum solution.

the vacuum equation (116) has a form of zero-curvature equation and

therefore admits a pure gauge solution

(122)
with some invertible element g(y|x) of the weyl algebra g  g1 = g1  g = i.
the equation (117) then solves as

w0 = g1(y|x)  dg(y|x)

0(y|x) = g1(y|x)  0(y)  g(y|x) .

(123)

(clearly, (118) is true for a point x0 such that g(y|x0) = i.) this fact was
known long ago but unless recently it was not used for practical computation.
in this presentation we use it for the analysis of the higher spin dynamics in
ads4 following the recent work of kirill bolotin and the author 53.

a particular solution of the vacuum equation (116) corresponding to the

stereographic coordinates has a form

as shown in the section 6.1, when solving relativistic eld equations, g
plays a role of a sort of evolution operator. from this perspective  is analogous
to the inverse of the planck constant h,

  h1 .

(130)

this parallelism indicates that the at limit   0 may be essentially singular.
let us draw attention to an important dierence between the d=3 and
d=4 cases. the ansatz (119) in the d3 case solves the vacuum equation not
only for the usual oscillators y but also for the deformed oscillators (37)

w0 =

1

8i (cid:0)(x){y(), y()} + h(x){y(), y()}(cid:1) .

(131)

(x) and h(x) = dxnhn

the zero-curvature vacuum equation still implies that the elds (x) =
(x) identify with the lorentz connection
dxnn
(x) is non-degenerate). the
and dreibein of ads3 (under condition that hn
properties of the deformed oscillator algebra guarantee that this is true for any
value of the parameter , i.e. the dierential equations for 
0 which
follow from (116) are  - independent.

if we try to proceed similarly in the d=4 case with

8i(cid:16)

w0 =

0 (x){y(), y ()}+   

0 (x){y (), y ()}+2h 

0 (x){y(), y ()}(cid:17),
(132)
where y() and y () are two mutually commuting sets of deformed oscil-
lators, the result would be that for  =  = 0 the zero-curvature vacuum
equation indeed describes ads4 while for  6= 0 and/or  6= 0 (116) becomes
inconsistent, i.e. it admits no solution with the ansatz (132). the replacement
of the ordinary oscillators (54) by the deformed oscillators (37) breaks sp(4)
down to its lorentz subalgebra sl2(c) spanned by the generators l and l  .
commutators of ads translations p  for non-zero parameters  and  give
rise to higher and higher polynomials in the deformed oscillator algebra. to
construct some consistent vacuum solution for that case one has to introduce
innitely many nonvanishing vacuum higher spin eld components in the d=4
analog of the expansion (48). this fact will have important consequences for
the analysis of the section 9.

6 free equations

the structure of higher spin currents suggests that higher spin symmetries
relate higher derivatives of relativistic elds. once spin s > 2 symmetries

31

are present, the algebra becomes innite-dimensional. therefore, higher spin
symmetries relate derivatives of physical elds of all orders. to have a natural
linear realization of the higher spin symmetries, it is useful to introduce innite
multiplets reach enough to contain dynamical elds along with all their higher
derivatives. such multiplets admit a natural realization in terms of the weyl
algebra.

namely, in d=3 54 and d=4 46, 0-forms

c(y |x) =



xn=0

1
n!

c1...n y1 . . . yn

(133)

taking their values in the weyl algebra form multiplets of the higher spin
symmetries for lower spin matter elds and weyl-type higher spin curvature
tensors (in d = 4). the free equations of motion have a form 54,46

where

for d=4 and

for d=3.

d0c  (dc  w0  c + c  w0) = 0 ,

f (y, y) = f (y,y)
f (y, ) = f (y,)

(134)

(135)

(136)

in the both cases, tilde denotes an involutive automorphism of the higher
spin algebra which changes a sign of the ads translations (34) and (53). as a
result, the covariant derivative d0 corresponds to some representation of the
higher spin algebra which we call twisted representation. the consistency of
the equation (134) is guaranteed by the vacuum equation (116).

in this formulation, called in 54 unfolded formulation, dynamical eld
equations have a form of covariant constancy conditions. the fact that the
equation (134) is invariant under the global higher spin symmetries

c = 0  c  c  0

(137)

with the parameters satisfying (117) is obvious. moreover, one can write down
a general solution of the free eld equations (134) in the pure gauge form

c(y |x) = g1(y |x)  c0(y )  g(y |x)

(138)

analogous to the form of the global symmetry parameters (123), where c0(y )
is an arbitrary xindependent element of the twisted representation with y =
(y, y) for d=4 and y = (y, ) for d=3. here c0(y ) plays a role of initial data.
let us now explain in more detail a physical content of the equations (134)
starting with the d4 case.

32

6.1 ads4

in d=4, by virtue of the star-product (87) the system (134) reduces to

d0c(y, y|x)  dlc(y, y|x) + ih (cid:16)y y

one arrives at the following innite chain of equations

dlc(m), (n) = ih c(m), (n)   inmh c(m1), (n1) ,

where dl is the lorentz-covariant dierential

dla  = da  + 

  a  +  

  a  .

(141)

(142)

(143)

here we skip the subscript 0 referring to the vacuum ads solution and use
again the convention introduced in the section 2 with symmetrized indices
denoted by the same letter and a number of symmetrized indices indicated in
brackets.

the system (142) decomposes into a set of independent subsystems with
n  m xed. it turns out 46 that the subsystem with |n  m| = 2s describes
a massless eld of spin s (note that the elds c(m), (n) and c(n), (m) are
complex conjugated).

it is instructive to consider the example of s = 0 associated with the elds
c(n), (n). the equation (142) at n = m = 0 expresses the eld c,  via the
rst derivative of c,

c,  =

and

the second equation with n = m = 1 contains more information. first,

one obtains by contracting indices with the frame eld and using (145) that

hn
 

(dl

n c

,

 + 8ic) = 0 .

(146)

with the aid of (144) this reduces to the klein-gordon equation in ads4

c  82c = 0 .

(147)

the rest part of the equation (142) with n = m = 1 expresses the eld c,  
via second derivatives of c

c ,   =

1

(2i)2 hn

 

dl

n hm
 

dl

(148)

all other equations with n = m > 1 either reduce to identities by virtue of
the spin 0 dynamical equation (147) or express higher components in the chain
via higher derivatives in the space-time coordinates as
of elds c1...n, 1... n

(149)

this completes the proof of the fact that the system (142) with n = m describes
a scalar eld. the value of the mass parameter in (147) is such that c describes
massless scalar in ads4.

spin 1/2 is described by the mutually conjugated chains of elds c(m), (n)
with |n  m| = 1. in this case the rst equation with n = 0 and m = 1 has a
form
(150)

n c = ih 

n c,  .

dl

dirac equation is a simple consequence of this equation,

hn
 

dl

n c = 0 .

(151)

all the rest equations again do not impose any further restriction on the dy-
namical eld c just expressing higher members of the chain via higher space-
time derivatives of c. the fact that, although overdetermined, the system
(142) is consistent takes place because in (134) (d0)2 = 0 as a consequence of
(116).
analogously, the equations (142) with other values of n and m describe
free eld equations for spin s = |n  m| massless elds. however, for spins

34

s  1 it is more useful to treat these equations not as fundamental ones but as
consequences of the higher spin equations formulated in terms of gauge elds
(potentials). to illustrate this point let us rst consider the example of gravity.
as argued in section 3, lorentz connection 1forms ,    and vierbein
1form h  can be identied with the sp(4)gauge elds. the corresponding
sp(4)curvatures read in terms of two-component spinors

r12 = d12 + 1

r 1 2 = d 1 2 +  1

r  = dh  + 

  2 + 2 h1
   2  + 2 h
  h  +  

  h  .

  h2  ,
1  h 2 ,

(152)

(153)

(154)

the zero-torsion condition r  = 0 expresses the lorentz connection  and
 via derivatives of h. after that, the independent part of the curvature
2forms r (152) and r (153) coincides with the riemann tensor. einstein
equations imply that the ricci tensor vanishes up to a constant trace part
proportional to the cosmological constant. this is equivalent to saying that
only those components of the tensors (152) and (153) are allowed to be non-
vanishing which belong to the weyl tensor. as is well-known 55, weyl tensor
is described by the fourth-rank mutually conjugated totally symmetric mul-
tispinors c1234 and c 1 2 3 4 . therefore, einstein equations with the
cosmological term can be cast into the form

r  = 0 ,

(155)

r 1 2

c1212 ,

= h 1  h

r12 = h1   h2
(156)
it is useful to treat the 0forms c(4) and c (4) on the right hand sides
of (156) as independent eld variables which identify with the weyl tensor by
virtue of the equations (156). from (156) it follows that the 0forms c(4)
and c (4) should obey certain dierential restrictions as a consequence of the
bianchi identities for the curvatures r and r. it is not dicult to make sure
that these dierential restrictions can be equivalently rewritten in the form

2 c 1 2 1 2

.

dlc(4) = ih c(4),  ,

dl c (4) = ih  c, (4)  ,

(157)

where c(5),  and c, (5) are new multispinor eld variables totally symmetric
in the spinor indices of each type. (the factor of i is introduced for future
convenience.)

once again, bianchi identities for the left hand sides of (157) impose certain
dierential restrictions on c(5),  and c, (5) which can be cast into the form

35

analogous to (157) by virtue of introducing new eld variables c(6), (2) and
c(2), (6). continuation of this process leads to the innite chains of dierential
relations (142) with |n  m| = 4
dlc(n+4), (n) = i(h c(n+4), (n)   n(n + 4)h c(n+3), (n1))+o(c2),
(158)
dl c(n), (n+4) = i(h  c(n), (n+4)   n(n + 4)h 
c(n1), (n+3))+o(c2),
(159)
where o(c2) denotes nonlinear terms to be discarded in the linearized approx-
imation we are interested in. all these relations contain no new dynamical
information in addition to that contained in the original einstein equations in
the form (155), (156). analogously to the spin 0 case, (158) and (159) merely
express highest 0forms c(n+4), (n) and c(n), (n+4) via derivatives of the
lowest 0forms c(4) and c (4) containing at the same time all consistency
conditions for (156) and the equations (158), (159) themselves. thus, the sys-
tem of equations (155), (156), (158) and (159) turns out to be dynamically
equivalent to the einstein equations with the cosmological term.

as shown in 19,46 this construction extends to all spins s  1. the lin-

earized higher spin equations read

y y (cid:17)w(y, y | x) ,

expression for the linearized curvatures following from this denition is

(163)

36

for spins s  3/2 the equations (142), like in the case of gravity, do not
contain any independent dynamical information just expressing the highest

this statement, which plays a key role from various points of view, will be
referred to as central on-mass-shell theorem.

the innite set of the 0forms c forms a basis in the space of all on-
mass-shell nontrivial combinations of covariant derivatives of matter elds and
(lower and higher spin) curvatures.

eqs. (166) and (167) contain the free dynamical equations for all massless elds
and express all auxiliary components via higher derivatives of the dynamical
elds by virtue of (164) and (165) for the 0-forms and by analogous formulae

for the gauge 1-forms 19, where wphys denotes some eld from the list (168),
(169) while wgauge is a pure gauge part.

let us stress that the equations (166) and (167) are equivalent 19 to the
usual free higher spin equations in the ads space which follow from the stan-
dard actions proposed in 20. in addition they link together derivatives in the
space-time coordinates xn and in the auxiliary spinor variables y and y . in
accordance with (164) and (165), in the sector of 0-forms the derivatives in
the auxiliary spinor variables can be viewed as a square root of the space-time
derivatives,


xn c(y, y|x)  hn

  
y


 y 

c(y, y|x) .

(173)

(this is most obvious from (139).) analogous formula in the sector of higher
spin gauge potentials reads in accordance with (162) and (166)


xn w(y, y|x)  hn

 (cid:16) 

y y w(y, y|x) + y


 y 

w(y, y|x)(cid:17) .

(174)

as a result, any nonlocality in the auxiliary variables y may imply a space-time
nonlocality.

as argued in the section 4 the associative star-product acting on the auxil-
iary spinor variables is nonlocal, thus indicating a potential nonlocality in the
space-time sense. the higher spin equations contain star-products via terms
c(y |x)x(y |x) with some operators x constructed from the gauge and mater
elds. once x(y |x) is at most quadratic in the auxiliary variables y  , the
resulting expressions are local, containing at most two derivatives in y  . this
is the case for the ads background gravitational elds and therefore, in agree-
ment with the analysis of this section, the higher spin dynamics is local at
the linearized level. but this may easily be not the case beyond the linearized
approximation. we will illustrate this issue in terms of the integration ow
dened in the section 9.

another important consequence of the formulae (173) and (174) is that
they contain explicitly the inverse ads radius  and become meaningless in

38

the at limit   0. this happens because, when resolving these equations for
the derivatives in the auxiliary variables y and y, the space-time derivatives
appear in the combination

1 
xn

(175)

that leads to the inverse powers of  in front of the terms with higher derivatives
in the higher spin gauge interactions. this is the main reason why higher
spin interactions require the cosmological constant to be nonzero as was rst
concluded in 11.

to summarize, the following facts are strongly correlated:

(i) higher spin algebras are described by the (moyal) star-product in the aux-
iliary spinor space
(ii) relevance of the ads background
(iii) potential space-time nonlocality of the higher spin interactions due to the
appearance of higher derivatives at the nonlinear level.

these properties are in many respects analogous to the superstring picture
with the deep parallelism between the cosmological constant and the string
tension parameter. the fact that unbroken higher spin symmetries require
ads geometry may provide an explanation why the most symmetric higher
spin phase is not seen in the usual superstring picture with the at background
space-time. interestingly, recent insight into the structure of superstring theory
in 5 proves that star-product plays a key role in certain regimes.

6.2

plane waves in ads4

the fact that c(y |x) describes all derivatives of the physical elds compatible
with the eld equations allows us to solve the dynamical equations in the form
(138). the arbitrary parameters c0(y ) in (138) describe all higher derivatives
of the eld c(y |x0) at the point x0 with g(y |x0) = i. in other words, (138)
describes a covariantized taylor expansion in some neighborhood of x0. for
the gauge function (128), x0 = 0. let us now illustrate how the formula (138)
can be used to produce explicit solutions of the higher spin equations in ads4.

let us set

c0(y ) = exp i(y + y   ) ,

(176)

where  is an arbitrary commuting complex spinor and   is its complex
conjugate. taking into account that

g1(y |x) = g(y |x) ,

39

(177)

inserting g(y |x) into (138) and using the product law (87) one performs ele-
mentary gaussian integrations to obtain 53

c(y |x) = z2 exp ih(y y  +   )x  + z(y + y   )i ,

(178)

where z = 1 + 2 1

2 x x  . using

c1...n (x) =



y1

. . .



yn

c(y, y|x)|y=y=0 ,

one obtains for the matter elds and higher spin weyl tensors

c...2s(x) = z2(s+1)1 . . . 2s exp ik x  ,

where

k  =   

(179)

(180)

(181)

is a null vector expressed in the standard way in terms of spinors. (expressions
for the conjugated weyl tensors carrying dotted indices are analogous).

since z  1 in the at limit, the obtained solution indeed describes plane
waves in the at space limit   0 provided that the parameters  and  
are rescaled according to

  1/2  ,

   1/2  .

(182)

on the other hand, z  0 at the boundary of ads4 and therefore the con-
structed ads plane waves tend to zero at the boundary.
this approach is very ecient and can be applied to produce explicit solu-
tions of the eld equations in many cases as we hope to demonstrate elsewhere.
so far we only focused on the equation (167) for 0-forms c which has a form
of the covariant constancy condition and therefore admits an explicit solution
(138). interestingly enough, although the equation (163) does not have a form
of a zero-curvature equation, it also can be solved in a rather explicit alge-
braic way 53 using a more sophisticated technics explained in the section 9 and
inspired by the analysis of the nonlinear higher spin dynamics.

6.3 ads3

the d=3 linearized system is much simpler then the d=4 one because d3
higher spin elds are of chern-simons type and do not propagate analogously
to the case of d3 gravity 43. equivalent statement is that d3 higher spin elds do
not admit nonzero weyl tensors. in fact, the name higher spin gauge elds

40

is misleading for d=3 because these gauge elds do not carry any degrees of
freedom and therefore do not describe any spin. higher spin gauge symmetries
are however nontrivial.

consequently, the d3 central on-mass-shell theorem has a form

r1(y, , k|x) = 0 ,

d0c(y, , k|x) = 0 ,

(183)

where r1 is the linearized part of the d3 curvature tensor (49) and d0 is the
covariant derivative (134). as shown in 42, in the sector of 0-forms, (183)
describes four massive scalars c(y, , k|x) = c(y, , k|x) and four massive
spinors c(y, , k|x) = c(y, , k|x) arranged into n=2 d3 hypermultiplets.
the values of mass m are expressed in terms of  and  as follows 42

m 2

 = 2 (  2)

2

for bosons, and

 = 2 2
m 2
2

for fermions. the signs  correspond to the projections

c = pc ,

p =

.

(184)

(185)

(186)

one doubling of a number of elds of the same mass is due to the dependence
on  (2 = 1) while another one, with the mass splitting in the bosonic sector,
is due to k. as expected, the at higher spin connections do not describe
any local degrees of freedom. the property that the values of masses depend
on a free parameter  in the deformed oscillator algebra (37) is quite dierent
from what happens in d=4 where only massless matter elds appear because
they all belong to the same multiplet with massless higher spin gauge elds.

the component form of the covariant constancy conditions (183) with

appropriately rescaled component elds amounts to 42

dlc(n) = (cid:16)hc(n) + n(n 1)(cid:18)1
4 

m 2

(189)

(190)

the formula (138) is true for any value of  in the d3 case. however it is not
straightforward to apply it in the massive d3 case because no practically useful
formula is known generalizing (87) to the case of arbitrary . the problem of
developing an ecient machinery of the symbols of operators for the case of
general  is therefore quite interesting.

7 free dierential algebras and unfolded formulation
let us considerc an arbitrary set of dierential pforms w a(x) with p  0
(0-forms are included). let the generalized curvatures ra be dened by the
relations

ra = dw a + f a(w ) ,

(191)
where d = dxn 
xn and f a are some functions of w b built with the aid of the
exterior product of dierential forms. given function f a(w ) satisfying the
generalized jacobi identity

f b f a

w b  0

(192)

(the derivative with respect to w is left), we say following to 56 that it denes
a free dierential algebra. this property guarantees the generalized bianchi
identity

(193)

(194)

dra = rb f a
w b ,

which tells us that the dierential equations on w a

ra = 0

are consistent. clearly, the requirement that the equation (194) is consistent
for generic elds w a is equivalent to (192).

cin this section, the identication of indices may be dierent from the conventions summa-
rized in the appendix.

42

the property (192) allows one to dene the gauge transformations

w a = da  b f a
w b ,

(195)

where a(x) is a (deg(w a)  1)form (0-forms do not give rise to any gauge
parameters). with respect to these gauge transformations the generalized
curvatures transform as

ra = rc 

w c (cid:18)b f a

w b(cid:19) .

(196)

this implies gauge invariance of the equations (194). also, since the equations
(194) are formulated entirely in terms of dierential forms, they are explicitly
general coordinate invariant.

for the particular case when the set w a consists of only 1-forms wi, the

function f i(w) is bilinear

f i = f i

jkwj  wk

(197)

and the relation (192) amounts to the usual jacobi identity for a lie algebra
g with the structure coecients f i
jk (or superalgebra if some of wi carry an
additional grassmann grading). the equation (194) is then the zero-curvature
equation for g.

if the set w a also contains some p-forms c (e.g. 0-forms) and the func-

tions f  are linear in c

f  = ti



wi  c ,

(198)

 form some representation t of
the relation (192) implies that the matrices ti
g while the equations (194) contain zero-curvature equations of g along with
the covariant constancy equation dc = 0 for the representation t.



we see that the vacuum equations (116) r = 0 and free equations (134)
d0c = 0 are just of this form. therefore, the elds c span some representation
of the ads algebra. moreover, since the equations (116) and (134) are formally
consistent independently of a particular solution w0, the 0-forms c form some
representation of the whole innite-dimensional higher spin algebra. this is
the twisted representation dened by (137).

this simple observation suggests the following strategy for the analysis of
the higher spin theories (in fact, any dynamical system). starting from a space-
time with some symmetry algebra s and vacuum gravitational gauge elds
(1-forms) w0 taking values in s and satisfying the zero curvature equations
dw0 = w0  w0, one reformulates eld equations of a given free dynamical
system in the unfolded form d0c = 0. this can always be done in principle

43

and the only question is how simple is the explicit expression for d0c. indeed,
one starts writing
(199)

dl

0 = hnnci,n

n ci

for a given dynamical eld ci
0(x) with some set of spinor and/or vector indices

if they do, as it happens for fermions, one
0.
expresses the corresponding components of ci,n
0 treating the
unrestricted part ci,n
1 as new independent elds parametrizing on-mass-
shell nonvanishing components of rst derivatives. this leads to the equation

n ci

0 = hnn ci,n

then one writes

dl

1 = hnmci,n,m
ci,n

(200)

(201)

where ci,n,m
parametrizes the second derivatives. once again one checks, tak-
ing into account the bianchi identities for (200), which components ci,n,m
of
the second level elds remain independent provided that the original equations
of motion are true, expressing the rest of the components of ci,n,m
in terms of
the lower derivatives ci
1 . this process continues innitely leading to
a chain of equations having a form of some covariant constancy conditions. by
construction, the resulting set of elds ci,n1...nm
realizes some representation
of the space-time symmetry algebra s (e.g. poincare or ads). the interactions
are then described by nonlinear deformations of the resulting free dierential
algebra.

it is useful to address the question which innite-dimensional extension of
s can act on thus derived representation t of s. a natural candidate is a lie
superalgebra g constructed via (anti)commutators from the associative algebra
h

h = u (s)/i(t) ,

(202)

where u (s) is the universal enveloping of s while i(t) is the ideal of u (s)
spanned by the elements which trivialize on the representation t. of course,
this strategy is too naive in general because a set of elds c mixed by a higher
spin algebra and compatible with the nonlinear higher spin dynamics may take
values in a larger representation. in any case, u (s) is the reasonable starting
point to look for a higher spin algebra. based on somewhat dierent arguments,
this idea was put forward by fradkin and linetsky in 37. as shown in the
section 3.1 it works in d=3 at least for the case without inner symmetries.
similar interpretation of the weyl algebra (endowed with klein operators)

44

underlying the d=4 higher spin superalgebra can be given in terms of u (sp(4))
in the bosonic case and u (osp(1, 4)) in the supersymmetric cased.

the language of free dierential algebras is perfectly adequate for the study
of interactions of higher spin theories. the central on-mass-shell theorem is
just a right starting point to attack this problem which reduces to searching
for such a deformation of the equations (166) and (167)

r(w) = f2(w, c) ,

dc = f1(w, c)

(203)

with a 2-form f2 and 1-form f1, that is consistent in the sense of (192) and
reproduces the linearized equations in the lowest order of the expansion in
powers of c and w1 identied with the uctuational part in w = w0 + w1.
from (166) it is clear that the nonlinear deformation is inevitable in d  4
because
(204)

d2(c)  rc  c2

and therefore f1 necessarily starts from some terms bilinear in c. in its turn,
this may induce some further nonlinear correction to f2 as a result of the
dierentiation of c in (166).

it is not a priori guaranteed that some deformation f1,2 exists at all. if
not, this would mean that no consistent nonlinear higher spin equations exist.
(note that dynamics of any consistent system can in principle be rewritten
in the unfolded form.) once the complete form of f1 and f2 is found, the
problem is solved because the resulting equations are formally consistent, gauge
invariant and generally coordinate invariant as a consequence of the general
properties of free dierential algebras. by construction, it describes the correct
dynamics at the free eld level.

let us stress that one can proceed analogously for other dynamical systems
containing gravity either at the dynamical level (i.e with the zero-curvature
equation for the gravitational elds deformed by the weyl tensor) or at the
background level (i.e. with the background gravitational eld satisfying the
vacuum zero-curvature equation). the unfolded formulation has much in
common with the penrose exact sets of elds formulation 55. in this approach
some innite systems of equations also appear, containing both dynamical
equations and the relations expressing higher components via higher derivatives
of the dynamical elds. the important dierence is that the procedure we use
(unfolding) is formulated in terms of dierential forms (gauge potentials)

dthis is a consequence of the fact that weyl algebra acts on the fock space dened with
respect to creation and annihilation operators built from y and y  and identied with
the metaplectic (singleton) representation of sp(4|r) (for more detail see 29 and references
therein).

45

containing, in particular, the gravitational eld. as a result, our formulation
brings together such seemingly dierent issues as general coordinate invariance,
gauge invariance and formal compatibility of the dynamical equations. the
common feature of the two approaches is that all higher derivatives compatible
with the eld equations at any point x0 of the space-time are identied with
values of certain elds at x0, the elds c(y |x0) in the higher spin case.

coming back to the higher spin problem, let us note that there was one
more requirement imposed on the form of the higher spin free dierential al-
gebra. it was assumed that the gravitational lorentz connection  and   
only appear via lorentz covariant derivatives (and their commutator in the
riemann tensor). equivalently, the deformations f1,2(w, c) were required to
be independent of the lorentz connection. from (195) it follows that this
requirement means that the transformation law for local lorentz rotations re-
mains undeformed. this requirement is natural and restrictive as explained
in the section 8.4. the only other symmetry that remains undeformed in the
extended higher spin systems is the spin-1 yang-mills symmetry 13. all other
symmetries deform, acquiring some c-dependent corrections to their trans-
formation laws. in particular, this happens with the ads translations. it is
not surprising, since it is known from the sugra example 62 that local ads
translations acquire some curvature-dependent corrections which deform them
to dieomorphisms.

this general problem setting was studied for d4 higher spin theories in a
series of papers (see e.g. 46,57) within the order by order analysis in powers of
the 0-forms c. this perturbation expansion is natural because the 0-forms c
describe deviations of matter elds and higher spin weyl tensors from their
vacuum values c = 0, i.e. this is just a weak coupling expansion. in every
order, a contribution of the 1-forms w was taken into account completely. of
course, the important dierence between 0-forms c and 1-forms w is that the
latter can appear at most quadratically in this approach while the former can
appear in arbitrary power so that the functions f1,2 may be nonpolynomial
in c. the concrete form of the functions f1,2 is quite cumbersome and can
hardly be written down explicitly in all orders. however, in13,14 (and references
therein) it was suggested that these functions can be described as solutions of
certain rather simple nonlinear equations in additional spinor variables which
can be proved to have a unique solution modulo eld redenitions, thus, among
other things, proving the fact of existence of the higher spin free dierential
algebra in all orders in interactions. skipping technical details of the derivation
of these equations we instead formulate in the section 8 the nal result and
show how it reproduces the higher spin free dierential algebra.

let us note that although we know the closed equations for higher spins,

46

for the case of pure gravity or yang-mills theory an explicit form of all terms
nonlinear in c on the right hand sides of (158) and (159) is still unknown. the
form of c2 type terms was obtained for the case of gravity in 57. for the
(anti)selfdual case these c2 terms were shown to be complete.
the conclusion is that higher spin systems are in some sense simpler than
the lower spin systems used in the standard low energy theories. in fact, the
lower spin systems like einstein, yang-mills, and others are unlikely to be
subsystems of the full higher spin gauge theories, which can be obtained by
a consistent truncation. indeed, lower spin elds form sources for higher spin
elds via higher spin currents analogous to those considered in the section
2. to single out the lower spin subsystems one has to implement some limit-
ing procedure, a kind of low-energy expansion. a most natural possibility to
achieve this is via spontaneous breaking of the higher spin symmetries down
to some lower spin symmetries. the symmetry breaking parameter equal to
the inverse higher spin mass scale should then be identied with an expansion
parameter reminiscent of  in superstring theory. of course, some of the nice
properties of the original theory with unbroken higher spin gauge symmetries
may be lost in the resulting low-energy lower spin system.

8 nonlinear higher-spin equations

in this section we resolve the problem of reconstruction of the d=3 and d=4
higher spin free dierential algebra in all orders by formulating some closed
consistent system in an appropriately extended space. the resulting formu-
lation, based on certain non-commutative yang-mills elds, is interesting on
its own right and, in particular, in the context of the recent developments in
the superstring theory 4,5. the content of this section is based on the papers
13,14,33,34,59.

8.1 doubling of spinor variables and non-commutative gauge theory

the key element of the construction consists of the doubling of auxiliary ma-
jorana spinor variables y in the higher spin 1-forms and 0-forms

w(y ; q|x)  w (z; y ; q|x) ,

c(y ; q|x)  b(z; y ; q|x)

(205)

and formulating equations which determine the dependence on the additional
variables z in terms of initial data

w(y ; q|x) = w (0; y ; q|x) ,

c(y ; q|x) = b(0; y ; q|x).

(206)

the variables q denote some discrete (cliord) variables which are dierent
for d = 3 and d = 4 cases and will be specied later.

47

to this end we introduce a new compensator-type spinor eld s(z; y ; q|x)
which carries only pure gauge degrees of freedom and plays a role of a covariant
dierential along the additional z directions. it is convenient to introduce an-
ticommuting zdierentials dz dz  = dz dz  to interpret s(z; y ; q|x)
as z 1-forms,
(207)

s = dz  s .

the full system of equations in d=3 and d=4 has the following form

dw = w  w ,

db = w  b  b  w ,
ds = w  s  s  w ,

s  b = b  s ,

s  s = dz  dz  (ic + 4r(b; c)) ,

(208)

(209)

(210)

(211)

(212)

where c is the charge conjugation matrix and r(b; c) is certain star-
product function of the eld b and some central elements c of the algebra. the
function r(b; c) encodes all information about the higher spin dynamics and
will be specied later.

in the analysis of the higher spin dynamics, a typical vacuum solution for

the eld s is

s0 = dz z .

from (101) it follows then that

where

[s0, f ] = 2if ,

 = dz  

z  .

(213)

(214)

(215)

interpreting the deviation of the full eld s from the vacuum value s0 as a
zcomponent of the gauge eld w ,

s = s0 + 2idz w ,

one rewrites the equations (208), (210) and (212) as
r = dz dz  r(b; c)

and the equations (209) and (211) as

db = 0 .

48

(216)

(217)

(218)

here the generalized curvatures and covariant derivative are dened by the
relations

r = (d+)(dxnwn+dz  w)(dxnwn+dz w )(dxnwn+dz w ) , (219)
d(a) = (d + )a  (dxnwn + dz w )  a + a  (dxnwn + dz  w ) . (220)
(it is assumed that dxndz  = dz dxn.) we see that the function r in
(212) identies with the zz components of the generalized curvatures, while
xx and xz components of the curvature vanish. the equation (218) means
that the curvature r is covariantly constant.

the equations (217) and (218) are consistent. the bianchi identities for
(217) are satised as a consequence of (218). the bianchi identities for (218)
are compatible with the equation (217) reducing to the star-commutators of
some functions of b and central elements c which vanish due to the simple fact
that f (b; c)  g(b; c)=g(b; c)  f (b; c) for any f and g since b commutes
to itself and central elements.
a related statement is that the equations (217) and (218) are gauge in-

variant under the transformations

(dxnwn + dz w ) = (d+ ) +  (dxnwn + dz  w) (dxnwn + dz  w)  ,
(221)
(222)
with an arbitrary gauge parameter (z; y ; q|x). in terms of the original vari-
ables the gauge transformations (221) have a form

b = [, b] ,

w = d + [, w ] ,

(223)

s = [, s] .

(224)
note that the gauge transformations for zcomponents w of the gauge eld
acquire the inhomogeneous term due to the vacuum expectation value s0 of s.
the consistency of the system of equations (208)-(212) guarantees that
it admits a perturbative solution as a system of dierential equations with
respect to z. this proves that all elds can be expressed modulo gauge
transformations in terms of the initial data (206) identied with the physical
higher spin elds.
inserting thus obtained expressions into (208) and (209)
one nds some (nonlinear) corrections to zindependent parts of the higher
spin curvatures and covariant derivatives. (one has to take into account that
(f  g)(0; y ) is generically dierent from zero if f (0; y ) = 0 and/or g(0; y ) = 0
because zdependent terms in f and/or g contribute to the zindependent
part of their star-product). by construction, the resulting system of equations

49

will be consistent as a space-time free dierential algebra, thus solving the
problem. concrete details of this procedure for d=4 and d=3 are explained in
the sections 8.2 and 8.3 following to the original papers 13,14,33,34.

since all components of curvatures and covariant derivatives along space-
time directions vanish, this allows one to solve all those equations, which con-
tain space-time derivatives, in the pure gauge form analogous to (122) and
(123)

w = g1(z; y ; q|x)  dg(z; y ; q|x) ,

b(z; y ; q|x) = g1(z; y ; q|x)  b(z; y ; q)  g(z; y ; q|x) ,
s(z; y ; q|x) = g1(z; y ; q|x)  s(z; y ; q)  g(z; y ; q|x)

(225)

(226)

(227)

with some invertible g(z; y ; q|x) and arbitrary xindependent functions
b(z; y ; q) and s(z; y ; q). due to the gauge invariance of the whole system one
is left only with the equations (211) and (212) for b(z; y ; q) and s(z; y ; q).
these encode in a coordinate independent way all information about the dy-
namics of massless elds of all spins. from the perspective of the equations
(217) and (218) these equations imply some algebraic (via particular form of
r) and dierential (dz d b = 0) constraints on the zz non-commutative
star-product eld strength built from the potential dz  w (z; y ; q).
the global symmetry of the system is identied with the subalgebra of
the local symmetry (222)-(224) that leaves invariant a vacuum solution w0,
b0 and s0 of the eld equations. from (222)-(224) it follows that the global
symmetry parameters satisfy

dgl = [w0, ] ,

[gl, b0] = 0 ,

[gl, s0] = 0 .

(228)

the rst equation is consistent because w0 satises (208) and can be solved
as

gl(z; y ; q|x) = g1

0 (z; y ; q|x)  gl

0 (z; y ; q)  g0(z; y ; q|x) .

(229)

the second one will be satised trivially since we will only consider vacuum
solutions with b0 = const. the third implies that gl
0 belongs to the centralizer
of s0. we therefore conclude that the global symmetry algebra is isomorphic
to the centralizer of s0. (note that s0 = s0(x0) if g0(z; y ; q|x0) = 1; the
centralizers of s0(x) for dierent x are pairwise isomorphic due to (227).)
in our approach, non-commutative gauge elds appear in the auxiliary
spinor space associated with the coordinates z . the dynamics of the higher
spin gauge elds is formulated entirely in terms of the corresponding non-
commutative gauge curvatures. for the rst sight it is very dierent from the
non-commutative yang-mills model considered recently in 5 in the context of

50

the description of the new phase of string theory, in which star-product is de-
ned directly in terms of the original space-time coordinates xn. however, the
dierence may be not that signicant taking into account the relationships like
(173) and (174) between space-time and spinor derivatives, which are them-
selves consequences of the equations (208) and (209) as will become clear in the
sections 8.2 and 8.3. from this perspective, the situation with the higher spin
equations is reminiscent of the fedosov quantization approach developed in 60
to solve the problem of quantization of symplectic structures. in this approach
the complicated problem of quantization of some (base) manifold (coordinates
xn) is reduced to a simpler problem of quantization in the bre endowed with
the weyl star-product structure (analog of coordinates z n). an important
dierence between the fedosovs approach and the structures underlying the
higher spin equations is that the former is based on the vector ber coordi-
nates z n, while the higher spin dynamics prefers spinor coordinates z  (see
also 61 for a discussion of the parallels between the higher spin gauge theory
and fedosov quantization).

a few comments are now in order.
as explained in the sections 8.2 and 8.3, the discrete variables q sometimes
do not commute with the spinor elements dz  and z . one therefore has to
z and dz  taking into account
be careful with the naive interpretation of
some additional sign factors when necessary.



sometimes, less trivial vacuum solutions with s0 6= dz  z turn out to be
relevant. in that case, [s0, a] 6= a, and the interpretation in terms of the
usual noncommutative yang-mills theory becomes less straightforward. more-
over, as shown in the section 8.3, the same equations may admit dierent
vacuum solutions with essentially dierent vacuum elds s0. from that per-
spective it is practically more convenient to treat s  s as the fundamental
object generalizing the non-commutative yang-mills strength.
the fact that the equations of motion (208)-(212) are formulated in terms
of elds w , b and s taking values in the associative star-product algebra
a allows one to extend the construction to the case with inner symmetries by
endowing all elds with the matrix indices, i.e. by the extension a  am atn.
the analysis of possible reductions of the full system 13 is parallel to that of
the section 3.3. the perturbative analysis will work equally well provided
that non-zero vacuum elds w0
j take values in the singlet
subalgebra a  i spanned by the n  n unit matrices.
consistency of the system (208)-(212) is not sucient alone to x a form
of the curvature r. some additional arguments taking into account that the
system should describe appropriate relativistic dynamics have to be added. we
will come back to this point in the section 8.4.

8.2 nonlinear equations in d=4

in the d=4 case higher spin dynamics is described by the eld variables
w (z; y ;k|x), b(z; y ;k|x) and s(z; y ;k|x) depending on the space-time
coordinates xn (n = 0  3), spinor variables z  = (z, z ), y = (y, y ) and
two klein operators k = (k, k). s is a 1-form with respect to the auxiliary
anticommuting spinorial dierentials dz and dz ,

s = s + s ,

s = dzs(z; y ;k|x) ,

s = dz s (z; y ;k|x) ,

dotted spinors, respectively,

in addition, it is required that

u = (u, u ) for u = (u, u ) .

k2 = k2 = 1 ,

[k, k] = 0 ,

[k, dxn] = [k, dxn] = 0;

{dxn, dz} = 0 ,

{dxn, dz } = 0 .

in accordance with (232), we assume in this section that the klein operators
k (k) anticommute with the dierentials dz (dz ).

the eld variables w , b and s obey the (anti-)hermiticity (reality) con-

ditions

(236)
with the involution  (i.e., (f  g) = g f , (f ) = f, (f + g) = f  + g)
dened by the relations

w  = w, b = b, s = s

(z) = z , (y) = y , (dz) = dz , (dx ) = dx , k = k .
following to 14 we x the curvature on the right hand side of (212) in the

(241)

where  and  are the inner klein operators (112).

from (114) and (232) it follows that

f (z; y ;k; dz) = f (z; y ;k; d z), f (z; y ;k; dz) = f (z; y ;k;d z) ,
(242)
i.e., () commutes with all quantities except for dz(dz ). as a result, the
equation (212) with the curvature tensor (238) acquires a form of two mutually
commuting deformed oscillator relations with f (b) and f (b) playing a role
of  and , respectively (note that b commutes with s and is covariantly
constant according to (211) and (209)).

in order to prove that the system (208)-(212) is consistent, one has to use

the fact that the quantities

and

c1 = dzdz,

c1 = dz dz 

c2 = dzdz,

c1 = dz dz 

(243)

(244)

behave as central elements commuting with all elements of the algebra. as
for c1 and c1, this is trivial. for c2 and c2, this is also the case, but now one
has to take into account that spinorial indices take just two values. indeed,
due to the factors of  () , c2 (c2) anticommutes with all odd functions of
dz (dz ). however, when spinorial indices take just two values, all these
potentially dangerous terms vanish since (dz)3  0, and therefore c2 and c2
commute with everything. this property encodes the fact that the equations
under investigation make sense for two-component spinors thus restricting our
consideration to the four-dimensional dynamics.

the equations (208)-(212) are general coordinate invariant (in the xspace
sense) and invariant under the higher spin gauge transformations (222)-(224).
now, we are in a position to analyze the equations (208)-(212) in the
linearized approximation. let us assume that f (0) = 0 (i.e. f0 = 0 in (239)).
for this case a vacuum solution can be chosen in the form

b0 = 0 ,

53

(245)

s0 = dzz + dz  z 

and

w0 =

4i

[0

(x)yy + 0

 (x)y y ]

(246)

(247)

with the ads4 gravitational vacuum elds discussed in the section 5. this
ansatz solves the equations (208)-(212).

pendent

in the lowest order, we obtain from (211) and (101) that b is z inde-
(248)

b(z; y ;k|x) = c(y ;k|x) + higher order terms.

inserting this into (212) one arrives at the following dierential restrictions on
the rst-order part s1 of s :

1
2

s1 =

[dzdzf1c(z, y;k)k exp izy + dz dz  f1c(y,z;k)k exp iz  y ],
(249)
where we have made use of (113), (241) and (242). using the simple fact that,
for two-component spinors, the general solution of the equation


z f (z) = g(z)

is

f(z) =



z (z) +z 1

0

dt t z g(tz) ,

(250)

(251)

where (z) is an arbitrary function, one deduces from (249) that

s1 = 1 + z 1

0

dt t[dzzf1c(tz, y;k)k exp itzy

+ dz  z  f1c(y,tz;k)k exp itz  y

] .

(252)

the ambiguity in the function 1 = 1(z; y ;k) manifests invariance under
the gauge transformations (221) in the zsector. it is convenient to x a gauge
by requiring 1 = 0 in (252). this gauge xing is not complete as it does not
x the gauge transformations with

1(z; y ) = 1(y ) + higher order terms .

(253)

thus, the eld s is entirely expressed in terms of the 0-form b, disap-
pearing as an independent dynamical variable. in this sense, s can be thought
of as a sort of a pure gauge compensator eld. this result is not surprising
since it means that the noncommutative gauge connection s is reconstructed

54

in terms of the noncommutative curvature f (b) uniquely modulo gauge trans-
formations.

now, let us analyze the equation (210). in the rst order, one gets

2iw1 = ds1  [w0, s1] .
using the fact that generic solution of the equation

has the form


z (z) = (z)

(z) = const +z 1

0

dt z (tz)

provided that



z (z)  0 and  = 1, 2, one nds from (254)

w1(z; y ;k) = w(y ;k) +

i

2 z 1

0

dt(cid:16)z[w0, s1 ](tz, z; y ;k)
+z [w0, s1 ](z, tz; y ;k)(cid:17)

(254)

(255)

(256)

(257)

(the terms with zds1  + z ds1  vanish due to the formula (252) with 1 = 0
because zz  z z   0). let us stress that, as shown in the section 8.1,
(254) is consistent as the system of dierential equations with respect to 
z ,

 z and 
x . as a result, it is enough to analyze the equations (208) and (209)
at z  = 0. for other values of z , (208) and (209) will hold automatically
provided that the equations (210)-(212) are solved.

thus, to derive dynamical higher spin equations, one has to insert (257)
into (208) and (209) interpreting w(y ;k|x) and c(y ;k|x) as generating func-
tions for the higher spin elds. note that the gauge transformations (253)
preserving the linearized gauge condition 1 = 0 identify with the gauge
transformations for w(y ;k|x), the higher spin gauge transformations.
(252) is elementary. the nal result is

the straightforward analysis of (208) at z = 0, based on (97), (247) and

(258)

note that all terms with the lorentz connection 0  and 0   in the c
dependent part of this formula cancel. this is a particular manifestation of
the general property discussed in the section 7 that the higher spin equations
are covariant with respect to the local lorentz transformations.

the equation (209) reduces to

dc = w0  c  c  w0 + higher order terms .

(259)

the equations (258) and (259) thus describe all dynamical information con-
tained in the linearized system (208)-(212).

to make contact with the section 6.1 let us expand the elds as

w(y;k|x) = xa,b=0,1

wab(y |x)kakb, c(y;k|x) = xa,b=0,1

2cab(y |x)kakb.

(260)
inserting these expressions back into (258) and (259) one nds that the equa-
tions for the elds waa and ca 1a reduce exactly to the central on-mass-
shell theorem (166) and (167).

the elds wa 1a and caa are auxiliary and do not describe nontrivial
degrees of freedom as was rst shown in 58. another way to see this is to
observe that the set of free equations for caa decomposes into an innite set
of nite subsets of equations for homogeneous polynomials in spinor variables.
because c = caa(x0) plays a role of initial data in the pure gauge solution
of the covariant constancy conditions we conclude that each of the subsystems
contained in caa describes at most a nite number of degrees of freedom.
moreover, because the ads4 algebra o(2, 3) is noncompact, it does not admit
nite-dimensional unitary representations and, therefore, these degrees of free-
dom should not appear in a unitary theory (ruled out by appropriate boundary
conditions). as a result, caa describes some topological elds which carry no
degrees of freedom in the unitary case. let us note that the equations for
ca1a decompose into innite subsystems each identied with the equations
for some dynamical elds.

the auxiliary elds can be truncated away from the full system by the

discrete symmetry
 (w (z; y; k, k|x)) = w (z; y;k,k|x),

 (b(z; y ; k, k|x)) = b(z; y ;k,k|x)

 (s(z; y; k, k|x)) = s(z; y;k,k|x),
(261)
(262)

56

which takes place at least if f (b) is odd. we therefore do not discuss the
auxiliary elds here in more detail (the only comment is that the appropri-
ate sector of the equations (258) and (259) just reproduces the analog of the
central-on-mass-shell theorem for the sector of auxiliary elds).

let us note that the operators k and k that appear explicitly in the equa-
tions via (238) ip a type of the representation linking gauge elds (1-forms)
in the adjoint representation of the higher spin algebra to the 0-forms c in the
twisted representation and vice versa. we see that every massless spin appears
twice due to the klein operator kk giving rise to the labels a for the higher
spin gauge elds waa. it is impossible to get rid of kk by any eld redenition.
(in the purely bosonic case however the operator kk belongs to the center of
the algebra and therefore can be replaced by a constant.) note that in the
recent paper 63 it was shown that some particle models formulated in terms
of twistor variables exhibit analogous spectra of spins of massless particles. it
is an interesting problem to establish some direct connection between these
superparticle models and higher spin algebras.

taking into account higher-order terms one can in principle reconstruct all
higher-order corrections to the higher spin equations. thus the system (208)-
(212) indeed solves the problem of reconstruction of the nonlinear higher spin
free dierential algebra discussed in the section 7. note that the nonlinear
terms in the expansion (239) contribute only to the nonlinear corrections in
the resulting free dierential algebra and therefore describe some ambiguity in
the higher spin interactions.

8.3 nonlinear equations in d=3

the full nonlinear d = 2 + 1 system is formulated 34 in terms of the functions
w (z; y; 1,2, k, |x), b(z; y; 1,2, k, |x), and s(z; y; 1,2, k, |x) that depend
on the space-time coordinates xn (n = 0, 1, 2), auxiliary spinors z, y ( =
1, 2), [y, y] = [z, z] = [z, y] = 0, a pair of cliord elements {i, j} =
2ij (i = 1, 2) that commute to all other generating elements, and another pair
of cliord-type elements k and  which have the following properties
k2 = 1 , 2 = 1 , k+k = 0 , ky = yk , kz = zk , y = y , z = z .
(263)

the eld variables obey the (anti-)hermiticity (reality) conditions

w  = w, b = b, s

 = s

(264)

with the involution  dened by the relations
(z) = z,

(y) = y,

(i) = i,

k = k,

 = ,

(dxn) = dxn .
(265)

57

to dene the d = 3 equations of motion we have to x a form of the cur-
vature r in (212). in d=3, spinor indices take two values and therefore r
is proportional to the d=3 charge conjugation matrix . the appropriate
choice is

i
4

b   ,

where

r = 

 = k  k exp izy .

(266)

(267)

with the aid of the involutive automorphism   , s  s the
system (208)-(212) can be truncated to the one with the elds w and b
independent of  and s linear in ,

w (z, y; 1,2, k,|x) = w (z, y; 1,2, k|x), b(z, y; 1,2, k,|x) = b(z, y; 1,2, k|x),
(268)
(269)

s(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) = s(z, y; 1,2, k|x) .

it is this reduced system that describes higher spin interactions of matter elds
in d=3 34. for this system one nds taking into account (110), (263), and (267)
that

and

  w = w   ,

  b = b   ,

  s = s   .

(270)

(271)

the additional minus sign in (271) is due to the factor of  in (269). we
observe that for d=3 the relations (212) have a form of the deformed oscillator
relations (37) with b playing a role of the central element .

let us note that in this section we assume that the dierentials dz com-
mute with all variables except for themselves and the space-time dierentials
dxn to which they anticommute. an alternative formulation applied to the
d=4 analysis in the section 8.2 is to require dz to anticommute with the
klein operator k. clearly, this is equivalent to the substitution dz  dz.
note that the parameter  = (z, y; 1,2, k|x) of the higher spin gauge
transformations (222)-(224) is independent of  and therefore commutes with
. thus, the element , that appears explicitly in the constraints (212), belongs
to the center of the gauge algebra.

to elucidate the dynamical content of the system (208)-(212), one rst of
all has to nd an appropriate vacuum solution. we consider vacuum solutions
with

b0 =  ,

58

(272)

where  is some constant independent of the space-time coordinates and aux-
iliary variables. as a result, the equations (209) and (211) hold trivially and
the vacuum elds w0 and s0 have to satisfy

dw0 = w0  w0 ,

ds0 = w0  s0  s0  w0 ,
[s0, s0] = 2i(1 + ) .

(273)

(274)

(275)

for  = 0, the standard choice is s0 = z. for general , a class of
solutions of the equations (275) is found in 34. here we reproduce the following
three most important solutions

s

the ambiguity in the solutions of the equation (275) takes its origin in the
gauge transformation (224). all three solutions s
0 belong to the
same gauge equivalence class. it is not hard to see that s
0 solve (275). to
prove that ssym

0 solves (275) is more tricky 34.

0 and ssym

0 have the properties

0 and ssym

0(iz, iy; k, ) ,
(279)

and
ssym
0 (z, y; k, ) =  ssym
0 (iz, iy; k, ) .
(280)
in fact, the solution ssym
is xed by the properties (280). it is particularly
useful for the analysis of truncations of the system being invariant under the

0 (z, y; k, ), ssym

0 (z, y; k, ) = issym

0

59

discrete symmetries and reality conditions. when the analysis is independent
of the particular form of a vacuum solution the symbol s0 will be used for
any one of them.

now, let us turn to the equation (274). since ds0 = 0, we get

[w0, s0] = 0 .

(281)

thus, w0 belongs to the subalgebra as  a spanned by elements which
commute to s0, i.e. as is the centralizer of s0. for the case of  = 0, as
is the subalgebra of functions independent of z. to nd as for general  we
construct generating elements y commuting with s
(277).
the nal result is 34

remarkably, y again obey the commutation relations of the form (37) but
now with the klein operator k instead of 

[y, y] = 2i(1 + k) ,

yk = ky .

(284)

it is elementary to check that [y

vacuum solution characterized by the parameter . one can now choose ads3
solution of the vacuum equations (208) in the form (131) identifying  e.g.
with 1,

w0 =

1

8i (cid:0)(x){y(), y()} + h(x)1{y(), y()}(cid:1) .

(286)

this completes the construction of the background solution. let us emphasize
that the form of the constraint (212) leads in a rather non-trivial way to the
ads background geometry via realization of the vacuum centralizer as in
terms of the deformed oscillators y.

once a vacuum solution is known, one can study the system (208)-(212)

perturbatively expanding the elds as

b = b0 +b1 +. . . ,

s = s0 +s1 +. . . ,

w = w0 +w1 +. . . . (287)

substitution of these expansions into (208)-(212) gives in the lowest order

d0 w1 = 0 ,

d0 c = 0 ,

d0 s1 = [w1 , s0] ,

[s0 , s1]  [s0 , s1] = 2i c   ,

[s0 , c] = 0 ,

(291)

(292)

where we denote c = b1 and d0 is the background covariant derivative.

the system (288)-(292) is analyzed as follows. from (292), one concludes
that c has a form analogous to (285), i.e. c = c(y; 1,2, k|x). expanding c
as
(293)

c = caux(y; 1, k|x) + cdyn(y; 1, k|x)2 ,

with

one observes that the covariant derivative d0 acts dierently on caux and cdyn
because the factor 1 that appears in the vacuum solution (286) anticommutes
to 2. as a result, the equation (289) in the sector of cdyn turns out to be
equivalent to the equation (134). from the analysis of the section 6.3 we
conclude that cdyn describes four spin 0 and four spin 1/2 matter elds with
the masses given in (184) and (185). the overall doubling for each mass is due
to 1 while the doubling with the mass splitting in the boson sector is due to
k (cf (186)). altogether, matter elds form a d3 massive hypermultiplet with
respect to the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra osp(2, 2)  osp(2, 2) discussed in
the section 3.
in the sector of caux, the covariant derivative acts as in the adjoint rep-

resentation of the deformed oscillator algebra,

d0caux = dcaux  w0  caux + caux  w0 .

(296)

an important dierence between the adjoint representation and twisted rep-
resentation is that the set of equations for caux decomposes into an in-
nite set of nite subsets of equations for homogeneous polynomials, i.e.
for
cauxa b1...n (x) with any xed n. this is a simple consequence of (40). (the
equations for cdyn contain a nite set of innite subsystems, each describing
a matter eld.) because c = caux(y; 1, k|x0) plays a role of initial data
in the pure gauge solution of the covariant constancy conditions we conclude
33,42 that each of the subsystems contained in caux describes at most a nite
number of degrees of freedom. moreover, because the ads3 algebra o(2, 2)
is noncompact, these degrees of freedom cannot appear in a unitary theory,
ruled out by appropriate boundary conditions. as a result, caux describes
some topological elds which carry no degrees of freedom in the unitary case.
the next step consists of resolution of the constraints (291) to reconstruct
the auxiliary eld s1 as a linear functional of c, s1 = s1(c), up to a gauge
ambiguity. then, (290) allows one to express a part of degrees of freedom in
w1 via c, while the rest modes, which belong to the kernel of the mapping
[s0 , . . .], remain free. these free modes are again arbitrary functions of y,
i.e. w1 = (y; 1,2, k|x) + w1(c), where (y; 1,2, k|x) corresponds to the
higher spin gauge elds. the dynamical equations on them are imposed by
eq. (288) after (290) is solved. eq. (288) describes the c-dependent rst-order
corrections to the higher spin strengths for , which are argued in the section 9
to vanish 34. as a result one arrives at the d3 central on-mass-shell theorem
(183).

one proceeds analogously in the highest orders. the equations (288)-(292)

are consistent and admit a perturbative solution in powers of c and .

62

8.4

interaction ambiguity

historically, we arrived at the equations for d=4 higher spin elds via perturba-
tive analysis of the higher spin free dierential algebra. in the end, the system
of equations self-organized into the compact form (208)-(212) and (238). in
this section we focus on some general features underlying this construction
which hopefully will be useful for the analysis of higher spin systems in dif-
ferent dimensions and have already been applied for the d=3 33,34 and d=2 64
systems.

in principle, there are two ways for possible generalizations of the equations
(208)-(212): a generalization of the equations within the same set of elds w, b
and s or modications by using larger sets of elds. the latter problem, being
quite interesting in the context of the o-mass-shell (lagrangian) formulation
of the higher spin theories, is not yet enough claried and is not discussed here.
within the set of the variables w, b and s the most interesting question

is why r has the particular form (238). one can generalize (212) to

ss =i[dz dz(g(b)+f (b))+dz dz ( g(b)+ f (b))+dzdz
with arbitrary complex functions g(b) and f (b) and hermitian h (b)

h (b)]
(297)

h  = h 

(298)

being some star-product expansions analogous to (239). this form of r is
consistent with x and z bianchi identities provided that the rest equations
(208)-(211) are true. the term with h  was not considered in 14 since it looks
weird breaking down lorentz invariance explicitly (because it is impossible to
construct a vector from a scalar eld b without introducing some exterior
vector). note that since  and  anticommute with dz and dz , they can
only appear in the dzdz and dzdz sectors, respectively (otherwise the system
becomes inconsistent).

the ambiguity in g(b) is articial within the perturbative analysis in
powers of b provided that g(0) 6= 0. indeed, one can get rid of the dependence
on g by means of the following eld redenition which does not aect the
equations (208)-(211)

s  s = [g(b)] 1

2 dzs + [ g(b)] 1

2 dz s  .

we therefore set g = 1.

one can also use the ambiguity in the invertible eld redenitions

b  b = f (b) .

63

(299)

(300)

in particular, if f (b) is some real function, f (b) = f (b), one can choose f (b)
to coincide with the inverse of f (b), thus reducing the problem to the case
with f (b) = f (b) = b. however, generally, f (b) is some complex function
of b , while f (b) is real, f (b) = f (b), because b itself is real in accordance
with the reality conditions (236). assuming that f (b) starts with the linear
term f1b one can x this freedom by requiring that f (b) f (b) = b b and,
therefore
(301)

f (b) = b exp[i(b)] ,

f (b) = b exp[i(b)] ,

where (b) is an arbitrary real function of b. note that one cannot use eld
redenitions mixing s and s  because of the properties of the klein operators
 and . therefore, we are left with the formula (297) with g = 1, f (b) of
the form (301) and arbitrary h (b).

let us now discuss the question of lorentz invariance of the higher spin
equations. the gauge transformations (224) act on the spinor variables z  but
not on the exterior index  of s. moreover, there is no local symmetry at all
rotating this indexe. the generators of the lorentz symmetry acting on the
spinor variables are

ltot

 =

i
4

({z, z}  {y, y}) ,

ltot

  =

i
4

({z , z }  {y , y }) . (302)

actually, by (100) and (101), the innitesimal local lorentz transformations

f = [ltot

 , f ] + [   ltot

  , f ]

(303)

with the parameter (x) rotate properly the spinor generating elements,

z = 2

z ,

y = 2

y ,

z  = 2 

 z  ,

 y  = 2 

 y  .

(304)

although the system (208)-(212) is invariant under the local lorentz transfor-
mations (303) (not acting on the outer spinor index in s), this symmetry is
spontaneously broken due to the constraint (212) because the r.h.s. of (212)
has a non-vanishing vacuum value and therefore s itself must have a non-
vanishing vacuum expectation value as is manifested by the vacuum solution
(246).

as explained in the section 8.1 the global symmetry identies with the
centralizer of the vacuum value s0 (246) isomorphic to the star-product algebra

ein that respect, there is some dierence between non-commutative gauge elds s and
base-space dierential forms dxnwn possessing dieomorphisms rotating the form index n.

the generators bilinear in y and y 

lgl
 = 

i
4{y, y} ,

lgl
 

i
4{y , y } .

= 

(305)

by its denition, the full global symmetry acts properly in all orders in in-
teractions. in particular this is true for the ads subalgebra spanned by the
bilinears in y and y  and its lorentz part (305). so, we conclude that the
higher spin eld equations with arbitrary g, f and h  possess global lorentz
symmetry. this happens because this global symmetry leaves invariant s0 and
does not act on the indices carried by h .

the situation with local symmetries is dierent because, as is known from
the example of supergravity 62, their form is deformed by curvature-dependent
terms compared to the global symmetry algebra.
in particular, ads trans-
lations acquire some curvature-dependent corrections which transform them
into dieomorphisms. the local lorentz symmetry remains undeformed how-
ever, with the lorentz connection entering only via the usual lorentz covariant
derivatives. the local lorentz symmetry guarantees the equivalence between
the cartan (frame) and the riemanian formulations of gravity, providing the
meaningful interpretation of spinors and tensors. it is therefore reasonable to
require the higher spin equations to have standard (undeformed) local lorentz
symmetry. surprisingly, this simple requirement is highly restrictive and to
large extend xes a form of the higher spin equations.

the question is whether there exists a local lorentz symmetry which ro-
tates properly spinor indices of the dynamical elds identied with the initial
data (206) without a contradiction with the constraints (211) and (212) in all
orders of perturbations. the answer is that this is indeed true provided that
h  = 0.

indeed, for the curvature r (238) with h  = 0, the constraints (212),
(211) have a form of the deformed oscillator algebra (37) in the dotted and
undotted sectors. as a result, the elements

m =

i
4{s, s}

(306)

obey the lorentz commutation relations and rotate properly s,

[m , s] = s + s ,

[m , s ] = 0 .

(307)

analogously,

m   =

i
4{s , s }
65

(308)

obey the lorentz commutation relations and rotate properly s ,
[ m   , s] = 0 .

[ m   , s ] =    s  +    s  ,

(309)

now we require that the gauge xings used to reconstruct s in terms of
b (i.e. of the type we have used to gauge away 1 in (252)) do not contain
any exterior objects transforming as nontrivial representations of the lorentz
group. in other words s (z; y ) is required to be reconstructed in terms of
c(y ) = b(0; y ) only by using z and y . from the analysis of the section
(8.2) it is clear that this can be achieved in all orders in interactions.

let us dene

l = ltot

  m ,

l   = ltot

   m  

(310)

with l and l   to be identied with the generators of the local lorentz
transformations acting on the physical elds. taking into account (211), we
obtain

b = [l , b] = [ltot

 , b] ,

(311)

i.e. l rotates properly the eld b.
for the gauge elds w we have

w = d(l) = (d )l + [ltot

 , w ] .

(312)

here d(f ) = df  [w, f ] and therefore d() = d(), since (x) is
proportional to the unit element of the star-product algebra. also, d(l) =
[ltot
 = 0 and dm = 0 (cf. eq.(210)). from (312) one
concludes that the gauge eld for a true local lorentz symmetry is

, w ] because dltot

wl = 

l l ,

(313)

while the other gauge elds are rotated properly under the local lorentz trans-
formations. (the analysis in the sector of dotted spinors is analogous.)

by assumption, the auxiliary eld s is expressed via b by the constraint

(212) in a lorentz covariant way. we therefore have

[ltot

 , s(b)] =  (s(b) + s(b)) +

s(b)

b

b ,

(314)

[ltot

 , s (b)] =

s (b)

b

b ,

where b = [ltot

, b]. making use of (307), we nd

s = [l , s] =

s
b

b .

66

(315)

(316)

as a result, the local lorentz rotations generated by l and l   do not act on
the index  of s , acting only on the physical elds b. this is just the desired
result that the transformation law respects the solution of the constraints for
s in terms of b.

thus, the fact that the constraints (212), (211) have a form of the deformed
oscillator algebra (37) guarantees that the local lorentz symmetry remains
unbroken. this property restricts a form of the curvature r ruling out the
term with h . we conclude that, modulo perturbative eld redenitions,
the most general form of the curvature r compatible with local lorentz
invariance is (238) with f (b) of the form (301).

beyond the perturbative analysis, the most general form of the equation

(212) compatible with local lorentz invariance is

(317)

s  s = i[dz dz(g(b) + f (b)  ) + dz dz ( g(b) + f (b)  )] .
in principle, the theory may admit phases with dierent behavior of the func-
tions g and f . one interesting possibility is g(0) = 0. the straightforward
interpretation in terms of ads higher spin elds is not obvious for that case
but it may correspond to the w limit of the underlying algebras 32 having
therefore some relevance to conformal models. similar statement concerns the
strong coupling limit f (b)   equivalent to g(b)  0 by a rescaling of s.
the meaning of the ambiguity in one real function (b) which aects
higher spin interactions is not yet clear. for general , some discrete sym-
metries of the system turn out to be lost. for more details on this issue we
refer the reader to the original paper 14. note that even the simplest choice
(b) = 0 is interesting enough leading to consistent nontrivial higher spin
dynamics.

the analysis of the d=3 case is parallel to d=4. the constraint (212)
associated with r (266) again has a form of the deformed oscillator algebra
(37) thus guaranteeing local lorentz invariance. there is no ambiguity in the
function (b) because the elds are real and, perturbatively, all nonlinearities
in r can be compensated by eld redenitions analogous to (299) and (300).
beyond the perturbative analysis, the most general form of the equation (212)
is

s  s = idz dz(g(b) + f (b)  ) .

(318)

the d=3 equations are very close to the d = 4 self-dual higher spin equa-
tions introduced in 14. indeed, it is the minkowski signature (+  ) that
forces the left and right sectors to be conjugated to each other. for the signa-
tures (  ) and (+ + ) these sectors are independent. for that reason,
for the cases admitting selfduality, the functions f (b) and f (b) are no longer

67

conjugated to each other but become independent real functions. one can
therefore set

(319)
or vice versa. (for f (b) = 0 one can achieve f (b) = b by the eld redenition
(300).)

f (b) = b

f (b) = 0 ,

note that in the standard selfduality equations a half of (higher spin) weyl
tensors (eld strengths in the spin 1 case) vanishes. in the self-dual higher
spin equations of the form (319) the situation is dierent because all higher
spin weyl tensors are still contained in the generating function b(0; y ; k, k|x).
however a half of the weyl tensors decouples from the higher spin curvatures
(i.e. only another half of them survive in (166)). it is interesting to clarify
a relationship of this form of the self-dual higher spin equations with that
proposed in 65.

9 integrating flow

an interesting property of the d=3 equations (208)-(212) is 34 that they admit
a ow which expresses solutions of the full system in terms of free elds. since
we use the perturbation expansion in powers of the physical elds identied
with the deviation c(y ; q|x) = b(0; y ; q|x) from its vacuum value , let us
introduce a formal perturbation expansion parameter  as follows

b() =  + b() .

(320)

simultaneously, the rest of the elds acquire a formal dependence on , i.e.
w = w () and s = s(). the d=3 system takes a form

dw = w  w ,

db = w  b  b  w ,

s  s = 2i(1 +  + b  ) , s  b = b  s .

ds = w  s  s  w , (321)
(322)

the parameter  drops out all the equations except for the non-commutative
curvature in (322). as a result, the expansion in powers of  is equivalent to
the expansion in powers of the curvature uctuations.

now, one observes that for the limiting case  = 0 the system (321), (322)

reduces to the free one. indeed, setting

b|=0 = b1  c ,

w|=0 = w0  w , s|=0 = s0 ,

(323)

we see that at  = 0 the system (321), (322) solves in terms of s = s0
with the gauge eld w = w(y(); 1,2, k|x) satisfying the vacuum equations
dw = w  w, and b = c(y(); 1,2, k|x) satisfying the free eld equations

68

(289). this is similar to contractions of lie algebras. for all values of  6= 0,
the systems of equations (321), (322) are pairwise equivalent since the eld
redenition (320) is non-degenerate. on the other hand, although the eld
redenition (320) degenerates at  = 0, eqs. (321), (322) still make sense for
 = 0, describing the free eld dynamics.

remarkably, the two inequivalent systems turn out to be related by the

following ow with respect to :

(326)

where  is an arbitrary parameter. by applying 
 to the both sides of
eqs.(321), (322) one concludes that for any  the system (324)-(326) is com-
patible with (321), (322). therefore, solving (324)-(326) with the initial data
(323) satisfying the free equations of motion we can express solutions of the full
nonlinear system at  = 1 via solutions of the free system at  = 0. note that
all elds acquire nontrivial dependence on the parameter  via the deformed
oscillators (282) or (283).

this approach is very ecient at least perturbatively and allows one to
derive the corresponding nonlinear eld redenitions order by order. in par-
ticular, using this ow, one easily proves 34 that the d3 higher spin gauge eld
strengths do not admit nontrivial sources linear in elds. this is of course
expected result because, in accordance with the d3 central on-mass-shell
theorem (183), d3 higher spin elds do not admit weyl tensors. neverthe-
less, even at the linearized level it is a complicated technical problem to nd a
form of an appropriate eld redenition for arbitrary  without using the ow
(324)-(326).

the ows (324)-(326) at dierent  develop within the same gauge equiv-
alence class. to see that any variation of  is induced by some gauge transfor-
mation one has to nd such a gauge parameter  that

w


= d ,

b


= [ , b] ,

s


= [ , s] ,

|=0 = 0 ,

(327)

where d = d  [w , ]. the compatibility condition of (327) with (324)-
(326) is satised if

(328)

69

which condition just xes the -dependence of . thus, one is free to choose
any value of .

one has to be careful in making statements on the locality of the mapping
induced by the ow (324)-(326). indeed, although it does not contain explic-
itly space-time derivatives, it contains them implicitly via highest components
c(n) of the generating function c(y) which are identied with the highest
derivatives of the matter elds according to (189). for example, the equation
(325) at  = 0 in the zero order in  reads


b1(z, y) = c(y) 

c(y)



.

(329)

because of nonlocality of the star-product, for each xed rank multispinorial
component of the left hand side of this formula there appears, in general, an
innite series involving bilinear combinations of the components c(n) with
all n on the right hand side of (329). therefore, in accordance with (190),
the right hand side of (329) eectively involves space-time derivatives of all
orders, i.e. the transformation laws (324)-(326) can eectively describe some
nonlocal transformation. this means that we cannot treat the system (321),
(322) as locally equivalent to the free system. instead we can only claim that
there exists a nonlocal mapping between the free and nonlinear system. this
mapping is reminiscent of the nicolai mapping in supersymmetric models 66.
at the linearized level, however, the transformations induced by the inte-
grating ow (324)-(326) are local for the following simple reason. in this case,
all eld redenitions are linear in the matter elds c and only the zero-order
(vacuum) part w0 of the higher spin gauge elds w contributes. since the
background gravitational 1-forms (131) are bilinear in the auxiliary variables
y, the transformations for physical elds, induced by (324), contain at most
two derivatives in y. in accordance with (190), this is equivalent to the state-
ment that the linearized eld transformations contain only a nite number of
space-time derivatives and therefore are local. thus, the fact that the equa-
tions of motion for higher spin elds do not acquire sources linear in the matter
elds is the well-dened local statement. this is not expected to be true for
the second-order analysis of bilinear higher spin currents constructed from the
matter elds.

in fact, the 2-forms j(c) dual to currents of an arbitrary spin constructed

from massless matter elds in ads3 are shown in 26 to be exact

in the class of innite expansions in powers of derivatives (i.e. with u (c)
depending on all components of c(y )), thus explaining how a nonlocal eld

j(c) = du (c)

(330)

70

redenition induced by the ow (324)-(326) can compensate higher spin current
interactions of matter elds

r1  dw = j(c) .

(331)

let us stress that this phenomenon has no analog in the at space.

the existence of the integrating ow (324) takes its origin in the simple
fact that b behaves like a constant in the system (208)-(212): it commutes to
s and satises the covariant constancy condition. knowledge of the vacuum
solution with b =  can therefore be used to reconstruct the full dependence
on b. indeed, the meaning of (324) is that a derivative with respect to b is the
same as that with respect to . since the parameter  can be interpreted as the
coupling constant, the idea to integrate the higher spin equations by integrating
a ow with respect to  has much in common with the coupling constant
evolution method developed in 67 in application to quantum mechanics.

one can proceed analogously in the d=4 case by the substitution

f (b) =  + f (b) ,

f (b) =  +  f (b)

(332)

in (238) or, equivalently, reintroducing nonzero f0 =  and f0 = . this leads
to the two ows commuting with the system (208) and to each other,

for x = w , s or b.

for the rst sight the existence of the d=4 ows is paradoxical because
it establishes a connection between the full nonlinear problem and the free
system with only vacuum elds in the sector of gauge elds w . that was ne
for the chern-simons d=3 higher spin dynamics but sounds surprisingly for
the d=4 case. indeed, let us discuss the example of einstein gravity. einstein
equations (155), (156) can be rewritten as

c1212 ,

r  = 0, r12 = h1   h2

2 c 1 2 1 2
,
(335)
where the parameter  is introduced in a way it comes from the system (208)-
(212). in the limit  = 0, einstein equations therefore reduce to the vacuum
equations of the ads space. the dynamical equations of the massless spin
2 eld reappear as equations on the weyl tensor described by the covariant

r 1 2

= h 1  h

71

constancy equation (158) and (159), (equivalently by (209)). to understand
how this free vacuum system is related to the nonlinear one with  6= 0, one
has to take into account the dierence between the d=3 and d=4 problems
discussed in the end of the section 5.

for d=3, the ansatz (131) describes the vacuum solution with the same
ads3 gravitational elds (x) and h(x) for arbitrary . therefore, the
dierentiation with respect to  in the d=3 case when using the ow to iterate
solutions will only act on the deformed oscillators (282) or (283) but not on
the space-time dependent coecients in (131) identied with the background
gravitational elds. as a result, implementation of the integration ow in d=3
has a form of some (may be eectively nonlocal) eld redenition.

the d=4 ansatz (132) only describes ads geometry for the case of  =  =
0. for  6= 0 it does not solve the vacuum equations. therefore, in the d=4 case
one rst of all has to nd a true vacuum solution w0(, ) of the problem with
 6= 0 and  6= 0, such that w0(0, 0) reduces to the ads4 solution. from the fact
that (132) is inconsistent away from  =  = 0 it follows that the dependence
on the space-time coordinates xn and spinor coordinates z and y is mixed
nontrivially in such a vacuum solution.
|=0 does not
express directly via the ads4 gravitational elds identied with w0(x)|=0 as
was the case for d=3. as a result, the d=4 ow describes a change of variables
explicitly containing some functions of space-time coordinates (via w0(x)
),
which depend on a particular gauge choice and cannot be directly expressed
via the background gravitational elds. therefore, in d=4, the integration ow
generates not a eld redenition but some change of variables containing an
explicit dependence on the space-time coordinates. the d=4 eld transform
induced by the ow is nonlocal even at the linearized level. the conclusion
therefore is that the ows (333), (334) indeed allow one to solve the nonlinear
system in terms of the free system via some expansion of the form

in particular, w0(x)





w = w0 + 1(x)c + 22(x)c2 + . . .

(336)

in particular, such an expansion reconstructs the metric tensor in terms of
the curvature tensor and in that sense is analogous to the normal coordinate
expansion. in d=3 the coecients n(x) express locally via the metric tensor.
thus the integration ow in d=4 higher spin system provides a systematic
way for the derivation of the coecients of the expansions like (336). the
resulting procedure is pure algebraic at any given order in  (equivalently c).
in particular, it can be used 53 to reconstruct the potentials w1 corresponding
to solutions of the free eld equations described in the section 6.2.

note that the fact that some system can be integrated order by order with
the help of a nonlocal change of variables is rather trivial. what is special

72

about the higher spin systems is that such changes of variables are described
in a systematic and constructive way by a simple ow with respect to an
additional evolution parameter.

10 conclusions

higher spin gauge theories are based on the innite-dimensional higher spin
symmetries. their role in the higher spin theories is as fundamental the role of
the supersymmetry algebra discovered by golfand and likhtman 1 for super-
symmetric theories. the higher spin symmetries are realized by the algebras
of oscillators carrying spinorial representations of the space-time symmetries.
these star-product algebras are nonlocal in the auxiliary spinor spaces in the
usual quantum-mechanical sense typical for the moyal product. one point il-
lustrated in this contribution is that the dynamical higher spin eld equations
transform this nonlocality into nonlocality in the space-time coordinates, i.e.
the quantum mechanical nonlocality of the higher spin algebras may imply
some space-time nonlocality of the higher spin gauge theories at the interac-
tion level. the same time the higher spin gauge theories remain local at the
linearized level.

another important implication of the star-product origin of the higher spin
algebras is that the space-time symmetries are simple (semisimple for d=3) and
therefore correspond to ads geometry rather than to the at one. the space-
time symmetries are realized in terms of bilinears in spinor oscillators according
to the well-known isomorphisms o(2, 2)  sp(2; r)  sp(2; r) and o(3, 2) 
sp(4; r). this phenomenon has two consequences. on the one hand, it explains
why the theory is local at the linearized level. the reason is that bilinears in
the non-commuting auxiliary coordinates can lead to at most two derivatives
in the star-products. on the other hand, the fact that higher spin models
require ads geometry is closely related to their potential nonlocality at the
interaction level because it allows expansions with arbitrary high space-time
derivatives, in which the coecients carry appropriate (positive or negative)
powers of the cosmological constant xed by counting of dimensions. as a
result, higher spin symmetries link together such seemingly distinct concepts as
ads geometry, space-time nonlocality of interactions and quantum mechanical
nonlocality of the star-products in auxiliary spinor spaces. taking into account
the recent developments related to the role of the ads space 6 and star-product
3,4,5 in the string theory this triple looks too natural to be just a coincidence.
another consequence of the star-product origin of the higher spin symmetries
is that higher spin theories are based on the associative structure rather than
on the lie-algebraic one. as a result, higher spin gauge theories with non-

73

abelian symmetries classify in a way analogous to the chan-paton symmetries
in oriented and non-oriented strings.

the algebraic structures underlying dynamical systems associated with
innite sets of higher spin gauge elds turn out to be interesting and deep. the
full geometric understanding is still lacking however. the parallelism with the
fedosov quantization is very suggestive in that respect, although higher spin
gauge theories involve spinor oscillators instead of the vector ones used in 60.
the analysis of this issue may be useful to shed light on a relationship with
the non-commutative yang-mills regime 5 in string theory.
