abstract

in connection with the question of color connement the origin of the goto-imamura-
schwinger term has been studied with the help of renormalization group. an emphasis has
been laid on the dierence between theories with and without a cut-o.

1 introduction

field theory is full of ghosts and bugs, and we have to bring divergences, anomalies and ambi-
guities under control. among others we shall concentrate on the origin of the so-called goto-
imamura-schwinger (gis) term1,2) in eld theory, since it bears a close connection with the
question of color connement35).

in evaluating the equal-time commutator (etc) between two local operators we sometimes
encounter a result in conict with that obtained by a naive application of the canonical com-
mutation relations (ccrs). the deviation from the naive expectation is referred to as the
goto-imamura-schwinger (gis) term hereafter. such a term does not arise, however, when we
evaluate the etc between two fundamental elds, and it indicates that the origin of the gis
term must be sought in the denition of the singular product of eld operators at the same
space-time point.

1

in many examples it is possible to nd a renormalization group (rg) equation controlling
the gis term in question, but then the next question is raised of how to formulate the initial
or boundary condition for this equation. in the rg approach we introduce running parameters
such as the running coupling constant and they tend to the bare or nonrenormalized ones in
the high energy limit provided that we introduce a cut-o in the unrenormalized version of the
theory as we shall see in sec. 2. then we can introduce boundary conditions in the high energy
limit into the cut-o theory by assuming the ccrs. in some cases it is possible to formulate
the boundary condition kinematically, namely, without reference to the dynamics of the system
but often it is necessary to refer to the dynamics of the system by evaluating higher order
corrections. in sec. 3 we shall illustrate these statements in quantum electrodynamics (qed).
then, we nd that the origin of the gis terms may be attributed to one of the following causes:
(1) operator-mixing under renormalization3,5), (2) non-local character of the product of eld
operators at the same space-time point and (3) divergences induced by lifting the cut-o. in
sec. 4 we shall proceed to quantum chromodynamics (qcd) in connection with the question of
color connement.

2 renormalization group

in introducing the rg approach68) we shall employ the neutral scalar theory for illustration.
we assume the quartic interaction of the scalar eld (x) with the coupling constant g. the
unrenormalized green function is given by

g(n)

0 (x1, ..., xn) = h0|t h(0)(x1)    (0)(xn)i |0i ,

(2.1)

where the subscript 0 and the superscript (0) denote unrenormalized quantities. the fourier
transform of the renormalized n-point green function is denoted by

g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g(), ) ,

(2.2)

where  denotes the renormalization point dened below and g() the running coupling constant
dened at the renormalization point as seen from

(p2 + m2)g(2)(p2; g(), ) = 1 ,

for p2 = 2 ,

g(4)

conn(p1, ..., p4; g(), )

= g()

4

yi=1

g(2)(p2

i ; g(), )  (p1,    , p4; g(), ) ,

(p1,    , p4; g(), ) = 1 ,

for pi  pj =

2
3

(4ij  1) ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

where g(4)
conn denotes the 4-point green function for connected feynmann diagrams alone. these
are the normalization conditions for the green functions and specify the renormalization point
in the pauli metric.

2

the generator of the rg is given by

d = 




+ (g)


g

,

and the rg equation for the n-point green function is given by

[d + n(g)] g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g, ) = 0 ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where we write g for g() and  denotes the anomalous dimension of the scalar eld . for
the two-point green function or the propagator we may assume the lehmann representation9),

g(2)(p2; g, ) =z d2 (2; g, )

p2 + 2  i

,

and we have

[d + 2(g)] (2; g, ) = 0 .

then eq. (2.3) in the limit    yields

(2 + m2)g(2)(2; g, )

lim


=z d2(2; g(), ) = 1 ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

in the cut-o theory where m denotes the mass of the quantum of the scalar eld.

lehmanns theorem9) on the etc for the eld operator normalized at  readily yields the

relation

(x0  y0)h(x; g, ), (y; g, )i = i4(x  y)z d2(2; g, ) ,

(2.11)

and eq. (2.10) then implies that the eld operators are identied with the unrenormalized ones
in the limit    since they satisfy the ccr. at the same time we can show that g() also
tends to the bare coupling constant g0 in the same limit.

in order to dene the running parameters we introduce

r() = exp(d) ,

(2.12)

3

where  denotes the parameter of the rg, then r() obeys the composition law

r(1)r(2) = r(1 + 2) ,

(2.13)

and the rg is literally a group identied with gl(1, r).

the running parameters in the scalar theory are dened by

g() = r()  g ,

() = r()   =  exp() ,

(2.14)

(2.15)

then we readily obtain

r() g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g, ) = g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g(), ()) .

(2.16)

we dierentiate this equation with respect to  and combine it with eq. (2.7) to obtain




g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g(), ()) = r() dg(n)(p1, ..., pn; g, )

= nr()() g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g, )
= n(g()) g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g(), ()) .

(2.17)

we have to introduce a boundary condition to this dierential equation. in a cut-o theory we
may set

lim


g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g(), ) = g(n)

0 (p1, ..., pn; g0) ,

(2.18)

where g0 denotes the bare coupling constant.

by integrating eq. (2.17) we nd

g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g, ) = exp(cid:20)nz 

0

d(g())(cid:21)  g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g(), ()) .

(2.19)

in the limit    and consequently ()   we have

g(n)(p1, ..., pn; g, ) = exp(cid:20)nz 

0

d(g())(cid:21)  g(n)

0 (p1, ..., pn; g0) .

(2.20)

in a cut-o theory all the vertex corrections to g() for    tend to vanish leaving only the
bare one, namely,

4

lim


g() = lim


g() = g0 .

the fundamental eld  is multiplicatively renormalized as

(0)(x) = z 1/2

 (x) ,

(2.21)

(2.22)

where z is the renormalization constant of the scalar eld , and it is a function of g. com-
parison of eqs. (2.20) and (2.22) yields

z 1

 = exp(cid:20)2z 

0

d(g())(cid:21) .

the running renormalization constant is given by

z 1
 () = r()z 1

 (g)

= exph2r 

 d(g())i .

when z depends not only on g but also on , () must be replaced by (, ).

in a cut-o theory we have

lim


z 1

 () = 1 ,

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

but this is not true when the integral in the exponent of eq. (2.23) does not converge and as
we shall see later this feature is a possible cause of the emergence of the gis terms.

although the rg approach has been introduced for the scalar theory we can easily extend

it to gauge theories. in qed the generator of the rg is given by

d = 




+ (e)


e

 2v (e)




,

(2.26)

where  denotes the gauge parameter. the v (e) denotes the anomalous dimension of the
electromagnetic eld and is related to (e) through the ward identity

(e) = ev (e) .

(2.27)

furthermore in qcd the generator is given by

5

d = 




+ (g)


g

 2v (g, )




,

(2.28)

where g denotes the gauge coupling constant and v the anomalous dimension of the color gauge
eld. the running parameters in qcd satisfy the following equations:

dg
d
d
d

= (g) ,

= 2v (g, ) .

then we introduce their asymptotic values by

g = lim


g() ,

 = lim


() .

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

this is possible since the rg is a group gl(1, r) but not u (1). asymptotic freedom13,14) of
qcd implies

by integrating eq. (2.30) we immediately nd a sum rule,

g = 0 .

2z

dv () = ln(

dv ()(cid:21) =

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

where v ()  v (g(), ()).

in qcd it is known that  can take three possible values4,5,12)

(2.35)

where 0 is a constant which depends only on the number of quark avors. these three values
are related to the integral of v as

3 quantum electrodynamics

quantum electrodynamics is a suitable ground to exercise the analysis of the gis terms. the
lagrangian density for qed is given by

l = lem + lmatter ,

(3.1)

where the unrenormalized version of the lagrangian density for the electromagnetic eld is given
by

lem = 

1
4

f (0)
  f (0)

 + b(0)  a(0)

 +

0
2

b(0)  b(0) ,

(3.2)

where b denotes the nakanishi-lautrup auxiliary eld10) and the interactions are included in
the matter lagrangian. the resulting eld equations are given by

f (0)

 + b(0) = j (0)



,

and the renormalized version of these equations can be expressed as

a(0)


= 0b(0)

,

f + b = j ,

a = b .

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

the fundamental elds a and b as well as the gauge parameter  are renormalized multiplica-
tively,

a(0)

 = z 1/2

3 a ,

b(0) = z 1/2

3

b ,

0 = z3 .

(3.7a)

(3.7b)

(3.7c)

apparently renormalization of the composite current operator j is not multiplicative, but its
execution requires operator mixing3,5) as illustrated by

 = z 1/2
j (0)

3

or

j = z 1/2

3

(cid:2)j + (1  z 1
3 ) b(cid:3) ,
 + (1  z3) b(0)i .
hj (0)

7

(3.8a)

(3.8b)

operator mixing is one of the sources of the gis terms, and in order to illustrate this statement
we shall evaluate the etc

(x0  y0) [aj(x), j0(y)]

(3.9)

for j = 1, 2, 3. in the unrenormalized version we have

(x0  y0)ha(0)

j (x), j (0)

0 (y)i = 0 .

(3.10)

as has been mentioned before we can rely on the etcs only between two fundamental elds,
so that we shall express j in terms of a and b by using eqs. (3.5) and (3.7),

[aj(x), j4(y)] =  [aj(x), f4(y) + 4b(y)]

= z 1

j (x), kf (0)

3 ha(0)

k4 (y)i ha(0)

j (x), 4b(0)(y)i

= (z 1

3 + 1)j3(x  y)

for x0 = y0. thus we have

(x0  y0) [aj(x), j0(y)] = i(z 1

3  1)j4(x  y)

 isj4(x  y) ,

(3.11)

where s is the coecient of the gis term. in this case it is clear that the origin of the gis term
is the operator mixing. then s satises the rg equation

[d + 2v (e)] (s + 1) = [d + 2v (e)] z 1

3 = 0 ,

(3.12)

where d is given by eq. (2.26), and the running gis coecient s() satises the dierential
equation

(cid:20) 



+ 2v (e())(cid:21) (s() + 1) = 0 .

(3.13)

in a cut-o theory the gis term is absent in the unrenormalized version as expressed by eq.
(3.10), and the boundary condition for s() is given by

s() = 0 .

(3.14)

8

by combining the boundary condition (3.14) with eq. (3.13) we nd the solution

z 1

3 () = 1 + s() = exp(cid:20)2z 



dv (e())(cid:21) .

(3.15)

in the absence of the cut-o we do not know what kind of boundary condition we should impose
on s() so that we take this solution (3.15) for granted even in this case.

in qed we assume that z 1

3 = z 1

3 (0) is divergent so that we have

1 + s() = lim


exp(cid:20)2z 



dv (e())(cid:21) =  ,

(3.16)

and the boundary condition (3.14) is no longer satised in the absence of the cut-o. this
is another source of the gis terms, and the eld operators do not necessarily tend to the
unrenormalized ones in the limit    and hence    when the cut-o is lifted.

finally we shall turn our attention to the etc between two components of the current
density. this is precisely the original problem in which the gis term was recognized1,2). we
shall make use of the eld equations (3.5) to express the current density as a linear combination
of the fundamental elds, and then we can make use of the commutativity of b with f and
b itself10),

[j(x), j(y)] = [f(x) + b(x), f(y) + b(y)]

(3.17)

= [f(x), f(y)]

,

and we introduce the gis coecient s by

(x0  y0)h0| [jj(x), j0(y)] |0i = isj4(x  y) .

(3.18)

as a matter of fact, the etc on the left-hand-side of eq. (3.18) is known to be a c-number
before taking its vacuum expectation value in spinor electrodynamics15). here we are aware of
the fact that the gis term can be expressed in terms of the etc between derivatives of eld
strengths. in order to evaluate the etc by making use of the ccrs it is necessary to express
derivatives of eld strengths in terms of canonical variables by making use of canonical eld
equations. therefore, we are taking commutators between those operators that are non-local
in time and then taking the local limit. the way in which this limit is taken is dictated in the
evaluation of the higher order corrections as we shall see below.

this is in a sharp contrast to the original naive way of evaluating the commutator between
two bilinear forms of the dirac elds by making use of only the ccrs without taking the
possibility of non-locality into consideration. this gap generates the gis term.

by combining eqs. (3.17) and (3.18) we nd that the gis coecient s satises the rg

equation

9

[d + 2v (e)] s = 0 .

(3.19)

in this case we cannot give the boundary condition for this equation since it requires the in-
formation about the dynamics of the system such as the photon propagator. the lehmann
representation of the electromagnetic eld is given in the following form:

h0|t [a(x), a (y)] |0i =

i

(2)4 z d4keik(xy)df (k) ,

df  (k) =(cid:18) 

kk

k2  i(cid:19)z dm 2 (m 2; e, )

k2 + m 2  i

+ 

kk

(k2  i)2

.

then inserting this expression into eq. (3.17) we nd

s =z dm 2(m 2; e, )m 2 .

this expression certainly satises eq. (3.19) since we have

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

[d + 2v (e)] (m 2; e, ) = 0 .

(3.23)

it is clear that z 1

3

also satises eq. (3.19) since it is given by

z 1

3 =z dm 2(m 2; e, ) .

(3.24)

we may conclude that the gis terms are controlled by rg if not completely.

4 color connement in quantum chromodynamics

in qcd the gis term plays an important role in connection with color connement35). the
eld equation in qcd corresponding to eq. (3.5) is given by

f a

 ,

 + j a

 = iaa

(4.1)

where  and  denote two kinds of becchi-rouet-stora (brs) transformations11), respectively,
and the superscript a represents the color index. since we are not entering the subject of brs
transformations here we shall refer to other references35) for their denitions.

we are interested in etc

10

(x), ab

h0|t (cid:2)iaa
= (x0  y0)h0|(cid:2)iaa

= iabc j4(x  y) ,

j(y)(cid:3) |0i

or

(x0  y0)h0|(cid:2)kf a

k4(x) + j a

4 (x), ab

j(y)(cid:3) |0i

= abc j4(x  y) .

(4.2)

the constant c is gauge-dependent, and a sucient condition for color connement is the
existence of a gauge in which the following equality holds:

c = 0 .

(4.3)

in order to determine c we have to evaluate the etc in eq. (4.2), and for that purpose we
introduce the rg equation satised by c 35),

(d  2f p ) c = 0 ,

(4.4)

where d is given by eq. (2.28) and f p denotes the anomalous dimension of the faddeev-popov
ghost elds. then the renormalization constant of the ghost elds denoted by z3 also satises
the same rg equation,

(d  2f p ) z3 = 0 .

(4.5)

we are going to study the relationship between c and z3 in this section. they satisfy the same
rg equation, but their normalizations are dierent.

the unrenormalized version of eq. (4.1) reads as

ia(0)

 (x) = a(0)

 + g0(a(0)

  a(0)

 ) + j (0)



,

(4.6)

where a = a  a denotes the linear part of f and we have suppressed the color
index. the cross product denotes the antisymmetric product in the color space dened in terms
of the structure constants of the algebra su(3). when we insert the r.h.s. of eq. (4.6) into the
etc (4.2) in the unrenormalized version, we nd that only the rst term a(0)
 gives a non-
vanishing canonical commutator and the rest would give only a vanishing result provided that

11

the naive ccrs are employed. however, this is true only in a cut-o theory or in a convergent
theory and in general we should not discard the possibility of a non-vanishing gis term so that
the unrenormalized constant c0 would be given by

c0 = 1 + s .

(4.7)

the rst term is a result of the ccr and is equal to unity. thus the renormalized c is given by

c = c0 z3 = (1 + s) z3 .

(4.8)

then a question is raised of how to evaluate the gis coecient s. for this purpose we introduce
a cut-o theory and we write a() for z 1

3 (), and we shall rewrite eq. (4.7) in the form

c() = a()

(4.9)

based on the argument developed in sec. 2. in a cut-o theory the gis coecient s vanishes,
but it does not vanish when the cut-o is lifted. the running parameters c(), a() and z3()
satisfy the following dierential equations, respectively,



(cid:20) 
 2f p ()(cid:21) c() = 0 ,
+ 2v ()(cid:21) a() = 0 ,
(cid:20) 
 2f p ()(cid:21) z3() = 0 .
(cid:20) 





(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

among them the last two are renormalization constants, and they are immediately given by

a() = z 1

3 () = exp(cid:20)2z 
3 () = exp(cid:20)2z 

dv ()(cid:21) ,
df p ()(cid:21) .



z 1



we should be aware of the following relations:

z 1
3 = z 1

3 (0) ,

z 1
3 = z 1

3 (0) ,

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

then c() should be determined by solving eq. (4.10) under the boundary condition (4.9) and
we obtain

12

c() = lim


exp"2z 



dv ()  2z 



df p ()# ,

and, in particular, we have

c = lim


exp"2z 



dv ()  2z 

0

df p ()# .

(4.16)

(4.17)

from now on we lift the cut-o while keeping these formulas. with recourse to eqs. (2.34) and
(2.36) we nd that c vanishes when z 1
vanishes as claimed before35). then we may express
eq. (4.17) as

3

c = lim


exp(cid:20)2z 



dv ()(cid:21)  z3 ,

and with reference to eq. (4.8) we nd

1 + s = lim


exp(cid:20)2z 



dv ()(cid:21)

 ,
1 ,
0 ,

for  = 0
for  = 0
for  = 

=


(4.18)

(4.19)

only in the case  = 0 do we nd the vanishing gis coecient s, and this is precisely
what happens when the integration of v converges just as in the cut-o theory. now we shall
summarize the relationship between c and z3 as follows:

 ,  = 0
z3 ,  = 0
0

 = 

(4.20)

c =


as we have seen above we formulate the boundary condition for a given rg equation by
introducing a cut-o, but when the cut-o is lifted in the solution the gis term appears as a
manifestation of the divergent character of the theory.
