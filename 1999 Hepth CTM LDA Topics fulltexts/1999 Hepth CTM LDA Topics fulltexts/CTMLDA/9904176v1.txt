abstract

we extend the theory of cosmological perturbations to the case
when the matter lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the scalar
eld and its rst derivatives. in particular, this extension provides a
unied description of known cases such as the usual scalar eld and
the hydrodynamical perfect uid.
in addition, it applies to the re-
cently proposed k-ination, which is driven by non-minimal kinetic
terms in the lagrangian. the spectrum of quantum uctuations for
slow-roll and power law k-ination is calculated. we nd, for instance,
that the usual consistency relation between the tensor spectral in-
dex and the relative amplitude of scalar and tensor perturbations is
modied. thus, at least in principle, k-ination is phenomenologically
distinguishable from standard ination.

introduction. the quantum theory of cosmological perturbations is one
of the most interesting examples of quantum eld theory in an external clas-
sical eld. indeed, the spectrum of metric perturbations generated during
ination is probably the only prediction of quantum eld theory in external
elds (besides the casimir eect) which can be tested experimentally in the
near future. the quantum theory of linearized cosmological perturbations is
well developed in the case of a usual scalar eld with the standard kinetic

term and arbitrary potential, and also for a hydrodynamical perfect uid
[1]. this theory is sucient to predict the main features of the generated
spectrum for a wide class of inationary models, as long as the accelerated
expansion of the early universe is due to the potential energy of a scalar
eld. recently, however, a dierent mechanism for driving ination, called
kination, was presented in [2]. in kination, the accelerated expansion
is due to non-minimal kinetic terms in the action, and the existing theory of
cosmological perturbations does not apply. motivated by this development,
we extend here the quantum theory of cosmological perturbation to the case
of the most general local lagrangian which depends on the scalar eld and
its rst derivatives. this extension is actually quite versatile. it allows us to
describe in a unied way the old cases of the usual scalar eld and hydro-
dynamics, and it is also applicable to the new  models admitting kinetic
ination. as we shall see, some of the basic predictions for the cosmological
perturbation spectrum in k-ination can be quite dierent from the ones in
standard ination. in this paper, we shall concentrate in the derivation of the
main formal results. a detailed analysis of the perturbation spectra in phe-
nomenologically viable models k-ination will be the subject of a forthcoming
publication[3].

setup. we consider the most general local action for a scalar eld coupled

to einstein gravity, which involves at most rst derivatives of the eld,

s = 

1

16gz grd4x +z g p(x, )d4x,

where g is the determinant of the metric, r is the ricci scalar and

x =

2

g.

(1)

(2)

the lagrangian for the scalar eld is called here p because it plays the role
of pressure [2]. indeed, varying the matter lagrangian with respect to the
metric we obtain the energy momentum tensor in the form

t = ( + p)uu  pg.

(3)

where

u =

,

(2x)1/2

2

and the energy density is given by

 = 2x p,x  p.

(4)

here p,x denotes partial derivative of the lagrangian with respect to x.

we see from (3) that the lagrangian (1) can be used to describe the
potential motions of hydrodynamical uid as well as to draw a useful analogy
with hydrodynamics in the case of arbitrary lagrangian for a scalar eld.
indeed, if p depends only on x, then  = (x). in many cases the equation
(4) can be solved giving the equation of state p = p() for an isentropic
uid. for instance, if p  x n,the corresponding equation of state is p =
/ (2n  1) . in the general case, when p = p (x, ) , the pressure cannot be
expressed only in terms of , since  and x are independent. however, even
in this case the hydrodynamical analogy is still rather useful.

background. as a background we consider an expanding friedmann uni-

verse with an arbitrary spatial curvature (k = 0,1):

ds2 = dt2  a2 (t) ikdxidxk,

(5)

where the spatial metric ik can describe at, open or closed universe. two
independent equations for two unknown background variables 0 (t) and a (t)
can be written down in the familiar form

 = 3h ( + p) ,

(7)
where h  a/a is the hubble constant and a dot denotes derivative with
respect to the physical time t. for later reference it is also useful to write
down other redundant forms of these equations. substituting (6) in (7) we
immediately get

h =

k
a2  4g ( + p) .

(8)

taking into account that  = ,x x + ,  and using (7) we obtain the
following expression for the time derivative of the pressure

in deriving (13) we used the denition (2) of x and the equations (7), (10).
we also skip from here the index 0 for the background value of  (t) . these
expressions for t should be substituted into the 00 and 0i linearized einstein

the other einstein equations give no additional information. they can be

where

the linearized equations (21-22) signicantly simplify in two important cases:
a) in spatially at universe k = 0 (for an arbitrary p) and b) for hydrody-
namical matter /or scalar eld without potential (for an arbitrary k ). in
both cases the term proportional kf in (22) vanishes.

action.

in order to normalize the amplitude of quantum uctuations,
the action is needed. this can be obtained by expanding (1) to second or-
der in perturbations. after use of the constraints, this expansion is reduced
to an expression containing only the physical degrees of freedom [1]. how-
ever, those steps are rather cumbersome and in fact we do not need to pass
through them. up to an overall time independent factor, the action for
perturbations can be unambiguously inferred directly from the equations of

(25)

motion (21-22). the overall factor can then be xed comparing this action
with previously derived actions for hydrodynamical matter and scalar eld
with minimal kinetic term in k = 0 [1] as well as k 6= 0 universes [4], which
are particular cases of our general matter lagrangian. the rst order action
which reproduces the equations of motion (21-22) is

here, the laplacian should be understood as a c-number, representing the

introducing the canonical quantization variable
v = z one can rewrite the action (25) in terms of v. comparing it with the
actions obtained in the literature for various particular cases [1, 4], we infer

that bo =  + 3k. therefore the nal result is

power spectra. for the remainder of the paper, we shall restrict our at-
tention to the case k = 0. we shall be interested in calculating the spectrum
of the quantity  = v/z. this quantity is directly related to the gravitational
potential  in terms of which the uctuations of the temperature of back-
ground radiation in large angular scales are expressed as t /t  /3. in
fact, from eqs. (18-20) we immediately nd that can be expressed in terms
of the potential ,

(29)

since the nondecaying long-wavelength solution of (28) is proportional to z,
the variable  remains constant in this limit irrespectively to what happens
with the equation of state. on the other hand, the nondecaying mode of
the potential  is constant during any period where p/ is constant [1].
therefore, for this mode  = 3[( + p) / (5 + 3p)]. it is well known how to
quantize the theory with the action (27) and we skip the standard steps (see,
for instance [1]) going directly to the spectral density

this characterizes the squared dimensionless amplitude of the perturbations

(31)

which follows from (28) by substituting v  vk () exp(ikx), with initial con-
ditions corresponding to the minimal quantum uctuations of the eld v.
when c2
s changes adiabatically, these quantum uctuations can be unam-
biguously dened for those perturbations for which the potential term z/z
is small compared to c2

sk2.

during slow roll ination, the hubble rate h, as well as cs and ( + p)
change much slower than the scale factor. thus, from (26) we have z/z 
a/a  2(ha)2, where we have used ( + p)/  1. for a given wavenumber
k, the potential term in (31) can be neglected at suciently early times,
when the physical wavelength of the perturbation a/k is much smaller than
the sound horizon csh 1. in the short wavelength limit, the normalized

take the form

(ah  csk)

(32)

the potential term z/z starts to dominate after these modes cross the
sound horizon. thus the solution (32) evolves into the long wavelength
solution

vk  ckz,

(ah  csk)

(33)

where ck is a constant. this constant is found by matching both solutions in
the standard way. in the transition region, the universe can be approximated
by de sitter a  (h)1 and (31) becomes a bessel equation. with the initial
conditions given by (32) it is readily found that |ck|2 = (2cskz2
s )1, where
zs is the value of z at the moment of sound horizon crossing ( ah = csk).
substituting (33) in (30) we nd that the spectrum for long wavelength
perturbations is given by

(34)

where p l = g2 is the planckian energy density and the subscript s means
that the appropriate quantity should be calculated at the moment dened by
ah = csk. this equation reduces to the standard result for slow-roll ination
driven by a potential term (cs = 1). however, we see that in the general case
the speed of sound appears in the denominator.

the spectrum (34) depends on the wavelength because the parameters
in the right hand side are slowly varying with time, and so they will take
dierent values as each co-moving wavelength crosses the sound horizon. the

harrison-zeldovich spectrum for scalar perturbations, as it is quite often
mistakenly stated, but it predicts rather a tilted spectrum with ns < 1. the
expression (35) diers from the appropriate expression in the case of usual
ination by the term proportional to the derivative of the speed of sound,
which does not vanish in slow roll k-ination [2]. we may add therefore, that
when non-minimal kinetic terms are allowed, the possibility of locally recon-
structing the lagrangian from the power spectra meets with new obstacles.
first of all, not only the potential term has to be reconstructed. and second,
knowledge of the spectral indices does not give as much information about
the slow roll parameters as it does in standard ination.

the spectrum of tensor perturbations is given by the usual expression

where the appropriate quantities should be estimated at the moment horizon
crossing k = ah. this is not exactly the same time as the time of sound
horizon crossing, but to lowest order in the slow-roll parameters this dier-
ence is unimportant. therefore, the ratio of tensor to scalar amplitudes for
the power spectra is given by

p h

p  = 24cs(cid:18)1 +

p

(cid:19) .

the tensor spectral index is dened as

nt =

d ln p h
k

d ln k  3(cid:18)1 +

p

(cid:19) .

(37)

(38)

in standard ination (cs = 1), this spectral index and the ratio (37) are not
independent, and one has the so-called consistency relation [5] p h/p  =
8nt , which in principle can be tested against observations. however, it is
clear that this relation does not hold in k-ination. instead of that we have

p h
p  = 8csnt

(39)

thus, at least in principle, kinetic ination is phenomenologically distin-
guishable from standard ination.

when we depart from slow roll, some extra care has to be taken in com-
paring the scalar and tensor amplitudes, since as mentioned above the time

of horizon crossing is not the same as the time of sound horizon crossing. an
example is discussed in the next section.

power law k-ination. as shown in [2], a lagrangian of the form p =
g(x)2, where g is an arbitrary function, can drive a power law expansion
of the form

the solutions are characterized by x = x0 =const. where x0 is a solution
of the equation

the power exponent is given then by  = 4gg,x (x0). during power law
ination, the speed of sound is a constant c2
s =g,x/ (g,x + 2xg,xx). this
constant is unrelated to the power exponent, and so we can think of  and cs
as parameters which can be freely adjusted by taking an appropriate function
g. in particular, one can easily write down a lagrangian for which cs > 1.
this interesting possibility will be discussed in more detail later.

it is clear from (26) that z is just proportional to the scale factor a.
reexpressing the scale factor in terms of conformal time  and substituting
it in (31) we obtain the bessel equation for vk

where  = (3/2) + (  1)1. in what follows, we shall restrict attention to
inationary solutions  > 1.
up to an irrelevant constant phase, the positive frequency solution
 (kcs) reduces to (32) in the short wavelength limit

vk = (1/2)()1/2h (1)

the right hand side of this equation is independent of time, and so we can
evaluate it at any convenient time.
it is customary to evaluate it at the
time 1 when a ducial commoving wavenumber k1 crosses the cosmological

(43)

scalar and tensor perturbations have the same power dependence in k and
the spectral index nt = 2/ (  1) doesnt depend on the wavelength.
note that their relative normalization depends on the speed of sound, and
that (42) and (43) reduce to the slow roll results in the limit of large  (or
small nt ).

discussion.

in this paper we have developed the quantum theory of
cosmological perturbations for the case of scalar eld with a lagrangian
which is an arbitrary local function of scalar eld and its rst derivatives.
the formalism has been derived in sucient generality to cover at as well as
closed and open universes. the theory gives a unied treatment of some of
the previously studied cases, which are reformulated in a language somewhat
closer to hydrodynamics, covering also the new important case of kination.
this type of ination is driven by non-minimal kinetic terms, whose origin
can be motivated by considering the low energy eective action of string
theory.

as an application, we have found general expressions for the power spec-
trum in the case of slow roll and power law k-ination. in particular, we nd
that the consistency relation between the tensor spectral index and the
relative amplitude of tensor and scalar perturbations in k-ination is dier-
ent from the usual one in standard inationary models. thus, in principle,
k-ination is phenomenologically distinguishable from the usual potential-
driven ination. also, as it was mentioned above, the speed of sound cs in
power law ination can be adjusted to any given value. this opens a new
interesting possibility. namely, one can build an inationary model where
the tensor modes dominate over the scalar modes, a prediction which can be
conrmed or ruled out in future observations. however, as we see from (43),
this is only possible when the speed of sound cs exceeds the speed of light.
since this is a very interesting and rather exotic possibility, we would like to
conclude with some speculative remarks on this topic.

first of all, let us note that the theory we consider is perfectly lorenz
invariant, but strongly nonlinear. in this case, it has been known for a long
time that the propagation of signals with the speed bigger than the speed

11

of light is rather generic than exceptional and does not contradict to general
principles [6] (incidentally, one expects that this phenomenon should also oc-
cur in string theories, which predict the born-infeld type action.) returning
now to the model of power law ination, we see that a lagrangian of the
form p = p(x)2 can drive power law expansion with an arbitrary equation
of state. in particular, the scalar eld could play the role of a quintessential
component in the universe with p < 0. in this case too the parameters can
be arranged so that cs > 1. therefore it doesnt seem to be excluded that we
may one day be able to communicate with distant civilizations in an ecient
manner by exchanging waves of quintessence. these speculative ideas clearly
require further investigation [7].
