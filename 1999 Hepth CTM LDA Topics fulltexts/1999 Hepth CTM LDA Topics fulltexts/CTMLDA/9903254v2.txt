in this lecture, a limited introduction of gauge invariance in phase-space is provided,
predicated on canonical transformations in quantum phase-space. exact characteristic tra-
jectories are also specied for the time-propagating wigner phase-space distribution function:
they are especially simpleindeed, classicalfor the quantized simple harmonic oscillator.
this serves as the underpinning of the eld theoretic wigner functional formulation intro-
duced. scalar eld theory is thus reformulated in terms of distributions in eld phase-space.
this is a pedagogical selection from work published in 1), 2), reported at the yukawa institute
workshop gauge theory and integrable models, 26-29 january, 1999.

1.

introduction

the third complete autonomous formulation of quantum mechanics, distinct
from conventional hilbert space or path-integral quantization, is based on wigners
phase-space distribution function (wf), which is a special representation of the den-
sity matrix 3), 4). in this formulation, known as deformation quantization 5), expec-
tation values are computed by integrating mere c-number functions in phase-space,
the wf serving as a distribution measure. such phase-space functions multiply each
other through the pivotal -product 6), which encodes the noncommutative essence of
quantization. the key principle underlying this quantization is the -products oper-
ational isomorphism 5) to the conventional heisenberg operator algebra of quantum
mechanics.

below, we address gauge invariance in phase-space through canonical trans-
formation to and from free systems. further, we employ the -unitary evolution
operator, a -exponential, to specify the time propagation of wigner phase-space
distribution functions. the answer is known to be remarkably simple for the har-
monic oscillator wf, and consists of classical rigid rotation in phase-space for the full
quantum system. it serves as the underpinning of the generalization to eld theory
we consider, in which the dynamics is specied through the evolution of c-number
distributions on eld phase-space. we start by illustrating the basic concepts in 2d
phase-space, without loss of generality; then, in generalizing to eld theory, we make
the transition to innite-dimensional phase-space.

even though they amount to spatial auto-correlation functions of schrodinger wave-
functions , they can be determined without reference to such wavefunctions, in
a logically autonomous structure. for instance, when the wavefunction is an en-
ergy (e) eigenfunction, the corresponding wf is time-independent and satises the
two-sided energy -genvalue equations 7), 2),

it is an exponentiation of the poisson bracket (pb) kernel, introduced by groe-
newold 6) and developed in two important papers 5). since it involves exponentials of

these wfs are real. they are bounded by the schwarz inequality 8) to 2/h 
f  2/h. they can go negative, and, indeed, they do for all but gaussian congura-
tions, negative values being a ready hallmark of interference. thus, strictly speaking,
they are not probability distributions 3). however, upon integration over x or p, they
yield marginal probability densities in p and x-space, respectively. they can also be
shown to be orthonormal 7), 2). unlike in hilbert space quantum mechanics, naive
superposition of solutions of the above does not hold, by virtue of takabayashis 9), 8)
fundamental nonlinear projection condition f  f = f /h.

anyone beyond the proverbial jaded sophisticate should value the ready intu-
ition on the shape of the wf based on the shape of the underlying conguration
(x). fix a point x0, and reect (x) around it, (x0 + (x x0)) 7 (x0 (x x0)).
then, overlap this with the starting conguration (x), to survey where the over-
lap vanishes, and where it is substantial, thereby obtaining a qualitative picture of
the support of the wf at x0. thus, eg, it is evident by inspection that the wf
f (x, p) vanishes outside the absolute outer limits of support of the underlying (x).
however, a bimodal (x) (one consisting of two separated bumps) will evidently
yield f (x, p) with nonvanishing support (interference) in the intermediate region
between the two bumps in (x), even though (x) itself vanishes there.

2. gauge systems

while the question of adapting the wf formalism to gauge systems has been
addressed in the literature 10), and interesting proposals have been made about ac-
commodating nontrivial congurations involving berrys phase 11), the problem has
still not been settled in its full generality. here, the straightforward solution for

phase-space quantization of field theory

hep-th/9903254

gauge variation limited to a merely 2d phase-space will be provided, by canonical
mapping to a free hamiltonian. this solution does not cover the more interesting
topologically nontrivial situations which arise in higher dimensions, and which still
languish in ambiguity.

for notational simplicity, take h = 1 in this section. the area element in phase-

space is preserved by canonical transformations

(x, p) 7 (x(x, p), p (x, p)) ,

(2.1)

which yield trivial jacobians (dxdp = dxdp {x, p}) by preserving the pbs,

{u, v}xp 

u
x

v
p 

u
p

v

.

(2.2)

they thus preserve the canonical invariants of their functions, {x, p}xp = 1, hence
{x, p}xp = 1. equivalently,

(2.3)

{x, p} = {x, p},

in any basis. motion being a canonical transformation, hamiltons classical equations
of motion are preserved, for h(x, p )  h(x, p), as well 12). what happens upon
quantization?
since, in deformation quantization, the hamiltonian is a c-number function, and
so transforms classically, h(x, p )  h(x, p), the eects of a canonical transforma-
tion on the quantum theory will be carried by a covariantly transformed wigner
function, not the classical transform of it that is frequently demonstrated to be un-
workable in the literature. naturally, the answer can be deduced 2) from diracs
quantum transformation theory.

consider the classical canonical transformations specied by an arbitrary gen-

erating function f (x, x):

p =

f (x, x)

x

,

p = 

f (x, x)

x

.

(2.4)

following diracs celebrated exponentiation 13) of such a generator, scrodingers en-
ergy eigenfunctions transform canonically through a generalization of the representation-
changing fourier transform. namely,

e(x) = nez dx eif (x,x) e(x) .

(2.5)

thus, the pair of wigner functions in the respective canonical variables, f (x, p) and

f(x, p ) =

1

2 z dy  (x 

y
2

) eiy p  (x +

y
2

),

are connected through a convolution by a transformation functional,

f (x, p) = z dxz dp t (x, p; x, p ) f(x, p ) .

(2.6)

(2.7)

4

c zachos and t curtright

(in proof, it has come to our attention that this equation has already been given in
ref 14)). in curtright et al. 2), this transformation functional was evaluated to be

t (x, p; x, p ) = |n|2

now consider the succession of two canonical transformations with generating
functionals f1 and f2, respectively 12), useful for generating all other classes of canon-
ical transformations,

by inspection of (2.7,2.8), it follows that the corresponding transformation func-

where the eective generator f is specied by diracs integral expression:

exp(if(x, )) =z dx exp (if1(x, x) + if2(x, )) .

(2.11)

the classical result for the concatenation of two canonical transformations would re-
quire that the exponent of the integrand does not depend on x, so that the momenta
p at the intermediate phase space point coincide. instead, quantum mechanically,
diracs celebrated result dictates integration over all intermediate points, as seen.

a succession of several intermediate points (xi, pi) integrated over naturally
generalizes to entire paths of canonical transformations; their eective generators en-
tering in (2.8) are given by the usual dirac path integral expressions generalizing the
above.
function,
f = s(x = x(ti), x = x(tf )), the action increment. thus, the generalization
yields the familiar dirac/feynman functional integral propagator. consequently,
each wavefunction in (2.6) propagates independently by its respective feynman ef-
fective action.

finally, consider the canonical transformation from the free hamiltonian h =
p2/2m to the one for a minimally coupled particle in a magnetic eld, h = ( 
ea())2/2m, in one space dimension. in the formalism outlined, this is eected by
a succession of two canonical transformations,

(x, p) 7 (x = p, p = x) 7 ( = x,  = p + ea(x)) ,

(2.12)

consequently, the eective exponentiated generator (2.11) is

generated by f1 = xx and f2 = x  er  dz a(z), respectively.
dza(z)(cid:19) .

exp(if(x, )) = 2(x  ) exp(cid:18)iez x

(2.13)

thus, the gauge-invariant eigenfunction  of the free hamiltonian transforms to the
gauge-variant eigenfunction  of the em hamiltonian,

hence, the transformation functional (2.8) reduces to

(x) = eier x

dza(z)  (x) .

(2.14)

t (x, p; x, p ) =

1

2 z dy exp iy (p  p )  iez x+y /2

xy /2

dza(z)! (x x). (2.15)

as a result, the free-particle wf canonically transforms to the gauge-invariant
one for a particle in the presence of a vector potential, already considered by 10) (with
h reinstated for completeness):

f (x, p) =

1

2 z dy  (x 

h
2

y) e

iyp(ie/h)r x+hy/2

xhy/2

dza(z)

 (x +

h
2

y).

(2.16)

of course, this gauge-invariant wf is controlled by the moyal equation (detailed in
the next section) driven by the free h, not h, which controls f instead.
the above discussion is only a starting point of setting up gauge invariance in
phase space. by contrast to this discussion, in more than one space dimensions,
the line integral of the vector potential is ambiguous, and straight paths from every
point x to all endpoints (involving y, integrated over) are inequivalent, in general,
to alternate paths in nontrivial eld settings. one should then not expect these
problems to be canonically equivalent to free ones. the motivated reader is referred
to pati 11).

3. time evolution

time-dependence for wfs was succinctly specied as ows in phase-space by

moyal through the commutator bracket 4) bearing his name,

ih


t

f (x, p; t) = h  f (x, p; t)  f (x, p; t)  h.

(3.1)

this turns out to be the essentially unique associative generalization 15) of the pb,
to which it reduces as h  0, yielding liouvilles theorem of classical mechanics,
t f + {f, h} = 0 ) .
for the evolution of the fundamental phase-space variables x and p, time evo-
lution is simply the convective part of moyals equation, so the apparent sign is

) the question was asked at the talk what generalizes the - product when redundant variables
are present, notably for dirac brackets (db); but it has not been answered. eg, on a hypersphere sn,
if the redundant variables are eliminated, one deals with simple coordinate changes for pb, as usual.

6

reversed, while the moyal bracket actually reduces to the pb. that is, the h-
dependence drops out, and these variables, in fact, evolve simply by the classical
hamiltons equations of motion, x = ph, p = xh.
what is the time-evolution of a wf like? this is the rst question answered
through the isomorphism 5) of -multiplication associative combinatorics to the par-
allel algebraic manipulations of quantum mechanical operators, which are familiar.
eqn (3.1) can be solved for the time-trajectories of the wf, which turn out to be
notably simple. by virtue of the -unitary evolution operator, a -exponential 5),

the time-evolved wigner function is obtainable formally in terms of the wigner
function at t = 0 through associative combinatoric operations completely analogous
to the conventional formulation of quantum mechanics of operators in hilbert space.
specically,

f (x, p; t) = u 1

 (x, p; t)  f (x, p; 0)  u(x, p; t).

as indicated, the dynamical variables evolve classically,

what can be said about this formal time-evolution expression? if the wf can
be written as a -function, ie a sum of -products of the phase-space variables,
then associativity will permit application of the above -similarity transformation
throughout the wfs.

any wf in phase-space, upon fourier transformation resolves to

f (x, p) = z dadb f (a, b) eiaxeibp.

(3.8)

but if, instead, the redundant variables are retained, subject to the constraint x2
n =

all exponentiation assignments of this kernel examined so far have not yielded an associative mod-

however, note that exponentials of individual functions of x and p are also -
exponentials of the same functions, or -versions of these functions, since the -
product trivializes in the absence of a conjugate variable, so that

moreover, this is proportional to a -product, since

consequently, any wigner function can be written as

f (x, p) = z dadb f (a, b) eihab/2 eiax

  eibp
 .

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

it follows then, that, by insertion of u  u 1

.

(3.12)

f (x, p; t) = z dadb f (a, b) eihab/2 eiau 1
= z dadb f (a, b) eihab/2 eiax(t)





unfortunately, in general, the above steps cannot be simply reversed to yield
an integrand of the form f (a, b) eiax(t)eibp(t). but, in some limited fortuitous
circumstances, they can, and in this case the evolution of the wigner function reduces
to merely backward evolution of its arguments x, p along classical trajectories, while
its functional form itself remains unchanged:

f (x, p; t) = f (x(t), p(t); 0) .

(3.13)

to illustrate this, consider the simple linear harmonic oscillator (taking m = 1,

 = 1),

it is easily seen that

h =

p2 + x2

x + ip

.

ih x = x  h  h  x = ihp ,

ih p = p  h  h  p = ihx ,

and thus the canonical variables indeed evolve classically:

x  x(t) = u  x  u 1
p  p(t) = u  p  u 1

 = x cos t + p sin t,
 = p cos t  x sin t.

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

this also checks against the explicitly evaluated -exponential for the sho 5), eith/h
cos(t/2) exp(2i tan(t/2)h/h).

(3.19)

(3.20)

consequently,

f (x, p; t) = z dadb f (a, b) eiax(t)eibp(t),

and hence the reverse convective ow (3.13) indeed obtains for the sho.

the result for the sho is the preservation of the functional form of the wigner

distribution function along classical phase-space trajectories:

f (x, p; t) = f (x cos t  p sin t, p cos t + x sin t; 0).

(3.21)

what this means is that any wigner distribution rotates uniformly on the phase
plane around the origin, essentially classically, even though it provides a complete
quantum mechanical description.

naturally, this rigid rotation in phase-space preserves areas, and thus illustrates
the uncertainty principle. by contrast, in general, in the conventional formulation
of quantum mechanics, this result is deprived of intuitive import, or, at the very
least, simplicity: upon integration in x (or p) to yield usual probability densities, the
rotation induces apparent complicated shape variations of the oscillating probability
density prole, such as wavepacket spreading (as evident in the shadow projections
on the x and p axes of the gure). only when (as is the case for coherent states 18))
a wigner function conguration has an additional axial x  p symmetry around
its own center, will it possess an invariant prole upon this rotation, and hence a
shape-invariant oscillating probability density. (in the gure, a rectangle is taken
to represent a generic conguration, and a small circle to represent such a coherent
state.)

the result (3.21), of course, is not new. it was clearly recognized by wigner 19).

it follows directly from (3.1) for (3.14) that

(t + px  xp) f (x, p; t) = 0 .

(3.22)

the characteristics of this partial dierential equation correspond to the above uni-
form rotation in phase space, so it is easily seen to be solved by (3.21). the result
was given explicitly in 6) and also 20), following dierent derivations. lesche 21), has
also reached this result in an elegant fth derivation, by noting that for quadratic
hamiltonians such as this one, the linear rotation of the dynamical variables (3.16)
leaves the symplectic quadratic form invariant, and thus the -product invariant.
that is, the gradients in the -product may also be taken to be with respect to the
time-evolved canonical variables (3.16), x and p ; hence, after inserting u  u 1
in
the -functional form of f , the -products may be taken to be with respect to x and
p , and the functional form of f is preserved, (3.13). this only holds for quadratic
hamiltonians, which thus generate linear canonical transformations.



diracs interaction representation may then be based on this property, for a
general hamiltonian consisting of a basic sho part, h0 = (p2 + x2)/2, supplemented
by an interaction part,

now, upon dening

h = h0 + hi .

it follows that moyals evolution equation reads,

in terms of the convective variables (3.16), x, p , hi (x, p) = hi(x, p ), and

then,

f (x, p ; t) = hi (x, p )  f (x, p ; t)  f (x, p ; t)  hi (x, p ).

in the uniformly rotating frame of the convective variables, the wf time-evolves
according to the interaction hamiltonianwhile, for vanishing interaction hamilto-
nian, f (x, p ; t) is constant and yields (3.21). below, in generalizing to eld theory,
this provides the basis of the interaction picture of perturbation theory, where the
canonical elds evolve classically as above ).

4. scalar field theory in phase space

to produce wigner functionals in scalar eld theory, one may start from the
standard, noncovariant, formulation of eld theory in hilbert space, in terms of
schrodinger wave-functionals.

for a free eld hamiltonian, the energy eigen-functionals are gaussian in form.
for instance, without loss of generality, in two dimensions (x is a spatial coordinate,
and t = 0 in all elds), the ground state functional is

boundary conditions are assumed such that the pm2  2

this is indeed the ground-state wigner energy--genfunctional. the -genvalue is
again the zero-point energy, which could have been removed by point-splitting the en-
ergy density, as indicated earlier. there does not seem to be a simple point-splitting

procedure that regularizes the star product as dened above and also preserves as-
sociativity.

as in the case of the sho discussed above, free-eld time-evolution for wigner
functionals is also eected by dirac delta functionals whose support lies on the
classical eld time evolution equations. fields evolve according to the equations,
(4.12)

 iht = h      h,

iht = h      h.

for h0, these equations are the classical evolution equations for free elds,

t (x, t) =  (x, t) ,

formally, the solutions are represented as

 (x, t) = cos(cid:18)tqm2  2
 (x, t) =  sin(cid:18)tqm2  2

t (x, t) = (cid:16)m2  2

consider the free-eld moyal evolution equation for a generic (not necessarily

energy--genfunctional) wf, corresponding to (3.22),

tw = z dx (cid:18) (x)



 (x)   (x)(cid:16)m2  2
x(cid:17)



 (x)(cid:19) w.

the solution is an innite-dimensional version of (3.13),

w [, ; t] = w [ (t) ,  (t) ; 0] .

(4.17)

(4.18)



adapting the method of characteristics for rst-order equations to a functional
context, one may simply check this solution again using the chain rule for functional
derivatives, and the eld equations evolved backwards in time as specied:
tw [, ; t] = tw [ (t) ,  (t) ; 0]
= z dx (cid:18)t (x,t)
= z dx(cid:18) ( (x,t))
= z dx(cid:18) ( (x,t))

the quantum wigner functional for free elds time-evolves along classical eld con-
gurations (which propagate noncovariantly according to (4.14,4.15)). in complete
analogy to the interaction representation for single particle quantum mechanics,
(3.26), the perturbative series in the interaction hamiltonian (written as a -function
of elds) is then dened in terms of the convective free eld variables ,  propa-
gating classically. specically,
