particularly, ref.  contains interesting discussion issues become apparent strongly coupled limit. known models based type string theory may rich structure lowenergy anomaly cancellation {$9506126$}. recently, considerable interest phenomenon  relation heterotic models {$9603142$}. purpose present paper investigate systematically lowenergy anomaly cancel- lation context e8 e8 heterotic string

models. approaches aimed nding consistent vedimensional mtheory models coupled fourdimensional gauge theories using constraints arising anomaly cancel- lation. clearly, models considerable phenomenological interest may lead potentially realistic n = 1 supergravity models four dimensions. finally, complement vedimensional approaches investigate closely phenomenological aspects, perform similar analysis directly fourdimensional eective actions associated e8 e8 heterotic string mtheory reduced s1 times calabiyau threefolds. is, analyze structure anomalous u (1) symmetries fourdimensional viewpoint. given considerable literature already existing anomalous u (1) symmetries heterotic theories, motivation present study? first all, interested new dimensional aspects problem

starting point assertion various u (1) quantum anomalies cancelled shift dilaton s. due universal coupling, one anomalous u (1) symmetry mixed gauge anomaly coecients gauge factor (and, fact, gravity,

hand, jn contains u (1) factors shall describe type i. dening property u (1) symmetry part internal bundle structure group. distinction two types u (1) symmetries new . however, frequently taken

addition, conclude type ii u (1) symmetries hn anomalyfree sense. remaining u (1) symmetries type jn may quantum anomalies cancelled anomaly inow. associated anomaly coecients hidden observable sector

implies that, sector, one type u (1) symmetry three types anomalies nonvanishing. addition, type u (1) symmetries vanishing mixed gauge anomaly nonvanishing gravitational cubic anomaly. stress statements apply independently two sectors. could, example, two anomalous u (1) symmetries, one sector, mixed gauge anomalies unrelated anomaly coecients. another example, could anomalous u (1)

vedimensional heterotic mtheory, also generalizations. notably, total size orbifold gauge groups gn restricted e8 mixed u (1) gauge anomaly also depend factor hn, is, nonuniversal. although generalizations realized coupling fourdimensional gauge theories special version vedimensional supergravity obtained mtheory, clear whether actually part mtheory. one may attempt realize models

consistent ones obtained vedimensional heterotic mtheory. also gain insight fourdimensional mechanism leads greenschwarz cancellation. standard gauge kinetic functions hn given fn = sit shift moduli rather dilaton leads anomaly cancellation. resolves puzzle raised above, since standard assumptions anomalous u (1) symmetries based cancellation induced dilaton shift. fact, 4 confusion precisely one type type ii u (1) symmetries. anomalous type ii (as well presumably type i) u (1) symmetries arise models originating so(32) heterotic theory calabi-yau threefold. cases, type ii anomaly cancellation works via shift dilaton and, hence, u (1) symmetry universal properties commonly assumed. however, models originating e8 e8 heterotic theory calabiyau threefold, seen type ii u (1) symmetries alway
