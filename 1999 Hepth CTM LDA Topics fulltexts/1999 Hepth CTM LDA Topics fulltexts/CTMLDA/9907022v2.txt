abstract

we derive an energy bound for a baryonic d5-brane probe in the ads5 
s5 background near the horizon of n d3-branes. congurations satu-
rating the bound are shown to be 1/4 supersymmetric s5-wrapped d5-
branes, with a total born-infeld charge n. previous results are recovered
as a special case. we derive a similar energy bound for a baryonic m5-
brane probe in the background of n m5-branes. congurations saturat-
ing the bound are again 1/4 supersymmetric and, in the ads7  s4 near-
horizon limit, provide a worldvolume realization of the baryon string
vertex of the (2,0)-supersymmetric six-dimensional conformal eld theory
on coincident m5-branes. for the full m5-background we nd a worldvol-
ume realization of the hanany-witten eect in m-theory.

1 introduction

many aspects of the physics of intersecting branes of m-theory or superstring theory
can be understood in terms of the worldvolume eld theory of a probe (or test)
brane in the supergravity background of other branes. one attractive feature of this
approach is that many such supergravity backgrounds have non-singular horizons near
which they are asymptotic to kaluza-klein vacua with an anti-de sitter (ads) factor
[1]; this allows one to make contact with the physics of supersymmetric conformal
eld theories (cft) via the ads/cft correspondence [2]. a nice example is provided
by a closed d5-brane surrounding n d3-branes (such that the d3-branes thread
the d5-branes). the hanany-witten (hw) eect [3] implies that each of the n
d3-branes must be connected to the d5-brane by a (fundamental) iib string. it
follows that the d5-brane cannot contract to a point but must instead contract to
some lowest energy conguration involving the d3-branes and n iib strings. in the
limit of large n this conguration can be investigated by replacing the d3-branes by
the corresponding supergravity background. as the d5-brane is allowed to contract
(quasi-statically) it enters the near-horizon region of the background for which the
geometry is ads5  s5. at this point the d5-brane is wrapped on the s5 factor and
the n strings emanating from it can be considering as having their endpoints on the
ads5 boundary. this conguration was interpreted in [5, 6] as a baryon-vertex of
n = 4 d = 4 super-yang-mills (sym) theory.
although the above description of the baryon vertex involves iib strings in addi-
tion to a d5-brane, it is also possible to view it as a single d5-brane carrying n units
of born-infeld (bi) charge [7, 8]. if one assumes that all the bi charge is concentrated
at one point, which may be taken to be a polar point, then one would expect the min-
imum energy conguration to be one that preserves the so(5) rotational invariance
about this point. such a conguration is determined by giving the radial position
of the d5-brane in ads5 as a function r() of the co-latitude angle  on s5. one
might also hope that this minimal energy conguration would preserve some fraction
of the d5-branes worldvolume supersymmetry. a condition on the function r() for
preservation of supersymmetry was found by imamura [7]. an explicit solution of
this condition, which was shown to preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, was then found by
callan et al [8]. it was subsequently shown that this solution saturates an energy
bound and hence minimises the energy for a xed value of a topological charge [9].

one might think that the restriction to so(5) invariant congurations is not
merely a convenience but rather a necessity, either for supersymmetry or for minimal
energy. since the equivalence of these two conditions may not be considered a priori
obvious we shall concentrate for the moment on the minimal energy condition. the
minimal energy conguration with a single pointlike singularity has been interpreted
as the common endpoint of n parallel strings [8]. for this interpretation to be valid it
must be possible, given sucient energy, to move the strings apart. in particular, it
must be possible to move their endpoints on the d5-brane to any point on the 5-sphere
such that r becomes a function of all ve angular coordinates of the 5-sphere with
n point singularities of unit charge. it is not guaranteed that a given conguration

1

of this sort will solve the d5-brane eld equations but every such conguration is
a possible initial conguration satisfying the basic requirement that the d5-brane
carries a total of n units of bi charge. as such it must relax to some minimal energy
conguration with the same boundary conditions at the n singular points. we shall
call these minimal energy congurations baryonic branes. the issue that we wish to
address here is whether the solution of [8] is the only baryonic d5-brane or whether
it is one of a class of minimal energy solutions.

we shall attack this problem on several fronts. first, we generalize the energy
bound of [9] to allow for arbitrary positions of the n singularities of the radial function
on the 5-sphere. the energy is shown to be bounded below by the total charge, whose
functional form is independent of the positions of the singularities. the conditions
under which this bound is saturated are then shown to be precisely those required
for preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry. this result generalizes the supersymmetry
condition of [7]. our method, which makes use of the -symmetry transformations of
the d5-brane [10], diers from that used in [7]. as for any super-brane action in any
background compatible with -symmetry, the -symmetry transformations involve
a matrix , characteristic of the background and type of brane. the number of
supersymmetries preserved by the combined background/brane system is the number
of linearly-independent solutions of [11]

 = 

(1.1)

where  is an arbitrary linear combination of killing spinors of the background1.

thus, we shall uncover no evidence from either supersymmetry or bogomolnyi-
type bounds that the so(5) invariant solution of [8] is the unique baryonic brane
conguration of either minimal energy or 1/4 supersymmetry. within the subclass of
d5-brane congurations specied by giving n pointlike singularities of unit charge at
specied points on s5 it is natural to suppose that the one of minimal energy saturates
the energy bound because there is no apparent obstacle that prevents this. we shall
derive an equation for the function r that is both necessary and sucient for both
saturation of the bound and 1/4 supersymmetry, so the issue of whether the bound
is saturated boils down to the existence or otherwise of solutions to this equation
subject to specied boundary conditions. for a single point singularity the equation
is solved by the so(5) invariant conguration of [8]. we have found a larger class
of solutions, of no particular symmetry, that depend on all ve angular coordinates
of s5, but the function r has branch cuts that make its interpretation dicult. we
have not found any solutions with isolated point singularities other than the so(5)
invariant one. this may be because they do not exist, but it could equally well be
because they are hard to nd. this remains an open question.

another purpose of this paper is to generalize these results for the baryonic d5-
brane to the baryonic m5-brane. to see what this entails, we recall that the hw
eect has an m-theory analogue [3, 4]. this eect implies that a closed m5-brane

1in all previous applications of this formula it has been found possible to replace  by a con-
strained but constant spinor , but this turns out not to be possible for the cases considered here.

2

with one direction parallel to n other m5-branes, and otherwise lying on a 4-sphere
at xed radius from them, must be connected to each of the enclosed m5-branes by
an m2-brane, with one dimension of the m2-brane in the common direction of all m5-
branes. let us replace the n m5-branes by a supergravity m5-brane and consider
the remaining one as a probe. near the horizon of the supergravity m5-brane the
geometry is that of ads7  s4 and if the probe is allowed to contract it will end up as
an m5-brane wrapped on the 4-sphere. this m5-brane is the baryon string vertex
of the (2,0) conformal eld theory on the ads7 boundary [6, 12]. it is connected to
the ads7 boundary by n m2-branes; from the ads7 perspective these n m2-branes
appear to meet in a string-like junction at some point in the ads7 interior.

here we will show that it is posible to view this conguration of m5-brane and
n m2-branes as a single m5-brane carrying n units of the charge associated with
the self-dual closed worldvolume 3-form. by analogy with the d5-brane case, we
will call this a baryonic m5-brane. a baryonic m5-brane wraps the 4-sphere of
ads7  s4 with singularities to take account of the non-zero charges. we derive an
energy bound satised by such congurations and show that the congurations that
saturate it preserve 1/4 of the bulk supersymmetry. we thereby nd an equation for a
function on s4 that is both necessary and sucient for either 1/4 supersymmetry and
minimal energy. the general solution of this equation will depend on all four angular
coordinates of s4. we have found explicit solutions of this type, although they again
involve branch cuts and do not have an obvious baryonic-brane interpretation, except
in the subcase of congurations that are invariant under the so(4) subgroup of the
so(5) isometry group of the 4-sphere. these are specied by a radial function of
a single angular coordinate. the requirement of 1/4 supersymmetry then reduces
to a dierential equation for this radial function which turns out to be the same as
one recently found, and solved, for a baryonic d4-brane in a d4-brane background
[13, 14].

we shall begin with an analysis of the baryonic d5-brane in the background of
n d3-branes and then carry out a similar analysis for the baryonic m5-brane in the
background of n m5-branes. the connection with baryon vertices involves a replace-
ment of these backgrounds by their near-horizon limits but our methods are general
and apply both to the full backgrounds and their near-horizon limits. the physics
of the full background case is, however, rather dierent as one cannot expect to nd
a static d5-brane wrapped around n d3-branes at an arbitrary distance from them.
one instead nds partially-wrapped congurations that provide a worldvolume real-
ization of the hw eect [8]. these results have since been extended to all dp-branes
[14]. because our analysis of supersymmetry applies to the full backgrounds we are
able to establish the partial supersymmetry of these d-brane congurations.

in the m5-brane case neither the near-horizon nor the full m5-brane background
has been previously considered. our results for the near-horizon case are as summa-
rized above. in the full background we again cannot expect to nd static s4-wrapped
solutions but we can, and do, nd partially-wrapped m5-branes that still preserve
1/4 supersymmetry. these results provide us with a detailed worldvolume description

of the hw eect in m-theory.

2 baryonic d5-brane

the d3-brane solution of iib supergravity has all elds vanishing except the dilaton,
which is constant, and the 10-metric and self-dual 5-form eld strength g(5). for n
coincident d3-branes at the origin, these take the form

ds2

(10) = u 1/2 ds2(e(1,3)) + u 1/2hdr2 + r2d2
5i
g(5) = 4r4h(5) + 5i

where d2
and 5 its hodge dual. the function u is

5 is the so(6)-invariant metric on the unit 5-sphere, 5 is its volume 5-form

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

r (cid:19)4
u = a +(cid:18)r

(cid:16)r4 = 4gsn()2(cid:17)

where gs is the string coupling constant and  the inverse iib string tension. we set
a = 1 for the full d3-brane solution and a = 0 for its near-horizon limit.

we now put a probe d5-brane of unit tension into this background such that
it wraps the 5-sphere. let  = (t, i) be the worldvolume coordinates, so that i
(i = 1, . . . , 5) are coordinates for the worldspace 5-sphere. the bosonic part of the
d5-brane action is

s = zrs5

d6(cid:20)q det (h + f )  v  g(5)(cid:21)

(2.4)

where h is the induced worldvolume metric and f = dv is the born-infeld u(1) eld
strength. because of the coupling of v to the background 5-form eld strength g(5),
the d5-brane must carry bi electric charge [5]. it follows that we cannot take f to
vanish but we can assume vanishing magnetic charge, in which case f0i are the only
non-zero components of f . following [7, 8, 9], we shall now proceed as if we were
seeking a worldvolume soliton on the d5-brane, represented by a (radial) deformation
of the d5-brane in the direction separating it from the backgound d3-branes. such
a conguration can be represented by the array

d3 : 1 2 3
d5 :
f 1 :

4 5 6 7 8

background

(2.5)

the 9-direction is the radial one.

in order to analyze this conguration we choose angular coordinates i (i =
1, . . . , 5) on the 5-sphere at radius r. we then x the worldvolume dieomorphisms
by choice of the static gauge

x 0 = t , i = i .

(2.6)

4

it now follows from the hamiltonian formulation of the super d-brane in a general
background [15] that the hamiltonian density for static congurations is given by

h2 = u  1

2 h ei ejgij + det gi

where g is the induced worldspace metric and ei is a covariantized electric eld
density related to f0i by

(det g) f0i = q det(h + f ) ejgij .

i ei = 4 r4qdet g

for the background/probe conguration considered here, and in the static gauge, the
gauss law constraint is

where gij is the so(6)-invariant metric on the unit 5-sphere. the source term, due
to the non-vanishing 5-form eld strength of the d3-brane background, conrms the
statement made above that the d5-brane carries a non-zero electric charge.

since we are considering only radial deformations of the d5-brane we may set

x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0 ,

(2.10)

which leaves the radial function r as the only active scalar. the worldvolume metric
for static congurations is now

2.1 energy bound

we now proceed to derive an energy bound for baryonic d5-branes. we shall do this,
following [16, 9], by expressing h2 as a sum of squares. this can be done in more than
one way and one gets a meaningful bound on the energy only if the quantity by which
h is bounded is independent of the quantities neglected in arriving at the bound. this

5

will be the case if h is bounded by the integrand of a topological charge, and this
requirement serves to resolve ambiguities. the result we obtain by this method will
be conrmed in the next subsection by an analysis of supersymmetry.

we begin by rewriting the energy density (2.7) as
h2 = r2 ei ej gij + ( eiir)2 + (ur4)2r2 det g + (ur4)2 det g gijirjr ,

(2.16)

this expression is manifestly so(6) invariant but minimal energy congurations can
be at most so(5) invariant. we shall later wish to exploit this fact, so we write the
5-sphere metric as

ds2 = d2 + sin2  d2
4

(2.17)

where d2
coordinates . we may now rewrite (2.16) as

4 is the so(5) invariant metric on the 4-sphere, which we take to have

h2 = 2

5(cid:16)r2 + (r)2 + grr(cid:17) +(cid:16) er(cid:17)2
+2 er er +(cid:16) er(cid:17)2

+ r2 e eg

+(cid:16) er(cid:17)2

(2.18)

where the primes indicate derivatives with respect to . note that g are the 
components of the inverse s5 metric gij.

we can further rewrite (2.18) as

h2 = z 2

5 +h5 (r cos )  eii (r sin )i2

+ |5gr  r e|2

(2.19)

where ||2 indicates contraction with g, and

z5 = 5 (r sin ) + eii (r cos ) .
5 where ~z5 has components
using the gauss law (2.9), one can show that z5 = iz i
r5
+ r r4!
5 = e r cos  +qdet g sin  a
z 
5
5 = e r cos  .
z

(2.21)

(2.20)

from (2.19), and the fact that z5 is a divergence, we deduce the bound

h  |z5| ,

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

gr (r sin )

with equality when

e = 5

e =

(r sin )  (r cos ) 

6

when combined with the gauss law (2.9), these conditions yield the equation

 5gij r

r ! + " 5

(r sin )  (r cos )  gijrr

sin 

r !# = 4r4qdet g

(2.25)

we shall analyse this equation in more detail later, after rederiving it as a condition
for preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry.

the rst-order equations (2.23) and (2.24) have been obtained for an arbitrary
value of the coecient a. as we are mostly interested in describing the baryonic
vertex in the near-horizon region of the background, we shall take a = 0 in the
remainder of this subsection (for an analysis of the a = 1 case see refs. [8, 14]). from
the bound (2.22) we deduce the bounds

h  z d5|z5|  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z d5z5(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(2.26)

on the total energy h. the rst inequality is saturated under the conditions just
obtained. the second inequality will be saturated too if z5 does not change sign
within the integration region. if the d5-brane is to describe a baryonic brane we must
take this region to be the 5-sphere with some number of singular points removed. for
the moment we shall simply assume that the second inequality is saturated when the
rst one is, in which case the total energy equals the 4-form dual of ~z5 integrated
over the 4-boundary of the d5-brane. in other words

h = lim

0xk zbk

d~s  ~z

(2.27)

where bk is a 4-ball of radius  with the kth singular point as its centre. the kth
term in the sum can be viewed as the energy of the iib string(s) attached to the kth
singular point. since we will not be able to provide an explicit solution of (2.25) with
these boundary conditions unless k = 1 we should stress that the right hand side of
(2.27) is still a lower bound on h even if the bound cannot be saturated.

to make contact with previous work we now specialize to so(5) invariant cong-

urations. in this case e = 0 and

e = qdet g(4) e()

(2.28)

where e is a function only of . similarly, r is now a function only of . it will also
be convenient to set

since  = r4 sin4  is also a function only of . for such so(5)-invariant congura-
tions the rst bps condition (2.23) is trivially satised while (2.24) reduces to

5 = qdet g(4) 

(2.29)

r
r

=

 sin  + e cos 
 cos   e sin 

.

(2.30)

7

this equation coincides with the bps equation found previously for so(5)-invariant
congurations [7, 8, 9]. for these congurations the gauss law (2.9) becomes the
ordinary rst order dierential equation

the solution of which is given by [8]

e = 4 r4 sin4  ,

e =

1
2

r4h 3 (  ) + 3 sin  cos  + 2 sin3  cos  i

(2.31)

(2.32)

where  is an integration constant. as pointed out in [8], the symmetry of the problem
allows us to restrict  to lie in the interval [0, 1].

we now return to consider whether the second inequality of (2.26) is saturated
when the rst one is. we shall restrict our discussion of this point to the so(5)-
invariant case, for which we can write

z5 = qdet g(4) z() .

(2.33)

where z is a function only of . using (2.30) we see that

z = r

( cos   e sin )2 + ( sin  + e cos )2

( cos   e sin )

,

(2.34)

the sign of which is determined by the sign of the denominator. it follows that z
will not change sign as long as it has no singularities within the integration region
  [0, ] (except, possibly, at the endpoints  = 0, ). now
r4 sin  ()

(2.35)

 cos   e sin  =

3
2

where

()      sin  cos  .

(2.36)
we see from (2.35) that the denominator of the expression (2.34) for z vanishes
at the endpoints  = 0,  but is otherwise positive provided that () is positive. for
  [0, 1] this condition is satised only for  = 0. in this case (2.32) becomes

e =

1
2

r4h3 (sin  cos   ) + 2 sin3  cos  i .

(2.37)

using this result for e() in (2.30) we nd a rst order equation for r() for which
the solution is [8]

1
3

r = r0(cid:18) 6
5(cid:19)

(cosec )(  sin  cos )

1

3 ,

(2.38)

where r0 is the value of r at  = 0.
it was shown in [8] that this conguration
corresponds to n fundamental strings attached to the d5-brane at the point  = ,

8

where r() diverges. one may verify that this is a solution of the second order
equation

" sin4 

r sin  + r cos #
r cos   r sin 

= 4 sin4  ,

(2.39)

found by combining (2.31) with (2.30).

the solutions of the rst-order equation (2.30) for  6= 0 have been obtained in [8].
in these solutions the range of values of  for which the solution makes sense does not
coincide with the interval [0, ] because the d5-brane does not wrap completely the 5-
sphere. in fact, when  6= 0 the d5-brane reaches the point r = 0, and can therefore
be interpreted as intersecting the d3-brane. because the d5-brane only partially
wraps the 5-sphere it captures only part of the ve-form ux. this is consistent with
the fact that the tensions of the d5-brane spikes of these partially-wrapped solutions
correspond to a number of strings less than n. in their study of baryonic multiquark
states with k < n quarks in n =4 d=4 super yang-mills theory, the authors of [17]
consider congurations in which k strings connect the d5-brane to r =  while the
remaining n  k strings connect it to r = 0.
it is tempting to think that these
congurations could be related to the  6= 0 solutions of the bps equation.

2.2 supersymmetry

we will now show that congurations saturating the bound (2.22) preserve 1/4 of
the bulk supersymmetry. our starting point is the equation (1.1). the matrix  is
given in [10] as a (nite) expansion in powers of the bi eld strength. because we
assume a purely electric eld strength, this expansion terminates at linear order and
the resulting matrix is

 =

1
6!

1

q det(h + f )

1...6 [1...61 + 15 f123...6(i2)] ,

(2.40)

where f0i are the only non-vanishing components of the born-infeld 2-form. the
matrices  are antisymmetrized products of the (reducible) induced worldvolume
gamma matrices

 = x mem

mm

(2.41)

where m are the constant d=10 dirac matrices and em
in the static gauge and for static congurations with x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = 0 we have

m is the spacetime vielbein.

0 = u  1/40
i = u 1/4 ri + u 1/4 irr .

here we have introduced the matrix

i = ei

(2.42)

(2.43)

where ei

i is the s5 funfbein. thus

the killing spinors of the d3-brane background take the form

(2.44)

(2.45)

where  is a covariantly constant spinor on e(1,3)  e6 subject to a 1/2 supersym-
metry breaking condition imposed by the background, which we discuss below. the
supersymmetry preservation condition (1.1) is thus reduced to

 =  .

(2.46)

although  is constant in cartesian coordinates on e(1,3)  e6, it is not constant in the
polar coordinates for e6 that we are using here. in polar coordinates a covariantly
constant spinor is independent of the radial variable and hence covariantly constant
on s5. covariantly constant spinors on sn were constructed explicitly in [18] for
a parameterisation in which the (diagonal) metric is found by iteration of ds2
n =
d2
n1. the result can expressed in terms of the n angles i = (, ) and
the antisymmetrixed products of pairs of the constant d=10 dirac matrices matrices
i = (, ). for n = 5 we have, with the understanding that 5  ,

which is the 1/2 supersymmetry breaking condition associated with the d3-brane
background. there are additional killing spinors in the near-horizon limit but the
corresponding background supersymmetries are not preserved by the baryonic d5-
brane probe and can therefore be ignored.

using the expression (2.40) for  we nd, after some simplication, that the

supersymmetry preservation condition (2.46) reduces to

u qdet [r2gij + irjr  f0if0j]  =
[ur5det g 01  ur3det g f0jirijr(i2)
+ ur4det g i(cid:16)f0i(i2) + ir0r1(cid:17) ] 

where i = gijj and

relations imply

0r 3  = h cos   sin  ri 
0  1  = h cos   sin  ri 

other useful conditions that also follow are:

i  (i2)  =  ri 
i  0r 1  = ri er 
 r (i2)  =  

(2.53)

(2.54)

using the relations (2.53), (2.54), one can rewrite the right hand side of (2.49) as

5(cid:20) (r sin ) + r ((r cos )  f0) + r (r cos   f0)
r (rf0  rf0 + rr sin )(cid:21) .

r (rf0  rf0) +

requiring the coecients of r and r in (2.55) to vanish, we obtain

f0i = i (r cos )

(2.55)

(2.56)

which can be interpreted as the bps equation for a worldvolume bion. it is straight-
forward to check that when (2.56) is satised the coecients of  and  vanish
identically, so (2.49) is satised as a consequence of (2.56) provided that

u qdet [r2gij + irjr  f0if0j] = 5(r sin ) .

(2.57)

it can be veried that this is identically satised when f0i is given by (2.56). we
have thus shown that (2.56) is sucient for preservation of 1/4 supersymmetry. we
believe that it is also necessary; certainly, it is not dicult to check that there is no
conguration preserving more than 1/4 supersymmetry.

we have now found the condition on r and f0i required for preservation of super-

symmetry. inserting (2.57) into (2.13) and contracting with gikkr we get

eiir =

5

(r sin ) gijirj(r cos )

(2.58)

which, when inserted back into (2.13), allows us to nd the following relation between
r and ei:

(r sin ) ei = 5gij" 1 +

one can check that (2.59) is equivalent to the two bps equations (2.23) and (2.24).
when combined with the gauss law these are equivalent to the second order equa-
tion (2.25). we conclude that congurations satisfying this equation preserve 1/4
supersymmetry.

2.3 multi-angle d5-brane solutions with 1/4 supersymmetry

we have just shown that any solution r(, ) to equation (2.25) preserves 1/4 super-
symmetry. we earlier discussed the so(5) invariant solution to this equation. we
recall here that it has the form [8]

r() = c

(())1/3

sin 

,

(2.62)

we shall now show that there exist many other, less-symmetric, solutions, in the near
horizon region. some may be found by considering uctuations about the so(5)-
invariant solution. this analysis suggests that a large class of solutions may be found
via an ansatze of the form

r(, ) = r()y

due to the functional form of our ansatz (2.63), the new solutions cannot represent
isolated singularities. in fact, the set of singularities in the radial function r(, )
is the union of the corresponding sets of singularities of the dierent product terms

2in fact, by requiring d

compatible with the separation of variables whose dependence on the polar angle rq, () is dierent
from the one in the so(5) invariant solution (2.62). we will not consider these solutions here.

since the function 1/ changes sign when  runs from 0 to , we conclude that it

congurations of the d5-brane.

(2.9) as a consequence of the dierential equations satised by the functions . to

the terms associated with new (-dependent) contributions are such that the new
solutions have a positively dened topological charge whenever the old (so(5)-
invariant) contribution is non-negative. this is the case, for the full range of , when
 = 0.

to summarize, we have found many new 1/4 supersymmetric congurations of
a d5-brane in the near-horizon geometry of a d3-brane background. none of these
new solutions has a straightforward interpretation as a baryonic brane because (i)
they have branch cut singularities rather than poles, and (ii) they only partially wrap
the 5-sphere. however, it seems clear that there must be a large class of other 1/4
supersymmetric solutions that are not captured by our ansatz. we have argued earlier
that these are likely to include solutions with multiple isolated point singularities, but
it appears to be dicult to nd explicit solutions of this type.

3 baryonic m5-brane

we start from the m5-brane solution of d=11 supergravity. the metric and 4-form
eld strength f(4) = dc (3) are

(cid:16)r3 =  nl3
p(cid:17) .

(3.3)

we will put a probe m5-brane in this background and look for solutions for which
the m5-brane wraps around the s4 factor. we shall start from the lorentz covariant
m5-brane action [19]; a useful review is [20] to which we refer for details of this
formalism and references to related work. we use the conventions of [21], with minor
modications. the action is constructed from the induced worldvolume metric h and
a 2-form worldvolume potential a with modied 3-form eld strength

h = da  c (3) .

(3.4)

here, c (3) should be understood as the pullback of the 3-form potential of the back-
ground; we will use the same symbol for a spacetime form and its pullback since it
will be clear which is meant from the context. thus, the bianchi identity for h can
be written as

dh = f(4) .

(3.5)

there is an additional eld in the lorentz covariant action, the pst scalar, but it
can be removed by a gauge transformation at the cost of breaking manifest lorentz
covariance.

let  = (t, i) be the m5-brane worldvolume coordinates, and dene the worldspace

tensor

h ij =

1

6det g

ijklm nhklm

where g is the induced worldspace metric. let

h = hihj h ij

(3.6)

(3.7)

this is not a worldvolume tensor but it is derived from a tensor by choice of the
temporal gauge for the pst eld. in the same gauge, and for unit m5-brane tension,
the m5-brane action is

s = z d6 (cid:26)q det(h + h) + v p hp 0(cid:27) +

1

4 z hc (6) + 2h  c (3) + h  hi

(3.8)

16

where

v p =

24

gp n ijklmhklm hijn

(3.9)

and c (6) is the (pullback of) the 6-form potential dual to c (3) (dened in backgrounds
that satisfy the d=11 supergravity eld equations).

notice that in the given background, the bianchi identity (3.5) becomes

dh = 3 r34 .

(3.10)

as in the d5-brane case we shall nd that this will require innite radial deformations
carrying m2-brane charge, analogous to the self-dual string solitons on the m5-brane
[22]. pursuing this analogy, we may think of the entire conguration as one involving
three branes, background, probe, and soliton, intersecting according to the array

m5 : 1 2 3 4 5
m5 :
m2 :

5 6 7 8 9

background

soliton.

(3.11)

the symbol  is read as ten. the tenth direction is the radial direction.

the probe m5-brane has bosonic worldvolume elds x 0, x a (a = 1, 2, 3, 4), x 5, r
and i where i (i = 1, . . . , 4) are now four angles parametrising s4, and a three-form
eld strength h. let i = (, i) be the worldspace coordinates with i parameter-
ising the 4-sphere. we shall choose the static gauge

x 0 = t

x 5 =  ,

i = i

(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) ,

(3.12)

appropriate to an m5-brane wrapped on a 4-sphere at a (variable) radius in the
5-space transverse to the background m5-brane. we also set

x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = x 4 = 0 .

(3.13)

in other words, we assume that r is the only active scalar. we also assume that
5r = 0, so that r is a function on the 4-sphere, with isolated singularities. for static
congurations we now have

h =

3.1 energy bound

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

we shall now derive an energy bound for baryonic m5-branes. it follows from the
hamiltonian formulation of the super m5-brane in a general background [21], that
the energy density h of a static conguration, in the background we consider and
subject to the restrictions discussed above, is such that

h2 = u  2

3 hdet g + ijgiji

(3.21)

where gij is given by (3.15). this expression is invariant under the so(5) isometry
group of the 4-sphere, but minimum energy congurations can be at most so(4)
invariant. we shall later wish to exploit this possibility so we write the 4-sphere
metric as

(3.22)
3 is the so(4)-invariant metric on the unit 3-sphere. let  ( = 1, 2, 3)

where d2
parametrize the 3-sphere, so that i = (, ). we may now rewrite (3.21) as

ds2 = d2 + sin2  d2

this can be further rewritten as

and ||2 indicates contraction with the  components of the four sphere metric gij, and

because h is, by assumption, independent of the worldspace coordinate  we may
interpret its integral over the remaining worldspace coordinates, parameterising s4,
as the tension t of a string with string coordinate . it then follows from the bound
(3.28) that

t  z d4 |z4|  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z d4z4(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(3.31)

the rst inequality is saturated by solutions of (3.32). the second inequality will be
saturated too provided that z4 does not change sign in the integration region. if this
is the case then the tension t can be expressed as a surface integral over a sum of n
3-spheres surrounding the n singular points on the 4-sphere. each such surface term
can be considered to be the energy/charge of an m2-brane attached to the 4-sphere
at that point.

by combining the bps conditions (3.29) and (3.30) with the bianchi identity
(3.19) we deduce that the energy density is minimised when the radial function r is
a solution of the second order equation

(3.32)

in the remainder of this subsection we shall restrict ourselves to the near-horizon
a = 0 geometry. to simplify the task of nding explicit solutions of equations (3.29)
and (3.30) in this case, we will restrict our attention to an so(4)-invariant ansatz for
which the radial function depends only on . in this case only the  component of
i is non-zero, and

 = qdet g(3) ()

19

(3.33)

where () is a function only of , and g(3) is the so(4)-invariant metric on the unit
3-sphere. the bianchi identity (3.10) now reduces to

this has the solution

 = 3 r3 sin3  .

() =  r3 hcos (cid:16)sin2  + 2(cid:17) + 2(2  1)i ,

where  is an integration constant which, as in the d5-brane case, can be restricted
to lie in the interval [0, 1].

it will be convenient to set

(3.34)

(3.35)

(3.36)

4 = qdet g(3) ()

since  = r3 sin3  is a function only of . for so(4)-invariant m5-brane congura-
tions the rst bps equation (3.29) is trivially satised while (3.30) reduces to

r
r

=

 sin    cos 
 cos  +  sin 

.

we may also set

z4 = qdet g(3) z

where z is now a function only of . using (3.37) we nd that
( sin    cos )2 + ( cos  +  sin )2

( cos  +  sin )

z = r

(3.37)

(3.38)

.

(3.39)

thus z has a denite sign provided that the denominator does not vanish. as

 cos  +  sin  = 2r3 sin  [cos   1 + 2] ,

(3.40)

the denominator of (3.39) has a denite sign for   [0, ] if  = 0. in this case the
solution of the rst-order dierential equation (3.37) can be easily shown to be:

r = r0 sec(/2)

(3.41)

where r0 is the value of r() at  = 0. this solution was previously found in [13]
in the context of a d4-brane probe in the d4-brane background geometry.
it is
straightforward to verify that the function given in (3.41) solves the second-order
ode obtained from (3.32) by setting a = 0 and restricting r to depend only on ,
namely:

" sin3 

r sin  + r cos #
r cos   r sin 

= 3 sin3  .

(3.42)

the function (3.41) represents an m5-brane wrapped on the s4 with a spike at the
point  = , where r() diverges. this spike extends along the axis  = . from our

20

previous results it is a simple exercise to compute the value of the tension t for the
conguration represented by (3.41). indeed, if we recall that z4 is a total derivative,
the integral of h over the four-sphere can be immediately evaluated. the energy per
unit surface of the spike obtained from this calculation is:

where v(3) = 22 is the volume of the unit three sphere, tm 5 is the tension of the
m5-brane which, up to now, was considered to be one and which is given by:

tm 5 v(3) |  (  )| ,

(3.43)

tm 5 =

1

(2)5 l6
p

,

(3.44)

and  (  ) can be extracted from (3.35) with  = 0. an elementary calculation shows
that

where

tm 5 v(3) |  (  )| = n tm 2 ,

tm 2 =

1

(2)2 l3
p

(3.45)

(3.46)

is the tension of the m2-brane. this clearly shows that the spike at  =  can be
interpreted as a bundle of n m2-branes emanating from the m5-brane. the relation
of our conguration of m5-branes and m2-branes with a conguration of d4-branes
and iia fundamental strings is easily understood if we reduce the array (3.11) along
the 5-direction.

as in the d5-brane case, we could have considered congurations with  6= 0.
the corresponding solutions of the bps equation can be extracted from those found
in [13] for the d4-brane in the near-horizon region of the d4-brane geometry. these
congurations of the m5-brane do not completely wrap the s4 and they extend into
the m5-brane throat region all the way to r = 0, in complete analogy with what
happens in the d5-brane case. similarly, one can evaluate the energy per unit surface
of the spikes of the  6= 0 solutions and show that their energy per unit surface
corresponds to a bundle of k m2-branes with k < n.

3.2 full m5 background

we are now going to study the embedding of the probe m5-brane in the full m5-brane
metric, which corresponds to taking a = 1 in the harmonic function u of equation
(3.3). we shall restrict ourselves to the analysis of the so(4)-invariant embeddings.
in this case, as was shown in [8], it is more convenient to work in a new set of variables
(z, ), related to (r, ) as follows:

z = r cos  ,

 = r sin  .

(3.47)

it is clear from (3.47) that z can take values in the interval (, +) whereas
0   < . in these new coordinates the m5-brane embedding is determined by a

21

function z(). by using the relation between the (z, ) and (r, ) coordinates, it is
not dicult to relate z() and its derivative to r() and r() = dr/d. after a short
calculation one gets:

dz
d

=

r sin   cos  r 
r cos  + sin  r  .

(3.48)

by using (3.48) one can convert the bps condition (3.30) into a rst-order dierential
equation for z(). to this end, we introduce the function

(, z) = 3 (cid:16) 1 +

r3

[ 2 + z2] 3

2 (cid:17)

it is easy to show that (3.30) is now equivalent to

dz
d

=

(cid:16) arctan (/z)(cid:17)

(, z)

,

(3.49)

(3.50)

where  is the same function as in equation (3.35) and its argument in (3.50) is
obtained after inverting the relation (3.47) between both coordinate systems.

the condition (3.50) can also be obtained by studying the energy of the m5-brane
in the new variables. let us dene, as in equation (3.31), the tension t as the energy
density integrated over the four worldspace coordinates i (i = 1,   , 4). it is not
dicult to change variables in this integral and express the result as the following
integral over :

t = v(3) z ds(

(3.51)

in this equation, and in what follows,  depends on  and z() as in (3.50). the
right-hand side of equation (3.51) contains a remarkably simple sum of squares. this
simplicity is a reection of how convenient are the new coordinates (z, ) for this
a = 1 case, as will be conrmed below. notice that the second term in (3.51)
vanishes precisely when the bps condition (3.50) holds. clearly, if we dene:

x

(3.52)

we obtain the following bounds:

t  v(3) z d| x |  v(3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z d x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(3.53)

obviously, the rst bound in (3.53) is saturated when the bps condition (3.50) holds.
we will show below that the second inequality is also saturated if equation (3.50) is
satised. moreover, it is easy to prove that x is a total derivative with respect to ,
namely:

r3

3

2 (cid:17) 4i .

(3.54)

x =

22

it is important to stress the fact that equation (3.54) follows from the explicit form
of  given in (3.35) and, thus, is valid for any function z(). actually, the derivative
of  with respect to  for an arbitrary function z() is given by:

d
d

=

3r33

d  z ) .

(3.55)

using (3.55) to evaluate the right-hand side of (3.54), one easily veries that the
result is the function dened in equation (3.52). moreover, the value of x when the
bps condition is satised is given by:

xbp s = h dz

d

+ (cid:16)dz

d(cid:17)1i  .

(3.56)

as   0, the sign of dz/d for any z() satisfying (3.50) is the same as the sign of
. therefore, it follows that
(3.57)

xbp s  0

which implies, as was previously claimed, that the second inequality in (3.53) is
saturated if the rst one is saturated.

the bps equation (3.50) is the same as the one appearing in the study of a d4-
brane probe in the full d4-brane geometry. its analytical solution was found in [14].
it turns out that z() can be represented implicitly by the equation

z = z +

r3

2 h

z

2 + z2

+ 1  2 i

(3.58)

where z is a constant of integration. it can be veried that this function satises
the second-order dierential equation (3.32), as required to minimise the energy.

the behaviour of the solution (3.58) has been analyzed in detail in [14]. it was
found there that, for regions close to the horizon, the embedding represented by
the function z() coincides with the solutions found for a = 0. however, for the
asymptotic region   , the behaviour of both types of solutions is completely
dierent. indeed, it follows from (3.49) and (3.50) that for    and z xed (which
corresponds to   /2), dz/d decreases as 3, which implies that z constant
as   , i.e. the asymptotic shape of the brane is just a plane. this constant
asymptotic value of z is precisely the integration constant z, as can be veried
directly from (3.58). notice that this is very natural from the physical point of
view since our metric is asymptotically at and one expects the minimal energy
conguration of a tensile object in a at metric to be such that the object is not bent
at all.

under certain conditions our solution (3.58) contains a tubular region which
has one of its ends near the horizon and can locally be described by the equation
 =constant. since |dz/d| is then large, these portions of the brane are not located
in the asymptotic region    in which, as we argued above, dz/d  0. these
tubes therefore spread out and approach the plane z = z as one moves away from

23

the near-horizon region. detailed study [14] shows that for large |z| the transition
between these two regimes is very fast. notice that these spikes, which have innite
length in the near-horizon approximation, have actually a nite length (of the order
of |z|) in the full geometry. in this sense one can say that the full metric regularizes
the singularities of the near-horizon description. moreover, it can be veried that
the energy of the tubes per unit surface equals that expected for a bundle of m2-
branes. from this analysis we get a picture of the hw eect in m-theory in which
m5-branes are connected by m2-branes which, from the worldvolume point of view,
can be regarded as wormholes connecting the test m5 brane to the horizon of the
metric created by the background m5-branes.

3.3 supersymmetry

we will now show that congurations saturating the bound (3.28) preserve 1/4 of the
bulk supersymmetry. our starting point is again (1.1). the explicit form of  for
the m5-brane can be found in [20]. omitting some terms which are manifestly zero
for the congurations we consider, and passing to the temporal gauge for the pst
scalar, we have

q det(h + h)  =

1
2

 det h 0 ij h ij 

1
5!

u 1/60i1...i5i1...i5 .

(3.59)

again ij  are antisymmetrized products of the (reducible) worldvolume gamma
matrices i = ix mem
mm, where m are the constant d=11 dirac matrices and
m is the spacetime elfbein. in the static gauge and for static congurations with
em
x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = x 4 = 0 we have

0 = u  1/30
i = u 1/3 ri + u 1/3ir .

in this expression we have introduced the matrix

where ei

i is the s4 vierbein. thus

i = ei

ii

{i, j} = 2gij .

for the m5-brane background, the killing spinors take the form

 = u  1

12 

(3.60)

(3.61)

(3.62)

(3.63)

where  is covariantly constant on e(1,5) e5 subject to a 1/2 supersymmetry breaking
condition imposed by the background, which we discuss below. the condition for
preservation of supersymmetry (1.1) is thus reduced to

 =  .

24

(3.64)

in polar coordinates for e5, with 4  , we have

 = e

3

y=1

e

,

where 0 is a constant spinor satisfying

67890 = 0 .

(3.65)

(3.66)

there are again additional killing spinors in the near-horizon limit (a = 0) but these
play no role in our analysis for the same reason as in the d5-brane case.

the supersymmetry condition (3.64) gives

u 1/3qdet (gij + kikj) = h4r0  iir05
i(cid:16)ir05 + u r3 det g gijjr0(cid:17)i

where

and

to solve this equation we will impose the conditions

00 = 0 ,

050 = 0 .

(3.67)

(3.68)

(3.69)

(3.70)

which are the conditions expected for an m5-brane with an m2-brane ending on it.
one can then deduce the following identities :

0 = (cos    sin )
05 = (cos    sin ) .

the matrix multiplying  on the right hand side of (3.67) can be written as

4 (r sin )  ii (r cos ) + h4 (r cos ) + ii (r sin )i
+(cid:16)4gr cos  + r cos (cid:17) + (cid:16)4gr sin  + r sin (cid:17)

requiring the coecient of  to vanish, we nd that

 = 4

gr

requiring the coecient of  to vanish and using (3.74) we then nd that

(r sin ) = 4"(r cos )

(3.73)

(3.74)

(3.75)

notice that (3.74) and (3.75) are entirely equivalent to the equations saturating the
energy bound (3.29) and (3.30). it is straightforward to check that when (3.74) is sat-
ised, the coecient of  vanishes identically, so (3.73) is satised as a consequence
of (3.74) and (3.75) provided that

u 1/3qdet (gij + kikj) =

4 r2

(r sin )  1 +

gijirjr

since

one can use (3.68) to rewrite the left hand side of (3.76) as

det (gij + kikj) = (det g)(cid:16)1 + gijkikj(cid:17)

u 1/3 det g + u 1/3(cid:20)r2ij gij +(cid:16)iir(cid:17)2(cid:21)

(3.76)

(3.77)

(3.78)

which can be shown to satisfy (3.76) when (3.74) and (3.75) are satised. we have
thus shown that equations (3.74) and (3.75) are sucient for preservation of 1/4
supersymmetry. as we saw earlier, when these equations are combined with the
bianchi identity they become equivalent to the second order equation (3.32). any
solution of this equation is therefore 1/4 supersymmetric.

3.4 multi-angle m5 solutions with 1/4 supersymmetry

we shall proceed as in subsection 2.3 to nd more general solutions to equation (3.32)
in the near horizon region. our starting point will be the so(4) invariant solution
for  6= 0, which is [13, 14] :

r() = c

(())1/2

sin 

where () = 2(1  2  cos ). this function satises the following identity:

d

d   r sin2 

(r sin )! = 2 sin  ,

using the separation of variables ansatz

r(, ) = r()y

() ,

we nd that (3.32) reduces to

the singularity structure of the new m5-brane solutions is similar to what we found

it can be veried that the s satisfy (3.19). it is again remarkable that the new
contributions to the topological charge  are positive whenever the so(4) invariant
conguration is positive (for the full range of  when  = 0).

4 discussion

a universal feature of supersymmetric p-branes is the appearance in the action gov-
erning their dynamics of a wess-zumino (wz) term. in the simplest cases this term
just describes the coupling of the brane to a (p+1)-form potential of the supergrav-
ity background, and the physics associated with this coupling has been extensively
investigated in the past. for both d-branes and the m5-brane this coupling is only
the rst term in an expansion of the wz term in powers of the eld strength of a
worldvolume gauge eld. in certain backgrounds the rst non-leading term in this
expansion provides a source term for the worldvolume gauge eld which, as a con-
sequence, cannot vanish. the baryonic brane congurations discussed here, and in
previous work, provide examples of the physics associated with this phenomenon. in
previous work a 1/4 supersymmetric baryonic d5-brane with so(5) symmetry was
found and shown to saturate an energy bound, and similar results have been estab-
lished for other d-branes. one result of this paper is an extension of these results to
the m5-brane. in this case the baryonic brane provides a worldvolume realization of
the baryon string-vertex of the (2, 0) superconformal eld theory which, according to
the ads/cft correspondence, lives on the boundary of the ads4  s7 near-horizon
background of the supergravity m5-brane.
another purpose of this paper has been to nd the general conditions implied
either by saturation of a bogomolnyi-type energy bound or by 1/4 supersymmetry,
for both baryonic d5-branes and baryonic m5-branes. we have found these condi-
tions, and we have found that they coincide, i.e. congurations saturating the bound
are 1/4 supersymmetric and vice-versa. at least, this is formally true in that both
conditions yield the same second-order partial dierential equation for a function r
on s5 (in the d5-brane case) or s4 (in the m5-brane case). of course, the equations
for the two cases, d5 and m5 are dierent, but they are broadly similar. particular
solutions are easily found in the d5-brane case via an so(5)-invariant ansatz. the
condition for 1/4 supersymmetry then reduces to one found previously, and the pre-
ciously found baryonic brane solution is recovered. we have shown how a similar
so(4)-invariant ansatz yields an explicit baryonic m5-brane solution.

in going beyond these simple solutions of high symmetry one runs into the di-
culty that a given local solution of the 1/4 supersymmetry condition will not generally

28

be well dened on the 5-sphere (4-sphere in the m5 case, but we concentrate on the
d5 case in the following discussion). of course, no solution can really be well-dened
on the 5-sphere because the d5-brane carries a non-zero charge but, for reasons that
we have explained in the introduction, one might suppose that the singularities could
be conned to points, which could then be interpreted as the endpoints of n strings.
the so(5)-invariant solution has a single point singularity which has been inter-
preted as the coincident endpoints of n parallel strings. however, although we have
found many new 1/4 supersymmetric solutions, none of them has singularities of this
type; in fact they have branch cuts. we suspect that this is due to the restricted
nature of the ansatz that we have used to nd these solutions. the full equation for
1/4 supersymmetry is not at all simple and one cannot expect to nd all its solutions
explicitly. thus, our inability to nd solutions with specied singularities is in no
way an indication that they do not exist, although it is also true that we cannot prove
that they do. the point is an important one because it has implications for potential
limitations of the worldvolume approach to spacetime physics, but its full resolution
must await future studies.
