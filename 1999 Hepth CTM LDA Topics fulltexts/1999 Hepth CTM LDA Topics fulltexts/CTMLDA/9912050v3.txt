abstract

we describe scalar and spinor elds on a noncommutative sphere

starting from canonical realizations of the enveloping algebra a =
u(u(2)). the gauge extension of a free spinor model, the schwinger
model on a noncommutative sphere, is dened and the model is quan-

tized. the noncommutative version of the model contains only a nite

number of dynamical modes and is non-perturbatively uv-regular. an

exact expression for the chiral anomaly is found. in the commutative

limit the standard formula is recovered.

1 introduction

the basic notions of the noncommutative geometry were developed in [1]-[3],

in the form of the matrix geometry they apeared in [4], [5]. the essence of this

approach consists in reformulating rst the geometry in terms of commutative

algebras and modules of smooth functions, and then generalizing them to

their noncommutative analogs. the notion of the space, the continuum of

points, is lost, and this is expected to lead to an uv-regular quantum eld

theory.

one of the simplest models for a noncommutative manifold is the non-

commutative (fuzzy) sphere, see [6]-[9]. simple eld theoretical models con-

taining scalar and spinor elds on a fuzzy sphere are described in [10]-[13],

an alternative form of the dirac operator was proposed in [14]-[15]. the

issue of gauge eld was investigated in [16]. a systematic approach to other

structures on a fuzzy sphere, like monopoles and instantons, was proposed

recently in [17]-[19]. all models in question posses only nite number of

modes and are uv-regular.

our aim is to apply the ideas of a noncommutative geometry to the

schwinger model (qed in 2d) on a fuzzy sphere. the commutative ver-

sion was analyzed in detail in [20]. its noncommutative matrix version was

proposed in [21]. in [22] a supersymmetric schwinger model was described

possessing nite number of modes. in [23] we proposed an approach going

beyond matrix models. here we extend these investigations.

the construction of fuzzy eld-theoretical models consists in two steps:

1) fuzzy kinematics: we describe rst scalar and spinor elds on a non-

1

commutative (fuzzy) shere starting from a canonical realization of the en-
veloping algebra a = u(u(2)), working within the set of all nite dimensional
fuzzy realizations of elds. using a noncommutative version of a prepoten-

tial formalis we perform straightforwardly the gauge extension of the model
- the schwinger model. it contains fuzzy elds: the spinor elds , , the

dynamical gauge eld  and a fuzzy gauge eld  corresponding to the pure

gauge. to gaurantee the local gauge symmetry the eld  should be assumed

within all its fuzzy realizations.

2) fuzzy dynamics: we dene the gauge invariant fuzzy schwinger model
action depending on a nite number of modes of dynamical elds ,  and

. we quantize the schwinger model within functional integral formalism

integrating over dynamical modes. the truncation of modes cannot by per-

formed for the the pure gauge eld , however the mean values of gauge

invariant functionals are -independent: the intengration over nite number

of dynamical modes gives the same result for any xed . this guarantees

the nonperturbative uv-regularity of the model and allows us to calculate
excatly the noncommutative chiral anomaly. using an explicit -product
formula on a sphere we recover in the commutative limit the standard result.

in section 2 we describe the fuzzy kinematics of the schwinger model.

in section 3 we formulate its quantum fuzzy dynamics and calculate exactly

fuzzy chiral anomaly. last section 4 contains concluding remarks.

2.1 the scalar eld

we describe the scalar eld on a sphere s2 in the su(2)-invariant formula-

tion, see [20]. the sphere is interpreted as the hopf bration

s3 = {  c2; + = }  s2 = {x = (x1, x2, x3)  r3}

with xi = 1
2+i, i = 1, 2, 3. in this approach the elds are functions of
complex variables , ,  = 1, 2. the space hk of elds with a topological
winding number 2k  z is dened as the space of analytical functions

 = x amnmn , |n|  |m| = 2k .

(1)

if n = (n1, n2) then n = n1n2, |n| =
we use the multi-index notation:
n1 + n2, n! = n1!n2!, etc. obviously, it holds hk = hk and hkhl  hk+l.
the space h0 of functions constant on a ber can be identied with algebra
of functions on s2. all spaces hk are h0-modules. on hk we introduce the
scalar product

(1, 2) = z d12 , d = (2)1d3x(x2

i  2) .

(2)

the poisson structure on c2 is dened by elementary brackets

{, } = {, } = 0 , {, } = i , ,  = 1, 2 .

(3)

a poisson bracket realizations of the u(2) algebra is then obtained by choos-

ing the basis:

xi =

1
2

+i i = 1, 2, 3 , r = + .

(4)

3

the functions xi generate su(2), and r is a central element extending it to
the u(2) algebra. in hk the u(2) algebra is realized as the adjoint poisson
algebra:

xi = i{xi, } , i = 1, 2, 3 , r = i{r, } .

(5)

this allows to construct wigner d-functions in a standard way: (i) the lowest

weight is given by

dj
k,j = [(2j + 1)!/(j + k)!(j  k)!]1/2rjj+k

above. we replace the commuting complex parameters , , by annihila-
tion and creation operators ,  satisfying commutation relations

(8)

they act in the auxiliary fock space f = {|ni = 1n!

n|0i, n = (n1, n2)}.

the space hk of elds with topological winding number 2k is formed by

operators of the form

 = x amn m n , |n|  |m| = 2k ,

(9)

dened on the invariant domain ff = {p n|ni - nite sum}.
it holds
hk = hk and hk hl  hk+l. the space h0 itself is a faithful canonical
realization of the enveloping algebra a = u(u(2)) generated by

xi =

1

+i  ,

i = 1, 2, 3 , r = +  .

(10)

the subspace fn = {|ni  f ,|n| = n} is a carrier space of the unitary
irreducible su(2) representation corresponding to the spin s = n
2 . the u(2)
action is realized in hk as the adjoint commutator action

xi  = i[xi, ] , i = 1, 2, 3 , r  = i[r, ] .

(11)

the fuzzy analogs of the wigner d-functions can be constructed analogously

as in the commutative case: (i) the lowest weight is

dj
k,j = [(2j + 1)!/(j + k)!(j  k)!]1/2 j+k

the factor nj(r) = [(r + j + 1)r!/(r + 2j + 1)!]1/2 is diagonal, it guarantees
that the restricted d-functions djj

|k|,|k| + 1, . . . , j, form an orthonormal basis in the space of linear mappings

they are square roots of rational functions in j, they break the commutativ-

ity (in general, they are not symmetrical with respect to primed and double
primed indices), and they restrict the summation to |k|  j  min(j +j, j).

(24)

j = j + k, j = j  k, provided that j  j + j. consequently, algebraic
relations among fuzzy polynomials are, up to o(j1) corrections, the same as
their commutative analogs. for example, for polynomial operators   hk,
a, b  h0, the relation m n  am m n bn reduces in the commutative
limit (j = 1
2(m  n)-xed) to the commutative re-
lation   ab (this can be extended to the case when wigner expansion
coecients of all operators in question are rapidly decreasing). this is just

2 (m + n)  , k = 1

the correspondence principle on a sphere [6] (in more general context see

[24], [25]). however, for a more complex objects, like the determinant (26),

the o(j1) corrections can accumulate, and an anomaly can apear in the

commutative limit.

2.2 the spinor eld

spinor elds in the standard (commutative) su(2)-invariant formalism are

2-component functions




= f + + g , + =

(29)

 =

2

with 1 = 1(, ), 2 = 2(, ), f = f (, ) and g = g(, ) being
functions in complex variables , ,  = 1, 2. the space sk of spinor
elds with winding number 2k  z is formed by elds with 1, 2  hk, or
equivalently, with f  hk+1/2 and g  hk1/2.

in order to dene the dirac operator we introduce an orthonormal frame

on s2 = {~x  r3; ~x2 = 2} as follows:

~y0 = 1~x = 1~ , ~y+ = ~y


= 1~ .

(30)

9

here ~y0 is an unit vector perpendicular to s2, and ~y are complex normalized
vectors tangential to s2, ( - antisymmetric, 12 = 1). the projections of

the spin angular momentum 1

2~ are

1
2

 =

1
2

~y.~ ,

1
2

0 =

1
2

~y0.~ .

the cliord algebra relations are satised: 2
 = 0, + + + = 1,
+  + = 20. similarly, the projection of the orbital angular mo-
memum ~x (the su(2) right-invariant vector elds dened in (5)) are given

as

here,

r = ~y. ~x  k , r0 = ~y0. ~x  k0 .

k+ =  , k = 



, k0 =

1
2

(

  ) ,

(31)

are the su(2) left-invariant vector elds. the free dirac operator is given as

d0  i+ + i+ = k+ + k+ + 1 ,

(32)

where,

i = k +

1
2

 , i0 = k0 +

1
2

0 ,

are projectionts of the total angular momenum ~j = ~x + 1
2

~ into basis (30).

the dirac operator d0 anticommutes with the chirality operator 0. since
0 = , f and g are chiral components of  to the chiralities +1
and -1 respectively. the operator d0 already contains the 2k-monopole eld

strenght f0. this can be identied with the term in d2

0.

it can be found straightforwardly: f0 = 1

0 proportional to
2[r+, r]0 = k00. the

10

operator r0 = k0 takes in sk constant value k. obviously, f0|sk = k0 is
the monopole eld in question.

standard formulas are obtained by replacing in the formulas above ,
 by arbitrary s3  s2 sections (~x), (~x). below we shall use an
equivalent su(2)-invariant supersymmetric picture which is appropiate for

the noncommutative generalization (see [12] - [13]).

in this formalism the elds are functions on c2|1 in complex variables ,
,  = 1, 2, and one anticommuting (grassmannian) pair a, a. the space

of spinor elds with given winding number 2k is dened as

sk = hk+ 1

2

a  hk 1

2

a = { = f a + ga; f  hk+ 1

2

, g  hk 1

2} .

in this approach the analogs of the spin angular momentum projections are

1

0 =

the cliord algebra relations are satised. the operators p+ = aa and
p = aa are projection onto spinor subspaces with chiralities +1 and 1
respectively. similarly, the analogs of the total angular momentum projec-

tions are

i = k , i0 = k0 ,

so the analogs of the orbital angular momentum projections are given as

r = k 

1
2

 , i0 = k0

in sk the free dirac operator is given by the formula (see (32)):

d0  i+ + i+ = k+ + k+ .

(33)

11

it anticommutes with the chirality operator 0 = p+  p. the monopole
eld is: f0 = 1

2[r+, r]0 = k00  1
2.

the charge conjugation j is dened as follows: j (f a+ga) = gafa.
obviously, j : sk  sk, and j 2 = 1. the inner product in sk we dene
as

(1, 2) = z dj 12 = z d(f1 f2 + g1g2) ,

(34)

where d = (162)1d2d2dada( + aa ). any spinor eld from
sk can be expanded as

in the space of functions on c2|1 a graded poisson structure can be in-

troduced by postulating elementary graded brackets

{, } = i , {a, a} = i ,

(36)

(all other elementary brackets vanish). the operators k and  can be
expressed in terms of poisson brackets as follows

k = i{, .} , k+ = i{, .} ,

 = ia{a, .} , + = ia{a, .} .

(37)

note 1: the u(2|1) poisson bracket superalgebra is realized by choosing

the basis

xi =

1
2

+i , i = 1, 2, 3 , b = + + 2aa ,

12

v = a , v = a ,  = 1, 2 , s = + + aa .

(38)

the operators xi and b are even generators, and v, v the odd ones of the
superalgebra su(2|1); s is a central element extending it to the u(2|1) superal-
gebra. the adjoint poisson bracket representation of the u(2|1) superalgebra
is realized in the space of superelds:

xi = i{xi, } , b = i{b, } , s = i{s, }

v = {v, } , v = {v, } .

(39)

this action can be extended to the enveloping superalgebra b = u(u(2|1)) =
b0  b1. the spinor space sk is invariant with respect to the adjoint action
(39) generated by the even subalgebra b0. the free dirac operator can be
expressed as: d0 = 1

2(vv + v v).

in the fuzzy case we quantize the graded poisson structure (36): we

replace the graded commuting variables ,  and a, a by annihilation and
creation operators ,  (bosonic) and a, a (fermionic) satisfying graded

commutation relations

[ , ] =  , [a, a] = 1

(40)

(all other elementary brackets vanish). they act in the auxiliary fock super-
space sf = {|ni = (n!)1/2 na|0i = f  af . the subspace of spinor
operators with winding number 2k we dene as the space

sk = hk+ 1

of odd mappings sf  sf dened on the invariant domain sff = ff ff a
(of nite linear combinations of states |n, i). the charge conjugation j is

13

dened as follows: j f a + ga = ga  fa. obviously, j : sk  sk, and
j 2 = 1.

the space sk is a bi-module with respect to the left and right multipli-
cations by the elements of the algebra b0 = h0  aa h0. any element from
sk can be expanded as

by sk = hk+ 1

a we denote the subspace of sk with ajkm(r) =
ajkm + o(r1). the space sk is a b0 = h0  aa h0 bi-module. in sk the free
dirac operator is dened as follows (see (33)):

2

d0 = k+  + k+  ,

(42)

where

k =  [ , .] , k+ =  [ , .] ,

 = a[a, .] , + = a[a, .] .

(43)
it anticommutes with the chirality operator 0 = p+ p. here p+ = a[a, .]
and p = a[a, .] are projectors onto subspaces with chiralities +1 and 1,
respectively.

note 2: the fuzzy analogos xi, v, v and s of generators satisfying in
sf the u(2|1) graded commutator relations are given by eqs. (38), similarly
the u(2|1) adjoint action and the dirac operator are given by eqs. (39) and
(42) (of course, all commuting parameters are replaced by annihilation and
creation operators and graded brackets i{., .} by graded commutators [., .]).
the subspace sfn = fn fn1a is the carier space of the atypical unitary
irreducible representation of su(2|1) superalgebra.

in sj

case (see [12]).

2.3 the gauge eld

in the commutative case it is convenient to introduce gauge elds within

the prepotentential formalism. in this approach the full dirac operator d is

given by the formula:

d = d0 + a , a = a+ + a+ .

(48)

15

the chiral components a = k(i) of the gauge potential are expressed
in terms of two real prepotentials   h0 and   h0: the -dependent term
i[d0, ] of a represents a pure gauge eld (corresponding to an exact 1-form

in the dierential form approach), whereas the -dependent term [d0, ]

represents a dynamical gauge eld (corresponding a co-exact 1-form). we

note that d0 already contains the monopole gauge eld (corresponding to a

harmonic 1-form).

in the su(2)-invariant formalism the full dirac operator can be written

in the form

d = i+ + i+ = r+ + r+ + 1 .

(49)

where i+ = i+1, i = 1i+, analogously r+ = r+1, r =
1r+. here,  = eie is an invertible element from h0 acting on  as
a left multiplicator. the eld strenght f can be identied with the term in

d2 proportional to 0:

f =

1
2

[r+,r]0 = (

1
2

[r+,r]  r0)0 + r00 .

(50)

it can be shown straightforwardly that 1

2[r+,r]  r0 = , where  is

the laplace operator on a sphere.

using the relations i = k and r = k  1

2 valid in the su(2)-
invariant supersymmetric formalis, the expressions for the full dirac operator

and the eld strenght read

and

d = k+ + k+ ,

f = (

1
2

[k+,k]  k0)0 + r00 ,

16

(51)

(52)

with

k+ = k+1 , k = 1k+ .

(53)

any unitary element   h0 generates a local u(1) gauge transformations
of all elds in question. the spinor eld  = f a + ga  sk, the conjugated
spinor eld  = fa + ga  sk and the gauge eld   h0 transforms as
follows:

   ,    ,    .

(54)

obviously, ei  ei and e is gauge invariant. moreover, it can be easily
seen that under gauge transformations: d  d, f  f  = f . con-
sequently, the spinor term id  h0 in the schwinger model lagrangian
and the gauge eld term f 2  sh0 are both gauge invarant.

in the fuzzy supersymmetric picture we use exactly the same formulas as

above, however all objects (variables, elds and spaces) should be replaced

by their noncommutative partners. the full dirac operator is an operator
the noncommutative spinor space sk dened as

d = k+  + k+  ,

where

k+ =  k+ 1 , k = 1 k+  .

(55)

(56)

the operators k: have been dened in section 2,  is an arbitrary invertible
element from h0. the eld strenght operator f : sk  sk we dene in
analogy with (52) as follows:

f = (

1
2

[ k+, k]  k0)0 + r00 ,

(57)

17

the local gauge transformations of all elds in question, the spinor eld

  sk, the conjugated spinor eld   sk and the gauge eld   h0
are generated by unitary elements   h0. the gauge transformations rules
read:

    ,    ,     .

(58)

thus, the right-radial operator e in the polar decomposition of  = eie is

gauge invariant. moreover, it can be easily seen that under gauge transforma-
tions: d  d , f   f . consequently, the fuzzy analog of the spinor
term id  h0 in the schwinger model lagrangian is gauge invariant,
whereas the gauge term f 2  s h0 transforms homogenously: f 2   f 2 .

3 quantization and chiral anomaly

3.1 field action and quantization

in the commutative case the schwinger model eld action

s[, , ] =

1
4q2

o z df 2 + z d d ,

(59)

is gauge invariant (qo is interaction constant). introducing new spinor elds

by putting

  0 =  := f a + 1ga ,
  0 =   := f 1a + ga .

we obtain an action

s[0, 0, ] =

1
4q2

o z df 2 + z d 0d00 ,

18

(60)

(61)

from which the electromagnetic interaction is eliminated, it describes a sys-

tem of non-interacting gauge and spinor elds. we stress, that this is a valid

procedure for the classical (non-quantized) elds only.

we quantize the schwinger model within the functional integral approach.

the dynamical elds in question  = {, , } we expand as follows:
k+1/2,ma]  sk ,

k1/2,ma + ajkmdj

kmdj

 =

[aj+



xj=|k|1/2 x|m|j

 =



xj=|k|1/2 x|m|j

[aj+
kmdj

k1/2,ma + aj

kmdj

k+1/2,ma]  sk ,

 =



xj=1 x|m|j

mdj
bj

0m  h0 , bj

m = (1)mbjm .

(62)

the pure gauge prepotential  is an arbitrary xed real fuction from h0.
the action s[], given in (59), is a function of grassmannian parameters
ajkm, aj

km and of complex parameters bj
m.

the quantum mean values of gauge invariant eld functionals p [] are

dened by the formula

hp []i = z1 z (d)k p [] es[] , z = z (d)k es[] .

(63)

they do not depend on the choice of . the symbol (d)k denotes the formal

innite dimensional integration over all dynamical eld congurations:



(d)k  
yj=1


km

ym=1

m

yj=|k|+1/2 y|m|j



da0

 y|m||k|1/2

19

daj

kmdaj

km


(64)

(here a0

km and a0

km correspond to zero modes). the mean values are dened

only formally, and a regularization procedure is needed.

we may try to solve the model by performing the same spinor elds trans-

formation (60). however, in the quantum case we have to take into account

the determinat of this transformation (which is inverse to the corresponding

jacobian appearing in the functional integral). formally, it is given as

det det  = det det det1 det1 .

(65)

naively, it equals to 1, but one should take into account that in the commuta-

tive case all determinants on r.h.s. are singular. regularizing them properly

it can be shown that (see e.g. [20]):

det det   exp{[]} , [] = 2q2

0z d(xi(~x))2 .

(66)

thus, there apears a chiral anomaly, the nontrivial quantum correction []

to the bosonic action (it generates a mass for an eective free bosonic eld).

in the noncommutative case the calculations are simple and straightfor-

ward. we quantize the model according to the general formula (63), however

there are important dierences:

i) we take the dynamical elds  = { , , } in the following form:

 =



xj=|k|1/2 x|m|j

[aj+
km

dj
k1/2,ma + ajkm

dj
k+1/2,ma]  sk ,

 =



xj=|k|1/2 x|m|j

[aj+

dj
k1/2,ma + aj
km

dj
k+1/2,ma]  sk ,

 =



xj=1 x|m|j

bj

dj
0m  h0 , bj

m = (1)mbjm .

(67)

20

we choose all expansion coecients without o(r1) terms (this xes the fuzzy
rules for dynamical elds).the pure gauge prepotential  is an arbitrary xed
hermitean operator from h0 (this xes the gauge).

ii) we implement a natural regularization induced by the noncommuative

geometry. we achieve this by xing j and taking the schwinger model eld

action in the form

k [ , , ] =
sj

1
2j

strn [ id ] +

1

4[(j + 1/2)2  k2]e2

o

strj

k [ f 20] .

(68)

here, eo is interaction constant specied below. in the rst term strn denotes
the supertrace in the space of mappings sfn  sfn . in the second term
strj
k . the gauge
degrees of freedom enters the action via operator  = eiei.

k denotes the supertrace in the space of mappings sj

k  sj

the denition (68) is an essential step. it implies that only a nite number

of dynamical modes takes part in the calculation of the action:

- the grassmannian spinor modes a0

km, a0

km (zero modes) and ajkm, ajkm

for j = |k| + 1/2,|k| + 3/2, . . . , j  1/2, |m|  j, and

- the bosonic modes bj

m with j = 1, . . . j + k, 0  m  j (the coecients

with negative m are given by bj

m = (1)mbjm ).

the quantum mean values are again dened by (63), however the measure

(d)j

k contains only relevant dynamical modes:

(d)j

dbj

j+k

ym=1

(69)

its dimension is nite, and consequently there are no uv divergencies. this

allows to calculate straightforwardly various non-perturbative quantities.

as an example, let us consider the problem of chiral anomaly. applying

the transformation (60) in the functional integral, we have to take into ac-
count that the spinor elds are restricted from sk to sj
k. the restricted
transformation (60) reads

fm,n1a + gm1,n a  m
f n,m1a + gn1,m a  f n,m1

fm,n1a + 1

m1ga ,

1
m1a + gn1,m

m a ,

(70)

(we put simply m instead of m m ). the jacobian of this transformation is

= (detm m )n (detm1 1

= (detm m

exp{j

k

k []}  (det det )j
m1)n +1 (detm m )n
m1)n +1 (detm1 1
1
m )n (detm1 1
m1)n +1 .
m1

(71)

this is an exact formula for the chiral anomaly in the noncommutative case.

obviously, it is gauge invariant.

note 1: replacing  in the transformation (60) by an arbitrary unitary
operator from h0 the corresponding determinant (71) will be equal to one.
this explicitely indicates, that the pure gauge factors ei can be absorbed

into spinor elds.

note 2: the formula for the chiral anomaly does not change if one adds

gauge invariant terms to the action (68), e.g.

m
2j

strn [  ] +

1
2j

strn [(  )2 + ( 0 )2] .

22

the rst term can be interpreted as a mass term for the eld , the second

one a particular 4-fermionic interaction. performing the spinor eld transfor-
mation (60) the fermionic elds 0, 0 does not separate from gauge degrees

of freedom: an integration over fermionic gives an additional contribution to

the eective gauge eld action besides fermionic determinant (71).

3.2 product formula and commutative limit

to nd the commutative limit we shall represent the operators from h0 in
the coherent state basis (for details see [9]). the formula for the coherent
states |~x; ni  fn reads

|~x; ni  |(~x); ni

:=

1
n

(+(~x))n|0i

=

n

xn=0s

n!

n!(n  n)!

n
1 ~xnn

2

~x|n, n  ni .

(72)

here ~x = +(~x)~(~x)  s2, (~x) is an arbitrary section of the bundle s3  s2
normalized by +(~x)(~x) = 1. for various (~x) the vectors |(~x); ni dier
just by a phase factor. let tn (),   su(2), is the su(2) group repre-
sentation of in fn corresponding to the canonical realization (10). putting
 = c + i~s.~, c 2 + ~s2 = 1, it can be shown that

wn (, ~x) := h~x; n|tn ()|~x; ni = (c + i~s.~x)n ,

(73)

(for ~s = (0, 0, s) the proof is straightforward, eq. (73) follows by rotational

invariance).

to any operator f  h0 we assign the function fn (~x) = h~x; n| f|~x; ni.
the normalized trace of the operator fn = f|fn in the coherent state basis

23

can be expressed as

1

n + 1

trn fn = z dfn (~x) .

(74)

the -product of two functions fn (~x) = h~x; n| f|~x; ni and gn (x) = h~x|g|~xi
is dened by

(fn  gn )(~x) = h~x; n| f g|~x; ni .

(75)

our aim is to express this -product directly in terms of fn (~x) and gn (~x)
and their derivatives. to achieve this let us express the operator fn as

fn = r dtn () f ()), d - haar measure. then fn (~x) = r d f ()wn (, ~x),
analogously, gn (~x) = r dg()wn (, ~x). from the relation tn ()tn () =

tn () and the den

ition of the -product it follows straightforwardly

(fn  gn )(~x) = z dd f ()g()wn (, ~x) .

putting  = c + i~s.~ and  = c + i~s.~ we obtain

wn (, ~x)

wn (, ~x)wn (, ~x)

=

where ij = iijkxk  xixj + ij. this induces the desired explicit -product
formula

(fn  gn )(~x) =

i1j1 . . . ikjk(i1 . . . ik fn )(~x) (j1 . . . jkgn )(~x) .

(76)

24

from (76) it follows the asymptotic formula for the k-th -power
(fn  . . .  fn )(~x) = f k

f k2
n (~x)(xifn (~x))2 + o(n2) .

k(k  1)

n (~x) +

2n

if f (z) is a polynomial (analytic function) this allows us to obtain the asymp-

totic formula linking fn (f )(x) to fn (x):

fn (f )(~x) = f (fn (~x)) +

1
2n

f (fn (~x)) (xifn (~x))2 + o(n2) .

(77)

this is the key formula we use for the calculation of the commutative limit

of the chiral anomaly.

applying it to the function  = exp[2eo] we obtain

()n (~x) = e2eon (~x) +

2e2
o
n

e2eon (~x)(xin (~x))2 + o(e2

on2) ,

or,

ln()n (~x) = 2eon (~x) +

2e2
o
n

(xin (~x))2 + o(e2

on2) .

(78)

this gives the asymptotic formula for the determinant

detn ()n = exp[trn ln()n ]

= exp{2e2

oz d(xin (x))2] + o(e2

on1)} ,

(79)

(the linear term in n (~x) in (78) does not contribute to the integral). using

(79) for both factors in the chiral anomaly formula (71) and renormalizing

the constant eo properly by 2je2
(j  , k - xed) the quantum correction j

o = q2

o, we obtain in the commutative limit

k [] to the bosonic action

j

k [] = 2q2

o z d(xi(x))2 + o(j1) .

(80)

25

here we have used relation r d(xin (x))2 = r d(xi(x))2 + o(n3) which

is valid provided that the commutative prepotential (~x) leads to a nite

contribution to the commutative gauge eld eld action (59). eq.

(80)

reproduces the standard commutative result (66).

note: let us we replace the factorials in (76) by -functions and n in the

arguments by a real parameter 1. performing a power expansion in  we

obtain, for generic , a divergent but borel summable series corresponding to

the kontsevich quantization formula, [26]. for the critical values  = n1

the formal power series quantization is unitarizable and reduces to the one

described by (76).

4 concluding remarks

the essential steps in our approach to the fuzzy schwinger model can be

summarized as follows:

i) in order to guarantee the gauge invariance we have to work with all

(fuzzy) canonical realizations of elds (i.e. elds are realized as operators in

the fock space and not as some nite dimensional matrices).

ii) we have been able to dene the rotationally invariant eld action

containing only nite number of modes of dynamical elds, i.e. with respect

to the dynamical modes the resulting model is nite dimensional (matrix)

model. such mode restriction is not possible for the pure gauge prepotential

.

iii) the dynamical modes were quantized within functional integral ap-

proach, and  appears as a background eld. however, the quantum mean

26

values of gauge invariant functionals do not depend on a particular choice

of , it can be xed arbitrarily (e.g.  = 0). the resulting model for dy-

mamical modes is a nite dimensional matrix model, and consequently is

nonperturbatively uv-regular.

iv) in a simple and direct way we derived an exact formula for the chi-
ral anomaly. using the explicit formula for the -product on a sphere we
recovered in the commutative limit the standard reasult.

it would be desirable to generalize the model to 4d case. this will be

not straightforward, since various steps in our construction are linked with

the particular properties of 2d sphere. however, one can expect that some

specic features will survive in 4d.
