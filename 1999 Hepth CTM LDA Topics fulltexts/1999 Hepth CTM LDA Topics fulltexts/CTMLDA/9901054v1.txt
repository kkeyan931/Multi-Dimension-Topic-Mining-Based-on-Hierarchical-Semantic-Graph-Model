anomalies and analytic torsion on

abstract. the global additive and multiplicative properties of
the laplacian on j forms and related zeta functions are analyzed.
the explicit form of zeta functions on a product of closed oriented
hyperbolic manifolds \hd and of the multiplicative anomaly are
derived. we also calculate in an explicit form the analytic torsion
associated with a connected sum of such manifolds.

1. introduction

the additive and multiplicative properties of (pseudo-) dierential
operators as well as properties of their determinants have been studied
actively during recent years in the mathematical and physical liter-
ature. the anomaly associated with product of regularized determi-
nants of operators can be expressed by means of the non-commutative
residue, the wodzicki residue [1] (see also refs.
[2, 3]). the wodz-
icki residue, which is the unique extension of the dixmier trace to the
wider class of (pseudo-) dierential operators [4, 5], has been consid-
ered within the non-commutative geometrical approach to the standard
model of the electroweak interactions [6, 7, 8] and the yang-mills ac-
tion functional. some recent papers along these lines can be found in
refs. [9, 10, 11, 12].

the product of two (or more) dierential operators of laplace type
can arise in higher derivative eld theories (for example, in higher de-
rivative quantum gravity [13]). the zeta function associated to the
product of laplace type operators acting in irreducible rank 1 sym-
metric spaces and the explicit form of the multiplicative anomaly have
been derived in [11].

under such circumstances we should note that the conformal defor-
mation of a metric and the corresponding conformal anomaly can also
play an important role in quantum theories with higher derivatives.
it is well known that evaluation of the conformal anomaly is actually

possible only for even dimensional spaces and up to now its computa-
tion is extremely involved. the general structure of such an anomaly
in curved d-dimensional spaces (d even) has been studied in [14]. we
briey mention here analysis related to this phenomenon for constant
curvature spaces. the conformal anomaly calculation for the d di-
mensional sphere can be found, for example, in ref. [15]. the explicit
computation of the anomaly (of the stress-energy tensor) in irreducible
rank 1 symmetric spaces has been carried out in [16, 17, 18] using the
zeta-function regularization and the selberg trace formula.

recently the topology of manifolds have been studied by means of
quantum eld theory methods. in this approach the partition function
of quadratic functionals play an important role. it has been shown that
the analytic or ray-singer torsion (a topological invariant) [19] occurs
within quantum eld theory as the partition function of a certain qua-
dratic functional [20, 21]. recall that ray-singer torsion tan(x) is
dened for every closed riemannian manifold x and orthogonal rep-
resentation  of 1(x). the denition of the torsion involves the spec-
it has been proved in
trum of the laplacian on twisted j forms.
[22, 23] that when  is acyclic and orthogonal the value tan(x) coin-
cides with the so-called reidemeister torsion, which can be computed
from twisted cochain complex of a nite complex by taking a suitable
alternating product of determinants [24].

the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the spectral zeta
functions associated with a product and kronecker sum of laplacians
on j forms and to calculate in an explicit form the analytic torsion
on closed oriented hyperbolic manifolds \hd and on a connected sum
of such manifolds.

2. the spectral zeta function and the trace formula

we shall be working with irreducible rank 1 symmetric spaces x =
g/k of non-compact type. thus g will be a connected non-compact
simple split rank 1 lie group with nite center and k  g will be
a maximal compact subgroup. up to local isomorphism we choose
x = so1(d, 1)/so(d). thus the isotropy group k of the base point
(1, 0, ...0) is so(d); x can be identied with hyperbolic d space hd,
it is possible to view hd, for example, as one sheet of
d = dimx.

... + x2
d = 1, x0 > 0 with the metric induced by the quadratic form
q(x). let   g be a discrete, co-compact, torsion free subgroup, and
let () = trace(()) be the character of a nite-dimensional unitary
representation  of  for   . let l(j)  (j)

of h0 by (h0) = 1, where  : a0  r is the positive root which denes

here c is a complete set of representatives in  of its conjugacy
classes; haar measure on g is suitably normalized. in our case k 
so(d), m  so(d 1). for j = 0 (i.e. for smooth functions or smooth
vector bundle sections) the measure 0(r) corresponds to the trivial
representation of m. for j  1 there is a measure (r) corresponding
to a general irreducible representation  of m. let j is the standard
representation of m = so(d  1) on j c(d1). if d = 2n is even then
j (0  j  d  1) is always irreducible; if d = 2n + 1 the every j
is irreducible except for j = (d  1)/2 = n, in which case n is the
direct sum of two (1/2) spin representations  : n = +  . for
j = n the representation n of k = so(2n) on nc2n is not irreducible,

tive properties of determinants, the multiplicative anomaly [38, 2, 3].

3.2. the residue formula and the multiplicative anomaly. the
value of f (l1,l2) can be expressed by means of the non-commutative
wodzicki residue [1]. let op, p = 1, 2, be invertible elliptic (pseudo-)
dierential operators of real non-zero orders  and  such that  +
 6= 0. even if the zeta functions for operators o1,o2 and o1no2
are well dened and if their principal symbols satisfy the agmon-
nirenberg condition (with appropriate spectra cuts) one has in general
that f (o1,o2) 6= 1. for such invertible elliptic operators the formula
for the anomaly of commuting operators holds:

the anomaly can be iterated consistently. indeed, using eq. (3.18) we

4. the conformal anomaly and associated operator

products.

in this section we start with a conformal deformation of a metric and
the conformal anomaly of the energy stress tensor. it is well known
that (pseudo-) riemannian metrics g(x) and g(x) on a manifold
x are (pointwise) conformal if g(x) = exp(2f )g(x), f  c (r).
for constant conformal deformations the variation of the connected
vacuum functional (the eective action) can be expressed in terms of
the generalized zeta function related to an elliptic self-adjoint operator
o [13]:

w = (0|o) log 2 = zx

< t(x) > g(x)dx,

(4.1)

where < t(x) > means that all connected vacuum graphs of the
stress-energy tensor t(x) are to be included. therefore eq. (4.1)
leads to

thus in conformally invariant scalar theory the anomaly of the stress

5. product of einstein manifolds

in this section we consider the problem of the global existence of
zeta functions on (pseudo-) riemannian product manifolds, a product
of two einstein manifolds [39, 40]

(x, g,p) = (x1, g1,p1)  (x2, g2,p2),

where g = g1  g2 and the metric g separates the variables, i.e.

(5.1)

ds2 = g(x)dx  dx + g(y)dy  dy.

(5.2)
the tangent bundle splits as t x = t x1  t x2 and p = p1 + p2,
where pp (p = 1, 2) are the corresponding projections on t xp,
g(px ,py) = g(x ,y), x ,y  g(x),

p 2 = id,

(5.3)

12 a.a. bytsenko, a.e. gonc alves, m. sim oes, and f.l. williams
and g(x) being the lie algebra of vector elds x and y on x. the
trivial examples of an almost-product structure are given by the choices
p = id ( identity).
we recall some facts about einstein manifolds. an almost-product
(pseudo-) riemannian structure (x, g,p) is integrable i p = 0 for
the levi-civita connection  of g. the two integrable complementary
subbundles, i.e. both foliations, are totally geodesic [39, 40]. let x be
a pseudo-kahler manifold. such a manifold is an einstein manifold i
in any adapted coordinates (x, y) both metrics g1 and g2 are einstein
metrics for the same constant  [39, 40, 41], i.e.

ric(g) = g.

(5.4)
our consideration will be restricted to only locally decomposable man-
ifolds. a wide class of (pseudo-) riemannian manifolds includes non-
locally decomposable manifolds as well, which are given by warped
product space-times [42, 43, 44]. note that many exact solutions of
einstein equations (associated with schwarzschild, robertson-walker,
reissner- nordstrom, de sitter space-times) and p-brane solutions are,
in fact, warped product space-times.

6. quadratic functional with elliptic resolvent and

analytic torsion

let  : 1(x) 7 o(v,h ,iv ) be a representation of 1(x) on
a real vector space v . the mapping  determines (on the basis of a
standard construction in dierential geometry) a real at vector bundle
 over x and a at connection map d on the space (x, ) of dif-
ferential forms on x with values in . one can say that  determines
the space of smooth sections in the vector bundle (t x)  .
and let

let dj denote the restriction of d to the space j(x, ) of j forms

h j(d) = ker(dj) [im(dj1)]1

(6.1)
be the corresponding cohomology spaces. there exists a canonical
hermitian structure on the bundle  which we denote by h ,iv . the
above mentioned hermitian structure determines for each x  x a
linear map h ,ix : x  x 7 r, and the diagram for linear maps hold
(see ref. [45] for details)

(p(txx)  x)  (q(txx)  x) 7 p+q(txx)  (x  x)
(6.2)
where the image of x  x under the rst map has been denote by
hx  xix.

7 p+q(txx),

we dene the quadratic functional sd on j(x, ) by

h ,ix

sd() = zxh(x)  (dj)(x)ix.

(6.3)

one can construct from the metric on x and hermitian structure in
 a hermitian structure in (txx)   and the inner products h ,ij
in the space j(x, ). thus

sd() = h, t ij,
(6.4)
where () is the hodge-star map. recall that the map t is formally self
adjoint with the property t 2 = d
j dj. let (jp, dp) be a complex, i.e.
a sequence of vector space jp and linear operators dp acting from the

t = dj,

anomalies and analytic torsion

15

space jp to the space jp+1, (j1 = jd+1) and satisfying dp+1dp = 0 for
all p = 0, 1, ..., d. let us dene the adjoint operators d
p : jp+1 7 jp
by < a, dpb >p+1=< d
pa, b >p. for the functional (6.3) there is a
canonical topological elliptic resolvent r(sd) (a chain of linear maps)

0 07 0(x, ) d0

7 ...

dd2

dd1

7 d1(x, )

(6.5)
(6.5) it follows that for r(sd) we have h p(r(sd)) =

from eq.
h dp(d) and ker(sd)  ker(t ) = ker(dj).
let us choose an inner product h ,ih p in each space h p(r(sd)).
the partition function of sd associated to points in the moduli space
of at gauge elds (x) on x with the resolvent (6.5) can be written
in the form (see for example ref. [45])

07 0.

z()  z(; r(sd),h ,ih,h ,i) = t(, , ) (x, ,h ,ih)1/2,

where  = i,   r, t(, , ) is known function of . the function
 appearing in the partition function above can be expressed in terms
of the dimensions of the cohomology spaces of d,

the dependence of  = (0|td) on the connection map d can be ex-

it can be

the metric-dependence of  enters through lr(t x) and (0|td(0)),
where lr(t x) is the rth term in hirzebruchs l-polynomial (see

16 a.a. bytsenko, a.e. gonc alves, m. sim oes, and f.l. williams

[46]) and d(0) is an arbitrary at connection map on
for detail ref.
(x, ). for d = 3 the only contribution of the l-polynomial is l0 = 1
and the metric-dependance of  is determined alone by (0|td(0)).
the factor  (x, ,h ,ih) is independent of the choice of metric
in fact this quantity is associated with the analytic

 (x, ,h ,ih) = tan(x)  vol(x)dimh 0(d),

(6.11)
is independant of the choice of metric g, i.e. the metric dependence of
the ray-singer torsion tan(x) factors out as vol(x)dimh 0(d).

6.1. connected sum of 3-manifolds. recall that an embedding of
the cohomology h(x; ) into (x; ) as the space of harmonic forms
induces a norm |  |rs on the determinant line deth(x; ). the ray-
singer norm ||  ||rs on deth(x; ) is dened by [19]

(6.12)

where the zeta function (s|l(j)) of the laplacian acting on the space of
j forms orthogonal to the harmonic forms has been used. for a closed
connected orientable smooth manifold of odd dimension and for any
euler structure   eul(x) the ray-singer norm of its cohomological
torsion tan(x, )  deth(x; ) is equal to the positive square root
of the absolute value of the monodromy of  along the characteristic
class c()  h 1(x) [47]: ||tan(x)||rs = |detc()|1/2. in the special
case where the at bundle  is acyclic (h q(x; ) = 0 for all q) we have

[tan(x, )]2 = |detc()|

(6.13)
if  is unimodular then |detc()| = 1 and the torsion tan(x) does
not depend on the choice of . for odd-dimensional manifold the
ray-singer norm is a topological invariant:
it does not depend on
the choice of metric on x and , used in the construction. but for
even-dimensional x this is not the case [48].

suppose the at bundle  is acyclic. the analytic torsion tan(\h3)
can be expressed in terms of the selberg zeta functions zj(s, j). in-
deed the ruell zeta function in three dimension associated with the
closed oriented hyperbolic manifold x = \h3 has the form

in chern-simons theory the partition function at level k ( = 2k)
depends on a framing (i.e. on a trivialization of the normal bundle to
the link) of twice the tangent bundle as a spin (6) bundle, henceforth
referred to as 2-framing. in particular for the su(2) theory in the large
k limit the partition function for a connected sum x = x,1# x,2#

in the case of non-trivial characters b0(x,) = 0. if b1 = 0 then eq.
(6.15) holds.

for the trivial character one has b0 = 1 (for any closed manifold) and
b1 = 0 for an innite number of x = \h3. the function r(s) has a
zero at s = 0 of order 4 [26]. however, there is a class of compact su-
ciently large hyperbolic manifolds which admit arbitrarly large values
of b1(x). suciently large manifolds x contain a surface s whose
fundamental group 1(s) is innite and such that 1(s)  1(x).
it seems that the most important problem in 3-topology is the clas-
sication problem.
in general, hyperbolic manifolds have not been
completely classied and therefore a systematic computation is not
yet possible. however this is not the case for certain suciently large
manifolds, the haken manifolds [53]. there exists an algorithm for
the enumeration of all haken manifolds and there exists an algorithm
for recognizing homeomorphy of the haken manifolds [54]. both al-
gorithms depend on normal surface theory in the manifold, developed
primarily by haken. these manifolds give an essentional contribution
to the partition function (6.19).

7. concluding remarks

we have obtained an explicit formula for the multiplicative anomaly
(theorem 3.5.). the anomaly is equal to zero for d = 2 and for the odd
dimensional cases. we have preferred to limit ourselves here to discuss
in detail various particular cases and emphasize the general picture.
it seems to us that the explicit results for the anomaly (3.20), (3.22)
are not only interesting as mathematical results but are of physical
interest.

besides we have considered product structures on closed real hy-
perbolic manifolds. in fact the explicit form of the zeta function on
product spaces (theorem 5.1.)
is derived. as an example the zeta
function associated with the kronecker sum of laplacians on twisted
forms is calculated in two-dimensional case.

finally the explicit formulae for analytic torsion tan(x) (a topo-
logical invariant) on manifolds x = \hd and on a connected sum of
such manifolds are derived. we hope that proposed discussion of this
invariants will be interesting in view of future applications to concrete
problems in quantum eld theory.
