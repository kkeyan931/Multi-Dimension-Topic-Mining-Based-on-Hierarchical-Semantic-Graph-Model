abstract

we present a detailed discussion of the asymptotic symmetries of anti-de sitter space in
two dimensions and their relationship with the conformal group in one dimension. we
use this relationship to give a microscopical derivation of the entropy of 2d black holes
that have asymptotically anti-de sitter behaviour. the implications of our results for
the conjectured ads2 /cft1 duality are also discussed.

1 introduction

an important realization of the holographic principle [1], stating that a bulk theory with
gravity is equivalent to a boundary theory without gravity, is the anti-de sitter (ads)/ con-
formal eld theory (cft) correspondence [2]. according to it, supergravity on d-dimensional
ads space should be dual to a conformal eld theory living on its d  1-dimensional bound-
ary. for d > 4 the ads/cft correspondence has been used to gain informations about the
nonperturbative regime of yang mills theories, i.e. to learn about eld theory from gravity.
for d < 4 the conformal symmetry is innite dimensional, so that one expects the opposite
to be true, i.e. one should learn about gravity from eld theory.

a nice example of how this could work is represented by the d = 3 case.

it is well
known since the work of brown and henneaux [3] that the asymptotic symmetry group of
ads3 is the conformal group in two dimensions. this fact was the starting point of the
investigations of strominger who used two-dimensional (2d) conformal eld theories results
to understand black hole physics. he calculated the entropy of the three-dimensional (3d)
banados-teitelboim-zanelli (btz) black hole by counting states of the 2d conformal theory
living on the boundary of ads3 [4]. a nice feature of this microscopical derivation of the
black hole entropy is that it does not use string theory or supersymmetry, but just general
properties of 3d gravity.

gravity in three spacetime dimensions is rather peculiar, it is a topological theory. for
instance, the gauge theoretical formulation of 3d gravity has been used by carlip [5] to
give a further statistical derivation of the btz black hole entropy that relies neither on
supersymmetry nor on string theory.
it is therefore of interest to study the other low-
dimensional element of the set of the ads/cft dualities, namely d = 2, in order to see if
the features of d = 3 survive in this case.

there are also other reasons to study the ads2 /cft1 correspondence. ads2 appears as
solution of a broad class of 2d dilaton gravity theories. the same theories have been widely
used in the past years to investigate black hole physics in a simplied context [6]. moreover,
it appears as near-horizon description of a variety of black solutions of string theory. the
simplest case, actually, comes from general relativity. the near-horizon geometry of the
extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole, the bertotti-robinson solution, is ads2 s2.
presently, we do not know very much about the ads2 /cft1 duality. previous work on
the subject (and related topics) concerned mainly the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 [7],
string theory on ads2 [8], or the use of the conformal symmetry to describe the near-horizon
regime of black holes [9].

in this paper we present a detailed investigation of the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 ,
their relationship with the conformal group in d = 1 and their use for deriving microscopically
the entropy of 2d black holes. we use as a framework for our investigation 2d dilaton gravity
models. among others, we analyse in detail the jackiw-teitelboim (jt) [10] model. this
choice is motivated by the fact that it is the simplest 2d gravity model that admits ads2
as solution. moreover, in the context of the jt model, ads2 can be thought of as a s1
compactication of ads3, with the dilaton playing the role of the radius of s1. some of the
results presented here have been anticipated in a previous paper [11].

the structure of the paper is as follows. in sect. 2 we discuss the asymptotic symmetries
of ads2 . in particular we show how the sl(2,r) isometry group of ads2 can be promoted

1

to an innite dimensional symmetry on the boundary, generated by a virasoro algebra. in
sect. 3 we discuss the conformal group in d = 1 and its relationship with the asymptotic
symmetries of ads2 .
in sect. 4 we discuss the canonical realization of the symmetries
and calculate the central charge of the virasoro algebra. in sect. 5 we give a microscopical
derivation of the entropy of the black hole solutions of the jt model and compare it with
the thermodynamical entropy.
in sect. 6 we extend the derivation of sect. 5 to generic
black hole solutions that are asymptotically anti-de sitter. finally in sect. 7 we discuss the
ads2 /cft1 duality.

2 asymptotic symmetries of ads2

two-dimensional spacetimes that are asymptotically anti-de sitter appear as dynamical
solutions of dilatonic gravity in two dimensions [12, 13]. among these of particular interest
are spacetimes with constant negative curvature (in the following they will be referred to as
ads2 )

r = 22.

(1)

(2)

anti-de sitter spaces are, for instance, solutions of the jt model, whose action is

a =

1

2 z g d2x (cid:16)r + 22(cid:17) ,

where  is a scalar eld related to the usual denition of the dilaton  by  = exp(2). the
geometrical and topological properties of ads2 have been already discussed in the literature
[12, 13]. here we will just briey remind to the reader those features that are relevant for
our discussion. owing to birkhos theorem of 2d dilaton gravity the general solution of eq.
(1), in a schwarzschild gauge, takes the form

ds2 = (2x2  a2)dt2 + (2x2  a2)1dx2,

while the dilaton is given by

 = 0x,

(3)

(4)

where 0 and a2 are integration constants. two-dimensional dilaton gravity does not allow a
dimensionful analog of the newton constant. however, it is evident from the action (2) that
the inverse of the scalar eld  represents the (coordinate dependent) coupling constant of
the theory, whereas the inverse of the integration constant 0 in eq. (4) plays the role of a
dimensionless 2d newton constant.

all the solutions (3) are locally anti-de sitter , but have dierent global properties. they
represent dierent parametrizations of the same manifold, with coordinates patches covering
dierent regions of the space.
in fact, given the generic solution, one can always nd a
coordinate transformation that brings the metric into the form [12]

ds2 = (2x2 + 1)dt2 + (2x2 + 1)1dx2,

(5)

which represents full ads2 , a nonsingular, geodesically complete spacetime. at rst sight
the equivalence of all the metrics (3) up to coordinate transformations seems to indicate that

2

the solution to eq. (1) is unique and makes it very dicult to interpret the solutions with
a2 > 0 as 2d black holes. on the other hand, in the context of 2d dilaton gravity models,
also the scalar  must be taken into account in the discussion of the causal structure of
the spacetime. in general a non-constant dilaton represents an obstruction that prevents a
maximal extension of the spacetime. if one considers for instance the solutions (3), (4) of the
jt model, one sees that positivity of  prevents the analytical continuation of the spacetime
beyond x = 0. moreover, for x = 0 the (coordinate-dependent) coupling constant of the
theory diverges, therefore x = 0 has to be considered as a singularity of the 2d spacetime.
for this reason, in the context of 2d dilaton gravity, one must regard the solutions with
a2 positive, negative or zero as physically nonequivalent. following the notation of ref. [12]
the corresponding spacetimes will be respectively denoted by ads+
2 . ads+
2
can be interpreted as a black hole with a x = 0 singularity, a x =  timelike boundary,
an event horizon at x = a/ and a mass given by

2 , ads0

m =

ads0

2 can be considered as the ground state, zero mass solution and the x = 0 singular-

ity becomes lightlike. finally, for ads

2 , x = 0 becomes timelike.

2 and ads0

2 and ads+

it is important to stress that owing to the presence of the dilaton the global topology of
both ads0
2 is dierent from that of full ads2. the metric (5) represents a geodesi-
cally complete spacetime of cylindrical topology with two timelike boundaries, whereas both
ads+
2 , due to the x = 0 singularity, have to be considered as singular spacetimes
with only one timelike boundary at x = .
ating the so(1, 2)  sl(2, r) group of isometries. in the case of ads0
vectors have the form
4x2(cid:19) 

ads2 is a maximally symmetric space, it admits, therefore, three killing vectors gener-

in the case of ads+
however, all the solutions (3) admit the killing vector

2 and ads

2 the sl(2, r) symmetry is realised dierently than in eq. (7).

the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 are by denition the subgroup of the 2d dieo-
morphisms group that leaves the metric asymptotically invariant. actually, because we are
considering ads2 as dynamical solutions of 2d dilaton gravity, we should impose asymptotic
invariance also on the scalar . this condition for a scalar is in general too restrictive.
in the following we will therefore use a milder condition on the behaviour of  under the
transformations of the asymptotic symmetry group. a useful application of the concept of
asymptotic symmetry is to use it to dene the global charges of the theory. the natural
framework for the denition of the charges is the hamiltonian formalism, where they appear
as generators of the asymptotic symmetries. the canonical realization of the asymptotic
symmetries will be discussed in sect. 4.

by requiring the metric to be of the form (3), one nds that the asymptotic symmetry
group of ads2 is the group of time-translations t generated by the killing vector (1) in
eq.
(7). the global charge associated with this symmetry is just the arnowitt-deser-
misner (adm) mass of the solution (6). this requirement appears however too restrictive

3

and does not correspond to the intuitive notion of asymptotically anti-de sitter. as we
shall see in sect. 6, there are solutions of 2d dilaton gravity that describe spaces whose
curvature is only asymptotically constant and diers from eq. (1) by terms of o(x1). one
has to choose boundary conditions for the metric at x   such that they correspond
to the intuitive notion of asymptotically anti-de sitter, are weak enough to enlarge the
asymptotic symmetry group to a group larger than t but tight enough to allow for a well-
dened denition of the charges associated with the symmetry. the previous requirements
single out the following boundary conditions on the metric for x  ,

x3(cid:19) ,

gxx 

1

2x2 + o(cid:18) 1

x4(cid:19) .

(8)

solving the killing equations for metrics of the form (8), one nds that the asymptotic
symmetries are generated by the killing vectors

t = t (t) +

(9)

where t is an arbitrary function of the time t.

the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 appear as the subgroup of the dieomorphisms of
the bulk 2d gravity theory, dened by eq. (9). it is evident from the expression of the
killing vectors that these symmetries act in a natural way on the one-dimensional, timelike,
x  , boundary of ads2 as time-reparametrizations. this point will be discussed in detail
in sect. 3. notice that dieomorphisms of the bulk with t = 0 represent pure gauge
transformations on the boundary, because they fall o rapidly as x  .
the boundary conditions (8) must be completed by giving boundary conditions for the
dilaton. in general the solution for the dilaton is model-dependent, here we consider only the
case of a linear scalar eld  of the form (4). this is the most common case in the context of
2d dilaton gravity models. the variation of the scalar eld  under the transformations (9)
is given by l = , which is asymptotically o(x) for  of the form (4), and hence of
the same order as the eld itself. this is quite disturbing, but is an inescapable consequence
of the scalar nature of the dilaton. thus, we require the asymptotic behaviour of the dilaton
to be

  o(x).

(10)

the appearance of the function t (t) in eq. (9) indicates that the asymptotic symmetry
group of ads2 is generated by an innite dimensional algebra. since anti-de sitter space
has a natural periodicity in t, it is convenient to expand the function t (t) in a fourier series
in the interval 0 < t < 2/. the generators of the asymptotic symmetries then read,

where k is an integer. one can easily verify that the generators satisfy the commutation

(12)

the algebra can be put in a more familiar form by dening new generators lk = (bkiak),
(13)

[lk, ll] = (k  l)lk+l.

the algebra (13) is easily recognised as a virasoro algebra. as expected, it contains as a
subalgebra the sl(2, r) algebra, generated by l0, l1, l1.

it is interesting to notice that the algebra generating the asymptotic symmetries of ads2
can be thought of as half of the algebra generating the asymptotic symmetries of ads3 . in
fact the asymptotic symmetries of ads3 are generated by two copies of the virasoro algebra
[3]. this is exactly the symmetry of the 2d conformal theory living on the 2d boundary of
ads3 . as we shall see in the next sections this fact plays an important role in the discussion
of the theory living on the one-dimensional boundary of ads2 that should give a realization
of the symmetry (13).

the interpretation of the asymptotic symmetries of ads2 as half of the symmetries of a 2d
conformal eld theory has a natural explanation using light-cone coordinates to parametrize
ads2 . in the conformal gauge

ds2 = e2dx+dx,
the metric of ads2 can be written in the form [12, 13]

(14)

(15)

(16)

e2 =

4
2 (x+  x)2.

in these coordinates the x   boundary is dened by x+ = x. by translating the
boundary conditions (8) and solving the killing equations in the new coordinates, one nds
that the asymptotic symmetries are generated by the killing vectors

+ = t +(x+) + o(cid:16)x+  x(cid:17) ,

 = t (x) + o(cid:16)x+  x(cid:17) ,

where t + = t  is an arbitrary function of x+ = x. when t + and t  are two independent
functions of the two light-cone coordinates (in 2d euclidean space the holomorphic and
antiholomorphic coordinates), eq. (16) denes the conformal group in 2d. the action of the
conformal group in 2d factorizes into independent actions on x and x+. it follows that the
asymptotic symmetries (16) can be considered as the subgroup of the conformal group in 2d
acting on the (timelike) curve x = x+ and characterised by the same action on holomorphic
and antiholomorphic coordinates.

3 conformal group in d=1

the conformal group on a at one-dimensional (1d), timelike, background is usually de-
ned [14] as the group so(1, 2)  sl(2, r), generated by the three generators h, d and
k, which satisfy the algebra

[h, d] = h,

[k, d] = k,

5

[h, k] = 2d.

(17)

the generator h acts as time translation t  t + a, d as time dilatation t  bt and k as a
combination of translations and a time inversion t  c/t. they can be realized as dierential
operators acting on 1d at space by writing

h =

d = t

k = t2

the generic transformation can also be written in a sl(2, r) fractional form as

t =

with    = 1,

where , , ,  are real parameters.

the lagrangian

l =

1

2   2 

g

2! ,

(18)

(19)

(20)

where g is a dimensionless coupling constant, is invariant under the 1d conformal group and
can be easily quantized. the quantum version of (20) has been largely studied under the
name of conformal quantum mechanics [14, 15].

it is interesting to see how the notion of conformal invariance generalizes when passing
to a general covariant setting. in curved spacetimes, conformal invariance is dened through
the existence of conformal killing vectors  such that

 +  = (x)g,

(21)

where (x) is an arbitrary function of the spacetime coordinates.
it is evident that in
one dimension this condition is empty, and hence t =  can be any function of t, namely,
conformal invariance coincides with invariance under dieomorphisms.
in particular, one
may expand  = f (t) in laurent series1, so that the killing vectors (k) = tk+1/t satisfy
the virasoro algebra

[(k), (l)] = (l  k)(k+l).

(22)

one easily sees that the subalgebra generated by l1, l0 and l1 coincides with (17).

from the previous discussion it follows that this symmetry is realized by any generally
covariant theory in one dimension. let us for instance consider a scalar eld in 1d curved
space. its lagrangian can be written as

l =

1
2e

2 +

1
2

ev (),

(23)

where e is the 1-bein. for v () = m2, this can be interpreted as the lagrangian for a free
particle moving in a higher dimensional curved spacetime [16]. the equations of motion give

(24)

1alternatively, if t is periodic, one can of course expand in fourier series.

under the transformations (22), e = (k) e + (k)e,  = (k) , and the lagrangian changes
by a total derivative

l =

as usual, it is possible to associate to these symmetries the conserved currents d(k):

d(k) =

2

it is easy to see that all the currents vanish due to the equations of motion (24) and the
symmetry is trivially realized.

if one tries to quantize the model, one should x the gauge and this of course spoils the
invariance. presently, we are not aware of any quantum mechanical model that realizes the
symmetries (22) in a non-trivial fashion.

4 canonical realization of the asymptotic symmetries

the connection between asymptotic symmetries and global charges of a theory is well-
known [17]. in particular, in the hamiltonian formalism the global charges appear as gen-
erators of the asymptotic symmetries of the theory. in order to discuss the implications for
2d anti-de sitter gravity, we briey recall the hamiltonian formulation of the jt model [18].
with the parametrization

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

the hamiltonian of the jt theory reads

ds2 = n 2dt2 + 2(dx + n xdt)2,

n and n x act, as usual, as lagrange multipliers enforcing the constraints,

h = z dx(nh + n xhx).

h =  + 1  2  2 = 0,
hx =   

 = 0,

where

 = n 1(  + (n x)),

 = n 1(  + n x),

are the momenta canonically conjugate to  and , respectively. a dot denotes derivative
with respect to t and a prime with respect to x.

when the spacelike slices are non-compact, however, in order to have well-dened vari-
ational derivatives, one must add to the hamiltonian a surface term j, which in general
depends on the boundary conditions imposed on the elds [17]. in our case, the boundary
reduces to a point and the variation j of the surface term must be given by2

j =  lim

x

[n(1  2)  n (1) + n x(  )].

(31)

2as we shall discuss in the following, this variation is well dened only when an integration on t is

performed.

7

one can then evaluate the hamilton equations, which read

 = 2n  2n  + 
 = 2n  2n   1n  + 

n x,

n x + n x

(32)

together with (30).

in the hamiltonian formalism, the symmetries associated with the killing vectors  are

generated by the phase space functionals h[], dened as [19]

h[] = z dx(h + khx) + j[],

(33)

where  = nt, k = x + n xt. the surface term j[] can be interpreted as the charge
associated with the killing vector .

the charges j[] are dened up to the addition of an arbitrary constant, and this ambi-
guity signals the possible appearance of central charges in the realization of the symmetries.
in fact, the poisson bracket algebra of h[] yields in general a projective representation of
the asymptotic symmetry group [3]:

{h[], h[]} = h[[, ]] + c(, ),

(34)

where c(, ) are the central charges of the algebra.

in view of the boundary conditions discussed in sect. 2, in our case the functional j[]

can be written in nite form as

j[] = lim

we still have to evaluate the central charge. the calculation can be performed in two
dierent ways: one can either compute explicitly the poisson brackets (34), or can x the
gauge so that the constraints h = 0, hx = 0 hold strongly. in the latter case, the charges
j[] give themselves a realization of the asymptotic symmetry group through the dirac
brackets, namely [3],

but the dirac brackets can also be expressed in terms of the variation of j[] under surface
deformations as

{j[], j[]}db = j[[, ]] + c(, ).

(37)

(38)

j[] = {j[], j[]}db.

comparing (37) and (38) and evaluating them on a background with vanishing charges,
one can then obtain the central charge c(, ) as the charge j[] evaluated on the surface
deformed by .

8

in two dimensions, however, the previous calculation runs into problems. in fact, being
the boundary a point, the functional derivatives appearing in the poisson bracket (34) can be
dened only for pure gauge transformations, for which the charge j[] vanishes. moreover,
the dirac brackets (37) have no meaning as long as the x   boundary is a point. as a
consequence, the surface deformation algebra has no denite action on the charges j[], and
eqs. (37) and (38) cannot be used to calculate the central charge.

one can remedy these diculties by dening the time-independent charges

j[] =



2 z 2/

0

dt j[].

(39)

the functional derivatives of j [] can be easily dened, so that the dirac bracket algebra
{ j[], j[]}db has a denite meaning. one can also verify that the action of the surface
deformation on the charges j[] gives a realization of the algebra (12).
replacing in eq. (37) and (38) the charges j[] with j[], and evaluating on a ads0
2

background, one can easily calculate the central charges . one gets,

c(ak, al) = c(bk, bl) = 0,

c(ak, bl) = 0k3|k| |l|.

(40)

also a direct calculation of the poisson brackets (34) requires the introduction of a time
integration in order to be well dened when j[] does not vanish. dening h in analogy
with j, a straightforward calculation gives, taking into account the asymptotic conditions
imposed on the elds,

{ h[], h[]} = h[[, ]] + lim
k)2x  (k  k)] (41)
evaluating the integral in the above expression, one recovers the values (40) for the central
charges.

k

as noticed before, apart from j[a0], which gives the mass m of the solution, the other
charges j[ak] are in general time-dependent. this means that besides the mass there are
no conserved quantities. this fact is strongly related to the presence of the dilaton and its
behaviour under the transformations (11). on the other hand all the charges j vanish when
2 with the exception of j[a0]. they represent a sort of time-averaged
evaluated on ads+
charges that can be used to give a canonical representation of the algebra (12).

finally, we notice that dening the new generators lk = (bk  iak), and shifting l0
by a constant, l0  l0  0, one obtains the standard form of the virasoro algebra with
central charge,

[lk, ll] = (k  l)lk+l +

statistical entropy of 2d black holes

a nice application of the results of the previous sections is a microscopical computa-
tion of the entropy of 2d black holes. before calculating the entropy microscopically, let
us rst review some general facts and the peculiarity of the thermodynamical entropy in
in two spacetime dimensions we do not have an area law for the black
two-dimensions.

9

hole entropy. the thermodynamical entropy can be computed using several methods. for
instance, using noether charge techniques one nds the general formula [20]

s = 2y |h,

(43)

where the subscript h means that the expression has to be evaluated at the black hole horizon
and the tensor y  is dened in terms of the derivatives of the lagrangian l, characterizing
the model, with respect to the curvature tensor r:

y  =

l

r

.

(44)

using eq. (43) one nds for the entropy associated with the black solutions of a generic 2d
dilaton gravity model,

s = 2h,

(45)

where h is the value of the scalar eld  at the horizon. although in two spacetime dimen-
sions we do not have an area law for the black hole entropy, eq. (45) can be interpreted as
a generalization to 2d of the bekenstein-hawking entropy. this follows simply from the fact
that according to eq. (4),  is nothing but the radial coordinate of the 2d space.

using eq. (45) one can easily calculate the thermodynamical entropy associated with

the black hole (3) . we have [12]:

s = 4s 0m

2

.

(46)

one can also derive the same result by integrating the thermodynamical relation t ds = dm,
given the temperature t as a function of the mass m.

our derivation of the statistical entropy of 2d black holes follows closely that of stro-
minger for the btz black hole [4]. we just need to count the excitations around the vacuum
ads0
2 with m given, in the semiclassical approximation of large m. because states on the 2d
bulk are in correspondence with states living on the x  , boundary we can equivalently
count excitations on the boundary. in the semiclassical regime m/ >> c, the density of
states is given by the cardys formula [21]:

s = 2s c l0

6

,

(47)

where l0 is the eigenvalue of the virasoro generator l0, which for a black hole of mass m is
given by3

l0 =

m


.

(48)

inserting eq. (48) and the value of the central charge c given by eq. (42) into eq. (47), we
nd for the statistical entropy,

3the shift in l0 performed in the previous section in order to obtain the virasoro algebra in its standard

form can be neglected for large m .

10

s = 4s 0m



,

(49)

which agrees, up to a factor 2, with the thermodynamical result (46).

because we do not have an explicit representation of the degrees of freedom living in
the boundary, it is very dicult to explain the discrepancy between the statistical and
the thermodynamical result. nevertheless, a simple justication of the factor 2 can be
found if one considers the model (2) as a circular symmetric dimensional reduction of three-
dimensional gravity, with the eld  parametrizing the radius of the circle. using the notation
of ref. [4], the 2d dilaton gravity action (2) can be obtained from the 3d one by means of
the ansatz,

ds2

(3) = ds2

(2) + 16g2d2,

(50)
where g is the 3d newton constant and 0    2. the 2d black hole (3) can be considered
as the dimensional reduction of the zero angular momentum (j = 0) btz black hole. simple
calculations show that both the mass and the thermodynamical entropy of the btz black
hole agree with our 2d results, given respectively by eq. (6) and eq. (46). the same is
not true for the statistical entropy. from the 3d point of view we have contributions to
the mass of the 2d black hole coming from both the right- and left-movers oscillators of the
2d conformal eld theory living on the boundary of ads3. since j = 0 implies that the
number of right-movers equals that of left-movers, we have l0 = m/2, which inserted into
the cardys formula reproduces the thermodynamical entropy (46). from the 2d point of
view only oscillators of one sector contribute to the mass of the black hole giving l0 = m/
and the statistical entropy (49).

these results are in accordance with those obtained by strominger in ref.

[8], where
ads2 is generated as the near-horizon, near-extremal limit of ads3. at rst sight these
results seem to imply that there is no intrinsical 2d explanation of the statistical entropy of
2d black holes. this is certainly true as long as the eld  is interpreted as the radius of
the internal circle, because the x   boundary of ads2 corresponds to the    region,
where the internal circle decompacties and the 2d theory becomes intrinsically 3d.
the previous considerations do not apply when ads2 arises as near-horizon geometry of
higher dimensional black holes with no intermediate ads3 geometry involved. we do not
have a complete explanation of the factor 2 in this case. in our opinion what one needs
in order to nd an explanation of this discrepancy is a complete understanding of the role
played in our derivation by the global topology of ads2. full ads2 has a cylindrical topology
with two disconnected timelike boundaries. this fact plays a crucial role in ref. [8] because
it makes the string theory living on ads2 a theory of open strings. by studying the black
hole solutions of the jt theory we are forced to cut the spacetime on the x = 0 singularity,
so that only one timelike boundary of full ads2 is available. it seems to us that a thorough
understanding of the statistical entropy of 2d black holes will be at hand only when this
point will be fully claried.

perhaps an answer to this question can be found analyzing 2d dilaton gravity models
that admit ads solutions with a constant dilaton.
in this case there is no singularity
and the spacetime can be extended to full ads2. moreover, this is the most interesting
case from the string theoretical point of view, because the near-horizon geometry of most

11

of the higher dimensional extremal black hole solution appearing in string theory behaves
as ads2 c, where c is some compact manifold and is characterised by a constant dilaton.
this case presents some additional diculties if compared with that analysed in this paper.
a constant dilaton makes a black hole interpretation of the solutions very dicult, at least
from the 2d point of view.

6 general models

until now our considerations have been restricted to the jt model (2). however our
results can be easily extended to more general 2d dilaton gravity models that admit solutions
satisfying the boundary conditions (8). let us consider the generic action

a =

1

2 z g d2x hr + 2v ()i ,

(51)

where v () is the dilaton potential. the general solutions of the model are [22]

ds2 = 2

0 (cid:18)j 

2m0

 (cid:19) dt2 + 2

0(cid:18)j 

1

2m0

 (cid:19)

dx2,

 = 0x,

(52)

where j = r v d and m is the mass of the solution. under suitable conditions the solutions

(52) can be interpret as 2d black holes. we are interested in black hole solutions that are
asymptotically ads. more precisely, the solutions must behave asymptotically as in eq. (8).
a simple calculations shows that a sucient condition for this to happen is that the potential
v behaves for    as

(53)

v = 2 + o(cid:16)2(cid:17) .

the calculations of the previous sections can be easily generalized to the class of models
whose potential has the asymptotic behavior (53). because the asymptotic symmetries
depend only on the asymptotic behavior of the metric and of , it turns out that they are
exactly the same as those described by eq. (9). moreover, the models (51) dier from the jt
model (2) only in the form of the potential v . because v does not enter in the calculation of
the central charge c described in sect. 4, it follows that also in this general case c is given by
eq. (42). hence, in the semiclassical regime of large m we nd that the statistical entropy of
the black hole solutions (52) is given by eq. (49). to compare it with the thermodynamical
entropy we use eq. (45). for large m the thermodynamical entropy has the form

s = 4s m

2

+ o(cid:16)m 1(cid:17) .

(54)

the leading term in the expansion exactly matches the result (46) for the jt black hole.

7 the ads2/cft1 correspondence

the meaning of the ads/cft duality in two spacetime dimension is a rather controversial
subject. general arguments suggest that all 2d gravity theories are conformal eld theories.

12

this is not only true for quantum theories of gravity [23] but there is also some evidence that
this could also be true for classical dilaton gravity [24]. strominger argued that quantum
gravity on ads2 is described by a liouville theory, which, owing to the cylindrical topology
of the space, is essentially an open string theory on the strip [8]. as a consequence the
sl(2, r) isometry group of ads2 is enhanced to (half of) the 2d conformal group. this
is essentially the same result we have obtained in the previous sections by analyzing the
asymptotic symmetries of ads2.

these general arguments, together with those presented in sect. 5, suggest that in
the family of the adsd/cftd1 dualities, the d = 2 case is very similar to the d = 3
one, the conformal group being in both instances innite dimensional. the same general
arguments suggest that the cft1 appearing in the ads2 /cft1 correspondence is some
kind of conformal quantum mechanics living in the boundary(ies) of ads2 .

in spite of these similarities with the d = 3 case the ads2 /cft1 correspondence remains
still mysterious and puzzling. one problem is that full ads2 has two timelike boundaries.
the space where the dual conformal theory should live is not a connected manifold. by
considering ads0
2 instead of full ads2 we have only a timelike boundary but we pay the price
of having a singular, not geodesically complete, spacetime. as we have argued in sect. 5,
this is probably the feature that is responsible for the mismatch between thermodynamical
and statistical entropy of 2d black holes. a second feature that is peculiar to the d = 2
case is the complete equivalence of the dieomorphisms and the conformal group in one
dimension. the physical implication of this equivalence is that the usual dierence between
gauge symmetries and symmetries related to conserved charges disappears. for this reason,
as pointed out is sect. 3, the task of nding physical systems that realize the conformal
symmetry becomes very hard to solve.

there is a simple way in which one may avoid the previous problems. one just needs
to assume that the d = 2 case is not fundamental, but intrinsically three-dimensional. if
one accepts this point of view the cft1 should be thought of just as (half) of cft2, in
the way we have explained in sect. 2. evidence that this could be true has been given in
ref. [8], where it has been argued that the in the d = 2 context the general adsd/cftd1
duality becomes a duality between two 2d conformal eld theories. this is certainly true
when ads2 arises as a s1-compactication of ads3 (this is the case analysed in ref.
[8]).
in our approach this implies the identication of the eld  with the radius of s1 (see sect.
5). thus, one has a simple explanation of the intrinsical two-dimensional nature of the
conformal symmetry: the x   boundary corresponds to the spacetime region where the
s1 decompacties.
however, when ads2 is not generated as compactication of ads3 (this the case of the
near-horizon geometry of a variety of higher dimensional black holes in string theory) there
is no reason why ads3 should be more fundamental than ads2 and no reason to consider
cft1 as half of cft2. furthermore, there are some indication that the theory living in the
boundary(ies) of ads2 could be a genuine (though somehow exotic) quantum mechanical
theory. the rst indications comes from dilatonic quantum gravity studies.
it has been
shown that owing to the so-called quantum birkho theorem 2d dilatonic quantum gravity
reduces to quantum mechanics [25]. the quantum mechanical theory arising from dilaton
gravity models admitting ads2 as solution, could be a good candidate for cft1. a second
indication comes from a recent work of gibbons and townsend [26], where it is argued

13

that the large n limit of n-particle superconformal calogero model gives a microscopical
description of the near-horizon limit of extreme reissner-nordstrom black holes.
