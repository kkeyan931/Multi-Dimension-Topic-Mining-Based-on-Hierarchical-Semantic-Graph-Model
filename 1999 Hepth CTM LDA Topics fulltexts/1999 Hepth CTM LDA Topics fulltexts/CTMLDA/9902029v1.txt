abstract

we consider the pure supersymmetric yangmills theories placed on a small
3-dimensional spatial torus with higher orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups.
the problem of constructing the quantum vacuum states is reduced to a pure math-
ematical problem of classifying the at connections on t 3 which is solved in this
paper. in particular, we show that for higher orthogonal so(n ), n  7 and all
exceptional groups the moduli space of at connections involves several distinct iso-
lated components. the total number of vacuum states is given in all cases by the
dual coxeter number of the group which agrees with the result obtained earlier with
the instanton technique.

introduction

it was shown by witten long time ago [1] that, in a pure n = 1 supersymmetric gauge
theory with any simple gauge group, the supersymmetry is not broken spontaneously.
placing the theory in a nite spatial box, the number of supersymmetric vacuum states
[the witten index tr(1)f ] was calculated to be tr(1)f = r + 1 where r is the rank of
the gauge group. this results conforms with other estimates for tr(1)f for unitary and
symplectic groups. it disagrees, however, with the general result 1

tr(1)f = h ,

(1.1)

where h is the dual coxeter number of the group (see e.g. [3], chapt. 6). it coincides with
the casimir t at a in the adjoint representation when a proper normalization is chosen.
for higher orthogonal and exceptional groups. for so(n  7), h = n  2 > r + 1.
also for exceptional groups g2, f4, e6,7,8, the index (1.1) is larger than wittens original
estimate (see table 1).

1which follows e.g. from the counting of gluino zero modes on the instanton background [1, 2]

table 1: vacuum counting for exceptional groups.

this paradox persisting for more than 15 years has been recently resolved by witten
himself in the case of orthogonal groups [4]. he has found a aw in his original arguments
and shown that, for so(n  7), vacuum moduli space is richer than it was thought
before so that the total number of quantum vacua is n  2 in accordance with the result
(1.1). in recent [5], this result was conrmed and generalized on the case of the g2 gauge
group where an extra vacuum state has been found. the aim of our paper is to develop
a general method to construct the moduli space of at connections for any gauge group
including higher exceptional groups f4, e6,7,8. as was anticipated in [5], the moduli space
for these groups involves not one and not two, but many distinct components (up to 10
components for e8). the total number of quantum vacuum states coincides with h in
all cases.

let us rst recall briey wittens original reasoning.

 put our theory on the spatial 3d torus and impose periodic boundary conditions
0 = 0. a classical vacuum is dened as
i (x, y, z) with zero eld strength (a at connection in

on the gauge elds 2. choose the gauge aa
a gauge eld conguration aa
mathematical language).

 for any at periodic connection, we can pick out a particular point in our torus
(0, 0, 0)  (l, 0, 0)  . . . and dene a set of holonomies (wilson loops along non-
trivial cycles of the torus)

0

1 = p exp(iz l
2 = p exp(iz l
3 = p exp(iz l

a1(x, 0, 0)dx) ,
a2(0, y, 0)dy) ,
a3(0, 0, z)dz)

(1.2)

( ai = aa
are invariant under periodic gauge transformations.

i t a where t a are the group generators in a given representation). tr{i}

 a necessary condition for the connection to be at is that all the holonomies (1.2)
commute [i, j] = 0. for a simply connected group with 1(g) = 0, it is also a
sucient condition.

2for unitary groups, one can perform the counting also with t hooft twisted boundary conditions,
but for the orthogonal and exceptional groups where the mismatch in the witten index calculations was
observed this method does not work.

2

 a sucient condition for the group matrices to commute is that their logarithms
belong to a cartan subalgebra of the corresponding lie algebra. for unitary and
simplectic groups, this happens to be also a necessary condition. in other words,
any set of commuting group matrices i with [i, j] = 0 can be presented in the
form

i = exp{ici},

[ci, cj] = 0 .

(1.3)

a at connection with the holonomies i is then just ai = ci/l. the moduli space
of all such connections presents ( up to factorization over the discrete weyl group)
the product tc  tc  tc where tc is the cartan torus whose dimension coincides
with the rank r of the group.

 the wittens original assumption which came out not to be true is that this is
also the case for all other groups. assuming this, witten constructed an eective
bornoppenheimer hamiltonian for the slow variables aa
i where the index a runs
it involves 3r bosonic degrees of freedom and
only over the cartan subalgebra.
their fermionic counterparts a
 is the weyl
spinor). imposing further the condition of the weyl symmetry (a remnant of the
original gauge symmetry) for the eigenstates of this hamiltonian, one nds r + 1
supersymmetric quantum vacuum states: 3

(1.4)

where ab = ab if an orthonormal basis in the cartan subalgebra is chosen.

however, for the groups spin(n) 4 and for all exceptional groups, there are some triples
of the group elements (1, 2, 3) which commute with each other but which cannot be
conjugated (gauge  transformed) to the maximal cartan torus. in the case of spin(7),
there is a unique [up to conjugation i  g1ig, g  spin(7) ] nontrivial triple. it can
be chosen in the form

2

1 = exp(cid:26)
, 2 = exp(cid:26)
, 3 = exp(cid:26)

(12 + 34)(cid:27) = 1234
(12 + 56)(cid:27) = 1256
(13 + 57)(cid:27) = 1357 .

2

(1.5)

obviously, [i, j] = 0. on the other hand, as we will shortly be convinced, the triple
(1.5) cannot be conjugated to the maximal torus. this isolated triple corresponds to

3see appendix b for a rigourous proof.
4spin(n ) is the simply connected universal covering of so(n ).

it is represented by the matrices
exp{} where  are the gammamatrices of the corresponding dimension forming the cliord
algebra  +   = 2,  = 1, . . . , n . we have already mentioned and will see later that the
condition 1(g) = 0 is very important in the whole analysis. it what follows, we will discuss mostly the
groups spin(n) rather than their orthogonal counterparts.

an isolated at connection on t 3 which brings about the extra quantum vacuum state.
thereby,

tr(1)f = rspin(7) + 1 + 1 = 5 = h

spin(7) .

for spin(8) and g2, there is also only one extra isolated triple and one extra vacuum
state. for spin(n  9), there is a family of such triples with each element lying on the
small cartan torus of spin(n  7). this brings about rspin(n 7) + 1 extra vacuum
states. the total counting is

tr(1)f = rspin(n ) + 1 + rspin(n 7) + 1 = n  2 = h

spin(n ) .

before proceeding further, let us make a simple remark. for a group which is not
simply connected, there are always non-trivial commuting pairs of the elements which
cannot be conjugated on the maximal torus. consider for example so(3). the elements
diag(-1, -1, 1) and diag(1, -1, -1) obviously commute, but their logarithms proportional to
the generators of the correponding rotations  t1 and  t3 do not. in the covering su(2)
group, the corresponding elements i1 and i3 anticommute. such a pair of the elements
of su(2) is usually called the heisenberg pair. generally, we will call the heisenberg pair
a pair of the elements b, c which satisfy the relations

bc = zcb

(1.6)

where z is the element of the center of the group. an example of the heisenberg pair for
su(3) with z = e2i/3i is

b = 


0

1
0 e2i/3
0

0

0
0

e2i/3




, c = 


0 0 1
1 0 0
0 1 0

.




(1.7)

a permutation of b and c gives the pair with z = e2i/3i. as we will prove later,
all heisenberg pairs in su(3) are equivalent by conjugation to (1.7) or its permutation.
heisenberg pairs will play the central role in the whole analysis.

for a simply connected group, a pair of commuting elements can always be conjugated
to the maximal torus. that follows from the fact that one element can always be put
on the torus and from the so called botts theorem: the centralizer 5 of any element in a
simply connected group is always connected. we rst put g on the torus of g and then
conjugate h on the torus of the centralizer which coincides with the large torus (obviously,
once g is put on the torus, any element of the torus belongs to the centralizer) .

consider an arbitrary simply connected group g. for a commuting triple of elements
g1,2,3, the elements g2, g3 belong to the centralizer gg1 of g1. now if gg1 presents a product
of a simply connected group and some number of u(1) factors as is usually the case (e.g.
the centralizer of an element of su(3) can be su(3), su(2)  u(1) or [u(1)]2 ), one can
put g2 and g3 on the torus of gg1 and hence the whole triple on the torus of g. but if gg1
involves a factor whose fundamental groups is nite, one cannot do it in a general case.

5the centralizer of the element g of the group g is dened as a subgroup of g involving all elements

h which commute with g.

figure 1: dynkin diagram for spin(7) with its dynkin labels.

one can prove (we will do it later) that the centralizer of any element of a unitary or a
simplectic group is always simply connected up to some number of u(1) factors and hence
these groups do not admit non-trivial triples. a central statement is that it is not so for
higher orthogonal and exceptional groups. and this is the origin of non-trivial triples.

look again at the triple (1.5). the element 1 commutes with 6 generators 12, . . .
of spin(4) acting on the subspace (1234) and with 3 generators of spin(3) acting on the
subspace (567). hence, the centralizer of 1 seems to be spin(4)  spin(3). this is not,
however, quite so: the whole product spin(4)  spin(3) is not a subgroup of spin(7).
indeed, both spin(4) and spin(3) have non-trivial center. the center of spin(3)  su(2)
is z2, a non-trivial center element corresponding to rotation by 2 in, say, (56) - plane.
the center of spin(4)  su(2)su(2) is z2 z2. it has a diagonal element presenting
the product of nontrivial center elements in each su(2) factor:

z = exp(cid:26)

2

(12  34)(cid:27) exp(cid:26)

2

(12 + 34)(cid:27) = exp {12} .

note now that exp {12} = exp {56} = 1 in the full spin(7) group. hence the true
centralizer of 1 is [spin(4)  spin(3)]/z2  [su(2)]3/z2 where the factorization is done
over the common center of spin(3) and of each su(2) factor in spin(4). the matrices 2
and 3 correspond to the elements (i3, i3, i3) and (i2, i2, i2) in [su(2)]3, i.e. they
form a heisenberg pair in each su(2) factor. they still commute in the centralizer and in
spin(7) exactly because the factorization over the common center should be done. the
elements 2, 3 cannot be conjugated on the maximal torus in the centralizer and hence
the whole triple (1.5) cannot be conjugated on the maximal torus in spin(7).

what is the underlying reason for the fact that non-trivial triples exist in spin(7),
in higher spin(n) and in exceptional groups, but do not exist in unitary and simplectic
groups ? to understand it, one has to consider the dynkin diagram for the simple roots
of the corresponding algebras.

the several following paragraphs are addressed for the reader who is not an expert in
the compact lie group theory with a hope to give him a feeling what is going on here.
an expert can skip it and continue reading from the beginning of the next section.

the dynkin diagram for spin(7) is depicted in fig. 1 . , , and  are the simple
roots. the term root means that the corresponding generators t,, are eigenvectors

5

of the (complex) lie algebra of spin(7) with respect to its cartan subalgebra. in other
words, they satisfy the relations

[ei, t] = it,

[ei, t] = it,

[ei, t] = it ,

(1.8)

where ei is the normalized orthogonal basis in the cartan subalgebra. a convenient choice
is e1 = t12, e2 = t34, e3 = t56 where tij = iij/2 are the generators of spin(7). in that
case

t =

1
2

[t13 + t24  i(t23 + t41)] , t =

1
2

[t35 + t46  i(t45 + t63)]

t = t57  it67 ,

(1.9)

[t,, multiplied by any factor would also satisfy the commutation relations (1.8), but
the normalization chosen in eq.(1.9) is the most convenient one]. the root vectors are
i = (1, 1, 0), i = (0, 1, 1) and i = (0, 0, 1). one can dene the scalar product
h., .i in a natural way. the squares of the lengths of the roots are equal to 2 for , 
and to 1 for . thereby,  is a short root and it is denoted with the small circle. a
single line between the roots ,  means that h, i = 1 so that the angle between

these roots , = arccos[h, i/qh, ih, i] = 120o. the double line between  and 

means that , = 135o. the absence of the line between  and  means that these roots
are orthogonal and the corresponding generators in the lie algebra commute. any other
positive 6 root of the algebra can be presented as a linear combination of the simple roots
a + a + a with positive integer a,,. the sum a + a + a is called the weight
of the root. the root with the highest weight  =  + 2 + 2 [the corresponding coroot
 is t12 + t34] plays a special role. it (or rather the corresponding negative root  )
is denoted by the dashed circle in fig. 1. the dynkin labels ai = (1, 2, 2) seen on the
diagram are just the coecients of the expansion of the highest root via the simple roots.
it is convenient to ascribe the label 1 for the highest root. we see that  has the length
2, is orthogonal to  and , and form the angle 120o with the root .

we will prove later that whenever the algebra involve a simple root with the property
a
i = aihi, ii/2 > 1, an element of the group exist whose centralizer is not simply
connected. and if not, then not. that is why such exceptional elements are absent for
unitary and simplectic groups where a
 = 1 and a

i = 1 for all simple roots.
 = 2. thereby, the element with a non-trivial

centralizer is associated with the root . its explicit form is

g = exp{i} ,

where  is the fundamental coweight  the element of the cartan algebra satisfying the
indeed, in our case,  =  and g
property [, t] = [, t] = 0,
6 for any such root +, there is also a negative root  = +. the commutator [t, t] lies in
the cartan subalgebra. in the following, we will need also the notion of coroot which is dened as the
element  of the cartan subalgebra proportional to [with the normalization choice as in eq.(1.9), just
equal to] [t, t] such that [, t] = 2t. in other words, the generators , t form an su(2)
subalgebra in the same way as the matrices 3,  do. for any coroot , the property exp{2i} = 1
holds.

table 2: dynkin diagrams and dynkin labels for all compact lie groups.

coincides with 1 in eq. (1.5). the centralizer of g has been constructed explicitly above,
but it can also be calculated on the basis of the dynkin diagram. obviously, g commutes
with the generators corresponding to the simple roots , . but it also commutes with
the generator t corresponding to the highest root . that follows from the fact that
[, t] = 2t. thereby, the centralizer of g is formed by the commuting generators
t, t, t and is hence [su(2)]3. the fact that this product has to be factorized over the
common center z2 is not seen right away now, but we have seen it explicitly for spin(7)
and it will be proven in a general manner in the next section.

consider now higher groups spin(n  9). as is seen from table 2, the corresponding
i = 2. each element j = exp{ij} has a

dynkin diagrams involve several nodes with a
non-trivial centralizer. moreover, in this case we have a family of the elements

where si are some real numbers with 2pi si = 1 and the sum runs over all the nodes

if all si are nonzero, the element (1.11) commutes with two (for odd

n) and three (for even n) simple roots with a

i = 2.

this general case, the centralizer of the element (1.11) is [su(2)]3/z2  [u(1)]r3 for
n = 2r + 1 and [su(2)]4/z2  [u(1)]r4 for n = 2r. the family (1.11) spans a d
 dimensional torus in spin(n) (d = r  3 or r  4 depending on whether n is odd
or even.
it coincides with the cartan torus of the subgroup spin(n  7) as is not
dicult to see when substituting the explicit expressions for the fundamental weights:
1 = i(12 + 34)/2, 2 = i(12 + 34 + 56)/2, etc.

we will see later that one can restrict all si in eq. (1.11) to be positive and the elements
(1.11) involving some negative si can be reduced by conjugation to the same canonical
form (1.11) with all si positive. thereby, the moduli space of exceptional elements (the
space of exceptional gauge orbits) presents the torus t d factorized over the action of a
certain discrete group which plays the role of the weyl group for this small torus. for
each such element (including also the case when some of si vanish), the moduli space of
nonequivalent heisenberg pairs in the centralizer presents a subset of t d  t d. thereby,
the moduli space of all nonequivalent triples lies in t d  t d  t d in agreement with the
previous results.

i > 1. for example, g2 involves only one such node with a

as is seen from the table 2, the exceptional groups also involve a number of nodes
with a
i = 2 which gives rise to
only one non-trivial isolated triple. other exceptional groups involve several such nodes,
and the moduli space is somewhat more complicated but, as we will see, it can be rather
easily constructed just by the form of the corresponding dynkin diagram.

the three following sections present the hard core of the paper. in the next section,
after some preliminary remarks, we establish the families of the exceptional elements
whose centralizer is not simply connected. the structure of the heisenberg pairs in
these centralizers is the subject of sect. 3. in sect. 4 we construct the moduli space
of all commuting triples.
in sect. 5 we recapitulate the results and illustrate them
by some explicit calculations. the nal counting of the quantum vacuum states in the
supersymmetric yangmills theories is also done.

2 conjugacy classes and centralizers in compact lie

groups.

let g be a compact lie group and let lie g be its lie algebra. fix a g  invariant
symmetric positive denite bilinear form h., .i on i lie g. choose a maximal torus t in
g and let h = i lie t . the bilinear form h., .i denes an isomorphism of real vector
spaces  : h  h given by h  (h) : h  (h) : (h)(h) = hh, hi, h, h  h,
and hence a bilinear form h., .i on h. given a non-zero vector   h, the vector  =
21()/h, i  h is independent of the choice of h., .i.

let   h be the set of (non-zero) roots of lie g and let  = {|  }  h
be the set of coroots. denote by q(g) and q(g) the z - span of the sets  and 
respectively. these are called the root and coroot lattices and actually depend only on
lie g. introduce the coweight lattice

p (g) = {h  h|e2ih = 1} .

(2.1)

this lattice contains the lattice q(g). it is well known that if g is a connected compact

lie group, then its fundamental group is given by the following formula

1(g) = p (g)/q(g) .

(2.2)

suppose now that g is a connected simply connected (almost) simple compact lie
group of rank r. choose a set of simple roots  = {1, . . . , r}  , then  =

called simply laced (or 1laced), g of type b  c  f is called 2laced and the group g2
is 3laced. if j is a long root, one has: a
j = aj (that happens for all j in the a  d  e
cases). if j is a short root, one has a
0 = a0 = 1. the set of
vectors {0, 1, . . . , r} along with the integers aj are depicted by the extended dynkin
diagrams d(g) which are listed in table 2.

if g  g is conjugate to ~s, the real numbers s0, . . . , sr are called

proof of theorem 1. statement a) is well known.

in this form for nite order

of any element of g is usually attributed to bott (see e.g. [6], 3). a proof of the second
part of b) can also be found in [3], chapter 8.

finally, the proof of c) is based on the formula (2.2).

if g1 is a subgroup of g

containing t , then p (g1) = p (g) and q(g1)  q(g), hence

the proof of c) now is completed by the following simple lemma.

1(g1) = q(g)/q(g1)

lemma 1. let q = r

i=1 aii
be a non-zero element of q. let i be a subset of {0, 1, . . . , r} and let qi = ii zi.
then the group q/qi is isomorphic to a direct product of zr#i and a cyclic group of
order gcd{ai|i / i}.

i=1zi be a free abelian group of rank r and let 0 = pr

proof. if 0 / i, the lemma is obvious.

if 0  i, we may choose a basis of qi of
the form 0, i1, i2, . . . where i1, i2, . . .  1. after reordering of the set {1, . . . , r}, the
matrix expressing this basis in terms of the basis of q takes the form

m =

it follows that all elementary divisors of m are a := gcd{as+1, . . . ar}, 1, . . . , 1. hence the
maximal nite subgroup of q/qi is a cyclic group of order a.

remark. recall that the element g  g is called nonadexceptional [7] if it can
be written in the form g = e2i, where (ad g)x = x, i [, x] = 0 (, x  i lie g).
it was shown in ref.[7] that g is nonadexceptional i the set of integers ai for which
the coordinates si of g are nonzero are relatively prime. it follows from our theorem
1c that, for a nonadexceptional g, 1(gg) is a free abelian group (or, equivalently, the
semisimple part of gg is simply connected) and that for a simply laced g the converse
holds as well.

3 heisenberg pairs in compact lie groups.

given a central element z in a compact lie group g, a heisenberg pair with center z is a
pair of elements b, c  g satisfying the commutation relation (1.6). if in addition z has
order m, and one has

bm = cm = ( 1

zm/2

if m is odd

if m is even

(3.1)

10

then (b, c) is called a standard heisenberg pair with center z. a heisenberg pair (b, c) is
called lowest dimensional if its orbit g  (b, c) under conjugation has minimal dimension
(among heisenberg pairs with center z).

example 1. let (b, c) be an irreducible heisenberg pair in u(n) (i.e.

there are
no nontrivial subspace invariant with respect to b and c ). then z = in where  is a
primitive m-th root of 1. let v1 be an eigenvector for b: bv1 = v1, and let vj+1 = cj+1v1,
j = 1, . . . , n  1. since the pair (b, c) is irreducible, the vectors vj , j = 1, . . . , n form a
basis of cn . due to (1.6), we have

bvj = j1vj,

j = 1, . . . , n .

(3.2)

since, due to (1.6), c permutes cyclically the eigenspaces of b, it follows from irreducibility
of the pair (b, c) that all eigenspaces of b are 1 - dimensional. hence, we have

cvj = vj+1,
cvn = v1 .

j = 1, . . . , n  1

since cn v1 is a multiple of v1, we get by (1.6) that n = 1. therefore

n = m .

(3.3)

(3.4)

thus, all irreducible heisenberg pairs (b, c) in u(n) with center z = in , where  is a
primitive m-th root of 1, are given up to conjugation by (3.2)  (3.4), where  and  are
arbitrary constants of modulus 1.

if (b, c) is a standard irreducible heisenberg pair in u(m) with center i,  being a

primitive m-th root of 1, then clearly

m =  = (1)m+1 .

(3.5)

it follows that there exists a unique up to conjugation such pair and it lies in su(m).
[for m = 2, the matrices (3.2), (3.3) with the condition (3.5) are reduced to i3, i2
and, for m = 3,  = e2i/3, they coincide with (1.7).]

due to complete reducibility, we obtain that there exists in u(n) a heisenberg pair
with center z = in ,  being a primitive m-th root of 1, i m divides n and that any
such pair is conjugate to a direct sum of n/m such irreducible pairs. moreover, in this
case there exists a unique up to conjugation standard heisenberg pair, say (b, c), which
is a direct sum of irreducible such pairs, and any heisenberg pair in u(n) or su(n) is
obtained by multiplying (b, c) by a direct sum of matrices iim, i = 1, . . . , n/m, where
|i| = 1 and, in the su(n) case, qi m

note that the centralizer of the standard heisenberg pair (b, c) is isomorphic to the
direct product of hzi and su(n/m) (here and further hzi denotes the cyclic group gen-
erated by z). it is also clear that this is a lowest dimensional heisenberg pair with center
in , where  is a primitive m-th root of 1.

i = 1.

proposition 1. let g be as in theorem 1, let z be a central element of g and let
(b, c) be a heisenberg pair with center z. let t 0 be a maximal torus in the centralizer of
this pair in g. then any heisenberg pair can be conjugated to a heisenberg pair of the
form (bt, ct), where t, t  t 0.

11

proof. consider the group gb,hzi = {x  g|x1bx  bhzi}. its connected components
are zgb, where z  hzi. the connected component containing c is zgb; it consists of
all c such that (b, c) is a heisenberg pair with center z. the element c acts on gb,hzi by
conjugation preserving the component zgb. recall that, by [8], all conjugacy classes in a
compact lie group k contained in a connected component of its element g intersect the
set gt 0, where t 0 is a maximal torus in the centralizer of g in k. hence, all conjugacy
classes of the group gb,hzi contained in zgb intersect the set ct 0.

let (b, c) be a heisenberg pair with center z. by above, we may assume that c =
ct, t  t 0. but b  gct,hzi, and arguing as above we see that b is conjugated in the
group gct,hzi by the conjugation action of gct into the set bt 0.

now we will construct standard heisenberg pairs (bm, cm) in the universal covers of
semisimple parts of centralizers of exceptional elements. this will provide us with a
collection of commuting pairs (bm, cm) in the centralizers themselves.

m is a torus of dimension rm, we have

m is a connected

dim t (i)

m = dim g + 2rm .

(b) rank of the centralizer of a triple from t (i)
(c) the sum over all components of t of the numbers rm + 1 is equal to h.
proof. let (a, b, c) be a triple of commuting elements in g. if a is not exceptional,
then by theorem 1c, 1(ga) is a free abelian group, hence ga is a direct product of a
torus t1  t and the semisimple part which is a connected simply connected group. but
then the commuting pair (b, c)  ga can be conjugated to t in ga (since the centralizer
of b in ga is connected, the element c can be conjugated in ga  gb to t ). thus, in this
case (a, b, c) is a trivial triple (i.e. it can be conjugated to t ).

let now a be m  exceptional for m  2. we may assume that a  t 1

(m) (see theorem
1a). then the group ga is a product of one of the groups q(m) (see theorem 2) and a torus,
say t1. let ga = t1  q(m) so that ga = ga/z(m) and let b, c denote some preimages of
(b, c)  ga in ga. if bc = cb, then the pair (b, c) can be conjugated in ga to the preimage
of t and the triple (a, b, c) is trivial. finally, if bc = zcb for a non-trivial element z = z(i)
d
of z(m) of order d, where d divides m, then by theorem 2, the pair (b, c) can be conjugated
in ga to the family b(i)
(d). it is also clear that, for all commuting triples from a
connected component, z is the same and that t s

proof of (a). (b) follows from theorem 2.

this latter fact has been established by theorem 3c. another way to understand it is
the following. we have seen that the extra components mk are associated with the nodes
with a
i > 1 on the dynkin diagrams. just by construction, the sum (5.2) coincides with
6 = 6 on the
dynkin diagram for e8. it gives rise to two dierent isolated triples with m = 6 (and,
correspondingly, to two dierent quantum states). together with two nodes with a
i = 3, it
gives rize to the component mk based on the torus t 2 ( and if the node i0 were not present
in the superposition, the dimension of the torus would be one unit less, and we would
have not 3, but just 2 vacuum states ). finally, together with the nodes with a
i = 2, 4,
it forms the torus t 4. as we have here m = 3, there are two dierent components mk
involving such torus and, correspondingly, two extra vacuum states brought about by the
node 6. all together, this node gives rise to 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 = a
6  1 extra states. the
same counting works for all other nodes.

i) there is a root 3 with a

3 = 3. according to theorem 1, there is only
one associated element g = exp{(2i/3) 3}. the centralizer of this element is
su(3)su(3) (the dynkin diagram for the centralizer is obtained from the extended
dynkin diagram of f4 by removing the node 3) factorized over the common center
z3. 8 z3 has two non-trivial elements and, correspondingly, there are two dierent
non-trivial heisenberg pairs in su(3) : the pair in eq. (1.7) and its permutation.
we have proven earlier [see the remark after eq.(3.5)] that all other heisenberg
pairs can be reduced to (1.7) by conjugation. from this, we have two dierent
isolated triples {i} and two dierent corresponding quantum vacuum states. note
that, in this case, the second triple is obtained from the rst one just by reordering
2  3, but they are still two dierent triples from our viewpoint. they describe
two dierent at connections on t 3 which cannot reduced one to another by gauge
transformation.
ii) there are two nodes (the long root 2 and the short root 4) with a

centralizer of g = exp{2i(s22 +s44)}, 2s2 +4s4 = 1, is non-trivial. if s2, s4 6= 0,
it is [su(2)]3/z2u(1). correspondingly, there is a family t 1t 1t 1 of non-trivial
commuting triples which gives rise to two extra quantum vacua.

to g by conjugation. this is guaranteed by theorem 1a.

there are two 4  order elements in the center: z = (ii4, ii4, i2). for each such
element, there is unique up to conjugation heisenberg pair (b, c) in su(4) the
elements (b, b, 1) and (c, c, 1) in the centralizer commute. correspondingly, we
have two dierent isolated triples and two new vacua.

ii) the centralizer (5.3) admits also heisenberg pairs based on the 2  order element
of z4. there are many such pairs forming the su(2)  su(2) family [recall that the
centralizer of a heisenberg pair in su(n) based on the central element of order m
is su(n/m) if m divides n ]. the 3 + 3  parametric family of triples following
from that is actually a subset of a larger t 3  t 3  t 3 family based on a generic
exceptional element which is formed by the node 4 together with three other nodes

from this, we obtain 4 extra quantum vacua.

exp{i/3}cb. the corresponding commuting elements in the centralizer are (b, 1, 1)
and (c, 1, 1). we have two isolated triples and two extra vacua. besides, z6 has 2
elements of order 3 and an element of order 2. as was also the case for e7, heisenberg
pairs associated with that are absorbed in the families iii) and iv) below, formed
by a combination of several nodes.

ii) the element exp{2i/5 5} associated with the node with ai = 5 has the cen-

ingly: 4 isolated triples and 4 extra vacua.
iii) there are two distinct components t 2  t 2  t 2 formed by the nodes 6 and two
nodes 3, each of them giving 3 vacua.
iv) the component t 4  t 4  t 4 formed by the nodes 6, two nodes 4 and two nodes

appendix a: heisenberg pairs in all connected simply
connected compact lie groups.

here is a general way to construct a heisenberg pair (b, c) with center z in a simply
connected simple compact lie group g (for semisimple g we just take the product of the
(bi, ci) over all simple factors gi).

recall that all nontrivial central elements of g are of the form e2ij where j =
1, . . . , r is such that aj = 1. pick such a j and consider the set of roots {0, 1, . . . , r}\j.
this is another set of simple roots, hence there exists a unique element wj of the weyl
group w of g which transforms it to the set 1, . . . , r, hence wjj = 0. this gives us
a canonical embedding of the center of g in w : e2ij  wj, and, at the same time, in
the group of symmetries of the extended dynkin diagram d(g).

let z = e2ij be a central element of g of order m  2. let ij = hwji  0 be the
subset of the set of nodes of d(g) obtained by the action of the group hwji on the node
0 (as = 1 for all nodes from ij).

let

b = ~s

(a.1)

as in eq.
(2.4), where ~s is dened by si = 1 if i  ij and si = 0 otherwise. write
wj = r1    rk as a shortest product of reections with respect to roots 1, . . . , k and
let

c = q1    qk ,

(a.2)

where qt is the pauli matrix i2 in the su(2) corresponding to the root it.

theorem a1. let g be as in theorem 1 and let z = e2ij be a central element of

g of order m  2.

(a) the pair (b, c) given by (a.1) and (a.2) is a heisenberg pair with center z.
(b) any heisenberg pair with center z in g can be conjugated to a heisenberg pair of
the form (bt, ct), where (b, c) is given by (a.1) and (a.2) and t, t lie in a xed maximal
torus of k.

(c) the centralizer of a lowest dimensional heisenberg pair of g with center z is the

direct product of hzi and a connected subgroup k listed in table 7.

proof. it is easy to see that (b, c) is a heisenberg pair with center z since c1bc = ewj ,

where  = (2i/m)psij\0 s, hence bc = ewjcb, and one can check that ewj  = z.

(b) follows from proposition 1. finally, the centralizer of b in g is obtained by removing
all nodes j with aj = 1 from d(g). multiplying, if necessary, c by an element from a
maximal torus from the centralizer of (b, c), we may assume that c induces a diagram
automorphism of gb for which the xed point sets are wellknown (see [3], chapter 8).
this proves (c).

remark. theorem a1 gives a classication of all up to conjugacy commuting pairs in
connected compact (not necessarily simply connected) lie groups g. in particular, this
theorem shows that connected components of the set of pairs of commuting elements of g
are in one-to-one correspondence with elements of the maximal nite subgroup of 1(g).

using table 5, one immediately gets the list of centralizers of m - exceptional triples
(a, b, c), where a = exp{2ij/aj}, m = aj and (b, c) is the lowest dimensional pair in
ga. for all exceptional groups they are listed in table 6.

in the case of spin(n) groups, these centralizers are as follows :

n = 2r + 1 gives gk = spin(2k  1)  spin(2r  2k  3), k = 1, . . . , r  2 and
n = 2r gives gk = spin(2k  1)  spin(2r  2k  3), k = 1, . . . , r  3 ,

spin(n  7) as was noticed before in [4, 5]. however, for n = 2r + 1, the maximal
centralizer is spin(n  6). an example of the corresponding nontrivial triple for spin(9)
is (1234, 125, 136). it can be embedded in p in(6), but not in spin(6).

appendix b: grassmann invariants of weyl groups.

let v = i lie t be the euclidean r  dimensional vector space on which the weyl group
w acts via the reection representation. we shall assume in this section that the group
g is (almost) simple, hence the representation of w in v is irreducible. the group w
acts diagonally on v  v and this action induces an action on the grassmann algebra

 = (v  v ) .

let  = pi e(1)

or 2, is the same orthonormal basis in both copies of v . then j,
linearly independent w  invariant elements of .

theorem b1. elements j, j = 0, . . . , r, form a basis of the space w of w 

invariants in .

proof. it is a simple and wellknown fact that, for any representation of a nite group
 in a nitedimensional vector space u, the dimension of the space of invariants of  in

the grassmann algebra (u) over u is given by the formula

dim (u) =

1

# xg

det(1 + g) .

(b.1)

applying this to  = w , u = v  v , we see that theorem b1 is equivalent to the
following formula:

[pw(1)]2 = (r + 1) #w ,

(b.2)

xww

where pw(x) stands for the characteristic polynomial det(x  w) of w acting on v . for-
tunately, there is in ref.
[9] a complete table of characteristic polynomials for all weyl
groups which allows one to check (b.2) in all cases. unfortunately, we do not know a
conceptial proof of (b.2).

remark. in fact, one has a renement of (b.1):

dim j(u)xj =

xj0

1

# xg

det(x + g) .

(b.3)

hence, theorem b1 is equivalent to a renement of (b.2):

1 + x2 + x4 + . . . + x2r =

#w xww

[det(x + g)]2 .

(b.4)

corollary. the dimension of the space of the invariants of the group w(m) on the
grassmann algebra over i lie t(m)  i lie t(m) is rm + 1.

proof. in order to apply theorem 4, we need to show that w(m) contains an irreducible
nite reection group. to show this, remark that if t(m) is a maximal torus of a compact
subgroup, say k, of g, then w(m) contains the weyl group of k. from the list of groups
given in table 6, we conclude that w(m) contains the subgroup listed in the last column
of table 4.

note added. after this work has been completed, we got acquainted with very recent
paper [10] where an explicit construction of the set of non-trivial triples with m = 2 for all
exceptional group has been done and the results for m = 3, 4, 5, 6 were announced. the
results agree with ours. the question of completeness of this classication was not studied,
however, in that paper. the theorems proven here guarantee that, indeed, all non-trivial
triples lie in one of the families discussed above and the total number of quantum states
always coincides, indeed, with the dual coxeter number of the group.
