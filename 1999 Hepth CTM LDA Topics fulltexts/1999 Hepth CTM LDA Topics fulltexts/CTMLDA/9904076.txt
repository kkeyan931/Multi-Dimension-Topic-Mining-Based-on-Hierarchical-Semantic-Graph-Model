(in respect, since number free indices term always same, dene lower order terms containing terms fewer (sp.sq) vice versa higher order terms.) given this, impose rule, (sp.sq) (sp.sq) + (sp.sq), (109) whenever < < (assuming < < ), dene canonical form products (sp.sq) . then, use relations (sp.sq)(sr.st) (sp.sq)(sr.st) (sp.sq.sr.st), (110) p < q, r < t, c < b (sp.sq) 6= (sr.st), (sp.sq)(sp.sq) (sp.sq)(sp.sq) (sp.sq.sp.sq), (111) < < , show product (sp.sq) tensors indices totally ordered. again, extra terms right hand side lower order (sp.sq) therefore ordered without generating terms higher order (see eq.
