abstract

the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the dlcq method is investigated in detail using a yukawa-
like model closely related to the nambu-jona-lasinio model. by classically solving three constraints
characteristic of the light-front formalism, we show that the chiral transformation dened on the light
front is equivalent to the usual one. a quantum analysis demonstrates that a nonperturbative mean-
eld solution to the zero-mode constraint for a scalar boson  can develop a nonzero condensate
n h i 6= 0 while a perturbative solution cannot. this description is due to our identication
hi =  
of the zero-mode constraint with the gap equation. the mean-eld calculation claries unusual
chiral transformation properties of fermionic eld, which resolves the seemingly inconsistency between
5 |0i = 0 and nonzero condensation h i 6= 0. we also
the triviality of the null-plane charge qlf
calculate masses of scalar and pseudoscalar bosons for both symmetric and broken phases.

1 introduction

chiral symmetry breaking is undoubtedly one of the most important concepts for understanding
hadron physics in the low energy region [1]. the smallness of  and k masses is beautifully
explained if one identies them with the nambu-goldstone (ng) bosons associated with the
chiral symmetry breaking. an important aspect of this phenomenon is the dynamical formation
of ng bosons as bound states of quarks and gluons in the strong coupling region. however,
its complete demonstration in qcd is not reached yet because of the diculties in describing
bound states in a nonperturbative and relativistic manner. instead, many people have been
investigating much simpler eective models of qcd. among them, the nambu-jona-lasinio
(njl) model [2] is the most deeply and thoroughly understood. the njl model is a 3+1
dimensional four-fermi theory and reproduces various properties of hadrons concerning the
chiral symmetry breaking despite some undesirable features such as nonrenormalizability and
lack of connement [3]. nowadays the model plays a role of laboratory in which we can test
new ideas proposed for nonperturbative study of low energy qcd. therefore the njl model is
the most appropriate in which we can check whether the light-front (lf) quantization can be
applied to the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. the lf quantization is a newly revamped
nonperturbative method for solving relativistic bound states in quantum eld theory [4].

let us explain why the chiral symmetry breaking becomes a special issue in the lf for-
malism. the reason is twofold: the rst is the apparent contradiction between the nontrivial
vacuum and the lf trivial vacuum, and the second is the peculiarity of lf chiral transfor-
mation. to resolve these problems is our primary purpose in the present paper. one of the
remarkable merits of the lf quantization is that the fock vacuum dened by a free theory is
also the vacuum of the full theory. many technical advantages such as exact fock state expan-
sion arise from this fact. on the contrary, the conventional formulation says that the chiral
symmetry breaking is essentially a physics of nding another vacuum that breaks the chiral
symmetry but is energetically favored. such vacuum physics is thought to be very important
for understanding nonperturbative phenomena in low energy region. therefore to apply the lf
formalism to qcd necessarily entails a problem how to realize such vacuum physics within
a framework with a trivial vacuum. for the purpose of understanding this problem, there are
considerable eorts [5] to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a simple scalar model
(4
1+1). they succeeded in obtaining the critical coupling which is consistent with the conven-
tional calculations. the key was to solve a constraint equation for the longitudinal zero mode
(zero-mode constraint) which appears in the dlcq (discretized light-cone quantization)
method [6]. a nonzero condensate is realized as a nonperturbative solution of the zero-mode
constraint.

compared with such extensive studies, only little is known about the dynamical symmetry
breaking in fermionic systems. especially there have been only few attempts about the njl
model on the lf [7, 8, 9, 10]. at rst glance, it seems not possible to follow the same route as
in the scalar models because we do not have bosonic elds as fundamental degrees of freedom
in the njl model. however, we can apply the same idea to the dynamical symmetry breaking
if one introduces bosonic auxiliary elds to the fermion bilinears and raises them to dynamical
variables by adding their kinetic terms. of course the original fermionic model is reproduced
as an innitely heavy mass limit of the bosonic elds. according to this idea, we succeeded in
describing the dynamical symmetry breaking (discrete chiral symmetry) in the 1+1 dimensional
four fermi theory (the gross-neveu model) [11]. the present paper is a generalization of this
preliminary work which discussed only discrete chiral symmetry. we consider the yukawa-like

2

model with continuous chiral symmetry, which is obtained from the njl model using the above
technique. we work within the dlcq method so that we can formulate the problem from the
viewpoint of the zero-mode constraints. it should be commented however that it is possible to
discuss the dynamical symmetry breaking even without introducing auxiliary elds. in ref. [8],
one of the authors insisted the importance of the fermionic constraint which is again unique
to the lf formulation and has very complicated structure due to the four-fermi interaction.
(another merit of including scalar elds is a quite simplication of the fermionic constraint.)
more detailed analysis in this direction will be reported in the next paper [12].

one more point to be discussed is the unusual behavior of chiral transformation on the
lf. in the lf formulation, a half degree of freedom of the fermion is a dependent variable
to be represented by other independent variables. therefore, chiral transformation should be
imposed only on the independent component of the fermion [13]. it is not clear in interacting
models whether the lf chiral transformation is equivalent to the usual one or not.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section, we dene the yukawa-like model
which is closely related to the njl model and introduce our framework, the dlcq method. the
classical aspects of the model is discussed in sec. 3. here, we see that there are three constraints
(i.e. two zero-mode constraints and one fermionic constraint). we also show peculiarity of
the lf chiral transformation and explicitly give the null-plane chiral charge qlf
5 . quantum
analysis, which is the main part of this paper, is developed in sections 4 and 5. in sec. 4, we
demonstrate that perturbative and nonperturbative treatments of the solution to the constraints
give dierent description of the model. in sec. 5, we discuss some physics consequences of the
nonperturbative analysis. the last section is devoted to conclusion and discussions. our
conventions are summarized in appendix.

2 the model

here we introduce the model we consider and summarize the standard knowledge on the chiral
symmetry breaking in the conventional equal-time formulation. we also dene our setup of the
problem following the dlcq method.

2.1 the denition of the model

the njl model was rst introduced as the simplest 3 + 1 dimensional example which exhibits
the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking [2]. in its original form there were two avors, but a
one avor model

lnjl = a(i/  m)a +

+(cid:16) ai5a(cid:17)2(cid:21)



2n (cid:20)(cid:16) aa(cid:17)2

also breaks the chiral symmetry which exists in the massless case m = 0. we frequently give
an additional internal structure to the fermion independently of the avor, and treat an n-
component spinor a in order to clarify the validity of approximation we use. from now on,
summation over a = 1, . . . , n is always implied. since this model is not renormalizable, we
must specify a regularization scheme such as a cuto to uniquely determine the model and to
obtain nite results.

in this paper, we discuss more general model with yukawa interactions:

l = a(i/  m)a +

n
22 ( + )

(2.1)
where  () is a scalar (pseudoscalar) boson with mass / and  is a dimensionless param-
eter. if one takes innitely heavy mass limit for scalars   , the dynamical scalars become
auxiliary elds  =  
in order to contrast with our lf calculation, let us briey comment on the usual story of
chiral symmetry breaking in the njl model [2]. when m = 0, both of the lagrangian densities
are invariant under the chiral transformation:

i5 and the model goes back to the njl model.

it should be reminded that this transformation is, of course, imposed on all the elds, which is,
however, not the case in the lf formalism. this point will be discussed later in more detail. the
usual story is as follows: the chiral symmetry breaks down spontaneously in a quantum level
due to nonzero fermion condensate h i 6= 0. the most straightforward demonstration will
be the mean eld approximation with the concept of self-consistency. if one has n-component
fermion, we can justify the mean eld approximation by the leading approximation of 1/n
expansion. the self-consistency condition is a crucial key to the description of broken phase.
this condition directly leads to the gap equation which determines the value of condensate
and, equivalently, the physical fermion mass. as a result of symmetry breaking, there emerges
a nambu-goldstone boson. since we do not have any fundamental scalar boson in the njl
model, the ng boson (pion) should be supplied dynamically as a bound state of a fermion and
an anti-fermion. mass of the pionic state indeed vanishes in the chiral limit. note that we
can show that the generalized model (2.1) also exhibits the chiral symmetry breaking hi 6= 0.
results do not depend on the value of parameter  in leading order of the 1/n expansion.

2.2 setup in the lf quantization

we analyze the model (2.1) in the dlcq method and take special care of the longitudinal
zero modes of scalars.
in this method, we compactify the longitudinal space into a circle
x  [l, l] with appropriate boundary conditions on elds. for scalars, we impose periodic
boundary conditions at each lf time

(x = l, x) = (x = l, x),
(x = l, x) = (x = l, x),

so that we can explicitly treat the longitudinal zero modes dened by

0(x) =

0(x) =

l

1

2lz l
2lz l

1

l

dx (x),

dx (x).

(2.4)
(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

then the scalar elds are decomposed into the zero modes and the remaining oscillation modes:

(x) = 0(x) + (x),
(x) = 0(x) + (x).

4

(2.8)
(2.9)

on the other hand, we impose an antiperiodic boundary condition for the fermion eld,

a(x = l, x) = a(x = l, x).

(2.10)

here we must be careful about the boundary condition on the bad component of the fermion.
as we discuss in the next section, if we decompose the fermion as

a = a

+ + a

, a

  a,

(2.11)

we nd that  (bad component) is a dependent eld (see appendix for the denition of
). so the boundary condition on  should be imposed consistently with the dynamics. for
example, if we imposed the periodic boundary condition on  and antiperiodic on +, the
mass term  and the fermions kinetic term became antiperiodic. this is not desirable as a
term in the lagrangian and even not consistent with the scalar sector. then how about the
periodic boundary conditions for both of + and ? in this case we have a dynamical zero
mode of +, which is, however, not important to our problem because the chiral condensate
will be related to the zero modes of  or . periodic fermion will give unnecessary intricacy
to the problem. therefore the antiperiodic boundary condition (2.10) is appropriate.

3 classical aspect

classical analysis is necessary for specifying independent degrees of freedom. in this section,
we determine the constraint structure of the model and dene the lf chiral transformation.
chiral current and charge are explicitly given.

3.1 constraints

the system has three constraints: a constraint for  (fermionic constraint) and two constraints
for zero modes of bosons (zero-mode constraints). the euler-lagrange equation for  itself
is the fermionic constraint:

ia

 =

1
2

(i + m +   i5)+a
+ .

(3.1)

also the zero-mode constraints for 0(x) and 0(x) are easily obtained from x-integration
of the euler-lagrange equations for  and , respectively:

where [
0 should be represented by other independent variables.
if we take the    limit, the
zero-mode constraints are reduced to zero-mode projected equations of the familiar relations
i5. eventually the independent degrees of freedom are , ,

the above constraints are, of course, derived from diracs procedure. it is easily found that
they belong to the second class and there are no more constraints. the light-front hamiltonian

3.2 chiral transformation on the lf

the denition of chiral transformation on the lf is dierent from the usual one dened by
eqs. (2.2) and (2.3). this is because the identication of independent degrees of freedom is
not the same as usual. as we saw, 0, 0 and a
 are dependent variables and should change
as a result of transformation of the independent variables ,  and a
+. therefore in the lf
formulation, we impose the chiral transformation only on the dynamical variables:

+  ei5a
a
+ ,
(cid:18) 
(cid:19)  r(2)(cid:18) 
(cid:19) ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

where r(2) represents a rotation matrix dened in eq. (2.3). these are the denition of the
if we nd that  and (0, 0) also transform as   ei5
lf chiral transformation.
and (0, 0)t  r(2)(0, 0)t as a result of (3.4) and (3.5), we can say that the lf chiral
transformation is substantially equivalent to the usual one (2.2) and (2.3). however, what is
surprising about the lf chiral transformation is that the transformation (3.4) is an exact
symmetry even for massive fermion as far as interaction is absent [13]. so it will be interesting
to check whether the lf chiral transformation in our model is exact or not when a mass term
is present.

in order to see the transformation property of the dependent variables, let us solve the con-
straints classically. the fermionic constraint (3.1) which was originally a complicated relation
in the purely fermionic njl model4, is now easily solved owing to introduction of scalars:

a

 =

1

i (cid:20) 1

+(cid:21) ,
2(cid:16)i + m +   i5(cid:17) +a

(3.6)

where 1
 is dened so that (x) also satises the antiperiodic boundary condition (see
appendix). note that however this solution still contains the zero modes 0 and 0 and thus

4it is dicult but possible to solve the fermionic constraint in classical treatment where we just treat the

spinors as grassmannian numbers. the exact solution obtained is highly nonlocal and complicated [12].

is not a complete solution. substituting (3.6) into eq. (3.2), we have equations only for 0 and
0. the formal solution is then given by

substituting eq. (3.7) into eq. (3.6), we obtain the nal expression for . in the classical
solution, we have completely ignored ordering which becomes an issue in a quantum theory.
now we nd the transformation of the zero modes and subsequently that of . when

m = 0, the transformation (3.4) and (3.5) induces the following:

(cid:18) 0
0(cid:19)  r(2)(cid:18) 0
0(cid:19) ,
  ei5a

.

(3.8)

(3.9)

this is identical with the usual chiral transformation. therefore it is shown that when m = 0
the elds do transform as (2.2) and (2.3) even on the lf at the classical level.

now that we know all the transformation laws, it is easy to construct the noether current
and charge. the lagrangian with m = 0 is invariant under the lf chiral transformations. form
of the lf chiral current is equivalent to the usual one,

 =  a5a +
j5

2n

2 (cid:16)  (cid:17).

(3.10)

however, 0, 0 and  in (3.10) should be understood as solutions of constraints. on the
other hand, the lf chiral charge qlf

5 does not include the constrained variables:

5 =r d3x j+
2a

+ 5a

+ +

qlf

5 =z d3x"

2n

2 (cid:16)  (cid:17)# ,

(3.11)

which is consistent with the fact that qlf
is a generator of the chiral rotation for independent
5
variables. transformation of other dependent elds should be obtained through the change of
dynamical variables.

let us briey comment on the massive case. as mentioned before, the lf chiral transfor-
mation is an exact symmetry even for a massive free fermion. however, our lagrangian (2.1)
for m 6= 0 is not invariant under the lf chiral transformation because of the interaction term.

4 quantum aspects

in the classical analysis, we formally solved the constraints in order to nd the lf chiral current
and charge. when m = 0, the resulting hamiltonian is chiral symmetric and we do not have any

7

symmetry breaking term. therefore even if we go to quantum theory with such hamiltonian,
we will not be able to describe the chiral symmetry breaking. certainly it might be possible
that we could nd a broken phase hamiltonian by adjusting the operator ordering, but it seems
unnatural and tricky. instead, we quantize the model before solving the constraints. this means
that we perform the dirac quantization for constrained systems. after that, the constraints are
solved quantum mechanically with a care of the operator ordering. the same route has been
traced by many people in recent years in order to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking
of simple scalar systems [5].

calculation of the dirac brackets in our system is a very complicated task. however,
the dirac brackets between dynamical variables turn out to be standard ones: quantization

zero. note that these conditions are irrespective of the phase of the model because they are
independent of the interaction.

it is important to note that both of the above mode expansions are independent of the mass.
(the spinors w(h) are independent of mass. this is clearly shown in the appendix of ref. [9].)
this means that if we calculate n-point green functions at xed time x+ = 0, they will become
independent of the value of mass, which is not a correct result in general. this undesirable
situation is known as one of the pathological properties of the lf formalism which needs great
care for obtaining correct results [14].
indeed, as we will see later, to remedy this problem

8

is indispensable to get a meaningful gap equation. in many cases, loss of mass information is
cured by a carefully chosen infrared regularization. it should also be commented that the mass-
information loss is certainly not a desirable feature, but we will nd its utility in describing
the broken phase physics. anyway, we must pay great attention to the fact that naive mode
expansion of the (scalar and fermion) elds is independent of the value of mass.

n , p)|0i = ba(p+

n , p, h)|0i = da(p+

n , p, h)|0i = 0,

(4.5)

for n > 0. it is worth while emphasizing that the vacuum of this system is really the fock
vacuum because we have no dynamical zero modes. because of the p+ conservation, the normal-
ordered chiral charge qlf

5 always annihilates the vacuum:

qlf
5 |0i = 0.

(4.6)

it has been known that any light-like charge qlf automatically leaves the vacuum invariant
qlf|0i = 0 whether or not it generates a symmetry [15].
in a quantum theory, operator ordering becomes an issue. let us comment on the problem
of operator ordering and clarify our stance toward it. since the (zero-mode and fermionic)
constraint equations are generally nonlinear relations among operators, their solutions depend
on operator ordering. we must select an appropriate operator ordering. then, what can be the
criterion for this problem? in many papers discussing the spontaneous symmetry breaking in
dlcq, the weyl ordering is adopted on general grounds. however, it is not clear whether the
weyl ordering in constraint equations makes sense because they include both independent and
dependent variables. the most reliable criterion for determining the operator ordering will be
as follows. before solving the constraint equations, we can calculate the dirac brackets between
independent variables and dependent ones (e.g. [0, +] =   ), which are terribly complicated
in our model and we do not display them in this paper. here we already have to specify the
operator ordering. on the other hand, we can solve the constraint relations with the above
ordering and obtain their solutions such as 0 = 0(, , +). now we can calculate again
the commutators between the solutions (i.e. dependent variables) and independent variables
(e.g. [0(, , +), +] ) using simple commutators eqs. (4.1) and (4.2). the results should
be identical with those of the dirac bracket. in other words, we must nd out such operator
ordering that will give a consistent result in the above sense. this should be the criterion for
an appropriate operator ordering. however, as you expect, to nd such ordering in our model
is an extremely dicult task. so practically, we just work with several particular orderings
and compare the results. in our actual calculations, we treat two specic orderings and check
whether the results depend on the ordering or not. to nd a consistent operator ordering
should be examined in much simpler models.

in the following, we will solve the zero-mode constraints in two dierent ways: perturbative
and non-perturbative methods. to solve the constraint is signicant to describe the symmetry
breaking on the lf. to see this, let us decompose the longitudinal zero modes into c-number
parts and normal-ordered operator parts,

0 = (c)
0 = (c)

0 + (op)
0 + (op)

0

0

,

.

(4.7)

(4.8)

if the c-number part of the solution is nonvanishing, it directly means nonzero condensation:
h0||0i = (c)
6= 0. therefore to nd such nontrivial solution is necessary

6= 0 and h0||0i = (c)

0

to describe the symmetry breaking. we explicitly demonstrate that the perturbative solution
cannot lead to chiral symmetry breaking while the nonperturbative solution gives nonzero
vacuum expectation value for . in both cases, the fermionic constraint is formally solved as
in eq. (3.6) and inserted into the zero-mode constraints.

4.1 perturbative solutions to the zero-mode constraints

let us solve the zero-mode constraints using perturbation in terms of the coupling constant .
since  is a dimensionful parameter, we introduce some scale cr which is much larger than
 (cr  ). we regard cr as a critical coupling of the symmetry breaking which will be
determined later. now we expand the constrained variables as follows

now let us check the chiral rotation of the perturbative solution given above for the massless
case. using the inductive method, we can show that the perturbative solution transforms

vanish in all order of perturbation h0|0|0i = h0|0|0i = 0. this is easily veried by using

++|0i = 0. therefore we are in a chiral symmetric phase:

h0||0i = h0||0i = 0.

4.2 nonperturbative solutions to the zero-mode constraints

we next solve the zero-mode constraints using the mean-eld approximation. in the following,
we work with a particular operator ordering though the result is the same as others as far as we
discuss the leading order of 1/n. the following ordering greatly reduces our calculation. sub-
stituting the solution into the fermionic constraint into the zero-mode constraints and rearrange
the ordering, we obtain

let us rst determine the c-number part of the zero modes dened by eqs. (4.7) and (4.8).

fermion mass. in other words, the identication in eq. (4.31) corresponds to the self-consistency
condition.

eq. (4.30) should be the gap equation by which we can determine (c)

0 and equivalently, the
physical fermion mass m. however, it is not evident to regard it as the gap equation because
eq. (4.30) in the chiral limit m  0 cannot give nonzero m. the same situation was observed
in our previous work on the gross-neveu model [11]. as was discussed in ref. [11], if we want
a meaningful gap equation, we must supply mass information so that eq. (4.30) possesses a
nontrivial solution m 6= 0 in the chiral limit when we regularize the divergent summation over
n. the need of the mass dependence in eq. (4.30) is readily understood from the identication
in eq. (4.31). indeed, one can easily check that h0| m m|0i/m should explicitly depend on
m in the equal-time formulation. this is a typical example of the mass-information loss on
the lf [14] which must be repaired properly for obtaining correct results.

it may be possible to regularize the divergent summation in eq. (4.30) with, say, a heat-
kernel damping factor [11], but such calculation is complicated and not tractable. instead, we

12

introduce some cuto that renders the divergent summation into nite one. such cuto should
be introduced so that the result correctly depends on the mass m. here for simplicity, we
adopt a cuto which eventually reduces to the parity invariant (pi) cuto p <  [8]. from
the dispersion relation and the pi cuto, we nd that the momentum region is restricted to
(m 2 + p2

n = n/l < . therefore we set

)/2 < p+

nir < n < nuv,

(4.33)

where nir and nuv are nearest half-integers to l

  respectively.

 and suciently large l. of course there is nite volume eect for
nite l, but we nally take the innite volume limit and the nite volume eect is expected
to be small as far as l is large enough5. eventually eq. (4.30) becomes dependent on the mass
m and can be considered to be a gap equation

(4.35)

indeed, even in the chiral limit m  0, this equation is a nonlinear equation for m and when the
coupling constant  is larger than the critical value cr = 22/2, there is a nontrivial solution
m = (c)
6= 0. if we select this nontrivial solution, it immediately follows h i 6= 0. therefore
0
the system is in the broken phase of the chiral symmetry. on the other hand, there is a trivial
solution m = 0 even for  > cr and if we select this solution the resulting theory becomes
chiral symmetric. then there comes a problem which solution should be physically realized.
unfortunately, comparison of the vacuum energy for both phases does not tell anything about
this problem because the vacuum energies turn out to be the same. if we found the consistent
operator ordering as discussed before, we could estimate dierence of the vacuum energies and
determine the physically realized phase. even without such calculation, however, we can say
that the symmetric solution is excluded for  > cr. this is because there emerge tachyonic
modes and the system becomes unstable if we select a trivial solution for  > cr. this will be
again discussed in section 5.2. so we deal with only the nontrivial solution for  > cr and do
not consider the symmetric solution.

comments on other cuto schemes are in order. we nd a nontrivial equation for m by using
the pi cuto. it was crucial to include the mass information as the regularization. however,
we have to be careful in setting the cuto. any cuto scheme which holds mass does not
necessarily lead to a physically sensible result [17]. for example, a two dimensional pi cuto
m 2/2 < p+ <  with a transverse cuto |p| <  gives a wrong result. the resulting gap
equation erroneously predicts that there is no symmetric phase. it seems important to introduce

5 finite volume physics itself is intriguing. for example, similarly to the equal-time calculation [16], if we
make the volume smaller and smaller, we will meet a critical length lcr beyond which the chiral symmetry never
breaks down. moreover, if we could determine the l dependence of the physical mass m (l), it would serve
as a prediction for the limiting behavior of eigenvalues in the numerical dlcq calculation. nevertheless, such
nite volume physics is outside the scope of this paper and we do not discuss it anymore. we always assume l
suciently large and ignore the nite volume eects.

a cuto with some symmetry considerations. indeed, the three momentum cuto respecting
the three dimensional rotation [7] and the pi cuto [8] in our case predict the existence of the
critical coupling constant.

now let us determine the operator parts of the zero modes by the mean-eld approximation.
we approximate the nonlinear terms in eq. (4.25) by using ab  ahbi + haib  haihbi,
where the expectation values are taken with respect to the fock vacuum. we further neglect
contribution from the oscillating modes of scalars  =  = 0. then the operator parts are

to understand what we did above, let us consider the relation between our operator ordering
and the 1/n expansion. we have obtained an equation for the c-number part of 0 (the gap
equation) just by taking the vacuum expectation value of the zero-mode constraint even without
recorse to the 1/n expansion. this simplicity in obtaining the gap equation is mainly due
to our specic choice of the operator ordering. as has been commented before, if we take
other orderings, our calculation becomes terrible because of complicated structure of the dirac
brackets between constrained zero modes and physical variables. however, as far as the leading
term of the 1/n expansion is concerned, the commutator [0, +] turns out to be of the order of
o(1/n) and we can ignore the eect of ordering6. furthermore, the approximation neglecting
the scalar oscillating modes is also justied by the 1/n expansion. from the quantization
condition (4.1), we nd  is o(n 1/2) whereas 0 is o(n 0). these considerations justify
that our mean-eld calculation with the specic operator ordering is correct upto the leading
contribution of the 1/n expansion.

so far, we treat nite . however, the gap equation is independent of the value of , which
means that the chiral symmetry breaking occurs for arbitrary value of  in the mean-eld
approximation. this is consistent with the result of the conventional equal-time quantization.
nh i = m.
therefore we may regard the nite  result hi = m as the result for innite ;  
before ending this section, it will be better to point out the merit of the mass-information
loss. certainly it was a demerit in deriving the gap equation, but this property gives a very
important benet to our framework. the fact that the mode expansion is independent of the
value of mass in turn means that the fock vacuum dened by (4.5) keeps invariant even if we
change the value of mass. we do not have to perform the bogoliubov transformation on the
vacuum depending on the change of mass. therefore the lf vacuum is invariant even after the
fermion acquires dynamical mass m 6= 0.

5 physics in nonperturbative region

in this section, we discuss some physics consequences of our method. firstly, we explicitly
demonstrate how the triviality of the null-plane chiral charge qlf
5 and the nonzero chiral con-
densate reconcile with each other. secondly, masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons are
calculated from the lagrangian for both phases.

5.1 null-plane chiral charge vs chiral condensation

in the equal-time quantization, the broken vacuum does not possess the chiral symmetry
qet

parameter h i and the more strict expression of qet
5 , i5]|0i =
h0|r d3x [j0
5(x), i5]|0i = 2ih0| |0i 6= 0. therefore there is no inconsistency between these
two relations. on the other hand, remember that the light-like charge always annihilates the
, i5] ?= 2i  held on the light front in
vacuum. this implies that if a similar relation [q(lf)
the broken phase h0| |0i 6= 0, it would immediately conict with the triviality of the chiral
charge qlf

these are the fundamental laws of the chiral transformation. any transformation of the de-
pendent elds 0, 0, and  should be derived from them.

in the broken phase  > cr, the gap equation has a nontrivial solution m 6= 0 and the
fermion behaves as a massive fermion with the dynamical mass m. first of all, let us view the
chiral transformation of the massive fermion operator m dened by eq. (4.32). the result is

clearly the terms involving m and (op)
are not present in the usual chiral transformation.
they do not vanish even in the chiral limit. these extra terms are direct consequences of being
dependent variables and the dynamical generation of the fermion mass m. unlike the equal-
time calculation, the chiral transformation of the full eld variables becomes model-dependent
in general because a part of the variables are constrained and the information of interaction
inevitably enters the transformation law of constrained variables through the solutions.

in addition to the rst term that is equivalent to the usual result, we have nonvanishing extra

as a result of these unusual chiral transformation, even the hamiltonian loses the chiral
5 , hi 6= 0 in the

symmetry in the broken phase. exactly in the same way, we can show hqlf

operator level. this means that the lf chiral charge is not conserved in the broken phase. it
is very interesting that the chiral symmetry breaking can be expressed as an explicit breaking
in the lf formulation7. the important dierence is that usual explicit breaking does not
accompany the gap equation, while in our case the gap equation plays a very important role in
many aspects.

let us turn to the symmetric phase where the coupling is large but slightly less than the
critical value  < cr.
in this region, we use the symmetric solution of the gap equation.
if we restrict ourselves to the chiral limit m = 0, the solution is just a trivial one m = 0.
transformation law in this phase is obtained by simply substituting m = 0 into the above
results. therefore in the leading order of 1/n expansion, all the dependent elds transform in
a chiral symmetric way:

i = 2i(op)
i = 5a

5.2 masses of the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons

unlike the njl model, we have dynamical scalars in the lagrangian. therefore masses of the
scalar and pseudoscalar bosons are obtained directly from the poles of propagators without con-
sidering bound-state equations for a fermion and an antifermion. the procedure of calculating
the pole masses is as follows. first we insert the broken or unbroken solutions 0, 0, and 
into the original lagrangian. for simplicity, we ignore the nite l eect. this is because we
are only interested in the eects of the condensation (c)
0 and the nonzero constituent mass m.
next, reading the fermion propagator from the lagrangian, we calculate the scalar propagators
,(k2) upto one loop of the fermion. finally, the pole masses are obtained from the equation
1

,(k2 = m2

,) = 0.

therefore the mass of the pion goes to zero in the chiral limit and we can identify it with the

it is important to recognize that eq. (5.23) implies the existence of tachyonic modes for

it is generally known that the zero-mode constraint for the ng boson becomes inconsistent
in the broken phase unless we introduce nite mass of the ng boson by hand as regularization
[18]. a similar situation is observed in our analysis. the zero-mode constraint for 0 is simply
written as (m2
l dxf (x, x). suppose mzm = 0 and introduce the periodic

boundary condition on 0 in the transverse directions, then the transverse integralr d2x of the
zero-mode constraint leads to inconsistency8 0 =r d2xr l
l dxf (x, x) 6= 0, which suggests
to introduce zero-mode mass mzm 6= 0. in our calculation, the origin of the the nite mass of
the ng boson is the fermions bare mass m. indeed, m2

the other hand, in the symmetric phase m2

mass m. both become nonzero due to nonzero bare mass m 6= 0, but we have to calculate
fermions one loop to obtain the physical pion mass m.

6 conclusion and discussions

we have studied a method of describing the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on the lf. our
description is based on the idea in dlcq that the symmetry breaking is achieved by solving the
zero-mode constraints, which already succeeded to some extent in describing the spontaneous
symmetry breaking in simple scalar models. the point is that we can utilize this idea even
for the dynamical symmetry breaking in fermionic systems if we introduce bosonic auxiliary
elds for  and i5, and treat them as dynamical variables by adding their kinetic terms.
then the problem can be formulated such that we nd a nontrivial solution to the zero-mode
constraint. we exemplied this idea in the njl model. the model we studied is a chiral
symmetric yukawa-like model, which reproduces the njl model in the innitely heavy mass
limit of the scalars. within this model, we showed the equivalence between light-front chiral
transformation and the usual one by classically solving the three (i.e. two zero-mode and one
fermionic) constraints. this allowed us to construct the chiral current j5
5 . even
if we solve the constraints classically, the resulting theory cannot have a symmetry breaking
term. quantum analysis showed that the zero-mode constraint for a scalar boson  became the
gap equation in nonperturbative treatment, which lead to nonzero condensation hi 6= 0 and
8the mean-eld result avoids this inconsistency due tor d3x m i5m = 0. however, higher order calcula-

tion requires nonzero bare mass.

equivalently to the chiral symmetry breaking. we found the critical coupling cr beyond which
the fermion acquires nonzero dynamical mass. on the other hand, a perturbative solution could
not give fermion condensate even in the quantum theory.

the most important key of our description was the identication of the zero-mode constraint
of  with the gap equation. this was suered from a severe problem that the correct mass de-
pendence disappears from the mode expansion. of course this is a demerit of the lf formalism
and we have to carefully incorporate mass dependence into e.g. h i when we regularize its
infrared divergence. it is suggestive that cuto schemes with symmetry consideration such as
parity or rotational invariance lead to physically acceptable results. contrary to such negative
aspects, the mass-information loss has a useful and important aspect. it follows that the fock
vacuum keeps invariant even if we change the value of mass. therefore the vacuum does not
change even though the symmetry breaking occurs and the fermion acquires dynamical mass.
in our formalism, the vacuum is exactly the fock vacuum. the inclusion of dynamical scalar
elds was neccesary to clarify the structure of the hilbert space and the triviality of the vac-
uum. the way of realizing broken phase is that the vacuum is still trivial but the operator
structure of the dependent variables changes. in other words, the vacuum physics in conven-
tional formulation is converted into the hamiltonian through the dependent variables. the zero
modes of scalars and the bad component  are constrained variables and dierently expressed
by physical variables depending on the phases. related to this, the lf chiral transformation
of the dependent variables also becomes unusual in the broken phase. consequently, a seem-
ingly contradiction between the triviality of the null-plane charge qlf
5 |0i = 0 and the chiral
condensation h i 6= 0 is resolved.
we further calculated masses of  and  for both symmetric and broken phases. in the
broken phase, the mass of  goes to zero in the chiral limit, which is consistent with the ng
theorem. if we substitute symmetric solution into the lagrangian, there appear tachyon modes
for  > cr. therefore we can say that when  > cr, physically realized phase is the broken
phase. certainly we have massless pion in the model, but it is very dicult to verify the ng
theorem in general on the lf. this is because we have nonlocal interaction and because the
chiral transformation of the full elds explicitly depends on the model. both of these arise
from the fact that in lf formalism the bad component of fermion and zero modes of scalars
are constrained variables.

in our calculation, nonperturbative implied the mean-eld approximation. this mean-
eld calculation is justied as the leading order approximation in the 1/n expansion.
in
principle, we can develop a systematic 1/n expansion to go beyond the mean-eld result.
nevertheless, the higher order will severely depend on the operator ordering and it is not
clear whether the result with our specic ordering makes sense. if we want to go beyond the
leading order, we have to determine the consistent operator ordering according to the criterion
discussed in the text. since this is a very dicult task in our model, it should be examined in
much simpler models such as 1+1 dimensional yukawa theory.

it will be challenging to use other nonperturbative method to solve the zero-mode constraint.
for example, tamm-danco approximation which truncates the fock space into a few particle
states will give some nontrivial results. notice that our leading 1/n approximation corresponds
to the two body truncation since multiquark states give higher order contribution.

our method here heavily relies on the introduction of auxiliary elds. so it seems natural to
ask a question: can we describe the chiral symmetry breaking without introducing the auxiliary
elds? the answer is of course yes. even though we do not have zero mode constraints, it is
possible to describe the chiral symmetry breaking on the lf. its explicit demonstration in the

20

purely fermionic njl model will be given in our next paper [12]. as far as the njl model is
concerned, to solve the fermionic constraint becomes of great importance.

there still remain many problems which cannot be discussed in our model. one of them
is the issue of renormalization. in a renormalizable theory, if one introduces an infrared cuto
and excludes the zero mode degrees of freedom from the beginning, then the vacuum physics
should be discussed as the problem of renormalization with nonperturbative infrared counter
terms. relation between such counter term approach [20] and the zero-mode approach presented
here is not clear. we need further investigation for understanding how to describe the chiral
symmetry breaking in lfqcd.
