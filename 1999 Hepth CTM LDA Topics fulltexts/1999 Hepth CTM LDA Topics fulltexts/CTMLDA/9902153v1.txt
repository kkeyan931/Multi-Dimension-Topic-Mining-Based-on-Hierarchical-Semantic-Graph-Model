abstract

we compute the two and three-point correlation functions of chiral primary operators in
the large n limit of the (0, 2), d = 6 superconformal theory. we also consider the operator
product expansion of wilson surfaces in the (0, 2) theory and compute the ope coecients
of the chiral primary operators at large n from the correlation functions of surfaces.

introduction

the existence of the (0, 2) tensor multiplet in d = 6 has been known for a long time, but,

until the last few years, there was no evidence suggesting the existence of nontrivial eld

theories for d > 4. this situation has changed with the discovery that interacting (0, 2)

superconformal theories exist in compactications of the iib string on a k3 surface [1], as

well as on the worldvolume of the m-theory 5-brane [2,3]. these theories are of great interest

in themselves, but they are also important because they have applications [46] to matrix

theory [7], as well to the study of 4-dimensional eld theories, including the large n limit of

qcd [8].

although many features of these nontrivial superconformal eld theories were evident

within their string and m-theory realizations, it is only recently that methods were de-

veloped to permit detailed computations within them.

important steps toward a deeper

understanding of these theories were made after realizing their importance in the compacti-

cation of matrix theory. soon afterwards, it was realized that the (0, 2) theory had its own

description as a matrix model [911]. this idea was carefully developed in [12], where the

construction of states and the computation of correlation functions in a discrete light-cone

quantization was discussed.

another route towards the study of interacting superconformal eld theories appears

in the correspondence between antide sitter (ads) spaces and conformal eld theories

(cfts) [1315]. one aspect of this connection is that the large n limit of the (0, 2) theory is
described by supergravity on ads7  s4. the correspondence between scft operators and
supergravity kaluza-klein modes in this case was carried out in a series of papers [1619].
in this paper, motivated by the success in computing correlation functions of the n = 4,
d = 4 scft from supergravity, we compute correlation functions in the large n limit of

the (0, 2) theory.

in section 2, we review several features of the (0, 2) theory, in particular the chiral primary

operators that we will be interested in for our computations. in section 3, we perform the

supergravity computations that allow us to extract the 3-point function of the chiral primary

operators of the (0, 2) theory. we use the quadratic corrections to the equations of motion

to nd the necessary cubic terms in the action to compute the 3-point function of the chiral

primary operators, as well as the 3-point function of two chiral primaries with a certain higher

dimensional operator. in an appendix, we point out some subtleties in the computation of

the quadratic action for the scalars corresponding to the chiral primary operators.

in section 4, we consider the operator product expansion (ope) of wilson surfaces of the

(0, 2) theory. we identify the operators which are allowed to appear in the ope and explicitly

1

compute the ope coecients of the chiral primary operators by computing correlation

functions of wilson surfaces.

in the conclusion, we comment on our results and point to avenues of further research.

several appendices collect results which were useful in obtaining the correlation functions.

2. review of the properties of the (0, 2) theory

in the following, we will briey review some of the features of the (0, 2) eld theory. for an

additional discussion, see [20] and the references therein.

in six dimensions, the vector of so(5, 1) appears in the antisymmetric product of two
4s of the spin(4)  su(2)  su(2) little group, 4  4 = 6a  10s, so that spinors in
six dimensions may be taken to be symplectic-majorana-weyl. the supercharges of (0, 2)
susy, qa
, carry a spin(4) spinor index, , and an sp(2)r  so(5) index, a, labeling the
4. the supersymmetry algebra is

, qb

{qa

} = 2ab

p + 

z ab
 ,

(2.1)

where ab is the sp(2)-invariant tensor. a central charge z ab
 is allowed. this central charge
must transform as a lorentz vector (as such, it couples to a string) and under the 5 of
sp(2)r. the only massless representation of (2.1) that does not involve a graviton is the
tensor multiplet. labeling elds by their su(2)  su(2)  sp(2)r representations, the
tensor multiplet contains a 2-form, b, in the (1, 3; 1) whose eld strength h = db is (anti)
self-dual, four fermions, a

, in the (2(1, 2); 4), and ve scalars, ab, in the (1, 1; 5).

the tensor multiplet appears on the m5-brane in the following fashion. the m5-brane

is a bps state in d = 11 supergravity which preserves 16 of the 32 bulk supercharges.

by considering the spectrum of uctuations around the 5-brane supergravity solution, one

nds 16 fermionic and eight bosonic zero modes [21]. five of the bosonic zero modes are

translational, corresponding to uctuations in the directions transverse to the brane, so

they form a 5 of the spin(5) component of the broken 11-dimensional lorentz group. the

other 3 bosonic modes come from uctuations of the bulk 3-form and are arranged in an

antisymmetric 2-form on the 5-brane worldvolume. the fermionic degrees of freedom form a

4 of spin(5). this is exactly the content of the (0, 2) tensor multiplet. an interacting eld

theory is obtained when one considers a conguration of n parallel 5-branes. in this case,

m2-branes are allowed to stretch between the 5-branes [2], leading to n + 1 massless tensor

multiplets on the worldvolumes of the m5-branes. since the worldvolume theory is chiral,

there are no additional massless states arising when the 5-branes are coincident. the scalars

in one linear combination of these tensor multiplets corresponds to the center-of-mass motion

2

of the collection of 5-branes, so that tensor multiplet is free and decouples from the rest of
the theory. the moduli space of scalars in the remaining part of the theory is r5n /sn +1.
the scalars, i
a, are in the irreducible n of sn +1, labeled by a, while i labels the 5 of the
so(5) r-symmetry. the expectation values of the scalars determine the tensions of the
bps strings which appear at the (2  5|1) brane intersections. away from the orbifold
xed points, the theory on the 5-branes is free. at the xed points of the sn +1 group, some
number of 5-branes coincide. there the theory is an interacting superconformal eld theory.

2.1. chiral primary operators of the (0, 2) theory

we are interested in the chiral primary operators of the (0, 2), d = 6, u(n) eld theory.

in [22,23,12], unitarity bounds on the dimensions of operators are obtained. for states which

are lorentz singlets and have sp(2) dynkin labels (l, k), there are superconformal primaries
at dimension 2(l + k) with a null vector at level 1
2, at dimension 2(l + k) + 2 with a null
vector at level 1, at dimension 2(l + k) + 4 with a null vector at level 3
2, and at dimension
2(l + k) + 6 with a null vector at level 2. all of these states belong to short multiplets, so

we expect that the corresponding operators have conformal dimensions which are protected.

we will refer to the primary operators of the shortest of these multiplets as chiral primary

operators.

from these results, it is evident that a rank k symmetric, traceless tensor representation

of so(5), with sp(2) dynkin label (0, k), is a chiral primary eld of dimension  = 2k. that

such states actually exist in the (0, 2) theory was found in the discrete light-cone quantization
(dlcq) approach of [12]. away from the sn +1 xed point, operators of these dimensions
and quantum numbers have a realization in terms of sn +1 invariant, symmetric traceless (in
the so(5) indices) products of k free scalars. at the xed point, it is not clear that this

realization makes any sense, so we will not pursue it further. we will simply denote these
chiral primaries as oi .

correlation functions of these operators are restricted by conformal invariance. the

two-point function is determined up to a free constant, which can be taken to be unity

three-point functions are similarly constrained

2.2. the (0, 2), d = 6 scft and supergravity on ads7  s4
information about the (0, 2) theory at the xed point can be obtained from its realization

on the m5-brane worldvolume. one begins by considering the m-theory solution for a large
number, n, of coincident m5-branes. next, the limit mp  0 is taken, while keeping
the tensions of the strings on the 5-branes (due to membranes which stretch between the 5-
branes) xed. the result is m-theory on ads7s4. for large enough n, the curvature is very
small in planck units, so that classical supergravity is a good approximation to the physics.

on the other hand, this is precisely the same limit that leads to the decoupling of bulk modes

from the (0, 2) theory on the 5-brane worldvolume. one is lead to the conclusion that the
large n limit of the (0, 2) eld theory is described by 11d supergravity on ads7  s4 [13].
a prescription for a generating functional for the correlation functions of operators was

given within the ads/cft correspondence in [14, 15]. each operator in the cft which is

chiral, so that its conformal dimension is protected against renormalization, corresponds to

a mode of the kk compactication of the supergravity on the compact manifold. the mass
of the mode corresponding to an operator of dimension  is m2 = (  d), where d is the
number of cft spacetime dimensions. then correlation functions may be computed from

the formula

der i

0oiecf t  essugra[i

0],

(2.5)

where 0 is the boundary data for the supergravity mode i corresponding to the operator
oi and ssugra[i
0] is the eective action computed from all tree graphs with external  legs.
in the case of the (0, 2) theory, this correspondence was discussed by [1619]. the chiral
primary operators have conformal weight  = 2k, so they correspond to kk-scalars, si with
masses m 2
s = 4k(k  3). these scalars arise as linear combinations of the harmonic modes
of the trace of the metric and the 3-form with indices on the sphere.

4

in order to compute 2 and 3-point functions in the large n limit of the (0, 2) theory

via the prescription (2.5), the supergravity action must be computed to cubic order in the
modes si. in the next section, we discuss in detail the identication of the mode si and
the other supergravity modes which are related to it via constraint equations. we then

follow the methodology of [24] to compute the cubic action from quadratic corrections to

the supergravity equations of motion. the cubic action is then used to obtain 2 and 3-point

correlation functions of the (0, 2) theory at large n.

3. correlation functions from supergravity

the spectrum of states of supergravity on ads7  s4 have been worked out via linearization
around a freund-rubin background in [25,26], as well as via the oscillator formalism in [27].

here we present the equations of motion and background appropriate to the correspondence
with the (0, 2) theory and identify the modes si corresponding to the cpos. we then
consider quadratic corrections to the equation of motion [24] and extract the normalization
of the quadratic action for si and the cubic s-s-s vertex. with this action, we derive the
large n result for the 3-point function (2.3) of normalized operators.

where , , . . . correspond to ads indices, while , , . . . correspond to the sphere. now we

would like to expand around the background (3.5). this is simplied if we weyl-rescale the

metric on ads. then the uctuations are dened as:

fm1m4 = fm1m4 + fm1m4,

(3.6)

where (mn) denotes symmetrization and removal of the trace. the dependence on the coor-

dinates of the sphere is best determined by expanding the uctuations in a basis of spherical
harmonics. with the gauge choices h() = h = amn = 0, the uctuations which
we are interested in have the expansions

and (3.12), after applying the eigenvalue equation (d.3) for the spherical harmonics, we nd

the mode si has the right mass to correspond to a  = 2k operator. since it has an
expansion on s4 in terms of scalar spherical harmonics of degree k  2, each mode transforms
in the rank k symmetric traceless tensor representation of so(5). these are the same
representations as the chiral primaries oi, so we conclude that the si are the corresponding
supergravity modes [1619].

we will also be interested in the modes i appearing in (3.9). applying the eigenvalue
formula for the tensor spherical harmonics (d.13), we nd from (3.9) that these have masses

m2
 = 4k(k + 3), k  2.

(3.15)

the so(5) representation of these modes is that of the rank 2 symmetric, traceless spherical

harmonics, namely the (2, k), where we again use the sp(2) dynkin labels to denote the

representation. from the bounds quoted in section 2.1, an operator in this representation

of dimension  = 2(2 + k) + 2 = 2k + 6 will be protected. this is precisely the conformal
dimension one predicts from the mass formula (3.15). we will denote these operators as i .

7

3.2. the action to cubic order for the modes si and i

now we would like to derive the action to cubic order for these modes. we rst identify the
supergravity elds that depend on si. for our purposes, we can ignore the mass eigenstate ti
in (3.14). this mode corresponds to a scalar operator with dimension  = 2k + 12 and is
not of immediate relevance to our discussion. we can therefore solve (3.14) for hi
2 and
bi in terms of si. from the constraint (3.10), the modes hi are obtained in terms of si
through their dependence on hi
2. additionally, we have to solve the constraint (3.11) to nd
the dependence of hi
() on si. to do this, we note that the only way to get a symmetric
traceless tensor from a scalar is to act with covariant derivatives, so we choose the ansatz

() = hi
hi

() + ()si,

(3.16)

() is independent of si (so we can ignore it for our purposes) and is divergenceless,
() = 0. we then compute the normalization  by putting si on shell and solving the

where hi
hi
constraint (3.10). we nd that

() + gv (k)si,

hi
 = hi
hi
 = w (k)()si + gu(k)si,
bi = x(k)si,

where

(3.17)

(3.18)

.

for the i modes, from the supergravity action (3.1) we nd the quadratic lagrangian

bi

l[i] = 

2 (cid:2)(i)2 + 4k(k + 3)(i)2(cid:3) ,

bi =

z(k)

2

2n 3
5 .

(3.19)

we note that this action is canonical and that the mode dependence of the normalization is

due solely to the properties of the spherical harmonics. in particular, no subtleties arising
from the boundary of ads7 are encountered.

for the modes, si, the computation of the quadratic action is more complicated. imposing
the constraint (3.11) by simple substitution of the solution (3.16) leads to terms in the action
with higher derivatives, of the form (()si)2 and (()si)2.
in [24], where the
analogous modes on ads5  s5 were studied, it was proposed to deal with these terms by

8

computing the action on shell as a function of boundary values. we nd that this procedure
fails, both for ads5  s5 and ads7  s4, to produce a normalization consistent with the
quadratic equations of motion. for the completeness of our discussion we present the details

of these computations in appendix b and comment on why they fail, but we will not need

the (misleading) results to compute the correlation functions.

it turns out that the simplest way of obtaining both the quadratic1 and cubic terms
in the action for the si is by computing quadratic corrections to the equations of motion.
once we have these corrections, we promote them to an action, as explained in [24]. to this

end, the quadratic corrections to equations (3.8), (3.10), (3.12), and (3.9) are computed in

appendix c.
with qi

 from (c.13), we can compute the s-s- vertex. note that the ss corrections

3.3. two and three-point correlation functions at large n

with an action for the modes si computed to cubic order, it is now simple to compute
correlation functions of the corresponding chiral primary operators. we are assuming that

the operators are normalized (2.5), so the coupling appearing in the generating functional

could involve a proportionality constant, i.e.,

der n i si

0oiecf t  essugra[si

0].

(3.34)

the n i will be chosen such that the large n two-point function is normalized. from the
formula (a.13) that generates the two-point function, we nd

(3.35)

(3.36)

we have chosen a minus sign in this expression so that the coecient of the 3-point function

below is positive.

11

from this normalization and the formula for the three-point function (a.15), we nd the

three-point function for chiral primary operators, valid in the large n limit,

the expressions (3.37) and (3.38) are certainly more formidable than the expression found
in [24] for the analogous correlation functions of the cpos of the n = 4, d = 4 scft. one2
can ask if these expressions simplify, given an explicit expression for the hc i1c i2c i3i, which
are related to the clebsch-gordan coecients for so(5). since we know of no closed-form

expression for arbitrary values of k, let us consider the very degenerate case that we have

only the highest and lowest weight states

(3.39)

where the normalization has been chosen to agree with (d.5). in this case, we nd

so, unfortunately, knowing the clebsch-gordan coecients doesnt appear to lead to more

illuminating expressions for the correlation functions.

one further observation we can make about the 3-point functions is that there dont

appear to be any additional zeros beyond those arising from the group-theoretic factor
hc i1c i2c i3i. this is, at least, consistent with the fact that no additional zeros were found
in an analysis, based solely on the properties of the six-dimensional superconformal algebra,

of the 4-point function [22].

from the gss

4. the operator product expansion of wilson surfaces

in [28], it was shown that one could use the ads description of the large n limit of the (0, 2)

superconformal eld theory in six dimensions to compute wilson surface observables [29].

the chiral primaries for these theories are known [1618], so one can use the ads formalism

to write an operator product expansion for such a surface. analogously to the case of the

wilson loop [30], we expect that there exists an operator product expansion for the wilson

surface when it is probed from distances large compared to its characteristic size a,

w (s) = hw (s)i"1 +xi,n

i a(n)

are a set of operators with conformal weights (n)

where the o(n)

i denotes the ith

. here o(0)

i

i

coecient of the identity is the expectation value of the loop.

in [30] the spherical wilson surface solution was studied. the scalar charge of the sur-
face was taken to be constant (a point on s4) and the wilson surface was the boundary (a
2-sphere) of a minimal area membrane worldvolume in ads7  s4. a convenient parameter-

14

ization of the solution was given in terms of the poincare coordinates as

x1 = a2  z2 cos 
x2 = a2  z2 sin  cos 
x3 = a2  z2 sin  sin ,

where 0  z  a, 0    , and 0    2.

the volume of the membrane was found to be divergent

(4.2)

(4.3)

where the tension of the membrane is t (2) = 2n/ in our units. the quadratic divergence is
proportional to the area of the surface and was present in the case of a rectangular wilson

surface [28]. the logarithmic divergence was found to be proportional to the rigid string
action [31], where for a general 2-surface 2,

srigid =z2

(4.4)

where  is the induced metric on the wilson surface and the x i are the coordinates on r6
describing the surface. it was conjectured in [30] that tensionless strings in the (0, 2) six-

dimensional eld theory might be governed by some supersymmetric form of the action (4.4).

in fact, this instance of a conformal anomaly is part of a much more general structure, as

discussed in [32].

one implication of the logarithmic divergence in (4.3) is that the expectation value of

the wilson surface is not well dened, since we can add any constant to the logarithmic

subtraction. furthermore, it seems to indicate that the expectation value of a wilson surface

is scale dependent. despite this, the connected correlation functions of wilson surfaces do

not receive extra divergent contributions. therefore their correlators can be calculated in

a completely analogous fashion to the wilson loops in [30], allowing the extraction of ope

coecients of (4.1). in this section, we investigate the ope for the spherical wilson surface.

we consider a wilson surface whose characteristic size is much smaller than its distance

from any probe in the theory. then we identify the operators of low conformal dimension

that are allowed to appear in the ope and we compute the necessary correlation functions

to extract the ope coecients.

15

4.1. the operator product expansion of the spherical wilson surface

the possible operators which can appear in the wilson surface must have the same symmetry
properties as the wilson surface itself, so the operators o(n)
should be bosonic and sn +1
invariant. the wilson loop and surface solutions of [28] require a massive quark in the
theory, and hence a non-zero higgs vev. we consider the case where i(s) = i is a constant,
which breaks the r-symmetry group from so(5)  so(4). so we should look for operators
in so(5) representations which have so(4) singlets in their decomposition. we also consider

i

only operators whose dimensions are protected. the appearance in the ope of operators

with large anomalous dimensions will be suppressed.

the rst level at which operators can appear is at dimension  = 4, where we have the
rst cpo. this operator is in the 14  1  4  9 under so(4), so it is allowed. in general,
the cpos, being in the symmetric traceless representations of so(5), always contain one

so(4) singlet, and hence all of them may appear in the ope.

at dimension  = 5, there are two operators to consider. there is a spin(5, 1) vector
operator in the 10  4  6 which does not contribute a singlet. there is also a lorentz 3-
form operator in the 5  1 4 which is allowed to contribute, depending on the orientation,
, of the membrane. this is the rst operator in a series of lorentz 3-form, so(5) rank k
symmetric traceless tensor operators of dimension  = 2k + 3, and all of these can appear.
below we denote these operators as oi

at dimension  = 6, we have the cpo at k = 3 which, as discussed above, is permitted
in the ope. additionally there is the rst (k = 0) member of a series in the 20 of spin(5, 1)
and the rank k symmetric traceless tensor of so(5), with dimensions  = 2k + 6.

.

higher dimension operators can be analyzed in the same fashion. we arrive at the

following expression for the ope

w (s)
hw (s)i

= 1l + c(0)

2 a4 y i()oi + c(0)

3 a5 y i()oi

 +    ,

(4.5)

where the y i() denote spherical harmonics on s4 and the coecients c(n)
to compute.

i

are what we wish

the coecients of the operator product expansion (4.5) can be determined in a few ways.

one can compute the correlator of the wilson surface with each operator that is expected

to appear in the ope. this correlator gets contributions only from the given conformal

primary and its descendents. for a wilson surface of size a, separated from an operator by

(4.6)

where we have assumed that the operators have been normalized. here we have isolated the

contribution from the descendents and their mixings with the primaries in the second term.

one can also compute the correlator of a pair of wilson surfaces that are separated by a

distance l which is large compared to their size. this correlator can be calculated from the

operator product expansion for the two wilson surfaces

hw (s, l)w (s, 0)i

in the last line, the rst term is due solely to the primary elds, while the second contains

the contributions from descendents.

4.2. wilson surface correlators and ope coecients from supergravity

we would now like to investigate the process of extracting the large n values of the ope

coecients by using the ads/cft correspondence to compute correlation functions like (4.6)

or (4.7). if we consider two closely separated wilson surfaces, then, analogously to the case of

two wilson loops [33], for small enough separation, instead of having two separate membranes

forming the surfaces, a single membrane worldsheet with both surfaces as its boundary will

be the conguration of minimal surface area. as the surfaces are separated beyond a critical

distance, this worldsheet will degenerate into a long, thin cylinder connecting two minimal

surfaces. in a worldsheet picture, this long, thin cylinder would represent the bulk picture

of propagation of light supergravity states between the two membranes.

this picture tells us that the correlation functions (4.6) and (4.7) can be calculated by

treating the membrane as a source for the elds propagating in anti-de sitter spacetime

and then computing the eective action for the propagation of supergravity states from the

surface to the point where the other operator, or the other surface, is located. this is, of

course, the analog of the method used for the wilson loop in [30].

we would like to compute the coupling of the membrane to the bulk supergravity elds.

we will be content with considering only the lightest scalar modes, which are the most rel-

17

evant when the surfaces are separated by a distance which is large compared to their size.
the lightest states include the modes si from section 3, corresponding to the appearance
of the cpos in the ope. we saw that these modes were related to several components of
the supergravity uctuations in (3.6). couplings to the modes bi will be through world-
volume fermions, and should be suppressed in the small spacetime curvature limit that we

are considering. the couplings to modes of the graviton can be obtained by linearizing the

membrane eective action

se. = t (2)z d3pdet gmnxmxn

= t (2)z d3pdet gmnxmxn(cid:20)1 +

1
2

(gmnxmxn)1hmnxmxn +   (cid:21) .

(4.8)

since the membrane is living at a point on s4, we are only interested in the components hi
which, from (3.17), may be written in terms of si as

,

hi
 = 

1
14

gsi +

3

16k(2k + 1)()si.

(4.9)

to aid in computing the derivatives, we can use an argument from [30], which was also

used to derive (b.5). namely, we are looking for the leading terms in the expansions in a/l

of (4.6) and (4.7). these leading contributions arise from derivatives with respect to z which

act on the numerator of the expansion into a greens function, e. g., (a.9). so we nd

we nd that the coupling to the membrane is given by

gzz(cid:1) si.

ssi =

8 z dv

z2
a2 si.

(4.10)

(4.11)

the contributions to the correlator of two wilson surfaces due to exchange of si modes

are then expressed as

hw (s, l)w (s, 0)i(s)
hw (s, l)ihw (s, 0)i

8 (cid:19)2
= exp"xk (cid:2)y i()(cid:3)2(cid:18) 3t (2)

z dv dv (zz)2

a4 gk(w )# .

(4.12)

if the distance between the surfaces is much larger than their size, then we may approximate

the greens function for propagation between the two loops by the expression (a.8). we

nd that

hw (s, l)ihw (s, 0)i xk

have been dropped but the numerical coecient corresponding to the coecient of the con-

5. conclusions

in this paper we have succeeded in computing 3-point correlation functions of chiral primary

operators in the large n limit of the (0, 2) superconformal eld theory. we also studied the

operator product expansion for a spherical wilson surface, and found that we could compute

correlation functions of two surfaces as well as that for a surface with a local operator. we

used these correlation functions to extract the explicit large n values of operator product

coecients for the chiral primary operators. extracting more information about the (0, 2)

theory from our results is an exciting prospect to be left for future work.

it would also be interesting to study the 3-point function from the perspective of the

dlcq formulation of the (0, 2) theory using the prescription of [12]. a discussion of the com-

parison of dlcq theories of m5-branes and the ads/cft correspondence appears in [34].

in particular, in the large n limit of the dlcq, there should be exact agreement with our

results.

a. greens functions and correlation functions

in this appendix, we list some properties of greens functions on ads which will be useful
to us in the main text. we also discuss the method we use to ensure that the limit z  0 is
taken properly when computing correlation functions. scalar greens functions on anti-de

sitter space have been discussed in a large number of papers, including [14, 15, 18, 3537].

in the text, we consider a real scalar eld  on anti-de sitter spacetime of radius one.

b. the quadratic action for the si modes

in the text we need a lagrangian for the modes si up to cubic order. in order to obtain
the cubic s-s-s vertex from the quadratic equation of motion (3.31), we needed to know
the normalization of the quadratic si action.
normalization by comparison of the equations of motion (3.20) and (3.27), used to extract
the s-s- vertex. in [24, 39] the computation of the quadratic action for the si modes on
ads5 s5 was performed ( [39] actually considers the quadratic action for every mode) using
two dierent methods.

in section 3, we were able to obtain this

we can rst attempt to use the procedure described in [24]. namely, we expand the la-
grangian (3.1) to quadratic order in all elds which depend on si, as determined by (3.18).

we keep all terms in the expansion of g r, including total derivatives, and apply the
equations of motion whenever possible. to enforce the constraint (3.10), we directly substi-
tute the solution for h() given by (3.16). via this method, we also succeeded in recovering

22

equation (3.22) of [24] when expanding around the ads5  s5 background. in the present
case, we nd the lagrangian quadratic in the modes si

l[si ] =

1024k2(2k + 1)2 (()si)2(cid:19) ,

(b.1)

where z(k) is the value of the integral over spherical harmonics given in (d.6).

we wish to use the action (b.1) to compute the 2-point function of the cpos. according

to the prescription of [14, 15], we should compute the action as a function of boundary

values. in order to do this, we must carefully separate the boundary terms from the bulk in

the higher-derivative terms. for this, we compute

(()si)2 =(sisi)  2(2k(k  3)  3)(si)2

16k2(k  3)2

(si)2,



7

(()si)2 =(sisi)  2(2k(k  3)  7)(sisi)

+
 32k2(k  3)2(si)2,
on shell. we use these to rewrite (b.1) as

l[si] = 

2n 3z(k)

5

+

27

128k(2k + 1)2

(cid:2)(si)2 + 4k(k  3)(si)2(cid:3)

(cid:18)9(k + 1)(6k2 + 2k + 3)
256k2(2k + 1)(sisi)
1024k2(2k + 1)2(sisi)(cid:19) ,

+

9

(b.2)

(b.3)

which demonstrates that the quadratic action vanishes on shell in the bulk, as expected.

in order to nish the computation, we need to collect the surface terms in (b.3) and

compute them as a function of boundary values [14, 15, 36] (see (a.9))

si(z, ~x) =

(2k)

a3(2k  3)z d~x (cid:18)

z

z2 + |~x  ~x|(cid:19)2k

0(~x).
si

(b.4)

for this it is convenient to use a prescription that was found useful in [30]. we note that
the leading singularities in 1/|~x  ~x| arise from terms which do not have derivatives with

23

respect to the boundary acting on si. furthermore, terms with z-derivatives acting on
the denominator of the boundary-to-bulk greens function are also subleading. as only a

conformal structure is dened on the boundary of ads, the induced metric on the boundary
is dened by rescaling by a power of z  0. after this rescaling, these subleading terms
will vanish as the boundary is approached. therefore, we only need to compute the surface

terms which involve

zsi  2ksi/z
2
z si  2k(2k  1)si/z2.

(b.5)

we use  to indicate that terms which vanish in the limit that z  0 have been dropped,
but the numerical coecients are precise.

we nd that

so that

(sisi)  4k2(sisi)

(sisi)  8k2(2k2 + 3)(sisi),

l[si] = 

9(2k + 3)z(k)

128k

2n 3
5 (sisi).

(b.6)

(b.7)

this is the same result that we would have obtained from a canonical lagrangian (with no

higher derivatives)

l[si ] = 

ai

ai =

128k

2 (cid:2)(si)2 + 4k(k  3)(si)2(cid:3),

9(2k + 3)z(k)

2n 3
5 .

(b.8)

unfortunately, this normalization is inconsistent with the value (3.28) obtained from the

equations of motion of the theory at second order. in fact, it is obvious that the k-dependence

of this result is completely incompatible with the totally symmetric form of the s-s-s vertex

we obtain from (3.31).

this procedure is also inconsistent in the case of ads5  s5. while we reproduce the
result (3.22) (the higher derivative lagrangian) of [24], when we evaluate it as a function of

boundary values using the appropriate versions of the formul (b.2) and (b.6), we recover

a(ads5)

i

= 32k(k + 2)z(k),

(b.9)

which diers by a factor of (k  1)/(k + 1) from the result quoted as eq. (3.23) of [24].
nevertheless, the k-dependence of the result reported there is certainly correct, as it led to

the cyclic symmetry of the 3-point vertex there.

24

we conclude that this method of evaluating the quadratic action is awed.

the authors of [39] note that it is conventional to supplement the einstein-hilbert action

with boundary terms involving the second fundamental form of the metric g as well as

the metric induced on the boundary [40, 41, 15, 42, 43]. in our case, the contribution of the

standard extrinsic curvature term can be easily computed and its addition to the action

above does not result in a correct normalization.

the motivation of [41] (see an extended discussion in [44]) to add the extrinsic curvature

term was to remove terms in the einstein-hilbert action that were linear in second deriva-

tives. as mentioned in [42, 43], this occurs for the physical graviton because certain terms

in the einstein-hilbert action vanish if an appropriate gauge choice is made. here we are

dealing with the action for scalars that arises from the supergravity action and the terms in

question cannot be made to vanish. therefore adding the extrinsic curvature term does not

cancel all of the boundary terms in the action for the scalar modes.

another motivation for adding boundary terms will arise from supersymmetry. the su-

pergravity action is supersymmetric up to total derivative terms, so we should expect that

additional boundary terms must be added via the noether procedure to restore supersym-
metry on a space with boundary3. the process of nding all such terms seems to be a much
more dicult procedure than the method we use in the text, so we will not attempt to do

that here.

despite these remarks, the authors of [39] seem to obtain the correct normalization for
the si action in the case of ads5  s5. applying what we understand their methods to be
did not result in the correct normalization for ads7  s4.

d. spherical harmonics on s4

here we collect some results about the spherical harmonics on s4, following the appendix
of [24]. we take the radius of the sphere to be 1/2, as in the text. we embed the s4  r5
and represent the spherical harmonics by

y i = c i

i1ik xi1    xik ,

28

(d.1)

where we normalize c i1

i1ikc i2 i1ik = i1i2. for each k, there are

n(k) = (2k + 3)(k + 2)(k + 1)/6

(d.2)

harmonics and the eigenvalues of the spherical harmonics on a sphere of radius 1/2 are given

by

y i = 4k(k + 3)y i.

(d.3)

integrals over products of spherical harmonics are facilitated by the use of the formula

where 4 = 82/3 and the permutations are computed in the following manner: x the rst
index, then perform (2m1) cyclic permutations, then, for each of the terms thus generated,
x the rst three indices and perform (2m 3) cyclic permutations, etc. we nd the integral
formul

y i1y i2 = z(k)i1i2,
