abstract

in this paper we study t-duality for open strings ending on branes with non-zero

b-eld on them from the point of view of canonical transformations. for the particular

case of type ii strings on the two torus we show that the sl(2, z)n transformations

can be understood as a sub-class of canonical transformations on the open strings in

the b-eld background.

introduction

recently noncommutative geometry has been shown to be relevant to d-branes in the con-

stant b-eld background [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. in [1], it was conjectured that a light cone formulation

of m-theory with the non-zero constant 3-from background on a three torus is given by the
sym on noncommutative two torus, t 2
 , and, considering this background is crucial to re-
cover the u-duality group of m-theory on t 3, sl(3, z)  sl(2, z)n , where the deformation
parameter of the noncommutative torus , , plays the role of sl(2, z)n metric in the zero
volume limit.

in a string theoretic discussion it was shown that quantizing the open strings with the

mixed boundary conditions, the coordinates of end points of such open strings, xi, which
live on a d-brane with a non-zero b-eld background are really noncommuting [3, 6, 7] and:

[xi, xj] = 2i (cid:16)b(1  b2)1(cid:17)ij

.

(1)

besides the noncommutative structure, it was shown that the t-duality group of type
ii theories on t 2, so(2, 2; z) can be written as sl(2, z)  sl(2, z)n , where the rst is the
mapping class group of the torus and the second acts on the kahler moduli of the torus

[3, 4].

on the other hand there have been many suggestions in literature trying to explain t-

duality as particular canonical transformations [8, 9, 10]. this idea was initially studied for

the closed strings in general backgrounds and was extended to the open strings with dirichlet

boundaries, d-branes. however the case of d-brane bound states, i.e. , open strings ending

on the branes with non-zero b-eld [11] has not been elaborated on well.

in this note we will study the behaviour of open strings with dierent boundary conditions

under the proper canonical transformations and show that the sl(2, z)n part of t-duality
is really a sub-class of these canonical transformations.

open string in b-eld backgrounds

we start with the usual -model action describing the open strings in b-eld backgrounds:

s = 1

4 r d2[ ax bx gab + abb ax bx  + 1

2 h d ai  i,

(2)

where a, is the u(1) gauge eld living on the d-brane and  i its internal coordinates. the
action is invariant under the combined gauge transformation [2]

b  b +   

a  a  .

2

(3)

the gauge invariant eld strength is then

f = b  f

, f = [a].

(4)

so we can always choose  so that f = b, and hereafter we will work in this gauge.

variation of the action s, leads to the following mixed boundary conditions

or in terms of the conjugate canonical momenta, p:

x  + f 

  x  = 0.

with

x  + f p = 0,

f = (f (1  f 2)1).

(5)

(6)

(7)

since we will mostly consider the compactications of x 1 and x 2 directions on two torus,
for simplicity we assume that all the f components except f12 = f to be zero and in this
case 

f =  f,

f =

f

.

1 + f 2

f is the deformation parameter of the noncommutative tours.

let us return to the question of canonical transformations . it is well known that, al-

though the canonical transformations do not change the equations of motion, they alter the

boundary conditions and hence in our case we expect the boundary conditions, or equiva-

lently the parameter f , to be changed with canonical transformations. but, we will momen-

tarily show that for any linear canonical transformation one can nd a transformed f , so

that the form of the boundary conditions remain invariant. this argument can be justied

as follows: boundary conditions can be treated as the constraints which are of second class

[12] and hence the canonical transformations are those under which the dirac brackets are

invariant. the above requirement is satised if we also transform f in a proper way.

since we are interested in the two torus case, we consider the canonical transformations

which reproduce the sl(2, z)n

a)

if we consider the torus radii, r1 and r2, we nd f = f

v 2+f 2 , where v = r1r2.

together with 

xi  xi =  r  pid

pi  pi = xi,

i = 1, 2 ,




f  f =

f

.

(8)

(9)

one can easily show that the above transformations do not change the form of equations of

motion and the boundary conditions,

x  + f  p = 0   x  +  f  p = 0.

in other words under the above transformations the dirac bracket introduced in [7, 12] are

invariant. it is worth noting that the above transformations are exactly the same as the

transformations introduced in [8] for the closed strings.

b)

xi  xi = xi + ij r  pjd

pi  pi = pi,

i = 1, 2 ,




(10)

together with the proper metric transformations (the usual t-duality transformations), and
the f  f = f + 1, are also the symmetry of the open string action in the same sense as the
case a).

as we see the sl(2, z)n transformations which act on the kahler structure of the torus,
 = iv + f , can be generated by the transformations on canonical variables and also the f ,
background eld. all the above arguments can easily be generalized to the case of t n.

concluding remarks

in this note we showed that the idea of treating t-duality group of the perturbative closed

string theories (type ii strings) as canonical transformations of the -model can be extended

to the strong couplings, using the fact that at strong coupling type ii theories are pertur-

batively governed by the open strings ending on the d-branes and their bound states. in

this case although the open string boundary conditions (or equivalently the brane structure

 for the case of the torus we should take  to r2

i and the metric is changed as the usual t-dualities.

4

we have) change under canonical transformations, we argued that by a proper change of pa-

rameters we can make our theory to be invariant under such transformations, which exactly

lead to the sl(2, z)n part of the expected t-duality group. on the other hand it has been
argued that this duality can be realized as the morita equivalence of the noncommutative

gauge bundles governing the low energy eective theory of the open strings we considered

here. so it is an interesting question to study morita equivalence in the light of canonical

transformations.

one can address the same procedure in the path integral formulation too. in the path

integral, canonical transformations are translated to changing the operators by similarity

transformations. this point of view has recently been used for quantizing the discretized

m2-branes in a three from eld background [13]. in this picture t (or u)-duality is given

by a special class of the unitary transformations which are characterized by c-eld. this

question from the string theory point of view can be understood through the dvv [14] string

matrix theory.
