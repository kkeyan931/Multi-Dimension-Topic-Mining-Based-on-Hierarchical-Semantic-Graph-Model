d-branes on k3-fibrations

theory division, cern, geneva, switzerland

abstract

b-type d-branes are constructed on two dierent k3-brations over
ip1 using boundary conformal eld theory at the rational gepner points
of these models. the microscopic cft charges are compared with the
ramond charges of d-branes wrapped on holomorphic cycles of the cor-
responding calabi-yau manifold. we study in particular d4-branes and
bundles localized on the k3 bers, and nd from cft that each irreducible
component of a bundle on k3 gains one modulus upon bration over ip1.
this is in agreement with expectations and so provides a further test of
the boundary cft approach to d-brane physics.

1. introduction

in the large radius region of moduli space, strings can be viewed as moving in
a xed extrinsic background space-time whose geometry is determined by the closed
string sector of the theory itself; in particular it must be a calabi-yau (cy) space. at
string tree level these classical geometric data and some of the quantum corrections
are encoded in n = 2 superconformal eld theory on the plane, hereafter called bulk
cft. at special points in its moduli space the cft is rational and can therefore
be exhaustively studied using gepners construction. the complementary viewpoints
provided by the intrinsic, microscopic cft picture, and the extrinsic, macroscopic
cy sigma-model, have provided a wealth of information about the closed string sec-
tor, most notably the phenomenon of mirror symmetry, amounting to a profound
redirection of our thinking about the structure of space-time at small scales.

our understanding of the open string sector is currently undergoing a parallel
evolution which may ultimately provide a similar redirection of our thinking about
the gauge structure of the theory. indeed, a major eort is currently underway to
extend the mirror map to the gauge bundles that may decorate various cycles in cy
manifolds (see e.g., [1,2]).

for the open string sector the appropriate microscopic description is provided
by boundary conformal eld theory on the upper half plane (bcft), and the corre-
sponding macroscopic objects are d-branes wrapped on cycles of the cy target spaces
embodied in the closed string sector. since open strings can end on d-branes, these
should be intimately related to the boundary states of the (microscopic) bcft. in
fact they are supposedly nothing but manifestations of the boundary states at large
radii of the compactication manifold, where naive geometrical concepts apply. on
the other hand, at small radii instanton corrections can swamp out any classical pic-
ture, to an extent where the very notion of space-time, as well as the vector bundles
it supports, evaporates.

however, it is conceivable that the microscopic bcft still encodes some of the
geometric information pertaining to the d-branes at large radii, like the intersection
properties of the cycles around which they wrap. this can be tested at the gepner
points in moduli space where the theory is exactly solvable, and thus opens a window
on d-brane physics in a regime where quantum corrections are strong. this approach
has been pioneered in refs. [36], building on earlier work, for example [710].

 1 

our purpose in this letter is to apply the methods developed in these papers
to study properties of d-branes on k3-brations. the motivation is twofold. first,
k3-brations are important in the context of heterotic-type ii duality [11], and their
quantum algebraic geometry is well understood.
in particular, for some cases the
periods, monodromy and analytic continuation to gepner points are either directly
available from the literature [12], or can be obtained with a reasonable amount of
eort. second, for generic threefolds the quantum corrections at the gepner point
are strong, and for some states [3-6] there is no good match between bctf data at
the gepner point and geometrical d-brane data at large radii  for these cases it may
not always be clear whether the quantum geometries really dier so much, or whether
the method fails. however, for k3 brations we may expect that some quantities
are protected by non-renormalization properties of the k3, while the whole theory is
not as trivial as if we would be looking just at an isolated k3. therefore, studying
k3-brations might not only oer new insights in d-brane physics at small radii, but
also provide further tests of the validity of the bcft method.

in sect. 2, we review the bcft approach at the gepner point of generic n-folds,
but also improve and clarify some steps in the papers [3-6]. where our work overlaps,
we are in agreement, and we explain why this is so. in sect. 3 we then discuss some
basic d-geometric features of the two k3-brations we study.
in section four, we
compare the bcft and the geometrical data, producing lists of d-brane charges that
correspond to the cft boundary states. finally, in sect. 4 we discuss some features
of these data and nd agreement with expectations.

2. gepner models and boundary conformal eld theory

the gepner construction is a gso-projected tensor product of r minimal models
at levels ki, whose central charges ci = 3ki/(ki +2) add up to 3n (n = 1, 2, 3, . . .), suit-
ably twisted to enforce modular invariance of the partition function. an explicit con-
nection with the geometric data at large radius is provided by the landau-ginzburg
representation of minimal models, provided that the tensor product is extended by a
trivial factor kr+1 = 0 when n + r is odd. let k = lcm{h1, . . . , hr}, where hi = ki + 2
are called the heights of the minimal models. the wi = k/hi will here be called the
(relative) weights of the minimal models in the given product. since k is even when
n + r is odd, hr+1 = 2 is automatically a divisor of k and the weight of the trivial
extension is wr+1 = k/2. the smooth cy n-fold is then obtained by desingularizing

 2 

the degree k quasi-homogeneous hypersurface in the weighted projective space of
dimension dim(w)  1 with scaling weights wi.

we consider here only the two gepner models 102420/zz12 = 1010440/zz12
and 6223/zz8. by the above algorithm, the rst model contains the cy manifold which
is dened classically by resolving the singularities of a quasi-homogeneous polynomial
hypersurface of total degree 12 in a four-dimensional projective space weighted by
(1, 1, 2, 2, 6), hereafter denoted ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 6)[12] for short. the second one contains
the geometric data for a degree 8 projective variety, denoted ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 2)[8] for short.
both these varieties are k3-brations over ip1. their quantum geometry has been
extensively investigated using mirror symmetry [12,13], and we will draw heavily on
this information.

open string states satisfying neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions are built
from generalized coherent states (ishibashi states) of a boundary conformal eld the-

ory. the coherent basis |iii = pn |i, ni  u|i, ni is obtained by tracing over the

modules labeled by the primary elds |ii = |i, 0i. the operator u=a,b selects so-
called a- or b-type states by enforcing charge relations between the left and right
sectors. acceptable string states must satisfy cardys modular consistency condi-
tions, in this case on the annulus. for a-type states cardys solutions ||iiia =

mal models at height h (whose primary elds are labelled |ii = |l, m, si), are simple

pj sij/(s0j)1/2|jiia apply. they are built from the s-matrices, which for mini-
trigonometric functions, whose su (2)k part is just sl,l =p2/h sin((l+1)(l +1)/h).

the construction can be adapted to b-type states by restricting the sum to run over
labels appropriate for this case, and extended to gepner models by tensoring such
minimal model states [7,8]. consequently, every detail about these classes of ratio-
nal boundary states in gepner models is known. a- and b-type boundary states
||lm sii are labeled by vectors l, m of su (2) quantum numbers from the minimal
models in the tensor product, as well as a vector s which distinguishes the ns- and
r-elds. we shall return to the classication of boundary states in gepner mod-
els elsewhere, since this will be important in establishing a complete correspondence
between non-perturbative string theory and the geometry of d-branes in cy spaces.

the microscopic version of the intersection numbers in classical geometry should
be overlap integrals (open string amplitudes) between boundary states ||lm sii
[3] these can be computed by evaluating the

coecients in a formal but natural way (compatible with the verlinde formula) so that
they become periodic over the extended range of labels. by virtue of the properties
of the s-matrices and the verlinde formula we have

but with half the period in the -function and an additional sign factor.

gepner models enjoy a large group of discrete symmetries which play a funda-
mental role in both the structure of the cft and its geometrical limits. since the
intersection matrices are computed at the gepner points they inherit many of these
symmetries. this can be exploited to give a much simpler representation of the inter-
section matrix in terms of two (highly reducible) representations of the abelian group

1. for xed values of l,el the intersection form can be regarded as a matrix with
rows and columns labelled by fm and m . when n + r is even we nd that i b is most

simply expressed as a polynomial in g = +(2k)2, while when n + r is odd we nd
that i b is most simply expressed as a polynomial in g = (k)2. introducing the
notation gj = gwj and the fundamental step-operators from ref. [6],

tlj = tt

lj =

it is possible to prove [6] that the nasty looking expression for i be displayed above
reduces to:

(1  g1

j ).

(6)

we nd exactly the same form also for the odd case, even if the representation in-
volving  is used. the particular representation of the intersection form chosen here
emerges naturally from the bcft, through the doubling trick for fusion coecients
described above, but it is highly redundant. there are many non-trivial relations
between the set of boundary states ||lm siib, and this is reected in the redundancy
encoded in i b. similarly, the boundary state itself is redundantly labelled by m , or
equivalently the u (1) charges qj = mj/h of the minimal model states from which it is
built. for the spinless sector we write: ||qiib = ||l = 0; qiib, while higher spin states

(not all independent) are again given by the step-operators: ||l; qiib =qj tlj ||qiib.

the number of moduli of these boundary states are also given by the (extended)

fusion coecients [3]

where subtracting  compensates for the counting of vacuum states. if n + r is odd,
 = 2, where  is the number of ljs equal to kj/2 [6]. however, if n + r is even, we
nd that  = 21 when  > 0, and  = 1 if  = 0. hence if all kj are odd,  is always
equal to one.

note that from a cft point of view we are free to extend the tensor product
with trivial (kj = 0) factors, if we so desire. thus, although (k)2 provides the
simplest and most obvious representation when n + r is odd, we can also work in the

 5 

n + r + 1 even channel where computing the intersection form and number of moduli
requires appending a factor of p(g) = (1 gk/2)/2, appropriate for a minimal model
with no central charge. since p+(g) and p(g) are (orthogonal) projection operators
the number of such factors is immaterial. this appears to be the reason why the
calculations reported in [6] are correct. as already explained, it is the even channel
which oers the most direct down-link to geometry. it is a useful consistency check to
compare results from computations in both channels, and we indeed found agreement.

we now want to transport the cft data, in particular the charges of the b-type
boundary states, to large radius points on the boundary of moduli space, where they
can be compared with the ramond charges of d-branes wrapping cycles of large cy
manifolds. this can not be done without specifying some geometric data which select
a cy space.

3. bundle data and brane charges

we summarize the relevant d-brane geometry for the k3-brations under exam-
ination here. ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 2)[8] has been analyzed in great detail using mirror symme-
try in ref. [12], who also discussed ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 6)[12] in somewhat less detail; further
explicit properties of the latter were worked out in ref. [13]. for each of the two com-
pactications the n = 2 special geometry is encoded in a prepotential whose classical
part can be written in the form:

f (t1, t2) = 

1
3!

c111t1

3 

1
2

c112t1

2t2 +

1
24

(b1t1 + b2t2) + const.,

(8)

where t1 and t2 parametrize the complexied kahler cone: k = t1j1 + t2j2. here
j1 and j2 are the kahler classes of the k3-ber and ip1 base, respectively.  the
coecients are given in terms of the following topological intersections:

cijk = z ji  jj  jk ,

bi = z c2(x)  ji , i = 1, 2.

for the threefolds at hand, we have [12]:

ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 6)[12] :

c111 = 4, c112 = 2, b1 = 52, b2 = 24

ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 2)[8] :

c111 = 8, c112 = 4, b1 = 56, b2 = 24

(9)

(10)

 more precisely, j1 = 2l + e and j2 = l, where e is an exceptional divisor coming from

blowing up a curve of singularities, and the linear system |l| is a pencil of k3s.

 6 

from the prepotential one derives the symplectic period vector   (f0  2f 
tiif , f1, f2, 1, t1, t2)t, which for ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 6)[12] reads:

 =

6  2t1

3 + t2 + t1
2  2 t1 t2

2

1
t1
t2





(11)

the entries (from the top down) correspond to integrations over 6, 4, 4, 0, 2
and 2cycles, respectively.

we now want to obtain an explicit map between the topological invariants of
k-theory (characteristic classes of the chan-paton sheaf v ), and brane charges. the
latter are dened as the coecients of the n = 2 central charge given by

z(ni) = n6 f0 + n1

4 f1 + n2

4 f2 + n0 + n1

2t1 + n2

2t2 .

(12)

following ref. [6], the topological invariants can be obtained by comparing this to the
central charge of a d-brane conguration

z(q(v )) = z ek  q = z ek  tr(ef ) qba(x) ,

(13)

where q = (r, c1(v ), ch2(v ) + r
24 c1(v )c2(x))  h 2(x) is the
mukai vector of eective brane charges [14,15]. specically, r is the rank of the
bundle and chi(v ) are its chern characters. inserting the classical periods (11) and
substituting the values of the intersections given in (10), equating (12) and (13) yields:

24 c2(x), ch3(v ) + 1

r = n6 ,

c1(v ) =

(14)

where h = 1

2 j1  j2 and  = 1

2 j1  j1  j1  j2.

we will be mainly interested in d-branes wrapping the k3-ber (called ber
4 = n2
2 = 0,
[6] that the

branes in ref. [15]). this corresponds to considering only states with n1
and accordingly we will set n4  n2

2. it follows from ref.

4 and n2  n1

 7 

topological invariants of the torsion sheaf v supported on the k3-ber can be written
in terms of its extension iv to the threefold as:

q = (0, r j2, ic1(v ), ich2(v ) + r) .

(15)

that the vector of induced charges takes this naive form is a consequence of the
triviality of the normal bundle, c1(k3) = 0, and c2(k3) = 24; otherwise, there would
be extra correction terms. comparing the central charges as before, we thus obtain a
simple truncation of (14):

r = n4 ,

ic1(v ) = n2 h ,

ich2(v ) = n0  2n4 .

(16)

we are particularly interested in the dimensions of the moduli spaces m of
d-brane congurations on the k3-ber. unlike for threefolds, for an isolated k3
such dimensions (for irreducible bundles) are completely determined by the mukai
vector [16]:

k3(q)  dimcm(q) = hq, qi + 2 .

(17)

to write this in terms of the brane charges ni, we need to know what the precise form
of the inner product in (17) is. for this, note that the intersection form of the k3-ber
is easily exhibited by transforming the periods (11) in the t2   limit to a more
2)t. the symplectic intersection

(18)

accordingly, the mukai charge vector on k3 takes the form qk3 = (r, c1(v ), ch2(v )+
r) = (n4, n2, n0  n4), whence:

k3(ni) = 2 +

2 + 2n0n4 + 2n4

(19)

analogously, for the threefold ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 2)[8] we nd that the intersection form
on the ber is half of the one given in (18), and qk3 = (2r, c1(v ), ch2(v ) + r) =
(2n4, n2, n0  n4). we therefore get in this case:

k3(ni) = 2 +

4. matching of geometric and bcft data

we now relate the bcft data of sect. 2 to the geometrical data of the previous
section. this rst of all involves an analytic continuation of the large-radius periods
(11) to the gepner point, i.e. z = ~n  ~ = (~ng m1)  (m ~g). the continuation
matrix m is path dependent and thus only dened up to sp(6, zz) monodromy trans-
formations. it is most natural to choose, similar to the case in refs. [12,6], a preferred
basis such that the conifold singularity corresponds to a single wrapped d6-brane.

by applying the method for analytic continuation described in ref.

[12] to the
threefold ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 6)[12], we nd after some work that for our choice of periods
(11) the continuation matrix takes the form

m =

the geometric intersection form in the gepner basis is therefore:

(23)

and an expression for i g similar to (22).

 note that we use a basis dierent to the one of ref.

[12]; moreover, we found that there are

some typing errors in their monodromy matrices.

 9 

since there is no way the bcft can know how we will choose the continuation

path for a given large-radius endpoint threefold, the monodromy basis selected by

the above construction of boundary states need not be the same as the gepner basis

associated with our choice of m. a further change of basis is necessary to link the

bcft boundary state charges to the geometrical charges at the gepner point. the

precise form of the required transformation can be determined by comparing the

geometric intersection matrix at the gepner point (22) with the projection of the

li = 0 bcft intersection matrix (1), (3) onto the non-redundant basis.

in all cases studied in refs.

[3,6] and by us so far, it turns out that i b is to be

compared with (1  g)t i gt t(1  g)t, where t is the appropriate intertwining matrix.

taking everything together, the geometric brane congurations |nii are given in
terms of the boundary cft charges by |nii = (m1)t t t(1  g)t||l; qiib, where ni

can be thought of as functions of the bcft labels {l; q}.

what we nd for the two models considered here are lists of charges that are

similar to those of ref. [6]. indeed a similar bundle interpretation can be given for

some of them, however in order not to be repetitious, we refrain from presenting this

here. there are also certain states, like the one with charges (1, 2, 0), for which there

is no conventional bundle interpretation, and this is analogous to the ndings of [3].

the major dierence of our work and ref. [6] is that we deal with k3-brations

rather than elliptic brations. we will thus focus here on the brane features which are

specic to k3 brations, and in particular on brane congurations supported on the

k3 ber. tables 1 and 2 list all brane states we have found within this construction

that have n6 = n1

4 = n2

2 = 0, together with some of their essential characteristics.

5. discussion

the data in tables 1 and 2 provide support for the conjectured equivalence of

boundary states and d-branes. we conne ourselves here to the following remarks.

i) the entries of each row belong to the same zzk orbit (which also contains other
states not localized only on the k3 ber that we dont show). they thus have the
same properties with regard to the moduli space, even though the brane charges can
be very dierent. all charges satisfy the bps condition [15] hqk3, qk3i  2, with
r > 0 or r = 0, c1 > 0 or r = c1 = 0, ch2(v )  1

2  c2 < 0. 1

2 c1

ii) consider the charge vectors of the form qk3 = (r, c2, 0), which can be interpreted
as su (r) bundles with c1 = 0. for such bundles c2 must obey c2  2r. we indeed
nd, as a rst consistency test, that for all such charges, c2 is equal to 2r, except
for r = 2 where we nd in addition also c2 = r. however, this can be given an
interpretation as an so(3) bundle instead of su (2), so all is well.

iii) more interestingly, note that for boundary states with one vacuum ( = 1 in (7)),
the number of cft moduli is one larger than the number of classical k3 moduli:  
b
l  k3 = 1. this is indeed exactly as expected from geometrical considerations:
the brane system should gain a modulus from the one-dimensional base space (ip1
here) when it is embedded as a ber in a threefold.

iv) on the other hand, if the number of cft vacua gets larger,  > 1, there is a
growing discrepancy between the numbers of threefold bcft moduli and classical k3
moduli. however, as suggested in [6], such boundary states may describe not single
branes but collections of several branes, and this would correspond to reducible bun-
dles or sheaves. for such bundles the geometry of the moduli space is more intricate
than for irreducible ones, as the relative positions of the congurations correspond to
coulomb branches of additional moduli [17].

by studying the tables one nds consistency between the charge vectors and the
values of . that is, congurations with  > 1 can be decomposed into congurations
with smaller i, in a way such that i and the charges add up correctly.  for example,
the congurations with charges (2, 2k, 0), k = 1, 2 have  = 2, and indeed can be
2(l), c1(l)). these correspond
decomposed [17] into two branes with charges (1, 1
2(l) = 2k.
to reducible bundles of the form ll1, where l are line bundles with c1

charges, cf. eq. (16).

 details will be discussed elsewhere.

the higgs branches of these u (1)  u (1) theories happen to coincide [17] with the
moduli spaces of su (2) bundles with charges (2, 2k, 0). this illustrates that the
charge label alone does not completely specify the conguration, rather it is  that
tells that we have a reducible u (1)  u (1) bundle rather than an su (2) bundle
(however, these congurations are continuously connected, so that a distinction is
not fundamentally important.) in contrast, the conguration (3, 6, 0) in table 1 is
irreducible because  = 1. therefore it corresponds to an su (3) bundle with no
coulomb branch.

some interesting observations can also be made by comparing both tables: for a
given number  of cft vacuum states, we nd that the number of excess moduli  is
always the same. for example, the state with charges (4, 4, 8) has 44 cft moduli
on ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 6)[12], which is 10 more than what the mukai formula gives for the k3
alone. on the other hand, it has 28 moduli  on ip(1, 1, 2, 2, 2)[8], which is again 10
more than one would have for the corresponding k3.

the point is that while the absolute numbers of moduli may dier, the excess
number of moduli coming from the bration is universal and given by   = 3  2.
this can be given the following interpretation. from index theorems we know that

k3 = nm  2(ng  1), where nm = 2rr c2 is the number of matter elds in six

dimensions and ng is the total number of gauge elds. for an irreducible bundle
we have ng = dimg + 1, where the shift by one is due to the u (1) factor that
corresponds to the overall center-of-mass modulus of the brane conguration [3]. for
a reducible bundle, which corresponds to a collection of branes, we have several center-
of-mass moduli and thus ng = dimg + nu(1), where nu(1) is equal to the number
of irreducible components. hence we can identify nu(1) =  and express the excess
number of moduli as:

  b

l  k3 = b

= (cid:16)b
=: e + 2(  1) .

l  (nm  2(ng  1))

l  (nm  2dimg)(cid:17) + 2(  1)

(24)

 note that the two k3s have dierent intersection forms, so the mukai formulas (19) and (20)

yield dierent numbers of moduli.

 this is a general property of the bcft, as will be shown elsewhere.

 13 

the second term may be thought of as a correction to the mukai formula k3 =

2rr c2  2dimg, taking into account that we have a reducible bundle if  > 1. a

comparison with the cft result  = 3  2 then yields

e =

xirreducible
components e(i) =  ,

(25)

which means that each irreducible component of the k3 bundle or sheaf gains one
extra modulus upon bration  which is precisely as expected ! this is because
each such component corresponds to an independent brane conguration that can sit
anywhere over the ip1 base.

concluding, we note that there is a high degree of consistency and universality
in our results. we therefore believe that these provide a successful test of the bcft
approach to d-branes.

our ndings suggest in particular that the moduli space of the k3 remains pro-
tected even when embedded in a threefold with less supersymmetries, and its dimen-
sion is still given by the mukai formula (17), if we subtract the degrees of freedom
associated with the bration over the ip1 base. while this robustness may not be
too surprising in an adiabatic, large base limit of the threefold, it is more impressive
here as we look into a region of the threefold moduli space (the gepner point) where
the classical geometry is maximally distorted by quantum corrections. it appears that
nothing serious happens to the branes supported on the k3-ber at large radius when
we transport them all the way to the gepner point of the cy moduli space. one may
argue that there is an n = 4 subsector in the n = 2 bcft that protects these states
from instanton corrections also in the non-geometric regime.
