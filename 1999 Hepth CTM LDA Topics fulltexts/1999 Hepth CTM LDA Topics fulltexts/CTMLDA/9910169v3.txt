abstract: we re-examine the graceful exit problem in the pre-big bang scenario
of string cosmology, by considering the most general time-dependent classical correc-
tion to the lagrangian with up to four derivatives. by including possible forms for
quantum loop corrections we examine the allowed region of parameter space for the
coupling constants which enable our solutions to link smoothly the two asymptotic
low-energy branches of the pre-big bang scenario, and observe that these solutions
can satisfy recently proposed entropic bounds on viable singularity free cosmologies.

1. introduction

it is generally accepted that standard cosmology provides a consistent picture of
the evolution of the universe from the period of primordial nucleosynthesis to the
present. however, as we extrapolate further into the past, our knowledge becomes
less certain as we appear to be inevitably led to an initial curvature singularity [1].
the emergence of string theory as the favoured candidate to unify the forces of nature
has led a number of authors to investigate the cosmology associated with it (for a
recent review see [2]). one such approach has been pioneered by veneziano and his
collaborators, and employs the rich duality properties present in string theory [3, 4, 5,
6], and leads to a class of solutions which eectively talk about a period before the big
bang, the pre-big bang scenario [6, 7]. the universe expands from a weak coupling,
low curvature regime in the innite past, enters a period of ination driven by the
kinetic energy associated with the massless elds present, before approaching the
strong coupling regime as the string scale is reached. there is then a branch change
to a new class of solutions, corresponding to a post big bang decelerating friedman-
robertson-walker era. in such a scenario, the universe appears to emerge because of
the gravitational instability of the generic string vacua [8, 9]. in many ways this is a
very appealing picture, the weak coupling, low curvature regime is a natural starting
point to use the low energy string eective action. however, there are a number of
problems facing the scenario. one is that of initial conditions, why should such a

1

large universe be a natural initial state to emerge from and does it possess enough
ination before entering the strong coupling regime [10, 11, 8]? the second is how can
the dilaton eld be stabilised in the post big bang phase? it must be decoupled from
the expansion since variations in this scalar eld correspond to changes in masses
and coupling constants, which are strongly constrained by observation [12, 13]. a
number of attempts have been made to do this; by including dilaton self-interaction
potentials and trapping the dilaton in a potential minimum[14] and by taking into
account the back-reaction on the dilaton eld from quantum particle production [15].
the third is the graceful exit problem. how can the curvature singularity associated
with the strong coupling regime be avoided, so as to allow a smooth branch change
between the pre-big bang inationary solution and a decelerating post big bang
frw solution? the simplest version of the evolution of the universe in the pre-big
bang scenario inevitably leads to a period characterised by an unbounded curvature.
no-go theorems prevent the inclusion of a single potential to catalyse a graceful
exit in vacuum-dilaton cosmology [16, 17, 18], although ellis et al. recently claimed
that non-singular evolutions can be obtained through the inclusion of a single scalar
potential providing the use of an exotic equation of state [19]. the current philosophy
is to include higher-order corrections to the string eective action. these include both
classical nite size eects of the strings, and quantum string loop corrections and have
already met with some success [20, 15, 21, 22]. the eect of backreaction arising
from long wavelength modes, where string theory should be adequately described by
general relativity with a minimally coupled scalar eld, conrms that the qualitative
eect of these corrections is compatible with an evolution leading towards exit [23].
the motivation behind this paper is to investigate the graceful exit issue by
studying in detail a physically motivated action at both the classical and quantum
level which can incorporate a number of appealing features, such as being able to
maintain scale factor duality (sfd), even when these higher order corrections are
included.

the classical corrections to the low energy eective string action usually have
associated with them xed points where the hubble parameter in the string frame is
constant and the dilaton is growing [20]. we will see that although physically very
appealing, the sfd invariant action does not drive the evolution of the universe into
a good xed point (in agreement with brustein and madden [24]), and moreover the
inclusion of quantum corrections do not lead to a smooth exit into the decelerating
frw branch, rather they lead to a regime of instability. fortunately, relaxing the
sfd condition leads to many interesting features: the loop corrections introduce an
upper (lower) bound for the curvature in the string (einstein) frame, suggesting that
a graceful exit is viable in this context, and indeed we present a number of successful
exits.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we discuss the eective low energy
action of the heterotic string including o() corrections arising from the nite size

2

eects. in section 3 we review previous studies of graceful exit using a truncated form
of these corrections and then make a comparison with the full classical correction.
a detailed analysis is presented showing the region of parameter space which admit
classical xed point solutions. we extend the analysis by including possible one- and
two-loop quantum corrections. as expected these turn out to be important in order
to obtain a successful graceful exit to the pre-big bang scenario [15, 24]. particle
creation is then used to stabilise the dilaton in the post-big bang era. finally in
section 4 we summarise our main results.

2. string eective action

the pre-big bang scenario is an inationary model starting with a generic state of
extremely weak coupling and curvature, pictured as a gravitational collapse in the
einstein frame. this rather trivial asymptotic past state is followed by a dilaton-
driven kinetic ination phase which has to be long enough to solve the dierent
cosmological problems inherent to standard cosmologies [8]. later on, this superin-
ationary period should be smoothly connected to the frw regime, characterised
by a decelerating expansion and a frozen or slowly evolving dilaton, whose present
expectation value gives rise to the universal gravitational constant.

we shall take as our starting point the minimal 4dimensional string eective

action:

1

(0) =

=

1

 z d4xgl(0)
 z d4xge2nr + 4()2o,
 = 

(2.1)

 + . . . and r = r

where we adopt the convention (, +, +, +), r

and set our units such that h = c = 16g = 1. by low-energy tree-level eective
action, we mean that the string is propagating in a background of small curvature
and the elds are weakly coupled. however, the evolution from the pre-big bang era
to the present is understood to be characterised by a regime of growing couplings and
curvature. this means that the universe will have to evolve through a phase when
the eld equations of this eective action are no longer valid. hence, the low-energy
dynamical description has to be supplemented by corrections in order to reliably
describe the transition regime.

the nite size of the string will have an impact on the evolution of the scale factor
when the curvature of the universe reaches a critical level, corresponding to the string

length scale s   (xed in the string frame), and such corrections are expected to

stabilise the growth of the curvature into a de-sitter like regime of constant curvature
and linearly growing dilaton [20, 15]. eventually the dilaton will play a major role,
and since the loop expansion is governed by powers of the string coupling parameter

3

gs = e, these quantum corrections will modify dramatically the evolution when
we reach the strong coupling region [15, 24]. this should correspond to the stage
when the universe completes a smooth transition to the post-big bang branch,
characterised by a xed value of the dilaton and a decelerating frw expansion.
one of the unresolved issues of the transition concerns whether or not the actual
exit takes place at large coupling, e  1. if it occurred whilst the coupling was still
small, then we would be happy to use the perturbative corrections we are adopting.
however, if the universe is driven into the strong coupling regime before the exit
proceeds then we might expect to have to adopt a dierent approach which involves
the use of non-perturbative string phenomena. such a possibility has recently been
proposed in the context of m-theory [21, 25].

the type of corrections we will be considering involve truncations of the classical
action at order . although a eld redenition mixing the dierent orders in  does
not change the physics if one considers all orders in , it inevitably leads to ambi-
guities when some orders are truncated. this means that the cosmological evolution
arising from such actions truncated at order  should really only be considered as
an indication of the possible cosmological behaviour. the most general form for a
correction to the string action up to fourth-order in derivatives has been presented
in refs [26, 27]:

require that it reproduces the usual string scattering amplitudes [28]. this constrains
the coecient of r2
 with the result that the pre-factor for the gauss-bonnet term
has to be a = 1. but the lagrangian can still be shifted by eld redenitions
which preserve the on-shell amplitudes, leaving the three remaining coecients of
the classical correction satisfying the constraint

2(b + c) + d = 16a.

(2.3)

there is as yet no denitive calculation of the full loop expansion of string
theory. this is of course a big problem if we want to try and include quantum
eects in analysing the graceful exit issue. the best we can do, is to propose plausible
terms that we hope are representative of the actual terms that will eventually make

4

up the loop corrections. we believe that the string coupling gs actually controls
the importance of string-loop corrections, so as a rst approximation to the loop
corrections we multiply each term of the classical correction by a suitable power
of the string coupling [15]. when loop corrections are included, we then have an
eective lagrangian given by

l = l(0) + l(c) + ae2l(c) + be4l(c),

(2.4)

where l(0) is given in eq. (2.1) and l(c) given in eq. (2.2). the constant parameters
a and b actually control the onset of the loop corrections.

3. numerical solutions

in this section, we consider the impact of both the classical and quantum corrections
of eq. (2.4). naively, we would expect that the latter should only become signicant
as we enter the strong coupling regime. depending on the value of the dilaton eld,
the loop corrections are indeed negligible in the weak coupling regime as the dilaton
  , so we expect that the solutions to the extended equations of motion should
initially be similar to the lowest-order description, with the classical and quantum
corrections introducing an upper bound for the solutions, thereby regulating their
singular behaviour.

following brustein and madden [15], we dene the parameters hs as the hubble
expansion in the string frame, he as the hubble expansion in the einstein frame
and  the derivative of the dilaton eld with respect to cosmic time, ts. hence, the
solutions to the equations of motion resulting from eq. (2.1) can be expressed as
2  = (3  3)hs, where the upper (lower) sign refers to the pre- (post-) big bang
solution. although starting in the perturbative regime, the (+) branch (hs > 0,
 > 0 and he < 0) evolves toward a curvature singularity, and the low-energy
eective description breaks down. more precisely, we expect modications to become
signicant when the curvature is of order the planck length s and the low-energy
eective action has to be replaced by one which includes higher-order eects in
. it has been known for some time that such classical corrections allow a branch
change (+)  (), which corresponds to a change of sign of the shifted dilaton,
    3hs/2 [29]. also, to allow a smooth connection to the usual decelerated

friedmann universe where the dilaton will become xed, the hubble rate in the
einstein frame has to become positive after the branch change. using the conformal
transformation relating the string frame to the einstein frame, ge
, the
hubble expansion in the e-frame can be expressed as a function of s-frame quantities,
he = e{hs  }. this relation allows us to dene the einstein bounce eb =
hs   = 0. a necessary condition to obtain a successful exit is the violation of the
null energy condition (nec) in the einstein frame, which is associated with the cross

 = e2gs

5

over of the einstein bounce[29]. thus we see that a number of dierent conditions
must be satised for a successful exit to be obtained. in the gures below, all these
constraints are presented as lines on the plots, i.e. the (+) and () branches of the
low energy string action, the branch change and the einstein bounce.

3.1 classical correction

we rst recall some aspects of the background evolution when we restrict ourselves
to the classical corrections. choosing initial conditions on the pre-big bang branch,
the equations of motion derived from eq. (2.1) and eq. (2.2) lead in general to a
regime of constant hubble parameter h and a linearly growing dilaton  > 0. this
is quantied in gure 1, where we show the dierent types of solutions that can be
found in the (c, d) plane, when we choose a = 1 and determine b from the constraint
eq. (2.3). the distribution of red dots corresponds to values of (c, d) which lead to
 > 0. the set of blue points (which
standard xed point solutions, h = const,
starts approximatively for c  12) also shows coecients leading to a xed point,
but with a hubble parameter, h  1. in particular we see that these points are
bordered by the lines d  1.68c + 3.62 and c  152/9, indicating that these represent
the constraints on c and d which have to be satised in order to obtain satisfactory
xed point solutions. it is clear that there exists a large region of parameter space
where such solutions are to be found. representing these xed points in the (2 , h)
plane emphasizes that for a constant c = 0 the xed point moves to smaller values

of | | and h when we increase the coecient d (green curve), whereas | | and h
both become larger when we increase c keeping constant d = 16 (blue curve). this
latter curve corresponds to a segment of the more general case b = c where the
asymptotic state in the high curvature regime is given by the implicit equation:

0 =

however, we will see later in the analysis that not all values of this curve of xed
points can be reached if the initial conditions are chosen on the pre-big bang branch.
the region to the right of the black line d  4c 44.62 in gure 1, represents the
range of coecients which lead to an evolution heading away from the   0 region.

the line was rst proposed by [24]. finally, the intermediate blank area represents
the combination of parameters driving the evolution into a regime of instability for
the scale factor, where a  . the emergence of such a region requires further
investigation.

we now go on to look at some particular examples including quantum loop

corrections.

figure 1: on the left, we have represented in the (c, d) plane the asymptotic state of
the evolution when the classical corrections are included, with a = 1 and the remaining
parameter b is constrained by eq. (2.3). the red dots show the combinations of these
parameters leading to a xed point, with saturated hubble parameter h = const and
a linearly growing dilaton. the black points indicate the set of coecients forcing the

evolution to head away from the   0 region. the black line represents the bound given
in [24]. the gure on the right shows the xed point distribution in the plane (2 , h). the
green line corresponds to a constant c = 0, whereas the red line stands for d = 16. the
cyan line shows the evolution for the sfd case with c = 4 and d = 16: the curve heads

away from the   0 region, typical of the black dots area in the gure on the left.

3.2 minimal case

the natural setting b = c = 0 leads to the well-known form which has given rise to
most of the studies on corrections to the low-energy picture. in references [20, 15], the
authors demonstrated that this minimal classical correction regularises the singular
behaviour of the low-energy pre-big bang scenario. it drives the evolution to a xed
point of bounded curvature with a linearly growing dilaton (the star in gure 2 
which agrees with the results of [20, 15]), suggesting that quantum loop corrections
-known to allow a violation of the null energy condition (p +  < 0)- would permit
the crossing of the einstein bounce to the frw decelerated expansion in the post-
big bang era. indeed, the addition of loop corrections leads to a () frw-branch
as pictured in gure 2. however, we still have to freeze the growth of the dilaton.
, where
following [15], we introduce by hand a particle creation term of the form 
 is the decay width of the  particle, in the equation of motion of the dilaton
eld and then coupling it to a uid with the equation of state of radiation in such
a way as to preserve overall conservation. this allows us to stabilise the dilaton in
the post-big bang era with a decreasing hubble rate, similar to the usual radiation
dominated frw cosmology.

conditions for the simulations have been set with respect to the lowest-order analytical
solutions at ts = 1000. the straight black lines describe the bounds quoted in section ii.
the dotted magenta line shows the impact of the classical correction due to the nite size of
the string. a  denotes the xed point. the contribution of the one-loop expansion is traced
with a dashed cyan line (a = 4). the dash-dotted blue line represents the incorporation of
the two-loop correction without the gauss-bonnet combination (b = 0.1). finally, the
green plain line introduces radiation with  = 0.08 and stabilises the dilaton.

3.3 scale factor duality case
in [26, 27], the authors considered the particular combination b = c = 16 which
has the remarkable property of introducing scale factor duality at the order  in
the correction to the low-energy action at the price of discarding non-sfd invariant
terms of higher order and making a modication to the denition of sfd at order
. unfortunately, as can be seen in gure 3, this choice of parameters does not
lead to a successful exit. the classical correction forces the curve to head away from
the branch changing and exit region. in fact even including loop corrections it is
impossible to reach the branch change, given in gure 3 by the line  = 0. such
an observation was previously also made in [24]. what appears to be happening
is that including the one-loop correction drives the system into a regime where the
acceleration of the scale factor (a) diverges. this is a singular point in the equation
of motion and is indicated by the star in gure 3. as discussed in [24], it may be
that working with higher orders in the corrections requires further alterations of the
form of sfd.

3.4 the general case

relaxing the sfd constraint allows us to investigate the full classical and quantum
correction up to four derivatives and leads to many interesting situations. when a =

the sfd case, with a = 1, b = c = 16 and d = 16. straight lines are identical to
those in gure 2. the classical correction makes the curve turn the wrong way (dotted
magenta). the inclusion of the one-loop correction (dashed) leads to a regime of instability:
the evolution meets the curve corresponding to a   (plain). two cases are explicitly
shown: a = 0.5 in blue and a = 16 in cyan, whereas the meeting points for other choices
of the pre-factor a are pictured with stars (*).

1 and d = 16, this implies that the coecient of the curvature-dilaton contribution
has the opposite sign to that of the 2()2 term. figure 4 shows the evolution
of the solution for b = c = 4. the xed point obtained by adding classical
corrections to the lowest-order action is well located as the evolution has already
reached the   0 region of the (h, ) phase space, indicating that generic loop
corrections will drive the evolution across the einstein bounce. indeed, setting a =
+4 we see that the evolution crosses the einstein bounce as well as the () branch.
this suggests that the violation of the nec is too large and will not give an upper
bound to the curvature in the einstein frame. an extra two-loop term is thus required
to instigate the transition to a decelerated expansion in the einstein frame. as shown
in gure 4 when such a term is included with b = 0.3, we obtain a successful
implementation of the graceful exit. once again, we invoke particle production in
order to eventually stabilise the dilaton in the usual frw cosmology.

an important issue concerns the sensitivity of our results to the values of the
parameters a, b, c, d, a and b. do we nd successful transitions for only a small
range of these values, in which case we should be concerned that our solutions are
not representative of the typical case? fortunately, we have established that there
does exist a large range of values of the parameters which allow for successful exits
between the two branches. figure 1 shows the range that lead to xed point solutions
when just the classical corrections are included. from such a solution, it is then
relatively straightforward to achieve a successful exit through the addition of the

quantum corrections.

the role of a and b is less clear cut. their actual values determine the onset
when loop corrections become important, hence the value of  when the graceful exit
is successfully completed. generally we nd that a successful exit requires a > 0 and
b < 0, implying that the two quantum loop terms compete against each other in
order to lead to a successful exit. unfortunately there is a degree of ambiguity present
which arises because of the invariance of the system of equations under a constant
shift of    + const, with a compensating shift of a and b. the invariance of the
system (up to a multiplicative constant in the action) is manifest at the tree level
and implies that we can make  arbitarily negative and guarantees a transition in the
weak coupling regime. as mentioned earlier, when the loop corrections are included,
this simple invariance is broken and the shift in  is compensated for by a shift in a
and b. for example, if we take the case b = c = 4 and set a = +4 and b = 0.3,
we obtain a graceful exit with f inal  0.75. in shifting the dilaton by  = 1.5,
the equivalent dynamical evolution is obtained with a nal value f inal  0.65
(weak coupling) with a  e2a = 80.34 and b  e4b = 121.03. there
appears to be a price to pay, weak coupling seems to imply large loop coecicents.
normally we would expect the coecients of successive loops to be less important.
this behaviour raises an interesting question as to whether it is possible to have
genuinely weak coupling transitions with just loop corrections included. we have
tried this for a wide range of the xed point solutions and found the same type of
behaviour.

3.5 entropic bounds

there has recently been considerable interest in the possibility that entropy con-
siderations can provide new constraints on the allowed evolution of the universe
[30, 31, 32, 33]. veneziano has suggested that in the context of string cosmology,
non-singular cosmologies should respect at all times a hubble entropy bound [31].
brustein has proposed that such solutions should satisfy a slightly dierent bound
arising from a generalised second law of thermodynamics (gsl) [32]. do our non-
singular solutions satisfy these bounds?

we will concentrate on the example of the hubble entropy bound [31]. following
bekensteins work [34], veneziano suggested that for a homogeneous cosmology, the
radius of the largest black hole that can form is determined by the largest causal
scale available, namely the hubble radius h 1. the maximum entropy enclosed in
such a universe corresponds to having one black hole in a hubble volume. dening
nh = a3h 3 to be the number of cosmological horizons within a given comoving
volume and sh = |h|2e2 the maximal entropy within the horizon corresponding
to a black hole of radius h 1, the hubble entropy is given by shb = a3he2 [31].
from this it follows that:

t shb = nhtsh + shtnh .

(3.2)

enforcing that the rate of change of this geometric entropy t shb  0 leads to the
reduced inequality

h
h  2   0

(3.3)

with the lowest-order solutions of the pbb scenario saturating this geometric bound
[31, 35, 36]. furthermore, it indicates that a xed point necessarily occurs for non-
positive  (a conclusion that also follows from the presence of a conserved quantity
in the solutions [20]). brustein et al. provided evidence in [33] that the bound was
satised for the non-singular solutions arising out of the purely classical correction
eq. (2.2) satisfying a = 1 and the constraint eq. (2.3). we have conrmed this
result, although we have also found that all the non-singular solutions we have ob-
tained, when including loop corrections, lead to violations of this bound over short
time intervals. however, as pointed out by veneziano, this is really a global bound,
in the asymptotic future, as we enter the frw phase, we always nd that shb has
increased. an example of this can be seen in gure 5.

the comparison becomes a bit more dicult when considering the bound pro-
posed by brustein arising from a generalised second law of thermodynamics (gsl)
[32]. we do nd a class of solutions which satisfy such a bound for positive values of
the chemical potential  that he introduced, but we also nd solutions which violate
the bound. it is dicult to draw any real conclusion from this, not least because
we do not know the precise form of the quantum corrections or particle production

a = 1, b = c = 4 and d = 16. the dotted line represents the classical correction, then
the loop corrections with a = +4 (dashed line) and b = 0.3 (dash-dotted line). the
plain green line also includes the eect of particle creation, with  = 0.2.

the true graceful exit solution will contain. it is certainly interesting that there are
regions of parameter space where the bound is satised. the nature of these bounds
is also under active consideration at the moment [37].

4. conclusions

in this paper, we have obtained a class of non-singular cosmologies, based on an
eective action given in eqs. (2.1), (2.2) and (2.4). the inclusion of such classical and
quantum corrections can lead to an evolution which smoothly joins the inationary
pre-big bang solution with a decelerating frw universe. the classical correction
is based on an enhanced form of the action which includes up to four derivatives in
the elds. the importance of quantum loops in achieving a smooth transition has
become manifest, in agreement with [15, 24]. furthermore, we observe that these
non-singular solutions can satisfy the recently proposed entropics bounds when loop-
corrections are included.

although encouraging, the solutions we have presented still have side eects; in
particular we had to stabilise the dilaton by hand. also, it proved quite dicult to
obtain the transition in the weak coupling regime, whilst keeping the loop corrections
small. it is not clear to us, how serious an issue this is as we do not know the form
of the true corrections. an intriguing issue is the unusual behaviour surrounding
the sfd case. why do these singular regions arise and what do they correspond to
physically?

finally, we would like to comment on a possible natural extension of this work.
recently in refs [38, 39] the authors have developed a technique to determine the

12

large-scale cmb anisotropy and power spectra generated by massless axionic seeds
in the pre-big bang scenario. they numerically determined the cmb anisotropy
power spectrum and pointed out the dierences (isocurvature hump at l  40
and rst acoustic peak at l  300) with more standard adiabatic models. these
are fascinating results, but are based on numerical solutions for the curvature and
dilaton that have not really avoided the curvature singularity. instead they are frozen
at some scale, and then begin evolving again once the post big bang frw branch is
entered. we are in a position to provide solutions where the background elds evolve
right through the transition in a singularity free manner, and it would be useful to
determine how such an evolution impacts on the modes leaving the horizon during
the transition period. how (if at all) do they inuence the cmb spectrum at large
l? this is currently under investigation.
