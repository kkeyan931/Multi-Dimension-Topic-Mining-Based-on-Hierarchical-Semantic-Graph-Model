abstract

a candidate for the conning string of gauge theories is constructed via a rep-

resentation of the ultraviolet divergences of quantum eld theory by a closed

string dilaton insertion, computed through the soft dilaton theorem. the re-

sulting (critical) conning string is conformally invariant, singles out naturally

d = 4 dimensions, and can not be used to represent theories with landau poles.

the simplest way to address the problem of a string representation of a non abelian

gauge theory [16] consist in looking for a conning string background, determined by

vanishing  -model beta functions, such that the condition of dilaton beta function equal

to zero could be reinterpreted as the standard renormalization group equation:



dg

= (g)

(1)

for the yang mills running coupling constant. this program implies a deep geometrization

of quantum eld theory renormalization program, pointing out to gravity as the underlying

dynamics controling the running of coupling constants 2.the next and more dicult step,

in the conning string program, ends up stablishing the precise relation between gauge

singlets and the conning closed string spectrum.

back to the early days of string theory [12],[18], [1]the problem of innities of one

loop bosonic string amplitudes, was treated in perfect analogy with the quantum eld

theory renormalization program. an important subproduct of that analysis, controling

the structure of string renormalizability, was the so called soft dilaton theorem.

let us consider a one loop open bosonic string amplitude for n external gluons

a1(p1, p2, . . . , pn ). on the moduli space of the cylinder this amplitude becomes singular
when the length of the cylinder t1   corresponding to an anulus with the size of the
internal hole going to zero. in string theory the singularity of this amplitude is exactly

given by the tree level amplitude of emission of a soft dilaton of momentum k = 0 that is

subsequently absorbed by the vacuum:

sing (a1(p1, p2, ...pn ) = limk0j (k) a0(p1, p2, ...pn ; k)

(2)

with j the dilaton-vacuum amplitude, (k) the dilaton propagator and a0(p1, p2, ...pn ; k)

the tree level amplitude for n gluons and one dilaton of momentum k.

2 previous work on the relationship between the renormalization group and the holographic principle

include [19],[2],[3] ,[4] and [6].

as it is clear from equation (2), the singularity of a1(p1, p2, ...pn ) comes from the dilaton

propagator (k) at k = 0. we have schematically represented in the enclosed gure the

from the soft dilaton theorem (3) and equation (5) we get a running string coupling

constant 3 g() with beta function 4 given by:

(g) = g3 (d  2)

4

(6)

it is interesting to observe that equation (6) for d > 2 is of asymptotically free type.

the modern approach, after fischler-susskind ([10]), to the string tension renormaliza-

tion (5) stems from identifying log  with the world sheet weyl factor (the liouville eld

) and to look for a background redenition with a new ricci tensor determined by:

(

1
r() )

log

(7)

in such a way that the -model beta function equations for the string are satised.

after the discovery of d-p-branes it is perfectly natural to interpret the one loop open

string amplitude a1(p1, p2, ....pn ) as a world volume amplitude with p1, p2, ..pn momenta

in p + 1 dimensions. in this case the singularity in the one loop open string amplitude can

be related to a soft dilaton insertion with momentum k in the bulk transversal directions.

this d-brane picture naturally yields the interpretation of  as a transversal coordinate.

in this set up the renormalization of  can be interpreted as dening a background metric

of the type:

ds2 =

1

()

d~x2

p+1 + d2 + d~y2

26p2

(8)

3in references [12], [18], the renormalization of the string coupling constant, g, was interpreted as a

consequence of the tachyon singularity in the one-loop open string amplitude, in the t  0 limit. in [1],
however,the appearance of g in the soft dilaton theorem was related to the transversality of the external

dilaton. we believe that the potential closed string tachyon interpretation of the renormalization of g

in parallel to the transversality condition for the dilaton, could benet from better understanding (cf.

[17],[11]).

4the rst renormalization of the string coupling constant was made in [12] by analytically regularizing

the logarithmically divergent integral. what we have done here is just to regularize it by means of a cuto

in the lower end.

3

(where d~x2

d is the at metric in rd) for  = log, the world sheet weyl factor or liouville

eld (cf.[16]). (the general idea of using strings with variable tension is due to polyakov

(cf. [17])). the condition of world sheet conformal invariance for the background (8) ought

to be consistent with the dilaton dependence () dictated by soft dilaton theorem (3) i.e

by the renormalized string coupling. as we will see in a moment this is in fact the case,

but only if p = 3!

before going into more details let us highlight the main point of this note. from the

dirac-born-infeld action for a d  3 brane we get the standard relation between yang
mills coupling constant and the closed string coupling constant g2:

g2
y m = g2

(9)

where in addition g2 is given by the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton eld. the

conning string interpretation of four dimensional pure yang mills theory will be based on

interpreting the yang mills beta function as a stringy beta function governing the string

one loop renormalization of g as due to soft dilaton insertions. once we stablish this

identication we use the soft dilaton theorem to nd the associated running string tension

(). the conning string background metric will be nally dened by a metric as (8).as

a consistency check of the whole procedure we will show that the -model beta functions

vanish for the so dened conning string background.

it is important to stress that in this approach we read the conning string geometry

directly from the perturbative ultraviolet behavior of pure yang mills gauge theory. the

identication of the string beta function, governing the renormalization of the string cou-

pling constant, with the pure gauge beta function should be understood as a generalization

to quantum eld theory of expression (2). in fact what we are doing is reinterpreting the

standard ultraviolet singularities of a quantum eld theory in terms of a soft dilaton in-

sertion in the corresponding conning string. more precisely what we understand as a

conning string is the string interpretation, in terms of a dilaton propagator (in bulk di-

4

rection) and a dilaton tadpole, of the standard ultraviolet singularities of non abelian gauge

theories. in this sense we can think of strings as a physical model of quantum eld theory

renormalizability. the d-brane description ([15]) of gauge theories will be specially suited

for our purposes.

the dbi action for a d-p-brane:

sdbi = tpz dp+1epdet[gab + bab + 2fab]

(10)

through an expansion in , conveys the relation between yang mills bare coupling and

the dilaton vacuum expectation value:

1
g2
0

= tpe0(2)2

(11)

the one loop corrections to the yang mills coupling are given in the background eld

method by:

(

g2

+

1
2

cg,1  cg,0)(f 2 + higher derivatives)

(12)

where the coecients cg,i represent the contribution of the determinants of the gluon

(i = 1) and ghosts (i = 0) quadratic terms:

cg,i = ci log(m 2/k2)

(13)

where the scale m can be appropiately chosen to cancel the bare coupling dependence in

(12).

the simplest possible matching between equations (11) and (12) suggests a renormal-

ization group dependence of the dilaton eld such as:

tpe(k2)(2)2f 2

(14)

this dependence will be interpreted as providing a running string coupling constant g(2 =

k2) that , according to our previous discussion will be identied with the running string

coupling constant one would obtain in the string renormalization of string one loop innities

5

satisfying equation (2). in order to put this identication on more solid grounds we need

to match the renormalization group scale in quantum eld theory with the cuto used in

equation (4) for the dilaton propagator. in order to do that we will again prot from de

d-brane description.

to be concrete we will consider the two gluon amplitude corresponding to the process

depicted in gure:

where g() is the cylinder green function,  is the relative position of the vertex opera-

tors, characterized by polarizations and momenta 1, p1 and 2, p2. the d-brane eect is

conveyed by the exponential factor depending on y, the distance between branes.

let us now consider the limit:

(16)

with

t = t;

y

(17)

in equation (15) d = p + 1 for p the dimension of d-brane world volume space and d

represent the dimension of the target space-time.in the limit (16), (17) amplitude (15) for

p1 and p2 on shell becomes ([9]):

where we have used the relationship for the neumann greens functions:

(4)d/2 1.2(1  d/2)(u2)d/21[(d  2)  4)d  2)b(2, 2)  24]

(18)

(19)

(20)

(where b(u, v) is eulers beta function), which by standard dimensional regularization

leads for d = 4 to:

a  

g2

(4)d/2 1.2u2 log(u2/2)[(d  2)  4(d  2)b(2, 2)  24]

(21)

from equation (21) it is clear that variable u as dened in (17) is playing the role of

the renormalization group variable. on the other hand u as it is plain from denition

(17) is nothing else but the near horizon transversal variable introduced in reference [13]

possessing the natural meaning of energy in transversal bulk direction which is precisely

the meaning of the cuto variable 2 introduced in equation (4). using equation (14) the

corresponding dilaton eld dened by (21) will be given by:

e(u2) = [(d  2)  4(d  2)b(2, 2)  24]log(u2/2)

(22)

following our strategy what we will do now is to identify the running of the dilaton (22) 5

with the string renormalization of the string coupling constant due to soft dilaton tadpole.

5it is worth remarking that for d = 4 the equation (21) gives directly the well known precise factor for

yang mills (11/3). in d = 26 instead we get zero (the correct value for ns = 22 adjoint scalars). in what

follows we will stick to d = 4.

7

next and using the soft dilaton theorem we induce from that a running dependence of

world volume metric on u. finally we chek the consistency of the so dened conning

string by solving the -model beta functions. going through these steps the conning

string background metric 6we get is:

ds2 = log(u)d~x2

4 +

du2
u2 + d~y2

21

with a dilaton eld of the type:

the -model beta equations are:

and

(u) = log log(u)

r,   = 0

2 + ()2 = cextra

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

it is known in general (cf, for example, [7],[8]) that consistency of the equations imply that

cextra must be constant (equal to 2(d10)

3

in the (world-sheet) supersymmetric case and to

26d

3

in the ordinary bosonic string). curiously enough, the above metric (23) with the

dilaton eld exactly as in (24) is a solution of the rst equation (25) for any value of p.

the second equation, (26) however can be easily shown to be given by:

1  (p + 1)/2

(logu)2

+

1

(logu)2

(27)

conveying the fact that it is a constant for p + 1 = 4 only, in which case it is zero. this

means that the string must neccessarily be critical, and we have to add the extra at

(spectator) dimensions, 21 of them in the bosonic case 7. this is one remarkable fact of

6with euclidean signature.
7it should be clear that the spectator dimensions change neither the conning string target space

ve-dimensional metric nor the yang-mills beta function. it is important to realize that the metric (23)

does not correspond to a d3 brane in a 26-dimensional ambient space. actually, the only source for a
nontrivial dilaton is the ve-dimensional metric given by the running string tension.

8

this background. another is, of course, that the sign of the dilaton in equation (24) is

xed, so that it is not possible to construct non-connig strings to describe ultraviolet

slave quantum eld theories using this set of ideas.

the conning string itself should allow the computation of many gauge invariant ob-

servables in gauge theories, such as the wilson loop. assuming a static conguration

bounded by  = l/2, and with a temporal span equal to t , it is useful to work in the
gauge in which  = x0 and  = x1. if at the same time we dene a new coordinate by

z  log u such that the metric reads

ds2 = zd~x2

4 + dz2,

(28)

and assuming a symmetric imbedding of the world sheet into the target spacetime of the

conning string, z = z(), then the induced metric on the worldsheet is given by:

ds2 = zd 2 + (z + z2)d2

(29)

it can be argued ([13]) that the semiclassical approximation to the wilson loop action is

given by the area of the world sheet computed precisely with the induced metric, that is:

s = t z l/2

l/2

dpz(z + z2)

(30)

(we are neglecting here the contribution of the dilaton to the action, possibly important).

the variational principle (30) enjoys a rst integral, namely:

p =

z2

z2 + zz2

the formal solution to this dierential equation is:

(31)

(32)

z z()

df

= z 

l/2

d
p

1

pf 3  p2f

the lower limit of the rst integral should be chosen in one of the regions in which z2

is allowed to be positive by the rst integral, namely (p, 0) or (p,). choosing by

9

concreteness it to be 0, the solution can be easily shown to be given by an elliptic integral

of the rst kind:

which implies that:

 + l/2 = (2p)1/2f (cos1(|z()/p|),

2
2

)

z()
p | = sn

|

 + l/2
(2p)1/2

(33)

(34)

if we neglect the square of the modulus, m2 = 1/2, the trigonometric approximation can

be applied:

z() = psin

 + l/2
2p

(35)

the relationship between p and l is found by demanding that z(l/2) = 0, yielding p = l2

22 .

the action then reduces to:

s = t z l/2

l/2

d

z2
p

=

t l3
4

(36)

which indeed corresponds to a conning potential.

it would be interesting to check how world sheet supersymmetry (as well as gso

projections) modify our analysis. in particular, it should be stressed that multiplicative

factors in the beta function of the gauge theory yield additive factors in the formula (24),

which do not contribute to the string beta function.

a quite surprising aspect of our analysis is the way pure yang mills perturbative infor-

mation is promoted to string dynamics. this implies a connection between perturbative

aspects of gauge dynamics (such as the beta function) with non perturbative, (stringy)

dynamics, such as infrared strong forces. the main ingredient for doing that has been

the soft dilaton theorem that allows to read coupling constant renormalization as variable

string tension and in that sense as conning string background metric. it is perhaps worth

remarking that vanishing -model beta functions - essential to the quantum consistency of

the string - have been used in our approach only at the end as a consistency check for the

metric and dilaton eld directly derived from the quantum eld theory data and not as an

extra governing principle. moreover four dimensional space time appears in this scheme as

10

the only consistent solution. all this seems to indicate that some string dynamics is already

encoded in the renormalization of asymptotically free four dimensional gauge theories.
