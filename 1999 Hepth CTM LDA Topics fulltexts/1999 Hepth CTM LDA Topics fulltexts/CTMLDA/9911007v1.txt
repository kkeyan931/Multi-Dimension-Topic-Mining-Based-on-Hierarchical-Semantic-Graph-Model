abstract

we construct new congurations of oppositely charged, static black hole pairs (diholes)
in four dimensions which are solutions of low energy string/m-theory. the black holes
are extremal and have four dierent charges. we also consider diholes in other theories
with an arbitrary number of abelian gauge elds and scalars, where the black holes can be
regarded as composite objects. we uplift the four-charge solutions to higher dimensions
in order to describe intersecting brane-antibrane systems in string and m-theory. the
properties of the strings and membranes stretched inbetween these branes and antibranes
are studied. several other generic features of these solutions are discussed.

1 introduction

the dual life of d-braneson the one hand, as objects described by the conformal eld theory
of strings that end on them, and on the other hand as supergravity solitonsis one of the
most interesting outcomes of the so-called second string revolution. indeed, this duality
lies at the heart of the ads/cft correspondence [1], and of the microscopic calculations of
black hole entropy [2]. however, the progress in the construction of exact solutions for self-
gravitating brane congurations lags far behind our understanding of those same congurations
in string perturbation theory. to mention one outstanding example, we are still far from a
satisfactory description of self-gravitating localized brane intersections, despite much eort and
some progress in certain cases [3].

supersymmetric d-branes of type ii theories are well-studied examples of bps states, which
form a very special class of states in the hilbert space of string and eld theories with extended
supersymmetry. so far, most non-perturbative tests of the duality conjecture are based on such
bps states, mainly because they are stable, protected from quantum radiative corrections, and
hence, easier to handle. however nice their properties though, these states do not account for
the full spectrum of any string theory, and the study of non-bps states, which is still in its
infancy, is essential in any viable attempt at shaping up m-theory.

in the same way as one may interpret bps d-branes as classical solutions to type ii su-
pergravities, there have been some eorts to construct supergravity solutions describing a par-
ticular class of non bps states corresponding to d-braneanti-d-brane congurations. for
instance, the four-dimensional kaluza-klein dipole constructed in [4] can be embedded in
eleven-dimensional supergravity in order to provide a static d6d6 brane conguration of
type iia string theory suspended in an external magnetic eld [5, 6]. more recently, exact so-
lutions to einstein-maxwell theory, with and without dilaton, describing static (but unstable)
pairs of extremal black holes with opposite charges (hereafter, diholes) were constructed in a
background magnetic eld, and were argued to admit an interpretation in terms of a system of
intersecting branes and intersecting antibranes in higher dimensions, after a suitable uplifting
of the four-dimensional solutions when the dilaton coupling takes one of four special values [7].
the explicit task of uplifting the solutions in this way has been undertaken since then in [8].
other recent studies of congurations of this type in the context of string theory include [9].

the generalization of these congurations to the case where the charges of the branes are
not equal is the main subject of this paper. after reviewing in section 2 the known case
of single charge diholes, we construct in section 3 a new exact solution of four-dimensional
general relativity describing oppositely charged, static black hole pairs, where the black holes
are extremal and have an arbitrary number n of dierent charges. black holes of this sort can
be regarded as composites of n extremal, singly charged black holes. therefore, our solutions

1

describe composites of n diholes. we however mostly concentrate on the case n = 4 with two
electric and two magnetic charges, because of the well-known consistent truncation of a wide
class of low energy superstring theory compactications to a four-dimensional action whose
bosonic sector,

(1.1)

is the starting point of our analysis when considering four abelian gauge elds. our construc-
tion is inspired by two known results. first of all, when the branes carry dierent charges,
the corresponding four-dimensional black holes appear as solutions to theories with four u(1)
gauge elds and three scalars of type (1.1) [10]. second of all, four-charge pairs of black holes
accelerating apart were found in [11, 12], which, when adequately written, are very suggestive
of the form their static counterparts might take. (composites with two charges, which can be
obtained as a particular case of the four-charge case, are also of interest, see [13, 14]).

as with other diholes, the composite dihole solutions in an asymptotically at space suer
from conical singularities along the axis of symmetry. these singularities can be removed by
suspending the diholes in external magnetic elds, a procedure we will examine in some detail.
it should be noted that, for reasons to similar those discussed in [7], composite diholes are
unstable equilibrium congurations.

although these new composite diholes deserve to be studied in their own right as four-
dimensional solutions of general relativity, they can be embedded in ten or eleven-dimensional
supergravities, and interpreted as systems of intersecting branes and intersecting anti-branes.
this is discussed in section 4, in an attempt to test any relevant connections between super-
gravity solitons and non bps states described by braneanti-brane type of congurations, and
therefore to shed some light on the duality conjecture beyond the bps analysis.

2 single-charge diholes

we start by reviewing the single-charge dihole solutions as they were studied in [7]. our purpose
here is not only to introduce the structure of the solutions, which is somewhat involved, but
also to discuss the solutions in a coordinatization that is slightly dierent from the one used in
previous literature, and which will be required later.

it was shown in [15, 16] that the eld equations of einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory derived

when comparing these solutions to those in [7, 15, 16] and to the literature on similar
solutions, it is important to notice a relative shift of the radial coordinate r. to recover the

(2.8)

we now follow the analysis in [7]. the solution is clearly asymptotically at as r  , and
in this asymptotic region the gauge eld is that of a dipole. although the solution contains
apparent singularities at r =  (where  = 0), the actual situation is somewhat subtle. notice
rst that the axis of symmetry of the solution (the xed-point set of the killing vector )
consists of the semi-innite lines  = 0,  (running from r =  to ), and the segment r = 

3

that stretches in between them (running from  = 0 to ). the crucial feature of these solutions
is that at each of the poles (r = ,  = 0) and (r = ,  = ), lies a (distorted) extremal charged
dilatonic black hole. in order to see this, change coordinates r,  to , ,

for  = 0 (the case of einstein-maxwell theory without a dilaton), this geometry is that of a
bertotti-robinson universe (ads2  s2), albeit distorted by the factor g(). this is, we nd
a geometry just like that of the region close to the horizon ( = 0) of an extremal reisnner-
nordstrom black hole, but, instead of being spherically symmetric, it is elongated along the
axis in a prolate shape. for other values of  the solution at  = 0 has a curvature singularity
which is just like the one at the core of extremal charged dilaton black holes, although, again,
the geometry is not spherically symmetric due to the distorting factor g(). hence we see that
the dipolar eld of the full solution is created by two oppositely charged extremal black holes:
a dihole1.

that the dipolar eld is originated by a pair of extremal black holes, and not by, say,
a pointlike or linear singularity or a pair of charges of a dierent kind, is obviously a non
trivial issue. apparently, bonnors dipole (i.e., the  = 0, non-dilatonic solution found in
[15]) was originally thought to describe a singular pointlike (or segment-like) dipole. the rst
identication of a self-gravitating pole-antipole conguration was made for the case of kaluza-
klein theory ( = 3) in [4], and then rened in [5]. however, in those papers the interpretation
was made on the basis of topological arguments that are particular to the higher-dimensional
structure of kaluza-klein theory, and which cannot be applied to solutions with other values of

1in [16] it was argued that for the case  = 1, and only for this case, the solution contains regular non-
extremal horizons, and describes a black hole-white hole conguration. this interpretation is not consistent
with what we have just described: two extremal horizons, regular for  = 0 and singular for  > 0.

4

the dilaton. the kaluza-klein dipole was later analyzed in [6] by means of essentially the same
transformation as (2.9). that the solutions (2.2) of [16] actually describe a dihole for arbitrary
values of , including the case  = 0 which has regular horizons, was rst proven in [7].

given the two-black hole interpretation, it would be natural to expect the dihole solutions
to contain the single black hole solutions as the limiting case where one of the holes is pulled
innitely away from the other. this is indeed the case. working in coordinates , , if the
parameter a is taken to innity while keeping all other quantities nite, then the solution
reduces precisely to that of a single extremal dilatonic black hole. the parameter a plays then
the role of a measure of the separation between the holes. however, this is just a qualitative
statement, since the proper spatial distance between the extremal horizons (for  = 0) is
actually innite. a more accurate statement is to say that increasing a, while keeping the
holes charge xed, increases the value of the dipole moment (the relation, however, becomes
approximately linear only for large a).

we are primarily interested, however, in the situation where both black holes are present
in the solution, and therefore we consider nite values of a. the attraction, gravitational
and electromagnetic, that they exert on one another is not balanced by any external eld, so
the geometry reacts, as is usual in these situations, by producing conical singularities along
the symmetry axis [7, 16]. on physical grounds, it is clear that an external magnetic eld
aligned with the dihole could provide the force to balance the conguration. an exact solution
containing such a eld can be constructed by applying a harrison transformation to (2.2). this
was done in [7], and results in the metric

and  and  still given by (2.5). at distances much larger than the size of the dipole (r  a, m)
the solution asymptotes to the dilatonic melvin universe, which describes a self-gravitating,
cylindrically symmetric magnetic eld. it is of interest now to examine what eect the external
eld has on the black hole horizons. to see this, change coordinates again as in (2.9), and then

function is

(2.17)

then g() = 1, and the distortion of the holes disappears2.
it was shown in [7] that this
very same value of the magnetic eld produces a cancellation of the conical defects along the
symmetry axis, with the choice  = 2. it is quite peculiar that the horizons recover their
spherical symmetry precisely when the forces in the system are balanced and the two black
holes are suspended in (unstable) equilibrium in the external eld.
in a sense, the latter
exactly compensates for the distortions of the horizon induced by the presence of the other
hole.

in the dual electric case the background melvin eld cannot be introduced by means of a
solution-generating transformation as in the magnetic case. nevertheless, the electric solution
can be constructed by straightforward dualization of the magnetic one. the dilaton reverses
sign as usual, and we nd the electric potential to be

(2.18)

this form of the potential manifestly shows how the potential tends to a uniform eld at 
br cos  as r  . in this case b is the asymptotic electric eld along the axis.

the physical charge of the holes can be easily read by examining the gauge potentials in the
region near the horizons. if we keep the eld b arbitrary, instead of xing it to the equilibrium
value (2.17), then, as   0, the dilaton goes to

we address now the construction of new dihole solutions in theories with richer eld content
than the single-gauge eld theories of (2.1).

3.1 string/m-theory diholes with four charges

in this subsection we consider a theory containing four abelian gauge elds and three scalars,
with action (1.1), which appears as a consistent truncation of a large variety of compactica-
tions of low energy string theory, such as toroidally compactied heterotic, iia and iib string
theories, and also d = 11 supergravity [8, 17, 18]. correspondingly, there is a large number of
possible higher dimensional interpretations of the dierent gauge elds and their charge sources.
a few of all these possible oxidations will be discussed in sec. 4.

black hole solutions to this theory were constructed in [10]. the black holes carry charges
qi, i = 1 . . . , 4 under each of the gauge elds, the charges q1, q3 being of magnetic type, and
q2, q4 electric (or viceversa, if we consider a dual conguration). when only s out of the four
possible charges are equal and non-zero, and the rest are zero, then the theory, and its solutions,

reduce to those of the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory with coupling  = q(4  s)/s. this is,
solutions with 1, 2, 3 or 4 equal charges correspond to dilaton coupling  = 3, 1, 1/3 and
0, respectively. the extremal black hole solutions can be constructed following the harmonic
function rule (see e.g., [19]). each gauge eld enters in the solution through products of
harmonic functions, in a manner that does essentially not depend on the other gauge elds. in
[11, 12] it was shown that solutions with two such black holes accelerating apart could also be
found for these theories (see [14] for the solutions in a u(1)2 theory). we are interested here
in congurations where the two black holes with opposite charges are static.

u(1)4 dipole elds. their metric is

the solutions are parameterized in terms of ve independent parameters. physically, the pa-
rameters can be regarded as xing the four charges of the holes and the separation between
the pair. in practice, we will choose the independent parameters to be  (which we take to be
positive) and all the ai (satisfying |ai|  ). the other parameters mi are not independent,
but rather given by

m 2

i = 2  a2
i .

(3.8)

when a2
i = 2 for all i, then all the mis vanish and the metric is that of at space. in general
we can have some mi = 0 for some values of i, and nonzero for others, and get a non-trivial
solution.

there are several non-obvious aspects in going from the solutions of the single-gauge eld
i + m 2
theory to the solutions of the u(1)4 theory. one of them is that the combination a2
i
should take the same value for all i, so with our choice of radial coordinate, the function 
is the same for all values of i. another point is related to the characteristic way in which

8

the metric functions in (3.1) factorize into contributions from each separate gauge eld (a
similar factorization had been observed also for melvin elds and accelerating black holes in
[12]). the way the factorization happens in these solutions relies crucially on our choice of
the radial coordinate, explained in the previous section. to see this, realize that when more
than one parameter mi is involved, the radial shift (2.7) cannot be properly undone3. the
factorization suggests that the u(1)4 dihole can then be thought of as a composite of four
diholes. for an isolated u(1)4 black hole it is possible to separate, at zero cost in energy, each
of the constituents from the other three, i.e., the black hole can be regarded as a composite
of four marginally bound components [18]. however, it is not clear whether we can separate,
at zero energy cost, the single-charge component diholes of a composite dihole. it may well be
that what was in isolation a state bound at threshold (the four- charge extremal black hole)
becomes non-marginally bound in the presence of its anti-state.

it is also a straightforward matter to check that the dilatonic dihole solutions (2.2) for

 = 3, 1, 1/3 and 0 are recovered by taking 1, 2, 3 or 4 non-zero and equal values of mi.

the analysis of these solutions can be done in exactly the same manner as we have done
for bonnors dipole and its dilatonic counterparts. coordinate singularities occur when r = ,
and these turn out to be, away from the poles, conical singularities. again, a straightforward
analysis of the conical decits along the various portions of the symmetry axis reveals that
it is not possible to eliminate the decit along the segment r =  with the natural choice of
period  = 2 which cancels the decit along the lines  = 0, . however, these singularities
can be resolved by introducing magnetic background elds in our axisymmetric solutions by
means of the generalized harrison transformation constructed in [12] for the u(1)4 theory, and
by subsequently tuning them to a value which eliminates the conical decit. the latter point,
we will see, becomes somewhat subtle when more than one gauge eld is present.

after applying the generalized harrison transformation, the metric of the u(1)4 dipole

solution becomes

3notice that this implies that the modied harmonic function rule conjectured in [8] on the basis of the
solutions with a single gauge eld is of little use in trying to get to the new solutions with dierent charges,
since that rule was based on a choice of radial coordinate that is inappropriate for this purpose.

this solution obviously reduces to the previous one if we set bi = 0. we have denoted the
external elds collectively as bi, even if for i = 2, 4 they are electric elds. observe that the
metric and scalars can be obtained from (3.1) and (3.7) by simply substituting i for ti.

along the outer semi-axes  = 0,  the conical decit is given by (=0,) = 2  , no
matter what the value of the external elds bi is. we thus choose  = 2 in order to remove
the conical decit on that portion of the symmetry axis. on the other hand, the decit along
the inner segment of the axis, r = , is calculated to be,

we can see that, for the choice of period in the variable  we made earlier, i.e.,  = 2, the
conical singularity along r =  disappears when

4

yi=1  ai



+ biqi! = 1.

(3.16)

a very particular solution of this equation is obtained by requiring each of the factors on the
l.h.s. to be equal to 1, i.e., set the strength of the external elds to the values

bi =

=

2mi

( + mi + ai)2 ,

i = 1 . . . , 4

(3.17)

which can be interpreted as a separate force-balance condition for each of the gauge elds.
nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that (3.17) is by no means a typical solution. on the
contrary, the balance of forces will typically be achieved with dierent contributions from each

10

factor in (3.16). as a matter of fact, it is even possible to satisfy (3.16) for diholes with four
dierent charges by turning on only one external eld, say b1.

although the metric still appears to be singular at the endpoints of the u(1)4 dipole, one
can actually reveal its true structure by studying the solution near the throat as we did in the
previous section. as before, we may explore this region by changing coordinates from (r, ) to
(, ) as in (2.9) and by keeping  much smaller than any other scale in the problem. near
r = ,  = 0, the metric becomes4,

a function such that gi() = 1 when the eld bi is tuned to the value (3.17). however, for
more generic cases the deformation function g() will be dierent from 1 even if the conical
singularities are cancelled through (3.16), and the horizons will in general be deformed. this
feature is particular to theories with more than one gauge eld. in any event, we see that near
the poles the solution exhibits, apart from the distortion, the same structure as a four-charge
black hole near its horizon.

the gauge elds are also distorted near the throat, where they are given by

which present the unusual feature that, in general, they will vary as we move along the horizon.

4we are assuming here that all four charges are non-zero. the modications for the case where some of them

vanish can be inferred easily.

the deformation of the black hole horizons allows us to check a non-trivial aspect of the
entropy-area law for black holes. notice that when all four charges are turned on, the black holes
have a non-singular, deformed horizon with non-vanishing area. now, for an isolated extremal

black hole the area is entirely determined by its physical charges qi as ah = 4q1q2q3q4.

this area can be associated, through the bekenstein-hawking law, with an entropy. on physical
grounds we would expect the entropy of the system to remain unchanged if its physical charges,
which x the state, remain xed, no matter what the distortion of the horizon may be. it is
by no means clear that the solutions given above should satisfy this property. nonetheless, the
area of each of the horizons in the dihole conguration is

ah = 4q1q2q3q4 = 4qq1q2q3q4 ,

(3.23)

where the last equality is obtained when the singularities are cancelled by requiring (3.16) (but
not necessarily (3.17)) and  = 2. hence, the area as a function of the physical charges
remains unaltered, despite the deformation of the black hole horizon. a similar test of the
invariance of the entropy under deformations of the horizon was performed in [12].

finally, it is a straightforward exercise to show that when one of the holes is pulled away by
making  large, while keeping r,  sin2  and mi nite, we get i  2(+mi), qi  mi  qi
and i  (1 + qi
 )1, so that the metric becomes that of an isolated extremal u(1)4 black hole.

such theories were considered in [12] as a generalization of the theories with four abelian gauge
elds we have just considered. in general, these u(1)n theories do not seem to be related to low
energy string/m-theory, nor to any other supergravity theory in four dimensions. nevertheless
they exhibit the same peculiarities as the u(1)4 theories, which are merely a particular case
of the above type of theory, as described in [12]. all these theories admit black hole solutions
which follow the harmonic function rule, as well as solutions with two black holes accelerating
apart [12]. it is therefore natural to expect that dihole solutions can be constructed as well.

the qualitative features of these solutions are precisely the same as for the u(1)4 case
of the previous subsection, so our discussion will be rather cursory. these solutions have
n + 1 independent parameters, {, ai, i = 1, . . . , n}, while mi are xed by m 2
i . by
setting n = 1 and shifting the coordinate r to r  m1, one recovers bonnors magnetic dipole
solution of non-dilatonic einstein-maxwell theory [15]. the dilatonic solutions of [16] can also
be recovered in a simple manner for rational values of 2 [12]. to this eect, take s out of the
n possible parameters mi (say, i = 1, . . . , s) to be equal and non-zero, and the remaining mi,
i = s + 1, . . . , n to be vanishing. in this way, the solutions (2.2) are recovered, with dilaton

coupling  = qn/s  1, and with the elds identied as

the conical singularities that the solutions possess can be removed by means of the gener-
alized harrison transformation for the u(1)n theory constructed in [12], and by subsequently
tuning them to a value which eliminates the conical decit.

4 intersecting brane-antibrane congurations

we already pointed out that the solutions to the u(1)4 theory admit embeddings into higher
dimensional supergravity theories arising from string/m-theory at low energies. when uplifted
to d  5 dimensions, each individual charge (3.21) will typically be interpreted as the charge
(density) of a p-brane, with all its spatial directions wrapped around a p-torus, and delocalized
in d p 4 transverse directions. we are referring to branes in a manner loose enough to allow
for pp-waves and kk monopoles to be introduced in a straightforward way in the discussion 5.
solutions with just one out of four non-vanishing charges correspond to single brane solu-
tions, whereas solutions with more than one charge describe brane intersections or (marginal)
bound states of branes. a u(1)4 dihole solution, when viewed in this way, can be oxidized
to describe an intersection of up to four branes and an anti-intersection of the corresponding
anti-branes. we have tried to sketch such a conguration in fig. 1. each brane is parallel to
its anti-brane, and the whole system is delocalized in such a way that the branes are localized
in the overall transverse directions only.

the construction of brane-antibrane solutions based on the u(1)4 dihole solutions described
in sec. 3 does not signicantly dier in its concept from the way a one-black hole solution with
four or less charges is uplifted to a brane conguration. indeed, it was pointed out in [7] (see also
[8]) that the diholes of einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory could be uplifted in a straightforward
way to intersecting brane-anti-brane congurations of the sort just described, with the severe
restriction that the charges of the intersecting branes should all be equal. this restriction can be
relaxed when using our new u(1)4 solutions, which allow for a richer catalog of congurations.
the factorized form of the solutions, particularly that of the scalar elds involved, greatly
helps in deducing the form of the higher dimensional (internal) metric components from those
of ordinary brane congurations: the harmonic functions hi of the latter get replaced by the
functions t 1
, whose inverses were introduced in (3.4) and (3.13). we stress that this
rule, however, applies only to the internal dimensions and not to the four-dimensional part of
the solution.

note that we are unable to consider non-extremal branes, since a solution describing a pair
of non-extremal charged black holes is not available. let us also emphasize that solutions
without an external eld contain conical singularities along the symmetry axis, and a physical
interpretation in string/m-theory in terms of, e.g., local cosmic strings, is not clear. neverthe-
less, it is possible to remove these singularities by introducing an external eld, using a similar
procedure to the one described in the previous sections.

5more precisely, any charge that would naturally enter a solution through a harmonic function can be paired

up with its anticharge to provide a characterization of brane-antibrane systems

the same applies, mutatis mutandis, for the anti-intersection p  p. the p- and p-branes
are parallel. in the solutions described in the text the branes are delocalized in their relative
transverse directions, and also in all but three overall transverse dimensions (r, , ). of the
latter directions, only the symmetry axis is shown in the gure. when innitely separated from
the other intersection (  ), the p- and p-branes we consider are marginally bound to each

this is exactly the solution for the four d3-brane intersection constructed in [20, 21]. the
solution for four anti-d3-branes intersection (i.e. for four d3-branes with opposite charge) is
obtained when taking the    limit instead of the   0 limit. however, in order to show
that the system consists of the intersection of four d3-branes together with the intersection of
four d3-branes in ten dimensions, one must consider nite values of ai and take the near horizon
limit of (4.1) in complete analogy with the four-dimensional case. as already mentioned earlier,
this solution has a conical decit along the symmetry axis, which pulls the branes apart from
each other. however, as can be anticipated from the discussion of u(1)n diholes suspended
in external magnetic elds, such a brane/anti-brane conguration can be cured of any conical
decit along the symmetry axis by tuning the magnetic eld b to an appropriate value. the
relevant ten-dimensional metric is then given by (4.1), where the four functions ti are replaced
by the functions i given in (3.13). the ve-form eld-strength is again formally written as
in (4.2), with the magnetic potentials a1/3 and electric potentials a2/4 given by (3.10) and
(3.11) respectively. in the near horizon limit, and with ai large (r  mi), the functions i,
for   0, become the harmonic functions ti involved in the description of the four d3-brane
intersections, and the limiting metric is (4.3). if    instead, one obtains the four d3-brane
intersections. one concludes that the metric

the dipole solution in u(1)4 theory when compactied on a seven-torus. once again, we may
construct an analog solution in the presence of an external magnetic eld in order to remove
any conical singularity arising in the above solution. replacing ti by i everywhere in (4.5),
and taking the potentials to be (3.10) and (3.11), one obtains a solution to d = 11 supergravity
which again describes a system of intersecting branes (two m2 and two m5) and intersecting
anti-branes ( two m2 branes and two m5-branes), but this time with non-zero magnetic eld b.

we end this subsection with a conguration we can relate to the d6d6 system studied
by sen, and which we will employ later in order to characterize the string stretching between
the branes and anti-branes using arguments similar to those in [6].

this metric corresponds to a d6d6 system. setting to zero the charges q2, q3, q4 of the three

after shifting r  r  m in the above metric, one exactly recovers the gross-perry kaluza-
klein dipole [4] embedded in eleven dimensions, which is the starting point of sens analysis of
the d6d6 system.

we would like to stress at this point that, instead of performing a straightforward kaluza-
klein compactication along the x11 direction in (4.11) to recover the conguration (4.9) (which
possesses conical singularities along the axis), one may reduce along a twisted direction [5, 6].
in this way one obtains a conguration of d6d6 branes suspended in a magnetic eld.
precisely the same result is obtained if a harrison transformation with the appropriate value
of the dilaton coupling is performed directly on the reduced solution. as a matter of fact, the
equivalence between twisted kk reductions and harrison transformations in the reduced kk
theory was proven in [22]. in the case at hand, we know that the eect of performing a harrison
transformation on the metric (4.9) is just to replace t1 by 1 in (4.9).

4.2 the strings and membranes stretched between branes and an-

tibranes

the proper length of a string stretched between the poles where branes intersect depends in
an essential way on the number of branes that intersect. these strings stretch along the line
r = , parametrized by , 0 <  < . if there are less than four branes at the intersection
then the proper spatial distance between poles is nite, but if all four branes are present then
this distance is innite. a situation where things can be studied further is that where a iia
conguration can be uplifted to d = 11 supergravity. the line r =  is bered with the extra
dimensions and becomes a surface. as a consequence, the string stretching between branes
becomes a membrane. for the case of the d6d6 the study of such a membrane was carried
out in [6]. the conguration in (3) in the previous subsection is also suitable for such an
analysis, and will allow us to recover as a particular case the results of [6].

when we uplift (4.7) to eleven dimensions we obtain a kaluza-klein dipole superposed to
a system of three intersecting delocalized m2 branes and three intersecting delocalized m2
anti-branes, that is,

in m-theory, the open string state should be described by a membrane wrapped on the surface
r = . in order to distinguish it from the other, self-gravitating m2-branes in the conguration,
we will denote this one as an m2-brane. as we just said, it wraps the surface r = . this
surface is a bolt of the killing vector q = /x11 +
2m1(m1+) /. it is convenient to work with
2m1(m1+) x11 such that q = 0. in terms of this coordinate
an adapted coordinate  =  
the metric induced on the bolt is given by

now, when all four charges are turned on, this surface is topologically a cylinder. its shape,
and therefore that of the m2-brane that wraps it, is like a sphere with two innite funnels at
its poles. this is most easily understood by looking at the geometry near the poles in d = 11,

19

after changing to the coordinates (2.9). we know that near the poles the geometry is, up to
some angular distortion, the same as that of the core of an intersection between a kk monopole
and three m2-branes. but the latter is

is innite due to the divergence of the integration at  = 0, . since the energy of the m2-brane
is e = tm2a, where tm2 is the membrane tension, we reach the conclusion that the energy of
the m2-brane stretched inbetween the poles is innite! notice that it remains innite even if
we set a1 = 0 (so that  = m1). if the latter is to be considered as the limit of coincidence of
the branes and antibranes, then the conclusion is even more striking than that reached in [6].
the situation, however, is dierent if one sets one, two or three m2 charges to zero in (4.14).
say that n of these charges are dierent from zero. then, neglecting the angular distortion,
the geometry near the poles is

where q is the product of the non-zero m2 charges. it is straightforward to see that if n 6= 0, 3,
the geometry is singular. when n = 0 the geometry is just r10,1, since this is the core of a
kk monopole. the singularity for n = 1, 2 is nevertheless a nite spatial distance away, so the
m2-brane is topologically a sphere, with curvature singularities at the poles. its proper area a,
and the energy of the m2-brane, is nite.

let us now consider the limit where the branes and antibranes are coincident.

it is not
obvious what choice of parameters in the solution should correspond to this limit. one would
certainly require any external elds to be absent, since their eect is to pull apart the poles.
for the d6d6 system it was argued in [6] that one should also require a = 0, since this
minimizes the distance between poles. in the present case, if we set all the ai to zero then

20

we would have all mi equal to each other, and as a consequence all charges would be equal,
which seems too restrictive. in order to motivate other alternatives, notice rst that all the
branes at an intersection move together, since they all intersect at the same pole. then, it
might be enough to set just one of the ai to zero. this would leave us with four parameters,
which can be regarded as the four charges of the branes, as desired. since a1 is singled out
as characterizing the twist in the eleventh direction, then, at least in the context of m-theory,
it probably makes more sense to dene the coincidence limit by setting only a1 = 0 (so that
 = m1), while leaving a2, a3, a4 arbitrary.

with this choice, the conclusions we have reached above for the m2-brane stretched between
branes and antibranes still hold in the coincidence limit: when any of the charges of the m2-
branes is zero the proper area of the m2-brane is nite, whereas it is innite when all charges
are turned on. this conclusion, which may be taken as a prediction about the strong coupling
limit of this brane-antibrane conguration, is even more striking than that reached in [6] for
d6d6 branes.

5 discussion and outlook

although bps states in string/m-theory have been under very close scrutiny over the last few
years, they are far from providing us with the full spectrum of such theories. for instance, sen
has recently highlighted the role played by d-braneanti-d-brane systems in constructing both
unstable and stable non-bps d-branes [23]. motivated by his earlier work [6] on a d6d6
conguration of type iia string theory, which he relates to the kaluza-klein dipole solution [4]
(euclidean 4d kerr metric) embedded in eleven dimensions, and also by the recent work of one of
us [7] on black diholes, we have identied new classical exact solutions to 4d general relativity
containing n abelian gauge elds and n 1 independent scalar elds, whose generic lagrangians
are given by (3.24). as already noted in the introduction, the case of two electric and two
magnetic charges (n = 4) is particularly interesting since the corresponding lagrangian (1.1)
arises as a consistent truncation of a wide class of low energy superstring compactications,
and therefore, the new 4d solutions can be uplifted and interpreted as rather sophisticated
braneanti-brane systems.

for general values of n, our 4d solutions depend on n + 1 parameters {, ai, i = 1, . . . n}, are
static, axisymmetric and describe composite diholes. indeed, the near horizon analysis of these
solutions reveals they contain two throats which one can identify, for arbitrary values of the
parameters (which label the n charges and the separation between the holes), with the throats
of two oppositely charged extremal composite black holes. although the composite dihole
congurations are plagued with conical singularities, it is possible to suspend them in external

21

magnetic elds via generalised harrison transformations, and tune these elds to values which
eliminate the conical decit and keep the congurations in equilibrium, though unstable: a slight
deviation along the symmetry axis from the equilibrium conguration is expected [5] to result
in either making the composite black holes collapse onto each other or accelerate apart. this
instability, however, is of a completely dierent nature from the tachyonic instability appearing
in perturbative string theory [23]. one might even wonder if the latter is a feature that survives
when the string coupling is increased and the eects of self-gravity become important.

the total charge of the u(1)4 composite diholes is zero while their adm mass, whether
or not they are suspended in external elds, is given by e = 1
i )1/2
and is generically strictly positive.6 these congurations are therefore non extremal, and when
analysed in a context of supersymmetry, break all supersymmetries, an observation which is
particularly obvious in the presence of external elds, which are asymptotically melvin and
therefore have no killing spinors associated to them. another interesting observation is that
mi(mi+)
the mass of the two composite extremal black holes, which is equal to 2mbh = 1
,
exceeds the adm mass e of the composite dihole: the latter is therefore non-marginally bound.
when uplifted to ten or eleven dimensions, it becomes a supergravity soliton and can be inter-
preted as a system of four intersecting branes and four intersecting anti-branes as sketched in
figure 1, with the (anti)branes localized in the overall transverse directions only. each brane
is charged under a dierent u(1) and has its corresponding anti-brane parallel to it. the exis-
tence of such congurations of branes and antibranes at arbitrary (large) separation 2 when
ai  mi is another indication that the static force vanishes between the branes and antibranes.
we thus succeeded in providing classical solutions to supergravity theories which describe
static, zero charge congurations which appear as a cluster of intersecting charged branes and a
cluster of intersecting charged anti-branes. they are non-trivial generalisations of the d6d6
systems analysed by sen, who recognised that systems with coincident branes and anti-branes
could in particular be used in the construction of stable non-bps states of a new type, via
orientifolding and orbifolding. his analysis relies on the perturbative description of d-branes,
and it would be very instructive to study whether one can deform the supergravity solitons
associated to braneanti-brane systems in such a way that the resulting solutions (if any)
describe these new stable non-bps states. a rst step in this direction should involve the
study of the coincidence limit of the branes and antibranes in congurations of the sort we
have been discussing. however, it appears that in the presence of gravity these systems exhibit
features markedly dierent to those seen at the perturbative level, in particular, the size of
membranes (and strings) stretched between the branes and antibranes remains non-zero (even
innite) in the limit of coincidence. this may cast some doubt on the possibility of carrying
