abstract

using the collective eld theory approach of largen generalized twodimensional

yangmills theory on cylinder, it is shown that the classical equation of motion of

collective eld is a generalized hopf equation. then, using the itzyksonzuber integral

at the largen limit, it is found that the classical young tableau density, which satises

the saddlepoint equation and determines the largen limit of free energy, is the inverse

of the solution of this generalized hopf equation, at a certain point.

introduction

the 2d yangmills theory (ym2) is a theoretical tool for understanding one of the most
important theories of particle physics, i.e., qcd4. it is known that the ym2 theory is a
solvable model, and in the recent years there have been much eorts to analyze the dierent
aspects of this theory. the lattice formulation of ym2 has been known for a long time [1], and
many of the physical quantities of this model, e.g. the partition function and the expectation
values of the wilson loops, have been calculated in this context [2,3]. the continuum (path
integral) approach of ym2 has also been studied in [4] and, using this approaches, besides the
above mentioned quantities, the green functions of eld strengths have also been calculated
[5].

it is known that the ym2 theory is dened by the lagrangian tr(f 2) on a riemann
surface. in an equivalent formulation, one can use itr(bf ) + tr(b2) as the lagrangian of
this model, where b is an auxiliary pseudo-scalar eld in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group. path integration over the eld b leaves an eective lagrangian of the form
tr(f 2).

now the ym2 theory is essentially characterized by two important properties: invariance
under area-preserving dieomorphisms and the lack of propagating degrees of freedom. these
properties are not unique to the itr(bf ) + tr(b2) lagrangian, but rather are shared by a
wide class of theories, called the generalized 2d yangmills theories (gym2s). these theories
are dened by replacing the tr(b2) term by an arbitrary class function f (b) [6]. several
properties of gym2 theories have been studied in recent years, for example the partition
function [7,8], and the green functions on arbitrary riemann surface [9].

one of the important features of ym2, and also gym2s, is its behaviour in the case of
large gauge groups, i.e., the largen behaviour of su(n) (or u(n)) gauge theories. study
of the largen limit of these theories is motivated on one hand by an attempt to nd a
string representation of qcd in four dimension [10]. it was shown that the coecients of
1/n expansion of the partition function of su(n) gauge theories are determined by a sum
over maps from a two-dimensional surface onto the two-dimensional target space. these
kinds of calculations have been done in [11] and [12] for ym2 and in [8] for gym2.

on the other hand, the study of the largen limits is useful in exploring more general
properties of largen qcd. to do this, one must calculate, for example, the largen be-
haviour of the free energy of these theories. this is done by replacing the sum over irreducible
representations of su(n) (or u(n)), appearing in the expressions of partition function, by
a path integral over continuous young tableaus, and calculating the area-dependence of the
free energy from the saddle-point conguration. in [13], the logarithmic behaviour of the
free energy of u(n) ym2 on a sphere with area a < ac = 2 has been obtained, and in [14]
the authors have considered the case a > ac and proved the existence of a thirdorder phase

1

transition in ym2. a fact that has been known earlier in the context of lattice formulation
[15]. in the case of gym2 models, the same transition has been shown for f (b) = tr(b4) in
[16] and for f (b) = tr(b6) and f (b) = tr(b2) + gtr(b4) in [17], all on the sphere.

such kinds of investigations are much more involved in the cases of surfaces with bound-
aries. this is because in these cases, the characters of the group elements, which specify the
boundary conditions, enter in the expressions of the partition functions and this makes the
saddlepoint equations too complicated. in [18] (see also [21]), the authors considered the
ym2 theory on cylinder and investigated its largen behaviour. if we denote the two circles
forming the boundaries of the cylinder by c1 and c2, then the boundary conditions are

specied by xed holonomy matrices uc1 =pexphc1 a(x)dx and uc2 =pexphc2 a(x)dx.

in the largen limit, in which the eigenvalues of these matrices become continuous, the
eigenvalue densities of uc1 and uc2 are denoted by 1() and 2(), respectively, where
  [0, 2]. then it was shown that the free energy of ym2 on cylinder, minus some known
functions, satises a hamiltonjacobi equation with a hamiltonian describing a uid of a
certain negative pressure [18]. the time coordinate of this system is the area of the cylinder
between one end and a loop (0  t  a), and its position coordinate is , and there are two
boundary conditions ()|t=0 = 1() and ()|t=a = 2(). it is found that the classical
equation of motion of this uid is the hopf (or burgers) equation. further, it was shown
that the young tableau density c, satisfying the saddlepoint equation (and therefore spec-
ifying the representation which has the dominant contribution in the partition function at
largen), satises c(0()) = . 0() is (, t) at a time (area) t at which the uid is
at rest. when uc1 = uc2, 0() is the solution of hopf equation at t = a/2. in the case of
a disc, 2() = (), the authors have calculated the critical area ac by using the results of
the itzyksonzuber integral [19] at largen limit.

studying the same problem for gym2 has begun in [20], in the context of master eld
formalism. in this paper we study this problem, gym2 on cylinder, using the above described
technique. the plan of the paper is as following. in section 2, by calculating the classical
hamiltonjacobi equation, we obtain the corresponding hamiltonian for the eigenvalue den-
sity for almost general f (b) and nd the classical equations of motion. it is found that these
equations are the generalized hopf equation. in section 3, we show that the young tableau
density c is the inverse function of the solution of the generalized hopf equation at some
certain time (area).

2 the collective eld theory and the generalized hopf

equation

as it is shown in [7,8,9], the partition function of a gym on a cylinder is

r(u1)r(u2)eac(r),

z = xr

(1)

where u1 and u2 are wilson loops corresponding to the boundaries of the cylinder, the
summation is over all irreducible representations of the gauge group, r is the trace of the
representation r of the group element, and c is a certain casimir of the group, characterizing
the particular gym2 theory we are working with. for the gauge group u(n), the group we
are working with, the representation r is labeled by n integers l1 to ln , satisfying

li < lj,

i < j.

(2)

the group element u (an n n unitary matrix) has n eigenvalues ei1 to ein . the character
r(u) is then

where

r(u) =

detneilj ko

j {eik }

,

j neiko = yj<k(cid:16)eij  eik(cid:17) .

the casimir c is a function of lis. in its simplest form, c has an expression

c(r) =

c(li),

n

xi=1

(3)

(4)

(5)

where c is an arbitrary function. here, we restrict ourselves to this form.

in the large-n limit, it is convenient to dene a set of scaled parameters yi, instead of

lis:

yi :=

li
n



1
2

.

(6)

in the same limit, also two density functions  and , corresponding to the distribution of
yis and is, respectively, are dened:

()

:=

(y)

:=

1
n

1
n

n

n

xj=1
xj=1

(  j)

(y  yj)

(7)

(8)

inserting (3), (4), and (5) in (1), using (6), and making some obvious redenition of the

function c, one arrives at

z = kxr

here we have dened

detnein yj 1

d{1

ko detnein yj 2
k}d{2
k}

en apk g(yk).

d{k} := yj<k

sin

j  k

,

and k is an unimportant constant.

to proceed, we use the change of variable

k := ik,

and rewrite (9) as

z = kxr

where

detnen yj 1

d{ 1

ko
ko detnen yj  2
k }d{ 2

en apk g(yk),

d{k} := yj<k

we can then use, along the line of [18],

z = ken 2f ,

and dierentiate it to obtain

(16)

in the large-n limit, one can of course omit the o(1/n 2) term (which contains higher
derivatives of f ). in this limit, one must also note the limiting behaviours

here we have used a density function ( ) instead of (), corresponding to the changeof

returning to (16), we dene

(20)


k

+ dk!l

s

.

here, the subscript s denotes that part of expression which contains only the derivatives of
dk, not dk itself. the rst equality simply comes from (d1)1n 1(/k)d1 = n 1(/k)+
dk. to obtain the second equality, one may consider a term with l factors of dk. there are
m!/[l!(m  l)!] ways to choose l factors of dk from m factors persent. the other dks, either
are dierentiated or are not present.

it may seem that this s part vanishes at the large-n limit, since it contains factors of
1/n. this is, however, not the case, since there are singular terms in dk at j  k. to
calculate the nonvanishing part of this expression, let us dene a generating function:

qk(u)

this is easily seen to be

(22)

the spart of this expression is contained in terms with small values for k  j. to obtain
this, we use

k  j 

,

(23)

k  j
n (k)

it
let j run from  to  (but j 6= k), and keep only the leading terms in k  j.
is easily seen that if one uses this prescription for dk itself, dk vanishes. so, using the
abovementioned prescription in (22) gives exactly qks(u), the spart of qk(u). that is,

qks(u) = yj6=k
= yj<k

so,

having found this, we return to (20) and arrive at

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

as a velocity eld, in correspondence with what dened in [18,19], one can combine (34) and
(35) into a generalized hopf equation:

v  i  = 




[g(v  i)]

(37)

2y2

in the case of ym2, where g(yk) = 1
k, this equation reduces to hopf equation found in
[18]. in this case, when one of the boundaries shrinks, so that one has a disc instead of a
cylinder, that is 2() = (), the itzyksonzuber integral can be used to obtain a solution
for the hopf equation and from that the critical area of the disc has been obtained [18]. in
our problem, gym2, we do not know such an integral representation.

3 the dominant representation

it is shown in [19] that the character r(u), can be written as

r(u) = en 2[,],

where, for large n,

[, ] = [, ] +

1

2 z dy y2(y) + b[].

here b is some functional of , and  satises a hamiltonjacobi equation


t

=

1

2 z dx (x)
  

x



!2



1
3

22(x)
 ,

in which the variable  satises the boundary conditions

and

(x, t = 0) = (x),

(x, t = 1) = (x),

dening v as the derivative of the momentum conjugate to , as in the previous section,
it is seen that the hamiltonjacobi equation (40) is equivalent to the following evolution
equation for  and v .

(38)

(39)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)


t

 

= 0,


x

where

and v = 
y


 .

 := v + i.

using (39) in (1) and (12), we see that in the largen limit, the dominant representation

satises the following saddlepoint equation

8

or


y

i
(y)

xi

= ag(y),


y

(y)

xi

= ag(y) xi

y,

where the summation is over boundaries. now recall (37). rewriting it as

where

f +




g( f) = 0,

f := v  i,

one can write an implicit solution to (47) as

f (, b) = f {  (b  a)g[f (, b)], a},

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

where a and b are two particular values of the time variable (here, actually the area). the
same thing can be done to solve (43). in fact, one can dene two functions h + and h  as

and

h +(x) := x  (t  t )(x, t ),

h (x) := x + (t  t )(x, t),

(50)

(51)

and see that  is a solution to (43) if these two functions are inverses of each other, i.e.
h [h +(x)] = x [19].

as an ansatz for h  (with t = 1 and t = 0), we take

and

where

h 
i

:= aig + i,

h +
i

:= vi  ii
= fi

f (x) = f0{x  aig[ fi(x)]}.

(52)

(53)

(54)

here ai is the area between a curve for which f is f0 and the i-th boundary. the meaning
of (52) and (53) is that we are seeking a solution to (43) with boundary conditions

vi(x, 1) = aig(x)  x,

(55)

9

and

for such a solution, (46) is obviously satised.

it is now easily seen that

(x, 0) = (x).

h 

i [h +

i (x)] = aig[ fi(x)] + i( f0{x  aig[ fi(x)]}).

if f0(x) is the inverse of i,

then we have

i[ f0(x)] = x,

h 

i [h +

i (x)] = x,

(56)

(57)

(58)

(59)

so (46) is satised if  satises (58). but f0 is generally a complex function, whereas 

should be real. it is now better to return to the earlier variables  and . we have

so (58) can be written as

where

i(i) = ().

[if0(x)] = x,

f := v  i.

(60)

(61)

(62)

the argument of  in (61) is real if v0 is zero. so, if there exits a loop on the surface, for
which the velocity eld is zero, then there exists a dominant representation , satisfying

[0()] = .

(63)

this is the same as that obtained in [18]. note, however, that the equation governing the
evolution of , (37), is dierent from the corresponding equation in [18].
