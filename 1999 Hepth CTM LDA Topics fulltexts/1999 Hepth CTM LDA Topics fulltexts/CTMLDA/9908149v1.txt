abstract

we analyze the high temperature (or classical) limit of the casimir eect (for various
massless elds). a simple physical argument suggests that the casimir energy (as opposed to the
casimir free energy) should vanish in the classical limit. we check the validity of this argument
for massless scalar eld conned in a cavity with boundaries of arbitrary shape, using path inte-
gral formalism. we are able to verify this suggestion only when the boundaries consist of disjoint
pieces. in fact, in such cases, that part of the casimir energy which depends on the separation of
the disjoint boundary pieces, decays exponentially with temperature and separation. moreover,
we nd in these cases that the contribution to the casimir entropy by eld modes that depend
on that separation, tends, in the classical limit, to a nite asymptotic value which depends only
on the geometry of the cavity. thus the casimir force between disjoint pieces of the boundary
in the classical limit is entropy driven and is governed by a dimensionless number characterizing
the arbitrary geometry of the cavity. contributions to the casimir thermodynamical quantities
due to each individual connected component of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in
temperature from the behavior just described. these logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to
our diculty to separate the casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical quantities) from
the electromagnetic self-energy of each of the connected components of the boundary in a well
dened manner. our approach to the casimir eect is not to impose sharp boundary conditions
on the uctuating eld, but rather take into consideration its interaction with the plasma of
charge carriers in the boundary, with the plasma frequency playing the role of a physical uv
cuto. this also allows us to analyze deviations from a perfect conductor behavior.

1 introduction

there has been considerable interest in the casimir eect [1] lately[2]. recent discus-

sions of this eect and its variants range over several areas of physics [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].

for recent books and reviews see [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. for earlier accounts see [15, 16].

the experimental status of the eect was tenuous until 1997 when vindication of

the theoretical prediction to an accuracy of a few percent was reported [17].

over the years, various methods have been applied to analyze the casimir eect.

to name a few, we mention the mode summation technique [10, 11, 15, 16] (which

was the method originally used by casimir), analyses of greens functions and of the

energy-momentum tensor in the presence of boundaries [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] and

zeta function techniques [25, 26]. these techniques posess exibility which permits,

among other things, the handling of temperature dependence (in vacuum and in

dielectrics) [18, 19, 24, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32], of elds with nite mass [29, 33], various

geometrical setups [4, 5, 6, 20, 22, 23, 30, 31, 34, 35], and a better insight into the

casimir force (macroscopic) in relation to microscopic long range forces [12].

in particular, we mention here the path integral approach [4, 5, 6, 36] which

seems to be well suited to handle systems with boundaries of arbitrary shape as well

as systems with moving boundaries [37].

an important aspect of the casimir eect is its behavior at nite temperatures.

finite temperature studies were carried out by several authors, e.g., [18, 19, 24, 27,

28, 29, 30, 32]. yet, to our knowledge, the classical (i.e., high temperature) limit of

the eect, has not been claried to date. we address this limit in this paper.

to get oriented, let us briey review (hopefully in a self contained manner) the

standard casimir problem, viz., radiation eld conned between two parallel conduct-

ing plates, at zero and nite temperature. we will write down explicit expressions

for the casimir energy, free energy and entropy. these are displayed in fig. 1, which

gives the behavior of these quantities for all temperatures. at the end of this sec-

tion we will discuss the classical limit of the casimir eect in this simple geometry.

1

(readers familiar with these standard aspects of the casimir eect may skip ahead

directly to the next section, but are urged to take a look in fig. 1 on the way.) in

appendix c we present an alternative treatment of this problem, based on the path

integral formalism, following closely [4, 6].

for simplicity, we will employ, for the rest of this section, the so called mode

summation technique. (for more details see, e.g., [8, 10, 11, 15, 16]. here we follow

clesely [8].) we consider the radiation eld (in 3 + 1 space-time dimensions) conned

between two conducting parallel plates. (in later sections, where we discuss the high

temperature limit of the casimir eect for cavities of arbitrary shapes, we will limit

ourselves to massless scalar elds for simplicity.) the sizes of the plates edges are l.

the parallel plates coincide with the planes at z = 0 and z = d. we are interested of
course in the case where l >> d, and in the end will take the limit l  .

the energy tied down in zero point uctuations in the mode k is, in obvious

notation (k includes the polarization and the zero in the argument relates to t = 0),

ek(0) =

(1)

the total energy density of the em eld with the conducting plates as boundaries

is (k is the magnitude of the wave vector perpendicular to the z axis, i.e., parallel

to the plates [16])

the casimir energy density, at t = 0, in dimensionless units, is given by

c(0) = (0)  (0).

(5)

(6)

both (0) and (0) diverge. c is commonly [1, 10, 15] evaluated by a physically

justiable regularization technique. thus a wave vector dependent function, r(k/kc),
is introduced into the above integrals such that for k >> kc r  0 while r  1 for
k << kc, thereby rendering the integrals convergent. a simple choice is ( = 1/kc),

r(k) = exp [k] .

(7)

 is allowed to go to zero at the end of the calculations - for all the terms together -

thus the sum is regularized. the details of the calculations will not be given here

(cf.

[8, 15, 16].)

in appendix c, where we present an alternative analysis of this

problem, we employ a dierent regularization scheme for the casimir energy, which

seems to us more natural physically.

the result for our case is

the nite temperature problem is quite similar. now the zero point energy is

supplemented by the thermal energy. thus the (average) energy tied down in the

(11)

(12)

returning to our dimensionless units we may write the energy density as a sum of a

zero temperature part plus a temperature dependent part:

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

observe that for dimensional reasons, (d, t ), u(d, t ) and n(y, t ) (as well as all the

other thermodynamical quantities which we will dene below) depend on d and t
only through the combination t d  t /tc. thus, in particular, (d, t = 0) = (0) is
independent of d.

we see from (15) that tc plays the role of a characteristic (or lower cuto) tem-

perature of the geometrical setting, separating high and low temperatures. the cor-

responding expression for the unconstrained system is

(, t ) = (0) + u(, t ),

(17)

with

u(, t ) =

evaluating the sum in (14) via the poisson summation formula [8, 15] gives ( = 2m)

(18)

as a consistency check we observe that for t << 1, c  c(0), the expression
in (8). the nite temperature casimir energy, c(t), i.e. the expectation value of the

hamiltonian of the constrained system with that of the unconstrained one subtracted

from it, is displayed in fig.1.

the casimir free energy is calculated as follows: the partition function (for one

mode) is

zk =



xn=1

exp [hk(n + 1/2)] =

and thus the free energy for the k-th mode is

exp [hk/2]
1  exp [hk]

,

fk = kbt log zk =

2

hk + kbt log(1  exp [hk]) .

(19)

(20)

hence the expression for the free energy density of the constrained system is,

f (d, t ) = e(d, 0) + kbt

(21)

a corresponding equation holds for the unconstrained system thereby leading to the

dimensionless expression for the casimir free energy density, c, given by

where d was dened in (3), and

fc(t ) = dc(t),

c(t) = 2t

(22)

(23)

the casimir free energy, c(t), is displayed in fig. 1. as a check, note that for
t << 1, c(t)  c(0), as it should.

5

at this juncture it is natural to consider casimirs entropy [8, 19]. this entropy,

c(t), in our dimensionless units is dened by

c(t) = c(t)  tc(t).

(24)

c(t) is displayed in fig. 1.

at high temperatures, t >> 1, c(t) falls o exponentially with t, c(t) approaches

a constant value (independent of t and, of course, of h) while c(t) becomes propor-

tional to t. (an explicit calculation of this behavior is deferred to appendix a.) re-

expressing these results in standard physical dimensions we get, at this limit (t >> 1)

ec  0, fc  tsc, sc

(25)

thus the entropy is proportional to the area of the plates scaled by d2. in view of

this fact we conclude that in the classical limit (high temperatures) the casimir force

is purely entropic.

figure 1: casimirs energy c (a), free energy c (b), and entropy c (c) as a
function of temperature, t.

it is clear from fig.1 that the casimir energy vanishes at high temperatures (and

according to (18) it vanishes exponentially fast). in fact, it becomes unobservale on

6

the scale of fig. 1, for t  0.8, i.e., for temperatures t  0.25tc (see section 3,
following (77)). this, we contend, characterizes the classical limit where the energy

equipartition theorem and the validity of the one to one correspondence between

the states of the constrained system and the states of the unconstrained system imply

this result. this is discussed in more detail in section 2.

this concludes the general introductory review. the rest of the paper is organized

as follows. section 2 includes the central point of the paper, viz., an exposition of

the classical limit and a study of its implications. it is based on the argument that

the known [7] one to one correspondence between states of constrained systems and

essentially free ones implies the vanishing of the casimir energy, but not the casimir

entropy, in the classical limit.

in section 3 we study, in the path integral formalism, the casimir eect associated

with a massless scalar eld (x) (as a simple analog of the electromagnetic eld),

conned in a static reecting cavity of arbitrary shape. section 3 is divided into

several subsections. in section 3.1 we study the zero temperature eect. first, we

review the formalism of [4, 6] assuming sharp boundary conditions on all frequency

modes (section 3.1.1). these boundary conditions on the eld modes are of course an

approximate macroscopic manifestation of the interaction of the plasma of charge

carriers that live in the conducting boundary, with the eld , in the limit that the

boundary is a perfect conductor. thus, in section 3.1.2 we adopt a more realistic

approach and take into account the susceptibility of the boundary medium, with

its plasma frequency p playing the role of a physical uv cuto.

in the limit of

innite p, we recover, of course, the eect of sharp boundary conditions. however,

by keeping p large but nite, we can also calculate corrections to the casimir eect

due to deviations from perfect conductor behavior.

in section 3.2 we discuss the

nite temperature case. the relevant temperature range is kbt << hp. in section

3.2.1 we study the classical limit kbtc < kbt << hp, where tc is a lower (ir) cuto

temperature analogous to (16). for this model, we are able to verify the arguments

of section 2, that the classical limit for this system results in a vanishing casimir

7

energy and a geometry dependent casimir entropy, only when the boundaries are

made of disjoint pieces. we nd that contributions to the casimir free enrgy, energy

and entropy due to each connected component of the boundary individually exhibit

logarithmic deviations in temperature from the behavior just described, which seems

to be in accordance with similar conclusions in [30].

in the conclusions which are given in section 4 we review the argument (cf. [10])

for the existence of zero point uctuations as viewed from our vantage point.

some technical details are deferred to the appendices. in appendix a we provide

an explicit calculation of the exponential fall-o of c(t) seen in fig.1 (which we

mentioned following eq.(24). we show that a naive high temperature expansion for

the casimir energy in powers of 1/t does not have any corrections to the classical

value.

in appendix b we verify the consistency of p(t = 0) as a uv cuto at

high temperatures. appendix c provides a derivation of the casimir eect for the

canonical parallel plate geometry via the path integral formalism of section 3. we

obtain all the results of section 1 at zero and nite temperature, as well as the classical

limit. appendix d contains some technical details concerning bounds on terms in a

certain expansion we carry out in section 3.

8

2 the classical limit - discussion

an intuitive understanding of the vanishing of the casimir energy for t > tc ( cf. fig.

1) may be gained via the following reasoning. loosely speaking [7] the total number of

normal modes (per unit volume) in our conned system is unchanged upon changing

d (in the case under study in section 1).1 thus moving the walls adiabatically leads to

shifts in the levels - not to appearance (or disappearance) of levels (modes), and there

is an (intuitive) one to one correspondence between the levels regardless of the size of

d. this, coupled with the classically valid equipartitioning of energy, which of course

means that each harmonic oscillator like mode holds kbt amount of energy, implies

that the (bulk) energy density (in this classical limit) is unchanged upon changing d.

thus, in the classical limit, dened by the validity of the rayleigh jeans (rj) law

or the equipartioning of the energy [38], the dierence in the energy density between
the constrained (d << l) and the unconstrained (d  l) cases, namely, the casimir
energy, is nil.

thus we have, in conformity with the result of the exact calculations as exhibited

in fig. 1, that,

c(d, t ) = 0.

lim
t

tc

(26)

these considerations are readily generalizable to cavities of arbitrary shapes, as we

demonstrate in the next section.

in discussions of black body radiation, kirchhos law (that the ratio of emissiv-

ity to absorptivity of all bodies is a universal function of the wavelengh  and the

temperature t ) is used [10] to infer that u, the total electromagnetic energy density

in a cavity at thermal equilibrium, is a function of t only, u = u(t ). it is clear that

this is true only for t > tc where tc is a characteristic temperature of the cavity (cf.

(16)). (e.g., at t = 0 it is, strictly speaking, never true.) for this reason we refer to

(26) as kirchhos theorem.

1the calculations of appendix a constitute an explicit proof of this claim (within the regular-

ization scheme employed there).

the cavity, is

where () is the (extensive) density of modes. thus, for photons (inside a very large

the previous section[7]

() = (c/d)f ree()"1/2 +

xn=1

and so on.

long ago, h. weyl [39], proved that for cavities of large volume v , the integrated

mode density n() =



r0

()d (for a spinless particle) behaves asymptotically as

n() =

v 3
62c3 ,

(28)

independently of the shape of the cavity (provided the boundary satises appropriate

regularity conditions). weyls result is the leading term in an asymptotic expansion

of n() (properly smoothed out) in inverse powers of v 1/3/c [31].

thus, in evaluating the casimir entropy in the classical limit (which is the dier-

ence in the entropies, at high temperature, of the entropies of the constrained and

the free systems), according to (27) and weyls theorem, we expect the dominant

contribution to s, the volume term (28), to cancel between the constrained and the

unconstrained systems. this is consistent, of course, with physical intuition, because

at such temperatures the dominant contribution is from the short wavelength modes
(  1/t ). these are insensitive to the boundaries when the dimension of the cavity
much exceeds these wavelengths [40]. the contribution to the casimir entropy, then,

is essentially determined by the long wavelengths which are geometry dependent, i.e.,

which relate to the shape of the cavity and are independent of temperature. it fol-

lows then that the casimir free energy is proportional to temperature. this reasoning

10

is born out by the explicit calculational results presented in the next section and in

appendix a. hence we see that this, viz., the free energy being proportional to t, is

not at all related to the rj law - the latter relates to the energy.

we are now in a position to interpret the zero point energy (zpe) as a contribution

necessary to assure that at high temperatures , the energy, u, is a function of t only

as, indeed, was noted long ago (1913) by einstein and stern ([10], p.2): without it

the energy will depend on the boundaries. alternatively, if we assume the validity

of kirchhos theorem at high temperatures, we may deduce the zero temperature

casimir energy as follows.

let us write the energy per mode k of the radiation eld as

ek(t ; tc) = ek(0; tc) + e

k(t ; tc)

(29)

where e

k is the energy held in the mode without the zpe. (tc refers to the constraints,
if present. we tacitly assume that tc is the maximal parameter of this kind, if several

such parameters are needed to describe the cavity.) for an allowed mode k

e

k(t ; tc) =

hk

exp(hk)  1

(see (11)). the casimir energy is then,

ec(t ; tc) = xk

ek(t ; tc) xk

ek(t ).

(30)

(31)

use of (29) ( i.e., separating the thermal energy from the vacuums) and kirchhos

theorem (26) implies

e

lim

k(t ) + ec(0)# = 0.
with ec(0) being the casimir energy at zero temperature. hence

(32)

(33)

now both terms in the square bracket are readily calculable - their temperature

dependence assures convergence - and thus yield the casimir energy at t = 0 without

recourse to a (perhaps) objectionable regularization scheme.

12

3 classical limit for arbitrary geometry

our discussion of the classical limit of the casimir eect concentrated so far on

one concrete example, namely, the parallel plates geometry. however, the intuitive

physical argument presented in the previous section for the vanishing of the casimir

energy in the classical limit is quite general and does not seem to depend in any specic

manner on the geometric details of the parallel plates system. thus, we expect that

it should be possible to supplement this argument by an explicit calculation of the

clasical limit of the casimir eect for a cavity of arbitrary shape.

in this section

we carry out such a calculation, using path integration techniques. some technical

details are deferred to appendices b-d. from this point onward, we reset h, c and kb

to 1, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

3.1 zero temperature analysis

in order to set up the formalism we start with the zero temperature case. for sim-

plicity, we concentrate on a real massless scalar eld with action

s = z d4x

1
2

((x))2 ,

(34)

instead of the electromagnetic eld.

(discussion of the electrodynamical casimir

eect follows essentially the same lines.) we assume that the eld is conned within

a static cavity of an arbitrary shape and is constrained to vanish on its boundary

, which may consist of several disjoint pieces.

in addition, we assume that the

curvature of  is regular everywhere.

3.1.1 sharp boundary conditions over all modes

following [4, 6], we parametrize the world-volume swept out by our static  as

x0 = t; x = x(u)

(35)

where u = (u1, u2) are internal coordinates on .

13

the in-vacuum to out-vacuum transition amplitude z associated with (34) with

(x) constrained to vanish on (35) is given by

zc =

1

z0 z d yx

 [(t, x(u))] exp

i

2 z d4x ()2

with normalization

z0 = z d exp

i

2 z d4x ()2 .

(36)

(37)

we chose to normalize (36) relative to the unconstrained system, since after all, we

are interested only in the dierence of the ground state energies.

following [4] we write

 [(t, x(u))] = z d(t, u) exp iz dt z

yx

d2ug(t, u) (t, x(u)) .

(38)

here

g =   x

u1!2  x

is the determinant of the induced metric on .

since  is static, it is convenient to resolve  and  into frequency modes as

(x) eit

and (t, x) =



z

d

(x) eit

(40)

(with

substituting (38) in (36) and using (40) we have

(41)

we may summarize (38) and (41) by saying that the  act as sources for the 
,
which lives on . integration over these sources constrains all modes  (i.e., low

frequency modes as well as high frequency modes) to vanish on . this is, obviously,

an idealized situation. e.g., if we try to take (34) more seriously as a simplied version

of the electrodynamical case. indeed, it is well known that real metals are transparent
to radiation of frequency   p, where p is the plasma frequency of the metal in

14

question (which typically lies in the uv region). low frequency modes (i.e., modes

with  < p), on the other hand, penetrate the surface of the conductor only to within

a distance of order 1/p (the skin depth) and are otherwise excluded from the bulk

of the conductor. thus, as is well known, the perfect conductor boundary condition

that all modes (x) vanish on , is an eective description (or a consequence) of the

microscopic interactions of  and its sources  in the medium, where we assume
p  . the plasma frequency p serves as an eective uv cuto frequency for the
casimir eect. in the next sub-section we will treat this issue in some detail. one

of the benets of doing so, besides gaining better physical understanding, is that the

formalism we follow will enable us to calculate deviations from a perfect conductor

behavior in a straight forward manner.

3.1.2 more realistic interactions at the boundary

thus, to make our model more realistic, we should really think of the conducting

surface  as having some thickness w of a few 1/p. (in doing so we make the tacit

assumption that local curvature radii anywhere on  are much larger than 1/p.)
we denote this thickened three dimensional conductor b. only modes of frequency
 < p are constrained to decay into b. modes of frequency  > p will not be
subjected to such a boundary condition. this physical behavior should be taken into

account in (41).

thus, we replace (34) by the action

s =

1

2 z d3xz d

2



(x)h2(, x) + 2i (x) ,

where, in analogy with electrodynamics, we introduced the dielectric function

(42)

(43)

with susceptibility (), which encodes the polarization eects due to the   
interactions in b.

(, x) = 


1 + 4(), x  b
x / b

1,

15

the cavity bounded by b has an ir cuto frequency c, which obviously sets the
scale for frequencies that dominate the casimir eect. we assume henceforth that

the ratio p/c is large but nite so as to leave a wide window open between the two

cuto frequencies. for the parallel plate capacitor of section 1, with plate separation

d, we have of course

c = /d .

(44)

then the condition p/c = pd/ >> 1 means that we are allowed to use the perfect

conductor boundary conditions only for plate separation d in the range

d >> 0.06m  10ev

hp ! .

(45)

if we decrease the plates separation d below what is allowed by (45), c would tend

to p until it would eventually cross it over. field modes around c would penetrate

yet deeper into the boundary, until it would become eectively transparent to these

modes, rendering the boundary conditions less eective. thus, we expect that if our
modied model (as given by (42) and (43)) could still be trusted when p/c  1,
then the 1/d4 behavior of the casimir force (10) would crossover to a less divergent
behavior. in fact, assuming (46) for (), we can show that the casimir force behaves
like 1/d3 for d below the range allowed by (45) [27] (see also [10], p.230).

current experiments are performed (albeit not in the parallel plate geometry)
with d  0.1m[17]. obviously, it would be interesting to check experimentally
(when technology would allow performing such experiments) how the casimir force

behaves at such much smaller distances (which are yet large enough on the atomic

scale).

in addition to (45), we assume that c is large enough, so that for   c we may

16

neglect all resonances and dissipative eects encoded in , and thus write2

4() =

p

(46)

in direct analogy with the theory of dielectrics. (in reality, this corresponds to fre-

quencies in the infrared and higher. in the case of the parallel plate capacitor, tuning

c to the infrared, means plate separation d around 1m.)

with (46) for , the action (42) is equivalent to

from (47) that in the limit p   of a perfect conductor, (x) tends to vanish on

()  1 = 4() in (42) is, of course, the greens function (at k = 0) of the
source eld  (already mentioned in (41)), that lives in b. thus, (42) is equivalent
to

thus, we replace (41) by

(49)

(50)

2following elementary dispersion theory, we may take (as the simplest example) () =
/( + i). the simple pole at  = 0 corresponds, of course, to b being a conductor, with con-
ductivity  and damping coecient  = 2
p/4. our second assumption is simply that c >> .
more generally, we assume that c is much bigger than the highest resonance frequency and largest
damping coecient appearing in . finally, note that the analytic structure of () insures that
the path integral over (42) is well dened, namely, re(is) < 0 always.

3long ago, anderson [43] pointed out that the electrodynamical analogs of (47) and (48) may serve
as a low energy, non-relativistic example of dynamical mass generation of gauge elds, analogous to
mass generation in the schwinger model or to the higgs phenomenon.

with (46), the quadratic piece in  in (49) is +||2/2

perfect conductor, +||2/2
back into , and (50) reduces to (41) (as we already commented following (48)).

p. in the limit p   of a
p goes away, the thickened conducting surface b shrinks

observe that in our discussion of the casimir eect in sections 1 and 2, and in this

section up to (41), we did not make any reference to the ne structure constant  (or
its analog, associated with the  coupling in b). however, since 2
p is proportional
to , it rightfully sneaks into our discussion following the modied action (42), or

equivalently, (49). given this, we should, in principle, include the  interaction (or

analogously, the photon-electron interactions) also in the bulk part of the action in

(49), taking into account the full dynamics of the source eld . this would imply

using below the renormalized  (or photon) propagator in the bulk (for such radiative

corrections in the casimir eect see e.g.,[36]). however, such eects are small and we

ignore them in this paper.

eqs. (49) and (50) capture some aspects of the dynamics of  (and thus, in a

sense, of the dynamics of the boundaries where  lives), rendering our formalism more

realistic as it relaxes the constraints on higher frequency modes and thus regularizes

the theory. one aspect of this regularization is that the two dimensional surface
 becomes fuzzy and swells into a shell b of nite width.
should also mention a recent work by ford and svaiter [9] which also takes boundary

in this context we

dynamics into consideration, but in a dierent (and presumably complimentary) way.

in [9] the boundary as a whole is quantized - its location serves as a collective heavy

coordinate which sits in its ground state (at t = 0) and is thus not sharply dened.

this quantum uncertainty in the boundary location also regularizes the thoery since it

cures an old problem having to do with divergences of the energy density near sharply

dened boundaries (see e.g. the work by candelas and deutsch (1979) in [37]). the

idea is simple: if the eld vanishes on a sharply dened surface, its momentum at all

points on the surface is unbounded due to the uncertainty principle, rendering the

18

eld energy density singular on the surface. if the location of the boundary has zero

point uctuations, the eld at the (fuzzy) boundary is not sharply constrained, and

the eld energy density is no longer singular.

in the spirit of [4, 6] we would like now to integrate  out of (50). to this end it

is useful to extend the denition of the sources  from b into all space as

(x)  


(x), x  b
x / b .

0,

(52)

in terms of these extended sources, clearly all spatial integrals in (49) involving ,

including the  interaction term, are carried over all space. thus, integrating 
out is straightforward and produces a factor z0, which cancels the corresponding
normalization factor in (50). we end up with

in order to proceed, we recall at this point that b is essentially the thickened
two dimensional conducting surface , with normal width w of a few skin depths
l/p (l  o(1)). thus, we parametrize b by

x = x(u, w) ,

where u are the two internal coordinates of  (see (35)), and w is the coordinate in

the direction normal to . we are interested, of course, in limit of large p, or very

small width w. clearly, in this limit  (as well as ) do not uctuate in the normal

direction. consequently we may write the -quadratic action in (53) as

here t (implicit in the product in the rst line of (57)), is a temporal ir cuto which
arises due to time translational invariance. the prime to the right of the product

thus integration over it yields a square root of the appropriate determinant. this is
taken care of in the last expression in (57), where we used m = m. the casimir

eq. (58) is one of our main results and we will use it to infer the classical (high

([4] actually discusses the most generic case where the eld lives in d + 1 dimensions

and is constrained to vanish on several manifolds  of various dimensions, some

of which may be time dependent.)

in particular, for the parallel plate geometry

discussed in the previous sections (1 is the z = 0 plane and 2 is the z = d plane),

a straight forward calculation yields [4, 6]

(62)

if we let p tend to innity in (58) we obtain the casimir energy of the perfect

conductor , identical (up to an innite additive constant proportional to the area

of ) to the casimir energy one may calculate directly from (41).

in particular,

substituting (61) in (58) yields (after proper regularization) the casimir energy (8).

however, keeping p large but nite, we may calculate corrections to the casimir

eect due to imperfect conductor behavior by expanding (58) in inverse powers of p.

such calculations were made in [28] using greens function techniques. in appendix

c, following [4, 6] (and the formalism presented in this section), we briey sketch

the calculation of the casimir force at zero and nite temperatures for the parallel

plate capacitor using (61). we also calculate in appendix c the leading (in 1/p)

correction to the casimir eect due to imperfect conductor behavior for the parallel

plate capacitor, which coincides with the results of [28] and [44].

3.2 finite temperature behavior and the classical limit

the nite temperature case is obtained, in the usual manner, from the zero temper-

ature case of the previous sub-section, by continuing  to imaginary values, where

21

mn(u, u) = qg(u)

e|n| |x(u)x(u)|

4 |x(u)  x(u)| qg(u) ,

(63)

it can take only the discrete matsubara frequencies n = 2n/. consequently, we



replace continuous integrals

n= (with  = 1/t ).
obviously, since p plays the role of a uv cuto, we must sum only over |n| < p.
we show in appendix b that the physics of the electron fermi gas in the metal

d/2 by discrete sums (1/)p

r

actually warrants 1 << p, so that these discrete sums include many terms, and

also that we may ignore the t dependence of p. these facts indicate that our

cuto procedure, using (43) and (46) is physically consistent also at nite and high

temperatures.

under the analytic continuation   i, the oscillatory exponentials in (54) and
(56) are replaced by decaying exponentials. thus for nite temperature we replace
m by

(as well as a similar replacement for m
 in (60)). we also introduce the obvious
notational replacement m  mn. note that in the euclidean domain, mn is not
only symmetric, but also real.

in particular, note that at nite temperature, we must replace (61) and (62) of

the parallel plate capacitor by

mn =   1
edhn

1 ! 1

(64)

with hn = q2

n  2

finally, we analytically continue (57) to imaginary  (and also replace t   in

(57)) and obtain the partition function as



zc = yn0

xn=

thus, the casimir free energy (the analytic continuation of (58)) is

(65)

3.2.1 the classical limit

our main interest in this paper is of course the high temperature, classical limit of the

casimir eect. recall from section 1 (see in particular fig. 1) that for the parallel

plate capacitor (and electromagnetic elds), the classical limit is

ec  0, fc  tsc, sc 

(3)
23

(

l2
d2 )

(namely, (25), which we repeat here for convenience). as discussed in section 2, it is

supposed to become valid for temperatures t >> tc, where tc = hc/kbd (see (16))

is a temperature scale dened by geometry. (in practice, as can be seen in fig. 1, this
behavior starts already for t  tc/4.) since p is our uv cuto, it is clear that the
relevant temperature range must be far below hp (which corresponds to  105 ok),

kbtc < kbt << hp ,

(67)

which is consistent with the condition p/c >> 1 (eq. (45)) and also in accordance

with the discussion in appendix b.

according to the general discussion in section 2, we would expect this behavior to

be generic, and occur for cavities of arbitrary shape. thus, we expect that there be a

temperature scale, which we also denote by tc, which is determined by the geometry

of the cavity, in analogy with (16), and marks the onset of the classical limit.

in the rest of this section we prove this excpectaion for cavities whose boundaries

consist of several disjoint pieces, and also set a bound on tc. cavities bounded by a

single connected boundary are in principle more dicult to handle in this respect, for

reasons that we shall explain below. in fact, for such cavities, we found logarithmic

corrections to (25), which seem to be consistent with results of balian and duplantier

[30].

we see from (63) that mn(u1, u2) decays exponentially fast, unless

n |x(u1)  x(u2)|  1 .

(68)

in particular, it is clear from (63) and (the analytic continuation of )(60), that for

where d is the minimal distance between the disjoint pieces  and .

thus, if t = 1/2 is such that 1dmin > 1, where dmin is the minimal d, then
n (for any pair  6= ) will be exponentially small. below
n make exponentially small contribution to the casimir free

(70)

the o-diagonal blocks of (64) are a clear example of this behavior, for which we

can write the operatorial inequality

2n

(71)

indeed, as we show at the end of appendix c, the high temperature behavior of (71)

oers a very simple explanation of the exponential decay of the casimir energy c(t)

mentioned following (24) (which we derive in appendix a using a laborious mode

summation), and of its corrolary that the bulk number of modes per unit volume is

independent of d.

the diagonal blocks of (64) obviously decay only as powers of 1/n. this is in

fact true in general, as we now show. according to (68) we should consider only
neighboring points x(u)  x(u + a), which means that they must belong to the
same  (assuming nite dmin, of course). by continuity then |x(u)  x(u + a)|2

(74)

eq. (74) is an asymptotic formula for n  , so for 1/dmin < n << p we
might still have to include many subleading corrections to (74), but the point is that

the diagonal blocks decay only as powers of 1/n.

n

to summarize, when t is high enough so that (70) holds, the o-diagonal blocks
m
( 6= ) become exponentially small (for n 6= 0) , and are thus dominated by
the power-like decaying blocks. thus, it makes sense to split mn (n 6= 0) into its
diagonal and o-diagonal pieces

mn = mn,d + mn,od

(75)

(in obvious notations).

this splitting is not only according to the dierent asymptotic behavior of mn,d
and mn,od at large n, but also according to their dierent physical interpretations:
consider for simplicity, a boundary  which is the union of just two disjoint con-

nected pieces 1 and 2. (the following discussion may be generalized immediately

to an arbitrary set of disjoint boundaries .) assume that 1 and 2 are innitely

separated at rst, and thus do not interact. clearly, in this case, the only non van-
ishing blocks of m are the diagonal ones m11 and m22, that encode the interaction
of the eld  and the corresponding boundary 1 and 2, respectively. by denition,
m11 depends only on the details of 1 and m22 depends only on the details of 2. in
addition, note that the matrix elements dening m11 and m22 (see(56)) are mani-
festly invariant under three dimensional rotations and translations. thus, the spectra
of m11 and m22 are invariant under rigid rotations and translations of 1 and 2,
respectively. then, as 1 and 2 are brought closer together, they start interacting,
and the o-diagonal blocks m12 and m21, which encode this mutual interaction, are

25

no longer vanishing. as 1 and 2 are drawn closer, the o-diagonal blocks clearly

become larger, while the diagonal blocks remain unchanged. (we could have invoked,
of course, this argument to split m into diagonal and o-diagonal blocks also at
t = 0.) the parallel plate capacitor, with m given by (64), provides a very simple
example for this discussion.

given our system with boundaries 1 and 2, we may study its behavior under in-

nitesimal perturbations. we can perturb the system in two independent ways. one

possibility is to slightly deform any one of the two boundaries (or both), but other-

wise keep the state of the plates relative to each other unchanged. (an innitesimal

self-similar rescaling is an example of such a deformation.) the second possibility

is to move the boundaries rigidly relative to each other, that is, to make a relative

translation or rotation, without changing their shapes. according to the discussion

above, perturbations belonging to the rst possibility will induce changes in the diag-

onal blocks and also in the o-diagonal blocks. perturbations belonging to the second

possibility aect only the o-diagonal blocks. the gradients of the free energy (66)

(or of the casimir energy (58) at t = 0) with respect to these deformations yield the

corresponding casimir forces. again, this is all very clear for the example of the two

plate capacitor.

computation of the energy associated exclusively with the diagonal blocks of m,
that is, the energy of the constrained system with 1 and 2 ininitely far apart, poses
some conceptual diculties.5 consider for example 1. its interaction with the eld
 gives rise to the divergent (cuto dependent) quantity tr log m11, which we may
interpret as the energy needed to assemble 1. this energy includes the divergent

self-energy of the charges that make 1 (which is, by denition, a short distance

eect ), and interactions among patches of charges on much larger distance scales. it

is the latter that contains the casimir energy we sought. then a conceptual question

arises how to dene a nite physically sensible casimir energy, separate it from the
self-energy and thus extract it from the divergent tr log m11 of 1. as an example,

5we adapt here a discussion in the unpublished notes mentioned in [6].

26

consider 1 to be a spherical shell of radius r (an example that has been and is being

studied extensively in the literature [3, 20, 22, 23, 30, 34, 35, 42]). one may attempt

to dene its casimir energy by comparing the shell with radius r with another shell

with a much larger radius. but as we inate the shell of radius r to compare it

with the other shell, each point on the shell recedes from all the other points on the

shell. in particular, innitesimally separated points on the sphere will recede from one

another too. thus, inating the sphere aects interactions over all distance scales,

and in particular, on the scale of the uv cuto - that is, the self-energy. on top of it

all, and related to the diculty of separating the casimir energy from the self-energy,

there is the more practical question of how to separate the casimir force acting on

our isolated 1 from the total surface tension (and other similar eects), in order to

measure it. this is to be contrasted with what happens when we rigidly move 1

and 2 relative to each other. then all points in 1 move relative to all points on

2, but there is no movement of points within the same , i.e., there is no change of

the self-energy of each of the boundaries. such moves thus induce clear cut changes

in the casimir energy of the system [6].

having split m into diagonal and o-diagonal blocks according to (75) we expand

the free energy in powers of the o-diagonal part

tr log h1 + lp mni = tr log h1 + lp mn,di

lp

2

tr "

note that the linear term in mn,od is absent:

1 + lp mn,d

lp

1 + lp mn,d

mn,od# +    .

(76)

tr "

lp

1 + lp mn,d

mn,od# = 0 .

this expansion (76) is well behaved due to the exponential bound (69) on mn,od, as
we demonstrate in appendix d.

since the leading correction due to mn,od is quadratic, we see from (69) (and from
appendix d) that o-diagonal contributions become exponentially small at temper-

27

atures t such that 21dmin > 1. this is (70) alluded to above. thus, we expect from

(70) that tc be bounded from below

tc >

1

4dmin

.

(77)

for the parallel plate capacitor, with tc given by (16), this simply means the onset

of the classical limit already for t > tc/4, consistent with fig. 1.

given a conguration of disjoint boundaries , an interesting quantity is the cost

in free energy (or cost in energy, at t = 0) needed to assemble that conguration

from an initial conguration of the same boundaries, but innitely far apart. in other

words, we would like to study



fc =

1
2

xn= ntr log h1 + lp mni  tr log h1 + lp mn,dio ,

(78)

which, in view of the discussion above, is a well dened quantity, not plagued by

innite self-energy terms that cancel between the two terms on the right hand side of

(78).

for the parallel plate capacitor, fc (which we calculate in appendix c), is
precisely the casimir free energy (22) which was derived in section 1. thus, more

generally, we may interpret (78) as the the casimir free energy (or the casimir energy,

at t = 0) due to eld modes that depend explicitly on the mutual arrangements of

the disjoint boundaries. (such modes are to be contrasted, for example, with modes

that live inside any of the boundaries  which is a closed boundary enclosing a

cavity. when this  is a perfect conductor, the latter modes are disconnected from
the outer world, and will thus contribute exclusively to m.)

it is fc in (78) that in the classical limit t >> tc becomes proportional to t ,
with a proportionality coecient (minus the casimir entropy sc) which is determined
by geometry, in a similar manner to (25). indeed, from (69), (77) and from the explicit

bounds (d.1) and (d.2) in appendix d, we see immediately that for t > 1/(4dmin)
all terms in (78) with n 6= 0 are exponentially small relative to the contribution of
the zero mode. thus, in this limit

fc 

t

2 ntr log h1 + lp m0i  tr log h1 + lp m0,dio ,

(79)

28

with exponentially small corrections. this is the high temperature limit of the casimir
free energy. thus, as in (25), ec(t ), the casimir energy (or more precisely, the casimir
energy due to eld modes that depend explicitly on the mutual arrangements of the

disjoint boundaries) tends to zero exponentially fast (at least as fast as e21dmin).

thus,

sc = 

1

2 ntr log h1 + lp m0i  tr log h1 + lp m0,dio

(80)

is the asymptotic casimir entropy due to eld modes that depend explicitly on the

mutual arrangements of the disjoint boundaries. for (80) to make sense, its right hand

side must be positive. unfortunately, we were not able to give a general mathematical

proof that

tr log h1 + lp m0i < tr log h1 + lp m0,di

(81)

for an arbitrary arrangement of disjoint boundaries. thus, we content ourselves with a

physical argument that this inequality holds. the expressions in (80) are due to static

(or quasi static) , i.e., modes of  with large wavealalengths. thus, the dierence

inside the curly brackets in (80) is the -static (or electrostatic) energy dierence

between having the boundaries  close and having them innitely far apart. the

s are distinct neutral objects that attract one another due to van der waals

like forces (here, of course, we can neglect retardation eects). thus, we argue, the
energy dierence must be negative, and sc positive. in addition, note that if one could
argue that all matrix elements of m0,od are much smaller than all matrix elements of
m0,d (which seems to be plausible when all surfaces  are kept at distances larger
than their dimensions), then we could expand tr log h1 + lp m0i as we expanded
in (76) for n 6= 0. by calculating the trace in the eigenbasis of the diagonal blocks, we
see immediately that the leading correction in the expansion is negative, supporting

our claim that (81) holds.

we end this section with a remark concerning high temperature behavior of the
diagonal blocks of m. for n large, mn is dominated by its block diagonal part
mn,d and approaches the asymptotic form (74) 1/2n (up to power like corrections

29

in 1/n). thus, tr log h1 + lp mni tends to
2n! 1# = a log  1 +

tr log " 1 +

lp

lp

2n!  a log   lp

2n! ,

(82)

where a is the total area of all surfaces. thus, fc, the unsubtracted free energy (66),
unlike fc, will contain (roughly p/c) terms proportional to

at log(lpt ) .

these logarithmic deviations of fc from the asymptotic classical behavior expected
according to the general argument in section 2 seem to be consistent with the high

temperature behavior of the free energy discussed in section 6 of [30].

4 concluding remarks

this paper gives the classical - the high temperature - limit of the casimir eect.

as a start we studied the simple example of the radiation eld conned between

two innite parallel conducting plates separated by a distance d, and found that the

casimir energy vanishes (up to exponentially small corrections) in the classical limit.

from that observation we abstracted an argument that in the classical limit (de-

ned to be temperatures such that the rayleigh-jeans, i.e., energy equipartition,

theorem holds) kirchhos theorem is valid - i.e. the energy density of the radia-

tion eld is a function of the temperature only and this implies that, in this limit, the

casimir energy vanishes. we showed that the zero point energy is required to assure

the validity of kirchhos theorem in the classical limit. alternatively, assuming

the validity of the theorem allows the evaluation of the casimir energy at t = 0

without recourse to any regularization scheme. we noted, following [10], that these

results were anticipated by einstein and stern in 1913, prior to the formulation of

modern quantum mechanics and quantum eld theory. these authors noted that

the high temperature expansion of what we now term bose distribution function is

(h << 1)

h

exp(h)  1  kbt 

1
2

h + o(1/t ).

thus we have here a temperature independent term which contributes to the total

energy. its cancellation, i.e., the validity of kirchhos theorem in our presenta-
tion, requires a positive zero point energy, + 1

2h. thus the removal of the zero point
energy by considering a normally ordered hamiltonian does not eliminate the need

for zero point energy. the zero point energy is seen, according to einstein and stern,

to be required for the correct classical limit or, in our terminology, for the validity of

kirchhos theorem. this stems here from the form of the bose distribution rather

than the hamiltonian.

the study of the (casimir) free energy in the classical limit led to demonstrating

31

that the casimir entropy, is (in this limit) a temperature independent constant and

reects nite volume corrections in statistical physics. thereby the proportionality of

the free energy to the temperature, t that is well known [17] is seen not to be related

to the rayleigh jeans limit [20] but rather is a consequence of the perhaps interesting

result that the casimir force in the classical limit is purely entropic - in fact geometric.

it is thence predicted that large class of casimir free energies, in the high t limit,

will turn out to be proportional to the temperature - reecting the purely entropic

origin of the casimir force in this limit. the crucial point being the existance of one

to one correspondence between state of the constrained and unconstrained systems.

we veried the expeted classical limit for the casimir eect due to a massless

scalar eld constrained by a set of disjoint boundaries of arbitrary geometries. we

also studied corrections to the casimir eect due to deviations from perfect conductor

behavior.

appendix a: calculational details for section 1

in this appendix we evaluate the casimir energy through a power series expansion

in t (t   t
each term in the expansion. the result is that, within such an expansion, kirchhos

tc

theorem is exact.

i.e., the casimir energy vanishes to all orders in 1/t in this high

temperature expansion. this is interpreted as implying that the classical equipartition

theorem is robust - the classical approximation, once taken, is exact to within power

series corrections. we hasten to add that this is yet another example of incorrect

handling of innities which is further discussed at the end of this appendix.

let us return to the expression for the casimir energy density at nite temper-

(12) and (18), which, in our dimensionless units are summarized by

we now adjunct to each of the above integrals the standard [15, 16] cuto function,

f (xm) = exp [xm] ,

assuring thereby the convergence of the integrals. ( we are interested in the   0
limit.)

assuming the validity of this regularization scheme, we may expand ([41], p. 42),

and that b2n+1 = 0 (n  1), we get gp = 0 for p even, and for p odd,

.

returning to (a.1), we see that upon substituting (a.2) only terms with p even occur,

i.e., c(t ) = 0. this should be compared with the exponential decay of the casimir

energy with temperature that is implied by (18), and is depicted in fig. 1. this

robustness of the classical (erroneous) solution, i.e. the nonexistence of corrections

to this nil result, is worthy of note. it implies that the correct, low t expression,

(18), obtainable from the correct quantum statistical mechanical approach, cant be

obtained by analytic means (i.e., power series) from the high t expasnsion side.

the case of p = 0 in the above expansion will be recognized as the sum over the

constrained number of modes, per unit volume, with the unconstrained number de-

ducted therefrom. that the result is nil constitues a proof, based on a particular

regularization scheme, of the assertion (section 2) that the number of modes, per

unit volume, is unchanged upon varying the plates separation, d.

appendix b : consistency of the plasma dielectric function as a cuto

we used in section 3 the plasmon mode as a physical regulator (at zero and

at nite temperature) in our calculations, through the dielectric function (43) and

(46) associated with it. thus, in eect, we are thinking of the charge sources 
as electrons in a metallic conductor b. since the plasmon mode is a real physical
excitation in dielectrics, we expect it to be a consistent regulator. it is quite instructive

to show that this is indeed the case, especially in the nite temperature case. (for the

sake of clarity, we display in this appendix hs and kbs explicitly in the appropriate

places.)

as is well known,

p =

(b.1)

where n is the electron density. in most metals, where n/1023cm3 = o(1), hp is of
the order of 10ev, corresponding to temperatures of the order of 105 ok, well above

the melting point of any metal. it is also of the same order of magnitude of a typical

fermi energy

f =

of the electron gas in the metal. indeed, from (b.1) and (b.2) we have

(b.2)

(b.3)

which is o(1) for all metals.

the electron fermi gas is practically degenerate even well above the melting points

of all metals, and thus

kbt << f

(b.4)

in all our considerations. only electrons with energies close to the fermi energy of

the gas contribute to transport.6 the electron fermi gas and the gas of photons in
6recall that the behavior of the gas is governed by  = 3n  (120, 000ok/t )3/2 (n/1023cm3),
where  = q2h2/mekbt is the thermal wave length. for typical metals n/1023cm3 = o(1).

thus, for t << 120, 000ok, we have  >> 1, which means that the gas is in a high density and low
temperature state.

35

the cavity are in thermal equilibrium. thus, in the present context, and due to (b.3),

h1  2kbt << hp

(b.5)

as well. the frequency cuto normally allows many matsubara modes.

it is the

physics of the electron fermi gas in the metal that implies that kbt be much smaller

than hp. happily enough we need not worry about the fermi gas becoming appre-

ciably non-degenerate. thus, in particular, we may ignore any t dependence of n,

and therefore of p in our analysis. the metal will melt at temperatures much lower

than that. the classical limit is reached way below such temperatures.

appendix c : path integral calculation of the casimir eect due to

masless scalar eld in the parallel plates geometry

in this appendix we evaluate the casimir energy due to massless scalar eld in

the parallel plate geometry using the path integral formalism of section 3 (following

in part [4, 6]) and analyze the classical limit. we also discuss briey deviations from

perfect conductor behavior.

as in the text, we take the plates to lie at the planes z = 0, d. thus, the surface

coordinates are u() = (x, y, ),

( = 1, 2). according to (61) and (58) the casimir

energy is given by7

perhaps more transparent than the exponential regulator (7) in section 1.

(c.8)

(c.9)

note that for any value of lpd, the denominator in (c.9) has a simple zero u = 0

(and no additional zeros), and is moreover manifestly positive for all u > 0. thus,

the force (c.9) is attractive.

the perfect conductor limit corresponds to pd  . in this limit (c.9) tends to

(c.10)

this is only half the electromagnetic casimir force (10), since here we are studying a

real massles scalar eld.

slightly imperfect conductors can be treated by taking pd in (c.9) large but

nite. by expanding (c.9) in inverse powers of lpd, we can calculate corrections to

38

(c.10) due to deviations from perfect conductor behavior [27]8 [28, 44].9 for example,

the leading such correction to (c.10) is

lpd!



z0

u4eu du

(eu  1)2 =

2

60d4   1

lpd! .

(c.11)

this correction is manifestly positive and thus acts to reduce (c.10), which makes

sense physically. this expression, unlike (c.10), depends on the unknown parameter
l, of o(1). having this parameter in what is in principle a measurable quantity, is
the price we have to pay for treating the the thickened boundary b, at large p,
approximately as a skin layer of width l/p in section 3 (see the discussion in

the rst paragraph of section 3.1.2 and also the paragraph following (54)). as a

consistency check, we compare (c.11) to an analysis of the same problem (for the

electromagnetic eld) in section 3 of [28]. the latter calculation is based on analysis

of electromagnetic greens functions, and does not make a skin layer approximation.

we see that (c.11) is of the same form of the leading correction in eq. (3.22) of [28],
and equals one half of that correction provided l = 3/2, which is indeed of o(1).

obviously, we cannot use (c.9) to study grossly imperfect conductors, nor can we

use it to study the behavior of the casimir force at small plate separations d that fall

outside the range (45), since we derived (c.9) within the skin layer approximation.

in order to address these issues we will have to take the width of the plates and

the three dimensional plasma of electrons that live in them (as well as perhaps

additional dispersive eects [45]) into account, but we will not carry this analysis

here.

we now turn to nite temperature analysis and the classical limit. according to

(66) and (64) the casimir free energy is given by

fc =

(c.12)

8there is a slight numerical error in the leading correction given by [27].
9this expansion is well behaved, since in eect, the integrand is expanded in powers of
(u/pd)eu/(eu  1) and of (u/pd)2eu/(eu  1), which do not introduce poles at u = 0, and due to
the extra factor of 1/(eu  1) are also well behaved for large u.

we now consider the classical limit. at temperatures t such that 2d1 > 1,

exponentially small corrections from the other terms). thus, in the classical limit we
indeed obtain an asymptotic behavior of (fcf self
