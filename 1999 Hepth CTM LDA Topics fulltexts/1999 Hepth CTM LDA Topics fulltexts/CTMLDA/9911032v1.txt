abstract

we compare the way one of us got spinors out of elds, which are a priori

antisymmetric tensor elds, to the dirac-kahler rewriting. since using our

grassmann formulation is simple it may be useful in describing the dirac-

kahler formulation of spinors and in generalizing it to vector internal degrees

of freedom and to charges. the cheat concerning the lorentz transforma-

tions for spinors is the same in both cases and is put clearly forward in the

grassmann formulation. also the generalizations are clearly pointed out. the

discrete symmetries are discussed, in particular the appearance of two kinds

of the time-reversal operators as well as the unavoidability of four families.

i. introduction

kahler [1] has shown how to pack the dirac wave function into the language of dierential

forms in the sense that the dirac equation is an equation in which a linear operator acts

on a linear combination u of p-forms ( p=0, 1, ...,d; here d=dimension =4). this is the

dirac-kahler formalism.

one of us [2] has long developed an a priori rather dierent formalism in an attempt to

unify spin and charges. in this approach the spin degrees of freedom come out of canonically

quantizing certain grassmannian odd ( position analogue in the sense of being on an analogue

footing with xa) variables a. these variables are denoted by a vector index a, and there

are at rst to see no spinors at all!

one of the main purposes of the present article is to point out the analogy and nice

relations between the two dierent ways of achieving the - almost miraculous - appearance

of spin one half degrees of freedom in spite of starting from pure vectors and tensors.

of course it is a priori impossible that vectorial and tensorial elds ( or degrees of

freedom) can be converted into spinorial ones without some cheat. the cheat consists

really in exchanging one set of lorentz transformation generators by another set ( which

indeed means putting strongly to zero one type of grassmann odd operators fullling the

cliord algebra and anticommuting with another type of grassmann odd operators, which

also fulll the cliord algebra [2] ).

in fact one nds on page 512 in the kahlers [1] article that there are two sets of rotation

generators; one set for which the u eld (in the kahlers notation) transforms as a spinor

eld and another one for which it transforms as superpositions of vector and (antisymmetric

) tensor elds. analogously in the approach of one of us the apriori lorentz transformation
generators sab = sab + sab have the wave function transform as vectors and antisymmetric

tensors, while sab ( = i 1

4 [aa, ab] and [, ] means the commutator )
used alone are also possible lorentz generators for which now the wave function transforms

4 [aa, ab] ) or sab ( = i 1

as a spinor wave function. by putting aa ( which has the property that [ sab, ac] = 0 ) equal

2

strongly to zero is the same as replacing sab by sab.

in both approaches to get spinors out of vectors and antisymmetric tensors, as start, you

get not only one but several copies, families, of dirac elds. this is a fundamental feature

in as far as these dierent families are connected by the generator parts not used: if one
for instance uses sab as the lorentz generator to get spinors, then the not used part sab

transforms the families ( of the same grassmann character ) into each other.

it will be a major content of the present article to bring about a dictionary relating the

two formalisms so that one can enjoy the simplicity of one also working on the other one. we

also shall generalize the kahler operators for d = 4, comment on the discrete symmetries,

which in the one of us approach show up clearly and use the d  4 dimensions to describe

spins and charges [2].

in the following section we shall put forward the little part of the formalism of the work

of one of us needed for the comparison with the dirac-kahler formalism.

in the next section again - section 3 - we shall then tell the (usual) dirac-kahler formalism

as far as relevant.

the comparison which should now be rather obvious is performed in section 4.

in section 5 we shall analyse in the two approaches in parallel how the remarkable nding

of the dirac equation inside a purely tensorial-vectorial system of elds occurs.

in section 6 we shall comment on the evenness of the a matrices, which have to transform

grassmann odd wave functions into grassmann odd wave functions.

in section 7 we shall comment on discrete symmetries for either kahler or the one of us

approach, also discussing the realization of the discrete symmetries pointed up clearly by

weinberg in his book [8] on pages 100-105.

in section 8 we want to investigate how unavoidable the appearance of families is to this

type of approaches.

in section 9 we shall look at how the ideas of one of us of extra dimensions generalizes

the kahler approach.

3

in section 10 we discuss the nielsen and ninomija [5] no go theorem for spinors on a

lattice and a possible way out.

in section 11 we shall resume and deliver concluding remarks.

ii. dirac equations in grassmann space

what we can call the mankoc approach [2], and which is the work of one of us, is a

rather ambitious model for going beyond the standard model with say 10 ( or more) extra

dimensions, but what we need for the present connection with the dirac-kahler [1] formalism

is only the way in which the spin part of the dirac particle elds comes about. the total

number of dimensions in the model is ( most hopefully ) 13 +1 bosonic degrees of freedom,

i.e. normal dimensions, and the same number of fermionic ones.

let us call the dimension of space-time d and then the dirac spinor degrees of freedom

shall come from the odd grassmannian variables a,

a  {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, , d}.

in wanting to quantize or just to make poisson brackets out of the d as we have two

choices since we could either decide to make the dierent as their own conjugate, so that

one only has d/2 degrees of freedom - this is the approach of ravndal and divecchia [3] -

or we could decide to consider the as conguration space variables only. in the latter case

- which is the mankoc case - we have then from the as dierent conjugate variables pa.

in this latter case we are entitled to write wave functions of the form

(a) = xi=0,1,..,3,5,..,d

x

{a1<a2<...<ai}{0,1,..,3,5,..,d}

a1,a2,...,aia1a2    ai.

(1)

this is the only form a function of the odd grassmannian variables a can take. thus

the wave function space here has dimension 2d. completely analogously to usual quantum

mechanics we have the operator for the conjugate variable a to be

p
a := i



a := i


 a.

(2)

the right arrow here just tells, that the derivation has to be performed from the left hand

4

side. these operators then obey the odd heisenberg algebra, which written by means of the

generalized commutators

{a, b} := ab  (1)nab ba

where

nab =




takes the form

+1,

if a and b have grassmann odd character

0,

otherwise

{pa, pb} = 0 = {a, b},

{pa, b} = iab.

here ab is the at metric  = diag{1, 1, 1, ...}.

for later use we shall dene the operators

aa := i(pa  ia),

aa := (pa + ia),

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

for which we can show that the aas among themselves fulll the cliord algebra as do also

the aas, while they mutually anticommute:

{aa, ab} = 2ab = {aa, ab},

{aa, ab} = 0.

(7)

note that the linear combinations (6) presuppose a metric tensor, since otherwise only a

and p

a but not a and p a are dened.

we could recognize formally

either

aapa| >= 0,

or

aapa| >= 0

(8)

as the dirac-like equation, because of the above generalized commutation relations. applying

either the operator aapa or aapa on the two equations (eqs.(8)) we get the klein-gordon

equation papa| >= 0. here of course we dened

pa = i


xa .

5

(9)

however, it is rather obvious that these equations (8) are not dirac equations in the sense

of the wave function transforming as a spinor, w.r.t.

to the generators for the lorentz

transformations, if taken as usual

sab := apb  bpa.

however it is easily seen that we can write these generators as the sum

sab = sab + sab,

where we have dened

sab := 

i
4

[aa, ab],

sab := 

[aa, ab],

i
4

(10)

(11)

(12)

with [a, b] := ab  ba. one can now easily see that the solutions of the two equations
(8) now transform as spinors with respect to either sab or sab.

it is of great importance for the trick of manipulating what we shall consider to be

the lorentz transformations and thus to be able to make the miraculous  shifts of lorentz

representation that is the somewhat remarkable characteristic of the kahler type of shift in

formulation interpretation, that both - untilded, the single tilded and the double tilded -

sab obey the d-dimensional lorentz generator algebra {m ab, m cd} = i(m adbc + m bcad 

m acbd  m bdac), when inserted for m ab.

really the cheat consist -as we shall return to - in replacing the lorentz generators by

the sab, say. this cheat means indeed that for this choice the operators aa have to be put

strongly to zero in the generators of the lorentz transformations (eq.(10, 11, 12)) as well

as in all the other operators, representing the physical quantities.

we shall present the one of us approach in further details in section 4 pointing out the

similarities between this approach and the kahler approach and generalizing the kahler

approach.

6

iii. k ahler formulation of spinors

the kahler formulation [1] takes its starting point by considering p-forms in the d-

dimensional space, d = 4. elegantly, the 1-forms say are dened as dual vectors to the

(local) tangent spaces, and the higher p-forms can then be dened as antisymmetrized

cartesian (exterior) products of the one-form spaces, and the 0-forms are the scalars; but we

can perhaps more concretely think about the p-forms as formal linear combinations of the

dierentials of the coordinates dxa : a general linear combination of forms is then written

u = u0 + u1 + ... + ud

(13)

where the p-form is of the form

up =

1

p! xi1,i2,...,ip

ai1i2...ip  dxi1  dxi2  dxi3      dxip =

xi1<i2...<ip

ai1i2...ip  dxi1  dxi2  dxi3      dxip.

(14)

then one can dene both the presumably most well known exterior algebra denoted by

the exterior product  and the cliord product  among the forms. the wedge product

 has the property of making the product of a p-form and a q-form be a (p+q)-form, if a

p-form and a q-form have no common dierentials. the cliord product dxa on a p-form

is either a p + 1 form, if a p-form does not include a one form dxa, or a p  1 form, if a one

form dxa is included in a p-form.

actually kahler found how the dirac equation could be written as an equation [1] ( eq.

(26.6) in the kahlers paper)

 iu = (m + e  )  u

(15)

where the symbol u stands for a linear combination of p-forms (eq.(13)) and p 

{0, 1, .., 3, 5, .., d} with d being the dimension of space-time, namely d = 4 for the kahlers

7

case. further in the notation of kahler the symbol1  denotes inner dierentiation, which

means the analogue of the exterior dierential d but with the use of the cliord product 

instead of the exterior product 

u =

3

xi=1

dxi 

u
xi  dt 

u
t

= du +

3

xi=1

ei

u
xi  ei

u
t

.

(16)

the symbol e   determines the coupling of the charge with the electromagnetic eld  =

aadxa,

a  {0, 1, 2, 3} and m means the electron mass, the symbol ei transforms a p-form

into (p  1)-form, if the p-form includes dxi, otherwise it gives zero.

for a free massless particle living in a d dimensional space-time - this is what interests

us in this paper since the mass term brings no new feature in the theory - eq.(15) can be

rewritten in the form

dxa  pa u = 0,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., d

(17)

where the symbol u stands again for a linear combination of p-forms ( p = 0,1,2,3,5,...,d).

that is to say that the wave function describing the state of the spin one half particle is

packed into the exterior algebra function u.

more about the kahlers approach will come in section 4 giving the correspondence

between that and the one with the grassmann as, where we shall also give some general-

izations.

iv. parallelism between the two approaches

we demonstrate the parallelism between the kahler [1] and the one of us [2] approach

in steps, paying attention on the becher-joos [4] paper as well. first we shall treat the

1the notation in the becher and joos [4] paper is slightly dierent from the kahler notation. the

becher and joos paper uses d = dxa 

xa , as kahler does in his paper, but  of kahler is in the

becher and joos paper replaced by d  , which means that in their paper  = ea 

xa .

8

spin 1

2 elds only, as kahler did. we shall use the simple and transparent denition of

the exterior and interior product in grassmann space to generalize the kahler approach to

two kinds of  (eq.(16)) operators on the space of p-forms and then accordingly to three

kinds of the generators of the lorentz transformations, two of the spinorial and one of the

vectorial character, the rst kind transforming spinor 1

2 elds, the second one transforming

the vector elds. we comment on the hodge star product for both approaches, dene the

scalar product of vectors in the vector space of either p-forms or of polynomials of as

and comment on four replications of the weyl bi-spinor. we also discuss briey the vector

representations in both approaches.

a. dirac-kahler equation and dirac equation in grassmann space for massless

particles

we present here, side by side, the operators in the space of dierential forms and in the

space of polynomials of as. we present the exterior product

dxa  dxb     ,

a b    ,

the operator of dierentiation

 iea,

pa = i


a = i




a

(18)

(19)

and the two superpositions of the above operators

dxa  := dxa  + ea,

aa := i(pa  ia),

dxa  := i(dxa   ea),

aa := (pa + ia).

(20)

here  stays instead of  of eq.(15), used by kahler.

introducing the notation with 

and  we not only point out the similarities between the two approaches but also the two
possibilities for the cliord product - only one of them used by kahler. both  and  are

cliord products on p-forms, while aa aa are the corresponding linear operators operating

9

on the space of polynomials of as. one easily nds the commutation relations, if for both

approaches the generalized form of commutators, presented in eq.(4), are understood

{dxa , dxb } = 2ab,

{aa, ab} = 2ab

{dxa , dxb } = 2ab,

{aa, ab} = 2ab.

(21)

here ab is the metric of space-time.

the vacuum state | > is dened as

dxa  | >= dxa,

aa | >= a,

dxa  | >= dxa,

aa | >= a.

now we can dene the dirac-like equations for both approaches:

dxa  pa u = 0,

aa pa (a) = 0,

dxa  pa u = 0,

aa pa (a) = 0.

(22)

(23)

since {ea, dxb } = ab and {ea, eb} = 0 = {dxa , dxb } = 0, while {ipa, b} = ab

and {ipa, ipb} = 0 = {a, b}, it is obvious that ea plays in the p-form formalism the role

of the derivative with respect to a dierential 1form, similarly as ipa does with respect to

a grassmann coordinate.

taking into account the above denitions, one easily nds that

dxa  pa dxb  pb u = pa pa u = 0,

aa pa ab pb (b) = pa pa (b) = 0.

dxa  pa dxb  pb u = pa pa u = 0,

b
aa pa a

pb (b) = pa pa (b) = 0.

(24)

both vectors, the u, which are the superpositions of dierential p-forms and the (a),

which are polynomials in as are dened in a similar way (eqs.(1 ,14)), as we shall point

out in the following subsection.

we see that either dxa  pa = 0 or dxa  pa = 0, similarly as either aa pa = 0 or

aa pa = 0 can represent the dirac-like equation.

10

b. vector space of two approaches

the superpositions of p-forms on which the dirac-kahler equation is dened and the

superpositions of polynomials in grassmann space, on which the dirac-like equations are

dened, are

u= xi=0,1,2,3,5,..,d

x

a1<a2<...<ai{0,1,2,3,5,..,d}

aa1a2...ap  dxa1  dxa2  dxa3      dxai,

(a)= xi=0,d

x

a1<a2<...<ai{0,1,2,3,5,...,d}

a1a2...ai  a1a2    ai.

(25)

the coecients a1,a2,..,ai depend on coordinates xa in both cases and are antisymmetric

tensors of the rank i with respect to indices ak  {a1, .., ai}. the vector space is in both

cases 16 dimensional.

c. dirac a -like operators

both, dxa  and dxa  dene the algebra of the a matrices and so they do both aa and

aa. one would thus be tempted to identify

a
naive := dxa ,

or

a
naive := aa.

(26)

but there is a large freedom in dening what to identify with the gamma-matrices,

because except when using 0 as a parity operation you have an even number of gamma

matrices occurring in the physical applications. then you may multiply all the gamma

matrices by some factor provided it does not disturb their algebra nor their even products.

we shall comment this point in section 6.

1. problem of statistics of gamma-matrices

this freedom might be used to solve, what seems a problem:

having an odd grassmann character, neither aa nor aa should be recognized as the dirac

a operators, since they would change, when operating on polynomials of a, polynomials of

11

an odd grassmann character to polynomials of an even grassmann character. one would,

however, expect - since grassmann odd elds second quantize to fermions, while grassmann

even elds second quantize to bosons - that the a operators do not change the grassmann

character of wave functions. one can notice, that similarly to the grassmann case, also the

two types of the cliord products dened on p-forms, change the oddness or the evenness of
the p-forms: an even p-form, p = 2n, is changed by either dxa  or dxa  to an odd q-form,

with either q = p + 1, if dxa is not included in a p-form, or q = p  1, if dxa is included in a

p-form, while an odd p-form, p = 2n + 1, is changed to an even p + 1-form or p  1-form.

2. first solution to gamma-matrix statistics problem

we shall later therefore propose that accordingly

either

a := i dx0  dxa ,

or

a = i a0 aa

(27)

are recognized as the dirac a operators operating on the space of p-forms or polynomials

of as, respectively, since they both have an even grassmann character and they both fulll

the cliord algebra

{a, b} = 2ab.

(28)

of course, the role of () and () can in either the kahler case or the case of polynomials

in grassmann space, be exchanged.

whether we dene the gamma-matrices by (27) or (26) makes only a dierence for an

odd products of gamma-matrices, but for applications such as construction of currents a

or for the lorentz generators on the spinors i 1

4 [a, b] only products of even numbers of

gamma-matrices occur, except for the parity representation on the dirac elds, where the

0-matrix is used alone. this 0-matrix has to simulate the parity reection which is either

~dx   ~dx,

or ~  ~.

(29)

12

the ugly gamma-matrix identications (27) indeed perform this operation. and as long

as the physical applications are the ones just mentioned - and that should be sucient - the

choice (27) is satisfactory: living in the grassmann odd part of the hilbert space, we dont

move into the grassmann even part of it.

the canonical quantization of grassmann odd elds, that is the procedure with the

hamiltonian and the poisson brackets, then automatically assures the anticommuting rela-

tions between the operators of the fermionic elds.

3. solution by redenition of oddness

the simplest solution to the problem with the evenness and oddness is to use the naive

gamma-matrix identications (26) and simply ignore that the even-odd-ness does not match.

this is what kahler did, we can say, in as far as he did not really identify the even-odd-ness

of the p-forms with the statistics of dirac elds.

if one - along the lines of the bechers

and jooss paper ( [4]) - will make a second quantized theory based on the kahler trick one

does not proceed by insisting on taking p-forms to be fermionic only when p is odd. becher

and joos take all the forms as fermion elds and assume then anticommuting relations for

operators of elds. this simplest solution can thus be claimed to be the one applied by kahler

and used by becher and joos: they simply do not dream about in advance postulating that

the p-forms should necessarily be taken to be boson or fermion elds depending on whether

p is even or odd.

it is only when one as one of us in her model has the requirement of canonical quantization

saying that the as should be grassmann odd objects, which indeed they are, that the

problem occurs.

d. generators of lorentz transformations

again, we are presenting the generators of the lorentz transformations of spinors for

both approaches

13

m ab = lab + sab,

lab = xapb  xbpa,

(30)

diering among themselves in the denition of sab only, which dene the generators of the

lorentz transformations in the internal space, that is in the space of p-forms or polynomials

of as, respectively. while kahler suggested the denition

sab = dxa  dxb, sabu =

1
2

((dxa  dxb)  u  u  (dxa  dxb)),

(31)

in the grassmann case [2] the operator sab is one of the two generators dened above ( eq.

(12)), that is

either sab = sab = 

i
4

[aa, ab] = 

i
4

[a, b],

or

sab = sab = 

[aa, ab].

(32)

i
4

one further nds

[ sab, ac] = i(acab  bcaa),

[sab, ac] = i(acab  bcaa), while

[ sab, ac] = 0 = [sab, ac].

(33)

one can also in the kahler case dene two kinds of the lorentz generators, which operate

on the internal space of p-forms, according to two kinds of the cliord products, presented

above. following the denitions in the one of us [2] approach, one can write the sab for the

kahler case

either sab = 

i
4

[dxa  + ea, dxb  + eb] = 

i
4

[a, b],

or

s ab =

i
4

[dxa   ea, dxb   eb].

(34)

not only are in this case the similarities between the two approaches more transparent,

also the denition of the generators of the lorentz transformations in the space of p-forms

simplies very much.

one further nds for the spinorial case

[m ab, a pa] = 0,

for m ab = lab + sab,

(35)

14

which demonstrates that the total angular momentum for a free massless particle is con-

served. the above equation is true for both approaches and the generators of the lorentz

transformations m ab fulll the lorentz algebra in both cases.

in addition, the operators of the lorentz transformations with the vectorial character

can also be dened for both approaches in an equivalent way, that is as a sum of the two

operators of the spinorial character

sab = sab + sab = i(dxa  eb  dxb  ea),

sab = sab + sab = apb  bpa,

(36)

which again fulll the lorentz algebra. the operator sab = i(dxa  eb  dxb  ea), if

being applied on dierential p-forms, transforms vectors into vectors, correspondingly sab =

apb  bpa, if being applied to polynomial of as transforms vectors into vectors [2].

elements of the lorentz group can be written for both approaches, for either spinorial

or vectorial kind of the generators as

u = eabm ab

,

(37)

where ab are parameters of the group. if m ab are equal to either lab + sab or lab + sab, the

period of transformations is 4 either in the space of dierential forms or in the grassmann

space, demonstrating the spinorial character of the operator. if m ab is the sum of lab and
sab + sab, the period of transformation is 2, manifesting the vectorial character of the

operator.

e. hodge star product

in the way how we have dened the operators in the space of p-form, the denition of

the hodge star operator, dened by kahler working in the space of p-forms and the space

of a polynomials, will be respectively

 = i ya=0,1,2,3,5,..,d

a,

15

(38)

with a equal to either dx0  dxa  in the kahler case, or to i a0 aa in the one of us [2]

approach. for an even d the factor with double tilde (  ) can be in both cases omitted (
 = either i qa aa or i qa dxa  , again we could distinguish the operators  and  in

both cases, according to the elements, which dene the casimir ). it follows that

(1  )

1
2

(39)

are the two operators, which when being applied on wave functions dened either on p-forms

or on polynomials in grassmann space, project out the left or right handed component,

respectively.

one easily recognizes that when being applied on a vacuum state | >, the operator 

behaves as a hodge star product, since one nds for d even

 i | >= dx0  dx1  ....  dxd,

i | >= 01...d.

(40)

f. scalar product

in the mankocs approach [2] the scalar product between the two functions (1)(a) and

(2)(a) is dened as follows

< (1)|(2) >= z dd ( (1)(a)) (2)(a).

here  is the weight function

 = yi=0,1,2,3,5,..,d

(i +


i )

which operates on the rst function, (1), only while

(41)

(42)

z da = 0,

z daa = 1,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, .., d,

(43)

no summation over repeated index is meant and

z dd 01235...d = 1,

dd = dd...d5d3d2d1d0.

(44)

16

since a = a,  means the complex conjugation and + means the hermitian conjugation,
then with respect to the above dened scalar product the operator a+ = aa

aaa, while aa+ = aaaa and aa+ = aaaa. again no summation over repeated index is




=

a+

a

,

performed. accordingly the operators of the lorentz transformations of spinorial character

are self-adjoint (if a 6= 0 and b 6= 0) or anti-self-adjoint ( if a = 0 or b = 0 ).

according to eqs.(41, 25) the scalar product of two functions (1)(a) and (2)(a) )

can be written as follows

< (1)|(2) > = x0,d

x1<2<..<i

(1)

12..i

 (2)

12..i

(45)

in complete analogy with the usual denition of scalar products in ordinary space. kahler [1]

dened in eq. (15.11) and on page 519 the scalar product of two superpositions of p-forms

u(1) and u(2) as follows

< u(1)|u(2) > = x0,d

x1<2<..<i

12..i,

(46)

which ( for real coecients (k)

12..i , k = 1, 2 ) agrees with eq.(45).

g. four families of solutions in kahler or in approach in grassmann space

we shall limit ourselves in d = 4 and in spinorial case ( as indeed kahler did). the

representations for higher d, analyzed with respect to the groups so(1, 3)su(3)su(2)

u(1), and some other groups, in grassmann space are ( only for grassmann even part of

the space belonging to the groups which does not include so(1, 3)) presented in ref. [2].

in the case of d = 4 one may arrange the space of 2d vectors into four times two weyl

spinors, one left ( < (4) >= 1) and one right ( < (4) >= 1) handed. we are presenting

this vectors, which are at the same time the eigenvectors of s12 and s03, as polynomials of

ms, m  (0, 1, 2, 3). the two weyl vectors are connected by the operation of m operators

(eq.(27)).

taking into account that aa| >= a, where | > is the vacuum state (eq.(22)), we nd

table i.-irreducible representations of the two subgroups su(2)  su(2) of the group

so(1, 3) as dened by the generators of the spinorial character s12, s03 and the opera-

tor of handedness (4). the four copies of the weyl bispinors have either an odd or an even
grassmann character. the generators smn, m, n  (0, 1, 2, 3), transform the two copies of

the same grassmann character one into another.

similarly also the kahler spinors can be arranged into four copies. we nd them by only

replacing in table i. aa by dxa . we shall discuss this point also in the next section.

analysing the irreducible representations of the group so(1, 3) in analogy with the spinor

case but taking into account the generator of the lorentz transformations of the vector type

(eqs.(10, 36)) one nds [2] for d = 4 two scalars ( a scalar and a pseudo scalar), two

three vectors (in the su(2)  su(2) representation of so(1, 3) usually denoted by (1, 0)

and (0, 1) representation, respectively, with < (4) > equal to 1 ) and two four vectors

( in the su(2)  su(2) representation of so(1, 3) both denoted by ( 1

among themselves in the grassmann character ) all of which are eigenvectors of s(4)2 =

the same kind of representations also in the kahler case.

both, in the spinor case and in the vector case one has 24 dimensional vector space.

v. appearance of spinors

one may quite strongly wonder about how it is at all possible that there appear the

dirac equation - usually being an equation for a spinor eld - out of models with only

scalar, vector and tensor objects!

immediately one would say that it is of course sheer

impossible to construct spinors such as dirac elds out of the integer spin objects such

as the dierential one forms and their external products or of the as and their products

ab    c.

let us say immediately that it also only can be done by a cheat. this cheat really

consists in replacing the lorentz transformation concept ( including rotation concept) by
exchanging the lorentz generators sab by the sab say ( or the sab if we choose them instead),

see equations (32, 34). this indeed means that one of the two kinds of operators fullling the
cliord algebra and anticommuting with the other kind - it has been made a choice of dxa 

in the kahler case and aa in the approach of one of us - are put to zero in the operators of

19

lorentz transformations; as well as in all the operators representing the physical quantities.
the use of dx0  or a0

in the operator 0 is the exception only used to simulate the

a
grassmann even parity operation ~dx

a
  ~dx

and ~  ~, respectively.

the assumption, which we call cheat was made in the kahler approach [1] and in its

lattice version [4], as well as in the approach of one of us [2].

in ref. [2] the aas are argued away on the ground that with a certain single particle

action

i = z d d l(x, , , ),

(47)

(with xa being ordinary coordinates, a grassmann coordinates, a  {0, 1, .., d},  an ordi-

nary time parameter and  an anticommuting time parameter and assuming x a = xa + a

and making a choice for ) with which we shall not go in details here, the aa appear to be zero

a
as one of the constraints. this constraint has been used to put a
calculations in this reference and it was used as argument for dropping the s
-part of the
lorentz generator sab. 2 let us stress that once the aa or dxa  is dropped and accordingly
the sab is dropped - for whatever reason - one is no longer asking for the representation

s equal zero in the further

ab

under the same lorentz transformations ( including rotations ) and one shall not expect to

nd say integer spin even if the eld considered is purely constructed from scalars, vectors

and tensors !

let us point out further that what happens is that as well the a polynomials of one of

us as the linear combinations of p-forms in the kahler approach can be formulated as double

spinors, i.e. expressions with two (dirac) spinor indices,  and  say, and that the cheat

consists in dropping from the concept of lorentz transformations the transformations in one

of these indices. in fact we can rewrite:

2 we point out in ref.( [2]) that this constraint, when once being taken into account by putting it

zero in all the physical operators, was not further treated as a weak equation. furthermore such a

weak equation - aa is an odd grassmann operator - can not at all be fullled.

20

for the even d case one has

either ({a}) :=

d

xi=0

(a1a2    ai) a1a2    ai,

or ({dxa}) :=

d

xi=0

while for the odd d case one has:

(a1a2    ai)dxa1  dxa2     dxai,

(48)

either ({a}) :=

d

xi=0

(()a1()a2    ()ai) a1a2    ai,

or ({a}) :=

d

xi=0

(()a1()a2    ()ai) dxa1  dxa2     dxai ,

(49)

with the convention a1 < a2 < a3 < ... < ai. here the sums run over the number i of factors

in the products of dxa or a coordinates, a number, which is the same as the number

of gamma-matrix factors and it should be remarked that we include the possibility i = 0

which means no factors and is taken to mean that the product of zero dxa or a-factors

is unity and the product of zero gamma matrices is the unit matrix. the indices ,  are

the spinor indices and taking the product of gamma-matrices conceived of as matrices the

symbol (...) stands for an element in the -th row and in the -th column. there is an

understood einstein convention summation over the contracted vector indices ak, k=1,2,...,i.

the gamma-matrices are in the even dimension case 2d/2 by 2d/2 matrices and in the odd

dimension case 2(d1)/2 by 2(d1)/2 matrices.

in the odd case we have worked with two

(slightly) dierent gamma-matrix choices - and thus have written the gamma-matrices as

depending on the sign  as ()ak - namely gamma matrix choices obeying

 = 12    d.

(50)

the a matrices should be constructed of course so that they obey the cliord algebra

{a, b} = 2ab

the minkowski metric 1  i1 has to be taken, if the index 1 is recognized as the time

a. ( see e.g. ( [7])). the above metric is supposed to be euclidean. for

a

index. we shall make use of the minkowski metric, counting the a from 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..d, and

assuming the metric ab = diag(1, 1, 1, ..., 1).

in this notation we can see that for xed values of the index  we obtain one of the four

bispinors in table i. conceived of as a spinor in the index  and with the understanding

that the aa in the table lead to the corresponding a, when acting on the vacuum state. the

equivalent table for the kahler approach follows by replacing a by dxa.

it is our main point to show that the action by the operators dxa or aa and  or aa in

the representation based on the basis ({dxa}) or ({a}) with ,   {1, 2, ..., },

transforms the index  and ,

respectively, of the basis

({dxa}) or equivalently ({a}) as follows:




2(d1)/2

2d/2

for d even




either dxa  ()({dxa})  a

 ()({dxa}),

corresponding to

aa ()({a})  a

 ()({a}),

22

or dxa  ()({dxa})  ()({dxa}) a

,

corresponding to

a

a

()({a})  ()({a}) a

,

(52)

which demonstrates the similarities between the spinors of the one of us approach and

the kahler approach: the operators dxa  and aa transform the left index of the basis

()({dxa}), or correspondingly of the basis ()({a}), while keeping the right index
xed and the operators dxa  and a

transform the right index of the basis ()({dxa}),

a

or correspondingly of the basis ()({a}) and keep the left index xed. under the action
of either dxa  and aa or dxa  and a

the basic functions transform as spinors. the index

a

in parentheses () is dened for only odd d. we can count that the number of spinors is 2d

either in the mankocs approach or in the kahlers approach; the d dimensional grassmann

space or the space of p-forms has 2d basic functions.

we shall prove the above formulas for action of the aa and a

a

. the proof is also valid

for the kahler case if aa is replaced by dxa  and a

a

by dxa .

a
a. proof of our formula for action of aa and a

let us rst introduce the notation

a := ab    c,

a := cb    a,

(53)

with a < b <    < c  a. we recognize that

trace (ab) = trace(i) a

b, xa

(a)(a) = trace(i)  

(54)

and

xi

(ai)(cai) = trace(i) (c), xi

(ai)(ai(1)ic) = trace(i) (c).

(55)

using the rst equation we nd

23

a =

1

trace(i)

(a) ()({a}).

(56)

the index () has the meaning for only an odd d. that is why we put it in parenthesis. we

may accordingly write

()({a}) := xi=0

1

trace(i)

(ai)(ai)()({a}),

(57)

with a1 < a2,    , < ai  ai in ascending order and with ai in descending order.

then we nd, taking into account that aa| >= a, aa| >= ia, where | > is a vacuum

state and eq.(7)

ac ()({a}) := xi

(ai)acai = xi

(ai)acaai| >=

1

trace(i)

xi

(ai)(cai)()({a}).

using the above relations we further nd

ac ()({a}) := (1) f (d,c)(c)()({a}),

(58)

where (1) f (d,c) is 1, which depends on the operator ac and the dimension of the space.

we nd in a similar way

c
a

()({a}) := xi

c
(ai)a

aai| > = xi

(1)i(ai)aaia

c

| > =

xi

(1)i(ai)aaiac| > = xi

(1)i

trace(i)

(ai)(aic) ()({a}),

which nally gives

c
a

()({a}) := (1)

f (d,c)()({a})(c),

(59)

with the signum (1)

f (d,c) depending on the dimension of the space and the operator a

c

.

we have therefore proven the two equations which determine the action of the operators

a
aa and a

on the basic function ()({a}).

24

vi. getting an even gamma matrix

according to the eqs.(58, 59) it is obvious that the a matrices, entering into the

dirac-kahler approach or one of us approach for spinors, have an odd grassmann

character since both, dxa  and aa as well as dxa  and a

a

, have an odd grassmann

character. they therefore transform a grassmann odd basic function into a grassmann even

basic function changing fermion elds into boson elds. it is clear that such a matrices are

not appropriate to enter into the equations of motion and lagrangeans for spinors.

there are several possibilities to avoid this trouble [2]. one of them was presented in
if working with dxa  or aa alone, putting dxa  or aa in the hamiltonian,

section 4.

lagrangean and all the operators equal to zero, the a matrices of an even grassmann
character can be dened as proposed in eq.(27) a := idx0  dxa  or a := ia

aa, which

0

fulll the cliord algebra {a, b} = 2ab, while as we already have said sab =  i

4[a, b].

we then have

a()({}) = a

()({a})0

.

(60)

one can check that a have all the properties of the dirac a matrices.

(exchanging dxa  or aa by dxa  or aa, respectively, the gamma-matrices dened as
:= either i dx0  dxa  or i a0a

have again all the properties of the dirac a matrices.)

vii. discrete symmetries

we shall comment in this section the discrete symmetries of spinors and vectors in the

hilbert space spanned over either the grassmann coordinate space or the space of dierential

forms from the point of view of the one particle states of massless dirac (that is the weyl)

particles.

in oder to dene the discrete symmetries of the lorentz group we introduce the space

inversion p and the time inversion t operator in ordinary space-time in the usual way. we

shall assume the case d = 4.

25

p xap 1 = xa,

t xat 1 = xa

(61)

with the metric ab, xa = abxb already dened in section 2. since one wants the time reversal

operator to leave p0, that is the zero component of the ordinary space-time momentum

operator (pa), unchanged (p0  p0), while the space component ~p should change sign (~p 

~p), one also requires

t it 1 = i,

leading

to t pat 1 = pa.

(62)

we rst shall treat spinors. having the representation of spinors expressed in terms of

polynomials of as in table i., which also represents the corresponding superpositions of

p-forms if a is accordingly substituted by dxa, we expect each of the four copies of dirac

massless spinors to transform under discrete symmetries of the lorentz transformations in

an usual way.

the parity operator p should transform left handed spinors with < (4) >= 1 to right

handed spinors with < (4) >= 1, without changing the spin of the spinors. this is what

0 (eq.(27)) does for any of four copies of the dirac massless spinors, which are the weyl

bispinors of table i., separately.

the time reversal operator t should transform left handed spinors with < (4) >= 1

and spin 1

2 to left handed spinors with < (4) >= 1 and spin  1

2 , what the operator

t = iint  xk,

int = 1 3,

x = diag(1, 1, 1, 1),

and kik 1 = i

(63)

does when applied to any of four copies of the dirac spinors of table i. this transformation

involves only members of the same copy of the dirac bispinor. the operators a which are

dened in eq.(27), have due to the appropriate choice of phases of the spinors of table i,

the usual chiral matrix representation ( for both approaches - the kahler and the one of us).

one would, however, expect that the time and the space reversal operators should work

in both spaces - that is in the ordinary space-time and in the space of either grassmann

polynomials or in the space of p-forms - in an equivalent way

26

p xap 1 = xa,

t xat 1 = xa,

p ap 1 = a,

or correspondingly p dxa  p 1 = dxa,

and t at 1 = a,

or correspondingly t dxa  t 1 = dxa,

t it 1 = i,

leading to t pat 1 = pa

(64)

and changing equivalently the momenta conjugate to coordinates in either the one of us or

the kahler approach.

applying the transformation p of eq.(64) on any of four copies of the dirac bispinors of

table i., one obtains the same result as in the above, that is the standard denition of the

space-reversal operation. applying the transformation t of eq.(64) on, let us say, the rst

spinor of the rst copy of the dirac bispinors of table i. ( that is on 1()1), one obtains

the last spinor of the last copy ( that is 8()2). the left handed spinor with spin  1
2

transformed to the left handed spinor of spin 1

2, just as it did under the usual time-reversal

transformation, except that in this case the copy of spinors has been changed.

one can write down the matrix representation for this second kind of the time-reversal

transformation. if we choose for the basis the rst copy of bispinors of table i. and the

fourth copy of bispinors of table i, we obtain the matrix:

t  =





0

0

i2 exp ik

0

0

0

0

i2 exp ik

i2 exp ik

0

0

0

0

i2 exp ik

0

0





,

(65)

where the exp i = 1, due to the choice of the phase of the spinors in table i., and k means

that the complex conjugation has to be performed on the phase coecients only, which in

our case have again been chosen to be one.

27

this is the time-reversal operation discussed by weinberg [8] in appendix c of the

weinbergs book3.

when vectors and scalars are treated in the similar way for either of the two approaches,

it turns out that the time-reversal operators do not transform one copy into another one.

we payed attention in this section on only spin degrees of freedom. the complex conju-

gation aects, of course, the higher part of the internal space as well, aecting the charges

of spinors, vectors and tensors, if one thinks of the extension [2] as discussed in section 9.

viii. unavoidability of families

we want to look at the funny shift of the spin compared to the a priori spin for a eld by

shifting a priori generators m ab = lab + sab out by anther set m ab = lab + sab as a general

nice idea. a prerequisite for that working is that the dierence between the two proposals

for lorentz generators

m ab := m ab  m ab

is also a conserved set of quantities. in the notation above of course we nd

m ab = sab.

(66)

(67)

assuming that there is indeed such two lorentz generator symmetries in a model, we

can ask for the representation under both for a given set of elds, and we can even ask
for representation under the dierence algebra m ab. in order to shift in going from m ab

3the two kinds of the time reversal operators has already been discussed in refs.( [2]). the

appearance of the second kind of the time reversal operator in the weinbergs book as well as in

the wigners book [9] was pointed out [10] to the authors in the workshop what comes beyond

the standard model at bled 1999, when it was suggested that the second kind could generate

states, which may be used to describe the sterile neutrinos.

28

to m ab from integer spin to half integer spin the representation for the elds in question
must at least be spin 1/2 for m ab. actually in the cases we discussed the m ab were in

the dirac spinor representation. but that means that the representation of the elds which
shift representation going from m ab to m ab have to belong under m ab to at least a spin 1/2

which means at least the weyl spin representation of the lorentz group, and that has 2(d/21)

dimensions. but that means then that a given representation of the nal m ab lorentz group

always must occur in at least 2(d/21) families.

ix. generalization to extra dimensions

we have discussed the connection between the grassmann a formulation and the kahler

formalism for general dimension d and thus we could apply it simply in the d=4 case, or we

could use it in extended models with extra dimensions. one should note that the connection

between the spinor and the forms is such that for each extra two dimensions the number

of components of a dirac-spinor goes up by a factor 2, and at the same time the number

of families also doubles. this agrees with that adding one extra a doubles the number of

terms in the a polynomials and thus adding two would make this number four times as big.

let us now study the application of the extra degrees of freedom which consists in

supposing the kahler degrees of freedom or equivalently the grassmann as we discussed

to the case where the d dimensional space is used in a kaluza-klein type model. that is

to say we here look at a kaluza-klein model extended with as or the forms, much more

rich than usual kaluza-klein. it has long been suggested [2] that special kinds of rotations

of the spins especially in the extra (d  4) dimensions manifest themselves as generators

for charges observable at the end for the four dimensional particles. since both the extra

dimension spin degrees of freedom and the ordinary spin degrees of freedom originate from

the as or the forms we have a unication of these internal degrees of freedom. we can

say then that the generators rotating these degrees of freedom, namely the just mentioned

charges acting as hinger dimensional spins (at high energy) and the 4-dimensional spin, are

29

unied.

such rotations of the internal spin degrees of freedom would in order to correspond to a

kaluza-klein gauge elds with massless gauge bosons have to represent full symmetries of

the vacuum state, i.e. they should as in usual kaluza-klein correspond to killing-vectors,

but with the further degrees of freedom also corresponding to symmetry for the latter. so

at the end we may consider also the charges associated with the internal spin as ordinary

klauza-klein charges, of course in the sense of being for the very rich model considered

here. but of course unless we have the a or forms degrees of freedom one could risk that

the gauge eld from such symmetry could be practically decoupled.

let us now look at what the families found in the dirac-kahler will develop into in

case we use it for a kaluza-klein type model, as just proposed: usually the number of

surviving massless fermions into the (3+1) space consists only of those which are connected

with zero-modes. this is to be understood so that we imagine weyl particles in the high

(d) dimensional space because of an atiah-singer theorem in (d  4) dimensional staying

compactied space ensures some modes with the extra dimension part of the dirac operator

gets zero for some number of modes - for each d-dimensional family.

if the model had a strength for compact space atiah-singer theorem a.s.strenght and

if the dimension of the full space, the number of as, is d, so that the number of families at

the d-dimensional level becomes 2d/2, the total number of at low energy observable families

 should be

#f amilies = a.s.strength  2d/2.

(68)

as an example take the model [2] which has d = 14 and at rst - at the high energy

level - so(1, 13) lorentz group, but which should be broken to ( in two steps ) to rst

so(1, 7)  so(6) and then to so(1, 3)  su(3)  su(2).

30

x. discussion of species doubling problem

we may see the appearance of equally many ( namely 2d/21) right handed and left

handed avours  in the kahler model as an expression for the no go theorem [5] for

putting chiral charge conserving fermions on the lattice in as far as we could make attempts

to make lattice fermions along the lines of becher and joos [4] . in fact it would of course

have been a counterexample to the no go [5] theorem if there had been a dierent number of

right and of left weyl particle species in the becher-joos model, because in the free model

the number of particles functions as a conserved charge.

as is very well known the becher-joos model really is just the kogut-susskind [11] lattice

fermion model, it is also well known that it does not violate the no go theorem [5] and this

is because there is this species doubling, which can be interpreted as the avours.

becher and joos show that the kogut-susskind lattice description of dirac elds is

equivalent to the lattice approximation of the dirac-kahler equation.

( see page 344 in

the becher-joos [4] article).

this kogut-susskind model is one that gives us dirac particles, but we can seek to get

to weyl particles in a naive (4) ( or (4) or 5 in the usual notation ) projecting way, but of

course now such a projection would have to be translated into the language with the vector

and scalar elds in the kahlers formulation, and it is rather easy to see [6] that requiring

only one (4) projection implies that the coecient to one p-form say dxh should relate (

just by a sign i) to that of the by the hodge star  associated dxh (see subsection 4.5).

actually we easily see that requiring the restriction that

in the language of kahler becomes

(1 + (4)) = 0

(1 + i)u = 0.

(69)

(70)

if we want like joos and becher to put the theory on the lattice there is a diculty in

just imposing this constraint, because the natural relation imposed by the hodge star  on

31

the lattice would go from lattice to the dual lattice and we could not identify without a

somewhat ambiguous choice the dual of a given lattice element, so as to impose the self

duality condition.

could we possibly invent a way to circumvent the no go theorem [5] for chirality con-

serving fermions on the lattice by making the species doublers bosons instead of fermions,

both having though spin 1/2 ?

in the formulation by one of us which we have related to the kahler formulation there is

( naturally) assigned dierent grassmanian character to dierent components of the wave

function. in fact the wave function with coecients to monomial terms that are products of

dierent sets of ( mutually dierent) a-variables - in the sense of course that a polynomial

is given by its coecients -, and thus the coecients to the products with an even number

of factors have dierent grassmannian character from those of the odd number of factors.

that actually is in the theory of one of us somewhat of an embarrassing reason for a super

selection rule, which though may be overcome by taking into account the charges related

to extra dimensions appearing in that model. but here we now want to point out the hope

that these very grassmann character problems may be used as a new idea to circumvent the

no go theorem. in fact we could hope for that spin 1/2 and say left handed avour appear

with fermionic statistics (the grassmann odd character) while spin 1/2 avour with bosonic

statistics would appear as right handed, and that even on the lattice.

xi. concluding remarks

the way that mankoc [2] chooses to quantize the system, that is a particle moving in

ordinary and grassmann coordinate space, is to let the wave function be allowed to be any

function of the d gassmann variables a, so that any such function represents a state of the

system. but in this quantization the aas can not be put weakly to zero. in other words that

quantization turned out not to obey the equation expected from expression for the canonical

momentum pa, being proportional to the coordinate a as derived from the lagrangian. if,

32

however, in the operators such as the hamiltonian and the lorentz transformation operators

aas are just put strongly to zero, so that all the operators only depend on aa, while either aa

or ab fulll the cliord algebra: {aa, ab} = 0 and {aa, ab} = 2ab = {aa, ab}, the expressions

obtained after having put the aas to zero describe spinor degrees of freedom. in particular,

only the operators sab are used as the lorentz generator. one has accordingly the new

lorentz transformations instead of the a priori one in the wave function on grassmann

space quantization used.

in that case the argument for only having integer spin breaks

down, what the calculations indeed conrm to happen.

we should now attempt to get an understanding of what goes on here by using a basis

inspired from the dirac-kahler-construction, which is a way often used on lattices to im-

plement fermions on the lattice. the dirac-kahler construction starts from a eld theory

with a series of elds which are 0-form, 1-form, 2-form, ...,d-form. they can be thought of

as being expanded on a basis of all the wedge product combinations of the basis dx1, dx2,

...,dxd for the one-forms, including wedge products from zero factors to d factors. in the

dirac-kahler construction one succeeds in constructing out of these all types of forms 2d/2

dirac spinor elds. this construction is without a cheat impossible in much the same way

as mankocs approach ought to be.

we have pointed out clearly in this paper how this cheat occurs in both approaches,

showing up all the similarities of the two approaches and using the simple presentation of

the quantum mechanics in grassmann space to not only simplify the dirac-kahler approach

but also to generalize it. we have shown in particular that in both approaches besides the

(two kinds of ) generators for the lorentz transformations for spinors also the generators

for vectors and tensors exist. there are four copies of the weyl bispinors. one kind of

the spinorial type of the lorentz transformations denes the weyl spinors, another kind

transforms one copy of weyl spinors into another of the same grassmann character. we

also have shown the two kinds of the time reversal operators, as well as the fact that in

grassmann space or space of dierential forms of d dimensions, d > 4, spins and charges

unify. we pointed out the necessity of dening the gamma-matrices of an even grassmann
