in the old papers of ogievetski and polubarinov, hayashi, kalb and
ramond the notoph concept, the longitudinal eld originated from the anti-
symmetric tensor, has been proposed. in our work we analyze the theory of
antisymmetric tensor eld of the second rank from a viewpoint of the nor-
malization problem. we obtain the 4-potentials and eld strengths, which
coincide with those which have been previously obtained in the works of
ahluwalia and dvoeglazov. slightly modifying the bargmann-wigner eld
function we conclude that it is possible to describe explicitly the degrees of
freedom of the photon and of the notoph by the same equation. the phys-
ical consequences, such as parity properties of eld functions, are discussed,
relations to the previous works are discussed as well. moreover, we derive
equations for symmetric tensor of the second rank on the basis of the same
modication of the bargmann-wigner formalism, i. e. the equations which
describe dynamical behavior of the elds of maximal spin 2.

the general outline for derivation of high-spin equations has been given in [1]. a eld
of mass m and spin j  1
2 is represented by a totally-symmetric multispinor of the rank
2j. particular cases j = 1 and j = 3
2 have been given in the textbooks, e. g., ref. [2]. in
the present work we rst prove that the formalism can be generalized for the spin-1 and
spin-3/2 cases. the physical reason for these generalizations is that the ordinary bargmann-
wigner formalism does not take into account the properties of eld functions with respect
to discrete symmetry operations. the spin-2 case can also be of some interest, because
one can assume that the essential features of the gravitational eld (gravitons) are obtained
from the transverse components of the (2, 0)  (0, 2) representation of the lorentz group.

nevertheless, the questions of redundant components in the high-spin relativistic equations
are not yet understood in detail [3].

in a recent series of the papers [49], we tried to construct a consistent theory for the
quantized antisymmetric tensor eld of the second rank, for the 4-vector eld and for the
symmetric tensor eld. the previously published works [1012], textbooks as well, cannot
be considered as the works that solved the main problems: whether the quantized ast eld
and the quantized 4-potential eld are transverse elds or longitudinal ones (in the sense if
the helicity h = 1 or h = 0)? is the electromagnetic potential a 4-vector in the quantized
theory? how should the massless limit be taken? can the symmetric tensor eld of the
second rank be consistently quantized? etc. etc. many problems of the rigorous description
of light and gravitation are still awaiting their solution and explicit presentation. ideas of
this article are based on three referee reports from foundation of physics, even if they
were critical. first of all, we notice after the referee that 1)...in natural units (c = h = 1) a
lagrangian density has (because the action is considered to be dimensionless) dimension of
[energy]4; 2) one can always re-normalize the lagrangian density and one can obtain the
same equations of motion ... by substituting l  (1/m n )l, where m is the arbitrary energy
scale, cf. [5]; 3) the correct physical dimension of the electromagnetic eld tensor f  is
[energy]2; the transformation f   (1/2m)f  (see in ref. [5,6a]) is required a detailed
study, because the mentioned transformation changes its physical dimension:
it is not a
simple normalization transformation. moreover, in the rst articles on the notoph [1012]1
the authors used the normalization of the vector eld f  2 to [energy]2 and, therefore, the
tensor potential a, to [energy]1.

keeping in mind these observations, permit us to repeat the derivation procedure for the
proca equations from the equations of bargmann and wigner for a totally symmetric spinor
of the second rank. we put

{} = (r)(cama + cf f) + cam(5r)a + cf (r)f ,

where

r = (cid:18) i

0

0 i(cid:19) ,  = i2 = (cid:18) 0 1
0 (cid:19) .

(1)

(2)

matrices  are chosen in the weyl representation, i. e., 5 is assumed to be diagonal. the
constants ci are some numerical dimensionless coecients. the reection operator r has
the following properties:

rt = r , r = r = r1 , r15r = (5)t ,
r1r = ()t , r1r = ()t .

(3a)
(3b)

that are necessary for the expansion (1) to be possible in such a form, i. e., r, r
5r are assumed to be symmetric matrices.

1it is also known as a longitudinal eld of kalb and ramond, but the ogievetski and polubarinov
consideration seems to be more rigorous because it allows us to study the limit m  0.
2it is well known that the notoph eld is related to a eld tensor of the third rank.

2

the substitution of the preceding expansion into the bargmann and wigner set [2]

[i  m] {}(x) = 0 ,
[i  m] {}(x) = 0

(4a)
(4b)

gives us the new equations of proca:

cam(a  a) + cf (f  f) = icam2 a + 2mcf f
cam2a + cf mf = icama + 2cf f .

(5a)
(5b)
in the case ca = 1, cf = 1
2 , cf = ca = 0 they reduce to the ordinary proca equations.3 in the
generalized case one obtains dynamical equations that connect the photon, the notoph and
their potentials. divergent parts (in m  0) of eld functions and of dynamical variables
should be removed by corresponding gauge transformations (either electrtomagnetic gauge
transformations or kalb-ramond gauge transformations). it is well known that the massless
notoph eld turns out to be a pure longitudinal eld when one keeps in mind a = 0.

apart from these dynamical equations, we can obtain a set of constraints by means
of subtraction of the equations of bargmann and wigner (instead of their addition as in
(5a,5b)). they are read

mcaa + cf f = 0,

and mcaa +

i

cf f  = 0 .

that suggest ef   ima f   ma, like in [10].
we returned to these old works due to recent interpretational controversies after exper-
imental observations of the objects e  e, b(1)  b(2) and a  a in nonlinear optics.
in this respect one can consider that  a  a can be a part of the tensor potential
the formulas (19a-c) in ref. [6a]).4 fol-
and  b  b, a part of the vector eld (cf.
lowing [10, eqs.(9,10)] we proceed in the construction of the potentials for the notoph:
 (p)i upon using explicit forms of the polarization vec-
a(p)  h(1)

tors in the linear momentum space (e. g., refs. [14] and [6a, formulas (15a, b)]). one obtains

3however, we noticed that the division by m in the rst equation is not well-dened operation in
the case when somebody becomes interested in the m  0 limit later on. probably, in order to avoid
this dark point, one may wish to write the dirac equation in the form [(i)/m  11] (x) = 0,
the one that follows immediately in the derivation of the dirac equation on the basis of the ryder
relation [13,7] and the wigner rules for a boost of the eld function from the system with zero
linear momentum.

4recently we proved (physics/9907048) that such cross products can have various transformations
properties with respect to the lorentz transformations on the corresponding transverse elds. the
physical origin is the possibility of construction of various eld operators, diering by properties
with respect to the c and cp discrete operations.

which coincides with the longitudinal components of the antisymmetric tensor which have
been obtained in refs. [8, eqs. (2.14,2.17)] and in [6a, eqs. (17b,18b)] within normalization
and dierent forms of the spinorial basis. the longitudinal states can be eliminated in the
massless case when one adapted suitable normalization and if a j = 1 particle moves along
the third-axis oz direction.
it is also useful to compare eq. (7) with the formula (b2)
in ref. [9], the expressions for the strengths in the light-front form of the qft, in order to
realize the correct procedure for taking the massless limit.

as a discussion we want to mention that the tam-happer experiment [15] did not nd a
satisfactory explanation in the quantumelectrodynamic frameworks (at least, its explanation
is complicated by tedious technical calculus). on the other hand, in ref. [16] an interesting
model has been proposed. it is based on gauging the dirac eld on using a set of parameters
which are dependent on space-time coordinates (x) in (x)  (x) = (x),
 =
exph i

2(x)i . thus, the second photon has been taken into consideration. the 24-

component compensation eld b, reduces to the 4-vector eld as follows (the notation
of [16] is used here): b, = 1
4 a(x) . as you can readily see after the comparison of
the formulas of [16] with those of refs. [1012], the second photon of pradhan and naik
is nothing more than the ogievetski-polubarinov notoph within the normalization. parity
properties (massless behavior as well) are the matter of dependence, not only on the explicit
forms of the eld functions in the momentum space (1/2, 1/2) representation, but also on
the properties of the corresponding creation/annihilation operators. the helicity properties
in the massless limit depend on the normalization.

we can generalize the formalism in a slightly dierent way. in the works [17] generaliza-

tions of the dirac formalism have been proposed. one of them has the form

hi  m1  5m2i (x) = 0

(8)

with two mass parameters and they allow the description of tachyonic states and, probably,
the explanation of the mass hierarchy [18]. if one wants to build the formalism for high
spins on the basis of the equation (8), one comes to the following system of proca equations
for spin 1:5

2c1 ef   2ic2a + m2 = 0 ,
2c1f  + 2ic2 ea + m1 = 0 ,
2c1(m1f  + im2 ef ) + 2c2(m2a + im1 ea)  (  ) = 0 ,

 = 0 .

the eld function was assumed to be represented in this case by

{} = (r) + c1(r)f + c2(5r)a .

(9a)
(9b)
(9c)
(9d)

(10)

5for the spin- 3/2 case the equations are very similar. it is only necessary to consider that the
spin-3/2 function takes an additional index which is related to its spinorial part. however, new
restrictions, thanks to the symmetrization procedure of the third-rank multispinor, appear (see
ref. [2]).

4

the use of two mass parameters can also be useful for the consideration of the pauli-lubanski
vector and the study of its massless limit (see [6a, eq. (27,28)]). the latter is interesting to
a reader because the choices m1 = m2 provide us with alternative formulation for massless
particles pp = 0, even though a theory contains a parameter with dimension of mass.
furthermore, upon repeating the generalized formalism for a fourth-rank symmetric mul-

tispinor

the essential constraints are given in appendix b. they are the results of contractions
of the eld function (4-rank symmetric multispinor) with three antisymmetric matrices
r1, r15, r15, as has been done previously in the standard formalism (see [2] for
the case of j = 3/2).

moreover, one obtains the second-order equation for the second-rank symmetric tensor

from a set of equations (12a-12d) (1 6= 0, 1 6= 0):

i. e., to the equations that connect an analog of the metric tensor and an analog of the
4-potential.6 the gravitation theory based on these dynamical equations is certainly related

considers g as the energy-momentum tensor.

to the logunovs relativistic theory of gravitation (rtg), cf. [21, 36]. furthermore, in the
linearized version of gravitation theory (which may follow from the presented formalism) 
in fact, in a weak limit  only certain chiral components of the 4-rank symmetric multispinor
contribute, as discussed in [22].

in conclusion, we can say that in a series of work it was rmly established: 1) the physical
signicance of the normalization has been proved; 2) the notoph concept, i. e. the formalisms
for the ogievetski-polubarinov-kalb-ramond longitudinal eld, the torsion eld, the gauge
string eld etc. are all connected to each other and are related to the helicity-0 component
of the antisymmetric tensor eld of the second rank; 3) we proved that one can describe
the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom by the same equation with unknown
numerical coecients [6b]; 4) the dependence of coecient functions in the eld operators
for higher spins on rotations of the frame of reference suggest interpretation of higher-spin
particles as composite particles; 5) the same procedure as for elds of spin-0 and spin-1 has
been applied to the case of spin 2 (and, presumably, it should be applied to the cases of
higher spins) for the reason that the standard formalism has problems with interpretation of
the existence of the trivial solutions only [6c]; 6) relative intrinsic parities of various tensors7
considered in the present paper are dierent and this fact forbids the identication of the
physical contents of theories containing/not containing dual tensors.

they are not divergent in the massless limit if we take n = m. they describe the longitudi-
nal photons (in the sense that h = 0) in this limit. if n = 1 one has transverse photons
but we also have the divergent conduct of the gauge part of the eld functions [20, 3.2.3].8

7this is obviously measurable quantity.

8this fact induced someone to consider additional scalar eld (i. e. j = 0 eld, sic!) in order to
make the spin-1 formalism to be consistent. it is the stueckelberg formulation.

we can see, they are related to the gauge part of ( p) of the 4-potential in the momentum
