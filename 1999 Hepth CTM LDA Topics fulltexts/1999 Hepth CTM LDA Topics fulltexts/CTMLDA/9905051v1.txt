abstract

we study the problem of decoupling fermion elds in 1 + 1 and
2 + 1 dimensions, in interaction with a gauge eld, by performing lo-
cal transformations of the fermions in the functional integral. this
could always be done if singular (large) gauge transformations were
allowed, since any gauge eld conguration may be represented as
a singular pure gauge eld. however, the eect of a singular gauge
transformation of the fermions is equivalent to the one of a regular
transformation with a non-trivial action on the spinorial indices. for
example, in the two dimensional case, singular gauge transformations
lead naturally to chiral transformations, and hence to the usual decou-
pling mechanism based on fujikawa jacobians. in 2 + 1 dimensions,
using the same procedure, dierent transformations emerge, which

also give rise to fujikawa jacobians. we apply this idea to obtain the
v.e.v of the fermionic current in a background eld, in terms of the
jacobian for an innitesimal decoupling transformation, nding the
parity violating result.

1 introduction

we shall be concerned with z(a), the generating functional for massless
fermions in the presence of an external gauge eld a, in d (euclidean)
spacetime dimensions:

z[a] = z d d exp(cid:20)z ddx (6  + i 6a)(cid:21) ,

(1)

for the cases d = 2 and d = 3.

we start from the observation that any non-trivial, regular, external
gauge eld coupled to fermions can always be written in terms of a pure
gauge eld. the price to be paid is that the gauge eld transformation as-
sociated with this pure gauge eld is necessarily a singular one. it is then
possible to perform a singular gauge transformation rendering the fermion
action free. the procedure is of course formal, in the sense that singularities
in the fermionic transformations make complicated to check whether the new
variables are strictly free and, moreover, whether they induce a non-trivial
jacobian at the quantum level.

these are indeed the reasons why these transformations cannot be naively
used to decouple fermions from an external gauge eld. we shall see, however,
that there is a way to make sense of them. the clue for this, lies in the
observation that a singular gauge transformation for the fermions can be
written in terms of a regular transformation that is not the same for all the
spinor components. namely, this regular transformation does not change
all components of the spinor with the same phase factor and can also mix
dierent components.

to understand the statements above, consider the case of 2 space-time
dimensions. it is well-known in this case that a local regular chiral transfor-
mation decouples massless fermions from the gauge eld 1. when performed
as a path-integral change of variables, the decoupling chiral transformation
leads to a free fermionic action but has an associated non-trivial jacobian[1].
its calculation [2] allows one to have a complete control of the decoupled
theory at the quantum level. what is less known is that there is an alterna-
tive way of decoupling two-dimensional massless fermions and this through
a singular gauge transformation. as we shall see, one can nd a connec-
tion between both transformations, the regular chiral one and the singular

time point.

gauge one. chiral transformations suer from the well-known anomaly phe-
nomenon, an eect of far-reaching consequences [3]. these eects manifest
themselves both in the operatorial and path-integral versions of the theory.
concerning the path-integral framework, since the transformed action
is free, a non-trivial jacobian taking into account quantum eects is to be
expected and it should coincide with the chiral jacobian since both transfor-
mations left us with the same free action.

this two-dimensional example shows that either transformation, one that
changes all spinor components with the same (singular) phase and the other
changing each component with regular phases diering in signs, can be used
to completely decouple massless fermions from an external gauge eld.

once one is convinced that at least in d = 2 dimensions the two ap-
proaches are equivalent, however dierent their derivations seem to be, one
can try to make sense of singular transformations for d = 3 and to determine
what kind of equivalent regular transformation emerges. this is the main
purpose of the present work. we shall see that in d = 3 dimensions, it is
possible to obtain non perturbative information through the connection of
innitesimal singular gauge transformations with regular ones, whose jaco-
bian can be calculated. in particular, using the procedure described above,
we compute the v.e.v. of the fermion current in an abelian gauge eld back-
ground in d = 3, nding the well-known parity violating result [4]-[5]. in the
present case the parity anomaly stems from the non-triviality of a fujikawa
jacobian as it happens in even dimensions with the axial anomaly and the
chiral jacobian.

the plan of the paper is as follows: we rst discuss in section 2 the two-
dimensional case in which the connection between singular gauge and regular
chiral transformations is transparent. inspired by this example, we discuss
in section 3 the three dimensional case, computing the fujikawa jacobian
for an innitesimal regular transformation. we then apply this result to the
evaluation of the v.e.v. of the fermion current in the presence of an external
eld.

2 the abelian case in d = 2

this is of course the simplest case we may consider. since, for massless
fermions, the fermionic determinant may be exactly calculated, everything
may be checked on the safe ground of the exact solutions. the rst step in the

4

construction of the large gauge transformations is similar to one used in the
chiral transformation approach, namely, the decomposition of the external
gauge eld a into the sum of a gradient of a scalar  plus the curl of a
pseudoscalar :

a =  +   .

(2)

of course, the only pure gauge part of a is, at this point, the gradient term.
we can however always force the curl term to also look as a pure gauge, if
we dene another scalar eld , such that

  =  .

taking the curl on both sides of (3), we see that

  = 2 = f ,

(3)

(4)

where f (x)  a(x).

thus, the partial derivatives do not commute when acting on , except
in the trivial case f = 0. we shall also see that the singularity is of the
branching point type, namely,  is a sort of angular variable (see (17) below).
note that the singularities are in , not on  which is the gauge invariant
part of the gauge eld, and for which we shall assume a trivial topology.

by using (2) and (3), the fermionic action may be written as

sf = z d2x [6  + i 6 ( + )]

(5)

where the fermions are coupled just to a pure gauge. this suggests the
introduction of the singular (because of ) decoupling transformations

(x) = exp[i((x) + (x))](x)
(x) = (x) exp[i((x) + (x))] ,

(6)

which are the transformations we want to make sense of. of course we will
ignore the -dependent part, since it is regular and produces no anomalous
jacobian (in an invariant regularization, which we shall assume). to un-
derstand the nature of the singularity, let us consider again equation (3),
dening .
integrating both sides along a given curve c, with origin at a
xed point p of coordinates xp , and end at the point of coordinates x, we
see that

d   .

(7)

(x)  (xp ) = z x

xp

5

z d2x a = 0 .

(10)

of course, the value of (x) will be, in general, dependent on both p and c.
we shall put the point p at innity.

in order to avoid the existence of zero modes for the dirac operator, we

shall assume that

ir

d  = 0

(8)

holds. (the sux r   means that the circulation is to be calculated along
a circle of innite radius). indeed, because of eq,(2), eq.(8) is equivalent to

ir

d a = 0 .

(9)

and, by stokes theorem, this is tantamount to requiring the net magnetic
ux to vanish

a non-zero total ux would imply the existence of zero modes, and the
vanishing of the determinant of the dirac operator in such a background.
for a non-trivial (although topologically trivial) a, the function  will have
singularities, since the circulation of a along at least one nite closed curve
will be non-zero.

that the transformations (6) are not justied should be self-evident: the
new fermionic elds will have singularitites introduced by the transformation,
which then takes the original elds out of the initial space. to make sense
of these transformations, we rst consider an innitesimal version of the
singular part of (6)

(x) = i (x)(x)
 (x) = i (x)(x)

(11)

where  is an innitesimal parameter.

it is important to realize at this point that in the action (5) it is not 
but 6  what appears, and this particular combination is regular. to see this,
we just need to use the identity

6 [(x) + i5(x)] = 0

(12)

which is a consequence of the two dimensional dirac algebra (we shall see
however that a similar relation exists in d = 3). we want to remark that
(12) relates the (regular) derivatives of  to the (also regular) derivatives of .

6

then one realizes that, because of (12), the eect of a chiral transformation
is equivalent to the eect of a non-chiral large gauge transformation. (note
that we are not saying that the singular eld  is somehow transformed into
a regular eld by multiplying it by 5).

in this way, and just by the use of (12), one arrives to an equivalent

representation of the action (5),

sf = z d2x [6  + i 6 + 6 5]

(13)

which is of course the starting point of the usual decoupling by a chiral
transformation. we may then forget the singular transformation induced
by  in favour of the regular one generated by i5, which is a chiral
transformation. they may dier at most in a transformation generated by
, a solution of the free equation

6   = 0 .

(14)

equation (14) implies that each component of  has to be either analytic or
anti-analytic on the plane. thus they are constants. we have learnt that
the only thing we could miss by replacing the vector singular transforma-
tion by the chiral regular one is the jacobian due to a general global chiral
transformation: this is a -vacua term, which is zero because of (10).

the regular innitesimal transformations (corresponding to the singular

ones, eq.(11), are

(x) = (x)5(x)
 (x) =  (x)5(x) .

(15)

once one obtains this formula for the regular transformation, one proceeds
in the usual way to derive the jacobian, which will of course need regulariza-
tion. note that the parameter of the transformation is actually the same one
uses when dealing with the standard procedure involving anomalous chiral
jacobians [1].

we conclude this section by presenting the explicit form of the elds 
and , since in two dimensions their expressions are particularly simple and
illuminating 2. for , we have

2similar relations appear in dierent contexts, see for example [6].

2 z d2y ln[|x  y|]f (y)

(x) = 

(16)

7

where  is a constant with the dimensions of a mass. regarding , it is also
immediate to see that

(x) =

1

2 z d2y(x  y)f (y)

(17)

where (x) = arg( x2
). it is obvious that  has discontinuities, associated
x1
with the branching point of the angle function , while  does not suer
from those singularities. equations (17) and (16) can be collected into a
single matrix equation

 (x) + i5(x) =

1

2 z d2y ln [x1  y1 + i5(x2  y2)] f (y) .

(18)

either from these relations, or even from (3), we may see that  and 
satisfy the cauchy-riemann equations, and are then the real and imaginary
parts of an analytic function:

f =  + i ,


 z

f = 0 .

(19)

we may rephrase the equivalence between regular chiral and large non
chiral transformations by saying that the eect of a gauge transformation
generated by  is equivalent to the one of a chiral transformation generated
by the dual of , which is . the term dual is understood here in the sense
that vortex-like congurations (remember  is angular), are transformed into
coulomb congurations (i.e., the potential of a charge distribution).

of course, this picture also holds the other way around: a singular chiral
pure gauge eld is equivalent to a regular non-chiral pure gauge eld, and
thus it can be gauged away! the fermions are free in this case. the reason
for the asymmetry between these case and the original one is that one
usually regulates the jacobian using the operator 6d. a more general choice
would put both cases on a similar footing.

3 the abelian case in d = 3

we consider again the generating functional (1), but for the d = 3 case.
now the (hermitian)  matrices satisfy the relations

  = i + i  ,

(20)

8

where i denotes the identity matrix.

the decomposition of a is now slightly dierent, since a general a con-
guration will have three independent components. we shall use a scalar
eld  and a pseudovector ,

a =  +  .

(21)

the decomposition (21) apparently includes 1 + 3 = 4 components on the
right hand side. note, however, that a is insensitive to the transformations

   +  ,

(22)

which reduce by one the actual number of components. we can in fact impose
a gauge condition on , the natural choice being the lorentz condition

   = 0 ,

(23)

which we shall adopt. we may again write the curl term in (21) as the
gradient of a scalar eld ,

of course  will have singularities

 =  .

 =     2 = 2 = f

(24)

(25)

whenever f  a 6= 0. integrating along a curve starting at a point
p at innity, we may write

(x)  (xp ) = z x

xp

d  .

the fermionic action would then be

sf = z d3x [6  + i 6 ( + )]

(26)

(27)

where the fermions are coupled to a (singular) pure gauge eld. the singu-
lar decoupling transformations are then formally the same as for the two-
dimensional case (6)

(x) = exp[i(x)](x)
(x) = (x) exp[i(x)] .

(28)

9

we then introduce regular innitesimal transformations in exactly the same
way as in the two dimensional case. the three dimensional analog of (12)

6  [(x) + i 6 (x)] = 0 .

thus we are led to consider the innitesimal regular transformations

(x) =  6 (x)(x)
 (x) = (x) 6 (x) .

(29)

(30)

which are the innitesimal regular version of the decoupling singular transfor-
mations (28). in the present d = 3 case, we shall only perform innitesimal
decoupling transformations, which will allow us to compute v.e.v. of fermion
currents j = iz[a]/a. we then need to consider a variation on a in
z[a]

z[a + a] = z d d exp(cid:20)z ddx (6  + i(6a+ 6a)(cid:21) .

(31)

now, an innitesimal change of fermion elds like (30) can be used to elimi-
nate a from the action. that change will, very likely, produce a non trivial
jacobian j[a, a],

with

z[a + a] = j[a, a]z[a]

j[a, a] = exp(cid:18)z d3x a g[a](cid:19) .

(32)

(33)

to obtain the connection between  and a, note that from the relation
(21) between  and a, we can write

a

 =  ,

(34)

where  denotes transverse components. we shall connect the jacobian (33)
associated with a general gauge eld variation a (i.e. including longitudinal
components) with that associated with a
 ,

j [a + a] = exp(cid:18)z d3x a a[a](cid:19) .

(35)

10

to this end, note that a
 can be thought of as a a variation in a gauge
where the corresponding longitudinal component is xed to zero.
includ-
ing the 3 possible dierent choices for that component gives then twice the
general variation we were looking for. thus, a factor 3/2 should be included,

g[a] =

3
2

a[a] .

(36)

let us now compute the anomalous jacobian associated with transfor-
mations (30). indeed, under those transformations, the anomalous jacobian
reecting the change in the fermionic integration measure is

j = jj 
d  d j
d   d  j  .

(37)

the jacobians j and j  may be evaluated, to the rst order in , as
follows

j = exp[tr 6 ]
j  = exp[tr 6 ] ,

(38)

where the trace is both functional and over the dirac indices. this trace,
as it happens in the d = 2 case, is ill-dened, and needs regularization. in
general, we shall have

where

[tr  6 ]reg = z d3x (x) areg

 (x)

areg

 (x) = tr[hx| f (6d, i)|xi]

(39)

(40)

where i (i = 1, 2, . . .) are the pauli-villars regulator masses , f is a reg-
ulating function (which tends to 1 for large values of i and regulates uv
divergences), and tr denotes the trace over dirac indices. we shall choose a
pauli-villars regulator of the form

f (6d, i) =

12

2  1  

1

6d + 1



1

6d + 2!

(41)

11

where two regulators i (i = 1, 2) with same sign are enough to ensure that
innities are eliminated in the limit i  . only one term in the trace
survives in this limit,

areg

 (x) = 

i

24

2 + o(

)

(42)

where the  results from the (common) sign choice for the is. this yields,
for the jacobian j,

j = exp(cid:18)

i

24 z d3x2a(cid:19) .

the result for j  is identical so that the total jacobian reads

j = exp(cid:18)

i

12 z d3x2a(cid:19) .

(43)

(44)

we then see that there is a non-trivial jacobian associated with transfor-
mations (30), the regular and innitesimal version of the singular gauge
transformations (28).
in this sense transformations (28) (or their regular
counterparts (30) are anomalous. using eqs.(33)-(36) we get from (44) the
jacobian associated with a a variation

ja = exp(cid:18)

i

8 z d3xaa(cid:19)

(45)

from this we compute the v.e.v. of the fermionic current in the presence of
an external gauge eld, obtaining

j = 

1
8

a

(46)

this result coincides with the one originally obtained by redlich [4]-[5] for
the parity violating part of the fermion current in a constant eld strength
background, using the schwinger method for evaluating the euler-heisenberg
eective action. in our calculation, valid for arbitrary eld strength, j arises
from a fujikawa jacobian. it should be noted that our regularization pre-
scription (eqs.(41)) neglects the parity conserving part (which is absent in
[5] because a constant eld strength is considered).

it is worth remarking that the decoupling procedure followed here diers
from the one applied in [7], since in that reference the decoupling trans-
formations are non-local. moreover, those non-local transformations induce
non-anomalous (but nevertheless non-trivial) jacobians.

12

also note that, both in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions, a mass term for
the fermions is not invariant under a regular transformation, what makes it
dicult to relate the eects of singular and regular transformations.

we conclude by stressing that both in 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 dimensions the
method presented in this work follows exactly the same steps: one rst writes
a singular gauge transformation - a nite decoupling one in 1 + 1 dimensions,
an innitesimal one in 2 + 1 dimensions. then, one nds a regular equivalent
transformation on fermions which can be properly handled. associated with
these transformations there are, at the quantum level, anomalous jacobians
which, for the regular transformations, can be easily computed. the jaco-
bians, associated with the chiral anomaly in 1 + 1 dimensions and the parity
anomaly in 2 + 1 dimensions, correctly describe quantum aspects in both
cases. this provides an alternative way of understanding exactly soluble two
dimensional fermion models but also of computing relevant v.e.v.s in higher
dimensions. in fact, the same procedure described here could be applied to
the calculation of the v.e.v. of the axial current in 3 + 1 dimensions (through
a decoupling transformation analysis, which shall involve the chiral anomaly
in 3 + 1 dimensions), the v.e.v. of the fermion current in 4 + 1 dimensions
(related to the 4 + 1 dimensional parity anomaly), etc, with the advantage
that the procedure is systematic and relies on the calculation of anomalous
jacobians whose regularization is well-understood.
