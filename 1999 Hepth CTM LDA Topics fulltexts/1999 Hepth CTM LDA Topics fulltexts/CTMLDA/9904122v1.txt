abstract

in this paper we consider iia and iib matrix string theories which are dened by two-
dimensional and three-dimensional super yang-mills theory with the maximal supersym-
metry, respectively. we exactly compute the partition function of both of the theories by
mapping to a cohomological eld theory. our result for the iia matrix string theory co-
incides with the result obtained in the infra-red limit by kostov and vanhove, and thus
gives a proof of the exact quasi classics conjectured by them. further, our result for the iib
matrix string theory coincides with the exact result of ikkt model by moore, nekrasov and
shatashvili. it may be an evidence of the equivalence between the two distinct iib matrix
models arising from dierent roots.

1 introduction

a recent great development of nonperturbative aspects of superstring theory has begun with
following two events. one is a proposal of m-theory [1], which is a hypothetical theory
describing strongly coupled region of type iia superstring theory and reduces to eleven-
dimensional supergravity in the low energy limit. the relation among parameters of string
theory (the string length ls and the string coupling gs) and of eleven-dimensional supergravity
(the planck length l11 and the radius of compactied the 11-th direction r11) is given by

r11 = gsls = g2/3

s

l11.

(1)

m-theory gives a systematic view point for string theory  in considering the m-theory,
all known perturbative string theories are unied via various connections from duality. the
other is a discovery of d-branes [2], which are solitonic solutions of string theory and can be
constructed by using conformal eld theory in a well-dened manner. thus they are powerful
tools for investigating nonperturbative phenomena in string theory. further, it was followed
by a new interpretation of dimensional reductions of ten-dimensional supersymmetric yang-
mills (sym) theory as low energy eective theories for dynamics of the d-branes [3].

those movements culminated in the conjecture by banks, fischler, shenker and susskind
(bfss) [4], that ten-dimensional sym theory dimensionally reduced to one dimension which
describes the low energy dynamics of d0-branes so far, in the innite momentum frame, gives
a constructive denition of the m-theory. this one-dimensional sym quantum mechanical
model is called m(atrix) theory. moreover, by considering toroidal compactications on a
circle and on a two-torus in the manner of taylor [5], it leads to a proposal for a nonpertur-
bative denition of type iia superstring theory [6, 7] and that of type iib superstring theory
[7, 8], respectively. in this paper, we call them iia and iib matrix string theories. the iia
matrix string theory is given by ten-dimensional sym theory dimensionally reduced to two-
dimensions, and the string coupling constant corresponds to the inverse of the sym coupling.
also, the iib matrix string theory is a dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional sym
theory to three dimensions. the string coupling is given by a ratio of lengths of two spatial
dimensions of the three-dimensional sym theory. in addition, with respect to another non-
perturbative denition of type iib superstrings [9], which is in form of the ten-dimensional
sym theory reduced to a point (zero dimension), proposed by ishibashi, kawai, kitazawa
and tsuchiya, it is referred to ikkt model.

those matrix string theories successfully reproduce some of known results obtained from
an analysis of bps saturated states consisting of fundamental strings, d-branes and their
bound states [10]. this fact is considered as one of evidences that the matrix string theories
truely are constructive denitions of string theories. however, with respect to nonpertur-
bative dynamics of the string theories, in order to investigate it we cannot help treating
nonperturbative dynamics of the sym theory sides. though understanding of this area is
now in development [11, 12], unfortunately at present it seems to be not powerful enough
for handling the problem.

in this paper, we consider the partition function of the matrix string theories  it is one of

1

the most fumdamental quantities reecting dynamical property of vacua of the theories. the
partition function of the iia matrix string theory was computed in strongly coupled limit of
the sym theory by kostov and vanhove [13]. for the partition function of the ikkt model,
the exact result was obtained by interpreting the theory as a cohomological eld theory by
moore, nekrasov and shatashvili [14]. here, we exactly calculate the partition function of
both of iia and iib matrix string theories by mapping the theories to cohomological eld
theories. in the iia case our result coincides with the result obtained in the strongly coupled
limit, which thus gives a proof of exact quasi classics discussed in [13]. also in the iib case,
our result agrees with the exact calculation for the ikkt model, which seems to suggest the
equivalence between those two dierent nonperturbative formulations of iib string theory.
the paper is organized as follows. in the next section, we introduce the iia and iib
matrix string theories via toroidal compactications of the m(atrix) theory. we briey
explain how string interactions emerge from the sym theory and show how spinors with
correct chirality appear. in section 3, as a preparation for computing the partition function
of the matrix strings, we evaluate the partition function of four-dimensional n = 4 su(n)
sym theory dened on a four-torus by mapping the theory to a cohomological eld theory
via a twisting procedure. then in section 4, we exactly compute the partition function
of the iia matrix string theory, and see that our result coincides with the result in the
infra-red limit by kostov and vanhove. in section 5, for the partition function of the iib
matrix string theory we perform the calculation in the ten-dimensional iib limit, and nd
the identical result with the partition function of the ikkt model by moore, nekrasov and
shatashvili. finally, section 6 is devoted to conclusions.
in appendix a, we clarify the
connection between two-dimensional n = 2 sym theory and a cohomological eld theory
used in section 4.

2 matrix strings

in this section we review some basic properties of the iia and iib matrix string theories,
which are derived from the m(atrix) theory by considering toroidal compactications to s1
and to t 2 respectively.
in addition, we give an argument that two spinors of the same
space-time chirality emerge in the iib matrix string theory, which has not been found in the
literatures.

we start with the m(atrix) theory [4], whose action has the same form as low energy eec-
tive action of n d0-branes, that is one-dimensional u(n) sym theory with 16 supercharges.
the bfss conjecture is that this action exactly describes m-theory in the decompactied
limit r11   by going to the innite momentum frame. the innite momentum frame
means innite amount of boosting along the 11th direction, i.e. momentum of the 11th
direction becomes

p11 =

n
r11  .

(2)

at the same time we must take the limit n, r11  , in order that the resulting theory
represents the strongly coupled limit of type iia superstring theory.

2.1

iia matrix string theory

let us consider the compactication of one of the transverse directions, say the 9th, to a
circle of the circumference l, denoted by s1(l). since in the m(atrix) theory we consider
the limit that the 11th direction is decompactied, we have ten-dimensional type iia string
theory with the string length

l2
s =

2l3
11
l

.

(3)

according to the prescription of taylor [5], this iia string theory is described by two-
dimensional n = 8 u(n) sym theory, which is a dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional
n = 1 sym theory [6],

here, f = a  a  i[a, a] is a eld strength made from two-dimensional gauge
eld a, x i (i = 1,   , 8) are higgs elds and  ( = 1,   , 16) are fermions. we use the
convention that the -matrices are 16  16 real symmetric matrices satisfying

{i, j} = 2ij,

9 = 1    8.

(5)

s are decomposed into the spinor and conjugate spinor representations (8s 8c) of the ro-
tational group in the transverse directions so(8), which are characterized by the eigenvalues
of 9, so called chirality:

and x is transform as the vector 8v. the spatial coordinate , which arises as performing
the compactication, takes a value on the circle dual to s1(l): 0    r, where2

(7)

(8)

weakly coupled strings are recovered by considering the limit gs  0 or equivalently
the infra-red limit of the sym theory [6]. in this situation, the theory is described by the
eigenvalues of the simultaneously diagonalizable congurations of x i and :

x i = diag(xi

1,   , xi

n ),

 = diag(

1 ,   , 
n )

(9)

2 the relation between parameters in the matrix string theory and those in sym theory, eqs. (7) and
(8) in the iia case as well as eqs. (18), (19) and (20) in the iib case, can be derived either by tracing the
procedure by taylor [5] or by employing another argument in ref. [15].

3

where

x i = v x iv ,

(10)
the angular variables v  u(n) and nontrivial congurations of the gauge eld yielding
non-zero curvature f are energetically decoupled from the theory in the infra-red limit, and
the action (4) reduces to the action of multiple green-schwarz superstrings in the light-cone
gauge. then the gauge eld can take the pure gauge conguration

 = v v .

a = iv v .

(11)

also, the xi
conguration:

i and 

i can represent strings of various lengths by considering the multi-valued

x i(t,  + r) = g x i(t, )g,
v (t,  + r) = v (t, )g,

(t,  + r) = g (t, )g,

(12)

where g is an element of the weyl group of u(n), i.e. the permutation group sn , which
permutes the n eigenvalues.
in going around the -direction, the eigenvalues are inter-
changed by the action of g in eqs. (12), and as a result they form cycles of various lengths
corresponding to permutation cycles in g. each cycle is interpreted as a single closed string,

with length n.

and thus for g  sn consisting of nn n-cycles (satisfying n = pn nnn) one has nn strings

note that the total matrices x i,  in eqs. (10) and the gauge eld a, which appear
in the sym theory, remain single-valued although we consider the case that the variables of
string coordinates x i and  are multi-valued as in eqs. (12), which is argued in ref. [16].
for the simplest n = 2 case, the multi-valued conguration is represented by

x i =   xi

where

2(t, ),

xi

1(t, ),

i satises the same boundary condition. the matrices x i,  and a are single-valued.

and 
in particular, the gauge eld is

at = 0,

a =

1

2   1 0

0 0 ! ,

(14)

which cannot be eliminated by any single-valued gauge transformation.

as discussed in [6], relaxing the strict limit gs = 0, the number of the strings are no
longer conserved. we can interpret this as a result of string interactions (splitting or join-
ing of one or two strings) which occur when the two sets of eigenvalues {xi
i}i=1,,8 and
j}i=1,,8 coincide. whenever the interaction occurs, the boundary condition of x i, 
{xi
and v is changed, i.e. a branch point appears on a cylinder coordinated by t and . we

4

should remark that as discussed in [17], in spite of this singular conguration of the diagonal
variables, for a neighborhood of the branch point the corresponding total matrices exist as
a smooth and single-valued conguration of the sym theory. in the section 4 of ref.
[17]
such a conguration is constructed in the n = 2 case, which is given by a solution of the di-
mensionally reduced version of the self-dual equation of four-dimensional yang-mills theory
to two dimensions:

i
g2 ft,
[x1, x2] =
dtx1 = dx2,
dtx2 = dx1,

(15)

(16)

and the all other elds are set to zero. compared to the conguration in the strict limit
(g2 = ) that is [x1, x2] = 0, the o(1/g2)-correction in eq. (15) works well to make the
conguration in the sym theory smooth.

2.2

iib matrix string theory

when compactifying iia string theory to a circle and taking t-dual to the circle, we have
iib string theory on s1. in the limit of shrinking the circle of the iia theory, the s1 of the
iib theory is decompactied, thus we have iib string theory in ten dimensions. from the
view point of m-theory, iia theory on s1 means m-theory on t 2. we denote the size of the
two-torus by l1 and l2, i.e. t 2 = s1(l1)  s1(l2). since there is no distinctive meaning
between the two s1s, now we have two ways to obtain iib theory corresponding to shrinking
either l1 or l2. from the analysis based on low energy eective theories, two iib theories
we obtain as the result are believed to be equivalent and connected by s-duality [18, 19].
in this way, the m-theory perspective yields a geometrical interpretation to the s-duality in
type iib string theory.

let us consider this operation in the m(atrix) theory. then we obtain three-dimensional
n = 8 u(n) sym theory, which is dimensionally reduced from the ten-dimensional theory,
as a matrix model corresponding to iib theory on s1 [7, 8]:

(17)

here we compactied the 8th and 9th transverse directions to the above mentioned (rect-
angular) two-torus. the size of the spatial directions (1 and 2) which the sym theory is
dened on is related by t-duality to the two-torus,

(i = 1, 2),

(18)

ri = (2)2 l2

and the sym coupling are given by

it is remarkable that the string coupling is given by a ratio of the two lengths of the torus:

g2 =

(2)2l4
s

.

(19)

gs =

r1
r2

=

l2
l1

,

(20)

which gives the geometrical understanding of s-duality also in the matrix string level. in the
vanishing torus limit l1, l2  0, a new dimension opens up and becomes decompactied, so
this limit with the ratio l2/l1 xed is considered to give type iib theory of the coupling gs
determined by eq. (20) [8, 15]. note that the abelian part of the eld strength f made from
three-dimensional gauge eld a reduces to a single scalar eld via duality transformation.
although the manifest symmetry of the action (17) is so(7), it is considered that this
scalar and the seven higgs elds x i (i = 1,   , 7) together belong to 8v in so(8) in the
ten-dimensional iib limit
(21)

gs : xed

r1r2  ,

by the argument for bps states [15] and by the analysis of the moduli space of the three-
dimensional sym theory [7, 11]. the fermions  ( = 1,   , 16) are to represent two
space-time spinors of the same chirality in the iib theory. in fact, after decomposing by the
eigenvalues of 9 as in eq. (6), we put

then fermion part of the lagrangian density takes the form

(22)

(23)

both of + and + are spinors with respect to the manifest symmetry so(7) of the same
eigenvalue (+1) of 9. in the weakly coupled limit gs  1, which means r1  r2, nonzero
modes of 1 energetially decouple, and + and + represent the two 8s spinors in iib
theory. also, in the strongly coupled limit r2  r1, it turns out that + = (+ + +)/2
and + = (+  +)/2 become spinors desired in iib theory3. in this way, we can see that

in both of the two limits related via s-duality chiral spinors are correctly reproduced in the
iib matrix string theory.

3 in iia matrix string theory, by the same replacement (22), we seem to have chiral iib theory, but it is
not correct. the iia matrix string theory has the manifest symmetry so(8). note that + is not a spinor
under the so(8) due to the 8 factor in eq. (22).

3 partition function of four-dimensional n = 4 su (n )

super yang-mills theory

here we calculate the partition function of n = 4 su(n) sym theory on four-torus t 4
by mapping the theory to a cohomological eld theory. the dimensional reduced version of
this argument is used in later computations of the partition function of iia and iib matrix
string theories.

n = 4 su(n) sym theory on a at four-dimensional space-time is given by the following

in this section, we use the notation in ref.
[20]. the vector supereld v represents a
multiplet containing a gauge eld am and a complex two-component gauge fermion , and
the chiral supereld s (s = 1, 2, 3) contains a multiplet of a complex higgs scalar bs and
a higgsino s. all the elds belong to the adjoint representation of su(n), tr denotes
the trace in the fundamental representation. the theory has the internal symmetry group
su(4)i, under which the fermions ( and ss) transform together as 4 and bss as 6. also,
, qv  as 4, 4 respectively, where v (= 1,   , 4) is the su(4)i index and
the supercharges qv

3.1 twisting of n = 4 super yang-mills theory

the twisting procedure, which was rst introduced by witten [21], gives a systematic tool
for constructing a cohomological eld theory from the original physical theory. here we
briey explain a twisting procedure of n = 4 sym theory adopted by vafa and witten [22].
first, we consider a general four-manifold on which the n = 4 sym theory is dened.
the holonomy group of this manifold is so(4) = su(2)l  su(2)r, that is a gauged sym-
metry with the spin connection being the (external) gauge eld. adding the global su(4)i,
we concentrate the symmetry group of the theory

h = su(2)l  su(2)r  su(4)i.

the twisting by vafa and witten is performed as follows. consider the subgroup of the
internal symmetry group su(4)i:

su(4)i  so(4) = su(2)f  su(2)f ,

then replace the action of su(2)l by the diagonal sum su(2)
the twisted symmetry group becomes

l = su(2)l  su(2)f . thus

under h , the supercharges split up as

h  = su(2)

l  su(2)r  su(2)f .

 = ( qi

  qi

qv

qv  = qij   qi ,

where i and j are su(2)f and su(2)f  indices respectively, also j is converted to  by the
twisting. here we have the two scalar supercharges qi (i = 1, 2), which are nilpotent

as seen from the supersymmetry algebra of the original supercharges

{qi, qj} = 0

{qv

(26)

(27)

we can construct a cohomological eld theory based on each qis. the qis are related to
the original supercharges as

q1 = q11
q2 = q21

1 + q12
1 + q22

2 = qv=1
2 = qv=3

=1 + qv=2

(28)

next, in the case of four-dimensional kahler manifolds, the number of the nilpotent
scalar supercharges become doubled as we will see4. a four-dimensional kahler manifold

4this property was explored rst by witten [24] in the case of n = 2 sym theory.

8

l charge, that is, thay all become scalar supercharges, since qi1

has the reduced holonomy group u(1)l  su(2)r, where u(1)l is a certain subgroup of
su(2)l. in this case, twisting is done by replacing the u(1)l by the diagonal sum u(1)
l =
u(1)l  u(1)f . here, u(1)f  is a subgroup of su(2)f . we assign the u(1)l charge +1 to
qv
=1 and 1 to qv
=2, and give a similar assignment of the u(1)f  charge (+1 to the j = 1
index and 1 to the j = 2). then by twisting, the four qv
s in eqs. (28) are to have zero
u(1)
2 = qi
21.
it is clear that they are nilpotent. note that one of the four charges is a (chiral) generator
of the manifest n = 1 supersymmetry in eq. (24). we will use that charge, denoted by q,
to construct a cohomological eld theory in the next subsection.
since the twisting changes the coupling of the elds with the spin connection [23], for
a general four-manifold the twisted theory diers from the original theory. however, on a
manifold with the at metric (t 4) or more generally on a hyper-kahler manifold for which
the twisting is a trivial operation owing to its holonomy group su(2)r, the twisted theory
coincides with the original theory. now we will investigate the t 4 case.

3.2 partition function of n = 4 sym on t 4
the n = 4 su(n) sym theory dened on t 4 can be seen as a cohomological eld theory by
(trivial) twisting, because of the reason mentioned above. in the action sn =4 (24), since q
acts as 
 = r d (up to total derivative terms) for suitable , the term with | are written
in the q-exact form {q,  }. also, the term tr w  w |  is equal to trw w| modulo the
total derivative term trf  f, so it is of the q-exact form. here we consider the periodic
boundary condition case on t 4, or equivalently the sector of zero t hooft discrete magnetic
ux, those total derivative terms can be discarded. the term tr 
2]|  can not be
written as the q-exact form, but it is q-invariant because q is a part of the manifest n = 1
supersymmetric transformation. thus the action can be written as

sn =4 = {q,  } + o(0),

where

o(0) = z d4x

with  being a real parameter. the charge of the component elds can be read o from eqs.
(31) as  2
3, 0, 1, 0 for bs, s, fs, am, , d, respectively. note that the action
has the symmetry under this rotation.
now the problem can be made more tractable by considering the following mass pertur-

using the same argument as above, the rst term is written in the form {q,  }, and
the second term is a q-invariant operator with the u(1)-charge  2
3 denoted by o(2/3). in
cohomological eld theories, the perturbation by the q-exact operators does not alter the
theory, and the partition function is invariant under the perturbation of o(2/3) if the u(1)-
symmetry remains left even in the quantum level. in fact, it is so since there is no anomaly
in n = 4 theory. thus we can obtain the answer by computing the partition function of the
mass perturbed system.
here, it is remarked that the u(1)-symmetry is dierent from the ghost number symmetry
usually used in cohomological eld theories. in fact, it is seen that in the cohomological eld
theory made from n = 4 sym theory the ghost number symmetry corresponds to the
following rotation [22, 25]

1(, , x)  1(ei, ei, x)
2(, , x)  2(ei, ei, x)
3(, , x)  e2i3(ei, ei, x)
w (, , x)  eiw (ei, e , x).

vafa and witten [22] discussed the invariance of the partition function under the mass
perturbation based on this ghost number symmetry. our argument presents another proof
of the invariance.

we should remark that cohomological eld theories have an important feature that the
contribution of the path integration localizes in congurations of the classical vacua. in the
mass perturbed system, the classical vacua are given by the solutions of these equations:

[b1, b2] = mb3,
[b2, b3] = mb1,

(33)

a special property of the perturbation is that three equations in (33) have the form of su(2)
algebra. so, the solution i
m bs is given by the generator of n-dimensional representation of
su(2). at the same time, this solution satises eq. (34) also, because bss are anti-hermitian.
since we must consider the various n-dimensional representations, both of reducible and
irreducible, in general the solution takes the form

i
m

bs =

l(a1)

l(al)

l(a2)

s

(35)

s

where l(a)
is a generator of a-dimensional irreducible representation of su(2), and a1 + a2 +
   + al = n. we remark that all the solutions of the form (35) do not contribute to the
partition function, but only the a1 = a2 =    = al case does. in fact, considering the l = 2
case, it is easy to see that the unbroken gauge group of the solution (35) contains a following
u(1)-generator

" e11a1

0

0

e21a2 # ,

(36)

where e1 and e2 are real parameters satisfying e1a1 + e2a2 = 0. let us consider the a1 6= a2
case. the interactions are all in the form of commutators, so this u(1) mode is free and
massless, which implies that there exists a fermion zero-mode corresponding to the u(1).
thus its contribution to the partition function vanishes. however, when a1 = a2, the bs is
written as

i
m

bs = 12  l(a)
s ,

(37)

where we put a1 = a2  a. then it is noted that the unbroken gauge group is enhanced to
su(2)  za. this mode is not free and thus can give a certain contribution to the partition
function, which amounts to a n = 1 su(2)  za sym theory. for the case of generic l, a
similar argument goes on and it can be seen that the vacuum which can contribute to the
partition function is a n = 1 su(l)  za sym theory with al = n. in the consequence the
partition function of the n = 4 theory is represented as a sum of the partition function of
the various n = 1 theories:

z d=4, n =4

su (n )

(t 4) = xal=n

z d=4, n =1
su (l)za (t 4).

(38)

further, since the za factor in the gauge group su(l)  za implies a summention of the at
za bundle, it yields a factor a41 = a3, where the power 4 comes from summing up the at
bundle for each ams and the (1) from dividing by the gauge group za. thus we have

z d=4, n =4

su (n )

(t 4) = xal=n

a3z d=4, n =1

su (l)

(t 4).

(39)

here we should note that the partition function of the n = 1 theory in the right hand side
is given by its witten index. in the hamiltonian formalism, the partition function is written
as

tr(1)f eh ,

(40)
where the (1)f -factor is included in order to impose the periodic boundary condition on
the fermion elds. recall that there is no higgs eld in the n = 1 theory, which implies
that there exists no continuous zero-mode in the theory on t 4. spectra appearing in the
theory are all discrete. then in eq. (40), the contribution of every supersymmetric pair with
non-zero energy is precisely cancelled, and only the zero-energy states can contribute. so
eq. (40) is independent of , and it coincides with the witten index

i  lim



tr(1)f eh,

whose value of the n = 1 su(l) sym theory is known to be l [26]. plugging the above
formulas, we obtain the answer

4 iia matrix string partition function

here we calculate the partition function of iia matrix string theory and compare the result
of kostov and vanhove [13] which has been derived in the case of the strong coupling limit
g  . we have seen in section 2 that the sym elds in periodic boundary condition can
reproduce the second quantized superstrings with interactions. thus, considering the two-
dimensional sym theory with periodic boundary condition as the iia matrix string theory,
we evaluate the partition function of this theory.

now we have to take care of the u(1) part of the gauge group u(n) before doing the

calculation. we consider the gauge group u(n) in the factorized form

u(n) = u(1)  (su(n)/zn ).

(44)

the meaning of the u(1) part in the iia matrix string theory, whose eld contents are
(a, x, ), is as follows. the u(1) part of x and  represents the center of mass coordinates
of the strings in transverse directions. we x it from the translational invariance. on the
other hand, the u(1) part of a is related to the number of d-particles, so we have to take
into account this. more precisely, as is discussed in [6], the u(1) electric ux corresponds to
the number of d-particles:

q =

1

2 z r

deu (1)  z.

0

(45)

(46)

corresponding to eq. (44), the gauge eld a is decomposed as

a = au (1)

 t u (1) + aa

t a,

where t u (1) = 1
n 1n , and t a (a = 1,   , n 21) is a generator of su(n). since the interaction
in the sym theory appears in the form of commutators, the u(1) gauge part decouples and
thus the partition function of the iia matrix string theory becomes

ziiams =  z dau (1)

vol(u(1))



esu (1)! z d=2, n =8

su (n )/zn

(t 2),

(47)

where the wick rotation was performed. the two-torus, where the sym theory is dened
on, is a rectangular one with the size t  r. the action of the u(1) gauge part is given by

(47) by taking the au (1)
let us evaluate the rst factor in eq.

gauss law constraint means that au (1)
is independent of . also, considering the wilson
loop wrapping around the  direction, we see that ( )  rau (1)
is an angular variable
whose conjugate momentum p is quantized to an integer. employing the variable ( ) and
translating to the hamiltonian form, we can compute the rst factor as

4.1 z d=2, n =8

su (n )/zn (t 2)

now our remaining task is evaluating the second factor of eq. (47), which is performed by
considering the dimensionally reduced version of the analysis in section 35. since the q-exact
structure as well as the q-invariant one is preserved even after the dimensional reduction, the
dimensionally reduced theory of a cohomological eld theory becomes also a cohomological
eld theory. further, the u(1)-symmetry in (31) remains nonanomalous in the dimensional
reduction to two-dimensions in the case of the su(n) gauge group, because it contains no
u(1) factor. thus, the arguments of the mass perturbation in section 3.2 can be applied
also to the dimensionally reduced case. then, the mass perturbation breaks the n = 8
supersymmetry to n = 2, and the partition function takes the form

z d=2, n =8

su (n )

(t 2) = xal=n

z d=2, n =2
su (l)za (t 2).

(49)

5 since in section 3 the supersymmetry algebra (27) has no central charges, here we are to consider the
n = 8 supersymmetry algebra without central charges as the result of the dimensional reduction. in fact,
the central charges are written in the form of total derivatives, so they do not appear under the periodic
boundary condition. in the innite two-dimensional space, central charges exist and represent the topological
charges which characterize stable solitonic modes in the theory. on the contrary, in the two-torus with the
nite size, such solitonic modes do not exist stably. in this case, it can be considered that with respect to
the sector of the zero total charge, dynamical degrees of freedom of the modes are contained in the theory,
i.e.
in the congurations which the path integration is performed over, and that they arise as metastable
states when the sizes of the two-torus becomes large enough. of course, a similar consideration is possible
in the three-torus case in section 5.

13

in two-dimensions, by the argument similar as in the four-dimensional case, the za factor of
the gauge group yields a21 = a. hence we have

z d=2, n =8

su (n )

(t 2) = xal=n

az d=2, n =2

su (l)

(t 2).

(50)

here the n = 2 theory in two dimensions contains higgs elds, whose zero momentum modes
form continuous spectrum beginning with zero-energy because the eld space of the higgs
elds is noncompact. this situation makes ambiguous the relation between the partition
function and the witten index, so we cannot go along the same line as in the four-dimensional
case. however, owing to the fact that n = 2 su(l) sym theory in two dimensions is a
cohomological eld theory, the partition function z d=2, n =2
(t 2) can be evaluated. let us
see it from now.

su (l)

after an appropriate eld redenition (see appendix a), the classical action of the n = 2

sym theory is written as the brst exact form

s = qz d2 tr  1

8g2 [, ]  i + 2g2h +

1

2g2 d ! ,

where the brst transformation is dened by

qa = , q = id, q = 0,
q = h,
q  = ,

qh = [, ],
q = [, ].

(51)

(52)

note that the q is nilpotent up to the gauge transformation with the parameter , which
gives a cohomology to equivalent classes with respect to the gauge transformation. the eld
contents are as follows. a is a two-dimensional gauge eld, and , ,  together stand
for fermions.  and  are complex higgs elds, and h is a bosonic auxiliary eld. ghost
number is assigned as 2 to , 1 to  and , 0 to a and h, +1 to , +2 to . the ghost
number conservation is nonanomalous for the same reason as in the case of the dimensional
reduction of the u(1)-symmetry. the contribution of the path integration of the gauge eld
localizes in the congurations determined by

the addition of a q-exact term to the action does not change the theory, if it behaves well
at innity in the eld space. thus, we may discard the rst term in eq. (51)

  2f12 = 0.

(53)

qz d2 tr

1
8g2 [, ].

(54)

also, it can be seen that the partition function is independent of the coupling g for the same
reason. the localization (53) can be shown by integrating out h and  elds in the g  0
limit after the integrals of  and . then the partition function becomes

da

vol(su(l))dd (dd + {, }) (d) (d12  d21) (f12),

(55)

z

14

which indicates the declared localization. it should be noted that the localization is deter-
mined by the brst xed point q = 0 after using the equation of motion of h. eq. (55)
is not in a suitable form for our purpose, so we will deform the theory judiciously as in the
section 3 in ref. [27].

we consider the action with the addition of the q-exact term

s(t) = s + tqz d2 tr ,

(56)

where s stands for the action s with the term (54) eliminated and t is a parameter. if new
brst xed points that ow in from innity when t turns on do not contribute, the deformed
theory coincides with the original one. after integrating out h, ,  and , we end up with
the action in the large t case

s(t) =

1

2g2t z d2 tr[f12(dd + {, })  id(d12  d21)] + o(t2),

(57)

which can be again written in the q-exact form

s(t) = q" i

2g2t z d2 trf12d + o(t2)# .

(58)

considering the case t = iu with u large real positive, the -integration yields (ddf12).
using the normalizability of f12, it means that the localization realizes at the solutions of
df12 = 0, which contain extra components adding to the localization point of the original
theory f12 = 0. arising of the extra components is a signal of the ow of new brst xed
points from innity. in fact, in the above process, the contribution of the  and  integrals
localizes the points

 =

2t
1
 = 
t

d,

f12 +

1
2t2 (dd + {, }),

which appear rst when t turns on. so they are the new xed points owing in from innity.
thus in general, the deformed cohomological eld theory does not equivalent to the original
one. however, there is a possibility that the brst invariant operators with the following
feature exist  in calculation of their correlators the extra components do not contribute.
if there are such operators, the deformed theory coincides to the original one with respect
to the restricted set of the operators. indeed, we can nd such operators. for the following
brst invariant operators

  z d2 tr (if12 + 12),

() = tr ( polynomial of ),

(59)

15

we consider the unnormalized expectation value in the deformed theory

he()i  z

da

vol(su(l))dd () es(iu)+.

(60)

here due to the e factor, we can take the limit u =  without changing the behavior
of the elds at the innity, and thus the limit does not change the value of (60). further
integrating out  and , we end up with

he()i = z

da

vol(su(l))

 i



f12! (f12),

(61)

now we can manage to compute the partition function z d=2, n =2

where the factor (f12) (with a nite degree of the derivative
) indicates no contributions
of the extra components. therefore, he()i coincides with the unnormalized expectation
value in the original theory which we denote by he()i .
(t 2) = h1i. notice that
 has the ghost number +2, and thus from the ghost number conservation we can show
h1i = hei. this is equal to the  = 1 case of eq. (61), so we nd
(f12),

da

su (l)



f12

z d=2, n =2

su (l)

(t 2) = z

vol(su(l))

which counts the number of the small gauge inequivalent congurations satisfying f12 = 0.
the number is unity, since the two-dimensional su(l) gauge theory has no nontrivial winding
number. in the consequence we have

z d=2, n =2

su (l)

(t 2) = 1.

(63)

it can be conrmed also by doing the concrete calculation, for example, employing the a1 = 0
gauge xing in eq. (62). pluging this into eq.(50) we get the result

z d=2, n =8

su (n )

(t 2) = xal=n

a.

(64)

finally by taking account into the zn factor as in the four dimensional case, the second
factor z d=2, n =8
su (n )/zn

(t 2) of eq. (47) is obtained as

z d=2, n =8
su (n )/zn

4.2 result of iia matrix string partition function

now we can write down the result of the partition function of the iia matrix string theory.
substituting eqs. (48) and (65) into eq. (47), we have

which coincides the result obtained in the strongly coupled limit (g2  ) by kostov and
vanhove [13]. they have conjectured that their result holds irrespectively of the strength
of the coupling, and they called this property exact quasi classics. since our calculation
has been exactly performed without any approximation, it gives a proof of the exact quasi
classics.

recalling the relations (7) and (8), we rewrite the result (66) in variables in string theory

ziiams =

there are two comments in order. first, the second factor in (67) represents a certain
nonperturbative eect, which corresponds to creation and annihilation of d-particle and
anti-d-particle pairs. such phenomena as creation/annihilation of d- and anti-d- objects
cannot be seen in the m(atrix) theory, because in the innite momentum frame anti-d-
particles in the m(atrix) theory are integrated out and do not appear.
it can be seen
rst after compactied to the iia matrix string theory. second, there is no perturbative
correction in the formula (67).
it agrees to nonrenormalization theorems in perturbative
superstring theory by martinec [28], which tells that the 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-point functions of
massless string vertex operators receive no perturbative corrections in at ten-dimensional
backgrounds.

5 iib matrix string partition function

here, we compute the partition function of iib matrix string theory in the ten-dimensional
iib limit, and compare the exact result of the ikkt model by moore-nekrasov-shatashvili
[14]. we consider the three-dimensional sym theory with periodic boundary condition as
the iib matrix string theory for the same reason as in the iia case. with respect to the
gauge group, the u(1) part of the gauge group u(n) = u(1)  (su(n)/zn ) for the eld
contents (a, x, ) corresponds to the center of mass coordinates of the strings in transverse
directions in the ten-dimensional iib limit r1r2   with gs xed, where the u(1) part
of the gauge eld together with that of x become the transverse coordinates. thus we x
the u(1) part of the gauge eld as well as the higgs elds, and consider the partition function
of the three-dimensional n = 8, su(n)/zn sym theory as that of the iib matrix string
theory
(68)

ziibms = z d=3, n =8
su (n )/zn

(t 3).

the three-torus, where the sym theory is dened on, is taken to be rectangular of the size
t  r1  r2, with the euclidean signature. (we performed the wick rotation as in the iia
case.) in this case, we can also use the dimensionally reduced version of the arguments of the
mass perturbation in the four dimensions, due to the following two reasons. one is that the
dimensional reduction of a cohomological eld theory is also a cohomological eld theory.
the other is that in odd dimensions the dimensionally reduced version of the u(1)-symmetry
in eq. (31) is anomaly free.

17

going on along the same line as in the iia case, we have

z d=3, n =8

su (n )

(t 3) = xal=n
= xal=n

z d=3, n =2
su (l)za (t 3)

a2z d=3, n =2

su (l)

(t 3).

(69)

here, there exists a higgs eld in the three-dimensional n = 2 theory. for the same reason
as before, we cannot relate the partition function directly to the witten index. however,
if considering the ten-dimensional iib limit (21) which in fact we are interested in, we can
proceed further. note that in the large volume limit physics becomes independent of the
boundary condition. so we can evaluate z d=3, n =2
(t 3) by adopting a twisted boundary
condition instead of the periodic boundary condition.

su (l)

5.1 n = 2 partition function with a twisted boundary condition
here we consider the three-dimensional n = 2 su(l) sym theory with the twisted boundary
condition

ai(t, 1, 2) = ai(t + t, 1, 2)

= p ai(t, 1 + r1, 2)p 1
= qai(t, 1, 2 + r2)q1,

(70)

where i = 1, 2, we took the a0 = 0 gauge xing, and p and q are su(l) matrices satisfying
p q = qp e2i/l. for example, p and q can be represented as

p = ei l+1

l

q = ei l1

(72)

(71)
supersymmetry requires that the other elds (higgs  and complex fermion ) satisfy the
same boundary condition as eq.
(70). under this boundary condition, zero momentum
modes become trivial

a(0)

i = (0) = (0) = 0,

because the constant traceless hermitian matrices commuting with p and q simultaneously
do not exist except the trivial case (72).

in this situation, spectra appearing in the theory are discrete, and thus the partition
function coincides the witten index. let us consider the witten index. the argument
below is a three-dimensional analogue of wittens consideration in the four-dimensional
case [27]. also, though it is briey reported in [29], we will discuss it in order to make
this paper more self-contained. our problem is now reduced to counting the number of

18

vacua, i.e.
the number of (small) gauge inequivalent classes of the classical zero energy
states. the gauge transformation preserving both of the boundary condition (70) and the
gauge condition a0 = 0 is generated by the time-independent su(l) matrix of the following
boundary condition

u(1, 2) = e2ik1/lp u(1 + r1, 2)p 1
= e2ik2/lqu(1, 2 + r2)q1

(73)

where ki = 0, 1,   , l  1. the classical zero energy state is given by the conguration

ai = i(iu)u 1

with the other elds nil. here, if this u can be continuously deformed to the identity, there
are no nontrivial sectors, and thus the vacuum is unique modulo small gauge transformations.
we will see that it is in fact so. the u can be written by the su(l) matrix u satisfying the
simpler boundary condition

(74)

(75)

u = (q1)k1p k2 u ,

where

u (1, 2) = p u(1 + r1, 2)p 1
= q u (1, 2 + r2)q1.

we consider a topological classication of gauge transformations with the boundary condition
(75). because of 0(su(l)) = 0, by a suitable continuous translation in a group manifold of
su(l), we can always start with u(0, 0) = 1. then, using eq. (75) we see that

u (0, 0) = u (r1, 0) = u (0, r2) = u (r1, r2) = 1,

i.e. us on the vertices of a square with the size r1  r2 in (1, 2)-space are all identity.
from the fact 1(su(l)) = 0, u on the edges of the square can be taken identity by a
continuous deformation. further, using 2(su(l)) = 0, we continuously deform to u = 1
everywhere in the square. using 0(su(l)) = 0 again, by a continuous translation the u in
eq. (74) can be taken identity on the square. thus, it is conrmed that there is no nontrivial
topological vacuum sector. we conclude that the witten index is unity, which leads to

z d=3, n =2

su (l)

(t 3)|twisted b.c. = 1.

(76)

5.2 result of iib matrix string partition function

as discussed before, in the ten-dimensional iib limit we can replace the value of the partition
function z d=3, n =2

(t 3) with that of eq. (76)

su (l)

z d=3, n =2

su (l)

(t 3) = 1.

19

(77)

substituting this into eq. (69), we have

z d=3, n =8

su (n )

(t 3) = xal=n

a2,

and thus the partition function of the iib matrix string theory is obtained as

ziibms = z d=3, n =8
(t 3)
su (n )/zn
1
n 2 z d=3, n =8

=

(t 3)

su (n )
1
a2 ,

= xa|n

(78)

(79)

which is valid in the ten-dimensional iib limit (21). we should remark that the result (79)
coincides the result of the ikkt model [9] by moore, nekrasov and shatashvili [14]. it is
quite nontrivial and might be a signal of the equivalence between the two iib matrix models
arising from the dierent roots  one is a compactication of the bfss m(atrix) theory, and
the other is a matrix regularization of the worldsheet action of type iib superstring in schild
gauge. also, the result (79) has neither perturbative nor nonperturbative correction. with
respect to the former it agrees again with the nonrenormalization theorems in perturbative
superstring theory [28].

6 conclusions

we have considered the iia and iib matrix string theories derived from the m(atrix) theory
via toroidal compactications. we have summarized that string interactions emerge as the
yang-mills instantons and have shown that in the iib matrix string theory the chiral spinors
are correctly reproduced.

as a preparation for computation of the matrix string partition functions, we have calcu-
lated the partition function of four-dimensional sym theory on t 4, by mapping the theory
to a cohomological eld theory. here, considering the mass perturbation (32) has made the
calculation easier. we have shown the invariance of the partition function under the mass
perturbation in a dierent fashion from the argument by vafa and witten [22].

we have exactly computed the partition function of the iia matrix string theory by
mapping the theory into a cohomological eld theory. our result coincides with the result
obtained in the infra-red limit by kostov-vanhove [13], and thus gives a proof of the exact
quasi classics of the theory conjectured by them. the formula for the partition function re-
ceives no perturbative correction, which is in conformity with nonrenormalization theorems
in perturbative superstring theory by martinec [28]. also, there exist some nonperturbative
corrections which come from the u(1) electric ux in the sym theory and which are inter-
preted as creation and annihilation of d-particle and anti-d-particle pairs. such phenomena
have been reported in high energy scattering of strings in ref. [17]. it may be interesting to
deepen the meaning of our result from the line of the high energy scattering.

20

further, we have evaluated the partition function of the iib matrix string theory in the
ten-dimensional iib limit by a similar method as in the iia case. our result receives neither
perturbative and nonperturbative corrections, which with respect to the former agrees with
the nonrenormalization theorems again. also, our result coincides with the exact result of the
partition function of the ikkt model by moore, nekrasov and shatashvili [14]. although
both of the iib matrix string theory and the ikkt model are considered to give type
iib string theory, they have arised from the distinctive origins, and the relation between
them have not been claried yet. thus our result is quite nontrivial, and may suggest
the equivalence of those two models. in the iib matrix string theory, the s-duality is well
understood from a geometry of the two-torus, but the ten-dimensional lorentz symmetry is
not manifest. on the other hand, in the ikkt model side, while there is a manifest lorentz
symmetry, we have not been able to see the s-dual structure. in this situation, it seems to
be an important step to explore the equivalence and to establish the precise correspondence
between them toward constructing the nonperturbative denition which manifestly realizes
both of the lorentz symmetry and the s-dual structure.

note added

while writing up the manuscript, i received the papers [30, 31] which discuss issues close
to this work. in [30] the thermodynamic partition function of the iia matrix string theory
is calculated in the gs  0 limit, and in [31] some thermodynamic properties of the iia and
iib matrix string theories are discussed.

a two-dimensional n = 2 su (l) super yang-mills the-

ory as a cohomological field theory

here we see that the cohomological eld theory (51) is identical to euclidean n = 2 su(l)
sym theory in two dimensions. we perform the wick rotation for four-dimensional n = 1
su(l) sym theory, and then see that its dimensional reduction to two dimensions coincides
with eq. (51).

first, we start with n = 1 su(l) sym theory in minkowskian four-dimensional space-

(80)

where  = t 0, our convention of the metric is  = diag(1, +1, +1, +1), and the
-matrices satisfy

after dening the -matrices as i = i = i0i (i = 1, 2, 3) which satisfy

{, } = 2.

{i, j} = 2ij,

(81)

we perform the wick rotation as 0 = i4. then, we have the following euclidean action
(82)

on the other hand, in eq. (51), integrating out h and reviving the gauge elds as

it can be easily seen that the bosonic part of the action is the dimensional reduction of

 = a3 + ia4,

 = a3  ia4,

also, after dening the spinor in four dimensions as

the fermion part takes the form of the dimensional reduction of

and satisfy eq. (81). thus it shows that the cohomological eld theory (51) coincides with
the dimensional reduction of (82) to two dimensions.
