askold duviryak

classical description of relativistic pointlike particle with intrinsic degrees of freedom such as
isospin or colour is proposed. it is based on the lagrangian of general form dened on the tangent
bundle over a principal bre bundle. it is shown that the dynamics splits into the external dynamics
which describes the interaction of particle with gauge eld in terms of wong equations, and the
internal dynamics which results in a spatial motion of particle via integrals of motion only. a
relevant hamiltonian description is built too.

i. introduction

the subject of this paper is the classical description of a relativistic pointlike particle in nonabelian gauge eld.
the equations of motion of such a particle possessing intrinsic degrees of freedom (isospin or colour) was extracted
from a quantum theory by wong [1] in 1970. since that time various lagrangian and hamiltonian approaches leading
to the wong equations were proposed in literature. some of them involve anti-commuting or spinor variables [2,3]
and thus are closely related to the quantummechanical description. two other approaches [4,5] known to the author
are formulated purely within the classical mechanics. they are very similar and, actually, are based on the same
geometrical treatment of isospin (or coloured) particle dynamics. namely, the conguration space of particle is a
principal bre bundle with the structure group being the gauge group; the interaction of particle with an external
gauge eld is introduced via the connection on this bundle. the only dierence between two approaches consists in
the choice of lagrangian function, in particular, in that whether the lagrangian depends on gauge potentials linearly,
or not.

while the linear lagrangian [4] seems to be the simplest generalization of the one of classical electrodynamics, the
nonlinear lagrangian [5,4] arises naturally within the kaluzaklein theory. nevertheless, both of them lead to the
same wong equations. this fact suggests the questions: do there exist other lagrangian or hamiltonian versions of
isospin particle dynamics, and how (if yes) the choice of lagrangian function inuences this dynamics.

in the present paper, starting from the mentioned above geometrical treatment of the dynamics, and introducing
appropriate kinematical notions (section ii), we construct in section iii the lagrangian which involves an arbitrary
function of liealgebravalued argument. in particular cases this lagrangian reduces to those of refs. [4,5] (section
iv). in general case it generates two types of dynamics, according to what variables are used for the description
of intrinsic degrees of freedom. the external dynamics is described by the wong equations which include gauge
potentials, but the form of which is indierent to the choice of lagrangian. on the contrary, the internal dynamics is
governed by the particular choice of lagrangian function while gauge potentials completely fall out of this dynamics.
this fact becomes more transparent within the framework of the appropriate hamiltonian formalism developed in
section v. in section vi we sum up our results and discuss the perspectives of quantization.

ii. kinematics on a principal fibre bundle

following refs. [4,5] we take for a conguration space of relativistic isospin particle the principal bre bundle p
over minkowski space iim with structure group g and projection  : p  iim (see ref. [6] for these notions). a particle
trajectory  : ir  p;  7 p( )  p is parameterized by evolution parameter  . a state of particle is determined by
(p, p)  tp .
in this paper we are not interested in the global structure of p, and use its local coordinatization: p  p = (x, g ) =
(x, gi),  = 0, 3, i = 1, dim g, where x = (p)  u  iim (u is an open subset of iim), g = (p)  g, and  : p  g

denes the choice of gauge. respectively, p = ( x, g ), where x  txiim and g  t g g. we call (x, x) and ( g , g ) the
space and the intrinsic (local) variables of particle respectively.
let the principal bre bundle p be endowed with a connection dened by 1-form  on p which takes values in lie

algebra g of g. locally it can be represented as follows [6]:

where

 = ad g 1 + g 1d g  g 1() g + g 1d g ,

 = a (x)dx

(1)

(2)

is g-valued 1-form on u  iim, the mapping  pulls it back onto p, and ad denotes the adjoint representation of
g in g. from the physical point of view g-valued functions a (x) are gauge potentials. under a right action of g
dened in p by

r h : p 7 p  r h (x, g ) = (x, g h),

h  g

the connection form transforms via a pull back mapping r

a gauge transformation arises in a geometrical treatment as a bundle automorphism dened by

h and is equivariant, i.e., r
h

 = ad h 1 , h  g.

 h (x) : p 7 p   h (x)(x, g ) = (x, h (x) g ),

h(x)  g.

(4)

it induces the transformation of the connection form dened by the inverse of the pull back mapping (actually, a
], so that the value of the connection form on each vector eld is
push forward mapping),    = [ h 1
gauge-invariant by denition. the transformed form  is also expressed by eqs. (1) and (2), but with new potentials

physically, the gauge transformation is meant as specic change of coordinatization of p which is not observable.

(6)

is dened on base space iim. it is invariant under the poincare group acting in iim. being pulled back by  onto p it
becomes also right- and gauge-invariant, but appears degenerate.

here we suppose that the lie algebra g of structure group g is endowed with non-degenerate ad-invariant metrics
h  ,  i. the example is the killing-cartan metrics in the case of semi-simple group. in terms of this metrics, the
connection form, and the minkowski metrics one can construct a nondegenerate metrics on the bundle p [5],

 =   a2h, i,

(7)

(a is a constant), which is right- and gauge-invariant but not poincare-invariant (the latter is broken by ). in the
case of bundle over a curved base space the minkowski metrics on the right-hand side (r.h.s.) of eq. (7) is replaced
by the riemanian one. in this form the metrics  arises in the kaluza-klein theory [7] which allows to unify the
description of gravitational and yang-mills elds.

in present work we tacitly suppose that the metrics  as well as each of its two components are positively dened,

at least, on some subset of particle trajectories.

iii. lagrangian dynamics of isospin particle

the dynamical description of the relativistic particle with isospin or colour should, at least, satisfy the following

conditions:

i) gauge invariance;
ii) invariance under an arbitrary change of evolution parameter;
iii) poincare invariance provided gauge potentials vanish.

2

these demands can be embodied in the action:

i = z d l(p, p)

with the following lagrangian

l = | x|f (w ),

 x2  p x x = p( p, p), and f : g  ir is an arbitrary function. we note that
where w  ( p)/| x|,
the quantities | x|, ( p), and thus the variable w and the lagrangian (9) are gauge-invariant.
in order to calculate the variation i of the action (8) it is convenient to use, instead of intrinsic velocity g and
variation g , the following variables: v  g g 1 and g  g g 1. they take values in lie algebra g of group g.
then the argument w of f can be presented in the form

| x| 

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

w = ad g 1 (v + a  x)/| x|.
using the formal technique (see ref. [8] for rigorous substantiation)

g 1=  g 1g g 1,
v = ( g g 1) =  g g 1 + g g 1

g  [v , g ],
(ad g 1 v ) = ( g 1 v g ) = g 1v g + g 1 v g + g 1 v g

etc., where [  ,  ] are lie brackets in g and v is an arbitrary g-valued quantity, we obtain the following euler-lagrange
equations:

in contrast to q, it is gauge-invariant. taking into account the identity

which follows from eqs. (16) and (18), and using the equations of motion (13) in the rst term on r.h.s. of eq. (19),

s = ad

we obtain the equation:

then

using (22) and (13) in (12) yields the equations of spatial motion

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

equations (23) together with the equation (13) or (21) of intrinsic motion determine the particle dynamics on a
principal bre bundle.

now we suppose the existence in lie algebra g of non-degenerate metrics h  ,  i. it allows to identify g and g.

in particular, for co-vector q  g we introduce the corresponding vector q  g, such that

then the equations of motion (23) and (13) take the form

q = hq ,  i.

besides, if this metrics is ad-invariant and, thus, it provides the identity

h[a , b ], ci = h[b , c ], ai

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

for arbitrary a , b, c  g, the quantity hq , qi is an integral of motion.
at this stage we have obtained the well-known wong equations (26)(27) which describe the dynamics of a rela-
tivistic particle with mass m and isospin or colour q . despite that we started with the lagrangian (9) of a fairy
general form, this arbitrariness is obscured in the wong equations. the reason resides in denitions of m and q which
are, in general, complicated functions on tp. this feature is better understood by analysing equations (23) and (13)
which are very similar to the wong equations but do not involve the metrics in g. the only role of this metrics is
that it allows us to use the vector q instead of co-vector q for the description of intrinsic degrees of freedom.
in general, the set of eqs. (23) and (13) is of the second order with respect to conguration variables x and g . in
this regard it is quite equivalent to the set of eqs. (23) and (21). on the other hand, the equations (23) and (13) form
a self-contained set in terms of variables x and q. they involve explicitly potentials of external gauge eld, but their
form is indierent to a choice of lagrangian. besides, the equation (13) is of rst order with respect to q. when to
be interested in the complete dynamics on p, it is necessary to add eq. (15) considered as the rst-order equation
with respect to g .

the equation (21) is the closed rst-order equation with respect to w or, if eq. (18) is invertible, with respect to
s. it might be argued that this equation is coupled with the previous set via | x|, but this quantity is not essential.
indeed, by virtue of a parametric invariance of dynamics, | x| can be considered as an arbitrary function of evolution

4

parameter  , for instance, | x| = 1. in contrast to the set (23), (13), the equation (21) is determined by a choice of the
lagrangian, but, in terms of w or s, it does not include gauge potentials.
hence, the dynamics of isospin particle splits into the external dynamics described by the equations (23), (13), and
the internal dynamics determined by the equation (21). the external dynamics is formulated in terms of variables
x and q which are observable: they sense the inuence of gauge eld. the internal dynamics is built in terms of
unobservable w or s. the only coupling of these realizations of dynamics is provided via integrals of motion, namely,
the particle mass m which aects the external dynamics while is conserved by virtue of internal dynamics, and (if
ad-invariant metrics is involved) a common integral

|q|  phq , qi = |s|.

(29)

in the case of semi-simple gauge group the union of external and internal equations of motion restores the complete
dynamics on p.
indeed, having obtained a solution of this set of equations and using eq. (18) considered as an
algebraic relations one can build the corresponding trajectory in the exact (in this case) adjoint representation of g
and, thus, in g itself. in so going we obtain a particle trajectory in p.

in the following examples we show that the general description of isospin particle includes, as particular cases,

results known in the literature. besides, we demonstrate some new features concerning the internal dynamics.

iv. examples

a. linear lagrangian. electrodynamics

the simplest choice of lagrangian (9) leading to non-trivial intrinsic dynamics corresponds to the following function

f (w ):

f (w ) = m + k  w ,

(30)

where m  ir and k  g are constants. up to notation it coincides with the lagrangian proposed by balachandran et
al. in ref. [4]. in this case the isospin q = ad
g 1 k is purely conguration variable (it does not depend on velocities)
and the equation (13) is truly the rst-order euler-lagrange equation. besides, m and s are constants, i.e., m = m,
s = k , thus the internal dynamics completely degenerates.

the lagrangian (9), (30) is linear with respect to gauge potentials a . in the case of one-parametric gauge group

u (1) it reduces to that of electrodynamics. indeed, in this case we have

g = ei,

v = i ,

a  = ia,

choosing k = ie, where e is the charge of electron, one can present the lagrangian in the form:

l = m| x| + ea x + e .

(31)

(32)

the third term on r.h.s. of (32) is a total derivative and thus it can be omitted. hence, intrinsic variables disappear
in this lagrangian, and the latter takes the standard form.

the similar situation occurs when considering an arbitrary abelian gauge group. for such a group each element

g  g can be represented in the form:

g = e = yi

ei e i = yi

g i,

g i g j = g j g i,

(33)

where the basis of lie algebra is chosen as follows: e i = i or 1 for compact or non-compact subgroup, respectively.
i (here the star    denotes the complex conjugation)
taking the identity ad = idg into account and putting k = ki e 
we obtain the lagrangian

l = m| x| + k  a  x + k  

(34)

which depends on intrinsic variables via a total derivative.

5

b. right-invariant lagrangian. kaluza-klein theory

the following choice of the function f (w ):

f (w ) = f (|w|),

where

|w|  phw , wi = |v + a  x|/| x|

and f : ir  ir is an arbitrary function of |w|, corresponds to lagrangian which is invariant under the right action
of g. this is due to the fact that this lagrangian does not depend on g while the variable v itself is right-invariant.
following the noether theorem there exist corresponding integrals of motion. in the present case they form g-valued
co-vector s dened by eq. (18) or, equivalently, g-valued vector
w ,

(37)

s =

f (|w|)
|w|

where f (|w|)  d f /d|w|. we note that the integrals of motion s and m (w ) are not independent.
indeed, if
f (|w|) is not constant, the relation (37) may be solved with respect to w . then the mass m can be presented as a
function of |s| = |q|. otherwise both these quantities are constants. thus the mass m and the isospin module |q|
are completely determined by the external dynamics.
the right-invariant lagrangian of special kind arises naturally in the framework of kaluza-klein theory [7]. it has

the following form [5,4]:

l = mp( p, p),

where the metrics  on a principle bundle p is introduced by eq. (7). in our notations this lagrangian corresponds
to the choice:

f (|w|) = mp1  a2|w|2.
this function determines the following relation between m and |q|:
m (|q|) = pm2 + |q|2/a2.

c. isospin top

(39)

(40)

in the above two examples the internal dynamics does not aect the external dynamics. here we consider a contrary

(35)

(36)

(38)

(41)

(42)

(43)

example.

let

f (w ) = f (),

  phw , t wi,

where t is a self-adjoint (in the metrics h  ,  i) linear operator. in this case we have

and

s =

f ()



t w

m = f ()  f ().

if the relation (43) is invertible, the quantity  turns out to be an integral of motion which is independent of |q|.
taking this fact into account and using the parameterization | x| = 1 one can reduce eq. (21) to the following equation
of internal motion:

t w = [t w , w ].

(44)

this is nothing but the compact form of euler equations (i.e., the equations of motion of a free top) generalized to the
case of arbitrary group [9]. a solution of this equation is necessary for evaluation of the observable mass of particle.
the relation between the external dynamics and the internal one becomes more transparent within the hamiltonian

formalism which we consider in the next section.

v. transition to hamiltonian description

the lagrangian description on the conguration space p enables a natural transition to the hamiltonian formalism
with constraints [10] on the cotangent bundle tp over p. locally, tp  tu  tg and, in turn, tg  g  g.
the latter isomorphism is established by right or left action of group g on tg (see, for instance, [11]). it is implicitly
meant in our notation. namely, we coordinatize tg by variables ( g , q) or ( g , s ).

let us introduce basis vectors e i  g satisfying the lie-bracket relations:

[e i, e j] = ck

ij e k,

(45)

ij are the structure constant of g, and basis co-vectors e i  g such that e j  e i = j

where ck
i . then the standard
symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle tp over the manifold p can be expressed in terms of local coordinates
x, p, gi and qj  q  e j by the following poisson-bracket relations:

{x, p} = 
 ,
(other brackets are equal to zero) where  j
follows:

{qi, qj} = ck

ijqk,

{gi, qj} =  i

j( g )

(46)

i ( g ) are the components of right-invariant vector elds on g dened as

(47)

here e is group unity. equivalently, we can use variables sj  s  e j instead of qj. then the poisson-bracket relations
take the form:

{x, p} = 
 ,

{si, sj} = ck

ijsk,

{gi, sj} = i

j( g ),

where j

i ( g ) are the components of left-invariant vector elds on g,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) h = e

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) h = e

(48)

(49)

(51)

(52)

(53)

once the poisson brackets are dened, we can use in calculations both sets of variables. in particular, taking into
account the relation s = ad

g q we obtain:

{qi, sj} = 0.

(50)

the transition from the lagrangian description to the hamiltonian one lies through the legendre transformation
dened by eqs. (14) and (15) or (18). it is degenerate and leads to the vanishing canonical hamiltonian, due to
parametrical invariance. instead, the dynamics is determined by constraints.

in order to obtain constraints explicitly let us consider the relations (17) and (18). they present, in fact, the
legendre mapping w 7 s and thus allow to consider the mass m as a function of s only. then eq. (14) reduces to

  p  q  a  = m ( s)

x
| x|

which yields immediately the mass-shell constraint:

if the matrix

  2  m 2( s ) = 0.

kijk  (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

2f (w )

wiwj (cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

is non-degenerate, there are no more constraints. otherwise, eq. (18) leads to additional constraints of the following
general structure:

r( s ) = 0,

r = 1,   dim g

(54)

7

which together with the mass-shell constraint (52) form the set of primary constraints. hence, the dirac hamiltonian
is

hd = 0 + rr,

(55)

where 0 and r are lagrange multipliers. it is evident from eqs. (55), (52), (54) and (46), (48), (50) that secondary
constraints (should they exist) are of the same general structure as in eq. (54). at the nal stage of analysis the
mass-shell constraint can be considered as the rst-class one. this is provided as soon the mass squared m 2( s) is
conserved. if it is not, there exists another integral of motion m 2( s ) which is the superposition of m 2( s) and r( s )
and thus it coincides with m 2 on the constraint submanifold of tp. then the rst-class mass-shell constraint has
the form (52) but with the function m 2( s ) instead of m 2( s ).

the total set of constraints is gauge-invariant. this follows from the transformation properties of variables,

x = x,

p

 = p  q (cid:18) h 1(x)

 h (x)

x (cid:19) ,

q  = ad

h 1

q,

(x)

s  = s,

(56)

and gauge potentials (5). in particular, the variables  dened in eq. (51) are gauge-invariant.

at this stage the splitting of particle dynamics into the external and internal ones becomes obvious. indeed, the

hamiltonian equations

d
d

(x, p, q) = {(x, p, q), hd}  0{(x, p, q), 2},

(57)

where  is diracs symbol of weak equality, are closed with respect to variables (x, p, q ). they describe the external
dynamics and can be reduced to the equations (23) and (13) by eliminating the variables p and the multiplier 0.
the equation

s = { s, hd}  0{ s, m 2( s )} + r{ s, r( s )}

(58)

is closed in terms of s . similarly, it can be reduced to the equation (21) of the internal dynamics.

the further treatment of hamiltonian dynamics, i.e., the classication of constrains as rst- and second-class ones
etc., demands a consideration of some specic examples. in particular, in the example a the set of primary constrains
consists of the mass-shell constraint (52) with m ( s) = m which is of the rst class, and

i( s)  si  ki = 0,

i = 1, dim g

(59)

which can be both of the rst and of the second classes depending on the structure of gauge group. in any case
secondary constraints do not appear.

finally we note that the splitting of the isospin particle dynamics into the external and internal one is achieved
as follows. we replace the set of independent variables (say, x, p, gi, qj) by (x, p, qi) and (sj ) which separately
form self-contained subalgebras in terms of poisson brackets. if the gauge group is semi-simple, this replacement
is equivalent. otherwise the group variables gi corresponding to the invariant abelian subgroup are not essential
(similarly to the case of abelian gauge group; see example 4.1). in any case the structure of poisson-bracket relations
(46), (48), (50) and constraints (52), (54) allows to treat all the group variables as redundant unobservable quantities
which falls out of the present formulation of isospin particle dynamics.

vi. conclusions

in this paper we consider the formulation of classical dynamics of the relativistic particle in an external yang-mills
eld. we have deduced the wong equations from the lagrangian of rather general form dened on the tangent bundle
over principle bre bundle. besides, we have shown that this lagrangian leads to some internal particle dynamics
which seems to be unobservable. the only quantities coupling this dynamics with the wong equations are the mass
m and isospin (or colour) module |q|, the intrinsic characteristics of particle. in the present description they are
integrals of internal motion.
the physical treatment of internal dynamics should become better understood within an appropriate quantum-
mechanical description. it can be constructed on the base of hamiltonian particle dynamics proposed in section v.
here we only suggest some features of such a description.

8

following the procedure of canonical quantization one replaces dynamical variables x, p, q , s etc. by operators
x, p, q , s, and poisson brackets by commutators. let us suppose for a simplicity that the matrix kijk is not degener-
ate. then the classical dynamics is determined by the only mass-shell constraint (52). on the quantum level it leads
to the wave equation:

which determines physical states of the system. since the operators | q|2, |s|2, and m 2(s ) mutually commute, one
can choose the representation in which they are diagonal:

(cid:16) 2  m 2(s )(cid:17)  = 0

(60)

| q|2qln = |s|2qln = q2qln,

m 2(s )qln = m 2

qnqln.

(61)
(62)

here the quantum numbers l and n label states of proper subspaces of the operators | q|2 and |s|2 respectively, and
the quantum analogue of the equality (29) is taken into account. then eq. (60) takes the form of the mass-shell
equation,

(cid:16) 2  m 2

qn(cid:17) qln = 0,

(63)

for the relativistic particle with the isospin or colour q and the rest mass mqn. if the dynamics is not right-invariant,
the quantum number n distinguishes states with dierent rest masses. thus it is tempting to relate n with a avour or
generation. of course, this supposition is by no means substantiated and needs a following elaboration. in particular,
the spin of particle must be taken into account. on the other hand, the arbitrariness of lagrangian (9) should be
reduced within some profounder theory. the present reminiscence may outline the way leading to such a theory,
or, at least, it may suggest a phenomenological quantum description of relativistic particles with intrinsic degrees of
freedom type of isospin, colour, avour etc.
