abstract

in this short note we review the construction and role of wess-zumino
couplings of dirichlet branes and orientifold planes, and show how these
combine to give the green-schwarz anomaly cancelling terms.

the low energy eective theory of a d-brane has two types of cou-
plings, the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) and wess-zumino (wz) terms. the
former describes the coupling of the vector potential and scalars coupling
to the nsns elds, while the latter gives the coupling of the vector
potential and the pullback of the curvature elds to the rr potentials.
the rst d-brane wz term [1] simply states that a dp-brane is charged
under c (p+1), the p + 1-form rr potential

sd

w z = pzbp

c (p+1) ,

(1.1)

where p is the charge density of a d-brane and bp its worldvolume. it
was then shown that d-branes couple to lower dimensional rr poten-
tials [2] and that a brane within brane picture emerged

sd

w z = pzbp

c tr exp(if/2) .

(1.2)

in the above c represents a formal sum of rr potentials, f = f  b,
f is the worldvolume gauge eld and b the nsns two form.1

an r4 term found in [3] required, as a consequence of duality, the
presence of a gravitational wz coupling [4]. later the entire wz action

1f , rather than f , is present in the action as the latter quantity is not gauge invariant.

was found using the anomaly inow mechanism [5, 6] and reads

a(rn )

,

(1.3)

where a is the dirac or a-roof genus and rt , rn are the pull-backs of
the tangent and normal bundle curvatures to the d-brane world-volume,
respectively.

this coupling has a natural interpretation within k-theory [7]. in k-
theory there is a natural bilinear pairing of bundles given by the index
of the dirac operator on the tensor product of the two bundles. for e
a bundle over a manifold x, with t x the tangent space of x, the map

e  ch(e)q a(t x) ,

(1.4)

is an isometry with respect to this pairing and the derham pairing in
h (x), the cohomology of x. in fact,following [13], it was shown [14]
that d-brane charges are indeed classied by k-theory.

the d-brane wz couplings were conrmed by string amplitude cal-
culations. in [9] the four-form couplings were computed at tree level.
a one-loop amplitude in [10] and tree-level amplitude in [11] conrmed
the presence of all the couplings, while in [12] extra, non-anomalous
couplings, as well as the normal bundle contributions were determined.
in [8], it was rst observed that o-planes too carry gravitational wz
couplings. for consider type i theory, in which 16 d9-branes, their
images and an o9-plane, ll the spacetime. the wz coupling of the
theory is the green-schwarz (gs) coupling [15]. this diers from the
wz couplings of 32 d9-branes, indicating that o9-planes too have wz
couplings. by studying one-loop [10], and tree-level [11] scattering am-
plitudes it was found that the wz coupling of op-planes is

so

w z = 2p4pzbp

c s l(rt /4)

l(rn /4)

,

(1.5)

where l is the hirzebruch polynomial. to see that the o9-plane and
d9-brane wz couplings match the gs term consider the following. the
massless chiral elds of type i string theory are a neutral gravitino, a
neutral fermion of opposite chirality and so(32) fermions. the total
anomaly for this theory follows by descent from2

(1.8)

since h = dc (2) + . . . is gauge invariant and dc (6) =  dc (2) the gauge
transformation for c (2) is

c (2) = 492

hence (1.8) has an anomalous variation which follows by descent from

the type i charge density satises

and hence iw z = i as required.

o-planes cannot couple to gauge elds so their wz couplings have to
be purely gravitational. hence it is a consistency check for the d9-brane
and gs gauge and mixed couplings to agree.
