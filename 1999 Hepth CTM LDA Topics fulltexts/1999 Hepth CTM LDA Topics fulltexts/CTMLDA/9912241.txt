however, long string picture n4 points within interval size 1/n1 long string world-sheet. hence large n1 limit open hole everywhere world-sheet, summing opening (which summing dierent ways exciting impurities) corresponds summing moduli holes world-sheet. hence, open string perturbation theory, i.e., expansion number holes world-sheet expansion total number excited impurities. transition branch
