abstract

a general calculation of casimir energies in an arbitrary number of dimensions for
massless quantized elds in spherically symmetric cavities is carried out. all the most com-
mon situations, including scalar and spinor elds, the electromagnetic eld, and various
boundary conditions are treated with the uppermost accuracy. the nal results are given as
analytical, closed expressions in terms of barnes zeta functions. a direct numerical evalua-
tion of the formulas is then performed, which yields highly accurate numbers of, in principle,
arbitrarily good precision.

introduction

calculations of casimir energies in spherically symmetric situations have attracted the interest
of physicists for well over thirty years now. since the calculation of boyer [1], who computed the
casimir energy for a conducting spherical shell and found, to his surprise, a repulsive force, many
dierent situations in the spherically symmetric context have been considered. for example,
dielectrics were included [2] (for the case of plane, parallel surfaces see [3]) and used later
for possible explanations of sonoluminescence [4] [8]. moreover, enormous interest has been
attracted by the mit bag model in qcd [9] [20] and, also, the inuence of dierent boundary
conditions has been considered in detail [21, 22, 23].

dierent methods have been used for dealing with the casimir eect. whereas in the earlier
times the green function formalism was preferred, in recent years dierent approaches which
make use of contour integral representations of the involved spectral sums are commonplace.
although the idea for this method, in the specic context of casimir energies, goes back to the
early days of the subject [24], a systematical, eective and simple application of this approach
in various contexts has only recently been achieved [21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28].

the spectral sum which actually appears in the calculation depends on the regularisation
used and may include a cuto function, to dampen high frequency contributions [28] or, as in
the zeta regularisation technique [29], complex powers of the eigenvalues [21, 22, 26, 30]. as a
result, the details of the computation may dier slightly, e.g., in the specic integration contour
chosen, but all of them share the elegance of this method.

in recent contributions we have further developed the zeta function technique, in combination
with several contour integral representations. given the deep connections among zeta functions,
heat kernels and functional determinants [31] [34], one advantage of the method is that it can be
applied, alternatively, to the calculation of heat kernel coecients [26], functional determinants
[27, 30] (see also [35, 36]), as well as casimir energies [20] [22]. this clearly shows that zeta
functions serve as a unied framework in dierent areas of interest.

here we want to pursue this idea, by using the zeta function framework in a precise analysis
of the casimir energy as a function of the dimension of space. previously it had been shown, that
arbitrary space dimension can be treated elegantly by making use of barnes zeta functions, where
the dimension can be considered as a parameter [27, 37]. this has been applied to the calculation
of heat-kernel coecients and determinants and it will be here used to study the casimir energy.
apart from dealing with arbitrary dimensions, we will introduce scalars, spinor elds and the
electromagnetic eld in a unied way, including the eects dierent sets of boundary conditions
have on them. in spirit, our analysis is to be compared with the one of ambjrn and wolfram
in ref. [38], with the dierence that the role of the epstein zeta function there is here played by
the barnes zeta function. for a recent analysis on the dimensional dependence of the casimir
energy for scalar elds with dirichlet boundary conditions and the electromagnetic eld in the
presence of a spherical shell see [39, 40], where the space dimension d has been dealt with as a
parameter, and results for (in principle) all values of real d have been obtained.

the article is organized as follows.

in the next section we briey recall the denition of
casimir energies in terms of zeta functions. in sect. 3, we shortly describe the method and
derive the formulas that are subsequently needed in the context of casimir energy calculations
[26, 27]. in sect. 4 we consider the case of a scalar eld. for dirichlet boundary conditions,
the energy in dimensions d = 2 up to d = 9 is given there. the interior and the exterior
regions are treated separately. afterwards, the changes in the procedure needed for robin
boundary conditions are explained, and the corresponding formulas are derived. given that
the casimir energy of the electromagnetic eld is determined by using the casimir energy of
a scalar eld satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions (te modes) and a scalar eld satisfying
robin boundary conditions (tm modes), these forms constitute the basis for the electromagnetic

2

case, and nothing else needs to be calculated, as will be later described in detail (sect. 6). before
that, sect. 5 is devoted to the spinor eld. local bag boundary conditions, as well as global
spectral boundary conditions, are considered. in the concluding section, sect. 7, a summary of
our main results, as well as details on how our method is indeed able to yield arbitrary accurate
results, are given.

2 the casimir energy

the casimir energy of a quantum eld (t, ~x) inside a spherical shell is formally given by

(we set h = c = 1) with the one-particle energies k = k being obtained from

ecas =

k,

1

2xk

 k(~x) = kk(~x),

(2.1)

(2.2)

fullling also suitable boundary conditions. the eld operator is, in our case, a = 2
t  ,
and we have (t, ~x) = eit(~x). the laplacian  is the one dened inside or outside the
d = (d + 1)-dimensional ball bd = {~x  ird| k~xk  r} and the elds (~x) must satisfy
appropriate boundary conditions at k~xk = r.
the casimir energy as given by the formal expression (2.1) is ill dened and has to be
regularised. in the -function regularisation procedure, one writes

ecas =

1
2

2s(s  1/2)|s=0 ,

(s) = xk6=0

s
k

.

(2.3)

(2.4)

here,  is an arbitrary parameter with dimensions of mass to yield the correct dimension for
all values of s, and (s) is the -function corresponding to the operator a. in some cases, ecas
will be divergent and, as is known and will be seen later on, renormalisation ambiguities may
remain.

in order to calculate ecas according to the previous denition, we need information on the
zeta function (s) in a neighborhood of s = 1/2. as we are dealing with operators in at
space, but satisfying boundary conditions on a d-dimensional sphere (d = d  1, the boundary
of the d-dimensional ball), the eigenvalues will be implicitly given as the zeros of a polynomial
p ( z , z 
) involving bessel or hankel functions, according to whether one is considering the
internal or the external domain, respectively. we will denote the associated zeta functions by
 int(s) and  ext(s). the total casimir energy will be the sum of the two terms, that is

ecas =

1
2

2sh int(s  1/2) +  ext(s  1/2)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

.

(2.5)

with just a few modications, which involve the phase of the zeta function (see [41] for precise
details), all the considerations above can be extended to the dirac operator. the basic construct
turns out to be the zeta function of the square of the dirac operator and one encounters a minus
sign in eq. (2.3).

3

3 the method

the method to be used here has been developed in the seminal papers [26, 21, 27] and permits
to compute the -function starting from the (indirect) knowledge of the eigenvalues through an
implicit relation of the kind

p ( zl(nlr), z 

l(nlr)) = 0 ,

nl = 2

nl ,

(3.1)

where n, l  0 are the principal and azimuthal quantum numbers respectively. the degeneracy
d(l) of the eigenvalues and the index l of the bessel functions depend on l and on the dimension.
their explicit forms are strictly related to the elds and the boundary conditions.

the -function can be expressed as an integral in the complex plane, that is

(s) =xl

d(l)

2i z

k2s 
k

ln kbl p ( zl(k), z 

l(k)) dk ,

re s >

d
2

,

(3.2)

where the open contour  has to be chosen to run counterclockwise and to enclose all strictly
positive solutions of eq. (3.1). the additional factor kbl has been inserted in order to cancel
the pole at the origin, which is important when deforming the contour in the next step.
in
this way  can also include the origin. here b is a number which depends on the asymptotic
behaviour of p at the origin: in our cases it will be 1 for scalars, but for spin 1/2 with mixed
boundary conditions it turns out to be 2.
for explicit calculation, it is convenient to write eq. (3.2) as an integral on the real axis. this
can be done by deforming the contour  to the imaginary axis and by making the substitution
k  iy. in general one has to be careful when deforming the contour in that no poles in the
plane re k  0 are hit. in fact, for robin boundary conditions one has

p ( z, z 

 ) =  z(k) + k z 

 (k) = (  ) z(k) + k z1(k) = 0 ,

(3.3)

which may have solutions for k / ir too, if  > . to avoid these cases, in the following we will
consider   0 only, 0 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue.

with this assumption we can write the -function in the more simple form

(s) =

sin s



d(l)z 

0

xl=0

y2s 
y

ln[yblp (l, y)] dy ,

(3.4)

which is valid for 1/2 < re s < 1 (for details see [26]). here, p (, y) = p (z(y), z 
 (y)) is
a polynomial like p (aside, possibly, from an irrelevant sign) and the z(y) = z(iy) are the
modied bessel functions corresponding to z. in order to compute the casimir energy we need
the -function at s = 1/2 and so we have to do an analytic continuation of eq. (3.4).
for large values of , we have [42]

with this aim, let us now employ the asymptotic expansion of the modied bessel functions.

(3.11)

as we shall see explicitly in the following, the above behaviour of bessel functions permits

us to write

ln p (, z)  ln f (, z) +

nxn=1

dn(t)

n

,

(3.12)

an expression which is valid for large values of . the function f is related to the exponential
factors in eqs. (3.5)-(3.8), while the coecients dn(t) are related to k and are polynomials in
t. more precisely

dn(t) =

2nxk=0

xnktn+k .

(3.13)

note that when b = 1, all xnk with odd k vanish. of course, f , dn and xnk depend on the
specic problem under consideration. we will specialize them for every case.
the trick consists now in subtracting the asymptotic behaviour from the integrand function

and in integrating the asymptotic part, with arbitrary s, exactly. we thus get

(s) = z0(s) + z(s) +

an(s).

(3.14)

here,

z0(s) = (d  2) d[0]

sin(s)



ln p (0, z)

(3.15)

is the contribution due to l = 0, which is present only in two-dimensions and has to be treated
specically for any case. z(s) represents all the other terms with the asymptotic contributions

(3.19)

eq. (3.16) is convergent for (d  2  n )/2 < re s < 1, thus for our aim it is sucient to
subtract n = d asymptotic terms. this means that with n = d we can directly put s = 1/2
in eq. (3.16) and perform the integral numerically.
as we shall see in the explicit examples, the base -function, n , can be conveniently ex-

pressed in terms of the barnes zeta function [44], dened as [45]

b(s, a; d) =

en(d) =

x~m=0

1

(a + m1 + ... + md)s =

(d + n  1)!
n!(d  1)!

,

en(d)(a + n)s ,

xn=0

for re s > d. obviously, there is an expansion of the kind

en(d) =

d1x=0

g(d)(a + n)

and this yields the expansion of the barnes zeta function in terms of hurwitz zeta functions
[45, 46]

b(s, a; d) =

d1x=0

g(d)h (s  , a).

(3.20)

for example, for d = 2, we trivially get

b(s, a; 2) = h(s  1, a) + (1  a)h(s, a).

one can show that the g(d) are connected with the generalised bernoulli polynomials [47]. this
allows to determine, in a direct way, the residues and nite parts of the barnes zeta function of
the problem at hand. as a result, the asymptotic contributions in (3.14) are readily computed.

4 the scalar eld

the eld equation for this case reads

 k(~x) = kk(~x),

(4.1)

and has to be supplemented with dirichlet or robin boundary conditions. here,  is the
laplace operator inside or outside the d = (d + 1)-dimensional ball and we impose dirichlet
((~x)||~x|=r = 0) or robin ([(~x)| + (~x)]||~x|=r = 0) boundary conditions.

in polar coordinates the solutions are

l,m,n(r, ) = r1d/2f1(l,nr)yl+d/2()

with l = l + (d  2)/2, the f(r) being bessel functions and the yl+d/2() hyperspherical
harmonics [43].

4.1 scalar eld with dirichlet boundary conditions inside a spherical shell

in this case, the f are bessel functions of the rst kind and thus the eigenvalues l,n = 2

l,n are

the -function for the present situation is obtained by means of eqs. (3.13)-(3.17) with the
denitions above.

as already anticipated in the previous section, in two dimension we have an aditional con-

tribution that has to be computed explicitly. with this aim, we recall that, for large z,

i0(z) =

in two dimensions we have to consider also the contribution due to  = 0, which can be

the numerical results for spin 1/2 with bag boundary conditions are given in table 3. the

d = 3 result is the one found already by milton [15] (albeit with far less precision).

5.3 spinor eld with global spectral boundary conditions

we shall now obtain the results for spectral boundary conditions [48, 37]. such boundary
conditions are imposed by setting equal to zero, at r = 1, the negative (resp. positive) z-modes
of the positive (resp. negative) chirality parts of , the rest of the modes remaining free.

roughly speaking, spectral conditions amount to requiring that zero-modes of (5.1) should
be square-integrable on the elongated manifold obtained from the ball by extending the narrow
collar (of the approximate product metric dr2 + d2) just inside the surface, to values of r
ranging from 1 to . this will be so if the modes of a = raa with negative eigenvalues are
suppressed at the boundary (e.g. [53] -[61]).

from (5.4) and (5.3), the boundary operator is a0 = raa|r=1 and has for eigenstates

a0  z (n)

 ! = n  z (n)

 ! , a0  z (n)


z (n)

+ ! = n  z (n)

(5.9)

thus, from (5.2) we see that the negative modes of a0 are associated with the radial factor
jn+d/21(kr). taking  as before,  = n + (d  2)/2, the implicit eigenvalue equation reads

j(k) = 0.

the degeneracy for each eigenvalue is

the relevant boundary zeta function reads now

d(n) = 4 , for d = 2 .

n (s) = 2dsb(2s, d/2  1; d) ,

n (s) = 4r(2s) , for d = 2 .

(5.11)

as we see, apart from the degeneracy of the eigenvalues and the relation between n and the
barnes -function, the rest of the argumentation is identical to that for the scalar case with
dirichlet boundary conditions. thus, eqs. (4.3)-(4.7) remain valid once the above denitions
are used.

for the exterior space we have to employ eqs. (5.10) and (5.11) in eqs. (4.11)-(4.16), but
it has to be noted that here, in contrast with the interior case, l = l + d/2, as a result of the
normal vector changing its sign. this means that there is no l = 0 contribution.

the numerical results for this case are listed in table 4, for d = 2, ..., 9.

6 electromagnetic eld in a perfectly conducting spherical shell

the casimir energy of the electromagnetic eld is, essentially, the sum of a dirichlet and of a
robin scalar eld (with a specic value for , see eq. (4.17)), the only dierence being that the
angular momentum l = 0 is to be omitted. an exception is d = 2, where the vector casimir
eect consists of only the transverse magnetic mode contributions. being precise, in the interior
of the shell one has for the transverse electric (te) respectively for the transverse magnetic
(tm) modes the following boundary conditions [1, 62],

r1d/2jl(l,nr)|r=r = 0,

for te-modes,
for tm-modes.

(6.1)

h(d/2  1)jl(l,nr) + l,nj 

l(l,nr)i|r=r = 0,

the condition for the tm-modes is of robin type with  = 2  d. since the l = 0 mode has
to be omitted, the minimum eigenvalue in this case is 1 = d/2 and therefore we can apply
the method for any  = 2  d > 1  d. thus, in order to get the casimir energy of the
electromagnetic eld, we must simply repeat the computation of sect. 4 for dirichlet and robin

7 discussion and conclusions

in ref. [26], two of the present authors developed a new, seminal approach for nding represen-
tations of the zeta function associated with the laplace operator on the d-dimensional ball. at
that stage, dimension by dimension was considered, but soon a rened and generalised technique
was provided in subsequent works [27, 37]. making use of the barnes zeta function [45], dimen-
sion can easily be dealt with as a parameter and several dierent elds can also be treated on
the same footing. the representations derived are valid for all values of the complex parameter
s and it is up to the practitioners needs or wishes at which values of s the zeta function is to be
evaluated. in previous work our concern was of a more mathematical nature and we considered
function values and residues appropriate to nd heat-kernel coecients [26, 27, 37], as well as
the derivative at s = 0 [30]. since then, a number of proclaimed new methods have been
developed in the literature.

our aim in the present article has been to show explicitly that casimir energies for the
big family of the more usual congurations can be obtained in fact from general formulas, also
in quite non-trivial situations, where the boundaries are not at plates, the elds are spinorial
(rather than scalar), and also when the boundary conditions are very general and rather involved.
we have gone much beyond previous work in that we are not here restricted any more to a very
specic eld in a specic dimension with a specic boundary condition, but give general formulas
for basically any possible situation that can arise in practice, involving spherically symmetric
boundaries.

some comments on the precision and accuracy of the numerical procedure employed are in
order. it is clear from the analysis developed in the previous sections, that a numerical evaluation
of the asymptotic terms ai(s) to any desired accuracy is immediate, using the formulas given
there. these contributions are always represented by known special functions and using available
programs, such as mathematica, the accuracy with which these are calculated is readily obtained.
imposing accuracies of, e.g., 1020 or more, we get results in negligible cpu time.

15

the only problem (if at all) with the numerical analysis is the computation of z(s), eq. (3.14).
it is twofold. on one hand, the integration, up to innity, of the combination of bessel functions
is not strictly possible, using the exact form of the bessel functions. on the other hand, the
angular summation, up to innity, cannot be performed exactly. for large angular momenta, the
bessel functions take a rather complicated form, what renders exact summation not possible. for
that reason, the following procedure has been applied throughout (the error bounds given below
are for dirichlet boundary conditions, but very similar relations hold for the other conditions
considered).

we have dealt with the innite integration as follows. the main contributions always come

from small values of z, and thus we split the integral into

z b

0

dz +z 

b

dz.

whereas in the rst integral the bessel functions themselves are used for the integration, in the
second integral their asymptotic expansion for large arguments is employed. the value of b is
computed with the help of an adaptative procedure, such that the integrand and its asymptotic
expansion dier, at b, by less than, say 1012. typically b = 10 is already sucient. given that
the asymptotics of the bessel functions is a simple polynomial in powers of (1/z), the integration
up to innity is very easily done.

let us now assume that the contribution of the rst l angular momenta has been calculated
as described. in order to get a numerical approximation for the angular momentum sum, from
l + 1 to innity, we proceed as follows. the idea is that, for suciently large values of l,
the integrand can be replaced by its uniform asymptotic expression. for dirichlet boundary
conditions this amounts to going through the following steps:

z int
l+1

2(1 + z2)1/4

= 

d(l)n!
d(l)n 1! + ...# .
lxl=0

(7.1)

again, the integrals over the uniform asymptotics are simple and can be performed analytically.
in this way, a closed expression for the approximation is found, the value of l being again
determined by an adaptative procedure. by denition, the dierence z int
l+1 equals the
contribution coming from l = l. the value of l is determined such that the dierence z int
l 
l+1, obtained from (7.1), agrees up to say 1010 with the contribution from l = l calculated
z int
previously. depending on the dimension, the values of l range from 6 (for d=9) to 49 (for
d=3).

l  z int

in summary, as explained, this procedure takes fully into account the integrals of innite
range as well as the summation up to innity. the error bounds can thus be imposed at will in
the single steps and this guarantees that the results given are always numerically precise, up to
any pre-established digit. to our knowledge, this does not apply to any other method.

16

in the cases when partial results were known, we have compared our numbers with those
while improving always, by several digits, such known values and deriving, for the rst time,
a lot of new ones, for dierent elds (e.g.
results for the exterior space in the case of the
electromagnetic eld) and dierent boundary conditions (e.g. for spectral boundary conditions,
and for bag boundary conditions in any dimension). for the scalar eld with dirichlet boundary
conditions we have re-obtained, in particular, the known result that for d even the energy is
divergent [39]. here it still remains unclear if there may be a natural way to get, unambiguously,
a nite answer with physical sense for this case. in odd dimension, d = 2n  1, the sign of the
casimir energy seems to be determined by the sign of (1)n. for even dimension, d = 2n, one
also nds the alternating structure (1)n+1 for the nite part of the casimir energy; however,
its interpretation is unclear due to the presence of the pole. similar comments hold for the
interior and exterior contributions separately, with the same problems of interpretation. for
neumann boundary conditions, in all the dimensions calculated, the casimir energy is negative.
similarly, one can describe the results summarized in tables 35. in all cases we have been able
to obtain general, highly accurate expressions which, by xing some parameters, provide us with
the desired specic example and yield a numerical answer of arbitrary precision (just by adding
the convenient number of terms of the corresponding series).

disappointing as the mentioned quite well known ambiguities may be (specialists in the
eld are quite used to them by now), even more so is the fact that no general pattern seems
to arise from our general formulas which might hint towards the physical understanding of the
nal sign of the energy. here we have been able to demonstrate, without reasonable doubt, the
existence of the two classes of casimir force: attractive and repulsive, but are unable to give the
rule according to which one or the other will show up at a particular instance. further insight
will be needed to clarify this point.
