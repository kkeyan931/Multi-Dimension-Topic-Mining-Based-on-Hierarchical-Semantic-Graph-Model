we study stringy uctuations as a source for corrections to the wilson loop as obtained
from the superstring on ads5  s5/n = 4 sym correspondence. we give a formal expres-
sion in terms of determinants of two-dimensional operators for the leading order correction.

1. introduction

the remarkable duality between type iib string theory on ads5m5, (m5 a compact
manifold), and conformally invariant supersymmetric yang-mills theory at the boundary

of the anti-de sitter space, proposed in [1] (and elaborated in [2][3]), provides a new

approach to the large n limit of four-dimensional gauge theories. many aspects of this

non-trivial relation have been and indeed still are, the subject of numerous investigations.

an example, that will be further studied in this letter, is the computation of the potential

between a heavy quark-antiquark pair[4][5]. in gauge theory this is conveniently done by

evaluating the expectation value of the wilson loop operator. in the ads/cft scheme,

one considers a string worldsheet with boundary xed at the loop one is interested in.

the (exponential of the) type iib string action with this boundary condition is then the

expectation value of the wilson loop operator.

in refs.[4][5], the authors considered the case m5 = s5 leading to the maximally
supersymmetric n = 4 yang-mills theory. the expectation value of the wilson loop
was calculated to the lowest order by evaluating the area of the string worldsheet. a

macroscopic string is stretched between the quark and antiquark at the boundary of the

anti-de sitter space. the non-trivial metric of this space means that it is energetically

favourable for the string to fall in the interior of the ads space along a geodesic connecting

the two points on the boundary. the string action is the area of the worldsheet in the

induced metric.

the full superstring action in the background ads5  s5 has meanwhile been con-
structed in [6], and further considered in [7]. this enables one to address the question of

stringy corrections to the classical area of the worldsheet. in this letter we will consider

the sigma model corrections at one loop by expanding the string action to quadratic order

in uctuation. we rst recapitulate briey the set up and calculation in [4][5]. we then

start with the superstring action in [6] and expand it around the classical background using

the normal coordinates[8]. the issue of gauge xing to actually evaluate the determinant

is discussed next. we nally give the result in terms of determinants of two-dimensional

second order dierential operators and discuss the issue of uv divergences.

2. wilson loop in ads/cft correspondence

let us consider a static conguration of a quark-antiquark pair separated by a distance

l. the wilson loop is a rectangular one the sides of which are parallel to the time and

one of the space directions. the length of the temporal side t is taken to innity. in the

dual string description there is a macroscopic string with endpoints xed on the quarks

by dirichlet boundary condition. if, for simplicity we assume that the string ends are at
the same point on s5, the minimum energy conguration is that for which the string is

stretched along a geodesic in ads5. this follows from the fact that the classical string
action (with the overall factor  set to 1) is

sng =

1

2 z d2q det||gm n ixm jxn||,

where the gm n is the metric on ads5  s5 given by

ds2 = r2(cid:20)u2(cid:0)(dx0)2 + (dx1)2 + (dx2)2 + (dx3)2(cid:1) +

du2
5(cid:21) .
u2 + d2

(1)

(2)

the spaces ads5 and s5 have the same value of radius (4gn )1/4. note that we have
rescaled u  r2u compared to [4] to make the sigma model loop counting parameter
r2/ manifest.

it is convenient to adopt a static gauge to describe the macroscopic string. let
x m denote the classical values of the string coordinates. we set x 0 =  , x 1 =  and

assume that all the other coordinates except u = u () are independent of the worldsheet

coordinates (, ). the radial coordinate u has a nontrivial dependence on  only, which

is implicitly given by[4]

u = 

u 2
u 2

0qu 4  u 4

0

(3)

with a constant u0 = (2)3/2/(1/4)2l. (u0 is the closest the string comes to the origin
of the ads5 space, and once again we have rescaled it by r2.) due to the symmetry of the
string conguration it will be sucient to restrict to the range 0    l/2 and take the
postive root in (3).

with this choice of classical solution, the metric induced on the worldsheet hcl

ij is given

by

ds2
r2 = u 2 d 2 +
cl

u 6
u 4
0

d2.

(4)

the energy of the quark pair is calculated by evaluating the area ar of the string worldsheet

using this induced metric, and is (after subtracting an innite contribution of the quark

mass[4])

e = 

y m n

42p2g2

(1/4)4l

,

(5)

that is of the form of coulomb law. the 1/l dependence of the energy is a consequence
of conformal invariance, but the g2

y m n = gn , is non-perturbative from the point of view

of the gauge theory.

how is this result calculated in classical string theory, corrected? one possible source

of correction from the change in geometry has been ruled out by a number of authors[9][6][7]
who argued that the ads5  s5 is an exact string background1. however, corrections can
arise from taking into account the uctuation of the string around the given classical

conguration. for this we will need to start with the type iib superstring action in the
ads5  s5 background. let us briey sketch our approach before we go into the details.
we are going to replace the classical saddle-point approximation of [4] by a functional

integral over the uctuations

w (c) =z [dx][d] esi ib (x+x,),

(6)

where x,  denote quantum uctuations of the bosonic and fermionic coordinates. it
was observed in [6] is that the string action on ads5  s5 with radii r is r2 times the
action on ads5  s5 with unit radii. therefore as expected 1/r2 plays the role of a loop
expansion parameter. the superstring action of [6] in this background is a green-schwarz

type action and is invariant under worldsheet dieomorphism and a local fermionic kappa

symmetry. further there is no supersymmetry on the worldsheet. however we will nd

that, much as in the case of at space, a gauge xing condition for kappa symmetry makes

worldsheet fermions out of the fermionic coordinates of the target space.

3. superstring action in ads5  s5 background

in ref.[6], metsaev and tseytlin have constructed an action for the iib theory in the
ads5  s5 background. the action is dened as a covariant -symmetric two-dimensional

1 this is no longer true for gauge theory at nite temperature[10][11].

sigma model on a supercoset appropriate for this background. explicitly, the part of the

lagrangian relevant to us here is

i  ii  a(di)i(cid:1)(cid:0)ea

j  ij  a(dj)j(cid:1)

i (cid:0)1 a(dj)1  2 a(dj)2(cid:1) ,

ix, ea

i = (cid:16)ea

 iy(cid:17) is dened in terms of vielbeins of ads5 and s5,  a = (cid:16)a, ia(cid:17)

where the notation used is same as in [6]. in particular hij is a two-dimensional metric,
ea
satisfy the so(4, 1) and so(5) cliord algebras respectively and i , i = 1, 2 label the
two sets of spinors of these. the two-dimensional indices i, j run over 1 and 2, (a, a) =
(0,    , 4; 5,    9) are (at) tangent space indices for ads5s5, and similarly for the curved
indices (, ).

in order to compute the one loop contribution we will expand (7) to second order in

the uctuations around the classical solution of [4]. in this background the metric on the
worldsheet hij is the one induced from the target space (4), and we will x hij to this
value, (which we will call hcl
ij), by exploiting worldsheet dieomorphism. notice that this
diers from the standard practice of working with a at (or conformally at) worldsheet

metric.

the classical solution is non-trivial only in the bosonic part along the ads5 directions.
consequently uctuations in bosonic degrees of freedom along the ads5 and s5 space, and
uctuations in the fermionic variables all decouple (to second order). therefore one can

study these independently and add up their contributions.

4. fluctuations of the bosonic coordinates

4.1. the ads5 part

the metric in the ads5 space is

(8)

in the above a, b = 0,    , 3; however, in the following the label a = 4 will refer to the radial
coordinate u, and its quantum uctuations. the classical solution has been reviewed in

section 2. we now expand the action in terms of the normal coordinates using standard

technology[8]. to quadratic order this leads to

taken into account. this can be done by following standard procedure. however it turns

a dja + jx

cle

out to be easier to calculate the full induced metric (including uctuations), which can

then be shown to be equal to the sum of (9) plus lagrange multipliers times the constraints

(10).

in order to write the nal form of the ads5 part of the lagrangian, let us introduce

the following linear combinations

k =

u 2
0

u 2 1 + pu 4  u 4

u 2

0

 = pu 4  u 4

u 2

(11)

these are the (normalized) uctuations along the direction parallel (respectively perpendic-

ular) to the classical string conguration. (that these indeed parametrize the uctuations

parallel and perpendicular to the string background is most evident in terms of the normal
coordinates  with curved indices.) in terms of these variables the quadratic part of the

lagrangian takes the following simple form

l(2)

ads5

= 

1

2phcl"hij

cl(cid:0)ij + i2j2 + i3j3(cid:1)

u 4(cid:19)(cid:0)(cid:1)2

+ 2(cid:0)2(cid:1)2

u 4
0

+ 2(cid:0)3(cid:1)2#.

(12)

in writing (12), we have ignored some total derivative terms. one observes that the
uctuations 0 and k along the worldsheet have dropped out of the action. this is a

consequence of the worldsheet dieomorphism, which is completely xed if we eliminate

two redundant degrees of freedom by choosing

0 = k = 0.

5

(13)

this gauge choice is analogous to the non-covariant light-cone gauge, and is consistent

with the static gauge employed to write the classical solution.

finally we notice that the covariant laplacian of the induced metric (4) with its canon-

ical connection, cl = 1hcl
(12) as

i(cid:16)hclhij

clj(cid:17), appears in (12). for future use, let us rewrite

l(2)

ads5

acla  2(cid:0)2(cid:1)2

 2(cid:0)3(cid:1)2

 ,

(14)

where, r(2) = 2(u 4+u 4
0 )/u 4 is the scalar curvature of the two-dimensional induced metric.
the uctuations 2 and 3 in the transverse directions are seen to be massive, while 
moves in a potential. in addition, as u   the uctuations must be required to vanish
as that is where the heavy quarks sit.

4.2. the s5 part

we have assumed for simplicity a trivial background for the s5 part. both the quarks
are at the same point on s5, and this classical position is independent of the worldsheet
coordinates (, ). let a
, a = 5,    , 9 be the normal coordinates denoting the quantum
uctuations on the sphere. these variables behave like the 2,3 uctuations in the ads5
space. the lagrangian relevant for the s5 part is

l(2)
s 5 =

(15)

the uctuations are massless and the the second order operator is just the laplacian of the

induced metric.

5. fluctuations of the fermionic coordinates

let us start by recalling the covariant derivative (dj)i appearing in (7):

(dj)i = dij

j j =(cid:20)ij(cid:18)j +

in [6] there are additional terms in the above denition, but in our context those vanish.
the rst term dji = ji + 1
 bci, is the standard covariant derivative on
the fermions. the additional second term appears due to the non-trivial coupling to the

rr 5-form eld strength. substituting above in (7), and using the properties of gamma

matrices and the fermions given in [6], the fermionic part of the action in the background

of the macroscopic string is compactly written as

now recall that the action (7) or (17) has a local fermionic gauge symmetry, the so

called -symmetry, which has to be xed so as to remove the redundant fermionic degrees

of freedom. it turns out that a most convenient choice is to set

1 = 0

with this choice, the lagrangian (17) simplies to

where the derivatives are with respect to tangent space indices on the worldsheet, and their

denitions are similar to (21) above. however the above form is somewhat deceptive as
 depend on , and hence are not covariantly constant. this situation is remedied by ex-

ploiting the -symmetry xing condition (19). after some straightforward manipulations,

one arrives at

the equations of motion are compactly expressed as

(cid:0)ijj + 3(cid:1)(cid:18) 1
2(cid:19) is a two component spinor of the two-dimensional

(25)

with 3 =diag(1,1), and  = (cid:18) 1

worldsheet. this is the ads analogue of the well-known metamorphosis of target-space

spinors into world-sheet spinors[12].

coming back to (23) now, we see that 1 (say) is completely determined in terms of 2,

which should be treated as independent fermionic elds. since each  had, to start with,

16 components and the gauge condition xing -symmetry (19) reduces these by half, the

fermions have altogether eight on-shell degrees of freedom. this of course matches with

those of the bosonic elds.

the coupled set of rst order equations (23) can be traded for the second order

equation

(cid:18)f 

1
4

r(2) + 1(cid:19) 2 = 0,

(26)

for 2 alone, and similarly for 1. in the above, the 4  4 matrix operator f = hijij
is the laplacian of the generalized covariant derivative (including gauge connection) (23)

acting on the fermions.

8

6. towards evaluation of the determinants

we are now in a position to perform the functional integration over the uctuations,

and give a formal expression for the one-loop result. collecting (14), (15) and (26), we

nd the following expression for w (c) in (6):

w (c) = ear

det(cid:0)f  1

4 r(2) + 1(cid:1)

det (cl + 2) det

1

2 (cid:0)cl + 4  r(2)(cid:1) det

.

5

2 (cl)

(27)

recall that ear is the classical contribution, ar being the (regulated) area of the world-
sheet; and that the fermionic operator in the numerator is a 4  4 matrix operator. the
formal determinants in (27) suer from potential divergences and need to be regulated.

out of many ways to make sense of these, the heat kernel regularization is particularly

convenient. there is a vast literature on this  we will use ref. [13], which gives an

asymptotic expansion for (the logarithm of) such determinants as an innite sum. the

rst few terms in the sum are (regularized) divergent contributions.

let  be an ultraviolet cut-o. it is then easy to see (using the results of [13]), that
the quadratic divergence c22 cancels between the bosons and fermions. in addition, since
we have a worldsheet with boundary, there is a linear divergence c1, which cancels in

the same way. finally, the coecient c0 of the logarithmically divergent term c0 ln , is

given by the dierence in the mass-square between bosons and fermions. we nd that,

contrary to naive expectation, this coecient does not vanish. specically, we nd that

this term is proportional to

c0 z d2phclr(2) = 4t z 

u0

du

where we have used the classical solution (3).

u 4 + u 4
0

u 2pu 4  u 4

0

,

(28)

notice that if we were working in the neveu-schwarz-ramond formalism, divergence

of the form (28), (modulo subtleties involving the boundary), would have signalled a non-

zero -function. and to restore conformal invariance of the sigma model, one will need

to shift the dilaton.

in the green-schwarz approach that we are working with, such a

conclusion is far from obvious, as there is no correpondence between the -function and

equations of motion of the spacetime elds. therefore one should be cautious of such an

interpretation with its implication apparently at variance with the conformal invariance of

the sym theory. this point is worth further critical examination.

9

while we really do not know the full signicance of the logarithmic divergence, let us

nevertheless try to understand it in our context. to this end, we evaluate the coecient c0
by substituting the upper limit of u -integration by a cut-o umax. this is not a new scale,
but was already introduced to regularize the classical contribution[4]. now we expand (28)

in terms of the small parameter u0/umax,

c0 z d2phclr(2) = 4t umax(cid:18)1 + o(cid:18) u 4

max(cid:19)(cid:19) .

0

u 4

(29)

to leading order this does not depend on the separation between the quarks, and goes to

only renormalize the (innite) mass of the quarks. the higher corrections vanish in the
limit umax  .

we recall that the ads5  s5 background was the near horizon limit of n d3-branes.
however, the set up to calculate the quark potential diers in one small, but important

way. here one starts with n + 1 d3-branes and takes one of them far away from the

others. this introduces a scale, whose only eect in the near horizon limit is seen in the

(innite) mass of the heavy quarks. the logarithmic divergence at one-loop goes only to

renormalize this hidden scale. therefore we conclude, (albeit with some caution), that the

one loop regularization does not aect the potential energy between the quark-antiquark

pair.

some of the higher (non-divergent) terms in the innite sum in the expression of the

determinants can be read from ref.[13]. it would be nice to compute the determinants in

closed form.

7. conclusion

in this letter we study the eect of stringy uctuations around the classical macro-

scopic string background that dene expectation value of wilson loop operator in the

ads/cft framework. to this end we expand the green-schwarz type superstring action
for the ads5s5 background[6] to second order in uctuation around the classical solution
in ref.[4]. both reparametrization as well as the local fermionic -symmetry is xed for

this background leaving only physical degrees of freedom. we x dieomorphism not by

the standard choice of a (conformally) at metric on the worldsheet, but rather by xing it

to be the metric induced from the target space. our -symmetry xing condition likewise

diers from that given in refs.[7], and is more suitable for the problem at hand. we com-

ment on the evaluation of the determinants that are the result of functional integration.

10

surprisingly, we nd that the divergent contributions do not completely cancel between

the bose and fermi elds. our understanding of this is admittedly somewhat tentative,

and we leave this issue open for further exploration.

note added:

after we completed this work, the paper [14] appeared in the archive. this also studies

stringy uctuations aecting wilson loop in ads/cft, but in the nite temperature case.

same applies to [15]. the techniques of the present paper have been used in [16] to study
the uctuations of membranes of m-theory in ads7  s4 background. some preliminary
result of the present paper was reported in the ahrenshoop workshop in buckow, germany
