supersymmetries, system breaks supersymmetries theory, free tachyons. motivation study systems two-fold. first, even though non-supersymmetric, relatively simple. instance, supersymmetry pre- served

i) consider initial conguration o3 + d3 system o3-plane, transverse circle s1. m-theory lift obtained rst t-dualizing type iia model, growing m-theory circle s1. case, iia model o4 + d4 wrapped s1, m-theory lift corresponds two m5-branes geometry r4 s1 (r5 s1)/z2. dierent type iib description, corresponding strong coupling limit initial one, achieved shrinking s1 rst t-dualizing along s1.

finally notice discussion ignored issue dynamics modulus associated circle radius, detailed treatment perhaps also taken account. examples mainly center proposal strong coupling limit o3 + d3 system.
