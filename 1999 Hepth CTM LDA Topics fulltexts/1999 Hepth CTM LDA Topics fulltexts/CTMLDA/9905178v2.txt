abstract

if the vacuum is passive for uniformly accelerated observers in antide
sitter spacetime (i.e. cannot be used by them to operate a perpetuum
mobile), they will (a) register a universal value of the hawkingunruh
temperature, (b) discover a tcp symmetry, and (c) nd that observables
in complementary wedgeshaped regions are commensurable (local) in the
vacuum state. these results are model independent and hold in any theory
which is compatible with some weak notion of spacetime localization.

pacs numbers: 04.62.+v, 11.10.cd, 11.30.er

quantum eld theory in antide sitter spacetime (ads) has recently received
considerable attention [1].
it seems therefore worthwhile to clarify in a model
independent setting the universal properties of such theories which are implied
by generally accepted and physically meaningful constraints.

we report here on the results of an investigation of this question [2] which
brought to light the fact that stability properties of the vacuum (the impossibility
of operating a perpetuum mobile) are at the root of (a) the hawkingunruh eect
in ads, (b) a tcplike symmetry in ads, and (c) local commutativity properties
of the observables. as will be explained, these results hold in any quantum
theory in ads which allows one in principle to specify the spacetime localization
properties of observables.

we consider here ads of any dimension n  3. it can conveniently be de-
scribed in terms of cartesian coordinates in the ambient space rn+1 as the quadric

with metric g = diag(1, 1, . . . , 1, 1) in diagonal form. its isometry group is
o(2, n  1) whose identity component will be denoted by so0(2, n1).

any quantum theory in ads has to determine the following structures, which

are indispensible for its physical interpretation:
(i) a hilbert space h, describing the physical states, and a continuous unitary
representation u of the symmetry group so0(2, n1), acting on h.1
(ii) a set of operators which describe the observables of the theory. since these
operators can be added and multiplied, they generate an algebra a which will be
called the algebra of observables.2

it is a fundamental feature of quantum eld theory and its modern ramica-
tions that the spacetime localization properties of observables enter into the for-
malism in an essential way. one can tell whether an observable is localized about
a spacetime point, a string, loop, disk etc. thus, given any region o  adsn , one
can identify those observables which are localized within that region and dene
a corresponding subalgebra a(o)  a which is generated by them. since there
exist no fewer observables if the region becomes larger, one obviously has

a(o1)  a(o2)

if o1  o2.

the localization of observables has to be compatible with the action of the
spacetime symmetry group. if an observable a is localized in the region o, say,
its image u()au()1 under the action of   so0(2, n1) should be localized
in the transformed region o. the transformation properties of the observables
under the action of the unitaries u() may be quite complicated, but fortunately
this detailed information is not needed here. all that matters are the geometrical
aspects of the transformations, which can be summarized as follows.
(iii) for each region o  adsn and   so0(2, n1) one has the equality (in
the settheoretic sense)

u()a(o)u()1 = a(o).

we emphasize that we do not postulate here from the outset local commuta-
tion relations of the observables. for, in contrast to the case of globally hyperbolic
spacetimes, the principle of einstein causality does not provide any clues as to
which observables in ads should commute. instead, we will derive such commuta-
tion relations from stability properties of the vacuum. since this stability aspect
sheds also new light on the phenomenon of the hawkingunruh temperature, we
explain this point in somewhat more detail.

we begin by describing the observers in ads which are of interest here. let
xo  adsn be any point and let (t), t  r, be any oneparameter subgroup
of so0(2, n1) such that t  (t)xo is an orthochronous curve. we interpret
this curve as the worldline of some observer (assumed to be male for concrete-
ness). depending on the initial data chosen, this observer will be geodesic or

1it is sucient here to consider the subspace of bosonic states, so we do not need to

proceed to the covering group of the spacetime symmetry group.

2we work in the framework of von neumann algebras without dwelling on this point any

further. for more information on the mathematical background, cf. [3].

experience some constant acceleration. points in the neighborhood of xo will
in general also give rise to orthochronous curves under the action of the chosen
subgroup of so0(2, n1), and we denote by w the connected neighborhood of
xo in adsn consisting of all such curves. the region w, which can be all of ads
or a subset of it, is that part of the spacetime in which the observer can perform
measurements. the corresponding observables are described by the selfadjoint
elements of a(w) and the corresponding dynamics is given by e itm  u((t))
with generator (hamiltonian) m.3

let us discuss next what this observer can say about the properties of the
vacuum, described by the unit vector |0i  h. first, he can check whether the
vacuum is suitable to operate a perpetuum mobile of the second kind. to this
end he would perform all kinds of operations in w which can be described by
perturbations of the generator m in that region. timedependent perturbation
theory then implies that the state of the vacuum changes under the inuence of
such perturbations and is described by a vector v |0i for some unitary operator
v  a(w) after the perturbation has been turned o. since this challenge of
the second law of thermodynamics ought to fail, the observer should nd that,
no matter what he does, the energy of the nal state is no less than that of the
initial vacuum, i.e. he cannot extract energy from the vacuum. in formula form,

h0| v mv |0i  h0| m |0i

for all unitary operators v  a(w). this property of a state  not being able
to perform work in a cyclic process  is called passivity [4]. it is a mathematical
expression of the second law of thermodynamics .

the observer can also test with the help of time averages of his observables
(yielding order parameters) whether the vacuum is a mixture of dierent phases.
since the vacuum is the most elementary system, the answer should be negative,
i.e. all order parameters should have sharp values. this is the content of the
relation (mixing property)

can be summarized as follows.
(iv) the vacuum |0i is, for all geodesic and all uniformly accelerated observers,
a passive and mixing state.

let us now turn to the analysis of the implications of these assumptions.
here we prot from a deep result of pusz and woronowicz for arbitrary quantum
dynamical systems [4]. in the present context this result says that the vacuum
vector |0i is, as a consequence of its passivity and mixing properties, invariant
under the dynamics of the above observer, i.e. m|0i = 0, and it is either a ground

state for m, or satises, for some a priori unknown   0, the kubomartin
schwinger (kms) condition, which can be presented in the form4

h0|be m a|0i = h0|ab|0i,

for all a, b  a(w). in the latter case the respective observer would interpret
the vacuum as a thermal equilibrium state at temperature  1.

it is convenient here to proceed to another formulation of the above result.
making use of the fact that h0|ab|0i = h0|b a|0i and that the set of vectors
a(w) |0i is dense in h [2], the above relation allows one to dene an antiunitary
operator j on h by setting5

ja|0i  e (/2)m a|0i for a  a(w).

our main task will be to determine the specic properties of this operator. in
order to simplify the necessary computations, we consider the particular choice
of region

w = {x  adsn : x1 > |x0| , xn > 0}

on which the oneparameter subgroup of boosts 01(t), t  r, in the 01plane
acts in an orthochronous manner. for any xo  w, the curve t  01(t)xo is
the worldline of some observer, as described above.

we shall determine the temperature felt by this observer. since the generator
m01 of his dynamics is transfomed into m01 by the adjoint action of the rotation
e im12 in the 12plane, it cannot be a positive operator. hence |0i is not a
ground state for this observer; it must therefore satisfy the kmscondition for
some   0. so what is the value of  ?

to answer this question, we apply the methods in [6]. we pick a region o
such that 02(s) o  w for the boosts 02(s) in the 02plane with suciently
small parameter s. by the group law in so0(2, n1) we have

e itm01e ism02 = e is(cosh(t)m02+sinh(t)m12)e itm01.

taking into account that the boost e ism02 is the dynamics of some other observer,
we infer from (iv) that |0i is invariant under its action. thus we get for any vector
| i  h and operator a  a(o)

h| e itm01 e ism02ae ism02|0i

= h| e is(cosh(t)m02+sinh(t)m12) e itm01a|0i.

at this point we are in the position to combine the kmscondition with a
basic result in the representation theory of lie groups, due to nelson [5]. in the

4since e m is in general an unbounded operator, this relation is to be understood in the

sense of quadratic forms.

5the operator j is called modular conjugation in tomitatakesaki theory. some of our

explicit computations could be abbreviated by using general results from this theory.

present situation this result can be stated as follows: there exists a dense set of
vectors | i  h such that the corresponding vector functions

u, v  e i(um02+vm12) | i

are analytic in a xed neighborhood of the origin of c.

returning to the analysis of the above equality, we note that according to
condition (iii) the operator e ism02ae ism02 appearing in the matrix element on
the left hand side is an element of a(02(s)o)  a(w). so, in view of the kms
property, we can continue this term analytically in t to i/2. in the expression
on the right hand side there appears a product of two unitary operators which
both depend on t. if we choose for | i a nelson vector, as described above, the
rst operator, standing next to h|, can be analytically continued in t to i/2,
provided s is suciently small. the second operator, standing next to a|0i, can
likewise be continued to i/2 by the kmsproperty. so we arrive at

h| e (/2)m01 e ism02ae ism02|0i

= h| e is(cos(/2)m02+i sin(/2)m12)e (/2)m01a|0i.

bearing in mind the denition of j and the invariance of the vacuum under the
boosts e ism02, we can bring this relation into the more transparent form

h| je ism02a|0i = h| e is(cos(/2)m02+i sin(/2)m12)ja|0i.

as this holds for the dense sets of vectors | i and a|0i, respectively, we conclude
that

je ism02 = e is(cos(/2)m02+i sin(/2)m12)j.

the operator on the left hand side is antiunitary, so the same must be true
for the operator on the right hand side. this is only possible if  is an integer
multiple of 2, for otherwise the operator appearing in the exponential function is
not skew-adjoint. by a more rened functional analytic argument one can restrict
 even further and show that its only possible value is  = 2 [2].

proceeding to the proper time scale of the observer3, we conclude that he is
exposed to the hawkingunruh temperature (1/2)(( 01(0) xo)2)1/2, in accor-
dance with the value found in model computations [7] and also by more general
considerations [8]. by similar arguments one can compute the temperature felt
by other observers, such as geodesic ones, for whom it is zero [2]. thus we have
established the following general fact:

each uniformly accelerated observer testing the vacuum state in ads nds a uni-
versal value of the hawkingunruh temperature which depends only on his par-
ticular orbit. for geodesic observers the vacuum is a ground state.

this result is entirely a consequence of the passivity of the vacuum. hence this
state is the only one which is passive for all observers.

having computed the value of , let us return now to the analysis of j.

plugging  = 2 into the above equality for j, we see that for small s

je ism02 = e ism02j.

5

this relation can be extended to arbitrary s by iteration, if one decomposes e ism02
into an mfold product (e i(s/m)m02)m for suciently large m.

in a similar manner one can determine the intertwining properties of j with
other oneparameter subgroups of so0(2, n1), and thereby with all unitaries
u(). we skip these computations and only state the result [2]:

ju() = u()j,

where  is the reection which changes the sign of the 01coordinates of the
points in adsn . this result also allows us to show explicitly5 that j 2 = 1: for
the intertwining relation and the antiunitarity of j imply

je (/2)m01 = e (/2)m01 j,

hence we have, in view of the dening equation for j,

j 2a|0i = je (/2)m01 a|0i = e (/2)m01ja|0i

= e (/2)m01 e (/2)m01a|0i = a|0i,

for all a  a(w). summing up, we have established the following analogue of
the tcptheorem:

the representation u of so0(2, n1)extends to a representation of so(2, n1)in
which the reection  is implemented by the antiunitary operator j.

this result is a purely grouptheoretic statement which does not yet say anything
about the adjoint action of j on the observables. in order to gain insight into
the nature of this latter action, we consider the observables which are localized
in the region

w   {x  adsn : x1 > |x0|, xn > 0}.

since the regions w and w  are obtained by intersecting opposite wedgeshaped
regions in the ambient space with adsn , we call them opposite wedges.

by a rotation in the 12plane about the angle , the region w is transformed
into w , and vice versa. thus, if a  a(w) one has a  e im12ae im12 
a(w ), cf. (iii). by the intertwining relation for j, we have je im12 = e im12j =
e im12j, where we used in the second equality the fact1 that e i2m12 = 1. finally,
the group structure implies that e im12e (/2)m01 = e (/2)m01e im12. combing
these facts, we can compute

ja|0i = je im12a|0i = e im12ja|0i

= e im12e (/2)m01 a|0i = e (/2)m01e im12a|0i
= e (/2)m01a|0i.

picking any a  a(w ), b  a(w), we obtain with the help of this result

h0|ab|0i = h0|b a|0i = h0|b j ja|0i

= h0|b e (/2)m01e (/2)m01a|0i = h0|ba|0i.

6

thus we nd that the elements of a(w) and a(w ) commute in the vacuum state.
it is apparent that the same statement holds also for the algebras corresponding
to all transformed opposite wedges w and w . this commutativity, in the
vacuum state, of observables which are localized in certain complementary regions
is sometimes called weak locality. so we can state:

observables which are localized in opposite wedges of ads are weakly local with
respect to each other.

this establishes the asserted general relation between passivity properties of the
vacuum and commensurability properties of observables. in theories where the
basic elds satisfy cnumber commutation relations, it follows from this result
that observables localized in opposite wedges commute also in the usual (operator)
sense, in accord with the structure found in concrete models [9].

before we turn to the discussion of our results, let us mention another property
of j which holds in all theories complying with the following stronger locality
condition:
(v) observables which are localized in opposite wedges of ads commute with
each other.
this situation prevails in the models of current interest [10].
it implies that
the operator j implements the geometric action of the reection  also on the
observables,

ja(w)j  = a(w).

as a matter of fact, the validity of this relation is equivalent to the strong locality
condition. the proof of this result relies on methods of tomitatakesaki theory
and will be given elsewhere [2]. there it will also be shown that mild constraints
on the mulitplicities of the eigenvalues 2n0 of the generator m0n (existence of
the partition function tr e m0n) imply that observables in opposite wedges are
statistically (causally) independent [11].

we have thus established in this letter a tight relation between stability prop-
erties of the vacuum, a tcp theorem, and commensurabilty properties of ob-
servables in ads. such relations exist also in other spacetimes, but they are of
particular interest in the case of ads. for they reveal that observables in oppo-
site wedges w and w  necessarily commute with each other, either weakly or
strongly.

in the case of proper ads, this result appears to be very strange at rst sight,
since any point in w can be connected with any other point in w  by some causal
curve. hence measurements at these points should aect each other and not be
commensurable (let alone be statistically independent).

after a moments reection, however, one sees that the regions w and w ,
although causally connected in the usual sense, cannot be connected by causal
geodesics. so the following picture emerges, which explains the unexpected com-
mensurability properties of the observables: the perturbations which are produced
by observers in the region w move, after having left the region, along geodesics
and therefore do not reach w . in noninteracting theories this picture is reason-
able, and free eld models show that it is also consistent. but it is in conict with

7

the patterns of interaction processes which would inevitably lead to incommensu-
rablilites of observables in opposite wedge regions. this clash between geometry
and interaction can be evaded if one proceeds from proper ads to its covering
space, where opposite wedges are causally disjoint.
