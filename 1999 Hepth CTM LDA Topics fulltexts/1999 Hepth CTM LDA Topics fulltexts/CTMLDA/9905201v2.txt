abstract

the one-loop eective action of the abelian and nonabelian higgs models has
been studied in various gauges, in the context of instanton and sphaleron
transition, bubble nucleation and most recently in nonequilibrium dynamics.
gauge invariance is expected on account of nielsen s theorem, if the classical
background eld is an extremum of the classical action, i.e., a solution of the
classical equation of motion. we substantiate this general statement for
the one-loop eective action, as computed using mode functions. we show
that in the gauge-higgs sector there are two types of modes that satisfy
the same equation of motion as the faddeev-popov modes. we apply the
general analysis to the computation of the uctuation determinant for bubble
nucleation in the su(2) higgs model in the t hooft gauge with general gauge
parameter . we show that due to the cancellation of the modes mentioned
above the uctuation determinant is independent of .

1 introduction

the eective potential of gauge theories has been considered extensively as
it is of interest for the phase structure of these theories, and in particular
for the discussion of phase transitions and the associated bubble nucleation
rates [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. more generally the eective action appears when
computing uctuation corrections to the sphaleron [7, 8, 9, 10] and instanton
[11] transition rates in such theories.

it is well known that the eective potential is gauge dependent except
for the region around the extrema of the eective action, where nielsen s
theorem states that the gauge dependence should disappear [12]. this has
been veried in various cases [13, 14, 15]. besides the static extrema such as
the minima and maxima of the eective potential nielsen s theorem more
generally applies to the extrema of the eective action, i.e. to the extremal,
classical paths in conguration space, such as the bubble and sphaleron ac-
tions. it has been veried [16], using the gradient expansion, that for the
leading orders in the coupling the quantum corrections to the bubble nucle-
ation rate are gauge independent. exact numerical computations are based
on the analysis and numerical computation of mode functions in the back-
ground of the classical solution. such computations are quite demanding
numerically, as well as algebraically and analytically, so in general the au-
thors just used one particular gauge, as e.g. the t hooft feynman gauge and
a concise discussion of gauge independence is lacking.

we have recently analyzed the evolution equations for a higgs condensate
and the gauge and higgs eld uctuations in the su(2) higgs model, in
one-loop approximation [17]. here again the question of gauge dependence
arises and has not yet been analyzed. for the abelian higgs model, a gauge
invariant formalism has been developed, which, however, has not yet been
implemented numerically [18, 19].

we consider here the su(2) higgs model with an isoscalar higgs back-
ground eld. such a conguration plays a central role in the discussion of
the electroweak phase transition. its nite temperature eective potential
has been discussed extensively, and it has been used to predict the rate of
bubble nucleation in a rst order phase transition [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

the plan of the paper is as follows: in the section 2 we present the basic
equations, and we expand the lagrangian into a classical and a second order
uctuation part. in section 3 we present the equations of motion without
gauge-xing, and in the t hooft background gauge for arbitrary gauge pa-

1

rameter . we show that there are two types of modes, the gauge modes
and the gauge-xing modes that satisfy the same equations of motion as the
faddeev-popov ghosts, if the classical background eld satises its equation
of motion. this observation is the clue for a reduction of the mode equations
into equations for the physical degrees of freedom and into equations whose
functional determinant is cancelled by the faddeev-popov one. this reduc-
tion depends on the system under consideration. here we demonstrate the
cancellation of the unphysical modes for the uctuation determinant which
determines the uctuation corrections to bubble nucleation, in the su(2)
higgs model. we briey introduce the model and its uctuation operator in
section 4. the coupled gauge-higgs system is analyzed in the partial-wave re-
duced equations in section 5. after some suitable transformations the system
is reduced to a triangular form, with the consequence that the uctuation
determinant can be computed from the diagonal part. thereby the cancella-
tion against the faddeev-popov contributions to the uctuation determinant
is demonstrated explicitly. we present some conclusions in section 6.

the lagrangian of the su(2) higgs model reads

we will assume in the following a classical eld (condensate)

(x) = h(x)  0

1 ! ,

2

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

its space-time dependence is not further specied here. a time-independent,
metastable, radially symmetric conguration will be relevant for bubble nu-
cleation, a spatially homogenous time dependent eld describes a nonequilib-
rium situation, as considered in [17]. the uctuations around this space-time
dependent condensate are parameterized as

(x) = [h(x) + h(x) + iaa(x)]  0

1 ! ,

(2.6)

with the isoscalar higgs mode h(x) and the would-be goldstone elds a(x),
a = 1 . . . 3. as there is no classical gauge eld, we have

a

a(x) = a

a(x) .

the lagrangian can then be split into a classical part

lcl(x) =

1

2 "hh

(h 2  v2)2#

(2.7)

(2.8)

and a uctuation lagrangian. the part of rst order in the uctuating eld
vanishes, if the classical equation of motion

h + (h 2  v2)h = 0

(2.9)

is fullled. the part of second order in the uctuations reads

in the one-loop approximation we do not have to consider higher order terms.

3 gauge mode and gauge-xing mode

before discussing the uctuation operator for a specic physical setting we
specify here the unphysical degrees of freedom in the gauge eld and would-be
goldstone sector whose cancellation against the faddeev-popov modes will
lead to a gauge invariant uctuation determinant. the uctuation operator
of the isoscalar higgs mode h(x) is gauge invariant from the outset.

we arrange the gauge eld uctuations a

a and the would-be goldstone

elds a in a (4 + 1) column vector

a = ( a

a ) .

a

(3.1)

we start with the equations of motion obtained without the gauge-xing
term. the dierential operator (uctuation operator) governing the mode
evolution then takes the form

m = ( ( + g2

4 h 2)
gh  g

 +   g
2 h

 + (h 2  v2) ) .
2  h + g

2 h

the mode equations are the same for all a = 1, 2, 3 ,

an innitesimal gauge transform is given by

ma = 0 .

g

a(x) = ( 

2 h(x) ) fa(x) .

g

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

these modes satisfy the mode equation (3.3) if h(x) satises the classical
eld equation (2.9). the latter condition is crucial. it arises from the mode
equation for a, the one for the vector potentials is fullled trivially.

if the gauge mode is substituted into the gauge condition one nds

(fa)g = " + 

g2
4

h 2(x)# fa ,

(3.5)

the dierential operator on the r.h.s.
is just the faddeev-popov operator.
so, if the gauge mode is inserted into the lagrangian, the gauge-xing term
contains the faddeev-popov operator squared. it is very suggestive that the

4

contribution of this squared operator to the eective action , i.e., to the
log det of the uctuation operator, is cancelled by twice the log det of the
faddeev-popov operator.

if the gauge-xing term is included the uctuation operator takes the

form

( + g2

4 h 2)

 +(cid:16)1  1

(cid:17) 

gh

gh

 + (h 2  v2) + g2

.

4 h 2 


mf = 


(3.6)
if we apply the uctuation operator to the gauge mode, and use the classical
equation of motion, we obtain

mfg

a(x) = (  1

2 h(x) )" + 

 

g

g2
4

h 2(x)# fa(x) = mfpfa(x) .

(3.7)

the dierential operator appearing on the right hand side is just the faddeev-
popov operator

mfp =  + 

h 2(x) .

(3.8)

g2
4

if fa is an eigenfunction of the faddeev-popov operator, mfpfa = 2
then the associated gauge mode satises

fpfa,

(  0

1 ) mfg

0

a = 2

fpg
a .

(3.9)

the factor  in the matrix multiplies the four gauge eld components. so
the uctuation operator modied by multiplication with a constant matrix,
has a class of eigenfunctions with the same eigenvalues as the faddeev-popov
operator. in the eective action the modication by the constant matrix is
irrelevant, as one computes the ratio between the uctuation determinants
in the background eld and in a standard vacuum conguration, to which
the same arguments apply.

now consider the gauge condition fa. we introduce the covector

so that

u = (cid:20), 

g
2

h(x)(cid:21) ,

fa = ua .

5

(3.10)

(3.11)

consider an arbitrary mode a. we then nd, using again the classical
equation of motion,

u(  0

1 ) mfa = " + 

0

g2
2

h 2(x)# ua = mfpfa .

(3.12)

a now be an eigenmode of the modied uctuation operator with eigen-

let 
value 2

. then this equation entails

u2



a = (

a )2 f 

a = mfpf 
a .

(3.13)

so if the projection on the vector u is dierent from zero the eigenvalue
is simultaneously an eigenvalue of mfp. we thereby have a second class
of modes on which the uctuation operator of the gauge-higgs system has
the same spectrum as the faddeev-popov operator. we call them gauge-
xing modes. we have to make sure that this class of modes, obtained by a
projection, is not empty, and not identical with the gauge modes.

obviously the modes on which the projector u yields zero are those
which satisfy the gauge condition, these are the physical modes. we know
that out of the ve components of the gauge-higgs modes  only three are
physical, they represent the spatial components of the massive gauge eld.

we next consider the action of the projector on the gauge eigenmodes. it

is convenient to introduce a vector v that generates the gauge modes via

we note that

g

a = vfa = 


g
2



h(x) 


fa .

uv =  + 

g2
4

h 2 .

(3.14)

(3.15)

this implies that the gauge-xing mode obtained by projection of a gauge
mode satises

fa = ug

a = uvfa = " + 

g2
4

h 2(x)# fa .

(3.16)

so if fa is an eigenfunction of the faddeev-popov operator, then the gauge-
xing mode generated from it does not represent a new, independent mode.
however, the gauge modes and the physical modes do not exhaust the hilbert

6

space that is based on ve eld degrees of freedom, and we are sure that the
projector does not give zero on the remaining subspace.

we have shown up to now, that for a background eld satisfying the
classical equation of motion there are two classes of modes whose contribution
to the eective action will be cancelled by the one of the faddeev-popov
sector. we have not shown, thereby, that the remaining physical part of
the gauge-higgs sector becomes independent of . furthermore, the way
in which the modes are eliminated is a technical matter, it depends on the
structure of the background eld, and on the problem under consideration.
so if we want to illustrate the application of these general results we have to
consider specic models.

we will here analyze the modes introduced above, and the cancellation
of their contribution to the uctuation determinant, for the case of bubble
nucleation in the su(2) higgs model.

4 bubble nucleation in the su (2) higgs model

bubble nucleation occurs in the su(2) higgs model if the phase transition
from the symmetric high temperature phase to the broken symmetry phase at
low temperature is rst order. it has been considered as providing a possible
mechanism for baryogenesis, a possibility ruled out by the present lower
limit for the higgs mass. still the model is of interest, in particular it can
be studied in lattice simulations for suciently low higgs masses. the phase
transition is described (see, e.g., [20]), by the 3-dimensional high-temperature
action

is given by

exp( s) j 1/2 .

(4.13)

here s is the high-temperature action, eq. (4.1), minimized by a classical
minimal bubble conguration (see below), j is the uctuation determinant
which describes the next-to-leading part of the semiclassical approach and

(x) = [h(r) + h(x) +  aa(x)]  0

(4.17)

where aa

, h and a are the uctuating elds, denoted collectively by i.

if the action is expanded with respect to the uctuating elds, the rst
order term vanishes if h(r) satises the classical equation of motion (4.15).

the uctuation determinant j appearing in the rate formula is dened by 3

decomposes under partial wave expansion into uctuation operators for xed
angular momentum. it is these that we will consider in the following.

the background eld is isoscalar, so the isospin index a just results
in multiplicity factors, we will omit it in the following. the scalar elds

the uctuation operator of this coupled system is hermitean, as it should, be-
cause it arises from the variation of a lagrangian. the asymmetry suggested
by the explicit form arises from integrations by parts.

the gauge parameter  only occurs in the coupled system and for the
faddeev-popov modes. the cancellation of the  dependence will have to
occur between these two sectors. they will be analyzed in the next section.

5 analysis of the uctuation operator

in analyzing the gauge dependence we will have to consider the coupled sys-
tem of the modes fa, fb, and f, i.e., the radial mode functions for angular
momentum . in analogy to section 3 we consider the uctuation operator
multiplied from the left by a constant matrix diag(, , 1). the eigenvalue
problem for the uctuation operator then takes the form of the three dier-
ential equations for the radial mode functions for angular momentum :

in view of the general arguments of section 3 we now should identify the gauge
and the gauge-xing modes. a general gauge transformation is parameterized
by a function (x). it can be expanded into partial waves with respect to
spherical harmonics, the radial mode function is denoted by f(r). the gauge
mode then takes the form

a (r) = q( + 1)f(r)
f g
f g
b (r) = f 

f g
(r) = 

f(r) .

(r)
h(r)

2

(5.4)

the partial wave amplitude of the gauge-xing mode f is obtained from the
general denition

f (x) = a(x) + 

h(r)

2

(x) .

(5.5)

this equation is expanded into partial waves. the radial mode function of
the mode f then reads

ff (r) = f 

b(r) +

fb(r)  q( + 1)

r

fa(r) + 

h(r)

f(r) .

(5.6)

it can be checked, using the basic dierential equations (5.1)-(5.3) and the
dierential equation for the background eld (4.15), that the mode ff satis-
es the dierential equation for the faddeev-popov modes

likewise, if the gauge function f(r) satises this dierential equation then
the mode functions f g
(5.4), satisfy the basic
dierential equations (5.1)-(5.3). this is as to be expected from the general
arguments.

n generated from it via eq.

we now try to separate the system of dierential equations by introducing
a suitable set of new mode functions. we rst eliminate the mode fa(r) in
favor of ff (r),

fa(r) = r

ff (r) + f 

b(r) + 2fb(r)  (/2)h(r)f(r)

(5.9)

having eliminated fa(r) in this way it cannot be used anymore as gauge
mode, for which now fb(r) is a possible candidate, however one cannot use
a simple algebraic substitution. we introduce the new mode function fg(r),
analogous to (r), and eliminate fb(r) with the substitution

we make the two other amplitudes gauge invariant by dening

fb(r) =

d

fg(r) .

h(r)

f(r) = f(r) +
fg(r)
ff (r) = ff (r) + 2fg(r) .

the latter equation follows from the general relation (3.16). we now have
to nd the equation of motion for the amplitude fg(r). in view of its close

obviously, we have not succeeded in separating the system. however, in
this form the gauge and gauge-xing modes are easy to identify. we see
that with the choice f = 0 and ff = 0 the function r(r) vanishes and
the dierential equation for fg becomes the faddeev-popov equation again,
with a corresponding energy spectrum. likewise, the combination ff =
ff + 2fg still satises (5.9) and has a faddeev-popov eigenvalue spectrum
as well. however, we do not nd another linearly independent combination
of amplitudes involving the amplitude f that would satisfy a dierential
equation independent of . so that part of the energy spectrum that is not
compensated by the faddeev-popov contributions apparently still depends
on the choice of .

matters are dierent, however, if we evaluate the eective action. this
can be done using the uctuation modes at  = 0, using a general theorem on
uctuation determinants [28], generalized to coupled systems, that has been
used, e.g., for computing the uctuation corrections to bubble nucleation [3].
it is based on the equation 4

here m is the partial wave uctuation operator as dened previously, and
the matrix f(, r) is an (n  n) matrix formed by a fundamental system of n
linearly independent n-tuples of solutions for a given , regular at r = 0. the
operator m0 and the solutions f0 refer to a trivial background eld congu-
ration, in the present case to the symmetric vacuum state characterized by
h(r)  0. it is understood, that both systems f and f0 are started, at r = 0
with identical initial conditions. finally, the desired uctuation determinant
is given by j  j (0).

if we apply the theorem we only need the coupled system of dierential
equations for  = i = 0, and then it decouples in a triangular way. the
right hand side of the equation for ff vanishes entirely, the r.h.s. of the
dierential equation for f only depends on ff , while both f and ff appear
on the r.h.s. of the equation for fg. furthermore, for ff = 0, the dierential
equation for f becomes independent of . we can choose the following set
of linearly independent solutions:

(i) a gauge mode solution f g

n with f g

f  0 and f g

  0, for which f g

g evolves

in the same way as a pure faddeev-popov mode;

(ii) a physical solution f 

 evolves independently;
it appears on the right hand side of the dierential equation for f 
g , which
can be obtained by using the green function of the homogenous equation,
and nally

f  0; then f 

n with f 

n , where f f

(iii) a gauge-xing mode solution f f

f is dierent from zero.
for  = 0 the r.h.s. of (5.17) vanishes and ff evolves like a faddeev-popov
mode. both other amplitudes are dierent from zero in this case. note that
the second type of solution is determined only modulo an arbitrary multiple
of the rst one, and the third one only modulo arbitrary multiples of both
other ones. this does not aect the determinant det f(0, r), however.

the structure of the matrix f(0, r) now is triangular and its determinant

is obtained from the diagonal elements as

det f(0, r) = f g

g (0, r) f f

f (0, r) f 

 (0, r) = f 2

fp(0, r) f 

 (0, r) .

(5.19)

the same structure holds for the free solutions which have to be started
at r = 0 with identical initial conditions, i.e. with the same coecients
of the lowest powers of r, as determined by the centrifugal barriers. we
have considered the behavior at r = 0 in detail and have veried that an
appropriate choice is possible.

the eective action is obtained by adding the logarithms of the vari-
ous uctuation determinants for all independent systems, and for all partial

15

waves. the only  dependence occurs in the gauge and gauge-xing modes
of the coupled system, and for the two faddeev-popov modes. as these
compensate each other the total eective action becomes independent of .
for the practical computation this means that for the coupled system we

just have to solve the integro-dierential equation for f with ff = 0, i.e.,

from this derivation and discussion it is clear that the gauge independence
only holds for the eective action, and not for other physical quantities.
the nondiagonal parts of the mode solutions still depend on , so other
expectation values are aected by the gauge parameter .

6 conclusion

we have given general arguments, based on the uctuation operator and
the mode expansion, for the gauge independence of the one-loop eective
action, computed for a background eld which solves the classical equation
of motion. there are various cases for which the one-loop eective action,
and its gauge independence, are of interest. it appears in particular in the
corrections to quantum or thermal tunneling rates obtained in the semiclas-
sical approximation. for the case of bubble nucleation the analysis of section
3 fully applies. we have veried in the partial wave mode equations [3],
that the system of these dierential equations can be cast, at zero frequency,
into a triangular form. a theorem on uctuation determinants relates the
uctuation determinant to the asymptotic behavior as r  , of a linearly
independent system of solutions regular at r = 0. the matrix formed by
the n linearly independent n-tuples of solutions can be cast into a triangular
form as well, two of the diagonal elements evolve like the faddeev-popov
modes. their contribution to the logarithm of the uctuation determinant
is cancelled by the one of the faddeev-popov modes. the remaining diag-
onal elements are independent of . the nal conclusion is that the exact
one-loop correction to the nucleation rate is gauge independent. this goes
beyond the results of ref.
[16], where a similar statement was derived for
the leading orders in the gauge coupling, using the gradient expansion. this

16

latter publication is, in part, complementary to our work: we have not con-
sidered the divergent parts and renormalization. within our method [2, 3]
the divergent parts can be separated analytically from the computation of
the determinants and take the form of ordinary feynman graphs. so the -
independence of the renormalized leading order contributions, as established
in [16], closes our argument.

we should like to add a comment on the use of partial resummations.
indeed the high temperature eective potential (4.11), from which the clas-
sical solution is computed, already contains one-loop eects. this introduces
some double-counting that has to be compensated for [11]. if the resumma-
tion includes the coupled gauge-higgs sector, the  dependence is there from
the outset and can disappear only if all higher-loop orders are summed up.
one therefore has to make sure that the high temperature resummation, that
in an essential way determines the structure of the phase transition, takes
into account transverse gauge loops and the isoscalar higgs loop only. then
this modication of the classical higgs potential does not interfere with
our analysis.

it is not clear how far the conclusions obtained for the special case con-
sidered here can be generalized to dierent gauge theories, and to dierent
physical systems. for the sphaleron [9], and also for topologically nontrivial
solutions in other models, as the instanton of the abelian higgs model in
(1 + 1) dimensions [11], the application of the determinant theorem meets
diculties [30]: the contribution of the s-wave diverges and the compensa-
tion of this divergence by the sum over the higher partial waves requires a
suitable regularization. it would be worthwhile to pursue this issue.

another system which should be investigated are the quantum uctu-
ations for the su(2) higgs model in nonequilibrium dynamics [17]. here
the applicability is certainly limited by the inclusion of the quantum back
reaction on the background eld. this back reaction changes the classical
equation of motion, while analogous changes of the quantum mode equations
depend on the resummation.
