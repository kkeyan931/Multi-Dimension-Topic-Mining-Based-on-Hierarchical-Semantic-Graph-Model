abstract

supersymmetric congurations of type ii d-branes with nonzero gauge eld strengths

in general supersymmetric backgrounds with nonzero b elds are analyzed using the -

symmetric worldvolume action. it is found in dimension four or greater that the usual

instanton equation for the gauge eld obtains a nonlinear deformation. the deformation

is parameterized by the topological data of the b-eld, the background geometry and

the cycle wrapped by the brane. in the appropriate dimensions, limits and settings these

equations reduce to deformed instanton equations recently found in the context of noncom-

mutative geometry as well as those following from lagrangians based on bott-chern forms.

we further consider instantons comprised of m5-branes wrapping a calabi-yau space with

non-vanishing three-form eld strengths. it is shown that the instanton equations for the

three-form are related to the kodaira-spencer equations.

1. introduction and conclusion

supersymmetric cycle conditions are of importance in string theory because these are

the equations governing the existence of bps states and supersymmetric instantons asso-

ciated with wrapped p-branes. these supersymmetric cycle conditions are equations for a

pair consisting of an embedded manifold in spacetime, together with a gauge connection

on the embedded manifold. there is by now a rich literature for the special case in which

the gauge eld strength f on the brane as well as the background supergravity potentials

b vanish. the general case of nonzero f or b in contrast has received less attention.

in this paper the more general case is addressed. d-branes with nonzero u (1) gauge

elds f in supersymmetric iia and iib supergravity backgrounds with nonzero b elds

are analyzed using the recently discovered -symmetric worldvolume actions [1,2,3]. in

all cases considered, we nd that the conditions governing supersymmetrically embedded
cycles are unchanged by b 6= 0.3 in contrast, the equation for the gauge eld on the cycle
is, in dimension four or greater, an intriguing nonlinear deformation of the usual instanton

equation. the deformed equation depends on the topological data of both the cycle and

the b eld.

an important motivation for this work is its application to the study of yang-mills

theory in a non-commutative geometry. the connection between noncommutative geom-

etry and string theory was rst noted by connes, douglas, and schwarz [4]. recently,

seiberg and witten [5] have related the study of bps congurations of d-branes to var-

ious aspects of noncommutative geometry. in particular it is shown how the presence of

a nonzero b-eld deforms the instanton equations, in a way related to the noncommu-

tative instanton equations of nekrasov and schwarz [6]. we will nd that our deformed

equations reduce to those of [5] in the appropriate limit and setting. it further generalizes
those equations to curved backgrounds and to higher dimensions. in ir4 we nd an addi-
tional deformation parameter away from the limit considered in [5].4 in particular we nd

that the hermitian yang-mills equations of six dimensions are also modied, and that the

discussion of [5] relating bps conditions to the noncommutative instanton equations of

nekrasov-schwarz [6] generalizes nicely to this case. we also nd that the g2 and spin(7)
instanton equations are not deformed, and the instanton equations on calibrated 4-cycles

in such manifolds are likewise not deformed.

3 the cases we consider do not include certain interesting singularities, such as occur in bions.
4 this additional parameter was known to the authors of [5].

2

this paper also has two unexpected results. the rst novelty is that the nonlinear

deformations of the instanton equations arising from bps conditions are closely related to

the equations for hermitian metrics on holomorphic vector bundles discussed by leung [7]

and by losev et. al. [8]. the second novelty appears when we further extend our analysis

to the case of an m5-brane wrapping a calabi-yau threefold. the m5-brane worldvolume

contains a closed rank three antisymmetric tensor eld strength h which obeys a nonlinear

self-duality constraint [9][10]. in [11] a nonlinear change of variables to a 3-form h was

found such that h is self-dual, but satises a nonlinear equation of motion. we show that,

when combined with the condition of preserving a supersymmetry, this nonlinear equation

of motion is just the kodaira-spencer equation together with a gauge condition. the gauge

condition is a deformation of the standard one, and it shown that a solution exists through

third order in perturbation theory.

this paper raises a number of interesting open problems. in principle non-abelian ver-

sions of our deformed equations could be derived via string theory by considering multiply-

wrapped d-branes. in practice this would be dicult. however in most cases the equations

we write have obvious non-abelian generalizations which we expect to apply to this case.

moreover, the relation to [8] opens up a host of new issues and questions related to the

possible use of higher dimensional bc systems.

a brief outline of the paper is the following. section 2 is a lightning review of the

relevant -symmetric d-branes [1,2]. in section 3 we show that the cycle embeddings are

undeformed and derive the deformed instanton equations for a variety of branes embedded
in manifolds of su (2), su (3), g2, su (4) and spin(7) holonomy. a group theoretic analysis
of the equations and their solutions for ir4, ir6 and ir8 is given in section 4. in section
5 we relate a limit of the ir4 equations to those derived by seiberg and witten in the
context of noncommutative geometry, and then generalize the relation to ir6. in section
7, we briey discuss the relation of the present results to those of leung [7] and losev et.

al.

[8]. finally, in section 8, we analyze the supersymmetry conditions for an m5 brane

wrapping a calabi-yau threefold.

2. review of -symmetry and the -operator

we start with a very brief review of d-brane actions, -symmetry and the properties

of the -operator that are crucial for our discussion. the action was constructed in [1,2]

and is of the form (for constant dilaton)

ip = idbi + iwz = tpzw

dp+1qdet(g + m ) + zw

c  em .

(2.1)

3

here w is the brane worldvolume. tp and  are the brane tensions and charges, respec-

tively. the metric on w

g = e

ae

bab ,

is induced by supermaps z = (x, ) and super-vielbein

e

a = zmem

a .

(2.2)

(2.3)

the frame index a decomposes into 10 vector (a) and 32 spinor () indices (and an
sl(2, ir) index (a) in type iib case). m ( = 1,    (p + 1)) is the modied 2-form eld
strength m = 2(f + b) with b being the pull-back of the ns two-form eld to the

worldvolume. the couplings to the background rr elds are given by the second term in

(2.1), where

c =

c(r)

10xr=0

is a formal sum of the rr elds c(r) (we are ignoring the gravitational couplings here).

since in addition to -symmetry, the classical d-brane actions have spacetime super-

symmetry, we can combine both, and in particular determine the fraction of unbroken

supersymmetry by the dimension of the solution space of the equation [12,13]:

where  is the spacetime supersymmetry parameter, and  is an hermitian traceless matrix:

(1  ) = 0,

(2.4)

tr  = 0,

2 = 1 .

(2.5)

the explicit form for  will be important for our analysis (note that we are working

with euclidean branes):

where |g| := det(g ), |g + m| := det(g + m ), and

xn=0

 = p|g|p|g + m|
(p) =( i(11(cid:1)n+ p2
2 (0)
(1)n(3)n+ p3

j (n)

2nn!

11...nn m11 . . . mnn j (n)
(p) ,

(for iia)

(for iib).

2 2  (0)
4

(2.6)

(2.7)

finally, (0) is dened as

(0) =

1

(p + 1)!p|g|

with

1...(p+1) 1...(p+1) ,

(2.8)

 = e

aa ,

where {a; a = 0, . . . 9} are the spacetime gamma-matrices.

a very important feature is that the non-linear dependence on m can be expressed

in the form [3]:

 = ea/2 

(0) ea/2 ,

(2.9)

where a = a(m ) contains all the dependence on m and 

(0) (which depends only on x)

is also an hermitian traceless matrix (i.e. tr 

= 1) given by:

(0) = 0 and(cid:16)

(0)(cid:17)2

(0) =( (11)

(3)



p2

p3

2 (0)
2 2  (0)

(for iia)
(for iib).

(2.10)

an explicit expression for a can be found in a local euclidean frame in which m is skew-

diagonal [3]:

where y is

a =(cid:26) 1

2 yjk3  jk

(for iia)
(for iib)

y =

2

mikei  ek =

[(p+1)/2]xr=1

tan 2r1,2re2r1  e2r.

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

in these equations, e is the vielbein on the worldvolume (g = ei
i, k = 0, . . . , p ). notice that,

ik, with
if we dene the matrices

in any orthonormal frame,

the relation between m and y is

m =pi,j mijtij, y =pi,j yijtij, where tij = eij  eji and eij are matrix units, then
as a nal remark about notation, we will use volp+1 =p|g|dp+1 to denote the canonical

volume element on the p-brane associated to the induced riemannian metric g.

m = tanh(y ).

3. deformed equations for bps congurations

in our discussion we will consider only two types of geometry:

 innite at branes, lling a submanifold irp+1{pt}  irp+1m9p. these are analyzed
in section 4.
 branes wrapping cycles in manifolds of irreducible non-trivial holonomy. there is a
nite number of such cases that preserve supersymmetry and these can be summarized in

a table:

table 3. cycles in manifolds of irreducible non-trivial holonomy.

cycles marked in the table are those that solve (1  ) = 0 in the absence of b-eld
and gauge elds on the branes. in this section we investigate how the story changes in

the presence of b and gauge elds. in the cases we examine, there are no changes in the

conditions on the cycle itself.5 the gauge elds on the other hand are found (in dimension

four or greater) to obey non-linear generalizations of the usual instanton equations.

5 we have not however completely ruled out the interesting possibility (raised in [14]) that the

cycles themselves are sometimes deformed.

6

3.1. su(2) holonomy

we start by analyzing manifolds of su (2) holonomy. there are two covariantly con-

stant spinors of the same chirality, + and , and we will choose them in such a way

that

m+ = 0,

mn+ = mn.

(3.1)

with our conventions, the basis for spinors is given by +, mn+ for spinors of negative
chirality, and m+ for spinors of positive chirality. notice that mn = mn+. we
have normalized ||||2 = 4.

3.1.1.p = 1

we rst consider the case of a one-brane wrapping a 2-cycle. using the explicit

expression for  given in (2.6), the equation  = , where  is an sl(2, ir) doublet of

spinors, becomes

p|g|p|g + m|(cid:0)1 
p|g|p|g + m|(cid:0)1 +

1
2

1
2

m(cid:1)(0)1 = i2,
m(cid:1)(0)2 = i1.

(3.2)

the second equation is actually a consequence of the rst, as follows from the identity
2 = 1. the spinors 1,2 are covariantly constant, so they must be of the form 1 =
z++ + z and 2 = w++ + w, where z, w are constants. we can always
normalize 1 as z = ei. using the above identities for the s, and mn+ = ijmn+,
we nd that unbroken supersymmetry requires |w+|2 + |w|2 = 2. we then introduce
three angles , , and write w+ = 2 cos ei+ and w = 2 sin ei . one nds the
following equations:

f () =

f (j) + im =

iei
2
ei
2

(sin ei + cos ei+ )p|g + m|p|g|
(cos ei+  sin ei )p|g + m|p|g|

vol2,

(3.3)

vol2.

the above equations can be written as

(cid:18) f (j) + im
if () (cid:19) = u(cid:18) 1

0(cid:19)p|g + m|p|g|

7

vol2,

(3.4)

where u is a constant u (2) matrix . notice that, when m = 0, we obtain the usual calibra-
tion condition for a 2-cycle in a k3 manifold that the real vector (f (j), re(f ()), im(f ()))

lies on a sphere of radius vol2 (see, for example, [15], section v.3):

(f (j), re(f ()), im(f ())) = (cos , sin  cos , sin  sin )vol2,

(3.5)

where ,  are constant angles along the two-cycle. the s2 that shows up in (3.5) is in fact
related to the s2 of complex structures. if one chooses a complex structure by choosing a

direction, the corresponding point on the sphere gives the holomorphic condition for the

2-cycle, while the intersection of the normal plane to this direction with the sphere gives
the s1 family of special lagrangian submanifolds. of course, both are related by an so(3)

rotation.

since m is an antisymmetric tensor in two dimensions, one has |g + m| = |g| + m 2.

using this, it is easy to check from (3.4) that:

m = 

vol2,

im u11

p1  (im u11)2

vol2,

f () =

f (j) = 

re u11

p1  (im u11)2

iu21

p1  (im u11)2

vol2,

(3.6)

where u11 and u21 are the corresponding entries of the matrix u , and are constant complex
numbers. the equations (3.6) say that the vector (f (j), re(f ()), im(f ())) still has

the structure (3.5), even for a nonzero m . therefore, the born-infeld eld m does not

change the usual calibration condition.

3.1.2.p = 3

for a d3-brane wrapping a four-cycle, the condition  =  of unbroken supersym-

metry reduces to

p|g|p|g + m|(cid:0)1 +
p|g|p|g + m|(cid:0)1 +

1
8

8

m m +

m m 

1
2

1
2

m(cid:1)(0)1 = i2,
m(cid:1)(0)2 = i1,

(3.7)

where again  = (1 , 2)t . when d3 wraps the manifold itself, when solving (1 ) = 0
we can take into account that, according to our conventions, (0) = . using the ansatz

8

above for the spinors 1,2, one nds again that |w+|2 + |w|2 = 2, and the following
equations:

vol4,

(3.8)

(cid:18) 1

2 (j + im )2

m   (cid:19) = u(cid:18) 1

0(cid:19)p|g + m|p|g|

where u is again a u (2) matrix.

we have a family of solutions depending on the value of u . for example, if u =

(cid:18) 0 1
0 (cid:19), then one can check that m = re() is a solution of the equations. to see
1
this, one has to use that m 1,1 = 0, and that m  m = 2 vol4. if u is the identity matrix,
one has m   = 0, and (j + im )2/2p|g + m| is a constant phase times d4. the rst
that (j + im )2/2p|g + m|d4 is in fact a complex number of modulus one. for u = 1,

equation says that m 2,0 = 0. using the fact that j 2/2 is the volume element, one sees

the above equations can then be written as:

j  m = k (vol4 
m 2,0 = 0,

1
2

m  m ),

(3.9)

where k is a constant.

for a compact 4-cycle 4 the value of k in (3.9) is determined in terms of the topo-
logical data. let the closed two forms ci , i = 1, 2, ...b2 be an integer basis for h 2(4, r),

and iij =r ci  cj the corresponding intersection matrix. then in cohomology we can

expand

f = f ici , b = bici ,
j = j ici .
m = m ici ,

(3.10)

we note that 2f i are integrally quantized, but bi and j i are not quantized. from the
denition of m , m i = 2(f i + bi). integrating (3.9) then yields

(iklj kj l  iklm km l)k = 2iij m ij j .

(3.11)

if m and j are orthogonal then either they must have the same norm and k is undeter-

mined, or k must be zero.

another way of phrasing the conditions (3.9) is that j + km is a closed (1, 1)-form

such that

(j + km )  (j + km ) = (1 + k2)j  j

(3.12)

9

if we can write j + km = t + i, with  a globally well-dened real scalar and t a

positive (1, 1) form in the cohomology class [j]+k[m ] then (3.12) is just the monge-ampere

equation for , and there is a unique solution [16].

yet another form of the conditions (3.9) for supersymmetry can be obtained by de-

composing m = m  + m + into selfdual and antiselfdual parts. the second equation in

(3.9) then implies m + = j for some scalar . the rst equation can be solved for  as
a function of m  and k (assuming k 6= 0):

 = 

1

k(cid:0)1 p1 + k2(1 + ||m ||2)(cid:1),

(3.13)

where 1

the condition dm = 0, which becomes

(3.14)

to analyze the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry, we follow the conventions

for covariantly constant spinors of [12]. there are two covariantly constant spinors  of
opposite chirality, and conjugate to each other: 

 = +. they are chosen in such a way

that:

m+ = m = 0,

mnp+ = mnp,

(3.15)

where m is a holomorphic coordinate index, m = 1, 2, 3. the spinor space is spanned by

+, , m+ and m. we will also need the following identities:

qmnp+ =

1
2

mnpq,

qmnp+ = (gnmgpq  gnqgpm)+,
mn+ =

mnpgpqq.

(3.16)

we now analyze the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry for the dierent cycles

of dimension p + 1.

10

3.2.1.p = 1

for a one-brane wrapping a two-cycle we can use again (3.2). setting, as in the

previous subsection, 1 = z++ + z and 2 = w++ + w, one nds that (z+/w+) =
ei is a phase, and the equations read

f (j) + im = eip|g + m|p|g|

dx m  dx nmnp = 0,

vol2,

(3.17)(a)

(3.17)(b)

where d denotes the exterior derivative on the worldvolume. in the above equation, and

in similar equations in this section, the x m denote the coordinates of the embedding.

equation (3.17)(b) implies that the cycle is holomorphically embedded. a quick way

to see this is to use local complex coordinates in the static gauge, and normalize 123 = 1.

if we denote by x m the complex coordinates for the threefold, the embedding will be

described by two functions x 2 = x 2(x 1, x 1), x 3 = x 3(x 1, x 1), where we have identied

x 1, x 1 with the complex coordinates on the one-brane worldvolume. the second equation
in (3.17) says that 1x 2 = 1x 3 = 0, and the embedding is holomorphic. therefore, the
two-cycles in threefolds are still holomorphic. this implies that f (j) = vol2, and the other

equation for bps congurations (the rst equation in (3.17)) says that m is a constant

multiple of the volume form:

m = 2(f + f (b)) = tan  vol2.

(3.18)

eld b, the constant tan  is completely determined by integrating the equation (3.18):

f = 2n, and the background

j.

(3.19)

if we x the topology of the chan-paton line bundle: r2
2 z2

2n +z2

f (b) =

tan 

equation (3.18) represents the only deformation of the usual equations in the presence of

b, for p = 1 in a threefold. the content is simply that f

2 is any integral harmonic form

on any holomorphic cycle.

11

3.2.2.p = 2

lets now consider the case of p = 2 (i.e. a d2 brane wrapping a 3-cycle in iia

theory). using the explicit expression (2.6), we nd that the deformed supersymmetry

equation is:



where  = z++ +z. we nd again that (z/z+) = iei is a phase, and the equations
read:

i

p|g + m|

1
3!

(cid:18) + 3m 11(cid:19) = 
f () = eip|g + m|p|g|

f (j) + im = 0.

vol3,

(3.20)

(3.21)(a)

(3.21)(b)

since f (j) is a real dierential form, it follows from the second equation that m = 0, and
one recovers the special lagrangian condition of [12]. hence the possibility of gauge eld

strengths does not lead to new bps congurations.

3.2.3.p = 3

for d3 on a four-cycle, using (3.7), we nd that unbroken supersymmetry requires

(z+/w+) = (z/w) = iei, where  is a constant and

(f (j) + im )  (f (j) + im ) = eip|g + m|p|g|

1
2
f ()  dx qgqr + m  dx m  dx nmnr = 0.

vol4,

(3.22)(a)

(3.22)(b)

we can see that when m = 0, one has  = 0 as well (just by reality of (3.22)) and we

quickly recover the original condition of [12] that the four-cycle is holomorphic.

in fact even when m is nonzero the four-cycle is holomorphic. as before, we can

do the analysis in local complex coordinates. we will assume that the embedding can be
described x 3 = x 3(x 1, x 1, x 2, x 2). at any given point we can always choose a frame
in which the metric has the standard form g = (1/2)p3
i=1(dx i  dx  + dx   dx i),
and  = dx 1  dx 2  dx 3. as our equations only involve rst derivatives, we can work
in this coordinate system, the second equation of (3.22) can be written as
pointwise.

follows:

12

where i = ix 3,  = x 3, i = 1, 2. there is, however, an extra constraint that one
has to fulll: the 2-form m is a real form, and in particular it satises m 
= m11,
11
m 
= m22. if we write these reality conditions using the explicit expressions in (3.23),
22

we nd that the following equation has to be satised:

|1|2 + |2|2 + |1|2|2|2 + |2|2|1|2  2re(1122) = 0.

(3.24)

the sum of the last three terms is greater than or equal to (|1||2|  |2||1|)2, therefore
positive, and it follows then that 1 = 2 = 0. the embedding is holomorphic, and the
four-cycle has to be a divisor.

we can now look at the equations for the gauge eld m . from the last equation in
(3.23) it follows that m 2,0 = 0. if the cycle is holomorphically embedded, (3.22) gives an

equation for the (1, 1) part of m :

f (j)  m = tan (vol4 

1
2

m  m ).

(3.25)

these equations are non-linear deformations of the usual instanton equations m 2,0 =
0, f (j)  m = kvol4, where f (j) is the kahler form on the four-cycle. the bps
conguration we have found is then a divisor in a calabi-yau threefold together with a

deformed instanton on it. notice that the above equations are precisely the equations

(3.9) that one nds for a d3 brane wrapping a manifold of su (2) holonomy. thus, by the

discussion surrounding (3.12) there is a unique solution, as long as the cohomology class
[f (j) + km ] is in the kahler cone of the 4-cycle.

3.2.4.p = 5

if the vebrane wraps the six-cycle itself, we have

p|g|p|g + m|(cid:0)1 +

q gqpvp = 0, hence pmnm mn = 0. but this means that m 2,0 = 0. we can

as in (3.11) the value of the constant  can be determined in terms of the topological data

by integration over the six-cycle.

3.3. g2 holonomy

to analyze the supersymmetry conditions in manifolds of g2 holonomy, we need some
facts about spinors in such manifolds. we will identify the spinors with the octonions o in

the cayley-dickson description: an octonion will be given by a pair of quaternions (a, b),
where a = x8 + x1i + x2j + x3k, and b = x4 + x5i + x6j + x7k. the multiplication rule is
(a, b)(c, d) = (acdb, da+bc), where the overline denotes the usual quaternion conjugation.
an octonion written in this way is imaginary if a is an imaginary quaternion (i.e. if x8 = 0

in the above description). the seven imaginary units are then (i, 0), . . . , (0, k). we can
identify ir7  imo in the obvious way, and cliord multiplication is therefore given by
octonionic multiplication by the imaginary units. the  matrices will be i times the
imaginary units acting through multiplication, in order to have {, } = 2 in at
space. they are then 8  8 imaginary, antisymmetric matrices.

in a manifold of g2 holonomy there is a covariantly constant spinor  which in the
above representation can be taken as (1, 0) (i.e. the unit octonion). a basis for the spinor

space is then given by , ,  = 1, . . . , 7. we also have a calibration , which is a closed
three-form, and the following identities:

 = i,

  = ,

 = ().

(3.29)

we can already analyze the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry in the presence

of born-infeld elds. for a d2 brane, we get the equations:

vol3,

f () = p|g + m|p|g|

m  dx  = 0.
14

(3.30)(a)

(3.30)(b)

the second equation implies m = 0. hence we recover the usual condition for an associa-
tive cycle in a g2 manifold.

the analysis for a d3 brane is similar, and we obtain the following conditions:

f () 
m  dx   dx  = 0.

m  m = p|g + m|p|g|

1
2

vol4,

(3.31)(a)

(3.31)(b)

the equation (3.31)(b) can be interpreted as follows. the 21 of spin(7) decomposes under
g2 as 21 = 14 + 7. (3.31)(b) says that the 2-form m  dx   dx  belongs to the 14.
using the projector of the 21 of spin(7) onto the 7 [17]

p =

1
6

(gg  gg  ()),

we can write (3.31)(b) as

p(m  dx   dx ) = 0.

(3.32)

(3.33)

in the case when the 4-cycle is a coassociative 4-fold the equation (3.33) implies that
m is an anti-self-dual 2-form on the d3 brane worldvolume: m + = 0. this can be easily
proved by working in local coordinates. another proof proceeds as follows. if the cycle is
coassociative then we may replace f () = vol4, and divide through by vol4. we then
square the equation and use

|g + m|

|g|

= 1 

1
2

trm 2 + det m

(3.34)

(here m is an antisymmetric matrix, in local coordinates). then the square of (3.31)(a)
becomes (1  pf(m ))2 = 1  1

2 tr(m 2) + det m so tr(m +)2 = 0.

when a d6 brane wraps a g2 manifold, the conditions for unbroken supersymmetry
give equations for the gauge eld. these will be analyzed in section 4 using the group-

theory approach.

3.4. su(4) holonomy

on a manifold of su (4) holonomy there are two covariantly constant spinors, ,
with the same chirality and complex conjugate to each other. they are chosen in such a
way that m+ = 0. we have the following identities,

mnpq+ = mnpq,

qmnp+ = 3ijq[mnp]+.

(3.35)

the positive chirality spinor space is spanned by +, mn+, and , while the negative
chirality spinor space is spanned by m+, mnp+. supersymmetric cycles in fourfolds
were recently considered in [18].

15

3.4.1.p = 1

for a d1 brane wrapping a 2-cycle in a calabi-yau fourfold, we nd two equations.

the rst one is (3.17)(a), while the second one is

this implies that the cycle is holomorphic. m is constrained in an analogous way to the

dx m  dx n = 0.

(3.36)

su (3) case.

3.4.2.p = 3

for a d3 brane wrapping a four-cycle, the conditions we obtain are more complicated.
set z = ei/2. the analysis of the equations gives w+ = iei/2, w = iei/2, and the
following conditions:

1
2


im(ei(+)/2f ()) = 0,

(f (j) + im )2 + f () = ei(+)/2p|g + m|p|g|
(f (j) + im ) (cid:0)dx n  dx p +

npdx p  dx q(cid:1) = 0.

vol4,

(3.37)(c)

:= ei. to write the last equation, we have used that mn =
where 
 1
pqpq+, with the normalization ||||2 = 16. again, notice that when m = 0
2 mn
the reality of f (j) imposes that  +  = 0. the second equation gives im() = 0 and
the rst equation reads,

1
2



f (j)2 + re(f ()) = vol4,

(3.38)

which is the usual condition for a cayley calibration [15] obtained in this context in [19].

3.4.3.p = 5

finally, we can analyze the deformed equations for a six-cycle in a fourfold.

if we
set z = ei/2, we nd again w+ = iei/2, w = iei/2, and three equations which are
similar to (3.37):

(f (j) + im )3  im  f () = iei(+)/2p|g + m|p|g|

im(m  ei(+)/2f ()) = 0,

(3.39)(c)

where again  := ei. notice that when m = 0 one recovers the usual conditions for
a holomorphic embedding (i.e., the cycle is a divisor).

for a d7 brane wrapping a su (4) manifold, the analysis of the equations along these

lines is more involved. as it will become clear in section 4, one nds a natural generalization

of (3.28) that can be obtained much more easily using the group-theory approach.

3.5. spin(7) holonomy

to analyze the unbroken supersymmetries in manifolds of spin(7) holonomy, we rst

set the relevant spinor algebra. we will regard the spinors of positive or negative chirality
as octonions: s+  s  o. the cliord algebra c8 is represented by

(3.40)

i1,...,8

0

(cid:19)

0

1,...,8 =(cid:18)
ie1,...,8
e1,...,7 = 1,...,7
e8 = 8

where i is the representation of c7 described above, ande1,...,7 is the other inequivalent

representation of c7 (notice that i1,...,7 is given by octonionic multiplication by the
imaginary units). we take 8

a a = ia a. the chirality operator is

 =(cid:18)18

0

0

18(cid:19)

(3.41)

note that (i)t = i, and (i) = i, i = 1, . . . , 8.

we choose the embedding of spin(7) in spin(8) of [17], in which the spinor represen-

tation decomposes as 8s  1 + 7.

in a manifold of spin(7) holonomy there is one covariantly constant spinor, which we

will take of positive chirality. we will denote it by  again, and using the identication
s+  o this spinor can be regarded as the unit octonion. we also have a calibration ,
which in this case is a closed four-form. in terms of the calibration on manifolds of g2

holonomy, we have (in an orthonormal basis):

 =   dx8 + .

(3.42)

notice that this diers from the conventions in [15]. the calibration satises  = .

17

the positive chirality spinor space is spanned by  and  , ,  = 1, . . . , 8. it is
important to notice that the  are not independent: they obey the self-duality condition

  = 

1
6



.

(3.43)

this means that the tensor   in the 28 of spin(8) belongs to the 7 of spin(7). therefore,
only seven components are linearly independent and we nd the right counting of generators
for s+. the generators of s are simply given by ,  = 1, . . . , 8. to analyze the
unbroken supersymmetries we will need the following identity

 = ,

and the expression for the projector 28  7 [17]:

p =

1
8

(gg  gg  ).

(3.44)

(3.45)

we can now analyze a d3 brane wrapping a four-cycle in a manifold of spin(7) holon-

omy. after some straightforward algebra, one nds

1
2

m  m = p|g + m|p|g|

f () 
p(m  dx   dx ) = 0.

vol4,

(3.46)(a)

(3.46)(b)

notice that, for m = 0, we recover the fact a supersymmetric cycle is cayley [19].

in a manner similar to the case of g2 holonomy, in the case when the 4-cycle is
a cayley 4-fold the equation (3.46)b implies that m is an anti- self-dual 2-form on the
d3 brane worldvolume: m + = 0. again, this can be easily proved by working in local

coordinates, or using exactly the same argument as in the g2 case by squaring (3.46)a.

again, the case of the d7 brane wrapping a spin(7) manifold is more involved using

these techniques, and will be considered in section 4.

3.6. a comment on the equations

to write the above conditions for deformed cycles, we have decomposed  =  in the

appropriate basis of the spinor space and we have written the equations that one derives

for the dierent independent elements involved in the equations. for example, (3.17)(a)
gives the piece proportional to +, while (3.17)(b) give the piece proportional to p+.
however, as it has been pointed out in [12][19], to nd solutions of this equation it is

18

enough to solve the equation  = , which usually gives only one equation (as the
inner product with  kills the components which are orthogonal to ). the reason that
these two procedures are equivalent is the following. if we denote p = 1
2 (1  ), we see
from the properties of  that p is an hermitian projector, p 
 = p. the
condition for unbroken supersymmetry can be written as p = 0, but this is equivalent

 = p, p 2

to

(cid:0)p)p = p = 0.

(3.47)

therefore, solving p = 0 is equivalent to solving p = 0. this implies, in particular,
that the additional equations in p = 0 are in fact consequences of p = 0. this
last equation gives the conditions labeled as (a) in this section. for m = 0, they give

the standard denitions of calibrations. the fact that the other equations (labeled as (b)

and (c)) follow from this one is not obvious from a mathematical point of view. in the

m = 0 case, they give additional properties of the calibrated submanifolds. for example,

for p = 1 (3.17)(b) is equivalent to holomorphicity, which in turn is implied by (3.17)(a)

when m = 0. on the other hand, these additional equations can show features which are

not manifest in the main equations (a). this is one of the reasons that we have decided to

spell them out in detail. as we will see in the next section, they can be extremely useful

once the m eld is included. the mathematical meaning of equations (b), (c), at least for

the standard calibrations, is the following: the condition that a submanifold is calibrated

can be stated in terms of a dierential system j, j = 1, . . . , n, where the j are dierential

forms on the ambient space [15]. a submanifold w is calibrated if and only if the forms

j restrict to zero on w . the equations (b), (c) that we have found are in fact part of the

system of equations associated to this dierential system.

as a nal remark, notice the appearance in the deformed equations of the complexied

kahler form, since f (j) + im = f (j + 2ib) + 2if .

3.7. instanton actions

one application of this work is to further study of mirror symmetry. in particular,

in [12] mirror symmetric formulae for sums over d-brane and m-brane instantons were

suggested.

it remains a challenging problem to make these formulae concrete and test

them. one important ingredient in the sums over d-brane instanton corrections are the

instanton actions. it is worth noting that the real part of the instanton actions can easily

19

be derived from the above equations. 6 as an illustration consider the d-instanton eects
in iib string theory on a cy 3-fold. we must consider p = 1, 1, 3, 5. the case p = 1
has not been discussed since it doesnt lead to interesting worldvolume equations. for the

case p = 1 wrapping a 2-cycle w2 we integrate equation (3.17)a and then substitute the
result (3.19) to get:

(3.48)

re(i) = t1s(cid:18)zw2

j(cid:19)2

+(cid:18)zw2

m(cid:19)2

as expected from the tension formula for the sl(2, zz) multiplet of strings. similarly, for

a d3 wrapping a 4-cycle w4 we get, in a similar way

re(i) = t3s(cid:18)zw4

j  m(cid:19)2

+(cid:18)zw4

1
2

j  j 

1
2

m  m(cid:19)2

(3.49)

in accord with the 2-brane and 0-brane charges induced by the chan-paton bundle. finally,

for a d5 wrapping the full calabi-yau 3-fold

re(i) = t5s(cid:18)zw6

1

j 3

2!

jm 2(cid:19)2

+(cid:18)zw6

1
2

j 2m

3!

m 3(cid:19)2

(3.50)

again, this is in accord with the standard formulae for induced d-brane charges from the
chan-paton bundle, to leading order in .

4. group-theoretical basis for the deformed instanton equations

since we have found that the cycles are not deformed, we now consider euclidean
at branes wrapping a submanifold irp+1  {pt}  irp+1  m9p and the deformation of
the instanton equation on them. we will exploit here the fact that the  matrix can be

written in the rotated form (2.9). we want to solve the equation (2.4), where , in the

type iib theory, is a doublet of spinors i, i = 1, 2, and  depends on the born-infeld eld
m . suppose that we nd a covariantly constant spinor  in an irreducible representation

of spin(p + 1) satisfying the equation

1
2

yijij = k,

(4.1)

where k is a constant scalar. then, the equation (2.4) is easily solved by setting 1 = ,
2 = i(p+3)/2ek (where the sign depends on the chirality of ).

6 the imaginary part, by contrast, is a much more subtle quantity, and is discussed in [20][21].

20

the equation (4.1) is a simple equation for unbroken supersymmetry in terms of the

eld y . however, since there is a nonlinear relation between y and m given by (2.14), the

conditions for unbroken supersymmetry of m can be complicated. m on the other hand

obeys the simple relation dm = 0, which is a complicated constraint on y .

some understanding of the relation (4.1) follows simply from group theory. let us

regard the antisymmetric matrix yij (in a local orthonormal frame) as an element of the

lie algebra spin(p+1). the equation (4.1) simply says that the innitesimal rotation by y
preserves  up to a rescaling. let hk  spin(n) be the lie subalgebra stabilizing the one-
dimensional space spanned by . thus elements of hk act on  by a (possibly vanishing)

constant. let h be the orthogonal complement of h in the killing metric. elements in

h rotate  to a nonzero orthogonal spinor. then

spin(n) = hk  h.

(4.2)

the equations (4.1) simply say that y = 0, and yk = constant, in an obvious notation.

now these translate into conditions on (tanhy )k and (tanhy ). the relation between

(tanhy )k and (tanhy ) is complicated in general, although it is constrained by group

theory.

in the following subsections we will analyze the condition (4.1) and the resulting

equations for m , in various dimensions, using this group-theoretic approach.

4.1. p = 3 case and deformed instanton equation in four dimensions

we begin with the case of p = 3 in four-dimensional euclidean space with metric
g =  . the lie algebra so(4) is the representation (3, 1)  (1, 3) of su(2)  su(2).
the choice of spinor singles out the stabilizer subgroup h = (u(1), 0). let y be a 4  4
m=0 amy 2m+1.
(am can be written in terms of bernoulli numbers, but we will not need this.) note that z
is antisymmetric and real. for an antisymmetric matrix, we denote by y = y + + y  the

antisymmetric real matrix. dene z := tanhy by the power series z =p

separation into selfdual and antiselfdual pieces. this is the projection to (3, 1), and (1, 3),

respectively. we claim that:

(tanhy )+

1  pf (tanhy )
21

=

1
2

tanh(2y +)

(4.3)

proof: we rst note that (4.3) is so(4) invariant. for y real antisymmetric there is always
an so(4) rotation that skew diagonalizes it, so y = y12t12 + y34t34, where tij := eij  eji,
and eij are matrix units. then

y + =

1
2

(y12 + y34)(t12 + t34).

(4.4)

in this skew diagonal form one easily checks (4.3) by direct computation. note that if y

is skew diagonal then

tanhy = tan(y12)t12 + tan(y34)t34.

now we use the addition formula for tangents. 

now, the solution to the equations

y ijij = k

(4.5)

(4.6)

where k is a constant and  is of negative chirality, is that y = y + + y  where y + is a
constant in the stabilizer subgroup h = u(1). (this constant can be expressed in terms of
k) while the component y  is an arbitrary function of spacetime. thus, it follows from
(4.3) and m =  tanh(y )7 that

1(f + b)+

1  2pf (f + b)
where we have introduced the parameter

=

1
2

tanh(2y +) = const.,

 =


2 .

(4.7)

(4.8)

the constant in (4.7) is evaluated by going to innity (recall that we are now in
a noncompact situation). as in [5], we will consider congurations in which f  0 at
innity and b is constant, corresponding to localized instantons. this xes the gauge

freedom relating f and b completely, and we obtain:

(f + b)+

pf (f + b)  2 =

b+

pf (b)  2 .

(4.9)

we can now compare this equation with what we found in section 3. in order to do this,

we have to specify the appropriate complex structure. in the complex structure induced

by the reduced holonomy in (3.9) or (3.25), the b eld is a (1, 1) form. therefore, by

choosing a complex structure for (4.9) in which b is also of type (1, 1), we get again (3.8).

7 the factor of  arises because we have kept m xed while scaling the at metric by . this

rescales m by .

4.2. deformation of the hermitian yang-mills equations: p = 5 and p = 7

we will now analyze the equation (4.1) on ir6. this equation says that the innites-
imal rotation by y preserves  up to a constant. the covariantly constant spinor breaks
the local frame group so(6)  su (3) at every point, and chooses a complex structure.
relative to this complex structure we have the deformed equations:

y 2,0 = 0,

j mnymn = k,

(4.10)

where k is a constant.

now we can analyze the meaning of the equations for m/ = tanhy along the lines of
the previous subsection. y is now a 66 antisymmetric matrix. without loss of generality
we can take the local frame components of j to be given by j = t12 + t34 + t56, so that
u (3)  so(6) is dened by {a : aj = ja, a  so(6)}. under this embedding the
antisymmetric rep 15 of so(6) decomposes as:

the matrix y decomposes then as:

15 = 1  3  3  8.

y = y1 + y3 + y3 + y8.

(4.11)

(4.12)

the equations (4.10) say that y3 = y3 = 0 and y1 is a constant times the identity, while
y8 is an arbitrary undetermined function.

the matrix z := tanhy is also real antisymmetric and hence decomposes as z =

z1 + z3 + z3 + z8. the zis are nonlinear functions of the yis. however, if y3 = 0 then
z3 = 0. this follows because in the power series representation of z, if y has zero triality
then z has zero triality. the conclusion of this analysis is that y 2,0 = 0 implies m 2,0 = 0.
thus, most of the 6d hermitian yang mills equations are undeformed.

moreover, if y3 = y3 = 0 then we have the identity:

(tanhy )1  1
2 pf (tanhy )tr(j(tanhy )1)

3 pf (tanhy )j

1  1

=

1
3

tanh(3y1).

(4.13)

the left hand side denes a nonlinear function of m/ = tanhy . evaluating the constant

by going to innity we get a deformation of the 6d hermitian yang-mills equation, which

can be written as follows:

2(f  j 2)/2!  f 3/3!
2j 3/3!  (f 2  j)/2!

2(b  j 2)/2!  b3/3!
2j 3/3!  (b2  j)/2!.

=

23

(4.14)

in this equation, f = f + b, we have assumed that b is of type (1, 1), and we have
used the fact that f 2,0 = 0. notice that all the terms in (4.14) are proportional to the
volume form, j 3/3!, and the quotient of forms should be understood as a quotient of the
corresponding scalars. (4.14) can can also be written as

(cid:20)ej cos(1f )(cid:21)top = (cid:20)ej sin(1b)(cid:21)top
(cid:20)ej sin(1f )(cid:21)top
(cid:20)ej cos(1b)(cid:21)top ,

(4.15)

where the superscript top means that we take the top form in the expansion, which in

complex dimension n has degree 2n. finally, notice that (4.14) agrees with (3.27) (if, as

we explained in the four-dimensional case, b is of type (1, 1)). also notice that the above

deformed equation solves (3.39) provided that the embedding is holomorphic: (3.39)(c)
holds if m 2,0 = 0, and, since f () = 0, (3.39)(a) reduces to (4.14) (for the value of 
xed by the behavior at innity).

equation (4.10) straightforwardly generalizes to the next case p = 7 and further
analysis gives as before m 2,0 = 0 (by virtue of the decomposition under the embedding of
u (4) into so(8): 28 = 1  6  6  15 and four-ality). moreover, we get again (4.15),
where the top form has degree 8. explicitly, we nd:

3(f  j 3)/3!  (f 3  j)/3!

4j 4/4!  2(f 2  j 2)/(2!)2 + f 4/4!

=

3(b  j 3)/3!  (b  j)/3!

4j 4/4!  2(b  j 2)/(2!)2 + b4/4!

.

(4.16)

in a manifold of su (4) holonomy, the equation for the deformed instanton are also m 2,0 =
0 and (4.16), with the only dierence that the constant in the right hand side is evaluated

in terms of the topological data, as in (3.11).

4.3. g2 and spin(7)

as a further application let us consider the possible deformation of the g2-instanton
equations. here y is in the 21 of spin(7) and a nonzero constant spinor  determines an
embedding of g2 into spin(7). for example, from  we get ijk = iijk as in (3.44),
and the g2 subgroup is the subgroup of spin(7) preserving ijk. now y = y7 + y14. the
equations state that y7 = 0. this is equivalent to (tanhy )7 = 0 because tensor products
of the 14 never produce the 7. (one way to see this is to note that weights in the tensor
products of the 14 are always integer sums of root vectors of g2, so one can never produce
the weights of the 7 this way.)

in exactly the same way we nd that the spin(7) equations are undeformed. that is,

the component of m in the 7 of spin(7) is zero.

24

5. relations to noncommutative instanton equations

in this section, we will analyze the deformed instanton equations of the previous

section, focusing on their limiting behavior. in this way we will recover and generalize

some of the results in [5].

in the deformed equations of the previous section there are two parameters,  and

, which are combined into the parameter  dened in (4.8). we now consider several
dierent limiting behaviors. one important limit is to take   0 while keeping  xed
(and therefore   ). this is the usual zero slope limit. another interesting limit is
discussed in [5][22]. in [5], seiberg and witten have shown that the relation of string theory
to noncommutative geometry appears in the double scaling limit   0,   1/2  0.
in this limit (that will be called the seiberg-witten limit),   1/2  0. finally, we can
consider the limit in which the b eld is set to zero. we will now analyze these limits in

the dierent situations that we have considered.

5.1. instanton equation in four dimensions

we will rst analyze the deformed instanton equation (4.9). in the zero slope limit,
  , and we get the usual instanton equation f + = 0. for b = 0, the equation reduces
again to the instanton equation, even for nite . this is in agreement with the observations

in [5], section 2.3. in order to make contact with the deformed instanton equations that
correspond to noncommutative instantons, we have to take the seiberg-witten limit   0.
we nd,

(f + b)+
pf (f + b)

=

b+

pf (b)

,

(5.1)

which is precisely the equation (4.45) of [5]. in fact, our equation (4.9) can be regarded

as a one-parameter deformation of the seiberg-witten equation, where the deformation

parameter is . it is also illuminating to write (4.9) in the open string frame, following the

discussion in [5]. the open string metric in the zero-slope limit is given by:

gij = 

(2)2



(b2)ij,

which can be obtained from the vierbein

e =

(5.5) can be regarded as a two-parameter deformation of the usual instanton equation,

where the parameters are now  and .

one can study spherically symmetric solutions of (5.5) along the lines of equations

(4.56) to (4.62) of [5]. this exercise is subject to the criticism (discussed in [5]) that the
instanton equations are not valid near r  0 because the elds are varying too rapidly
there. one nds a one parameter family of solutions interpolating between h  1/r2 and
h  1/r4. it might be interesting to investigate solutions to the nonabelian generalizations
of these equations, because these might be nonsingular.

5.2. hermitian yang-mills equations

we now study an analogous deformation of the hermitian yang-mills equations using
the equations we have found above for p = 5, 7. first of all, in the zero slope limit   
we recover the ordinary hermitian yang-mills equations, f 2,0 = 0, f  j
2 = 0, as
expected (we assume that b is of type (1, 1)). on the other hand, when b = 0 and  is

p1

nite we do not recover these equations. rather

(cid:20)ej sin(1f )(cid:21)top

= 0,

is still a deformation of hermitian yang-mills. for example, for p = 5 we nd

2 j 2

2!  f 

1
3!

f 3 = 0.

26

(5.7)

(5.8)

if the reasoning of [5] extends to this case, then we should have a one-to-one correspondence

between solutions of (5.7) and solutions of the usual hermitian yang-mills equations in six

dimensions.

in the seiberg-witten limit   0 we get the equations:

b

p1

2  j
pf (b)

=

p1

f
2  j
pf (f )
f 2,0 = 0.

(5.9)(a)

(5.9)(b)

using that 

p+1

obtain:

p1

2  j = pf()tr(j1), where  is a (1, 1) form, we

tr"j(cid:18) 1

f + b 

1

b(cid:19)# = 0.

(5.10)

to compare with the non-commutative ym equations we should go to the open string

frame and recall that, ignoring the terms involving derivatives in f , one has [5]:

f =

1

1 + f 

f = b(cid:18) 1

b + f 

1

b(cid:19)b,

(5.11)

where f is the eld strength in the non-commutative geometry dened in [5]. using the

vierbein (5.3), we see that the equation (5.10) is equivalent to

tr(jg f ) = 0.

(5.12)

therefore, recalling that b is of type (1, 1), we arrive at the non-commutative hermitian

yang-mills equations:

f 2,0 = 0,

f  j

p1

2 = 0.

(5.13)

it should be stressed that the formulae mapping to noncommutative yang-mills theory

used above apply to constant eldstrengths f of rank one, and moreover to backgrounds

with constant b. nevertheless, our bps conditions apply to nonconstant b and f , and

admit natural nonabelian generalizations, so it would be nice to establish the equivalence

between (5.9)a,b and (5.13) in the more general setting. in particular, it would be inter-
esting to see if there is still a map to the noncommutative geometry dened using the 
product of [23].

27

6. relations to previously studied nonlinear deformations of the instanton

equations

the nonlinear deformations of instanton equations we have found from -symmetry

and bps conditions are closely related to some nonlinear instanton equations which have

been previously studied.

first, the equation (4.15) has some similarities to the nonlinear deformations of the

hermitian yang-mills equations studied in [7]. leung introduced his equations to study the

relation of gieseker and mumford stability of holomorphic vector bundles. among leungs

results are some results that suggest that there should be a 1-1 correspondence between

the solutions of the deformed and undeformed equations. this is certainly consistent with

the change of variables discussed by seiberg and witten. indeed, it suggests that their

change of variables might be useful in studying stability of holomorphic vector bundles.

second, it is worth pointing out that the equations (5.8) together with f 2,0 = 0 are
just the equations of motion of the chiral cocycle theories studied by losev et. al. in [8].

these are theories of type (1, 1) connections on holomorphic bundles governed by actions
formed from bott-chern classes. the chiral cocycle lagrangians ln exist for complex
manifolds xn of any complex dimension n. they are constructed using bott-chern forms
and are functionals of a gauge eld a satisfying f 0,2 = 0. they have equation of motion:

where a0,1 = gg1 and g  gl(n,c). therefore, using the lagrangian

for suitable coecients ak we can reproduce equations (4.15) above and their limits
(5.7)(5.9). this connection is potentially useful because, as discussed at length in [8],

the theories are partially solvable using higher dimensional current algebra and higher di-

mensional analogues of the bc-systems of 2d conformal eld theory. one wonders if the

higher-dimensional fermionization described in [8] could be useful in this regime of string

theory.

moreover, the equations of [7] and of [8] both admit natural nonabelian generalizations.

the correct formulation of a nonabelian born-infeld theory is a problem which has been

partially, but not fully solved [24]. one also wonders if the nonabelian chiral cocycle

equations will be the equations for bps congurations of nonabelian born-infeld theories.

if this is the case then the connection could be very rich for mathematical physics, providing

natural nonlinear deformations of yang-mills-higgs systems.

7. kodaira-spencer theory and the m5-brane

the above analysis can also be applied to the -symmetries of the m 2 and m 5 branes.

in the case of the m 2 brane, the analysis has already been done in [12]. since the only

worldvolume elds are scalars there is no nontrivial rotation of the  operator. this is

consistent with the fact that we found no interesting deformations for the case of d1 and

d2 branes.

the situation for the m5 brane, on the other hand, is much more nontrivial. su-

persymmetric congurations on the m5 brane have been studied in [25][26][27]. here we

focus on m5 instantons with none of the 5 normal bundle scalars activated. since we are

working with instantons we must decide on a formulation of the 5brane theory, as well as a

continuation of that theory to euclidean space. since we are interested in on-shell congu-

rations we restrict attention to the purely on-shell and covariant formulation of [9][11]. in

this theory one uses a self-dual 3-form h nonlinearly related to the eld strength of the
2-form potential, h. the latter eldstrength satises the bianchi identity dh  f (g4)
where g4 is the m -theory 4-form eldstrength.

in the formulation of [11] one begins (in minkowski space) with a real self-dual 3-form

h = h. the nonlinear equation of motion for h is

mh = 0

m 

 =  

  2hh.

(7.1)

the  operator dening -symmetry transformations is simply given by

 = (0)(1 

1
2  3!

h).

the crucial nonlinear relation of h to the eldstrength h of the 2-form potential is, ac-

cording to [11], given by

h = (m1) 

 h.

(7.2)

while h satises a simple bianchi identity dh = 0 (in a background with g4 = 0)
the self-duality condition and the  operator are complicated nonlinear functions of h.

indeed, we will regard the relation of h to h as quite analogous to that between y and

m , explored extensively in the previous sections.

in particular, we have learned from

our previous results that, while the equations for supersymmetric brane congurations are

complicated nonlinear equations on m , they become much simpler in terms of y . an

analogous phenomenon proves to be the case in the m5 theory.

29

accordingly, let us examine the conditions on h for a supersymmetric m5 instanton.

we will continue to euclidean space by relaxing the reality condition on h and taking

h = ih.

(7.3)

on a kahler manifold this implies that h is of the form h = h3,0 + h2,1 + h1,2 where h2,1
is in the image of j and h1,2 is in the kernel of j. we take the equation of motion on
a curved euclidean manifold x to be:

mh = 0.

this implies dh = 0 [11]. finally, we can continue  to euclidean space by taking

1
2  3!
the condition (7.3) on h guarantees that 2 = 1.

 = i(0)(1 

h).

(7.4)

(7.5)

we now take x to be a calabi-yau 3-fold and look for on-shell eld congurations h

such that there are covariantly constant spinors with  = . choosing the lower sign in

(7.5) we nd no condition on h. choosing the upper sign we nd the general solution

h = c + 1,2

(7.6)

where c is a constant, 1,2 is of type (1, 2), and j  1,2 = 0, or equivalently gmn1,2
it is now useful to dene the variable

mnp = 0.

the condition j  1,2 = 0 implies

m

n :=

1
2

mpqnpq.

mn = nm.

(7.7)

(7.8)

now we examine the implications of (7.4). this equation has (2, 0), (1, 1), and (0, 2)
components. we nd that the (2, 0) component is identically satised thanks to  = 0.
the (0, 2) component becomes

gmnnmpq  4n
rsmrsnmpq = 0
30

(7.9)

which is a deformation of the standard gauge xing condition 1,2 = 0 of kodaira-
spencer theory, where  : 1,2  0,2. finally, using (7.8) repeatedly the (1, 1) compo-
nent of (7.4) becomes precisely the kodaira-spencer equation

[mn]

p  8c[m

qq p

n] = 0,

(7.10)

for a nite deformation  of the complex structure on x, as long as c 6= 0.

the problem we face at this point is that our three equations for  (or ), (7.8)(7.9)

and (7.10), are potentially overdetermined, hence it is not clear that they have solutions.

we conjecture that solutions in fact do exist, and that on a calabi-yau manifold they are in

one to one correspondence with the solutions to the standard kodaira-spencer equations.

we will now give some partial evidence for this.

the kodaira-spencer equation has been explicitly solved on a calabi-yau manifold

by tian and todorov in [28][29]. the rst step in doing this is to set up a perturbative

procedure to solve the equation. we start from the ansatz:

 =

xn=1

n(n),

(7.11)

where  is a formal parameter. we will denote by  : (p,0)(qt x)  (p,3q) the con-
traction with , so that  = . making a convenient choice of c, the kodaira-spencer
equation at nth order is given by:

(n) +

1
2

nxi=1

[(i), (ni)] = 0.

(7.12)

the resulting equations can be recursively solved in the gauge  = 0. we will denote a
solution in this gauge by t t . at rst order, one nds that (1)
t t is harmonic. at second
order, and using that [a, b] = (a  b), the solution is given by:

t t =  1
(2)

2

((1)

t t  (1)

t t ).

one can in fact nd an explicit solution t t , constructed in a recursive way, which satises
the gauge condition t t = 0 and also t t = 0. this solution is given, at nth order,
by [28][29]:

t t =  1
(n)

2

((i)

t t  (ni)

t t

),

(7.13)

nxi=1

31

and (1)
t t is any harmonic (1, 2) form in the calabi-yau. a remarkable fact is that this
solution satises automatically the extra equation (7.8), or equivalently, j  t t = 0.
this can be proved inductively as follows: consider the (2, 3)-form j  (1)
t t is
harmonic, using the hodge identity [j, ] = i we can easily prove that this (2, 3)-form
is also harmonic. but h2,3 = 0 on a calabi-yau, so j  (1)
t t = 0. this proves (7.8) at rst
order. lets now assume that j  (i)

t t = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n  1. then

t t . since (1)

) is easily seen to be zero after using the denition of  and the

our equations involve the deformed gauge condition (7.9) rather than the one used

in the proof of the tian-todorov theorem. since we are just changing the gauge, we can
try to nd a solution to our equations of the form (n) = (n)
t t is the
explicit solution (7.13), and in such a way that (7.8) is still true. the rst step in doing

t t + (n), where (n)

this is to rewrite (7.9) as follows. we introduce the determinant of , that we will denote
by det  := deti,j  j

. if we choose ||||2 = 1, we nd that (7.9) can be written as

i

(7.15)

(7.16)

we can also write (7.15) as

where f =  1
is just given by (n)
in . at third order, the gauge xing condition becomes:

8c log[1 + 64c(det )]. at rst and second order, the solution to our equations
t t , n = 1, 2, since the deformation of the gauge xing condition is cubic

((3))pq = ((3))pq = (



(f (3)))pq,

(7.17)

where f (3) is the third order term in  (and in fact involves only (1)). a change of gauge
at third order simply means that (3) = , where  is a (0, 2) form that satises:

we can then write

 = 



(f (3)).





(f (3)),

(3) =

32

(7.18)

(7.19)

and it is easy to check (using again the hodge identities) that j  (3) = 0. therefore,
the perturbation of the solution (7.13) induced by the deformation of the gauge condition

preserves (7.8) at third order. unfortunately, the procedure becomes cumbersome for

higher orders and we have not been able to check it for the next terms in the perturbative

series. we conjecture, however, that the equations with the new gauge xing condition

can be solved in the way that we have sketched. (in arranging a full proof it might help

to notice that the right hand side of (7.15) involves the deformed holomorphic derivative
k  8ckmm.) in particular, we conjecture that the solutions to our equations are in
one to one correspondence with the solutions to the kodaira-spencer equation with the

usual gauge xing, and in such a way that (7.8) is satised.

our result is relevant to the problem of computing nonperturbative corrections for

m -theory on a calabi-yau. these will involve a weighted sum over all congurations of

wrapped vebranes with supersymmetric h elds turned on. the preceding relates such

h elds to points in the moduli space of complex structures on the calabi-yau. h is

subject to a quantization condition which restricts the sum to rational points reminiscent

of those arising from the attractor equations [30,31].

our result also establishes a very direct relation between the m5-brane and kodaira-

spencer theory. connections between the m5 theory and kodaira-spencer theory have

been discussed before. in particular, in [32] witten related the quantization of the phase
space h 3(x) to kodaira-spencer theory and the holomorphic anomaly equation [33]. (see
[29] for some recent progress.) in [34] witten then connected the quantization of h 3(x)

to the m5 theory. closely related connections have been explored in [35]. nevertheless, we

believe the above connection is new. we hope it leads to further progress in demystifying

the m -theory vebrane.
