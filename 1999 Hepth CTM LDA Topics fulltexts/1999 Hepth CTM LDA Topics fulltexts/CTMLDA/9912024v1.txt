abstract

vacuum spherically symmetric einstein gravity in n  4 dimensions can be cast
in a two-dimensional conformal nonlinear sigma model form by rst integrating on the
(n  2)-dimensional (hyper)sphere and then performing a canonical transformation.
the conformal sigma model is described by two elds which are related to the arnowitt-
deser-misner mass and to the radius of the (n  2)-dimensional (hyper)sphere, respec-
tively. by quantizing perturbatively the theory we estimate the quantum corrections
to the adm mass of a black hole.

1 introduction

classically, a neutral, non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole in vacuum is completely
identied by the value of its (adm) mass madm (see e.g. [1]). since gravity does not couple
to any matter eld  and we impose ab initio spherical symmetry  madm is constant and
the geometry possesses one extra killing vector in addition to the killing vectors which are
associated to the spherical symmetry (birkho theorem). the general solution of einstein
equations is the famous schwarzschild metric. it describes an eternal black hole.

naively, we would expect both properties  the birkho theorem and madm = constant
 to be broken at quantum level. the validity of the birkho theorem in the quantum
canonical theory of spherically symmetric gravity has been investigated in refs. [2, 3, 4]. it
has been shown that the birkho theorem holds at quantum level, i.e. the quantum theory
of spherically symmetric gravity in vacuum is a quantum mechanical system with a nite
number of degrees of freedom (quantum birkho theorem) [2]. moreover, the hilbert space
of the quantum theory is completely determined by the eigenstates of the (gauge invariant)
mass operator.

the aim of this paper is to explore whether the other classical property (madm =
constant) holds in the quantum gravity regime as well. the result of our investigation is
that quantum gravity corrections to the schwarzschild mass appear at the second order in
the curvature perturbative expansion. for instance, quantum uctuations of the mass of a
four-dimensional black hole are, for distances much greater than the horizon radius,

r!2
madm < mpl  lpl

,

(1)

where lpl and mpl are the planck length and the planck mass, respectively (notations: here
and throughout the paper we use natural units.)

a number of approximations are needed to obtain eq. (1). we will discuss them in detail
in the following sections. here let us just emphasize two important points concerning eq.
(1). firstly, the quantum theory breaks down on the horizon(s) where the coupling constants
of the perturbative expansion diverge. therefore, eq. (1) is strictly valid for distances much
greater than the schwarzschild radius of the black hole. secondly, quantum uctuations
vanish for large radii, i.e. at large distances from the black hole. in the asymptotic regime
the black hole behaves classically and the mass is constant. quantum uctuations of the
schwarzschild mass due to pure quantum gravity eects become manifest when the black
hole horizon is approached.

equation (1) is obtained in the context of the nonlinear sigma model approach to
spherically symmetric gravity whose basic ingredients are described in ref. [2]. firstly,
n-dimensional spherically symmetric gravity is cast in a dilaton gravity form by integrating
over the (n  2) spherical coordinates. then, by a canonical eld redenition the action

2

is transformed in a two-dimensional conformal nonlinear sigma model with a xed target
metric. the new elds are the dilaton and a gauge invariant eld m which is constant on
the classical solutions of the eld equations and can be identied with the adm mass of the
black hole.

the new action can be quantized perturbatively by expanding the metric of the target
space in normal riemann coordinates [5]. since the expansion parameter is proportional to
the curvature of the manifold, the theory is a free eld theory far away from the black hole
horizon and for large adm mass in planck units. the perturbative theory turns out to be
infrared and ultraviolet divergent. infrared divergences are eliminated by the introduction
of an infrared regulator m. the theory is regularized by usual dimensional regularization
techniques. the consistency of the procedure is veried a posteriori by calculating the one-
loop -function. the theory becomes asymptotically free at large energy scales, where the
perturbative regime is valid and the infrared regulator can be neglected.

the amplitude of the quantum uctuations of the adm mass at a given order in the
perturbative expansion can be read straightforwardly from the two-point green functions of
the theory. this is possible because the nonlinear sigma model elds are the adm mass and
the dilaton. since the elds have a direct geometrical meaning any problem related to their
interpretation in terms of physical quantities disappears.

the outline of the paper is as follows. in the next section we illustrate the classical theory
of n-dimensional (n  4) spherically symmetric gravity. we start with the dilaton gravity
description and then introduce the nonlinear sigma model picture. although a part of this
section reviews previous work (see [2] and references therein), its content is useful to make
the paper self-contained. sections 3 and 4 are devoted to the classical expansion in normal
riemann coordinates and to the perturbative quantization of the theory, respectively. (the
evaluation of the relevant feynman diagrams is briey outlined in appendix.) finally, in
section 5 we state our conclusions.

2 classical theory

it is well known [6, 7, 8, 9] that for spherically symmetric metrics the n-dimensional einstein-
hilbert action (the ricci tensor is dened as in [10])

s(n ) =

1

16ln 2

pl

z dn y g r(n )(g)

(2)

can be cast, upon integration on the n  2 spherical coordinates, in the dilaton gravity form

sdg = z d2xg "r(2)(g) 

d
d

ln[w ()]()2 + v ()# ,

(3)

3

where the dilaton eld is related to the radius of the (n  2)-dimensional sphere and w ()
and v () are given functions whose form depends on the n-dimensional metric ansatz.
(we neglect surface terms as they are irrelevant for the following discussion. for a detailed
discussion about the role of boundary terms see e.g. [2, 11, 12] and references therein.)

theories of the form (3) admit the existence of the (gauge invariant) quantity [2, 13]

m = n()  w ()()2 , n() = z 

d[w ()v ()]

which is locally conserved, i.e.

m = 0 .

(4)

(5)

equation (5) can be easily proved by dierentiating eq. (4) and using the eld equations

d

= 0 .

gv () +

ln[w ()][()

g()2] = 0 ,

(6)

(7)

a further property of m is conformal (weyl) invariance [14]. indeed, by rescaling the two-
dimensional metric [15]

v () and w () transform as

g(x)  g(x) a() ,

v ()  v () /a() ,
w ()  w () a() .

(8)

(9)

equation (4) is clearly invariant under (8)-(9). using eqs. (8)-(9), the action (3) can be
cast in a simpler form by a suitable choice of a(). here and throughout the paper we
will set a() = 1/w () which corresponds to choosing the spherically symmetric ansatz
(,  = 0, . . . n  1, ,  = 0, 1) [9]

with this choice w ()  1 and the dilaton gravity action (3) becomes

where

sdg = z d2xg h r(2)(g) + v ()i ,

(13)

this property will be essential in the following.

the dilaton gravity action (3) can be cast in a nonlinear conformal sigma model form.

where  is an arbitrary, non-constant, function of the coordinates. equation (14) can be
easily checked using conformal coordinates. since eq. (14) is a generally covariant expression,
and any two-dimensional metric can be locally cast in the conformal form by a coordinate
transformation [16], eq. (14) is valid in any system of coordinates.

dierentiating eq. (4), and using eq. (14) with  = , the action (3) can be written as

a functional of m and . the result is

s = z

where s is the surface term

s = 2z

(16)

let us investigate the classical solutions of eq. (15). varying eq. (15) with respect to m
and  we nd

  v () = 0 ,

equations (17) and (18) must be complemented by the constraints

(17)
(18)

(19)

which are obtained by varying eq. (15) with respect to the metric g. the general solution
of eqs. (17)-(19) can be easily obtained using conformal coordinates. setting

g = (cid:18) 0 1

u um = 0 ,

v vm = 0 .

(21)

from eqs. (21) and (12) it follows that m is constant, m = m0. using eq. (21) and (4)
the general solution can be written

m = m0 ,

where  = u(u) + v (v), u and v being arbitrary functions.
(the arbitrariness in the
choice of  reects the residual coordinate reparametrization invariance in the conformal
gauge. given u and v correspond to a particular choice of conformal coordinates.) the
two-dimensional metric is

ds2 = 4[n()  m0]uvdudv

= 4[n()  m0]dudv ,

or, using the coordinates [  (u + v ), t  u  v ],

ds2 = [n()  m0]dt 2 + [n()  m0]1d2 .

(23)

(24)

the general solution depends on the single variable . this result is usually known as the
generalized birkho theorem (see e.g. [13, 17, 18, 19]). finally, substituting (12) in eq.
(24) and using (10) we have

ds2

(26)

let us conclude this section with a couple of remarks. we have seen that two-dimensional
dilaton gravity can be described by a two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model with a given
target space metric. in particular, for n-dimensional spherically symmetric gravity the elds

6

appearing in the conformal sigma model are the dilaton and the adm mass, i.e. quantities
which have a direct physical interpretation. the description of spherically symmetric gravity
in terms of geometrical variables is essential for the quantization of the model since the
quantum elds can be directly related to the original spacetime geometry and problems
related to their interpretation do not show up. the equivalence between the nonlinear sigma
model action (15) and the dilaton gravity action (11) can be proved at the canonical level
as well. this has been done in ref. [2]. the general canonical transformation includes,
as particular cases, the canonical transformations discussed in ref. [20] for the cghs [21]
model and ref. [12] for the four-dimensional black hole.

3 sigma model curvature expansion

the nonlinear sigma model (15) can be quantized perturbatively by expanding the target
space metric in riemann normal coordinates [5]. let us dene the adimensional mass m =
2/(n 2)m. the bulk term of the action (15) in the conformal gauge can be cast in the form
[  (u, v)]

s = z d2 gij(x)x ix j ,
where x 0  m, x 1   and the metric of the target space is

(27)

gij(x) =

1

n (x 1)  x 0 (cid:18) 0

1/2

1/2

0 (cid:19) ,

n (x 1) = 2/(n 2)n() .

(28)

now we expand the target metric (28) in riemann normal coordinates around a point x(0)
(vacuum expectation value). at the second order in the riemann expansion the metric is
[22]

gij(x) = gij[x(0)]

where x i = x i(0) + xi, xi  x i. using eq. (28) and substituting eq. (29) in eq. (27) the
action at the second order in the riemann expansion is

as expected, the riemann expansion is an expansion in powers of the curvature, i.e. in
powers of lpl/r. the theory becomes free in the asymptotically at region where the rst

order correction to the free theory is of order o(cid:16)(lpl/r)n 2(cid:17). the perturbative expansion
fails on the black hole horizon, the coupling constants g and g blowing up when rn 3  j.
the perturbative riemann expansion is also valid for large values of madm /mpl at distances

(39)

and the riemann expansion is an expansion in powers of mpl/madm . the theory becomes
a free eld theory when mpl/madm  1.

4 perturbative quantization

in this section we quantize the theory at one-loop and at the rst order in the curvature
expansion (g = g = 0). since the target space is not ricci-at, the conformal symmetry is
not preserved at the quantum level. conformal symmetry breaking implies running coupling
constants and eective terms in the action that depend on the conformal factor. since
quantum corrections to the adm mass due to these terms are subdominant we will postpone
their discussion at the end of the section and work in the unit gauge.

the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude is (for notations see ref. [23])

w [j] = n z d[yi] eis[y,j] ,

s[y, j] = z d2 [l + jiyi] .

a3 = 8[q(p1  p2)][q(p3  p4)] .
the two- and four-point green functions (44) and (46) are infrared and ultraviolet divergent.
the infrared divergence can be eliminated by inserting a infrared regulator. we will check a
posteriori the consistency of this procedure by proving that the theory is asymptotically free
in the ultraviolet region, i.e. that the theory is perturbative for large values of the energy.
in order to regularize the theory we have to compute the ultraviolet divergences. using
dimensional regularization the divergence of the two-point green function (44) is (details of
the calculation are given in appendix)

now we can calculate the -function and the anomalous dimension (g) of the y elds at

(56)

where gs is the value of the coupling constant g at the renormalization scale s. from eq. (56)
we see that g  0 for   , i.e. the theory becomes free at high energy scales (asymptotic
freedom). the perturbative regime of the theory is realized at short distances, where the
theory itself exhibits an ultraviolet stable xed point. since the model is asymptotically
free in the ultraviolet region, it is possible to neglect the dependence of the green functions
on the infrared regulator. solving the renormalization group equation at one-loop for the
n-point green function, we obtain

< y1y2 . . . yn ; g,  >=   g

(58)

(59)

11

as a result, at the rst order in the curvature expansion, the one-loop quantum correction
to the schwarzschild mass is identically zero

< m(1) m(2) > = o(g2) .

(60)

actually, a simple observation shows that the two-point green function at rst order in
the curvature expansion is zero at any loop. this result follows from the invariance of the
interaction lagrangian density, eq. (42), under poincare group transformations in the y eld
space. since the interaction vertex (43) has two m and two  legs, and the propagator
is anti-diagonal in the elds (m, ), any two-point green function is necessarily diagonal
[antidiagonal] in the yi [m, ] elds, respectively.

let us now consider the perturbative potential at second order in the curvature expansion

v2(y) =

1
2

ggijklaqyiykyjylyq .

(61)

this interaction breaks the poincar`e invariance in the y eld space. we have two dierent
vertices:











g

g

(62)









where g2  ggg.

since v2(y) is an odd functional of the y elds we expect the interaction lagrangian
density (61) to give a non-vanishing two-loop contribution to the one-point green function
< m >



g

2

(63)

however, a straightforward computation of this diagram shows that < m > is identically
zero. the rst non-vanishing two-point green function for the m eld at the second order
in the curvature expansion is given by the feynman diagram

g
2

g
2





(64)

the above diagram gives a non-diagonal logaritmic divergence to the propagator of the y
elds. by adding the appropriate counterterm in the lagrangian, the rst nite, non-zero,
two point green function for the m eld is

< m(1) m(2) >=

a ln(cid:18) 

m(cid:19) (1 + bg2)(gg)2 ln[(1  2)2] ,

(65)

12

where a, b are constant adimensional factors.

using eq. (65) we can estimate the upper limit of the quantum corrections of madm .

since the perturbative expansion fails when g ln()  o(1) from eq. (65) we have

(madm )2 < m2

pl |(1 + bg2) g g2| .

(66)

(67)

(68)

recalling eqs. (37)and (39) we obtain

madm < mpl(cid:18) mpl

for r/lpl  1 and mpl/madm  1, respectively.

up to now we have neglected eective terms due to the dependence of the action on
the conformal factor in d = 2   dimensions. equations (67) and (68) make sense only if
the contributions due to these terms are subleading. this is indeed the case, as we have
anticipated at the beginning of this section.

in the conformal gauge the one-loop renormalized sigma-model action at the second order

in the curvature expansion is

5 conclusion

let us summarize the main results of the paper. n-dimensional spherically symmetric grav-
ity in vacuo can be reduced to a two-dimensional conformal nonlinear sigma model form,
eq. (27). the eld content of the latter is given by two elds, m() and (). the m
eld is constant on the classical solutions of the eld equations. it coincides, apart from a
constant factor, to the adm mass of the system. the second eld, , is related to the radius
of the (n  2)-dimensional (hyper)sphere [see eqs. (25) and (26)]. so both elds have a
direct physical meaning. this property makes the conformal nonlinear sigma model formu-
lation very attactive. quantization of the theory in the (m, ) representation gives quantum
corrections to the mass and to the radius in a direct and straightforward way. this result
cannot be achieved in the usual einstein [eq. (2)] or dilaton gravity [eq. (3)] approaches.

the perturbative quantization of the theory is straightforward. firstly, the nonlinear
sigma model target space is expanded in riemann normal coordinates, i.e. in powers of the
target space curvature. then the theory is quantized  at any order  by usual quantum
eld theory techniques. the perturbative expansion fails on the black hole horizon(s) where
the target space metric exhibits a singularity. this is not surprising: on the horizon(s)
strong quantum gravity eects manifest themselves and a perturbative quantization must
necessarily fail. conversely, far away from the horizon(s) quantum gravity eects are weak,
the sigma model target space is asymptotically at and a perturbative treatment is possible.
[the perturbative results hold also at distances of the order of the horizon(s) for black holes
with large mass in planck units  see eq. (38).]

in this paper we have discussed rst and second order corrections in the curvature ex-
pansion. surprisingly, rst order corrections to the adm mass are identically zero at any
loop. this follows from the invariance of the rst order interaction under poincar`e transfor-
mations in the (m, ) eld space and from the antidiagonal form of the eld propagator.
therefore, quantum corrections to the adm mass of a four-dimensional black hole are not of
order madm  r1, as one would naively expect. the rst nonzero quantum corrections
to madm arise (at least) at second order in the curvature expansion [see eq. (67) and (68)].

equations (67) and (68) are the main contribution of the paper. pure quantum gravity
eects make the classical adm mass of a spherically symmetric black hole uctuate according
to eqs. (67) and (68). hopefully, this result may help to shed light on open issues in quantum
gravity and black hole physics, such as information loss, black hole thermodynamics and
black hole evaporation.

appendix

in this appendix we sketch the evaluation of the feynman diagrams (44) and (46). the
integrals are evaluated by dimensional regularization.

two-point green function

by dimensional regularization the calculation of the one-loop two-point green function (44)
is reduced to the evaluation of the (euclidean) integral in d = 2   dimensions

2 = z d2q

where we have added a regulator m2 to avoid the infrared divergence at q = 0.
indeed,
discarding the ultraviolet quadratically divergent integral (see e.g. [24]) and wick rotating
to the euclidean space (see fig. 1, eq. (45)) can be written

the integral (73) can be immediately evaluated (see [23], eq. (b.16), p. 317). the result is
