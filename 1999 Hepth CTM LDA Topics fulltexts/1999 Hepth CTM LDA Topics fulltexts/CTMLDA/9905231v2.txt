abstract

according to the positive energy conjecture of horowitz and my-
ers, there is a specic supergravity solution, ads soliton, which has
minimum energy among all asymptotically locally ads solutions with
the same boundary conditions. related to the issue of semiclassical
stability of ads soliton in the context of pure gravity with a negative
cosmological constant, physical boundary conditions are determined
for an instanton solution which would be responsible for vacuum de-
cay by barrier penetration. certain geometric properties of instantons
are studied, using hermitian dierential operators. on a d-dimensional
instanton, it is shown that there are d  2 harmonic functions. a class
of instanton solutions, obeying more restrictive boundary conditions,
is proved to have d  1 killing vectors which also commute. all but
one of the killing vectors are duals of harmonic one-forms, which are
gradients of harmonic functions, and do not have any xed points.

introduction

like for any other eld theory, positivity of the energy is a necessary condition for

ensuring the stability of general relativity. in the presence of gravity, although the

notion of local energy density is not well dened, one can still talk about the total

energy of a gravitating system dened in terms of the asymptotic behavior of the

metric with respect to a background geometry [1],[2]. for asymptotically at spaces,

under general assumptions, the complete proof of positive energy theorem was rst

given in [3]. later, a simple and elegant proof was presented in [4], using spinors. on

the other hand, it is known that there are non-trivial zero [5] and negative energy

[6] asymptotically at spaces on which these proofs do not apply. generically, such
a solution has an asymptotic circle s1 which is contractible in the interior, thus the
asymptotic geometry is only locally minkowskian. the proof of [3] does not apply

due to this topological dierence, and spinors used in the proof given in [4] are not

well dened on such spaces [5]. this sector of the theory is completely unstable.

following the remarkable conjecture of [7],[8],[9], there is now considerable evi-

dence for a correspondence between certain string theories on anti-de-sitter (ads)

spaces and conformal eld theories (cft) living on the boundaries of these spaces.

for some applications, the correspondence allows us to work with supergravity ap-

proximations to string theories. although supersymmetry plays a crucial role for the

conjecture, in [10], it has been suggested that non-supersymmetric yang-mills gauge

theory can also be described by ads/cft correspondence by compactifying one direc-
tion on s1 and imposing supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions to fermions.
recently, horowitz and myers have studied the consequences of this proposal from

the point of view of supergravity theory on ads [11]. by ads/cft correspondence,
one should consider geometries which have one spatial direction compactied on s1
asymptotically. thus, the asymptotic geometry is not globally but only locally the

ads space. the standard techniques can be applied to show the positivity of energy

for spaces which approach globally to ads at innity [12]. however, the stability of

gravity is now questionable with this new asymptotic form, like in the asymptotically

locally minkowskian sector. indeed, horowitz and myers presented a solution which

is completely regular and has negative total energy. following horowitz and myers,

we will also refer to this solution as ads soliton. not surprisingly, the topology of

ads soliton is such that the asymptotic circle at innity is contractible in the interior.

horowitz and myers have beautifully identied the negative energy of this solution

2

with the negative casimir energy of the eld theory which arises due to the breaking

of supersymmetry. then, the expected stability of non-supersymmetric yang-mills

gauge theory led them to conjecture a new positive energy theorem for asymptotically

locally ads spaces.

perturbative stability of ads soliton (up to quadratic metric uctuations) has

been shown in [11]. a related and important problem is the issue of semiclassical sta-

bility. in eld theory, a false vacuum decay by barrier penetration to a stable ground

state via instanton like solutions of euclidean eld equations, in which at large dis-

tances the elds take their values in the false vacuum [13]. therefore, one should

study the possible euclidean metric solutions of einstein equations which approach

the euclidean ads soliton (which will also be referred as ads soliton) asymptotically.

the existence of such a solution (which will be referred simply as an instanton) may

then imply the instability of the ads soliton as a result of a semiclassical analysis (i.e.

studying the small uctuations around the instanton). with the above motivation, in

this paper, we will try to determine some geometric properties of instanton solutions

by studying certain dierential operators. similar arguments were rst used to show

the semiclassical stability of minkowski space in [4].

the organization of the paper is as follows. in section 2, we discuss the denition

of the euclidean action, which can be expressed as a surface integral when being

evaluated on a background, and x the asymptotic behavior of the metric. in section

3, we introduce two hermitian dierential operators dened on divergence free vec-

tor elds, and determine their zero modes. one of the operators has no zero modes

and turns out to be invertible. we also study the properties of the laplacian acting

on square integrable functions. in section 4, by solving dirichlet problems related

to the invertible dierential operators introduced in section 3, we try to prove that

an instanton has certain number of harmonic functions and commuting killing vec-

tors. we solve the dirichlet problem related to the laplacian and show that on a
d-dimensional instanton there are d  2 harmonic functions. the dirichlet problem,
which is intimately related to the existence of killing vectors, can be solved in six

or higher dimensional instantons. however, that solution does not have appropriate

asymptotics to give the desired killing vectors. then, we focus on a family of instan-

tons obeying more restrictive boundary conditions. on a d-dimensional instanton of
this family, we show that there are d  1 commuting killing vectors.
that all but one of the killing vectors are duals of harmonic one-forms, which are

it turns out

gradients of harmonic functions, and do not have any xed points. we conclude with

some brief remarks in section 5.

2 euclidean action, surface terms and boundary condi-

tions

the lorentzian action of the pure gravity on a d-dimensional spacetime ml with a
negative cosmological constant,  < 0, may be written as:

il =

1

16g zml

(r  2) +

1

8g zml

k,

(1)

where g is the gravitational constant, r is the scalar curvature of the metric gab, k
is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary ml. the volume elements on
ml and ml are determined by gab and the induced metric on ml, respectively,
and will not be written explicitly. the surface term is added to obtain the correct

equations subject only to the condition that the induced metric on ml is held xed.

inspired by the lorentzian form of the action, one may dene the euclidean action

on a manifold m with boundary m as:

ie = 

1

16g zm

(r  2) 

1

8g zm

k,

(2)

which, upon variation, gives the vacuum einstein equations with (++...+) signature:

rab 

1
2

gabr + gab = 0.

(3)

in euclidean quantum gravity, the central object is the partition function, z,

dened by the path integral over all metrics:

z = z d[g]eie [g].

(4)

in a semiclassical approximation, the dominant contribution to z will come from

uctuations around a saddle point of the action. however, the euclidean action

(2) diverges for non-compact geometries, since the einstein equations imply that

r is constant so the integral is just a multiple of the innite volume of the space.

furthermore, one should also impose some boundary conditions to uctuations around

such spaces to dene the path integral properly. to have a well dened z then, one

can pick up a background geometry gab, obeying (3), and use a modied action

ie[g] = ie[g]  ie[g]

4

(5)

in the denition of the partition function:

z = z d[g]e ie [g].

(6)

this new partition function z is related to z by a normalization with an innite
constant.
if one includes in the path integral the geometries which approach the
background geometry at innity such that ie[g] is nite, then z becomes well dened.
for a saddle point, using einstein equations and up to a nite constant 2, ie may be
rewritten as:

ie = 

1

8g zm

where k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary embedded in the
background space.

(k  k),

(7)

in our case the background space is the d-dimensional ads soliton which is given

by [11](in euclidean signature):

ds2 = a2r2" 1 

rp+1
0

rp+1! d 2 + (dxi)2# +

a2r2  1 

rp+1

rp+1!1

dr2,

(8)

where r is a radial coordinate restricted to r > r0,  is an angular coordinate, xi
(with i = 1...p and d = p + 2) are coordinates on p-dimensional euclidean space
rp and a is the inverse radius which is related to cosmological constant by a2 =
2/(d  1)(d  2). to avoid a conical singularity at r = r0 one should identify 
with period  = 4/(a2(p + 1)r0). we also dene l2 = a2(d  1) so that the einstein
equations (3) may be written as:

rab = l2gab.

(9)

the p = 3 solution is related to the yang-mills gauge theory in 4-dimensions with

one compactied direction. on the other hand, the p = 5 case is related to the ex-

otic 6-dimensional world-volume theory of coincident m-theory vebranes with one

compact direction, which reduces to yang-mills gauge theory in four-dimensions by

a further compactication.

in using this form of the metric in a semiclassical analysis, one faces two important
technical problems. the rst one is that the boundary at r   of ads soliton is

2like in [14], (5) and (7) may not be equal when the integration regions of the back-
ground and the saddle point are dierent. in this case an additional but nite contribution
should be added to (7). however, this point will not alter our discussion of boundary con-
ditions for which we will mainly use (7).

5

rp  s1. therefore, the modied action (7) may also diverge even for suitably well
dened boundary conditions due to the integral over rp. the second closely related
problem is that the interior of ads soliton (regions of nite r) is also non-compact
which implies the existence of other boundaries in addition to boundary at r  
(like the boundary at xixi  ). one should also impose certain boundary condi-
tions along these hypersurfaces.

there are dierent ways of overcoming these technical problems. one may further
redene the partition function (6) by replacing ie by ie/v, where v is the volume
of the space spanned by the coordinates xi. then, one should impose the boundary
conditions that igab = 0 when xixi becomes greater then a constant. this ensures
that ie/v does not diverge, which in turn gives a well dened partition function.

instead of dealing with action densities, we will proceed by modifying the ads
soliton by identifying the coordinates xi with period l. this modication alters the
asymptotic boundary from rp  s1 to t p  s1. one should not then worry about
the two problems mentioned above: the asymptotic integrals are now over t p  s1
which will be convergent for suitable boundary conditions at r  , and the interior
region becomes compact; the only boundary is now located at r  . the original
ads soliton may be recovered by letting l go to innity.

asymptotic boundary conditions will be xed by demanding that (7) be nite for

an instanton. before discussing these boundary conditions, let us point out another

physical motivation for this choice. there is a close connection between (7) and the

total energy dened in the lorentzian context. suppose we nd an instanton solu-

tion, which asymptotically becomes the ads soliton, and try to determine to which

lorentzian spacetime the ads soliton decays (if it does). to nd this spacetime, one

should make an inverse analytical continuation of the instanton [5]. assuming that
x1 = 0 is a plane of symmetry, this may be achieved by sending x1  ix1. the
coordinate x1 now plays the role of time and the energy of the lorentzian solution,
calculated with respect to the ads soliton, turns out to be nite, when(7) being eval-

uated on the instanton is nite. this may easily be seen from the denition of total

energy given in [15] and shows that the physically interesting instantons have f inite

actions. note that a similar relation between the value of the euclidean action and

energy is also encountered in the asymptotically at context.

6

let us now turn to the determination of the asymptotic behavior of a possible

instanton solution. it is assumed that outside a compact region, one can introduce
angular coordinates x  , xi (with periods  and l respectively) and r in which
the metric becomes asymptotically the ads soliton:

gab = gab + hab, hab  0 as r  ,

(10)

such that (7) is nite. we will make no assumptions about the topology of the compact

region. in the asymptotic region and to the leading order in hab, the inverse of the
metric can be found as:

gab = gab  gac hcd gdb.

(11)

the volume form on the boundary grows like rp+1, therefore, to have a well dened
euclidean action we should demand that at large r, k  k = o(1/rp+1). since the
boundary is a r = constant hypersurface, the unit normal vector, na, to this surface
is given by:

na =

1
grr r
a.

using k = ana and further assuming that the r derivatives of the metric fall o
one power faster, the niteness of (7) implies for large r: 3

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

h = o(

1
rp1 ),

hr = o(

1
rp ),

hrr = o(

1
rp+3 ).

one can also calculate the asymptotic form of the christoel symbol as:

r

 = a2r3 + o(

rp+2 ),

+ o(

r

r = o(

 = o(

as it was pointed out in [16], the perturbation hr can be made to fall o faster than
1/rp by an appropriate choice of coordinates at innity.4 since this will not change
the main conclusions of the paper, we do not x this gauge freedom at this point. in

the same paper, the physical boundary conditions were determined for a lorentzian

metric approaching asymptotically to ads4.

3 if we did not periodically identify the coordinates xi, then we had to impose the

boundary conditions igab = 0 when xixi is greater then a constant.

4i thank to m. henneaux for pointing this out to me.

7

compared to the asymptotically at instanton like solutions [5], the metric ap-

proaches the background geometry more rapidly. we will use (13)-(16) at several

dierent points.

in most cases these will be sucient for us to obtain the results

we are seeking. on the other hand, at one important instance when we try to es-

tablish the existence of killing vectors, we will be forced to consider more restrictive

boundary conditions.

3 hermitian dierential operators and zero modes

we are searching properties of possible euclidean metric solutions of (9) obeying the

asymptotic boundary conditions determined in the previous section. let us denote

one of such solutions by m .

in this section, we will introduce and study certain

dierential operators and mainly try to see if they are invertible on suitable hilbert

spaces.

operators l1 and l2

we dene the following dierential operators on the tangent bundle of m :

l1ka  2ka  l2ka,
l2ka  2ka + l2ka,

which will act on the divergence free vector elds,

aka = 0.

(17)

(18)

(19)

the reason for introducing these operators will become clear as we proceed. the

vectors satisfying (19) is a subspace of the total space of vector elds and will be

denoted by v . let us rst show that l1 and l2 are well dened operators on this
subspace:

l1 : v  v,
l2 : v  v.

to verify this, we start from the curvature identity

(ab  ba)c kd = rabc
and contract this with gbc and gad to obtain

eekd + rabd

ecke,

a2ka  babka = 0.

8

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

now, another curvature identity together with the einstein equations (9) give:

abka = baka  l2kb.

(24)

using this in the second term of the (23), one obtains (for an arbitrary vector eld

ka),

a2ka = 2aka  l2bkb.

(25)

if ka  v then aka = 0 and the above equation gives a2ka = 0. in this case,
the denitions of l1 and l2 imply:

a(l1ka) = 0,
a(l2ka) = 0,

(26)

(27)

showing that l1ka  v and l2ka  v when ka  v . this veries that l1 and l2
are well dened operators on v .

we introduce the following inner product on the vector space v :

< k|l >=zm

gabkalb.

(28)

in general, there are vectors in v which do not have well dened inner products.

thus, some boundary conditions should be imposed to eliminate these vector elds.
the fact that, when r is large, the volume form on m grows like rp and the asymptotic
behavior of the metric xed in the previous section suggest the following boundary
conditions on the components of ka (in x, r coordinates):

kr = o(

1

rp/2+2 ),

k = o(

1
rp/2 ).

(29)

we redef ine v to be the space of divergence free vector elds obeying these boundary

conditions. with this redenition, the inner product (28) becomes well dened on v .
note that v is the kernel of the elliptic operator d acting on the one-forms. due
to this fact, we assume that v satises the axioms of hilbert spaces rigorously. we

also assume that the r-derivatives of the components fall o one power faster.

let us show that l1 and l2 are hermitian operators on v . this requires vanishing

of the following surface integral,

zm

nakb(alb) = 0,

9

(30)

for all vectors ka, la  v , where na is the unit normal to m . the volume form on
m grows like rp+1 at large r. using the expression (12) for the unit normal vector,
the asymptotic behavior of the metric and the boundary conditions (29) obeyed by
the vector elds ka and la, one can check that the integrand vanishes as r  .
then, (30) implies, upon integration by parts,

which in turn proves that l1 and l2 are hermitian operators on v :

zm

ka2la = zm

la2ka,

< k|l1l >=< l1k|l >,
< k|l2l >=< l2k|l > .

(31)

(32)

(33)

the boundary conditions which are imposed to obtain a well dened inner product

turn out to be sucient to make l1 and l2 hermitian.

we will now determine the asymptotic behavior of a vector eld ka  v which
satises l1ka = 0 or l2ka = 0. we start from the fact that, when r is large the
components of ka become:
1
rm ),

1
rn ), m 

k = o(

kr = o(

n 

(34)

+ 2,

p
2

.

p
2

to nd the possible values of m and n, one can expand the components in powers of

1/r (which can be done when r is suciently large):

kr =

k =

f (x)
rm +
f(x)
rn +

g(x)
rm+1 + ...,
g(x)
rn+1 + ....

(35)

(36)

after plugging the above expansions into the dierential equations, one can group

the terms according to their powers of 1/r and solve equations order by order. the

lowest order equations, which are sometimes called the indicial equations, determine
the constants m and n. at large r, the components of 2ka can be calculated as (we
set the inverse radius a = 1 from now on):

2kr = r22

r kr +

1
r2  kr + kr + (p + 4)rrkr 

1

+o(

rp+m+1 ) + o(

2
r3 k
rp+n+2 ),

(37)

(38)

2k = r22

r k +

1
r2  k  (p + 1)k + prrk + 2rkr
rp+m2 ),

rp+n+1 ) + o(

+o(

1

1

10

where the suppressed terms, which arise due to the deviation of the metric from the
ads soliton background, will not aect the indicial equation. the terms 1
r2 kr
and 1
r2 k, appeared in (37) and (38), will only contribute to the higher order
equations, even though they survive when the deviation from the background is zero.

thus, they can also be ignored in nding the possible values of m and n. the fact that
the vector elds are divergence free, aka = 0, gives the following relation among
the components:

r2rkr + (p + 2)rkr +

1
r2  k + o(

1

rp+m ) + o(

1

rp+n+1 ) = 0,

(39)

where the suppressed terms have higher powers of 1/r compared to the ones that are

written. now, using (39) for the last term of (37), one can show that the lowest order

1/r equations, obtained from the r-components of the dierential equations l1ka = 0
and l2ka = 0, give the following quadratic equations for m:

l1ka = 0  m2  (p + 3)m + (p + 4) = 0,
l2ka = 0  m2  (p + 3)m + (3p + 6) = 0.

(40)

(41)

fortunately, all the terms which has the constant n turn out to be higher order and

we nally end up with equations for m.

for the vector elds satisfying l1ka = 0, the constant m will have the following

values.

m1 = 1, m2 = p + 4.

(42)

the rst root is not acceptable since it is not consistent with the boundary conditions

imposed on the vector elds. thus, we set m = p + 4. using (38) in the -component

of the equation l1ka = 0, one can obtain a quadratic equation for n,

n2  (p  1)n  (2p + 2) = 0,

(43)

which has the single positive root n = p + 1. therefore, the solutions l1ka = 0,
ka  v , fall o like:

kr = o(

k = o(

(44)

1
rp+4 ),

1
rp+1 ).

for the vector elds obeying l2ka = 0, the roots of m can be read o from (41)

as:

m1 = 3, m2 = p + 2.

(45)

the rst root is not acceptable for the cases p > 1, since it is not consistent with

the boundary conditions, and the roots become equal for p = 1. therefore, we set

11

m = p + 2. then, (38) can be used in the -component of l2ka = 0, to obtain the
following quadratic equation for n:

n2  (p  1)n = 0.

(46)

this has the single positive root n = p  1 and therefore the solutions of l2ka = 0,
ka  v , become for large r

(47)

kr = o(

k = o(

1
rp+2 ),

1
rp1 ).

till now we have xed the boundary conditions which ensure that the operators l1
and l2 are hermitian and determined the asymptotic behavior of their zero modes.
we will now try to obtain further information about the zero modes, since our nal

aim is to use these operators in solving certain dirichlet problems which will possibly

imply existence of the killing vectors. it would be nice if our operators l1 and l2
turned out to be invertible i.e. they did not have any zero modes. this will be the

case for l1, and for l2 we will be able to determine all the zero modes.

we proceed by showing that the hermitian dierential operator l1 does not have

any zero modes. when ka  v , the fact that its divergence free and (24) give

which can be used to rewrite the equation l1ka = 0 as:

abka = l2kb,

we contract the above equation with kb and integrate over all m :

a(akb + bka) = 0.

zm

kba(akb + bka) = 0.

(48)

(49)

(50)

integrating by parts, one can easily obtain, for any vector eld satisfying l1ka = 0
and aka = 0,



1

2 zm

(akb + bka)(akb + bka) +zm

nakb(akb + bka) = 0.

(51)

now, the vector elds in v fall o like (44) when they obey l1ka = 0. this ensures
that the surface integrals vanish which in turn implies,

akb + bka = 0,

(52)

since the remaining integrand in (51) is nowhere negative. therefore, ka is a killing
vector. by the asymptotics (44), both ka and akb vanishes on m . however, it is

12

very well known that if a killing eld and its derivative vanish at any point, then the

killing eld vanishes everywhere [17]. thus ka = 0 and l1 has no zero modes with
the given boundary conditions.

let us now try to learn about the zero modes of the operator l2. we will simply
repeat the above steps, to obtain a relation like (52). using (48), the equation l2ka =
0 can be rewritten as,

a(akb  bka) = 0.

(53)

we rst contract the above equation with kb and integrate over all m . then, inte-
grating by parts, we obtain for any vector eld satisfying l2ka = 0 and aka = 0:
(54)

(akb  bka)(akb  bka) +zm

nakb(akb  bka) = 0.



1

2 zm

the surface integrals vanish due to the asymptotic behavior (47). the remaining

integrand is positive denite which implies that

akb  bka = 0.

(55)

therefore the zero modes of the hermitian operator l2 are closed one-forms. since
aka = 0 they are also co-closed and thus harmonic one-forms.

one can obtain further information about these zero modes by recalling that a

closed one-form can be written as a linear combination of an exact one-form and rst

cohomology classes of the manifold m . the cohomology classes are related only to

the topology of the manifold. in our case, we have assumed that, outside a compact
region, the topology of m become globally the ads soliton i.e. t p  s1 times a real
line (the coordinate r). therefore, near the asymptotic region, the rst cohomology
classes are spanned at most 5 by the one-forms dx. however, these forms cannot be
the zero modes of l2 since they do not obey the boundary conditions imposed on the
vector elds belonging to v . we will show in a moment that the exact forms should

also be excluded. therefore, the zero modes of l2 are the harmonic representatives
of rst cohomology classes of the interior compact region.

to see that the exact forms cannot be the zero modes of l2 we write ka = af ,
for some function f . by the asymptotic behavior of the zero modes of l2 determined

5in the interior region the topology may change such that some of the one-forms dx
become also exact. this is the case, for instance, for the one-form d in the solution (8).

13

in (47), f should behave for large r like,

f = o(

1
rp+1 ).

(56)

since ka is also divergence free, f should satisfy the laplace equation: 2f = 0.
however, any solution of the laplace equation which obeys (56) should be zero. this

can easily be seen by nothing the following relation which is valid for any function

obeying laplace equation:

0 = zm

f2f = zm

(af )(af ) +zm

naf (af ).

(57)

the last surface integral vanishes due to the behavior (56) of f at large r. since
the remaining integrand in the right side is positive denite, one obtains af = 0.
therefore, f is a constant and the constant vanishes since f vanishes at r  . this
shows that exact forms should be excluded from the list of the zero modes of l2.

the laplacian

having studied properties of the dierential operators acting on divergence free vector

elds, we nally turn to the space of functions. let w be the space of square integrable

functions endowed with the following inner product,

< f|g >= zm

f g.

(58)

the inner product is well dened, since the functions in w obey at large r (due to

square integrability):

f  w  f = o(

1

rp/2+1 ).

(59)

the dierential operator that we will consider on w is the laplacian. one can easily
check that, due to the asymptotic behavior of functions determined above, 2 is an
hermitian operator

< f|2g >=< 2f|g > .

(60)

as before, we try to determine the zero modes of 2 and see if it is invertible on w .
the asymptotic behavior of the zero modes can be determined by calculating

2f = r22

r f +

1
r2 f  (p + 2)rrf + o(

1

rp+m+1 ),

(61)

where f = o(1/rm). the indicial equation which follows from the above formula
reads

m(m + 1)  (p + 2)m = 0.

(62)

14

the only solution which is consistent with the boundary condition (59) is m = p + 1.
therefore, zero modes of 2 in w fall o like 1/rp+1. however, repeating the above
arguments which has been used to show that the exact forms cannot be the zero modes

of l2, one can easily see that the zero modes should actually be zero. therefore the
laplacian 2 is an invertible operator on w .

4 existence of harmonic functions and commuting killing

vectors

in the previous section we have considered two vector spaces v and w , endowed with

well dened inner products, and studied properties of the dierential operators l1,
l2 and 2. we have shown that all operators are hermitian and determined the zero
modes. the operators l1 and 2 are shown to have no zero modes and thus are
invertible. in this section we will try to use these operators to show the existence of

harmonic functions and killing vectors.

existence of harmonic functions

although 2 has no zero modes in w , there may be solutions of 2f = 0, where
f 6 w . consider the following dirichlet problem
as

(63)

r  ,

2f = 0,

f  bixi

where bi are arbitrary constants. note that the index i runs from 1 to d  2. since
the coordinates xi are periodically identied with the period l, the function f is not
well dened for nite l. however, the constant l is a free parameter and one can let
l  . indeed, as discussed in section 2, this limit corresponds to the ads soliton.
on the other hand one cannot include the coordinate  in (63) since its period 

is xed ( corresponds to either compactication scale or the inverse temperature of
the boundary conformal eld theory). note also that f 6 w .

to solve the above dirichlet problem we rst dene a trial function t such that
near the asymptotic boundary (where the coordinates x and r are well dened) it
becomes t = bixi. we smoothly extend t to be zero through the interior regions
(where the coordinates x and r may not be well dened) and thus obtain a well
dened function on m . we nd the solution of (63) by writing f = l + t, and solving

for l obeying

2l = 2t,

l  0

as

r  .

(64)

15

using (61), one can check that 2t = o(1/rp+2)  w 6 and thus there is a unique
solution for l  w , since 2 is invertible. by (59), l = o(1/rp/2+1). to obtain more
accurate information about the asymptotic behavior of l, we expand it at large r as

l =

f (x)
rm +

g(x)
rm+1 + ....

m 

p
2

+ 1.

(65)

now, (61) implies that the lowest order terms of 2l fall o like 1/rm. since l obeys
(64), these terms should either cancel each other or be equal to the same order terms

coming from the right hand side. thus, either m should obey the indicial equation
(62) and m = p + 1 or m = p + 2. this implies, at least, l = o(1/rp+1) which,
furthermore, gives the following solution to the dirichlet problem (63):

f = bixi + o(

1
rp+1 ).

(66)

one can also try to solve for l by constructing a greens function, g(r, r), for 2.
the asymptotic behavior of g(r, r) can be deduced from the asymptotics of the

possible zero modes since it obeys the laplace equation except at some singular

points. inverting (64) as l(r) = r g(r, r)2t(r) and letting r  , one nds that
l = o(1/rp+1) and thus f has the same asymptotic behavior (66). since f obeys
2f = 0, it is an harmonic function d df = 0. note also that the one-form df is also
harmonic (d + d)df = 0, where  is the adjoint of d. on the other hand, since in
the construction we have introduced arbitrary constants bi, there are actually d  2
independent harmonic functions. we will denote the harmonic function obtained by
the choice b = (0, 0, ..1, 0..0) by f(i), where in b only the ith entry is one. all these
are valid for all instanton solutions.

existence of killing vectors

the hermitian operator l1 is invertible on v . however, there may be solutions of
l1ka = 0, where ka is a divergence free vector eld which does not belong to v . let
us try to see if the following dirichlet problem has a solution,

l1ka = 0, aka = 0
as

kr  0,

k  a,

r  ,

(67)

where a are arbitrary constants. note that, the contravariant components of the
vector eld are xed on the boundary. on the other hand, the covariant components

6one may naively claim from (61) (by setting m = 0) that 2t = o(1/rp+1). however,
a carefull analysis for t shows that o(1/rp+1) terms cancel each other in (61) which implies
2t = o(1/rp+2).

16

become, for example, k = o(r2) which shows that ka 6 v.

to solve this problem, we rst dene a trial vector eld ta with the following prop-
erties. near the asymptotic boundary, the components t(x, r) are smooth functions
of coordinates x, r such that they vanish when r < r and become exactly ar2
when r > r+, where r and r+ are suciently large numbers with r < r+. the
component function, tr(x, r), is dened to be zero when r < r and will be chosen
to give ata = 0 when r > r. we extend ta to be zero trough the interior regions,
where the coordinates x and r may not be well dened. this gives us a well dened
divergence free vector eld over all m .

we introduce a new vector eld la by writing the desired solution of (67) as:

ka = la + ta.

(68)

by the construction of the trial vector eld ta, one can solve the dirichlet problem
(67) by working the solutions la of,

l1la = l1ta,

la  0,

as

r  .

(69)

we will show that l1ta  v when p > 3. since l1 is an invertible operator on v ,
there is a unique solution of (69) with la  v . this will give a unique solution of the
dirichlet problem (67) for p > 3.

the -component t of the trial vector eld is xed by construction. let us
determine the behavior of tr at large r. as mentioned above, tr is chosen to obtain
a divergence free vector eld, thus satises a rst order dierential equation. using

(39) for the components of ta, we obtain at large r

tr = o(

1
rp ).

(70)

using (37) and (38), one can see that, in l1ta, the terms which come from the
background and contain the constants a cancel each other. the remaining terms
can be determined to fall o like

(l1t)r = o(

1
rp ),

(l1t) = o(

1
rp1 ).

(71)

this shows that l1ta  v when p > 3, since it obeys the boundary conditions (29)
only on that range. as mentioned above, l1 can be inverted to obtain a unique

17

solution la  v . therefore, the components of la obey at least (29). however, we
will need more accurate information about the asymptotic behavior of la. to obtain
this information, we start from the fact that at large r:

lr = o(

1
rm ),

l = o(

1
rn ), m 

p
2

+ 2,

p
2

,

n 

(72)

and expand the components like in (35). the lowest order terms of the r-component
of l1la can be seen to fall o like 1/rm. at this stage there are two possibilities; these
terms may cancel each other or they may be equal to the same order terms coming
from the right hand side of (69) i.e. (l1t)r. for these terms to cancel each other, m
should satisfy exactly the same indicial equation (40) obtained for the zero modes. if

this is the case then m = p + 4, but now in (l1l)r there is no term which can cancel
the lowest order terms coming from (l1t)r. thus the second possibility should be
true. the asymptotic behavior of (l1t)r implies that m = p and lr = o(1/rp). the
same arguments can be repeated for the -components to obtain:

lr = o(

1
rp ),

l = o(

1
rp1 ).

(73)

this shows that there is a unique solution of l1ka = 0, aka = 0, given by ka =
la + ta, which asymptotically becomes (contravariant components):

kr = o(

1
rp2 ),

k = a + o(

1
rp+1 ).

(74)

note that, to be able to solve the dirichlet problem, we are forced to impose p > 3

i.e. the dimension of m should be greater than 5.

we now try to establish that (74) is a killing vector. to show this, one can use the
equation (51), which is valid for any vector eld obeying l1ka = 0 and aka = 0.
if the surface integral in (51) vanishes, then one has akb + bka = 0, since the
remaining terms in (51) are positive denite. there is only one contribution to the
surface integral, coming from nrk(kr + rk), which does not vanish. since the
volume form of m grows like rp+1, nr = o(r) and k = o(1), the surface integral
integral of this term vanishes when

kr + rk = o(

1
rp+3 ).

(75)

however, one can easily check that this condition is not satised by the solution (74)
of the dirichlet problem. the solution (74) obeys, instead, kr + rk = o(1/rp),
which shows that the surface integral may not vanish in general. note that a 
x

18

is already an asymptotic killing vector eld of any possible instanton like solution.

to see on which spaces the surface integral vanishes, let us concentrate on a class of

instanton solutions obeying more restrictive boundary conditions such as

h = o(

1
rp+2 ),

hr = o(

1
rp+3 ),

hrr = o(

1
rp+6 ).

(76)

compared to the asymptotic behavior (13), the metrics of this family fall o three

power of r faster.

in order to take into account of this dierence in the previous

formulas, one should simply shift p by 3. this implies that the dirichlet problem (67)

can now be solved in any dimensions and the solution (74) becomes asymptotically

kr = o(

1
rp+1 ),

k = a + o(

1
rp+4 ).

(77)

by plugging (77) into the identity (51), one can see that the surface integrals do van-

ish. therefore, (77) is indeed a killing vector. on the othar hand, since the constants
a are completely arbitrary, there are actually p + 1 independent killing vectors. we
will denote the killing vector eld which is obtained by the choice a = (0, 0..1, ..0)
by k(s)a where p + 1  s  1 and in a only the sth entry is one. we remind the
reader that the proof only applies to the family (76).

by dening

za  [k(s), k(s)]a = k(s)bbk(s)

a  k(s)bbk(s)
a ,

(78)

one can easily show that the killing vectors of this family also commute. the asymp-

totic behavior (77) implies that

zr = o(

1
rp+3 ),

z = o(

1
rp+2 ).

(79)

since the commutator of two killing vectors is again a killing vector, za is a killing
vector. being a killing vector and having the above asymptotic behavior, za  v and
l1za = 0. however, since l1 is invertible, za = 0. thus the killing vectors commute
with each other.

operator l2

we have studied dirichlet problems related to the operators l1 and 2. as we
have discussed, the existence of the solutions imply the existence of certain geometric

properties. there is another operator, l2, which we have studied in section 2 and not
considered yet in the context of dirichlet problems. since the hermitian dierential

19

operator l2 is not invertible on v , one cannot naively solve a dirichlet problem using
l2 (at least following the steps discussed so far). it seems that one should also make
some topological assumptions to obtain an invertible operator. here, we simply note
that the one-forms af(i) are divergence free and they are also eigenvectors of l2
with zero eigenvalue, l2af(i) = 0. note also that af(i) 6 v .

relation between k(i)

a and df(i)

we conclude this section by showing that all but one of the killing vectors are duals
of harmonic one-forms df(i):

k(i)aaf(i) = i
i.

(80)

note that at r =  the killing vector k(i)a and the function f(i) equal to 
xi, respectively. to prove (80), using (ak(i)

xi and
b) = 0, l1k(i)a = 0 and l2af(i) = 0, we

calculate

2(cid:16)k(i)aaf(i)(cid:17) = (cid:16)2k(i)a(cid:17)af(i) + k(i)a(cid:16)2af(i)(cid:17) +
2(cid:16)bk(i)a(cid:17)(cid:16)baf(i)(cid:17) = 0,

(81)

which shows that the functions k(i)aaf(i) obey the laplace equation. one can now
use (57) which is valid for any function obeying laplace equation. we focus on the
surface integrals. if one writes g = k(i)aaf(i), then using the asymptotic behavior
(77) and (66) of k(i)a and f(i), respectively, one can obtain

then, the surface integrals in (57), obtained after plugging g into, can be written

g = i

i + o(

1
rp+1 ).

(82)

explicitly as:

i

izm

naag +zm

o(

1
rp+1 )naag.

(83)

the rst term in the above integrals vanishes since it can be written as the integral of
2g over all m which is zero, and the second integral vanishes since the volume form
on m grows like rp+1, na = o(r), ag = o(1/rp+1) which imply that the integrand
vanishes as r  . therefore, the surface integrals vanish in (57). the remaining
integrand in (57) is positive denite which implies that ag = 0. therefore, g is
constant and the constant is i
i since g reaches this value at r  . this proves
(80), which in turn shows that the killing vectors k(i)
a and the one-forms df(i) cannot
vanish at any point. thus, all but one of the killing vectors do not have any xed

points and act on m freely. this fact is important since it enables one to choose
global coordinates adapted to killing vectors, which are the functions f(i) in our case.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have tried to obtain certain geometric properties of ads instantons.

after determining the asymptotic behavior of the metric, we have studied certain

hermitian dierential operators, dened on suitable hilbert spaces. using these op-
erators, we have shown that on a d-dimensional instanton there are d  2 harmonic
functions. for a class of instatons, we have also proved the existence of d  1 com-
muting killing vectors. furhermore, all but one of the killing vectors are shown to

have no xed points.

these results may be usuful in proving the semiclassical stability of ads soliton.

we believe that the existence proof of the killing vectors on the family (76) can be

generalized to all instanton solutions by choosing more appropriate trial vector elds

in solving the dirichlet problem corresponding to l1. if this could be done, one can
introduce globally well dened coordinates adapted to the killing vectors which act

on the manifold freely, and try to solve the einstein equations in these coordinates

as an attempt to obtain all possible instanton solutions.

the existence of an instanton solution does not necessarily imply that the ads

soliton is semiclassically unstable. this solution may well describe the decay of an-

other unstable state to ads soliton. to see that a ground state is semiclassically

unstable, one should study the quadratic uctuations around an instanton solution.

the negative action modes which may arise in this quadratic approximation is a sign

of semiclassical instability.

in the the proofs of semiclassical stability of minkowski space and the positive

energy theorem for asymptotically at spaces given in [4], the hermitian operators

and their greens functions played the crucial role. the operators introduced in this

paper may also be useful in studying the positive energy conjecture of horowitz and

myers. in the present paper, the metric is positive denite and this plays the key

role at each step in deriving the results. in the lorentzian context, one can choose an

euclidean initial value hypersurface and try to adapt the arguments presented here

to obtain information about this euclidean hypersurface.
