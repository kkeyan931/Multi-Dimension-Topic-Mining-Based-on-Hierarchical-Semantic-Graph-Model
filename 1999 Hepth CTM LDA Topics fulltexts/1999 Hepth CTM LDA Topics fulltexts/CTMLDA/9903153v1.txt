abstract

we review and elaborate on properties of the string tension in

two-dimensional gauge theories.

the rst model we consider is massive qed in the m  e limit.
we evaluate the leading string tension both in the fermionic and
bosonized descriptions. we discuss the next to leading corrections
in m/e. the next-to-leading terms in the long distance behavior of
the quark-antiquark potential, are evaluated in a certain region of ex-
ternal versus dynamical charges. the nite temperature behavior is
also determined.

in qcd2 we review the results for the string tension of quarks in
cases with dynamical quarks in the fundamental, adjoint, symmetric
and antisymmetric representations. the screening nature of sy m2 is
re-derived.

1 introduction

two-dimensional gauge theories serve as a theoretical laboratory for study-
ing four-dimensional gauge theories. non-perturbative issues, such as con-
nement and spectrum of models, can be addressed in these theories. for
recent reviews see[1, 2].

in this framework, it is also possible to calculate the string tension  of

the conning part of the potential,

v = r

(1)

the leading term of the string tension (in mass over charge parameter), in
the massive schwinger model (u(1) gauge theory with massive matter, which
we call electron), was calculated by using bosonization, long time ago[3]

qed = m 1  cos(2

qext
qdyn

)! ,

(2)

where m is the electron mass,  = e exp()
23/2 , e the gauge coupling,  the euler
number and qext,qdyn are the external and dynamical charges respectively (we
measure charges in units of e, thus qext and qdyn are dimensionless).

note that the string tension vanishes whenever the external charge is an
integer multiple of the dynamical charge, qext = nqdyn. this is expected,
since in this case dynamical charges, via electron-positron pairs, can screen
the external source. explicitly, n pairs are created, with n electrons screening
the positive charge and the n positrons the negative one. another important
and somewhat unexpected result is that the string tension vanishes also when
m = 0. this phenomenon can be explained in several ways. in the mass-
less theory it is easy to produce pairs from the vacuum. therefore, innite
amount of integer charges which are produced, may form a coherent state
with a fractional charge and screen the fractional external charge. a second
explanation is that, due to the chiral anomaly, the photon becomes massive
resulting in a short range potential.

the expression in massive qcd2 is[4]

qcd = mr xi  1  cos(4i

kext
kdyn

)!

(3)

where r = e exp()
(2)3/2 , i are the isospin eigenvalues of the dynamical represen-
tation, kext and kdyn are the ane current algebra levels of the external and
dynamical representations, respectively. this expression was shown to hold
for the fundamental and the adjoint representations. other representations
were also discussed in[4], with appropriate expressions for the string tension,
as generalizations of eq.(3).

note that when m = 0 the string tension (3) vanishes, as in the abelian
case[5]. the explanation via acquiring mass is now more involved than in
qed, as we are now in the gauge dependent sector[6, 7]. another expla-
nation, which has no direct abelian analogue, is related to the equivalence
theorem of kutasov and schwimmer[8]. the massless adjoint fermions model
is physically equivalent to the multi-avor massless model with nf = nc
fermions in the fundamental representation. therefore the original adjoint
fermion can be expressed as a fundamental fermions which can screen the
external source.

the plan of the paper, which is an expanded version of[4] and [9], but also
with several new results, is as follows. in section 2 and 3 we calculate the
string tension for the massive schwinger model in both the fermionic and the
bosonic languages. the bosonic language will be useful for the non-abelian
generalization and fermionic language will be useful when we will discuss
supersymmetric theories.

section 4 is devoted to quantum corrections to the string tension. note
that the expressions (2) and (3) are only the leading terms in mass per-
turbation theory and are valid when m  e. the next to leading order
correction, in the abelian case, was derived in[10] and it is reviewed briey
in this section.

in section 5 we discuss the short range corrections to the conning po-
tential. we focus on the abelian case, believing that the non-abelian case
is very similar. our conclusion is that apart from the linear potential, a
screening part, which arise from a massive component of the photon/gluon,
is present.

in section 6 we comment on the behavior of the string tension when nite
temperature is introduced. we follow ref.[11] and conclude that connement
persists even at high temperatures. this is peculiar to two dimensions.

section 7 and 8 are devoted to the non-abelian generalization. we com-
pute the string tension for the cases of matter in the fundamental and adjoint

2

representations (section 7) and symmetric and anti-symmetric representa-
tions (section 8). these sections are based on ref.[4].

in section 9 we show that the string tension vanishes in supersymmetric
gauge theories by showing that there is no < tr5 >= 0 condensate in
these models.

the appendix is devoted to a derivation of the quark anti-quark external
current. it is shown that the relevant charge of the external source is the
chiral anomaly (the ane lie algebra level).

2 the schwinger model

let us review the derivation of the string tension in the massive schwinger
model, in the fermionic language. consider the partition function of two
dimensional massive qed

z =

(4)

z dad d exp(cid:18)iz d2x (

1
4e2 f 2

 + i 6  m   qdyna )(cid:19) ,

where qdyn is the charge of the dynamical fermions. gauge xing terms were
not written explicitly. let us add an external pair with charges qext at
l, namely jext
0 = qext((x + l)  (x  l)), so that the change of l is
jext
 = 0, the
action including the coupling to the external current is also gauge invariant.
now, one can eliminate this charge by performing a local, space-dependent

 a(x). note that by choosing jext

 which is conserved, jext

where 5 = 01. we choose a left-handed rotation (or equally well a right-
handed one) rather than an axial one, in analogy with the non-abelian case
(see section 7), where it is simpler to do so.

the rotation introduce a change in the action, due to the chiral anomaly

the external source and the anomaly term are similar, both being linear
in the gauge potential. this is the reason that the -vacuum and electron-
positron pair at the boundaries are the same in two-dimensions[3]. in the
following we assume  = 0, as otherwise we absorb it in . choosing the
a1 = 0 gauge and integrating by parts, the anomaly term looks like an
external source

qdyn

(10)

this term can cancel the external source by the choice

(x) = 2

qext

((x + l)  (x  l)).

let us take the limit l  . the form of the action, in the region b of
l < x < l is

thus the total impact of the external electron-positron pair is a chiral rota-
tion of the mass term. this term can be written as

(12)

the string tension is the vacuum expectation value (v.e.v.) of the hamilto-
nian density in the presence of the external source relative to the v.e.v. of
the hamiltonian density without the external source, in the l   limit.
(13)

 =< h >  < h0 >0

where |0i0 is the vacuum state with no external sources. the change in the
vacuum energy is due to the mass term. the change in the kinetic term
which appears in (8) does not contribute to the vacuum energy[4]. thus

) < i5 > m <  >0

(14)
thus, the values of the condensates <  > and < 5 > are needed. the
easiest way to compute these condensates is bosonization, but it can also be
computed directly in the fermionic language which at m = 0 is [12]

<  >m=0= e

(17)

though this expression is only the leading term in a m/e expansion and
might be corrected[10], when qext is an integer multiple of qdyn the string
tension is exactly zero, since in this case the rotated action(11) is not changed
from the original one (4).

3 the schwinger model in bosonic form

in their seminal paper, coleman jackiw and susskind used[3] the bosonized
version of the schwinger model to calculate the string tension. we present
here their calculation, for completeness.

the bosonized lagrangian, in the gauge a1 = 0, is the following

 (20)

hence, similarly to the previous derivation, a local chiral rotation may be
used to eliminate the external source. the calculation of the string tension
is exactly the same as in the previous section.

the relevant part of the hamiltonian density is

h = m 2 cos(2  + 2
e )2, the vacuum is  = 0. setting this choice in (21)

qext

(21)

)

to zeroth order in ( m
and subtracting the v.e.v. of the free hamiltonian, we arrive at (2).

4 corrections to the abelian string tension

the expression (2) contains only the leading m
e contribution to the abelian
string tension. this expression was computed in section 3, using a classical
average. however, as we used the normal ordering scale  which is the
photon mass for e  m, taking  = 0 actually gives the full quantum
answer, as is evident by comparing with the fermionic calculation of section
2.

the full perturbative (in m) string tension can be written as [10]

qed = m

[13]. higher coecients were not calculated yet.

the value of the rst coecient is c1 = 1 and the next is c2 = 8.91 exp()
note that for nite m

e we have to minimize the potential

but as long as m is small compared to , only m = 0 is a solution.

thus, there are no m
we expect that similar corrections as those in eq.(22) will occur in the
non-abelian case. for the fundamental/adjoint case, the following expression
may correct the leading term(3)

5 correction to the leading long distance abelian

potential

the potential (1) is the dominant long range term. however, there are, of
course, corrections. in this section we present these corrections.

in order to solve these equation, it is useful to eliminate the bosonized mat-

ter eld . using the approximation sin 2  2, we arrive at (in

momentum space),

a0(k) =

e2(k2 + 4m 2)
k2(k2 + (4m 2 + e2

jext(k)

(28)

where k is the fourier transform of the space coordinate. we will discuss the
validity of our approximation for  later in this section. the last equation
can be rewritten as

note that the photon propagator has two poles; a massless pole repro-
duces the string tension and a massive pole which adds a screening term to
the potential.

note also that in the massless case, when m 2 = 0, only the second term

survives and the photon has only one pole with mass square e2

6 finite temperature

in this section we would like to comment on the behavior of the string tension
in the presence of nite temperature. it is interesting to check whether the
string is torn due to high temperature and whether the system undergoes a
phase transition from connement to de-connement.

the prescription for calculating quantities at nite temperature t is to
formulate the theory on a circle in euclidean time with circumference  =
t 1.

for the purpose of calculating the string tension, we can follow the same
steps which were used in sections 2 and 3 leading to a modication of eq.(17)

9

as (a comprehensive discussion of this issue is given at[11])

 = m <  >t (1  cos 2

qext
qdyn

)

(40)

it is enough to calculate <  >t , the condensate at nite temperature, in
the massless schwinger model.

following ref.[12], the chiral condensate behaves as

and

<  >(t0) 

e
23/2 e,

<  >(t) 2t e 3/2t

e

.

(41)

(42)

the above result (42) indicates that the string is not torn even at very
high temperatures. the explicit expression in[11] shows that <  >t is
non-zero for all t . thus, the system does not undergoes a phase transition.
it is just energetically favorable to have the electron-positron pair conned.

a version which takes into account instanton eects is given in [15], but for
our purposes it will not be needed.

the action (44) diers from (43) by a factor of one half in front of the
wzw and interaction terms, because g is real and represents majorana
fermions. another dierence is that g now is an (n 2  1) (n 2  1) orthog-
onal matrix. the two actions (43) and (44) can be schematically represented
by one action

(45)

where a = 0 gauge was used, s0 stands for the wzw action and the
kinetic action of the gauge eld, kdyn is the level (the chiral anomaly) of the
dynamical charges (k = 1 for the fundamental representation of su(n) and
k = n for the adjoint representation).

let us add an external charge to the action. we choose static (with
respect to the light-cone coordinate x+) charge and therefore we can omit its
kinetic term from the action. thus an external charge coupled to the gauge
eld would be represented by

suppose that we want to put a quark and an anti-quark at a very large
separation. a convenient choice of the charges would be a direction in the
algebra in which the generator has a diagonal form. the simplest choice

11

is a generator of an su(2) subalgebra. since a rotation in the algebra is
always possible, the results are insensitive to this specic choice. as an
example we write down the generator in the case of fundamental and adjoint
representations.

in that limit u = 1 everywhere except at isolated points, where it is not well
dened.

the string tension can be calculated easily from (48) [3]. it is simply the
vacuum expectation value (v.e.v.) of the hamiltonian density, relative to the
v.e.v. of the hamiltonian density of the theory without an external source,

 =< h >  < h0 >

the vacuum of the theory is given by g = 1. in terms of the variable g, this
conguration points in the 3 direction and hence satises our assumptions

therefore the string tension is

(49)

which is the desired result.
a few remarks should be made:
(i) the string tension (49) reduces to the abelian string tension (2) when
abelian charges are considered. it follows that the non-abelian generalization
is realized by replacing the charge q with the level k.

(ii) the string tension was calculated in the tree level of the bosonized
action. perturbation theory (with m as the coupling) may change eq.(49),
since the loop eects may add o(m2) contributions. however, we believe
that it would not change its general character. in fact, one feature is that
the string tension vanishes for any m when kext
is an integer, as follows from
kdyn
eq.(48), since the action does not depend then on kext at all.

(iii) when no dynamical mass is present, the theory exhibits screening.
this is simply because non-abelian charges at the end of the world interval
can be eliminated from the action by a chiral transformation of the matter
eld.

(iv) when the test charges are in the adjoint representation kext = n,
equation (49) predicts screening by the fundamental charges (with kdyn = 1).
(v) string tension appears when the test charges are in the fundamental
representation and the dynamical charges are in the adjoint [16]. the value
of the string tension is

 = madj(cid:18)2(1  cos

4
n

) + 4(n  2)(1  cos

2
n

)(cid:19)

(50)

as follows from eq.(48) for this case.

14

the case of su(2) is special. the 4 which appears in eq.(49) is replaced
by 2, since the bosonized form of the external su(2) fundamental matter
diers by a factor of a half with respect to the other su(n) cases (see
appendix). hence, the string tension in this case is 4madj.

8 symmetric and anti-symmetric representa-

tions

the generalization of (49) to arbitrary representations is not straightforward.
however, we can comment about its nature (without rigorous proof).

let us focus on the interesting case of the antisymmetric representation.
one can show that in a similar manner to [14], the wzw action with g taken
to be 1
2n(n  1) unitary matrices, is a bosonized version of
qcd2 with fermions in the antisymmetric representation.
the antisymmetric representation is described in the young-tableaux no-
2n(n  1) and its diagonal

tation by two vertical boxes. its dimension is 1

and consequently k = n  2. when the dynamical charges are in the fun-
damental and the external in the antisymmetric the string tension should
vanish because tensor product of two fundamentals include the antisymmet-
ric representation. indeed, (49) predicts this result.

the more interesting case is when the dynamical charges are antisym-
metric and the external are fundamentals.
in this case the value of the
string tension depends on whether n is odd or even[16]. when n is odd the
string tension should vanish because the anti-fundamental representation can
be built by tensoring the antisymmetric representation with itself 1
2(n  1)
times. when n is even string tension must exist. note that (49) predicts

 = 2mas(n  2)(1  cos

)

(52)

which is not zero when n is odd.

the resolution of the puzzle seems to be the following. non-abelian
charge can be static with respect to its spatial location. however, its repre-
sentation may change in time due to emission or absorption of soft gluons
(without cost of energy). our semi-classical description of the external charge
as a c-number is insensitive to this scenario. we need an extension of (46)
which takes into account the possibilities of all various representations. one
possible extension is

ja
ext = a3kext(1 + ln)((x + l)  (x  l))

(53)

where l is an arbitrary positive integer. this extension takes into account
the cases which correspond to 1 + ln charges multiplied in a symmetric way.
the resulting string tension is

 = mr xi  1  cos(4i

kext
kdyn

(1 + ln))! ,

(54)

which includes the arbitrary integer l. what is the value of l that we should
pick ?

the dynamical charges are attracted to the external charges in such a way
that the total energy of the conguration is minimal. therefore the value of
l which is needed, is the one that guarantees minimal string tension.

thus the extended expression for string tension is the following

 = min

kext
kdyn

(1 + ln))!)

l (mr xi  1  cos(4i
in the case of dynamical antisymmetric charges and external fundamen-
2(n  3) gives zero string tension. when n is even the
the expression (55) yields the right answer in some other cases also,
like the case of dynamical charges in the symmetric representation. the
bosonization for this case can be derived in a similar way to that of the
antisymmetric representation, and t 3 is given by

tals and odd n, l = 1
string tension is given by (52).

and therefore k = n + 2. when the external charges transform in the
fundamental representation and n is odd, eq.(55) predicts zero string tension
(as it should). when n is even the string tension is given by

we discussed only the cases of the fundamental, adjoint, anti-symmetric
and symmetric representations, since we used bosonization techniques which
are applicable to a limited class of representations[17].

we now introduce an external current. the external source breaks explic-
itly supersymmetry. however, this breaking does not aect our derivation.
we assume a semi-classical quark anti-quark pair which points in some direc-
tion in the algebra. without loss of generality this direction can be chosen
as the 3 direction (isospin). the additional part in the lagrangian is
tr jext
= [c(rext)]a3((x + l)  (x  l)) and [c(rext)] is
a c-number which depends on the representation of the external source, in
analogy with kext of chapter 7. the interaction term can be eliminated by
a left-handed rotation of the gluino eld in the 3 direction (we are using a

the chiral rotation introduces an anomaly term tr (x)t 3

to cancel the external charges.
the choice (x) = 2 c(rext)

((x + l) (x l)) leads to an action which
is similar to the original (57), but has a chiral rotated term. the information
of the external source is now transformed into a rotation angle.

the terms which are relevant to the computation of the string tension
are those which appear in the interaction lagrangian. in this case, it is the
gluino pseudo-scalar term

tr 2i5  tr 2i5

(60)

let us see how this change inuences the hamiltonian vacuum energy.
in the original theory, without the external source, the hamiltonian h0 has
no v.e.v., since the theory is supersymmetric and h0  q2 (where q is
in particular it means that there is no < tr 5 >
the supercharge).
condensate1. the reason is the following. the light-cone hamiltonian density
of the system is given by

h = tr e2(

j+)2 + tr 2ie5

(61)

where j+ denotes the total, scalar and gluino, current which couples to the
in addition we may use the
gauge eld. susy implies that < h >= 0.

note that we assumed that susy is not broken dynamically. the nu-

merical analysis of[19] indicates that this is indeed the case.

let us compute the hamiltonian density of the rotated theory. in the

by using the fact that t 3 is diagonal, and the vacuum state is color symmet-
ric, we get

where  = liml (x). the rst term on the right hand side vanishes since
as argued before < tr 5 >= 0, and the second term vanishes since the
isospin eigenvalues, a, come in pairs of opposite signs.

thus < h >= 0 and the string tension is zero.
note that though we used the classical expression for the external current
and the eective hamiltonian may include other terms, these terms cannot
change the value of the string tension. it is so because this theory contains
only one dimension-full parameter, the gauge coupling e, and therefore the
string tension is some number times e2. we showed that this number is zero
and higher terms in e which may appear in the eective hamiltonian cannot
aect the string tension.

the meaning of the last result is that a quark anti-quark pair located
at x =  generate a linear potential. physically, it is a consequence of
innitely many adjoint fermions and scalars which are produced from the
vacuum, as there is no mass gap, that are attracted to the external source,

19

form a soliton in the fundamental representation and result in screening it. a
complementary argument[6, 20] is that due to loop eects, the intermediate
gauge boson acquires a mass m 2  e2nc, which leads to a yukawa potential
between the external quark anti-quark pair.
the above result can be generalized to theories with extended supersym-

metry and additional massive or massless matter content.

we argue that any supersymmetric gauge theory in two dimensions is
screening. technically, the reason is that the gluino is coupled to other elds
in such a way that < h >= 0 (guaranteed if susy is not broken dynamically)
and therefore there are no non-trivial chiral condensates. however, since
the string tension is proportional to chiral condensates, susy leads to zero
string tension. physically,
it follows from the fact that the gluino is an
adjoint massless fermion. since it does not acquire mass, external sources
are screened, as in the non-supersymmetric massless model. recently the
spectrum of various supersymmetric models was derived. the shape of the
spectrum conrms our prediction[19, 21].

in fact, the essential requirement for a screening nature of the type argued
above, is to have among the charged particles at least one massless particle
whose masslessness is protected by an unbroken symmetry. the symmetry
can be gauge symmetry combined with supersymmetry or chiral symmetry.

we give here a detailed derivation of the external quark anti-quark eld (46)
for n > 2 and with 2 in exponent for n = 2.

for the case of external charges in a real representation the u eld can
chosen to point in some special direction in the su(n) algebra which we take
to be 3, namely u = expit 3. for external charges in a complex repre-
sentation one has to dress this ansatz with a baryon number part, namely
u = exp i exp it 3. let us view the external source as the limit of a
dynamical variable with very large mass. let us choose the gauge a = 0.
then we can take a+ = a+t 3, as the other directions do not couple. the
lagrangian for the real case takes the form

for su(2), it is the only case where the adjoint does not contain isospin 1
