domain walls of d=5 supergravity and

xpoints of n =1 super yang mills

abstract

employing the ads/cft correspondence, we give an explicit supergravity pic-
ture for the renormalization group ow of couplings 4-d super yang mills with
four supercharges. the solution represents a domain wall of 5-d, n=2 super-
gravity, that interpolates between two (dierent) ads5 vacua and is obtained by
gauging a u (1) subgroup of the su (2) r-symmetry. on the supergravity side the
domain wall couples only to scalar elds from vector mulitplets, but not to scalars
from hyper multiplets. we discuss the c-theorem, the -functions and consider
two examples: one is the sugra solution related to zk orbifolds (corresponding to
n=2 sym) and the other is an orientfold construction for an elliptically bered
cy with f1 basis (corresponding to n=1 sym).

introduction

many eld theories ow under the renormalization group (rg) towards xpoints, where
they become nite and universal (scheme independent). however, the xpoint values
of the couplings are not necessarily small and generically perturbation theory breaks
down. on the other hand, employing the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] we can
formulate these interacting eld theories in terms of ads gravity. super yang-mills
in 4 dimensions e.g., becomes conformal near xpoints and is expected to be dual to
ads5 gravity  at least in appropriate limits. the ow between two dierent xpoints
corresponds in supergravity to domain walls (dw), which are kink solutions connecting
two vacua which appear as extrema of the potential (typically ads spaces). for a review
on domain walls see [4] and dierent aspects of the ads/cft correspondence (or more
general dw/qft correspondence) are discussed in [5, 6].

domain walls are supported by at least one scalar eld and appear naturally in su-
pergravity where a subgroup of the r-symmetry has been gauged. as a consequence
of the gauging the sugra lagrangian contains a potential and the ow of the eld
theory is encoded in non-trivial supergravity scalars that run from one extremum of
the potential to another. from these xed scalars it is straightforward to obtain the
corresponding xed couplings in the eld theory. if the potential allows only for one
extremum the eld theory has either an ir or uv xpoint, but not both.

for a concrete supergravity potential, it is straightforward to expand a solution around
a given xpoint. however, in order to get a global picture, we need an explicit solution
that interpolates between two (dierent) ads5 vacua on both sides of the wall. having
this solution it should be straightforward to calculate eld theory quantities like -
functions or anomalous dimensions.

the qualitative picture depends very much on the amount of unbroken supersymmetry
and only in eld theory with at most four supercharges we can expect a ow between
two non-trivial xpoints. one way to break partly supersymmetry has been discussed
in [7, 8] and represents a non-abelian gauging of d=5, n=8 supergravity.

another possibility is to gauge a generic n=2 supergravity which has in the ungauged
case only eight supercharges and the domain wall will break at least one half of them.
in these models the scalar elds enter two dierent multiplets: the vector multiplets
or hypermultiplets, and for many purposes it is reasonable to consider one sector only.
this truncation is always possible as long as the scalars are not charged, but by gauging
the su(2) r-symmetry the scalars in the hypermultiplets become charged and we can-
not ignore them; they become dynamical elds. an interesting domain wall solution for
this non-abelian gauging has been discussed in [9] and it contains an arbitrary number
of vector multiplets which couple to the universal hypermultiplet; this formulation has
been extended to include non-universal hypermultiplets [10].

in this paper we will explore the situation where only a u(1) subgroup of the r-
symmetry has been gauged and the hypermultiplets remain uncharged and we can

2

consistently decouple this sector. as we will see, these domain walls provide a super-
gravity solution for a non-trivial rg ow connecting two xpoints. since this solution
holds for any prepotential, we obtain an exact expression in the two-derivative approx-
imation for the -functions.

we have organized our paper as follows. we start with a discussion of the domain wall
solution and show that it represents a bps conguration. in section 3 we will describe
the sypersymmetric ow between extrema of the superpotential and we formulate the
c-theorem, where the c-function will determine the -functions. the domain wall
solution is quite general and is not related to a specic example or eld theory. to
be concrete we discuss in section 4 two examples, one related to n=2 and the other
to n=1 super yang mills, where the scalars run from the boundary of the moduli
space towards an su(2) enhancement point. the central charges and -functions are
calculated. in the conclusion we will summarize our results.

let us start with some general remarks about gauged n=2 supergravity in 5 dimen-
sions, see [11, 12] for more details. as mentioned in the introduction we are interested
in an abelian gauging and can truncate the model to the vector multiplets sector only.
the bosonic lagrangian is then given by

s5 = z h1

where (, ) = 0, 1,   , 4 are space-time indices; a, b = 1, . . . , n count the number of
vector multiplets (each containing one real scalar a and one gauge eld), in addition
there is one gauge eld in the gravity multiplet so that i, j = 0, . . . n. both the gauge
elds and the scalar part have non-trivial couplings gij and gab which depends on
the scalar elds. the potential p arises due to the gauging of an u(1) subgroup of
the r-symmetry and the corresponding gauge eld is a linear combination of all other
abelian gauge elds

a = viai

where vi are constants (fayet-illiopoulos terms). notice, by this abelian gauging
fermions become charged, but all scalars from the vector as well as hypermultiplets
remain neutral. in contrast, under a non-abelian gauging the hypermultiplets become
charged and one can not ignore them.

we are especially interested in a solution, which describes a 3-brane or domain wall
living in a 5-d asymptotic anti-de sitter space. we assume that it is at, static and
isotropic which yields as ansatz for the metric

ds2 = e2u g2r2h  dt2 + dy2

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

3i + e4u dr2
g2r2 ,

(3)

where u is a function of the radius r and becomes constant in the asymptotic ads
vacuum.

the gauging can be viewed in dierent ways. from the m- or f-theory perspective,
one compacties on a calabi-yau, but with non-trivial (=non-zero mode) internal
components of the 4-form eld strength. as discussed in [13] this is required for a
consistent reduction of the horava-witten model [14] and yields naturally 3-branes
in 5 dimensions. on the other hand from the 10-d perspective [15, 16], the space
transverse to the 3-branes is given by a cone, ds  dr2 + r2ds2
x, over the horizon
manifold ds2
x which is generically not spherical symmetric. this is the case at least
as long as one is in a region which we call ads5 vacuum, where the scalars become
constant and which correspond to xpoints.
in general however, one cannot expect
that the 10-d metric factorizes, e.g., non-extreme ads black holes can be interpreted
as rotating 3-branes [17, 18, 19]. to get a better understanding of our solution it may
help to adopt the m- or even f-theory approach.

before we come to the generic n=2 case, we will discuss the solution that can naturally
be embedded into n=4,8 supergravity.

2.2 a simple example

in the past years we have learned a lot about 5-d black holes and string-type solutions,
which are the natural objects that are charged under the gauge elds. much less
is known about domain wall solutions. the main dierence is that black holes are
well dened in an asymptotic at spacetime whereas domain walls are asymptotically
ads, if we imposing that the asymptotic space is maximal supersymmetric. but it is
straightforward to truncate, or if one likes to promote, any (static) black hole into a
domain wall. what one has to do is:

(i) embed it into an ads space,
(ii) replace the s3-horizon by s3,k (3-sphere with constant curvature k) and
(iii) take the limit k  0.
the rst step has been discussed in [20], the second one in [21] and the last one is
trivial, see also [22, 17, 18, 19, 23] where other dimensions have also been discussed.

let us explain it for the simple example of the 3-charge solution. this is an interesting
example, because due to the solutions generating technique [24, 25], any black hole
that can be embedded into ungauged n=4,8 supergravity can be obtained from this
solution2.

2however the u -duality group is broken by the gauging and we will not discuss here to which

extend the solution generating technique is applicable.

(4)

where for k = 1 the horizon is a sphere and for k = 1 it becomes a hyperboloid. in
the limit k  0 this solution becomes a 3-brane compatible with our ansatz (3)

ds2 = (h1h2h3)1/3g2r2h  dt2 + dy2

(7)

with the minimum at 1 = 2 = 1. let us stress, that in order to perform the
truncation to a at (k = 0) 3-brane, it is crucial to consider gauged supergravity with
an asymptotic ads vacuum  the extreme ungauged solution (with no potential) cannot
be truncated to a at 3-brane! let us also mention, that in the non-extreme case the
gauge elds survive the domain wall limit k  0, see [17, 18, 19].
this solution contains three classes corresponding to: one, two or three non-trivial
harmonic functions. asymptotically all solutions become ads5, but they dier near
the core. to discuss the dierent cases in more detail we may equalize all non-vanishing
harmonics, which means that we replace h1h2h3 = h n (n = 1, 2, 3). choosing a
coordinate system where the metric becomes

ds2 = e2ah  dt2 + dy2

we nd near r  0

where a is an arbitrary parameter. only the case n = 3 behaves smooth near  = a
(or at r = 0), the n = 2 case has a curvature singularity and for n = 1 the metric
exhibits a conical singularity (the case n = 2 has been addressed also in [26, 27]) in

addition, after equalizing the harmonic functions we can have at most one scalar eld,
which either vanishes or diverges near the origin and plays the role of the dilaton. this
singularity indicates that for these two cases the corresponding yang-mills coupling
runs either to a strongly or weakly coupled regime (electric or magnetic picture cp.
[28]).

perhaps more interesting than these singular cases is the case n = 3 where the spacetime
is regular at r = 0 ( = a). by equalizing all three harmonics all scalars are trivial and
the metric reads

ds2 = hg2r2h  dt2 + dy2
= g22h  dt2 + dy2

g2r2h 2

3i + dr2
3i + d2
g22 ,

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

(10)

which is nothing other than ads5 (r2h  r2 + q = 2). so, in order to obtain a
non-trivial solution we need dierent hs, or equivalently, we have to turn on scalar
elds. but still, the metric will remain regular at r = 0 where  = q and spacetime
does not end there. this is very similar to the extreme reissner-norstrom solution,
but with the dierence that we do not have a horizon in the case at hand. in fact near
r = 0 the metric (5) becomes

ds2 = (q1q2q3)1/3g2h  dt2 + dy2

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

3i +

r2dr2

g2(q1q2q3)2/3 .

(11)

since this metric, as well as the scalars, are invariant under the z2 symmetry: r  r
we can continue the solution beyond the point r = 0. if we do not break this reection
symmetry, we eectively identify the two asymptotic regions, which is equivalent to a
compact transverse space with a radius given by the cosmological constant. note, the
innite radial part of an ads space can always be mapped on a nite interval. this case
corresponds to the situation described in [29, 30], where the radial coordinate is an angle
and the identication r  r yields an s/z2 orbifold as transversal space. for earlier
work on reection symmetric domain walls see [31]. but a generic domain wall breaks
the discrete symmetry and thus we may treat both sides dierently. one possibility
would be to connect the solution to at space, which means that the potential has to
vanish. this supersymmetry breaking setup has been explored in [32, 33].

in summary, the 3-brane as given in (5) represents a domain wall interpolating between
two ads spaces or an ads space and at spacetime. in order to match the scalars
and the metric, we have to equalize the qs on both side and if one wants to describe
a at space on one side, the constant parts of the harmonics have to vanish on that
side (see also below). when discussing genuine n=2 solutions in the next section, we
will see that we can glue together topological distinct vacua at this point, where each
of them may have a dierent cosmological constant. in the dual eld theory this setup
will correspond to the incorporation of additional perturbations and we expect a ow
between dierent xpoints.

2.3 denitions and conventions of 5-d supergravity

a generic solution has of course more scalars and is in the ungauged case not duality
equivalent to a 3-charge solution, which we discussed in the last section. the n physical
scalars a of 5-d supergravity parameterize a hypersurface in an (n + 1)-dimensional
space parameterized by the coordinates x i. this space will be called scalar manifold
or occasionally moduli space, but we have to keep in mind that the gauging breaks
the u-duality group. let us summarize some basic features; we will mainly follow here
[34, 33, 11], but in slightly modied notation. to be concrete the scalar manifold is
dened by the constraint

v =

1
6

cijkx ix jx k = 1 ,

(12)

where in the case of a calabi-yau compactication the constants cijk are the topo-
logical intersection numbers. for many physical interesting cases this space is given by
a coset like [11]

m =

so(n  1, 1)
so(n  1)  so(1, 1) .

in general there is no restriction in the number of scalar elds, the case discussed in
the last section corresponds to n = 2 and c123 = 1.
the coupling matrices entering the lagrangian (1) are dened by

with ci = cijkx j x k and cij = cijkx k. moreover, the normal vector on the scalar
manifold is given by3

(16)

(17)

3in proper coordinates, the dening equation of a surface f (x i ) = 0 depends only on the transver-
sal coordinates, at least locally. therefore, i f is a normal vector and af  (ax i)i f (x) = 0.

7

and since ax i gives the tangent vectors

finally, the potential p in the lagrangian (1) reads

xiax i = x iaxi = 0 .

p = 6 vivj(cid:16)x ix j  3

4gabax ibx j(cid:17)

4gabaw bw(cid:17) ,

where vi are constants (fi terms) and the superpotential w is

w = vix i .

(18)

(19)

(20)

notice, w is subject to the constraint (12) which makes it non-linear in the physical
scalars a.

2.4 bps domain walls in gauged n =2 supergravity

we are interested in a 3-brane, that couples to n scalars of the vector multiplets and
for which the gauge elds are trivial. this domain wall solution allows for unbroken
supersymmetries if the gaugino and gravitino variations4

(21)

have non-trivial zeros. solutions of these equations are bps congurations of n=2
gauged supergravity and basically there are two dual cases related to the possibilities
to express the scalar elds in terms of xi or its dual x i. both coordinates parameterize
dual cycles of the internal manifold, xi is related to 2-cycles whereas x i to 4-cycles.
taking into account non-trivial gauge elds, the solution expressed by xi corresponds
to electric whereas the other to magnetic solutions. in this paper we will explore only
the electric solution. most likely the magnetic solution is not supersymmetric, at least
as long as one keeps the ansatz for u(1) gauge elds a = viai
, where vi is a constant
electric vector which by supersymmetry will be related to the electric moduli (see
below). for a discussion of electric-magnetic duality in gauged supergravity see [32].

our (electric) solution reads

ds2 = e2u g2r2h  dt2 + dy2

xi = 1

,

hi = hi + qi
r2

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

3i + e4u dr2
g2r2 ,

(22)

4in our case of abelian gauging, the hyperrino variation are trivially solved for constant hyper

scalars.

8

where all gauge elds vanish. as it has been shown in [21] this conguration solves
the equations of motion coming from the lagrangian (1) for any prepotential. what
remains to be shown is that this domain wall allows for unbroken supersymmetry.

let us start with the gaugino variation. using the denition (14) and (17) we nd

gabb = gij ax ix j = 

3
2

ax ixi

and therefore the gaugino variation becomes

a =

3 i
4

ax i(cid:16)xi + 2gvi(cid:17) .

it follows from (18) and our solution (22) that

and thus

(ax i)xi =

1
3

e2u (ax i)hi = 0

ax ixi = e2u 2
3r

ax ihi r .

after transforming r into the tangent space, the gaugino variation becomes

taking the projector

i  ax i(cid:16)rhi + 3vi(cid:17) .

(1 + r) = 0

the constants in the harmonic functions are xed by the vi vector

hi = 3vi .

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

notice, treating r as 5, we project out one chirality from the 4-d perspective. the
chirality discussed in this paper yields a killing spinor (see eq. (37)) which is located
near r = 0; whereas the killing spinor with respect to the other chirality would be
located at r = ; the location is given by an exponentially increase or fall-o in
adapted coordinates.
taking the normalization that e2u  1 for r  +, we nd that

xi|+
i.e., the moduli x the constant vector vi.
next we turn to the gravitino variation and nd for the non-vanishing spin connections

(30)

0r = g2re2u (reu ) dt

,

mr = g2re2u (reu ) dxm .

(31)

as a consequence of the scalar constraint xix i = 1, e2u becomes

e2u =

(32)

and therefore (recall hix i = 0)

(e2u ) =

or

r(cid:16) 1

x ihi  e2u(cid:17) ,

(cid:16)reu(cid:17) =

3

(x ihi) eu = w eu ,

with w dened in (20). using this relation we nd that the worldvolume components
of the gravitino variation

(41)

vanish ( = 0 . . . 3). in order to determine the killing spinor  we have to solve r = 0,
which becomes

r = hr +

e2u w ri = hr +

r(cid:16)u + log r(cid:17) ri = 0 .

1
2r

1
2

using the projection (28) it is straightforward to solve this dierential equation and
the killing spinor reads

 = e 1

2 (u +log r)(cid:16)1  r(cid:17)0

where 0 is an arbitrary constant spinor.
this completes the discussion of supersymmetry. we have shown that the solution (22)
represents a bps domain wall of gauged n=2 supergravity.

one may of course ask whether this is just a special solution or to which extent it is
general. let us add some comments. first, that the projector (28) depends only on
r is dictated by the geometry (isotropic 3-brane) and employing eq. (18) the gaugino
variation becomes

ax i (re2u rxi + 2vi)  ax i (cid:16)  rr(e2u xi) + 2vi(cid:17) = 0 .

with the solution given by

 rr(e2u xi) + 2vi = axi

for some function a. to solve the equation explicitly we contract it with x i and get:
rre2u  2w = a. in order to x a we use the gravitino variation, which yields

w = eu r(reu )

and hence a = 2 e2u . inserting this back in (39) we get the unique solution

e2u xi =

1

3 (cid:16)vi +

qi

r2(cid:17) =

1
3

hi ,

(the 1
3 is a convenient normalization). thus, eq. (22) is not only a special ansatz, it
represents the generic isotropic 3-brane solution of 5-dimensional gauged supergravity
with trivial hypermultiplets and ads boundary condition. these equations are also
known as stabilization equations and have been rst discussed for the black hole entropy
[35] and later for general stationary bps solutions n=2 sugra in [36, 37].

10

3 supersymmetric xpoints, rg ow and the c-theorem

the ads/cft correspondence tells us that the renormalization group ow of yang-
mills couplings translate into a running (radial dependent) scalar elds. in this setup
xpoints correspond to regions where the scalars become constant and extremize the
potential; the metric is then anti de sitter. in this section we will discuss some general
features of this ow and afterwards we will present examples.

let us start by rewriting the metric in a dierent way. dening

and using (34) we get d = w rdr and thus

r eu = 

ds2 = g22(cid:16)  dt2 + dy2

3(cid:17) +

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

(42)

(43)

d2

(gw )22 .

therefore, whenever we approach an extrema of the superpotential where aw = 0 and
thus w becomes constant, we obtain an ads5 space with a radius given by l = 1/(gw0)
and xed scalars. in fact, from the gaugino variation it follows, that if the scalars are
constant the superpotential is extremal

aw = 0

(44)

which implies that also the supergravity potential is extremal (ap = 0). in the dual
yang-mills theory we have reached a conformal xpoint. the scalars are generically
ratios of harmonic functions and therefore only r =  or r = 0 could correspond to
xpoints. but as we will see below, the point r = 0 is not a xpoint but a phase
transition point.

but let us rst expand the potential around a xpoint. the rst derivative vanishes
and the second derivative gives

abw =

(45)

from the denition of the scalar metric we get

where the rst term on the rhs vanishes identically, see eq. (25). inverting this equation
yields (recall xix i = 1)

abx i =

where tabc is dened as the projection of cijk on the scalar manifold [34]

and thus we get at the xpoint (cw = 0) the well-known relation

hence, supersymmetric xpoints (extrema) remain stable as long as the scalar metric
gab is positive denite. notice, it is w that drives the supersymmetric ow and not the
sugra potential p . the expansion can be continued and we nd for the third derivative

with a as eigenvalue of gab calculated at the xpoint. following the standard proce-
dure [3] these masses translate into conformal dimensions of the corresponding operator

(55)

at the xpoint the gravitino mass term is therefore given by the cosmological constant
and, as required by supersymmetry, the masses of the gauginos coincide with the
scalar masses. notice, the scalar masses come from the sugra potential p whereas the
fermionic masses from the superpotential w . let us also mention that the supergravity
potential can vanish identically, p  0, but w 6= 0 [32] (assuming that tabc is

12

covariantly constant). obviously, in this case the scalars remain massless, but the
gauginos feel a potential and supersymmetry is broken, see also [38]. furthermore, let
us also mention that all masses are suppressed by the cosmological constant, which has
to be small for a reliable supergravity picture.

next, following the discussion of [8] we can formulate a c-theorem for the supersymm-
stric ow. by investigating the einstein equations (see eq. (24) in [21]) we nd

w + 3gabaw bw = 0 .

(57)

hence, w 2 is a monotonic decreasing function in . on the other hand the c-theorem
conjectures a c-function which is monotonic under the rg ow and becomes the central
charge of the cft at their extremum. generically it interpolates between two dierent
cft with dierent central charges. these central charges, are basically given by the
radius of the ads space [39]: c  l3, up to universal constants. recalling that at the
xpoint l = (gw )1, a natural ansatz for the c-function is

c(, a)

(gw )3 .

(58)

moreover, expressed in terms of  (recall d = w rdr) the gaugino variation gives us
an expression for the a-function for the coupling a

a = gabb log c .

(59)

using the denition of w together with the constraint (12) this represents an exact
expression for the -function for any prepotential. inserting the expansion for w this

it also means that the superpotential behaves monotonic during the ow.

like the entropy in thermodynamics, the c-theorem reects the irreversibility of a
qft under the rg ow, where the rg parameter  represents the scale below which
(massive) modes have been integrated out, for a recent discussion see [40].
in fact,
there seems to be a close relationship between the gravitational entropy and the central
charge of the eld theory. both quantities can be obtained by an extremization with
respect to the moduli: the central charge from the c-function as described before and
the bekenstein-hawking entropy from the bps mass [41, 42]. as a consequence, both
are moduli independent and depend only on universal quantities like topological data.
on the other hand the bps mass itself as well as the c-function are not universal,
the mass depends on the moduli and the c-function is scheme dependent. to be
concrete, the bekenstein-hawking entropy of black holes in 5 dimensions is given by
s = m 3/2
extr., where mextr. is extremum of the bps mass as a function of the moduli
( qix i) while keeping x the charges qi. this denition of the entropy does not
require a horizon or a black hole as it can directly be derived from the rst law of
thermodynamics [43], but see also [44]. however, this approach has a sublte point -
the temperature. e.g., extremal black holes have a non-vanishing entropy, whereas
there is no natural denition of temperature in an asymptotic at spacetime. on the
other hand, our situation is dierent, because anti de sitter space has an intrinsic

temperature. black holes, e.g., need a minimal temperature t0   to be in a
thermodynamical equilibrium with the ads space [45] and at this critical point also
the mass is directly xed by the cosmological constant m  1/(). recalling that the
t0(cid:17)extr. 
cosmological constant is   w 2
w 3/2
, where the extremum is taken with respect to the moduli while keeping xed
the parameter vi (f-i terms). as mentioned in [44] the extremization with respect to
the moduli yields an extremum for the temperature as well, t0 is therefore a reasonable
candidate for the temperature. since this extremization is exactly equivalent to the
equation (41) calculated at the xpoint [42], this analogy suggests that

(63)

note, the eld theory central charge decreases in the ow towards the ir, while the
gravitational entropy increases towards the uv and recall, the gravitational uv regime
translates into the eld theory ir and vice versa! one could object, that the equations
(41) allow in general for more solutions, but the entropy should be a unique quantity
for a given system. on the other hand, dierent solutions will correspond to dierent
xed scalar elds and therefore translate into dierent xpoints and thus there is no
puzzle (since the eld theory is expected to be very dierent at dierent xpoints).

as next step, let us describe the supersymmetric ow in detail. as one may have
realized, the crucial part of the solution is given by equation (41), which states that

5of course these arguments have to be justied by a microscopic or statistical analysis.

figure 1: the scalar elds are not constant and therefore every point on the scalar manifold
m represents a dierent point in spacetime. a solution of the scalar eld equation
denes a trajectory  = (r) connecting two xpoint values. supersymmetry is
preserved, if along this trajectory the normal vector of m remains parallel the
harmonic function hi = hi + qi
r2 which xes the solution. although m is smooth
and dierentiable the trajectory may make turns related to source terms at the
domain wall.

the normal vector xi on the scalar manifold has to be parallel to hi or in other words:
for a given radius r a supersymmetric solution is given by the point(s) on the scalar
manifold where xi k hi. moreover, since hi is a vector that interpolates between hi
at r =  and qi near r  0, every point on a supersymmetric path (ow) corresponds
to a dierent radius (energy) and along this path the normal vector has to remain
parallel to the (with r changing) vector hi. our solution shows that there is always a
path departing from a xpoint, with the normal vector given by hi towards any normal
vector qi, see gure 1.
but the point r = 0 is not a new xpoint. a xpoint would imply that the metric
becomes anti de sitter, but instead near r = 0 the spacetime becomes at. in order to
see this, let us note that as long as all qi are non-vanishing, none of the xi vanishes
or diverges6. therefore near this point e2u has to scale like 1/r2 and the metric (22)
becomes at. moreover, if it would be a xpoint, the rst term in the gaugino variation
had to vanish, but the rst term in (27) vanishes only if hi  hi (see (25)). this is the
case only if r   or for hi k qi, the latter case would mean that we stay at a given
xpoint. hence, in order to reach a second xpoint we have to continue our solution
through this point and at r =  we reach again an anti de sitter space, i.e., we are
again at a xpoint.

the continuation can be done in a symmetric way, i.e. by identifying the solution under
r  r, but for us more interesting is the non-symmetric case, where the asymptotic
ads spaces dier. in order to have a well-dened transition we have to require that
the scalars and the metric join smoothly which is ensured if the qi vector is the same
on both sides. also, we do not want to change the gauging while running from one

6to verify this, take arbitrary ratios of eq. (41).

xpoint to another and therefore we impose that hi  vi is the same on both sides.
hence, we use the same set of harmonic functions on both sides which implies that
the normal vector xi behaves smoothly at r = 0. as a consequence of all this, the
scalars and w are regular.
in order ensure that we nevertheless move to another
xpoint and not to come back to our starting point, we have to change the topology
of the internal manifold at r = 0. there has to be a phase transition, which changes
the intersection form (12). as an example, we will discuss in the next section a op
transition, which implies that the intersection form gets an additional term v  v 1
6t3
2
(if we assume that the cycle parameterized by t2 vanishes at the transition point). for
this type of transition, not only the scalar manifold but also the rst and second order
derivatives pass the transition point at t2 = 0 smoothly, but higher derivatives, as
typical for phase transitions, may jump; see also the discussion in [46]. as we have
shown earlier, the second derivative of w is positive denite at the xpoints (scalar
mass terms), suggesting that w has only minima and no sattle points and extrema. but
the information about the rst and second order derivative is not enough to get a global
picture of w , instead we have to take into account that the scalar manifold (moduli
space) has boundaries and typically at these boundaries massless states appear and
second order derivatives of w vanishes, see wu v in (83). for a strictly non-degenerate
kahler metric, the number of minima should be related to the number of boundaries
and if there is only one boundary like for torus compactication (see gure 2 in [11])
we get an unique extremum for w .

the smoothness of the scalar manifold does not mean that the trajectory of the ow
given by  = (r) is dierentiable at r = 0. in the symmetric case where we identify
both sides it rather like a reection, where the scalars have maximal velocity at the
wall. at this point the velocity ( r) changes its sign, which produces a -function
in the second derivative and indicates source terms located at the wall [13]. in the
non-symmetric case, there is still a sign change in the velocity, but it is rather a non-
complete reection or a refraction; see also the discussion in [31, 4]. nevertheless, the
underlying manifold should be smooth, only the ow trajectory is making a turn at
r = 0. let us also mention, that the vector qi determines the trajectory or equivalently
the qs are allowed deformations of a given trajectory. but not for all choices of qi we
reach a phase transition point, i.e., for those cases the ow has to come back to the
starting point.

also, one may ask whether the superpotential has more extrema for a given model with
a given intersection form (recall, that we still assume trivial hyper multiplets). any
extremum of the superpotential implies an ads vacuum and allows for some unbroken
supersymmetries and therefore, has to be part of our solution. as we discussed earlier,
supersymmetry requires that the normal vector of the scalar manifold (i.e., xi) becomes
at the xpoint parallel to the constant vector hi or vi, i.e., hiax i = 0. therefore,
extrema of the superpotential coincide with extrema of the scalar manifold with respect
hi, see gure 1. however, the scalar manifold as dened by the cubic equation v =
1, is generically not connected and the dierent branches are separated by singular

model and requires in our setup a phase transition in the internal space.

lines where the prepotential vanishes v = 0. for many physical interesting cases this
manifold is a symmetric non-compact space with constant curvature [47, 11], which
implies that every branch allows for at most one extremum, i.e., a point where the
normal vector is parallel to hi or hiax i = 0.
if a given prepotential allows for
multiple solutions inside a given kahler cone, they have to lie on dierent branches,
i.e., they should be disconnected. no ow is possible between two extrema inside a
given kahler cone, one has to pass a phase transition to reach a second extremum of
the superpotential! for the eld theory this means, that between two xpoints of the
-function there has to be a phase transition in the supergravity description.

4 examples

let us start with a simple example that can be solved completely. it is given by the
prepotential

v = x 0x aabx b

(64)
and corresponds in the ungauged case to a compactication on k3 t2 with an appro-
priate signature for ab. therefore it will give us a supergravity picture of branes at
zk orbifold singularities, as e.g., described in [48]. first we have to solve the equations
(41), which become

h0 = e2u x aabx b

,

ha = 2 x 0e2u abx b .

where g2w 2

since the kahler metric is positive denite the sign of the -function, which determines
whether it is a uv or ir xpoint, is xed by the sign of aw  ab(b  b
0 ), see
case (a) in gure 2.

but not only the supergravity side, also the eld theory can be explored more explicitly.
e.g., this model provides a sugra picture for branes at zk orbifolds as described in [48],
where a subclass of our scalars corresponds to blow-up modes of 2-cycles and the
charge parameter qi entering the harmonic functions corresponds to the number of
branes which are on top of each other. as consequence of the orbifold, the gauge group
factories and the sugra scalars (moduli) parameterize the space of gauge couplings for
the dierent u(qi ) gauge groups. the xpoint values of these gauge couplings are
inversely related to the xed scalars in (68) and the central charge is c  w 3
. the
non-vanishing -function means the conformal symmetry is generically broken, but for
special values of vi the sugra scalars are constant everywhere. this is exactly the
case if qikvi where the radial dependence of the scalars drops out (no running) and
the domain wall becomes exactly ads5. for black holes, this case is known as double
extreme solution (an extremal black hole with extremal mass).

as a second example we will discuss a topological non-trivial case, which has two
xpoints in super yang-mills as shown in gure 2 (b). the dashed line indicates the
supergravity phase transition at r = 0 between the distinct vacua and in our example
it is a op transition, that has been discussed already for black holes with constant
scalars in [46] and later on for non-trivial scalar in [49]. the two phases correspond to
dierent triangulations of an elliptically bered calabi-yau with the base f1; for more
information about this op transition we refer to [50, 51] and for a general discussion
about calabi-yau phase transitions to [52]. for this calabi-yau exists an orientifold
limit [53] and the type i dual description (compactied on k3) has been discussed in
[54]. we expect that in the dual eld theory the space of gauge couplings can again be

18

parameterized by our supergravity scalars7.
let us come to the concrete model. one phase, which corresponds to the second chern
class c2 = (92, 102, 36) is described by the prepotential [51]

vu v =

(70)

and as it will turn out at the end, this model yields the bigger central charge and
therefore we regard it as the uv point. the coordinates that we are using are related
to the calabi-yau moduli by

t1 = x 3

,

t2 = x 2  x 3

,

t3 = x 1

x 2 .

(71)

in order to stay inside the kahler cone all ts have to be positive or equivalently:
2
3x 1 > x 2 > x 3 > 0. we reach the boundaries of the moduli space at t1 = x 3 = 0
(elliptic bration over p2) and at t3 = x 1  3
2x 2 = 0 where tensionless strings emerge.
as a side remark, these t-moduli correspond to dierent 2-cycles and from the f-theory
perspective our domain wall can be seen as 7-branes with four coordinates wrapped in
the internal space. then, the tensionless strings can either be understood as 3-branes
wrapping a vanishing 2-cycle which is not part of the 7-brane, or as zero-size instantons
on the world volume, see [50] for more details. but let us recall, we consider gauged
supergravity which, as mentioned before, corresponds to non-trivial (non-zero mode)
uxes for some cycles. continuing our discussion, we pass the op transition at

t2 = x 2  x 3 = 0 .

(72)

after this transition we enter a dierent cy with c2 = (92, 36, 24), which corresponds
to the prepotential [51]

(74)

the kahler cone is again dened by the domain of positive ts; the moduli space ends
at t1 = 0 (again tensionless strings emerge) and at t3 = 0 where an su(2) symmetry
enhancement occurs. the op transition is at t2 = 0.
let us discuss the two phases separately.

7notice, on the supergravity side the dilaton sits in the universal hypermultiplet which is xed in
our setup (not running) and therefore also on the eld theory side we have to keep x the over-all
norm of the gauge couplings as well. in this respect it would be interesting to explore the domain wall
solution of [9] which has a non-trivial dilaton.

notice, at the transition point we did not change the harmonic functions, neither qi

in order to simplify the situation further, we can go to the symmetry enhancement

after imposing this constraint, we have only one physical scalar and we can describe
the situation as shown in gure 2 (b). for this we regard x 3 =  as the physical scalar

5 conclusion

in this paper we employed domain wall solutions to give a supergravity description
of the rg ow of 4-d super yang-mills. on the supergravity side the domain wall
interpolates between two asymptotic ads spaces on both sides and is a solution of 5-d
gauged supergravity, where a u(1) group of the r-symmetry has been gauged. in this
setup the running of the supergravity scalars between two xpoint values corresponds
to the running of couplings of operators in super yang-mills. these xpoint values are
reached in the two asymptotic ads spaces on both sides of the domain wall. identifying
both sides yields an s/z2 orbifold in the radial direction, but it does not describe a ow
between dierent xpoints. instead, to reach a second xpoint one has to assume that
a phase transition takes place while passing the domain wall. the natural framework to
discuss this transition is n=2 supergravity and we have discussed an explicit example
corresponding to a op transition in the internal space. this phase transition happens
at a boundaries of the kahler cone and therefore, while passing the domain wall in
spacetime one leaves a given kahler cone as well.

exploring the equations of motion and the supersymmetry variations we discuss the
c-theorem and give a supergravity expression for the eld theory -functions. these
expressions are non-perturbative in the sense that they hold for any prepotential of n=2
supergravity but they are restricted to the case of trivial hypermultiplets. expanding
the supergravity potential as well as the superpotential around a given xpoint we
obtain the cosmological constant and the masses for the scalar elds. the (small)
cosmolgical constant, which suppresses all mass terms, is obtained by an extremization
of the superpotential with respect to the moduli which suggests a relation to the 5-d
gravitational entropy.

at the end we discussed two examples in more detail. one is a gauging of the k3
compactication of iib string theory which should be dual n=2 super yang-mills. as
expected this has only one xpoint, which can be ir or ur attractive. in the second
example we discuss a gauged model of elliptically bered calabi-yau with f1 basis,
which allows for an orientifold limit and is dual to type i on k3. this second example
has a op transition and passing this transition corresponds to a running coupling
from the uv towards the ir in the dual n=1 super yang mills.
in both cases the
eld theory gauge group is expected to be a direct product of dierent u(qi ), at least
in the orbifold/orientifold limit, and we argue that deformations of the relative gauge
couplings are parameterized by the supergravity scalars.

there are a couple of interesting directions that are worthwhile to explore. one is
to take into account a non-trivial dilaton, e.g., by exploiting the solution given in
[9]. a further direction is to investigate the electric-magnetic duality. in general by
gauging we break the duality and therefore we cannot expect dyonic solutions, but it
may happen that two dierent models ow to the same xpoint and at this xpoint
they are dual to each other.
in fact for non-supersymmetric vacua (with vanishing
potential) generalized electro-magnetic dualities have been discussed in [33]. of course,

22

to investigate non-supersymmetric vacua, would be interesting in its own. finally, let
us also mention that having the explicit supergravity solutions, it is straightforward to
calculate the eective supergravity action. as they solve the equations of motion only
surface terms will survive, which should generate the amplitutes of super yang mills.
