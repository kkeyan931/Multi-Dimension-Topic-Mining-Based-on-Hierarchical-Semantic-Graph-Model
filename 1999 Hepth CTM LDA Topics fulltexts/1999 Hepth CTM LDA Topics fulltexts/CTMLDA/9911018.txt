(25) second condition (25) interpreted way done qed imposing condition = 0 fock space one kills unwanted states. important stress massless vector normal sense. transforms massless vector new lorentz group . next important question following, real gauge transformation massless gauge boson. recall ordinary (b = 0) open string theory gauge transformations amount shift state null state (a physical state orthogonal physical states therefore zero norm): (k) 1|0, ki (k) 1|0, ki + ik(k) 1|0, ki (26) case one show shifted state zero norm shell, k2 = 0. next section explicitly show noncommutative gauge transformation b 6= 0 case results shift null state well. 5 noncommutative gauge transformation massless state two last sections would like take naive (but hopefully transparent) look noncommutative transformations relation deformation quantization. let us sketch important properties commutative noncommutative gauge transformations going use. case usual abelian gauge transforma- tions following invariance momentum represenation a(x) a(x) + (x) (27) (28) 3if one tries dene mass operator 2 = p p spectrum string turns (k) (k) + ik(k) continuous one would expect sensible string theory. 7 using following notation a(x) = 1 (2)d/2 z ddk eikx(k), (k) = 1 (2)d/2 z ddx eikxa(x) (29) fourier transform . reality condition a(x) (x) corresponds following condition (k) = (k), (k) = (k). condition k(k) = 0 corresponds lorentz condition a. noncommutative u(1) gauge transformations act follows: + + ia star product following standard denition f (x) g(x) = ei f (x + )g(x + )|==0 momentum representation 1 (2)d/2 z ddx eikx(f (x) g(x)) = 1 (2)d/2 z ddp ei pk f (p)g(k p) f (x) = 1 (2)d/2 z ddp eipx f (p), g(x) = 1 (2)d/2 z ddl eilxg(l) (30) (31) (32) (33) using (30) (32) one get noncommutative gauge transformation momentum representation (k) (k) + ik(k) + 2 (2)d/2 z ddp (p)(k p) sin(pk) (34) case even (in odd case problems). important note noncommutative gauge transformations (30) gauge parameter completly arbitrary (unlike commutative case). noncommutative case eld strength gauge invariant object therefore impose gauge invariance action one require gauge potential gauge parameter fall innity fast enough. momentum space means appropriate behavior zero momentum. also functions noncommutative case innitely dierentiable. show transformation (34) gauge transformation show following state null: z ddp (p)(k p) sin(pk) 1|o, ki = f(k) 1|o, ki words one prove following two properties hold f(k)k = 0, f(k)f (k) = 0, (k)f (k) = 0 8 (35) (36) properties (25) hold. properties (36) insure state (35) physical orthogonal physical states. let us show equations (36) true. introducing notation a(k) = f(k)k = z ddp (p)(k p)k sin(pk) (37) one show a(k) = a(k) using reality conditions . one equivalently write (37) as: a(k) = f(k)k = z ddp (p)(k p)p sin(pk) (38) used (k p) (k p) = 0. (38) using reality conditions one show a(k) = a(k) therefore a(k) = 0. since kf (k) = 0 lorentz gauge condition require condition true o-shell (i.e. even k2 6= 0). present proof subtleties excluded since functions nice behavior general including zero momentum. prove second property (36) true. combination f(k)f (k) = g(k2) lorentz invariant therefore depend k2. interested value g(k2) k2 = 0. thus constant one calculate picking concrete value k saties k2 = 0. k = (0, 0, ..., 0) nd zero. last condition conditions (36) proven way. thus proven conditions (36). avoid confusion one understand properties (36) true equalities functions. since dealing poincare invariant quantum theory one look correlation functions operators. instance, last expresion (36) understood following correlator coordinate space momentum space ha(x)a(y)i = g((x y)2) h(k)(k)i = g(k2) (39) (40) mean gauge transformation. fact dealing correlation functions poncare invariant vacuum give us simple dependence momentum. 6 general gauge transformation deformation quan- tization one try address following question: general form null state corresponds gauge transformations. section would like argue general 9 gauge transformation related deformation quantization respect . relation open string model b eld background deformation quantization originaly pointed . one local solution conditions (36) correspond k(k). solutions nonlocal momentum space. since interested innitesimal gauge transformations, null state linear gauge eld gauge parameter . thus general solution form f(k) = z ddp (p)(k p)g(p, k p) g(p, k p) kernel following property g(p, k + p) = g(p,k p) = g(p, k + p). (41) (42) property (42) comes reality condition f two extra properties function g(p, k p) (k) = f(k) = f(k). require g(p,k p) = g(p, k p), g(p, k + p) = g(p, k p) (43) ensures condition kf = 0 o-shell (i.e. even k2 6= 0). result (43) g(p,p) = 0 gives us two properties (36) on-shell. important notice function g(p, k p) dened gauge eld gauge parameter redenitions . (44) words shoud f(k) = z ddp (p)s(p)(k p)s(k p) g(p, k p) s(p)s(k p) redenitions modify on-shell physics. modify on-shell state (k) 1|o, ki s(k)(k) 1|o, ki, s(0) = 1 (45) function s(k) natural expansion powers . coordinate space redenitions correspond following transformation: + d1(a) + ()2d2(a) + ... (46) di dierential operators. redenitions produce group automorphisms space gauge elds. since would like understand general form o-shell gauge transformation important look possible eld redenitions aect on-shell physics. g(p, k p) dimensionless scalar function expanded powers . lorentz invariance requires function momenta indices contracted using either (g1). coordinate representation expansion form = b1(, a) + ()2b2(, a) + ... (47) 10 bi bidierential operators, general possible form easily written down. null states (41) correspond gauge symmetry. nite gauge transfor- mations belong group. therefore level innitesimal transformations one require: = {,}a (48) {, } bracket respect associative algebra. turns requirement (48) quite restrictive form kernel g(p, k p). (48) momentum space one read bracket follows {, }(p) = z dd p (p)(p p)"g(p p)g(p, k p) g(p, k p)g(p p, k p + p) (49) kernel k(p, p p) bracket (expression square brackets) depend vector k antisymmetric (k(p, p p) = k(p p, p)). using requirements one arrive conclusion k(p, p p) = g(p, p p). thus coordinate space gauge transformation form bracket: = {, a} requirement (48) jacobi identity bracket. using antisymmetry g write leading term gauge transformation follows g(p, k p) # = g1a + o(2). (50) general bracket dened terms associative product follows: {f1, f2} = f1 f2 f2 f1, let g kernel product momentum space: (51) 1 (2)d/2 z ddx eikx(f1(x) f2(x)) = 1 (2)d/2 z ddp ei pk f1(p) f2(k p)g(p, k p) (52) fi(x) = 1 (2)d/2 z ddp eipx fi(p). g g kernels related following simple way g(p, k p) = g(k, k p) g(k p, p) (53) (54) thus one see looking general gauge transformation arriving problem classication associative product dened power series . interested product eld redenitions (46). exactly star product construction considered kontsevich . due kontsevich present case appropriate star product (up eld redenitions) given moyal product. 11 however analyze concrete form star product strightforward way. since g(p, kp) scalar depends scalars constructed k p contracting indices either metric g anti-symmetric . thus g function four possible kinematic invariants one construct vectors p kp. associativity -product implies following constraint kernel g: g(q, p q)g(p, k p) = g(p q, k p)g(q, k q). (55) analyze (55) one rewrite everything terms possible kinematic invariants. turns associativity written form strong enough restrict g form: g(p, k p) = eicp q f (k2). (56) used eld redenitions form (44). expressing g kernel bracket respect product gives exactly non-commutative gauge transformations previous section trivial redenitions. thus shown direction null states corresponding gauge transformations always form (30). certainly present analysis naive make precise one show corresponding null states form qbrst|i qbrst brst generator. standard brst analysis open string theory right one address question noncomutativity. saw noncomutativity involves orders . therefore one modify somehow standard brst approach address questions. previously reasoning argued standard brst complex modied {$9511077$}. hope come back question elsewhere. 7 conclusions discussion paper analyzed open string theory presence constant b-eld. discussed space-time symmetries problem discussed gauge invariance massless vector boson state using naive covariant quantization. main motivation re-derive non-commutative gauge invariance system transparent way. following logic two last sections one expect well non- commutative properties gauge transformations gravitational antisymmetric elds. noncommutativity b-eld indicated recently {$9910258$}. straightforward analyze closed strings presence b-eld ux non-trivial 2-cycle. logic presented last two sections one might 12 expect well noncommutative properties closed strings. theory interesting features discussed subsequent article. acknowledgments research af supported swedish national research council.
