abstract

in the rst part of this talk i discuss two somewhat dierent supergravity approaches
to calculating correlation functions in strongly coupled yang-mills theory. the older
approach relates two-point functions to cross-sections for absorption of certain incident
quanta by threebranes. in this approach the normalization of operators corresponding
to the incident particles is xed unambiguously by the d3-brane dbi action. by calcu-
lating absorption cross-sections of all partial waves of the dilaton we nd corresponding
two-point functions at strong t hooft coupling and show that they are identical to the
weak coupling results. the newer approach to correlation functions relates them to
boundary conditions in ads space. using this method we show that for a certain range
of negative mass-squared there are two possible operator dimensions corresponding to
a given scalar eld in ads, and indicate how to calculate correlation functions for ei-
ther of these choices. in the second part of the talk i discuss an example of ads/cft
duality which arises in the context of type 0 string theory. the cft on n coincident
electric and magnetic d3-branes is argued to be stable for suciently weak t hooft
coupling. it is suggested that its transition to instability at a critical coupling is related
to singularity of planar diagrams.

1 from absorption cross-sections to two-point cor-

relators

the search for exact relations between gauge elds and strings is an old and important
problem [1, 2]. a simple idea behind some of the recent advances in this direction
[3, 4, 5] is that a stack of n coincident d3-branes may be described in two dierent
ways. in the d-brane formalism [6] such a stack is described by n = 4 supersymmetric
four-dimensional u(n) gauge theory [7] which at low energies interacts weakly with
the bulk closed string excitations. on the other hand, if n is large, then this stack
is a heavy object embedded into a theory of closed strings which contains gravity.
naturally, this macroscopic object will curve space:
it may be described by classical
metric and other background elds including the ramond-ramond 4-form potential
[8].

thus, we have two dierent descriptions of the stack of d3-branes: one in terms of
the u(n) supersymmetric gauge theory on its world volume, and the other in terms
of the r-r charged 3-brane background of the type iib closed superstring theory. an
early indication that these two descriptions are indeed equivalent in some appropriate
limit was the calculation of absoprtion cross-sections for low-energy waves incident on
the stack from the transverse directions [9, 10].

to calculate the absorption cross-sections in the d-brane formalism one needs the
low-energy world volume action for coincident d-branes coupled to the massless bulk
elds. luckily, these couplings may be deduced from the d-brane born-infeld action.
for example, the coupling of d3-branes to the dilaton , the ramond-ramond scalar
c, and the graviton h is given by [9, 10]

consider, for instance, absorption of a dilaton incident on the 3-brane at right angles
with a low energy . since the dilaton couples to 1
 it can be converted into a
pair of back-to-back gluons on the world volume. the leading order calculation of the
cross-section for weak coupling gives [9]

l. thus, the 3-brane geometry may be viewed as a semi-innite throat of radius l
which for r  l opens up into at 9 + 1 dimensional space. waves incident from the
r  l region partly reect back and partly penetrate into the the throat region r  l.
the relevant l-th partial wave radial equation turns out to be [9]

(6)

we nd that the supergravity cross-section agrees exactly with the d-brane one.

in order to get a deeper understanding into why these two very dierent calculations
produce exact agreement, let us rst examine their range of validity. since   gst2,
(6) gives l4  ngst2. supergravity can only be trusted if the length scale of the
3-brane solution is much larger than the string scale , i.e. for ngst  1. of course,
the incident energy also has to be small compared to 1/. thus, the supergravity
calculation should be valid in the double-scaling limit [9]

l4
2 = 4gstn   ,

2  0 .

(7)

if the description of the extremal 3-brane background by a stack of many coincident
d3-branes is correct, then it must agree with the supergravity results in this limit.
since 4gst = 2g2
ym, this corresponds to the limit of innite t hooft coupling in the
n = 4 u(n) sym theory.1

1since we also want to send gst  0 in order to suppress the string loop corrections, we necessarily

have to take the large n limit.

2

on the other hand, in the gauge theory we have calculated the absorption cross-
section to leading order in the t hooft coupling. so, why should this result agree
exactly with the strong coupling prediction of supergravity? the answer is that all
higher-order corrections in the coupling cancel out exactly, i.e. the leading order cal-
culation is protected by a non-renormlaization theorem. such a theorem was rst
enhibited explicitly in the context of graviton absorption [13], but since the graviton
and the dilaton belong to the same supermultiplet, supersymmetry should be sucient
to guarantee that the absorption of the dilaton is similarly protected. the absorp-
tion cross-section for a graviton polarized along the brane, say hxy, is related to the
discontinuity accross the real axis (i.e. the absorptive part) of the two-point function
htxy(p)txy(p)i in the sym theory. in turn, this is determined by a conformal central
charge which satises a non-renormalization theorem:
it is completely independent
of the t hooft coupling. a simple plausibility argument for this fact is that, if there
exists a c-theorem (and it is indeed suspected to exist in 4 dimensions [14]), then the
central charge should be constant along critical lines.

in general, the two-point function of a gauge invariant operator in the strongly cou-
pled sym theory may be read o from the absorption cross-section for the supergravity
eld which couples to this operator in the world volume action [13, 15]. for a canoni-
cally normalized bulk scalar eld coupling to the d3-branes through an interaction

sint = z d4x(x, 0)o(x)

(8)

((x, 0) denotes the value of the eld at the transverse coordinates where the d3-branes
are located) the precise relation is given by

here  is the energy of the particle, and

(9)

(10)

which depends only on s = p2. to evaluate (9) we extend  to complex values of s
and compute the discontinuity of  across the real axis at s = 2.

some examples of the eld operator correspondence may be read o from (1). thus,
we learn that the dilaton absorption cross-section measures the normalized 2-point
function ho(p)o(p)i where o is the operator that couples to the dilaton:

o =

1
4

tr(f 2 + . . .)

(11)

(we have not written out the scalar and fermion terms explicitly). the agreement of
this two-point functions with the weak-coupling calculations performed in [9, 10] is

3

explained by a non-renormalization theorem related by supersymmetry to the non-
renormalization of the central charge discussed in [13]. thus, the proposition that the
g2
ymn   limit of the large n n = 4 sym theory can be extracted from the 3-brane
of type iib supergravity has passed an important consistency check.

it is of further interest to perform similar comparisons for more complicated two-
point functions. consider, for instance, absorption of the dilaton in the l-th partial
wave which can be extracted from the radial equation (5). the thickness of the barrier
through which the particle has to tunnel increases with l, and we expect the cross-
section to become increasingly suppressed at low energies. indeed, a detailed matching
calculation [10, 15] gives

replacing l4 through (6) this can be rewritten as

l =

n l+2l+24l+3(l + 3)

3  25l+55l/2+1l![(l + 1)!]3 .

(12)

(13)

what are the operators whose 2-point functions are related to these cross-sections?
for a single d3-brane one may expand the dilaton coupling in a taylor series in the
transverse coordinates to obtain the following bosonic term [9]:

1
4l!

ff x (i1 . . . x il) ,

(14)

where the parenthesis pick out a transverse traceless polynomial, which is an irreducible
representation of so(6). the correct non-abelian generalization of this term is [15]

1
4l!

strhff x (i1 . . . x il)i ,

(15)

6

where str denotes a symmetrized trace [16]: in this particular case we have to average
over all positions of the f s modulo cyclic permutations. a detailed calculation in [15]
reveals that the 2-point function of this operator calculated at weak coupling accounts
for
(l+2)(l+3) of the semiclassical absorption cross-section (13) in the sense of the relation
(9). luckily, (15) is not the complete world volume coupling to the dilaton in the l-th
partial wave. the n = 4 supersymmetry of the dbi action guarantees that there are
additional terms quadratic and quartic in the fermion elds [17].2 when all these terms
are taken into account there is exact agreement between the weak and strong coupling

2 in order to see why there are no more than 4 fermion elds, we note that the complete
operator may be found by acting with 4 supercharges on the superconformal primary operator
str[x (i1 . . . x il+2)].

4

calculations of the 2-point functions (for details of these rather involved calculations see
[15]). this strongly suggests that the complete l-th partial wave operators are protected
by supersymmetric non-renormalization theorems. for recent progress towards proving
such theorems see [18].

2 correlation functions and the bulk/boundary cor-

respondence

following the circle of ideas reviewed in the previous section, maldacena made a simple
and powerful observation [3] that the universal region of the 3-brane geometry, which
should be directly identied with the n = 4 sym theory, is the ads5  s5 throat, i.e.
the region r  l. following this work, methods for calculating correlation functions of
various operators in the gauge theory were proposed in [4, 5]. [4] proposed to identify
the generating functional of connected correlation functions in the gauge theory with
the extremum of the classical string theory action i subject to the boundary conditions
that (~x, z) = 0(~x) at z = zcutof f (at z =  all uctuations are required to vanish):3
(16)

w [0(~x)] = i0(~x) .

w generates the connected greens functions of the gauge theory operator that corre-
sponds to the eld  in the sense explained in section 2.2, while i0(~x) is the extremum
of the classical string action subject to the boundary conditions (if we are interested
in the correlation functions at innite t hooft coupling, then extremizing the classical
string action reduces to solving the equations of motion in type iib supergravity). an
essentially identical prescription was also proposed in [5] except there the boundary
conditions were imposed at z = 0.

the physical meaning of the cut-o on the z-coordinate introduced in [4] is that it
acts as a uv regulator in the gauge theory. a safe method for performing calculations
of correlation functions, therefore, is to keep the cut-o on the z-coordinate at inter-
mediate stages and remove it only at the end [4, 19]. this way the calculations are not
manifestly ads-invariant, however. one may instead look for a regularization of the
action which is manifestly ads invariant [20]. luckily, when all subtleties are taken
into account, these two ways of performing calculations do agree [20].

3 as usual, in calculating correlation functions in a cft it is convenient to carry out the euclidean

continuation. on the string theory side we then have to use the euclidean version of ads5.

5

2.1 two-point functions

below we present a brief discussion of two-point functions of scalar operators. the
corresponding eld in adsd+1 is a scalar eld of mass m with the action

1

2 z dd+1xghg + m22i =

1

2 z ddxdzzd+1"(z)2 + (i)2 +

m2

z2 2# ,

(17)
where we have set l = 1. in calculating correlation functions of vertex operators from
the ads/cft correspondence, the rst problem is to reconstruct an on-shell eld in
adsd+1 from its boundary behavior. the small z behavior of the classical solution is

(z, ~x)  zd[0(~x) + o(z2)] + z[a(~x) + o(z2)] ,

where  is one of the roots of

(  d) = m2 .

(18)

(19)

0(~x) is regarded as a source function and a(~x) describes a physical uctuation.

it is possible to regularize the euclidean action [20] to obtain the following value as

a functional of the source,

i(0) = (  (d/2))d/2

()

(  (d/2)) z dd~xz dd~x 0(~x)0(~x)
|~x  ~x|2 .

(20)

varying twice with respect to 0 we nd that the two-point function of the correspond-
ing operator is

ho(~x)o(~x)i =

(2  d)()
d/2(  (d/2))

1

|~x  ~x|2 .

(21)

precisely the same normalization of the two-point function follows from a dierent
regularization where zcutof f is kept at intermediate stages [4, 19].

we note that  is the dimension of the operator. which of the two roots of (19)
should we choose? supercially it seems that we should always choose the bigger root,

+ =

d
2

+s d2

4

+ m2 ,

(22)

because then the 0 term in (18) dominates over the a term. while for positive m2
+ is certainly the right choice (here the other root  is negative), it turns out that
for

d2
4



< m2 < 

d2
4

+ 1

(23)

both roots of (19) may be chosen. thus, there are two possible cfts corresponding
to the same classical ads action [20]:
in one of them the corresponding operator

6

a(~x) =

1

2  dho(~x)i .

(24)

has dimension + while in the other  dimension . (the fact that there are two
admissible boundary conditions in adsd+1 for a scalar eld with m2 in the range
(23) has been known since the old work of breitenlohner and freedman [21].) this
conclusion resolves the following puzzle. + is bounded from below by d/2 but there
is no corresponding bound in d-dimensional cft (in fact, as we will see, there are
examples of eld theories with operators that violate this bound). however, in the
range (23)  is bounded from below by (d  2)/2, and this is precisely the unitarity
bound on dimensions of scalar operators in d-dimensional eld theory! thus, the ability
to have dimension  is crucial for consistency of the ads/cft duality.

a question remains, however, as to what is the correct denition of correlation
functions in the theory with dimension . the answer to this question is related to
the physical interpretation of the function a(~x) entering the boundary behavior of the
eld (18). as suggested in [22] this function is related to the expectation value of the
operator o. the precise relation, which holds even after interactions are taken into
account, is [20]

thus, from the point of view of the d-dimensional cft, (2  d)a(~x) is the variable
conjugate to 0(~x). in order to interchange  with d  , it is clear from (18) that we
have to interchange 0 and (2d)a. this is a canonical transformation which for tree-
level correlators reduces to a legendre transform. thus, the generating functional of
correlators in the  theory may be obtained by legendre transforming the generating
functional of correlators in the + theory. this gives a simple and explicit prescription
for dening correlation functions of operators with dimension . for the 2-point
function, for example, we nd that the formula (21) is correct for both denitions of
the theory, i.e. it makes sense for all dimensions above the untarity bound,

 >

d
2  1 .

(25)

indeed, note that for such dimensions the two-point function (21) is positive, but as
soon as  crosses the unitarity bound, (21) becomes negative signaling a non-unitarity
of the theory. thus, appropriate treatment of elds in adsd+1 gives information on
2-point functions completely consistent with expectations from cftd. the fact that
the legendre transform prescription of [20] works properly for higher-point correlation
functions was recently demonstrated in [23].

2.2 chiral operator dimensions in the t 1,1 model

whether string theory on ads5  x5 contains elds with mass-squared in the range
(23) depends on x5. the example x5 = t 1,1 = (su(2)  su(2))/u(1) [24, 25], turns

7

a=1 z2

out to contain such elds, and the possibility of having dimension  is crucial for
the consistency of the ads/cft duality.
in this case the dual gauge theory is the
conformal limit of the world volume theory on a stack of n d3-branes placed at the
singularity of the conifold [25]. the conifold may be described by an equation in four
complex variables, p4
a = 0. since it is symmetric under an overall rescaling of the
z-coordinates, this space is a cone. the base of this cone is precisely the space t 1,1,
and this implies that type iib string theory on ads5  t 1,1 is dual to the infrared
limit of the eld theory on n d3-branes placed at the singularity of the conifold. since
calabi-yau spaces preserve 1/4 of the original supersymmetries we nd that this should
be an n = 1 superconformal eld theory. this eld theory was constructed in [25]: it
is su(n)  su(n) gauge theory coupled to two chiral superelds, ai, in the (n, n)
representation and two chiral superelds, bj, in the (n, n) representation [25]. the
as transform as a doublet under one of the global su(2)s while the bs transform as
a doublet under the other su(2), and each eld has r-charge 1/2. one must also add
an exactly marginal superpotential w = ijkl tr aibkajbl.

there is a number of convincing checks of the duality between this eld theory and
type iib strings on ads5  t 1,1. we will point out one subtle check which is related to
our discussion of operator dimensions. the simplest chiral operators were constructed
in [25]:

tr(ai1bj1 . . . aikbjk) .

(26)

the f-term constraints in the gauge theory require that the i and the j indices are
separately symmetrized; therefore, the su(2)su(2) quantum numbers are (k/2, k/2).
the r-charge is k which determines the operator dimensions to be  = 3k/2. this
spectrum of quantum numbers and dimensions of the chiral operators also follows via
the ads/cft correspondence from the spectrum of type iib theory on ads5  t 1,1
[25, 26, 27]. let us emphasize one interesting subtlety: the dimension of the k = 1
operators, 3/2, is below d/2 = 2. thus, it must correspond to the smaller root of (19),
. analysis of the spectrum of type iib theory on ads5  t 1,1 [26, 27] reveals the
presence of a scalar with m2 = 15/4 which is in the range (23). for this value of m2,
 = 3/2 in perfect agreement with the eld theory.

3 ads/cft duality in type 0 context

in the rst part of this talk i discussed supergravity approaches to theories that occur on
stacks of coincident d3-branes of type iib theory. an interesting generalization of this
work is to consider instead d3-branes of type 0b string theory [28]. since type 0 strings
are obtained by non-chiral gso projections which break all spacetime supersymmetry
[29], the resulting eld theories on branes are necessarily non-supersymmetric. how-

8

ever, type 0 theories have a well-known and seemingly fatal aw in that their closed
string spectrum contains a tachyon of m2 = 2/. i will discuss the simplest example
of ads/cft duality found in the type 0 context [30] and argue that it suggests a novel
mechanism for tachyon stabilization.

the type 0 theories have twice as many massless r-r elds as their type ii cousins,
hence they also possess twice as many d-branes [28]. for example, since the type
0b spectrum has an unrestricted 4-form gauge potential, there are two types of d3-
branes: those that couple electrically to this gauge potential, and those that couple
magnetically. very importantly, the weakly coupled spectrum of open strings on type
0 d-branes does not contain tachyons after the gso projection (1)fopen = 1 is imple-
mented [28, 31, 32]. thus, gauge theories living on such d-branes do not have obvious
instabilities at weak coupling. this suggests via the gauge eld/string duality that the
bulk tachyon instability of type 0 theory may be cured as well [28, 30].

let us review an argument for the tachyon stabilization in the simplest setting, which
is the stack of n electric and n magnetic d3-branes [30]. for such a stack the net
tachyon tadpole cancels so that there exists a classical solution with t = 0. in fact,
since the stack couples to the selfdual part of the 5-form eld strength, the type 0b
3-brane classical solution is identical to the type iib one. taking the throat limit
suggests that the low-energy eld theory on n electric and n magnetic d3-branes is
dual to the ads5  s5 background of type 0b theory and is therefore conformal in the
planar limit [30]. this theory is the u(n)  u(n) gauge theory coupled to 6 adjoint
scalars of the rst u(n), 6 adjoint scalars of the second u(n), and fermions in the
bifundamental representations  4 weyl fermions in the (n, n) and 4 weyl fermions in
the (n, n) (the u(1) factors decouple in the infrared). such a theory is a z2 projection
of the n = 4 u(2n) gauge theory [30]. the z2 is generated by (1)fs, where fs is
the fermion number, together with conjugation by (cid:18) i
0 i (cid:19) where i is the n  n
identity matrix. this is related to the fact that type 0 string theories may be viewed
as (1)fs orbifolds of the corresponding type ii theories [29]. in [33] it was pointed
out that, since (1)fs is an element of the center of the su(4) r-symmetry, this z2
projection of the n = 4 theory belongs to the class of orbifold cfts studied in [34].
the fact that this non-supersymmetric ads/cft duality is a z2 quotient of the
n = 4 duality [30, 33] lends additional credence to its validity. in particular, general
arguments presented in [35] guarantee that the eld theory is conformal in the planar
limit and that planar correlators of untwisted vertex operators coincide with those of
the n = 4 theory. since this cft does not appear to have any instabilities at weak
coupling, it was argued in [30] that type 0b string theory on ads5  s5 is stable
for suciently small radius. this provides a simple ads/cft argument in favor of
tachyon stabilization; it is also an example of how gauge theory may be used to make

0

9

predictions about the string theory dual to it.

however, some important aspects of this particular z2 quotient are related to the
twisted sector of the orbifold and are not covered by the analysis in [35]. since this
theory is dual to the type 0b string, which is tachyonic in at space, in the limit where
the radius of ads5  s5 becomes large in string units this background is unstable [30].
from the cft point of view it means that the limit of innite t hooft coupling, which
is commonly discussed in the ads/cft context, does not make sense. indeed, from
(19) we conclude that the dimension of the operator corresponding to the tachyon eld
via the ads/cft map is complex for large  = g2

y m n.

on the other hand, it is easy to show that this dimension is real for suciently weak
coupling. using the dbi action for d-branes of type 0 theory it was shown in [30] that
this operator is

ot =

1
4

trf 2

 

1
4

trg2

 +

1
2

tr(dx i)2 

1
2

tr(dy i)2 + . . . ,

(27)

where f and x i are the eld strength and the 6 adjoint scalars of su(n)1 while
g and y i are the corresponding objects of su(n)2. this operator is odd under
the interchange of the two su(n)s which is related to the fact that the tachyon is a
twisted state from the point of view of orbifolding type iib string theory by (1)fs.
for weak coupling the dimension of this operator approaches 4, and its anomalous
dimension can be calculated as a power series in . in [30] the leading contribution to
the anomalous dimension of this operators was analyzed (it can be read o from the
2-loop beta functions), and it was shown that

() = 4 +

2
84 + o(3) .

(28)

thus, the dimension is real for weak coupling but, according to the ads/cft cor-
respondence, is complex for strong coupling. a plausible scenario, therefore, is that,
as  = g2
y m n is increased, a transition happens at a critical value c [30]. from the
eld theory point of view this transition is probably due to a singularity of the sum
of planar diagrams that determines () [30]. in non-supersymmetric large n eld
theories such singularities are expected to occur on general grounds [36].

to summarize the second part of the talk, we have suggested that nite radius of con-
vergence of planar graphs, which is a well-known phenomenon in large n eld theories,
has interesting implications in view of the ads/cft correspondence. namely, if there
is an operator whose dimension is real up to a critical value of the t hooft coupling but
becomes complex beyond that value, then the dual ads phenomenon is that a tachyon
present in the large radius (gravity) limit is stabilized for suciently small radii. it
is dicult to study such backgrounds with string-scale curvature directly, but on the
dual cft side perturbative calculations are quite tractable. the perturbative stability

10

of the cft thus provides an argument for stabilization of tachyons (this is one of the
few results to date where eld theory has been used to make new predictions about
string theory), and niteness of the radius of convergence of planar graphs suggests
how instability may develop at suciently strong coupling.
