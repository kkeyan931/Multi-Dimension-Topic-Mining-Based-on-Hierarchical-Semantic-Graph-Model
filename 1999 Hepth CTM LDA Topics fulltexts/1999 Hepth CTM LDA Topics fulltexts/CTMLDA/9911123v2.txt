abstract

we discuss the impact of quadratic quantum uctuations on the
wilson loop extracted from classical string theory. we show that a
large class of models, which includes the near horizon limit of dp
branes with 16 supersymmetries, admits a luscher type correction
to the classical potential. we conrm that the quantum determinant
associated with a bps conguration of a single quark in the ads5 s5
model is free from divergences. we nd that for the wilson loop
in that model, unlike the situation in at space-time, the fermionic
determinant does not cancel the bosonic one. for string models that
correspond to gauge theories in the conning phase, we show that the
correction to the potential is of a luscher type and is attractive.

1 introduction

q1  2c

the idea of describing the wilson loop of qcd in terms of a string partition
function dates back to the early eighties. in a landmark paper in this direc-
tion [1] it was found that the potential of quark anti-quark separated at a
distance l acquires a  c
l correction term (c is a positive universal constant
independent of the coupling) due to quantum uctuations of a nambugoto
(ng) like action. this term is commonly called the lushcer term. an ex-
act expression of the partition function of the ng action was derived in the
large d limit [2], where d is the space-time dimension, and the 1-loop and 1/d
expansions were considered for strings and p-branes in various space-time
topologies [3, 4]. the large d result, when translated to the quark anti-quark
potential, takes the form e(l)  l
l2/ . thus, by expanding it for
2c
small
l2/ , one nds the linear connement potential as well as the luscher
term. it was further shown that in this approximation the semiclassical po-
tential associated with polyakovs action and ng action are identical [5].
it was later realized that in fact this expression is identical to the energy
of the tachyonic mode of the bosonic string in at spacetime with dirichlet
boundary conditions at l/2 [6].
recently there has been a renaissance of the idea of a stringy description
of the wilson loop in the framework of maldacenas correspondence between
large n gauge theories and string theory [7]. technically, the main dier-
ence between the old calculations and the modern ones is the fact that the
spacetime background is no longer at but rather an ads5  s5 or certain
generalizations of it. conceptually, the modern gauge/string duality gave the
stringy description a more solid basis. the rst modern computation [8, 9]
was for the ads5  s5 metric which corresponds to the n = 4 supersym-
metric theory. to make contact with non-supersymmetric gauge dynamics
one makes use of wittens idea [10] of putting the euclidean time direction
on a circle with anti-periodic boundary conditions. this recipe was utilized
to determine the behaviour of the potential for the n = 4 theory at nite
temperature [11, 12] as well as 3d pure ym theory [13] which is the limit of
the former at innite temperature. later, a similar procedure was invoked to
compute wilson loops of 4d ym theory, t hooft loops [13, 14] and the quark
anti-quark potential in mqcd and in polyakovs type 0 model [15, 16, 17].
a unied scheme for all these models and variety of others was analyzed in
[17]. a theorem that determines the leading and next to leading behaviour
of the classical potential associated with this unied setup was proven and
applied to several models. in particular a corollary of this theorem states the
sucient conditions for the potential to have a conning nature.

1

the issue of the quantum uctuations and the detection of a luscher
term was raised again in the modern framework in [18]. it was noticed there
that a more accurate evaluation of the classical result [17] did not have the
form of a luscher term. this is, of course, what one should have anticipated,
since after all the origin of the luscher term [1] is the quantum uctuations
of the ng like string. the determinant associated with the bosonic quantum
uctuations of the pure ym setup was addressed in [19]. it was shown there
that the system is approximately described by six operators that correspond
to massless bosons in at spacetime and two additional massive modes. the
fermionic determinant was not computed in this paper. however, the au-
thors raised the possibility that the latter will be of the form of massless
fermions and hence there might be a violation of the concavity behaviour
of gauge potentials [20, 21]. one of the results of our work is that in fact
the fermionic operators are massive ones and thus the bosonic determinant
dominates and there is an attractive interaction after all. the impact of the
quantum uctuations for the case of the ads5  s5 case was discussed in
[22, 23]. using the gs action [24, 25, 26, 27] with a particular  symmetry
xing, it was observed that the corresponding quantum wilson loop suers
from uv logarithmic divergences. it was argued that by renormalizing the
mass of the quarks one can remove the divergence.

the computations of wilson loops in 3d and 4d pure ym theory can be
confronted with the results found in lattice calculations. in particular, the
main question is whether the correction to the linear potential in the form of a
luscher term can be detected in lattice simulations. according to [28] there is
some numerical evidence for a luscher term associated with a bosonic string,
however the results are not precise enough to be convincing. obviously, our
ultimate dream is compatibility with heavy meson phenomenology.

in this paper our main goal has been the quantum corrections of the quark
anti-quark potential in the class of non-supersymmetric conning theories.
on the route to this target we had to overcome several related obstacles. an
important technical problem is the issue of gauge xing. whereas for at
space-time backgrounds there are several known xing procedure which are
under full control, it turns out that for the non at background the situation
is more subtle. already in xing the world sheet dieomorphism we were
facing gauge choices that looked innocent but later were found to be prob-
lematic. the situation with the xing of the symmetry is even trickier.
we wrote the form of the bosonic action truncated to quadratic uctuations
for the unifying scheme of [17]. as warm up exercises we considered the uc-
tuations of a string in at space-time and the uctuations of a bps quark of
the ads5  s5 model. whereas in the former case it is quite straightforward
to realize that the bosonic part yields the luscher term and the fermionic

2

part exactly cancels it, in the later case the picture is more involved. even-
tually, the basic expectation that there are no divergent corrections to the
energy was veried. however, this result emerged only in a particular class
of symmetry xing schemes. without performing an explicit computation,
using a scaling argument we were able to write down the general l depen-
dence for a large class of models. it turns out that the set of models based
on dp branes with 16 supersymmetries have a lushcer type behaviour. note
that unlike the p = 3 case, for p 6= 3 there is no reason from dimensional
grounds for the potential to be of the form 1/l, and indeed the classical
result is not of this form.

as for the case of the wilson loop of the ads5  s5 model we found
that there is only partial cancellation between the bosonic and fermionic
determinant. the net free energy is of a luscher form, but we were unable
to determine neither its coecient nor even its sign.

in spite of the fact that there is no gs action which corresponds to the
non at background associated with conning gauge theories, we argue that
there is a net attractive luscher type correction to the linear potential in the
pure ym case.

the outline of the paper is as follows. we start with a brief description
of the classical setup. for that purpose we use the nambu goto action
associated with a space-time metric which is diagonal and depends on only
one coordinate. the ads5  s5 is a special case of this conguration and
so are backgrounds that correspond to conning gauge dynamics. in section
3 we introduce quantum uctuations to the string coordinates. we expand
the action to quadratic order in the uctuations and write down the general
form of the operators whose (log) determinant determines the free energy
of the system. when translating to the gauge language the free energy has
the interpretation of the quantum correction of the classical quark anti-quark
potential. we discuss three possible gauge xing schemes and argue that only
one of them, the normal coordinate xing is a safe gauge. as a warmup
exercise of computing and renormalizing the determinant, we derive in section
4 the luscher term in the at space-time background. section 5 is devoted to
an analysis of the dependence of the free energy on the separation distance
l based on a general scaling argument. an application of this result to the
case of dp branes with 16 supersymmetries [29] shows that the quantum
correction for this conguration must also be of luscher type. we then use,
in section 6, the general expressions of the operators for the ads5  s5 case.
we rederive these results in the framework of polyakovs action in section
7. the next task of incorporating the fermionic uctuations is discussed in
section 8, again rst in the simplest case of at space-time. we then proceed
to the case of a single bps quark in the ads5  s5 background. we discuss

3

the xing of the symmetry and show that there are certain subtle issues
involved. eventually, using a theorem about laplace type operators, we
show in section 9 that the bps free energy is free from divergences due to
cancellations between the bosons and fermions. the quantum uctuations
of the wilson loop in the ads5  s5 background or its generalization to
the cases of dp with 16 supersymmetries are analyzed in section 10. we
argue that there is left over uncanceled lushcer term but we are unable to
determine neither its coecient nor its sign. sections 1113 are devoted to
a similar analysis in the setup corresponding to a conning behaviour. in
section 11 we show that the general case of this type behaves in a similar
manner to the pure gauge conguration, namely, that the wilson line is
well approximated by a straight string parallel to the horizon and close to
it. for this type of backgrounds, in spite of the fact that we do not have
a detailed green schwarz action we were able to show that the residual
interaction is of an attractive nature. the bosonic operators are considered
in section 12, while the fermionic ones are considered in section 13. we end
this paper with a summary of our results and a list of open questions.

2 the classical setup

let us rst, before introducing quantum uctuations, summarize the results
derived from classical string theory. having in mind space-time backgrounds
associated with the gravity/gauge dualities and mqcd, we restrict ourselves
to diagonal background metrics with components that depend only on one
coordinate. the metric g for the coordinates {t, x, yi, u, i} where i =
1, ..., p  1 and i = p + 2, ..., 9 is given by

g =   diagonal{gtt(u), gxx(u), gyiyi(u), guu(u), gi i (u)}

(1)

the classical (and, as we shall see, the one-loop) bosonic string has two
equivalent descriptions in terms of the nambugoto action and the polyakov
action. throughout this work we incorporate quantum uctuations mainly in
the former picture. comparison with the analysis in the polyakov formulation
is presented in section 7.

the nambugoto action of a string propagating in spacetime with a

general background metric takes the form

where

s =

1

2 z ddpdet h

(2)

4

h = x x g(x)

(3)

the classical string congurations associated with wilson loops are char-
acterized by boundary conditions which take the form of a loop on a boundary
plane. the plane is taken at some large but nite value u = us which later
is taken to innity. the form of the loop considered in the present work is
that of a very long strip along a spatial direction (l/2 < x < l/2) and a
temporal length t with l << t  . in certain models we will take the
temporal direction to be along another spatial direction.
since we assume invariance under time translation, we consider classical
static string solutions. these are spanned in the x, u plane by the function
u(x) and we set yi = 0, i = 0.

the ng action is invariant under world-sheet coordinate transformation.
it is convenient to use the static gauge in which we set the world-sheet time
to be identical to that of the target space,  = t. various dierent xings
of  will be discussed in the next section when quantum uctuations are
incorporated. for the classical conguration we take  = 2x. dening the
two functions

f 2(u)  gtt(u)gxx(u)
g2(u)  gtt(u)guu(u)

the action becomes

(4)

(5)

s = t z l dx = tz dxpf 2(u) + g2(u) (xu)2

using the fact that the lagrangian does not depend explicitly on x we
write the equation of motion in terms of the conserved generator of transla-
tions along x so that

xucl = 

f (ucl)

g(ucl)  pf 2(ucl)  f 2(u0)

f (u0)

(6)

where u0 is the minimal value of u reached by the string.

the classical prole of the wilson loop is a solution of (6) which satises
the boundary conditions stated above. since, in the language of the corre-
sponding gauge model, the quark and anti-quark are set at the coordinates
x = l/2, the relation between l and u0 is given by

l = 2z us

u0

g(u)
f (u)

du

f (u0)

pf 2(u)  f 2(u0)

5

(7)

f 2(u)

pf 2(u)  f 2(u0)

du

(8)

and the action is given by

s = 2t z us

u0

g(u)
f (u)

the basic conjecture of the string/gauge duality is that the natural can-
didate for the expectation value hwi of the wilson loop is proportional to
the partition function of the corresponding string action

hwi  z =z dx  exp (s)

(9)

where the integral is over all surfaces whose boundary is the given loop.
moreover, hwi is related to the quark anti-quark potential energy e(l) via
(10)

hwi  exp (t e(l))

so that in fact (8) determines the potential in the classical limit in which
the conguration of least action dominates. however, it is easy to see that
the expression (8) is linearly divergent as us   and hence has to be
renormalized. the mass of the quarks which translate in the string language
into a straight line between u = 0 (or u = uh in case there is an horizon
at uh [12]), is given by mq = r us
0 g(u)du. it is thus physically natural to
determine the quark anti-quark potential as e = s
t  2mq. for the special
case of the ads5s5 model this denition of the energy matches the legendre
transform of the action suggested in [30].
by implementing this expression for various dierent background metrics,
wilson loops corresponding to certain gauge systems were computed [17].
moreover, a theorem was stated in [17] determining the dependence of e as
a function of l for the general setup of (5).

3 quadratic uctuations and gauge xings in

the ng action

in order to account for the contributions to the wilson loop from quantum
uctuations we expand the coordinates around their classical values

x(,  ) = x

cl(,  ) + (,  )

(11)

that is,

{t = tcl + t ; x = xcl + x ; u = ucl + u ; yi = yi ; i = i}

(12)

6

the next step is to expand the nambugoto action up to terms quadratic
in the uctuations so that s = scl + s(2), and compute the following path
integral

z(2) =z dtdxduydyiydi exp(cid:8)s(2)(cid:9)

where we write

(13)

(14)

s(2) =xa z dd 

aoaa

with a the various elds. 2

the gaussian integration over the uctuations yields ( after gauge xing)

a product of determinants of second order dierential operators qa detoa

so that the corresponding free energy is given by

fb =  log z(2) = xa

2

log detoa

(15)

as was mentioned above, the ng action is invariant under worldsheet
reparameterizations, and in order to compute explicitly (13) one has to in-
troduce a gauge choice. in fact, without gauge xing the operators are de-
generate due to the reparameterization invariance [27]. obviously, the set of
operators oa depends on the gauge. in the following subsections we write
down the form of the operators in three dierent gauges. we set in all the
three gauges  = t so there are no uctuations in the time direction. the
gauges dier in the way we x  and the choice of the uctuating coordinates.
in the rst gauge we x the u coordinate and compute the uctuations of x,
yi and i while in the second one x is xed and u, yi and i uctuate. in the
third gauge the uctuations are taken to be along the normal coordinate to
ucl (in the ux plane) and along yi and i.

3.1 the xed u gauge
imposing the assignment  = u (running from u0 to ) one nds that to the
second order in the uctuations x and yi, the expression h = det h takes
the form

h(2) = g2(u) 1 +

gxx(u)
gtt(u)

2our treatment diers from that of [22] in that the authors of that article explicitly
 )1/2 corresponding to the classical

include in the integrals of (14) the measure (det h(0)
solution, and change the operators accordingly.

where xcl(u) is dened by ucl(xcl(u)) = u.

simplifying the last two terms (using (6)) and integrating by parts, we
nd that the set of operators oa includes two types of quadratic operators:

and similarly for oi with gi i (u) replacing gyiyi(u). the boundary condi-
tions we impose on the eigenfunctions are (u, 0) = (u, t ) = 0 , (, t) = 0
and (u0, t) = 0 or (u0, t) = 0 (the conditions at u0 imply that the function
 should be symmetric or antisymmetric around x = 0).

for a p + 1 dimensional space-time (t, x, yi), the bosonic free energy is

given by:

(19)

and similarly for oi where the boundary conditions are (l/2, t) = (l/2, t) =
0. the free energy is still given by (18).

3.2 the normal coordinate gauge

in this gauge we take the uctuations to be everywhere normal to the classical
curve (see gure 1). with this choice, both ucl and xcl are changed by the

8

uctuation to the nal values u and x. we further choose the gauge  = t (as
before), and  = ucl. the components of the tangent vector to the classical
curve obey tu/tx = xucl which is given by (6), and therefore the components
of the unit normal vector are the solutions of

nx(ucl) tx(ucl) gxx(ucl) + nu(ucl) tu(ucl) guu(ucl) = 0
nx(ucl)2 gxx(ucl) + nu(ucl)2 guu(ucl) = 1

(20)

the classical string

the fluctuation in

the normal gauge

the fluctuating string

figure 1: the uctuations in the normal gauge

we denote the magnitude of the uctuation along the normal direction
by the dimensionless eld n(ucl, t). the coordinate vector in the (x, u) plane
is thus

x = xcl(ucl) + nx(ucl) n(ucl, t) , u = ucl + nu(ucl) n(ucl, t)

(21)

and both ucl and xcl change after the uctuation to the nal values u and x.
unlike the xed u gauge, the uctuations result also in a change in the
in our gauge the o-diagonal elements are zero and the diagonal

metric.
elements, to second order, are given by:

g(x) = g(ucl) + ug(ucl)  nu(ucl) n(ucl, t)

ug(ucl)  (nu(ucl) n(ucl, t))2
2

(22)

(with no summation over indices). as the action is an integral of l essentially
from u =  to u = u0 and back again to u = , and we have the boundary
conditions n(, t) = 0, the part of l linear in n does not have to vanish, but
rather should be a total derivative of the form u(f(1) n(ucl, t)), in order to
ensure that the classical solution is an extremum. we nd this to be indeed
the case. inspection of h readily reveals that there are in h no quadratic
terms of the types tn  n or tn  un (and also no linear term of the type
tn). by adding a total derivative of the type u(f(2) n(ucl, t)2) we can also
get rid of the un  n term. finally, we get the quadratic expression

l(2) = lcl + c(ucl)2

n + ctt(ucl)(tn)2 + cuu(ucl)(un)2

thus the operator on takes the form

on = u(cuu(ucl)u)  ctt(ucl)2

t + c(ucl)

(23)

(24)

since the explicit expressions of the cs are cumbersome for the general case
we do not nd it useful to write them down. in sections 6, 12 we derive them
for certain special cases.

3.3 the xed x gauge

here we impose  = x and x the gauge by x = 0. expanding now the square
root of h to quadratic order yields yet another operator for the longitudinal
uctuations. we write it this time in the form of the action.

s(2) =

f (u0)

( u)2 + 2()2

u(cid:21)

gyiyi(u)gxx(u)

f (u0)2

( i)2(cid:21)(cid:27)

(25)

the mass term 2() will be written explicitly for specic metrics. the
fact that there is a mass term present in this gauge, and in the normal
coordinate gauge, and there is no such term in the xed u gauge is not
surprising since such a term necessarily arises when g(u) is expanded about
ucl. in the gauge  = u there is no uctuation in u so no such term arises.
the signicance of this term will be discussed further when we study special
cases such as ads and pure yang-mills.

3.4 comparing the dierent gauges

one expects that physical, gauge invariant quantities should be identical
when using dierent gauges. this general belief is justied provided that

10

one considers legitimate gauges. the dierential operators derived in the
three dierent gauges are manifestly not identical. it may happen that their
determinant is nevertheless identical. formally, one can pass from one gauge
to another. for instance changing the integration variable from  = x to
 = u together with the rescaling of u

u = x  xu(x)

(26)

maps between the xed x gauge to the xed u one. however, this rescaling
itself may be singular as indeed occurs at u0.

the computation of the operator ox in the xed u gauge corresponds
to the assumption that the longitudinal uctuation of the string is in the
x direction (gauge xing the coordinates u, t as ,  respectively). this
assumption leads to two problems in the physical interpretation. first, near
u = u0, even a small uctuation can lead to multiple valuedness of x as
a function of u. second, the extremal point can itself uctuate in the u
direction, and no longer correspond to u = u0 (see gure 2). the problem
is that at u = u0 the x direction is tangential to the classical curve, and
that choice of the direction of the eld of uctuations becomes singular. as
the metrics depend only on u, this choice of uctuation involves no change
in metric. it is easy to understand, therefore, why the operator ox involves
only derivatives of the uctuating eld.
by choosing  to be x, and the direction of uctuations to be along u,
the limit u =  becomes singular in the aforementioned sense. however,
this singularity exists also in the uctuations of the bare quarks, and after
the subtraction of the quark masses from (8) it might cancel.

the safest choice, however, seems to be taking the uctuations to be

anywhere normal to the classical curve, as previously explained. 3

3in [22] the computations were performed in the riemann normal coordinate ap-

proach. this method is similar to the normal coordinate we are using.

11

4 bosonic string in at space-time

we can now easily derive the free energy of a bosonic string in at space-time
(luscher term). the metric is given by gtt = 1 ; gxx = gyiyi = 1, where
i = 1, . . . , d  2. note that u is now one of the yi coordinates. the classical
solution in this case is just a straight line along the x direction from l/2
to l/2. obviously, for this case the three dierent gauges are identical. we
use (19) and regard only the transverse uctuations operator ( oyi). this
operator is the ordinary minkowski laplacian. considering now euclidean
space time and demanding the eigenfunctions to vanish on the boundary, the
eigenvalues of the laplacian are (minus)

5 a general scaling result

the argument of the previous section can be generalized to operators which
do not necessarily correspond to the at case and will lead to a general scaling
result that will prove useful in our work.

12

let us dene the operators

o[a, b] = a2ft(v)2

t + b2ov

(32)

with t the time, v a coordinate whose range is independent of l. ov is a
general operator of v alone, independent of l, and a, b are constants which
may depend on l. then, v [a, b], dened as the correction to the potential
arising from o[a, b], is proportional to b/a. in particular, the potential is
independent of any overall factor multiplying the operator o.
the idea of the proof is that by redening t we can scale the operator
o[a, b] to o[1, 1], and the factors by which the eigenvalues get multiplied
in this operation become irrelevant in the large t limit. we proceed to the
proof itself.

separation of variables shows that the eigenfunctions of o[a, b] are (v, t) =

eit(v). we dene the eigenvalues en() by

and en() by

or

so that

(cid:2)ft(v) 2 + ov(cid:3) (v) = en() (v)
(cid:2)a2ft(v) 2 + b2ov(cid:3) (v) = en() (v)
(cid:2)ft(v)(a/b)2 + ov)(cid:3) (v) = b2en() (v)

en() = b2 en(a/b)

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

the boundary conditions for the time coordinate lead to  = m
t

for
integer m. hence we have for v [a, b], (when o(t ) designates a term which
does not depend on t , or grows sublinearly with it),

 t  v [a, b] + o(t ) =

(38)

where y is a transverse coordinate of the ads5, while  is a transverse coor-
dinate in s5. we therefore get

f (u) =

note that as we deal with small uctuations and big r, the angular coordi-
nates  of s5 can be treated as if they were not compactied.

unlike the at case, for the ads5  s5 metric the dierent gauge xings
in the xed u gauge one nds using (19) the following quadratic operators

v  /l+c/l with   g2

in the dimensionless variable v = u/u0, it is easy to see that this operator
is of the form (32), with a2 = r4u2
0 , b2 = 1. we conclude, according to
the result of section 5, that the correction to the potential is proportional
to r2u0, that is [8], inversely proportional to l. moreover, there is no
further dependence on r when we eliminate the variable u0 in favour of l.
the classical and quadratic quantum quark antiquark potential add up to
y m n  r4 the t hooft coupling constant, and
c a universal constant, independent of . we see that the quantum expansion
in  is equivalent, for large , to an expansion in r2 or equivalently in 1/2.
the quantum expansion does not spoil, of course, the conformal nature of
the eld theory. the other operators for the normal gauge can be seen,
by similar reasoning, to give rise also to a potential correction of the same
characteristics.

note also that if we approximate the classical curve to be at over most
of its range and thus approximate u = u0 throughout, the mass term drops
out and the operator simplies to the at laplacian,

and for the longitudinal direction we get exactly the same luscher term as in
the at case. the same happens also to the transverse directions. (note that
o
n cannot be approximated in this way since u is constant and it is thus not
integrated over ). the shape of the string, however, does not change with l
but only scales. it is thus not a good approximation, in our case, to assume
that the string is at. in section 11 we will give quite a stringent criterion
for atness, and prove that strings in metrics corresponding to conning eld
theories are indeed at.

when we revert to a dierential operator involving the coordinate x in-
stead of u, (with the integration of the lagrangian in the t, x coordinates),
the operator (43) is translated to

note that we can use the same scaling arguments as for the normal gauge
to show that the correction is inversely proportional to l. another remark is

15

in order. the mass term is more properly looked at as a shift in the levels
of the massless modes rather than as a real mass term, since it behaves like
0/r4 which is proportional to 1/l2. thus the mass gap in this case will be
u2
of the same order as the energy of a massless mode in a box of length l.

7 the bosonic string in the ads5  s5 back-

ground  polyakovs action

the analysis of the quadratic quantum uctuations can be performed, as was
discussed at the end of section 2, also in the framework of polyakovs action.
here we present a rederivation of the bosonic determinant of the ads5  s5
wilson loop using the polyakov action. recall that the action (2) is given by

s =

1

2z ddhhx x g(x)

(47)

with the metric given in (38). this action is minimized by the classical
conguration

u(,  ) = ucl();

t(,  ) =  ; x(, ) = ; yi(,  ) = 0; i(,  ) = 0 (48)

the function ucl() satises the equation [8]

y2py4  1
where u0 = u( = 0), the minimal value of ucl, is determined by the boundary
conditions at  = l/2 where u  , to be

the classical value of the worldsheet metric is determined by the equations
of motion derived by variation of the action with respect to h,

which take the following form

the quantum uctuations of the string coordinates are introduced as in (12),
and those of the world sheet metric are as follows

h = (h)cl(1 + );

h  = (h  )cl(1 +  );

where , ,  parameterize the metric uctuations.

h = p(h)cl(h  )cl

(53)

we now use the reparameterization invariance of the action to choose the

gauge in which

so that

u(,  ) = t(,  ) = 0

(54)

u = ucl(); xt =  ; x1 =  + 1; x2 = 2; x3 = 3

(55)

note that we do not consider here the uctuations in the  directions.

next we expand the action (47) to quadratic order in the s and the s.
the rst order correction of the classical action s(1) is expected to vanish
and indeed

s(1) =

vanishes by the boundary conditions on 1. the quadratic term is given by:

our next step is to perform the gaussian integrals over the s. recall that
our goal is to compute

z(2) =z dh

di exp(cid:8)s(2)(cid:9)

(58)

where we integrate over the uctuations of h. this can be translated to
integrations of the various s. the result of the integral is:

z(2) =

gauge the bosonic operators derived from polyakovs action are identical to
those found from the ng action (42).

8 introducing fermionic uctuations

so far we have considered only quantum uctuations of the bosonic degrees
of freedom. recall, however, that gauge/gravity duality was originally [7]
proposed in the context of superstring theories which include worldsheet
fermions. this, together with the hope that supersymmetry will lead to
the cancellation of divergences, raises the question of the contribution of
fermionic uctuations to the free energy. it might seem an easy task to trun-
cate the nsr action and collect terms quadratic in the fermionic uctua-
tions. this is indeed the case for a at background with vanishing ramond
ramond form. however there is so far no satisfactory formulation of the
world-sheet supersymmetric nsr action for a background with non-vanishing
rr forms. recall that in the ads5  s5 model, the self dual 5-form plays
an essential role. hence we use here the manifestly space-time supersym-
metric gs approach. for the ads5  s5 background this action has been
constructed in [24] as a supersymmetric sigma model with the coset super-
manifold so(2, 2|4)/(so(1, 4)  so(5)) as its target space. the gs action
is invariant under local -symmetry. by gauge xing this symmetry one re-
duces the number of fermionic degrees of freedom by a factor of two so that it
matches the number of bosonic degrees of freedom. in [27] a 2d scalar-scalar
duality transformation was invoked to transform the gauge xed action into
an action which is quadratic in the fermions.

in this section we rst consider the fermionic contribution of the super-
symmetric theory in at space-time. we then use the gauge xed action
[27] to deduce the contribution of the fermionic quantum correction in the
ads5  s5 background.

8.1 fermions in at space-time

for at minkowski space-time we choose the super-poincare group as our
target space. when we explicitly consider a at classical string, the fermionic
part of the simplied gauge xed gs-action in the at space-time is simply

18

sf lat

f = 2iz dd ii

where  is a weyl-majorana spinor and i are the so(1,9) gamma matrices.
the fermionic operator is, hence

(61)

(62)

and squaring it we get  = 2
t . the total free energy of the supersym-
metric case is therefore (using the fact that for d=10, we have 8 transverse
coordinates and 8 components of a weyl-majorana spinor),

of = df = ii
x  2

and there is no lushcer term.

f = 8 (cid:18)

log det  + log det df(cid:19) = 0

(63)

8.2 fermions in ads5  s5
the target space for the gs action in the ads5  s5 background is the
coset superspace su(2, 2|4)/(so(1, 4)  so(5)) [24]. the action is found
to be in the form of the usual supersymmetric string action (but with the
induced nonat metric), with a change of the derivative acting on the spinor
variables 1, 2. if ea

worldsheet spin connection, then

i is the induced worldsheet vielbien, and ab

with di = i + 1
i ab the usual induced worldsheet covariant derivative.
the interpretation is that the metric inuences the action through di while
the ramondramond ux is responsible for the second term in (64). using
the gauge xing suggested in [25, 26, 27], the fermionic part of the action for
the classical solution can be computed and it leads to the operator

we nd therefore, that the transverse uctuations partially cancel the fermionic
uctuations and we are left with six fermionic degrees of freedom and the
longitudinal and angular bosonic uctuations.

9 bare quark in ads5  s5
in this section we investigate the single bare quark, which is a at string
in ads5  s5 space stretching along the ads radial coordinate .
in this
case the string is a bps state and we expect neither its charge nor its mass
to be modied by quantum uctuations. this problem is related to issues
associated with certain bps soliton solutions [31].

the ads5  s5 metric is

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn =(cid:18) r2

u2(cid:19) du2 +(cid:18) u2

r2(cid:19) dxdx + r2d2

5

(67)

where we take {x0, x1, x2, x3} with minkowskian signature.
the classical solution of the bare quark is  = u,  = t, xi = 0 and the s5
angles i=0. it is obvious that there is a separation of the quadratic action,
and the uctuations of the elds can be taken one at a time. we shall take
the static gauge of the action, so that the uctuating elds are the three xi
and the ve i.

for the ve angular elds, since we are working in the large r regime,
the curvature of s5 is not felt, and we can approximate s5 locally by the
at space r5. we take one eld (,  ) along one angle , i.e, study the
worldsheet with (u, t, ) = (, , (,  )). we have

h = gm n xm xn =(cid:18) (u/r)2 + r2 2

r2 

r2 

(r/u)2 + r22 (cid:19)

(68)

so that

h = det h = 1 + (r4/u2) 2  u22

(69)

t + (u/r)22

the quadratic action

the nambugoto action (2) is therefore s  h = 1 + s(2) + o(4) with
s(2)  (r/u)2 2  (u/r)22 = (cid:2)(r/u)22
u  1/r2(cid:3)  (70)
where we have used integration by parts and the dirichlet boundary condi-
tions. we therefore see that for the ve angular bosonic uctuations, the
quadratic operator is o = (r/u)22
for the three spatial coordinates, we want to keep the uctuating eld
dimensionless, so we take (u, t, x) = (, , (,  )/u). a similar calculation
yields in this case the operator o = (r/u)22
regarding the fermionic uctuations around the classical bare quark con-
guration, one can see that the -symmetry xing suggested at [25, 27] is
not applicable, and produces a degenerate operator. we should therefore

one should note, however, that taking another gauge xing, which is a-
priori as good as ours (e.g. 1 = i30) leads to a dierent result. we prefer
our gauge xing as it leads to the expected cancelation of the divergences.
all the quadratic operators of the dynamical degrees of freedom are seen
to be of the form oj = (r/u)22
u  cj/r2. there are eight
bosonic ones, corresponding to the eight coordinates left after xing the
worldsheet reparameterizations, and eight fermionic ones. the fermionic
operators were squared, and are taken with a negative sign, as the elds are
complex grassmannian. therefore, the quadratic quantum contribution to
the mass is

m =

(74)

we were unable to nd explicitly the eigenvalues of those operators and
multiply them using some regularization scheme. however, it is well known
that the logarithm of the determinant of such second order operators has
in general quadratic, linear and logarithmic divergences in the cuto scale
. moreover, the corresponding coecients are known (see, for example,
[5]). the sheer fact that the number of fermionic and bosonic operators is
the same, and that they dier only in the mass term cj/r2 is sucient

21

to ensure that the quadratic and linear divergences cancel out in (74). the
logarithmic divergence also cancels out provided that

xbosons

cj = 0

(75)

indeed, we have 3  3 + 5  1  8  7/4 = 0. we therefore see that there is no
innite part, needing renormalization, to the aforementioned contribution to
the bare quark mass. we were unable to show, however, that the nite part
also vanishes, as expected from supersymmetry.

10 fluctuations of the dp backgrounds

in this section we show that the quadratic contribution of the quantum uc-
tuations to the potential is proportional to 1/l in the general dp background
(p  4). in the d3 case, where the result is dictated by conformality, this
was shown in section 6.

for metrics relevant to dp-branes, gtt = gxx = gyy and

with arbitrary a, b 6= 0 , k, j (for those specic metrics, a  r(7p)/2). the
power-like behaviour of f, g is essential in order to get the desired result.
the operator for transverse uctuations is given by (17). inserting f, g to
that equation and changing the variable u to v = u/u0 (which has the range
1  v <  regardless of l), we get

b ukj1
by the result of section 5, the potential is proportional to b/a = a
.
as it is known [17] that l  b
, we nally get that v  l1, that is,
the correction to the potential resulting from transversal bosonic uctuations
(and from all fermionic ones) is inversely proportional to l. unfortunately,
we do not know the constant of proportionality, and not even its sign. this
constant of proportionality, however, cannot depend on r since the constants
a, b cancel out. indeed, for p 6= 3, the t hooft coupling constant   r7p
is dimensionful, and therefore can not enter the aforementioned constant of
proportionality. the classical and quantum quadratic potentials add up to
v  1/(5p)/l2/(5p) + c/l and the quantum expansion is in 1/(5p).

one can easily see that the scaling for the longitudinal bosonic operator
ox in the xed u gauge is essentially identical, as it can be casted to the form
(32) with the same a, b as in the transverse case. therefore we conclude
that the correction arising from this gauge xing also obeys v  l1. the
picture in the normal gauge, which we argued is safer, is more involved. we
have computed it explicitly and shown the l1 behaviour only in the p = 3
case.

11 flatness of the string in the conning case

the string in the conning pure yang-mills case was shown [19] to be
very at for large l. this result will be needed for the next section.
in
this section we shall generalize this result in a precise manner for all metrics
giving connement. we shall pick a constant value w (independent of l)
and inquire at what distance d from the ends of the string (at x = l/2)
the string reaches u = w. we shall nd that we cannot show that d is
independent of l but rather we nd that it can grow with l. this growth is
however mild and the ratio d/l tends to zero as l grows (see gure 3).

the analysis requires the taylor expansion of f (u) and g(u) (we use the

conventions of [17]),

f (u) = f (0) + akuk + o(uk+1)
g(u) = bjuj + o(uj+1)

(79)
(80)

with f (0) 6= 0 due to connement. we pick w to be suciently small so that
all our subsequent approximations are valid.

for small u, substitution of (79),(80) in (6) gives

u  xu  p2f (0)ak(uk  uk

the critical case k = 2(j + 1) is the generic one (k = 2, j = 0) and also

in the non critical case k > 2(j + 1), the minimum of f (u) is more at,

12 bosonic uctuations in the pure yang-

mills setup

when one of the spatial coordinates of the ads5s5 metric is compactied on
a circle of radius  u1
t , with the proper boundary condition [13], the modes
in the compact dimension become kaluza-klein modes with masses of the
order of ut , and the fermions and scalars of the conformal four-dimensional
theory also acquire masses of the same order and decouple in the low energy
regime of the theory. therefore, the n = 4 conformal theory in four dimen-
sions is deformed to a theory similar to non supersymmetric yang-mills in
three dimensions.

in the brane language, the metric corresponds to non extremal d3 branes
in the near horizon limit, and ut is related to the energy density on the d3
brane.

let us call the compact direction z. with the conventions introduced
earlier, working euclideanly, and still neglecting factors of 2, the metric is

a calculation for the longitudinal part using normal uctuations, similar to
that performed for the conformal case in section 6, can be carried out, and
the result turns out to be similar to the longitudinal result in that case, only
with a dierent mass term.

in the large l limit, as we have seen in section 11, the string is, for most
of its length, very at, and has u  u0. following [19], we assume that we
can trust this analysis even after substituting u  u0 in the operators. in

we see that the operators for transverse uctuations, oy, o, oz, turn
out to be simply the laplacian in at spacetime, multiplied by overall factors,
which are, as we have seen, irrelevant. therefore, the transverse uctuations
yield the standard luscher term [1] proportional to 1/l.

26

l e2l to the potential.

the longitudinal normal uctuations give rise to an operator ox corre-
sponding to a 1 + 1 dimensional scalar eld with mass 2ut /r2 = . such a
eld contributes a yukawalike term  p 

we see that the under the assumption that we can approximate the classi-
cal string conguration by a at one, we get that one of the bosonic degrees of
freedom becomes massive and its 1/l contribution to the potential is reduced
to an exponentially small contribution (similar to, but even weaker than, the
exponential part of the classical correction (91)). this is in contrast to the
results of [19], where two bosonic degrees of freedom become massive. the
source of this discrepancy is that in [19], the string is approximated to lie on
the horizon, u  ut . our scheme, in which the approximation is u  u0, is
more accurate.
in the calculations of [19], one must take into account the force exerted on
the (almost) at string by the non at segments near x = l/2. the addition
of the corresponding potential causes the at string to be in equilibrium at
u = u0. therefore, (in the notations of [19]), we get z 2 + t 2 = u0  ut 6=
0, and there is a spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry. the
resulting goldstone boson is exactly the degree of freedom which is massless
in our calculation but massive in that of [19].

which appears also in the killing spinor equation of type iib supergravity.
here,  is the dilaton and f15 is the ramondramond eld strength. in
the ads5  s5 case, there is no dilaton background ( = 0), and f15 
u315. in the actual computation, a factor of ( det g)1/2  u3 can-
cels the u3 from f , and the last term of (104) indeed reduces to the last term
of (64), with the minkowskispace 01234 replaced by ij .

when moving to the pure yangmills metric (87), upon compactica-
tion of the coordinate z, the dilaton and ramondramond ux remain the
same, and det g does not change either. assuming the same form (104) of
the derivative, we therefore again arrive at (64).

based on the results of section 11, we now assume, as in the bosonic
computation of the previous section, that the classical string is at. that is,
0 = t, 1 = x1, with u = u0 and all other coordinates zero (or constant).

27

the combined uctuations of the string around its classical solution and of
the fermions around zero give terms of high order; the quadratic terms of the
fermions are coupled only to the bosonic classical solution.

it is straightforward to see that the induced vielbein ea

with di the covariant derivative containing the eects of gravity and of the

by the previous discussion, the term arising from the ramondramond ux
in di is ciij . in order to agree with (64), c = u0/2r2. in conclusion,

inserting (107),(108) into (105) we get 24 terms which reduce to

d0i = (cid:2)(0 + 04)ij + c0ij(cid:3) j
d1i = (cid:2)(1 + 14)ij + c1ij(cid:3) j

i41, as advocated by [27] for the ads5  s5 case, we get

now we should impose a symmetry gauge. choosing the gauge 2 =

l  1(cid:2)00 + 11 + 2i(c  i)014(cid:3) 1  1of 1

when we square the fermionic operator, and remove, using integration by
parts, the terms with a single derivative, we nally get

(110)

f = 2
o2

0 + 2

1 + 4(c  i)2

(111)

we thus see that all the eight fermionic modes become massive, with mass
m = 2(c  i). the mass of the fermions has an imaginary part, but as by

28

(106),  is vanishingly small for large distances l, we see that m  2c =
ut /r2 is half the mass of the only massive bosonic mode.
choosing the similar symmetry gauge 2 = i31 we get a similar
(112)

result,

l  1(cid:2)00 + 11 + 24 + 2ic013(cid:3) 1

now

and we have m2 = 4(c2 + 2)  4c2, so again m  2c in the large l limit.
in conclusion, we see that in the pure ym case there are seven massless
bosonic modes, and no fermionic ones. the contribution of the luscher term
to the quark antiquark potential is (7 0) /24 1/l, which is attractive
and concave in agreement with the general result in quantum eld theory
[20, 21].

14 summary and discussion

wilson loops are some of the most important gauge invariant physical quan-
tities associated with non-abelian gauge theories. they play an essential
role in the understanding of the underlying structure of ym theory. in par-
ticular, the rectangular loop has a simple interpretation, being related to the
static potential between a quark and an anti-quark. wilson loops have thus
attracted a tremendous amount of work throughout the years. among the
various approaches invoked to investigate the wilson loop, the description
in terms of a string model is the most promising. this approach is based
on the fact that stringy wilson loops obey the loop equation, and on the
phenomenological picture of a ux tube connecting the quark pair. recently
the duality conjecture of maldacena [7] has given this approach new impetus
from a new perspective.

it is easy to realize that a classical string in at spacetime results in
an area law behaviour which is expected for a gauge theory in the conning
phase. an interesting issue that had been discussed in the early eighties is
the quantum corrections to the linear potential. the purpose of the present
work is to shed additional light on this issue, using the gravity description
of large n gauge theories. en route to this goal we have also addressed the
issues of the quantum correction to the quark antiquark potential in n = 4
sym via quadratic uctuations of the corresponding string in the ads5  s5
background, as well as the contribution of these uctuations to the mass of
the bps quark in that approach.

29

determining the quantum corrections involves four steps:

(i) writing
down the corresponding action, (ii) choosing an appropriate gauge xing,
(iii) expanding the gauge xed action to quadratic order and (iv) comput-
ing, using some regularization scheme, the functional determinant and the
resulting free energy. whereas the bosonic part of the action is well known
for any background, the incorporation of fermionic degrees of freedom is more
involved, due to the presence of a non trivial ramondramond background
in the models we discuss. so far no complete nsr action for such systems
has been formulated. a greenschwarz type of action was formulated for
the ads5  s5 model [24], but not for the more general backgrounds that
in attempt to generalize the fermionic
correspond to conning scenarios.
action we used the fact that the ads5  s5 action is a covariantization of the
at gs action, and, assuming the same behaviour, wrote down the fermionic
operators for the conning scenario.

it turned out that the issue of choosing a gauge slice is more tricky.
already in xing the 2d reparameterization we found that dierent gauge
choices lead to dierent operators.
in principle, dierent operators could
yield the same regularized determinant. moreover, since we were not able
to compute explicitly the determinants, we cannot really claim that they are
indeed dierent. however even the argument that the xed u gauge, the xed
x gauge and the normal gauge lead to the same free energy was plagued
with possible singularities. we also argued that the latter gauge is safer than
the others. the projection of the fermionic elds into 8 grassmannian degrees
of freedom (a single weyl-majorana spinor) through xing of the symmetry
can also be performed in various ways, and again, dierent gauge slices yield
dierent operators. for the bps single quark conguration of the ads5 s5,
the 4 gauge xing, introduced in [27], was found to be inapplicable (as in
general, xing the -symmetry using a i projection cannot be used when the
classical conguration spans along xi) and of the other projections we tried
one lead to a cancelation of the logarithmic divergences while another did
not. further investigation is required in order to gain better understanding
of the issue of choosing a legitimate and eective -symmetry gauge xing.
as for step (iv), we were not able to compute explicitly the determinants,
apart from the known case of at space-time. regarding the conning setup,
we used similar considerations to those of [19] in treating the bosonic degrees
of freedom and found that (only) one mode becomes massive. we were also
able to nd some evidence that the fermionic modes are massive as well, thus
leading to a quantum correction to the linear potential which is attractive
and of luscher type. this provides an evidence in favour of the gauge/gravity
duality, as it was shown in [20], based on general arguments, that the overall
quantum potential should be concave.

30

the ultimate test of the results concerning the conning setups is compar-
ison with experimental observations. there were several attempts to deduce
the corrections to the linear potential from the spectrum of heavy mesons
but it is not clear to us whether one can reach a coherent picture from this
analysis. on the way to comparing with experiment one should also consider
lattice computations of wilson loops in 3 and 4 dimensional pure ym theory.
in particular, one should address the question whether a luscher term cor-
rection to the linear potential can be seen in lattice simulations. according to
[28] there are some numerical evidence for a luscher term associated with a
bosonic string. however the results are not precise enough to be convincing.
it is the quantum uctuations of the ads5  s5 case that leave us with
several unresolved puzzles. in [22] it was found that there is a logarithmic
divergence in the determinant and it was suggested that the innity should
be canceled by renormalizing the mass of the bare quarks. however, the
latter are bps states and thus should not receive any quantum corrections.
indeed, we have shown that, at least in a certain -symmetry gauge xing
there are no logarithmic divergences. on the other hand we could not nd
any gauge xing in which the quantum corrections to the wilson loop are
free of logarithmic divergences. hence, the renormalization and gauge xing
procedures for this case deserve further investigation. as for the question
of whether the ads5  s5 case admits a luscher term and of what sign, we
again do not have a conclusive answer. there are no hints from the explicit
calculation that the bosonic and fermionic determinants cancel. as discussed
in the introduction, the coecient of the luscher term is in fact related to
the intercept, the normal ordering constant in the virasoro l0 generator.
we do not have any evidence that this should vanish in the ads case.

there is, however, a naive argument why the luscher term should not
exist. in the limit of r   one may speculate that locally one sees a at
metric and hence there should be a vanishing coecient. now, since the
basic property of the luscher term is that it is independent on r, the result
for r   should hold for any r. as we couldnt verify this prediction
we may suspect that the argument is too naive and one cannot extrapolate
smoothly to the wilson loop in at space time.
it is thus clear that the
explicit evaluation of the various determinants in the ads5  s5 case is still
an open and challenging question.
