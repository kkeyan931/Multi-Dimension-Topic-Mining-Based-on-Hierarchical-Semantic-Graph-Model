abstract

by dimensional reduction of a massive bf theory, a new topological eld
theory is constructed in (2+1) dimensions. two dierent topological terms,
one involving a scalar and a kalb-ramond elds and another one equivalent
to the four-dimensional bf term, are present. we constructed two actions
with these topological terms and show that a topological mass generation
mechanism can be implemented. using the non-chern-simons topological
term, an action is proposed leading to a classical duality relation between
klein-gordon and maxwell actions. we also have shown that an action in
(2+1) dimensions with the kalb-ramond eld is related by buschers duality
transformation to a massive gauge-invariant stuckelberg-type theory.

i. introduction

it is well known that a topological chern-simons term give rise to gauge invariant mass to
the gauge eld [1]. in (3+1) dimensions, two procedures are generally used for generating
massive gauge elds consistent with gauge-invariance. one is the stuckelberg formulation
[2] which is the more familiar higgs mechanism in its simplest form and the other one uses a
2-form potential (kalb-ramond eld) b coupled to the one-form gauge potential a through
a b  f term, where f = da is the eld-strength of a [35].

this theory has two types of gauge-invariance and has therefore highly constrained cou-
plings and is very geometrical. in a rst order formulation of the non-abelian yang-mills
gauge theory ( bf-ym model) [6] a b  f term has been used to contribute for a discussion
of quark connement in continuum qcd. additionally, transmutation of statistics of point
particles in (2+1) dimensions can be generalized to that of strings in (3+1) dimensions via a
b  f term [7]. on the other hand, the so-called mixed chern-simons term, which involves
two one-form gauge elds, was recently studied in connection with certain condensed matter
systems [8], namely josephson junction arrays [9].

in this letter, we consider a new topological term in (2+1) dimensions, obtained by
dimensional reduction from a b  f (3+1) dimensional abelian model (to the best of our
knowledge, this term has not been studied in the explicit form presented here). this term
has the form b  d and involves b and a 0-form eld . we show that this term can
generate mass for the kalb-ramond eld as well as for the scalar eld. an action with
this non-chern-simons topological term, leads us to a classical duality between the free
klein-gordon and maxwell actions. on the other hand, using the stuckelberg formulation,
an alternative massive gauge-invariant model is constructed. finally, motivated by the
fact that a interchange between topological and noether current usually denotes a duality
transformation, we also shown that a topological action in 2+1 dimensions with the kalb-
ramond eld is related by buschers duality transformation [10] to a stukelberg-type theory.

ii. non-chern-simons topological term

our starting point is the abelian b  f four-dimensional action [11,12]

sbf = zm4 (cid:8)b  f  g2b  b(cid:9) .

(1)

this action is formulated in terms of the two-form potential b while f = da is the eld-
strength of a one-form gauge potential a and  is the hodge star (duality) operator. the
quadratic term is included for latter convenience.

dimensional reduction is usually done by expanding the elds in normal modes corre-
sponding to the compactied extra dimensions, and integrating out the extra dimensions.
this approach is very useful in dual models and superstrings [13]. here, however, we only
consider the elds in higher dimensions to be independent of the extra dimensions.

in this case, we assume that our elds are independent of the extra coordinate x3. from

(1), on performing dimensional reduction as described above, we get in three dimensions

s = zm3 (cid:8)b  d + v  f  g2b  b + g2v  v(cid:9) ,

(2)

2

where v and  are a 1-form and a 0-form elds respectively.

we recognize that b  d is topological in the sense that there is no explicit dependence
on the space-time metric. one has to stress that this term may not be confused with the
two-dimensional version of the b  f , which involves a scalar and a one-form elds [14].
moreover, a term that is equivalent to the four-dimensional b  f term is present in action
(2) (the so-called mixed chern-simons term, v f ). on the other hand, this action displays
a local tensor gauge symmetry whose origin is to be connected to the topological character
of model and present still an invariance under u(1)  u(1).

iii. topological mass generation

now, in order to show the topological mass generation for the vector and tensor elds, we
construct two variations from the model (2), by introducing their propagation terms.

the model with propagation for the two-form gauge potential b and with the topological

term b  d may be represented through the action

s = zm3 (cid:26)1

2

h  h +

1
2

d  d + b  d(cid:27) ,

(3)

where the second term is a klein-gordon term,  is a mass parameter and h = db is a
three-form eld-strength of b.

we follow here the same steps that has been used by allen et al. [5] in order to show the
topological mass generation in the context of b  f model. thus, we nd the equations of
motion for scalar and tensor elds, which are respectively

and

d h = d

d d = h.

(4)

(5)

applying d  on both sides of eq. (5) and using the eq. (4), we obtain the equation of

motion for , namely

(dd + 2)d = 0.

(6)

repeating the procedure above in reverse order, we obtain the equation of motion for h

(dd + 2)h = 0.

(7)

these equations can be rewritten as

3

and

((cid:3) + 2) = 0

((cid:3) + 2)h = 0.

(8)

(9)

therefore, the uctuations of  and h are massive. obviously, these two possibilities can
not occurs simultaneously. indeed, in the most interesting case, the degree of freedom of
the massless  eld is eaten up by the gauge eld b to become massive and the  eld
completely decouples from the theory.

on the other hand, the model with propagation for two one-form gauge elds is repre-

sented by the action

s = zm3 (cid:26)1

2

f  f + v  f +

1
2

g  g(cid:27) ,

where the rst term is the maxwell one, and

g = dv.

(10)

(11)

in the equation (10) we highlight the topological term that involves two vector elds. the
equations of motion for them are

and

df =  dv

dg =  f.

following the former procedure we get

and

((cid:3) + 2)f = 0,

((cid:3) + 2)g = 0,

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

which shows that the uctuations of f and g are massive. this last case has already been
discussed by ghosh et al. [15].

4

iv. a classical duality

let us take a look in the following action

zm3 (cid:20)b  d 

1
2

b  b(cid:21)

(16)

we would like to mention the analogy of this action with the so called bf-yang-mills
model [6]. the latter formulation take advantage of the two-form gauge eld b to use a rst
order formalism to study pure yang-mills theory in four dimensions. furthermore, the bf-
ym model (using stuckelberg auxiliary elds) preserves all the symmetries of the topological
b  f model, and so, yang-mills theory can be viewed as a perturbative expansion around
the pure topological theory [12]. in the present case, the kalb-ramond eld can be also
seen as an auxiliary eld, leading us to a free maxwell action. as a matter of fact, the
non-abelian version of (16) may be interesting if we want to treat 3d yang-mills theory in
a rst order formalism.

on the other hand, we can consider the action (16) as a master equation for klein-gordon
and maxwell action in (2+1) dimensions. indeed, is easy to see that variation with respect
to  implies that

and, from the poincares lemma

putting this result in (16), we have

db = 0

b = da.

sm = 

1

2 zm3

f  f,

(17)

which is the maxwell action. performing now the variation with respect to b, we can write
down

substituting in (16) gives

b = d.

s =

1

2 zm3

d  d.

(18)

so, from the master action (16) we have shown that sm and s are dual to each other
[16]. this duality, specially if considered in the framework of non-abelian extensions, can
aids greatly in unraveling interesting features of the models with non-trivial topology. in
particular, may be interesting the study toward connection with new gauge formulations of
three-dimensional gravity [18]. further discussions about the consequences of extensions of
(16) will be presented in ref. [17].

v. st uckelberg-type mass generation

we would like now to introduce a dierent type of mass generation. the stuckelberg for-
mulation [2] enforces a gauge invariance by means of an auxiliary eld. the starting point
here is the gauge invariant action:

s = zm3 (cid:26)1

2

h  h  m2(b  d)  ( b  d)(cid:27) .

this action has invariance under

and

b  b + d

   + ,

(19)

(20)

(21)

where  is the stuckelberg one-form auxiliary eld and  its respective transformation

parameter. the equations of motion following from this action for b and  are

and

d h  m2 ( b  d) = 0

d ( b  d) = 0.

(22)

(23)

so the current k = m2 ( b  d) associated with b eld is conserved due to equation of
motion of the  eld, such as that for noether current.

let us now compare two dierent formulation of spin-one massive theory, namely the
actions (19) and (3). the equation of motion from the latter action for kalb-ramond eld
is

d h =  d = jb.

(24)

therefore the current jb is an algebraically conserved current, since ( d )( d) = 0 (equiv-
alently, j = 0).

this interchange between topological and noether current in two dierent formulations
of massive spin-one gauge theory usually denotes a duality transformation. as we shall see
now, indeed that is the case.

consider a global symmetry in (3) of the form  =  and b = 0. the dual theory
is obtained by the procedure of gauging the global symmetry in the model by a one-form
gauge eld a and constraining it to be zero by means of a closed 2-form lagrange multiplier

6

. thus this gauge eld is integrated and the theory is expressed in terms of the multiplier
eld. this is the well-known buschers duality procedure [10].

having the above procedure in mind the action (3) may be rewritten as

s = zm3 (cid:26)1

2

h  h +

1
2

(d  a)  (d  a) + b  (d  a) +   a(cid:27) ,

(25)

where the 2-form eld  is dened as  = d.

deriving the action (25) respect to a, one gets

(d  a) = (b  ),

(26)

and integrating out the eld a we reobtain the stuckelberg action (19).

similar results has been discussed by harikumar and sivakumar in the context of four-

dimensional b  f model [19].

vi. conclusions

in summary,
it was shown that a topologically massive theory can arise from three-
dimensional models containing a 2-form (kalb-ramond) and a 0-form elds. such models
are obtained from dimensional reduction of a b  f four-dimensional theory. our main
analysis has focused on the role played by the non-chern-simons topological term, namely,
that involving a 2-form and a 0-form elds. we showed that this term can generate mass to
the kalb-ramond eld. further, this term favors a classical duality equivalence between a
massless scalar eld theory and a maxwell action.

finally, we have shown that a 3d topologically massive theory describing spin-one par-
ticle, with a topological term dierent from the usual b  f term, is dually equivalent to a
stuckelberg-type spin-one theory.
