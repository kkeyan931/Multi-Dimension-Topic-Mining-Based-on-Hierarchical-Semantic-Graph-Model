abstract

we apply a boost-invariant similarity renormalization group procedure to a light-front
hamiltonian of a scalar eld  of bare mass  and interaction term  g3 in 6 dimensions using
3rd order perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling constant g. the initial hamilto-
nian is regulated using momentum dependent factors that approach 1 when a cuto parameter
 tends to innity. the similarity ow of corresponding eective hamiltonians is integrated
analytically and two counterterms depending on  are obtained in the initial hamiltonian: a
change in  and a change of g. in addition, the interaction vertex requires a -independent
counterterm that contains a boost invariant function of momenta of particles participating in
the interaction. the resulting eective hamiltonians contain a running coupling constant that
exhibits asymptotic freedom. the evolution of the coupling with changing width of eective
hamiltonians agrees with results obtained using feynman diagrams and dimensional regular-
ization when one identies the renormalization scale with the width. the eective light-front
schrodinger equation is equally valid in a whole class of moving frames of reference including
the innite momentum frame. therefore, the calculation described here provides an interesting
pattern one can attempt to follow in the case of hamiltonians applicable in particle physics.

1. introduction

similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians is a method suggested for
seeking solutions to qcd and other quantum eld theories en bloc including bound states, by
calculating manageable eective hamiltonians and solving schrodinger equations with them in a
series of successive approximations of increasing accuracy. this article describes an elementary
application of the similarity method in case of scalar elds, showing details of a calculation of one
boost-invariant running coupling constant in eective hamiltonians in third order perturbation
theory. we briey review the method, describe the simple example and present conclusions.

the method originates in the notion of renormalization group as discussed by wilson [1]
[2] and uses the idea of similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians [3] [4].
similarity enables us to avoid small energy denominators in perturbative evaluation of eec-
tive hamiltonians. the evaluation includes nding counterterms and dening renormalized
dynamics. small energy denominators could lead to large errors in the counterterms and in
calculation of eective hamiltonians. thus, if not avoided through similarity, the small de-
nominators would prevent precise theoretical predictions based on the eective schrodinger
equations.

the similarity procedure was invented to sort out complexities of the light-front form of
hamiltonian dynamics. this form was distinguished a long time ago by dirac [5] and more
recently became a natural candidate for description of hadronic constituents in hard scattering
processes [6] as well as in spectroscopy [7] using qcd. a recent review article by brodsky, pauli
and pinsky [8] provides a description of theoretical advances made in light-front formulation of
various theories mainly before invention or independently of the similarity procedure. reviews
by burkardt, harindranath and perry [9] help in understanding the scope of current approaches.
recent research in the direction of renormalization of hamiltonians can be traced through ref.
[10]. the present article is focused on similarity in light-front dynamics.

initial studies of quarkonium bound states, which are related to the similarity program
described in [7] have been performed by brisudova and perry, and brisudova, perry and wilson
[11] following the key observation by perry [12] that second order eective hamiltonian of qcd
contains a conning term, which may remain uncanceled in the eective schrodinger equation
dynamics. higher than second order calculations are needed for verifying this hypothesis.

since the formal front form of hamiltonian dynamics is invariant under boosts one hopes
it can provide a link between the structure of hadrons at rest and in the parton model. that
such unifying picture is hard to achieve in standard dynamical schemes is best illustrated by
the fact that despite extensive progress lattice gauge theory does not easily yield desired quark
and gluon bound state wave functions. [13] the light-front approach is still far from achieving
this goal, too. the present article shows the essence of boost invariance in similarity [14] but
the example we describe here is limited to scalar particles. the dynamics of scalars does not
involve genuine small-x singularities (x denotes a longitudinal momentum fraction carried by a
particle in the innite momentum frame) that appear in gauge theories and the present work
does not describe known particles.

the present paper also does not cover the step of solving the eective schrodinger equation.
it was shown in an asymptotically free matrix model [15] that one can achieve 10 % accuracy
in calculating bound state properties using second order eective hamiltonians but it is not
known yet if the same accuracy can be reached in any quantum eld theory of interest using

2

the boost-invariant similarity approach discussed here.

before we proceed to our example, we rst disclose the mechanism of preserving boost
invariance in the similarity approach. the following discussion points out relevant features of
the procedure using other methods for comparison.

the similarity renormalization group procedure leads to eective hamiltonians h = h0 +
hi, whose matrix elements between any two eigenstates of h0 vanish when the eigenvalues of
h0 for these states dier by more than the width . the word width is natural because
the eective hamiltonian matrix can be viewed as a band of non-zero matrix elements along
the diagonal and the width of the band depends on . another reason for the word width
is that the band structure is ensured by similarity form factors in interaction vertices. the
form factors are functions of energy transfers, they are peaked around zero and their half-width
depends on . the notion of the hamiltonian width is key to our method of preserving boost
invariance.

we shall take advantage of wegners equation [16] to indicate where the boost invariance
can enter the similarity procedure. wegner invented a ow equation for diagonalization of
hamiltonian matrices in solid state physics [16] [17] that is beautifully simple and can be
adapted to the similarity renormalization scheme [18] [15]. wegners equation for hamiltonian
matrices can be written as

d
ds

h =  [ [h, h0], h]

,

(1.1)

where s = 2. initial condition should be provided at s = 0, corresponding to  = , and the
initial hamiltonian is denoted by h. wegners commutator [h, h0] generates the similarity
transformation. one discovers a gaussian similarity factor by solving eq. (1.1) for the hi
matrix elements between eigenstates of matrix h0 keeping on the right-hand side only those
terms that are linear in hi and neglecting higher order terms.

wegners equation preserves necessary cluster decomposition properties [19]. the commu-
tator structure of wegners equation implies that no disconnected interactions are generated
by the transformation. wegners transformation depends only on dierences of energies and
spectator energies always drop out from the dierences. however, wegners generator is not
boost invariant.

seeking a boost invariant approach, one can apply eq.

(1.1) to light-front hamiltonian
)/p +, where the mass matrix contains
matrices. the matrices are of the form h = (p  2 + m 2
interactions, m 2
i, and p denotes total momenta of states with which one evaluates
the matrix elements. since the masses do not change the momenta, one can rewrite eq. (1.1)
in terms of the mass matrix elements as follows

 = m 2

0 +m 2

p + 2 d
ds

m 2

 =  [ [m 2

, m 2

0], m 2
]

.

(1.2)

we see that a rescaling of the ow parameter s with a momentum eigenvalue gives a ow
equation for the mass squared matrix elements. the latter should be independent of the eigen-
values p + and p . this feature of masses seems to suggest a boost invariant renormalization
procedure based on replacing p + 2/s by a new p +-independent ow parameter 4. but such
substitution breaks connection with wegners equation for hamiltonian matrices and leads
to violation of cluster decomposition properties, since the mass is not an additive quantity.

3

namely, the mass depends on the relative motion of particles and eective interactions become
dependent on spectators momentum.

despite this drawback, allen and perry [20] succeeded in demonstration that one can dene
and calculate a running coupling constant using eq. (1.2) for m 2 matrix elements replacing
p + 2/s with 4 in massless 3 theory in 6 dimensions. the authors demand that the ow from
some  to a fraction of  reproduces the same matrix elements structure in which only some
parameters change. this condition is implemented using transverse locality and it allows for
bypassing the step of nding initial conditions (counterterms) needed for dierential equations,
by introducing a running coupling constant. a question arises because studies of asymptotically
free matrix models [15] [21] show that eective hamiltonian matrices that are suitable for
bound state calculations may signicantly deviate from a self-replicating (xed point) ow
with one coupling constant. but in the case of many couplings helpful conditions may be
provided by coupling coherence [11], which may work in the approach of eq. (1.2) with a p +-
independent width parameter, assuming that the cluster property breaking does not complicate
the coherence. kylin, allen and perry [22] extended the approach of allen and perry to massive
particles.

the similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians is more exible in dening
its generator than eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) might suggest. this exibility is used to preserve boost
symmetry and cluster properties simultaneously. note that the boost invariance we talk about
means invariance under boosts along the front and boosts corresponding to rotations about
transverse axes in the innite momentum frame. these boosts are sucient for reaching states
in all possible uniform motions.

the desired boost-invariant operator formulation of similarity [14] is based on a transfor-
mation u that changes creation and annihilation operators of bare particles (denoted by q,
since they correspond to  = ) into creation and annihilation operators of eective particles
corresponding to the width  (denoted by q). namely,

q = u q u 


.

(1.3a)

u is secured to be unitary by construction. hamiltonian operators of all widths are assumed
equal and when they are expressed in terms of dierent creation and annihilation operators,
the coecient functions change. we have h(q) = h(q). assuming that hamiltonians
calculable in perturbation theory contain only nite products of creation and annihilation
operators and applying the transformation u, one obtains h  h(q) = u 
h(q)u.
this relation means that the operator h has the same coecient functions in front of products
of q as the eective hamiltonian h has in front of the unitarily equivalent products of q.
dierentiating h one obtains

where the generator t is related to u by

d
d

h =  [t, h]

,

t = u 



d
d

u

.

(1.3b)

(1.3c)

the script letters are introduced in eqs. (1.3a-c) to indicate that the operators can be con-
veniently thought about as expanded into sums of products of operators q. the latter are

4

independent of  and are not dierentiated in eqs. (1.3b-c). in other words, eqs. (1.3b-c) de-
scribe only the ow of coecients in front of the creation and annihilation operators. eective
hamiltonians are obtained from h using h(q) = uhu 
.

note that the operator u is analogous to the melosh operator [23]. the analogy stems from
that the eective particles corresponding to a small hamiltonian width  can be associated with
constituent quarks or gluons from hadronic rest frame spectroscopy while the bare particles with
   can be associated with current quarks and gluons from the innite momentum frame.
the boost-invariant similarity renormalization group procedure for light-front hamiltonians
[14] makes the notions of current and constituent quarks and gluons boost invariant. the
procedure provides a calculable dynamical content to the transformation that connects the
current and constituent particles independently of the reference frame one works in. this may
sound confusing if melosh transformation is associated with changing a frame of reference. but
the light-front dynamics is invariant with respect to boosts in perturbative calculations and this
property allows for translating a melosh-like transformation to one frame of reference, where it
simply relates bare particles and complex eective particles in one theory in the same frame.

boost invariance is guaranteed through the denition of the generator t. details will be
reviewed in the next section. the eective hamiltonian h is given by a diagonal proximum of
certain operator g, i.e. h = f[g], while the generator t is related to a diagonal remotum
of the same operator g. following [14], we introduce g = u 

gu and use

[t, h0] =

d
d

(1  f)[g]

.

(1.4)

the commutator structure guarantees that eective hamiltonians contain only connected in-
teractions.

now, the diagonal proximum can be dened in a boost-invariant way. the point is that
the operation f multiplies every interaction term in an eective hamiltonian by a form factor
which is a function of boost invariant combinations of momenta labeling creation and annihi-
lation operators in that interaction term. such combinations can include dierences or sums
of invariant masses. the resulting generator of the similarity transformation does not depend
on the total momentum of any state, contrary to eq. (1.2). according to [14], a necessary
rescaling of the ow parameter, analogous to rescaling provided by the total p + in eq. (1.2),
is provided for each hamiltonian term separately using a parent three-momentum for that
term. the parent momentum is dened as half of the sum of all momenta labeling creation
and annihilation operators in the term in question. all light-front hamiltonians we consider
are sums of terms which contain integrals over the parent momenta. usually, when a term acts
on some state, a parent momentum equals only some fraction of the total momentum of that
state. this fraction is dened by the single interaction act and lies in a range of values allowed
by momentum conservation in the eective schrodinger dynamics. thus, eective interactions
are independent of the total momenta of states they act on and no dependence on spectators
is generated. therefore, no cluster property is violated in dening the similarity generator
through eq. (1.4). a considerable freedom is still left in choosing details of f.

in summary, the exibility available in dening the similarity transformation generator can
be used to obtain a boost-invariant band-diagonal structure of eective hamiltonians preserving
cluster decomposition properties, through a suitable choice of the similarity form factors f.
this aspect of the procedure is the subject of the present article, quite independently of which

5

theory or singularity is addressed. naturally, the eective theory is easiest to make boost
invariant if the initial hamiltonian is regulated in a boost invariant way. for in that case the
counterterms do not have to correct the boost invariance breaking which a frame dependent
regularization would introduce. a suitable class of regularizations will be described in the next
section.

this paper is organized as follows. section 2 reviews necessary elements of ref.

[14] set
up for a third order calculation of the running coupling constant in hamiltonians of scalar
3 theory in 6 dimensions. the calculation is based on a plain power series expansion in the
coupling constant. counterterms are derived in section 3 and the eective coupling constant
ow is calculated in section 4. section 5 concludes the paper. appendix presents formulae for
third order eective vertex function with arbitrary momenta and masses.

2. effective hamiltonians

we focus our attention on a perturbative derivation of eective hamiltonians in scalar
quantum eld theory with an interaction term  3 in 6 dimensions. the theory is known to
be asymptotically free. the coupling constant in the initial regularized hamiltonian is assumed
to be innitesimally small. our procedure for calculating eective hamiltonians closely follows
ref. [14].

2.1 initial hamiltonian

the classical lagrangian of the scalar eld theory in question is

l =

the corresponding light-front hamiltonian reads [24] [25] (x = x0  x3)

a quantum eld (x) for x+ = 0 is expanded in its fourier components,

where the abbreviated notation for the integral means

,

(2.5)

together with [ak, aq] = [a

(2.6)

it is unique in comparison to hamiltonians in other forms of dynamics because there are no
terms that contain only creation or only annihilation operators in eq.
(2.6). this feature
is related to the problem of ground state formation, since h|0i = 0, where ak|0i = 0, and
only a
0 terms in h could alter this feature, but they are absent due to the cuto
+. readers interested in non-perturbative aspects of hamiltonian dynamics in the front form
should consult [26]. however, no problems with modes of k+ = 0 arise in perturbation theory
for hamiltonians in the present paper.

the initial hamiltonian for the similarity renormalization group procedure is obtained from
eq. (2.6) by introducing an additional ultraviolet regularization factor (to be described below)
and taking the limit +  0. the initial hamiltonian is denoted by h, since it corresponds
to the initial width  =  in the similarity ow, as discussed in the introduction. creation
and annihilation operators that appear in h were denoted in the introduction by q.

h contains a regularization factor denoted by r.  stands for an ultraviolet cuto
parameter. r  1 when   . in asymptotically free theories,  can be sent to innity
when the renormalization process passes the stage of calculating counterterms and deriving
eective hamiltonians of nite width . still, the initial hamiltonian contains counterterms
which depend on r and are denoted by x. besides diverging -dependent terms, x contains
also nite parts that remove -independent regularization eects caused by the factor r. thus,
we have

h = z [k]

the parameter + is set equal 0 and this is why it is not indicated, in distinction from eq. (2.6)
where it was kept larger than 0.

(2.7)

the regularization factor r has a simple form which results from the following steps (ap-
plicable to the interaction term written out explicitly in eq. (2.7) as well as to all counterterms
x derivable in perturbation theory). for a term containing a product of u creation and v
annihilation operators we dene a parent momentum, denoted by p +
uv, which equals half of
the sum of momenta labeling all the operators. for each momentum label ki, with i running
through u + v values, we introduce xi = k+
uv. the regularization factor
is dened as

uv and

where i = (xi) and  is a useful function of its argument. one natural choice is (x) = 1,
for it is simple. another choice is (x) = 1/x, a natural one because it appears in invariant

7

masses. we shall assume the function  lies between the two choices but otherwise it will be
left unspecied. leaving  unspecied will help us identify nite regularization eects.

consequently, the regularization factor in the second term in eq. (2.7) is

r = exp

(2.9)

where x1 = k+

the initial hamiltonian of the similarity renormalization group procedure in 3 theory in 6
dimensions is given by eq. (2.7). in order to derive the third order running coupling constant
in eective hamiltonians, we have to calculate x up to the terms order g3. the counterterms
are calculated order by order along the evaluation of renormalization group ow for eective
hamiltonians.

2.2 similarity flow of hamiltonians

the eective hamiltonians are written as

where

h = f[g]

,

g = ugu 



.

(2.10)

(2.11)

the operator g is divided into two parts, g = g0 + gi, where g0 = g(g = 0). gi satises
the following dierential equation as a consequence of eqs. (1.3a)-(1.4) (see ref. [14])

d

gi = "f gi, ( d

.

(2.12)

we dropped the subscript  on the right-hand side for clarity. f denotes the similarity form
factor introduced by f and the curly bracket with the subscript g0 denotes a solution for t
resulting from eq. (1.4). we will omit the subscript g0 from now on and the reader should
remember that a curly bracket implies an energy denominator for every term in the bracket,
i.e. a factor equal to inverse of the eigenvalue of g0 corresponding to momentum labels of all
annihilation operators in a term minus eigenvalue of g0 corresponding to all creation operators
in the term.

the similarity factor is dened for any operator of the form described above eq. (2.8) as

f(u, v) = exp [(m2

u = (k1 + ... + ku)2, where the minus compo-

let us denote dierentiation with respect to  by a prime and expand the eective interaction

in powers of the coupling constant g as

gi =

n

,



xn=1

(2.14)

where n denotes the sum of all terms order gn in g. equation (2.12) implies

 
n =

xk=1

[k, {(1  f )nk}]

,

and the rst three terms in the expansion satisfy the following equations

 
1 = 0

,

 
2 = [{f 1}, f 1]

,

 
3 = [f 1, {f 2 + (1  f ) 

2}] + [f 2, {f 1}]

.

(2.15)

(2.16a)

(2.16b)

(2.16c)

equation (2.16a) implies that 1 is independent of  and equals the second term in the
initial hamiltonian from eq.
in other words, 1 = 1. the corresponding eec-
tive hamiltonian interaction term is obtained by multiplying the integrand in eq. (2.7) by
f(12, 3) = exp {[(k1 + k2)2  2]2/4} and transforming operators ak into ak using u
after the evaluation process for g is carried out to the desired order.

(2.7).

this last step is unusual in the sense that the operator u depends on the regularization
(in scalar theory, the dependence is reduced to u being a functional of r) but, at the same
time it is unitary and thus, it transforms nite products of creation and annihilation operators
by eectively replacing everywhere a by a and no other trace of u is left in the eective

is determined up to terms order gn from eq. (1.4). t is antihermitian order by order and
determines a unitary u to order gn, denoted u (n)

 . therefore,

u (n)
 yiu

a

i yjv

aj u (n)



= yiu

i yjv

aj + o(gn+1)

,

(2.17)

and the regularization dependence of u does not show up in h to order gn once g is renor-
malized to order gn. in successive orders, by construction, the counterterms in g preserve
unitarity of u. a perturbative proof of renormalizability for eective hamiltonians would
require demonstration that there exists a set of counterterms that remove regularization de-
pendence from nite momentum parts of g to all orders of perturbation theory when   
(c.f. [3]) and that the resulting theory predicts covariant results. the present article does not
demonstrate such set exists in the case of 3 theory. also, our calculation is limited to terms
order g, g2 and g3. to verify that an eective hamiltonian containing a running coupling con-
stant order g3 may produce covariant results for scattering processes, the present calculation
must be extended to 4th order.

the transformation connecting two eective hamiltonians with dierent nite widths 1
and 2 is given by u1u 
2. one can easily see that the latter is free from dependence on r
once g is made independent of r. it is sucient to observe that for an innitesimal dierence
between 1 and 2 the eective transformation u1u 
2 is given by the similarity generator
that is expressed in terms of the r-independent g. integrating the innitesimal changes one
obtains the same conclusion for nite changes of the width.

evaluation of 2 and 3 involves calculation of two counterterms. both 2 and 3 are more

complicated in structure than 1 and their evaluation requires new notation. namely,

1 = 21 + 12

,

2 = 11 + 31 + 13 + 22

,

3 = 21 + 12 + 41 + 14 + 32 + 23

.

(2.18a)

(2.18b)

(2.18c)

each term contains products of creation and annihilation operators with xed numbers of the
operators in a product. the rst subscript indicates the number of creation operators, a
,
and the second subscript denotes the number of annihilation operators, a. for all the terms,
uv = 

vu.

equations (2.16a-b) imply for second order terms the following relations [14],


31 = 2f2[2121]31


13 = 2f2[1212]13

j]. the remaining prod-
ucts of operators contain as many creation and annihilation operators as indicated by the
bracket subscripts, in the normal order, according to the same convention as in eqs. (2.18a-
c). the factor f2 depends on the momenta labeling creation and annihilation operators. in
eqs. (2.19a-d), the brackets with operators involve integrals over three-dimensional momentum
labels of all creation and annihilation operators and over loop momenta in loops that result
from contractions (in second order here only eq. (2.19c) for 
11 contains a loop integral). the
factor f2 is understood to appear under the integrals. symbolically, its structure appears in
eq. (2.16b) and reads f2 = {f }f  f {f }. the negative sign results from the commutator
in eq. (2.16b) that guarantees that only connected terms appear in the eective interactions.
this is a general property of the similarity procedure.

the factor f2 is the only factor depending on  on the right-hand side of eqs. (2.19a-d).

therefore, solutions are

3. counterterms through order g3

the two counterterms, 11 from eq. (2.20c) and 21 from eq. (2.25), are calculated
using the equations they appear in. the counterterms are determined by the condition that
those equations are independent of r when    for arbitrary nite values of  and particle
momenta. we rst describe calculation of 11 and then 21.

 and function . a nite, regularization dependent part of the result remains undetermined.
therefore, we have to adjust its value to data.

logarithmic dependence on  arises for  > 0. the value of 2

by solving a single physical meson eigenvalue problem, expressing the physical meson mass
in terms of 2
0 and adjusting the latter to obtain the gedanken experimental mass value for
mesons.

3.2 coupling constant counterterm

the coupling constant counterterm 21 is evaluated from eq. (2.25). the mass squared
counterterms cancel quadratic and part of logarithmic divergences so that the vertex countert-
erm is needed to remove only logarithmically divergent and nite regularization eects.

the interaction term 21 has the form

21 = z [k1k2k3] 2(2)55(k1 + k2  k3) [(k1, k2, k3) + (k1, k2, k3)] a

(3.6)
the counterterm function (k1, k2, k3) originates from 21 in eq. (2.25). since the similarity
renormalization group procedure preserves canonical symmetries of light-front hamiltonians,
the functions (k1, k2, k3) and (k1, k2, k3) depend only on variables x1 and 
12, introduced
in eq. (2.9).

(3.8)

the bare boson mass, , can be replaced by a nite constant of the same dimension in the case
of massless bosons.

equation (3.8) says that the diverging regularization dependence of the interaction vertex,
the term proportional to log , is independent of the particle momenta and one can
i.e.
remove the divergence by merely changing the initial coupling constant g in eq. (2.7). thus,
no diverging x-dependent counterterms are required - dierent situation than in [29]. however,
it is visible that the vertex contains a nite regularization dependent part that is a function of
x1. the function depends on our choice for . one could completely subtract the -dependence
for arbitrary choices of  by dening a counterterm that contains a negative of the -dependent
part of the right-hand side of eq. (3.8). for example, if  = 1 one has c = 4 + 2(x1/x)2 and
d = 4. integration produces a smooth and slowly varying function of x1, which needs to be
subtracted.

since the whole regularization eect is independent of  and 

12, it can be completely
removed from (x1, 
12) by subtracting 0(x1, 0), where 0 is chosen arbitrarily. however,
one has to add back the nite regularization independent part of 0(x1, 0), which will be
denoted below by 0(x1). the function 0(x1) is necessary to recover poincare symmetry of
observables. regularization spoils poincare symmetry. the symmetry may be restored once
counterterms remove regularization eects, but one is not allowed to change terms independent
of regularization. therefore, the function 0(x1) must be reinserted. this function is not altered
when  changes and could be considered marginal in analogy with usual renormalization group
analysis.

although one can isolate nite -dependent functions of x1 in the eective vertex, for
the particular choice of the regularization factors we adopt, the ultimate adjustment of the
function 0(x1) has to be delayed until 4th order calculations are completed. for there exists
in 3 theory no 3rd order scattering amplitude one could use to nd out what function 0(x1)
renders poincare symmetry of scattering observables with our choice of r in eq. (2.7). it will
be interesting to see if the explicit dependence on  isolates the same function as required by
the symmetry. however, it should be pointed out that the function does not inuence the way
the 3rd order running coupling constant in eective hamiltonians depends on .

15

the counterterm function (k1, k2, k3)  (x1), which removes the regularization depen-

dence from the eective vertex reads

(x1) =  0(x1, 0) + 0(x1)

.

(3.9a)

it can be used to dene a new regularization dependent coupling constant g in the initial
hamiltonian in eq. (2.7). we select a convenient value of x1 = x0 and obtain

g

+ (x0) =

where 0  0(x0). using eq. (3.8), we see that the initial coupling g is replaced by the new
-dependent quantity

g = g"1  g2

4(4)3 log



m0# + o(g5)

.

(3.9c)

with certain constant m0. thus, the theory exhibits asymptotic freedom in 3rd order terms.
our result agrees with literature, say eq. (7.1.26) from [28], in the sense that when we change
, the change required in the coupling constant in the initial hamiltonian for obtaining -
independent eective hamiltonians matches the change implied by feynman diagrams and
dimensional regularization. comparison with feynman calculus will be farther discussed below.
having derived the structure of counterterms we can proceed to evaluation of the nite

similarity ow of eective hamiltonians towards small widths .

4. running coupling constant

our procedure for evaluating the running coupling constant in hamiltonians follows theory
from [3] and [4] using [14]. the procedure has been outlined in a matrix model example in [15].
here, we use particle creation and annihilation operators in a boost invariant way, instead of
matrix elements.

the initial hamiltonian interaction vertex depends on regularization through the factor
r and corresponding counterterm. the bare coupling constant g is replaced by the coupling
constant g according to eqs. (3.9a-c), i.e.

g = g  2h0(x0, 0)  0i

.

(4.1)

the factor 2 is needed because g/2 appears in the hamiltonian. both 0(x0) and 0 are
proportional to g3. inverting the series (4.1) one can express g in terms of g.

evaluation of 21 in eq. (3.6) leads now to a nite expression, which has a limit when

  . in that limit, the eective hamiltonian interaction term takes the form

h21 = z [k1k2k3] 2(2)55(k1 + k2  k3) f[(k1 + k2)2, k2

.

(4.3a)

it is natural to use x0 = x10. then,

g = g + 2 (x10, 

120)

.

(4.3b)

this equation demonstrates that the eective coupling constant g depends on the value of the
nite function 0(x1) in the counterterm at one point, the same as the one used to dene g.
suppose that for the chosen value of  = 0, the running coupling constant should have the

value g0 = g0, determined from comparison with experiment. then,

where g in terms order g3 is replaced by g. inverting this series expansion we obtain

g0 = g + 20(x10,

it remains to calculate the dependence of g on , which requires a choice of the momentum
conguration (x10, 
120). the particular choice we will adopt is suitable for massless bare bosons,
i.e. for  = 0. our choice would require a change for  > 0, to avoid vanishing of similarity
factors when 2/x10 tends to innity. but the change is not signicant since  > 0 introduces
no alteration in our procedure apart from the change of momentum conguration, and it also
does not interfere with boost-invariance. therefore, we will limit details of our presentation
to the simplest massless case, using a momentum conguration that is most convenient when
 = 0. we also continue to keep x0 in eq. (3.9b) equal to x10. for  > 0 one has to make
x0 greater than 0, too. other choices of the momentum congurations than we adopt here are
equally possible in the case  = 0. the one we choose is particularly suitable for executing
integrals over the loop momenta and extracting the running coupling dependence on the width
 analytically. expressions for (x1, 

12) for   0 are given in appendix.
in the massless case, the most convenient conguration is x10 = 0 and 

120 = 0. for massive
120 6= 0 in 3
particles one considers 1 > x10 > 0 but there is no compelling reason to consider 
theory even for massive particles. note that the parent momentum k3 in eq. (4.2) is arbitrary
and not limited by our choice of the momentum conguration (x10, 
120). this feature is not
readily available when one considers only specic matrix elements of eective hamiltonians or
when explicit boost invariance is not preserved by the renormalization group procedure.

this equation demonstrates the same  function for coupling constants in eective hamiltonians
as obtained in lagrangian approaches using feynman diagrams and dimensional regularization,
when one identies the renormalization scale with the hamiltonian width . this is encour-
aging but one needs to remember that for comparison of perturbative scattering amplitudes in
hamiltonian and lagrangian approaches it is necessary to make additional calculations and at
least of fourth order in g. beyond model matrix studies such as in [15], 4th order similarity
calculations have so far been carried out only in simplied yukawa model by mas lowski and
wieckowski [30].

(4.11)

which shows our result for a boost invariant running coupling constant in eective hamiltonians.
our procedure explains how the running coupling constant can be included in quantum me-
chanics of eective particles, which is given by the schrodinger equation with the corresponding
hamiltonian h.

5. conclusion

a remarkable result of the whole procedure in the case of asymptotically free scalar dynamics
is an extremely simple structure of diverging counterterms and a complete control over involved
eective interactions, in perturbation theory. our operator calculus preserves cluster properties
and allows for evaluation of eective hamiltonians without limitation to any particular set of
matrix elements. in other words, we can easily derive integral expressions for matrix elements
of eective hamiltonians in the whole fock space spanned by basis states of eective particles.
the renormalization group equations are integrated analytically using gaussian similarity form
factors. also, the unitary nature of the similarity transformation for eective particle creation
and annihilation operators removes wave function renormalization constant from the procedure.
however, the regularization factor introduced in the initial hamiltonian requires an additional
nite counterterm that contains a boost invariant function of longitudinal momentum fractions.
the renormalization group ow for hamiltonians diers from standard procedures applied
to s-matrix. the key dierence from standard procedures is that the running coupling constant
is derived as a coecient in front of a certain term in an eective renormalized light-front hamil-
tonian instead of a lagrangian term or in a scattering amplitude. the advantage of knowing
an eective hamiltonian is that not only one can attempt to describe scattering processes but
also bound states using the corresponding eigenvalue equation.

note that the light-front form of relativistic quantum eld dynamics re-denes the vacuum
problem in a way that is only partly understood.
[7] [26] but the present calculation shows
that running coupling constant calculations can be consistently carried out in lowest orders of
perturbation theory without inclusion of perturbative modications of the vacuum state. this
leads to a new demand for similar perturbative analysis of theories that may include eects
usually thought to be associated with ground state properties, the closest being a scalar theory
with quartic interaction term and innitesimally small coupling constant.

obviously, a more sophisticated treatment is necessary in gauge theories for many reasons
but, in particular, because they require an additional cuto limiting the longitudinal momentum
fractions from below. the small-x cuto appears in the unitary transformation u as well as
in the transformations u1u 
2, the former depending on and the latter being independent of
the ultraviolet cuto . this dierence between the small-x cuto and the ultraviolet cuto
cannot be studied in the case of scalar elds discussed in the present paper. however, the third
order boost-invariant similarity factors we derived in the case of 3 directly apply, for example,
in calculation of a triple-gluon vertex in eective qcd.

finally, we wish to stress the dierence between the regularized initial hamiltonian for
bare particles and the small width hamiltonian for eective particles, which contains similarity
form factors f. the form factors dampen interactions changing invariant masses by more

19

than  and thus can tame the spread of eigenstate wave functions for low lying eigenvalues
into regions of high relative momenta of constituents. this feature may lead to exponential
convergence of the eigenstate expansion in the eective particle basis. such convergence is
not expected in the case of bare particles. the ne structure of eective particles would then
unfold in the transformation u1u 
2 relating eective degrees of freedom at two dierent scales,
one corresponding to the binding scale and the other to the high momentum transfer probe
in question. this picture encourages opinion that the present calculation provides a pattern
worth trying in application to realistic theories.
