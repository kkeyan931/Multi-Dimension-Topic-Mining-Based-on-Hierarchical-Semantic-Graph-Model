abstract

we present two new solutions of romans massive type iia supergravity char-
acterized by the two non-trivial massive potentials of romans theory: the nsns
2-form and the rr 7-form. they can be interpreted respectively as the intersection
of a fundamental string and a d8-brane over a d0-brane and the intersection of a d6-
brane with a d8-brane over a nsns5-brane. the d8-brane manifests itself through
the mass parameter and in the massless limit one recovers the standard fundamental
string and d6-brane solutions.

although these solutions do not have the usual form for bps bound states at
threshold and each of them involves 3 objects, both of them preserve 1/4 of the
supersymmetries.

introduction

supergravity theories (and specially suegras4) are the low-energy eective actions of
string theories and therefore harbor elds corresponding to the string massless modes. in
particular they contain p + 1-form potentials whose sources can be identied with pertur-
bative and non-perturbative string theory p- and p = d  p  4-dimensional objects: the
fundamental string, the solitonic 5-brane and the dirichlet dp-branes.

type iia superstring theory contains dp-branes with p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 [1]. however, the
standard type iia suegra [2, 3, 4] only contains rr potentials for the rst four cases.
it was later realized [5, 6] that since an 8-brane couples to a 9-form potential which can
be dualized into a constant parameter (-1-form eld strength), the low-energy theory of
the type iia superstring is romans massive type iia theory [7], until then considered an
exotic deformation of the standard theory.

romans theory contains a constant parameter m with dimensions of mass which can
be interpreted as the hodge dual of the 10-form eld strength associated to a d8-brane
[6]. the d8-brane carries no dynamical degrees of freedom and should be interpreted as
a background for the type iia theory. this is however very non-trivial background: the
parameter not only appears in the action through a kinetic-like term

z d10xq|g| h 1

2 m2i ,

with the (in)dependence of the dilaton characteristic of rr potentials (in the string frame),
but also appears as a mass parameter for the nsns 2-form.

romans massive type iia theory has many mysterious features.

in particular, its
11-dimensional origin (and that of the d8-brane) cannot be the standard 11-dimensional
supergravity and one has to appeal to non-covariant generalizations associated to back-
grounds with special isometric directions [8, 9, 10] (see also [11, 12]).

the physical reason why the nsns 2-form b gets a mass in this background is not
well understood either although this is the most notorious feature of this theory, perhaps
because it has not been fully appreciated. actually, the mass term for b has been ignored in
the search for supersymmetric solutions describing the intersection of fundamental strings
or solitonic 5-branes with d8-branes5.

furthermore, in ref. [8] a previously ignored mass term for the rr 7-form potential

c (7) was shown to occur.

in this letter we will present two supersymmetric solutions of massive type iia sue-
gra for which these two mass terms do not vanish. the rst solution which we will call
massive string has a non-trivial b eld (plus metric and dilaton). it preserves 1/4 of the
supersymmetries and contains an arbitrary harmonic function allowing for the description
of several objects in equilibrium. in the massless limit it becomes the fundamental string
solution [16] and it will be interpreted as the intersection of a fundamental string with a d8-
brane, the former occupying the only direction orthogonal to the latter. it can be argued

4super-extended-gravity theories.
5m-brane and dp-brane intersections were rst discussed in refs. [13, 14, 15].

that there is a d0-brane present at the intersection. the existence of this conguration
was demonstrated in ref. [17].

the second solution, which we will call massive d6-brane has a nontrivial c (7) eld
(plus metric and dilaton. consistency of the equations of motion requires the presence of
a non-trivial b. this solution also preserves 1/4 of the supersymmetries and contains an
arbitrary harmonic function allowing for the description of several objects in equilibrium.
in the massless limit the b eld vanishes and the solution becomes the d6-brane solution
and it will be interpreted as the intersection of a d6-brane with a d8-brane over 5 spacelike
directions. however, the presence of the b eld in the massive case will be interpreted as
a solitonic 5-brane living in the intersection.

1 massive type iia suegra

here we give the bosonic equations of motion and the fermionic supersymmetry transfor-
mation laws of massive type iia suegra in the string frame including the dual rr and
nsns potentials. many of the general expressions are also valid for the iib theory. due
to the explicit occurrence of potentials in the action, they can only be dualized on-shell.
the dual potentials are dened by the relations between eld strengths

h (7) = e2h ,

d(cid:16)e2h (7)(cid:17) = 0 ,




where we are using the notation [18, 19, 8] in which which forms of dierent degrees are
formally combined into a single entity:

c = c (0) + c (1) + c (2) + . . . ,

g = g(0) + g(1) + g(2) + . . . .

these expressions are valid both for the type iib and for the massive type iia theory if
one selects respectively odd and even rank and odd rank rr dierential form eld strengths
and one makes the identication

the eld strengths that correspond to these bianchi identities and equations of motion

g(0) = m .

are given by

where calligraphic elds belong to the iib theory.

these equations have to be supplemented by the dilaton equation of motion

r + 4 ()2  42 + 1

and the einstein equation of motion (where we have already eliminated r with the use of
the dilaton equation of motion)

these equations are also valid both for the type iia and iib theories. observe that the
contributions of the energy-momentum tensors of dual elds add up, except in the n = 5
case.

as explained in the introduction, the mass parameter occurs in the form of a cos-
mological constant (or, in the einstein frame, of an unbound potential for the dilaton).
furthermore, the eld strengths of c (1) and b(6) contain the terms

g(2) = dc (1) + mb ,

h (7) = db(6)  mc (7) + . . .




associated to these terms there are two massive gauge transformations

(12)

(13)

c (1) = m(1) ,

b = d(1) ,




b(6) = m(6) ,

c (7) = d(6) ,




using which one can completely eliminate c (1) and b(6) everywhere. then, the kinetic
terms of these stuckelberg elds become mass terms for b and c (7) respectively. only
these two terms are massive.

now, solutions describing p-branes in massive type iia suegra are automatically
solutions describing the intersection of those p-branes with a d8-brane associated to the
mass parameter. general solutions for the intersection of p1 and p2 branes have been found
in the literature using a generic model whose action contains only kinetic terms for the
dilaton and the (p1 + 2)- and (p2 + 2)-form eld strengths. therefore, those solutions
can potentially describe correctly intersections involving a d8-brane and a d0-, d2- and
d4-brane, associated to massless elds. however, they cannot correctly describe the inter-
sections of a d8-brane and a fundamental string, a solitonic 5-brane or a d6-brane. study
of the supersymmetry algebra reveals that these solutions should exist and preserve 1/4
or the supersymmetries [17]. in the next two sections we will present the corresponding
solutions and will comment on some of their unusual features.

2 massive string

this solution is given by

where

ds2 = 1 (dt2  dy2)  d~x 2
8 ,

bty =  (1  1) ,

c (1)

t = my ,

e2 =  ,




5

(14)

~x8 = (x1, . . . , x8) = (xm) ,

mm = m2 ,

(15)

y = m .




this solution has the following properties:

1. the function  consists of three pieces: a piece linear in y (which is interpreted as the
coordinate along the string and perpendicular to the d8-brane), a piece quadratic in
~x8 (which are interpreted as the worldvolume coordinates of the d8-brane, orthogonal
to the string) and a harmonic function of ~x8:

 = my  xp

mpxpxp + h(~x8) , xp

mp = 1

2m2 ,

mmh = 0 .

(16)

thus, it can describe, in principle, several objects in equilibrium.

2. in the massless limit (y, ~x8) = h(~x8) and for the right choice of h it is just the

fundamental string solution [16].

3. the limit in which the string is eliminated is unattainable from this solution. even
if we set h = 0  is still non-trivial and the solution will have only 1/4 of the
supersymmetries unbroken.

4. the c (1) eld can be completely gauged away, canceling the 1 in bty. we have
introduced it in order to have bty in the form which corresponds to a fundamen-
tal string source.
(it can be argued that there is a d0-brane in the intersection
between the string and the d8-brane, as we will see when we study the unbroken
supersymmetry the solution.)

5. we have a solution for any value of the constant . however, only for  = 1 the

solution is supersymmetric. this is a quite unusual behavior

let us now nd the unbroken supersymmetries. we will only analyze the dilatino

supersymmetry rule to show how it works. in this case

with

2 1mm  1

2 1/2yy ,

6 g(2) = 2m0y .

6

(17)

(18)

substituting into the dilatino supersymmetry rule we nd

 1

21mm h1  0y11i   1
the rst term cancels if we impose

2 1/2yy + i

4 m1/2 h5  30y11i  = 0 .

1

2 h1  0y11i  = 0 ,

(19)

(20)

which is the condition satised by the killing spinor of the fundamental string. this
operator is a projector and therefore has eigenvalues 1 or 0. the trace is 16, one half of
the trace of the identity and therefore this condition breaks a half of the supersymmetries.
using this condition also in the third term we get

which is solved by  = 1 and

 yy + im = 0 ,

m 1

2 [1  iy]  = 0 ,

(21)

(22)

which is the condition satised by the killing spinor of a d8-brane. for analogous reasons,
this second condition breaks a half of the supersymmetries for m 6= 0. these two projectors
commute and therefore both conditions can be fullled simultaneously. since the trace of
the product of both projectors is 8, 1/4 of the supersymmetries are preserved.

the gravitino equation also vanishes if the killing spinor is

 = 1/40 ,

(23)

where 0 is a constant spinor satisfying the above constraints.

now, observe that if the killing spinor is an eigenspinor of the fundamental string and

d8-brane projectors, then it obeys automatically

1

2 h1  i011i  = 0 ,

(24)

which is the condition of the d0-brane killing spinor. this may seem a bit surprising since
c (1) is trivial (unless y is a compact coordinate). however, its eld strength g(2), which is
the meaningful quantity is not trivial.

for all these reasons one can identify this solution with the intersection of fundamental

string and a d8-brane over a d0-brane7.

7a string solution to a class of massive supergravity theories was recently given in [20]. however, the
mass parameter in that model is of nsns type and there is no mass term for b. thus it cannot describe
the fundamental string of the massive type iia theory.

7

3 massive d6-brane

this solution is given by

ds2 = 1/2 (dt2  d~y 2

6 )  1/2d~x 2
3 ,

bmn =  m

3 mnpxp ,

b(6)

ty2y6 = my1 ,

c (7)

ty1y6 =  (1  1) ,

e2 = 3/2 ,




where

~y6 = (y1, . . . , y6) = (yi) ,

~x3 = (x1, x2, x3) = (xm) ,

mm = m2 ,

y1 = m .




some remarks are necessary:

(25)

(26)

1. as c (1) in the massive string case, b(6) is pure gauge but we have introduced it only

for the sake of consistency.

2. b is not pure gauge. a non-trivial c (7) (necessary for a d6-brane) implies a non-
trivial h (7) and, by hodge duality, a nontrivial h and a non-trivial b. this (plus
the constraints of unbroken supersymmetry) will give support to the interpretation
that there is a solitonic 5-brane in the intersection.

3. the coordinate y1 has been chosen for simplicity but any other direction in the
d6-brane worldvolume (coordinates (t, yi)) would do as direction orthogonal to the
solitonic 5-brane and d8-brane.

4. again, the function  consists of three pieces: a piece linear in y1 (the coordinate
orthogonal to the solitonic 5-brane and the d8-brane), a piece quadratic in ~x3 (which
are interpreted as worldvolume coordinates of the d8-brane, orthogonal to both the
solitonic 5-brane and the d8-brane) and a harmonic function of ~x3:

 = my1  xp

mpxpxp + h(~x3) , xp

mp = 1

2m2 ,

mmh = 0 .

(27)

thus, it can describe, in principle, several objects in equilibrium.

8

5. in the massless limit (y1, ~x3) = h(~x3) and the right choice of h it is just the

d6-brane solution.

6. we have a solution for any value of the constant . however, only for  = 1 the
solution is supersymmetric. actually, one nds that (for those values of ) the killing
spinor is

where 0 is a constant spinor which satises

 = 1/80 ,

1

2 (1  i016) 0 = 0 ,

m 1

2 [1  iy] 0 = 0 .




if both equations are satised, then the following equation is satised

1

2 h1  026i  = 0 ,

(28)

(29)

(30)

which is the condition satised by the solitonic 5-brane killing spinor.

it is reasonable to identify these solution with the intersection of a d6- and d8-brane

over a solitonic 5-brane.

4 conclusion

we have presented two new supersymmetric solutions of massive type iia suegra which
have interpreted as the intersection of a string and a d6-brane with a d8-brane over a
d0-brane and a solitonic 5-brane respectively. they have a number of remarkable features
some of them quite unusual: the massless limit exists (this is the limit in which the d8-
brane is removed) but the other limits do not exist. the fact that they consist of 3-objects
but 1/4 of the supersymmetries is preserved has also been observed in other contexts.
furthermore, the string solutions is completely localized and depends on all coordinates
except on time.

it would be interesting to nd other solutions of massive type iia suegra and to

study their possible 11-dimensional origin. work on this direction is in progress.
