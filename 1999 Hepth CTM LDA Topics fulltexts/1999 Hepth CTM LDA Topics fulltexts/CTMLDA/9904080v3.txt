abstract

the higgs model is generalized so that in addition to the radial higgs eld
there are elds which correspond to the themasy and entropy. the model
is further generalized to include state and sign parameters. a reduction to
the standard higgs model is given and how to break symmetry using a non-
zero vev (vacuum expectation value) is shown. a uid rotation can be
performed on the standard higgs model to give a model dependent on the
entropy and themasy and with a constant mass.

a perfect uid has a lagrangian formulation in which the lagrangian is the pressure
p. variation is achieved by using the rst law of thermodynamics

dp = n dh  nt ds,

(1)

where n is the particle number, t is the temperature, s is the entropy, and h the
enthalpy. in four dimensions a vector can be decomposed into four scalars, however
the ve scalar decomposition

hv = w =  + x

i

(i)s(i),

vv  = 1,

(2)

(i) = 1, 2 is often used, because for i = 1, s and  = r t d have interpretation,
roberts (1997) [3], as the entropy and the thermasy respectively. from now on the
index (i) is suppressed as it is straightforward to reinstate. replacing the rst law
with dp = vdw   nt ds, variation gives the familiar stress and scalar evolution
equations. previously, roberts (1997) [3], all partial derivatives in the above have
been replaced with vector covariant derivatives

d =  + ie a,

(3)

to obtain a generalization of scalar electrodynamics called uid electrodynamics.
for many interacting uids the interaction terms can be disregarded, anile (1990)
[4], however here all interaction terms are kept. quantization of these models is not
looked at here although uids can be quantized, roberts (1999) [5]. here instead of
using the rst law for variation a specic explicit lagrangian is assumed. this xes
the equation of state. since previous work three things are approached dierently.
the rst is the best conventions for the scalar decomposition are 2. this is because
the spacetime index is put on s as this will allow easier generalization to second order
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, isreal and stewart (1979) [6]. the + convention
is used for  and s in 2 (rather than s). the second is that the uid remains
isentropic after charging. the third is that two vector normalization conditions
are required after charging. equivalences between uids and scalar elds were rst
studies by tabensky and taub (1973) [7]. thermodynamical quantities can be
introduced into the standard higgs model via the partition function kapusta (1989)
[8]. clearly the entropy, temperature and so on cannot occur from both the vector
2 and the partition function, perhaps a suitable partition function for the present
model might allow both to be identied. an approach which dispenses with higgs
elds is that of nicholson and kennedy (2000) [9], another approach which involves
gravity is that of kakushadze and langfelder (2000) [10].

2 explicit lagrangians

consider the lagrangian

l(q, q) = (ww )r  q(q),

(4)

where r is called the equation of state parameter (see equation 9),  is called the
sign parameter and q is the potential. varying with respect to the metric and then
assuming the stress is of the form of a perfect uid implies

 2(1)rrw 2r2

 ww = (p + )vv.

(5)

normalization v 2

 = 1 and hv = w implies

w 2r

 = (1)rh2r.

recall that l = p, together with the above three equations this gives

p = h  q,  = (2r  1)h2r + q, n = 2rh2r1.

varying l with respect to ,  and s respectively

(nv )  q = 0,  n s  q = 0,

(nv )  q = 0,

this is a perfect uid; when q = 0 it has the -equation of state

1 <  =

2r

2r  1

< 2,



2  2

= r <

.

(9)

particular cases are r = 1 which implies  = 2 which is the equation of state for
coherent radiation; and r = 2 which implies  = 4
3 which is the equation of state for
incoherent radiation. the canonical momenta are

 = n,  = 0, s = n.

the constrained hamiltonian is

h = (  +  s) + 1(s  ) + 2  l,

(10)

(11)

where 1 and 2 are the lagrange multipliers. the momenta and hamiltonian
are the same as in the general case. in the general case the euler equations and
the canonical stress vanish identically; however for explicit lagrangians the euler
equations are the same as 8 and the canonical stress is the same as the stress.

3 charged explicit lagrangian.

all partial derivatives are replaced by vector covariant derivative 1. capital letters
are used for the new quantities and small letters for the uncharged quantities. the
lagrangian becomes

l  l = (ww )r  q(q) 

1
4

f 2,

where * denotes complex conjugate. the vector eld becomes

w =  + s + i( + s)ea = w + iea,

where e  ( + s)e. under the global transformations

(13)

  exp(ie),

s  exp(ie)s,

  , a  a + ,

(14)

the vector eld changes to w  exp(ie)w so that ww  is invariant, implying
that the lagrangian is invariant. one can choose that a = 0 and then these
transformations are local. the noether current is

j  = r(ww )r1 {i(ew  ew) + 2eea} .

one can introduce two normalization conditions

vv  = 1,

vv = 1,

h 2 = h2  e2a2
,

which imply

f 2, n = 2rh 2r1,

(18)

and the canonical momenta are

 = n,  = 0, s = n, a = 0,

(19)

the last of which is surprising; because not all the components of a vanish in
usual gauged scalar electrodynamics. the stress is

note that if one starts with the electrodynamical lagrangian l = f 2/4 and tries
to implement a substitution scheme from this via a  a+kw one cannot recover
the above type of charged uids because f 2  f 2+ second derivatives in the scalar
elds, which do not occur in the above. thus there is no mirror mechanism.

to recover scalar electrodynamics rst note that

now set the state parameter r = 1, the sign parameter  = 1, and the potential
q(q) = v (2) so that

starting with scalar electrodynamics and identifying  with 
e does not give one of
the above uids as gradients in  appear. alternatively there is the vector uid
rotation

(30)

e gives a uid of the above type. one can then assume a vev < 0| 

starting with scalar electrodynamics and performing this rotation and replacing 
with 
e |0 > to
generate a constant mass term as above, the dierence being that some account of
thermodynamics has been achieved.
