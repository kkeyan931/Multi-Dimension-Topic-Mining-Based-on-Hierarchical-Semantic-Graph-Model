(2.6) thus a2m +2 = 1, y(ax, a2e, l) another solution original problem (2.1). setting = exp(i/(m +1)) therefore set solutions yk yk(x, e, l) = k/2y(kx, 2ke, l) , (2.7) yk subdominant sk dominant sk1. (our convention diers {$9812211$} factor k/2, included later convenience.) consequence facts pair {yk, yk+1} provides set linearly independent solutions second-order equation (2.1), solution expanded terms them. particular, yk1(x, e, l) = ck(e, l)yk(x, e, l) + ck(e, l)yk+1(x, e, l) . (2.8) functions ck ck called stokes multipliers yk1 respect yk yk+1. follows (2.7) ck(e, l) = ck1(2e, l) ck(e, l) = ck1(2e, l). brevity write c0 c0 c c respectively. (again, dier slightly conventions {$9812211$}, abbreviations c c instead reserved c1 c1.) stokes multipliers expressed terms wronskians. recall wronskian w  two functions f (x) g(x) dened w  = f g fg . (2.9) f g solve schrodinger equation (2.1), w  independent x; furthermore, vanishes f g linearly dependent. taking wronskian (2.8) k = 0 y1 y0 shows c = w1,1 w0,1 , c = w1,0 w0,1 , (2.10) used abbreviation wk1,k2 w . wronskians entire functions e l. since y0 y1 independent, w0,1 never vanishes, c c also entire. fact, ck identically equal 1 {$9812211$}. follows (2.10) relations wk1+1,k2+1(e, l) = wk1,k2(2e, l) w0,1(e, l) = 2i. (the second found evaluating w0,1 x tends innity sectors s0 s1, asymptotic behaviours y0 y1 derivatives determined (2.2) 4 (2.3).) since y1(x, e, l) = y1(x, e, l), also follows (2.10) c(e, l) real whenever e l real. basic stokes relation (2.8) k = 0 therefore c(e, l)y0(x, e, l) = y1(x, e, l) + y1(x, e, l) c(e, l) = 1 2i w1,1(e, l) . (2.11) (2.12) (2.11) rewritten terms becomes c(e, l)y(x, e, l) = 1/2y(x, 2e, l) + 1/2y(1x, 2e, l) (2.13) x formally set zero, exactly form (1.9) a+(, p), albeit specic value 2/4 p e2ip = 1/2.
