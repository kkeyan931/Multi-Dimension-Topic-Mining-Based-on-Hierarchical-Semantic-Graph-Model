abstract

a r dual transform is introduced which relates quantum field theory and string regimes,
both in a curved background with d-non compact dimensions. this operation maps the char-
acteristic length of one regime into the other (and, as a consequence, mass domains as well).
the r-transform is not an assumed or a priori imposed symmetry but is revealed by the qft
and string dynamics in curved backgrounds. the hawking-gibbons temperature and the string
maximal or critical temperature are r-mapped one into the other. if back reaction of quantum
matter is included, quantum field theory and string phases appear, and r-relations between
them manifest as well. these r-transformations are explicitly shown in two relevant examples:
black hole and de sitter space times.

the combined study of quantum field theory (qft) and string theory (st) in curved space
times - and in the framework of the string analogue model - allows to go further in the understand-
ing of quantum gravity eects ref. [1,2,3,4]. here, qft and st are both dened in a non compact
d-dimensional background (although some of the dimensions could eventually be compactied).

the string analogue model (or thermodynamical approach) is a suitable framework for this
purpose. strings are considered as a collection of quantum elds n which do not interact among
themselves but are coupled to the curved background, and whose masses are given by the degenerated
string spectrum in this background. the higher mass spectrum is described by the density of string
mass levels (m) in the space time considered ref. [3,4].

in black hole backgrounds (bh), (m) is the same as in at space time ref. [5] and the string
critical temperature is the usual (hagedorn) temperature in at space time. in de sitter (ds) as well
as in anti de sitter (ads) backgrounds (including the corresponding conformal invariant wzwn
sl(2,r) models) (m) are dierent from at space time ref. [3,6,7,8,9]. there is a critical (maximal)
string temperature in de sitter background, while in ads there is no nite maximal string tempera-
ture at all ref. [6,7,9] ( the maximal temperature is formally innite, as the partition function for
a gas of strings in ads is dened for any external temperature ref. [6]).

we dene a r dual transformation over a length l, as following

l = rl = lr l1

(1)

where lr has dimensions of (length)2.

for physical theories, r maps classical length scales lcl into quantum string length scales lq,

and conversely

and

lcl  rlcl = lr l1

cl = lq

lq  rlq = lr l1

q = lcl

(2)

(3)

lr depends on the dimensional parameters of the theory and on the string constant  (and on h,
c as well). the r transform, as we will show here, is not an assumed or a priori imposed symmetry,
but it is a transformation revealed from the qft and st dynamics in curved backgrounds.

lcl sets up a length scale for the semiclassical - qft regime and lq is the length that characterizes
the string domain; lq depends on the dimensional string constant  ( = c2/2t , where t is the
string tension) and on the specic background considered.

2

the vehicle of the r-transformation is the dimensional constant  introduced by st, which
is essential here. the r-operation transforms the characteristic lengths of one regime (qft or st)
into the characteristic lengths of the other, and thus relate dierent physical regimes in the same
curved space time.

the r-transformation belongs to the class of relativistic quantum type of operations l  l1,
which appear in st due to the existence of the dimensional string constant .
(let us recall
that the t-duality, widely studied in st ref.
c , but where r1 and r2
are compactication radii. such a t-duality links physically equivalent string theories). as st
should contain qft in the limit   0, our study supports the idea of considering this type of
transformations as fundamental symmetries for the full string theory.

[12], is e.g. r1r2 = h

qft in curved backgrounds with event horizons posseses an intrinsic (hawking-gibbons) tem-
[1,10,11], which can be expressed, in general, as a function t of lcl (and of the

perature th ref.
constants h, c and kb)

th = t (lcl)

(4)

quantum strings in minkowski space time have an intrinsic (hagedorn) temperature. quantum
[2,3,6], which de-

strings in curved backgrounds have also an intrinsic string temperature ts ref.
pends on lq

ts = t (lq)

(5)

explicit calculations for de sitter (ds) and schwarzschild black hole (bh) show that t is formally
the same function for both qft and qs temperatures ([eq. (4)] and [eq. (5)]), ref. [3,4].

it is worth to point out that space times without event horizons  such as anti de sitter (ads)
space  have neither th nor ts temperatures, independently of how much quantum matter is present.
in fact, in pure ads space, th is zero and ts is formally innite ref. [6,9].

applying the r operation ([eq. (2)] to [eq. (4)]) and [eq. (5)], we read

th = ts

, ts = th

(6)

that is, th and ts are mapped one into the other. from the above equations, we can also write

th ts = tsth

3

(7)

which is a weaker r-relation between th and ts.

let us analyse the mass domains in the corresponding qft and qs regimes in a curved space
time. they will be limited by the corresponding mass scales mh and mqs. mh depends on the
classical length lcl

and mqs on the quantum length lq, through the same formal relation as we shall see

mh = m(lcl)

therefore, under the r operation [eq. (2)] the mass scales satisfy:

mqs = m(lq)

mh = mqs

, mqs = mh

(8)

(9)

(10)

on the other hand, if mqf t is the mass of a test particle in the qft regime and ms the mass
of a particle state in the quantum string spectrum, the mapping of the qft mass domain d on the
qs domain  and viceversa  will read

r (d(mqf t , mh)) = d(ms, mqs)

(11)

summarizing: the qft regime  characterized by lcl, th and mh  and the qs regime  char-
acterized by lq , ts and mqs  , both in a curved space time, are mapped one into another under
the r-transform.

we illustrate this with two relevant examples: de sitter (ds) and black hole (bh) space times.

1. qft and qs in de sitter space time

the classical lcl, or horizon radius, is

lcl = ch 1

4

(12)

where h is the hubble constant. the mass scale mh is such that lcl is its compton wave length

mh =

h
clcl

=

hh
c2

,

and the qft hawking-gibbons temperature is

th =

h

2kbc



here  is the surface gravity. for ds space time  = ch, and th reads

th =

hh
2kb

=

hc

2kb (cid:18) 1
lcl(cid:19)

(13)

(14)

(15)

on the other hand, canonical as well as semiclassical quantization of quantum strings in ds space
time ref. [6,7,8] lead to the existence of a maximum mass mmax for the quantum string (oscillating
or stable) particle spectrum. we identify this maximal mass with the string mass scale mqs

mqs  mmax  c(h)1

(16)

the fact that there is a maximal mass mqs implies the existence of a (minimal) quantum string

scale lq, which is the corresponding compton wave length

lq =

hh
c2 =

h

cmqs

,

(17)

and of a maximum (or critical) temperature ts

ts =

hc

2kb   1

lq! =

c3

2kbh

(18)

notice that lq, ts and mqs depend on the string tension and on h while lr [eq. (3)] does only

on :

lr = hc1  l2
s

(19)

ls is a pure string scale.

from the above equations it is clear that the r-transform maps the set (lcl, th and mh ) into

the other set (lq, ts and mqs), satisfying the duality relations [eqs. (2,6 and 10)].

we consider now the mass domains in the two regimes. in the qft regime the mass mqf t of
a quantum test particle satises mqf t < mh. in the qs regime, the mass ms, of a particle state
from the quantum string spectrum satises ms < mqs. these conditions can be expressed in terms
of lengths as qf t /lcl > 1 and s/lq > 1, where qf t and s are the compton wave lengths
corresponding to mqf t and ms respectively. the r operation then maps the qft domain into the
qs domain [eq. (11)]

r (cid:18)mqf t

mh (cid:19) =

ms
mqs

< 1

(20)

on the other hand, string quantization in ds space time requires lq to be much smaller than the

universe radius i.e lq/lcl  1. as a consequence, mh and mqs obey the inequality mqs  mh.

if back reaction eect of the quantum matter is considered, r-relations between the qft and
st regimes manifest as well. we studied quantum string back reaction due to the higher excited
modes in the framework of the string analogue model. two branches r (i.e. h) of solutions for
the scalar curvature show up ref. [3]:

(a) a high curvature solution r+ with a maximal value rmax = (9c42/4g)(6/(5ch3))1/2, entirely
sustained by the strings. this branch corresponds to the string phase for the background,
whose temperature is given by the intrinsic string temperature

ts  t+ =

c3

2kbh+



(21)

(b) a low curvature solution r whose leading term in r/rmax expansion is the classical curvature.
this branch corresponds to the semi-classical-qft phase of the background geometry, whose
temperature is given by the hawking-gibbons temperature

th  t =

hh
2kb

(22)

from [eq. (21)] and [eq. (22)], we see that the r-relations manifest as well when back reaction is
included.

the qft hawking temperature is

th =

hc(d  3)

4kb

(cid:18) 1
rh(cid:19)

(23)

(24)

( = (d  3)c2/2rh).

in the qft regime, a bh does emit thermal radiation at a temperature th ref. [10]. in the qs
regime, the bh has a high massive quantum thermal emission, corresponding to the higher excited
quantum string states. for open strings (in the asymptotically at bh region), the thermodynamical
behaviour of these states is deduced from the string canonical partition function ref.
[4]. in bh
space times, the mass spectrum of quantum string states coincides with the one in minkowski space,
and critical dimensions are the same as well, ref. [5]. therefore, the asymptotic string mass density
of levels, in bh space times, reads (m)  exp{b(c/h)1/2m} , and quantum strings have an intrinsic
temperature ts which is the same as in at space time. the string canonical partition function is
dened for hawking temperatures th satisfying the condition ref. [4]

th < ts =

hc

bkbls

(25)

i.e in string theory, th has an upper limit given by the intrinsic or critical string temperature ts.
this limit implies the existence of a minimal bh radius rmin, and a minimal bh mass mmin

and

rh > rmin =

d = 4 .

therefore, the qs scales are lq = rmin , mqs = mmin , and the string temperature ts. they
depend on the type of strings and on the dimension through the parameter b. in terms of rmin, ts
and mmin read

hc(d3)

from [eqs.
transformed of each other. this is valid in all dimensions.

(23,24)] and [eqs.

(28,29)], we see that (rh , mh, th) and (rmin, mmin, ts) are r-

we discuss now the mass domain relation [eq. (11)] in the bh case. the qft domain reads
qf t /rh < 1, and the qs domain s/rmin < 1. in terms of the masses involved ( d = 4, for simplic-
ity), these conditions yield to m 2
p l(mminms)1 < 1 , (mp l = (hc/g)1/2).
both mass conditions can be expressed as hmqf t c2 > 1 and smsc2 > 1, where  = (kbt )1 being
t the bh temperature in each regime. this is precisely the condition for dening the asymptotic
expression for the string canonical partition function ref.[4].

p l(mh mqf t )1 < 1 and m 2

the physical meaning behind these r-relations is the following. at the rst stages of bh evap-
oration, emission is in the lighter particle masses at the hawking temperature th , as described by
the semiclassical - qft regime. as evaporation proceeds, temperature increases and high massive
emission corresponds to the higher excited string modes. at the later stages, for th  ts (i.e
rh  rmin , mh  mmin), the bh enters its qs regime. the r transformation allows to link the
early (th  ts, i.e rh  rmin, mh  mmin) and late (th  ts , i.e rh  rmin , mh  mmin)
stages of bh evaporation.

these r-relations manifest as well if the back reaction eect of higher massive string modes is
included ref. [4]. the string back reaction solution (r+, m+, t+) shows that the bh radius r+ and
mass m+ decrease and the bh temperature t+ increases. here r+ is bounded from below (by rmin)
and t+ does not blow up (ts is the maximal value). the string back reaction eect is nite and
consistently describes both the qft (th  ts) and the qs (th  ts) regimes. it has the bounds:
(r, t, m)min < (r, t, m)+ < (r, t, m)h . the two bounds are linked by the r transform.

8

summarizing, from the above bh and ds studies, the hawking-gibbons temperature of the qft

regime becomes the intrinsic string temperature of the string regime.
also, in the ads background, the r-transformation manifests as well between th and ts.

these bh and ds examples suggest that our r transform could be promoted to a dynamical oper-
ation: evolution from a semiclassical - qft phase to a quantum string phase (as in bh evaporation)
or conversely (cosmological evolution).
