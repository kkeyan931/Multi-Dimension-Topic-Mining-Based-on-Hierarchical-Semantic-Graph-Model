abstract

we argue that a description of supersymmetric extended objects from a unied geometric point
of view requires an enlargement of superspace. to this aim we study in a systematic way how
superspace groups and algebras arise from grassmann spinors when these are assumed to be the
only primary entities. in the process, we recover generalized spacetime superalgebras and extensions
of supersymmetry found earlier. the enlargement of ordinary superspace with new parameters gives
rise to extended superspace groups, on which manifestly supersymmetric actions may be constructed
for various types of p-branes, including d-branes (given by chevalley-eilenberg cocycles) with their
born-infeld elds. this results in a eld/extended superspace democracy for superbranes: all brane
elds appear as pull-backs from a suitable target superspace. our approach also claries some facts
concerning the origin of the central charges for the dierent p-branes.

introduction

as is well known, the existence of consistent classical actions for extended supersymmetric objects of
spatial dimension p is restricted to certain dimensions d of spacetime. this is e.g. the case of the
p-branes of the minimal or old branescan [1], which restricts the actions to certain values (d, p) for
which there exists a wess-zumino (wz) term. this is needed for the -symmetry of the full action that
matches the physical bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom on the worldvolume w , and the wz
term is given by a closed (p + 2)-form which can be interpreted [2] as a chevalley-eilenberg [3] (ce)
(p + 2)-cocycle on superspace. the rst classication of p-branes [1] was restricted to elds forming
a scalar supermultiplet on w , consisting of scalars and spinors after gauging the -symmetry. the
restriction to superspace coordinates x,  on w was later removed with the addition of higher spin
elds, vectors or antisymmetric tensors, forming vector or antisymmetric tensor supermultiplets on
w . this, together with the bose-fermi matching conditions led to an enlargement of the possibilities
(see [4, 5] and earlier references therein) for the classically allowed supermembranes. recently, p-
branes including an abelian vector gauge eld on w have been interpreted as (dirichlet) d-branes
[6] (see [7] for a review). their kinetic term is described by a born-infeld type lagrangian which
replaces the usual nambu-goto one to accommodate the vector potential; in similarity with the p-
branes in [1], there also exists a -symmetric worldvolume action [8] for them. the introduction of
other objects such as l-branes (which have linear supermultiplets on w ) [9] etc., have enlarged the
number and types of p-branes. finally, the emergence of a web of dualities among the ve consistent
10-dimensional string theories, all presumably subsumed, together with d = 11 supergravity, in the
eleven dimensional m -theory (see, e.g. [10]) has led to the second superstring revolution and to a
change of the conventional views of supersymmetry. one version of the m -theory, m -atrix theory
[11], even reinterprets spacetime coordinates as non-commuting matrices.

the existence of various extended objects for which there is no unied description suggests that,
in the same way minkowski space was enlarged to the superspace  to treat bosons and fermions
simultaneously, it may be necessary to extend  further to accommodate in a unied point of view a
number of the physical aspects mentioned above. in particular, one might hope to remove the need of
dening elds directly on w if an extended superspace  is introduced, as it will be seen to be the case.

this extension of  is tantamount to enlarging the d-dimensional superpoincare sp to fsp and to
dening the extended superspace  by the quotient fsp /spin(1, d1). endowing  with a supergroup

structure means that there must exist new superalgebras going beyond the ordinary supersymmetry
algebra, and several of them have been discussed in various contexts [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22]. our point of view, however, will be to assume that fermions (in the form of odd abelian
spinor translations) are the only basic (i.e., initial) entities. we shall then look for the most general
superspace groups that are allowed by group extension theory and discuss their consequences for a
unied picture of superbranes. we nd this path rather natural, but it is not the only one. another
possibility is to take the worldvolume supersymmetry of the p-branes into account by elevating the
target superspace coordinates to worldvolume superelds [23, 24] (see also [9] and references therein),
but we shall not follow this superembedding or double supersymmetry approach.

stated as above, the problem is rst a mathematical one. much in the same way that rigid super-
space is itself a group extension, and hence supersymmetry is the result of the non-trivial cohomology
of a certain odd superstranslation group strd [25, 26], it is worth looking for all the possible group
extensions of the various strd (i.e., strd= {n =1, str11, str10, iia, iib, etc}) to explore their role
in more general theories. at the algebra level, the possible supersymmetry algebras were already in-
vestigated in [27] and, allowing tensor central charges, in [28] (tensorial charges were also considered
in [29, 30, 31]). but there is also a physical reason behind the mathematical extension problem. it
is known that the quasi-invariance of a lagrangian under a symmetry indicates that the (second)
cohomology group is non-trivial, and that the symmetry group may hence be extended.1 this was
exploited in [12] to extend the supersymmetry algebra for the supersymmetric extended objects by
topological charges. for lagrangians containing a quasi-invariant piece (b) constructed from a form
b on a group  by pulling it back to a manifold w by , where  : w  , the extension may allow
us, as it is the case with the wz terms b of supersymmetric objects, to obtain manifestly invariant

1 for a detailed account of quasi-invariance, noether currents, cohomology and extensions, see [26, 32].

terms b 2 by dening them on an extended group manifold . in fact, it was shown in [16] that to
every free dierential algebra in [2] corresponds a new spacetime superalgebra, from which invariant
forms can be found to dene new wz terms 3. we shall take the analysis of [16, 2, 19] further (see
also [18]) by considering various superbrane types and by emphasizing the supergroup manifold point
of view. thus, we shall look for and introduce extended superspace groups  in a systematic way
(we restrict our attention here to rigid superspaces). the additional variables in these will determine
symmetries to which (topological) charges may correspond via the standard noether theorem. for
the branes of the old branescan, these new variables will appear only in the wz term and as a total
dierential. this will be dierent for the d-branes, for which we will obtain, nevertheless, that it
is also possible to nd an action dened on an extended superspace (thus removing the necessity of
introducing directly worldvolume elds) with a wz term given by a ce (p + 2)-cocycle. by show-
ing that all these structures and extended superspaces  follow from a basic odd translation group
strd dened by the grassmann spinors of the specic theory, we may conclude that the s (and

the corresponding extended superpoincare groups fsp ) are in a way as fundamental as the standard

one, and necessary for a proper description of the physics involved around m -theory and its six weak
coupling limit corners. the new variables may be relevant in the search for superbrane actions, in the
description of dualities or in the quantisation process.

this paper is organised as follows. sec. 2 contains all central extensions of strd, including ordinary
superspace, for various dimensions, and its results are summarised in a table. sec. 3 considers in
general the inclusion of additional non-central generators. sec. 4 is devoted to the structure of the
new superspaces  and provides a compact expression for the contribution to the noether charges
coming from the wz terms of the various possible actions, once they are formulated on . sec.
5 shows how the simplest d = 10, 11 extended superspaces are relevant to construct a manifestly
invariant wz term, both for the green-schwarz superstring [33, 13] (which we will complete with an
additional contribution), and for the supermembrane. we shall recover there the results of [16] and
compute the topological charges which, in our approach, correspond to the new group variables. the
question of the linearity of the group action is seen in sec. 5.1 to be associated with a coboundary
election. sections 6 and 8 show how the case of the iia dp-branes and m 5-brane may also be treated
within the same framework i.e., how branes containing vector and tensor elds on w may be dened
directly on suitably extended superspaces. we shall argue, in fact, that the picture is general and that
suitable target superspaces exist on which to dene all the elds appearing in the p-brane actions,
including the various vector (see also [22]), tensor, etc. worldvolume elds. this is tantamount to
establishing a general elds/extended superspace democracy in which the worldvolume elds and the
extended superspace variables are on the same footing, as it was already the case for the minimal
branescan. indeed this correspondence between coordinates and elds has occasionally been discussed
in the past in other contexts (see [34, 35, 36, 37]). sec. 7 contains a brief discussion of the origin of the
contributions to the noether charges in the d-branes case [38] in our approach. finally, an appendix
complements the general theory of non-central extensions of superspace in sec. 3 and gives the proof
of some needed -matrix identities.

2 central extensions and their superspaces

2.1 standard superspace as a central extension

its components  (2[d/2]
let  be an arbitrary grassmann spinor in a d-dimensional spacetime.
where [d/2] denotes the integer part of d/2, or 2(d/2)1 in the weyl case) determine an abelian
group of supertranslations, generically denoted strd, with group composition law

 =  + 

.

(2.1)

2this is not always possible. when the group g is simple, the extension appears only at the loop algebra (of charge
densities) level, as for the su(2) kac-moody algebra for a wzw model, and disappears for the algebra of charges, as
required by whiteheads lemma.

3although it may be argued that these invariant terms should no longer be called wz terms, we shall retain this

name for them.

when the lorentz part is considered explicitly, there is an action  of spin(1, d  1) on strd and
the relevant group becomes strd  spin(1, d  1), where  indicates semidirect product. then (2.1)
is replaced by
(2.2)
where a  spin(1, d  1) and (a) is the appropriate spin representation. the spinor  is often
restricted to be of some specic type, usually minimal (e.g., majorana (m), weyl (w) or majorana-
weyl (mw), when possible); it may carry an additional index i = 1, . . . , n if there is more than one
supersymmetry. associated with (2.1) is the abelian lie superalgebra {d, d} = 0 4, which can also
be described in terms of the left-invariant (li) one-forms  = d and the trivial maurer-cartan
(mc) equation

 =  + (a)

a = aa ,

,

(2.3)
extending strd by the minkowski translations x ,  = 0, . . . , d  1 leads to standard (rigid) super-
space [25, 26]. let us adopt the free dierential algebra (fda)5 point of view to discuss the extension
problem, since forms are especially convenient in the construction of actions for extended objects.

d = 0 .

let  be majorana, and consider the two-form (c)   on strd. it denes a non trivial
ce two-cocycle on the superalgebra of strd, i.e. it is left-invariant (li), closed and not given by the
dierential of a li one-form. since by construction the two-cocycle transforms as a lorentz vector, it
is consistent to extend the fda (2.3) by a one-form  such that

d =

1
2

(c)

(2.4)

(we omit the wedge product henceforth). the above extension immediately implies {d, d} =
(c)x, with x central. one still has to relate the newly introduced one-form to the coordinate
x. we dene

(2.5)

(2.6)

 = dx +

(c)d

1
2

and choose the transformation law for x so that  is li

x = x + x 

1
2

(c)

.

this gives rigid superspace , parametrized by (, x) and with group law given by (2.1) and (2.6).
the above simple example exhibits already the key features of the extension algorithm. given a
particular fda to be extended, one identies in general a non-trivial two-cocycle of a desired lorentz
covariant nature and introduces a new li one-form, the dierential of which is given by the cocycle.
the new form (here, (2.5)) together with the mc equations (here, eqns. (2.3) and (2.4)) automatically
dene by duality an extended lie algebra. the new li one-form is given by the sum of the dierential
of the new group parameter and the potential one-form of the ce two-cocycle on strd, which is not
li. finally, the transformation properties of the new coordinate are xed so as to guarantee the left
invariance of the new one-form, while those of the original manifold are unmodied. the additional
one-form can be made li only if it is dened on the extended superspace manifold . the new (central)
generator, associated with translations along the new coordinates, modies the r.h.s. of the original
commutators of the algebra. since adding (2.4) to (2.3) involves a central extension, we could have
introduced a dimensionful constant6 as a factor in the r.h.s. of (2.4). by not doing so, the dimensions
of  are xed to be []2 = []2. we shall, as usual, take [] = l

2 so that [] = l.

4 since we shall be considering left-invariant (li) generators and forms, we shall use here ds (rather than qs) to
denote the generators of the right translations (the qs being realized as the right-invariant (ri) generators of the left
translations). this distinction is of course irrelevant for an abelian group such as (2.1) but it is not so when non-abelian
parts are added (nevertheless, the corresponding structure constants dier only in a sign). furthermore, li and ri
generators commute, {q, d} = 0. we may look at the ds as covariant derivatives and at the qs as the generators of
the (left) supersymmetry transformations; see sec. 4.

5the term refers to an algebra generated by dierential forms which is closed under the action of d [39]. for early

physical applications of fda in supersymmetry see [40, 41] and references therein.

6 the value of this constant determines the specic element in cohomology space that characterizes the central

extension.

if we add the lorentz group, the result must reect the action  of spin(1, d 1) on the extension
cocyle (see, e.g. [26], sec. 5.3), but we shall not consider explicitly the eect of the simple part of the
algebra which, apart from extracting the various tensor-valued second cohomology groups from that
of the trivial (=0) action h 2
0 (strd) (see below), plays no essential role in our discussion once only
lorentz covariant objects are used. thus, central means, where appropriate, central up to lorentz
transformations.

the extension procedure described above can be applied more than once there are two basic
patterns one may follow in this case. one can start in each step with the same original manifold strd,
and keep adding two-cocycles and central generators or, in each step, one can consider the result of
the previous extension as the starting manifold. in the rst case (sec. 2.2) all new generators remain
in the second case,
central and appear only at the r.h.s. of the original {d, d} anticommutator.
a richer structure emerges since the generators introduced at each step can, in principle, modify all
previous commutators. we shall give the details of this second construction in sec. 3.

2.2 maximal central extensions of superspace

let  be majorana. we may obtain additional lorentz tensors, leading to new central charges, by
considering

(c1...p) ,

(1...p = [12  p] 

1
p!

1...p
1...p 1 . . . p) ,

(2.7)

where7 cc 1 = t . the antisymmetry in the lorentz indices is needed to rule out trivial
dependences coming from the fact that {, } = 2 . the left invariance of the new forms in (2.7)
requires new group parameters 1...p so that (cf. (2.5))

1...p = d1...p +

1
2

(c1...p)

.

(2.8)

the superalgebra generator (li vector eld) z1...p, corresponding to 1...p, is realized by z1...p =
/1...p on the extended group manifold.

at this stage there are no restrictions coming from the jacobi identity, equivalent to d(d1...p) =
0, which follows trivially from d = 0. this is an alternative way of stating that the p-tensor-valued
mapping on strd  strd,

1...p(, ) = (c1...p)

,

(2.9)

satises trivially the two-cocycle condition

(, ) + ( + , ) = (,  + ) + (, ) .

(2.10)

the symmetry of (c1...p) is needed to prevent the two-cocycle (2.9) from being trivial (i.e., a
two-coboundary), since ()= (c1...p) on strd, which might generate  through cob(, ) 
( + )  ()  (), is identically zero. thus, (2.9) denes a non-trivial extension. for a given
spacetime dimension d, the symmetry condition restricts the rank of the tensors that are allowed in
(2.7). hence, the problem of nding all central extensions of the algebra {d, d} = 0 (or of the
lie fda (2.3)) is reduced to nding a basis of the symmetric space (  ) in terms of tensors
(c1...p) symmetric in , ; they dene the lie algebra ce two-cocycles (c1...p).
p=0(cid:0)d
p(cid:1),
when d is even, the space of matrices with indices () is 2d-dimensional. since 2d =pd
a basis for this space is provided by the (2d  1) matrices given by the lorentz tensors 1...p of
rank 1  p  d plus the unit matrix. for d odd, the spinors have dimension 2(d1)/2 and, since
(cid:0)d
p(cid:1), a basis is provided by the (2d1  1) matrices given by the tensors 1...p of
2d1 =p(d1)/2
rank 1  p  (d  1)/2 plus the unit matrix. the dierence is a consequence of the fact that, for any
d,
(2.11)

p=0

,

1...pd+1  1...d p+1...d

7we adopt c  c for simplicity. by not considering c+c 1

+ = t we rule out, e.g., the pseudomajorana spinors

that exist for d = 8, 9 [mod 8] (see [42]).

where d+1 is the chirality matrix. for d odd, d+1  1, and only the tensors of rank 0  p 
(d  1)/2 are linearly independent.

for d even, c1...p satises (see e.g., [43])

(c1...p) = (1)(p1)(p2)/2(c1...p)t

thus, =1 (1) for d=2, 4 (6, 8) [mod 8] so that (c1...p) is symmetric for p= 1, 2 [mod 4] if
d = 2, 4 [mod 8] and for p = 3, 4 if d = 6, 8 [mod 8]. for d odd, it turns out that the same condition,
(1)(p1)(p2)/2=1, holds for d=3 [mod 4] with  = 
d. we have excluded here (somewhat
arbitrarily) the d=5, 9 cases because in these dimensions no c such that cc 1 = t exists.
(strdspin(1, d1)) for various strd groups is given in the
table. as a two-form, the various ce twococycles are given by d(c1...p)d. the corresponding
new generators z1...p are all central, as is x itself. they are on the same footing and may thought
of as generalised momenta. each of the resulting extensions denes an extended superspace group;
we will denote them generically by .

the table also includes the cases in which the spinor is majorana-weyl or complex (dirac and
weyl). if the spinor is complex the independent tensors 01...p may appear. the eect of consid-
ering weyl spinors is taken into account by introducing a chiral projector (p+, say).
the dierent extended supersymmetry algebras can be easily found from the results in the table.
we shall only give below two examples which contain formulae that will be explicitly used later on. to
avoid cumbersome factorials, we use a normalization of the generators which is tantamount to dening
the duality relations by 1...p(z1...p) = 1

1...p so that 1...p(c1...pz1...p) = c1...p.

2.3 applications

2.3.1 n=1 theory extended superspace

for d even, the basic spinors in (2.1) may be reduced to 2d/21-dimensional weyl spinors, and
the discussion of the possible h 2
(strd  spin(1, d  1)) spaces must take this into account. let
d = 2 [mod 8] and let  be mw. the symmetry of (c1...pp) is now achieved if both c1...p
and c1...pd+1 (or, on account of (2.11), c1...dp) are symmetric . hence, there are central
charges for d = 2, p = 1 and d = 10, p = 1, 5, 9 (i.e., p=1 [mod 4]). as a result, the d=10, n=1
extended superspace algebra has the form

.

 , d+

{d+

1...5 where z +

1...5 is a self-dual 5-tensor [28], z +

 } = (cp+)x + (c1...5p+)z1...5 + (c1...9p+)z1...9

(2.13)
due to p+ and to (2.11), the rst and last term in the r.h.s may be grouped into a single one,
(cp+)(x + z); classically, z may be absorbed by redening x and the previous analysis shows
that the vectorvalued cohomology space is onedimensional. the second term may be rewritten as
6...10z6...10 ),
(c1...5)z +
with half the number of components of z1...5. as a result, the degrees of freedom in eqn. (2.13)

2(cid:1) + 16 = 136 = 10 + 1
2(cid:0)10
5(cid:1) (see table). but in general z cannot be reabsorbed, since the

green-schwarz action for the heterotic superstring produces such a contribution to the algebra [12],
of an origin dierent from that of x. mathematically, this corresponds to the fact that the group
parameters are dierent for x (translations x) and z (); they are locally equivalent, much in
the same way r  s1 locally, but they are dierent globally. we may, however, achieve the symmetry
under the exchange of x9 and z9 (say) when the 9-direction is a circle of radius r. then the spectra
of x9 and z9 are isomorphic under the t-duality exchange r  1/r (see [45, 46]).

some lie algebra second cohomology groups for strd (minimal spinors are in boldface). n is the complex dimension of a dirac spinor, equal to the real dimension of
majorana spinors for d = 2, 3, 4 [mod 8]. the fourth column gives the dimension of the spinor indicated. the fth and sixth column give the ranks for which (c1...p )
(or (c1 ...pp+)) are symmetric (as deduced from (2.12)) and the dimension of these lorentz tensors; c itself is symmetric in d = 6, 7, 8 [mod 8]. the seventh and
eigth columns do the same for the additional tensors (01...p) (01...pp+) appearing in the complex spinor case. these hermitian (adding i when needed) tensors
are limited by duality (eqn. (2.11)) in the odd (d = 7) case and to odd rank by the presence of p+ in the weyl case. the 1
2 indicates halving due to self-duality. the
number of real cohomology groups h 2
(strd  spin(1, d  1)) is given by the rst number in the last column. these spaces are the relevant (i.e.tensorial) ones, once the
lorentz symmetry is considered since in this case strd  spin(1, d  1) (rather than strd) is the group to be extended. the action  of spin(1, d  1) on the extension
cocycles is automatically taken into account by using only lorentz covariant objects for them. the bracketed number in the last column ignores the lorentz part and,
as a result, dim h 2
nevertheless since it serves as a check on the degrees of freedom: it is equal to the sum of the total real dimensions in the sixth and eigth columns.

2(cid:1) + n since the elements of strd are odd (for an ordinary n-dimensional abelian group dim h 2

2(cid:1) + n is given

if z is included separately, this introduces a further extension which requires adding a new li form
associated with it, ()
2 (cp+)dd (we have written the index down for consistency
with later notation, as in sec. 5.1). at the group level this means that the mw translations generate
two types of transformations i.e., one has to distinguish between the translations x and the , some
of which may be compact, in which case the corresponding group law expression should be understood
locally.

iia theory centrally extended superspace

let us consider now the h 2
(str10  spin(1, 9), (iia)) spaces. the iia superalgebra is the d = 10
algebra associated with two 16-dimensional spinors of opposite chiralities which may be combined into
a majorana spinor. then (see table), the iia theory maximally extended algebra [28] is found to be

{d, d} = (c)x + (c12)z12 + (c1...5)z1...5

+ (c11)z + (c11)z + (c1...411)z1...4

,

(2.16)

since the tensor spaces {1...p} and {1...dp11} are isomorphic by eqn. (2.11). notice that x
and z belong to dierent cohomology classes (their corresponding two-cocycles are not cohomologous
due to the presence of 11 in the z term). the associated iia lie fda, involving the li one-forms
dual to the generators in (2.16), is given by

d = 1
d1...5 = 1
d= 1

2 (c) ,
2 (c1...5) ,
2 (c11) .

(z) = 1

2 (c11)

d =0 ,
d12 = 1
d1...4 = 1

2 (c12) ,
2 (c1...411) ,

(2.17)
the new group parameters dene the iia theory centrally extended superspace, parametrized by the
coordinates (, x, , 12, 1...5, 1...4, ).

the iib case with  i  p+d i (i = 1, 2) is treated similarly by noticing that the presence of ij

allows for c123p+, which is skew-symmetric.

3 non-central extensions and their superspaces

we start now from standard rigid superspace, eqns. (2.3), (2.4) for real, odd translations. to keep the
discussion as general as possible, we rescale , 1...p by an arbitrary dimensionless constant as, so
that (2.4), (2.7) become

d = as(c)

,

d1...p  a0(c1...p)

.

(3.1)

let us x p and consider the resulting extended superspace, parametrized by (, x, 1...p),
as our starting group manifold. we look for a non-trivial ce two-cocycle with p indices on the
above extended superspace. this may now involve any of the li forms available, ,  or 1...p.
inspection of the possible lorentz tensors shows that the external lorentz indices of this two-cocycle
have to be of the type (1 . . . p11) and, hence, the only available li two-forms are

(1)
1...p11 = (c1...p1)1 

,

(2)
1...p11 = (c)11...p1

.

(3.2)

for p = 1, both are closed. for p  2, d((1) + 2(2)) = 0 gives 2 =
(c)(c1...p1)  = 0 ,

as
a0

provided8

(3.3)

which holds only for certain values of (d, p) [1] (for p = 1, d = 3, 4, 10 and, with the appropriate
modications for complex spinors, d = 6). the existence of such a constraint, on both d and p,

8 primed indices are understood to be symmetrised (with unit weight).

is a new featurethe non-triviality of (2.9) only restricted p. we introduce now a new oneform
1...p11 with

d1...p11 = a1(cid:18)(c1...p1)1  +

as
a0

(c)11...p1)(cid:19)

(3.4)

(for p = 1 the coecient of the second term can be arbitrary, see sec. 5.1).9 the above mc equation
implies that both [d, x] and [d, z 1...p] are modied by a term proportional to z 1...p11, the
latter being the only central generator at this stage (z 1...p11 is central because, by construction,
1...p11 cannot appear at the r.h.s. of a mc equation expressing the dierential of a li form). this
is a general feature of the extension scheme in this section: at any stage in the chain of extensions,
the only central generator present is the last one introduced. thus, each extension is central, but the
resulting algebra/group is not a central extension of superspace: all generators but the last one have
non-zero commutators as a consequence of the subsequent extensions. a second feature here is that
successive extensions substitute one spinorial index for a vectorial one, preserving the total number of
indices. the chain ends with the introduction of a generator with p spinorial indices.

repeating the above procedure, one nds that the next three extensions are in some sense excep-
tional (see (3.5) below), while the one introducing ve spinorial indices and all others after it follow
a pattern which can be used to derive a recursion formula. skipping the somewhat involved algebra
(see appendix a), we list rst the results for the next three extensions

notice that the above recursion starts at k = 3, which implies p  5. on the other hand, the maximum
value of p (of interest to us) for which (3.3) holds true is p = 5, i.e. (3.6) is relevant here only for

is non-zero). in general, we will not raise or lower the lorentz indices of forms, their position being used to distinguish
between dierent types of them as in [19].

4 structure of the new superspaces and noether currents

4.1 fibre bundle structure

all extended superspaces have a natural bundle structure, in which the basis is the group to be
extended and the bre is the group by which we extend. for instance, superspace  itself and the
various extensions  in sec. 2.2 may be considered as the total spaces of principal bundles over the
strds of the specic theory. the two-forms which dene the extensions are curvatures of invariant
connections valued on the central algebras by which strd is extended. the ds are then the horizontal

 on the specic base manifold strd; this justies the covariant derivative
lifts of the vector elds
name which may be given to the ds in the algebra of the s. similar considerations apply at any
step in the chain of extensions in sec. 3. from this point of view, after the last step, one has a bundle
structure with the last coordinate in the bre and all the rest in the base. as we show below, there is
also another relevant bundle structure with  in the base and all new coordinates in the bre.

let us now discuss the general case treated in sec. 3.

 is parametrised by the coordinates
(, x, 1...p, 1...p11, . . . , 1...p). we will denote them collectively by the row vector  =
(za, a) where z parametrizes the base (superspace ) and  the bre (the space of all new coordi-
nates). referring to this block form, we will say that the superspace part is twodimensional while
the bre part has dimension p + 1. the li oneforms that reduce to the dierentials of these coor-
dinates at the identity will be denoted by  = (h a , a) and the dual li vector elds by the column
vector z = (da , y a)t (t denotes matrix transposition). the corresponding ri objects will carry an
additional hat.

under a right group transformation, g  gg, z transforms like z  t tz, t  being a matrix of

(primed) functions on the group, called the adjoint representation. it holds

t  = t t ,

z  t|e = adj(z)

,

(4.1)

adj(z) being the adjoint representation of z, given by the structure constants.
inspection of the
mc equations then reveals that t is a lower triangular matrix with units along the diagonal. we put
accordingly

(4.2)

t t =(cid:18) a c

0 b (cid:19) ,

(t t)1 =(cid:18) a1 a1cb1

b1

0

(cid:19)

with a, b upper triangular matrices. the dimensions of a, b, c (in block form) are 2  2, (p + 1) 
(p + 1), 2  (p + 1) respectively. (4.2) shows that the bre is a subgroup, with adjoint representation
given by bt. in this notation, the li vector elds transform like

(cid:19) .
the li forms similarly transform according to   (t t)1, i.e.

(cid:18) d
y (cid:19) (cid:18) a d + c  y

b  y

( h ,  )  ( h a1 , h a1c b 1 +  b 1 )

.

for the ri objects it holds z = (t t)1 z,  =  t t i.e.

(4.3)

(4.4)

(cid:18) d
y (cid:19) =(cid:18) a1 d  a1cb1 y

b1 y

(cid:19) ,

( h ,

 ) = ( h a , h c +  b )

.

(4.5)

the lie algebra valued oneform  =  y serves as a connection in the bundle. indeed, one easily
veries that  is invariant under (4.3), (4.4) when t is restricted to the subgroup of the bre (a = i,
c = 0). the horizontal subspace is spanned by the kernel of , i.e. by the components of d, the
latter being the horizontal lifts of the standard superspace generators d(s)
x +

2 (c) 

in later applications, in section 5, the explicit form of the matrix b1 is needed  we present here
a few remarks that facilitate its computation. inspection of the r.h.s. of the mc equations for the new
oneforms, in section 3, shows that they always contain one new oneform, multiplied by a  or .

 , x (s)

 = 

 = 

 .

for the dual lie algebra this implies that the new generators commute among themselves and only
have, in general, nonzero commutators with the superspace generators d, x. in other words, the
group by which we extend  is abelian (to begin with) and its generators acquire, as a result of the
extension, nonzero commutators only with the superspace generators. the structure of the resulting
lie algebra is, in symbolic form,

[d, y ]  y
in the notation introduced earlier. for t , the expression

[d, d]  d + y

,

,

[y, y ] = 0 ,

t = ea adj(za)  eza adj(da)+a adj(y a)

(4.6)

(4.7)

is well known. from the third of (4.6) though, we infer that the restriction of adj (y ) to the bre (i.e.
to the sub-block corresponding to bt) is zero. denoting this sub-block by (f )

adj (y ) we nd for b

b = eza (f )

adj (da)t

adj (d)t+x (f )

adj (x)t

 e (f )

,

(4.8)

where the matrices (f )
adj (da) are given by the structure constants that appear in (the explicit form of)
the second of (4.6). the interesting point here is that b depends on (, x) only  the new variables
enter in t only through a, c.

4.2 invariant actions for the minimal branescan

as already mentioned, part of the motivation for studying superspace extensions comes from their
relevance in the construction of manifestly invariant pbrane actions. for the branes of the old
branescan, wz terms on  have the form

sw z =zw

dp+1 lw z = zw

(b)

,

(4.9)

where b is dened10 as the potential of the closed (p + 2)form h on superspace

h = (c1...p)1 . . . p

(4.10)
w in (4.9) is the (p + 1)dimensional worldvolume swept out by the pbrane, parametrized by {i} =
(, 1, . . . , p), i = 0, 1 . . . p and  is the pullback of the embedding  : w  . the constant  is
xed by the requirement of invariance of the total action [1] (we will ignore  henceforth). as is
well known [1] (see also [2]), the closure of h is equivalent to the condition (3.3) which we have seen to
guarantee the existence of the noncentral extensions of sec. 3. using the new li oneforms available
we may obtain a li potential b for h on . its general form is

db = h .

,

b =

pxk=0

1...pk1...k(bk1 . . . pk 1 . . . k)  cc ,

(4.11)

where the last equation uses the notation of the previous section and denes c . the bks are numerical
constants, determined by the second eqn. in (4.10). we check that [b] = l1+ k

2 = lp+1.

2 lpkl

we compute now the explicit form for an invariant lw z in (4.9) (i.e., with b instead of b). for a

general oneform  we put ()  idi, so that



i = i,



i = ix + as(c)i

4.3 noether currents for the new symmetries

the invariance under translations of the action of the supersymmetric objects implies the existence of
conserved currents. the integrals of the charge densities over a spacelike section of the worldvolume
give constants of the motion for the pbrane. when the action contains the standard wz term b,
the noether current includes a term  coming from the quasi-invariance of b, b = d. this was
used in [12] to nd topological extensions of the supersymmetry algebra. when b is replaced by the
invariant b in (4.11),  is no longer present. however, the noether current receives now a contribution
from the additional elds (a), which leads to the same result.

one can derive general expressions for the currents associated with the new generators. in the
present case, where the relevant part of the lagrangian is obtained by pulling back to w forms
initially dened on , it is convenient to work on the extended superspace, where quantities have a
direct geometrical interpretation, and to pull the result back to w at the end. to keep the discussion
general, consider a manifold m which can serve as worldvolume and a target space n , of dimensions
m, n respectively (m < n) and an embedding  of m into n ,  : x 7 y(x) where {xi} ({yj}) are local
coordinates on m (n ). consider furthermore an action s given by

()

,

(4.15)

s =zm

y s =zm

where  is a kform on n and  is the pullback map associated with the embedding. we assume
that the submanifolds x0 = x0
f in of m form its boundary m  their embeddings in n are
the initial and nal conguration respectively. the equations of motion are

init, x0 = x0

(ly ) = 0 ,

(4.16)

where y is an arbitrary vector eld on n which vanishes on (m )  we denote their solutions
generically by cl. proceeding along the lines of the standard derivation, with inner derivations taking
up the role of the partials

, one nds the equations of motion in the form



,i

(iy d) = 0 ,

(4.17)

where now y is an arbitrary vector eld, not necessarily vanishing on m . for a symmetry generated
by y0 one obtains

(4.18)
which is the current conservation equation. for a quasi-invariant lagrangian, (ly0) = (d),
the conserved current picks up a term in , (j(y0)) = (iy0  ).

in the present case, (m, n, ) correspond to (w, , b). the variation of the total action from that

j(y0)  iy0 ,

d(cid:0)
cl(j(y0))(cid:1) = 0 ,

of the new coordinates comes only from lw z so that (4.17) gives
,

0 = (iy db) = (iy h)

(4.19)

cl(j a)(cid:1) = 0 ,
d(cid:0)

where y is an arbitrary vector eld along the bre. since h is horizontal, the above equations of
motion obtained from variations of the as, are satised trivially, consistent with the appearence
of the as in the lagrangian through exact dierentials. for the noether currents associated to
translations along the new coordinates we have y0  y a and (4.18) gives

j a = i y a

b

.

(4.20)

with b as in (4.11) and y a = (b1)a

cy c (see (4.5)), the second of (4.20) gives for j a

j a = (b1)a

(4.21)
c. notice that j a is, in this case, a form on  (rather than ). eecting explicitly

diy d c c = (b1)a

cc ,

since iy d c = d
the pullback in the rst of (4.20) we nd11

ijai = 0 ,

(4.22)
11eqn. (4.22) for jai also follows from the standard expression for the current associated with an internal symmetry
of a lagrangian l, jai = a() l
i() . however, for the currents considered here the relevant part of l is just lw z.
since lw z is obtained from a form on , the above derivation allows us to exploit the geometry of . the above
expression for the current also makes clear that, within the canonical formalism, the integrated charge operators will
reproduce the original symmetry algebra.

5.1 d=10, n=1 and the greenschwarz superstring

the case of the superstring is somewhat special, from the point of view of the extension algorithm of
sec. 3: the rst additional generator to be introduced, z , is a vector, as x. we shall keep it here
separate and denote by  the associated parameter. fixing (as, a0, a1) = ( 1

()
in the above equation is the one obtained from the second of (3.1) for p = 1  we have added a

superscript to avoid any confusion with , since they have similar dierentials; recall also that 
and  are unrelated. as mentioned in sec. 3, the two terms in the r.h.s. of the last of (5.1) are
individually closed and hence their relative normalization cannot be xed by requiring d(d) = 0.
we have nevertheless chosen the above symmetric normalization for convenience  the results that
follow, and in particular (5.12) that involves cancellations, do not depend essentially on this choice.

the corresponding lie algebra is given by

{d, d} = (c)x+(c)z  ,
(5.2)
which reduces to the green algebra [13] if one omits z . the associated group manifold (extended
superspace)  is parametrized by (, x, , ) via

[d, x] = (c)z  ,

[d, z ] = (c)z  ,

(in the expression for 12, the r.h.s.
is assumed to be symmetrised, with unit weight, in 1, 2).
the ((1)  (2)) instruction in the last two expressions means that for each term displayed, one
has to add (subtract) a similar term, with the primed and unprimed variables exchanged (taking into
account statistics), if the order of the term is odd (even) in the coordinates (e.g. ((1)  (2)) =
  (
)). this symmetry property can be seen to hold in general: from the bch formula
ea = ef (a,a) it follows that f (a,a)=f (a, a) and hence, terms of order n in the coordinates
ea
are symmetric (n odd) or antisymmetric (n even) under the above exchange of the two spaces. the

(5.29)

the above locally exact expressions result from rather non-trivial cancellations. the currents are
obtained by pulling back to w the forms (5.29). for periodic s the charges q11 , q11 (but not
q11 for a non-trivial two-cycle [12]) turn out to be zero. thus, this case provides a realization of
the algebra (5.14) where only the q11 term is non-zero.

6 the case of d-branes

let us consider rst a bosonic background for which all forms of the rr sector and the dilaton
vanish so that the two-form f  f  b, where f =da and b is the nsns two-form, reduces to f ;
a is the born-infeld one-form on the worldvolume a() = ai()di. then the action of the dp-brane
reduces to

i =z dp+1q det(ixjx + fij)

.

(6.1)

let us look for a manifestly supersymmetric generalisation of this action on a suitable extension of
at superspace (we shall consider here only d = 10, iia d-branes). for the ordinary p-branes the

supersymmetrisation is achieved by substituting rst 
for ix and then by adding a wz term b,
i
db = h, with h characterised [2] by being a non-trivial ce cohomology (p + 2)-cocycle on superspace
.
it was shown in the previous sections how to make these wz terms manifestly invariant. we
shall extend this to the dp-branes case by showing rst that the wz terms may be characterised and
classied by ce-cocycles as well, and then by nding manifestly supersymmetric potentials b on the
superspaces  which are obtained by the techniques of sec. 3 or by dimensional reduction from these.
we shall restrict ourselves here to the d2-brane case, and hence to its associated  parametrised by
(, x, , ,  , , , ).

6.1 ce-cocycle classication of d-branes

the new feature in the dp-brane case is the eld ai() directly dened on the worldvolume. the
one-form a transforms under supersymmetry in such a way that f  da  b is invariant, where b is
a two-form on superspace such that

db = (c11)

.

(6.2)

let us now consider a as an abstract form. in our approach, the possible wz terms will be some
non-trivial (p + 2)-cocycles of the cohomology of a certain fda (here, of iia type). this fda is
generated by the supersymmetric invariant ,  and f and dened by the structure relations

d = 0 ,

d =

1
2

(c) ,

df = (c11) .

(6.3)

note that dd  0 because the identity (c11)(c) = 0 is valid in d = 10. the non-trivial
(p + 2)-cocycles are given by closed (p + 2)-forms h constructed from , , f that cannot be written
as the dierential of a (p+1)-form constructed from them, and with the same dimensions as the kinetic
lagrangian, i.e. [h] = lp+1. this second requirement is necessary to avoid introducing dimensionful
constants in the action other than the tension, [t ]=m lp.

since f is a two-form, h can be expanded in powers of f as

h =

[ p+2

2 ]xn=0

1
n!

h(p+22n)(, )f n

,

(6.4)

where h(k) is a form of order k  p + 2  2n and, since d = 10, p  8 excluding the degenerate case
p + 1 = 10. moreover, since [h(p+22n)] = lp+12n, the k-forms h(k), [h(k)] = lk1, must be

h(k) = a(k)1 . . . k2(c1...k2) ,

k = 2, . . . , p + 2 ,

(6.5)

where  = 1 or 11 so that (c1...k2) is symmetric (i.e, k  2 = 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10 for 1 and
0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9 for 11). since

dh =

n!

dh(p+22n)f n +

[ p+2

2 ]xn=1

1

(n  1)!

(1)ph(p+22n)(c11)f n1

,

(6.6)

the required closure of h is equivalent to the following set of equations

dh(p2[p/2]) = 0 ,
dh(p+22n) + (1)ph(p2n)(c11) = 0 ,

for n =h p+2
2 i
2(cid:3) , . . . , 0 .
for n =(cid:2) p

(6.7)

at this point it is convenient to examine separately the p odd and p even cases.

a) p even

the rst eqn.

(6.4) having an additional dimensionful constant, [h(0)] = l1 ([f] = l2). for n = p

in (6.7) gives dh(0) = 0. this means h(0) = 0 because h(0) 6= 0 would imply by
2 the second

of (6.7) gives dh(2) = 0. inserting h(2) from eq. (6.5), we obtain an identity, so a(2) is arbitrary.14 the
remaining equations (for n = p2
2 , etc.) are equivalent, by factoring out products of forms  and
, to

a(4)(c2)(c12 )  a(2)(c11)(c111) = 0
2a(6)(c4)(c1...411)  a(4)(c[12)(c3]11) = 0
3a(8)(c6)(c1...6 )  a(6)(c[1...411)(c5]11) = 0
4a(10)(c8)(c1...8 11)  a(8)(c[1...6)(c7]11) = 0 .

(6.8)

note that the number of identities from (6.8) that are necessary to show that h is closed depends on
the values of p since 2  k  p + 2, k even. specically, for the d2-brane only the rst identity is used,
for the d4-brane the rst two identities are relevant and the rst three (four) identities are required
for the existence of the d6-(d8-)branes.

equations (6.8) have to be identically satised for certain values of the as to be determined.
to nd them, one may multiply the equations by (c 1) (although the resulting system is not
equivalent to the original one). this procedure gives some equalities between gamma matrices that
are only satised if a(2) = a(4), a(4) = 6a(6), a(6) = 15a(8) and a(8) = 28a(10). these values
are the solution of eqs. (6.8) and determine closed forms h by (6.4), (6.5) provided that the following
identities are satised

(c2)(c12) + (c11)(c111) = 0
(c4)(c1...4 11) + 3(c[12)(c3]11) = 0
(c6)(c1...6) + 5(c[1...411)(c5]11) = 0
(c8)(c1...811) + 7(c[1...6)(c7]11) = 0 ,

(6.9)

as it is indeed the case (see appendix b). therefore we have shown that, for p even, there exist closed
(p + 2)-forms h with the required dimensions for all even values of p, p  8.
to prove that the hs obtained from eq. (6.5) for the appropriate values of a(k) are not ce-trivial,
it is sucient to note that if there were a potential form b(, ,f), db = h, then this form would
be a lorentz-invariant (p + 1)-form with physical dimensions lp+1, which does not exist for p + 1 < 10
since p is even.

b) p odd

in this case, the rst eqn. in (6.7) gives dh(1) = 0. again, this means h(1) = 0 because obviously
there are no lorentz-scalar one-forms that can be constructed from ,  and f. on the other
hand, k in h(k) has now the range 3  k  p + 2, k odd. of these h(k), those corresponding to k = 5
and k = 9 vanish independently of the type of the matrix  (see table). this leaves us with h(3) and
h(7) and the second of (6.7) leads to

a(3)(c1)(c1) = 0 ,
a(7)(c7)(c1...5) = 0 ,

a(3)(c[1)(c2]11) = 0
a(7)(c[1...5)(c6]11) = 0 .

(6.10)

in the a(3) equations,  has to be 11 (the other possibility, 132, may be shown to be inconsistent
by multiplying the second expression by (c 1)). multiplying the fourth equation by (c 1)
shows that a(7) = 0 for both =1, 11. thus we have shown that the only candidate for a wz term
in the odd p case is obtained from h(3) i.e., from

h = (c11)f

(6.11)
but then h = d( 2
p+1f (p+1)/2) by (6.3), and hence is a trivial ce cocycle. therefore in the d = 10,
iia theory there are no non-trivial wz terms for the d-branes with p odd. the other values for p
found in our discussion are precisely those for which d-branes of type iia are known to exist. thus
the iia d-branes are, as the scalar p-branes [2], characterized by non-trivial ce cocycles.

p  1

,

14we note in passing that in the heterotic case, for which n = 1 ( is mw), a(2) = 0 because (c11) =
 = . so the chain of equations that follows does not appear and there are no non-trivial

c = 0 since (11)
wz terms. this shows, as expected, that there are no d-branes in the heterotic case.

6.2 d-branes dened on extended superspace

as we saw, one reason for considering superspace extensions associated with extended objects is that it
is possible to nd on  manifestly invariant wz terms since then h may be expressed as the dierential
of a li form b. we shall now show that this is also possible for the d2-brane. the starting point is
now the fda given in eq. (2.17) with the generators with more than two vector indices absent, plus
the equation for df i.e.

d = 0

d = 1

d(z)

 = 1

2 (c11)
2 (c11)

2 (c)
2 (c )

d = 1
d = 1
df = (c11) .

(6.12)

the reason one should start from (6.12) is that the dual of the algebra dened by the rst ve
equations is the one obtained when one computes the algebra of the noether charges associated with
the supertranslations in the case of the type iia d2-brane (see [38]).

the next step, as was done in sec. 3, is extending this algebra with the generators obtained
by replacing vector indices by spinorial ones. in the case of the d2-brane this is not dicult to do
because, apart from the equation for df, the free dierential algebra one starts with is actually the
dimensional reduction of the 11-dimensional one

d =

1
2

(c) ,

d =

1
2

(c) ,

(6.13)

in which one sets   (, 10 = ),   ( , 10 = (z)
 ). since this d = 11 algebra has
already been extended recursively in sec. 3 by the new one-forms  and , the extended algebra
in d = 10 is simply its dimensional reduction, for which   (, (z)
 ). the result is given by

eqs. (6.12) plus

d = (c)  + (c11) + (c)  (c11)(z)

(6.15)

we can now show, using the new forms in (6.14), that it is possible to nd an invariant wz term b,
h = db, on the extended superspace. in our case h is given by (eqs. (6.4), (6.5); k = 2, 4)

(6.16)
again, it is possible to expand b as b = b(3) + b(1)f. using this expression in h = db, and identifying
the result with h, yields db(1) = (c11), from which follows that b(1) = 2. similarly,

h = (c)  (c11)f .

db(3) = 2(c11) + (c) = (c) 

(6.17)

where in the last equality we have rewritten the expression using the eleven-dimensional notation.
this has the advantage that the expression for b(3) in d = 11 was given in (5.26),

b(3) =

(6.19)

this shows that on the extended superspace corresponding to eqs. (6.12) and (6.14), the wz term of
the type iia d2-brane can be made invariant, as was the case for the ordinary p-branes. we expect
that this result holds for the other values of p.

in contrast with the case of ordinary p-branes, the extended free dierential algebra is not the dual

of a lie algebra because of the equation for the two-form df. however, it is easy to check that

(6.20)

(6.21)

in accordance with (6.12), (6.14). this is not a surprising fact since from (6.12) we see that df is
equal to the h corresponding to the wz term of the type iia superstring on a at background. so it
has to be possible to write it as the dierential of an invariant form b = b(, , (z)
 ) on the
fully extended superspace  of the iia superstring. since f = da  b and b is dened on , da
may be written on . making use of its li forms i.e., of

(6.23)

in this way, the customary born-infeld worldvolume eld ai() becomes here (a), with a on  given
by (6.23), and its existence may be looked at as a consequence of extended supersymmetry.

the previous discussion shows that it is natural to rewrite the action of the d-branes on a at
background by using only objects that are initially dened on the appropriately extended superspace.
we show now that the euler lagrange (el) equations are still the same (provided a rather natural
condition is met) and that the gauge transformations of ai() can be reinterpreted in the new language.
so at this point it seems that the geometric dierence between the ordinary p-branes and the dp-branes
is that while the action of the former may be dened from forms on ordinary superspace , the action

of the latter requires the extended superspace of the iia superstring if one whishes to avoid objects
that only have a meaning on the worldvolume. in the iia superstring case the extended superspace
was also considered, but the new variables appeared only in the wz term and as total derivatives
(sec. 5.1) and thus had trivial el equations. in the d-brane case, in contrast, these variables have
nontrivial el equations.

let us now see how the el equations change by making the substitution a  dx + 1

2 d.
let i[x, , ai] be the action before making the subtitution, where ai are the coordinates of the form
a (a = aidi). the el equations are

i
x = 0 ,

i
 = 0 ,

i
aj

= 0 .

when the substitution is made, there are new terms in the equations, and they read

being zero, this would imply the collapse of one worldvolume dimension.

where the additional contributions come from the partial functional derivative terms. if
i

thus, we must have i
= 0 which in the rst equation of each set in (6.25) implies eqs. (6.24). hence
aj
both actions are equivalent. in fact, it may be shown that there is an additional gauge freedom which
accounts for the dierence of degrees of freedom between a (eqn. (6.23)) and ai(), but we shall not
discuss this here15. this seems to indicate that, when the action on w is obtained from entities on
, there is an additional gauge freedom which in our formulation plays a role complementing that of
-symmetry.

i
aj

finally, the u (1) gauge eld ai() on w has a gauge transformation ai() = i(). the
question now is what is the gauge transformation of the component elds if one writes aidi as (a).
in other words, for a given (), there should be a transformation of  and  in (6.23) reproducing
i. this may be obtained by means of a supereld  such that (x, ) = (). then if under
a gauge transformation one denes  =  and  = 2, (a) behaves as expected since
then [dx + 1
2 d] = i. the fact that when the supersymmetry transformations of a eld
close only modulus a gauge transformation one obtains an extension of a fda is not restricted to
dp-branes. in fact, one may achieve manifest invariance by introducing an electromagnetic potential
on the worldsheet in the green-schwarz superstring action, in which case the string tension is the
circulation of the potential around the string [49] (see also [50]) and a similar result applies to the
other scalar p-branes [51]. clearly, the worldvolume elds introduced there could be dened on our
appropriate extended superspaces as well. as for the iib dp-brane, an analysis similar to that in this
section for the iia case would classify them by rst showing that wz terms exist for odd p. in a second
stage, the worldvolume gauge eld a may be expressed as the pull-back of a iib superspace one-form.
in fact, this last point for the a in the p=1 iib d-string case has been discussed very recently in [22]
by introducing an appropriate extended group manifold. we may conclude, then, that the dierent
worldvolume elds may be expressed in terms of forms dened on suitably extended superspaces.

7 noether charges and d-brane actions

it follows from the discussion of sec. 6 that the worldvolume eld a() that appears in the d2-brane
action may be written on the superstring extended superspace parametrized by (x, , , ). on
the other hand, the d2-wz term, which is quasi-invariant in these coordinates, can be made strictly
invariant by further extending the previous superspace to  = (, x, , ,  , ,  , ). in
this way, the whole action is invariant.

15we thank p. townsend for discussions on this point.

if one now computes the canonical commutators (or poisson brackets) of the charges corresponding
to the symmetries of the action, the resulting algebra is exactly the ri version of the lie algebra dual
to (6.12) (removing its last line) plus (6.14), given in (6.15). the ri generator algebra ({q, q}, etc.)
is the same as (6.15) with an additional minus sign on the r.h.s. let us concentrate on the {q, q}
commutator,

{q, q} = (c)p + (c11) z  + (c) z  + (c11) z

(7.1)

(there has been a redenition of the generators so that {q, q} = +cp etc). let us assume that
we had written the action, as it is customary, in terms of (x, , a) alone, with a = a() directly
dened on w . in this case, the c and c11 contributions would come from the quasi-invariance
of the wz lagrangian, while c11 would be the result of the contribution of the a() eld to
the noether current [38] (see also [48]). this follows easily from the appropriate denition of the
conserved noether currents and charges (see, e.g., [26]) which include an additional piece when the
lagrangian is quasi-invariant, a common feature of the conventional actions for p-branes [12]. in the
present d-branes case, there is an additional contribution due to the worldvolume eld a() since its
transformation properties, a = , are postulated to compensate for those of the composite object b,
b = d, so that f = da  b is invariant. as a result, the supersymmetry transformations do not
close on a, and this produces an additional term by a mechanism similar to the one in the standard
quasi-invariance case.

these modications become evident in our context i.e., by formulating the action on the ex-
tended superspace. let us consider the d2-brane lagrangian with the quasi-invariant wz term
b = b(x, , , ). the conserved noether currents then have to include the quasi-invariance piece.
if we wrongly ignored this additional term, the (canonical formalism) algebra of the corresponding
(non-conserved, non-noether) charges would be the algebra of the symmetries x, , ,  of the
lagrangian, i.e.

{q, q} = (c)p + (c11) z 

.

(7.2)

the algebra of the conserved noether charges is not (7.2), however, because these must include the
quasi-invariance contribution. we may nd the correct algebra immediatley by replacing the quasi-
invariant wz term b, by b = b(x, , , ,  , , , ), which is manifestly invariant since the
transformation properties of the additional variables ( , , , ) remove the quasi-invariance of
b. by denition, the transformation properties of all the coordinates obviously close into the group
law or algebra. hence, it follows that the algebra of charges computed using the canonical formalism
reproduces (7.1), and that the contributions to z  and z are entirely due to the wz term b (or to
the quasi-invariance of b(x, , , ) if we used b instead).

8 branes with higher order tensors: the case of the m5-brane

we shall now show that the previous analysis can be applied also to other extended objects that are
neither ordinary p-branes nor d-branes. we shall consider here the case of the d = 11 m 5-brane,
which contains a worldvolume two-form eld a in the action (see [52]). the action in a at bosonic
background depends on a trough h = da  c, where c is a background three-form. we shall take
as our starting point the case with c = 0 and with all other forms of rank higher than one in that
action vanishing. we do not need to worry about the (generalized) self-duality condition for a on the
worldvolume, since this condition may arise as a eld equation for an auxiliary eld (see [52, 53]). the
supersymmetric action of the m5-brane is obtained in two steps. first, one substitutes h = da  c
for da, where c is a form on ordinary at superspace such that

dc = (c)

,

(8.1)

and the transformation properties of the worldvolume eld a are xed so that h is invariant. secondly,
a wz term is added to obtain  symmetry.

let us now nd the wz term in our framework. it should be obtained from the fda generated

by the abstract invariant forms , , h,

d = 0 ,

d =

1
2

(c) ,

dh = (c)  ,

(8.2)

and be given by a ce-non-trivial potential b of a closed form h(, , h). thus, we have to solve
the problem of nding nontrivial (p + 2)-cocycles of the fda (8.2). we shall nd that there is no
solution unless p = 5.

a general (p + 2)-form on (8.2) can be written as

h = h(p+2) + h(p1)h ;

there are no further powers of h since h 2  h  h = 0. the closure of h gives
dh(p+2) + dh(p1)h  (1)ph(p1)(c )  = 0 ,

which is equivalent to

dh(p1) = 0
dh(p+2) = (1)ph(p1)(c) .

now, since [h] = lp+1 and [h] = l3,

h(p+2) = a(p+2)(c1...p)1 . . . p
h(p1) = a(p1)(c1...p3)1 . . . p3 ,

(8.3)

(8.4)

(8.5)

(8.6)

for some constants a(p+2) and a(p1). the rst equation in (8.5) requires a(p1) = 0 unless p  3 = 2,
in which case a(p1) is arbitrary due to the identity (c )(c) = 0, valid in d=4, 5, 7, 11.
if p 6= 5, a(p1) = 0 and h(p1) = 0, and the second equation of (8.5) gives dh(p+2) = 0, which again
implies a(p+2) = 0 unless p = 2. but if p = 2, we have h = h(2+2)  (c) = dh, in
which case h is the dierential of a li form and hence ce-trivial. thus we are just left with the case
p = 5, a(51) arbitrary. inserting (8.6) in (8.5) gives, factoring out the s and s,

5
2

a(5+2)(c5)(c1...5) + a(51)(c[12)(c34]) = 0 .

(8.7)

the second identity in (b.1) gives a(7) =  2

15 a(4). the resulting closed form

h  (c1...5 )1 . . . 5  

15
2

(c12)1 2h

(8.8)

is not ce-exact, as may be seen by an argument analogous to that used in the iia d-branes case: a
li potential form b would have to be a scalar six-form depending on ,  and h with dimensions
l6, which does not exist.

it is possible to see, however, that a li expression for h exists on the appropriate extended
superspace. since h is a three-form, it has formally the same properties as the invariant wz term b of
the m2-brane, the extended superspace of which is the one corresponding to the lie fda obtained by
2 , 1, 1
the methods of sec. 3. eqs. (2.3), (3.1), (3.4) and the rst of (3.5) with (as, a0, a1, a2) = ( 1

(8.10)

we might now go on and show that there exists a li b such that h = db on a suitably extended
superspace; we shall omit its expression [19] since it is not needed below. what we wish to show is that
now we may use (8.10) to replace the worldvolume two-form a() by the pull-back of the two-form a
on extended superspace given by

9 conclusions

we have provided in this paper a unied approach to the study of various p-branes by dening them
on suitably extended superspaces. all of these are supergroup manifolds, extensions of the basic
odd abelian groups strd determined by the spinors of the specic theory considered. the extension
algorithms in secs.
2.2 and 3 show how they depend, when they do, on specic identities for -
matrices. the central extensions do not need any -identities, but the non-central ones require the
identities (3.3), precisely the ones needed to dene the wz terms of the old branescan.

the centrally extended superspaces are associated with (topological) charges, but the introduction
of manifestly supersymmetric wz terms requires the addition of non-central variables, already for the

branes of the old branescan. when the procedure is applied to dp-branes, it is seen that all the elds
in their action may also be dened by pullbacks of entities on the previously introduced superspaces.
in the language of fdas, our results show that all the fdas involved in the formulation of the
p-branes considered here become lie fdas on suitably extended superspaces. we conjecture, in
view of the previous discussion, that this is the case in general and that there exists an extended
superspace denition for all elds appearing in the action of the various p-branes. in other words,
there exists a kind of eld/extended superspaces democracy by which all brane worldvolume elds are
pullbacks from some target superspace . the appropriate  of the theory is given by an extension
of a certain strd and, using , the action can be dened in a manifestly invariant form.
in fact,
in this eld/extended superspace democracy context, the invariance properties seem to characterize
essentially the superbrane actions.
it should not come then as a suprise that -symmetric actions
may also be introduced for dp-branes, as in [8] for d-branes with rigid iia and iib superpoincare
symmetry. as is the case for ordinary p-branes, -symmetry is achieved when the relative coecient
of the kinetic and wz-like part is such that the bogomolnyi bound is saturated.

our extensions provide at the same time a connection between the ce cocycles and the mecha-
nism of partial breaking of supersymmetry. the ce (p+2)-cocycles lead to (extended) loop-type or
worldvolume current algebras (see, e.g. [12, 15, 54, 55, 56]) and the two-cocycle to the corresponding
algebra of charges dening the extended superspace algebra. the new variables in the extended su-
perspaces are also essential to dene (invariant) actions. they may also be relevant in the problem
of quantisation, the formulation of dualities (see sec. 2.3.1) and in the formulation of the additional
gauge freedom hidden in the denition of some superbrane elds, the worldvolume denition of which
reects an election of gauge. we suspect that the mathematical existence of the extensions considered
here has a deeper meaning beyond the aspects discussed in this paper.

note added. after completion of this paper an article [57] has appeared in hep-th, where an approach
similar to that in sec. 6.2 for the eld a is given for the iib d-brane case.

appendix

a non-central extensions

we give here some details of the derivation of (3.5). after introducing 1...p11 satisfying (3.4), we
look for non-trivial ce 2-cocycles with external indices (1 . . . p212). there are four available li
two-forms with these indices,

(1) = (c1...p2)12
(2) = (c)121...p2
(3) = (c)121...p2
(4) = (c)


(a.1)
none of which is closed. looking for a linear combination   (1) + 2(2) + 3(3) + 4(4) that is
closed, we compute (making use of the mc equations for the available s)

inside the rst curly brackets above, one can combine the third term with the second, changing at the
same time its sign (the s are antisymmetric in the vector indices). in the fourth term, one can also
symmetrise over ,  (since  and  commute). eecting explicitly this symmetrisation, as well as
the indicated one (by the primes) over 1, 2, one gets four terms, which, together with the other two,
give exactly the six permutations of (3.3) (the s are symmetric in the spinorial indices, so that the
twenty-four permutations of (3.3) reduce to six). the sum of all six terms will be zero (due to (3.3))
if their coecients are equal  this gives the equations

a02  a13 = 2as

,

a14 = 2as

.

(a.3)

inside the second curly brackets in (a.2), the last term is zero because of antisymmetry in , . the
sum of the rst two will be zero (for the same reason) if their coecients are equal, i.e. if

(the barred indices in the last term denote a second symmetrisation, besides the one over the primed
indices). there is a novelty here compared with the previous extension: there are four dierent types
of terms in the s, the coecients of which must separately vanish, giving rise to four linear equations
for the two unknowns 2, 3 (care must be taken of the fact that when the second symmetrisation in
the last term above is eected, corresponding to the barred indices, one obtains contributions to two
dierent types of terms in the s). making use of (3.3) and of the symmetry properties of the s, as
in the previous extension, one arrives at the (overdetermined) linear system

b d = 10 -matrix identities

we prove here the -identities needed in sec. 6.116. the rst two identities in (6.9) follow by dimen-
sional reduction from the known d = 11 relations

(c2)(c1 2) = 0
(c5)(c1...5)  3(c[1 2)(c3 4]) = 0

,

.

where the tilded indices  = 0, 1, . . . , 10.

the third identity can be proved as follows. first, using that

and the fact that 2

11 = 1, we see that

1...6 = 1...5 6  5[1...4 5]6

(c6)(c1...6) = (c6)(c1...511)(116)



(b.1)

(b.2)

(b.3)

since the second term in (b.2) does not contribute because (c1...4) is antisymmetric (primed
indices are symmetrised). now, due to the identity (c)(c11) = 0, we have
(c)(11)

(11) so that

 = ()
(c6)(c1...6) = (c1...5116)(116)
= 5(c[1...411)(c115])

,

(b.4)

where in the second equality use has been made of (b.2) and the fact that (c1...611) is anti-
symmetric.

finally, the fourth equation in (6.9) may be shown to be equivalent to the second. indeed, by mul-
(10q)! 1...q1...10q 1...10q ,

tiplying the fourth identity by 1...7123 and using that 1...q 11  1
one obtains

7!3!

(c[1)(c23]) +

6!4!7

4!

(c712311)(c711) = 0 ,

(b.5)

which is equivalent to the second equation in (b.1) due to the fact that i11 realize the same cliord
algebra as .
