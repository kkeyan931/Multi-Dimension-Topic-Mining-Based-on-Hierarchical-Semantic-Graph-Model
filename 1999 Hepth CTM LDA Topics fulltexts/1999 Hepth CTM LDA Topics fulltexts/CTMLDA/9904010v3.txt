abstract

anomalies of n = (4, 4) superconformal eld theories coupled to
a conformal supergravity background in two dimensions are computed
by using the ads/cft correspondence. we nd that weyl, axial gauge
and super weyl transformations are anomalous, while general coordinate,
local lorentz, vector gauge and local super transformations are not. the
coecients of the anomalies show that the superconformal eld theories
have the central charge expected in the ads/cft correspondence.

1. introduction

according to the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] the string/m-theory in (d +
1)-dimensional anti de sitter (ads) space times a compact space is dual to a d-
dimensional conformal eld theory (cft) dened on the boundary of the ads space.
there is a one-to-one correspondence between boundary values 0i(x) of bulk elds
i(x) and operators oi(x) in the boundary cft. the generating functional of
correlation functions of operators oi in the cft is given by the partition function
of the string/m-theory. in a certain limit the string/m-theory is approximated by a
low energy eective supergravity and the partition function is given by a stationary
point of the supergravity action s[]

*exp iz ddx xi

0i(x)oi (x)!+cft

= exp(is[]).

(1.1)

here, 0i on the left hand side are arbitrary functions dened on the d-dimensional
boundary while i on the right hand side are the solutions of supergravity eld
equations in the bulk satisfying boundary conditions i = 0i.

the boundary elds 0i are expected to form supermultiplets of a d-dimensional
conformal supergravity [4, 5] since they couple to cft operators.
in ref. [6] we
studied this relation between ads supergravities in d + 1 dimensions and conformal
supergravities in d dimensions in the case of three-dimensional (p, q) ads super-
gravities based on the superalgebra osp(p|2)  osp(q|2) [7]. we explicitly showed
that the local symmetry transformations of the bulk ads supergravities induce the
local transformations of the boundary elds 0i, which coincide with those of two-
dimensional conformal supergravities for p, q  2. in particular, weyl and super
weyl transformations on the boundary are generated from general coordinate and
super transformations in the bulk.

the purpose of this paper is to compute anomalies of the local transformations of
conformal supergravities on the boundary by using the ads/cft correspondence.
by eq. (1.1) the eective action for cfts in the background conformal supergravity
elds 0i is given by the classical supergravity action evaluated at solutions of eld
equations with boundary conditions i = 0i. anomalies are obtained by computing
variations of the supergravity action for the local symmetry transformations

a = s[].

(1.2)

although anomalies arise as a quantum eect in the cft side, they can be obtained
by classical calculations in the supergravity side. weyl anomaly in a purely grav-
itational background was computed by using the ads/cft correspondence in ref.
[8]. our work is a generalization of this result to the case of a supergravity back-
ground. anomalies of bosonic symmetries in the ads/cft correspondence were
also discussed in refs. [9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

we use the three-dimensional n = (4, 4) ads supergravity based on the su-
peralgebra su(1,1|2)  su(1,1|2) to compute anomalies. as in ref. [6] the local
symmetry transformations in this bulk theory will be shown to generate those of
the two-dimensional n = (4, 4) conformal supergravity [14] on the boundary. the
n = (4, 4) ads supergravity arises from the type iib supergravity on ads3s3m4,
where m4 is k3 or t4. this spacetime corresponds to a system of parallel q1 d1-
branes and q5 d5-branes in the low energy limit [15, 16]. the q1 d1-strings are
stretching in one dimension on the q5 d5-branes and the remaining four-dimensional
directions of the d5-branes are wrapping on m4. in the infrared limit the gauge the-
ory on the branes is described by a n = (4, 4) super cft with the central charge
c = 6q1q5 = 3l
2g [15, 16], where l is the radius of the ads space and g is the three-
dimensional gravitational constant. the n = (4, 4) ads supergravity is expected to
be dual to this cft [1, 17, 18].

we nd that weyl, axial gauge and super weyl transformations are anomalous,
while general coordinate, local lorentz, vector gauge and local super transformations
are not. the coecients of the anomalies show that the two-dimensional cft has
the n = (4, 4) super virasoro algebra with the central charge c = 3l
2g as expected
in ref. [1, 17, 18]. this also agrees with the value of the central charge obtained in
ref. [19] by computing the asymptotic symmetry algebra of three-dimensional ads.
since our calculations of anomalies do not much depend on special properties in
three dimensions, generalization to higher dimensions will be straightforward.

in the next section we give the action and the local symmetry transformation
laws of the n = (4, 4) ads supergravity in three dimensions. the relation to the
n = (4, 4) conformal supergravity on the two-dimensional boundary is discussed
in sect. 3. boundary terms and counterterms to be added to the bulk action are
obtained in sect. 4 and anomalies are computed in the nal section.

2. three-dimensional ads supergravity

we consider a three-dimensional ads supergravity which has 16 supersymmetries.
it is based on the superalgebra su(1,1|2)  su(1,1|2), which contains so(2,2) 
su(2)  su(2) as a bosonic subalgebra. we call this theory as n = (4, 4) ads
supergravity. note that this theory is dierent from the n = (4, 4) theory in ref. [7]
based on the superalgebra osp(4|2)  osp(4|2), which contains so(2,2)  so(4)
 so(4) as a bosonic subalgebra.

lorentz indices as a, b,   = 0, 1, 2. the rarita-schwinger elds satisfy doubly-

where the superscript c denotes the charge conjugation and 12 = 21 = 1. we
use the following conventions. the at metric is ab = diag(1, +1, +1) and the
totally antisymmetric tensor abc is chosen as 012 = +1. 2  2 gamma matrices a
satisfy {a, b} = 2ab. s with multiple indices are antisymmetrized products of
gamma matrices with unit strength. in particular, we have abc = abc in three
dimensions. the dirac conjugate of a spinor  is dened as  = i0.

the action consists of three parts:

s = sbulk + sboundary + s,

where sbulk is the bulk action while sboundary and s represent boundary terms and
counterterms respectively, which will be discussed in sect. 4. the bulk action is

three-dimensional ads supergravities with n = (p, q) supersymmetries for
p, q = 1, 2, 4 can be obtained from the above n = (4, 4) theory by consistent trunca-
tions. for instance, the n = (2, 2) theory in ref. [7] can be obtained by a truncation

3. local symmetries on the boundary

as in ref. [6] we partially x the gauge for the local symmetries (2.8) and obtain
how the residual local symmetries act on the elds on the boundary. we repre-
sent the three-dimensional ads space as a region x2 > 0 in r3 with coordinates
(x0, x1, x2). the boundary of the ads space corresponds to a plane x2 = 0 and a
point x2 = . our gauge xing conditions are

2   = 0,

(3.14)

where , ,   = 0, 1 and a, b,   = 0, 1 are two-dimensional world indices and local
lorentz indices respectively. the metric in this gauge has a form

dxm dxn gm n =

1

(2mx2)2 (cid:16)dx2dx2 + dxdx g(cid:17) .

(3.15)

the so(2,2) invariant ads metric corresponds to the case g =  but we consider
the general g. we dene e

where  = 1

elds with  behave as o((x2)0) near the boundary. we impose boundary conditions

are xed functions on the boundary. since eld equations of the rarita-schwinger
elds and the gauge elds are rst order, boundary conditions are imposed on only
half of their components. other components of the elds on the boundary are non-
local functionals of the elds 0i, which are obtained by solving the eld equations.

where 0, 
0   are arbitrary functions of x0 and x1. order
o(x2) and o((x2)2) terms are non-local functionals of these functions and the elds
0i. substituting eqs. (3.16), (3.17), (3.18) into eq. (2.8) and taking the limit x2  0
we obtain transformations of the elds on the boundary 0i. these transformations
are shown to coincide with those of the two-dimensional (4,4) conformal supergravity
[14].

4. boundary terms and counterterms

to compute anomalies (1.2) for the local transformations (3.20) we need the total
action (2.4) including the boundary terms and the local counterterms. the boundary
terms are chosen such that the variational principle is well-dened [20, 21, 22].
when we take a variation of the action, we obtain boundary terms arising from
partial integrations in addition to bulk terms proportional to eld equations. such
boundary terms should be cancelled by a variation of sboundary in eq. (2.4) when the
boundary conditions (3.17) are used. we nd that appropriate boundary terms are

sboundary = z d2x(cid:20) 1

(4.23)

the rst term is equivalent to the usual boundary term for the einstein action,
which is proportional to the trace of the second fundamental form of the boundary
[23].

the bulk action and the boundary terms are both divergent. one has to reg-
ularize them and subtract singular terms by the counterterms s. the singular
terms turn out to be local functionals of the elds 0i. we regularize divergences
by restricting the range of x2 to x2 > , where  > 0 is a cut-o parameter. the
boundary is now at x2 = . the regularization is removed for   0.

let us evaluate singular terms in sbulk and sboundary to obtain the local countert-

erms s. using the eld equations the bulk action becomes

sbulk = z d2xz

m(x2)3 e

as in ref. [8] we then expand the metric in x2 as

(4.24)

g = g0 + (2mx2)2g(2) + (2mx2)2 log(2mx2)2h(2) + o((x2)3).

(4.25)

coecients of these expansion g(2), h(2) ,    are determined as functions of the
elds 0i by solving the eld equations. to compute singular terms in eq. (4.24)
we need to know the expansion of e = g, which are determined by g
0 g(2) and
g
0 h(2) . they can be obtained from the (22) component of the einstein equation
as in ref. [8]. we nd g

0 h(2) = 0 and

log  r0(cid:21) .

(4.26)

(4.27)

the singularities of  terms in eq. (4.24) have been cancelled by those coming from
eq. (4.26). to obtain singular terms in the boundary terms (4.23) we rst note that
all the terms in eq. (4.23) except the rst are nite. by using the explicit form of
the spin connection the rst term can be written as

(4.28)

where we have used eqs. (4.25), (4.26) in the second equality. the counterterms are
chosen to cancel the singularities in eqs. (4.27), (4.28) as

s = z d2x(cid:20)

2m2

e0 +

1
4m

log  e0r0(cid:21) + snite,

(4.29)

10

where snite is a nite local term. the second term of the integrand is proportional
to the euler density, which is a total derivative locally, and will be ignored in the
following.

we note that s is a local functional of the boundary elds 0i. in principle, it
could depend on other components of the elds such as  
0, which is a non-local
functional of 0i. from the ads point of view it is not clear why they should be local.
the locality of singular terms may be understood by the ir-uv connection [24].
infrared divergences in the bulk theory can be interpreted as ultraviolet divergences
in the boundary cft. since ultraviolet divergences are short distance property of
the cft, they should be local.

5. anomalies

we compute a variation of the total action (2.4) under the local symmetry trans-
formations (3.20) and obtain anomalies of the two-dimensional (4,4) cft. since
the boundary transformations (3.20) are generated from the bulk transformations
(2.8), we can use the latter to compute a variation in the bulk. let us rst consider
the bosonic transformations. for the moment we assume snite = 0 in eq. (4.29).
under the three-dimensional general coordinate transformation with a parameter
m the bulk action transforms as

gsbulk = z d2xz 



dx2 m (cid:16)mlbulk(cid:17)

= z d2x 0lbulk
= z d2x e00(cid:20)

1
m2 +

1
4m

r0(cid:21) ,

(5.30)

where lbulk is the integrand of eq. (2.5) or eq. (4.24).
in the last equality we
have used eq. (4.26). the transformation of the boundary terms (4.23) and the
local counterterms (4.29) can be easily computed by using the transformation laws
(3.20) and eq. (4.28). using the quantities in eqs. (3.19), (3.22) we obtain the
transformation of the total action as

gs =

1

4m z d2x e r.

11

(5.31)

we see that the total action is invariant under the two-dimensional general coor-
dinate transformation but not under the weyl transformation. as for the local
lorentz transformation the bulk action (2.5) and the local counterterms (4.29) are
manifestly invariant. the boundary action (4.23) is also invariant when the rst
term is expressed as in eq. (4.28). therefore, the total action is invariant under the
local lorentz transformation

ls = 0.

(5.32)

under the su(2)  su(2) gauge transformation the chern-simons terms in the bulk
action (2.5) give two-dimensional chiral gauge anomaly [25]. combining with the
transformation of the boundary action we obtain

it is possible to preserve the diagonal vector su(2) subgroup of the su(2)  su(2)
gauge symmetry by introducing an appropriate nite counterterm. by choosing

snite = 

we obtain

gs =

2m z d2x  tr(cid:16)a f(cid:17) ,

(5.34)

(5.35)

where f is the eld strength of the su(2) gauge eld a. we see that there is no
anomaly in the vector su(2) gauge transformation with the parameter v. since the
nite counterterm (5.34) is invariant under the general coordinate and local lorentz
transformations, the introduction of it does not change the results (5.31), (5.32).

to obtain the supertransformation of the action we rst compute the variation

of the total action as

which cancels the last term in eq. (5.37). on the other hand, by using eq. (5.39) the
remaining terms in eq. (5.40) become

collecting these results and after some more algebra we nally obtain the super-
transformation of the total action as

(5.43)

where  



is the eld strength of the rarita-schwinger elds dened in eq. (3.21).

to summarize, our results of anomalies for the local symmetry transformations
are given by eqs. (5.31), (5.32), (5.35) and (5.43). there is no anomaly in two-
dimensional general coordinate, local lorentz, vector su(2) gauge and local su-
per transformations. the remaining symmetries, i.e., two-dimensional weyl, axial-
vector gauge and super weyl symmetries, are anomalous. the anomalies (5.31),
(5.32), (5.35) and (5.43) form an anomaly supermultiplet [26], in the sence that
they transform to one another by the two-dimensional local supertransformation.
this can be shown by using the wess-zumino consistency condition [27, 28] and
the absence of the two-dimensional local supersymmetry anomaly. these anomalies
correspond to the (4,4) super virasoro algebras with the central charge c = 6
m = 3l
2g .
anomalies in the (p, q) theories for other values of p, q = 1, 2, 4 can be obtained from
these results by truncation of the elds discussed at the end of sect. 2.
