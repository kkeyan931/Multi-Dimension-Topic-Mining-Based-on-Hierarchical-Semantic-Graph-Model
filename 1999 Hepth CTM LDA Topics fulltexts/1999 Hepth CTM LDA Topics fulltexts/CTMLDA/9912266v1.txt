abstract

we study the relation between intersecting ns5-branes whose intersection is
smoothed out and the deformed conifold in terms of the supergravity solution. we
solve the condition of preserved supersymmetry on a metric inspired by the deformed
conifold metric and obtain a solution of the ns5-branes which is delocalized except
for one of the overall transverse directions. the solution has consistent properties
with other congurations obtained by string dualities.

1 introduction

a system of parallel d3-branes at a conifold [1, 2, 3, 4] has been discussed from the
viewpoint of ads/cft correspondence [5] (and for a review [6]). from the properties of
the conifold, we can identify the eld theory on the n d3-branes with n = 1 gauge group
su(n)  su(n) theory with a quartic superpotential in the infrared [2].

by using t-dualities, the system is mapped to congurations of d-branes and inter-
secting ns5-branes over a 1+3 dimensional world-volume [7, 8]. in the brane picture, one
can intuitively read out the gauge group and the spectrum of the microscopic theory on
the d-branes.

the t-duality relations between intersecting ns5-branes and the conifold have an
important role to map the system of d3-branes at the conifold singularity to the brane
congurations.

the relation between the ns5-branes and the conifold is discussed in terms of super-
gravity solutions by performing the t-duality along one of the overall directions of the
ns5-branes [7]. the t-duality maps the eld theory on the d3-branes at the conifold
singularity onto d4-branes which are stretched between both sides of ns5-branes and
extend along the compactied direction. such congurations are called as elliptic mod-
els [9]. the duality relation is generalized to other conifold types and various types of
ns5-branes [8, 10, 11].

there is another t-duality relation between the intersecting ns5-branes and the coni-
fold [12]. the ns5-branes are mapped to the conifold by performing two t-dualities along
one of the relative transverse directions of each ns5-brane. by taking these t-dualities,
one has d5-branes which ll the compact brane box [13, 14]. it is discussed that the inter-
secting point of ns5-branes must be resolved to obtain the eld theory on the d5-branes
which has suitable gauge group and superpotential [11]. the intersecting ns5-branes are
also described by a single ns5-brane wrapping the curve which supports a non trivial s1
that d5-branes can end. such ns5-brane is called ns5-brane with a diamond. in the
conifold picture, the conifold singularity is resolved.

in the absence of d-branes, local mirror symmetry is proposed between generalized and
orbifolded conifolds [11]. the mirror transformation is equivalent to the t-duality on the
supersymmetric toroidal 3-cycle which calabi-yau manifolds and their mirror manifolds
equip [15]. in the conifolds picture, the t-duality is equivalent to the combination of above
two types of t-dualities. performing the mirror transformation to the blownup conifold,
one nd that the deformed conifold is mapped to the ns5-brane with the diamond by the
t-duality along one of the overall transverse directions.

1

our purpose in the present paper is to explore the relation between the ns5-branes
with the diamond and the deformed conifold in terms of supergravity solutions. the
guide-line to obtain the deformed conifold metric is discussed in [16] and the explicit
metric is presented in [17]. we start with a metric inspired by the deformed conifold
metric. solving the condition of the preserved supersymmetry, after some replacements
of line elements [7] and the t-duality, we will have a solution of the ns5-branes with a
diamond which is delocalized except for one of the overall transverse directions. as a
result, we nd that the size of the diamond relates to the displacement of end points of a
d4-brane on a ns5-brane. we conrm it by using string dualities.

this paper is organized as follows.

in sec. 2, we present a short summary on the
duality relations between metics of the ns5-branes and the conifold [7], and discuss the
deformation of the conifold algebraic geometry [11]. we also explicitly give the deformed
conifold metric [16, 17]. in sec. 3, we construct the ns5-branes with the diamond metric
and show that the metric is also obtained from the intersecting ns5-branes metric by
some coordinate transformation. in sec. 4, we make clear the meaning of the size of the
diamond by using some string dualities. sec. 5 is devoted to conclusion and discussion.

2 ns5-branes and conifold

2.1 duality relations

let us start with intersecting ns5 and ns5-branes whose world-volume directions are

ns5 (0
ns5
(0

7 8 9).

3 4

(2.1)

we consider the intersecting ns5-branes metric smeared except for the x1-direction. the
metric relates to the conifold metric by the t-duality along the x2-direction [7].

the conifold is topologically a cone over a 5-dimensional base manifold s2  s3. to
see the relation between ns5-branes and the conifold, it is useful to look the geometry of
the base manifold as u(1) bration over a base s2  s2. in the intersecting ns5-branes
background, we have a similar geometry which is s1 over r2  r2. here s1 is the x2-
direction which is compactied to take the t-duality, and r2  r2 is the (x3, x4) and
(x5, x6) directions which are planer. therefore we must compactify the directions in
order to t the topology to the conifold. this is done by replacing the mauer-cartan
1-form of r2  r2 by of s2  s2, that is,

dx3,5  sin 1,2 d1,2,

2

(2.2)

dx4,6  d1,2.

(2.3)

after the t-duality, we have the conifold metric below up to coecients with certain
replacements, for example x2   where  is the coordinate on the u(1) ber. it is
dicult to determine the coecients from the intersecting ns5-branes metric because the
metric is delocalized except for only one direction though the conifold metric localizes in
the all directions.

the conifold metric is given in [16],

ds2

(d + cos 1d1 + cos 2d2)2! .

(2.4)

xi=1

here r is a radial coordinate in the conifold and relates to the x1-direction in the inter-
secting ns5-branes picture.

the relation between the generalized and orbifolded conifold whose singularities are
resolved is discussed in [11]. the simplest example of it is the t-duality or mirror symme-
try between the deformed conifold and the blowup of conifold. the conifold has vanishing
2-cycle and 3-cycle at the origin where is an isolated singular point. in the intersecting
ns5-branes picture, the singularity corresponds to a singular point where the ns5-brane
intersects with the ns5-brane. on the conifold the singularity can be resolved by deform-
ing the conifold. in the ns5-brane picture, the deformation smooth out the intersection
with a non-vanishing cycle.

the conifold is algebraically dened by x y = u v, where (x, y, u, v)  c4. the de-

formed conifold is described

xy = uv + 2

(2.5)

where the singularity is resolved by a 3-cycle with non-zero radius . by using the t-
duality the deformed conifold maps to ns5-branes wrapping a curve which appears on
uv = 0 [18],

xy = 2.

(2.6)

in the conifold case,  vanishes and the curve becomes xy = 0. the solution separates
into x = 0 and y = 0. each equation describes a location of the ns5-brane. hence the
conifold simply maps to intersecting ns5 and ns5-branes after the t-duality. this fact
agrees with the discussion using the metric. when the  6= 0, the curve (2.6) is smooth
and describes topologically a sphere of radius . we call the non-vanishing cycle which
ns5-branes wrap as a diamond [11].

2.2 metric of the deformed conifold

the metric of (2.5) is determined from the condition that the metric is ricci at and
kahler [16, 17],

ds2 = f tr(dw dw ) + f |tr(w dw )|2.

(2.7)

(2.8)

here w is a complex 2  2 matrix which satises the condition corresponding to (2.5),
(2.9)

2.

det w = 

1
2

here we x  as a real parameter. we dene a radial coordinate 2 in c4 space as

2  tr(w w ).

(2.10)

d(2) is determined by the condition that the

f = f (2) is a kahler potential and f   df
metric is ricci at as
f  =  2

3 k.

here k is a function dened as

k( ) 

(sinh 2  2 )

2  2 cosh  .

we now take w as

w = l w r,

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

.

the su(2) matrix l, r are parametrized in terms of euler angles,

where k = 1, 2 for l, r respectively. the stability group of w is a u(1) which xes
1 + 2  .

eventually we have the deformed conifold metric,

ds2 = k

the determinant of the deformed conifold metric is proportional to sinh4  which vanishes
if   0, and the deformed conifold reduces to a lower-dimensional subspace. from
eq.(2.13), the limit means that    where the stability group enhances to su(2). at
 = , the geometry becomes (su(2)  su(2))/su(2) = s3. so the deformed conifold
metric reduces to the s3 surface metric.

if we take another limit,

2 = 2 cosh 

xed as

, 1/  ,

(2.21)

the deformed conifold metric (2.17) reduces to the conifold one (2.4) with a coordinate
transformation 2 = ( 2
2 r3. thus we conrm that when the size of 3-cycle  vanishes the
3)
metric smoothly deforms to the conifold one.

3

the deformed conifold metric has the term (2.20) which does not exist in the conifold
case (2.4). since the deformed conifold is considered as the t-dual of the ns5-branes
with a diamond, we expect that the additional term is closely related to an eect of the
existence of diamond.

3 ns5-branes with a diamond metric

in this section, we consider the ns5-branes with the diamond metric which is smeared
except for one of the overall transverse directions x1 as in the previous section. the metric
of the ns5-branes with the diamond becomes the deformed conifold metric after the t-
duality. in this case, there is no gauge elds and dilaton background in the corresponding
string theory. so we focus only on the metric of the t-dual of ns5-branes for a while and
solve the condition for a preserved supersymmetry on the metric.

the deformed conifold metric (2.17) is fully localized. on the other hand, however,
we are looking for a smeared metric. in this case, we assume that some replacements of
the line elements would be again similar to the intersecting ns5-branes and conifold case,

sin 1,2d1,2  dx3,5,
d1,2  dx4,6,

5

(3.1)

(3.2)

and

d  dx2.

(3.3)

we now would like to take the t-duality along the x2-direction. hence we need a
u(1) isometry along the direction. however, we have functions depending on the x2-
coordinate which are sin x2 and cos x2 in the deformed conifold metric (2.17) in the above
replacements. we assume that they become some constants a1 and a2 after delocalization.
so eqs.(2.18), (2.19) and (2.20) become

ds2

1 = (dx2 + b1dx3 + b2dx5)2,

6

ds2

ds2

(dxi)2,

xi=3

2 =
3 = 2 (a1 (dx3 dx6 + dx5 dx4) + a2 (dx4 dx6  dx3 dx5)).

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

here b1, b2 are some functions which could not be determined by the above replacements
even in the conifold case. they should be determined by solving the supersymmetry
condition. we will specify the functions by an ansatz as we will see below.

thus we consider the superstring compactication on the six-dimensional curved space

which described by the following metric,

ds2 = gdxdx

= a(x1)2 (dx1)2 + b(x1)2 ds2

1 + 2c(x1) ds2

2 + 2d(x1) ds2
3 .

(3.7)

here a(x1), b(x1), c(x1) and d(x1) are functions depending only on the x1-coordinate.
2d(x1) as d(x1)
1 + a2
2

we have introduced a1 and a2 as arbitrary constants. if we rescaleqa2
3, the constants a1 and a2 become a1/qa2

2 and a2/qa2

3 (3.6). therefore the redenition means that we simply set

and ds2
in ds2

1 + a2

2 as ds2

3/qa2

1 + a2

1 + a2

a1  sin ,
a2  cos 

(3.8)

(3.9)

where  is a constant.

since we expect that above metric (3.7) becomes the solution of ns5-branes with a
diamond after the t-duality along the x2-direction, we make the following ansatz before
solving the preserved supersymmetry condition:
(i) the both x1 and x2-directions are the overall transverse directions to the ns5-branes
after the t-duality. therefore the coecients of (dx1)2 and (dx2)2 must be the same
after that. since the metric g and the t-dualized metric j are related each other by

6

j11 = g11 and j22 = 1/g22 [19], it means that

b(x1) = a(x1)1

(3.10)

for the metric (3.7).
(ii) after the t-duality, non zero components of the ns-ns 2-eld are b23 = g23/g22 =
b1 and b25 = g25/g22 = b2. the ns5-brane charge is given by an integral of the
3-form eld strength h = db. we restrict that the ns5-branes charges are measured on
the outside of the diamond. this is because the origin of the deformed conifold is on
the 3-cycle with non-zero radius. the deformed conifold metric is not dened inside the
3-cycle. the size of 3-cycle corresponds to the size of the diamond. therefore we expect
that the ns5-branes with the diamond metric inspired by the deformed conifold metric
is also dened only on the outside of the diamond. since we consider the case that all
directions except for the one direction are smeared, we assume that the components of
the eld strength are constants. so the components of the ns-ns 2-form linearly depend
i=3 mi xi. we can set n3, m5, m3 = 0 by

on the coordinates, b23 = p6

using a gauge transformation. thus we have

i=3 ni xi and b25 = p6
b1 = (n4 x4 + n5 x5 + n6 x6),
b2 = (m4 x4 + m6 x6).

(3.11)

(3.12)

note that we still consider a single diamond, but we introduce ni and mi. this means
that some individual ns5-branes wrap the same diamond.

let us consider the iia theory compactied on the 6-dimensional metric. since there
are no gauge elds and dilaton, we can trivially lift to the 11 dimensional theory. there-
fore we equivalently consider unbroken supersymmetry in the 11-dimensional theory for
simplicity.

the condition of preserved supersymmetry is that the supersymmetric variation with
respect to the gravitino must vanish, namely  = 0, in a vanishing gravitino background,

from eq.(3.25),  must be a constant spinor. when d = 0, n5 = n6 = m4 = 0, n 
n4 = m6 and a = 2c = 1 + n|x1|, the metric (3.7) becomes the t-dual of the usual

intersecting n ns5-ns5 branes solution. indeed 1/4 supersymmetries are preserved. for
such solution, for example, eq.(3.31) becomes

f =

(3.38)

where  is a constant spinor. it is easy to check that the solution  also satisfy all other
conditions (3.27)-(3.30). so the solution (3.39) has unbroken 1/4 supersymmetries for the
intersecting ns5-branes.

the ns5-branes with the diamond must preserve the same supersymmetries as eq.(3.39)
of intersecting ns5-branes since they are described by the same holomorphic coordinates
[20]. the conditions for preserving supersymmetry are

the metric (3.51) is a non-compact cy metric. it is straightforward to check that the
metric is indeed ricci at.

the determinant of the metric (3.51) is proportional to (1  2)2 which vanishes if
2  1. it seems to be the same as the deformation of conifold case where the determinant
of the metric vanishes on the s3 surface. however, since the metric (3.51) is smeared, the
meaning of this limit is not so clear. we will discuss the meanings soon later.

let us consider the compactication of the 10-dimensional type ii theory on the 6-
dimensional space (3.51) 3, and take the t-duality along the x2-direction. the duality
relations are proposed in [19]. we have the following components relative to the metric
(3.51):

jmn = gmn 
g2m
b2m = 
,
g22

g2m g2n

g22

,

j22 =

1
g22

,

e2 =

1
g22

.

(3.56)

(3.57)

here m, n are 0, 1, 3,   , 9, and  is the dilation of the theory after the t-duality. the
metric becomes

ds2 = (dx0)2 + h 2

2

xi=1

(dxi)2 + h (

6

xi=3

(dxi)2 +  ds2

3) +

9

xi=7

(dxi)2

(3.58)

where

ds2

3 = 2(sin  (dx3 dx6 + dx4 dx5) + cos (dx4 dx6  dx3 dx5)),

and the dilaton is given by

e2  = h 2.

3 we may consider both the iia and iib theory, since there are no r-r elds.

(3.59)

(3.60)

11

the non-vanishing components of the ns-ns 3-form eld strength become

h234 = h256 = n.

(3.61)

the metric (3.58) reduce to the intersecting ns5-ns5-branes metric smoothly if  = 0,
and the preserved supersymmetries are the same as intersecting ones. therefore we found
the metric of the ns5-branes with a diamond smeared except for the x1-direction and the
parameter  corresponds to the size of the diamond 4.

let us consider the large size of the diamond 2  1. then the determinant of the
metric vanishes and the metric is singular. this is because we have made the metric with
the ansatz that the charges of ns5-branes are measured outside the diamond. the ansatz
is broken if the point where the charges are measured meets with the diamond. this is
a nice correspondence with the deformed conifold metric whose determinant vanishes if
one goes on the s3 surface,   0 as we have seen in sec. 2.2.

the metric (3.58) describes the ns5-branes with the diamond which is in the delocal-
ized directions. let us see that the metric (3.58) can transform to the ordinary intersecting
one and the diamond shrinks.

first, the parameter  is an angle of a coordinate rotation on either the (x3, x4) or
(x5, x6) plane. if we choose the (x3, x4) plane 5, we can remove it by the following rotation
of the coordinates:

x3  cos  x3 + sin  x4
x4   sin  x3 + cos  x4.

(3.62)

(3.63)

the 3-form eld strength (3.61) does not change by the rotation. the o-diagonal part
in the metric (3.59) becomes

ds2

3  2 (dx4 dx6  dx3 dx5),

(3.64)

and other parts do not change. thus the parameter  is removed from the solution of
ns5-branes with the diamond.

the metric can be diagonalized by the following coordinate transformation:

x3  x3 +  x5,
x6  x6   x4.

(3.65)

(3.66)

4 more precisely p|| can be identied with the size of the diamond, as we will see in sec 4.2.

5 even if we choose the (x5, x6) plane, the following discussion is appropriate to the plane.

12

the terms which associates with the (x3, x4, x5, x6) directions in the metric become

ds2

3456  h (cid:16)(dx3)2 + (1  2)(cid:16)(dx4)2 + (dx5)2(cid:17) + (dx6)2(cid:17) .

(3.67)

the components of eld strength do not change by the transformation (3.65) and (3.66).
finally we rescale the (x4, x5) coordinates as

x4  x412 ,
x5  x512 ,

and the parameter n as

then we have the intersecting ns5 solution

n  q1  2 n.

ds2 = (dx0)2 + h 2

(dxi)2 + h

2

xi=1

(dxi)2 +

xi=3

(dxi)2

9

xi=7

where

h = 1 + n|x1|.

(3.68)

(3.69)

(3.70)

(3.71)

the components of 3-form eld strength are the same as (3.61) due to the cancelation of
the rescale (3.68) and (3.69). thus the metric (3.58) reduce to the intersecting one and
the diamond shrinks.

we can see the eect of the transformation by using the duality relation [19]. since we
apply it along the transformed coordinates, the transformation correspond to changing
the direction of the compactication.

4 u-dualities

the (deformed) conifold geometry or ns5-branes congurations are related to other in-
teresting congurations by dualities. in this section we consider the consistency under
the dualities.

4.1 ns5-brane and d4-brane

we consider the type iib theory on the conifold. the t-duality along the x2 direction
take us the conguration of intersecting ns5-ns5 branes in the type iia theory whose
world-volume directions are

ns5 (0
ns5
(0

3 4

7 8 9)
5 6 7 8 9).

(4.1)

13

we rst lift the conguration to the m-theory and ip the x5 and x10 directions.

m5 (0
m5
(0

3 4

7 8 9

)

6 7 8 9 10).

(4.2)

we dimensionally reduce the x10 direction and have the intersecting ns5 and d4-branes
whose world-volume directions are

ns5 (0
(0
d4

3 4

7 8 9)
6 7 8 9)

(4.3)

in the type iia theory since one of m5-branes wraps on the compactied circle.

the d4-brane ends on the ns5-brane and each open d4-branes can slide along the
ns5-brane [21]. the shift of the open d4-branes in the (x3, x4) space corresponds to
the size of the diamond. this can be seen as follows. we introduce the holomorphic
coordinate x = x3 + i x4. let the position of the one of the open d4-branes on the x
plane be x = 0 and the other be x = m. in m-theory, these branes are described by the
m5-brane wrapping on the holomorphic curve [9]

x t + (x  m) = 0,

(4.4)

where t = e(x6+ix10)/r and r is a radius of the x10-direction. the curve (4.4) is the same
as the curve (2.6) with a holomorphic coordinate transformation, t  t  1. therefore
we nd that the squareroot of m corresponds to the size of the diamond .

this correspondence is generalized to intersecting n ns5-branes and m ns5-branes
in iia theory [11]. in this case, we have a generalized conifold (gmn : uv = xmyn) after
the t-duality along the overall transverse direction to the ns5 and ns5-branes. the
generalized conifold can be deformed to a smooth space by

uv =

n,m

xi,j=1

mijxi yj.

so, after the t-duality, we have the curve

n,m

0 =

mijxi yj

xi,j=1

= (mm nxm +    m0 n) yn + (mm n1xm +    m0 n1) yn1 +   

+(mm 0xm +    m0 0)

(4.5)

(4.6)

on which a single ns5-brane wraps. the parameters mij correspond to the locations of
the original ns5 and ns5-branes and the size of diamonds opened at each intersecting

14

points.
if we lift to the m-theory, we have a single m5-brane wrapping the seiberg-
witten curve which is the same as the curve (4.6). we have an n = 2 four-dimensional
su(m)n1 gauge theory with vanishing beta functions on d4-branes after the coordinate
ip and the dimensional reduction along the direction in originally the ns5-branes. the
matters consist of the (n  2) hypermultiplets in the bi-fundamental representation and
two hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of su(m), which come from the
semi-innite d4-branes in the left and right. thus the size of diamonds or locations of
ns5 and ns5-branes corresponds to the moduli parameters of the n = 2 gauge theory.
in fact the (m  1) + (n  1) relative branes positions and the size of diamonds at mn
intersection are mapped to (n  2) + 2m bare masses of hypermultiplets, (n  1)(m  1)
vevs of scalars in adjoint representation of the gauge groups su(m)n1 and n 1 complex
gauge coupling constants. since all beta-functions are zero, gauge coupling constants are
also moduli parameters. as a result, we have mn + m + n  2 parameters in total. this
number exactly agrees with the deformation parameter in eq.(4.5).

4.2 other u-dualities

let us consider the correspondence between the displacement of the ends of d4-branes
and the size of the diamond by using the ns5-brane with the diamond metric (3.58) .

we consider the following duality maps. first, we start with the conguration of

intersecting ns5 and d4-branes,

ns5 ( 0
( 0
d4

3 4

7 8 9 )
6 7 8 9 ).

(4.7)

secondly, the t-duality along the x7, x8 and x9-directions maps the conguration to

ns5 ( 0
( 0
d1

3 4

7 8 9 )
).

6

finally, we apply s-dual operation and and obtain

d5 ( 0
f 1 ( 0

3 4

7 8 9 )
).

6

(4.8)

(4.9)

it is shown in [22] that if there is the displacement of the two ends of the fundamental
string along the xi-direction on the d-brane, the displacement becomes a constant b-eld
after the t-duality along the direction. the relation of the displacement xi and the
component of the b-eld is given by

xi = bi6

15

(4.10)

where the fundamental string extends along the x6-direction. therefore if we take the
magnitude of the displacement along the x3, x4-directions as x3, x4 respectively, we have
components of the b-eld such that

b36 = x3
b46 = x4

(4.11)

after the t-duality along the x3 and x4-directions.

it is apparent that the displacement of the end points of d4-branes on the (x3, x4)
directions is the same as that of fundamental strings in the directions under the duality
map from the conguration (4.7) to (4.9). the diamond size corresponds to the b-eld
since the displacement x = m corresponds to it as we discussed in the previous subsection.
we conrm the observation by using the ns5-branes with a diamond metric (3.58) and
the duality relations given in [19]. we can also identify with the relation between the
parameter  and the size of the diamond.

we trace the duality chain (4.1)-(4.3), (4.8) and (4.9) and take the t-dualities to
the conguration (4.9) along the x3, x4 direction. applying the dualities relations to the
metric (3.58), we obtain

b36 =  cos 
b46 =  sin .

from (4.11) we have

x (= m) =  cos   i  sin .

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

therefore we nd that q|m| = q|| is the size of the diamond. the direction of the

displacement is rotated in the (x3, x4) directions at the angle . we conrm the discussion
in the sec 3.

5 conclusion and discussion

we start with the metric inspired by the deformed conifold metric, and obtain the ns5-
branes with the diamond metric which is smeared except for one of the overall transverse
directions. the metric is also obtained from the intersecting ns5-branes one by the trans-
formation (3.65) and (3.66). it means that the diamond is spread by the transformation.
the parameter  in the metric is the square of the size of the diamond and  is the
rotation angle on the plane over which originally one of intersecting ns5-branes extends.
the ns5-brane with the diamond relates to the ns5-brane and the d4-brane via string

16

dualities, where the d4-brane breaks on the ns5-brane. the displacement of the end
points is equal to .

the metric of ns5-branes with the diamond is delocalized and does not have local
information about the diamond. however we can get the information about the size of
the diamond because we assume that there is only one diamond. if there are more than
one diamond as in sec. 4.1, it is dicult to obtain information about each diamonds from
smeared metrics.

the partially localized solutions for the intersecting branes are obtained [23, 24, 25, 26].
the fully localized solution for a m5-brane wrapping a riemann surface is also discussed
in [24]. the fully localized solution is presented with a kahler potential, however, the
explicit form of the kahler potential is not known. in [27], the authors discuss the kahler
potential perturbatively for various types of intersecting branes and branes wrapping
curves, and nd that the perturbation theory is well behaved at least to the second order
if there are less than three overall transverse dimensions.

it is an interesting problem how the localized intersecting branes solutions can be
deformed and how the conifold or the deformed conifold relate to such solutions by the
duality map.
