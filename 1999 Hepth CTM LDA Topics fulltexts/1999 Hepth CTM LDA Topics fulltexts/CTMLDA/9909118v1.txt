abstract

we consider a two-dimensional integrable and conformally invariant eld theory
possessing two dirac spinors and three scalar elds. the interaction couples bilinear
terms in the spinors to exponentials of the scalars. its integrability properties are based
on the sl(2) ane kac-moody algebra, and it is a simple example of the so-called
conformal ane toda theories coupled to matter elds. we show, using bosonization
techniques, that the classical equivalence between a u (1) noether current and the
topological current holds true at the quantum level, and then leads to a bag model like
mechanism for the connement of the spinor elds inside the solitons. by bosonizing
the spinors we show that the theory decouples into a sine-gordon model and free
scalars. we construct the two-soliton solutions and show that their interactions lead
to the same time delays as those for the sine-gordon solitons. the model provides
a good laboratory to test duality ideas in the context of the equivalence between the
sine-gordon and thirring theories.

1 introduction

solitons are believed to have an important role in many non-perturbative aspects of a wide
class of quantum eld theories, as well as in condensed matter phenomena. the interest
is greater in lorentz invariant theories presenting topological solitons, since in many cases
there are strong evidence that such solitons correspond to particle excitations in the quantum
spectrum of the theory. the relevance of the solitons to non-perturbative phenomena comes,
in general, from the fact that their interactions are inversely proportional to the coupling
constants governing the dynamics of the fundamental elds appearing in the lagrangean.
therefore, the solitons are weakly coupled in the strong regime of the theory, and that is the
basic fact underlying several duality ideas. the reason is that one can describe the theory in
the strong coupling regime, by replacing the fundamental lagrangean by another one where
the excitations of its elds correspond to the solitonic states. the electromagnetic duality of
montonen-olive [1], involving magnetic monopoles and gauge particles, is the best example
of such behaviour, and has found in supersymmetric gauge theories the best habitat for its
implementation [2, 3, 4]. similar dualities occur in statistical mechanics models and many
lower dimensional eld theories. the example which is best understood in such context is
the quantum equivalence between the sine-gordon and thirring models [5, 6], which provide
an excellent laboratory to test ideas about the role of solitons in quantum eld theories.

in this paper we consider a two dimensional integrable and conformally invariant eld
theory involving spinor and scalar elds, and presenting topological solitons solutions. the
theory is one of the simplest examples of the so-called conformal ane toda models coupled
to matter elds proposed in [7]. it has two dirac spinors coupled to a scalar eld which
plays the role of a u(1) gauge particle. the system is made conformally invariant by the
introduction of two other scalar elds constituting what is in general called in the literature
a beta-gamma system, with non-positive denite kinetic term. the integrability of the
theory is established using a zero curvature formulation of its equations of motion based

on the bsl(2) ane kac-moody algebra. the general solution as well as explicit one-soliton

solutions have been obtained in [7]. besides the conformal and local gauge symmetries, the
model presents chiral symmetry and some discrete symmetries. however, one of its main
properties is that for a large subset of solutions there is an equivalence between the u(1)
noether gauge current, involving the spinors only, and the topological current associated to
the scalar gauge particle. that fact was stablished in [7] at the classical level, and has
profound consequences in the properties of the theory.
it implies that the density of the
u(1) charge has to be concentrated in the regions where the scalar eld has non vanishing
space derivative, i.e. presents large momenta modes. the one-soliton of the theory is of the
sine-gordon type, and therefore the charge density is concentrated inside the soliton. since
the charge carriers are the spinors, it means that if one looks for excitations of the theory
around the solitonic state, one would expect the spinors to be conned.

one of the main objectives of this paper is to study the equivalence of the noether
and topological currents at the quantum level, and its consequences for the connement
mechanism. the rst thing to be established is if such equivalence is not spoiled by quantum
anomalies the currents may present. fortunately, that issue can be established exactly by
using, instead of perturbative approaches, bosonization techniques following the lines of [8].

1

by bosonizing the spinor eld we show that the sector of the theory made of the spinor and
gauge particles is equivalent to a theory of a free massless scalar and a sine-gordon eld. in
addition, the condition for the equivalence of the noether and topological currents is simply
the condition that the free massless scalar should be constant. therefore, by performing
a quantum reduction where the excitations of the free scalar are eliminated, we obtain a
submodel where the equivalence of those currents holds true exactly at the quantum level,
proving that there are no anomalies. consequently, we show that in such reduced theory the
connement of the spinor particles does take place.

an important property of the model under consideration is that it possesses another
type of spinor particle. that is obtained by fermionizing the sine-gordon eld using the
well known equivalence between the sine-gordon and massive thirring models [5, 6].
in
that scenario the solitons of the sine-gordon model are interpreted as the spinor particles
of the thirring theory. we are then lead to an interesting analogy with what one expects
to happen in qcd. the original spinor particles of our model that get conned inside the
solitons play the role of the quarks, and the second spinor particle (thirring), which are
the solitons, play the role of the hadrons. the u(1) noether charge is also conned and
is analogous to color in qcd. in this sense, our model constitute an excellent laboratory
to test ideas about connement, the role of solitons in quantum eld theory, and dualities
interchanging the role of solitons and fundamental particles.

we also constructed the one-soliton and two-soliton solutions for our theory using two
techniques: the dressing transformations and the hirotas method. we use the zero cur-
vature representation of the equations of motion with potentials taking value on the ane

kac-moody algebra bsl(2) (see appendix). then the basic idea is to look for vacuum con-
gurations where the potentials lie in an abelian (up to central terms) subalgebra of bsl(2).

that constitutes in fact an algebra of oscillators. the solitons are obtained by performing
the dressing tranformations from those vacuum congurations with group elements which
are exponentiations of the eigenvectors of the oscillators [9, 10, 11]. such procedure leads
quite naturally to the denition of tau-functions [9], and then the hirotas method can be
easily implemented too. we discuss the conditions for the solutions to be real, and evaluate
the topological charges. the interactions of the solitons is studied by calculating their time
delays. it is attractive, in fact the time delays are the same as those for the sine-gordon
solitons. an interesting aspect of the solutions is that when the two dirac spinors of the
theory are related by a reality condition, then either the soliton or the anti-soliton disappears
from the spectrum. we interpret that as indicative of the existence of a duality involving
the solitons and the spinor particles.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we summarize the properties of the model,
introduced in [7], at the classical level. in section 3 we consider the correponding quantum
eld theory and show, using bosonization techniques, the equivalence of the noether and
topological currents as well as the connement mechanism. the soliton solutions and their
interaction (time delays) are studied in section 4. in the appendix we give the zero curvature
representation for the model under consideration.

the theory (2.1) was proposed in [7] as an example of a wide class of integrable theories
called ane toda systems coupled to matter elds1. the zero curvature representation, the
construction of the general solution including the solitonic ones and many other properties
were discussed in [7]. in the appendix a we summarize some of those results. here, we want
to discuss some special features of that theory at the quantum level as well as the two-soliton
solutions. we start by reviewing the symmetries of (2.1).

satisfying

(2.19)
notice, from (2.9), that the currents j and j have conformal weights (1, 0) and (0, 1)
respectively. one can now perform a (hamiltonian) reduction of the model by imposing the
constraints

j = 0 ;

+ j = 0

j = 0 ;

j = 0

(2.20)

the degree of freedom eliminated by such reduction does not correspond to the excitations
of any of the elds appearing in the lagragian (2.1). as we show below, it corresponds to
the excitations of a free eld which is a non-linear combination of those in (2.1).

one can easily check that the constraints (2.20) are equivalent to

(2.21)

therefore, in the reduced model, the noether current (2.13) is proportional to the topological
current (2.16).

that fact has profound consequences in the properties of such theory. for instance,

it implies (taking e to be the complex conjugate of ) that the charge density  is

proportional to the space derivative of . consequently, the dirac eld is conned to live
in regions where the eld  is not constant. the best example of that is the one-soliton
solution of (2.1) which was calculated in [7] and it is given by

(2.22)

and the solution for e is the complex conjugate of . notice that, from (2.16), one indeed

has qtopol. = 1 for the solution (2.22)5.

notice that the solution for  is exactly the sine-gordon soliton, and therefore x is
non-vanishing only in a region of size of the order of m1
 . in addition, the solution for 
satises the massive thirring model equations of motion [12]. one can check that (2.22)
satises (2.21), and so is a solution of the reduced model. therefore, the dirac eld must
be conned inside the soliton. one can verify that (2.22) indeed conrms that fact.

we point out that the condition (2.21) together with the equations of motion for the
dirac spinors (2.6)-(2.7) imply the equation of motion for , namely (2.3). therefore in the
reduced model, dened by the constraints (2.20), one can replace a second order dierential
equation, i.e. (2.3), by two rst order equations, i.e. (2.21).

5notice that we have dened the topological charge in (2.16) as twice that of the reference [7], in order

to make it integer.

one could think of equating the chiral current (2.15) to a topological current associated
to a scalar eld. however, the equations of motion imply that such a scalar has to be a free
eld. therefore, one could consider a submodel of (2.1) dened by the constraints

   = 5 +

(2.23)

where  is a parameter. one can check that such constraints are compatible with the
equations of motion. however, we will not use that observation in what follows.

3 the quantum theory

the results discussed above are true at the classical level. the question we address now is
if they remain true at the quantum level, an the connement of the dirac spinor does take
place. the answer is armative, and can be obtained quite elegantly using bosonization
methods [5, 6]. witten has considered a similar model in [8], originally proposed by kogut
and sinclair [13], and we shall use his methods. their model diers from (2.1) in three points:
i) it does not contain the pair of elds (, ), and therefore is not conformally invariant; ii)
the sign of the kinetic term of the  eld in (2.1) is ipped with respect to their corresponding
term; iii) their model possesses just one dirac spinor.

in the considerations about the quantum theory, to be made in this section, we shall
impose the reality condition (2.2) and consequently the lagrangian (2.1) will depend on the
real constant e. therefore, in this section we have  = 0.

we introduce a new boson eld c by bosonizing the dirac spinor  as [8, 14]

impose

clearly, in the limit e  /2,  becomes a massless free eld.
we now discuss the quantum version of the reduction (2.20). since et (1  5)  =

j = q| 4  8e |

(3.11)

therefore, the constraints (2.20) are equivalent to  = const., and consequently the degree
of freedom elimaneted by them corresponds to the  eld.

the reduction at the quantum level can be realized as follows. since the scalar eld 
is decoupled from all others elds in the theory (3.8), we can denote the space of states as
h = h  h0, where h is the fock space of the free massless scalar , and h0 carries the
states of the rest of the theory. we shall denote  = (+) +(), where (+) (()) corresponds
to the part containing annihilation (creation) operators in its expansion on plane waves. the
reduction corresponds to the restriction of the theory to those states satisfying

by taking the complex conjugate one gets

(+) | i = 0

h | () = 0

(3.12)

(3.13)

and consequently the expectation value of  vanishes on such states. indeed, if | i and
| i are two states satisfying (3.12), then

h |  | i = h | () + (+) | i = 0

(3.14)

that provides the correspondence with the classical constraints (2.20). therefore, the hilbert
space of the reduced theory is hc =| i  h0.
7

for the theory described by hc, the equivalence between noether and topological cur-
rents, given by (2.21), holds true at the quantum level, since as we have shown before,
(2.21) is equivalent to the vanishing of the currents j and j . notice that such quantum
equivalence is exact, since we have not used perturbative or semiclassical methods.
one of the consequences of that quantum equivalence is that in the states of hc, like
the one-soliton (2.22), where the the space derivative of  is localized6, one has that the
spinor  is conned, since from (2.21), hxi  hi. therefore, we have shown that the
connement of  does take place in the quantum theory.
notice that the quantum reduction (3.12) does not violate the conformal symmetry of the
lagrangian (3.8), because we are not restricting to a non vanishing constant, the expectation
value of any quantity of non vanishing conformal weight.

the theory described by (3.8) is certainly non-unitary because the kinetic terms have in
general dierent signs, and so the energy is unbounded from below7. the reduction (3.12)
eliminates part of the problem, since the kinetic energy associated to the  eld vanishes in
hc. there remains the non-unitarity associated with the system (, ). we can perform a
further reduction by restricting ourselves to those states of h0 satisfying

(+) | 0i = 0

(3.15)

where we have denoted the free eld  as  = (+)+(), with (+) (()) corresponding to the
part containing annihilation (creation) operators in the expansion in terms of plane waves.
consequently, using similar arguments as before, the expectation value of  vanishes on
such states,

(3.16)

(3.17)

in addition, it follows that

h0 |  | 0i = 0

h0 | e | 0i = const.
notice that the operator e has conformal weights(cid:16) 1

2 , 1

2(cid:17), and since it is present in the

lagrangian (3.8), it follows that such reduction does break the conformal symmetry. such
breaking of symmetry resembles the higgs mechanism since it generates mass for the  eld,
and that is proportional to the expectation value of e [15].

after the reductions (3.12) and (3.15), the  eld decouples and we are left with a unitary
theory which is that of the sine-gordon model of the  eld. in fact, as coleman has shown
[5], the sine-gordon theory is unbounded below if 2 > 8. therefore, from (3.9) we have
to have

2 < 8



k > |   2e |

2

(3.18)

an important property of the model under consideration is that it presents another spinor
eld which is not conned. indeed, using bosonization rules again, we can introduce a spinor
 as

i :  : =

(3.23)

therefore, we get a thirring model coupled to  plus the free scalar eld . after the
reductions (3.12) and (3.15) the theory becomes the pure massive thirring model. notice
that  becomes a free massive spinor [5] for 2 = 4 or k =|   2e | /.
the properties of the theory (2.1) at the quantum level are quite remarkable. in the weak
couling regime, i.e. small k, the excitations around the vacuum correspond to the spinor 
and the gaugeparticle . the u(1) symmetry (2.12) is not broken and the charged states
correspond to the  particles. consider now those states satisfying (3.12) and look for the
uctuations around the state corresponding, for instance, to the one-soliton solution (2.22).
the  particles disappear from the spectrum since they are conned inside the soliton. the
 particles can live outside the soliton only in bound states with vanishing u(1) charge.
the theory, however, presents another spinor particle corresponding to the excitations of the
thirring eld , which have zero u(1) charge. however, according to colemans interpre-
tation of the sine-gordon/thirring equivalence, such excitations correspond to the solitons
themselves. therefore, we can make an analogy with what is expected to happen in qcd.
the  and  particles are like the quarks and hadrons respectively. the u(1) charge is
analogous to color in qcd, since it is also conned.

another important point, rst observed in [8], is that although the theory (2.1) presents
the chiral symmetry (2.14), it does present massive spinor states. the reason is quite simple
and elegant. using the bosonization rule (3.3) and the eld redenitions (3.6), one gets that
the chiral current (2.15) can be written as

5 =s|   2e |

2

j 



(3.24)

therefore, the spinor  does not contribute to such current and so has zero chirality. there-
fore, the fact that it does acquire a mass is not incompatible with the chiral symmetry. the
spinor with non zero chirality is  and it disappears from the spectrum in the conning sec-
tor of the theory. the possibility of having chiral symmetry and massive fermions is another
remarkable property of the theory (2.1).

for these reasons the model (2.1) constitute an excellent laboratory to test ideas about
connement, the role of solitons in quantum eld theories, and duality transformations in-
terchanging the role of solitons and fundamental particles. with that motivation we shall
now study the two-soliton solutions and their interactions.

9

4 soliton solutions

it is well known the relevance of localized classical solutions of non-linear relativistic eld
equations to the corresponding quantum theories. in particular, solitons can be associated
with quantum extended-particle states. therefore, we will examine the classical soliton
type solutions to get insight into the quantum spectrum of the model, in much the same
way of what is already known in the remarkable sine-gordon model. we argue that, at the
classical level, the solutions for the  and  elds share some features of the sine-gordon and
the massive thirring theories, respectively. we have shown in the previous section, using
bosonization methods, that at the quantum level the theory (2.1) is equivalent to (3.8).
however, the space of classical solutions of the two theories are not the same. one can not
use (3.1)-(3.3), at the classical level, as change of variables to relate classical solutions of one
theory to those of the other. the bosonization rules (3.1)-(3.3) are purely quantum relations.
the one-soliton solutions of (2.1) have been calculated in [7] using the dressing transfor-
mation method. here, we construct the two-soliton solutions using the same methods. we
start with the zero curvature representation of the equations of motion of the theory

where the indices  stand for the light cone variables x = t  x. for the theory (2.1)
the connections a live on the bsl(2) ane kac-moody algebra g, and are given in the
appendix a (see (a.1)). since (4.1) imply the connections must be at, one can write them
as a = t t 1, with t being a group element obtained by exponentiating g. in addition,
using an integral gradation of g, i.e. g = n gn, n  zz, one can perform a generalized gauss
decomposition of the element t t 1, with  being a given constant group element. denote
by g<0, g0 and g>0 the subalgebras generated by elements of grades negative, zero and
positive respectively. then

t t 1 =(cid:16)t t 1(cid:17)<0 (cid:16)t t 1(cid:17)0 (cid:16)t t 1(cid:17)>0

(4.2)

where (t t 1)<0, (t t 1)0 and (t t 1)>0 are elements belonging to subgroups whose
algebras are g<0, g0 and g>0 respectively. one now introduces

t 

(4.3)

t  (cid:16)t t 1(cid:17)>0

t =(cid:16)t t 1(cid:17)1

0 (cid:16)t t 1(cid:17)1

<0

such relation denes a transformation on the connections

a = t t 1



 = t  t 1
a

(4.4)

which preserves their grading structure. therefore, if one knows a solution t for the zero
curvature one obtains a new solution t , determined by the constant group element . we
point out that the fact that the transformed element t  can be written in two dierent ways
as in (4.3) plays a crucial role in the dressing method. it guarantees that the transformed
connection is in the same gauge as the original one, and therefore allows to translate the
dressing transformation (4.4) into transformation of the physical elds dening the theory.

a quite general procedure to construct soliton solutions in integrable theories, using such
dressing transformations, is described in [9]. it constitutes a generalization of the so-called
solitonic specialization in the context of the leznov-saveliev solution for toda type models
[10, 11, 16]. one starts by looking for a vacuum solution such that the connections a,
when evaluated on it, belong to an algebra of oscillators, i.e. an abelian (up to central
terms) subalgebra of the kac-moody algebra. one then looks for the eigenvectors vi, in g,
of such oscillators. the solitons belong to the orbits of solutions obtained by the dressing
transformation performed by elements of the form  = evi1 evi2 . . . evin .

for the theory (2.1) we perform the dressing transformation starting from the vacuum

the relations (4.19)-(4.24) are the hirotas bilinear equations [17] for the model (2.1). notice
that the rst order equations (4.17) and (4.21)-(4.24) imply that the dierence of (4.19) and
(4.20) should be satised, but not that each one separately should do.

the n-soliton solutions are constructed by taking the constant group element  of the
dressing transformation to be a product of exponentials of the eigenvectors of e2 (see
(4.9)). since v+(z) and v(z) have the same eigenvalue, we take the exponential of a
linear combination of them, i.e.

nsol

with

v (a(l)

 , zl) 

i(cid:16)a(l)

+ v+(zl) + a(l)

 v(zl)(cid:17) ;

(4.25)

in fact, if for a given l (or more than one) either a(l)
 vanishes one does not obtain n-
soliton solutions. for example, in the case of the one-soliton one gets a vanishing solution for
 [7]. the fact that the n-soliton solutions need the two degenerate eigenvectors, i.e. v+(z)
and v(z), is what makes them to carry, besides the topological charge, the electric u(1)
charge (2.13).

with l = 1, and so from (4.27)

(4.30)

an important point in the calculations involved in the construction of the soliton solutions
is that it is much easier to work with the homogeneous (or fubini-veneziano) vertex operator
construction for v(z). indeed, in such construction one has that8

v (z) v ()  0 ,
and therefore the exponentials involving v (z) truncate.

4.1 the one-soliton solutions

the one-soliton solution can easily be calculated by evaluating the matrix elements (4.12)
with  = ev (a,z), or alternatively by applying the hirotas method to the equations (4.19)-
(4.24). the result is

(4.34)

one can check that such solutions also satisfy (4.17) without any further restriction. there-
fore, the one-soliton solution satisfy the condition (2.21) for the equivalence between noether
and topological currents.

if one requires that  should be real, then one gets from (4.32) and (4.35) that (a a+)
must be real. such condition is sucient to make 1 = 0 . therefore, using (2.16) and
(4.33), one gets that the topological charge of the soliton is

qtopol. =  sign (a a+)
qtopol. = sign (a a+)

for z > 0
for z < 0

(4.36)

however, if one imposes in addition, the reality condition (2.2) on the spinors one gets

from (4.35) that the parameters must satisfy

the topological charge in such case is

a = e a+ z

qtopol. = sign e

for any real z

(4.37)

(4.38)

notice that in general, solitons are transformed into anti-solitons by parity transfor-
mations. however, the theory (2.1) is not invariant under spatial parity, and the cp-like

14

in order to have
symmetry (2.17) is broken when the reality condition (2.2) is imposed.
a degenerate vacua and topological solitons we need the factor i in the exponential of the
potential term in (2.1). that makes the lagrangian complex and so it is very unlikely that
(2.1) has a cpt symmetry. the lack of p, cp and cpt symmetries is what rearms the
existence of only the soliton or anti-soliton solution for a given choice of e in (2.2).

we then reach an interesting conclusion: without the reality condition (2.2) the theory
(2.1) has two dirac spinors and it also has the soliton and anti-soliton solutions, since
according to (4.36) both signs of the charge are admissible. however, if we impose the
reality condition (2.2) the theory (2.1) looses one dirac spinor and also one soliton solution,
since for a given choice of e one observes from (4.38) that only one topological charge
(corresponding to soliton or anti-soliton) is permitted. that is indicative of the existence of
some sort of duality between solitons and spinor particles.

the particular one-soliton solution (2.22) satises (4.37) with e = 1, z > 0,  being the

phase of a+, i.e. a+ =| a+ | ei, and | a+ | z/2 = exp(cid:16)mx0/1  v2(cid:17).

the mass of these one-soliton solutions was evaluated in [7] and it is given by

where k is the coupling constant appearing in the lagrangian (2.1).

m = 2 k m

(4.39)

4.2 the two-soliton solutions

the two-soliton solutions are calculated through the dressing transformation method taking
(see (4.25))

2sol  ev (a(1)

 ,z1) ev (a(2)

 ,z2)

and so

g2sol = e(e(z1)v (a(1)

 ,z1)) e(e(z2)v (a(2)

 ,z2))

(4.40)

the explicit solution is calculated by evaluating the matrix elements (4.12). alternatively,
one can apply hirotas expansion method [17] to the hirotas equation (4.19)-(4.24). the

as we have said the lorentz transformations in 2d are x  x  1 x. the corre-
sponding eld transformations can be obtained from (2.8)-(2.9) by taking f (x+) = x+ and
g (x) = 1x. therefore, choosing the conformal weight  of the eld  to vanish, one
conclude from (4.10)-(4.11) that, under lorentz transformations, the tau-functions transform
as

and similarly for er/l. one then observes that such tranformations can be implemented in

the space of solutions by transforming the parameters of the solutions (4.41)-(4.46) as

4.3 the reality conditions

we want z1 and z2 real in order for the soliton velocities to be smaller than the speed of light
(c = 1, see (4.28)). then, one can easily check that in order for the solutions (4.41)-(4.42)

to satisfy (4.32) one has to have a(1)

 and a(2)
+ a(2)
a(i)
 = i | a(i)

+ a(i)

(4.53)

(4.54)

the relations (4.51) and (4.52) are the necessary and sucient conditions for (4.32) to
be satised. however, they are sucient to make 1 the complex conjugate of 0. therefore,

 = 



1 = 0



 = 20 + n

(4.55)

consequently, the conditions (4.34) become

one can easily check that the solutions (4.41)-(4.46) satisfy the conditions 1 = 0 (and so
 real) and (4.56) if the parameters satisfy (z1, z2 being real)

er = ie r ,

el = ie l

i = 1, 2

(4.56)

(4.57)

(4.58)

a(i)
 = e a(i)
then it follows that the signs of zi and a(i)

+

zi

+ a(i)

 are related by

i = i sign e

i = 1, 2

which indeed satisfy (4.53).

4.4 the topological charges

for the solutions satisfying the conditions (4.51) and (4.52) we shall denote

| a(i)

+ | | a(i)

 | e2ix(i)

0

i = 1, 2

(4.59)

with i dened in (4.28). we then dene

 (zi)   (zi)  ix(i)

0

(4.60)

with  (zi) being dened in (4.27).

in order to evaluate the topological charges we shall take the solution in the center of

mass reference frame, which corresponds to (see (4.28) and (4.29))

z1 = 1e ;

z2 = 2e ,


17

v1 = v2

and 2 = 1 2 1

(4.61)

then, using (4.51), (4.54), (4.61), and (4.49), the tau-function 0 given in (4.41) becomes

0 = 1  12(cid:16)1e  2e(cid:17)

(e + 12e)2 sin (1  2) e(z1)+(z2)

(4.62)

in addition, one has 1 = 0 , when (4.53) is also enforced. therefore, according to (2.16)
and (4.55), the topological charge is qtopol. = 2
 (arg 0 ()  arg 0 ()). we shall use the
prescription that the arg 0 lies between  and . when evaluating the charge one should
notice that, on the center of mass reference frame, (z1) + (z2) does not depend upon x if
1 and 2 have opposite signs. in addition, for 12 = 12 = 1 one should pay attention on
the sign of the imaginary part of 0 as it tends to zero, in order to determine if arg 0 tends
to  or . in such case, one can write
cos (1  2)

for 12 = 12 = 1. since cos(12)
in fact, the
topological charge, for  real, does not depend upon the phases i. the results one obtains
are

cosh   1, the limit is independent of i.

qtopol. = 21
qtopol. = 21

for (1 = 2 = 1, 12 = 1) or (1 = 2 = 1, 12 = 1)
for (1 = 2 = 1, 12 = 1) or (1 = 2 = 1, 12 = 1)

(4.64)

if one now imposes the reality condition (2.2) on the spinors, or equivalently (4.56)-(4.58),

one gets

qtopol. = 2 sign e

(4.65)

for any i and i satisfying (4.58).

we then have a situation similiar to the one-soliton solutions, since in that case the
imposition of the condition (2.2) makes either the soliton or anti-soliton to disappear from
the spectrum. here the same thing happens, since (2.2) chooses the sign of e and then
either the charge 2 or 2 solutions disapear. however, a new feature emerges. we saw we
could have (without (2.2)) soliton and anti-soliton solutions with  real. we have not found
here a charge zero solution corresponding to the scattering of a soliton and anti-soliton for 
real. such solution exists however, for  complex but asymptotically real as we show below.

4.4.1 asymptotically real solutions

one can easily verify that for the solutions (4.41)-(4.46) the eld  is always real asymptot-

ically, i.e. | 0 || 1 | as x  . in addition, one also has that , e  0 as x  .

therefore, the topological charge is always real for those solutions.

18

let us now consider a solution of the type (4.41)-(4.46) that satises the conditions (4.51)
and (4.54) but not (4.53) (and of course not (2.2) too). in the center of mass reference frame
(see (4.61)) 0 is given by (4.62) and 1 by

(4.66)

since | 0 |=| 1 | holds true asymptotically, the topological charge is then given by
qtopol. = 1
 ((arg 0  arg 1) ()  (arg 0  arg 1) ()). again, using the prescription
that the argument of i varies from  to , one gets that

qtopol. = 0

for (12 = 1, 12 = 1) or (12 = 1, 12 = 1)

(4.67)

therefore, such solution corresponds to the scattering of a soliton and a anti-soliton.

4.5 the breather solutions

the space-time dependence of the solutions (4.41)-(4.46) are given through the exponentials
exp (l (x  vlt)), l = 1, 2. therefore, in order to have solutions periodic in time one needs
lvl to be pure imaginary. writing zl =| zl | eil, one observes from (4.28) that for that to
happen one needs | zl |= 1, and so lvl = im sin l. in order for the solution to present
just one frequency one needs to have sin 2 =  sin 1. we do not want z1 = z2 because
(4.41)-(4.46) becomes a one-soliton solution. in addition, we do not want z1 = z2 because
the solution (4.41)-(4.46) will present singularities. therefore, the only possibilities of having
solutions periodic in time is to have

then one gets from (4.27) and (4.28) that

z1 = ei ;

z2 =  ei ;

 = 1

with

 (z1) = x + it

 (z2) =  (x  it)

  m cos 

  m sin 

(4.68)

(4.69)

(4.70)

4.5.1 the case  = 1
we are interested in the cases where the eld  is real, and so from (4.10) we need | 0 |=| 1 |.
imposing the conditions (4.68)-(4.70) into (4.41)-(4.42) one observes that in order for  to
be real one needs

+ a(1)

 (cid:17)

a(2)
+ a(2)

 =(cid:16)a(1)

and

n  zz

(4.71)

(4.72)

where we have denoted

a(i)
 | a(i)

 | ei(i)



i = 1, 2

(4.73)

it follows that the conditions (4.71) and (4.72) are sucient to make 1 = 0 , and from

(4.41) one gets

0 = 1 + (1)n+1 s (cid:18)r 
cos  (cid:18)r +

where the integer n is the same as in (4.72), and we have introduced

4 | a(1)

+ || a(1)

 | ;

r  | a(1)
+ |
| a(2)

(4.74)

(4.75)

therefore, using (2.16) and (4.10) one gets that the topological charge of such breather

solution is

with n given by (4.72).

qtopol. = 2 (1)n+1

(4.76)

now, if besides the reality of , one imposes the condition (2.2) on the spinors, one gets

that the parameters have to satisfy

a(1)
 = e a(2)

+

 ei ;

a(2)
 = e a(1)

+

 ei

(4.77)

which to be compatible with (4.71) and (4.72), one needs exp(cid:16)i(cid:16) + (1)

then, the topological charge becomes

+ + (2)

 (cid:17)(cid:17) = sign e.

qtopol. = 2 sign e

(4.78)

consequently, we have for the breather solutions an eect similar to what happens in the
two-soliton solutions (see discussions below (4.38) and (4.65)). for  real we have breathers
with topological charges 2. however, if one imposes the reality condition (2.2) on the
spinors, one gets that only one charge is allowed.

4.5.2 the case  = 1
one can check that for the choice  = 1 in (4.68) one can not obtain non trivial solutions
such that  is real. however, one does have that  is asymptotically real. it is quite easy to
verify that the topological charge vanishes for any choice of the parameters a(i)

 . so,

qtopol. = 0 ;

for  = 1, and any a(i)

 , i = 1, 2

(4.79)

4.6 the time delays

solitons are classical solutions that travel with constant speed without dispersion and that
keep their form under scattering, the eect of it being only a phase shift or a displacement
in its position. we now show that the solitons we have been working with are true solitons
and indeed fulll the above requirements. we shall calculate the so-called time delays of the
scattering of two solitons, using the procedures of [20].

we consider two solitons that in the distant past are well apart, then colide near t = 0
and then separate again in the distant future. therefore, except for the region where the
scattering occurs, the solitons are free and so travel with constant velocity. let us denote
the trajectories of one of the solitons before and after the collision as (since the velocity is
the same)

the lateral displacement at xed time is measured by

x = vt + x(i)

and

x = vt + x(f )

the time delay is dened by

(x)  x(f )  x(i)

(t)  t(f )  t(i) = 

(x)

v

(4.80)

(4.81)

(4.82)

with the intercepts of the trajectories with the time axis being given by t(f ) = x(f )/v
and t(i) = x(i)/v. the lateral displacement and the time delay are not lorentz invariant,
and so we consider the invariant
(4.83)

e(x) = p(t)

with e and p = ve being the energy and momentum of the soliton respectively. since e
is positive it follows (x) has the same sign in any reference frame, with only its strength
being frame dependent. the time delay on the other hand may change the sign under lorentz
transformations. one can show that the lateral displacements and time delays for the two
solitons participating in the collision have to satisfy [20]

e11(x) + e22(x) = 0 ;

p11(t) + p22(t) = 0

(4.84)

2

2

(t) = (comf)

(t). therefore, from (4.83) we have that e(comf)

with the sub-indices i labeling the quantities associated to particle i. notice therefore that,
since the energies are positive, the lateral displacements have opposite signs. clearly, in
the center of momentum frame (comf), where p1 + p2 = 0, the time delays are equal,
i.e. (comf)
(x)/p1 =
e(comf)
(t). consequently, since (x) has the same
sign in any frame, it follows that, if particle 1 moves to the right faster then particle 2 (such
that p1 is positive in the cmof), then (1(x)), 2(x), (comf)
(t) all have the
same sign. the physical interpretation of that sign is related to the character (attractive
or repulsive) of the interaction forces. indeed, if the force is attractive then particle 1 will
accelerate as it approaches particle 2 and then decelerate. that means that 1(x) is positive
and so the common sign negative. therefore, attractive forces lead to a negative time delay

(t) = (comf)

(x)/p1 = (comf)

(t) and (comf)

in the center of momentum reference frame, and clearly repulsive forces a positive time delay.
these considerations assume that the two particles pass through each other, and there is no
reection. however, when the masses of the two particles are equal there is the possibility
of occurring reection.

let us now evaluate the time delays for the two-soliton solutions given in (4.41)-(4.46).
we choose the particle 1 to move faster to the right than particle 2, i.e. v1 > v2, with v1 > 0,
and therefore from (4.28) and (4.29) | z1 |<| z2 | or 1 < 2. we then track the soliton 1 in
time [20], i.e. we hold x v1t xed as time varies. then one gets x v2t = const. + (v1 v2)t,
with const. = x  v1t. we then get that, if 2 = 1, e2(z2)  0 as t  , and e2(z2)  
as t  . for the case 2 = 1 the limits get interchanged.
therefore, taking 2 = 1, one can check that the solution (4.41)-(4.46) becomes, in the
limit t  , the one-soliton solution (4.35) with the identications a(1)
  a and z1  z.
now, in the limit t  , one can also verify that the ratios 0/1, r/0, l/1, er/1
and el/0 for the solutions (4.41)-(4.46) tend to the corresponding ratios for the one-soltion

solution (4.35) with the same identication of parameters, and with the replacement

e1(z1) (cid:18) z1  z2
z1 + z2(cid:19)2

e1(z1)

(4.85)

the only dierence being the fact that the ratio 0/1 gets a relative minus sign, meaning that
the  eld gets shifted by  (see (4.10)) during the scattering process. then one observes
from (4.10)-(4.11) that the relevant eect of the scattering on the solutions for the elds ,

 and e is a lateral displacement of the soliton 1 given by

1 (x  v1t)  1 x  v1t +

ln(cid:18)z1  z2

z1 + z2(cid:19)2!

1
1

(4.86)

if one takes 2 = 1 instead, one observes that the direction of the arrow in (4.86) reverses.
therefore, using (4.81), (4.28) and (4.29) one sees that the lateral displacement for the soliton
1 is given by

1(x) = 

12

m cosh 1

e(12)/2 + 12e(12)/2!2
ln  e(12)/2  12e(12)/2

(4.87)

(4.88)

since 12 = 1, one observes that 1(x) is in fact independent of such signs, and so

1(x) = 

1

m cosh 1

ln tanh 1  2

2 !!2

notice that the solutions (4.41)-(4.46) are symmetric under the interchange of the indices 1
and 2 of the parameters a(i)
 and zi. therefore, if we track the soliton 2, i.e. keep x  v2t
xed as time varies, but under the same kinematical conditions, i.e. v1 > v2, with v1 > 0,
then we obtain that

2(x) =

1

m cosh 2

ln tanh  1  2

2 !!2

(4.89)

if we reverse the kinematical conditions, i.e. take v2 > v1, with v2 > 0, then the signs of
both i(x), i = 1, 2, reverse. the mass of the one-soliton solutions is given in (4.39), and

22

therefore the energies of the solitons are ei = 2 k m cosh i, i = 1, 2. consequently, one
sees that the i(x)s do indeed satisfy (4.84), i.e.

e11(x) = e22(x) = sign (v1  v2) 2 k ln tanh  1  2

2 !!2

(4.90)

in addition, using (4.82), (4.88) and (4.89) one gets that the time delays are given by (as-
suming v1 > v2, with v1 > 0)

1

m sinh 2

m sinh 1

; 2(t) =

1(t) = 

2 !!2

ln tanh  1  2

2 !!2
(4.91)
notice that the hyperbolic tangent varies from 1 to 1 and therefore the logarithm of its
square is always negative, and so from (4.88) one sees that 1(x) for v1 > v2, with v1 > 0, is
positive. therefore, from the considerations made above we conclude that the forces between
the solitons is attractive. in addition, it is independent of their topological charges. in fact,
the time delays we have obtained coincide with those of the sine-gordon theory by identifying
k with a positive constant multiplied by the inverse of the square of the sine-gordon coupling
constant.
