we point out that a recent analysis by cadoni and mignemi on the statistical entropy of 2d
black holes has a serious error in identifying the virasoro algebra which invalidates its principal
claims.

recently cadoni and mignemi [1] presented a microscopical derivation of the entropy of
the two-dimensional (2d) black holes. they have shown that the canonical algebra of the
asymptotic symmetry of 2d anti-de sitter (ads) space included the virasoro algebra. using
this algebra and the cardys formula they obtained the statistical entropy which agreed, up to
a factor of 2, with the thermodynamical result. in this comment, we point out that their
analysis has a serious error which invalidates its principal claims.

let us consider the problem in detail. the authors object was obtaining the microscopic
derivation of the entropy of the 2d black holes in ads space [2] from the microstate counting
procedure of the three-dimensional ads space a la brown-henneaux [3] and strominger [4]
(bhs). in this approach, it is a basic ingredient that there is the innite-dimensional conformal
symmetry, for some (innitely large or nite) boundaries, which is described by the virasoro
algebra with the classical central charge [3, 5]. it is the strategy to apply the cardys formula
for the asymptotic density of states to obtain the microscopic entropy though the true validity
of the formula may be debatable [6].

as the simplest example of the 2d gravity theory that admits 2d black hole solution in
ads space they considered the jackiw-teitelboim model [7, 2]. using the regge-teitelboim
procedure [8], they obtained the dierentiable, which means no boundary terms in the eld
variation, hamiltonian

h[] =z dx(h + khx) + j[]

for the surface deformation parameters  = nt, k = x+n xt with the lapse, shift functions
n, n x and the killing vectors t, x along the tangent vectors /t, /x respectively. here,
note that the boundary charge j[] is dened only at a boundary point, x  , and no other
integration variables present. with this hamiltonian, the central charge are read o usually
from the dirac bracket algebra [3]

{j[], j[]}db = j[[, ]] + c(, )

or from the variation of j[] under the surface deformations

j[] = j[[, ]] + c(, )

(1)

(2)

with the surface deformation lie bracket [, ] [3] and its corresponding central term c(, ).
[the dirac bracket for the dynamical variables a, b is dened usually as {a, b}db = {a, b}
{a, }c 1
{, b} with the second-class constraints (detc 6= 0, c  {, }) and the
inverse of c , c 1
in our case of (1), it is implicitly assumed that the gauge-xing
conditions f  0 are introduced to make the (rst-class) energy and momentum constraints
h  0,hx  0 become the second-class constraints set  = {h,hx, f}.]

 [9].

but there are serious mismatches [10] with our purpose: a) because the algebra is dened
only at one (boundary) point there is no room for the innite tower of symmetry generators
through the fourier-series expansion of the algebra as required in the bhs procedure. b) j[]
is time-dependent in general which means that j[] is not conserved quantity. this is contrast
to the usual fact that j[] is a (boundary part of) conserved noether charge [5]. moreover, the
algebra and the central term c(, ) are now time-dependent and eventually time-dependent

entropy would be expected s  qc(, ) according to the cardys formula [1, 6] in general.

in order to resolve this unwanted situation they introduced the time-integrated charge j

j[] =



2z 2/

0

dtj[]

(3)

with time period of 2/ and they obtained a virasoro algebra in the asymptotic symmetry
algebra of 2d black holes. but this procedure is an erroneous one. let us explain our argument
in detail.

we start our argument by considering eq. (2) in their suggesting frame. it is true that the

(overall) time integration of (2) has a denite meaning as

dj[] = j[[, ]] + c(, )

(4)

with the central charge (23) of ref. [1] and this looks like a virasoro algebra. but the problem
of this method is that the left-hand side of (4) can not be written as

{ j[], j[]}db,

(5)

which is essential for the interpretation of the time integrated (1) as a virasoro algebra: let
us consider

{j[], h[]}db = {j[], j[]}db = j[]

which implies that h[] is the correct (asymptotic) symmetry generator, i.e.,

{(x), h[]}db = (x).

(6)

(7)

for the symmetry transformation  of the eld . [this dirac bracket as well as the poisson
bracket in eq. (19) of ref. [1] can be well-dened contrast to the claims of cadoni and mignemi
following the work of ref.
[11].] here it is an important fact that the dirac brackets are all
dened at equal times because the constituting poisson brackets are equal times in nature for
the local eld theory:

{a, b} =z dx  a

k(x, t)

b

k(x, t) 

a

k(x, t)

b

k(x, t)!

3

for the canonical conjugates pairs k(x, t), k(x, t). if we perform the (overall) time integration
over (3) the left-hand side becomes



2z 2/

0

dt{j[(t)], j[(t)]}db

or

2!2z 2/
  

0

dtz 2/

0

dt

2


(t  t){j[(t)], j[(t)]}db.

it is then clear that (6) can not be written as (5) because of the factor 2
 (tt) in the integrand.
this is a direct consequence of (6) which is a well-known fact related to the noether theorem
in the eld theory; if their claim which equating (4) and (5) was correct, the time-integrated
quantity h[] ( j[]) should be treated as the symmetry generator necessarily contrast to
(7).

in conclusion, they made a serious mistake by identifying (4) and (5) and hence their way
of applying the cardys formula to obtain the black hole entropy (25) of ref.
[1] with the
misidentied c (central charge) and l0 (lowest eigenvalue of the virasoro generator) can not be
justied.
