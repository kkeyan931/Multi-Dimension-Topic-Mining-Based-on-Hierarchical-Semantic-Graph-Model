abstract the current algebra generated by fermions coupled to external

gauge potentials and metrics on a manifold with boundary is discussed. it is shown

that the previous methods, based on index theory arguments and used in the case

without boundaries, carry over to the present problem. the resulting current alge-

bra is the same as obtained from a quantization of bosonic chern-simons theories

on space-times with nonempty boundaries. this means that also in the fermionic

setting the construction is holographic, the schwinger terms reside on the bound-

ary.

the current algebra on manifolds with boundary has drawn recently great atten-

tion because of the correspondence between gravitation theories on anti- de sitter

type (odd dimensional) space-times and conformal eld theory on the even dimen-

sional boundary, [1,2]. in hamiltonian formulation one tries to construct the theory

from the current algebra (for xed time) on the odd dimensional boundary of the

even dimensonal space. in presence of gauge symmetries a prototype for the current

algebra is an ane lie algebra on the boundary in the case of a 2 + 1 dimensional

interior space-time. this arises for example if the action functional (in the bulk)

contains yang-mills and chern-simons terms, [4]. the boundary currents play also

an important role in discussions of the quantum hall eect, [3].

the purpose of the present letter is to show how the boundary current algebra

arises from the canonical hamiltonian quantization of fermions in background gauge

elds. the method is closely related to previous studies of quantization of fermions

in background gauge elds when the physical space-time is even dimensional and

without boundary, [5,6], using a mixture of index theory and a variant of theory of

gerbes.

consider rst an even dimensional compact riemannian manifold m without

boundary. we assume that m is oriented and with a xed spin structure. let v

be a trivial vector bundle over m with an unitary action of a gauge group g. let

s be the tensor product of v and the dirac spinor bundle over m. given a gauge

potential a in v and a metric g on m we have a dirac operator dg,a acting on

the smooth sections of s. the dirac operator on a compact manifold is fredholm.

we denote by h = h(g, a) the hilbert space of square integrable sections of the

bundle s. we denote by a the space of all smooth vector potentials (with values

in the lie algebra g of the gauge group) and by m the space of riemann metrics

on m.

we recall the construction of the dirac determinant bundle (for a more detailed

discussion and references to the extensive original literature, see [7, chapter 9]). let

  r and u the set of potentials and metrics such that  is not in the spectrum

of dg,a. then u  m  a = b is an open set and over u we dene a complex

line bundle det such that the line at z  u is

(1)

det(z) = top(s+

 )  top(s

 ),

where s

 is the space of positive (negative) chirality modes in the spectral subspace

(dz)2 < .

let 0 <  < . we dene det to be a trivial complex line bundle over the

intersection u = u  u . the line at z is the tensor product

(2)

det (z) = top(s+

 )  top(s

 ),

where s

 = (s

 )  s

 . clearly det = det  det over u . further-
more, det has a canonical trivialization dened as follows. let v1, v2, . . . , vn be
any orthonormal basis of s+
 ), where
 = dz/|dz| and j is the canonical antilinear isomorphism from a hilbert space

 . then the vectors jvi form a basis of (s

to its dual. note here that dz anticommutes with the chirality operator whereas

|dz| commutes with chirality and thus  maps s+ to s. as a consequence of eq.

2 and the triviality of the bundles det , the local line bundles det patch up

to a globally dened line bundle det over b. the construction is gauge equivari-

ant, leading to a line bundle det over b/(di0(m )  g0). here g0 is the group

of based gauge transformations, i.e., those gauge transformations which at a xed

base point p  m take the value 1. di0(m ) is the group of dieomorphims h such

that h(p) = p and the derivative of h at p is the identity.

if the dirac operator dz does not have zero modes then the construction of

the fermionic fock space and the vacuum is canonical. the representation of the

car algebra is xed by the polarization h(z) = h+(z)  h(z) of the one-particle

hilbert space to positive and negative spectral subspaces. the vacuum is charac-

terized by the property

a(u)|z >= 0 = a(v)|z >

for all u  h and v  h+. the only nonzero anticommutators are [a(u), a(v)]+ =

< v, u >, the inner product in h being antilinear in the rst argument.

in the case there are zero modes there is an ambiguity. one has to decide which

of the zero modes should belong to h+ and which to h. the choice cannot be

made in an arbitrary manner if we want to have a smooth bundle of fock spaces.

we resolve this ambiguity by requiring that the vacuum is annihilated by all a(v)s

for positive chirality zero modes and all a(u)s corresponding to negative chirality

zero modes. that is, we may view the vacuum as an element in the line

det = top(s+

dz =0)  top(s

dz=0)

belonging to the space (s+

dz =0)  (s

dz =0).

to be more precise and in order to show the smoothness of this construction

one can proceed as before in the case of the bundle det. first dene local fock

bundles f over u, with  > 0, as follows. let h+, (resp. h,) be the spectral

subspace dz <  (resp. dz < ). set

(3)

f(z) = (h+,  s+

 )  (h,  s

 ).

the vacuum |z,  > in f(z) is dened as a normalized element in det(z) 

f(z). wedging this with the canonical element in det we obtain an element

in det (z)  f (z). this provides us an identication of f with f . thus we

obtain a globally dened bundle of fock spaces f over b.

3

the creation and annihilation operators are dened in a fock space f = (w )

(w ) in the standard way. the creation operator a(u) for u  w is represented

by the exterior product u and the annihilation by the contraction iu (which is

antilinear in u). the creation and annihilation operators for v  w  are a(v) = ijv

and the annihilation operator a(v) = jv  .

in the case of a manifold with boundary there are important modications to the

construction above. we have to specify elliptic boundary conditions for the dirac

operators dz.

we rst consider the aps boundary conditions, [8], dened by |m  p(h b)

over those parameters z = (g, a) such that  / spec(hz). here p is the spectral

projection to the part of the boundary hilbert space h b where hz < ; hz is the

boundary dirac operator to be dened below. in order to apply the aps theory we

have to assume that the geometry is tubular near the boundary. this means that

the metric is a product metric near m and the gauge potentials have vanishing

normal derivatives at the boundary. the dirac equation near m can be written

as


t

 = hz

where t is a coordinate in the normal direction near the boundary, hz is the (her-

mitean) boundary operator tii, i = 1, 2, . . . , 2n1 and i denotes the combined

gauge and levi-civita covariant derivative in the i:th local basis vector direction.

the operator hz commutes with the chirality operator 2n+1 and therefore the

positive and negative eigenvalues for the dirac operator in the bulk come in pairs

like in the case without boundary and the determinant line bundle and the fock

spaces are dened as before. the crucial dierence is in the fact that the determi-

nant line bundle (and therefore also the fock spaces) are only dened locally, over

the sets v = {z  b| / spec(hz)}, in the parameter space.

in order to dene the fock spaces globally one can choose a spectral section on

the boundary (for an alternative construction see [6]). we denote by det (d, p )

the determinant bundle for the family dz of dirac operators with the boundary

conditions |m  p (h b(z)). here p = p (z) is a projection operator acting in the

boundary hilbert space h b(z). it should depend smoothly on the parameter z and

the dierence p  p must be hilbert-schmidt. the determinant bundle in the

4

bulk becomes then

(4)

det (d, p ) = det (d, p)  detf (p +

 , p +)

where p is the spectral section, [10]. we have set p + = +p where  are the
chiral projectors on the boundary. since p (z) and p(z) are hilbert-schmidt re-
lated, the latter line bundle det (p +
 , p +) can be taken as the (relative) fredholm
determinant bundle over a restricted grassmannian manifold as discussed in [11].

we have also performed the standard identication of det (d) as the tensor prod-

uct top(kerd+)  top(cokerd+) which leads to the localization of the domain

to the positive chirality sector in (4).

the gauge and dieomorphism group action on the rst factor in the above

formula (4) is equivariant but not on the second factor because in general there

is no smooth equivariant choice for the spectral section p. it follows that there is

a potential obstruction to lifting the group actions to the total space of the fock

bundle due to a nontrivial extension coming from the lifting of the group actions
on potentials and metrics to the complex line bundle detf (p +

 , p +). on the level
of lie algebras this obstruction is seen as nontrivial schwinger terms in current

commutation relations. as explained in [6] the schwinger terms can be computed

from the curvature of the determinant bundles. aps index theory determines the

cohomology class of the curvature form.

any parameter z  b determines a boundary geometry zb. on the other hand,

for any zb we can choose a continuation to a metric and gauge connection z in the

bulk. the map z 7 z clearly denes a map from b/(di0  g0) to a contractible

set of parameters z (since the space of the parameters zb is contractible). let 1 

p (z) be the calderon projection associated to the dirac operator dz. by calderon

projection we mean the projection to the space of boundary values of solutions of

the dirac equation dz = 0. it is known that p (z) diers by a hilbert-schmidt

operator (in fact, by a smoothing operator) from the spectral projection p for

the boundary hamiltonian; if we drop the requirement concerning the vanishing of

the normal derivatives of metrics and potentials at the boundary, one has more

general lp type estimates replacing the hilbert-schmidt condition, [12]. it follows

that we may choose pz as the spectral section above. note that now everything
in the parametrization of the determinant lines in det (p +
 , p +) depends on the

5

boundary data only.

the curvature of det (p +

 , p +) can be computed from the aps theory. for
determining the schwinger terms one needs to know the curvature to the gauge

directions only, [6]. the result is equivalent to a standard local quantity; when the

boundary is 1-dimensional one gets the central term in an ane lie algebra and in

the 3-dimensional case it is extension part in the mickelsson-faddeev algebra.

following [9] we can construct explicitly the vacuum bundle, that is, the chiral

dirac determinant bundle from the chiral anomaly functional. restricting to the

case of a xed metric and m =  the sections of the bundle det are complex

functions  : a  c such that

(5)

(ag) = (a)  ei(g;a)

where ag = g1ag + g1dg and the anomaly functional  is an integral of a local

dierential polynomial in a and dgg1. it satises the cocycle property

(6)

(g1g2; a) = (g1; a) + (g2; ag1 ).

the important property of this construction is that it extends to the case with

boundary. the condition (5) should now hold for all potentials a which obey the

tubularity condition at the boundary and for those gauge transformations g which

smoothly approach the value 1 at the boundary. let g00 be the group of gauge

transformations with vanishing normal derivatives at the boundary and which are

equal to 1 on the boundary. we can mod out by g00 and we obtain a determinant

bundle over a/g00. we have not specied explicitly the boundary conditions p as

a function of the boundary data. the reason is that whatever choice we make for

the boundary projections p (satisfying the hilbert-schmidt relations and depending

smoothly on boundary data) the resulting bundles will be equivalent. this is seen

from (4). if we change the boundary conditions then the corresponding determinant
bundles are related by the factor det (p +, p +). modding out by the gauge and

dieomorphism symmetries in the bulk does not aect the boundary data. so even
after pushing things to a/g00 the bundle det (p +, p +) will be a bundle over the

ane space of all boundary potentials and therefore automatically trivial. clearly,

the same comments apply to metrics and dieomorphisms.

6

the bigger group m ap(m, g) of all gauge transformations (including also those

which are not equal to 1 at the boundary but still have vanishing normal derivatives)

acts projectivly in the space of sections (det ) through the formula

(t (g))(a) = ei(g;a)(ag),

where  is an integral of another local dierential polynomial, [9]. this func-

tional does not satisfy the cocycle condition. this means that t (g1)t (g2) =
t (g1g2)ei2(g1,g2;a) for some 2-cocycle 2. innitesimally this means that the lie

algebra of m ap(m, g) is extended by an abelian ideal consisting of functions

f : a  c,

(7)

[(x, f ), (y, g)] = ([x, y ], x  g  y  f + c(x, y ; a)),

where c is a lie algebra cocycle and the action x  g is the lie derivative of a

function determined by the innitesimal gauge transformation x a = [a, x] + dx.

as promised in the abstract, a basic property of the functional c(x, y ; a) is that

it depends only on the boundary values of the elds, [9]. in 2 + 1 dimensions we

have

(8)

c(x, y ; a) =

where m2 is the 2-dimensonal physical space. in 4 + 1 dimensions we have
