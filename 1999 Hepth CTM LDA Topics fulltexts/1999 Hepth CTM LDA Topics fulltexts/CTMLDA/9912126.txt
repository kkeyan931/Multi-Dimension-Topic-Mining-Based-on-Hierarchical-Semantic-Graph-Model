(11) may connected choice lorentz frame glueball angular momentum evaluated (up point implicitly assumed j gb evaluated rest frame glueball). ref. {$0101009$} investigation ( 1 2, 1 2 ) representation lorentz group, showed possible, general lorentz frame, split ( 1 2 , 1 2) space spin 1 spin 0 sectors. two special cases found spin 1 / spin 0 decomposition possible : (a) rest frame (b) helicity frame quantization axis spin projections aligned boost direction. ref.  related result found somewhat dierent context. ref.  examined break total nucleon spin terms quark spin orbital angular momentum, gluon spin orbital angular momentum. general lorentz transformation found individual terms transform properly, thus making interpretation frame dependent. ref.  also found two special frames listed (i.e. rest frame helicity frame) picked particularly useful studying spin structure nucleon. although central concerns works dier other, point importance choice lorentz frame makes study angular momentum. may imply diculty formulating clear picture spin structure glueball may rest implicit choice rest frame. certain phenomenological bag models glueballs  assumption color elds time independent true. models, lowest order, chromoelectric chromomagnetic elds analogous ordinary electric mag- netic elds inside resonant cavity chromoelectric chromomagnetic elds, gauge potentials oscillatory time-dependences. however chromoelectric chromomagnetic elds models 90o phase one another. therefore particular time chromoelectric eld maximum chromomag- netic eld zero, later time chromomagnetic eld maximum chromoelectric eld vanishes. times, either ea ba = 0, jgb = 0 eq. (1). since jgb conserved (i.e. time independent) implies jgb = 0 time. vanishing jgb one possible resolutions arrived applying angular momentum commutators jgb assuming elds time independent. thus, even phenomenological bag models time independence assumption hold, still nd restriction jgb = 0. one also present general argument support time independence elds. since jgb conserved djgb/dt = 0. eq. (1) implies z d3x"x dea dt ba + ea dba dt !# = 0 (13) (x dierentiated since time independent position vector origin particular part momentum density, ea ba). two simple ways eq. (13) satised. first, dea/dt = dba/dt = 0. implies elds time independent assumption analysis. second, ea = ba 7 eq. (13) satised. however, case, even though elds need time independent, one nds jgb = 0 eq. (1). apparently simple way jgb 6= 0 dea/dt 6= 0, dba/dt 6= 0. v. expectation jgb section calculate expectation value j gb respect glueball state, |gi, certain simplifying assumptions. eq. (7) expectation value given hg|j gb|gi = ilmz d3xhg|(cid:16)f 0n a(x)f n (x)(cid:17) |gixl (14) 0 0 = 0. terms operator aa 0 split positive negative frequency parts : aa glueball state taken normalized hg|gi = 1. since eld angular momentum operator eq. (7) gauge invariant free choose gauge without eecting physically measurable quantities like spin glueball. choose temporal gauge aa 0 implement gauge choice using gupta-bleuler-like approach making condition glueball state 0|gi = 0. aa hg|aa 0 + aa() . positive frequency part written sum annihilation operators, negative frequency part written sum creation operators. thus gauge condition hg|aa 0 = 0. next, since glueball bound state, physical (as opposed gauge) restriction 0aa = 0 also implement condition glueball state hg|0aa |gi = 0. also written terms positive negative frequency parts 0aa(+) |gi = 0 hg|0aa() = 0. expanding f 0n term gauge potentials write portion right hand side eq. (14) 0|gi = 0 becomes aa(+) |gi = 0 hg|aa() 0 = aa(+) 0 (cid:16)0ana(y) na0a(y) + gf abca0b(y)anc(y)(cid:17) f n (x)|gi (15) 0 |gi = 0 physical condition 0aa(+) using commutation rules non-abelian gauge potentials given eq. (10) move various terms coming f 0n f apply either n gauge condition aa(+) |gi = 0. order apply commutators eq. (10) changed f 0n a(x) f 0n a(y). end let x. eq. (15) f 0n a, expanded terms aas, positive negative frequency parts, negative frequency parts vanish directly hg| applied left side eq. (15). thus pull f 0n f n dealing positive frequency parts even though superscript (+) written explicitly. last term f 0n (gf abca0b(y)anc(y)) trivially commuted past f (x) since a0b(y) anc(y) commute gauge elds components spatial derivatives last commutator eq. (9). term commuted f (x) one n n f n (x)|gi f n (x)|gi = 0 (16) gauge condition aa also commuted past f derivative involved. yields n 0|gi = 0 applied. second term eq. (15), na0a(y), (x) using last commutator eq. (9) since spatial 8 f n (x)|gi = 0 (17) taken gauge condition aa commute term, 0ana(y) f 0|gi = 0 imply n(aa (x) expanding f (x) n n 0|gi) = 0. finally f n (x) = maa n(x) naa m(x) + gf adeamd(x)ae n(x) (18) m(x)] = imnn = 0 since 6= n. thus 0ana(y) eq. (9)  = innae3(y x) = 0 since 6= e). thus m(x) term f n 0ana(y)naa m(x)|gi naa m(x)(cid:16)0ana(y)|gi(cid:17) = 0 0ana(y)f adeamd(x)ae n(x)|gi f adeamd(x)ae n(x)(cid:16)0ana(y)|gi(cid:17) = 0 (19) used physical condition 0aa 0ana(y)maa maa taken respect x rather y). using gives |gi = 0. finally examine last term, n(x) = (x)(3(x y)) subscript (x) means derivative n(x)|gi. using rst commutator eq. (10) (so 0ana(y)maa n(x)0ana(y) im 0ana(y)maa n(x)|gi = hmaa = im n(x)0ana(y) im (x)(3(x y))|gi (x)(3(x y))i |gi (20) physical condition 0ana|gi = 0 used. using eq. (20) one obtains hg|j gb|gi = ilmz d3xhg|xl(im (x))|gi = ilmz d3x(cid:16)im (x)(cid:17) xl (21) hg|gi = 1 used. integrating eq. (21) parts gives iilm(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) + +z 3(x y)(m (x)xl)d3x (22) rst term zero function. integral second term evaluates kronecker delta, ml. thus expectation j gb becomes hg|j gb|gi = iilmml = iill = 0 (23) using properties s. thus imposing temporal gauge condition (aa(+) ; hg|aa() time independent (0aia(+)|gi = 0 ; hg|0aia() = 0) found hg|j |gi = 0 0 = 0) physical condition bound state gauge elds 0 gb|gi = 0. vi. conclusions examining commutation relationships () expectation value (hg|j gb|gi) glueball angular momentum operator found quantities zero. main assumption results gauge elds gb, j j 9 em , j j em ] = 0 j time-independent (0aia = 0), since glueball bound state. non-abelian nature gauge elds played little role commutation relationships j gb, since group indices traced expression j gb. thus one would expect similar result () fact found eld angular momentum, itself, satisfy angular momentum commutation relationships. light abelian examples, similarity j em results glueball angular momentum operator surprising. gb j suggested several possible resolutions/explanations results j gb. first, fact  hg|j gb|gi zero may imply pure second, results may indicate glueballs always signicant admixture quarks, contribute spin structure glueball. finally, one needs consider eect choice lorentz frame makes study interpretation angular momentum glueball system. vii. acknowledgments would like thank xiangdong ji suggested problem. also want thank gerardo munoz dharam ahluwalia discussions comments paper. 10
