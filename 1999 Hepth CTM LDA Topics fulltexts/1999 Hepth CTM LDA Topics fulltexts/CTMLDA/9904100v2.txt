conformally invariant boundary conditions for minimal models on a cylinder are classied by pairs of lie algebras (a, g)
of ade type. for each model, we consider the action of its (discrete) symmetry group on the boundary conditions. we
nd that the invariant ones correspond to the nodes in the product graph a  g that are xed by some automorphism. we
proceed to determine the charges of the elds in the various hilbert spaces, but, in a general minimal model, many consistent
solutions occur.
in the unitary models (a, a), we show that there is a unique solution with the property that the ground
state in each sector of boundary conditions is invariant under the symmetry group. in contrast, a solution with this property
does not exist in the unitary models of the series (a, d) and (a, e6). a possible interpretation of this fact is that a certain
(large) number of invariant boundary conditions have unphysical (negative) classical boundary boltzmann weights. we give a
tentative characterization of the problematic boundary conditions.

i. introduction

it has been an extremely fruitful idea to study a con-
formal eld theory by putting it on various surfaces, with
or without boundaries. apart from the sphere, that has
been considered rst, prime examples of nontrivial ge-
ometries include the torus [1] and the cylinder [2,3]. they
serve to probe dierent facets of a given conformal the-
ory. however the data specic of these surfaces are in-
extricably related to each other, and this fact provides
very stringent constraints on the theory itself, allowing
for example to determine its eld content.

for minimal conformal theories, the problem on the
torus for singlevalued elds has been resolved in [4]:
consistent models have a periodic partition function that
can be associated in a unique way with a pair (a, g) of
simple lie algebras of ade type.

the solution of the analogous problem for the cylinder
is much more recent, even if early calculations in either
specic models or with specic boundary conditions have
been carried out in [2,3,5]. the recent discovery in [6] of
a new conformally invariant boundary condition in the
3state potts model triggered a renewal of interest in
the problem. for minimal models, its solution was given
in [7,8], and shown to be encoded in the same dynkin
graphs that specify the torus partition function.

when a model has a symmetry, necessarily discrete
in this context, elds can be multiplevalued on the
torus, so that nonperiodic sectors exist.
further-
more, the elds transform under the symmetry group,
and, upon diagonalization, can be assigned charges.
all this information is encoded in frustrated partition

functions, covariant under the modular group of the
torus, a fact that can be used to, rst, detect the pres-
ence of a symmetry, and then to compute the various
partition functions [9,10].

in this article, we address the question of the action of
the symmetry group on the cylinder partition functions
for the minimal models. we show how the symmetry
group acts on the boundary conditions, and identify the
invariant (or symmetric) ones. we then study the charge
assignments of the elds that occur in the presence of
those boundary conditions.

section ii is a reminder about the minimal conformal
models on a torus and on a cylinder. in section iii, we
discuss the action of the symmetry group on the confor-
mally invariant boundary conditions, which is then used
in section iv to compute frustrated partition functions
on a cylinder, or equivalently the charge assignment of
the boundary elds. section v contains explicit formu-
lae and computational details of a particular assignment.
its unicity (in fact nonunicity) is examined in section
vi, from which we conclude that, in general, a large num-
ber of distinct charge assignments are consistent. we also
derive selection rules for the boundary fusion coecients.
we nish, in section vii, with an analysis of the unitary
models for which we propose an unambiguous charge as-
signment.

section vii contains the most interesting corollary of
the previous sections. an analysis based on the expected
consequences of the perronfrobenius theorem xes a
unique charge assignment in the unitary (a, a) models,
which we conjecture to be the correct one. this is in
sharp contrast with the models of the (a, d) and (a, e6)
series. for those, there is no consistent charge assign-
ment that is compatible with the perronfrobenius the-
orem, the reason being that there is no way to ensure
an invariant ground state in all sectors. motivated by
the results obtained for the potts model [6], we will in-
terpret this phenomenon as the nonexistence of positive
classical boltzmann weights for some invariant boundary

conditions. a simple characterization of them suggests
itself in terms of their dynkin graph labels.

ii. minimal models

minimal models are classied by a pair (a, g) of
simplylaced simple lie algebras with coprime coxeter
numbers, p and q. one may assume that p is odd. their
periodic partition function on a torus of modulus  is a
sesquilinear form in the virasoro characters

z(a, g) =xi,j

mij 

i ( ) j ( ),

mij  n,

(2.1)

where i, j are labels for virasoro highest weight repre-
sentations. they lie in the kac table {(r, s) : 1  r 
p  1, 1  s  q  1}, in which (r, s) and (p  r, q  s)
must be identied. the connection with the lie algebras
is best brought out by writing the diagonal elements mii
as [4]

z(a, g) = 1

2 xrexp a

sexp g

|r,s|2 + o-diagonal,

(2.2)

where r and s run over the exponents of a and g. the
full expressions of the partition functions are given in [4].
the question of the symmetry group has been rst ad-
dressed in [?], and solved in rv for the unitary models
|p  q| = 1. the analysis can however be easily extended
to the nonunitary minimal models, with the following
result. with the exception of the models (ap1, aq1)
with p and q odd, which have no symmetry at all, the
other models (a, g) have a nite symmetry group ,
which is the group of automorphisms of the dynkin
graph of g, that is, (g) = z2 except (d4) = s3 and
(e7, e8) = {e}.

when a model has a symmetry group, the elds may
have a nontrivial monodromy along the two periods
of the torus, transforming as (z + 1) = g(z) and
(z +  ) = g
(z) for two commuting1 elements g, g  .
in the hamiltonian formalism, this amounts to give a
hilbert space hg of states with a gmonodromy along the
rst period, which are then acted on by g when trans-
ported along the second period. the latter action can be
diagonalized, g
|i = e2iq/n |i, dening the charge q
of the eld  under the action of g, an element of order
n .

the eld content of hg as well as their charges
can be read o from the frustrated partition functions
zg,g (a, g). these are still sesquilinear forms but with
coecients in z(e2i/||):

zg,g = trhg hql0c/24 q

l0c/24 gi.

(2.3)

because a modular transformation mixes the two periods,
it must be accompanied by a corresponding change of
monodromies so that the net eect vanish (for a xed
pair (a, g)):

zg,g ( ) = zgagc,gbgd( a +b

c +d ).

(2.4)

all such functions are given explicitly in [10] (with a
straightforward extension to the nonunitary case). the
function (2.2) corresponds to g = g = e.

on a cylinder, say of length l and perimeter t , only
one virasoro algebra remains, so that the partition func-
tion is linear rather than sesquilinear in the characters [2].
conformally invariant boundary conditions ,  must be
prescribed on the two boundaries, and a monodromy con-
dition g must be imposed along the periodic coordinate,
(z + t ) = g(z). we rst consider a trivial monodromy,
g = e.

if the time variable is dened to run along the peri-
odic direction, the partition function is the trace of the
transfer matrix et h, ,

(2.5)

, gives the multiplicity of the primary

alternatively, one may view the time evolution as going
from one boundary to the other. in this case, the states
on constant time surfaces belong to the bulk periodic
hilbert space he, and are propagated in time from one
boundary state |i to the other |i (formally also in he).
the partition function is then

z e

,( ) = h|elhe|i,

(2.6)

with he the hamiltonian corresponding to periodic bulk
sector.

the boundary states are conformally invariant, sat-
isfying (ln  ln)|i for all n  z [3]. the solu-
tions to this equation are the ishibashi states [11]: ev-
ery highest weight representation [i  i] contains exactly
one such state, which we denote by |iii, while the other
representations [i  j], for i 6= j, do not contain any.
in the present situation, the ishibashi states must be
taken from the space he, and hence are labelled by
ee = {i : [i  i]  he}.

expanding the boundary states in the basis of ishibashi
 |iii, makes the partition function

states, |i = pi ci

(2.6) take the form

z,( ) = xiee

 i( 1

(2.7)

1that forces us to focus on abelian subgroups of . thus
in this paper we consider z2 and z3 (sub)groups only.

the arguments of the characters in (2.5) and (2.7) are

which the characters transform linearly through a uni-
tary matrix s. comparing the two formulae then yields

(2.8)

the relations (2.8) are overdetermined for the vectors
cj, and provide a means to classify the boundary condi-
tions |i, to compute the spectra of h,, and in turn
the surface scaling dimensions. such calculations have
been carried out in [2,5,6], but the general answer ap-
peared only very recently in [7,8]. let 1 be the label
corresponding to the vacuum representation, namely to
(r, s) = (1, 1) = (p  1, q  1).

in [8],

it was observed that, upon setting ci

tion

where um(2 cos x) = sin (m + 1)x/ sin x is the mth
tchebychev polynomial of the second kind. the auto-
morphism (a, b) 7 (a, b) can be determined from the
condition n(r,s) = n(pr,qs) (necessary if the ni are to
it yields a and b to be
satisfy the fusion algebra).

g 6= deven, e7, e8, and b = b for g = deven, e7, e8.

viewing the tensor products f i(a, g) = nr  vs as
the fused adjacency matrices of a  g, the above result
may be summarized by saying that ni is a folded fused
adjacency matrix of a  g

the matrices ni have eigenvalues si,j/s1,j, and a com-
mon eigenbasis is given by the vectors j. as a result,
they satisfy the fusion rules

the eigendata for the matrices a and g make sure that
the matrices in (2.11) satisfy the minimal model fusion
algebra. for the (a, a) models, the ai (resp. bi) labels
run over the same set as r (resp. s), and the matrices ni
are the fusion matrices n i themselves [3].

reversing the argument, the authors of [8] conclude that
an nvalued representation of the fusion algebra of di-
mension |ee| provides a solution to cardys equation with
|ee| dierent boundary conditions. when ci
is an invertible matrix, this solution yields the maximal
set of conformally invariant boundary conditions. note
that the boundary states |i are determined up to a
phase, but the fact that the entries of ni are to be positive
integers leaves only a global, unobservable, phase.

/ps1,i

 = i

for minimal models, this was all made explicit in [7].
for the model (a, g), it was shown that each node in
the product dynkin diagram a  g, quotiented by an
appropriate z2 automorphism, denes a boundary con-
dition and viceversa.
from (2.2), the num-
ber of ishibashi states in the periodic sector is |ee| =
1
2 |expa  expg|, so that only half the nodes can dene
distinct boundary conditions. we will use the variables
,  and (ai, bi) as labels for the nodes of a  g. the
letters a and g will denote at the same time the lie
algebras, the dynkin diagrams or the corresponding ad-
jacency matrices.

indeed,

as a result of the quotient of the product graph, the

matrices ni, for i = (r, s), are given by [7]

we now proceed to the analysis of the cylinder par-
tition functions when there is a group of symmetry .
from now on, we thus take q even, and g 6= e7, e8.

the boundary states are combinations of periodic
ishibashi states, on which the action of  is known from
the torus partition functions ze,g. this induces an action
on the boundary states which one can determine. that
action must be by permutations.

for the minimal models, a boundary state corresponds

to a pair of nodes of a and g,

i(a, b) |iii.

(3.1)

|(a, b)i = xiee

ps1,i

where the i form an eigenbasis for the concrete matrices
in (2.11).

let us denote by  the automorphisms of the dynkin
graph of g, so that every  has xed points. (the auto-
morphism of the a factor has a free action, and is used
to obtain a set of representatives under the  involution,
see (2.11).) each  has a diagonalizable action on the
eigenvectors i.

the action of g   on a periodic ishibashi state can
be read o from the diagonal terms in the frustrated par-
tition function ze,g(a, g) [10]. these can be compactly

in this formula, the n s and the v s are the fused adja-
cency matrices of a and g respectively. they are dened

2the automorphism  in g thus coincides with the charge
conjugation in the corresponding ane algebra g.

presented as follows. if g has order n , and if one writes
the diagonal terms in ze,g as

ze,g = xiee

qg (i)
n

|i|2 + . . . ,

(3.2)

then, for a proper choice of the i, the phase is seen to
be exactly equal to the eigenvalue of i under an order
n automorphism :

i(a, (b)) = qg (i)

n

i(a, b).

(3.3)

the  that is induced by g through the previous formula
is unambiguous in the models (a, g) if g is not d4: the
only nontrivial g induces the only nontrivial . when
the d4 algebra is involved, exactly which  in s3 arises
from a set of charges qg (univoquely given by ze,g) de-
pends on the eigenbasis we choose. in particular, a same
set of z2 charges can lead to the three dierent (but con-
jugate) order two s.

it quickly follows from (3.1) and (3.3) that an order n
group element g acts on the boundary states as an order
n automorphism :

|(a, b)i  |g(a, b)i = |(a, (b))i.

(3.4)

therefore, for any subgroup  of , the symmetric
boundary conditions correspond to the nodes of a  g
that are xed by a group  of automorphisms of g. this
set of nodes form a graph which we call the xed point
graph and denote by a  g.

in particular, the boundary conditions that are invari-
ant under a group element g correspond to the nodes in
a  g, with g the part of g that is xed by the auto-
morphism  induced by g. as before the pairs of nodes
which are related by the  automorphism dene the same
invariant boundary conditions. in the minimal models,
the xed point diagrams that arise for the various choices
of g are

(ap1, aq1) :

(ap1, dq/2+1) :
(ap1, d4) :
(ap1, e6) :

t(p1)/2  a1,
t(p1)/2  aq/21,
t(p1)/2  a1,
t(p1)/2  a2,

(g2 = e),

(g3 = e),

(3.5)

where t(p1)/2 denotes the tadpole diagram obtained by
quotienting ap1 by its automorphism .

for instance, the xed point graph of an element g
of order two in the (ap1, dq/2+1) model is graphically
given by

iv. cylinder partition functions

 and  are two boundary conditions that are invariant
under a group element g, of order n .

it implies that the transfer matrix eh, and g com-
mute, and can be diagonalized in the same basis. the
eect, on the cylinder partition function, of the insertion
of g on a line connecting the two boundaries is to aect
each virasoro tower with a n th root of unity, so that
the rst form (2.5) becomes

z g

,( ) =xi

n(g) i
, i( ).

(4.1)

this shows that n(g) i must be related in the following
way to the restriction of ni to the gsymmetric boundary
conditions: an entry of ni equal to n becomes in n(g) i a
sum of n n th roots of unity.

in the second form, the boundary state |i is propa-
gated to |i by the hamiltonian that acts on the bulk
sector twisted by g, so that

z g
,( ) = h|elhg |i.

(4.2)

this formula makes it clear that the states |i and |i
should have a projection in the twisted hilbert space hg,
and being conformally invariant, must have expansions in
ishibashi states of the bulk gsector, themselves labelled
by eg = {i :

one obtains a cardy equation

(4.3)



for all boundary conditions which are gsymmetric.

by inspecting the torus partition functions zg,e(a, g)
[10] (see also the next section), one readily sees that the
matrices c(g) i

are square, namely



|eg| = 1

2 |a  g| = |t  g|,
where the factor 1
2 accounts for the identication under .
let us also note that, since the gishibashi states form a
basis for boundary states that are invariant under g, they
should themselves be all neutral for consistency. this is
again easily checked from zg,g.

(4.4)

the rest of this article is devoted to a discussion of the
solutions to the cardy equation (4.3). we will suggest
that the proper physical solution is a natural generaliza-
tion to g 6= e of the two formulae (2.9) and (2.13) for
ni.

our rst statement is that a particular solution, com-
patible with ni  n(e) i, is provided, modulo a sign i, by
the folded fused adjacency matrices of the graph a  g:

n(g) i

, = i(cid:2)f i

,(a, g) + f i

, (a, g)(cid:3),

i = 1.

(4.5)

the consequences of a symmetry can now be pursued
at the level of the partition functions. let us suppose that

here  = (a1, b1) and  = (a2, b2) are pairs of nodes in
a  g (with the usual identication under ), and the
automorphism  is the same as before.

4

when g,  6= e, this formula can be simplied because
every b2 in g is a xed point of .
indeed since  is
a node of a  g, b2 is a xed point of . but  and
 coincide, except for g = deven for which  is trivial.
thus the folding by  acts on a2 only, resulting in an
eective folding of the a factor onto a t graph (hence
the graphs (3.5)). one also checks that the folded fused
adjacency matrices of ap1 are the fused adjacency ma-
trices of t(p1)/2. thus the matrices in (4.5) are simply
proportional to the fused adjacency matrices of the xed
point diagram

where the last line refers to the models (ap1, e6) for
which q = 12. thus, except when g = a1 and when
q = 2 mod 4, the last condition in (4.8) is not fullled.

q

owing to the parity properties of the tchebychev poly-
nomials, um(x) = (1)mum(x), one easily sees that
2 +1 t(p1)/2 in the rst and third cases of
x = (1)
(4.11), and x = t(p1)/2 in the second and fourth ones,
together with y = g, do satisfy all three conditions and
therefore generate the correct algebra.

correspondingly, one nds that the matrices n(g) i =

f i(x, y ) = if i(t, g) with the following signs,

n(g) i
, = i f i

,(t, g) = i ur1(t )a1,a2 us1(g)b1,b2 .

(4.6)

the matrices f i(t, g) fall short of satisfying the min-
imal fusion algebra, but the factors i can be adjusted so
that the n(g) i do satisfy it.

the fusion algebra of the minimal model m(p, q) is
polynomially generated by two generators x and y ,
which one can associate with the representatives of n (2,1)
and n (1,2) [12]. the other elements of the algebra are ex-
plicitly given by tchebychev polynomials

n i = ur1(x) us1(y ),

(4.7)

and the generators must satisfy three relations:

up1(x) = uq1(y ) = up2(x)  uq2(y ) = 0. (4.8)

the matrices f i(t, g) have the proper form (4.7),
and t(p1)/2 and g do indeed satisfy the rst two rela-
tions in (4.8). this is most easily seen by verifying that
all eigenvalues satisfy the relevant equation. for instance,
the eigenvalues m of t(p1)/2 are in

spec(t p1
2

) = {2 cos m
p

: 1  m odd  p  1},

(4.9)

and clearly satisfy up1(m) = 0.

in the same way, one computes that

(ap1, aq1) :
2 +1) :
(ap1, d q
(ap1, d4) :
(ap1, e6) :

i = (1)(r+1)( q
i = (1)r+1,

2 +1),

(g2 = e),

(g3 = e),

i = 1,
i = (1)r+1.

(4.12)

obey the minimal fusion algebra. because of the signs i
but also because the matrices f i(t, g) are not positive
for  6= e (they are however of constant sign), the n(g) i
provide zrepresentations4 of the minimal fusion algebra.
it remains to prove our earlier assertion that the so

dened n(g) i are solutions to cardys equation (4.3).

since they satisfy the fusion algebra, the n(g) i must
have eigenvalues given by ratios si,j
of s matrix ele-
s1,j
ments. it is not dicult to see, by looking rst at the
partition functions zg,e to get eg and then by comput-
ing the ratios explicitly, that the eigenvalues of n(g) i are
precisely the above ratios for j  eg (see next section).
thus the following diagonalization formulae hold

n(g) i

, = xjeg

(g) j



si,j
s1,j

(g) j


,

(4.13)

where the vectors (g) j form a common orthonormal
eigenbasis (also common to all fused adjacency matri-
ces f i(t, g) of the xed point diagram). this yields
the value of the coecients in (4.3)

up2(t p1

2

) = 1.

(4.10)

c(g) j
 =

(g) j



.

(4.14)

the corresponding calculation for g yields3, in the same
four cases as in (3.5),

g = a q

g = a1 :
2 1 :
g = a1 :
g = a2 :

uq2(g) = (1)
uq2(g) = 1,
uq2(g) = 1,
u10(g) = 1,

q

2 +1 1,

(4.11)

to complete the proof, it is enough to show that they
are compatible with the ni, in the sense that has been
explained in section iii: an entry in ni equal to n goes
over, in n(g) i, to a sum of n roots of unity, and moreover
n(g) 1 = 1. one may verify that this is indeed the case.
we omit the proof here since, to a large extent, it is given
in the next section.

3the adjacency matrix of a1 is the number zero, so that
its fused adjacency matrices are us1(0) = (1)(s1)/2 for s
odd, and 0 for s even.

4in case of a z3 symmetry group, one might expect
z(e2i/3)valued representations. this is however excluded
by the symmetry zg
, (time reversal invariance),
which implies the reality of n(g) i
, .

the formulae (4.5) and (4.13) bear much resemblance
with the corresponding ones for ni, of which they consti-
tute a natural extension. like the ni, the matrices n(g) i
have a graph theoretic description derived from that of ni
through the action of g, they satisfy the minimal fusion
algebra, and their eigenvalues are exactly labelled by the
set eg which species the diagonal terms of the twisted
partition functions zg,e. in a sense, this set eg can also
be viewed as the set of exponents of the xed point graph
that serves to dene n(g) i.

shows that the eigenvalues of n(g) i are indeed the num-
bers in (5.4) for j  eg.

as mentioned before, the matrices ni are the fusion

matrices n i themselves [3], equal, from (2.11), to

ni

(a1, q

(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

for all odd s, and identically equal to zero for s even.
this then leads to

v. more explicit formulae

this equation shows clearly that n(g) i is compatible with
ni in the sense explained before.

we give here the computational details and the proofs

that were missing in the previous section.

 = (a, b) are controlled by the tadpole graph t(p1)/2

all models (ap1, dq/2+1), with two coprime integers
p, q and p odd as before, have also a z2 symmetry. the
nontrivial group element g induces the automorphism 
of dq/2+1 which exchanges the last two nodes. therefore
the symmetric boundary states correspond to the nodes
(a, b) of the xed point diagram t(p1)/2  aq/21, pic-
tured in section iii, so that a is between 1 and (p  1)/2,
and b is between 1 and q/2  1.

the eigenvalues of t(p1)/2 have been recalled earlier,

while those of aq/21 are well known:

simply notice the following modular identity (same values

it has the immediate consequence that

n(g) i

(5.15)

(5.16)

which shows the required compatibility.

one may note that all the entries of n(g) i are in
{0, +1, 1}, and that those of ni are in {0, 1, 2}, which
implies that all doubled primary elds have opposite z2
charges within each pair.

when q = 6, i.e. for the (ap1, d4) models, z3 invari-
ant boundary conditions can be investigated. they are
labelled by nodes (a, 2) with a in t(p1)/2.

the z3 frustrated partition functions on the torus are

so that the ishibashi states in the z3twisted sector have
labels j = (m, 3) for m odd between 1 and p  1.

the matrices n(g) i in (4.6) can be compared with the
restriction of ni to the sector of invariant boundary condi-
tions, given by ur1(t(p1)/2)a1,a2 us1(d4)2,2. all ma-
trices are identically zero for s even, while for s odd:

ni = ur1(t p1

for s = 1, 5,

ni = 2ur1(t p1

n(g) i = ur1(t p1

for s = 3.

(5.18)

as in the z2 case, the second line shows that the doubled
elds have opposite and nonzero z3 charge (if  6= 1 is
a third root of unity,  + 2 = 1).

c. the series (a,e6)

same as for the (a, d) models (with aq/21 replaced by
a2).

a unique feature of the models based on e6 however
is that some of the elds occur tripled in some boundary
conditions (in addition to some others being doubled).
one nds that these are the elds (r, s) with s = 5 and 7,
in the boundary conditions corresponding to the nodes
(a, 3), for a in t(p1)/2 (with b = 3 the intersection of
the three branches of e6). this follows from the fused
adjacency matrices u4(e6) and u6(e6), which, when re-
stricted to the nodes b = 3, 6 corresponding to the sym-
metric boundary conditions, read

u4(e6) = u6(e6) =(cid:18) 3

vi. unicity

the boundary conditions that are invariant under a
group element g correspond to boundary states which
have expansions in gishibashi states 5

|i = xieg

c(g) i


|iiig.

(6.1)

the coecients in (4.14) provide a specic solution n(g) i
to cardys equation (4.3). as for the ni, one may raise
the question of the unicity of this solution.

for every g, the symmetric boundary conditions ex-
haust the gishibashi states. it means that every other
symmetric boundary state must be a linear combination
of those we already have, and so must be one of them.
however, since the boundary states |i enter cardys for-
mula through scalar products, it is the boundary rays
more than the boundary states which matter. thus the
basic question is whether one keeps a sensible solution if
one multiplies the boundary states by phases.

clearly if the symmetric boundary states are multi-
plied by phases, |i  |i, the matrices change ac-
cording to n(g) i
, , which satisfy the minimal
fusion algebra for any choice of phases.

,  

 n(g) i

whereas for g = e, the positivity of n(e) i = ni forces
all the phases to be equal, this is no longer the case when
g 6= e. since the matrices n(g) i are zvalued, the only
condition one has is that the phases must be equal up to
signs,  =  .

for a z2 symmetry (or subgroup), the new matrices
 n(g) i
, are also solutions of the cardy equation, be-
cause they too are compatible with the ni. indeed the
compatibility amounts to check that ni and n(g) i coin-
cide modulo 2, which obviously remains true if signs are

the models (ap1, e6) are similar to the (a, d) mod-
els. in particular the formula for the matrices n(g) i is the

inserted. moreover, the identity occurs in the diagonal
boundary conditions only,  = , for which the signs
cancel out.

on the contrary, in the case of a z3 symmetry, the
insertion of signs  does not yield sensible solutions (as
far as the minimal models are concerned). the reason is
that some of the elds occur with multiplicity two. since
the corresponding entries in n(g) i must be real combina-
tions of two third roots of unity, they can only be 2 or
1. therefore, changing their sign by inserting some 
is not consistent.

thus when the symmetry group is z2, there is a vast
number of seemingly acceptable solutions. these various
solutions dier by the charges which are assigned to the
primary elds in mixed boundary conditions ( 6= ).
the freedom we have in choosing the  reects the fact
that the charge normalization in mixed boundary condi-
tions cannot be xed a priori, unlike what happens for
diagonal boundary conditions, in which an identity oc-
curs.

one may try to derive more constraints on the charge
normalizations by requiring that the boundary charge as-
signments be compatible with (i) the charge assignments
in the bulk, and (ii) the boundary eld operator product
coecients.

the rst requirement is a condition on the way bulk
elds close to a boundary (taken to be y = 0) expand in
boundary elds [13,14]

j (x + iy)  xb.c. xk

()bk

j (2y)hk2hj 

k (x),

(6.2)

where the summation on  is over all boundary condi-
tions, not just the invariant ones. the z2 symmetry im-
plies selection rules on the coecients since a bulk eld of
a given parity should expand in a combination of bound-
ary elds that transforms the same way. it means that
the parity of the eld 
k must match that of j for all
invariant boundary conditions  such that ()bk

j 6= 0.

since these expansions involve elds in diagonal
boundary conditions only, the selection rules that fol-
low are the same no matter what the signs  are. this
does not prove however that the selection rules are indeed
satised. for the diagonal models (a, a), the coecients
()bk
j are known explicitly [15], and it would be interest-
ing to check directly that their values are consistent with
the boundary charge assignment found here.

the second check concerns the operator algebra of the

boundary elds themselves [13,14]

i (x) 


j (x) xk

c() k

ij

(x  x)hkhihj 

k (x).

(6.3)

restricting to invariant boundary conditions , , , the
discrete symmetry implies again selection rules which re-
quire that the charges given by the matrices n(g) i provide

8

a grading of the boundary fusion algebra6:

c() k

ij

6= 0 = n(g) i

, n(g) j

, = n(g) k
, .

(6.4)

it is obvious that if the matrix coecients n(g) i
, satisfy
(6.4), the same will be true of  n(g) i
, , so that here
too, these matrices are all consistent with the boundary
operator product expansion (6.3), or else none of them
is. as the discrete symmetry is expected to occur, one
can be condent in the fact that the selection rules will
be satised. we give below examples of selection rules in
the most explicit case, namely the diagonal models. we
have not shown in general that they are indeed satised,
and as before, a proof not based on symmetry arguments
would be valuable.

in the diagonal models (a, a), the boundary conditions
are in onetoone correspondence with the chiral primary
elds through their labelling by two nodes (a, b) taken
in ap1 and aq1. as before, the boundary conditions
(a, b) = (p  a, q  b) and (a, b) are to be identied.
without loss of generality, one may thus assume that the
rst label (the rlabel) is odd.

the boundary operator product coecients are known
explicitly from [15], where they were proved to be equal
to coecients of the crossing matrices (in a suitable nor-
malization)

j(cid:21) .

(6.5)

i

since for instance, an odd boundary eld 

cannot
occur in its fusion with itself, the corresponding crossing
coecient must vanish. the verication that it does is
nontrivial only when the chiral eld i indeed occurs in
its own bulk fusion (namely n i
ii 6= 0), when the primary
eld i indeed occurs in the diagonal boundary conditions
(ni
, 6= 0 for  invariant under z2), and when it is an
odd eld (n(g) i
, = 1). all three conditions can be easily
worked out, and yield

f,i(cid:20)  

i (cid:21) = 0

i

(6.6)

for all i = (r, s) such that r, s are odd, s = 3 mod 4,
r  (2p  1)/3, s  (2q  1)/3, and for all  = (a, q/2)
such that (r + 1)/2  a  p/2.

the simplest example where such constraints arise is
the tetracritical ising model (a4, a5), in which (6.6) im-
plies (in terms of conformal weights)

6we leave aside the cases where some matrix elements n(g) i
,
are zero without having the corresponding elements in ni
equal to zero. this happens when primary elds come in
pairs of opposite charge.

(6.7)

more conditions can be derived in a generic diagonal
model.

to summarize, the matrices n(g) i displayed in (4.6) and
(4.12) yield but a particular solution to cardys equation.
for a z3 symmetry, they form the only consistent solu-
tion,

, = n(g) i
n(g) i
, ,

(g3 = e),

(6.8)

whereas, in the case of a z2 symmetry, there are many
more given by

, =  n(g) i
n(g) i
, ,

 = 1

(g2 = e),

(6.9)

for arbitrary signs. the eect of these signs is to reverse
(or to maintain, depending to the value of ) the par-
ity of all the elds that occur in the sector of boundary
conditions , .

the ambiguity in the normalization of the z2 charges
that arises due to these signs must be resolved on physi-
cal grounds. as the interpretation of the boundary elds
is lacking in the general nonunitary model, it is not
clear to the author what the correct requirement should
be. in this context, the specic choice  = +1 for all
 is a minimal and natural one, as it extends nicely the
corresponding formula for g = e, and retains much of
the graph theoretic description. it also has the distinc-
tive feature of producing matrices n(g) i of constant sign,
either totally positive or totally negative7. however in
view of what follows, this may not be the correct choice.
in a unitary model, the ground state of every sector is
expected to be invariant under the symmetry group, on
account of the perronfrobenius theorem applied to the
transfer matrix. this provides a welldened criterion
to x the normalization of the charges, and therefore the
physical value of the signs . we will use this criterion
as a guide, in order to see if a particular set of values 
emerges from this point of view.

7there is another solution in terms of matrices of constant
sign, which is obtained by substituting g for g in the
formula (4.6) giving n(g) i. the substitution has no eect
when g = a1, since the associated adjacency matrix is the
number zero, while in the other cases, it causes the matrices
n(g) i to be multiplied by (1)s+1. this sign can be seen to
be in the line of the previous discussion, because it is equal
to (1)s+1 =  with  = (1)b+1 if  = (a, b). the
existence of this solution is a consequence of a nontrivial
automorphism of the graph g.

vii. unitary models

in this last section, we explore the possibility of xing
the value of the signs  by using the criterion we have
just mentioned: if the continuum limit is smooth enough,
it is expected that the consequences of the perron
frobenius theorem on the nitedimensional transfer ma-
trix be maintained in the corresponding conformal eld
theory. in particular, for all invariant boundary condi-
tions, the ground state of the hamiltonian h, (the pri-
mary eld of lowest conformal dimension in h,) should
be nondegenerate and (hence) invariant under the sym-
metry group.
in short, we will call this the perron
frobenius (pf) criterion. as already said, it is auto-
matically satised in the diagonal boundary conditions.
thus we look for a set of  such that the z2 charge
assignment meet the pf criterion. incidentally, when the
symmetry group is z3, there is only one consistent charge
assignment (see the previous section). in that case, we
will merely check whether the pf criterion is satised.

the outcome of this investigation is somewhat surpris-
ing. the unitary diagonal models are the only ones where
the pf criterion can be met, for a unique choice of the
s. in all other unitary models, there is no way in which
it can be fullled, if one insists that it be valid in all sec-
tors. a physical interpretation of this will be proposed8.
nonetheless, for all those models but two, we will see
that a unique set of s is singled out by demanding a
minimal violation of the pf criterion.

we recall that the conformal weight of a primary eld

labelled by i = (r, s) is equal to

hr,s =

(qr  ps)2  (p  q)2

4pq

.

(7.1)

throughout this section, we will take p odd and q = p1
even. then the smallest conformal weights correspond,
in ascending order, to i = (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), . . ..

a. the unitary series (a,a)

the only boundary primary elds that occur in the
diagonal models have their slabel odd (see (5.7)). since
the identity (1,1) does not appear in mixed boundary
conditions, the primary with the lowest weight that can
possibly occur in mixed boundary conditions corresponds
to (3,3), and consequently, the odiagonal entries of

n(g) (3,3)
,

= n(g) (3,3)

(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ) = a1 a2 u2(t p1

2

)a1,a2 (7.2)

must be positive. the odiagonal matrix coecients
u2(t )a1,a2 equal 1 if |a1  a2| = 2 or if {a1, a2} = {(p

about this issue.

9

3)/2, (p  1)/2}, and 0 otherwise (it counts the number
of paths of length 2 going from a1 to a2 on the graph
t(p1)/2). thus one obtains the condition a1a2 = 1
for all these pairs. this xes the vector a in a unique
way (up to a global sign that does not matter) as

a = (. . . , +1, +1, 1, 1, +1, +1, 1, 1, +1).

(7.3)

for these specic signs, one may then verify that in the
remaining mixed boundary sectors (those for which (3,3)
does not occur), the eld of lowest weight has indeed a
parity +1 (zero charge). to do that, one can rst observe
that any mixed boundary sector has its eld of lowest
weight in {(r, s) : 3  r = s odd  p  2}. next point is
to note that ur1(t )a1,a2 is zero unless the nodes a1, a2
can be related by a path of length r  1. if the two nodes
cannot be connected by a shorter path, it follows from
(7.3) that a1a2 = (1)(r1)/2, so that the numbers

n(g) (r,r)
(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ) = a1a2 (1)(r1)/2ur1(t )a1,a2

(7.4)

are positive (or zero). that a1 and a2 can be connected
by a shorter path means that the eld (r, r) is not the
primary with the lowest weight in that sector, and we are
back to the rst case.

since the pf criterion can be satised in all sectors for
a unique set of s, it is tempting to conjecture that these
are the correct physical values. the charge content in the
various sectors of the unitary diagonal models would then
be given by

n(g) i
(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ) = a1 a2 n(g) i
(a1, q

2 ),(a2, q

2 ),

(7.5)

with the signs (7.3), and the n(g) i as in (5.7).

b. the unitary series (a,d)

the same calculations can be carried out for the uni-
tary models of the (a, d) series, with however dierent
results. to illustrate it most clearly, we will start with
the simplest case, namely (a4, d4), corresponding to the
critical 3potts model (p = 5, q = 6).

a set of z2symmetric boundary conditions is pro-
vided9 by the socalled a, bc, free and new [6]. they
correspond respectively to the nodes (1,1), (2,1), (1,2)
and (2,2).
(free and new, being fully invariant under
s3, must correspond to b = 2, which is the only node of

9the model has eight conformally invariant boundary con-
ditions which are invariant under a z2, but not under the
same z2. one nds three groups of four boundary conditions
that are simultaneously invariant under the same z2. they
clearly correspond to the three conjugate z2 subgroups of s3,
the automorphism group of d4.

10

d4 invariant under s3.) together they dene 10 dierent
sectors.

it is not dicult to nd the eld with lowest weight in
each of these sectors, and then compute the parity they
are assigned by the matrices n(g) i computed in section
v. writing these in a matrix m , one obtains (indices are
a, bc, free, new)

m, =(cid:16)n(g) imin

the zeros are due to the partition function (superscripts
are the conformal weights)

zfree,new = 2 1/15

3,3 + 2/5

3,5 + 7/5
3,1 ,

(7.7)

which shows that the ground state in that sector is doubly
degenerate, the two states having opposite parities.

the above matrix makes clear that the charge assign-
ment implied by n(g) i does not satisfy the pf criterion
in all sectors, either because the ground state is not in-
variant, or because it is degenerate. one may try to
nd values for  that render the nondegenerate ground
states invariant, but one easily sees that it is not possi-
ble: no values for  can be found so that m,  0 for
all , .

one can relax our demands by looking for a set of 
which minimizes the number of sectors that violate the
pf criterion. one then nds that the minimal number
of such sectors, which we call nonpf, is equal to

nnonpf = 2.

(7.8)

this number is realized for  = (+1, 1, +1, 1) =
(+1, 1)a  (1, 1)b,
the two nonpf sectors being
bc,new and free,new. indeed for these , one obtains

 m, =


+1 +1 +1 +1

+1 +1 +1 1

+1 +1 +1

0

+1 1

0 +1


.

(7.9)

let us also notice that if one excludes just one boundary
condition, namely new, the expected consequences of
the pf theorem are indeed veried. thus in this case,
the minimal number of boundary conditions that have to
be excluded for this to be true is equal to 1.

finally one may note that  = (+1, 1, +1, +1) share
the same properties, the two nonpf sectors being now
a,new and free,new.

in any case, one must conclude that the transfer ma-
trix, in certain sectors of boundary conditions, does not
satisfy the conditions of the pf theorem. there can be
only two reasons for that: either the transfer matrix is

not irreducible10, or else it contains negative entries, im-
plying that some of the boundary boltzmann weights are
negative (or both).

that the rst condition fails is unlikely because the
periodic transfer matrix is irreducible and because the
boundary conditions are undecomposable. so one should
favour the second alternative, which points to the un-
physical nature of some of the boundary conditions,
their classical description requiring negative boltzmann
weights. we note that a boundary condition  which is
described by negative boltzmann weights does not nec-
essarily lead to unphysical (negative, nonpf) partition
functions. whether or not this is the case depends on
which other boundary condition is associated with .

the appearance of negative classical boundary boltz-
mann weights to describe the new boundary condition
in the critical 3potts model has been discussed in [6],
and is conrmed by the explicit calculation of the critical
boundary weights [17].

as we shall see, what is true in the 3potts model is
true in all unitary models of the (a, d) series. no values
for the s exist which make all sectors to satisfy the
pf criterion, but a suitable choice, unique, contrary to
the above case, of  minimizes the number of sectors
which do not satisfy it. as above we will take the point
of view that these features are the signal that a certain
number of boundary conditions are unphysical, because
they require negative boltzmann weights for their classi-
cal description.

we have not carried out the analysis of the whole se-
ries, but instead we have investigated the rst eight mod-
els, up to p = 13 and q = 12, with the following results.
in each of these models, we have determined the min-
imal number nunphys of boundary conditions that must
be disregarded in order to satisfy the pf criterion in all
the sectors involving the remaining ones. this uniquely
singles out a set of boundary conditions, which natu-
rally qualies as the set of unphysical boundary condi-
tions. this also determines unique values of the  for
the physical ones. the values of  for the unphysical
 are then xed (uniquely, except in the 3potts model)
by requiring a minimal number of nonpf sectors (which
necessarily correspond to one or two unphysical bound-
ary conditions). that minimal number is denoted by
nnonpf. the results are as follows.

in the model (ap1, dq/2+1) (we have looked at the
eight models corresponding to 6  q  12), the number
nunphys(p, q) only depends on the rank of the d factor. it
increases rather quickly since it is equal to 1, 3, 6 and 10
for the two models involving the algebra d4, d5, d6 and
d7 respectively. we found that the unphysical boundary

conditions form the set (the labelling of the nodes is as
in the gure of section iii)

{ = (a, b)  t p1

2

 a q

2 1 : a + b  p+3

2 }.

(7.10)

moreover, the signs which make the number of nonpf
sectors minimal are unique and given by

 = (+1, 1, +1, 1, . . .)a  (1, 1, 1, . . .)b

= (1)a+1,

 = (a, b).

(7.11)

as pointed out above, in the model (a4, d4), there is
another solution  = (+1, 1, +1, +1), which however
appears to contradict the duality relations (see below).

we have determined nnonpf by mere counting, and
found that it equals 2, 3, 11, 15, 36, 46, 89, 109 for
the rst eight models, ordered as (a4, d4), (a6, d4),
(a6, d5), ... (by symmetry, the sectors (, ) and (, )
are identical and count for one.)

these results strongly suggest the general pattern in
which the number of boundary conditions in (7.10) equals
a binomial coecient

nunphys(a, d q

2 +1) =(cid:18) q

2  1

2 (cid:19).

(7.12)

this is a large number since essentially half the invari-
ant boundary conditions would have to be discarded as
classically unphysical. a bit more of numerology also
shows that the number of nonpf sectors ts the simple
formula

nnonpf(aq11, d q

2 +1) =

(cid:8)( q2

4 )4(cid:9) + q(q2)(q2)(q4)

192

,

(7.13)

where {x} is the integer closest to x. the two numbers in
the r.h.s. of the previous equation have separately a well
dened meaning: the rst one is the number of sectors
where the ground state is nondegenerate but odd under
the z2 symmetry, while the second one gives the number
of sectors where the ground state is doubly degenerate.
the reader may wish to check the above assertions in
a less simple instance than the potts model. a good
example is to consider the (a6, d5) model, for which one
computes (in the tensor product basis)

10the unicity of the largest eigenvalue is guaranteed only
for nonnegative primitive matrices [16]. under mild assump-
tions on the transfer matrix, its irreducibility is sucient.

the values of  mentioned in (7.11) are nothing but
the rst line of m,, and the boundary conditions to
discard label the rows and columns 6, 8 and 9, which

11

correspond, in terms of the xed point graph t3  a3,
to the pairs of nodes (a, b) = (3, 2), (2, 3) and (3, 3), as
announced in (7.10). there are 6 zeros in the upper
triangular part of m,, which is the value of the second
summand of (7.13).

all this leads to the reasonable guess that (7.11) might
give the correct physical values of the s. inserted in
(6.9), it not only determines the parities of all primaries
in the sectors where the pf criterion is satised, but
it also points to the boundary conditions that can have
a problematic lattice interpretation. these conjectural
statements must be conrmed or dismissed by the ex-
plicit calculation of the boundary boltzmann weights.
the results obtained so far seem to give some support
to our conjecture [18].

assuming this conjecture, it is not dicult to give an
explicit formula for the parities. from (4.6), (4.12) and
(7.11), they are determined from

n(g) i
(a1,b1),(a2,b2) = (1)a1+a2+r+1 

ur1(t (p1)

2

)a1,a2 us1(a q

2 1)b1,b2 .

(7.15)

the matrices ur1(t(p1)/2) are all positive, unlike the
us1(aq/21), which are positive for s < q/2, negative
for s > q/2, and identically zero for s = q/2, on account
of uqs1(aq/21) = us1(aq/21).

putting all these observations together, one can con-
clude that the paired elds have opposite z2 parities
within each pair (as already pointed out), and that the
parity of an unpaired eld in the sector of boundary con-
ditions ,  is equal to

g(

i ) =( (1)a1+a2+r+1 

(1)a1+a2+r 

i

i

if s < q/2,

if s > q/2.

(7.16)

in the critical 3potts model for instance, one nds the
following frustrated partition functions (in terms of the
conformal weights)

z g
z g
z g
z g
z g
z g
z g
z g

a,a = 0  3,
a,bc = 2/5  7/5,
a,free = 1/8  13/8,
bc,bc = 0  3  2/5 + 7/5,
bc,free = 1/40  21/40,
free,free = 0  3 + 2/3  2/3+ ,
a,new = 1/40  21/40,
new,new = 0  3  2/5 + 7/5

(7.20)

(7.21)

(7.22)

(7.23)

+2/3  2/3+ + 1/15  1/15+ .

(7.24)

these functions are computed using the s given in
(7.11), and appear to be consistent with the duality of
the model [6]. for instance, the equality

zbc,free = za,new

(7.25)

is maintained for the frustrated partition functions, while

zfree,free = za,a + za,b + za,c

(7.26)

becomes z g

free,free = z g

a,a since z g

a,b = z g

a,c = 0.

the use of the other solution  = (+1, 1, +1, +1)
has the eect of multiplying by 1 the partition functions
of all sectors with one new, so that z g
a,new would be
minus the expression in (7.23), contradicting the duality
relation (7.25).

there is a z3 symmetry in two models only, namely
the critical and tricritical 3potts models (a4, d4) and
(a6, d4).
they possess respectively 2 (free and
new) and 3 invariant boundary conditions, namely
 = (a, 2) for a a node of t2 and t3. the relevant m
matrices are equal to

m, =(cid:16) +1 1

1 +1(cid:17) and   +1 +1 1
1 1 +1!,

+1 +1 1

(7.27)

where a 1 sign indicates that the corresponding sector
has two degenerate ground states, of opposite and non
zero charge (none of them is invariant under the z3).

in the rst case (the (a4, d4) model), it is the second
boundary condition (2, 2) (i.e. new) that appears to
be unphysical, while in the second case, it is the third
boundary condition (3, 2). this should not be surprising
since they are precisely the boundary conditions which
were unphysical from the z2 point of view: from (7.10),
 = (a, 2) was to be discarded if a + 2  (p + 3)/2,
that is, if a = (p  1)/2. therefore, the boundary con-
ditions which were causing problems for the z2 charges
also cause problems for the z3 charges.

c. the unitary models (a,e6)

we will content ourselves with making a few comments
on the two unitary models (a10, e6) and (a12, e6) (p =
11 or 13, and q = 12).

as we have said above, the models involving the e6
algebra have the peculiarity of possessing primary elds
that occur with multiplicity 1, 2 and 3.
it turns out
that the same is true of the ground state in various sec-
tors. let us examine in some detail the simplest model
(a10, e6).

that model possesses 10 invariant boundary condi-
tions, labelled as  = (a, b) with a = 1, 2, . . . , 5 a node of
t5, and b = 3, 6 a node of the a2 subgraph of e6, xed by
its nontrivial automorphism. one can compute as be-
fore the matrix m, which collects those entries of n(g) i
,
for which i is the lowest weight primary in the sector , .
the result is

m, =

where the stars mean that the ground state in the corre-
sponding sector is three times degenerate, the number 1
being the sum of the three parities. as before, a zero in-
dicates that there are two degenerate ground states with
opposite parity.

we can repeat what we did for the (a, d) series, and
look for a set of  which minimizes the violation of the
pf criterion.

by varying the , one nds that the minimal number
of nonpf sectors is equal to 21, and that the nonpf
sectors have at least one boundary condition in the set

{(2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (5, 6)}

(7.29)

in terms of the nodes of t5  a2 (they correspond to the
rows and columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 10). so these ve boundary
conditions can presumably be called unphysical in the
sense of the previous subsection. hence

nunphys(a10, e6) = 5, nnonpf(a10, e6) = 21. (7.30)

there are four solutions for the s for which these
values can be realized. among them, the most symmet-
rical one is  = (+1, 1, 1, +1, 1)  (1, 1).

the other model (a12, e6) is similar. one nds

nunphys(a12, e6) = 5, nnonpf(a12, e6) = 27. (7.31)

the presumably unphysical boundary conditions corre-
spond to the nodes (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (6,6) of
t6  a2. the signs for which these numbers are reached
are unique and given by  = (+1, 1, +1, +1, 1, +1) 
(1, 1).
