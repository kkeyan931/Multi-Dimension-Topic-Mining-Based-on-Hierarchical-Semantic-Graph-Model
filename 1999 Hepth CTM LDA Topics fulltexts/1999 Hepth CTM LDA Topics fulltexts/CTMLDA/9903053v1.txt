abstract

we describe local mirror symmetry from a mathematical point of view and make sev-

eral a-model calculations using the mirror principle (localization). our results agree with

b-model computations from solutions of picard-fuchs dierential equations constructed

form the local geometry near a fano surface within a calabi-yau manifold. we interpret

the gromov-witten-type numbers from an enumerative point of view. we also describe

the geometry of singular surfaces and show how the local invariants of singular surfaces

agree with the smooth case when they occur as complete intersections.

1. introduction

local mirror symmetry refers to a specialization of mirror symmetry techniques

to address the geometry of fano surfaces within calabi-yau manifolds. the procedure

produces certain invariants associated to the surfaces. this paper is concerned with

the proper denition and interpretation of these invariants. the techniques we develop

are a synthesis of results of previous works (see [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]), with several new

constructions. we have not found a cohesive explanation of local mirror symmetry in the

literature. we oer this description in the hope that it will add to our understanding

of the subject and perhaps help to advance local mirror symmetry towards higher genus

computations.

mirror symmetry, or the calculation of gromov-witten invariants in calabi-yau three-
folds,1 can now be approached in the traditional (b-model) way or by using localization

techniques. the traditional approach involves solving the picard-fuchs equations gov-

erning the behavior of period integrals of a calabi-yau manifold under deformations of

complex structure, and converting the coecients of the solutions near a point of maximal

monodromy into gromov-witten invariants of the mirror manifold. localization tech-

niques, rst developed by kontsevich [6] and then improved by others [7][8], oer a proof

 without reference to a mirror manifold  that the numbers one obtains in this way are

indeed the gromov-witten invariants as dened via the moduli space of maps.

likewise, local mirror symmetry has these two approaches. one nds that the mirror

geometry is a riemann surface with a meromorphic dierential. from this one is able

to derive dierential equations which yield the appropriate numerical invariants. recall

the geometry. we wish to study a neighborhood of a surface s in a calabi-yau three-

fold x, then take a limit where this surface shrinks to zero size. in the rst papers on the

subject, these equations were derived by rst nding a calabi-yau manifold containing the

surface, then nding its mirror and specializing the picard-fuchs equations by taking

an appropriate limit corresponding to the local geometry. learning from this work, one is

now able to write down the dierential equations directly from the geometry of the surface

(if it is toric). we use this method to perform our b-model calculations.

we employ a localization approach developed in [8] for computing the gromov-witten-

type invariants directly (the a-model). since the adjunction formula and the calabi-yau

1 we restrict the term mirror symmetry to mean an equivalence of quantum rings, rather

than the more physical interpretation as an isomorphism of conformal eld theories.

2

condition of x tell us that the normal bundle of the surface is equal to the canonical bundle

(in the smooth case), the local geometry is intrinsic to the surface. we dene the gromov-

witten-type invariants directly from ks, following [7] [8]. we require s to be fano (this
should be related to the condition that s be able to vanish in x), which makes the bundle

ks concave, thus allowing us to construct cohomology classes on moduli space of maps.
we consider the numbers constructed in this way to be of gromov-witten type.

in section two, we review the mirror principle and apply it to the calculation of

invariants for several surfaces. in section three, we give the general procedure for toric

varieties. we then calculate the invariants by hand for a few cases, as a way of checking

and illucidating the procedure. in section ve, we describe the excess intersection formula

and show that the local invariants simply account for the eective contribution to the

number of curves in a calabi-yau due to the presence of a holomorphic surface.

in section six, we develop all the machinery for performing b-model calculations with-

out resorting to a specialization of period equations from a compact calabi-yau containing

the relevant local geometry. actually, a natural weierstrass compactication exists for

toric fano geometries, and its decompactication (the limit of large elliptic ber) produces

expressions intrinsic to the surface. in this sense, the end result makes no use of compact

data. the procedure closely resembles the compact b-model technique of solving dier-

ential equations and taking combinations of solutions with dierent singular behaviors to

produce a prepotential containing enumerative invariants as coecients. many examples

are included.

in order to accommodate readers with either mathematical or physical backgrounds,

we have tried to be reasonably self-contained and have included several examples written

out in considerable detail. algebraic geometers may nd these sections tedious, and may

content themselves with the more general sections (e.g., 3, 4.2, 6.3). physicists wishing

to get a feel for the mathematics of a-model computations may choose to focus on the

examples of section 4.1.

2. overview of the a-model

in this section, we review the techniques for calculating invariants using localization.

we will derive the numbers and speak loosely about their interpretation, leaving more

rigorous explanations and interpretations for later sections.

for smooth hypersurfaces in toric varieties, we dene the gromov-witten invariants

to be chern classes of certain bundles over the moduli space of maps, dened as follows.
let m0,0( ~d; p) be kontsevichs moduli space of stable maps of genus zero with no marked
points. a point in this space will be denoted (c, f ), where f : c  p, p is some toric
variety, and [f (c)] = ~d  h2(p). let m0,1( ~d; p) be the same but with one marked point.
consider the diagram

m0,0( ~d; p)  m0,1( ~d; p)  p,

where p is the toric variety in question,

ev : m0,1( ~d; p)  p

is the evaluation map sending (c, f, ) 7 f (), and

 : m0,1( ~d; p)  m0,0( ~d; p)

is the forgetting map sending (c, f, ) 7 (c, f ). let q be a calabi-yau dened as the zero
locus of sections of a convex2 bundle v over p. then u ~d is the bundle over m0,0( ~d; p)
dened by

u ~d = evv.

the bers of u ~d over (c, f ) are h 0(c, f v ). we dene the kontsevich numbers kd by

kd zm0,0( ~d;p)

c(u ~d).

it is most desirable when dim m0,0( ~d; p) = ranku ~d, so that kd is the top chern class.

the mirror principle is a procedure for evaluating the numbers kd by a fancy version
of localization. the idea, pursued in the next section, is as follows. when all spaces and

bundles are torically described, the moduli spaces and the bundles we construct over them

inherit torus actions (e.g., by moving the image curve). thus, the integrals we dene can

be localized to the xed point loci. as we shall see in the next section, the multiplicativity

of the characteristic classes we compute implies relations among their restrictions to the

xed loci. the reason for this is that the xed loci of degree  maps includes stable

curves constructed by gluing degree  and  maps, with  +  = . one then constructs

2 convex means that h 1(c, f v ) = 0 for (c, f )  m0,0( ~d; p). for the simplest example,

p = p4 and v = o(5), as in the next subsection.

4

an equivariant map to a linear sigma model, which is an easily described toric space.

indeed, the linear sigma model is another compactication of the smooth stable maps,

wihch can be modeled as polynomial maps. we then push/pull our problem to this linear

sigma model, where the same gluing relations are found to hold. the notion of euler

data is any set of characteristic classes on the linear sigma model obeying these relations.

they are not strong enough to uniquely determine the classes, but as the equivariant

cohomology can be modeled as polynomials, two sets of euler data which agree upon

restriction to enough points may be thought of as equivalent (linked euler data). it is

not dicult to construct euler data linked to the euler data of the characteristic classes in

which we are interested. relating the linked euler data, and therefore solving the problem

in terms of simply-constructed polynomial classes, is done via a mirror transform, which

involves hypergeometric series familiar to b-model computations. however, no b-model

constructions are used. these polynomial classes can easily be integrated, the answers

then related to the numbers in which we are interested by the mirror transform. this

procedure is used to evaluate the examples in this section which follow, as well as all other

a-model calculations.

using the techniques of the mirror principle, we are able to build euler data from many

linked euler data for the bundle u ~d whose bers over a point (f, c) in m0,0(d; pn) is a

bundles over toric varieties. typically, we have a direct sum of li o(li) and lj o(kj)
over pn, with li, kj > 0. in such a case, if pi li +pj kj = n + 1 then we can obtain
direct sum of li h 0(c, f o(li)) and lj h 1(c, f o(kj)). in this situation, the rank of
the bundle (which is pi(dli + 1) +pj(dkj  1)) may be greater than the dimension d

of m0,0(d; pn) (which is d  (n + 1)(d + 1)  4). in that case, we compute the integral
over moduli space of the chern class cd(u ~d). the interpretations will be discussed in the
examples.

we begin with a convex bundle.

2.1. o(5)  p4

recall that this is the classic mirror symmetry calculation. we compute this by using
j=1(5h  m) as the rank of ud equals the dimension of moduli
space, we take the top chern class of the bundle and call this kd. this has the standard
interpretation: given a generic section with isolated zeros, the chern class counts the

the euler data pd = q5d

number of zeros. if we take as a section the pull back of a quintic polynomial (which is a

global section of o(5)), then its zeros will be curves (c, f ) on which the section vanishes

5

identically. as the section vanishes along a calabi-yau quintic three-fold, the curve must

be mapped (with degree d) into the quintic  thus we have the interpretation as number

of rational curves. however, the contribution of curves of degree d/k, when k divides d, is

also non-zero. in this case, we can compose any kfold cover of the curve c with a map f

of degree d/k into the quintic. this contribution is often called the excess intersection.

to calculate the contribution to the chern class, we must look at how this space of kfold
covers of c (which, as c = p1 in the smooth case, is equal to m0,0(k, p1)) sits in the
moduli space (i.e. look at its normal bundle). this calculation yields 1/k3, and so if nd is

the number of rational curves of degree d in the quintic, we actually count

nd/k
k3 .

kd =xk|d

(2.1)

this double cover formula will be discussed in detail in section 5.1.

in the appendix, several examples of other bundles over projective spaces are worked

out. in the cases where the rank of ud is greater (by n) than the dimension of moduli

space, we take the highest chern class that we can integate. the resulting numbers count

the number of zeros of s0  ...  sn, i.e. the places where n + 1 generic sections gain linear

dependencies. a zero of s0  ...  sn represents a point (c, f ) in moduli space where f (c)

vanishes somewhere in the n-dimensional linear system of s0, ..., sn. see the appendix for

details. we turn now to the study of some concave bundles.

2.2. o(3)  p2

we think of o(3) as kp2 , the canonical bundle. this case is relevant to calabi-

yau manifolds containing projective surfaces. a tubular neighborhood of the surface is

equivalent to the total space of the canonical bundle (by the adjunction formula and the

calabi-yau condition c1 = 0).

in this case, the rank of ud (which is the bundle whose ber over (c, f ) is

h 1(c, f kp2)) is equal to the dimension of moduli space, so we are computing the top

chern class kd =rm0,0(d,p2) c3d1(ud). from the kds we arrive at the following nds.

table 1: local invariants for kp2

the intepretation for the nds is not as evident as for positive bundles, since no sections

of ud can be pulled back from sections of the canonical bundle (which has no sections).

instead, we have the following interpretation.

suppose the p2 exists within a calabi-yau manifold, and we are trying to count the

number of curves in the same homology class as d times the hyperplane in p2. the analysis

for the calabi-yau would go along the lines of the quintic above. however, there would

necessarily be new families of zeros of your section corresponding to the families of degree

d curves in the p2 within the calabi-yau. these new families would be isomorphic to

m0,0(d, p2). on this space, we have to compute the contribution to the total chern class.

to do this, we would need to use the excess intersection formula. the result (see section

5.2) is precisely given by the kd. let us call once again nd the integers derived from the kd.

suppose now that we have two calabi-yaus, x0 and x1, in the same family of complex
structures, one of which (say x1 contains) a p2. then the dierence between nd(x0) and

nd(x1) should be given by the nd.

there are calabi-yaus, however, which generically contain a p2. the simplest ex-

amples are the following elliptic berations over a p2, a.) the degree 18 hypersurface
in denoted by p6,9,1,1,1[18], with  = 540, h21 = 272, h11 = 2(0) b.) p3,6,1,1,1[12],
 = 324, h21 = 165, h11 = 3(1) c.) p3,3,1,1,1[9],  = 216, h21 = 112, h11 = 4(2). h11

contributions in brackets are non-toric divisors, in these cases they correspond to additional

components of the section, see below.

table 2: invariants of the three elliptic brations over p2 (b and f denote the class of a section

and the elliptic ber, respectively.)

for such calabi-yaus the gromov-witten invariants of the homology class of the base

would be a multiple of the invariants for kbase. in the above examples, we see from the
rst column the dierent multiples which arise as we are counting curves in the homology
class of a curve which is dual to the hyperplane class of the base p2. this homology class

sits inside a section of the elliptic bration, and the multiplicities come from the fact that

the a, b, c brations admit 1, 2, 3 sections. for example, if we write the ambient toric

variety for case c as p(op2  op2  op2 (3)), a section is given by one of the three

components of the vanishing locus of the coordinate on the ber that transforms as o(3)
over p2.

another interpretation of this number is as follows. the space h 1(c, f k) represents

obstructions to deformations of the curve c. therefore, the top chern class of the bundle
whose bers are h 1(c, f k) represents the number of innitesimal deformations in the

family which represent nite deformations. note this interpretation is equivalent to the one

above. the numbers represent the eective number of curves of degree d in the calabi-yau
coming from the p2.

this procedure can be performed for any fano surface. the hirzebruch (rational,

ruled) surfaces are described in the appendix a. next we discuss the general toric case.

3. the mirror principle for general toric manifolds

in this section, we review the mirror principle for computations of gromov-witten

invariants of a toric variety. for a summary of what follows, we refer the reader to the start

of section 2. we explain most of the ingredients leading to a formula for the invariants.

8

our treatment is somewhat more general than that of [8], as we consider general toric

varieties, though we omit some proofs which will be included in [9] .

throughout this section, we take a smooth, toric and projective manifold p as our

target manifold. that is, we are interested in rational curves that map into p.

let us write p as a quotient of an open ane variety:

p =

cnc  

g

,

where g = (c)nc m . there is a t  (s1)nc action on p induced from the usual action
on cnc . there are nc xed points of this action in p which we will denote by p1, ..., pnc .
for example, for p = p4, t is (s1)5 and the xed points are the points with one coordinate

nonvanishing.

since we will be computing in equivariant cohomology, it is useful to have an explicit

presentation of the t-equivariant cohomology ring of p. this can be obtained from the

ordinary ring by the following procedure. write the ordinary ring as a quotient

q[b1, ..., bnc ]

i

,

with bi being the divisor class of xi = 0 and i an ideal generated by elements homogeneous
in bis. in the case of p4 this is just

(b1  b2, b1  b3, b1  b4, b1  b5, b1b2b3b4b5)

q[b1, ..., b5]

.

we can ignore the linear relations in i by choosing a basis ji of h 2(p, z) and writing bi
in terms of the jks:

furthermore, the ith (c)-action in g acts on cnc as follows, where  is an arbitary
element of (c):

bi =x bijjj.

(x1, ..., xnc )  (qi,1x1, ..., qi,nc xnc )

the equivariant ring is then

ht(p) =

q[1, ..., m , 1, ..., nc ]

it

9

,

where it is generated by p qi,jj for i = 1, ..., nc and the nonlinear relations in i with
bi replaced by p bijj  i. in the case of p4 , this gives
(q5
i=1(  i),p i)

if we set i to 0 in ht(p), we recover the ordinary ring and j can be identied with jj.

q[, 1, ..., 5]

.

having described the base and the torus action, we also need a bundle v to dene the

appropriate gromov-witten problem. for instance, if we are interested in rational curves

in a complete intersection of divisors in p, then v is a direct sum of the associated line

bundles. for local mirror symmetry, we can also take a concave line bundle as a component
of v . more generally, we take v = v +  v , with v + convex and v  concave.

before proceeding to the next section, we introduce some notation for later use. let

fj be the associated divisors of the line bundle summands of v , by associating each line

bundle to a divisor in the usual way. we write fj as greater or less than zero, depending

on whether it is convex or concave. homology classes of curves in p will be written in
the basis hj poincare dual to jj . for instance, m0,0( ~d; p) is the moduli space of stable

maps with image homology classp dihi. finally, x denotes a formal variable for the total

chern class.

3.1. fixed points and a gluing identity

the pull-back of v to m0,1( ~d; p) by the evaluation map gives a bundle of the form
ev(v +)  ev(v ). then, in terms of the forgetful map from m0,1( ~d; p) to m0,0( ~d; p),
we obtain a bundle on m0,0( ~d; p) ev(v +)r1ev(v ). the latter is the obstruction
bundle u ~d.

on m0,0( ~d; p), there is a torus action induced by the action on p, i.e. by moving the
image curve under the torus action. a typical xed point of this action is (f, p1)3, where
f (p1) is a p1 joining two t-xed points in p.

another type of xed point we consider is obtained by gluing. let (f1, c1, x1) 
m0,1(~r; p) and (f2, c2, x2)  m0,1( ~d  ~r; p) be two xed points. then f1(x1) is a xed
point of p, i.e. one of the pis, say pk. if f2(x2) is also pk, let us glue them at the marked
points to obtain (f, c1  c2)  m0,0( ~d; p), where f |c1 = f1, f |c2 = f2 and f (x1 x2) = pk.

3 we apologize for reversing notation from the previous section, and writing (f, c) instead of

(c, f ). this is to agree with [8] which we closely follow in this section.

10

clearly, (f, c1  c2) is a xed point as (f1, c1, x1) and (f2, c2, x2) are xed points. let
us denote the loci of xed points obtained by gluing as above f l(pk, ~r, ~d  ~r).

over c1  c2, there is an exact sequence for v :

0  f v  f 

1 v  f 

2 v  v |f1(x1)=f2(x2)  0.

the long exact cohomology sequence then gives us a gluing identity

v

tct(u ~d) = ct(u~r)ct(u ~d~r),

(3.1)

(3.2)

where v

t = ct(v +)/ct(v ) is the t-equivariant chern class of v .

this relation will generate one on the linear sigma model to which we now turn.

3.2. the spaces m ~d and n ~d

because m0,0( ~d; p) is a rather unwieldy space, the gluing identity we found in the
last section seems not to be useful. however, we will nd, using the gluing identity, a
similar identity on a toric manifold n ~d. we devote this section mainly to describing n ~d
and its relation to m0,0( ~d; p).

first we consider m ~d  m0,0((1, ~d); p1 p). we will call 1 and 2 the projections to
the rst and second factors of p1  p respectively. since 2 maps to p, one might consider
a map from m ~d to m0,0( ~d; p) sending (f, c) to (2  f, c). however, this is not necessarily
a stable map. if it is unstable, 2  f maps some components of c to points, so if we let c
be the curve obtained by deleting these components, there is a map  : m ~d  m0,0( ~d; p)
which sends (f, c) to (2  f, c).

let us now recall some facts about maps from p1. a regular map to p is equivalently
a choice of generic sections of op1 (f bi hp1 ), i = 1, ..., nc. for example, a map of degree
d from p1 to p4 gives ve generic sections of op1 (d), i.e., ve degree d polynomials. if

one takes ve arbitary sections, constrained only by being not all identically zero, one gets
a rational map instead. generalizing this, arbitrary sections of op1 (f bi  hp1 ) which
are not in  give rational maps to p. the space n ~d is the space of all such maps with
f (ji) = dijp1 , where jp1  hp1 = 1. explicitly, we can write it as a quotient space.

dening d =p djhj, we have

n ~d =

ih 0(p1, o(bi  d))  

g

11

.

(3.3)

there is a map  : m ~d  n ~d, which we now describe. take (f, c)  m ~d and
decompose c as a union c0  c1  ...  cn of not neccesarily irreducible curves, so that cj
for j > 0 meets c0 at a point, and c0 is isomorphic to p1 under 1  f . since c0 = p1,

2  f |c0 can be regarded as a point in n[2f (c0)], where [] denotes the homology class

of . we can also represent 2  f |cj for j > 0 by elements in n[2f (cj )], except that

since the maps are to have domain c0, in this case we take the rational map from c0 that

vanishes only at xj = cj  c0 and belongs to n[2f (cj )].

having now n + 1 representatives, compose them via the map

n~r1  n~r2  n~r1+~r2

given by multiplying sections of o(bi). the result, since pn

in n ~d. thus we have obtained a map from m ~d to n ~d.

i=0[2  f (ci)] = d, is a point

to illustrate, let us take the case of p4 again. here (f, c) is a degree (1, d) map.

let us decompose c as before into c0  ...  cn , with xi = ci  c0 and 1  f |c0 an

isomorphism. the image of  is a rational morphism given as a map by 2  f |c0 except
at the points xi. at xi, a generic hyperplane of p4 pulled back vanishes to the order given

by the multiplicity of [2  f (ci)] in terms of a generator.

so far we have discussed the spaces and the maps between them. we now briey
describe the torus actions they admit. clearly, m ~d has an s1  t action induced from an
action on p1  p. in suitable coordinates, the s1 action is [w0, w1]  [ew0, w1].

since sections of op1 (1) is also a one-dimensional projective space, there is an s1
action on h 0(p1, op1 (1)). this induces an action on sections of op1 (d). n ~d is dened
by the latter, so it admits an s1 action. in addition, it has a t-action induced from the

action on o(bi).

the map  is obviously t-equivariant, since the t-actions are induced from p. it is

shown in [9] that  is (s1  t)-equivariant. summarizing, we have the following maps:



n ~d

 mvecd


 m0,0( ~d; p)


 m0,1( ~d; p)

ev
 p.

pushing and pulling our problem to n ~d, we dene q ~d = !ct(u ~d).

12

3.3. euler data

in this section we will derive from the gluing identity a simpler identity on n ~d. recall
that the gluing identity holds over xed loci f l(pi, ~r, ~d  ~r)  m0,0( ~d; p). therefore, an
identity holds over 1(f l(pi, ~r, ~d  ~r)) in m ~d under pull-back by . we next turn to
describing a sublocus of 1(f l(pi, ~r, ~d  ~r)) which, as we will see later is mapped by 
to a xed point in n ~d.

let fpi,~r denote the xed point loci in m0,1(~r; p) with the marked point mapped to
pi. let (f1, c1, x1)  fpi,~r and (f2, c2, x2)  fpi, ~d~r be two points. we dene a point
(f, c) in m ~d as follows. for c we take (c0  p1)  c1  c2, with c0  c1 = x1 and
c0  c2 = x2. for the map f , we dene it by giving the projections 1  f and 2  f . we
require 1  f (c1) = 0, 1  f (c2) =  and 1  f |c0 be an isomorphism. this xes
1 f , since any other choice is related by an automorphism of the domain curve preserving
x1 and x2, which is irrelevant in m ~d. we require 2  f to map c1 as f1, c2 as f2 and c0
to f1(x1). clearly,  maps (f, c) to a point in f l(pi, ~r, ~d  ~r). let us denote the loci of
such (f, c)s by m f l(pi, ~r, ~d  ~r). by construction, it is isomorphic to fpi,~r  fpi, ~d~r.

we verify (f, c) is a xed point. fi(ci) and pi are xed in p, so f is t-xed. the
s1-action xes only 0 and  on the rst factor of p1  p. nevertheless, the point (f, c0 
c1  c2) remains xed under the s1 action, as we need to divide out by automorphisms
of c0 preserving x1 and x2.

we now compare the maps just constructed with the xed points of n ~d. it will be
most convenient to do so by describing the latter in terms of rational morphisms. so take
a point in n ~d, viewed as a rational morphism from c0  p1. let x1, ..., xn be the points
where it is undened. at xi, the chosen sections of o(bj  d) vanish to certain orders,

including possibly zero. a generic section of o(jj  d) = o(dj) vanishes to order, say rj

at x1. any section of a line bundle o(l) pulled back by the map then vanishes at x1 at

least to order l p rjhj.

therefore the rational morphism is equivalent to the data of a regular map from c0

and a curve class for each bad point. the classes for the bad points indicate the multiplicity

of vanishing of a generic section of a pulled-back line bundle. altogether, the class of the

image of the regular map and the curve classes we associate to the bad points sum to d,

since a generic section of o(l) must have exactly l  d zeroes.

now we can deduce the xed points of n ~d. the t-action moves the image of a rational
morphism, whereas the s1 action rotates the domain p1 about an axis joining 0 and .

13

so a xed point is a rational map, undened at 0 and , whose image is a xed point of

p. let us denote them by pi,~r, where pi denotes a xed point of p, andp rihi determines

orders of vanishing of pulled-back line bundles at the point 0  p1. clearly,  maps the
xed points in m ~d discussed earlier to the xed point pi,~r.

we now use the atiyah-bott formula for localization to relate restrictions of q ~d to

pi,~r (which we denote by q ~d(pi,~r)) to ct(u ~d). explicitly,

q ~d(pi,~r) =zn ~d

pi,~r q ~d =zm ~d

(pi,~r )ct((u ~d)).

where pi,~r is the equivariant thom class of the normal bundle of pi,~r in n ~d. to evaluate
the last integral, we need to compute the equivariant euler class of the normal bundle of
m f l(pi, ~r, ~d  ~r) in m ~d.

since m f l(pi, ~r, ~d  ~r) = fpi,~r  fpi, ~d~r, we have contributions from the normal
bundles of fpi,~r  m0,1(~r; p) and fpi, ~d~r  m0,1( ~d  ~r; p). they are respectively
e(n (fpi,~r/m0,1(~r; p))) and e(n (fpi, ~d~r/m0,1( ~d~r; p))). points in m f l(pi, ~r, ~d~r) have
domain of the form c0 c1 c2, where c1 c0 = x1, and c2 c0 = x2. now let l~r denote
the line bundle on m0,1(~r; p) whose ber at (f1, c1, x1) is the tangent line at x1. then we
can write the contributions from deforming x1 and x2 as e(l~r  tx1 c0) =  + c1(l~r) and
 + c1(l ~d~r), respectively. in addition, automorphisms of c0 which do not x x1 and x2
need to be included. they can be shown to give weights of tx1 c0 and tx2 c0, so there is an
extra factor of ()(). finally, normal directions which move the image of the marked

point from pi have to be excluded, so we divide by the weights of tpip.

this yields, after using

v (pi)q ~d(pi,~r) =

1

2 e(tpi p)e(pi,~r/n ~d) xfpi,~rzfpi,~r
xfpi, ~d~rzfpi, ~d~r

ct(u ~d~r)

e(n (fpi, ~d~r))( + c1(l ~d~r))

ct(u~r)

e(n (f~r))( + c1(l~r))

.

we introduce some more notation. let j, ~d be the member of the s1  t equivariant
cohomology ring of n ~d whose weight at the xed point pi,~r is j(pi) + rj. clearly,
j,~0  j . the identity e(tpi p)e(pi,~r/n ~d) = e(pi,~r/n~r)e(pi,~0/n ~d~r) then implies

v (pi)q ~d(pi,~r) = q~r(pi,~0)q ~d~r(pi,~0).

(3.4)

14

is an automorphism of the s1  t equivariant cohomology ring with
here the overbar
 =  and j, ~d = j, ~d. a sequence of equivariant cohomology classes satisfying (3.4) is
called in [8] a set of v -euler data.

3.4. linked euler data

if we knew the values of q ~d at all xed points, we would also know q ~d as a class.
since we do not know this, we will use equivariance to compute q ~d at certain points, for
example, those that correspond to the t-invariant p1s in p. it turns out that this is also
sucient, as we will nd euler data which agree with q ~d at those points, and a suitable
comparison between the two gives us the rest.

before we begin the computation, we rst describe a t-equivariant map from n~0 = p
to n ~d. aections of o(bi  d) over p1 are polynomials in w0 and w1, where w0 and w1
are as before coordinates so that the s1 action takes the form [w0, w1]  [ew0, w1]. each
polynomial contains a unique monomial invariant under the s1 action. by sending the

coordinates of a point to the coecients of the invariant monomials, we hence obtain a
map i ~d from n~0 to n ~d.

we begin with the case of a convex line bundle o(l), where l denotes the associated
divisor. let (f, p1) be a point in m0,0( ~d; p) with f (p1) being a multiple of the t-invariant
p1 joining pi and pj in p. the ber of the obstruction bundle at (f, p1) is h 0(o(l  d)),
which is spanned in appropriate coordinates for the p1 by uk

, k = 0, ..., l  d.

0uldk

1

choose a basis so that u1 = 0 is mapped to pi, and u0 = 0 mapped to pj. since the
does not vanish at u1 = 0, its weight is equal to the weight of l at pi, which

0

section uld
we denote by l(pi). similarly, uld
is (l(pj)  l(pi))/(l  d), giving us the weights of all sections.

1

has weight l(pj). hence the induced weight on u1/u0

since (f, p1) is xed by t, the corresponding loci (1((f, p1))) in n ~d is, by equiv-
ariance, xed by a dimt subgroup of s1  t. the points in (1((f, p1))) represent a
regular map from a p1 to the t-invariant p1 joining pi and pj . therefore any two points
dier by an automorphism of the domain. explicitly, we can consider coordinates [w0, w1]
as before and the relevant subgroup is found by choosing the element of s1 to cancel the

induced weight of t on u0 and u1, giving  = (l(pi)  l(pj))/(l  d). so we nd that the
value of q ~d is

(x + l(pj) + k).

yk

15

this is the same as the value of p ~d, where p ~d is given by

yk

(x +x lii, ~d + k).

this is because since, by equivariance of i ~d, i, ~d restricts to (1((f, p1))) with the same
weight under (s1  t )/(alpha  (l(pi)  l(pj))/(l  d) as the weight under t of  at the
point with the lowest on the t-invariant p1 which sits in n~0

we can simplify the computations further by doing a partial nonequivariant limit, i.e.
by replacing i with ji. then p ~d reduces to (x, l, l  d + 1, 0), where the  functions
are dened as follows:

(y, k, i, j) =

if i > j

if i = j

.

if i < j

k=j(y + k + (k  1))

k=i (y + k + k)

similarly, the case of a concave line bundle gives (x, l, l  c, 1). for a direct sum,
we simply note that the chern class is multiplicative, and the product of the cases just
considered is a valid euler data, so that the product gives us the correct value of p ~d.

let us form a series:

hga[q]( ~t ) = ep tiji/( xdne(p){0}

i 

d(q ~d)yi

(0, bi, bi  d, 0)ep tijid + ).

(3.6)
a similar series is obtained using p ~d instead of q ~d. here by q ~d we mean its partially
nonequivariant limit, as described above. comparing the series for q and for p to order
1/ determines a transformation, known as a mirror transformation, that relates ~t and ~t.
in [8] it is shown that, this transformation maps one series to the other in all orders in .
so now we know q ~d in terms of p ~d and the ts.

let us begin with a series:

hgb[~t] =ej/ xdne(p)yi

(0, bi, bi  d, 0) yi:fi<0

(x, fi, fi  d, 0)  .

(x, fi, fi  d + 1, 1)ejd

m=1(x + h  m)

m=0 (x  3h + m)

m=1(x + h  m)

(3.8)

(3.9)

here n e(p) is z0h1  ...  z0hm and j = p tiji is an element in h2(p, r), where

ti are real variables.

for the quintic in p4, the curve classes are generated by a unique element c0, so we

can write c = dc0 and sum over all d:

for local mirror symmetry, for example the case of kp2 , we have

we want to compare the two series, so let us expand at large , keeping only terms to
order 1/. it was shown in [9] that an expansion of hga[ ~t ] has the form (1/)(1  j /),
where

 = yfi>0

(x + fi)/yfi<0

(x + fi).

(3.10)

equating the two expressions gives us the b-model coordinates ~t in terms of the a-model
coordinates ~t. then setting hga[ ~t (~t)] = hgb[~t] gives qd as a function of ji and .
another result in [8] implies

4. explicit verication through fixed-point methods

4.1. some examples

though the techniques of section one are extremely powerful, it is often satisfying 

and a good check of ones methods  to do some computations by hand. in this section,

we outline xed point techniques for doing so, and walk through several examples. in this

way, we have veried many of the results in the appendices for low degrees (d = 1, 2, 3).

readers familiar with such exercises may wish to skip to the next subsection.

all the bundles described in section two are equivariant with repsect to the torus t -

action which acts naturally on the toric manifold p. let t  t be a group element acting on
p. then if (c, f, )  m0,1( ~d; p) and (c, f )  m0,0( ~d; p) the induced torus action sends

17

theses points to (c, t  f, ) and (c, t  f ), respectively. the bundle actions are induced by

the natural t -action on the canonical bundle, k.

now that we understand the torus action, what are the xed point theorems? first of

all, we work in the realm of equivariant characteristic classes, which live in the equivariant
cohomology ring h 

t (m ) of a manifold, m. let   h 

t (m ) be an equivariant cohomology

class. the integration formula of atiyah and bott is

zm

 =xp zp (cid:18) i

e(p )(cid:19) ,

p 

where the sum is over xed point sets p, ip is the imbedding in m, and e(p ) is the euler

class of the normal bundle p along p. for p consisting of isolated points and  the chern

class (determinant), we get the ratio of the product of the weights of the t -action on the

bers at p (numerator) over the product of the weights of the t -action on the tangent

bundle to m at p (denominator). one needs only to determine the ber and tangent

bundle at p and gure out the weights.

lets start with degree one (k1) for the quintic (o(5)  p4). let xi 7 i

i xi,
i = 1, ..., 5, be the (c)5 action on c5 (p4 = p(c5)), where ~  (c)5 and the i are the
weights. the xed curves are pij, where i, j run from 1 to 5 : pij = {xk = 0, k 6= i, j}.
since f is a degree one map, we may equate c = f (c) and the pull-back of o(5) is
therefore equal to o(5) on ce. recall the bundle o(5) on p1. its global sections are
degree ve polynomials in the homogeneous coordinates [x, y ], so a convenient basis is
{x ay 5a, a = 0, ..., 5} (or ua in a local coordinate u = x/y ). the weights of these
sections are a + (5  a), if  and  are the weights of the torus (c)2 action on c2. the
map f : ce  p4 looks like [x, y ] 7 [..., x, ..., y, ...] with non-zero entries only in the ith
and jth positions. therefore, the weights of u1 at the xed point (c, f ) are ai +(5a)j ,

a = 0...5. to take the top chern class we take the product of these six weights.

we have to divide this product by the product of the weights of the normal bundle,
which in this case (the image f (c) is smooth) are the weights of h 0(c, f n ), where n
is the normal bundle to f (c). more generally, we take sections of the pull-back of t p4

and remove sections of tc. the normal bundle of pij is equal to o(1)  o(1)  o(1),

each corresponding to a direction normal to f (c) and each of which has two sections. let
w = xj/xi be a coordinate along c = pij on the patch xi 6= 0. if zk = xk/xi is a local
coordinate of p4, then delk  
is a normal vector eld on c with weight k  i. wk
zk

18

is the other normal vector eld corresponding to the direction k, and has weight k  j.

summing over the (cid:18) 5

2(cid:19) = 20 choices of image curve pij gives us
k1 =x(ij) q5

qk6=i,j(k  i)(k  j)

a=0[ai + (5  a)j]

= 2875,

the familiar result.

lets try degree two (k2) for kp2 . the dimension of m0,0(d; p2) is 3d  1 = 5 for
d = 2. what are the xed points? well, the image of (c, f ) must an invariant curve, so
there are two choices for degree two. either the image is a smooth p1 or the union of two

p1s. there are three xed points on p2 and therefore (cid:18) 3

2(cid:19) = 3 invariant pijs. if the

image is a smooth p1, the domain curve may either be a smooth p1, in which case the
map is a double cover (lets call this case 1a), or it may have two component p1s joined

at a node (lets call this case 1b). if the image has two components, the domain must as

well. lets call this case 2.

for case 1a, the situation is similar to the quintic case above. the tangent space to

moduli space consists of sections of h 0(c, f n ),

where n is the normal bundle to the image curve. that is, we take h 0(c, f t p2)
= o(2)  o(1) and f is a degree 2
and delete those sections from h 0(t c). since t p2|f (c)
map, we have f t p2 = o(4)  o(2), which has 5 + 3 = 8 sections. t c = o(2) has three
sections, leaving us with ve total. if f (c) = pij, then the o(2) sections are k, wk, w2k,
where k 6= i, j, w is the coordinate on c, and zm = xm/xi are inhomogeneous coordinates
on p2. the degree two map is, in these coordinates, w 7 (zj = w2, zk = 0). note that
k is the only non-vanishing section at w = 0, and the others are obtained by successive

multiplications by w. notice that w inherits the weight (j  i)/2 by requiring equivari-

ance. the weights are, so far, i  k, (i + j)/2  k, j  k. for the o(4) sections, the

procedure is similar, only we must remove the weights 0, (i = j)/2, as these correspond
to the tangent vectors w, ww, w2w. we are left with (j  i) giving a total of ve.

the weights of h 1(c, f kp2 ) are easily calculated for the curve c by using serre

duality. that is, if one thinks (naively) of sections of a vector bundle e as elements of

 cohomology, and recalling that the canonical bundle k is the bundle of holomorphic
top forms, then h k(e) pairs with h nk(e  k) by wedging and contracting e with
its dual e, then integrating. thus, h k(e) = h nk(e  k). for a curve, c, we

19

have h 1(f kp2 ) = h 0(f k 1
kc = op1 (2), so f k 1

p2  kc = o(2  (+3)  2) = o(4), and the ve sections

p2  kc). lets compute. k 1

p2

= o(3) as a bundle, and

can be obtained in the usual way once we have a non-vanishing one at w = 0. such


zj

 
a section is
 dw, and has weight 2i  j  k + (j  i)/2. in all, then the
zk
weights of h 0(f k 1
p2  kc) are 2i  j  k + m(j  i)/2, m = 1, ..., 5. for the dual
space h 1(f kp2 ) we must take the negatives of these weights. so much for case 1a.

cases 1b and 2 the domain curves have two components (say, c1 and c2), so we
must understand what is meant, for example, by f t p2 and t c in order to calculate

the normal bundle. t c is locally free (like a vector bundle) everywhere except at the

singularity. there, we require tangent vectors to vanish. the canonical bundle, kc, is
dened as a line bundle of holomorphic dierentials, with the following construction at the

singularity. let f (w)dw be a dierential along c1, and let g(z)dz be a dierential along c2
where the singularity is taken to be (z = 0)  (w = 0). to dene a dierential along the

total space, we allow f and g to have up to simple poles at the origin, with the requirement

that the total residue vanish: reswf +reszg = 0. what this does is serve as an identication,
at the singularity, of the bers of the canonical bundles of the two components. in this

way, we arrive at a line bundle. this canonical bundle, when restricted to a component

ci, looks like kci(p), where the (p) indicates twisting by the point, i.e. allowing poles.
at this point, we can proceed with the calculation. consider case 2, for which the
map f is a bijection. the sections of h 1(f kp2 ) = h 0(f (kp2) can be looked at on each
component, where kc|ci is as above. hence on ci we have

1
w


z1




z2

 dw,

1


z1




z2

 dw,

w

z2

 dw.

on the the other component, we have three analogous sections, but two with poles need

to be identied, since they are related by the requirement of no total residue. indeed, this
identcation is compatible with equivariance, since 1
w dw has zero weight. all in all, we
have weights (recalling duality) j + k  2i, k  i, k  j, j  i, j  k.

the normal bundle to moduli space consists of sections of the pull-back of tangent
vectors on p2, less global tangent vectors on c. in addition, we include tpc1 tpc2, which
is a factor corresponding to a normal direction in which the node is resolved [6] . since the

maps from components are degree one for these cases, we can take as sections of the normal

bundles (two each) w, zw and z, wz. here we have identied the coordinate of the other
component with the coordinate of p2 normal to the component. the tpc1  tpc2 piece
gives w  z. in total, the weights are i  j, k  j, i  k, j  k, 2i  j  k.

20

one checks that the product of the numerator weights divided by the denominator

weights is equal to 1. since there are three graphs of this type, the total contribution to
k2 is 3. graphs whose image is a single xed p1 contribute 21/8,4 giving k2 = 45/8.
in physics, local mirror symmetry is all that is needed to describe the eective quan-

tum eld theory from compactication on a calabi-yau which contains a holomorphic

surface, if we take an appropriate limit (in which we turn o the dilaton). in this limit,

the global structure of the calabi-yau becomes irrelevant (hence the term local), and

we can learn about the eld theory by studying the local geometry of the surface  its

canonical bundle. we can therefore construct appropriate surfaces to study aspects of

four-dimensional gauge theories of our choosing [3] . the growth of the gromov-witten
invariants (or their local construction) in a specied degree over the base p1 is related to

the seiberg-witten coecient at that degree in the instanton expansion of the holomorphic

prepotential of the gauge theory. for example, the holomorphic vanishing cycles of an an
singularity bered over a p1 give su (n + 1) gauge theory (the mckay correspondence,

essentially), and one can construct a calabi-yau containing this geometry to check this [3]
[2]. in this case, the local surface is singular, as it is several intersecting p1s bered over
a p1 (for a1 we can take two hirzebruch surfaces intersecting in a common section. for
this reason, it is important to understand the case where the surface is singular, as well.

we will have more to say about this in section six.

4.2. general procedure for xed-point computations

following [6] and [10], we can compute the weights of our bundles explicitly. each

connected component of the xed point set is described by a graph, , which is a collection

of vertices, edges, and ags. the graph contains the data of the xed map, which includes
the image p1s, the degrees of the maps to the xed curves, and the way they are glued

together.

let us x some notation. to each connected component of f 1(p), where p is a xed
point of p, we have a vertex, v. we call cv = f 1(p) the pre-image of p, and if p = pj, we
say that i(v) = j (so i is a map from {vertices} to {1...n + 1}). let val(v) be the number

of special (marked or nodal) points on cv (for us equal to the number of edges with v as

4 because we are considering integrals in the sense of orbifolds, we must divide out the con-
tribution of each graph by the order of the automorphism group of the map. automorphisms are

maps  : c  c such that f   = f. cases 1a and 1b have z2 automorphism groups.

21

their vertex). the connected components of the pre-image of a xed line pij are denoted
ce. an edge consists of ce together with the data i(e), j(e)  {1, ..., n + 1} encoding the
image f (c) = pi(e),j(e), and de the degree of the map f |ce. if there is no confusion, we
will write i and j for i(e) and j(e). note that in the case of higher genus maps, the genus

g > 0 components of the domain curve must map to xed points

cv as there are no invariant curves of higher genus. in particular, the ce are all of
genus zero. we call a pair (v, e) where cv and ce intersect non-trivially a ag, f. for
f = (v, e), we dene i(f ) = i(v).

the xed point set corresponding to a graph  is then equal to a product over vertices

of the moduli space of genus g(v) curves with val(v) marked points: m =qv m g(v),val(v).

the calculation of the weights along the xed point sets follows from a simple, general

observation. given two varieties, y1 and y2, x = y1  y2 may be singular, but we can
construct the maps y1  y2
holomorphic functions:

 y1` y2  x, from which we construct maps of sheaves of



ox  oy1  oy2  oy1y2.

all maps are obtained from inclusions except the last map, which sends (f1, f2) to f1  f2,
so this sequence is exact.

for a graph with domain curve c which is equal to the union of all its components,

things are simple because there are at most pairwise non-trivial intersections, those being

points. thus we have the sequence

0  oc mv

ocv me

oce mf

oxf  0,

(4.1)

where xf = cv  ce if f = (v, e), and the second map sends (g|cv , h|ce) to g  h on the
point of intersection (if it exists).

we will use the long exact sequence associated to this short exact sequence in two

ways. the xed point formula tells us we need to compute the weights of our bundle ud
(whose bers are h 1(c, f kp2 )). when c is singular, we need to use the above sequence
twisted by (or tensored by) f kp2. then using concavity of the canonical bundle, which
states that f kp2 has no global sections on ce, the long exact sequence reads

0  h 0(c, f kp2 ) mv
 h 1(c, f kp2 ) mv

h 0(cv, f kp2 ) me
h 1(cv, f kp2 ) me

h 0(ce, f kp2 ) mf

h 1(ce, f kp2 )  0.

kp2 |f (xf ) 

(4.2)

22

the last term in the rst line follows since xf is a point, which is why the last term in the
second line is zero. note that f kp2

is trivial as a bundle on cv, since cv is mapped to a point. however, this trivial line
bundle has non-trivial weight equal to i  3i + i + j + k, where i = i(f ). this
will aect equivariant chern classes nontrivially. for example, h 0(cv, f kp2 ) is one-
dimensional (constant section) with the same weight  lets call it ci. h 1(cv, f kp2 ) is
thus equal to h 1(cv, o)  ci. also, since h 1(cv, o) are global holomorphic dierentials,
which may be integrated against cycles, we see that h 1(cv, o), as a bundle over the xed
point component m g(v),val(v) in moduli space, is equal to the dual e of the rank g(v)
hodge bundle, e. we are interested in cg(e  ci). the chern character (not class) is
well-behaved under tensor product, from which we can conclude [10]

cg(e  ci) = pg(i, e)

we know more about (4.2). h 1(ce, f kp2 ) can be computed exactly as in case 1a
from the previous section, giving weights i + m(i  )j), m = 1, ..., 3de  1. also,
h 0(ce, f kp2 ) = 0 by convexity, which tells us as well that h 0(c, f kp2 ) = 0 (obvious
if you think of the map). therefore the map to ags on the rst line of (4.2)is 1  1,

which is also obvious as it is restriction of constant sections (zero at a point i the section
is identically zero). thus the weights from the top line which map into h 1(c, f kp2)

are qf i(f )/qv i(v). noting that there are val(v) ags with v as their vertex, and

combining with the weights from the middle term on the second line of (4.2), we have

for the genus zero case, the polynomials involving the hodge bundle disappear.

if we twist the sequence (4.1) by f t p2 we can deduce the information we need to
compute h 0(c, f t p2)  h 1(c, f t p2), which is most of what is needed to compute the
virtual normal bundle to the xed point locus.5 however, a complete exposition for higher

5 when g 6= 0, the moduli space of maps is not smooth (convexity/concavity is no longer
valid), and one has to take care to dene integration of forms in the expected (top) dimension,
as the moduli space will contain components other dimensions. to do so, one must dene a cycle
of the expected dimension  the virtual fundamental class ([11] , [12] ).
[10] proved that with
these denitions, the atiyah-bott localization formulas continue to hold, with the normal bundle
replaced by an appropriately dened virtual normal bundle.

23

genus, where concavity or convexity is not enough to guarantee a smooth moduli space, is

beyond the scope of this paper, and we refer the reader to the discussion in section four of

[10] , with whose notation this paper is largely compatible. the genus zero case has been

worked out in full by [6] (see the formula at the end of section 3.3.4).

the upshot is that we can determine all the weights and classes of the bundles re-

stricted to the xed point loci systematically. after dividing numerator (chern class) by

denominator (euler class of normal bundle), one has polynomial class of degree equal to

the dimension of the xed locus. whats left is to integrate these classes over the moduli

spaces of curves (not maps) m g(v),val(v) at each vertex. these integrals obey famous re-
cursion relations [13], which entirely determine them. a program for doing just this has

been written by [14] . with this, and an algorithm for summing over graphs (with ap-

propriate symmetry factors), one can completely automate the calculation of higher genus

gromov-witten invariants. subtleties remain, however, regarding multicovers [15], [16],

[17] .

5. virtual classes and the excess intersection formula

one of the foundations of the theory of the moduli space of maps has been the con-

struction of the virtual class [12] [11] . a given space of maps m(, x) may be of the

wrong dimension, and the virtual class provides a way to correct for this. we consider

the correct dimension to be one imposed either by physical theory, or by the require-

ment that the essential behavior of the moduli space be invariant under deformations of

x (this may include topological deformations of x, or just deformations of symplectic or

almost complex structures). the virtual class is a class in the cohomology (or chow) ring

of m(, x); its principal properties are that it is a class in the cohomology ring of the

expected dimension, and that numbers calculated by integrating over the virtual class are

invariant under deformations of x. see [12] [11] for more exact and accurate statements.

one main theme of this paper is to use the invariance under deformation to either calculate

these numbers, or to explain the signicance of a calculation.

the idea of a cohomology class (or cohomology calculation) which corrects for im-

proper behavior has been around for a long time in intersection theory. one example is

the excess intersection formula. if we attempt to intersect various classes in a cohomology

ring, and if we choose representatives of those classes which fail to intersect transversely,

24

the resulting dimension of the intersection may be too large. the excess intersection for-

mula allows us to perform a further calculation on this locus to determine the actual class

of the intersection. the purpose of this section is to describe the excess intersection for-

mula for degeneracy loci of vector bundles, and to use this formula to evaluate or explain

some mirror symmetry computations. in the cases we examine, the moduli space of maps

to our space x can be given as the degeneracy locus of a vector bundle on a larger space

of maps. in each case that these degeneracy loci are of dimension larger than expected,

the virtual class will turn out to be the same as the construction given by the excess in-

tersection formula. the virtual class and the excess intersection formula are both aspects

of the single idea mentioned above, and have as common element in their construction the

notion of the rened intersection class [18].

to a vector bundle e of rank r on a smooth algebraic variety x of dimension n, we

associate the chern classes, cj (e), j = 0, . . . , r, and also the total chern class c(e) =
1 + c1(e) + c2(e) +    + cr(e). these classes are elements of the cohomology ring of x.
the class cj(e) represents a class of codimension j in x, and in particular the class cn(e)
is a class in codimension n, and can be associated with a number. for any class  in the

ring, the symbol rx  means to throw away all parts of  except those parts in degree n,

and evaluate the number associated to those parts.

for a vector bundle e whose rank is greater or equal to the dimension n of x, we are

often interested in calculating the number associated to cn(e), or in the previous notation,

rx c(e). one way to compute chern classes is to realize them as degeneracy loci of linear

combinations of sections. if e is of rank r  n, and we take r n+1 generic global sections

1, . . . , rn+1, the locus of points where 1, . . . , rn+1 fail to be linearly independent
represents the class cn(e). often this way of interpreting the chern classes is the one
which has the most geometric meaning. the statement generic above means that if we

carry out this procedure and nd out that the degeneracy locus is of the correct dimension

(that is: points), then the sections were generic enough.

sometimes the sections we can get our hands on to try and calculate rx c(e) with

are not generic in this sense, and the degeneracy locus consists of some components which

are positive dimensional.

in this situation, the excess intersection formula tells us how

to associate to each positive dimensional conected component of the degeneracy locus a

number, called the excess intersection contribution. this number is the number of points

which the component morally accounts for. part of the excess intersection theorem is

the assertion that the sum of the excess intersection contributions over all the connected

25

components of the degeneracy locus, and the sum of the remaining isolated points add

up to rx c(e). this corresponds to the invariance of numbers computed using the virtual

class under deformations of the target manifold.

let y be one of the connected components described above. lets assume for simplicity

that y is actually a submanifold of m . in this situation the excess intersection formula

says that the excess intersection contribution of y is

c(e)

c(ny /m )

.

zy

(5.1)

here ny /m is the normal bundle of y in m , and the expression after the integral sign
makes sense, since c(ny /m ) is an element of a graded ring whose degree zero part is 1, and
so c(ny /m ) may be inverted in that ring.

5.1. rational curves on the quintic threefold

as an example of an application of the excess intersection formula to explain the

signicance of a calculation, let us review the count of the rational curves on a quintic
threefold as explained by kontsevich [6] . let md = m00(d, p4) be the moduli space of
maps of genus zero curves of degree d to p4. md is of dimension 5d+1. let ud be the vector
bundle on md whose bre at any stable map (c, f ) is h 0(c, f op4 (5)); this is a bundle of
c(ud) have been computed by mirror symmetry, and

the rst few are k1 = 2875, k2 = 4876875/8, and k3 = 8564575000/27. to try and nd

rank 5d + 1. the numbers kd =rmd
a geometric interpretation of these numbers, we compute rmd

section of ud and examining its degeneracy locus. let f be a generic section of op4 (5)
on p4 which cuts out a smooth quintic threefold x. we pull f back to give us a global

c(ud) by nding a global

section of ud, which we call d. the degeneracy locus of d in md consists of those maps

(c, f ) with f (c) contained in this quintic threefold. this observation allows us to use the

kd to compute the number of rational curves of degree d on the quintic threefold x.

in degree 1 the degeneracy locus consists of one point for every line mapping into x,

and so we see that k1 = 2875 is the number of lines in a quintic threefold. in degree two,

the degeneracy locus of 2 consists of an isolated point for every degree two rational curve

in x, and 2875 positive dimensional loci, each one consisting of maps which map two to

one onto a line in x. to calculate the actual number of degree two rational curves in

x, we compute the excess intersection contribution of each of these positive dimensional

26

components, and subtract from the previously computed total of 4876875/8. we now

compute this excess intersection contribution.

for each line l in x, let yl be the submanifold of m2 parameterizing two to one covers
of l. the normal bundle of l in p4 is nl/p4 = ol(1)  ol(1)  ol(1). a calculation on the
tangent space of m2 shows that the normal bundle nyl/m2 is (at a map (c, f )) equal to
h 0(c, f nl/p4 ).

since the line l is sitting in the quintic threefold x, its normal bundle maps naturally
to the normal bundle of x in p4, with kernel the normal bundle of l in x. this gives us

an exact sequence:

0  ol(1)  ol(1)  nl/p4  ol(5)  0.

let v2 be the bundle on yl whose bre at a map (c, f ) is h 1(c, f ol(1)). the

above short exact sequence on l gives us the sequence

0  nyl/m2  e2  v2  v2  0

of bundles on m2. the multiplicative properties of chern classes in short exact sequences
shows us that the excess contribution of yl is:

zyl

c(e2)

c(nyl/m2)

=zyl

c(v2)c(v2).

this last number is the aspinwall-morrison computation of 1/d3, or in this case,

1/8. this gives the number of actual degree two rational curves on a quintic threefold as

4876875/8  2875/8 = 609250

under the assumption that each rational curve in x is isolated and smooth, then

similar computations give the famous formula [19]

nd/k
k3 ,

kd =xk|d

(5.2)

where nd is the number of rational curves in degree d. a caveat: it has been shown
that this assumption is false in at least one instance  in degree ve, some of the rational

curves are plane curves with six nodes [20]. this doesnt aect the computation until you
try to calculate multiple cover contributions from these curves. for example,6 in degree

6 we thank n. c. leung for describing this example to us.

27

ten we have double covers of these nodal curves. the moduli space of double covers of

a (once) nodal rational curve has two components: one being degree two maps to the

normalization of the nodal curve, which contributes 1/8 as for the smooth case; the other

being a single point representing two diconnected copies of the normalization mapping

down to the singular curve. if p, q represent the points on the normalization which are

to be identied for the nodal curve, there is a uniqe map from a domain curve with two

components and one node, where the node is mapped to p on one copy and q on the other

(these points are identied). this double cover does not factor through the normalization.

if we have n such curves, their double covers contribute n/8 + n. the integers nd obtained
from the formula (5.2) need to be shifted to have the proper enumerative interpretation

(experimentally, this shift is integral, though this has not been proven [21] ).

5.2. calabi-yau threefolds containing an algebraic surface

let us consider the situation where we have a calabi-yau threefold, x, in a toric

variety, p, and a smooth algebraic surface, b, contained within x :

b  x  p.

(5.3)

we assume as well that b is a fano surface so that x may be deformed so that b shrinks

[22]. this is the scenario of interest to us in this paper. now since there are holomorphic

maps of many degrees into b, which therefore all lie within x, we will have an enormous

if x is cut from some section s, then at degree  the whole space
degeneracy locus.
m0,0(; b) will be a zero set of the pull-back section s.7 therefore, we will need to use
the excess intersection formula to calculate the contribution of the surface to the gromov-

witten invariants for x. from this, we will extract integers which account for the eective

number of curves due to b.

mapping tangent vectors, we have from (5.3) the following exact sequence: 0 
nb/x  nb/p  nx/p  0. note that nb/x = kb, by triviality of 3t x and the
exact sequence t b  t x  nb/x . therefore, we have

0  kb  nb/p  nx/p  0.

7 actually,  labels a class in x which may be the image of a number of classes in b. in such a
case, our invariants are only sensitive to the image class, and represent a sum of invariants indexed

by classes in b.

28

given (c, f )  m0,0(; b), we can pull back these bundles and form the long exact

sequence of cohomlogy:

0  h 0(c, f kb)  h 0(c, f nb/p)  h 0(c, f nx/p) 

 h 1(c, f kb)  h 1(c, f nb/p)  ...

.

(5.4)

now h 0(c, f kb) = 0 since b is fano (its canonical bundle is negative), and
h 1(c, f nb/p) = 0 when b is cut out as a complete intersection of zeroes of sections.
the reason for this is that a line bundle l with section s on a toric variety is positive, as

the section denes a divisor d with c  d = rc c1(l  0 if they intersect generically (if

not, we can use the torus action to move c so that it does). as a result, (5.4) becomes

a short exact sequence of the bundles over m0,0(; b)  m0,0(; p) whose bers are
the corresponding cohomlogy groups. the bundle (call it u) with ber h 1(c, f kb) is
the one we use to dene the local invariants. the bundle with ber h 0(c, f nb/p) is
nm(b)/m(p) (abbreviating the notation a bit). that with ber h 0(c, f nx/p) is the one
used to dene the (global) gromov-witten invariants for x  call it e. therefore, we

have

0  u  nm(b)/m(p)  e  0.

now using (5.1) with e = e; m = m0,0(; p); and y = m0,0(; b); the multi-

plicativity of the chern class gives the contribution to the gromov-witten invariant of the

threefold x from a surface b  x is

k =zm0,0(;b)

c(u),

(5.5)

which is what we have been computing.

typically, the presence of a surface b  x may not be generic, so that x can

be deformed to a threefold x  not containing such a holomorphic surface. let k x
 be
the gromov-witten invariant of x, and let k x
 be the gromow-witten of x . these
are equal, as the gromov-witten invariant is an intersection independent of deformation:
k x
, the
numbers of rational curves on x . let n be the numbers of rational curves on x, and let
k be the integral in (5.5). for simplicity, let us assume that dimh2(x ) = 1, so that

kd =xk|d

here n = n  n represents the eective number of curves coming from b. in the text, we

typically write n for n.

we therefore have an enumerative interpretation of the local invariants. after per-
foming the 1/d3 reduction we get an integer representing an eective number of curves

(modulo multiple covers of singular curves, which should shift these integers). we should

note that one might ask about rational curves in the calabi-yau which intersect our fano

surface. such a situation would make for a more complicated degeneracy locus, but it
turns out this situation does not arise. indeed, if c  x is a holomorphic curve in x
meeting b transversely, then c  b > 0 (strictly greater). however, for c  b, we have

c  b =zd

c1(nb/x ) =zd

c1(kb) < 0,

by the fano condition. therefore, c cannot lie in the image of h2(b) in h2(x)  the
only classes in which we are interested  and so our understanding of the numbers nd is
therefore complete.

5.3. singular geometries

for physical applications, we will often want the surface b to be singular. for ex-

ample, in order to geometrically engineer su (n + 1) supersymmetric gauge theories in
four dimensions, we consider the local geometry of an an singularity bered over a p1.
in fact, we take a resolution along each an ber, so that the exceptional divisor over a
point is a set of p1s intersecting according to the dynkin diagram of su (n + 1). the
total geometry of these exceptional divisors forms a singular surface, which is a set of p1
bundles over p1 (hirzebruch surfaces) intersecting along sections. in [3] it is shown how

the local invariants we calculate can be used to derive the instanton contributions to the
gauge couplings. roughly speaking, the number of wrappings of the p1 base determines

30

the instanton number, while the growth with ber degree of the number of curves with a

xed wrapping along the base determines the corresponding invariant.

it is clearly of interest, then, to be able to handle singular geometries. actually, we

will be able to do so without too much eort. let us consider an illustrative example.
dene the singular surface b to be two p2s intersecting in a p1. this can be thought of

as a singular quadric surface, since it can be represented as the zero locus of the reducible

degree two polynomial

xy = 0

in p3 with homogeneous coordinates [x, y, z]. the generic smooth quadric is a surface b =
p1p1. if we express b as a hypersurface in p3, we can dene the local invariants (indexed
only by the generator of h2(p3)) of b as an intersection calculation in m0,0(d; p3) as
follows. dene the bundle

e  op3 (2)  op3 (2).

then let se = (s, 0) be a global section of e, where s is a quadric and 0 is the only
global section of op3 (2). note that, by design, e restricted to the zero set of se is
equal to kb. we now dene a bundle over m0,0(d; p3) whose bers over a point (c, f )
are h 0(c, f op3 (2))  h 1(c, f op3 (2)). we then compute the top chern class of the

bundle, which can be calculated as in the previous subsections in terms of the zero locus of
se, which picks out maps into b = p1  p1. the calculation gives the usual local invariant
for p1  p1, counting curves by their total degree d = d1 + d2, where di is the degree in
p1
i , i = 1, 2. the reason is that o(2)|b = nb/p3 , so the contribution from this part to the

total chern class cancels with the normal bundle to the map.

now note that this intersection calculation is independent of the section we use to
compute it. in fact, if we use a reducible quadric whose zero locus is b, the calculation
will reduce to one on the singular space m0,0(d; b). the excess intersection formula tells
us exactly which class to integrate over this (singular) space. in fact, integration over the

singular space is only dened via the virtual fundamental class  which is constructed to

yield the same answer. in degree one, this can all be checked explicitly in this example
[23] the upshot is that as our calculations are independent of deformations, we can deform
our singular geometries to do local calulations in a simpler setting. in fact, this makes

intuitive physical sense: the a-model should be independent of deformations.

another phenomenon that we note in examples is that the calculation of the mirror

principle can be performed without reference to a specic bundle.

in other words, the

31

toric data dening any non-compact calabi-yau threefold works as input data. as a

result, we can consider calabi-yau threefolds containing singular divisors and perform the

calculation. for the example of a2 bered over a sphere, we get the numbers in table

4. though this technique has not yet been proven to work, it is tantalizing to guess that

the whole machinery makes sense for any non-compact threefold, with intersections taking

place in the chow ring and with an appropriately dened prepotential.

in the next section, we will use the b-model to dene dierential equations whose

solutions determine the local contributions we have been discussing.

6. local mirror symmetry: the b-model

in this section we describe the mirror symmetry calculation of the gromov-witten

invariants for a (n  1)-dimensional manifold b with c1(b) > 0. we rst approach this
by using mirror symmetry for a compact, elliptically bered calabi-yau n-fold9 x which

contains b as a section, and taking then the volume of the ber to innity. if b is a fano

manifold or comes from a (n  1)-dimensional reexive polyhedron a smooth weierstrass
calabi-yau x with b as a section exists. moreover the geometry of x depends only on b
and therefore the limit can be described intrinsically from the geometry of b. this is an

intermediate step. later, we will dene the objects relevant for the b-model calculation

for b intrinsically, without referring to any embedding. such an embedding, in fact, is in

general not possible.

6.1. periods and dierential equations for global mirror symmetry

we briey review the global case in the framework of toric geometry, following the
ideas and notations of [24][25]. according to [24], a mirror pair (x, x) with the property
hp,q(x) = hnp,q( x) can be represented as the zero locus of the newton polynomials10
(p = 0, p = 0) associated to a dual pair of reexive (n + 1)-dimensional polyhedra (, ).

the sum (6.1) runs over r relevant points {(i)}  , which do not lie on codimension

complex structure deformations of x redundantly because of the induced (c)n+2 actions

on the ai, which compensate xi  ixi, p  0p, such that p = 0 is invariant. invariant

which correspond to a complete regular triangulation of  [28], then l(j) span the dual
cone (mori cone) to the kahler cone of p( ), which is always contained in a kahler cone
of x and zi = 0 corresponds to a point of maximal unipotent monodromy, which by the
mirror map [19][25] corresponds to the large kahler structure limit of x.

the period integrals of x contain the information about the gromov-witten invariants
of x (and vice versa). they are dened as integrals of the unique holomorphic (n, 0)-form
over the bn (= 2(h2,1(x) + 1) when n = 3) cycles i in the middle cohomology of x. the
(n, 0)-form is given by a generalization of griths residue expressions [29]

where we factored from the rst operator a degree four dierential operator. this is

equivalent to discarding four solutions which have incompatible behavior at the boundary

of the moduli space to be periods, while the remaining (2h2,1(x) + 2) solutions can be
indentied with period integrals for x.

note that in general at the point of maximal unipotent monodromy [19][30][25][31]

zi = 0, 0 = 1 + o(z) is the only holomorphic solution to the picard-fuchs system. let
us now12 set n = 3. in general, there will be h2,1(x) logarithmic solutions of the form

denes ane complex structure parameters of x, which at zi = 0 can be identied with the
complexied kahler parameters ti = iv ol(ci) + b(ci) of x, following [19]. the relation
(6.9) is called the mirror map and in particular, in the limit v ol(ci)   one has

log(zi)  v ol(ci).

(6.10)

h2,1 further solutions are quadratic, and one is cubic in the logarithm. these solutions
are related to each other and to the quantum corrected triple intersection ci,j,k by spe-

cial geometry, basically grith transversality13 r (i)   = r (ij)   = 0. as

12 some aspects for the case of arbitary n are discusses in [32][33][34].
13 if n is even we get in general algebraic relations between the solutions and dierential rela-
tions. the algebraic relations in the k3 case are wellknown, in the 3-fold case we have special

geometry, for 4-folds the algebraic and dierential relations can be found explicitly in [34].

6.2. the limit of large elliptic ber

we now identify the classes of the curves ci and dene the limit of large ber volume.
then we will use (6.9) to translate that into a limit in the complex structure deforma-
tions parameters zi of x. note that in batyrevs construction the points (i)  rel()
correspond to monomials in p as well as to divisors di
in p() (in the example,
p() = p(1, 1, 1, 6, 9)) which intersect x. each l(i) denes a wall in the kahler cone
of x at which curves in the class [ci] vanish. moreover, the entries l(j)
, i = 1, . . . , r are
the intersection of these curves cj with the restriction di of the divisors di, i = 1, . . . , r
to x. from this information one can identify the classes [ci] in x. it is convenient to use
the cox coordinate ring representation [35] p() = {c[x1, . . . xr] \ sri}/(c)k, where
the c-actions are given by xi  xi((j))l(j)
and sri denotes the stanley reisner ideal.
in these coordinates di is simply given by xi = 0 and the polynomial reads

d4 meets x in a p2, the section of the weierstrass form. as [c2]  d4 = 3, c2 must be

36

contained in this p2, and from c2  di = 1, i = 1, 2, 3, it follows that c2 lies in that p2
with degree14 1. [c1]  d4 = 1, hence c1 meets the section once and must be a curve in the
bre direction, whose volume goes to innity in the large bre limit. by this association

still compact support. from (6.11),(6.12), and (6.7), part f, we see that the nite solutions

are 0, 0t2 and 0(1  32)f . moreover, as they do not contain log(z1) terms they
satisfy in this limit (and are in fact determined by) the specialization of (6.8) as z1  0 :

l = 3 + 3z(3 + 2)(3 + 1),

(6.15)

where we have put z  z2 and   2.

this dierential equation comes from the relation of the points in the two dimensional

face b = conv{1, . . . , 4} in . we call the newton polynomial for this set of points pb.

6.3. local mirror symmetry for the canonical line bundle of a torically described surface

we will generalize the example of the previous section to the situation where one has as

smooth weierstrass form for the threefold over some base b. the known list of bases which

14 as a consistency check, note that j2 which is the dual divisor to c2 must then have a
component in the base p 2 and one in the bre direction, hence on dimensional grounds it can at
most intersect quadratically comp (6.7), part f.

37

lead to smooth weierstrass forms are fano varieties and torically descibed bases whose fans

are constructed from the polyhedra b, which we display in gure 1. for these bases, we

can demonstrate the property of admitting a smooth weierstrass form by explicitly showing
that total space constructed from f ibration = conv{(b
i , e), (0, 0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1)} is
smooth. here b
i runs over the 2-tuple of the coordinates of points in b and for ek one
has the choice (2, 3), (1, 2), and (1, 1) for the e8, e7, e6 respective ber types described

below.

for the smooth brations, all topological data of x are expressible from the base
topology and we hape a surjective map i : h 1,1(x)  h 1,1(b). using the adjunction
formula15 one nds (here we understand that on the left side we integrate over x and on

the right side over b)

here je is a cohomology element supported on the elliptic bre; its dual homology element

is the base. the ji are cohomology elements supported on curves in b, with homology

duals curves in b together with their bers. k is the number of sections for the various

weierstrass forms, i.e. 1 for the e8 form x6(1, 2, 3), 2 for the e7 form x4(1, 1, 2), 3 for the

e6 form x3(1, 1, 1) and 4 for the d5 form x2,2(1, 1, 1, 1); h is the dual coxeter number

associated with the groups: h = 30, 18, 12, 8, respectively.

from (6.11) and (6.12) we get that (were c1 = c1(b))

te f = t2

ti f = t2

ec2

1 + texi
e(c1ji) + texj

ti(c1ji) + titj(jjji) + o(q)

and hence the unique nite combination in the te  i limit is given by

f in = (te xi

xiti)f , with xi

xi(jijj) = c1jj

(6.17)

15 this calculation arises in the f-theory context [36].

38

potential for the metric gi,j,. for the polyhedra 2  14 im(gi,j) becomes in a suitable limit

the exact gauge coupling for an n = 2 theory in 4 dimensions (seiberg-witten theory)

[3]. furthermore, all intersections in (6.18) are intersections in the two-dimensional base

manifold and in this sense we have achieved the goal of formulating the mirror symmetry

conjecture intrinsically from the geometric data of the base. it remains to construct a local

picard-fuchs system which has flocal =ph1,1(b)

unique solution quadratic in the logarithms.

the non-compact local geometry t(b ) is the canonical bundle over pb .

it is

described by the incomplete fan (b), which is spanned in three dimensions (n = 3) by
extended vectors (i) = (1, (i)), with (i)  b generate the lattice.

the local mirror geometry is in these cases given by an elliptic curve which is dened
in coordinates as (6.13), w.r.t. to (b, b) and a meromorphic two-form  with non-
vanishing residue. the number of independent cycles increases for the polyhedra 1  15

with the number of nonvanishing residue, which in physics play the role of scale or mass

39

parameters. this is in contrast to the situation in the next section, where the genus of the

riemann surface will increase and with it the number of double logarithmic solutions.

in particular, for the example dicussed before we get from (6.13) that the mirror

geometry is the elliptic curve given by the standard cubic in p2

pb = a1x3

1 + a1x3

2 + a3x3

3 + a0x1x2x3.

an important intermediate step in the derivation of this form [24], which be useful later,

is that the polynomial can also be represented by coordinates yi,

pb = a1y1 + a1y2 + a3y3 + a0y0 ,

(6.21)

in particular 0 = 1 is always a solution. by the same procedure as indicated below

(6.6), we now directly get the dierential equation (6.15). one can easily show that

this dierential equation has besides the constant solution a logarithmic and a double-

logarithmic solution. the explicit form of the solutions can be given in general using the

l(i), i = 1, . . . m in specialized versions of the formulas which appeared in [25]:

16 in the cases we do not treat explicitly, the mori cone is non-simplicial. this means that
there are several coordinate choices for the large complex structure variables, which correspond

to the simplical cones in a simplicial decomposition of the mori cone. this is merely a technical

complication. we checked that for the simplicial subcones we get an instanton expansion from

(6.18).

here we use the short-hand notation r =p jijkrb jijk and c1 =pi jir c1(b)ji. below

in general, linear combinations of the l(i) may lead to to independent dierential operators.

for example, a complete system for the blown up f2 (polyhedron 6) is obtained using in

addition to the l(i), i = 1, 2, 3, the linear relations l(2) + l(3) and l(1) + l(3) :

l1 = 2(2  3 + 1)  (2 + 22  3)(1 + 22  3)z1,

l2 = (22  3)(3  1)  (1 + 2  3 + 1)(1 + 3 + 1)z2,

l3 = (2 + 3  1)1  (1 + 3  1)(1 + 3 + 1)z3,

l4 = 2(3  1)  (1 + 22  3)(1 + 3 + 1)z1z2,

l5 = ((22  3)1)  (2 + 3 + 1)(1 + 3 + 1)z2z3.

using similar arguments as in section four of the second reference in [25] and the

calculation of toric intersections as described in [37],[38],[39], one can show that (6.21) and

(6.22) implies the appearance of the intersection numbers in (6.18).

concrete instanton numbers for p2 appear in table 1; for f0, f1 and f2 in the

appendix; and for the polyhedra p5 and p6 in table 3 below.

6.4. fibered an cases and more general toric grid diagrams

the bered an geometry is motivated from physics [3]. it arrises when inside a calabi-
yau space an an sphere tree is bred over an p1. again we consider the limit that all

other kahler parameters of the threefold which do not control the sizes of the mentioned

p1s become large. in this case (6.18) becomes the exact gauge coupling of su (n + 1)

n = 2 seiberg witten theory when one takes a double-scaling limit in which the size of

the ber p1 and the one of base p1 are taken small in a ratio described in [3]. we have

already discussed the simplest cases the hirzebruch surfaces f2, f0 and f1, which give rise

to a1 theory. next we consider the an generalization of the f2 case. we can describe it by

43

t(b ) as before (below (6.19)), but it clearly does not have the structure of a canonical
bundle over a space.

to obtain the local situation as a limit of a compact case, we can consider a polyhe-
dron  dened analogous to f ibration described at the beginning of subsection 6.3. it
turns out that for a2 (a3)  becomes reexive only after adding the point(s) [1, 0, 1, 1]
([1, 0, 0, 1], [2, 0, 1, 2]), giving us 2 (3) line bundles normal to the to the compact part of

the local geometry. this is true more generally, i.e. one has n line bundles for an, but
for large n it is not possible to embed the an singularity in a compact calabi-yau. the
n normal directions in the kahler moduli space mean that the limit (6.17) leads to an

n-dimensional linear space of nite double-logarithmic solutions whose coecients reect

the directions in the normal kahler moduli space in which the limit can be taken and for

combinatorial reasons their number corresponds to the number of inner points in the toric

diagram. we denote a basis for these directions si, i = 1, . . . , n. the n double-logarithmic
solutions come as we will see, given the meromorphic dierential (6.19), from a genus n

riemann surface for the local mirror. the gromov-witten invariants, on the other hand,

should not depend on the direction of the limit we take to obtain f in before matching
it to the n ~d in (6.18). they therefore become rather non-trivial invariants of the dier-
ential system (6.21). in the following, we explicitly describe for all n the solutions of this

system corresponding to a preferred period basis, up to a choice of the double-logarithmic

solutions.

the generators of linear relations are

l(b) = (1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, . . . , 0, 0, 0, 0),

l(1) = (0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0, 0, 0, 0),

this can be indentied, upon going to an ane patch s = 1 after trivial redenitions and

the [3] limit, with the genus n su (n + 1) curves for n = 2 super-yang-mills theory [40].

to obtain the complete solutions of the period system to the local mirror geometry

(6.24), we have to specify the classical intersection terms in the n double-logarithmic
solutions si f . using (6.23),(6.21), the relation between the ideal of the principal part
of the dierential operator at the maximal unipotent point zi = 0 and the logarithmic
solutions of gkz-systems as in section 4 of [25], as well as some algebra, we arrive at the
following structure of the general double-logarithmic solution for arbitrary n (ji  log(zi)):

n

r =

yiji(jb +

2kjk).

(6.25)

xi=1

xk=1

here the coecients of the yi can be viewed as logarithmic terms of sif . this leads by
(6.22) to an explicit basis of solutions.

it remains to x the xi by requiring invariance of the n ~d in (6.18) given the general

solution (6.25), which yields

xi = mi,jyj, i, j = 1, . . . , n ,

(6.26)

where m is the cartan matrix of an. using this description, we can calculate the instantons
for all an.

table 6: gromov-witten invariants for the phase a in fig. 3

from the examples treated so far it should be clear how to proceed for a general toric

grid diagram with n inner points and m boundary points. after choosing a triangulation
and a corresponding basis of the m + n  3 linear relations l(i) one analyses the principal

part of the dierential system (6.21) to obtain a basis of the double-logarithmic solutions.

this is the only additional information needed to specify the full set of the 2n + m  2

solutions from (6.22). the general structure of the solutions will be as follows. besides

the constant solution, we get for each of the n inner points of the toric diagram, whose

total number equals the genus of the riemann surface, one-single logarithmic solution and

one double-logarithmic solution coming from the period integrals around a- and b-type

cycles of the riemann surface. from additional boundary points in the toric grid diagram

beyond 3 we get additional single-logarithmic solutions which correpond to residues of the

meromorphic form (6.19). together with (6.9) the solutions determine (6.18) and hence

the gromov-witten invariants, up to a choice of xi and yi, which represents a choice of
the bases for the double-logarithmic solutions. requiring the gromov-witten invariants

to be independent of this choice gives a linear relation xi(yj). this produces the vacuum
solutions for all ve dimensional theories, as discussed in [41], which come from arbitrary

grid diagrams [42].

6.5. cases with constraints

the del pezzo surfaces bn can be constructed by blowing p2 up n times, 0  n  8, in
addition to p1  p1. as is well known, the case n = 6 can be represented as a cubic in p3

denoted by x3(1, 1, 1, 1), and n = 7, 8 are representable as degree four and six hypersurfaces

in weighted projective spaces: x4(1, 1, 1, 2) and x6(1, 1, 2, 3), respectively. the n = 5 case
can be represented as the degree (2,2) complete intersection in p4 x2,2(1, 1, 1, 1, 1). in
addition, the quadric in p3, x2(1, 1, 1, 1) is another representation of p1  p1.

in the

representation given for the non-local calabi-yau as the canonical bundle over this del

pezzo surfaces below, the map i : h 1,1(x)  h 1,1(b) is not onto, as in the previous

cases. as a consequence the gromow-witten invariants are a sum over curves with degree

di in classes in h 1,1(b) up to degree d =pi di. these cases have been considered before

[2][43][44][5].

as all the weights in these representations are co-prime, the kahler class associated

to the hyperplane class of the ambient space is the only one which restricts to the surface

(no exceptional divisors from the ambient space). we can recast the chern classes of the

surface and the of the canonical bundle over it in terms of this class j. this can be stated

more generally for smooth complete intersections by the denition of the following formal

weight or charge vectors (d1(k), . . . , dr(k)|w1(k), . . . , ws(k)), where di(k) are the degree of

the ith polynomial, i = 1, . . . , p, in the variables of the kth weighted projective space,

k = 1, . . . , s. in terms of these we can express the total chern class, by the adjunction

formula, to obtain the following formal expansion

i=1 (1 + wi,(k)j(k))

k=1qr(k)
c = qs
qp
i=1(1 +ps

k=1 di,(k)j(k)) qp
i=1ps
k=1qr(k)
qs
k=1qr
with the volume form of the normal bundle v = qt
coecient of qt

integrals over the top class for the non-compact case are formally denined by multiplying
j=1 dj,(k)j (k) and picking the
k=1 j s(k)1. similarly wegde products of c2 with j and triple intersections
are obtained.17 we start by summarizing the weight or charge vectors for the non-compact

k=1 dj,(k)j (k)

i=1 wi,(k)

.

(6.27)

17 there are minor disagreements with the classical integrals equation (4.18) in [43] as well as

with the normalization of the instanton numbers for the case referred to as conifold in [43].

these data should all follow from (6.27).

7. discussion

we have established that mirror symmetry makes good sense in the local setting,

with the enumerative invariants counting the eective contribution of the surface to the

gromov-witten invariants of a would-be calabi-yau threefold which contains it. these

invariants, dened and computed mathematically, are obtained through analyzing solutions

to dierential equations, as in the global case. as in previous works, we see the seiberg-

witten curve arising from the b-model approach, if an n=2 gauge theory is geometrically

engineered.

several interesting observations were made along the way. we found, analyzing a

reducible quadric, that singular surfaces pose no obstacle to dening the local invariants.

indeed the a-model should be independent of deformations; equivalently, calculations of

chern classes by sections are independent of the choice of section. further, rather as the

canonical bundle description breaks down for singular surfaces, we nd in the bered an
examples (in which the bered sphere-trees represent the singular surface) that the bundle

structure does not appear to be necessary to proceed with the calculation. heuristically,

one can model not just the moduli space of maps as a projective variety, but in fact the

whole vector bundle ud. with intersections in the chow ring and integration well-dened

51

by virtue of a thom class, the procedure seems to yield the correct results. this technique

needs to be developed and made rigorous, but the numbers still agree with the b-model

results in table 4-5.

the recent work of vafa and gopakumar [17] introduces a new interpretation of these

numbers and their analogues at higher genus.

in particular, those authors count the

contributions of bps states (d-branes) in a xed homology class (but not xed genus)

to the full string partition function, which is a sum over topological partition functions

at all genera. their calculations tell us how to organize the partition functions in order

to extract integers, which represent bps states corresponding to cohomology classes on
the full moduli space of bps states18 and transforming under a certain su (2) action in a

particular way. in genus zero, the contribution is equivalent to the euler characteristic. at
degree three in p2, for example, a smooth degree three polynomial is an elliptic curve, and

the d-brane moduli space includes the choice of a u (1) bundle over the curve, equivalently

a point on the curve (if it is smooth). the choice of curves with points is shown in [17] to
be a p8 bundle over p2, a space with euler characeristic 27 (which is indeed n3 for p2).
the singular curves, however, should be accompanied by their compactied jacobians as

in [45], but these can in general no longer be equated with the curves themselves. further,
the compactied jacobians of reducible curves (e.g., the cubic xy z = 0 in p2) are

particularly troublesome. perhaps the non-compact direction in kp2 leads to a resolution

of these diculties. it would be very interesting to mesh the gromov-witten and d-brane

explanations of these local invariants.

having extended traditional mirror symmetry to the non-compact case, one naturally

asks whether other viewpoints of mirror symmetry make sense in the non-compact setting.

is there any kind of special-lagrangian bration? it is likely that, if so, the bers would
be decompactied tori, e.g. s1  s1  r. 19 this would be an interesting venue to the

conjectures of [47]. in particular, once the kahler-einstein metric of the surface is known,

calabi [48] has given a method to nd a ricci-at metric on the total space of the canonical

bundle. in [47] it is argued that not only should the total d-brane moduli space of the

special-lagrangian torus be the mirror manifold, but also that the metric of the mirror

should be computable by an instanton expansion involving holomorphic discs bounding

the torus. the local setting of a degenerate ber, such as has been studied and given an

18 this is the standard reduction to a supersymmetric sigma model on a moduli space.
19 recently, [46] has found such a bration for canonical bundles of projective spaces.

52

explicit metric in [49], may prove an illustrative starting point (though several of us have

been unable to crack this example).

what about the categorical mirror symmetry conjecture of kontsevich? unfortu-

nately, few explicit descriptions are known of the derived categories of coherent sheaves

over non-compact spaces (or any spaces, for that matter). in two dimensions, however, the

recent work of [50] gives a description of the derived category over resolutions of a-d-e sin-

gularities in two dimensions. the bered versions of these spaces are just what we consider

in this paper. it would be extremely interesting to calculate fukayas category in these

examples, especially as we currently have a real dearth testing grounds for kontsevichs

ideas.

we feel that the local setting may be the best place for gleaning whats really at work

in mirror symmetry and tying together our still fragmented understanding of this subject.

8. appendix: examples (a-model)

8.1. o(4)  p3

this case is very similar, only we note that the rank of ud is 4d + 1 and the dimension

of moduli space is 4d. thus we must take the chern class c4d integrated over the moduli

space. taking the next-to-top chern class has the following interpretation. instead of just

counting the zeros of a section, s0, we take two sections s0 and s1 and look at the zeros of

s0  s1, i.e. we look for points where the two sections are not linearly independent. the
number of such points also has the following interpretation. look at the p1 linear system

generated by s0 and s1. if s0  s1 has a zero at a point (c, f ) in moduli space, then some

section as0 +bs1 vanishes identically on f (c), i.e. f (c) maps to the zero locus of as0 +bs1.

53

therefore, the interpretation of the next-to-top chern class is as the number of rational

curves in any member of the linear system generated by two linearly independent sections.

of course, in this problem, we must account for multiple covers as above. after doing

so, the numbers nd which we get are as follows:

table 8: gromov-witten invariants for a k3 surface inside a calabi-yau threefold.

practically speaking, sections are simply quartic polynomials, and the zero loci are

quartic k3 surfaces. therefore, we are counting the number of rational curves in a pencil

of quartic k3 surfaces. we may wish to compare our results with a calabi-yau manifold

admitting a k3 bration. of course, the number of curves will depend on the nature of the

bration. our count pertains to a trivial total family, i.e. the zero locus of a polynomial of
bi-degree (1, 4) in p1  p3. the degree 8 hypersurface calabi-yau in p2,2,2,1,1 is a pencil
of quartic surfaces bered over p1 in a dierent way, though the counting diers only by

a factor of two. specically, if we look at the gromov-witten invariants in the homology
class of d times the ber (for this example h11 = 2, one class coming from the p1 base,
one from the projective class of the k3 ber), we get twice the numbers computed above.

8.2. o(3)  p2

in this example, the rank of ud is now 3d + 1 which is two greater than the dimension
of m00(d, p2), so we must take c(top2)(ud). the interpretation is similar to the case of
o(4)  p3. we count the number of rational curves in a two-dimensional family of cubic
curves generated by three linearly independent sections of o(3) (cubics).

the numbers nd are: n1 = 21, n2 = 21, n3 = 18, n4 = 21, n5 = 21, n6 = 18, and so on,
repeating these three values (as far as we have computed them explicitly). some of the

numbers can be easily veried. for example, the space of cubics on p2 (three variables)

forms (modulo scale) a p9, while conics form a p5 and lines form a p2. in order for a

cubic curve to admit a line, the polynomial must factor into a linear polynomial times a

conic. to count the number of cubics in a p2 family which do so, we must look at the

intersection of p2  p2 with the image v of m : p2  p5  p9, which is just the map

of multiplication of polynomials. the poincare dual of the p2 family is just h 7, where h

is the hyperplane class. therefore, we wish to compute rv h = rp2p5 m(h). now the

map m is linear in each of the coecients (of the line and the polynomial of the conic),

so we have m(h) = h1 + h2, where the hi are the hyperplane classes in p2 and p5,
respectively. the integral just picks up the coecient of h 2
2 in (h1 + h2)7, which is 21.
note that the same analysis applies to n2, since we have already computed the number of

1 h 5

cubics factoring into a conic (times a line).

to compute n3 one needs more information about the discriminant locus of the p2

family. similar calculations have been done in [51], where the authors consider a calabi-

yau which is a bered by elliptic curves over a two-dimensional base. the numbers dier

from the ones we have computed, since the bration structure is dierent. nevertheless,

the repeating pattern of three numbers survives.

the numbers for db = df in the above table are the same as that for kp2 . as f1 is
the blowup of p2 at a point and the homology class of a curve in p2 pulled back to f1 is
b + f , this is what we expect.
