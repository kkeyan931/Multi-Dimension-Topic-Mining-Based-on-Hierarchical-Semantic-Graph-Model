abstract

we consider the simplest bosonictype s-matrix which is usually regarded as un-
physical due to the complex values of the nite volume ground state energy. while
a standard quantum eld theory interpretation of such a scattering theory is pre-
cluded, we argue that the physical situation described by this smatrix is of a
massive ising model perturbed by a particular set of irrelevant operators. the
presence of these operators drastically aects the stability of the original vacuum
of the massive ising model and its ultraviolet properties. this scenario is supported
by a numerical calculation of the energy levels of the model on a nite geometry
which shows a level crossing of the two lowest energy eigenvalues.

1 introduction

in recent years, remarkable progress has been witnessed in the study of the scaling region
nearby the xed points of the renormalization group (rg) of 2-d statistical models.
such progress has been possible thanks to new ideas related to the smatrix theory [1, 2]
and there is now a welldened program to analyse ocritical statistical models.
in
short, this usually consists in implementing the following steps: (a) a deformation of
a conformal field theory (cft) describing the critical point by means of a relevant
integrable operator which drives the model away from criticality; (b) a consequent de-
termination of the exact spectrum of the massive or massless excitations and the elastic
smatrix scattering amplitudes thereof; (c) and nally, a reconstruction of the ocritical
correlators by means of the form factor approach also accompanied by an analysis of
the nite size behaviour of the theory by means of the thermodynamics bethe ansatz
(tba). the scattering theory of the ising model in a magnetic eld [2] together with
the calculation of its correlators [3] provide an explicit example of a statistical model
solved away from criticality along the line of the above program. solutions for many
other ocritical models have also been found (see for instance [3-19]). hereinafter the
statistical models solved according to an smatrix program will be simply referred as
bootstrap models.

all known boostrap models greatly dier from each other by the nature of their spec-
trum, for the total number of particles and for the detailed structure of their scattering
amplitudes. however, looking at them as a whole, they share an important feature, which
consists in the fermionic nature of their scattering amplitudes. namely, the s-matrix in-
volving two identical particles takes the value 1 at the threshold of their s-channel, i.e.
saa(0) = 1 (for the notation see below). this condition was proved to be quite im-
portant in the further study of their oshell behaviour. in the thermodynamics bethe
ansatz calculations, for instance, fermionictype s-matrices lead to welldened integral
equations which  in all known models  provide real solutions for the ground state en-
ergy, in perfect agreement with the cft prediction [14, 15]. on the other hand, in the
form factor approach, fermionic smatrices give rise to spectral series of the correlation
functions with fast convergent properties (see for instance, [3, 9, 10, 11, 12]).

among the set of known solved models the peculiar absence of examples relative to
an smatrix of bosonictype, i.e. an s-matrix which satises the condition saa(0) = 1,
is indeed intriguing. what is the reason? while a widespread suspicion is that such
s-matrices are unphysical1, a full understanding of their features and also of their inter-

1 it is worth mentioning that in an example based on the algebraic bethe ansatz [20], which is a
dierent approach to that of this paper, it was shown that the physical vacuum of the theory could only
be constructed if the particles were of fermionic type.

pretation are still missing.

deeply related to the absence of models with a bosonictype smatrix, there is also
the question about the role played in the scattering theory by the socalled cdd factors.
it is well known that they give rise to ambiguity in the smatrix of a bootstrap system
and it seems therefore quite striking that all consistent boostrap models have managed
to successfully resolve this ambiguity.

the aim of this paper is to address some of the above questions. in particular, we
will draw some conclusions about the interpretation of the physical aspects which occur
in an integrable theory based on a bosonictype s-matrix. we will consider the simplest
nontrivial scattering theory of this kind, consisting of one selfconjugate particle a of
mass m, with the twoparticle s-matrix given by

saa() = 

sinh   i sin a
sinh  + i sin a  fa() .

(1.1)

unless explicitly stated, a is a real parameter which, for the invariance of the smatrix
under a  1  a, can be taken in the interval [0, 1/2]. in eq. (1.1)   1  2, where
i is the rapidity variable of each particle entering its relativistic dispersion relation
ei = m cosh i, pi = m sinh i. since the mandelstam variable s is given by s = (p1 +
p2)2 = 2m2(1 + cosh ), the threshold in this channel is reached when  = 0 and for the
s-matrix (1.1) we have

saa(0) =( 1

if a 6= 0 ;
1 if a = 0 ,

(1.2)

i.e. a bosonictype s-matrix except when a = 0. notice that the asymptotical behaviour
of this smatrix is given by lim s() = 1. as it will become clear in the next
section, the smatrix (1.1) can also be equivalently regarded as a pure cdd factor
added to an initial fermionictype smatrix.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we briey discuss the cdd factors
and their relation with a perturbed cft. in section 3 we discuss the diculties which
the bosonictype smatrix (1.1) pose both in the tba analysis and in the form factor
approach  diculties which prevents its interpretation in terms of a standard quantum
eld theory. section 4 is devoted to an interpretation of the bosonictype smatrix (1.1)
as the one coming from the critical ising model perturbed by a combination of relevant
and irrelevant operators. this combination induces an instability in the ground state
of the theory, in agreement with the results of the tba analysis for the bosonictype
smatrix (1.1). finally our conclusions are summarised in section 5.

2 cdd factors and deformations of cft

to analyse the scaling region around a critical point described by a cft, one usually
considers the deformation of the conformal action acf t by means of one of its relevant
operators (x)

a = acf t + z (x)d2x .

(2.1)

the resulting action  which describes a rg ow from the original cft to another xed
point  gives rise in the minkowski space to the scattering processes among the massless
or massive excitations present away from the critical point [2]. important simplications
occur when the action (2.1) denes an integrable quantum eld theory: in this case, in
fact, all the scattering processes are purely elastic and can be expressed in terms of the
two-particle scattering amplitudes sab(). on a general basis, these amplitudes satisfy
the unitarity and crossing symmetry conditions2

sab()sab() = 1 ;
sab() = sab(i  ) .

(2.2)

possible bound states which occur in the scattering processes are promoted to asymptotic
states so that the amplitudes satisfy the additional bootstrap equations

scd() = sbd(  iua
ab is the location of the simple pole in sab() which identies the

bc)sad( + iub

ac) ,

(2.3)

where u    u and iuc
bound state ac in the scattering channel aaab  aaab.

the solution of the above equations presents the wellknown ambiguity relative to
the cdd factors. let sab() be a set of functions with a minimum number of poles which
solve both eqs. (2.2) and (2.3). another solution of the rst equations (2.2) can easily
be obtained by multiplying each amplitude sab() by the socalled cdd factors, i.e. an
arbitrary product of functions fa() dened in eq. (1.1), sab()  cab() sab(), where
cab() = qnab
in fact, each fa() automatically satises eqs. (2.2) and hence
their product. additional constraints on such cdd factors may come from the bootstrap
equations (2.3), which they also have to satisfy. since the cdd factors do not introduce
extra poles in the physical sheet 0  im   , the conclusion is that the knowledge of
the structure of the bound states alone cannot uniquely x the scattering theory. this
ambiguity is not harmless since scattering theories which dier by cdd factors have a
distinct physical content, in particular a dierent ultraviolet behaviour3.

2for simplicity we consider here theories with a massive non-degenerate spectrum of self-conjugate

particles.

3a well known example is provided by the ane toda field theories [17, 18] which share the same

structure of bound states of some deformed cft but have dierent central charges [15].

3

how can we interpret smatrices which dier by cdd factors in terms of an underly-
ing action? the cdd factors do not spoil the integrable nature of the original smatrix,
simply because they add extra phaseshifts to the original elastic scattering amplitudes.
they also do not alter the structure of the bound states  an infrared property of theory.
since they mainly inuence the ultraviolet behaviour, it seems natural to assume that
smatrices related to one another by cdd factors are associated to integrable actions
which, in the vicinity of a xed point, may dier for insertion of irrelevant scalar operators
i(x)

a = acf t + z (x) d2x + iz i(x) d2x .

(2.4)

these irrelevant operators should preserve the set of conserved currents (or part of it) of
the original action (2.1) and they should also share the same symmetry properties of the
relevant operator (x). their presence has several consequences. from a rg point of
view, the irrelevant operators i(x) are associated to rg trajectories which ow into the
xed point, whereas the relevant operators are associated to those rg trajectories which
depart from it. hence, the simultaneous presence of relevant and irrelevant operators
gives rise to a rg trajectory which passes very closely to the xed point in question
without stopping at it (figure 1). in its vicinity, its action can be parameterised as in
(2.4). however, in order to have a consistent eld theory near this xed point, there
should be no competion between these two dierent operators. this condition is realised,
for instance, for the roaming trajectory of the toda field theories [19] which in each
neighborhood of the xed points it passes, may be regarded as a rg ow induced by a
combination of the relevant operator  = 1,3 and the irrelevant operator  = 3,1, for an
appropriate set of the couplings [21]. on the contrary, if there is competion between the
two sets of elds entering the action (2.4), there may be an instability of the ground state
of the theory at certain scale  which will spoil a quantum eld theory interpretation for
distance scales r  . as we will see, this is the scenario associated to the smatrix
(1.1).

3 diculties with the bosonictype smatrix

a deceptively simple smatrix aected by a cdd ambiguity is obtained by multiplying
a scattering amplitude saa() by 1 (which may be considered as a particular fa term,
2 +i()). if the original scattering theory does not have any bound states,
i.e. lim f 1
if there are no constraints coming from the nonlinear bootstrap equations (2.3),
i.e.
there is evidently no obstacle to this multiplication. consequently, by means of this
cdd factor we can swap from a fermionictype smatrix to a bosonic one and viceversa.
this is the case, for instance of the smatrix of the sinh-gordon model, which is given

4

by ssh = fb(), where b is a function of the coupling constant of the model [5]. the
result of this multiplication is in fact the bosonictype smatrix (1.1). for this reason,
the model associated to the smatrix (1.1) may be referred to as minus sinh-gordon
model (mshg).

there is, however, another way of looking at the smatrix (1.1). it may be seen, in
fact, as the one obtained by multiplying s = 1 by a cdd factor fa(). s = 1 is the
smatrix of the thermal ising model [4] and therefore the analysis of this bosonictype
smatrix may be pursued along the considerations presented in the previous section,
as will be done in section 4.
in the meantime, let us investigate what is the nature
of the problems which are posed by the bosonictype smatrix (1.1), regardless of its
interpretation. we will initially study its nite size and ultraviolet behaviour by means
of the tba approach and we will then proceed to the investigation of its form factors.

3.1 thermodynamical properties

there is a simple way to see that the theory dened by the s-matrix (1.2) presents some
problematic aspects from the point of view of a quantum eld theory. let us compute
in fact the free energy of such a theory on a cylinder of length l and radius r (with
l  r) by means of the tba approach [13, 14]. as usual, r1 can be interpreted as
the temperature of the onedimensional system living on an innite line, r1 = t . in
this approach, the partition function z(l, r) in the presence of a chemical potential 
(z  er) is given by

z(l, r) = exp [mlf (r)]

, f (r) =z +



cosh  log(1  ze())

(3.1)

where the pseudo-energy () satises the integral equation

(3.2)

with

() = i

d

log s =

2 sin a cosh 
sinh2  + sin2 a

.

at zero chemical potential z = 1, no matter how small a may be (but never zero), the
numerical solution of the above equations shows the existence of a critical value of the
variable r, such that for r < rc(a), the free energy assumes complex values (figure
2). since the tba equations provides the full resummation of the virial expansion of
z(l, r), rc(a) is then identied with the radius of convergence of the corresponding
series. the existence of this singularity indicates a non-trivial ultraviolet behaviour of

5

the theory, in particular, it precludes its standard interpretation in terms of a conformal
field theory deformed by a relevant operator4.

the singularity at r = rc(a) may be eectively regarded as due to a boseeinstein
condensation phenomenon. to show this, rstly notice that the partition function (3.1)
can be interpreted as that of a free bosonic gas of exitations |()i but with dispersion
relations which depend on the temperature [13]. in particular, for the energy e() of one
of these excitations |()i we have e()  ()/r, where () is solution of the integral
equation (3.2). hence, in a way completely similar to the fermionic case analysed in [22],
one can establish the equivalence between the partition function obtained in eq. (3.1) and
the one computed in terms of the following series

z(l, r) =



xn=0

zn h(n) . . . (1)|(1) . . . (n)ie((1)++(n)) ,

(3.3)

where the scalar product of the states is computed according to the commutation rules
of free bosonic particles, with a regularization given by

[(  )]2 

ml
2

cosh() (  ) .

(3.4)

in fact, for the partition function in (3.1) we have the following expansion in powers of
(ml)

z(l, r) = 1  (ml)f (r) +

(ml)2

2!

(f (r))2 +    (1)n (ml)n

(3.5)

f (r) = 

xn=0

cosh  en() .

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

on the other hand, computing the partition function by using the expression (3.3),

z(l, r) = 1 + zz1 + z2z2 +    znzn +   

4 the problem with the ultraviolet behaviour of such theory can also be seen without having recourse
to numerical integration of the above equations. in fact, in consistent theories, the ultraviolet behaviour
is ruled by the socalled kink conguration of eq. (3.2) and the corresponding dilogarithmic functions.
in our case the plateau of the kink conguration, solution of algebraic equation pl = log(1  epl) is in
fact complex, pl = i 
3 .

etc. hence, the series (3.5) precisely coincides with that of eq. (3.8), the only dierence
being in the arrangement of the single terms: the terms proportional to (ml) in all zn
gives f (r) as their sum, whereas the sum of the terms proportional to (ml)n appearing
in all zn gives rise to the higher power (f (r))n.

with this interpretation, it is then natural to expect that the partition function (3.1)
will have a singularity at that value of the temperature r1
c (a) where the energy of the
excitation (at zero rapidity) vanishes (figure 3). when this happens, the contribution
coming from the average occupation number with e = 0 becomes as important as the
entire series, producing a singularity in the free energy which resembles that of the usual
boseeinstein condensation. one should not be surprised that such eect occurs in this
low dimensional system for the entanglement of the energy e() of its excitation with
the temperature itself of the system. in conclusion, from the tba analysis one infers
that in our bosonictype model there is a scale of distance  = rc below which there is
a change in the ground state of the theory.

3.2 form factors

let us now analyse the computation of the form factors associated to the smatrix (1.1).
as we will see, this calculation presents some new and distinct features with respects the
analogous calculation for fermionictype theories.

the denition of the form factors of a local hermitian scalar operator o is given as

usual by

f o(1, . . . , n) = h0|o|a(1), . . . , a(n)i .

(3.11)

these quantities satisfy a set of functional equations [6, 7]

f o
n (1, . . . , i, i+1, . . . , n) = f o

n (1, . . . , i+1, i, . . . , n)s(i  i+1) ,

(   )f o

which closely resemble those of the sinhgordon theory [23].

for scalar operators, the ff depend solely on the rapidity dierences ij = i  j.
as it is evident from the residue equation in (3.12), the chain of ff with even and odd
number of particles are decoupled from each other. for simplicity, in the sequel we will
consider only ff of even operators under the z2 symmetry of the model (i.e.
those
which have only nonvanishing ff on an even number of external states). they can be
correspondingly parameterised as

f o

n (1, . . . , n) = hn

fmin(ij)

(3.13)

where xi = ei, hn is a normalization constant and fmin() is a function which satises
the equations

fmin()

= s() fmin() ,
fmin(i  ) = fmin(i + ) .

(3.14)

qn(x1, . . . , xn) are symmetric polynomials in the variables x1, . . . , xn of total degree
tn = n
2 (2n  1). they can be expressed in terms of the socalled elementary symmetric
polynomials (n)

given by5

equivalently, they can be obtained in terms of the generating function

(3.16)

although at a formal level, the above formulas of the ff appear identical to those of the
sinhgordon model (except for the extra factor (n)
2 in the denominator), a substantial
dierence between the two models occurs in the properties of fmin(). as we will see,
this dierence has farreaching consequences.

which is in stark contrast with the value fmin(0) = 0 of fermionictype theories, which
is forced by the condition s(0) = 1 of their smatrix. the asymptotical behaviour of
fmin(, a) is ruled by

2# .

finally, in the limit a  0, fmin(, a) reduces to

fmin(, 0) =

.

(3.21)

(3.22)

in order to implement the recursive equations associated to the last equation in (3.12) it
is useful to consider the functional equation6

fmin( + i, a)fmin(, a) =

2i2n 2(a)

sinh  + i sin a

.

(3.23)

the residue equation in (3.12) implies that the polynomials qn(x1, . . . , xn) in eq. (3.13),
satisfy the recursive equations

qn+2(x, x, x1, . . . , xn) = x3d(x, x1, . . . , xn) qn(x1, . . . , xn) ,

(3.24)

(3.25)

6 plugging  = 0 in (3.23), one obtains the relation f (a) = 22n 2(a)
sin a .

9

in writing eq. (3.24) we have posed for convenience

hn+2 = hn

sin a

(2i sin af (a))n .

(3.26)

since d(x, x1, . . . , xn) contains four elementary symmetric polynomials and each of them
is linear in the individual variables xi, the partial degrees pn of the polynomials qn
satises the condition pn+2  4 + pn.

after these general considerations, let us now attempt to solve the above recursive
equations for a particular but signicant eld. namely, let us assume that there is an
operator in the theory which plays the role of the trace (x) of the stressenergy tensor
t(x). if such an operator exists, its form factors have some distinguished properties
which may be useful in their explicit determination. first of all, its normalization will
be given by

f (i) = ha()|(0)|a()i = 2m2 .

(3.27)

secondly, from the conservation law t(x) = 0, the polynomials qn(x1, . . . , xn) can
be factorised as qn(x1, . . . , xn) = 1n1pn(x1, . . . , xn). moreover, assuming that this
operator is even under the z2 symmetry of the model, its only nonvanishing ff will
be those with an even number of external particles. finally, the twopoint correlation
function of (x) enters a sumrule which permits evaluation of the dierence of the
central charges of the theory by going from the large to the short distance scales [27]

(3.29)

since at the large distance scale the theory is massive, we will have cir = 0, and the
above sumrule should provide a determination of the central charge cuv of the theory
in its ultraviolet regime. the rst approximation of the above sumrule is obtained by
the twoparticle contribution

c (2)(a) =

(3.30)

with this information on the ff of (x), let us proceed in the computation of its rst
representatives. since in the limit a  0, our bosonictype smatrix reduces to the one

10

of thermal ising model  for which the only nonvanishing ff of (x) is the one relative
to the twoparticle state

we are forced to take as q2(x1, x2)

notice that by inserting the twoparticle ff in (3.30), the corresponding quantity is
an increasing function of the parameter a, which takes its minimum value c (2) = 1
2
at a = 0 (as in the thermal ising model) and reaches its maximum c (2) = 0.876... at
a = 1
2 (see figure 4). this increasing monotonic behaviour of c (2)(a) is in contrast with
the decreasing monotonic behaviour presented by the same quantity for fermionictype
theories (see for instance the sinh-gordon model [23]).

using now the factorised form q4(x1, . . . , x4) = 13p4(x1, . . . , x4) and the above

expression for q2(x1, x2), the recursive equation satised by p4(x1, . . . , x4) becomes

p4(x, x, x1, x2) = 4(cid:2)x8  x62

in the linear space of the symmetric polynomials with total degree t = 10 and par-
tial degree p  5, the above recursive equation does not uniquely x the polynomial
p4(x1, . . . , x4), which in fact admits a threeparameter family of solutions

this arbitrariness in the fourparticle ff of (x) may be partially reduced by imposing an
additional condition on its ff, namely that they fulll the cluster equations [15, 25, 26]

f 
2 (1, 2) f 

2 (3, 4) .

(3.35)

by using the cluster properties of the elementary symmetric polynomials k, as deter-
mined in [15], together with the asymptotical behaviour eq. (3.21) of fmin(, a) and the
vacuum expectation value hi = m2
2 sin a, the cluster equation (3.35) provides the following
conditions on the constants a1 and a2

a1 = 1 , a2 = 4 .

(3.36)

11

however, the constant a3 cannot be xed in this way, since all terms proportional to it
in (3.34) are subleading in the above limit (3.35). this arbitrariness of the ff of (x),
which persists for higher ff, shows that in the mshg model the smatrix alone cannot
uniquely x the matrix elements of one of its signicant operators. this arbitrariness
in the ff of (x) should be contrasted with their unique determination in all known
examples of fermionictype smatrix7 (see, for instance [3, 9, 12, 23]).

concerning the ctheorem sum rule, some conclusions can be also drawn despite
the arbitrariness present in the ff of (x). namely, let us assume that the arbitrary
constants present at each stage of the recursive equations could be xed according to
some additional principle. what will then be the generic behaviour of the series (3.29)
entering the ctheorem? for the niteness of the value assumed by the ff at all particle
thresholds, an estimate of the integral (3.28) can be provided by only considering the
contributions at all thresholds. to do so, let us rst observe that the sum (3.29)  apart
from the prefactor 12/3 , is an integral of the square of each ff integrated on the
phasespace 2k() of 2k particle, dened as

2k() =z

concerning the value of the f2k(1, . . . , 2k) at their threshold (ij = 0, for all i and
j), we can split it into two terms: the rst one is the product of h2k together with all
fmin(0), given by

h2

(sin a)k1

(2i sin af (a))k(k1) (f (a))k(2k1) = 

for the remaining term, we can pose

an estimate of the ratio  =

values assumed by the elementary symmetric polynomials j at i = 0 (denoted by j)

7it is easy to check that also higher form factors of z2 odd operators (as the one which creates the

particle a of the mshg model) cannot uniquely xed.

k !  4k. at the threshold, in the space of symmetric polynomials of total
k =   2k
degree k(4k  1) and partial degree 2(2k  1), the term which is expected to dominate
in the limit k   is given by [(k)4k32k]  162k2 3
2 k, so that   16 and the ratio 
is therefore expected to be always larger than 1.

let us now apply the above considerations to the ctheorem sumrule. we will approx-
imate the integral (3.28) by using the mean theorem, applied in each interval between
all successive thresholds. apart from some constants, the series entering eq. (3.28) has
the following behaviour8

where

c xk

the nature of the series (3.41) is obviously controlled by the parameter x(a): since the
ratio f (a)
2 sin a entering x(a) is always larger than 1.6.. ( see figure 5) and  is expected to
be larger than 1, we conclude that, due to the nite value assumed by the ff at the higher
thresholds, the series (3.41) is always divergent. this divergence should be regarded as a
manifestation of the pathological aspect of the quantum eld theory associated to mshg
model in its ultraviolet region, as we already learnt by the tba approach.

4 irrelevant deformations of the ising model

with the above insights to the nature of the problems presented by the bosonictype s
matrix (1.1), let us come back to the considerations of section 2 with the aim to identify
an underlying action for such an smatrix. we will take the point of view in which fa()
in eq. (1.1) is seen as a cdd factor for the fermionic smatrix s = 1. the latter is
identied as the one of the thermal ising model. hence, we have to look for irrelevant
operators in this model which both preserve its original integrability and its z2 symmetry
such that the extra phaseshift which they induce matches with the cdd factor fa().
in fact, we
have the operators of the conformal family of the identity i (which includes the stress
energy tensor t), those of the conformal family of the energy eld e and nally those
of the magnetization eld . the operators of the even sector of this model, i.e. those

in the conformal ising model there are few operators we can play with:

8eq. (3.41) holds for a 6= 0. for a = 0, the ctheorem gives c = 1

2 , as in the massive ising model.

13

of identity and energy families, can be written in terms of local expressions of the chiral
(z) and antichiral (z) components of a majorana fermionic eld. in particular we
have e(z, z) = i (z)(z) and, for the analytic and antianalytic part of the stress energy
tensor, t (z) = 1

2 :  : and t = 1

2 :    : .

the original fermionictype smatrix s = 1 originates from the cft action per-

turbed by the relevant operator of the energy eld

a = acf t + mz e(x)d2x .

in the euclidean space it may be written as

a =

1

2 z (  +   + 2im ) d2x .

(4.1)

(4.2)

let us analyse which operators we can add to this action in order to have an extra phase
shift in the smatrix. none of these operators can be of the magnetic eld family as they
would spoil both its z2 symmetry and its integrability [16, 28, 29]. they cannot be either
descendent elds of the energy eld, since they are all quadratic in the fermionic eld:
their insertion in the action (4.2) will not induce scattering processes among the fermion
particles but will only change their dispersion relations. hence, the rst irrelevant eld
which can be introduced in (4.1) in order to have extra scattering processes is t t . this
operator is in fact quartic in the fermion elds and the new action becomes

a =

1

2 z (cid:0)  +   + 2im (cid:1) d2x +

g

2m2 z     d2x +   

(4.3)

where g is a dimensionless constant. with the insertion of this operator, the theory is still
integrable at the lowest order [30] although a in (4.3) should be considered at this stage
as an eective action. the coupling constant g can be related to the parameter a entering
the smatrix (1.1) as follows. since the operator t t is expected to be eective at very
highenergy scales, this suggests matching the lowest order coming from the perturbation
theory of (4.3) with the smatrix (1.1), both computed in their highenergy limit. in
this kinematical regime the two particles involved in the scattering can be eectively seen
as left and right movers. their momenta p and q may be parameterised in terms of a
new rapidity variable  as p = me1, q = me2, so that the mandelstam variable s is
expressed in this limit as s = 2m2e12. the lowest order in g of the scattering amplitude
in this regime may be computed as in [31] with the result

s(s)  1 + 2ig

s
m 2 +   

(4.4)

let us now compare this expression with the one from the expansion of the smatrix
(1.1) around the point 12 = . by setting 1/ sinh 12  e12 as a parameterization

14

around 12 = , the smatrix (1.1) may be written in the vicinity of this point as

s(12) =

s + i m2
sin a
s  i m2

sin a

 1 + 2i sin a

s
m2 +   

so that we have the identication

g  sin a  a

(4.5)

(4.6)

i.e. g is a positive quantity.

by literally considering (4.3) as the action of the theory, there is a simple method to
study its spectrum. in fact, we can compute the energy levels of the model on an innite
cylinder of radius r by means of the truncated conformal space approach [32]. this
method consists in evaluating the matrix elements of the hamiltonian associated to the
action (4.3) on the basis of the conformal space of the model (with periodic boundary
condition) and numerically diagonalised it by keeping a sucient number of states. the
results of this analysis (with 25 conformal states kept) can be found in figure 6.

figure 6.a shows the rst energy levels versus the scaling variable mr for the thermal
ising model associated to the initial action (4.1): above the ground state line, there is
the rst excited level which corresponds to the energy of the oneparticle state of mass
m on a nite volume whereas the next two levels are identied as threshold lines for the
twoparticle state. in these gures the numerical value of the mass m has been chosen
as 1.

figure 6.b only shows the lowest two energy lines once the coupling constant g has
been switched on: at a large distance scale, the two lines are separated by the same mass
gap m as in in figure 6.a but at the short distance scale, no matter how small g may
be, there is always a value of mr where these two levels tend to collide (an eect which
increases with the level of truncation). when this happens, there is an obvious instability
in the original vacuum of the model which precludes a smooth interpolation of the theory
going from the infrared to the ultraviolet region, i.e. the scenario which was shown by
the tba calculation.

let us nally add a few comments on the full hamiltonian of the theory. since the
action (4.3) also contains higher derivative terms n  n , the full hamiltonian will

may be conveniently written in terms of a dimensionless kernel v (z), (z = mz), as

be a nonlocal one. in the majorana basis9 denoted as before by (cid:0)(x, t), (x, t)(cid:1), it
h =z :(cid:2)ix + i x  + 2i (cid:3) : dx + gm2z z :  : (x)v (xy) :  : (y) dxdy
9in this basis 0 =  0

so that the coupling constants of the higher derivative terms are nothing but the higher
moments of v (z). in the form of eq. (4.7), the hamiltonian results renormalisable albeit
nonlocal. however, the important point is not about the renormalizability of the theory
but rather that if v (z)  0, the nonlocal term causes an instability in the system. to this
aim, it is sucient to consider the hamiltonian (4.7) in the hartreefock approximation
by introducing an order parameter  = ih:  :i. for eld congurations which do
not vary on x, the value of the hamiltonian (4.7) for unit volume is given by

h
l

= m  gv2 ,

(4.8)

where v = r v (z)dz > 0. when g = 0, we can always subtract from h/l an innite

constant (due to the dirac sea of the fermion) such that the minimum of h/l is reached
for  = 0. this subtraction is equivalent to a selection of the vacuum state for the free
theory. however, when we switch on a positive value of g, the quantity h/l becomes
once again unbounded from below, so that there is an instability of the vacuum originally
selected by the free theory.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have discussed the physical properties of the simplest bosonictype s
matrix with the aim to clarify the nature of its pathological behaviour, in particular at
its shortdistance scales. the tba approach and also the numerical diagonalisation of
an hamiltonian which may be associated to such smatrix, have both shown that the
diculties consist in an instability of the vacuum state of the theory which occurs at a
certain distance or energy scale. even in the absence of the above methods, the peculiar
physical behaviour of the qft associated to a bosonic smatrix may be inferred by the
computation of its form factors. we have seen in fact that even with some stringent
constraints imposed on the matrix elements they are intrinsically largely undetermined.
moreover, the spectral series which originate from them are generically divergent.

several questions arise in relation to the observations of the previous sections. for
instance, it would be interesting to analyse the qft associated to more general cdd
factors and characterise those which have a smooth interpolation from the short to the
large distance scales. moreover, actions which are initially obtained by a perturbation
of irrelevant elds contain an innite series of corrections due to the higher dimension
operators and hence they are generally nonlocal. in this respect, it would be useful to
have a criterion to identify those nonlocal theories which give rise to integrable models.
