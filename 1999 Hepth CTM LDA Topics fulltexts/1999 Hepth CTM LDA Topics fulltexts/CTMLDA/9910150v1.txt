abstract

it is shown that certain extremal correlators in four-dimensional n = 2 superconformal eld
theories (including n = 4 super-yang-mills as a special case) have a free-eld functional form.
it is further argued that the coupling constant dependence receives no correction beyond the
lowest order. these results hold for any nite value of nc.

introduction

in an interesting recent article dhoker et al [1] have shown that certain extremal correlation
functions are free in ads supergravity. these authors also gave some arguments for this to be
true for the cft correlators corresponding to those supergravity correlators according to the
maldacena conjecture [2]. further one-loop and instanton checks have been given in [3]. in this
note we show that the non-renormalisation of such correlators can be understood very simply
in non-perturbative superconformal eld theory as a consequence of the superconformal ward
identities and the constrained nature of the harmonic superelds that appear in the theory. we
further show that these simplications hold in any nite n = 2 scft and not just the n = 4
sym theory (at least for the correlators of n = 2 matter multiplets). we also argue that the
result could be extended to another class of subextremal correlators.

the reason that the ward identities in superconformal theories are stronger than one might
naively expect is not because some of the invariants, i.e. cross-ratios, that occur in non-super-
symmetric conformal eld theories do not have supersymmetric extensions, but rather because
all the basic eld strengths and matter multiplets in four-dimensional supersymmetric theories
are described by constrained superelds. these constraints, when taken together with the
superconformal ward identities, may lead to much stronger results than those that follow for
non-supersymmetric theories from conformal invariance alone. for example, the chiral nature of
the matter supereld in n = 1 theories can be exploited to determine the anomalous dimension
of operators composed from this eld [4]. the same is true for the gauge eld strength superelds
in n = 1 and n = 2 yang-mills. the remaining supermultiplets that occur in four-dimensional
theories with rigid extended supersymmetry are the n = 2 matter multiplet and the n = 4
yang-mills multiplet. the former has an o-shell harmonic superspace formulation [5] which can
be used to give a complete description of the quantum theory including its feynman rules and
superconformal properties. while only an on-shell harmonic superspace formulation [6] is known
for the latter it can still be used to investigate the properties of the correlation functions under
superconformal transformations. both of these multiplets are described by superelds which
satisfy simple constraints: the superelds obey the condition of grassmann (g-)analyticity (an
analog of chirality in n = 1 theories) and are harmonic (h-)analytic (a dynamical property of
n = 2 matter [5] which can also be extended to n = 4 sym [6]). these constraints mean
that such superelds depend on only half of the number of grassmann odd coordinates in the
full superspace, as in the case of chiral superelds, and that they depend analytically on the
coordinates of the internal coset space which is adjoined to super minkowski space to form
harmonic superspace. we shall refer to such superelds as analytic superelds in the following.

in references [7, 8] a systematic study of the superconformal ward identities and their conse-
quences for greens functions of n = 2 and n = 4 analytic operators was initiated. the n = 2
operators are gauge-invariant products of the hypermultiplet q and the n = 4 operators are
gauge-invariant products of the n = 4 eld strength w . (we shall use the notation op to de-
note operators of the form tr(qp) or tr(w p).) this approach has led to a number of interesting
results [7, 8], in particular: the n = 4 sym eld strength is a covariantly analytic scalar super-
eld w from which the aforementioned set of analytic gauge-invariant operators can be built;
the two- and three-point greens functions of these operators were determined up to constants
[7, 9] (see also [10]); the set of all non-nilpotent analytic superconformal invariants was given [8].
it was also conjectured that the superconformal ward identities and the constrained nature of
the harmonic superelds might be suciently strong to determine certain correlation functions
up to constants [7, 8].

1

it has subsequently emerged that the n = 4 operators considered above play an important
role in the maldacena conjecture and are in one-to-one correspondence with the kaluza-klein
multiplets of iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [11]. however, although the ward identities, when
combined with grassmann and harmonic analyticity, do put constraints on the functions of
superinvariants that can arise for correlators with four or more points, these constraints do not
seem to be enough [12, 13] to determine completely the n = 2 correlators that contain four
harmonic composite matter elds of charge two, contrary to the claim for future work made in
[7, 8]. the situation is very dierent, however, for four-point correlation functions of analytic
operators for which the sum of three of the charges (i.e. powers of w or q in a given operator)
is equal to the charge on the fourth. these are the extremal correlators discussed in [1, 3].

in this paper we consider such extremal correlation functions in n = 4 or n = 2 sym theories.
they have the form

< op1op2op3op4 >

where p4 = p3

i=1 pi. we shall show that the superconformal ward identities together with
analyticity imply that they can be solved for and that they can be expressed as products of
two-point functions. this will demonstrate part of the conjecture of dhoker et al [1], but it is
a stronger result in the sense that it is valid for any gauge group su (nc) and not only in the
limit nc  . furthermore, these results hold also for any n = 2 scft and not just n = 4, at
least for composite operators made out of hypermultiplets. the reason why these correlators are
soluble, while the case p1 = . . . = p4 = 2 considered in [12, 13] is not, is related to their dierent
forms when expressed in terms of products of two-point functions multiplied by a function of
superconformal invariants. the singularities of the latter in the internal coordinates must be
compensated for by the zeros of the former, because all correlation functions have to be analytic.
for the extremal correlators the structure of the two-point function prefactor allows essentially
no freedom for the function of invariants; it must be a constant.

the superconformal ward identities alone do not determine the dependence of a correlator on
the coupling constant. however, information on this dependence can be extracted by using
the reduction formula, rst introduced in the context of four-dimensional scft by intriligator
[14]. this formula relates the derivative of an n-point function with respect to the coupling to
an (n + 1)-point function with one insertion of a bilinear operator and an integration over the
insertion point. in the n = 4 case the inserted operator is the supercurrent t = o2 while in
the n = 2 case the insertion into correlators of g-analytic superelds is the chiral pure sym
lagrangian. consideration of this reduction formula led to the realisation [14] that there must
be nilpotent superinvariants since only such invariants can contribute in the integration over
the insertion point. nilpotent invariants exist for correlators with ve or more points [15, 16].
their absence for (n  4)-point correlators has been used to argue that two-and three-point
correlators of analytic operators are not renormalised [15]. here we shall use the reduction
formula to argue that the extremal four-point correlators are not renormalised as a consequence
of the absence of nilpotent invariants with the required analyticity properties. we also show that
the same argument implies the non-renormalisation of another class of operators, subextremal
i=1 pi  2. note, however, that when using the reduction formula we make the

(plausible) assumption that there are no undesired contributions from contact terms [16, 17].

2 extremal correlators as constrained superconformal

covariants

let us begin by considering an n-point correlator in n = 2 or n = 4 scft for the operators
op discussed above. such a correlator, if its leading term in an expansion in odd coordinates
does not vanish, can be written in the form

g :=< op1op2 . . . opn >= yr<s

(grs)mrsf

(1)

where f is some function of the invariants, the mrs  msr are non-negative integers and the grs
are the free two-point functions of charge one operators (in n = 2 these are just the hypermul-
tiplet propagators). it is easy to see that this form for g does solve the superconformal ward
identities because the propagator satises

(vr + vs + r + s)grs = 0

(2)

where v is the vector eld generating a superconformal transformation in analytic superspace
and  is the associated analytic density function, and because the transformation rule for a eld
of charge p is

the mrs must obey the equations

whence it follows that

op = v op + pop .

pr = xs, r6=s

(8)

to be more concrete we now focus on four-point extremal correlators in the n = 2 theory. the
simplest example is g :=< o2(1)o2(2)o2(3)o6(4) > where the os are made out of hypermul-
tiplets. it can be written in the following form:

g = (g14)2(g24)2(g34)2f

(7)

where f is a function of super-invariants. the two-point function grs is the propagator for free
hypermultiplets,

yrs

rs
where xrs = xr  xs, etc., and yrs = yrs  rsx1
rs rs. the variables  and  are the fermionic
coordinates of analytic superspace carrying undotted and dotted spinor indices respectively and
y is the standard local coordinate on the coset space u (1)\su (2) = cp1.

grs =

let us now discuss the function f depending on the superconformal invariants. for four points
there are no nilpotent invariants [15], which means that the supersymmetric extension of an

3

ordinary minkowski or internal space invariant is unique, or in other words that all invariants
are specied by their body. the two non-trivial invariants with respect to the x conformal
transformations are the cross-ratios

s =

14x2
x2
23
x2
12x2
34

t =

13x2
x2

12x2
34

and the non-trivial invariant with respect to the y conformal transformations is

v =

y14y23
y12y34

.

(9)

(10)

the quantity w = y13y24
is conformally invariant, but can be written in terms of v, namely
y12y34
w = 1 + v. thus for four points in analytic superspace, there are three independent invariants.
any basis set whose body can be solved for the cross-ratios s, t, v may be chosen, for instance
[8]

s =

sdet x14sdet x23
sdet x12sdet x34

, t =

sdet x13sdet x24
sdet x12sdet x34

and

u = str(x1

34 x41x1

12 x23)

(11)

(12)

where x is a (2|n ) by (2|n ) matrix coordinatising a patch on analytic superspace and xrs
denotes a coordinate dierence.

the superconformal invariants s, t can be written as

where

s =

s

, t =

t
w

v =

y23 y14
y12 y34

,

w =

y13 y24
y12 y34

.

(13)

(14)

it is clear that both of these objects and also u contain singularities in y. at the same time, a
correlation function of gauge-invariant composite operators made out of hypermultiplets must
be analytic in y. this implies that the function f in equation (6) must depend on the superin-
variants in such a way that the singularities in y that appear in f are cancelled by the zeros in
y contained in the propagators. furthermore, this must be true to all orders in . to examine
this issue we will need to know the dependence of the superinvariants on y and , . it turns
out that the singularities cannot be cancelled in the extremal case, so that the function f can
only be a constant.

we write the nilpotent parts of w and the superconformal invariant u as w and u respec-
tively, namely

w = 1 + v + w,

u = 1  t + s + v + u .

(15)

according to the argument above we can, by taking appropriate functions of s, t, u , construct
three superconformal invariants whose leading terms are given by s, t and v
s . these supercon-
formal invariants are

s = sv,

t  = t (1 + v ),

finally, we are in a position to show that f is a constant as a consequence of the analyticity of
the extremal correlators in their dependence on y. taylor-expanding to rst order in u and
w we nd that

f (s + s, t + t, z) = f (s, t, z) +

(20)

(21)

now, the correlation function must be analytic, but the variable z contains a singularity in
y12y34. strictly speaking, we consider the singularities in y12 y34. it is a special feature of the
extremal case that the factors of y in the two-point functions that multiply f can never cancel
such a singularity and hence f does not depend on z. we now consider the terms in f which are
rst order in , that is, in u and w. since these terms have independent spinor structures
and go like v and we are taking v  0, we must conclude that

and

df = 0,

df = 0 .

(22)

(23)

by considering the coecient of each power of z in the rst equation, it is straightforward to
show that f is actually a constant. clearly, the second equation is then automatically satised.

the same conclusion can be reached using n = 4 harmonic superspace for a similar correlator
with three charge two operators (i.e. supercurrents) and one charge six operator. in this case
one has the same form for g but the two-point function is now dierent. it takes the form

grs =

y2
rs
x2
rs

(24)

, a , yaa

where yrs = yrs  rsx1
rs rs as before, the only dierence being that the odd coordinates
and y now carry internal indices as well. the coordinates of n = 4 analytic superspace are
(x , a
) where each index can take on two values and the internal indices are treated
in the same way as the spacetime spinor indices. in the n = 4 case there are four independent
super-invariants at four points corresponding to the fact that there are two independent space-
time cross-ratios and two independent internal space cross-ratios each of which has a unique
extension to a super-invariant. again, all of these are singular in such a way that the singulari-
ties cannot be cancelled by the prefactor gm in the extremal correlator, and hence we conclude
that the only function of super-invariants that one can have is in fact a constant.

3 four-point correlators and the reduction formula

we now consider the question of non-renormalisation of the coecient multiplying the propa-
gators in the expression for the four-point correlators discussed above. this can be done either
in the n = 4 formalism or in n = 2. in this note we shall give the n = 2 version since it
is applicable to an arbitrary n = 2 superconformal theory. in this sense the results obtained
are stronger than the n = 4 ones, although they only apply to the hypermultiplet sector of
the theory. furthermore, in this section we shall use the manifestly su (2)-covariant harmonic
superspace formalism of reference [5].

the four-point correlators we discuss involve gauge-invariant composite operators opr = tr(qpr )
made out of pr hypermultiplets:

hop1(1) . . . op4(4)i  hp1p2p3p4i .

(25)

the requirement of gauge invariance puts the natural restriction pr  2 on the allowed values of
the charges. as stated earlier, such correlators should have two fundamental properties: super-
conformal covariance (follows from the niteness of the theory) and harmonic (h-)analyticity.
the latter is a dynamical property which can be explained as follows.

in the su (2)-covariant harmonic superspace the hypermultiplet is described o shell by a grass-
mann (g-)analytic supereld q+(xa, +, +, u).
in it the harmonic variables are dened as
su (2) matrices,

u  su (2)  u

i = (u+i) ,

u+iu

i = 1

(26)

where the su (2) indices i = 1, 2 are raised and lowered in the usual way. all harmonic functions
are homogeneous under the action of a u (1) group counting the charges (like  for u), so that
they eectively live on the coset s2  u (1)\su (2). further, the grassmann variables

+ = u+

i i,

+  = u+
i

i 

(27)

i u

a = x  
j together with +, + and u form a basis in the g-analytic superspace closed

are su (2)-invariant u (1) projections of the full superspace ones i, i. finally, x 
4i(i  j) u+
under the full n = 2 superconformal group.
it should be stressed that the o-shell hypermultiplet supereld q+(xa, +, +, u) involves an
innite number of auxiliary elds coming from its expansion on s2. on shell q+ obeys the free
eld equation

d++q+(xa, +, +, u) = 0

where

d++ = u+i/ui  2i+ + /x 
a

(28)

(29)

is the harmonic derivative in g-analytic superspace. expanding equation (28) in both the
grassmann and harmonic variables, one can show that all the auxiliary elds are eliminated and
the remaining physical scalars and spinors are put on shell.

the above o-shell formulation of the hypermultiplet allows one to develop standard feynman
rules [18]. in this context one can argue that the correlator (25) obeys equations of the schwinger-
dyson type, e.g., at point r,

d++

r

hp1p2p3p4i = contact terms ,

r = 1, . . . , 4 .

(30)

6

in our analysis of superconformal covariants we always make the assumption that the points are
kept apart in order to avoid space-time singularities. then eq. (30) becomes the condition of
exact h-analyticity:

d++

r

hp1p2p3p4i = 0 ,

r = 1, . . . , 4

if point 1 6= . . . 6= point 4 .

(31)

as we have seen in section 2, the combination of superconformal covariance and h-analyticity
puts strong restrictions on the allowed form of such correlators expressed in terms of the coor-
dinates of g-analytic superspace xa, +, +, u. however, such arguments cannot predict the
dependence on the gauge coupling constant. the latter can be very eciently determined by
using the reduction formula of ref.
[14] (for an explanation in the context of n = 2 harmonic
superspace see [16]). this formula relates the derivative of the 4-point correlator (25) with re-
spect to the (complex) coupling constant  to a 4 + 1-point correlator obtained by inserting the
n = 2 sym action:




hp1p2p3p4i  z d4xl0d40htr w 2(0)(q+)p1(1) . . . (q+)p4(4)i .
here w (xl, i) is the eld strength of n = 2 sym and ln =2 sy m =  1
4 tr w 2 is the cor-
responding lagrangian. note that unlike the matter superelds q+ which are g-analytic and
harmonic-dependent o shell, w is chiral and harmonic-independent. the integral in the reduc-
tion formula (32) goes over the chiral insertion point 0. as we shall see later on, the combination
of chirality with g-analyticity, in addition to conformal supersymmetry and h-analyticity, turns
out to be extremely restrictive.

(32)

so, from now on we shall concentrate on the 4 + 1-point correlators

h0p1p2p3p4i

(33)

which are chiral at point 0 and g-analytic at points 1, . . . , 4, have the corresponding supercon-
formal properties and are also h-analytic,

d++

r

h0p1p2p3p4i = 0 ,

r = 1, . . . , 4

if point 0 6= . . . 6= point 4 .

(34)

indeed, the expansion of the matter supereld
in addition, they carry a certain r-weight.
q+ = i(x)u+
i + . . . starts with the physical doublet of scalars of the n = 2 hypermultiplet
which have no r-weight. on the contrary, the n = 2 sym eld strength w = . . . +f(x)
contains the ym eld strength f (r-weight 0) in a term with two left-handed s, so the r-
weight of w equals 2 and that of the lagrangian equals 4. from (32) it is clear that this
weight is compensated by that of the chiral superspace measure d4xld4, so the correlator in
the left-hand side of eq. (32) is weightless.

the task now is to explicitly construct superconformal covariants of r-weight 4 out of the
coordinates of chiral superspace xl0, i
0 at the insertion point 0 and of g-analytic harmonic
superspace xar, +
ri, r = 1, . . . , 4 at the matter points. to this end we need to know
the transformation properties of these coordinates under q and s supersymmetry (parameters
 and , correspondingly) [19]:

we remark that q supersymmetry acts as a simple shift of the grassmann variables, whereas
s supersymmetry is non-linear. nevertheless, part of the s transformation is shift-like (the
terms x 
in (36)), as long as we are allowed to invert the
xs. this is possible due to our choice to keep away from any singularities in x-space. thus,
we can use the four left-handed parameters i and x  i
to shift away the two left-handed

spinors i
0 at the chiral point (we count the u (1) projections of the su (2) doublet i = 1, 2)
and two of the left-handed +
. this means that our correlators eectively depend on two
left-handed spinor coordinates. we can make this counting argument more explicit by forming
combinations of the s which are invariant under q supersymmetry and under the shift-like
part of s supersymmetry. q supersymmetry obviously suggests to use the combinations

r = 1, . . . , 4 .

then we can form the following two cyclic combinations of three 
0r:

(12r)  = (12)r  + (2r)1  + (r1)2  ,

r = 3, 4

where

r  = x2

0r (x0r0r) 

(37)

(38)

(39)

and x0r  xl0  xar are translation-invariant and (rs)  u+i
si are su (2)-invariant combina-
tions of the space-time and harmonic coordinates, correspondingly. it is now easy to check that
12r are completely shift-invariant, i.e.,

r u+

here one makes use of the harmonic cyclic identity

q+s12r = o(2) .

(rs)ti + (st)ri + (tr)si = 0 .

(40)

(41)

let us now inspect the structure of the correlator (33) more closely. as we noted earlier, it
has r-weight 4.
in superspace the only objects carrying r-weight are the odd coordinates,
so the  expansion of our correlator must start with the product of four left-handed ones. in
other words, the correlator should be nilpotent [15, 16]. moreover, superconformal covariance
requires that the shift-like transformations above do not reduce this number, so we must use all
the four components of the shift-invariant combinations (38) (notice that they have r-weight 1,
even though they are right-handed spinors). thus, we can write down the leading term in the
correlator in the following form:

h0p1p2p3p4i = 2

1232

124f p14|p24|p32|p42(x, u) + o(5 ) .

(42)

the coecient function f depends on the space-time and harmonic variables and carries u (1)
charges to match those of the correlator and of the nilpotent prefactor. in the present context

8

we are not interested in the purely conformal properties of this function, although it is easy to
see that it should depend on the conformally invariant cross-ratios of the xs (times a certain
prefactor which gives the nilpotent term in (42) the required dilation weight).

before going on we remark that the rest of the expansion (42) is completely determined by
superconformal covariance. indeed, in order to keep the required r-weight we have to expand
in pairs  . the shift-like transformations above do not mix  with . further, using the same
counting argument as before, we conclude that there exists no nilpotent invariant made out of
the four +s (chirality at point 0 prevents us from employing 0). so, all the higher-order terms
in (42) are uniquely related to the leading one by superconformal transformations.

besides superconformal covariance, the second main requirement on the correlator is h-analyticity
(34). since we have only written out the leading term in the  expansion (42), there is no need
to take into account the nilpotent part of the harmonic derivative (29) (it only contributes to
the next level in the expansion). then h-analyticity is reduced to a condition concerning the
pure harmonic dependence. the general solution of the h-analyticity condition on a harmonic
function of charge p is

d++f p(u) = 0  (cid:26) f p = 0 if p < 0;
i1 . . . u+
ip

f p = u+

f i1...ip

if p  0.

(43)

in other words, the solution only exists in the case of a non-negative charge and is a polynomial
of degree p in the harmonics u+. the coecient f i1...ip forms an irrep of su (2) of isospin p/2.
in our case, if we impose h-analyticity at a given point, the coecient f i1...ip can only be made
out of the harmonics at the remaining points, since no other object carries su (2) indices (we
have locked i
0 away in the combinations 0r). consequently, an h-analytic harmonic 4-point
function has the general form

(12)m12 (13)m13 (14)m14 (23)m23 (24)m24 (34)m34 , mrs  0 .

(44)

now, in our case we have to take account of the nilpotent prefactor in (42). it would be too
strong to demand that the function f be h-analytic with respect to all the variables. the point
is that the prefactor contains an overall factor (12)2 which can improve the behaviour of the
function f . indeed, the detailed expansion of the prefactor has the form, after some erzing,

2
1232
(12)2

124

= (34)22

12

2 + 2(23)(31)2

4(12) +

4
3

[(23)(14) + (13)(24)](12)(34)

+ all permutations

where r were dened in (39). then we can rewrite the expansion (42) as follows:

h0p1p2p3p4i =

1232
2
(12)2 f p12|p22|p32|p42(x, u) + o(5 ) .

124

(45)

(46)

since the expression (45) has no harmonic zeros, it cannot suppress any singularities in the new
coecient function f. so, we must require that f be h-analytic on its own,

d++

r f p12|p22|p32|p42 = 0 ,

r = 1, . . . , 4 .

(47)

we have already seen that the general solution of such a condition, if it exists, is of the form
(44) where the total charges at each point should match those of f. thus we obtain the set of
equations

pr  2 = xs6=r

mrs ,

r = 1, . . . , 4

(48)

with mrs = msr.

the reason why eqs. (48) do not always have a solution is that we are looking for mrs which
are non-negative integers. this puts constraints on the allowed values of the correlators charges
p1, . . . , p4. an obvious restriction is that the sum of all charges must be even. further, it is easy
to see that charges such that, e.g.,

are ruled out. a special case are the extremal correlators of references [1, 3] for which, e.g.,

p4 > p1 + p2 + p3  4

(49)

we also see that no solution exists in the subextremal case

p4 = p1 + p2 + p3 .

p4 = p1 + p2 + p3  2 .

(50)

(51)

finally, we recall that the 4 + 1-point correlators of the type considered here are uniquely
determined by the leading term in their  expansion. therefore the constraints we have found
apply to the entire supereld correlation function h0p1p2p3p4i, and, by means of the reduction
formula (32), to the n = 2 matter correlators hp1p2p3p4i. the conclusion is that neither the
extremal nor the subextremal four-point correlators receive any quantum corrections beyond
tree level. it should be mentioned that the method explained in section 2 leads to a slightly
weaker condition on the coecient functions of the subextremal correlators. it takes the form of
a second-order pde in the space-time variables which requires boundary conditions in order to
x the solution. in this context one might speculate that the reduction formula automatically
takes account of some additional eld-theory input which is harder to formulate in an approach
based on symmetries alone.

to summarise, we have seen that the simple expressions for extremal correlators which were
derived in ads supergravity in [1] can be easily understood on the eld theory side as a conse-
quence of analyticity in the harmonic superspace formalism. furthermore, non-perturbative non-
renormalisation theorems can be proven subject to the assumption that there are no unsuspected
contact terms of the type which could interfere with the application of the reduction formula
[17]. strong arguments in favour of this assumption have been given in [16], including an explicit
verication of the reduction formula at two loops in the symmetric case p1 = . . . = p4 = 2.

we would also like to emphasise that these results hold for analytic correlators in any n = 2
scft and not just n = 4, and for any choice of the gauge group. we further believe that these
results can be extended to extremal correlators with an arbitrary number of points, although a
complete proof would require a more detailed study of nilpotent covariants. this topic is under
investigation.
