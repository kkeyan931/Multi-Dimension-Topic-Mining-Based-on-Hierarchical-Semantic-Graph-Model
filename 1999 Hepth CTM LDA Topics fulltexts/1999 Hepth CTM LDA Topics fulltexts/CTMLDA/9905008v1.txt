by the lorentz- and cpt- violating axial-vector term

their scheme jk found that

and concluded that the existence of cs term depends on
the choice of regularization procedure. the calculations
in2 also showed that the relation between k and b has
a renormalization ambiguity. this means that the re-
sult for k depends on physics beyond the cut-o.

here we provide an example of the fermionic system,
in which such cs term is unambiguously induced by
fermions. in this system the lorentz and gauge invari-
ances both are violated at high energy, but the behavior
of the system beyond the cut-o is known. this allows
the calculation of cs term in dierent physical situations.
the inuence of this cs term on the dynamics of the ef-
fective gauge eld has been experimentally observed.

this is the superuid 3he-a, where the low-energy
fermions, which are close to the gap nodes, are chiral
and relativistic. in the low-energy corner the dirac la-
grangian for them is that, discussed by jk, but with mass
m = 0. the b-vector in 3he-a is produced by the ow
of the superuid component of 3he-a with respect to the
normal component (thermal fermions): b = (b0, 0, 0, 0),
b0 = pfl0  (vs  vn). here pf is the fermi momentum;
l0 is the background homogeneous orientation of the unit
vector l which determines the position of two gap nodes.
the space and time dependent deviation of gap nodes
from their equilibrium positions enters the dirac equa-
tion as the vector potential of the electromagnetic eld
a = pf l (see e.g.3). an explicit form of the cs term3

gives the well determined connection between k0 and b0:
k0 = b0/22. this is dierent from eq.(1), probably be-
cause our massless case corresponds to m/b0  0 instead
of the limit b0/m  0 in1.

in case of massless fermions the parameter b0 plays
the part of the chemical potential r for the right-handed
fermions and, with the minus sign, the chemical potential
l for the left-handed fermions. then with substitution

the eq.(2) coincides with the cs term calculated in4. the
cs term triggers the instability of the excess of the chiral
charge towards the production of the magnetic eld. this
was used by joyce and shaposhnikov5 in their scenario
for nucleation of the primordial magnetic eld. in 3he-a
this is a well known helical instability instability6. the
conversion of the counterow (r) to the inhomogeneous
l-eld (fik) due to this instability has been observed in
rotating vessel7,3.

in 3he-a there are also subtle points related to gauge
invariance of the cs term, as discussed by coleman and
glashow8, and to reference frame. they are however
determined by physical situations.

(i) the reference frame for superuid velocity vs is the
heat bath frame  the frame of the normal component
moving with velocity vn. at t = 0 this frame disappears:
thermal fermions are frozen out. to avoid uncertainty in
vs  vn, we assumed that t is small but nite.

(ii) in the eective electrodynamics of 3he-a the
gauge invariance takes place only in the low-energy cor-
ner. the eq.(2) in the low-energy action is gauge in-
variant if the b0 parameter (or r) is constant, i.e.
if
the background superow and l0 eld are homogeneous.
this is in agreement with the conclusion made in ref.1,
that for existence of the cs term the weak condition 
the gauge invariance at zero 4-momentum  is required.
