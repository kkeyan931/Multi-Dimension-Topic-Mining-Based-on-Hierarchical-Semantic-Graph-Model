duality in the integrable systems arising in the context of seiberg-witten theory shows that
their tau-functions indeed can be seen as generating functions for the mutually poisson-commuting
hamiltonians of the dual systems. we demonstrate that the -function coecients of their expansion
can be expressed entirely in terms of the co-ordinates of the seiberg-witten integrable system, being,
thus, some set of hamiltonians for a dual system.

1 introduction

it has become clear recently that rather simple and well-known nite-dimensional integrable hamiltonian systems
play an important role in the formulation of eective action for low-dimensional susy string and yang-mills
theories [1] (see also [2] and list of references therein). remarkably enough, the nonlinear dynamics arises on
moduli spaces of vacuum expectation values of scalar elds and wilson loops of gauge elds, which play the
role of dynamical variables (co-ordinates, momenta and action-angle variables) of an integrable system, which
usually belongs to a relatively wide class of (complexied) systems of particles of toda, calogero-moser and
ruijsenaars-schneider type (the most recent classication of the seiberg-witten [4, 5] integrable systems can
be found in [3]).

speaking about this family of integrable models, seiberg-witten theory, on one hand, explains the physical
origin of relativization of integrable systems of particles in spirit of s.ruijsenaars  the contribution of the
kaluza-klein sector in theories with extra compact dimensions [6]. on the other hand, it considers co-ordinates
and momenta on equal footing with the action-angle variables [7]  as moduli in compactied theory [8]. the
general picture of the seiberg-witten theory from this perspective and general ideology of duality in modern
string or m-theory leads to expecting of some duality relations between co-ordinates and momenta on one side
and action-angle variables on another one. it is not a coincidence thus, that such duality was found to act
naturally on the phase spaces of calogero-moser models and their compact ruijsenaars-schneider relatives
[9, 10] (the toda chain systems arise as a special double-scaling degenerate case [11]).

this duality can be considered as a way of constructing new nontrivial completely integrable systems with
very nontrivial properties. for example, it may lead to the systems where the hamiltonians depend on momenta
(or on both momenta and co-ordinates) through the elliptic double-periodic functions (next step after the
ruijsenaars relativization when hamiltonians depend on momenta via trigonometric functions), an example
of such double-elliptic system was proposed in [10]. it was also conjectured in [10] that the tau-functions of
the seiberg-witten nite gap integrable systems (expressed through theta functions on corresponding seiberg-
witten curves with specic period matrices  the set of couplings in low-energy eective susy gauge theories)
may play a role of generating functions for the hamiltonians of the dual systems. recently this conjecture was
checked for the perturbative or instanton expansions by numeric maple computations [12]. below in
this note we will demonstrate that mutual poisson commutativity of hamiltonians follows directly from duality
arguments  the -coecients of the expansion of generating function are functions only of co-ordinates (or
dual action variables) of the original seiberg-witten integrable system, or the function of moduli entering the
superpotential of compactied theory [8, 13, 14, 7].

2 duality in integrable systems

by duality for a system of free particle one usually means the fourier transform, or exchange between co-
ordinates and momenta, which are the integrals of motion themselves in free case. one may think of an
exchange between the co-ordinates and action variables as of a natural generalization of the fourier transform
for a nontrivial or interacting dynamical system, if it is completely integrable, since both set of quantities look
similar from the hamiltonian point of view  i.e. mutually poisson commute. following [9, 10], by dual systems
we call integrable systems living on the same phase space, with the same symplectic form

 = dq  dp = da  dz

(1)

but with two dierent set of integrals of motion (action variables or hamiltonians which are the functions of
each other)  for the rst (the seiberg-witten) system the hamiltonians are {hi(q, p)} (or action variables
{ai(q, p)}, hi = hi(a))  some nontrivial functions of co-ordinates and momenta, while for the dual system the
role of action variables (or hamiltonians) is played by the original co-ordinates (or some algebraically independent
functions of them) {qi(a, z)}. both sets mutually poisson commute

{qi, qj} = 0

{ai, aj} = 0

(2)

i, j = 1, . . . , 1

2 dim(phase space), with respect to the poisson bracket inverse to (1).

for arbitrary integrable systems this very general property (dened already at the level of the liouville
theorem) does not lead necessarily to any interesting consequences. however, the seiberg-witten integrable
systems possess very peculiar properties with respect to the duality transformation q  a. in the perturbative
(weak coupling) limit, seiberg-witten models with the adjoint matter are described by trigonometric calogero
and ruijsenaars models, the family of which is self-dual with respect to duality transformation [9], i.e. the
functions ak = fk(q, p) and qk = fk(a, z), expressing the action variables via co-ordinates and momenta and
the functions expressing new actions (old co-ordinates) via new co-ordinates and momenta (old action
the duality transformation is symmetric. this is literally true for the
and angle variables) coincide, i.e.
sinh2 q and
q2  in the simplest case  respectively; one may easily chack this solving directly equations of motion

trigonometric ruijsenaars and rational calogero models (with the hamiltonians h = 2 cosh pq1 + m2

h = p2 + m2
in one-particle case) while the trigonometric calogero model is dual to the rational ruijsenaars.

this family of integrable models is nothing but a perturbative degeneration of the nite-gap or hitchin

integrable systems corresponding to the seiberg-witten curves  of the lax form

det(  l(z)) = 0

(3)

where the lax operator l(z) is dened on some base curve 0  below (and usually) torus (elliptic) or sphere
with punctures (rational)  with generating dierential

the action variables are given by the seiberg-witten contour integrals over half of the independent contours

ds = dz

modulids = holomorphic

(4)

or

and the symplectic form is [15, 16, 17]

a =ia
ad =ib

ds

ds

 = ds| = da  dz() = dq  dp

(5)

(6)

(7)

where the variation of dierential (4) is computed in the divisor  of the poles of the baker-akhiezer function.

in the perturbative limit the curve (3) becomes rational, what corresponds to the solitonic limit of a nite-gap
system. then dependence on base curve (on spectral parameter z) eectively disappears and eq. (3) becomes
a generating function for the hamiltonians of (perturbative) seiberg-witten integrable system  invariant com-
binations of matrix elements of l

det(  l) =x khk

2

(8)

on the other hand, the determinant in (8) looks very similar to the solitonic or wronskian tau-functions for the
solutions to kp or toda lattice hierarchies, if the spectral parameter  would play the role of main (rst in kp
case or zero in toda) time  always a parameter on base curve. this way the particular analytic representation
of the seiberg-witten curve could be thought of as a tau-function for a dual integrable system, or, better, of a
solution to kp or toda lattice hierarchy associated with a dual system in the sense of [18, 19, 20]  when the
zeroes of tau function of kp/toda hierarchy become co-ordinates of some integrable system of particles. the
discussion of the parallels between tau-functions and spectral curve equations (3) is beyond the scope of this
note, it only helps now to state that it could be natural to look for the generation function of dual mutually
poisson-commuting hamiltonians in terms of tau-functions of the seiberg-witten nite gap solutions  the theta
functions on seiberg-witten spectral curves.

3 generating function

let us turn now directly to the generating functions [10] to be discussed below. we will consider the situation
when the spectral curve (3) covers 1-dimensional complex torus, or its degeneration  a cylinder or sphere with
two punctures. the last case corresponds, among others, to the periodic toda chain or pure glyodynamics
while the rst case contains the elliptic calogero-moser and ruijsenaars-schneider models, corresponding to
the seiberg-witten theories with adjoint matter.

for a dual system.

3.1 toda chain

consider, rst, a degenerate case of the periodic toda chain with the base curve 0 being a cylinder. if one
substitutes into (14) the period matrix of the genus g = n  1 periodic toda chain spectral curve (3)

3.2 calogero-moser model

in the calogero-moser case the commutativity of i can be shown in the following way. the (genus g = n )
spectral curve is given by

det

n n(cid:0)lcm (z)  (cid:1) = 0

lcm (z) = ph +x

f (q|z)e!

(q + z| )

(q| )(z| )

where (z) is odd jacobi theta-function, and

f (q|z) = m

ai =iai
i =ibi

so that eq. (13) can be considered literally. according to [19] equation

i, j = 1, . . . , n

0 = (z|t ) = xizzn

 i

n

(z|n  )i

(23)

(25)

as an equation on z-torus has exactly n zeroes 1

n

n

(n qj|n  )i = 0

j = 1, . . . , n

(26)

xi=1

the system should have nontrivial solutions, i.e. detij  i
of degrees of freedom from n to n  1. then (26) can be rewritten as

n

(n qj|n  ) = 0, which eectively reduces the number

i.e.

therefore, the ratios i

thus, obviously poisson commute n i

3.3 generalities

similar arguments can be applied in the relativistic case of the elliptic ruijsenaars-schneider model. the
spectral curve  is again dened over elliptic base 0 (see, for example, [3] and references therein for details)
and one can study zeroes of, now, toda lattice tau-function in double-periodic variable  the zero (or discrete)
time [20]. the formulas of the previous section are generalized straightforwardly.

the situation is not so simple with hypothetic double-elliptic system for the general case of n degrees of
freedom. the only known example exists for the n = 1 case [10] and it is self-dual with respect to q  a
exchange. there is no clear way yet to write down any reasonable lax representation or spectral curve equation,
(i) with ds = d log w and is a

except for the perturbative case, when it can be identied with w = w0  q (i)

degenerate case of the xy z spin chain [24]. this problem deserves further investigation.

4 discussion

in this note we have discussed the conjecture of [10] that tau-functions of the seiberg-witten integrable systems
can play a role of generating functions for new commuting hamiltonians. as a result it is demonstrated above,
that the arising quantities  the ratios of coecients of decomposition over base curve are indeed poisson-
commuting quantities  the (functions of) hamiltonians of dual integrable systems or, in other words, the can
be expressed via only the co-ordinates of the original integrable system.

being an interesting academic question from the internal point of view of the theory of integrable systems,
it is also related to more physical issues of the seiberg-witten theory. co-ordinates and momenta of integrable
system play the role of bare moduli in seiberg-witten theory so that the co-ordinates are the variables associated
with superpotential in compactied theory with partially broken supersymmetry. it would be interesting to
understand the role of generating function and {i} from general point of view of geometric description of the
seiberg-witten m-theory vacua. we hope to return to this problems elsewhere.
