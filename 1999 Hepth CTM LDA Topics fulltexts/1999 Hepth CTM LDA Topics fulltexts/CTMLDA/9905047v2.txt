fermion masses in noncommutative geometry

recent indications of neutrino oscillations raise the question of the possibility of incorporating
massive neutrinos in the formulation of the standard model (sm) within noncommutative geometry
(ncg). we nd that the ncg requirement of poincare duality constrains the numbers of massless
quarks and neutrinos to be unequal unless new fermions are introduced. possible scenarios in which
this constraint is satised are discussed.

i. introduction

ii. noncommutative geometry

the results of recent solar, atmospheric, and accelera-
tor-based neutrino experiments all suggest that neutrino
oscillations do occur [1]. this leads one to the idea that,
as in the case for quarks, the neutrino avor eigenstates
are coherent linear superpositions of mass eigenstates.
for a neutrino of avor  we have

|i =

n

xi=1

ui|ii ,

(1)

where ui is the leptonic mixing matrix. a straightfor-
ward quantum mechanical calculation leads to the follow-
ing expression [2] for the probablility that a neutrino of
avor  with a momentum p will oscillate into a neutrino
of avor  in a distance l:

where mi is the mass of the ith mass eigenstate.

in the usual sm, neutrinos are taken to be massless;
experiments have only given upper bounds on the masses.
however, nothing forces neutrinos to be massless, and if
one takes the oscillation experiments seriously, then the
analysis above shows that neutrinos must have mass. the
simplest way to modify the sm to accomodate massive
neutrinos is by including r states and yukawa couplings
for the neutrinos (which would involve the leptonic mix-
ing matrix ui above).

it has been shown that, while a ncg version of the
sm is possible, there are many yang-mills-higgs models
which cannot be formulated within the ncg framework
[3]. in this article we address the question of the extent to
which the ncg formulation of the sm allows for massive
neutrinos. this question has been addressed for an earlier
ncg version of the sm [4]. here we reconsider the issue
in the context of the requirement of poincare duality.

1

we begin with a brief overview of the main ideas of
ncg a la connes as they pertain to models of particle
physics. we refer to [5] for a clear and thorough review
of ncg as it is applied to the sm.

the basic data required to specify a ncg are grouped
together in a package called a real spectral triple [6]. a
spectral triple (a, h, d) consists of a hilbert space h on
which the involutive algebra a is represented as a sub-
algebra of b(h), together with a self-adjoint operator
d. the operator d need not be bounded, but we re-
quire that [d, a] be bounded for all a  a and that the
resolvent (d  )1,  / r of d is compact.
if there
exists an operator  on h which satises  = , 2 = 1,
d = d, and a = a for all a  a, then we classify
(a, h, d) as a even spectral triple. a real spectral triple
is an even spectral triple for which there also exists an
antilinear isometry j which satises jd = dj, j 2 = ,
j = j, where  and  take values in {+1, 1} de-
pending on the dimension of the spectral triple. we also
require that both [a, jbj ] and [[d, a], jbj ] vanish for
all a, b  a.

the ncg particle physics models which have been con-
structed thus far all make use of the notion of the product
of real spectral triples. one factor of the product encodes
the spacetime of the model and the other factor encodes
the internal space (the gauge group). for the standard
model the components of the spectral triple are

a = as  af = c(r4, r)  (c  h  m3(c)) ,
h = l2(r4, s)  hf ,
d = 6   1  5  df ,
 = 5  f ,
j = c  jf .

(3)

(7)

where hf is a complex hilbert space which has a basis
labeled by the elementary fermions (including antiparti-
cles), df contains the yukawa couplings, f is the grad-
ing by chirality on hf, c is the charge conjugation op-
erator on spinors, and jf is the charge conjugation on
hf.

iii. poincar e duality

in classical dierential geometry, poincare duality is
the requirement that for p-forms  and  the scalar prod-

the poincare duality condition is rooted in k-theory.
for a zero-dimensional spectral triple the condition
amounts to the nondegeneracy of the intersection form

vanishes for all  only if  = 0. connes has put forth
seven axioms dening ncgs [7] of which riemannian ge-
ometries are then seen as special cases. the application
of connes generalization of the poincare duality con-
dition to zero-dimensional spectral triples (ones based
on matrix algebras) is nicely explained in [5]. here we
generalize the ncg formulation of the sm to allow for
both right-handed neutrinos and charge-2/3 quarks with-
out right-handed states and derive the implications of
poincare duality in this setting.

our rst step is to adjust the representation of the
algebra af = c  h  m3(c). denote an element of
af by the triple (, q, m), where   c, q  h, and
m  m3(c). recall also that a quaternion may be ex-
pressed as q =  + j, where ,   c. for n1 gen-
erations of leptons without right-handed neutrinos, the
representation on the particle space is

+
1(, q) =

r r

 1ln1 .

(9)

in the remaining n  n1 generations we include right-
handed neutrinos, thus the appropriate representation is

r r

 1ln n1 .

(10)

in the above,  denotes e, , or  , not the weak doublets.
for the quarks, the representations are the same except
that we replace n1 by n2, the number of generations for
which the charge-2/3 quark has no right-handed state,
and tensor each of the above by 1l3 for color. we must
also give the representations of (, q, m) on the antiparti-
cles, which are simply multiplication by  for the leptons
and multiplication by m for the quarks.

the total hilbert space of the theory is h = (h+
q )  (h

q ) where

  h

for the leptons and

qij = (pi, pj) = tr(pijpjj ) ,

(13)

where  is the chirality operator, j, the charge conjuga-
tion operator, is the real structure on the spectral triple,
and the pi s are generators of k0(a). for the nite part
of the algebra we are using, k0(af) = z  z  z. this
group is generated by the minimal-rank projections 1 for
c, 1l2 for h, and e = diag(1, 0, 0) for m3(c).

for our calculations we choose the same basis as in [5],
in which p1 = (1) e, p2 = 1  1l2, and p3 = 1. in terms
n1 and n2 dened above, the chirality and projections
take the form

 7 (1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1

(1, 0, 1, 1)3n2  (1, 1, 1, 1)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(1, 0, 1, 1)3n2  (1, 1, 1, 1)3(n n2) ,

(14)

p1 7 (1, 0, 0, 0)n1  (1, 1, 0, 0)n n1

(1, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (1, 1, 0, 0)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(e, 03, e, e)n2  (e, e, e, e)n n2 ,

(15)

p2 7 (1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1

(1, 0, 1, 1)3n2  (1, 1, 1, 1)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(0, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (0, 0, 0, 0)3(n n2) ,

p3 7 (1, 0, 0, 0)n1  (1, 1, 0, 0)n n1

(1, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (1, 1, 0, 0)3(n n2)
(1, 0, 1, 1)n1  (1, 1, 1, 1)n n1
(0, 0, 0, 0)3n2  (0, 0, 0, 0)3(n n2) .

(16)

(17)

these projections can be read o from the representa-
tions given above, taking (, q, m) to be (1, 0, e) for p1,
(1, 1l2, 0) for p2, and (1, 0, 0) for p3.

for the nite part of the algebra, jf acts by

jf(cid:18) 

(cid:19) =(cid:18) 

(cid:19) ,

(18)

where (, )  h+  h. the eect on pi of conjugation
by jf is therefore to interchange the rst four terms in
the direct sum with the last four terms. using these

projections, we nd the intersection form q, omitting an
overall factor of 2, to be

n1  n2
n  n1 + 1
n  n1 + 1

2 n2
2 n2




n  n1 + 1

2 n2 n  n1 + 1
n1  n
n1  2n

2 n2

n1

n1  n


 .

(19)

first of all, we note that for n1 = n neutrinos without
right-handed states and n2 = 0 quarks lacking right-
handed states, as is the case in the sm, we get

q = 2n  1

0
0 1 0
0

1! ,

0

0

(20)

which agrees with the result of [6]. the determinant of
this matrix is 8n 3, so it is invertible and poincare duality
condition is satised.

if we keep right-handed states for all quarks (again,
n2 = 0) and let n1 = 0 so as to build an extension of the
sm in which all neutrinos are massive, the intersection
form is

q = 2n  0 1 1

1

2 ! ,

(21)

recovering the result of testard, as published in [5].
here the determinant of q vanishes, indicating that the
poincare duality condition is not satised in this case.

in the general case we nd that det q = 8(n1 n2)n 2.
the requirement that q be nondegenerate necessitates
that the determinant not vanish. thus, we must have
n1 6= n2.

iv. possible solutions

there are three ways to satisfy this constraint while in-
corporating massive neutrinos: (1) keep all of the right-
handed quark states (n2 = 0) and let one of the neutri-
nos (presumably e) remain massless (n1 = 1); (2) give
right-handed states to all of the neutrinos (n1 = 0) and
let the up quark remain massless (so that n2 = 1); (3)
give masses to all quarks and leptons (n1 = n2 = 0)
and introduce new fermions (perhaps a sterile neutrino).
we now explore these possibilities.

1. no massless quarks, one massless neutrino. the
conventional wisdom with regard to neutrino oscillations
is that neutrino masses are necessary in order for them
to occur. in the standard analysis given in the introduc-
tion, though, only mass dierences play a role, allowing
for the possibility of oscillations between massless and
massive neutrinos. many more sophisticated treatments
of neutrino oscillations have been carried out (see the ref-
erences in [8]), but it seems that in general they do not
rely on neutrino masses, but mass dierences to generate
oscillations.

with this in mind, we consider a case in which the
eigenvalue of the rst of the three mass eigenstates is
in this case there are three mass-squared dier-
zero.
ences, m2

m2
ij = m2
j , where mi is the eigenvalue of the ith
mass eigenstate), leaving two independent masses. set-
ting m1 = 0 xes the overall scale of the masses, but still
leaves two independent parameters. by adjusting m2 and
m3 we can account for two dierent oscillation lengths;
just as is the case were we to add neutrino masses to the
sm apart from the ncg context. with just two mass
scales, we cannot explain the results of all three types
of neutrino oscillation experiments mentioned in the in-
troduction, but we reserve judgement on this possibility
until more experimental verication is available.

2. one massless quark, no massless neutrinos. our
analysis has shown that poincare duality requires that
n1 6= n2, so we may take all neutrinos to be massive
if we are willing to take mu = 0 (in disagreement with
the claim of [5] that the mu = 0 possibility is excluded).
there has been quite a bit of discussion in the literature
regarding the mass of the u-quark and the possibility of it
vanishing (e.g. [911]). it seems that there is currently no
phenomenological result which necessarily excludes the
possibility of mu = 0.

for us, though, the masslessness of the u-quark comes
from the absence of the right-handed component, not
simply from the vanishing of the appropriate yukawa
coupling. this poses a problem for strong interation phe-
nomenology, since it forces the couplings to right-handed
and left-handed quarks to be dierent and would thus
lead to parity violation in the strong interactions.

3. new fermions.

if we take all of the neutrino ex-
periments seriously, not even three massive neutrinos are
enough to explain via oscillations all of the observed ef-
fects [1]. one possible solution is then to include a new
neutrino in the model. this option is severely limited
by the experimental measurement of the z width, which
is consistent with 2.993  0.011 light (2m < mz) neu-
trino types [14]. we can avoid conict with this result,
though, by introducing a neutrino which does not couple
in the usual way to the weak gauge bosonsa type of
sterile neutrino, as was introduced in [15,16]. the ef-
fects of such an inclusion would depend on the details of
the model and the resulting modication to the matrix
q. it has been shown in [17] that the reality axiom of
ncg disallows the inclusion of majorana fermions, thus
excluding many of the sterile neutrino models which have
been studied. the inclusion of other fermions in general
could also provide a solution, depending on the represen-
tations in which they appear.

v. conclusion

in its ncg setting, the sm, while quite constrained
[18], does allow for certain extensions which include right-

handed neutrinos and therefore neutrino masses and os-
cillations. our analysis of the poincare duality condi-
tion has shown that, if we allow only the addition of
right-handed neutrinos, the number of quarks with right-
handed states must be dierent from the number of neu-
trinos with right-handed states.

while the option of having a quark without a right-
handed state may have been appealing from the point of
view of the strong cp problem, it runs into trouble with
regard to parity violation in the strong interactions. the
case in which two neutrinos are given right-handed states
allows for two independent oscillation lengths, based on
our argument that neutrino oscillations may occur be-
tween massive and massless eigenstates. the sterile neu-
trino solution is an interesting one which should be ex-
plored further in the context of ncg.

we should also mention the idea that the almost com-
mutative structure that we have used here, where the
noncommutativity only appears in the nite part of the
algebra, may have to be abandoned at energies near the
electroweak scale. then, if all three neutrinos are found
to be massive, the resulting violation of poincare dual-
ity could be viewed as a signal that the tensor product
structure of the spectral triple on which the current ncg
realization of the sm is based is a kind of low-energy limit
of a truly noncommutative spectral triple. in that case
the poincare duality condition would have to be reeval-
uated for the spectral triple from which the one we use
today descends.
