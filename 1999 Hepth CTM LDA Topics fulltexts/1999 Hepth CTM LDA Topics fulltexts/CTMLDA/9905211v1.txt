abstract

m/string theory on noncompact, negatively curved, cosets which generalize adsd+1 =
so(d, 2)/so(d, 1) is considered. holographic descriptions in terms of a conformal eld

theory on the boundary of the spacetime are proposed. examples include su (2, 1)/u (2),

which is a euclidean signature (4, 0) space with no supersymmetry, and so(2, 2)/so(2)

and so(3, 2)/so(3), which are lorentzian signature (4, 1) and (6, 1) spaces with eight

supersymmetries. qualitatively new features arise due to the degenerate nature of the

conformal boundary metric.

1. introduction

in maldacenas ads/cft duality [1], m/string theory on ads is equivalent to a eld

theory on the boundary of ads. this is a concrete example of the plausibly much more

general holographic principle [2-4]. the holographic description of ads gravity relies on

very special properties of ads, such as the fact that the ratio of the volume and surface area

approaches a constant at large radius. hence it is far from obvious how the holographic

principle can be concretely realized in a general setting. discussions of holography in

cosmology have appeared in [5], in at space in [6], and in negatively curved spaces other

than ads in [7-10].

in this paper we propose a holographic description of m/string theory in a fam-

ily of negatively curved symmetric spacetimes. adsd+1 can be represented as the
coset so(d, 2)/so(d, 1). we consider holography for other noncompact cosets4,
mainly su (2, 1)/u (2), which is a signature (4, 0) space with no supersymmetry, and

so(2, 2)/so(2) and so(3, 2)/so(3), which are signature (4, 1) and (6, 1) spaces with

eight supersymmetries. there are many other similar noncompact cosets. these spaces

have unusual features such as closed timelike curves but nevertheless provide an interesting

and challenging arena in which to expand our understanding of holography.

an important new feature is that the conformal boundary metric for these cosets has

zero eigenvalues. this feature also appears in the conformal boundary metric at null inn-

ity in minkowski space, and so may be pertinent in more physically interesting spacetimes.

despite the degeneracy of the conformal boundary metric there is a nondegenerate confor-

mal boundary measure. we argue that this is enough to enable us to dene the boundary

theory via its correlators. we nd that, as in ads, the bulk isometries become confor-

mal isometries of the boundary, and the boundary scalar operators and scalar correlation

functions transform accordingly. (similar results may hold for higher spin, but they are

not explicitly investigated here.) another generic feature, associated with the degeneracy

of the boundary metric, is the appearance of an innite-dimensional enlarged conformal

symmetry group, in some ways analogous to the enlargement of so(2, 2) to two copies of

the virasoro algebra on the boundary of ads3.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we consider m-theory on su (2, 1)/u (2)
s7. the geometry and symmetries of su (2, 1)/u (2) and its conformal boundary are de-
scribed. the boundary measure is conformally the standard round measure on s3, while

4 holography for the cases of vacua of the form ads  x, where x is a compact coset space,

has been studied in [11].

1

the conformal boundary metric has signature (+, 0, 0). the einstein-kahler deformations

are discussed, following [12,13]. the compactication is shown to be free of tachyonic in-

stabilities. a prescription is given, generalizing [1,14,15], for dening the correlators of the

boundary conformal eld theory as appropriately rescaled limits of bulk correlators. they

are seen to be nite despite the degeneracy of the boundary metric. two-point functions

are explicitly computed using the su (2, 1) conformal isometry group. section 3 concerns
iib string theory on so(2, 2)/so(2)s5 and also briey m-theory on so(3, 2)/so(3)s4.
these are both supersymmetric lorentzian signature spacetimes. in the former case we

propose that the appropriate boundary theory is a two-dimensional conformal eld theory.

in the nal section 4 we conjecture a dual description in terms of conformal eld theories

from branes on spacetimes with degenerate metrics. we also describe how solitons can

spontaneously break so(d, 2) conformal invariance down to a smaller subgroup, and sug-

gest that at the duals to such congurations may in some cases be interesting lorentzian

cosets.

2. m-theory on su (2, 1)/u (2)  s7

in this section we consider m-theory compactied on su (2, 1)/u (2)  s7 and its
holographic representation on the boundary of su (2, 1)/u (2). this is a euclidean space

with no supersymmetry, as can be easily seen from the absence of a candidate supergroup.

in subsection 2.1 we describe the bulk geometry of this space as well as the degenerate

conformal geometry of the boundary. relevant results relating the metric deformations to

boundary data [12,13] are recalled in subsection 2.2. in 2.3 the mass of a scalar eld is

related to the quadratic casimir of su (2, 1) and it is shown that there are no tachyonic

instabilities. in subsection 2.4 a modication of the ads/cft prescription is given for

constructing the scalar correlators of the conformal eld theory on the boundary as limits

of bulk correlators.

2.1. geometry of su (2, 1)/u (2) and its conformal boundary

the coset space h = su (2, 1)/u (2) is topologically the open ball in c2 with the

bergman metric

ds2 =

dz1dz1 + dz2dz2
1  z1 z1  z2 z2

+

1

(1  z1 z1  z2 z2)2 (z1dz1 + z2dz2)(z1dz1 + z2dz2),

(2.1)

2

where z1 z1 + z2 z2 < 1. this is a kahler metric with kahler potential

k =  1

2 ln(1  z1 z1  z2 z2).

under the change of coordinates

z1 = r cos


2

ei(+)/2,

z2 = r sin


2

ei()/2,

this metric takes the form

ds2 =

dr2

(1  r2)2 +

r2

4(1  r2)

where the left-invariant one-forms are

(2

1 + 2

2) +

r2

4(1  r2)2 2

3,

1 = cos d + sin  sin d,
2 =  sin d + cos  sin d,
3 = d + cos d.

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

in this metric r  [0, 1),   [0, ),   [0, 2), and   [0, 4). dening r = tanh y yields
yet another form of the metric,

ds2 = dy2 +

1
4

sinh2 y(2

1 + 2

2) +

1
4

sinh2 y cosh2 y2
3.

(2.6)

the geometry (2.1) has an su (2, 1) isometry group because the left action on the

su (2, 1) group manifold remains unbroken in the quotient by the right action of u (2).

this group is generated by the following eight killing vectors.

h1 = z1z1  z1z1 ,

l1 = z2z1  z1z2 ,
1z1 ,

l2 = z1  z1 z2z2  z2
l3 = z2  z1z2z1  z2

2z2 ,

h2 = z2z2  z2z2 ,
l1 = z2z1  z1z2 ,
l2 = z1  z1z2z2  z2
l3 = z2  z1 z2z1  z2

1z1 ,

2z2 .

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

the commutation relations between these generators are given in appendix a. so far the

structure of su (2, 1)/u (2) is qualitatively similar to euclidean ads4, which is the coset
so(4, 1)/so(4). however, the structure of the conformal boundary is quite dierent. the

conformal boundary metric is determined (up to conformal transformations) by rescaling

3

(2.6) by a singular function of y such that the induced metric at the boundary y =  is
nite. rescaling (2.6) by 64e4y yields the induced metric on a surface of constant y,

ds2 = 4e2y(1  e2y)2(2

1 + 2

2) + (1  e4y)22
3.

(2.11)

this is a squashed three-sphere. as the boundary is approached, the squashing becomes

more and more severe, until nally at the boundary it degenerates to

ds2 = 2

3 = (d + cos d)2.

(2.12)

this metric has signature (+, 0, 0).

degenerate conformal metrics have appeared in other contexts. for example, the
boundary of ads4  s7 is s3  s7, but after conformal rescaling, the metric on the s7
factor is degenerate, and one has an eectively three-dimensional metric. an analogous

interpretation of (2.12) as a metric on a one-dimensional space does not seem possible, since

the one-form 3 is not closed. another example is the conformal metric at null innity

of minkowski space, which has signature (0, +, +). this last example suggests that the

problem of degenerate boundary metrics may be relevant for at space holography.

since the metric (2.12) is degenerate, the associated measure on the boundary van-

ishes. it is nevertheless possible to dene a conformal measure on the boundary. rescaling
(2.6) by 214/3e8y/3, one nds the nite induced volume form at the boundary

and associated measure

3 = 1  2  3,

d3 = sin ddd.

(2.13)

(2.14)

global scale transformations in the boundary theory are induced by shifts of y. since
dierent powers of ey are required to make the induced measure and metric nite, their

scaling dimensions will not be related by the usual factor of 2/3 (in three dimensions).

rather the scale transformations are

ds2
3  2(x)ds2
3,
3  2(x)3,

(2.15)

where x is a coordinate on the s3 boundary.

4

despite the degeneracy of the metric, the conformal killing equation

lgab = f (x)gab,

(2.16)

which does not involve the inverse metric, is well-dened. conformal killing vectors on the

boundary with an su(2, 1) lie bracket algebra are obtained by restrictions of (2.7)(2.10),

namely

l1 = ei( +

i

sin 

h1 = i( + ),
(  cos )),

h2 = i(  ),
i

l1 = ei( 
i

sin 

( + (1 + 2 cos2

(2.17)

(2.18)

(  cos )),

))),

(2.19)

l2 = ei(+)/2(sin

2

l2 = ei(+)/2(sin


2

 +

 

l3 = ei()/2(cos


2

 

2 cos 
2

l3 = ei()/2(cos

))),

(2.20)

))).

(2.21)

(  (1 + 2 sin2 
(  (1 + 2 sin2 

2

2

)))

(2.22)

(2.23)

one may check explicitly that the function f in (2.16) is

f (x) = mm.

f vanishes for (2.17)(2.18) which are the su (2)  u (1) isometries of the boundary. we
note that despite the degeneracy of the metric the covariant divergence is still well-dened.

when the metric is nondegenerate, one can easily show that the coecient on the right
hand side of (2.16) is always 2
d (in d dimensions) with f dened in (2.23), simply by
contraction with the inverse metric. however, the metric (2.12) does not have an inverse

so no such demonstration is possible, and we remarkably nd the same function with a

dierent coecient. these conformal killing vectors also preserve the measure

l3 = f (x)3.

(2.24)

here we encounter the standard conformal transformation law for a nondegenerate mea-

sure.

due to the degeneracy of the metric, there are innitely many conformal killing vectors

in addition to (2.17)(2.22), as detailed in appendix b. because they do not arise from

5

the isometries of the bulk, there is no reason to expect that they annihilate the vacuum

or provide simple relations among the correlators of the boundary theory. a somewhat
similar situation occurs in ads3, for which the bulk isometries are sl(2, r)sl(2, r), but
the conformal killing vectors of the boundary theory generate two copies of the virasoro

algebra. in that case the existence of the innite-dimensional virasoro algebra of course

has profound consequences for the boundary theory. we do not know if that is also the

case for su (2, 1)/u (2).

2.2. deformations

in this section we discuss deformations of the metric su (2, 1)/u (2) which preserve the

einstein equations but in general destroy the isometries. there is a well-developed theory

of such deformations. a key relevant result [12,13] is that for any strictly pseudoconvex
domain  in cn with a smooth boundary  there is a unique complete einstein-kahler
metric. the kahler potential is5

k =  1

2 ln s,

where s is a solution of feermans equation (slightly rewritten)

subject to the dirichlet boundary condition

(s)n+1 det ij ln s = 1

s| = 0.

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

this boundary condition ensures that the boundary points are an innite distance from

the interior.

the case of su (2, 1)/u (2) arises from the domain in c2 bounded by the s3 given by

v  1  |z1|2  |z2|2 = 0.

the solution of (2.26) is then simply

s = v.

(2.28)

(2.29)

it is easy to check that the resulting kahler metric is indeed the bergman metric (2.1).

a kahler-einstein deformation of the bergman metric can then be succinctly described

by deforming the equation for the boundary (2.28), for example by a polynomial in (z, z).

one can then nd s near the boundary in a power series expansion in v with a ln v term.

5 the factor of 1

2 , not present in [13], is inserted to conform to the conventions of this paper.

2.3. scalar elds and stability

consider a scalar eld  with mass m. the wave equation is

2  m2 = 0

where 2 is the laplacian for the metric (2.4),

2 = (1  r2)2 rr +

(1  r2)(3  r2)

r

r+

4(1  r2)

r2

( + cot  + csc2 (  2 cos  + (1  r2 sin2 )).

the quadratic casimir for su (2, 1) is

(2.30)

(2.31)

cii = 

1
2{l1, l1} +

1
2{l2, l2} +

1
2{l3, l3} + t 2 +

3
4

y 2,

(2.32)

where we redened y = h1  h2, t = (h2  h1)/2. using the vector elds (2.7)(2.10),
we nd that the laplacian is proportional to the casimir with a factor of 4. therefore

the solutions of the wave equation for a scalar eld of mass m form a representation of

su (2, 1) with quadratic casimir

cii =

m2
4

.

(2.33)

next we use the su(2, 1) algebra to classify the solutions of this equation. the represen-

tations were studied in [16]. the rank of su (2, 1) is two and highest-weight representations

are labelled by (t, y), such that

y |i = y|i,

t|i = t|i.

(2.34)

using the commutation relations [l1, l1] = 2t,
and the highest-weight conditions

[l2, l2] =  3

2 y +t,

[l3, l3] = 3

2 y t,

we obtain from (2.32) the equation

l1|i = l2|i = l3|i = 0,

cii|i = t2 + 2t +

3
4

y2|i.

or in terms of integers (p, q) such that t = 1

2 (p + q) and y = 1

3 (p  q),

m2 =

4
3

(p2 + q2 + pq) + 4(p + q).

7

(2.35)

(2.36)

(2.37)

for the scalar eld , the highest-weight conditions imply y = 0, or p = q and we obtain

the relation between the mass m of the scalar eld and the highest weight p of the form

m2 = 4p(p + 2).

(2.38)

the functional integral in the quantum theory includes all normalizable modes of ,

even if they do not solve the wave equation. these can be characterized as eigenmodes k
of the laplacian with eigenvalues k that obey

2k + m2k = kk.

(2.39)

if there is a negative eigenvalue k with normalizable eigenmode k, uctuations of k are
unstable. we wish to show that no such instabilities arise for m-theory on su (2, 1)/u (2)
s7. supersymmetry cannot be invoked since there are no appropriate covariantly constant

spinors in this geometry.

at large y, the angular part of the laplacian is exponentially suppressed, and k obeys

1
g

ygyk = e4yye4yyk = (m2  k)k,

using g  e4y. this implies that the leading asymptotic behavior of k is

k  e(2+4+m2k)y.

on the other hand, if k is normalizable we need

k  e2y

(2.40)

(2.41)

(2.42)

at innity. it is possible to satisfy (2.42) with negative k only if m2 < 4. 6 the spectrum
of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s7 has been studied in [17] and has been shown to
contain three families of scalars with masses m2 = 1
4 ((k +
3)29); and two families of pseudoscalars with masses m2 = 1
4 ((k+6)29); where
k = 1, 2, .. etc. (here we have shifted the mass and performed the overall normalization so
that conventions of [17] agree with those in [14]). the most negative mass2 is m2 =  9
4 ,
which is insucient to produce an instability.

4 ((k  3)2  9); 1

4 ((k + 8)2  9); 1

4 (k29); 1

6 we assumed here that, as is generically expected, the large y behavior is governed by the

dominant exponent (2.41); in principle the coecient of this term could vanish.

8

the theory also contains vector elds with linearized equations of motion

consider an ansatz

then (2.43) becomes

d  da = 0.

a = a(y)1.

(2
ya + 2ya)e2ydy23 + o(e2y)dy23 = 0.

(2.43)

(2.44)

(2.45)

this implies that the leading behavior of a is a constant, and that there is no normalizable
zero mode of the form (2.44). similar conclusions apply to a  2, while for a = a3
one nds a  ey, which is also non-normalizable. hence there are no normalizable zero
modes of this form. allowing for angular dependence of a, a negative eigenvalue for (2.43),
or considering massive vectors in the theory (which all have m2 > 0) only makes it more

dicult to get a normalizable eigenmode. in conclusion, the vector elds on su (2, 1)/u (2)

also do not induce an instability. we have also checked that normalizable graviton zero

modes do not exist, in harmony with the uniqueness theorem [13] discussed in section 2.2.
we conclude that su (2, 1)/u (2)  s7 is a stable solution of m-theory.

2.4. the boundary theory

in accord with the holographic principle, we wish to represent the bulk m-theory
on su (2, 1)/u (2)  s7 as a conformal eld theory on the conformal boundary of
su (2, 1)/u (2)  s7. in this subsection we describe (for scalars) how the operators and
correlation functions of this boundary theory can be dened as limits of various bulk

quantities. this procedure is a modication of that used to dene the boundary theory for
ads4  s7. the resulting correlators are well-behaved and transform appropriately under
the boundary conformal group su (2, 1), despite the degeneracy of the boundary metric.

in section 4 we discuss possible dual representations in terms of branes.

let us consider the conformal eld theory on the boundary of su (2, 1)/u (2)  s7

with the degenerate metric

and measure

ds2 = 2

3 = (d + cos d)2,

d3 = sin ddd.

9

(2.46)

(2.47)

a conformal transformation is a dieomorphism together with a weyl transformation. a

eld of conformal dimension  transforms as

o = (l +


3 mm)o,

(2.48)

where l is the usual lie derivative, equal to mm acting on scalars. the metric and
measure both have  = 3.

for simplicity let us restrict our attention to scalar operators o in the boundary. let
i, with i = 1, 2, . . . , 8, denote the eight su (2, 1) conformal transformations generated by
the vectors (2.17)(2.22) on s3. the quadratic casimir associated to such an operator

follows from squaring (2.48) as

ciio = gijijo =

4
9

(  3)o,

(2.49)

where gij is the at signature (4, 4) metric for the su(2, 1) lie algebra appearing in (2.32).

comparing (2.49) to (2.33) we see that for every scalar eld of mass m there is a boundary

operator with weight  obeying

m2 =

16
9

(  3).

(2.50)

the two-point function of the scalar elds ho1 (z)o2 (w)i is xed by the requirement
of invariance under conformal transformations. the requirement of invariance under the

isometries generated by (2.17)(2.18) leads to the following equations:

1

2

[h(z)
1 + h(w)
[h(z)
2 + h(w)
[l(z)
1 + l(w)
(z)

[ l1

+ l1

]ho1 (z)o2 (w)i = 0,
]ho1 (z)o2 (w)i = 0,
]ho1 (z)o2 (w)i = 0,
]ho1 (z)o2 (w)i = 0,

(2.51)

where the superscripts (z) and (w) on the generators denote the coordinates on s3. in
order to fully exploit the symmetries, the s3 coordinate z is traded for an su (2) group

element g dened by

gz = (cid:18) z1
z2

z2

z1(cid:19) = (cid:18) cos 
 sin 

2 ei(+)/2
2 ei()/2

sin 
cos 

2 ei()/2
2 ei(+)/2(cid:19) .

(2.52)

10

invariance under the su (2)  u (1) isometries generated by (2.51) then requires that the
correlators are invariant under a left su (2) action and a right u (1) action on g. this

requires that the correlator depends only on two real functions or one complex function u

ho1 (z)o2 (w)i = f (u, u),

where

u =

and u is the conjugate. the requirement for the two-point function to be covariant under
the transformation generated by l2 is

[l(z)
2 + l(w)

2

]ho1 (z)o2 (w)i = 

1

which can be rewritten in the form

f + (1  u )u f ) + w1(

f + (1  u ) u f ) = 0,

(2.56)

where  = 1 = 2. the condition that 1 = 2 follows from comparing equation (2.55)

with its conjugate. note that   l2  1g i(g li

2) = 2z1, where g  sin .

the other three equations have (z1, w1), (z2, w2) and (z2, w2) consecutively, in place

of (z1, w1). the function

f (u, u) = |1  u| 4

3

(2.57)

satises (2.56). since moreover each term in front of z1 and w1 vanishes separately, this
function satises evidently all the other equations. thus we have found that the two-point

function of two scalar elds of dimension  is given by

ho(z)o(w)i =

const
|1  u|

.

(2.58)

in the preceding we saw that conformal invariance determines the two-point func-

tions of the boundary operators. higher-point functions will not be fully determined by

conformal invariance. the recipe for calculating a general correlation function within the

11

ads/cft correspondence, as formulated in [14,15], is the following: rst, compute the

supergravity partition function in terms of the boundary values of the elds; then, identify

the operators in the boundary conformal eld theory whose sources are the given boundary

values; nally, interpret the supergravity partition function as a generating functional of

those operators. this prescription associates to each eld  in the supergravity action a
corresponding operator o by the relation
her

0oi = ei().

(2.59)

here i() is the classical action evaluated on the solutions of the supergravity equation

of motion subject to some boundary condition, the integral is over the boundary, and the

left hand side is interpreted as a partition function of the connected green functions for
the operators o. because of the boundary degeneracy, it is not manifestly obvious that
in this subsection we see that the
this prescription can be adapted to su (2, 1)/u (2).

divergences cancel and the prescription can indeed be adapted.

let us consider a scalar eld of mass m in the bulk of su (2, 1)/u (2). we will not keep

track of nite normalization constants in the rest of this section. in order to compute the
correlation function of the operators o, we rst have to calculate the action

i() = z drdddg(()2 + m22)

for a solution of a classical equation of motion

subject to the boundary condition

2 = m2,

(r, , , ) = (1  r2)2 2

3 0(, , ).

lim

(2.60)

(2.61)

(2.62)

we use the metric (2.4) in the bulk of su (2, 1)/u (2) and the relation between the mass
m of the scalar eld and the dimension  of the boundary operator, m2 = 16
9 (  3).
the solution of (2.61) is given by

we see that the boundary action is indeed a nite function of 0, despite the degeneracy
of the boundary metric, and that it correctly reproduces the two-point function of o as
determined by conformal invariance in the preceding subsection. in principle this boundary
action can also be used to determine the higher-point correlation functions of o and might
also be extended to elds of higher spin.

3. supersymmetric lorentzian cosets

in this section we consider compactications of iib on so(2, 2)/so(2)  s5 and m-
theory on so(3, 2)/so(3)  s4, where so(2, 2)/so(2)  w4,2 and so(3, 2)/so(3) 
w5,2 are the noncompact cousins of the stiefel manifolds so(4)/so(2)  v4,2 and
so(5)/so(3)  v5,2. each of these spaces is dened with the divisor subgroup em-
bedded canonically in the larger group. these examples dier from that of the previous

section in that they have lorentzian signature and are supersymmetric. the unbroken

supersymmetries are described in subsection 3.1. the geometry of w4,2 and its conformal
boundary are detailed in subsection 3.2. in 3.3 scalar elds in w4,2 are described.

3.1. supersymmetry

in this subsection it is shown that the spaces w5,2  s7 and w4,2  s5 preserve the
same amount of supersymmetry as ads4 v5,2 and ads5 v4,2, respectively, namely eight
supersymmetries in all cases.

on a space with nonvanishing cosmological constant, unbroken supersymmetries are

constructed from solutions of the killing spinor equation

dm = 0,

13

(3.1)

where dm = m  im. the integrability condition for this equation is that the operator
ab is the weyl tensor. hence we are
[dm, dn] = 1
interested in the holonomy of the weyl tensor.

abab has zero modes, where cmn

4 cmn

we rst recall that the weyl holonomy of v5,2 is su (3). following the conventions and
methodology of [18], dene (t ab)cd = a
c to be the generators of so(5), where
a, b, c, d range from 1 to 5. to make the canonical embedding of so(3) (~5  ~3 + ~1 + ~1)
manifest, rewrite the generators as

d  a

db

c b

x i =

1
2

ijkt jk, x m = t 4m, x m = t 5m, x 0 = t 45,

(3.2)

where x i generate the so(3) subgroup, and the indices i, m, m range from 1 to 3. the
values of the nonvanishing structure constants of so(5) (dened by [ta, tb] = cc
abtc)
are then

ck

ij = ijk, cn

im = c n

i m = imn, c n

(3.3)

(3.4)

the metric on g/h inherited from the group-invariant metric on g is not in general

an einstein metric, but can sometimes be transformed into an einstein metric without

losing any isometries by appropriately rescaling the vielbein components. consider the
matrices of structure constants (cd) a
b , as d runs over the indices in the normalizer of the
subgroup, and a and b run over at coset indices. it was shown in [18] that if these matrices
are block diagonal in the spaces spanned by the vielbein components ea1 , ea2 , . . . , then an
arbitrary rescaling of the vielbein, eai  r(ai)eai , preserves the original isometries. one
can try to nd a rescaling to obtain an einstein metric on the coset space. for v5,2, rescale
with r(m) = r( m) = 4 and r(0) = q 32
3 .

the riemann tensor for the rescaled coset can be calculated using the maurer-cartan

equations and the jacobi identities for the products of structure constants. in terms of the

structure constants and squashing parameters, the riemann tensor is

satises equations (3.8) with the weyl tensor of (3.7). thus, the holonomy of v5,2 is
su (3). the spinor ~8 of spin(7) decomposes as ~8 = ~1 + ~1 + ~3 + ~3 under su (3). the two

singlets account for two covariantly constant spinors on v5,2. the full symmetry group for
m-theory on ads4  v5,2 is osp(2, 2|2)  so(5), which has 8 supercharges.

similar arguments are valid for v4,2, obtained by the canonical embedding of so(2)
in so(4) : ~4  ~2 +~1 +~1. upon calculating the weyl tensor, one nds that the holonomy of
v4,2 is su (2). this eliminates half the supersymmetries, but, due to chirality constraints,
these can be used to construct only 8 supercharges for iib string theory on ads5  v4,2
[19]. the full symmetry group is su (2, 2|1)  so(4).

now consider w4,2 and w5,2. to obtain the generators of so(n  2, 2) from so(n),
simply multiply the generators x m and x m by i, so that only the structure constants

in (3.4) will change sign while those in (3.3) remain the same. note also that only the
00 component of the at metric changes sign. from (3.5), we nd that rab
cd(wn,2) =
rab
cd(vn,2). since the 0 components of the
weyl tensor all vanish according to (3.7), the at metric on the algebra generated by the

cd(wn,2) = cab

cd(vn,2). therefore, cab

weyl tensors of wn,2 and vn,2 are the same. hence the holonomies of w4,2 and w5,2 are
su (2) and su (3) respectively. the full symmetry groups of compactications iib|w4,2s 5
and m|w5,2s 4 are su (4|1) so(2, 2) and osp(4|2) so(3, 2) respectively, both of which
have 8 supercharges.

15

3.2. geometry of w4,2  so(2, 2)/so(2) and its boundary

the coset space obtained by quotienting so(2, 2) by the so(2) subgroup is a symmet-

ric einstein space with negative cosmological constant and signature (4, 1). topologically
w4,2 is s1  r4, so that 1(w4,2) = z.

the riemannian metric on w4,2 can be obtained by an analytic continuation of the

v4,2 metric and takes the form

ds2 =

(d+cosh y1d1+cosh y2d2)2+

2), (3.10)

where yi  [0, ), i  [0, 2), and   [0, 4). the coordinate  parametrizes the u (1)
ber of w4,2 viewed as a u (1) bundle over ads2  ads2. the isometries of this space are
generated by seven killing vectors

0 = ii ,

j = i

1 = ieii (coth yii

which generate an so(2, 2)  so(2) algebra (so(2, 2) = sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)):

[li

1, j] = [li

1, j] = 0,

where i = 1, 2.

the boundary of w4,2 might be dened by

sinh2 y1 + sinh2 y2 = 2  ,
which can be written in terms of a new coordinate   [0, 

2 ) as

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

sinh y1 =  cos ,

sinh y2 =  sin .

(3.14)

the conformal boundary metric is

ds2 = cos2 d2

1 + sin2 d2

2  4 cos  sin d1d2.

(3.15)

the u (1) ber parametrized by  has shrunk to zero size in the conformal metric (along
with the s5 which we have suppressed). the conformal killing vectors of the boundary,

16

which form an so(2, 2) algebra, are that subset of (3.11) that act nontrivially on the

boundary.

we have not succeeded in making sense of the notion of a theory on the boundary

(3.15).7 in most locations it is a degenerate signature (+, , 0) metric, but at  = 0, 
degenerates further to signature (+, 0, 0).

2 , it

an alternate procedure that yields a smoother result is to suppress the  coordinate.

a motivation for this is that distances in the  direction are all zero, together with those

along with the u (1) ber and the s5, in the conformal boundary metric. the variable 

is eliminated in the two-dimensional (rather than three-dimensional) boundary dened

by

sinh2 y1 = sinh2 y2 = 2  ,

which is simply t 2 with the conformal boundary metric

ds2 = du2

1  du2
2,

(3.16)

(3.17)

where u1 = 1  22 and u2 = 32. the so(2, 2) algebra on the boundary is generated

by the conformal killing vectors

li
0 = iui ,

li
1 = ieiui ui,

li
1 = ieiui ui .

this algebra can be extended to two copies of virasoro algebra with the generators

li
n = ieinui ui .

(3.18)

(3.19)

hence we may expect a two-dimensional conformal eld theory at the boundary.

a novel feature of this spacetime is the existence of closed timelike curves. examples

are the curves  = 

4 , 1 = 2, constant  and large y. unlike in ads4 these cannot be

eliminated by going to the covering space.

7 similar issues arise in other examples such as iib string theory on ads2  ads3  s 5.

17

3.3. scalar fields in w4,2

in this subsection we derive the relation between the mass m of the scalar eld in the

bulk and the highest weights j, h1, h2 of the so(2, 2)  so(2) algebra.

the scalar eld  in the bulk of so(2, 2)/so(2) is described by the wave equation

2 = m2,

where 2 is the laplacian for the metric (3.10),

2

2 = 3(

sinh2 y1

11 +

2 + 3
2 coth2 y1  2 coth2 y2 + 2 coth y1y1 + 2y1y1 + 2 coth y2y2 + 2y2y2 ).

22 

1 

sinh2 y2

2

4 coth y1

the laplacian can be written in terms of the casimir of so(2, 2)  so(2) as

2 = 6(

2

(

xi=1

j 2).

highest weight states |hi are characterized by

li
0|hi = hi|hi,

j|hi = j|hi,

li
1|hi = 0

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

acting with the casimir operator (3.22) on the highest weight state |hi leads to the relation

m2 = 6(h1(h1  1) + h2(h2  1)  j2/2)

(3.24)

hence for every scalar eld  of mass m we expect operators o in the boundary theory
with corresponding weights.

4. brane constructions

the holographic principle suggests that m/string theory on a given space can be

represented as a eld theory on the boundary of the space.

in the preceding section,

following the logic of the ads/cft correspondence, the boundary correlators for various

cosets have been described as limits of bulk correlators. in some of the ads cases, dual

description of the boundary theory for example as a large n gauge theory, are possible.

in this section such dual descriptions will be considered for the cases at hand.

18

the eld theory on the boundary of ads4  s7 can be dened as the infrared limit of
a theory of m2-branes, or the strong-coupling, infrared limit of the d2-brane gauge theory.
this theory lives on s3 with the round metric. one may consider the same limit on s3
with the squashed metric8

(2

1 + 2

2).

(4.1)

ds2 = 2

3 +

a

it is natural to conjecture that in the limit that the squashing parameter a is taken to
innity, one obtains the dual description of m-theory on su (2, 1)/u (2)  s7. (a simi-
lar conjecture was advanced in the context of taub-nut where a nitely squashed s3 is

encountered [8,9].) the results of section 2 can be regarded as evidence that this limit
is well-dened.9 similar conjectures for w4,2 and w5,2 involve yang-mills theory on a
degenerate four-geometry and the (0, 2) vebrane conformal eld theory on a degenerate

six-geometry. while perhaps plausible, these descriptions do not seem terribly useful in

their present formulation and are therefore unsatisfying.

it would be illuminating to nd these or other noncompact coset spaces as near-

horizon geometries of brane congurations. the branes may have nontrivial worldvolume

geometry and/or internal eld excitations. the spacetime supergravity solution for such

brane congurations is not in general known. however it may be possible in some cases with

enough symmetry to nd the near horizon geometry without knowing the full spacetime

solution. one construction that may lead to noncompact coset spacesalthough perhaps

not the ones explicitly discussed in this paperinvolves the spontaneous breakdown of

conformal invariance. this can occur in the presence of solitons. the generators of the

conformal group so(d, 2) of d-dimensional minkowski space are

va = xa + bax2  2xab  x,

together with the poincare generators. a scalar eld  for example transforms as

 = vaa +

d  2
2d

ava.

(4.2)

(4.3)

8 free eld theory partition functions on this space are computed in [20].
9 the scalar curvature of the metric (4.1) is r = 2

2a , and so is negative for the su (2, 1)/u (2)
(as well as taub-nut) boundary metric. this will lead to coulomb-branch instabilities near the
origin for the gauge theory scalars due to the r2 coupling. hence the ow into the infrared could

1

be quite nontrivial, and there may be subtleties concerning the order in which the infrared and

a  0 limit are taken.

19

a given expectation for  breaks the conformal group down to a subgroup generated by

those vs that annihilate  in (4.3). unbroken global scale invariance (generated by v = x)

requires

xaa = 

d  2

2

,

(4.4)

so  must scale in the specied way with x. in general this implies for d > 2 that  will be

singular at the origin. now consider the special conformal transformations parametrized
by the vector ba in (4.2). if  is invariant under some translations so that for longitudinal
transformations ba
la = 0, then (4.4) is necessary and sucient to ensure invariance
under the associated special conformal transformations. the transverse transformations
with ba

t a 6= 0 are necessarily broken.
in summary, if the eld conguration  scales as (4.4) and is invariant under d-

dimensional poincare transformations, it follows that the conformal group so(d, 2) is

broken down to so(d, 2). an obvious generalization of this statement pertains to the

brane worldvolume metric as well as higher-rank tensor elds. further conditions should

be imposed if supersymmetry is to be preserved.

in general, there are many noncompact cosets of which only three examples were

discussed in this paper. one obvious generalization is to quotient by both a left and a

right action. there are also many ways to spontaneously break conformal invariance with

solitons or nontrivial induced metrics on a brane worldvolume. it would be interesting to

nd a plausible candidate for a dual pair.
