abstract

we derive the power law decay, and asymptotic form, of su(2)spin(d) invariant
wavefunctions satisfying q = 0 for all sd = 2(d  1) supercharges of reduced
(d + 1)dimensional supersymmetric su(2) yang mills theory, resp. of the su(2)
matrix model related to supermembranes in d + 2 dimensions.

1

introduction

it is generally believed that supersymmetric su(n) matrix models in d = 9 dimensions
admit exactly one normalizable zero-energy solution for each n > 1, while they admit
none for all other dimensions for which the models can be formulated, i.e., for d = 2, 3, 5.
for various approaches to this problem see e.g. [1][13].

in this article, we would like to summarize (and slightly modify/extend) what is known
about the behaviour of su(2) zeroenergy solutions far out at innity in (and near) the
space of congurations where the bosonic potential (the trace of all commutatorsquares)
vanishes. based on some early negative result concerning n = 2, d = 2 (that used
rather dierent techniques/arguments; see [1, 18]) we started our investigation of the
asymptotic behaviour, in the fall of 1997, with a hamiltonian bornoppenheimer analysis
of that n = 2, d = 2 case. some months later, we realized that the rather complicated
hamiltonian analysis (halpern and schwartz [8] had, in the meantime, derived the form
of the wave function for d = 9 near , by hamiltonian bornoppenheimer methods) can
be replaced by a simple rst order analysis, using only the rst order operators q, and
rst order perturbation theory. one nds that asymptotically normalizable, su(2) and
so(d) invariant, wave functions do not exist for d = 2, 3, and 5, in contrast to d = 9,
where there is exactly one.

we close these introductory words by recalling that the models discussed below arise in
at least 3 somewhat dierent ways: as supersymmetric extensions of regulated membrane

1

theories in d + 2 spacetime dimensions [14, 18], as reductions (to 0 + 1 dimension) of d + 1
dimensional super yang mills theories [15][17], and, for d = 9, as a description of the
dynamics of d0 branes in superstring theory, [20, 21]. in this physical interpretation, the
existence of a normalizable zeroenergy solution is an important consistency requirement.
the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we recall the denition of the models,
and in section 3 we state our main result about zeromodes. the proof is given in section
4 and appendix 1. we suggest to skip subsection 4.5 and appendix 1 at a rst reading.
as a warmup the reader is advised to read appendix 2, where a simpler model is treated
by the same method.

2 the models

the conguration space of the bosonic degrees of freedom is x = r3d with coordinates

q = (~q1, . . . , ~qd) = (qsa)s=1,... ,d
a=1,2,3

.

to describe the fermionic degrees of freedom let, as a preliminary,

i = (i

),=1,... ,sd ,

(i = 1, . . . , d) ,

(1)

be the real representation of smallest dimension, called sd, of the cliord algebra with
d generators: {s, t} = 2st1i. on the representation space, spin(d) is realized through
matrices r  so(sd), so that we may view

spin(d)  so(sd) ,

(2)

as a simply connected subgroup. we recall that

sd =(2[d/2] ,

2[d/2]+1 ,

d = 0, 1, 2 mod 8 ,
otherwise ,

where [] denotes the integer part. we then consider the cliord algebra with sd generators
and its irreducible representation on c = c2sd/2. on c3 the cliord generators

(~1, . . . , ~sd) = (a)=1,... ,sd

a=1,2,3

are dened, satisfying {a, b} =  ab. the hilbert space, nally, is

h = l2(x,c3) .

(3)

there is a natural representation of su(2) spin(d)  (u, r) on h. in fact, the group
acts naturally on x through its representation so(3)  so(d) (which we also denote by
(u, r)). on c3 we have the representation r of spin(sd)  r

r(r)ar(r) = era ,

where er = er(r) is its so(sd) representation. through so(sd) = spin(sd)/z2 and (2) we

have

(4)

(5)

spin(d)  spin(sd) ,

2

and thus a representation r of spin(d). the representation u of su(2)  u on c3 is
characterized by u(u)au(u) = uabb.
we shall now restrict to d = 2, 3, 5, 9, where sd = 2, 4, 8, 16, the reason being that
in these cases

whereas sd is strictly larger otherwise. eq. (6) is essential for the algebra (7) below [17].

sd = 2(d  1) ,

(6)

the supercharges, acting on h, are given by the sd hermitian operators
( = 1, . . . , sd) ,

q = ~ (cid:0)it



~t +

(cid:1) ,

where st = (1/2)(st  ts). these supercharges transform as scalars under su(2)
transformations generated by

resp. as vectors in rsd under spin(d) transformation generated by

jst = i(~qs  ~t  ~qt  ~s)

which commutes with both jab and jst. the question we address is the possibility of a
normalizable state   h with zero energy, i.e., with h = 0, which is a singlet w.r.t.
both su(2) and spin(d). note that on su(2) invariant states h = 2q2
  0 and in fact
the energy spectrum is ([19]) (h) = [0,). equivalently, we look for zero-modes

q = 0 ,

( = 1, . . . , sd) .

3 results

the potentialps<t(~qs  ~qt)2 vanishes on the manifold
with r > 0 and ~e 2 = ps e2

~qs = r~ees

s = 1. the dimension of the manifold is 1 + 2 + (d  1) =
3d 2(d 1). points in a conical neighborhood of the manifold can be expressed in terms
of tubular (or endpoint) coordinates [23]

~qs = r~ees + r1/2~ys

(9)

with

~ys  ~e = 0 ,

~yses = ~0 .

(10)

a prefactor has been put explicitely in front of the transversal coordinates ~ys, so as to
anticipate the length scale r1/2 of the ground state. the change

(~e, e, y) 7 (~e,e, y)

(11)

does not aect ~qs. rather than identifying the two coordinates for ~qs, we shall look for
states which are even under the antipode map (11).

we can now describe the structure of a putative ground state.

theorem consider the equations q = 0 for a formal power series solution near r = 
of the form

 = r

r 3

2 kk ,

xk=0

(12)

where: k = k(~e, e, y) is square integrable w.r.t. de de dy;

k is su(2)  spin(d) invariant;
0 6= 0.

then, up to linear combinations,

 d=9: the solution is unique, and  = 6;
 d=5: there are three solutions with  = 1 and one with  = 3;
 d=3: there are two solutions with  = 0;
 d=2: there are no solutions.

all solutions are even under the antipode map (11),

except for the state d = 5,  = 3, which is odd.

k(~e, e, y) = k(~e,e, y) ,

remarks 1. the equation q = 0 can be viewed as an ordinary dierential equation
in z = r3/2 for a function taking values in l2(de de dy,c3) (see eq. (14) below). it turns
out that z =  is a singular point of the second kind [22]. in such a situation the series
(12) is typically asymptotic to a true solution, but not convergent.
2. the integration measure is dq = dr  r2de  rd1de  r 1
2 2(d1)dy = r2dr de de dy. the
wave function (12) is square integrable at innity ifr  dr r2(r)2 < , i.e., if  > 3/2.
the theorem is consistent with the statement according to which only for d = 9 a (unique)
normalizable ground state for (8) (which would have to be even) is possible.
3. note that the connection of matrix models with supergravity requires the zeroenergy
solutions to be spin(d) singlets only for d = 9.

the case d = 2 can be dealt with immediately. we may assume 2 = 3, 1 = 1

(pauli matrices), so that

m12 =

i
2

1a2a ,

4

with commuting terms. since, for each a = 1, 2, 3, (1a2a)2 = 1/4, we see that m12
has spectrum in z/2 + 1/4. given that l12 has spectrum z, no state with j12 = 0 is
possible. we mention [1] that, more generally, for d = 2 no normalizable su(2) invariant
ground state exists.

the proof of the theorem will thus deal with d = 9, 5, 3 only.

(17)

(with ~y restricted to (10)), where the fermionic states |f (e, ~e)i can be described as

5

~n  ~n = 0, ~n+  ~n = i~e ). for any vector v  rsd we may introduce ~(v) = ~v, as
well as fermionic operators ~(v)  ~n satisfying canonical anticommutation relations:

(cid:8)~(u)  ~n, ~(v)  ~n(cid:9) = 0 .

for

essv = v .

then, |f (e, ~e)i is required to obey

su(2)  spin(d) invariant states

4.2
we recall that the representation r[] of spin(d) on h is (r[r])(q) = r(r)((r1q)),
where r(r) acts on c3. similarly for su(2). the invariant solutions among (17) are
thus those which satisfy

u(u)|f (e, ~e)i = |f (e, u~e)i ,

r(r)|f (e, ~e)i = |f (re, ~e)i ,

(23)

for (u, r)  su(2)  spin(d). these states are in bijective correspondence to states
invariant under the little group (u, r)  u(1)  spin(d  1), i.e., to states |f (e, ~e)i
satisfying

u(u)|f (e, ~e)i = |f (e, ~e)i ,

r(r)|f (e, ~e)i = |f (e, ~e)i ,

(24)

6

for some arbitrary but xed (e, ~e) and all u, r with u~e = ~e, re = e. the rst relation
holds on all of (18). in fact the generator (22) of the group u(u) of rotations u about
~e annihilates |f (e, ~e)i, as we just saw. to discuss the second relation (24) we note that
the generators of spin(d  1) (i.e., of the fermionic rotations about e), are mstusvt with
uses = vses = 0. we write mst = m 

st, where

st + m k

st = (i/2)(~  ~n+)st
m 

(~  ~n) ,

m k
st = (i/4)(~  ~e )st

(~  ~e ) ,

(25)

and remark that, by a computation similar to (22), m 
st usvt annihilates |f (e, ~e)i. as a
result, we may study the representation r of the group spin(d1) through its embedding
in the cliord algebra generated by the ~  ~e.
the operators ~  ~e leave the space (18) invariant and act irreducibly on it. that
space is thus isomorphic to c, and spin(sd) acts according to (4) (with a replaced by
~  ~e). this representation decomposes (see e.g. [24]) as
c = (2(sd/2)1)+  (2(sd/2)1)

(26)

w.r.t. the subspaces where   2sd/2qsd

~~e = +1, resp. 1. the embedding (5) and
the corresponding branching of the representation (but not the statement of the theorem!)
depend on the choice of the matrices. in order to select a denite embedding, let

c2, the irreducible representation space of the complex cliord algebra with 3 genera-
tors. the real representation (27) is obtained by joining two complex representations,
followed by an appropriate change t of basis. the embedding (5) is thus realized through
r 7 t 1(r  1i2)t and the embedding su(2)c  so(4)c = su(2)c  su(2)c is equivalent
to u 7 (u, 0).

the further branching spin(d)  spin(d  1) yields

the content of invariant states stated in the theorem is now manifest. one should notice
that for d = 3 the little group u(1) is abelian and the singlets 11 do not correspond
to invariant states. for later use we also retain the fermionic spin(d) representation to
which the remaining singlets are associated,

44 (d = 9) ;

1, 1, 1, 5 (d = 5) ;

1, 1 (d = 3) ,

(30)

together with the corresponding eigenvalue of :

1, 1, 1, 1 (d = 5) ;

1,1

(d = 3) .

(31)

4.3 even states

it remains to check which of these states satisfy |f (e,~e)i = |f (e, ~e)i. let us begin
by noting that by (23)

|f (e,~e)i = eimab eaubeimstesut|f (e, ~e)i ,

where ~u  r3, resp. u  rd are unit vectors orthogonal to ~e, resp. e. the spin(d)
rotation can be factorized as eimstesut = eim 
|f (e, ~e)i = |f (e, ~e)i with

stesut. we claim that eim k

stesuteim k

stesut

 = 1

(d = 9) ;

1, 1, 1,1 (d = 5) ;

1, 1 (d = 3) .

(32)

the operator represents a rotation r  spin(d) with re = e in the representation
(30). for d = 9 the latter can be realized on symmetric traceless tensors tij, (i, j =
1, . . . , 9), where the spin(8)singlet is eiej  (1/9)ij, implying  = 1. for d = 5,
the last representation (30) is just the vector representation, where  = 1. as the
remaining cases are evident, eq. (32) is proven. a computation using (27) and, without
loss e = (0, . . . , 0, 1), u = (0, . . . , 1, 0) shows

eim

= (1)sd/4

sd/2y=1

(~  ~n+)(~+sd/2  ~n)|f (e, ~e)i = |f (e, ~e)i ,

where we used (31) in the last step. together with (32) this proves the statement of
theorem concerning the invariance under (11).

4.4 the equation at n > 0
we next discuss the equations (15)n with n  1. let p0 be the orthogonal projection
onto the states (17), i.e., onto the null space of q0
. we replace them with an equivalent

8

pair of equations, obtained by multiplication of (15)n+1 with p0, resp. of (15)n with q0
,
which is injective on the range of the complementary projection p 0 = 1  p0:

is understood. the equation (33) at n = 0 reads

(we used p0bq1

0 = p0bq1

0 (= bq1

0) .

we shall verify this by explicit computation later on. since a similar issue will show
up in solving the equation (33) at n > 0, let us also present a more general statement,
whose proof is postponed to the next subsection.
lemma let t be linear operators on the range of p0, which transform as real spinors of
spin(d) and commute with the antipode map. then, for each invariant state we have

with  depending only on the associated representation (30).
we now assume having solved the equations (33, 34) up to n  1 for spin(d) invariant
1, . . . n1 (which is true for n  1 = 0), and claim the same is possible for n. since q0

is invertible on the range of p 0, eq. (34)n determines p 0n uniquely. the fact that the
solution so obtained is independent of  and is spin(d) invariant may deserve a comment,
because the equivalence of the equations q = 0 and (q)2 = 0, which holds on (3),
does not apply in the sense of formal power series (12). consider the expansion (14), i.e.,

q = r1/2

as well as its formal square

notice that (q)2 is, by (7), independent of  and spin(d) invariant as an operator on
su(2) invariant power series. similarly, let [q]k (given by the l.h.s. of (15)) and
[(q)2]k be the coecients of the corresponding series. by induction assumption we
have [q]k = 0 for k = 0, . . . , n  1. since q(q) = (q)2, we obtain

for p0n is the only one.

4.5 proof of the lemma

the vectors t0, ( = 1, . . . , sd) transform under spin(d) as real spinors, although they
might be linearly dependent. by reducing matters to the little group as before, any
representation of that sort is specied by the values |f (e, ~e)i of its states (see (17)) at
one point (e, ~e), which are required to satisfy

er(r)|f (e, ~e)i = r(r)|f (e, ~e)i

for r with re = e. pretending the states |f (e, ~e)i to be linearly independent, the
branching spin(d)  spin(d  1) yields

for d = 9, 5 each term on the r.h.s. occurs as often as in (29), and 0 can indeed be
0 are independent. not so in the last case, where the
vectors t0 just belong to 11  11. we continue the discussion for dierent values of d
separately.
 d = 9. any linear transformation k commuting with a spin(9) representation as
above is thus of the form k = s  c. if k also commutes with the antipode map, then
s = c  . applying this to the representation bq1
0 7 t0
yields the claim.
 d = 5. let us regroup (2+  2) (2+  2) = (2+  1i2) (2  1i2). then any map

0 and to the map k : bq1

k commuting with the representation is of the form

k = (1i  k+)  (1i  k) ,

where k is conjugate to k+ if k commutes with the antipode map. this allows for a
four dimensional space of such maps k. to proceed further we shall again assume that
e = (0, . . . , 0, 1) and introduce creation operators

this is clear in the cases where the representation in (30) is already a singlet, i.e., when
 = 0. to prove the two remaining cases we rst establish

or the equivalent equation obtained by multiplication from the right with euu:

to this end we note that, by the invariance of 0, its fermionic part |f (e, ~e)i at e  sd1

sv(vtevet)0 = 0,
i.e.,

(44)

using tu = ut + ut1i and the observation just made we rewrite the l.h.s. of (43) as

solving for the rst term on the r.h.s. proves (43) and hence (42). let us now note
that for d = 9 the fermionic part of 0, resp. of (~  ~e )0 belongs to the 44, resp. 128
representation of spin(9) (see (28)). eq. (42) then implies

(~  ~e )t

esm k

st0 = (c(44)  c(128) + 9)bq1

0 = 9bq1

where we used the values [25] of the casimir: c(44) = c(128) = 18. in the case d = 5
the fermionic part of 0, resp. of (~  ~e )0 belongs to the representation 5, resp. 4  4.
we conclude that

we remark that the proof of (41) can be shortened by using the lemma, according to

in the step before last we relabeled indices in half the expression; in the last one we used

casimir in the representation (30). the above values of c(44) (d = 9) and of c(5) (d = 5)
yield again (41).

just as in (8), the bosonic potential v (= x2y2) is non-negative, but vanishing in regions
of the conguration space that extend to innity (causing the classical partition function
to diverge). quantummechanically, just as in (8), the bosonic system is stabilized by the
zero point energy of uctuations transverse to the at directions; the fermionic matrix
part in (50) exactly cancels this eect, causing the spectrum to cover the whole positive
real axis [19]. as simple as it is, it has remained an open question (for now more than 10
years) whether (50) admits a normalizable zero energy solution, or not. the argument,
derived in a few lines below, gives no as an answer and provides the simplest illustration
of our method: as x  +, q = 0 has two approximate solutions,

+ = e xy2
