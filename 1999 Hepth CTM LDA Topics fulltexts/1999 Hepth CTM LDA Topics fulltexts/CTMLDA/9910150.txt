(40) (41) let us inspect structure correlator (33) closely. noted earlier, r-weight 4. superspace objects carrying r-weight odd coordinates, expansion correlator must start product four left-handed ones. words, correlator nilpotent . moreover, superconformal covariance requires shift-like transformations reduce number, must use four components shift-invariant combinations (38) (notice r-weight 1, even though right-handed spinors). thus, write leading term correlator following form: h0p1p2p3p4i = 2 1232 124f p14|p24|p32|p42(x, u) + o(5 ) . (42) coecient function f depends space-time harmonic variables carries u (1) charges match correlator nilpotent prefactor. present context 8 interested purely conformal properties function, although easy see depend conformally invariant cross-ratios xs (times certain prefactor gives nilpotent term (42) required dilation weight). going remark rest expansion (42) completely determined superconformal covariance. indeed, order keep required r-weight expand pairs . shift-like transformations mix . further, using counting argument before, conclude exists nilpotent invariant made four +s (chirality point 0 prevents us employing 0). so, higher-order terms (42) uniquely related leading one superconformal transformations. besides superconformal covariance, second main requirement correlator h-analyticity (34). since written leading term expansion (42), need take account nilpotent part harmonic derivative (29) (it contributes next level expansion). h-analyticity reduced condition concerning pure harmonic dependence. general solution h-analyticity condition harmonic function charge p d++f p(u) = 0 (cid:26) f p = 0 p < 0; i1 . . . u+ ip f p = u+ f i1...ip p 0.

(50) (51) finally, recall 4 + 1-point correlators type considered uniquely determined leading term expansion. therefore constraints found apply entire supereld correlation function h0p1p2p3p4i, and, means reduction formula (32), n = 2 matter correlators hp1p2p3p4i. conclusion neither extremal subextremal four-point correlators receive quantum corrections beyond tree level. mentioned method explained section 2 leads slightly weaker condition coecient functions subextremal correlators. takes form second-order pde space-time variables requires boundary conditions order x solution. context one might speculate reduction formula automatically takes account additional eld-theory input harder formulate approach based symmetries alone. summarise, seen simple expressions extremal correlators derived ads supergravity {$9908160$} easily understood eld theory side conse- quence analyticity harmonic superspace formalism. furthermore, non-perturbative non- renormalisation theorems proven subject assumption unsuspected contact terms type could interfere application reduction formula {$9908160$}. strong arguments favour assumption given {$9908160$}, including explicit verication reduction formula two loops symmetric case p1 = . . . = p4 = 2. would also like emphasise results hold analytic correlators n = 2 scft n = 4, choice gauge group. believe results extended extremal correlators arbitrary number points, although complete proof would require detailed study nilpotent covariants. topic investigation. acknowledgements: cs would like thank institute advanced study, princeton, hospitality nal stage project. es pw proted stimulating 10 discussions m. bianchi e. dhoker. work supported part british- french scientic programme alliance (project 98074), eu network integrability, non- perturbative eects symmetry quantum eld theory (fmrx-ct96-0012) grant intas-96-0308.
