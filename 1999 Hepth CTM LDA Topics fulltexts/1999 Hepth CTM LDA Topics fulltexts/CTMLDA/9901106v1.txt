abstract

the low-energy theory on the world volume of parallel static d3-branes of type
0 strings is the yang-mills theory with six scalar elds in the adjoint representation.
one-loop corrections in this theory induce coleman-weinberg eective potential, which
can be interpreted as an interaction energy of d3-branes. the potential is repulsive
at short distances and attractive at large ones.
in the equilibrium, a large number
of d3-branes forms a spherical shell with the radius proportional to the characteristic
energy scale of the world-volume theory.

1 introduction

the duality of n = 4, d = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory to the type iib string
theory on the near-horizon geometry of the three-brane [1, 2, 3] have led to considerable
progress in understanding of its large-n limit. along the same lines, type 0b theory on the
background of rr charged three-brane solution was proposed to give a dual description of
non-supersymmetric d = 4 gauge theory coupled to adjoint bosonic matter [4]. perturba-
tively unstable tachyon of type 0 theory was argued to be stabilized in the presence of the
three-brane through interaction with background rr ux.

the low-energy theory on the world volume of n coincident type 0b d3-branes [5] is
u(n) gauge theory with six scalar elds in the adjoint representation. according to [4], this
theory has a dual description in terms of type 0b strings on the background of the three-
brane. the classical gravity approximation to the dual picture already involves qualitative
features expected from the gauge theory, such as logarithmic dependence of the coupling on
a scale with uv xed point at zero coupling [6, 7]. this duality also predicts ir xed point
at innity [7].

the gauge theory considered in [4, 6, 7] has the same tree-level bosonic action as n = 4
sym theory. so, the scalar potentials in both theories has the same at directions. these
at directions correspond to transverse coordinates of d3-branes. but, unlike in n = 4
theory, in the non-supersymmetric case the at directions are not protected from being
lifted by quantum corrections, which reects the fact that parallel d3-branes of type 0
strings interact with one another, while type ii d-branes are bps states and they can be
moved apart at no energy cost. qualitative arguments based on the string calculation of
the interaction potential suggest that type 0 branes repulse at short distances and attract
at large ones [4].

we study the interaction between type 0 d3-branes computing the one-loop eective
potential in the world-volume eld theory. similar calculations for n = 4 sym theory with
the supersymmetry broken by the nite temperature [8] were done in [9]. we nd that the
potential has a maximum at zero separation between branes (at zero expectation values of
scalar elds) and gains a minimum at nite separation due to coleman-weinberg mechanism
[10] in complete agreement with expectations from the string theory.

of the type 0 string theory is

(2.1)

we consider the theory in the euclidean space from the very beginning. strictly speaking, the
eld theory with the action (2.1) is not renormalizable and require counterterms quadratic
and quartic in scalar elds. in what follows we imply that all necessary counterterms are
added to the action.

the scalar potential in (2.1) has a degenerate set of minima:

cl = diag(yi

a = 1, . . . , n.

the coordinates yi
dimensional space. since the potential in (2.1) does not depend on yi
interact at the classical level.

a, i = 1, . . . , 6 describe positions of n parallel static three-branes in nine-
a, d-branes do not

however, one-loop corrections induce interaction between branes via coleman-weinberg
mechanism [10]. we calculate the interaction potential expanding scalar elds around the
classical background (2.2):

i = i

cl + i

(2.3)

and integrating out quantum uctuations. to integrate over the gauge elds, we add to the
action the gauge xing term:

sgf = 

1

ym z d4x tr (cid:16)a  [i

cl, i](cid:17)2

,

where  is a gauge xing parameter. the action for ghosts in the chosen gauge is

sgh =

ym z d4x tr (cid:16)cdc  [i

cl, c][i, c](cid:17) .

(2.4)

(2.5)

expanding the action to the second order in uctuations and integrating them out we get
the one-loop eective potential:

(2.6)

the rst term is the contribution of the gauge elds, the second is that of the ghosts, and
the third of the scalars. by y i we denote the following matrix in the adjoint representation
of u(n):

taking into account that [y i, y j] = 0, we nd:

y i = [i

cl, ].

the potential of interaction between two d-branes (g. 1):

v (r) =

(3.1)

is such that d-branes repulse at short distances. thus, a stack of d-branes put on top of
each other is unstable. the d-branes will tend to separate by distances of order a. in the
equilibrium, transverse coordinates of d-branes satisfy the equations:

(yi

(3.2)

we are interested in the case when the number of d-branes, n, is large. in the n  
limit, d-branes form continuous spherically symmetric distribution and the equation (3.2)
takes the form:

yi
af (|ya|2) = 0.

(3.3)

the function f , in principle, can have several zeros, but we adopt rather natural assumption
that for the conguration of d-branes which has minimal energy the equation (3.3) has only
one root, |y|2 = r2. so, the d-branes in the equilibrium will form a spherical shell of radius
r in six-dimensional transverse space with a surface rr charge density  = n/3r5. from
eqs. (3.2), (3.3) we nd:

and the interaction energy per unit volume, which shifts the tension of a d-brane, is

4 discussion

the interaction potential between d3-branes in type 0 theory calculated in the world-volume
theory at weak ym coupling behaves as expected from qualitative analysis in the string

the denition of the ym coupling in terms of vevs of the dilaton and of the tachyon elds is discussed

in [7, 11].

theory [4], the branes repulse at short distances and attract at large ones with an equilibrium
point at nite separation. as a result, d-branes of type 0 strings cannot be put on top of
each other. they tend to spread over the distances of order of the characteristic scale of the
low-energy theory on the world volume.

as in [4, 6, 7], we have considered electrically charged d3-branes of the type 0b string
theory. dyonic branes with equal electric and magnetic charges were discussed in [12]. the
world-volume theory on the self-dual branes was shown to be conformal in the large-n limit
[12], so the coleman-weinberg potential is not generated in this case.
