we derive d-brane gauge theories for c3/zzn  zzn orbifolds with discrete torsion and
study the moduli space of a d-brane at a point. we show that, as suggested in previous

work, closed string moduli do not fully resolve the singularity, but the resulting space 
containing n  1 conifold singularities  is somewhat surprising. fractional branes also
have unusual properties.

we also dene an index which is the cft analog of the intersection form in geomet-

ric compactication, and use this to show that the elementary d6-brane wrapped about
t 6/zzn  zzn must have u (n) world-volume gauge symmetry.

1. introduction

string theory can be well dened on spaces that from the classical geometric point of

view have singularities. in recent years, d-branes have brought a new perspective on this.
in this work we will study d-branes at a c3/zzn zzn singularity with discrete torsion,
following the ideas of [1,2,3]. discrete torsion was dened in [1] for orbifolds m/ in world-

sheet terms: dierent sectors in the closed string path integral distinguished by their

twisted boundary conditions are weighed by phases. the rst example is genus one with
two twists g and h corresponding to the two generators of 1 and a weight (g, h)2. higher
loop modular invariance requires (g, h) to be a cocycle in h 2(, u (1)). for  = zzn  zzn
this is zzn and we study the case where (g, h) is a generator of this group (minimal

discrete torsion).

singularities can appear as degenerations in calabi-yau manifolds and from the point

of view of algebraic geometry admit two types of desingularization. singularities caused

by degeneration of the complex structure can be deformed, while singularities caused by

degeneration of the kahler form can be resolved (or blown up). as part of a compact space

the possible resolutions depend on the global topology of the space: harmonic (2, 1)-forms

correspond to complex structure deformations, and harmonic (1, 1)-forms to kahler form
deformations. the analysis of the conformal eld theory of strings on c3/zzn  zzn uses
standard orbifold techniques and we review these results. while string theory without

discrete torsion allows only kahler deformations, the theory with minimal discrete torsion

allows only complex structure deformations. in the latter case, although conformal eld

theory does not lead to a clear geometric picture of these deformations, one can make

hypotheses based on parameter counting and other general considerations which strongly

suggest that the complex structure deformations provided by the string theory do not allow

completely resolving the singularity. in [2] it was suggested that the n = 2 model contains

an irresolvable conifold singularity, while the n = 3 model could contain an irresolvable

singularity of codimension 2.

by studying a d-brane in this background, one sees space-time arise in a dierent way.

the low energy motion of d-branes is described by a gauge theory, and space-time appears

as its moduli space. the two types of deformation are then obtained as modications of the

f-atness conditions (complex structure) and of the d-atness conditions (kahler form).

world-volume theories for d-branes at orbifold singularities can be obtained as pro-
jections of n = 4 super yang-mills theory and in [3] it was argued that discrete torsion is

1

implemented by doing this with projective representations of , and the c3/zz2  zz2 case
was studied. the resulting moduli space was exactly as predicted in [2]: after turning on

all moduli, an isolated singularity remains.

in the present paper we extend this to minimal discrete torsion for c3/zzn  zzn
and arbitrary n. we nd that for arbitrary n, after turning on all the available complex
structure deformations, the three xed lines are resolved, but n  1 conifold singularities
appear.

in section 2 we present the orbifolds and nd the closed string marginal operators for

various choices of discrete torsion. in section 3 we derive the gauge theory, in section 4

describe the generic branch of moduli space, and in section 5 study special branches which

appear at partial resulutions.

the interpretation of fractional branes is discussed in section 6. there are many

dierences from the case without discrete torsion; some puzzles are listed, including one

on charge quantization. we point out that charge quantization is best formulated in terms
of an index, trab (1)f in the open string sector with boundary conditions a and b, and
resolve the puzzle in this case. section 7 summarizes the conclusions.

2. c3/zzn  zzn orbifolds and discrete torsion

in this section we introduce the orbifolds we are going to study and discuss their
possible resolutions. let c3 be described by three complex coordinates, z1, z2, z3. the
group  = zzn  zzn is generated by two elements g1 and g2. we will denote a generic
element ga

2 of  as (a, b).

as an action of zzn  zzn on c3, we take r(g) dened by

g1 : (z1, z2, z3)  (z1, e 2i
g2 : (z1, z2, z3)  (e

(2.1)

this is the unique faithful representation in the sense that any r(g) = r(h(g)) for some
group homomorphism h.

theories that arise when (m, n) = 1, that is, when  2m is a generator of zzn.

2.1. possible resolutions of c3/zzn  zzn

one can dene c3/zzn zzn as an ane variety in c4, given by f (x, y, z, t) = 0, where
f (x, y, z, t) = xyz  tn. the -invariant variables are mi = (zi)n and b = z1z2z3, related
by m1m2m3 = bn. this variety presents non-isolated singularities, in the form of three
(complex) xed lines of c2/zzn singularities: (z1, 0, 0), (0, z2, 0) and (0, 0, z3). these three
lines intersect at the origin, that is a xed point under the action of the whole group .

using toric geometry it is fairly straightforward to give a description of the possible
blow-up resolutions of c3/zzn  zzn. the fact that the singularities are non-isolated does
not aect the discussion at this level. the discussion parallels the one for c2/zzn [4], so we
will be brief. the fan for c3/zzn  zzn has a single big cone, determined by three vectors
(0, 0, 1), (n, 0, 1) and (0, n, 1). the rst intersection (away from the origin) of the three

edges of the cone with the lattice determines the hyperplane z = 1, so the singularities

are gorenstein. the intersection is a triangle in the hyperplane, with vertices (0, 0, 1),

(n, 0, 1) and (0, n, 1). the resolution is far from unique: the possible blow-up resolutions

are represented by dierent triangulations of this triangle. for a given n there are many

possible triangulations, all related by op transitions.

in [5], the case n = 2 without discrete torsion was studied using d-brane methods.

as we discuss below the moduli are kahler moduli and it was shown using toric methods

that all the possible resolutions can be obtained from the d-brane gauge theory.

another way to resolve the orbifold is to deform its complex structure. to nd the

possible relevant deformations, rst we compute the ideal generated by the partial deriva-
tives of f : j = {if} = {yz, xz, xy, tn1}. the quotient of the ring of polynomials in
x, y, z, t by j gives us the set of relevant deformations of f :

q =

= {xa, yb, zc, 1, t..tn2}

(2.2)

c[x, y, z, t]

{if}

the quotient ring is innite dimensional, something that matches with the fact that

we have non-isolated singularities.

if we deform f adding a power of x, we resolve a

complex line (and similarly for y and z). if we deform by 1 or t, we resolve completely
the variety. if we resolve by tr with 1 < r  n  2 we reduce the singularities to those of
xyz  tr.

we see that mathematically these orbifolds can be completely resolved by deformation

of their complex structure. this does not necessarily mean that all of these deformations

are available in the physical theory  at the very least, each physical deformation (modulus)

must correspond to a marginal operator in closed string theory on the orbifold. thus we

need to compute this spectrum.

3

2.2. cohomology

space-time supersymmetry relates marginal operators to ground states in the ramond

sector. as is well known, for sigma model compactication these are in one-to-one cor-

respondence with the cohomology of the target space, so if the orbifold is the limit of a
smooth target space m this computation will give us h (m ). we will also think of the

results as dening the cohomology of the orbifold. as we are about to see, it depends

markedly on whether we introduce discrete torsion or not.

we follow the procedure used in [2] (see also [6]). there are n2 sectors in the theory:
one untwisted sector corresponding to the element (0, 0) and n2  1 twisted sectors corre-
sponding to the remaining elements of . for each sector g, we let mg be the subset of
c3 xed under the action of g. in the ordinary case, without discrete torsion, the usual
sigma model analysis generalizes to show that the ground states in the g-twisted sector
correspond to forms h p,q(mg) that are invariant under the action of :

r(h)w = w

h  .

(2.3)

such a form p,q will contribute to h p+s,q+s(m ) with s a computable function of g: for g
acting as zi  eii zi with 0  i < 2, it is given by
.

(2.4)

s = xi

i
2

this shift is derived for example in [6] as the shift in the fermion number and u (1) charges

of the vacuum for the twisted sector g.

let us start with the untwisted sector (0, 0). the xed point set in this case is of
course c3 itself, but not all the forms dened on c3 are -invariant. for instance dz1  dz1
is invariant and it is kept, but dz1  dz2 is not invariant and it is projected out. the
contribution to the hodge diamond coming from the untwisted sector is, for n > 2

for n = 2 the untwisted sector has instead h2,1 = h1,2 = 3, since for instance the form

dz1  dz2  dz3 survives.

4

now lets consider the n2  1 twisted sectors. we are going to discuss the twisted
sector corresponding to the element (a, b). first we have to look for the xed point set

of the element (a, b). there are two classes of elements, according to their xed point
sets. the 3(n  1) elements of the form (a, 0), (0, b) and (a, a) have a (complex) line of
xed points: (z1, 0, 0), (0, z2, 0) and (0, 0, z3) respectively, as can be seen from (2.1). the
remaining (n  1)(n  2) elements have only the origin as their xed point set.

as a warm-up, we compute the contribution of the twisted sectors for the theories
without discrete torsion. for each of the 3(n  1) elements of the kind (a, 0), (0, b) and
(a, a), the cohomology before projecting is generated by 1, dz, dz and dz  dz. without
discrete torsion 1 and dz  dz are -invariant, whereas dz and dz are not. the shift for
these 3(n  1) elements is easily computed to be s = 1 for all of them, so in the case of
theories without discrete torsion, the contribution of these 3(n  1) twisted sectors to the
hodge diamond is h1,1 = h2,2 = 3(n  1). for the remaining (n  1)(n  2) elements,
the origin is the only xed point, and in absence of discrete torsion, the (0, 0)-form 1 is
-invariant. after the shift, half of these elements contribute to h 1,1, and the other half
contribute to h 2,2. all in all, in absence of discrete torsion, the contribution of the twisted

sectors to the hodge diamond is

after this warm-up, lets turn to the theories with discrete torsion. the whole discus-

sion depends on r = gcd(m, n), and the results dier markedly between the cases r = 1 (m

and n are relative primes) and r > 1. now in the sector g we keep the forms w such that

((g, h))2 r(h)w = w

h  

(2.5)

since (1, h) = 1 h, the untwisted sector remains the same, so we go to the twisted
sectors. lets deal rst with the 3(n  1) sectors corresponding to elements that x a
complex line. recall that before projecting the cohomology is given by 1, dz, dz and dzdz.
for 1 and dzdz, r(h)w = w, so they survive if ((g, h))2 = 1, and this happens for 3(r1)
elements of these sectors. furthermore, if r = 1 there are exactly 3 elements for which dz

5

is kept and 3 elements for which dz is kept. if r > 1 then dz and dz are projected out. as
before, the shift for these elements is 1, but now the forms that we keep are in h 0,1 and
h 1,0 of the respective xed point sets, so they contribute to h 1,2 and h 2,1 of the whole

orbifold. finally, we have to consider the remaining twisted sectors, associated to elements

that only leave xed the origin. now the only element in the cohomology is 1, and it is
kept by (r  1)(r  2) elements, half of them contributing after the shift to h1,1 and half
of them to h2,2.

putting together these facts, the twisted sector contribution to the hodge diamond

for the r = 1 case is:

when r > 1 the eect of discrete torsion is just to decrease the number of ground
states in h1,1 and h2,2 compared to the case without discrete torsion (that can be considered

a particular case, m = 0, r = n). on the other hand, when r = 1 there are no kahler

deformations available, and we nd the same number of complex deformations for every
n. thus the general zzn  zzn singularity will have either complex structure or kahler
deformations, but not both.

3. the d-brane gauge theories

in this section we derive the gauge theory that describes d-branes on the c3/zzn zzn
orbifold with discrete torsion for gcd(m, n) = 1. after presenting the gauge theory, we

look for its moduli space and check that, for the regular representation, it reproduces

6

the original orbifold. we then include the modication of the superpotential due to the

3 possible complex structure deformations that we found in the previous section, and

determine the corresponding deformed moduli space. as we will see, the addition of the

complex structure deformations resolves the xed lines of the original orbifold, leaving
n  1 conifold singularities.

3.1. derivation of the quotient theory

the general procedure is by now well known [7]. there are two choices that we have

to make: the action of  on space-time, r(g), and the action of  on the chan-paton

indices, (g). if we want to describe n independent d-branes on the orbifold, we start by
placing ||n d-branes on the original c3. initially this corresponds to a u (||n ) sym
theory with n = 4 in d = 4. to construct the quotient gauge theory we impose projection
conditions for the gauge and the scalar elds

a = (g)a(g)1

zi = rij(g)(cid:0)(g)zj(g)1(cid:1)

(3.1)

plugging back the elds surviving these projections into the original u (||n ) theory, we
obtain the quotient gauge theory.

our choice of the space-time action is (2.1); since this lies in su (3), the corresponding
theory will have n = 1 in d = 4. where does the discrete torsion enter the game? as
observed in [3], it is implemented in the gauge theory by taking the action on the chan-

paton indices to be a projective representation of , that is (g)(h) = (g, h)(gh).

according to [8], when    2m is a primitive nth root of 1 (true when gcd(m, n) = 1),

zzn  zzn has a unique irreducible projective representation. it is

1(g1) = p

1(g2) = q

(3.2)

where the matrices p and q are as follows. for n odd,

(3.4)

note that p q = qp , so although  is abelian, the projective representation is not.

the general representation is a direct sum of m copies of this:

m = 1  1m .

in particular, the regular representation of dimension n2 is n.

we can now give the solution of the projection (3.1) for every m such that (m, n) = 1.
by composing the space-time action (2.1) with a zzn  zzn, the general solution based on
the irreducible representation (3.2) can be brought to the form

a = i

z1 = p

z2 = q

z3 = (p q)1.

(3.5)

the most general solution is obtained by tensoring this nn solution with mm matrices.
intuitively we expect a theory describing n true branes away from the origin will
involve ||n = n2n images and thus use n copies of the regular representation, i.e. m
with m = n n.1 on the other hand string consistency conditions do not require m to be

a multiple of n; we will return to the interpretation of this possibility later.

after tensoring (3.5) with m m matrices and substituting into the the u (m n) sym

theory, we obtain the quotient theory, which we proceed to describe.

3.2. the orbifold theory

the gauge theory describing c3/zzn  zzn with minimal discrete torsion is a u (m )

theory with three chiral superelds i, i = 1, 2, 3 in the adjoint. the superpotential is

w = tr{1(23  132)}

(3.6)

1 there is a simple argument why one expects to need m  n to get a three complex dimen-
sional moduli space. one can see that supersymmetric vacua (in the undeformed orbifold theory)

are still described by commuting matrices in the original u (m n) theory; to make commuting

matrices out of the solution (3.5) one must tensor them with another projective representation

with the opposite cocycle, which will have dimension m  n.

8

this leads to the f-atness conditions

and d-atness conditions

ij  1ji = 0

i 6= j

[i, 

i ] = 0.

xi

(3.7)

(3.8)

the superpotential (3.6) preserves a u (1)3 subgroup of the su (4) r-symmetry of
n = 4 super yang-mills, the individual phase rotations of the i. the diagonal u (1) is
the usual n = 1 r-symmetry.

so far, we havent introduced in the gauge theory the three complex structure defor-

mations that we found in the previous section. these appear as the following deformation

of the superpotential of the gauge theory:

w = xi

i tr i.

(3.9)

this is consistent with the u (1)3 symmetry if we assign 1 the charges (0, 1, 1), and

similarly for 2 and 3. the symmetry will then prohibit corrections higher order in .2

the new term modies the f-atness conditions to
12  121 = 3
23  132 = 1
31  113 = 2

(3.10)

the d-atness conditions (3.8) remain the same. our goal will be to nd the new

moduli space, corresponding to these deformed conditions.

4. moduli spaces as varieties

in our discussion of the moduli space, we will use the gauge invariant polynomials3

mij...k =

n

tr {ij . . . k}

(4.1)

it can be checked by world sheet computation that the disk diagram with a bulk insertion of

the twisted closed string operator v (i) and a boundary insertion of v (fi), the auxiliary eld in
the i multiplet, is non-zero. the u (1)3 symmetry is the unbroken subgroup of so(6) rotations
around the xed point and one can also check that v (i) has the charges stated above.

3 our normalizations dier from those of [3].

9

taking the trace of the f-atness conditions (3.10) we nd

mij = (cid:0)1  1(cid:1)1

k  k

(4.2)

let us rst solve the f and d conditions in the undeformed theory. we start with

the regular representation. for m = n (that is, n = 1, a single d-brane), recalling that

p q = qp , we see that a solution is given by

1 = z1q

2 = z2p

3 = z3(qp )1

(4.3)

what is the equation for the moduli space? if we dene n1 as the number of 1s in

a given gauge invariant polynomial mij...k, and similarly for n2 and n3, the only non-zero
gauge invariant polynomials have u (1)3 charges n1  n2  n3 (n). in particular

so it is natural to identify these gauge invariant polynomials with the -invariant variables
mi and b of c3/zzn  zzn, and conclude that the undeformed moduli space is

m22 . . . 2

= (1)n1(m123)n.

(4.5)

from now on, we drop the brackets, and unless otherwise stated, it is understood that

mii..i has n indices.

what happens if we dont take the regular representation? for 1  m < n, taking
determinants on both sides of the original f-atness conditions (3.7) and recalling that 
is a primitive nth-root of 1, we readily see that |i||j| = 0, so at least two out of three
matrices have zero determinant. by going to a basis where one of these matrices with

zero determinant, say 1, is diagonal, we can easily argue that most of the o diagonal

elements of 2 and 3 have to vanish in order to satisfy the f-atness conditions, and
then, for m < n, the remaining o diagonal elements have to vanish in order to satisify

10

the d-atness conditions. therefore, for m < n, all the solutions of the f and d atness

conditions are diagonal matrices, and there are no higgs branches. for m = 1, the moduli

space is given by the three lines m1 = m2 = 0, m2 = m3 = 0 and m1 = m3 = 0.

we turn to the deformed case. for the regular representation, there is a simple three

parameter family of solutions of the deformed f-atness conditions (3.10):

1 = z1q + 3

p 1
z2

2 = z2p + 1

qp
z3

3 = z3(qp )1 + 2

q1
z1

(4.6)

these do not satisfy the d-atness conditions and it appears to be quite hard to nd

explicit solutions of both conditions. on the other hand we are guaranteed by general

results that, for every solution of the f-atness conditions, there will exist a unique gauge

equivalence class of solutions of the d-atness conditions [9].

in the present case it is
dened by minimizing the functional f = tr pi i+
i over a gauge orbit i  gig1
with g  gl(n) the complexied gauge group. we do not need to nd these solutions
explicitly in order to describe the moduli space with its complex structure; they would

have been useful if (for example) we wanted to compute the metric.

for many purposes it is more useful to describe the moduli space as a variety, i.e. as

the solutions of a set of polynomial equations between gauge invariant polynomials. in

particular this will bypass the need to determine which of the solutions (4.6) are gauge

equivalent. an overcomplete set of such equations is obtained by combining all equations
tr w ()p () = 0 for all polynomials p with the complete set of identities on gauge-

invariant polynomials constructed from matrices of dimension n. the latter are quite

simple for n = 2 and this approach was followed in [3]; however for n > 2, the system of

relations between gauge invariant polynomials is very complicated.

the observation that makes the problem tractable is that, if we are satised just

to study the moduli space of the gauge theory, then relations valid on the moduli space

are good enough for us. in particular, the f-atness conditions (3.10) turn out to be a

powerful constraint that allows us to establish many relations among the gauge invariant

polynomials that, though not valid in general, hold on the moduli space. in fact, we can
argue that on the moduli space of this u (n) gauge theory, when all  6= 0, any non-zero
gauge invariant polynomial can be written in terms of the 4 gauge invariant polynomials

used to dene the undeformed moduli space! the proof of this statement is presented in

the appendix.

accepting this result, we conclude that the deformed moduli space is indeed a variety
in c4. as we argued the branch we found is three dimensional and by general results in

11

algebraic geometry a three dimensional subvariety must be a hypersurface; i.e. the solution
of a polynomial equation in c4. this equation must respect the u (1)3 symmetry acting
on i and i as well as an obvious permutation symmetry.

it is natural to suppose that this equation would be a deformation of (4.5) with

corrections polynomial in the s. adding all polynomial perturbations respecting the

symmetries we arrive at the ansatz

now that we have checked the equation (4.7) on the explicit solutions (4.6), we can

assert that it is the equation dening this branch of moduli space; the hypothesis that it

might take the form (4.7) has been explicitly veried. in general the equations dening the

moduli space derived by following the general procedure could have additional solutions

which will be additional branches of the moduli space. let us focus for now on this branch.

the coecients ak correspond to the nth chebyshev polynomial of the rst kind:
tn(cos ) = cos n, and thus the equation describing this branch of the moduli space takes
a simple form: it is f (mii..i, m123) = 0 where

f (m11..1, m22..2, m33..3, m123) =

this is not the general deformation of (4.5) and thus this variety might generically
be singular. singularities will be solutions of f/mii..i = f/m123 = f = 0. to start

and since the determinant of this quadratic form is dierent from zero, locally the remaining

singularities are conifold singularities.

5. more on moduli spaces

the analysis of the previous section treated the generic branch of moduli space, but
there can also be special branches. the discussion depends very much on how many  6= 0
so we discuss each case separately. in addition we consider the moduli spaces for m < n

which are also physically relevant. finally, we will also be interested in the coulomb

branch of moduli space. this is dened in the p-brane theories with p < 3 obtained by

naive dimensional reduction as follows: this theory contains scalar partners of the gauge
eld, which we can write as real adjoint elds x i. their potential will be minimized by
any vevs with [x i, x j] = 0 and if  = 0 and  = 0 this is generically a supersymmetric
vacuum with unbroken u (1)n. the coulomb branch of interest to us is then the moduli
space of such vacua with general i.

13

5.1. the undeformed moduli space

in the orbifold limit, when we set i to zero, the equation that describes the generic

branch is

m11...1m22...2m33...3 = (1)n1m n

123

(5.1)

this moduli space has three xed (complex) lines of singularities, all three with m123 =

0: m11..1 = m22..2 = 0, m22..2 = m33..3 = 0 and m11..1 = m33..3 = 0. these three xed
lines correspond to the three lines of c2/zzn singularities of c3/zzn  zzn.

the xed lines also are in correspondence with the moduli space for m = 1. for

m = 1 the f-atness conditions become 12 = 3 (and permutations) and for i = 0 the

solutions are just the xed lines. this also generalizes to m > 1: the coulomb branch

allows a single non-zero i in each of the u (1) factors and i can be dierent in each factor.

5.2. turning on one modulus

taking 3 6= 0, the moduli space is now given by

m11..1m22..2m33..3  m33..3n

3 = (1)n1m n

123

(5.2)

in this moduli space, two of the original xed lines, given by m11..1m22..2 = 0, (plus
m33..3 = m123 = 0) are deformed to a smooth xed c at m11..1m22..2 = n
3 , m33..3 =
m123 = 0. this xed line is the only singularity and again it corresponds to the moduli

space for m = 1: 12 = 3 and 3 = 0.

to ease the notation, lets rewrite (5.2) as xyz  zn

3 = tn. for a xed value of z 6= 0,
this can be written as xy = tn + n
3 , which is a resolution of an an1 singularity. this
resolution can be blown up introducing n  1 independent homology 2-cycles and a large
set of supersymmetric ip1s. all this is bered over z and degenerates at the xed line, a
picture which suggests that on the total space each of these ip1s corresponds to a 3-cycle.

5.3. 2, 3 6= 0

there are no singularities in the m = n moduli space. this matches with the fact

that there are no solutions for the m = 1 case. recall that the analysis is local: what has

happened is that the singularities have been sent to innity.

14

5.4. i 6= 0

when all the moduli are turned on, there are n 1 singularities on the m = n moduli
space. on the other hand, there are two solutions for m = 1: i = (jk/i)1/2 (with
the same sign taken for all i). in this case, the correspondence we have observed so far

between singularities of the m = n moduli space and solutions of m = 1 is no longer

evident.

in the appendix we argue that for the regular representation there is only a nite
6= 0, for k < n. we can display n + 1 of them (actually

number of solutions with m ii..i

m + 1 of them, for m  n)

these n + 1 special solutions (the only commuting ones) seem to correspond to the

and for m = n generically dont coincide with the singularities.

6. fractional branes

we now discuss the interpretation of the coulomb branch of the gauge theory. for p-

branes with p < 3 the world-volume theory is the naive dimensional reduction of the d = 4

theory we described and contains scalar partners of the gauge eld, which we write as the
real adjoint elds x i. their potential will be minimized by any vevs with [x i, x j] = 0
and if  = 0 and  = 0 this is a supersymmetric vacuum with unbroken u (1)n.

not only does this branch have n moduli describing positions in the space transverse to

the orbifold but it is clear from world-sheet considerations that it looks like a gravitational

and rr source of strength 1/n (compared to the original p-brane) at each of these points.

thus the coulomb branch describes fractional branes bound to the xed point, just as

for the case without discrete torsion [10]. in that case these were interpreted as branes

wrapped around hidden two-cycles. however, the singularities with discrete torsion do

15

not contain two-cycles in the usual string theory sense (we did not see the corresponding

closed string states) so the story must be rather dierent here.

the most obvious dierence is that, since there is a unique irreducible projective rep-

resentation, the fractional branes are classied by a single conserved zzn quantum number.

this shows up in the fact that the gauge theory is labelled by the single integer m , and
if m  n we can nd mixed coulomb-higgs branches embedding the higgs branch in any
u (n) subgroup of u (m ). thus n fractional branes can annihilate to form a conventional

brane.

the appearance of fractional branes in these models raises questions concerning their

interpretation, their location and their charge. let us raise these issues in turn.

6.1. interpretation

in previous cases, fractional branes were interpreted as wrapped p + 2 branes. for

the unresolved orbifold and when one xed line is resolved, this picture makes some sense

here. since the xed lines are xed under a single group element, locally the geometry is
c2/zznc and we expect to see branes wrapped around these hidden two-cycles. after the
resolution, one can check that the volume (integral of the holomorphic two-form) of the

two-cycles increases with distance from the origin (in the third coordinate), which explains

why the branes will then be conned to the neighborhood of the origin.

however these two-cycles are not homology two-cycles so it is not obvious why such

wrapped branes should be stable. indeed there is only a conserved zzn quantum number.

this strongly suggests that the objects have some interpretation as branes wrapped about

torsion 2-cycles, which could make contact with the proposal of [11].

this proposal had two parts. the rst point was that for geometric compactications,

or more precisely with hom(h 2(m ),c). this is in agreement with our suggested interpre-

discrete torsion is naturally identied with r b over the torsion part of the 2-cohomology,
tation, as the r b  c(1) on the d2-brane would lead to the correct fractional d0-charge.

the second part of their proposal was that orbifolds with discrete torsion would admit

natural resolutions (possibly not calabi-yau) which exhibited this torsion explicitly. we

have nothing to say about this beyond the comment that if so, it should also be true for

our resolved moduli spaces.

in light of the connection between d-brane charges and k-theory [12], we can con-

template the possibility that the presence of these torsion 2-cycles can be conrmed by

16

studying the k-theory of the moduli space, rather than its cohomology (anyway, recall that

we are being a little bit cavalier with the use of the word cohomology for our varieties).

as was pointed out in [13], independently of the details of the variety, in the presence

of discrete torsion the available susy cycles are three-cycles, but we dont have d(p + 3)-

branes to wrap about these cycles! take iia for deniteness; the natural objects analogous

to the fractional branes of [10] in this situation would be strings coming from wrapped

d4-branes. the three-cycles are not localized to the xed points but instead are the two-
cycles of the resolved c2/zzn xed lines, suspended over a real line connecting two conifold
singularities.

it is not surprising that we did not see these objects in the framework discussed here

but we are left with the interesting question: can we develop a gauge theory (or other

construction) of these strings ? perhaps a d2-brane with one dimension stretched along a

xed line could be deformed into two of these objects.

6.2. location of fractional branes

recall that the moduli space for m = 1 with all  non-zero consisted of two points
()
i = (jk/i)1/2. thus there are two physically (though not topologically) distinct
elementary fractional branes.

one can compute the values of the invariant polynomials for these congurations and

intuitively, one might have expected these to be identiable with singularities of the moduli
space for the regular representation. since there are n  1 singularities and two fractional
branes, this intuition already has problems. in fact the invariants corresponding to these

points are not on the generic branch at all!

this situation persists for combinations of fractional branes. let us consider n frac-
tional branes, for which there are n + 1 distinct combinations of the two solutions ().
only for n even and equal numbers n+ and n of (+) and () is this point on the
generic branch (and then it is a singularity).

thus the decay of the n fractional branes to a regular brane almost always encounters

a potential barrier. another way to see this is to compute the value of the superpotential

w () at the various solutions. if we consider domain wall solutions of the four dimensional

gauge theory interpolating between the two solutions (or reduce to two dimensions), they
will be bps with central charge equal to the dierence w (a)  w (b).
check that the higgs branch has w = 0, while the fractional brane solutions have w =
123(n+  n).

it is easy to

17

another interesting denition of the location of the fractional branes would be to

consider a larger theory containing both a regular and a fractional brane, and nd the

values of the regular brane moduli for which additional massless states appear in the

system. we leave this as a problem for future research.

the picture looks very non-geometric, on any scale comparable with , not just at

s

the singularity. this leads to potential paradoxes in the large r11 limit as we can take
 >> lp11 = g1/3
ls, and at these scales we expect that m theory is geometric. it is not
too clear if these are actual paradoxes. for one thing, we did not compute metric data and
it might be that the o() separation in complex coordinates does not translate into an
o() distance. even if it does, if we try to take the large r11 limit a la matrix theory,
the large n limit might produce a very dierent picture. it would be interesting to nd

some geometric picture which can evolve smoothly to the one presented here.

6.3. charge quantization

fractional branes carry 1/n of the charge of the original branes. at rst sight this

seems to conict wih the dirac quantization condition for d-brane charges.

in models

without discrete torsion, a way which has been proposed out of this paradox is by analogy

with the answer to the familiar question of why the fractional charge of quarks is not

inconsistent with the dirac quantization condition for monopoles [14]. in both cases the

fractionally charged objects carry an additional charge, and that can modify the dirac

quantization condition.
in the case of quarks this charge is of course color, and if the
group is u (1)em  su (n )c the quantization condition is eg = 2n/n . for fractional
branes, both in the ale case and in the t 6/zzn  zzn without discrete torsion, from
h1,1 6= 0 we see that there are 2-cycles, and the original 3-form is reduced on them to a
1-form. fractional branes are charged under this reduced 1-form [10], and that could solve

the paradox.

however, in the present case, this cannot be the resolution, as there are no rr gauge

elds in twisted sectors for the objects to couple to. consider d0s in iia for deniteness;
we found that all the twist states corresponded to elements of h 1,2, whose rr partners

are scalars.

checking the dirac condition requires introducing the d6-brane and either computing

properly normalized charges for the two objects or else computing their interactions directly

(perhaps from the annulus diagram, along the lines of [15]). the rst computation involves

the volume of the internal space and when passing to the orbifold, gives a factor of the

18

order of the group which could resolve the problem. however, an indication that something
more unusual is going on here is that the order of the group is n2, compared with the 1/n

we are trying to account for.

the second computation can be done easily if we take the open string (gauge theory)

point of view and restrict to the massless sector. in [16] it was shown (in a very similar
matrix theory problem) that the magnetic monopole interaction between a dp and d(6p)
brane can be derived from the berry phase of the hamiltonian describing fermionic strings

stretched between these objects. these fermions are a doublet of the so(3) transverse to
both branes and their hamiltonian is simply h = ~  ~x; it is well known that the berry
phase for this hamiltonian is described by the magnetic monopole gauge potential. on the

other hand, massive string modes will always come in pairs with cancelling berry phase.
in particular we can ignore the winding states around t 6 for this computation.

thus the interaction relevant for the dirac quantization condition can be computed

simply by counting fermionic strings. it also means that perturbative consistency of string

theory guarantees that d-branes will satisfy the dirac rule.

the matrix nab = trab (1)f counting massless ramond doublets (with chirality)
between the ath and bth brane is the cft analog of the intersection form in a geometric

compactication. it is an index and thus will not vary under continuous deformations. in

the geometric case, if we consider a set of branes wrapping an integral homology basis,

this form must be integral and unimodular by poincare duality, proving that the dirac

condition is saturated. by computing nab in a cft compactication we can check that a
particular set of d-branes also saturates the dirac condition and is thus complete.

d6-branes wrapped about the internal space in these orbifold theories are dened by

the same projection (3.1) of at space gauge theory but now with the space-time operation

r acting on the world-volume coordinates as well.
if we start with an n -dimensional
representation  this will lead to a u (n ) gauge theory on the quotient space t 6/ with

specic boundary conditions. depending on the choice of representation.

the 06 strings in our problem will then give fermionic elds  satisfying the projection

((6)(g))1(0)(g) = r(g).

(6.1)

in fact r(g) = 1 here (in contrast to the vertex operators v () we discussed earlier which
do transform under u (1)3 rotations). this is clear because the ramond states must form

a representation of the so(6) rotating the dn directions before applying the orbifolding;

as is well known this is a singlet representation.

19

let us briey discuss the case without discrete torsion rst (we will return to this

elsewhere). we rst note that in contrast to the 0-branes it is more reasonable to call the

object with n = 1 the elementary 6-brane since its world-volume theory is u (1) gauge

theory on the quotient space. both it and the fractional 0-brane will carry one-dimensional

representations of  and the projection (6.1) implies that only if the two branes carry the

same representation  will a 0-6 string survive: we have nai = a,i in this basis. thus the
dirac condition is saturated if we include the n = 1 6-branes.

for the case with discrete torsion, the minimal theory then takes (0) = (6) = 1, an
n n representation, to describe a fractional 0-brane and an elementary 6-brane. a single
component   1 survives the projection and we conclude that these two objects satisfy
the dirac condition with the minimal ux quantum.

however, the striking feature of this elementary 6-brane is that it is a u (n) gauge

theory on the quotient manifold, not a u (1) theory, since 1 is an n-dimensional repre-
sentation. as we commented above, the equations (3.1) have a solution for generic u (n)
gauge elds in one fundamental region t 6/; they simply determine the corresponding

elds in the other fundamental regions.

thus the nal resolution of our paradox turns out to be that, in the case with discrete

torsion, the elementary 6-brane is actually an n-fold bound state, in the sense that it

carries u (n) gauge elds.

7. conclusions and further questions

we derived d-brane gauge theories for c3/zzn zzn orbifolds with discrete torsion and
studied the moduli space of a d-brane at a point (say a d0 in iia). we were able to nd
a simple exact equation for this moduli space as a subvariety of c4. in agreement with

expectations the closed string moduli deform the moduli space and resolve the xed lines

but do not allow fully resolving the singularity.

however the detailed results for n > 2 conict with the intuition that discrete torsion,

being non-geometrical, had to be located at a particular singularity. instead we nd

n  1 conifold singularities separated (in complex parameter space) by o(), where  is

the scale of the resolution parameter.

was there any real basis for the intuition that discrete torsion would be concentrated

at one singularity? probably not. one argument against this is that, in the global context
(consider t 6/zz3  zz3 for example), the value of discrete torsion is not independently

20

adjustable at each of the singularities but rather is a global choice to be made for the

entire orbifold. from this point of view any number of singularities might have appeared

in the resolution with discrete torsion being a global invariant not necessarily detectable

at any one of them.

we also found fractional branes which are bps and carry a conserved zzn quantum

number. some of their properties are consistent with the idea that these are p + 2-branes

wrapped about a zero volume torsion 2-cycle of the type suggested in [11]. other properties

 there are two elementary fractional branes distinguished by a non-topological quantum

number, and the annihilation of n branes to a regular brane encounters a potential barrier

 are rather peculiar.

the t 6/zz2  zz2 model is mirror to the same orbifold without discrete torsion. since
this can be completely resolved, this should provide a geometrical picture of the fractional

branes in terms of 3-branes. presumably the potential barrier would mean that a su-
persymmetric t 3 cycle (mirror to the d0) is homologous to a sum of n supersymmetric
cycles without moduli (say s3s) but that they are connected only by deforming through

non-supersymmetric cycles.

the fractional branes carry charge 1/n yet satisfy the dirac quantization condition;
related to this, the elementary conjugate 6  p-brane is a bound state in the sense that
its world-volume theory is a u (n) gauge theory.

it will be quite interesting to make contact between these results and the k-theory

description of d-brane charge, and to develop either a geometrical interpretation of discrete

torsion or perhaps a noncommutative geometric description.

appendix a.

in this appendix we prove that on the moduli space of our u (n) gauge theory, when
all  6= 0, any gauge invariant polynomial i can be written as a polynomial in terms of
mii..i and m123: i = pi (m11...1, m22...2, m33...3, m123; i). this means that the moduli
space is a subvariety of c4 dened by polynomial equations, which could be obtained in

21

principle by nding a complete set of relations between gauge invariants and substituting

these linear relations.

the simplest relation comes from taking the trace of the f-atness conditions (3.10):

mij = k.

the idea is, given some invariant mi1i2..., to use the deformed f-atness conditions
(3.10) and the cyclic property of the trace, to shift around one of the indices, until the

original ordering is recovered. if this comes with a phase, we can express the invariant in

terms of lower degree invariants. the simplest example will illustrate the general method.

1(cid:0)12  121(cid:1) = 31  m112  1m121 = 3m1 
(cid:0)1  1(cid:1) m112 = 3m1  m112 = m1m12

.

another example (which we leave as an exercise for the idle reader) is that miijj = mijij =
m 2
ij.

however, this method does not work for every invariant. for invariants with all indices

equal, as m11..1, the method does not even apply. this is not the only case for which the
method fails to express an invariant in term of lower degree invariants: if mij..k has charge
(n1, n2, n3), then when n1  n2  n2  n3  n3  n1  0 (n)  i.e. n1  n2  n3 (n)  we
obtain instead an identity involving only lower degree invariants. for example, for n > 2

n 2m122133 (cid:0)1 + 1(cid:1) 3m1233 =

m112233 = e 2i
= m112233 +(cid:0)1 + 1(cid:1) (2m1223  3m1233)
 2m1223 = 3m1233

so using this method we fail to express m112233 in terms of lower degree polynomials, but
instead obtain a relation between lower degree polynomials.

at this point our list of potentially independent polynomials on the moduli space

consists of all the polynomials of the form mii.i, and the polynomials m11..122..233..3 with
n1  n2  n3(n). to obtain more relations we assume that our matrices are n dimensional
and use the cayley-hamilton theorem. this states that a matrix  will solve the equation

p() = 0

(a.1)

where p(x) is the characteristic polynomial of , a polynomial of degree n whose coe-
cients are polynomial in tr k for k  n. the simplest proof follows from the fact that
diagonalizable matrices are a dense subset.

22

since (a.1) is a matrix relation we have

tr ap() = 0

(a.2)

for any matrix polynomial a. this shows that any invariant of degree greater than n with

n repeated indices can be written in terms of lower degree invariants. this reduces our list

of potentially independent invariants to mii..i with up to n indices plus m123123..123 with
strictly less than 3n indices.

we can do even better. now we are going to argue that the situation is the following:

for generic values of mii..i, when the relation n

1 m11..1

= n

2 m22..2

= n

3 m33..3

is not

satised, we can prove that m ii..i

= 0 for k < n. on the other hand, in the special case

|{z}n

|{z}n

|{z}n

when that relation is satised, mii..i for k < n need not to be zero, (and indeed it is not
zero for some solutions), but we nonetheless argue that mii..i can only take a nite number
of values, so they cannot parametrize a continuous direction.

to start with, one can very easily prove that

. using (a.3) we obtain n  1 equations for mii..i, and this

finally, we have to deal with the polynomials of the kind m123..123. we can not apply
(a.2) as it stands, since we have argued that for generic values of i, mii..i = 0 for k < n, so
the cayley-hamilton theorem reduces to n
i m11..1i = 0. if we consider the characteristic
polynomial of 12 it does not work neither. if we consider the characteristic polynomial
of 123 and take a = 1, 2
1..., we obtain relations for these polynomials. for instance,
for n = 3 we obtain

m123123 = m 2

123 + 2(1  )m12m31m23

(a.5)

so for generic values of mij we see that m123..123 is also determined in terms of
lower degree polynomials. this concludes our argument that on the moduli space, all the
non-zero gauge invariant polynomials can be written in terms of 4 polynomials: m11..1

to prove that n
