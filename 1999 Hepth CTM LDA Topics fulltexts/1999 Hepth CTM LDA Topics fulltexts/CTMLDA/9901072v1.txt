abstract

various aspects of the nahm equations in 3 and 7 dimensions are
investigated. the residues of the variables at simple poles in the 7-
dimensional case form an algebra. a large class of matrix representa-
tions of this algebra is constructed. the large n limit of these equa-
tions is taken by replacing the commutators by moyal brackets, and a
set of non trivial solutions in a generalised form of wigner distribution
functions is obtained.

1 introduction

when the study of self dual gauge elds was very fashionable, there was some
interest in extending the theory to higher dimensions [1][2][3]. in recent years
interest in this subject has been revived [4] partly because of the occurrence
of yang mills gauge actions in the m(atrix) theory approximation to string
theories [5][6][7]. the present article is a study of a class of solutions to
the nahm equations [8] in 7-dimensions, which are a particular form of the
self dual yang-mills equations in euclidean 8-dimensional space, where the
gauge elds a,  = 1 . . . 7 depend only upon the 8th co-ordinate,  and we
work in a gauge where a8 = 0. these equations take the form

a1
  [a2, a7]  [a6, a3]  [a5, a4] = 0
a2
  [a7, a1]  [a5, a3]  [a4, a6] = 0
a3
  [a1, a6]  [a2, a5]  [a4, a7] = 0
a4
  [a1, a5]  [a6, a2]  [a7, a3] = 0
a5
  [a4, a1]  [a3, a2]  [a6, a7] = 0
a6
  [a3, a1]  [a2, a4]  [a7, a5] = 0
a7
  [a1, a2]  [a3, a4]  [a5, a6] = 0

(1)

the sum of the squares of the left hand sides of these equations give the
lagrangian density for yang mills theory in 8-dimensions dependent only
upon  in the gauge a8 = 0, up to divergence terms. this is just the
bogomolnyi property of the equations (1). alternatively, the equations may
be iterated to obtain the equations of motion for the yang mills eld. note
that when the  dependence of a is a simple pole, then the equations for the
residues are just algebraic. the rst objective of this paper is to initiate a
study of the algebraic solution to such equations. it is known that a solution
to (1) takes the form

ai = 1
2

ei

i = 1 . . . 7

(2)

2

where the ei form a basis for the imaginary octonions, but since these do
not possess a matrix representation, as they are non-associative, one might
wonder whether a matrix valued solution exists. indeed many such solutions
exist, and we determine the allowable  dependence of some of them. we nd
a particular solution, modelled upon the structure constants for octonionic
multiplication and a more general solution in the form of a direct sum of
su(2) representations.

the second objective of this paper is to consider the innite limit of the
nahm equations in both 3 and 7-dimensions in the limit of large n for the
gauge group su(n). the motivation for this is a possible application to
in this case the matrices a go over
string theory and matrix models.
to functions x (x, p) on phase space (x, p). the matrix elements may be
regarded as the fourier components of x . the commutator goes over to
the moyal bracket [9]. this we recall is the antisymmetric part of the star
product, which acts on functions in phase space (x, p). the star product of
two functions f (x, p) and g(x, p) is dened as

f (x, p)  g(x, p) = f (x, p)ei(xp px )g(x, p)

(3)

where  is a parameter. the moyal bracket is proportional to the antisym-
metric part of the star product and so the moyal bracket of two functions
f (x, p) and g(x, p) is written as

{f, g}m b =

1
2i

(f  g  g  f )

(4)

it is the unique one parameter associative deformation of the poisson bracket
[10][11][12]. as n = 2
 passes through the odd integers the moyal bracket
{x , x }m b degenerates into an innite direct sum of copies of the com-
mutator [a, a], where a, a are su(n) matrices, the large n limit of
which is the poisson bracket

{x , x }p b =

x 
x

x 
p 

x 
p

x 
x

.

(5)

the square of this quantity is just the schild [13][14] form of the string
lagrangian, giving the same classical equations of motion as does the nambu-
goto string. thus the large n limit of the yang mills lagrangian in the
strong coupling limit, where it is simply proportional to the square of the

3

trace of the commutator, is equivalent to the string lagrangian [14]. this
may be viewed as a primitive form of a type of maldacena conjecture [15],
relating a eld theory in the large n limit to a string theory. the phase
space co-ordinates x, p are to be interpreted as co-ordinate parametrisations
on the world-sheet of the string. the idea had been advanced that the target
space co-ordinates x  (d0 branes ) may be represented by a generalised form
of the wigner function familiar from quantum mechanics [16][17]. we shall
demonstrate solutions of the moyal-nahm equations (where the commutators
are replaced by moyal brackets) which take the form of a generalised wigner
function.

2 7-d nahm equations

the equations (1) can be written more succinctly with the aid of totally an-
tiysmmetric structure constants cijk which, in fact, dene the multiplication
table of octonions of dierent index;

ei  ej = cijkek

(6)

in the same was as the ijk symbol does for the quaternions. the nahm
equations may then be written in the form

ai


=

1
2

cijk[aj, ak]

with a solution for the residues bi of the simple poles in ai = 
by

bi = cijk

(7)

(8)

an explicit set of matrices bi is listed in the appendix. no more general 
dependent solution of this type has been found. however, a very large class of
solutions whose matrices take the form of a direct sum of representations of
the su(2) algebra, but which are nevertheless not reducible, with non-trivial
 dependence does exist and we proceed to explain their construction. let

it is somewhat surprising to nd that this solution involves three arbitrary
parameters, yet none of these parameters can be set to zero in such a way that
the solution remains faithful and irreducible. obviously many such solutions
of direct sum form can be constructed where the s in each row can be
replaced by representations of su(2) of arbitrary dimension. in particular,
a representation of the nahm algebra with 4  4 matrices can be found, by
simply ommitting the last two rows in the above matrices (9). our next task
will be to search for the presence of solutions with non-trivial  dependence.
an attempt was made to nd a solution to the nahm equations using the
matrices bi (setting a = 1, b = 1, c = 1). each of these matrices was
multiplied by a function of  , fi( ). therefore,

ai = fi( )bi

i = 1, . . . , 7

(10)

however this ansatz is not suciently exible and the previous result, fi( ) =
 1
2 is all that is recovered. a more general ansatz for a solution is to multiply
each matrix bi by a diagonal matrix ci given by

ci = 


0
0

fi( )ll

0

gi( )ll

0
0

0

hi( )ll




(11)

(this amounts to multiplying each  matrix entry in each matrix bi by
a dierent  dependent function.)
it is easiest to consider each row of 
matrices separately. first, we shall look at the top row of sigma matrices
and put in the  dependence by multiplying each matrix by a function fi( ).
putting these 2 x 2 matrices into the nahm equations gives the following set

3 moyal-nahm equations

consider a eld x k (k=0,1,2,3) in four dimensions where x k depends upon
only one co-ordinate (in this case t) and phase space (x, p). the gauge is
xed so x 0 is a constant. the moyal nahm equations in three dimensions
are:

x 1
t
x 2
t
x 3
t

= {x 2, x 3}m b
= {x 3, x 1}m b
= {x 1, x 2}m b

(19)

if the moyal brackets were to be replaced by commutators and the functions
x k(t, x, p) were replaced by matrices x k(t) then the equations would become

7

the nahm equations for a self dual eld. the main idea to solve these
moyal-nahm equations is to use the following ansatz:

x i = iz 




j (x  y, t)ijkk(x + y, t)e2ipy/dy

(20)

where (x, t) are three component wave functions. these wave functions
were chosen to be of the following form:

(x, t) = 


1(x, t)
2(x, t)
3(x, t)




= 


f1(t)1(x)
f2(t)2(x)
f3(t)3(x)




(21)

where the i(x) are orthonormal wave functions. the star product of x j and
x k is calculated as follows:

x j  x k = zz 

i (x  y, t)jill(x + y, t)e2ipy/ 
m(x  y, t)kmnn(x + y, t)e2ipy/dydy


= zz 

i (x  y + y, t)jill(x + y + y, t)e2ipy/
m(x  y  y, t)kmnn(x + y  y, t)e2ipy/dydy


=

m(x  y, t)kmnz(t)jill(x + y, t)e2ipy/dy

= 

1

2 z 

m(x  y)f 

ms(t)ksnz(t)jirfrl(t)l(x + y)e2ipy/dy

where orthogonality of the k(x) is assumed to be of the form

z 





j(x)k(x)dx = jk

and

z(t) = f f

where f =

f1(t)

f2(t)

f3(t)

(22)

the partial derivative x i

t can be written as

x i
t

= iz 

j(x  y)


t

(f (t)ijkf (t))k(x + y)e2ipy/dy.

(25)

by putting these into the moyal-nahm equations one obtains three matrix

equations of the form

i


t

(f (t)1f (t)) = 1
4i

(f (t)3z(t)2f (t)  f (t)2z(t)3f (t))

(26)

where i is a 3 x 3 matrix with jkth entry ijk. equating the entries in the
matrices gives dierential equations of the form


t

(f 

(f

3 f2) = 

1
4|f1|2(f 
1
4|f1|2(f 

2 f3)

3 f2)

(27)

and cycle combinations of these. these can be used to create the following
set of three dierential equations.


t

t

t

2|f1|2|f2|2|f3|2
(|f2|2|f3|2) =

2|f1|2|f2|2|f3|2
(|f3|2|f1|2) = 
1
(|f1|2|f2|2) = 
2|f1|2|f2|2|f3|2.

(28)

note that for each of the above, the right hand side of the equations is always
the same.

3.1 simplest solution

the simplest solution is to set all the fi equal to each other. this gives the
solution

(29)

(30)

so that

|f1|2 = |f2|2 = |f3|2 =

f1(t) = f2(t) = f3(t) =

where k is an arbitrary constant.

9

4

t + k

2

t + k

3.2 another simple solution

by setting two of the fi equal to each other then a solution in terms of the
hyperbolic functions can be found.

|f1|2 = |f2|2 = 4q coth(qt + k)
|f3|2 = 8q csch(2qt + 2k)

so that

f1(t) = f2(t) = 2qq coth(qt + k)

f3(t) = 2q2q csch(2qt + 2k)

where k and q are both real constants.

(31)

(32)

3.3 general solution

however, ideally we want a general solution to these equations. in this case
the solutions are written in terms of elliptic functions sn, cn and dn. the
most general solution was found to be:

|f1|2 = 4qksn(qt + c)
|f2|2 = 2qksn(qt + c) +
|f3|2 = 2qksn(qt + c) +

2q(dn(qt + c)cn(qt + c) + 1)

sn(qt + c)

2q(dn(qt + c)cn(qt + c)  1)

sn(qt + c)

(33)

k, q, and c are all constants but may have to be carefully chosen in order to
ensure that all the |fi|2 are positive. k depends on the elliptic functions.
a more aesthetically pleasing form of solution is as follows:

|f1|2 = 4qk2 sn(qt + c)cn(qt + c)
|f2|2 = 4q
|f3|2 = 4q

cn(qt + c)dn(qt + c)

dn(qt + c)sn(qt + c)

cn(qt + c)

dn(qt + c)

sn(qt + c)

(34)

q,c and k are all constants. again, k depends on the elliptic functions.

4 7d moyal equations

the moyal nahm equations in seven dimensions are:

x 1
t
x 2
t
x 3
t
x 4
t
x 5
t
x 6

x 7

= {x 2, x 7}m b + {x 6, x 3}m b + {x 5, x 4}m b
= {x 7, x 1}m b + {x 5, x 3}m b + {x 4, x 6}m b
= {x 1, x 6}m b + {x 2, x 5}m b + {x 4, x 7}m b
= {x 1, x 5}m b + {x 6, x 2}m b + {x 7, x 3}m b
= {x 4, x 1}m b + {x 3, x 2}m b + {x 6, x 7}m b
= {x 3, x 1}m b + {x 2, x 4}m b + {x 7, x 5}m b
= {x 1, x 2}m b + {x 3, x 4}m b + {x 5, x 6}m b

(35)

the set of matrices bi can also be used to nd a solution to the equations
(35).using the ansatz

(x  y,  )bi(x + y,  )e2ipy/dy
where (x, t) are six component wave functions of the form



ai = iz 

j = fj( )(x)j,

j not summed

(36)

(37)

we nd a rather simple solution in terms of this ansatz of the form

{f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6} =
2k1ei2
2k1ei1
ek1  1
1  ek1

all ki and j are constants.

the previous solution used the two-dimensional  matrix representation
of su(2). if instead the three dimensional representation of su(2), which
involves the completely antisymmetric matrices ijk, is used to construct the

11

bi a more general  dependent solution can be found along similar lines to
that in section 3. this time the matrices bi were taken to be

b1 =   3 0
b5 =   2 0

0 3! , b2 =   1 0
0 i3! , b6 =   i3 0

0 2! , b3 =   3 0
0 1! , b7 =   2 0

0 2! , b4 =   i2 0
0 i2! .

0 3! ,

(38)

where the jkth entry of the matrix i is given by the totally antisymmtric
tensor ijk.

the same ansatz (36)(37) was used as before but with the new bi matri-
ces. the  dependent functions fi were found to be of the same form as the
solution to the 3d moyal nahm equations when solved using  matrices (34).
they are as follows

dn(q + c)

|f1|2 = 4qk2 sn(q + c)cn(q + c)
|f2|2 = 4q
|f3|2 = 4q

cn(q + c)dn(q + c)

dn(q + c)sn(q + c)

cn(q + c)

sn(q + c)

,

dn(q + b)

, |f4|2 = 4qk 2 sn(q + b)cn(q + b)
, |f5|2 = 4q
|f6|2 = 4q

cn(q + b)dn(q + b)

dn(q + b)sn(q + b)

cn(q + b)

sn(q + b)

. (39)

these solutions can be extended for direct sums of more than two i matrices.

appendix

the following 7 x 7 matrices which solve the nahm algebra are created using
the octonionic structure constants cijk which are taken to be:

c127 = c631 = c541 = c532 = c246 = c347 = c567 = 1

(40)

these are totally antisymmetric. all other cijk are zero. the jkth entry of
the matrix mi is given by [mi]jk = cijk.
