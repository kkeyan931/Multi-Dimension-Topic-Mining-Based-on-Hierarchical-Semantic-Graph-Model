introduction

the main goal of renormalization from a traditional point of view is to determine when

and how the cancellation of ultraviolet (uv) divergences in quantum eld theory occurs.

such a cancellation is essential if a theory has to yield quantitative physical predictions.

what is not obvious is how the quantum uctuations associated with extremely short

distances (i.e. very high momenta) can be so harmless to aect a theory only through

the values of a few of its parameters, typically the bare masses and coupling constants

or the counterterms in renormalized perturbation theory.

another picture for renormalization can be conceived, and the idea is due to k. wilson

[1]. he suggested that all of the parameters of a renormalizable eld theory can be thought

of as scale dependent objects and such a scale dependence is described by dierential

equations, the so-called renormalization group (rg) equations or ow equations. the

rg method is based on the functional integral approach to eld theory and the origin

of the ultraviolet (uv) divergences is perused by isolating in the functional integral the

short-distance degrees of freedom of the eld. actually in the generating functional z[j]

the basic integration variables are the fourier components (k) of the eld, namely z[j]

is expressed by

z[j] =z deir [l+j] = yk z d (k)! eir [l+j] .

in order to cure the ultraviolet divergences, a sharp uv cuto m is imposed. this means
we integrate only over the elds (k) with |k|  m and set (k) = 0 for |k|  m so that
in the real space the elds are dened on a lattice of spacing 2 /m. according to wilson,

the fundamental elds are replaced by their averages over a certain space-time volume

(blockspin transformations) and thus dened on a coarser lattice. by this averaging

process small scale uctuations which correspond to high frequencies are eliminated.

rather than in the discrete wilson rg, we are interested in the continuous wilsonian

rg [2]-[4]. the idea behind it is very similar to that of the discrete case: in the generating

4

contents

functional (partition function in the euclidean) we do not integrate over all momenta in

one go, but we rst integrate out modes between a cuto scale 0 (uv) and a very
much lower energy scale . what is left over integration between  and zero may

still be expressed as a generating functional but the bare action is replaced by a very
complicated eective action, se, containing an innite series of non-local terms. this
is naturally interpreted as the high frequency modes of the elds generating eective

couplings for the low-energy modes. however, we expect the behaviour at small scales to

be controlled only by a nite number of parameters, i.e. the relevant parameters (with

non-negative mass dimension). deviations from locality will be of order /0. thus,
when the relevant parameters have been xed at low energies, the dependence on 0 will
be given by powers of /0 at any order in perturbation theory. moreover, by requiring
the physical green functions to be independent of the cuto , it follows the functional
se obeys an evolution equation. hence, the evolution equation with a suitable set
of boundary conditions which encode both renormalizability and the renormalization

conditions can be thought of as an alternative denition of a theory.

from what we have seen so far we should be driven to view the rg formulation as a

natural setting for the analysis of eective theories [5]. eective theories are very popular

nowadays: chiral perturbation theory [6], heavy quark eective theory [7], low energy

n = 2 super yang mills [8] are just a few examples. even though the dream of modern

physics is to achieve a simple understanding of all the observed phenomena in terms

of some fundamental dynamics (unication), assuming a theory of everything appeared

at some point, the description of nature at all physical scales would have little to do

with a quantitative analysis at the most elementary level. therefore, in order to study a

particular physical system in a huge surrounding world, the key issue is to identify and

pick up the most appropriate variables.

usually, a physics problem involves widely separated energy scales. the basic idea

is to identify those parameters which are very large (small) compared with the energy

scale of the system and to set them to innity (zero). a sensible description of the

system would obviously consider the corrections induced by the neglected energy scales

as small perturbations. eective eld theories are the appropriate theoretical tool to

examine low-energy physics, where low is referred to some energy scale m (0 in the
rg). only the relevant degrees of freedom, i.e. the states with k << m are kept, whereas

the heavier excitations with k >> m are integrated out from the action. the by-

product of such integration is a bunch of non-renormalizable interactions among the

light states, which can be expanded in powers of e/m, e being the energy. thus the

contents

information on the heavier degrees of freedom is stored in the couplings of the low-energy

lagrangian. although an eective eld theory contains an innite number of interactions,

renormalizability can be trusted since, at a given order in the expansion in e/m (/0
in the rg), the low-energy theory is specied by a nite number of couplings.

we naturally expects the eective theory keeps track of the symmetries of the funda-

mental theory. global symmetries, such as lorentz invariance, isotopic spin invariance

and so on, are automatically maintained in the rg method. it is certainly not so for

gauge symmetries.

in fact the division of momenta into large or small (according to

some scale ) which is fundamental in the rg approach is not preserved by gauge

transformations, since in the momentum space the eld is mapped into a convolution

with the element of the gauge group. we are forced to conclude that the symmetry of

the fundamental theory is lost at the eective level. nevertheless, a remainder of the

original invariance survives in the form of an eective symmetry which constraints the

ow of all the couplings of the theory at the scale . unfortunately, the task of solving

the relations among the couplings coming from those constraints is impossible to carry

out, due to non-linearity. therefore one is left with two options: either work in non-

perturbative eld theory by means of an analytic approximation or solve equations in

the perturbative regime. in the former case we have to face the unpleasant aspect that

there is no known truncation consistent with gauge invariance and the best one can do

is to give a numerical estimate of the symmetry breaking term by using eective ward

identities [9]. in this thesis we will choose the latter option and the implementation of

symmetries in perturbation theory will be extensively treated.

even though the topics of the thesis will be discussed at the perturbative level, we must

recall for completeness that the rg formulation is in principle non perturbative. clearly

analytic approximation methods must be employed in non-perturbative quantum eld

theory where there are no small parameters to expand in. in this direction much progress

has been made. let us just mention the applications to chiral symmetry breaking, phase

transitions, nite temperature, large n limit and to many other sectors. for a review

see [10]. two major problems aect non-perturbative rg. of the rst of these, that any

known truncation violates gauge invariance, we have already said. the second problem

is the lack of a recipe to evaluate errors in a certain approximation scheme.

we now present the outline of the thesis.

in the rst chapter we will introduce

the wilsonian exact renormalization group for a general theory (i.e. containing both

bosons and fermions, scalars and vectors). the procedure of integrating out the modes
with frequency above 2 and below 2
0 will be performed multiplying the quadratic part

6

contents

of the classical action by a cuto function which is one between 2 and 2

0 and rapidly
vanishes outside this interval. we will then derive the rg ow by requiring the generating

functional of the theory to be independent of the infrared cuto .

as an example of how the rg method works, in chapter 2 we will apply it to the

massless scalar theory. we will see in details how an iterative solution of the ow equation,

together with a set af suitable boundary conditions, provides the usual loop expansion.

furthermore we will explicitly compute the one-loop two-point and four-point vertices.

for this theory we will also prove perturbative renormalizability, i.e. the existence of the
0   limit, and infrared niteness, that is the vertex functions at non-exceptional
momenta are nite order by order in perturbation theory.

the third chapter will be devoted to establishing the quantum action principle

(qap) in the rg and we will show that the slavnov-taylor (st) identities, which com-

pletely characterize the classical theory, can be directly formulated for the cuto eective

action at any . afterwards we will use these eective identities to x the couplings in

the bare action.

in the fourth chapter the qap will be exploited to analyse the breaking of dilata-

tion invariance occurring in the scalar theory in the rg approach. an analogue of the

callan-symanzik equation will be derived for the cuto eective action and from the

eective ward identities of dilatation the one-loop beta function for such a theory will

be reproduced.

in the fth chapter we will address su(n) yang-mills theory. after deriving the

evolution equation, we will treat the key issue of boundary conditions which, in this case,

have also to ensure restoration of symmetry for the physical theory when the cutos are
removed (in the limits   0 and 0   ). we will then use the eective st identities
to derive some of the bare couplings (ne-tuning) at the rst loop. the next step will

be the extension of the rg method to chiral gauge theory. this will be the subject of

chapter 6. since in the rg formulation the space-time dimension is four, there is no

ambiguity in the denition of the matrix 5 and in the regularized action left and right
fermions will not be coupled. therefore the solution of the ne-tuning procedure we

be simpler than in the standard case (global chiral symmetry is preserved) and will be

explicitly performed. we will then show how the chiral anomaly can be obtained in the

rg.

having gone through non-supersymmetric theories, chapter 7 will be dedicated to

extending the rg formulation to supersymmetric theories. regularization will be imple-

mented in such a way that supersymmetry is preserved. actually, it suces to write the

contents

7

classical action in terms of superelds and multiply the propagators by the same cuto

function. in components this corresponds to use the same cuto for all elds. we will

start with the wess-zumino model to set up the formalism and then, in chapter 8, we

will approach supersymmetric gauge theories. we will solve the ne-tuning equation at

the rst loop and show how the gauge anomaly can be derived. finally, the appendix

contains the supersymmetric conventions.

wilson renormalization group

1.1 wilson eective action

to start with, we will acquaint with the wilson renormalization group (rg) or exact

renormalization group formulation of a theory. the basic idea of wilson rg [1] is

to regard an interacting eld theory as an eective theory, that is to consider the high

frequency modes of the elds of the theory as generating eective couplings for the low

energy modes. in this picture one introduces an uv cuto 0 to make the green functions
of the theory nite in the ultraviolet region. then a scale  is introduced and the

frequencies between  and 0 are viewed as generating interactions for the frequencies
lower than .

as we will see throughout the following chapters, the rg approach can be applied to

a wide variety of theories, so that a general formulation is in order. to do so, we will
denote with a = {, , } the elds of the theory (the s are commuting elds while
the ,  are anticommuting, fermions or ghosts) and ja = {j, ,} the corresponding
1 is invariant
sources in the generating functional. let us suppose the classical action scl
under the innitesimal local transformation of the eld 

a(x) =  pa[(x)] ,

(1.1)

where the pa[] are (anticommuting) polynomials in the elds and  is an anticommuting
parameter. introducing the sources a, associated to the composite operators dening

1here we mean the classical action contains the gauge-xing term and the corresponding faddeev-

popov term.

10

the symmetry transformations of a, we can write the brs action

sbrs[, ] = scl[] +zx

a pa[] .

in order to quantize the theory one needs a regularization procedure of the ultraviolet

divergences. such divergences are regularized by assuming that in the path integral

only the elds with frequencies smaller then a given uv cuto 0 are integrated. this
procedure is equivalent to assume the free propagators vanish for p2 > 2
0. the generating

functional is

z[j, ] = eiw [j,] =z d exp i(cid:8) 1

2(, d1)00 + (j, )00 + sint[, ; 0](cid:9) ,

(1.2)

ab and, more generally, we have

(1.3)

the cuto function k0(p) is one for 2  p2  2
0 and rapidly vanishes outside this
interval and its introduction can be responsible for a possible loss of the symmetry. hence

the uv action sint must contain all possible local, renormalizable interactions which are
needed to compensate the symmetry breaking induced by the regularization.

according to wilson we integrate over the high energy modes, i.e. the elds with

frequencies 2 < p2 < 2

0 and obtain

z[j, ] = n[j, ; , 0] z d exp in 1

2(, d1)0 + (j, )0 + se[, ; , 0]o ,

(1.4)

where the coecient n is given by

log n[j, ; , 0] =

(j, dj)00 +

(j, dj)0 .

the functional se is the wilsonian eective action and contains the eective interaction
coming from the frequencies p2 > 2. we now prove that this functional is equivalent

to a generalization of (1.2), in which the free propagators contain  as an infrared cuto

[11, 12]. the generating functional (1.2) can be rewritten as

2 (1, d11)0 + (j, )0

(1.5)

n[j, ; , 0]z dd1 exp in 1

2 (, d1)0  1
+ sint[ + 1, ; 0]o ,

2summations over internal indices are understood.

1.1 wilson eective action

11

where

k00(p) = k0(p) + k0(p) .

this can be easily seen by performing the change of variables 1 =    in (1.5), which
gives

n[j, ; , 0] z d exp i{ 1

z d exp i{ 1

2 (, d1)0 + sint[, ; 0]}

(1.6)

2 (, d1)0  1

2(, d1)0 + (j1, )0 + (j, )0} ,

where the source j1(p) is

j1(p) = d1(p) (p) .

then we carry out the integration over the eld , which is gaussian, and get (1.2).
on the other hand, by integrating over the eld  in equation (1.6) we get back the
denition of the wilsonian eective action se given in (1.4).

the comparison between (1.4) and (1.6) provides us with a further denition of se

2 (, d1)0 + se[, ; , 0]}

exp i{ 1
=z d exp i{ 1

2(, d1)0 + (j , )0 + sint[, ; 0]} ,

where the source is

j (p) = d1(p) (p) .

(1.7)

(1.8)

finally, (1.2) and (1.7) put together allow us to see the functional se in a new per-
spective, that is to say as a generator of the connected green functions apart for the

tree-level two-point functions in which the internal propagators have frequencies in the
range 2 < p2 < 2

0. in other words, the functional 3

ba (p)

(1.9)

is the generating functional of the connected amputated cuto green function, since the
factor k 1
0 d1 in w cancels out the external free propagators of the green functions.

3here and in the following we explicitly write only the dependence on the cuto , since we expect

the theory to be renormalizable and we are interested in the limit 0   .

12

wilson renormalization group

1.2 the rg ow

by integrating out the modes over a xed scale  we have come to the denition of the
eective action se. if we consider such an action as pertaining to a low-energy theory,
we are naturally driven to analyse the evolution of se in the infrared cuto .

the requirement that the generating functional (1.4) is independent of the ir cuto 

gives rise to a dierential equation for the wilsonian eective action, the so-called exact

rg equation [1, 2, 4]

(1.11)

this equation can be more easily understood taking into account that  enters as an ir

cuto in the internal propagators of the cuto green functions. furthermore, it is non-

perturbative and, together with a set of suitable boundary conditions, can be thought as

an alternative denition of the theory.

as far as one is concerned with its perturbative solution, the usual loop expansion is

recovered by solving iteratively (1.10) or (1.11). the solution of (1.10) is possible since the
evolution equation for the vertex sn(p1, p2,   , pn) of se at a given loop  involves lower
loop vertices or, at worse, vertices sm of the same order but with m < n. therefore,
in order to perform any perturbative study a ltration [13] (i.e. the introduction of a

eld-counting operator) in the space of vertices is required and the analysis at any loop

order must be done by starting from the vertices with lower number of external elds.

unfortunately this twinned recursive procedure in the perturbative order and in the

number of elds proves rather cumbersome. we can get rid of those troublesome

vertices of the same loop order by realizing they are 1p-reducible and so disappear in the

analysis of the generator of the cuto 1pi functions.

as one expects, from a technical point of view it is simpler to study the legendre

transform of w [j, ; ]

[, ; , 0] = w [j, ; , 0] zp

j ,

(1.12)

which we call cuto eective action and is a generalization of the usual quantum

eective action, since it contains the infrared cuto  in the free propagators [14, 11, 12].

1.2 the rg ow

13

the functional  generates the cuto vertex functions in which the internal propagators
have frequencies in the range 2 < p2 < 2
0 and reduces to the physical quantum eective
action in the limits   0 and 0   . in the following we will show in the scalar case
that both these limits can be taken in perturbation theory [2, 4, 11]. for this reason the

dependence on the ultraviolet cuto 0 has been understood.

the evolution equation for the functional [, ; ] can be derived from (1.11) by
jj . this inversion can be performed isolating

using (1.12) and inverting the functional 2w
the full two-point contributions 2 in the functional [, ; ]

which gives  in terms of the proper vertices of . the grassmannian parity a is one for
a fermionic eld and zero otherwise and the factor ()b has been introduced to take into
account the possible anti-commuting nature of the elds. a graphical representation of
the functional  is given in g. 1.
finally, inserting (1.13) in (1.11) and using (1.14), we obtain the evolution equation for

represent the functionals  and int, respectively. the dot indicates a cuto full propagator.

in this case a perturbative solution of (1.16) is simpler since the l.h.s. at a given loop

order depends only on lower loop vertices.

in order to integrate the rg equations either (1.10) or (1.16) we have to sup-

ply the boundary conditions. for this reason it is useful to distinguish between relevant

couplings and irrelevant vertices according to their mass dimension. one performs a tay-

lor expansion of the cuto vertices around vanishing momenta or around non-vanishing

subtraction points in case there are massless elds (to avoid infrared divergences). the

coecients of decreasing dimension appearing in the expansion are the couplings of the

theory. the relevant part is obtained by keeping the terms with coecients having

non-negative dimension (relevant couplings)

(1.18)

with such a denition, in the 0   limit the two-point function does not contain
the cuto function. should instead the relevant part of the cuto eective action be

given, we should isolate it only from the interaction part since the two-point function of

[, ; ] contains the cuto function. the couplings i() can be expressed either in

given subtraction point when massless elds are present. when this is the case, for the

the remaining part of the cuto eective action is called irrelevant. since we expect
the theory to be renormalizable, for   0 the dimension of the irrelevant couplings
should be given only by negative powers of 0. thus the simplest boundary condition
for the irrelevant part of the cuto eective action is

irr[, ;  = 0] = 0 .

(1.20)

for  = 0, then, the cuto eective action becomes local and corresponds to the bare
action sint in (1.2).

the relevant couplings are naturally set in the infrared, when most of the degrees

of freedom have been integrated out (in particular at the physical point  = 0, where

the cuto eective action becomes the physical one, so that the relevant couplings are

related to measurable quantities).

in the usual eld theory language this corresponds

giving the physical renormalization conditions. in the language of the wilson rg, this

means that the ow in the infrared is controlled by the relevant couplings. in this way

some of the relevant couplings are related to physical couplings such as the wave function

normalizations and the couplings gi at a subtraction point . the remaining are xed
imposing the symmetry at the physical point. this procedure is highly not trivial since

one has to analyse non-local functionals. alternatively we can discuss the symmetry at

the ultraviolet scale and determine i( = 0). in this case the discussion is simpler, since
all functionals are relevant, but we have to perform a perturbative calculation (i.e. to

solve the rg equations) to obtain the physical couplings. notice that while the physical

couplings are independent of the cuto function, the bare action is generally not.

(2.11)

notice (2.9) and (2.10) involve vertices at the infrared cuto  with a pair of exceptional
momenta q and q. for   0 these vertices become singular since we are dealing with a
massless theory. furthermore, when integrating on q = pi pi (i  subset of the pis),
we encounter vertices with exceptional momenta. we will soon analyse the limit   
and show that eqs. (2.9), (2.10) allow to derive vertex functions 2n with non-exceptional
momenta at the physical point  = 0, order by order in perturbation theory.

2.1.1 physical couplings and boundary conditions

in order to solve the rg ow for the scalar theory we need to supply boundary conditions.

dimensional analysis suggests us the form of the relevant part of the cuto eective action

and correspond, for  = 0, to the physical couplings introduced in (2.1). we then isolate

the relevant couplings in the two- and four-point vertices

(p2; ) = p21() + 2() + 2(p2; ) ,

4(p1, p2, p3, p4; ) = 3() + 4(p1, p2, p3, p4; ) ,

(2.12)

where, by denition, the vertices i satisfy the conditions

2(0; ) = 0 ,

1  3  ()0 ,
2  4  ()2 .

4(p1, p2, p3, p4; )|4sp = 0 .

2  ()2 ,

notice that in 2(p2; ) four powers of momentum are absorbed by the p-dependence
required by the two conditions at p2 = 0 and p2 = 2. similarly in 4 two powers of
momentum are absorbed by the pi-dependence required by the condition at the symmetric
point. in both cases the remnant has an inverse power dependence on , so that these

vertices, just as 2n with n > 2, are irrelevant.

we have already stressed so far the need of boundary conditions to get the vertex

functions from the evolution equations (2.9), (2.10). the conditions for the relevant

couplings i() must be such to ensure the physical normalization conditions, i.e. the
masslessness of our particle and the value of the self-coupling (g). thus at the physical

value  = 0 we impose

1( = 0) = 0 ,

2( = 0) = 0 ,

3( = 0) = g .

(2.13)

the further sensible physical requirement for the remaining vertex functions is that they

are negligible when the ultraviolet cuto 0 is set to innity. the simplest choice is to
set all these irrelevant vertices to zero at  = 0

2(p2; 0) = 0 ,

4(p1, p2, p3, p4; 0) = 0 ,

2n(p1,   , p2n; 0) = 0 ,

the subtractions in 4 and 6 follow from isolating in eq. (2.12) the relevant couplings
in the two- and four-eld vertices and from the dierent boundary conditions (2.13),

(2.14). we expect they provide the necessary subtractions to make the vertex functions
nite for 0   at any order in perturbation theory.

we should notice the role of the boundary conditions for the relevant couplings at
 = 0 and for the irrelevant vertices at  = 0   (see (2.15) and (2.16)). in the
case of the relevant couplings they act in such a way the q-integration is bounded from

above by . this is a crucial requisite to obtain a nite result since, as expected from
dimensional counting, the integrands grow with q2. hence the bare couplings, recovered

by setting  = 0, grow with 0 and provide the counterterms of the lagrangian (2.3)
in terms of the physical coupling g. on the other hand for the other vertices the q-

integration is bounded from above by the ultraviolet cuto 0.
in order to show the
theory is renormalizable, we must prove that as q2   the vertices in the integrands in
(2.16) vanish suciently fast to allow the limit 0   .

if we choose a sharp cuto like a step function eq. (2.11) reads

with k(q) = 1 for q2  2 and vanishing for q2 < 2. clearly the limit   0 can be

it is easy to see the integral is convergent for large q2. although at the physical value

eective potential resulting of summing up the vertex functions at vanishing momenta

is infrared nite. we rederive here the one-loop eective potential v () to illustrate the

role of the regularization and the physical conditions (2.1) in this framework. apart from
a volume factor, v () corresponds to [] with the classical eld (p) = (2)4 4(p) .

2.2 perturbative renormalizability

25

this expression is free from infrared singularities in q = 0 and the integral is convergent

at large q (see ref. [19]).

afterwards, using the previous results, we could go further and compute the vertex

functions at the two-loop order and so on. this was done in [11].

instead, we will

concentrate on proving the perturbative renormalizability and infrared niteness of the

theory.

2.2 perturbative renormalizability

the aim of this section is to prove that the theory is perturbative renormalizable, namely
that in (2.16) we can set 0   . to be rigorous, we should study the 0 dependence
of the integral equations and prove the existence of the limit via the cauchy criterion,

as was done in [2, 4, 20, 24]. what we want to do here is to be less rigorous and
stress the role of dimensional analysis by performing the limit 0   in the integral
equations and showing by induction that the equations so derived produce nite vertex

functions in perturbation theory. this is the reason why the dependence on the uv

cuto 0 has been understood so far and will be understood. as shown before, the
loop expansion develops from iterating eqs. (2.15) and (2.16). from the vertices ()
2n
we can construct the integrands at the same order which give the next loop vertices
upon q-integration. the convergence of the integrals producing (+1)
2n will be ensured by
dimensional counting, while showing 2 and 4 are nite will require the subtractions in
4 and 6 introduced in (2.17). the best way to represent the subtracted vertices 4
and 6 consists in a taylor expansion as for the bogoliubov r operators [21]. since we
are interested in the large  behaviour we will expand around vanishing momenta. only

even derivatives need being considered as odd derivative terms vanish due to symmetry,
either directly or after integration. the subtracted vertex 6 is obtained from the
expansion

6(q, p1,   , p4,q; ) = 6(q, 0,   , 0,q; )

(2.23)

where  = /p. notice that also the second term can be expressed in terms of fourth

derivatives of 4. similarly the integrand for 1 can be expressed as the second derivative
of 4 with respect to the momentum components.

in order to prove the theory is perturbatively renormalizable we have to analyse the

behaviour for large  of the vertices in the integrands and show the integration over  is
convergent for    (the convergence of the integrals for   0 will be discussed in
the next section). in this analysis we are not interested in the detailed dependence of the

vertices on the external momenta, except for the fact that the integration momentum is
xed at q2 = 2 (see (2.18)). to prove perturbative renormalizability it will suce, as in

[2], to bound the large  behaviour of the vertices in which all external momenta do not

exceed the cuto. then let us introduce the following function which depends only on 

|f2n|  p2

where c is some numerical constant and f (p1,   , pn; ) is 2n, 2n+2 or one of their
derivatives. iterating (2.15) and (2.16) in which we have previously set 0   , we
obtain the following bounds:

we should notice that the powers of  in (2.34)-(2.36) are independent of the loop number

since they are dictated by dimensional counting. as in the case of the relevant (irrelevant)

couplings the integrands increase (decrease) with , the integrals are dominated by the

upper (lower) limit  = . for the irrelevant couplings we can thus take the limit
0   , removing the ultraviolet cuto. it is easy to see that the integrals in (2.25)-
(2.33) reproduce at loop +1 the same dimensional counting behaviours. this is just what

28

the massless scalar case

we need to prove perturbative renormalizability, since logarithmic corrections cannot

change power counting at any nite order. in fact it is relatively simple to control also

the powers of t and in the following we show that the behaviours (2.34)-(2.36) are

reproduced by the iteration.

before discussing the large  behaviours at loop +1, from (2.34)-(2.36) we will derive

some intermediate results for the integrands at loop .

a) from the two-point function and (2.18) we have

tribution of g. 5 when the derivatives act on the internal propagators

2.3 infrared behaviour

in this section we show that for the massless scalar theory we are considering the vertex

functions at non-exceptional momenta are nite order by order in perturbation theory
[11]. for a general analysis of the behaviour in the   0 limit of vertex functions at
exceptional momenta see refs. [22, 23]. our aim is to prove that q integration in (2.15) and
(2.16) is convergent in the limit   0. as we have done in the case of renormalizability,
this is shown by induction in the number of loops.

the integrands in (2.15) and (2.16) are given by vertices with one pair (q,q) of
exceptional momenta. thus, by iteration, one introduces vertices with any number of

soft (i.e. of order ) exceptional momenta.
in general we say that a momentum pi
in 2n(p1,   , p2n; ) is exceptional if pi = o(). henceforth we will add the vertex
functions an index to identify the number of exceptional momenta. we write

2n,s(p1,   , p2n; )  2n(p1,   , p2n; ) ,

for

pi1 ,   pis = o() .

where s = 0, . . . , 2n  1. clearly for s = 2n  1 all pairs of momenta are exceptional and
we denote with 2n,0 the vertices without exceptional momenta. a similar notation will
be employed for the auxiliary vertices 2n+2,s with s soft momenta.

(i) assumptions at loop 

as   0 we assume the following behaviours

(2.42)

where t = ln(/). all these assumptions are satised for  = 0 and  = 1 (see sect.

2.1.1). anyway it is the rst equation that states the most important result and it is

our aim to show it holds even at loop  + 1. this is the reason why we need all other

behaviours in the assumptions, and those in turn must be satised at loop  + 1.

(ii) auxiliary vertices at loop 

30

the massless scalar case

(a) for the auxiliary vertices with just two soft momenta the sum in (2.7) is controlled,
as   0, by the proper vertex, giving

(2.43)

powers of t do not appear if the two soft momenta are inserted in dierent vertices or in

vertices without soft momenta of order .

(b) for an arbitrary even number of soft momenta (s > 0) we nd

(2.44)

this behaviour is controlled by the largest number of internal propagators with soft

momentum of order , i.e. by the contribution of the graph depicted in g. 6 in which

the 2s soft momenta are all emitted by the four-point vertices to the left (or right). in this

figure 2.6: the leading contribution for   0 of auxiliary vertices in which the pairs of
momenta in the four-point functions are exceptional.

way we have s internal propagators with momentum q2 = 2 producing the factor 2s

in (2.44). loop corrections to the internal propagators results in non-leading logarithmic

powers.

in the same way we construct the auxiliary vertices for an odd number of soft mo-

menta. the leading contribution is the same as in g. 6 since the presence of the last

soft momentum is unimportant. we have then

(2.45)

as noticed above, all the contributions with higher vertices, with loop corrections in the

propagators or with the derivatives acting on vertices lead to lower powers of t.

(iii) iteration at loop  + 1

we now deduce the behaviour of the vertices at loop  + 1 for   0 by inserting the
results for the auxiliary vertices at loop  in the integral equations.

(a) for the two-point function we nd

(+1)
1

(+1)
2

() = o(2t )  0 ,
() = o(2t )  0 ,

and, for a non-soft momentum p

(+1)

2

(p; ) = o(0) .

this follows from eqs. (2.38) and (2.39).

(b) for the four-point function at non-exceptional momenta eq. (2.43) gives

(+1)
3

() = o(2t )  0 ,

(+1)

4

(p1,   , p4; ) = o(0) .

(2.47)

again loop corrections in s() do not contribute to the leading terms.

(c) finally, for (+1)

2n,0 with n > 2 we infer from (2.43)

(+1)
2n,0 (p1,   , p2n; ) = o(0) .

(2.48)

thus we conclude from (2.47)-(2.48) that all the physical vertices at  = 0 and with

non-exceptional momenta are nite. this veries at loop  + 1 the main assumption

(2.37).

we then go on to test the additional assumptions.

32

the massless scalar case

2,1

(d) to study the behaviour of (+1)
for p2 = o(2) we need the subtracted integral
()
4,3(q, p,p,q; ) with q2 = 2, p2  2 and  > . we appreciate that the last term
in the denition (2.17) of 4 can be estimated from (2.38) and, since the -integration
is nite, its contribution is proportional to p2  2, without logarithmic powers. for the
remaining terms, we use the taylor expansion

()
4,3(q, p,p,q; )  ()

4,3(q, 0, 0,q; ) =z 1

0

dx(p  )()

4,1 (q, p,p,q; )|2=q2, p=xp .

inserting this expansion and the result (2.46) in the integral equation (2.16), we get

(+1)

2

(p; )  o(p2 t ) .

(2.49)

this proves (2.41) at loop  + 1.

(e) for the vertices with pairs of exceptional momenta it is straightforward to prove

(2.38)-(2.39) at loop  + 1 by using the result (2.44).

(f) for the vertices with all exceptional momenta we show (2.42) holds at +1-loop order.

for n = 1 this is simply obtained by taking the derivative of eq. (2.49) with respect to

p. for n > 1 this can be done by writing

and using (2.46).

summing up, in this chapter we have exploited the scalar theory as a toy model

to introduce the exact rg formulation and to show how in our language perturbative

renormalizability and infrared niteness follow from dimensional counting. in the next

chapter we will devote to the implementation of symmetries in this framework.

chapter 3

the quantum action principle

implementation of symmetries in the rg formulation is the main subject of this thesis.

we will realize throughout this section such a goal is not really straightforward. as a

matter of fact, in trying to apply the rg method to a theory with local symmetry, we

encounter the problem that the division of momenta into large or small (according to the

scale ) is incompatible with gauge invariance. this is easy to appreciate if we consider

the homogeneous gauge transformation

(x) 7 (x)(x) .

since in momentum space (p) is mapped into a convolution with the gauge transforma-

tion , any division of momenta into high and low is seen not to be preserved by gauge

transformations. in order to solve this problem, either we break the gauge invariance

in intermediate steps, aiming to recover it at the physical point  = 0 by imposition of

some constraints or the rg is generalized in such a way the symmetry is manifestly pre-

served. clearly, manifest preservation of gauge invariance would be preferable. although

an attempt in this direction has recently been done in ref. [25], we will not discuss this

option further here, but instead give a detailed study of the former.

we will follow ref. [26] and show an analogue of the quantum action principle (qap)

exists for the solution of the broken ward identities. when these are solved, the unbroken

ward identities are guaranteed to hold once the cuto is removed. indeed in this way,

renormalized physical green functions, with the correct gauge dependence, evaluated at

non-zero subtraction points (when necessary, i.e. when massless particles are present),

may be constructed order by order in the couplings.

in ref. [27, 28] the background eld method was used in the rg formulation. this

allows to maintain background gauge invariance by replacing the division of momenta into

34

the quantum action principle

high or low by a division of eigenvalues of the background covariant laplacian. however,

we should note that background eld invariance does not suce to ensure the quantum

gauge invariance i.e. brs invariance in gauge xed systems. for example, it is the

latter that ensures that longitudinal modes are properly cancelled by ghosts in internal

propagators, i.e. that unitarity is maintained, not the former.

we will now address the problem of the broken slavnov-taylor (st) identities and

discuss the so-called quantum action principle.

3.1 the quantum action principle

the quantum action principle describes the response of a quantum eld theory under a

eld transformation. thus it is a quite powerful tool in the construction of eld theories

with symmetry properties. even if it was rstly established in the bphz renormaliza-

tion scheme [29], its validity was conrmed independently of the renormalization scheme
[30, 31]. let us denote by a an innitesimal variation of the eld a, by l the corre-
sponding innitesimal variation of the lagrangian. at the classical level we can write the

trivial identity

z d4y

rx l(x)

a(y)

a(y) =z d4x l(x) .

(3.1)

if we supply the classical lagrangian l(x) with an additional term coupling the external
source a(x) to the eld variation, eq. (3.1) reads

z d4y

rx l(x)

a(y)

rx l(x)

a(y)

=z d4x l(x) .

(3.2)

the qap states this identity generalizes to all order in perturbation theory under the
form 1

z d4x

[, ]
a(x)

[, ]
a(x)

= [] ,

(3.3)

where the insertion  is local and a normal product of degree d

d = 4  dimension (a) + degree (a) .

identity (3.3) can be written for z[j, ]

z[j, ] =z d exp i{sbrs[, ] + scounterterms[] + jaa} ,

1the presence of a regulator of uv divergences is assumed.

3.2 eective slavnov-taylor identities

35

under the form

z d4x ja(x)

z[j, ]
a(x)

=z d [, ] exp i{sbrs[, ] + scounterterms[] + jaa} .

(3.4)

then the response of the system is given by the insertion of a local operator of dimension

d as above. when removing the regulator (uv limit)  is nite, at least in perturbation

theory, and this ensures that also the insertion of the operator  is nite in the uv limit.

in general one is interested in solving the equation  = 0. on the other hand, since in
perturbation theory [] =  +o(), the insertion of  is also local at the rst order in
which  itself is non-vanishing. due to the existence of a nite number of local operators

of the correct dimension, the equation  = 0 gives rise, order by order, to a nite number

of conditions, which can eventually be satised by ne-tuning [32] the parameters in the

action sbrs + scounterterms.

the qap consists of the relations (3.3) and (3.4), together with locality of , and must

be understood as a general theorem of renormalization theory to be used in any formalism

[33]. however, it is not obvious how the qap can be obtained for an eective theory. in

fact, the procedure of integrating the high energy degrees of freedom generates eective

non-local interactions i.e. a series of local interactions of arbitrarily high numbers

of derivatives and also the eld transformations become non-local. we will see that

qap is an extremely powerful theorem and suces to discuss st identities or their

generalizations describing gauge invariance.

3.2 eective slavnov-taylor identities

the gauge symmetry requires that the generating functional z[j, ] satises the st

identity [32, 34]

where sj is the usual st operator

sj z[j, ] = 0 ,

(3.5)

sj =zp

ja(p) ()a



a(p)

.

the st identity can be directly formulated for the wilson eective action se at any .
consider the generalized brs transformation

a(p) = k0(p) 

se
a(p)

,

(3.6)

36

the quantum action principle

in which  is a grassmann parameter. performing such a change of variable in the

functional integral (1.4), we deduce the following identity

sj z[j, ] = n[j, ; ]z d exp i(cid:8) 1

2(, d1)0 + (j, )0 + se[; ](cid:9) e[, ; ] .

(3.7)

the operator giving the st identities violation at the eective level is

e[, ; ] = izp

a(p)



a(p)(cid:27) exp (ise)

+izp

a(p) d1

ab (p)

se
b(p)

.

whereas the l.h.s of the identity (3.7) arises from the variation of the source term (j, )0,
the functional e originates from the jacobian of the transformation (3.6) and from the
variation of the rest of the exponent in (1.4). restoration of symmetry, sj z[j, ] = 0,
translates into

e[, ; ] = 0

for any  .

in order to get information about e, in the following we will study in detail the prop-
erties of the ow of this operator. e satises a linear evolution equation (found by
explicit derivation) [4, 17, 18, 26]

e =zp

[k0(p)]{l1 + l2}e ,

(3.8)

where the linear operators l1 and l2 are given by

l1 = ()adab(p)

l2 =

i
2

dab(p)

.

(3.9)

se
a(p)

b(p)

a(p) b(p)

in eq. (3.8) we restored the powers of  in order to show how in the r.h.s. of the ow
equation for e there are terms at the same loop order of the l.h.s..

since e satises a linear equation, the gauge symmetry condition e = 0 is veried
for any  if we can set to zero the boundary conditions of (3.8). the main point is to x
to zero the ones for the relevant part e,rel of e for some value r of the ir cuto.
normally e,rel(r) = 0 is a set of constraints which overdeterminates the couplings
in se(r). if the boundary conditions are set at r 6= 0, the number of independent
constraints can be reduced by exploiting the so-called consistency conditions, which are a

set of algebraic identities coming from the anticommutativity of the dierential operator

3.2 eective slavnov-taylor identities

37



 [4]. we can extract e,rel(r) by expanding the vertices of e(r) around

vanishing momenta, even though we are considering massless particles. the result is
that the consistency conditions constrain some couplings in e,rel(r), so that the set
e,rel(r) = 0 can be fullled in some cases by tuning the parameters in se,rel. such
an analysis was performed in ref. [4] for the pure gauge su(2) model.

on the other hand, if the boundary conditions are set at the physical point r = 0, the
consistency conditions follow from the nihilpotency of the st operator. in a theory with

one or more massless particles, we have to introduce non-vanishing subtraction points
in order to dene e,rel(r = 0). this fact could spoil the power of the consistency
conditions since they now involve also irrelevant vertices of e(0) evaluated at the
subtraction points [17, 18]. thus it seems that a case-by-case analysis based on a ltration
of e is required in order to prove the locality of e so as to restore the usefulness of the
consistency conditions. however, these nasty irrelevant contributions are of the reducible

type (see the form of l1 in (3.9)), and we expect they will disappear when taking the
legendre transform, similarly to what happened in passing from the wilsonian eective

action to the cuto eective action. again, from a perturbative point of view, instead
of studying e it is convenient to introduce [35, 26, 9] its legendre transform , in
which reducible contributions are absent. recalling (1.9) which relates se[, ; ] to
w [j, ; ], and using (1.12) we nd

notice that at  = 0 the cuto st identity reduces to (0) = 0 and, in the uv limit,
becomes the usual st identity (3.5). moreover we have inserted the factor  in (3.13) to
put into evidence that  vanishes at the tree level.

the expression of  is simpler in terms of , dened in (1.18). this functional diers
from the cuto eective action only in the tree-level two-point function, in which the ir
cuto has been removed. with such a denition, in the 0   limit the tree-level
contribution to () coincides with sbrs, whereas at the tree level 2() contains the
ir cuto (see (2.8)). in terms of  the functional  can be rewritten as

at any . the existence of such a limit is guaranteed in perturbation theory by the

uv niteness of the cuto eective action (perturbative renormalizability). in order to
show this property holds also for , it suces to recognize that the presence of cuto
functions having almost non-intersecting supports forces the loop momenta in (3.13) to
be of the order of . henceforth we will take the 0   limit in .

3.3 perturbative solution of  = 0

the proof of the st identity (3.11) in the rg formalism, with possible anomalies, is

based on induction in the loop number and is discussed in [16, 17, 18, 26, 35, 36]. once

again the ow equation for the cuto st identity is found by explicit derivation [26]. its

but it is easy to grasp its meaning, that is the evolution of the vertices of  at the loop
 depends on vertices of  itself at lower loop order.

therefore, if ()

 = 0 at any loop order  < , then

()

 = 0 .

(3.19)

we can thus analyse  at an arbitrary value of . there are two natural choices
corresponding to  = 0 and  = r much bigger than the subtraction scale , i.e. r =
0. with the former the gauge symmetry condition xes the relevant part of the eective
action in terms of the physical coupling g() and provides the boundary conditions of

the rg ow, whereas with the latter the gauge symmetry condition determines the

cuto dependent bare couplings. with this choice the implementation of symmetry is
simplied due to the locality 2 of the functionals involved. although the computation of

physical vertices is generally cumbersome, this second possibility is more convenient in

the computation of quantities which do not evolve with the cuto . to show how things

work, in the following chapters we will compute starting from  the beta function
for the massless scalar theory and the gauge anomaly.

we now discuss the vanishing of . also for this functional we dene its relevant part,
isolating all monomials in the elds, sources and their derivatives with dimension three.
the rest is included in ,irr. at the uv scale 0 the functional (0) is schematically
represented in g. 1. at this scale  is local, or, more precisely, ,irr(0) = o( 1
), so
that the irrelevant contributions disappear in the 0   limit. this can be understood
with the following argument. from (3.17), (0) is manifestly relevant, since (0) =
rel(0), while it is easy to convince oneself that (0) = ,rel(0) + o( 1
). as a
matter of fact, from (3.13) we notice that irrelevant terms may arise from [, ; 0]
and the cuto functions. at 0,  is given by either a relevant vertex or a sequence of
relevant vertices joint by propagators with a cuto function k0(q + p ), where p is
a combination of external momenta (see (1.15)). since the integral is damped by these

0

0

cuto functions, only the contributions with a restricted number of propagators survive
in the 0   limit. we can infer from power counting that they are of the relevant
type. a similar argument holds for the possible irrelevant contributions coming from

k00(p). then (3.19) ensures the locality of () at any .

2here and in the following a functional is said to be local when it contains only couplings with

non-negative dimension.

3.3.1 solution of  = 0 at  = 0

once the locality of () is shown, the solvability of the equation () = 0 can
be proven using cohomological methods [32, 34, 40]. this is a consequence of the -

independence of  and the solvability of the same equation at  = 0, where the co-
homological problem reduces to the standard one. henceforth we will consider the rst

loop, the generalization to higher loops being straightforward due to the iterative nature

of the solution. using (3.17), at  = 0 and at the rst loop (3.11) reads

s(0) (1)(0) + (1)

,rel(0) = 0 .

(3.20)

this ne-tuning equation allows to x some of the relevant couplings in (1)(0). as a
matter of fact the most general functional (1)(0) can be cast into the form (1.17) and
split into two contributions

(1)(0) = (1)

inv(0) + (1)(0) ,

(3.21)

where inv contains all the independent monomials which are invariant, i.e. s(0) (1)
0. the remaining monomials contribute to . inserting (3.21) into (3.20), we nd

inv =

s(0) (1)(0) =  (1)

 (0) ,

which yields the couplings in (1) since (1)
 (0) depends only on sbrs. an explicit
calculation shows that the only divergences are powers of 0 according to the dimension
of the relative vertex. in particular dimensionless couplings are nite, due to the presence

in (3.13) of cuto functions having almost non-intersecting supports. in chapter 5 we

will perform an explicit computation of some of these couplings in qcd.

the breaking of dilatation

invariance: the callan-symanzik

equation

let us go back to the massless 4 theory, dened at the classical level by the classical

action

the classical theory is invariant under a dilatation transformation, which, in the innites-

imal version, reads

(x) =  (1 + x) (x) .

(4.2)

notice that this invariance is lost in presence of a mass term; in that case the dilatation

invariance is said to be softly broken. the symmetry expressed in (4.2) is of the global

type, the innitesimal parameter  being constant. thus this invariance can be translated

into a classical ward identity

(4.3)

let us consider the quantum extension of eq. (4.2). we know the eective action []

has to full the normalization conditions (2.1). using the quantum action principle eq.

(3.3) for dilatation invariance wd (4.3) we get

wd = [] ,

(4.4)

where  is an even integrated insertion of dimension 4. a basis for [] may be provided

by the quantum extension of the terms appearing in the classical action (4.1) plus a mass

(4.5)

the expansion of [] in this basis yields the anomalous dilatation ward identity

wd = (n  g) +  m

(4.6)

where , ,  are formal power series in  starting from the order . the term n

in the r.h.s. may be absorbed in the l.h.s. by renormalizing the dilatation dimension

of (x). as a consequence the innitesimal transformation (4.2) in eq. (4.4) has to be

replaced by

(x) =  (1   + x) (x) ,

(4.7)

calling  the anomalous dimension of the eld . however, even by renormalizing the

dimension of the eld, asymptotic invariance, i.e. invariance possibly broken by a soft

mass term, can not be maintained at the quantum level, since the second term in the

r.h.s. of eq. (4.6) is still present.

the anomalous ward identity (4.6) can be rewritten in the form of a parametric

equation with the help of the following identity arising from dimensional analysis

( + wd) = 0 ,

(4.8)

with  the normalization point introduced in (2.1) 1. combining eqs. (4.6) and (4.8) we

derive the callan-symanzik equation [37]

( + g  n) =  m ,

(4.9)

which controls the asymptotic behaviour of the theory at large euclidean momenta, when

the soft mass insertion m becomes negligible. moreover, dimensional analysis enables
us to identify  with the gell-mann low beta function for the coupling g [38]

and the anomalous dimension  with

4.1 dilatation invariance in the rg

45

4.1 dilatation invariance in the rg

how symmetries can be implemented in the wilson rg has been extensively discussed

in the previous chapter. we treated there the general case of gauge invariance, that is

invariance of the classical action under a local transformation of the elds. anyway, it

is straightforward to adapt the derivation of the functional  introduced in sect. 3.2 to
dilatation transformations. as we are in presence of a global symmetry, the st identity

can be replaced by a ward identity and we may think to the brs source as a global,

anticommuting parameter.

we now want to formulate an eective dilatation ward identity for the cuto eective

action () (or its relative ). let us start from the anomalous ward identity (4.6). we

expect the presence of the scale  in the cuto eective action will make such a relation

unreliable.

in fact what happens is that by requiring the physical eective action to

be independent of the normalization point  we force the functional () to obey a
modied, eective identity, and this at any scale  2. since at the physical point  = 0

the functional  coincides with the physical eective action, we demand our modied

identity to reproduce eq. (4.9). we know from chapter 3 that in the rg formulation the

breaking of a symmetry which in our case is the invariance of  under the operator

 + wd is expressed by the functional  introduced in sect. 3.2. with the help of
eq. (3.11), the functional  can be written as

(  + wd) () + () = () .

on the other hand the functional wd () can be expanded in the basis (4.5)

wd() = (() g + () n) () + m()

(4.12)

(4.13)

where () and () are suitable coecients. taking into account that ( = 0) = 
and ( = 0) = 0 (see (3.13)), at the physical point the functions () and () equal
the corresponding physical ones

( = 0) =  ,

( = 0) = 

(4.14)

and the qap tells us they are determined by physical vertices.

at the uv scale, instead, (0) is relevant and has the form (2.3), with the cou-
given by the relevant couplings i() evaluated at  = 0. at this scale the

plings (b)

4(x)(cid:27) =  (0) .

(4.15)

we can extrapolate the values of the -beta function () and of the -anomalous

dimension () at the uv scale. eq. (4.15) yields

( = 0) = 0 ,

( = 0) = 0 .

thus in this limit it is only the mass insertion m(0) which contributes to (0).

being allowed to peruse the structure of the functional  at an arbitrary scale, we
decide to set  = 0 and then take the 0   limit. when eq. (4.15) is projected onto
the basis of the monomials appearing in the classical action (4.1) and in the bare action

(2.3), it supplies the set of equations

(4.18)

where 1, 2, 3 are the coecient of the monomials 1

(0). eqs. (4.16)-(4.18) can be thought of as the modied ward identities for the
cuto eective action.

it would be desirable to compute the physical beta function for the coupling g and

anomalous dimension for the eld  in the rg formulation. although the set of equations

(4.16)-(4.18) enables us to get closer to the objects we are searching, we still lack a piece

of information, that is we need to know how the functions  and  are related to the bare

couplings i(0). at this stage the rg ow enters into the game.

it is acknowledged renormalization pertains to the uv property of the theory. thus

we expect that -rg, governed by eq. (4.9) which expresses the requirement that physical

observables are independent of the specic value of , is connected to -rg, governed

by (1.16), when  is in the uv region [39]. to nd out such a connection, we rewrite eq.

(2.3) as

[; 0] = 1

where the uv elds and couplings are so dened

47

the beta function (g) can now be inferred either from the second or the third of eqs.
(4.20) by demanding the uv couplings uv

3 and z are functions of g() and /0, we get

(g) =

0 0 guv
g guv =

0 0 3  2 3 0 0 log z

g 3  2 3 g log z

.

(4.21)

since the loop expansion for z starts at the second order in , at the rst loop (4.21)

gives

(1) = 0

(1)

.

(4.22)

thus dimensional analysis and the ward identity (4.18) provide us with a recipe to

compute the one loop beta function, since

(1)(g) =  (1)

3 (0) .

(4.23)

a thorough perusal of the procedure which has driven us so far should make us realize that

in this perspective the beta function appears as the anomaly of the classical dilatation

invariance, the so-called trace anomaly. however, such an anomaly proves to be harmless,
since the counterterms introduced by  are the same monomials the classical action (4.1)
is made of.

in addition to the calculation of the beta function rst order coecient from (4.18),

we will directly verify eq. (4.16) leads to a vanishing one-loop anomalous dimension and
determine the coecient (1)
2 (0) through (4.17). this will be the topic of the following
section.

4.2 the one-loop beta function

the one-loop coecient of the beta function is given, according to (4.23), by an explicit
calculation of the dilatation breaking term (1)
3 (0), which can be built from eq. (3.13).
since we are dealing with a ward identity, the term 2 
(q) (p) in (3.13) has to be read as
the functional derivative of the variation (4.2) with respect to  in the momentum space,
which is simply the eld independent term (3  p /p)  (p  q). at the rst order
this is multiplied by the tree-level vertices of . the term proportional to bc in (3.13)
gives rise to a contribution which, being eld independent, will be neglected. moreover,
the product of the full propagator 2(p; ) by d0 is li at this order. to extract
the 4 component of , in eq. (3.13) we have to insert the second term in the iterative

48

expansion of the functional (0) in vertices of (0) (see g. 2.3). finally, the 4 component
of (1)

that the anomalous dimension  vanishes at this order. the integral (4.31) produces a

chapter 5

su (n ) yang-mills theory

as widely discussed in chapter 3, the challenging problem with gauge theories is that

local gauge symmetry typically conicts with the presence of a momentum cuto. what

we have to show is that the slavnov-taylor identities can be implemented perturbatively

by appropriately xing the boundary conditions on the rg ow. thus the key issue
is to constrain the nite number of relevant parameters in rel[, ; ]. actually it is
at this stage we implement both the physical parameters (such as masses, couplings,

wave-function normalizations) and the symmetry, i.e. st identities.

in ref. [4] the exact rg is formulated for the su(2) yang-mills theory and the bound-
ary conditions for the relevant parameters in se,rel[, ; ] are imposed at a non-physical
point  =  6= 0, so that the relevant parameters can be dened by expanding the ver-
tices around vanishing momenta. although with this choice the relevant parameters are

not directly related to the physical couplings in the eective action [, ], the analysis

of relevant parts of the st identities becomes easy.

on the other hand, in ref. [16, 17] the boundary conditions for the same theory are

given at the physical point  = 0. in this case the procedure of extracting the relevant

parameters becomes rather involved, since non-vanishing subtraction points appear when

massless particles are present. the ne-tuning equation is explicitly solved, that is the

relevant parameters which are not xed by the physical couplings and wave-function

normalizations are expressed in terms of physical vertices.

we propose here an alternative procedure, based on the solution of the ne-tuning

equation at the ultraviolet scale. this will be the topic of the chapter.

and wa
only through the combination wa

 + g ca (no source is introduced for ca). in fact sbrs depends on ua

 and ca
. we expect this property will hold also for the cuto

eective action.

we now come to the denition of the cuto eective action. we have already appre-

ciated that in order to quantize the theory we need a regularization procedure of the uv

divergences. we regularize these divergences by assuming that in the path integral only

the elds with frequencies smaller than a given uv cuto 0 are integrated out. this
procedure is equivalent to assume the free propagators vanish for p2 > 2
0. then the
physical theory is recovered in the limit 0   . the generating functional is dened
in eq. (1.2)

z[j, ] = eiw [j,] =z d exp i{ 1

(5.6)

the introduction of the cuto function in the propagators breaks the gauge invariance,

therefore the uv action sint must contain all possible renormalizable interactions which
are needed to compensate the symmetry breaking induced by the regularization. these

are given by the monomials in the elds, brs sources and their derivatives which have

dimension not larger than four and are lorentz and su(n) scalars, since lorentz and

global gauge symmetries are preserved by the cuto regularization. the independent

monomials of the yang-mills sector are

tr (a a) ,

tr (a a) ,

tr (a a) ,

tr (w c) ,

tr (a a a) ,

tr (a a a) ,

tr (w c a) , tr (v c c) ,

tr (a a) tr (a a) ,

tr (a a) tr (a a) ,

(5.7)

  a, v = va  a and the trace is over the adjoint

representation. notice that in the su(2) case there are only one monomial with three

  a, c = ca  a, w = wa

gauge elds and two independent monomials with four gauge elds, while for su(3) only

three monomials with four gauge elds are independent. all these interactions appear

in sint with couplings of non-negative dimension (relevant parameters) which depend
on 0.
in order to obtain the physical theory we have to show not only that these
relevant parameters can be xed in such a way that the 0   limit can be taken by
xing the physical parameters such as the masses, the coupling g and the wave function
normalization constant at a subtraction point , but also that in the 0   limit the
slavnov-taylor identities are satised. perturbative renormalizability ensures the rst

requirement can be fullled [2, 4, 15, 16].

according to wilson, we then integrate the elds with frequencies 2 < p2 < 2

0 and
dene the wilsonian eective action se[, ; ]. the requirement that the generating
functional (1.2) is independent of  gives rise to a ow equation (1.10), (1.16) for se
or for its legendre transform [, ; ], respectively. all this procedure was studied in

detail in sect. 1.1, 1.2.

t (p; ) = a() + t (p; ) , t (p; )|p2=2 = 0 ,

(5.10)

(5.11)

from these conditions we can factorize a dimensional function of p in the vertices l,t .
thus they are irrelevant and contribute to irr().
2) the contribution to () due to three vectors can be written as

 (p, q, r; ) = [(p  q)g + (q  r)g + (r  p)g] [3a + (3a)(p, q, r)]

+ (3a)

 (p, q, r) .

in the last term all the three lorentz indices are carried by external momenta. hence,
after these have been factorized, the remnant is a function of dimension 2. then the
vertex (3a)

 (p, q, r; ) is irrelevant. also (3a)(p, q, r; ) is irrelevant, being dened by

in the vertex (4a)abcd
thus it is irrelevant. the two relevant couplings 4a() and 



at least two lorentz indices are carried by external momenta and

4a() are dened by

(4a)

(p, q, r, h)|4sp = 0 ,

(p, q, r, h)|4sp = 0 .

4) the w-c vertex reads

(wc)



(p) =

[i + wc + (wc)(p)] ,

(5.14)

with a relevant coupling dened through

(wc)(p)|p2=2 = 0 .

as to the ghost propagator, it can be expressed in terms of the vertex (wc)



(p)

(cc)(p) = p2 + ip2[wc + (wc)(p)] .

(5.15)

5) the contribution of w-c-a to () is given by the su(2) scalar

(p, q, r) = g[wca + (wca)(p, q, r)] + (wca)

(p, q, r; ) is irrelevant since the two lorentz indices are carried by



(wca)(p, q, r; )|3sp = 0 .

56

su (n ) yang-mills theory

due to the fact that  depends on c and u only through the combination w, the
coecient of c-c-a is

(cca)



(p, q, r) = ig p (wca)



(p, q, r) .

(5.17)

6) finally, the only vertex involving the source v and containing a relevant coupling is

(vcc)(p, q, r) = vcc + (vcc)(p, q, r) , (vcc)(p, q, r; )|3sp = 0 .

(5.18)

at the tree level (0) = sbrs, so that the relevant couplings in the tree approximation
have the following values

 () = (0)

m () = (0)
(0)
3a () = ig , (0)

vcc() = 1 .

(5.19)

a () = (0)

wc () = 

(0)
4a () = 0 ,

4a () = g2 , (0)

wca() = (0)

all the remaining vertices, being coecients of monomials with dimension higher than

four, are irrelevant and therefore belong to irr().

5.1.2 boundary conditions

as discussed in chapter 1, for the irrelevant vertices we assume the following boundary

condition

irr[, ; 0] = 0 ,

(5.20)

since, due to dimensional reasons, they must vanish at the uv scale to ensure pertur-

bative renormalizability. then at  = 0 the cuto eective action becomes local and
corresponds to the bare action.

as regards the relevant part, we rst have to address the fundamental issue of sym-

metry. that will be done in the next section.

5.2 eective st identities

the gauge symmetry of the classical action (5.1) translates into the st identity for the
eective action [, ]  [, ;  = 0], which reads
s[, ] = 0 ,

where [, ] = [, ] r d4x 1

in (3.16).

2(aa

)2 and the slavnov operator [34] s was dened

5.3 solution of the ne-tuning at  = 0

57

in the context of rg, the st identities are recovered by imposing the constraint

(3.11), which is exploited to set the boundary conditions for the couplings in the cuto

eective action (or ). for the gauge theory we are considering, eqs. (3.14) and (3.13)

specialize into

where  is the expression obtained by removing the gauge xing term in (1.18). we

should observe that eq. (5.22) diers from its analogue (3.13) in a twofold way. first, in

the former the index i does not run on the antighost c due to the fact we did not introduce

a brs source for it, contrary to summation over j which includes c (it propagates in the

loop). second, the price we have to pay to eliminate the brs source for c is the removal
of the tree level of (wc)

in the argument of 2/  in (5.22).



again we notice that at  = 0 and in the uv limit the gauge symmetry condition

(3.11) reduces to the usual st identities, since  becomes  and  vanishes.

at this stage we are ready to discuss the solution of the eective st identity at the

ultraviolet scale.

5.3 solution of the ne-tuning at  = 0

we have described in the previous section how the st identities can been directly for-

mulated for the cuto eective action (or ) at any . in this context the st identities

are recovered by imposing the condition (3.11), which, at the rst loop and at  = 0
becomes eq. (3.20). in the following we discuss the solution of this ne-tuning equation
at  = 0 and at the rst loop order. under these conditions, the functional (1)
 is the
standard slavnov operator applied to 

(1)
 (0) = s(0) (1)(0) .

let us analyse in detail the various vertices of , which can be inferred from eq. (3.16).

(5.23)

that (3.15) holds at the tree level trivially follows from the transversality of (aa)

get is

this is no surprise, since we expected the breaking of gauge invariance. on the other
hand, we can match the values of the couplings (1)

coecients of the corresponding monomials in . this is the meaning of the ne-tuning.
we just have to prove the numbers coming out from  are nite. this topic will be
addressed in the following section.

only if the following relation among the divergent part of the coupling constants at loop

there exists a consistency condition relating (wacc)abcd

and (3ac)abcd

. the former

to (5.28).

(iv) finally, the last vertex of  we have to consider is

 (p + h, q, k; 0)

 (q + h, p, k; 0)

 (k + h, q, p; 0) .

using (5.8) and the denitions of the vertices of , we have

(3ac)abcd

,

(p, q, k, h; 0) = h g(cid:2)b1(cid:0)abcd + acbd(cid:1) + b2 adbc(cid:3)
+ h g(cid:2)b1(cid:0)abcd + adbc(cid:1) + b2 accd(cid:3)

(5.33)

recalling (5.19), it is easy to verify b1 = b2 = 0 at the tree level, whereas at the rst
loop order eq. (5.33) provides two independent relations among the couplings



4a = 0 ,

i

4a  g 

wc = 

3a  ig 

wca .

(5.34)

hence from (5.34) we learn 

4a is nite at this order and we earn a further constraint to
add to eqs. (5.27), (5.30). in the whole the relevant part of the cuto eective action

for the su(2) gauge theory contains nine couplings. the divergent contributions of six
of those, namely 
4a, are related by three equations, which

vcc and 

wca, 

3a, 

wc, 

a, 

60

su (n ) yang-mills theory

express the brs invariance of the divergent part of (0), whereas the counterterms
necessary to restore gauge symmetry are nite and non-invariant. it follows only three
of the divergent couplings are independent, let us say 
wca, and we ascribe
them the role of wave function renormalization for the vector eld, z1, for the ghost eld,
z2 and of the coupling z3 g. hence the functional (0) can be split into two contributions

wc, and 

a, 

(1)(0) = (1)

inv(0) + (1)(0) ,

(5.35)

where inv contains all the independent monomials which are invariant, i.e. s(0) (1)

the remaining monomials contribute to  which contains the nite couplings i = i

evaluated at  = 0. in the following section we will determine the couplings i() via
ne-tuning. as to the couplings in (5.36), they are not involved in the ne-tuning, so

that they are free and can be xed at the physical point  = 0.

5.3.1 solution of the ne-tuning at the rst loop

we stated in the previous section we would demonstrate the niteness of the functional
 at the rst loop. in fact we will do more than that, in the sense we will also explicitly
compute some of the nite parts of the relevant couplings, i.e. i, through the ne-tuning
eq. (3.20). let us now build up the vertices of (1)
 . we start from (5.22), which at the
rst loop and in the 0   limit has the form

(5.37)

to get such an expression we should notice that in (5.22) the term proportional to jl
does not contribute since in [, ; 0] diagonal interactions between a eld and its own
source are absent. moreover the product of the full propagator 2(p; ) by d0 in

5.3 solution of the ne-tuning at  = 0

(5.22) is simply li at this order. as the second derivative of the functional (0) in (5.37)
is concerned, we have just two possibilities, that is either

2(cid:16)(0)  1

j (q) wa

when discussing the topic of symmetry, we stated this integration produces a nite result,

to be compared with (5.24), so that the requirement of gauge invariance forces us to x

some of the relevant couplings. we can perform the q-integration in (5.43) with dierent

choices of the cuto function. in any case we have to expand the integrand in powers of
p2/2

on the contrary, if a smooth cuto is used both 1 and 2 can be determined. we are
obviously led to pick up a cuto which is advantageous from the computational point of

view. the possibility of performing feynman parametrization, for example, is denitely

appealing. with this in mind, we can employ the following cuto functions

k00(q) =

(q2 + 2

k0(q) = q2 q2 + 22

another manageable cuto is the exponential function

k00(q) = eq2/2

k0(q) = 1  eq2/2

in this case feynman parametrization is replaced by the representation

5.3.2 vertices of  with more than two elds

if we want to analyse the vertices of (1)
 with more than two elds we have rst to go
back to eq. (5.41) and then through the cuto function k00 glue the vertices (5.39),
(5.40) with higher terms in the iterative expansion of (0) in vertices of (0). we start
from the second order of the expansion of (0); a graphical representation is given in
g. 3.

figure 5.3: graphical representation of the contribution to  obtained in its expansion to the
second order in vertices of .

when we build all possible combinations of vertices of  and  we obtain the contribution
to (1)
 with three elds, that is (aac)
, , except one term which originates from
the irreducible four-vector vertex of .

, and (wcc)

fig. 4 and g. 5 represent the contributions to (aac)
, , respectively. obviously
some of the graphs could also be excluded by lorentz covariance and gauge invariance.

, and (wcc)

this is the case for example for the term mentioned above and corresponding to the

graph of g. 4(e). in order to clarify how things work, we compute up to a constant
factor one of the contribution to (wcc)

we deduce

when adding the contribution which arises from the graph of g. 5(b) what we obtain

is a symmetric in a proper sense result, i.e. a term proportional to p. as we did for
m and , this result, together with all other contributions coming from the graphs of
g. 5, can be used to x the combination vcc  wca in (5.29), via eq. (3.20).

we can now carry on with the perusal of the functional (1)

 . experience suggests
us our attention must be devoted to two kinds of vertices, i.e. ((na)c,1)
and (w(na)cc,1)
,
with n the number of vector elds. qualitatively, the behaviour of the leading term of





the two vertices can be inferred from power counting.

the former can be either of the type represented in g. 6 or of the type of g. 4(a)

with the insertion of n three-vector vertices. in any case, the cuto function k00 
let us consider (5.45) just to x ideas brings a factor 4
0/k4, k being the integration
momentum; there are n propagators producing a factor (1/k2)n, n three-vector vertices
(or n  1 three-vector vertices and a c-c-a vertex) contributing at most with kn and
nally the integration measure goes like k4. the presence of the factor 4
0 implies only
with integrands behaving at least like (1/k4) we will end up with nite, relevant vertices
of . hence, taking into account the powers of momentum, the possible value of n is
restricted by

4  2n + n + 4  4

=

n  4 .

in fact n = 4 is excluded by lorentz and gauge covariance.

0/k4 brought
by k00; factors (1/k2)(n+2) and k(n+1) are due to the propagators and to the vertices,
respectively and the integration measure goes like k4. therefore, in the 0   limit a
non-vanishing result will be obtained only if

5.4 comparison with the ne-tuning at  = 0

so far our direction has been to discuss the symmetry at the ultraviolet scale and deter-

mine the cuto-dependent i(0). an alternative point of view is to set the boundary
conditions for these couplings at the physical point  = 0 [16, 17]. in this way some of

the relevant couplings (i.e. the zis) are related to physical couplings such as the wave
function normalizations and the three-vector coupling g at a subtraction point . the

remaining are xed imposing the symmetry at the physical point.

in order to show the equivalence of the two formulations, we have to compute the
couplings (1)
i (0) starting from their boundary conditions at  = 0 [16] and letting
them evolve via eq. (1.16) to the uv scale. even though this will be done only for the

couplings m(0) and (0), the argument can be generalized to all the couplings i.
the ne-tuning at  = 0 provides for the two couplings we are examining the boundary

68

su (n ) yang-mills theory

conditions, which, due to gluon transversality, are simply

m(0) = (0) = 0 .

from eq. (1.16) we can now derive the loop expansion [16] and, at the rst loop we have

chiral gauge theories and anomalies

the problem of nding a consistent renormalization procedure of a chiral gauge theory

(cgt) is still an active eld of investigation, both in the framework of perturbation the-

ory [41]-[45] and in lattice regularization [46, 47]. in the presence of chiral fermions no

regularization is known to preserve chiral symmetry. this is not a technical problem but

it is related to the fact that chiral symmetry is anomalous [48]. in dimensional regulariza-

tion with minimal subtraction [41]-[44] the correct denition of the matrix 5 produces
chiral breaking terms [49], although they formally vanish for d  4. the appearance
of these breaking terms is necessary to reproduce the anomaly for external currents. in

order to ensure the slavnov-taylor identities of the local chiral symmetry for the renor-

malized theory, the minimal subtraction procedure must be supplemented by additional

nite non-invariant counterterms [41]-[50]. similarly, in lattice regularization one must

introduce the wilson term in order to avoid the fermion doubling and reproduce the

correct anomaly. this term explicitly breaks chiral invariance and one adds all possible

counterterms to the naive action to compensate the explicit symmetry breaking induced

by the wilson term [46]. we should notice that in both approaches the regularized la-

grangian couples left and right fermions and therefore also global chiral symmetry is

broken.

proving that it is possible to compensate the breaking due to the regularization by a

suitable choice of non-invariant counterterms in the lagrangian is an essential ingredient

of the renormalization procedure.

if the fermionic content of the theory ensures the

cancellation of the one-loop chiral anomaly, this ne-tuning problem has a solution. its

solvability is independent of the regularization procedure since the classication of all

possible anomalies is an algebraic problem [32]-[34].

we have appreciated in the previous chapters that the wilson renormalization group

70

chiral gauge theories and anomalies

formulation can be used to deduce the st identities in the yang-mills theory. we know

that, by properly xing the boundary conditions of the rg equation, the st identities

for the pure yang-mills theory with gauge group su(n) can be satised when all cutos

are removed (at least in perturbation theory). this has been shown both in terms of

the bare couplings of the eective action at the ultraviolet scale [4] and of the phys-

ical couplings [16]-[18].

in this case the possibility of solving the ne-tuning problem

is guaranteed by the fact that, once the renormalization conditions are imposed and all

cutos are removed, the renormalized green functions are independent of the regular-

ization procedure and, in particular, they coincide with those obtained via dimensional

regularization.

in this chapter we address the extension of the rg formulation to chiral gauge the-

ories. as in this case there is no regularization which preserves the symmetry, the rg

formulation has no disadvantages with respect to other procedures. as a matter of fact,

in the rg approach the space-time dimension is d = 4 so that there is no ambiguity in

the denition of the matrix 5 and in the regularized action left and right fermions are
not coupled. therefore the solution of the ne-tuning procedure is simpler than in the

standard cases (i.e. dimensional or lattice regularization), since the possible counterterms

must be globally chiral invariant. although there is no left-right coupling, we will show

that we obtain the correct chiral anomaly (if the matching conditions for the anomaly

cancellation are not fullled).

6.1 renormalization group ow and eective action

let us consider the su(n) chiral gauge theory described by the classical lagrangian (in

the feynman gauge)

where

scl = sy m + sf ,

sf =z d4x(cid:0) l i /d l + r i / r(cid:1)

(6.1)

(6.2)

and sy m was dened in eq. (5.1). the fermions l, r are in the fundamental rep-
resentation of the gauge group su(n). the action (6.1) is invariant under the brs

transformations [32] eq. (5.2) and

l =  cata l ,
with  a grassmann parameter.

 l =  l cata ,

 r = r = 0

6.1 renormalization group ow and eective action

introducing the sources  and  associated to the variations of  and , respectively

we get the brs action

i = {wa

we now implement the rg method. as usual the generating functional is given by

(1.2) and the cuto scalar products between elds and sources, introduced in eq. (1.3),

(6.5)

due to the breaking of gauge invariance caused by the cuto function in the prop-

agators, the uv action sint must contain all possible renormalizable interactions which
are needed to compensate the symmetry breaking induced by the regularization. these

are given by the monomials in the elds, brs sources and their derivatives which have

dimension not larger than four and are lorentz and su(n) scalars, since lorentz and

global chiral gauge symmetries are preserved by the cuto regularization. the indepen-

dent monomials of the yang-mills sector have been given in eq. (5.7). here we just recall

that in the su(2) case there are only one monomial with three gauge elds and two in-

dependent monomials with four gauge elds, while for su(3) only three monomials with

four gauge elds are independent. in the fermionic sector one has the ve monomials

l / l ,

r / r ,

l /aata l ,

 c l ,

l c  .

(6.6)

all these interactions appear in sint with couplings of non-negative dimension (relevant
parameters) which depend on 0. in order to obtain the physical theory we have to show
that these relevant parameters can be xed in such a way that:
(1) the 0   limit can be taken by xing the physical parameters such as the masses,
the coupling g and the wave function normalization constant at a subtraction point .

72

chiral gauge theories and anomalies

perturbative renormalizability ensures that this can be done [2, 4, 16] (for this reason the

dependence on the ultraviolet cuto 0 has been and will be sometimes understood).
(2) in the 0   limit the slavnov-taylor identities must be satised. for a chiral
gauge symmetry this requires that the gauge group is anomaly free or, more generally,

constrains the fermionic content of the theory. this is the crucial point we want to discuss

in this chapter.

6.1.1 boundary conditions: physical parameters and symmetry

the relevant part of the cuto eective action involves only monomials in the elds and

sources with dimension not larger than four

rel[, ; i()] =xi

i() pi[, ] ,

(6.7)

where the sum is over the monomials pi(, ) given in (5.7) and (6.6). the couplings i()
can be expressed in terms of the cuto vertices at a given subtraction point. thus we

need to extract the relevant part from a given functional with a non-vanishing subtraction

point. in chapter 2 and 5 we faced this problem for the scalar theory and the pure gauge

case, respectively. for the extraction of the relevant part of a given functional in a theory

with fermions see [51].

the remnant of the cuto eective action is the irrelevant part. since we expect the

theory to be renormalizable, the simplest boundary condition for it is

irr[, ;  = 0] = 0 .

for  = 0, then, the cuto eective action becomes local and corresponds to the bare
action sint in (1.2), with the bare couplings given by i(0).

in refs. [16, 17] the boundary conditions for these couplings are set at the physical

point  = 0. in this way some of the relevant couplings are related to physical couplings

such as the wave function normalizations and the three-vector coupling g at a subtraction

point . the remaining are xed imposing the symmetry at the physical point. this

procedure is highly not trivial since one has to analyse non-local functionals.

alternatively, we can discuss the symmetry at the ultraviolet scale and determine the

cuto-dependent i( = 0)s. this idea was described in details in chapter 3. in this
case the discussion is simpler, since all functionals are relevant and we have to perform a

perturbative calculation (i.e. to solve the rg equations) to obtain the physical couplings.

although the couplings i() are determined at  = 0, we still set the wave function

6.2 solution of  = 0 at  = 0

73

normalizations and the gauge coupling g at a subtraction point  at  = 0. as a matter

of fact there are combinations of the monomials in (6.7) which are not involved in the ne-

tuning, so that the corresponding couplings are free and can be xed at the physical point

 = 0. since we are already familiar with the implementation of the gauge symmetry in

the rg formulation, we jump to the solution of the ne-tuning at the uv scale.

6.2 solution of  = 0 at  = 0

in section 3.3 we showed that if ()
 is constant
and we can analyse it at an arbitrary value of . we also chose to perform such an

 = 0 at any loop order  < , then ()

analysis at the uv point, where the gauge symmetry condition determines the cuto-
dependent bare couplings. in g. 3.1 we represented the functional (0) at the uv
scale 0. a prominent feature of the su(n) theory is that in (5.22) the term proportional
to jl does not contribute since in [, ; 0] diagonal interactions between a eld and
its own source are absent.

we have seen before that the equation (1)

 (0) = 0 can solved by tuning some of
the relevant couplings in (1)(0) and we gave a practical example in sect. 5.3.1. as
a matter of fact, the ne-tuning equation (3.20) allows to compute the couplings in
(1)(0) since (1)
 (0) depends only on (0). at this loop order the line with the crossed
circle in g. 3.1 contributes only through a cuto function k00, since the additional full
propagator associated to this line cancels at this order (see (5.37)).

as in the pure ym case, the most general functional (0) contains the relevant

monomials given in (5.7) and (6.6) and can be split into two contributions

(1)(0) = (1)

inv(0) + (1)(0) ,

which xes the i(0)s whose niteness is shown by explicit calculation in the next
section. on the contrary the couplings zi(0) are not xed by the ne-tuning, so that
we are allowed to set them equal to their physical values at  = 0, i.e. zi(0) = 1. in the
standard language this corresponds to the renormalization prescriptions.

and is given in (5.43). we now derive the total fermionic (f) contribution, which is

represented in g. 1.

dierent forms of k00.

the ne-tuning equation (3.20), together with the results (6.12) and (6.14), allows to nd

the values of 1(0) and 2(0) which as a consequence depend on the cuto function.
the niteness of the results is due to the presence in (5.43) and (6.13) of the two cuto
functions having almost non-intersecting supports (i.e. q2 & 2

0, (q  p)2 . 2
0).

also in this case, in order to check our calculation we have computed these relevant

couplings at the physical point  = 0 using the evolution equation (1.16) and the corre-
sponding cuto function. in the limit 0   we nd 1(0) = 2(0) = 0, as required by
the ne-tuning equation at the physical point  = 0 [16]-[18].

chiral gauge theories and anomalies

the same analysis can be repeated for the other vertices of  in order to x the
remaining couplings i(0) in (6.10). also these couplings are nite, thanks to the same
argument discussed above. however, we prefer to concentrate to the computation of

the one-loop chiral anomaly, which yields a cuto-independent result. this will be the

subject of the following section.

6.3 the abj anomaly

the abj anomaly represents the breaking of the classical chiral symmetry at the quan-

tum level. one is obviously interested in theories where anomalies which aect currents

coupled to propagating gauge elds cancel. nevertheless they have to be computed in or-

der to test the consistency of the regularization procedure. in this section we concentrate

upon a single left fermion (recall that in our formulation right fermions are not coupled

to the gauge eld).

as the anomaly is absent at the tree-level, the ow equation (3.19) guarantees the

-independence of  at one loop. hence it may be convenient to compute the anomaly

at  = 0. there are two relevant monomials of , r d4x tr [c  (a  a)] and
r d4x tr [c  (a a a)], which are absent in  but may be present in . this

is due to the locality of (0), which in turn implies that  is a trivial cocycle of the
cohomology of the brs operator. in other words a violation of the st identity results
in the impossibility of xing the relevant couplings i(0) in (1)(0) in such a way the
symmetry is restored, or, equivalently, some of the relevant parameters in  cannot
be set to zero. nevertheless, a consistency condition for them still holds (wess-zumino

condition).

in the following we compute the fermionic contribution to  at one-loop order which
gives rise to the anomaly. taking the 0   limit in (5.37) and setting  = 0, 
becomes

and therefore is independent of the choice of the cuto function. as a consequence,
in the 0   limit, we recover the usual contribution to the anomaly, which is reg-
ularization independent. in the rg formulation this fact can be understood from the
independence of (1)

at the physical point  = 0. in this case the anomaly comes from  and is computed
in terms of the physical vertices of [, ;  = 0], which are regularization independent.

(6.26)

to sum up, in this chapter we have shown that, despite the loss of chiral gauge

invariance induced by the cuto, the slavnov-taylor identities can be perturbatively
recovered 1 by solving, at the uv scale, a ne-tuning equation which xes all the couplings

in the bare action except the ve zis. then we could exploit such a freedom by xing these
undetermined couplings at the physical point  = 0. in order to recover the complete

uv action, in addition to the ne-tuning procedure we have explicitly computed some

of the couplings which, apart from the zis, have turned out to be nite. this is similar
to what happens in dimensional regularization where the denition of the matrix 5
explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry by a term which lives in  dimensions (the so-

called evanescent vertex). once this vertex is inserted in primitively divergent feynman
diagrams (i.e. generating poles in ) it produces a nite contribution as   0. thus
additional nite counterterms must be introduced in order to restore the st identities.

this ne-tuning involves all possible relevant interactions, since the matrix 5 couples
left to right fermions. on the contrary in our formulation the regularization breaks local

1as long as the theory is anomaly-free!

80

chiral gauge theories and anomalies

gauge invariance but preserves global chiral symmetry, so that only globally invariant

monomials are involved in the ne-tuning, which, though unavoidable, is thus simplied

(the situation is even worse with lattice regularization due to the additional breaking of

lorentz invariance).

finally, with a simple one-loop calculation, we have reproduced the chiral anomaly,

which has proven to be universal, i.e. independent of the choice of the cuto function, as

it should.

the aim of this chapter is the extension of the rg formulation to supersymmetric theories.

our basic model will be the simplest supersymmetric theory that can be conceived,

namely the wess-zumino model [52].

as in non-supersymmetric theories, perturbative calculations in eld theories require

a regularization procedure to deal with ultraviolet divergences. a powerful and simple

method is that of dimensional regularization which has the remarkable feature of preserv-

ing gauge symmetry. however, it is clear that this regularization breaks supersymmetry,

since fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom match only in xed dimensions. the only

modication of dimensional regularization compatible with supersymmetry (the so-called

dimensional reduction [53]) turns out to be inconsistent [54]. the lack of a consistent

regularization scheme which manifestly preserves supersymmetry implies, in particular,

that superspace formalism can be used only with some care since naive manipulations

may lead to ambiguities [55]. although dimensional reduction does not seem to cause any

practical diculty and is extensively used [56] to perform perturbative calculations, it is

worthwhile to look for manifestly supersymmetric regularizations which take advantage

of the superspace technique [57] and are free of ambiguities.

now that the rg method has been successfully applied in a large variety of non-

supersymmetric models, our goal will be its generalization to supersymmetric theories,

implementing the regularization in such a way that supersymmetry is preserved. that

this program is practicable is easily understood recalling how the cutos are introduced

in the rg formulation: we split the classical action into two parts, the quadratic and

the interacting one, and then multiplies the former by a cuto function k0(p). hence,
in the supersymmetric case it suces to write the classical action in terms of superelds

and follow the same procedure (in components this corresponds to use the same cuto

82

the wess-zumino model

function for all elds). as our formulation works in d = 4, supersymmetry is maintained

and, from the very beginning, we can exploit the superspace technique, which simplies

perturbative calculations and is now unambiguous.

we begin with the set up the rg formalism for the massless wz model and then, as an

example of how to perform perturbative calculations, we compute the one-loop two-point

function and discuss the boundary conditions for the ow equation. our conventions are

given in appendix a.

7.1 the rg ow for the wess-zumino model

the massless wz model is described by the classical lagrangian [52]

scl = s2 + s(0)
int

where

s2 =

s(0)
int =

(7.1)

and  ( ) is a chiral (anti-chiral) supereld satisfying d  = 0 (d  = 0).

as we have done a number of times so far, we regularize ultraviolet divergences by

integrating out the elds with frequencies smaller than a given uv cuto 0 in the path
integral or, equivalently, we modify the free action to make the free propagators vanish
for p2 > 2
0.

the generating functional of the theory is

z[j] = eiw [j] =z d exp i(cid:8) 1

2(, d1)00 + (j, )00 + sint[; 0](cid:9) ,

where we have collected the elds and the sources in i = (, ) and ji = (j, j) respec-
tively, and introduced the general cuto scalar products between elds and sources

with k0(p) a cuto function which is one for 2 < p2 < 2

side 1. the introduction of such a cuto function in (7.3) yields a regularized propagator
1the factors d2/(16p2), d2/(16p2) are needed to write the chiral and anti-chiral superspace integral

respectively, as integrals over the full superspace (see the appendix a ).

which preserves supersymmetry, this being a global, linearly realized transformation.

hence the uv action sint[; 0] in (7.2) contains all possible renormalizable supersym-
metric interactions, i.e. superspace integrals of superelds and their covariant derivatives

which are local in . dimensional analysis tells us that they are given by the monomials
 ,  , 2 , 3,  , 2 , 3, properly integrated.

following wilson, we then integrate over the elds with frequencies 2 < p2 < 2
0
and rewrite the generating functional in terms of the wilsonian eective action se[; ]

eiw [j] = n[j; ]z d exp i(cid:8) 1

2(, d1)0 + (j, )0 + se[; ](cid:9) ,

(7.5)

where n[j; ] contributes to the quadratic part of w [j]. as usual, here and in the

following we explicitly write only the dependence on the cuto , since the theory is
renormalizable and we are interested in the limit 0   . as the regularization
preserves supersymmetry, the functional se contains all possible supersymmetric inter-
actions. we are well aware se can be interpreted as the generating functional of the
connected amputated cuto green functions  except the tree-level two-point function

 in which the free propagators contain  as an infrared cuto [11]. that is to say, the

functional

is the generator of the cuto connected green functions. the matrix d1
is dened
through (7.3) and its entries are d1
ij = 1/16 if i 6= j and zero otherwise. moreover,
in order to keep formulas more compact, we have introduced the two-component vector
k = (1,1) and the shortened notation d2  d2 which allow to treat simultaneously
chiral and anti-chiral elds.

7.1.1 evolution equation

from a conceptual point of view there is nothing to add to the procedure outlined in

sections 1.1, 1.2 to derive the rg ow for a supersymmetric model. however, if on

one side the introduction of covariant derivatives, projectors, etc. enables us to have

compact equations which will be directly exported in supersymmetric gauge theories,

on the other side some care must be taken in writing them. the requirement that the

generating functional (7.5) is independent of the ir cuto  gives rise to a dierential

84

equation for the wilsonian eective action, the well known exact rg equation [2, 4],

which can be translated into an equation for w [j; ]

(7.8)

the following step consists in introducing the cuto eective action which is given by

the legendre transform of w [j; ]

[; ] = w [j; ] z d4x d2 j z d4x d2  j  .

(7.9)

this functional generates the cuto vertex functions in which the internal propagators
have frequencies in the range 2 < p2 < 2
0 and reduces to the physical quantum eective
action in the limits   0 and 0   [11, 12, 14].

the evolution equation for the functional [; ] can be derived from (7.8) by us-
jj . as in (1.13), (1.14), this inversion can be

we will prefer writing all integrals in the full superspace, so that we have to cope with

an alternative denition of the theory which in principle is non-perturbative. as far as

we are concerned with its perturbative solution, the usual loop expansion is recovered

by solving iteratively (7.13). we have already pointed out such a solution is possible

since the l.h.s. of (7.13) at a given loop order depends only on lower loop vertices. the
proof of perturbative renormalizability, i.e. that the 0   limit can be taken, is a
straightforward generalization of that given in sec. 2.2 for non-supersymmetric theories

[2, 4, 11] .

7.2 relevant couplings and boundary conditions

we are familiar enough to relevant couplings to appreciate via dimensional analysis they
originate from the monomials  ,  , 2 , 3,  , 2 , 3, properly integrated.

the massless chiral multiplet two-point function (i.e. the  -coecient of the cuto

eective action)

2 ij(p; ) = d1

ij k 1

0(p) + 2 ij(p; )

(7.14)

contains the relevant coupling

zij() = 2 ij(p; ) |p2=2 ,

86

the wess-zumino model

where  is some non-vanishing subtraction point, whose introduction, being  a massless

eld, is required to avoid the ir divergences. additional relevant couplings are con-
tained in the 3, 3-coecients of the cuto eective action, i.e. 3(p, q,p  q; ) and
3 (p, q,p  q; ), and are dened by
3() = 3(p, q,p  q; ) |3sp ,

3() = 3 (p, q,p  q; ) |3sp .

we need not dene the remaining relevant couplings since the corresponding monomials

are not generated in perturbation theory.

all the vertices appearing with a number of   larger than one are irrelevant. fur-
ther contributions to the irrelevant part of  comes from the two-point and three-point

functions, and are given by

and

irr
2 ij(p; )  2 ij(p; )  zij() ,

irr
3(p, q,p  q; )  3(p, q,p  q; )  3()

irr
3 (p, q,p  q; )  3 (p, q,p  q; )  3() .

we assume that at the uv scale  = 0 all irrelevant vertices vanish. as a matter
of fact [;  = 0] reduces to the bare action, which must contain only renormalizable
interactions in order to guarantee perturbative renormalizability.

as to the relevant couplings, they are xed at the physical point  = 0 in terms of

the physical couplings, such as the wave function normalization, the three-point coupling

and the mass. hence the boundary conditions to be imposed on the relevant couplings

are

zij( = 0) = 0 ,

3( = 0) = 3( = 0) =  .

the evolution equation for the functional [] at one-loop order can be derived by writing
the r.h.s of (7.13) in terms of the known objects (0)
2 ij. one immediately realizes
that only the vertices with an equal number of  and  are generated at this order.

ij [] and (0)

as an example we compute the one-loop two-point function. the evolution equation
for this vertex is determined by the  -coecient in (7.13) which, at the tree level,
originates only from the second term in the r.h.s. of (7.12), i.e.

recalling the property

4(1  2) d2 d2 (4)(1  2) = 4(1  2) ,

(7.18)

we get

notice the crucial role of the boundary condition for zij, i.e. z (1)
ij (0) = 0, which naturally
provides the necessary subtraction to make the vertex function 2 ij nite for 0   .
conversely we can see from power counting that the remaining irrelevant vertices (i.e. the
coecients of ( )n with n > 1) are nite, and no subtraction is needed. this property
holds at any order in perturbation theory [11].

before switching to the analysis of the n = 1 super yang-mills theory, we should

comment on non-renormalization theorem for the wz model. in our framework it can

be derived with no substantial modication with respect to the standard proof [58].

88

the wess-zumino model

at the rst loop it is straightforward recognizing that chiral supereld interactions of

the type r d4x d2 (  + m 2 +  3) do not receive any nite or innite perturbative

contributions. as a matter of fact, inserting (7.12) at the tree level in (7.13) we can see

that only vertices with an equal number of chiral and anti-chiral elds acquire one-loop

corrections. however in the massless case there are violations to this theorem. in ref.
[59] it was explicitly shown that the chiral interaction 3 receives a nite contribution at

the two-loop level. in fact elementary power counting tells that this vertex stays nite

at any loop order. the same result can be derived in our formalism.

chapter 8

supersymmetric gauge theories

and gauge anomalies

the previous chapter was devoted to the implementation of the rg formalism in super-

symmetric theories. the wz model was our laboratory and we were able to regularize the

theory in such a way supersymmetry is preserved. this holds also for a supersymmetric

gauge theory, but in this case gauge symmetry is explicitly broken by the regulariza-

tion. as for non-supersymmetric gauge theories, we will show that by properly xing the

boundary conditions of the rg ow the st identity associated to the gauge symmetry

is recovered, when the matter representation is anomaly free. however, if the matching

conditions for the anomaly cancellation are not fullled, we will be able to reproduce the

chiral anomaly.

8.1 n = 1 super yang-mills

the super yang-mills (sym) action reads [60] (the conventions are those of [61])

ssym = 

1

128g2 tr z d4x d2 w w ,

w = d2(cid:0)egv degv(cid:1) ,

where v (x, ) is the n = 1 vector supermultiplet which belongs to the adjoint represen-
tation of the gauge group g. in the matrix notation v = v aa, with the matrices a
satisfying [a, b] = ifabcc , tr ab = ab. the classical action is invariant under the gauge
transformation

egv 

= ei egv ei ,

d  = 0 , d  = 0 ,

(8.1)

where  = aa.

90

supersymmetric gauge theories and gauge anomalies

in order to quantize the theory we have to x the gauge and choose a regularization

procedure. from what we have seen so far it should be manifest that the introduction

of the cuto does not spoil global symmetries as long as they are linearly realized. if

this is not the case the transformation of the quadratic part of the action mixes with the

transformation of the rest (recall that the cuto function multiplies only the quadratic

part of the classical action). therefore, we shall choose a supersymmetric gauge xing

instead of the familiar wess-zumino one in which the supersymmetry transformation is

not linear.

as described in ref. [57], we add to the action a gauge xing term which is a super-

symmetric extension of the lorentz gauge and the corresponding faddeev-popov term

the uv action sint[, ; 0] contains all possible relevant interactions written in terms
of i, i and superspace derivatives, which are invariant under lorentz and global gauge
transformations. notice that at the tree level all quadratic contributions in the elds and

sources are gathered in (8.4) and (8.5).

afterwards we integrate over the elds with frequencies 2 < p2 < 2

0 and the
result is the analogue of (7.5) where the wilsonian eective action se[, ; ] de-
pends also on the brs sources. the generating functional of the cuto connected

green functions w [j, ; ] is given by (7.6) and (7.7) with k the ve-component vector
k = (0, 1,1, 1,1) and the matrix d1
ij dened through (8.4). this matrix turns out
to be block-diagonal and its entries are 1/8(p2, ab, ab), a = (+,), with ab = ba
and + = 1. the derivation of the evolution equation for the functional w exactly
follows that of the wz model presented in sect. 7.1.1. finally the cuto eective action

8.1.1 matter elds

when adding matter elds to the pure super yang-mills action one gets sqcd, the su-

persymmetric generalization of qcd. matter is described by a set of chiral superelds

i(x, ) which belong to some representation r of the gauge group. their brs transfor-

mation reads

i =  ca

+ ta

i

j j  (c+)i ,

 i =  j ta

j

+  (  c+)i ,
i ca

where the hermitian matrices ta are the generators of the gauge group in the represen-
tation r.

the brs action for the matter elds is

smatter =

16zz

 egv ata z d4x d2  c+  +z d4x d2     c+

(8.7)

plus a possible superpotential w having the general form w () = 1
8m(ij)ij+(ijk)ijk,
the mass matrix mij and the yukawa coupling constants ijk being invariant symmetric

tensors in the representation r.

developing the rg formalism in presence of matter elds is straightforward once we

have replaced the sets of elds and sources with

i = (v, c+, c, c, c+ , ) ,
ji = (jv ,  + d2v , +, +,   d2v , j, j ) .

i = (v , c+ , c+ ,  ,  ) ,

(8.8)

the evolution equation for the eective action has the usual form (7.13), with a natural re-
denition of k and d1

ij to take into account matter elds (e.g. k = (0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,1)).

8.1.2 boundary conditions

as discussed in subsect. 7.2 we rst distinguish between relevant and irrelevant vertices.

the relevant part of the cuto eective action involves full superspace integrals of mono-

mials in the elds, sources and derivatives local in  and with dimension not larger than

8.1 n = 1 super yang-mills

two

i() pi[, ] ,

93

(8.9)

rel[, ; i()] =xi

where the sum is over the monomials pi[, ] invariant under lorentz and global gauge
transformations. due to the dimensionless nature of the eld v this sum contains innite

terms which can be classied according to the number of gauge elds. the couplings i()
can be expressed in terms of the cuto vertices at a given subtraction point, generalizing

the procedure used in subsect. 7.2 to dene the coupling zij() (see also [16]-[18] for the
technique of extracting the relevant part from a given functional with a non-vanishing

subtraction point in the non-supersymmetric yang-mills case).

as usual, the boundary condition we impose on the irrelevant part of the cuto

eective action, i.e. the remnant, is that it vanishes at  = 0. for  = 0, then, the
cuto eective action becomes local, i.e. an innite sum of local terms, and corresponds

to the uv action sint[, ; 0], with the bare couplings given by i(0).

the way in which the boundary conditions for the relevant couplings i() are deter-
mined is not straightforward and closely follows the procedure introduced in chapter 6

for chiral gauge theories. in sect. 7.2 we xed them at the physical point  = 0 in terms

of the value of the physical couplings (such us the normalization of the chiral eld). we

have seen that in the case of a gauge theory, as the one we are considering, there are

interactions in (8.9) which are not present in sbrs, so that only some of the relevant cou-
plings are connected to the physical couplings (such as the wave function normalizations

and the three-vector coupling g at a subtraction point ). for instance the contribution

to (8.9) with two gauge elds consists of three independent monomials

instead of the two in sbrs. therefore, in order to x the boundary conditions for all
the relevant couplings, we need the additional ne-tuning procedure which implements

the gauge symmetry at the physical point. however, this analysis involves non-local

functionals and is highly not trivial. alternatively we can discuss the symmetry at

the ultraviolet scale and determine the cuto-dependent i( = 0)s.
the discussion is simpler, since all functionals are relevant, but we have to perform a

in this case

perturbative calculation (i.e. to solve the rg equations) to obtain the physical couplings.

as we did for the chiral gauge theory, we consider the second possibility, although the

wave function normalizations and the gauge coupling g at a subtraction point  are still

set at  = 0. as a matter of fact there are combinations of the monomials in (8.9) which

94

supersymmetric gauge theories and gauge anomalies

are not involved in the ne-tuning, so that the corresponding couplings are free and can

be xed at the physical point  = 0. before explaining the details of the ne-tuning

procedure we recall how to implement the gauge symmetry in the rg formulation.

supersymmetric gauge theories and gauge anomalies

at any . the existence of such a limit is guaranteed in perturbation theory by the

uv niteness of the cuto eective action (perturbative renormalizability). in order to
show this property holds also for , it suces to recognize that the presence of cuto
functions having almost non-intersecting supports forces the loop momenta in (8.17) to
be of the order of . henceforth we will take the 0   limit in .

8.2.1 perturbative solution of  = 0

the proof of the st identity (8.15) in the rg formalism, with possible anomalies, is

based on induction in the loop number and closely follows that of non-supersymmetric

gauge theories discussed in chapters 3, 5, 6 [35, 36]. for the sake of completeness we

resume here the key issues.

we have shown that the evolution of the vertices of  at the loop  depends on
 = 0 at any loop order  < ,

vertices of  itself at lower loop order [26], so that if ()
then

()

 = 0 .

(8.19)

thus we can analyse  at an arbitrary value of . there are two natural choices
corresponding to  = 0 and  = r much bigger than the subtraction scale , i.e. r =
0. with the former the gauge symmetry condition xes the relevant part of the eective
action in terms of the physical coupling g() and provides the boundary conditions of

the rg ow, whereas with the latter the gauge symmetry condition determines the

cuto dependent bare couplings. with this choice the implementation of symmetry is
simplied due to the locality 2 of the functionals involved. although the computation of

physical vertices is generally cumbersome, this second possibility is more convenient in

the computation of quantities which do not evolve with the cuto , such as the gauge

anomaly. this is the reason why we will adopt the second possibility.

we now discuss the vanishing of . also for this functional we dene its relevant
part, isolating all supersymmetric monomials in the elds, sources and their derivatives
with ghost number one and dimension three. the rest is included in ,irr.

2here and in the following locality means that each term in the expansion of the functionals in the

gauge eld v contains only couplings with non-negative dimension.

8.2 eective st identity

97

at the uv scale  is local, or, more precisely, ,irr(0) = o( 1

), so that the
irrelevant contributions disappear in the 0   limit. this can be understood with
the same argument we gave in the non-supersymmetric case (see sec. 3.3). then (8.19)

0

ensures the locality of () at any .

once the locality of () is shown, the solvability of the equation () = 0
can be proven using cohomological methods [32, 34, 40]. this is a consequence of the

-independence of  and the solvability of the same equation at  = 0, where the
cohomological problem reduces to the standard one.

henceforth we will consider the rst loop, the generalization to higher loops being

straightforward due to the iterative nature of the solution. using (8.18), at  = 0 and
at the rst loop (8.15) reads

s(0) (1)(0) + (1)

,rel(0) = 0 .

(8.20)

this ne-tuning equation allows to x some of the relevant couplings in (1)(0). as a
matter of fact the most general functional (1)(0) can be cast into the form (8.9) and
split into two contributions

(1)(0) = (1)

inv(0) + (1)(0) ,

(8.21)

where inv contains all the independent monomials which are invariant, i.e. s(0) (1)
0. the explicit form of (1)

inv =
inv is obtained from sbrs in (8.3) and (8.7) with the replacement
(v , i , c+ , c+ , g ,  , )  (z1 v , z2 i , z2 c+ , z2 c+ , z3g , z4  , z4 ) .

the remaining monomials contribute to . inserting (8.21) into (8.20), we nd

s(0) (1)(0) =  (1)

 (0) ,

which yields the couplings in (1) since (1)
 (0) depends only on sbrs. an explicit
calculation shows that the only divergences are powers of 0 according to the dimension
of the relative vertex. in particular dimensionless couplings are nite, due to the presence
in (8.17) of cuto functions having almost non-intersecting supports 3.

as to the couplings zi(0), which are not involved in the ne-tuning, we are allowed to
set them equal to their physical values at  = 0, i.e. zi(0) = 1. in the standard language
this corresponds to the renormalization prescriptions.

instead of solving the ne-tuning equation and determine the (cuto-dependent) cou-

plings of the uv action, in the next section we will deal with the computation of the

3see sec. 5.3.1 for the explicit computation of some of these couplings in non-supersymmetric qcd.

supersymmetric gauge theories and gauge anomalies

gauge anomaly, which well illustrates how the method works and meanwhile is a cuto

independent result. at one loop such independence is guaranteed by the absence of the

anomaly at the tree level and by the evolution equation (8.19).

8.3 gauge anomaly

for n=1 sym within the superspace approach it has been demonstrated [40] that the

only possible anomaly is the supersymmetric extension of the standard adler-bardeen

anomaly [48] and its explicit form is given in ref. [62, 63]. as well known, its structure

is non-polynomial [62, 64] and can be expressed as an innite series in the gauge eld

v . in the following we restrict ourselves to the rst term of this expansion, since higher

order polynomials can be inferred [64] using the consistency condition [32, 34] which, at
this order, forces the one-loop anomaly a(1) to obey s(0)a(1) = 0.

in our framework a violation of the st identity results in the impossibility of xing the
relevant couplings i(0) in (1)(0) in such a way that (8.20) is satised. in other words,
this happens when there are relevant monomials in  which are not trivial cocycles of
the cohomology of the brs operator.

as a rst step we write  at one loop order. performing the 0   limit in (8.17)

and setting  = 0, we have

in (8.27) the structure proportional to p  does not contribute to the anomaly, basi-
cally because, in the coordinate space, all derivatives act on the same supereld. on the

other hand, had it played a role in determining the anomaly, like all other contributions

analyzed above, our method would have led to an inconsistent result, as i2 and the ais
depend on the cuto function. hence, only the term with q  can generate a genuine
anomaly. by setting i1 = 1/3 in (8.27) we get

which has the true structure of the anomaly.

the c+-v -v vertex of  can be derived repeating the steps described above. also in
this case we can identify the anomalous contribution by isolating its cuto independent

part, which turns out to be

(2)8

tr [c+(p  q, ) (cid:0)d d v (p, )(cid:1) q  v (q, )] .

(8.29)

finally, summing up (8.28) and (8.29), and switching to the coordinate space, the

anomaly has the well-known form

a =

g2

6144 2zz(cid:0) tr [c+ d dv {d, d }v ]  tr [c+ d d v {d, d }v ](cid:1) .

as a remark, we notice that in order to reproduce the standard abelian anomaly in non-

(8.30)

supersymmetric qcd we should perform the integration over the grassmannian variables,

identify the ghost c with c+ + c+ and replace g with 2g to recover the usual gluon-
fermion coupling (see eq. (8.7)). then we would nd that the coecient of the monomial
 tr [c aa] is exactly g2/(242).

in this chapter we have considered supersymmetric (gauge) theories within the rg

approach. although we restricted to the wz model and n=1 sym, the formalism is

developed in such a way it can be applied to any supersymmetric theory with an arbitrary

eld content and with extended supersymmetry. an advantage of the rg formulation

is that the regularization is implemented by introducing a cuto in the loop momenta

which makes all the green functions uv nite. this means one need not analytically

continue the feynman integrals in the space-time dimension d, which is kept xed (in

our case d = 4). therefore both the equality of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom

is safe a necessary condition for supersymmetry and the superspace technique presents

no ambiguity, for instance in handling the algebra of covariant derivatives, traces of 

matrices and using fierz identities.

102

supersymmetric gauge theories and gauge anomalies

unfortunately, in the rg approach the presence of the cuto explicitly breaks gauge

symmetry. this is an unavoidable consequence of the absence of a regularization scheme

that manifestly preserves both supersymmetry and brs invariance, which in turn is in-

timately related to the existence of the chiral anomaly. however, we showed that the

slavnov-taylor identity for the physical eective action of an anomaly-free theory is per-

turbatively recovered by solving the ne-tuning equation (8.15) at the uv scale. such

a procedure was sketched in subsect. 8.2.1. on the other hand, in case of unfullled

matching conditions for the anomaly cancellation, we have reproduced the supersymmet-

ric chiral anomaly by a simple one-loop calculation. we performed a one-loop analysis,

but the procedure systematically generalizes to higher order.

as well known, in the superspace formulation of sym one has to face with the problem

of infrared singularities, due to the appearance of the pseudoscalar eld c(x), the  = 0

component of the gauge supereld (this diculty is obviously circumvented in the wess-

zumino gauge [65], where the eld c is absent). to avoid this problem one can assume

[61] that all elds are made massive by adding suitable supersymmetric mass terms in

the action. since these masses break brs invariance, the corresponding slavnov-taylor

identity holds only in the asymptotic region of momentum space.

a prominent feature of our formulation is the presence of the ir cuto  which natu-
rally makes all cuto vertices ir nite for  6= 0. furthermore, for a non-supersymmetric
massless theory we have proven in sec. 2.3, by induction in the number of loops [66], that
the vertex functions without exceptional momenta are nite for   0, once the relevant
couplings are dened in terms of cuto vertices evaluated at some non-vanishing subtrac-
tion points. in this proof the convergence of loop integrals for   0 is simply controlled
by the number of soft momenta in the vertices which appear in the iterative solution of

the rg equation (7.13). therefore we believe its generalization to the supersymmetric

case presents no diculty.

finally, though we restricted our analysis to the perturbative regime, the rg formu-

lation is in principle non-perturbative and provides a natural context in which to clarify

the connection between exact results and those obtained in perturbation theory. in par-

ticular, it would be interesting to consider issues such as the anomaly puzzle and the

violation of holomorphicity [67] and reinterpret the recent results on these topics [68] in

the rg approach.

finally, in order to separate the trivial cocycles from the anomaly in (8.23), it can

be useful to switch to components. then for the non-supersymmetric ym sector the

anomaly is proportional to , which is generated by the following trace

tr [ ] = 2 (gg + gg  gg  i ) .
