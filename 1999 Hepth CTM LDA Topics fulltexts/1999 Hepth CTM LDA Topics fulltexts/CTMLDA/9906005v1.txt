summary.  the problem of 1-dimensional ultra-relativistic scattering of 2 iden-
tical charged particles in classical electrodynamics with retarded and advanced in-
teractions is investigated.

pacs 03.20  classical mechanics of discrete systems.
pacs 03.50  classical eld theory.

introduction

one of the unsolved problems in theoretical physics is hamiltonian and quantum
description of discrete relativistic systems with retarded and advanced interactions. such
systems result from exclusion of eld freedom degrees in eld theories: while expressing
elds by sources in classical eld theories, or performing integration by elds in generating
functionals of quantum eld theories (carried out at denite boundary conditions) nite-
dimensional theories arise, describing the motion of sources.

field exclusion in classical electrodynamics leads to wheeler-feynman system [1] 
a relativistic theory with nite number of freedom degrees, whose action is poincare-
invariant functional of world lines of charges. this theory is equivalent to classical
electrodynamics under the following boundary condition: eld emitted by a charge is
completely absorbed by other charges, so that outside some sphere (of radius greater
than the universe one) the resulting eld of charges vanishes. the given formulation of
electrodynamics has the following properties:

1. in wheeler-feynman electrodynamics a eld created by a point charge is a half-sum
of retarded and advanced potentials (dislike the standard approach, which uses only the
retarded potentials). consequently, the time reversion symmetry in this theory evinces
not only in the action, but also in solutions of equations of motion.

2. t-nonsymmetric eects like radiative damping arise in multibody problems and

have thermodynamic nature [1].

3. as the classical theory has nite number of freedom degrees, one should expect

that the corresponding quantum theory has no divergencies.

canonical quantization of wheeler-feynman electrodynamics has not been performed,
because hamiltonian formulation of this theory was unknown. moreover, lagrange equa-
tions of motion in wheeler-feynman electrodynamics are not ordinary dierential equa-
tions, but belong to a poorly investigated class of functional equations (dierential equa-
tions with deviating arguments [2]), that has no elaborate approaches to solution: neither
general analytical methods, nor steady numeric techniques. existence and uniqueness of
solutions for this class of equations have not been studied thoroughly. thats why a gen-
eral structure of solutions of classical electrodynamics in wheeler-feynman formulation
is still unknown.

particular results obtained in this domain are: solution uniqueness theorem for large
distances between charges [3]; exact solution of the problem for circular motion of charges
in the theory with retarded and advanced interactions [4], and the theory with retarded
interaction and radiative reaction [5]; exactly solvable modication of the problem [6],
with one charge inuenced by retarded interaction, and the other  by advanced one; nu-
merical solution of 1-dimensional 2-body problem [7], extended to velocities v < 0.9545c.

here we will continue the solution of the last problem to greater velocities. besides
that we will nd new solutions in the range of v < 0.9545c (along with those in [7]).
hamiltonian formulation of the theory constructed in [8] is used for the problem solution.

the paper has the following structure: the rst section describes the methods under
the use, the second one presents the obtained results. in three appendices boundary ef-
fects and limiting regimes are examined, and also a list of additional questions interesting
for further investigation is given.

1.  methods

0. we will consider one-dimensional scattering of two relativistic particles of equal charges
and masses. the methods used allow to study scattering of particles of dierent masses,
however, the case of identical particles is of the most interest due to additional symmetries
the problem acquires.

we use the following system of units: light velocity c = 1, classical radius of a particle

e2/mc2 = 1 (all distances are measured in classical radii).

1. a method described in [8] is used for the problem solution. the clue idea of the
approach is a choice of special parametrization of particles world lines, in which the
problem gets the following formulation (g.1). lets consider a system of particles xn, yn,
moving in 2-dimensional space-time so, that they are always located in vertices of a
polygonal line assembled of light rays. its enough to set a motion of particles x, and
dene y trajectories as y+
n+1( ) (in light coordinates x = x0 
x1). the motion is dened by a system of dierential equations for x
n ( ) (simultaneous
by  ), which is equivalent to the original one with deviating arguments. then additional
conditions are imposed onto the particles trajectories, ensuring their sewing together
to the whole paths of x and y particles. therefore, this approach reduces the problem
to a set of ordinary dierential equations, that denes particles evolution, and a set of
equations for initial conditions and evolution time of the form f (x) = 0, that provides
trajectories sewing together.

its possible to restrict calculations to a nite number of trajectories xn, n = 1...n .
this possibility follows from exponential increase of distance between particles with large
n: |xn  yn|  q2n, q = (1 + v)/(1  v), v  the velocity of the particles in center-of-
mass frame (cmf); and starting from some n , their interaction becomes negligible. as
q   while v  1, for large velocities few (n = 2, 3) steps of the light stairway
are sucient to move the particles out of the interaction region. thus, this method is
especially convenient in ultra-relativistic case (for small velocities more equations should
be considered).

the motion is dened by a system of hamiltonian equations for coordinates and

momenta:

phase trajectories lie on the surface h = const. in wheeler-feynman electrodynamics
only those trajectories, that lie on the surface h = 0, correspond to a physically mean-
ingful evolution. this constraint, causing the fact that not all momenta are independent,

arises due to parametrical invariance of the action and is typical for all relativistic the-
ories. e.g.
in a theory of free relativistic particle analogous constraint has a form of
a mass shell condition p2  m2 = 0, identically satised on all trajectories, because
p = m x/ x2 by denition.

the sewing conditions have the form

it has been shown in [8] that conditions (3) alone do not provide smoothness of

trajectories sewing. one more condition comes from the action minimum principle:

which is equivalent to smoothness of the yn and yn+1 trajectories sewing together. this
condition should be imposed for some n = 1...n  2, and together with (3) it will
provide smoothness of sewing together all xn, yn trajectories (except of the boundary
ones: x1,2, xn 1,n , see appendix a).

thus, (4n  4) equations (3),(4) and h = 0 are imposed on (4n + 1) unknowns
n (0), p
n (0), t ). among the remaining 5 freedom degrees, 4 correspond to trivial trans-

(x
formations of solutions:

 2 translations of solutions:

x  x + c;

 lorentz transformations:
x+  x+c, x  x/c;

p+  p+/c, p  pc;

 reparametrization (shift along the trajectories):

(x, p)

  (x, p)

 +c;

and one freedom degree corresponds to trajectories deformation in variation of relative
velocity of the particles.
2. the trivial freedom degrees can be eliminated, e.g. setting x
1 (0) = const
 a value of this constant can be taken from coulomb approximation (see below) and
xed in all further considerations. applying translations and lorentz transformation to
a solution found, one can move it to another reference frame, e.g. cmf.

1 (0) = 0, r

(1) for n = 1, n  1 two pn-conditions disappear, see [8]. also, in the action transforma-
tion (2)(4) in [8], carried out for nite trajectories, o-integral terms appear, resulting to
asymptotically vanishing corrections to the remaining two conditions.

in order to x reparametrization freedom degree, lets add one more equation: (x+

1 
1 )(0) = (x+
x
n )(t ) in cmf, geometrical interpretation of which is clear from g.2.
amongst all of parametrization xing constraints this one is especially convenient, be-
cause it prevents a solution from slipping o along a trajectory and ensures that
boundary points are distant from interaction region, both in the past, and in the future.

one more variable should be xed in the problem, e.g. r+

1 (0), it will control particles
velocities. the expression for v (initial velocity of particles x1, y1 in cmf) has the form:
v = 2(r+
1 (0))1  1, see [8]. its convenient to introduce a parameter  = (1  v)1
with range [1, +), and express r+
2 (0)).
thus, with the changes made, we have the system of (4n  4) equations f (, x) = 0
for (4n  4) unknowns x, depending on one parameter .
newtons method was applied to resolve this system. coulomb (non-relativistic) so-
lution of the problem at v = 0.5 was used as a starting point, it has the form (in the
designations introduced):

increased by , and the solution found was used as a starting point for new value of .
the step  was chosen adaptively: it was

 decreased by 2 times, if convergency has been lost;
 increased by 2 times, if solution has been found;

so  has been automatically kept in an optimal region(3).
3. with the help of these methods the solution was continued up to velocity v = 0.937.
at this value of velocity jacoby matrix of considering system degenerates (see g.3), and
newtons method becomes inapplicable. in fact, the solution extrapolation enables to
jump over this point and continue the solution (0) behind it. however, vanishing of
the jacobian indicates a change of topology for the set of solutions, therefore the vicinity
of this point should be studied by other methods.

lets extract in the jacoby matrix jij = fi/xj of size k  k, k = 4n  4, a
submatrix j of size (k  1)  (k  1), with determinant not-vanishing in the critical

variables and equations. now, xing (, x1), its possible to resolve (k  1) equations
fi(, x1, xj) = 0, i, j = 2...k, for (k  1) unknowns xj, using newtons method.
non-degeneracy of j guarantees that the solutions found are isolated: for xed (, x1)
in the vicinity of the solution xj there are no other ones. further, we get xj(, x1)
dependencies, carrying out step-by-step change of parameters (, x1), similar to the
described above. substituting these dependencies to the remaining equation, we get a
function of two variables f (, x1) = f1(, x1, xj(, x1)), a behavior of which is shown
on the g.4 (in terms of variables v, x1 = x1  x 0
at v < 0.937 the equation f (x1) = 0 has a single solution. in the critical point a
tangent to the graph at zero is horizontal (thats equivalent to det j = 0). at v > 0.937
the tangent slope reverses its sign and two additional solutions appear. thus, in the
critical point bifurcation of solutions takes place: one solution splits into three.

2.  the results

s.v.klimenko, i.n.nikitin, w.f.urazmetov

1. shapes of trajectories corresponding to found solutions are shown in g.5. while pass-
ing critical point no irregularities of trajectories and graphs of velocities and accelerations
are observed.

for the main branch (0) trajectories are symmetric with respect to spatial and tem-

poral reections p : x1  x1 and t : x0  x0.

for the additional branches () trajectories are not p - and t -symmetric, but trans-
form to each other in these reections. at the same time, these trajectories are p t -
symmetric.

this eect: violation of solutions symmetry for symmetrically stated problem is re-
lated with non-uniqueness of solutions. indeed, a symmetry of equations of motion (and
initial data) under reections means only that the reected solution is also a solution
(maybe another one), in other words, a set of solutions under reections transits to it-
self. only if a solution at the given initial data is unique (e.g. as for ordinary dierential
equations), one can conclude that the solution coincides with the reected one, i.e.
is
symmetric. thus, violation of p, t -symmetries for solutions is specic to dierential
equations with deviating arguments, which can have multiple solutions for the same
initial data.

2. the dependencies of parameters dm, tm on v are shown in g.6 (the denitions of
parameters see in g.5: dm = min x1  max y1 in cmf, tm  temporal distance between
the points, where extrema are reached).

the dependence dm(v) for the main branch of solution has minimum at velocity
vm = 0.956, corresponding to dm = 0.9075. this dependence (up to velocity value close
to vm) has been found in andersen and von baeyer work [7]. overlaying the graph [7]
to the one obtained here, we see their exact coincidence.

note. the following algorithm has been used in [7] for the problem solution. for a given path
of particle x the forces acting on it from a particle y were calculated, assuming path of the y is
a mirror reected image of path of the x. then the accelerations were integrated, corrections
to x trajectories were found, and the described process was iterated. first of all, lets note that
this algorithm considerably uses assumption about p -symmetry of the trajectories, therefore it
is only capable to obtain symmetrical solutions corresponding to the main branch (0). then
in order to nd a solution the described process was performed at a xed dm value, which
was diminished while moving to the range of greater velocities. the iterations converged till
dm = 0.9077 (that corresponds to v = 0.9545) and diverged for less dm values. this divergency
was caused by proximity of a minimum of dm(v) dependence  there are no solutions for
dm < 0.9075.

for v  1 solution in the main branch tends to hills solution [12], for which the
minimal distance between particles in cmf is dm = 1. the trajectories are polygonal
lines with vertices in points (0.5,0.5), see g.5. there are -like peaks on the acceler-
ations graphs corresponding to these vertices (see top right graph in g.7), one of them
corresponds to retarded, and another one  to advanced interactions.

for () solutions dm, tm  0 for v  1. the trajectories in cmf tend to light rays

emitted from the frame origin.

its interesting to investigate limiting shapes of the trajectories in reference systems,
where one of the particles has zero velocity at t  . there are two such systems
(see g.8), in one of them solution collapses to the frame origin, as in cmf. in the
other system another regime is established. the trajectories have small fractures (breaks
of smoothness), located in the points a, a. these fractures are related with -like
acceleration peaks, which correspond to the interactions of one type (in g.8  retarded
for x, and advanced for y). interaction of another type has smooth dependence on time
in ranges ca, ac  and denes trajectories shape in these intervals. its possible to give
analytical description of this shape, see appendix b.
3. poincare-invariance of action [8] follows to appearance of noethers motion integrals,
i.e. to the conservation of

in this approach momenta p

particles, see (2),(5). the terms (x
i+1  x
i )1 correspond to interaction contribution to
the integrals of motion, which is present in a standard approach [1] (emitted but still not
absorbed eld). the dierence from the standard approach is that integrals of motion
(6) comprise a sum over a sequence of points on the trajectories, linked by light stairway,
which propagates both to the future and to the past of the system.

conservation of integrals (6) has been used for the control of solutions accuracy in

numerical analysis, see [10] for details.

conclusion

the analysis of 1-dimensional scattering of 2 charges of equal masses in wheeler-
feynman electrodynamics has revealed splitting of solutions: the scattering is uniquely
dened by asymptotic velocities of the charges for v < 0.937c; for v > 0.937c there
are 3 dierent solutions. mirror reection symmetry is violated in the splitting: one of
three solutions is p -symmetric, the other two are not, but transit to each other under
p -reection. for limits of solutions at v  c analytical expressions have been derived.

boundary eects

1. sewing (3),(4) leads to appearance of fractures on the boundary parts of trajectories. a
physical reason of this eect is the following.

the equations of motion [8] have been derived minimizing the action, dened for nite
trajectories, see g.9. due to this fact the interaction between particles y and x switches
on/o instantaneously, potential of y particle eld has breaks at the points x2, xn . these
breaks correspond to -like lorentz force f , which causes trajectories fractures at the points
x2, xn . breaks of velocity at x2, xn leads to breaks of second derivatives at y2, yn1, and so
on. coecient at -function in f , which determines amplitude of these breaks, is proportional
to 1 and vanishes while    (n   or v  1). in the examined range of velocities the
eects caused by instantaneous switching of interaction appear to be small (a break of velocity
in fracture points is v < 5  104 for v > 0.9, v < 5  105 for v > 0.95, see [10]).

2. other schemes of interaction switching (e.g. continuation of trajectories by innite straight
lines) are able to remove the fractures. however, these techniques are less logical, as they do
not follow from the action minimum principle for nite trajectories. consideration of innite
trajectories in stairway parametrization is related with additional diculties, see [8].

3. for n = 3 only the last 2 equations remain in (3b); in (4) n = 1. the trajectories y1, y2 are
sewed together smoothly, fractures appear in sewing x1, x2, x3 trajectories together.
for n = 2 conditions (3b) are absent, instead of (4) one should use a condition

limiting regimes

1. a problem of particles motion, inuenced by interaction of one type (e.g. retarded for x and
advanced for y) is exactly solvable [6]. indeed, in light coordinates such a motion is described
by dierential equations, simultaneous by  = x, see g.10a.

the equations have the form:

x = y = ,

(in the equations (6) from [8] only terms corresponding to considered interaction are kept). the
solution is found by elementary methods:

x+(u) = a(f (u) + g(u)),

y+(u) = a(f (u)  g(u)),

x(u) = y(u) = ah(u),

the solutions (b.1) have the following important feature: for v  1 in zero velocity (laboratory)
frame, depicted in g.10b, the trajectories have polygonal shape.
interaction localizes in a
vicinity of fractures a, a. sewing this solution and p -reected one together in points b, b, a
limiting hills solution for the problem with interaction of both types is obtained, see g.10c.

lets consider extremal trajectories for interaction of the 1-st type (g.11a) and take into
account contribution of interaction of the 2-nd type. the trajectories regions, where particles
move at light velocity, give no contribution to the interaction of the 2-nd type, because this
interaction is suppressed by the factor (1  v)/(1 + v)  0 for v  1 (see (6) in [8]). in the
internal intervals ca, ac  the interaction of the 2-nd type does not vanish, these trajectory
regions have the shape, described by eq.(b.1), transformed by p -reection (x, y)  (y, x) and
transformations (b.2). outer intervals are straight and are sewed with internal ones smoothly
in points c, c , while in points a, a there are breaks of slope, of the same amplitudes as those
in g.11a.

thus, on internal intervals the solution has the form

(b.3)

x = a(f  g)/c,

y = a(f + g)/c,

x+ = y+ = ahc.

(we have excluded translations d from transformations (b.2) and further consider solutions
symmetric w.r.t. frame origin. a more thorough analysis shows that there are no solutions with
d 6= 0). requirements of sewing with straight trajectory regions have the form:

x+(u) = 1,

x(u) = 0,

dx+
dx (u) = 1 (point a in g.11b) 

(b.4)

c = 1/a(v)h(u), f (v, u)  g(v, u) = 0, g =

1  v2

(1  vu)2a(v)2h(u)2  1 = 0.

the function x(u) in the interval 1 < u < 1 monotonically increases from  to +, thus
the second equation in (b.4) can be unambiguously resolved for u (with v xed). finding this
solution numerically and substituting it to the third equation, we plot g(v) function graph, see
g.12.

the equation g(v) = 0 has the following solutions(4):
1) v  1 corresponds to hills solution.
2) v = 0.6087622455403174 (u = 0.867439322472601, c = 0.5948623884508324) corresponds to
limit of solution (+). in order to transform this solution to laboratory reference frame g.11c,
lets dene the coecient

c =(cid:18) dx+

dx (u)(cid:19)1/2

, where x+(u) = 1 corresponds to point c on g.11b.

solving the last equation, we nd u = 0.8674393224726012, c = 3.2378655431429. carrying
out lorentz transformations with coecient c on the trajectories, we get limiting solution,
depicted in top right of g.8.
3) v = 0.9437848540619277 (u = 0.9998999343906364, c = 0.1703458543931005), the solution
is presented in g.13. in the reference system g.11b this solution is close to hills one. small
(1%) discrepancies of these solutions in the interaction region are observed only in vicinities of
points c, c  (also there is a small discrepancy of the solutions far from the interaction region,
caused by dierence of velocities vx for these solutions).
in the laboratory reference system
g.11c non-trivial limiting shape establishes for this solution as well (correspondent coecient
c = 34.5179309569148). for transition to reference systems, where vx  1, coecient c  0

is required. this, particularly, means that in cmf at v  1 this solution collapses to the frame
origin.

our hypothesis: for large v the solution (0) undergoes one more bifurcation. as a result 3
solutions appear, one of them tends to hills solution at v  1, while the others to new found
solution and its p -adjoint. the form of det j(v) dependence (see g.13) conforms to existence
of root near v = 0.9995. the presented techniques can not continue the solution to velocities
v > 0.999, due to computational diculties described in [10].

appendix c.

proposal for further investigation

the main result of our work consists in the discovery of a fact, that the system considered
has the same number of freedom degrees as its non-relativistic analog (a system of two particles
on a line, interacting via potential forces).

in both cases the shape of the trajectories on a plane (x, t) depends only on particles
asymptotic velocities (in our problem is dened by it uniquely for v < 0.937 and three-way-
ly for v > 0.937). phase space of hamiltonian theory in the studied problem is essentially
4-dimensional, as well as in non-relativistic case. the phase space structure (both topological,
and symplectic), however, for these cases considerably diers. the scheme for construction of
reduced phase space for the considered problem looks like the following.

the set of constraints (including h = 0 and sewing requirements) extracts 5-dimensional
surface in extended phase space (x, p)
n. this surface looks like s5 = 1  p3  t1, where
1 = x()  the found branchy curve(5), p3  poincare group, t1  group of shifts along
the trajectories. reduction of symplectic form dp
n from extended phase space onto this
surface follows to symplectic form, degenerate along the t1 (solutions shifts are generated by
hamiltonian h, included into the full set of constraints). factorization s5 by t1 (or imposition
of gauges like   x+
1 ) gives 4-dimensional phase space s4 = 1  p3, where the reduced
symplectic form denes poisson brackets.

in further investigations of the given problem its interesting to carry out:

1. calculation of poisson brackets for independent variables and construction of canonical basis
in the obtained hamiltonian mechanics.
2. a study of non-symmetrical problem m1 6= m2. the fact that the branches x (0,)() of
found solution are sewed together in one point of phase space is related to the symmetries of the
problem. for m1 6= m2 in a vicinity of critical point recombination and formation of disjoint
branches of solution are possible (see g.14).
3. calculation of second variation of the action to investigate its extrema. necessity of such
investigation consist in the following. lets consider smooth function f : rn  r, which has
k > 1 extrema in rn. in this case all extrema can not be minima, there should be extrema of

other type among them (maxima or saddles). one should expect that not all of found solutions
of the problem correspond to minimum of action, there should be extrema of other types as
well.
4. investigation of system responses to external perturbations and analysis of causal properties of
the system. as advanced interactions can lead to violation of causality principle, its interesting
to answer the following question: can an observer related to one of the trajectories detect the
external inuence on it before it takes place? in the case of causality violation one should
estimate the magnitude of the eect.
