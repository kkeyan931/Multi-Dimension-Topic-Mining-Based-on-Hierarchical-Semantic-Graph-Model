abstract. in the rst part of this paper i review the construc-
tion of the realistic free fermionic models, as well as current
attempts to study aspects of these models in the nonpertur-
bative framework of m and ftheories.
i discuss the recent
demonstration of a minimal superstring standard model, which
contains in the observable sector, below the string scale, solely
the mssm charged spectrum, and provides further support to
the assertion that the true string vacuum is connected to the
z2  z2 orbifold in the vicinity of the free fermionic point in the
narain moduli space. in the second part i review the recent for-
mulation of quantum mechanics from an equivalence postulate,
which oers a new perspective on the synthesis of gravity and
quantum mechanics, and contemplate possible relations with
string theory and beyond.

1. introduction

superstring phenomenology aims at achieving two goals. the rst task is
to reproduce the phenomenological data provided by the standard particle
model. the subsequent goal is to extract possible experimental signatures

which may provide further evidence for the validity of specic string mod-
els, in particular, and for string theory, in general. one should however note
that, in the lack of substantial experimental evidence for any extension of
the standard model, the conservative approach would be to derive solely
the standard model, which we may assume to include nonvanishing neu-
trino masses. experimental signatures beyond the standard model become
rm theoretical predictions once the rst goal is achieved and it appears
that something extra unavoidably remains.

despite its experimental success, the standard model leaves much to
be desired. in the rst place the standard model is made of several dis-
parate sectors. these include the matter, the interaction, and the higgs,
sectors. the higgs sector is still unobserved experimentally and the least
understood. the matter and interaction sectors are made of similar but
distinct elements, like the dierent gauge groups of each interaction and
the multiplicity of generations, which are parametrized by various param-
eters. this enumeration is clearly unappealing and it is reasonable to seek
a more economical description. the most important guide in this quest is
the multiplet structure of the standard model, which is exhibited below,

the matter and gauge multiplets of the standard model amazingly t
into representations of larger unifying gauge groups [1]. most appealing is
the framework of so(10), in which all the standard model states (includ-
ing the righthanded neutrinos which are desirable for neutrino masses and
oscillations), in each generation, are embedded in a single representation.
a priori there was no reason for this to have been the case. but strik-
ingly all three generations t, each, into a fundamental representation of
so(10). if we regard (as we should) the quantum numbers of the standard
model states as experimental observables, then this scheme correlates 18
observable parameters. it seems to me therefore that to deny the evidence
for the underlying so(10) structure of the standard model is synonymous
to dismissing the standard model itself.

an important experimental fact is the unobservation of proton decay. in
the standard model the proton decay is forbidden by renormalizability and
accidental global symmetries. in general, extensions of the standard model

2

produce proton decay mediating operators. in nonsusy guts proton
decay is mediated by dimension six operators. in supersymmetric theories
dimension four and ve operators are also generically allowed. proton
decay becomes an especially acute problem when gravity is unied with
the gauge interactions because in that case renormalizability and global
symmetries are not expected to be respected. in this context therefore it is
expected that proton stability can only be maintained if there exist a gauge
symmetry, which after its breaking still leaves a residual discrete symmetry,
which forbids proton decay [2]. this is very hard and nontrivial to achieve.
the evidence for unication, provided by the standard model multiplet
structure, together with proton longevity, indicate that the standard model
cannot be strongly perturbed up to a very large scale.
it is dicult to
envision how a strong perturbation of the standard model at a low scale
will not run into conict with the proton lifetime. these experimental facts
therefore indicate the big desert scenario.

unication and the big desert scenario is then supported by another
observation. namely, if one extrapolates the standard model gauge cou-
plings, they are seen to converge at a high scale, which is one or two orders
of magnitude below the heterotic string scale [3]. this picture is especially
appealing in the case of supersymmetric theories, where the couplings are
seen to meet at a scale which is of the order of 1016gev [4]. this extrap-
olation should be taken as qualitative support for the consistency of the
big desert scenario. the appealing feature of supersymmetric theories is
the fact that when the symmetry is local it necessitates the appearance
of a spin two eld. we then see that the gauge and gravitational interac-
tions start to converge into a unifying setting. furthermore, this setting
also provides the means to understand how a very small scale such as the
electroweak scale can be generated by extrapolation from the planck scale.
despite their enormous success point quantum eld theories still leave
many questions unresolved. why is a particular gauge group observed at
low energies, together with the multiplicity of generations ? the prolif-
eration of standard model parameters, in particular in the avor sector,
and the hierarchy between them does not have its origin in guts or susy
guts. to understand these issues we must incorporate gravity into the
picture. most importantly, point quantum eld theories do not provide
for a consistent formulation of quantum gravity. a consistent formulation
of quantum gravity requires new conceptual framework and tools. such a
framework will then also shed light on the structure of the standard model.
string theory provides a consistent perturbative formulation of quantum
gravity. string theory is unique in the sense that it is the only approach
to date which gives a consistent common framework for both gravity and
the gauge interactions. as such string theory exactly suits our purpose,
i.e. it provides the tools to study how the standard model structure and

3

parameters may arise from a theory of quantum gravity.

string theory is dened in perturbation theory. as such it is clear that
string theory cannot be the nal story. indeed, over the last few years an
important new understanding has emerged in which it is seen that all the
dierent string theories in ten dimensions are in fact perturbative limits of
a single theory. this is a very encouraging picture because it tells us that
by utilizing string perturbation theory we are truly probing the underlying
nonperturbative theory. now suppose that the situation was reversed and
we rst had in our hands the full nonperturbative formulation. it is likely
that in that case what we would have done in order to study its connection
with the real world is to develop perturbation theory in the vicinity of its
most relevant limits.

2. superstring constructions

there are two complementary approaches to superstring phenomenology.
in one, the general strategy is to rst try to understand what is the nonper-
turbative formulation of string theory. the hope is that the unique string
vacuum will be xed and the low energy predictions unambiguously deter-
mined. the second, asserts that we must use low energy data to single out
phenomenologically interesting superstring vacua. such string models will
then be instrumental to understand the dynamics which select the string
vacuum. these two approaches are in a sense complementary and progress
is likely to be made by pursuing both approaches in parallel.

the general goal is therefore to construct superstring models that are
as realistic as possible. a realistic model of unication must satisfy a large
number of constraints,

2. contains three generations
3. proton stable
4. n=1 supersymmetry

no free exotics

it is important to emphasize that the so(10) structure, advocated
above, need not be realized in an eective eld theory but can be bro-
ken directly at the string level. in which case the standard model spec-
trum still arises from so(10) representations, but the so(10) nonabelian
spectrum, beyond the standard model, is projected out by the gso pro-
jections. however, if we take the standard model so(10) embedding as
a necessary requirement this means that the weak hypercharge must have
the standard so(10) embedding with ky = 5/3. this requirement then
already excludes many of the semi-realistic models, which have been con-
structed to date. similarly, the requirement that no free exotic particles
with fractional electric charge remain in the massless spectrum imposes a
highly nontrivial constraint on otherwise valid models. the phenomeno-
logical constraints impose very restrictive constraints on the superstring
constructions. this is augmented by the fact that, unlike in eld theory
model building, in string model building both the entire spectrum and sym-
metries are xed in a given vacuum. one does not have the freedom to
add an additional u (1) or discrete symmetry, or additional matter, to suit
one needs. therefore, string model building is more restrictive than eld
theory model building. a string model that can satisfy all of the above
requirements is likely to be more than an accident.

there are several possible ways to try to construct realistic superstring
models. one possibility is to construct superstring models with an interme-
diate gut, or semigut gauge group, like su (5), so(10), e6, etc [5], or
su (3)3 [6], su (5) u (1) [7] or so(6) so(4) [8], which are broken to the
standard model gauge group at an intermediate energy scale. the other
possibility is to construct superstring models in which the nonabelian fac-
tors of the standardmodel gauge group are obtained directly at the string
level [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. the advantage in the second case, as well as in
the patisalam type models, is that in these cases the color higgs triplets,
which mediate proton decay through dimension ve operators, can be pro-
jected out by the gso projections. such models then provide a superstring
solution to the gut hierarchy problem [14].

with the advent of superstring duality arguments we can use the dif-
ferent perturbative string limits to try to construct realistic string models.
these are all supposedly connected by duality relations and a model in one
limit should have a dual model in another limit. interesting alternatives to
the heterotic string are the type i constructions, which allow the unication
scale to be lowered as the gauge and gravity multiplets in this case do not
arise from the same sector. however, the heterotic string framework still
remains the most appealing as it is the only one which naturally gives rise
to so(10) multiplets in the 16 representation.

5

the construction of realistic superstring vacua proceeds by studying
compactication of the heterotic string from ten to four dimensions. var-
ious methods can be used for this purpose which include geometric and
algebraic tools, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. one
class of models utilizes compactications on calabiyau 3folds that give
rise to an e6 observable gauge group, which is broken further by wilson
lines to su (3)3 [6]. this type of geometrical compactications correspond
at special points to conformal theories which have (2, 2) worldsheet su-
persymmetry. similar compactications which have only (2,0) worldsheet
supersymmetry have also been studied and can lead to compactications
with so(10) and su (5) observable gauge groups [15]. the analysis of this
type of compactication is complicated due to the fact that they do not
correspond to free worldsheet theories. therefore, it is dicult to cal-
culate the parameters of the standard model in these constructions. on
the other hand they provide a sophisticated mathematical window to the
underlying geometry.

the next class of superstring vacua are the orbifold models [16]. here
one starts with a compactication of the heterotic string on a at torus,
using the narain prescription [17], and utilizes free worldsheet bosons.
the narain lattice is moded out by some discrete symmetries which are
the orbifold twisting. an important class of models of this type are the z3
orbifold models [9]. these give rise to three generation models with su (3)
su (2)u (1)n gauge group. a deciency of this class of models is that they
do not give rise to the standard so(10) embedding of the standard model
spectrum. consequently, the normalization of u (1)y , relative to the non
abelian currents, is larger than 5/3, the standard so(10) normalization.
this results generically in disagreement with the observed low energy values
for sin2 w (mz) and s(mz ).

a special type of string compactications that has been studied in detail
are the free fermionic models. the simplest examples correspond to z2z2
orbifolds at special points in the compactication space. these models give
rise to the most realistic superstring models constructed to date. they pro-
duce three generation models with the standard so(10) embedding of the
standard model spectrum. hence in these models u (1)y has the stan-
dard so(10) embedding, with ky = 5/3. consequently these models can
be in agreement with the observed low energy values for sin2 w (m ) and
s(mz). there are several key features of these models which suggest that
the true string vacuum is in the vicinity of these models. first is the fact
that the free fermionic models are formulated at a highly symmetric point
in the string compactication space. the second is that the emergence of
three generations is correlated with the underlying structure of the z2 z2
orbifold compactication [18]. each of the standard model generations is
obtained from one of the twisted sectors and carries horizontal charges un-

6

der one of the orthogonal planes of the z2z2 orbifold. these models then
give a reason for the existence of three generation in nature, as originating
from the structure of the underlying geometry.

3. free fermionic models

a model in the free fermionic formulation [19] is dened by a set of bound-
ary condition basis vectors, and oneloop gso phases, which are con-
strained by the string consistency requirements, and completely determine
the vacuum structure of the models. the physical spectrum is obtained
by applying the generalized gso projections. the yukawa couplings and
higher order nonrenormalizable terms in the superpotential are obtained
by calculating correlators between vertex operators [20]. the realistic free
fermionic models produce an anomalous u (1) symmetry, which generates
a fayetiliopoulos dterm [22], and breaks supersymmetry at the planck
scale. supersymmetry is restored by assigning non vanishing vevs to a
set of standard model singlets in the massless string spectrum along at f
and d directions. in this process nonrenormalizable terms,

become renormalizable operators,

in the eective low energy eld theory.

the rst ve basis vectors of the realistic free fermionic models consist of
the nahe set [21, 11, 18]. the gauge group after the nahe set is so(10)
e8  so(6)3 with n = 1 spacetime supersymmetry, and 48 spinorial
16 of so(10), sixteen from each sector b1, b2 and b3. the three sectors
b1, b2 and b3 are the three twisted sectors of the corresponding z2  z2
orbifold compactication. the z2  z2 orbifold is special precisely because
of the existence of three twisted sectors, with a permutation symmetry with
respect to the horizontal so(6)3 symmetries. the nahe set is depicted
in the table below which highlights its cyclic permutation symmetry.

the nahe set is common to a large class of three generation free
fermionic models. the construction proceeds by adding to the nahe set
three additional boundary condition basis vectors which break so(10) to
one of its subgroups, su (5)  u (1), so(6)  so(4) or su (3)  su (2) 
u (1)2, and at the same time reduces the number of generations to three,
one from each of the sectors b1, b2 and b3. the various three generation
models dier in their detailed phenomenological properties. however, many
of their characteristics can be traced back to the underlying nahe set
structure. one such important property to note is the fact that as the
the generations are obtained from the three twisted sectors b1, b2 and b3,
they automatically possess the standard so(10) embedding. consequently
the weak hypercharge, which arises as the usual combination u (1)y =
1/2u (1)bl + u (1)t3r , has the standard so(10) embedding. to date,
of the orbifold models that have been constructed, only the free fermionic
models have yielded such a structure.

the massless spectrum of the realistic free fermionic models then generi-
cally contains three generations from the three twisted sectors b1, b2 and b3,
which are charged under the horizontal symmetries. the higgs spectrum
consists of three pairs of electroweak doublets from the neveuschwarz sec-
tor plus possibly additional one or two pairs from a combination of the two
basis vectors which extend the nahe set. additionally the models con-
tain a number of so(10) singlets which are charged under the horizontal
symmetries and a number of exotic states.

exotic states arise from the basis vectors which extend the nahe set
and break the so(10) symmetry. consequently, they carry either fractional
u (1)y or u (1)z  charge. such states are generic in superstring models and
impose severe constraints on their validity. in some cases the exotic frac-
tionally charged states cannot decouple from the massless spectrum, and
their presence invalidates otherwise viable models.
in the nahe based
models the fractionally charged states always appear in vectorlike repre-
sentations. therefore, in general mass terms are generated from renormaliz-
able or nonrenormalizable operators. however, the mass terms which arise
from nonrenormalizable terms will in general be suppressed, in which case
the fractionally charged states may have intermediate scale masses. here i

8

describe the analysis of a model in which all the fractionally charged states
decouple from the massless spectrum at the cubic level of the superpotential
and receive mass of the order of the string scale.

4. minimal superstring standard model

the superstring model under consideration [10] is a typical three gener-
ation free fermionic model. it is generated by the naheset plus three
additional basis vectors {b4, , }, where b4 preserves the so(10) sym-
metry,  breaks so(10)  so(6)  so(4) and  breaks so(6) 
so(4)  su (3) su (2) u (1)2. the massless spectrum consist of three
generations from the sectors b1, b2 and b3, the neveuschwarz (ns) sector
produces, the gravity and gauge multiplets, three pairs of electroweak dou-
blets {h1, h2, h3, h1, h2, h3}, seven pairs of so(10) singlets with observable
u (1) charges, {12, 12, 23, 23, 13, 13, 56, 56, 
4},
and three scalars that are singlets of the entire four dimensional gauge
group, 1, 2, 3. the states from the ns sector and the sectors b1,
b2 and b3 are the only ones that transform solely under the observable,
su (3)c  su (2)l u (1)bl  u (1)t3r  u (1)1,,6 gauge group. the sec-
tors (i)+ b1,2,3,4 + 2 produce so(10) singlet matter states in the 16 vector
representation of the hidden so(16) gauge group, decomposed under the -
nal hidden group. the sectors with some combination of {1, b1, b2, b3, b4, }
plus  or 2 produce states that are su (3)c  su (2)l singlets, but carry
fractional charge under u (1)y , u (1)z  , or u (1)em. these exotic states,
which do not t into so(10) representations, arise due to the so(10) sym-
metry breaking, by the basis vectors  and , and carry fractional electric
charge 1/2 or fractional u (1)z  charge. the full massless spectrum and
charges are given in ref. [10, 23].

in the model of ref.

[10] it is noticed that all the fractionally charged
states couple at the cubic level of the superpotential to the set of so(10)

where fatness imposes (4

at f and d solutions, which incorporates the set of elds {4, 
4}.
in the last couple of years the search for f and d at solutions in su-
perstring models was systematized [25], following similar developments in
supersymmetric eld theory models. applying these methods to the model
of ref.
[10] we indeed found solutions with the desired properties. one
example is given by the set of elds,

4, 4, 

{12, 23, 56, 4, 

4, 4, 

4, h15, h30, h31, h38}.

9

furthermore, it was shown that with this solution also the extra higgs
multiplets, beyond the mssm, as well as an additional pair of higgs triplets
receive mass by the same set of vevs from cubic and quintic order terms.
therefore, in this solution, we have in the observable sector, solely the
mssm charged spectrum. moreover, the f and d at solutions have been
completely classied and it was shown that solutions with such properties
are in fact abundant, which encourages the prospect for obtaining realistic
values for the standard model parameters. another important property
of the f and d at solutions is that the set of vevs necessarily includes
elds that break the u (1)z  , which is embedded in so(10). thus, in this
case so(10) symmetry is necessarily broken directly to su (3)csu (2)l
u (1)y . finally, the model of ref. [10] supplemented with the at f and d
solutions provides the rst example in the literature with solely the mssm
charged spectrum below the string scale. thus, for the rst time we have
an example of a longsought minimal superstring standard model !

5. phenomenology

the model of ref. [10] and its success in the terms of producing solely the
mssm charged spectrum at low energies, should be viewed as a prototype
example of a realistic free fermionic model. the lesson that should be ex-
tracted is that the underlying structure of these models, provided by the
nahe set, produces the right features for obtaining realistic phenomenol-
ogy. it provides further evidence for the assertion that the true string vac-
uum is connected to the z2z2 orbifold in the vicinity of the free fermionic
point in the narain moduli space. with this in mind we note that many of
the important issues relating to the phenomenology of the standard model
and supersymmetric unication have been addressed in the past in sim-
ilar prototype free fermionic heterotic string models. these studies have
been reviewed in the past and i refer to the original literature and review
references [26]. these include among others: top quark mass prediction
[12], several years prior to the actual observation by the cdf/d0 collab-
orations; generations mass hierarchy [27]; ckm mixing [28]; superstring
seesaw mechanism [29]; gauge coupling unication [30]; proton stability
[14]; and supersymmetry breaking and squark degeneracy [31].

6. exotic signatures

after establishing the phenomenological viability of
free fermionic
heteroticstring models, it makes sense to seek possible experimental sig-
nals that may provide evidence for specic models in particular, and for
string theory in general. this is in essence a secondary task as the rst duty

10

is to reproduce the parameters of the standard model. obtaining the full
structure of the standard model from a string model will be an everlasting
achievement. with this in mind there are several possible exotic signatures
that have been discussed in the past. these include the possibility of ex-
tra u (1)s [32]; specic supersymmetric spectrum scenarios [33]; rparity
violation [34]; and exotic matter [35]. rparity violation is an intriguing
but somewhat remote possibility. the problem is that in string models if
rparity is violated at the same time one expects to get fast proton de-
cay. the model of ref.
[36] provides an example how rparity violation
can arise in superstring theory. this string model gives rise to custodial
symmetries which allow lepton number violation while forbidding baryon
number violation.

the second possibility is that of exotic matter, which arises in super-
string models because of the breaking of the nonabelian symmetries by
wilsonlines. it is therefore a unique signature of superstring unication,
which does not arise in eld theory guts. while the existence of such
states imposes severe constraints on otherwise valid string models [13], pro-
vided that the exotic states are either conned or suciently heavy, they
can give rise to exotic signatures. for example, they can produce heavy
dark matter candidates, possibly with observable consequences [37].

7. toward m(f)theory embedding

over the past few years a remarkable new understanding of string theory
has emerged. in this picture all the ten dimensional perturbative string
theories as well as 11 dimensional supergravity are all perturbative limits
of a single theory, referred to as m (or f) theory [38]. in ref. [40] we have
undertaken the task of trying to understand how the phenomenological free
fermionic models may t in the nonperturbative framework of m(f)theory.
as discussed above the nahe set, which corresponds to z2  z2 orbifold
compactication, plays a pivotal role in the realistic free fermionic models.
its correspondence with a z2  z2 orbifold is made more explicit by adding
to the nahe set an additional boundary condition basis vector x [18],
which extends the so(10)  so(6)3 symmetry to e6  u (1)2  so(4)3.
this model contains (27,3) multiplets in the (27, 27) representations of
e6. the same model is generated in the orbifold language by moding out
an so(12) narain lattice by a z2  z2 discrete symmetry with standard
embedding [18]. the fermionic z2  z2 orbifold model diers from the one
which has usually been examined in the literature, with (h11, h21) = (51, 3),
which corresponds to twisting of an so(4)3 lattice. many discussions on
ftheory have focused on compactications on the (51,3) z2  z2 calabi
yau 3fold to six dimensions. the rst task then is to connect the (51,3)
model to the (27,3) model, and then to implement this connection in the

11

ftheory compactication on the (51,3) model. it should be emphasized
that the aim here is not to extract direct phenomenological data from these
investigations. the goal is rather to try to bridge between basic structures
which appear in the phenomenological free fermionic models and structures
which appear in m(f)theory, hoping that it will eventually yield further
phenomenological insight.

the (51, 3) z2  z2 orbifold model is obtained by twisting a (t2)3 3
dimensional complex manifold parametrized by {z1, z2, z3}. the rst and
second z2 twists take

and

{z1, z2, z3}  {z1,z2, z3}

{z1, z2, z3}  {z1,z2,z3}.

calculating the cohomology of this manifold, yields (h11, h21) = (51, 3).
connecting this model to the (27, 3) can be done using the landau
ginzburg formalism with a freely acting twist [40] or by adding the freely
acting shift

{z1, z2, z3}  {z1 + 1/2, z2 + 1/2, z3 + 1/2},

which identies points by the shift on all three complex tori simultaneously.
under this shift the number of xed points from the twisted sectors is
reduced by half, hence producing the spectrum of the (27,3) model.

the next step is to implement this freely acting shift or twist in the f
theory compactication to six dimensions. the key here is that the models
should admit and elliptic bration with a global section, in which a calabi
yau 3fold is identied as a two complexdimensional base manifold b with
a ber. the compactication is then dened by specifying the toroidal ber
in the weierstrass form,

y2 = x3 + f (z1, z2)x + g(z1, z2),

where f and g are polynomials of degrees 8 and 12, respectively and are
functions of the base coordinates. the number of neutral hypermultiplets,
tensor multiplets and the rank of the vector multiplets are then given by:
h 0 = h21(x) + 1, t = h11(b)  1 and

r(v ) = h11(x)  h11(b)  1,

respectively, in terms of h11, h21 of the cy 3fold and the base. cancelation
of the gravitational anomaly in six dimensions requires that

h 0  v = 273  29t,

where v is the number of vector multiplets.

12

the weierstrass representation of ftheory compactication on the

(51,3) model is given by

where

and

y2 = x3 + f8(w, w)xz4 + g12(w, w)z6,

f8 =   3h2, and g12 = h(  2h2),

4

h = k

yi,j=1

(w  wi)( w  wj)

 = c

4

yi,j=1

(w  wi)2( w  wj)2.

taking w  wi (or w  wi) we have a d4 singular ber. thus, we
have an enhanced so(8)8 gauge symmetry, since i, j = 1, . . . , 4. these d4
singularities intersect in 16 points, (wi, wj), i, j = 1, . . . 4, in the base and
give rise to 16 additional tensor multiplets. with the equations given above
we see that this ts the data of ftheory compactication on the z2  z2
cy 3fold with (h11, h21) = (51, 3).

to nd the ftheory compactication on the corresponding (27, 3)
model we implement the freely acting twist in the elliptic bration. for
this purpose it is more convenient to represent the ber in quartic form,
which is given by

y2 = x4 + x2 z2 f4 + xz3g6 + z4h8,

with f4 = 3h, g6 = 0, and h8 = 1/4. the freely acting twist which
acts simultaneously on the base and the ber is given by

(y, x, z, w, w)  (y,x, z,w, w).

we now see that to implement this identication h and  are modied and
are given by

2

h = k

yi,j=1

(w2  w2

i )( w2  w2
j )

and

 = c

2

yi,j=1

(w2  w2

i )2( w2  w2

j )2.

we see that there are now only 4 d4 singularities, and similarly the num-
ber of intersecting singularities is reduced by 2. hence, in this ftheory
compactication the enhanced symmetry is so(8)4 with t = 9, h 0 = 4
and v = 112. this matches the data of the (27,3) model with h11(b) = 10.

13

however, we see that in this case the gravitational anomaly is apparently
not satised.

a plausible interpretation of the above result is that the (27,3) model
does not provide a consistent background for ftheory compactication
to six dimension. however, this will still be a strange situation because
the freely acting twist is a consistent operation which should not destroy
the bration. to study the issue further, we examine the eect of the
freely acting shift on the (t2)3 manifold. it is then seen that although the
shift is freely acting on the cy 3fold, it is not freely acting on the base
when the cy is regarded as a bration. hence, the base in the bered
cy has four singular points that are not singular points of the cy 3fold.
therefore, there are no h11 and h21 forms that can be used to resolve these
singularities. the elliptic bration and the global section are destroyed at
those singular points.

the existence of these special singular points is quite interesting. an-
other plausible interpretation for the resolution of the puzzles is that due
to these special singularities there exist additional massless states that can
only be seen nonperturbatively. furthermore, the appearance of the special
singularities is closely tied to the action of the freely acting shift on the
ber. to see that we implement another shift on the elliptically bered
(51,3) model, induced by the shift

(z1, z2, z3)  (z1 + 1/2, z2 + 1/2, z3).

this shift is not freely acting on the cy 3fold and there is an additional
sector yielding (h11, h21) = (31, 7). this shift is not freely acting on the base
but there are now four additional (h11, h21) pairs that can be used to resolve
the base singularities in the usual manner. for ftheory compactication
on the (31,7) cy 3fold: t = 13; h 0 = 8 and v = 112 and it is checked
that it is consistent with the gravitational anomaly.

the discussion above illustrates that the puzzles in the ftheory com-
pactication on the (27,3) model precisely arise because of the action of
the freely acting shift on the ber

z3  z3 + 1/2.

while one possible interpretation is that the (27,3) model does not provide
a consistent background for ftheory compactication, the situation is non
trivial and still unresolved. but we may contemplate that some new physics
is associated with the action of the shift on the ber, which in the case of
the type iib string theory is identied with the dilaton. all in all we
see that the free fermionic z2  z2 orbifold is special and perhaps more
surprises lie in store.

8. equivalence postulate of quantum mechanics 

embarking on a novel approach to quantum gravity

over the last few years important new insight has been gained on the fun-
damental structure of string theory. we now know that dierent theories,
that are classically distinct, are in fact related quantum mechanically by
various duality transformations. many of the duality relations have an in-
herent geometrical description. what is the lesson to be extracted from
this new understanding ? it seems to me that what is needed is a new
fundamental principle. this is the approach which is being pursued by
matone and myself. we have imposed the basic postulate that all physical
systems labelled by a potential function can be connected by a coordi-
nate transformation and showed that consistency of this postulate neces-
sitates the appearance of quantum mechanics and is intimately connected
to phasespace duality. the planck constant appears in this context as a
covariantizing parameter. we then have a fundamental geometrical princi-
ple behind quantum mechanics and h 6= 0. i will follow here the historical
path of this development.

working in seibergwitten theory [41] matone [42] noted that the
picardfuchs equation for the duals, a(u) and ad(u), can be inverted.
yielding u(a) = 1
2 aaf  f, which is an exact nonperturbative relation
and the prepotential function is given by ad = af . written in the form
u(a) = a2a2ff, it is noted that it has the form of the legendre transfor-
mation. this relation is not particular to seibergwitten theory and can
be applied to other theories which are described by a second order linear
dierential equation. we rst applied this idea to the schrodinger equation,
where we introduced a prepotential function dened by the relation

d = f ,

with  and d being the two linearly independent solutions of the
schrodinger equation [43]. one then obtains the inverted form

x() = 22f  f,

which oers the possibility of a coordinate free formulation of quantum
gravity. a direction which is being pursued primarily in ref. [44, 45].

the inversion relation is a general relation between dual variables re-
lated by a generating function. the natural step is to apply it to the phase
space coordinates related by hamiltons generating function p = qs0. one
then obtains the dual legendre transformations [46],

and

s0 = ppt0  t0

t0 = qqs0  s0

15

where t0(p) is a new generating function dened by q = pt0. two ob-
servations are important to note. the rst is that the legendre trans-
formation is undened for linear functions, i.e.
for s0 = a + bq. the
second is that similar to the case of seibergwitten theory, and the case
of the schrodinger equation, one can associate a second order dierential
equation with each legendre transformation, which we call the canonical
equation [46]. the potential function in the canonical equation for s0
is given by {q,s0}, where {,} denotes the schwarzian derivative. choosing
that the reduced action transforms as a scalar function under coordinate
transformations, it is noted that by construction the 2ndorder dieren-
tial equation is covariant. the schwarzian derivative, however, is invariant
under mobius transformations, but not under general coordinate trans-
formations. this fact suggests that dierent physical systems labelled by
dierent potentials can be connected by coordinate transformations. given
the new insight gained in the context of string dualities, and the discussion
above on legendre duality, it is natural to promote this new insight to the
level of a fundamental physical principle. in ref. [46] we posed the following
postulate:

given two physical systems with w a(qa)  h and w b(qb)  h, where
h denotes the space of all possible ws, there always exists a coordinate
transformation qa  qb = v(qa) such that w a(qa)  w av(qb) = w b(qb).
we note that this postulate also implies that there should always exist
a coordinate transformation connecting any state to the state w 0(q0) = 0.
inversely, this means that any state w  h can be reached from the state
w 0(q0) by a coordinate transformation.
a natural application of this postulate is in the context of the classi-
cal hamiltonjacobi formalism. there one solves the dynamical problem
by performing canonical transformations which map a dynamical system,
governed by a hamiltonian h, to a trivial dynamical system with vanish-
ing hamiltonian. the solution is given by the classical hamiltonjacobi
equation (chje), and the functional relation between p and q is only ex-
tracted after the hamiltonjacobi equation is solved. we aim to pose a
similar question, but with the novelty that we consider the transformation
q  q(q), while imposing the functional relation p = qs0, reducing to
the free system with vanishing energy. motivated from the legendre dual-
ity discussion we impose that under the transformation s0(q) = s0(q). it
follows that p transforms as q.

the cshje,

xes the transformation

1/2m(qs0)2 + w(q) = 0,

w(q)  w(q) = (qq)2w(q).

16

it is observed that the state w 0(q0) = 0 is a xed point under the co-
ordinate transformation. that is we cannot reach all possible states by
coordinate transformation from the state w 0(q0) = 0. consistency of the
equivalence postulate then implies that the cshje should be deformed.
the most general form would be,

1/2m(qs0)2 + w(q) + q(q) = 0,

where the nature of q(q) is to be determined by the consistency of the
equivalence postulate, which imposes that the combination (w + q) trans-
forms as a quadratic dierential. on the other hand all states should be
connected to the state w 0(q0) = 0 by a coordinate transformation. the
basic transformation properties are,

w v(qv) = (qv qa)2 w a(qa) + (qa; qv),
qv(qv) = (qv qa)2 qa(qa)  (qa; qv),

which xes the cocycle condition for the inhomogeneous term [46]

(qa; qc) = (cid:0)qc qb(cid:1)2

[(qa; qb)  (qc; qb)].

the importance of the cocycle condition is that it uniquely xes the trans-
formation properties of the inhomogeneous term, and hence xes its func-
it is then proven that the inhomogeneous term (qa; qb) is
tional form.
invariant under the mobius transformation, and is uniquely given by the
schwarzian derivative {qa, qb}. the cocycle condition is generalizable to
higher dimensions and xes that the inhomogeneous term is invariant un-
der the ddimensional mobius transformations [48]. the cocycle condition
univocally implies [46],

h2
4m{e(i2s0/h), q},
w(q) = v (q)  e = 
h2
4m{s0, q},

q(q)

=

where in demonstrating this we used the basic identity,

(qs0)2 = h2/2 ({exp(i2s0/h, q)}  {s0, q}) .

note that the qshje is a nonlinear thirdorder dierential equation. the
schrodinger equation in this context can be regarded as linearization of the
qhje [46], in the following sense. from eq. (1) and the mobius invariance
of the schwarzian derivative it is seen that the solution of the qhje is
given in terms of the ratio of the two real linearly independent solutions of
the stationary schrodinger equation, w = d/, by

e

(5)

where  = {, } with   r and re 6= 0, which is equivalent to the
condition s0 6= const. we note that the trivializing map to the w 0(q0) = 0
system is given by q  q0 = w.
several points are important to note. first is that also for the state
w 0 = 0 we have s0 6= const. therefore, s0 = const is not in the space
of solutions and we have that the equivalence postulate is consistent with
quantum mechanics but is inconsistent with classical mechanics. this fact
also allows for the denability of the legendre transformation for all phys-
ical states. thus we have that the denability of the legendre duality and
the consistency of the equivalence postulate are intimately related.

it is further shown [46] that consistency of the equivalence postulate
implies both energy quantization for bound states with a square integrable
wavefunction, as well as the tunnelling eect, without assuming the prob-
ability interpretation of the wavefunction. thus, we have that the main
characteristics of quantum mechanics arise from the selfconsistency of the
equivalence postulate. this is of fundamental importance as we see that
the main phenomenological features of quantum mechanics are reproduced
starting from the equivalence postulate without further assumptions.
i
refer the reader to the original papers [46] for details of this fascinating
avenue. here i focus on the characteristics of the formulation which are
related to the planck scale, and hence may be related to string theory.

there are two consequences of the formulation that are clearly related
to the planck scale and hence to gravity and possibly to string theory. the
rst is the appearance of a fundamental length scale which is identied with
the planck length and the second is the existence of equivalence classes of
the wavefunction which depend on this length scale [46].

first it is noted that the formulation provides a trajectory represen-
tation of quantum mechanics [47], which due to the mobius symmetry
depends on the constant . from the solution for the qhje we get
p = qs0 = p(q), which depends on the integration constants of the qshje.

pe = 

h(e + e)

2|k1 sin kq  ie cos kq|2 ,

18

(6)

where k = 2me/h. the existence of a fundamental length scale, iden-
tied with the planck length, can already be inferred from the basic leg-
endre duality and consistency of the equivalence postulate which require
that s0 6= 0. it is seen more explicitly by considering the consistency of the
classical limit, h  0. in this limit we have that for e  0 we should have
p0  0. this shows that re0  h with 1 <  < 1. thus, consistency
of these limits implies the identication re0  p 6= 0 [46].
the next important property of the formulation is the existence of
equivalence classes of the wavefunction. as the qhje is a thirdorder
dierential equation whereas the schrodinger equation is a second order
one, more initial conditions are needed to be specied in the case of the
qhje. it follows that the wave function remains invariant under suitable
transformations of  = {, }, corresponding to dierent trajectories. the
implication is that there are hidden variables which depend of the planck
length and that these can suitably change without aecting the wave
function. recently, thooft [49] has advocated that hidden variables must
play a role in the implementation of the holographic principle [50].

9. is there a connection with string theory ?

at the outset i would state that i do not know the answer to this question.
the aim is to try to nd some overlaps in the physical and mathematical
characteristics in the equivalence postulate derivation and in string theory.
nevertheless, it should be stressed that it is very natural to expect that
the correct theory of quantum gravity would arise from a principle such
as the equivalence postulate. already the appearance of the schwarzian
derivative in the framework of quantum mechanics should be regarded as
tantalizing evidence for a possible connection with string theory and hence
with quantum gravity. below i enumerate other possible relations.

1) quadratic dierential: in string theory elimination of the world
sheet conformal anomaly is necessary in order for the energymomentum
tensor to transform as a quadratic dierential and for obtaining dieomor-
phism invariance, i.e. einstein equations, in target space. thus, the fact
that the energymomentum tensor transforms as a quadratic dierential
plays an important role. similarly, the equivalence postulate derivation
imposes that the hamiltonian (hamiltonjacobi equation) transforms as a
quadratic dierential. the similarity is not complete because in the string
case we require that cancelation of a quantum anomaly restores a classi-
cal symmetry, whereas in the equivalence postulate derivation we required
that the quantum modication enables that the hj equation transforms as
a quadratic dierential. nevertheless, it seems that there should be a deep
reason why in both cases the quadratic dierential transformation plays a
crucial role. another caveat is that we have not yet included fermions in

19

the formalism. however, we may envision that the square of the fermionic
hamiltonian transforms as a quadratic dierential.

2) the existence of mobius symmetry represents an invariance under
nite dieomorphism. the sl(2, c) symmetry plays a central role in string
theory and a central role in the formulation of quantum mechanics from the
equivalence postulate. the mobius symmetry is the origin of the existence
of equivalence classes of the wavefunction and of a fundamental length
scale. the presence of a mobius symmetry should suggest a connection
with string theory. indeed, one may expect that performing innitesimal
dieomorphism would recover some of the features of 2d-cfts, including
the virasoro algebra, vector spaces, etc. in higher dimensions the symmetry
of the cocycle is the higher dimensional mobius group [48]. in that case,
we may envision that performing innitesimal dieomorphism should entail
some generalization of the virasoro algebra, possibly in the form of w
algebras ?

3) the hidden variables in the equivalence postulate formulation can be
identied with a fundamental length scale, most naturally with the planck
length [46]. furthermore, the equivalence classes of the wavefunction can
be parametrized in terms of this fundamental length scale. the emergence
of a fundamental length scale should give rise to the suspicion of a connec-
tion with quantum gravity and possibly with string theory. an intriguing
thought is that the emerging length scale and its role in the equivalence
classes of the wavefunction may somehow be related to the internal string
dimension. the analogy of the formalism with uniformization theory [46]
suggests that the hidden variables may be associated with riemann sur-
faces, further indicating possible connections with string theory.

10. does it address the vacuum energy problem ?

again i would state that i do not know the answer to that question. we
may however contemplate how the equivalence postulate may aect the
standard picture. surely, if the equivalence postulate is a fundamental law
of nature, as we may infer from the understandings gained in the context
of string dualities, then it will by default also shed light on this issue.

we see that in the quantum hj equation there is an additional term
which is identied with a quantum motion, or quantum potential, which is
nonzero also when the potential and the energy vanish

1
2m

(qs0)2 +

h2
4m{s0, q} = 0

(7)

the implication is that, unlike the classical case, s0 is never vanishing and
the state s0 = constant is excluded from the space of allowed solutions.

20

this is the fundamental characteristic of quantum mechanics in our ap-
proach. thus, we see that the state with v (q) = 0 and e = 0 is indeed
pointed out in the equivalence postulate approach. the solution for the
ground state in the quantum case is given by s0 = ih/2 ln q, up to mobius
transformations. consequently, the conjugate momentum for the ground
state is also nontrivial. being the characteristic property of quantum
mechanics, we can regard this as the quantum trajectory version of the
uncertainty principle. all in all, we see that the vacuum state is singled
out relative to its role in the classical case. furthermore, the quantum
ground solution is also the selfdual state of the legendre phasespace
transform and its dual. that is, it is the unique simultaneous solution
of the two second order linear dierential equations associated with each
legendre transformations [46]. thus, we have that the vanishing of the
vacuum state may be intimately related to the legendre phasespace du-
ality. this is already one hint that the equivalence postulate and legendre
phasespace duality may shed light on the vacuum energy issue.

the equivalence postulate point of view is that the fundamental equa-
tion is the qhje, which is a thirdorder nonlinear dierential equation. it
is equivalent to the schrodinger equation (in the sense discussed above eq.
(5)), but requires specifying more initial conditions than for the schrodinger
equation. we have that there is a moduli space of solutions of the qhje,
which corresponds to the same wave function. that is, there are hidden
variables which depend on the planck length and are not detected in the
solutions of the schrodinger equation. this means that the schrodinger
equation with its related apparatus provides an eective description, albeit
an extremely successful one from the experimental point of view. now,
the vacuum energy in conventional quantum mechanics is an artifact of the
hilbert space construction, i.e.
it is an artifact of the eective descrip-
tion. but from the point of view of the equivalence postulate the more
complete solution is given by the qhje, which admits a nontrivial solu-
tion also for the state with vanishing energy and vanishing potential. the
existence of such a specialized state already indicates that it may have
something to do with the vacuum energy, as according to the equivalence
postulate all other states are connected to this special state by coordinate
transformations. this leads to the existence of a fundamental length scale
with all the expected implications of modications of the uncertainty rela-
tions, and spacetime uncertainty relations, etc. however, the important
fact is the existence of the additional term in the quantum hj equation,
q(q) = (h/2m){s0, q}, which is never vanishing. this term can be in-
terpreted as a curvature term [46], which means that the existence of the
state itself is associated with a sort of quantum curvature. so it seems
articial to speak of particles and curvature as distinct entities. it seems,
that from the equivalence postulate point of view there is no meaning to
talk about vacuum energy. rather we should speak about the vacuum cur-

21

vature, associated with the existence of the particles themselves, which is
never vanishing, and is associated with the state for which the potential
and the energy vanish.

another observation on the equivalence postulate derivation is the way
in which mass appears in the formalism. in quantum eld theories, the vac-
uum energy problem is tightly related to the generation of mass through
symmetry breaking. in the equivalence postulate derivation, it is intriguing
to note that mass appears only after making the identication in eq. (1). in
the identity, eq. (3), which is related to the qhje eq. (4), the mass is only
a multiplicative constant, which can be dropped from the equation. this
feature also persists in the higher dimensional generalization [48]. thus,
we see that mass in the equivalence postulate derivation is an articial ef-
fect of representing the potential in the functional form w(q) = v (q)  e.
the fact that the schwarzian derivative is associated with a curvature term
suggests that mass in this formalism is related to intrinsic curvature asso-
ciated with a particle state. this property of the formalism is reminiscent
of the gravitational equivalence principle and is further evidence that the
equivalence postulate formalism provides a natural framework for quantum
gravity.

11. conclusions

should we believe in the relevance of string theory in nature ? the most
urgent issue in particle physics is the nature of the electroweak symmetry
breaking mechanism. the basic question is whether fundamental scalar
states exist in nature, or whether a more intricate, yet unperceived, mech-
anism plays a role. this question must and will be resolved by our exper-
imental colleagues, who have already provided us with a glorious conr-
mation of the standard model gauge and matter sectors. the standard
model multiplet structure strongly indicates the realization of grand unify-
ing structures in nature, and augmented with supersymmetry is the leading
candidate for a theory of electroweak symmetry breaking, to be tested by
future experiments. string theory provides the most advanced tools to
study quantum, gravity and gauge, unication. the fact that one nds
string models that closely resemble the real world, and exactly where ex-
pected, namely near a maximally symmetric point, leads to the intriguing
suspicion that string theory is indeed relevant in nature.

a plausible view of recent years deeper understandings in string theory
is that dierent theories that are classically distinct, are in fact connected
quantum mechanically. it is then natural to promote this new insight to
a level of a fundamental physical principle. from such a principle the

22

correct theory of quantum gravity should be derivable, as well as the phe-
nomenological characteristics of quantum eld theories, and the fundamen-
tal vexing problems, like the vanishing of the cosmological constant and the
problem of mass. at the closing of one millennium, it seems that the new
one may still oer plenty of surprises.
