in the large-n limit of d = 4, n = 4 gauge theory, the dual ads
space becomes at. we identify a gauge theory correlator whose large-
n limit is the at space s-matrix.

the maldacena dualities [1, 2] relate string theory in various near-horizon
geometries to gauge and other quantum eld theories. if correct, these give

nonperturbative denitions of string theory in these backgrounds. for ex-
ample, one could in principle simulate the quantum eld theory on a large

enough computer, which is the criterion originally set forth by wilson [3] for
a nonperturbative denition in the case of quantum eld theory. further, in
the large-n limit of each eld theory the curvature and eld strengths of the

dual geometry vanish, and so it should be possible to extract any property of
the at spacetime string theory. in this note we pursue this idea, addressing

the following question: what quantity in large-n gauge theory corresponds
to the at spacetime string s-matrix?

the description of the at-spacetime limit is highly nonuniversal and
noncovariant: by taking dierent quantum eld duals, dierent kinematics,

and dierent processes one obtains very dierent constructions of the s-
matrix. we present here only one such construction, from a limit of ads5 
s5. it is to be hoped that some universal and covariant description can be
extracted from the large-n limit, and the kinematics of the present paper
may be a useful step in this direction. other discussions of holomorphy and

at spacetime appear in [4].

there have been many recent discussions of scattering processes in ads

spacetime [5, 6, 7]. the present work certainly overlaps these, but we do not
know of work that directly addresses the question discussed here. inciden-
tally, there appear to be a belief (also nonuniversal) that the s-matrix cannot

be extracted from anti-de sitter space even in a limit; we do not understand
these arguments, but the explicit construction here may help to clarify the

issues.

we consider d = 4 n = 4 su(n) gauge theory on s3 with minkowski
time, which is dual to iib string theory on the whole of ads5  s5 [8]. one
could also consider the space r3, but the dual geometry is incomplete and
one would have to arrange the kinematics carefully to avoid losing outgoing

2

particles. the metric of ads5 is

ds2 = r2"(1 + r2)dt2 +

dr2
3#
1 + r2 + r2d2

= r2"(1 + r2)dt2 + dx  dx 

(x  dx)2

1 + r2 # ,

(1)

where r4 = 42gsn and r2 = x  x. points on the boundary s3 will
be labelled by unit four-vectors e. because the metric contains a factor of
r2, distances as measured by an inertial observer dier by a factor of r
from coordinate distances; we will always refer to the former as proper, and
similarly for momenta. we will always dimensionally reduce on the s5 factor,
producing an eective mass term in ads5.

consider rst the case of particles that are massless in ads5. the geodesic

motion

x = e tan t ,

pt =  , p =

e
1 + r2 ,

(2)

begins at the boundary point e at t = /2, reaches the origin at t =

0, and returns to the boundary point +e at t = +/2. a particle on a
second geodesic, reected by e  e, will intersect the rst at the origin. a

scattering process would have a proper center-of-mass energy-squared

s = gtt(2pt)2 = 42/r2 .

(3)

if the particles scatter into n massless outgoing particles, the latter will still
reach the boundary at t = +/2 but at general points of the asymptotic s3.
thus it is possible to probe the general massless scattering with sources on
the boundary at t = /2 and detectors on the boundary at t = +/2. by

holding the external proper momenta of the process xed as r  , one
obtains the at spacetime scattering amplitude. this corresponds to holding

the detector angles xed while, by eq. (3),   r. in terms of the underlying
string parameters, we wish to obtain the 10-dimensional theory with given
gs. this corresponds to n   with gs xed. in summary,

we now use this reasoning to give an lsz-like prescription for the mass-
less particle s-matrix. we will assume initially that the particles propagate

freely except for their interaction near the origin, and then discuss correc-
tions. there is one annoying complication. thus far we have described

the scattering classically, specifying both the positions and momenta of the
external particles. for ordinary at spacetime scattering one can put the
external particles in momentum eigenstates, because the scattering location

is irrelevant. in the present case, in order to obtain denite kinematics in
the at limit, the scattering must occur in a known position due to the

position-dependence of the metric. thus we must resort to wavepackets.

since  is large in the limit of interest a wkb approximation can be

used. for simplicity we consider scalar particles. the details are given in
the appendix; we present here the results. there is a solution e to the free
wave equation, which follows the classical trajectory (2) with an uncertainty
1/2 in x. to be precise, in the neighborhood of the origin

e(t, x)  fe(t, x)ei(tex) ,

(5)

with fe(t, x) a smooth envelope of width 1/2 centered on the trajectory
x = et. the coordinate width 1/2 goes to zero at large n, so the width of
the packet is small compared to the ads radius, while the proper width r

goes to innity. the overlap region of the packets is well-localized compared
to the ads scale, as desired, while the uncertainty in the proper momentum
is r11/2 and goes to zero. thus the scattering of the packets approaches
the at space process. at r  ,

e(t, x)  hg(t + /2, |x + e|) + g+(t  /2, |x  e|)ieit .

(6)

the two terms represent the beginning and ending of the trajectory on the
boundary. the functions g are of width 1/2 in both time and angle,
and as discussed in the appendix are related in a simple way to fe(t, x).
incidentally, the solution e has no reected piece at t > /2 or t < /2.

consider now the current

je = e  e  .

(7)

here the hat denotes the eld operator in the eective bulk quantum eld
theory. continuing to ignore interactions away from the origin, this current

is conserved. dene then

e = zs

da nje .

(8)

due to current conservation, we can take for an incoming particle either of
the surfaces s1 and s2 shown in gure 1, each of which intersects the packet
before the scattering region. for an outgoing particle there are corresponding
surfaces after the scattering. the spacelike surface s1 is taken to lie in the at
region near the origin as n  . the integral (8) then denes a at-space
creation operator for an incoming particle; with the envelope function fe
omitted this would give a covariantly normalized plane wave. for the timelike
region s2 at the boundary we can use the dictionary [5, 6]

r4 (t, x) = o(t, x) ,

lim
r

(9)

where o is the corresponding operator1 in the gauge theory on s3. we
dene  to have canonical normalization as a ve-dimensional eld, so that
the relation (9) denes an implicit normalization for o.

the integral on s2 can therefore be expressed as an operator in the gauge
theory. the analysis can immediately be extended to particles with masses
of order the kaluzaklein scale r1 (which are therefore massless in ten
dimensions).2 classically these do not reach the boundary but do come very
close, reaching r  . they can still be created by  at the boundary but

1we continue to ignore interactions, but in fact we believe that the relation (9) will

hold at least perturbatively in the interacting theory [9].

2 s-matrices for particles with nonzero ten-dimensional masses cannot be studied in

this way; note, however, that the iib string theory has no bps particle states.

(10)

while the factor of r4 in the operator relation (9) becomes r2+. the integral
on s2, and the corresponding integral for outgoing particles, are then

e = 2z dt d3x g(t + /2, |x + e|)eit o(t, x)
e+ = 2z dt d3x g+(t  /2, |x  e|)eit o(t, x) .

(11)

these express the bulk creation and annihilation operators in terms of the
operators in the boundary gauge theory. incidentally, the solution e is non-

6

normalizable, while the wave operator  couples to the normalizable modes
that appear in the quantization of the eld in ads space. for any mass the
product of these behaves as r4 at large r; combined with r1 from r, r from
nr, and r4 from the metric, the integrals dening e are r-independent.

the at-space s-matrix is then

s(i, o) = lim

(12)

here i and o denote the sets of incoming and outgoing particles, the proper

energy of each particle is /r and the proper momentum is e/r. the
expectation value is in the gauge theory on s3, with the operators (11). the
factor  accounts for the overlap of wavepackets,

 = z dt d4x zs 5

d5x yii o

fiei(t, x)i(x) .

(13)

here i(x) is the normalized wavefunction on s5; for an so(6) singlet the net
contribution of the compact space is (vs 5)(2n)/2. the proper momenta in the
s5 direction are of order 1/r and so vanish in the limit: the scattering process
is restricted to a ve-dimensional plane. to study processes with nonzero
momenta in the s5 directions would require the use of high representations
of so(6), scaling with n.

consider now corrections to free propagation, as depicted in gure 2. of
course, these same processes are present in at space, so they will change
the s-matrix formula only to the extent that interactions at distances of or-

der the horizon size are important. the characteristic size of the scattering
region is set by the external momenta and so scales as 1. thus, the in-
teraction corrections will only be dangerous if they are ir divergent. in ve
dimensions even with massless particles amplitudes at generic momenta are
ir convergent.3 this is a at-spacetime result but in general one expects that

3in lower dimensions one should in any case be considering not the s-matrix but an

appropriate ir-nite inclusive amplitude.

interactions (dashed lines) correcting the free propagation of

ir diverenges are exacerbated by positive curvature and reduced by negative
curvature [10]. this appears to be the case here as well, for example from

examination of the gauge boson propagator in ref. [11].

ref. [6] discusses various more subtle ways in which the relation (9) may

fail due to interactions. however, we believe that our result for the s-matrix
is robust. a local perturbation in the gauge theory is expected to correspond
to a local disturbance on the boundary of ads space; this is fully consistent

with interactions in the euclidean case [2], for example. this disturbance
will propagate into the interior of ads space as a particle or multiparticle

8

state; appropriate kinematics then produces the s-matrix. we have used local
elds (9) to derive the lsz formula and of course the theory in the bulk is not

a local eld theory. however, we have used the eld relation only in a very
weak sense, essentially its vacuum to one-particle matrix element  there is

no assumption that eld theory, or locality, holds in the interaction region. in
particular, we see no obstacle to assuming that the lsz expression holds for
arbitrarily large proper energies, of order the string scale, the planck scale,

or beyond. note however that the proper energy is held xed as n  .

it would be interesting to subject the s-matrix result (12) to various tests.

however, many of its required properties, such as so(9, 1) invariance, will
not be manifest but instead must be taken as predictions for the behavior of

the gauge theory. it may be possible to analyze the pole structure using the
ope in the gauge theory.

the nal expression (12) in the gauge theory involves three energy
momentum scales: order 1 (in coordinate units) from the separation of the
sources and the curvature of s3, order   n 1/4 from the incoming and
outgoing waves, and order 1/2 from the envelope function. one could also
include a simpler object, in which the envelope functions are omitted and

so one integrates the sources and detectors over times and angles (perhaps
with spherical harmonics). this still gives the at spacetime s-matrix but

now with some average over external momenta because the kinematics of the
scattering depends on its location, and also with the possible complication of
multiple scattering from the periodicity of motion in ads spacetime. thus,

at-spacetime physics is obtained in the large-n limit of a two-scale object,
with momenta of order 1 and of order gsn 1/4. further, the large momenta
appear only in the time direction of the gauge theory.
incidentally, there
seems to be no simple distanceenergy relation such as there is in one-scale

processes [1, 12].

appendix

to analyze wavepackets with e = (1, 0, 0, 0) it is convenient to use coordinates
(, y) with y a three-vector, as dened by

x = (tan , y/ cos ) .

the classical trajectory of interest is simply

 = t , y = 0 .

in these coordinates the metric is

we seek a solution of the form

(a.5)

we are interested in the case   1 and so make an analysis of geometric
optics (wkb) type. the rst term in the exponent is the rapidly varying

phase. the second and third terms produce the envelope in space and time;
it follows that y and t   are of order 1/2.

expanding 2 = 0 in powers of , the term of order 2 is

in the regime   r  1 both the large-r and wkb expressions are valid
