(2.1) radii compact dimensions satisfy relations ra 2 ri q/2, open string state really tachyonic zero-mode na = wi = 0. clearly, instability cured adjusting value moduli simple toroidal compactication, order stabilize non-bps branes z2-projection plays crucial role. let us rst recall generalities = 6 n = 2 bulk theory. untwisted closed string sector, modding i4 kills half original physical degrees freedom. one left gravitational multiplet either 4 vector multiplets n = (1, 1) supersymmetry type iia theory 5 tensor multiplet n = (2, 0) supersymmetry type iib theory. 16 orbifold xed-planes, also twisted sectors, strings close i4 identication. turns that, case, 2for detailed analysis perturbative d-brane spectrum theory see {$9803194$}. 2 one recovers supersymmetric spectrum using, also twisted sector, natural gso projection keeping even states i4 {$9803194$}. orbifold xed-points, one gets vector multiplet type iia case tensor multiplet type iib case. order discuss low-energy world-volume theory previously introduced non-bps brane, one dene z2 action open string states living it, particular c-p wave-function. correct procedure impose conservation quantum numbers respect i4 interactions among open closed strings. 1l sector, natural choice taking open string vacuum even state i4 turns consistent. conversely, 1 sector, one forced take opposite choice. see this, sucient look two-point amplitude untwisted r-r state open string tachyon. well- known coupling  non-bps brane untwisted forms arising tachyon constant r dt c (p). momentum space gives vertex form k0 c 1...pp+1...p+n; since c (like brane emitting it) odd number lorentz indices compact space, odd i4 thus also tachyon eld so. means tachyonic zero mode projected non-bps brane stable one considers range radii specied eq. (2.1). thus, one resume projection rules open string sectors saying z2 operation acts also c-p factor adding minus sign states 1 sector. closed string point view non-bps brane described boundary state containing untwisted part ns-ns sector twisted part r-r sector . since boundary state encodes couplings brane states closed string spectrum (see e.g. {$9803194$}), conclude eective action contain dbi part, describing couplings ns-ns untwisted states, wz part, encoding interactions twisted r-r states. usual, orbifold projection change couplings among elds untwisted sector, thus one read part action result obtained type ii theory {$9803194$} simply setting zero elds odd i4. contrary wz part, involving twisted elds, explicitly calculated and, shall see next section, result contains couplings lower (twisted) forms related inow anomaly. may seem strange, since non-bps branes contain twice many fermions usual d- branes usually type ii theories two sets come opposite chirality. however, analyzing carefully eect z2 projection ramond sector, one sees chiral open string spectrum may emerge. consider rst spacetime lling case p = 5. case, ten-dimensional lorentz group so(9, 1) broken so(5, 1)so(4). 1l sector, standard gso-projection 3 4 -even states 1l sector 0 leads n = 2 gauge multiplet. bosonic sector, contains one gauge boson (6, 1) 4 scalar elds (1, 4), corresponding dimensional reduction gauge boson = 10. fermionic sector, spinors (4, 2) (4, 2), corresponding dimensional reduction chiral majorana-weyl spinor 16 = 10. 1 sector, non-standard gso-projection leads instead bosonic tachyon spinors (4, 2) (4, 2), corresponding dimensional reduction anti-chiral majorana-weyl spinor 16 = 10. finally, one keep z2- invariant states; since projection also depends c-p factor, means 4 -odd states 1 sector, 0 one keep 0 4 orbital contribution z2 orbifold operator (without c-p contribution). already discussed, tachyon odd global i4, therefore projected out. moreover, 4 so(4) construction odd 0 4 , using decomposition 4 = 2 2, one concludes 2 chosen even 0 4 , 2 odd. surviving spectrum therefore found consist gauge boson (6, 1) (1l sector) spinors (4, 2) (1l sector) (4, 2) (1 sector). order check projection correct also r open string sector, sucient consider 3-point amplitude tachyon two massless fermions, rst 1l sector second 1 sector. amplitude proportional tr(2 1/2|0i, vanish rst spinor (4, 2) second (4, 2), product representations contains ten-dimensional scalar. shows two spinors opposite eigenvalue i4 one keep orbifolded theory. non-supersymmetric world-volume theory therefore chiral. 1) h0| 1/2 eikx 1 cases p < 5, six-dimensional lorentz group so(5, 1) broken so(p, 1)so(5p). world-volume theory obtained simple dimensional reduction world-volume theory p = 5 case 6 p + 1 dimensions. 3. anomalies seen previous section resulting world-volume theory potentially chiral. precisely, theory strictly chiral spacetime lling case p = 5 (non-bps 6,8-brane wrapped 1,3 directions). cases p = 3 p = 1, world- volume theory obtained dimensional reduction correspondingly non-chiral, since fermions decompose two sets opposite chiralities. however, due fact original fermions chiral, two sets spinors transform fermionic representations opposite chiralities also respect group transverse rotations so(5 p), chiral asymmetry generated normal bundle brane (in non-compact spacetime) non-trivial. 4 therefore, happens bps case, also non-bps branes anomalous world-volume theory, despite fact string theory construction perfectly well- dened. nothing particular case well known fact topological defect consistent quantum eld theory leads apparent (local) violation charge conservation supports fermionic zero modes {$9805170$}. obviously, starting theory consistent, nal result, actually happens topological defect develops suitable anomalous couplings bulk elds, leading inow charge bulk. words, world-volume one-loop anomaly exactly canceled tree-level anomaly, charge conservation restored {$9805170$}. occurrence r-r anomalous couplings bps topological defects like d-branes o-planes string theory vacua well established. couplings com- pletely determined requirement inow anomaly associated corresponding magnetic interactions cancel possible world-volume anomalies  (see also {$9805170$}). also determined direct string theory computations . since also non-bps branes potentially support anomalies, natural expect also develop anomalous couplings, indeed show so. shall follow approach {$9805170$}, extract r-r anomalous factorization string theory computation anomaly inow. one-loop partition function non-bps d-brane given projected annulus vacuum amplitude z(t) = 1 4 trrn  , (3.1) h open-string hamiltonian trace contains sum two c-p sectors 1l 1. generating functional one-loop correlation functions photons gravitons non-bps d-brane obtained integrating correct measure modular parameter annulus partition function, evaluated 0 dt (t) z(t). clearly, possible anomalies emerge cp-odd part eective action, associated odd spin-structure, happen boundary terms moduli space. gauge gravitational background: = r {$9805170$}, general method compute directly anomalous part eective action explicit string computation presented. gauge variation repre- sented insertion unphysical vertex amplitude, representing photon graviton pure-gauge polarization. formal manipulations, unphysical vertex combines world-sheet supercurrent appearing odd spin-structure amplitudes, leave t-derivative correlation certain eective vertex operator generic gauge gravitational background. interestingly, eect operator recog- nized correspond obtaining anomaly wess-zumino descent, = 2ir (1), 5 anomaly polynomial given background-twisted partition function. use standard descent notation: given gauge-invariant polynomial gauge gravitational curvatures f r, one denes (0) = di (0) (1) gauge variation (0) = di (1). consistent string vacua, uv boundary 0 potentially lead anoma- lies, turns vanishes itself. low-energy, interpreted green-schwarz mechanism, quantum one-loop anomaly cancelled equal opposite classical tree-level inow. suggested {$9805170$} interpretation recovered taking limit slowly varying background elds, corresponding low momenta external particles anomalous graph. limit, partition function becomes topological index independent modulus t, one ends extremely simple recipe polynomial anomaly inow descend (a (d+2)-form dimensions) given simply partition function, bosonic zero modes excluded convention working two dimensions higher. case, anomaly polynomial given = 1 4 trr  , (3.2) understood one keep (d+2)-form com- ponent, = p case. recall i4 (1)f act opposite signs two c-p sectors 1l 1. (1)f part gives vanishing contribution, due cancellation two c-p sectors four fermionic zero modes compact directions, twisted background. i4(1)f gives instead non-vanishing result, since fermionic zero modes absent two c-p sectors give exactly result, generating factor 2. rest, computation partition function proceeds exactly . internal part contributes3 factor 4: n neumann bosons give factor 2n cancels xed points degeneracy 2n, whereas four fermions contributes 2. setting 42 = 1, one nds nally i(f, r, r) = 2 ch(f ) ch(f ) ba(r) ba(r) e(r) .
