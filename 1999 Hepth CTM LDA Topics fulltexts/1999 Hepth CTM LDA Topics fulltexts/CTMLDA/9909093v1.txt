abstract we review some aspects of polyakovs proposal for constructing non-
supersymmetric eld theories from non-critical type 0 string theory.

getting some insight into nonsupersymmetric eld theory via ads/cft

approach is a dicult task to achieve. there are dierent proposals to
address this issue, dealing with possible mechanisms to break supersym-
metry. polyakov in [1] has proposed considering a nonsupersymmetric
string theory with non-chiral gso projection, known as type 0 [2, 3].
this proposal was elaborated further in a series of papers starting from
[4]. in this short note we present the results obtained in [5, 6].

type 0 string theories are purely bosonic strings with modular invari-
ant partition function and four sectors whose low laying elds are here

as pointed out in [1] there are no open string tachyons on the world-
volume of these branes, while there is a perturbative closed string tachyon
that renders the minkowski vacuum unstable. nevertheless one should
regard this as an indication that ten dimensional at background is not
stable, while there should exist other vacua in which the theory makes
sense. ads space seems in this respect a good candidate in that it allows
for tachyonic modes.

n = (1, 1) supersymmetry on the world-sheet makes these theories
similar in some respect to supersymmetric type ii. for example all tree
level correlators of vertex operators of (ns+,ns+) and (r+,r+) elds
are the same as type ii. using these and other properties it is possible
to derive an expression for the eective gravity action [4] that, split in
the nsns and rr contributions, reads:

snsns = z d10x g(cid:26)e2(cid:18)r

2|dt|2  v (t )(cid:19)(cid:27)

srr = z d10x gnf (t )|fp+2|2 +  + (cs terms)o .

the main novelties are coming from the tachyon couplings. in particular,
there is a potential v (t ) which is an even function of the tachyon eld,
as well as functions f (t ) multiplying rr terms, that can be worked out
perturbatively.

the original proposal in [1] was to consider a string theory in dimen-
sion d < 10. even if a microscopic description of string theory out of
criticality is still far, there are at least indications for a possible extension
of type 0 theories in non-critical dimensions:

a diagonal partition function, whose modular invariance doesnt
rely on d = 10 (as opposed to type ii theories)

the tachyon should condense, providing an eective central charge
ce  v (hti). it doesnt seem unnatural to shift ce by the central
charge decit (10  d)

ce provides a tree level cosmological constant in the low energy theory,
and this agrees with the expectation that the inconsistencies possibly
arise only in at background.

we work at the level of the eective gravity action. in d < 10 one
should guess the eld content of the theory and write down the relative
action.
in [5] we assume the nsns sector (gravity + tachyon) is al-
ways present and the rr sector is worked out on group theory grounds,
considering tensor products of so(d 2) spinors. in ve dimensions for

instance, 22 = 1+3, and one is led to include a scalar potential a and
a vector a. we further assume the existence of a 4-form potential to
accommodate the would be d3-brane: this really amounts to consider
massive gravity.

with these assumptions, the equations of motion following from the
relative action have interesting solutions, whose interpretation may give
some insight into their eld theory duals, and eventually provide hints
in favor of the consistency of either critical or even non-critical type 0
string theory.

the relevant piece of the d-dimensional action, for the ansatz that we

consider is 2

with such an ansatz the equations of motion become a set of algebraic
equations. the tachyon vev is determined implicitly by the following
equation

now, without a precise knowledge of the functions f (t ) and v (t ) one
cannot infer whether or not it admits solutions. one should really as-
sume it has, and extract some information.

the remaining equations x the value of the radii of the two maximally
symmetric spaces and that of the dilaton. it turns out that such solution
is a adsp+2  sdp2 space, with tachyon vev, and xed t hooft
coupling  = e0n .3

from p + 3 to d respectively.

notice that string loop corrections are suppressed in the large n limit,

while -corrections are important because the curvature is o(1).

by the ads/cft correspondence the eld theory dual of this solution
should be at a conformal point. however it is dicult to make contact
with perturbative eld theory because   o(1). nevertheless one can
still get additional information applying the correspondence. it is in fact
possible to count the number of degrees of freedom that should live in
the theory dual to this background [6].

consider a thermal deformation of the solution. identifying the hawk-
ing temperature with the nite temperature of the eld theory one can
compute the entropy. by either computing the free energy from the eu-
clidean action, or computing the area of the horizon, it turns out that
it has the following behavior

s  n 2vpt p

for any value of p. this is an indication that the dual eld theory
should have n 2 degrees of freedom, and could be ym theory in some
non gaussian limit. notice the dierent scaling power in the analogous
relation one gets from evaluating the entropies of black m2 and m5
branes (3/2 and 3 respectively).

we conclude pointing out that this kind of approach is potentially
predictive. consider in fact the formula for scaling dimensions of dual
operators4

first, note that the tachyon vev t0 behaves as a bare quantity:
it does not enter in determining physical quantities. it is very much as
in the renormalization group. one can do a eld redenition, this will
shift t0, without aecting , r0, .

then, the scaling dimensions depend on a nite number of parameters
and with a good guess on the eld theory side, one in principle should

be able to predict an innite tower of dimensions from kk analysis.
moreover, some control on the theory at this conformal point may shed
light on type 0 string theory and/or on non-critical string theory via
ads/cft correspondence.
