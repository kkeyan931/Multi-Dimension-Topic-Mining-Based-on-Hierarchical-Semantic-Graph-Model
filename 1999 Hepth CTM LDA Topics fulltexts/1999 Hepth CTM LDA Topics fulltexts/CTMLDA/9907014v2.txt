abstract

we show that there exist nite energy, non-singular instanton solutions for ve-
dimensional theories with broken gauge symmetry. the soliton is supported against
collapse by a non-zero electric charge. the low-energy dynamics of these solutions is
described by motion on the adhm moduli space with potential.

introduction

instantons appear as bps particle-like congurations in ve-dimensional supersym-
metric yang-mills theories. if the gauge symmetry is broken however, the instanton
shrinks to zero size resulting in a singular solution. in this letter, we show that when
the gauge group is broken to the maximal torus this collapse may be stabilised by a
non-zero electric charge.

we consider n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills in ve dimensions1 with arbitrary
gauge group g of rank r. the eld content consists of a vector eld with eld strength
f , a single real adjoint scalar , and two pseudo-majorana spinors. in ve dimensions
the gauge coupling constant g has dimension 1/2 and the theory is weakly coupled
in the infra-red. it is also non-renormalisable and is to be considered as an eective
theory for some, undetermined, short-distance physics.

the classical moduli space of the theory is rr/w , where w is the weyl group,
and is parametrised by the vacuum expectation value (vev) of  which is taken to
lie in the cartan sub-algebra: hi = v  h. we choose v such that g is broken to
u(1)r. as well as these surviving, local, abelian symmetries, the theory contains a
su(2)r  u(1)i global symmetry. the former is the usual r-symmetry for theories
with eight supercharges, while the latter has conserved current j = tr(f  f ) and
conserved charge equal to the instanton winding number, k. the supersymmetry
algebra includes a single, real, scalar central charge that includes contributions from
each local and global abelian symmetry [1],

z =

82k
g2 + v  q ,

(1)

where the r-vector q denotes electric charge under u(1)r. it was further shown in [1]
that the central charge is altered by the presence of chern-simons terms which may
be generated at one-loop. in this paper we shall restrict ourselves to actions without
such terms.

in the remainder of the paper, we shall demonstrate the existence of classical
soliton solutions charged under both u(1)i and local gauge symmetries. these con-
gurations therefore carry both topological and electrical charge and we christen
them dyonic instantons in analogy with four-dimensional monopoles. in the simplest
case of a single instanton in su(2) gauge group, the equations may be solved ex-
plicitly. for higher instanton charge in su(n) gauge group, we derive an expression
for the electric charge in terms of the adhm construction [2]. we further describe
the low-energy dynamics of instantons in spontaneously broken gauge groups by a
0+1 dimensional sigma-model on the adhm moduli space with a potential given by

1the n = 1 theory has eight supercharges. the arguments also apply to the n = 2 theories
with sixteen supercharges providing four of the scalar elds are set to zero. in these theories, the
dyonic instantons are 1/4-bps states.

the length of a tri-holomorphic killing vector. the dyonic instantons appear as bps
solutions to the equations of motion of this massive sigma-model.

the bogomolnyi equations

the existence of dyonic instantons may be demonstrated by a simple bogomolnyi
type argument, entirely analogous to that used for 1/4-bps states of the four-
dimensional n = 4 yang-mills theory [3]. one starts with the energy density for
the bosonic elds,

h = 1

2tr z d4x ne 2

 + 1

2f 2

 + (d0)2 + (d)2o ,

where  = 1, 2, 3, 4 is a spatial index, and e = 0a  da0. completing the square
in the usual fashion, we nd,

h = 1

2 trz d4xn(e  d)2 + 1

4 (f  f)2 + (d0)2 + 1

2 f

f + 2edo .

the nal two terms are both total derivatives, an observation that requires use of
gauss law,

de = ig[, d0] .

if the electric eld has the usual ve-dimensional leading order behaviour for a point-
like, electrically charged, conguration,

e =

q  h
22x4 x + . . . ,

where . . . denotes terms suppressed by 1/x, then the resulting energy bound coincides
with that derived using the supersymmetry algebra, h  |z|. the inequality is
saturated by time-independent solutions (0 = 0) with the time-component of the
gauge eld given by a0 =  and the remaining gauge elds determined by the usual
self-duality condition,

f = f .

(2)

finally, gauss law requires the adjoint scalar to obey the covariant laplace equation
in the background of the instanton,

d2 = 0 .

(3)

given a self-dual eld strength, there exists a unique solution to (3) for each vev of
, a result which can be seen through study of the instanton zero-modes [3]. in the

2

simplest case of a single instanton in su(2) gauge group, solutions to both (2) and
(3) are well known. in singular gauge they are given by,

a =

g

x2(x2 + 2)

a

(4)

where a are the self-dual t hooft matrices, a the pauli matrices in the role of
su(2) gauge generators, and  a collective coordinate determining the scale size of
the instanton. the ve-dimensional eld strength is therefore,

e = d =

2v2x
(x2 + 2)2 3

a

.

notice that in this gauge, the leading order term does not lie fully in the cartan sub-
algebra. the electric charge is given by the gauge invariant integral over the spatial
boundary,

q = z d4s

1
v

tr(e) = 422v ,

(5)

and a dyonic instanton of given electric charge q is therefore seen to stabilise at size
  (q/v)1/2.

in order to demonstrate the bps nature of these solutions, we consider the su-
persymmetry transformations of a ve-dimensional n = 1 gauge theory. these are
obtained from the dimensional reduction of the six-dimensional, chiral, (1, 0) su-
persymmetric gauge theory. in this way we nd that, for a bosonic conguration,
supersymmetry is preserved if and only if

f

(e0  d5) = 0 ,

(6)

where 0, 1, 2, ..., 5 are an eight dimensional representation of the cliord algebra
in six dimensions. the vanishing of these two terms therefore requires 1234 = 
and 05 = . since the six-dimensional theory is chiral (i.e. 012345 = ) the
second condition follows from the rst and one half of the n = 1 supersymmetries
are thus preserved. note that if we instead considered the maximal n = 2 theory,
obtained by dimensional reduction of the non-chiral, six-dimensional (1, 1) gauge
theory, then these two conditions are independent and the solution preserves one
quarter of the supersymmetry. this mirrors the situation for string-web type states
in four-dimensions; they too preserve four supercharges, regardless of the number of
supersymmetries of their parent theory.

the adhm construction

for higher instanton winding number, explicit solutions are not known. for classical
gauge groups however, a formal expression for solutions to (2) may be derived using

3

the adhm construction [2]. in recent years, this technique has been employed ex-
tensively by dorey, khoze, mattis and collaborators in order to calculate instanton
contributions to correlation functions in four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge the-
ories. see for example [4, 5, 6]. moreover, these authors have succeeded in casting
solutions to equation (3) in the language of the adhm variables. we now briey
review these solutions for instantons of winding number k in su(n) gauge groups
and determine an expression for the electric charge of the dyonic instanton in terms
of its collective coordinates.

a detailed discussion of the adhm construction for su(n) gauge group, as well
as its application to solving further equations, may be found in [6]. the construction
starts with a complex n + 2k  2k matrix . this matrix is linear in the spatial
coordinates x and, in a certain basis, has components,

 =  

a

i
i + x

aj

i ! ,

j

where the ranges of the indices are a = 1, . . . , n, i, j = 1, . . . , k, and ,  = 1, 2.
the 2  2 matrix x encodes the spatial coordinates in the usual quaternionic form,
x = x, with  = (1, a). the n  2k matrix  and the 2k-dimensional square
matrix a are both independent of x.

the next step is to dene a matrix of orthonormal null vectors of . this
n + 2k  n dimensional complex matrix u satises u = u  = 0. the adhm
ansatz for the gauge potential is then a = u u and is seen to yield a self-dual
eld strength provided the adhm constraints  = f 1  0 are satised, with f
a real, arbitrary, invertible k  k matrix. this construction can be shown to realise
the full 4kn dimensional hyperkahler moduli space of instantons.

in order to exhibit solutions to (3) in this language, we rst introduce a basis

for the cartan sub-algebra in which hi = diag (v1, . . . , vn ) with pa va = 0. then

solutions to the adjoint higgs equation of motion involves the n + 2k  n + 2k real,
constant matrix a and is given by [4, 6],

equation

2 tr2(cid:16)[a, a]a  a[a, a](cid:17) = tr2 hi ,

where tr2 denotes the trace over the ,  = 1, 2 indices of  and a. the expression
for the electric eld is now easily determined [4],

e = d = u ()f au  u af ()u .

where there is no summation over the a index on the right-hand side.

low-energy dynamics

the expressions (5) and (7) that we have derived for the electric charge are not
quantised. this of course is to be expected for noether charges in a classical theory.
in order to see how its quantisation arises, we examine the low-energy dynamics of the
soliton system. again, the situation here is entirely analogous to the corresponding
problem for 1/4-bps states [7].

we rst consider the low-energy dynamics of instantons in the case of vanish-
ing vev, for which the full adhm moduli space of solitons exists. let this space
be parametrised by coordinates x p, (for example, p = 1, . . . , 4kn for gauge group
su(n)), with the corresponding instanton zero mode denoted as pa. these zero
modes are subject to gauss law and must satisfy dpa = 0. the small-velocity
interactions of instantons are described in the usual manton approximation by a 0+1
dimensional sigma-model on this space with metric,

gpq = trz d4x {pa qa} .

(8)

this metric is singular at the points of vanishing instanton size. turning now to the
situation with non-zero vev, it is natural to describe the low-energy dynamics in
terms of the same sigma-model, extended to include a potential term [7],

v = 1

2trz d4x (d)2 = 1

2 v  q .

(9)

this potential has a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of the adhm moduli
space metric: it is equal to half the norm squared of a tri-holomorphic killing vec-
tor generated by the gauge transformation that asymptotes to v  h [8]. moreover,
denoting as   kp the components of the killing vector on the adhm moduli space
that is generated by the gauge transformation that asymptotes to   h, it was further
shown in [8] that the electric charge is given by,

q = gpq(v  kp) kq .

(10)

to see how this works in practice, we may return to the simplest example of the
single instanton in su(2). in this case it is known that the instanton moduli space is

5

c2c2/z2, where the rst factor parametrises the centre of mass of the instanton, the
radial coordinate of the second factor parametrises the scale size of the instanton, and
the angular coordinates parametrise the three gauge orientation modes. we choose
to write the at metric on c2/z2 as the singular limit of the eguchi-hanson metric,

ds2 = h(r)dr  dr + h 1(d +   dr)2 ,

where h = 2/r and    = h. furthermore,  has range 0   < 4 and
r = 22, where the coecient 2 has been determined in order to derive the correct
numerical value for the potential below. the singularity of the metric at r = 0 reects
the singularity of the corresponding instanton solution (4) at  = 0. an advantage of
the above description of c2/z2 is that the tri-holomorphic killing vector that arises
from u(1) gauge transformations (with period 2) is manifest and is given by 2.
the potential (9) becomes,

v = 4v2g = 4v2h 1 = 22v22 ,

(11)

whose functional form is in agreement with (5) and (9). notice that, unlike the similar
potential on taub-nut space that appears in the low-energy eective dynamics of
1/4-bps states [8, 7], the instanton potential (11) is unbounded.

so far, we have only described the low-energy dynamics of instantons embedded in
broken gauge groups. we have yet to recover a description of the dyonic instantons.
in fact, these appear as solutions to the equations of motion of the massive sigma
model [7, 9]. indeed, one may easily verify that solutions to the rst order equation,

dx p
dt

= v  kp ,

(12)

also satisfy the equations of motion. compactness of the gauge group ensures that
the orbits of these solutions are compact and they therefore have the interpretation
of excited instanton states rather than scattering states. they have mass given by
h = v  q and are identied with the dyonic instantons.

let us now consider the fermions in our discussion. their properties follow from
supersymmetry and the bps nature (6) of the dyonic instantons. the bosonic col-
lective coordinates are accompanied by 4kn fermionic collective coordinates (this
number is increased to 8kn for the n = 2 theory) and the massive sigma model
described above is supersymmetrised accordingly. indeed, a potential given by the
length of a tri-holomorphic killing vector, as in equations (9) and (10), is of the form
that allows a supersymmetric completion of up to 8 supercharges [10] and it is easily
seen that solutions to (12) saturate the bps-bound of the sigma-model supersym-
metry algebra, reecting their bps nature in the underlying ve-dimensional theory.
in terms of the adhm language, expressions for the (non-kinetic) fermion terms of
the massive sigma model, as well as the supersymmetry transformations, have been
constructed in [4, 5, 6].

6

for the n = 1 theory, one may consider the addition of hypermultiplets in various
representations of the gauge group. there exists a single real, bare mass parameter,
m, which may be assigned to each hypermultiplet. restricting ourselves to nf hyper-
multiplets in the fundamental representation of an su(n) gauge group, and denoting
the bare masses in nf -vector form ~m, these parameters generically break the global
avour group to its cartan sub-algebra and induce a further term in the central charge
of the form ~m  ~s where ~s denotes the charge of a state under the surviving abelian
avour symmetries. an examination of the instanton mass [5, 6] reveals that the
instanton is indeed charged under these avour symmetries, courtesy of fundamental
fermion zero modes.

we may now turn to the question of the bps spectrum in the quantum theory. in
the case of vanishing vev, naive semi-classical quantisation of the scaling collective
coordinate would appear to lead to a continuous spectrum of particles. the inter-
pretation of this is not well understood. with non-vanishing vev, the problem is
dierent. uncharged instantons become singular and their existence in the theory can
only be determined by appealing to new ultra-violet degrees of freedom, generically
arising from string theory. this reects the non-renormalisability of ve-dimensional
yang-mills theory. dyonic instantons however suer from neither of these problems
and it is sensible to attempt to determine their spectrum without recourse to string
theory. quantisation of sigma-models with potential has been considered recently in
[7] in the context of 1/4-bps states. these authors nd that the states of the theory
are described by suitable, normalisable dierential forms satisfying,

i(d  ivk) =   (d  ivk)   ,

where ivk denotes contraction with the killing vector eld v  k and  is the hodge
dual. moreover, the quantisation of electric charge now becomes apparent arising, as
for the more familiar dyons in four-dimensions, through the quantisation of a periodic
variable parametrising the orbits of the killing vector elds.

the bps spectrum of ve-dimensional gauge theories has been derived in the
context of vebrane webs (see for example [11]) where the minimal instanton states
were indeed found to be dyonic. it would be interesting to reproduce these results
from eld theory.

finally, we turn to six-dimensional theories with sixteen supercharges. consider
rst the (1, 1) theory that propagates on the iib vebrane. the methods in this paper
may be employed to construct an instanton string in this theory. the identication of
this soliton with a bound state of d-strings and fundamental strings will be explored
in a forthcoming publication [12]. the relationship to the (2, 0) theory that exists on
coincident iia vebranes is more subtle: the 0+1-dimensional adhm sigma model
with eight supercharges has been proposed as a matrix model description of this theory
[13]. the massive sigma model described above corresponds to the spontaneously

7

broken theory on separated vebranes. it is natural to interpret the states described
by (12) as w-boson strings of the 2-form gauge potential.
