(2.1) x coordinates (d 2)-dimensional sphere. adopted arnowitt- deser-misner scheme, xing horizon located r = requiring near horizon lapse function n behave n 2 = 4 ( r) + o( r)2, (2.2) 2. treat horizon outer boundary (i.e. 0 r ) require metric approach standard de sitter metric boundary. dene theory precisely, one may impose following fall-o conditions near boundary: 4 f = o(n 1), n r = o(n 2), = o(1), n = o(n), (t n rr)g = o(n)g, n + n = o(n 2). (2.3) similar ref. {$9812013$}, dierence equations involving n, case essentially require angular momentum constantly vanishing horizon. given asymptotic behavior metric, easy check near horizon, extrinsic curvature slice constant time behaves like krr = o(n 3), kr = o(n 2), k = o(1). (2.4) spirit work brown henneaux  carlip {$9812013$}, want show gauge symmetries classical theory boundary contains virasoro subalgebra central charge. hamiltonian formulation general relativity, gauge symmetries so-called surface deformations2 preserve fall-o conditions (2.3) near horizon. full generator surface deformations known given l = h + j, rst term bulk term second boundary term : h = z j = dd1x h 1 8g zr= dd2xnnaa + ar + na ako . (2.5) (2.6) {ht,ha} (a = r, ) hamiltonian momentum constraints. surface deformation parameters related spacetime dieomorphism parameters = nt = + n at. preserve fall-o conditions (2.3) required near n = 0, = o(n), r = o(n 2), = o(1). (2.7) 2 readers unfamiliar formulation surface deformations see  details. 5 satisfy lie algebra; part relevant later analysis { m, n}t sd = 1 2 2 1. (2.8) full generator (2.5), need boundary term j, whose variation cancels unwanted surface term variation bulk term h, functional derivative l well dened. easy verify indeed true restrict variations satisfying f /f = o(n), krr/krr = o(n). (2.9) following {$9812013$}, consider particular class surface deformations follows: first, simplicity, specialize cases 0 = n r = n = t,(n ) = t,(n 2), ( 6= ), selected azimuthal angle n o(n) zero. later see help us distinguish left right circular modes . avoid singular behavior horizon angular mode-decomposition t, introduce spherical surface h distance horizon, take n constant surface, tends zero nally take 0 end calculation. second single particular class surface deformations satisfying dif f (s1) algebra following conditions: 1. conformal coordinates dened f dr = ndr, red-shift eect makes dieomorphism light-like, classical nature horizon allows outgoing one horizon, (t + r)t = 0. 2. restrict surface deformations change location horizon dened zero lapse function n 2. impose gtt = 0, gtt 1 n 2 . leads (t n )t + r = 0 h. right circular modes dened (t n )(+) = 0 becomes zero, components left circular modes dened (t + n )() = 0 satisfy relation () = 2n 2 r (n 2),r (t n )t () = 4n 2 (n 2),r tt () . (2.10) 6 3. assume parameter () periodic time, period analytically continued euclidean signature, (1) (2) decomposed fourier modes ()n = anexp{ 2in (t r n )}. (2.11) note angular decomposition would become singular horizon since n = 0 there; however, treatemnt avoided evaluating everything rst h, directly horizon. 4. (1), (2) (3), surface deformaion lie algebra (2.8) becomes { ()m, ()n}t sd = i(n m) ()m+n + ()n n ()m , (2.12) = /4. clearly, (2.12) reduces dif f (s1) impose = 0, implies restrict surface deformations r plane. emphasize (2.12) exact without using fall-o condition, valid away horizon. show class surface deformations generate virasoro algebra, calculate central charge, invoke well-known fact {$9812013$} poisson brackects generic surface deformations close lie algebra surface deformations, { 1, 2}sd, possible central term k: nl, lo = l + k = i(n m)l + k . (2.13) ref. {$9812013$}, shown right-hand side (2.13) given boundary variation (2.5), (2.6), case yields 1 8g zr= dd2x{ 1 f 2 r(f r n)r + 1 f r( r mr n) (m n)}. (2.14) well-dened angular decomposition, integral dened hypersurface h. result turns independent , safe take limit 0 7 nal result. also, overall sign dierence {$9812013$} reversed direction outward unit normal compared black hole horizon. let us substitute modes (2.11) (2.14) evaluate shell de sitter metric h, (2.13) becomes nl, lo|h=0 = 8g n3m+n,0 = (n m)j + k, area cosmological horizon. (2.6) one obtains j = 16g m,o , thus, k = 8g (n3 n 2 2 )m+n,0 (2.15) (2.16) (2.17) dene lm = l, eq. (2.13) gives us virasoro algebra central charge3 c = 3a 2g . (2.18) view classical symmetry resulting quantum theory gravity. thus, infer latter respect (chiral copy of) virasoro algebra central charge (2.18), quantum states characterizing cosmological horizon must form representation algebra conformal weight h = (a/16g)(t /), read (2.16). one applies cardys formula (1.3) count asymptotic density states, get correct entropy (1.2) cosmological horizon. 4 3 formula true value period ; however, preferred value = , horizon free conical singularity. 4to get standard form central term (2.17), one may sht l0, therefore h, c/24 h; also causes shift c 24h c, makes eq.

(3.11) (3.12) using cardys formula leads entropy (1.2) cosmological horizon, inde- pendent parameter q. iv. discussions remarks order. 1) shown close relationship gravitational entropy associated event horizon conformal eld theory found black holes actually wider validity, i.e. holds also cosmological de sitter-like horizon. 2) central charge calculated de sitter horizon, either sec. 2 sec. 3, classical nature. namely central charge virasoro algebra classical theory gravity. 3) classical central charge gives us correct entropy blindly apply cardy formula quantum conformal eld theory still mystery well understood yet. applicability cardy formula de sitter entropy actually involves several key assumptions conformal eld theory associated quantum gravity. assumptions essentially involved conformal eld theory argu- ments black hole horizons, metioned discussed literatures {$9705078$}. would like repeat here. 11 4) however, view fact value classical central charge gives correct value gravitational entropy combined cardy formula, naturally expect value classical central charge would get modied quantum gravity. perhaps suggests correct quantum theory gravity theory quantizes classical theory gravity. rather latter low- energy eective theory former. one us, f.l.l., thanks correspondence dr. solodukhin. work sup- ported part nsf grand phy-9601277. 12
