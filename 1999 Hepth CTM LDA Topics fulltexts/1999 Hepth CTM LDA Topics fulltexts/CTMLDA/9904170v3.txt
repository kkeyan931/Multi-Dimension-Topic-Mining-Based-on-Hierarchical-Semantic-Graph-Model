1. introduction

the dirac equation [1] is considered as the fundamendal equation for the de-
scription of relativistic particles. theoretical calculations within quantum elec-
trodynamics agree with experimental results to highest precision. in addition,
the dirac equation is the basis of the theory of electroweak interactions, quantum
chromodynamics and quantum hadrodynamics. in all cases, the combination of
the relativistic dispersion relation with the pauli spin matrices provides a natural
explanation for, e.g., energy spectra, polarization observables, and cross sections.
nevertheless, one has to ask whether there exist other possibilities to introduce
spin in relativistic quantum physics.

the klein-gordon equation seems to be the most natural starting point for the
description of quantum mechanical wave phenomena, but spin is not considered
in this equation. the present work wants to show that there exists a modication

of the klein-gordon equation, which includes the relativistic spin eects. the
equation can be obtained using an algebraic representation of the relativistic
vector space, where the basis vectors are given by the elements of a cliord
algebra. the importance of such cliord algebras in physical applications has
been investigated by hestenes [2]. in the last years this approach has become more
and more popular in the description of physical processes [3]. in the present study
these concepts will be applied. however, a new relativistic algebra is introduced,
which represents a modication of the quaternion formalism. the quaternion
algebra is altered with the help of the hyperbolic numbers, a number system
which has a long history [4, 5] but is rarely used in physical applications (see
e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]).

the representation matrices of the modied quaternions form the basis vectors
of the relativistic vector space. using these vectors it is possible to dene a
dierential operator which is identical to the dierential operator of the classical
wave equation but transforms formally like a spin operator. the operator will be
applied for the denition of the electron wave equation, which is called quantum
wave equation.

the dirac equation is a rst order dierential equation, whereas the maxwell
equations correspond to a second order dierential equation for the photon eld.
the initial motivation of this paper was the question whether one can nd a
dierential operator which forms the basis for the description of the fundamental
charged fermion eld as well as for the corresponding gauge eld. on the level of
quantum electrodynamics such a unication is possible, since from the quantum
wave equation for photons, constructed with the same dierential operator, the
maxwell equations can be derived.

in a theory for free elds the spin structure of the quantum wave equation is
not important. in this case the dierential operator is identical to the dierential
operator of the classical wave equation, i.e. the mass operator of the poincare
group. therefore, free plane wave states of electrons and photons are investigated
within this group. in particular, the investigation of the spin is needed for the
construction of the theory.

the introduction of interactions can be done with the conventional method
of minimal substitution, leading to a lagrangian which is invariant under gauge
transformations. this opens the possibility to compare the formalism with the
dirac theory. it can be shown that the quantum wave equation corresponds to
the quadratic form of the dirac equation. furthermore, the inhomogeneous terms
of the maxwell equations are given in the correct form. this connection supports
the assumption that the calculation of physical processes will give similar results
as in the conventional theories.

the organisation of the paper is as follows. in sections 2 and 3 hyperbolic
numbers and relativistic vectors including their lorentz and poincare transfor-

2

mation properties are investigated. in section 4 the quantum wave equation for
electrons is introduced. plane wave states for electrons are investigated in sec-
tion 5. the wave equation can be used also for anticommuting eld operators.
this will be shown in sections 6 and 7. in section 9 the maxwell equations are
derived starting from the quantum wave equation for photons. the photon plane
wave states are investigated in section 10. interactions between electrons and
photons are introduced and the equations of motion of quantum electrodynamics
are calculated in section 11. in section 12 the connection with the dirac theory
is discussed.

2. complex hyperbolic numbers

in the present investigation hyperbolic numbers are used for the mathematical
formalation of the electron and the photon wave equation. since these numbers
are rarely used in physical applications a brief introduction of this number system
is given.

dened as

in combination with the complex numbers the hyperbolic numbers x  h are
(1)

x = x0 + jx1 ,

x0, x1  c ,

where the hyperbolic unit j has the property

j2 = 1 .

(2)

this leads to the following rules for the multiplication and addition of two hy-
perbolic numbers x = x0 + jx1 and y = y0 + jy1

x + y = (x0 + y0) + j(x1 + y1) ,

xy = (x0y0 + x1y1) + j(x0y1 + x1y0) .

(3)

since there exist non-zero elements which have no inverse these numbers form a
commutative ring. the hyperbolic unit j provides a relation between the hyper-
bolic sine, cosine and the exponential function

cosh  + j sinh  = ej ,

(4)

which can be derived in the same way as the corresponding relation for the
complex numbers.

two conjugations will be used. the conventional complex conjugation changes

the sign of the complex unit i but leaves the hyperbolic unit j unchanged

x = x

0 + jx
1 .

(5)

in addition, a hyperbolic conjugation will be introduced which changes only the
sign of the hyperbolic unit

x = x0  jx1 .

(6)

the properties and denitions of the hyperbolic numbers presented here are
sucient for the following investigations. more informations about the hyperbolic
number system can be found e.g. in the refs. [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

3. relativistic vectors and the spin group

3.1. relativistic vectors

the relevance of cliord algebras for the mathematical description of physical
theories has been investigated by hestenes [2]. he reinterpretated the elements of
the pauli or the dirac algebra as the basis vectors of a vector space. in the same
way the present study will be based on such a geometric algebra. however, a new
relativistic algebra is introduced, which represents a modication of hamiltons
quaternions.

be expressed as follows

a contravariant lorentz vector with the coordinates x = (x0, xi)  c4 can
(7)

x = x .

in contrast to the formalism used in the context of the su (2) group, the ba-
sis vectors  are made up of the unity and the elements of the pauli algebra
multiplicated by the hyperbolic unit j

 = (1, ji) .

two other notations for the vector x to be used in the following are

x = x0 + jx = x01 + jxii .

(8)

(9)

this means the elements of the pauli algebra will be included in the following
in the three-dimensional vectors x = xii. this notation has become popular in
the physical applications of cliord algebras. the pauli algebra is characterized
by its multiplication rules, which can be written as

ij = ij1 + iijkk .

(10)

using the pauli matrices as the explicit representation of i, the vector x can be
expressed in terms of a 2  2 matrix according to

x =(cid:18) x0 + jx3

jx1 + ijx2

jx1  ijx2
x0  jx3 (cid:19) .

(11)

the formalism is not restricted to four-dimensional vectors. adding a vector
which is multiplicated by the factor ij an eight-dimensional multivector can be
constructed

z = x + ijy .

4

(12)

x denotes the vector contribution, whereas y is interpretated as a pseudovector.
this interpretation follows from a comparision with the maxwell equations, which
are given in section 9. the eight complex coordinates of z in eq. (12) are the
maximum number of coordinates that can be placed in a 2  2 matrix. this
means, comparing with the sixteen-dimensional complex vector space of the 4 4
dirac matrices, the new relativistic formalism halves the number of dimensions
arising from the mathematical structure of the vector space.
in the following
only the real vector coordinates of the multivector will be considered, i.e. the
investigation is restricted to the four-dimensional minkowski space.

a scalar product between two vectors can be dened using the trace of the

matrix xy

h x | y i =

1
2

t r ( xy ) .

(13)

the symbol x = x   denotes transposition, complex and hyperbolic conjugation
of the matrix. xy corresponds to a matrix multiplication of the two 22 matrices
x and y . as stated above, the pauli matrices can be considered as the basis
vectors of the relativistic vector space   e. these basis vectors form a non-
cartesian orthogonal basis with respect to the scalar product dened in eq. (13)

where the metric tensor g is a diagonal 4  4 matrix with the matrix elements

h e | e i = g ,

(14)

g =

0
0
0 1

.

(15)

the metric tensor can be used as usual for raising and lowering the indices.
eq. (13) can now be expressed in the conventional notation. one nds

h x | y i = h e | xy | e i = xy ,

and the innitesimal distance corresponds to

ds2 = h dx | dx i = dxdx .

(16)

(17)

as an example the energy-momentum vector of a free classical pointlike par-
ticle, moving with the velocity v relative to the observer, is expressed in terms
of the matrix algebra. the relativistic momentum vector for this particle can be
written as

p =

e
c

+ jp = mc exp (j) ,

(18)

5

with c denoting the velocity of light,  the rapidity, e the energy and p the
momentum of the particle. the rapidity is dened as

tanh =

v
c

=

pc
e

,

(19)

where  = || and p = |p|. rapidity and momentum point into the same direction
n = v/|v| as the velocity.
in quantum mechanics energy and momentum are substituted by dierential
operators. with  =  the momentum operator is then given by

p = i .

(20)

this operator forms the basis of the wave equation with spin, which will be
introduced in section 4. in the following c and  will be set equal to one.

3.2. lorentz and poincare transformations

in analogy to the relation between su (2) and so(3) the transformation prop-
erties of the vectors dened in the last subsection give a relation between so(3, 1)
and a spin group dened as an extension of the unitary group su (2). in the fol-
lowing rotations and boosts will be investigated. the rotation parameters  are
dened with the conventions of ref. [11]. the rotation of a vector has the form

x 7 x  = rx r ,
r = exp (i/2) ,

(21)

where x = x. in addition, a vector can be boosted to a dierent system. the
boost parameters  are chosen to make the considered vector describe an object
moving into the positive direction for positive values of . in many investigations
a dierent sign convention is used. for the boosts one nds the transformation
rule

x 7 x  = bxb ,
b = exp (j/2) .

(22)

the dagger in the above equations includes only a hermitian conjugation and not
a hyperbolic conjugation. for the boost transformation one nds the relation
b = b, whereas the inverse of the boost operator corresponds to b1 = b. the
explicit matrix representations of the boost matrices b are

bx =(cid:18) cosh 1/2

j sinh 1/2

j sinh 1/2

cosh 1/2 (cid:19)

(23)

6

for a boost in the direction of the x-axis and

by =(cid:18) cosh 2/2 ij sinh 2/2

cosh 2/2 (cid:19) , bz =  ej3/2

ij sinh 2/2

0

0

ej3/2 !

(24)

for boosts along the y- and the z-axis.

to proof that these transformation matrices are a representation of the lorentz
group the corresponding lie algebra has to be investigated. before doing this,
the three-dimensional dot and cross products will be introduced, which are given
for the three-dimensional vectors x and y as

x  y = re{xy} = xiyi , x  y = im{xy} = ijkxiyjk .

(25)

if boosts and rotations are combined as follows

x 7 x  = lxl ,
l = exp (i(j   + k  )) ,

the innitesimal generators of these transformations can be identied with

ji =

i
2

, ki = ij

i
2

.

(26)

(27)

with the commutation relations of the pauli matrices one can derive that the
generators satisfy the lie algebra of the lorentz group so(3, 1)

[ ji , jj ] = iijkj k ,
[ki, jj ] = iijkk k ,
[ki, kj] = iijkj k .

(28)

therefore, the matrices r and b given in eqs. (21) and (22) can be recognized
as the transformation matrices of the covering, i.e. the spin group of so(3, 1).

it is possible to express the lorentz transformations in the conventional tensor
formalism. using the generators of the spin s = 1
2 representation given in eq. (27)
the relativistic generalization of the spin angular momentum operator can be
dened as

sij = ijkj k , s0i = si0 = ki

(29)

and the lorentz transformations given in eq. (26) can be formulated according
to

l = exp (

i
2

s ) .

(30)

the boost parameters  are given as ij = ijkk and i0 = i.

7

the relativistic orbital angular momentum can be introduced in terms of vec-
tor operators for position and momentum obeying the following commutation
relations

[x , x  ] = 0 ,

[p , p  ] = 0 ,

[p , x  ] = ig .

(31)

in the following the convention is used that big letters denote operators and
small letters numbers. the relativistic orbital angular momentum is dened as
l = x p   x  p . if the operators ji and ki are given according to

ji =

1
2

ijkljk , ki = l0i = li0 ,

(32)

these generators satisfy the lie algebra of the poincare group, i.e. beside the
relations given in eq. (28) one nds the following commutation relations

[ ji , p0] = 0 ,
[ ji , pj] = iijkp k ,
[ki, p0] = ipi ,
[ki, pj] = iijp0 .

(33)

the lorentz transformations corresponding to eq. (30) can now be expressed

as

l = exp (

i
2

l ) ,

(34)

the boost parameters  are dened as ij = ijkk and i0 = i. this transfor-
mation is acting on relativistic hilbert space functions, which will not be specied
here further. to complete the transformation properties the translations are in-
troduced by

t = exp (ipa) .

(35)

some remarks on the conventions should be made here. in the so(3) sub-
space of the lorentz group, which is indicated by the roman indices, there is
no dierence between upper and lower components, i.e. xi = xi. the relativis-
tic contravariant vector is then given as x = (x0, xi) and the covariant vec-
tor as x = (x0,xi). a similar convention is made for tensors. one nds
e.g. for the zero-components of the orbital angular momentum l0 = (0, l0i) and
l0 = (0,l0i), where l0i = l0i. for the relativistic spin matrices  a special
notation is used in which i furthermore corresponds to a pauli matrix.

4. the quantum wave equation for electrons

the dirac equation is accepted as the fundamental relativistic equation for the
description of fermionic particles. in the present work a relativistic wave equation

8

will be introduced, which is closely related to the classical wave equation. the
new equation will be called quantum wave equation. the dierential operator of
the quantum wave equation is formed by the momentum operator p multiplied
by the dual operator p , which is dual in the sense that a scalar is obtained if the
operator product is inserted between two dual spinor functions. therefore, the
following ansatz is made for the quantum wave equation

p p (x) = m2(x) ,

(36)

where p = i. the dierential operator p p can be replaced by p p  since the
in the following investigations there are no
momentum operator is hermitian.
dierences between these two choices even if interactions are introduced. the
wave function (x) has the general structure

(x) = (x) + j(x) ,

(37)

where (x) and (x) are two-component spinor functions. they depend on the
four space-time coordinates x. the transformation properties of the operator p
can be deduced by a hermitian and hyperbolic conjugation of the corresponding
equations given in the last section.

in order to clarify the structure of the quantum wave equation, some explicit
details are presented. the pauli matrices in eq. (36) become apparant if one
inserts def. (7)

p p (x) = m2(x) .

(38)

the tensor  represents the spin structure which is acting on the spinor func-
tion. the explicit form is obtained by a matrix multiplication of the 2  2 basis
matrices. the tensor can be separated into a symmetric and an antisymmetric
contribution

where g corresponds to the metric tensor and the antisymmetric part is given
by

  = g  i ,

(40)




the antisymmetric contribution  is directly related to the relativistic gener-
alization of the spin angular momentum operator. using the generators of the
spin s = 1

2 representation given in eq. (29) one nds

s =


2

.

9

(41)

since p p  is symmetric and  =  the operator p p is equivalent to
p p = pp .
at this point the particular form of the dierential operator seems to be with-
out any eect. however, the spin information which is included in the dierential
operator of the quantum wave equation becomes essential if the momentum op-
erators are replaced by covariant derivates. the inuence of this spin structure
can be illustrated by the following example. coordinate and momentum vector
satisfy the relation

(42)
where l = x p   x p  corresponds to the relativistic orbital angular mo-
mentum.

x p = xp   isl ,

5. electron plane wave states

in this section the solutions of the quantum wave equation for electrons will
be studied in the free non-interacting case. due to the simplication of the
dierential operator p p = pp , which is identical with the mass operator of
the poincare group, the solutions will be expressed in terms of the corresponding
plane wave representations. the section is separated into three parts. the rst
part describes how the plane wave states can be generated. the second part gives
additional information on the relativistic bracket notation, which will be applied
in the following. the third section investigates the connection between spin and
pauli-lubanski vector.

5.1. induced representation method

the irreducible representations of the poincare group were investigated by
wigner [12]. he found that the plane wave states are labelled by the mass m and
the spin s. in the present work these states will be generated with the induced
representation method, which is described e.g. in ref. [11].
in this method a
state vector is dened within the little group of the poincare group, i.e. the
subgroup that leaves a particular standard vector invariant. an arbitrary state
is then generated with the remaining transformations which were not considered
in the little group. in the following the transformation rules of section 3.2 will
be applied.

for electrons (m2 > 0) one can choose the standard vector p

t = (m, 0, 0, 0).
the little group of this standard vector is so(3). the explicit representation
of the spin s = 1
2 states is given by the pauli spinor, which will be denoted
by | i = . the polarization is chosen along the z-axis. for the description
of the mass quantum number m a ket | pt i is introduced. by doing this, the
translations, as one group of the remaining transformations, are taken into ac-
count. the properties of the momentum kets will be investigated separately in

10

the next section. note, that though the kets are represented by | pt i = | p
t  i,
they correspond to usual hilbert space elements which depend only on the four-
momentum p
t . one therefore starts with the following state, which corresponds
to a (m, s)-representation of the poincare group

| i  | pt i = |  pt i .

(43)

now, the boosts, as the last group of the remaining transformations, are acting
on this state according to

d(b)|  pt i = b | bptb i ,

(44)

where b has been dened in eq. (22). since the boost transforms from the rest
frame to a particular frame, in which the state is described by the momentum
p = bptb, the boost parameters can be identied with the rapidity. with this
information it is possible to calculate the explicit form of the relativistic spinor.
in analogy to the dirac formalism one can introduce the notation [13]

explicitly the boost matrix can be written as

u(p, ) = b .

b = exp (j/2) = cosh /2 + jn sinh /2 ,

where the rapidity  satises the following relations

cosh /2 =r p0 + m

2m

,

sinh /2 =r p0  m

2m

.

inserting these results into eq. (45) the spinor is given by

u(p, ) =r p0 + m

2m (cid:18)1 +

jp

p0 + m(cid:19)  .

(45)

(46)

(47)

(48)

the antiparticle spinor is constructed in analogy to the dirac theory, where
upper and lower components are interchanged compared to the particle spinor.
in the formalism presented here, this can be done by multiplying the particle
spinor by the hyperbolic unit j, i.e. v(p, ) = ju(p, ). therefore, one can write

v(p, ) =r p0 + m

2m (cid:18) p

p0 + m

+ j(cid:19)  .

(49)

the normalization and the completeness of the plane wave states can be calcu-
lated as follows

hu(p, )|u(p, )i = + ,
hv(p, )|v(p, )i =  .

11

(50)

to explain this notation the scalar product of two plane wave spinors is deter-
mined explicitly

hu(p, )|u(p, )i = u(p, )u(p, ) = 



bb =  .

(51)

the antiparticle spinor is normalized to 1, which is due do the additional j-
factor and its hyperbolic conjugated counterpart j = j. note, that there
is no explicit orthogonality between particle and antiparticle spinor. however,
if the spinors appear in combination with the momentum kets of the states,
orthogonality of particle and antiparticle states will be restored. this can be
checked with the relations given in the following sections.

for the completeness one nds

x

|u(p, )ihu(p, )| = x

|v(p, )ihv(p, )| = 1 .

(52)

together with bras and kets for the momentum these expressions correspond to
negative and positive energy projectors, respectively. in contrast to the appro-
priate expressions in the dirac theory, they have a simple matrix structure and
no momentum dependence.

the transformation properties of the states are

d(l)| u(p, ) p i = (lu(p, ))|lp l i ,
d(t )| u(p, ) p i = u(p, ) exp (ipa)| p i ,

(53)

where the lorentz transformations are performed with the matrix l of eq. (26).
the notation presented here was introduced in analogy to the dirac formalism
and it therefore adopted the expression u(p, ).
in the following the abstract
notation | q  p i will be used, where a quantum number denoting a particle with
q = 1 and an antiparticle with q = 1 is introduced. the explicit form of these
states is
(54)

| +  p i = | u(p, ) p i ,

|   p i = | v(p, ) p i .

again the antiparticle state is introduced by denition. a proper derivation of
these states requires the investigation of the discrete lorentz transformations.

5.2. the relativistic | p i and | x i representations

in the last subsection the kets | p i and | x i for relativistic hilbert space
elements related to a (m2 > 0) representation of the poincare group were intro-
duced. in the following the normalization and completeness of the states will be
summarized, where the description follows the covariant conventions given e.g. in
refs. [11, 14]. the spin degrees of freedom will be considered separately in the
next section.

12

the normalization and completeness of the states is expressed in an abstract

notation. the normalization is given by

h p | p  i = (p  p ) ,
and the completeness can be written as

h x | x  i = (x  x ) ,

z dp | p ih p | = 1 ,

z dx | x ih x | = 1 .

(55)

(56)

the dependence on the mass m is suppressed in the bras and kets. the ex-
plicit covariant representation of the momentum delta function is given [11, 14]
according to

(p  p ) = (2)3 2p0 3(p  p) ,

where p0 =pp2 + m2 is xed by the mass shell condition. the integration over

dp corresponds to

z dp =z

d3p

(2)3 2p0 ,

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

with d3p = dp1dp2dp3.

using these representations the abstract completeness and normalization of
eqs. (55) and (56) are consistent in momentum space. in coordinate space the
situation is more complicated. for the unity expressed in terms of bras and kets
one can dene

where the abbreviation

z dx | x ih x | =z d3x| x i



p 0h x | ,

a



p  b = a(p b)  (p a)b

has been introduced. to investigate the properties of the delta function in coor-
dinate space the representation of the momentum ket is needed

h x | p i = exp (ipx) .

(61)

with this expression the covariant delta function can be calculated using the
completeness of the momentum kets

(x  x ) =z dp h x | p ih p | x  i =z
the delta function is therefore equivalent to the positive frequency part +(xx)
of the invariant function i(x  x) given in ref. [13]. this reects the fact that

(2)3 2p0 exp (ip(x  x)) .

(62)

d3p

13

these considerations are restricted to positive energy states. the action of the
delta function applied to the state h x | p i is as follows
z dx(x   x)h x | p i =z dp z dx h x  | p  ih p  | x ih x | p i

=z

d3p

(2)3 2p0 z d3x eip



(xx)

p 0 eipx = h x  | p i .
(63)

this shows that the explicit representations are consistent with the abstract com-
pleteness given in eq. (56).

using the relations given above one can transform a momentum dependent
function (p) = h p |  i, which is given on the mass shell, into the coordinate
space according to

whereas in the opposite direction the transformation has the form

(x) =z

d3p

(2)3 2p0 eipx(p) ,

(p) =z d3xeipx(p0 + i0)(x) .

(64)

(65)

in the next sections the notation presented here will be applied e.g. in the second
quantization of the electron eld on the equal-time plane.

5.3. the pauli-lubanski vector and spin operators

to show that the plane wave states derived in the rst part of this section
correspond to an irreducible representation of the poincare group, the connection
of these states with the second casimir operator, the pauli-lubanski vector, will
be investigated. since the spin s = 1
2 representation is considered, the spin
angular momentum operators of eq. (29) will be used for the denition of the
pauli-lubanski vector

w  =

1
2

 sp = s p ,

(66)

where s is the dual tensor of the relativistic angular momentum tensor. it is
interesting that the dual tensor can also be calculated using the relation s =
ijs , which can be derived from eqs. (40) and (41). in the notation of eq. (7)
the pauli-lubanski vector has the form

w = j  p  j(j p 0 + k  p ) ,

(67)

where in the expression j = j ii the pauli matrices in j i = i/2 are coordinates
of the pauli matrices i in the basis.

14

with the pauli-lubanski vector the relativistic spin operators can be dened,
where the investigation follows the methods given in [15, 16]. one chooses a set
of four orthogonal vectors n() satisfying the relation

using these vectors the spin operators are dened according to

n()
 n() = g .

si =

1
m

wn(i) .

(68)

(69)

if the plane wave states derived in the rst part of this section shall be eigenstates
of the spin operators, a particular set of orthogonal vectors n() = (n0(), nk())
has to be introduced

n(0) =(cid:18) p 0

m

,

p k

m(cid:19) , n(i) =(cid:18) p i

m

, ki +

p kp i

m(p 0 + m)(cid:19) .

(70)

in the rest frame, these vectors reduce to the canonical orthogonal system. the
three spin operators can be regarded as the relativistic generalization of the non-
relativistic spin operators. they can be expressed as (s = sii)

s =

1

m(cid:18)j p 0 + k  p  (j  p )

p

p 0 + m(cid:19) .

(71)

for the relativistic spin operators one nds s2 = s(s + 1) = ww /m2. the
operators satisfy the commutation relations of the little group so(3). the third
component of the spin vector can be used to characterize the polarization.

the spin operators were constructed in that way, that they coincide with
boosted generators j i, where the boost matrices are acting on the coordinates of
j = j ii

si = bj i b .

(72)

as well as in the derivation of the plane wave states, the boost parameters in
b have to be identied with the rapidity of the state vector. from the above
equation follows that under arbitrary lorentz transformations the spin operators
have to transform according to

si 7 si = lsi l ,

(73)

where l corresponds to the lorentz tranformation matrix given in eq. (26). from
eq. (72) one can deduce that it is sucient to dene the spin in the rest frame
of the state, according to the non-relativistic description with the non-relativistic
spin operators j i = i/2, whereas the boost operators k i = ijj i are not used to

15

characterize the single-particle state. vector products of the form a b, with two
arbitrary vectors a and b, transform in the same way as the spin operators

(a b) 7 (a b) = l(a b) l .

(74)

therefore, p p was chosen as the dierential operator of the quantum wave equa-
tion. this guarantees that the operator, which is acting between two spinor
functions, shows the correct transformation property.

now, the properties of the positive energy states can be summarized. the plane

wave states for positive energies are eigenstates of the four operators {pp , p , ww , s3}
and satisfy the relations

pp  | +  p i = m2 | +  p i ,
p  | +  p i = p | +  p i ,

ww  | +  p i = m2s(s + 1)| +  p i ,

s3 | +  p i = | +  p i .

(75)

together with the negative energy states one nds the following normalization

h q  p | qp i = qq  (p  p )

and completeness

x z dp | +  p ih +  p | = 1 , x z dp |   p ih  p | = 1 ,

(76)

(77)

where the completeness is restricted to the subspaces of positive and negative
energy, respectively. with these states the solution of the quantum wave equation
(x) can be expressed as the following plane wave expansion

(x) =x z dp (h x | +  p ih +  p |  i + h x |   p ih  p |  i)

d3p

=x z

(2)32p0 (cid:0)u(p, )eipx b(p, ) + v(p, )eipx d(p, )(cid:1) . (78)

at this point the solution is understood as an expansion of a single particle wave
function.

6. variational principle and current conservation

a second order dierential equation is expected to be unsuitable for the de-
scription of fermionic quantum elds. therefore, some quantum eld theoretical

16

aspects will be investigated in the next two sections. in this section a lagrangian
for a free non-interacting theory will be introduced which leads to the quantum
wave equation using standard variational techniques. the lagrange equations,
currents, and conserved quantities will be derived.

the initial point of this investigation is a lagrangian of the form

l(x) = (x)p p (x)  m2 (x)(x) ,

(79)

where both momentum vectors are acting to the right side. the lagrangian has
the property of being invariant under hermitian including hyperbolic conjuga-
tion, i.e. l(x) = l(x). note, that the wave functions are two-component spinor
functions and a product of two spinorfunction   ii implies a contraction
of the two-component eld functions. the same convention is used in expressions
like the following

l

()

() 

l

(i)

(i) .

(80)

the equations of motion, currents, and conserved quantities can be derived as
usual from a variational principle which is applied to the action. the investigation
presented here follows the common treatment of this topic, which can be found
e.g. in ref. [14]. therefore, only the main points shall be discussed briey. the
action is dened as

(81)
where d4x = dx0dx1dx2dx3. l(x) is a function of l(, , ,  , x). the
variation of this lagrangian is then given by

s =z d4xl(x) ,

l =

l


 +

l

()

() +  

l
 

+ ( )

l

( )

+ (l)x ,

(82)

where the variation of the coordinates and the variation of the wave function is
dened as

x 7 x = x + x ,
(x) 7 (x) = (x) + (x) .

(83)

both variations vanish on a boundary r. using l the variation of the action
s can be calculated. applying the principle of least action, s = 0, to this
expression one obtains the lagrange equations

l
  

l

()

= 0 ,

l
   

l

( )

= 0 .

(84)

from the surface terms of s one can derive the conserved current, which has
the form

j  =

l

()

 +  
17

l
( )  x .

(85)

 corresponds to the total variaton (x) = (x) + (x) and  denotes the
energy momentum tensor dened as

 =

l

()

( ) + ( )

l
( )  gl .

(86)

the quantum wave equation can now be derived with the help of the lagrange
equations (84), where it is useful to rewrite the lagrangian in analogy to eq. (38)
to separate the dynamical variables from the basis matrices.

the currents for global phase transformations and translations can be cal-
culated with the denition of the current given in eq. (85). a global phase
transformation of the wave function is expressed as

this leads to the total eld variations

(x) 7 (x) = ei(x) .

 = i ,   = i 

(87)

(88)

and to x = 0. using the relation p p = pp  the current can be calculated as

j (x) = (x)


p  (x) .

(89)

the following sections will show that if interactions are considered the spin struc-
ture becomes important and the appropriate expression for the current will be
more complicated.

with the formalism developed in section 5.2 one can relate the charge, dened

on the equal-time plane, with a scalar product in the relativistic hilbert space

h  | i =z dx h  | x ih x | i =z d3x (x)


p 0 (x) .

this yields the relation

q = h  |  i =z dx h  | x ih x |  i =z d3xj 0(x) .

(90)

(91)

the four-momentum of a classical eld conguration is related to the transla-

tions, which are characterized by the following variations

x =  ,  = 0 .

(92)

the conserved current corresponds to the energy-momentum tensor, which has
in the case of free electrons the structure

(x) = (p  (x))(p  (x))  (p  (x))(p (x))  gl(x) ,

18

(93)

where  =  = . with this expression one can dene the four-momentum
of the eld conguration according to

p  =z d3x 0(x) .

(94)

a certain amount of energy is able to create electron-positron pairs, i.e. to bring
an electron from a negative energy state to a positive energy state. the negative
energy spectrum, which is naturally included in a relativistic treatment of physics,
has the consequence that a relativistic quantum theory can only be constructed
within a many-particle framework. one possibility to go in this direction is
to quantize the elds, i.e. to consider them as operator valued quantum elds
which are acting between many-particle states. this procedure is called second
quantization and will be performed in the next section.

7. canonical quantization of free electrons

in contrast to common belief the canonical quantization is straightforward
in a theory of non-interacting electrons based on the klein-gordon equation.
the standard techniques of the canonical quantization [13] and the partial wave
expansion derived in the foregoing sections will be used to demonstrate this.

the lagrangian given in eq. (79) is equivalent to the lagrangian of the klein-

gordon equation

l = (x)pp (x)  m2 (x)(x) .

(95)

for the second quantization the conjugated momentum will be introduced as
usual

(x) =

l

(0(x))

= 0 (x) .

(96)

the eld quantization follows from implying equal-time anticommutation rela-
tions on the eld variables

{i (x), j(y)}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=y0
= +iij3(x  y) ,
{ i(x), j(y)}(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=y0 = iij3(x  y) .

(97)

subscripts where introduced to indicate the two-component structure of the elds.
one can show that these relations are leading to the heisenberg equations of

motion

[ p , (x)] = i(x) ,

[ p , (x)] = i (x) ,

(98)

where the momentum of the eld conguration p  given in eq. (94) has been
changed to a many-particle operator p  including the operator valued elds (x)
and (x).

19

from the plane wave expansion of  given in eq. (78) one can project out the

amplitudes b(p, ) and d(p, ) according to

b(p, )  h +  p |  i =z dx h +  p | x ih x |  i

 z d3x eipx u(p, )


p 0 (x) ,

d(p, )  h  |   p i =z dx h  | x ih x |   p i

 z d3x (x)


p 0 v(p, )eipx .

(99)

the two-component spinor functions u(p, ) and (x) have to be contracted
according to the convention introduced in the last section. using the anticom-
mutation relations for the fermion elds one can derive the anticommutators

{b(p, ), b(p, )} = {d(p, ), d(p, )} =  (p  p ) .

(100)

the many-particle operators q and p  given in eqs. (91) and (94) can be ex-
pressed in terms of the operator valued amplitudes b(p, ) and d(p, ) according
to

and

q =z d3x : j 0(x) :
=x z dp (b(p, )b(p, )  d(p, )d(p, ))

p  =z d3x : 0(x) :
=x z dp p (b(p, )b(p, ) + d(p, )d(p, )) .

(101)

(102)

the feynman propagator, which is dened as the time ordered vacuum ex-
pectation value of the eld operators, can be calculated with the results of the
preceding equations. adding a small imaginary part to the denominator one nds

isf ( x, y )ij = h 0| t (i(x) j(y))| 0i

= iijz d4p

(2)4

eip(xy)
pp  m2 + i

(103)

,

where the p0 components in the integrand are not xed by the mass shell condi-

tion, i.e. p0 6=pp2 + m2. from the above expression follows that the dierential

20

operator of the quantum wave equation acting on the feynman propagator is
equal to the four-dimensional delta function

(p p  m2)sf (x, y) = 4(x  y) ,

(104)

where the matrix indices are not indicated.

the consistence of the above equations is not self-evident if one uses anticom-
muting elds. the key point, which is responsible for these results, is the negative
normalization and completeness of the antiparticle spinors given in eqs. (50) and
(52). the negative normalization is also part of the dirac theory. it is therefore
essentially the same mechanism which provides a consistent treatment of second
quantization in the formalism presented in this paper.

the main intention of this brief discussion was to show that a second order
dierential equation for fermions is in accordance with basic quantum eld the-
oretical considerations. in the following, the elds will be considered again as
single-particle wave functions.

8. charged massless fermions

in the preceding sections massive electrons have been studied. with regard
to the discussion of photons, the m2 = 0 representation of the poincare group
will be investigated in the following. the discussion is restricted to charged
fermions, i.e. one can expect that electrons at very high energy can be described
by these states. furthermore, the free non-interacting electron eld may obey
this equation. the quantum wave equation for massless fermions has the form

p p (x) = 0 .

(105)

again, the spinor will be dened within the little group of a standard vector.
since massless particles are moving with the velocity of light they have no rest
frame. therefore, the standard frame will be dened as the system in which the
momentum is directed along the polarization axis.
if the particle is polarized
along the z-axis the positive-energy standard vector is given as

p
t = (|p3|, 0, 0, h|p3|) ,

(106)

where h = p3/|p3| denotes the helicity of the particle.
to the z-axis

to obtain an arbitrary momentum vector p one has to boost perpendicular

p = (|p3| cosh ,|p3|n1 sinh ,|p3|n2 sinh , h|p3|) .

(107)

21

the unit vector ni
the perpendicular momentum vector pi
the relation

 = (n1, n2, 0) characterizes the direction of the boost. with
 = (p1, p2, 0) the rapidity is dened by

tanh  =

p
p0 ,

(108)

where p = |p|. using  = n the boost can be written again in the form
b = exp (j/2). the components of the pauli-lubanski vector in the standard
frame of eq. (106) are

w 0 = h|p3|j 3 ,
w 1 = |p 3|(j 1 + hk 2) ,
w 2 = |p 3|(j 2  hk 1) ,
w 3 = |p 3|j 3 .

(109)

the operators w 0 and w 3 are linear dependent and will be represented in the
following by j 3. the three generators j 3, w 1 and w 2 satisfy the lie algebra of
the euklidean group in two dimensions

[ j 3 , w 1] = iw 2 ,

[ j 3 , w 2] = iw 1 ,

[w 1, w 2] = 0 ,

(110)

which denes the little group of the m2 = 0 representation. to derive the above
equations the angular momentum operators have to be dened with the orbital
angular momentum operators of eq. (32).

for the denition of the spin one has to insert the generators j i = i/2 and
k i = iji/2 into eq. (109). then one nds in the standard frame and therefore
in all frames

ww  = 0 ,

(111)

i.e. the spin is given in the degenerate spin s = 0 representation of e2. the basis
vectors are chosen as eigenvectors of j 3 with the eigenvalues  =  1
2 . therefore,
one can adopt def. (43) with the pauli spinor |i and the standard momentum
p
t of eq. (106). a general basis vector is obtained using eq. (44) with the boost
parameters dened above. this leads to the spinor

u(p, ) =s p0 + |p3|

2|p3| (cid:18)1 +

jp

p0 + |p3|(cid:19)  .

(112)

the antiparticle spinor is obtained as in eq. (49), i.e. the above expression is
multiplied by the hyperbolic unit j. this ensures that the second quantization for
charged anticommuting elds can be performed consistently due to the negative
normalization of the spinor

v(p, ) =s p0 + |p3|

2|p3| (cid:18) p
p0 + |p3|

22

+ j(cid:19)  .

(113)

the transformation properties of the basis vectors are the same as in eq. (53).

it remains to dene the spin operator. a set of four orthogonal vectors n() =

(n0(), nk()) can be introduced

n(0) =(cid:18) p 0
|p 3|

,

p k


|p 3|(cid:19) , n(i) =(cid:18) p i
|p 3|



, ki +

p k
p i

|p 3|(p 0 + |p 3|)(cid:19) .



(114)

for the degenerate representation of e2 one operator is sucient to characterize
the state vectors [11]. this operator is chosen as follows

s3 =

1
|p 3|

w n(3) .

(115)

the spin operator corresponds again to a boosted generator j 3. explicitly written
one nds

s3 =

1
|p 3|

(j 3p 0 + k 1p 2  k 2p 1) .

(116)

the results can be summarized now.

| u(p, ) p i the particle kets are characterized by the operators {pp , p , ww , s3}
and satisfy the relations

if one uses the notation | +  p i =

pp  | +  p i = 0 ,

p  | +  p i = p | +  p i ,

ww  | +  p i = 0 ,

s3 | +  p i = | +  p i .

(117)

the plane wave expansion is formally equivalent to eq. (78), but the spinors
u(p, ) and v(p, ) have to be replaced with the specic m2 = 0 form given in
eqs. (112) and (113). the states could also be characterized by the helicity,
whereas in the description presented here the helicity is xed and the two polar-
izations are used to characterize the two possible states. changing the chosen
helicity leads to an interchange of the two polarizations.

9. the quantum wave equation for photons

the motivation for this work was the question whether one can nd a dif-
ferential operator which forms the basis for the description of the fundamental
fermion eld as well as for the corresponding gauge eld, i.e. whether there exists
an universal equation of the form

d(x) = m2

(x) ,

(118)

where d is a suitable dierential operator, (x) denotes the considered quantum
eld, and m2
  0 corresponds to the mass of the particle. this means, for

23

fundamental particles the information about the particle spin should be included
only in the eld (x) and not in the dierential operator of the wave equation.
in quantum electrodynamics, i.e. more precisely (x)  {(x), a(x)}, this uni-
cation is possible, where d = p p has to be chosen as the underlying dierential
operator. it will be shown that the maxwell equations can be derived starting
from this unied wave equation. for free photon elds one therefore begins with

p p a(x) = 0 ,

(119)

where a(x) = a0(x) + ja(x) is a vector eld and m2
netic elds

a = 0. with the electromag-

ei(x) = 0ai(x)  ia0(x) , bi(x) = ijkjak(x) ,

(120)

one can show that eq. (119) can be expressed in terms of these elds according
to

p p a(x) =   e(x)  0c(x)

+ij  b(x)
j(  b(x)  0e(x)  c(x))
i(  e(x) + 0b(x)) = 0 .

(121)

the calculation has to be done in a specic order. in the rst step the expression
p a(x) has to be evaluated. in the second step the operator p is acting on the
electromagnetic elds. calculating p p = pp  is leading to the classical wave
equation for the vector potential.

in the quantum wave equation the four homogeneous maxwell equations are
included. the straightforward derivation provides two additional terms including
the eld

c(x) = a(x) .

(122)

in the lorentz gauge this term vanishes and the correct form of the maxwell equa-
tions is restored. this indicates that the gauge should not be chosen arbitrary,
i.e. the vector potential should be perpendicular to the momentum operator in
the relativistic sense

pa(x) = 0 .

(123)

otherwise, the six-component tensor structure of the electromagnetic eld would
be modied and extended to a seventh component, which can not be incorporated
into an antisymmetric second rank tensor.

in this formalism gauge invariance is not satised as naturally as in the conven-
tional formulation of the maxwell equations based on the antisymmetric tensor

24

f  . the gauge transformation of the vector potential a(x) = a(x) is given
as usual according to

a(x) 7 a(x) = a(x) +

1
e(x) ,

(124)

where (x) is a scalar eld. from the electromagnetic elds e and b one knows
that they are invariant under this transformation. comparing with eq. (121) one
observes that it is only the eld c(x) which is required to be invariant. since
this term is supposed to be zero and the gauge condition should not be modied
by the gauge transformation the scalar eld has to full the relation

p p (x) = 0 .

(125)

therefore, gauge invariance is achieved in the present formalism by restricting
on a certain class of gauge functions (x).

10. photon plane wave states

in this section a plane wave expansion for free photon elds will be derived,
where the techniques developed for massless fermions will be applied. the trans-
formation properties of the vector components a(x) can be understood in terms
of 4  4 transformation matrices acting on four-component vectors

x  7 x  = (l)
l = exp (i(j   + k  )) .

now, one can use essentially the results of section 8. the standard frame is again
given as the system in which the momentum is directed along the polarization
axis. the pauli-lubanski vector in the standard frame is given by eq. (109),
where the generators now have to be replaced by the generators of eq. (126).
one can construct two eigenstates |i of j 3 with the eigenvalues  = 1

|i = e

  =  e

1  ie
22

 .

(128)

25

these vectors are eigenstates of j 3, i.e. (j 3)
2 are unit
vectors along the x- and y-axis. in the standard frame the eigenstates satisfy the
relation

(129)

the basis vectors of the irreducible representation are dened according to eq. (43)
and boosted perpendicular to the polarization axis to the system, where the state
is described by the momentum p

d(b)|  pt i = ((b)

e
)  | bptb i .

(130)

introducing the abbreviation e(p, ) = (b)

 the polarization vectors are

|p3|(p0 + |p3|)(cid:19) ,

(131)

where p = (p1  ip2)/2. the transformation rules for the plane wave states

are

d(t )| e(p, ) p i = e(p, )  exp (ipa)| p i .

 e(p, ))  |lp l i ,

(132)

the plane wave states can be written in the notation

| +  p i = | e(p, ) p i ,

|   p i = | e(p, ) p i .

(133)

the spin operator s3 is dened as in eq. (115) with the appropriate generators for
j i and k i. the dening relations for the states are formal identical to eq. (117)
except the dierent eigenvalues for the polarization. for photons one nds  =
1.
a(x) =x z dp (h x | +  p ih +  p | ai + h x |   p ih  p | ai)

the plane wave expansion for the free photon eld is given by

(134)

d3p

=x z

(2)32p0 (cid:0)e(p, )eipxa(p, ) + e (p, )eipx a(p, )(cid:1)  .

the components of the electromagnetic elds can be obtained from a(x) =
a(x). since the solution of the quantum wave equation is expanded in terms
of the physical photon states, which are dened by the representations of the
poincare group, the lorentz gauge condition is satised. therefore, the c(x)
contributions discussed in the last section vanish and the original form of the
maxwell equations is restored.

26

11. interactions

as well as in the dirac theory the lagrange function of the new formalism
should be invariant under local gauge transformations. this has the consequence
that a gauge eld, which is identied with the photon eld, has to be introduced
by a substitution of the momentum operators. the free theory then changes into
a theory which couples the electron and photon elds in the interaction terms of
the lagrangian.

the gauge eld is introduced by replacing the momentum operators according

to

p  7 p   ea(x) ,

(135)

where the charge e < 0 corresponds to the negative charge of the electron. this
minimal substitution of the momentum operators in the lagrangian of eq. (79)
is leading to

l(x) = (x)(p  ea(x))( p  e a(x))(x)

m2 (x)(x) +

1
2

t r(cid:0) a(x)p p a(x)(cid:1) ,

(136)

where an additional term for the photon eld has been added to the lagrangian.
the lagrangian (136) is comparable to the qed lagrangian for scalar particles
since a seagull term appears which is not present in the dirac theory. if the gauge
eld transforms according to eq. (124), and eq. (125) is satised, this lagrangian
is invariant under a local gauge transformation of the form

(x) 7 (x) = ei(x)(x) .

(137)

starting from the above lagrangian the equation of motion for the fermion eld
can be calculated using eq. (84)

(p  ea(x))( p  e a(x))(x) = m2(x) .

(138)

for the calculation one should separate the basis matrices from the vector compo-
nents. the -terms, which are included in the lagrangian, are given explicitly
in eqs. (39) and (40).

in the same way the equation of motion for the photons can be derived with

the lagrange equation

l
a  

l

( a)

= 0 .

(139)

this lagrange equation has been simply adopted from the maxwell theory. as
well as in the description of the electron eld the spin matrices are considered as

27

basis vectors which have no further eect on the dynamical variables. using the
above equation a straightforward calculation is leading to

p p a(x) = j(x) .

(140)

the current j(x) = j (x) includes the photon eld and the spin matrices 
between the spinor functions. using eq. (39) one can separate the current into a
spin dependent and a spin independent contribution

j (x) = i (x) + k (x),

(141)

where the contribution i (x) is identical to the electromagnetic current for scalar
particles except that two-component spinor functions are used

i (x) = e (x)(

p   ea(x))(x) + e (x)(




p  + ea(x))(x) .

(142)

the spin dependent part can be expressed with the spin operators  , which are
related to the generators of the covering group of so(3, 1) according to eq. (41)



k (x) = ie (x)(
it is the current given in eq. (141) which is conserved when the electromagnetic
eld is present.

p  ea(x))(x) + ie (x) (


p + ea (x))(x) . (143)

comparing eq. (140) with the maxwell equations (121) one nds, assuming
c(x) = 0, that the inhomogeneous terms are given in the correct form. eqs. (138)
and (140) are the new equations of motion of quantum electrodynamics. these
equations are very complicated coupled dierential equations and they can be
solved only in a suitable approximation scheme. to show that these equations
provide a reasonable basis for calculating electromagnetic processes, the connec-
tion of the electron wave equation (138) with the dirac equation will be outlined
in the following.

12. quantum wave equation and dirac equation

the dirac theory is able to explain experimental data with highest accuracy.
the quantum wave equation should therefore be in agreement with the dirac
equation. one can show that in the case of electromagnetical interactions the
dierential operator of the quantum wave equation is equivalent to the quadratic
form of the dirac dierential operator, from which one knows that the energy
spectrum of hydrogen like systems is exactly the same as for the dirac equation
[17, 18].

to show this relationship, the quantum wave equation (138) will be considered

in detail. a short calculation is leading to

(cid:0)(p 0  ea0)2  (p  ea)2  j[p 0  ea0, p  ea]  m2(cid:1) (x) = 0 ,

28

(144)

where the mass term is now on the left side of the equation. the second term of
the equation still includes the pauli matrices. one can evaluate this expression
according to

(p  ea)2 = (p  ea)  (p  ea)  eb ,

(145)

where one should compare the notation with eq. (25). b corresponds to the
magnetic eld given in eq. (120). the commutator, which is proportional to the
hyperbolic unit, can be calculated according to

with the electric eld e. inserting these results into eq. (144) gives

[p 0  ea0, p  ea] = iee ,

(146)

(147)

(148)

(cid:0)(p  ea)(p  ea)  eei iji + ebii  m2(cid:1) (x) = 0 .

here, the pauli matrices i are written explicitly for a better comparision with the
dirac equation. it is possible to express eq. (147) completely in the relativistic
tensor formalism if pauli matrices and electromagnetic elds are expressed with
the antisymmetric tensor  given in eq. (40) and f  = a  a

(cid:16)(p  ea)(p  ea) 

 f   m2(cid:17) (x) = 0 .

this equation is formal identical to the quadratic form of the dirac equation
[17], which can be derived with the dirac formalism. the dirac equation is given
by

(p   ea(x)  m)(x) = 0

(149)

with the dirac matrices . the quadratic form can be found if one multiplies
the dirac equation by the operator p   ea(x) + m. this yields
((p   ea)2  m2)(x) =
 [p   ea, p   ea]  m2)(x) =

((p  ea)(p  ea) 

i

((p  ea)(p  ea) 

 f   m2)(x) = 0 .

(150)

e

the two wave equations of eqs. (148) and (150) have the same form. how-
ever, there are two dierences: the rst dierence is given in the structure of
the spinors (x).
in the case of the quantum wave equation (x) has a two-
component structure, whereas in the dirac equation (x) corresponds to a four-
component spinor

quantum wave equation : (x) = (x) + j(x) ,

dirac equation : (x) =(cid:18) (x)

(x) (cid:19) .

29

(151)

the other dierence is the spin tensor .
in the dirac theory this term is
dened according to  = i/2 [, ]. with this tensor one is able to express
eq. (150) according to

(cid:0)(p  ea)(p  ea)  eeiii + ebii  m2(cid:1) (x) = 0 .

comparing this equation with eq. (147) one observes that in both cases the
term including the electric eld is the only term which couples the upper and the
lower component of the spinor. in the quantum wave equation the coupling term
is proportional to ji, in the quadratic dirac equation the term corresponds to
i = 0i = 5i. one can show, using the dirac representation of 5, that j and
5 have the same eect on the spinor, an interchange between upper and lower
components

(152)

quantum wave equation :

j (x ) = (x) + j(x) ,

(153)

dirac equation : 5(x) =(cid:18) 0 1

1 0 (cid:19)(cid:18) (x)

(x) (cid:19) =(cid:18) (x)

(x) (cid:19) .

one therefore nds in both cases the same two coupled dierential equations. in
the quantum wave equation the terms proportional to the hyperbolic unit be-
long to one dierential equation, the other terms to the second equation. in the
quadratic dirac equation the dierential equations are separated by the compo-
nent structure.

13. summary and conclusions

in this work a new formulation of quantum electrodynamics was presented.
the motivation for the investigation was the assumption that fundamental free
quantum elds should be described by a unied dierential operator, which does
not depend on any particle properties. in the case of electrons and photons it
was shown that, concerning the spin structure, this unication is possible. the
wave equation constructed with this dierential operator has been denoted by
quantum wave equation. it is leading to the same coupled dierential equations
for electrons as the quadratic form of the dirac equation. furthermore, the
quantum wave equation for photons is equivalent to the four maxwell equations.
these results can be obtained if the basis vectors of the relativistic vector co-
ordinates are represented by a relativistic matrix algebra which includes the unit
matrix and the pauli matrices multiplicated by the hyperbolic unit. relativistic
vectors based on this matrix algebra were investigated. their behaviour under
lorentz transformations was studied and a relativistic spin group was constructed
in analogy to the non-relativistic treatment. the quantum wave equation for pho-
tons shows that vector elds appear in combination with the same matrix algebra.

30

therefore, it seems to be a general property of quantum physics that vector co-
ordinates have to be considered together with the corresponding algebra for the
basis vectors.

it was shown that the dierential operator of the quantum wave equation
transforms like a spin operator. however, for a non-interacting system the spin
structure of the dierential operator is not important and the operator is reduced
to the mass operator of the poincare group. therefore, the properties of the free
electron eld have been investigated within this group and the plane wave rep-
resentation was generated explicitly. it was shown that a boosted pauli matrix
can be related to the pauli-lubanski vector. this oers the possibility to dene
the spin in analogy to the non-relativistic treatment. former problems in the
second quantization of anticommuting klein-gordon elds disappear if the nega-
tive energy contribution is multiplicated by the hyperbolic unit. a free massless
charged fermion eld has been investigated, where the plane wave expansion of
the eld can be constructed in analogy to the massive electron eld.

the quantum wave equation for photons is leading to the maxwell equations
including two additional terms. these terms vanish in the lorentz gauge. a plane
wave expansion for the photon eld was derived, which removes the additional
terms and stays in close analogy to the description of the electrons.

though the spin structure is not important in a non-interacting system, the
inclusion of interactions requires the given form of the quantum wave equation.
a new lagrange function of quantum electrodynamics can be constructed using
the concept of minimal substitution. the equations of motion for the electron
and photon elds were derived and the relation of the electron equation to the
quadratic form of the dirac equation was shown. the equation of motion for
the photons is equivalent to the inhomogeneous maxwell equations. since the
new formalism can be related with the dirac and the maxwell equations one can
expect that explicit calculations of observables will lead to results which should
be close to the results of the conventional formalism.
