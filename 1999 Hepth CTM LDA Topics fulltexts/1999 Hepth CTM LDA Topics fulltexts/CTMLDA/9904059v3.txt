abstract

characters and linear combinations of characters that admit a fermionic sum
representation as well as a factorized form are considered for some minimal
virasoro models. as a consequence, various rogers-ramanujan type identities
are obtained. dilogarithm identities producing corresponding eective central
charges and secondary eective central charges are derived. several ways of
constructing more general fermionic representations are discussed.

1 introduction
a minimal virasoro model [1] m(s, t) is parameterized by two positive integers s and t such
that hs, ti = 1 (i.e. they are co-prime numbers). it has the central charge c(s, t) = 1 6(st)2
.
n,m = (ntms)2(st)2
the characters of its irreducible representations with highest weights hs,t
are given by [2]

4st

where 1ns1, 1mt1, s,t
possess the following symmetries

n,m := hs,t

k=1(1qk). the characters

xk=

qstk2(cid:16)qk(ntms)  qk(nt+ms)+nm(cid:17) ,
n,m  c(s,t)

24 and (q)m :=qm
sn,tm(q) = t,s

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

tm,sn(q) .
in addition, (1.1) allows us to relate some characters of dierent models

s,t
n,m(q) = t,s

m,n(q) = s,t

s,t
n,m(q) = s,t

n,m(q) ,

where  is a positive number such that hs, ti = ht, si = 1. for instance, 5,6
3,10
1,2m(q), m = 1, 2. below we will also use the identity proven in [3]:

m,2(q) =

3n,2t
n,t2m(q)  3n,2t

n,t+2m(q) = 6n,t

n,m(q)  6n,t

n,tm(q) ,

where m < t/2 and ht, 6i = hn, 2i = ht, ni = 1.

in some cases characters (1.1) admit the form named fermionic representation

(q) = qconst x~m=~0

q ~m ta ~m+ ~m ~b
(q)m1 . . . (q)mr

.

(1.4)

(1.5)

hitherto examples of such representation were obtained for two large classes of characters.
for a being related to the inverse cartan matrix for some lie algebra they were studied in
[4]. in this case certain restrictions are often imposed on the summation over ~m. examples
of (1.5) for a = 0 or, at most, being a diagonal matrix (and (q)mi being replaced with
(qb)mi, b > 0) were obtained in [3, 5] as consequences of representation of characters in the
factorized form

(q) = qconst

mym=1(cid:16){xm}+
y(cid:17)+

m

nyn=1(cid:16){xn}y(cid:17)

n

,

(1.6)

where the multiplicities i are integer. here and below we use the notations of [3]

{x}y :=

yk=0(cid:16)1  qx+ky(cid:17) ,

0 < x < y ;

{x1; . . . ; xn}y :=

nya=1{xa}y .

(1.7)

equivalence of fermionic and factorized forms for characters which admit both types of rep-
resentation gives rise to non-trivial identities. we will refer to them as to rogers-ramanujan
type identities.

the paper is organized as follows. section 2 contains fermionic sum representations for
certain families of characters and linear combinations of characters for m(3, t). these results
are extensions of some previously known examples. here are also given several fermionic
sum representations for m(4, 5), m(5, 6) and m(6, 7) that seem to be new. in section 3

1

we observe that all the considered (combinations of) characters admit also the factorized
form (1.6) and present the corresponding rogers-ramanujan type identities. in section 4
we apply the saddle point analysis to the fermionic representations given in section 2 and
derive bethe ansatz type equations that yield the corresponding eective central charge
or (for the dierences of characters) the secondary eective central charge as a sum of
dilogarithms. for the latter case we show how to modify the saddle point analysis if we are
dealing with fermionic sum with alternated signs in summation. we solve the bethe ansatz
type equations explicitly and obtain four innite dilogarithm sum rules corresponding to
m(3, t) and one non-trivial identity for m(4, 5). in section 5 we employ certain identities
for virasoro characters and expand the list of fermionic representations for m(4, 5), m(5, 6)
and m(6, 7). section 6 contains a brief discussion and conclusion.
2 fermionic representations for m(3, t), m(4, 5) m(5, 6) and m(6, 7).
it was observed in [4] that the characters 3,3k+1
characters of m(3, 5) admit the fermionic form (1.5) with ak and ak given by

(q) as well as all the four

(q) and 3,3k+2

although formal derivation of (2.4)-(2.5) and (2.8)-(2.9) is beyond the scope of the present
paper, i have veried these identities using mathematica for k  7, t  5 expanding them
typically up to q100. a rigorous proof can presumably be achieved with the help of the
machinery of bailey pairs (see e.g. [6]). in contrast to a generic fermionic representation,
eqs. (2.4) and (2.5) do not have restrictions on the summation. however, if we combine them
to obtain an expression for a single character, the summation over mk will be restricted to
either odd or even numbers. in particular, eq. (2.4) in the case of k = 1, n = 2 gives two
expressions for 3,4
1,2(q) (as noted also in [4]). moreover, eq. (2.8) yields one more expression
for the same character and hence we get

while (2.4) and (2.5) extend previously known examples, the following fermionic repre-
sentations for m(4, 5), m(5, 6) and m(6, 7) to my knowledge have not been discussed in
the literature so far:

(2.16)

m(5, 6): another fermionic representation for the characters of the m(5, 6) model can be
obtained if we notice that eqs. (1.3) and (1.4) allow us to relate these characters to those
of the m(3, 10) model: 5,6
n,5(q) =
1,52n(q)  3,10
3,10
1,5+2n(q), n = 1, 2. combining these relations with formulae (2.4) for k = 3,

(2.1) which is the inverse cartan matrix of the tadpole graph with (k1) nodes. this gives
us yet another fermionic representation for m(5, 6) with a being 66 matrix.

(2.23)

furthermore, due to eq. (1.3) we can identify 6,7
1,3n(q), n = 1, 2, 3. therefore,
these three characters of m(6, 7) admit fermionic form of the type (2.20) with a being 99
matrix.

3 rogers-ramanujan type identities.

in the previous section we considered some characters and combinations of characters which
possess fermionic representations. it turns out that all of them have another common feature
 they are factorizable, that is they admit also the form (1.6). for the characters of the
m(2, 2k + 1) models this is the well-known representation

where we use the notations (1.7). equality of the r.h.s. of eqs. (3.1) and (2.20) yields a family
of identities known as the andrews-gordon identities [7]. for k = 2 these are the famous
rogers-ramanujan identities [10]

combining the fermionic representations given in the previous section with these factorized
representations, we obtain various identities of the sumproduct type. they can be re-
garded as generalizations of the rogers-ramanujan identities and it seems that many of
them (especially those with a multivariable summation) have not appeared in the literature
so far.

belong both to (3.3) and (3.4). namely, we obtain for t = 1, 2, 3 . . .

(3.20)

to complete the discussion of the m(3, t) case, we recall that since each of eqs. (2.4)-(2.5)
comprises two equalities, we can express the involved characters as sums without alternation
of the sign but with summation over mk restricted to odd or even numbers. then, according
to (3.4), each character obtained in this way admits also the product representation. thus,
we get for t = 3k+1, 1nk+1

4 dilogarithm identities.

xn

if a q-series (q) (not necessarily identied in terms of characters) admits both fermionic
representation (1.5) and product representation (1.6),
it implies not only existence of a
rogers-ramanujan type identity but also leads to a certain identity involving the dilogarithm
function, l(x) =pn=1
2 ln x ln(1 x). indeed, the product side allows us to nd easily
the number ce that governs the asymptotics of (q) in the q  1 limit (see e.g. [3, 5]). on
the other hand, the same number can be obtained from the fermionic sum by the saddle point
analysis (see e.g. [4, 9]). equivalence of the two expressions for ce is typically a nontrivial
identity. of course, if it is known a-priory that (q) is a character, then its fermionic
form alone leads to a dilogarithm identity since ce (eective central charge) is xed by the
properties of (q) with respect to the modular transformations. namely, let q = e2i and
q = e2i/ , then for the minimal virasoro model m(s, t) we have s,t
q  1, where

(4.3)

where bi are some positive numbers. modifying properly the standard saddle point analysis
of a fermionic sum (see [4, 9] for the case bi = 1 and [5] for bi = b 6= 1), we nd that (4.3)
has the asymptotics q

(q) = qconstx~m

eq. (4.9) is a particular case of (4.3) with b1 = . . . = br1 = br = 1 and thus we can apply
eqs. (4.4)-(4.5). we conclude that (4.7) has the asymptotics q c

generalization of (4.11)-(4.14) for the case of a fermionic sum involving alternated sum-
mation over several variables is obvious. now let us list dilogarithm identities that follow
from the formulae (4.6), (4.13) and (4.1)-(4.2) for the (combinations of) characters considered
in the previous sections.

ak allow us to compute the corresponding matrices ik and ik

these generalized incidence matrices dier from those of the lie algebra ak only by a few
entries in the lower-right corner. this hints on a possibility to solve the corresponding sets
of equations (4.6) in a uniform manner, similar to that known for the m(2, t) models [9, 16].
indeed, we nd the following solutions of (4.6) (they can be veried by a straightforward
substitution):

let us remark that although these identities were derived here exploiting the modular prop-
erties of characters and the saddle point analysis, they resemble the general a1-type dilog-
arithm identities [15] and probably can be proved in more direct way based on the func-
tional relations for the dilogarithm. for instance, eq. (4.20) for k = 2 yields the equality

9

8 .

(l(1  12
it can be proved with the help of the abel duplication
formula [14, 15]. it should be mentioned that eq. (4.19) for k odd was encountered in [17] in
the context of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz.

next we consider the dierences of characters in (2.4)-(2.5). first, we compute the

matrices ik and ik. it turns out that for m(3, 3k + 1) det(bak) = 0 that is ik does not exist
and we have to solve the equations (4.12). for m(3, 3k + 2) the matrix ik exists and is given
by

( ik)ij = i,j+1 + i+1,j + i,kj,k1  3i,k1j,k + 2i,k1j,k1  2i,kj,k .

we obtain the following solution of (4.12) for m(3, 3k + 1) (written in terms of i = 1/yi

(4.21)

for the sake of uniformness)

i =

sin (2i+2)

(4.26)

although the summation in the fermionic representation (2.13) is not alternated, we can
nevertheless introduce matrix a according to (4.10) and solve eqs. (4.11)-(4.12). the solution
is y1 = 1  , y2 =  and thus we get c = 6
5 . this identity is rather
trivial mathematically (since it is well known that l() = 2
15 ) but it is
remarkable that the value of c is in agreement with (4.2).

yields x1 = x2 = 1   and gives the correct central charge: ce = 6

our example (2.14) corresponding to  = 1
3 is known [4]. however, matrix
a constructed from (4.27) according to (4.10) leads to the correct value of c only for  = 1
2 .
namely, in this case we get y1 = , y2 = 1   and c = 6
it
would be interesting to see if there are fermionic representations for characters of m(5, 6)
corresponding to other values of . below we will show that  = 0 appears not in m(5, 6)
but in closely related m(3, 10) model.

5 further fermionic representations and identities.

so far we considered only irreducible fermionic representations of characters, i.e. those that
are not decomposable into a product of other fermionic sums. however, there are many ways
to construct reducible fermionic representations. one of them was discussed in [3, 5] and
based on the fact that any factorizable character can be brought to the form (4.3) (typically
with bi 6= 1) with the help of the following formulae

{x}y =

xm=0

(1)mq

y

2 (m2m)+mx
(qy)m

,

1
{x}y

=

xm=0

(1)mqmx

(qy)m

.

(5.1)

another possibility is to use relations expressing a character as a product of other char-
acters for which fermionic representation is known. to derive and prove such relations it is
often convenient to exploit the factorized forms of characters. for instance, with the help
of (3.3), (3.4) and (3.6) it is straightforward to check the following identities (see [3] for a
similar derivation)

n,m (q)3n,10m
2n,3m
2n,3m

n,m (q)(cid:16)3n,10m

n,m (q) 2n,5m

n,5m (q) = 2n,5m
n,m(2k1)(q) + 3n,10m
choosing here n = m = 1 (recall that 2,3
ramanujan identities (3.2), we obtain the following formulae

n,m(112k)(q)(cid:17) = 2n,5m

n,2m (q) ,

n,mk (q) 2n,5m

n,mk (q) ,

(5.2)

k = 1, 2 . (5.3)

1,1(q) = 1) and using the sum side of the rogers-

where k = 1, 2. these reducible fermionic representations correspond to the choice  = 0 for
the matrix a given by (4.27).

using in the similar way the following identities for k = 1, 2 (they were found in [18] and

generalized to the form similar to (5.2)-(5.3) in [3])

2,k(q) = 3,4
4,5

(5.6)

(5.7)

and employing any of the fermionic representations for m(3, 4) and m(5, 6) discussed above,
we get dierent reducible fermionic representations for m(4, 5). for instance, substituting
(2.11) and (2.16) into (5.6) we obtain

2,k(q) = q4,5

k = 1, 2 .

(5.8)

one more possibility to extend the list of fermionic representations is to consider relations

between characters with rescaled argument q. for instance, we have [3]

5,6
n,2(q) + 5,6

n,4(q) = 2,5

1,n(q

1
2 ) ,

5,6
n,1(q)  5,6

n,5(q) = 2,5

1,3n(q2) , n = 1, 2 .

(5.9)

11

together with (3.2) this gives yet another fermionic representation for m(5, 6)

n,5(q) =

(q2)m

xm=0

. (5.10)

on the other hand, reading eqs. (5.9) from the right to the left and using (2.15)-(2.16), we
obtain alternative sum sides for the rogers-ramanujan identities (3.2):

xm=0

qm2+(2n)m

where n = 1, 2. this sequence of identities can be continued further employing the fermionic
representations (2.17)-(2.18) and also those found in [4] (corresponding to (4.27) with  = 1
3 ).

(5.12)

where d1 = 3, d2 = 1, d3 = 2, together with eqs. (2.21)-(2.22) can be used to get fermionic
representations of the type (4.3) for the m(6, 7) model.
it is also possible to combine rescaling of q and constructing of reducible fermionic sums.
for example, let p be a prime number such that hp, ti = 1. then, using (1.1), it is easy to
derive the following relation

3,2p
1,p (q) s,t

n,m(qp) = ps,t

pn,m(q) .

(5.13)

1,p (q) should be replaced with 2,9

here 3,2p
1,3(q) if p = 3. if p is not a prime number, general-
ization of (5.13) can be achieved by decomposing p into proper factors. now choosing p = 2,
t = 5 and s = 2 or s = 3 in (5.13), we get for k = 1, 2

2,k(q) = 2,5
4,5

1,k(q2)3,4

6 discussion.

having a character (linear combination of characters) in the fermionic form (4.3), we can

into parts of a specic form. the interpretation of the pia
a as momenta of massless particles
gives rise to the quasi-particle picture, where a character is regarded as a partition function,

rewrite it as a series (q) =pk=0 kqk, where the level k admits partitioning, k =pr
a=1pia pia
(q) =pk keek. here q = e2v/l, with v being the speed of sound, and l  the size of
the system. this quasi-particle representation was developed originally in [4] (for bi = 1) and
became a standard technique by now. it is also applicable to factorized characters [3, 5, 19]
(in this case bi 6= 1).

a ,

for the fermionic form (1.5) or (4.3) of a character the quasi-particle representation in-
volves r quasi-particles. they are naturally interpreted as a conformal limit of particles
presented in a massive theory related to the given conformal model. moreover, it was sug-
gested in [20] that dierent non-equivalent fermionic representations of the same character
correspond to dierent integrable perturbations of the conformal model in question.
it
would be interesting to understand if the representations for m(4, 5), m(5, 6) and m(6, 7)
discussed above in section 2 agree with this picture. our results demonstrate that the num-
ber of non-equivalent fermionic representations for m(s, t) increases if st can be represented
as a product of two other co-prime numbers. for instance, we have encountered above three
representations of the type (1.5) for m(5, 6) besides the one considered in [4]. furthermore,
we can considerably expand the list of non-equivalent fermionic representations, if we are
looking for representations of the type (4.3), including those that are reducible. for instance,
in this way one obtains representations with one (5.10) and two quasi-particles (5.16) for
m(5, 6) (another two-particle representation of the type (4.3) follows from the factorized
characters [3, 19]).
to summarize, in the present paper we have extended the list of fermionic representations
for some minimal virasoro models. physical content of these representations, in particular,
their connection with massive integrable models remains to be investigated. for all con-
sidered fermionic representations we have established rogers-ramanujan type identities and
the corresponding dilogarithm identities. the rogers-ramanujan type identities possibly can
be employed to construct various quasi-particle representations for certain physical entities
arising in the lattice models of statistical mechanics.

after submission of this manuscript i was informed by the referee that connection of the

matrix (2.12) to the m(4, 5) model was found earlier by m. terhoeven (unpublished).
