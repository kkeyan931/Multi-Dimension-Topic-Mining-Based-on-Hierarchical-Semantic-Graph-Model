(3.4) large n limit (3.4) nothing but, area-preserving dieomorphism algebra usual torus, sdi(t 2), identied su() {$9711162$}. rather simple justication matrix model m2-brane dynamics correspondence {$9711162$}. general rational , one check = q n , (3.4) holds mi, ni dened mod qn represents subgroup su() {$9711162$}. irrational case, however situation little dierent, case (3.3) mapped subgroup su(). indeed (3.3) thought generalization sdi(t 2) nct, sdi(t 2 ). usual geometric language, sdi(t 2) set dieomorphisms keeping kahler structure torus unchanged, = iv , v volume torus. general case know kahler structure real part: = iv + b, recently discussed {$9711162$}, least zero volume limit, b string theory language background b-eld ux, identied deformation parameter 7 torus, . one show transformations generated (3.3) algebra invariant. fact supports arguments {$9810072$} u-duality group string brane theory non-zero b-eld. furthermore, (3.3) irrational treated area-preserving dieomorphism algebra nct, sdi(t gauge theory action now, imply (3.1) writing action (2.18) momentum space terms l~k fourrier modes. perform calculations non-supersymmetric action, gen- 2). eralization supersymmetric case, obtained (2.20), like usual gauge theories, thus quote results. plugging (3.1) (2.17), f = x~k ik(k)l~k + 2i x~m,~n sin( ~m ~n)a(m)a(n)l ~m+~n (3.5) hence action u(1) ncym, (2.18), fourrier modes is: = 1 g2 p~k(k(k))(k(k))+ 2p ~m,~n,~k k(k) sin( ~m ~n)a(m)a(n)( ~m + ~n + ~k)+ (3.6) 4p ~m,~n,~k,~l sin( ~m ~n) sin(~k ~l)a(m)a(n)a(k)a(l)( ~m + ~n + ~k + ~l). writing action implied reality condition elds, a(k) = (k). action form usual gauge theories group indices identied momentum, structure constants f ~m,~n,~k f ~m,~n,~k = 2 sin( ~m ~n)( ~m + ~n + ~k) (3.7) see momentum conservation condition automatically taken account structure constants. important feature gauge theory gauge invariance, (2.19), enables us handle problem renormalizability without caring non-locality theory. noting (3.7) action (3.6), see gauge theory momentum dependent coupling sin( ~m ~n), smaller one, hence hope usual perturbative eld theory methods, despite momentum dependence couplings, work here. another point mention broken lorentz invariance (2+1) dimensional space. seen action couplings function spatial momentum 8 only, explicitly breaks lorentz invariance. gauge xing condition removes subtleties related lack lorentz invariance. show later that, lorentz non-invariance due special form interactions destroy perturbative calculations consistent gauge invariance least, one loop. moreover nd ward identity gauge theory. going details loop calculations, let us study structure algebra dened (3.3) related gauge theory, ncym: a) l ~m parallel ~m commuting. b) generator commutes others l~0, rank group one related cartan sub-algebra u(1). c) usual non-abelian gauge theories, gauge particles charged cartan sub-algebra, case since cartan u(1), gauge particles dipoles sub-algebra {$9711162$}, corresponding dipole moments proportional momentum always normal parallel dipoles non-interacting. d) momentum conserved vertex, dipole moment conservation. e) string theory point view {$9711162$}, dipoles lowest modes strings attached d2-brane b-eld background. f) high energy dipole-dipole scattering suppressed moyal bracket structure. perturbative tools calculations need read propagators interaction vertices action (3.6). details refer reader {$9711165$}. 9 4 loop calculations renormalization section, order discuss renormalizability, -function behaviour theory uv ir limits, explicitly calculate one loop diagrams ncym. simplicity, take continuum limit instead summation use integrals. theory supposed well-dened continuum limit {$9711162$}. loop calculations 1) dipoles self energy part: gets contributions four diagrams, dipole-loop, dipoles tadpole-loop, ghost-loop counter-term {$9711165$}. 1-1) dipole-loop: (k) = 1 2 z d3q (2)3 1 q2(q + k)2 a(2 sin(~k ~q))2, (4.1) = (q2 + (q + k)2 + 4k2)g + 6qq + 3(qk + q k) 3kk. (4.2) worth noting that, case ncym theories, unlike usual loop calculations, since theory lorentz invariant, use wick rotation method. perform loop integrals, since q0 dependence vertex functions, rst integrate q0 component taking residue q0 poles. remaining integrals form: (k) = 4 2 z qdqd (2)3  sin(kq sin )2, (4.3) performing integration , note sin2(kq sin ) = 1 2 1 2 cos(2kq sin ). cosine part expanded terms bessel functions {$9711162$}. straightforward, messy calculation show terms containing bessel functions nite, divergent part comes 1 2 term sine squared. so, nd divergent part integral enough substitute sine squared (4.1) 1 2. words, divergent part (4.1) exactly form usual su(n) ym theory c2(g) = 4 1 2. furthermore, divergent part (4.1) lorentz invariant calculated wick rotation. 1-2) dipole tadpole- ghost- loops: using method explained earlier, i.e. integrating q0 component expanding sine 10 squared terms bessel functions, one show divergent part diagrams, like dipole-loop case gets contributions putting sine squared equal 1 2 , restores lorentz invariance theory. altogether dipole self energy part, renormalized like usual local gauge theory, c2(g) = 2. important result although interactions introduced ncym theory lorentz invariant, lorentz invariance remains propagators one loop. 2) ghost self energy part: two diagrams contributing here, ghost-dipole loop counter-term. integrals appearing ghost-dipole loop, similar ghost-loop contributions dis- cussed above, hence argument holds true divergent part obtained usual su(n) gauge theory c2(g) = 2. important result obtain generalized ward identity, k = 0. 3) dipole-ghost vertex: three diagrams contributing here, diagram two-ghosts loop, diagram one ghost loop counter-term. performing calculations method explained above, long straight-forward calculus, nd divergent part loops described usual gauge theory result c2(g) = 2. three four dipole vertices results obtained. see explicit loop calculations divergent part ncym theory one loop, governed divergent part loops usual gauge theory. hence divergent parts behave like local eld theory. however nite contributions one loop level non-local. terms also break lorentz invariance. appearance terms suggests possibility non-local divergent terms higher loops {$9711162$}. but, according calculations {$9711165$}, due bessel functions, contribution non-local terms two loop suppressed. remind that, calculations assumed structure constant, 2 sin( ~m ~n), non-zero. so, although result independent, arguments valid = 0 case 3. 3 rational case always one nd basis torus structure constant zero. 11 5 uv ir behaviour noncommutative gauge theories explicit loop calculations, shown previous section ncym theory one loop renormalizable. want discuss uv ir limits detail. since consider theory torus, however large volume limit, p, momentum, discrete need address p 0 behaviour. according results, although theory non-local hence usual renormal- ization group arguments valid, one loop -function ncym negative, asymptotically free. moreover large volume limit, uv disentangles ir {$9711162$}. uv limit, besides formal arguments {$9711162$} explicit calculations show that, deal non-local theory. uv, although theory scale invariant, admits xed point. supersymmetric case, ncsym, realized d2-brane b-eld background {$9711162$} 0, low energy dynamics, like usual d-brane arguments, decouples bulk. collective coordinates d2-brane, living commuting space, form single vector multiplet. 7 scalars correspond 7 transverse direction brane. dual vector multiplet, scalar corresponds position brane eleventh dimension {$9711165$}. hence moduli space u(1) ncsym theory r7 s1. coupling (2+1) dimensional gauge theory given circumference s1 factor. besides transverse coordinates, since interested gauge theories nct, moduli coming compact space noncommutative structure tours. string theory limit, moduli t-duality group acting mc = sl(2)n so(2) sl(2)c so(2) .
