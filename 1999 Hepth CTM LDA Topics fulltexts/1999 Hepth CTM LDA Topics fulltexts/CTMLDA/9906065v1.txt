abstract

we dene a special matrix multiplication among a special subset of 2n  2n matrices, and
study the resulting (non-associative) algebras and their subalgebras. we derive the conditions
under which these algebras become alternative non-associative and when they become associa-
tive. in particular, these algebras yield special matrix representations of octonions and complex
numbers; they naturally lead to the cayley-dickson doubling process. our matrix represen-
tation of octonions also yields elegant insights into diracs equation for a free particle. a few
other results and remarks arise as byproducts.

i. introduction

complex numbers and functions have played a pivotal role in physics for three centuries. on the
other hand, their generalization to other hurwitz algebras does not seem to have red the interest
of physicists to the same extent, because there is still no compelling application of them. thus,
despite the fascination of quaternions and octonions for over a century, it is fair to say that they
still await universal acceptance. this is not to say that there have not been valiant attempts to
nd appropriate uses for them. one can point to their possible impact on

 quantum mechanics and hilbert space [1]
 relativity and the conformal group [2]
 field theory and functional integrals [3]
 internal symmetries in particle physics [4]
 colour eld theories [5]
 formulations of wave equations [6]

in all these cases, there is nothing that stands out and commands our attention; rather, the attempts
to describe relativistic physics in terms of quaternions and octonions look rather contrived if not
forced, especially for the case of octonions. in this paper we describe a generalization of octonions
that allows for lie algebras beyond the obvious su(2) structure that is connected with quaternions.
we do not presume that they will lead to new physics, but we do think they will at least provide
a new avenue for investigation.

since octonions are not associative, they cannot be represented by matrices with the usual
multiplication rules. in this note, we give representations of octonions and other non-associative
algebras by special matrices, which are endowed with very special multiplication rules; these rules

can be regarded as an adaptation and generalization of zorns multiplication rule [7]. these matrix
representations suggest generalizations of octonions to other non-associative algebras, which in turn
lead one almost automatically to a construction of new algebras from old ones, with double the
number of elements; we have called these double algebras. closer inspection reveals that our
procedure can be made to correspond to the cayley-dickson construction method [8], except that
in our case the procedure seems rather natural, once one accepts the multiplication rule, whereas
the cayley-dickson rule looks ad hoc at rst sight.

ii. denitions, notations and a review of the octonion algebra o
the cayley or the octonion algebra o is an 8-dimensional non-associative algebra, which is dened
in terms of the basis elements e ( = 0, 1, 2, , 7) and their multiplication table. e0 stands for
the unit element. we can eciently summarize the table by introducing the following notation [in
general, we shall use greek indices (, , . . .) to include the 0 and latin indices (i, j, k, . . .) when we
exclude the 0]:

the multiplication rules among the basis elements of octonions e can be expressed in the form:

ek  e4+k ,

for k = 1, 2, 3 .

(1)

 e4ei = eie4 = ei ,

e4ei = eie4 = ei ,

eiej = ij e0 + ijkek ,
eiej = ij e0  ijkek ,
ejei = eiej = ij e4  ijkek .

e4e4 = e0 ,

(i, j, k = 1, 2, 3)

we can formally summarize the rules above by

e e = g e0 +

7xk=1

k
 ek ,

g := diag (1,1, ,1) ,

ij = k
k
ji ,

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

where ,  = 0, 1, , 7 , and i, j, k = 1, , 7 . the multiplication properties are sometimes
displayed graphically by a circle surrounded by a triangle, but we shall not bother to exhibit that.
the multiplication law (3) shows that the rst four elements form a closed associative subalgebra

of o, which is known as the quaternion algebra,

q  he0, e1, e2, e3iir .

while the other rules (2), (4) and (5) show that o can be graded as follows:

o = q  q ,

where

q := e4q .

(7)

(8)

o is a non-associative algebra. now a measure of the non-associativity in any algebra a is provided
by the associator, which is dened for any 3 elements, as follows

in particular, the associators for the octonion basis are

(x, y, z) := (xy)z  x(yz) ,

for x, y, z  a .

(ei, ej, ek) = 2ijklel ,

(9)

(10)

where ijkl are totally antisymmetric [9] and equal to unity for the following 7 combinations [5]:

1247, 1265, 2345 , 2376 , 3146 , 3157 and 4576 .

(11)

the quaternionic subalgebra q
it is very well-known that the quaternions form an associative subalgebra q , which can be repre-
sented by the pauli matrices:

e0  0 = 1 ,

where, as usual,

0 =  1 0

0 1 ! , 1 =  0 1

0 ! , 3 =  1 0

0 1 ! .

(j = 1, 2, 3) ,

and ej  ij
1 0 ! , 2 =  0 i

i

it is trivial to check that the above map is an isomorphism:

eiej  ij = (ij + iijk k)  ij + ijk ek .

iii. non-associative multiplication

(12)

(13)

(14)

in contrast to q, the cayley algebra o cannot be represented by matrices with the usual multipli-
cation rules, because o is not associative. however, as we demonstrate below, it is possible to
represent octonions by matrices, provided one denes a special multiplication rule among them.

zorns representation of octonions

zorn [7] gave a representation of the octonions [8] in terms of 2  2 matrices m , whose diagonal
elements are scalars and whose o-diagonal elements are 3-dimensional vectors:

o  x    a

b  ! ,

(15)

and invoked a peculiar multiplication rule for these matrices [7]. with slight modication of the
rule adopted by humphreys [10] p. 105 our rule is:

   a
b  !    a

b  ! =   + a  b

b + b + a  a

a + a  b  b
 + b  a

! .

(16)

we propose to adapt this multiplication law to octonions and also replace the necessary 3-dimensional
basis vectors vk by pauli matrices k (k = 1, 2, 3), so that the octonions can be represented by the
following ordinary 4  4 matrices:
e0  0   1 0
0 1 ! ,
0 i ! ,
e4  4   i

ek  k   0 k
ek  bk   0

0 ! ,
0 ! .

(note the equality of k (k = 1, 2, 3) to the dirac matrices k , and 4 to i0 in the pauli-dirac
representation.) it can be shown by explicit multiplication, that the above map (17) becomes an
isomorphism, provided we dene the modied product rule, which we denote by  :

(k = 1, 2, 3)

(17)

ik

ik

k

0

   a
b  !    a

b  ! =   + 1

2 tr (ab)

b + b  i

2 [a, a]

a + a + i
 + 1

2 tr (ba)

2 [b, b]

! .

(18)

3

where [a, b]  ab  ba is the commutator of a and b . of course, a = a   and b = b  
are traceless: tr a = tr b = 0 .

in particular, the above multiplication rule yields the following relations

  0

which are helpful for checking the multiplication rules (2)-(5), by substituting the appropriate
coecients,  and  .

the standard conjugate of octonions

usually, octonions are studied over the eld of real numbers ir,

x =

7x=0

xe  x0 + x,

for x  ir,

(20)

although later we will nd it interesting to deal with their complex extension. the standard
conjugate x of an octonion over ir is dened by

the reason for this denition is that the product of x with x yields a positive denite norm:

x := x0e0 

7xi=1

xiei  x0  x.

n(x) = xx = xx =

7x=0

x2
  0 .

moreover, this norm obeys the composition law,

n(xy) = n(x)n(y).

(21)

(22)

(23)

however with complex octonions (real x  complex z in (20)) we shall still formally dene the
conjugate z of z, to be

it follows that the product zz is again proportional to unity :

z := z0e0 

ziei ,

for

z  lc .

7xi=1

n(z) = zz = zz =

7x=0

z2
  lc ,

(24)

(25)

but n(z) ceases to be real in general; therefore n(z) should simply be regarded as a scalar function,
but not a norm.

it is interesting to calculate n(z) by using the matrix representation (26): firstly, we note that

if z is mapped into the matrix z, then z will be mapped into z, as follows:

z  z 

z =   a

b  ! ,

7x=0

z  z    a

b  ! ,

(26)

4

where a = a   and b = b   , with

secondly,

 = z0 + iz4 ,  = z0  iz4 , ak = zk + iz4+k , bk = zk + iz4+k (k = 1, 2, 3).
0 1 ! = n(z) i44
zz  z z =   a

b  !    a

tr ab)  1 0

b  ! = (

therefore, we reproduce the expression (25), as expected:

n(z) :=

1

tr (z z) =  

1
2

tr ab =   a  b =

z2
 .

7x=0

(27)

(28)

(29)

hermitian conjugate of octonions

since i are hermitian matrices, all our representation matrices k are anti-hermitian, with the
exception of the identity 0 (which is hermitian of course) :

this fact enables us to prove that the following hermiticity property also holds for the  products:


k = k ,

k = 1, 2, , 7 .

(30)

(  ) = 

  

 ,

for ,  = 0, 1, . . . , 7 .

(31)

first, we note that this equality holds trivially for (0  ) = 
(31) for j, k 6= 0 by using (6) and noting that k
7xi=1

(j  k) = jk 0 +

i = kj 0 +

7xi=1

kji = k  j = 
i

jk
i

 = 

  

0. second, we prove

ij are real and antisymmetric in j, k, so that

k  

j , j, k = 1, , 7 . (32)

the conjugation property (31) of  suggests the following formal denition for the hermitian
conjugate of the octonionic basis:

whereupon the number operators become equal to the identity element:

e
0 = e0 ,

e
j = ej

(j = 1, 2, , 7) ,

n := e

e = ee

 = e0 = 1 ,

(no summation)

( = 0, 1, , 7) .

we can now dene the hermitian conjugate of the complex octonions z in a natural way, by

z :=

7x=0

ze

 = z0e0 

7xi=1

ziei  z0  z , where zi  lc .

we then calculate

zz  (z0 + z)(z0  z) = |z0|2 + (z0z  z0z)  zz

=

7x=0 |z|2 

= n (z) + 2i

(z0 zk  zk z0)ek +

7xk=1
7xk=1z0zk + x1i<j7

7x1i<j

zi zjk

ij ek ,

(zi zj  zj zi)eiej

5

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

where

n (z) =

7x=0 |z|2 .

(37)

the denition n (z) is perfectly reasonable for a norm although the decomposition law (23) is not
satised. we see that the space components (zz)i of zz are pure imaginary. to understand why
this is expected on general grounds, it is useful to introduce the concept of a hermitian octonion:
y = y , which signies that

y0 = y0 ,

yi = yi (i = 1, , 7) ,

(38)

so that y0 must be real and all the space components must be pure imaginary.

since zz is hermitian by (31), we see that its space components can only be pure imaginary.
if we wish to get rid of these components and retain only the zero component, we must add the
standard conjugate. thus, we may dene the hermitian norm by

n (z) = (zz + zz)/2 .

(39)

hence, if z is mapped into z, then z will be mapped into z , which is obtained by the standard
hermitian conjugation of the matrix z.

one of the main insights gained by using the matrix representation is when we calculate the

hermitian norm. if

z  z = z =   a

b  ! ,

the product

then z  z  =   b

b + a + i

2 [b, a]

2 tr bb

! .

(40)

(41)

the zero component of zz is proportional to the trace of z z , so that the new hermitian norm
can be expressed in terms of the representation matrices z as follows:

n (z) =

1

tr (z z ) =

2 ||2 + ||2 +

(|ak|2 + |bk|2)! =
3xk=1

7x=0 |z|2 ,

4(cid:16)tr (aa) + tr (bb)(cid:17)

(42)

in accordance with (37). for real z we get    , b  a in (26). therefore, ab  aa =
a   a   = a  a. thus, the formally dened scalar reduces to a conventional norm:

n (z) =   a  b = ||2 + a  a  ||2 +

3xk=1|ak|2 =

7x=0

x2
  n(z)  0 .

non-associative algebras from lie algebras

the main advantage of our matrix representation over the zorn vector representation, is that our
multiplication rule can be generalized to any number n of dimensions, whereas the zorn rule is
restricted, since it is dened in terms of vector product a  b, which only applies to 3-vectors!
in particular, given any representation of an n-dimensional lie algebra g in terms of hermitian
n  n matrices k (k = 1, 2, , n) , we can then dene 2n + 2 dierent 2n -dimensional matrices,

e0  0   1 0
e0  n+2   i

0 1 ! ,
0 i ! ,

0

ek  k   0 k
ek  k   0

0 ! ,
0 ! .

ik

ik

k

(k = 1, , n)

(44)

if we multiply these matrices using the  rule, we end up with a closed algebra, which we shall call

the double algebra gd, with the following product rules for their basis elements (b0  n+2):

b0bk = bkb0 = k ,

b0b0 = 0 ,

b0k = kb0 = bk ,
ij = ij 0 + fijk k ,
bibj = ij 0  fijk k ,
bji = ibj = ij b0  fijk bk .

above, the fijk are the structure constants of the lie algebra g, dened as usual by

[li, lj] = ifijklk .

(45)

(46)

(49)

(50)

(51)

the matrices (44) can be regarded as the - matrix representation of the following (non-associative)
abstract algebra:

 e0ek = ek e0 = ek ,

e0ek = ek e0 = ek ,

eiej = ij e0 + fijkek ,
eiej = ij e0  fijkek ,
ejei = eiej = ij e0  fijkek .

e0e0 = e0 ,

where

e0  en+2 , (47)
(48)

these rules (47)-(50) can all be summarized by (,  = 0, 1, 2, , 2n + 2)

ee = g e0 +

2n+2xk=1

k
 ek,

g := diag (1,1, ,1) ,

k
ij = k
ji .

we note from (44) that the e ,  = 0, 1, , n correspond to a subalgebra g+ of gd. the
rules (47) show that the double algebra gd is obtained from g+ simply by adding a new element,
called e0, and dening the other ek. this lie algebra example then automatically leads us to
a more general doubling procedure, which can be applied to any algebra and not just to those
constructed from lie algebras. in fact this doubling idea is exactly the procedure which is known
as the cayley-dickson process, as we shall see below.

7

iv. deformed multiplication and the a algebra
begin with the following subset of 2n  2n -matrices:
b  ! a, b  mn n) ,

a :=(   a

(52)

where the n  n matrices  and  in the 1st and 4th quadrants are proportional to unit matrices.
among these matrices we may dene a more general [11] multiplication rule than that given in
(18). we shall still denote it by  since it only introduces two complex deformation parameters 0
and  (their values will be restricted as we impose further conditions on the subalgebras) :

b + b + [a, a]

a + a  [b, b]
 + 0 b  a

b  !   a

b  ! :=   + 0 a  b

x  x     a
!. (53)
as before, [a, b]  ab  ba denotes the commutator, but a  b may now be chosen to be
any suitable bilinear map into an appropriate eld f . for example, one might dene a  b by
a  b  tr (ab)/n , or if a and b belong to a lie algebra, then one could take a  b to be the
adjoint trace: a  b := tr (ad a ad b) , where ad denotes the adjoint representation [12]
when  = 0 and 0 = 1 the multiplication rule (53) looks almost like the usual one for matrices.
however, it still yields non-associativity, since we are replacing matrix products, such as ab, by
a  b times the unit matrix. but in any case, it is evident that with the  product the set a
becomes a closed algebra, which we denote by a [13].

complex numbers from real

before continuing, let us consider the simplest example of the above matrices, namely the case
n = 1. in this circumstance, the matrices a and b become simple commuting numbers, a and
b. if we specialize further, and choose  =  and b = a to be real, we end up with 2-parameter
matrices. their products are

x  x    

a

a  !   

a  ! :=    0aa

a + a

a

a + a

  0aa ! ,

(54)

and this is nothing but the multiplication rule of two complex numbers z and z, provided that we
set 0 = 1 and identify  and a with the real and imaginary parts of z . thus, a subalgebra of a
for n = 0 = 1 becomes isomorphic to the complex numbers lc:

a  x =  

a

a  !  z   + ia  lc

(55)

.

simple and hermitian conjugates

the attractive feature of the generalization (53) is that most results and denitions needed for
octonions apply almost automatically to a. for example, for every element x  a we can
dene a conjugate element x, as follows:

x =   a

b  ! :=   a

b  ! .

8

(56)

by substituting a  a , b  b,    and    in (53), we get immediately
0 1 !  n(x)i2n 2n ,

b  ! = (  0 a  b)  1 0

b  !    a

x x =   a

(57)

where n(x)  lc . in the meantime, we should again look upon n(x) simply as a scalar function,
dened by the map a  lc in (58). later we shall study the conditions on a under which
n(x) becomes a norm.

v. subalgebras of a
the algebra a has several interesting subalgebras :

 an obvious subalgebra is the one obtained by choosing both matrices a and b to be traceless:

0 :=(   a

b  ! tr a = tr b = 0) ,

a

(58)

 this subalgebra has in turn another subalgebra a

antisymmetric matrices.

a  a

0 , in which a and b become

 a third subalgebra, which we denote by a

+ , is obtained by choosing  =  and b = a :

+ :=(   a
a

a  !) .

(59)

!  a

+ .

(60)

it is easily veried that products of such matrices stay in the same class:

x  x  =    a

a  !
a  !    a

=     0 a  a

a  a + [a, a]   0 a  a

a + a  [a, a]

+ has the interesting property:

moreover, a
proposition 1 : the subalgebra a
to put this result into perspective, we note that all abelian or anti-commutative algebras are
exible; thus if yx = xy, then x(yx) = (yx)x = (xy)x, so that (x, y, x) = 0 . therefore,
it is of interest to show that a
+ , which is neither abelian nor anti-commutative, is also exible.

+ is exible for all matrices a .

proof : we shall prove the above assertion by explicit multiplication. however, to simplify
the calculations we rst note that the multiples of unity added to each element do not aect
the associators:

(x + 1, y + 1, z + 1) = (x, y, z) ,

(61)

where 1 is the identity matrix. this follows immediately from the linearity of associators:

(x + 1, y, z) = (x, y, z) + (1, y, z) = (x, y, z) .

(62)

9

the property (61) is helpful for calculating associators of the subalgebra a
set the s equal to zero, when calculating the associators.
we now calculate explicitly the associator (x1, x2, x3) for general matrices from a
using only those with i = 0, i.e.

+ , since we can

+ , but

xi =  0

we get

ai

i = 1, 2, 3 .

p = 0 ([a1, a2]  a3) ,
p = 0(a1  a2) a3 + 2[[a1, a2], a3] .

q = 0 (a1  [a2, a3]) ,
q = 0(a2  a3) a1 + 2[a1, [a2, a3]] .

therefore, the elements of the associator (x1, x2, x3) are

p  q = 0 ([a1, a2]  a3  a1  [a2, a3]) = 0 ,
p  q = 0 ((a1  a2) a3  (a2  a3) a1) + 2 ([ [a1, a2], a3]  [a1, [a2, a3] ])

= 0 ((a1  a2) a3  (a2  a3) a1) + 2[a2, [a3, a1] ] .

(65)

(66)

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

in other words, the associator (x, y, x) vanishes identically, for any , 0, a1 = a3 and a2,

(x, y, x) = 0 ,

for x, y  a
+ .

(71)

 as a fourth subalgebra, let g be a given lie algebra of dimension n, and let vg be the algebra

spanned by the representation matrices of g. then, we can dene a subalgebra of a via

gd :=(   a

b  ! a, b  vg) .

clearly the o-diagonal elements, such as a + a + [b, b], of the products x x  belong
to vg . hence, gd are subalgebras of a0. moreover, half of gd , obtained by the intersection
of gd with a

+ , will be a subalgebra of gd:

matrix representation of the cayley-dickson process
if we multiply the grading matrix k by a real or complex scalar v, and let   v2 , we get

vop := vk ,

vopvop := v21 = 1 .

(88)

therefore, using the relations (81) - (84), we get the multiplication rule

(x1 + vopx2)(x3 + vopx4) = (x1 x3 + x4 x2) + vop(x 1 x4 + x3 x2) ,

xi  a

+ . (89)

this is exactly the multiplication rule given by cayley and dickson where one starts with an
abstract algebra b and denes an abstract operator vop, and essentially postulates the following
multiplication rule [8]:

(b1 + vopb2)(b3 + vopb4) = (b1b3 + b4b2) + vop(b1b4 + b3b2) ,

bi  b .

(90)

observe that the  multiplication rule provides an explicit matrix representation of the cayley-

where bi  b is the conjugate of bi, and vop / b , such that v2
dickson process [8], provided that the original algebra b can be represented by a
+ .
composition algebras from 2  2 matrices
one may wonder what happens if we allow the rudim entary 2  2 matrices to contain arbitrary
complex elements. since

op =   1 .

x  x     a

b  !    a

b  ! :=   + 0 ab

b + b

a + a

 + 0 ba ! ,

when x  = x this product yields a norm,

x  x = n(x)  1 0
0 1 ! ,

where n(x) =   0ab .

(91)

(92)

it is easy to check, by explicit multiplication, that the following identity holds for any 0  lc:
n(x)n(x) = (0ab)(0ab) = (+0 ab)(+0 ba)0(a+a)(b+b) = n(xx)
(93)
which informs us that the standard norm (92) for n = 1 obeys the composition law.

clearly, the norm (92) is degenerate for any 0  lc, if we allow x to be any 2 2 matrix. (for
example, simply choosing  = a = b = 1 and  = 0 will yield an x 6= 0 with n(x) = 0ab = 0 .)
the question then arises, when is the norm n(x) in (92) nondegenerate? we can certainly guarantee
that n(x) is nondegenerate, if we restrict x to have the following special form:

x =  z

 w z ! ,

w

and 0 > 0 .

(94)

12

whence

n(x) = |z|2 + 0|w|2 6= 0 ,

for 0 6= 0 .

(95)

[of course, there exist a few equivalent variations of the conditions (94). for instance, we can
replace  w by w, but demand that 0 < 0 .]
of the 4 possibilities. because x  m22 , we may expand it in terms of pauli matrices, getting

anyhow, this means that we are dealing with a division algebra, which must therefore be one

x =   z

 w z ! = z1  1 0

0 1 ! + iw2  0 1

3xk=1

(96)

since e0  0 and ej  ij j = 1, 2, 3 are known representations of the quaternions, we conclude
that this is the quaternion algebra over the real eld ir , as expected. indeed the matrix (96) is
the usual representation of q in terms of standard matrices. later on we shall describe another
representation by nonstandard matrices.

vii. conditions on deformation parameters

previously we showed that a
alternative.

+ is exible. we now ask under what conditions a

+ can become

for this, we must have (x1, x1, x3) = 0 . by setting x2 = x1 and noting eq.(70), we get the

condition

[a1, [a3, a1] ] =

2
0

= ((a1  a1) a3  (a1  a3) a1) .

(97)

this condition can be satised if 2 = 0/4 and the ai = ai   : indeed, for such ai, we get

[a2, [a3, a1] ] = [a2   , 2i[a3  a1]   ] = 4[a2  [a3  a1]]  

= 4((a2  a3)a1  (a2  a1)a3)   = 4 ((a1  a2) a3  (a2  a3) a1)

(98)
20 . for the special choice

2 tr (ab) . hence, we can have  =  1

where we used (a  b) = 1
0 = 1, we get  =  i
2 .

this sign ambiguity is the origin of the non-uniqueness of the  product [14].

viii. summary

our algebras provide concrete matrix representation of a big class of non-associative algebras. they
may suggest new constructions in the future. one such possibility, which leads to notions of triality,
is described in the appendix a, but anyhow the formulation (18) and its deformations (53) permit
generalizations that have obvious anity to higher symmetry groups, rather than the simple case
of su(2). we also believe that our treatment of hermiticity and norm for the complex case is
reasonable; we illustrate their utility with reference to the dirac equation in appendix b.

appendix a. the  product and triality
in this appendix we try another type of product, which we denote by , where the commutators
[b, b] in the  product are now replaced by the standard matrix products bb.
let us rst consider the simplest case, n = 1, where the matrices a and b become scalars, so
that we shall rst deal with 2  2 matrices:

x    a
b  ! .

we dene the new matrix product, as follows

x  x     a

b  !    a

b  ! :=   + 0 ab

b + b + aa

(99)

(100)

a + a + bb
 + 0 ba

! ,

where , , 0 are arbitrary complex numbers. we now ask the question, whether for such a product,
we can dene for every x a conjugate x, such that xx = n(x)1 , where n(x) is some quadratic
form of x, i.e. n(sx) = s2n(x) .

let us try the following ansatz:

x    +  a

 +  ! .

b

(101)

we want to determine  and , and derive conditions on , , a, b, by demanding that x  x  1 :

x  x =    a

b

 !    +  a
b
0 1 ! ,

 +  ! =  ( + )  0ab
where n(x) = ( + )  0ab .

b  a2

= n(x)  1 0

a  b2

( + )  0ab !

(102)

this condition is obeyed, if

a  b2 = 0 ,

b  a2 = 0 ,

and  = ,

(103)

we cannot satisfy these conditions for general a and b. (for example, if a = 0 and b 6= 0, then 
would be innite.) thus, for  6= 0 we must assume that either both a and b are zero or both are
unequal to zero. but for  = 0 we must demand b = 0. with these restrictions, we get

(x) = 

b2
a

,

(x) = 

a2
b

,

and




=




= 

a3
b3 .

(104)

an additional condition can be obtained by demanding that the adjoint operation is an involution,
so that x = x, whence

x =    + (x) + (x) a

 + (x) + (x) !

b

=    + ( b2

b

a   a2

b ) a

a ) ! =   a

 ! = x .

b

 + ( a2

b + b2

thus, we get the new condition

b3 =  a3 ,

or

b = a ,

where

 = 1/3 ,

14

(105)

(106)

note that for each  we have three cubic roots  . substituting (106) into the third equality in
(104), we get

 =  ,

and  =  .

(107)

hence, a can be any complex number as long as b = a. finally, by noting all the above conditions,
we get for every   lc three sets of 2 2 matrices, which are closed algebras under the product  :

(108)

(109)

(110)

(111)

x() =(  

a  !) ,

a

 = 1/3  lc ,

for these matrices, the adjoint and the corresponding quadratic form are

x    + 2a
a

 + 2a ! .
a

and

n(x) = ( + )  0ab = 2 +  

a2
b  0ab

= 2 + 2 a  0a2 .

note that n(x) is quadratic in x, i.e. n (sx) = s2 n (x), s  lc .

for the special case b = a, or  = 1 , we obtain a known quadratic form [11]

n(x) = 2 +  a + 0a2 .

proceeding to larger matrices, let

b  !    a

x  x     a
  lc .
(112)
one can readily check that such matrices yield closed algebras with respect to the above  product.
by restricting b to be a we get the following subalgebra:

b  ! :=   + 0 a  b

a + a + bb
 + 0 b  a

b + b + aa

! ,

x() =(  

a  !) ,

a

 = 1/3  lc .

(113)

we can check, using (112), that products of two such matrices yield a matrix of the same type:

x  x     a

a  !    a

a  ! =   + 0 a  a

(a + a) + aa

a + a + 2aa
 + 0 a  a

! .

(114)
however, if we replace the scalar a in eqs. (109) and (110) by a matrix a, we do not get an adjoint
nor a bilinear form, since the appropriate items do not stay scalar, as they should.

finally we note that if we replace the simple products aa
{a, a}/2 and if we make the scalar products a  a symmetric, i.e.
a  ! s    a
   a

a  ! :=   + 0 a  a

(a + a) + {a, a}/2

in (114) by anticommutators

a + a + 2{a, a}/2
 + 0 a  a

! ,

then the product becomes abelian. therefore the new algebra will automatically become exible.
one can similarly symmetrize the more general product (112) by dening, x s x  := (x 

x  + x   x)/2, and also get a exible algebra.

appendix b. application to the dirac equation

in momentum space, the free dirac equation reads

p   (p0  p    m) =  p0  m p  

p   p0 + m !  = 0 .

(115)

by noting that the standard matrix product and the  products between the dirac operator p and
its conjugate p are equal, we immediately obtain

p p = p  p = n(p ) i =(cid:16)(p0  m)(p0 + m)  p2(cid:17) i = 0 ,

(116)

where we used eq. (28) to calculate the norm n(p ). therefore each of the 4 columns of p will be
a solution of the dirac equation (115). hence, we write

 = p =  p0 + m p  

p0  m ! .

p  

(117)

the rst and second columns of  are proportional to the positive energy solutions u1(p) and
u2(p), while the third and fourth columns yield the negative energy solutions v1(p) and v2(p), if we
replace m by m, because

(p0  p    m)ui(p) = 0,

(p0  p   + m)vi(p) = 0,

(i = 1, 2).

(118)

therefore the physical and normalizable solutions can be expressed as

ph (cid:16)u1|u2|v1|v2(cid:17) =

1

p2m(p0 + m)  p0 + m p  

p0 + m ! .

p  

the orthogonality and normaliztion relations among these solutions

(119)

ui(p)vj(p)  ui(p)vj (p) = 0 ,
ui(p)uj(p)  ui(p)uj (p) = ij,

and

and

vi(p)uj(p)  vi(p)uj(p) = 0 ,
vi(p)vj (p)  vi(p)vj (p) = ij

(i, j = 1, 2),

can also be elegantly summarized and proved using the matrix representations of octonions, as
follows



phph = phph = ph ph =(cid:0)ph  ph(cid:1)  = n(ph) =  .

finally, it is interesting to note that the dirac operator p is equal to our matrix representation of
the following octonion:

(120)

(121)

(122)

p  (p0  p    m) =  p0  m p  

p   p0 + m !  p  (p0 + ip  e + ime4) ,
0 1 ! = i4  ie4.

 =  1

0

where we have used the correspondence

k =  0

k

k

0 ! = i k  iek,

notice that we cannot write the dirac equation in terms of quaternions alone, since we require
ve dierent basis elements: (e0, e4, ek; k = 1, 2, 3) or (e0, e4, ek; k = 1, 2, 3). also note that the
octonion p is nicely hermitian (p = p) .

[9] the complete antisymmetry of ijkl in its rst three indices is an immediate consequence of
the fact that o is an alternative algebra, such algebras being dened by the two alternative
conditions :

x2y = x(xy) ,

and (yx)x = yx2 ,

 x, y  a .

these conditions can be expressed in terms of associators as (x, x, y) = (y, x, x) = 0 ,
 x, y 
a . they enable one to prove that the associator (x, y, z) of an alternative algebra is totally
antisymmetric in its three arguments. the proof is based on the linearization technique, which
consists of replacing one or more of the arguments, say x, by x + w. by this means we get

(x+w, x+w, y) = (x, x, y)+2(w, w, y)+(w, x, y)+(x, w, y) = ( (w, x, y)+(x, w, y) ) = 0 ,

17

so that (w, x, y) = (x, w, y) . one can similarly prove the antisymmetry among the other
arguments. in particular, the total antisymmetry yields

(x, y, x) = 0 ,

or

(z, y, x) + (x, y, z) = 0 ,

where the second equality follows the rst, again by linearization. algebras which obey these
last conditions are called exible . these conditions are much less restrictive than the alter-
native conditions. in fact, most of the interesting non-associative algebras are exible. for
example, both the lie and jordan algebras are exible, the jordan algebras j being dened
by the (jordan) identities:

(x2, y, x) = (x, y, x2) = 0 ,

 x, y  j .

see n. jacobson, structure and representations of jordan algebras (american math. soc.,
1968). we shall nd another class of exible algebras below.

[12] note, that although xi  xj = 2ij

(i, j = 1, 2, 3) for xi  so(3), the diagonal elements of

xi  xj can have dierent signs, as in so(2, 1), where (xi  xj) = diag(2,2, 2) .

[13] actually we can generalize a further, by replacing the product of the complex numbers 
 , where  = ()/2. we have refrained

with a bilinear product    = 2
from doing so in the text.

[14] thus if we reverse the sign in front of the  in (17) we only need to change the sign of the

commutators in (18) to x the multiplication rule.
