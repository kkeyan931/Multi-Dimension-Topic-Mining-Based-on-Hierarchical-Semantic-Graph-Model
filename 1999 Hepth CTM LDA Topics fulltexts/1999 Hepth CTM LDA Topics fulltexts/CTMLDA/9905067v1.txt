abstract

as a test of the conjectured qcd/supergravity duality, we consider mass gaps in
the supergravity construction of qcd2. we nd a mass gap in the dual eld theory
both when using non-rotating and rotating black d2-branes as backgrounds in the
supergravity construction of qcd2. so, since pure qcd2 does not have a mass
gap, the dual eld theory of the supergravity construction of qcd2 cannot be pure
qcd2. considering the mass scales in the dual eld theory of the supergravity
construction of qcd2, we nd that this is explainable both in the case of the non-
rotating background and of the rotating background. in particular, the mass gap
in the case of the rotating background can be explained using results of the large
angular momentum limit of euclidean rotating branes, obtained recently by cvetic
and gubser. we furthermore remark on the possible implications for the mass gaps
in the supergravity constructions of qcd3 and qcd4.

introduction and summary

in [1] maldacena conjectured a duality between large n superconformal eld theories
with maximal supersymmetry and superstring theory or m-theory on certain anti-de
sitter backgrounds3. as an extension of this, witten conjectured in [2] an approach
to study large n non-conformal and non-supersymmetric eld theories such as pure
qcd (in this paper pure qcd means pure yang-mills theory) at strong coupling
using string theory on certain background geometries. according to this conjec-
tured duality, the large n expansion of the eld theory should be identied to the
perturbative expansion of the string theory, and the strong coupling expansion of
the eld theory should be identied to the ls =  expansion of the string the-
ory. in particular, one could hope to study qcd for large n and for large t hooft
coupling  = g2
y m n via a dual supergravity background, being the semiclassical
approximation to weakly coupled string theory.

this idea has received much attention recently and it is found that the supergrav-
ity description of qcd has many qualitative similarities with the expectations one
has of pure qcd at strong coupling4. however, already from the beginning it has
been clear that to really get to qcd, one must take a limit where the supergravity
approximation breaks down, and one must instead consider at least tree-level string
theory in a rather singular background[2, 4]. but, until a better understanding of
string theory in these backgrounds is reached, one can try to probe how far the
supergravity can be used in understanding eld theories at large n .

one of the aspects of qcd that has been discussed is the existence of a mass
gap for glueball states. witten initiated the study of this question in [2], and it has
been studied further in several recent papers[8, 6, 5, 9]. the upshot of these papers
is that qcd3 (qcd4) is constructed from a background of n black d3-branes (d4-
branes) in the eld theory limit and that the existence of the mass gap can be shown
by considering the dilaton uctuation equation in the particular background, since
the dilaton couples to the tr(f 2) term in the expansion of the born-infeld action.

as pointed out in [5, 10], there are problems in this procedure for nding a mass
gap in pure qcd from the supergravity construction of qcd. the main problem
is that the mass gap is of the same order as the cuto in the theory. an attempt to
solve this was rst proposed in [10] by introducing rotating black branes, and was
later extended in [11]. the claim of these papers is that for certain limits of the
angular momentum, the scale of the cuto should decouple from the scale of the mass
gap. this would mean that the fermion mass scale mf and the mass gap scale mgap
obey mgap << mf . however, as argued in [12], this does not seem to hold since
some of the fermions do not decouple from the mass gap scale in the considered limit.
so, for both the non-rotating and rotating backgrounds it is not certain whether a
non-zero eigenvalue of the dilaton uctuation equation corresponds to a mass gap
in pure qcd.

in this paper, we study the supergravity construction of qcd2 for two main

purposes:

1) until now, the proposed qcd/supergravity duality has almost exclusively
been used on qcd3 and qcd4, so one of the purposes of this paper is to test the
proposed duality in the case of pure qcd2(in [7] qcd2 from supergravity has been
studied, but not the particular aspects that we consider in this paper).

2) the pure qcd2 theory on a plane has no glueball mass gap, since the gluons
have no degrees of freedom. thus, contrary to the qcd3 and qcd4 cases, the
supergravity description of qcd2 is not supposed to predict the existence of a mass
gap. so, in this paper, we will try to test whether a mass gap is predicted by the
supergravity description.

in this paper, we consider both the non-rotating(see section 2) and rotating(see
section 3) supergravity backgrounds for studying qcd2. the non-rotating back-
ground consists of n black d2-branes in the eld theory limit and the rotating
background consists of n rotating black d2-branes in the eld theory limit.

in this paper, we nd that a mass gap is predicted for pure qcd2 for both non-
rotating and rotating backgrounds. so, for pure qcd2 the supergravity construction
of qcd2 has totally dierent properties than the eld theory it was supposed to be
dual to. we argue in section 2 and 3 that this is explainable when considering the
mass scales in the eld theories dual to the supergravity backgrounds. in section 4
we present the conclusions.

2 mass gap from non-rotating black d2-branes

to study qcd2 from supergravity we must construct an appropriate supergravity
background which is dual to a two dimensional non-supersymmetric eld theory. to
do this, we start by considering n d2-branes in the eld theory limit[13]

in order to trust the supergravity description, we must have[13]

1 << g2

y m3n u 1 << n 4/5

so, we have that n >> 1 and g2
y m3n >> u which means that we consider the
large n limit of the su (n ) gauge theory on the world-volume of the d2-branes, at
strong coupling. since it is the large n limit, we introduce the t hooft coupling

one can also start from the 11 dimensional supergravity background ads4  s 7,
with ads4 being an anti-de sitter black hole in 4 dimensions (this approach to
qcd2 was suggested in [7]). however, compactifying the s 7 on a circle in the usual
m-theory/type iia duality manner, one gets the above solution.

the world-volume theory of black d2-branes is a 2 + 1 dimensional theory de-
scribed at low energies by the born-infeld action. it is a non-supersymmetric theory,
since the d2-branes are non-extremal and the fermions acquire masses of order the
temperature t , even before quantum corrections[2]. so, we have a 2 dimensional
non-supersymmetric eld theory if we consider energies much smaller than the tem-
perature. we introduce the two-dimensional yang-mills coupling constant

and the t hooft coupling

g2
y m2 = t g2

y m3

2 = t 3

this is the appropriate coupling constants for the dual 2 dimensional eld theory.

the coupling of the world-volume elds with the dilaton can be found by ex-
panding the born-infeld action, as done in [6]. from this, one nds that the dilaton
couples to tr(f 2). if we consider the dilaton uctuation h on the background eld
 stated above, we get the dilaton uctuation equation

introducing the ansatz

(cid:16)e2gg  h(cid:17) = 0

h = f (z)eik1y1+ik2y2

where z  u/u0, equation (5) yields

the dilaton uctuations are imposed to be regular at z = 1, and also to be square
integrable with respect to the metric (2). together, these boundary conditions are
sucient to make a well-posed sturm-liouville problem which can be solved by
standard methods, such as a wkb approximation or a series solution. the result
is that m has a discrete spectrum, with a rst eigenvalue of m  11 t (this fact can
also be deduced from [9]).
if we proceeded in the same way as in [2, 8, 5, 6, 9] for the qcd3 and qcd4
cases, then we would predict a mass gap in pure qcd2. but, as stated in the
introduction, pure qcd2 on a plane has no mass gap so this procedure cannot be
correct. the reason for this comes from the fact that both the mass gap and the
supersymmetry restoration energy are of order the temperature t . this means that
we cannot expect the fermions to decouple in the eld theory for which we have
computed the mass gap. so, it seems that we are not predicting a mass gap in
pure qcd2 but rather in a theory containing fermions. this also seems to suggest
that one cannot conclude anything about the existence of a mass gap in qcd3 and
qcd4 from supergravity using non-rotating black d-branes, since these theories
also predict a mass gap of order the temperature (this was rst noted in [5, 10]).

3 mass gap from rotating black d2-branes

an attempt to solve the problem that the mass gap scale and the fermion mass scale
are of the same order was pointed out by russo in [10], and developed further in
[11]. by considering rotating d-branes it was found that one could decouple the
mass gap scale in qcd3 and qcd4 from the scale of the temperature in the limit
of very high angular momenta.

a non-rotating black d2-brane has an so(6) rotational symmetry in the trans-
verse space, so since we can break so(6) into so(2)  so(2)  so(2), we can have
3 angular momentum parameters, l1, l2 and l3. however, as we shall see, we only
need one angular momentum l = l1 to decouple the scale of the mass gap from
the scale of the temperature. the rotating black d2-brane solution can be obtained
from the rotating black hole solutions in an 8 dimensional space-time as done in [14].
to transform this solution with minkowski signature to a solution with euclidean
signature, one uses the transformation t  i t and l  i l. the eld theory limit
for n rotating d2-branes is[10, 11]

which reduces to (8) when a = 0 as it should. the solutions of this equation are
again constrained to be regular at the horizon and to be square-integrable with
respect to the metric (9), and they can be found by means of a wkb method [11].

we shall now consider the limit a >> u0 to show that the mass gap scale
decouples from the scale of the temperature in this limit. for a >> u0 we have
so we nd that the a >> u0 limits of (12)

u+  a and from (16) we have   u 3/2

and (15) are

+

t  a4, m  a3/2

(18)

respectively. this shows that the scale of the mass gap decouples from the scale of
the temperature for a >> u0.

thus, if for a moment we suppose that the scalars and fermions in the d2-brane
eld theory get masses of order the temperature or higher, we are inevitably lead to
the conclusion that pure qcd2 has a mass gap, because of the decoupling shown
above. therefore, since pure qcd2 does not have a mass gap, the conclusion must
be that some of the fermions or scalars do not decouple from the mass gap scale.
this conclusion has also been reached in [12], where it was shown for rotating m2,

m5 and d3-branes that some of the fermions get masses of order p1  a/u+ t .

since we consider m2-branes with the transverse space compactied on a circle, this
also applies to our case. that some of the fermions are becoming lighter with higher
angular momentum means that a fraction of the original supersymmetry in the non-
rotating extremal case is restored for a >> u0, as mentioned in [12]. in our case we
get

p1  a/u+ t  a5/2t  a3/2

(19)

so, some of the fermions have the same mass scale as the mass gap in this limit.
this means that the mass gap that we have obtained for a >> u0 is not a mass gap
of pure qcd2, but instead a mass gap in a theory containing fermions, just as in
the non-rotating case. as stated in [12], this result seems to apply also to the pure
qcd3 and qcd4 cases, so also in these cases it seems that one cannot establish
the existence of a mass gap from rotating branes in supergravity.

4 conclusions

in this paper we have considered the correspondence between qcd2 and supergrav-
ity. to test this correspondence, we have tried to see if the supergravity construction
of qcd2 predicts a mass gap. we found that a mass gap was predicted using non-
rotating and rotating black d2-branes as supergravity backgrounds. since pure
qcd2 does not have a mass gap, this suggests that the supergravity construction of
qcd2 does not fully reproduce the dynamics of pure qcd2. as argued in sections 2
and 3, the reason for this was that, for both non-rotating and rotating supergravity
backgrounds, the dual eld theory for which we found a mass gap contained fermions
and was therefore not pure qcd2.

6

that we found a mass gap for rotating d2-branes can be seen as a conrmation
of the results of [12], since their results precisely explain the discrepancy between
the supergravity construction of qcd2 and pure qcd2.

as already stated, it seems that the problems for the mass gap calculation in
the supergravity construction of qcd2 also apply for the qcd3 and qcd4 cases,
both for non-rotating and rotating d-branes. so, as concluded in [12], it seems that
there is no a priori reason to believe that the supergravity constructions of qcd3
and qcd4 can say anything about the existence of mass gaps in pure qcd3 and
pure qcd4.
