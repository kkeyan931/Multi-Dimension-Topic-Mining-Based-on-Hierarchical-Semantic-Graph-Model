abstract

we reconsider the problem of nding all local symmetries of a la-

grangian. our approach is completely hamiltonian without any ref-

erence to the associated action. we present a simple algorithm for

obtaining the restrictions on the gauge parameters entering in the

denition of the generator of gauge transformations.

the unravelling of gauge symmetries of a given action is an important

problem which has received much attention in the past. two main ap-

proaches have been followed in the literature: i) the hamiltonian approach

based on diracs conjecture [1, 2], where a suitable combination of the rst

class constraints is shown to be a generator of local symmetries of the la-

grangian, and ii) a purely lagrangian approach, based on techniques used

for discussing dierential equations which are unsolvable with respect to the

highest derivatives [3, 4, 5, 6].

with regard to the hamiltonian approach essentially two dierent pro-

cedures have been followed recently:i) a hybrid approach where one departs

from the requirement of the o-shell invariance of the extended action 4 under

the local symmetry transformations generated by the phase space constraints,

and then imposes a gauge condition whereby all lagrange multipliers asso-

ciated with secondary rst-class constraints vanish [7]; ii) a purely algebraic

approach based on the poisson algebra of gauge generators with the con-

straints and the canonical hamiltonian [8, 9]. in this case the restrictions

on the gauge parameters have been obtained only for a special class of con-

strained systems.

in this paper we present a simple algorithm, based entirely on the to-

tal hamiltonian approach, for obtaining the generator of the most general

symmetry transformation of a given action, without ever making an explicit

reference to the action itself. in order to simplify the discussion, and also

for the sake of comparison, we restrict ourselves in the following to hamilto-

nian systems with only irreducible rst class constraints. the extension to

systems with mixed rst and second class constraints then involves a trivial

step which we shall comment on at the end of this paper.

consider a hamiltonian system of 2n degrees of freedom qi, pi, i = 1 . . . n,

4by extended action we mean the action constructed in terms of the extended hamil-

tonian, in diracs terminology.

described by a canonical hamiltonian hc and a complete and irreducible set

of (rst class) primary constraints a1  0 (a1 = 1,   , r), and secondary

constraints a2  0 (a2 = r + 1,   n), where r is the rank of the hessian as-

sociated with the lagrangian in question. we collect these constraints into a

single vector with components a, a = 1, , n. following diracs conjecture,

we make the following ansatz for the generator of gauge transformation:

g =

n

xa=1

a(t, p, q, v)a

(1)

where, as we shall see, it is in general necessary to allow the gauge parameters

a to depend not only explicitely on time, but also on all phase space variables,

including the lagrange multipliers {va1} (and their time derivatives) entering

in the total hamiltonian,

ht = hc +xa1

va1a1 .

(2)

here hc is the canonical hamiltonian, and {a1  0} are the (rst class)

primary constraints.

an innitesimal gauge transformation of a phase-space function f (q, p)

is then given by

f = [f, a] a

(3)

where a summation over repeated indices is henceforth implied. note that

the gauge parameters appear outside the poisson bracket. in principle we

could have included the gauge parameters inside the poisson bracket. these

dierent denitions are weakly equivalent. as a result of the algebra

[hc, a] = v b

a b

[a, b] = c c

abc

(4)

(5)

this weak equivalence continues to be true for the poisson brackets of f with

either the canonical hamiltonian hc or the generator g. since our analysis

only involves this algebra, it is inconsequential whether the gauge parameters

3

are kept inside or outside the poisson bracket. the structure functions c c

ab

and v b

a can in general depend on the phase space variables.

we now notice that the action principle which leads to the euler-lagrange

equations of motion, requires the commutativity of a general  variation with

the time-dierentiation. this commutativity need not hold for an arbitrary

variation within the hamiltonian framework. since our motivation is to ab-

stract the symmetries of the action, we impose



d
dt

qi =

d
dt

qi

; i = 1, ....n.

(6)

as a fundamental requirement. this, as we now show, turns out to imply a

non trivial condition on the gauge parameters and lagrange multipliers.

as shown by dirac [1], the euler-lagrange equations follow from the

action principle st = 0, where st is dened by

st = z dt[pi qi  ht ]

(7)

moreover, the symmetries of the total action st are also the symmetries of

s = r dtl(q, q), once the hamilton equation of motion for qi, dening the

relation between qi, and the momenta pi as well as lagrange multipliers,

are used to eliminate the momenta and lagrange multipliers in favour of

all the velocities, including the undetermined ones. since we are interested

in the local symmetries of this action, we shall thus work with the total

hamiltonian.

the equations of motion within the hamiltonian framework, are given by,

qi = [qi, ht ] = [qi, hc] + va1[qi, a1]

(8)

and,

pi = [pi, ht ] = [pi, hc] + va1[pi, a1]

together with the constraint equations

a1 = 0

4

(9)

from (8) and (3) we obtain for the left hand side of (6)

 qi = [[qi, hc], a] a + va1 [[qi, a1], b] b + va1 [qi, a1]

(10)

and for the right hand side of the same equation,

d
dt

qi = [[qi, a], hc] a + va1a [[qi, a], a1] + [qi, a]

da
dt

.

(11)

equating both expressions and making use of the jacobi identity, we obtain

[[hc, a], qi] a + va1 [[a1 , a], qi] a  va1[qi, a1] + [qi, a]

da
dt

= 0 . (12)

using (4) and (5), we see that, on the constraint surface {a = 0}, the above

equation implies,

" db

dt

 a[v b

a + va1c b

a1a]# b

pi

 va1 a1
pi

= 0 .

(13)

now, the rst class nature and linear independence (irreducibility) of the

constraints guarantees that each of these can be identied as a momentum

conjugate to some coordinate, the precise mapping being eected by a canon-

ical transformation. since (13) holds for all i one is led to the conditions

vb1 =

0 =

db1
dt
db2
dt

 a[v b1

a + va1c b1

a1a]

 a[v b2

a + va1c b2

a1a]

(14)

(15)

note that in the above equations, da

dt denotes the total time derivative as

given by

da
dt

=

da
dt

+ [a, ht ]

where, following the notation of ref. [7],

d
dt

=


t

+ va1 
va1

+ va1 
 va1

+   .

(16)

(17)

the restrictions on the gauge parameters and the lagrange multipliers

found here are seen to agree with that of ref.[7], obtained by looking at the

5

invariance of the total action considered as the gauge-xed version of the

extended action, dened in terms of the extended hamiltonian

he = hc +x  aa ,

(18)

where the lagrange multipliers { a2} are required to vanish by imposing

suitable gauge conditions. our analysis is also equally applicable to a dy-

namics determined by the extended hamiltonian. the algebra now involves

the full set of (primary and secondary) rst class constraints, so that no con-

dition emerges for the gauge parameters while the variation of the lagrange

multipliers  a is given by

 a =

da
dt

 b[v a

b +  cc a

cb] .

(19)

hence one is free to choose the gauge parameters a to be functions of time

only. these equations again agree with those given in reference [7], as ob-

tained by requiring the invariance of the corresponding extended action.

let us conclude with some comments: our requirement (6) only involved

the relation between the velocities and the canonical momenta and the

arbitrary lagrange multipliers. we have thus only used the rst of hamil-

tons equations, i.e., (8)

contrary to other procedures, our derivation was carried out on a purely

(total) hamiltonian level. as such we could have equally well worked with

gauge transformations in the form,

f = [f, g] = [f, aa]

(20)

because of the rst-class nature of hc and g. however, on the lagrangian

level, the two ways, (3) and (20) of writing the gauge transformation matters,

since it is to be a symmetry also away from the constrained surface. as one

easily checks, by explicitly looking at the o-shell invariance of the action (7),

it is the denition, as given by (3), which leads to the transformation law (14)

for the lagrange multipliers, and conditions (15) on the gauge parameters.

6

finally we emphasize that the same discussion applies to the case where

also second class constraints are present, with the simple replacement of hc

by the rst class operator h (1), dened in the standard way by adding the

contribution of the second class constraints whose lagrange multipliers are

now completely xed.
