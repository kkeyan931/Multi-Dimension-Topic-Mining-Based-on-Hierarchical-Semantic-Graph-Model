abstract

how to gauge x -symmetry for the super 0-brane action on ads2  s2 in killing gauge
properly is discussed in order to nd the superconformal mechanics which describes super
0-brane probes moving on ads2  s2. the dependence on the coordinate frame for the
proper killing gauge is considered and the subtleties of gauge-xing -symmetry in killing

gauge are analysed explicitly. it is found that the killing gauge works indeed without the

imcompatibility if the magnetic charge of the super 0-brane is nonzero.

recently, there has been much interest in the ads/cft correspondence [1], which relates
string theory on adsp+2  sdp 2 to extended superconformal theories in p + 1 dimensions.
in view of the ads/cft conjecture, it is important to understand the formulation of su-

perstrings and super p-branes on these curved spaces. in [2], the type iib green-schwarz
(gs) superstring action was constructed in ads5  s5 background in terms of supercoset
formalism. this action possesses global su(2, 2 | 4) super-invariance, has -symmetry and
2d reparametrization invariance as its local symmetries, and reduces to the conventional

type iib gs superstring action in the at background limit. the other related construc-
tion for gs superstring, super d3-brane, d1-brane on ads5  s5, and super m-branes on
ads4  s7 and ads7  s4 have been discussed in [3]-[8]. the gs superstring and super
p-brane actions on ads3  s3 and ads2  s2 have been constructed in [9] and [10]1. the
gauge-xing of -symmetry was carried out in killing gauge [13] or supersolvable algebra

approach [14, 15]. however, the -symmetry gauge-xing and quantization seem still to pose

some diculties [16, 17, 18]. in [16], it was argued that there is an imcompatibility between
killing gauge and the static vacuum solution for super p-brane actions on adsp+2  sdp 2
superbackgrounds2. since the d3-brane action on ads5  s5 is very complicated [4], while
the super 0-brane action on ads2  s2 was constructed in supercoset formalism [10] only
recently, it is quite interesting to see how the imcompatibility mentioned in [16] appears
explicitly and whether it is possible to simplify the super 0-brane action on ads2  s2 in
killing gauge.

on the other hand, the radial motion of a superparticle with zero angular momentum
near the horizon of an extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole (ads2  s2) is found to be
described by an osp(1 | 2)-invariant superconformal mechanics [19], and it was argued in
[19] that the full superparticle dynamics should be invariant under the larger su(1, 1 | 2)
superconformal group because this is the superisometry group of ads2  s2. this full
dynamics describes not only the radial motion of the superparticle, but also its motion on
s2. in [20], the authors tried to construct a su(1, 1 | 2)-invariant action from the worldline
supereld formalism, but, due to technical diculties, the explicit su(1, 1 | 2)-invariant
1a slightly dierent construction for superstring on ads2  s2 and ads3  s3 was discussed in [11] and

[12].

2as the superstring -symmetry projector is dierent from the reduced d3-brane projector in the static

vacuum solution, such an imcompatibility does not exist for gs superstring.

action has not been obtained. then it is interesting to see how the explicit action, which
describes the super 0-brane dynamics on ads2 s2 with underlying su(1, 1 | 2) invariance3,
is constructed in the bosonic and fermionic coordinates of the super 0-brane.

the purpose of this paper is that we explore the possibility of how to simplify the super
0-brane action on ads2  s2 in killing gauge and avoid the imcompatibility in [16] in order
to nd the super 0-brane action on ads2  s2 with underlying su(1, 1 | 2) invariance
in terms of the bosonic and fermionic coordinates of the super 0-brane. to achieve this
goal, we exploit the super 0-brane action on ads2  s2 built out of the cartan 1-forms
la, la and li [10], which has global su(1, 1 | 2)-invariance, and is invariant under local
-symmetry and one-dimensional reparametrization symmetry. the crucial feature of the
super 0-brane action on ads2  s2 is that it contains two free parameters a and b, which
can be interpreted as the electric and magnetic charges of the super 0-brane. to gauge

x -symmetry in killing gauge [13] and to avoid the imcompatibility [16], we choose the
magnetic charge (b) of the super 0-brane to be nonzero. the 0-brane projector on ads2s2
is given by p = 1
2(ij  0ij ), where the signs depend on the choice of the coordinate
frames. first we consider the killing gauge in the coordinate frame (8) whose killing horizon
is at r =  [19]. we nd that the proper killing gauge is p =  = 0, which makes
r d+)i, thus we can simplify the cartan 1-forms la, la
(m2
and li. if we work in ads coordinates, the situation is reversed, instead of  we have to

f ix)d+ = 0, and (d+)i = ( 

put + = 0 as killing gauge to simplify the cartan 1-forms. the rule is that for a metric
g00  rl, we pick  = 0 if l < 0, but we have to choose + = 0 if l > 0. with the simplied
expression for the cartan 1-forms, the -symmetry gauge xed super 0-brane action on
ads2  s2 is obtained, which can be considered as the supersymmetric generalization of the
action in [19] with underlying su(1, 1 | 2) invariance. to get -symmetry gauge xed super
0-brane action, we have taken the magnetic charge of the super 0-brane to be nonzero. to see

the imcompatibility explicitly, we choose the parameter b = 0 and a > 0, then the classical

static vacuum solution exists. for this static solution the gauge xed super 0-brane action
vanishes, and the -symmetry transformation is reduced to i
the gauge xing should be i

+, which means that
 = 0 in (9), that is, the usual killing gauge
3by underlying su (1, 1 | 2) invariance we mean that upon gauge xing -symmetry, its superconformal

transformations are non-linearly realized on the remaining elds [21, 22].

+ = 0 instead of i

is imcompatiable with the classical static vacuum solution. since in ads coordinates, the

proper gauge xing for -symmetry is + = 0, naively it seems the imcompatibility could

be resolved. however, we nd that in ads coordinates, to make the action (34) vanish in
the static solution (31), we have to choose a = m. then the -symmetry transformation
is changed into i
, which indicates that the gauge xing should be  = 0 instead
of i

+ = 0. thus the imcompatibility between killing gauge and static solution cannot be
smoothed out by a change of the coordinate frame. but when the magnetic charge b is

 = i

nonzero, this imcompatibility can be avoided and the simplication of the super 0-brane
action on ads2  s2 in killing gauge works, since the static vacuum solution does not exist
for b 6= 0. finally the invertibility of the fermionic kinetic operator is discussed, and we
nd that if we choose gauge xing properly for the coordinate e, the killing gauge xing is

acceptable.

now let us consider the super 0-brane action on ads2s2 background described in terms

before gauge xing the -symmetry for the super 0-brane action on ads2s2, we choose

where the killing horizon in these coordinates is at r = . in the following discussion, we
put m = 1 for simplicity, and nally we recover m by dimension analysis.

since the superstring -symmetry projector diers from the d3-brane projector in ads5
[5], and

s5, the killing spinor gauge works for the gs superstring action on ads5  s5
a similar conclusion holds for the gs superstring action on ads2  s2.
argued that there is imcompatibility between killing spinor gauge for the d3-brane action
on ads5  s5 and the static vacuum solution of the d3-brane equation of motion. similarly,
this imcompatibility also exists for the 1-brane action on ads3s3 and for the 0-brane action
on ads2  s2. to make use of the killing spinor gauge and avoid the imcompatibility, we

in [16], it is

4

have to choose the magnetic charge (b) of super 0-brane to be nonzero (the reason will
become clear below). if we dene p = 1
2(ij  0ij ), p = , one may wonder which
component, + or , is put to zero for gauge xing -symmetry in the coordinate frame

(8). even though the projector is indicated by the full 0-brane killing spinor [13, 5], as we

will see below, it is coordinate frame dependent.

in the coordinate frame (8), the proper gauge is

p =  = 0, ij j

+ = 0i

f ix)d+ = 0, which means that all terms of
f ix)d+ for n > 0 vanish. since the coordinate frame (8) possesses the property

we will show that in this gauge we have (m2

(10), one can easily show that if {0, u} = 07, one has

-symmetry has to be taken as  = 0 in order to use (10) and (14) to get m2
f ixd+ = 0.
if we instead choose + = 0 to gauge x the -symmetry, the simplication cannot be

know that the proper gauge xing for -symmetry is

what we learned is that, for a given coordinate frame, the killing gauge xing for -symmetry
is unique: for g00  rl we have to put  = 0 when l < 0, and we should choose + = 0
when l > 0.

to get the superconformal mechanics for the super 0-brane on ads2s2, we consider the
coordiante frame (8). to represent the wz term in (1) as an integral we use the standard
trick of rescaling   s  s,

iw z = iw z(s = 1), siw z(s) = zm2

sh(s)

and

sh(s) = 2(cid:16)aij ilj

where we have used the following equation [10]:

lw z = 2(cid:16)aij lij + bij li 5j(cid:17)

(24)

variating action (30) with respect to the variable , we have   bsin  , which shows that
we can interpret b as the magnetic charge of the super 0-brane.

to get (29), we have assumed the magnetic charge of the super 0-brane to be nonzero.

when we choose the parameter b = 0 and a > 0, we have a = m from (5) and there is

a classical static vacuum solution of the super 0-brane equation of motion following from

(29) [16],

 = t, r = constant,  = constant,  = constant, + = 0.

(31)

for this static solution, the action (29) vanishes (a > 0, b = 0), which is called the no-

force condition, since there is no potential which can push the super 0-brane probe to the

8

boundary of ads2. when a > 0, b = 0, the -symmetry projector is reduced to  = e0
and (2) can be written as

i = (ij + ij 0)j , i

+ = i

+, i

 = 0 ,

(32)

which shows that the gauge xing for -symmetry should be chosen as i
i

+ = 0 instead of
 = 0 in (9), that is, the usual killing spinor gauge is imcompatiable with the classical

static vacuum solution (31) which was rst mentioned in [16].

however, from (21) we know that in ads coordinates (20) the proper gauge xing for
-symmetry is p+ = + = 0. hence we would like to see whether choosing a dierent
coordinate frame could avoid the above imcompatibility. in the ads coordinates (27) yields

(34)

when b = 0, to make the action (34) vanish in the static solution (31), we should choose
a = m. then the -symmetry projector is reduced to  = e0 and (2) turns into

i = (ij  ij 0)j , i

, i

+ = 0 ,

(35)

which indicates that the gauge xing for -symmetry should be i

+ =
0. thus the imcompatibility between the killing gauge and the static solution cannot be

 = 0 instead of i

smoothed out by a change of the coordinate frame. when the magnetic charge b is nonzero,

however, this imcompatibility can be avoided and the above simplication of the super 0-
brane action on ads2  s2 in the killing gauge works, since in this case the static vacuum
solution does not exist.

the invertibility of the fermionic kinetic operator in action (30) can be seen from the

quadratic term in the fermionic part

since a is positive in the coordinate frame (8) with the static gauge  = t, 2 is nonzero,

provided that we choose the gauge xing for e properly. this shows that the killing gauge

xing is acceptable in the above derivation.

up to now, we have obtained the -symmetry gauge xed super 0-brane action on ads2
s2 with underlying su(1, 1 | 2) invariance, which is the supersymmetric generalization of
the action in [19]. if we put + = 0 and b = 0, our bosonic lagrangian is reduced to that

in [19] with a = q. due to the restriction from -symmetry (5), we have m = q, but the

other two cases for m > q and m < q cannot appear from our construction. it seems that

we can add the following term to the wz term in order that we could introduce more free

parameters:

with

lw z  lw z + h

h = aij li(c)c   l j + bsij lic(c )   l j,

where sij = (1,1). one can easily check

d h = 0,
 h = 2d[ aij li

0(  1)j + bsij li

0(1   )j ],

(37)

(38)

(39)

so we can dene a new -symmetry projector. however, when we demand 2 = 1, we have
a = b = 0, that is, we cannot introduce more free parameters to the action in this way.

then it is interesting to see whether it is possible to nd a more general super 0-brane action
on ads2  s2.

in [24] it was observed that the quantum gravity on ads2 is a conformal theory on a strip

which exhibits the symmetries of the virasoro algebra. motivated by [24], the model in [19]

was studied to see if one can nd the generators of the full virasoro algebra [25]. it was

shown that for the model in [19] with one dynamical variable, one can nd generators of the

full virasoro algebra, but the central charge always vanishes. it would be interesting to know

whether there is a way to determine the central charge and normal-ordering conventions for

the present model, and to see whether a non-vanishing central charge could be found for
the gauge-xed super 0-brane model on ads2  s2, which is related to the ads2/cft1
correspondence [24].
