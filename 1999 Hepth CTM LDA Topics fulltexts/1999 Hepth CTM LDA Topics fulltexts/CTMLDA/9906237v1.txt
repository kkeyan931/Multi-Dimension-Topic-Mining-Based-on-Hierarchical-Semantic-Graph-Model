abstract

we compare oscillations of a fundamental string ending on a d3-brane in two dierent

settings: (1) a test-string radially threading the horizon of an extremal black d3-brane and

(2) the spike soliton of the dbi eective action for a d3-brane. previous work has shown

that overall transverse modes of the test-string appear as l = 0 modes of the transverse

scalar elds of the dbi system. we identify dbi world-volume degrees of freedom that have

dynamics matching those of the test-string relative transverse modes. we show that there

is a map, resembling t -duality, between relative and overall transverse modes for the test-

string that interchanges neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions and implies equality

of the absorption coecients for both modes. we give general solutions to the overall

and relative transverse parts of the dbi coupled gauge and scalar system and calculate

absorption coecients for the higher angular momentum modes in the low frequency limit.

we nd that there is a nonzero amplitude for l > 0 modes to travel out to innity along

the spike, demonstrating that the spike remains eectively 3 + 1-dimensional.

1. introduction

the dbi world-volume eld theory of a dp-brane has bps soliton solutions, rst

studied in [1][2][3], that carry both electric and scalar charge. because the world-volume

scalar elds record the spacetime position of the brane, the diverging scalar at the soliton

core means that the surface of the brane has a spike reaching o to innity, as illustrated in

the gure below. both the solitons shape and its electric charge suggest that it represents

a fundamental string ending on the dp-brane. this interpretation is supported [1] by a

matching of the divergent self-energy of the soliton with the mass of a semi-innite string.

in addition it has been shown [4] that coupling of the spike soliton to bulk supergravity

elds yields the neveu-schwarz b eld appropriate to a fundamental string at linear
order.

)

fig. 1: the basic spike soliton. the world-volume r-coordinate vanishes at the
end of the spike, while the spacetime r coordinate goes to innity.

one can probe this correspondence further by studying the dynamics of the dbi spike

soliton [1][5][6][7][8]. in [5] it was shown that for p = 3, 4 the equation governing oscillations

of the spike in directions transverse to the dp-brane world-volume is identical to that for

certain oscillations of a test-string threading the horizon of a dp-brane spacetime.

in

addition to these overall transverse modes, the test-string also has relative transverse

oscillations in directions transverse to the string but tangent to the dp-brane world-volume.

our focus in this paper will be on nding an identication of these relative transverse

modes with degrees of freedom of the dbi spike soliton for the case of the d3-brane.

this task is more complicated than in the overall transverse case, because the relevant

perturbations of the spike soliton involve the coupled gauge and scalar eld dynamics of

the 3 + 1-dimensional dbi system in a nontrivial way, which has no a priori analogue in

the 1 + 1-dimensional test-string system.

1

carrying out the identication requires a detailed understanding of both the test-

string and the coupled world-volume gauge and scalar eld dynamics. as we work through

this material we highlight a number of interesting aspects of both the test-string and dbi

spike soliton systems. for example, in section (2) we note the existence for the test-string

of a map, bearing a striking resemblence to t -duality, that takes overall transverse modes

xinto relative transverse modes y|| and vice-versa. the map implies equality of the
absorption coecients for the two types of modes. another curious feature of the test-
string system is an r  1/r symmetry that exchanges the near horizon and asymptotically
at regions [8]. in the dbi system, we show that such a symmetry continues to hold for all

angular momentum modes and exchanges the at part of the brane with the region down

the spike.

we give low frequency approximations to the absorption coecients for all modes of

both systems. for the dbi system this includes modes carrying nonzero angular momen-

tum. we note that, although suppressed by an angular momentum barrier, the transmis-

sion of these modes down the spike is nonzero. therefore, even though the spike gradually

takes on characteristics of a fundamental string, it remains eectively 3-dimensional all

the way out to innity. the presence of the higher angular momentum modes illustrates

a basic dierence between the dbi spike soliton and spacetime test-string systems.

our main result is an understanding of how the relative transverse modes are manifest

in the dbi system. physically, an oscillation of the spike soliton parallel to the brane looks

like a linearly oscillating charge. therefore, we should expect to see dipole radiation in

both the electromagnetic and scalar elds [8]. we nd that this is indeed the case and

further that the moduli scalars describing the center of mass position of the spike soliton

satisfy the same equation as the test-string relative transverse modes.

2. fluctuating test string in a dp-brane background

we start by deriving the equations of motion for uctuations of a test-string in a

dp-brane background. the string metric for the dp-brane is given by

p) + h 1/2(dr2 + r2d2

8p)  gdxdx.

(2.1)

ds2 = h 1/2(dt2 + . . . + dx2
h = 1 +(cid:16) 

r(cid:17)7p

,

r2 = x2

p+1 + . . . + x2
9.

the nambu-goto area action for the test string is simply s = r d2 det gab, where

gab = axbxg is the induced metric on the worldsheet. note that this string

2

does not couple to the rr gauge eld of the dp-brane. a static string stretching radially

outward in the x9 direction from the dp-brane horizon at r = 0 solves the equations of
motion and we study perturbations around it. choosing static gauge 0 = t and 1 = x9
(implying 1 = r for the radial string), to second order in small uctuations we have

det gab  +1 (cid:8)(txk)2  h 1(rxk)2(cid:9) (cid:8)h(tx)2  (rx)2(cid:9) ,

where k, = 1, .., p and  = p + 1, ..., 8. denoting the overall transverse modes x by x
and the relative transverse modes by y||, the equations of motion for these modes are then
given by

2.1. an analogue of t -duality

by denition, oscillations of the end point of a fundamental string on a dp-brane sat-

isfy neumann boundary conditions for directions along the brane and dirichlet boundary

conditions for perpendicular components. the two types of oscillations are interchanged

by the action of t -duality, which also changes the dimension of the brane.

a priori, the overall and relative transverse modes of the test string x and y|| are
geometrically distinct, probing dierent components of the background spacetime metric.

indeed, as will see below, when equations (2.3) and (2.4) are put in standard scattering

form, the potentials are qualitatively dierent. surprisingly however, there exists a sim-

ple map relating the two types of modes that bears a striking resemblance to t -duality.

specically, making the substitutions

ry|| = h(r)tx,

ty|| = rx

(2.7)

brings equation (2.3) into the form of equation (2.4). this implies, for example, that if x
is a solution of (2.3) with time dependence eit, then y|| = i/rx solves (2.4). note

3

that the map (2.7) interchanges dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions. also note

that, although t -duality changes the dimension of the background brane, because of the

required translation invariance of the lower dimensional brane, the metric function h(r)

remains unchanged.

the relation (2.7) between overall and relative transverse modes implies that the

absorption coecients for the two types of modes are identical. if x and y|| are related
by (2.7), then the corresponding energy uxes f and f|| dened above are equal. the
dimensionless absorption coecient is the ratio of the ux absorbed into the horizon to

the ux incident from innity

 =

fhor
f in


(2.8)

hence the absorption coecients  and || are equal. note that this is an exact statement
about the governing equations (2.3) and (2.4). however, one must keep in mind that the
derivation of these equations from the area action assumes |rx|  a  1, where a is
the amplitude of the wave.

2.2. absorption coecients for x and y||

we now specialize to the case of a test-string ending on a d3-brane and compute
scattering coecients  = ||   for overall and relative transverse waves to be absorbed
into, or reected back from, the horizon [1]. in order to bring equations (2.3) and (2.4)

into standard scattering form, we change to a tortoise coordinate r dened by dr =

ph(r)dr and also rescale the mode wavefunctions according to  = h +1/4x and

|| = h 1/4y||. for fourier modes with time dependence eit, we then have

r  + (2  v(r)) = 0
2
2
r|| + (2  v||(r))|| = 0

where the overall and relative transverse potentials are given by

v = h 1/42

v|| = h +1/42

r(h 1/4) =

r(h 1/4) =(cid:18)54
r6 +

r10(cid:19) h 3

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

the tortoise coordinate r has the asymptotic behavior that r  r for r  , while
r  2/r for r  0. the overall transverse potential v can be seen to fall o rapidly,

4

like r6
 , for both r  . solutions to the overall transverse equation are then well
approximated by plane waves   exp(ir) in both asymptotic regions. therefore,
at long wavelengths, v can be approximated by a delta-function potential. performing
the matching gives the dimensionless absorption coecient (2.8) [1]

 = 4()2

(2.12)

we have demonstrated by means of the t-duality discussed above that this is also the

absorption coecient for the relative transverse waves.

the near horizon limits of x and y|| are suggestive of 3 + 1 dimensional physics.

as the overall transverse wave x approaches the horizon, it has the characteristic 1/r
decay of the spherically symmetric mode of a scalar eld carrying energy o to innity

in a 3 + 1 dimensional space. as we will discuss below, this matches the behavior of the

lowest angular momentum mode for overall transverse oscillations of the 3 + 1 dbi spike
soliton. we also note that, the equation for y||, if regarded as the equation for a radial
function in 3 + 1 dimensions, has a dipole nature. it contains the l(l + 1)/r2
 term with
l = 1. the divergrent asymptotic behavior of the relative transverse waves y|| in (2.14) is
confusing, but note that the energy ux computed from (2.6) remains nite. this behavior
turns out to be appropriate so that y|| may be realized in the dbi spike system as an l = 1
oscillatory mode radiating energy to innity along the d3-brane.

2.3. a curious r  1/r symmetry

we complete this section by noting an interesting symmetry of the overall transverse

wave equation (2.3) [8]. one can check that if x(r) solves (2.3), then so does

x(r) = r x(

2
r

)

(2.15)

in terms of the tortoise coordinate, this property arises from the r  r reection
symmetry of the scattering potential v(r). the mapping (2.15) relates the behavior of
oscillations of the test string in the ads near horizon region to behavior in the asymp-

totically at region. we will return to this symmetry below when analyzing the dbi

modes, where (2.3) is generalized to contain all angular momentum modes, but keeps this

symmetry.

3. fluctuations of the dbi spike soliton

the dbi action for the world-volume degrees of freedom of a d3-brane in a at

background and corresponding equations of motion are given in static gauge by

s =z d4xqdet ( + f ),

  f 2(cid:19) 
(cid:18) 1



 f 

 = 0,

(3.1)

where the greek indices ,  run from 0, . . . , 9. for the d3-brane we divide these into

two sets, directions ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3 tangent to the brane and directions a, b = 4, . . . , 9

transverse to the brane. we then have

f = a  a,

fb = b,

fab = 0,

(3.2)

where a is the world-volume gauge eld and a are the overall transverse scalars.

as shown in [1][2], the dbi theory has bps soliton solutions that represent a collection

of spikes projecting outward from the brane. taking the spikes to point in the 9 direction,
the solitonic gauge and scalar elds are related via f 0
 = 9, and the equations of
motion reduce to 29 = 0. for a single spike at the 3 + 1 dimensional origin, we have
9 = q/r.

the spike soliton represents a fundamental string ending at an electric charge on the
d3-brane. strictly speaking the string meets the d3-brane only at r = 0, 9 =  [9].
the spike itself has properties which interpolate between those of the d3-brane proper

and those of the string. for example, as we will see below, the spike remains eectively

3 + 1 dimensional even as it narrows near the origin. on the other hand, when coupled

to the bulk spacetime elds, the spike acts as a source for the components of the ns

anti-symmetric tensor eld appropriate to a fundamental string [4].

here we will catalogue all the uctuating modes of the dbi spike soliton and identify

the particular modes which correspond to the oscillations of the test string described
in section 2. note that in the dbi coordinates above r  0 is going down the spike
to what corresponds to the asymptotically at region in the spacetime (r  ). let

yield a system of four equations corresponding to dierent values for the free index  =

0, k, a, 9, where k = 1, 2, 3 and a = 4, . . . , 8. the overall transverse modes a decouple

from the other elds and satisfy the equation

2a  h(r)2

0a = 0,

(3.4)

where h(r) = 1 + q2/r4. the remaining elds give a coupled maxwell-scalar eld system,

(3.5)

where ek = f0k, fkl = klmbm, fka = ka, and fk9 = k. note that for
h(r) = 1 (q = 0), these equations reduce to the decoupled maxwell and transverse scalar
equations.

in order to untangle equations (3.5) for the coupled gauge and scalar eld system, it
is useful to dene the combination ~v = ~e  ~. fourier transform in time, or alternatively
consider only an overall time dependence eit. in terms of ~v, the equations of motion

and the bianchi identities may be rewritten as the set (see also [7])

2~v + 2 h(r)~v = 0,

~  ~v = 2,

2 + 2 h(r) = ~v  ~ h(r)

i ~b = ~  ~v
~  ~b = i(cid:16)~ + h(r)~v(cid:17)
~  ~b = 0.

(3.6a)

(3.6b)

(3.6c)

(3.6d)

(3.6e)

(3.6f)

note that the wave equation for each cartesian component vk is the same as the equation

(3.4) for the transverse scalars a. given a solution of (3.6a) for ~v, solutions for the

remaining elds may be determined in the following simple way. let ~v be a solution to

(3.6a), then  is given by the right hand side of the gauss law constraint (3.6b). the

dynamical equation (3.6c) for  is then satised as a consequence of (3.6a). given ~v, the
world-volume magnetic eld ~b is determined by the dynamical equation (3.6d). equation

7

(3.6f ) is then identically satised, while equation (3.6e) follows from the equations above.
finally, the world-volume electric eld is found from via the denition ~e = ~v  ~.
follows. each cartesian component of ~v can be expanded as vk = p ak

the full set of independent solutions to the system (3.6) can then be enumerated as
lmylm()pl(r),
where the functions pl(r) satisfy a radial equation which follows from (3.6a). the scalar 
and the magnetic eld ~b are then determined as described above in terms of pl(r) and are
indexed by angular momentum mode l. as we will see below, the multipole composition

of the full solution for a given value of l is actually of a mixed nature.

both the overall transverse equation (3.4) and the relative transverse system (3.6)

transverse modes a we have

e =

~f =   ~,

~fv = ( h(r)  1) ~v,

~feb = ~e  ~b.

(3.7)

(3.8)

3.1. overall transverse fluctuations

in order to write down the most general solution to the overall transverse wave

equation (3.4), we decompose the scalars  in terms of spherical harmonics,  =

p almylm(, )pl(r), where alm are constant coecients. the radial equation follow-

ing from (3.4) is then given by

1

r2 r(r2rpl) +(cid:18)2 h(r) 

l(l + 1)

r2 (cid:19) pl = 0,

(3.9)

which as r   reduces to the usual helmholtz radial equation. if we work instead in
terms of the radial coordinate r = q/r, then this becomes

2

rpl +(cid:18)2 h(r) 

l(l + 1)

r2 (cid:19) pl = 0,

r =

q
r

.

(3.10)

for l = 0, as noted in [5], this is the same as the equation (2.3) governing overall transverse
oscillations of a test-string in a d3-brane background, provided that the parameter q2 that

8

species the charge of the spike soliton is identied with the parameter 4 from the d3-
brane metric. the quantity 4 is proportional to the adm mass per unit volume of the

d3-brane spacetime (2.1), which is in turn proportional to the d3-brane tension t3. the
dbi charge q is proportional the the tension of the attached fundamental string t1. the
equality q2 = 4 then requires t3  t 2
1 , a result discussed in [10] that follows from duality
arguments involving alternate dimensional reductions of m-branes.

we are also interested in the l > 0 modes of the transverse scalars. while the l = 0

modes of the overall transverse dbi scalars can be indentied with overall transverse modes

of the test-string, the higher l modes present in the dbi system have no obvious analogue

amongst excitations of the test-string. from equation (3.9) one might think that the higher

l modes are suppressed as they propagate down the spike towards r = 0. however, a closer

analysis shows that, although there is the usual angular momentum suppression, l > 0

modes can in fact propagate out to innity along the spike.

two additional forms of the radial equation are useful for this analysis. in terms of

the rescaled radial function fl = rpl equation (3.9) becomes

2

r fl +(cid:18)2h(r) 

l(l + 1)

r2 (cid:19) fl = 0,

fl = rpl.

(3.11)

finally, making use of the d3-brane spacetime tortoise coordinate r dened via dr =

ph(r)dr and rescaling the radial function according to pl = h 1/4l gives

(3.12)

2

r l +(cid:18)2 

l(l + 1)

h(r)r2  v(cid:19) l = 0,

where r is regarded as a function of r and the potential v is given in equation (2.9).
equation (3.12), like its l = 0 case (2.9), is invariant under the reection r  r, which
interchanges the at part of the brane near r =  with the region far down the spike near
r = 0. both the scattering potential v and the angular momentum barrier in (3.12)
are symmetric about the mouth of the spike. an l-mode with a given initial amplitude

may be started at either end, and the subsequent propagation is the same in either case.

in appendix a below, we show that the dimensionless absorption coecient for modes of

arbitrary angular momentum l is given in the low energy limit by

l  |cl|2

|al|2 

4(q)4l+2

l2,

(3.13)

where l is a numerical constant given in the appendix. we see that although the absorption

of l > 0 modes is indeed supressed by higher powers of the frequency , there is no absolute

9

barrier to transmission down the spike. the spike remains functionally 3 + 1 dimensional

all the way out to innity.

we are left with two questions. what is the analogue, if any, of the l 6= 0 dbi modes in
the test string picture? and, does the dbi spike soliton actually include a 1+1 dimensional

string, or just the attachment point of the string? one possibility is that to include the

string, one must add the string action to the dbi 3-brane action, and nd solutions of the

combined system. the string would then be attached at the end of the spike. conversely,

the test string in the d3-brane spacetime approximation does not include the smooth

transition mouth region, which then misses the higher l modes.

finally, these dbi modes also display the symmetry that for the test-string relates the

physics in the near horizon anti-desitter region to that in the asymptotically at region.

in the dbi system, the relation is between the region down the spike and the at region

of the brane. note that (3.11) and (3.10) are the same equation, so that there is a kind of
r  q/r symmetry in the transverse scalar wave equation. precisely, if fl(r) is a solution
to (3.11), then pl(r) = rfl(q/r) is also a solution. this generalizes the symmetry of the
spacetime totally transverse modes (2.15)to all l.

3.2. relative transverse modes

there is no direct match among the dbi world-volume elds for the test-string relative

transverse degrees of freedom y||. however, the physical picture is clear [8]. the string ends
in an electric charge on the d3-brane world-volume, and relative transverse oscillations of

the string result in oscillations of the end point. since the oscillating end point carries both

electric and scalar charge, we expect to get both scalar and electromagnetic radiation.

in the overall transverse case, only the l = 0 mode of the world-volume scalars corre-

sponded to the test-string degrees of freedom, and this will also be the case for the relative

transverse modes. as discussed above, a solution to the relative transverse system of equa-

tions (3.6) can be specied in terms of a solution of (3.6a) for ~v. solutions to the system

specied by the l = 0 modes of ~v, we will see, match the relative transverse modes of the

test-string. we will also see that these modes arise via oscillations of the moduli of the

spike soliton corresponding to its center of mass position.

to illustrate more generally the behavior of the maxwell-scalar system (3.6), we will
give three examples, having l = 0, 1, 2 and absorption coecients that go like (q)4l+2
as q  0. these describe the analogue of the spacetime relative transverse oscillations,

a dilation of the charge source, and an oscillating electric dipole respectively.

10

there are three independent l = 0 modes corresponding to the dierent components of

~v (see also the discussion in [8]). taking, for example, a wave polarized in the z-direction,

we have

vx = vy = 0,

vz = p0(r).

(3.14)

following the steps described above, the other world-volume elds are then given by

(3.15)

where hatted indices indicate components in an orthonormal frame. we can now compute
the ux of radiation ~f|| for this solution using the expressions in (3.8). the two con-
tributions ~f and ~fv each individually diverge as r approaches zero, down the spike.
however, their sum is nite. we nd

(3.16)

which shows that while radiation in the individual elds exhibits a dipole pattern, the

total radiated energy ux is isotropic. we also see explicitly that the total radiated ux

is identical to that in the totally transverse case, as expected because the solution for

the various elds is given in terms of the single function p . this further implies that

the absorption coecient for the l = 0 relative transverse dbi excitation is equal to the

absorption coecient for the test string relative transverse mode, using the identity of the

two totally transverse systems, and the equality  = || for the test string absorbtion
coecients. in fact we have now established on of our main results, the equality of all

the absorption coecients for the l = 0 modes of the dbi system with the modes of the

test-string

dbi|| = dbi = st || = st   4(q)2,

(3.17)

where the last relation follows from equation (3.13) and equating q2 = 4 as discussed

above.

11

the dynamical degrees of freedom of the test string and dbi relative transverse modes
appear quite dierent. for the test string, there are simply the three scalars y k
|| , while in
the dbi system the dynamics are described by the coupled ~e, ~b and  elds. to see how
the degrees of freedom y k

|| arise in the dbi system [8], consider perturbations of the spike

soliton in which the moduli of the spike vary,

9 =

|~x  ~x(t, xi)|

.

the scalar eld  is then given by

  9 =

q~x  ~x
|~x|3

.

(3.18)

(3.19)

we note here that in fact the spike position moduli xi satisfy the same equation (2.4) as

the relative transverse modes of the test-string. for example, choosing x = y = 0 yields
 = qzcos
which in turn implies that vk is of the form assumed in (3.14). therefore,
z is given by the function z = r2
0(r). two further dierentiations then yield the
result that z indeed satises equation (2.4). note nally that ~v and ~b can be found
using p0 =  q
r2 h(r)z, so that the full set of elds is determined by the the behavior of
the spike modulus z.

3.3. higher l modes

we close this section by presenting two higher l solutions to the relative transverse

dbi system (3.6). the rst is the spherically symmetric mode of ~v, which is actually the
l = 1 mode of the relative transverse system. take vk = xk
vr = p1, v = v = 0. the remaining elds are then determined to be

r p1(r) which is equivalent to

we see that this mode is a spherically symmetric oscillation of the charged region. there

is therefore no electromagnetic radiation, however there is radiation in the scalar eld 

with a total ux having the same form as (3.16)

using (3.21) and the expression for the absorption coecients in (3.13) we have for this
mode 1 = 4

our nal example is very similiar to the oscillating dipole in standard e&m (see e.g,

[11]). take ~v to be a generalization of a dipole3

vr = 2cosp2(r),

v =

p2(r),

v = 0

(3.22)

this is equivalent to taking the cartesian components vk proportional to the radial function

p2(r) times linear combinations of the spherical harmonics y20, y2,1. the scalar eld 
then has a dipole form, there is dipole radiation in the electromagnetic elds, and the
radial component of ~e is asymptotically of the same form as in [11]:

appendix a. scattering coecients

in this appendix we derive the low energy absorption coecients for all modes of

the dbi system. recall that the radial equation (3.10) governs both overall transverse
oscillations and the oscillations of each component vk in the relative transverse dbi systems

3 recall that this is all in fourier space, so there are also implicit oscillating factors

13

(as well as the overall transverse test-string modes). the radial equation (3.10) is put in

standard scattering form in (3.12) by using the tortoise coordinate dr =ph(r)dr and
the rescaled wavefunction  = h 1/4p . note that this implies that the region down the
spike is r, r  , while the at part of the d3-brane is r  , r  0 and that the
angular momentum term in (3.12) falls o like l(l + 1)/r2
 as r  . the potential v
falls o like 1/r6
 at either end, implying that solutions to (3.12) are well approximated in

terms of bessel functions at the two ends. we can then write

the strategy for calculating the absorption coecients for the dierent l modes is to
expand pl,spike and pl,out for small |r| and patch them together using the  = 0 solution
valid in a middle region. recall that  = h 1/4. using the asymptotic forms of the

hankel functions and the toroise coordinate we then get the expansions
