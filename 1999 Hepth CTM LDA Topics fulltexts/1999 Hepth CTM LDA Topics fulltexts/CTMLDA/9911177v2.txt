abstract:

we study the thermodynamics of the 2+1 dimensional gross-neveu model by introducing
a representation for the canonical partition function which encodes both real and imaginary
chemical potential cases. it is pointed out that the latter case probes the thermodynamics of
possible anyon-like excitations in the spectrum. it is also intimately connected to the breaking
of the discrete z-symmetry of the model, which we interpret as signaling anyon deconnement.
finally, the chiral properties of the model in the presence of an imaginary chemical potential are
discussed and analytical results for the free-energy density at the transition points are presented.

1 introduction

chiral symmetry and its realization at nite temperature have been matter of intense studies
for a long time. one of the most extensively used laboratories for this purpose has been the
gross-neveu model [1] both at zero and nite temperature [2][3]. in the large-n limit the 2 + 1
dimensional version of this theory is renormalizable and provides a convenient arena for the
survey of chiral symmetry; for instance, its dynamical breakdown at zero temperature and its
high temperature restoration. recently, there has been also considerable interest in studying
the properties of chiral symmetry at nite density, or equivalently in the presence of a chemical
potential [46]. this is believed to be relevant to the understanding of the physics of hot and
dense matter which is expected to be probed in the laboratory by the rhic experiments [7].

in this work, we address the thermodynamics and chiral properties of the 2+1 dimensional
gross-neveu model in the canonical formalism. the use of the canonical formalism follows
naturally when one introduces a constraint on the fermion number. our discussion, however,
will be based on a generalized representation of the canonical partition function that encodes
the presence of a real chemical potential as a special case.
it is shown that the approach
yields similar results to the grand canonical formalism outcomes, the latter being the natural
framework for studying systems in the presence of a chemical potential [8, 9]. this generalized
partition function will also be studied for imaginary values of the chemical potential where it
corresponds, rather surprisingly, to a real free-energy density. 5

we argue that the presence of an imaginary chemical potential is intimately connected to
the possibility of having anyon-like excitations in the spectrum of the theory. we also show that
the imaginary chemical potential emerges naturally in the 2+1 dimensional gross-neveu u (1)
gauged model at nite temperature. such a theory has innitely many z-vacua [13] around
which the gauge eld may uctuate. these uctuations have been shown to be connected to
peculiar excitations whose charge is not an integer multiple of the elementary charge of the
theory. we interpret these excitations as being anyon-like [14] and argue that our generalized
canonical partition function gives their free-energy density. as the gauge eld uctuations
around the z-vacua lead to the spontaneous breakdown of the discrete z-symmetry, it appears
that the latter is tied to an anyon connement/deconnement transition. finally, we study the
chiral properties of the gross-neveu model in the presence of an imaginary chemical potential.
in this case the theory is chirally symmetric at high enough temperatures but it appears to be
unstable at t = 0. for any non-zero value of the imaginary chemical potential, chiral symmetry
is broken at a certain temperature as the system cools down. this corresponds to a second-order
phase transition where the free-energy density of the system is given by a remarkably simple
analytic expression. there also exists a particular value of the temperature at which the system

5the study of the thermodynamics of fermionic systems in the presence of an imaginary chemical potential
has been considered in the past [10, 12, 11]. such studies, however, have been primarily focused on the technical
virtues of the imaginary chemical potential formalism in lattice simulations.

appears to be in a bosonic phase.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec.2 we briey review the 2+1 dimensional gross-
neveu model at nite temperature. in sec.3 we set the stage for studying the model with a
constraint on the fermion number. using a generalization of the well-known formula which gives
the canonical partition function [10, 12, 11] we derive analytic expressions for the free-energy
density, the fermion number density and the chiral order parameter. our formalism coincides
with the standard grand-canonical approach when the chemical potential takes real values. in
sec.4 we study the model in the presence of an imaginary chemical potential and show that it
corresponds to a system possessing anyon-like excitations. we establish a connection with the
breakdown of the z-symmetry [13] of the u (1) gauged gross-neveu model at nite temperature.
in this way we give a physical interpretation to the canonical partition function with imaginary
chemical potential as representing the free-energy needed to immerse an excitation of imaginary
charge in the spectrum. we argue that such excitations are anyon-like. next, we present results
related to the properties of chiral symmetry in the presence of an imaginary chemical potential
at nite temperature. in sec.5 we summarize and discuss possible implications of our results.

(2)

this model has been extensively used as a testing ground for studying the mechanism of chiral
symmetry breaking in qcd [6].

for large-n , the model is studied in a 1/n expansion where it is renormalizable [15]. one
introduces an auxiliary scalar eld (x) and integrates the fermions out. the partition function
(generating functional) reads

z = z (d)en ief f (,g) ,

6for the euclidean gamma matrices we use the hermitean representation i =

where the rescaled coupling g = gn is kept nite as n  .

to leading order in 1/n the renormalized theory manifests itself in two dierent phases
distinguished by a zero or a non-zero expectation value of hi. this manifestation depends
on the value of the renormalized coupling 1/gr as compared to the critical coupling 1/g =
4(2)3r d3p/p2. for 1/gr > 1/g, hi = 0 and the theory is in a weakly-coupled phase
where chiral symmetry is unbroken. for 1/gr < 1/g, hi 6= 0 and the theory is in a strongly-
coupled phase where chiral symmetry is broken. in the latter case the fermions acquire a mass
proportional to hi. clearly, hi plays the role of an order parameter for the chiral phase
transition.

from the euclidean formulation above one straightforwardly switches over to thermodynam-
ics at temperature t = 1/ by making x0 nite with length l = 1/t 7 and imposing periodic
(antiperiodic) boundary conditions over the interval [0, l] for bosonic (fermionic) variables. in
this way the bulk theory in 2+1 dimensions corresponds to a two-dimensional quantum system
at zero temperature. it then follows that the t = 0 system can be prepared, by appropriately
tuning the coupling constant, to be either in the chirally symmetric or in the chirally broken
phase. had it been prepared to be in the broken (ordered) phase, one would expect that
there exists a high temperature phase transition to the symmetric (disordered) phase. such a
transition is allowed (not forbidden) by the mermin-wagner-coleman theorem as the relevant
symmetry is discrete. 8

to study the chiral symmetry restoration one calculates the partition function (3) by the
steepest descent method for large-n . this amounts to performing a 1/n expansion for z around
its saddle-points, which correspond to uniform values of hi. the latter are obtained from the
gap equation

this expression is divergent but all uv divergences at nite temperature are the same as at zero

renormalized value at t = 0. for the system to be in the chirally broken phase at t = 0 one

8compare this situation to the 2+1 dimensional o(n ) vector model [16, 17]. in that case, the bulk theory
again corresponds to a two-dimensional quantum system at t = 0 which can be in either an o(n )-symmetric
phase or an o(n )-broken phase. however, the t > 0 theory can only be in the o(n )-symmetric phase as the
relevant o(n ) symmetry is continuous and cannot be broken in d = 2.

3 thermodynamics of the 2+1 dimensional gross-neveu model in the canon-

ical formalism

3.1 general setting

the canonical formalism for the analysis of the thermodynamics of a system has been recently
employed in studies of fermionic systems at nite baryon density [11, 12]. the reason is that
it bypasses the usual sign problem of the euclidean fermion determinant for real values of
the chemical potential. since the three-dimensional gross-neveu model does not undergo this
sign problem, it has been extensively studied in the standard grand-canonical formalism both
analytically and numerically [4, 5]. nevertheless, it would still be interesting to perform a direct
analysis in the canonical formalism in order to test results obtained previously. furthermore, in
doing so, we obtain some surprising new results which shed new light into the thermodynamics
of the model.

the canonical partition function can be obtained as the thermal average over eigenstates of

the number operator n =r d2x (, x)(, x) with xed eigenvalues b. namely, [8]

z(t, v, b) = t r(cid:16)e h ( n  b)(cid:17) ,

(9)

where h is the hermitian hamiltonian. as usual, n measures the excess of fermions over
anti-fermions in the spectrum.

if one anticipates that for certain physical conditions the spectrum contains free fermions or
anti-fermions, then b must be an integer. this then leads to the following representation for
the canonical partition function [10]

9in our calculations we always normalize the free-energy density in such a way that it vanishes in the bulk, i.e.

z(t, v, b) =

1

2 z 2

0

d eibz(t, v, i) ,

(10)

at t=0 [18].

5

where, z(t, v, i) is the grand-canonical counterpart with imaginary chemical potential. if on
the other hand one is interested in physical situations where b is the mean fermion (anti-fermion)
density, then b is real, not necessarily integer, and (10) is no more a valid representation.

in this work we propose a generalization of eq.(10) which is suitable for both analytic
and numerical work. our representation includes both cases of integer and non-integer real
values of b. furthermore, it leads to some unexpected new results when b is imaginary. our
representation follows from eq.(9) if we write the delta-function constraint with the help of an
auxiliary lagrange multiplier scalar eld ( ) as

z(t, v, b) = z (d)(d)en ief f (,g;,b)

= ef (t,v,b),

(11)

which enforces the averaged fermion number constraint h ni = b. here, f (t, v, b) is the free-
energy and ief f is the following eective action

(12)
to evaluate the free-energy in (11) for large-n , we expand ief f around its stationary points
assuming constant (translation invariant) hi and hi congurations. these satisfy the following
set of saddle-point equations 10

[20, 19]. we can subtract the uv divergences in
eq.(13) [19] by adjusting the renormalized coupling as in (6). at the same time the system at
t = 0 can be arranged so as to break chiral symmetry. after some algebra we obtain

the functions lin(z) are the standard polylogarithms [21].

in principle, the free-energy density (17) together with the gap equations (15) and (16) are
sucient for studying the thermodynamic properties of the gross-neveu model to leading-n .
before we proceed, however, we observe that requiring the free-energy density in (17) to be real
we are naturally led to distinguish two cases. namely, as the terms involving polylogarithms
in (17) are real for both real and imaginary values of hi, we can have either 1) hi=imaginary
and b=real, or 2) hi=real and b=imaginary. clearly, 1) would correspond to the usual case
of the gross-neveu model with real chemical potential. nevertheless, we will show that case 2)
probes some interesting properties of the gross-neveu model too.

3.2 relation to the grand-canonical formalism

for hi=imaginary (17) is the free-energy density of the gross-neveu model with ordinary
indeed, setting ihi =  < m we nd that (15) and (16) coincide
(real) chemical potential.
with the corresponding expressions for the gap equation and the fermion density, the latter was
obtained for the rst time in [5]. namely,

(18)

(19)

the thermodynamic properties here are well-known. as the chemical potential  increases from
zero, the critical temperature tc for the chiral symmetry restoration decreases. this critical
temperature becomes zero at some critical value of the chemical potential c  m where the
chiral symmetry restoration is of rst order. one can draw a physical picture of the chiral
symmetry restoration in terms of overlapping composites. when the temperature is increased,
chiral condensates begin to overlap as their radius grow up. at some critical point the system is
mainly composed of overlapping condensates which, as a result, are no longer the good basis for
describing the thermodynamic properties of the system and the fermionic constituents must be
taken into account. it is then reasonable to expect that by increasing the baryon density, which
amounts to increasing the density of chiral condensates, a lower critical temperature would be
needed for the system to reach the critical point above. in fig.1 we plot the critical lines in the
hi- plane for various values of t . in fig.2 we plot hi vs t for various values of . in fig. 3
we plot the fermion density b/n vs t for various values of . for  > 0 the fermion density is
discontinuous at a critical temperature tc().

4 imaginary chemical potential

4.1 the connection with an anyon-like system (anyon connement/deconnement)

consider the interaction of the gross-neveu model (1) with an external u (1) gauge potential

a(x). the euclidean lagrangian density reads

l =  i(/  ie/a)i 

( ii)2,

g
2

(20)

where e is the electric charge. let us consider a constant potential a0   along the time
direction. we can imagine embedding the model above into a 4-dimensional space. due to
the nite length of the x0 dimension and the antiperiodic boundary conditions of the fermions
along it, the system may be viewed as existing in a 3-dimensional hyper-cylinder whose axis
is the 4th (unobservable) dimension. the constant potential a0 may now be regarded as the
vector potential generated by a thin solenoid of magnetic ux  = l along the axis of the
hyper-cylinder. such a picture corresponds to fermions encircling a thin solenoidal magnetic
ux and one might expect to encounter aharonov-bohm type phenomena [14].

the potential in (20) may be gauged away by the transformation

  eie  .

(21)

such a transformation, however, twists the antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions
unless

 =

2
el

k , k = 0  1,2, . . . .

(22)

the congurations with twisted boundary conditions may be viewed as anyon-like excitations
[14]. for instance, the quasi-particle propagator of the above model (20)

s(x0, x; a0,hi) = (/ + ie0a0 + hi)s0(x0, x; a0,hi) ,
has the following representation as a sum over non-trivial topological paths

s0(x0, x; a0,hi) =



xl=

eil ei(ll+x0)ea0(x0 + ll, x;hi) ,

(23)

(24)

where (x0, x;hi) are free boson propagators of mass hi. furthermore, since in our generalized
representation of the partition function (11) we imposed a constraint on the average fermion
number, we can have local charge density uctuations b(, x) which give rise to the so-called
statistical gauge eld a(, x) as

b(, x) = (, x)(, x)  b = 1a2(, x)  2a1(, x) = 0ijiaj(, x) .

(25)

this (non-dynamical) eld would be responsible for the anyon dynamics [22]. finally, the
partition function of the free theory i.e (20) at g = 0, has been shown to reproduce the standard
anyon virial coecients [23].

8

the existence of the anyonic excitations above may be tied to a discrete z-symmetry of
the 2+1 dimensional gross-neveu model interacting with a standard u (1) gauge eld a(x) at
temperature t . the partition function in this case is

z = z (da)(d)(d )ert [ 1

4 f f  i(/ie/a)i g

2 ( ii)2],

where f = [a] as usual. this theory is invariant under

a(, x)  a(, x) + (, x) ,
(, x)  eie(,x)(, x) ,
(, x)  (, x)eie(,x) ,

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

which are the usual small gauge transformations provided they are periodic in euclidean time 

(0, x) = (l, x) and (0, x) = (l, x) .

(30)

in addition to these, the theory is also invariant under large gauge transformations which are
given by

(0, x) = (l, x) +

k , k = 1,2, . . . .

(31)

and represent a global z-symmetry. this symmetry implies the existence of innitely many
equivalent z-vacua in the theory (26). namely, the gauge eld congurations

az

 (, x) = (

2
el

k, 0, 0), k = 0,1,2, . . . ,

(32)

are lowest energy and equivalent since they are connected by gauge transformations of the
form (, x) = (2/el) . still, such z-transformations preserve the anti-periodic boundary
conditions. we therefore conclude that eq.(32) represents equivalent vacuum congurations of
(26).

going back to (20) provided condition (22) holds, the theory can be interpreted as a gross-
neveu model with a u (1) gauge coupling at nite temperature and lying in one of the z-vacua.
in this case there exist no anyon-like excitations in the spectrum. if condition (22) is relaxed,
then (20) corresponds to the gauge theory above where the gauge eld uctuates around the
z-vacua. in the latter case there exist anyon-like excitations in the spectrum.

we can now construct an order parameter to distinguish the two cases as follows. consider

translational invariant uctuations around the z-vacua in (26) such that

(33)

(0) = (l).

take now the quantity

hpei = heier l

0

d ( )i,

where e/e 6= integer and the average is taken with respect to the partition function (26). it
is not dicult to see that (34) is invariant under the strictly periodic gauge transformations

(30). it is not invariant, however, under the z-transformations (31). to see this consider the
transformations

( )  ( ) +

k , k = 1,2, . . . ,

2
el

(35)

(36)

which are symmetries of the theory (26) provided there is z-invariance. under (35)

hpei  ei2k e

ehpei 6= hpei.

the physical interpretation of (34) is that fe = (1/) lnhpei gives the free-energy necessary to
immerse a conguration of charge e in the spectrum of the system [3]. if the theory (26) is in a
z-vacuum, then the spectrum can contain only an integer number of fermions or antifermions
since, as explained earlier, it does not contain anyon-like excitations. in this case one clearly
expects that fe =  or hpei = 0. if on the other hand the theory is not in a z-vacuum, then
there exist anyon-like congurations in the spectrum and one in general expects that hpei 6= 0.
we conclude that, in this sense, the z-symmetry of the full gauge theory (26) is connected to
the connement or screening of anyons, where hpei is the relevant order parameter. the
anyonic theory preserves z-symmetry in the conned phase where hpei = 0 and violates the
z-symmetry in the deconned phase where hpei 6= 0.

we are now in a position to give a physical interpretation to the partition function (11) with

real hi (imaginary chemical potential), as a result of the following identity 11

z(t, v, b) = ef (t,v,b)  hp b/ni .

(37)

namely, the free-energy of the gross-neveu model with imaginary chemical potential represents
the free-energy of anyon-like congurations emerging in the spectrum when the model is coupled
to a u (1) gauge eld which uctuates around the z-vacua.

the above discussion concerning the order parameter (34) parallels the discussion in [13] of
a similar order parameter for the connement or screening of incommensurate charges in parity
invariant qed3 (see also [24]). one of the new observations here is the interpretation of the
incommensurate charged congurations as being anyon-like. another important point is that
the order parameter hpei is in fact imaginary for any real value of e. this is also seen from (17)
or (37). if (34) is to be interpreted as a physical free-energy density, it is necessary that e is
imaginary. the fact that we obtain an imaginary eigenvalue b = e for the hermitian operator
n means essentially that we are not using a positive denite density matrix to describe the
uctuations around the z-vacua of the theory (26). nevertheless, even in that case we will be
able to extract useful results for the critical properties of the theory, assuming that the latter
are universal.

11here we use e = 1.

10

4.2 chiral symmetry and z-vacua

the chiral symmetry restoration for real hi can be inferred from the gap equation (15). the
critical line separating the chirally symmetric from the chirally broken phase in the hi-t plane
is obtained by setting hi = 0 in (15) as

hi =

1
l

arccos" elm

2  1# ,

(38)

and is depicted for various values of m in fig.4 when hi/t  [0, ].

in order to discuss the chiral properties of the theory we shall henceforth consider, for
concreteness, the massless case where the system is critical already at t = 0. in this case, when
the chemical potential is real one does not expect any phase transition as the temperature rises
up. to put it dierently and in a more general ground, for real chemical potential the system is
chirally symmetric at some high temperature and as it cools down chiral symmetry is, in general,
broken at some lower critical temperature. having chosen m = 0 this critical temperature is
t = 0. consider now the case when hi is real, where this corresponds to an imaginary chemical
potential or some uctuation around the z-vacua as explained above. again, at high enough
temperatures we expect the system to be chirally symmetric. however, chiral symmetry is now
broken at a non-zero temperature t = 3hi/2. the important point is that as the system cools
down, chiral symmetry remains broken in a temperature window 3hi/2  t  3hi/4 and
then it is restored again. furthermore, as t  0, it passes through innitely many windows
of the form

, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(39)

in which chiral symmetry is always broken. this essentially means that for any real non-zero
hi the t = 0 theory becomes unstable. the relevant physical picture can be read o from fig.5
where we plot hi/t vs hi/t in 0  m/t  2 ln 2. note that for m/t > 2 ln 2 the theory is
always in a chirally broken phase.

we can draw a physical picture for the chiral symmetry restoration discussed above. the
magnetic ux (25) associated with local charge uctuations catalyzes symmetry breaking as it
stabilizes the chiral condensates against thermal uctuations inside the temperature windows
(39) 12. the fact that in the high-temperature weakly coupled regime even a small imaginary
chemical potential induces chiral symmetry breaking, shows that the former plays the role of
a strong catalyst of dynamical symmetry breaking, similar to that of a transverse external
magnetic eld [25] or a constant negative curvature [26]. the chiral symmetry restoration
transition at t = 3hi/2 is of the second-order with mean eld critical exponents [14, 20] since
the order parameter hi is continuous. the order parameter acquires its maximum value for

qed recently discussed in [27].

t = hi/ and then starts to drop until it reaches zero again at t = 3hi/4. the same picture
holds for all chiral restoration temperature windows (39).

it is also interesting to study the behavior of the free-energy density as a function of the
temperature for non-zero hi. this is depicted in fig.6 where we plot the free-energy density vs
hi/t . for high enough t the system is in the chirally symmetric phase and to leading-n the
free-energy density equals that of n massless free four-component dirac fermions e.g. eq.(8).
at t = 3hi/2 the free-energy jumps discontinuously to a local minimum and then raises until
it reaches a local (positive) maximum at t = 3hi/4 where it drops again discontinuously to
the value (8). similar uctuations occur for all the innitely many temperature windows (39)
as t  0.

it is rather intriguing that we are able to give analytic expressions for the free-energy density
of the system at the end-points of the temperature windows of chiral symmetry breaking,
3hi/2, 3hi/4 (in fact this is possible for the end-point of all the windows (39)). after
some algebra we obtain respectively

where, cl2() = im[li2(ei)] is the clausen function [21]. note that cl2(/3) is the absolute
maximum of this function which is a well-documented irrational number [28].

the results for the free-energy density have been on purpose written as above, in order to be
compared with the expected scaling form of the free-energy density of a conformal eld theory
(cft). the point is that the chiral phase transition in the 2+1 dimensional model above is of
second-order and one would expect it to correspond to the universality class of a 3-dimensional
cft. when a cft is put in a nite-size geometry (i.e.
in a slab with one nite dimension of
length l), its free-energy density scales as [18]

fl = 

c (3)
2l3 

(42)

the quantity c coincides with the central charge in d = 2 and has been recently proposed [29] to
be a possible generalization of a cl-function in d > 2. clearly, from (40), (41) and (42) we see
that the chiral transition above appears to be connected to new 3-dimensional cfts. the fact
that c in (40) is less than the corresponding free-eld theory value (8) and it is negative in (41),
seems to imply that the above critical theories may not be unitary. nevertheless, such theories
may conceivably correspond to three-dimensional versions of the non-unitary two-dimensional
lee-yang model [32].

the middle point of the chiral transition temperature window (39) is also interesting. at

12

this point hi takes its maximal value. from (15) we obtain for hi = /l,

hi =

2
l

ln  1 + 5
2 ! .

(43)

this value equals the value one obtains for the mass of the elementary bosonic modes in the
2+1 dimensional o(n ) vector model at nite temperature, when the theory is critical at t = 0
[30]. plugging this into (17) we can calculate the free-energy density which, by virtue of some
non-trivial polylogarithmic identities [30, 31] is found to be

fl

(44)

this is exactly minus the free-energy density of the 2+1 dimensional o(4n ) vector model at its
non-trivial critical point. in principle, a positive free-energy density which would correspond to
negative pressure and negative entropy seems to be a rather unphysical result [33]. however,
one might try to construct a physical system where the result (44) could make sense. this is the
o(4n ) n = 1 supersymmetric sigma model [34, 35] in the presence of an external a0 potential
at nite temperature. to leading-n , the free-energy density of this theory is simply given by the
sum of the free-energies of fermions and bosons. in general, supersymmetry is expected to be
broken at any nite temperature [36]. nevertheless, it may happen that for some temperature
the fermion contribution, given by (44), and the boson contribution cancel each other and the
system becomes supersymmetric again. note that the matching of the bosonic and fermionic
degrees of freedom is correct - the n = 1 supermultiplet in three-dimensions requires 2n two-
component majorana fermions. a similar bosonization of fermions has been recently discussed
in [37].

5 summary and discussion

in this work we studied the 2+1 dimensional gross-neveu model in the presence of an
imaginary chemical potential and argued that it provides an interesting ground for probing the
properties of chiral symmetry at non-zero temperature. in sec.3 we proposed a generalization of
the well-known formula for the canonical partition function and presented analytic expressions
for the free-energy density, the fermion number density and the chiral order parameter hi. we
demonstrated that this general formalism includes the standard grand-canonical formalism when
the chemical potential is real. in sec.4 we focused on the case of imaginary chemical potential.
we considered a u (1) gauge eld coupled to the gross-neveu model at nite temperature. such
a theory possesses innitely many equivalent z-vacua. we showed that when the gauge eld
uctuates around these z-vacua, as given by eq.(33), anyon-like excitations manifest themselves
in the spectrum of the 2+1 dimensional gross-neveu model. this is established by showing that
the free-energy necessary to immerse such an excitation is non-zero. furthermore, we provided
evidence that the expectation value of the abelian polyakov loop, which is the order parameter

13

for establishing whether the above u (1) gauge theory resides in one of the z-vacua, coincides
with the canonical partition function for imaginary values of the fermion number density. this
way we gave a physical interpretation to the canonical partition function with imaginary chemical
potential as being the free-energy needed to immerse an excitation of imaginary charge in the
spectrum of the 2+1 dimensional gross-neveu model. the latter excitation is related to the
anyon-like excitations discussed above. finally, we gave some results connected to the properties
of chiral symmetry in the presence of an imaginary chemical potential at nite temperature.

studies of the critical thermodynamic properties of a system undergoing a phase transition
are intimately connected to the lee-yang zeroes [38, 39]. these are the zeroes of the partition
function for imaginary values of the external magnetic eld, the latter being the conjugate
variable of the relevant order parameter. it is then conceivable that one could try to investigate
the critical properties of a system at nite density by studying its partition function (or its
free-energy density), at complex values of the number density, the latter being the conjugate
variable of the chemical potential. in this sense, the results presented in this work are closely
related to a lee-yang zeroes analysis.

these results can be extended in several directions. for example,it is possible in principle
to study numerically the partition function (11) for complex chemical potential and establish
the chiral symmetry restoration windows advocated above. it is also possible to numerically
compute the free-energy densities at the critical points and compare them with our analytic
results (40) and (41). furthermore, it would be interesting to compare the free energy density
(17) to the one recently proposed by laughlin [40] in order to reproduce the anomalous behaviour
of the thermal conductivity in some high-temperature superconductors of the bscco family [41]
13. since these compounds exhibit a new kind of phase transition induced by strong catalysts of
dynamical symmetry breaking, it is plausible that our generalized canonical partition function
formalism can be used to explain such unusual behavior. finally, based on the results of the
present work, it may be interesting to explore the possibility of nite temperature supersymmetry
restoration in n = 1 supersymmetric theories [43].
