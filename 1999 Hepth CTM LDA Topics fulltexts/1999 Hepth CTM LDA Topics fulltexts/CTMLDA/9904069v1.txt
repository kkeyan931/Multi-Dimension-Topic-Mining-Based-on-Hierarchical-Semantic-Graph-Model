abstract

we construct non-tachyonic, non-supersymmetric orientifolds of type 0b strings in ten, six

and four space-time dimensions. typically, these models have unitary gauge groups with

charged massless fermionic and bosonic matter elds. however, generically there remains

an uncancelled dilaton tadpole.

1. introduction

due to its possible application to the dynamics of non-supersymmetric gauge theories

in four dimensions, type 0b models have received much attention during the last months.

unfortunately, these models are plagued by the appearance of a tachyonic mode in the

closed string sector. however the eectice gauge theory on the d-branes of type 0b models

[1] is nevertheless tachyonfree and hence consistent. the couplings of the tachyon in the

eective low energy eld theory allow the dilaton to depend on the distance to the branes

in just the right way to be consistent with the one-loop running of the gauge coupling in

non-supersymmetric gauge theories.

in order to study consistent non-supersymmetric string vacua, one should of course

get rid of all tachyonic modes. tachyon-free, non-supersymmetric heterotic strings in four

dimensions with chiral, massless fermions were already constructed some time ago for

example in the covariant lattice formalism [2]. in the context of the type 0b string one

should include some projections modding out the tachyon. in [3,4] the standard orientifold

of type 0b was considered leading to a model containing still the tachyon in the closed

string sector as well as new tachyonic modes coming from open strings stretched between

d9 and d9 branes. the latter objects needed to be introduced into the background to

satisfy tadpole cancellation conditions.

in [4] the d-brane content of type 0b and its

orientifold type 0 was derived using the boundary state formalism. from the partition

function of type 0b it is clear that all ramond-ramond elds are doubled with respect to

type iib leading to a doubling of the d-branes as well.

in [3] it was observed on the level of conformal eld theory partition functions that

there exists another klein-bottle projection which leads to a non-tachyonic type i de-

scendant called type 0 in the following. this model has a non-zero dilaton tadpole which

however can be cancelled by the fischler-susskind [5] mechanism. compactications of

type 0 to six and four space-time dimensions were considered in [6]. however, the micro-

scopic description in particular the d-brane contents of these models is obscure in [3,6].

in this paper we revisit the non-tachyonic orientifold of type 0b, clarify the origin

of a second orientifold projection in terms of a dierent world-sheet parity , and de-

termine the d-brane contents of this model. moreover, we consider type 0b orientifolds
on t 10d/{g1, g2}, d = 6, 4, and derive the anomaly free massless spectra in specic
models. all of these models have in common some phenomenological appealing features

like a pure bosonic always unitary gauge sector with both bosonic and fermionic charged

matter. as in the parent type 0b model the gravity sector is purely bosonic.

1

moreover, we study the eective theory on the d3-branes in more detail nding some

pecularities reecting the fact that d9 and d3-branes repel each other.

2. review of type 0b model

in the construction of critical superstring theories one has to implement the gso

projection

pnsns =

1
4

(1 + (1)fl)(1 + (1)fr),

prr =

1
4

(1 + (1)fl)(1  (1)fr).

(2.1)

the two possible choices for the gso projection in the ramond sector lead to type iia and

type iib, respectively. however, it is known since 1986 [7] that using only the projection

p nsns =

1
2

(1 + (1)fl+fr),

p rr =

1
2

(1  (1)fl+fr)

(2.2)

still leads to modular invariant partition functions on the torus

zt =

1
2

|f3|16 + |f4|16 + |f2|16

|f1|16

,

(2.3)

called type 0b and type 0a depending on the sign in p rr. these ten dimensional string

theories are pure bosonic hence non-supersymmetric and contain a tachyon in the spectrum.

the non-supersymmetric model (2.3) can also be considered as the orbifold of type ii by
the space-time fermion operator (1)fs , where the tachyon makes its appearance in the

twisted sector. at the massless level the ns-ns sector contributes a graviton g , a

dilaton  and an antisymmetric 2-form b to the spectrum. for type 0b the rr sector
contributes two further scalars 1,2, two antisymmetric 2-forms b1,2
 and a 4-form d.
in type 0a models there are two 1-forms a1,2
 in the
rr sector. since compared to the type ii models all elds in the rr sector are doubled, one

 and two antisymmetric 3-forms c1,2

expects the d-brane content to be doubled, as well. the explicit form of the corresponding

boundary states was derived in [4], which we will briey review for later reference.

the boundary state of a dp-brane in type ii is a sum of four terms

|dpi =

1
2

(|dp,  = +1insns  |dp,  = 1insns + |dp,  = +1irr + |dp,  = 1irr)

(2.4)

2

and is invariant under the gso projections of type iia for even p and of type iib for odd

p. the individual terms are given by

|dp, insns =z (

9y=p+1

1
n

dk ) exp( xn=1"
exp(ixr>0"

px=2
px=2

9x=p+1
9x=p+1

(2.5)

and analogously for the rr sector, where one has to dene the rr vacuum in a consistent

way. however, in the type 0a and type 0b theories each of the four terms in (2.4) is

invariant by itself under the p projection, leading to four possible boundary states for

each p

|dp, , i = |dp, insns + |dp, irr

(2.6)

and their corresponding anti-branes for which the sign in front of the ramond-ramond
boundary state is reversed. the action of the world-sheet fermion number operator (1)fr

exchanges the |dp, , i brane with the |dp, , i brane. using the boundary states

(2.6) one rst computes the cylinder amplitude in tree channel

and then transforms to loop channel

(2.11)

vp+1 is the regularized dp-brane volume. from (2.9) and (2.10) one derives that for open
strings stretched between the same dp-branes the world-sheet fermions have half-integer

mode expansion whereas for open strings stretched between a |dp, , i and a |dp, , i

brane they have integer mode expansion. in the latter case fermionic zero modes appear

leading to space-time fermions.

in [4], and originally in [3], an orientifold of type 0b was studied, with the world-sheet

parity operation acting in the closed string sector as follows

n = n,
r = r,
 r = r,

|0insns = |0insns.

(2.12)

thus, the tachyon survived the projection and the klein-bottle only produced a ns-ns

tadpole which was partially cancelled by introducing the same number of |d9, +, +i and

anti- |d9, +, +i branes in the background.

it was not possible to cancel the tachyon

tadpole. from open strings stretched between the dierent 9-branes they got gauge bosons

of so(32)  so(32) and a further tachyon transforming in the bi-fundamental (32, 32)

representation of the gauge group.

moreover, in [4] it was shown that d1, d5 and d9-branes do survive the orientifold projec-

tion and that the world-volume theory on the d1-branes is in agreement with the world-

sheet theory of the bosonic string compactied on an so(32) lattice to ten dimensions.

the latter observation led to the conjecture that the two models might provide a string-

weak dual pair. we will now show in section 3 that there exists a dierent orientifold

projection leading to the tachyon-free model rst discussed in [3].

3. the type 0 orientifold

instead of (2.12) one can dene the action of  in the closed string sector as follows

n = n,
r = r,
 r = r,

|0insns = |0insns,

4

(3.1)

which apparently means  =  (1)fr. in the type iib theory this makes no dierence
for the action of  and  on physical states is identical. on the contrary, in the non-

supersymmetric type 0b theory the two actions dene two completely dierent models as

can be seen from the action of  on the ns vacuum, which projects out the tachyon.

3.1. the klein bottle amplitude

in doing an orientifold there generically appear tadpoles which ought to be cancelled

by contributions from an open string sector. therefore, we compute the klein bottle

amplitude for this model

where c = v10/(82)5. the transformation into tree-channel leads to

(3.3)

ek = 211 c z

dl

f 8
2 (e2l)
f 8
1 (e2l)

showing that there is only a contribution from rr 10-form exchange. the appropriate

branes one has to introduce to cancel this tadpole must be charged under the rr 10-form,

which are of course d9-branes. however, due to the action of the right handed world-
sheet fermion number operator (1)fr on d9-branes we are forced to introduce the same
number n of |dp, , i and |dp, , i branes. without loss of generality, we choose

9 = |d9, +, +i and 9 = |d9, , i branes in the following. the next step is to compute

the cylinder and mobius strip amplitudes for these branes.

3.2. the cylinder amplitude

the annulus amplitude is dened as

(3.4)

where the space time fermion number projection implies that only the open string ns

sector contributes. using the results (2.9) and (2.10) it is straightforward to determine the

individual contributions

(3.6)

up to a factor of two this is identical to the cylinder amplitude of two d9 branes of type iib.

therefore, even without supersymmetry the overall force between the same number of d9

and d9-branes vanishes, hence permitting a stable conguration of these branes. note,

that the tree channel amplitude (3.6) contains a dilaton tadpole as well as a rr 10-form

tadpole.

3.3. the mobius amplitude

finally, we have to compute the mobius strip amplitude

m = cz

dt

(3.7)

where again there is no contribution from the open string r sector. since  exchanges

d9 and d9-branes, the only non-zero contribution in (3.7) is from open strings stretched

between d9 and d9-branes. for the loop channel mobius amplitude one gets

m = cz

(3.8)

where  describes the action of  on the chan-paton factors. since the resulting tree

fm = cz

2 (ie2l)
dl 26 f 8
f 8
1 (ie2l)

tr(t

 1

 ),

(3.9)

there is only a contribution to the rr exchange tadpole.

3.4. tadpole cancellation

adding up all the three contributions, the tadpole cancellation condition for the rr

10-form potential reads

n 2  32 tr(t

 1

 ) + 322 = 0.

however, from ns-ns exchange we are left with an uncancelled dilaton tadpole

(3.10)

(3.11)

however, it was shown in [5] that a ns-ns tadpole does not render the theory inconsistent

for it means that we are not expanding around the true vacuum. one has to introduce a

non-constant dilaton and a tree level cosmological constant to cancel such a tadpole. in

section 4 we will mention that such a tadpole can possibly also be cancelled by introducing

lower dimensional d-branes in the background.

the rr tadpole cancellation condition (3.10) implies that the matrix  has to be sym-
metric. we are free to choose

 =(cid:18) 0

1

1

0(cid:19)2n,2n

,

(3.12)

where the rst n entries denote the d9-branes and the second n entries denote the

d9-branes. the o-diagonal choice in (3.12) reects the fact that  exchanges d9 and

d9-branes. plugging (3.12) into (3.10) one realises that the rr tadpole is cancelled for

precisely 32 d9 and 32 d9-branes.

3.5. massless spectrum

at the massless level in the ns-ns closed string sector  acts in the same way as

 leaving the graviton and the dilaton invariant, whereas the antisymmetric 2-form is

projected out. in the r-r sector before the projection one had

c8  c8 = 1 + 28 + 35+,

s8  s8 = 1 + 28 + 35.

(3.13)

since c8  c8 is invariant under (1)fr, these states have to be antisymmetrized under
 giving one 2-form eld. however, (1)fr gives an extra minus sign when acting on
s8  s8, so that these states are symmetrized leading to a scalar and an anti-selfdual 4-form
potential. thus, the closed string spectrum is the bosonic part of type iib, in particular

one expects the brane contents to be the same as in type iib.

in the open string sector, strings stretched between two d9 or two d9-branes, respectively,

carry the massless mode

which leads to the condition g =  t

g 1

 . the solution is

g =(cid:18) a

0

,

7

(3.14)

(3.15)

with a any hermitian matrix implying that the state (3.14) describes a vector boson of

the gauge group u (32). for open strings stretched between d9 and d9-branes there are

massless fermion states

|s1, s2, s3, s4i f

(3.16)

with sa =  1
chan-paton factors of the form

2 and p sa = odd from the gso projection. invariance under  requires

f =(cid:18) 0 b

c 0(cid:19)64,64

,

(3.17)

with both bt = b and ct = c. one can show that b and c behave dierently under
gauge transformations leading to a left-handed majorana-weyl fermion in the 496  496

representation of u (32). it was shown in [3] that the spectrum is anomaly-free. note, the
r6 term in the gravitational anomaly

496 iweyl  i4form

(3.18)

vanishes and exactly for n = 32 the trace in the antisymmetric representation of u (n)

factorizes

traf 6 = (n  32) tr(f 6) + 15 tr(f 2) tr(f 4)

(3.19)

so that a generalised green-schwarz mechanism can take over.

3.6. d-branes in type 0

as we have seen in the last subsection, the closed spectrum of type 0 contains the

same rr (p+1)-forms as type iib. thus, one expects that all dp-branes, for odd p, are

present, as well. this can also be shown using the boundary state approach. in [4] the

action of  on the boundary states |dp, insns,rr was determined

|dp, insns = |dp, insns,

|dp, irr = (i)7p|dp, irr

(3.20)

which in the case of the tachyonic type 0 orientifold implied that only d1,d5 and d9-

branes survived the projection. in our case  is equipped with the right moving world-
sheet fermion number operation (1)fr which has the following action on the boundary
states

(1)fr|dp, insns = |dp, insns ,

(3.21)

(1)fr|dp, irr = |dp, irr.

8

combining these two actions one can show that for every odd p the dp-brane

1

2(cid:16)|dp, +1insns  |dp, 1insns + |dp, +1irr + (1)

p1

2 |dp, 1irr(cid:17)

(3.22)

and the corresponding anti-brane are invariant under . in particular, type 0 contains a

self-dual d3-brane, which we will study a bit more in the next section.

4. massless modes on the d3-brane

since we have seen that type 0 contains d3-branes, due to its possible application to

non-supersymmetric gauge theories we investigate further the eective theory on a number

of parallel such branes.

from open strings stretched between 9-branes one gets simply the dimensional reduction

of the massless spectrum discussed in section 3.5 to four dimensions. from open strings

stretching between two 3-branes or two 3-branes there are massless modes of the form

(3.14). for  running over space-time values these states provide u (m ) gauge vectors.

for  running over transverse coordinates we obtain six scalars transforming in the ad-

joint representation. strings stretching between a 3 and a 3-brane have massless fermionic
modes of the form (3.16). the four states with s1 =  1
2 give left-handed fermions trans-
forming in the

representation.

plus the

strings stretching between 9 and 3-branes only carry massive modes, whereas strings be-

tween 9 and 3-branes respectively 9 and 3-branes, have massless modes of the form

|s1i m

(4.1)

with s1 =  1
2 transforming in the
(32, m)+(32, m) representation of the gauge group. however as a strange fact we observe

2 . the gso projection leaves only one state s1 = + 1

that the cpt conjugates of these states are absent. as listed in table 1, one could also

make the spectrum cpt invariant but then the states would formally transform in half
gauge multiplets1. it is interesting to note that the 1-loop -function for the u (m ) theory

is independent of m .

1 a similar eect happens for the eective theory on a d5 brane in type i [8], where naively
one gets half-hypermultiplets in the 95 open string sector. however, in that case the gauge group

was so(32)  sp(2n ) and the matter in the 95 sector transformed in the (32, 2n) representation

of the gauge group. this representation is pseudo-real and thus there is no inconsistency.

we think that the inconsistency in the fermionic spectrum simply reects the fact that due

to the cylinder amplitude for d9, 9- and d3, 3-branes (open strings stretching between

branes of dierent dimensionality)

(4.2)

there exists a repelling force between these two branes. thus a d9- and a d3-brane are

not allowed to form neither a static conguration nor a bound state.

note that a93 contributes to the ns-ns dilaton tadpole. this observation opens at least

in principle the possibility that the dilaton tadpole from the 9,9-branes is cancelled by the

d3-branes. in fact, combining the l   limit of a93 and (3.11) we nd that the ns-ns

tadpole is cancelled provided that

8n

v6

(82)3 = m,

(4.3)

where we have formally used v10 = v4v6. since the space transverse to the 3, 3-branes
is non-compact, we conclude that the dilaton tadpole only cancels in the limit m  

where the density of d3-branes m/v6 is constant.

for completeness we also present the mobius strip amplitude for the 3, 3-brane system

5. compactications of type 0 to six dimensions

non-tachyonic compactications of type 0 were considered in the abstract conformal

eld theory setting in [6]. in the present and the following section we consider orientifolds
t 10d/{g1, g2}, d = 6, 4, with g1, g2 internal abelian symmetries. we will provide
a microscopic description of these models in terms of open strings ending on d-branes.

the computational technique is very similar to the one presented in section 3, so that we

restrict ourselves to the main issues. we still want to get models without tachyons, which

highly restricts the number of possible internal symmetries.

in the supersymmetric case there are two possible kinds of orientifolds of a zzn orbifold,

which involve dierent actions of world-sheet parity on the twisted sector ground states. in

the mostly studied kind one actually divides out by  j  where j  exchanges the g twisted
sector with the g1 twisted sector. in six dimensions this leads to models with additional

tensor multiplets, cancelled tadpoles and anomaly-free perturbative massless spectra. in

generalising such orientifolds to our non-supersymmetric case one realizes that generically

there appear tachyons in twisted sectors, which are mapped under j  to tachyons in

dierent twisted sectors. thus, linear combinations of twisted sector tachyons survive the

projection. as was already observed in [6], the only  j  orientifolds in six dimensions

where this does not happen must have only twisted sectors of order two. this leaves the

two possibilities

zz2 : {(1 + r)  (1 + j )},

zz4b : {(1 + r)  (1 + j )},

(5.1)

where 2 = r and r is the reection zi  zi of both internal coordinates.

however as pointed out in [9], one can also divide out just by  without exchanging twisted

sectors. unfortunately, this introduces new tadpoles from the now non-zero twisted sector

klein-bottle contributions for which we do not know how to cancel them. consistently,

one does not get an anomaly free perturbative massless spectrum. in the supersymmetric

case type i -heterotic duality was the guiding principle in determining what extra non-

perturbative states from the type i side are massless, as well. in the type 0 case these pure

 orientifolds turn out to be important, for in these models apparently the twisted sector

tachyons are divided out. of course, one faces the problem of additional non-perturbative

massless states which luckily in six-dimensions might be detected by imposing anomaly

freedom. we will discuss one such example namely the zz3 orientifold in subsection 5.3.

11

5.1. the t 4/zz2 orientifold

computing the klein bottle amplitude for this model shows that one gets a tadpole

for both untwisted rr 10-form and rr 6-form exchange, whereas similar to type 0 in ten

dimensions there is no ns-ns tadpole. thus one is led to introduce d9 and d5-branes

and of course the corresponding d9 and d5-branes. the computation of the cylinder and

mobius amplitude is straightforward and very similar to the computation done in [10].

one nally ends up with three rr tadpoles to be cancelled. analogous to the gimon-

polchinski model [10] the twisted rr 6-form tadpoles are cancelled by choosing r traceless
for both 9 and 5-branes. the remaining two untwisted tadpole conditions are

(5.2)

similar to the type 0 model there arises an uncancelled dilaton tadpole in the annulus

amplitude. the tadpole cancellation (5.2) implies that the two matrices ,9 and r,5

the tadpole cancellation condition (5.2) implies that the number of 9 and 5-branes must

the closed string sector is presented in table 2, where we classied the states according to

their lorentz group so(4) = su (2)  su (2) representation.

table 3: open string spectrum of t 4/zz2

for the spectrum in table 2 and table 3 both the r4 and the f 4 anomaly cancels 1. there

are two ways to reduce this spectrum. one way is by moving some of the d5-branes away

from the xed point or turning on some wilson lines in the d9-brane gauge symmetry,

respectively. the other way is by turning on a discrete background ns-ns two-form ux.

using the methods developed in [11] we have computed some of the resulting spectra that

are presented in the appendix.

5.2. the t 4/zz4b orientifold

this is analogous to the type iib orientifold discussed in [12]. just as in that case,

the change     implies that the klein bottle amplitude by itself is divergence free.

hence, there are no branes and all matter comes from closed string sectors. the resulting

massless spectrum is shown in table 4.

1 note that our spectrum does not agree with the spectrum computed in [6] where instead of

the antisymmetric representation 120 there appeared the symmetric representation 136. we do

not see how we can reproduce the spectrum in [6].

this matter content is anomaly-free since there are no fermions and the number of self-dual

and anti-self dual tensors is the same.

5.3. the t 4/zz3 orientifold

in this section we will discuss the z3 orientifold where  does not exchange the two
twisted sectors. it is straightforward to compute the massless spectrum in the closed string

sector. the result is presented in table 5

thus at the massless level one gets the graviton, the dilaton, 22 self dual 2-forms, 2 anti-self

dual 2-forms and 82 further scalars. this spectrum is anomalous and must be extended by

massless states from the open string sector and as we will see from the non-perturbative

sector. to cancel the tadpole arising in the untwisted klein-bottle amplitude, one has

to introduce the same open string sector as in the  j  orientifolds. thus, there are 32

table 6: open string spectrum of t 4/zz3

it is encouraging that the f 4 gauge anomalies do all cancel. however, the r4 anomaly
is non-zero meaning that the open string spectrum can not be the complete spectrum.

unfortunately, since we do not know of any dual description we might use to determine

the missing states, we are restricted to make a guess guided by anomaly cancellation and

the analogy to the type i model discussed in [9]. the simplest guess for additional

fermionic matter is

9  {(28  28, 1; 1) + (1, 28  28; 1)}(1,2).

(5.7)

probably, there will also be further bosonic non-perturbative states but we do not know

how to detect them.

6. compactications of type 0 to four dimensions

we now consider orientifolds of type 0b on t 6/{g1, g2} with abelian g1, g2. to
be more specic, acting on internal complex coordinates zi, i = 1, 2, 3, a g1 or g2 element
g acts as gzi = e2ivizi. absence of tachyons in closed twisted sectors limit the allowed ~vs
that are also constrained by crystallographic action on the torus lattice. however, now the
condition v1  v2  v3 = 0 can be relaxed because our models are non-supersymmetric
from the start.
one allowed model is the zz3 orientifold with

zz3 : {(1 +  + 2)  (1 + j )},

(6.1)

where the generator  has ~v = ( 1
next section. there is also a t-dual version of the above, namely

3 ,  2

3 , 1

3 ). this example is studied in more detail in the

zz6b : {(1 +  + 2)  (1 + j 3)},

(6.2)

where 2 = . another possibility is a zz2 model with g1 = g2 generator having ~v =
( 1
2 , 1

2 , 1

2 ).

15

6.1. the t 6/zz3 orientifold

computing the klein bottle amplitude we nd that there are only tadpoles from the

untwisted rr 10-form and from twisted rr 4-forms. there are only 9 and 9-branes and

tadpole cancellation again requires n9 = n9 = 32. twisted tadpoles cancel provided that

this is satised by

tr ,9 = tr ,9 = 4 .

,9 = diag (i12, 2i12, i8),

,9 = diag (2i12, i12, i8),

(6.3)

(6.4)

where  = e2i/3. as we will see, necessarily ,9 =  
mation of open string states it is convenient to dene the full  embedding

,9. in order to study the transfor-

for the  embedding we take

 =(cid:18) ,9

0

0

,9(cid:19)64,64

.

j  =(cid:18) 0 1

1 0(cid:19)64,64

.

(6.5)

(6.6)

this is consistent with tadpole cancellation and group multiplication law.

let us now describe the massless spectrum. open strings stretching between two d9-branes

or two d9-branes give gauge vector states of the form (3.14), with  a four-dimensional

index. the gauge chan-paton factor must be of the form (3.15) as required by invariance

under j . invariance under  also requires

g = g 1



,

(6.7)

which implies a = ,9a 1
,9. given ,9 in (6.4) we then nd
that the gauge group is u (12)  u (12)  u (8). from 99 and 99 open strings there are

,9 and necessarily ,9 =  

also scalar states

i

2

|0ins s,

(6.8)

where i = 1, 2, 3 refers to the internal complex coordinates. invariance under j  gives

s =(cid:18) d

0 dt(cid:19)64,64

0

16

.

(6.9)

since the world-sheet piece picks up a phase  under , s must satisfy

s = s 1



.

(6.10)

thus, d =  ,9d 1
with multiplicities and representations given by

,9. this determines the representations. we thus nd scalar states

3  {(12, 12, 1) + (1, 12, 8) + (12, 1, 8)}.

(6.11)

scalar states with 

i
 1
2

|0ins s transform in the complex conjugate of the above.

open strings stretched between d9 and d9-branes carry massless fermions of the form
(3.16) with chan-paton factor f as given in (3.17), where bt = b and ct = c. the
world-sheet piece acquires a phase e2i(s1+s22s3)/3 under  so that f must satisfy

f = e2i(s1+s22s3)/3 f  1



.

(6.12)

this further constrains the matrices b, c and gives specic group representations for the
states. we thus nd that states with s1 =  1
2 are massless left-handed fermions in the
following representations and multiplicities

{(12, 12, 1) + (1, 1, 28) + (12, 12, 1) + (1, 1, 28)}+

3{(66, 1, 1) + (1, 12, 8) + (1, 66, 1) + (12, 1, 8)}.

(6.13)

states with s1 = + 1
summarised in table 5

table 7: open string spectrum of t 6/zz3

this spectrum is chiral and free of non-abelian gauge anomalies and agrees with the results

in [6]. concerning the u (1) factors, there is one non-anomalous and two anomalous com-

binations whose anomaly could presumably be cancelled by a generalised green-schwarz

mechanism.

17

the closed string massless spectrum is computed in the standard manner.

in the

untwisted sector the ns-ns states are the graviton plus 10 scalars, including the dilaton

and internal metric moduli, whereas the r-r states are 20 scalars and one vector that

arises from the 4-form. in the twisted sector the potentially tachyonic states are instead

massive but there are 27 ns-ns massless scalars and 54 r-r massless scalars.

it is also possible to include discrete or continuous wilson lines to obtain new models.

as explained in [13], the wilson lines must satisfy tadpole cancellation conditions and

they imply further projections on allowed states. in the zz3 orientifold at hand we can for
example introduce a discrete wilson line that gives a model with gauge group u (4)8.

7. conclusions

in this paper we have investigated a constrained set of orientifolds of type 0b in

which all tachyons are projected out.

in detail we have discussed the ten-dimensional

case, determined the d-brane contents of this model and computed the massless spectrum.

all tachyon-free orientifolds have in common that they have unitary gauge groups only,

admit massless fermionic matter and that there remains an uncancelled dilaton tadpole.

we have studied the eective gauge theory on parallel d3-branes with the negative result

that there appears an inconsistent spectrum reecting that d9 and d3-branes repel each

other. we briey discussed the possibility that the dilaton tadpole could be cancelled by

the d3-branes.

moreover, we have considered various tachyon-free compactications to six and four space-

time dimensions and derived the massless anomaly-free spectra.
