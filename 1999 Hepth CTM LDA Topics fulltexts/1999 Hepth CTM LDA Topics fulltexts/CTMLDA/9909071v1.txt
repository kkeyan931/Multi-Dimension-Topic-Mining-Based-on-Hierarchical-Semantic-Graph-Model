abstract

we discuss absorption of scalars by a distribution of spinning d3-branes. the
d3-branes are multi-center solutions of supergravity theory. we solve the wave
equation in various cases of supergravity backgrounds in which the equation
becomes separable. we show that the absorption coecients exhibit a univer-
sal behavior as functions of the angular momentum quantum number and the
hawking temperature. this behavior is similar to the form of the gray-body
factors one encounters in scattering by black-holes. our discussion includes the
problematic case of spherically symmetric distributions of d-branes, where reso-
nances arise. we obtain the same universal form for the absorption coecients,
if the region enclosed by the d-branes is excluded from physical considerations.
non-extremal d-branes are also discussed. the results are similar to the ex-
tremal cases, albeit at half the hawking temperature. we speculate that new
degrees of freedom enter as one moves away from extremality.

i. introduction

there exists ample evidence of an exact correspondence [13] between n = 4 four-
dimensional supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory in the large-n limit and string theory in
a supergravity background representing a collection of d3-branes whose near-horizon geometry
is the product of an anti-desitter space and a ve-dimensional sphere (ads5  s5) [13]. this
correspondence enables us to calculate correlation functions as well as various thermodynamic
properties of super yang-mills theories in the large-n limit using results from supergravity [47].
exact results are obtained primarily due to the superconformal invariance of super yang-mills
theory.

the metric for a stack of coincident d3-branes is

ds2 =

where

and the dilaton eld is constant. near the horizon (|y|  0), one may drop the constant term
in the harmonic function h and the resulting metric describes the space ads5  s5. the ads5
throat size, r, is also the curvature of s5. we obtain exact superconformal invariance on the
boundary of the ads space.

this is a special solution of the supergravity eld equations. it has zero temperature and is
maximally supersymmetric. if our goal is to understand quantum gravity, we need to study a
larger set of backgrounds that possess less symmetry and contain the special case (1) with h
given by (2) as a limit point. such studies have already appeared in the literature, starting with
linearized perturbations around the special solution [8] and including solutions of the full non-
linear eld equations [9,10]. of particular importance are solutions that represent a collection
of branes (multi-center). in this case, the harmonic function becomes

h = 1 + r4 z d6y (y)
|y  y|4 ,

z d6y(y) = 1

(3)

where (y) describes the distribution of branes, which can be discreet or continuous. these
d-branes correspond to a broken phase of the super yang-mills theory where certain operators
develop non-vanishing vacuum expectation values. this is the coulomb branch of the gauge
theory, because the remaining massless bosons mediate long-range coulomb interactions. su-
perconformal symmetry is broken. the space of these solutions is the moduli space of the
yang-mills theory. in this language, the special solution (1) with h given by (2) corresponds
to the origin of moduli space.

from the supergravity point of view, even eq. (1) with h given by (3) is but a special class
of solutions (extreme solutions). a larger class of non-extreme solutions has been found [1012].
it might be of interest to study this larger class of solutions, even though one expects that they

1

correspond to unstable states in the hilbert space of the gauge theory. they are all nite
temperature congurations and they might shed some light on the thermodynamic properties
of gauge theories, such as phase transitions [13].

a useful tool in these investigations is the study of interactions of branes with external
probes [1417]. in particular, the absorption cross-section for a scalar in an ads background
has been shown to agree with the one obtained from superconformal eld theory. this agreement
has been shown to be exact in the low energy (for the scalar) limit and for all partial waves
of the scalar eld [14]. extensions to higher energies have also been considered [16]. in the
more general case of non-coincident d-branes, such calculations are considerably more involved,
because the wave equation becomes non-separable. certain distributions of d-branes have been
discussed for the scattering of s-waves.

it should also be mentioned that the case of a spherically symmetric distribution of d-branes
has presented a puzzle [19]. in this case, the incident scalar eld exhibits resonant behavior
at certain values of its energy. these special frequencies extend all the way to innity and
are multiples of /r2, where  is the size of the distribution of the d-branes. thus, they all
go to zero as we approach the ads limit (  0), but it is not clear how that limit is to be
described. these resonances arise if one allows for reection of the incident wave o of the
d-branes without accounting for absorption.

here, we extend the study of absorption of scalars by a distribution of d3-branes to include
a larger set of supergravity backgrounds than previously considered and arbitrary partial waves.
we solve the wave equation in the respective backgrounds for various d-brane distributions in
the extremal limit. we also extend the analysis to the case of a non-extremal d3-brane. in
general, the waves become singular at the positions of the d-branes. we nd that the absorption
coecients exhibit a universal behavior similar to the form of the gray-body factors in the case
of black-hole scattering [18].

our calculations include the troublesome spherically symmetric d3-brane distribution where
it is easy
resonances arise for an innite number of frequencies of the incident wave [19].
to understand the origin of these resonances.
if the d-branes cover a closed surface in the
transverse space (with coordinates y1, . . . , y6), then the possibility arises of multiple reections
of the incident wave o of the d-branes. we demonstrate this for a spherical shell of d-branes as
well as a long needle (cylindrical symmetry). the waves are no longer singular on the d-brane
surfaces. then it is natural to ask what type of discontinuity the d-branes should impose on the
incident wavefunction. this question will probably be settled by a conformal eld theoretical
calculation. here we show that if reection is forbidden, the absorption coecients exhibit the
same behavior as in the healthier cases, where no resonances arise (i.e., when the d-branes
are distributed over an open surface in the transverse space). there is no reection if the region
enclosed by the d-brane distribution is excluded from physical considerations. thus, it appears
that the schwarzschild-like coordinates one works with in supergravity are more physically
relevant than the yi (i = 1, . . . , 6) coordinates of the transverse space in eq. (1).

our discussion is organized as follows. in section ii, we introduce the metric for a collection
of spinning d3-branes in the extremal limit and solve the wave equation in the respective
backgrounds. in section iii, we extend the analysis to the case of a non-extremal d3-brane.
the results are similar to the extremal cases, albeit at half the hawking temperature. our

conclusions are summarized in section iv.

ii. extremal d3-branes

in this section, we solve the wave equation for a scalar eld in a supergravity background
representing a distribution of d3-branes in the extremal limit. for completeness, we start
with the metric for non-extremal spinning d3-branes and then take the extremal limit. in this
limit, the branes are no longer spinning, but they settle to a state which is distinct from the
ads limit. these new vacua are stable due to the existence of a chemical potential. they
are distinguished by quantum numbers that correspond to the angular momentum in the non-
extremal regime [10].

the metric for a general distribution of spinning d3-branes in ten dimensions is [1012]

in the six-dimensional transverse space.

in the extremal limit, the horizon shrinks to zero (r0  0) and also   , so that the
charge r4 remains nite. the angular momenta also vanish and we obtain a static conguration.
these congurations are still described by the three angular momentum quantum numbers.
they are at nite temperature. the metric in the extreme limit becomes

and the other functions, f, , ,   are still given by eq. (7). it can be shown that this metric is

the wave equation in a general background is complicated. we will therefore restrict attention
to the special case 2 = 3 (cylindrical symmetry). we do not expect our conclusions to
change in the more general case, although it would take considerably more eort to prove it.

notice that the various functions, h, , , comprising the metric tensor, are functions of r, 
only. the ten-dimensional wave equation for a scalar eld,

aggabb = 0

(14)

becomes separable for elds that are independent of the angular variables , i (i = 1, 2, 3).
indeed, for a eld of momentum k and mass m2 = kk,

(x ; r , ) = eikx (r , )

(15)

after some algebra, we obtain

we will solve this equation in the limit where the mass is small compared with the ads curva-
ture, and the angular momenta are also small,

mr  1 ,

i

< mr2

(i = 1, 2)

(17)

in this limit, the terms proportional to the angular momentum components, i (i = 1, 2), can be
dropped. indeed, their contribution is m22
i  m2r2  1. therefore, they are small compared
to the angular momentum ( l2 term) contribution. the wave equation becomes

the eigenvalues of l2 are j(j + 4). therefore, the radial part of the wave equation is

(19)

we will solve this equation in two regimes, r  mr2 and r  1/m, and then match the
respective expressions asymptotically.

for r  mr2, we obtain

whose solution is

(21)

where we dropped the solution which is not regular at small r. the normalization is arbitrary,
since we only care about ratios of uxes. at small r, the solution behaves as

 

m2

2 (cid:19)j
4(j + 2)! (cid:18)mr

in the regime of small r (mr  1), the wave equation becomes

(22)

(23)

to solve this equation, we distinguish between three cases, in which one, two or three compo-
nents of the angular momentum are non-vanishing, respectively.

a. one-component angular momentum

the simplest case is the one where 2 = 3 = 0. the d-branes are a limiting conguration
of non-extremal branes spinning around an axis in the plane dened by the coordinates y1, y2
in the transverse space (cf. eq. (11)). they are uniformly distributed on a disk of radius 1 in
this plane [9,10]. to see this, note that the harmonic function h (eq. (13) can be written as

h = 1 +

r4
r4 = 1 +

r4
1 cos2 )r2

(r2 + 2

(24)

the d-branes are in the region bounded by the r = 0 surface, which is a disk of radius 1 in
the plane y3 = . . . = y6 = 0 (because of eq. (11)). dene

we see that we get contributions from both left- and right-moving modes at temperatures

and so the density of d-branes is proportional to r2  0. it follows that there can be no d-
branes in the interior of the four-sphere, therefore, the d-branes are distributed on the surface
of the four-sphere of radius 2 dened by r = 0. this distribution is uniform by symmetry, and
the density is  = 1

in agreement with the one-component case (eq. (39)) and with the same small-temperature

c. three-component angular momentum

next, we consider the case where all three angular momentum quantum numbers are non-
vanishing. this case is problematic, because of the emergence of an innite number of reso-
nances. these problems arise because the r  0 surface encloses a region of nite volume in
the transverse space spanned by the yi (i = 1, . . . , 6) coordinates [10]. in the cases previously

10

considered, when at most two angular momentum quantum numbers were non-vanishing, the
r  0 surface enclosed a region of zero measure in the transverse space. when this region
has nite volume, the possibility arises of the wave bouncing o of the branes (which are dis-
tributed on the r = 0 surface) an innite number of times, hence the resonant behavior [19].
we shall discuss two cases: (a) the spherically symmetric case (1 = 2 = 3), and (b) the
long needle case (2 = 3  1). we will compute the absorption coecients in both cases
and show that they are in agreement with our previous results. it should be emphasized that
this agreement is obtained when one performs the calculations in the schwarzschild-like coor-
dinates (4). the yi (i = 1, . . . , 6) coordinates span a larger space which includes a region of
nite volume surrounded by d-branes. it appears that this region, which is disconnected from
the region spanned by the schwarzschild-like coordinates (4), should be excluded from physical
considerations.

first, let us consider the spherically symmetric case, 1 = 2 = 3. the wave equation (23)

becomes

|(1 + 2i)|2
in agreement with previous results (eqs. (39) and (61)).

(72)

complications arise when one continues into the y < 1 region. to do that, we need to
assume a certain, spherically symmetric, distribution of d-branes. assuming the space y < 1
is empty, we obtain the wave equation

1

y3 (y5) +  r4m2

y2  j(j + 4)!  = 0

where we discarded the solution which is singular as y  0.
so eq. (65) should be replaced by

(73)

(74)

also, we may now have an outgoing wave in the y > 1 region, as well as an incoming wave,

4j+2(j + 1)!(j + 2)!

12

(75)

(76)

demanding continuity at y = 1, we can obtain all coecients, a, b, a. the system exhibits a
resonant behavior when either the wavefunction or its derivative vanishes on the d-brane (at
j+2(r2m/1) = 0, both of which
y = 1). in this case, we have either jj+2(r2m/1) = 0 or j 
have an innite number of solutions, mn = xn1/r2, or mn = x
n1/r2, where jj+2(xn) =
j 
j+2(x

n) = 0.

in hopes of shedding some light on this singular behavior, one may study the case where

two of the components of the angular momentum are small, i.e., let us assume

2 = 3  1

< r2m

(77)

this is a small departure from the one-component case considered above and one may hope
to recover that solution in the limit 2  0. contrary to expectations, we nd that the
resonances persist in the 2  0 limit. thus, even switching on small components leads to
a signicant departure from the one-component case. it appears that the region spanned by
the schwarzschild-like coordinates is more physically relevant than the entire transverse space
spanned by the coordinates yi (i = 1, . . . , 6).

we will solve the wave equation by considering two regimes, r  2 and r  1 < r2m.

when r  2, we can write

1

2

r2! r5!

r4m2
r2   j(j + 4) = 0

(78)

which is identical to the one-component angular momentum case. therefore, the solution is

 = a u1/2+i(1  u)j/2+2f (j/2 + 1 + i , j/2 + 1 + i ; 1 + 2i ; u)

(79)

where u = 1/(1 + 2

(87)

in agreement with the one-component case (eq. (39)).

again, complications arise when one considers the region y < 1. to illustrate the eect, we
shall only consider the case of an s-wave, j = 0. in this case, eq. (82) is the wave equation in
cylindrical coordinates. for higher j, we need to express the wavefunctions in terms of cylin-
drical harmonics instead of spherical harmonics, and calculations become increasingly involved
for large j. for j = 0, we obtain for y > 1,

assuming that the region y < 1 is empty, the wave equation becomes

this exhibits resonant behavior when the wavefunction vanishes on the d-branes, at y = 1.
the resonances are at the points

mn =

2r2

(91)

notice that in the limit 2  0, these resonances persist and it is not clear how one may recover
the one-component solution discussed above. however, if one excludes the cylindrical region
y < 1 enclosed by the d-branes from physical considerations, then one obtains the same type
of absorption coecients as in the rest of the cases (with one or two non-vanishing angular
momentum quantum numbers) and no resonances arise.

14

iii. a non-extremal d3-brane

when we try to go away from extremality, the wave equation becomes very complicated,
because the metric develops o-diagonal elements. still, we would like to study the more general
background of non-extremal branes and study their limit as the horizon shrinks to zero. here
we discuss the simplest case of all angular momentum quantum numbers being zero. setting
1 = 2 = 3 = 0 in eq. (4), the metric becomes

1

ds2 =

h (cid:16)(1  r4
+ hr2hd2 + sin2 d2

in line with the results we obtained in the extremal cases (e.g., eq. (72)), but at half the
hawking temperature.

if we are allowed to speculate, we would like to note that this is reminiscent of the case
where there are two modes at temperatures t1 and t2, and the hawking temperature is given
by 2/th = 1/t1 + 1/t2 [18]. if t2  , then t1 = th /2. thus, when we go o extremality,
it seems that the number of degrees of freedom doubles with the extra degrees living in a very
hot bath. of course, all this needs to be taken with a grain of salt, since away from extremality
supersymmetry is broken and there is no guarantee that the supergravity analysis is in any way
dual to the superconformal eld theory on d-branes. still, it is intriguing that similar results
are obtained for both non-extremal and extremal supergravity backgrounds.

iv. conclusions

we discussed the absorption of scalar elds by a distribution of d3-branes in the extremal
limit. these distributions are obtained as limiting cases of spinning branes which are solutions
of the full non-linear supergravity eld equations [912].
in the extremal limit, the branes
are no longer spinning, but they settle into a state which is distinct from the ads limit and
is characterized by angular momentum quantum numbers i (i = 1, 2, 3). the ads limit is
obtained when these quantum numbers approach zero. this set of supergravity solutions is
dual to the coulomb branch of the n = 4 four-dimensional su(n) super yang mills theory,
which is a superconformal eld theory. we solved the wave equation for scalar elds in the
respective supergravity backgrounds and computed the absorption coecient in each case.
we found that the absorption coecients exhibited a universal behavior as functions of the
angular momentum quantum number of the partial wave and the hawking temperature. this
functional dependence is of the same form as the grey-body factors associated with black-hole
scattering [18].

we also discussed the problematic case of a spherically symmetric distribution of d-
branes [19]. this is an example of the more general case where the d-branes are distributed on
a surface that divides the transverse space, dened by coordinates yi (i = 1, . . . , 6) (eq. (1))
into two distinct regions. this occurs when all three quantum numbers i (i = 1, 2, 3) are
non-vanishing [10]. the wave can then bounce o of the d-branes an innite number of times
and when this happens, one obtains a resonance. we obtained these resonances for both a
spherically symmetric and a long-needle distribution of branes. they present a puzzle as one
approaches the ads limit. however, if one uses the schwarzschild-like coordinates (4) instead,
which only cover the region outside the d-brane shell, thereby excluding the inner region from
physical considerations, we showed that one obtains the same form for the absorption coe-
cients as in the rest of the cases. it seems that the schwarzschild-like coordinates (4) are more
appropriate physically than the yi (i = 1, . . . , 6) coordinates.

finally, we went o extremality and solved the wave equation in the background of a brane
with a nite event horizon. here, too, we obtained the same form for the absorption coecients,
albeit at half the hawking temperature. we speculated that o extremality, new degrees of
freedom enter which must live in a hot bath. of course, since supersymmetry is broken, there

17

is no guarantee that a duality exists between supergravity and superconformal eld theory on
d3-branes. yet, it is intriguing that similar results are obtained in both the extremal and the
non-extremal cases, albeit with a twist.

it would be interesting to extend this analysis to more general supergravity backgrounds.
this is important for a better understanding of the maximally supersymmetric ads limit and
its thermodynamic properties. it will shed more light on the interesting issue of the ads/cft
correspondence.
