abstract

a non-abelian topological quantum eld theory describing the scatter-
ing of self-dual eld congurations over topologically non-trivial riemann
surfaces, arising from the reduction of 4-dim self-dual yang-mills elds, is
introduced. it is shown that the phase space of the theory can be exactly
quantized in terms of the space of holomorphic structures over stable vec-
tor bundles of degree zero over riemann surfaces. the dirac monopoles are
particular static solutions of the eld equations. its relation to topological
gravity is discussed.

1 introduction

we introduce a non-abelian topological eld theory (tft), which extends
the bf class of tft [1]-[2]. the theory we propose is constructed over a three
dimensional space-time with boundaries being riemann surfaces, which will
be interpreted as incoming and outgoing branes. although we discuss only
the case of a 3-dim base manifold, the topological action we present may be
extended to other dimensions as occurs with the bf theories. one motivation
of our proposal is to describe a tft whose path integral, with boundary
conditions determined by functionals in and out on the space of self-dual
yang-mills elds dimensionally reduced to 2-dimensions, at the incoming and
outgoing branes min and mout , may be interpreted as a scattering amplitude
[3]-[4] of self-dual elds. alternatively the path integral may be used to
dene a map from functionals of the elds  at min to the elds at mout by
considering

out(out) = z|m out=out

d exp(sef f ) in(in) ,

(1.1)

where the integral is performed over all elds whose restriction to mout is
equal to out .
in our proposal the elds in and out will correspond to
solutions of the hitchin self-dual equations over riemann surfaces [5] aris-
ing from the dimensional reduction of 4-dim self-dual yang-mills connections.
since the irreducible solutions of these equations are in one to one correspon-
dence to the holomorphic structures over stable vector bundles on riemann
surfaces, the path integral (1.1) provides a map between functionals of the
holomorphic structures at the boundaries min and mout .

since one sector of the irreducible solutions of hitchin equations provides
a model of teichmuller space as a (3g  3) dimensional complex space, our
proposal should be related to topological gravity in 3-dim [6].
in fact, it
is known that (2 + 1) dimensional gravity can be exactly quantized on a
space-time with topology r   where  is a genus g riemann surface. its
phase space has the structure of a cotangent bundle. more precisely it is the
cotangent bundle

t (a/g)

where a is the space of at so(2, 1) connections over , and g is the
gauge group of topological gravity in 3-dim. the space a/g is isomorphic
to teichmuller space, hence the physical hilbert space of states is the space

2

of square integrable functions over teichmuller space (or the moduli space
of riemann surfaces when dieomorphisms not isotopic to the identity are
included). we will show that the physical phase space of the tqft we
propose can be exactly quantized, we will then be able to determine the
relation between the hilbert space of physical states in (2 + 1) gravity and
our proposal, constructed from the reduction of 4-dim self-dual yang-mills
elds. previously to the presentation of the tqft we discuss a geometric
interpretation of bf tft and its natural generalization in terms of hitchin
self-dual equations. we will show later on that these equations arise as rst
class constraints on the tft we present.

2 geometrical interpretation of bf theories

if v is a c  vector bundle over a riemann surface , a holomorphic struc-
ture on v is a dierential operator

such that

b : 0(, v )  0,1(, v )
d

d
b(f s) = df  s + f d

bs ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

for any c  function f and section s  0(, v ). we denote by p(, v )
the p-forms on  with values in v . this denition is equivalent to the
more usual one given in terms of local trivializations which are related by
holomorphic transitions functions [5].

two holomorphic structures are said to be equivalent if there is a gauge

transformation such that

locally, we can write

g1d

bg = d

b2.

d
b = d + bdz

(2.3)

(2.4)

where df = f

z dz and b = b(z, z).

when the vector bundle v has hermitian structure we can associate to

d
b a unitary connection a. locally it may be expressed as

a = bdz  bdz.

(2.5)

3

from this point of view, the space of holomorphic structures on v may be
analysed in terms of the space of unitary connections. this is the starting
point in the analysis of hitchin in [5].

a rst result relating both spaces over a trivial line bundle   c is
that every holomorphic structure on   c is equivalent to the holomorphic
structure of a at unitary connection. this connection is unique modulo
unitary gauge transformations.

this result was generalized by narashmhan and seshradi to vector bun-
dles of higher rank: every holomorphic structure on a vector bundle over 
of degree zero which is stable, is equivalent to the holomorphic structure of a
at irreducible unitary connection. the connection is unique modulo unitary
gauge transformations.

this theorem stablishes then the relation between the space of stable
holomorphic structures over v and unitary bf topological theories.
in
fact the latest describe the geometry of at connections over (v, ). the one
to one correspondence is then obtained provided the bf theory describes at
irreducible unitary connections.

there is a generalization of the notion of geometrical stability for rank
2 holomorphic vector bundles of degree zero. it was introduced by hitchin
in [5], and refers to the stability of pairs (v, ) where  is a holomorphic
section of endv  k (k is the canonical bundle). the generalization of the
theorem of narashmhan and seshradi was formulated in [5] and stablishes
that the holomorphic structure of a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle v of
degree zero over a riemann surface  of genus g > 1, such that (v, ) is
stable in the sense of hitchin, is equivalent to an irreducible solution of the
self-duality equations:

fa + [, ] = 0,
d
a = 0.

(2.6)
(2.7)

the solution is unique modulo unitary gauge transformations. these

equations were called self-dual because they arise also from the 4-dimensional
self dual condition

fa = fa,

(2.8)

by dimensional reduction.

they are of course globally dened over  and are conformal invariant.

4

the topological eld theory describing the hitchin eld equations over
riemann surfaces was obtained in [7]. it gives then a generalization of the
bf theory over riemann surfaces.

one of the interesting properties of the self-dual equations over rie-
mann surfaces is that one sector of the full moduli space of solutions provide
a model of teichmuller space as a full (3g  3) dimensional complex space.
the topological action we will introduce in the next section formulated
over a 3-dimensional space time will allow to map functionals over the space
of solutions of the hitchin equations at an initial time, describing an holo-
morphic structure over the riemann surface of a given topology to solutions
at a nal time describing some other holomorphic structure, in terms of an
su(2) connection a and a su(2) valued 1-form .

3 the gauge invariant action

the topological su(2) invariant action we propose is

s = 2zm

d3x  trhb(f + [, ]) + d[]i ,

(3.1)

where m a 3 dimensional manifold   k where  is a riemann surface of
genus g and , ,  = 0, 1, 2.
the eld f is the lie algebra valued 2-form curvature corresponding to the
1-form gauge connection a; b, and  are independents lie algebra valued
1-forms. the covariant derivative is dened as dw = w + [a, w].

after expanding the elds in terms of the su(2) generators ta (a =

1, 2, 3), the action may be rewritten as

s = zm

d3x  hb

a(f

a + abc

b

c) + 

ad[]

ai .

(3.2)

taking variations with respect to the gauge eld aa
equation

 we obtain the eld

 (b

a  abc(b

ba

c + 

b

c)) = 0 ,

variations with respect to the eld a

 yields

 (

a + abc(a

b

c + b

b

c)) = 0 ,

5

(3.3)

(3.4)

variations with respect to the eld ba

 gives

f

a + abc

b

c = 0,

nally, variations with respect to the eld a

 leads to

d[]

a = 0.

(3.5)

(3.6)

it can be shown after some calculations that (3.5) and (3.6) are the inte-
grability conditions for equations (3.3) and (3.4). consequently in order to
solve the eld equations, we may rst look for solutions of (3.5) and (3.6)
which then ensures the existence of solutions for b and  .

the action (3.2) has several gauge symmetries which we will discuss

shortly. they are given by

a

a = d1
a = d2
a = d3
a = d4

(3.7)

the action (3.2) formulated in a canonical form, may be expressed as

from (3.8) we recognize a constrained theory with vanishing canonical hamil-
tonian, where the canonical conjugate momenta associated to aa
is given by
i

ia = 20ijba
j ,

while the one associated to a
i

is

p ia = 20ija

4a = oij(fij

bp ic = 0,
bic = 0,

bi

c) = 0.

(3.11)
(3.12)
(3.13)
(3.14)

we may write the algebra of the constraints using a compact notation in

the following way

{ia

(x), jb

(x)} = (c ij

k )abckc

(x)2

(xx).

(3.15)

where c ij

k are given by

(c 1j
(c 2j
(c mn
k
(c ij

k )abc = j
k )abc = mjj+mj

kabc,

k

)abc = 0,

k )abc = (c ji

k )abc.

abc

con mj  (1)j,

(3.16)

with i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, 4 and m, n = 3, 4.
the eq.(3.15) shows that all constraints are rst class and independent. we
are then dealing with a closed irreducible constrained system.

once the rst class constraints are imposed initially then the eld equa-
tions ensures that they are satised at all times. moreover from the point of
view of the quantum eld theory, when quantizing on a canonical gauge, the
conguration space is restricted to the submanifold dened by the rst class
constraints. the interesting property of constraints (3.11-3.14) is that (3.13)
and (3.14) the only ones restricting  and a are related to the hitchin [5]
equations over riemann surfaces obtained by reduction from self dual 4-dim
yang mills connections. this equations have a very rich structure related
to the teichmuller space of riemann surfaces as discussed before and are
exactly the eld equations obtained by bershadsky and vafa from 2 branes
on k3.

it is posible to relate (3.13-3.14) to (2.6-2.7) in a precise way.
the constraint (3.14) exactly agrees with (2.6) when we identify

z  1 + 2
az  a1 + a2
z = 1  2

7

(3.17)
(3.18)
(3.19)

where x1 and x2 are local cartesian coordinates. it follows that (3.13) may
be rewritten as

dzz  dzz = 0 .

(3.20)

it then follows that any solution of hitchin equations is a solution of (3.13-
3.14). conversely, given a solution of (3.13-3.14) one may x the gauge
a in (3.7), on a open set over the riemann surface
freedom with parameter 2
, by imposing the gauge xing condition

dzz = 0 .

(3.21)

in terms of the local cartesian coordinates, this gauge xing condition may
be rewritten

d11 + d22 = 0 ,

(3.22)

and can always be imposed on an open set over . consequently, over an
open set of  both set of equations are equivalent. the converse argument,
however, has not been stablished over the compact riemann surface . we
will denote h the space of solutions of (3.13),(3.14). having analysed (3.13)
and (3.14) we may now discuss the complete content of the rst class con-
straints (3.11)-(3.14). let (, a) be a point in h. we may consider a tangent
vector to h at (, a), we will describe it in terms of a variation (, a).
from (3.13) and (3.14) we obtain

oij[(diaj)a + abcj
oij[(dij)a + abcai

bi
bj

c] = 0
c] = 0

(3.23)
(3.24)

if we now identify the dual to the tangent vectors with the canonical momenta
to a and :

i  ajoij
p i  oijj ,

(3.25)
(3.26)

we then obtain precisely the constraints (3.11) and (3.12). a solution (, a, p, )
of the constraints (3.11)-(3.14) is then a point in the cotangent bundle t h.
to obtain the physical phase space we must still factor out the gauge group.
to do so, we notice from (3.7) that the gauge transformations for  and p
are the same as the gauge transformations for the variations a and 
respectively, provided the variation of 1 is identied to 4 and the variation

8

of 2 to 3 . we conclude then that by identifying gauge equivalent elements
of h, we automatically identify cotangent vectors. the physical phase space
is thus t (h/g) where g denotes the gauge group (3.7). the hilbert space
of quantum physical states is then the space of square integrable functions on
the space h/g , which can be identied (up to the point already mentioned)
with the space of self-dual solutions of hitchin equations, classifying the
holomorphic structures of a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle v of degree
zero, with stable pairs (v, ). we have thus shown that the physical phase
space of the tqft we proposed can be exactly quantized. for completness
we present now the brst invariant eective action of the theory.

to construct the brst charge we follow [9] and introduce the minimal
sector of the extended phase space expanded by the original canonical con-
jugate pairs (aa
i , ia) the canonical ghost and
anti-ghost associated to the rst class constraints.

the brst transformation for the canonical variables is given by

(3.32)

the hilbert space of physical states is then dened as the cohomology classes
of brst charge (3.27) acting on the space of functionals on the phase space.
they must correspond then to the space of functionals on t (h/g). it is
interesting that such mathematical result arises directly from the equivalence
of both quantization procedures. in the rst one we solved completely the
constraints and then quantize on the resulting physical space, in the latest
one we imposed the constraints on the functionals of the original phase space,
giving rise to the cohomology classes of the brst charge.

4 monopole solutions over s2 to the eld

equations

an interesting property of the eld equations (3.3-3.6) is that the connection
a describing the diracs monopole over the sphere s2 , that is the hopf

10

bration, is a static solution of them with the time component of a and 
being zero.

we only need to look for solutions of the eld equations (3.5) and (3.6)

over s2 , that we will rewrite below without the internal indices

f + [, ] = 0 ,
d[] = 0 .

(4.1)
(4.2)

we consider an ansatz for the solution, which may be written in terms of

dierential forms as:

and

a1 = a2 = 0 ,
a3 = n(1  cos)d ,

1 = f ()cosd  g()send ,
2 = f ()send + g()cosd ,
3 = 0 .

(4.3)

(4.4)

where the functions f () and g() have to be determined from the eld
equations. after solving all the eld equations, we obtain for them:

g() = (1 + n  ncos)f () ,

f ()g() = nsen ,

(4.5)

where the prime denotes derivative respect to  . finally we obtain the
following solution for the square of g()

g2() = [

1
2

n2cos2  2n(n + 1)cos] + c,

(4.6)

where c is an integration constant, which must ensure the positiveness of
g2 .

the curvature 2-form f satises

zs 2

f 3 = 4n,

11

(4.7)

where f 3 refers to the su(2) 3-index component of f . the solution so
obtained for f characterizes the connection 1-form of the diracs magnetic
monopole. this solution shows a denite distinction between the topological
theory we are considering and the bf tft, caracterized by at connections
only.

5 conclusions

we introduced an extension of the bf topological eld action. the theory
describes the evolution of the space of solutions of hitchin self-dual equations
over topologically non-trivial riemann surfaces. the functional integral of
the generalized bf action denes then a canonical map between the holo-
morphic structures of rank 2 vector bundles of degree zero over a riemann
surface of genus g > 1. the theory allows then a realization for the particular
problem considered, of the general approach proposed by atiyah [3].

the physical phase space of the theory was exactly quantized in terms
of the cotangent bundle t (h/g). the hilbert space of quantum physi-
cal states may consequently be identied to the space of square integrable
functionals on the space h/g described in section 3. the nilpotent brst
charge was also constructed and it was concluded that the above mentioned
hilbert space must be equivalent to the space of cohomology classes of the
brst operator. since one sector of the space h/g provides a model of te-
ichmuller space which is isomorphic to the space a/g1 , where a are the at
so(2, 1) connections and g1 the gauge group arising in topological gravity,
we then conclude that the hilbert space of physical states describing topo-
logical gravity [6] is a subspace of the corresponding one describing self-dual
eld congurations arising from the dimensional reduction of 4-dim self dual
yang-mills.

finally we found, over s2 , a static class of solutions to the eld equations
of the tft. they describe dirac monopoles over s2 showing an explicit
distinction with respect to the at connections arising from the bf tft.

the tft we have presented may be generalized in a straightforward way
to higher dimensions, in particular to 5 dim. however it is not clear that such
generalization will describe a tft with physical phase space related to 4-dim
self-dual yang-mills elds (as the case we have presented) or even better to
the 4-dim u(1) monopole equations introduced by witten [9] following the

12

seiberg-witten [10] duality approach. this problem is under study.
