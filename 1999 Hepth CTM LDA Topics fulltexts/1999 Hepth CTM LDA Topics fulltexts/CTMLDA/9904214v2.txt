abstract

to obtain some exact results of u(1) gauge theory (qed), we construct
the low energy eective action of n=2 supersymmetric qed with a massless
matter and fayet-iliopoulos term, assuming no connement. the harmonic
superspace formalism for n=2 extended supersymmetry makes the construc-
tion easy. we analyze the vacuum structure and nd no vacuum. it suggests
the connement in non-supersymmetric qed at low energies.

i. introduction

qed is the most successful quantum eld theory in the phenomenological point of view.
in fact, qed perfectly describes the electromagnetic interaction at low energies. however,
there is a question whether qed is a fully consistent theory beyond the perturbation theory.
qed has the landau ghost problem [1] and the renormalized coupling constant vanishes.
this means qed may be trivial as a quantum eld theory, and it can only be regarded as
a low energy eective theory.

on the other hand, miransky suggested that qed is non-trivial [2]. he investigated
a truncated schwinger-dyson equation for the fermion propagator and found a continuous
chiral phase transition. he claimed that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in the
strong coupling phase. after his work, non-perturbative studies of qed have been done
extensively [35]. some of numerical simulations were carried out to understand whether
qed is trivial or not. kogut et al. claimed that the existence of a chiral phase transition
was conrmed by numerical studies [6]. on the other hand, desy-julich group claimed
that qed is a trivial theory which is described by a gaussian xed point, and the critical
behavior around it is similar to the one of the 4 model [7]. this controversy is not resolved
yet.

recently, there has been much progress in the understanding of the non-perturbative
dynamics of n=1 and n=2 supersymmetric four-dimension eld theories. the exact su-
perpotential can be derived in n=1 supersymmetric qcd (sqcd: supersymmetric su(nc)
gauge theory with vector-like matters) [8], and the models with various gauge symmetries
and matter contents have been investigated. seiberg and witten derived the exact low en-
ergy eective action for n=2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory in coulomb phase
up to two derivatives [9], and generalized it to the case of n=2 sqcd [10]. their method
was applied to the dierent gauge groups and the solution was obtained.

since we can derive the exact low energy eective action (leea) of n=2 supersymmetric
gauge theories, we can expect to extract the exact information of non-supersymmetric gauge
theories, qed and qcd, for example. a simple way to break supersymmetry is to add soft
supersymmetry breaking terms.
in refs. [1116] soft breaking terms are used to explore
n=1 supersymmetric qcd and the phase structure of these theories in the absence of
supersymmetry. we will focus on n=2 supersymmetric qed (sqed) with a massless
matter to explore n=0 qed. it is well known that fayet-iliopoulos (fi) term spontaneously
breaks supersymmetry in n=2 sqed [1719]. we construct the exact leea of sqed with
fi term not introducing the soft breaking terms by hand.

in refs. [9,10] [1116] n=1 superelds were used to describe n=2 supersymmetric the-
ories. therefore, n=2 supersymmetry was not manifest in those works. we can use con-
strained superelds on the standard n=2 superspace [20], but these are not appropriate to
the construction and the analysis of the leea, because the description becomes extremely
complicated when the interaction is included on. an elegant o-shell formulation of n=2
supersymmetry is the harmonic superspace formalism, developed by galperin et al. [23].
in this formalism superleds are unconstrained and we do not need to solve complicated
constraints. n=2 supersymmetry is manifest at each step of the calculation. we will see
that this formalism is very powerful for constructing the leea in this paper.

the plan of this paper is as follows. in sec.ii we briey review the harmonic superspace

formalism stressing some important points for our main. in sec.iii we construct the leea
of sqed without the fi term as the rst step. in sec.iv we extend the discussion in the
previous section to the case with fi term. in sec.v we analyze the eective potential of the
leea which is obtained in the previous section, and discuss the vacuum structure of n=0
qed. sec.vi is devoted to the conclusion. our notations and conventions are summarized
in appendix.

ii. harmonic superspace formalism

we briey review some of the basics of the harmonic superspace formalism (hss). hss
is the formalism for n=2 extended supersymmetry developed by galperin et al. [23]. the
standard n=2 superspace is parameterized by the coordinates

{x, i, i

},

(1)

where  is the spinor index and i is su(2)r index. the key ingredient in hss is the harmonic
variables u
i which parameterize the coset space su(2)r/u(1). the variables satisfy the
relation

u+iu

i = 1,

(2)

where  denote u(1) charge 1. the variables of the harmonic superspace in the central
basis (cb) are

cb : {x, i, i

, u
i }.

(3)

harmonic superelds are the functions of these variables. in cb the dierentiation by the
harmonic variables are dened as

d++ = u+i 
ui

, d = ui 
u+i

,

and the integration over u is dened by the following rules:

z du 1 = 1,
j1    u
u

jm) = 0, n + m > 0,

z du u+

(i1    u+

in

(4)

(5)

(6)

where the parenthesis mean symmetrization of su(2)r indices. namely, the u integration
is dened to pick up the su(2)r singlet part. the lagrangian which is described by the
harmonic superelds is not manifestly real under the usual complex conjugation. however,
it is real under the conjugation which is the combination of the usual complex conjugation
and the star conjugation. the star conjugation for the harmonic variables are dened by

(u+

i ) = u

i , (u

i ) = u+
i ,

(7)

and other quantities are singlet under the conjugation. the harmonic variables are trans-
formed under the combined conjugation as

3



ui

= u

i , u
i



= ui.

there is another important basis called the analytic basis (ab):

 , 

 , u
i },

ab : {x
a, 
a = x  2i(i j)u+
x
i u
j ,
i ,  = iu
 = iu
i .

(8)

(9)

irreducible harmonic superelds are not the function of the entire variables of ab or cb but
the function on their subspaces, the analytic subspace (ass) or the chiral subspace (css).
ass is dened by

ass : a = {x

a, +

 , +

 , u
i },

(10)

and it is an invariant subspace under n=2 supersymmetry transformation. this fact allows
one to dene the analytic superelds which satisfy the analyticity conditions

d+(q)(a) = d+(q)(a) = 0,

where

d+ = diu+

i =



 , d+ = diu+

i =

(11)

(12)


  ,

and q denotes u(1) charge of the eld.

there are two basic supermultiplets in the n=2 supersymmetry: the hypermultiplet and
the vectormultiplet. fayet-sohnius(fs) supereld [21] describes the complex hypermultiplet
whose on-shell physical components are (f i, , ), where f i is a complex scalar in su(2)r
doublet, and (, ) is a dirac spinor1. the supereld with u(1) charge +1 is written down
as

+(a) = f +(xa, u) + 2+(xa, u) + 2+ (xa, u)

+ ++m (xa, u) + + +n (xa, u)
+ + +v(xa, u) + 2+ ++
 (xa, u)
+ 2+ (xa, u) + ++ + +d(xa, u),

(13)

where f +, m , n  and d are complex scalar elds, , ,  and  are weyl fermion
elds and v is a complex vector eld. each component eld can be expanded in u
i . for
example,

f +(xa, u) =



xn=0

f (i1in+1j1jn)(xa)u+

(i1    u+

in+1u

j1    u
jn).

(14)

1there is another harmonic supereld, howe-stelle-townsend supereld, which describes real
hypermultiplet [22].

4

therefore, fs supereld includes innite number of auxiliary elds. the action for a free
complex fs hypermultiplet is given by

sfs = z d (4)

a du +



d+++,

(15)

where d++ is a covariant derivative in ab given by eq. (a17) and d (4)
measure dened by

a

is the analytic

d (4)

a = d4xad2+d2 +.

(16)

solving the equation of motion d+++ = 0, we can easily check that only the physical
components (f i, , ) remain and follow free equation of motions.

the on-shell physical components of a vectormultiplet are (a, a, i), where a is a
complex scalar, a is a vector eld and i is a majorana spinor in su(2)r doublet. a
vectormultiplet is described by the dimensionless analytic supereld v ++ of u(1) charge
+2. it transforms under gauge transformation as

v ++ = d++(xa, u)

(17)

in abelian case, where  is an analytic supereld with u(1) charge 0. here v ++ is chosen
to be real, namely,

v ++ = v ++



.

(18)

if we take the wess-zumino-like gauge,

v ++(a) = ++ 1

a(xa, u) + + + 1

where d = d(ij)u
css is dened by

(20)

(21)

(22)

the supereld which is a function on css is called the chiral supereld. note that the chiral
supereld w does not explicitly depend on i and u
i and can not the function on ass. also

5

note that the analytic supereld can not be described as a function on css. the action of
a vectormultiplet is given by

(24)

the integrand of the rst term (the analytic part) must have u(1) charge +4 and does not
explicitly depend on  and , i.e., it must be analytic. the chiral supereld does not
appear in the analytic part, because the chiral supereld does not satisfy the analyticity.
similarly, we nd that the analytic supereld does not appear in the integrand of the second
term (the chiral part). the chiral part does not explicitly depend on i and u
i . these facts
are important for constructing the leea.

iii. construction of the leea without fayet-iliopoulos term

in this section we construct the leea of sqed with single massless matter using the
harmonic superspace formalism. in the next section we apply the method used in this section
to the case of including fi term. the tree-level action leads the scalar potential

2a|2 f ifi +

e2
0
2

v = |

( f ifi)2,

(25)

where e0 is the bare coupling constant, a and f i are the complex scalar elds in the vector-
multiplet and fs hypermultiplet, respectively. the classical moduli space is parameterized
by the vacuum expectation value of the complex scalar eld a. in case of single matter,
f i has no vacuum expectation value and the gauge symmetry is not broken. namely, the
theory is always in coulomb phase. if we consider multiple matter, the moduli space has
higgs branch in which the gauge symmetry is broken.

our strategy of getting the leea is the same which was developed in ref. [8]. the leea
must be invariant under the enlarged symmetry transformation in which the parameters of
the theory transform. these parameters can be considered as the vacuum expectation values
of some external superelds. the holomorphy (or analyticity) also constrains the leea. by
using the information obtained in the weak coupling limit, we can determine the leea.

the transformation laws of the elds and parameters in the fundamental theory is sum-

marized in table i.

we assume that there is no conment at low energies. if the resultant leea has no

inconsistency, we can conclude that this assumption is justied.

the general form of the leea of the chiral part (lowest order in the derivative expansion)

is given by

where g(w, ) is a holomorphic function which satises the following conditions.

lc =

4

imz d4g(w, ),

(26)

6

1. u(1) charge 0.

2. mass dimension 2.

3. u(1)r charge 4.

4. gauge singlet.

we stress again that the fs supereld can not appear in the chiral part. the parameter
 can be understood as the vacuum expectation value of the lowest component of a chiral
supereld. the above conditions restrict eq. (26) to be the form

lc =

1
4

imz d4g(cid:18) 

w(cid:19) w 2.

(27)

we can estimate g at one-loop level in the weak coupling limit   . namely, we can
get

thus we obtain

w(cid:19) ,

(28)

(29)

where g includes the non-perturbative eect. we assume that g does not have singularities,
namely, all massless particles have been already included. then, the liouville theorem leads

therefore, the chiral part is determined as

g(cid:18) 

w(cid:19) = constant.

lc =

(30)

(31)

this is exactly the same result given by seiberg and witten [10]. note that the singularity
at hwi = 0 is not removed in spite of considering the elementary matter eld. the theory
is not dened at hwi = hai = 0 within our assumptions.

next, we determine the leea of the analytic part. the general form is given by

la = z d2+d2 +du f (+4)(+, +



, v ++,d++),

(32)

where d++ represents the covariant derivative d++ = d++ + 2iv ++. analytic function
f (+4) must satisfy the following conditions.

1. u(1) charge 4.

2. mass dimension 2.

3. u(1)r charge 0.

7

4. gauge singlet.

we stress again that the chiral supereld w can not appear in the analytic part. considering
the above conditions, we obtain

lfs = z d2+d2 +du +



d+++.

(33)

surprisingly, this is the same form of the tree-level one. the rst derivation of the leea of
the hypermultiplet of sqed and sqcd was done in ref. [24] using the harmonic superspace
formalism. in ref. [24] the self-interaction of the massive fs hypermultiplet is derived by
the perturbative calculation:

l = z d2+d2 +du (+



+)2,

(34)

where  includes an infrared cuto. the self-interaction term does not appear in our method
based on the symmetry and holomorphy even in the massive case. it is expected that the
infrared divergence disappears by summing up all the one-loop diagrams with external fs
superelds, and only the higher order terms in the derivative expansion are obtained.

the total leea of sqed is

(35)

we remark the modication of the moduli space by the quantum eect. the quantum eect
forbids a part of the moduli space hwi = hai >  where the eective coupling e is
negative.

iv. construction of the leea with fayet-iliopoulos term

we construct the leea of sqed with spontaneous supersymmetry breaking to get some

exact results of n=0 qed. in case of sqed, we can introduce fi term

lfi = z d2+d2 +du ++v ++ =

1
3

ijd(ij), ++  iju+

i u+
j

(36)

to break supersymmetry spontaneously, where ij includes three real parameters (a) of mass
dimension 2:

 = i(a)(a) =   i(1) + (2)

i(3) i(1) + (2) ! .

i(3)

(37)

the procedure of constructing the leea is the same as that in the previous section.
the transformation laws for the elds and parameters are summarized in table ii. the
parameters ij can be understood as the vacuum expectation value of the analytic supereld
++.

first we consider the leea of the chiral part. repeating the same arguments in the

previous section, we obtain the general form

8

lc =

1
4

imz d4g(w, ) =

1
4

imz d4g(cid:18) 

w(cid:19) w 2.

(38)

this is exactly the same form that is obtained in the case without fi term. the coecient
++ can not be included in g. after all, using the one-loop result for g, the leea of the
chiral part is given by eq. (31).

next we consider the leea of the analytic part. the general form is

la = z d2+d2 +du f   ++

++



! +

d+++.

(39)

we can estimate the function f (cid:18) ++

++

(cid:19) in the weak coupling limit ++  0 using the

perturbation theory. we nd that there is no one particle irreducible diagram which includes
++ and conclude

f   ++

++

! = constant.

lim
0

(40)

we can make the constant unity by rescaling the eld +. including the non-perturbative
eect, f is given by

f   ++

++

! = 1 + f   ++

++

! ,

(41)

where f describes non-perturbative eect. here, we assume again that all massless elds
have been already included and the analytic function has no singularity. the liouville
theorem leads

f   ++

++

! = 1.

(42)

therefore, after all, the leea of the analytic part is exactly the same with that is obtained
in the case without fi term.

the fi term in eq. (36) is the exact form. an analytic function h(cid:18) ++

++

(cid:19) seems to be

allowed as the coecient function of fi term. however the function must be a constant due
to the gauge invariance. note that v ++ is gauge invariant up to the total derivative.

we conclude that the leea of sqed with fi term is given by

v. potential analysis of n=0 qed

in this section, we write down and analyze the eective potential of the leea which is

obtained in the previous section. we take the polar decomposition

a = aei,

(44)

where a and  are real scalar elds. the contribution to the potential from the analytic
part including fi term is

(46)

(48)

(49)

(50)

this solution gives ve = 0 and n=2 supersymmetry seems to be unbroken. however, such
a solution is ruled out, since a >  is not allowed by the quantum deformation of the moduli
space. therefore we conclude that there is no stable vacuum in the leea of sqed with
fi term under the assumption of no connement2 .

here, we summarize how the moduli space has been deformed. in the classical theory
the moduli space is parameterized by a, and any value of a is possible (g.4(a)). by the
quantum eect the region a >  and a point a = 0 are forbidden (g.4(b)). by including
fi term remaining moduli space is lifted up and slopes down to a = 0 axis, and no stable
vacuum exists (g.4(c)).

we interpret this results as follows. recall that we assume that the connement does
not occur at low energies. thus, the result no stable vacuum in the leea of sqed with fi

2without fi term there is a stable vacuum, of course. we can dene a theory on a point in the
moduli space except for a=0 and a > . for small a, the leea reduces to the one obtained in
the perturbation theory.

term, suggests that the connement may occur at low energies. if we assume connement
at low energies, we may be able to remove the singularity at a = 0 and may obtain a stable
vacuum.

the shape of the scalar potential is given in g.1. the vacuum energy incorrectly takes
negative value for a > . for a < , the potential slopes down to a = 0 axis where the
theory can not be dened. the slice of the potential along f = 0 axis is shown in g.2. we
have almost the same form as in g.2 for any slice along f 6= 0.

vi. conclusion

to obtain some exact results of qed, we constructed the leea of sqed with single
massless matter including fi term. we assumed that the connement does not occur at
low energies and the leea is described by elementary elds. we found that the harmonic
superspace formalism is very useful for applying symmetry and holomorphy in the construc-
tion. we reproduced the leea of the chiral part which is coincide with the result given by
seiberg and witten. we constructed the leea of the analytic part including fi term. this
part was the tree-level exact. we wrote down the scalar potential of the leea and analyzed
it. we found that there is no stable vacuum, and could not dene the theory. we interpret
this result as an evidence of the connement at low energies in non-supersymmetric qed.
if we assume there is connement at low energies, we may get rid of the singularity at a = 0
and obtain a stable vacuum.
