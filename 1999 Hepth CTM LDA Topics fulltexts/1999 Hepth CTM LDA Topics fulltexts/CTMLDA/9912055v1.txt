abstract

the identication of a causal-connection scale motivates us to propose

a new covariant bound on entropy within a generic space-like region. this

causal entropy bound, scaling as ev , and thus lying around the geometric

mean of bekensteins s/er and holographic s/a bounds, is checked in various

critical situations. in the case of limited gravity, bekensteins bound is the

strongest while naive holography is the weakest. in the case of strong gravity,

our bound and boussos holographic bound are stronger than bekensteins,

while naive holography is too tight, and hence typically wrong.

the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of a closed system tends to

grow towards its largest possible value. but what is this maximal value? bekenstein [1]

has suggested that, for a limited gravity system of energy e, whose size r is larger than its

gravitational radius, r > rg  2gn e, entropy is bounded by sbeb,

sbeb = er/h = rg r l2
p ,

(1)

1

where lp is the planck length (throughout this paper we will stress functional dependence,

while ignoring numerical factors, and set c = kb = 1). note that (1) bounds the ratio

entropy/energy for a system of given size. the entropy of normal systems, such as matter in

thermal equilibrium, is well below bound (1), moreover, in the 18 years which elapsed since

bekensteins proposal, and despite an ongoing debate [2], no physical example in which (1)

is violated has been produced. is the same bound applicable to more general situations, for

example, in cosmology? this question was addressed by bekenstein himself [3], who gave a

prescription for a cosmological extension by choosing r in eq. (1) to be the particle horizon.

is this a correct extension? and, even if so, is it possible to nd stronger bounds for systems

that are not of limited gravity?

holography [4] suggests that maximal entropy is bounded by shol,

shol = al2
p ,

(2)

where a is the area of the space-like surface enclosing a certain region of space. for systems

of limited gravity, since r > rg, a = r2, (1) implies the holography bound (2).

is it

possible to extend entropy/area holographic bounds to more general situations, for example,

to cosmology where, for large enough regions, it soon becomes tighter than entropy/energy

bounds? this issue was rst addressed by fischler and susskind (fs) [5], who proposed

that the area of the particle horizon should bound the entropy on the backward-looking

light cone according to (2). it was soon realized, however, that the fs proposal requires

modications, since violations of it were found to occur in physically reasonable situations.

several attempts were made to mend the fs proposal, rst within cosmology [69], and

then, by bousso, in arbitrary space-times [10]. in some cosmological situations, boussos

proposal reduces to the previously proposed ones, which identify the maximal size of a spatial

region for which holography works with the hubble radius [6], [7] (or apparent horizon [8]),

while in other situations it is quite dierent. the advantages of boussos proposal are

that (i) it is very general; and (ii) it is manifestly covariant. a possible shortcoming of

the proposal is that it bounds entropy on light-like hypersurfaces:

in order to extend the

2

bound to space-like regions, a space-like projection, which is not always possible, has to

be performed [10].

we make here a motivated proposal for an improved covariant bound, applicable to

entropy on space-like hypersurfaces, and test it in several critical cases. we then compare

our bound to other proposals, in particular to bekensteins and boussos, and show that,

for systems of limited gravity, bekensteins bound is the tightest, while, in other situations,

our bound is the strongest one proposed so far which does not lead to contradictions for

space-like regions. a crucial dierence between our proposal and boussos is that bousso

decides from the start to look for a holographic s/a bound and, as he points out, this forces

him to consider light-like hypersurfaces. we do not insist, a priori, on a holographic bound,

but aim at generality of the hypersurface and check how holography may or may not work

a posteriori.

let us rst state our proposal, and then motivate and test it. consider a generic spacelike

hypersurface, dened by the equation  = 0, and a compact region lying within it dened by

  0. we propose that the entropy contained in this region, s( = 0,   0), is bounded
by sceb, where, up to obvious powers of lp and h,

sceb = z<0
d4xg( )smax(cid:20)(t  t 
z<0

d4xg( )qmax [(g  r)   ] =
g t ) (cid:21)

(3)

here g, r are the einstein and ricci tensor, respectively, t is the energy-momentum

tensor, and t its trace. to derive the second equality we have used einsteins equations,

g = 8gn t. note the appearance of the square-root of the energy contained in the

region, which we alluded to in the abstract. note also that (3) is manifestly covariant, and

invariant under reparametrization of the hypersurface equation: such an invariance requires a

square-root of    . reality of sceb is assured if sources obey the weak energy condition,
t    0, since then the sum of the two combinations in (3), and thus their maximum,
are positive. in the limit in which the hypersurface is lightlike, eq.(3) becomes:

3

sceb =z<0
=z<0

d4xg( )qr 

d4xg( )qt   ,   = 0 ,

(4)

and appears to be related to one of the assumptions made in [11] (eq. (1.10)) in order

to derive a modied bousso-type bound. we should stress, however, that (4) does not

necessarily follow from the arguments given below in support of (3).

the physical motivations leading us to the above proposal are similar to those used in the

recently proposed hubble-entropy-bound (heb) [7] (see also [6,8,9]) i.e.: (i) that entropy

is maximized, in a given region of space, by the largest black hole that can t in it (ii)

that the largest black hole that can hold together without falling apart in a cosmological

background has typically the size of the hubble horizon. this second, crucial assumption

appears to be supported qualitatively by a number of previous results [12], but clearly needs

to be rened and, possibly, to be dened covariantly. with such a goal in mind, we will

proceed as follows: we will start by identifying a critical (jeans) length scale above which

perturbations are causally disconnected so that black holes of larger size, very likely, cannot

form. we will rst nd this causal connection (cc) scale rcc for the simplest cosmological

backgrounds, then extend it to more general cases and, nally, guess the completely general

expression using general covariance.

in order to identify the cc scale for a homogeneous, isotropic, and spatially at back-

ground, let us consider a generic perturbation around such a background in the hamil-

tonian approach developed in [13]. the fourier components of the (normalized) pertur-

bation and of its (normalized) conjugate momentum satisfy schroedinger-like equations

+hk2  (s1/2)s 1/2i bk=0, bk

+hk2  (s 1/2)s1/2i bk=0, where k is the comoving momen-

tum, a prime denotes dierentiation w.r.t. conformal time , and s1/2 is the so-called pump

bk

eld, a combination of the various backgrounds which depends on the specic perturba-

tion under study. the perturbation equations clearly identify a jeans-like cc comoving

momentum

k2

cc = maxh(s1/2)s 1/2 , (s 1/2)s1/2 i

4

= maxhk + k2 ,  k + k2i ,

(5)

where k = (s1/2)s 1/2. note that eq. (5) always denes a real kcc since the sum of the
is positive semidenite. since tensor perturbations
two quantities appearing on the r.h.s.

are always present, let us restrict our attention to them. the pump eld s1/2 is simply

given, in this case, by the scale factor a() so that k  h = a/a. eq. (5) is immediately
converted into the denition of a proper jeans cc length rcc = ak1
cc. substituting into

eq.(5), and expressing the result in terms of proper-time quantities, we obtain (for tensor

perturbations)

r2

cc = maxh h + 2h 2 ,  h i .

(6)

before trying to recast eq.(6) in a more covariant form let us remove the assumption of

spatial atness by introducing the usual spatial-curvature parameter  ( = 0,1). the
study of perturbations in non-at space [14] is considerably more complicated than in a

spatially-at background. the nal result, however, appears to be extremely simple [15],
and can be obtained from the at case by the following replacements in eq.(5): h2  h2 +,
h  h. using this simple rule (see below for another conrmation of its validity) we arrive
at the following generalization of (6)

r2

cc = maxh h + 2h 2 + /a2,  h + /a2i .

(7)

at this point we could have introduced anisotropy in our homogeneous background and

study perturbations with or without spatial curvature. this should certainly be done as a

check of a short-cut procedure based on general covariance that we adopt instead. we note

that the 00 components of the ricci and einstein tensors for our background are given by

r00 = 3( h + h 2) , g00 = 3(h 2 + /a2) .

obviously,

r2

cc =

3

max (g00  r00)

= 4gn max(cid:20) 

3  p ,  + p(cid:21) ,

(8)

(9)

where we have inserted einsteins equations using, as an example, a perfect-uid energy

momentum tensor, t 

 = diag(,p,p,p). eq.(9) is guaranteed to dene a real rcc if
the weak energy condition (reading here  > 0) holds, since the sum of the two combinations

is positive in this case [16].

as a nal step, let us convert eq.(9) into an explicitly covariant bound on entropy using,

as in [7], the idea that entropy is maximized by having maximal size black holes lling up

the volume. using rcc as the maximal scale for black holes, we get a bound on entropy
which scales like s  v r3
terms of the components of the ricci and einstein tensors in the direction orthogonal to

p . we now express r1

p = v r1

cc as in (9) in

cc r2

ccl2

cc l2

the hypersurface on which the entropy is being computed. this can be done covariantly by

dening the hypersurface through the equation  = 0 and by identifying the normal with
the vector  . this procedure leads immediately to the proposal (3).

alternatively, using standard 3 + 1 adm formalism [17], we can express the relevant

components of the ricci and einstein tensors in terms of the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature

of the hypersurface under study and arrive at the following nal formula:

sceb = l2
p

z d3xh [max (p , q)]1/2 ,

(10)

where p = 1

2r +  + 2

32 + 2 a , q = 1

2r   32 +a, and using standard notations, we
have denoted by r the intrinsic 3-curvature scalar, by  the expansion rate, by  the shear,
and by a the acceleration given (for vanishing shifts ni) in terms of the lapse function n
by a = n 1n ,i
;i.

we turn to check our proposal for various physical systems and to verify that it is sensible.

1. systems of limited gravity

we note (see below) that for systems of limited gravity the bekenstein bound is tighter than

ours sbeb < sceb. therefore, in all systems for which the beb is obeyed, ours will be

obeyed as well.

2. cosmology

the universe is a system of strong self-gravity. the geometry of the universe is determined

6

by self-gravity, and the size of the universe is at least its gravitational radius. the strongest

challenges to entropy bounds in general, and to our bound in particular, come from con-

sidering (re)collapsing universes. we discuss three cases basically exhausting the possible

types of cosmologies:

 (i) | h|  h 2.

in this region eective energy density and pressure are of the same

order,   p, and all previously suggested length scales that should be considered in
entropy bounds, such as particle horizon, apparent horizon, rcc, hubble length, are

parametrically equal. in particular, it is already established that heb is not violated

if some reasonable restrictions on the equation of state are imposed, and therefore our

bound (and others) is also valid.

 (ii) | h|  h 2. in this case | + p|  , and the universe is inationary. here the
naive holographic bound fails miserably, but heb does well. since in this case rcc is
parametrically equal to |h|1, it follows that ceb works as well as heb.

 (iii) | h|  h 2 i.e.

||  p. since  and p are the eective energy density and
pressure, there are no problems with causality. this case occurs, for instance, near the

turning point of an expanding universe which recollapses as the result of a negative

cosmological constant, of positive spatial curvature (or of both). both the naive heb

and the apparent horizon bound (ahb) of [8] fail here, while boussos prescription

does ne. we would like to show that ceb can easily cope with this third case.

consider either a at or closed universe with some perfect uid in thermal equilibrium

and a constant equation of state p =  , 1 >  > 1, and with an additional small negative
cosmological constant  = . the universe starts out expanding, reaches a maximal size,
and then contracts towards a singularity. in this case, matter entropy within a comoving

volume is constant in time, but near the point of maximal expansion the apparent horizon,

and the hubble length, diverge, causing violation of the heb and ahb. however, for a xed
comoving volume, sceb  a3r1

cc, and, since rcc is never larger than some maximal value,

7

ceb has a chance of doing better.

to see this explicitly, note that,

in this case, and independently of , r2

cc =
1/3max[1/20(1  3)a3(1+)  2 , 3/2(1 + )0a3(1+)]  1/2(1 + )0a3(1+), where
0 is the initial energy density and a is the ratio of the scale factor to its initial value.
it follows that, in a xed comoving volume, sceb  a3/2(1). since  < 1, this means
that sceb grows during the expansion, reaches a maximum at the turning point, and then

starts decreasing. if we give initial conditions at a time when curvature and cosmological

constant are negligible, which is always the case at suciently early times, ceb will be

obeyed initially provided energy density and curvature are less than planckian. but then

the above evolution of sceb will guarantee that the bound is fullled at all times until

planckian density and curvature is reached in the recollapsing phase, i.e. throughout the

classical evolution of our universe.

in spite of the above encouraging results, we would like to express caution about the

assumption of homogeneity and isotropy. since we are considering matter in thermal equi-

librium at temperature t , it has mass uctuations (cid:16) m

m (cid:17)  (t )3, in a region of size ,

which, once the universe starts contracting, begin to grow on time scales r1

cc, so assuming

homogeneity and isotropy could be incorrect.

3. collapsing regions

in this case we have limited computational power. we can qualitatively check cases that are

similar to the cosmological ones [18], such as homogeneous, isotropic contracting pressureless

regions, or a contracting homogeneous, isotropic region lled with a perfect uid. the

pressureless case can be described by a friedman interior and a schwarzschild exterior.

since ceb is valid for the analogue cosmological solution it is also valid for this case.

a particularly interesting case is that of the (generically non-homogeneous) collapse of

a sti uid (p = ), which, up to a simple eld redenition, can be mapped onto the

dilaton-driven ination of string cosmology [19].

in this case one nds a constant sceb

in agreement with the heb result [7]. hence, no problem arises in this case, even if one

starts from a saturated sceb at the onset of collapse. for non-sti equations of state, the

8

situation appears less safe if one starts near saturation (this was already pointed out in [10]

for boussos case). as bousso himself points out, however, care must be taken in this case

of perturbations which tend to grow non linear and form singularities on rather short time

scales. such cases cannot be described analytically, but have been looked at numerically.

we believe that numerical investigations of collapsing systems will be extremely useful in

determining the general validity of ceb and of other entropy bounds.

finally, we compare our ceb to previously proposed bounds, in particular to beken-

steins and boussos. for systems of limited gravity whose size exceeds their schwarzschild

radius: r > rg, bekensteins bound is given by s < sbeb = l2

p r rg, and boussos pro-

cedure results in the holography bound (2) [10], s < shol = l2

p r2, but since r > rg,

sbeb < shol, and therefore boussos bound is less stringent than bekensteins. consider

now ceb applied to the region of size r containing an isolated system. expressing ceb in

the form (3) one immediately obtains:

sceb = l1

p r3/2e1/2h1/2 = (shol sbeb)1/2 ,

(11)

implying

sbeb  sceb  shol.

we conclude that for isolated systems of limited self-gravity the bekenstein bound is the

tightest, followed by our ceb and, nally, by boussos holographic bound.

for regions of space that contain so much energy that the corresponding gravitational

radius rg exceeds r, bekensteins bound is the weakest, while the naive holography bound

is the strongest (but very often wrong). boussos proposal (see also [8]) uses the apparent

horizon rah while ceb uses rcc. for homogeneous cosmologies, rcc < rah, since r2
cc,

according to (7), is always larger than the average of the two terms appearing on its r.h.s.,

which is precisely r2

ah = h 2 + /a2. since, for a xed volume, the bounds scale like r1
ah

or r1

cc, we immediately nd that ceb is generally more generous than the ahb proposed

in [8]. this is what makes it possible for ceb to be fullled in the negative cosmological

case discussed above, where ahb or heb are violated. comparison with boussos proposal

9

is more subtle, since he makes use of the ah area to bound entropy on light sheets. this

can be converted into a bound on the entropy of the space-like region inside the ah only

in special cases. that is what makes boussos bound fullled even when the straight ahb

fails.

to summarize, we have found that, for systems of strong gravity,

sahb  sheb  sceb, sbousso  sbeb ,

i.e., that our ceb and boussos holographic bound are the strongest (yet apparently safe)

bounds, while bekensteins is the weakest. instead, the naive holography bound comes out

badly:

implied by bekensteins in the case of limited gravity, and too tight (and hence

typically wrong) in the case of strong gravity. boussos modication fares much better than

the naive holographic bound. we believe, however, that ceb, by being applicable to space-

like regions, stands out in terms of its physical motivations and its potential for practical

uses.

we anticipate applications of ceb to the study of the possibility that black hole remnants

carry enough entropy to restore unitary evolution. ceb may be converted into a new kind

of generalized second law following [20], and used to study cosmological singularities. the

investigation of these possibilities is left, however, to future work.
