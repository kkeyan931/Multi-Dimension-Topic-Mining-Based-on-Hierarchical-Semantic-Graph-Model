(2.1)-(2.3), rewritten , respectively, sjt  = 1 2gz d2x (u m2 sin u), u m2 sin u = 0, (cid:16) m2 cos u(cid:17) = 0, euclidean laplacian, 2 + 2 x. (2.5) (2.6) (2.7) wish choose solutions eq. (2.6) one-instanton ones, following instanton-dilaton pair: 3 u(s)(x, t) = 4 arctan exp (m), (s)(x, t) = c1 sech (m) + c2  , (2.8) (2.9) ci arbitrary constants, = (x vt), 1/ = 1 + v2. metric (2.4) transformation {x, t} {r, t}, 2gm "dt m3 sech (m) , cosech2 (m) v2 d# , v/ dt = vs vs 2gm r = 1 arbitrary constant, rewritten explicit form representing jt black hole solution ds2 = (cid:18)m2r2 2gm (cid:19) dt 2 +(cid:18)m2r2 2gm (cid:19)1 dr2, following energy event horizon ebh = m, rbh =s 2gm m3 . (2.10) (2.11) purpose take account eld uctuations neighborhood solution construct eective action jt black hole zero-brane. go further, one develop general approach. iii. effective action section construct nonlinear eective action arbitrary multiscalar 2d theory vicinity solitary-wave solution, apply jt dilaton gravity. fact, describe procedure correct transition eld particle degrees freedom. indeed, despite solitary-wave solution resembles particle classical quantum levels, yet remains eld solution innite number eld degrees freedom whereas true particle nite number degrees freedom. therefore, obliged correctly handle circumstance (and several others) otherwise deep contradictions may appear. a. general formalism let us consider action describing n scalar elds s =z l() d2x, nxa=1 1 2 (ma)(ma) u(). 4 l() = (3.1) (3.2) corresponding equations motion mma + ua() = 0, dened ua() = u() , uab() = 2 u() ab . suppose, solution class solitary waves (s) () = (s) ((x vt)) , = 1/1 v2, localized energy density () =xa l() (0a) 0a l(), nite mass integral = +z ((s) ) = l((s) ) < , +z coinciding total energy lorentz factor . let us change set collective coordinates {0 = s, 1 = } xm = xm(s) + em (1)(s), a(x, t) = ea(), xm(s) turn coordinates (1+1)-dimensional point particle, em (1)(s) unit spacelike vector orthogonal world line. hence, action (3.1) rewritten new coordinates (3.3) (3.4) (3.5) (3.6) (3.7) (3.8) (3.9) 1 s =z l(e) d2, 2 (ea)2# u(e), 2xa "(sea)2 l(e) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = x2(1 k), xm k = mn xm xn ( x2)3 , k curvature particle world line mn unit antisymmetric tensor. new action contains n redundant degrees freedom eventually lead appearance so-called zero modes. 5 eliminate must constrain model means condition vanishing functional derivative respect eld uctuations chosen static solution, result obtain required eective action. given expression so, uctuations elds ea() neighborhood static solution (s) () () + a(). (3.10) substituting eq.

(3.5), (3.6), (3.15), (3.19) (3.20), expression written simple form (for simplicity suppose eigenvalues, ca c, otherwise rst integral eq. (3.18)) cannot reduced integral (3.6) evaluated separately) = 2c + 1 2c2 +z u ((s) ()) d, (3.21) second term integrated full derivative. therefore, even non- zero1, always remove means including surface terms action (3.11) adding appropriate counterterm action (3.8): 1 2c2 +z s(reg) = s se = z ds x2(cid:18)1 + d2k2u (). 1 2c k2(cid:19) . (3.22) thus, obtain nal form eective zero-brane action theory straightforward derive corresponding equation motion frenet basis 1it identically vanishes | ()| o(1) innity. (s) 7 1 x2 ds 1 x2 dk ds +(cid:18)c 1 2 k2(cid:19) k = 0, (3.23) hence one see eq. (3.13) nothing equation linear approximation k 1, expected. thus, problem yet demands resolving determination eigenvalue c. turns sturm-liouville problem system (3.16) chosen boundary conditions. one supposes, instance, niteness g innity c spectrum turns discrete. moreover, often happens c one two admissible values2. may, exact value c necessary hence system (3.16) resolved exactly possible. let us consider closely. main problem functions ga mixed equations. separate them, let us recall exist n 1 orbit equations, whose varying resolves separation problem. consider case n = 2, i.e., biscalar theory, helpful applying jt gravity. considering (3.15), varying single orbit equation yields 2 1 = 2 (s) (s) 1 = g2 g1 , (3.24) hence system (3.16), n = 2, separated two independent equations + (s) g c! ga = 0, (s) (3.25) uab() b. form much easier resolve eigenvalue problem. one uses =xb therefore, two independent parameters action (3.22), c, determined immediately virtue eqs. (3.6) (3.25). finally, pointed developed method generalized qualitative direction (considering yang-mills spinor lagrangians ) toward increasing spatial dimensions. b. application jt black hole studies convenient perform wick rotation work terms solitons lorentzian time rather terms instantons euclidean time, 2for instance, works  (one-scalar 4 theory)  (3 liouville model), special cases formalism used, c form m2 single positive half-integer integer; cases c < 0 have, rule, independent physical sense, quantization either interpreted terms antiparticles appear unphysical all. 8 main results previous subsection independent v. omitting topological surface terms, consider instead action (2.5) lorentzian analogue sjt  = 1 2gz d2x(m mu m2 sin u). soliton-dilaton doublet (2.8), (2.9) localized energy density (3.5) (x, t) = 2m2 g c1 tanh (m) + c2  cosh2 (m) , interpreted relativistic point particle energy eclass = +z (x, t) dx = 2c2m g , i.e. integral (3.6) nite coincides energy (2.11) = m, (3.26) (3.27) (3.28) one redenes c2. action (3.26) always linearly rearranged form (3.1), (3.2), intro- duce elds 2u = 1 i2, / = 1 + i2, (3.29) arbitrary real constant (similarly c1) aect nal results. suppose nal zero-brane action (3.22). spacetime coordinates x (3.7) understood sense substituted initial curved spacetime one eective potential, meaning collective coordinates remains unchanged describes internal structure hence independent whether working curved space. therefore, main task specify parameters action (3.22) case. already determined (3.28), eigenvalue c remains unknown parameter eq. (3.22). eqs. (3.25) require traditional boundary conditions whereas provided eqs. (2.8), (2.9), (3.29) system (3.25) form ga(+) ga() = o(1), g + (ka c) ga = 0, m2 a1( cosh2 (m) 2) + c2 cosh5 (m) + a2(6 cosh2 (m)) k1 = cosh2 (m) k2 = k1|cici, a1 = cosh (m) (42 + 3c2), a2 = sinh (m) (c1 + c2m), cosh (m) (42 + c2 + c2 cosh2 (m)) a2 (3.30) (3.31) , 9 hence clear ka(0) = m2, ka() = ka(+) = m2. (3.32) eigenvalue equation evidently hard solve exactly, hence use method approximing potential would main properties ka especially presented (3.32). besides, consider equation k1 potentials approximately behaviour. thus, omitting index assume following eigenvalue equation g + m2 1 2 cosh2 (m)! g cg = 0, (3.33) instead eq. (3.31). potential main features ka appears exactly solvable: according proven theorem (see appendix a), admissible non-zero c c = m2. (3.34) result conrmed also quasiclassical approximation. condition convergence phase integral indeed, necessary appears following one pd = 2 +z qka c ka() c = 0, yields eq. (3.34) again. therefore, eective zero-brane action dilaton gravity jackiw-teitelboim black hole uctuational corrections se = z ds x2 1 + k2 2m2! , = = 2c2m g . (3.35) next section quantize obtain quantum corrections mass xed-gauge jt black hole. iv. quantization previous section obtained classical eective action model question. thus, quantize must consecutively construct hamiltonian structure dynamics point particle curvature . 10 a. general formalism brane action (3.22) denition world-line curvature one see theory higher derivatives . hence, treat coordinates momenta canonically independent coordinates phase space. besides, hessian matrix constructed derivatives respect accelerations, (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) mab = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2le xa xb(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , appears singular says presence constraints phase variables theory. mentioned, phase space consists two pairs canonical variables: xm, pm = qm = xm, = le qm m, le qm , hence pn = en n = c (0)(cid:20)1 en (1)q2 k, 1 2c(cid:21) + c en (1)q2 k, components frenet basis em (0) = xm x2 , em (1) = 1 x2 em (0) k . exist two primary constraints rst kind 1 = mqm 0, 2 = pmqm +qq2" + q22# 0, c 2 besides add proper time gauge condition, g =qq2 1 0, (4.1) (4.2) (4.3) (4.4) (4.5) (4.6) (4.7) remove non-physical gauge degree freedom. then, introducing new variables, =qq2, v = arctanh(cid:16)p(1)/p(0)(cid:17) , constraints rewritten form (4.8) 11 1 = , 2 = "qp2 cosh v + c 2(cid:16)2 (cid:17)# , v 22 g = 1, hence nally obtain constraint 2 = qp2 cosh v + quantum theory (v = i/v) yields b2|i = 0. c 2 2 v 0, (4.9) (4.10) shown ref.

(4.17) hence, obtain ground-state mass quantum particle curvature coin- cides classical one, m0 = , (4.18) expected. further, absence exact wave functions excited levels one nd rst (small) quantum correction mass approximation quantum harmonic oscillator. easy see b 1 (eective) potential 2(cid:19)2 v () =(cid:18)b sinh2 b 2 cosh 13 (4.19) single minimum vmin = b/2 min = 0. following h-expansion technique shift origin coordinates point minimum (to satisfy = 0 = 0 absence quantum oscillations), expand v taylor series second order near origin thus reducing model oscillator unit mass, energy /2 oscillation frequency therefore, quantization rules yield discrete spectrum = 1 2qb(b 1). =qb(b 1)(n + 1/2) + o(h2), n = 0, 1, 2, ..., (4.20) rst quantum correction particle masses determined lower energy oscillations: = 1 2qb(b 1) + o(h2), gives algebraic equation function . easily resolve approximation admissible major physical cases, obtain b 1 c/2 0, considering eqs.
