abstract:

we provide a non-renormalization theorem for the coecients of the conformal anomaly
associated with operators with vanishing anomalous dimensions. such operators include con-
served currents and chiral operators in superconformal eld theories. we illustrate the theorem
by computing the conformal anomaly of 2-point functions both by a computation in the confor-
mal eld theory and via the ads/cft correspondence. our results imply that 2- and 3-point
functions of chiral primary operators in n = 4 su (n ) sym will not renormalize provided
that a generalized adler-bardeen theorem holds. we further show that recent arguments
connecting the non-renormalizability of the above mentioned correlation functions to a bonus
u (1)y symmetry are incomplete due to possible u (1)y violating contact terms. the tree level
contribution to the contact terms may be set to zero by considering appropriately normalized
operators. non-renormalizability of the above mentioned correlation functions, however, will
follow only if these contact terms saturate by free elds.

1 introduction

supersymmetry has been an instrumental tool in probing the strong coupling regime of
string and quantum eld theories. in many cases, information which is regarded as dynamical
in non-supersymmetric theories follows by symmetry considerations in supersymmetric ones.
certain sectors of the theory are so severely constraint that no quantum corrections are allowed
at all. a famous example is the non-renormalization theorem of [1] which states that the
superpotential does not receive any perturbative corrections. another symmetry which, when
present, severely constrains the structure of eld theories is conformal symmetry. conformal
invariance has been quite successfully exploited in two dimensions where the conformal group
is innite dimensional. in more than two dimensions the conformal group is nite dimensional,
nevertheless it is powerful enough to determine 2- and 3-point functions up to constants [24].
the aim of the present paper is to discuss non-renormalization theorems that follow from the
combination of supersymmetry and conformal invariance. in particular, we will study the trace
anomaly in the presence of external sources for composite operators. we will show that the
trace of the energy-momentum tensor acquires contributions proportional to the sources and
that certain ratios of the coecients of these terms to the overall normalizations of 2- and 3-
point functions do not renormalize. recent studies of the constraints imposed by superconformal
invariance can be found in [512].

one of the motivations for this investigation comes from the recently proposed duality [1315]
between string or m-theory compactications on adsd+1 spacetimes and d-dimensional super-
conformal eld theories (ads/cft duality). in particular, iib string theory on ads5  s5 with
n units of f5 ux is believed to be dual to n = 4, d = 4 su (n ) sym theory. the t hooft
coupling constant,  = g2
y m n , is related to the ads curvature and n is related to the string
coupling constant, such that the strong coupling regime of the t hooft large n limit of n = 4,
su (n ) sym theory (i.e. n   with  xed but large), has a weakly coupled description in
terms of anti-de sitter supergravity. an essential test for any strong-weak coupling duality in-
volves quantities that do not renormalize as one goes from weak to strong coupling. computing
such quantities in both weak and strong coupling regimes and nding agreement only provides
a non-trivial consistency check; a possible disagreement between the two computations would
denitely demonstrate the falsication of the duality conjecture. one of the aims of this inves-
tigation is to provide such non-renormalization theorems, and subsequently test the ads/cft
duality.

turning things around, one can also use an unexpected agreement between quantities com-
puted in the two dual theories as an indication of a possible non-renormalization theorem. for
instance, using the ads/cft correspondence the gravitational trace anomaly was computed
in [16] and exact agreement was found with the weakly coupled (free) eld theory calculation,
indicating that there is a non-renormalization theorem at work. indeed, such a renormaliza-

2

tion theorem has been discussed in [1719]. in [14, 15] a prescription was given for calculating
boundary greens functions from anti-de sitter supergravity. with this prescription all two-
and three-point functions of chiral primary operators were calculated in the large n limit in
[20]. surprisingly, the result was found to coincide with the weak coupling (free eld theory)
computation. this led the authors of [20] to conjecture that the 3-point functions of all chi-
ral primary operators for large n are independent of  and to speculate that they might be
independent of gy m even for nite n . subsequent eld theory calculations [21, 22] supported
the conjecture in its strongest form. in [2325] the non-renormalization of the 2- and 3- point
function was claimed to follow from a bonus u (1)y symmetry that n = 4 sym should have
in an appropriate limit. however, as we will discuss, contact term contributions to correlation
functions render the argument of [23, 24] incomplete. only if the contact terms saturate by free
elds non-renormalization would follow. the results of the present paper imply that (properly
normalized) 2- and 3-point functions of chiral primary operators will be independent of g2
y m for
any n , if (i) the standard relation between trace anomalies and r-anomalies due to supersym-
metry holds in the presence of sources for composite operators and (ii) the divergence of the
r-current in the presence of external sources saturates by free elds.

this paper is organized as follows.

in the next section we recall the connection between
conformal anomalies and short distance singularities. section 3 contains the non-renormalization
theorem. in section 4, we use the theorem to test the ads/cft correspondence by computing the
conformal anomaly associated with 2-point functions. section 5 contains some further comments
about the application of our results to n = 4 sym and an analysis of the contact terms enter
in the discussion of the u (1)y bonus symmetry. we conclude in section 6.

2 conformal anomalies and short distance singularities

consider a cft in a d-dimensional curved background with metric g (x) and let its gen-
erating functional for connected renormalized n-point functions of a scalar composite operator
o(x) be denoted by wr  wr[g, j], where j(x) is an external source for o(x). the discus-
sion generalizes straightforwardly to the case of many, possibly non-scalar, composite operators.
correlation functions are obtained by functional dierentiation in a standard fashion,

ho(x)i =

1
g

wr
j(x)

,

ht (x)i =

2
g

wr

g (x)

.

(1)

requiring that wr does not change under constant weyl rescalings of g (x) and j(x) leads to
the following renormalization group equation (we are at the xed point where the beta functions
vanish) [26],




(cid:18)

j(x)(cid:21)(cid:19) wr = 0 ,
where  is an arbitrary mass-scale and  is the conformal dimension of o(x).

+z ddx(cid:20)2g (x)

+ (d  )j(x)





g (x)

(2)

note that (2) is general enough to include the possible existence of conformal anomalies in
the theory. these, as is well known, are intimately connected with uv renormalization. their
coecients are quantitatively related to the subtraction procedure of short-distance singularities
in n-point functions. let us briey recall this fact. the generating functional of connected graphs
may be written as

wr =



xk=1

1

k! z ddx1g .. ddxkg j(x1)..j(xk)ho(x1)..o(xk)ir .

(3)

the usual renormalization procedure requires that both j(x) and ho(x1)...ir are -dependent
[27]. under the weyl rescalings considered in (2), the scalar sources in (3) transform as
(/)j(x) = (d  )j(x). then, we can calculate the partial derivative of wr as






wr = (d  )z ddxg j(x)

wr
j(x)



+

xk=1

1

k! z ddx1g .. ddxkg j(x1)..j(xk) 


ho(x1)..o(xk)ir .

by virtue of (4), we then obtain from (2)



xk=1

1

k! z ddx1g .. ddxkgj(x1)..j(xk)



ho(x1)..o(xk)ir = z ddxgg (x)ht (x)i,

(4)

(5)

which shows that possibly existing local delta-function terms in the renormalized n-point func-
tions of o(x) are related to conformal anomalies. since the dimension of t (x) is d, (5) implies
that conformal n-point functions of scalar operators oi(x) with dimensions i, i = 1, 2, .., n
may in general contribute to the conformal anomaly if

n

xi=1

i = (n  1)d + 2k ,

k = 0, 1, 2, .. .

(6)

for example, the two-point function of a scalar operator with dimension  contributes to the
conformal anomaly when

 =

+ k ,

k = 0, 1, 2, .. .

(7)

it is well known that conformal invariance xes the form of scalar 2- and 3-point functions

up to an overall constant [2, 3],

constant(s) and scaling dimensions of the operators involved. it follows from (8) and (9) that
they are symmetric in their indices. the operators oi and oj in the 2-point function necessarily
have the same dimension i = j = , thus one may choose a basis such that c ij
2 (g, ) =
ij c2(g, ).

one might wonder how is it possible for the conformal eld theory correlation functions to
depend on a scale  when their form has been determined by conformal invariance. the answer
is that the distributions appearing in the right hand side of (8) and (9) are conformal away from
coincidence points but, depending on the scaling dimension of the operators involved, they may
acquire singularities when some of the points come close together. regularizing such singularities
entails introducing a mass-scale , which in turn allows for the possibility of conformal anomaly.
if the  derivative of the regularized 2- and 3-point (or, more generally, of n-point) function
yields a local term, then (as it follows from (5)) the trace of the energy momentum tensor
acquires a contribution of the form,

ht 

i =

1
2p ij

(2)(2)kij j i j j +

1
3!p ijk

(3) (2)kijk j i j j j k +  ,

(10)

where the integers kij and kijk can be read o from (6). one can check, using (6), that both
sides of this equation scale the same way, as it should.

3 the theorem

we are now ready to prove the following non-renormalization theorem:

theorem: the ratio of the conformal anomaly associated with 2- and 3-point functions
to the overall constant appearing in the 2- respectively 3-point functions does not renormalize,
provided the anomalous dimensions of the operators involved are zero.

proof: since the form of the 2- and 3-point functions of operators of given dimensions
is uniquely determined by conformal invariance, 2- and 3-point functions of operators with
vanishing anomalous dimensions will be given by (8) for any value of the coupling constant. the
overall constants c2 and c3 may receive quantum corrections. however, because the anomalous
dimensions of the operators involved and the beta function vanish, c2 and c3 are renormalization
group invariants, i.e.

(11)

(12)

therefore, from (5) and (10)



c2 = 

c3 = 0 .







p(i)
ci

= 




g(i)
ci

,

which proves our assertion, since the  dependence of g(i)/ci follows from the mathematical
properties of the distribution, the latter being xed at all scales from conformal invariance alone.

5

so far our considerations apply to any conformal eld theory. although we have only consid-
ered scalar operators, one can (appropriately) generalize the discussion to non-scalar operators
as well. a class of operators with zero anomalous dimensions are conserved currents. another
class of such operators are chiral operators in superconformal theories [28]. when supersymme-
try is present, one can often connect correlation functions of non-scalar operators to ones of only
scalar operators. this is, for instance, the case when d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetry is present
(as we review in section 5). in these cases, it is supersymmetry that extends the results of the
theorem to non-scalar operators.

in the case of superconformal theories, supersymmetry, apart from protecting the dimensions
of chiral operators, also connects the trace anomaly to the divergence of the r-current. whether
this connection holds in the presence of composite operators is an open question. assuming such
a connection, the non-renormalizability of 2- and 3-point functions would follow if the r-current
satises a sort of generalized adler-bardeen theorem. by this we mean that the divergence
of the r-current in the presence of composite operators will saturate by free elds. we are not
aware of any discussion, let alone a proof, of such theorem in the literature. let us further note
that even the validity of the standard adler-bardeen theorem is not automatically guaranteed
in the case of superconformal theories. the issue of the compatibility of such a theorem with
supersymmetry has been the source of much controversy in the 80s (see for instance [29, 30];
for a recent discussion we refer to [31]). we note, however, that the n > 1 cases are less subtle.
the standard proofs of the adler-bardeen theorem (see, for instance, [32]) consist of showing
that the coecient of the anomaly is a renormalization group invariant. however, when the beta
functions are zero, as in the case of stationary renormalization group ows, this fact by itself
does not imply that such a coecient is independent of the coupling constant. for the case of
n = 4 sym a dierent argument was given in [19] for the one loop nature of the chiral anomaly.
in our case, we would like to have such a theorem for the divergence of the axial current in the
presence of sources for composite operators.

4 ads/cft duality

in certain cases, a given conformal eld theory has a conjectured ads dual. in these cases,
one can use the non-renormalization theorem provided in the previous section in order to test the
ads/cft duality. as an illustration we compute the conformal anomaly associated with 2-point
function using both cft and ads methods. the (considerably more involved) computation of
the conformal anomaly associated with 3-point functions will be presented elsewhere [33].

4.1 cft computation

in this section we compute the conformal anomaly associated with 2-point functions using
dierential renormalization techniques [34]. 2-point functions involve distributions of the form

( 1

sd1(2)k(d)(x) ,

(13)

where sd1 = 2d/2/(d/2) is the volume of the unit (d  1)-sphere. from (13) we see that
(x2) has poles at  = 1
2 d + k, k = 0, 1, .... to get a well-dened distribution we need to
subtract the pole. we do this by rst considering arbitrary , subtracting the pole, and then
letting   d/2 + k.
it suces to work out the case  = d/2, since the other ones can be
obtained by dierentiation as

(15)

(16)

the coecient of the last term, which is proportional to (d)(x), is scheme dependent, but its
precise value does not enter in the computation of the conformal anomaly.

from (14) and (16) we nally obtain

(17)

(18)

therefore, by virtue of (5), we nally obtain the conformal anomaly (10) as,

(19)

notice that the ratio p(2)/c2 only depends on the conformal dimension  and the dimension
of spacetime d. since, by assumption, the operators have vanishing anomalous dimensions, the
ratio does not renormalize.

it is instructive to re-derive this result by using ward identities. we will see that one can
maintain the gravitational ward identity only at the expense of introducing an anomalous term
in the trace ward identity. the latter is precisely the conformal anomaly. this analysis also
nicely illustrates the need for specic contact term contributions to correlation functions.

7

symmetries in quantum eld theory manifest themselves in ward identities that greens
 , where  denotes

functions satisfy. let us consider a symmetry generated by the currents j 
the adjoint representation indices. we take the composite operators oi to transform as

oi = (t )ijoj ,

(20)

where (t )ij are group generators and  arbitrary parameters. let j i denote the source for
the composite operator. then one can, in a standard way [27], derive the ward identity,

hj 

 (x)is = (t )ij j j (x)hoi (x)is ,

(21)

where the subscript s indicates that the sources have not been set to zero. dierentiating (21) a
number of times with respect to the sources and setting the sources to zero, one derives relations
among greens functions of composite operators.

let us consider the case the current j 

 is the dilatation current jd

 (x) = x t(x). applying

the ward identity (21) for the case of 2-point functions we get

hjd

 (x1)oi (x2)oj (x3)i = (d  i )((d)(x12) + (d)(x13))

ij c2(g, i )

(x2

23)i

(22)

since the distribution 1/(x2)i is not well-dened for i = d/2 + k, k = 0, 1, 2.., there may be
additional ultralocal terms on the r.h.s. of the renormalized ward identity (22). as jd
 (x) is
related to t (x), these terms should follow from a proper renormalization of the 3-pt function
htoioji. the conformally invariant 3-point function of the energy momentum tensor and
two scalars is uniquely determined from conservation, symmetry and tracelessness to be

ht 
the relations in (26) should be satised by the fully renormalized 3-pt function (23). now, (23)
is not well-dened when i = d/2 + k, k = 0, 1, 2, .. as it has short-distance singularities when

(x1)oi (x2)oj (x2)i = (d  i )h(d)(x12)hoi (x1)oj (x3)i + (d)(x13)hoj (x1)oi (x2)ii .

two and three points coincide. to remedy this, one can use dierential regularization techniques
[34] and write down an expression for the 3-pt function htoioji which coincides with (23)
for separate points but is well-dened at the coincident limits as [3]

this expression is well-dened for all values of i when r(1/x2i ) is dened by (14), (15). the

chosen such the gravitational ward identity is satised as we now show. taking the divergence

4.2 ads computation

we now present a calculation of the conformal anomaly using the ads/cft correspondence.
our starting point is the following adsd+1 action for massive scalar elds i (x0, x) 3 with cubic
vertices

i[i , g] = z dd+1xg(cid:20) 1

(dx0dx0 + dxidxi), with i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
and x = (x0, xi). the boundary of this space is the sphere sd consisting of rd at x0 = 0 and a single point at
x0 = .

for ki,j,k integers one deals with kaluza-klein states. the dimensions of the operators that
form the 2- and 3-point functions in (32) satisfy the condition (6) and they contribute to the
conformal anomaly of the boundary cft.

the inverse of the innitesimal distance 1/ from the ads boundary can be used as an uv
mass-scale  in the boundary theory [38] in accordance with the ideas of holography [39]. in
the limit    (  0) one then obtains from (33) and (34) the renormalized 2- and 3-point
functions of the boundary cft. however, the limit   0 is a delicate procedure as it is related
to coincident singularities which are in turn related to conformal anomalies. in particular, if
there exist the logarithmic terms in (32) in the limit   0 then, from (5), these would give rise
to conformal anomalies.

it is relatively simple to obtain the -dependence for 2-point functions. to this end we
observe that for integer ki the k-bessel functions in (33) have logarithmic terms as   0 [40].
these terms give rise to -function terms upon evaluating the -derivative of the generating
functional, which in turn yield a non-vanishing trace anomaly in (10) as

5 non-renormalization theorems in n = 4 sym

we comment in this section on the application of our results to n = 4 sym theory. n = 4
sym theory is most succinctly described in harmonic superspace [41, 5]. the ym multiplet, i.e.
6 real scalars i in the 6 of the global symmetry group su (4), 4 weyl fermions a
 in the 4 of
su (4) and a vector eld a, is described by an analytic supereld w taking values in the adjoint
of su (n ). w is a covariantly analytic supereld. the explicit form of the constraints can be
found, for example, in [5, 42]. as it was shown in [42] (see also [43, 44]) the short multiplets of
n = 4 sym have a description in terms of the analytic superelds ap = trw p, where the trace
is over the color indices. the lowest component of this supereld is ai1...ip = tr{i1...ip}-traces.
in [19, 25], 2- and 3-point function were determined directly in analytic superspace by solving the
n = 4 superconformal ward identities. it has been established there that these ward identities
uniquely determine all 2-point function and 3-point functions up to a constant. therefore, it
is sucient to know the correlation functions of ai1...ip in order to determine the correlation
functions of all n = 4 chiral primary operators. for these operators, our theorem is directly
applicable.

in a number of recent papers [2325], the non-renormalizability of 2- and 3-point functions
of chiral primary operators was linked to a bonus u (1)y symmetry that n = 4 sym is expected
to have in a specic limit. however, the arguments in [23, 24] did not take into account possible
contact terms in correlation functions. such local terms do not respect the bonus u (1)y , so even
if the selection rules advocated in [23, 24] hold (away from coincidence points), this does not
imply non-renormalizability of 2- and 3-point functions of chiral primary operators. however,
such conclusion would be correct if one could show that the local terms saturate by tree-level
contractions.

let us review the argument of [23]. the ads/cft duality connects n = 4 su (n ) sym with
string theory on ads5 s5. the latter has a non-perturbative sl(2, z) symmetry. this symme-
try is enhanced to sl(2, r) in the limit where supergravity is valid. in particular, the theory has
an extra u (1)y symmetry, the latter being the maximal compact subgroup of sl(2, r). string
corrections and higher dimension operators break this symmetry, so the bonus u (1)y cannot be,
and it is not, a symmetry of n = 4 sym theory. however, operators can be assigned a denite
u (1)y charge: f, , and  have u (1)y charge equal to -2, -1 and 0, respectively (f is the
anti-self dual part of the eld strength, see below). the complex conjugate elds have opposite
u (1)y charge. it was argued in [23] and perturbatively checked in a number of cases [24], that
2- and 3-point functions exactly satisfy a selection rule that follows from u (1)y . in particular,
all 2-point and 3-point functions with at least two protected operators can be non-zero only if
their charges sum up to zero. however, contact term contribution to the correlation function
need not respect the u (1)y selection rule.

let us consider the pure yang-mills sector of the n = 4 theory for the moment. the

to raise and lower indices using the north-east convention for both undotted and dotted indices.

the argument of [23] has as follows. according to the selection rules proposed there, if
the correlation function in the l.h.s.
is
necessarily zero since, because the operator o has u (1)y charge equal to -4, it cannot be that in
both sides the u (1)y charges sum up to zero. however, the selection rules can be, and actually
are violated by contact terms (as it has already been observed in [24]). one can ignore contact
terms in the l.h.s. by taking all operators at separate points, but this cannot be done in the
r.h.s as one integrates over the insertion point of o (z). in fact, the tree-level contributions to
these contact terms complete the  -derivative into a modular covariant derivative.

we now calculate these local terms. in the feynman gauge, the gauge eld propagator reads

 (x1)ab

haa

 (x2)i = ig2

y m abcc  (x1  x2)

where (x1  x2) satises (x1  x2) = (x1  x2). from here it follows that

ab(   +   )(x1  x2)

from (41) follows that tree-level contractions between the operator o and some other

operators o simply counts, up to the factor of ig2

if we take all xi and yi to be at separate points, the tree-level contribution to the correlation
function is non- zero only for p = q. in our discussion below we always take the external legs to
be at separate points. the tree-level contribution to (39) reads

before we proceed let us present an example. consider the case of the 2-point function between
o and o . then (43) gives the following dierential equations for the arbitrary coecient c  
of the 2-point function,

going back to (43), we observe that the combination d = i(  i 2p

that involves o yields

the modular covariant derivatives act in a way which is consistent with the assignment of weight
(2, 0) to every factor of o present in the correlation function, and weight (0, 2) for every factor
of o . the relation (43), (45) can be compactly expressed as (with the understanding that only
correlation function with external legs at separate points are considered)

d z[j,  ] = d z[j,  ] = 0,

(46)

where j collectively denotes the sources for the composite operators. it may seem surprising at
rst that all correlation functions are covariantly constant w.r.t. the modular group. however,
this has a rather simple explanation. the calculation only uses data that come from the quadratic
action (38). this action is identical to the action describing n1 copies of maxwell elds. the
relations (46) may be easily shown to hold by noting that (i) the y m is trivial since we consider
the theory on r4, (ii) the gy m dependence is also trivial since one can always rescale away the
coupling constant from a free-theory. in the presence of sources, the source terms will acquire
some g2
y m dependence after the coupling constant has been rescaled away from the kinetic
 f (p,q)(c + d)p(c + d)q,

4a non-holomorphic modular form f (p,q) of weight (p, q) transforms as, f (p,q)

term. the connection piece in (46) simply cancels these terms. it follows that by considering
appropriately normalized operators (in our case o  o
 = o 2) one can completely scale
away the coupling constant from both the kinetic and the source term. then the connection
piece in (46) vanishes as well. since 2 transforms as (1,1) form, o
 transforms as (1,1)
form which are also the weights assigned in [23]. incorporating the scalars and fermions in the
discussion does not bring any qualitative change.

to summarize our discussion: for a free theory, one can rescale away the coupling constant,
and then all correlation functions of (appropriately normalized) operators are independent of
the coupling constant.
in an interacting theory, although one can scale away the coupling
constant from the propagators, the coupling constant will appear through the interactions. this
means that one can always arrange, by considering appropriately normalized operators, such
that the tree-level contact terms in (42) vanish. the non-trivial content of (42) is in possible
loop-contributions. in particular, non-renormalizability of 2- and 3-point functions (or, more
generally, of n-point functions) is equivalent to saturation of (42) by free elds. this is not
guaranteed by the bonus u (1)y symmetry because the selection rules are not respected by
contact terms.

6 summary and outlook

we have presented a non-renormalization theorem for the conformal anomaly in the pres-
ence of external sources for operators with vanishing anomalous dimensions. as an illustrative
example we computed the conformal anomaly associated with 2-point functions, both directly
from cft and also from the ads/cft correspondence and found agreement. the corresponding
3-point function calculations will be reported elsewhere [33]. our results imply that (i) if the
usual relation between the divergence of the r-current and the trace anomaly in supersymmetric
theories is valid in the presence of external sources and (ii) if the former saturates by free-elds,
then the 3-point functions of operators with protected dimensions are non-renormalized. these
two conditions, although seemingly a direct generalization of the ingredients entering the known
supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem of [17], they have not been discussed in the liter-
ature, and therefore they are not guaranteed.

we have also discussed the recent proposal of [23] relating the non-renormalizability of 2-
and 3-point functions to a bonus u (1)y symmetry of n = 4 sym. such a proposal does not
take into account possible ultralocal terms that may appear in conformally invariant n-point
functions in coincident limits. nevertheless, the conclusions drawn in [2325] would be correct
if these contact terms saturate by free-elds.

regarding further development of our work, it is essential that the generalized adler-
bardeen theorem is studied in the presence of external elds in both n = 4 sym and also on
n = 1, 2 theories. also important would be to understand the contact terms in u (1)y invariant

14

2-, 3-point functions and to see whether they saturate by free elds. to this respect, we note
that the niteness of the n = 4 sym may play a crucial role in such analysis. for instance, the
operator o , being a derivative of the lagrangian, does not renormalize. notice also that the
operator o is in the same supersymmetry multiplet with the energy-momentum tensor and the
r-currents, so the answers to the above two questions may be related.
