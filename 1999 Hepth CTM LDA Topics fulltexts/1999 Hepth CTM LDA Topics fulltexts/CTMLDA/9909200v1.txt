consistent perturbative light front
formulation of yang-mills theories

abstract. it is shown how to obtain the consistent light front form quantization of a
non-abelian pure yang-mills theory (gluondynamics) in the framework of the standard
perturbative approach. after a short review of the previous attempts in the light cone
gauge a = 0, it is explained how the diculties can be overcome after turning to
the anti light cone gauge a+ = 0.
in particular, the generating functional of the
renormalized greens functions turns out to be the same as in the conventional instant
form approach, leading to the mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription for the free gluon
propagator.

light front form for free fields

the light front form (lff) formulation1 of eld theories [1] is given in terms of
the evolution parameter x+, the light front time, and the volume coordinates
x = (x, x), which label the light front space. the lff formulation of gauge
theories in the light cone gauge a = na = 0, is known since almost thirty years
[2]. this original formulation involves only physical degrees of freedom and, at
the perturbative level, it unavoidably leads to the cauchys principal value (cpv)
prescription for the non-covariant spurious singularity of the free gauge boson prop-
agator: namely,

d+

(x) = iz

[nk]cpv ) ,

where

the limit being understood in the tempered distributions topology.

1) n otations:

v  (v+, v, v), v =

v0  v3
2

, v = (v1, v2) = v.

unfortunately the cpv prescription so roughly violates power counting and
causality, that it even fails to reproduce the correct one loop beta function in
the non-abelian case [3].
it follows therefrom that the original light front form
perturbation theory in the light cone gauge is inconsistent.

on the other hand, it turns out that the usual instant form (if) formulation,
which is in terms of the evolution parameter x0 = ct, the ordinary time, and volume
coordinates ~x for the ordinary space, is fully consistent in perturbative approaches
to gauge theories [4], both in the light-cone gauge a0  a3 = 0 as well as in the
anti light cone gauge a0 + a3 = 0.
free-
dom (ghosts) and canonical quantization necessarily leads to the mandelstam-
leibbrandt (ml) tempered distribution [5] to regulate the non-covariant singu-
larity in the free gauge boson propagator, i.e.,

this if formulation necessarily involves extra unphysical degrees of

(k0  k3)(k0  k3) + i

.

the ml prescription guarantees power counting and causality and in so doing the
if perturbative formulation does fulll renormalizability, unitarity and covariance
of the formal s-matrix elements. the natural question arises: is it possible to nd
some lff formulation which reproduces those remarkable results? for quantum
electrodynamics (the abelian theory) the answer is yes [6], provided we set up
canonical light front form quantization in the weyls gauge a+ = 0. in order to
obtain some consistent lff perturbation theory we have to nd some canonical
lff framework leading to the ml form of the free propagator. the rst attempt
towards this task has been pionereed, in the light-cone gauge, by g. mccartor and
d. g. robertson [7].

their starting point is the free lagrange density

lrad =

f f   na,

in which n = (n+, n, n) = (0, 1, 0, 0). after the introduction of the new eld
variables (a, a+, ) 7 (t, , ), i.e.,

a= t  ,  = 2
a+= 1

  t  +  ,

the equations of motion become

2+t = 2

 =  = 0.

we remark that  and  fulll constraint equations and thereby  and  can not
be quantized on the null hyperplanes at constant x+. owing to this feature, in [7]
some new lff quantization procedure was suggested involving two characteristic

surfaces, i.e., transverse elds t are quantized on null hyperplanes at equal x+,
whereas longitudinal elds  and  are quantized on null hyperplanes at equal
x. the above quantization procedure leads to the light front form canonical
commutation relations listed below

[t(x), t(y)]x+=y+ =
[(x), (y)]x=y = i(x+  y+)2

sgn(x  y)(2)(x  y),
  (2)(x  y),


2i

[t(x), (y)] = [t(x), (y)] = [(x), (y)] = [(x), (y)] = 0.

however, when we compute the lff ordered product

(5)

d+
(x  y)  (x+  y+)h0|a(x)a(y)|0i + (y+  x+)h0|a(y)a(x)|0i ,

(6)

the lff quantization scheme of eqs. (3), (4) and (5) drives to ill-dened convolu-
tion products and not to the ml form of the vector boson propagator. as a conse-
quence, it turns out that the lff quantization of gauge theories in the light cone
gauge a = 0 is indeed troublesome, when choosing x+ as the evolution parameter.
the simplest way to overcome the above barring is the transition to the anti light
cone gauge, or light front form weyls gauge, na = a+ = 0, n  (1, 0, 0, 0).
consider therefore the new lagrange density for the free maxwells radiation eld

lrad = 

1
4

f f   na;

the best way to set up the light front form quantization of the above constrained
system is to follow diracs method [8] of canonical quantization. the free (uncon-
strained) canonical momentum is  = f+, and we have the second class primary
constraints f = 0, as well as the rst class primary constraints + =  = 0.
the canonical hamilton density is

hrad =

1

2 (cid:16)(cid:17)2

+

1
4

ff  a+(cid:16) +   (cid:17) ,

whence we derive the secondary constraints a+ = 0,  +  = . the full
set of constraints is now second class and thereby we can compute equal x+ diracs
brackets, whose explicit form can be found in [6].

after introduction of the new set of variables

a = t  ,
a = 22

 = t,

  t    ,

(7)
(8)

we obtain the genuine equations of motion for all the elds, i.e.,

2+t = 2

t,

+ = + = 0.

the transition to the quantum theory is achieved after replacement of the light
front form diracs brackets with the corresponding light front form canonical com-
mutation relations, which now read the same as in eq.s (3), (4) and (5), but for
the crucial eq. (4) which is replaced by

[(x), (y)]x+=y+ = i(x  y)2

  (2)(x  y).

actually, the quantization characteristic surface is the very same for all the eld
variables, at variance with eq.s (3), (4) and (5). it is convenient to introduce the

longitudinal (unphysical) components of the gauge potential  = (cid:16) + n

it is very easy to verify that the canonical light front form algebra entails

(p, p)i = (2)(k  p)(k  p),

hf (k, k), g(p, p)i = (2)(k  p)(k  p),

all the other commutators vanishing. owing to the lff canonical commutation
relations (13), it is clear that the theory involves an indenite metric space of states
[4], [9] and the physical hilberts subspace vphys is dened through g(k, k)|vi =
0, |vi  vphys. now, taking eq.s (10-13) into account, eq. (6) precisely yields [6]
the standard mandelstam-leibbrandt form of the light front form propagator in
the anti light cone gauge

light-front pure yang-mills theory

let us start now from the su(n)-ym lagrange density

lym = 

1
4 hf , f i  n h, ai ,

in which we understand gauge potentials as well as non-abelian eld strengths
to be su(n)-lie algebra valued elds, h , i being the inner product. in order to
quantize the system we shall follow, as it is somewhat customary in the non-abelian
case, the hamiltonian path-integral quantization [10]. the free (unconstrained)
canonical momentum is  = f+, and we have primary second class constraints
    f = 0 and primary rst class constraints + =  = 0.

the canonical hamilton density is

hym d, +ae + h, +ai  lym

2 d, e +

4 df, f e da+, d + d  e ,

(14)

(15)

with d  1 + ig[a, ]. consequently, we derive the secondary constraints a+ =
0, d + d = , and since we have primary second class constraints  
  da + da = 0, satisfying

with

n(x), (y)o(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x+=y+ = 2d(x  y),

d(x  y)  (1



x + ig[a(x), ]) (3)(x  y),

then the hamiltonian generating functional takes the form

z[j ] = n 1z daddd (cid:16)  f(cid:17) detkdk
exp iz d4xnd, +ae + h, +ai  hym + ha, j io .

(16)

(17)

now the key point: it is well known [11] that within dimensional regularization it
turns out that

and after integration over a+, ,  and  one gets

detkdk|dim reg = detkk,

detkkz dada exp iz d4x
z[j , j ] = n 1
(cid:26)1
4 df, f e + hf, +ai(cid:27)
2 h+a, +ai 
 exp iz d4xnlint + ha, j i +da, j eo ,
where it is convenient to separate the abelian part of the gauge eld strengths
f  a  a, whereas the interaction lagrange density

1

lint(a, a) =

i
2

g h[a, a], fi  ig h[a, a], +ai ,

leads to the conventional feynmans rules for the non-abelian three- and four-gluon
vertices. it follows therefrom that the perturbation theory generating functional
takes the form

z = exp(iz d4y lint*



ij (y)

ij (y)+)z0[j , j ],

in which the free gaussian abelian generating functional reads

4 df, f e + hf, +ai(cid:27)
 exp iz d4xnd, +ae +da, j ) + (a, j eo .

(18)

we have now to show that the above expression (18) for the free generating
functional actually gives rise to the ml form of the free gluon propagator. to this
aim, let us perform the change of variables of eq. (8) in the functional integral, the
corresponding jacobian being j = k2
j = j  + 22

k, together with the sources redenition
  j ,

 = j  + j .

then the free generating functional exactly becomes

and after choosing standard causal asymptotic conditions at x+   for all the
integration eld variables [12], it is not dicult to prove that

z0[j ] = exp

in conclusion, we can say that the light front form perturbative approach in the
light cone gauge a = 0 is still unclear, whereas the lff perturbative approach in
the anti light cone gauge a+ = 0 is fully consistent. in particular, since we have seen
that the light front form and the instant form of the generating functional actually

coincide - they are nothing but the same formal expression, although written using
dierent coordinates systems and after a suitable rearrangement of the external
sources - it immediately follows that the structure of the counterterms is the very
same [4]. it has been quite recently noticed that quark eld can also be included
into the same approach [6], [13]. therefore, after fty years since the original diracs
attempt [1], we have at our disposal a light front form perturbative approach for
gauge theories on equal footing as the standard covariant one, what is a highly
non-trivial achievement. once a completely consistent light front form formulation
has been reached, we can turn now to attack non-perturbative lff open issues
such as, e.g., the light front vacuum structure of gauge theories and the discretized
light front quantization.
