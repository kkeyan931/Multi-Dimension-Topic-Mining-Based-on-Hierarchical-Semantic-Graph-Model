we consider the heterotic string on an elliptic calabi-yau three-fold with ve-branes wrap-

ping curves in the base (horizontal curves) of the calabi-yau as well as some elliptic bers

(vertical curves). we show that in this generalized set-up, where the association of the

heterotic side with the f -theory side is changed relative to the purely vertical situation, the

number of ve-branes wrapping the elliptic bers still matches the corresponding number

of f -theory three-branes.

1. introduction

the compactication of the heterotic string on a calabi-yau three-fold with a vec-

tor bundle over it, which breaks part of the e8  e8 gauge symmetry, leads to n = 1

supersymmetric vacua in four dimensions.

in particular the class of elliptically bered calabi-yau three-folds z has the double

advantage to admit a direct construction of the vector bundles and to allow a dual de-

scription in terms of f -theory compactied on elliptically bered calabi-yau four-folds x

[1].

to obtain a consistent heterotic compactication on elliptic calabi-yau three-folds,

the anomaly cancellation condition requires to include a number af of ve-branes wrapping

the elliptic bers. it has been shown that these ve-branes match precisely the number n3

of space-time lling three-branes necessary for tadpole cancellation on the f -theory side

[1],[2] and so giving a heterotic string explanation of the number of three-branes.

here we will be interested in a slightly more general situation, where one admits also

ve-branes wrapping holomorphic curves in the base b2 of the elliptic calabi-yau three-

fold (we will take b2 to be a hirzebruch surface fn of n = 0, 1, 2 or a del pezzo surface

dpk, k = 0, . . . , 8; the case of an enriques surface could be treated along similar lines).

the picture which emerges is, the ve-branes wrapping the elliptic bers map to the f -

theory three-branes whereas a ve-brane wrapping a curve in the base b2 of the elliptic

calabi-yau three-fold z corresponds to a blow-up of the base b3 along the curve in the

common b2 of the elliptic calabi-yau four-fold x on the f -theory side (recall that b3
resp. x 4 is a p 1 resp. k3 bration over b2).

several aspects of this generalized set-up were discussed in [3],[4], mainly in the case

of wrapping curves of genus zero in the base and in the extreme situation when the bundles

have trivial structure group leading to an unbroken e8  e8 gauge group. the possibility

of wrapping ve-branes on curves in the base (or even in z) was also carefully discussed

with many examples in [5],[6],[7]. note that the g u (1) vector multiplets (g being the genus

of c) coming from reduction of the two-form of self-dual eld-strength on the ve-brane,
are associated with corresponding modes from three-cycles in the blown-up base b3 and

the four-form of self-dual eld-strength of type iib on the f -theory side.

note that a curve lying in the base b will have in general an interesting set of defor-

mations which will play a role below. in the set-up with ve-branes wrapping only bers

the brane-parameters on both sides took care of themselves. remember that the three

1

coordinates of such a three-brane, considered as a point in the p1 bundle b3 over the

visible b2, are simply given by the base-point of the corresponding elliptic ber on the

heterotic side which is trivially given on the common b2 and the third coordinate, i.e.
the fact that there is still a moduli space p1 in the game, is given by a complex scalar
imaginary part is given by the position in the m -theory interval s 1/z2

whose real resp.

in the eleventh dimension resp. the axion a corresponding to the reduction of the self-dual
three-form on the ve-brane (note that this s 1 must collapse to a point at the boundaries

of the interval - thus leading to the third, missing complex coordinate, parametrizing on
the f -theory side the p 1 ber over the common b2 - as there one has a transition to

e8 instantons without the interval position modulus and so without a too (the ve-brane

three-form being odd it must vanish at the orbifold xed planes anyway); cf. [4], [7]). note
also that the heterotic string on a wrapped t 2 is equivalent to the so(32) heterotic string

and a small instanton-vebrane has a non-perturbative su (2) which has as moduli space
on t 2 exactly a p1 (in general an su (n) bundle on t 2 has as moduli space a pn1).

of course the expectation is still that the ve-branes wrapping elliptic bers corre-

spond to the f -theory three-branes and this should not be changed by the occurrence of

the other, horizontal ve-branes. however the actual proof of the matching in the purely

vertical case [1] did not associate these objects directly with each other (although of course

this is the obvious underlying intuition) but rather computed the number of the relevant

ve-branes resp. three-branes independently on both sides in data of the common base b2.

to get the matching one had to use then an association of both sides (this was the relation

1,2 = 6c1(b2)  t, respecting the condition 1 + 2 = 12c1(b2), where t characterizes the
p 1 bration of b3 over b2). but we will have a non-trivial horizontal ve-brane (of class

wb) and so the mentioned condition changes to 1 + 2 + wb = 12c1(b2) on the one hand
and b3 is modied by the blow-up on the other hand. this makes the numerical matching

non-trivial.

in order to proof the matching of vertical ve-branes and three-branes in this gener-

alized set-up we will facilitate the analysis by considering a ve-brane wrapping a smooth

irreducible curve c representing a class wb and thus blow up once the f -theory base
b3. we will separate our analysis into parts starting with the simplest case of a het-

erotic string compactication on z with an e8  e8 vector bundle corresponding under

duality to f -theory on a smooth x (where smooth means that the elliptic bers of x

degenerate in codimension one not worse than i1 in the kodaira classication). after

explaining how a blow-up of wb in the base b3 of x changes the euler number of x

2

and therefore the number of three-branes, we follow the strategy of [1] and express the

number of three-branes and ve-branes in comparable data on the common base b2. then

we proceed to models with an a-d-e gauge group and consider a heterotic model with

an e8  v2 vector bundle where v2 can be e7, e6, su (n) giving corresponding unbroken

gauge groups. the dual f -theory model (assuming no further monodromy eects, which

could alter the gauge group, being present there) is described by compactifying on an x

whose elliptic bers degenerate of type a-d-e . for simplicity we will admit only that
the bers degenerate over codimension one in b3 (which can be done by adjusting the p1

bundle over b2 respectively the  class on the heterotic side). in order to ll out v2 with

enough instanton number (measured by the -bound) we have to perform the wb-shift in
the e8 bundle. one has, just as in the smooth case, again an explicit formula for the euler

number, which was recently proved in [8]. however, as this ansatz is not immediately
adapted to the blow-up procedure which destroys the usual p 1 bration structure of b3,

we will proceed in the proof of the ve-brane/three-brane correspondence more easily by

adopting the strategy of [2]. in the latter one expresses the number of three-branes again

via the euler number, which this time is then in turn expressed by the hodge numbers,

they again by the heterotic data (including the index of bundle moduli inside the com-

plex structure deformations of x); then the close similarity of the expression for the index

of bundle moduli with the expression for the second chern class of the vector bundle is

used to transport directly the number of ve-branes to the f -theory side. we will reduce

our more general situation (wb 6= 0) to this original case (wb = 0) by collecting the
changes in the hodge numbers of the fourfold induced by the blow-up procedure resp. by

the change in heterotic bundle moduli (in a sense made precise below) when transported

to the f -theory side; taken together with the deformations of the chosen curve c these

changes will then cancel out in total.

in section 2 we outline the general procedure of the -shift induced by the occurrence

of a non-trivial wb.

in section 3 we show the three-brane/ve-brane correspondence for the case of a

smooth fourfold.

in section 4 we lay the ground for the treatment of the (codimension one) singular

case. we recall some points of the identication of the moduli spaces and the expression of

the hodge numbers of the fourfold in heterotic data; starting from there we show how this

already gave the result af = n3 in the simple case wb = 0 ([1] showed this in the smooth
case by a dierent procedure; we build on this type of argument in section 3). then we

3

derive the (functional, this will be explained below) change in the index of bundle moduli

under the shift in  by wb.

in section 5 the necessary informations about deformations of c are derived. for this

we investigate the corresponding question for c in the base surface b = b2 and in the

elliptic surface e which lies in z above c.

in section 6 we put our informations about (functional) changes in the hodge numbers

of the fourfold together and show that they cancel each other thereby reducing the proof

of our result to the original case (wb = 0).

2. testing af = n3 with wb turned on

we consider the heterotic string on  : z  b2 with a section  and specify a vector

bundle v = e8  v2 where we x v1 to be an e8 bundle and v2 = e8, e7, e6 or su (n).

under the decomposition h 2(b2) + h 4(b2), where the base cohomology is pulled
back by , the second chern class of v2 respectively the fundamental characteristic class

of e8,7,6 bundles, is given by

(v2) =  + ()

(2.1)

where (v2) = c2(v2) for v2 = su (n) and (v2) = c2(v2)/c with c = 60, 36, 24 for
e8, e7, e6 bundles. note further that   h 2(b2) is arbitrary and   h 4(b2) is deter-

mined in terms of . the explicit expressions for the characteristic classes of e8 bundles

and su (n) bundles are given in [1] for e7 and e6 bundles see [8]. a corresponding de-

composition of the second chern class of z gives

c2(z) = 12c1 + c2 + 11c2
1.

the general condition for anomaly cancellation with ve-branes is

(v1) + (v2) + w = c2(z)

(2.2)

(2.3)

where w is the cohomology class of the ve-branes. as we want to treat the case that

one has, besides some elliptic bers wrapped by ve-branes (the case already treated in

[1]), also a wrapped curve c in the base let us now assume for the ve-brane class a

corresponding decomposition in a part consisting of base cohomology (to be considered

embedded via ) and a ber part

w = wb + af f

(2.4)

4

where w has to be eective [5], which in the cases considered is equivalent to wb being
eective and af  0 [6]. now the h 2(b2) part of (2.4) gives the condition

1 + 2 + wb = 12c1

(2.5)

on the other hand one gets an expression for the number of ve-branes wrapping still just

the elliptic ber of z

af = 12 + 10c2

1  1  2.

(2.6)

this gives also a prediction for the number of three-branes on the f -theory side which is

proportional to the euler number of the calabi-yau four-fold, one has (x)/24 = n3. now
the bration structure of the f -theory base b3 is described by assuming the p1 bundle
over b2 to be a projectivization of a vector bundle y = o  t , where t is a line bundle
over b2 and the cohomology class t = c1(t ) encodes the p1 bration structure. now the
duality with the heterotic side is in the case wb = 0 implemented by choosing the e8  v2
bundle so that the  class of the e8 bundle is given by 1 = 6c1(b2) + t and the  class of

the v2 bundle by 2 = 6c1(b2)  t.

as mentioned, we will now allow ve-branes to wrap a curve c of class wb in the
base b2. this modies the direct relation between the  classes 1,2 = 6c1  t and the p1
bration described by t. we will describe what makes it possible to have still the relation
af = n3. in accordance with condition (2.5)we must deviate from the 1,2 = 6c1  t set-up
by redening

1  1  wb.

(2.7)

before we come to the actual computations let us note that in general the relation for the

number of three-branes will be modied due to the appearance of the f -theory analog of

m -theory four-ux which one is even forced to turn on if (x)/24 is not integral [9],[10].

one has the generalized relation

(x)

24

= n3 +

1

2 zx

g  g.

(2.8)

in particular for su (n) bundles it was expected from an argument given in [11] that
i ), i.e there is a relation between four-ux and discrete twist (which
appears in the su (n) bundle construction). such a relation could be proved indirectly by

g2 = pi

1

2 ( 2

an explicit computation in [8].

since a vector bundle is determined by specifying the  class which has to satisfy

a bound [3],[8],[12] let us note here that (the form of) the bound (for the new ) is not

modied if we include a non-zero wb as discussed in [8].

5

3. the smooth case

as mentioned in the introduction, we consider here the heterotic string on z with an

e8  e8 bundle corresponding to f -theory on a smooth x. in order to perform the -shift

in the vector bundle, let us recall that the fundamental characteristic class of an e8 bundle

is

(v ) =   152 + 135c1  310c2

1

(3.1)

and the anomaly cancellation condition then determines the number of ve-branes af

wrapping elliptic bers of z. now we have two choices to perform the shift either in the

rst or in the second e8 factor. for the shift in 1 we get

af = c2 + 91c2

1 + 30t2 + 15w 2

b  45wbc1  30wbt

whereas for shifting 2 we get

af = c2 + 91c2

1 + 30t2 + 15w 2

b  45wbc1 + 30wbt

(3.2)

(3.3)

which for vanishing wb of course reduces to the known expression derived in [1]. note
that if we perform the shift (assuming here t  0) in 1 the -bound requires wb  c1 + t
whereas for 2 the bound requires t  c1. now if we perform the shift in 2 then the

bound for that bundle requires t + wb  c1 whereas from 1 comes no further condition

to t since 6c1 + t > 5c1.

on the other hand, the number of three-branes n3 = (x)/24 to be included for a

consistent f -theory compactication on a smooth x, as computed in [13], is

n3 = 12 + 15zb3

c1(b3)3.

(3.4)

we will be interested now to see how the eect of wrapping a ve-brane on a curve c in

b2 of class wb on the heterotic side, reected in a blow-up along c in b3, will change the

number of three-branes on the f -theory side. a blow-up of c in b3 produces a three-fold
 : b3  b3 with

c1( b3) = c1(b3)  e

(3.5)

where e denotes the exceptional divisor, a ruled surface over c. it is useful to recall here

that the well known case of a blow-up of a point on a surface leading to an exceptional p1

6

of self-intersection number 1 generalizes to a relation (in h 4( b3)) for the ruled surface

over c (e 3 is here a number which occurs as prefactor of l)

e 2 = wb  e 3 l

(3.6)

where l denotes the ber of the ruled surface e with e  l = 1 (for a proof of this relation

cf. [8]). with this in hand we can proceed and compute the number of three-branes which

are expected to match the af ve-branes. what we nd is

n3 = 12 + 15zb3

c1(b3)3  3wbc1(b3)  e 3.

(3.7)

since b3 is a p1 bundle over b2 obtained by projectivizing a vector bundle, as explained

above, the adjunction formula gives

c1(b3) = c1 + 2r + t.

(3.8)

the triple intersection of the ruled surface e is given by (cf. [8])

e 3 = zwb

c1(nb3 c) = (c1(b3)wb  (c))

(3.9)

c2
1 + c2 for the rational b2 and that r(r + t) = 0 in the cohomology ring

with 12 = rb2

of b3 (i.e. the sections of the line bundles o(1) and o(1)  t over b2 cf.

[1] have no

common zeros) and noting that wb is embedded via wbr into b3 so that the term wbr is

actually wbr2, leading after integration over the p1 bers of b3 to wbt, one gets with

adjunction (c) = wb(wb  c1) the nal expression for the number of three-branes

expressed in terms of b2 data

n3 = zb2

c2 + 91c2

1 + 30t2 + 15w 2

b  45wbc1 + 30wbt

(3.10)

matching the af heterotic ve-branes in case of the shifted 2 (for the 1 shift one has to

replace t by t on the f -theory side).

7

4. the singular case i: comparison of moduli spaces

we will consider here the situation where the bers of the calabi-yau four-fold degen-

erate of type a-d-e over codimension one (actually over b2) in b3 corresponding to an

unbroken gauge group of the same type which on the heterotic side comes from an e8  v2

bundle over z.

the codimension one degeneration is established (cf. [8]) for the a series by setting

t = c1, for the d series only in the case d4 a codimension one condition can be established

for t = 2c1 and for the e series the conditions are t = 3c1, 4c1 for e6 resp. e7.

note that we have to perform the shift always in the e8 bundle since the choice of t

(for codimension one) sets the  class on its lower bound.

now, in the case of a codimension one degeneration of the elliptic ber one can write

down a general expression for the euler number of the corresponding calabi-yau four-fold

(which was rst written down in [14] based there on toric computer analysis and proved

in [8]) and is given by

(x) = 288 + 360zb3

c1(b3)3  r(g)c(g)(c(g) + 1)zb2

c1(b2)2

(4.1)

where r(g) and c(g) denoting the rank and the coxeter number of the a-d-e gauge group

g respectively. if however now one would like to apply the blow-up procedure on the basis

of this formula in order to get the change in the number of three-branes, this could not

be done directly since the bration structure of b3 changes under the blow-up. although

one could rene the derivation of (4.1) in the following we will discuss (as considered in

the introduction) a dierent approach to test af = n3 which will provide us also with the
change in the hodge numbers after the blow-up.

the shift redenition described above for 1 will change of course af and so better n3
too. but this is not the point of what we will follow, as these changes are still captured

by the transport provided by the re-expression (cf. below) between the number of bundle

moduli and the second chern class of v2. what we will follow is how this transport changes.
this is a change caused just by the change in the h 2(b2) part of c2(v2), whereas the
changes which occurs because of just using another 1 occurs in the h 4(b2) part (whose

changing inuence on af is still captured by the original construction).

therefore let us rst recall some facts about the general comparison of the f -theory

and heterotic moduli spaces and spectra. these will provide us with relations expressing

the calabi-yau four-fold hodge numbers in terms of heterotic data. we will then show

8

how these relations have to be modied when on the heterotic side ve-branes wrapping

curves in the base are included.

the moduli in a 4d n=1 heterotic compactication on an elliptic cy, as well as in

the dual f -theoretic compactication, break into base parameters which are even (under

the natural involution of the elliptic curves), and ber or twisting parameters; the latter

include a continuous part which is odd, as well as a discrete part. in [11] all the heterotic

moduli were interpreted in terms of cohomology groups of the spectral covers, and identied

with the corresponding f -theoretic moduli in a certain stable degeneration. for this one

uses the close connection of the spectral cover and the a-d-e del pezzo brations. for the

continuous part of the twisting moduli, this amounts to an isomorphism between certain

abelian varieties: the connected component of the heterotic prym variety (a modied

jacobian) and the f -theoretic intermediate jacobian. the comparison of the discrete

part, involving gamma class and four-ux, renes the matching of af ve-branes and n3
three-branes, as mentioned above.

by working with elliptically bered z one can extend adiabatically the known results
about moduli spaces of g-bundles over an elliptic curve e = t 2, of course taking into

account that such a berwise description of the isomorphism class of a bundle leaves

room for twisting along the base b2. the latter possibility actually involves a two-fold

complication: there is a continuous as well as a discrete part of these data. it is quite

easy to see this for g = su (n): in this case v2 can be constructed via push-forward of the
poincare bundle on the spectral cover c b z, possibly twisted by a line bundle n over
the spectral surface c (an n-fold cover of b2 (via ) lying in z), whose rst chern class

(projected to b2) is known from the condition c1(v2) = 0. so n itself is known up to the
following two remaining degrees of freedom: rst a class in h 1,1(c) which projects to zero
in b (the discrete part), and second an element of jac(c) := p ic0(c) (the continuous

part; the moduli odd under the elliptic involution).

the continuous part is expected [1]to correspond on the f -theory side to the odd mod-
uli, related there to the intermediate jacobian j 3(x) = h 3(x, r)/h 3(x, z) of dimension
h2,1(x), so that the following picture emerges (ignoring the kahler classes on both sides).
the moduli space m of the bundles is bered m  y, with ber jac(c). there is a

corresponding picture on the f -theory side: the moduli space there is again bered. the

base is the moduli space of complex deformations, the ber is (up to the discrete g-ux

twisting parameters) the intermediate jacobian, one has

h2,1(z) + h1(z, ad v ) + 1 = h3,1(x) + h2,1(x).

(4.2)

9

here the number of bundle moduli h1(z, ad v ) = ne +no, even or odd under the involution
coming from the involution on the elliptic ber, can be computed using a xed point

theorem [1] and then rst eectively computing the character-valued index i = ne  no.
so one gets

h1(z, ad v ) = i + 2no

(4.3)

where the index i is given by an integral over the xed point set [1] and can be expressed

in terms of the characteristic class of v (cf. the last section and [15]) (rk = r(v ))

i = rk  4((v )  ) + c1.

(4.4)

note that this expression applies to vector bundles which are invariant under the involution

of the elliptic ber ( -invariant) which is the case for e8, e7 and e6 bundles (whose

characteristic classes (v ) were computed using the parabolic bundle construction which

includes no additional twist which would break the  -invariance); also su (n) bundles

where n is even are  -invariant but bundles with n odd (since one can twist with a line

bundle in the spectral cover bundle construction introducing thereby an additional term

into (v ) ) are in general not  -invariant, however, the codimension one condition on the

f -theory side (specifying t) leads to the vanishing of the additional term in (v ) and in

this case bundles with n odd are  -invariant.

note also that one can give [11] an interpretation of all the bundle moduli in terms

of even respectively odd cohomology of the spectral surface, including an interpretation of

the index as giving essentially the holomorphic euler characteristic of the spectral surface.
more precisely one can identify the number of local complex deformations h2,0(c) of c
with ne respectively the dimension h1,0(c) of jac(c) := p ic0(c) with no.

in this way one gets from a spectrum comparison the following relations [2],[15] (where

we assume that the elliptic ber degenerates over codimension one in b3)

h1,1(x) = h1,1(z) + 1 + r

h2,1(x) = no

h3,1(x) = h2,1(z) + i + no + 1

(4.5)

from these relations one nds (this is recalled briey below) that af = n3 in the case that
all ve-branes wrap elliptic bers only. for this one rst expresses (from the heterotic

identication) the hodge numbers of x purely in data of the common base b2, then one

uses the expression for the index i (cf.

[2]) and nally takes into account that on the

10

f -theory side the h2,1(x) classes correspond to modes odd under the  involution on the

heterotic side.

for this recall that for an su (n) bundle one has [1](cf. below for a discussion of the

inuence of the discrete twisting parameter)

c2(v ) =  

n3  n

24

c1(b2)2 

n
8

(  nc1(b2))

(4.6)

furthermore the index i = ne  no is computed as [1], [11](cf. also the appendix of [8])

i = n  1 +

n3  n

6

c1(b2)2 +

n
2

(  nc1(b2)) + c1(b2)

(4.7)

so that i = i1 + i2 becomes with rk = rk1 + rk2, the sum of the ranks of the two vector

bundles (so that r = 8 + 8  rk is the rank of the unbroken gauge group)

i = rk  4(1 + 2) + (1 + 2)c1

(4.8)

leading with (2.5) to the result indicated above. note that the index for su (n) bundles

was computed in [1] and for e8 bundles in [15].

before we proceed to the renements in the situation wb 6= 0 let us briey recall how

one proceeds from in the argument for n3 = af in the case wb = 0 [2]. from the last

expression for the total index one gets

i = rk  4(c2(v1) + c2(v2)) + 48c1(b2) + 12c2

1(b2)

= rk  4(12c1(b2) + c2(b2) + 11c2

(12  c2

1(b2) + 16  rk + 12 + 29c2

1(b2) + i) = af

(4.12)

so far the original argument. now, in the case wb 6= 0 observe that after the rede-

nition shift has been made, the index i = i1 + i2 can be rewritten as

i = iold  wbc1 = rk  4(1 + 2) + 12c2

1  wbc1

(4.13)

which is the usual index (of course depending now on the new ) shifted by i = wbc1.

in the general case one has besides the geometric and bundle moduli given above

also to take into account the possible deformations defzc of the actually chosen curve c

(which is wrapped by the ve-brane) inside the cohomology class wb = [c] which we are

going to describe now.

5. the singular case ii: deformations of c

we will treat rst the deformations of c in b (always considered to be embedded via

 in z) and in the elliptic surface e lying above c.

note that in the following we will in the case of possible doubt where, like for c, a

self-intersection is to be taken, denote the self-intersection of b considered as a curve in

the surface e by c 2

e to distinguish it from the self-intersection c 2

b2 in b = b2

3 we assume that there is only one cohomologically independent section  of the elliptic bra-

tion  : z  b

4 note that in principle one has in  = =0 

2  2 a  related term which does, in contrast
to 4, not occur in the expression for the index (4.7) (here  is the discrete twisting parameter,

1

cf.

[1],[8],[11], which in some cases even has to be present); therefore this  related term will

also appear besides af in (4.9); nevertheless we have suppressed this term, for we will assume,

as motivated in [11] and indirectly proved for the codimension one singular case in [8], that it

corresponds with a four-ux term on the f -theory side, so that by (2.8) the sought for direct

relation between af and n3 is still maintained.

12

5.1. the deformations of c in b

we have a local information h0(c, nbc) about deformations of c in b as well as a

global one def b2 (c) = h0(b2, o(c))  1. using riemann-roch

2

xi=0

(1)ihi(b2, o(c)) = h0(c, nb2c)  h1(c, nb2c) + (b2, o)

(5.1)

we get (with (b2, o) = 1 from noether for our rational b2)

def b(c) = h0(c, nb2c)  h1(c, nbc) + s  h2(b, o(c))

(5.2)

with the local terms

h0(c, nbc)  h1(c, nbc) =

1
2

(c) + degnbc =

cc1 + c 2

2

(5.3)

let us investigate the two higher cohomological corrections. first for any curve c on a

rational surface b

h2(ob(c)) = h0(o(k  c)) = 0

which can be seen from the exact sequence

0  ob  ob(c)  oc(c)  0

whose associated long exact cohomology sequence reads

(5.4)

(5.5)

0  h0(b, ob)  h0(b, ob(c))  h0(oc(c))

 h1(b, ob)  h1(b, ob(c))  h1(oc(c))

(5.6)

 h2(b, ob)  h2(b, ob(c))  h2(oc(c))    

here vanishing of the last term shown and pg(b) = 0 show together that h2(ob(c)) = 0.
now we have to consider the superabundance s = h1(b, o(c)) for the cases of b =
b2 being a del pezzo surface dpk (p2 blown-up in k points) or a hirzebruch surface
fn (a p1 bundle over p1). the long exact sequence shows with q(b) = pg(b) = 0
that h1(b, ob(c)) = h1(oc(c)) = h0(c, kc  nc/b) which vanishes certainly for 0 >
deg(kc  nc/b) = c(kb + c)  c 2 = ck which is guaranteed if we assume k ample;
thus for b2 = fn with n = 0, 1 and dpk with k 6= 9 the superabundance vanishes.
in
general we have the important consequence

c  c1(b2) > 0  s = 0

(5.7)

13

so that we nd under this assumption

c  c1(b2) > 0  def b(c) = h0(c, nb2c) =

cc1 + c 2

2

.

(5.8)

let us now discuss the case b2 = f2. recall that for fn the kaehler cone (the very ample
classes) equals the positive (ample) classes and is given [17] by the numerically eective
classes xb + yf = (x, y) with x > 0, y > nx where b = b is the section with b2 = n and f
the ber. furthermore note that an irreducible non-singular curve exists in a class xb + yf

exactly if the class lies in the mentioned cone or is the element b = (1, 0) of negative self-

intersection or one of the elements f = (0, 1) or kb+ (with k > 0 and b+ = b + nf = (1, n)
of b2
+ = +n) on the boundary of the mentioned cone; all of these classes together with their
positive linear combinations span the eective cone (x, y  0). note that c1 = 2b+(n+2)f

is positive only for f0 and f1 whereas for f2 it lies only on the boundary of the positive

cone.

for f2 the kodaira vanishing theorem tells us that h1(b, o(c)) = h1(b, o(k c)) =

0 if k +c = (x+2, y +4) is ample, i.e. for y > 2x, x > 2; so clearly the superabundance

will vanish for all ample c = (x, y) (where even x > 0) and for f . note that for f we
see directly that def fnf = 1 = e(f )/2 + f 2 (the expression from (5.3) ) and similarly for
b with n 6= 0 that def fnb = 0 and e(b)/2 + b2 = 1  n  0; so for the case b = f2 the
formal expression which should give the number of actual deformations has to be modied,

and - as this case is in a further respect somewhat exceptional as we will see in the next

subsection - we will exclude it. finally for kb+ one sees that kb+  c1(f2) = 4k > 0 making,

according to the argument given above, s again vanish in this case although c1(f2) is not

numerically eective in general.

5.2. the deformations of c in the elliptic surface e

from the kodaira formula for the canonical bundle of e one has an expression for ke

as a pull-back class (of course also f = 

e p with p  c)

ke = 

e kc + (e, oe )f

(5.9)

then (e, oe ) is via noether evaluated as 1
12 e(e) as c1(e) has, being a certain number
of bers, vanishing self-intersection. but e(e) = c1(b2)  c as the elliptic bration of the

calabi-yau has the discriminant 12c1(b2) so that

(e, oe ) = c1(b2)  c

(5.10)

14

alternatively one can see from adjunction

c(e) = c(c)

(1 + r)(1 + r + 2c1(b2))(1 + r + 3c1(b2))

1 + 3r + 6c1(b2)

that

c1(e) = (e(c)  c1(b2)  c)f

e(e) = 12c1(b2)  c

(5.11)

(5.12)

note that the number d := c1(b)  c has the following important interpretation:

from

(5.9),(5.10) one has ce  c1(e) = ec  c1(b)  cb (as c1(e) is a pull-back class, i.e. a
number of bers) so that with adjunction ec = c 2

e  ce  c1(e) inside e one gets

c 2

e = c1(b)  cb

this gives after (5.7) another important criterion

c  c1(b2) > 0  defe ce = 0

(5.13)

(5.14)

so except for the case b = f2, c = b = b we have no further deformations in the vertical
direction; in the mentioned exceptional case one had e = b  f showing the obvious
deformation. note that in this case we had from the expression (5.3) that e(b)/2 + b2 =

1  2 = 1. as in this exceptional case one has one deformation in z and no deformation

in the base b which the f -theory side could see directly we will exclude it from our nal

arguments.

examples

to give some examples note that the rst three cases d = 0, 1, 2 leading to e(e) =

0, 12, 24 correspond to b  f, dp9, k3. they occur in well-known circumstances if we

choose b2 = fn with n = 2, 1, 0.
c = b = b of self-intersection n of the hirzebruch surface: the rst case gives actually

in that case occurs the mentioned e over the base

one of the two exceptional divisors (the other is the base f2 itself) of the st u calabi-

yau p1,1,2,8,12(24) which consists in a ruled surface over the elliptic ber (this is the just
another way to consider the product b  f bered) [18],[14]; the second case gives the dp9

studied for example in [19], which occurs not just in this set-up but over any exceptional
curve (b2 = 1, b  c1(b2) = 1; rationality and the second property imply the rst) in a del

pezzo base; nally for f0 one gets the well-known k3 bers, which occur of course more

generally also over each ber of any hirzebruch base (adjunction shows d = 2).

15

5.3. the deformations of c in z

the total deformation space can be considered bered together out of the pieces

investigated so far (cf. [7]).

concerning defz c consider

0  nc/b  nc/z  nb/z  oc  0

(5.15)

the last term being again nc/e . to show that h 0(nb/z  oc ) = 0 in order that defcb =
defcz corresponds exactly with the already formulated condition that there are no further
deformations of c in e if c has there (!) negative self-intersection: for degnc/e = c 2
e < 0
and h 0 vanishes just as in the argument for s = 0 given above.

a remark about skew curves

although we will not treat this most general case (where one would have to connect

blow-ups and three-branes on the f -theory side) let us at least point to the possibility

that the total physical moduli space will include even deformations of c + af f away from
the reducibility into base (horizontal) and ber (vertical) curves, leading to curves lying

skew to the elliptic bration.

until yet we have considered two possible cases where a heterotic ve-brane wraps a

curve either of class af f , i.e. of the purely vertical type - a reducible sum of af bers, or
wb, the purely horizontal type wrapping a base curve c. of course that choice of a base
curve realizing the cohomology class wb involves already considerable freedom in itself;
to give an example, for b2 = p2 and wb = 2l one can choose either a smooth conic,
giving a rational curve c of multiplicity 1, or two crossing lines or even two times the

same line, giving a rational curve c of multiplicity 2 (cf. also [4]). what concerns the

distribution of the vertical class af f in a set of curves realizing it, one has considerable
lesser freedom as one can only make the in general disjoint af bers coinciding in some
subsets corresponding to a decomposition of the number af . so the set-up up to now would
lead one in general to consider the wrapping of the reducible curve c + af f . of course
this realizes only a sublocus of very degenerate possibilities for a curve of cohomology class

c + af f as it may be actually possible to nd an irreducible curve (of this cohomology
class) inside z, or more precisely, as we can assume, actually in the elliptic surface e over

c (cf. also [7]).

this is by no means trivial as for example in the case that the base curve c is rational
and that h2,0(e) = 0 resp. 1, i.e. e is either a rational elliptic (dp9) surface or a k3.

16

in that case the class d := c + af f is not representable by an irreducible smooth curve

because, although it is a section of the elliptic bration of e and so rational, adjunction

shows that 2 = d2

e  d  c1(e); but in the dp9 case c1(e) = f and so the right hand side
is 1 + 2af  1, i.e. af = 0, whereas for k3 it is just 2 + 2af showing again af = 0.

here we used the fact that c 2

e = 1, 2 on dp9, k3 as one sees again from adjunction.

note as a nal remark that one has quite a remarkable curve counting. on dp9 one

has for the number n1, of rational curves in the class c + f , as counted by the gromov-
witten invariants and evaluated by mirror symmetry [19], (q = e2i ; e8 ( ), the theta
function of the e8 lattice being given by 1

k( ) = e4( ) with the jacobi theta

functions k and the eisenstein series of weight 4;  is the dedekind eta-function)

2 pk=even 8

n1,q = q

1
2

x

e8 ( )
12( )

(5.16)

corresponding results for c + f with  > 1 are given in [20]. similarly in the k3 ber

p1,1,4,6(12) (of the st u calabi-yau of degree 24) occurring over bers of f2 one has

where

n, = cst u ()

cst u (n)qn =

xn1

e4e6
24 ( )

(5.17)

(5.18)

note that these invariants can be really number of curves or more generally euler numbers

of the deformation space of (or of the moduli space of at u (1) bundles over) the curve

(in general one has to consider a certain obstruction bundle).

in particular they dont

tell us whether there is really an irreducible member besides that curve realization of the

class c + f which is just given by the reducible curve consisting (for  = 1, say) in

the base curve c and a number of  bers. further they dont tell us whether really

a correspondingly big deformation space is realized in the elliptic surface e, let alone

in the calabi-yau three-fold; even if an irreducible skew realization exists this does not

necessarily mean that this realization is connected (in the sense of going smoothly through

supersymmetric realizations) to the reducible realization.

17

6. the singular case iii: computation

by now we are prepared with the necessary background, in order to handle the -shift

and see how the relations for the hodge numbers of the calabi-yau four-fold in terms of

the heterotic data will change. to keep things as clear as possible we will separate the

changes on the heterotic side from those appearing in the calabi-yau four-fold.

heterotic side

on the route of our second strategy we found up to now two important things: the

shift in the index and the expression for the deformation (the unspecied c1 refers to b)

i = cc1

defz c =

c 2 + cc1

2

(6.1)

(concerning the rst relation note that this is the change in the functional form of i as a

function of 1, i.e. for the argument to be given we are not interested in the change coming

from just applying the usual index expression to the new, shifted 1. concerning the second

relation note that, as indicated earlier, we exclude the exceptional case b = f2, c = b.)

f-theory side

on the f-theory side the heterotic -shift is understood as blowing up of the corre-

sponding curve c in the base of the calabi-yau four-fold which leads to a new divisor and

so to a new kaehler class, thus

also, this blow up leads to

h1,1(x)  h1,1(x) + 1

gc =

c 2  c  c1

2

+ 1

new 3-cycles in h2,1(b3) and also in h2,1(x), so

h2,1(x)  h2,1(x) + gc.

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

finally the change in h3,1(x) accounts for both eects, the index-shift i = cc1 (as the

index of the bundle moduli maps to the deformations of the fourfold, cf. (4.5) ) and the

occurrence of the c-deformations (which become geometrical on the f -theory side)

h3,1(x)  h3,1(x)  cc1 + defbc

(6.5)

18

from the relation (4.10) for the number of three-branes we learn that the three changes in

the hodge numbers cancel out since (cf. (5.3))

1  gc  cc1 + defbc = 0

(6.6)

thus, by expressing everything in data of the common base b2, just as it was done in [2],

we nd that the desired matching n3 = af of the number of heterotic ve-branes wrapping
elliptic bers with the f -theory three-branes still holds in the more general situation with

a non-trivial wb, as the -shift reduces this completely to the old argument in the simpler
situation of wb = 0.

let us nally make a remark on the exceptional case. for this let us compute the
prediction for h3,1(x) from the heterotic side in case we have an e8  e8 bundle leaving

no unbroken gauge group (and so having a smooth x on the f side) for the case of

b2 = f2 and wrapping the ve-brane on the base b of f2. let us assume that t = 0
which means we have b3 = p1  f2 on the f -side. since t = 0 we can either perform

the wb shift in the rst e8 or in the second one. the index computation gives for
the unshifted e8 bundle i = 1336 and for the shifted bundle 1216 therefore one has
h3,1(x) = h2,1(z) + i + 1 + defbc = 243 + 1336 + 1216 + 1  1 = 2795. now an
independent computation (using toric geometry) of h3,1(x) [21] matches precisely the

heterotic prediction.

note that we have used here the formal expression for defbc which gives 1 (so
to speak an obstruction) whereas the actual number of deformations of b is 0; further in

z the number is even +1. this shows that this last heterotic deformation in e is, as one

expects, not directly visible on the f -theory side and that on the other hand, concerning

the deformations in the common visible b = b2, the f -theory side sees the obstruction

too, as the 1 is reected there.

we would like to thank a. klemm, d. morrison and j. wahl for discussions.
