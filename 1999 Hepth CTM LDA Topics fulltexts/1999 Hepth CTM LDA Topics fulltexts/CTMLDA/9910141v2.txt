we suggest a closed form expression for the path integral of quantum transition amplitudes. we
introduce a quantum action with renormalized parameters. we present numerical results for the
v  x4 potential. the renormalized action is relevant for quantum chaos and quantum instantons.

1. introduction
the path integral has become a standard method to
quantize classical theories. the class of systems for which
the path integral can be computed analytically is ridicu-
lously small. examples are quadratic lagrangians, e.g.,
for free motion and the harmonic oscillator [1]. let us
consider the q.m. transition amplitude from xin, tin to
xf i, tf i given by

g(xf i, tf i; xin, tin) = z [dx] exp[

in some cases this path integral can be expressed as a
sum over classical paths only

g(xf i, tf i; xin, tin) = x{xcl}

where s[xcl] is the classical action evaluated along the
classical trajectory from xin, tin to xf i, tf i. there may be
innitely many classical paths for a given pair of bound-
ary points (xin, tin), (xf i, tf i) [1,2]. dierent paths then
correspond to dierent values of the action. the factor z
represents some (time-dependent) normalisation factor,
enforced by the unitarity of the amplitude. eq.(2) holds,
e.g., for quadratic lagrangians, where the sum runs over
a single path where the action is minimal. in the case of
the harmonic oscillator v (x) = m

group manifold of su (2) [3]. eq.(2) is a well known but
remarkable result. it is possible that there are other sys-
tems, where the path integral is given by a sum over clas-
sical paths. however, the result is not true in general. a
simple counter example is given by nelson [4].

in the following we will explore if the validity of eq.(2)
can be extended to a wider class of quantum systems, if
we allow the classical action to be replaced by a renor-
malized action. the motivation comes from perturbative
renormalisation in q.f.t. recall that a theory is called
renormalizable, if a xed nite number of counter terms
of the action allows to make the q.f.t. nite to any given
order. the renormalized action is dierent from the bare
action, due to quantum loop corrections, which exist for
interacting theories. the action and also greens func-
tions have the same structure in its bare and renormal-
ized form. quantum mechanics can be viewed as q.f.t.
in 0 + 1 dimension. here we suggest for q.m. the exis-
tence of a renormalized/quantum action, which describes
the transition amplitude (greens function), having the
same structure but parameters dierent from the classi-
cal action.

conjecture: for a given classical action s = r dt m
v (x) there is a renormalized action s = r dt m

which allows to express the transition amplitude by

2 x2
2 x2 v (x),

g(xf i, tf i; xin, tin) = z exp[

s[xcl](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

].

(3)

here xcl denotes the classical path corresponding to the
action s, such that the action s(xcl) is minimal (we
exclude the occurrence of conjugate points or caustics).
z denotes the normalisation factor corresponding to s.
eq.(3) is valid with the same action s for all sets of
boundary positions xf i, xin for a given time interval
t = tf i  tin. the parameters of the renormalized action

depend on the time t . the renormalized action con-
verges to a non-trivial limit when t  . any depen-
dence on xf i, xin enters via the trajectory xcl. z depends
on the action parameters and t , but not on xf i, xin.

why is such result of physical interest? (i) having con-
structed the action s gives a closed form solution for the
path integral. (ii) the action s denes a renormalized ac-
tion in q.m. (iii) gutzwillers trace formula [5] has been
used widely to study quantum chaos in a semi-classical
regime (e.g. highly excited states in atoms). eq.(3) es-
tablishes a simple relation between the transition am-
plitude and some action s which mathematically has the
form of the classical action. eq.(3) allows to dene quan-
tum chaos in an unambigous way. (iv) eq.(3) allows to
study quantum descendents of classical instanton solu-
tions. we have no proof of this conjecture. however, we
will give numerical evidence in support of the conjecture.
we will elaborate on the topic (ii), while (iii,iv) will be
discussed in another letter.

2. construction of renormalized action
we know the quantum action for the harmonic oscillator.
what does perturbation theory predict for the quantum
action in the presence of a small anharmonic perturba-
2 x2 + v (x),  << 1? using
the saddle point method one obtains up to order o(2)

where g(t, t) denotes the euclidean greens function.
this shows that the quantum action contains terms be-
yond that occuring in the classical action.

in the following we want to determine numerically the
renormalized action, eq.(3), for the case of a quartic po-
tential. in this work, we search for renormalized parame-
ters, neglecting potential terms higher than fourth order
in a rst step. this search requires to calculate the tran-
sition amplitude, eq.(1). we have chosen to compute the
path integral via monte carlo with importance sampling.
this requires to go over to imaginary time (euclidean
path integral) t  it. then eq.(1) becomes

ge(xf i, tf i; xin, tin) = z [dx] exp[

h

xf i,tf i

xin,tin

se[x]](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the euclidean classical action is given by se =

2 x2 + v (x). correspondingly, eq.(3) becomes

xin,tin(cid:21) , (4)
e](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where the euclidean quantum action is given by se =
2 x2 + v (x). the transition to imaginary time causes
r dt m
a sign change of the mass term, besides that the action
parameters keep its absolute and relative values. in the
sequel of the paper we will work in imaginary time. we
drop the subscript e in what follows.

we consider a particle of mass m moving in the pres-
ence of a local potential v (x), given in polynomial form
v (x) = pn
n=0 vnxn, with the parameters m, v0, . . . , vn .
we write the potential of the quantum action v (x) =
pn
n=0 vnxn, being parametrized by m, v0, . . . , vn . we
choose a value for the time t and a set of bound-
ary points {x1, . . . , xj}. for all pairs of xin, xf i from
that set we compute the euclidean transition amplitude
gij  g(xi, xj, t ). we denote the euclidean action s
along its classical path xcl by ij = s[xcl]|xi,t
xj ,0 . be-
cause z does not depend on xin, xf i, we subsume it into
ij = ij  ln z. then eq.(4) takes the form
sub

gij = exp[ sub
ij ],

i, j = 1, ..., j.

(5)

while the quantum action has n + 2 parameters, eq.(5)
represents j 2/2 + o(j) independent equations to deter-
mine the quantum action. we have chosen a larger num-
ber of equations than parameters (over-determined) re-
quiring that the error in eq.(5) becomes globally mini-
mal. i.e., we make a 2-t,

2 = xi,j=1,..,j

(gij  exp[ sub

ij ])2/2
ij,

which is a function of the parameters of the quantum
action. a solution for the quantum action is considered
as consistent, if we nd the same action parameters for
dierent sets of boundary points.

3. numerical results
we have computed the euclidean propagator in two
ways: (i) we use monte carlo with importance sampling.
the trick is to write the propagator matrix element as a
ratio of two path integrals. this corresponds to splitting
the action s = s0 + s1, chosen such that the path inte-
gral for s0 is analytically known, exp[s0/h] is treated
as weight and exp[s1/h] is treated as observable. (ii)
according to the feynman-kac formula, the propagator
for large time is asymptotically given by the ground state
contribution. we have solved the stationary schrodinger
equation, computing a number m (of lowest lying) en-
ergies and wave functions, and expressed the propagator
as a spectral sum over those states.

(a) to test our algorithms, we considered the har-
monic oscillator v (x) = v2x2, v2 = 1/2 (with param-
eters m =  = h = 1). the classical path, the transition
amplitude and the renormalized action are analytically

2

known, giving s = s. the results are found within sta-
tistical errors to be consistent with s = s.

(b) next we have considered the quartic interaction
v (x) = v4x4, v4 = 1, with parameters m = h = 1.
we have computed numerically the ground state energy,
egr = 0.667986, and the variance of the ground state
wave function, vargr = 0.287333. from those we intro-
duce dynamically a time scale and a length scale (cor-
responding to the bohr radius), tsc = h/egr = 1.497,
lsc = vargr = 0.5360. we have computed the prop-
agator for 0 < t < 2 via monte carlo runs with
ntherm = 4000, nskip = 2000 and nconf = 1000. for

t > 1 we also computed the propagator by solving the
stationary schrodinger equation and calculating the wave
function and energy of the lowest m states of the spec-
trum. we used m = 30 for 1 < t < 2 and m = 7
for t > 2. we used up to 20 000 mesh points to solve
the classical equation of motion in the determination of
s[xcl]. for the time interval t = 0.5, the numerical re-
sults are shown in tab.[1]. the following observations
are made: (i) the linear and the cubic renormalized po-
tential term are compatible within statistical error with
the value zero, expected from parity conservation of the
quantum system.

(ii) the renormalized action generates a quadratic po-
tential term, absent in the classical action. with respect
to variation of the interval, most coecients vary very lit-
tle and are compatible within statistical errors with each
other. the quadratic term is more sensitive, showing
uctuations from its average value of up to two standard
deviations. in general we nd for j = 6 that the numer-
ical values of 2 lie in the order of the value 2 = 36,
which means that the ts are acceptable. we found that
the intervals, where the algorithms work, lie in the range
of [1.0, +1.0] to [3.6, +3.6]. if the interval is too small,
with boundary points xi << 1, then the potential terms
x2 and x4 are dicult to distinguish. on the other hand,
if the interval is too large, with boundary points xi >> 1,
then the observable exp[x4] (of the monte carlo algo-
rithm) becomes very small. in the renormalized action
the quartic term dominates strongly over the quadratic
term, which makes the latter dicult to discriminate.
stability of the renormalized parameters under variation
of the interval of boundary points has been observed also
for other values of the time t . the dependence on t is
shown in fig.[1]. the error bars are estimated systemat-
ical errors (statistical errors of monte carlo data are of

the size of symbols). we distinguish three regimes: (i)
0 < t << tsc, (ii) t  tsc, and (iii) t >> tsc. for
t close to zero, the renormalized parameters are close
to those of the classical action. an exception is v4 at
t = 0.1, which is about 10% o the classical value. we
believe that this does not reect physics but is a fault due
to limited numerical precision (recall that the propagator
becomes (xf i  xin) when t  0). at about t  tsc,
m, v2 and v4 change noticeably. for large t >> tsc the
renormalized parameters converge asymptotically. when
increasing t beyond tsc one observes that the stability of
results requires an exponential increase in the number of
mesh points. this can be traced to the fact that the clas-
sical trajectory covers several orders of magnitude (and
the order increases with t ). this observation, similar to
critical slowing down observed in simulating critical phe-
nomena in lattice eld theory, puts an upper limit on the
time parameter used in this investigation (t  5).

4. interpretation
how can we understand the behavior of the renormalized
parameters? why does the renormalized action depend
on t ? consider the n-point function of a scalar eld,

3

 =< vac|t.o.((x1) (xn)|vac > .

this is the vacuum expectation value of a time-ordered
n-fold product of the eld. it corresponds to the transi-
tion from the physical vacuum at t = , to the physical
vacuum at t = + with intermediate creation (annihi-
lation) of particles at t1, , tn. in order to obtain nite
expressions, one introduces a regularisation parameter,
say . then  = (xi, ), i.e.
the result depends on
. in q.m., we consider the propagator from xin, tin to
xf i, tf i, t = tf i  tin. the analogue in q.f.t. is

< vac, t = t|t.o.((x1) (xn)|vac, t = 0 > .

then the n-point function (xi, , t ) depends also on
the time t . the computation of renormalized parame-
ters from (xi, , t ) then gives mass, coupling constants
etc. as function of t . thus it is no surprise that the
renormalized parameters in q.m. also depend on t .

carlo (dots and circles) and by stationary schrodinger
equation (other symbols).

how can we understand the behavior of the renor-
malized parameters changing qualitatively in the inves-
tigated time interval? (i) for suciently small t , one
has s < h, i.e. we are in the quantum regime. however,
according to dirac [6] (see also ref. [1]), exp(is/h) is a
good approximation of the propagator g, when the time
interval t over which g is supposed to propagate goes to
zero. this is consistent with our numerical observation
s  s in this regime. (ii) for suciently large time t
one has s > h, i.e. one is in the semi-classical (wkb)
regime.
in imaginary time, the feynman-kac formula
describes the propagator asymptotically,

g(xf i, t ; xin, 0) t  gr(xf i) exp(egrt /h)gr(xin).
for the harmonic oscillator (egr = h/2) one can show

v0 t  egr.

(6)

for the quartic potential one observes also a smooth be-
havior of v0. we have tted v0 by the function a + b/t .
we obtain v0  0.6686, compatible with eq.(6). then
using the denition of the renormalized action, eq.(4),
splitting the renormalized action into a v0 part and a
rest, and using the feynman-kac formula implies

this is a strong indication (no proof) that the renormal-
ized parameters of s converge asymptotically in t . this
is what has been observed in the data. it corresponds in
q.f.t. to the innite volume limit.

in conclusion, we have computed numerically for the
quartic potential a quantum corrected action, and nd
parameters being quite dierent from the classical val-
ues. hence, quantum uctuations can change the clas-
sical behavior drastically. this has been observed (in
preliminary results) also for the instantons solutions of
the double well potential.
