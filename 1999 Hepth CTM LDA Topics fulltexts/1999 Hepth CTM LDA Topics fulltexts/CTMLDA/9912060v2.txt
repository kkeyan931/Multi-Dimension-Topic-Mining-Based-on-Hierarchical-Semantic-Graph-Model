abstract

we consider an especially simple version of a thick domain wall in
ads space and investigate how four-dimensional gravity arises in this
context. the model we consider has the advantage, that the equivalent
quantum mechanics problem can be stated in closed form. the potential
in this schrodinger equation suggests that there could be resonances in
the spectrum of the continuum modes. we demonstrate that there are
no such resonances in the model we consider.

i. introduction

recently it was discovered that four-dimensional gravity can be realized on a domain wall

in ve-dimensional space-time [1] (for a review on domain walls see [2]). the concrete exam-

ple studied in ref. [1] involves two regions of ads5 glued together over a four-dimensional

minkowski slice. the uctuations of the gravitational eld include a single normalizable

zero mode, which gives rise to four-dimensional gravity on the domain wall. since the am-

bient space is non-compact, there is a continuous spectrum of massive modes. normally

this results in ve-dimensional gravity being restored, but if the ambient space is a suitable

slice of ads, this does not happen. the couplings of the extra modes to matter on the do-

main wall are suciently suppressed that integrating over all of them still gives a subleading

contribution to the gravitational interaction between test masses on the domain wall. the

original proposal was formulated in pure ve-dimensional gravity. various extensions to

domain walls in gravity coupled to scalars [3,4], time dependent cosmological scenarios [5],

higher dimensional embeddings [6], and models with mass gaps for the continuum modes

[7,8] have appeared in the literature. several supergravity solutions related to the model of

[1] are known [9], but the original model does not have a supersymmetric extension [10].

in this note we consider a solution of ve-dimensional gravity coupled to scalars, which

also does not have a supersymmetric extension1. our solution can be interpreted as a thick

domain wall interpolating between two asymptotic ads5 spaces, which makes it a non-

singular version of the setup in [1].

it is interesting to investigate how four-dimensional

gravity arises on non-singular domain walls, since they are a more realistic implementation

of the scenario in ref. [1].

thick domain walls are easy to construct, but all explicit solutions we are aware of are too

complicated for analytical computations. our solution is simple enough that the equivalent

quantum mechanics problem can be given in closed form. the potential in the equivalent

quantum mechanics problem has the form of a shallow well separated from the asymptotic

region by a thick potential barrier. a natural question is whether there are resonances (or

quasi-stationary states) in such potentials. from the point of view of a four-dimensional

observer, these states would give a quasi-discrete spectrum of low mass kk states with

unsuppressed couplings to matter on the domain wall. this should be contrasted with the

couplings of non-resonant modes which are small since they have to tunnel through the

potential barrier. if such resonant states exist, they change the physics a four-dimensional

observer sees. in order to address questions of this type it is convenient to have a closed form

expression for the quantum mechanics problem. in this note we discuss one such example

and nd that there are no resonances of the type described above. thus we conclude that

the mechanism for localizing gravity on a thick domain wall is exactly the same as in the

thin wall case of [1].

in section ii we give a quick review of gravity coupled to scalars and outline a method

for nding solutions following [4]. we use it to nd a particularly simple thick domain wall

solution. in section iii we study uctuations of the gravitational eld around our solution

and describe how bulk modes interact with matter on the domain wall.

ii. gravity coupled to scalars

in order to ensure four-dimensional poincare invariance we assume that the metric takes

the form

ds2 = e2a(r) dx2
0 

dx2

yields a solution. this very useful rst order formalism for obtaining solutions to the equa-

tions of motion appeared rst in the study of supergravity domain walls [11] and was gen-

eralized in [12,4] to include non-supersymmetric domain walls in various dimensions.

to study domain wall solutions we have to choose a scalar potential with several minima.

a domain wall solution is characterized by a function (r) that asymptotes to dierent

minima of the potential as r  . in general (r) is smooth and contains a length scale
that corresponds to the thickness of the wall.

it is straightforward to nd such solution to the equations of motion. some examples

are discussed in [11,4] and many others can be constructed along the same lines. however

most of these solutions yield equations that are too complicated for an analytical treatment

in closed form. in this note we present a very specic example of a thick ads domain wall,

where most of the calculations can be done analytically.

(r) = 6b arctan(cid:18)tanh(cid:18)cr

2 (cid:19)(cid:19) ,

where we have set an integration constant that corresponds to a shift in a(r) to zero. for

r   we have a(r)  bc|r|, so the metric, eq. (2.1), reduces to ads far from the
domain wall at r = 0. generic ads domain wall solutions have two free parameters, one for

the asymptotic ads curvature and another for the width of the wall. in the solution above

the ads curvature is given by bc and the thickness of the wall is parametrized by c.

iii. metric fluctuations

in gravity coupled to scalars one cannot discuss uctuations of the metric around the

background given in the previous section without including uctuations of the scalar as

well. the general treatment of these uctuations is rather complicated, since one has to

solve a complicated system of coupled dierential equations. however, there is a sector of

the metric uctuations that decouples from the scalars [4], and these uctuations can be

treated analytically.

for the metric uctuations we adopt a gauge such that the perturbed metric takes the

form

ds2 = e2a(r)(ij + hij)dxidxj  dr2,

(3.1)

where i = 0, ..., 3 and ij = diag(1,1,1,1). it is straightforward but tedious to obtain
the coupled equations of motion for the scalar uctuation, , and hij [4]. in order to prove

stability of the solution given in the previous section, we would have to show that there are

no negative mass solutions to these equations. unfortunately, this is a rather daunting task,

and we will not attempt it here.

the transverse and traceless part of the metric uctuation, hij, decouples from the scalar

and satises a much simpler equation of motion [4]

r + 4ar  e2a2(cid:17) hij = 0,
(cid:16)2

(3.2)

where 2 is the four-dimensional wave operator. in [1] it proved useful to recast this equation

5

in a form similar to schrodingers equation. to that end we change coordinates to z =

r ea(r)dr. the metric takes the form

ds2 = e2a(z) dx2

0 xi

dx2

i  dz2! .

and the wave equation for the transverse traceless parts of hij reads

z + 3a(z)z + 2(cid:17) hij = 0.
(cid:16)2

making the ansatz hij = eikxe3a/2ij(z), this equation simplies further to

(cid:16)2

z + vqm (z)  k2(cid:17) (z) = 0,

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

where we have dropped the indices on (z) and introduced the potential vqm = 9

4 a(z)2 +

3

2a(z).

using eq. (2.9) and the denition of the new variable z we nd z = r dr2b coshb(cr).

for integer b these integrals are easy to do, but if b is even the inversion is never possible

in closed form and for odd b inverting the expression for z requires solving a degree b

polynomial equation. in the following we will set b = 1. the b = 3 case is also tractable,

but the resulting equations are much more complicated and the qualitative behavior of the

solution is the same as in the b = 1 case.

note that setting b = 1 leaves only one free parameter, c, which controls the ads

curvature and the thickness of the domain wall. with b = 1, we cannot take the thin wall

limit without sending the ads curvature to innity at the same time. since we are interested

in studying thick walls, this is not a serious handicap.

for the b = 1 solution we have a(z) =  ln(4 + c2z2), which gives

vqm =

3c2
4

(8 + 5c2z2)
(4 + c2z2)2 .

(3.6)

the spectrum of eigenvalues, k2, give the spectrum of graviton masses a four dimensional

observer at (or near) z = 0 sees. in order to have a four dimensional graviton as in [1] the

lowest eigenfunction of eq. (3.5) should have eigenvalue k2 = 0. we nd one normalizable

eigenfunction given by 0 = n/(4 + c2z2)

4 , where n is a normalization constant. 0 is

the lowest energy eigenfunction, because it has no zeros. thus there is no instability from

transverse traceless modes with k2 < 0.

since the potential vanishes for large z, this is the only bound state. the wave functions

for k2 > 0 become plane waves at innity. we were not able to nd exact solutions of

eq. (3.5) for k2 > 0, but qualitatively the process of localizing gravity on the domain wall

is quite clear.

as in [1] any k2 > 0 is allowed, so the masses of the extra modes are continuous from

zero. normally this indicates that gravity is actually ve-dimensional, but for the thin ads

domain wall the couplings of these modes to matter on the domain wall are suppressed

enough that they do not spoil four-dimensional gravity. we now discuss this somewhat
mysterious behavior in our non-singular setup. let vmax  c2 be the maximum of the
potential shown in fig. 1. for modes with energies (masses) k2  vmax, the potential
is a small perturbation. these modes couple to matter on the domain wall with regular

strength, but since they are heavy, they yield subleading corrections to four-dimensional

gravity mediated by the zero mode.

modes with k2  vmax could potentially exhibit a resonance structure. such resonant
modes would have a disproportionately large amplitude in the interior of the domain wall,

while the amplitude of non-resonant modes should be much lager outside than in the interior.

since we do not have a solution for the continuum modes in closed form, we are forced to

fig. 2. wave functions for moderate k2 (rapidly oscillating) and small k2 (half period). the

wave functions are shown in the unphysical normalization (0) = 1.

investigate this question numerically. this analysis is simplied greatly by having a closed

expression for the potential eq. (3.6).

numerically integrating eq. (3.5) for various values of k2 we nd no evidence for a

resonance structure in the spectrum of the continuum modes. fig. 2 shows a mode with

moderate k2 and one with very low k2. modes with intermediate values of k2 smoothly

interpolate between the two solutions shown. we have adopted the unphysical normalization,

(0) = 1. to convert to the physical normalization, we use plane wave normalization for the

wave functions at large z. with this normalization the wave function for small k2 is strongly

suppressed at the origin. since the coupling of a mode with mass k2 to matter located at

or near z = 0 is given by the amplitude of the properly normalized wave function there,

the modes with small k2 are essentially decoupled from the physics on the domain wall.

furthermore, the wave function at the origin decreases monotonically as we lower k2. just

as in the thin wall case of [1], there is no evidence for a resonance structure in the continuum

modes. this is true both for the b = 1 and the b = 3 solution, but it is not clear if this is

a generic feature of thick ads domain walls, or a special property of our simple examples.

in any event we conclude that there are thick domain walls on which the four-dimensional

eective theory has a spectrum that is qualitatively very similar to the thin wall case.

it is interesting to see how our solution reduces to the thin wall solution of [1]. we have

only one parameter that controls both the thickness of the wall and the ads curvature. the

limit c   sends the width of the wall to zero and the ads curvature to innity. clearly

8

classical gravity is not adequate to describe the physics in this limit, but as a consistency

check we can still compare eq. (3.5) to the corresponding equation in [1]. we expect these

equations to agree in the high curvature limit. we nd for z 6= 0

vqm (z) =

15
4z2 .

(3.7)

this agrees with the large curvature limit of the potential given in [1] for z 6= 0, and solving
eq. (3.5) with this potential yields the bessel functions found in [1]. we cannot check that

the singular piece in the potential of [1] comes out correctly, because that requires rst

taking the width of the wall to zero and then sending the curvature of ads to innity. our

solution only allows us to take a special correlated limit, so we do not expect the singular

part to agree. finally, in our setup modes with masses up to mmax  c are suppressed on the
domain wall. mmax becomes innitely large in the limit c  , so we recover uncorrected
four-dimensional gravity. correspondingly, we nd that the corrections from bulk modes in

the thin wall solution of [1] vanish as the ads curvature goes to innity.
