abstract

the quantum mechanics and thermodynamics of su(2) non-abelian chern-simons
particles (non-abelian anyons) in an external magnetic eld are addressed. we derive the
n-body hamiltonian in the (anti-)holomorphic gauge when the hilbert space is projected
onto the lowest landau level of the magnetic eld.
in the presence of an additional
harmonic potential, the n-body spectrum depends linearly on the coupling (statistics)
parameter. we calculate the second virial coecient and nd that in the strong magnetic
eld limit it develops a step-wise behavior as a function of the statistics parameter, in
contrast to the linear dependence in the case of abelian anyons. for small enough values
of the statistics parameter we relate the n-body partition functions in the lowest landau
level to those of su(2) bosons and nd that the cluster (and virial) coecients dependence
on the statistics parameter cancels.

i. introduction

identical particles with statistics continuously interpolating between bose-einstein and
fermi-dirac statistics exist in two and one dimensions. explicit implementations of these
ideas can be found in the two-dimensional anyon model [1] and in the one-dimensional
calogero-sutherland models [2] where a dierent approach to statistics proposed by hal-
dane based on a generalized pauli exclusion principle [3] is realized.

contrary to the n-body calogero model, which is solvable, the n-anyon spectrum
is still unknown. however, a simplication arises when considering the anyon model in
the background of an external magnetic eld. by projecting this model onto the lowest
landau level, a procedure which is justied in the strong eld-low temperature limit, a
complete eigenstate basis, which continuously interpolates between the bosonic and the
fermionic basis, can be found in the screening regime where the ux  carried by the
anyons is antiparallel to the external magnetic eld b. more precisely, when the statistics
parameter  = /o, which varies from  = 0 to  = 1, is such that   [1, 0] if
eb > 0, or equivalently   [0, 1] if eb < 0.

in this situation, the statistical mechanical properties of the anyon gas can be studied
in a complete and explicit way [4] and they turn out to be quite similar to those of the
calogero model. in the thermodynamic limit both models are microscopical realizations
of haldane statistics [3,5,6]. recently, various conformal eld theories have also been
shown to implement exclusion statistics [7].

it is well known that anyons can be thought of as bosons or fermions coupled to abelian
chern-simons gauge elds. an interesting generalization occurs when the gauge elds
take values in a non-abelian group and the particles carry internal degrees of freedom
associated with a representation of this group. these models describing non-abelian
chern-simons particles have already been considered in several contexts. verlinde [8]
argued that they provide an explicit realization of non-abelian braiding statistics, i.e.
statistics corresponding to non-abelian irreducible representations of the braid group [9].
field theoretical implementations of such models were recently proposed [10] as ginzburg-
landau chern-simons theories for pfaan (non abelian) quantum hall states. they
generalize abelian chern-simons eld theories [11] for laughlin (abelian) quantum hall
states.

whether models of non-abelian chern-simons particles restricted to the lowest lan-
dau level can be solved exactly (a natural possibility since they become eectively one-
dimensional), and whether their thermodynamics yield a realization of exclusion statistics
dierent from that corresponding to abelian anyons, are questions of interest. in this pa-
per, we address these questions by studying the simplest case of a non-abelian symmetry,

2

namely su(2) chern-simons particles in the fundamental representation. the paper is
organized as follows.

in section ii the verlinde model [8], a generalization of the aharonov-bohm hamilto-
nian in the (anti-)holomorphic gauge to the non-abelian case, is introduced. we include
contact 2(zi  zj) interactions to enforce that the wave functions are regular when par-
ticles approach each other, and, in addition, a conning harmonic potential to lift the
lowest landau level degeneracy. we redene the wave function essentially as  = u,

where u (the non-abelian generalization of qi<j(zi  zj) for abelian anyons with statis-

tics parameter ) is a solution of the knizhnik-zamolodchikov equation. our main result
is the hamiltonian acting on , which takes particularly simple form when  is (anti-
)holomorphic, that is when the hilbert space is restricted to the lowest landau level of
the external magnetic eld. in the latter case we nd a linear dependence of the n-body
energy spectrum on the statistics parameter, generalizing the known results for abelian
anyons.

in section iii we revisit both the abelian and non-abelian anyon models to present
another derivation of the same hamiltonian acting on  as in section ii, but now starting
from free pauli hamiltonians. in this approach, contact interactions do not need to be
introduced, instead the spin coupling plays a crucial role. we also show that in the
redenition of the wave function the external magnetic eld and the magnetic uxes
carried by particles can be treated on the same footing. the latter point of view is more
adapted for models that use mean eld approximations [12].

in section iv we discuss the 2-body problem for an arbitrary strength of the external
magnetic eld. the 2-body problem decomposes into two abelian anyon problems, which
allows one to calculate the second virial coecient exactly.
in the vanishing magnetic
eld limit our result reduces to that found previously by hagen [13] in his comment on
the paper by lee [14]. in the strong magnetic eld limit we nd that the interpolation
from bose to fermi statistics is dierent from the abelian one.
in the latter case [4],
which yields haldanes generalization of the pauli exclusion principle, the second virial
coecient depends linearly on the statistics parameter. contrary to that, we nd that
in the non-abelian case the second virial coecient develops a step-wise behavior as a
function of the statistics parameter.

in section v we address the n-body problem in the lowest landau level. we show how
to calculate the partition function taking into account properly degeneracies associated
with internal isospin degrees of freedom. the n-body energy spectrum for a given isospin
is the n-body su(2) bosonic spectrum plus a a term linear in the statistics parameter.
we relate the n-body bosonic partition functions zn,i with total isospin i to the partition
functions associated with young diagrams. the latter partition functions, which turn out

3

to be generalizations of the schur functions, are introduced in subsection v b. we propose
systematic rules to calculate them. collecting all these results, we can calculate the cluster
and virial coecients one by one. for small enough values of the statistics parameter we
nd, somewhat surprisingly, a cancellation of the dependence on the statistics parameter,
and thus the same cluster and virial coecients as for su(2) bosons. the n-body lowest
landau level thermodynamics of non-abelian chern-simons particles in the entire interval
of denition of the statistics parameter is yet an open question.

we conclude in section vi, and comment also on generalizations to other symmetry
groups and relations to one-dimensional integrable models with inverse square interac-
tions. in appendix a some basic facts used in the paper on the irreducible representations
of the symmetric group are collected.

ii. the abelian anyon model and non-abelian verlinde

model

a. abelian case

let us begin with reviewing the formalism used in [4] to calculate the equation of
state of abelian anyons in the lowest landau level of an external magnetic eld. the
dynamics of n anyons in the plane is described by a aharonov-bohm hamiltonian in the
background of a constant magnetic eld b. here, as in the sequel, the mass m will be set
to 1 and complex coordinates notation zi = xi + iyi, zi = xi  iyi will be used. for our
purposes, it will be convenient to work in the holomorphic (+) or anti-holomorphic ()
gauge where the aharonov-bohm hamiltonian takes the form

h0 = xi

(i 

i + 

i i )

the covariant derivatives are dened as,

with

i = i  ikzi 

i = i  ikzi

k +

zi = ixj6=i



zi  zj  ixi

bzi k +

zi = 0

kzi = ixj6=i



zi  zj

+ ixi

bzi kzi = 0

,

the charge e of each anyon is coupled to the aharonov-bohm ux  carried by the other
anyons and to the external magnetic eld b: therefore the couplings  = e/2 and
b = eb/2.

we are interested in a boson-based description of anyons, that is, the hamiltonian (1)
is acting on bosonic wave functions (z1, .., zn ; z1, .., zn ). then, the statistics parameter
  [1, 1] is such that  = 0 corresponds to bosons and  = 1 to fermions.

it is also possible, via a singular gauge transformation, to formulate the problem in
terms of a free hamiltonian, that is without anyonic aharonov-bohm elds, at the
expense of introducing multivalued wave functions

u+h +

0 u1

(i i + ii  2bzi i  b)

uh0 u1


(i i + ii + 2bzii + b)

+ = xi
= xi

with u satisfying the equations

iu+ = xj6=i



zi  zj

u+

iu+ = 0

iu = xj6=i



zi  zj

u

iu = 0

which can be considered as the abelian version of knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations [15],
with solutions

(8)

(9)

(10)

u+ = yi<j

(zi  zj)

(zi  zj)

u = yi<j
iu 6= iiu.

note that due to the multivaluedness of u, i
h0 have singular terms which arise from

i(

1
zi

) = i(

1
zi

) = 2(zi)

however, a potential accounting for repulsive contact interactions (which are introduced
in order to implement the exclusion of the diagonal of the conguration space) and a har-
monic well (which is introduced as a regulator to calculate thermodynamical properties)
can be added to (1)

v = xi,j6=i

2(zi  zj) +xi

2
2

zizi

.

5

(11)

if we choose  = ||, the contact term in v cancels exactly the singular terms in h +
(h0 ) when  < 0 ( > 0). the total hamiltonian hab = h0 + v becomes
i  j
zi  zj

(13)

the role of contact interactions in the context of anyons has been extensively discussed in
the literature. their relevance has been originally stressed in the study of soliton solutions
in chern-simons matter systems [16] and anyonic wave functions in the background of
an external magnetic eld [17] (see also [18]). the issue was subsequently re-considered
by several authors, in the perturbative treatment of the aharonov-bohm problem [19],
perturbative calculations of statistical and thermodynamical quantities [20], self adjoint
extensions [21], etc. notice that in the case under consideration the contact interactions
are repulsive and that in addition, the orientation of the external magnetic eld and the
anyonic ux tubes are opposite, a case which do not support solitons [22]. on the other
hand, this is precisely the case considered in [4] since it allows for a physical meaningful
lowest landau level reduction.

then, if  = 0, the ground state of h +

ab, which corresponds to b > 0 and  < 0, is
given by analytic wave functions while the ground state of hab, associated to b < 0 and
 > 0, is given by anti-analytic wave functions.

as we mentioned before, the harmonic attraction lifts the degeneracy of the ground

state. in order to see this, it is convenient to re-dene the wave functions as

(z1, .., zn ; z1, .., zn ) = yi

exp(

t  b

2

zizi)(z1, .., zn ; z1, .., zn )

(14)

where t  2 + b2. the hamiltonian acting on  is then

which do vanish at coinciding points.

b. non-abelian case: the verlinde model

let us generalize the above construction to su(2) non-abelian chern-simons particles
in the lowest landau level of an external abelian magnetic eld. we are considering the
case where n identical bosonic particles are in the isospin 1/2 fundamental representation
of su(2). the wave functions of the system (z1, .., zn , z1, . . . , zn ) belongs to the tensor
product 1...n where i is the two-dimensional space in which the su(2) generators,

t a
i =

a
i
2

a = 1, 2, 3

i = 1, .., n

(22)

act. the non-abelian generalization of the aharonov-bohm hamiltonian in the holomor-
phic and anti-holomorphic gauges is given by,

h0 = xi

(i 

i + 

i i )

(23)

where we the covariant derivatives are dened as before but with non abelian gauge elds,

k +

zi = igxj6=i

t a
i t a

zi  zj  ixi

kzi = igxj6=i

t a
i t a
j
zi  zj

+ ixi

bzi kzi = 0

,

(25)

here g is the chern-simons coupling constant (g = 1/2 in [14]) and satises the topo-
logical constraint g = 2/n with n an integer.

naturally, other choices such as coulomb or axial gauges are possible. the connection
among these dierent gauge choices is obtained via w 1h0w where w is not necessarily
unitary. unlike the abelian case where w is known, for the non-abelian case an explicit
expression is available only in the 2-body case.

the hamiltonian acts on totally symmetric wave functions with bosonic interchange
conditions, meaning that the wave function is symmetric under the interchange of both
coordinates and isospin indices,

i1,..,im,..,il,..,in (z1, .., zm, .., zl, .., zn ) = i1,..,il,..,im,..,in (z1, .., zl, .., zm, .., zn )

(26)

as in the abelian case, there exists a hamiltonian without anyonic gauge elds but acting
on wave functions with non trivial boundary conditions. this hamiltonian, uh0 u1
 ,
takes the same form than in the abelian case where u satises the non-abelian knizhnik-
zamolodchikov equations

iu+ = u+gxj6=i

t a

iu+ = 0

iu = ugxj6=i

t a
i t a
j
zi  zj

iu = 0

(27)

(28)

as in the abelian case, the hamiltonians h0 have singular terms that can be elimi-
nated by adding an appropriate potential v . thus, as a non-abelian generalization, we
are led to consider hab = h0 + v with

v = |g| xi,j6=i

t a
i t a

j 2(zi  zj) +xi

2

(29)

it can be shown that this potential corresponds to a repulsive interaction in the bosonic
sector. we then obtain

hab = xi  i

iii. the abelian and non-abelian anyon models revisited

in the standard presentation given above of the abelian and non abelian verlinde
anyon models, short range 2(zi  zj) interactions have been added by hand to the non
hermitian hamiltonians expressed in the holomorphic or anti-holomorphic gauges. we
now present another approach to derive the same hamiltonians (32,33), which starts
from free pauli hamiltonians, therefore implying spin coupling to the local magnetic eld
carried by the anyons. in addition, the eigenstates redenitions with respect to the vortex
(short distance) and the magnetic eld (long distance) will be treated on an equal footing.

in the singular gauge, let us start with the free n-body pauli hamiltonians

h +
free = 2

hfree = 2

i i

ii

n

xi=1

n

xi=1

(40)

(41)

where the index  refers here to the spin degree of freedom.
if one considers the additional coupling to an external magnetic eld, then, in the
symmetric gauge,     bz/2 and    + bz/2. of course one could choose other
gauges for the b eld, as the holomorphic or anti-holomorphic gauges, in which case in (40)
  bz,   , and in (41),    +bz,   , which yield basically the hamiltonians
(5,6) discussed above. however, we insist at this point on using the symmetric gauge,
since it is the natural gauge to work with in the presence of the singular aharonov-bohm
ux tubes.

indeed, the anyon model is dened via the non trivial monodromy of the n-body

eigenstates of hfree

free(z1, z2, . . . , zn ; z1, z2, . . . , zn ) = eipk<l

kl(z1, z2, . . . , zn ; z1, z2, . . . , zn )

(42)

where pk<l kl is the sum of the relative angles between pairs of particles. as said before,
(z1, z2, . . . , zn ; z1, z2, . . . , zn ) is by convention bosonic in the regular gauge with the
statistics parameter  = 0 for bose statistics, and  = 1 for fermi statistics.

looking at (42) as a singular gauge transformation, one would obtain, in the sym-
metric gauge, a n-anyon aharonov-bohm hamiltonian in the background of the external

magnetic eld with pi<j 2(zizj) interactions and pi b shifts, induced by the spin

up or spin down coupling to the local magnetic eld of the vortices and the homogeneous
background magnetic eld. the parameter  represents as usual the aharonov-bohm ux
carried by the anyons in units of the quantum of ux.

10

the short range (contact) interactions have to implement the exclusion of the diagonal
of the conguration space (pauli exclusion), and thus have to be repulsive. so, depending
of the sign of , the spin up hamiltonian (40) (  [1, 0]) or spin down hamiltonian
(41) (  [0, 1]) have to be used.

to materialize the short range repulsion in the eigenstates, one proceeds by redening

(z1, z2, . . . , zn ; z1, z2, . . . , zn ) = yi<j |zi  zj| (z1, z2, . . . , zn ; z1, z2, . . . , zn )

(43)

this is nothing but saying that the eigenstates do vanish as quickly as r
ij when particles
i and j come close together (again the  sign has been chosen accordingly to the sign of
). at this point, (42,43) together give

free = yk<l
free = yk<l

(zk  zl) +

  [1, 0]

(zk  zl) 

  [0, 1]

(44)

(45)

where both qk<l(zk  zl) and qk<l(zk  zl) are solutions of the holomorphic and anti-

holomorphic knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations in the abelian case. the non hermitian
hamiltonian acting on  rewrites

h + = 2

h = 2

the external magnetic eld did not yet plaid any role in the eigenstates redenition,
thus the hamiltonians (46, 47) expressed in the holomorphic or anti-holomorphic gauges
with respect to the vortices, but in the symmetric gauge with respect to the external
magnetic eld. also, there is no such singular gauge as (42) for a homogeneous mag-
netic eld. let us however extract from the eigenstates the landau exponential factor
exp( b
one can easily realize by considering the 2-dimensional identity

2pi zi zi). it should be considered on the same footing as qi |zi  zj| in (43), as

in order for (49,50) to be physically meaningful, i.e. short distance vanishing eigen-
states due to the repulsive vortices, and long distance exponential damping due to the
magnetic eld, one concludes that in (49),  < 0, b > 0, whereas in (50),  > 0, b < 0.
in both cases, the local vortices carried by the anyons are antiparallel to the external
magnetic eld, i.e. a screening regime. the resulting hamiltonian in the holomorphic

the n-body spectrum is nothing else but the sum of the 1-body spectra i = (t

iv. the thermodynamics of two non-abelian chern-simons

particles in an external magnetic field

a. virial expansion

in this section, we study the thermodynamic quantities in which anyonic statistics
manifests itself. for this purpose the virial coecients ak, which result from the expansion
of the pressure p in terms of the particle density , can be used

using the cluster expansion,

1
v

ln  = p =

akk

xk=1

ln  =

bkzk ,

xk=1

(68)

(69)

where z = e is the fugacity, it is possible to express the k-th virial coecient in terms
of partition functions zj with j  k. indeed, from
zn zn

 =

(70)

xn =0

it follows that,

considering a harmonic potential as a regulator, the thermodynamic quantities in a
box of innite volume v can be calculated from those in a harmonic well of frequency 
by using the following thermodynamic limit prescription: in the thermodynamic limit,
the cluster coecients bk are obtained from those in the harmonic well b

(74)

where l = eb

2 is the landau level degeneracy per unit volume.

b. 2-body abelian anyon case

let us consider two non-abelian chern-simons particles in an external magnetic eld.
this problem can be solved exactly since it decomposes into two 2-body abelian anyon
problems. we start by discussing the abelian anyon problem paying special attention to
the peculiarities of the strong magnetic eld limit which are important for understanding
the non-abelian case.

the spectrum for the relative motion of two abelian anyons in an external magnetic

eld b and a harmonic well  is

enm = (2n + 1 + |m  |)t  (m  )c ,

nm = ei(m)r|m|ln(tzz) .

(75)

(76)

the spectrum and eigenstates are periodic with period 2 in  since m has to be chosen
to be an even (odd) integer for boson (fermion) based anyons. so one can always restrict
  [1, 1].

in the thermodynamic limit   0, the spectrum and eigenstates rewrite as

m   : enm = (2n + 1)c

nm = zmln(czz)

16

(77)

(78)

or

m   : enm = (2n + 1 + 2(  m))c

nm = zmln(czz)

(79)

(80)

the projection onto the lowest landau level corresponds to n = 0. this implies that
the wave functions are analytic (anti-analytic) for m   (m  ). notice nevertheless
that the projection is not well dened at the bosonic end (when   0+ for boson based
anyons or   1+ for fermion based anyons). indeed, let us look at the ground state
n = 0 in the the boson based description. if   [1, 0], the analytic ground state basis
(78) is complete since then the m = 0 state belongs to this basis. however, if   [0, 1],
the analytic ground state basis is incomplete since the m = 0 state is anti-analytic and
has the energy which varies linearly with , joining the ground state basis when   0+,
as represented in fig. 1.

consequence of the projection onto the lowest landau level which ignores the m = 0
(m = 1) state leaving the ground state -or in other words the vanishing of the gap- in
the boson (fermion) based description for  = 0 ( = 1). these states, when properly
taken into account, smooth the discontinuities as can be seen in fig. 2.

c. 2-body non-abelian problem

consider now the 2-body non-abelian su(2) case. the isospin is either i = 1 (triplet)

1,1 = | + + >

1,0 =

1
2

(| +  > +|  + >)

1,1 = |   >

or i = 0 (singlet)

the wave function is

0,0 =

1
2

(| +  > |  + >) .

1,mi = s

mi (z1, z2) 1,mi , 0,0 = a(z1, z2) 0,0 .

(90)

(91)

(92)

as we have seen above, the action of the hamiltonian on the direct sum of two sectors
i=1  i=0 is diagonal in each sector. the eigenvalues of the operator  are given by

19

(39). thus, with respect to the coordinate part of the wave functions, there is a bosonic
sector for i = 1 and a fermionic sector for i = 0, with statistics parameters g/4 and
3g/4, and degeneracies 3 and 1, respectively. it follows that the second virial coecient
can be expressed in terms of the second virial coecients for abelian anyons as

atotal
2 =

1

4(cid:20)3ab
2(

g
4

) + af
2 (

3g
4

)(cid:21) .

(93)

this result is a generalization for b 6= 0 to the one obtained in [13]. remember that
0 < g < 2: in the fermionic sector, 3g/4 can fall outside the interval of denition [1, 1].
in this case, the abelian second virial coecient should be extended periodically, which
means that (93) can still be used but with 3g/4  3g/4  2. as a consequence, a cusp
appears in the second virial coecient for g = 4/3, as shown in fig. 3.

in the vanishing magnetic eld limit, the second virial coecient interpolates between
its end values for bosons and fermions with two internal degrees of freedom when g varies
from g = 0 to g = 2.

in the strong magnetic eld limit, the lowest landau level second virial coecient

reads if 0 < g < 4/3,

and if 4/3 < g < 2,

a2(g) =

it is close to a step function, changing abruptly near g = 4/3 on an interval of width
 1/(c), from its bosonic end value 1/4l to its fermionic end value 1/4l.

v. the thermodynamics for a n -body non-abelian problem

in a strong magnetic field

we now ask the question about a possible generalization of the 2-body analysis to the

n-body case.

let us rst remind that in the abelian case, from the lowest landau level spectrum
(39,39) one can deduce [4] an equation of state which coincides with haldanes statistics
thermodynamics for a gas of particles whose 1-body spectrum is reduced to a single level
of energy e = c. the virial coecients are

(97)

when  = 1, one recovers a vandermonde determinant built from 1-body landau
eigenstates.
incidentally, in the haldane statistics point of view, when  = m, the
non degenerate ground state coincides with the laughlin eigenstates at the critical lling
cr = 1/m.

a. lowest landau level non-abelian case

for particles with isospin 1/2, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the total
isospin of the system and the young diagram for the isospin wave function [24]. the

21

corresponding young diagrams may have at most two raws, of length n
2  i for
total isospin i and will be d denoted as [( n
2  i)]. since the total wave function
is symmetric under interchange of particles, the symmetry properties of the isospin and
coordinate wave functions are determined by the same young diagram (see appendix a).
the space of solutions of the n-body problem is decomposed into a direct sum of

2 + i and n

2 + i)( n

the number of times the subspace with total isospin i appears in the decomposition (98)

n!(2i + 1)

function for isospin 1/2 bosons is the square of the grand partition function of bosons
without internal degrees of freedom.

the partition functions for su(2) bosons z bosons

are discussed in the next subsection,
where these are related to partition functions associated with young diagrams (see (117)).

b. partition functions associated with young diagrams

we start with a system of identical particles without internal degrees of freedom in a

harmonic well. the single-particle energy spectrum is

 = (t  c)

(104)

with  = 0, 1, 2, . . ., where we have left aside the constant ground state energy shift t
which has no eect on the thermodynamics.

the 2-body wave function of arbitrary permutation symmetry can be represented as
a linear combination of symmetric and antisymmetric wave functions. this corresponds
to decomposition of the set of all possible values of the quantum numbers (1, 2), 1, 2 =
0, 1, 2, . . . for two particles into

1  2

in the 3-body case, a wave function of an arbitrary permutation symmetry can be
decomposed into a sum of wave functions with three types of symmetry, bosonic, fermionic
and mixed. note that there are two (identical) representations of the mixed symmetry and
that these representations are two-dimensional. to discuss decomposition of all possible
values of the quantum numbers (1, 2, 3), for three particles, one should consider standard
young tableaux labeling all possible symmetries of wave functions (see appendix a).

with each standard young tableau we associate a -young tableau which is obtained
by the change i  i for all the numbers inside the standard young tableau. in the 3-body
case, we then obtain four -young tableaux

the above decomposition of the wave function is a decomposition of the regular representation

of s3 into irreducible representations.

the second and third tableaux are associated with the two standard young tableaux for
the states of mixed symmetry.

all possible values of 1, 2, and 3 can be arranged as

1  2  3 ,
1  2 < 3 ,
1 < 2  3 ,

straightforward calculations show that (109) and (110) lead to the partition functions
2q/[(1  q)(1  q2)(1  q3)] and 2q2/[(1  q)(1  q2)(1  q3)], respectively. we associate
these contributions with the second and third -young tableaux, respectively, in fig. 4.
thus the partition function of the young diagram of mixed symmetry is

2(q + q2)

(1  q)(1  q2)(1  q3)

we are now in position to propose general rules to write down partition functions
associated with young diagrams in the n-body case. to this aim, we represent the
partition function associated with a young diagram yn with n boxes as

zyn = dyn

pyn (q)
(q)n

,

(q)n 

n

yk=1
(1  qk) .

(115)

where dyn is the dimension of the irreducible representation of the symmetric group sn
corresponding to the young diagram yn (equal to the number of standard young tableaux
for yn ), and pyn is a polynomial in q. note that the partition functions for n abelian
bosons and fermions read z b

n = qn (n1)/[(q)n ], respectively.

n = 1/[(q)n ] and z f

24

to evaluate pyn (q), to each -young tableau is associated a chain of inequalities for
the integer numbers {1  2  . . .  n} in the following way: if the row containing
the box with j+1 is located below the raw containing the box with j, then j < j+1;
otherwise, j  j+1. let s1, s2, . . . be the positions of the signs < in this chain counted
from the right. then the contribution to the polynomial pyn from a given -young
tableau is qpj
sj . finally, pyn , associated with a given young diagram, is the sum of the

contributions from all -young tableaux for this diagram.

for instance, for (109), s1 = 1, and the contribution to p[21] is q while for (110), s1 = 2,
and its contribution is q2. for the 4 and 5-body cases, explicit expressions for pyn are
given in appendix a.

notice a relation between the partition functions for yn and its conjugated young

diagram yn : if pyn =pkmax

k=1 cyn (k)qk then p yn = pkmax

as a consistency check, all possible partition functions in the n-body case should sum

k=1 cyn (k)qkmaxk.

using the partition functions above we checked using mathematica, up to the 6-body case,
that (116) is indeed valid.

now we consider su(2) bosons. the decomposition of the space of solution of the
n-body problem into sectors with dierent isospins was discussed in the previous section.
taking into account the multiplicity 2i + 1 for isospin i states, the partition function for
su(2) bosons in the isospin i sector(s) can be related to the partition function associated
with the young diagram corresponding to isospin i as follows

z bosons

n,i = (2i + 1)z[( n

2 +i)( n

2 i)] .

note that z[( n
corresponds to taking into account all d[( n
2 i)] sectors of given i in the decomposition
of the space of solutions of n su(2) bosons in calculating their partition functions. one
can check, using (115) and the expressions for the polynomials given in this section and
in appendix b, that (117) leads to the correct expression for the total partition functions
for n bosons (103).

to conclude this section, we comment on the relation between the above partition
functions and the schur functions. schur functions naturally arise for the system of
non interacting particles whose 1-body spectrum is represented by a nite set of levels
1, 2, . . . , m [25]. one denes x1 = e1, . . ., xm = em . then the boltzmann
partition function can be represented as a sum over all irreducible representations  of
sn

d()s(x1, . . . , xm ) ,

(118)

where s(x1, . . . , xm ) are the schur functions associated with the irreducible repre-
sentations  of the symmetric group sn . the case discussed above corresponds to
k = (k  1)(t  c) and m  . we thus observe that the partition functions dis-
cussed in this section are a generalization of the schur functions to an innite number of
arguments corresponding to an innite set of equally spaced 1-body energy levels. these
functions can be used in studies of the statistical mechanics of systems with parastatistics

unlike the abelian case, an explicit expression for the n-body partition functions is
not available. nevertheless, it is possible to construct iteratively the cluster coecients

in the thermodynamic limit, b
k should behave as (t  c)1, i.e. for small  bk should
be proportional to the volume. it is easy indeed to verify that n,i in (37) is such that
the correct thermodynamic limit is obtained.

moreover, n,i is such that, in the cluster expansion, the leading term (tc)1 does
not depend on g what we checked up to the fth virial coecient. this implies that the

26

cluster coecients (and consequently the virial coecients) do not depend on the statistics
parameter. it would be interesting to understand a possible symmetry underlying this
cancellation.

the above results agree with the exact second virial coecient analysis if g is suf-
ciently small, |g|  4/3. however, at g = 4/3 there is a jump in the second virial
coecient. it follows that the n-body spectrum (38) should not be considered as the
correct spectrum for arbitrary g. as we have seen in the 2-body case, a shift in the
statistics parameter had to be done, which in turn lead to the jump in the second virial
coecient. we have not found a generalization of this procedure to the n-body case.

in analogy with the abelian case, we can argue that the spectrum of anyons is indeed
given by (38) if n,i are less than one. under this assumption, it is easy to show that the
cluster coecients bk are independent of g when

0  g

(122)

in this range the cluster coecients are the same as those of su(2) bosons. the behavior
of the cluster (and virial) coecients in the entire interval of the statistics parameter is
yet an open question.

vi. concluding remarks

we have developed a formalism to study the thermodynamics of non-abelian chern-
simons particles in the lowest landau level of an external magnetic eld. we expect that
the thermodynamics of non-abelian chern-simons particles described by hamiltonians
of the type (32,33) and (65,66) with other groups, as well as other irreducible representa-
tions, can be analyzed using the same ideas with minor modications. the hope is that
under some appropriate choices of the non-abelian symmetry one can obtain non-trivial
thermodynamics in the lowest landau level.

in this respect, an attractive possibility would be to use non-abelian symmetries pro-
posed recently in ginzburg-landau chern-simons theories for non-abelian quantum hall
states [10]. an argument in favor of this choice is the new exclusion statistics thermody-
namics found for non-abelian quantum hall states quasiparticles on the edge [27] and for
their bulk counterparts [28]. we plan to address this issue in future publications.

another observation is that the same form of the spectrum, namely a bosonic n-body
spectrum plus a linear term in the statistics parameter, arises in one-dimensional inte-
grable models with inverse square interaction [29]. in those models, the coupling to the
chern-simons eld is replaced by the coupling of the inverse square interaction. the

27

spectrum is then valid in the entire interval of denition of the coupling parameter. it
follows that that the cluster and virial coecients do not depend on the coupling param-
eter in the entire interval of denition of the interaction parameter. it would certainly be
rewarding to nd a symmetry principle underlying this cancellation.

appendix a: young diagrams and irreducible

representations

for completeness we include in this appendix a brief description of the relation be-
tween young diagrams and representations of the permutation group of n particles sn .
in particular we show how wave functions of arbitrary permutation symmetry can be
constructed using young operators.

the irreducible representations of sn can be associated with the partitions of n in

positive integers i,

1 + 2 + ... + m = n ,

1  2...  m .

(a1)

the dierent partitions (a1) can be depicted graphically by means of young diagrams in
which each number i is represented by a row of i cells. the partitions (a1) are usually
denoted by [] = [12...m] where the power is used to indicate the repeated appearance
of the same integer. thus for two particles we have, [] = [2] and [] = [12] associated
with the rst two diagrams in fig a, while for three particles we have [] = [3], [] = [21],
and [] = [13] corresponding to the last three diagrams in fig.a.

fig. 5. young diagrams for two and three particles

28

the number of inequivalent irreducible representations of sn is equal to the number
of dierent young diagrams. in our examples, s2 and s3 have two and three inequivalent
representations respectively. using young diagrams it is also possible to determine the
dimensions of such representations as well as to construct explicitly representations [](p )
of the elements p  sn and the basis vectors. to do that, a standard young tablueax is
dened in which the numbers from 1 to n are distributed among the boxes of a young
tableau in such a way that they increase from left to right along the same row and from
top to bottom along the the same columns. then the dimension of the representation
is equal to the number of standard young tableaux. for example, there is only one
standard young tableau for each of the diagrams in fig a, except for [21], and so they
correspond to one-dimensional representations of the permutation group. the diagram
[21] has two standard young tableaux shown in fig 6, corresponding to a two-dimensional
representation.

where f is the dimension of the representation. these f operators with a xed second
index transform into each other under permutations and form a basis for the irreducible
representation [].

a basis more convenient in physical applications can be obtained by applying the
young operators to a product of one-particle wave functions in the following way. con-
sider a set of n orthogonal functions a(i), where i stands for the sets of variables on
which the a depend, and form the product wave function 0,

0 = 1(1)2(2)   n (n) .

one can then obtain a basis for the orthogonal representations by applying the young
operators to this function

[]

rt = []

rt 0 .

(a5)

where p is understood as acting on the arguments of a. then, the functions []
rt
with a xed second index transform into each other under permutation and form a basis
for a irreducible representation of the permutation group. the young tableau r that
corresponds to the rst index, enumerates the dierent wave functions in a given basis
and characterizes the symmetry under the interchange of arguments. the second index
t enumerates the dierent basis for [] and it can be shown that it characterizes the
symmetry of the wave function under the interchange of the function a.

one can apply the above general discussion to the case of the coordinate wave function
of a 3-body system. consider a coordinate wave function (123)  (r1, r2, r3) (eventually
the product of single particle wave functions, (r1, r2, r3) = (r1)(r2)(r3)). then in
addition to the totally symmetric and totally antisymmetric wave functions,

representation of s3. more precisely, they correspond to [21]

a = 2 having taken 0(1, 2, 3) = | + + >. notice that since there are only two available
states, + and , a = 1 and a = 2 give the same results so that only two independent wave
