abstract

we describe constructing solutions of the eld equations of chern-simons and bf the-
ories in terms of deformation theory of locally constant (at) bundles. maps of at
connections into one another (dressing transformations) are considered. a method of
calculating (nonlocal) dressing symmetries in chern-simons and bf theories is formu-
lated.

introduction

let x be an oriented smooth manifold of dimension n, g a semisimple lie group, g its lie algebra,
p a principal g-bundle over x, a a connection 1-form on p and fa = da + a  a its curvature.
we shall assume that x is a compact manifold without boundary.

a connection 1-form a on p is called at if its curvature fa vanishes,

da + a  a = 0.

(1.1a)

locally eqs.(1.1a) are solved trivially, and on any suciently small open set u  x we have
a = (d)1, where (x)  g. so, locally a is a pure gauge. but globally eqs.(1.1a) are
nontrivial, and nding their solutions is not an easy problem.

it is well known that in the case n = dimrx = 3 eqs.(1.1a) are the eld equations of chern-
simons theory. chern-simons theories describe at connections on g-bundles over 3-manifolds x
and quantum observables of these theories are topological invariants of x [1, 2].

for a generalization of chern-simons theories to arbitrary dimensions, in addition to a connec-
tion a on a g-bundle p  x, one considers a (n  2)-form b with values in the adjoint bundle
adp = p g g. using the elds b and fa, one introduces so-called bf theories [3, 4], for which
the variation of the action w.r.t. b gives eqs.(1.1a), and the variation of the action w.r.t. a gives
the equations

dab = 0,

(1.1b)

where da is the covariant dierential on p . for more details and references see [5].

the purpose of our paper is to describe the full symmetry group of eqs.(1.1) arising as equations
of motion in chern-simons and bf topological theories. under the symmetry group of a system of
dierential equations we understand a group which maps solutions of this system into one another.
only gauge (and related to them) symmetries of eqs.(1.1) forming a small subgroup in the full
symmetry group have been considered in the literature.

in this paper we show how all (dressing) symmetries of eqs.(1.1) can be calculated with the help
of deformation theory methods. in fact, nding solutions and symmetries of eqs.(1.1) will be reduced
to solving functional equations on some matrices. to illustrate the method, we write down some
nontrivial explicit solutions of these functional equations and describe symmetries corresponding
to them.

2 denitions and notation

2.1 some bundles and sheaves

let {pi} be a set of representatives of topological equivalence classes of g-bundles over x. we x
p  {pi} and choose a good covering u = {u,   i} of the manifold x, which is always possible.
for such a covering u each nonempty nite intersection u1  ...  uq is dieomorphic to an open
ball in rn. let f = {f}, f : u  u  g be transition functions determining the bundle p
in a xed trivialization.

recall that a map of a subset u  x into some set is called locally constant if it is constant on
each connected component of the set u . the bre bundle p is called locally constant if its transition
functions {f} are locally constant. all bundles associated to such a bundle are also called locally

2

constant. in the following we shall consider deformations of the locally constant bundle p . they
are described in terms of cohomologies of the manifold x with values in sheaves of sections of some
bundles associated with p . below we introduce these sheaves.

let us consider the bundle of groups intp = p gg (g acts on itself by internal automorphisms:
h 7 ghg1, h, g  g) associated with p . consider the sheaf sp of smooth sections of the bundle
intp and its subsheaf gp of locally constant sections. a section  of the sheaf gp (sp ) over an
open set u  x is described by a collection {} of locally constant (smooth) g-valued functions
 on u  u 6=  such that  = ff 1

 on u  u  u 6= .

we also consider the adjoint bundle adp = p g g of lie algebras and denote by aq

p the sheaf
of smooth q-forms on x with values in the bundle adp (q = 1, 2, ...). the space of sections of the
sheaf aq
p ) of smooth g-valued q-forms a() on
u  u 6=  such that a() = fa()f 1
 on u  u  u 6= . in particular, for global sections
of the sheaves aq

p over an open set u is the space aq

p (u )  (u, aq

p over x one often uses the notation

q(x, adp ) := aq

p (x)  (x, aq

p ).

(2.1)

the sheaf sp (and gp ) acts on the sheaves aq

p , q = 1, 2, ..., with the help of the adjoint

representation. in particular, for any open set u  x we have

a 7 ada = a1 + d1,

f 7 adf = f 1,
b 7 adb = b1,
p (u ), b  an2

p

where   sp (u ), a  a1

p (u ), f  a2

(2.2a)

(2.2b)

(2.2c)

(u ). of course, d1 = 0 if   gp (u ).
p given

denote by i : gp  sp an embedding of gp into sp . we dene a map 0 : sp  a1

for any open set u of the space x by the formula

0 := (d)1,

(2.3)

where   sp (u ), 0  a1
open set u  x by the formula

p (u ). let us also introduce an operator 1 : a1

p  a2

p , dened for an

1a := da + a  a,

(2.4)

p  a2

p (u ), 1a  a2

where a  a1
p and
1 : a1
p are dened by means of localization. finally, we denote by ap the subsheaf in a1
p ,
consisting of locally dened g-valued 1-forms a such that 1a = 0, i.e. sections a  ap (u ) of the
sheaf ap = ker 1 over u  x satisfy eqs.(1.1a).

in other words, the maps of sheaves 0 : sp  a1

p (u ).

2.2

cech cohomology for sheaves of non-abelian groups

let s be a sheaf coinciding with either the sheaf gp or the sheaf sp introduced in sect.2.1. we
consider a good open covering u = {u} of x and sections of the sheaf s over u0  ...  uq 6= .
in the trivialization over uk, we can represent h  (u0  ...  um  ...  uk  ...  uq , s) by
matrices h(k)

0...m...k...q , and in the trivialization over um, h is represented by

h(m)
0...m...k...q = fmkh(k)

0...m...k...q f 1

mk,

(2.5a)

3

where {fmk} are the transition functions of the bundle p . if we do not write a superscript of
sections of bundles then we mean that

h0...q := h(0)

0...q .

(2.5b)

a q-cochain of the covering u with values in s is a collection h = {h0...q } of sections of the
sheaf s over nonempty intersections u0  ...  uq . a set of q-cochains is denoted by c q(u, s); it
is a group under the pointwise multiplication. in particular, for 0-cochains h = {h}  c 0(u, s)
with coecients in s we have h  (u, s) and for 1-cochains h = {h}  c 1(u, s) we have
h  (u  u, s).

subsets of cocycles z q(u, s)  c q(u, s) for q = 0, 1 are dened as follows

z 0(u, s) := {h  c 0(u, s) : hfh1

 = f on u  u 6= },

z 1(u, s) := {h  c 1(u, s) : hhh = 1 on u  u  u 6= }.

it follows from (2.7a) that

hh = 1 on u  u 6= ,

on u.
we see from (2.6) that z 0(u, s) coincides with the group

h = 1

h 0(x, s) := (x, s)

(2.6)

(2.7a)

(2.7b)

(2.7c)

(2.8)

of global sections of the sheaf s. the set z 1(u, s) is not a group if the structure group g of the
bundle p is a non-abelian group.

for h  c 0(u, s),   z 1(u, s) we dene an action t0 of the group c 0(u, s) on the set z 1(u, s)

by the formula

t0(h, ) = hh1
 .

(2.9a)

a set of orbits of the group c 0(u, s) in z 1(u, s) is called a 1-cohomology set and denoted by
h 1(u, s). in other words, two cocycles ,   z 1(u, s) are called equivalent (cohomologous) if

 = hh1


for some h  c 0(u, s), and the 1-cohomology set

h 1(u, s) := c 0(u, s)\z 1(u, s)

(2.9b)

(2.10)

is a set of equivalence classes of 1-cocycles. since the chosen covering u = {u} is acyclic for the
sheaf s, we have h 1(u, s) = h 1(x, s). for more details see e.g. [6, 7].

3 moduli spaces

3.1 flat connections, adp -valued forms and de rham cohomology

we denote by gp the innite-dimensional group of gauge transformations, i.e. smooth automor-
phisms of the bundle p  x which induce the identity transformation of x. put another way, gp
is the group of global smooth sections of the bundle intp [8], and therefore we have

gp = h 0(x, sp )  (x, sp ) = z 0(u, sp )

(3.1)

4

with the notation of sect.2.

p ) = 1(x, adp ) of global sections of the sheaf a1

the space of all connections on p is an innite-dimensional ane space modelled on the vector
space h 0(x, a1
p and therefore the space of at
connections on p can be identied with the space h 0(x, ap ) of global sections of the sheaf ap .
the group (3.1) acts on the space h 0(x, ap ) by formula (2.2a), and we introduce the de rham
1-cohomology set h 1
da;p (x) as a set of orbits of the non-abelian group h 0(x, sp ) in the set
h 0(x, ap ),

h 1

da;p (x) := h 0(x, ap )/h 0(x, sp ) = {a  1(x, adp ) : daa = 0}/gp .

(3.2)

this denition is a generalization to g-valued 1-forms a and the covariant exterior derivative da
of the standard denition of the 1st de rham cohomology group

h 1

d (x) =

{  1(x) : d = 0}
{ = d,   0(x)}

,

(3.3)

where d is the exterior derivative.

remark. for an abelian group g, the group (3.1) of gauge transformations and the set
h 0(x, ap ) are abelian groups. in this case, (3.2) is reduced in fact to the denition (3.3) of the
standard de rham cohomology.

the denition (3.2) is nothing but the denition of the moduli space mp of at connections

on p ,

mp = h 1

da;p (x) = h 0(x, ap )/h 0(x, sp ).

(3.4)

so, the moduli space mp of at connections on p is the space of gauge nonequivalent solutions
to eqs.(1.1a). the moduli space of irreducible at connections (a dense subset of mp ) is a smooth
manifold.

equations (1.1b) are linear in b. for any xed at connection a, the moduli space of solutions

to eqs.(1.1b) is a vector space

ba = h n2

da;p (x) =

{b  n2(x, adp ) : dab = 0}
{b = da,   n3(x, adp )}

,

(3.5)

since solutions of the form b = da are considered as trivial (topological symmetry b 7
b + da) [5].

nontrivial solutions of eqs.(1.1b) form the vector space ba depending on a solution a of
eqs.(1.1a). the space of solutions to eqs.(1.1) forms a vector bundle tp  h 0(x, ap ), the base
space of which is the space h 0(x, ap ) of solutions to eqs.(1.1a), and bres of the bundle at points
a  h 0(x, ap ) are the vector spaces ba of nontrivial solutions to eqs.(1.1b).

notice that the gauge group gp = h 0(x, sp ) acts on solutions b of eqs.(1.1b) by the formula

where g  gp . therefore, identifying points (a, b)  tp and (g1ag + g1dg, g1bg)  tp for
any g  gp , we obtain the moduli space

b 7 adg1b = g1bg,

(3.6)

np = tp /gp

(3.7)

of solutions to eqs.(1.1). the space np is the vector bundle over the moduli space mp of at
connections with bres at points [a]  mp isomorphic to the vector space ba. we denote by [a]
the gauge equivalence class of a at connection a.

5

3.2 flat connections, adp -valued forms and cech cohomology

by using denitions of the sheaves gp , sp and ap , it is not dicult to verify that the sequence
of sheaves

1  gp

i sp

(3.8)

0
 ap

1
 0

is exact. from (3.8) we obtain the exact sequence of cohomology sets [9]

e  h 0(x, gp )

i h 0(x, sp )

0
 h 0(x, ap )

1
 h 1(x, gp )


 h 1(x, sp ),

(3.9)

where e is a marked element of the considered sets, and the map  coincides with the canonical
embedding induced by the embedding of sheaves i : gp  sp .

by denition the set of equivalence classes of locally constant g-bundles over x is parametrized
by the cech 1-cohomology set h 1(x, gp0)  h 1(x, gp ) [6, 9]. the kernel ker  = 1(e) of the
map  coincides with a subset of those elements from h 1(x, gp ) which are mapped into the class
e = [f ]  h 1(x, sp ) of bundles p dieomorphic to the bundle p dened by the 1-cocycle f . in
terms of transition functions {f} in p and { f} in p this means that there exists a smooth
0-cochain  = {}  c 0(u, sp ) such that

f = 1

 f,

(3.10)

i.e. cocycles f and f are smoothly cohomologous (cf. eqs.(2.9b)).

by virtue of the exactness of the sequence (3.9), the space ker  is bijective to the quotient

space (3.2). so we have

mp = h 1

da;p (x)  ker   h 1(x, gp ),

(3.11)

i.e. there is a one-to-one correspondence between the moduli space mp of at connections on p and
the moduli space ker   h 1(x, gp ) of those locally constant bundles p which are dieomorphic
to the bundle p . notice that to f = {1
 f} representing [ f ]  ker  there corresponds a at
connection a = {a()} = {d1

 }  h 0(x, ap ) representing [a]  h 1

da;p (x).

remark. it is well known that the bundle p  x is always dieomorphic to the trivial bundle
x  g if x is a paracompact and simply connected manifold [6].
it is also known that if the
structure group g is connected and simply connected, and dimrx  3, then all g-bundles over x
are topologically trivial, i.e. h 1(x, sp ) = e. in both cases we have

h 1

da;p (x)  h 1(x, gp ),

(3.12)

since now ker  = h 1(x, gp ). the bijections (3.11) and (3.12) are non-abelian variants of the
isomorphism between cech and de rham cohomologies.

the moduli space (3.5) of solutions to eqs.(1.1b) can also be described in terms of cech co-
 } a general solution of

homology. namely, notice that for a xed at connection a = {d1
eqs.(1.1b) has the form

b = b01 = {b()

0 1

 },

(3.13a)

where  = {}  c 0(u, sp ), and b0 is an ad p -valued (n  2)-form satisfying the equation

db0 = 0.

6

(3.13b)

therefore the space h n2
(n  2)th de rham cohomology group

da;p (x) of nontrivial solutions of eqs.(1.1b) is isomorphic to the standard

h n2
d; p

(x) =

{b0  n2(x, ad p ) : db0 = 0}
{b0 = d0, 0  n3(x, ad p )}

(3.14)

for forms with values in the bundle ad p .

formulae (3.13) mean that the space h n2

da;p (x) is the dressed space h n2
d; p

(x), and we have

on the other hand, it is well known that

h n2

da;p (x)  h n2
d; p

(x).

h n2
d; p

(x)  h n2(x, g p ),

(3.15a)

(3.15b)

where h n2(x, g p ) is the (n  2)th cech cohomology group of the manifold x with coecients in
the sheaf g p of locally constant sections of the bundle ad p .

4 construction of solutions

in this section we shall discuss constructing solutions of eqs.(1.1) in some more detail.

4.1 dierential compatibility equations

as before, we x a good covering u = {u} of x, a trivialization of the bundle p over us and
locally constant transition functions {f} on u  u 6= , df = 0, ,   i. any solution of
equations (1.1a) on an open set u (a local solution) has the form

a() = (d)1
 ,

(4.1a)

where (x) is a smooth g-valued function on u. if we nd solutions (4.1a) for all   i, we
obtain a collection  = {}  c 0(u, sp ). if u  u 6= , then the solutions (4.1a) on u and
u are not independent and must satisfy the compatibility conditions

on u  u. from eqs.(4.1) the dierential compatibility equations

a() = fa()f 1


(d)1

 = f(d)1

 f 1



(4.1b)

(4.2)

follow. since we are looking for global solutions a = {a()} of eqs.(1.1a), eqs.(4.2) must be satised
for any ,   i such that u  u 6= .

any global solution of eqs.(1.1b) has the form

b = b0 = {b()

0 1

 } = {b()},

(4.3a)

7

where  = {} satisfy eqs.(4.2), and b0 is an arbitrary (global) solution of eqs.(3.13b). the
compatibility conditions for b() and b() on u  u 6=  have the form

after substituting (4.3a) into (4.3b), we obtain that

b() = fb()f 1
 .

b()
0 = fb()

0

f 1
 ,

(4.3b)

(4.3c)

 f, d f = 0. thus, one can easily construct solutions of eqs.(1.1b) if one
where f = 1
knows solutions of eqs.(1.1a) or (4.2). that is why in the following we shall concentrate on describing
solutions of eqs.(1.1a) and (4.2).

dierential equations (4.2) are equations on 0-cochains  = {}  c 0(u, sp ). we denote
f (u, sp )  c 0(u, sp ). recall that
f (u, sp ) the space of solutions  = {} of eqs.(4.2), c 0
by c 0
according to the denitions of sections 2 and 3, the solution space of eqs.(1.1a) is z 0(u, ap ) 
h 0(x, ap ). restricting the map 0 to c 0

f (u, sp ), we obtain the map
f (u, sp )  z 0(u, ap ).

0 : c 0

(4.4)

it is obvious from eqs.(4.1) that {}  c 0
f (u, sp ) with {h} 
c 0(u, gp ) dene the same solution a = {a()}  z 0(u, ap ) of eqs.(1.1a), which leads to the
bijection

f (u, sp ) and {h}  c 0

z 0(u, ap )  c 0(u, gp )\c 0

f (u, sp ).

(4.5)

the gauge group gp acts on  = {} by the left multiplication:  7 g1 = {g1
 }, g =
{g}  z 0(u, sp )  h 0(x, sp ), and the denition (3.4) of the moduli space of at connections
can be reformulated in terms of the set c 0

f (u, sp ) by using the bijection (4.5).

4.2 functional matrix equations
having a solution  = {} of eqs.(4.2), one can introduce matrices f = 1
 f dened
on u  u 6= . using eqs.(4.2), it is not dicult to show that d f = 0, and therefore f =
{ f}  c 1(u, gp ). moreover, it is easy to see that fs satisfy eqs.(2.7), and therefore { f}
can be considered as transition functions of a locally constant bundle p  x with the canonical
connection a = 0. thus, we obtain a map of the data (f, a) into the data ( f , a = 0), i.e. the
connection a is encoded into the transition functions f of the locally constant bundle p .

let us now consider free 1-cochains f = { f}  c 1(u, gp ) and functional equations

f f f = 1

(4.6a)

on u  u  u 6= . the space of solutions to eqs.(4.6a) is the space z 1(u, gp ) of 1-cocycles.
f (u, gp ) the subset of those solutions f to eqs.(4.6a), for which there exists a splitting
denote by z 1

f = 1

 f

(4.6b)

with some  = {}  c 0(u, sp ). using equations d f = 0, one can easily show that these {}
f (u, sp ). then, by introducing a() = 0 = (d)1
will satisfy eqs.(4.2), i.e.  = {}  c 0
 ,
we obtain a at connection a = {a()} on p . thus, for constructing at connections on p , one
can solve either dierential equations (4.2) on {}  c 0(u, sp ) or functional equations (4.6) on
{ f}  c 1(u, gp ).

8

4.3 solution spaces  moduli spaces

in sections 4.1, 4.2 we showed that for the xed transition functions f = {f} of the locally
constant bundle p there is a correspondence

z 0(u, ap )  (f, a)  ( f , a = 0)  z 1

f (u, gp ),
f (u, gp )  c 1(u, gp ) is
where z 0(u, ap ) is the solution space of dierential equations (1.1a), and z 1
the solution space of functional equations (4.6). these solution spaces are not bijective. namely, to
gauge equivalent at connections a and adg1a = g1ag+g1dg with g = {g}  z 0(u, sp ) there
corresponds the same cocycle f = { f}  z 1
)1fg
 f = f. at the same time, the cocycles f and f h = {h fh1
1
c 0(u, gp ) correspond to the same at connection a.

 } with h = {h} 

f (u, gp ), since f g

 := (g

 = 1

 gfg1

  =

(4.7)

the correspondence (4.7) will become the bijection (3.11) if we shall consider the space of orbits
of the group z 0(u, sp ) = gp (the gauge group of the model (1.1a)) in the space z 0(u, ap ) and
consider the space of orbits of the group c 0(u, gp ) (the gauge group of the model (4.6)) in the
f (u, gp ). in other words, we should consider the pairs (f, [a]) and ([ f ], 0), where [a] is
space z 1
the gauge equivalence class of a, and [ f ] is the equivalence class of the 1-cocycle f . in sect.3 this
correspondence was described in more abstract terms.

we obtain the following correspondence between de rham and cech description of at connec-

tions:

c 0
0 
z 0(u, ap )

 

f (u, sp )

 r
z 1

f (u, gp )
p 

mp =

z 0(u, ap )
z 0(u, sp )



z 1
f (u, gp )
c 0(u, gp )

.

here a map

r : c 0

f (u, sp )  z 1

f (u, gp )

is given by the formula r({}) = {1

 f} = f ,  and p are projections in the bundles

 : z 0(u, ap )  z 0(u, ap )/z 0(u, sp ),

p : z 1

f (u, gp )  c 0(u, gp )\z 1

f (u, gp ),

(4.8)

(4.9a)

(4.9b)

(4.9c)

and the map 0 is a projection in the bundle (4.4).

using a bijection of the moduli spaces of solutions to eqs.(4.2), (1.1a) and (4.6), we identify
f (u, gp ).

f (u, sp ), a  z 0(u, ap ), f  z 1

the points   0(), (a), p( f ) and p  r(), where   c 0
then we have

  0() = (a) = p( f ) = p  r() 

f = s  (a) = r  (a), a =   p( f ) = 0  ( f ),  = (a) = ( f ),

(4.10)

where , ,  and s are some (local) sections of the bundles (4.4), (4.9a), (4.9b) and (4.9c),
respectively. let us emphasize that just the ambiguity of the choice of sections of the bundles (4.4)
and (4.9) leads to the ambiguity of nding f for a given a and a for a given f . as usual, one can
remove this ambiguity by choosing some special sections , ,  and s (gauge xing).

5 symmetry transformations and deformations of bundles

in sect.4 we described the transformation r   : (f, d1) 7 ( f , 0). if we now dene a map
t1 : f 7 f preserving the set z 1
f (u, sp ), then after using the maps   p or 0  , we obtain a new
at connection a. below we describe this method of constructing at connections on p based on
deformations t1 : f 7 f of locally constant bundles.

5.1 cohomological groups acting on solution spaces

for the beginning we shall consider groups acting on the set c 1(u, gp ) of 1-cochains. one of
such groups - the group c 0(u, gp ) - and its action t0 on c 1(u, gp ), z 1(u, gp ) and z 1
f (u, gp )
we have considered in sections 2.2 and 4.3. the action t0 of the group c 0(u, gp ) gives trivial
(gauge) transformations of the transition functions f = { f}, and the space of orbits of the group
c 0(u, gp ) in z 1
f (u, gp ) = ker   h 1(x, gp ).
in other words, the group c 0(u, gp ) is the stability subgroup of the point [ f ]  mp .

f (u, gp ) is the moduli space mp  c 0(u, gp )\z 1

to obtain a nontrivial map of the moduli space mp onto itself, we consider the following action

of the group c 1(u, gp ) on itself:

t1(h, . ) : f 7 t1(h, f ), t1(h, f ) := h fh1
,

(5.1)

where h, f  c 1(u, gp ). recall that h 6= h1
 , and the convention of sect.2.2 for sections of the
sheaf gp implies that h  h()
 , where the superscripts () or () mean that
the section is considered in the trivialization over u or u. from the denition (5.1) it is easy to
see that t1(g, t1(h, f )) = t1(gh, f ) for g, h, f  c 1(u, gp ). moreover, starting from the element
f  c 1(u, gp ), one can obtain any other element of c 1(u, gp ), i.e. the action t1 is transitive.

 and h  h()

we are interested in subgroups of the group c 1(u, gp ) preserving the set z 1

f (u, gp )  z 1(u, gp ) 

c 1(u, gp ). to describe them, we x f = { f} = {1
f (u, gp ) and consider an orbit
of the point f under the action t1 of the group c 1(u, gp ). we want to nd an intersection of this
orbit with the set z 1

f (u, gp ), i.e. the set of all h  c 1(u, gp ) such that

 f}  z 1

(i) f = t1(h, f )  z 1(u, gp ), i.e. the transformation t1(h, . ) : f 7 f preserves eqs.(4.6a),

(ii) f = t1(h, f )  z 1

f (u, gp )  z 1(u, gp ), i.e. the transformation t1(h, . ) : f 7 f preserves

not only eqs.(4.6a), but also eqs.(4.6b).

the condition (i) means that the transformation t1(h,

. ) maps z 1(u, gp ) onto itself, which
is realized, of course, not for any h  c 1(u, gp ). this condition imposes severe constraints on h
which are equivalent to the following nonlinear functional equations:

f f f = 1 on u  u  u 6= ,

(5.2a)

where f := h fh1
this case h = h| := h|uu , h = h| := h|uu .

. notice that eqs.(5.2a) are satised trivially if h  c 0(u, gp ), since in

by introducing  := ff 1

 and using formulae (2.5), we can rewrite eqs.(5.2a) in the form

 ()
()

 ()

 = 1 on u  u  u 6= .

(5.2b)

10

formulae (5.2) mean that  = {} = {()

 } is a 1-cocycle.

the condition (ii) means that for the 1-cocycle f = t1(h, f ) one can nd a splitting like (4.6b),

i.e. there exists a 0-cochain  = { }  c 0(u, sp ) such that

f = 1

 f .

(5.3)

this imposes additional restrictions on h  c 1(u, gp ), and one of their possible resolvings is the
following. recall that for the sheaf s p of smooth sections of the bundle ad p we have h 1(x, s p ) =
0 [7]. therefore for small deformations f 7 f of the cocycle f there always exists  = { } 
c 0(u, sp ) such that (5.3) is satised. as such, we shall consider elements h  c 1(u, gp ) close to
the identity and satisfying eqs.(5.2). in other words, we consider a local group (a neighbourhood of
the identity in c 1(u, gp )) and take only those its elements h which satisfy the cocycle condition
(5.2). if in addition we shall change the initial point f  z 1
f (u, gp ) for the action t1, then in
the described way we shall obtain all elements of the group of bijections of the set z 1

f (u, gp ).

5.2 dressing transformations
in sect.4 we have described maps a 7 f and f 7 a, where a = d1  z 0(u, ap ), f =
{ f} = {1
in sect.5.1 we described the map
t1(h, . ) : f 7 f = {h fh1
f (u, gp ) if elements h = {h }  c 1(u, gp ) satisfy
some conditions. then having found  = { } by formula (5.3), we introduce

f (u, gp ),  = {}  c 0

}, where f  z 1

 f}  z 1

f (u, sp ).

a() := (d ) 1
 .

(5.4)

from the equations d f = 0 and eqs.(5.3) it follows that s satisfy eqs.(4.2), and a()s satisfy
eqs.(4.1b), i.e.

a() = f a()f 1
 ,
 = f(d ) 1

(d ) 1

 f 1



(5.5a)

(5.5b)

on u  u 6= . thus, if we take a at connection a = {a()} and carry out the sequence of
transformations

(5.6)
we obtain a new at connection a = { a()}. notice that by virtue of commutativity of the diagram
(4.8), one can consider the map s   instead of r   and the map   p instead of 0  .

(f, a)

r
7 ( f , 0)

t17 ( f , 0)

7 (f, a),

it is not dicult to verify that

a = { a()} = {a()1

 + d1

 } = a1 + d1,

(5.7a)

where

 := 1 = { 1

(5.7b)
formally (5.7) looks like a gauge transformation. but actually the transformation ad : a 7 a
dened by (5.7) consists of the sequence (5.6) of transformations and is not a gauge transformation,
since  6= ff 1
 on u  u 6= . recall that for gauge transformations adg : a 7 ag =
gag1 + gdg1 one has g = fgf 1
 , i.e. g = {g} is a global section of the bundle intp , and

 } = {}  c 0(u, sp ).

11

 = {} is a collection of local sections  : u  g of the bundle intp which are constructed by
the algorithm described above.

from formulae (3.13), (4.3) and (5.7) it follows that the dressing transformation ad acts on

any solution b of eqs.(1.1b) by the formula

ad : b 7 b = { b()} := {b()1

 } = b1,

(5.7c)

where  = {} is dened in (5.7b). the eld b is a new solution of eqs.(1.1b). as shown above,
the transformation ad is not a gauge transformation.

let us emphasize that  = {} depends on h  c 1(u, gp ) dening the transformation
. ) : f 7 f , and taking this into account we shall write   (h) = {(h)}. the
t1(h,
transformations (5.7) will be called the dressing transformations.
in this terminology we follow
the papers [10, 11], where the analogous transformations were used for constructing solutions of
integrable equations. it is not dicult to show that these transformations form a group.

notice that the maps (5.6) are connected with maps between the bundles (p, f ), ( p , f ) and
( p , f ). all these bundles are dieomorphic, but not isomorphic as locally constant bundles. a
dieomorphism of p onto p is dened by a 0-cochain  = {}  c 0
f (u, sp ), and a dieomorphism
of p onto p is dened by  = { }  c 0
f (u, sp ). moreover, the bundles p and p become
isomorphic as locally constant bundles after the restriction to u  u 6= : p |uu  p |uu ,
but these isomorphisms are dierent for u  u with dierent ,   i. in other words, h :
p |uu  p |uu dene local isomorphisms that do not extend up to the isomorphism of p and
p as locally constant bundles over x.

5.3 a special cohomological symmetry group

matrices h = {h}, dening the dressing transformations

ad(h) : a 7 ah := (h)a(h)1 + (h)d(h)1,

ad(h) : b 7 bh := (h)b(h)1,

(5.8a)

(5.8b)

must satisfy the nonlinear functional equations (5.2) that are not so easy to solve. however, there
exists an important class of solutions to these equations, which can be described explicitly. the
merit of these solutions is the fact that they do not depend on the choice of cocycles f and f .

notice that eqs.(5.2) with all indices written down have the form

h|

f| h1

| h|

f| h1

| h|

f| h1

| = 1,

(5.9)

where h| means the restriction of h dened on u  u to an open set u  u  u and
it is not dicult to verify that a collection h = {h} 
analogously for all other matrices.
c 1(u, gp ) of matrices such that

h| = h|,

h| = h|,

h| = h|

(5.10)

satises eqs.(5.9) for any choice of 1-cocycles f = {f} and f = { f}.

12

the constraints (5.10) are not very severe. they simply mean that sections h of the sheaf

gp over u  u 6=  can be extended to sections of the sheaf gp over the open set

u = [
,i

u  u,

(5.11)

where the summation is carried out in all ,   i for which u  u 6= . in other words, from
(5.10) it follows that there exists a locally constant section hu : u  g of the bundle intp such
that h = hu |uu [7]. in this case we can identify h = {h} = {hu |uu } and hu . such h
form a subgroup

c 1(u, gp ) := {h  c 1(u, gp ) : h| = h| on u  u  u 6= }

(5.12)

of the group c 1(u, gp ).

now let us consider c 1(u, gp ) as a local group, i.e. let us take h from the neighbourhood of the
identity in c 1(u, gp ). for such h there always exists   c 0(u, sp ) such that (5.3) is satised and
one can introduce (h) by formula (5.7b). notice that this map  : c 1(u, gp )  c 0(u, sp )
is a homomorphism. using (h), we can introduce a new at connection ah = ad(h)a =
(h)a(h)1 + (h)d(h)1 and a new solution bh = ad(h)b = (h)b(h)1 of eqs.(1.1b) for
any h  c 1(u, gp ).

6 conclusion

in this paper, the group-theoretic analysis of the moduli space of solutions of chern-simons and bf
theories and dressing symmetries of their equations of motion was undertaken. we have formulated
a method of constructing at connections based on a correspondence between the non-abelian de
rham and cech cohomologies. the full symmetry group of the eld equations of chern-simons and
bf theories and the special cohomological symmetry group have been described. at least a part of
the described symmetries (e.g. the special symmetries) can be lifted up to symmetries of quantum
chern-simons and bf theories. it would be desirable to describe and analyze representations of
these symmetry groups.
