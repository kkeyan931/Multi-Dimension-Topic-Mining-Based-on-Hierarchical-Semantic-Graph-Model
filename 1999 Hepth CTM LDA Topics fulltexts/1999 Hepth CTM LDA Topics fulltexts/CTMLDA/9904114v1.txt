abstract

we use a recently proposed formulation of stable holomorphic vector bundles
v on elliptically bered calabiyau n-fold zn in terms of toric geometry to
describe stability conditions on v . using the toric map f : wn+1  (v, zn)
that identies dual pairs of f-theory/heterotic duality we show how stability
can be related to the existence of holomorphic sections of a certain line bundle
that is part of the toric construction.

the heterotic string compactied on calabiyau n fold zn gives rise to interesting
minimal supersymmetric string vacua with a quite realistic spectrum of gauge symmetries
and matter elds [1]. the denition of these vacua, involves the specication of a gauge
background v with structure group h  g0 embedded in the perturbative heterotic gauge
group g0 = e8  e8 or so(32) such that

c1(v ) = 0 mod 2,

(v ) = c2(z) + [w ],

(1)

where  is the four-dimensional characteristic class of v . the second term [w ] applies
to a generalization of heterotic vacua which include non-perturbative ve-branes [2]. here
[w ] is a sum of formal four-forms that integrate to one in the transverse direction to
the ve-branes. note that the ve-branes necessarily have to wrap two-cycles in a 3-fold

compactication; such cycles have to be holomorphic in order to preserve supersymmetry
[3].

in addition, the connection on v has to satisfy

fab = fab = 0,

gabf ab = 0.

(2)

the rst equation says that v is holomorphic, while the second equation is interpreted
as some stability condition on v . although an existence theorem exists under certain
conditions [4], explicit solutions to (2) have been known only in very special constructions.

the diculty to nd appropriate backgrounds v has hampered the study of interesting
four-dimensional vacua for a long time.

an entirely independent construction of holomorphic, stable vector bundles3 v on
calabiyau n-folds zn has been developed in [6] using a certain limit of type iia strings
compactied on a calabiyau n + 1 fold wn+1.
in this paper we will obtain a simple
stability criterion for v from the geometrical type ii setup. the relation of type iia
strings and holomorphic stable vector bundles can be traced back to a simple extension of
mirror symmetry in a k3  t 2 compactication [7], more specically a discrete symmetry
in the moduli space of this compactication that relates geometric deformations of k3 to
wilson lines on the t 2 factor. in other words, the physics of wilson lines on z1 = t 2, is the
same as the physics of a type iia string compactied on a certain limit w2 of an elliptically
k3 manifold w2. the relevant type iia compactication geometry w2 in this limit is the

3 we will loosely call v a bundle in the following, though our construction naturally yields sheaf
generalizations of bundles, which provide the relevant set up for heterotic string compactications

[5].

local mirror of a kahler resolution of an h singularity of an elliptically bered ale space.

here h is the structure group of the bundle v , as before. fibering this picture, using the

adiabatic argument of [8], one obtains an equivalence between a type iia compactication
on (the geometric limit wn+1 of) an elliptic and k3 bered calabiyau manifold wn+1
and holomorphic stable vector bundles on an elliptically bered manifold zn. holomorphic
stable bundles v on smooth elliptic brations zn have been rst considered in [9] and
subsequently in [10].

the construction in [6] has been formulated in terms of toric geometry which for many
purposes is the most useful and most general denition for the calabiyau manifolds wn+1
and zn. the toric construction of the pair (v, zn) in terms of an n + 1 dimensional non-
compact calabiyau manifold wn+1 works for any structure group h of the bundle. if
h ts into the perturbative heterotic gauge group g0 = e8  e8 or so(32), we can
interpret (v, zn) as a valid perturbative heterotic vacuum. precisely in this case one can
nd an embedding of the geometry wn+1 into a compact calabiyau manifold wn+1.
the statement that type iia string compactied on a limit of wn+1 is equivalent to the
heterotic string compactication on (v, zn) then establishes f-theory/heterotic duality
[11][12] in the classical limit.

wn+1 , which is the convex hull of a set of integral vertices 

toric geometry describes a calabiyau n-fold zn in terms of a convex, toric polyhe-
dron 
i in a standard integral
lattice n 4. it is satisfying to observe how the heterotic physics such as the compactication
manifold zn and some dening data of the bundle v have a very simple representation in
terms of the polyhedron 
. moreover also non-perturbative dynamics of the heterotic
vacuum for singular congurations, in particular non-perturbative gauge symmetries and
non-perturbative ve-branes that appear in (1), can be read of from the toric data of wn+1
in a simple way. it is the purpose of this note to extend the dictionary between physical

wn+1

and toric data developed in [6] to describe stability of the bundle v in terms of convexity
of the polyhedron 

.

wn+1

in particular it was noted in [6], that for a given structure group h of the bundle,
convexity of the toric polyhedron 
w3 translates to a bound on the rst chern class  =
c1(n ) of a line bundle n that is an important characteristic of the bundle v . observing
that in six dimensions, the bound on  from convexity of  translates to the stability
of instantons on k3 with structure group h, these bounds were interpreted as a similar

stability condition in lower dimensions. a general formula for the stability of v in terms of

4 see [6] for a list of reviews on toric geometry in the physics literature.

bounds on  was subsequently conjectured in ref. [13] which was however not in agreement5
with the original bounds in [6]. in the following we derive a general stability bound for 
from the toric representation of data (v, zn) which is consistent and, we believe, gives a
correct treatment.

we start with a sketch of the toric description of the pair (v, zn) in terms of the
non-compact calabiyau n + 1-fold wn+1. the latter is elliptically bered with base bn
and ale bered with base bn1. the manifold wn+1 is dened as the vanishing locus of
a polynomial p in a toric ambient space with coordinates (y, x, z, v, xi), where xi denote
the coordinates of the base bn1 and (y, x, z, v) are certain coordinates on the ale ber.
the general form of p is

p = p0 + p+ = p0(y, x, z; xi) +

j

x

j=1

vjpj

+(y, x, z; xi) ,

(3)

+ are quasi-homogeneous polynomials.

where p0 and pj
in particular the v independent
piece p0 describes an elliptically bered calabiyau manifold zn : p0 = 0, while the
polynomials pj
+ contain the information about the bundle v . more specically, each node
in the ane dynkin diagram (h) with dynkin index si contributes one monomial to the
polynomial psi
in the case h = su (n ), we have n
nodes of index 1, each of which contributes a monomial to p1
+. the precise form of the v
dependent part of p is p+ = v(an (xi)zn + an 2(xi)zn 2x + . . . + a0(xi)xn/2) for n even
with the last term being  yx(n 3)/2 for n odd. the complex parameters multiplying
the monomials in p+ give a projective parametrization of the moduli space of the su (n )
bundle.

+ ; in particular j = max(si). e.g.

thus the structure group h determines the y, x, z, v content of the monomials ap-
pearing in the dening equation p of wn+1.
it does not determine the dependence on
the base variables xi, however. this dependence species part the topological class of v
that enter the higher chern classes c2(v ), c3(v ), . . .. however note that this dependence
is quite restricted because of the quasi-homogeneousness of p. it was shown in [6] that
the dependence of the monomials in p on xi is completely determined by specifying the
action of two c  actions acting on (y, x, z, v, xi). in other words, we have to specify two
line bundles l and m on the base bn1 and the coordinates (y, x, z, v, xi) transform as
certain sections of m and l such that

y  m3l3,

x  m2l2,

z  m,

v  m5n ,

fc,d  mdlc,

(4)

5 the discriminant criterion used in [13] is not restrictive enough to x the structure group h.

3

where fc,d = fc,d(xi) is the base dependent part in a monomial

y(62bc)/3xb zcvdfc,d(xi)

of p. moreover n is the highest power of z that appears in p1
+.

from the fact that p0 = 0 describes a calabiyau manifold it follows that the bundle
l is actually the anti-canonical bundle of bn1. on the other hand m is an intrinsic
property of v alone. in the following we will derive a bound on the rst chern class c1(n )
of the line bundle n = ml6 from convexity of the polyhedron 
. the change from
wn+1
m to n is intended to make contact with the notation of ref.
[9], where v has been
described in terms of sections of a certain weighted projective bundle w on bn1 with
coordinates on w being sections of n sildj . here si are the dynkin indices as above and
di are the degrees of the independent casimir invariants of h. the dependence of higher
chern classes of v on c1(n ) has been determined in [9][14].

to keep the discussion as basic as possible we will work directly with the dening poly-
nomial p rather than with the toric polyhedron 
wn+1 that determines p [15]. in particular,
if we consider a structure group h  g0, we have a compact embedding wn+1  wn+1.
moreover the k3 ber (that, in a local patch, contains the ale ber of wn+1) has a
singularity g which is the commutant of h in g0 [12]. the dening polynomial p of wn+1
can be written in generalized weierstrass form:

p = y2 + x3 + yxza1 + x2 z2a2 + y z3a3 + xz4a4 + z6a6 .

(5)

note that we use (y, x, z) and (y, x, z) to denote the homogeneous coordinates of the elliptic
ber of the n + 1-dimensional calabiyau wn+1 and the n dimensional calabiyau zn,
respectively. the an are functions of the coordinates xi of the base bn of the elliptic
bration of wn+1.
in particular having a singularity of type g above a locus, say at
z  x1 = 0 on the base bn can be phrased in terms of the behavior of the an near z = 0,
an  zn using tates algorithm [16].

to reiterate, the structure group h determines the singularity g of the k3 ber of
wn+1.
in turn g is determined by the behavior of the coecient functions an in the
generalized weierstrass form p near the singularity z = 0. moreover we are interested in
the singularity of the k3 ber w2 of the k3 bration w2  wn+1  bn1. thus z is now
a coordinate on the base p1 of the elliptically berered k3,  : w2  p1. however note
that in the local limit wn+1  wn+1 where our map f : wn+1  (v, zn) applies, the an

4

become nothing but the bn dependent parts of the monomials y(6bc)/3xb zcvdfc,d(xi) in
the dening polynomial p of wn+1.

to be more explicit let us consider the case g0 = e8  e8. the relation between the
coordinates in p and p, using z  x1, w  x2 as the coordinates of the base p1 of w2 as
above, is then

(y, x, z; v; xi)p = (y, x, zzw; w/z; xi, i > 3) p.

in particular the existence of a term an = zn f (xi) implies that the line bundle

n dnln6dn

(6)

has a holomophic section, where we have dened dn = n  n. combining the conditions
imposed by all the an, n  {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} we arrive at the condition

(g) c1(l)   ( 12c1(l) ),

where (g) is the singularity dependent quantity

(g) = max(

(6dn  n)

dn

) ,

(7)

(8)

for all n  {1, 2, 3, 4, 6} with dn 6= 0. note that this argument also tells us that the minimal
bundle nmin is always a power of l, a fact that is non-trivial for h1,1(b) > 1. we have
also indicated in (7) an upper bound for  of a very dierent origin. it is not related to the
stability of n but rather to the stability of  = c1(n )  0, where n  is the equivalent
bundle in the second e8 factor.

from eqs. (7),(8) we obtain

g = su (2) :
g = su (3) :
g = su (m ) :
g = so(n ) :

g = e6 :
g = g2 :
g = f4 :

(9)

here n  {7, . . . , 12}, m  {2, . . . , 6} and the groups with a star denote the singularities
associated to iii and iv s bers in the list of [16]. moreover l = c1(l). note that our
arguments for the bound (7) give a necessary but in general not sucient criterion for
the stability of the bundle. in particular the distinction between singularities associated
to simply laced (sl) and non-simply laced (nsl) groups is often the specic form of the

5

sections fc,d in the sl case rather than a dierence in the topological class [16]. our
arguments give a criterion for the existence of a holomorphic section fc,d which is sucient
for sl groups, but it does not ensure that one gets a generic enough section to describe
also the nsl case. thus the bounds given in (9) are strict lower bounds only for the simply
laced case.

it would be nice to have a derivation of the bound on  that is directly related to the
structure group h and in particular also applies to the non-compact case with arbitrary

rank. a reasonable proposal based on (9) is

h = su (n ) :
h = so(7) :
h = so(m ) :
h = sp(k) :

  n  l
  4  l
  m
2  l
  2k  l

h = e8 :
h = e7 :
h = e6 :
h = g2 :
h = f4 :

where n  2, m  8 and k  2. here we have used the calculation of the six-dimensional
spectrum in table 3 of [16] to raise the bounds for the nsl cases, such that we get the
correct answer in six dimensions. similarly we could compare the calculation of the matter

spectrum in four dimension for a heterotic compactication on a calabiyau 3-fold with
(9).

it is interesting to observe, how the geometric type iia description contains non-trivial
information about the instanton dynamics on calabiyau manifolds zn. moreover in many
cases there is also another point of view, namely in terms of a supersymmetric eld theory
in uncompactied space time. in particular, via the heterotic compactication on k3t 2,
the instanton dynamics on k3 is related to the moduli space of n = 2 supersymmetric
eld theories. similarly, instantons on calabiyau three-folds will be related to the moduli
space of n = 1 super-yang-mills theories. it would be very interesting to use the toric
type iia construction of v on zn to study this relation in detail.
