abstract

we nd a universal so(2) symmetry of a p-form maxwell theory for both odd and
even p. for odd p it corresponds to the duality rotations but for even p it denes a
new set of transformations which is not related to duality rotations. in both cases a
symmetry group denes a subgroup of the o(2, 1) group of r-linear canonical transfor-
mations which has also a natural representation on the level of quantization condition
for p-brane dyons.

introduction

the old idea of electric-magnetic duality plays in recent years very prominent role (see e.g.
[1]). in the present letter we investigate this idea in the context of a maxwell p-form theory
in d = 2p + 2 dimensional minkowski space-time m2p+2 (we choose a signature of the
minkowski metric (, +, ..., +)). the motivation to study such type of theories comes e.g.
from a string theory where one considers higher dimensional objects (so called p-branes)
interacting with a gauge eld.

let a denote a p-form potential and f = da be a corresponding (p + 1)-form eld

strength. then the generalized maxwell equations are given by:

d  f = 0 ,

where  denotes a hodge operation in m2p+2. this operation satises

  = (1)p ,

(1)

(2)

which implies a fundamental dierence between duality transformations dened for dierent
parities of p. introducing a complex eld

x := f + i  f

the duality rotations have the following form:

x  ei x ,
x  cosh  x + i sinh  x,

for p odd ,
for p even ,

(3)

(4)
(5)

with x denoting a complex conjugation of x. note, that there is an essential dierence
between analytical properties of so(2) rotations (4) and hyperbolic so(1, 1) rotations (5).

namely, the former are c-linear whereas the latter are only r-linear. this mathematical
dierence has even stronger physical consequences. it is well known that maxwell p-form
electrodynamics is duality invariant only for odd p [2], [3], i.e. only (4) denes a symmetry
of a theory.

in the present letter we show that there is a universal so(2) symmetry of a p-form
maxwell theory which is valid for any p. when p is odd this symmetry is equivalent to (4)
but when p is even it does not correspond to the duality rotation (5).

in order to nd this new symmetry we look more closely into the hamiltonian structure of
a p-form theory. decomposing m2p+2 into a time-line and a (2p + 1) dimensional space-like
hyperplane  the maxwell equations (1) supplemented by the bianchi identity df = 0 have
the following form:

e = db ,

b = (1)p de ,

together with the gauss constraints

de = 0 ,

db = 0 ,

(6)

(7)

where e and b are electric and magnetic p-forms on  dened in the standard way via f
(see e.g.
[2]). the dual (p + 1)-forms e = e and b = b are dened via the hodge star
 on  induced form m2p+2 (we shall use the same symbol for both operations). note the
presence of a p-dependent sign in (6) which plays a crucial role in what follows.

now, our strategy looks as follows: in the next section we dene new variables qs and
s which are more convenient for our purpose. we call them reduced variables because they
already solve the gauss constraints (7). in section 3. we reformulate the canonical structure
of a p-form theory in terms of the reduced variables. it allows us to make an observation
that theories with dierent parities of p are related by a simple transformation of variables.
it turns out that the canonical structure possesses a natural o(2, 1) invariance group. for
odd p there is a so(2) subgroup of o(2, 1) corresponding to duality rotations (4). however,
for even p no such a subgroup corresponding to so(1, 1) rotations (5) exists. nevertheless,
also in this case, there is a so(2) subgroup dening a symmetry of a maxwell theory. this
subgroup is a true counterpart of (4) for a theory with p even. finally, we show that there
is a natural realization of the above o(2, 1) symmetry on a level of the generalized dirac
quantization condition for p-brane dyons [6].

2. reduced variables

let us choose spherical coordinates on  centered at some arbitrary point and let s2p(r)
denote a 2p dimensional sphere of radius r. using the canonical embedding

r

: s2p(r)  

let us dene the following (p  1)-forms on each s2p(r):

q1
q2

:= 
:= 

r (r | e) ,
r (r | b) ,

and

2

p1 d  

:= r1
:= r1

r b ,
r e,

p1 d

(8)

(9)
(10)

(11)

(12)

where 
 are operations on s2p(r) induced from  via r. note, that 
therefore, s are well dened.

p1 denotes a laplacian on (p  1)-forms on s2p(1). in the above formulae d and
p1 is invertible (cf. [4]),

the crucial property of the above dened variables consists in the following

theorem 1 the quantities (q, );  = 1, 2 contain the entire gauge-invariant informa-
tion about the elds e and b. moreover, they already solve gauss constraints (7).

for proof see [4]. note, that s are highly nonlocal functions of e and b. however, it
was observed long ago [5] that in ordinary (p = 1) electrodynamics duality rotations (4) are
generated by a nonlocal operator. therefore, as we show, qs and s are well suited to
study the duality invariance of a p-form theory. more detailed analysis of these variables
may be found in [4].

3. canonical structure

having any two k-forms  and  on s2p(r) let us dene a standard scalar product:

(, )r := zs 2p(r)

   .

moreover, let

(, ) := z 

0

dr (, )r .

with this notation one has

theorem 2 the phase space of a p-form theory is endowed with the canonical symplectic
structure p given by:

p = (1, q1) + (1)p+1(2, q2) .

for proof see [4]. now, let us dene complex forms:

q := q1 + iq2 ,
 := 1 + i2 .

denoting by  (+) a symplectic form p for odd (even) p one has:

 = re (, q) ,
+ = re (, q) ,

(13)

(14)
(15)

(16)
(17)

where re stands for a real part. finally, maxwell equations rewritten in terms of reduced
variables read (cf. [4]):

q = 
 = 1

p1  ,
p1 hr12

r (rq) + r2

for odd p, and

q = 
 = 1

p1  ,
p1 hr12

r (rq) + r2

p1 qi ,

p1 qi ,

(18)

(19)

for even p. one easily shows that (18) and (19) dene hamiltonian equations with respect
to  and + respectively generated by the following hamiltonian:

hp =

1

2(p  1)! h(cid:16)r1q, r1q(cid:17)  (cid:16)r1r(rq), 1

p1r1r(rq)(cid:17)  (cid:16), 

p1(cid:17)i .(20)

moreover, one may easily prove

lemma 1 numerically hp equals to the standard maxwell hamiltonian obtained via the
symmetric energy-momentum tensor

hp =

1

2p! z

(e  e + b  b) .

note, that the dierence between theories with dierent parities of p is now very transparent.
namely, they are related by a simple replacement   . this way one obtains (17) from
(16) and (19) from (18). note, that the hamiltonian (20) is invariant under   .

4. canonical transformations and duality rotations

now, let us look for the canonical transformation with respect to  and +. in the class
of r-linear transformations we have

lemma 2 the following generators:

g1 = im (q, ) , g2 = im (q, ) , g3 = re (q, ) , g4 = re (q, ) ,

generates both with respect to  and + the o(2, 1) group of r-linear canonical transfor-
mations.

note, that the set (g1, g2, g3, g4) is closed with respect to   . moreover, there is o(2)
subgroup of c-linear transformations generated by (g1, g3) and (g2, g4) for odd and even
p respectively (actually, g3 and g4 generate the corresponding centers of o(2, 1)).

now, it is easy to prove the following

theorem 3 the maxwell hamiltonian (20) is invariant under the action of g1 and g2 for
odd and even p respectively.

let us observe that the duality rotations (4) and (5) may be expressed as follows:

q  ei q ,
  ei  ,

for p odd, and

q  cosh  q  i sinh  q ,
  cosh   + i sinh   ,

(21)

(22)

for even p. one immediately sees that (21) are generated by g1 but none of gk does corre-
spond to (22). this fact that the hyperbolic so(1, 1) rotations are not even implementable
as canonical transformations was observed in a slightly dierent context in [3].

4

therefore, the true counterpart of (21) for p even is not (22) (it is obvious because they

are not related via   ) but

q  ei q ,
  ei  ,

which is generated by g2 via +.

(23)

finally, let us note that quantum mechanics applied to a p-form theory implies the

following quantization condition for p-brane dyons [6]:

e1g2 + (1)pe2g1 = nh ,

(24)

with an integer n (h denotes the planck constant). for odd p the above condition is a
generalization of the famous dirac condition [7] but for even p it was observed only recently
[6]. again, a parity of p plays a crucial role in (24). introducing a complex charge

q := e + ig

the formula (24) may be rewritten as follows:

im (q1q2) = nh ,
im (q1q2) = nh ,

p odd ,
p even .

(25)
(26)

let us observe that there is a direct correspondence between formulae (16) and (25) and
formulae (17) and (26). therefore, making the following replacements:   q1 and q  q2
we obtain the natural action of o(2, 1) on the level of charges.
