(2) (3) complex linear supereld also called non-minimal chiral supereld, dening equation closely related chiral supereld (1); retrospect, ought called minimal chiral. purposes short note, adopt shorter, chiral linear names, moreover use complex elds. simple lagrangian densities =z d4 , l(0) l(0) = z d4 , (4) rewritten terms component elds 11 correspondence elimina- tion auxiliary component elds . even current literature, fact misinterpreted proof chiral linear superelds physically equivalent. herein, dispell related delusions oering two simple proofs, rely denition superelds, focus two distinct aspects inequivalence them. proofs encompass, mutatis mutandis, minimal non-minimal haploid superelds ref. . 1. 1st proof: correlation functions rather well exploited fact chiral superelds form ring. fact, analytic function collection chiral superelds also chiral supereld. this, rather obviously, case linear superelds: nonlinear function even single linear supereld linear, i.e., obeys eqs. (2). is, set linear superelds closed multiplication: product 12 obey eq. (2). simple mathematical fact extraordinary consequence comparing two models using chiral vs. linear superelds. supersymmetric correlation functions chiral superelds always independent (spacetime) position superelds : xm 1 h|12|i =d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16) 1 1 (cid:17)2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e | {z }0 h| q xm 1 h|(cid:8)q , (cid:9)2|i , (5) 2 + 2 q |i 0 , | {z }0 |i supersymmetric vacuum, annihilated supercharges, used dening equations (1). thus, models involving chiral superelds always topological (more properly, rigid) sector among correlation functions. stark contrast consequence diering denition only, rigidity obtains supersymmetric correlation functions products linear superelds: models built linear superelds place chiral ones topological sector. correlation functions determine (quantum) model, follows models linear superelds fundamentally inequivalent models chiral superelds. 2. 2nd proof: gauge interactions, 2 dimensions recall eqs. (1) (2) hold also 2-dimensions, lorentz group becoming sl(2, c) so(1, 1) u (1), drop over-dots spinorial indices. consider coupling superelds gauge symmetry. shown ref. , 2- dimensional supersymmetric theories admit twisted version usual gauge vector multiplet covariant (super)derivatives satisfy ( = 1, 2): {, } = 4ig3 p , {, } = 2i , (6) p lie algebra valued supereld superderivatives provide twisted versions usual fermionic bosonic eld strengths auxiliary eld: presence gauge symmetry, denitions (1) (2) need modied  = fw ,  = (cid:0)ef + ied(cid:1) . (7)  = 0 ,  = 0 , 2  = 0 ,  = 0 . (8) (9) note that, dened above, p automatically satises latter eqs. (8); conjugate, p chiral, whence call {p,fw, ef ,ed} chiral vector multiplet. dimen- sionally reduced standard gauge multiplet likewise determined twisted chiral supereld , , call {, w, f, d} twisted gauge vector multiplet. integrability condition one derive chiral superelds , anticommuting  (8)with , antisymmetrizing: implies covariantly chiral superelds (8) must chargeless respect 0 =(cid:8), (cid:9) +(cid:8), (cid:9) =(cid:2){, }, (cid:3) def= 4ig3 gauge group generated chiral gauge vector multiplet {p,fw, ef ,ed}. again, consequence diering denition only, restriction obtains  . (10) covariantly linear supereld (9). mirror argument proves superelds covariantly twisted- chiral respect twisted gauge multiplet must also chargeless respect gauge symmetry. 2 sum up, covariantly chiral superelds couple twisted chiral gauge multiplet (6), covariantly twisted-chiral superelds couple chiral twisted vector multiplet. stark contrast, linear superelds mirror- twisted brethren couple indiscriminately chiral twisted gauge multiplets, cannot possibly equivalent discriminately coupling (twisted-)chiral ilk. 3. old proof opens new possibilities unassuming remark ref. , p. 200, states: possible introduce arbitrary mass nonderivative self-interaction terms linear complex supereld. clear fact denition chiral supereld (1) ensures general lagrangian density takes form: l =z d4 k(, ) +z d2 w () + h.c. , (11) whereas denition linear supereld (2) restricts general lagrangian to: l =z d4 f (, ) + h.c. (12) besides sophisticated consequences renormalization 1), important dierence be- tween (11) (12) based dimensional grounds only: restricted renor- malizable, 4 dimensions, l admits mass parameter must quadratic! proves renormalizable models (only) linear superelds cannot describe massive elds yukawa interactions, whereas renormalizable models chiral super- elds can. two cannot possibly equivalenteven free eld limit! brings interesting possibility. recall eective low-energy (su- per)eld limit superstring theories  identied based physical (propagat- ing) degrees freedom. logically possible limit fact ought involve linear instead chiral superelds. so, matter elds descending superstrings would massless gauge interactions. precisely needed models discussed ref. , using chiral superelds end thwarted mainly yukawa intereactions. note also combined use chiral linear superelds enables description phenomena describable use either one superelds alone {$9810137$}. indeed, owing self-interaction, linear superelds well adapted describe atness (co)tangent spaces. unlike richness 2-dimensional (super)spacetime, made possible joint use chiral twisted-chiral superelds ref. , far greater richness made possible use many types superelds . acknowledgments: many thanks s.j. gates, jr. helpful discussions, generous support department energy grant de-fg02-94er-40854, also institute theoretical physics santa barbara, part work done support national science foundation, grant no. phy94-07194. 1) r d4-terms notoriously undergo renormalization, generally complicated fashion, whereas r d2-terms typically not: see p. 358 ref. . 3 references  j. wess j. bagger: supersymmetry supergravity (princeton university pub., princeton nj, 1983).  s.j. gates, jr., m.t. grisaru, m. rocek w. siegel: superspace (benjamin/cummings pub. co., reading, massachusetts, 1983).  p. west: introduction supersymmetry supergravity (world scientic, singapore, 2nd ext, ed.: 1990).  h. muller-kirsten a. wiedmann: supersymmetry: introduction conceptual calculational details (world scientic, singapore, 1987).  i.l. buchbinder s.m. kuzenko: ideas methods supersymmetry supergravity : walk superspace, (iop, bristol, 1998).  s.j. gates, jr. w. siegel: nucl. phys. b187 (1981)389.  s.j. gates, jr. b.b. deo: nucl. phys. b254 (1985)187-200.  t. hubsch: haploid (2,2)-superelds 2-dimensional spacetime. hep-th/9901038.  d. amati, k. konishi, y. meurice, g.c. rossi g. veneziano: phys. rep. 162c (1988)170,
