abstract

we consider general properties of central charges of zero-branes and associated
duality invariants, in view of their double role, on the bulk and on the world volume
(quantum mechanical) theory.

a detailed study of the bps condition for the mass spectrum arising from
toroidal compactications is given for 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 bps states in any dimen-
sion. as a byproduct, we retrieve the u-duality invariant conditions on the charge
(zero mode) spectrum and the orbit classication of bps states preserving dierent
fractions of supersymmetry.

the bps condition for 0-branes in theories with 16 supersymmetries in any

dimension is also discussed.

1 introduction.

in recent time, the role of duality symmetries of a dynamical theory encompassing quan-
tum gravity has received increasing attention in several contexts.

particular examples where the duality takes an important role, especially in connection
with non perturbative properties, is the ads/cft correspondence [1], related to the
horizon geometry of p-branes and their world-volume conformal eld theory description.
another example is the connection between m-theory compactied on a torus td

d
[2, 5, 6, 3, 4] and (d + 1) yang-mills theory compactied on the dual torus t

.

more closely related to the latter is the recent investigation of d-brane born-infeld
actions and the role played by duality in explaining several properties of their hamiltonian
formulation and the corresponding energy spectrum of bps states [7]. in this framework it
is believed that born-infeld non abelian gauge theories with non trivial r-r backgrounds,
are naturally described by some generalization of gauge theories on non commutative tori
[8].

the framework of non commutative geometry oers for instance, a new interpretation
of the t-duality group o(d, d; z) of quantum mechanical systems obtained by compacti-
fying the born-infeld action of d-branes on td. the latter occurs in type ii string theory
compactied on td [9, 10, 11, 12].

these quantum mechanical systems have also been shown [13], at least for d  4, to
exhibit the full extended u-duality symmetry1 ed+1(d+1), rather than the smaller symme-
try ed(d) present in matrix gauge theory on td, where it appears as an extension of the
geometrical symmetry sl(d) [4, 6].

in previous investigations, the central charge matrix z for 0-branes played a role,
not only as central extension of supersymmetry algebra in theories with non trivial 0-
brane background metric, but also as eective potential of the geodesic action of a one-
dimensional lagrangian system derived from the bulk einstein-maxwell lagrangian, in
presence of moduli elds {} and quantized charges qa of zero-branes [14, 15].
entropy formula as the extremization of the weinhold potential [15].

the critical points of this potential were seen to determine the bekenstein-hawking

w =

tr(zz )

(1.1)

or equivalently of the bps mass mbp s = |zh| where |zh| is the highest eigenvalue of
zz  [17].
in the world-volume description of 0-branes, the very same function w appears as

hamiltonian of the 0-brane quantum mechanics [7, 13, 16]

h(q) = s 1

tr(zz (, q)),

(1.2)

where the quantized charges are replaced by a set of hamiltonian variables q, which belong
to the same duality multiplet as the quantized charges of the bulk supergravity theory in
presence of zero-brane sources.

1in this paper u-duality will mean both the classical and quantum u-duality

1

the appearence of the central charge in the 0-brane action in arbitrary d = 4 super-
gravity backgrounds has recently been shown to occur as a consequence of -supersymmetry
[18].

in this framework the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian (1.2) is given by the bps

mass formula of the eective supergravity theory [7]
mbp s = |zh(, q0)|,

(1.3)

where the hamiltonian variables q are replaced by their zero mode part q0 which eventually
coincide with the same duality multiplet of the quantized charges of the bulk theory, but
now with the interpretation of uxes and momenta of the world-volume hamiltonian
description [4, 6].

these zero modes ll representations of the u-duality group ed+1(d+1)(z) for systems
with maximal supersymmetry and the bps spectrum preserves some fraction of super-
symmetry depending on the particular orbit of the charge vector state [19, 20, 21].

note that the bps energy |zh(, q0)| is not the same as replacing in qzz (, q) the

zero mode q0 of q, unless the states are 1/2 bps [7], which, as we will see, can only occur
if the charge duality multiplet satises some duality invariant conditions. at the classical
level, where the charges are continuous , this is equivalent to say that the zero-mode part
belongs to a particular orbit of the charge vector representation of the duality group g.
it is the aim of the present investigation to derive general formulas of the energy
spectrum for any torus td, d = 1, . . . 6 and provide a new derivation of the dierent bps
conditions in terms of the u-duality invariant constraints, retrieving then the analysis of
maldacena and one of the authors [19] as well as the classication of gunaydin and one
of the authors [20] and lu, pope and stelle [21]. we deal also with the case of 0-branes
in theories in any dimension with 16 supersymmetries. this is interesting because it is
related to heterotic strings compactied on td or type ii theories compactied on more
general manifolds (such as k3).

the paper is organized as follows:
in section 3 we consider systems compactied on td, d = 1, . . . 4 where only 1/2 and

1/4 bps states occur.

in section 4 we consider the richer structure occurring for d=5,6 where a complete

understanding of the world volume theory is still missing.

in section 5 the bps conditions are derived for the case of theories with sixteen

supersymmetries in any dimension.

2 central charges and geometrical tools of coset spaces.

in the present section we review the central charges for 0-branes in theories with maximal
supersymmetry and the bps conditions on the u-multiplet of quantized charges which
entail dierent orbits of the duality group which preserve dierent fractions of supersym-
metry. the analysis for theories with 16 supersymmetries will be considered in the last
section.

the supergravity theories describing these systems can be obtained in three dierent
ways, by compactifying m theory on td+1 ((d + 1)-dimensional torus) or type iia and
type iib string theories on td. we will consider here supergravity theories compactied
down up to d = 4 space-time dimensions (d = 1, . . . 6).

2

some of the results presented here overlap with previous analysis for d = 1, . . . 4, when
only 1/2 or 1/4 bps states are present [5, 7, 16]. the analysis of d = 5, 6 is essentially
novel although the bps conditions for 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 bps states were previously
discussed in the literature and the orbit classications derived [19, 20, 21].

2.1 r-symmetry and u-duality.
the supersymmetry algebra of type ii string theory compactied on td down to 10  d
dimensions has an r-symmetry group and a continuous duality group which depends on
d. the r-symmetry is given below [22]:

r-symmetry group h

d = 1 u(1)
d = 2 su(2)  u(1)
d = 3 usp(4)  o(5)
d = 4 usp(4)  usp(4)  o(5)  o(5)
d = 5 usp(8)
d = 6 su(8)

(2.4)

the u-duality groups g are ed+1(d+1) [22], and the r-symmetry groups are their maximal
compact subgroups. the quantum u-duality groups are ed+1(d+1)(z) [23]. because of the
connection between m-theory and string theory, the groups ed+1(d+1) contain, both

which is the classical isometry group of the moduli space of a td+1 torus in m-theory and

gl(d + 1)  ed+1(d+1)

(2.5)

o(1, 1)  o(d, d)  ed+1(d+1)

(d 6= 6),

sl(2)  o(6, 6)  e7(7)

for d = 6,

(2.6)

which is the s-t duality group of string theory [24, 25, 23].

in string theory the o(d, d) group combines the geometric isometry of the td torus
gl(d) with the shift of the antisymmetric tensor bij 7 bij + nij while the o(1,1) factor
corresponds to the dilaton shift. the group ed+1(d+1) emerges from the combination of
sl(d + 1) with o(d, d) and this operation gives rise to non perturbative symmetries which
combine the n-s-ns and r-r elds in supermultiplets.

the spinorial charges of the supersymmetry algebra transform in representations of
the r-symmetry group and this implies that the central charges of interest to us have
certain symmetry and reality properties.

in the case of lorentz scalar central charges, appropriate to 0-branes, the classication
goes as follows: the central charge matrix z(, q) is in the same representation of the r-
symmetry as the vector elds a of the corresponding theory. this gives the following
result,

(2.7)

the previous results follow both, from a dynamical reduction of the 11 or 10 dimen-
sional supergravities with 32 supercharges or by an analysis of extended superalgebras in
the appropriate dimensions [26, 27].

since in the original iia theory there is only one d 0-brane (one scalar central charge)
[26], all the charges in lower dimensions come by wrapping branes on the torus cycles,
in the type iib on td, 0-branes emerge as
other than momenta and string windings.
momenta, string windings, and d-branes wrapped on the torus cycles.

if we want to discuss quantum mechanical systems emerging from d + 1 born-infeld
lagrangians compactied on td, we must consider iia d-branes compactied on even
dimensional tori and iib d-branes compactied on odd dimensional tori.

the world volume description of the central charges z and quantized charges q is
fairly well understood for the case of td with d = 1, . . . 4. the u-duality multiplets of
the quantized charges q correspond to uxes, momenta, instanton number and rank of
the gauge groups in the world volume yang-mills theory. the moduli dependent central
charge determines the hamiltonian of the quantum mechanical system as well as the energy
spectrum of the bps states [7, 6].

the main role played by duality is that the central charge vector extends the repre-
sentation of the r-symmetry group to a representation of the full duality group ed+1(d+1)
acting on the vector eld strength. the relevant extensions are as follows [22]

0-brane representation of u-duality group

10 of e4=sl(5)
16 of e5=o(5,5)
27 of e6(6)
56 of e7(7)

(2.8)

the moduli space of these theories is g/h. at the string level this space can be
modded out further by ed+1(z) [23, 24] something similar to the fundamental domain
versus the half plane for the prototype sl(2, r)/o(2).

in table(2.1) we present the u-duality multiplets for 0-branes in the bulk and world

volume description [7].

the gauge elds of type ii supergravity theory, as well as the yang-mills world-volume
uxes complete u-duality multiplets of ed+1(d+1) for d = 1, . . . 4. these multiplets are

4

obtained by the ed(d) ux and momenta multiplets of matrix gauge theory on td and by
adding an ed(d) singlet, the rank of the gauge group. for d = 5, 6, the yang-mills theory
side misses some states corresponding to a ns ve brane and k-k monopoles [4, 6].

the coset spaces g/h (g  u, h  r, in our case) can be described by choosing a
representative in each equivalence class. if  denotes the coordinates of a point in g/h,
then the coset representative will be given by an element l()  g, in the equivalence
class correspondig to , that is, l() is a local section in the principal bundle g over
g/h with structure group h . under the action of g  g on g/h we have  7 g and
the coset representative l() will be mapped to gl() which is on the ber over g, so
necessarily l(g) = gl()h(). taking a representation of the group g, (which is also a
representation of h) we obtain l() as a matrix l
a () where the indexes a and  run in
principle over the same representation space, the dierent names being used to remind the
covariant properties of l. if the representation of g is reducible under h, one can project
down a the subspace where the representation of h is irreducible, so the index a will be
understood as running on that subspace. we will use the representations appropriated to
0-brane multiplets.

the central charge is given by

q is a vector transforming under the contravariant representation of g,

za(, q) = (qt l)a = (qt )l

a ()

qg = (g1)t q

(2.9)

(2.10)

so the central charge is u-duality covariant in the sense that under a transformation

 7 g,

(qgt ) = (qt )(g1)
,

(2.11)

then z 7 zh.
invariant in the sense that

it then follows that any h-invariant function i(z) is also u-duality

i(g, qg) = i(, q),

or

i(zh) = i(z)

(2.12)

5

among the duality invariant combinations there are some which are topological,i.
e., they do not depend on the moduli [28, 30]. this happens when the h-invariant is also
g-invariant with respect to the right action of g. in fact, since z = qt l, with l  g, it
is obvious that if i(z) is g-invariant for z 7 zg, then
i(zg) = i(z) = i(q)

(2.13)

such objects exist for d = 5, 6 [17, 31], but not for d = 1, . . . 4, with the implication that
a bekenstein-hawking entropy formula for 0-branes exist only in 4 and 5 dimensions [32].
we can make a generalization of this analysis to obtain other moduli invariant condi-

tions. let us consider now a covariant expression,

e(z) = e(, q),

(2.14)

where the index  runs over the space of some representation t of g (and h). the
covariance property means that under a left g transformation

e(zg) = e(z)t (g)


(2.15)

it follows that an equation of the form e(z) = e(, q) = 0 is moduli independent, so
e(q) = 0.

now, assume that the representation t admits an h-invariant norm (which is positive

since h is compact).

an equation like

ke(z)k2 = gee.

ke(z)k2 = 0

(2.16)

(2.17)

is in principle moduli dependent since this expression is not g-invariant. but the con-
straint ke(z)k = 0 implies that e(z) = 0, which is moduli independent so e(q) = 0.
the central charges satisfy some dierential identities that are inherited from the coset
representatives. to see this, let us consider the algebra valued maurer-cartan form in g,
usually expressed for a matrix group as

m c = g(x)1dg(x)

(2.18)

where x denotes coordinates on the group g. the components of the maurer-cartan form
are left invariant forms, and one can take the pullback to g/h by the local section l(),
giving a local, algebra valued left invariant form on g/h

() = l1()dl().

(2.19)

consider now the cartan decomposition of the lie algebra of g as g = h  k, where h is
the lie algebra of h, the maximal compact subgroup of g, and k can be identied with
the tangent space at the identity coset. since our coset spaces are symmetric spaces, the
following properties are satised,

[h, h]  h,

[h, k]  k,

[k, k]  h.

(2.20)

6

the second equation in (2.20) means that by the adjoint, h acts on k as a representation
r of dimension equal to dim(g/h). we can write  according to this decomposition of
the algebra,

 = iti + p t

(2.21)
where {ti} form a basis of h and {t} form a basis of k. the projection of  on h, iti
is a g invariant connection on the bundle with ber k and basis g/h, associated to the
principal bundle g(g/h) by the representation r of h. we call this bundle e(g/h).
the connection is expressed in an open set as

()

 = ic 
i

(2.22)

the other components of , p , provide us with the local expresion of a homomor-
phism between e(g/h) and the tangent bundle t (g/h). by means of this homomor-
phism we can pull back the invariant riemannian connection on g/h which coincides
with . finally, the invariant metric on g/h, induced by the cartan-killing metric on
g can be locally represented as

g = tr(tt)p 

 p 
 .

(2.23)

(the indices (, ) are 1-form indices on g/h).

we want now to write (2.19) using a representation of g (and h) labeled as we

explained above indistinctely by indices of the type  or a, then we have

by dening as usual the covariant derivative with respect to h

dl

a = l

a = dl

a  l

we obtain

hl

a = l

b p b
a.

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

a is block diagonal, the indices of type a in hl

suppose now that the representation of h is reducible and we want to project onto an
irreducible factor. since b
a can be
understood as running on the smaller representation, while p b
a will have in general o
diagonal components, so we could denote it by p b
a , b running on the large representation
space, but still specifying the covariant properties under h. this happens when matter
elds are present. in that case the h group is a direct product hr  hm . hr is the
r-symmetry group and hm is some matter avour symmetry. we assume now (as it will
happen in all our examples) that the representation of g decomposes under h as (1, tm )
+(tr,1), where tm is a representation of hm and tr is a representation of hr. then,
there is a basis where the generic index  splits into (a, i), where a runs over the vector
space representation of tr and i runs over the representation space of tm . then (2.26)
decomposes as

hrl
hm l

a = l
i = l

b p b
a p a

(2.28)

the central charges za = (qt l)a and matter charges zi = (qt l)i satisfy consequently
the identities

hrza = zbp b
hm zi = zap a

i .

(2.29)

in the forthcoming sections we will see that these properties enter in the discussion of

the bps conditions and their duality invariant character.

2.2 orbit classication of bps states.

in order to further study properties of central charges which will be useful in the following
section, we would like to remind the orbit classication of 0-brane bps congurations
[20, 21]. to do so we will state some results of matrix algebra that will be useful for our
analysis. we consider matrices over the real, complex and quaternion elds, m r, m c, m q.
for each of these matrices, the following polar decomposition holds

m r = qm rm r t o
m c = qm cm cu
m q = qm qm q uq

(2.30)
where the matrices mm  are hermitian and o, u and uq are orthogonal, unitary and
quaternionic unitary (unitary symplectic), respectively.

from this decomposition it then follows that if m r is symmetric, m c hermitian and m q
symplectic hermitian, they can be diagonalized by an appropriate transformation which
is respectively orthogonal, unitary and unitary symplectic. instead, for general matrices
we can bring them to a diagonal form in the following way,

md = u1mu 
2

(2.31)

where u1 and u2 belong to o(n), u(n) or usp(n) in each case.

it can also be shown that any antisymmetric matrix can be brought to a skew-diagonal

form (normal form) by a transformation [33]

msd = umu t

(2.32)

where as before, u belongs to the appropriate group. .

since the central charge vector is a 2-tensor representation of h, we can always apply

one of the above results.

from the structure of the r-symmetry group listed above and the representation
properties from (2.7) we will see that it follows that with an r-rotation we can always

8

diagonalize (or skew-diagonalize) the matrix z. for d = 1, . . . 4 there will be only two
eigenvalues, three eigenvalues for for d = 5 and four eigenvalues for d = 6.

the richer structure occurring for d = 5, 6 is the why also 1/8 bps states occur,

instead of the two possibilities of d = 1, . . . 4.

in the following table we list the orbits of the representations in eq.(2.1) corresponding

to the 0-brane bps congurations [20, 21].

e7(7)/e6(2)

e7(7)/(o(5,6)  r32)  r e7(7)/f4(4)  r26,

table 2.2

these orbits correspond, for d = 1, . . . 4 to the possibility of having two coinciding eigen-
values (1/2 bps) or not (1/4 bps) for the central charge matrix. for d = 5, 6, 1/2 bps
correspond to 3 and 4 coinciding eigenvalues respectively, 1/4 bps orbits correspond
to 2 equal eigenvalues and 2 pairs of equal eigenvalues respectively and 1/8 bps orbits
correspond to all dierent eigenvalues. in d = 6 there are there two kinds of 1/8 bps
orbits depending whether the quartic invariant vanishes or not (light-like or time-like
orbit)[19, 20].

in the following section we will see that, in spite of the fact that such statements
look moduli dependent, they are actually moduli independent and therefore u-duality
invariant, as expected from physical considerations.

3 bps spectrum for 0-branes in type ii string theory

compactied on td, d = 1, . . . 4

in the present section we consider the bps spectrum and the central charge matrix for
0-branes in the cases when only 1/2 and 1/4 bps states exist. these are the cases where
the central charge has only two eigenvalues, as it happens for d = 1, . . . 4.

let us consider the relevant anticommutators, containing the scalar central charge,

d = 1
d = 2

d = 3

d = 4

(i, j = 1, 2); zij real symmetric

{qi, qj} = zij
{qa, qb} = zii

ab = zab (a, b = 1, 2);
z i complex, zab symmetric,

{qa, qb} = zij (ij)ab = zab

(a, b = 1, . . . 4);

zab symmetric and symplectic

{qa, q

b} = zab

(a, b = 1, . . . 4); zab symplectic

(3.33)

where i are the pauli matrices and ij = 1/2[i, j] (i are the o(5) gamma matrices).
we say that zab is a symplectic (or quaternionic) matrix if:

z = z

where  is the bilinear form invariant under usp(4) which satises

the indices a, b in the gamma matrices are raised and lowered with .

 =  = t = 1

(3.34)

(3.35)

cases d = 1, 2.
in these cases the chare matrix z is 22 and has two independent
eigenvalues. the 1/2 bps conditions correspond to these eigenvalues equal in magnitude.
we consider separately both cases.

 for d = 1, z is real and symmetric. we can decompose it as

zij = y ij + z (t)ij

(3.36)

where  = 1, 2, t1 = 1 and t2 = 3 (the pauli matrices). the characteristic equation
for z is

where

2  trz  + detz = 0

trz = 2y
detz = y 2  z z

it then follows that the two solutions of (3.37) satisfy |1| = |2| if either

or

then implying

trz = 0

detz = 1/4(trz)2

y z z = 0.

(3.37)

(3.38)
(3.39)

(3.40)

(3.41)

(3.42)

it is obvious that condition (3.42) is only o(2) or r-invariant, but the unique solution
y z = 0, is an sl(2)o(1,1) or u-invariant. this is the rst example of a condition of
the type (2.17). so we retrieve the result of ref.[19] for d = 1, 1/2 bps states

q = 0 or

q = 0

(3.43)

 in the d = 2 case the hermiticity condition is lacking, but still the matrix z ii can
be diagonalized with real eigenvalues using (2.31), where the dierence between u1 and
u2 is simply a phase. we just use a transformation of the r-symmetry group u(2), with
su(2) acting on the -matrices and u(1) acting as a phase on z i.

in fact, note that

ziz i = (ai + ibi)(ai + ibi) = aiai  bibi + 2iaibi

(3.44)

10

therefore, with a u(1) transformation we bring aibi to zero, which means that ~a and ~b
are orthogonal vectors, so by an orthogonal transformation we can bring them to coincide
with the axes, and only two real numbers (related to the two eigenvalues) are left.

we proceed by diagonalizing the hermitian matrix zz . the square root of the eigen-
values will be the eigenvalues of z, that we denote by 1, 2. (in this way we include both
cases, when the eigenvalues are equal and when they are opposite in sign).we have :

trzz  = 2

[trzz  q2tr(zz )2  (trzz )2]

using now the properties of the  matrices,

zz  = z ii z j j = z i zii + iijkz i z j k

we denote zk = iijkz i z j. then we have

trzz  = 2z i zi, tr(zz )2 = 2[(z i zi)2 + zi zi],

(3.48)

hence, the discriminant in (3.46) is given by

tr(zz )2

(trzz )2 = 2 z i zi.

we set z i

we consider now the two cases separately,
 in the d = 3 case we can switch from sp(4) to o(5) indices by setting:

zab = zij (ij)ab,

(i, j = 1, . . . 5)

where zij is real and antisymmetric and

ij =

1
2

[i, j].

it is clear that zij can be skew-diagonalized with an o(5) transformation, so zab can be
diagonalized with a usp(4) transformation. from the relation

1
2{ij , kl} = (gijgkl  gjkgil + ijklp p )

zz  = z 2i + z p p ,

z 2 = 2z p qzp q, z p = p ijklzijzkl.

it follows that

where

from this, we have

trzz  = 4z 2

tr(zz )2 = 4z 4 + 4z p zp .

the 1/2 bps condition becomes:

tr(zz )2 

1
4

(trzz )2 = 4z p zp = 0

which is o(5) invariant and implies

z p = p ijklzij zkl = 0

(3.61)

(3.62)

equation(3.63) is sl(5) invariant when z ij is in the 10-dimensional representation of

sl(5), and therefore it is moduli independent, giving the result of ref. [19],

p ijklqij qkl = 0

(3.64)

 the d = 4 case was already discussed in ref.[5, 7], but we outline it here for
completeness. in this case, the matrix zab is a general o(5) bispinor. however, since its
square is hermitian it decomposes as

zz  = z 2i + z(l)
z z = z 2i + z(r)

p p ,
p = 1, . . . 5
p p with z(l)

p z(l)p = z(r)

p z(r)p .

(3.65)

12

where the subindices l, r refer to the two o(5) factors of the rsymmetry group.
follows that

it

the 1/2 bps condition is then :

trzz  = 4z 2, tr(zz )2 = 4z 4 + 4z(l)

p z(l)p .

(3.66)

(3.67)

(r), z p

tr(zz )2  1/4(trzz )2 = 4z(l)

p z(l)p = 0.

p z(l)p = z(r)

p z(r)p = 0 imply that the o(5) vectors z p

the equations z(l)
(l) vanish.
this is an o(5,5) invariant statement. (z, z ) form the 16 dimensional (chiral spinor) rep-
resentation of o(5,5) and the o(5,5) 10 dimensional (light-like vector) (trzz , trz z)
then vanishes when |z(l)| = |z(r)| = 0. we then retrieve the condition of ref.[19] on the
quantized charges in the spinor representation of o(5,5).

4 bps spectrum for the d = 5, 6 dimensional cases.

in this section we will examine the more interesting cases of d = 5, 6, corresponding to
supergravity compactied down to d = 4, 5 dimensions respectively.

the dierent bps states, preserving some fraction of supersymmetry, are classied by

the orbits of e6(6) and e7(7) respectively as given in table 2.2

to put this analogy in perspective it is useful to parametrize the set of bps charges
allowed by the duality constraints by their eigenvalues and some angular variables (which
can be removed by an r-symmetry transformation [20]). the duality constraints which
follow from the bps conditions are precisely those constraints which do not depend on
these extra angular variables and which can be removed by an h transformation in g.
these constraints will give dierent orbits corresponding to dierent bps conditions on
the 0-brane charges.

the dierent orbits of dierent bps levels will correspond to dierent solutions of
the characteristic equation of the central charge matrix (or its square). these dierent
solutions will be characterized by invariant constraints which are moduli independent in
spite of the fact that the eigenvalues of the matrix are moduli dependent. becuse of this,
the orbits are simply given by invariant constraints on the quantized charges, as found
in ref.[19].

we want to consider second derivatives of the above quartic invariant that could give us
covariant equations. the antisymmetric matrix zab is in the 28-dimensional representa-
tion of su(8), while we can express symbolically z56 = (zab, z ab), in the 56-dimensional
representation of e7 (56 = 28 + 28). taking the the second derivative

will give us a quadratic polynomial which is a symmetric tensor, in the (5656)s = 1596
representation of e7 which is not irreducible and decomposes as 1463 + 133. 133 is the
adje7, so we can project on that space as indicated above (4.70). since 133 decomposes
as 63+70 under su(8), the expression (4.70) splits into the two following su(8) covariant
polynomials

four coinciding eigenvalues (that is, it is a multiple of the identity), while the equation

(pf z)2 = (detzz )1/2.

plugging (4.84) into (4.81) and squaring, it gives (detzz )1/2 as in (4.78).

in the same way one can show that the equation giving tr(zz )3 as in (4.78) is the

5 bps conditions for theories with 16 supersymme-

tries

in this last section we will extend our analysis to theories with 16 supersymmetries. these
theories are obtained in three dierent ways: by compactifying heterotic string theory on
td (1  d  6), from m theory compactied on k3 (d = 7) and from type iia theory
compactied on k3 (d = 6).
in the theories where matter vector elds exist, the duality group g depends on the
matter content and on the space-time dimension d.
its maximal compact subgroup
is hr  hm where hr is the r-symmetry and hm is the group acting on the matter
multiplets. in our case, hm =o(n), where n is the number of matter multiplets. g is of

17

the form o(10-d, n)o(1,1) for 5  d  9 while for d = 4 it is sl(2)o(6,n). the
r-symmetry groups are o(10-d) for 5  d  9 and o(6)o(2)su(4)u(1) for d=4.
the last result can easily been understood from the geometric symmetry of heterotic
string on t6, where g is enlarged by the electric-magnetic duality for 0-branes.

the g and hr representations of the 0-branes are given in the following tables.

central charge representation of hr.

(5.98)

from the above table, and according our previous analysis, it follows that the central
charge matrix za has only one independent eigenvalue for d = 1, . . . 4 and two independent
eigenvalues for d = 5, 6. therefore, for d = 1, . . . 4 only 1/2 bps states can occur while
for d = 5, 6 both, 1/2 and 1/4 bps states can occur.

(5.99)

we consider now separately the two cases d = 5, 6.

case d = 5. this is the case which corresponds to heterotic string on t5 or m the-
ory (type iia, type iib) on k3t2 (k3s1).
in such compactications, n = 21, so
g=o(5,21) o(1,1) but our analysis is independent of this specic number n.
z = z decomposes as

the central charge z is an antisymmetric symplectic matrix. the hermitian matrix,

where a are the o(5) -matrices and z a, z 0 are real. it follows that

z = z aa + z 0i

trz = 0 or

being the plus sign the mass squared of the bps state.

we discuss now the covariance of (5.104). since z0 = e2m where e2 parametrizes
o(1,1) and m is the charge associated to z0, z0 = 0 implies m = 0 which is an o(5,n)
singlet, so it is g-invariant.

according to table (5) we write the projection of the coset representative over the
(5+n, -1) representation as el
a is the coset rep-
resentative of o(5+n)/o(5)o(n). if zi, i = 1, . . . n are the matter charges associated
to the n matter multiplets, we have that, because of (2.29)

a where  parametrizes o(1,1) and l

o(5)za =

1
4

tr(api)z i  zad

(5.106)

therefore za = 0 implies zi = 0. this is also an o(5,n) invariant statement since, it
comes by dierentiating the quadratic invariant polynomial

i =

5

xa=1

zaz a 

m

xi=1

ziz i.

(5.107)

therefore, za = zi = 0 implies q = 0 where q,  = 1, . . . 5 + n, is a xed charge vector
of o(5,m), as found in [19].

case d = 6, (d = 4). we now consider theories with 16 supersymmetries in d = 4,
as heterotic string compactied on t6, typeii on k3t2 or m theory on k3t3. the
new phenomenon which occurs here is the electric-magnetic duality of 0-branes which are
assigned to the (2, 6 + n) representation of su(1,1)o(6,n).
the central charge is a 4 dimensional complex matrix zab, antisymmetric in the
su(4)o(6) indices. therefore, the matrix zz  has two independent eigenvalues, given
by the characteristic equation

a generic 1/4 bps state has m2

bp s equal to the eigenvalue with + sign above. the
1/2 bps conguration corresponds to a vanishing discriminant, i.e. 1 = 2. we would
like to show how this condition is su(1,1)o(6,n) invariant in the sense that it is moduli
independent in spite of the fact that the discriminant is moduli dependent.
for this purpose we proceed like for the maximally supersymmetric case in d = 4. if

the two eigenvalues of zz  coincide, then the hermitian traceless matrix

the fact that i is an invariant was derived in ref.[30] and can be easily understood from
the fact that (i1, i2, i2) is a triplet of su(1,1)o(1,2), each of the entries being o(6,n)
invariant.
the equation (5.110) can be seen as the second derivative of i projected onto the

adjoint representation of su(4).

is in the symmetric product ((2, 6 + n)  (2, 6 + n)) |s, which decomposes under o(6,m)
as (3, sym)+(1,adjo(6,n))= (3,1)+ (3,trsym)+(1,adjo(6,n)), where sym is the two
fold symmetric representation, trsym is the traceless symmetric representation. to show
that the v c
a = 0 is a g-invariant statement we use the fact that adjo(6,n) decomposes
under o(6)o(n) as adjo(6,n)7 (adjo(6),1)+(1, adjo(n)) +(6,n). we will show that
the vanishing of the projection onto adjo(6) adjsu (4) of (5.114) implies the vanishing
of the projection onto (1, adjo(n)) and (6,n). in fact, dierentiating v c
a = 0 and using
the dierential identities (2.29) one also nds

zi zj  zizj = 0,
abcd z cd zj = 0.

the vanishing of the three equations v c
a = 0, (5.115) and (5.116) implies that the projec-
tion of (5.114) on ado(6,n) vanishes. this is a su(1,1)so(6,n) invariant and therefore
the moduli dependence drops out. these three equations can be rewritten in terms of the

20

xed charges (q, p), in the (6+n) of o(6,n) times the fundamental representation of
sl(2)su(1,1)) as

t (a)
 = qp  pq = 0.

note that in this basis the projection of (5.114) onto the representation (3,sym) is

t (s)
 = (qq, pp,

(qp + pq))

whose trace part is the sl(2) triplet (q2.p2, q  p). it can be written as a matrix

t (0) = (cid:18) q2

 t (a)

q  p
p2 (cid:19) .

the invariant i can be written either as t (a)
or as dett 0, and its square root is the
entropy formula for 1/4 bps 0-branes in theories with sixteen supersymmetries [17, 32].

as a nal remark, let us comment on the orbits of the o(5,n) and o(6,n) vectors for

bps congurations discussed above.

for 1/2 bps states at d = 5 we have mq = 0, so either m or q vanish. in the former
case, the bps condition requires q to be time-like or light-like (qq  0) [19] so the
orbit is either o(5,n)/o(4)o(n) or o(5,n)/io(4,n  1). if m 6= 0 then q = 0, so the
orbit is a point since the little group is o(5,n) itself.
let us consider now the d = 6 case. the bps condition corresponds to the statement

that the matrix t (0) is positive semidenite. this implies

dett (0) = q2p2  (q  p)2  0, trt (0) = q2 + p2  0.

(5.120)

from this it follows that q2  0 and p2  0.

dett (0) = 0 corresponds to 1/2 bps states; this happens when q = p, (  0).
for dett (0) > 0, q2 > 0 and p2 > 0 and the generic 1/4 bps conguration will depend
on ve parameters, since p, q, by an o(2) transformation in sl(2) can be made orthogonal
(qp  = 0). indeed, the rst vector can be put in the form (p1, 0,   , 0, pn+1, 0,   , 0)
and the second in the form (q1, q2, 0,   , 0, qn+1, qn+2, 0,   , 0) by an o(6)o(n) transfor-
mation. the orthogonality condition is used to eliminate one of the six parameters. the
remaining 7 + 2n parameters are the angles in o(2)o(6)o(n)/o(4)o(n-2). the
little group in g of the two time-like vectors is o(4)o(n).
