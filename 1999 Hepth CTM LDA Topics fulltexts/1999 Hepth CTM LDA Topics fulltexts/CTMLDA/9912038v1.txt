abstract

we derive the noncommutative dirac-born-infeld action for the d-brane,

which governs dynamics of d-brane with a ns-ns b-eld in the low energy

regime. depending on some details of the path integral prescriptions, both or-

dinary dirac-born-infeld action and noncommutative one can be obtained by

evaluating the same polyakov string path integral for the open string ending

on the d-brane. thus, it establishes the equivalence of the noncommutative

dirac-born-infeld action and the ordinary one.

i. introduction

the dirichlet brane [1], abbreviated to d-brane, is considered as one of the most impor-

tant physical object to understand various aspects of string theories. it has been the key

ingredient to the subjects of dualities [2], black hole physics [3], ads/cf t correspondence

[4], and matrix m-model in modern string theory [5]. before the advent of the d-brane,

fradkin and tseytlin [6] computed the eective action for an open string coupled to u(1)

gauge eld and found that it is given by the born-infeld action at the tree level. later

leigh [7] studied the sigma model action for an open string in the d-brane background

by requiring the conformal invariance and found that the eective action for the d-brane

should be the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action in the low energy regime. then the dbi ac-

tion has been often adopted to discuss the diverse subjects in string theory in which the

d brane plays an essential role. the dp-brane is the (p + 1) dimensional hypersurfaces in

space-time where the open strings can end and its dynamics is induced mostly by the open

strings attached on it. the open string gives rise to the noncommutative geometry [8] for

the d-brane when a ns-ns b-eld is present. the d-brane dynamics is then described

by yang-mills gauge elds on noncommutative space-time [9]. most recently seiberg and

witten [10] proposed interesting relationships between the ordinary gauge elds and non-

commutative gauge elds and in particular the equivalence of the ordinary dirac-born-infeld

action and the noncommutative one.

in the present paper we derive the noncommutative dirac-born-infeld action for the

d-brane, which governs dynamics of d-brane with a ns-ns b-eld. we show that both

ordinary dbi action and noncommutative one can be obtained by evaluating the same

polyakov string path integral for the open string ending on the d-brane. the dierence in

derivation of two dbi action only reside in some details of the path integral prescriptions.

thus, it establishes the equivalence of the noncommutative dirac-born-infeld action and the

ordinary one. the ordinary dbi action would be obtained [6] if we employ the neumann

function as the green function on the disk and treat the terms involving the ns-ns b-eld

2

and the u(1) gauge eld as interaction. when b-eld is constant, we do not need to treat

the term involving b-eld as interaction. we may include this term in the kinetic part of the

action, quadratic in string variables, and dene the green function with respect to it. in this

case it is useful to employ our previous canonical analysis [11]: the end points of the string,

where the u(1) gauge eld is coupled to, obey noncommutativity and the classical action

becomes equivalent to that of open string in the space-time with some eective metric, ge. it

suggests us that we may get the noncommutative dbi action where the space-time metric is

replaced by the eective one ge and the ordinary u(1) eld strength by its noncommutative

counterpart. we may include the term with b-eld partly in the kinetic part and partly

in the interaction term. then, the derivation to be presented in this paper also suggests

more general form of equivalence between the ordinary gauge elds and the noncommutative

gauge elds, which is similar to one discussed in ref. [10].

ii. open string on d-brane and dbi action

we begin with a brief review of the work of fradkin and tseytlin [6] on dbi action. the

bosonic part of the classical action for an open string ending on a dp-brane with a b-eld

is given by

i = i1 + i2

=

1

4 zm

d2"ghh x 



x 

  2ibij x i



x j

 #

(1)

where  = 0, 1, . . . , 9 and i = 0, 1, . . . , p and (0, 1) = (, ). here gij = gij =constant,

h = db = 0 and h = . since the longitudinal string variables x ,  = p + 1, . . . , 9

can be treated rather trivially, we will be concerned with the transverse variables x i only

afterwards. at the tree level, the world surface of the open string is a disk on the d-brane.

the interaction with u(1) gauge eld is introduced through a wilson loop dened on m,

the boundary of the world surface,

w [a] = p exp(cid:18)izm

d ai(x) x i(cid:19)

3

(2)

where  is the parameter along m and p denotes the path ordered product. to be explicit,

we choose  as

 = 


  1
 + 1

:

:

  [1, 0]
  [0, 1].

(3)

the eective action for the d-brane is given as the polyakov string path integral on the

disk

 =

1
gs

n z d[x] exp (i) w [a]

(4)

where gs is the string coupling constant and n is a normalization constant. using the stokes

theorem we may write the wilson loop operator in the string path integral as

w [a] = exp 

i

2 zm

d2 fij x i


x j

 ! .

for a slow varying u(1) gauge eld or a constant fij

w [a] = exp 

i

2 zm

d fijx i x j

 ! = exp(i3).

for constant b-eld we also write

i2 = 

i

2 zm

bij x i
a

x j
 = 

i

2 zm

d bijx i x j


.

therefore,

i2 + i3 = 

i

2 zm

d (b + f )ijx i x j


.

note that (b + f ) is invariant under the gauge transformation where

a  a + , b  b  d

for any one-form .

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

in order to evaluate the path integral it is convenient to diagonalize the space-time

metric, introducing

x i

n = c i

jz j
n,

(c t gc)ij = ij

(10)

4

it follows that

z d[x] = z yn0,i

dx i

n = z yn0,i

dz i

n yn0

det c = z d[z](det g)

4 .

(11)

where we use (0) = pn 1 = 1/2 and det c = (det g) 1

to the canonical analysis [11] the string normal modes, x i

2 . here we note that according

n are subject to the following

constraints for the free open string

x i

n = x i

n, n = 1, 2, . . . .

(12)

in evaluating the path integral we may treat i2 and i3 as interaction terms. it implies that

the green function on the disk is chosen as the neumann function



 h 

 ng = (  ).



thus, the path integral may be written as

 =

where zi = z i|m and

d

zj#

g(1, 2) = ng(z(1), z(2)), g1g = (1  2).

employing the result of ref. [6], we have

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

where we choose n = 1/(2)p. absorbing the factor (det g)

1

into the string coupling

constant, we get the dbi lagrangian

ldbi =

gs(2)p()

p+1

2 qdet (g + 2(b + f )).

(17)

iii. noncommutative geometry

when we derive the dbi action, we treat the term with the b-eld as interaction.

however, since it is quadratic in string variables if b-eld is constant, we may include it in

the kinetic part of the action. the green function is dened with respect to i1 + i2 instead

of i1. our previous canonical analysis [11] shows that in this case the open string action is

equivalent to that of free open string in the space time with metric given by ge,

(ge)ij = (cid:16)g  (2)2bg1b(cid:17)ij

.

(18)

the hamiltonian and the string coordinate variable are written in the phase space (y i

n, k i

by

h = (2)

pi(g1

e )ijpj + (2)xn=1( 1

{kin, kjm} = 0

in this representation, it is clear that the string variables are noncommutative. in particular,

the ends points of the open string

zi = x i(0) = xi 
zi = x i() = xi +

satisfy

[zi, zj] = iij,

[zi, zj] = iij.

(23)

the vertex operators carrying momenta k and k are associated with eikizi and eiki zi.

hence, their operator algebra are given as

eikzeiqz = ei 

2 kiij qj

ei(k+q)z,

eikzeiqz = ei 

2 kiij qj

ei(k+q)z,

eikzeiqz = eikz+iqz

(24)

where we make use of the identity

eaeb = e

1

2 [a,b]ea+b,

if [[a, b], a] = [[a, b], b] = 0.

(25)

the above noncommutative relations yield that the normal ordered product of two operators

are given as the moyal bracket [12] as discussed in [10]. in general, a product of two functions

of z is written as

f (z)g(z) = z dk

2 z dq

2

ei 

2 kiij qj

ei(k+q)z f(k)g(q),

(26)

where f and g are fourier transformed functions of f and g respectively. it follows that

normal ordered product of two operators satisfy

: f (z) :: g(z) : = : f (z)  g(z) :

(27)



 j! f (z + )g(z + )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

.

(28)

where

the physical observables are often represented by wilson loop operators. consider a

wilson loop operator of u(1) gauge eld on the d-brane, given as follows

wc[a] = p exp(cid:20)ic

dx iai(x)(cid:21)

(29)

where p denotes the path ordered product. let us take that c is the boundary of the world

surface of the open string on the d-brane, m and is parameterize by  :

x i( )|m = 


and x i( = 1) = x i( = 1).

with the commutation relations eq.(23), we write the expectation value of the wilson

loop operator as

where j(b) is a trivial jacobian and . . . denotes the kinetic terms for nonzero modes and

constraint terms. note the dierence between the  ordered product and the path ordered

product. if  -ordering is employed, on m

eip xeiqx = ei 

2 p iij qj

ei(p +q)x = eip x  eiqx.

(32)

we may expand the wilson loop operator as

wc[a] = i +zm

(33)

expanding ai[x( )] also and using eq.(32) we get

hwc[a]i = *i +zm

the noncommutative stokes theorem needs a more rigorous proof.

iv. noncommutative dbi action

being equipped with the canonical analysis [11] and the discussion on the noncommuta-

tive geometry given in the previous section, we evaluate the polyakov string path integral.

with the prescription given in the previous section the polyakov string path integral repre-

senting the eective action is read as

 =

(37)

where w [a] = p exp(cid:16)irm d ai(x) x i(cid:17). as discussed if we include the b-eld term in

the kinetic part of the action, the wilson loop operator in the polyakov path integral may

be rewritten as

hw [a]i = *exp"

for a slow varying u(1) gauge eld, we may also write the wilson loop operator as

(42)

the last term in eq.(42) may be neglected in the limit of slowly varying elds, where the
dbi action is valid, since it produces terms of o( f ) in the eective action.

we nd that the string path integral eq.(43a) coincides with eq.(4), if the eective metric

gij substitutes for the space-time metric gij and the noncommutative eld strength f for

(b + f ). then, the same procedure which leads to the ordinary dbi action, yields

v. concluding remarks

in ref. [10] seiberg and witten discussed the equivalence between the noncommutative

gauge theory and the ordinary one and the change of variables between them in an explicit

from. the proposed equivalence was checked by comparing the noncommutative dbi with

the ordinary one, both of which are supposed to describe the same d-brane with a ns-ns

b-eld.

in the present paper we derive the noncommutative dbi action, evaluating the

polyakov string path integral on a disk, which depicts the world surface of the open string

ending on the d-brane. we get both noncommutative dbi and ordinary dbi from the same

polyakov string path integral. thus, it is established that the noncommutative dbi action

is equivalent to the ordinary one. some details of the prescriptions for the path integral

make the dierence. if b-eld is constant, the term involving the b-eld can be treated as

a part of interaction or as a part of kinetic term, since it is quadratic in string variables. in

the former case we get the ordinary dbi action and in the latter case the noncommutative

one. in ref. [10] two descriptions, one by the ordinary gauge theory and the other by the

noncommutative one are shown to dier by the choice of regularization for the world-sheet

theory; the pauli-villars regularization yields the ordinary commutative gauge symmetry

while the point-splitting regularization yields the noncommutative one. the analysis of the

string path integral in the present paper may be compared with theirs.

since whether the term with b-eld is put in the kinetic part or in the interaction part

is optional, we may get a more general form of the noncommutative dbi action. we may

split the term with the b-eld into two and put one in the kinetic part and the rest in the

interaction part. then the string path integral will leads us to a more general form of the

noncommutative dbi action. thus, our description of the noncommutative dbi provides a

useful tool to examine the interesting proposal made in [10] in some details. it is interesting

to explore further its consequence [13]. the open strings attached to the multi-d-branes or

to two dierent types of d-branes can be treated in similar ways. it is certainly interesting to

understand the noncommutative non-abelian dbi action in the framework presented here.
