we study a two-dimensional disordered system consisting of dirac fermions coupled to a scalar po-
tential. this model is closely related to a more general disordered system that has been introduced in
conjunction with the integer quantum hall transition. after disorder averaging, the interaction can be
written as a marginal osp(2|2) current-current perturbation. the osp(2|2) current-current model in turn
can be viewed as the fully renormalized version of an osp(2|2)(1) toda-type system (at the marginal
point). we build non-local charges for the toda system satisfying the uq [osp(2|2)(1)] quantum superal-
gebra. the corresponding quantum group symmetry is used to construct a toda s -matrix for the vector
representation. we argue that in the marginal (or rational) limit, this s -matrix gives the exact (yangian
symmetric) physical s -matrix for the fundamental solitons of the osp(2|2) current-current model.

1. introduction

non-perturbative techniques have proven to be very useful in the investigation of interacting eld theories.
this is especially true in two-dimensions, where rich symmetry structures have allowed the calculation of
fundamental quantities, such as exact s -matrices and correlation functions, for many important models.
in recent times, this progress has been further advanced by a better understanding of the mathematical
framework underlying the symmetry structures. perhaps this is most apparent in the construction of exact s -
matrices for integrable 2d systems. here a knowledge of the symmetry algebra and its representation theory is
essential to building a s -matrix satisfying the yang-baxter constraint [16]. well known examples of models
with exact s -matrices include the sine-gordon/massive thirring model [79], gross-neveu models [1012],
principal chiral and sigma-type models [1316], various statistical systems, such as rsos systems [17,18], and
toda theories based on lie algebras [1924]. a relatively new class of models that have been investigated are
based on lie superalgebras. supersymmetric toda models belong to this category and their exact s -matrices
have been calculated [25, 26].

in this paper we use the s -matrix approach to study a model based on the lie superalgebra osp(2|2),
which is closely related to a disordered system introduced to describe the integer quantum hall transi-
tion [27]. as shown by bernard [28], the model arises after disorder averaging over a random scalar potential
and consists of a free fermionic and bosonic piece, combined with a marginal osp(2|2) current-current per-
turbation. the bosonic part is the result of rewriting the fermion partition function as a path integral over
complex bosonic variables. this pairs the fermions and bosons thus making the action supersymmetric.
the model is integrable with factorized scattering and yangian symmetry. by introducing an anisotropy,
which allows us to ow between a relevant and marginal perturbation, we construct non-local charges for half
the current-current operators. the remaining current-current operators are generated under renormalization
at the marginal point. the non-local charges are shown to satisfy the uq [osp(2|2)(1)] quantum superalge-
bra and to be conserved to lowest order in conformal perturbation theory. requiring the theory to have
uq [osp(2|2)(1)] quantum group symmetry, we calculate the s -matrix, or more appropriately the r-matrix,
for the fundamental vector representation. the physical s -matrix is then obtained, up to cdd factors, by
imposing the unitarity and crossing constraints. we propose that in the marginal limit this s -matrix is the
exact s -matrix (in the fundamental representation) with yangian symmetry for the osp(2|2) current-current
model. the particle spectrum of the model and the corresponding s -matrix are massive. in particular, this
means that all states are anderson localized.

the quantum hall disordered system discussed in [27] contains three types of randomness. though the
generic case, with all types of randomness present, is not believed to be integrable, it is certainly possible
that on some submainifold in the three coupling parameter space the model can be exactly solved. various
such subspaces have already been investigated [2729]. an interesting subset was recently studied in [30]
(see also [31]), where supersymmetric disorder averaging led to a gl(n|n ) current-current type model for
which exact correlation functions were computed. our s -matrix analysis considers the situation where there
is only one specic type of disorder, namely a random scalar potential.

we present our results as follows. in section 2 we write down the models and show how the full current
algebra is generated under renormalization. the non-local charges are constructed in section 3. from
the quantum group structure we build the s -matrix for the fundamental representation in section 4. the
pole structure is briey discussed in section 5. lastly we conclude with a summary and comment on open
questions for further study. an appendix reviews the osp(2|2) algebras.

2. the osp(2|2) eld theory models
2a. the osp(2|2) current-current model

the model introduced by ludwig et al. in connection with the integer quantum hall transition consists
of a dirac fermion (, ) coupled to, in the most general case, three types of randomness: a random
vector potential a, a random mass m, and a random scalar potential v . the euclidean action takes the

2

form (z = t + ix)

s =z d2x

2 (cid:16)(z  iaz)+ + (z  iaz)+ + i

m(x)

2

(+  +) + i

v (x)

2

(+ + +)(cid:17). (2.1)

the model we are interested in only contains a random scalar potential (a = m = 0), which is taken to have
a gaussian distribution with mean zero and positive variance gv

p [v ] = exp(cid:18)

4gv z d2x

v (x)2(cid:19) .

using the supersymmetric method and averaging over v (x) leads to the eective action [28]

the action scft is anti-hermitian and has a central charge of zero, c = 0, since c, = 1. one can view se
as a perturbed (non-unitary) conformal eld theory (cft). note that the perturbation is marginal (v has
dimension 2). we will see below that the perturbation is actually marginally relevant.

as in the random bond ising model [28,32,33], the following supersymmetric current algebra is a symmetry

of the conformal action scft

g(z) = (z)(z),

k(z) =: 2(z) :,

j(z) =: +(z)(z) :, h(z) =: (z)(z) :

bg(z) = (z)(z)
bk(z) =: 2(z) :
bg(z) = (z)(z)
bk(z) =  : 2(z) :

g(z) = (z)(z),
(z) :,

k(z) =  : 

2

j(z) =: +(z)(z) :, h(z) =: (z)(z) : .

(2.9)

(2.10)

(in this paper we use the term supersymmetry merely to mean a symmetry algebra/transformation based
on some lie superalgebra and not space-time supersymmetry in the usual sense.) here : . . . : denotes normal
ordering, namely : a(w)b(w) : is the coecient of (z  w)0 in the ope a(z)b(w). these currents form a
level one representation of the ane osp(2|2)(1) current algebra. the rank two osp(2|2) lie superalgebra has
six roots, four odd or fermionic and two even or bosonic. the gs, being fermionic, are associated with
the fermionic roots and the ks with the bosonic roots. the two simple roots, (1, 2) can be chosen to
be both fermionic or one fermionic and one bosonic. we will choose a purely fermionic simple root system.

3

with this choice the additional ane root, 0 = (1 + 2), is associated with k(z) (or bk(z)).

osp(2|2) algebras are discussed in the appendix.) the non-trivial opes for the currents are

and similarly for the anti-holomorphic currents. we want to emphasize that even though some of the anti-
holomorphic currents (2.10) dier from their holomorphic counterparts (2.9) by signs (e.g. k =: 2 : but
k =  : 
:), their opes are nevertheless the same, i.e., the usual opes obtained from (2.11) by replacing
all operators o(z) by o(z).

2

the eld v can now be written as

v = 2(cid:20)j j  hh +

1
2

(kbk + bkk) + gbg+  bgg+ + g+bg  bg+g(cid:21) ,

which is of the current-current form (see appendix). the interaction is thus a current-current perturbation
that preserves the osp(2|2) symmetry of scft. furthermore, this implies that se has yangian symmetry [28].
any s -matrix we construct must respect this yangian symmetry.
the operator v alone forms a closed algebra. its ope can be calculated using (2.7) and (2.8) (or (2.11)

and its anti-holomorphic version), and is found to be

v (z, z)v (w, w)  

8

|z  w|2 v (w, w).

this leads to the beta function (to lowest order)

g =

dg

d log r

= g2,

(2.13)

(2.14)

where r is a length scale (see section 2b) and henceforth we drop the v subscript on gv , writing g  gv .
we see that the perturbation is marginally relevant: g (which is positive by denition) increases at large
distances. the theory is asymptotically free in the uv. the model se is thus in a massive regime and the
s -matrix we calculate will describe scattering of massive particles. the behaviour here is opposite to that
of the random bond ising/random mass model. the random mass model (a = v = 0) perturbing eld m ,
with coupling gm , can also be written as a current-current perturbation [28]. this requires redening four
of the osp(2|2) currents as

k  k, bk  bk, g  g, bg+  bg+,

4

(2.15)

with all other currents unchanged. the operator algebra is unchanged under this transformation. one nds
that

due to the minus sign, the beta function changes sign

m (z, z) = v (z, z).

gm = g2
m ,

(2.16)

(2.17)

in this case one

giving a marginally irrelevant perturbation that is asymptotically free in the infra-red.
expects to ow to a massless regime.
2b. the osp(2|2)(1) toda-type model

one can try to construct the yangian charges for (2.3) and then use these to build the s -matrix. however
we will follow an alternative approach along the lines of [34], which though being less direct, is easier to
apply.

in [34] it is shown that the yangian symmetry associated with a current-current perturbation of the wzw
model (based on a simply laced lie algebra) can be extracted (as a marginal limit) from a smaller model.
this smaller model, which is simply a toda system with imaginary coupling, contains only current-current
operators corresponding to the ane simple roots. the reason for working with this smaller model is that
one can construct an ane quantum group (q-deformed) structure, using the method of non-local charges,
only for the toda system. the full current-current perturbation is recovered through renormalization of
the toda model (see below). from the ane quantum group symmetry the s -matrix can be constructed.
the marginal limit of the toda s -matrix then leads to the yangian symmetric s -matrix for the original
current-current model.

we now apply the same reasoning to the osp(2|2) model. as in the lie algebra case, quantum group
charges cannot be constructed for the full model (2.3). a smaller model which does have quantum group
symmetry, as we will show in the next section, consists of taking only half the terms in (2.12). its action
takes the form

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

with scft as in (2.4) and

s = scft +

g

4z d2x

2

v ,

v = 2(cid:20)1

2 bkk + gbg+ + g+bg(cid:21) .

the current terms retained correspond to the ane simple roots of osp(2|2)(1). we have also dropped the
cartan terms jj and hh. thus (2.18) is the supersymmetric analog of the toda system used in [34] to
study current-current perturbations of the wzw model. (in order to construct the quantum charges one
needs to introduce an additional parameter  in (2.19), which serves to make the perturbation relevant.
the model (2.18) is then understood as the marginal limit   1 of the deformed model. this will become
clearer in the next section.)
unlike the full model, s is not renormalizable. the reason being that the operators in (2.19) do not form
a closed algebra by themselves. more generally, consider a marginal perturbation of a cft by some set of
operators {oi(z, z)}

s = scft +xi z d2x gioi(z, z).

for (2.20) to be renormalizable, the operator algebra for the set {oi} must close onto itself. that is to say
the opes must be of the form

oi(z, z)oj(w, w)  cij

k

1

|z  w|2 ok(w, w),

(2.21)

for some structure constants cij
(2.20). in this case zamolodchikov [35] has shown that the beta functions to lowest order (1 loop) are

k , with any operators appearing in (2.21) already being present in the action

gi =

dgi

d log r

= cjk

i gjgk.

5

(2.22)

specializing to (2.18), the action can be written as

s = scft +

giz d2xoi,

3xi=1

where

and we have allowed the couplings to be independent. running the renormalization procedure, one nds
that after the rst iteration the following operators are generated

o1 = gbg+, o2 = g+bg, o3 = bkk,

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

these correspond to the negative simple roots. however, the operator algebra for {oi}1i6 still does not
close. a second run generates the cartan operators

o4 = bg+g, o5 = bgg+, o6 = kbk.

o7 = (h + j)(h + j), o8 = (h  j)(h  j), o9 = hh.

the operator algebra for {oi}1i9 closes, and the resulting action is

the beta functions are found using (2.22) to be

s = scft +z d2x

9xi=1

gioi.

(2.26)

(2.27)

g1 = 2g1(4g8 + g9) + 8g5g6,

g2 = 2g2(4g7 + g9) + 8g4g6

g3 = 8g3(g7 + g8 + g9) + 2g4g5

g4 = 2g4(4g8 + g9) + 8g2g3,

g5 = 2g5(4g7 + g9) + 8g1g3

g6 = 8g6(g7 + g8 + g9) + 2g1g2

g7 = 2g1g4,

g8 = 2g2g5

g9 = 32g3g6.

(2.28)

we can easily verify that a solution to (2.28) exists which gives the original model (2.3) and its beta function
(2.14). since (2.3) contains only one coupling, we should try the ansatz gi =  1
4 ig, where i are some
numerical constants. (we remark that the is do not spoil the quantum group symmetry and one can work
with (2.23) using this ansatz instead of (2.18).) it is straight-forward to check that the set

{1 = 2 = 1, 3 =

1
2

, 4 = 5 = 1, 6 =

1
2

, 7 = 8 =

1
2

, 9 = 2},

(2.29)

reproduces (2.3) and reduces (2.28) to the single beta function (2.14) for g. thus under renormalization
(2.18) leads to the osp(2|2) current-current model. we will therefore construct the s -matrix for the toda-type
system (2.18) and argue that it gives the required s -matrix for (2.3) in the marginal limit.

3. quantum group symmetry in the osp(2|2) models

3a. non-local charges and conformal perturbation theory

quantum group symmetry is realized by non-local charges [34, 3638] constructed using conformal per-

turbation theory. we outline the main points of the construction below. (for more details see [34].)

suppose we have a cft perturbed by a relevant spin-zero eld

pert.(z, z) = pert.(z)pert.(z),

(3.1)

6

with the euclidean action

and some currents {j a, j

a

s = scft + gz d2x

2

pert.(z, z),

} which are chiral when g = 0

zj a = zj

a

= 0 = j a = j a(z), j

a

= j

a

(z).

(3.2)

(3.3)

in the perturbed theory (3.2) these currents are no longer chiral, but to lowest order in g satisfy the following
equations of motion [39]

zj a(z, z) = giz
(z, z) = giz

zj

a

d2w

a

(z).

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

if the residues of the opes on the righthand side are total derivatives

resz=w(pert.(w)j a(z)) = zha(z), resz=w(pert.(w)j

a

(z)) = zh

a

(z),

then (3.4) becomes

where

zj a(z, z) = zh a(z, z),

a

zj

(z, z) = zh

a

(z, z),

h a(z, z) = gha(z)pert.(z), h

a

a
(z, z) = gh

(z)pert.(z).

the equations of motion (3.6) imply that to lowest order in g we have the conserved charges

qa =

1

2i(cid:18)z dz j a +z dz h a(cid:19)
2i(cid:18)z dz j
a(cid:19) .

}, are non-local. to see this consider

scft =

1

8z d2xxi

ii.

in the limit g = 0, i can be expanded into its chiral components, i(z, z) = i(z) + i(z), with

hi(z)j(w)i = ij log(z  w),

hi(z)j(w)i = ij log(z  w).

(3.9)

(3.10)

if g 6= 0, i can again be written as i(x, t) = i(x, t) + i(x, t), but now i(x, t) and i(x, t) are no longer
chiral. for arbitrary g, i(x, t) and i(x, t) can be written in the non-local way

i(x, t) =

i(x, t) =

1

2(cid:18)i(x, t) +z x
2(cid:18)i(x, t) z x

1





dyti(y, t)(cid:19) g=0
dyti(y, t)(cid:19) g=0

= i(z)

= i(z).

(3.11)

since the currents are in general functions of i and i, they are non-local due to (3.11). this non-locality
leads to non-trivial braiding relations for the currents

j a(x, t)j

a

(y, t) = raa
bb

j

b

(y, t)j b(x, t),

(3.12)

7

where raa
bb
whether the currents are even (bosonic) or odd (fermionic). the corresponding result for the charges is

is a braiding matrix which will depend on the couplings and the parities of the currents, i.e.

where t aa is a topological charge

(3.13)

(3.14)

3b. bosonization and the  parameters

the above formalism is valid for a relevant perturbation. however, the perturbing eld (2.19) is marginal.
by making the currents depend on a parameter , the perturbation can be made relevant, with the marginal
limit being   1. in order to introduce this additional parameter the action (2.18) has to be (partially)
bosonized.

the fermions can be bosonized in the standard way

(z) = ei1(z), (z) = ei1(z).

(3.15)

the bosonic ghosts can be written as [40, 41]

(z) = e2(z)(z),

(z) = e2(z)(z)

(3.16)
the chiral bosons {i(z), i(z)} satisfy (3.10), and {(z), (z)} and {(z), (z)} are fermionic ghost systems
with conformal dimensions and opes

(z) = e2(z)(z),

(z) = e2(z) (z).

the central charge for the ghost system, c,, is 2. the osp(2|2)(1) currents expressed in terms of the new
elds become

j = i1,
h = 2, h =  2

g = exp(cid:16)i1,2  ~(cid:17) , g =  exp(cid:16)i1,2  ~(cid:17)

at the marginal point,  = 1, sd gives the bosonized version of s. the beta parameter is analogous to the
 (or ) parameter in the sine-gordon model [7, 34], and can be thought of as arising due to an anisotropy
in the current-current perturbation. if we add to (2.18) the term

1

8z d2x (cid:0)jj  hh(cid:1) =

1

8z d2x(cid:0)(1)2 + (2)2(cid:1) ,

and rescale i  i/1 + , one arrives at (3.27) with  = 1/1 + . in view of this one can interpret
sd as a deformation of (2.18).
indeed we will show that the beta parameter is related to the quantum
group deformation parameter. the toda-type structure is clearly seen in the bosonized form (3.29).
in
comparison with the lie algebraic toda models, the main dierence here is the inclusion of fermionic elds
due to supersymmetry.

for arbitrary positive values of , the three terms in sd

pert. do not have the same dimensions. the rst

two terms are marginal for all values of , whereas the remaining bkk term is relevant for  > 1. this

suggests that sd
pert. should be rewritten with two couplings, g1 and g2, with one of them being dimensionless,
which in turn seems to imply that conformal perturbation theory cannot be used to construct the non-local
charges. however, these problems can be resolved by introducing a background charge q coupled to the eld
2 [41]. the conformal dimensions of exp(i2) and exp(i2) are then changed from 2/2 to (  q)/2.
one nds that for a purely imaginary charge of

q = i

,

all three terms take of the same conformal dimensions and giving

(3.31)

(3.32)

therefore the perturbation as it is written in (3.29), with one coupling g, is consistent and can be treated as
being relevant for  > 1. since introducing q does not change the opes, the construction of the non-local
charges is identical for both cases q = 0 and q 6= 0. we choose to work with q = 0. all expressions
that follow, in particular the quantum group symmetry equations, also hold for q 6= 0. the only dierence
between q = 0 and q 6= 0 is that the spins of the charges are changed. this means that in going from
q = 0 to q 6= 0, the gradation of the quantum ane algebra changes from the homogeneous to the principal
gradation (see below). thus by taking q = 0 we are eectively working in the homogeneous gradation.

(3.41c)

to derive (3.41) one makes use of the non-local expressions (3.11) and the canonical commutation relations

from (3.41) one gets

[i(x, t), tj(y, t)] = ij4i(x  y).

(3.43b)

since (3.43b) involves applying (3.41a) and (3.41b), its validity for all x and y can be shown using a limiting
procedure. the relations (3.43), combined with (3.13) and (3.14), imply that the charges satisfy

the right-hand side of (3.44) can be written in terms of standard topological charges. we take a soliton

the topological charge of any fundamental soliton eld is always an integer. also the topological charges
are not all independent. in particular t 0 = (t 1 + t 2), which a statement of the fact that the center is

since i  j is always an even integer, we can take qi  qi without changing (3.46) or (3.48). the braiding
relations of the topological charges with the qs, which are simply (undeformed) commutators, are found
using

equation (3.50) is most easily obtained with the complex form for t i

(3.52c)
the topological charges are even or bosonic operators, with parities di  d(t i) = 0. note that in the above
braiding/commutation relations, the only purpose served by the - fermion elds is to produce the correct
graded structure, namely the (1)didj factors. unlike the bosons i and i, the fermions are treated as
being local and hence their braiding relations are simply of the form:  = .
the equations (3.46)/(3.48) and (3.52) give the symmetry algebra of the theory (3.27) to lowest order in
perturbation theory. in fact, this algebra is the q-deformation of the the untwisted ane lie superalgebra
osp(2|2)(1), denoted uq [osp(2|2)(1)], with zero center. the only relations missing above are the serre relations
for uq [osp(2|2)(1)]. a review of the quantum algebra uq [osp(2|2)(1)], or quantum group as it is often called,
is presented in the appendix. let ei, fi, hi, i = 0, 1, 2, be the chevalley generators of uq [osp(2|2)(1)]. using
the dening relations (a.9) and (a.10), one can show that the generators satisfy

(cid:16)eiqhi/2(cid:17)(cid:16)fjqhj /2(cid:17)  (1)d(ei)d(fj)qaij(cid:16)fjqhj /2(cid:17)(cid:16)eiqhi/2(cid:17) = ij

(1  q2)(cid:0)1  q2hi(cid:1) ,

(3.53)

where aij  i  j is the generalized osp(2|2)(1) cartan matrix. comparing (3.53) with (3.46) or (3.48), and
the commutation relations (a.9a),(a.9b) with (3.52), we can relate the non-local charges to the quantum
group generators in two dierent ways. the rst set of relations, which follow from considering (3.46) and
taking q = q1, are

qi = cieiqhi/2 (di = d(ei)), qi = cifiqhi/2 (di = d(fi)), t i = hi ( di = d(hi)),

(3.54)

where the cis satisfy

i = (1)
c2

i

g2
2i

q1qaii/2(1  q2).

the second set, obtained from (3.48) and setting q = q2, gives

qi = cieiqhi/2 (di = d(ei)), qi = cifiqhi/2 (di = d(fi)),

t i = hi ( di = d(hi)),

with

(we have not yet shown (q1,2)2 = (q1,2)2 = 0, corresponding to the dening relation (a.9d). that this
holds can be veried from the explicit expressions in the fundamental representation discussed below.) from
now on we will work with the second set (3.56) and take the deformation parameter q to be

q = exp(i/ 2) =  exp(i/).

(3.58)

equation (3.58) gives the relationship between the beta parameter  and the quantum group deformation
parameter q mentioned earlier. the marginal point (  = 1) corresponds to q = 1.

i

some important remarks regarding the relationship between the models (2.18) and (3.27) and the quan-
tum group symmetry need to be made. for  > 1, the model (3.27) has quantum group symmetry. at the
marginal point (3.27) becomes (2.18) which, when fully renormalized, has yangian symmetry rather than
quantum group symmetry. this means that by carefully taking the marginal limit   1 of the algebra
(3.48), the yangian symmetry algebra can be extracted. or at the level of s -matrices, an s -matrix that
is symmetric under (3.38) and (3.45) (or (3.56)) should in the marginal limit give the yangian symmetric
, t i} as generating a symmetry of (3.27) for  > 1,
s -matrix of (2.3). so we can consider the charges {qi, q
with the understanding that for the system (2.3) the limit   1 needs to be taken. the symmetry structure
here is similar to that of the ane sl(n) toda model, and specically to that of the sine-gordon model,
which has uq(sl(2)(1)) symmetry for any  < 2 and this reduces to a yangian symmetry as   2 [34].

we have obtained this symmetry algebra as a lowest order result. showing that the algebra is exact to all
orders in perturbation theory amounts to giving a scaling argument that forbids any higher order terms
in g on the right side of (3.44) [34, 39]. we do not discuss exactness here since the lowest order result is
sucient to obtain the s -matrix. this is because the constraints on s placed by (i) the lowest order quan-
tum group/yangian symmetry and (ii) the scattering constraints of yang-baxter, unitarity and crossing,
are restrictive enough so that higher order contributions (if any) should only be of the cdd type. in this
sense the s -matrix we calculate is a minimal s -matrix. lastly, in the marginal limit it may seem that the
charges (3.56) blow up since   +. to resolve this one can regularize the limit by also taking g  0
such that lim 1(g) is nite. the sine-gordon charges also need to be regularized in the marginal limit.
another model which displays this behavior is the multi-cosine model (see [42] and references therein).

3d. the fundamental elds and the comultiplication

in this section we construct the quantum elds that create the particles in the fundamental vector
representation. we also determine the comultiplication of the quantum charges, that is, the action of the
charges on asymptotic multiparticle states. for completeness, we begin with a brief review of the fundamental
vector representation (see [4347] for further details).

the fundamental vector representation v of osp(2|2) (denoted (0, 1/2) in [43]) is four dimensional with a
basis {|1i,|2i,|3i,|4i}. (we will use the same symbol for the representation and the associated vector space.)
since we are dealing with a lie superalgebra, the vector space is z2-graded and the states can be assigned
parities, d(i), in two dierent ways: (i) |1i and |4i are even, d(1) = d(4) = 0, and |2i and |3i are odd,
d(2) = d(3) = 1; or (ii) |1i and |4i are odd, d(1) = d(4) = 1, and |2i and |3i are even, d(2) = d(3) = 0. we
take a simple root system {1, 2} that is purely fermionic. then the chevalley generators {ev
i }i=1,2

where {,} denotes the anticommutator. with an abuse of notation, the anized representation on the loop
space v  c[x, x1] will also be denoted by v .
considering next the quantum algebras, the osp(2|2) fundamental vector representation v is undeformed
as a representation of uq [osp(2|2)]. the generators of uq [osp(2|2)] satisfying the relations (a.9) have the
same matrix representations as above. as in the classical case, v is also anizable at the quantum level.
however for the quantum ane algebra, the even non-cartan generators are not given by (3.61a) but are
deformed to

 [iev

(3.65)

thus recovering the classical ane relation. henceforth we drop the q subscript from (3.62) since it will be
either clear from the context or explicitly stated whether we are dealing with the quantum or classical case.
the uq [osp(2|2)] representation (3.59) is referred to as being typical and type 1 or 2 grade star. an
irreducible representation v is said to be typical if any reducible representation w that contains v can
always be written as the direct sum w = w  v , for some other representation w . a representation
that is not typical is said to be atypical. an atypical representation will occur in the decomposition of
v  v below. the label type 1 or type 2 grade star indicates how the representation matrices behave under
hermitian conjugation [46]. a type 1 grade star representation has it generators satisfying

i ) = (1)d(f v
(ev
i ) = (1)d(ev
(f v
i ) = (hv

(hv

i )d()(f v

i )

i )d()(ev

i )

i ),

(3.66)

where the overbar means complex conjugation and the subscripts ,  denote matrix elements. for a type 2
grade star representation we have

i ) = (1)d(f v
(ev
i ) = (1)d(ev
(f v

i )d()(f v

i )

i )d()(ev

i )

14

(hv

i ) = (hv

i ).

(3.67)

if the parities are chosen to be d(1) = d(4) = 0 and d(2) = d(3) = 0, then (3.59) is of type 2 grade star,
whereas for the second choice d(1) = d(4) = 1 and d(2) = d(3) = 0, (3.59) becomes type 1 grade star.

we now want to construct the elds which will asymptotically create the states/particles for the funda-
mental vector representation. the topological charges of these elds must agree with (3.60). recall that the
independent topological charges are (t 1, t 2) = (h1, h2). furthermore, under the action of the charges the
elds must transform in a manner consistent with (3.59),(3.61b) and (3.62). this ensures that the states
will form a representation of the algebra (a.9). specically the charges should take the form

when acting on the elds.

(3.68a)

(3.68b)

in general, the elds will consist of vertex operators multiplied by some functions {fi, f i} of the fermions

i = exp(cid:18) i



i  ~(cid:19) fi(, ), i = exp(cid:18)

i


i  ~(cid:19) f i(, ),

(3.69)

where the is are the weights of the representation. both sets {i} and {i} have the same topological
charges. any set of elds diering from (3.69) by some local operators, such as

 = ei~,

(3.70)

will have the same topological charges. this means that (3.68) should be viewed as modulo any local
elds. thus knowing the topological charges, we can look for two sets of elds, which will generate all other
topologically equivalent families. we nd the following fundamental elds giving the correct charges

and

2(x, t) = exp(cid:18) i

1(x, t) = exp(cid:18) i

(3.73)

the topological charges can be found using (3.50) and agree with (3.60). therefore the elds (3.71) and
(3.72) can be taken to produce the states |iii=1,...,4 asymptotically (t  )

where  is the rapidity parameterizing the energy-momentum (m is the mass)

|i, i = i|0i,

|i, i = i|0i,

e = m cosh , p = m sinh .

(3.74)

(3.75)

since the theory (3.27) is in a massive phase, the states (3.74) are massive particle states with the dispersion
relation e2 = p 2+m2. one needs to check that the elds transform according to (3.68). that the topological
charges are correct conrms (3.68b). using the same procedure as in the previous section, we obtain for the
non-local charges acting on the elds

qi (j) = (2)

qi(j) = (2)

(3.77)

i , f v

and {ev
i }i=0,1,2 are given by (3.59) and (3.61). from (3.76) we see that (3.68) holds. note that the
deformed factorsp[2]q are not obtained for the action of q0 and q0. this is not problematic since overall
factors can be adjusted by redening the elds { ki, ki} without changing their particle creation properties.
lastly, all the elds have a non-trivial lorentz spin. the equations (3.76) should have a consistent spin
structure, namely if (ev

i )kj is non-zero, then the spins must satisfy

i )kj or (f v

s(qi ) + s(j) = s( ki),

s(qi) + s(j) = s( ki).

(3.78)

these relations are easily veried. the lorentz spins of the charges (3.39) are encoded by the on-shell
operators es. taking into account all the above results, the charges acting in the fundamental representation,
with states generated asymptotically by the elds (3.71) and (3.72), are given by

exp(2

corresponds to the homogeneous gradation (not to be confused with the even/odd parity gradation). for
(qi), i = 0, 1, 2, becomes exp(2/3)
a non-zero background charge q (3.31), the  dependence for q
(exp(+2/3)). this corresponds to the principal gradation. the two gradations are related by an inner
automorphism. given an element a()  uq [osp(2|2)(1)] in the homogeneous gradation, denoted ahomo.(),
the associated element in the principal gradation, aprinc.(), can be obtained from the transformation

where  = exp(hv
the action of the charges on multi-particle states is given by the comultiplication. a non-trivial comulti-
plication arises due to the non-locality of the charges and fundamental elds. as in (3.43), the non-locality
leads to non-trivial braiding between the currents and the elds. we nd the braiding relations

j i(x, t)j(y, t) = (1)did(j)qt i(j )j(y, t)j i(x, t)
j i(x, t)j (y, t) = (1)did(j)qt i(j )j(y, t)j i (x, t)
h i(x, t)j(y, t) = (1)did(j)qt i(j )j(y, t)h i(x, t)
h i (x, t)j(y, t) = (1)did(j)qt i(j )j(y, t)h i (x, t).

(3.81)
here d(i) gives the parity of the elds i and i, and hence of the state |ii: d(i) = d(i) = d(i). (since
1,4 (or 1,4) contain a single fermion, we could assign the parities d(1) = d(4) = 1 and d(2) = d(3) = 0.
however we will not make any specic choice and treat both cases (i) and (ii) above consecutively.) it follows
from (3.81) that the comultiplication is

(qi ) = qi  1 + qhi  qi
(qi) = qi  1 + qhi  qi
(hi) = hi  1 + 1  hi.

(3.82)
the expression for (hi) is a consequence of the topological charge t i being additive. the comultiplication
should be understood as being implicitly graded, via the product denition

(a  b)(a  b) = (1)d(b)d(a)aa  bb,

(3.83)

for charges a, b and states/elds a, b. this denition will be taken to hold for all quantities with denite
parities and where the products/actions aa and ba makes sense. since the comultiplication preserves the
algebra, it provides a representation of (3.56) on multi-particle states. by dening a counit and an antipode,
the quantum algebra uq [osp(2|2)(1)] can be given the structure of a hopf algebra [4951]. we will only need
the antipode (see section 4d), along with the comultiplication, to derive the s -matrix and hence avoid any
further discussion of this additional algebraic structure.

4. the s -matrix

4a. dening the s -matrix

given a theory with quantum ane symmetry uq (g) [52], the one-particle states can be arranged into sets,
or multiplets, transforming according to the irreducible representations of uq (g). each typical representation
can be uniquely labeled by the eigenvalues of the various casimir operators in the theory. specically, all
particles in a given multiplet have the same mass. quantum group (or yangian) symmetry ensures that
there exists an innite set of conserved higher-spin charges in involution, implying quantum integrability
of the system. any scattering process is strongly constrained by these conservation laws. a general multi-
particle scattering event factorizes into a series of two-particle processes, with the set of incoming momenta
and masses being equal to the set of outgoing momenta and masses. this means that the rapidities cannot
change and that only particles belonging to the same representation can transform into one another.

consider two multiplets, {|ii}i=1,...,m and {|ji}j=1,...,n, forming a basis for two representations of
uq (g), v and v respectively. an asymptotic incoming two-particle state, with rapidities 1 and 2, can be
represented as

where we take 1 > 2 and the notation implies a spacial ordering, i.e., the particles appear in space arranged
from left to right with decreasing rapidities. the state (4.1) will scatter into some asymptotic outgoing state
which, due to the above restrictions, will be of the form

|i, 1i  |j, 2i,

(4.1)

|k, 2i  |l, 1i.

17

(4.2)

the outgoing states will necessarily be spacially arranged from left to right with increasing rapidities. the
two-particle s -matrix is an operator, depending on the rapidities and the deformation parameter q (or ),
which relates the incoming state (4.1) to the outgoing state (4.2)

s(1, 2; q) : v  v  v  v

|i, 1i  |j, 2i =xk,l

[s(1, 2; q)]kl

ij |k, 2i  |l, 1i.

the matrix element [s(1, 2; q)]kl

ij gives the two particle scattering amplitude for the process

|i, 1i  |j, 2i  |k, 2i  |l, 1i.

lorentz invariance requires that s(1, 2; q) only depends on the combination   1  2

s(1, 2; q) = s(; q).

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

since we are interested in the fundamental vector representation, v = v = v , and we will drop the , 
indices.

the s -matrix has to satisfy certain constraints. factorized scattering requires that s (; q) be a solution of
the yang-baxter equation [13, 7, 53]. this xes s (; q) up to an overall scalar constant, which can be found
by imposing the crossing and unitarity conditions [7, 53]. the resulting s -matrix, known as the minimal
s -matrix, is ambiguous only up to cdd factors. lastly, applying the bootstrap program xes the cdd
factors thus giving the complete s -matrix [5355]. we will calculate the beta dependent minimal s -matrix
for the fundamental vector representation, leaving the bootstrap analysis for a future problem. the marginal
s -matrix will then be obtained in the limit   1.
4b.the yang-baxter equation and r-matrices

the quantum charges (3.56) generate a symmetry of the theory. therefore the action of the s -matrix

must commute with the action, or comultiplication, of the charges

for the fundamental representation (3.79), these commutation relations take the explicit form

[s, (qi )] = [s, (qi)] = [s, (hi)] = 0.

the comultiplication (4.12) is the standard comultiplication for the chevalley generators of uq [osp(2|2)(1)].
for the ane generators, e0 and f0, the comultiplication corresponds to the representation e0 = xi0ev

f0 = x1

equation (4.11) is precisely one of the dening relations for the uq [osp(2|2)(1)] r-matrix r(x; q) in the

and satises the intertwining property [51]

where all quantities are evaluated in the appropriate representation as indicated by the ,  indices. one can
also view r(x) as the spectral parameter dependent r-matrix of uq [osp(2|2)]. this equivalence follows
from the fact that for anizable representations, both the uq [osp(2|2)(1)] r-matrix (in the homogeneous
gradation) and the spectral parameter dependent r-matrix of uq [osp(2|2)] satisfy the same dening relation
(4.15). another r-matrix r(x; q), commonly referred to as the universal r-matrix, can be obtained from
r(x; q) by applying a permutation operation. dene the graded permutation operator p satisfying

p (|ui  |vi) = (1)d(u)d(v)|vi  |ui,

for any states |ui and |vi in v with denite parity. the universal r-matrix is related to r(x; q) by

r(x; q) = p r(x; q).

(4.16)

(4.17)

the universal r-matrix is known for various quantum ane superalgebras (see [51] and references therein).
for bosonic quantum groups, jimbo [4] showed that a solution to (4.15) is unique up to an overall
scalar function, and that any solution automatically satises the yang-baxter equation. these results were
extended to quantum supergroups by bracken et al. [50]. these authors showed that a non-trivial solution
of (4.11a) and (4.11b) must be even and is unique up to scalar factors. furthermore, this solution satises
(i) equations (4.11c)(4.11e) and (ii) the yang-baxter equation. the uniqueness of the solution implies that
s(x; q) takes the form

s(x; q) = v(x; q) r(x; q),

(4.18)

19

where the scalar function v(x; q) is xed by imposing the unitarity and crossing constraints (see section
4e) and by applying the bootstrap principle. thus for a theory with quantum group symmetry, the yang-
baxter equation need not be independently solved. rather factorization is a consequence of the intertwining
property (4.15) of the r-matrix.

the yang-baxter equations satised by the two r-matrices are

r12(x; q)r13(xy; q)r23(y; q) = r23(y; q)r13(xy; q)r12(x; q)

r23(x; q) r12(xy; q) r23(y; q) = r12(y; q) r23(xy; q) r12(x; q).

both equations act on v  v  v and for a solution r =pi ai  bi, the notation rij means

r12 =xi

ai  bi  1, r13 =xi

ai  1  bi, r23 =xi

1  ai  bi,

(4.19)

(4.20)

(4.21)

and similarly for rij. the yang-baxter equation for r(x; q) is implicitly graded due to the multiplication
rule (3.83). in components (4.19) takes the form (summing over repeated indices)

r(x; q)b1b2

a1a2(1)d(b2)d(b3)+d(b1)d(c3)+d(c1)d(c2).

(4.22)

the r-matrix r(x; q)b1b2
ponent form of (4.20) can be obtained from (4.22) by setting

a1a2  r(x; q)b1b2

a1a2(1)d(b1)d(b2) satises the ordinary yang-baxter equation. the com-

r(x; q)b1b2

a1a2 = r(x; q)b2b1

a1a2(1)d(b1)d(b2),

(4.23)

which does not contain any parity factors. of course the s -matrix also satises (4.20).
4c. the uq [osp(2|2)(1)] r-matrix r(x; q)
a solution to (4.11)/(4.15) has been previously computed in [56, 57] and [58]. in [56] r(x; q) was con-
structed for a set of four-dimensional typical representations characterized by a continuous parameter b.
this set includes the fundamental vector representation. we will re-derive r(x; q) using the method of [57]
and including some of the details omitted in these references. our conventions are also slightly dierent. we
hope a more explicit construction of r(x; q), showing the various steps involved, will be useful.

as discussed above, it is sucient to solve the following reduced set of equations

[ r(x; q), (ev

1,2)] = 0

r(x; q)(cid:16)xev

0  qhv

0 /2 + qh0/2  ev

0  qhv

0 /2 + qh0/2  xev

0(cid:17) =(cid:16)ev

0(cid:17) r(x; q).

however it is equally as manageable, and perhaps more illustrative, to work with the set

r(x; q)(cid:16)xev

0  qhv

[ r(x; q), (a)] = 0, a  uq[osp(2|2)]
0 /2 + qh0/2  ev

0  qhv

0(cid:17) =(cid:16)ev

0 /2 + qh0/2  xev

0(cid:17) r(x; q),

which obviously includes (4.24). thus we will seek a solution to (4.25).

into uq [osp(2|2)] invariant spaces v. since r(x; q) commutes with the uq [osp(2|2)] comultiplication, a
solution of (4.25a) can be written as

r(x; q) =x

(x; q)p 

 (q),

20

(4.27)

where p 
 (q) are projectors onto v and (x; q) are arbitrary functions. if the decomposition (4.26) is
completely reducible, then (4.27) is the most general solution of (4.25a). if instead the decomposition is not
fully reducible, then (4.27) need not be the most general solution, though it certainly is one solution.

returning to the fundamental representation, we look for a decomposition of v  v into uq [osp(2|2)]
invariant spaces. in the classical case, the tensor product is not completely reducible. one nds a decompo-
sition into two eight-dimensional invariant spaces [43]

here and henceforth the upper (lower) sign is to be taken if the parities are chosen to be even (odd) for |1i,

one expects that the basic structure of the decomposition will be the same, namely the tensor product is not

where wq is an irreducible invariant space going over to w as q  1, and wq is not irreducible, but contains
an invariant singlet state and goes over to w as q  1. a mechanical way to determine a basis for, say wq,
is to start with one of the states |
i i  w , or some deformed version of it. acting on this state with the
uq [osp(2|2)] generators will result in some new deformed states. one keeps repeating the process, acting on
every new state with (a) until an invariant set with the required properties is obtained. the success of this
procedure depends on the choice of the initial state. starting with the undeformed states |1i  |1i, |2i  |2i
and |3i  |3i, almost all the basis states of wq and wq can be obtained this way. the exception is the cyclic
state of wq which has to be independently constructed. we nd the following set spanning wq

the parity factor in (4.38) is introduced to cancel that of (3.83), so that the norm is positive

(4.40)
to determine r(x; q) we need to know the projectors for wq and wq, denoted p1(q) and p0(q) respectively.
if the states were all orthonormal, then p1(q) and p0(q) would have the usual form: pi |

(4.47)

a particular solution for r(x; q) satisfying (4.25a) is now given by

recalling our previous comments, since the decomposition (4.32) is not completely reducible, (4.48) is

not necessarily the most general solution. in particular, the operator

r0(x; q) = 1(x; q)p1(q) + 0(x; q)p0(q).

(4.48)

pn (q) = |

12ih 
13|,

(4.49)

mapping the cyclic vector onto the singlet state, can be added to (4.48). that this does not spoil (4.25a)
follows from (iv) and (v) above, which imply
(a)pn (q)|

i i = pn (q)(a)|

i i = 0, i.

(4.50)

some useful properties of pn (q) are

pn (q)2 = 0, p1(q)pn (q) = pn (q)p1(q) = 0, p0(q)pn (q) = pn (q)p0(q) = pn (q),

(4.51)

23

with the rst expressing the order 2 nilpotency of pn (q). thus the most general solution of (4.25a) is

r(x; q) = 1(x; q)p1(q) + 0(x; q)p0(q) + n (x; q)pn (q),

(4.52)

where the i(x; q)s are at present arbitrary functions soon to be xed by imposing (4.25b).

before calculating these functions, we give the explicit expressions for the projectors and pn (q) in the

original basis {|ii  |ji; i, j = 1, . . . , 4}. we choose to order the basis as

(v11, v22, v33, v44, v12, v21, v13, v31, v24, v42, v34, v43, v14, v23, v32, v41),

where

(4.53)

(4.54)

dene v as the column vector associated with (4.53), i.e., v1 = v11, v2 = v22, . . .. the basis states can be
written as

mij vj,

(4.55)

i i =xj
|

where the matrix mij can be obtained from (4.33) and (4.34). the metric and the inverse metric take the
form (t denotes transpose)

this gives the single projectors

g = m m t ,

g1 = (m 1)t m 1.

obviously, the corresponding r-matrices are also related by (4.68).

lastly, the i(x; q)s are determined from (4.25b), which we rewrite below

(cid:16)1(x; q)p1(q) + 0(x; q)p0(q) + n (x; q)pn (q)(cid:17)(cid:16)xev

0(cid:17)(cid:16)1(x; q)p1(q) + 0(x; q)p0(q) + n (x; q)pn (q)(cid:17)

multiplying this equation by p1(q) on the left and by pn (q) on the right, and with the help of (4.47) and
(4.51), gives

1(x; q) =(cid:18) x  q2

1  xq2(cid:19) 0(x; q).

25

to solve for n (x; q) we multiply (4.70) on the left by p1(q) and on the right by p0(q) to get

1(x; q)p1(q)(cid:16)xev

note that in calculating 1,n (x; q), the normalization of ev
needed. the complete r-matrix satisfying (4.25) is therefore (setting 0(x; q) = 1)

0 is irrelevant, and only the fact that ev

0  e41 is

r(x; q) = p0(q) +(cid:18) x  q2

p1 + q4

1  x2

(x  q2)(1  xq2)pn (q),

and is unique up to multiplication by a scalar factor. one can easily show that

r(1; q) = 1,

r(x; q) r(x1; q) = 1,

where the latter relation is the unitarity requirement. as stated above, the r-matrix for uq [osp(2|2)(1)]
has been previously computed in [56, 57] and [58]. our solution agrees with that of [56], where the same
uq [osp(2|2)] simple root system is used. to obtain (4.75) from the more general result presented in [56] (in
the limit b  0), one needs to take x  x1 and q  q1 due to the dierent conventions used.
4d. crossing symmetry

to go from the r-matrix (4.75) to a physical s -matrix we need to calculate the overall scalar factor

v(x; q). this factor is necessary in order to make s(x; q) crossing symmetric.

as it stands, (4.75) satises the yang-baxter and unitarity requirements. we have seen that these two
conditions follow from the intertwining property of r(x; q) with the comultiplication . in a similar manner,
crossing symmetry arises due to an additional intertwining property of the universal r-matrix r(x; q) with
the antipode operation s. with this additional property the r-matrix also becomes crossing symmetric,
which allows us to identify r(x; q) with the s -matrix. in terms of the notation (4.18), this means absorbing
the scalar factor into r(x; q), v(x; q) r(x; q)  r(x; q), setting s(x; q) = r(x; q) = p r(x; q), and requiring
this new r-matrix to satisfy the crossing constraint (4.92) along with (4.25). in the general discussion below,
we will make this change taking s(x; q) = r(x; q). we begin by reviewing the antipode operation. from its
relation to the universal r-matrix we will then derive the crossing symmetry constraint. (for further details
the reader is referred to [52].)

the antipode is one of the dening structures of a hopf algebra which acts to connect the multiplication
and comultiplication operations. for a non-ane quantum supergroup uq(g), the antipode s is dened by
its action on the generators as follows [49] (i = 1, 2, . . . , r)

v (s(ei)) = qii/2v (ei)
v (s(fi)) = q+ii/2v (fi)

(4.77)
where the notation v ( ) means all quantities are taken in the representation v . (in the notation of section
3d, v (ei) = ev

v (s(hi)) = v (hi),

i , etc..) for q = 1 this reduces to the classical antipode scl
v (scl(a)) = v (a), a  {ei, fi, hi}.

(4.78)

the antipode can be extended to a graded anti-automorphism, so that for homogeneous elements a and b
(i.e., elements with denite parity)

s(ab) = (1)d(a)d(b)s(b)s(a).

26

(4.79)

to build the crossing relation a concept of charge conjugation is required, whereby a particle is trans-
formed into its antiparticle. at the more formal level, the charge conjugation operation is expressed in terms
of a charge conjugation matrix. if there exists a matrix c satisfying

v (s(a)) = c 1 (v (a))st c, a  {ei, fi, hi},

then c is dened to be the charge conjugation matrix. in the classical case this becomes

here st denotes the supertranspose, which for homogeneous elements is given by

 v (a) = c 1 (v (a))st c, a  {ei, fi, hi}.

(v (a))st

 = (1)d()d()+d() (v (a)) .

(4.80)

(4.81)

(4.82)

for the uq [osp(2|2)] simple root system (3.21), we have 1  1 = 2  2 = 0, and one can show that in the
fundamental representation (3.59)

c =

1

1

1

1

 .

(4.83)

the signs refer to the two dierent parity assignments (see section 4c).

for an ane quantum supergroup uq(g), the antipode is still given by (4.77). however, in order to
correctly dene a charge conjugation matrix it is necessary to shift the spectral parameter. thus it is
convenient to explicitly display the  dependence (i = 0, 1, . . . , r)

v (s(ei)) = qii/2e+siv (ei)


v (s(fi)) = q+ii/2esiv (fi)


v (s(hi)) = v (hi).

(4.84)

here the notation 

v ( ) indicates the  dependence and si is the lorentz spin of ei, i.e.,

gives the anized representation of uq(g) on a loop algebra in some gradation (s0, s1, . . . , sr). the ev
and hv
gradation we are working with s0 = 2/, s1 = s2 = 0, giving

v (e0) = xev
0


v (e1,2) = ev

(x = e2/),

(4.86)

and so forth.

if (4.84) can now be written as





v (s(ei)) = e+(i+)sic 1 (v (ei))st c = c 1(cid:0)+i
v (s(fi)) = e(i+)sic 1 (v (fi))st c = c 1(cid:0)+i

(4.87)

for some matrix c, then this denes c to be the (ane) charge conjugation matrix. specializing to the
algebra uq [osp(2|2)(1)], we have

q = ei/

q11/2 = q22/2 = 1,

q00/2 = e2i/,

(4.88)

(4.89)

giving for (4.84)


v (s(e1,2)) = v (e1,2)

27


v (s(e0)) = e+(+i)(2/)v (e0)


v (s(f1,2)) = v (f1,2)


v (s(f0)) = e(+i)(2/)v (f0)


v (s(h0,1,2)) = v (h0,1,2).

(4.90)

comparing (4.90) with (4.87), we see that c has to satisfy (4.81) for all the ane generators. one can check
the same uq [osp(2|2)] conjugation matrix (4.83) also satises (4.81) for the fundamental ane representation
(3.59), (3.61b) and (3.62). (the fact that the charge conjugation matrix is the same for uq [osp(2|2)] and
uq [osp(2|2)(1)] is a consequence of the specic representation, gradation and root system we are working
with. in general this is not the case.)
the crossing relation can now be derived from the following relation between the universal r-matrix and

the antipode

evaluating this in the representation 1

(s  1)r = r1.
v , and making use of (4.87) one gets ( = 1  2)

v  2

r(; )(c 1  1)(r(i + ; ))st1 (c  1) = 1,

(4.91)

(4.92)

where st1 means taking the supertranspose in only the rst space of the tensor product v v . in components
we have
(4.93)

.

= (1)d(a1)d(b1)+d(a1)ra1b2

b1a2

we also have written (; ) instead of (x; q) for the variable dependence of r and will freely use both
notations. equation (4.92) is easily derived using the general expression for r obtained via the quantum
double construction [59, 60]

(4.94)

(4.95)

(4.96)

(4.97)

substituting s(; ) = p r(; ) into (4.92) gives the crossing relation for the s -matrix

p s(; )(c 1  1)(p s(i + ; ))st1 (c  1) = 1.

with the unitarity condition

equation (4.95) can be rewritten as

s(; )s(; ) = 1,

s(; ) = (c 1  1)(p s(i  ; ))st1 (c  1)p.

we have derived (4.97) rather formally, though its physical interpretation is simple: the amplitude for the
direct-channel process

is the same as the amplitude for the cross-channel process

|a1, 1i  |a2, 2i  |b2, 2i  |b1, 1i,

|a2, 2 + i/2i  |b1, 1  i/2i  |a1, 1  i/2i  |b2, 2 + i/2i,

where the overbar denotes the conjugated state as determined by the charge conjugation matrix.

(4.98)

(4.99)

4e. the minimal s -matrix

we now want to build a crossing symmetric s -matrix starting from the previously obtained result

s(x; q) = v(x; q) r(x; q) = v(x; q)p r(x; q).

(4.100)

here we have returned to to the notation of section 4c, with r(x; q) being the specic solution (4.75) and not
the crossing symmetric r-matrix satisfying (4.92). in general, a solution for v(x; q) making s(x; q) crossing
symmetric will spoil unitarity. (recall r(x; q) is unitary (4.76).) thus the crossing and unitarity equations
need to be considered together when determining v(x; q).

28

the constraints (4.96) and (4.95) give the following equations for v(x; q)

v(x; q)v(x1; q) = 1

where we have used

v(x; q)v(xq2; q)(cid:2)r(x; q)(c 1  1)(r(xq2; q))st1 (c  1)(cid:3) = 1,

x() = e2/,

x(i + ) = x()q2.

evaluating the quantity in square brackets, [. . .], we get

[. . .] =

(x  q2)
(x  1)

(1  xq2)
(1  xq4)

,

for both parity assignments. therefore the functional relations determining the scalar factor are

v(x; q)v(x1; q) = 1

v(x; q)v(xq2; q) =

(x  1)
(x  q2)

(1  xq4)
(1  xq2)

.

we choose to express these equations in a slightly dierent form. introduce v(x; q) via

v(x; q) =

1
42

1
xq2 (x  q2)(1  xq2)v(x; q).

then (4.105a) and (4.105b) are equivalent to

v(x; q)v(x1; q) =

(42q2)2

(1  xq2)2(1  x1q2)2

v(x1q2; q) = v(x; q),

or in terms of (, )

v(; )v(; ) =

(4.106)

(4.107)

(4.107b)

(4.108a)

(4.108b)

a solution to these equations can be constructed iteratively as discussed in [25, 34]. one begins with a
specic solution of (4.108a), call it v0. this will in general not be a solution of (4.108b). one then looks
for a solution of (4.108b), denoted v1, that is of the form v1 = v0f1 for some function f1. now v1 will no
longer satisfy (4.108a) and one has to re-construct a unitary solution. in order not to end up with the prior
solution v0, a new solution v2, of the form v2 = v1f2 = v0f1f2, is sought. the process is then repeated,

eventually giving a solution in the form of an innite product v = v0qi fi (assuming everything converges).

this recursive method will become clear as we solve (4.108). the nal solution for v will depend on the
choice of v0. this reects the fact that (4.108) does not have a unique solution. however all solutions will
dier only by a product (possibly innite) of cdd factors. for a certain choice of v0 the solution will be
minimal, meaning that it will contain a minimum number of poles in the physical strip 0 < im  < . we
will build this minimal solution.

in constructing a minimal solution it is more convenient, and perhaps even necessary, to work with (4.108)

rewritten in terms of gamma functions as

v(; )v(; ) =(cid:18)(cid:18)1

v(i  ; ) = v(; ).

29

(4.109a)

(4.109b)

for an initial solution of (4.109a) we take

v0(; ) = (cid:18)(cid:18)1 

1


(1 +

i


)(cid:19) (cid:18) 1



(1 

i


)(cid:19)(cid:19)2

.

however, this does not solve (4.109b). so we adjust (4.110) as follows

where

v1(; ) = v0(; )f1(; ),

f1(; ) = v0(i  ; ).

(4.110)

(4.111)

(4.112)

now v1(; ) is crossing symmetric but spoils the unitarity constraint. unitarity is restored by taking

v2(; ) = v0(; )f1(; )f2(; )

where

f2(; ) =

1

.

f1(; )

at the next step we have, restoring crossing symmetry,

where

v3(; ) = v0(; )f1(; )f2(; )f3(; )

f3(; ) = f2(i  ; ),

and so forth, with the process never terminating. from the structure of the vis, we see that the complete
solution to (4.109) takes the form

v(; ) = v0(; )

yn=1

v0((2n  1) i  ; )
v0((2n  1) i + ; )

therefore, the minimal s -matrix for the toda model (3.27) is

s(; ) = v(; ) r(; ),

(4.122)

with r(; ) given by (4.75) and v(; ) as above. the s -matrix is unique up to an arbitrariness only of
the cdd type. as previously stated, the cdd factors are determined by applying the bootstrap procedure.
in general this is a complicated task and requires knowing all the particle multiplets of the theory. the
bootstrap equation constrains the poles and zeros of the various s -matrices associated with the dierent
multiplets. the nal result is that the complete s -matrix (for the vector representation) takes the form

scomplete(; ) = x(; )v(; ) r(; ),

(4.123)

where x(; ) is a product of cdd type factors.

these expressions are useful for analyzing the pole structure of s(; ) (see section 5).
4f. the yangian limit and the osp(2|2) current-current s -matrix

in this section we compute the yangian symmetric s -matrix, sy (), for the original osp(2|2) current-
current model (2.3). as explained in section 2, sy () can be obtained from (4.122) by taking the marginal
limit   1+, or   0+ where   1/. (this limit is equivalent to the rational limit usually considered for
r-matrices, and the resulting r-matrix being referred to as the rational r-matrix.)
the marginal limit is easily evaluated for the various components of s(; ). for the projectors, which
are well dened as   0+, we simply set q = 1. for the remaining factors, v(; ) and 1,n (; ), we make
use of

these results could have been obtained directly from (4.72) and (4.74), and by taking the marginal limit
before calculating v(). combining everything, sy () takes the block diagonal form as in (4.61) with the
individual blocks being:

this completes our calculation of the s -matrix for the osp(2|2) current-current model (2.3).
we have not yet proven that (4.130) is yangian symmetric. this means showing sy () commutes
with the comultiplication of the yangian generators. unfortunately the general theory of super yangians
associated with lie superalgebras is not as fully developed as that of quantum supergroups. (see [61, 62]
and references therein for a discussion of super yangians.) for ordinary lie algebras, one can realize a
yangian structure in terms of non-local charges arising from curvature-free currents [36]. this construction
is particularly useful is studying yangian symmetric eld theories and s -matrices. however we are unaware
of a similar characterization of the yangians for lie superalgebras. thus we do not strictly show (4.130) to
be yangian symmetric but give some supporting evidence. our discussion is based on a comparison with
bosonic yangian symmetric systems. examples of such systems include gross-neveu type models and the
sine-gordon model. at the marginal point, these models consist of current-current type perturbations of a
free eld theory. furthermore, their yangian symmetric s -matrices can be obtained by taking the marginal
limit of a s -matrix with ane quantum group symmetry [34]. (for the gross-neveu model this quantum
group symmetric s -matrix corresponds to an ane toda theory.) the yangian symmetry of the s -matrix,
i.e., the vanishing commutator of s with the yangian comultiplication, follows from the marginal limit of
the quantum ane symmetry relations. here we are dealing with a supersymmetric analog of the bosonic
gross-neveu model. the current-current model (2.3) is a gross-neveu type model based on osp(2|2), and
(2.18) is an osp(2|2)(1) toda-type system. as for the bosonic case, we expect that the marginal s -matrix is
yangian symmetric and the corresponding symmetry relations can be extracted from (4.11).
let us rst recall the bosonic situation. the yangian y (g) based on a semi-simple lie algebra g of rank
a }a=1,...,r satisfying, among others, the relations [36, 60, 63, 64]

(4.136)

for the bosonic su(n ) gross-neveu model, it was shown in [34] that (4.136) can be recovered by expanding
the ane quantum group symmetry relations in , with   0+ being the marginal limit. the zeroth order
term gives the constraint (4.136a) and the rst order term leads to (4.136b).
now we show that relations similar to (4.136) can also be obtained from (4.11) as   0+ ( = 1/).
(note that in writing (4.11) we had canceled the non-zero factors ci (3.57) from both sides. however as
  0+, ci seems to blow up. as explained earlier to make sense of (4.11) we need to regularize the charges
by taking g  0 such that g is nite.) we will only display the relations for the eis, with those for the other
generators treated similarly. the uq [osp(2|2)(1)] generators will be denoted as eiq, hiq and the -independent
osp(2|2)(1) generators as ei, hi. (we also drop the v superscript.) from (3.59), (3.61b) and (3.62) we have
to lowest order in 
(4.137)

e1,2q = e1,2,

hiq = hi

of course (4.137) is exact since these generators are not deformed. the i factor in (4.138) is a result of the
yangian point being q = 1 instead of q = 1. also the spectral parameters are

e0q = ie0  2 2

4

ie0.

(4.138)

xi0 = e2i  1  2i.

substituting these expressions into (4.11a) and (4.11b) we nd to zeroth order in 

sy ()(cid:16)ei  (1)hi/2 + (1)hi/2  ei(cid:17) =(cid:16)ei  (1)hi/2 + (1)hi/2  ei(cid:17) sy (),

to rst order in  we have

sy ()12(ei) = 21(ei)sy (),

(4.139)

(i = 0, 1, 2).

where

where si/ is the lorentz spin of the charge qi . even though the charges e(1)
are identically zero in this
representation, there is non-trivial structure due to the comultiplication (4.142) and (4.143). that the e(1)
s
vanish is not surprising since uq [osp(2|2)(1)] is not deformed to order . unlike (4.134), the  dependence of
t(e(1)
) is not the same for all generators, which reects the choice of gradation (homogeneous) and the root
structure of osp(2|2)(1). the twisting factors (1)hi/2 are again a consequence of the q  1 limit rather
than q  1. o shell, these factors correspond to a choice of statistical klein factors and are not expected
to be dynamical [60]. (taking q  1 gives an equivalent crossing symmetric s -matrix, with the same charge
conjugation properties and diering from (4.130) only by a similarity transformation.) the s -matrix (4.130)
therefore satises symmetry relations analogous to those of (bosonic) yangian symmetric s -matrices, which
supports the claim that sy () has super yangian symmetry.

5. the analytic structure of s(; )

we have argued that in the marginal limit the toda s -matrix s(; ) gives the minimal s -matrix for the
osp(2|2) current-current model (2.3) (in the fundamental vector representation). as   1, the toda theory
renormalizes to the current-current model and s(; ) reduces to sy (). we now study the pole structure
of s(; ).

in the above calculation of s(; ) we have taken  to lie in the range 1   < , which restricts 1/ to
(5.1)

< 1.

1


0 

for these values the s -matrix does not have any poles in the physical strip 0 < im  < . in particular,
the physical s -matrix sy () does not contain any bound states. this structure is identical to that of the

sine-gordon s -matrix for the range 8   <  or 1 < 8/  0, with 8/ = 0 being the yangian

point (though in this range the sine-gordon model is not well-dened [7]). of course s(; ) satises the
scattering constraints for all values of 1/ and we made no direct use of (5.1) in deriving s(; ). for the
sine-gordon model the physically relevant parameter range is 8/ > 0. analogously, we will consider
the range 1/ > 1. this necessarily means ignoring the relation (3.36) and treating  as an independent
free parameter. thus we are now viewing s(; ) as the fundamental s -matrix for some theory. (since
the quantum group symmetry used to derive s(; ) is valid only for the range (5.1), we cannot consider
s(; ) to be the s -matrix for the toda theory (3.27) for 1/ > 1. also if 1/ > 1, then (3.36) implies  is
purely imaginary, which leads to (g) = (g) < 0, i.e., the perturbation becomes irrelevant. even so, it is
interesting to study the pole structure of s(; ) independent of any lagrangian formulation.) for simplicity
we will restrict our analysis to generic values of  such that q 6= 1,i, i.e., we take 1/ > 1 with 1/ not
an integer or half-integer.
the -dependence is contained in the factors v(; ), 1(; ) and n (; ). from (4.119) one can check
in the remaining nite

that the innite product i(; ) contains no zeros or poles in the physical strip.

the (1) factor is due to the negative sign in the charge conjugation matrix and the bar denotes the

a corresponding pole in the cross-channel.

the amplitudes (vi)-(xii) correspond to transitions between states with zero topological charge, (t 1, t 2) =
(0, 0). simple poles in these amplitudes at  = i(m + 1) can be interpreted as charge neutral bound states
in the direct-channel. these are the breathers of the theory. the associated cross-channel poles occur
at  = i  i(m + 1) in (ii) - (iv). there are also bound states of charge (+2, 0), (2, 0), (0, +2) and
(0,2). these breathing solitons appear as simple poles in both the direct- and cross-channels in (v).
lastly, there are various double poles which probably have an explanation in terms of a coleman-thun type
mechanism [65].

6. conclusions

we have computed the s -matrix for a certain disordered system. after disorder averaging, the theory can be
written as a current-current perturbation of an osp(2|2) supersymmetric cft. this current-current model
is known to be yangian symmetric. instead of directly constructing the yangian symmetric s -matrix, we
followed the approach of [34]. this approach consisted of working with a toda-type theory which renormalizes
to the osp(2|2) current-current model at the marginal point. for the toda theory we built quantum group
charges satisfying the uq [osp(2|2)(1)] algebra. the hopf algebraic structure of uq [osp(2|2)(1)] was then used
to construct the exact s -matrix s(; ) (up to cdd factors) for the fundamental vector representation. we
argued that in the marginal limit this uq [osp(2|2)(1)] s -matrix reduces to the exact physical s -matrix sy ()
for the fundamental particles of the osp(2|2) current-current model. we did not prove that the quantum
group symmetry used to determine s(; ) and sy () is exact to all orders in g. nevertheless, the fact that
we were able to construct a s -matrix satisfying the scattering constraints and having a symmetry algebra
agreeing with the yangian is strong support for the validity of (4.130). as mentioned above, one can try to
construct the yangian charges and in turn determine sy () from the yangian symmetry. however, whereas

37

the procedure for computing s using quantum group symmetry is, in principle, well established, this is
not the case for the yangian symmetric situation. we hope to address this issue for the specic model
(2.3) in the future. another independent check of (4.130) will be to do a thermodynamic bethe ansatz
analysis [16, 18, 66, 67]. this is complicated by the fact that sy () is not diagonal.

the -dependent s -matrix s(; ) is itself an interesting result. for 0 < 1/ < 1, s(; ) is the s -matrix
for the supersymmetric toda system (3.27), and reduces to the rational result sy () at 1/ = 0. yet s(; )
satises all the scattering constraints for any 1/ > 0, which suggests that it is the fundamental soliton
s -matrix for some other theory (recall that for 1/ > 1 the toda perturbation (3.29) becomes irrelevant).
in the marginal limit this theory also ows to the osp(2|2) current-current model. it is an open question to
determine the theory, in the sense of an action, corresponding to (4.122) for all  (or ). this theory will
be some perturbation of the c = 0 cft (2.4). since s(; ) has a non-trivial pole structure, the complete
s -matrix must include the scattering amplitudes for the neutral and charged bound states. these amplitudes
can be found by applying the bootstrap principle.

appendix a

in this appendix we review the osp(2|2) superalgebras and give the relationship between the osp(2|2)(1)
generators and the currents (2.9),(2.10). our discussion omits the serre relations as they are not needed
in this paper. for the same reason, we will also dene the ane algebras without the derivation. further
details on general (ane) lie superalgebras and quantum supergroups, including osp(2|2), may be found
in [51, 6871]. we will follow most closely the notations and conventions of [51] and [69] (though unlike [51]
and [69], we take a simple root system for osp(2|2) that is purely fermionic).

cartan generators hi are even); and (ii) aij is the symmetric generalized cartan matrix dened as

aij = (i, j),

(a.3)

where ( ,) is a xed invariant bilinear form on the root space. in contrast with (bosonic) lie algebras,
superalgebras allow several inequivalent simple root systems. a common choice is the distinguished root
system, where all simple roots except one are taken to be bosonic. we will instead work with a purely
fermionic osp(2|2) simple root system with the parities
d1,2  d(e1,2) = d(f1,2) = 1,

d1,2  d(h1,2) = 0.

the untwisted ane lie superalgebra osp(2|2)(1) contains an additional root 0 = , where  is the

highest root of osp(2|2). explicitly we have

0 = (1 + 2) = (0,2i).

(a.7)

this additional root is necessarily even, with d0  d(e0) = d(f0) = 0. the ane generators {ei, fi, hi; i =
0, 1, 2} satisfy the same relations (a.1) as for osp(2|2). (if we included the derivation, 0 would be given by
  , where  is the minimal imaginary root of osp(2|2)(1). however, since  satises (, ) = (, 1,2) = 0,
the dening relations (a.1) are unchanged.) the ane cartan matrix is

note that in section 3 we nd h0 = (h1 + h2), thus there h0 is not an independent generator. this implies
that the central extension is zero. for a non-zero central extension all the cartan generators {h0, h1, h2}
satisfying (a.1) are independent.
(2) the quantum superalgebras uq [osp(2|2)] and uq [osp(2|2)(1)]
the quantum superalgebras (or supergroups) uq [osp(2|2)] and uq [osp(2|2)(1)] are deformations of the
universal enveloping algebras for osp(2|2) and osp(2|2)(1). as such they are (unital) z2-graded associative
algebras generated by {ei, fi, hi}, where i = 1, 2 for uq [osp(2|2)] and i = 0, 1, 2 for uq [osp(2|2)(1)], modulo

here q is an arbitrary non-zero complex number. in the limit q  1, (a.9) reduces to (a.1). the expressions

a thorough discussion of the representation theory for the osp(2|2) algebras can be found in [4347, 49].

(hi) = (ei) = (fi) = 0,

(1) = 1.

the super-currents (2.9) have laurent expansions of the form (concentrating only on the holomorphic

(3) the osp(2|2)(1) currents
sector)

the algebra satised by the modes {on} can be obtained using the opes (2.11) and the formula

to prove the equivalence between the current algebra and the level one osp(2|2)(1) algebra, we need to
show that (a.18) agrees with (a.1). this amounts to correctly identifying the modes with the generators
{ei, fi, hi; i = 0, 1, 2}. we nd the following relations (here (o)m  om)

e0 =

f0 =

k+1,

h0 = 1 + 2h0

1

2bk1,

e1 = i(g)0,

1
2

f1 = i(bg+)0,
f1 = i(bg)0,

(a.19)
note that h0 6= (h1 + h2), but rather h0 = k  (h1 + h2) where k = 1 is the level. this diers from the
quantum group charges (3.56) where the level, or central extension, is zero and t 0 = (t 1 + t 2). one can
check that (a.19) is consistent with (2.11) and (a.1).

e2 = i(g+)0,

in the cartan-weyl basis, the conserved currents for the conformal eld theory (2.4) are

h1 = (h0 + j0)
h2 = (h0  j0).

where the constant of proportionality depends on the particular representation. evaluating (a.21) using the
representation matrices (3.59) and (3.61) we get

str(cid:0)j j(cid:1) = 2(cid:20)jj  hh +

1
2

(kbk + bkk) + gbg+  bgg+ + g+bg  bg+g(cid:21) .

this is identical to (2.12) hence conrming that v is indeed a current-current perturbation.
