abstract

the zero-point energy of a massless fermion eld in the interior of two parallel plates in a d-

dimensional space-time at zero temperature is calculated.

in order to regularize the model, a

mix between dimensional and zeta-function regularization procedure is used and it is found that

the regularized zero-point energy density is nite for any number of space-time dimensions. we

present a general expression for the casimir energy for the fermionic eld in such a situation.

quantum chromodynamics (qcd) is a non-abelian gauge eld theory that describes the quark

dynamics. the non-observation of isolated quarks, i.e., the fact that only colorless states are

physically realized, introduced the concept of connement. the mechanism by which this occurs

is still unknown. the bag model is an attempt to conciliate the success of the quark model with

connement and its key point is the approximation that the bag is a classical spherical cavity

with quarks and gluons conned.

in a rst approximation, the quarks and gluons move freely

inside the bag, but are absolutely conned to its interior. since any quantum eld submitted to

classical boundary conditions gives rise to the casimir eect [1] , we expect that connement will

give rise to the casimir energy of the gluon and quark elds [2]. over the past twenty ve years

many authors calculated the renormalized zero-point energy of dierent quantum elds in the bag

model. the renormalized vacuum energy due to the scalar eld in the bag model was presented by

bender and hays [3] and more recently by romeo [4] and also bordag et al. [5]. the calculation

for the case of the gluon eld was presented by milton [2] and also romeo [6] and for the fermion

eld milton [2] and also bender and hays [3] obtained the casimir energy in the bag model.

in the renormalization problem, where we have to extract physically nite answers, two dierent

physical situations must be studied. the rst one is the case where the surface whereon the elds

satisfy some boundary conditions divides the manifold into two parts, and the elds are present

in both regions. the second one - the bag model case - is the case where the elds are conned

to the interior of some region, i.e., there is no eld outside [7]. in this second case, since there are

no exterior modes, if we use a cut-o or the greens function method to regularize the zero-point

1

energy, divergencies appear and we will be able to absorb them by means of a renormalization

procedure only if we introduce ad hoc contact terms. there are many attempts to solve this

problem, but to our knowledge, this question is still open in the literature. using the weyl theorem

[8] it it not dicult to show that the asymptotic eigenfrequency distribution of any quantum eld

conned in a nite volume will present divergent terms proportional to geometric parameters of

the region to which the eld is conned. to keep in mind the problem, let us consider it for the

case of the a scalar eld. (units in which h = c = 1 will be used throughout this letter. the

metric tensor is taken to be  = diag(1,1, ...,1).)

let us use the mode sum energy heimode

baacke and igarashi [9] investigate the structure of the divergencies of the regularized zero-

point energy of massive fermions conned in a spherical cavity, assuming the condition of zero

current across the surface. considering a massless fermionic eld inside and outside a spherical

shell, milton [2] showed that there was a cancellation of these divergencies.

it is clear that if

we consider fermions only in the interior of the shell, it is necessary to introduce contact terms

to deal with the divergencies of the regularized zero-point energy. thus a question arises: using

an analytical regularization procedure, is it possible to present a geometric conguration with

conned elds where the contact terms are not necessary?

our purpose is to compute the zero-point energy due to a free massless fermionic eld conned

in the interior of two parallel plates in any number of space-time dimensions. the same idea

was used by chodos and thorn [7], where the dirac eld is conned between two parallel plates

separated by a distance l in the z direction - a slab. we treat the number of dimensions as a

continuous parameter and to regularize the zero-point energy we will make use of dimensional

regularization in the continuous variables (related to the sides of the box with innite length) and

then we analytically extend the hurwitz zeta-function that appears after dimensional regulariza-

tion. as a consequence, we have been able to prove that the regularized zero-point energy density

is nite in any number of space-time dimensions. in other words, it is not necessary to introduce

counterterms in the bare lagrangian, i.e., we have a situation with regularization without renor-

malization. some comments are in order. the bag boundary conditions for spin-half elds in

rectangular cavities, that is, the assumption that the eld exists only inside some region, can be

3

implemented only if there is solely one direction of nite extension, because the presence of the

corners prevents solutions to the massless dirac equation for higher-dimensional hypercubes [10].

the situation for massive spinor elds is even worse, in that there is not a solution even in the

presence of only one direction of nite size [11].

consider an ultrastatic d-dimensional at manifold. the zero-point energy of the dirac eld

is:

d0| h|0e = c(d)z

ddp
(2)d p,

where c(d) is the number of dierent spin states in a d-dimensional space-time. c(d) = 2

for d even, and c(d) = 2

for odd d. in the above,

are the eigenfrequencies of the orthonormal modes, basis in the space of solutions of the free dirac

equation, i.e., these modes are positive frequency with respect to a timelike killing vector t.

we now turn to the calculation of the zero-point energy of the dirac eld in the d-dimensional

slab conguration, that is, in the presence of two parallel plates placed in the d-direction, at

positions xd = 0 and xd = l. the boundary condition that we will impose is that there is no

particle current through the walls, and consequently we will call this conguration the slab-bag.

in lorentz covariant form we have:

 = 0,

(5)

where  = (0, ~), ~ being the unit spatial vector normal to the surface and directed to the interior

4

of the slab. the boundary conditions are satised only if the allowed values for the momentum in

the d-direction are given by [12]

pd = pd(n, l) = (n +

the zero-point energy of the dirac eld in the slab-bag conguration, taking into account eqs.

(4) and (6), and also noting that the integrations over the momenta in eq. (3) for the present

conguration correspond to d  1 integrations and one summation, is given by:

d0| h|0e = c(d)

(7)

dening the total zero-point energy per unit area of the plates, that is, the vacuum energy density:

d = d0| h|0e

= d+1(l),

we arrive at:

d(l) =

.

the expression above is clearly divergent, both in the integration and in the summation variables.

to regularize it we will use dimensional regularization in the continuous variables and then analyt-

ically extend the hurwitz zeta-function that will appear after dimensional regularization. using

the well-known result of dimensional regularization, i.e.:

(10)

it is easy to show that the vacuum energy per unit area is given by:

d (l) =

c(d)(d1)/2

2d1ld1 (cid:18)1  d
2 (cid:19)



(n +

next we can dene f (d) = c(d)(d1)/2

2d1

, and note that:

(z, q) =

(n + q)z ,



xn=0

q 6= 0,1,2,3, ...

(11)

(12)

is the hurwitz zeta-function, which is analytic for re(z) > 1, in terms of which we can write the

vacuum energy density of the massless dirac eld in the slab-bag conguration as:

d(l) =

f (d)

ld1 (cid:18)1  d

2 (cid:19) (cid:18)1  d,

1

2(cid:19) .

(13)

the two cases, i.e., d even and d odd, are treated separately. we rst examine the case of

even-d. for even-d, the gamma-function presents no poles, and using the principle of analytic

continuation one can write that:

(m, v) = bm+1(v)

m + 1

, m = 1, 2, 3, ...

(14)

and also the relation between the bernoulli polynomials and bernoulli numbers: bd( 1

2 ) = (1 

21d)bd, to obtain the vacuum energy density:

d(l) = 

f (d)

ld1 (cid:18)1  d

2 (cid:19) (21d  1)

bd
d

f or d even.

(15)

as a conclusion, eq. (15) shows us that the regularized zero-point energy per unit area of massless

fermions in an even-dimensional slab-bag is free of divergencies. in particular, calculating the above

6

expression for d = 4, one nds the value:

4(l) = 

72
2880l3 ,

(16)

in accordance with [13].

in the case where d is odd, one begins with the duplication formula for the gamma functions:

then denes

(cid:18)

s

2(cid:19) =

g(d) =

(s),

 2s+1
(cid:16) 1s
2 (cid:17)
f (d) 2d
(cid:16) 2d
2 (cid:17)

,

in terms of which the vacuum energy density now reads:

d(l) =

g(d)

ld1 (1  d) (cid:18)1  d,

1

2(cid:19) .

(17)

(18)

(19)

let us now show that the zeta-function times the gamma-function in the equation above is a

meromorphic function in the whole complex plane. first we write the integral representation of

the hurwitz zeta-function:

(z, q) =

1

(z) z 

0

dt tz1 et(1q)
et  1

,

(20)

and we separate the range of integration as:

[0, 1) + [1,), in order to take advantage of the

expansion:

text
et  1

=



xn=0

bn(x)

n!

tn, 0 < |t| < 2.

(21)

7

the integral in the second range, i.e., [1,), is a regular function of z, because the integrand
diverges for small t only, and it will be denoted by

h1(z, q) = z 

1

dt tz1 et(1q)
et  1

.

integrating term by term in the rst range, and using eq. (22), we have that:

(z, q) =

1

(z) "h1(z, q) +



xn=0

(1)nbn(q)

n!

1

z + n  1# ,

(22)

(23)

where we have used that bn(1  q) = (1)nbn(q). gathering everything, we rewrite eq. (19) as:

d(l) =

g(d)

ld1 "h1(cid:18)1  d,

1

2(cid:19) +



xn=0

(1)n (21n  1)bn

n!

1

n  d# ,

(24)

where we used again that bn( 1

2) = (1  21n)bn. we see from eq. (24) that there is a pole in

the summation for n = d, with residue:

res [d(l)] =

g(d)
ld1

(1)d(21d  1)bd

d!

.

(25)

but note that for odd-d, d 6= 1, bd = 0, and the residue of the vacuum energy density in the
odd-dimensional case vanishes. although b1 =  1
2 , eq. (25) also states that the residue vanishes
for d = 1. eq. (24) is general, and it is valid for the even-dimensional case as well. although

there also appears a pole for even-d, it is cancelled by the gamma function in the denominator

of eq. (18), and eq. (15) is the result, as can easily be checked. in this way we have proven

our assertion that the regularized zero-point energy of massless fermions in the slab-bag is free of

divergencies.

8

from eq. (13) one could have taken another route and use that (s, 1

2) = (2s  1)(s) and the

reection formula:

valid for all s, to nd that:

(cid:18) s

2(cid:19) (s) = s1/2 (cid:18)1  s

2 (cid:19) (1  s),

d(l) = 

c(d) (1  21d)
2d1d/2ld1 (cid:18)d

2 (cid:19) (d).

(26)

(27)

the appearance of possible divergent terms becomes hidden automatically when one uses the

reection formula for zeta functions. the result above is nite for all positive d, and is always

negative, as shown in fig. 1. (in the plot of the energy we left aside the spin degeneracy factor

c(d)).

it tends to  either for d  0 and for d  , taking on the maximum value of
4.9  106 at d  26.1. for d = 4 result eq. (16) is of course obtained, and this value is 7/2
times the casimir energy for a scalar eld satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions on two parallel

plates. the casimir energy for the scalar eld with dirichlet boundary conditions as a function of

the number of dimensions was calculated in ref. [10]; it is also always negative and the maximum

occurs exactly at the same value of d.

the pressure that the vacuum exerts on the plates is also negative, which means that it acts

tending to approximate them, and it is given by:


l



d(l) = 

c(d) (d  1)(1  21d)

2d1d/2ld

(cid:18)d

2 (cid:19) (d).

(28)

in conclusion, in this letter we discuss open questions concerning the divergent pieces of the

regularized zero-point energy of a fermionic eld conned in a nite volume. we show that the

9

regularized zero-point energy of massless fermions in the interior of two parallel plates, the slab-

bag, is nite for any number of space-time dimensions. for such, we made use of dimensional

regularization in the continuous momenta, related with the d  1 transversal directions of innite
length of the bag, and then we analytically extended the hurwitz zeta-function thereby obtained.

for even-dimensional space-times the zero-point energy is nite, without need of renormalization;

in the odd-d case it is shown that the residue of the polar part vanishes identically and, therefore,

the usual subtraction of the polar part of a divergent quantity is also not necessary. also using

an analytic continuation procedure, dolan and nash [14] compute the casimir energy of massless

spin zero elds on spheres sn and nd that, for the case of conformal coupling, the casimir

energy vanishes for even-dimensional spheres, presenting no divergencies, and for odd-dimensional

spheres the residue of the pole which appears is shown to vanish giving a nite value for the casimir

energy. self-interacting fermions at nite temperature and density was studied by ananos et al.

in [15]. these authors investigate, at the 1

n (large n) approximation, the behavior of the eective

potential of the gross-neveu model. still using a mix between zeta and dimensional regularization

procedures, they found that the regularized eective potential is nite for odd-dimensional space-

times. in the case of the yukawa model, the same kind of behavior of the regularized eective

potential was found [16].

one might be tempted to suppose that these results are related with the work of svaiter and

svaiter [17]. these authors proved that the zeta function method is equivalent to the cut-o

method with the subtraction of the polar terms for a neutral massless scalar eld. the basic

10

idea employed by casimir [1], who introduced the cut-o method, is that although the zero-point

energy is divergent, changes in the conguration lead to a nite shift in the total energy. in the

exponential cut-o method, in order to evaluate this shift, the total energy is regularized before the

subtraction from the energy of a reference conguration. this total energy is obtained by adding

the regularized zero-point energy of the eld inside and outside the cavity. this approach seems

very natural if we are dealing with a system in which there is eld inside and outside the cavity.

however, in the bag conguration, where the eld is supposed to exist only inside some region, this

is not a natural approach and we follow the conclusion of the authors of ref. [17] that the casimir

energy evaluated using the analytic extension of the zeta function throws away these divergent

terms. a natural extension of this work is to calculate the regularized zero-point energy for the

fermion eld for dierent conning geometries, such as the cylinder and the sphere, still using an

analytical regularization procedure. now, whether or not the analytical regularization procedure

throws away the polar part of the regularized vacuum energy deserves further investigation.
