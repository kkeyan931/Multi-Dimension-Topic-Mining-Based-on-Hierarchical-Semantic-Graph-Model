abstract

the casimir force between parallel plates of arbitrary kind is shown
to be simply related to the plates transmission and reection coe-
cient. a trivial application of this general relation leads to known
lifshitz force between dielectrics as well as its generalizations.

the simple two ideally conducting parallel plates casimir force f =

hc
a4 [1] recently been measured experimentally[9, 10]. it has various gen-
240
eralizations to dierent kinds of elds, boundary conditions and geometries
whose calculation is in general quite complicated[6, 7, 8][2]. a new vari-
ant in which each of the plates conducts in specic in general dierent di-
rection has been exactly evaluated recently[3] and can hopefully be seen
experimentally[16]. another generalization is to replace the ideal conducting
plates by dielectrics. thus we may for example consider the vacuum energy
corresponding to electromagnetic action in matter 1
 b2) as
some very complicated functional of (x), (x). in general this energy will
contain divergent terms. when we consider the energy dierence between
two congurations (given by (x), (x)) the divergent terms should cancel
provided that the congurations may be related by a physical process which
does not involve a change in internal matter properties (otherwise such a
change would bring about a dependence on the physical uv cuto). in par-
ticular relative displacement of the dierent dielectrics in space should result
in a (nite) force. the special case of the force between two innite parallel

) was considered long ago

we shall consider in the following general congurations depending only
on the z coordinate. we shall show using path integral techniques that in this
case the vacuum casimir energy may be simply related to the transmission
coecient through the system this reduces the computation of the force to a
solution of an elementary one dimensional scattering problem. in particular
to nd the electromagnetic casimir force one merely need to know the clas-
sical reection and transmission coecient through the relevant system. in
fact the relation between the casimir energy and the transmission coecient
follows from of the relation between scattering amplitudes singularities and
the eigenenergies.

we use the functional integral formalism to write the casimir energy as
2 . consider rst a scalar eld described by an

eet = r des = det(...) 1
action s = r d4x( + (z)2). to compute the functional determinant

of this we rst wick rotate and fourier transform in the three directions
in which there is a translation symmetry-t, x, y. after doing that we are

left with the action r d3kr dz(2
energy for this problem is given by summing contributions corresponding to
all possible values of ~k  (kt, kx, ky).

the one dimensional schrodinger like operator hk = 2 +  + k2.

the determinant easily in is seen to satisfy a recursion relation in = ((k2 +
v (zn))z2 + 2in1  in2
which may also be written in the form in+in22in1
hence in the continuum limit i  (k2 + v )i = 0
i.e. the determinant satises the corresponding schrodinger equation.

= (k2 + v (zn))in1

z2

this is in complete accordance with another well known trick[5] for cal-

culating determinants of one dimensional schrodinger operators.

we are assuming that (z) vanishes at z = . under this assumption
we know that the solutions of h = 0 behave asymptotically as   ekz.
let us look for a solution which is regular at minus innity i.e.   ekz for
z  . such a solution always exist and is unique .however in general it
will not be regular at +. rather it behaves in this limit as   aekz +
bekz. the function  is a regular solution of h = 0 if and only if the
constant a(k) = limitz((z)ekz) is zero. on the other hand we know
that a regular solution (which is necessarily given by the above dened )
exists if and only if det h = 0. this suggests the identication det h =
lim((z)ekz).

a more rigorous treatment starts from a similar problem where the parti-
cle is conned to a nite segment [z1, z2] of length l with boundary conditions
(z1) = (z2) = 0. in this case we may dene a function (z) to be the
solution of h = 0 satisfying the boundary conditions (z1) = 0, (z1) = 1

2

and we easily see that (z2) = 0  det h = 0. the advantage of dealing rst
with the problem on a nite segment is that now the argument is correct for
complex valued k while the previous argument was justied only if re(k) > 0
(while we know that most eigenvalues of h have in fact re(k) = 0). hence
we may now conclude that k(z2) and det hk have exactly the same zeroes all
over the complex plane. we also know from general properties of schrodinger
operator in one dimension that all the zeroes of det h are simple since all
eigenvalues are nondegenerated.as k   the problem becomes classical
and one should be able to deduce the behaviour of both k(z2) and of det hk
at that limit from semi classical considerations. this allows concluding that
k(z2) and det hk are equal up to an ((x)-independent) normalization con-
stant.

we are interested in knowing det h only for real positive k. for such k
the boundary conditions (z1) = 0 may be safely replaced by demanding
  ekz for z  . making this change just amounts to neglecting a term
of the order ekl which disappears once when l  . by the same reason
we may also replace (z2) by the coecient of the increasing exponential ekz
in the asymptotic expression for (z) (at this step we also renormalized the
determinant by the constant factor ekl which is legitimate). it is also easy
to see that had we used dierent boundary conditions such as (z1) = 0
instead of (z1) = 0 the result would only change by something proportional
to ekl.

2ar d3k

given any function (z) we may according to the above compute det hk
by solving (possibly numerically) a one dimensional schrodinger equation and
then nd the casimir energy from the relation e = 1
(2)3 log det hk. we
saw that det hk is given by the coecient of ekz in the expression of  at
the right of the potential(i.e.
for z  1) when we assume that left of the
potential (i.e. z  1)  was given by purely ekz. analytically continuing
this to imaginary values of k writing k = iq we see that the analytically
continued det hk becomes just the (inverse) transmission coecient for a
wave of momentum -q hitting the potential (z) from the right to propagate
into the other the side of the potential. this is of course identical to the
more conventionally dened (inverse) transmission coecient for a wave of
momentum +q coming from the left to propagate into the right of the poten-
tial. denoting by t(q) the transmission coecient and changing back from q
to k we have the result: det hk = [t(ik)]1.

next we would like to study the case where the potential (z) is generated
by two objects one located around z = 0 and the other around z = a thus
obtaining their mutual force.

scattering in one dimension is usually described by a 2 2 transfer matrix

as the location of the scattering potential is moved by a distance a to the
right without changing its shape the transfer matrix t change into a1t a

where a is the matrix representing translation: a =   eiqa

for a potential (z) generated by two dierent slabs one located around
z = 0 and the other around z = a the total transfer matrix of the system
is given by the product of the two transfer matrices corresponding to the
two objects: t1 and a1t2a.
so that we have t = a1t2at1. and in
particular t1  (t )2,2 = (t1)1,2(t2)2,1e2iqa + (t1)2,2(t2)2,2 = r

assuming real potential we have the relations r(q) = r(q), t(q) = t(q)
which allow us to make the analytic continuation into q = ik obtaining
det hk = r1(ik)r2(ik)
t1(ik)t2(ik). for the casimir force of interest acting
between the bodies we need only the dependence on the distance a. thus
we may renormalize det hk into 1 + r1(ik)r2(ik)t1(ik)
e2ka. hence the casimir
interaction between the two bodies will be given by

for a massive eld one obtains similar relation with e2ak  e2ak2+m2.
we remark that upon replacing a potential (z) by its mirror image (z)
the reection coecient r changes into r = rtt1 hence the last result may
be also written as

as a simple example suppose that the scattering potential are given by
delta-functions:  = 1(z)+2(za). the transfer and reection coecient
from a delta potential are t(q) = 2iq
2iq. substituting this in the
general result(2) we have e = 1
2+2k e2ka). in particular
we see that for    this reduces as expected to the standard casimir
energy of two parallel plates 1
1440a3 . we can also
see that when  becomes negative the energy develops an imaginary part as
expected. it is also quite easy to generalize the last result to a situation where
there are more then two plates thus obtaining an explicit expression for a
three body force which should exist as long as there is no perfect reection
from the middle plate. also the case of several nite width slabs including
circular periodic boundary conditions can be addressed by these methods[14]
the fact that the casimir force may be expressed in terms of reection
and transmission coecients seems very natural. it is known that one way for
obtaining the casimir force is by summing the pressure exerted on the various
bodies as a result of the vacuum zero modes being scattered of them[12].
clearly such an approach should also result in expressing the force in terms
of reection and transmission coecients.

if instead of a single scalar we have a multicomponent eld most of
the above arguments can be repeated. the only dierence being that now
t(k), r(k) are matrices in internal space and that we have to take the (-
nite dimensional) determinant also with respect to them. thus e/a =
 1
(2)3 log det t(ik) in particular if the dierent components of the eld
do not mix the determinant becomes just the product of the various factors
and the energy the sum of the dierent energies as expected. 3

in order to apply this to the casimir force between two parallel di-
electrics of dielectric constants 1, 2 and widths d1, d2 we just need to
solve the simple classical problem of computing the transmission of a plane
electromagnetic wave through the system made of these two plates. the
classical transfer matrix for an electromagnetic wave when passing from
one dielectric to another through the z = 0 plane can be expressed quite

2if the two slabs are mirror image of eachother i.e r1  r2 then eq(2) imply that they

would always attract

3also for this case we can consider arrays of parallel slabs. for the case mentioned
above of plates conducting in dierent directions which is relevant only for vectorial elds
there is partial reection and incomplete screening of nonadjacent plates

if we have a system of two parallel dielectrics of widths d1, d2 and dielec-
tric constants 1, 2 separated by a distance a inside a medium of dielectric
constant 0 then the total transfer matrix through the system is given by

t = a(qz(d1 + d2 + a))t (0, 2)a(q(2)

z d2)t (2, 0)a(qza)t (0, 1)a(q(1)

z d1)t (1, 0)

(3)
the contribution of each polarization to the casimir force between the two
plates is 1
(2)3 log(t2,2(qz = ik)). since the two polarization are completly
independent the total force is just the sum of these two contributions.
it
is more convinient to make the changes   ikt and qz  ik already in
the expressions (3)for the matrix t this amounts to the changes a(x)

equation (3) may also be used in more general scenarios e.g.

to nd
exactly the torqe between two nonisotropic dielectric plates (evaluated in
some approximation in[11]). the resulting expression for the energy may
turn to be quite complicated in such a general case. some simplication
always occur for large widths d1, d2 since than a(qzd) reduces in(4) to

the above results reduce the problem of computing the casimir energy
for general plate geometry to the problem of computing the reection coef-
cient from the corresponding one dimensional potential. generalizing this
method to arbitrary non planar geometry would be very dicult if not im-
possible. however one may still try to use similar method for problems of
spherical symmetry. using partial wave expansion reduces this to an essen-
tially one dimensional problem. thus we may identify (each specic partial
wave contribution to) the functional determinant with the ratio of the out-
going to the ingoing amplitude i.e. with the phase shift or more accurately
with e2il. this consideration leads us immediately to the following exact
formal expression for the casimir energy

e = xl

this result also follows imeadiatly from known relation between phase shifts
and density of states n(e) = 1

de . the same result can also be obtained

by more standard considerations. suppose we want to compute the casimir
energy by explicitly nding the eigenfrequncies and summing 1
the asymptotic form of the partial wave at innity is  1
r sin(kr  l) we
easily see that enforcing a boundary condition stating that the elds should
vanish on some sphere of very large radius r leads to the simple equation
kr  l(k) = n for the eigenvalues. the casimir energy of a specic partial
wave is therefore el = 1
equation k = k(n) is the solution of kr  l(k) = n however since the di-
ameter a of the scattering potential is much smaller then r we always have
kr >> l(k) and therefore we may write simply k = n
r . as r >> a the

to eq(5). however equation(5) unlike(2) is in general divergent and needs a
nontrivial regularization. the diculty originates from the fact that our pre-
vious normalization condition that of demanding the energy to vanish as the
dierent bodies are moved innitly apart from eachother without changing
their shape becomes meaningless here.

an issue related to the above which we elaborate elsewhere[15] is the
question of experimental testing the repulsive nature of the casimir energy
of the sphere[6, 7]. one cannot contrary to what has been (implied/)stated by
various authours[13][9, 10] check this by nding that two near by conducting
hemispheres repel. indeed the latter case of saperated hemispheres represents
a well dened and in principle testable experimental set-up. however such
experiment are likely to manifest attraction of the two hemispheres. thus
consider the two thin rims at the boundaries of the hemispheres which are
a small distance  apart. on their own the rims have an attractive casimir
attraction of frims  2r hc
3 . since the wavelength of vacuum uctuations
which generate most of this attraction are   , the existance of the remain-
ing bulk of the hemispheres of radius r   is not expected to drastically
modify this force. since this force is vastly larger (by (r/)3!)
than the
repulsive force of a single sphere fsphere  hc
r2 the attractive nature is not
modied.
