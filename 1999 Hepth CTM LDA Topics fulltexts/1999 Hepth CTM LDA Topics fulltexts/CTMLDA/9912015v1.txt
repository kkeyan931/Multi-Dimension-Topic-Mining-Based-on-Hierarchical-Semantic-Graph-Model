we investigate several models of coupled scalar elds that present discrete z2, z2  z2, z3 and other
symmetries. these models support topological domain wall solutions of the bps and non-bps type.
the bps solutions are stable, but the stability of the non-bps solutions may depend on the param-
eters that specify the models. we also investigate extended supersymmetric models, which provide
concrete examples showing how dierent the matter elds behave on the background of bps and
non-bps solutions. the bps and non-bps states give rise to bags, and also to three-junctions that
may allow the presence of networks of topological defects. in particular, we show how the non-bps
defects of a specic model that engenders the z3 symmetry may give rise to a stable regular hexag-
onal network of domain walls.

i. introduction

bogomolnyi, and prasad and sommereld [1], have
presented a way to nd topological solutions that sat-
urate the lower bound in energy. these solutions are
known as bps states, and they are supposed to play
some role in the development of modern particle physics,
because in the supersymmetric theory they are shorter
multiplets, stable. no continuum variation of parame-
ters can modify the bps states of the model, and this is
the reason they are expected to play an important role
in investigating duality in supersymmetric models.

in refs. [24] one has investigated some models of cou-
pled real scalar elds in bidimensional space-time. these
models present peculiar features, such as the presence
of the bogomolnyi bound, with the corresponding ap-
pearence of rst-order dierential equations that solve
the equations of motion in the case of static congu-
rations. these refs. [24] have found topological soli-
tons in specic models by taking advantage of the trial-
orbit method rst introduced by rajaraman in ref. [5].
these investigations provide a concrete way of nding
bps states and suggest several other studies, in particu-
lar on the subject of defects inside defects, as presented
for instance in refs. [68] and more recently in [915].
the investigations of defects inside defects presented in
ref. [11,12,14,15] are natural extensions of the former
papers [24].

in supersymmetric models with chiral superelds the
presence of discrete symmetry may produce bps and
non-bps walls. the non-bps walls are solutions of the
equations of motion, and they do not necessarily sat-
urate the lower bound in energy. but the bps walls
saturate the lower bound in energy, and lie in shorter
multiplets, in a way such that they preserve the super-
symmetry only partially [16,17]. there are bps states
that preserve 1/2 and 1/4 of the supersymmetry [1622],

1

and in the present work we investigate several explicit ex-
amples. we start by rst oering general considerations
in sec. ii. we examine especic models in sec. iii, where
we nd several solutions, of the bps and non-bps type.
these models admit supersymmetric extensions, but in
sec. iv we enlarge the scope of the paper by introducing
another model, that cannot be dened by a superpoten-
tial. this model is dened by a fourth-order polynomial
potential, having the z3 symmetry, as recently discussed
in ref. [23]. see also the more recent work [24,25], where
one can nd other investigations concerning the bps do-
main wall junctions in supersymmetric models.

our work continues in sec. v, where we investigate
stability of several bps and non-bps solutions. this is
done not only to show stability, but also to see how the
bosonic matter behave in the background of bps and
non-bps defects. also, in sec. vi we investigate three
other issues. the rst in sec. vi a, where we include
fermions and investigate the fermionic behavior in the
supersymmetric systems [14,26,27]. here we show ex-
plicitly how the partial breaking of the supersymmetry
appears in bps backgrounds. the bps states preserve
1/2 supersymmetry in the n = 1 supersymmetric ex-
tensions that we consider. the possibility of bps states
preserving 1/4 supersymmetry is subtler, and is shown to
appear as junctions of domain walls in ref. [20]  see also
ref. [21,22]. we investigate the second issue in sec. vi b,
where we consider the entrapment of the other eld, as
in bag models [2830]. this possibility may be imple-
mented in the rst, second and fourth models, and the
bag may be of the bps or non-bps type, depending of
the particular model under consideration. we examine
the third issue in sec. vi c, where we investigate fusion
of defects. here we briey review ref. [19], which in-
troduces investigations valid within the supersymmetric
context, and after we oer another possibility of showing
fusion of defects and stability of junctions, valid beyond

the context of supersymmetry.

in sec. vii we show how one can generate planar net-
woks of bps and non-bps defects. there we show that
the three-junction that appears in supersymmetric mod-
els may be stable, but cannot generate a bps network
of defects. however, when we give up supersymmetry we
nd a model where domain wall junctions are stable, the
three-junction strictly obey the triangle inequality and
generate a stable network of defects. we summarize the
main results in sec. viii, where we end the present work.
the subject of this work may nd direct applications
in diverse branches of physics. besides the recent inter-
est, put forward in refs. [2022], we recall for instance
that the z3 group is the center of su (3), and this may
guide us toward applications envolving strong interac-
tions. some examples can be found in ref. [31,32]. an-
other possibility is related to the z2z3 symmetry, in an
eort to entrap the z3-symmetric portion of the model
inside the topological defect generated by the z2 sym-
metry. other applications include issues related to cos-
mology [33] and magnetic materials [34], and to pattern
formation in systems of condensed matter [35]. the in-
vestigations that we present are done in at space-time,
in the (d, 1) dimensional case. we use natural units, tak-
ing h = c = 1, and the metric tensor presents signature in
the form (+,, ...,). in the present work we are mainly
concerned with the cases d = 1, 2, and 3. we specify the
spatial dimension along with the interest of the subject
under investigation.

ii. general considerations

let us start with two real scalar elds  and . we

consider models dened via the lagrangian density

l =

1
2

 +

1

  v

(1)

this is valid in (d, 1) space-time dimensions. v = v (, )
is the potential. it has the general form

v (, ) =

1
2

w 2

 +

1
2

w 2


(2)

w = w (, ) is some smooth function of the elds 
and , and w = (w/) etc. this is the form of
the (real bosonic portions of the) models we deal with in
the present work. these models admit a supersymmetric
extension, and in the supersymmetric theory the function
w is the superpotential.

models dened via w (, ) present several interesting

properties [24]. the equations of motion are

for static eld congurations living in the (1, 1) space-
time, that is, for elds  = (x) and  = (x) they
reduce to

d2
dx2 = ww + ww

dx2 = ww + ww

(5)

(6)

these equations are solved by rst-order dierential
equations

the energy of solutions that solve the rst-order equa-
tions are bounded to the value eij

b = |wij|, where

wij = w (i, i)  w (j, j)

(9)

here (i, i) is the i-th vacuum state of the model under
consideration. the reason for this is simple: the energy
of static congurations is

to see that the energy gets to the bound eb when the
eld congurations obey the rst-order equations (7) and
(8). this is the bogomolnyi bound, and the correspond-
ing solutions are bps solutions. the bps solutions are
linearly or classically stable  see sec. v.

the energy of bps solutions can be also written as

eb =z

the above result shows that the kinetic (k) and potential
(p) portions of the energy



k =z

fw = w
fw = w

this result is interesting. it shows that for w (, ) har-
monic, we can solve the two (second-order dierential)
equations of motion (5) and (6) with two sets of two
rst-order dierential equations, the set of bogomolnyi
equations (7) and (8), and another one, given by eqs. (23)
and (24).

we make good use of this result by imposing that the
second set of rst-order equations (23) and (24) are still
bogomolnyi equations, that appear via the presence of

another function fw . this new function is dened by

sarily harmonic. we then get the result that potentials
dened by harmonic functions can always be written in

since w and fw are smooth functions, they are neces-
terms of two functions, w andfw . we use this to intro-

duce the complex superpotential

w = w + ifw

the superpotential w = w() now depends on the com-
plex eld  =  + i , and the harmonicity of both w

and fw appears via the cauchy condition on w. this is

the way we get from the investigations [24] to the recent
work in refs. [2022].

we guide ourselves toward the topological solutions by
introducing a topological current. this is the standard
procedure, and we can introduce for instance the topo-
logical current

(26)

(27)

(28)

contribute evenly to the total energy of the solution. al-
though this is shared by all the bps states, it is not
peculiar to bps states, since there are non-bps states
that also have energy evenly distributed in its potential
and kinetic portions  see below.

in the case of two scalar elds, there are other possible
arrangements to the energy (10). we can, for instance,
consider the possibility

e =

2z

dx  w(cid:19)2

d
dx

+ w

dx  w(cid:19)2#
+(cid:18) d
dx(cid:19)

(17)

this expression is also minimized to obey eqs. (13) and
(14) when one sets

d
dx
d
dx

= w

= w

(18)

(19)

we can show that solutions to these equations (18) and
(19) only solve the equations of motion when we impose
on w (, ) the extra condition

w = w

(20)

unfortunately, however, this condition (20) factorizes
w (, ) into the sum w+(+) + w() when one ro-
tates the (, ) plane to (+, ), with

as rstly shown in ref. [15]. the condition (20) turns
the system into two decoupled systems.

we can consider another possibility to rewrite the en-

ergy (10). we set

e =

2z

+ w(cid:19)2

d
dx  w

dx  w(cid:19)2#

d

(22)

this expression is also minimized to obey (13) and (14)
when we write

d
dx
d
dx

(23)

(24)

these equations (23) and (24) solve the equations of mo-
tion when one imposes on w (, ) the extra condition

w + w = 0

j

(29)

it is dened in terms of w(, ), and the topological
charge is directly identifyed with the energy of the topo-
logical solution that satises the pair of rst-order equa-
tions (7) and (8). this denition identies the topological
charge with the energy of the bps solution. it expresses
the fact that the mass of a bps state is completely deter-
mined by its topological charge. this denition provides
a single way to infer stability of the bps states. this is a
nice way of dening the topological current, but it is not
complete, because it cannot see sectors of the non-bps
type. it is only eective for bps sectors, and that is the
reason for the label bps assigned to it. however, since
we need to identify every topological sector, we should
use another topological current. we can consider, for
instance

j  = (cid:18)
(cid:19)

(30)

it obeys j  = 0, and it is also a vector in the (, )
plane. the topological current (30) is the current that we
shall use in this work. we use this denition to obtain,
for static congurations

j t
 j  = t  = 2 k(x)

(31)

3

where k(x) is the kinetic energy density of the solution.
this property can be used to infer stability of junctions,
for congurations that present energy density evenly dis-
tributed in their kinetic and potential energy densities.
this is so because in this case t = 2k(x) = k(x) + p(x)
gives the full energy density, and may be used to show
that the junction process occurs exothermically. this
result was already introduced in ref. [23], and oers a
way of showing how the process of junctions of defects
may occur exothermically in models dened outside the
context of supersymmetry  see sec. vi c.

up to here the calculations were done in (1, 1) space-
time dimensions. however, we can easily immerse the
system into (2, 1) or into (3, 1) space-time dimensions.
in the rst case, in d = 2 the solutions can be seen as
domain ribbons, and the energy is now multiplied by the
length of the ribbons. in the second case, in d = 3 we get
domain walls, and the energy is to be multiplied by the
area of the wall. the planar case is necessary for intro-
ducing junctions of domain ribbons [or of domain walls
if one immerses the system in the (3, 1) space-time] and
their corresponding planar networks. there are several
distinct possibilities, and in the sequel we specify some
cases. we recall that we single out topological sectors
using pairs of vacuum states. for bps sectors the en-
ergy is obtained via the superpotential, and we shall also
use the notation tij = |w (i, i)  w (j , j)|, identi-
fying the bps sectors with tensions or energies of the
topological defects.

iii. some specific models

our aim here is to introduce models of coupled scalar
elds, to illustrate how one can nd topological solutions
of the bps and non-bps type. we investigate several
models of coupled scalar elds, dened with smooth func-
tions w (, ). we organize the subject in the ve subsec-
tions that follow, where we examine ve dierent models.

a. the rst model

we consider the function

w (1)(, ) =  +

1
3

3 + 2

(32)

where  and  are real parameters. the potential is

v1(, ) =

1
2

2(2  1)2 + (2  1)2
1
24 + 2222
+
2

(33)

this model was rst investigated in ref. [2], but here
we bring new results. the equations of motion for static
eld congurations are given by

4

d2
dx2 = 22(2  1) + 22(2 +
d2
dx2 = 2(2  1) + 422 + 223

)2




(34)

(35)

these equations are solved by congurations that also
solve the pair of rst-order dierential equations

d
dx
d
dx

= (2  1) +  2
= 2   

(36)

(37)

solutions that solve these rst-order equations are bps
solutions.

the potential (33) has four absolute minima when
/ > 0, and two minima when / < 0. for / > 0
the minima are

(1, 0)

(0,p/)

(38)

topological solutions are the solutions that connect adja-
cent minima. thus, the asymptotic behavior of the elds
is governed by the set of minima of the potential. for
/ > 0 the system supports several topological sectors.
their energies or tensions are given by, for solutions that
connect the minima (1, 0) and (1, 0)

t1
bp s =

4
3 ||

(39)

for solutions that connect the minima (1, 0) and

(0,p/) we get

t 1
bp s =

2
3 ||

(40)

for the non-bps solution that connects the minima

(0,p/) and (0,p/) we obtain
3 ||s 

t 1
nbp s =



4

(41)

the sector dened with solutions connecting the vac-
uum (1, 0) to (1, 0) is a bps sector, because these vacua
are connected by bps solutions. the sector dened with

are connected by bps solutions. however, the sector de-

solutions connecting the vacuum (1, 0) to (0,p/) or
(0,p/) also is a bps sector, because these vacua
ned with solutions connecting the vacuum (0,p/)
to (0,p/) directly, is a non-bps sector, since there are

no bps solutions satisfying the rst-order equations and
connecting the two minima directly. the reason for this
is that |w (1)| = 0 in this case, and this would produce
zero energy solutions. we note that w (1)( = 0, ) van-
ishes independently of the values of the parameters that
specify w (1). this implies that there is no way of making
this sector a bps sector, under any smooth changes of
the parameters  and . this sector is a non-bps sector,

since it can be identifyed with a topological charge. in
particular, we can also nd explicitly some non-bps so-
lutions, which are solutions that satisfy the (second order
dierential) equations of motion  see below.

we search for topological solutions in the rst sector,
which connects the two minima (1, 0). we investigate
the specic model via the rst-order eqs. (36) and (37).
they present the two pair of topological solutions

(x) =  tanh( x)
(x) = 0

and

(x) =  tanh(2  x)

(x) = s 

  2 sech(2  x)

(42)
(43)

(44)

(45)

the rst pair is of the one-component type, and the sec-
ond pair is of the two-component type. we notice that in
the limit   /2, the second pair of solutions colapses
into the rst one. the rst pair imposes no restriction
on the parameters of the model. the second pair exists
if and only if  < /2. these two pairs of solutions are
classically or linearly stable, as it has been shown in [3,4]
 see also sec. v. they have the same energy, and the
two-component bps solution is continuosly parametrized
by   (0, /2]. the two-component solution denes the
elliptical orbit in the (, ) plane

2 +



  2

2 = 1

(46)

for  < /2. we notice that the orbit is circular for
 = /3.

the rst pair of solutions is important for investigating
the presence of defects inside defects  see for instance
refs. [11,12,14,15]. the point here is that one of the two
elds plays a role only inside the defect generated by the
other eld, and so the host defect is given in terms of
one eld, in the one-component form. see ref. [33] for
further considerations. the second pair of topological
solitons, the two-component solution may play a role in
applications to condensed matter, as for instance in the
case investigated in refs. [4,36]. the point here is that
in applications to systems described by polymeric chains
the two elds are used to map two relevant degrees of
freedom of the chain, and so none of them can vanish
everywhere. in this case we have to search for solutions
where none of the two elds is zero in the full region in
position space, which are solutions of the two-component
type.

there are other possible applications. for instance,
the one-component pair (42) and (43) and the two-
component pair (44) and (45) are solutions that also ap-
pear in magnetic materials [34]. there they are known as
ising and bloch walls, respectively. the two-component
bloch wall has a peculiar behavior, that can be used to

5

understand specic features of interfaces between mag-
netic domains. the issue here is that if one looks at these
solutions as vectors in the (, ) plane, for x spanning the
interval (,) they describe a straight line and an el-
liptical arc connection between the two minima (1, 0),
respectively, behaving very much like linearly and ellip-
tically polarized light. for this reason, the block walls
can be seen as chiral interfaces between domains with
dierent magnetization, and this can be used to describe
the wall motion in magnetic materials [37]. furthermore,
these walls can be charged and we may introduce charge
by making the  eld complex, or by coupling fermions
to the system. we shall further explore such connections
elsewhere.

for / < 0 we have only two vacuum states. they are
(1, 0) and now we have a single topological sector, with
the same energy and topological charge obtained before,
for the corresponding sector. we notice that the rst pair
of solutions (42) and (43) solves the rst-order equations
even for / < 0. this one-component solution is still of
the bps type for / < 0, but now no topological defect
can be nested inside it. the reason is that for / < 0 the
potential (33) shows no spontaneous symmetry breaking
in the independent  direction, and so it cannot support
topological defect anymore.

we also note that for  = 2, the potential v1(, )
decouples into the form v (1)
(). this result
shows that the model decouples into two single-eld mod-
els, showing that the limit   /2 is uninteresting, at
least from the point of view of models of coupled scalar
eld.

the second pair of solutions (44) and (45) is not real
for / < 0, and we believe that a two-component bps
solution cannot be present for / negative. although
we could not oer a general proof, it is possible to show
that this is indeed the case for / = 1. the reason
here is that for  =  the rst-order equations (36) and
(37) imply [15]

(cid:18)2 

1
3

2  1(cid:19) = 0

(47)

this condition is satised by the rst pair, but for  6= 0
one must have

2 = 1 +

1
3

2

(48)

this restriction forbids the presence of nite orbits con-
necting the vacuum states (1, 0) in conguration space.
we return to the case where / > 0. the minima
(1, 0) and (1, 0) may be connected by stable bps solu-
tions by the two dierent paths

the minima (0,p/) and (0,p/) may also be con-

nected by stable bps solutions by the two dierent paths

(1, 0)  (0,p/)  (1, 0)
(0,p/)  (1, 0)  (0,p/)

the energy spent to connect (1, 0) and (1, 0) is equal
to the energy of the rst pair of solutions, that connects
the minima (1, 0) and (1, 0) by a straight line, or to the
energy of the second pair, which connects the minima
(1, 0) and (1, 0) by an elliptic arc. on the other hand,

by 2t(1)
bp s = (4/3)||, but in this case we do not have bps
solutions connecting these two minima directly. however,

the energy necessary to connect the minima (0,p/)
and (0,p/) using any of the two paths above is given
we can have non-bps solutions connecting (0,p/) and
(0,p/) by a straight line. to see this explicitly we

consider  = 0 in the specic system to get the equation
of motion for the static eld  = (x)

the solutions are



(cid:19) 

d2

dx2 = 22(cid:18)2 
(x) = s 



tanh(p x)

(49)

(50)

the corresponding non-bps energy is (4/3)||p/, as

already presented in eq. (41). we recognize that for
/ > 1 the non-bps solutions can decay into a pair of
stable bps states that connect the same minima, and this
indicates instability of the non-bps solutions. indeed, in
ref. [15] it was shown that these non-bps solutions are
stable for / < 1, and unstable for / > 1.

this model also decouples for  = , as we have al-
ready shown in ref. [12].
in this case the symmetry
z2  z2 changes to the z4 one, but here a rotation by
/4 changes the potential as v1(, )  v (+, ) =
v+(+) + v(). thus, unfortunately the model is un-
interesting from the point of view of systems of coupled
scalar elds in the limit   .
write

we expose other features of the model using w (1). we

w (1)

 = 2, w (1)

 = 2, w (1)

 = 2

(51)

we see that w (1) is harmonic when   . this means
that the model admits another pair of rst-order equa-
tions. this pair follows from (23) and (24)

and

d

=   2  2

(52)

(53)

these equations also furnish solutions to the equations of
motion, for   . as we have already seen, for  
 the model presents a single topological sector, already
investigated. but we notice that w (1) is also harmonic
in the limit   0, independently of the parameters 
and . we use this into the above eqs. (52) and (53) to
get  = 0 and

d
dx

= (cid:18)2 



(cid:19)

(54)

we consider  > 0. in this case the above equation is
easily solved to give

(x) =s 



tanh(p x)

(55)

the pair  = 0 and  in (55) is the pair of non-bps
solutions that we have already found. here, however,
we found the non-bps solution as an explicit solution
of the new rst-order dierential equations in systems of
coupled real scalar elds. although this is a non-bps
solution, we have already shown in sec. ii that its energy
is composed of equal portions of kinetic (k) and potential
(p) contributions. in terms of densities we have, explic-
itly

k1(x) = p1(x) =

1

2sech4(cid:16)p x(cid:17)

(56)

we can now understand this feature by realizing that
although this pair of solutions is non-bps, in the reduced
system where   0, the  eld solution is indeed a bps
solution.

b. the second model

we consider another model, dened by the function

w (2)(, ) = (2  1)

in this case the potential is

v2(, ) =

1
2

2(2  1)2 + 2222

(57)

(58)

this model was also considered in ref. [27]. the equa-
tions of motion are

2
t2 

2
x2 + 22(2  1) + 422 = 0

2
t2 

2
x2 + 422 = 0

(59)

(60)

for static elds the energy is minimized for congura-
tions that obey the rst-order equations

d
dx
d
dx

= 2

= (2  1)

(61)

(62)

the model presents two vacuum states, given by
(1, 0). in contraposition with the former model, how-
ever, this new model presents no bps sector, because the

6

w (2)

 = 2, w (2)

 = 0, w (2)

 = 2

(66)

the potential presents three minima, (i, i), i = 1, 2, 3.
they are

function (57) obeys w (2)(2 = 1, ) = 0, and then gives
|w (2)| = 0. this means that the rst-order equations
(61) and (62) present no topological solutions connect-
ing the two vacuum states. the point here is similar
to the one considered in the rst model. the topologi-
cal solutions that obey the rst-order equations (61) and
(62) present energy in the form |w|, but this quan-
tity vanishes and we know that zero energy solutions are
nothing but the trivial vacuum congurations. on the
other hand, the vacuum states (1, 0) can be connected
by topological but non-bps solutions. the explicit form
of the solutions is given by

(x) =  tanh( x)
(x) = 0

the energy or tension of the solution is

t2
nbp s = (4/3)||

(63)
(64)

(65)

this result reproduces the value presented by the similar
one-component bps solution (42) and (43) of the rst
model.

we compare this model with the rst one to see that
it provides a nice way to understand how the bps and
non-bps solutions behave. we notice that

d
dx

d
dx

there is only one way to make w (2) harmonic, which
implies setting   0. the new rst-order equations
correspond to the equations (23) and (24) for w (2), in
the limit   0. they give

d
dx

= (2  1)

this is solved by

(x) =  tanh(x)

(67)

(68)

the pair of solutions formed by  = 0 and  as in eq. (68)
is the pair of non-bps solutions that we have already
found for this model. this is another exemple where one
gets non-bps solutions as solutions to rst-order dier-
ential equations. this is perhaps the most natural way
of understanding why this non-bps solution has energy
evenly distributed into its kinetic and potential portions.
in terms of energy densities we have

k2(x) = p2(x) =

1

2sech4( x)

w (3)(0,p4/3) = 
w (3)(1,p1/3) = 2

(76)
the energies of the bps states are ||, 3 ||, and 4 ||.
although the three sectors are bps sectors, they do not
present the z3 symmetry one nds in the vacuum sectors.
the highest energy is associated to the sector connecting

the minima (1,p1/3). this is the only sector where

we can nd explicit solutions. they are given by

(x) =  tanh(3 x)

(x) = p1/3

this pair of bps solutions represents an orbit in the
(, ) plane, describing a straight line connecting the

two vacua (1,p1/3). the other bps solutions are

not straight lines connecting the corresponding vacuum
states, and cannot be obtained by rotating the (, )
plane according to the z3 symmetry. the defect sectors
do not present the z3 symmetry one nds in the vacuum
sectors.

the second derivative of the superpotential can be eas-
ily calculated. the results show that there is no interest-
ing way of making the superpotential w (3) harmonic.

we can use fw (4) to write fw (4)
andfw (4)
 = 2, showing thatfw (4) is also harmonic, as
complex superpotential w (4) = w (4) + ifw (4) and the

complex eld  =  + i. we change notation and write

expected. as we have suggested in sec. ii, we use the

(91)

the potential has only two minima, at the values  = 0
and 2 = / if / > 0, or at the values  = 0 and
2 = / if / < 0. these two case are similar,
and we consider / > 0. the two minima (p/, 0)
and (p/, 0) dene a topological sector. the explicit

solution is given by

(x) = s

this restriction constrains the orbits in the (, ) plane
in such a way that no nite orbit can connect the two
minima, unless in the case  = 0, in which one repro-
duces the topological solution just obtained. this model
has a single topological sector, but it presents no fam-
ily of topological solutions, like the family (44) and (45)
obtained in the rst model.

we use w (4) to obtain

iv. another model

in this sec. iv we consider another model, given in
terms of a fourth-order polynomial potential. here, how-
ever, we relax the imposition of the potential be given
in terms of some superpotential. we consider the model
presented in ref. [23]. it presents the z3 symmetry, and
is dened with the potential

this potential was rst introduced in ref. [38]. the

equations of motion for static congurations are

(132)

the potential has three minima, at the points

these minima form an equilateral triangle, invariant un-
der the z3 rotations. the distance between the minima
is d = (3/2)3. these minima are equal to the minima
of the fourth model, if one sets  = (27/8) in that case.
we can obtain the solutions explicitly. the easiest
way to do this follows by rst examining the sector that

connects the minimum (3/4)(1,3) to (3/4)(1,3).
this is so because in this case we set  = 3/4, searching
for a strainght-line segment connecting these minima in

the label () is used to identify kink and antikink. these
solutions are straight-line segments connecting the vac-
uum states in the conguration space, as depicted in
fig. 1. all the solutions have the same energy, given
by

t =

9

4r 27

8 ||

(144)

they also have the nice property of having identical ki-
netic and potential portions of energy. in terms of energy
density they are

k(x) = p(x) =

this feature is important for showing the the model sup-
ports three-junctions that generate a stable network of
defects  see sec. vi c and sec.vii.

ima v1 = (3/2)(1, 0), and v2
dened by the potential of eq. (129), that presents z3 sym-
metry.

3 = (3/4)(1, 

,

the energies of the solutions are evenly distributed into
their kinetic and potential portions. we can very natu-
rally understand this feature by recalling the calculation
done explicitly in the sector with  = 3/4, constant.
there the model was shown to reduce to a model of a
single eld, a model where the topological solutions are
bps solutions.

v. stability

in this sec. v we deal with issues concerning stability of
the topological solutions in (1, 1) dimensions. we follow
ref. [15], recalling that the linear stability also shows
how the bosonic elds behave in the background of the
classical solutions. we examine linear stability for two
coupled real scalar elds using (x, t) = (x) + (x, t)
and (x, t) = (x) + (x, t). here

(x, t) =xn
(x, t) =xn

n(x) cos (wnt)

n(x) cos (wnt)

(146)

(147)

are the uctuations around the static solutions  and .
we use the equations of motion to get the equation for
stability

d2

(cid:18)1

dx2 + u(cid:19)(cid:18)n

n(cid:19)
n(cid:19) = w2
n(cid:18)n
for w2
here 1 is the 2  2 identity matrix and

n  0 (w2

n < 0) we have stable (unstable) solutions.

(148)

(149)

u =(cid:18) v

v(cid:19)

the bar over the potential means that after obtaining
the derivatives, we should substitute the elds  and 
by their classical static values (x) and (x).

we consider the rst model rst. in this case the ex-
plicit calculation gives to the matrix u (1) the elements
u (1)

ij = 22mij, where

2 +(cid:18)

duce the rst-order operators

these operators allow writing h1 = ss, where h1 is
the hamiltonian corresponding to the rst model

h1 = 1

d2
dx2 + u (1)

(155)

this factorization h1 = ss shows that h1 is positive
semi-denite, and so can have no negative eigenvalue. we
then conclude that the bps solutions are stable, since
they solve the rst-order equations we need to get the
rst-order operators (153) and (154).

in this rst model, the one-component solutions can
be solved explicitly. for the bps pair (42) and (43) we
get the following set of discrete eigenvalues: in the rst
direction, the  direction

splits into two equal portions that present equal bps
states. we shall show in sec. vi a that the supersym-
metric theory also splits into two uncoupled pieces.

let us now consider the second model. for the pair

plement explicit calculation in the sector connecting the

minima (1,p1/3), where we know the bps solution

we cannot present explicit investigations concerning
stability of solutions of the fth model, because we do
not know any explicit solution in this case. thus, we
now consider another model, dened via the potential

vi. further considerations

the models investigated above present similar bps
and non-bps solutions. they provide concrete ways of
investigating how the scalar elds behave in the back-
ground of bps and non-bps solutions. we explore some
possibilities in the next sec. vi a and sec. vi b.
in
sec. vi c we investigate intersection of defects.

a. supersymmetry

the bosonic models introduced by the general poten-
tial (2) can be seen as the real bosonic sectors of su-
persymmetric models, with two real chiral superelds
1 = (1, 1, f1) and 2 = (2, 2, f2). in terms of the
component elds, such supersymmetric models are de-
ned by adding to the lagrangean density of the bosonic
models the fermionic counterpart, which is specifyed via
the yukawa coupling

yij (, ) =

2w
ij

(178)

here we are identifying the two scalar directions 1 and
2 with  and , respectively. the supersymmetric the-
ory has two majorana spinors, 1 and 2. we work in
the (1, 1) dimensional space-time.
in this scenario we
have n = 1, and we may say that 1/2 of the supersym-
metry is in the pair (, 1), while the other 1/2 belongs
to the other pair (, 2). this works for real superpoten-
tials, and in the following we consider the rst and second
models, where we have already found explicit solutions.
we use results for the second derivative of w (1) and
w (2) to write these quantities in the background of the
bps and non-bps solutions that the respective models
engender. for the rst model, we use the pair (42) and
(43) to get, in the bps sector that connects the two vacua
(1, 0),

w (1)
w (1)
w (1)

 =  2 tanh(x)
 =  2 tanh(x)
 = 0

(179)

(180)

(181)

for the second model we use results of sec. iii b. we
get, in the non-bps sector that connetcs the two vacua
(1, 0)

w (2)
w (2)

 = 0

 = w (2)
 =  2 tanh(x)

(182)

(183)

that the bps state preserves 1/2 supersymmetry. this
1/2 supersymmetry is related to the portion in the pair
(, 1). however, the other 1/2 portion is broken, as we
can see in the subsector governed by the pair (, 2).
the breaking appears because in the subsector (, 2)
the fermionic matter can no longer add to the bosonic
contribution in a supersymmetric way.

in the second model, in the non-bps background that
appears in sec. iii b, the only non-vanishing contribution
to the yukawa coupling comes from w (2)
 . here the two
fermionic sectors communicate with one another, and the
non-bps state can no longer live in a shorter multiplet.
the supersymmetry is then completely broken in this
sector.

the pair of non-bps solutions in the rst model has 
as in eq. (50), and  = 0. this requires  > 0. in this
case we get

w (1)
w (1)

 = w (1)

 = 0

 =  2p tanh(p x)

(184)

(185)

this non-bps sector behaves very much like the non-bps
sector of the second model. the two majorana fermions
are coupled, leaving no room for the non-bps state to
live in a shorter multiplet. the supersymmetry is also
broken completely in this background.

in the rst model, we notice that the limit   
decouples the sector (, 1) from the sector (, 2). in
this case the z2  z2 symmetry changes to the z4 one,
but the model decouples into two models, of a single eld,
each one having identical bps sectors, that preserve each
one of the related supersymmetry. from the point of view
of coupled elds, however, the model is uninteresting at
 = . this result shows that in this model there is no
room for the z4 symmetry, for the appearence of four-
junctions  see below.

we now focus attention on the fourth and fth mod-
els. they are given in terms of complex superpotentials,
and we can follow [19] to get to their supersymmetric ex-
tensions. to present explicit investigations we need ex-
plicit solutions. we have explicit solutions for the fourth
model, but it is very much like the rst and second mod-
els, because it has only one topological sector, and in
this case the bps state breaks 1/2 supersymmetry. for
this reason we do not present explicit investigations for
this model. however, we recall that the potential can be

generated by w (4) and fw (4), in the form of the com-
plex superpotential w (4) + ifw (4). this gives, using the

complex eld  =  + i

3

(186)

w2() =  

1
3

we notice that the fermions behave dierently in bps
and non-bps backgrounds, as expected.
in the bps
background w (1)
 vanishes, and the two fermionic elds
do not communicate with one another. because the
scalar elds behave as shown in sec. v, we see explicitly

evidently, this generates a fourth-order polynomial po-
tential and we may make the supersymmetric extension,
in which the bps state preserves 1/2 supersymmetry.
we use results of the former sec. iii d to get the ten-
sion for the single topological sector of the model in the

13

1 = (4/3)||p/. in the present case we cannot

form t(2)
have the z3 symmetry one needs to allow the appearence
of three-junctions. this last case is only possible when
one consider superpotentials of at least the fourth-order
power in the complex eld, in accordance with the rea-
soning of refs. [20,21].

for this reason, we now focus attention on the fth
model. like the third model, it also presents three vac-
uum states, but now the potential is generated by w (6)

and by fw (6). here we write the complex superpotential

(187)

w3 =  

1
4

4

which may give rise to three-junctions in the super-
symmetric model. we use results of sec. iii e to get
1 = (3/4)3|| 4. this is the value of the tension
t(3)
of each of the three solutions that connect the three
vacuum states obtained in sec. iii e.
in this case the
three-junction strictly obeys the triangle inequality one
needs to stabilize the three-junction. the fth model is
the model where the three-junction appears as a bps
state that breaks 1/4 supersymmetry, as already shown
in refs. [20,21]. here we do not present explicit calcula-
tions because we could not nd any explicit solution in
this case. although the fth model supports stable three-
junctions, we cannot generate a bps network of defects,
as we shall see in sec. vii.

b. entrapment of the other eld

in the rst model, we can further understand the im-
portance of the topological solutions by investigating the
potential v1(, ) at  = 0 and at 2 = 1. we do this
because this model presents the one-component bps so-
lution (42) and (43). we have 2 = 1 outside the bps
defect, and  = 0 at x = 0, at the center of the defect.
we get

2(cid:18)2 
v1(  0, ) =
v1(2  1, ) = 222 +

(cid:19)2

(188)

(189)

for / > 0 the potential (188) shows the presence of
spontaneous symmetry breaking in the independent 
direction in the (, ) plane.
in this case the  eld
presents squared masses given by

m2
(in) = 4
(out) = 42
m2

(190)

(191)

where in and out identify the region inside and outside
the defect. we see that the ratio of masses is

m2
m2

(in)
(out)

=




(192)

14

this ratio identies the region 0 < / < 1 in the space
of parameters where the eld  entraps the other eld.
for a given , we see that the parameter  controls the
ratio of squared masses. thus, the eciency of the en-
trapment depends on .

this model can be used as a bag model [28], similar
to the models in refs. [29,30]. here we can further en-
large the model by changing dimensions from (1, 1) to
(3, 1) and making the  eld complex, going from the
z2  z2 symmetry to the z2  u (1). however, since in-
side the defect formed by (x), the  eld still engenders
spontaneous symmetry breaking for  > 0, we can only
circumvent the presence of goldstone bosons when one
gauge the related u (1) symmetry, making it local. the
model that emerges presents the symmetry z2  ul(1).
since we started in (3, 1) dimensions, inside the wall the
theory is eectively (2, 1) dimensional. this is an al-
ternate mechanism for dimensional reduction, and inside
the wall the eective theory may very naturally develop
the callan-harvey eect [39], if one appropriately cou-
ples fermions to the second eld, . this scenario seems
to appear interesting, and we shall further explore this
possibility in a separate report.

the rst model is simpler for  < 0.

in this case,
spontaneous symmetry breaking no longer appear inside
the wall formed by the  eld. however, the wall is still
of the bps type. the potential v1(, ) changes in a way
such that the ratio (192) becomes

m2
m2

(in)
(out)


2

= 

(193)

this result shows that the topological defect generated
by  can still entrap  mesons for 0 > / > 2, acting
like a bag for the elementary excitations of the eld . if
we change the symmetry z2  z2 to z2  u (1) by mak-
ing the  eld complex, in this case we do not need to
make the u (1) symmetry local, and we can still explore
the presence of a global symmetry within the wall. work
in this direction was already presented in ref. [40], in
a model inspired in the work of ref. [6], with a poten-
tial that diers from the one here proposed. we believe
that our model may give further insight into the issues
that arise in this scenario. further applications can be
done, as for instance in ref. [41], where one explores the
presence of diuse domain walls at intersecting at di-
rections within the cosmological scenario. also, we can
follow ref. [42] to investigate issues concerning hybrid in-
ation, envolving features that requires at least two real
scalar elds, the inaton eld and another one, which is
in general used to break the symmetry.

the second model is dened with the potential (58).

here we have

v2( = 0, ) =

2

1
2

v2(2 = 1, ) = 222

(194)

(195)

thus the squared masses associated to the  eld are

m2
(in) = 0
(out) = 42
m2

(196)

(197)

in this case the non-bps defect always entraps the eld
, acting like a bag for the elementary  excitations.
here, however, the  meson is massless inside the bag.
this shows that the entrapment is more ecient in this
model, although the basic solution, the bag, is of the
non-bps type.

we can investigate the fourth model similarly.

it is
dened by the potential (80) and we can write, for / >
0,

v4(0, ) =

no spontaneous symmetry breaking appears inside the
-defect anymore, and so the model cannot support de-
fect inside defect. however, the squared masses of the
elementary  mesons are

that defects may nest defects if the model engenders the
z2  z2 symmetry in systems of two real scalar elds.
as we are going to see below, to have intersection of de-
fects we must necessarily enlarge the z2 symmetry to
at least the z3 one. for this reason, we can think of a
model that presents the z2  z3 symmetry, composed
of three real scalar elds, one presenting the z2 symme-
try, and the other two controlling the z3 symmetry. in
(3, 1) space-time dimensions the rst eld engenders the
z2 symmetry, and we can certainly get to the case where
it may give rise to a domain wall, which may nest the two
other elds in its interior. within this scenario, if the z3
symmetry related to the second and third elds is still
eective we get the possibility of having planar network
of defects nested inside domain walls. we take advantage
of the model investigated in sec. iv to present a model
that seems to work correctly. this model is dened by

v (, , ) =

(in) = 2

(200)

we get the ratio

it behaves standardly in (3, 1) space-time dimensions and
is such that v () = v (, 0, 0) obeys

v () =

(202)

we consider that the eld  = (x) depends only on x.
thus, it supports bps defects with the explicit form

this ratio does not depend on the parameters  and ,
but the topological defect may also entrap  mesons.
this is another model, in which the topological state may
simulate a bag to entrap the elementary excitations of the
other eld. in this case, however, the ecience of the en-
trapment can no longer be controlled by the parameters
that denes the model.

the second and fourth models may also be immersed
in the (3, 1) dimensional space-time. this immersion
provide alternative ways to investigate the behavior of
the current generated by making the second eld com-
plex, as commented above. they give similar scenarios
for charged walls, and may present distinct physical con-
tents.

other applications include the diverse issues recently
investigagted in refs.
[1215,26,43]. we can, for in-
stance, enlarge the models in order to break the sym-
metry and/or the supersymmetry. this possibility may
give rise to fermi balls [26], fermi disks [14], and other
charged objects [43], which depend on the particular
space-time dimension one starts with, and on the param-
eters that dene the terms added to allow the symmetry
breaking. furthermore, we can follow refs. [12,13,15] to
extend the scenario of nested defects to the case of nested
network of defects. this picture follows as a direct gener-
alization of the result of ref. [15], which shows explicitly

3

tanh(cid:16)3  x(cid:17)

(x) = 

(205)
the corresponding energy density is 33 2. we also
notice that the potentials vin(, ) = v (0, , ) and
vout(, ) = v (3/2, , ) are such that

vin(, ) =

2 + 2(2 + 2)2  2(2  32)

(206)

and

vout(, ) = 2(2 + 2)2  2(2  32)

2(2 + 2)

(207)

we see that the z3 symmetry of the pair of elds (, ) is
preserved both inside and outside the domain wall gener-
ated by the rst eld, . in the region inside the domain
wall, vin(, ) has minima at the points

(211)

these results show that the eld  engenders an ecient
mechanism for the entrapment of the pair of elds (, )
in this model. we shall further explore this and other
related issues in another work.

c. intersection of defects

the process of intersection of defects was already ex-
plored in ref. [19], in the case of supersymmetric eld
theories. there, the basic idea was to show that the
intersection of two extended objects is energetically ad-
missible when it can be seen as a reaction that occurs
exothermically. this may be translated into the expres-
sion

tik < tij + tjk

(212)

where tik, tij , and tjk are the energies or tensions associ-
ated to the fusion of the two defects, and to the individu-
als defects, respectively. the crucial point here is that in
supersymmetric theories the topological charge t of the
defect appears as a central charge, and for bps states
one gets t = |t |. if one uses tij = |tij|, tjk = |tjk|, and
tik = |tij + tjk| the triangle inequality tik  tij + tjk
follows naturally.
the issue is then to make the triangle inequality valid
strictly, and this is only possible in supersymmetric sys-
tems described by complex superpotentials, whose values
at the vacuum states dene points in the complex plane,
not aligned into a straight-line segment. the reason for
excluding aligned points is clear, since in this case we can
never present a triangle inequality that is strictly valid.
this is the reason behind the fact that in the third
model explored in sec. iii c we have obtained the ener-
gies or tensions of the bps states as ||, 3||, and 4||,
giving 4|| = || + 3||. the superpotential of the third
model is real, and the values of w (3) in the complex plane
are always in the real axis.

the fourth model is dierent. it was investigated in
sec. iii d, but it has only one topological sector, the
bps sector connecting the two minima of the potential,
or the two singular points of the superpotential there
introduced.
it has only one type of topological defect,
and cannot be used for intersection of defects.

the fth model

is the supersymmetric model that
opens the possibility for the presence of stable intersec-
tion of extended objects, giving rise to a triple junction

(213)

let us consider the case
wn =   

1

n + 1

 (n +1)

(214)

with  and  real parameters. this model presents the
zn symmetry. the vacuum states are singular points of
the superpotential. they obey n = /, and the n
solutions are, using  = an  with a real and positive,

k = a e2i[(k1)/n ], k = 1, 2, ..., n.

(215)

the topological sectors connect pairs of adjacent vacua,
and in general the number of bps sectors is n (n  1)/2.
their energies or tensions are given in terms of the values
of the superpotential in the singular points, that is

t(n )
ij = |wn ( i)  wn ( j )|

(216)

the tensions can be classied according to the integer n,
n = 1, 2, ..., [n/2], where [n/2] stands for the greatest
integer not greater than n/2 itself. these tensions have
the explicit values

t(n )
n =

n a(n +1)

2 < 2 t(n )

, n  4, and t(n )

, n  6, and so forth.

the integer n identies topological sectors described via
the connection between a given vacuum, and its n  th
neighbor: n = 1 for connections between rst neighbors,
n = 2 for second neighbors, and so forth. we can check
that these tensions are ordered in the form t(n )
k < t(n )
k+1,
for k = 1, ..., < [n/2], and n  4. this order also shows
that the direct connection between two vacuum states is
always less energetic than any other possible connection.
for instance, t(n )
2 +
t(n )
1 < 3 t(n )
more recently, in ref. [23] we considered another sys-
tem, as presented in sec. iv. the model presents the z3
symmetry, but it is described by a potential that cannot
be written in terms of some superpotential. in this case
the key issue relies on nding a way out of supersymmetry
to show that the fusion of defects still occurs exothermi-
cally. in the supersymmetric case one can use interesting
properties to make the reasoning naturally simple.
in
the non-supersymmetric case, however, we have found
non-bps solutions that presents the interesting property
of having kinetic and potential portions of the energy
evenly distributed to compose the total energy of the de-
fect. as we have shown, such a property is also shared
by all the bps solutions, and so we can use it to present
a new reasoning, that works within and beyond the con-
text of supersymmetry. the reasoning follows from the
topological current presented in eq. (30). here we have

thus t = 2k(x), and for static solutions that presents
equal kinetic and potential portions we get t = k(x) +
p(x) = (x), or better

tij =z

(219)

we consider fusion of two defects in the model investi-
gated in sec. iv. the topological defects there obtained
obey k(x) = p(x). thus, we can use

(220)

these are the planar topological states of the model con-
sidered in sec. iv.

also, we take advantage of the symmetry of the model to
see that if the pair (, ) represents a solution in a given
sector, all the other solutions can be obtained by rotating
the solution according to the z3 symmetry. this means
that we can write

ij (x)

(cid:18)
ij(x)(cid:19) =(cid:18) cos( ij )

 sin( ij )



sin( ij )

cos( ij )(cid:19)(cid:18)(x)

(x)(cid:19) (221)

here  ij is the angle between the given solution (, )
and the solution (ij , ij). in the z3 model under con-
sideration i,j can only be 2/3 and 4/3. we now use
(219), (220), and (221) to obtain

tik < tij + tjk

(222)

this result shows that the three-junction in the model
under consideration occurs exothermically.

vii. networks of defects

the recent refs. [2022] have introduced investigations
concerning defect junctions and networks in supersym-
metric systems, and now we turn our attention to this
possibility. we consider junctions in the plane, which
may give rise to planar networks of defects. to imple-
ment this possibility we work in the (2, 1) space-time, in
the plane (x, y). we identify the axes (x, y) with the axes
(, ) of the space of congurations.

we illustrate this situation by considering, for instance,
the solutions we have obtained in sec. iv. they are
collected in eqs. (138)-(143) in (1,1) dimensions. in the
planar case they change to

concerns the case  > . in this case the minima give
rise to an array of defects of the form shown in fig. 2.
the second case concerns  = , and the third one  <
. they are shown in fig. 3, and in fig. 4, respectively.
the second case seems to give an intersection of four half-
defects, but this is not true since for  =  the two elds
decouple. thus, the apparent intersection of four half-
defects represents in fact the uninteresting case of two
non-intersecting defects.

the rst and third cases seem to be dual to each other,
since they are linked by the interchange   . this
duality is very much like the s  t duality that the dia-
grams depicted in fig. 2 and in fig. 4 remember. this
scenario excludes the self-dual case, where  = .

states are represented by v1 = 1, v2 = 2, v3 = 3, and v4 = 4,

defects, respectively.

the basic diagrams of fig. 2 and fig. 4 can be used to
generate planar networks of defects. we can generate a
network in the two following ways. the s-network, which

appears for / < 1, and the t-network, for / > 1.
they are depicted in fig. 5 and in fig. 6, in the case
of regular hexagonal networks. in the rst case we im-
pose that the triangle with vertices v1, v2, v4 is equilat-
eral. this gives / = 1/3. in the second case we impose
that the triangle with vertices v1, v2, v3 is equilateral. it
gives / = 3, the result we should expect from duality.
we notice that the rst (second) imposition subdivides
the distance between the horizontal (vertical) vacua into
three equal pieces, which is the condition for the forma-
tion of a network of regular hexagons.

the non-bps state, every three-junction may obey the
inequality tij < tjk + tki.

nbp s = t 1

we can consider the case where t1

bp s. this
gives  = 4  and the tensions degenerate to the single
value (2/3)||. the hexagonal cell is no longer regular.
the angle between the two bps states changes from  =
120 to  = 2 , where  is slightly lesser than 63.5 degrees.
we notice that we cannot make the tensions and angles
degenerate simultaneously, and this indicates instability
of the suggested networks.

we think of a planar network of defects. we notice
that a t-network means / > 1, and this allows hexag-
onal networks with two distinct bps states, having two
dierent tensions, t1
bp s, show-
ing that each three-junction of this t-network is at the
threshold of stablility. for / < 1, in the case of s-
networks, however, the situation is dierent since now
we must have two non-bps states to build the hexago-
nal cell. since the ratio / < 1 controls the energy of

bp s = (1/2)t1

bp s and t 1

eects that contribute to stabilise the network may
appear when we go beyond the classical level and intro-
duce the quantum corrections, since the quantum con-
tributions may modify the classical scenario. for in-
stance, in the case / > 1, in a t-network all the defects
are bps defects, and their energies or tensions are pro-
tected against receiving quantum corrections. on the
other hand, for / < 1, in the case of a s-network there
are non-bps states whose tensions are not protected and

18

may receive quantum corrections, changing the classical
value t1

nbp s, contributing to stabilize the network.

the rst model does not allow the appearence of a net-
work of planar squares, although squares can also ll the
plane. in our model this would require the z4 symmetry,
which is not eective in that model.

the fth model

the third model can also be used to generate three-
junctions. however, since the energies of the bps states
are dierent, each hexagonal cell gets dierent energy,
that depends on the vacuum state it represents. the
three-junction is at the threshold of stability, due to the
tensions ||, 3 ||, and 4 ||, that cannot strictly obey the
triangle inequality in this case.
leads to the model considered in
refs. [20,21]. in this case the three-junction is formed by
bps defects, and we can form an hexagonal array simi-
lar to the network obtained with the third model. here,
however, the three-junction is stable, because each leg
carries the same tension. but it does not generate a bps
network, because any two adjacent three-junctions must
have dierent winding to accomodate the three vacuum
states in the network, and this would imply that each side
of the hexagonal cell must be seen as bps and anti-bps,
simultaneously, frustrating and destabilizing the network
 see refs. [2022].

fig. 7. the regular hexagonal network of non-bps defects

suggested by the z3 model investigated in sec. iv.

we consider another model, investigated in sec. iv.
this model is dened by no superpotential, and the argu-
ment above is no longer valid. the z3 symmetry seems to
allow the presence of a network of defects, also in the form
of regular hexagonal array. in this network the energy of
the defect is given in eq. (144). the hexagonal network
that appears in this case is interesting, because the so-
lutions are explicitly known, form straight-line segments
joining the vacuum states, and have the same energy or

tension, (9/4)p27/8||. the z3 symmetry that appears

in the vacuum sectors is also eective in the sectors of
the topological defects. the inequality tik  tij + tjk is
strictly valid in this case, ensuring stability of the hexag-
onal network, as depicted in fig. 7.

viii. comments and conclusions

in the present work we have examined several mod-
els of coupled scalar elds. we have found some explicit
solutions, of the bps and non-bps type. we have also
investigated linear stability, checking the behavior of the
bosonic matter on the background of the bps and non-
bps defects. the bps states are solutions that obey
rst-order dierential equations, and the non-bps states
are not. the bps states engender the property of hav-
ing energy evenly distributed in the kinetic and potential
portions. however, in the systems of two coupled elds
that we have introduced, the non-bps states also engen-
der the same feature, as we have explicitly shown in this
work. the point here is that the non-bps states of the
systems of coupled elds are bps states of simpler sys-
tems, which are projections of systems of coupled elds
onto a single, specic eld direction.

the rst model is the model investigated in sec. iii a.
it presents several properties. in particular, it has a rich
bps sector, the sector that connect the minima (1, 0)
and (-1,0) by one-component and two-component bps
states. the two-component state describe a family of so-
lutions, parametrized by the ratio between the coupling
constants that specify the system. these one-component
and two-component states allow diverse applications, like
the applications as bag models in refs. [26], as defects in-
side defects in refs. [11,12,14,15], and in applications to
condensed matter, to polimeric chains having two rel-
evant degrees of freedom to represent the chain  see
refs. [4,36].

in applications in the form of bag models, in addition
to the models already introduced in refs. [29,30] we have
other possibilities, given by the rst, second and fourth
models introduced in sec. iii. these models dier from
the model considered in ref. [40], and we believe that
this new direction may shed further light on the issues
explored in that work. in particular, it seems that our
suggestions are easier to examine, and may oer an ana-
lytical understanding of the issues put foward in ref. [40]
under numerical investigations. we recall that the model
investigated in [40] is dened by a potential that can-
not be reduced to none of the models considered in the
present work.

in application to defect inside defect, much work was
already done in refs. [1115]. the natural extension is
now related to issues where one allows the presence of lo-
cal symmetries, as in the work on superconducting strings
[6]. in the rst model of sec iii a the z2  z2 symmetry
can be enlarged by enlarging each one of the two inde-
pendent symmetries. as we have already commented on
in sec. iii, we can for instance make the  eld complex,
in this case changing the z2z2 symmetry to z2ul(1),
if one also includes the abelian gauge eld. this opens
new possibilities, providing for instance a natural sce-
nario to the callan-harvey eect [39]. another possibil-
ity includes models that presents the z2  z3 symmetry,

19

which may provide scenarios for domain walls that nest
planar networks of topological defects. these issues are
presently under consideration, and we hope to report on
them in the near future.

in the case of supersymmetric systems, there are two
possibilities, that appear for potentials described by a
real superpotential w (, ), and for potentials described
by complex superpotentials w(). both systems may
support bps states, preserving the supersymmetry only
partially. we have shown this explicitly in the simplest
cases, showing that the bps states are in fact shorter
multiplets of the supersymmetric theory.

we have also commented on junctions of defetcs, and
the subsequent formation of networks of defects. in this
case we need to enlarge the spatial dimension from d = 1
to at least the d = 2 case. in the planar case, we have ex-
emplifyed how to get planar solutions from the unidimen-
sional kinks of the model. here we have considered three
models, the rst model of sec. iii a, the fth model of
sec. iii e, and another one, considered in sec. iv. they
are all dierent: the rst model admits a supersymmet-
ric extension of the type n = 1, and seems to admit no
stable network of defects, at least classically; the fth
model presents junctions that break 1/4 supersymmetry,
but it also seems to admit no stable network of defects.
the other model does not present a supersymmetric ex-
tension, but the defect solutions get even contributions
from the kinetic and potential portions of the energy, and
so they behave very much like bps states. this is crucial
for showing that the fusion of defects is a reaction that
occurs exothermically, and so the three-junction gener-
ates a stable network of defects.
