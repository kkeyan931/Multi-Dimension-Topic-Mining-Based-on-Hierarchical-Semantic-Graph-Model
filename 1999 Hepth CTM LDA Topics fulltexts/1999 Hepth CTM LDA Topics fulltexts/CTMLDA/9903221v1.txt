abstract

we make use of product integrals to provide an unambiguous mathematical
representation of wilson line and wilson loop operators. then, drawing upon
various properties of product integrals, we discuss such properties of these op-
erators as approximating them with partial sums, their convergence, and their
behavior under gauge transformations. we also obtain a surface product inte-
gral representation for the wilson loop operator. the result can be interpreted
as the non-abelian version of stokes theorem.

1 introduction

the notion of wilson loop [1, 2] provides a systematic method of obtaining gauge
invariant observables in gauge theories. its applications range over such diverse elds
as phenomenology and lattice gauge theories on the practical side and topological
gauge theories [3] and string theory [4] on the purely theoretical side. the impor-
tance of the wilson line as a parallel transport operator in the gauge independent
formulation of gauge theories has been emphasized by mandelstam [5], and further
developed by wu and yang [6]. more recently, in the context of the ads/cft cor-
respondence [7], an interesting connection between wilson loops in supersymmetric
gauge theories and membranes in supergravity theories has been suggested [8]. in

view of all these developments, it is imperative that wilson lines and wilson loops
be described within a well dened mathematical framework. the main purpose of
this work is to provide such a representation by means of product integrals. this will
permit us to give, among other things, two unambiguous proofs of the non-abelian
version of stokes theorem.

the product integral formalism has been used extensively in the theory of dier-
ential equations and of matrix valued functions [9]. in the latter context, it has a
built-in feature for keeping track of the order of the matrix valued functions involved.
as a result, product integrals are ideally suited for the description of path ordered
quantities such as wilson lines and wilson loops. in fact, they make precise what
one means by these concepts as well as what one means by the notion of path or-
dering in general. moreover, since the theory of product integrals is well developed
independently of particular applications, we can be condent that the properties of
wilson lines and wilson loops which we establish using this method are correct and
unambiguous.

among the important advantages of the product integral representation of wilson
lines, one is the manner in which it deals with convergence issues.
in the physics
literature, the exponential of an operator such as a wilson line is dened formally
in terms of its power series expansion. in such a representation, it will be dicult,
without any further elaboration, to establish whether the series converges and if so
how. in contrast to this, it is a straight forward matter to establish the criteria for the
convergence of the wilson line in its product integral representation. this is because
in such a framework the banach space structure of the corresponding matrix valued
functions is already built into the formalism.

another important advantage of the product integral formulation of the wilson
loop is that, at least for orientable surfaces, it permits a 2-surface representation for
it. based on the central role of stokes theorem in physics and in mathematics, it
is not surprising that the non-abelian version of this theorem has attracted a good
deal of attention in the physics literature [10]- [20]. the central features of the earlier
attempts[10]- [16] have been reviewed and improved upon in a recent work [17]. other
recent works on non-abelian stokes theorem [18, 19, 20] focus on specic problems
such as connement [19], zig-zag symmetry [20] suggested polyakov [21], etc. with
one exception [17], the authors of these works seem to have been unaware of a 1927
work in the mathematical literature by schlessinger [22] which bear strongly on the
content of this theorem. modern non-abelian gauge theories did not exist at the
time, and schlesingers work dealt with integrals of matrix valued functions and their
ordering problems. its relevance to wilson lines and wilson loops is tied to the fact
that in non-abelian gauge theories, the connection and curvature are matrix valued
functions. as a result, schlesingers work amounts to establishing the non-abelian
stokes theorem in two (target space) dimensions. by an appropriate extension and
reinterpretation of his results, we show that the product integral approach to the
proof of this theorem is valid in any target space dimension.

2

this work is organized as follows: to make this manuscript self- contained, we
review in section 2 the main features of product integration [9] and state without
proof a number of theorems which will be used in the proof of the non-abelian stokes
theorem and other properties.
in section 3, we express wilson lines and wilson
loops in terms of product integrals. in section 4, we turn to the proof of the non-
abelian stokes theorem for orientable surfaces. in section 5, we give a variant of this
proof. section 6 is devoted to convergence issues for wilson lines and wilson loops.
section 7 deals with two observables from the wilson loop operator. in section 8,
we study behavior of wilson lines and wilson loops under gauge transformations.
this is another instance in which the signicant advantage of the product integral
representation of these operators becomes transparent.

2 some properties of product integrals

the method of product integration has a long history, and its origin can be traced
to the works of volterra[9]. the justication for its name lies in the property that
the product integral is to the product what the ordinary (additive) integral is to the
sum. one of the most common applications of product integrals is to the solution of
systems of linear dierential equations. to see how this comes about, let us consider
an evolution equation of the type

y(s) = a(s)y(x), y(s0) = y0.

(1)

where s is a real parameter, and prime indicates dierentiation. when the quantities
y and a are ordinary functions, and y0 is an ordinary number, the solution is given
by an ordinary integral. on the other hand, if these quantities are matrix valued
functions arising from a system of, say, n linear dierential equations in n unknowns,
then the solution will be a product integral.

to motivate a more precise formulation of product integration, we start with a
simple example which exhibits its main features. let us suppose that all the matrix
valued functions that appear in the above equation are continuous on the real interval
[a, b]. then, given the value of y at the point a, i.e., given y(a), we want to nd
y(b). one can obtain an approximate value for y(b) using a variant of eulers
tangent-line method. let p = {s0, s1, . . . , sn} be a partition of the interval [a, b], and
let sk = sk  sk1 for all k = 1, . . . , n. in the interval [s0, s1], we approximate a(s)
by the constant value a(s1), solve the dierential equation with initial value y(a)
and get the approximate solution for y at s1:

y(s1)  ea(s1)s1 y(a).

in the next interval [s1, s2], using the above approximate value as input, and

replacing a(s) by a(s2), one nds

y(s2)  ea(s2)s2ea(s1)s1y(a).

3

proceeding in this manner we obtain the following approximate value for y(b):

y(b)  ea(sn)sn . . . ea(s1)s1 y(a) = p(a)y(a),

(2)

where

p(a) =

ea(sk)sk.

n

yk=1

we stress that the order of the exponentials on the right hand side of this equation
is important since the corresponding matrices do not commute in general.

since a is continuous on the compact interval [a, b], it follows that a is uniformly
continuous in that interval. this implies that for all k = 1, . . . , n the value a(sk) will
be close to the values of a(s) on [sk1, sk]. it is thus reasonable to suppose that if
the mesh (p ) of the partition p (the length of the longest subinterval) is small, the
above calculation results in a good approximation to y(b). then, we expect that the
exact value of y(b) is given by the natural limiting procedure

y(b) = lim

(p )0

p (a)y(a) 

x

ya

ea(s)dsy(a).

(3)

having identied the main ingredients which characterize the above construction,
we proceed to give a precise denition of the product integral [9]. we begin with the

denition 1 let a : [a, b]  cnn be a function with values in the space of complex
n  n matrices. let p = {s0, s1, . . . , sn} be a partition of the interval [a, b], with
sk = sk  sk1 for all k = 1, . . . , n.

(i) a is called a step function i there is a partition p such that a is constant on

each open subinterval (sk1, sk) for all k = 1, . . . , n.

(ii) the point value approximant ap corresponding to the function a and partition
p is the step function taking the value a(sk) on the interval (sk1, sk] for all
k = 1, . . . , n.

(iii) if a is a step function, then we dene the function ea : [a, b]  cnn by
ea(x) := ea(sk)(xsk1) . . . ea(s2)s2ea(s1)s1 for any x  (sk1, sk], for all k =
1, . . . , n and ea(a) := i.

after a number of intermediate developments, one arrives at the following fundamen-
tal theorem which can be taken as the starting point of product integration:

denition-theorem 1 given a continuous function a : [a, b]  cnn and a se-
quence of step functions {an}, which converge to a in the sense of l1([a, b]), then
the sequence {ean(x)} converges uniformly on [a, b] to a matrix called the product
integral of a over [a, b].

4

more explicitly, we have:

t he product integral of a over [a, b] =

ea(s)ds.

(4)

b

ya

now we are in position to enumerate some of the basic properties of product
integrals. the proofs of these assertions are given in reference [9]. let a : [a, b] 
cnn be a continuous function, and for any x  [a, b] let

f (x, a) :=

ea(s)ds

x

ya

(5)

denote the product integral from a to x. then, f satises the following integral
equation:

f (x, a) = 1 +z x

a

ds a(s)f (s, a),

(6)

where i = inn is the n  n unit matrix. the quantity f is also a solution of the
following initial value problem:

d
dx

f (x, a) = a(x)f (x, a), f (a, a) = i.

(7)

although product integrals can formally be dened for singular matrices, the above
denition makes sense if they are non-singular. this is true, e.g., when the matrices
form a group. then the determinant of the product integral is given by the following
theorem:

theorem 1 given the continuous function a : [a, b]  cnn, then for every x 
a ea(s)ds is non-singular and the following formula holds:

[a, b], the product integral qx

det  x
ya

ea(s)ds! = er x

a

tra(s)ds,

(8)

where tr stands for trace.

when the set of matrices {a(s) : s  [a, b]} is commutative, i.e.

[a(s), a(s)] =

0 s, s  [a, b], it is easy to show that

x

ya

ea(s)ds = er x

a

a(s)ds.

(9)

it is convenient to dene the product integralqb

a ea(s)ds also in the case when a  b.
b a(s)ds. to
obtain the analog of this for product integrals, we merely replace the additive
property with the corresponding multiplicative property:

it will be recalled that for ordinary (additive) integrals r b

a a(s)ds = r a

b

ya

ea(s)ds :=   a
yb

ea(s)ds!1

.

(10)

the additive property of ordinary integrals also provides a composition rule for them:
a a(s)ds. for product integrals, we have an analogous

r c
a a(s)ds + r b

composition rule [9]:

c a(s)ds = r b
ya
b (cid:16)r b

ea(s)ds =

another well known property of ordinary integrals is the dierentiation rule with
respect to the endpoints:
following theorem gives the corresponding rule for product integrals.

a a(s)ds(cid:17) = a(a). the

a a(s)ds(cid:17) = a(b) and

(12)

it is important to keep in mind the relative order of the a(x) and a(y) with respect
to the product integral.

fundamental theorem calculus: r b

the usual elementary way of computing ordinary integrals is by means of the
a f (x)ds = f (b)  f (a), where f is a primitive
function of f (f  = f ). to obtain the corresponding theorem for product integrals, we
start by dening the so called l-operation which is a generalization of the logarithmic
derivative, for non-singular functions:

denition 2 the l-derivative of a non-singular dierentiable function p : [a, b] 
cnn is given by:

lp (x) := p (x)p 1(x).

(13)

p (x) = qx

to demonstrate the usefulness of this operation, let us consider the product integral
a ea(s)dsp (a) =
a(x)p (x). then, from the above denition, we get (lp )(x) = a(x) (the derivative
of the primitive function is the original function). we are thus led to the analog of
the fundamental theorem of calculus for product integrals [9]:

a ea(s)dsp (a). from theorem 2, we have p (x) = a(x)qx

theorem 3 for a non-singular and continuously dierentiable (c 1[a, b]) function
p : [a, b]  cnn, we have

e(lp )(s)ds = p (x)p 1(a).

(14)

x

ya

the following elementary properties of the l-operation follow from its denition:

(lp 1)(x) = (p 1)(p 1)1 = (p 1p p 1)p = p 1(x)p (x),

(15)

and

l(p q)(x) = (p q + p q)q1p 1 = lp (x) + p (x)(lq(x))p 1(x).

(16)

we will rely heavily on the contents of the next three theorems in proving the non-
abelian version of stokes theorem. the proofs are given in reference [9].

p (x, y; ) = z x

(19)

to put the above description in its proper perspective, we note that instead of the
specic complex banach space l1([a, b], product integrals can be dened over more
general banach spaces. consider, e.g., a set b(x) of bounded linear operators over
a complex banach space, and let a : [a, b]  b(x) be an operator valued function.
it is possible to dene the product integral of a and establish the analogs of the
properties given above in this more general context. then, the standard topologies
(norm, strong, and weak) on the space of bounded linear operators play an important
role. moreover, the notion of lebesgue integrable functions used on l1([a, b]) space
above generalize naturally to boschner integrable functions [23]. for details we refer
again to [9].

3 the representation of wilson line and wilson

loop

as noted in the introduction, wilson lines and wilson loops are intimately related
to the structure of non-abelian gauge theories. to provide the background for using
the product integral formalism of section 2 to explore their physical properties, we
begin with the statement of the problem as it arises in the physics context. let m
be an n-dimensional manifold representing the space-time (target space). let a be

7

a (connection) 1-form on m. when m is a dierentiable manifold, we can choose a
local basis dx,  = 1, ..., n, and express a in terms of its components:

a(x) = a(x) dx.

we take a to have values in the lie-algebra, or a representation thereof, of a lie
group. then, with tk, k = 1, .., m, representing the generators of the lie group, the
components of a can be written as

a(x) = ak

(x) tk.

with these preliminaries, we can express the wilson line of the non-abelian gauge
theories in the form [24]

where p indicates path ordering, and c is a path in m. when the path c is closed,
the corresponding wilson line becomes a wilson loop [24]:

wab(c) = per b

a

a.

w (c) = peh a.

(20)

the path c in m can be described in terms of an intrinsic parameter , so that for
points of m which lie on the path c, x = x(). one can then write

where

a(x())dx = a()d,

a()  a(x())

dx()

d

.

it is the quantity a(), and the variations thereof, which we will identify with the
matrix valued functions of the product integral formalism.

let us next consider the wilson loop. for simplicity, we assume that m has
trivial rst homology group with integer coecients, i.e., h1(m, z) = 0. this insures
that the loop may be taken to be the boundary of a two dimensional surface  in
m. more explicitly, we take the 2-surface to be an orientable submanifold of m. it
will be convenient to describe the properties of the 2-surface in terms of its intrinsic
parameters  and  or a, a = 0, 1. so, for the points of the manifold m, which lie
on , we have x = x(,  ). the components of the 1-form a on  can be obtained
by means of the vielbeins (by the standard pull-back construction):

thus, we get

v 
a = a x ().

aa = v 

a a.

the curvature 2-form f of the connection a is given by

f = da + a  a =

1
2

f dx  dx.

8

the components of f on  can again be obtained by means of the vielbeins:

fab = v 

a v 

b f.

we note at this point that we can construct the pulled-back eld strength fab in
another way, as the the eld strength of the pulled-back connection aa. it is easy to
check that these two results coincide, insuring the consistency of the construction.

we want to express the wilson loop operator in terms of product integrals [25].
to achieve this, we begin with the denition of a wilson line in terms of a product
integral. consider the continuous map a : [s0, s1]  cnn where [s0, s1] is a real
interval. then, we dene the wilson line given above in terms of a product integral
as follows:

a(s)ds

s0

per s1

s1

ea(s)ds.



ys0

anticipating that we will identify the closed path c over which the wilson loop is
dened with the boundary of a 2-surface, it is convenient to work from the beginning
with the matrix valued functions a(,  ). this means that our expression for the
wilson line will depend on a parameter. that is, let

a : [0, 1]  [0, 1]  cnn,

(21)

where [0, 1] and [0, 1] are real intervals on the two surface  and hence in m.
then, we dene a wilson line

p (, 0;  ) =



y0

ea1(; )d

 per 

0

a1(; )d

.

(22)

in this expression, p indicates path ordering with respect to , while  is a parameter.
to be able to describe a wilson loop, we similarly dene the wilson line

q(; , 0) =



y0

ea0(; )d 

 per 

0

a0(; )d 

.

(23)

in this case, the path ordering is with respect to  , and  is a parameter.

to prove the non-abelian version of the stokes theorem, we want to make use
of product integration techniques to express the wilson loop operator as an integral
over a two dimensional surface bounded by the corresponding loop. in terms of the
intrinsic coordinates of such a surface, we can write the wilson loop operator in the
form

(24)

(25)

where, as mentioned above,

w (c) = peh aada

,

a = (, ) ;

a = (0, 1).

9

the expression for the wilson loop depends on the homotopy class of paths in m to
which the closed path c belongs. we can, therefore, parameterize the path c in any
convenient manner consistent with its homotopy class. in particular, we can break up
the path into segments along which either  or  remains constant. the composition
rule for product integrals given by eq. (11) ensures that this break up of the wilson
loop into wilson lines does not depend on the intermediate points on the closed path
which are used for this purpose. so, inspired by the typical paths which are used in
the actual computations of wilson loops (see for example [8]), we write

w = w4 w3 w2 w1,

(26)

in this expression, wk, k = 1, .., 4, are wilson lines such that  = const. along w1
and w3, and  = const. along w2 and w4.

to see the advantage of parameterizing the closed path in this manner, consider

the exponent of eq. 24 :

aada = a0d + a1d.

(27)

along each segment, one or the other of the terms on the right hand side vanishes.
 = 0 = const.. as a result, we get
for example, along the segment [0, ], we have 
for the wilson lines w1 and w2, respectively,

w1 =



y0

ea1(;0)d

 per 

0

a1(;0)d

= p (, 0; 0),

and



(28)

(29)

w2 =

y0

ea0(; )d 

 per 

0

a0(; )d 

= q(; , 0).

when the 2-surface  requires more than one coordinate patch to cover it, the
connections in dierent coordinate patches must be related to each other in their
overlap region by transition functions [6]. then, the description of wilson loop in
terms of wilson lines given in eq.
(26) must be suitably augmented to take this
complication into account. the product integral representation of the wilson line
and the composition rule for product integrals given by eq. (11) will still make it
possible to describe the corresponding wilson loop as a composite product integral.
for deniteness, we will conne ourselves to the representation given by eq. (26).

it is convenient for later purposes to dene two composite wilson line operators

u and t according to

u(,  ) = q(; , 0) p (, 0;  ),

t (;  ) = p (, 0;  ) q(0; , 0).

using the rst of these, we have

w2 w1 = u(,  ).

10

(30)

(31)

(32)

similarly, we have for the two remaining wilson lines

and

w3 = p 1(, 0;  ),

w4 = q1(0; , 0).

from the eq. (31), it follows that

w4 w3 = t 1(,  ).

(33)

(34)

(35)

appealing again to eq. (11) for the composition of product integrals, it is clear that
this expression for the wilson loop operator is independent of the choice of the point
(,  ). in terms of the quantities t and u, the wilson loop operator will take the
compact form

w = t 1(;  )u(;  ).

(36)

4 non-abelian stokes theorem

as a rst step in the proof of the non-abelian stokes theorem, we obtain the action
of the l-derivative operator on w :

l w = l [t 1(,  )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0)].

(37)

using the denition of the l-operation given by eq. (13), noting that p (, 0; 0) is
independent of  , and carrying out the l operations on the right hand side (rhs),
we get

l w = l t 1(,  ) + t 1(,  ) [ l q(; , 0) +

+q(; , 0)(l p (, 0; 0))q1(; , 0)]t (,  ).

(38)

simplifying this expression by means of eqs. (13) and (15), we end up with

l w = t 1(,  )[a0(,  )  l t (,  )]t (,  ).

(39)

next, we prove the analog of theorem 3, which applies to an elementary wilson line,
for the composite wilson loop operator dened in eq. (24) and made explicit in eq.
(26).

theorem 7 the wilson loop operator dened in eq. (26) can be expressed in the
form



w =

y0

et 1(, )[a0(, )l t (, )]t (, )d 

.

(40)

11

to prove this theorem rst we note from the denition of the l operation that the
right hand side (rhs) of this equation can be written as

rhs =



y0

e[t 1(; )a0(; )t (; )t 1(; ) 

  t (; )]d 

.

noting that t 1 t = l t , we can use theorem 5 to obtain

rhs = t 1(;  )

ea0(; )d 

t (; 0).



y0

moreover, making use of the dening eq. (23), we get

(41)

(42)

rhs = t 1(;  ) q(; , 0) p (, 0; 0) q(; 0, 0) = t 1(;  ) u(;  ).

(43)

the last line is clearly the expression for w given by eq. (36).

finally, we want to express the wilson loop w in yet another form which we state

as:

theorem 8 the wilson loop operator dened in eq. (26) can be expressed as a
surface integral of the eld strength:

w =



y0

0

er 

t 1(; )f01(; )t (; )dd 

(44)

where f01 is the 0-1 component of the non-abelian eld strength.

to prove this theorem, we note that




[t 1(,  )a0(,  )t (,  )] = t 1(,  ) [a0(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )]] t (,  ).
(45)

moreover,




{t 1(,  ) (l t (,  )) t (,  )} = t 1(,  ) a1(,  )t (,  ).

(46)

it then follows that



 {t 1(,  )[a0(,  )  l t (,  )]}t (,  )}

= t 1(,  )[ 

 a0(,  )  

 a1(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )]}t (,  )

= t 1(,  )f01(,  )t (,  ).

(47)

the last step follows from the denition of the eld strength in terms of the connection
given above

f0 1 :=




a0(,  ) 




a1(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )].

(48)

12

integrating eq. (47) with respect to , we get

t 1(,  )[a0(,  )  l t (,  )]}t (,  )
t 1(;  )f1 0(;  )t (;  )dd .

= z 

0

(49)

we thus arrive at the surface integral representation of the wilson loop operator:

w =



y0

0

er 

t 1(; )f1 0(; )t (; )dd 

.

we note that in this expression the ordering of the operators is dened with respect
to  whereas  is a parameter. recalling the antisymmetry of the components of the
eld strength, we can rewrite this expression in terms of path ordered exponentials
familiar from the physics literature:

w = p e

dabt 1(; )fab(; )t (; ),

(51)

2r

where dab is the area element of the 2-surface. despite appearances, it must be
remembered that  and  play very dierent roles in this expression.

5 a second proof

to illustrate the power and the exibility of the product integral formalism, we give
here a variant of the previous proof for the non-abelian stokes theorem. this time
the proof makes essential use of the non-trivial theorem 6. we start with the form
of w given in eq. (36) and take its derivatives with respect to  :

w


=  q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0;  )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) +

+q1(0; , 0) p 1(, 0;  )q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0) +
+q1(0; , 0)p 1(, 0;  ) q(; , 0)p (, 0; 0).

(52)

here, we have made use of the fact that p (, 0; 0) is independent of  . as a
preparation for the use of theorem 3, we start with eq. (13) for w and use theorem
1

l w =

w


w 1 = t 1(;  ) [a0(;  )  p (, 0;  )a0(0;  )p 1(, 0;  ) 

 p (, 0;  )p 1(, 0;  )] t (;  ).

(53)

now we can use theorem 6 to evaluate the derivative of the product integral with
respect to the parameter  :

 p (, 0;  ) = z 

0

dp (, ;  ) a1(;  )p (, 0;  ).

(54)

13

then, after some simple manipulations using the dening equations for the various
terms in eq. (53), we get:

t 1(;  ) p ( )p 1( )t (;  ) = z 

0

dt 1(;  ) a1(;  )t (;  ).

(55)

using theorem 2 and the fact that p (0, 0;  ) = 1, we can write the rest of eq. (53)
as an integral too:

t 1(;  )[a0(;  )  p (, 0;  )a0(0;  )p 1(, 0;  )]t (;  ) =

= q1(0; , 0)[p 1(, 0;  )a0(;  )p (, 0;  )  a0(0)]q(0; , 0) =
0 d p 1(, 0;  )( a0(,  ) + [a0(,  ), a1(,  )])p (, 0;  ).

(56)

= r 

combining eqs. (53), (55), and (56), we obtain:

l w =

w


w 1 = z 

0

dt 1(,  )f01(,  )t (,  ).

(57)

using theorem 3, we are immediately led to eq. (50) which was obtained by the
previous method of proof.

there are two reasons for the relative simplicity of this proof over the one which
was given in the previous section. one is due to the use of dierentiation with respect
to a parameter according the theorem 6. the other is due to the use of eq. (13) and
theorem 3 for the composite operator w . in the rst proof, the use of this theorem
for w was not assumed. its justication for using it in the second proof lies in the
composition law for product integrals given by eq. (11).

6 convergence issues

the denitions of wilson lines and wilson loops as currently conceived in the physics
literature involve exponentials of operators. the standard method of making sense
out of such exponential operators in the physics literature is through their power
series expansion:

a(x)dx =

a

per b



xn=0

1
n!

p z b

a

a(x)dx!n

,

(58)

where a typical path ordered term in the sum has the form

1
n!

p(z b

a

a(x)dx)n := z b

a

dx1z x1

a

dx2 . . .z xn1

a

dxn a(x1)a(x2) . . . a(xn).

(59)

without additional specications, such a power series expansion is purely formal,
and it is not clear a priori that the series (58) is well dened and convergent. in-
deed, in previous attempts [10]- [20] at proving the non-abelian stokes theorem, the
convergence of such series has been taken more or less for granted.

14

one important advantage of our product integral approach is that, without the
need for further input, we can show the convergence of the path ordered exponentials
precise, without any further eort by using the established properties of product
integrals. 1 they will enable us to prove that the series of partial sums converges
uniformly to the product integral. the proof is contained, as a special case, in the
following two theorems valid for all product integrals. the detailed proofs of these
theorems are given in reference [9].

theorem 9 given the continuous function a : [a, b]  cnn, and given x, y  [a, b],
x ||a(s)||ds. also let j0(x, y) = i, and for n  1 dene iteratively

x a(s)jn1(s, y)ds. then for any n  0 the following holds:

let l(x, y) = r y
jn(x, y) := r y

||

y

yx

ea(s)ds 

jk(x, y)|| 

1

(n + 1)!

n

xk=0

|l(x, y)|n+1el(a,b).

(60)

this estimate is uniform for all x, y in the interval [a, b]. one of the consequences of
this estimate is the content of the next theorem.

theorem 10 with a and jk(x, y) as in theorem 9, we have, in the same notation,

y



ea(s)ds =

jk(x, y).

(61)

yx

xk=0

the series on the right hand side of this expression converges uniformly for any x, y 
[a, b].

to give a avor of the proofs involving product integrals we will include the proof

of this theorem. according to theorem 9 we have:

||

y

yx

ea(s)ds 

n

xk=0

jk(x, y)||  m

1

(n + 1)!

|l(b, a)|n+1  0, as n  

(62)

this follows immediately since, e.g., by stirlings formula, the asymptotic behavior
of the factorial function is roughly n!  nn as n  . therefore, xn
 0 as
n  . q.e.d.

n(cid:17)n
n!  (cid:16) x

7 physical observables

from the wilson loop operator, one can obtain physical quantities in a variety of
ways. the most familiar one is its trace which gives the c-number wilson loop or the
wilson loop observable:

trwr(c) = trpe

dabt 1(; )fab(; )t (; ).

(63)

1for example, to estimate a general term in the expansion (58) to show the norm convergence, we
dont need to restate the elementary fact that the space of matrices of given rank over the complex
numbers form a banach space.

1

2r

15

the subscript r in this expression refers to the particular representation of the gen-
erators.

another invariant associated with an operator (a matrix) is its determinant. from
its product integral representation, the determinant of the wilson loop operator is
given by

after some straight forward manipulations, this can be expressed in the form

2r
det w = etr 1

dabt 1(; )fab(; )t (; ).

(64)

(65)

detw = e

trdabfab(; ).

1

2r

the generators of simple lie groups can be represented by traceless matrices so that
for these groups tr fab = 0, indicating that det w = 1. this is not surprising since the
wilson loop operator is a group element, and for group elements with determinant
one this result follows trivially. for non-simple groups such as u(1) and the products
thereof the trace reduces to the trace of commuting elements of the algebra with
non-zero trace. the corresponding subgroup is commutative, there is no ordering
problem, and the surface representation of wilson loop operator reduces to that of
the (abelian) stokes theorem.

8 the gauge transforms of wilson lines and wil-

son loops

under a gauge transformation, the components of the connection, i.e.
potentials, transform according to [24]

the gauge

a(x)  g(x)a(x)g1(x)  g(x)g(x)1,

the components of the eld strength (curvature) transform covariantly:

f(x)  g(x)f(x)g1(x).

(66)

(67)

using the product integral formalism, we want to derive the eect of these gauge
transformations on wilson lines and wilson loops.

let us start with the wilson line dened by eq. (22). under the gauge transfor-

mation (66) this quantity transforms as

p (, 0;  ) =



y0

ea1(; )d





y0

e[g(; )a1(; )g1(; )g(; ) g1(; )]d

.

(68)

by eq. (13), g(;  )g1(;  ) = lg(;  ). thus, we have for the gauge trans-
formed wilson line



y0

e[g(; )a1(; )g1(; )+l g(; )]d

.

(69)

16

moreover, we use theorem 4 and recall from theorem 3 that q

g(;  )g1(0;  ). then, the gauge transform of p (, 0;  ) will take the form

0 el g(; )d =

g(;  )g1(0;  )



y0

eg(0; )a1(; )g1(0; ).

(70)

finally, using theorem 7 and 8 one can readily see that the constant terms in the
exponents can be factored out from the product integral so that we get

p (, 0;  )  g(;  )p (, 0;  )g1(0;  ).

in the physicists notation, the result can be stated as

a(x)dx

a

per b

 g(b)(cid:18)per b

a

a(x)dx(cid:19) g(a),

(71)

(72)

thus, we have an unambiguous proof of how the wilson line transforms under gauge
transformations. this is of course consistent with the role of the wilson line as a
parallel transport operator. for a closed path, the points a and b coincide. as a
result, the corresponding wilson loop operator transforms gauge covariantly.

for consistency, we expect that the surface integral representation of the wilson
loop also transforms covariantly under gauge transformations. to show this explicitly,
we note from eq. (50) that in this case we need to know how the operator t (,  )
transforms under gauge transformations. to this end, we note that the wilson line
q(; , 0) given by eq. (23) transforms as

q(; , 0) =



y0

ea0(; )d 

 g(;  )q(; , 0)g1(; 0).

(73)

the transform of the composite wilson line t (,  ) given by eq. (31) follows imme-
diately:

t (;  ) = p (, 0;  ) q(0; , 0)  g(;  )t (;  )g1(0; 0).

(74)

as expected from the composition rule given by eq. (11), the product of two wilson
lines transforms as a wilson line.

from the above results, it is straight forward to show that the surface integral

representation of wilson loop transforms as

w 



y0

e

g(0;0)(cid:16)r 

0

t 1(; )f10(; )t (; )dt(cid:17)g1(0;0)

.

(75)

as in the case of wilson line, the constant factors in the exponent factorize, so that
under gauge transformations the wilson loop transforms covariantly, i.e.,

w  g(0; 0)



y0

0

er 

t 1(; )f10(; )t (; )dt

g1(0; 0).

(76)

17

this result strengthens our condence in the self consistency of our formalism. in the
physics notation, this transformation law takes the form

a(x)dx

pehc

 g(a)(cid:16)pehc

where a is a point on the loop c.

a(x)dx(cid:17) g1(a),

(77)

an important consequence of the gauge covariance of the wilson loop operator
(63) is gauge invariant. since
is that the wilson loop observable given by eq.
this observable is the trace of the wilson loop operator, the result follows from the
invariance of trace of a product of operators under cyclic permutation of the operators.

9 concluding remarks

the identication of wilson lines and wilson loops of non-abelian gauge theories
with product integrals allows for the possibility of extracting physical consequences
from these objects in a consistent and mathematically well dened manner. although
many of the properties of wilson lines and wilson loops have been discussed [10]-
[20] from various, more intuitive, points of view, there are two issues associated with
these operators with respect to which their product integral representations have a
decided advantage. one is the existence issue discussed in section 6, and the other is
the supersymmetric generalization of these notions [26]. we are optimistic that the
present work will help ll the gap in connection with these as well as other issues.
