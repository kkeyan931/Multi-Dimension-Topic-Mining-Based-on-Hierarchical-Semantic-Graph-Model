abstract

in this paper, we extend our earlier one loop analysis to two loops and give

a simple diagrammatic description for the retarded greens functions at nite

temperature, in terms of forward scattering amplitudes of on-shell thermal

particles. we present a simple discussion, which can be easily generalized to

any eld theory, of the temperature dependent parts of the retarded two and

three point functions in scalar eld theory and qed. as an application of our

result at two loops, we show how the infrared singularities in the thermal part

of the retarded photon self-energy, cancel in qed2 in the limit of vanishing

electron mass.

i. introduction

in recent years, there has been an increased interest in the study of eld theories at

nite temperature for a variety of reasons [15]. this has led to a better understanding

of the formalism of such theories at nite temperature. in particular, we understand now

that, in addition to the conventional imaginary time formalism, physical phenomena at nite

temperature can equally well be described by the real time formalism where the time variable

is not traded in for the temperature of the system [68].

the brute force calculations in eld theories at nite temperature are quite tedious,

particularly, in the real time formalism where there is a necessity to double the degrees of
freedom of a theory which leads to (2n  1) independent causal amplitudes at n-th order.
therefore, it is quite important to nd simple calculational methods in such theories for

them to be useful. furthermore, even though there exist various formal arguments showing

the equivalence of the two distinct formalisms [912] (imaginary time and real time), it is

still necessary to check explicitly that the two formalisms give the same physical quantities,

at least in lower orders.

amplitudes calculated in the imaginary time formalism naturally give rise to retarded

(advanced) amplitudes with appropriate analytic continuation to the minkowski space. in

an earlier paper [13], we gave a very simple diagrammatic representation of such amplitudes

(retarded) in the real time formalism, at one loop, which is calculationally quite trivial and

which also explicitly veries the agreement of the two formalisms to this order. in this paper,

we would like to extend our earlier results to two loops. namely, we would give a simple

diagrammatic description of the retarded two loop amplitudes at nite temperature in the

real time formalism which is calculationally much simpler (than a brute force calculation)

and which also explicitly veries the agreement of the imaginary time and the real time

formalisms up to two loops. this description expresses the temperature dependent part of

the retarded green functions in terms of forward scattering amplitudes for on-shell particles

of thermal medium. these amplitudes are multiplied by the appropriate statistical factors

2

and integrated over the three-momenta of the thermal particles.

the paper is organized as follows. in section ii, we analyze the temperature dependent

part of the retarded self-energy for the 4 theory up to two loops in the real time formalism

and give a simple diagrammatic representation for it. we explicitly evaluate the retarded

self-energy and show that it coincides with the results obtained earlier using the imaginary

time formalism. in section iii, we analyze the temperature dependent part of the retarded

photon self-energy in qed at two loops and obtain a simple diagrammatic representation

for it. we also analyze briey and nd a simple diagrammatic representation for the tem-

perature dependent retarded three point function at two loops in qed. (the diagrams for

the amplitudes, in this theory, are more like those in the 3 model.) since our discussion is

quite general, it is easy to extend these results to the temperature dependent part of any

retarded n-point amplitude at two loops (for any bosonic or fermionic theory). in section

iv, we discuss, as an example of our method, how the infrared mass singularities in the

retarded photon self-energy, cancel at nite temperature for the schwinger model [14] at

two loops. finally, we present a brief conclusion in section v.

ii. retarded self-energy in 4 theory

let us consider the theory of a self-interacting real scalar eld described by the la-

grangian density

as is well known, at nite temperature, in the real time formalism (we will follow the closed

time path formalism although everything can be carried over to thermo eld dynamics

equally well), one needs to double the degrees of freedom, which leads to a 2  2 matrix
structure for the propagator

gab(q) = g(0)

ab (q) + g()

ab (q)

a, b =

here g(0)

ab represents the zero temperature propagator while g()

is the on-shell, temperature

dependent part of the propagator and, in the closed time path formalism, all the four

components of the temperature dependent part of the propagator are identical. explicitly,

where nb(|q0|) stands for the bosonic distribution function (and the propagator really is
igab). following ref. [13], we introduce the following diagrammatic representation for the

two parts of the propagator

and the temperature dependent part of the self-energy, at one loop, is easily obtained to

be (this also coincides with the retarded self-energy to this order) the forward scattering

amplitude for a single on-shell thermal particle

in going beyond one loop, we note that there are two kinds of diagrams for the self-energy

at two loops in this theory, namely, the penguin and the rising sun diagrams. let us analyze

each class of the diagrams (which involve three internal propagators) separately. for the

penguins, it is straightforward to check that all the diagrams for the retarded self-energy

where all three internal propagators are cut cancel, namely,

+

= 0.

this follows trivially from the fact that the cut propagators are the same, independent of

their thermal indices, as is clear from eq. (3) and the fact that the vertices with the 
thermal index have a negative sign relative to those with the + thermal index. some of the

diagrams with two internal cut propagators can also be easily seen to add up to zero

+

= 0.

however, not all the diagrams with two internal cut propagators add up to zero and all the

diagrams with a single cut propagator do contribute. thus, all the temperature dependent

seen to be

in the retarded self-energy, all the diagrams with three internal cut propagators add up to

zero

which, again, follows trivially from the fact that all the cut propagators are the same inde-

sign. the diagrams with two internal cut propagators as well as a single internal cut prop-

agator, however, all contribute, so that

is nonzero (diagrams with permuted cuts must also be considered).

we next recall that a cut propagator is an on-shell propagator and hence can be thought

of as a cut open external line representing an on-shell thermal particle (intuitively, one can

think of it as a real particle of the medium). therefore, we can combine the non-vanishing

penguin and the rising sun diagrams to represent the temperature dependent part of the

retarded self-energy at two loops as

where we have used the convention that the cut lines on the lower/upper half come from

the same propagator. furthermore, gr represents the usual retarded propagator, namely,

gr(q) =

1

q2  m2 + iq0

(12)

and the denition of the retarded vertex functions are as given in ref. [13]. thus, we see that

the temperature dependent part of the retarded self-energy at two loops has two kinds of

terms - terms quadratic in the statistical factor as well as ones linear in the statistical factor

(remember that each cut propagator carries a statistical factor). furthermore, the terms

6

quadratic in the statistical factor corresponding to two cut lines can be thought of simply

as the forward scattering amplitude of two on-shell thermal particles. the terms which are

linear in the statistical factor or have a single cut propagator, on the other hand, correspond

to the forward scattering amplitudes of a single on-shell thermal particle with all possible

one loop self-energy and vertex corrections where the corrections are retarded and have to

be evaluated at zero temperature.

all these terms are rather simple to evaluate, by doing the energy integrals with the help

of the delta functions in eq. (3). one then obtains from the diagrams which depend on the

external momentum, that the relevant temperature dependent part at two loops is given by

(14)

such a form of the retarded thermal self-energy is rather convenient, particularly for the

calculation of its imaginary part which is related to the plasma damping rate. the above

result agrees with the one obtained by parwani in ref. [15], after analytic continuation from

the imaginary time formalism. in this way, one can establish an explicit equivalence between

the two formalisms up to two loops much like in the one loop case.

iii. retarded greens functions in qed

let us next consider the qed theory described by the lagrangian density

l = 

1
4

ff  + (i/  m + ea/),

(15)

where a is the photon eld, f the eld strength tensor and  is the dirac eld. apart

from a matrix factor and the replacement of (nb) by the fermionic distribution function

7

nf , the structure of the electron propagator is similar to that in eqs. (2) and (3). how-

ever, let us note that, for the purpose of our discussion, the actual form of the propagator

is irrelevant, all that is crucial is that the temperature dependent part of any propagator

(bosonic or fermionic) is the same for all the thermal indices in the closed time path formal-

ism. (consequently, our discussion will be quite general without restrictions to a particular

theory.) assuming that the largest time vertex is the one conected with the external line p,

the retarded thermal self-energy of photons at one loop is given by the forward scattering

amplitude of a single on-shell thermal particle

(16)

note that the propagator with momentum owing outwards from the largest time vertex is

retarded while the one with momentum owing towards this vertex is advanced (see ref. [13]

for details).

in going beyond one loop, we note that there are again two classes of diagrams - ones

containing overlapping divergences and the others with the structure of one loop diagrams

with a self-energy correction for one of the internal propagators. each of these classes of

diagrams contains ve internal propagators. as before, it is easy to check that the sum

of all diagrams containing ve cut propagators, four cut propagators as well as three cut

propagators individually vanish which follows from the fact that the cut propagators are

the same irrespective of their thermal indices and that vertices with  thermal index have
an extra negative sign. some of the graphs with two internal cut propagators also cancel,

but not all of them. and all the graphs with a single cut propagator contribute. adding

them all up and remembering that a cut propagator is on-shell and hence can be thought of

as an external thermal particle, we again nd that the temperature dependent part of the

retarded self-energy, at two loops, can be written as

here, all other diagrams obtained by the permutation of external lines are to be understood.

once again, it is clear that the temperature dependent part of the two loop retarded self-

energy contains terms which are quadratic in the statistical factors as well as ones which are

linear in the statistical factor. the terms which are quadratic in the statistical factor, come

from diagrams with two cut propagators each of which can have a simple description of a

forward scattering amplitude for two on-shell thermal particles. on the other hand, those

9

which are linear in the statistical factor, come from diagrams with a single cut propagator

and can be described in terms of forward scattering amplitudes of a single on-shell thermal

particle with all possible one loop self-energy and vertex corrections. as in the last section,

we note that these corrections are retarded and are to be evaluated at zero temperature.

this is, indeed, a very simple description of the two loop retarded self-energy and much

simpler to evaluate than the brute force calculation would entail.

let us evalulate next the temperature dependent part of the retarded three point func-

tion, at two loops order (although the three photon vertex vanishes in qed by charge

conjugation, our analysis does also apply to a theory like qcd, where the three gluon ver-

tex is non-zero). without going into too much detail, let us note that there will be two

classes of diagrams contributing to this - one containing diagrams which can be thought of

as a vertex correction to the one loop three point function and the other with graphs which

contain a one loop self-energy correction in one of the internal propagators of the one loop

three point vertex function. the diagrams in each of these two classes of graphs consist of six

internal propagators and it is straightforward to check that the sum of graphs with six cut

propagators, ve cut propagators, four cut propagators as well as three cut propagators in-

dividually vanish. some of the graphs with two cut propagators also add up to zero, but not

all. furthermore, all the graphs with a single cut propagator contribute. the non-vanishing

diagrams can again be given a simple graphical representation by remembering that a cut

line is on-shell and can be thought of as an external thermal particle (of the medium). we

thus get, for example, the graphical equations

in the above forward scattering amplitudes, all other relevant permutations of the external

lines are to be understood. here, we have assumed that the vertex with external momentum

p1 corresponds to the largest time vertex. then, all propagators with momentum owing

towards this vertex are advanced, whereas the propagators with momentum owing outward

from the largest time vertex are retarded. once again, we note the familiar pattern. the

temperature dependent part of the retarded three point function, at two loops, consists of

12

two types of terms. the ones which are quadratic in the statistical factor correspond to sim-

ple forward scattering amplitudes of two on-shell thermal particles (of the medium) whereas

the ones which are linear in the statistical factor correspond to the forward scattering am-

plitude of a single thermal on-shell particle with all possible one loop self-energy and vertex

corrections. such retarded one loop corrections, which are calculated at zero temperature,

may contain ultraviolet divergences and must be renormalized as usual.

from the analysis of these two loop amplitudes so far, it is quite straightforward to nd a

simple, general diagrammatic description of the two loop retarded n-point amplitudes. the

temperature dependent part of a general two loop retarded n-point amplitude can be written

in terms of two classes of diagrams. the rst class would involve simple forward scattering

amplitudes for two on-shell thermal particles (two cut lines) and would correspond to terms

which are quadratic in the statistical factor. the second class of diagrams would involve

forward scattering amplitudes of a single on-shell thermal particle (one cut line) with all

possible one loop self-energy and vertex corrections, where these corrections are retarded and

are to be evaluated at zero temperature.

iv. application

in this section, we will study the qed2 model at nite temperature and, as an appli-

cation of the general method, show how the infrared mass singularities of the temperature

dependent retarded photon self-energy cancel at two loops in the limit of vanishing fermion

mass. this gauge theory, which is described by the lagrangian density (15) in 1 + 1 dimen-

sions, is well behaved in the ultraviolet region. for simplicity, we will work in the feynman

gauge although the choice of gauge is immaterial, since the nite temperature results are

gauge invariant in the schwinger model.

if we look at the photon self-energy in this theory, then, from our discussions, we recognize

that the temperature dependent part of the retarded self-energy, at one loop, can be written

in terms of the forward scattering amplitude of a thermal on-shell fermion as shown in

13

eq. (16). the two diagrams give identical contribution, since inverting the direction of

the internal momentum ow interchanges the advanced and retarded propagators. unlike

in higher dimensions, in 1 + 1 dimensions, there is only one transverse structure for the

polarization tensor at nite temperature. furthermore, there are special identities for the

dirac trace in 1 + 1 dimensions which make the one loop calculation quite simple and give

here, we have identied the space components of p and k with p1 and k1 respectively,

nf is the fermionic distribution function and k = q(k1)2 + m2. clearly, this vanishes as
m  0.

in going beyond one loop, let us note that the infrared mass singularities in the retarded

photon self-energy come from the graphs with a one loop self-energy correction in the internal

fermion propagator, particularly when the internal photon propagator is cut (irrespective of

whether there are other cuts in the diagram). consider, for example, the following set of

thermal diagrams

here,  is an infrared regulating photon mass which has to be set to zero at the end. once

we have isolated this factor, the photon momentum can be safely set to zero in the rest of

the diagrams.

14

as we have seen earlier, at two loops, only graphs with two cut propagators or a single cut

propagator can give a non-vanishing contribution. a little bit of analysis shows that in graphs

with a single cut on the photon propagator, which as shown in fig. (17-g) contain a retarded

fermion loop calculated at zero temperature, the infrared divergent contributions cancel. the

graphs with two cut propagators, shown in the set (21), can be expressed in terms of the

forward scattering amplitudes (a), (b) and (c), indicated in the graphical equation (17). to

evaluate these, we note that in consequence of special kinematic relations which hold in

1 + 1 dimensions, there will again appear in the numerator an overall factor m2 (compare

with eq. (20)). one may naively think that also in this case, this factor would be sucient

to ensure the vanishing of the whole contribution, in the limit m  0. however,such an
argument would be fallacious at two loop order, where the infrared mass singularities of the

theory begin to manifest. in this case, there are individual contributions whose denominators
behave like 1/m2 as m  0. such terms would then give rise to contributions proportional
to i(t /), which are independent of m. therefore, a more complete analysis is necessary in

order to ascertain the behavior of the theory in the limit of vanishing fermion mass.

to this end, we note that the infrared behavior of the diagrams in the set (21) is de-
termined by the regions k  0 and q, m  p (we assume that p2 6= 0). then, in the
corresponding forward scattering amplitudes (17-a, b, c)), we expand the retarded and ad-

vanced propagators into a sum of principal values and delta functions. adding all such

contributions, it turns out that the infrared divergent part of the above diagrams is given

by

(25)

performing the q0 integration and neglecting terms of order (m/t ), one nds after some

calculation that eq. (25) becomes

(26)

it is interesting to note how the individual terms, which would give infrared divergent

contributions independent of m, cancel in the complete amplitude. a similar behavior also

occurs when the photon propagator is uncut.

the above results show that, in the limit m  0, the infrared mass singularities in the
retarded photon self-energy cancel at nite temperature, at two loops. due to the presence

of infrared divergences associated with a massless photon, one cannot directly conclude that

contributions like those on the right-hand side of (26) necessarily vanish as m  0. on the
other hand, if we resum the theory, we know that the photon becomes massive so that we
can replace the infrared regulator  by the photon mass in the theory, namely m = e/.

we then see that all such contributions would indeed cancel in the limit m  0, which is
consistent with our earlier analysis [13]. in view of this behavior of the infrared domain and

due to the presence of an overall factor of m2 in all other regions, the complete thermal

amplitudes in qed2 will therefore reduce, as m  0, to those of the massless schwinger
model. presumably, this occurs because in the transition from a massive to a massless

fermion, the number of fermionic degrees of freedom is conserved. therefore, as far as

the physical (advanced/retarded) amplitudes are concerned, it appears that in the limit of

vanishing fermion mass, the thermal qed2 theory may describe a free gas of massive bosons

at nite temperature.

16

v. conclusion

in this paper, we have extended our earlier one loop results on the calculation of tem-

perature dependent parts of retarded greens functions to two loops. we have analyzed the

temperature dependent part of the retarded two and three point functions in scalar eld

theory and in qed. we have given a simple representation of these functions in terms of

forward scattering amplitudes of on-shell thermal particles. this is calculationally much

easier than brute force calculations and leads to the same result as calculated from the

imaginary time formalism, thereby establishing an explicit agreement between the two for-

malisms up to this order. from these analyses, we nd that the temperature dependent part

of the retarded greens functions, at two loops, can have a simple description in terms of two

classes of diagrams. the rst one consists of simple forward scattering amplitudes of two

on-shell thermal particles, corresponding to terms quadratic in the statistical factor. the

second class, characterized by terms which are linear in the statistical factor, involves for-

ward scattering amplitudes of a single on-shell thermal particle. these contain all possible

one loop self-energy and vertex corrections, which are retarded and have to be calculated

at zero temperature. as an application of these results, we have shown how the infrared

singularities in the temperature dependent part of the retarded photon self-energy cancel at

two loops in qed2, in the limit of vanishing fermion mass.

we expect that the above representation of retarded greens functions at nite temper-

ature can be generalized for any theory to n-loop order. namely, these functions may be

described in terms of forward scattering amplitudes of n on-shell thermal particles, ampli-

tudes of n  1 on-shell thermal particles with all possible retarded one loop self-energy and
vertex corrections evaluated at zero temperature, and so on. such a representation leads to

a simple and systematic way of calculating retarded (advanced) thermal amplitudes, which

is rather useful especially in the case of non-abelian gauge theories [16].
