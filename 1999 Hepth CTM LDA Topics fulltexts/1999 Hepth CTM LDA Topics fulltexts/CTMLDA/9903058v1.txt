abstract

we consider the entropy problem of ads3 black holes using the conformal

eld theory at the horizon. we observe that the supersymmetry is enhanced

at the horizon of massless ads3 black hole. this allows us to determine the

vacuum of the modular invariant conformal eld theory to be the ns-ground

state (which corresponds to ads3 spacetime). this is smoothly related to

the r-ground state (corresponding to massless black hole) by a spectral ow,

which can be understood as a superconformal transformation.

the microscopic origin of the entropy of black holes has been a challenging problem in

quantum gravity since its original formulation [1]. it has proven to be a fertile ground to

test the ideas of string theory [2], and the conformal eld theory on d-branes [3,4] has been

quite successful. however, in the d-brane approach, the geometric picture was not so clear

because it was formulated in the weak coupling limit. the fact that it can be extended

to near-extremal cases [5] has been taken with a grain of salt, since the d-branes are bps

objects. better understanding of the bekenstein-hawking entropy could follow from the

relationship of the btz black hole [6] in 2+1 dimensions and higher dimensional black holes

in string theory. this possibility is due to the observation that the near horizon geometry

of higher dimensional black hole congurations can be related to that of btz black hole by

some duality transformations [7]. this makes the study of btz black hole quite important.

since black holes in 2+1 dimensions have asymptotic geometry of anti-de sitter (ads) space,

some kind of holographic principle might hold a key to the problem of black hole entropy, in

light of recent developments in ads/cft [8]. however, at least for the case of btz black
hole, we need not resort to the full string theory on ads3  s3  m 4 to solve the entropy
problem.

in this paper, we consider the entropy problem of ads3 black holes using the conformal

eld theory at the horizon (to be precise we mean the apparent horizon). first we observe

that the supersymmetry is enhanced at the horizon of massless ads3 black hole. this

allows us to determine the vacuum of the modular invariant conformal eld theory to be

the ns-ground state (which corresponds to ads3 spacetime). this is smoothly related to

the r-ground state (corresponding to massless black hole) by a spectral ow, which can be

understood as a superconformal transformation.

let us now describe the btz black hole [6]. there are no curvature singularities for the

solution so that the btz black hole solution came as a surprise. the metric of black hole

of mass m and angular momentum j is

ds2 = n 2dt2 + n 2dr2 + r2(d + n dt)2,

the asymptotic symmetry of ads3 is generated by two copies of the virasoro algebra with

generators ln, n  integer, with central charge c = 3l/2g [9]. although the bulk degrees
of freedom are nondynamical, we have a nontrivial dynamical conformal eld theory (cft)

on the boundary. such conformal symmetry is also found on the horizon of the black hole

[10].

let us sketch the current status of study on btz black hole. applying the cardys

formula [11] for the asymptotic growth of states for cft, one can count the number density

of the microscopic degrees. using this carlip obtained the black hole entropy from cft

on the horizon [10]. the derivation was based on the fact that gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions

can be formulated as topological chern-simons theory [12], and the boundary dynamics at

the horizon is a cft described by the sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) wess-zumino-witten model.
however, the diculties with this approach were spelled out recently [13]. carlips original

work [10] is awed by the fact although he resorts to large k limit, where k is the level

number of the sl(2, r) kac-moody algebra, k actually is not so large, on shell, at the point

hr  r+k which is the most relevant to the black hole entropy in his calculation. this was
remedied with a simpler boundary condition for the horizon, and he obtained the central

charge without the details of the boundary cft, and derived entropies even for higher

dimensional black holes [14]. similar results were also found by solodukhin [15].

on the other hand, strominger obtained the entropy from the cft at the asymptotic

boundary of ads3 black hole [16]. this very simple and elegant observation, however, cannot

tell what the boundary degree of freedom is, and whether the central charge is the eective

central charge ce = c  24min or not, just as in the case of carlips approach [14]. (see
also [15].) here min is minimum value of the conformal dimension of the cft. we will

elaborate on this point later.

applying the regge-teitelboim method [17], banados et al. obtained the algebra satised

3

by the global charges without the details of boundary theoryi [18]. there is also an explicit

derivation using a boundary system coupled to the bulk geometric background [19]. however,

as is noted by carlip [13], the central charge is modied to be ce = 1 and is too small to

account for the black hole entropy.

there have been many related works due to the recent keen interest of ads/cft duality

of maldacena [8]. for example the works of martinec [20] takes the ads/cft seriously and

argues that liouville eld theory (derived from chern-simons gravity) is just an eective

theory corresponding to the macroscopic description, and cannot account for the black

hole entropy. there is also a stringy interpretation of the entropy [21]. despite these

conformal eld theoretic approaches, it has already been pointed out that none is completely

satisfactory [13].

in this paper we revisit the cft approach to the black hole entropy problem. in deriving

the cardys formula used to calculate the entropy, the following two ingredient are quite

essential. first, the partition function of a cft must have modular invariance,   1/ ,
where  is the modular parameter. secondly, to evaluate the partition function using saddle

point approximation, the value of the central charge has to be shifted to ce = c  24min,
whenever the ground state eigenvalue min of l0 does not vanish [22]. here we stress that

min should be evaluated on the plane, i.e. l0 is the zero mode of the stress energy tensor

on the plane, even though the partition function is that of a cft on a cylinder [11].

getting the correct number for min is the source of the diculty in the problem. ex-

tracting the exact information on the conformal data (c, min) of the cft starting from

a black hole geometry is usually quite dicult. one way to obtain min easily is to make

use of supersymmetry. in the neveu-schwarz(ns)-sector of a superconformal eld theory,

min = 0 always, and ramond(r)-sector has value of c/24. ads3 geometry is identied as

the bosonic backgrounds of (1,1)-type ads supergravity [23]. to be more specic, we have

the following cases: (i) the ads3 vacuum(global ads3 spacetime) has four killing spinors

which are antiperiodic (ns-sector), (ii) a massless black black hole has two periodic killing

4

spinors (r-sector), (iii) a massive extremal black hole has one periodic killing spinor (r-

sector). this can be easily seen by analyzing the killing spinor equations for each geometry:

d =


2l

.

(3)

4 ab

in the above d =  + 1
 ab is the covariant dierential form with respect to the spin
connection ab,  = 1 and {a, b} = 2ab. two values of  is possible because there are
two independent representations for cliord algebra in three spacetime dimension. naively

one expects that the massless black hole corresponds to the ground state of the boundary

cft, and this looks reasonable because ads vacuum (m = 1/8g) is disconnected from
the black-hole spectrum (m  0), although ads vacuum has the lowest energy.

however, this choice of the ground state gives a wrong answer for the bekenstein-hawking

entropy, while using the ads vacuum instead gives the correct answer. if we restrict the

spectrum solely to the black holes, the corresponding cft seems to be restricted to the r-

sector only. we know very well that we cannot have a modular invariant theory restricting

to the r-sector only, because the contribution to the partition function from the r-sector

transforms into that of ns-sector under some modular transformations [24].

furthermore the operator product expansion (ope) algebra for superconformal theory

is such that

[r]  [r]  [ns],

[ns]  [ns]  [ns],

[r]  [ns]  [r].

(4)

this means that we cannot restrict the cft to the r-sector only. moreover, the identity

will come out from the ope algebra eventually. if we examine this more carefully, we note

the ads vacuum is not quite disjoint from the black hole spectrum, but is connected via

singular point particle geometries between them (see preprint version, hep-th/9204099 of

[6]). this becomes quite clear as we consider the boundary geometries.

actually one can create massless black hole out of ads3 by head-on collision of two

massless particles [25]. in this case mass gap, m = 1/8g, between the ads3 spacetime

and massless black hole exactly matches with the energy of those two particles. the spatial

5

geometry of a point particle has a conical singularity [26]. here the conical singularity is not

a serious problem. one can resolve the singularity by replacing the matter distribution over

a small region for the point particle. in fact, in the high energy scale, this point particle

structure can be resolved. the most important thing is that the string cannot see this

orbifold xed point as singular.

now we look into the boundary conformal structure starting from its geometry. the

metric on the r = r0 surface for the geometry generated by the point particle source of mass
m = 2/8g in the bulk 1 is
dt2

l2 + d2! ,

   + 2,

ds2 = r2

0 <   1,

(5)

from which we note the decit angle 2(1). in the above we have redened (1+l2/r2
as t. it is convenient to work in the euclidean scheme.

0)1/2t

ds2

e = r2

0(cid:16)d 2 + d2(cid:17) ,

(6)

where  = it/l is the euclidean time. one can focus on the r = r0 region by rescaling
0 = d 2 + d2. although the boundary topology is s1, the angular geometry
ds2  ds2/r2
has a decit angle. we can map this cylindrical geometry with decit angle to a conical

one, i.e. the boundary conformal cone, by the following exponential conformal mapping

w = e +i( w = e i):

ds2

cone = dwd w  r22(dr2 + r2d2),

(7)

where w is the holomorphic coordinate on the cone. in the above we have introduced the
polar coordinates r = (e )1/ and  = / to show the conical structure, where 0  r <
w = z/ we get
,
to the conformal plane:

   + 2. with another conformal transformation w(z) = z/,

ds2

cone = z1 z1dzdz.

(8)

1here we have negative mass because we set the massless black hole case to have m = 0

6

so  = 1, which is the plane geometry, corresponds to the ads vacuum and the singular

limit   0 approaches to the massless black hole. the mass parameter of the point particle
is a continuous parameter which interpolates these two limits.

the stress energy tensor of the cft on the cone is obtained from the following conformal

transformation with the schwarzian derivative:

tplane(z)  z2(1)tcone(w) 

c
24z2 (  1)( + 1).

(9)

thus the conformal weight of a primary on the cone is related to that on the plane as

follows (with similar expressions for l0):

(lcone)0 = (lplane)0 +

c
24

(  1)( + 1).

(10)

here we note that lcone interpolates lcylinder (for   0) and lplane (for  = 1). for spinning
particle case, we can follow similar step. in this case l0 and l0 is shifted dierently to have
l0  l0 6= 0.

there is another thing which connects these two limit. this is the spectral ow between

these two states in the corresponding boundary cft. however, to realize spectral ow one

actually needs an extended supersymmetry. in fact, one can show that at the black hole

horizon, there is supersymmetry enhancement. to see this let us consider the killing spinor

equation for the massless black hole case.

where x = t0/l + 2. due to the -dependent terms, only two out of these four

killing spinors survive upon the identication    + 2. however near the horizon the
-dependent terms drop out because they are relatively small compared to the other 1/r

terms, and all four solutions survive enhancing supersymmetry. such an enhancement is

not a surprising thing as we can see in similar cases discussed before [27]. actually this

enhancement of supersymmetry at the boundary cft is consistent with the spacetime

supersymmetry. so if the horizon is where the boundary cft (for the microscopic degrees

of freedom for btz black holes) is located, then we can solve the entropy problem. the

(1,1)-type ads supergravity in the bulk gives rise to (2,2) supersymmetric horizon cft.

one can ask, when the mass of the black hole is zero, if the boundary cft makes any

sense, because the horizon is just a point. it is not a problem because the btz black hole

coordinate patch cannot cover the whole region of ads3. in fact, r = 0 point is the null

surfaces in the global coordinates for ads3, deliminating the poincare region [28]. below the

black hole spectrum, that is to say, for the ads3 spacetime and conical geometries of point

particles, one can take the boundary at any point with nite radius. this is so because the

boundary geometry looks the same regardless of the value of the radius we have.

the isomorphism, which maps the r-sector to the ns-sector in the (2,2) supersymmetric

cft is the spectral ow [29]. we want to show that the spectral ow in fact is a symmetry

transformation, i.e. superconformal transformation in superspace. to see this we write down

the super stress-energy tensor in superspace formalism as follows:

j (z, +, ) = j(z) + +g(z) + g+(z) + i+t (z).

the superconformal transformation of the stress energy tensor is given by

j (z, +, )  (d+ d +) j (z, +, ) +

ik

s(z, z),

(14)

(15)

where d = 
derivative [30]. z = (z, +, ) is the complex n = 2 supercoordinate.

z are the superderivatives and s(z, z) is the n = 2 super-schwarzian
in general, the

 +  

superconformal transformation on a super riemann surface is given as

8

z = f (z),

+ = ++(z)+ + +(z),

 = +(z)+ + (z),

(16)

with the following superconformal condition:

++ = qf ei,

 = qf ei,

+ = + = 0,

(17)

for some functions f (z) and (z). conventional conformal transformation corresponds to

the case of  = 0. the prime denotes the derivative with respect to z. under this the

components of super stress-energy tensor transform as

denoting the right hand sides as j(z), g

(19)

whole expression as

j(z) = j0(z) 
t(z) = t0(z) + 2j0(z) 
where k = c/3 was used. we note here j0(z), g

0 (z) and t0(z) are nothing but the standard

superconformal transformation. rephrasing j as ij/2 and  as i ln z, we are led to the
spectral ow map for the n = 2 superconformal symmetry. this means that the spectral

ow can be understood as a kind of superconformal transformation. the twist operator

which connects the ns-vacuum and r-vacuum is not just a tool here but is in the set of

primary operators. (the same interpretation is expected for the spectral ow for the higher

extended superconformal symmetry.) the true vacuum turns out to be the ns-vacuum.

this makes ce = c, whatever theory the horizon cft is.

another advantage of the spectral ow is that we can understand the the black hole

creation (r-state) from particle (ns-state) collisions in terms of ope. the particle collision

would be ope of two ns-states, and it seems that making r-state is impossible. however

with the spectral ow, we can actually make

9

[ns]  [ns]  [ns]+

(20)

if  +  = 1 actually [ns]1 = [r]. the cardys formula, which counts the physical degrees

of freedom, must be invariant under the symmetry, and thus under the spectral ow. rel-

evance of spectral ow for black hole entropy was discussed in ref. [31], where the unitary

representation of n = 2 superconformal algebra [32] is used. description of the spectral

ow in terms of charged particles coupled to the chern-simons gauge theory was discussed

in dierent setting [33].

to calculate the black hole entropy from this horizon cft, we have to know the central

charge c and the conformal weight  of the horizon state of the black hole. we use the

results recently obtained by carlip [14].

c =

3r+
gt

,

 =

r+t
8g

,

(21)

where  is the inverse hawking temperature and t is an arbitrary periodicity, which does

not aect the result for the entropy. dierently from the asymptotic cft, the central charge

c depends on the inner and outer horizon radius r, r+ of the black hole. dierent black

hole gives dierent cft on the horizon. another remarkable thing for the horizon cft is

that the central charge c of the right moving mode vanishes in the case. the same features

were also found in [15].

in three dimension, one can determine the arbitrary periodicity t as follows. given a

black hole of mass m and angular momentum j , the conformal data are xed as in (21).

each horizon state of conformal weight (, ) contributes to the bulk mass m and angular

momentum j. although the energy of a horizon state needs not be equal to the bulk mass

they must be proportional to each other;  +  = ml + , where  and  are dimensionless

constants to adjust the dierent scalings and dierent base points of the energy respectively.

one can also nd the relation between the angular momentum of the horizon state and
the bulk angular momentum j as    = j. the energy gap beween the r-vacuum and
ns-vacuum of the horizon cft matches with the mass gap between the massless black hole

and the ads vacuum.

(22)

which tells us c = 3l/g and /t = l/r+. therefore the ambiguity of the periodicity t is

concerned with the dierent energy scalings of the horizon cft and the bulk ads geometry.

from carlips results and some known facts about the ads vacuum one can determine 

and  completely, therefore x the periodicity.

the central charge c together with the conformal weight ( m , j) =  results in the correct

statistical entropy s  2r+/4g.

lastly, we would like to comment on the success of the string theory which gives the

correct entropy, regardless of the delicate arguments we had to give in supergravity theory.

the successes which specify the microscopic structure are those works making use of the

bps arguments. at least in the weak coupling regime, they point out that the microscopic

structure resides on the world volume of d-branes.

in this weak coupling region, it is

meaningless to say the bulk geometry. for the d1-d5-kk case, the eective world volume

theory is the (4,4) supersymmetric sigma model on the symmetric product of k3 [3]. owing

to the extended supersymmetry, the cardys formula can be applied at any point of ground

state under the spectral ow as long as both r-sector and ns-sector are fully included in

the calculation. fortunately for this world volume theory, there is no reason to pick out the

r sector ground state as the true ground state.

there are several works which seem to produce the correct central charge and entropy

using the ads/cft correspondence, also without referring to the points we have resolved

above. in fact, one needs to address the same question of the true ground state for this

scheme also so far as the microscopic structure is not specied. (even though the microscopic

11

structure is not specied, one can determine the ground state using supersymmetry.) in the

calculation of the two point function of stress energy tensor, it has been a priori assumed

that the ground state is the ns-sector since the poincare coordinates (without identication)

are usually used. however, if one neglect the 3-sphere part of ads3s3, the supersymmetry
on the asymptotic boundary is just n = 1 for the r sector ground state because there is

no supersymmetry enhancement on the asymptotic boundary dierently from the horizon.

therefore spectral ow is not expected in this asymptotic cft. one has to resort to other

method to say that the ns vacuum is the true vacuum of the asymptotic cft.
