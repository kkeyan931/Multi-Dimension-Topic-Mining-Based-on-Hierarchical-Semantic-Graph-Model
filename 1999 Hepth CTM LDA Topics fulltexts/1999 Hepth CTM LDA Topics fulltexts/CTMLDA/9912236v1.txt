abstract

we explicitly construct the so(d, d) transformations of ramond-ramond eld
strengths and potentials, along with those of the space-time supersymmetry
parameters, the gravitinos and the dilatinos in type-ii theories. the results
include the case when the so(d, d) transformation involves the time direction.
the derivation is based on the compatibility of so(d, d) transformations with
space-time supersymmetry, which automatically guarantees compatibility with
the equations of motion, and involves constructing the spinor representation
of a twist that an so(d, d) action induces between the local lorentz frames
associated with the left- and right-moving sectors of the worldsheet theory.

1 introduction

the o(d, d) transformations in string theory, also referred to as the narain group or
the generalized t-duality group, have played an important role in understanding toroidal
compactications and dualities, as well as in constructing classical solutions to the low-
energy equations of motion [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. the action of the o(d, d) group on the
ns-ns sector elds (the graviton, the antisymmetric tensor eld and the dilaton), which
are all assumed to be independent of d coordinates, has been known for a long time. in
the worldsheet formalism, the o(d, d) action on these elds can be obtained either by
a canonical transformation [2, 3], or by gauging appropriate isometries in a non-linear
-model [7].
in the framework of the low-energy eective theory, one can derive the
transformation of the elds by writing the eective action in a manifestly o(d, d) invariant
form [3, 4, 5, 6].

deriving the o(d, d) transformation of the ramond-ramond elds has turned out
to be more complicated. since the fundamental string does not carry ramond-ramond
charges, the usual nsr formalism worldsheet methods cannot be used. in [8] the equa-
tions of motion in iia and iib supergravities were used to derive the transformation of the
ramond-ramond potentials under the single t-duality subgroup of o(d, d) which inter-
changes the two theories. however, the generalization of this approach to the full o(d, d)
group (or to its so(d, d) part if we do not want to interchange iia and iib theories) has
not been straightforward. in [9] it was pointed out that in toroidal compactications of
type-ii theories the components of r-r potentials, when arranged in representations of
the lorentz group of the uncompactied space so(9  d, 1), ll up weyl spinor repre-
sentations of the so(d, d) group. this suggestion was implemented in [10] for a specic
case of t 3 compactication of type-iia theory and generalized to t d compactications
in [11]. in this approach, one constructs so(d, d) weyl spinors out of combinations of
r-r potentials and the ns-ns 2-form. in terms of these spinors, the kinetic energy terms
for the r-r elds in the low-energy eective action (ignoring the self-duality constraint
on the type-iib 5-form) can be written in a manifestly so(d, d) invariant from.
it is
expected that the construction can be extended to include the chern-simon terms as well
as the self-duality of type-iib 5-form eld strength. although this formally proves the
so(d, d) invariance of the r-r kinetic energy terms in the low-energy eective action, so
far it has not been possible to extract from this the transformation of r-r potentials and
eld strengths under generic non-trivial so(d, d) transformations. in the case of iia on
t 3, the transformations of the r-r potentials have also been studied in the framework
non-commutative super yang-mills compactications of matrix theory [10, 12]. this is
also based on constructing weyl spinor representations of so(3, 3), though the results
obtained could be matched only to the gij  0 limit of the string theory results.

in this paper, we determine the so(d, d) transformations of the ramond-ramond eld
strengths and potentials using a more straightforward approach. in the process we also

2

determine the so(d, d) transformations of the space-time supersymmetry parameters and
r-ns elds (the gravitinos and the dilatinos). our approach is based on the compatibility
of so(d, d) transformations with space-time supersymmetry. as a result, our derivation
automatically guarantees the so(d, d) covariance of the equations of motion and the in-
variance of the associated low-energy eective actions, including the chern-simon terms
and the self-duality constraints, since in type-ii theories all these are determined by su-
persymmetry. the method we use is a generalization of the one used in [13] for a single
t-duality transformation and can be summarized as follows.
in type-ii supergravity
theories, every spinor index originates either in the left-moving or in the right-moving
worldsheet sector of the underlying string theory. on the other hand, it has been known
that in at space non-trivial o(d, d) transformations correspond to transforming the left-
moving and right-moving parts of the space-time coordinates by independent lorentz
rotations; +x  r +x, x  s x [4, 5]. this feature also survives in curved
backgrounds, x  q x, though now q are space-time dependent through their
dependences on the background elds [14, 15]. thus, one can regard a non-trivial o(d, d)
transformation as twisting the left- and the right-moving sectors of the worldsheet theory
with respect to each other. by supersymmetry, this translates to transforming the spinor
indices originating in the two worldsheet sectors by two dierent o(d, d) induced local
lorentz transformations. in particular, we may choose the spinor index associated with,
say, the right-moving sector to remain unchanged, and only transform the one associated
with the left-moving sector. this determines the basic o(d, d) action on the space-time
spinors as well as on the ramond-ramond elds which can be combined into bispinors.
the exact form of the transformation is xed by the o(d, d) covariance of the supersym-
metry transformations. to make this structure behind the transformation of the r-r
elds manifest, it is important that the supersymmetry transformations are written in
terms of variables that appear more natural in string theory. note that in this approach
we only have to construct the spinor representation of the o(d, d) induced local lorentz
twist which is essentially an element of o(d  1, 1)  o(9, 1), and not that of the full
o(d, d) group. the explicit construction we give here is for the so(d, d) part of the group
as the single t-duality case has been discusses in detail in [13].

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe our notation and briey
review some aspects of the o(d, d) transformations that will be needed in the rest of the
paper.
in particular we emphasize that the transformed theory contains two dierent
vielbeins that are related by a local lorentz transformation. this is interpreted as a twist
between the local lorentz frames associated with the left- and right-moving sectors of the
worldsheet theory. in section 3 we argue that this local lorentz twist should be absorbed
by the spinors and hence construct its spinor representation. we discuss the at-space
t-duality limit in some detail to highlight some important features of the spinor repre-
sentation. in section 4, we obtain the so(d, d) action on the supersymmetry variation
parameters, the gravitinos and the dilatinos. in section 5, we use the transformation of
the space-time spinors along with the explicit construction of the spinor representation
of the local lorentz twist to obtain the so(d, d) action on the ramond-ramond eld

strengths. then by a simple argument we show that the transformations of the r-r
potentials have exactly the same from as those of the eld strengths. after restricting to
type-iia on t 3, and taking the gij  0 limit, we reproduce the results obtained in the
ncsym formalism. we end this section by writing an so(d, d) covariant form for the
r-r kinetic energy terms in the low-energy eective action. our conclusions are summa-
rized in section 6. appendix a outlines the steps for the derivation of some equations
needed in section 4, and appendix b contains some -matrix results.

2 preliminaries

in this section, we will describe our notation and conventions and then briey recall the
action of the so(d, d) group on the massless ns-ns sector elds for later reference.

notation : we denote the 10-dimensional space-time coordinates by x m (m = 0, . . . , 9),
and assume that all elds are independent of the d coordinates x i, for i = 0,   d  1.
for the sake of generality, we have assumed that these coordinates also include time.
the remaining 10  d coordinates are denoted by x  on which the elds may depend.
a, b = 0,   , 9 are the local lorentz frame indices. we use the symbols g, b, q, s, r to
denote 10  10 matrices and g,b,q,s,r to denote their d  d blocks labeled by i, j.
parameterization of so(d, d) : it is well known that the low-energy eective action for
the massless ns-ns elds which are restricted to be independent of x i, is invariant under
an so(d, d) group of transformations1[3, 4, 5, 6]. not all elements of this group have a
non-trivial action on the background elds [4]: in fact, out of its d(2d  1) elements, a
d2-dimensional subgroup corresponds to general linear coordinate transformations gl(d)
and another d(d  1)/2-dimensional subgroup corresponds to constant shifts in bij, both
of which are manifest symmetries of the low-energy eective action. clearly, to describe
the action of these elds on the elds, we do not really need the o(d, d) formalism. only a
d(d1)/2-dimensional subgroup so(d1, 1)so(d1, 1)/so(d1, 1) acts non-trivially
on the background elds and therefore, in this paper, we focus on the transformations
generated by this subgroup. let s,r  so(d1, 1). we choose a basis in which elements
of so(d  1, 1)  so(d  1, 1)  so(d, d) take the form

note that the transformations are embedded in 1010 matrices and we use a hat to distin-
1at this stage, the actual invariance group is o(d, d), but since elements with negative determinant

interchange type-iia and type-iib theories, we restrict ourselves to so(d, d).

guish between the so(d1, 1) invariant metric m n appearing above, and the minkowski
metric ab of the local lorentz frame. the case s = r corresponds to a coordinate ro-
tation which is already included in gl(d). the non-trivial transformations are therefore
parameterized by so(d  1, 1) so(d  1, 1)/so(d 1, 1) which is obtained by restrict-
ing o such that its only independent parameters are contained in s1r (for example, by
setting s = 1d). in the following we may simply write so(d, d), understanding that we
are only interested in its non-trivial elements.

action on ns-ns backgrounds : the action of the so(d, d) group on the metric gm n and
the antisymmetric tensor eld bm n is most conveniently written in terms of a matrix
m which, in our conventions for the parameterization of the group elements, is given by
[3, 4, 5, 6]

(1k + 110) g1 (1k t + 110) (1k + 110) g1 (1k t  110)
(1k  110) g1 (1k t + 110)

the standard form r d2km n +x m x n . the ns-ns elds g, b and  then transform

here, k = g + b and the sign of bm n is chosen such that the worldsheet action has

according to

fm = o m ot ,

e2e = e2qdet eg/ det g .

using (2) in (3), one can check that the transformation of the metric g can be written in
two equivalent forms [16],

where the matrices qm

2 [(s + r)  (s  r)1(g  b)] .

q = 1

q+ = 1

these matrices will play an important role in our discussions later. their relevance can
be understood better by noting that the canonical transformation that implements the
n x n , where
we have ignored the worldsheet fermion contributions. on the worldsheet fermions, the

induced local lorentz twist : in order to obtain the transformations of spinors and r-r
elds, we also need the transformation of the vielbein ea
m . from now on, for convenience,
we will use the symbol e for the inverse vielbein em
a and will refer to both e and e1 as
the vielbein. from equation (4) it is evident that a priori one can transform the vielbein
in two dierent ways [15],

a as originating in either the left-moving

the appearance of the two vielbeins ee() can be easily understood in terms of the world-
or the right-moving sector of the worldsheet theory. it then transforms to either ee(+) or
ee(), depending on its worldsheet origin. this is consistent with the action of so(d, d)
on the worldsheet variables as described above and also with the fact that the world-
sheet parity    which interchanges the two worldsheet sectors, also interchanges the
variables (s, r, b) and (r, s,b), and hence ee(+) and ee().
it is then clear that an so(d 1, 1) so(d 1, 1)/so(d 1, 1) transformation twists
the local lorentz frame originating in the left-moving worldsheet sector with respect to the
one originating in the right-moving sector by an amount a
b. although all ns-ns sector
elds and their supersymmetry variations are insensitive to , in general this twist can
be absorbed by the ramond sector elds, leaving the two local lorentz frames untwisted.
in fact, as we will see in section 4, this is dictated by the requirement of consistency with
supersymmetry which shows that the spinor representation of the induced twist a
b enters
in the transformations of space-time spinors and ramond-ramond elds under non-trivial
so(d, d) action. however, before that, we rst construct the spinor representation of the
induced twist  in the next section.

the factor  in (11) can now be absorbed in the transformation of space-time spinors.
note that this only aects spinor indices that originate in the left-moving ramond sector
of the worldsheet theory, leaving the ones associated with the right-moving ramond sector
unchanged. we will see in the next section that this is in fact dictated by supersymmetry.
this situation is quite reminiscent of the construction of ramond sector boundary states
in the presence of a background worldvolume gauge eld studied in [17]. below, we
explicitly construct the spinor representation .

in general, a

b is an element of the local lorentz group so(9, 1) associated with the
left-moving sector of the worldsheet theory. therefore, it can be parameterized by an
antisymmetric matrix aab as

 = ( + a)1(  a) ,

a =  (1  ) (1 + )1 .

(13)

then, the antisymmetry of a implies that t  = . for the time being we assume
that 1 +  is non-singular so that the above parameterization is well dened. we will
later come back to the singular case. the spinor representation can now be constructed
in terms of a as

 = [det( + a)]1/2  (

(14)

here a,s,r and d denote the d  d blocks of a,s,r and  labeled by i, j = 0,   d  1,
and the (ij) indices on the right hand side are raised by the matrix inversion. substituting
for the determinant prefactor as well, the spinor representation takes the form

(15)

(16)

here, [d/2] stands for the integer part of d/2 so that, for example, the summation contains
only one term for d = 2, 3 (involving i1i2) and two terms for d = 4, 5 (involving i1i2 and
i1i2i3i4). in particular, it does not contain  as should be the case. the factor det q
is the same quantity that appears in the transformation of e2 and  det g. this will be
important in the derivation of the transformation rules of the ramond-ramond elds as
well as in showing the invariance of the low-energy eective action. the remaining factor
has the explicit form

det(q + q+) = det[(1d + s1r) + (1d  s1r)d b] ,

(17)

where we have used the fact that dets = 1. as will be shown below, this factor is
essential for getting the correct t-duality limit in cases with bij = 0, which serves as an
easy consistency check for the results. note that both this factor and aij depend only
on b and have no dependence on g and other components of b. furthermore, note that,
as expected,  depends on the combination s1r alone and equals identity for s = r,
corresponding to an so(d)  gl(d) transformation on the bosonic backgrounds which
does not aect the spinor index. one can easily restrict these formulae to the case when
x i do not contain the time coordinate by replacing d by 1d.

the singular limits and flat-space t-duality : when det(1 + ) = 0, the parameteriza-
tion in (13) becomes singular, though in the spinor representation , the singular terms
cancel out and one is left with a well dened expression. this case is important as it
includes t-duality transformations when bij = 0 and provides an easy non-trivial check
for the correctness of our results.

to see this more clearly, let us consider, as an example, the d = 4 case in the at
background g = , b = 0, which remains unchanged by the transformation. we assume

8

all the four x i to be spatial coordinates and set s = 1. then,  = r. t-duality
transformations along the four coordinates x i correspond to taking r = 14, where r
is the 4  4 block of r. in this case the spinor representation is already known (see, for
example, [18]) and is simply given by  = 1234. on the other hand, in the formalism
here, this transformation clearly corresponds to a singular case since det(1 + ) = 0. one
can easily see that the correct spinor representation is reproduced by going away from the
t-duality point and parameterizing r as

.

(18)

r =

cos 
sin 
 sin  cos 

o

the singular cases then correspond to either  =  or  =  or both. one can now

easily evaluateqdet(q+ + q), which tends to zero in the singular limits, and aij (some
components of which tend to  in the singular limits) and get a well dened  as

by setting  =  =  we reproduce the correct  for t-dualities along all the four
coordinates, while setting only one of the angles to  corresponds to t-dualities along
two coordinates, combined with a non-trivial o(2, 2) transformation involving the other

two. this discussion highlights the importance of the qdet(q+ + q) factor which is

essential in eliminating the terms in (16) - particularly the identity - that should not
appear in the at-space t-duality limit.

since neither qdet(q+ + q) nor aij depend on the metric, its inclusion does not
change the situation described above for the at space, except that now  also contains
the (det q)1/2 factor. for example, if we consider two t-dualities along x 1 and x 2 with
b12 = 0, then  = (detg)1/212, as can be directly veried using the result for a single
t-duality in [13]. this case is relevant to the application of so(d, d) transformations to
the simplest forms of dp-brane solutions for which the ns-ns two form vanishes.

in the more general case when b 6= 0, the singular limit det(q+ + q) = 0 includes,
in particular, the interesting case q+ = q, or s1r = (1d + 1
d b)1.
clearly, this can arise only in even d with constant b and the corresponding  will have
only one term which is proportional to i1id. thus we see that in this case, there exists
a special so(d, d) transformation, the spinor representation of which has the same form
as that for d t-dualities in at space. in general, even in non-at backgrounds, one can
parameterize a
b as r in (18) to show that a well dened spinor representation always
exists in the singular limits. having constructed the spinor representation of the induced
twist, we set out to nd the so(d, d) action on the massless ns-r and r-r elds that
involve .

4 so(d, d) transformation of space-time spinors

let us consider the gravitinos m , the dilatinos  and the space-time supersymmetry
transformation parameters  in type-ii string theories. the subscripts  denote the
worldsheet sector (+ for left-moving and  for right-moving) in which the spinor
index of the space-time spinor, or equivalently its ramond component, originates. we
assign positive chirality to  in both iia and iib theories which determines the chiralities
of all other spinors. all spinors are assumed to be independent of d coordinates x i but
may depend on the remaining 10  d coordinates x . the action of the non-trivial
elements of the o(d, d) group on these spinors can be obtained by demanding consistency
with supersymmetry transformations. these transformations were constructed in [19]
for type-iia theory and in [20] for type-iib theory. here, we write the supersymmetry
transformations in the string metric and in conventions more natural to string theory as
given in [13]. denoting the supersymmetry variations corresponding to + and  by +
and  respectively, it turns out that  and  depend only the ns-ns elds, on
which the o(d, d) action is well known, and are independent of r-r elds. therefore,
we can use these variations to determine the o(d, d) action on the spinors (though the
results are valid for o(d, d), the explicit construction of the spinor representation given in
section 2 is only for its so(d, d) subgroup). in the next section, we will use these results,
along with the construction in section 2, to determine the so(d, d) action on r-r elds
by considering the supersymmetry variation +. the derivation below closely follows
the one in section 3 of [13] and generalizes it from the single t-duality case to the o(d, d)
group actions.

here, we have used the fact that, due to (10), fw(+)m is related to fw()m by a local lorentz
transformation  , fw(+)m = 1fw()m  + 1m  which has a spinor representation 
dened by (12). the above equation will lead to the correct form for the variation +e+m
in the transformed theory provided we identifye+ =  + and +e+n =  ++m (q1

again up to 3-spinor terms. thus under an o(d, d) action, the supersymmetry transfor-
mation parameters transform to

while the transformation of the gravitinos can be read o from the o(d, d) action on the
supersymmetry variations m as,

e =  ,

e+ =  + ,

em = n (q1
e+m =  +n (q1

(23)

(24)

note that though the transformations we obtained for m receive corrections cubic in
the spinors, our nal results for m do not receive such corrections and are, in this sense,
exact. this can be understood on general grounds by noting that a 3-spinor correction to
(24) will induce 4- and higher spinor terms with derivative interactions in the supergravity
lagrangian, which should not exist. this was shown in more detail in [13] for the case of
a single t-duality. the same argument applies to the general case here simply because,
in principle, any non-trivial o(d, d) transformation can be constructed by intertwining
t-dualities with gl(d) transformations. thus the o(d, d) transformations have the basic
property that they do not mix quantities with dierent (space-time) fermion numbers.

though the results we have so far are enough to derive the so(d, d) action on the
ramond-ramond elds, for the sake of completeness, we also obtain the action on the
dilatinos. the dilatino supersymmetry variations  are given by

 =

2(cid:18)m m

m n khm n k(cid:19)  +    ,

(25)

where again    denotes 3-spinor terms. to relate these variations to the corresponding
ones in the o(d, d) transformed theory, we need the transformation of hm n k. it is most

11

useful to write this in the following two equivalent forms (see appendix a),

(26)

using these and comparing  with e in the transformed theory, we get the o(d, d)

action on the dilatinos as

 (s  r)1iij

e =   1
e+ = (cid:18)+ + 1

(27)

note that so far we have not restricted ourselves to supersymmetric backgrounds for which
the spinors and their supersymmetry variations vanish. in such cases, the transformations
above lead to the so(d, d) action on the fermionic zero-modes on the background.

5 so(d, d) transformation of r-r fields

having determined the so(d, d) action on  and m , we are now in a position to write
down its action on the ramond-ramond eld strengths and potentials, again by demanding
consistency of the transformations with supersymmetry. this will automatically insure
the so(d, d) covariance of the supergravity equations of motion as they are determined
by supersymmetry. we will then compare our results with the results obtained in the
framework of ncsym approach to matrix theory compactications for the so(3, 3) action
in type-iia on t 3. we will end the section by writing down an so(d, d) covariant from
for the ramond-ramond kinetic terms in the low-energy eective action.

it is most convenient to start with the supersymmetry variation +m which involves
the ramond-ramond eld strengths. in both iia and iib theories this can be written as
[19, 20] (see [13] for the required change of variables),

+m =

1

2(8)

e f m  +    .

(28)

here,    denote 3-spinor terms and f is a bispinor that contains the ramond-ramond
eld strengths and has the expansion,

f =xn

(1)n
n!

fm1mnm1mn .

(29)

in iia theory the summation contains only terms with even n (n = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), while
in iib theory it contains only terms with odd n (n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9). note that, for the time

12

being, we allow n = 0 and n = 10 in type iia theory, so that our formalism includes the
massive type-iia theory in [19]. the fact that  has denite chirality (in our case +1 in
both iia and iib) implies that f satises the constraint f = f 11, which in terms of
the components elds, translates to 1/(10  n)! f(10n) (10n) = 1/n! f(n) (n). however,
in the following it is more convenient to retain both f(n) and f(10n) in the summation.
furthermore, we assume that fm1mn are independent of the coordinates x i, which is
in fact required by the x i-independence of  and +m in (28). however, for the time
being, we do not demand the ramond-ramond potentials cm1mn to be x i independent
as this would exclude the massive iia theory (we will briey discuss this issue later).

let us now consider the supersymmetry variation e+m in the theory obtained after an

o(d, d) transformation,

e+m =

ee ef e()me +    .

(30)

(31)

(32)

ef has the same form as f above, with f(n) and (n) replaced by ef(n) ande(n)
since en

(), respectively.

m m , this becomes
(1)n
n!

ef =xn

efn1nn qn1

m1    qnn

mn m1mn .

now, using (23) and (24) along with (8) in (30) and comparing the result with (28), we
get a compact expression for the o(d, d) action on the ramond-ramond bispinor eld as

ef =q det q f .

this expression is valid for o(d, d) and could interchange iia and iib theories for elements
with determinant 1. however, to obtain the transformation of the components of f , we
restrict ourselves to the so(d, d) case and use the explicit expression for  as given by
(15). the above equation then reduces to

2qdet(q + q+)  (

ef = 2 d

1
2aijij) f .

(33)

the expression for the component elds are obtained by fusing together the antisym-
metrized products of -matrices in the expansions of  (16) and f (29), using a useful
-matrix identity in [21, 22] (that we quote in appendix b) and then matching the result
with the expansion of ef in (31). we will rst consider a simple case and then write down

the general result.

the d = 2, 3 cases : before writing down the general result, it is instructive to look at the
simplest case of [d/2] = 1 (corresponding to so(2, 2) and so(3, 3) transformations). in
this case, one can easily work out the transformation of ramond-ramond eld strengths,
using the -matrix identity in appendix b, to obtain

this expression is valid in both iia and iib theories, depending on whether n is even
or odd, and includes the massive iia theory if the eld strengths f (0) or f (10) are non-
vanishing. also, by construction, it does not mix odd-form and even-form eld strengths.
however, it does transform the eld strengths non-trivially. in particular, if the original
theory has only a non-vanishing q-form eld strength f (q), corresponding to d(q  2)-
branes, the theory obtained after the transformation will generically have non-zero q, (q
2) and (q + 2)-from eld strengths, while preserving the same amount of supersymmetry
as the original solution. this can be interpreted as a bound state of dq, d(q  2) and
d(q  4)-branes.

as a simple explicit example, let us consider the case of non-trivial so(2, 2) transfor-

mations in at-space. setting s = 1, this corresponds to

with q = 1 and qdet(q + q+) = 2 cos(/2). taking care of the antisymmetrization

in particular, for  =  one reproduces the correct result for two t-dualities along x 1 and
x 2, as can be veried directly by using the t-duality transformation of f (n) as given, for
example, in [13]. furthermore, the rst equation above implies that if f (0) is non-zero,
12 . therefore, in the case of massive iia theory, one cannot
restrict the potentials to be x i independent. this is discussed in more detail in [23] for
a single t-duality and in [24] for two t-dualities.

the general so(d, d) case : following the same steps as described above, one can eas-
ily work out the transformation of ramond-ramond eld strengths under the action of
non-trivial elements of the so(d, d) group, for generic d. after some straightforward
manipulations, one obtains

where, ncr are the binomial expansion coecients and aij and det(q + q+) are given
by (14) and (17), respectively. to evaluate q1
 , one can use either (5) or (6), according

14

to convenience. besides the non-trivial elements that we have considered so far, the full
so(d, d) group also includes gl(d) transformations involving x i and constant shifts in
bij. f (n) simply transform as n-forms under the rst set and are invariant under the
second set. this completes the construction of the full so(d, d) action on the ramond-
ramond eld strengths.

thought the transformation formula for f (n) looks rather bulky, in practice, at least
some components of it are somewhat simplied when restricted to specic solutions. this
is especially the case when the potentials c (n) can be chosen to be x i independent, so
that fi1in = 0.

transformation of ramond-ramond potentials: so far, we have only demanded the x i-
independence of the r-r eld strengths and not that of the potentials since this would
exclude the massive type-iia theory from the game. this is pointed out above for the
so(2, 2) case in at space and was considered in more detail in [23, 24]. let us now restrict
ourselves to the standard type-iia and iib theories by setting the iia mass parameter
f (0) to zero. the x i-independence of the ramond-ramond potentials is now compatible
with so(d, d) transformations.

it is convenient to dene the potentials c (n) such that

f (n)
m1mn = n[m1c (n1)

m2mn] 

n!

3!(n  3)!

h[m1m2m3c (n3)

m4mn] .

(36)

in this convention, the potentials are invariant under the ns-ns 2-form gauge transfor-
mations, but c (4) is not invariant under the sl(2, r) group of type-iib theory. to obtain
the so(d, d) action on the ramond-ramond potentials, the straightforward (although
tedious) procedure would be to substitute (36) in (35), and use the transformation of h
as given by (26), to work out the transformation of c (n) iteratively in n. the calculation
may get somewhat simplied if one chooses to work in the local lorentz frame, since then
one will not have to bother about the factors of q1
 in (35). however, here we will obtain
this transformation by a very simple argument:

first, note that any non-trivial so(d, d) transformation can, in principle, be con-
structed as a combination of appropriately chosen discrete t-duality transformations and
simple coordinate rotations, obtained by setting s = r = a. since this statement is
crucial for our argument, we will spell it out in some detail: any o(d) rotation, say r,
can be decomposed as a product of reections about planes perpendicular to properly
chosen axes, or equivalently, as a product of reections ti about planes perpendicular
to the coordinate axes xi, and properly chosen rotations ak; r = tinakn    ti1ak1. if
we choose s = akn    ak1, then the o(d, d) transformation implemented by r and s
corresponds to a sequence of t-duality transformations ti intertwined with coordinate
rotations ak, which proves the statement above. therefore, knowing how f (n) transforms
under a single t-duality, one can in principle construct its transformation under any

15

non-trivial so(d, d) element by using this decomposition and reproduce equation (35).
however, as emphasized in [13], f (n) and c (n) transform in exactly the same way under a
single t-duality (this is true up to a sign which is immaterial since we need even number
of t-dualities). being n-forms, they also transform in the same way under coordinate
transformations. this implies that if we construct the action of an so(d, d) element on
c (n), using its decomposition in terms of t-dualities and rotations, then we will end up
with the same expression as for f (n). hence,

ecm1mn = 2 d

[m1    (q1

as for the eld strengths, c (n) are invariant under constant shifts of bij and transform
as n-forms under gl(d). this completes the construction of the so(d, d) action on
ramond-ramond potentials.

we will not discuss the so(d, d) action on the r-r potentials in the massive iia
theory, in which case some of the c (n) will necessarily have an x i dependence and the
above transformations will get modied. however, we comment that, as shown in [13] for

in terms of c (n) and the mass parameter, such that the so(d, d) action on the potentials
has exactly the same form as in (37), but now with the c (n) replaced by the new variables

the single t-duality case, it should be possible to dene new x i independent variables bc (n)
bc (n).

comparison with results from ncsym : in some cases, the transformation of the r-r
potentials has also been studied in the framework of m-theory compactications to super
yang-mills theories on non-commutative tori [10, 12], where the string theory so(d, d)
transformations are implemented as a morita equivalence. from the 10-dimensional string
theory point of view, the transformation obtained in this approach is valid only in the
gij  0 limit and therefore, is not expected to coincide with the ones given above. to
make a comparison with these results, we restrict ourselves to the theory considered in
[10], which studies the 1-form and 3-form potentials in type iia theory compactied on
a 3-torus. the r-r potentials are assumed to have non-zero components only along the
torus directions. in our approach, the so(3, 3) transformation of these potentials can be
read o from (37) (or more directly from (34) after replacing f (n) by c (n)) as,

these coincide with the transformations obtained in the ncsym approach [10, 12] (also
see [25]). we can easily generalize the results obtained so far in the ncsym approach by
taking the gij  0 limit in (37).
so(d, d) covariant form of the kinetic energy terms : our analysis so far has been
based on showing the so(d, d) covariance of the supersymmetry transformations in type-ii
theories. since the equations of motion in these theories are determined by supersym-
metry, this approach also guarantees their so(d, d) covariance, and hence that of the
corresponding low-energy eective actions. the so(d, d) covariant form of the eective
action for the ns-ns elds has been known for a long time [3, 4, 5, 6]. here, we write
down an so(d, d) covariant form for the kinetic energy terms of the ramond-ramond
elds in the type-ii low-energy eective actions (ignoring the subtlety associated with the
self-dual 5-form in type-iib theory).

terms in both iia and iib theory can be written as

in terms of the ramond-ramond bispinor f given by (29), the r-r kinetic energy

which can be checked using the trace formula for the -matrices given in appendix b. the
index on 0 is a local lorentz frame index. in type-iia theory 11 f 11 = f while in iib
11 f 11 = f , which restricts the summation on the right hand side of the equation to
even n or odd n, respectively. the equation includes f (n) and f (10n) separately and the
duality between the two, including the self-duality of the 5-form, should be imposed by
hand. the 11 factors in the expression on the right hand side have been inserted so that
the kinetic energy terms for odd-forms and even-forms have the same sign, as should be
the case in our metric convention which is {, +,   , +}. now, using (31) and (4), one
can easily check that the r-r kinetic energy terms, as given by the left hand side of (38),
are manifestly so(d, d) covariant since,

1 = 0 t 0 ,

 11 = 11  .

17

the ramond-ramond elds also enter the action through chern-simon terms that we do
not consider here, though it should be possible to write these too in a manifestly so(d, d)
covariant form using the bispinor f and a similar quantity constructed in terms of the
r-r potentials.

the so(d, d) covariant form of the r-r kinetic terms given above is, as such, not
restrictive enough to determine the so(d, d) transformation of the r-r eld strengths if
we did not already know the transformation. however, the addition of the chern-simon
terms may change the situation. another option is to use the kinetic terms alone, but
express the eld strengths in terms of the potentials and the ns-ns 3-form eld strength
h. this form, along with the transformation of h given in (26) is restrictive enough to
determine transformation of the r-r potentials. in particular, note that the antisymmet-
ric part of the factor q1
 (s  r)1 appearing in (26) is related to aij appearing in the
transformation of c (n) in (37).

note that the above so(d, d) invariant form of the action is not invariant under o(d, d)
transformations with det o = 1 (including single t-dualities) that interchange iia and
iib theories. this is because in such cases,  11 = 11  and after the transformation
one obtains the kinetic energy terms with the wrong sign.

6 conclusions

we have obtained the so(d, d) transformations of the ramond-ramond eld strengths
and potentials and, in the process, have also determined the transformations of the space-
time supersymmetry parameters, the gravitinos and the dilatinos in type-ii theories. the
derivation is based on supersymmetry and is therefore guaranteed to be consistent with
the equations of motion provided the elds are independent of the d coordinates with
respect to which the transformation is performed. the transformations we obtain for the
r-r eld strengths also include the massive iia theory, though for the r-r potentials
we restrict ourselves to the usual massless iia case. besides the general cases, we also
discuss some special cases to highlight some features of the transformation and to check
the correctness of our results in these cases. since the transformations could also include
the time direction, we have been careful to keep track of the indices by explicitly retaining
the at metric . though we restrict ourselves to the so(d, d) case, all formulas which do
not involve the explicit form of the spinor representation , constructed in section 3, are
also valid for the o(d, d) case. in the so(3, 3) case we reproduce the results obtained in
the ncsym formalism of matrix theory compactications by taking the limit gij  0.
as mentioned in the introduction, there is also another approach to the problem we
have considered here which is based on constructing weyl spinor representations of the

18

so(d, d) group in terms of the ramond-ramond potentials and bm n [10, 11].
it is
interesting to complete this construction and reproduce the results obtained here in this
formalism. this will also clarify the connection between these two approaches.

the transformations obtained in this paper can be used to construct non-trivial d-
brane congurations, starting from simpler ones. an important feature of the transforma-
tion is that, applied to brane congurations for which the surviving supersymmetries are
independent of x i, it can produce more complicated brane congurations without reduc-
ing the amount of supersymmetry preserved, which is an indication of non-trivial bound
states of branes. though we have not considered such applications here, as an example,
we mention [26]. here, the authors construct a class of so(4, 4) transformations by ex-
plicitly intertwining t-dualities and spatial rotations to obtain a (d1,d5)-brane system
with a non-vanishing b-eld. this solution corresponds to a genuine bound state of d1
and d5-branes as opposed to the marginal bound state with zero b-eld.

b some -matrix results

we use the metric signature {1, +1, . . . , +1} and dene the -matrices such that,

in the majorana-weyl representation all a are real, with 0 antisymmetric and others
symmetric. to fuse products of -matrices into antisymmetrized ones, we use the identity
