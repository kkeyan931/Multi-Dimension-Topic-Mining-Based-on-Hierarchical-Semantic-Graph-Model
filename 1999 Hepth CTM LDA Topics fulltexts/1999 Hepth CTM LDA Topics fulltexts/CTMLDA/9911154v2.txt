abstract

the relevance of calibrations, and generalized calibrations, to super-
symmetric m-brane congurations, and their associated eld theories, is
reviewed, with emphasis on applications to domain walls and domain wall
junctions of d=4 n=1 supersymmetric eld theories.

minimal surfaces have long been an active area of mathematics. with the advent
of the brane revolution they have become important to theoretical particle physics
via m-theory. an important development on the mathematical side was the intro-
duction in 1982 of the concept of a calibration [1]. in the simplest cases this deals
with p-dimensional submanifolds of en. a p-form  on en is a calibration if, for all
tangent p-planes ,
(i)   vol
(ii) d = 0
the contact set of the calibration is the set of all tangent p-planes for which the
calibration inequality (i) is saturated, and a calibrated p-surface is one for which all
tangent p-planes belong to the contact set of a calibration2. a theorem of harvey and
lawson states that a calibrated p-surface has minimum p-volume among all p-surfaces
with the same homology [1]. that is, it is a minimal p-surface.

the proof of this theorem is elementary. consider an open set u of a surface
satisfying the premise. since the calibration inequality (i) is saturated, by hypothesis,
we have

vol(u) = zu



(1)

now consider any other p-surface that coincides with the original one on the boundary
u of u, and let u  be an open set of this new surface with u  = u. since we
only consider surfaces within the same homology class there exists a (p + 1)-surface
d such that d = u  u . it follows that
vol(u) = zu 

 + zd

d .

(2)

by property (i) the rst term on the right hand side cannot exceed vol(u ), while the
second term vanishes by property (ii). we therefore deduce the inequality

vol(u)  vol(u ) .

(3)

the theorem then follows from the fact that this is true for any choice of u.

applications of this theorem to branes, pioneered3 in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], rely on the
fact that, in many cases of interest, the energy of a static p-brane is proportional to
the p-volume of its worldspace w, the constant of proportionality being the p-volume
tension t . there are, however, many cases in which the energy is not simply the
p-volume. obvious examples are d-branes and the m5-brane which have gauge-elds
on their worldvolume. the theory of calibrations is still applicable in these cases
if (when consistency allows it) one restricts attention to congurations for which

2each p-plane tangent to a surface in en corresponds to a point on the grassmannian of p-planes
through the origin of en, so the contact set of a calibration is a subset of this grassmannian. this
relies on the fact that en has trivial holonomy, but a modied theory exists for spaces of reduced
holonomy.

3no attempt will be made here to survey the many subsequent applications, except those of

direct relevance to d=4 n=1 domain walls and their intersections to be discussed below.

worldvolume gauge elds vanish. discounting worldvolume gauge elds, the bosonic
p-brane action takes the universal form

s = t zw

[vol(g) + a]

(4)

where vol(g) is the (p+1)-volume form in the metric g induced on the worldvolume w
swept out by the worldspace w in the course of its time evolution, and a is a (p+1)-
form induced on w from a background (p+1)-form. for stationary backgrounds one
has a timelike killing vector eld k for which lkf vanishes, where f = da is the
(p+2)-form eld strength for a. this kiling vector eld generates a symmetry of the
p-brane action for which there is a corresponding noether energy. for static branes4
in static backgrounds the energy density is

h = t h

k2det m + i

(5)

where m is the induced worldspace metric, and  is the worldspace dual of ika (in
a gauge for which lka = 0). in other words,  is an electrostatic energy density
associated with the background gauge potential a.
if  vanishes then a minimal
energy p-brane is a minimal p-surface (in an appropriately rescaled metric unless
k2  1). if  does not vanish then a brane of minimal energy is not a minimal
surface. however, in this case one can invoke a theory of generalized calibrations
[8, 9] (not to be confused with generalizations involving non-vanishing worldvolume
gauge elds [10, 11]).

a generalized calibration is a p-form satisfying, for all tangent p-planes ,

(i)   k2 vol
(ii) d = ikf
for simplicity we shall assume here that k2  1, and refer to [9] for the general
case. in this case, property (i) reduces to property (i) and the same arguments as
before lead to

vol(u)  vol(u ) + zd

d .

(6)

in the gauge for which lka = 0 we have ikf = d(ika) and hence, from property
(ii), d = d(ika). thus,

zd

d = zu

ika + zu 

ika ,

and we deduce the generalized bound

vol(u) + zu

ika  vol(u ) + zu 

ika .

this is equivalent to

where e is the integral of the energy density h of (5), with k2  1. this illustrates
the general result of [9] that the contact set of a generalized calibration is a minimal
energy p-surface.

generalized calibrations are needed to study supersymmetric branes in those su-
pergravity backgrounds for which the electrostatic energy density  is non-vanishing.
in this contribution i will limit myself to supergravity backgrounds for which  van-
ishes, and for which the background metric is at, so that k2  1. in such cases
only the standard calibrations are needed. i will begin by explaining how, in these
simple circumstances, the calibration bound (i) follows from the p-brane supersym-
metry algebra; i refer the reader to [9] for the general case. a super p-brane in a
vacuum background is invariant under supertranslations of superspace. this invari-
ance implies the existence of spinorial noether charges q, in addition to the energy
and momentum. as this symmetry is a rigid one, the charges in any region u of the
brane are well-dened. when account is taken of the p-form central charge in the
spacetime supertranslation algebra [12], one nds that

{q, q} = zu hvol  0i1...ipdx i1  . . .  dx ipi

(10)

where vol is the volume p-form in the induced worldspace metric m, and x i are the
n-space coordinates. the sign depends on the orientation of the p-brane in en. the
values of p and n are restricted by supersymmetry, but these restrictions are those
required anyway for applications to m-theory. the values of p and n are further
restricted if we assume that the supercharges q are real. this assumption is not
essential but will be made here to simplify the presentation. the matrices (0, i)
are the dirac matrices of (1+n)-dimensional minkowski spacetime.

we now introduce a real, commuting, covariantly constant spinor , to be called

a killing spinor, normalized so that

t  = 1 .

(11)

the number of such spinors will always equal the number of supersymmetry charges
q. given such a spinor, (10) implies that

(q)2 = zu

[vol  ] ,

where

 =

1
p! (cid:16)t 0i1 ip(cid:17) dx i1      dx ip .

(12)

(13)

the left hand side of (12) is manifestly positive, and since this is so for any region u
we must have

for all . it is also obvious, since  is covariantly constant, that d = 0. we conclude
that  is a p-form calibration. as we shall now see, the calibration inequality (14) is

  vol

saturated by congurations that preserve some fraction of the spacetime supersym-
metry.

the calibration just found from considerations of supersymmetry is such that

(16)

evaluated at the point to which the p-plane  is tangent. given the restrictions on p
and n mentioned previously, it can be shown that

2 = 1 .

(17)

the eigenvalues of  are therefore 1, and the bound (14) is an immediate conse-
quence of this. as we have already derived this bound, the more relevant point here
is that the condition for its saturation is

 =  .

(18)

this is the key equation for what follows5. for many simple applications we may
choose coordinates for which the killing spinor  is constant. for simplicity, let us
suppose that such coordinates have been chosen and that  is constant. for a given
tangent p-plane , equation (18) becomes  = , which states that  must belong
to the +1 eigenspace of ; let us call this s +
 . this space has a dimension equal
to half the number of supersymmetry charges so, locally, the brane preserves 1/2
supersymmetry. this will also be true globally if the brane geometry is planar, but
in general  will depend on position on the brane and hence s +
 will vary with position.
in this case the space of solutions of (18) is the intersection of the spaces s +
for all

. for a generic p-brane this space is the empty set but for special cases there will be
a non-empty intersection. non-planar branes (or intersections of planar branes) for
which (18) has at least one solution are calibrated by , but will generally preserve
less than 1/2 supersymmetry. as we go from one point on the p-surface to another
we go from one p-plane  to another p-plane  . correspondingly,

    = r1r ,

(19)

where r is some so(n) rotation matrix in the spinor representation. the p-surface
will be a calibrated one only if there exist non-zero solutions  to r = , because
only in this case will s +

  have a non-empty intersection.

 and s +

in the context of m-theory,  is a 32 component majorana spinor of so(1, 10),
which is real in a real representation of the dirac matrices. for static solutions we

5the lagrangian version of this equation was originally derived in [13, 14] from considerations

of kappa-symmetry. the derivation here follows [9].

may consider  to be a spinor of so(10), so n  10. preservation of some non-
zero fraction  of supersymmetry by a static m-brane conguration requires r to
take values in a subgroup g of so(n)  so(10) such that the decomposition of the
spinor representations of so(n) contained in the spinor of so(10) includes at least
one singlet. if the total number of singlets is 32 then the conguration will preserve
the fraction  of supersymmetry; it is -supersymmetric. the subgroups of so(10)
with the required property are

su(5)  so(10)
spin(7)  so(8)
su(4)  so(8)
g2  so(7)
su(3)  so(6)
su(2)  so(4)

(20)

for each supersymmetric, and hence calibrated, p-surface the tangent planes must
parameterize a coset space g/h, where g is the rotation group discussed above and
h is some stability subgroup. the groups g and h, together with the dimension p
of the calibrated surface, provide a classication [4, 5, 6] of the calibrations relevant
to supersymmetric congurations of m5-branes6. these are shown in table 1.

the simplest realization of these possibilities is via orthogonally intersecting m5-
branes. here i will follow the approach of [5]. consider, for example, two m5-branes
intersecting according to the array

m5 : 1 2 3 | 4
m5 : 1 2 3 |   6

5     
7   

6there are additional cases when one includes m2-branes [4, 9]. see [15] for a comprehensive

review.

each m5-brane determines a tangent p-plane , and hence an associated matrix 
with +1 eigenspace s +
 . the intersection of these spaces can be shown, by standard
methods, to be 8-dimensional, so the conguration preserves 1/4 supersymmetry and
must be a calibrated conguration. the 1-2-3 directions, separated from the others
in the above array by the vertical line, are common to both m5-brane worldvolumes.
they play an inessential role and may be ignored, as may the transverse 8-9- di-
rections (following [16], we use  as a convenient single character for ten), so we
eectively have two intersecting 2-branes in e4. the 2-brane in the 6-7 transverse
directions may be considered as a solitonic deformation of a test brane in the 4-5
directions. from this perspective, the orthogonal intersection of the two 2-branes is
a singular limit of a conguration of a single 2-brane, which can be considered as
an elliptic curve in c2, asymptotic to the two orthogonal 2-planes in the 4-5 and 6-7
directions. either plane can be obtained from the other by a discrete su(2) rotation
in c2. such rotations preserve 1/4 supersymmetry [17]. we can desingularize the
intersection, while maintaining 1/4 supersymmetry by allowing a continuous su(2)
rotation from one asymptotic 2-plane to another. we then have a non-singular elliptic
curve which, because it preserves 1/4 supersymmetry, must be a calibrated 2-surface.
it must be calibrated by an su(2) kahler calibration as this is the only case with the
required properties, the kahler and special lagrangian calibrations being equivalent
for su(2).

this conclusion can be conrmed directly from the constraints imposed on killing
spinors by two orthogonally intersecting m5-branes [5]. let us consider here the
simpler case of two orthogonally intersecting m2-branes because the three common
directions of the two m5-branes are irrelevant to the nal result. we take the m2-
branes to intersect according to the array

the calibration form (13) in this case is the 2-form

 =

xi,j=1(cid:16)t 0ij(cid:17) dxi  dxj .

the constraints imposed on the killing spinors by the two m2-branes are

012 =  ,

034 =  .

these imply

and also

12 = 34 ,

13 = 24 ,

14 = 25 ,

t 013 = 0

t 014 = 0 .

given the normalization (11) of , we then nd that

 = dx 1  dx 2 + dx 3  dx 4 .

introducing the complex coordinates z = x 1 + ix 2 and w = x 1 + ix 2 we see that 
is a closed hermitian 2-form on e4; that is, a kahler 2-form. it is also su(2)-invariant
with (dz, dw) transforming as a complex doublet. the 2-form  is therefore an su(2)
kahler calibration.

the same conclusion can be reached for m5-branes via a similar analysis of the
constraints imposed on killing spinors (after factoring out from the 5-form of (13)
the volume 3-form of the three common directions). but these constraints apply to
a much wider class of congurations than orthogonally intersecting m5-branes. in
particular, they apply to any 1/4 supersymmetric conguration of a single m5-brane
that is asymptotic to the conguration of orthogonally intersecting m5-branes. the
asymptotic planes may also be rotated relative to each other (see [6] for a discus-
sion of calibrations in this context). one may consider the array as a shorthand
for the entire collection of such congurations. pushing this interpretation to the
extreme, one may regard the array as nothing more than a tabular representation
of the constraints (22), so that it may be considered to represent any conguration
yielding these constraints regardless of the asymptotic behaviour. if an interpretation
this liberal is adopted then the geometry of the array may suggest results that are
spurious in particular contexts, but one may still hope to capture general features
common to all cases. we shall return to this point below when discussing the asso-
ciative and cayley calibrations, but we rst need to consider a simpler case with 1/8
supersymmetry.

consider three m5-branes intersecting according to the array

m5 : 1 2 3 | 4
m5 : 1 2 3 |   6
m5 : 1 2 3 |     8

5     
7

each m5-brane determines a tangent p-plane , and hence an associated matrix 
with +1 eigenspace s +
 . the intersection of these spaces can be shown, by standard
methods, to be 4-dimensional, so the conguration preserves 1/8 supersymmetry and
must be a calibrated one. the 1-2-3 directions, separated from the others in the
above array by the vertical line, are common to all m5-brane worldvolumes. they
play an inessential role and may be ignored, as may the transverse tenth direction,
so we eectively have three intersecting 2-branes in e6. the 2-branes in the 6-7 and
8-9 transverse directions may be considered, as before, as solitonic deformations of
a test brane in the 4-5 directions.
in this case the orthogonal intersection of the
three 2-branes can be considered a singular limit of a conguration of a single 2-
brane wrapped on an elliptic curve in c3, and asymptotic to the three orthogonal
2-planes in the 4-5, 6-7, and 8-9 directions. each of these planes can be obtained
from any of the other two by a discrete su(3) rotation in c3. such rotations preserve
1/8 supersymmetry [17]. we can desingularize the intersection, while maintaining 1/8
supersymmetry by allowing a continuous su(3) rotation from one asymptotic 2-plane
to another. we then have a non-singular elliptic curve which, because it preserves
1/8 supersymmetry, must be a calibrated 2-surface.
it must be calibrated by an

7

su(3) kahler calibration as this is the only candidate with the required properties.
this can be veried as before from the constraints imposed on killing spinors by the
intersecting m5-brane conguration.

in any conguration of intersecting branes there will generally be zero modes
trapped on the intersection and these will govern its low energy dynamics. in the
above example the intersection is 3-dimensional so the zero modes trapped on the
intersection yield a (3+1)-dimensional quantum eld theory. since the conguration
preserves 1/8 of the supersymmetry of the m-theory vacuum, the intersection eld
theory has a total of four supersymmetries, transforming as a real spinor of so(1, 3).
in other words, the low energy intersection dynamics is governed by a d=4 n=1
sqft. if the intersection is desingularized so as to describe a single non-singular
m5-brane then this sqft will be determined by the m5-branes eective action. the
sqft obtained in this way from three orthogonally-intersecting m5-branes is not of
particular interest in itself, but any minimal energy m5-brane wrapping a riemann
surface in a at m-theory vacuum is also calibrated by an su(3) kahler calibration,
and various sqfts can be thus obtained. a particularly interesting example in which
an m5-brane wraps a riemann surface in the s 1-compactied m-theory vacuum was
identied in [18] as a theory, now called mqcd, with properties similar to that of
sqcd.

an example of an associative calibration is provided by four m5-branes intersect-

ing according to the array [5]

ignoring the common directions, and the transverse tenth direction, and interpreting
the last three rows as solitonic deformations of a test 3-brane in the 3-4-5 direc-
tions, we conclude that we have a calibrated 3-surface in e7. since this conguration
preserves 1/16 supersymmetry, it must be calibrated by a 3-form, and the associa-
tive 3-form calibration is the only candidate. we might wish to relate this to a d=3
sqft, but there is an alternative application. noting that this array can be obtained
from the previous one by the addition of a fourth m5-brane, we retabulate it as

m5 : 1
m5 : 1

if the rst three m5-branes are interpreted as supplying a d=4 n=1 sqft with coor-
dinates (x0, x1, x2, x3) then the array suggests that we interpret the fourth m5-brane
as a domain wall in this theory. the 1/16 supersymmetry of associative calibrations
of an m5-brane translates to 1/2 supersymmetry of the d=4 n=1 minkowski vac-
uum; in other words, the domain wall is a 1/2 supersymmetric bps wall. this is a

8

simple analogue of wittens identication of associative calibrations of the m5-brane
of mqcd as 1/2 supersymmetric domain walls [18] (see also [19, 20]). it has been
known for some time [21, 22] that the wz model admits 1/2 supersymmetric domain
walls for an appropriate superpotential (the solutions having been studied originally
as solitons of the dimensionally-reduced n=2 d=2 sqft [23]). they also appear in
su(n) sqcd with n  2 [24] because the low eective action includes a wz action
with a superpotential admitting n isolated critical points and hence n degenerate
vacua [25]. minimal energy congurations that interpolate from one vacuum to an-
other are 1/2 supersymmetric domain walls. it should therefore be no surprise that
mqcd admits similar domain walls, although their geometrical nature (and the fact
that they are d-branes [18]) is remarkable.

it has recently been appreciated that the domain walls of wz models, and hence
of sqcd, may intersect at junctions, the conguration as a whole preserving 1/4
supersymmetry [26, 27]. the junction of two domain walls is 1-dimensional. let z be
a complex coordinate for the plane orthogonal to this direction. the 1/4 supersym-
metric domain wall junctions of the wz model are congurations (z) of a complex
scalar eld satisfying

d
dz

= w () ,

(26)

where the superpotential w is a holomorphic function of . the 1/2 supersymmet-
ric domain walls themselves are special solutions of this equation with translational
symmetry along one direction in the z-plane, but the generic solution is 1/4 super-
symmetric. in the case that

w  = 1  3 ,

(27)

corresponding to a quartic superpotential, there are three vacua with  = (1, , 2)
where  is a cube-root of unity. in this case we expect a z3-symmetric junction, as
shown in fig. 1. although no exact solution to (26) of this type is known, numerical
studies suggest that one exists [28] and the existence of a z3-invariant minimum energy
domain wall junction solution to the second order wz equations with superpotential
(27) has been proved [29]. in addition, an exact solution representing a domain-wall
junction has recently been found in a more complicated, but related, model [30]. it
seems clear from these results that 1/4 supersymmetric domain wall junctions are
generic to d=4 n=1 sqfts. in particular they are expected in su(n) sqft for
n  3 [31].
this raises an obvious question. does mqcd have 1/4 supersymmetric domain
wall junctions and, if so, what is their geometrical realization? a suggestion of
gauntlett, which will be explored in a forthcoming article [32], is that domain wall
junctions of mqcd are cayley calibrations of the mqcd m5-brane. this can be
motivated by considering the realization of cayley calibrations as ve m5-branes

this conguration preserves 1/32 supersymmetry, corresponding to 1/4 supersym-
metry of the d=4 n=1 vacuum dened by the rst three m5-branes. if the last two
m5-branes are viewed as excitations about this vacuum then it is apparent from the
array that they can be interpreted as intersecting domain walls.
