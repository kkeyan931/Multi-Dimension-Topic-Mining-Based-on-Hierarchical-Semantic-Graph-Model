   a relativistic quantized particle model avoids difficulties through (1) a hamiltonian
undecomposable  into  h=h0+hi , (2) a separation of the evolution parameter s from dynamics, (3)
leptons  and  hadrons  composed  of  quarks,  and  (4)  the  absence  of  background  reference
frames.  the stringlike lagrangian is l=-[-f2(q)(dq/ds)2+(fdq/ds)2]1/2.  q(s) defines quark
positions; the form of  f(q)  determines  the  interaction.    the  strong  lagrangian  is  symmetric
under  quark  exchange.    transformation  to  new  quark  coordinates  hides  the  symmetry.    a
variational principle for the parametrically invariant action in terms of these coordinates supplies
natural  boundary  conditions  (n.b.c.).    the  resulting  symmetry  breaking  yields  lepton  and
hadron  quarks  that  behave  differently.    however,  both  become  strings  asymptotically.    the
n.b.c.  produce  composite  mass-shell  constraints  and  suppress  time-oscillations.    strong  scattering
between composites is calculated.  the leptons behave as free particles.  a second choice of f(q)
produces  unified  electroweak  interactions.    first-order  perturbation  theory  is  applied  to  lepton-
lepton  scattering.    unperturbed  states  are  asymptotic  solutions  from  separate  strong  interaction
clusters.  transforms between position and momentum representations, determined by the n.b.c.,
eliminate advanced potentials. scattering amplitudes obey feynman rules.

i.  introduction

   in this paper, a model, not a theory, is presented.  it has a particle ontology yet shares
characteristics with both quantum field theory and string theory.  although it derives from the
research of recent decades, it necessarily demands a simultaneous re-examination of several basic
ideas underlying current particle physics:  (1) the use of physically extended objects as
fundamental entities (namely, fields and strings),  (2) the role of free particles in formulating
fundamental theories, (3) the nature of the fundamental constituents of leptons and hadrons, (4) the
choice of evolution parameter, and (5) the use of background frames of reference.  in regard to (1),
quantum field theory is currently being questioned as a fundamental theory,1,2,3,4,5 and some

physicists are skeptical whether strings can be considered as fundamental.3,6   concerning (2), it
has been argued by s. weinberg that, with some caveats, quantum mechanics plus lorentz
invariance plus cluster decomposition implies quantum field theory.7   one of those caveats is that

2

the hamiltonian has a meaningful decomposition h=h0+hi.  for the basic particle quark model
of this paper, there is no such decomposition.  the departure from (3) is connected to the concept
of supersymmetry, for we assume that leptons as well as hadrons are composed of quarks, and we
begin with a lagrangian symmetric under the interchange of lepton and hadron quarks (when
spin is introduced into this simple model, lepton and hadron composites take on half-integer
and integer spin, respectively).   let us immediately reassure the reader that the model leads to
composite leptons that behave like free point particles under the strong interactions.
   the departure from idea (4) also involves a deep conceptual shift.  in relativity, time is on an
equal footing with space, but in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, time t is treated as a c-number
and separated from the dynamical variables.  on the other hand, canonical methods of quantization
are based on nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.  this discrepancy, known  from the inception of
quantum mechanics, was reviewed by k. kuchar8 in regard to attempts to apply canonical
methods, including diracs constraint method, in quantizing relativistic theories.  one of kuchars
suggestions:  put the dynamical variables and time on an equal footing.   in the present model, this
is accomplished by expressing all four-vector variables in terms of an (unmeasurable) evolution
parameter s.  thus, the kinematics (evolution) is separated from the dynamics.  in doing this, we
must recognize that poincare invariance now implies conservation laws in the variable s, and
examine the conditions under which the usual space-time conservation laws hold in an observers
time.  it is found that these conditions are closely linked to the particle-antiparticle concept.
   in regard to (5), the basic model is formulated in the absence of a background frame of reference
and thus may have implications for formulations of cosmological quantum theory.  a. ashtekar
and j. lewandowski9 and c. rovelli10 are among those who emphasize the necessity of doing
quantum physics in the absence of a space-time geometry.  the elimination of background
reference frames was also considered in the past by j. b. barbour and l. smolin.11
    in spite of the differences with mainstream ideas discussed above, the basic assumptions
underlying the model of this paper bear a resemblance to much that is current in particle physics. 
to begin with, the construction of the lagrangian parallels gauge theory in the following way.  it
is assumed that the fundamental lagrangian must exhibit a spontaneously broken internal
symmetry (in this case, in this simplified model, it is a symmetry between two systems of quarks).
in other words, without the addition of any other conditions by hand, the symmetry must be
such that the solutions, as a class, do not exhibit that symmetry of the lagrangian.12  the analogy
to gauge theory continues:  under a transformation of coordinates, the symmetry becomes
hidden while, at the same time, composite-particle mass shell constraints p2=m2 are revealed. 
   a second similarity to current physics comes from the string-like form of the lagrangian.  it is

3

assumed that a general lagrangian holds for all  interactions and has the form

l =  7   f  q ( s )  2  q

a 
a 2 ( s ) +   q
( s ) a f  q ( s )  2 ? 1 / 2 .                          (1.1)
q(s) is a vector whose components are the position vectors of the spinless quarks of the system; 
f(q) is a vector function; and s is the evolution parameter.  the lagrangian (1.1) is lorentz
covariant and leads to a parametrically invariant action.  presumably, a good choice of f(q) would
lead to a true unification model.  lacking this, we assume different functions for f(q) for two
kinds of interactions, the strong and the electroweak.  however, within the model the
electrodynamic and weak interactions are truly unified.  moreover, we require that the
solutions match at the boundaries of the strong and electroweak domains.
   a third link with current physics is the assumption of a form of supersymmetry.  although the
quarks are assumed to be spinless, the assumed fundamental lagrangian is symmetric under the
interchange of two varieties of quarks.  this symmetry is spontaneously broken, however, so that
composite particles, which are observable (i.e., obey mass-shell constraints), are composed of
pairs of either lepton or hadron quarks, rather than mixtures thereof.  the behaviors of the
resulting leptons and hadronsare very different under these strong interactions, with the
leptons behaving, in essence, as free particles.  in spite of this difference in behavior, the
lepton and hadrons share the same mass spectrum.  in sec. vii, a brief consideration of spin
variables suggests that the leptons have half-integer spin while the hadrons have integer spin.  
   the model itself is simple and the input very limited, but as the remarks above suggest, its basis
is new and the resulting implications are broad in nature.  therefore, before presenting the details
of the model, let us have a little closer look at the concepts involved.

a.  why  have  fields  and/or  strings  been  considered  necessary?

     in recent years, concern has been expressed about the usefulness of quantum field theory in
advancing our knowledge of fundamental processes.1,2,3,4,5   there are many unanswered
questions about problems such as quantum gravity, the true unification of forces, the calculation of
testable predictions, and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.  although, for many,
superstring theory holds much promise of providing a new physics,4,5,13 there are those who

question whether it will provide answers to such questions.3,6   one purpose of this paper is to

suggest that, in the light of new insights in particle physics, it may be worthwhile to re-examine old
concepts.  there were, for example, in the growingly distant past, attempts to construct relativistic
quantum particle theories,14 but this area of study largely disappeared before the discoveries of the
recent decades.

4

   the use of fields in formulating the description of dynamical systems has gone far beyond the
classical field theories of maxwell and einstein.15   in particular, quantum fields have become the
basic ingredients in the formulation of relativistic particle physics.  the concept of a field arose in
physics partly to offer an intuitive explanation of how forces act over distance.  this allowed the
elimination of the conceptually difficult idea of forces transmitted through a vacuum.  although the
idea of a void was considered by the ancient greeks, it continues to puzzle us:  does nature exhibit
bodies separated by voids or bodies immersed in some kind of ether?  since this question has
not been settled, one has to ask why field theory has become so ubiquitous.  why not a relativistic
particle mechanics?  although a good deal of attention has recently been given to the conceptual
foundations of field theory, very little consideration has been given to former relativistic particle
ontologies.   apparently, relativistic particle ontologies are not thought to be viable.  s. weinberg,
for example, demonstrates that, with certain caveats, the only way to reconcile quantum mechanics
with special relativity and cluster decomposition is through quantum field theory.5,7
   field theory did not immediately permeate all of particle physics.  difficulties, such as infinite
self-energies, kept alive attempts to formulate relativistic particle dynamics throughout the middle
decades of the 20th century.13   the best known attempt is wheeler and feynmans action-at-a-
distance model of electrodynamics.16,17  however, all efforts failed in one way or another.  these
failures (for example, particles exceeding the velocity of light, lack of quantization, lack of cluster
decomposition, and the inability to create and annihilate particles) contributed to the further
expansion of field theory.  the difficulties of infinities in field theory can be overcome, for
example, by renormalization, even if the means are complicated.
   the field theory approach in particle physics culminated with the formulation of the standard
model.  as extremely successful as it has been, it is not believed to be the final answer for several
reasons.18  one compelling reason is that the standard model does not represent a true unification
of physical laws.  a true unification implies that all the forces of nature are but different aspects
of a single law.
   it is the possibility of a true unification, one that includes gravity, in a unique theory that
underlies the attraction of superstring theory.13,19,20  superstring theory is, at present, the only
candidate for such a unification.  it is also attractive because it is a theory with no free parameters. 
however, superstring theory suffers from the lack of physical predictions that can be tested
experimentally.  moreover, the necessity of introducing extra unseen spatial dimensions on the
basis of mathematical consistency alone has prompted criticism that the theory is unrealistic.3,6

5

b.    a  source  of  complexity  for  field  and  string  theories:

physically  extended  objects  

     the continuous field or string can be thought of as an infinite number of beads along an
imaginary string.  this produces difficulties because separate modes of oscillation must be
considered for each bead.  it is the physical extensions of fields and strings that forbid their
descriptions the simple elegance of nonrelativistic classical and quantum mechanics.  field theories
are marred by the difficulties of mathematical divergences.  superstring theory is further
complicated because the strings themselves are also physically extended objects.  the algebra of
the constraint functions cannot be closed without the introduction of extra spatial dimensions.
   dirac was concerned with preserving the successes of (nonrelativistic) classical mechanics during
the development of quantum mechanics.  he wrote,21  the underlying ideas and laws [of classical
mechanics] . . .  form a simple and elegant scheme, which one would be inclined to think could not
be seriously modified without having all its attractive features spoilt.  due in part to diracs own
work, the exposition of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics retains a good deal of the beauty of
nonrelativistic classical physics.
   the formulations of relativistic particle field theories and superstring theories represent two very
successful and interesting developments in physics during the twentieth century.  through them,
elegant new mathematical tools have been developed that may be useful in the future, and many
insights have been gained about diverse problems such as spontaneous symmetry breaking, the
inclusion of gravity within a quantum theory, the origins of the universe, and the behavior of
black holes.  nevertheless, one cannot say these formulations have the simplicity and elegance of
either classical physics or nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.

c.  the  roles  of  free  particles  and  free  fields

    there is another entrenched idea (besides fields), basic to most of physics, which probably has
its roots in the ancient greek pre-occupation with individuality and freedom.  in physics, from
classical particle dynamics to quantum field theories, the equations for a free particle or field
generally form the starting point, after which interactions are introduced.  this is often
characterized by writing the lagrangian as a sum of the free and interaction parts, or l = t+v. 
the assumption in a different form, h = h o 
quantum mechanics cannot be reconciled with special relativity.5,7  
 

+ h i, is the basis for an argument by s. weinberg that

   in light of the difficulties of field and string theories, it is worthwhile to reconsider whether it is
necessary to introduce physically extended objects as the basic components of any theory.  the
research of the last few decades gives us a fresh vantage point in the consideration of relativistic
particle dynamics and the problems that were previously encountered.  it is further intriguing, as
we shall see, to consider the possibility of solving the earlier problems of particle dynamics by
eliminating free particles as the basis of the theory.
   nevertheless, like dirac, we would hate to lose the attractive features of current theories in
choosing a new approach.  among the most intriguing aspects of field theory are the harmonic
oscillator operators a(k) and a(k) which arise in the fourier transform of the free field associated

with a particular particle.  weinberg22 has pointed out that quite apart from being annihilation and
creation operators, these operators make possible cluster decomposition, i.e., the uncorrelated
results of distant experiments.
     the harmonic oscillator has played a role in various nonrelativistic quark models of hadrons,
and was extended to include relativistic calculations by feynman, kislinger, and ravndal.23
however, the problem of time-oscillations prevented the nonrelativistic quark model from being
rigorously extended to the relativistic domain.  thus, in considering a relativistic particle 
dynamics, we must first construct a model that can be considered realistic.
  we shall see that the relativistic harmonic-oscillator hamiltonian for the strong interaction
+ h i in any meaningful way.  the basic
version of this model cannot be broken up into h = h 0 
assumptions underlying the model are (1) all  observable particles consist of constituents we shall
call quarks, and (2) spontaneous symmetry breaking results in two varieties of quarks  which
will be termed lepton and hadron quarks.  concomitantly, the symmetry breaking also results
in two kinds of observable composite particles, lepton and hadrons.  the possibility of
bypassing the problem of unphysical behavior is quite clear. unphysical quarks can be
allowed provided they cannot be observed directly and the observable particles they make up
behave physically.  note that this was anticipated by the quark-exchange duality diagrams of
dual models of the 70s in which quarks can be interpreted as turning around in time.24   the
quarks can considered as unobservable if, by assuming quark confinement in the initial, quarks are
also confined in the final state.  the unobservable quarks brings into question whether the
ontology of the model is to be based on particles or structural relationships.1,2  however, here we
shall not discuss this deep philosophical question.  if the quarks are not real particles in the usual
sense, they are nonetheless a mechanism for obtaining real results.25

7

  the assumption that all observable composites consist of quarks is basic to the model in all
energies ranges, not just the strong-interaction domain.  leptons, of course, have not heretofore
been considered to be composed of quarks. it may be worthwhile to point out an incongruity of the
standard model.  the assumed fundamental particles, namely quarks and leptons, have very
different properties.  why should nature group them together?  the results of this paper suggest
that this may have been the stumbling block to true unification.
 

e.  the  outline  of  the  paper

   a naive heuristic model is presented which suggests the following possibilities:  (1) constituent
quarks allow a self-consistent formulation of quantum relativistic particle dynamics in which
subsidiary conditions are built in as part of the dynamical system (natural boundary conditions); 
(2) quarks are the fundamental constituents of both hadrons and leptons;  (3) these quarks yield a
true unification of the electrodynamic and weak interactions;  and (4) they lead to the derivation of
feynman rules for composite scattering in electroweak perturbation theory. 
   the model is kept simple in order to readily exhibit the essential features of the new concepts. 
discussion is limited to composite particles whose constituents are pairs of spinless quarks.26 
thus, the composite particles of the model cannot directly represent experimentally observed
leptons and hadrons.  nevertheless, we shall take the liberty of choosing the same nomenclature,
that is, just as we have chosen to call the constituent particles quarks, we shall also use the labels
leptons and hadrons to describe the composite particles of the model.  from now on, however,
we shall omit the quotation marks.  we shall also use the terms strong and electroweak
interactions in the same manner.  these loosely defined terms allow the model to be more
intelligible and the language less cumbersome, but they should not be taken literally.
   in sec. ii, we discuss the use of the principle of least action27  associated with the integral

this is because, for a parametrically-invariant action, the action functional takes on the same form,

8

the variation is taken to vanish identically, i.e.,   i = 0.  since the variations of the parameter s at

the end points do not vanish,27   this leads not only to lagranges equations but also to a set of

natural boundary conditions28 of the form             

2 ( s 1 ) = 0 ,           p i 
p i 

2 ( s 2 ) = 0,   i = 1, 2, 3,  . . . , n.                              (1.4)
these natural boundary conditions (n.b.c.) result in a form of spontaneous symmetry breaking,
for they are a part of the dynamical system.12  the lagrange equations of motion are invariant
under a larger group of transformations than the n.b.c., for example, contact transformations. 
thus, the variational principle selects out special coordinate frames.  we shall assume that these
frames are correlated with the fact that we, the observers, are made of the same particles that we
observe, and the variational principle is applied to the sets of coordinates which represent
observable (composite) particles.
   for the model in this paper, the n.b.c. yield the necessary subsidiary conditions to suppress
unwanted time oscillations and provide mass-shell constraints for composite particles, that is, the
klein-gordon equations p 2 = m 2 .  as we shall see in sec. iv, the n.b.c. also prohibit composites
consisting of mixtures of lepton and hadron quarks.
   in sec. iii, a harmonic-oscillator potential is adopted. the lagrangian in an arbitrary lorentz
frame is

 l( s ) =  m 7     g q ( s )  2 q a  2 ( s ) +  q a ( s ) gq( s )  2 ? 1 / 2 ,                       (1.5)

where m is a constant parameter and g is a numerical dimensionless matrix yielding a harmonic-
oscillator interaction.  the variable s is an evolution parameter.  in the past, such parameters have
sometimes been associated with proper time.  we do not do so, and later find that s is
unmeasurable.  the variable q(s) is a vector whose components are the individual quark position
four-vectors.  for simplicity, the quarks are taken to be spinless.  the harmonic-oscillator coupling
matrix g  is chosen to describe two identical but noninteracting systems that we shall denote as the
lepton and hadron quarks, respectively.  composite particles, i.e., leptons and hadrons, can be
formed by appropriate initial conditions on quark solutions.  the solutions imply a lepton-hadron
symmetry we do not see in nature.  also, the composites in this version of the model do not
interact among themselves.  therefore, we have two reasons to consider the symmetry as only
approximate.  just as for quantum field theory, we modify the lagrangian so that spontaneous
symmetry breaking provides the interactions between particles as well as breaking unwanted
symmetries.
   in sec. iv, the harmonic-oscillator potential of sec. iii is modified by a familiar prescription. 
an infinitesimal positive imaginary part, proportional to i  , is added to the parameter m and the

9

coupling matrix g .  this leads to a new harmonic-oscillator quark model which is still
characterized by a symmetry under the interchange of coordinates.  however, these are
transformed to a new set of coordinates designated as the quark coordinates and yields the
lagrangian

l =  m 

: ;

( s )   hq  ( s ) 

1 / 2 
2 b c 
d 

.                         (1.6)

the original symmetry becomes hidden:  the coupling matrix h is not symmetric under the
interchange of lepton and hadron quarks.  the principle of least action applied to (1.6) yields a
set of natural boundary conditions (n.b.c.) that suppress unwanted time oscillations and ensure the
mass-shell relations p2=m2 for composite particles.  it also restricts composites to leptons and
hadrons (no mixed states).  quark masses have no meaning in this model, except in the
asymptotic regions of s, where they could be considered as being zero (see (1.4)).  curiously, the
quarks also become strings in those asymptotic regions (their frequencies of oscillation tend to
infinity as  6 0). 
   a set of dirac constraints results from this string-like lagrangian that are used to construct a
dirac hamiltonian29 and thus a quantized theory.  the hamiltonian is characterized by an arbitrary
gauge parameter which we take to be inversely proportional to  .  for the strong interaction

lagrangian, the constraints are automatically satisfied by the n.b.c. (the converse is not true).  the
general formalism is discussed in sec. iv, and the equations of motion are solved.  the n.b.c.,
which are part of the dynamical system, imply a reformulation of the usual completeness relations. 
the nature of the solutions of (1.6) lead to new transformations between dynamically allowed
states in the position and momentum representations.  
   the harmonic-oscillator potential allows  cluster decomposition, i.e., distant kinematically
uncorrelated systems of unrestricted numbers of quarks, and thus any number of virtual particles. 
in the interest of simplicity, the clusters considered in this paper are limited to systems of four
quarks.  these, in turn, lead to the elastic scattering of like composite particles by quark exchange.
   feynman30 demonstrated that quantum mechanics and special relativity (in the sense of
restricting the velocity of observable particles to less than c) requires the existence of antiparticles. 
here, we have the situation that the quark velocities are not restricted, although the velocities of the
observable composites are.  nevertheless, in sec. iv we define antiquarks in analogy to
antiparticles.  quark-antiquark confinement appears as part of the physical initial conditions in the
harmonic-oscillator model, but once imposed in the observers initial state, follows also in the final
state.
    the strong interaction scattering of like composites is considered in sec. v.  a new

10

interpretation of the state vector      arises and must be considered when calculating scattering

amplitudes.  it also impacts on the interpretation of quantum mechanics. the relativistic state vector
   can be interpreted as an extension of the nonrelativistic time-independent state vector    x  
which contains information for all values of x.  in the present case, the parametric invariance of the
lagrangian implies there is no evolution of the system in the parameter s (because of the vanishing
of the hamiltonian).  nevertheless, the state vectors for the system contain complete information
about the particles at the observers times t =" 4.  thus, the states cannot be completely specified
by the physical initial conditions at t = -4.   in fact, even both initial and final physical
measurements together do not specify the state vector completely.  the remaining parameters must
be summed over in calculating the overlap of possible initial and final states.
   the lepton composites can scatter only in the forward or backward directions, which for these
identical particles is tantamount to no scattering at all.  the hadrons scatter at other angles as well. 
hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes are calculated and take a veneziano type form characteristic
of dual models:24

the orbital angular momentum is always zero in this simple model (discussed shortly), resulting in
constant residues for poles in s, t, and u.
    it will be demonstrated in sec. v that the scattered composite particles carry no memory of the
interaction, save for the usual conservation laws of four-momentum and angular momentum.  thus
composites from different (uncorrelated) clusters may be used to provide the basis states for the
unperturbed hamiltonian in the electroweak domain.
  now let us add some comments about the origin of (1) the absence of background reference
frame, (2) no decomposition h=h0+hi, and (3) the zero orbital angular momentum of the
composites.  these all stem from the addition of the infinitesimal parameter   to the harmonic-
oscillator model, one result of which is that the quark position vectors are singular as  6 0. 
(matrix elements are always calculated before going to the limit  = 0.)  in compensation, the

volume in space-time within which the interaction takes place (defined by finite values of s) goes to

11

zero as  6 0.  this also implies a direct collision of the composites. 
   the singular nature of the quark coordinates plays an important role.  the strong scattering of
like composites takes place in a special coordinate frame (although lorentz covariance is
maintained), namely the frame in which the variational principle is applied.  (it is in this frame, for
this model, that the quark momenta and position vectors are aligned, i.e., the composites have zero
orbital angular momentum.)  on the other hand, the original fundamental lagrangian, obtained by
modifying the lepton-hadron symmetric lagrangian of sec. iii, is expressed in coordinates for
which the total four-momentum and angular momentum of the quark system vanishes. 
furthermore, the total center-of-mass vector plays no role in the scattering of observable composite
particles.  as a result, the composite coordinates, both external and internal, are all relational. 

there is no background frame of reference.   this has an important significance when final states
representing free composite particles are used as the unperturbed basis states for subsequent
interactions.  we shall see in sec. v that, in combination the role of the observer and the n.b.c., it
implies a modification of the transformations between momentum and position representations.
one result is the exclusion of advanced electroweak potentials which, in turn, allows the
subsequent derivation of feynman propagators and feynman diagrams.
     in sec. vi, the electroweak interactions are considered.  the lagrangian becomes

l ( s ) =  7   a ( q ( s ) )  2 q a 2 ( s ) +    a ( q ( s ) ) a q a ( s )  2 ? 1 / 2 .                            (1.9)

in choosing an expression for a(q), ones first impulse is to borrow from the classical wheeler-
feynman model of action-at-a-distance electrodynamics.16,17  however, it appears that a wheeler-
feynman type potential can yield feynmans rules for electromagnetic but not weak scattering
amplitudes.  interestingly, as is shown, the wheeler-feynman potential can be regarded as a four-
dimensional generalization of a simple one-dimensional problem, namely, the nonrelativistic
collision of two point particles.  this one-dimensional problem can be formulated in other ways. 
we generalize the simplest of these alternatives to four-dimensional space-time because it leads to a
true unification of the electrodynamic and the weak interactions which yields feynman
diagrams.  
    first-order perturbation theory is applied to an example of spinless lepton-lepton elastic
scattering (the analogous hadron-hadron scattering can be similarly formulated).  the unperturbed
states are assumed to be asymptotic harmonic-oscillator lepton states generated from the harmonic-
oscillator domains.  with the aid of the new completeness relations, the dirac propagator  

f ( x ) for

the klein-gordon equation is derived, and feynman rules follow.  there are no advanced
potentials.
   finally, in order to make a connection to the usual understanding of supersymmetry, internal

spin variables are briefly discussed in sec. vii.  a second spin phase space is added to the phase
space of quark particles.  the composite particles in this model are composed of pairs of quarks,
leading to leptons and hadrons with half-integral and integral spin, respectively.  the leptons and
hadrons share the same mass spectrum. 

ii.  variational  principle  and  natural  boundary  conditions

   consider a system of n particles described by coordinates qi(s) and velocities q a 
i ( s ) = dqi(s)/ds,
with i = 1, 2,  3,   . . . ,  n.  the variable s is an evolution parameter.  assume the lagrangian l
is a known function of qi(s) and q a 
vanishes, or

i ( s ) and is nonstandard.  that is, the canonical hamiltonian

 l  q i ( s ) , q a 

i ( s )   

p i ( s )  qa 

i ( s ) = 0 ,                                           (2.1)

i = 1 

where p i  /   m l / m q a

i ( s )   .                              (2.2)

now consider a path c n differing infinitesimally from c and calculate the variation

 i / i [ c ' ]  i [ c ] .                                                          (2.3)

the   variation needs to be specified.  in view of (2.1) and (2.2), we shall adopt the variational

procedure used for a different integral associated with standard lagrangians and defined as

s

i ( s ) ds,                                                     (2.4)

the variational principle is sometimes known as the principle of least action.27  the
displacements of qi(s) and q a 
i ( s ) are affected only by the speeding up or slowing down of each
variable as a function of s, leaving the varied path consistent with the physical motion.  thus, the 
 -process includes a variation of s even at the end points, but the variation of the qis remain zero.
we consider the variations

n ( s ) / q i ( s ) +  
q i 

i  q i ( s ),                                                   (2.5)

where

we have also

   now compute the first-order change in the action functional i in going from c to c n:

the last step was obtained by integrating by parts.
   we now assume the total variation vanishes,31 i.e.,

 i = 0 .                                                                   (2.9)

the variations

i s are taken to be arbitrary and independent, and the end points s1 and s2 are

i ( s ) are not identically zero), it follows

that

the last two conditions are known as the natural boundary conditions.28  we shall denote them as
the n.b.c.
   the form of the lagrange equations (2.10) is invariant under contact transformations.  that is,
for canonical transformations to a new set of coordinates qi and pi such that

p i dq i

i 

p i dq i.                                                    (2.12)

14

2=0.  then, at least, the n.b.c. are invariant

however, the n.b.c. are not form invariant under such transformations.   thus, the variational
principle selects out special coordinate systems.  for quark solutions in the harmonic-oscillator
model of secs. iii and iv, the n.b.c. take the form pi
under the lorentz transformations.  to see what kind of special frame might be involved here, let
us consider the choices of coordinates employed in nonrelativistic classical mechanics for standard
lagrangians.  for a system of n particles, we assign, on the basis of what we observe (measure), a
set of coordinates xi(t) and their derivatives x  ( t ) = dx / dt.  we might then choose, for reasons of
convenience in solving equations, say, to make a transformation to a different set of coordinates, to
which we, of course, dont assign a particle interpretation.  thus arises the concept of
generalized coordinates.  the variation principle assumed for standard lagrangians includes the
assumption of no variation at the end points, and therefore gives equivalent descriptions in the two
cases:  it does not select out which set of coordinates correspond to the real particle coordinates. 
   for the nonstandard lagrangians, let us then assume that the variational principle described in
this section is to be applied only to lagrangians expressed in terms of real particle coordinates and
their derivatives.  in other words, it is assumed that the variational principle is based on a particle
ontology.
   we must now add a caveat, however.  the above assumption is based on the fact that we, by the
act of observation (measurement) necessarily have a built-in bias.  by all appearances, we and our
measuring devices consist of the same kinds of particles we measure.  this may imply that we are
incapable of direct measurement of other kinds of particles, but it doesnt preclude their
existence.  as we shall see, the results of the model in the present paper re-enforce that viewpoint:
we find that observable particles in imply observable particles out, but the existence of other
kinds of particles are part of the model.  thus, we shall assume that the lagrangian in terms of
measurable particle coordinates is not necessarily the fundamental lagrangian.
   this version of the variational principle has not been adopted before for nonstandard lagrangians
in particle physics, and, even without considering the lack of form invariance under contact
transformations, its not hard to see why.  if it is applied for ordinary relativistic particles, it can
lead to inconsistencies.  for example, consider the relativistic lagrangian for a free particle (setting
the mass equal to unity):

l =  x a 2 ( s )  1 / 2 .                                                          (2.13)

the conjugate momentum is

which yields the constraint

p = 

x a ( s ) 
x a 2 ( s )  1 / 2  ,                                                        (2.14) 

15

p 2 = 1 .                                                                 (2.15)

this is in contradiction with the n.b.c.  (recall the comments in the introduction concerning the
assumptions of free particles in theory construction.)  we shall see in the following sections that,
for quark coordinates, such inconsistencies do not arise.  in fact, the n.b.c. for our relativistic
model produce the orthogonality conditions necessary to ensure the suppression of unwanted time
oscillations and composite particle mass-shell constraints p2=m2.
   not only is there a close connection between the choice of frame for application of the variational
principle and observable particles, but there is a primary significance to be considered once the
system is quantized.  that is because the n.b.c. are a part of the dynamical system.  the complete
set of solutions for the equations of motion are not the complete set of solutions for the dynamical
system.  thus, it is necessary to revise formulations involving complete sets of states
(completeness relations).

iii.    the  first  step:    a  lepton-hadron  symmetric  quark  model

a.    nonstandard  stringlike  lagrangian

and  corresponding  dirac  hamiltonian

  
   consider a system of 4n quarks described by coordinates q ia ( s ) and q 

  ia ( s ) / dq ia ( s ) / ds,

where i=1, 2, 3, ... , n, and a=1, 2, 3, 4.  for simplicity, the quarks are assumed to be spinless. 
the parameter s is an evolution parameter.  the metric is g00=1 = - gii.  we assume a nonstandard
lagrangian in an arbitrary lorentz frame which leaves the action parametrically invariant:

l ( s ) =  7 m 2      gq( s )  2    q 

  
  2 ( s  )      +  q 
  ( s )   a   gq( s )    

2  ? 1 / 2 

.                       (3.1)

we have set  h / = c = 1, m is a constant parameter, and

the coupling matrix g is given by

g / g q n ,                                                                (3.3)

note that g = g2. 
   the momentum conjugate to q is

   ( gq) 2 q a + ( q a gq) gq  .                                 (3.5)

    the first term under the square root in the lagrangian (3.1) is usually identified as vt, or the
potential times the kinetic energy.  models closely similar to (3.1) and the broken symmetry
lagrangian of the next section are considered in reference 26.  in these earlier models, the
lagrangians took the form  l =   vt , and in that case the only dirac constraint is h . 0 .
   expanding the potential term in (3.1),  we obtain the familiar harmonic oscillator form

   we shall denote the a=1 and a=3 quarks as lepton quarks, and the a=2 and a=4 quarks as
hadron quarks.  examination of the matrix g then shows that l describes two identical but
independent systems.  in other words, l remains unchanged under the simultaneous interchanges 
q i 1 : q i 3 ,   q i 2 : q i 4 .  thus this symmetry will be referred to as lepton-hadron quark symmetry. 

     the lagrangian (3.1) bears a striking resemblance to the lagrangian for a free string:24

l (  ,  ) =  7  x n 2 (  ,  )   x a 2 (  ,  ) +  x a (  ,  ) a x n (  ,  )   

2 ? 1 / 2

where x is a function of proper time   and string parameter  ,   0 #  #  

0 .   the derivatives are

defined as

x   (  ,  ) / dx(  ,  ) / d  ;      x n (  ,  ) = dx(  ,  ) / d  .                                      (3.8)

the analogy to the free string is discussed at length in the first paper of ref. 26.
   returning to the quark model, we observe that the nonstandard l in (3.1) implies the vanishing
of the canonical hamiltonian. we turn to diracs theory of constraints29  to construct a
hamiltonian.  the lagrangian (3.1) gives rise to two primary constraints:

 
1 / p 2 + m 2 qg 2 q . 0 ,          

2 / pgq . 0 .                                 (3.9)

these may be used to construct a tentative hamiltonian, h = v 1 
consider questions of consistency.
   the equation of motion for a function f(q,p) is given by

 

+ v 2 

 

2 , but we must now

  . 7 f , h ?                                                             (3.10)

with the poisson brackets defined as

7 f , h ? /

.                                            (3.11)

taking f to be  

2 , we know that  a 

2  must be zero for consistency.  we set
7  

2 ? = 2  

1 ,  

3 . 0 ,                                                        (3.12)

where we have defined

 
3   / pgp  m 2 qgq,                                               (3.13)

and we have used g3=g.  thus, we obtain the secondary constraint  

3 . 0.

   the hamiltonian is now modified to be

h = 

3 
3 
i = 1 

 

v i 

i                                                           (3.14)

once more, consistency requires

this yields the conditions

7  

i , h ? . 0 ,   i = 1 , 2 , 3 .                                                   (3.15)

v 2  pgp + m 2 qgq  . 0 .
v 3  pgp + m 2 qgq  . 0 ,                                               (3.16)

18

thus, to avoid adding a further constraint, set v 2 

= v 3 

= 0.  choosing a gauge v1= /  2 m   =

constant, we have

h = 

 
2 m 

[   p 2 + m 2 qg 2 q   ] .                                               (3.17)

 
the equations of motion q 

  
  = m h / m p  and p 
  
  
  =   2   g 2 q     and    p   =  m /   q 
q 

  =  m h / m q yield

.                                         (3.18)

   in order to solve these equations, it is convenient to transform to a set of normal coordinates. 
to  this end, we note that the matrix g can be diagonalized by either of the following matrices 
  or  :

we shall work with the matrix   (it is easily shown that   leads to equivalent results).  define a

transformation to a set of 4n coordinates:

q ia / y ia

+ n  1 / 2 {  w } a ,           with 

n 
 y ia   =   0 .                               (3.21)
3 
i = 1 

the latter condition brings the number of coordinates back to 4n. 
    in terms of the transformed coordinates, the conjugate momentum in (3.18) becomes

a 
=  m /   q 

ia

p ia

=  m /   y a 

ia

a 
+ n  1 / 2 {  w 

} a  .                                (3.22)

this suggests defining momenta corresponding to yia and wa by

19

p ia /    m /   y a

i = 1 

p ia

p ia

= p ia

+ n  1 / 2 {  p } a .                                                  (3.25)

and

then, we can write

   the hamiltonian (3.17) can now be expressed as

 p a

2  .                   (3.26)

the variables pia and pa are, in fact, conjugate to ya and wa, respectively.  the hamiltonian or
the equations (3.18) can be used to calculate the equations of motion

=   2 w a , 

    a = 3 ,   4 .             (3.27)

b.  quantized  solutions

   we shall quantize by imposing the commutation relations

   y ia , p ia  =  i g   ,     i = 1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   ...,  n  1 ;

w a  , p a   =  i g   ,    a = 1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   4 .                                  (3.28)

(note that if we let index i run from 1 to n, there would be a contradiction.  however, we can
exclude the coordinates yna and pna by using (3.21) and (3.23).)
     in the heisenberg picture, the equations of motion o      =  i [ o , h ] yield equations (3.27). 
express the solutions as follows:

y ia

= a ias + b ia,                 p ia

=  m /   a ia;

w a 

= a a s + b a ,                  p a 

=  m /   a a ,       a = 1 ,   2 :

w a 
=  i  m / 2  1 / 2  a a 
the commutation relations (3.28) imply

p a 

=  2 m

   examining these solutions, it is apparent that pairs of quarks in either system can be paired up by
boundary or initial conditions into composite particles.  for example, setting ai2=ai4 and bi2=bi4
yields a system of hadron composites described by

q h

in similar fashion, we can compose lepton composites q l

i ,   and q l

c.  natural  boundary  conditions  and  the  lagrangian  constraints

    as we indicated in sec. ii, application of the variational principle implies preferred reference
frames, and we have assumed these frames are those for which the coordinates are the position and
velocity vectors of real particles.  application of the variational principle to the lagrangian (3.1)
yields a set of natural boundary conditions (n.b.c.), which can be re-expressed in terms of the
quark momenta as

p ia

2 ( s )   -   0    as s 6 " 4 ,                                                 (3.36)

where pia(s) is given by (3.32) or (3.33).
   in going over to the quantized model, one might expect to write the n.b.c. as

2 ( s )    - 0     as s 6 " 4   .                                              (3.37)

p ia

however, the commutation relations (3.28) lead to inconsistencies.  thus, in analogy to oscillator
constraint relations in quantum field theory, we apply the n.b.c. in the following form:

+    n m  1 / 2 a 1 

a ia
2    = 0 ,                  a ia

  a a 

+    n m  1 / 2 a 2 

a ia
2    = 0 ,                  a ia

a a 

+  2 n  

2    =    2 / 4 nm   a 3 
 1 / 2 a 1  a a 3 
2    =    2 / 4 nm   a 4 
 1 / 2 a 2  a a 4 

+  2 n  

 a 3 

 

,   

   

+ a 3   a 3 
  =   0 ,     a = 1 ,   3 ;   
+ a 4   a 4 

   

 a 4 
  = 0 ,     a = 2 ,   4 .                (3.38)

, 

 2 = 0 ,  etc., so that the expectation value of pia

the equations in (3.38) imply     a a 
s 6 " 4.
    the eigenstates of h can be labeled by the eigenvalues of aia, aa, and n a /  a a 
the composite solutions such as (3.34), the n.b.c. contain the mass-shell conditions

2(s) is zero as

 a a.  then, for

 p i 

2 =  m 

n   a a 

 a a 

+ a a a a 

  =  2 m / n   n a 

+ 2  .                                (3.39)

the n.b.c. also imply that for a positive mass-squared composite particle in its rest frame

  a a 0 

  =   a a 0    a ia, a a , n a 

= 0.                                           (3.40)

in other words, there are no time oscillations in the rest frame of positive mass-squared particles.

       using the relation 

n 
3 
i = 1 

a ia

= 0, we can recast the hamiltonian (3.31) as

22

h =

n 
3 
i = 1

3

2 + 

4 
3 
a = 3 

 a a 

 a a 

+ a a a a 

  .               (3.41)

substitution of the mass-shell conditions in (3.38) into (3.41) implies that h=0 can be satisfied
only if

 

4 
3 
a = 3 

 a a 

 a a 

+ a a  a a 

  =  2 

4 
3 
a = 3 

 n a 

+ 2  = 0.                                  (3.42)

thus, for a system of lepton and hadron composites, one or both types of composites must have
negative squared mass.
     consider now the constraint problem.  rephrase the  
1 / p 2 + m 2 qg 2 q ,

                                                           

i in terms of quantized operators:

 

1 
2   pgq + qgp  , 
2 / 

substitution of the solutions (3.21), (3.25), and (3.29) into the last two relations yields

    

3 /  pgp  qgq  .                                                     (3.43)

a = 3 

 p a w a 

+ w a p a  = i

a = 3 

 2 exp  2 i  s  + a a 
a a 

2  exp   2 i  s  .               (3.45)

thus,  

2 . 0 and  

3 . 0 are satisfied by the n.b.c. (note that the converse is not true, i.e., the

constraint relations above do not imply the n.b.c.).

iv.  harmonic  oscillator  quark  model 
with  spontaneous  broken  symmetry

a.  breaking  the  lepton-hadron  symmetry

   the lepton-hadron symmetric lagrangian (3.1) must be modified in order to obtain a description
of interacting composite particles.  this is accomplished here, not by the addition of an interaction
term, but by adopting an analog to the familiar prescription of adding a positive infinitesimal
imaginary part to the mass in particle scattering problems.  we shall find that as a result, the lepton-

hadron symmetry is broken and we are led to a more realistic model.
   we begin by replacing the harmonic oscillator potential of (3.6) by

the new coupling matrix h is defined as

h / g + i  d,                                                              (4.2)

= d 2 .                                                   (4.3)

since g a d = d a g = 0, we have

h  h = g 2 +  2 d 2 .                                                           (4.4)

note that if we define a real matrix h    / g +  d ,  then h    2 =   h  h.
  thus we have modified the symmetric lagrangian (3.1) by the replacements g 6 h and
m 6    1 + i   m.  the limit  6 0 is to be taken after calculation of a matrix element.  note that v
retains a symmetry analogous to that of lagrangian (3.1), i.e., it is symmetric under the exchange 
x i 1 : x i 2  and x i 3 : x i 4 .  because the potential exhibits this basic symmetry, we shall regard the
coordinates xia(s) as a set of fundamental  coordinates, but not the coordinates of the quarks which
constitute measurable composite particles (see the discussion in sec. ii).
   the matrix h  h (or the matrix h n) is diagonalized, not by the matrix   in the hadron-lepton
symmetric model, but by the matrix defined below:

rather than solve for the coordinates xia, however, we shall make a transformation to what will be
defined as the quark coordinates qia:

q /   q 1  x ,                                                           (4.5)

note that  a  =   and   1 g  = g .   
   the potential can now be put into the form

where

v =  m hq  2                                                        (4.7)

the matrix n is given by (3.4).  note that f a g = g a f = 0.
   the stringlike lagrangian to which the variational principle will be applied becomes

l =  7 m 2    hq  2  q

a 
a 2 +   q

hq  2  ? 1 / 2 .                                  (4.10)

this lagrangian does not display a symmetry under q i 1 : q i 2 ,  q i 3 : q i 4 .  the momentum
conjugate to q is

   the nonstandard lagrangians (3.1) and (4.10) do not yield hamiltonians, but only constraints. 
however, contrary to the parallel problems in gravity11 and string theory,24,13,19,20 this does not
complicate the quantization procedure for either lagrangian.  to construct a hamiltonian
corresponding to (4.10), we turn again to diracs formulation of the constraint problem.29  two
primary constraints result from l:

 
1 / p 2 + m 2  hq  2 . 0,                                              (4.12)

begin by taking the hamiltonian to be  h = v 1

where we define

now modify the hamiltonian to read

 
3 / pgp  m 2 qgq.                                                 (4.15)

 4 m 2 pgq  v 1 

 2  pgp + m 2 qgq  v 2 . 0 .                             (4.17)

thus, for a nontrivial solution for the vis, we must add at least one more constraint.  further
examination of the constraint procedure shows that the least restrictive solution is obtained by
setting v2=v3=v4=0 and defining a secondary constraint (to first order)

 

4 / pgp . 0.                                                          (4.18)

26

finally, choosing a gauge v1= / 2 m, we take the dirac hamiltonian to be

h =   / 2 m  p 2 + m 2  hq  2  .                                          (4.19)

yield

the choice of normalization implies that yia and w2 become singular as  6 0.  thus, a
decomposition of h=h0+hi has no meaning, since  y ia and  w 2  remain finite.  in quantizing,
these singularities are not a problem if we work in the momentum representation and not allow the
limit  6 0 to be taken until after calculation of a matrix element.  the physical interpretation of the
position space as  6 0 will be given later when composite scattering is considered.
    the commutation relations (4.28) imply

a ia , b ia  = i   g   ;     a 2  , b 2   = i   g   ;

    if, at this point, we were to impose the constraint h=0, we would obtain from the above an
expression for   depending on the various eigenvalues aia, bia, etc.  this would imply that each
final state quark carries a memory of the process which created them.  furthermore, the
parameter   introduces an infinitesimal repulsive harmonic-oscillator potential.  to avoid these
problems, we shall choose the gauge parameter   as follows:

 =  

0 

/  .                                                             (4.32)

later, we shall see that this is equivalent to an absence of a background frame of reference for the
fundamental coordinates xia.  in view of this gauge choice,  we can replace, to first  order,
commutation relations in (4.28) by the following:

a ia , b ia  = 0 ;              a 2  , b 2   = 0 .                                          (4.33)

now the exponential terms in the earlier solutions become

exp  "   s  = exp  

 "    

 .      (4.34)
the second of these relations shows that, as   tends to zero, the oscillation frequency of the quarks

 ,         exp  " i ( 1 + i  )  s  = exp  

 " i ( 1 + i  )  

0 s /    

0 s  

tends to infinity.  that is, the quarks approach becoming closed strings, mapping out tubes in
space time.  it is important to note that these strings are not physically extended objects.   in
other words, they are not the strings of string theories.   as a result, the problem of an infinite
number of constraints (nonclosure of the constraint algebra) is avoided, and the theory is
formulated consistently in four dimensional space time.

  the choice of gauge (4.32) allows us to drop the term p 1 

2 =  m 2 /  2  a 1 

2  in (4.26) and (4.31). 

to first order, we now can write the hamiltonian as

h =

this is a significant result, for if the term p1

2 had to be retained, the frequency would depend on

c.  the  natural  boundary  conditions  (n.b.c.)

   the variational principle of sec. ii applied to the lagrangian (4.10) yields the classical natural
boundary conditions (n.b.c.)

with the momentum pia(s) given by (4.25).  before applying the n.b.c., consider again the
solutions (4.29).  the oscillatory variables wa and pa, a=3, 4, are complex numbers.  we shall
therefore implicitly understand them to be replaced with the variables (1/2)(wa+wa
(1/2)(pa+pa

) and

this would appear to present a problem, for a ia  and a  
ia  are supposed to be constant operators. 
however, we have not, up till now, discussed the order of limit taking for s and  .  we shall adopt

the following prescription, while not mathematically rigorous, gives us a set of rules with which to
work, as long as they are applied consistently.  we shall always assume    is finite as s

approaches the asymptotic regions " 4.  the matrix elements are then calculated, and finally we
allow   to go to zero.  thus, as s 6 " 4 in (4.38), we have

lim s 6 " 4  a a  , a a  

  = 0 ,   for     0.                                            (4.39)

in other words, for     0, and in the asymptotic regions, we treat a ia  and a  
operators. 
   with the replacements (4.37), the hamiltonian is only approximately constant in s, of course,

we will use this form of h in sec. vi to go from the heisenberg picture to the schro  dinger picture
for application of electroweak perturbation techniques.
    we need now to discuss the labeling of states.  in the limit  6 0,  we can take the set of
commuting variables aia, bia, a2, b2, and na/  a a 

 a a, and write

  / a ia, b ia,  a 2 ,  b 2 ,  n a 

.                                             (4.41)
we shall retain this labeling for the asymptotic states even in the case   0, since to first order aia
and bia still commute.
              returning now to the n.b.c., we follow the procedure of sec.iii and write the quantized
conditions as follows:

  = 0 .         (4.43)

31

d.  satisfaction  of  the  dirac  constraints  by  the  n.b.c.

   we write the quantized versions of the constraints as

 
1 / p 2 +  m 2 qh 2 q . 0 ,         

 

1 
2   phq + qhp  . 0 ,
2 / 

3 / pgp  m 2 qgq . 0 ,

2   pgp + qgp  . 0 .                                             (4.44)
4 / 

it is not difficult to demonstrate that the solutions (4.29), along with the n.b.c., ensure the
vanishing of  

4 .  thus, aside from the condition h . 0, all constraints are automatically

2 ,    

3 ,  

satisfied by the application of the n.b.c. (the converse is not true).
   one might ask, then, why not keep the simpler lagrangian of the form l =  vt ?  one answer
lies in the possibility of generalizing the lagrangian to describe other forces.  for example, write

l =  7   f ( q )  2 q a 2 +  f ( q ) a q a  2 ? 1 / 2 ,                                      (4.45)

where f(q) takes on different forms depending on the conditions of the domain of space-time
being considered.  in sec.vi, in a domain where the electroweak forces dominate, l is assumed to
take the form

 l  =    7   a ( q )  2  q

a 2   +    a ( q ) a q 

a  2   ? 1 / 2 ,                                (4.46)

where a(q) is the electroweak potential.  this lagrangian is used to calculate spinless lepton-
lepton electroweak scattering amplitudes.

e.  quark-antiquark  assumption

  the variables wa, which are shared by different quarks, can be considered associated with the
internal symmetries of the composite leptons and hadrons.  in earlier work,26  the coefficients of
w1 and w2 were denoted as the p and x numbers respectively, and the coefficients of w3 and w4
as the l and b numbers, respectively.  the leptons (hadrons) are composed are composed of pairs
of quarks of the same p (x) number and opposite l (b) number.
   there has been nothing in the formulation thus far that implies the necessity for what could be
termed antiquarks.  feynman30 gives a nice demonstration of why quantum mechanics and the

32

relativistic restriction of particle velocities less than c require the existence of antiparticles. 
however, the quark velocities of this model are not so restricted, although the velocities of the
observable composites are.
    in order to produce composite particles which are accompanied by corresponding antiparticles,
we shall introduce a definition of an antiquark.  recall that an electron going backward in time can
be re-interpreted as a positron of opposite spin going forward in time.  now consider the variables
qia(-s) which describe quarks going the reverse sense in the variable s:
lepton quarks

0 s   

a  2 

   

=     y ia( s ) + 

1 

2   nm

      (4.48)

in both (4.47) and (4.48), we have set  y ia( s ) /  y ia(  s ).  in the asymptotic regions of s, 
w 1 (  s ) plays no role.  thus, lepton quarks going backwards in s can be reinterpreted as quarks
with opposite internal angular momentum going forward in s.  in the case of the hadron quarks,
consider solutions for which

a 2 

= b 2 .                                                               (4.49)
for these solutions, the hadron quarks going backwards in s can be reinterpreted the same way. 
we shall define such solutions as antiquarks and postulate that the quarks that constitute initial-state
observable hadrons correspond to solutions satisfying (4.49).  therefore, the hadrons can be
thought of as composed of quark and antiquark.
   in the next section, it will be seen that w1 plays no role in the strong scattering of leptons.  the
condition a2 = b2 is necessary for the conservation of four-momentum in hadron scattering. it also
leads to final state hadrons similarly composed of quark-antiquark pairs.
   it is important to note that hadron-hadron four-momentum conservation is not built in by a basic
symmetry of the lagrangian, but is closely tied to the particle-antiparticle requirements of quantum
mechanics and special relativity.

33

f.    the  absence  of  a  background  frame  of  reference

  at the beginning of this section, we assumed the xia to be the fundamental in the sense that the
lagrangian in these coordinates display a basic symmetry x i 1 : x i 2 ,   x i 3 : x i 4 .  the solutions for xia
are easily obtained from (4.5) and (4.22). they take the form

x ia

= 7  y i ? a 

+ n  1 / 2 7  w ? a .                                               (4.50)

the momenta, which we will define as pia, are similarly obtained:

+ n  1 / 2 7  p ? a .                                               (4.51)

p ia

= 7  p i ? a 
from (4.50), we obtain a center-of-mass vector

w 1 ,                                             (4.52)

 while (4.51) yields the total momentum

we see from the solution in (4.29) for w1 that the center-of-mass vector plays no role in the
formation of composite particles in the asymptotic regions s 6 " 4.  from the solution for p1 in
(4.29) and the gauge choice (4.32), it follows that the total momentum p vanishes as  6 0.  in
similar manner, the total angular momentum vanishes also. thus, there is no background frame of
reference.  all composite variables are expressed in terms of relational coordinates.

g.    representations  and  completeness  relations

     the natural boundary conditions (n.b.c.) imply that the solutions of the dynamical  system are a
aa.
subset of the simultaneous eigenstates of the commuting operators aia, bia, a2, b2, and na=-aa
dirac21 defines a complete set of eigenvalues of a real dynamical variable as just the possible
results of measurements of that dynamical variable.  let us modify that definition: the complete set
of eigenvalues of a set of commuting real dynamical variables is determined by the possible
solutions of the dynamical system.  to see what that implies for the present model, let us first look
a the simple case of a lepton quark formed as s 6 + 4.  the results are easily generalized to hadron
quarks.  label the eigenstates of aia and n3 which satisfy n.b.c. conditions (4.42) as  a ia, n 3 

. 

34

that is, these states satisfy

a 3 

2  a ia, n 3 

= 0 ,  and a iaa a 3  a ia, n 3 

= 0 .                                     (4.54)

we must, of course, also include the mass shell condition in (4.42).  we do this by defining the
completeness relation

examination of the expression for pia in (4.29) indicates that,  as s 6 + 4,  a ia,  n  3   is an
eigenstate of pia 
   until now we have paid little attention to the position vector yia.  as we shall see in the next
section, such a representation for hadron-hadron or lepton-lepton scattering plays no role in the
calculation of the strong-interaction scattering amplitudes.  however, in sec. vi, we will look at
perturbation theory applied to electroweak scattering. there, we will use the asymptotic harmonic-
oscillator states as the unperturbed states and introduce the position representation as intermediate
states.  from (4.29), we see that yia is proportional to aia/ , and thus is singular as  6 0. 
however, since   is kept finite until a matrix element is calculated, we can define a position

representation when the states are summed over as intermediate states in the matrix element.
   we shall label the position states as s 6 + 4 as  a ia

   in order to make the transformation from the position representation to the momentum
representation, we need an expression for

35

a ia

 .                                                     (4.59)

to that end, let us consider the usual derivation of  y ia p ia  for finite s. we have the

commutation relation

p ia y ia  y ia p ia = ig   .                                                      (4.60)

substitution of the solutions (4.29) for yia and pia yields

p ia y ia  y ia p ia

this implies the commutation relation  a ia   ,   b ia  = i  g   , given in (4.30).  as expected, in the
asymptotic regions s 6 " 4, the leading terms of the operators yia and pia commute.  however, it is
in this region that yia becomes singular and thus unmeasurable.
   in the position representation, the operator pia is represented by

y ia p ia = i 

m

  y ia .                                                   (4.62)

therefore, it follows that

p ia  y ia p ia

  y ia p ia .                              (4.63)

the solution to this differential equation has the form

= const. h exp   i y iap ia  .                                           (4.64)
we shall assume this expression holds for the present model both for finite s and for s 6 " 4, with
the caveat that the constant of proportionality might be zero.

however, consider the equation below (we use boldface to indicate an operator):

a ia n  a ia /  ,   n 3  a ia n , n 3 

=  a ia /  ,   n 3  a ia  a ia n , n 3 

.                         (4.66)

now, if x = y, we cannot infer x /  = y /  ,  but only20

x 
 

= y 
 

+ c  (  ) ,                                                         (4.67)

where c is unknown.  thus, dividing both sides of (4.66) by   yields

 

    a ia n 
 

 

 a ia 
 

 
     a ia /  ,   n 3  a ia n , n 3 
 

= c    .                                 (4.68)

multiplying the above by   then gives us

 a ia n  a ia   a ia /  ,   n 3  a ia n , n 3 

= 0.                                           (4.69)

the difficulty with this equation is that knowing a value for  a ia /   does not tell us the value of 
a ia , and vice versa, so that, in general, the above equation imparts no information.  there is one
situation, however, that allows a conclusion to be drawn from (4.69).  although we cant know
both a ia /   and a ia , we do know they have the same sign.  thus, if a ia n  and a ia  have opposite
signs, it follows that

   a ia /  ,   n 3  a ia n , n 3 

= 0 ,       a ia n and a ia   opposite sign  .                         (4.70)

similar conclusions can be reached for states and operators corresponding to s 6  4.  thus, for 
s 6 " 4, we shall express the transforms between position and momentum representations as
follows: 

p ia( " 4 ) , n 3 

=

it is important to note that these transformations hold because of the special coordinate frame
induced by the harmonic-oscillator solutions and the n.b.c.  in this frame, the quark vectors 
y ia  and p ia  are aligned.

v.  composite-particle  scattering  by  quark  exchange

   the nature of the harmonic-oscillator interaction allows the straightforward consideration of
independent subgroups of quarks, or cluster decomposition, in the model of sec. iv.  we shall
consider subgroups which have been kinematically decoupled from the remainder of the system,
by setting for all i and a outside of the subgroup being considered:

a ia

3 
i 

= 3 

b ia

i 

= 0 ,     and    3 

a iab ia

a 

i 

= 0                                             (5.1)

  the first relation comes from the transformation of coordinates (4.22).  the second relation
leaves the hamiltonian (4.35) independent of those coordinates.
   two kinds of scattering problems will be examined, namely lepton-lepton and hadron-hadron
scattering in four-quark clusters.  the results are essentially the same as obtained in the first paper
of ref. 26, so the reader already familiar with the model may want to go directly to sec. vi.

   

a.    lepton-lepton  scattering

   

   the simplest description of particle scattering corresponds to a system of four lepton quarks,
which we shall take to be the following:
    

 + b i a exp  

a 1 s + b 1 

a i a exp  

     

0 s  

 + 

0 s

 i  
 exp  

a 3 

0 s /    

 + a 3 exp  

  i  

0 s /    

 ,    (5.2)

where   i = 1 ,   2 ;   a = 1 , 3 .   from the condition 

n 
3 
i = 1 

y ia

= 0 and (5.1), it follows that,

=  b 2 3.                               (5.3)
   in order to picture the scattering, it is helpful to consider a particular solution.  consider the case
where

=  b 2 1,   b 1 3

=  a 2 1,   a 1 3

=  a 2 3,   b 1 1

a 1 1

a 110

< 0 ,    b 110

< 0 ,    a 230

< 0 ,   b 130

< 0 .                                         (5.4)

the first two of these relations imply that the quark q11 turns around in the observers time, so that
at t =  4, the same quark appears in two different locations in space.32  the other quarks at t =  4
are q23 and q13.
  consider now what quarks exist at  t = + 4.  it follows from (5.3) and (5.4) that

  a 120

> 0 ,     b 120

> 0 ,   a 130

> 0 ,   b 230

> 0 .                                       (5.5)

thus, the quarks q23, q13, and q21 exist in the final state t = + 4, with q21 occurring at two
spatial locations also.
   in order to describe two leptons in the initial state, we apply quark confinement relations as initial
conditions at t =  4:

a 1 1

= a 2 3,          b 1 1

= b 1 3.                                                   (5.6)

   for the observers final state at t = + 4, using (5.3) and (5.6), we find
= b 2 3  with   b 210

= a 1 3 with  a 210

> 0 ,   and b 2 1

= a 130

a 2 1

= b 230

> 0 .                   (5.7)

in other words, the initial state implies that there are four quarks in the final state, also paired into
two leptons.
    from (5.3), (5.6), and (5.7), it follows that

2 
3 
i = 1 

3 
a = 1 , 3 

a iab ia

= 0 .                                                         (5.8)

hence, the hamiltonian (4.35) becomes

h =   / 2   2 a 2 b 2 

+ ( 1 + i  ) 2 

4 
3 
a = 3 

 a a 

 a + a a a a 

  .                             (5.9)

     consider now the leptons formed in the asymptotic regions s 6 " 4 .   with the aid of the quark
solutions (5.2), we obtain

the leptons all have internal states described by the oscillatory solution for w3:

                   =  4 n m

the lepton momenta are obtained from (4.25) and (4.29):

p +

l /  p 1 1

+ p 2 3  s 6 + 4 

  -      2 m  1 / 2 a 1 1exp(

0 s ) .                         (5.12)

from (5.12) and the natural boundary conditions (4.42), we see that the leptons all have the same
mass, or, letting  6 0,

2 =  m / 2 n  ( n 3 

m n 

3 

+ 2 ).                                                   (5.13)

 it is apparent from (5.12) that four-momentum is conserved:

p + 

1 

l + p + 

l + p  

l + p  

l = 0 .                                                 (5.14)

2

since the orbital angular momentum of the leptons is zero, and the internal states are the same, it
follows also that angular momentum is conserved.
   thus, the following picture of lepton-lepton scattering emerges.  in the asymptotic regions of s,
leptons are formed which behave as free particles.  scattering occurs by quark exchange and in the
forward or backward directions only.  since the leptons are identical, one cant discern that any
scattering has taken place.  in other words, the leptons behave as if they are point particles and do
not interact in this strong interaction harmonic-oscillator model.

   following the similar line of investigation carried out for the lepton scattering, we shall suppose
that at t =  4, quark confinement implies

a 1 2

= a 2 4,   and a 120  < 0 ;     b 1 2

= b 1 4  and b 120

< 0 .                               (5.17)

in addition, the quark-antiquark assumption for the initial state implies a 2

   the initial conditions (5.17) dictate the configuration of the scattering.  in the case just
considered, two quarks, q12 and q22, turn around in time.  a different configuration can be chosen
(by different initial conditions), in which quarks q14 and q24 turn around in time.  the two
configurations are similar in nature, but differ in the assignment of quarks in the initial state.  in
addition to these configurations, a third type is possible where none of the four quarks turn around
in time (this third configuration is not an option in lepton-lepton scattering).  all three
configurations can be described by the solutions (5.18) and (5.20) if the appropriate signs are
chosen for  " a 110
   thus, we arrive at the following picture of hadron-hadron scattering.  it is similar to lepton-
lepton scattering in the following ways:  (1)  scattering takes place by quark exchange;  (2)  quark-
antiquark confinement in the initial state (observers time t =  4) implies quark-antiquark
confinement in the final state ( t = + 4 );  (3)  total four-momentum is conserved (a result of the
antiquark assumptions of sec.iv);  (4) the hadrons all have zero orbital angular momentum, and
equal internal angular momentum.  however, there is a crucial difference between lepton and
hadron scattering.  hadron scattering can occur at angles other than 0o and 180o.  shortly we will
calculate the scattering amplitudes, when it will be clear that the constant a2 plays the role of an
impact parameter.
   in summary, the assumption of quark confinement in the initial state for both lepton and hadron 
scattering implies confinement in the final state.  the leptons, however, can scatter in the
forward/backward directions only, tantamount to no scattering at all.  the hadrons, on the other
hand, can scatter in other directions as well.  we shall now formulate scattering amplitudes for
hadron-hadron scattering.

c.  state  vectors  for  hadron  scattering

   a complete set of commuting operators for the four quarks includes (to first order)

 a ia ,   b ia ,   a 2  ,   b 2  ,   n 3 ,   and  n 4 ,   i = 1 ,   2  and a = 2 , 4,                        (5.23)

hamiltonian (4.40).  we shall require that the initial states must also satisfy the following
conditions:

we shall denote the eigenvectors which satisfy  conditions (5.27) as

  / a ia, b ia, a 2 , b 2 , n 3 , n 4 

,     i = 1 ,   2 ,  and a = 2 , 4 .                           (5.29)

the conditions (5.26) and (5.28) will be imposed separately as delta functions.
   note, for the eigenvector above, n3 and n4 can take on negative values.  negative mass-squared
composites are not ruled out.  we ask only that they not be coupled to positive mass-squared
particles.

d.  interpretation  of  the  physical  state  vectors

   the commuting operators (5.23) result in a complete set of simultaneous eigenstates, but the

43

conditions (5.24)-(5.28) reduces the allowed initial states to a subgroup of those states.  in the
usual formulation of scattering problems, one generally employs two complete sets of free-particle
state vectors to represent the incoming and outgoing states of the system.  one goes from the
in basis to the out basis by means of a unitary transformation, or s-matrix.  a particular
transition is characterized by an s-matrix element symbolized, for example, by

 

out

 

in

n  =   

out s   

out

n  .                                                (5.30)

in the present case, however, the s-matrix formulation does not apply.   in the harmonic-oscillator
strong-interaction model, the state vector contains the eigenvalues of all the operators
corresponding t = " 4 in the observers time.  therefore, it is meaningless to speak of the transition
of the state describing the hadrons at t =  4 to a state at t = + 4.  a particular solution must be
characterized by eigenvalues specifying what hadrons exist and what their behavior is at both 
t = " 4.
   at first, this seems to contradict experiment.  for example, repeating a scattering experiment with
identical physical initial conditions yields a distribution of scattering angles.  taking a closer look
at the model reveals there is no contradiction, however.  this is because physical measurements at 
t =  4 do not determine all of the eigenvalues of the operators in (5.23).  further, the addition of
the physical measurements of the final state still does not determine all the eigenvalues.  as we
shall now see, the scattering amplitude reflects this indeterminacy by including a sum over the
unknown parameters.

e.  hadron-hadron  scattering  amplitudes

 the physical initial conditions in the observers time t =  4 consist of the incoming hadron
momenta and masses.  these do not determine which of the four quarks are involved.  thus the
state vector must be expressed as a linear combination of state corresponding to all possible
configurations that might arise.  we shall assume that these states have equal probability of
occurring.
   denote the incoming hadron momenta as p1 and p2.  the three possible quark configurations
will be defined as the s-channel, t-channel, and u-channel configurations.  for the s-channel, put 

 p 1 / p  

1 

 1 / 2 a 2  ;
 1 / 2 a 2  .                                (5.31)
these momenta are taken from (5.20) in the limit s 6  4  and  6 0.  the incoming state vector at 
t =  4 becomes

h =     2 m  1 / 2  b 1 2
h =   2 m  1 / 2   b 1 2

conditions (5.26) and (5.28), appear in the delta function above.
  the conditions (5.24) - (5.26) imply that the final state consists also of two composites, each of
mass m4.  label the composite momenta at t = + 4 as p3 and p4.  then, from (5.20), it follows
that we can put

   in the center-of-energy (ce) system,

s =  e ce  2 ;     t =  2 q 2  1  cos  ;     u =  q 2  1 + cos ,                        (5.39)

where ece is the energy, q is the three-momentum, and   is the scattering angle, all taken in the
ce system. 
   the delta function in (5.37) can be recast in the interesting form
1

z  n + i  
 

 

z  n  i  


.                                 (5.40)


thus, for finite  , the scattering amplitude has simple poles at z = n " i   with constant residues. 

this can be compared to amplitudes for various dual models, such as the veneziano model,24
where the simple poles in s, for example, have residues which are polynomials in t.  in the present
simple version of the harmonic oscillator, the orbital angular momenta of the hadrons are zero.
thus we expect a constant residue.

vi.  quark  electroweak  model

a.  string-like  electroweak  lagrangian

   in sec. i, a general string-like lagrangian was introduced:

a 
a 2 +   q

l =  7   f ( q )  2  q

a f ( q )  2 ? 1 / 2 ,                                      (6.1)
where f(q) depends on the quark coordinates q(s).  we have assumed that at certain energies and
in certain domains of space-time, we can approximate f(q) by  particular functions.  for example,
in a strong-interaction domain, we put f(q)=mhq, with the harmonic-oscillator matrix h given
by (4.8).  in this section, we shall set f(q)=a(q) and consider an expression for a(q) suitable
for the description of electroweak interactions.  in choosing a(q), ones first impulse is to base
the choice on the classical wheeler-feynman model of action-at-a-distance electrodynamics.16,17 

46

however, this does not yield feynman amplitudes in general.
   interestingly, as we shall show, the wheeler-feynman potential can be regarded as a four-
dimensional generalization of a simple one-dimensional problem, namely, the nonrelativistic
collision of two point particles.  this one-dimensional problem can be formulated in other ways. 
we choose one of these alternatives as the basis of the relativistic generalization of the potential.
first-order perturbation theory is then applied to an example of spinless lepton-lepton elastic
scattering.  the unperturbed state is the asymptotic harmonic-oscillator state for two leptons from
different quark clusters. thus, the electroweak interaction between leptons (and between hadrons)
arises because of interactions between the constituent quarks of one lepton with the constituent
quarks of a second lepton. 
   the basis of the wheeler-feynman action-at-a-distance model is the lorentz-invariant action
devised by fokker:17

where

2 ? 1 / 2 ,                                     (6.5)

and a(q) remains to be specified.
   the lagrangian (6.5) yields the primary constraints

 
1 / p 2 + a 2 . 0 ,    and    

2 / a a p . 0.                                     (6.6)

we shall assume  consistency is maintained with a gauge choice (see the discussion of the n.b.c.
and constraints in sections iii and iv)

the hamiltonian displays the familiar minimal interaction substitution p+a for p in a
hamiltonian for a free particle.

b.    the  perturbation  method

   in the schro  dinger picture, assume the state vector obeys equations of motion

h   ( s )  =  i 

m 
m s 

 ( s )  .                                                  (6.12)

if h is constant in s, the equation can be integrated to give

 ( s )  = const. h e ihs   .                                               (6.13)

the solutions in the case of a parametrically invariant action must also satisfy

h   ( s )  . 0.                                                          (6.14)

thus, there is no evolution of the system as a whole in s.  however, we shall again rely on the
parameter   to circumvent this feature and provide a visualization of the process as a function of s.

   assume that h can be expressed as h=h0+hi, where hi is the perturbation term which is very
small and almost vanishes at s = " s, that is, 

 ( " s )  . 0.                                                       (6.15)

h i 

then, (6.14) implies we can take

h o 

 ( " s )  . 0.                                                      (6.16)

   in the interaction picture, a state   ( s )   is defined through the relation

48

providing h0 is nearly constant in s, the state   ( s )   obeys, to first order, the equation of motion
 ( s )  ,                                               (6.18)

the equation of motion (6.18) can be integrated to get

c.    the  unperturbed  states:    asymptotic  harmonic-oscillator  solutions 

   we wish to match the initial state quarks of the unperturbed hamiltonian with asymptotic quark
solutions generated by two different four-quark clusters in the strong-interaction domain.  the
quarks are confined pairwise into composite particles.  recall that quark confinement resulted
from assumed initial conditions, not because of any force  between the quarks.  the asymptotic
solutions of sec. iv describe quarks which are oscillating about a straight-line trajectory in space-
time.  the frequency of oscillation tends to infinity as  6 0 .  in that limit, the quarks become free
strings. 
      let us review the harmonic-oscillator solutions considered in sec. iv and sec.v.  clusters of
four quarks, either all lepton or all hadron quarks, are kinematically decoupled from the
remainder of the system (cluster decomposition).  in each cluster, the four quarks pair up into two
leptons (or two hadrons) in each of the asymptotic regions s 6 " 4.  although s does not
correspond to the observers time, two leptons (hadrons) also exist in of the observers times 
t = " 4.
   the composite particles generated in this way carry no memory of the interactions that

49

produced them, and furthermore two composites coming from different clusters are uncorrelated
except in regard to their internal states and in regard to the observers time.  the internal states are
correlated because the cluster decomposition occurs for a given state of the total harmonic-oscillator
system.  similar to particles associated with a given quantum field, the quarks all share the
corresponding oscillator operators a a  and a a 

 .  as a result, for a given solution, all leptons, and all

hadrons, have the same mass and internal angular momentum.  thus, for the perturbation
calculations, the initial states we shall consider will be two identical leptons or identical two
hadrons.  however, continuing in the spirit of simplification, we shall treat the composites as
identifiable, i.e., we shall neglect statistics.
   the parameter   plays several critical roles in the model of this paper.  we have already seen in

sec. iv how it leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking yielding leptons and hadrons with
different properties.  it was also demonstrated that   is responsible for eliminating any background

frame of reference for the system when it is expressed in terms of the fundamental coordinates
xia (see sec. iv-f).   for the system of coordinates  qia, obtained from the xia by the
transformation (4.5), the lack of background reference frame exhibits itself in a somewhat different
way.  the composite position operators are proportional to 1 /  , but in compensation, the

interaction volume of space-time, defined by the quark position vectors for finite s, shrinks to
zero.  the composites effectively interact by colliding.  however, after the limits are taken, i.e., 
s 6 " 4  and  6 0 ,  the composite momenta become finite and well-defined.  we have implicitly
assumed the observer is somehow outside of the reference frame, but assigns initial and final
momenta to colliding composites.  (recall that for the quark clusters considered, the observer will
always see two composites in both the initial and final states t = " 4.)  in real life, of course, the
composites leave tracks which are measured by some kind of device, such as a liquid in which
bubbles form as the particle passes through.
    returning now to the question of a background reference frame.  we have seen that the
harmonic-oscillator model of secs. iv and v cannot be used to infer the spatial location of the final
state composites in the observers frame of reference.  in other words, we are free to assign initial
spatial position and momentum three-vectors, in the wave packet sense, to two composites
generated by two different clusters.  shortly, we will discuss how this affects the transforms
between position and momentum states appearing in (4.71) and (4.72).   
   with these preparatory remarks, let us now consider the electroweak scattering of two free
leptons.  each lepton in the initial state is composed of two quarks and but generated from different
clusters.  as we noted earlier, the leptons are characterized by the eigenvalues of their momenta

50

and but share the same eigenvalue of n3.  we reset the clock to s=-4 for each particle.  in the
heisenberg picture, the quark momentum vectors for the asymptotic harmonic-oscillator regions 
s 6 " 4 are obtained from (4.25), (4.29) and (4.37), reproduced below:

p ia

= p ia
+ n  1 / 2 7  p ? a ,   a = 1 ,   3 ;                                                   (4.25)
=  m / 2  1 / 2  a iaexp    s    b iaexp     s  ;                             (4.29)

 .      (4.37)

(recall that p1 vanishes. also, note that to define a physical momentum, it is sometimes necessary
to replace pia by  -pia .  see, for example, the conservation of momentum relation (5.14)).
   for the perturbation calculations, we shall work in the schro  dinger picture (s.p.).  let us first
transform the s-dependent h.p. operators to the operators in the s.p.  for a given cluster, this is
accomplished by the transformation

o / exp(  ihs ) o ( s )   exp( ihs ),                                             (6.22)

where h is the redefined hamiltonian of (4.40).  
   thus, in the respective clusters in which they were generated, the quark four-vectors and
momenta become the constant operators

as we noted in sec. iv, these expressions imply that the composite momenta (composites exist
only for s 6 " 4) are aligned with the position four-vectors. however, we wish to consider the
leptons in an observers frame, where we are permitted to choose the position arbitrarily. 
therefore we shall rewrite the operators as

51

in the above, we have assumed the description of the internal state of the lepton is unaffected by
the choice of frame for the composite particle.  we continue to assume that the coordinates qia are
singular;  that is,

q ia % 1 /  .                                                                (6.29)

thus, it is necessary to work in the momentum representation   p ia( s ) ,  n 3 

.  we can define a 

position representation  q ia( s ) ,  n 3 

 only for   finite and when position representations are summed

over as intermediate states in a matrix element.
  the completeness relations and transforms in sec. iv hold in the special frame where the position
and momentum vectors are aligned.  these must then be modified for the reference frame of the
lepton-lepton electroweak interaction.
   since the natural boundary conditions are part of the dynamical system, we assume, as we did in
sec. iv, the completeness relations

   two leptons, generated in two separate clusters, make up the initial state corresponding to the
observers time t =  4.  by resetting the clock in s for each lepton, let this initial state correspond
to s =  4 for each lepton.  similarly, let the observers final state at t = + 4 correspond to  s = + 4.
the positions of the initial leptons are measured in the spatial frame of the observers choice, as
discussed earlier.  as a result, the spatial momentum and position coordinates are no longer co-
linear and we shall assume

    in the strong-interaction model, quark confinement in the initial state t =  4 implied that the
quarks were the confined in the final state as well.  when we calculate the scattering amplitude for
quark qia arising from interactions with the other three quarks, qjb,  we shall see that the resulting
scattering amplitude is the same for both constituents of a lepton, i.e., qi1 and qi3.  moreover,
there is no scattering between constituents of a given lepton.  although this does not provide
rigorous justification for the assumption that the lepton composed of qi1 and qi3 remains intact,
we shall assume in fact that the lepton does so.  in other words, with only intuitive justification,
we shall assume the perturbative forces are not strong enough to disassociate the constituent
quarks.

 is to insert the transform (6.36). 

ij , i.e., we have not chosen a form for the

vector potential a(q).  it is to that choice that we now turn our attention.

e.  a  vector  potential  for  the  nonrelativistic  collision  of  two  point  particles

   electrodynamics is defined through a vector potential a  .  we seek, however, a form of the

vector potential which will include the weak interactions as well.  in short, we seek a form for a  

which will lead to the feynman rules for spinless lepton-lepton electroweak scattering.  although it
is tempting choose the vector potential of the wheeler-feynman model, defined in terms of the
quark coordinates, it is not difficult to demonstrate that this does not lead to feynman rules except
for zero-mass (photon) exchange.
    for an alternative approach, let us re-examine an elementary problem of classical mechanics,
namely the nonrelativistic collision of two point particles in one-dimension.  the problem is first
reduced to the equivalent single particle in a potential which depends on position.  it is customary
to assume the potential is a step function of infinite height.  in this way, regardless of velocity, the
incoming particle hits an impenetrable wall.
   this assumption of an infinite step can be avoided, however, if we assume the potential is
velocity dependent.  consider particles 1 and 2 to have equal mass and let their coordinates be the
functions of time x1(t) and x2(t), respectively.  further, suppose that the initial conditions are 
x 1 (  4 ) =  4 ,   x 2 (  4 ) = + 4 .   designate the initial momenta as p i 
potential

   the vector potential chosen in (6.49) is not unique.  the result (6.55) can also be obtained by
choosing the potential

a ( x ) = 2 p i    (  x 2 ) .                                          (6.56)

56

 we can form a relativistic generalization of (6.56) that yields the wheeler-feynman potential by
defining a four dimensional potential

a   x ( s )  =  c ( p i ) 2  x   ( s 0 ) /   2 x ( s 0 ) a x  ( s 0 )       x 2 ( s )  .                      (6.57)
c is a constant with dimension of length, and s0 is such that x2(s0)=0.  repeating steps similar to
the one-dimensional problem, we find

a   x ( s )  = 2 c 

( p i ) 2

which can be compared to the wheeler-feynman potential (6.3).  however, as we stated earlier,
this potential does not give rise to feynmans rules when applied to the case of non-zero mass
exchange.  so, instead of the analogue of the wheeler-feynman potential, we shall generalize the
quantized version of the simpler expression (6.49).
   the quantized hamiltonian in the center-of-mass system is

h =  1 

2   p 2 + pa + ap + a 2  ,                                                  (6.59)

with

a = 2 p i  ( x ) .                                                                 (6.60)

for constant h, the schro  dinger equation is given by
h   x ( t )  = e   x ( t )  =  1 
2  

this equation can be expressed as

 p i  2   x ( t )                                         (6.61)

m 2  ( x )

m  ( x ) 
m x 

+  p i  2  4  ( x )  1   ( x ) .                (6.62)

   when x<0, this yields the free-particle wave equation

m 2  ( x ) 
m x 2 

=   p i  2  ( x ) .                                                       (6.63)

   when x>0, the equation becomes
m 2  ( x ) 
m x 2 

=  4 ip i  m  ( x ) 
m x 

+ 3  p i  2  ( x ) .                                          (6.64)

   we can assume the wave function  ( x ) is continuous at x=0, but not its derivative with respect

57

to x.  let us integrate the general wave equation (6.62) over an infinitesimal range about x=0.  this
yields

we retrieve the expected result pf=-pi.
   solving the wave equations (6.63) and (6.64) and applying the boundary condition at x=0 leads
to the two independent solutions below:
: 

                                          (6.66)

3  e  i p i x  ,   x < 0 ; 
3  e i 3 p i x  ,            x > 0 .   

   return now to the equation for the discontinuity in  ( x ) given in (6.65).  in terms of bra and ket

notation, it becomes

x = 0 +  p      x = 0   p    =  2 p i

i

0  x n  x n    dx n =  2 p i  0

vii.    internal  spin  variables  and  supersymmetry

   in sec. iii, a lagrangian was introduced which is invariant under the interchange of lepton and
hadron quarks, i.e., under the simultaneous interchange q i 1 : q i 2 ,   q i 3 : q i 4  .  this lagrangian
was later modified in sec. iv by the inclusion of the parameter i  .  in terms of the coordinates xia,
the new system is similarly invariant under the simultaneous transformations x i 1 : x i 2 ,   x i 3 : x i 4 . 
however, the xia were not taken to be the quark coordinates, but were transformed to yield the
defined set of quark coordinates qia.  the lagrangian in terms of the qia is not invariant under the
interchange  q i 1 : q i 2 ,   q i 3 : q i 4 .   nevertheless, the lepton and hadron composites retain the same
mass spectrum.
   the definition of supersymmetry rests on the concept of internal spin, i.e., on systems composed
of fermions and bosons.  although various forms of supersymmetry have been proposed, all are
based on the supposition that the system displays the same mass spectrum for fermions and
bosons.  although the inclusion of spin is beyond the scope of the model presented in this paper,
we shall give a brief and nonrigorous argument of how its inclusion can lead to half-integer spin
for the lepton composites and integer spin for the hadron composites (it should be kept in mind that
the leptons and hadrons of this model consist of pairs of quarks). that is, the leptons are
fermions and the hadrons are bosons, and the system displays a form of supersymmetry.
   the harmonic-oscillator solutions in the asymptotic regions in s produce the composite particles,
the leptons and hadrons.  more specifically, let us consider the case s 6 + 4.  asymptotic quark
momenta are obtained from (4.25), (4.29), and (4.37), and in the limit  s 6 + 4,  6 0, and, in the 
schro  dinger picture, can be taken to be

p ia

=  m / 2  a ia "  1 / 2  n  i  a  

3 

 a 3  ,   a=1, 3  (lepton quarks);                    (7.1)

=  m / 2 

+  1 /  2 n  a 2  " i  1 / 2  n   a  

 a 4  ,  a=2, 4  (hadron quarks).    (7.2)
as we shall see later, it is the extra term a2 in the hadron quark vectors that leads to integral spin
for the hadron composites.  in order to introduce spin variables corresponding to the space-time
variables

a second phase space is added to the phase space of these quark coordinates.  we shall first
consider the oscillator operators a a  and a  
a.  following casalbuoni,33 we add the fermion

creation and annihilation operators a f 

a  and a f 

a 

  to the hamiltonian symmetrically to the product 

a  
a a a.  these fermion operators obey anticommutation relations

a  ? =  g   ,    a = 3 ,   4 .                                                    (7.4)
the eigenstates of the hamiltonian can be taken to be simultaneous eigenstates of the operators n a

a  , a f

7 a f 

and  n a defined below:

n a /   a  
+ a f

a a f

2 =  n a.

note that  n a 
   for the spin variables corresponding to the coordinates a ia and   1 /  2  n  a 2 , we follow
berezin and marinov34 and introduce spin phase space operators  

ia ,

2  ,    

2 5 .  these obey

2 5 

   we now define a lepton quark spin variable  

ia  to correspond to p ia , choosing an expression

analogous to that used by ramond35 to describe hadrons of half-integer spin:

ia =  
 

ia "  1 / 2  n  i  a f

3   a f 

3   ,     a = 1 ,   3 .                                         (7.9)

it follows that

7  

ia ,  

ia ? =  g   .                                                       (7.10)

   suppose now that the klein-gordon constraint (4.10) is replaced by the constraint

 

ia a p ia - 0 ,    as s 6 " 0.                                                         (7.11)

then, the klein-gordon constraint follows, or

p ia

2 - 0 ,    as s 6 0.                                                            (7.12)

     since  

ia a p ia includes terms which change the eigenvalues of n 3  and  n 3 , (7.11) yields a set

of constraints in addition to those implied by (7.12).  using a spinor representation, we can
express these as

  
ia a a ia

 n 3  u ia( a ia)  a ia, n 3 ,  n 3 
= 0 ,            

ia a a 3 

= 0 ,

a f 
3 a a 3  a ia, n 3 ,  n 3 

 a ia a a 3  u ia( a ia)  a ia, n 3 ,  n 3 

.            (7.13)

where uia is a four-component spinor.
   the first of these constraint equations represents a generalized dirac equation and implies that the
corresponding lepton composite has half-integer spin.  the same equation yields the composite
mass spectrum

2 = n 3 .                                                               (7.14)

a ia

there is, of course, a degeneracy in spin.
   in similar fashion, we define a hadron quark spin operator for hadron quarks:

 
ia =  

ia +  

2  " i  1 / 2  n   a f

4 

 a f 

4  .                                      (7.15)

following arguments analogous to the lepton case, we find that the hadron composites are
characterized by integral spin, but have the same mass spectrum.

viii.    summary  and  discussion

63

   although not all of the models predictions were explored here, its simplicity certainly limits
experimental predictions to a qualitative nature. nevertheless, the groundwork has been laid for
future exploration.  for example, just as spontaneous symmetry breaking in the model leads to
different behaviors for leptons and hadrons, the addition of other broken internal symmetries may
yield mass spectra and amplitudes in closer agreement with experiment.  mechanisms are also in
place to examine inelastic scattering, through both more complex quark clusters and the
introduction of perturbative hamiltonians that dont commute with na.   
   the model is characterized by several changes in basic concepts, some of which have been
examined in the past and rejected.  in the present paper, it is the confluence of these changes that
allows a self-consistent and physically realistic model.  taken alone and applied to earlier particle
ontologies, any of these changes, i.e., a relativistic particle ontology, the evolution parameter s,
+ h i  and no background
quark constituents of hadrons and leptons, or the inclusion of    ( h  h 0 
frame), leads to difficulties.  
   of particular interest is the infinitesimal parameter  .  although its role is somewhat obscure and

needs to be better understood, it is deeply connected to the models quantum field-like and string-
like behavior.  in other words, the parameter   suggests that there exists a mathematical structure

which allows fields and strings to be simulated by point particles.  if one accepts this premise, it
becomes clear that leptons as well as hadrons must consist of quarks (as described in this paper),
in order to simulate fields associated with both types of particles.
   regardless of future progress of the model presented, it raises interesting new possibilities.  in
addition to the above, these include the true unification of forces based on lepton and hadron quark
constituents, the extension of a particle ontology to include gravity, and the role of fundamental
harmonic-oscillator quark strings in describing the other forces of electroweak interactions and
gravity.
