abstract: quantum corrections in the hypermultiplet moduli space of type iia string
theories compactied on calabi-yau threefolds are investigated.

talk presented by j. louis at the 32nd symposium ahrenshoop on the theory of

elementary particles, buckow, germany, september 1 - 5, 1998.

string theories with n = 2 supersymmetry in four space-time dimensions (d = 4)
can be constructed either by compactifying the type ii string on a calabiyau threefold
y3 or the heterotic string on k3  t 2. it is believed that the resulting string vacua all
reside in the same moduli space and that any given string vacuum generically has 2 dual
descriptions: either as a type ii vacuum or as a heterotic vacuum [1, 2]. the spectrum
and the low energy eective theory are strongly constrained by n = 2 supersymmetry but
also depend on the specic data of the calabiyau compactication. the massless states
come in n = 2 multiplets which are either vector multiplets v containing a complex scalar,
a vector and two weyl fermions or hypermultiplets h which contain four real scalars and
two weyl fermions. apart from these two standard n = 2 multiplets there also exist
two further multiplets containing an antisymmetric tensor b: the tensor multiplet [3]
containing three real scalars, one b and two weyl fermions as well as the vector tensor
multiplet containing one real scalar, a vector, one b and two weyl fermions [4, 5, 6].
in d = 4 an antisymmetric tensor is dual to a scalar and thus the latter multiplets can be
dualized to a hyper- or vector multiplet, respectively.

in type iia string vacua one has h1,1 vector multiplets, h1,2 hypermultiplets and one
tensor multiplet [7]. the hodge numbers h1,1 and h1,2 count the non-trivial (1, 1) and (1, 2)
forms on y3 while the additional tensor multiplet is universal and contains the type iia
dilaton.1 in heterotic string compactications the situation is slightly more involved. the
dilaton sits in a vector-tensor multiplet, the moduli of the k3 form hypermultiplets while
1 in type iib vacua one nds h1,2 vector multiplets, h1,1 tensor multiplets and one universal multiplet which contains
two antisymmetric tensors. so far there is no o-shell formulation of this multiplet known but it is likely to exist. in any
case one can always dualize one of the antisymmetric tensors and obtain an additional, universal tensor multiplet containing
the type iib dilaton.

the moduli of t 2 come in vector multiplets. in addition there are generically moduli which
arise from the gauge bundle and they can be part of either vector- or hypermultiplets.

n = 2 supergravity severely constrains the interactions among these multiplets. in par-
ticular, the complex scalars of the vector multiplets are coordinates on a special kahler
manifold mv [8] while the real scalars of the hypermultiplets are coordinates on a quater-
nionic manifold mh [9]. locally the two spaces form a direct product [10], i.e.

m = mv  mh .

(1)

in string compactications both components obey a non-renormalization theorem [5,
11]. in heterotic vacua the dilaton is part of a vector-tensor multiplet or its dual vector
multiplet. the fact that the dilaton organizes the string perturbation theory together
with the product structure of the moduli space (1) implies that the moduli space of the
hypermultiplets is determined at the string tree level and receives no further perturbative
or non-perturbative corrections, i.e.

mhet

h = m(0)het

h

.

(2)

in type iia compactications the dilaton resides in a tensor multiplet or its dual hy-
permultiplet and thus the moduli space of the vector multiplets is exact and not corrected
either perturbatively or non-perturbatively

mii

v = m(0)ii

v

.

(3)

the conjectured duality between type iia and heterotic n = 2 string vacua implies
that the low energy eective theories have to be identical when all quantum corrections
are taken into account. in particular their moduli spaces have to coincide, i.e.

mhet

v = mii

v = m(0)ii

v

, mhet

h = mii

h = m(0)het

h

.

(4)

thus, the entire mhet
can be obtained by doing a tree level computation in type iia
v
while the entire mii
h can be obtained by doing a tree level computation in the heterotic
string.

so far the geometry and duality properties of mv have been extensively studied. how-
ever, mh has been much less studied [12] - [18] and in particular the duality conjecture
has only been veried in a very specic (and simple) example [2]. in this talk we study
mh in string perturbation theory of type iia vacua.2 this is a necessary rst step in
order to further establish the type iia  heterotic string duality. apart from this aspect
it is an interesting question in its own right and furthermore might also teach us more
about the n = 1 string perturbation theory.

at the string tree level m(0)ii

is not the most general quaternionic manifold but con-
strained by the c-map [19]. the h1,2 complex scalars of the ns-ns sector by themselves
span a special kahler manifold which is characterized by a holomorphic prepotential [8].
in type iia string vacua they pair up with 2  h1,2 real scalars from the r-r sector to
form hypermultiplets; the combined geometry of these 4  h1,2 scalars is quaternionic.

h

in type iia string perturbation theory we do not apriori know if the c-map is preserved.

however, we do know the following generic facts [15]:

 n = 2 supersymmetry is unbroken in perturbation theory and thus the geometry of

mh must be quaternionic.

2some specic non-perturbative corrections in mh are dicussed in refs. [13, 14, 18].

 the dilaton  resides in a tensor multiplet together with b and two real scalars

0, 0 from the r-r sector;  organizes the string perturbation theory.

 there are h1,2 hypermultiplets containing the scalars (z a, z a, a, a) where a =
1, . . . , h1,2. the complex z a arise in the ns-ns sector and span a special kahler
manifold at tree level. the 0, 0, a, a arise in the r-r sector and thus enjoy a
continuous peccei-quinn (pq) symmetry in perturbation theory

i  i + i ,

i  i + i ,

i, i  r ,

i = 0, . . . , h1,2 .

(5)

 the scalars i, i always appear in pairs in string amplitudes.

 in the large volume limit there is an additional continuous pq symmetry which acts

on z a  z a according to

z a  z a  z a  z a + a,

a  r ,

(6)

and also transforms the i, i in a way specied in ref. [20].

these features strongly constrain the perturbation theory and do lead in fact to a further
(perturbative) non-renormalization theorem.

let us rst study the simple case of a calabiyau compactication with h(1,2) = 0
which implies that only the dilaton multiplet (and h(1,1) vector multiplets) are present.
the tree level lagrangian (in the string frame) for the dilaton multiplet reads [21, 22]
(h)2(cid:19)  c  c  h  (c c  cc) , (7)
e1l(0) = e2 (cid:18)
6e h, c = 0 + i0 and we omitted the
where we dened h = [b], h  = 1
couplings of the vector multiplets. in type iia vacua there is a one-loop correction to the
ricci scalar [23, 16] given by

r + 2 ()2

e1(l(0) + l(1)) =

(e2 + ) r + . . . ,

(8)

where  is up to normalization factors the euler number  of the calabiyau    =
2(h1,1  h1,2). n = 2 supersymmetry uniquely determines the one-loop correction of the
dilaton multiplet to be

e1(l(0) + l(1)) = (e2 + )(cid:18)

this action can be put into a more familiar form by dualizing b to a scalar eld a and
perform a weyl rescaling to the einstein frame. one obtains

e1l =

(10)

where s = e2 + i a + c c. the metric of the scalar elds is a kahler metric with a
kahler potential

k =  ln(s + s + 2   2c c).

for  = 0 one recovers the well known tree level manifold su(2, 1)/u(2) [19, 21]. for
 6= 0 we obtain precisely the metric conjectured by strominger [15]. expanding the
metric of eq. (10) around large s (weak coupling) it appears to have contributions at
all orders in perturbation theory. however, as we just showed this is an artefact of the
dualization and the denition of the s eld. in the eld basis where the antisymmetric
tensor is used (which is the appropriate basis of string perturbation theory) this correction
is manifestly one-loop.3

furthermore, one can show that there is a perturbative non-renormalization theorem
in that the action of eqs. (9), (10) is exact in perturbation theory and does not receive
any perturbative corrections beyond one-loop [26].4 this can be seen from the last term
in (9) which cannot be multiplied by any power of e2 (as would be necessary for higher
loop corrections) without violating the peccei-quinn symmetry of eq. (5).5 alternatively
one can show that the action (10) is the unique action compatible with the quaternionic
geometry and all other perturbative properties enumerated above [26].

let us now come to the general case where in addition to the dilaton multiplet also
h(1,2) hypermultiplets are present. this situation is presently under investigation and we
only indicate our preliminary results here [26]. the known loop corrections are [23, 16]

(12)

where gab is the tree level kahler metric of the z a and v = kaz a ka z a. thus, the
loop correction is universal in that there is a universal correction to gab and the calabi-yau
geometry is not modied. furthermore, the presence of the h  coupling together with the
perturbative pq-symmetries seem to imply a non-renormalization theorem: the geometry
of mh has a universal correction at one-loop but no higher perturbative corrections. more
details will be presented in [26].

3this solves the apparent puzzle in [15] where compactication of r4 terms in m-theory [24, 25] were used to identify
the one-loop correction in the s-basis. the resulting metric was not quaternionic which lead strominger to conjecture his
all-loop formula. however, since n = 2 supersymmetry is unbroken one does expect a quaternionic metric at each loop
order. what we just showed is that stromingers all-loop formula is in fact only one-loop in the appropriate string basis.

4of course, non-perturbative corrections do appear [13, 14, 18].
5 in some sense this is a four-dimensional version of the non-renormalization theorem discussed in [25].
