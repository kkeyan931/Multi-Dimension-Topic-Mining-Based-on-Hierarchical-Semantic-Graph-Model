we investigate domain wall junctions in a generalized wess-zumino model with a zn symmetry.
we present a method to identify the junctions that are potentially bps saturated. we then use a
numerical simulation to show that those junctions indeed saturate the bps bound for n = 4. in
addition, we study the decay of unstable non-bps junctions.

i. introduction.

in eld theories with discrete, degenerate vacua, do-
main walls  eld congurations that interpolate between
dierent vacua  may occur. supersymmetric theories,
for which the vacuum energy is positive semi-denite,
frequently have degenerate vacua.
in many instances,
multiple vacua exist in which the vacuum energy vanishes
and supersymmetry remains unbroken. the degenerate
vacua may or may not be related by a spontaneously
broken discrete symmetry.

general considerations concerning domain walls in su-
persymmetric theories are presented in [13]. a lower
bound on the tension, the bps bound, can be calculated
without explicitly solving for the prole of the wall. do-
main walls break the translation symmetry in one direc-
tion, and supersymmetry is either completely broken, or
1/2 of it is preserved. in the latter case, a central exten-
sion appears in the supersymmetry algebra. the tension
saturates the bps bound and is equal to the (1, 0) central
charge.

in [4,5] it was noted that more complicated eld cong-
urations with axial geometry, domain wall junctions, may
also occur. these congurations, of the hub and spoke
type, are a natural generalization of domain walls, and in-
terpolate between more than two degenerate vacua. far
away from the center of the junction, the elds are ap-
proximately constant  at the vacuum expectation values
of the various vacua  in sectors. these sectors are sep-
arated by spokes, where the eld interpolates between
one vacuum to the next following approximate domain
wall proles. in the center of the junction, the hub, the
domain walls meet and the eld conguration resembles
a string. if these junctions are bps saturated, 1/4 of the
original supersymmetry is preserved and both the (1, 0)

and (1/2, 1/2) central charges appear in the supersym-
metry algebra. the junction tension is determined by a
combination of the (1/2, 1/2) and (1, 0) central charges
[6]. although the two central charges contain (related)
ambiguities, it is shown in [6,7] that the ambiguities can-
cel in physical quantities like the tension.

it is worthwhile to emphasize that domain walls in su-
persymmetric models are not necessarily bps saturated.
for example, in the model of [8] the bps saturation of
a domain wall depends on the values of the model pa-
rameters.
in many models it is not possible to obtain
explicit analytical solutions to the rst order bps equa-
tions.
in those models the question whether solutions
exist at all can still be answered. in [9] a necessary and
sucient condition which indicates whether two vacua
are connected by a pbs saturated domain wall was de-
veloped.

the issue of bps saturation in junctions is more com-
plicated, because a similar condition does not exist. at
this time, there is only one known model [10] in which
a domain wall junction was found as an explicit ana-
lytical solution to the bps equations.
in the absence
of analytical expression for the eld conguration, al-
ternative methods must be employed to study junctions.
some information can be obtained from analytical results
for specic limiting values of parameters or coordinates.
complementary results can be obtained from numerical
simulation of the equations of motion.

for any domain wall junction, a bps bound on the
in [7] the general

junction tension can be calculated.

it is not obvious that this method works also for theories
with more than one chiral supereld.

1

method to obtain this bound from the domain walls sur-
rounding the junction is presented. in this work, it was
also established that the junction tension is negative in
general, although exotic models in which domain wall
junctions have positive tension may exist.

in this paper we will study domain wall junctions in a
class of generalized wess-zumino (wz) models with zn
symmetry. the lagrangian is given by

l = z d2z d2  k(, ) +(cid:26)z d2 w() + h.c.(cid:27) ,

(1.1)

where the kahler potential has the canonical
k(, ) = , and the superpotential is given by

form

w () =  

1

n + 1

n +1.

(1.2)

the action is
transformation
(x, )  e2/n (x, e/n ). moreover, the model has
n physically equivalent vacua given by

invariant under

the

 = e2k/n ,

k = 0, 1, . . . , n  1,

(1.3)

where  is the scalar component of the supereld . de-
spite its apparent simplicity, the model is of physical in-
terest because it is related to the veneziano-yankielowicz
action [11], which is a low energy eective action for su-
persymmetric qcd. the parameter n is related to the
number of colors in the su(n ) gauge group.

for n = 2, the model reduces to the renormalizable
wess-zumino model. it is well known that there is an an-
alytical expression for the domain wall in this case (see
[2], for example).
in the large n limit, an analytical
expression for the basic domain wall  the wall that
connects vacua for consecutive values of k  is presented
in [12,13] to next to leading order in 1/n . in this ref-
erence it is also noted that all vacua in the model are
connected by bps saturated domain walls at nite n .

the basic domain wall junction has also been stud-
ied. we dene the basic junction as the eld congura-
tion that cycles through all n vacua, consecutively from
k = 0 to k = n  1, counter-clockwise around the center
of the junction. in [14] an analytical solution to the bps
equation for the basic junction in the n   limit
was presented. in [7] it was conrmed that the basic
junction is also bps saturated for nite values of n by

 more generally we could consider the superpotential
w() = a  bn+1/(n + 1), but for our purposes this
is equivalent to eq. (1.2) by rescaling the eld and the coor-
dinates as   (a/b)1/n  and x  a(1n)/n b1/n x. in
the literature, the large n limit of the model is studied with
a = n and b = 1/n n 1.

numerical simulations. the tension of the basic junc-
tion was also calculated, analytically to next to leading
order in 1/n , and numerically also for nite values of n .
beside the basic junction, the vacua of the model
allow for a multitude of other types of junctions. as dis-
cussed further in the paper, we devise a general method
to identify all potential bps saturated junction in this
model. there is a very stringent (asymptotic) consis-
tency condition which allows only for a well dened set
of intersection angles between the walls. the set of po-
tential bps junctions we identify contains the junctions
that appear in [15,16], where tilings of domains and net-
works of domain walls in this model are studied.

we consider four types of domain wall junctions in the
model with n = 4, two of which belong to the class
of potential bps saturated, and two more that are not
bps saturated. for each junction we perform a numer-
ical simulaton of the second order equations of motion
to obtain the junction prole. for the potential bps
junctions, we compare the energy of the junction to the
bps bound (which we evaluated from the domain walls
surrounding the junction by the methods in [7]) to de-
termine whether they are indeed bps saturated. for the
other two junctions, we investigate their stability and de-
cay. although we perform our numerical calculations for
the value n = 4, we expect our results to apply to other
values as well. moreover, the methods we use are quite
general, and can be applied to other models.

the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. in
sec. i a, we describe the possible domain walls of the
model. then in sec. i a 1 and i a 2, we describe in detail
the two types of domain walls which exist in the case
n = 4. these walls appear far a away from the center of
the junctions that we consider. in sec. i b we rst discuss
the potential bps junctions in the models for generic n ,
which satisfy a very restrictive consistency condition. we
then focus on the n = 4 case and describe in detail the
two types of bps junctions (sec. i b 1 and i b 2) and the
non-bps types (sec. i b 3) which occur. in sec. i c we
give a brief outline of the computational scheme used for
obtaining the numerical representation of the junctions;
the paper ends with some comments in sec. ii.

a. domain walls.

bps saturated domain walls are solutions to the equa-

tion

x = e(1  n ),

(1.4)

with the boundary condition that  approaches vacuum
values at x   and x  . such solutions exist for
particular values of the phase , which are determined by
the equation

im(cid:8)ew((x  ))(cid:9) = im(cid:8)ew((x  +))(cid:9) .

(1.5)

2

for the model with n = 4, there are two types of
domain walls. the rst type connects adjacent vacua,
for which k diers by one. the second type connects
opposite vacua, for which k diers by two. we will discuss
each of these types in turn.

1. type i domain walls.

although it is not possible to nd an analytical so-
lution for the domain wall prole, the characteristic fea-
tures can be readily uncovered. for deniteness, we focus
on the wall that connects the vacua labeled by k = 0 and
k = 1. from eq. (1.5) it follows that for this wall the
value of  is either /4 or 3/4. for  = /4 (3/4)
the wall connects the vacuum with k = 1 (k = 0) at
x =  to the vacuum with k = 0 (k = 1) at x = .
a general solution to the bps equation contains one
integration constant, indicating the freedom to shift the
center of the wall. we x this constant by choosing the
center of the wall to be at the origin: the wall is then
invariant under the transformation (x) =  (x). to
study the wall close to the center, it is useful to write the
eld in terms of polar variables,  =  e. the symmetry
of the wall dictates that  = /4 and x = 0 at the
center. it then follows from the bps equation that, for
 = /4,

,

(1.6)

x|x=0 = 

1 + 4

where 0 = (0). the value of 0 can be calculated by
evaluating the constant of motion along the wall, i.e.

im(cid:8)ew()(cid:9) at x =  and at x = 0. as a conse-

quence, 0 is the sole real root of the equation

numerically, 0 = 0.55514. the tension of the wall can
be calculated exactly, and depends only on the value of
 at the two ends of the wall; it is given by

2. type ii domain walls.

for deniteness, we focus on the wall connecting the
vacua labeled by k = 2 and k = 0. for this wall, the value
of  is either 0 or . for  = 0 ( = ) the wall connects
the vacuum with k = 2 (k = 0) at x   to the
vacuum with k = 0 (k = 2) at x  . the wall is purely
real. again, we x the integration constant so that the
wall is centered at the origin; with this choice, the wall
is invariant under the transformation (x) = (x).

b. junctions.

bps junctions are solutions to the equation

z =

e
2

(1  n ).

(1.11)

here z = x + y and z = 1/2(x  y). junctions
are static congurations that have the geometry of a hub
and spokes system. in the sectors between the spokes,
the eld  approaches the vacuum values; far away from
the hub,  follows domain wall proles from one sector
to the next on trajectories perpendicular to the spokes.
each spoke is therefore associated with a domain wall.
the hub is the center of the junction where the domain
walls meet.

a few considerations are important to consider what
junctions are possible, and which of those junctions are
bps saturated.

first, the sum of the forces exerted on the junction by
the domain walls that are attached to it has to vanish for
a static conguration.

second, the value of the phase  in the bps equation
for the junction merely determines the orientation of the
junction. the eective value of the phase for the bps
domain wall equation for a wall associated with a spoke
that makes an angle  with the y axis is equal to   .
once the direction of one spoke is xed, for example to
point in the y direction, the value of  is xed. for the
remainder of the spokes, only specic values of  are then
possible. this restriction on the possible values of  turns
out to be a very stringent consistency condition. in the
case of the model with n = 4, inspection of tables i
and ii shows that this condition allows only two types
of junctions as potential bps candidates. we call these
two types a and b respectively, and we investigate them
below.

once it has been established that a static junction ex-
ists, another interesting issue to determine is whether or
not it is stable. if a junction is bps saturated, it is guar-
anteed to be stable (also see the discussion in [7]). for
non-bps junctions, the issue is not so clear; if the bound-
ary conditions also allow a bps saturated conguration,
then the non-bps junction is at most meta-stable.

one can actually devise a general method for generat-
ing all the potential bps saturated junctions in our class
of models. in fact, given the presence of the n degener-
ate vacua (1.3), one has that for n even (odd) there are
n/2 ((n  1)/2) types of domain walls. these dierent
types of walls can be labeled by the integer l = |k1  k2|
or l = n  |k1  k2|, whichever is smaller (here k1 and
k2 indicate the vacua that are connected by the wall);
moreover the tension of a wall, labeled by l, is equal to

n = 4.

.

n = 6.

(1.12)

now, we can represent each type of wall by a vector
with length equal to its tension; thus a junction will be
represented by the vectors of the walls that it contains
far away from the origin, with the direction of the vectors
chosen so that they point in the direction where the cor-
responding wall is located. in a sense, the vectors play
the role of the spokes in the hub and spoke system, but
they have additional information because of their length.
crossing a spoke counter clockwise means that the value
of k increases by l from one domain to the next along
the corresponding domain wall: thus, two junctions will
be equivalent if they can be mapped onto each other by
inversions and rotations.

all of the potential bps saturated junctions can then
be obtained as follows. we start with the basic n -
junction, which consists of n vectors representing walls
with l = 1 (type i walls) at angles of 2/n . then we add
any two neighboring vectors in the diagram representing
the junction, repeating this process until all unequivalent
diagrams have been generated. for n = 4 this procedure
gives the type a and b junctions of above (fig. 1). in
fig. 2 all the potential bps junctions are shown for the
case n = 6.

1. type a junction.

here we study the junction of the type shown in
fig. 1 a). far away from the center of the junction, there
are four sectors in which the eld consecutively takes on
the four possible vacuum expectation values. these sec-
tors are separated by bps domain walls of type i, which
were discussed before.

near the center of the junction, the eld can be ex-
panded in a power series in z and z. accordingly one
has

(z, z) =





xn=0

xm=0

amnznzm,

(1.13)

with amn some complex coecients.

one can in principle allow also for negative n and m with
the condition m > |n| (n > |m|) if n < 0 (m < 0). these
negative values are however excluded when one substitute the
expansion (1.13) in the dierential equation (1.11).

4

the dierential equation (1.11) and the boundary con-
ditions are invariant under the transformations ( =
/2 + /n )

z2 : (z, z)  (e2 z, e2z);
zn : (z, z)  e2(e2z,e2 z).
imposing the zn symmetry the expansion (1.13) takes

(1.14)
(1.15)

the form

(z, z) =



xk=0



xl=0 hbklz1+n k(z z)l + ckl zn (k+1)1(z z)li ,

(1.16)

imposing
with bkl and ckl again complex coecients.
in addition the z2 symmetry, we nd the following con-
straints on these coecients

bkl = (1)n ke2b
kl,
ckl = (1)n (k+1)e2c
kl.

(1.17)

(1.18)

thus, if n is even, one can introduce the real coe-

cients dkl and ekl, obtaining the expansion

(z, z) = e



xk=0



xl=0 hdklz1+n k(z z)l + ekl zn (k+1)1(z z)li .

if on the other hand n is odd, one has

bkl = (1)ke2b
kl,
ckl = (1)(k+1)e2c
kl,

(1.19)

(1.20)

(1.21)

so that, according to the value of the index k, half of the
coecients is real, the other half being purely imaginary.
in the case n = 4 one has  = /4, so that





(z, z) = ei/4

xk=0

xl=0 (cid:2)dklz1+4k(z z)l + ekl z3+4k(z z)l(cid:3) .

(1.22)

we can now calculate the coecients dkl and ekl using
the bps equation; it turns out that all coecients are
determined except for the ones which multiply terms that
contain only z, that is, the ek0. these coecients have to
be adjusted to obtain the correct domain walls far from
the center of the junction.

close to the origin, the conguration looks like a string.
we have proved then that there are sensible solutions to
the bps equations both near the origin and far away from

note that the expansion up to terms of eleventh order in z
and z contains only two adjustable parameters.

it. in order to determine whether those asymptotic solu-
tions can be connected consistently and thus to investi-
gate whether the junction is bps saturated we performed
a numerical simulation of the second order equations of
motions for the eld , while imposing the domain walls
as the boundary conditions at large distance from the ori-
gin. in order to allow the eld to relax to its minimum
energy conguration, we also introduced a damping term
(see sec. i c for details). in fig. 3 we show the modulus
of  after the conguration has come to rest.

in order to determine whether the junction is bps sat-
urated, we will rst calculate the bps bound on the en-
ergy inside a square of radius r, with the center of
the junction located at the center of the square. assum-
ing the junction to be bps saturated the energy inside a
square with radius r can be calculated entirely in terms
of quantities related to the domain walls surrounding the
junction when the radius r is much larger than the size
of the junction. explicitly, for large r, the bound on the
energy takes the form

ebps

l

= t (a)

2 + 4t (i)

1 r.

(1.23)

here l is a distance in the direction perpendicular to
the x-y plane. the second term in (1.23) is the contri-
bution to the energy from the four type i domain walls
connected to the junction; the rst term represents in-
stead the energy of the junction, which is equal to

t (a)

2 = i r1

square

~a  d~l,

where

(1.24)

(1.25)

ai = im(cid:8)xi

(cid:9) .

now, each wall on the contour of the square contributes
the same amount to the tension. the bps bound on the
junction tension is therefore equal to

t (a)

2 = 4z 



a(i)dx,

(1.26)

where a(i) = im(cid:8)(i)x (i)(cid:9) and (i) is the prole of a
type i wall along the x axis. using a numerical repre-
sentation of the type i domain wall, we determined that
t (a)
2 = 2.8614.
we also calculated the energy in a square with radius
r as a function of r directly from our numerical repre-
sentation of the junction using the equation

l

= z r

square(cid:8)x x + y y + v(cid:9) dxdy,

(1.27)

w is the scalar potential. in fig. 4 we

compare this energy with the bps bound. it is clear that
the energy converges to the bound for large r (compared
to the size of the junction) and therefore the junction
does indeed saturate the bps bound.

2. type b junction.

the second type of junction that is potentially bps
saturated has two spokes corresponding to type i walls at
an angle of /2. a third spoke associated with a type ii
domain wall intersects each of the other spokes at an
angle of 3/4. the conguration is sketched in fig. 1 b).
this type of junction may be obtained from a junction
of type a by pinching two neighboring spokes together
in a symmetric fashion, thereby eliminating one domain.
we performed a numerical simulation of the second order
equations of motion, with the appropriate domain wall
proles as boundary conditions, and including a damping
term (see again sec. i c for details). in fig. 5 we show the
modulus of the eld  after the conguration has come
to rest.

to analyze whether this type of junction is bps satu-
rated we follow a procedure similar to the one used for
the type a junction. we rst calculate the bound on the
energy in a square of radius r for large r, assuming the
junction to be bps saturated. this bound takes the form

ebps

l

= t (b)

2 + 2t (i)

1 r + 2t (ii)

1 r  t.

(1.28)

the rst term represents the bps bound on the tension
of the junction. the second and the third term represent
the contribution to the energy from the two type i walls
and the type ii wall (the factor of 2 appears because
the spoke representing the type ii wall is in the diagonal
direction). special care must be taken because the spoke
representing the type ii wall intersects the sides of the
square diagonally, so that the energy contributed by two
triangular areas needs to be subtracted. this is the origin
of the fourth term, t , which takes the form

t = 4z 

0

x(ii)x (ii)xdx,

(1.29)

where (ii) is the prole of a type ii wall along the x
axis.

the eld  on the type ii wall connecting the k = 0
sector to the k = 2 sector of this junction is purely real,
so that it does not contribute to the bps bound on the
tension of the junction. on the other hand the tension
receives equal contributions from each of the type i walls.
the bps bound on the tension of type b junctions is
therefore half of the tension of a type a junction

t (b)
2 =

(1.30)

we can nally evaluate t using the numerical repre-

sentation of the type ii wall, nding in this way

t =

t (a)

.

(1.31)

this is a curious equality, as t is a quantity calculated
from a type ii wall, and t (a)
can be calculated from a

type i wall prole. we have no further comments on the
nature of the equality here, but as a consequence the total
energy in a square with large radius is equal for type a
and type b junctions.

we also calculated the energy in a square with radius
r as a function of r directly from our numerical rep-
resentation of the type b junction using eq. (1.27). in
fig. 6 we compare this energy with the bps bound. it
is clear that for this junction too, the energy in a square
converges to the bound for large r (compared to the size
of the junction). the type b junctions therefore also
saturate the bps bound.

3. non-bps junctions.

here we discuss static junctions that are not bps satu-
rated. for such junctions the values of  associated with
the various spokes are not consistent. however, the to-
tal force on the junction vanishes. moreover, they are
invariant under an extended symmetry group, and there-
fore extremize the energy.

the rst junction of this type that we discuss is dis-
played in fig. 7 a). it consists out of four sectors sepa-
rated by spokes which intersect at /2 angles. however,
in contrast to the bps four-junction, the spokes are as-
sociated with type ii walls.

type does indeed exist. in fig. 8 we show the modulus

stable against local perturbations that break its symme-
try, and it decays into a conguration with three domains
separated by two domain walls, as shown in fig. 9. two
domains with the same vacuum expectation value con-
nect, and the resulting two domain walls are pushed out
of the center.

two walls.

the second type of non-bps walls we discuss is the
eight-junction shown schematically in fig. 7 b). com-
pared to the bps four-junction, this junction has winding
number two. we again found by numerical simulation of
the second order equations of motion that a static con-
guration of this type exists. we show the modulus of
the eld  for this conguration in fig. 10.

guration. at the same time, this damping stabilizes the
forward predicting scheme.

in order to generate unstable junctions, we started our
simulation with an initial conguration that was invari-
ant under the same symmetry transformations as the
boundary condition. as these symmetry are not broken
by the equations of motion, the nal conguration is the
lowest energy conguration consistent with the symme-
tries. such a conguration may be unstable against local
perturbations which break the symmetry.

ii. summary

in this paper we have studied in detail domain wall
junctions in a generalized wess-zumino model. we have
presented a method to identify all potentially bps sat-
urated junctions, and we have described a procedure to
determine whether these junctions indeed satisfy the bps
bound. we showed that in the case n = 4 (the lowest
value of n for which there is more than one potential bps
junctions), these junctions are in fact bps saturated.

on the basis of our results, in conjunction with the
results for the basic junction for generic value of n [7]
and the large n results for the basic junction [6], we
speculate that every potential bps saturated junction for
any n in this model indeed saturates the bps bound.

we also observed that this junction can decay into two
four-junctions with winding number one when a sym-
metry breaking perturbation is introduced. the two re-
sulting junctions repel each other, as shown in fig. 11
we noticed that the eight-junction only decays when the
perturbation is suciently large. for now, we leave open
the question whether this indicates that the junction is
meta-stable, or that this behavior is an artifact of the
nite size of the lattice we used.

c. numerical methods.

we simulated the second order equations of motion
on a lattice using a forward predicting algorithm. the
lattice spacing was chosen to be much smaller than the
size of the junctions, and, at the same time, the size of
the lattice was much larger than the size of the junctions.
for our purposes, a lattice of 251 by 251 points oered
sucient resolution.

we added a damping term to the equations of motion
which allows the eld to relax to a minimum energy con-
