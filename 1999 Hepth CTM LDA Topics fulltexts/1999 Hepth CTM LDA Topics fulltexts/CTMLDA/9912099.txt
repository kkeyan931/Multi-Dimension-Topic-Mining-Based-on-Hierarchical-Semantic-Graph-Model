keep maximum properties symmetries original bethe-salpeter equation 3d equation. properties shall unable satisfy exactly 3d equation, expect inclusion higher-order correction terms progressively improve situation. shall thus try make 3d equation satisfy following list requirements: correct nonrelativistic limit. lorentz invariance cluster separability. always possible render equation lorentz invariant working general rest frame (center mass reference frame) building invariants total 4-momentum vector, although result may unelegant articial. lorentz invariance requirement becomes tool combined cluster separability requirement: mutual interactions switched o, must get set three free dirac equations. total separability easily obtained using hamiltonian sum three free dirac hamiltonians interaction terms. real diculty appears interactions fermion 3 (for example) switched o. want full cluster separability, resulting equation (12) cluster refer global center mass frame anymore, momentum fermion 3 enters denition frame. lorentz invariance cluster separability explicit implicit (via rearrangements). best known example implicit lorentz invariance free dirac equation solved respect energy: becomes explicitly covariant multiplication matrix. implicit lorentz invariances trivial. example, 3d reductions bethe-salpeter equation implicitly covariant, provided series

thus used computation three-fermion bound states. priori, necessarily give also correct scattering amplitudes obey cluster separability, even higher-order terms included. shall nevertheless try get 3d

remaining dependence (in free propagators) approximated bethe- salpeter equation relative energies eliminated performing closed path integrals. derivation 3d equation approximated bethe-salpeter
