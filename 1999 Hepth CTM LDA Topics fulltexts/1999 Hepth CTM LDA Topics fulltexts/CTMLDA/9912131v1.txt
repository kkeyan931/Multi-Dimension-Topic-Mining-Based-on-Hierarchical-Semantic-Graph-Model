abstract

the freedom in choosing nite renormalizations in quantum eld theories (qft) is character-
ized by a set of parameters {ci}, i = 1 . . . , n . . ., which specify the renormalization prescriptions
used for the calculation of physical quantities. for the sake of simplicity, the case of a single
c is selected and chosen mass-independent if masslessness is not realized, this with the aim of
expressing the eect of an innitesimal change in c on the computed observables. this change
is found to be expressible in terms of an equation involving a vector eld v on the actions
space m (coordinates x). this equation is often referred to as evolution equation in physics.
this vector eld generates a one-parameter (here c) group of dieomorphisms on m. its ow
c(x) can indeed be shown to satisfy the functional equation

c+t(x) = c(t(x))  c  t

0(x) = x,

so that the very appearance of v in the evolution equation implies at once the gell-mann-low
functional equation. the latter appears therefore as a trivial consequence of the existence of a
vector eld on the actions space of renormalized qft.

to the memory of g. de rham,
my teacher in mathematics.

the so-called renormalization group (rg) in physical science was, from its early begin-
nings [1], the theory that describes the geometry of action space. in this space the covariance
of physical quantities turns out to be manifest.

this paper is intended to be an overview of the rg as it is used by physicists, especially
in quantum field theory (qft). however, the emphasis will be put on the geometry (as said
before) of the space of actions, with a view, among other things, on how a functional equation,
derived in [2], becomes a simple and trivial consequence of the geometrical set-up developed
below by means of qft manipulations.

of paramount importance has been the discovery [1] that renormalized physical quantities
satisfy equations in which the basic geometrical object is a vector eld dened in the action
space m. let v be this vector eld. then the theory of dierentiable manifolds [3] implies, due
to the very existence of a vector eld, a set of theorems, lemmas and corollaries which exhausts
all that can be said about the renormalization group in physical applications. in general, one
deals with a set of parameters {ci} but, in the following, we shall restrict this set to a single
parameter, denoted t for practical reasons. this restriction is mainly dictated by the fact that
one wants to be able to make direct comparisons with ref. [2] which uses a single parameter in
its xing of renormalization prescriptions. thus, in the single parameter case, we have amongst
others the following theorems.

theorem i.

a smooth vector eld v on a compact manifold m generates a one-parameter group of
dieomorphisms of m.

theorem ii.

suppose v is a c r vector eld on the manifold m, then for every x  m, there exists an
integral curve of v , t  (t, x) such that

1. (t, x) is dened for t belonging to an interval i(x)cr, containing t = 0 and is of

class c r+1 there.

2. (0, x) = x for every x  m

3. given x  m, there is no c 1 integral curve of v dened on an interval properly

containing i(x), and passing through x (i.e. such that (0, x) = x).

from the uniqueness property 3, follows at once

theorem iii.

if s, t and s + t  i(x), then we have the functional equation

(s + t, x) = (t, (s, x)) .

(1)

flow: the set of pairs (x, t), x  m, t  i(x) is an open subset of m  r containing x,

hence a smooth manifold p, of dimension n + 1. the mapping : pv  x by (x, t)  (t, x)

is called the ow of the c 1 vector eld v . if m and v are c , the ow is also of class c .
writing (t, )  t : x  (t, x); (eq. 1) can be written

s+t = t  s

; 0 = e .

(2)

the set of mappings {t} is the one-parameter group mentioned by theorem i, provided, as is
the case for our concern, i = r. (it is obvious that each element t has an inverse t so that
t  t = e)1.

according to the few theorems given up to now, one sees that the vector eld v is the key
concept, generating a ow (t, x)  t(x) in m. since the t, with xed t, is a dieomorphism
m  m, it represents the one-parameter abelian group according to (eq. 2). therefore, v
can be seen as the innitesimal generator of the ow group t. indeed, for t innitesimal, say
0 + t, we have the innitesimal ow

0+t(x) = 0(x) + tv (x) + o(t2)

(with 0(x) = x), by taylor expending (t, x) around t = 0, so that

(0 + t, x)  (0, x)

= v (x) .

or, taking the limit t  0

t

d(t, x)

dt

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

= v (x) .

(3)

v (x) is therefore, as we said at length before, the innitesimal generator of the ow group.
then, by exponentiation, one gets

(t, x) = exp[tv ]  x

which fulls, as expected

a) (0, x) = x

b) d

dt (t, x) = v exp[tv ]  x = v ((t, x))

c) (s + t, x) = (t, (s, x))

(remember the operator nature of v , which can be abbreviated v = v  

x .)

the elementary considerations made up to now, would be sucient for the current appli-
cations of the rg to qft since, as is well-known, the one-parameter t is the logarithm of a

the appearance of the arbitrary dimensional parameter 2 cannot be avoided and is the
source of the breakdown of conformal and scale invariances in classical conformal invariant
lagrangians. the deep source of this anomalous breakdown is traced back, as is well-known,
in the procedure of the second quantization [4]. in this reference, r. jackiw notices  . . . we
may say that our present point of view towards scale and conformal symmetry breaking was
pregured by bohrs intuition concerning eects of quantization on space-time symmetries.

in conclusion, in order to x the ideas in the present physical notations, v is expressed

as

v = a(g) 


ga

; a = 1 . . .  ,

if there are  couplings in the considered theory. g  {ga} is the set of couplings and {a(g)}
that of the components of the vector eld.

we see therefore that the a are the components v  of v and the ga, the coordinates x
of m (called in physics the action space). finally, the components of the ow in this space are
denoted ga(t, g), corresponding to the (t, x) components of the ow (t, x) on m.

so that, since, as we have seen, v is the innitesimal generator of the one-parameter ow
ga is the one-parameter ow group innitesimal generator on action space. as
ga (see the example in the

group on m, a 
a ow, g(t, g) can be obtained from the exponentiation of v = a 
appendix a). it therefore satises the functional equation (1) as expected, namely:

with g(0, g) = g as boundary condition.3

g(t + s, g) = g(t, g(s, g))

the fundamental equation for qed s-matrix elements, already quoted in its simplest for-
mulation in the abstract of ref. [1], and which has been mentioned in this paper as the equation
introducing in physics a vector eld v was

3in ref. [2], g(t, g) is expressed as e2d(t, e2), with t = log(2/2)  log x2 in their notations. e2 stands
for g up to a change of coordinate since the qed case is investigated, with one single parameter , as in the
formulation of the present paper.

notice that the index i has been dropped in the formulation of this paper, since it stands

for the numbering of the various arbitrary normalization conditions.

to our knowledge, the rst author who took into consideration the general case [1] with
several parameters ci is crewther [5]. his analysis is conned to a nite set of normalization
conditions r(ci), and he put forward the very simple argument that it is sucient to consider
transformations in the ci-space possessing the group property, which warrant a satisfactory rule
for this special subset r(ci) of normalization conditions to have the group property. this is
what was called normalization group in ref. [1]. so the group property is a feature of many
subsets of the whole set of prescriptions, g, but certainly g itself (the countable innite set of
prescriptions) does not, strictly speaking, possess this property.

a very popular set of prescriptions are the so-called mass independent schemes, for which
the normalization factors are computed with the bare mass set equal to zero. then the renor-
malized mass is treated like a renormalized coupling [6]. in accordance with nave dimensional
analysis, the vector eld components can only depend on the couplings [7].
in this set one
nds, among others, dimensional regularization supplemented by minimal subtraction (ms) or
its cousin ms. this mass-independent set of prescriptions possesses the group property. several
authors [8] tried to tackle the case when the ci are innite in number, especially with the aim
of optimizing the perturbation series truncated at a given order. although the possible group
property in these extreme cases has not been addressed, these authors established that the
most general coupling constant g(c1, c2, . . . c) depends, as we wrote, on the countable innity
of ci and were able to show in a particular case that the ci are linear in the bi, the numerical
i=n bigi, n = 1, 2 . . ..
these coecients are well-known for their dependence on the prescription used. in other words,
geometrically, they depend on the choice of the coordinate {ga} in action space. however, the
choice of a system of reference is arbitrary and the above results do not shed light on which
sets, if any, enjoy the group property in a banach space.

coecients in the expansion in g of the vector eld component (g) = p

in conclusion, the passage from a single parameter c0  t considered in this paper, to several
ci, or an innity of them, is not straightforward. again we might be able to consider, as was
done in [1], sets of transformations in the ci space which possess the group property. this
problem involves the theory of several parameter lie groups of transformations and lies beyond
the modest scope of this paper. nevertheless, a few guidelines will be given in appendix b in
a very concise and not mathematically rigorous way.

appendix a

as a very simple example, we take, for the vector eld v  (g) 
action space (coordinate g), the rst term of (g) in a g expansion, say

g in a one-dimensional

the exponential exp{tv }  x is dened by its taylor expansion

(g) = bg2 .

a well-known result.

g(t, g) = exp{tv }g =

as an exercise, the reader can establish, according to the above, the approximate bogoljubov-

shirkov relation in the next order for g(t, g) [9]

g(t, g) = g[1  b1gt +

b2
b1

g log(1  b1gt)]1

by taking

(g) = b1g2 + b2g3 .

a second exercise is to show that

exp{tv }gn = gn(t, g) =

gn

(1  gbt)n

when the vector eld v = (g) 
i.e. (g) = bg2, like in the rst example.

g is approximated by the rst term in the g expansion of (g)

since s-matrix elements can be expanded in powers of g

s(pi, g) =

an(pi)gn



xn=0

it follows that

exp{tv }  s(. . . g) = s(. . . g)

(pi and the dots stand for arguments other than g and independent of it. the case when other
couplings, like gi and masses mi occur, goes outside the one-dimensional action space and v
becomes v = v  
x , the x being the coordinates in the enlarged action space, namely the gi
and mi above.)

appendix b

the passage from a one-parameter case to the case with several parameters ci is far from trivial,
although treated at length in the textbook references, especially [t.1][t.4]. sketching what
happens, from an element g depending on one parameter g(t) g(s) = g(s+t) with g(t) = 1+tv
for t innitesimal one goes to

with all ti innitesimal. (i generators v i)

g(t1, . . . ti) = 1 + t1v 1 + t2v 2 + . . . tiv i

the combination of two such elements g(t1, . . . t1)  g(s1, . . . si) is given by the well-known

baker-campbell-hausdorf formula.

for the product to be also an element of the set, the condition [v i, v j] = c

ijv  is necessary
and sucient. it was a condition explicitly formulated in [1] for a set of normalization conditions
to form a group. for our concern, the g(t) are connected with the ow t(). therefore the
group property concerns the ows, as in the one-parameter case discussed in this paper.

the non-trivial aspect now is that we must distinguish between the left combination of g(ti)
with g(si) from the right combination. all this is treated in the mentioned textbooks and goes
beyond the scope of the present modest account of vector elds.
