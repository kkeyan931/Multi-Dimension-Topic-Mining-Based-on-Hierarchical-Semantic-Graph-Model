the truncation in the number of single-trace chiral primary operators of n = 4 sym

and its conjectured connection with gravity on quantum spacetimes are elaborated. the
model of quantum spacetime we use is ads5

q for q a root of unity. the quantum sphere
is dened as a homogeneous space with manifest suq(3) symmetry, but as anticipated from

q s5

the eld theory correspondence, we show that there is a hidden soq(6) symmetry in the

constrution. we also study some properties of quantum space quotients as candidate

models for the quantum spacetime relevant for some zn quiver quotients of the n = 4
theory which break susy to n = 2. we nd various qualitative agreements between the

proposed models and the properties of the corresponding nite n gauge theories.

introduction and summary

the maldacena duality [1,2,3,4] gives a relation between type iib string theory on
ads5  s5 and the n = 4 superconformal four dimensional super yang-mills. the gauge
group of the eld theory is su (n ) when the ux through s5 is n . in the case of large n

and large eective coupling, maldacenas conjecture relates the corresponding eld theory

and the classical supergravity. finite n eects contain important information about the

qualitative novelties of quantum gravity compared to classical gravity.

it was proposed in [5] that the quantum corrections in the ads  s background have

the eect of deforming spacetime to a non-commutative manifold. the concrete model
studied there was ads3  s3 where the group structure of the manifold allowed a simple
non-commutative candidate by using quantum groups. an important part of the evidence

was a quantum group interpretation of the cuto on single particle chiral primaries, rst

studied under the heading of stringy exclusion principle in [6].

here we develop the same line of argument to understand analogous cutos in the

spectrum of chiral primaries of n = 4 super yang-mills. the cutos originate from
the fact that the u (n ) invariants of the form trl, where  is a matrix in the adjoint

representation, are not independent for all values of l and the set of independent invariants

truncates at n . since the yang-mills theory has an so(6) global symmetry, we get an

so(6) covariant cuto on the chiral primaries. in the large n limit, the chiral primaries
are matched on the gravitational side with modes coming form kk reduction on s5. to
understand the cuto at nite n , we postulate that the s5 is deformed to a quantum
sphere in the following way: s5 has a description as a coset space su (3)/su (2) which

generalizes to the q-deformed case as suq(3)/suq(2). this construction is shown to have

soq(6) hidden symmetry by mapping it to another construction of a q-sphere based on

[7], thus explaining why kk reduction on it gives a truncated set of reps. of so(6).

we then discuss n = 2 theories obtained by taking zn quotients of u (n n) theories
with n = 4 supersymmetry, which are dual to gravity on ads5  s5/zn. we discuss the
cutos in the spectrum of chiral primaries in the quotient theories. the main point is

that, if we ignore states coming from twisted sectors associated with non-trivial reps. of

zn, the cutos occur at n n as in the parent theory. to nd candidates for the quantum

space dual of the quiver theory we identify appropriate automorphisms of the dual theory,
which are used to quotient the quantum s5

q to give a space with suq(2)  uq(1) symmetry.
when twisted sectors are taken into account, the cuto in some chiral primaries charged

1

under the u (1) happens not at n n but at n . we begin a discussion of the quantum space
q as an s1
explanation of this change of cutos. this requires the description of the s5

bration over a q-deformed ball, which is acted upon by the quotient.

2. truncation of generating chiral primary operators in n = 4 super yang-mills

consider the chiral primaries of this theory which are of the form :

ca1a2al tr(a1    al )

(2.1)

where the c are traceless symmetric tensors of so(6). these symmetric tensors can be

decomposed under su (3) and contain the symmetric rep. of su (3) corresponding to a

young tableau with one row of length l. the polynomials corresponding to this young
tableau are ci1i2il tr(i1i2    il ), where the c are symmetric, and the ik are indices
running from 1 to 3 and the corresponding scalars are complex.

it is useful in the discussion of cutos to decompose the invariant polynomials in reps.

of su (3). in order to obtain the decomposition of symmetric representations of so(6)

into representations of su (3), we can use the isomorphism between so(6) and su (4)

under which the vector representation of so(6) goes into the antisymmetric representation

of su (4), and each symmetric traceless representation of so(6) goes into the (0, k, 0)

representation of su (4). the branching rules for the (0, k, 0) representations of su (4)

into representations of su (3) are, for example,

for k = 1

6  3  3,

for k = 2

20  6  6  8,

for k = 3

50  10 + 10 + 15 + 15.

(2.2)

so the vector representation of so(6) gives a fundamental and an anti-fundamental repre-
sentation corresponding to tr(i) and tr(i) (i=1,2,3), which include the chiral primary

operator of dimension 1. the symmetric traceless representation 20 gives the follow-
ing operators : tr((i1 i2)) (the 6 representation), tr((i1i2)) (the 6 representation),
tr((i1 i2)) (the 8 representation). these include the chiral primary operator of dimen-
tr((i1 i2 i3)) (the 10

sion 2. the representation 50 of so(6) gives the following :

representation), its conjugate one (involving the complex conjugate elds and correspond-
ing to the 10 representation), tr((i1 i2 i3)) (the 15 representation) and its complex

2

conjugate (the 15 representation). these contain the chiral primary of dimension 3. we

can continue the discussion to show that each symmetric traceless rep. of so(6) contains

a chiral primary belonging to a rep. of su (3) associated to a symmetric young tableau.

the chiral primary operators are not all independent at nite n . consider rst

the operators which look like tr(n+1) when the gauge group is u (n ).
if the genera-
tors of the lie algebra are t a, the chiral primary operator is written as tr(at a)n+1 =
a1    an +1 tr(t a1    t an +1 ). but tr(t a1    t an +1 ) is just the cn+1 casimir operator
of u (n ) and we know that u (n ) has only n independent casimir operators so cn+1 is
not independent and can be written in terms of lower casimir operators. therefore, the
conclusion is that tr(n+1) can be written in terms of tr(n ), tr(n 1) and so on. thus
tr(n+1) does not describe a single particle state. the conclusion is that for the group

u (n ) we have a truncation on the chiral primary operators such that the highest power is

n. for instance,  can be one of the three is. the rest of the symmetric polynomials like
tr(i
3) can also be decomposed since they can be obtained from the chiral primary
by action of so(6). in fact for any given dimension, there is only one short representation,

1j

2k

so that operators of the form

tr(f    )

(2.3)

can also be shown to be decomposable as they are obtained from the chiral primary by

action of the susy operators.

the result is that we have a truncation on the short representations for the gauge

group u (n ), the maximal symmetric traceless representation of so(6) being the one

with n boxes in the young tableau. this will allow us to identify a candidate quantum

sphere relevant for the spacetime understanding of nite n eects. after describing some

preliminaries on quantum groups we will describe the relevant quantum space in section

3.3

3. non-commutative spacetime

natural non-commutative candidates for ads5  s5 are obtained by deforming the
coset struture of the spaces involved using quantum groups. we will be concerned with
some detailed properties of the q-deformed s5 in this paper, which are relevant for the

truncation in kk modes. the unit ve sphere is the space p6

i = 1 where xi are
coordinates in r6. so(6) acts transitively on the solutions of this equation. a point, say

i=1 x2

(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) is left xed by so(5). this allows an identication of the sphere with the

3

coset so(6)/so(5). it is posible to consider r6 as a complex space c3 with coordinates
j=0 |zj|2 = 1
in c3. in this case the sphere is seen as a coset su (3)/su (2). the latter coset space

z0 = x1 + ix2, z1 = x3 + ix4, z2 = x5 + ix6 and the sphere becomes a surface p2

struture allows a simple quantum group generalization.

3.1. preliminaries of quantum groups

the standard q-deformation of quantum groups is given in [7] . for a matrix t i

j of a

quantum group, the commutation relations among the matrix elements are given by

r12t1t2 = t1t2 r12.

this is a shorthand of the following

rij

klt k

mt l

n = t i

kt j

l rkl

mn.

(3.1)

(3.2)

the matrix elements t i
j in the fundamental rep. generate the algebra of functions on the
quantum group. the matrix t has an inverse t 1 given by the antipode. the antipode
is an automorphism s of this algebra such that s(t i

j) = (t 1)i
j.

for slq(n ; c), the r matrix is given by

rij

kl = i

l j

k(1 + (q  1)ij) + i

kj

l (j  i),

(3.3)

where (j  i) = 1 if j > i and (j  i) = 0 otherwise. in [7] a -anti-involution is given

for slq(n ; c). with respect to this -anti-involution, a real form of slq(n ; c) can be
dened by (t i
i . for q being a phase, the real form slq(n ) can be dened
by t  = t ; and for q being real, the real form suq(n ) can be dened.
(we require
that the  of a complex number be its complex conjugation, so e.g. q = q1 if q is a

j) = (t 1)j

phase.) in this paper what we need is suq(n ), but there is no -anti-involution for this

purpose when q is a phase. it turns out that the appropriate -structure is an involution

instead of anti-involution. (an involution does not reverse the ordering of a product and

an anti-involution does.) let

gi

j = qii
j,

where i, j = 0, 1,    , n  1, then we dene

t  = g1t 1g,

4

(3.4)

(3.5)

where t  is the transpose of t . one can check that this denition gives a -involution.
first, because s(s(t )) = g2t g2, (t ) = t . secondly, (3.1) is invariant under the action

of . to check this, one can use the following identities

rij

kl = rkl
ij ,

r(q1)12 = r(q)1
21 ,

g1
1 g1

2

r12g1g2 = r12.

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

3.2. the quantum sphere

to begin we dene the quantum complex plane cn

suq(n ) acting on it. the algebra of functions on cn
i = 0, 1,    , n  1, which satisfy the following commutation relations

q which has the symmetry group
q is generated by the coordinates zi,

more explicitly, it is

z1z2 = q1z1z2 r12.

zizj = q1zkzl rkl
ij .

the coordinates z transform under an suq(n ) matrix t as

z  zt.

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

we let all zks to commute with all t i
by this transformation. (note that t i
conjugation of z is dened as a -involution. let zi = z

js. due to (3.1) , the relations (3.9) is preserved

j commutes with zk for all i, j, k.) the complex

i . the  of (3.9) is

z1 z2 = q1 r21 z1 z2,

(3.12)

which is covariant under the transformation z  t  z, as the  of (3.11) . to complete the
denition of the algebra on cn

q , we also need to dene how z commutes with z. let

which means

z1z1 = q1z2g2 r12g1

1 z2,

zizk = q1+jkzj rij

kl zl.

5

(3.13)

(3.14)

it is covariant under the action of suq(n ).

the coecient of q1 on the right hand side of (3.13) is chosen such that the radius

squared

r2 = zg z

(3.15)

is a central element in the algebra. one can also check that r2 is real: (r2) = r2. since r2

commutes with everything else, we can dene a new algebra by the algebra of z, z, modulo
the condition r2 = 1. this is the algebra of functions on the quantum sphere s2n 1
can be identied with the quantum sphere dened as suq(n )/suq(n  1) [8] . explicitly,

. it

q

the commutation relations of z, z are

zizj = qzj zi,

i < j,

zi zj = qzj zi,

i 6= j,

zi zj = q1 zj zi,

i < j,

zi zi = zizi  q1xj>i

qjizj zj .

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

another natural candidate for the q-deformed sphere is the soq(n )-covariant quan-
tum euclidean space rn
q modulo the unit radius condition. the quantum group
soq(n ; c) is dened by (3.1) with a dierent r matrix, which also has the properties
(3.6) and (3.7). in addition, one has

c1c2 r12c1c2 = r21,

(3.20)

where c i

j = i

n+1j .

for q being a phase, the real form soq(n, n) or soq(n, n + 1) can be dened by
t  = t for a -anti-involution. for real q, the real form soq(n ; r) exists with respect
to the -anti-involution t  = gt g1, where gi
n+1j . we need soq(n ; r) for q
being a phase, so again we can only dene it with respect to a -involution. we nd the

j = qii

appropriate -involution to be given by

t  = ct c.

(3.21)

incidentally, if one wants to dene soq(2n, 2m), we can generalize the above to t  =
ct c 1, where c i
n+1j (n = 2(n + m)) with m of the s equal to 1 and the
rest to 1. this includes so(4, 2) which is of interest in dening the deformation of the

j = ii

6

ads part. the -involution in the corresponding universal enveloping algebra is recently

given in [9], where some useful information about unitary representations when q is a root

of unity is also given. in the following we will concentrate on soq(n ; r), which will be

denoted as simply soq(n ).

the soq(n )-covariant algebra of functions on the quantum euclidean space is dened

by [7]

x1x2 = q1x1x2 r12 + r2g,

(3.22)

where  = (1  q2)/(1 + qn 2) and r2 = xtgx is the radius squared. the transformation
of soq(n ) on x is x  xt . the -involution compatible with (3.21) is

x = xc.

(3.23)

since we have demanded all algebras to have the -involution, it follows that there is
a symmetry of q  q1 if we simultaneously take x  x, t  t  etc. it is therefore
equivalent to say that we have s5

q or s5

q1.

it can be explicitly checked that the algebra of c3

q/(r2 = q2 + q2). in the rst two models of s5

q is the same as the algebra of r6
q
via the identication zi = xi+1 and zi = x6i for i = 0, 1, 2, and then r2 = (q2 + q2)r2.
q/(r2 =
therefore the three denitions of s5
1) = r6
q , the action of suq(3) is manifest.
in the third model the action of soq(6) is manifest. this suggests that suq(3) can be
realized as a subgroup of soq(6). this is indeed the case. given a 3  3 suq(3) matrix t,
we can dene a special 6 6 soq(6) matrix t by tij = tij for i, j = 1, 2, 3, tij = t
for i, j = 4, 5, 6, and all other elements tij = 0.

q are actually equivalent: suq(3)/suq(2) = c3

(7i)(7j)

3.3. quantum sphere for u (n ) n = 4 sym

now that we have established the soq(6) symmetry of the quantum sphere, we use

the fact that kk reduction on this space will give a family of reps. of soq(6). in sec. 3.5

we will show that soq(6) can be identied with suq(4). for q being a root of unity, the

reps. of suq(4) contain indecomposable reps. which form an ideal under tensor products.

after quotienting these out, one is left with a set of standard reps. with a truncation.

the length of the rst row of the young tableau cannot exceed k for q = e

i

k+4 . this fact

is familiar from 2d wzw models [10,11] and has been studied in detail for uqsu (2) in
[12][13]. this allows us to identify k  n to get a quantum sphere which gives a kaluza-

klein reduction which agrees with the spectrum of chiral primaries discussed in section

2.

7

3.4. zn automorphisms and symetries of quantum quotient spaces

we now discuss some sub-algebras relevant for the quantum space analog of the n = 2

quotient theories which will be discussed in the next section. the quantum group suq(3)
has suq(2) as a subgroup. given a 2  2 suq(2) matrix t, we can dene a 3  3 suq(3)

matrix t by tij = tij for i, j = 1, 2, t33 = 1 and all other elements tij = 0. the group
zn mentioned in previous sections can then be embedded in suq(2) as a diagonal matrix
diag(, 1), where n = 1.

classically, so(6) has a maximal subgroup su (2)  su (2)  u (1). this is also

true for soq(6). the presence of a uq(su (2))  uq(su (2))  uq(u (1)) subalgebra in

uq(so(6)) or uq(su (4)) is clear from the denition of these algebras using the q-analog

of the chevalley-serre basis [14]. from the point of view of the algbera of functions on

soq(6) we can describe a suq(2)  suq(2)  uq(1) as follows. the rst suq(2) is

the second suq(2) is

the uq(1) is

(3.25)

(3.26)

these 6  6 matrices corresponding to the three subgroups suq(2), uq(1) and suq(2)

commute with one another, and they all satisfy the relation (3.1) for soq(6). note that in

checking whether these matrices commute with one another, we should take any entry in

a matrix to commute with any entry in another matrix. the reason for this is that if we
take two matrices t and t  from a quantum group, for their product to satify the same

8

rtt relation (3.1) we should let all entries in t to commute with all entries in t . (the

functions on two copies of the group manifold is given in a tensor product.)

the zn symmetry we quotient by is a subalgebra of uq(1) which is embedded as
tij = t(i+4)(j+4) = diag(, 1) for i, j = 1, 2, t33 = t44 = 1, and all other elements
vanishing, for || = 1.

the commutant of the zn action is suq(2)  uq(1), with the same q as before. this
fact will be useful in a quantum space-time understanding of the relation between cutos

on chiral primaries in an n = 4 u (n n) theory and its zn quotient.

3.5. suq(4) symmetry

since the universal enveloping algebra uq(g) for a classical group g is completely

determined by the cartan matrix of g, and since the cartan matrix of su (4) is the same

as that for so(6), soq(6) is identical to suq(4) ( up to global dierences which do not

aect the general sub-group structure). therefore soq(6) has a subgroup suq(3) which

is manifest in the suq(4) description.

while we arrived at the suq(4)  soq(6) symmetry by explicitly mapping to an
algebra which had the larger symmetry, we can also guess it by an indirect argument. a

hint for the hidden su (4)q comes from a consideration of kk reduction on suq(3)/suq(2).

suppose we are dimensionally reducing a scalar on the coset su (3)/su (2). we have to

look for all reps. of su (3) which contain a scalar of su (2) [15]. we know that the reps.

of su (3) we have are precisely such that they combine into reps. of su (4). to kk reduce

on suq(3)/suq(2), we q-deform the rule above and look for reps. of suq(3) which contain

the scalar of suq(2). it is very plausible that the reps. still combine into reps. of suq(4)

since the structure of the reps. at roots of unity remains the same as long as we stay

within the cuto. this can be proved by using the generalization of the gelfand-zetlin

bases ( described for example in [16]), which exists because of some special properties of

the branching rules in the sequence of subgroups su (2)  su (3)  su (4). the gelfand-

zetlin bases have been generalized to roots of unity ( discussed for example in [17] ) so this

should provide the proof that the desired q-generalization of the branching rules is correct.

the matching between suq(4) and soq(6) can also be illustrated as follows. there

is an suq(3) subgroup of suq(4) which acts on (z1, z2, z3). let us represent it as

this corresponds to the suq(3) embedded in soq(6) which is described in a previous

section.

mentioned above.

4. chiral primary operators for n = 2 quotient theories

4.1. conformal eld theory discussion

maldacenas conjecture has been extended to the case of orbifolds. in order to preserve

the conformal symmetry, we need to keep the ads part untouched and to act with orbifold
groups only on s5 [18,19,20,21].

an n = 2 theory is obtained if we act with a zn group on two out of three complex

elds, one of them being left unchanged. the zn quotienting is accompanied by a gauge

transformation.

are of the form trl

out of the chiral primaries of the n = 4 theory, those giving non-trivial operators
3 )l. as in the discussion of cutos for the
u (n n) theory we can write traces of powers of these elds in terms of products of traces

3, tr(12)l and tr(12m

when the power exceeds n n. for example this leads to

tr(3)n n+1 = tr(3)n ntr(3) +    ,

(4.3)

where the    stands for other terms involving other splittings of the (n n + 1)th power.

we can rewrite this as follows

tr(3)n n+1 = xi

tr( (i)

3 )n nxj

tr( (j)

3 ) +    .

(4.4)

note that the splitting involves factors which are separately zn invariant. the same holds
for other operators, e.g. tr(12)n n+1.

another kind of splitting occurs if we allow the factors to come from twisted sectors.

this splitting will happen at a dierent value of the powers, i.e at n + 1 rather than

n n + 1. it uses the fact that

tr( (i)

3 )n+1 = tr( (i)

3 )n tr( (i)

3 ) +    ,

and it leads to

tr(3)n+1 =

n

xi=1

(4.6)

now the factors are not separately invariant. they come from twisted sectors. similar

equations can be written for the other operators, for example,

tr(12)n+1 =

however as discussed in [21] the factors appearing on the right hand side in this expression

are not chiral primaries because they appear as derivatives of a superpotential.

4.2. quantum space explanation of the cutos

we saw in the previous subsection that if we start with a gauge theory with gauge

group u (n n) and take the zn quotient, we get a gauge theory with a product of u (n )

gauge groups. restricting attention to zn invariant operators, i.e the untwisted sector, we

nd that the cuto stays at n n. we expect on the gravity side that a discussion ignoring

the twisted sectors can be simply reproduced by studying a quotient of the q-sphere. we
found indeed in the previous section that after quotienting s5

q by a zn element inside the
soq(6), we are left with a surviving suq(2)  uq(1) with the same value of q that we

started with. this gives an explanation of the fact that the cuto  n n stays at  n n.

4.3. comments on twisted sectors

the quantum space explanation of the behaviour of the cutos when we include the

twisted sectors is much more intricate. this is only a preliminary discussion.

the twisted sector has to do with dimensional reduction on the singular cycles of

d4/zn followed by the reduction on s1 [21].

to understand the twisted sector chiral primaries from the gravity point of view in
the large n limit one starts with a description of s5/zn as s1 bred over b4/zn wher b4
is the 4-ball. ten-dimensional gravity is reduced on the b4/zn and then the kk reduction
on the s1 is performed. the cohomology of the blown-up b4/zn space is used to determine
the type of particles we get [21].

we can try to generalize this discussion to the case of s5

q /zn. the twisted sector
states are localized in the z1, z2 direction when the zn quotient acts in these directions.

the wavefunctions of the twisted sector states are arbitary functions of the phase of z3
and localized at z1 = z2 = 0 in the case q = 1. a very intriguing property of the s5
q we
described is that z1 = z2 = 0 is not compatible with the algebra (3.16) - (3.19) . in a

sense the origin of the ball is smoothed out. it would be very interesting if this result of

noncommutativity provides an eective way to describe the resolution of the xed point in

a similar way as [22] , where it was shown that the instanton moduli space can be resolved

by deforming the base space into a quantum space. another possibility is that we could

also have chosen to work with a zn action on z2, z3. in that case there is a circle over
z2 = z3 = 0 on s5
q . so to describe the twisted sector states, we need to extend the algebra
s5
q /zn by adding certain delta functions mutliplied with arbitrary powers of z3 ( with
unit norm ). the results from the eld theory suggest that this algebra should admit a

13

consistent truncation which restricts the u (1) charge at order n , since we saw that with
the cutos on single trace operators of the form trl
3 happens at order n . it will be very
interesting to see if the quantum space techniques can reproduce this eld theory result.

some relevant techniques on quantum principal bundles may be found in [23,24] and on

k-theory of quantum spaces in [25].

5. conclusions

in this paper we have considered the ads/cft conjecture for nite n conformal

theories. as opposed to the large n limit which relates the corresponding eld theories

and the classical supergravity, for nite n we need to consider quantum gravity. we

have taken the point of view that the nite n eects can be captured by gravity on a
q-deformed version of ads5  s5 space time where q is a root of unity along the lines of
[5]. we have discussed mainly the deformation of s5 into s5
q where q is a root of unity.
n +4 . this agrees
the kk reduction on this quantum sphere is truncated at n if q = e

i

with the cuto on the chiral primaries of nite n conformal eld theory obtained on the

boundary of ads5.

we then discussed the n = 2 quotient theories and the corresponding cuto in the

supergravity and eld theory. by considering only the untwisted sectors the result is that

the chiral primaries have the same cuto as in the initial n = 4 theory. this result could

be explained by considering a quotient of the quantum sphere. we also derived results in

eld theories regarding the cutos when twisted sectors are taken into account. we began

a discussion of the corresponding quantum space picture.

it would be interesting to extend the results of this paper for other orbifolds of s5, for
six dimensional eld theories obtained on the boundary of ads7 or for three dimensional
theories obtained on the boundary of ads4. some evidence for non-commutative gravity
in ads7  s4 background has been obtained in [26] and connections to the quantum group
approach will be interesting to explore.
