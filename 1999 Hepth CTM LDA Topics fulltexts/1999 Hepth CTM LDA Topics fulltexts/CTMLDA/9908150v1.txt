2 cosh  > 1, is satised.

in [1], a precise mechanism was presented for the production of closed timelike curves
(ctcs). in particular, the spacetime of two point particles with mass and boost parameters
 and , in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime with vanishing cosmological constant , was shown
to produce ctcs if the inequality, sin 
in [2, 3], this gott time
machine was analysed in terms of the group theoretic approach to point particles [4]. one
essential feature of this approach is that the point particle spacetime is obtained via a suitable
identication by an elliptic (timelike) generator of the isometry group. it was demonstrated
in [2, 3] that the eective two-particle generator (the gott time machine) becomes hyperbolic
(spacelike) precisely when the gott condition is satised. various arguments were then pre-
sented to ensure that such ctcs do not arise in physically acceptable spacetimes [2, 3, 5, 6].
the possibility that black hole formation could provide an escape route from the ctcs was
alluded to in [1]. however, the absence of a black hole spacetime with  = 0 means that this
route for chronology protection is unavailable.

it is noteworthy that in (2+1)-dimensional anti-de sitter gravity ( < 0), we do indeed have
the banados-teitelboim-zanelli (btz) black hole solution [7, 8], for a review see [9]. from our
point of view, the most important aspect of this black hole is that it is dened by a hyperbolic
isometry. one may choose a fundamental region of this hyperbolic isometry, and dene the
black hole spacetime by identication of the regions boundaries by the isometry. equivalently,
the black hole spacetime may be dened as the quotient of three-dimensional anti-de sitter
space (ads3) by the cyclic group generated by the hyperbolic isometry [8]. in this paper, we
show that the gott time machine, suitably extended to the anti-de sitter case, is precisely the
mechanism for btz black hole formation in particle collisions. if the gott condition is satised,
the eective two-particle generator becomes hyperbolic. thus, one can immediately identify the
resulting quotient spacetime as the btz black hole. this understanding of black hole formation
via the gott time machine is based simply on the observation that the formation of the black
hole is eected by the transition from two elliptic (particle) generators to a hyperbolic (black
hole) generator.

having understood btz black hole formation at the algebraic level, it is of interest to see
if this sheds light on the origin of choptuik scaling [10], for a review see [11]. interest in this
critical phenomenon is centered around the fact that the threshold for black hole formation in
the space of initial data has a simple structure. in particular, the black hole parameters exhibit
universal power-law scaling behaviour. we demonstrate that the natural order parameter for
btz black hole formation is the trace of the associated generator. in this way, we gain an exact
analytic understanding of choptuik scaling in 2 + 1 dimensions. it is then a simple matter to
read o the choptuik scaling, which has an exponent  = 1/2.

we recall [9] that ads3 can be viewed as the group manifold of sl(2, r), with isometry
group (sl(2, r)  sl(2, r))/z2. thus, for x  sl(2, r), the isometry group acts by left and
right multiplication, x  lxr, with the identication (l, r)  (l,r). we shall use
the equivalent su(1, 1) notation instead of sl(2, r); they are related by conjugation, which is
given explicitly in [12].

as shown in [4], the spacetime for a single static point particle with  = 0 is obtained by
removing a wedge of decit angle , and identifying opposite sides of the wedge. the particle
spacetime is dened via the rotation generator with angle ,

r() =   ei/2

the mass m of the particle is given by  = m, in units with 8g = 1, and the resulting
spacetime has a naked conical singularity.

a moving particle is obtained by boosting to the rest frame of the particle, rotating, and

then boosting back. the corresponding boost matrix is

since our considerations rest in anti-de sitter space, we simply note that the static and moving
particle spacetimes are dened in an analogous fashion, with left and right generators. particle
spacetimes for non-zero cosmological constant have been considered in [13].

to construct the gott time machine, we consider a two-body collision process, with particles
labelled by a and b. the eective two-particle generator is then the product [2, 3, 4], namely
t g = tbta. the central object of interest to us is the trace of this generator. using (4), it is
straightforward to compute

the original gott time machine is recovered by choosing particles with equal masses, and equal
and opposite boosts, namely a = b = , a = b = , a  b = . we nd

the signicance of this result can be appreciated by recalling that the isometries of ads3

are classied according to the value of their trace. we have

| tr t | < 2, elliptic,
| tr t | = 2, parabolic,
| tr t | > 2, hyperbolic.

thus, when the gott condition is satised, we have sin2 
hyperbolic generator, and when sin2 

2 cosh2  < 1, we have an elliptic generator.

2 cosh2  > 1, and thus t g is a

armed with this observation, we are now in a position to discuss the implications of the gott
time machine for black hole formation. first, we recall that the conventional mass parameter
of the btz black hole is denoted by m, while the point particle mass m is related by m =

2(1  m ). as a result, the point particle mass spectrum is 1 < m < 0, while the black
hole mass spectrum is m  0, with m = 1 corresponding to ads3.

let us rst consider the static black hole case, in which the left and right generators are
taken to be equal [9]. we recall also that the isometries of ads3 are subject to the identication
(l, r)  (l,r). thus, we may take l = r = t g  . the btz black hole is
dened as the quotient of ads3 by a cyclic group with a single hyperbolic generator [8]. if the
gott condition is satised, then as we have seen t g is a hyperbolic generator. thus, the gott
time machine results in btz black hole formation. the black hole mass is then given by [9, 12]

it is important to consider the dening equation of this process, namely

tbta = t g.

on the left-hand side, we have the input data given by the particle mass and boost parameters 
and . the incoming particles a and b have been set up in a symmetrical way, with equal mass
and boost parameters, and the timelike geodesics representing their worldlines will intersect at
a given time, say t = 0. thus, we may regard this as the time of collision of the two particles.
the product of the particle generators represents the eective generator of the system at this
time [14]. as we have seen, the eective generator at the time of collision is hyperbolic if the
gott condition is satised. we may then interpret equation (9) as dening the formation of
a btz black hole at time t = 0, with the value of the black hole mass xed by the input
parameters  and . thus, equation (9) encodes dynamical information. however, the precise
details of the motion of the particles corresponding to the generators ta and tb prior to the
collision, as well as the motion after collision may also be studied. indeed, this analysis has
been performed for massless particles in [14, 15].

we see from (8) that the natural order parameter for black hole formation in (2 + 1)-
dimensional anti-de sitter gravity is the trace of the generator. this takes a critical value at
the threshold for black hole formation, corresponding to the critical value of the parameter
p = 1. clearly, p = p corresponds to the black hole vacuum m = 0, where the gott generator
is parabolic. since the parameter p depends on the initial data  and , we can read o the
critical boost  for any given mass . as an example, taking  = /3, we have black hole
formation when cosh   2. we have

m = arccosh p = ln(cid:20)p +qp2  1(cid:21) .

(10)

we stress that the above expression is an exact analytic formula for the formation of a btz
black hole in terms of the input (initial) parameters  and , equivalently p. from this, we
can immediately determine the choptuik scaling, by studying the behaviour near p. the mass

3

m and horizon length r+ are related by m = r+/l, where l is the scale of ads3. writing
p = p + , we nd to leading order

r+
l

=

(p  p)1/2.

(11)

thus, we observe a scaling factor of  = 1/2. note that this is indeed a universal scaling since
btz formation always requires a hyperbolic generator. the universal scaling value of 1/2 is
simply a consequence of the fact that the mass depends on the inverse cosh function. we also
note that the derivative of the order parameter diverges at the critical value p.

if the gott condition is not satised, then one has an eective particle spacetime with an
elliptic generator, whose eective decit angle is denoted by e. this can be obtained by
continuation of (8) to negative m values. we nd,

tr  = cos m = 1 + 2 sin2

cosh2   p,

(12)

where now p < p. once again, we have an exact analytic expression for the mass parameter on
the other side of the transition, and of course the choptuik scaling exponent is again  = 1/2,
with

e = 2  22(p  p)1/2.

(13)

while the choptuik scaling is evident near the black hole threshold, we stress that in this model
we have recourse to the exact analytic expression (10).

to obtain the spinning btz black hole, we simply need to have independent left and right
generators, and these are also given in terms of the gott generators. taking a = b =
, a  b = 0, we nd the left generator l = t g, with
(r+  r)(cid:19) = 1 + 2 sin2 

tr l = cosh(cid:18)

for the right generator, we choose a = b = , a  b = , with r = t g, leading to

the input data for particles a and b is no longer symmetric, but nevertheless l and r both
become hyperbolic if the input parameters , a, b satisfy the appropriate gott conditions.
in the above, we have introduced the parameters r which denote the locations of the inner
and outer horizons [9]. they are related to the mass m and angular momentum j by m =
(r2
)/l2, j = 2r+r/l. in this case, we obtain choptuik scaling for both mass and angular
momentum in the form

as pointed out in [16], the euclidean btz black hole is a geometrically nite kleinian
manifold with the topology of a solid torus. in essence, this allows one to invoke a theorem of

4

sullivan [17, 18] to establish a no hair theorem for the euclidean black hole. as a result, the
black hole and its hyperbolic generators are described by at most two parameters. assuming
that the continuation to lorentzian signature does not induce additional parameters, one con-
cludes that the btz black hole is described by mass and angular momentum only. one can
consider many-body extensions of the gott time machine. by the above reasoning, these will
lead to the formation of a spinning btz black hole, if there are gott conditions which produce
independent left and right hyperbolic generators.

in conclusion, we have shown that the original gott time machine provides a precise mecha-
nism for btz black hole formation in particle collisions. the problems of ctcs and chronology
protection [19] are overcome by the creation of the black hole horizon, as soon as the gott con-
dition is satised. this is indeed a satisfying scenario. we mention that the recent study of
btz black hole formation from massless particle collisions [14, 15] is based on the lightlike
analogue of the gott time machine [20], and thus is also guaranteed to produce the hyperbolic
generator necessary for btz formation. the holographic description of this creation process
has been investigated within the ads/cft correspondence in [21]. a gott time machine in
anti-de sitter space was also studied in [22]. by denition, the btz black hole is dened as
the quotient spacetime of a hyperbolic generator. thus, irrespective of which type of matter
is used to produce such a black hole, the ultimate result is that the mass of the black hole
is dened via the trace of the hyperbolic generator. hence, choptuik scaling with a critical
exponent  = 1/2 will always be present. indeed, this exponent was observed for collapsing
dust shells in [23].
