abstract

in this short note we review the main features of open-string orbifolds
with a quantised ux for the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor in the context
of the open descendants of non-supersymmetric asymmetric orbifolds
with a vanishing cosmological constant.

recently we have analysed in some detail the complete structure of
the one-loop amplitudes for open strings [1, 2] on orbifolds [3] with a
quantised ns-ns antisymmetric tensor background [4], thus extending
the results in [5]. besides recovering the expected rank reduction for
the chan-paton (cp) gauge group, we were led to identify the discrete
wilson lines of [6] with the signs  that enforce a correct normalisation
of the mobius amplitude. in particular, for z2 orbifolds, they allow one
to connect continuously u(n) groups to sp(n)  sp(n) groups. in this
brief note we want to reconsider the non-supersymmetric type i vacua
with vanishing cosmological constant discussed in [7, 8] in the spirit of
[4]. we refer to the original papers for more details and for references.
non-supersymmetric vacua with a vanishing cosmological constant
can be obtained as asymmetric orbifolds of type ii and/or type i super-
strings. the simplest instance of these models can be obtained consid-

ering the generators [9]

f = [(14, 1; 15), (04, vl; 4, vr), (1)fr] ,
g = [(15;14, 1), (4, wl; 04, wr), (1)fl ] .

the rst entry in the square brackets denotes rotations, the second de-
notes shifts on the internal compactication lattice while the third corre-
sponds to the space-time fermion-number. the shift  acts as a z2-shift,
whereas vl,r (= wr,l) act as an a2 shift [10] on the fth coordinate.
the asymmetric nature of the orbifold together with level matching, re-
quire that the internal 4d lattice split into a product of four circles at
the radius of su(2) enhanced symmetry. actually, the algebra of the
generators (1.1) reveals that f and g generate a non-abelian space group
orbifold s [11]. the restriction to the point group p = s/{f 2, g2}, with
f 2 and g2 pure translations, eectively changes the lattice to an so(8)
lattice, thus introducing a non-vanishing background for the b-eld

we have already noticed in [8] how the choice of the internal so(8)
lattice is crucial in order to get a consistent result.
in fact, the orb-
ifold that we are considering can be thought as an f (or g) projection
of the supersymmetric t 4/z2 orbifold generated by f g, with the t 4
corresponding to the so(8) lattice. the resulting torus amplitude
t0  |v4o4|2 + |s4s4|2  (o4v4)( c4 c4)  (c4c4)( o4 v4) + . . .

is then consistent with the generic klein bottle amplitude1 (that, roughly
speaking feels only the left-right symmetric generator f g) [4]

only for an internal so(8) lattice, where the volume v = 1
2 and r = 2.
thus k0 contains only those states that in t0 are combined with their
antiholomorphic counterparts. the same phenomenon also presents it-
self in the open sector, upon identication of neumann and dirichlet

1in our case the spinors have a ipped chirality, since the supersymmetric z2 generator f g
contains (1)fl+fr together with the standard inversions.

cp charges as a result of modding out by the t-duality contained in f .
as a result of the action of f , the cp gauge group is reduced further
and turns into in a single u(8) factor [7, 8]. actually, this is the case
if we break the residual internal global so(4)2 symmetry by introduc-
ing discrete wilson lines in the mobius amplitude, thus aecting the
2 transformation, that acts on the real hatted characters
p = t
[6, 4]. let us analyse the massless contribution to the transverse-channel
mobius amplitude:

where with have explicitly written the contribution of the internal bosons.
on the so(4) (hatted) characters ( o4, v4, s4, c4), the p matrix acts as
diag(1, 1), with 1 the rst pauli matrix. as a result, the space-time
vector contributes to

thus calling for a product of symplectic gauge groups sp(8)  sp(8),
consistently with the tadpole conditions. the resulting model is still
supersymmetric at all mass levels in the open sector, while it is non-
supersymmetric in the closed sector. this has to be contrasted with the
recently proposed scenario [12, 4] where supersymmetry is unbroken in
the bulk (at any mass level) but is broken on branes, where a positive
cosmological constant is generated at one loop.

the u(8) model of [7, 8] is obtained introducing in m discrete wilson
lines, that result in primed so(4) characters associated to the internal
lattice [6, 4]:

o4 = o2 o2  v2 v2  o
v4 = o2 v2 + v2 o2  v 

4 = o2 o2 + v2 v2 ,
4 = o2 v2  v2 o2 ,

whose p transformation is now given by the pauli matrix 3 acting on
( o

consistently with a unitary cp gauge group.

although this latter choice has a sensible geometric 6d decompact-
ication limit, it is not naturally related to the rational so(8) internal
lattice. in fact, it is the sp(8) sp(8) model that, in the 6d decompact-
ication limit, leads to the sp(8)4 model of [2, 6, 13] pertaining to the
rational so(8) lattice.
