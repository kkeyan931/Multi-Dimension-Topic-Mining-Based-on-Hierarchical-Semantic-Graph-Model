after a brief historical survey that emphasizes the role of the algebra obeyed by
the dirac operator, we examine an algebraic dirac operator associated with lie
algebras and lie algebra cosets. for symmetric cosets, its massless solutions
display non-relativistic supersymmetry, and can be identied with the massless
degrees of freedom of some supersymmetric theories: n = 1 supergravity in eleven
dimensions (m-theory), type iib string theory in ten and four dimensions, and in
four dimensions, n = 8 supergravity, n = 4 super-yang-mills, and the n = 1
wess-zumino multiplet. by generalizing this dirac operator to the ane case, we
generate superconformal algebras associated with cosets g/h, where h contains
the space little group. only for eleven dimensional supergravity is h simple. this
suggests, albeit in a non-relativistic setting, that these may be the limit of theories
with underlying two-dimensional superconformal structure.

1 historical remarks

the development of supersymmetry in the western world and in the eastern
world of the time was very dierent. in this book there are a number of contri-
butions that tell the story from the eastern side. in the soviet scientic society
the scientists had one freedom that scientists in the west lacked and still lack
(perhaps the only real freedom that eastern scientists had), and that was to
spend time also on esoteric questions. they did not have to be scrutinized
by funding agencies every now and then. as one consequence of this fact, the
soviet scientists of the time were often very well trained in basic formalisms.
they had in many cases a superior knowledge in fermion elds and their treat-
ment in quantum eld theory, which is very well witnessed in the brilliant
book by berezin 1. this background was fertile ground for work leading up to
supersymmetry. to us it seems that the development resulting in the work of
yurij golfand and evgenij likhtman 2 was a natural one (without meaning to
underestimate its fundamental importance). by studying quantum eld theory

1

per se without the need to directly correlate it to particle physics of the time
it is a clever but also a natural idea to look for a symmetry between bosons
and fermions. quantum eld theory that was essentially abandoned in the
west because of its severe diculties to go beyond qed, certainly needed new
elements. to match the number of bosonic degrees of freedom to the fermionic
ones was not a natural idea in the west in the 60s which was in the midst of
the quark model and current algebra. of course, a superalgebra in terms of
the anticommutator of the two dirac operators was certainly known but not
given much importance. abdus salam and collaborators 3 had been interested
in functional integrations over spinors in the 50s but had not completed the
issue as berezin had done. however, once four-dimensional supersymmetry
became popular in the west, abdus salam became very active and had a huge
experience to draw from. however, yurij golfand might very well have been
the only one who seriously pushed a four-dimensional fermionic symmetry in
quantum eld theory in the late 60s.

in the west the abandonment of quantum eld theory for the strong inter-
actions led to s-matrix theory and to a detailed study of the possible analytic
structure of this matrix. more and more resonances were found in the strong
interactions experiments, and in 1968 gabriele veneziano 4 managed to con-
struct an s-matrix (a dual resonance model) for four bosons that incorporated
innitely many resonances with the necessary analytic structure for a born-
term. this was the starting point for string theory in that slightly later it
was understood to describe scattering of string states. the important point
we want to make is that this development was very much inuenced by the
experimental discoveries of the time. particle physics was still quite young and
the theorists in the west were very much involved in constructing models for
the experimental data that kept pouring out. after venezianos fundamental
work it was so natural to ask how to implement fermions into dual resonance
model. this was not an easy task since the model was formulated just as
a scattering amplitude. the key to solve this was the realization of the un-
derlying two-dimensional world sheet. venezianos model described scattering
based on bosonic degrees of freedom on the world-sheet. to introduce space-
time spinors the natural thing was then to introduce fermions on the world
sheet 5. in this process it was realized that two-dimensional supersymmetry
was needed to get a viable model and this was the start of supersymmetry in
the west. the symmetry even had to be a superconformal symmetry and the
ordinary supersymmetry came out as a zero-mode. supersymmetry hence was
a result of the direct strive to nd a model to describe the strong interactions.
the fact that the two rst papers of supersymmetry in the west and the east
were submitted at about the same time in late 1970 is quite remarkable.

2

in the 30 years since this development took place the two lines of theoretical
research described above have converged. the development of supersymmetric
gauge eld theories and superstring theory took us out of contact with much
of the experimental data of today. the success of superstring theory builds to
a large extent on our increased mathematical insight and this has spurred us
to look for new structures. the science of today is very much depending on
our attempts to nd those and now we cannot only rely on experimental data
to lead our way. the studies of superstring theory and supersymmetric gauge
theory per se have led us to all the wonderful discoveries of recent years. it
is hence very much worthwhile to study new structures in mathematics and
try to connect such developments to modern string theory. the understanding
of m-theory as an 11-dimensional theory which is not a regular string theory
has made us go back to a study of group theory to look for alternatives to
supersymmetry and in this contribution we will discuss some recent studies of
ours which we hope will shed new light on even more fundamental levels of
physics than superstrings.

2 supersymmetry and the dirac equation

it was known since the early days of quantum mechanics that the dirac equa-
tion

p/  = 0 ,

(1)

contains a new type of anticommuting symmetry, since the dirac operator
obeys the superalgebra

{ p/, p/ } = p2 ,

[ p/, p2 ] = [ p2, p2 ] = 0 .

(2)

however, in ordinary quantum eld theory this symmetry was not really used.
in the development of the veneziano model in the late 60s it was however re-
alized that the modes of p2 when taken to be a function of a complex variable
(of the euclideanized world-sheet) span the two-dimensional conformal alge-
bra, the virasoro algebra 6. this algebra is the underlying symmetry algebra of
the model and it was natural to seek to generalize this algebra to also contain
fermions 5. the key then was to generalize the -matrices to also be functions
of this complex variable. this led to the superconformal algebra and even-
tually to the superstring model. as a by-product one got the 2-dimensional
supersymmetry algebra. strings naturally demanded 2-dimensional supersym-
metry and eventually it was also realized that they demand supersymmetry in
the target space.

in the struggle to nd realistic string models the rst attempts were to
generalize the superconformal algebra. such a generalization was nally found

3

in the n = 2 string 7 where n refers to the underlying superconformal alge-
bra. when the superstring was properly understood as unifying theories of all
interactions it was clear that the original one was the most promising and the
challenge was then to understand the 10-dimensional space on which it lives.
in this way we obtained the ve superstring models and opened up the road
to compactications. with the advent of m-theory as a non-standard string
theory we have found it worthwhile to study again the roots of supersymmetry
and its role in string theory. the superconformal generator is part of the su-
perconformal algebra used as the gauge algebra of the model and since in string
theory the target manifold contains the four-dimensional minkowski space the
zero mode part gives that states in the r-sector must satisfy the dirac equation
in minkowski space. in the sequel we will study dirac equations on other types
of manifolds and check when the massless states coincide with interesting
multiplets.

3 kostants operator

as we have seen, in formulating supersymmetric theories, it is natural to focus
on the dirac operator.
it is then interesting to note that for any manifold
with dimension equal to that of a lie algebra, or for any coset generated lie
algebra embeddings, there exists a natural dirac-like operator 8. for compact
lie algebras, this dirac operator has only massive solutions. however, the
dirac operator associated with symmetric cosets has massless solutions, some
of which display manifest supersymmetry. in the sequel we will use this method
to generate supermultiplets. the method will be group theoretical and the
relation to space-time symmetries will not be obvious.

3.1

lie algebras

consider a d dimensional lie algebra, g, dened by the commutation relations

[t a, t b] = if abct c ,

(3)

with a, b, c =, . . . , d. on this d-dimensional vector space, the d dirac matrices
which satisfy the cliord algebra

(4)
are realized in terms of 2d  2d matrices (for d even). we now dene the
kostant-dirac operator

in the cliord algebra, it has the remarkable property that

{k/,k/} = 2c2 +

cadjt

(6)

where c2 is the quadratic casimir operator of the representation of the t a
matrices, and cadjt
is the quadratic casimir of the adjoint representation of
the algebra. because the algebra is compact, the square is the sum of two
positive terms, and the solution to the massless equation k/  = 0 is trivial,
although there are many states on which k/ takes on a constant value. we note
that

where the diagonal matrix operators

with

generate the representation of the algebra g on the spinor space of so(d).
thus the solutions of (k/ ) = 0 will assemble in full multiplets of g for
special values of the mass .

3.2 lie algebra cosets

consider any lie algebra, g, generated by the t a, a = 1, 2, . . . , d. inside that
lie algebra lies a subalgebra, h  g, generated by t i, i = 1, 2, . . . , d. we label
the remaining (d  d) generators as t m. the commutation relations are

[ t i , t j ] = if ijkt k ,
[ t i , t m ] = if imnt n ,
[ t m, t n] = if mnjt j + if mnpt p .

(10)
consider the (d  d) even-dimensional coset space, where the m are 2dd 
2dd matrices that satisfy

the kostant operator associated with the coset is dened as

{m, n} = 2mn .

which is not positive denite: the massless kostant equation can have non-
trivial solutions. the operators

si =

(14)

represent the subalgebra h on the (d  d) coset space. the subalgebra h is
generated by the diagonal sum

li = t i + si ,

i = 1, 2 . . . , d

which commute with the kostant operator

hence, solutions of

[li ,k/ ] = 0 .

k/  = 0 ,

(15)

(16)

(17)

can be assembled in full multiplets of the subalgebra h.

when g and h have the same rank, these solutions reside in the tensor

product 9,11

(18)
where s are the two spinor representations of so(d  d), and v is a rep-
resentation of g of highest weight , with all representations decomposed in
terms of those of the subalgebra h.

v  s+  v  s ,

we specialize our discussion to symmetric coset space g/h, for which
fmnp = 0 a. in that case, it is only when v is the singlet of g that there
are no cancellations of representations in eq.(18).
it follows that the solu-
tions of the kostant-dirac equation span the two spinor representations of
so(d  d). since these are well-known to be generated by a cliord algebra,
they necessarily exhibit supersymmetry in terms of the subalgebra h.
on the other hand, if v is taken to be any non-trivial representation of
g, cancellations always occur, and the solutions no longer display manifest
supersymmetry.

it is also known that the number of irreps of h appearing in this dierence is
always the same, and equal to r, the ratio of the orders of the weyl groups of g

awhen the coset space is not symmetric, fmnp 6= 0, there are always cancellations, even
when v is a singlet, and no manifest supersymmetry.

6

and h, which is also the euler number of the coset manifold. in some cases, the
r-plets, or euler multiplets, have the same number of bosons and fermions 10,
but no apparent supersymmetry, which make them very interesting from a
quantum mechanical point of view. we will not pursue this line of thinking in
this paper. indeed, it has been shown that

v  s+  v  s =

r

xc

(1)w uc ,

(19)

where the sum is over the r elements of the weyl group of g that are not in hs,
and uc denote representations of h, and the  denotes a specic construction
which has been dened elsewhere 9,11.
to summarize, the solutions of the massless kostant operator appear in
euler multiplets, one for each representation of g. each euler multiplet con-
tains exactly r irreps of the subalgebra h. for symmetric coset spaces, the
euler multiplet associated with the singlet of g spans a cliord algebra, and
therefore displays supersymmetry.

3.3 supersymmetric euler multiplets

it is well-known that the degrees of freedom of supersymmetric theories can
be labelled in terms of the wigner little group of the associated poincare
algebra. since theories with gravity cannot sustain a nite number of massless
degrees of freedom with spin higher than two, the cosets cannot exceed sixteen
dimensions, which yield the two spinor representations of so(16), with 256
degrees of freedom.

we have found only a few cosets, with d  d = 16, 8, 4, for which the
basic euler multiplets have the right quantum numbers to represent massless
particles of relativistic theories:

 16-dimensional cosets

the 256 states of the associated cliord are generated by the two spinor irreps
of so(16), yielding four possibilities:

 su (9)  su (8)  u (1) with lowest euler multiplet

12  83/2  281  561/2  700  561/2  281  83/2  12

interpreting the u (1) as the helicity little group in four dimensions, these
can be thought of as the massless spectrum of either type iib string
theory, or of n = 8 supergravity.

7

 so(10)  so(8)  so(2) with lowest euler multiplet

12  83/2  281  561/2  (350  350)  561/2  281  83/2  12

viewing so(8) as the little group in ten dimensions, these may represent
the massless spectrum of iib superstring in ten dimensions, but only after
using so(8) triality. alternatively, with u (1) as the helicity, it could just
be the massless particle content of the type iib superstring theory, or of
n = 8 supergravity in four dimensions.

 su (6)  so(6)  so(3)  so(2) with lowest euler multiplet

(1, 1)2  (4, 2)3/2  (10, 1)1  (6, 3)1  (4, 4)1/2  (20, 2)1/2

 (20, 1)0  (15, 3)0  (1, 5)0

(4, 4)1/2  (20, 2)1/2  (10, 1)1  (6, 3)1  (4, 2)3/2  (1, 1)2 .
this is the massless spectrum of n = 8 supergravity, or of type iib
superstring in four dimensions, or of massless theories in ve and eight
dimensions.

 f4  so(9) the lowest euler multiplet

44  84  128

describes the massless spectrum of n = 1 supergravity in 11 dimensions,
the local limit of m-theory, by identifying so(9) as the massless little
group.

 8-dimensional cosets

the cliord algebra is realized on the 16 states that span the two spinor irreps
of so(8), leading to the two massless interpretations

 su (5)  su (4)  u (1) which yields the lowest euler multiplet

11  41/2  60  41/2  11

with u (1) as the helicity little group, this particle content is the same
as the massless spectrum of n = 4 yang-mills in four dimensions.

it could also describe a massless theory in eight dimensions with one
conjugate spinor, one vector, and two scalars, since su (4)  so(6).

8

 so(6)  so(4)  so(2) with lowest euler multiplet

(1, 1)1  (2, 2)1/2  (1, 3)0  (3, 1)0  (2, 2)1/2  (1, 1)1

this particle content is the same as the n = 4 yang-mills in four dimen-
sions, or the n = 2 vector supermultiplet in ve dimensions.

 4-dimensional cosets

the cliord algebra is realized on 4 states of the two spinor irreps of so(4).
they appear as the lowest euler multiplet in the following decomposition:

 su (3)  su (2)  u (1). the lowest euler multiplet

11/2  20  11/2

can be interpreted as a relativistic theory in 4 dimensions, since the u (1)
charges are half integers and integers, and it can describe the massless
n = 1 wess-zumino supermultiplet in four dimensions, as well as a
massless supermultiplet in ve dimensions.

so far, we have limited our discussion to massless degrees of freedom, but
we should note for completeness that possible relativistic theories with massive
degrees of freedom appear in the cosets sp(2p + 2)  sp(2p )  sp(2) with
the same content as massive n = p supersymmetry in four dimensions. the
massive n = 4 supermultiplet in four dimensions is also described by the
coset so(8)  so(4)  so(4), and the massive n = 2 supermultiplet in four
dimensions can be described in terms of g2/su (2)  su (2).
in this section, we have shown that the degrees of freedom of some su-
persymmetric theories are solutions of the kostant-dirac equation associated
with specic cosets. while non-relativistic, this identication is suggestive of
an alternate description, in which the states appear as solutions of an operator
equation, not as fundamental elds in a lagrangian. this is of course reminis-
cent of what happens in string theory. furthermore, not all supersymmetric
theories appear in this list, only the local limit of m-theory, of type iib super-
string theories (not type iia, type i, nor heterotic superstrings), and certain
local eld theories, n = 4 yang-mills, and n = 1 wess-zumino multiplets. all
the massless cosets are both hermitian and symmetric, except for the wess-
zumino multiplet and n = 1 supergravity in eleven dimensions which are only
symmetric.

to take advantage of these alternate descriptions, the kostant-dirac op-
erator must be given a fundamental role. in the next section, we propose one

9

approach where the kostant-dirac operator is the zero mode of the super-
conformal generator associated with the coset, constructed some years ago by
kazama and suzuki 13.

4 coset construction of superconformal algebras

one can construct an ane generalization of the kostant-dirac operator, much
in the same way the dirac equation was generalized many years ago: one
generalizes the cliord matrices to the world sheet as

a  a() ,

with

as well as the generators

{a(), b()} = 2ab(  ) ,

t a  t a() ,

which satisfy the level k kac-moody commutation relations

[t a(), t b()] = if abit i()(  ) + kab(  ) .

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

these are the cosets of the full kac-moody algebra of ane g, with the addi-
tional commutation relations (we limit our discussion to symmetric cosets)

[t i(), t b()] = if iabt b()(  ) ,

[t i(), t j()] = if ijkt k()(  ) + kij(  ) .
these two algebras are independent and commute with one another

[a(), t b()] = 0 .

the generators

f ()  a()t a() =

alternatively, the virasoro generators can be summarized in

after getting rid of a surface term. this can be rewritten as

(42)

hence, the massless degrees of freedom of the previous section, are the ground
states of the superconformal algebra in the fermion sector. these states form
euler multiplets of representations of h, but they contain no oscillator modes.
the oscillator modes of this superconformal algebra come from two places,
the ba
n which appear in the generalized dirac matrices, and transform as spinors
of h, and the modes which appear in the construction of the g kac-moody
algebra. there are several ways to generate this algebra 12, by means of:

 a current algebra as a bilinear in fermion oscillators transforming as some
representation of g, in which case, k is the second-order dynkin index of
the representation.

 a bosonic wznw construction.
 a vertex construction, only if g is simply-laced, with k = 1.

each of these constructions yields a denite level k, and therefore a dierent
c-number for the associated superconformal algebra.

the role of the c-number in this work is not yet clear, since the use of the
superconformal algebra advocated here is hardly conventional: the unbroken
subgroup h, or parts thereof is not an internal symmetry group, but a space
group. as a consequence both space-time bosons and fermions reside in the
r-sector. on the other hand, the description is non-relativistic: the hilbert
space is manifestly positive denite, but relativistic invariance is highly non-
trivial to prove, and we surmise that relativistic invariance could be possible,
if at all, only for special values of the anomaly.

in this work, we do not attempt a proof of relativistic invariance, but only
oer two examples which set forth necessary conditions for these theories to
be relativistic.

consider the lowest euler multiplet of the f4/so(9) coset theory, which
describes the massless degrees of freedom of the n = 1 supergravity in eleven
dimensions, with so(9) identied as the massless little group. the oscillators
of this theory come from two places, those in the generalized dirac matrices,

12

which transforms as the real 16 spinor of so(9), and the oscillators which
build up the f4 kac-moody algebra.

if the oscillator modes of this superconformal theory are to describe mas-
sive degrees of freedom, a necessary condition for a relativistic description is
that they assemble themselves in representations of the massive little group,
so(10). as we s ee in the two examples below, this depends on the realization
of the kac-moody algebra:

 first, we assume a current algebra realization of the f4 kac-moody al-
gebra, with the fermions transforming as the lowest dimensional repre-
sentation, the real 26. in terms of so(9), 26 = 1  9  16. thus the
hilbert space of this superconformal coset algebra is generated by

 two oscillators, each transforming as the real 16 of so(9),

 one so(9) vector oscillator

 one so(9) singlet oscillator.

these degrees of freedom could be assembled in representations of so(10):
the two real spinors into the complex 16 spinor of so(10), and the singlet
and so(9) vector into the vector 10 of so(10). this counting does not
prove that this theory can be made relativistic, only that some necessary
conditions are met.

 as a second example, consider a current algebra with fermions in the 52

of f4. since 52 = 36  16, we end up with
 two oscillators, each transforming as the real 16 of so(9),

 one oscillator transforming as the 36.

to obtain a representation of so(10), we would need an so(9) vector
in to complete the 45 of so(10). thus a relativistic description seems
implausible in this case.

those two cases are distinguished by their kac-moody level, and thus by the c-
number of the consequent virasoro algebra. one value may lead to a relativistic
theory, while another cannot.

finally, we note the values of the conformal anomaly for the cosets we
have listed, suggesting possible connections between (massless and massive)
theories:

 c = 24k/(k + 9) for su (9)/su (8)  u (1) and f4/so(9).
 c = 24k/(k + 8) for so(10)/so(8)  u (1).

13

 c = 24k/(k + 6) for sp(10)/sp(8)  sp(2).
 c = 12k/(k + 5) for su (5)/su (4)  u (1).
 c = 12k/(k + 4) for so(6)/so(4)  so(2), sp(6)/sp(4)  sp(2), and

g2/su (2)  su (2).

 c = 6k/(k + 3) for su (3)/su (2)  u (1).

work is in progress to determine the representations of these superconformal
algebras, in order to see if their spectrum displays relativistic properties.

5 euler multiplets for su (3)/su (2)  u (1)
we know from the work of lerche et al 11, kostant 8 and gkrs 9 that for this
equal rank embedding, there are an innite number of euler triples. associated
with the [a1 a2] representation of su (3) (in dynkinese), the solutions consist
of the su (2)  u (1) multiplets

[a1 + a2 + 1](a1a2)/6  [a1](2a2+a1+3)/6  [a2](2a1+a2+3)/6 .

(43)

it is instructive to show in detail how these solutions arise.

it is convenient to act on the four-dimensional coset with the 44 matrices

where the a are the gell-mann matrices, and a(a) represent three ladder
operators a(a

for each representation of su (3), there are three solutions of the kostant-dirac
equations. the simplest solutions are just constant entries times the oscillator
vacuum state. under the diagonal subgroup, they split into two singlets

(65)

it does not seem possible to write the states at the next level in the same way;
yet they carry much of the same structure as those of the ground state.
one can build ladder operators which make transitions between one triple
and the next. there are two such operators, a doublet d with t8 = 1/(23),
and a singlet s with t8 = 1/3, with matrix representation

let us normalize the value of t8 so as to give the singlets in the lowest triple
values of 1/2 which are natural if one wants to think of the u (1) as the
poincare group helicity. then the ladder operators have helicities of 1/6 and
1/3, respectively, which makes little sense, unless we consider the continuous
spin representations of the poincare group. it is therefore doubtful that these
operators can be explained in the usual relativistic framework.

6 conclusions

in this paper, we have drawn attention to certain intriguing facts:

 the massless degrees of freedom of certain local theories, some of which
are local limits of more elaborate theories (m-theory, type iib super-
string theory), can be viewed as solutions of an algebraic dirac-like
equation. this raises the possibility of an alternate formulation for these
theories.

 this dirac-like equation can be identied with the zero-mode of the su-
perconformal generator in the kazama-suzuki coset construction. these
might therefore stem from theories with an underlying two-dimensional
structure.

many questions remain unanswered, notably,

 how is the ground state euler multiplet selected?
 what is the role of the other euler multiplets?

17

 what is the spectrum of these superconformal theories?
 is their spectrum relativistic, and under what conditions?
 what are the interactions?

until these questions are answered, one cannot claim that the suggestions in
this paper are physically relevant, but our list includes many theories of great
interest, namely n = 4 super-yang-mills, type iib superstring theory, and
most notably, n = 1 supergravity in eleven dimensions. the latter is the local
limit of m-theory, which raises the possibility that m-theory also displays an
underlying two-dimensional structure, (perhaps holographically related to a
membrane?). equally intriguing is the appearance of the exceptional group f4
in the description of its space degrees of freedom of this theory.

we dedicate this work to the memory of the late professor golfand.
