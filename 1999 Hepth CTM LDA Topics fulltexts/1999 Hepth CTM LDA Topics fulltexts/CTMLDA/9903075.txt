(10) general, replacement commutation relation moyal bracket introduces two new variables, say, x p transfers original equa- tion 2 dimensional higher equation compensation loss matrix. assume functions constituting equa- tion (10) written product function induced variable x function another induced variable p a0(x0, x1; x, p) = xk a1(x0, x1; x, p) = xl ekpak(x0, x1; x), elpbl(x0, x1; x). (11) (12) k l run positive and/or non-positive integers choice determines soliton equation. specication range k l together coecients leads various soliton equations. expansions compared inverse scattering method potentials expanded terms spectral parameter. ep plays role spectral parameter. zero-curvature equation (10) implies set equations taken order power ep. therefore, transition moyal version soliton equation, add two dimensions one dimension original equation. previous paper, obtained algebra composed brackets operators exponentiation operators satisfying conformal algebra. brackets found identical derived moyal algebra reduction assuming functions x p expanded e0 ep. restriction functions ep depen- dences implies limitation potentials take value cartan simple algebra. following examples (i) (ii) fall case. allow ep dependences. example could found (iii). 4 shall put ansatz = a(r; x, p) = a(t; x, p) x0 = 0 x1 = r identify examples well-known equa- tions. leads either da0 dr da1 dt = {a0, a1}, = {a1, a0}, respectively. shall consider several examples below. (i)toda lattice equation assume a1(t; x, p) = b(t; x) + a0(t; x, p) = 1 2 equation (14) implies 1 2 a(t; x)(ep + ep), a(t; x)(ep + ep). b(t; x) = dt a(t; x)ep = {aep, be0}. {aep, aep}, 1 2 dt using (6), dt b(t; x) = 1 2"a2(t; x + ) a2(t; x )#, "b(t; x + ) b(t; x )#a(t; x). 1 dt a(t; x) = equations lead d2 dt2 (t; x) = 1 2"e(t;x+2) 2e(t;x) + 2e(t;x2)#, (t; x) = 2 log a(t; x). 5 (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) impose condition x = n, (n z) equation, nd equation regarded toda lattice equation except end points equations dierent equation. shows important aspect moyal version soliton equation. toda lattice equation written terms cartan matrix reects algebra choose. toda lattice equation nite size particles corresponds choice nite dimensional algebra an. present type equation either toda lattice equation innite number particles link. mathematically derived assuming kac-moody algebra denoted an,1, respectively. hand, known 0 limit moyal algebra leads poisson bracket. identifying moyal algebra su(n) algebra one sets relation 1 n , means nite corresponds nite n i.e.nite number particles. shows moyal version soliton equation derives soliton equation periodic boundary condition algebraic specication an,1. take 0 limit eqs.(17) (18) using eq.(7); b(t; x) = a(t; x)ep = 2a a2 x b x , ep. (23) (24) thus obtain continuous counterpart toda lattice equation quite naturally: 2 t2 2 x2 (t; x) = 4 e(t;x). (25) (ii)bogomolny equation assume a0(r; x, p) = e0(r) + a1(r; x, p) = 1 2 eq.(13) implies 1 2 (epf (r; x) + epf (r; x)), (epf (r; x) epf (r; x)). e0 dr = 1 2 {epf, epf }, 6 (26) (27) (28) ep df dr ep df dr = {e0, epf }, = {e0, epf }. equivalently, written d(r; x) dr df (r; x) dr df (r; x) dr = = = 1 1 2"|f (x + )|2 |f (x )|2#, "(r; x + ) (r; x )#, "(r; x + ) (r; x )#. 1 lead d2 dr2 (r; x) = 1 2 , (r; x) = log |f (r; x)|2. (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) taking 0 limit moyal brackets, rewrite eqs.(28)- (30) using derivative operators instead dierences. thus obtain continuous limit bogomolny equation 2 r2 (r; x) = 4 2 x2 e(r;x), (36) interpreted su() bogomolny equation. (iii)km equation example case expansion potentials include e2p terms besides ep terms, means expansion algebra counterpart taking value cartan sub algebra simple roots contrast previous examples. assuming a1(t; x) = a(t; x)(ep + ep), (37) a0(t; x) = " {a(t; x)ep, a(t; x)ep}+ + {a(t; x)ep, a(t; x)ep}+#,(38) 7 obtain (14) dt a(t; x)ep = {aep, {aep, aep}+}, dt a(t; x) = 2 "a2(t; x + 2) a2(t; x 2)#a(t; x). written dt u(t; x) = 4 "eu(t;x+2) eu(t;x2)#, u(t; x) = 2 log a(t; x). (39) (40) (41) (42) equation discussed kac van maerbeke(km). also obtain continuous limit; u(t; x) = 16 x eu(t;x).
