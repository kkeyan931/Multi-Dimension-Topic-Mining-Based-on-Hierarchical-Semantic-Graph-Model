abstract

we consider contributions to the heavy quark potential, in the ads/cft approach to
su(n) gauge theory, which arise from rst order uctuations of the associated worldsheet
in anti-desitter space. the gaussian uctuations occur around a classical worldsheet con-
guration resembling an innite square well, with the bottom of the well lying at the ads
horizon. the eigenvalues of the corresponding laplacian operators can be shown numeri-
cally to be very close to those in at space. we nd that two of the transverse world sheet
elds become massive, which may have implications for the existence of a luscher term in
the heavy quark potential. it is also suggested that these massive degrees of freedom may
relate to extrinsic curvature of the qcd string.

1 introduction

maldacenas conjecture [1], relating the large n expansion of conformal elds to string
theory in a non-trivial geometry, has led to the hope that non-perturbative features of
large n theories may be understood. wittens extension [2] of this conjecture to non-
supersymmetric gauge theories, such as large n qcd in four dimensions, provides a new
and elegant approach to the study of gauge theory at strong couplings.

in wittens approach the heavy quark potential has a linear behaviour [25]. in this
approach the temperature t in the higher dimensional theory acts as an ultraviolet cuto,
and the strong coupling g2
y m n is the bare coupling at the scale t . the problem is, of course,
how to extend this to lower coupling, and whether one encounters a phase transition on
the way, as discussed in [6].

in the approach of refs. [25] the interquark potential has been extracted at the saddle
point. in the present paper we extend this by including uctuations of the world sheet
to rst order. the present paper was initiated as a sequel to a previous letter [7], where
we have called attention to two features of strong-coupling, planar qcd3 in the saddle
point approximation, which do not entirely agree with expectations based on lattice qcd.
first, there is the fact that the glueball mass is essentially independent of string tension
in the strong-coupling supergravity calculation [8], and goes to a nite constant in the
   limit. this is quite dierent from the behavior in strong-coupling lattice gauge
theory, where a glueball is understood as a closed loop of electric ux whose mass tends to
innity in the innite tension limit, and it suggests that truly dierent physical mechanisms
may underlie the mass gap in the two cases. the second point concerns the existence of a
universal luscher term of the form c/l in the interquark potential. here c is a numerical,
coupling independent, constant. recent lattice monte carlo simulations [9] indicate the
presence of such a term in qcd3, with a value of c consistent with that of a bosonic string,
although there is a caveat that c/l represents a quite small correction to the dominating
linear potential, and the magnitude of c is not yet well determined numerically. following
the approach of refs. [25], we have found that the interquark potential extracted from
the saddle point action of a classical worldsheet in ads5  s5, has no luscher term at all,
which seems to contradict the existing trend in the monte carlo data.
it is quite possible, however, that the luscher term arises beyond the classical world-
sheet approximation, when quantum uctuations of the worldsheet in ads5  s5 are taken
into account [1012]. this question is the main motivation for the work reported in the
present paper.

in section 2 we study the background eld in the saddle point for large interquark
distances. it turns out that the radial ads coordinate u [1] of the string worldsheet is
situated at the horizon, except for a small interval in parameter space near the end points
 = l/2, where u is forced to shoot up to innity. in section 3 we introduce kruskal-like
coordinates, and discuss the near-atness of this metric at the horizon, in the g2
y m n  
limit. the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the relevant laplacians are then shown to
be essentially the same as in the completely at case, with the contour of the classical
worldsheet bringing the problem into the form of an innite square well.

2

in section 4 we discuss the expansion of the action to the rst non-trivial order. it
is found that two of the transverse worldsheet coordinates become massive, and do not
contribute to the luscher term. we argue that, due to the vanishing curvature in the
g2
y m n   limit, the fermion and ghost contributions will have essentially at-space
contributions to c/l, although we do not claim to show this explicitly. this means that
the bose-fermi cancellation of the luscher term is incomplete, leaving a net contribution
of the type +c/l, with opposite sign to the one extracted from lattice monte carlo data.
we emphasize, however, that this is a rather tentative conclusion, which assumes that
there are no surprises coming from the fermion and ghost sectors.

so far these results refer to qcd in three dimensions. section 5 contains a brief
discussion of the four dimensional case. finally, in section 6, we suggest that in four
dimensions the massive world sheet elds may relate to extrinsic curvature terms in an
eective qcd string theory.

2 the saddle point eld for large interquark distances

as explained in ref. [2, 4], spatial wilson loops in d=3 planar yang-mills theory are com-
puted, in the supergravity approach, from the dynamics of worldsheets in the near-extremal
background metric

the boundary of the worldsheet is a rectangle in the x1x2 plane at u = , whose interior,
specied by x1 = , x2 =  with ||  l
2 , parametrizes the worldsheet of a
l  y wilson loop with y  l. the classical worldsheet, in the y   limit, is given
by x1(,  ) = , x2(,  ) =  , and u() determined implicitly from

the metric (1) is relevant for the calculation of the boson and fermion contributions
to the action. in general, since the background eld u = u() is a non-trivial function of
, one cannot expect that world sheet supersymmetry is preserved in the presence of this
2 , l
background eld. on the other hand, a graph of u() in the range   [ l
2 ] looks very
much like an innite square well at large l, as seen in fig. 1. starting at u( l
2 ) = , u()
drops precipitously to u()  u0  ut , remaining almost constant in a range [ l
2 d]
where d  l, and then shoots back up to u =  at  = l
2 . the fact that the classical
worldsheet coordinate u() is nearly constant for most of the range of  is, of course, very
relevant for a saddlepoint calculation, where we include the eect of gaussian uctuations
around the classical worldsheet.

figure 2: a /(l/2) versus u/u0 plot of the exact solution for bl = 30, compared to the
two asymptotic solutions. the solution valid for   l/2 approaches the exact solution
near y = 1.25, whereas the || < l/2 solution starts to deviate from the exact solution
near   0.925(l/2).

thus, for || < l/2 the corrections to y = 1 are exponentially small, and u()  u0 is
essentially constant.

for ||  l

according to eq. (9) and fig. 1, the classical solution for u() is almost constant in

a more stringent criterion, arrived at numerically, is to ask where y() deviates from
y = 1, at large l, by more than 103. with this criterion for d, we nd that d < 1.5/b,
approximately, obtained from the solutions for y() at various l shown in fig. 3.

on d by requiring that y should only deviate from 1 by 103, corresponding to the left side
of the gure, we see that 1  /(l/2) decreases like 1/l to a high accuracy, because in
going from the top to the bottom at y = 1.001, the distance between the successive curves
decreases by a factor two.

3 eigenvalues of laplacians in the ads background

we would like to make an expansion around the saddle point. in order to do this, it is
convenient to use dierent variables than u and t, because of the singular form of the
metric (1). we therefore introduce the kruskal-like coordinates for u > ut

these expressions are valid in euclidean space, and in minkowski space the sine and
cosine are replaced by the hyperbolic sine and cosine, respectively. the time variable t is
periodically identied by t  t + /b, with ut = br2. in these coordinates

so that the metric is now symmetric in terms of the new variables z and t . as usual with
the (euclidean) kruskal metric, u should be considered as a function of t 2 + z 2 through
the equation (u > ut )

the end points  = l/2.

the saddlepoint contribution to the spatial wilson loop is given by simply evaluating

(16)

we are interested now in the contribution from gaussian uctuations around the saddle-
point, which involve the bosonic, fermionic, and ghost degrees of freedom, in the limit of
very large r.

in the r   limit the curvature of the 5-sphere (as well as the curvature of ads space)
vanishes, and the contribution of each degree of freedom associated with the 5-sphere
is identical to the corresponding at-space value, i.e. y /12l. likewise, uctuations
around the classical worldsheet in ads space in the neighborhood of the horizon, i.e.
  [ l
2  d], are essentially uctuations in at space, and the relevant dierential
operators are either the at-space 2d laplacian, or, as we shall see in the next section,
this operator plus a mass term. thus, for example, the eigenstates (,  ) of

2 + d, l

will be identical to eigenstates of the at-space 2d laplacian, i.e.

in ads space the values for  are slightly dierent, owing to the fact that eq. (18) breaks

(20)

here  is a separation constant. the equation for  is the same as for the 2 operator,
whereas for the function s in the neighborhood of the endpoints there are two solutions,
namely one for which s vanishes, in   l

2 limit, as

s  const. (l/2  )5/3

(21)

and one where s goes to a non-zero constant for   l
2 . the solution vanishing at the
endpoints is the one which is relevant for worldsheet uctuations. away from the endpoints,
(,  ) has the harmonic form shown in eq. (18). the end point solution (21) vanishes
more rapidly than the sine function near  =  l
2 , which is due to the fact that in eq. (20)
the rst derivative s  is multiplied by a large factor, and hence is forced to be small.

we can now make a rough estimate of how the eigenvalues of 2

m compare to those of
the at-space operator, based on the fact that (,  ) falls much more rapidly to zero, near
the endpoints at  =  l
2 , than the sine function. this allows us to approximate (,  )
as a harmonic function in the range [ l
2  d], and equal to zero outside this range.

since the at-space eigenvalues for the massless laplacian lead to a luscher term of o(1/l),
these small deviations can only lead to a further correction, in the ads case, of still higher
order in 1/l. for the massive laplacian the situation is, however, dierent, as we shall see
in the next section.

a similar observation presumably applies to the fermionic and ghost degrees of freedom.
the associated dierential operators in ,  again only deviate from the corresponding at-
space case in a region near the endpoints, where the derivatives are multiplied by a factor of
u(); this region is a very small fraction (of order 1/l) of the full interval. eigenmodes of
these operators will have to be nearly constant in the shootup region near the endpoints,
where u()  . however, as in the case of the bosonic modes, this slight modication
of the eigenmodes will only aect the values of the determinants at higher orders in 1/l.

4 the bosonic action and the necessity of massive

elds

we want now to study the bosonic action, keeping only quadratic terms in the 8 transverse
variables (z, t, x3, ...). we start from the partition function

z = z dxg exp(cid:18) 1

(23)
where we integrate over the 10 variables x m , and insert a factor g in order to have a
measure which is invariant with respect to changes of the coordinates entering the ads5 
s5. we also want to choose a gauge where ,  are identied with x1, x2. the measure

2 z d2qdet gm n (x())ax m bx n(cid:19) ,

8

factor in (23) can then be exponentiated in the form

g = exp(cid:18)2z d2h ln g(cid:19) .

(24)
here h is the measure associated with the world sheet variables, so h = u 2/r2, and
 is a ultraviolet cuto. this form of the exponentiation is reparametrization invariant.
because of the absence of a 1/2 factor in the exponentiated version of g, this factor
will only contribute to terms of order  in the eective action. we shall not consider this
order, and we therefore ignore the g contribution in the following.

now, if we expand the action, keeping only second order terms, we get

s  (1/2)z d2nu 2/r2 + (1/2)h(u 2

t /r2)(cid:16)(iz)2 + (it )2 + (ix3)2(cid:17) + r2(iym )2io ,

(25)
where the ys refer to the 5-sphere, and where we took x1, x2 to be longitudinal. of course,
it is important to keep all second order terms. to this end, we need to notice that the u 2
in the rst term is given as a function of z, t . exactly at the horizon z = t = 0, and
z 2 + t 2 therefore represent the small, second order deviations of the radial variable from
its value at the horizon,

t /r4)(z 2 + t 2).
inserting in eq. (25), we nd to 2nd order in the uctuations

u  ut + (u 3

s  (1/2)z d2(u 2

+(u 2

t /2r2)(ix3)2) + (r2/2)(iym )2),

t /r2 + (u 2

t /r4)(z 2 + t 2)]

(26)

(27)

t /r4 = 4b2. thus two
which shows that the elds z, t have mass terms with coecients 4u 2
bosonic degrees of freedom, originally associated with the u, t coordinates, have become
massive, and it is not hard to see why such a potential term must exist: the boundary
of the worldsheet lies at u = , yet the preferred position of the string, as l  , lies
at the black hole horizon z = t = 0. the rst term in the integral gives the leading
contribution (u 2

derived in refs. [2, 4, 5].

the gaussian integral over z, t can be performed, e.g. by use of analytic regularization
[13] (ln x = x/ for   0). since y  , the sum over the time-eigenvalues can
be replaced by an integral, which can be performed to give

tr ln(2 + 4b2) = (y /4)(/)((  1/2)/())

with   0. the sum over n can be carried out and the limit   0 can be performed to

(30)

here  is an ultraviolet cuto, which occurs in the heat kernel method, which gives cuto
dependent terms proportional to 2 and b2 ln 2. the 2 terms are present for all elds,
and if we add the fermions they cancel completely. the logarithmic terms only occur for
the massive elds (see e.g. [13]), and they combine with the b2 ln(4b2) term to give the
result exhibited in (30).

using the asymptotic expansion of the bessel function valid for large l, we get

tr ln(2 + 4b2)  

y l


b2(1 + ln(4b2/2))  y b"1 +

this can be compared to the massless case,

tr ln(2) = y /12l.

(31)

(32)

it can be shown that this result follows by rewriting the sum over bessel functions in eq.
(31), by use of the following relation





k1(nz)/n = 2/6z + (1/4)cz + (1/8)z ln(z/(4)2)  z/16 + /4
xn=1

(33)

where c is eulers constant, and taking the limit b  0. the rst term on the right
hand side gives the desired result for b  0 if we take z = 4bl. for bl large, the above
expression is not useful, and the asymptotic expansion of the bessel functions should then
be used.

we have stressed, in the previous section, that curvature in ads5  s5 tends to zero in
the r   limit, and string uctuations in the neighborhood of the horizon are essentially
uctuations in a at-space metric. that being the case, how can we nd a mass term in eq.
(31) of o(b2), which is nite in the r   limit? at rst sight, this seems a violation of
the principle of equivalence. to understand what is going on, we rst note that the metric
coecients in eq. (14) are all of order r2 near the horizon. the integration in (27) runs
from l/2 to +l/2, but in fact the proper time along the horizon is of order rl. if we
make a trivial change of variables, simply rescaling all coordinates (and parameters ,  )
by a factor of r so metric coecients are all o(1) near the horizon, then the contribution
to the action from the region along the horizon is approximately

s  (b2/2)z +ry /2

(34)

10

here the mass term evidently tends to zero as r  , as one would expect from the
equivalence principle. but this decrease is precisely compensated by the growth of the
worldsheet along the horizon (as seen in the limits of integration) as r increases. the
end result of a gaussian integration is, of course, identical to eq. (31); one nds a nite,
r-independent mass term in the trace log.

for the bosonic part we thus have two massive and six massless degrees of freedom.

the contribution from the bosonic part of the string to the potential is thus

(36)

as g2
y m n  0, the curvature of ads space tends to zero. if the contributions from the
fermions and ghosts can really be obtained in the at space limit near the horizon, as
argued in the last section, then their inclusion leads to a luscher term +/12l, which is
the opposite sign to what has been observed in lattice calculations. however, the fermions
in the full ads background really need to be investigated further, before this can be
considered as a safe conclusion.

we can now compute the contribution to the potential using the results in ref [13], and
adding the leading terms (ignoring terms which are exponentially small), we get the string
tension in four dimensions by use of analytic regularization (ln x = x/ for   0)

here  is the arbitrary scale introduced in the last section.

we end this section by remarking again that the eective atness of ads space, in the
strong-coupling limit, suggests that the fermi and ghost degrees of freedom contribute to
the luscher term as in at space. if this is so, then we again have the following net result
for the luscher term

to the lattice monte carlo data, namely

(50)

thus the magnitude is the same, but the signs are opposite. since numerical determination
of the coecient of the luscher term in qcd4 is not yet very precise, further monte carlo
investigation would be welcome.

perhaps the shift of sign in (49) can be understood from the result for the bosonic

string found by alvarez [14], according to which the potential is given by

t4ql2  l2

c, lc = (d  2)/12t4.

(51)

originally this result was derived for large d, but later the result was extended to any d [15].
eq. (51) leads to (50) in the large l limit. the square root singularity below l = lc is
connected to the tachyon. the negative sign in the luscher term (50) is therefore in a
sense a reection of the fact that the bosonic string has a tachyon. perhaps the positive
sign in eq. (49) is then a reection that there is no tachyon in the (qcd) string considered
here.

6 massive elds and extrinsic curvature

one of the most interesting questions in non-perturbative gauge theory, which the ads/cft
correspondence may eventually address, concerns the form of the eective d=4 string the-
ory describing the qcd string. in this connection, we would like to make a remark that may
be relevant for the understanding of the existence of massive elds versus reparametrization
invariance.

when the 1-loop contributions of two massive and two massless worldsheet modes are
combined, one nds a result which is strongly reminiscent of string models with extrinsic
curvature [16]. the extrinsic curvature k i

ab (=the second fundamental form) is given by

dadbx = k i

abni, with nink = ik and niax = 0,

(52)

where x(,  ) is is the position vector for some surface, ni are the normals, and da is the
covariant derivative with respect to the induced metric gab = axbx. there are many
expressions for the extrinsic curvature. here we need in particular

k ia

b k ib

a = (cid:16)a(ggabbx)(cid:17)2

.

(53)

thus the extrinsic curvature is of fourth order in the derivatives.

it was noticed in ref. [13] that a perturbative expansion of the string with extrinsic
curvature leads to tr lns coming from massive elds. this can be seen by use of the

13

relation

tr ln(cid:16)2(cid:17) + tr ln(cid:16)2 + 42t 2(cid:17) = tr ln 1

where 0 = 8t t 2/27 is the string tension to leading order, and t is the t hooft
coupling g2
y m n. the left hand side of this equation combines the gaussian integrations
over four world sheet elds: the rst term on the left hand side can be taken from two
of the massless string elds, whereas the second term comes from the two massive elds.
the combined tr ln on the right hand side can be considered as coming from the eective
action1

(56)

where (55) arises from (56) by a perturbative expansion of the metric and the determinant
by use of

(57)
keeping only terms of order x 2. the xs here are 2 dimensional and transverse. in (56)
there are four xs, two of which are longitudinal, so we are looking at a four-dimensional
theory of extrinsic curvature, and an eective string of positive rigidity.2

gab = ab + axbx,

for a superstring in at space the bosonic tr lns exactly cancel the fermionic ones. in
our case, we have argued that the fermions still live in an eectively at space. hence the
total result of the gaussian integrations is

 tr ln[2] + tr ln[2 + 42t 2] = 2tr ln[2] + tr ln[(2)2 + 42t 2(2)]. (58)
the last term on the right hand side has the interpretation in terms of extrinsic curvature
discussed above, and can be formulated as in eq. (56). the rst term on the right hand
side of (58) can be considered as the contribution from fermions,

sf = constz d2(cid:20) 1

/(cid:21) .

(59)

here (,  ) and (,  ) are two-dimensional majorana spinors which are also four dimen-
sional vectors, and sf should be added to se in eq. (56). also, the boundary conditions
on  and  are that they should be of the ramond type.

1the last term in (54) can be absorbed in the constant , which is anyhow arbitrary: 2  272/t .
2in contrast, vortex tubes found in abelian higgs models appear to have negative rigidity, and may be

unstable at the quantum level [17].

14

thus, at least for qcd4, we can view the trace log contributions as arising from an
eective four dimensional string theory, which has both extrinsic curvature and worldsheet
fermions.
it is of interest that in the eective picture one does not see all the extra
dimensions. of course, these may show up in higher orders of 1/g2

y m n.

7 conclusions

we have found that two of the bosonic modes of the maldacena-witten worldsheet are
massive. these mass terms are relevant for the existence of a luscher term in the heavy
quark potential, since they tend to spoil the bose-fermi cancellation, and they may also be
related to extrinsic curvature terms in the eective qcd string. concerning the luscher
term, our very tentative conclusion is that such a term appears, and in four dimensions
it has the same magnitude, but opposite sign of the one used in ts to lattice monte
carlo data. the basis for this result is the discussion in section 3, according to which
the eigenvalues of worldsheet laplacians are essentially like those in at space, and we
also expect at space contributions from the fermions and ghosts. there may, however, be
surprises which would show up when the full boson-fermion action in the black hole ads
background becomes known.
