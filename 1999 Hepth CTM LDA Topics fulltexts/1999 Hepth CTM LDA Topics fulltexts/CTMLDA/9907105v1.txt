abstract

in this paper we investigate complex solutions of the bethe equations in
the two-particle sector both for arbitrary nite number of sites and for the
thermodynamic limit . we nd the number of complex solutions (strings)
and compare it with the string conjecture prediction. some simple properties
of these solutions like position in the spectrum, crossing of levels, connection
to the ground state and transformation to the real solutions are discussed.
counting both real and complex solutions we nd expected number of highest
weight bethe states.

i. introduction

among integrable spin chains those invariant on quantum groups have attracted consid-
erable interest. the simplest among these are su(2)q invariant chains. open chains have
been considered for spin one half [1], spin one [2] and higher spin [3]. generalisations to
other groups have been also investigated [4], [5]. closed chains have been introduced later
because parallel requirement of quantum group invariance and generalised translational in-
variance required introduction of a nonlocal term in the hamiltonian [6]. these chains were
shown to have interesting properties. su(2)q invariant closed chain has ground state with
vanishing or nonvanishing spin depending on the value of the coupling constant [7]. central
charge was found and it was shown that in particular points of the coupling constant it cor-
responds to central charge of minimal unitary series [7], [8]. its excited states and operator

content was also found [9]. recently, it was argued that this model is related to interesting
eld theories [10] and in particular to the liouville theory with imaginary coupling [11]. a
common approach to investigation of integrable models in general and of this model in par-
ticular is the bethe ansatz method [12], [13]. this method leads to a set of transcendental
equations for momenta of quasiparticles. one class of the solutions has real quasimomenta
that can be found by numerical iteration. however, there are also solutions with complex
quasimomenta. searching for the latter class of solutions one usually makes the so-called
string conjecture [14], [15]. in particular, it has been used in investigations of some quantum
invariant models [16], [17] and also in a recent investigation motivated by the relation of
such models to liouville eld theories [18]. however, it was recently pointed in the context
of xxx and xxz models that string conjecture has exceptions [1925]. that means those
solutions to bethe ansatz equations are not yet completely understood. for that reason in
this paper we investigate complex solutions for the closed quantum invariant spin chain. in
this investigation we shall not use the string conjecture.

for simplicity, we shall investigate the sector where spin is lower by two units than the
maximal spin. we shall nd the number of complex solutions for arbitrary number of sites
n. in the thermodynamic limit, this number is found to be of the order n, as expected on
the basis of the string conjecture. next correction will dier for a nite number from the
string conjecture prediction. if the coupling constant tends to the bethe point (cos   1)
in a suciently fast manner, than we shall have an innite number of exceptions to the
number predicted by the string conjecture. the model in this point coincides with the
xxx model and this is consistent with results of [22], [23]. further, we shall nd that the
energy distribution of complex solutions show simple features and that they are located in
a narrow energy band. in particular they are located on the top of the spectrum near the
antiferromagnetic point and on the bottom near the ferromagnetic point. energy levels cross
each other as coupling constant changes. there are no such crossings in the xxz model.
we also nd that solutions of the one of the two classes of bound states (strings) evolve
in real solutions in the special points for the coupling constant where we know that the
representation theory is not isomorphic to usual su(2). it will turn also that at least one
of overall ground states evolves in the string state. this happens in a region of coupling
constant where it is not more ground state.

as already anticipated we shall consider the hamiltonian

h = nq

r0 = grn 1g1

g = r1r2....rn 1

hamiltonian of the model is highly nonlocal but due to hecke algebra it is still integrable.
it can be diagonalized e.g. with the coordinate bethe ansatz method [7]. the energy

with m spins down can be written as

(1.17)

(1.18)

(1.19)

due to su(2)q symmetry one can use its representation theory to classify the states. in fact
for generic q we have the same multiplet structure as for usual su(2). however, for

qp = 1

p

integer

(1.20)

additional degeneracy occur [1], [6]. in particular representations of spins j  = j + np and
j  = p  1  j  np mix. here n is an integer. in order to get representations isomorphic to
su(2) one has to exclude also

only the remaining representations (called good representations) with

j = np  1/2.

j <

p  1
2

are isomorphic to su(2). the parameter q which is a root of unity can be written as

q = ei p
p .

(1.21)

(1.22)

(1.23)

it was shown [1] that for p = 1 the representations are unitary. we shall nd afterwards
that the points dened with (1.23) will play a role in the evolution of complex solutions into
real ones when we vary the coupling constant. let us for the moment concentrate to the
generic sector of the parameter q. due to the already mentioned property that in this case
we have the usual su(2) multiplet structure it is sucient to nd the highest weight states.
other states can be constructed [7] by application of the generator j . it is known that the
highest weight states correspond to sets of {ki}, i = 1 . . . m where the quasimomenta satisfy
(1.24)

ki 6= .
4

in fact we can identify in advance bethe numbers which lead to the non-highest weight
solutions. let us assume that for some i = l we have

kl = .

a straightforward calculation using (1.15) shows that

from bethe equation (1.16) for i = l we obtain

l,j (kl = , kj) =   2.

l =

m  1

(1.25)

(1.26)

(1.27)

the highest weight solutions will be obtained by excluding (1.27) from the choice of the
bethe numbers. the ground state for the hamiltonian (1.1) was found for the whole interval
0    . in fact, contrary to the the xxz model, the spin zero state is the ground state
only in the 
2     region. in the rest of the interval there is a subregion for each spin
where the ground state has just that particular spin. more precisely, the total spin s of the
ground state depends on the coupling constant  according to

j = 0

and

(1.28)

(1.29)

(1.30)

it also turns out that the corresponding momenta are real. the natural question arises
which role play complex solutions of bethe equations.

ii. complex solutions in two particle sector

in this section we shall investigate complex solutions of the bethe equations (1.16) with-
out assuming the string conjecture [14], [15]. for simplicity we shall work in the m = 2
sector. in that case the bethe equations (1.16) take the form

nk1 + 1,2 + (2  n) = 21,
nk2  1,2 + (2  n) = 22.

5

(2.1)
(2.2)

here we want in particular to look for complex solutions. due to reality of energy and
generalized momentum, k1 and k2 have to be complex conjugates of each other

k1 = kr + iki,
k2 = kr  iki.

we can express kr and ki by taking sum and dierence of equations (2.1) and (2.2)

kr =

1
n

[(1 + 2)  (2  n)]

inki = (1  2)  2 arctan

cos  sin(iki)

cos kr  cos  cos(iki)

.

with the help of the identity

and exponentiation of (2.6) one can obtain

arctan z =

(2.3)
(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

in the further analysis we shall call the solutions of equation (2.8) s-solutions and the so-
lutions of equation (2.9) c-solutions. the left hand sides of both equations (2.8), (2.9) are
monotonously decreasing functions so we shall have a solution for ki for any kr for which
cos kr is in the interval

s-strings :

c-strings :

0  cos kr < cos (1 
0  cos kr < cos 

2
n

),

if cos   0

(0

s-strings :

) < cos kr  0,

cos (1 
cos  < cos kr  0

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

if cos   0 ( 
2    ). further, as long as ki 6= 0, k1,2 6=  and thus this solution
represents the highest weight state. now we can proceed to nd the number of complex
solutions. as a rst step we shall consider leading order in n when the inequalities (2.10)
and (2.12) are identical. in this case, for a given coupling constant , the number of complex
solutions will depend on the number of values that kr can take. in order to have one to one
correspondence between kr and cos kr, the sum of bethe numbers can take 2n  1 dierent

6

equidistant values . the interval in kr for which there are complex solutions is 2(cid:16) 

as a result the number of the string solutions in leading order in n is

2  (cid:17).

2

(2n  1)(  2).

(2.14)

maybe we shall remark that if we insist to have kr between  and  we should not take
bethe numbers symmetrically around zero due to the term proportional to  in equation
(2.5). however, this does not aect the counting argument. to determine the number of
complex solutions more precisely, we have to take into account subleading orders in n in
relations (2.10) and (2.12). the allowed interval for the real parts of s-solutions is smaller
than the corresponding interval for c-solutions and there are no s-solutions for an interval
in kr of length

kr = 4 arcsin

cos 

n sin(cid:18) arccos cos +arccos(cos (1 2

2

n ))

.

(cid:19)

(2.15)

the number of solutions, which were overcounted in naive formula (2.14), is integer part of

n =

2n  1

cos 

n sin(cid:18) arccos cos +arccos(cos (1 2

(cid:19)

(2.16)

this correction is a nite number even in the thermodynamic limit (n  ). however, if
| cos | = 1 correction is innite and goes as n . this is true if | cos |  1 suciently fast,
more precisely if

n(1  | cos |) = const.

and  > 1.

(2.17)

this is consistent with the fact that  = 0 or  = pi corresponds to xxx chain for which is
known that this correction is innite. this correction represents at the same time a violation
of the string conjecture which was found previously in xxx [22], [23] and xxz chain [24],
[25]. disappearance of s-solutions (strings) is followed by appearance of real solution with
two close quasimomenta. these quasimomenta can be found near the number of sites where
s-string disappeared by numerical iteration of (2.1) and (2.2) with the same bethe numbers
1 and 2. real solutions of bethe equations with two identical bethe numbers also represent
violation of the string conjecture. evolution of s-strings into real solutions with identical
bethe numbers can be followed for xed coupling constant by increasing the number of sites
n. exapmle is given on fig.1 for  = 0.32.

iii. properties of complex solutions

next interesting question we would like to ask is how are complex solutions (bound
states) distributed on the energy scale. from the relations (2.9), (2.8) and (1.17) we see
that complex solutions are conned in the energy band

0 < e(c-strings)  2 cos ,
< e(s-strings)  2 cos .

8 cos 

n

(3.1)

(3.2)

the left sides of the inequalities correspond to the points (in coupling constant ) where
two complex quasimomenta collide on the real axis and the complex solution becomes real
solution (decay of the bound state). the right sides of the inequalities correspond to the
points where ki tends to innity and so the localisation of two overturned spins in bound
state tends to innity. this can be seen from the form of the bethe wave function (1.14).
the energy band (3.1) is generally narrow compared to the overall spread of energy when
all solutions are included. as an illustration of m = 2 spectrum, gures are given for
n = 6, n = 8 and n = 10 (fig.2, fig.3, fig.4). we see that all bound states (strings)
disappear near the free theory point  = 
2 . energies of the string solutions are on the
top of the spectrum near the bethe antiferromagnetic point  =  and on the bottom of
the spectrum near the bethe ferromagnetic point  = 0. there is an interesting question
connected to the nature of the overall ground state. we know that for any nite and even
n the total spin s of the ground state depends on the value of the coupling . in particular,
ground state has spin zero for 
2s . the quasimomenta
are known and they are all real. we nd that beyond these intervals there is a region of 
values where these solutions become complex. to see this feature we remind that due to the
relation m = n

2  s and (1.28) the overall ground state is in the m = 2 sector for

2     and spin s for

2(s+1)    





.

(3.3)



n  2   

n  4

in particular for n = 6, 8, 10 these intervals in coupling will be [ 
6 ] ,
respectively. following this state we see that at certain points outside the above intervals
the quasimomenta become complex. from the choice of bethe numbers (1.29) we see that
this state will become complex c-solution and the transformation of this real state into string
will happen in the e = 0 point. generally, we can nd points in coupling constant where
the complex solutions will become real. in the transition points

2 ], [ 

8 , 

4 ,

cos  = cos kr

for c-strings this is satised for

[n, ..., 2n  6, 2n  4]


2    .

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)



now we see that the state, which is the overall ground state in interval (3.3), after a change of
(n 1)(n 2) in  becomes c-string. it is interesting that the points (3.6) and (3.7) correspond
to the points (1.23) where the the representation theory is no more isomorphic to su(2)
and where several multiplets merge together forming indecomposable combinations [1]. the

n(cid:17)
points where s-strings disappear are not of this form because of the correction factor(cid:16)1  2

in (3.5).

8

crossing of energy levels of complex solutions with the change of coupling constant is one
of the features of this model that make it dierent from the xxz model. this is illustrated
on fig.5 and fig.6 on which we follow energy levels of m = 2 strings for both models and
for number of sites n = 15. the number of strings is the same in both models. however, in
xxz model there are complex solutions with kr which are degenerated. presence of a term
linear in  in equations (1.16), which can be interpreted as a coupling constant dependent
toroidal twist in xxz model, removes this degeneracy and causes crossing of energy levels.

iv. real quasimomenta and completeness of solutions to

bethe equations

now we want to enumerate all real solutions of bethe equations in two-particle sector.
we start again from equations (2.1) and (2.2). after manipulating their dierence and sum
we obtain the following equations for k = k1 + k2 and k1  k2

k

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

we have to notice that not all 2n  1 dierent values of i = 1 + 2 give dierent
solutions. changing i by n is equivalent to changing one quasimomentum by 2 which
results in change of sign of right hand sides of (4.2) and (4.3). this reduces the number of
possible values of i to n, which in turn can be chosen to give positive values of right hand
sides of (4.2) and (4.3). the left hand sides of the equations (4.2) and (4.3) are periodic
functions. thus in principle, for each of n dierent xed values of the right hand side
one can count number of solutions by counting number of intersections. these periodic
functions are given on fig.7 for n = 9 and n = 10. for n odd we nd that the number of
intersections is

the number of complex solutions is just equal to the second  function in the expressions
above. if we take into account that for n even there are n

for n odd n 1

v. conclusion

in this paper we have investigated complex solutions of the bethe equations for the m = 2
sector of the su(2)q invariant closed spin chain for arbitrary number of sites and coupling
constant. we nd that some properties of these solutions are similar to the properties of
complex solutions for the normal xxz chain and some of them are not. in particular we nd
the number of complex solutions both for nite n and in thermodynamic limit. this number
diers from the number predicted by the string conjecture for a nite number of solutions.
however, if   0 suciently fast compared to 1
n , the number of exceptions becomes
innite and goes as n. these properties are essentially the same as in the case of xxz
chain. one can follow evolution of string solutions and their disappearance with decreasing
coupling strength | cos |. one class of strings (c-strings) disappears in points where the
representation of the su(2)q is no more isomorphic to su(2). by increasing number of
sites for xed coupling constant, strings of the other class turn into real quasimomenta that
can be found by iterating bethe equations with two identical bethe numbers. this is again
violation of the string conjecture. the overall ground state, which is always real, is in the
m = 2 sector for coupling constant
n 4 . this state becomes complex solution
for   
n 1. the energy dependence of string solutions shows some simple features. the
strings are found in a narrow energy band and are located on the top of the spectrum near
the antiferromagnetic point and on the bottom near the ferromagnetic point. their energy
levels cross each other with the change of coupling constant, which is not the case for the
xxz chain. finally, we nd the number of real solutions. the number of all solutions of the

n 2    



2(cid:17). among these we identify n non-highest weight states. that leads

bethe equations is (cid:16)n
to the (cid:16)n

1(cid:17) highest weight bethe states.

fig. 1. this gure shows dependence of real part of complex s-solutions on numbers of sites
n for  = 0.32. it clearly illustrates transmutation of one complex solution in real solution (two
quasimomenta) for a given critical n . these two real quasimomenta correspond to same bethe
numbers and are obtained by numerical iteration of equations (2.1) and (2.2).

fig. 2. spectrum of m = 2 sector for n = 6. energies of both real and complex solutions of

the bethe equations are plotted.

fig. 3. same as fig. 2 but for n = 8.

fig. 4. same as fig. 2 but for n = 10.

fig. 5. dependence of energies of complex solutions for su (2)q invariant spin chain and num-

ber of sites n = 15 on coupling constant .

fig. 6. dependence of energies of complex solutions for xxz spin chain and number of sites

n = 15 on coupling constant , which corresponds to cos .

fig. 7. left hand sides of equations (4.2) and (4.3) as a functions of k1  k2 for n = 9 and

n = 10.
