we give a cosmological spinning multi-black-hole solution in the einstein-maxwell-
dilaton-axion theory with a positive cosmological constant. this solution is the cosmological
dilatonic israel-wilson-perjes solution and describes the collision of several spinning black-
holes.

a cosmological multi-black hole solution has been discovered by kastor and
traschen 1)(kt solution) in the einstein-maxwell theory with a positive cosmological
constant (em-). the solution describes collisions of several black holes(bhs) in
asymptotically desitter space-times.
it is worth noting that the solution is the
rst exact solution such that describes bh-bh collision. it also provides the test
of the cosmic censorship 2), 3) and cosmic no-hair conjectures 4) in the inationary
universe 5).

one may be greatly interested in the spinning version of the kt solution because
the rotating cases are generic. apart from the cosmological cases, the spinning
multi-soliton solution was found by israel & wilson 6) and perjes 7)(iwp solution) in
asymptotically at space-times. unfortunately, the solution has naked singularities
due to the force balance condition q = m . on the other hand, we can expect that
there are cases without singularities in asymptotically desitter space-times even if
q = m . this expectation relies on the causal structure of the single kerr-newman-
desitter space-time. so we can obtain the physical advantage of the cosmological
version because of no singularity.

the existence of the spinning multi-soliton solution is deeply related to the force
balance up to the gravitational spin-spin interaction. the force cancellation has been
conrmed for the iwp solution 8). the present author and gen also showed that
the force cancellation holds between a probe particle and the kerr-newman-desitter
space-time 9). this observation strongly encourages us to nd a new cosmological
spinning multi-black-hole solution, that is, the spinning version of the kt solution.
in this letter, however, we will give an exact solution in the four dimensional
einstein-maxwell-dilaton-axion(emda) theory with a positive (emda-) which
describes a low energy string theory except for a positive . the construction of

the solution is motivated by the chiral null model 10) in ve dimensions. in the four
dimensional emda theory without the cosmological constant, there is the dilatonic
iwp solution 11) where the force cancellation holds 12). via a certain dimensional
reduction the solution turns out to be embedded into the chiral null model in ve
dimensions 10). therefore we realise that it is better that we think of an exact solution
in ve dimensions and we are bearing the chiral null model spirit in mind. by virtue
of the spirit, it is more easy to handle the emda- theory than the em- theory.

in the einstein frame the action of the four dimensional emda- theory is

where , f and h are the dilaton, eld strength of the electromagnetic and
three form tensor elds, respectively. in this paper,  is assumed to be a positive
constant.

firstly, we give the expression of the exact solution without the explanation of

the derivation. the metric g , vector potential a and the three form h are

g dxdx = a2(cid:20)f (d + idxi)2 + f 1ijdxidxj(cid:21)

and the relation between i and the above harmonic function  is given by

ijkjk = i.

where h0 := /2. this solution apparently induces the non-cosmological dila-

tonic iwp solution 11) in the limit of h0 = 0. it also does the non-rotating dilatonic
kt solution 13), 14) in the limit of ni = 0 and the real xi.

we can directly check that eqs. (2)(9) satisfy the eld equations derived from
the action of eq. (1). however, as we said, our construction is inspired by the chiral
null model in ve dimensions. so we will guide our trace here. the action(eq. (1))
can be obtained from the ve dimensional theory as follows. the ve dimensional
low energy string action is given by

s5 = z d5x

g(cid:20)rg + 4m m

h 2  (cid:21)e2,

(10)

where m = y, 0, 1, 2, 3, h 2 = hij kh ij k and hij k = 3[i bj k]. in the kaluza-
klein-like manner as

gm n dxm dxn = (dy + 2adx)2 + g dxdx,

we obtain the four dimensional action

s4 = z d4xpg(cid:20) r + 4g

g gff  (cid:21)e2,

(11)

(12)

where f = aa, h = 3[b] +24a[a] and we assumed that all of
elds do not depend on the coordinate y. finally, rewriting the action in the einstein
frame where we can move to there by the conformal transformation, g = e2g ,
we obtain the action of eq. (1).

inspired by the chiral null mode, we can set

g dxdx = f 2(d + idxi)2 + ijdxidxj

a =

in fact, in a certain case, the chiral null model form of the lagrangian for the string
theory becomes 10)

l = f u[v + f 1u + 2ixi] + xixi

where  = + and  = . from the rst to the second and third line, we set u = y
and v = 2 . here i is assumed to satisfy ijkjk = i, where  a harmonic
function. since we are considering the system with a positive cosmological constant
and this system is not exactly string theory, we remind readers that the chiral null
model gives just reference to manage the problem. in the actual chiral null model
f does not depend on the coordinates y and  . on the other hand, f does on 
in the present study. comparing the second line of eq. (17) with the string action,
l = (gm n + bm n )xm x n , we see that eqs. (13), (14), (15) and (16) together
with eq. (11) are plausible arranging.

using eqs. (11) and (13), the ve dimensional metric of eq. (11) becomes

gm n dxm dxn = dy2 + 2f dyd + 2f idydxi + ijdxidxj.

from eq. (26) we can see that f 1 is a harmonic function. eqs. (25) (27) have the
solution with eqs. (5) and (6). we can check in straightforward way that eqs. (5)
and (6)satisfy the rest equations (20) and (22). as a result, we obtain the solution
of eqs.(2)(9) in the einstein frame.
in the same way as the non-rotating dilatonic kt solution 13), we can see that
the solution given by us here, the rotating dilatonic kt solution, has the timelike
singularities which surrounds solitons. this is the reason why we say dashed black
hole in the title and the abstract of this paper. rigorously speaking, the solution
does not describe black holes. however, this type might be interpreted as a non-
singular solution in a higher dimensions as gibbons, horowitz and townsend have
done 15).

in this letter, for simplicity, we considered the emda- theory where we can
be bearing the chiral null model spirit in mind. and now we could nd the spinning
version of the dilatonic kt solution. thus, we surely expect that the spinning
non-dilatonic solution exists as well as our present solution. we may think that
the spinning version of the kt solution in the em- theory is free from naked
singularities because the kt solution in the pure einstein-maxwell theory is like that.
aided the study of the force balance up to the gravitational spin-spin interaction 9),
we think that the present work can encourage us to nd a spinning version of the
kt solution in the em- theory. hopefully, we would like to discover the exact
solution in near future. at the same time, the comprehensive features such as the
global structure and the symmetry like supersymmetry should be reported together
with the features of the present rotating dilatonic kt solution if there is.
