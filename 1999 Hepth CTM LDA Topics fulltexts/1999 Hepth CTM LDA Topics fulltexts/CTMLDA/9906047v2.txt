abstract

we initiate a study of cosmology within the framework of maldacenas
ads/cft correspondence. we present a comprehensive analysis of the clas-
sical motion of a charged domain wall that separates an external reissner-
nordstrm region of spacetime (with small or vanishing cosmological con-
stant) from an internal de-sitter region. the possible associated spacetime
diagrams are drawn, although in the classical case, an unambiguous predic-
tion of what occurs at late times in the interior region is not possible, since
singularities and cauchy horizons form. we argue that, when the asymptotic
region is anti-de sitter, the ads/cft correspondence gives a prescription
for resolving the curvature singularities and evolving solutions across the ex-
pected cauchy horizon. some of our solutions contain inating interiors, and
we provide evidence these can be patched onto solutions with smooth ini-
tial data, circumventing an obstacle found by farhi and guth to creating an
inating universe in the laboratory.

i. introduction

the conjectured correspondence between large n superconformal eld theories and string

theory in anti-de sitter backgrounds [1], provides us with a possible nonperturbative deni-

tion of string theory. the formulation is background dependent, since one is always left with

the restriction that the geometry is asymptotically anti-de sitter space. nevertheless it is

possible to use this framework to address some of the longstanding questions in cosmology

by considering processes where a black hole forms with an interior resembling a realistic

cosmological model.

in this paper we take a rst step in this direction. we perform a comprehensive analysis

of the motion of a charged domain wall that separates an external reissner-nordstrm

region of spacetime (with small or vanishing cosmological constant) from an internal de-

sitter region. our analysis rests on the discontinuity equations of israel [2] and kuchar [3],

and is very much in the spirit of that carried out by blau, guendelman and guth, for the

case in which the external metric is schwarzschild [4] (see also [5]), and by boulware [6], for

the case in which the internal metric is minkowski.

in the present study, with a charged shell, there exists a much richer spectrum of pos-

sibilities for the dynamics of the collapsing shell. we avoid an obstacle encountered in [7]

that initial conditions are necessarily singular. we present all possible allowed dynamics for

the shell in four dimensions. in the situation considered here, it is impossible to predict,

without imposing additional boundary conditions, the ultimate outcome of the interior re-

gion of such a composite spacetime [7], since the singularity theorems of general relativity

predict a singularity to the past of the core region.

however, this lack of predictability can be dealt with by appealing to the ads/cft

correspondence. taking the point of view that this conjecture is correct, it becomes pos-

sible to resolve the singularities that appear and unambiguously determine the dynamics.

thus, we discuss the gravitational systems explored here in the framework of the ads/cft

correspondence.

this study also addresses a number of issues important for topological ination [8], where

super-heavy magnetic monopoles are argued to provide the seeds for ination. in addition,

when solitons of various dierent topological charge are present in one theory [9], it has been

suggested that monopole collisions could give rise to inating core regions [10]. the lack of

predictability at the classical level mentioned above is a severe obstacle in these approaches.

1

the structure of the paper is as follows.

in the next section we derive the equations

of motion of our charged shell.

in section iii we then discuss the possible solutions to

these equations, and present the trajectories on penrose diagrams. finally, in section iv

we discuss the bubble solutions using the ads/cft correspondence and comment on their

interpretation at the quantum level.

ii. equations of motion

consider a spherical domain wall in n + 1 spacetime dimensions which separates an

interior region of spacetime from an exterior region, described respectively by the static

metrics, in spherical polar coordinates (r, ),

ds2 = fin(out) (r) dt2 + f 1

in(out) (r) dr2 + r2 d2

n1 .

(2.1)

in particular we will examine the case where the internal region is in a false vacuum state

described by de sitter metric

fin = 1  2r2 ,

and the external is described by reissner-nordstrm-anti de sitter (r-n) metric

fout = 1 

2m
rn2 +

q2
r2n4 + r2 ,

(2.2)

(2.3)

where m is the schwarzschild parameter, q the charge, and  the absolute value of the

cosmological constant. further, we will only consider the case q  m, to preserve the

horizon structure of the r-n black hole, and  much less than any other parameter, to

ensure a relevant contribution only in the asymptotic region r  .

we will parameterize the radius r of the shell by the proper time  measured by an

observer comoving with the shell. the equations of motion are referred to as junction

equations [2], and in our parameterization reduce to

sinqfin + r2  soutqfout + r2 = kr ,

(2.4)

where k is proportional to the tension of the wall, sin (out) = 1, and a dot represents a

derivative with respect to proper time. squaring (2.4) twice, we obtain

r2 + v (r) = 1 ,

(2.5)

2

which is the equation for the one dimensional motion of a particle in a potential

v (r) = 2r2 

1

4k2r2 "(k2  2  )r2 +

.

(2.6)

it can be shown that in regions where r is a spacelike coordinate sin(out) are positive if the

outward normal to the wall is pointing towards increasing radii (see [6]), and negative if the

normal points towards decreasing radii. if we use kruskal-szekeres style coordinates (u, v)

we nd that sin(out) determine also whether the angle arctan(v/u) increases or decreases

as we move along the trajectory (see [4]). for the external metric the kruskal-szekeres

coordinates have a rather complicated relationship with r and t. for deniteness we give

the explicit relations for n = 3,  = 0 in region i (u > 0, u > |v|) when the formulas are

still reasonably simple

where we have dened

u = er cosh(t) ,

v = er sinh(t) ,

r = r +

(2.7)

(2.8)

and where r+ and r denote the positions of the outer and inner event horizons of the r-n

geometry respectively. sout = +1 implies arctan(v/u) increases along the trajectory, while

sout = 1 implies the angle decreases. for the internal de sitter metric, the kruskal-szekeres

style coordinates in region i (u > 0, u > |v|) are

u =   1  r

1 + r!1/2

cosh(t) ,

v =   1  r

1 + r!1/2

sinh(t) .

(2.9)

in this case, sin = +1 implies arctan(v/u) decreases along the trajectory, while sin = 1

implies the angle increases. we now use these relationships to determine the regions of the

penrose diagrams of the internal and external spaces in which the wall evolves.

to begin, (2.4) yields

and

sin = +1  fin  fout + k2r2 > 0 ,

sout = +1  fin  fout  k2r2 > 0 .

these lead to the relations

3

(2.10)

(2.11)

sout = +1  sin = +1

sin = 1  sout = 1 .

for convenience, dene the following two functions:

p (r)  (2 +  + k2)r2n2  2mrn2 + q2

n(r)  (2 +   k2)r2n2  2mrn2 + q2 ,

with asymptotic behaviors

p (r) = q2 ,

lim
r0

lim
r

p (r) = + ,

and

n(r) = q2 ,

lim
r0

lim
r

n(r) = sign(2 +   k2)  .

first focus on p (r). substituting (2.2), (2.3) in (2.11) we obtain

sout = +1  p (r) < 0 .

however, dp/dr = 0 at only one point, r = rout, with

rout = "

m(n  2)

(n  1)(2 +  + k2)#1/n

,

and hence there are two possibilities for the behavior of sout:

p (rout) > 0  sout = 1 ,

for all r, or

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

p (rout) < 0  


sout = +1

sout = 1

r(1)
out < r < r(2)
r < r(1)
out

out

, r > r(2)
out

,

(2.18)

where r(1)

out and r(2)

out are the real solutions of p (r) = 0.

now we turn to n(r). substituting (2.2) and (2.3) in (2.10) we obtain

sin = +1  n(r) < 0 .

(2.19)

because of (2.14), there are more possibilities for sin than for sout. if 2 +   k2 < 0, then
dn/dr < 0 for all r. in this case

4

sin = +1  r > rin

sin = 1  r < rin ,

(2.20)

where rin is the single solution of n(r) = 0. however, if 2 +   k2 > 0 then dn/dr = 0
at only one point, r = rin, with

rin = "

m(n  2)

(n  1)(2 +   k2)#1/n

,

and the corresponding possibilities for the behavior of sin are

n(rin) > 0  sin = 1 ,

for all r, or

n(rin) < 0  


sin = 1

sin = +1

, r > r(2)
in

r < r(1)
in
r(1)
in < r < r(2)

in

where r(1)

in and r(2)

in are the real solutions of n(r) = 0.

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

the possibilities enumerated above for the behavior of the sign parameters sin and sout,

are precisely what we need to perform an analysis of the trajectories of our charged domain

wall.

iii. trajectories

we will describe the trajectories of the spherically symmetric charged walls using penrose

diagrams. to keep things simple, we will present diagrams for the familiar asymptotically

at case. the features of the trajectories we consider will be essentially the same in asymp-

totically anti-de sitter space. the wall traces out a set of points in a reissner-nordstrm

manifold from the point of view of an external observer, and a complementary set of points in

a de sitter manifold from the point of view of an internal observer. these trajectories will be

represented on pairs of penrose diagrams describing the external and internal spaces. for ref-

erence when doing this, and to orient ourselves, we provide the separate reissner-nordstrm

and de sitter penrose diagrams in fig. (1). note the reissner-nordstrm spacetime con-

tains timelike singularities and a cauchy horizon, which implies the classical evolution of the

shell is not predictable, without additional boundary conditions. for the moment, we will

simply x the additional boundary conditions by requiring analyticity of the metric outside

the shell, and will comment further on this choice later.

times.

from the discussion of the previous section, it is evident that for a classically allowed

trajectory, the zeros of n(r), rin must satisfy

rin > rh  1/ .

(3.1)

by considering the physically allowed behavior of the outward pointing normal vector of the

shell, one nds the zeros of p (r), rout satisfy

r < rout < r+ .

(3.2)

now, the time evolution of the shell is completely determined by equation (2.5) and

equations (2.10,2.11). the rst of these equations determines the global properties of the

trajectory; in particular whether there exist any inversion points. in addition, equations

(2.10,2.11) for sin and sout determine in which regions of the separate penrose diagrams fig.

(1) the trajectory develops. we will consider only the cases in which the trajectory starts

from zero or innite radius.

what are the general features of the trajectories? first note that equation (2.13) implies

that the trajectory must begin and end in the regions i or iii of the r-n penrose diagram,

while eq. (2.14) tells us that for r < rh it must be in the right part of the de sitter penrose

diagram.

6

since the equations that determine the turning points of the trajectories are high order

polynomial equations, it is necessary to solve numerically for the turning points to determine

their position relative to the other features of the trajectory, to check that the trajectory

is physically consistent. in the remainder of this section we will focus on the case of four

spacetime dimensions (n = 3), in which the wall is a two dimensional shell and work out all

the possible trajectories. we have checked that all these trajectories may be realized also

when n = 4, but will not attempt to check this for general n.

let us rst consider the case in which

v (r) < 1 ,

(3.3)

for all values of r, so that there are no inversion points, and in particular let us focus on the

case in which the shell starts from zero radius and expands to innity. we will call these

growing trajectories.

in this situation there are 5 possible trajectories depending on the values of m, q, , k.

1. 2 +  > k2 ; n(rin) > 0 p (rout) > 0

in this case sin = sout = 1 during the whole evolution.

in the de sitter diagram the shell starts in the right-hand patch with an outward

normal pointing towards decreasing radii, and reaches innite radius keeping always an

increasing angle. in the r-n diagram the trajectory starts in a iii region (sout = 1

so that the outward normal points towards decreasing radii) then crosses r and evolves

with a decreasing angle to end in a i region at innity.

this behavior is summarized by the penrose diagrams in square a1 of fig. (2).

2. 2 +  < k2 ; p (rout) > 0

in this case sin changes sign once, at r = rin, while sout = 1 for the whole trajectory.

in the de sitter diagram the shell starts on the right patch with zero radius and

evolves with an increasing angle until it reaches rin turning then to the right. in the

r-n diagram the shell has the same behavior as in the preceding case.

this behavior is summarized by the penrose diagrams in square a2 of fig. (2).

7

3. 2 +  > k2 , n(rin) < 0 ; p (rout) > 0

in this case sin changes twice, at r(1)
in , while sout never changes. in the de
sitter diagram the evolution is the same as the previous trajectory until the rst turn
at r(1)
in which lead the shell towards the left.
the behavior in the r-n diagram is the same as in the previous case.

in which is followed by a second turn at r(2)

in and at r(2)

this behavior is summarized by the penrose diagrams in square a3 of fig. (2).

4. 2 +  > k2 , n(rin) < 0 ; p (rout) < 0

in and r(2)

in and sout changes at r(1)

out and r(2)

in this case sin changes at r(1)
out. the behavior
in the de sitter digram is the same as the preceding case. in the r-n diagram the
trajectory starts in the iii region, crosses r, turn to the right at r(1)
as it reaches r(2)

out, to end in the i region at innite radius.

out and to the left

this behavior is summarized by the penrose diagrams in square b3 of fig. (2).

5. 2 +  < k2 ; p (rout) < 0

in this case sin changes one time and sout twice. the behavior is of the same kind as
case (2) in de sitter diagram and as the previous case in the r-n spacetime.

this behavior is summarized by the penrose diagrams in square b2 of fig. (2).

let us now consider the possible trajectories that start at an innite radius and collapse

to zero, and for which (3.3) still holds. once again there are 5 dierent possible trajectories,

one corresponding to each of those above.

the common features for these trajectories are that in the de sitter diagram the trajec-

tories end in the right hand patch with an outward normal pointing towards decreasing radii

while in the r-n diagram the trajectory starts in a i region and ends in a iii region.

1. 2 +  > k2 ; n(rin) > 0 p (rout) > 0

in the de sitter diagram the shell starts from innite radius with an increasing angle

(sin = 1) and ends in the right patch with an outward normal pointing towards
in the r-n diagram the trajectory starts from a i region and
decreasing radius.

ends in the iii region without any turning point, since sout = 1 throughout the
evolution. this is shown by the penrose diagrams in square a1 of fig. (3).

2. 2 +  < k2 ; p (rout) > 0

in the de sitter diagram the shell starts at innity with decreasing angle, turns at rin

and ends in the right patch. in the r-n diagram the shell behaves as in the previous

case having sout = 1 for the whole evolution. this is shown by the penrose diagrams

in square a2 of fig. (3).

3. 2 +  > k2 , n(rin) < 0 ; p (rout) > 0

in the de sitter diagram the shell starts at innity with decreasing angle, turns at r(1)
in
and r(2)
in to end in the right patch. in the r-n diagram the behavior is the same as in

the previous case. this is shown by the penrose diagrams in square a3 of fig. (3).

4. 2 +  > k2 , n(rin) < 0 ; p (rout) < 0

in the de sitter diagram the trajectory has the same features as in the previous case.

in the r-n diagram the shell starts at innity in a i region, crosses r+ and has two
turning points at r(1)

out to end in a iii region.

out and r(2)

this is shown by the penrose diagrams in square b3 of fig. (3).

5. 2 +  < k2 ; p (rout) < 0

in the de sitter diagram the shell starts at innity with decreasing radius, turns at rin

and reaches the origin in the right patch. in the r-n diagram the shell behaves as in

the previous case. this is shown by the penrose diagrams in square b2 of fig. (3).

we now turn to cases in which there exists some value of r at which v (r) > 1, so that

there are inversion points in the trajectory.

for a growing trajectory (starting from zero radius), the shell cannot cross either the de

sitter horizon rh or the inner r-n horizon r. thus,

rmax < r

rmax < rh ,

(3.4)

and the behavior is represented in fig. (4).

things are more complicated for collapsing trajectories (starting from innite radius).

we will distinguish dierent behaviors by the position of the minimum radius with respect

to the horizons and by the changes in sin and sout, so we will describe separately the behavior
in the de sitter and in the r-n spacetimes, checking then which of these trajectories can be

consistently glued together.

for trajectories with rmin < r it is impossible to glue consistent with eq. (2.12) the

trajectories a, c and e in the de sitter diagram with the 2 in the r-n. nor can the a

trajectory in the de sitter diagram be glued with with the 3 trajectory in r-n. all the other

congurations are possible and have been realized numerically.

the only trajectories remaining are those with rmin > r+. in the r-n conformal diagram

they will always stay in the i region as we show in fig. (6). this can be glued consistently

with the a, b, and d trajectories in the de sitter spacetime.

the bubble solutions we have described in this section contain timelike singularities. it is

interesting to consider whether these solutions could be patched onto solutions with smooth

initial data, removing the past timelike singularities. physically, this would correspond to

the ability to build a machine that would be capable of producing a black hole with an

inating interior.

uncharged collapsing shells have previously been considered in [4]. the problem encoun-

tered there was that whenever the bubble grew suciently large, anti-trapped regions would

necessarily appear [7]. by the penrose singularity theorem this implies a past directed null

geodesic must be incomplete [7]. this amounts to the condition that initial conditions must

be singular.

similar solutions have been considered in the context of colliding monopoles in [10].

there a way of circumventing the problem of singular initial data was suggested. a timelike

15

singularity would form behind an event horizon, and the anti-trapped regions that must

necessarily form, would be to the future of this timelike singularity. in this way, the penrose

theorem is satised, and it can be possible to realize this solution with smooth initial data.

this is exactly the state of aairs in the collapse and bounce bubble solutions we have

constructed. in principle, therefore, it should be possible to patch these bubble solutions

onto smooth initial data. however, another obstacle encountered in [10] was that classically

it is not possible to evolve the solutions past the timelike singularity without specifying

additional boundary conditions on the singularity. in the next section, we describe how this

problem is solved for analogous asymptotically anti-de sitter bubble solutions by appealing

to the duality between gravity in ads backgrounds and large n conformal eld theory.

iv. ads/cft interpretation

in principle, the correspondence between gravity in an anti-de sitter background and con-

formal eld theory on the boundary [1], allows us to map any process in the gravity theory to

a statement in the eld theory. the duality is conjectured to hold for any spacetime dimen-

sion bigger than 2 (on the gravity side). the simplest case to consider is ve-dimensional

supergravity in an ads background which is dual to four-dimensional su(n) yang-mills

theory with 4 supersymmetries. the radius of curvature r of ads and the string coupling

gs are related to parameters in the yang-mills theory by

r = (g2

y m n)1/4 ,

gs = g2

y m .

(4.1)

the large n limit, with r xed, will correspond to the classical limit of the supergravity

theory. for other dimensions, the cft is an exotic superconformal eld theory which is

dicult to describe explicitly. the important point for us is that evolution in the cft is

unitary, which allows us to describe, in a completely well-dened way, processes in gravity

which lead to classical singularities.

the bubble solutions we have discussed, and ones previously found [4], carry over to

backgrounds where the asymptotically at backgrounds are replaced by asymptotically anti-

de sitter backgrounds. furthermore they can be generalized to general spacetime dimensions

(the relevant black hole solutions may be found in [11].) the qualitative properties of the

trajectories will not change provided r is not taken to be too small relative to the other

parameters. we will take the point of view that the correspondence between gravity and

16

conformal eld theory is valid, and discuss what these solutions must correspond to from

the cft point of view.

the ads/cft conjecture is most precisely formulated in euclidean space [12]. we

will follow the procedure discussed in [13], to obtain a denition of the lorentzian gravity

theory. the logic is as follows: the conjecture asserts that all observables in the euclidean

gravity theory can be computed in terms of gauge invariant observables in the euclidean

gauge theory. in particular, we assume this gives us enough information to construct the

metric in the gravity theory (modulo coordinate transformations), for any given process in

the gauge theory. the lorentzian gauge theory is dened by the usual wick rotation from

imaginary time in the correlation functions, which leads to a denition for the observables

in the lorentzian gravity theory in terms of a wick rotation of the euclidean observables.

reissner-nordstrom black holes have been previously considered in the ads/cft context

by chamblin, emparan, johnson and myers [11].

in terms of the cft, the black hole

microstates correspond to a nite temperature plasma of charge associated with a u(1)

subgroup of the global r-symmetry.

let us consider the interpretation of the bubble trajectories in terms of the large n

cft. a bubble in region i far from the event horizon will correspond to a charged shell

in cft. the description of analogous neutral shells in the ads/cft correspondence has

recently been studied by [14,15]. for spherically symmetric shells, the radial position is

encoded in non-local correlations in the cft state. for the cases of most interest for us,

the allowed collapse and bounce trajectories of the charged bubbles are always behind the

event horizon of a black hole from the point of view of an outside observer. these solutions

therefore correspond to particular black hole microstates from the point of view of an outside

observer. thus in the cft description, the bubbles correspond to particular microstates

in the nite temperature plasma associated with ads reissner-nordstrom black holes. it is

dicult to describe these states explicitly without more direct control over calculations in

the strongly coupled gauge theory. if it is possible to indeed patch the bubble solutions onto

congurations with smooth initial data, it would be much more straightforward to map this

into initial data in the cft, using the current understanding of the mapping between states

in the cft to states in the gravity theory [12].

the interior of the domain wall is de sitter space. in order for this to be a solution of

the gravity theory, we suppose that appropriate perturbations are turned on in the cft to

lead to a phase with broken supersymmetry inside the domain wall. a non-trivial potential

17

may then be generated for one of the scalars in the gravity theory, allowing it to act as an

inaton eld, generating a non-trivial vacuum energy in this region.

it is possible to construct a unitary time evolution operator which evolves states across

the event horizon and through the singularity by combining the usual eld theory time

translation operator with the conformal generators. in the case of a neutral black hole in

ads3 this construction has been made explicit [16]. thus the cft description resolves

the classical singularity of the black hole geometry and leads to a prescription for evolving

gravity solutions to the future of timelike singularities. the cft implies denite boundary

conditions on the timelike singularities which in general will depend on the initial state. in

the large n limit, and for suciently large bubbles, it should be possible to make these

conditions arbitrary by an appropriate choice of the cft initial state. this follows from the

fact that an arbitrary conguration in the gravity theory can be mapped to a conguration

in the cft. the bubble solutions described here correspond to boundary conditions xed

by analyticity of the metric.

finite n corrections in the cft correspond to quantum corrections from the gravity

point of view. black holes will be unstable at the quantum level due to hawking radiation.

the supergravity theory contains charged, light elds, hence the hawking radiation will tend

to discharge the black hole [17]. in line with the discussion of black hole complementarity in

ads/cft of [13], the cft implies the following picture for the quantum evolution of the

bubble in the gravity theory. the gravity variables inside and outside the event horizon are

redundant. outside the horizon, the nal state will be a set of light outgoing quanta which

carry all the information about processes inside the black hole event horizon. this will now

be a complicated time dependent state from the cft viewpoint. the degrees of freedom

inside the horizon, including those describing the eternally inating region, are encoded in

the same eld theory degrees of freedom that describe physics outside.

note the most interesting bubble solutions contain eternally inating regions. the de-

scription of these solutions in terms of the cft implies that even though we have a large

(and increasing) proper volume inside the bubble, only a nite number of states can exist

in this region. the bekenstein-hawking entropy of the black hole is nite, and will bound

the number of eld theory microstates corresponding to such congurations.

the picture of the quantum evolution of the bubble described above alleviates another

problem with the classical solution we have thus far not addressed. a cauchy horizon is clas-

sically unstable to small perturbations, which grow producing weak curvature singularities

18

in the vicinity of the cauchy horizon [18,19]. a free-falling observer crossing the cauchy

horizon sees the entire history of the external universe in the moments prior to crossing.

the picture of the quantum evolution of our solutions we have discussed above solves this

problem. the black hole evaporates in a nite time, which avoids the problem of an ob-

server inside seeing the entire history of the external universe. furthermore, because the

cft description gives a resolution of the classical singularity of the black hole, the cauchy

horizon is no longer present quantum mechanically.

what is less clear is precisely how this singularity is resolved. one possibility is that a

spacelike region of strong curvature forms outside the would-be cauchy horizon, the system

behaves in the same way as a schwarzschild black hole, and the tunnel to the inating

region collapses. another possibility is that the curvature remains nite in the vicinity of

the inner horizon, and we do indeed have an eternally inating region inside the bubble. we

propose, at least for special choices of initial conditions, that the second option is viable. it

seems likely that the constraints on these initial conditions are very strong, and it would be

interesting to study further the experimental feasibility of creating an inating universe in

the laboratory.
