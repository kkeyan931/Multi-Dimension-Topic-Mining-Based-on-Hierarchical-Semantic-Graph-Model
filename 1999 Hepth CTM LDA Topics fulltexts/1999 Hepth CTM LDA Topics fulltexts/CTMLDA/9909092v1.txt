we consider null bosonic p-branes moving in curved space-times. some exact solu-
tions of the classical equations of motion and of the constraints for the null string and
the null membrane in demianski-newman background are found.

1 introduction

the null p-branes are the zero tension limit of the usual p-branes, the 1-brane
being a string. this relationship between them may be regarded as a generalization of
the correspondence between massless and massive particles. on the other hand, the
characteristic scale of string theory is given by the string tension t = (2)1. then
one may view the high energy limit of string theory as a zero tension limit, since only
the energy measured in string units, e/t 1/2, is relevant.

the investigations in the domain of classical and quantum string propagation in
curved space-times are relevant for the quantum gravity as well as for the understanding
of the cosmic string models in cosmology. as we have already mentioned, strings are
characterized by an energy scale t 1/2 and the length of the string scales like 1/t 1/2.
the gravitational eld provides another length scale, the curvature radius of the space-
time rc. for a string moving in a gravitational eld an appropriate parameter is the
dimensionless constant c = rct 1/2. large values of c imply weak gravitational eld.
one may reach large values of c by letting t  . in this limit the string shrinks to
a point. in the opposite limit, small values of c, one encounters strong gravitational
elds and it is appropriate to consider t  0, i.e. null or tensionless strings.
the motion of classical null bosonic strings in curved backgrounds have been consid-
ered recently in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. the dynamics of null p-branes living in friedmann-
robertson-walker space-time with at space-like section (k = 0) have been investigated
in [8].

in this letter we describe the classical evolution of the null strings and membranes
in demianski-newman background [9]. in sec. 2 we begin with the general case of
tensionless p-branes moving in d-dimensional curved space-times. in sec. 3 we obtain
some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints for the null
string (p = 1) and the null membrane (p = 2) in the above mentioned background.
sec. 4 is devoted to our concluding remarks.

2 null p-branes in curved background

to begin with, let us write down one of the possible actions for the null bosonic

p-brane living in a d-dimensional curved space-time with metric tensor g(x):

s = z dp+1l

j = /j

,

l = v j v kj xkxg(x),
j = ( 0, j) = (, j),

,

(1)

j, k = 0, 1, ..., p

,

j, k = 1, ..., p

,

,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1.

it is an obvious generalization of the at space-time action given in [10]. one easily
veries that if x(), g() are world-volume scalars and v j () is a world-volume
contravariant vector density of weight q = 1/2, then l() is a scalar density of weight
q = 1. as a consequence, the variation of the action (1) is

s = z dp+1j (jl)

and thus this action is invariant under world-volume reparametrizations if suitable
boundary conditions are assumed.

varying (1) with respect to x and v j , one obtains the following equations of

motion :

j(cid:16)v j v kkx(cid:17) + 

v j v kj xkx = 0,
v j j xkxg(x) = 0,

where 

 is the connection compatible with the metric g(x):



 =

1
2

g(g + g  g).

(2)

let us rewrite for further convenience the lagrangian density (1) in the form ( =

/, j = /j):

l =

1
40 g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x,

where the connection between v j and (0, j) is given by

v j = (v 0, v j) =  

1

20 ,

j

20!.

now the euler-lagrange equation for x takes the form:

" 1

20 (  kk)x#  j" j

20 (  kk)x#
(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.

+

1
20

(3)

(4)

the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0 and j which follow from (3)
give the constraints :

g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0,
g(x)(  kk)xjx = 0.

(5)

we note (and it is easy to check) that in the gauge k = const,

x(, k) = x(k + k)

is a nontrivial solution of the equations of motion (4) and of the constraints (5), de-
pending on d arbitrary functions of p variables for the null p-brane moving in arbitrary
d-dimensional gravity background.

in terms of x and the conjugated momentum p the constraints (5) can be written

as:

t0 = g(x)pp = 0

,

tj = pjx = 0.

then one can show that the hamiltonian which corresponds to the lagrangian density
(3) is a linear combination of t0 and tj

h = z dp(0t0 + jtj).

computation of the poisson brackets between t0 and tj results in the following con-
straint algebra

{t0(1), t0(2)} = 0,
{t0(1), tj(2)} = [t0(1) + t0(2)]jp(1  2),
{tj(1), tk(2)} = [l
 = (1, ..., p).

ktj(2)]lp(1  2),

jtk(1) + l

(6)

comparing the equalities (6) with the zero tension limit of the bosonic p-brane at
space-time constraint algebra [11] we see that they coincide. however this is not the
case with the hamiltonian equations of motion of course. these are:

(  kk)x = 20g(x)p,
 p  k(kp) + 0g(x)pp = 0.

(7)

general solutions of the equations (7) can be easily found only in at space-times.
for example, the general solution for the null string case in an arbitrary gauge is [12]:

x(, 1) = g(v)  2
p(, 1) = f(v)/1(1),

1

z 0(s)
[1(s)]2 dsf (v),

3

where g(v), f(v) are arbitrary functions of the variable

v =  +

1

z

ds

1(s)

.

in curved space-times one can try to nd backgrounds in which the system of partial
dierential equations (7) essentially simplies. an example of this type are the confor-
mally at spaces, in which the equation of motion for p (in the gauge j = constants)
reduces to (  jj)p = 0 if we take into account the constraint t0 = 0, and has as
a general solution p(, k) = p(k + k).

3 null strings and membranes

in demianski-newman space-time

in this section we will work in the gauge 0, j = constants, in which the euler-

lagrange equations (4) have the form :
(  jj)(  kk)x + 

(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.

(8)

we are going to look for solutions of the equations of motion (8) and constraints (5) for
the null string (p = 1) and the null membrane (p = 2) moving in demianski-newman
background [9]. the metric for this space-time is of the following type:

ds2 = g00(dx0)2 + 2g01dx0dx1 + 2g03dx0dx3 + 2g13dx1dx3 + g22(dx2)2 + g33(dx3)2.

it can be put in a form in which the manifest expressions for g are given by the
equalities (all other components are zero) [13]:

,

g11 =  1 

a2 sin2 

g00 =  exp(+2u)
g22 = (cid:16)r2  a2 sin2 (cid:17) exp(2u),
g33 = r2 sin2  exp(2u) "2(mr + l)a sin2  + 2r2l cos 
g03 = 

2(mr + l)a sin2  + 2r2l cos 

r2 ! exp(2u),
#2

r2  a2 sin2 
exp(+2u),

where

exp(2u) = "1  2

r2  a2 sin2 
r2 + (a cos  + l)2 #1

mr + l (a cos  + l)

(9)

exp(+2u),

,

r2 = r2  2mr + a2  l2,

m is a mass parameter, a is an angular momentum per unit mass and l is the nut
parameter. the metric (9) is a stationary axisymmetric metric.
it belongs to the
vacuum solutions of the einstein eld equations, which are of type d under petrovs
classication. the kerr and nut space-times are particular cases of the considered
metric and can be obtained by putting l = 0 or a = 0 in (9). the case l = 0, a = 0
obviously corresponds to the schwarzschild solution.

taking into account the equalities (9), one can write the equations of motion (8)

and the constraints (5) for the null string case in the form:

(10)

where the notations u0,3 = (  11)x0,3 are used. to simplify these equations, we
use the ansatz

x0(, 1) = f 0(z1) + t( ),
x1(, 1) = r( )
x3(, 1) = f 3(z1) + ( ),

,

z1 = 1 + 1,

x2(, 1) = ( ),

(11)

where f 0, f 3 are arbitrary functions of their argument z1.

after substituting (11) in (10) and applying (2) for the given metric, we obtain (the

dot is used for dierentiation with respect to the ane parameter  ):

u0 +h(cid:16)g001g00 + g031g03(cid:17) u0 +(cid:16)g001g03 + g031g33(cid:17) u3i r

g11 r2 + g22 2 + g00(u0)2 + 2g03u0u3 + g33(u3)2 = 0,
(g001f 0 + g031f 3)u0 + (g031f 0 + g331f 3)u3 = 0.

(16)
(17)

to be able to separate the variables u0, u3 in the system of dierential equations

(12), (15), we impose the following conditions on f 0(z1) and f 3(z1)

f 0(z1) = c 0f (z1)

,

f 3(z1) = c 3f (z1),

where c 0, c 3 are constants, and f (z1) is an arbitrary function of z1. then the solution
of (12), (15) and (17) is [5] (c1 = const):

u0( ) = c1(cid:16)c 0g03 + c 3g33(cid:17) exp(h),
u3( ) = +c1(cid:16)c 0g00 + c 3g03(cid:17) exp(h),
h = z (cid:16)g00dg00 + 2g03dg03 + g33dg33(cid:17).

the condition for the compatibility of (18) with (13), (14) and (16) reads:

u0( ) = t( ) = c1(cid:16)c 0g03 + c 3g33(cid:17) h1,
u3( ) = ( ) = +c1(cid:16)c 0g00 + c 3g03(cid:17) h1,

h = g00g33  g2

on the other hand, from (14) and (16) one has:

in obtaining the rst equality in (21), we have used that for the metric (9) the

following condition is fullled:




(g22/g11) = 0.

finally, for the solution we have

x0 = c 0f (z1) + t( ),

x1 = r( ),

x2 = ( ),

x3 = c 3f (z1) + ( ), (22)

with t( ), r( ), ( ), ( ) given in (19), (20), and (21).

in the particular case when x2 =  = 0 = const, one can integrate to obtain an
exact solution of the equations of motion and constraints for the null string in the
gravity background (9). this solution is given by (22), where

+2

(24)

now we use the ansatz

x0(, ) = f 0(z1, z2) + t( ),

7

x1(, ) = r( )
x3(, ) = f 3(z1, z2) + ( ),

,

x2(, ) = ( ),

(25)

zj = j + j,

where f 0, f 3 are arbitrary functions of their arguments.

the substitution of (25) in (24) leads to the same equations (12)-(16) as for the
string. however, instead of one equation (17), one ends up with the following system
of two equations:

(g00jf 0 + g03jf 3)u0 + (g03jf 0 + g33jf 3)u3 = 0.

(26)

if we choose

f 0(z1, z2) = f 0(w)

,

f 3(z1, z2) = f 3(w),

where w = w(z1, z2) is an arbitrary function of z1 and z2, the system of equations (26)
reduces to the single equation

 g00

df 0
dw

+ g03

df 3

dw !u0 + g03

df 0
dw

+ g33

df 3

dw !u3 = 0.

(27)

in order to separate the variables u0, u3 in the system of dierential equations (12),

(15) using (27), we have to impose the following conditions on f 0(w) and f 3(w)

f 0(w) = c 0f [w(z1, z2)]

,

f 3(w) = c 3f [w(z1, z2)],

where c 0, c 3 are arbitrary constants as before, and f (w) is an arbitrary function of
w. then one proceeds as in the null string case to obtain the solution

x0 = c 0f [w(z1, z2)] + t( ),
x3 = c 3f [w(z1, z2)] + ( ),

x1 = r( ),

x2 = ( ),

(28)

where t( ), r( ), ( ), ( ) are given by (19), (20), and (21). if x2 =  = 0 = constant,
the set of equations for t( ), r( ), ( ) can be integrated completely. the corresponding
exact solution of the equations of motion and of the constraints for the null membrane
in the demianski-newman background is given by (28) with t,  and  taken from (23).

4 conclusions

in this letter we perform some investigations on the classical dynamics of the
null bosonic branes in curved space-times. in the second section we give the action,
show that it is reparametrization invariant and write down the equations of motion and
constraints in an arbitrary gauge. then we construct the corresponding hamiltonian
and compute the constraint algebra. it coincides with the at space-time algebra. the
hamiltonian equations of motion are also given. in the third section we consider the
dynamics of the null strings and membranes in the demianski-newman background.
some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints are found. in
particular, our null string solution (22), (23) generalizes the one obtained in [5] for the
kerr space-time.
