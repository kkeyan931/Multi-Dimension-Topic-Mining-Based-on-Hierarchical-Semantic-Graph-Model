abstract

we analytically and numerically investigate the t hooft-bergkno-eller
equations, the lowest order mesonic light-front tamm-danco equations for
u(nc) and su(nc) gauge theories. we nd the wavefunction can be well
approximated by new basis functions and obtain an analytic formula for the
mass of the lightest bound state. its value is consistent with the precedent
results.

i. introduction

light-front (lf) quantization is believed to be an eective method for studying many-
body relativistic eld theories [1,2]. the physical vacuum is equivalent to the bare vacuum
in the lf coordinate, since all constituents must have non-negative longitudinal momenta
dened by k+ = (k0 + k3)/2. this simple structure of the true vacuum enables us to avoid
the serious problems which appeared in the tamm-danco (td) approximation [3] in the
equal time frame. therefore, the td approximation [4] is commonly used in the context of
the lf quantization.

the techniques have been developed [57] for solving lftd equations in several models
such as the massive schwinger model [8], which is the extension of the simplest (1+1)-
dimensional qed2 [9]. bergkno [10] rst applied lftd approximation to the massive
schwinger model. he obtained the so-called bergkno equation, which is the light front
einstein-schrodinger equation truncated to one fermion-antifermion pair. he obtained ex-
cellent results for the lowest energy meson under t hoofts ansatz. he also discovered that
it is necessary to include two fermion-antifermion pairs in order to study the excited states.
ma and hiller [5] studied the lowest bergkno equation numerically. they devel-
oped their numerical method for solving the bergkno equation using an idea based upon
t hoofts ansatz.

mo and perry [6] suggested that even in the rst excited state, most of the wavefunction
consists of four fermion sectors when the fermion mass reaches zero. therefore, four or more
fermion sectors must be included so as to describe wavefunctions beyond the ground state
bosons.

in the bibliography [6], mo and perry presented an eective way to treat the ground state
and the excited state in the massive schwinger model. they concluded that to study the
massive schwinger model, the jacobi polynomials are suitable as basis functions. harada
and his coworker [7] studied the massive schwinger model with su(2) avor symmetry, in-
cluding up to four fermion sectors. they used simpler basis functions, which are essentially
equivalent to the jacobi polynomials. sugihara and collaborators [11] numerically analyzed
2-dimensional su(nc) quantum chromodynamics(qcd) [12], including four fermion sec-
tors, by means of the basis functions of harada et al.

although excellent papers exist concerning massless and massive schwinger models and
2-dimensional qcd [1619] , including excited states, it is worth analyzing the t hooft-
bergkno-eller equation [13], the extension of the t hooft-bergkno equation, in order to
include both su(nc) and u(nc) gauge theories. this is because there is a mathematical
interest in the basis function method. there is no mathematical evidence that the con-
ventional basis function expansion describes the wavefunction well; instead, the contrary is
rather to be supposed, as there is evidence that the conventional method breaks down if we
try to improve the approximation. we would therefore like to improve the basis functions
so as to avoid such diculties.

further, there is a so-called 2% discrepancy problem, briey summarized as follows:
we expand dimensionless meson mass squared m 2 in terms of dimensionless quark mass m,

m 2 = 1 + b1m + b2m2 +    ,

(1.1)

where

2

m 2 =

m 2

(nc)

and m2 =

m2

(nc)

.

(1.2)

here, m is a mass of bound state, m denotes a bare mass of quark, and (nc) stands for

(nc) =

(nc

2  1 + )g2
2nc

et al obtained rst order coecient b1 analytically, using the bosonization method,

. that is, we measure all masses in the unit of (nc). banks [14]

b1 = 2ee = 3.56214   ,

(1.3)

where e = 0.57721   is the eullers constant. on the other hand, bergkno [10] found
the value,

b1 =

2
3

= 3.62759   ,

(1.4)

which diers from eq.(1.3) by 2%. in [15], the authors suggested that the coecient b1 = 2
3
was a variational invariant and that this discrepancy was ascribable to the contributions from
the higher fock sectors. before proceeding on to consider the higher fock sectors, we have to
examine whether this discrepancy can be explained or not in terms of the lowest light-front
tamm-danco equation using all possible basis functions.

the t hooft-bergkno-eller equation for two dimensional gauge theory is given in the

form

(1.5)

where  denotes the nite part integral,  = 1 for u(nc), and  = 0 for su(nc). in eq.(1.5),
we shifted the variable x total amount of  1
2 compared with the variable in [10,12,13], in
order to show the symmetry of the wavefunction transparently.

mo and perry concluded in [6] that the jacobi polynomials, (1  4x2)p ,

n (2x) in our
notation, are the most suitable basis functions. this conclusion seems quite natural because
the system of the jacobi polynomials p ,
n (2x) is an orthogonal complete set on the interval
 1
2  x  1
2 with respect to the weight function (1  4x2). harada and collaborators [7]
suggested using the simpler basis functions, (1  4x2)+j and x(1  4x2)+j in our notation,
which are equivalent to the abovementioned ones. according to harada et al, one can expect
that the wavefunction could be expanded as follows:

(x) =

lim
n

lim
n

nxj=0
nxj=0

aj(1  4x2)+j,

bjx(1  4x2)+j.

(1.6)



here, we have used the fact, as is shown in appendix a, that the eller equation does not
mix even and odd functions with each other.

3

the exponent  and the quark mass m are related to each other by the equation [12,10]

(m2  1) +  cot  = 0.

(1.7)

the authors of references [5,10,7,11] adopted the positive smallest solution 0(m) of eq.(1.7)
as  in eq.(1.6). that is, for small m,

0(m) =

3m
  1 

m2

10! + o(m5)  0

1m + 0

3m3 +    .

(1.8)

in the following sections, we try to determine the coecients ans, according to the prede-
cessors.

ii. conventional basis function method

in this section, we restrict ourselves to the case  = 0 where the gauge group is su(nc).
mo and perry, and harada and his collaborators, presented eective way to determine the
coecients. we will briey reproduce their procedures. by the use of the expansion in
eq.(1.6) truncated to given nite number n for the wavefunction , we multiply both sides
of eq.(1.5) by (1  4x2)+i and integrate them over x, then we obtain

m 2cn~a = ch~a,

~a = t[a0, a1,   , an1].

here cn and ch are n  n matrices and are given by
dx(1  4x2)+i(1  4x2)+j =

(2.3)

basis functions we have used are not orthonormalized. in order to have eigenvalues of the
generalized eigenvalue equation given in eq.(2.1), we have to solve the eigenvalue problem

see appendix of [7]. so-called norm matrix cn appeared in the above equation because the
for norm cn rst, i.e.,
next, we introduce a transformation matrix cw by

cn~vi = i~vi.

(2.4)

(2.5)

cw ="

||~vn||n# .

then, we can transform eq.(2.1) into a usual eigenvalue problem of the form

m 2~b = tcwchcw~b,

~a = cw~b.

(2.6)

we can solve eq.(2.6), numerically. for n = 3 and m = 0.01, we nd, for the ground

state boson,

 = 0.00552328, m 2 = 0.0366342,
a0 = 1,

a1 = 0.00203562,

a2 = 0.000579369,

a3 = 0.000165813.

(2.7)

the values of the lhs and the rhs of eq.(1.5) are shown in fig. 1. the coincidence of the
lhs and the rhs is high for small values of x. for x  1/2, the behavior of the lhs and
the rhs are quite dierent. there are sharp spikes at the end points. this behavior is not
changed much even if we improve the order of approximation.

note here that in order to solve the generalized eigenvalue problem, the norm matrix
should be positive denite. we cannot advance the above procedure beyond n  12,
because some of the eigenvalues of the norm matrix n become almost zero or negative. we
will examine mathematically this approximated wavefunction in detail in the next section.
fig. 1

iii. an inspection of the conventional basis function method

a. behavior of wavefunction around x = 0

we introduce linear map l by

l : f 7 lf

such that

(lf ) (x) = z 1

(3.1)

after some tedious but not particularly dicult calculations, we nd that

l : x(1  4x2) 7 81/2 ( + 1)

( + 1/2)

( + 1/2)

f (1, 1/2  ; 1/2; 4x2)
x f (2, 1/2  ; 3/2; 4x2).

(3.2)

where f (a, b; c; x) is the gauss hypergeometric function [20]. see appendix a.

we restrict ourselves to the case where the wavefunction is an even function, because we

are interested in only the ground state meson. thus, we are led to

lim

( + n + 1/2)

f (1, 1/2    n; 1/2; 4x2)# . (3.3)

5

now, we can examine whether the numerical result obtained so far satises eq.(1.5) or

not. we substitute eq.(2.7) into the above equation, and obtain

lhs(x) = 0.0366936  0.00101207 x2  0.00165597 x4  0.00466671 x6 + o(x8)

(3.4)

and

rhs(x) = 0.0367133  0.0038283 x2 + 0.0503141 x4  0.210419 x6 + o(x8).

(3.5)

thus, the lhs and the rhs coincide, within numerical errors, with each other only up to
o(x0). we calculated coecients ans up to n = 10, but the coincidence between the lhs
and the rhs is not much improved. see fig. 1.

b. behavior of wavefunction near x =  1

2

bergkno suggested that the behavior of wavefunction  near end points x =  1

2 is
important in order to calculate the mass eigenvalue m 2.
in fact, eq.(1.7) is derived by
demanding that the most singular part, that is, the coecients of (1  4x2)1 on the
rhs in eq.(1.5) must be cancelled, as there is no such term on the lhs. according to
bergknos suggestion, we will examine the behavior of wavefunction near the end-points
beyond o(cid:18)(cid:16)1  4x2(cid:17)1(cid:19). we set 4x2 = 1  . by the use of the identity for the hyperge-
ometric functions, that is, eq.(15.3.6) in [20], which is valid for a + b  c 6= integer, we can
expand the rhs of eq.(3.3) around  = 0 and have

lhs = m 2 xn=0

and

rhs = 4(m2  1)

substituting the numerical solution, which is given in eq.(2.7), into eqs.(3.6) and (3.7),

we have

lhs() = 0.0366342  + 7.45734  105 +1  2.12247  105 +2 + o(+3)

(3.8)

and

rhs() = 0.551656  0.525734  + 2.09072   2.08014 +1 + o(2).

(3.9)

only 1 terms on the lhs and the rhs coincide with each other, because we dene 
so that the coecients of 1 cancel each other on the rhs. note that the lhs does not

6

contain n terms with non-negative integer n, while the rhs does. these tendencies are not
changed even if we calculate ans for n=3, 6 and 10.

if we rewrite the rst two terms of eq.(3.9) as

0.551656(1  ) + 0.025922,

(3.10)

we can see the origin of the spikes at the endpoints in fig. 1. the spikes arise from the
existence of the constant term in the wavefunction. the wavefunction (x)  1 is the exact
solution of eq.(1.5) for m2 = 0 and m 2 = 0 in su(nc). thus, one may expect that the
spikes at the end points are closely related to the existence of the massless bound state in
su(nc). this is not the case, however, because we can easily see that the constant term,
in the wavefunction, is allowed if and only if m2  0. we may conclude that the spikes are
nothing but the artifact which arose from the fact that we have used the improper basis
functions in eq.(1.6). in fact, we may remove the spikes if we use the suitable wavefunction.
refer to the next section.

the basis function given in eq.(1.6) cannot be a good mathematical approximation of
the true wavefunction. the reason is as follows: if we truncate the series eq.(1.6) to n, we
expect that eq.(1.5) holds up to o(+n1). we have only n + 1 parameters a1, a2,   , an
and m 2. on the other hand, we have 2n equations up to o(+n1). no consistent solution
can exist in general in this case.

the main diculty comes from the fact that l maps (1  4x2) not only to the terms
(1 4x2)+j1 with non-negative integer j but also to the terms (1 4x2)j. one may expect
that the above diculty is avoidable if the additional terms (1  4x2)j are introduced in
eq.(1.6). however, we can easily see that coecients of such terms must cancel. by the use
of the identity, that is eq.(15.3.11) in [20], we have for n  2

(1  4x2)k 

(3.11)

here, (z) denotes the digamma function. an analogous formula for n = 1 holds. see
eq.(15.3.10) in [20]. if we introduce a term (1  4x2)n in eq.(1.6) with positive integer n, a
new singular term like n1 log  appears only on the rhs. note that the exponent n of  is
the same as that of the introduced term. thus all the coecients of (1  4x2)n should be
zero.

iv. new basis function

we must notice that there are innite solutions of eq.(1.7) in addition to the solution

given by eq.(1.8). in fact, we see that

from eqs.(1.8) and (4.1), we are led to

0  n(m)  0(m)  n < 1/2,
0 < n(m)  k(m)  (n  k)  1.

(4.1)

(4.2)

the above relations imply that eq.(1.6) never incorporates terms like (1  4x2)n+j with
positive integer n and non-negative integer j.

we posit that the wavefunction is given by an innite series

(x) = lim
n

nxn=0

nnxj=0

cn

j(cid:16)1  4x2(cid:17)n(m)+j

.

(4.3)

for counting the number of free parameters and the number of nontrivial equations, we
consider the truncated wavefunction to given nite n. the truncated wavefunction includes
the term (1  4x2)n and all the other lower order terms. we require that eq.(1.5) should
hold up to o(1 4x2)n 1. for each given value of m, the unknown parameters are m 2 and
j except for c0
cn
. on the other hand
we have n (n +3)
table 1.

0  1. thus the number of the parameters is (n +1)(n +2)
nontrivial equations. see table i.

the number of parameters is larger than that of non-trivial equations by 1. thus, we
j in terms of m 2. another equation of use to us is obtained

can solve the equations for cn
by multiplying both sides of eq.(1.5) by (x) and integrating them over x,

(4.4)

it should be noted here that eq.(4.3) is, mathematically, the most general expansion.
this means that there is no room to introduce any other additional terms like d(1  4x2)
for  6= n + j with non-negative integers n and j. if we introduce such terms, then the
following equality should hold

0 = 4d(cid:16)m2  1 +  cot()(cid:17) (1  4x2)1.

(4.5)

this demands that d  0.

we may expect that coecient b1 depends on , as both coecients of m in eqs.(4.8)

note that we obtained the rst line in the above expansion without referring to the explicit
value of 1. we did not reproduce the result of banks et al, but that of bergkno. the ap-
proximated wavefunction in case m = 0.01 and n = 1 is shown in fig. 2. the approximation
used here is so rough that the coincidence of the lhs and the rhs is poor. nevertheless,
the behavior of the rhs near the end points is quite calm compared with the results of
the conventional basis function method. the smoothness of the rhs is quite natural. as
mentioned previously, the wavefunction given in eq.(4.3) is the most general. if we truncate
the wavefunction up to order n, it becomes smooth. so we may also expect the rhs of the
t hooft-bergkno-eller equation to be smooth.

fig. 2
we may expect that the coincidence of the lhs and the rhs will be improved if the
higher order terms are included. in cases where n  2, we cannot treat things analytically.
we will attempt to solve eq.(1.5) numerically by the use of new basis function in the next
subsection.

here,   1  4x2 as before. of course, the rst line in eq.(4.11) cancels automatically
because of the denition of ns. then, suppose that we truncate series in eq.(4.3) to
o(n ). that is, we set cn
j = 0 for n + j > n. for a given m, we put m 2 = m 2
i .
j in terms of mi. we thus obtain the mi dependent
we can then solve eq.(4.11) for cn
truncated wavefunction, say, (x; mi). we can calculate a new mass eigenvalue mi+1 using
this wavefunction as

10

m 2

i+1 =

< (mi)|h|(mi) >
< (mi)|(mi) >

.

(4.12)

we can use eq.(4.10) as m 2
0 . for n  15 and m = 0.01, mass m 2 converges in 5 iterations.
for 0 < m < 0.5, we obtain m 2s which are summarized in table ii. we can t them by
polynomials, as follows:

m 2( = 0, m) = 3.62763m + 3.58027m2 + 0.0683573m3 + o(m4)
m 2( = 1, m) = 1 + 3.62421m + 3.34492m2 + 0.213839m3 + o(m4).

(4.13)

it should be noted here that the coecients of m are consistent with eq.(4.10) and
bergknos result.
in order to see the ecacy of this new basis function expansion, we
show the wavefunctions in fig. 3.

v. summary and discussion

in the preceding sections we have introduced the new basis function and calculated the
mass eigenvalue of the bound state using the new basis function. we have found that (1)
the new basis function gives an eective approximation of the wavefunction, and (2) the
mass eigenvalues are consistent with the results of the precursors. in the remainder of this
section, we will discuss the 2% discrepancy problem.

let us consider the wavefunction given by

where we assume only 0 = 0
a1

1m + 1
1m1/2+ + o(m). we are then led to

(x) = (1  4x2)0 + a1(1  4x2)1,
3m3 + o(m5), 1 = 1

(5.1)

0 + 1

1m + o(m2), and a1 =

m 2  < |h| > / < | > =  +  1

0

12

3 ! m + o(m1+2).

(5.2)

1 = 0

when 0

this relation holds independently of the details of 0, 1, and a1, except for certain assump-
tions which were made before eq.(5.2). the coecient of m in eq.(5.2) has the minimum
3
value 2
 . we may therefore conclude that eq.(5.2) holds universally,
3
provided that:
(1) the wavefunction can be expanded as a power series of (1  4x2), like
(x) = (1  4x2)0 +pj=1 aj(1  4x2)j , 0 < 1 <   ,
and
(2)the coecients of the series, ajs, are of order m1/2+.

an almost identical result has been obtained by harada et al [15], in which they have
restricted themselves to a case where 0 = 0, and j = 0 + j. our conclusion is a
generalization of harada et als result. we, therefore, cannot solve the 2% discrepancy
problem in the context of the t hooft-bergkno-eller equations.
