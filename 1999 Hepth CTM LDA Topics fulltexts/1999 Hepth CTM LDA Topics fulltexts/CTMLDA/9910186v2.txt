abstract

we obtain a series expansion for the one loop fermion contribution
to the eective potential for constant aa
 elds in the su(2) theory
with a massive fermionic doublet. the series converges for bounded
electric elds in terms of the magnetic elds and the gauge potentials.
one nds that spontaneous fermion pair creation may be absent for
arbitrary strong pure electric elds, with an appropriate choice of the
classical currents.

fifty years ago, in a famous q.e.d. calculation [1] j. schwinger obtained
the h contribution to the electromagnetic eective lagrangian for constant
(classical) elds. it seems there are no similar results for fermionic contri-
butions in non-abelian theories. our intention here is to briey present a
calculation for the analogous quantity in the su(2) theory with a j = 1
massive fermionic multiplet. we restrict to this representation for mainly
technical reasons: for this representation calculations signicantly simplify
due to the properties of pauli matrices (see the next footnote). we mention
from start, that unlike in ref.
[1], our result is not of maximum generality
by failing to apply to certain eld congurations, as it will become apparent
from our computational procedure.

2

two aspects specic to non-abelianity are of direct relevance in what fol-
lows. first, constant gauge potentials do not necessarily imply the vanishing
of the eld strengths. we shall do the calculations precisely for this case, i.e.
(all notations are conventional)

aa

(x) = const,

(1)

so that we shall actually obtain the h eective potential. second, constant
eld strengths do not entail the vanishing of the corresponding classical cur-
rents. (in fact, under conditions (1) a null current necesarilly means a pure
gauge.) also in contrast to the abelian case, the classical equations deter-
mine the currents in terms of the eld strengths and the potentials (via the
covariant derivatives). physically, this is expected to manifest in the explicit
dependence of the quantum contribution on both of these quantities, as we
shall indeed nd out.

we begin by writing the basic lagrangian as

l = 
f a
 = aa

f a + i (  iaa
f a
  aa

 + abcab

 ac
,



a
)  m ,
2
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3.

(2)

(3)

we included for simplicity the coupling constant into the denitions of aa
,
f a
. as a rst step, we need the one loop eective action for the classical
aa
 eld. this is most directly obtained in the path integral formalism by
integrating out the  eld

sef f = i lnz d d exp is[aa

, , ],

(4)

2

(s is the classical action). it is clear that ghost terms are unnecessary here.
the integral is a gaussian in grassmannian variables, which can be evaluated
by standard methods [2]. one nds for the h fermionic contribution

s 1,f
ef f = i ln det (((p  aa



a
2

)  m),

(5)

where det is the determinant in the functional sense and p are the trans-
lation operators in coordinates space. m tacitly incorporates the i prescrip-
tion. our subsequent eorts will be to extract information from eq. (5).

using the charge conjugation matrix cc 1 = t

 and the properties
of the determinant, one can eliminate the gamma matrices (see ref. [3]) to
obtain

s 1,f
ef f = 

i
2

ln det ((p  aa



a
2

)2  m2).

(6)

we use next the ln det=tr ln formula and the schwinger representation
for the logarithm. when tracing over space-time coordinates, translational

invariance allows separation of the four-volume factor r d4x. the trace over

spinorial indices yields simply a 4 factor. tracing over the group indices
amounts to evaluate, after expanding the square in eq. (6), the trace of a
su(2) matrix1 in exponential parameterization. one nally arrives to the
following expression for the eective potential (a2 = aa

aa):

ds

v 1,f

ef f = 4iz 
(2)4 cos sq(paa

d4p

exp is(m2 + a2/4)
) exp isp2  st.

)(paa

z

(7)

st stands for a subtraction term corresponding to the expression evaluated
at null potentials. consider a four vector k with k k = a2. one can
easily verify that st can be obtained by replacing the cos factor in the second
integral with

cos s(pk)

(8)

1for j > 1/2 representations, anticommutations of the group generators will generally
lead to su(2j+1) elements. the quantity under square root in eq. (7) becomes then a
generalized quadratic form in p, making the d4p integral more dicult.

3

and leaving a2 unchanged. we shall consider this quantity to perform the
subtraction, instead of that resulting by simply setting aa
 = 0. this trick
will make apparent at the end of the calculations that, as expected, the
potential vanishes for f a

 = 0.

we rotate next the p integration contours as (latin indices i, j, k run over

1, 2, 3)

(9)

4 pi,

4 p0,

pi  ei 

p0  ei 
making the exp factor in eq.
(7) a gaussian in p0, pi, and shift to four-
dimensional spherical coordinates. at this point, unfortunately, a further
closed evaluation becomes rather impossible: with a series of integration
0 dz sin az expsz2 (a con-
by parts the radial integration can be written r 
tains the angular and aa
 dependence) letting itself expressed [4] in terms
of er(a/2s), which makes the angular integration untractable. we shall
continue by expanding the cosines in taylor series, with the obvious mention
that by doing so we lost maximum generality. the validity of the result will
be discussed a little further.

after performing the radial integration, each term yields a nite result
for s > 0 xed. to account for the angular integration, it is convenient to
dene the matrices

similarly for k,

(12)

notations in eq.
(12) are as follows: n is the unit four-vector nn =
1, the lowered indices indicating summation with respect to the euclidean
metric. the integrations extends over the euclidean 3-sphere, with dn the
innitesimal angle around n.

the behavior with respect to s integration for s  0 formally splits v 1,f

into an innite and a nite part. the innite part reads

the rst two terms, however, vanish due to the angular integrations (cf. eq.
(20) below)

v0 = v1 = 0.

(14)

for n = 2, the s integral diverges logarithmically, but this is also no trouble
since

v2 =

f a
f a.

(15)

the divergence is proportional to the pure yang-mills lagrangian, which
amounts to a wave function and coupling constant renormalization. discard-
ing an innite contribution and imposing the quantum contribution to vanish
for aa

  0, one obtains the renormalized quantity

the polynomials under the radicals are, in order, the determinants of the
matrices in the exponent in eq.
(19) corresponding to a, k superscripts
respectively. this concludes our calculation. note that the indeterminacy
introduced by k disappeared.

it is transparent from eqs. (20)-(23) that for vanishing eld strengths all
ef f = 0. one sees also that, as already pointed

vn are zero, which makes v 1,f
out, an explicit dependence on the potentials survives through a2.

we come now to the question of the convergence of series (17). numerical

factors for n   imply it behaves as

4n vn.

we shall demand, for safety, convergence of each sum dened by the two
square roots in eq. (20). for the second one, one readily recognizes the z1

power expansion of q1 + z1/4, so we have to set

or

|z1| < 4,

  < a2 < 2m2.

(25)

(26)

for the rst sum, we proceed as follows. one sees that 0 = 0 is always an
eigenvalue2 of a
, and let us denote 1, 2, 3 the remaining ones. this
x = 0 for all a, hence

2there always exists a non-zero vector x such that aa

(27)

(28)

(29)

a closer inspection of inequalities (28) reveals that for a2 and ba xed, they
dene a bounded set in the ea space. analysis in general case proves fairly
involved, as solutions of a cubic equation have to be considered explicitly.
we shall restrict to the special situation3 z3 = 0, or

e1  (b2  b3) + e2  (b3  b1) + e3  (b1  b2)  b1  (b2  b3) = 0,

(30)

for which things become particularly simple. one nds that conditions (28)
reduce, for all r, to the single inequality

e 2 < b 2 + 16m4 1 

a2

4m2! 1  (a2)

a2

2m2! ,

where

e 2 = ea  ea, b 2 = ba  ba,

(31)

(32)

and  is the heaviside step function. we mention that in arriving to eq. (31)
we used, in addition, the inequality

e 2  b 2  (a2)2/3,

(33)

which results as a direct consequence of denitions of ea, ba in terms of aa
.

3an immediate example are the pure electric elds ba = 0.

7

relation (31) deserves a comment: it implies that for b 2 xed and a2 < 0
variable, there is generally no denite upper bound for e 2. with a proper
choice of the gauge potentials (or of the classical currents), one can set it ar-
bitrarily high. one can easily check, for example, that for pure electric elds
a2 can be taken arbitrarily large and negative, while keeping ea constants.
it is interesting to note that convergence is always assured for pure mag-
netic elds ea = 0, no special conditions assumed. one can always consider
in this case aa
0 = 0, automatically satisfying eq. (26). (non-zero temporal
components demand ba = 0 too. one can directly show then the second
integral in eq. (7) is independent of aa
.) one further notes that i1,2,3 are
real and positive, as the matrix ia
jk is real, symmetric and positive denite.
from the positivity of trace one has

0 <

3

xr=1

ir = z1 < 4,

(34)

which means that inequalities (28) are also assured.
we end with the obvious observation that v 1,f

ef f contains no absorptive
part.
it follows that for eld congurations to which our result applies,
no spontaneous fermion pair creation occurs. convergence conditions for-
mulated above can be regarded as sucient conditions to forbid this phe-
nomenon, to order h. in particular, one comes to the non-trivial conclusion
that fermion pair creation does not necessarily take place for pure electric
elds, in contrast to the well known case of quantum electrodynamics. ab-
sence of the absorptive part in our result is, in fact, not surprising: one
knows that particle creation in time independent elds is essentially a non-
perturbative eect [5]. in our calculation, this quality was clearly lost (in a
strict sense, at least) with the taylor expansion of the cos factors in eq. (7).
