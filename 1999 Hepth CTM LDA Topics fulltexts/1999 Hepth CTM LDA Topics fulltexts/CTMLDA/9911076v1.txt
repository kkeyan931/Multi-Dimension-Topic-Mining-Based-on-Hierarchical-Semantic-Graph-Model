abstract

applying the distributional formalism to study the dynamics of thin shells in general
relativity, we regain the junction equations for matching of two spherically symmetric
spacetimes separated by a singular hypersurface. in particular, we have shown how to
dene and insert the relevant sign functions in the junction equations corresponding to
the signs of the extrinsic curvature tensor occurred in the darmoisisrael method.

1 introduction

recently a distributional method has been developed to solve directly the einsteins
eld equations for thin shells embedded in an arbitrary spacetime[1]. this method
requires construction of spacetime coordinates that match continuously on the shell and
in which the fourmetric based on the lichnerowicz condition [2], is continuous, but has
a nite jump in its rst derivatives on the shell, so that its curvature tensor will contain
a dirac delta function.
so far the spherical thin shells in static spherically symmetric spacetimes and the case of
cylindrically symmetric thin layers have been solved by this method[3,4]. in addition, an
explicit formulation of distributional method for handling nonlightlike surface layers and
its equivalence to the jump conditions of darmoisisrael method through the analysis of
the bianchi identities has been represented [1].
on the other hand, it has been shown in the last years that in the framework of darmois
israel formalism, the sign of the angular component of the extrinsic curvature tensor of the
shell, namely k 
 , play a key role in the classication of the global spherically symmetric
spacetime structures, as mentioned by sato [5], berezin, kuzmin, tkachev [6] and sakai
and maeda [7]. this sign function gives us information related to increase or decrease of
the relevant coordinate in the direction normal to the shell. in the distributional method
of mansourikhorrami mentioned above this sign function, in spite of its importance, has
not yet been introduced. the aim of this paper is to show how one can generate the
necessary sign functions in the framework of mansourikhorrami distributional method.
in this way we will show the full equivalence of the sign functions introduced and their
role in the junction equations with the corresponding signs of the extrinsic curvature k 

on the both sides of the shell in the darmoisisrael approach.
the paper is arranged as follows. in section 2 we review shortly the distributional method
for thin shells due to mansouri and khorrami. in section 3 this distributional formalism
is applied to the junction of two schwarzchild-de sitter spacetimes through a timelike
spherical thin shell. section 4 is devoted to the junction equations for two frw space-
times bounded by a nonlightlike spherical thin shell.
conventions and denitions: we use the signature (+) and put c = 1. greek indices
run from 0 to 3. overdot denotes dierentiation with respect to the shell proper time
 . the square brackets, [f], are used to indicate the jump of any quantity f across the
shell. as we are going to work with distributional valued tensors, there may be terms in
a tensor quantity f proportional to some function. these terms are indicated by f .

2 distributional method

consider a spacetime manifold m consisting of overlapping domains m+ and m with
+ and x
,

) in terms of independent disconnected charts x

metrics g+

(x

+) and g

(x

respectively. the common boundary of the domains is denoted by p. in other words, the
manifolds m+ and m are glued together along the common boundary p. the equation

2

of p is written as (x) = 0, where  is a smooth function, and x is a single chart called

admissible coordinate system (e.g., skew- gaussian coordinates attached to geodesics)
that covers the overlap and reaches into both domains. the domains of m in which 
is positive or negative are contained in m+ or m, respectively [8]. by applying the
coordinate transformations x
(x) on the corresponding domains, a pair of metrics
(x) and g
g+
(x) is formed over m+ and m respectively, each suitably smooth (say
c 3).
the main step in the distributional approach is the denition of a hybrid metric g(x)
over m which glues the metrics g+

 = x

(x) and g

(x) together continuously on p:

g = g+

() + g

(),

(1)

(2)

where  is the heaviside step function and

[g(x)] = 0.

we expect on p the curvature and ricci tensor to be proportional to  function. it follows

from (1) and (2) that the rst derivative of g is proportional to the step function. the
 distribution can only occur in the second derivative of the metric which enters linearly
in the expressions for curvature and ricci tensor. so the only relevant terms in the ricci
tensor are[1]

r = 

,  

,.

(3)

using the metric in the form (1), we nally arrive at the following expression for the
components of the ricci tensor proportional to  distribution [1, see also 8 and 9]

r =   1

2g

[g,]  h

i ! (),

(4)

where g is the determinant of the metric and the partial derivatives are done with re-
spect to the coordinates x. the einsteins equations for the dynamics of the singular

hypersurface or thin shell p is then conveniently written as

r = 8g( t 

t g).

2

(5)

the energymomentum tensor of the shell t, considered as a distribution, is given by
[1,8]

t = ||s(),

(6)

where s is the surface 4- tensor of energy-momentum of the shell, and  is related to
the unit normal four-vector n of the shell:

n = 1,

3

(7)

with

 = q|g |.

(8)

in this way the unit normal vector n is always directed from m  to m +. now, we require
that the admissible coordinates be such that the vector n is in the direction of increasing

it is convenient to choose the negative (positive) sign in (8) for time(space)like p [1,6,8].
a space or timelike admissible coordinate x corresponding to time or spacelike p.

this is no restriction to the choice of the admissible coordinates, as we are always free
to choose m+ instead of m or vise versa. note that in general, n may point towards
greater or smaller values of a space or timelike coordinate x
, which is the case in
some of the spherically symmetric examples we are going to consider. there we will see
the crucial role of these denitions and their leading to the sign function needed to glue
dierent manifolds.
in the following we restrict ourselves to timelike hypersurfaces. the case of spacelike
hypersurfaces is very similar and will be treated in the appendix. having a consistent
denition of admissible coordinates and the direction of n, we will look for a sign function
similar to that in the darmoisisrael method and crucial for the topological classication
of manifolds to be glued together. this can best be seen in the case of spherically symmet-
ric space times we are going to consider in this paper. assume a congruence of timelike

hypersurfaces parallel to p. let r be the physical radius of the 2d spheres parallel
to p in m . moving in the direction of n, each of the r may either increase or de-

crease, depending on the nonstaticity and topology of m . therefore, we may dene
the following sign functions:

 = sgn(cid:16)n r(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

,

(9)

where  take the values +1 or 1 accordingly as r increase or decrease along the
normal vector n directed from m to m+. we will see in the next sections that this sign
functions correspond to that introduced in darmoisisrael method related to the sign of
k 

 [7, 8, 10].

now, the boundary p maybe just a singular hypersurface or a thin layer.

in general,
we may therefore assume for the boundary a surface energymomentum tensor s of a
perfect uid type given by

s = uu + w(h  uu),

(10)

where u is the unit four-velocity of any observer whose world line lies within the shell; 
and  are respectively the surface-energy density and tension measured by that observer.

h denotes the induced three-metric on p and is written as

h = g + nn.

(11)

we are now ready to apply the above formalism to obtain the junction conditions in
spherically symmetric spacetimes, bounded by a timelike shell. the corresponding junc-
tion equations for spacelike shells will be given in the appendix.

(14)

where r(t) is the radius of the shell as a function of the relevant timelike coordinate t.
now, we apply the following transformations to make the metric continuous on the shell

r+ = a(r, t),
t+ = b(r, t),

r = c(r, t),
t = d(r, t).

where f(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

comparing (20) and (21) with the signs of k 
obtained by the darmois-israel method,
we can see that  generated by the transformations (15) in the distributional method,
are equivalent to the undetermined signs of the normals n
 dened in the darmois- israel
approach [6,7,10]. it is assumed that t and  , the shell proper time, are future directed,
so that b and d are positive. then in the r region mentioned by berezin et al [6,11],
> 0, the sign factors  dierenciate the interior-exterior characters of m
[7,10], and the sign functions  are just determined by  according to (20) and (21).
thus the global topology of static spherically symmetric space-times is determined by
:
if + = , then we have an ordinary centered shell (black hole type matching); if
 = 1 and + = +1, then we have a shell in a space-time with no center (wormhole
matching);if  = +1 and + = 1, then the shell is in a space-time with two centers
(anti-wormhole matching)[1013]. note that these matchings can best be visualized in
terms of kruskal coordinates. section i of kruskal diagram corresponds to  = +1 and
section iv corresponds to  = 1. therefore an ordinary centered shell corresponds to
matching of two section i or two section iv manifolds. it is also possible to glue dierent
part of section i to iv or vise versa which leads to other possibilities discussed above[11].
we restrict now, without loss of generality of the matching, the transformation (15) on
the chart x

 to the conditions

t = t,

= .

(24)

this allows us to generate the sign function  properly. note that in the original distri-
butional formalism of mansouri-khorrami it was set  = 1, which means no coordinate
transformation of the chart x
[3, 4]. this was a restriction to the topology of the manifold
m . using (24), the set of equations (16) can be solved for the unknown functions in

where for a given , the same sign factor + = 1 takes care of the two possible solutions

for a,r, a,t, b,r and b,t in (16). it is easily seen from (25) that the sign of (b,ta,rb,ra,t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

is determined by + independent of the sign factor , in accordance with (22). it is also

seen that the metric g
or when m has a center ( = +1).
we would like to note that in principle one may choose the restriction r = r and
which

=  with d = t instead of (24). this, however, leads to d,r(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

becomes divergent for static shells ( r = 0).
to proceed further, we need the derivatives of the time coordinates on both sides of the
shell with respect to its proper time,  . it is easily seen that

the junction equations and dynamics of the singular hypersurface is given by the equation

obtained by berezin et al [6].

where h are the hubble parameters for m, and the sign factors + and  are the same
as that given by (22) and (23) respectively, dierentiating the interior-exterior characters
of a at or open universe(for a closed universe one can change the signs of  by the coor-
dinate transformations     , see ref.[10]). note that these relations correspond
to eq.(5) in ref. [7].
similarly, we have assumed t and  to be future directed. for given  and k, one
can determine the topology of frw space times regardless of the signs of . (a list of
possible topology types has been given in ref.
[7]). in other words, we may have any
sign of  for any known value of  and k. particularly for k+  0 and  > 0, the
sign of + can be negative, if the comoving radius of the shell decreases in time, namely if
a < 0 or equivalently, if the peculiar velocity of the shell v+
observed in m+ is
negative. therefore, when the second term in the expression within the brackets in (43),

pe = a+

b(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which is negative, becomes large, + becomes negative. it can be shown that in this case
the size of the shell is larger than the hubble length in m+, i.e. h 1
+ , as mentioned by
sakai and maeda [7]. the possibility of negative value for + in the at or open universe
(k+  0) had been missed in ref. [6].
again, without loss of generality, we may restrict the transformations(40) on the chart
x
 by requiring

t = t,

using these restrictions we obtain

5 conclusion

in glueing dierent manifolds together, the global characterization of the glued mani-
fold is of utmost importance. this characterization depends basically on the signs of k 
 ,
which is the central quantity in the darmoisisrael approach. so far such global classi-
cations had been neglected within the distributional approach of mansourikhorrami.

12

now, we have been able to dene the relevant sign functions  properly by the equation
(9), and to insert them in the junction equations, so that the global classication of spher-
ically symmetric space-times glued together can also be done within this distributional
formalism. this makes the mansourikhorrami formalism as general as possible and, in
some cases, more suitable to apply than darmoisisrael method. it has been successfully
applied to solve special problems like the dynamics of two shells[14] or thick shells [15]
within general relativity
we have also seen, given the unique normal n in the distributional formalism, that
the sign factors + and  are independently generated by applying the transformations
x
+ = x
(x) on m+ and m respectively. this is in contrast to the
darmoisisrael method in which the sign factors are inserted in front of the normal vec-
tors n
 . our sign factors are naturally related to the interior-exterior characterizations
of m [7,10]. in addition, we have seen that to include the most general case of glueing
manifolds in the distributional formalism along the singular hypersurface it is not enough
to make a coordinate transformation on just one of the manifolds to make the fourmetric
continuous. we have to apply the nontrivial transformations x
(x) on both sides
of the shell to generate the sign factors . these generalizations had been neglected in
the papers [3,4]. it should also be noted that admissible coordinates have to be such that
the relevant coordinate along the vector n is increasing.

appendix: junction equations in the spherically sym-
metric spacetimes separated by a spacelike shell

the following junction equations for frw space times bounded by a spacelike shell
can be obtained from (59) and (61) by means of the substitutions   i,   i
and   i, where  is the distance from the center of the sphere of the radius r():
