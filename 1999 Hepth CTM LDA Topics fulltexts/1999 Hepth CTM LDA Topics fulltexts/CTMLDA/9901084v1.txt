abstract

it is shown, that recently constructed pst lagrangians for chi-
ral supergravities follow directly from earlier kavalovmkrtchyan la-
grangians by an ansatz for the  tensor by expressing this in terms of
the pst scalar. the susy algebra which included earlier symmetry
in the commutator of supersymmetry transformations, is now shown to
include both pst symmetries, which arise from the single symmetry
term. the lagrangian for the 5-brane is not described by this cor-
respondence, and probably can be obtained from more general la-
grangians, posessing symmetry.

1 introduction

among elds appearing in modern higher-dimensional theories are the (anti)
selfdual tensor elds, describing the representations of corresponding lit-
tle groups with the constraint of (anti)selfduality. such tensors have a
rank, corresponding to dimensionality and signature of spacetime, and sat-
isfy rstorder eld equations  the condition of selfduality of their eld
strength.
in spacetime with one time dimension the duality condition is
possible in dimensions 2, 6, 10, etc. in 2 dimensions the elds are the chiral
scalars, used e.g. in heterotic string theories [1]. in dimensions 6 and 10 the
rst theories considered, including as a necessary part a selfdual (or anti
selfdual) tensor, were supergravities [2], particularly 10 dimensional n = 2b
supergravity - one of two maximal supergravities (another one is 11d n = 1
supergravity [3]), dimensional reduction of which to 4d gives maximally ex-
tended n = 8 supergravity [4]. recently another theory with selfdual eld
attracted much attention  the sixdimensional theory, known as 5-brane
theory [5][6], which is an important feature of mtheory. the unique prop-
erty of these elds is their contribution to the gravitational anomaly [7], the
only contribution coming from bosonic elds. this property is intimately
connected with the fact, that it is impossible to write down the lagrangian
for such a eld in the usual way  and correspondingly the regularization of
quantum theory meets a diculty, which eventually leads to the appearance
of the anomaly.

the problem of construction of lagrangians for dual tensors, and eventu-
ally lagrangians for theories mentioned above was addressed in a number of
papers. several methods were suggested for the construction of lagrangians,
among which are that of siegel [8], the innite auxiliary eld method [9],
and the recently invented pst formalism [10]. the generalization of the
rst one was used in the papers of kavalov and mkrtchyan about ten years
ago[11], in which lagrangians for all chiral supergravities were constructed
for the rst time. recently the equivalence of the pst and innite auxiliary
eld methods was claimed [12], and the lagrangians for supergravities in the
pst formalism were constructed [13]. the aim of the present paper is to
show, that lagrangians of ref.
[11]
from an ansatz for the lagrangian multiplier ++
,, and that the symme-
try algebra, which includes the socalled symmetry, transforms into the
algebra, containing specic pst symmetries, the origin of these terms being

[10] follow directly from those of ref.

exactly the symmetry terms. the correspondence with the method of ref.
[9] can also be established.
in the following the detailed proof is given of
the equivalence of the lagrangians and the relations between the symmetry
transformations. section 2 is devoted to denitions and the description of
properties of selfdual tensors. sections 3 and 4 present the lagrangians of
kavalov and mkrtchyan, as well as symmetry and the pst formulation.
the ansatz for the transformation of one theory into another is presented
in sect. 5, together with the transformation of symmetries. the algebra of
symmetries is considered in the next section, where the appearance of two
pst symmetries from a single symmetry transformation is demonstrated.
in section 6 we summarise our results and make concluding remarks.

2 denitions

we dene the antisymmetric second rank tensor a in d = 5 + 1 dimensions
with selfdual eld strength f by the following relations:

a = a, ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
f = a + a + a ,

we use (anti)symmetrization with unit weight, for example:

we can then prove the following identities valid for arbitrary antisymmet-

3 the symmetry formalism for chiral

bosons

we consider the following action, introduced in the work of kavalov and
mkrtchyan [11], which involves tensor a and the sixthrank tensor ++
,,
the latter being selfdual over each set of three indices:

skm = z d6x(cid:26)

(16)

the tensor  serves as a lagrange multiplier. from the lagrangian of (13)
we obtain the following equations of motion:

f 
f 
(cid:16)f   ++,f 

(cid:17) = 0

these equations are equivalent to the selfduality-condition:

f

and do not impose any restriction on the auxiliary eld ++
to the usual gauge invariance:

,. in addition

a = 2[]

(20)

skm is also invariant with respect to the so-called symmetry with vector
parameter  dened by:

(23)

using this approach for the lagrangian of selfdual elds, in refs.
[11] the
supersymmetric lagrangians were constructed for all supergravities, contain-
ing such elds in their supermultiplets (and even nonchiral supergravities
were presented in such a form). the symmetry (21) is maintained in these
lagrangians, and plays an important role in the closure of the algebra of sym-
metries of the theory. in particular the part appears on the r.h.s of the
commutator of two local supersymmetry transformations in all supergravities
[11]:

[(2), (1)] = (dif f ) + (lorentz) + (gauge) + ()

(24)

+ (susy) + (eq. of motion)

the explicit expressions depend, of course, on the specic theory consid-
ered, but the algebra (24) remains the same. moreover, the parameter of
symmetry is always equal to the parameter of the general coordinate trans-
formation:  = . as an example and fot further use, we quote here some
expressions for the simplest case of d = 6, n = 2 chiral supergravity (nota-
tion as in [11]):

the susy transformation of  is:

4 the pasti-sorokin-tonin formulation of the

chiral boson

the action constructed in ref. [10] is:

sp st = z d6x(

ff  +

2

(aa)

af 

f a)

(27)

where the scalar eld a is an auxiliary eld, analogous to  of the previous
section. this action is invariant under the following local gauge transforma-
tion:

1()a =

2(x)

(aa)

a,
f 

1a = (x)

2()a = a   ,

2a = 0

(28)

(29)

as in the previous section, there is only one independent equation of motion,
in this case that of a:

[ 

1

(aa)

af 

]a! = 0

with the general solution:

(30)

(31)

f 

a = 2()hf 

ai

which is equivalent to the selfduality condition due to the gauge invari-
ance (29), which allows us to bring to zero the r.h.s of (31), and the self
duality equation follows. as mentioned above, this approach was used for
the construction of the 5brane action [10], and also the actions for chiral
supergravities as in [13].

in the next section we shall establish a connection between the two ap-
proaches, and in particular between expressions and symmetries of actions
for chiral supergravities.

5 the ansatz

evidently actions (13) and (27) are connected by the ansatz for :

++ 

 = 6  aa

(aa)


 

!++

++ 
 f 

 = 6f 

[  ]aa

(aa)

(cid:17)++



= 6(cid:16)n

(32)

(33)

(34)

or, equivalently, using (7) to (12) and (14) to (16)

++

(aa)

= 6  [aa
= 3(cid:16)p +n p (cid:17) 





]

[! p  
+ 3(cid:16)p +n p (cid:17)



the ansatz, which we shall use to establish the connection between super-
gravities, diers from (34) in that all indices of  have to be at ones, so that
world indices of derivatives of the scalar eld have to be transformed into at
ones by sixbeins. with this understanding, it can easily be checked term
byterm that lagrangians of [13] can be obtained from that of [11] by this
substitution of . the question arises: what happens with the symmetry
transformations and the algebra of symmetries? it is easy to check, that the
rst pst symmetry (28) is a particular case of the symmetry (21), with
the following ansatz for the parameter :

(x) =

(x)a
(aa)

(35)

in particular, the entire transformation (22) follows from the shift of a in the
ansatz (34). the same statement applies to the supersymmetry transforma-
tion. the susy transformations of [13] are in agreement with that of [11],
particularly with (25), under the ansatz (34). since in the pst formalism
the susy transformation of the auxiliary scalar eld a is zero, the whole ex-
pression (25) essentially originates from the transformation of the metric in
the scalar product of ansatz (34), or from transformation of sixbeins in the
same expression, needed for conversion of world indices of a into at ones
of the tensor . next, there is no analogue for the second pst symmetry in

7

(29). this raises the question about the commutator of susy transformations
(24), which according to [13] contain both pst symmetries. remarkably,
the expression for the symmetry transformation in the commutator (24)
splits into a sum of two pst symmetries with special parameters:

()a =

2(a)
(aa)

a
f 

a

(aa) #  a"2f 

+ a" 2f 
= 1(cid:16)a(cid:17) a + 2  2f 

a

(aa) #
(aa) ! a

a

(36)

thus although the formalism [11] does not contain the second pst symme-
try, the latter arises, after substitution of the ansatz, from the symmetry
transformation term in the commutator of the susy transformations.this
last point completes our establishment of the connection between supergrav-
ity lagrangians of [11] and those of [13] (as communicated earlier privately
[14]).

6 conclusions

above we have established the connection between two formalisms, i.e. that
of symmetry, used about ten years ago for the construction of lagrangians
of supergravities with (anti)selfdual tensors, and the recently invented pst
formalism, which solves the same problem, and permits, in addition, the con-
struction of the 5-brane lagrangian. it appears, that lagrangians of super-
gravities are connected through the ansatz, which connects the auxiliary eld
of both formalisms, i.e. the tensor  and the scalar a. the transformation of
symmetry terms into the pst symmetries, in the algebra of supersymme-
try transformations, has been demonstrated. also the agreement of rules for
symmetries, particularly supersymmetries, has been demonstrated above.

beyond the scope of this connection there remains the problem of the la-
grangian for the 5brane, which so far has been established in lorentz invari-
ant form only in the pst formalism. probably the latter can be constructed
within the symmetry formalism by considering more general expressions,
satisfying the symmetry requirement. it may be noted that symmetry

8

strongly resembles reparametrization invariance, and the problem is some-
thing like the construction of actions with general coordinate invariance.
