spin-2 gauge theories and perturbative gauge

invariance

g unter scharf and mark wellmann

abstract. in the framework of causal perturbation theory we analyze the
gauge structure of a massless self-interacting quantum tensor eld. we look at
this theory from a pure eld theoretical point of view without assuming any
geometrical aspect from general relativity. to rst order in the perturbation
expansion of the s-matrix we derive necessary and sucient conditions for such
a theory to be gauge invariant, by which we mean that the gauge variation of
the self-coupling with respect to the gauge charge operator q is a divergence
in the sense of vector analysis. the most general trilinear self-coupling of the
graviton eld turns out to be the one derived from the einstein-hilbert action
plus divergences and coboundaries.

1. introduction

the general theory of relativity can be viewed as a theory for a self-interacting
massless spin-2 eld. this theory of gravity is derived from the einstein-hilbert
(e-h) lagrangian

leh = 

2

gr

(1.1)

where r = g r is the ricci scalar and 2 = 32g (g is newtons gravitational
constant). it is convenient to work with goldberg variables [10]

g = gg

which one expands in an asymptotically at geometry

g =  + h

(1.2)

(1.3)

here  is the metric of minkowski spacetime. then (1.1) becomes an innite
power series in :

the rst order term l1

there exists many alternative derivations of this result (1.6), starting from
massless tensor elds and requiring consistency with gauge invariance in some
sense [9, 13, 14, 21, 17]. in classical theory the work closest to our non-geometrical
point of view is the one of ogievetsky and polubarinov [18]. these authors analyze
spin-2 theories by working with a generalized hilbert-gauge condition to exclude

1

2

the spin one part from the outset. they impose an invariance under innitesimal
gauge transformations of the form

h = u + u +  u

(1.7)

and get einsteins theory at the end.
instead wyss [23] and deser [3] consider
the coupling to matter. then the self-coupling of the tensor-eld (1.6) is necessary
for consistency. wald [22] derives a divergence identity which is equivalent to an
innitesimal gauge invariance of the theory. einsteins theory is the only non-
trivial solution of this identity.
in quantum theory the problem was studied by
boulware and deser [2]. these authors implement gauge invariance by requireing
ward identities associated with the graviton propagator. all authors get einsteins
theory as the unique classical limit if the theory is purely spin two without a spin
one admixture.

in this paper we shall study the problem by means of perturbative quantum
gauge invariance. this method which was worked out for spin-1 non-abelian gauge
theories (massless [1] and massive [7]) in last years proceeds as follows: first one
denes innitesimal gauge variations on free elds. in the case of tensor elds it
looks like (1.7) where u(x), instead of being an arbitrary function, is now a fermi
eld which satises the wave equation. u(x) may be regarded as a free fadeev-
popov ghost eld. then we write down the most general trilinear coupling t1
between the graviton and ghost elds which is compatible with lorentz covariance,
power counting and certain basic properties (like zero ghost number). next we
impose rst order gauge invariance which strongly restricts the form of t1. among
the possible solutions we recover einsteins theory l1
eh. the general solution can be
written as a linear combination of l1
eh and divergences as well as coboundaries. in
the perturbative construction of the s-matrix we next have to calculate the time-
ordered product t{t1(x)t1(y)} = t2(x, y) by means of causality [8, 19]. then
schorn [20] has shown that second order gauge invariance gives further restrictions,
in particular, in the case of gravity it requires quartic normalisation terms of the
form l2
eh in the above expansion (1.4). in this way the so-called proliferation of
couplings can be overcome by perturbative gauge invariance.

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section we introduce perturbative
gauge invariance. in section three we set up the general theory of a symmetrical
tensor eld by writing down all possible trilinear self-couplings and the most general
ghost-coupling. in the following sections the consequences of rst order gauge in-
variance are analysed. we obtain 15 important conditions for spin-2 gauge theories.
these conditions are necessary and sucient for rst order gauge invariance.

2. perturbative gauge invariance

our fundamental free asymptotic elds are a symmetric tensor eld of rank two
h(x) and ghost and anti-ghost elds u(x) and u(x). we consider these elds
in the background of minkowski spacetime. a symmetrical tensor eld has ten
degrees of freedom, which are more than the ve independent components of a
spin-2 eld. the additional degrees of freedom can be eliminated by imposing two
further conditions [18], namely

h (x), = 0

and h

(x) = 0

(2.1)

they are disregarded in the construction of the gauge theory and must be considered
later in the characterization of physical states [11].

our tensor eld h (x) will be quantised as a massless eld as follows

(cid:2)h(x), h (y)(cid:3) = ibd0(x  y)

(2.2)

spin-2 gauge theories and perturbative gauge invariance

where d0(x  y) is the massless pauli-jordan distribution and the tensor b is
constructed from the minkowski metric  in the following way

in analogy to spin-1 theories one introduces a gauge charge operator by

b =

1

2(cid:0) +     (cid:1)
q := z


0ud3x

h(x),

(2.3)

(2.4)

x0=t

for the construction of the physical subspace and in order to prove the unitarity
of the s-matrix we want to have a nilpotent operator q. therefore we have to
quantise the ghost elds with anticommutators

{u(x), u (y)} = i d0(x  y)

(2.5)

and all other anti-commutators vanishing. all asymptotic elds full the wave
equation

2 h(x) = 0
2 u(x) = 0
2 u(x) = 0

the gauge charge q (2.4) denes a gauge variation by
dqf := qf  (1)ng (f )f q

(2.6)

(2.7)

where ng is the ghostnumber. this is the number of ghost elds minus the number
of anti-ghost elds in the wick monomial f . the operator dq obeys the leibniz
rule

dq(ab) = (dqa)b + (1)ng (a)adqb

(2.8)

where a and b are arbitrary operators. we obtain the following gauge variations
of the fundamental elds:

i

2(cid:0)u

, + u

,(cid:1)
,   u

dqh = 

dqh = iu
,
dq u = ih
,
dqu = 0

from (2.9) we immediately see

dqh

, = 0

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

the result (2.9) agrees with the innitesimal gauge transformations of the goldberg
variables, so that our choice of q corresponds to the classical framework described in
the introduction. the asymptotic elds will be used to construct the time-ordered
products tn in the adiabatically switched s-matrix

s(g) = 1 +

1

n!z tn(x1, . . . , xn)g(x1) . . . g(xn) d4x1 . . . d4xn

xn=1

(2.14)

where g  s(r4) is a test function. the time ordered products tn are operator
valued distributions and can be expressed by normally ordered products of free
elds. it is very important that gauge invariance of the s-matrix can be directly
formulated in terms of the tn. first order gauge invariance means that dqt1 is a
divergence in the sense of vector analysis, i.e.

dqt1(x) = it 

1/1(x)

3. structure of the interaction

here we introduce the self-couplings of the quantum tensor eld. we consider
for this purpose a symmetrical rank-2 tensor eld in a xed background, namely
minkowski spacetime. the simplest expression leading to a self-interacting spin-2
eld theory is a trilinear coupling of the quantum elds h (x) and h(x)  h
(x).
we require lorentz invariance and in addition to that two derivatives acting on the
elds. this is for the following reasons: first of all, by inspection of all trilinear
self-interaction terms without derivatives, it is easily seen that such a theory cannot
be gauge invariant to rst order of perturbation theory. therefore an interaction
without derivatives can be ruled out. secondly it is impossible to form a lorentz-
scalar from three rank-2 tensor elds with only one derivative. last but not least
the corresponding trilinear expression in the expansion the e-h action contains two
derivatives as well. therefore we are able to reproduce the results from classical
general relativity.

in the following all elds are free elds obeying the free eld equations of motion.
all products of two or more elds at the same spacetime point x are viewed as
normal products. then the general ansatz for a combination of three eld operators
contains 12 terms1:

t h
1 (x) := a1 : h (x),h(x), h(x) : + a2 : h(x)h(x),h(x), :

+ a3 : h(x),h(x),h(x) : + a4 : h(x),h(x)h(x), :
+ a5 : h(x)h(x),h(x), : + a6 : h(x),h(x),h(x) :
+ a7 : h (x),h(x),h(x) : + a8 : h (x)h(x),h(x), :
+ a9 : h (x),h(x),h(x) : + a10 : h (x),h(x)h (x), :
+ a11 : h (x)h(x),h(x), : + a12 : h (x)h(x),h(x), :

(3.1)

here we have omitted all terms which are gauge invariant in a trivial way. these
are terms with a contraction on the two derivatives, e.g. h(x),h(x),h(x) =

1/2 (cid:0)h(x),h(x)h(x)(cid:1). furthermore all terms with two derivatives acting on the

same eld can be transformed into a divergence plus a term already contained in
(3.1). these terms would modify our ansatz only in a redenition of some param-
eters ai and can be omitted without losing generality.

as in the cases of yang-mills theory [5, 6] and einstein gravity [20] we expect to
get a gauge invariant rst order coupling only if we couple the tensor eld h to

1we use the following convention regarding the indices. all vector- and tensor indices are
written as superscript, whereas all partial derivatives are written as subscript in the abbreviated
form with a prime in front of the index, i.e.: a(x), = a(x)/x . all indices will be raised and
lowered by the minkowski-metric  and will be properly contracted like ab :=  ab .

ghost and anti-ghost elds. the most general expression with zero ghost-number is

t u
1 (x) := b1 : u(x), u(x),h (x) : + b2 : u(x), u(x)h (x), :

+ b3 : u(x)u(x), h(x), : + b4 : u(x), u(x),h (x) :
+ b5 : u(x), u(x)h (x), : + b6 : u(x)u(x),h (x), :
+ b7 : u(x), u(x),h(x) : + b8 : u(x), u(x)h(x), :
+ b9 : u(x)u(x),h(x), : + b10 : u(x), u(x),h(x) :
+ b11 : u(x), u(x)h(x), : + b12 : u(x)u(x),h(x), :
+ b13 : u(x), u(x), h(x) : + b14 : u(x), u(x)h (x), :
+ b15 : u(x)u(x),h (x), : + b16 : u(x), u(x),h (x) :
+ b17 : u(x), u(x)h (x), : + b18 : u(x)u(x),h (x), :
+ b19 : u(x), u(x),h(x) : + b20 : u(x), u(x)h (x), :
+ b21 : u(x)u(x), h(x), :

(3.2)

we will suppress all arguments of the eld operators as well as the double dots of
normal ordering in subsequent expressions. the complete rst order coupling is
then given by:

t1 := t h

1 + t u
1

(3.3)

in the following analysis we are interested in the question how the parameters of
the theory a1, . . . , a12 and b1, . . . , b21 will be restricted due to rst order gauge
invariance.

4.1. ansatz for a divergence. in the previous section we have dened our tri-
linear coupling t h
1 . in
this section we try to write the gauge variation dqt1 as a divergence t 
1/1. we
proceed in the following way: because of the great variety of dierent terms in
dqt1 it is most convenient to use a separate ansatz for t 
1/1. since the operator dq
applied to our t1 increases the ghostnumber of the result by one we have to make
an ansatz with ng(t 
1/1) = 1. the terms appearing in this ansatz can be classied
according to their index structure regarding the tensor indices: there are seven
dierent types of the form uhh, namely

the parameters c1, . . . , c114  c are for the moment free constants, to be deter-
mined by gauge invariance. this expression2 for t 
1/1 contains all possible combi-
nations of elds appearing after gauge variation of t1. without losing generality
one can now eliminate a few terms in the types a, . . . , d, h and k 3. therefore we

1/1. after elimination of these
redundant terms in the types a, . . . , d, h and k one can express the corresponding
terms of dqt1 in an unique way as a divergence in the sense of vector analysis. this
is done in appendix a. for the types e, f, g and j the situation is a little dierent.
here we have no monomial with two derivatives, one of which acting with respect

2t 

1/1 is called q-vertex in the sequel because it is obtained from the usual vertex t1 if one

replaces a quantum eld with the gauge variation of that eld.

to x. for these types it is impossible to obtain an unique divergence for dqt1, see
appendix b. nevertheless these types are important for the following, as we will
see. let us look at type e rst.

explicitly. from the comparison of these divergences with dqt1|t ypee we will get

finally we arrive at the divergence form if we invert the system (4.19). this is done
in appendix b. let me  m at(18 15, z) be the coecient matrix of (4.19). then
we can write this system of equations as

me  ce = de

(4.21)

where ce  c15 and de  c18 are the column vectors with components (c39, . . . , c53)
and (d29, . . . , d46) respectively. now we observe two things:

from 2. we get the information that the representation of dqt1|t ypee as a di-
vergence is not unique. but the important results are the equations (4.22), because
we obtain relations among the coupling parameters if we use (4.20):

together with the six relations from type e (4.234.28) we get 15 independent
equations which restrict the admissible theories. by construction these equations
are necessary for a spin-2 theory to be gauge invariant.

4.4. nilpotency of q. the gauge charge operator is by denition nilpotent (q2 =
0). as a consequence the application of twice the gauge variation to every expression
must vanish, i.e.

(dq)2t1(x) = 0

(4.38)

10

g unter scharf and mark wellmann

if we now use the gauge invariance of t1 to rst order, we get additional constraints
for the q-vertex t 

1/1, namely

dq(cid:16)x

t 

1/1(x)(cid:17) = 0

(4.39)

this equation gives us restrictions on the parameters of t 
1/1. after a lengthy
calculation one arrives at exactly 63 linear independent coecients. the remaining
ones can be expressed as linear combinations of them. one might think that these
linear dependences may produce further necessary conditions beside the fteen
above. but this is not the case. the divergence expressions become larger if we
restrict ourself to these 63 independent parameters since terms of dierent types
mix up. in view of this it is more convenient to work with the full 100 dierent
parameters but type by type separately. the equation (4.39) is always satised as
soon as gauge invariance to rst order holds.

5. gauge invariant spin-2 theories

the preceding section has shown what kind of restrictions we obtain if we require
the theory to be gauge invariant. the 15 equations (4.234.37) we have found for
the 33 parameters a1, . . . , a12 as well as b1, . . . , b21 play a central role. now we
can look at an arbitrary solution to this set of equations. the corresponding t1
is then gauge invariant to rst order because for the following reason. we have to
write the gauge variation of this t1 as a divergence in the sense of vector analysis.
because of the generality of our ansatz for the q-vertex every term in dqt1 can
1/1. with the help of the equations
from appendix a we can then nd a unique divergence for the types a, b, c, d, h
and k. for the other types we can also nd a divergence but in this case its no
longer unique (see appendix b).

then we have the two equivalent statements:

this proposition determines all gauge invariant spin-2 theories up to rst order

e-h action by l(0, 1,1,1, 0, . . . , 0

namely

(5.2)

from the viewpoint of gauge properties of a quantised tensor eld we have obtained
a set of 18 linear independent gauge theories. we claim that these 18 dierent
theories together with all their linear combinations are physically equivalent (in
the sense explained below) to the trilinear coupling of einstein-hilbert (5.1) plus
the ghost coupling of kugo-ojima (5.2) up to rst order of perturbation theory.
let pphys be the projection from the hole fock-space f onto the physical subspace
fphys, which can be expressed in terms of the kernel and the range of the gauge
charge operator q by

fphys = ker q/ran q

(5.3)
(see e.g. [15, 12]). then two s-matrices s, s describe the same physics if all matrix
elements between physical states agree in the adiabatic limit g  1, i.e.
(, pphyss(g)pphys), ,   f

(, pphyss(g)pphys) = lim
g1

lim
g1

(5.4)

for theories with massless elds the existence of the adiabatic limit is a problem.
to avoid this we work with a perturbative version of (5.4):

pphystnpphys  pphyst 

npphys = divergences

(5.5)

obviously (5.5) for all n implies (5.4) if the adiabatic limit exists. specialising to
rst order n = 1 we see that two couplings t1 and t 
1 which dier by a divergence
are physically equivalent to rst order. furthermore, if they dier by a coboundary,
i.e. a term

(5.6)
where x has ghostnumber ng(x) = 1, they are also equivalent because of the
equation

t cb
1 = dqx

pphys(dqx)pphys = pphysqxpphys + pphysxqpphys = 0

(5.7)

since by inspection of (5.3) we have

qpphys = 0 = pphysq

(5.8)

let us return to the space of solutions v from proposition 1. every vector in v
corresponds through the mapping f 1 to a gauge invariant theory to rst order of
perturbation theory. as was mentioned earlier the trilinear coupling of einstein-
hilbert lies in this space. we now look at the other theories beside the e-h coupling.
for this purpose we choose a suitable basis in v . it turns out that a basis can be
choosen which shows that all theories beside the classical e-h coupling consists of
divergences and coboundaries only. then we have the following theorem.

12

g unter scharf and mark wellmann

proposition 2. up to rst order of perturbation theory all gauge invariant trilin-
ear self-couplings of a quantised tensor eld h(x) are physically equivalent to the
one obtained from the expansion of the einstein-hilbert lagrangian (given by (5.1)
without the two divergence terms, see [20]).

the proof of this proposition is given in appendix c.
now there arise two questions: 1) will the statement of this proposition remain
true in higher orders? to answer this question we have to show that in each order
n we can achieve the form

tn = t eh

(5.9)
where t eh
, j = 1, . . . , n 1 only. we are quite sure
that this is indeed the case so the divergence- or coboundary contributions will have
no physical eect. this will be further investigated in a forthcomming paper.

n will be constructed from t eh

n + dq(xn) + divergences

j

2) what about the gauge invariance of the einstein-hilbert coupling in higher
orders? in [20] schorn obtained the result that the e-h coupling in combination
with the kugo-ojima-coupling for the ghosts is gauge invariant to second order.
there it was necessary to introduce normalisation terms which coincide with the
four graviton coupling obtained from the expansion of the e-h lagrangian. higher
than second order have not been investigated up to now.

6. discussion and outlook

in this work we have given a detailed analysis of the gauge properties of a quan-
tised tensor eld. very strong restrictions on the admissible form of the interaction
are obtained through the requirement of perturbative gauge invariance even in rst
order of perturbation theory. among all solutions to our set of equations only the
e-h coupling remains as a physically relevant theory. this fact is very remarkable
since in our approach only the gauge properties of a quantum eld describing a
spin-2 particle were considered and no use was made of any geometrical input from
classical general relativity. in view of this and with the preceding work about yang-
mills theories in mind we have seen that the principle of operator gauge invariance
is a really universal.

in the future we will analyze the einstein-hilbert coupling in higher orders of
perturbation theory. first of all we will work out a proof of proposition 2 in
higher orders which seems possible to us without to many diculties. then we are
interested in a detailed analysis of the second order gauge invariance for the e-h
coupling. although this was already done by schorn who has found that the second
order is indeed gauge invariant, we hope that we can give a more straightforward
proof of this result which can be generalized to higher orders. we also plan to
consider other non-at backgrounds.

in the subsequent appendices a and b we give the explicit divergence forms for

the various types of dqt1. the proof of proposition 2 is outlined in appendix c.

appendix b. divergences for types e, f, g and j

here we calculate the explicit divergence forms in terms of the coupling param-
eters a1, . . . , a12, b1, . . . , b21 for the types e, f, g and j. in contrast to the other
types the system of equations between the ci and dj are no longer invertible in a
unique way. there are some ambiguities, if we express the ci in terms of the dj .
let us begin with type e.

1.) type e: let me  m at(18  15, z) the coecient matrix of the system

the matrix me has rank(me) = 12. so there are three free parameters 1, 2, 3

it should be noted that there is no possibility to write veh in the form (c.1).
then the theorem is proven because all basis vectors except veh have a form which
lead to unphysical s-matrix elements. together with the discussion preceeding the
proposition 2 in section 5 we can now argue that the only physically relevant theory
is the coupling of einstein-hilbert.
