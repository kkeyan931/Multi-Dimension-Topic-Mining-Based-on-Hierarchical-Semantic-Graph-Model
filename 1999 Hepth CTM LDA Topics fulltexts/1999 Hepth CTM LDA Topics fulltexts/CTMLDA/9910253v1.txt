abstract

we derive a formula that expresses the local spin and eld opera-
tors of fundamental graded models in terms of the elements of the
monodromy matrix. this formula is a quantum analogue of the
classical inverse scattering transform. it applies to fundamental
spin chains, such as the xyz chain, and to a number of important
exactly solvable models of strongly correlated electrons, such as
the supersymmetric t-j model or the the eks model.

introduction

the quantum inverse scattering method was initiated some twenty years ago
by e. k. sklyanin and l. d. faddeev [1, 2] and then mostly developed by the
group of the steklov mathematical institute at leningrad (cf, for instance,
[3, 4, 5, 6]). a pedagogical account of its most important aspects can be
found in [7].

the quantum inverse scattering method got its name, since it arose as
an attempt to develop a quantum version of the (classical) inverse scatter-
ing method [8, 9], which was successful in solving non-linear classical evolu-
tion equations, such as the korteweg-de-vries equation [10], the non-linear
schrodinger equation [11] or the sine-gordon equation [12].

the classical inverse scattering method provides a mapping from a set of
eld variables satisfying non-linear evolution equations to a set of scattering
data of an associated auxiliary problem. while the elds obey non-linear
evolution equations, the scattering data evolve linearly in time. the solution
of the initial value problem for the original non-linear evolution equations of
the elds is achieved by rst mapping the initial data to the scattering data
at time t = 0, then using the linear time evolution of the scattering data,
and nally applying the inverse transformation [13, 14] from scattering data
to elds at a time t > 0.

in this paper we solve the inverse scattering problem for quantum lattice

models. the solution is remarkably simple.

nowadays the term quantum inverse scattering method usually refers to
a method formulated for systems of nite length. the relation to the classical
case is the following. the elements of the monodromy matrix, which appears
in the formulation of the classical problem for systems of nite length, have
simple poisson brackets [4]. in the quantum case the poisson brackets are
replaced by commutators of quantum operators. these commutators remain
simple after quantization. the quantum operators can be grouped into a
matrix, which, by analogy to the classical case, is called (quantum) mon-
odromy matrix. the elements of the quantum monodromy matrix obey a
set of quadratic relations. they generate the so-called yang-baxter alge-
bra. the structure of this algebra is determined by numerical functions of a
complex spectral parameter, which again can be arranged in a matrix. this
matrix is called the r-matrix. it satises the famous yang-baxter equation
(see (40) below). the r-matrix and its associated yang-baxter algebra are
the key concepts of the quantum inverse scattering method. these concepts

3

are algebraic.

the yang-baxter algebra has two primary applications. first of all, it
contains, in general, a rich commutative subalgebra generated by the trace of
the monodromy matrix. the elements of this subalgebra have a natural in-
terpretation as a set of commuting quantities belonging to a physical system.
one of these quantities is interpreted as the hamiltonian. the existence of a
large set of commuting operators can not be directly utilized to diagonalize
the hamiltonian. in many cases, however, the yang-baxter algebra can be
employed for this task. it can be used to simultaneously diagonalize all of
the commuting quantities by a procedure called the algebraic bethe ansatz
[3]. this is the most important application of the yang-baxter algebra.

inspite of the conceptual dierences between classical and quantum in-
verse scattering method, both methods have an important point in common.
they essentially rely on a mapping from local eld variables to a set of non-
local variables, which are the elements of the monodromy matrix.
in the
quantum case the inverse transformation, expressing the local elds in terms
of the elements of the monodromy matrix, was not known until recently. it
rst appeared in the examples of the inhomogeneous xxx and xxz spin- 1
2
heisenberg chains in the article [15].

the article [15] is part of a series of articles [16, 15, 17, 18] by izergin,
kitanine, maillet, sanches de santos and terras.
in this series an inter-
esting new device, the factorizing f -matrix [16] was introduced into the
algebraic bethe ansatz and its features were explored. this led to simplied
derivations of a number of important results for the xxx and xxz spin- 1
2
chains. among the rederived results are the norm formulae [19, 20] and the
slavnov formula [21] for the scalar product of a bethe ansatz eigenstate with
a non-eigenstate. the articles [15, 17, 18] also provide simplied derivations
of various results for form factors [22] and correlation functions [23, 24, 25]
and their generalization to the case of non-zero magnetic eld.

from our point of view, the most interesting new result in [16, 15, 17, 18]
is the solution of the quantum inverse problem for the periodic,and inho-
mogeneous xxx and xxz spin- 1
2 heisenberg chains (cf [15]). this result
appeared to be the most important new tool used in the rederivation of the
determinant formulae for form factors [15] and in the derivation of multiple
integral representations of correlation functions at nite magnetic eld [18].

in this article we shall focus on the quantum inverse problem. we shall

4

obtain an explicit solution, which is valid (i) in the homogeneous case, (ii)
for models with r-matrices of arbitrary higher dimension, and (iii), most
generally, for fundamental graded models [26]. upon specication to the
cases of the inhomogeneous xxx and xxz spin- 1
2 heisenberg chains our
result reduces to the formula obtained in [15].

our result in its most general form is given by the formula (86) below.
this formula is valid for homogeneous as well as for inhomogeneous mod-
els. important special cases considered in this article are the solution of the
quantum inverse problem for the translationally invariant xyz spin chain
(cf equations (17)-(19) in section 1) and for the inhomogeneous t-j model
(equations (91)-(98) in section 6).

formula (86) expresses the local operators as products of the entries of
the monodromy matrix evaluated at the inhomogeneities. the structure of
the solution of the quantum inverse problem for periodic lattice models is
thus much dierent from the structure of the solution of the classical inverse
scattering problem. in the quantum case we have an explicit multiplicative
formula. in the classical case the solution is implicit and additive. it reduces
to the gelfand-levitan-marchenko integral equations [13, 14].

the article is organized as follows. in section 1 we present the solution of
the quantum inverse problem for the homogeneous xyz spin- 1
2 chain. later
this solution will appear as a special case of our general solution (86). we
treat the case of the xyz chain separately, since the proof greatly simplies in
the homogeneous case. in section 2 we remind to the reader the denitions of
graded vector spaces and graded associative algebras. we introduce the no-
tion of graded local projection operators which were recently dened in [26].
section 3 reviews the construction of the yang-baxter algebra for fundamen-
tal graded models [26] and some important results about the graded version of
the quantum inverse scattering method [5, 27, 26]. in section 4 we introduce
canonical fermi operators into the formalism. in section 5 we illustrate the
abstract formalism developed in the preceding section through two examples
which are important in physical applications. we consider the small polaron
model [28] and the supersymmetric t-j model [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].
in section 6 we present our main result (86) in its most general form, valid for
inhomogeneous, fundamental graded models associated with r-matrices of
arbitrary dimension. we specify our formula for the examples considered in

the proof of [15] does not work in the homogeneous case, since the f -matrices are

not invertible for homogeneous lattices.

5

section 5 and work out its homogeneous limit. in section 7 we give a general
denition of the fermionic r-operator associated with a fundamental graded
representation of the yang-baxter algebra. a fermionic r-operator was re-
cently introduced in [37, 38] for a number of models important in physical
applications. the fermionic r-operator is one of the tools we shall need for
the proof of the solution (86) of the quantum inverse problem. section 8 is
devoted to this proof. we construct the shift operator for inhomogeneous,
fundamental graded models and work out its properties. our proof of the
quantum invers problem solely relies on the properties of the shift operator.
in particular, we do not use factorizing f -matrices (which are so far known
only for the xxx and xxz spin- 1
2 chains) as in the article [15]. this makes
our approach more general and powerful. our article is concluded with a
brief summary and a discussion of our new formulae.

1 solution of the quantum inverse problem

for the xyz chain

in this section we shall start solving the quantum inverse problem for fun-
damental models by considering an important example. the result of this
section will later appear as a special case of our main result, equation (86).
we think, however, that the structure of our main result and of its proof
is best understood by considering an example rst. we shall assume that
the reader is familiar with the basic ideas of the quantum inverse scatter-
ing method. readers not familiar with those ideas are referred to section 3,
where a brief review is provided.

the xyz spin- 1

in a normalization, which assures the unitarity of the r-matrix (cf (85)), the

boltzmann weights a(u), . . . , d(u) are given by

a(u) =

,

d(u) =

sn(u) + sn(2)

(2)

.

the r-matrix r(u) is considered as acting on the tensor product c2  c2.
r(u, v) := r(u  v) is a solution of the yang-baxter equation (40) (see
below). hence, an exactly solvable spin chain can be associated with r(u).
let us briey recall the steps necessary for its construction.

the set {e

and have the meaning of local projection operators. using the r-matrix (1)
and the local projection operators we can dene the l-matrix at site j as

7

monodromy matrix of the corresponding homogeneous spin chain is the l-
fold ordered product

t (u) = ll(u) . . . l1(u)

.

(7)

by construction the monodromy matrix gives a representation of the yang-
baxter algebra with r-matrix r(u) (see section 3 below). we have

p r(u  v)(cid:0)t (u)  t (v)(cid:1) =(cid:0)t (v)  t (u)(cid:1)p r(u  v)

where p =p2

 is the permutation matrix on c2  c2. the yang-
baxter algebra (8) is the basis for the solution of the xyz chain by algebraic
bethe ansatz [3].

(8)

the monodromy matrix (7) is a 22 matrix in auxiliary space. its entries
are non-local operators acting on the space of states of the xyz chain. we
may write the monodromy matrix as

a(u) b(u)

c(u) d(u)
t (u) =
 .


the quantum inverse problem is to express the local operators en
of the elements a(u), . . . , d(u) of the monodromy matrix.

(9)


 in terms

for the case at hand this problem is rather easily solved. note that

a(0) = c(0) = 1 and b(0) = d(0) = 0. it follows from (6) that

.

(10)

here p0j is the permutation operator that interchanges the auxiliary space

 interchanges
the j-th and k-th quantum spaces. using equation (10) in equation (7) we
obtain

with the j-th quantum space. similarly, pjk = p2

ek

t (0) = p0lp0l1 . . . p01 = p01p1lp1l1 . . . p12 = p01 u .

(11)

here u = p1lp1l1 . . . p12 = p12p23 . . . pl1l is the cyclic shift operator in
quantum space. in the second equation in (11) we have used the commutation

8

relation pjkpjl = pklpjk for permutation operators. let us write equation
(11) in matrix form,

a(0) b(0)


c(0) d(0)

comparing the matrix elements we nd the relations

u = a(0) + d(0)

,


1 = e1

2 = b(0) u 1

.

these relations constitute a solution of the quantum inverse problem for
the local operators acting on the rst lattice site. we may now simply use
the shift operator to shift the site indices. since u n1e1

 and
u l = id, we obtain

u 1n = en




(12)

(13)

(14)

(16)

n = u n1b(0) u ln


n = u n1c(0) u ln

n = u n1(cid:0)a(0)  d(0)(cid:1) u ln

(17)

(18)

(19)

.

taking into account equation (13) we see that the right hand side of the
equations (17)-(19) are entirely expressed in terms of the entries of the mon-
odromy matrix. an alternative way of writing (17)-(19) is

en



 = u n1 t 

 (0) u ln =(cid:0)a(0) + d(0)(cid:1)n1 t 

 (0)(cid:0)a(0) + d(0)(cid:1)ln

.
(20)

equation (20) allows us to calculate expectation values of local operators by
means of the yang-baxter algebra.

the remainder of this article will be devoted to the generalization of equa-
tion (20) to (i) arbitrary dimension of the r-matrix, (ii) the inhomogeneous
case, and (iii) to fundamental graded models. it is important noting that
our above solution of the quantum inverse problem does not depend on the
specic features of the xyz chain. our calculation solely relied on the fact
that the l-matrix evaluated at u = 0 turns into a permutation operator (cf
equation (10)).

2 graded vector spaces

in this section we shall recall the basic concepts of graded vector spaces and
graded associative algebras. in the context of the quantum inverse scatter-
ing method these concepts were rst used by kulish and sklyanin [5, 27].
we shall further recall the notions of graded local projection operators and
graded permutation operators. graded local projection operators were intro-
duced in the article [26]. they enable the denition of fundamental graded
representations of the yang-baxter algebra, which will be given in the fol-
lowing section.

graded vector spaces are vector spaces equipped with a notion of odd and
even, that allows us to treat fermions within the formalism of the quantum
inverse scattering method. let us start with a nite dimensional local space
of states v , on which we impose an additional structure, the parity, from
the outset. let v = v0  v1, dim v0 = m, dim v1 = n. we shall call
v0  v0 even and v1  v1 odd. the subspaces v0 and v1 are called the
homogeneous components of v . the parity p is a function vi  z2 dened
on the homogeneous components of v ,

p(vi) = i

,

i = 0, 1 ,

vi  vi

.

(21)

the vector space v endowed with this structure is called a graded vector
space or super space. let us x a basis {e1, . . . , em+n} of denite parity and
let us dene p() := p(e).

the use of graded vector spaces within the quantum inverse scattering
method requires the construction of an algebra of commuting and anticom-
muting operators. for this purpose we have to extend the concept of par-
ity to operators in end(v ) and to tensor products of these operators. let
e
  end(v ), e
  end(v )|,  = 1, . . . m + n} is a
basis of end(v ). hence, the denition

 e. the set {e

e = 

p(e

) = p() + p()

(22)

induces a grading on end(v ) regarded as a vector space.

it is easy to see that an element a = a

e

  end(v ) is homogeneous

with parity p(a), if and only if

(1)p()+p()a

 = (1)p(a)a



.

(23)

10

the latter equation implies for two homogeneous elements a, b  end(v )
that their product ab is homogeneous with parity

p(ab) = p(a) + p(b)

.

(24)

in other words, multiplication of matrices in end(v ) preserves homogeneity,
and, therefore, end(v ) endowed with the grading (22) is a graded associative
algebra [5].

let us consider the l-fold tensorial power (end(v ))l of end(v ). the

denition (22) has a natural extension to (end(v ))l, namely,

p(e1

1      el

l) = p(1) + p(1) +    + p(l) + p(l)

.

(25)

from this formula it can be seen in a similar way as before, that homogeneous
elements a = a1...l
l of (end(v ))l with parity p(a) are
1...l
characterized by the equation

e1
1      el

(1)pl

j=1(p(j )+p(j))a1...l
1...l

= (1)p(a)a1...l
1...l

,

(26)

which generalizes (23). again the product ab is homogeneous with parity
p(ab) = p(a) + p(b), if a and b are homogeneous. thus the denition (25)
induces the structure of a graded associative algebra on (end(v ))l.

let us dene the super-bracket

[x, y ] = xy  (1)p(x)p(y )y x

(27)

for x, y taken from the homogeneous components of end(v ), and let us
extend it linearly to end(v ) in both of its arguments. then, end(v ) endowed
with the super-bracket becomes the lie-super algebra gl(m|n). note that the
above denition of a super-bracket makes sense in any graded algebra and is
particularly valid in (end(v ))l.

the following denition of graded local projection operators [26] will
be crucial for our denition of fundamental graded representations of the
yang-baxter algebra in the next section. dene the matrices

ej



 = (1)(p()+p())pl

k=j+1 p(k) i (j1)

m+n  e

  ej+1

j+1      el
l

,

(28)

where im+n is the (m + n)  (m + n) unit matrix, and summation over double
tensor indices (i.e. over j+1, . . . , l) is understood. we shall keep this sum
convention throughout the remainder of this article. the index j on the left

11

hand side of (28) will later refer to the j-th site of a physical lattice model
and is called the site index. a simple consequence of the denition (28) for
j 6= k are the commutation relations

ej


ek



 = (1)(p()+p())(p()+p())ek


ej




.

(29)

it further follows from equation (28) that ej


 is homogeneous with parity

p(ej


) = p() + p()

.

(30)

hence, in agreement with intuition, equation (29) says that odd matrices with
dierent site indices mutually anticommute, whereas even matrices commute
with each other as well as with the odd matrices. for products of matrices
ej


 which are acting on the same site (28) implies the projection property

ej


ej



 = 

 ej




.

(31)


equations (29) and (31) justify our terminology. the ej
 are graded ana-
logues of local projection operators. we call them graded local projection
operators or projection operators, for short. using the super-bracket (27),
equations (29) and (31) can be combined into

 ej



  (1)(p()+p())(p()+p())

ej

(32)



(cid:17) .

[ej


, ek



] = jk(cid:16)

the right hand side of the latter equation with j = k gives the structure
constants of the lie super algebra gl(m|n) with respect to the basis {ej


}.

since any m + n-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers is
isomorphic to cm+n, we may simply set v = cm+n. we may further assume
that our homogeneous basis {e  cm+n| = 1, . . . , m + n} is canonical, i.e.
we may represent the vector e by a column vector having the only non-zero
entry +1 in row . our basic matrices e
 are then (m+n)(m+n)-matrices

remark. the meaning of (28) becomes more evident by considering a sim-
ple example. let m = n = 1 and p(1) = 0, p(2) = 1. then, using (32), we

this is the well-known jordan-wigner transformation [41] expressing fermi
operators for spinless fermions in terms of pauli matrices. we may thus inter-
pret equation (28) as a generalization of the jordan-wigner transformation.
in general, equation (28) provides matrix representations not of fermi oper-
ators but, more generally, of fermionic projection operators. representations
of fermi operators can be obtained be taking appropriate linear combinations

of matrices ej
. this point will be elaborated in section 4 below. note that an
alternative generalization of the jordan-wigner transformation, which relies
on representations of the cliord algebra, was recently introduced in [42].

the permutation operator plays an important role in the construction of
local integrable lattice models. it enters the expression for the shift operator
on homogeneous lattices and the expression for the hamiltonian of rational
gl(m|n) invariant models (see section 5 below). in the graded case the def-
inition of the permutation operator requires the following modications of
signs,

pjk = (1)p()ej


ek




.

(38)

as indicated by its name, this operator induces the action of the symmetric
group sl on the site indices of the matrices ej

. the properties of pjk (for
j 6= k) are the same as in the non-graded case. they are easily derived from
(29) and (31) and can be found, for instance, in [26]. let l = 2. then

p12 = (1)p()e1


e2



 = (1)p()p()e

  e

 = (1)p()p()

 

 e

  e



.
(39)

from the right hand side of this equation we can read o the matrix elements
of p12 with respect to the canonical basis of end(v  v ).

3 fundamental graded models

in this section we shall recall the notion of fundamental graded representa-
tions of the yang-baxter algebra, which was recently introduced in [26]. for
a given grading we shall associate a fundamental model with every solution
of the yang-baxter equation that satises a certain compatibility condition
(see (41) below).

for our present purpose it is most suitable to interpret the yang-baxter
equation as a set of functional equations for the matrix elements of an (m +
n)2  (m + n)2-matrix r(u, v). we may represent the yang-baxter equation
in graphical form as shown in figure 1, where each vertex corresponds to a
factor in the equation

(u, v)r
r

(u, w)r

(v, w) = r

(v, w)r

(u, w)r

(u, v)

.

(40)

note that there is a direction assigned to every line in gure 1, which is
indicated by the tips of the arrows. therefore every vertex has an orientation,
and vertices and r-matrices can be identied according to gure 2, where
indices have been supplied to a vertex. summation is over all inner lines in
gure 1.

the construction of a graded yang-baxter algebra and its fundamental
representation requires only minimal modications compared to the non-
graded case [7]. let us assume we are given a solution of (40), which is
compatible with the grading in the sense that [5]

r

 (u, v) = (1)p()+p()+p()+p()r

 (u, v)

.

(41)

14

r

 (u, v) =



u

-





v

?



figure 2: identication of the r-matrix with a vertex

dene a graded l-matrix at site j as

lj



 (u, v) = (1)p()p()r

 (u, v)ej




.

(42)

equation (41) implies that the matrix elements of lj(u, v) are of denite
parity,

p(lj


(u, v)) = p() + p()

.

(43)

thus their commutation rules are given by

lj


(u, v)lk



 (w, z) = (1)(p()+p())(p()+p()) lk


 (w, z)lj


 (u, v)

.

(44)

it further follows from the yang-baxter equation (40) and from equation (41)
that

r(u, v)(cid:0)lj(u, w) s lj(v, w)(cid:1) =(cid:0)lj(v, w) s lj(u, w)(cid:1) r(u, v)

as in the non-graded case the matrix r(u, v) is dened by

.

(45)

r

 (u, v) = r

 (u, v)

.

(46)

the super tensor product [5] in equation (45) is to be understood as a su-
per tensor product of matrices with non-commuting entries, (a s b)
 =
(1)(p()+p())p()a
 . the super tensor product has the following impor-
tant feature. given matrices a, b, c, d with operator valued entries, which
mutually commute according to the same rule as lj and lk in equation (44),
we obtain for the product of two super tensor products

b

(a s b)(c s d) = ac s bd .

(47)

15

equation (45) may be interpreted as dening a graded yang-baxter algebra
with r-matrix r. we call lj its fundamental graded representation.

starting from (45) we can construct integrable lattice models as in the
non-graded case [7]. let us briey recall the construction with emphasis
on the modications that appear due to the grading. dene a monodromy
matrix t(u, v) as an l-fold ordered product of fundamental l-matrices,

t(u, v) = ll(u, v) . . . l1(u, v)

.

(48)

due to equation (24) the matrix elements of t(u, v) are homogeneous with
parity p(t
 (u, v)) = p()+p(). repeated application of (45) and (47) shows
that this monodromy matrix is a representation of the graded yang-baxter
algebra,

r(u, v)(cid:0)t(u, w) s t(v, w)(cid:1) =(cid:0)t(v, w) s t(u, w)(cid:1) r(u, v)

in the non-graded case (n = 0) the super tensor product in (49) agrees with
the usual tensor product. let us now dene the super trace as

.

(49)

str(a) = (1)p()a


.

it follows from (41) and (49) that

which is in complete analogy with the non-graded case.

(cid:2)str(t(u, w)), str(t(v, w))(cid:3) = 0 ,

(50)

(51)

let us assume that r(u, v) is a regular solution of the yang-baxter equa-

tion, r

 (v, v) = 

 

 . then (42) implies that

lj



 (v, v) = (1)p()p()ej




,

(52)

and we can easily see [26] that the super trace of the monodromy matrix
evaluated at (v, v) generates a shift by one site,

str(t(v, v)) = p12p23 . . . pl1l =: u .

(53)

it follows that  (u) := i ln(str(t(u, v))) generates a sequence of local oper-
ators [43] which, as a consequence of (51), mutually commute,

 (u) =  + (u  v) h + o(cid:0)(u  v)2(cid:1)

.

(54)

16

 in this expansion is the momentum operator. on a lattice, where the mini-
mal possible shift is by one site, and thus u rather than  is the fundamental
geometrical operator, some care is required in the denition of . as was
shown in [44] a proper denition may be obtained by setting  := i ln( u )
mod 2 and expressing the function f (x) = x mod 2 by its fourier sum.
then  becomes a polynomial in u .

(55)

where  = 2/l. the rst order term h in the expansion (54) may be
interpreted as hamiltonian. using (53) it is obtained as

h =

l

xj=1

hjj+1

,

where hll+1 = hl1 and

hjj+1 = i (1)p()(p()+p()) u r

we would like to draw the readers attention to the following points.
(i) the r-matrix r in equation (45) does not undergo a modication due
to the grading. (ii) the only necessary compatibility condition which has
to be satised in order to introduce a fundamental graded representation
of the yang-baxter algebra associated with a solution of the yang-baxter
equation is equation (41), which was introduced in [5]. equation (41) is a
rather weak constraint. the most important solutions of the yang-baxter
equation, which appear in physical applications are compatible with a non-
trivial grading (see the examples in section 5). moreover, a given r-matrix
may be compatible with dierent gradings, leading to dierent fundamental
graded representations of the yang-baxter algebra [26].

before turning to our next subject let us introduce the inhomogeneous

generalization

t(u; 1, . . . , l) = ll(u, l) . . . l1(u, 1)

(58)

of the monodromy matrix (48). this monodromy matrix satises (49). for
1 =    = l = v it turns into t(u, v) dened in (48). we shall formulate our
main result below for the inhomogeneous model generated by t(u; 1, . . . , l).

4 fermi operators

in the article [26] it was explained how the various graded objects introduced
in the previous section can be expressed in terms of fermi operators. the key

observation is that, as far as the matrices ej
 are concerned, all calculations
of the previous section rely on the commutation relations (29) and on the
projection property (31). fermionic projection operators satisfy the same

equations. we may thus say that the matrices ej
 are matrix representations
of fermionic projection operators. as we have seen in the previous section,

the matrices ej
 are suitable for formulating a graded version of the quantum
inverse scattering method. for the physical interpretation of the models
constructed from a given solution of the yang-baxter equation, however, it
is convenient to introduce fermi operators into the formalism.

a general construction of fermionic projection operators for fermions of
arbitrary su(n) spin was presented in [26]. rather than repeating those
results let us illustrate them by example.

let us consider spinless fermions on a ring of l lattice sites,

{cj, ck} = {c

j, c

k} = 0 ,

{cj, c

k} = jk

,

j, k = 1, . . . , l .

(59)

it is easy to verify that the entries (xj)

 of the matrix

xj =


1  nj

c
j

cj

nj


are fermionic projection operators. dene xj



 = (xj)

. then

xj


xj



 = 

 xj




.

(60)

(61)


the operators xj
 carry parity, induced by the anti commutation rule (59) for

the fermi operators. for j 6= k xj
 anticommute, if both are build
up of an odd number of fermi operators, and otherwise commute. this fact

can be expressed as follows. let p(1) = 0, p(2) = 1 and p(xj
) = p()+p().

then xj
) = 1,

and even, if p(xj
 are
thus


 is odd (contains an odd number of fermi operators), if p(xj


) = 0. the commutation rules for the projectors xj


 and xk

xj


xk



 = (1)(p()+p())(p()+p())xk


xj




.

(62)

18

now (61) and (62) are of the same form as (31) and (29), respectively. since
the calculations in the previous section relied solely on (29) and (31), we may
simply replace ej


 in equations (42) and (57).


  xj

fermionic representations compatible with arbitrary grading can be con-
structed by considering several species of fermions and graded products of
projection operators. we shall explain this for the case of two species. this
is the case most interesting for applications, since we may interpret the two
species as up- and down-spin electrons. we have to attach a spin index to the
fermi operators, cj  cj,  =, , {cj, c
k } = jk . accordingly, there

  x 
are two species of projection operators, xj



j

.

let us dene projection operators for electrons by the tensor products



 = (1)(p()+p())p()x

j

here we used the standard ordering of matrix elements of tensor products,
corresponding to a renumbering (11)  1, (12)  2, (21)  3, (22)  4.

within this convention xj
, ,  = 1, . . . , 4, which then
satises (61) and (62) with grading p(1) = p(4) = 0, p(2) = p(3) = 1.


 is replaced by xj

note that fermi operators can be obtained as linear combinations of

19

projection operators. we have, for instance, cj = xj

2
1 + xj

3.

so far we have considered the case of spinless fermions with two-dimen-
sional local space of states and grading m = n = 1, and the case of electrons
with four-dimensional space of states and grading m = n = 2. there are four
dierent possibilities to realize (29) and (31) in case of a three-dimensional
local space of states, m + n = 3. they can be obtained by deleting the s
row and column of the matrix xj in equation (65),  = 1, 2, 3, 4. (61) and
(62) remain valid, since the operators xj


 are projectors.

an alternative way [45, 46, 42] of introducing fermi operators into the
quantum inverse scattering method is by applying the jordan-wigner trans-
formation [41] to the non-graded l-matrix and then pulling out the non-
local factors. this approach was of primary importance, for instance, for a
fermionic formulation of the yang-baxter algebra of the hubbard model [46]
and led to the discovery of a so(4)-invariant form of the monodromy matrix
of the hubbard model [46, 44, 47]. in general, however, we prefer the method
presented above, since the approach of [45, 46, 42] so far did not lead to gen-
eral formulae such as (42) or (57) and may have unpleasant side eects, such
as a twist of boundary conditions or the appearance of numerous factors of
i in the equations.

5 examples

before turning to our main result let us present several examples in order to
provide an idea to the reader which applications we have in mind.

we shall start with the xxz spin chain. the r-matrix of the xxz spin

chain can, for instance, be written as

r(u, v) =

where




1

0

0

0

0 b(u, v) c(u, v) 0

0 c(u, v) b(u, v) 0

0

0

0

1




,

(66)

b(u, v) =

sh(u  v)

sh(u  v + i)

,

c(u, v) =

sh(i)

sh(u  v + i)

.

(67)

20

the r-matrix (66) is compatible with the grading p(1) = 0, p(2) = 1 (cf
equation (41)). the corresponding l-matrix then follows from (42),

lj(u, v) =


ej

1
1 + b(u, v)ej
c(u, v)ej

2

c(u, v)ej

2

b(u, v)ej

using (56), (57) we obtain the hamiltonian


 .

h =

2(cid:1)o .

(69)

we may now replace the matrices ej
tion (60). then


 by the fermionic projectors xj


, equa-

(1  nj) + b(u, v)nj

c(u, v) cj

c(u, v) c+
j

b(u, v)(1  nj)  nj


(70)

(71)

lj(u, v) =

xj=1(cid:8)c+

l

1

sin()

and

h =

j cj+1 + c+

j+1cj + 2 cos() njnj+1(cid:9) + 2ctg() n ,

where n =pl

j=1 nj is the particle number operator. the hamiltonian (71)
denes the small polaron model [28]. note that the algebraic bethe ansatz
for the small polaron model gets slightly modied compared to the non-
graded spin chain case (p(1) = p(2) = 0), since due to the grading p(1) = 0,
p(2) = 1 there appear certain minus signs in the yang-baxter algebra (49).
our next example is the well known family [27] of graded rational r-

matrices

where

r

 (u, v) = a(u, v)(1)p()p() 

 

 + d(u, v) 

 



,

(72)

a(u, v) =

u  v

u  v + i

,

d(u, v) =

i

u  v + i

.

(73)

r(u, v) solves the yang-baxter equation (40) for arbitrary matrix dimension
n 2  n 2 and arbitrary grading p : {1, . . . , n}  z2.

remark. note the following subtlety. the grading introduced in (72) is

independent of the grading that enters the denition (28) of the matrices ej
.
let q : {1, . . . , n}  z2 arbitrary. then, because of the kronecker deltas in
(72),

21

r

 (u, v) = (1)q()+q()+q()+q() r

 (u, v)

,

(74)

i.e. the compatibility condition (41) is satised for arbitrary p and q. for
example, let n = 2, p(1) = p(2) = 0. then r(u, v) is the r-matrix of
the xxx spin- 1
2 heisenberg chain, which is compatible with the grading
q(1) = 0, q(2) = 1 leading to a special case of the small polaron hamiltonian
introduced above.

let us now elaborate on the case p = q. since a(v, v) = 0 and d(v, v) = 1,

the r-matrix dened in equation (72) is regular. furthermore,

u r

 (u, v)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)u=v

 

= ih

i

  (1)p()p() 

 

.

(75)

thus, using p = q in equations (56) and (57) we nd the hamiltonian

h = 

l

xj=1

(pjj+1  1)

,

(76)

where pjj+1 is the graded permutation operator dened in (38). clearly h
commutes with the generators

e

 =

ej




l

xj=1

(77)

of the graded lie algebra gl(m|n).

the family of hamiltonians (75) based on graded permutations includes a
number of models that are interesting for applications in physics. in the non-
graded case (p() = 0,  = 1, . . . , n) we have the xxx spin- 1
2 chain and its
su(n) generalizations. the case m = 1, n = 2 leads us to the supersymmetric
t-j model [35]. in order to see this we shall employ the fermionization scheme
of the previous section. we start with the set of projectors obtained from
the matrix xj in (65) by deleting its fourth row and column. we obtain the

the entries (xj)
on the local space of states spanned by the basis states |0i, c+
double occupancy is excluded on this space of states. let xj
operator

 of this matrix form a complete set of projection operators
j|0i.

projects the local hilbert space of electrons onto the space with no double
occupancy. the global projection operator for a chain of l sites is given by
the product

 =

(1  njnj)

l

yj=1

.

(80)


the permutation operator pjk is given by equation (38) with xj
 replacing

ej
. the summation in (38) is now over three values, ,  = 1, 2, 3, and the
grading is p(1) = 0, p(2) = p(3) = 1. an elegant way of taking into account
the simplications arising from the restriction to the hilbert space with with
no double occupancy is to consider pjk instead of pjk. since njnj = 0,
we obtain

(pjk  1) = (c

jck + c

kcj)  2(sa

j sa

k  1

4njnk)  (nj + nk) .

here we have introduced the electron density nj = nj + nj and the spin
densities

(81)

j = 1

2 a

c

jcj

.

(82)

the a, a = x, y, z, are the pauli matrices, and we identify 1 with  an 2 with
 in the summation over  and . inserting (81) into the expression (75) for
the hamiltonian we obtain the familiar hamiltonian of the supersymmetric
t-j model [29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36].

let us also write down the corresponding l-matrix, which follows from

equation (42),

lj(u, v) = a(u, v) + d(u, v)

this form of the l-matrix suggests a similar form for the monodromy matrix
of the corresponding inhomogeneous model,

6 solution of the quantum inverse problem

we are now ready to formulate our main result, which is a formula that

expresses the local projection matrices ej
 for fundamental graded models
in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix. we shall assume we
are given a solution of the yang-baxter equation (40) which is regular and
unitary. unitarity means that r(u, v) satises the equation

r

 (u, v)r

(v, u) = 




.

(85)

let p be a grading that is compatible with the r-matrix in the sense of
equation (41), and let t(u) = t(u; 1, . . . , l) be the corresponding inhomo-
geneous monodromy matrix (58). then we have the following formula,

en



 = (1)p()p()

n1

yj=1

str(t(j))  t

(n) 

l

yj=n+1

str(t(j))

.

(86)

equation (86) is our main result. it constitutes a solution of the quantum
inverse problem for fundamental graded models. we shall prove it in the
remaining sections of this article. for m = 2, n = 0 (p(1) = p(2) = 0)
equation (86) reduces to a result recently obtained by kitanine et al. [15].
note that because of (51) no ordering is required for the products on the
right hand side of (86).

24

before proceeding with the proof of (86) let us illustrate the equation
through the examples of the previous section. note that the functions b(u, v),
c(u, v) in (67) and a(u, v), d(u, v) in (73) have been chosen in such a way that
the corresponding r-matrices (66), (72) satisfy the unitarity condition (85).

for the small polaron model the monodromy matrix is of the form

a(u) b(u)

c(u) d(u)
t(u) =

a similar set of equations holds for the local operators of the super-
symmetric t-j model. the monodromy matrix was presented in equation
(84). since the grading is p(1) = 0, p(2) = p(3) = 1, we have str(t(u)) =

on the restricted hilbert space of the supersymmetric t-j model, where dou-
ble occupancy of lattice sites is excluded, the operators on the left hand side
of equations (91)-(94) are appropriate creation and annihilation operators.
the operator (1  nn)c+
n, for instance, creates an up-spin electron on site n,
provided this site is not occupied by a down-spin electron. the local spin op-
erators sa
n in (95)
and (96) are dened as s+
ncn.
these operators induce a local spin ip. the operator (1  nn)(1  nn) on
the left hand side of (98) acts as 1  (nn + nn) on the restricted hilbert
space of the supersymmetric t-j model and thus essentially gives the local
particle number operator.

n (a = x, y, z) were introduced in equation (82). s+
n = sx

n and s
n  isy

ncn and s

n = sx

n + isy

n = c+

n = c+

note that equations (91)-(98) after appropriate replacement of the mon-
odromy matrix also apply to the t-0 model (the innite coupling limit of
the hubbard model below half-lling) which was solved by algebraic bethe
ansatz in [26].

we would like to stress, that our main result, equation (86), also holds
for homogeneous, translationally invariant models, for which j = v = 0,
for j = 1, . . . , l.
in this case (86) takes a particularly simple form, since
str(t(0)) = u, where u is the homogeneous shift operator (53). using this
fact equation (86) turns into

en



 = (1)p()p() u n1t

(0) u ln

.

(99)

performing a similarity transformation with u 1n we obtain the amazingly

26

simple result

e1



 = (1)p()p() t

(0) u 1

,

(100)

which in section 1 was obtained for the special case of the xyz chain. to give
another example, equations (88)-(90), for instance, are in the homogeneous
case equivalent to

1 = b(0) u 1
c+

,

c1 = c(0) u 1

, n1 = d(0) u 1

.

7 the fermionic r-operator

the role of the matrix r(u, v) in the graded yang-baxter algebra (45) is to
switch the order of the two auxiliary spaces. the denition of an operator
that similarly switches the order of quantum spaces in a product of two l-
matrices requires appropriate use of the grading. recently, such an operator
was introduced for several important models by umeno, shiroishi and wadati
[37, 38] and was called fermionic r-operator. here we give a general denition
of the fermionic r-operator associated with a solution r(u, v) of the yang-
baxter equation (40). for a given grading and a solution r(u, v) of the
yang-baxter equation (40) that is compatible with this grading (cf (41)) we
dene

rf

jk(u, v) = (1)p()+p()(p()+p()) r

 (u, v)ej


ek




.

(102)

the fermionic r-operator will be an important tool in the proof of our main
result (86). let us summarize its properties in the following lemma.

lemma 1. properties of the fermionic r-operator.

(i) evenness. the fermionic r-operator is even,

p(rf

jk(u, v)) = 0

.

(ii) bilinear relation. the fermionic r-operator satises
jk(j, k)lk(u, k)lj(u, j) = lj(u, j)lk(u, k)rf

rf

jk(j, k)

(103)

.

(104)

(iii) yang-baxter equation. the fermionic r-operator satises the following

form of the yang-baxter equation,

rf

12(u, v)rf

13(u, w)rf

23(v, w) = rf

23(v, w)rf

13(u, w)rf

12(u, v)

.

(105)

(iv) regularity. if r(u, v) is regular, say r

 (v, v) = 

 

 , then

rf

jk(v, v) = pjk

,

27

(106)

where pjk is the graded permutation operator (38).

(v) unitarity.

if r(u, v) is unitary (cf equation (85)), then rf

jk(u, v) is

unitary in the sense that

rf

jk(u, v)rf

kj(v, u) = id .

(107)

proof.

(i) the evenness of the fermionic r-operator is a direct consequence

of the compatibility condition (41).

(ii) using the commutation relations (29) and the projection property (31)

for the matrices ej
 as well as the compatibility condition (41) and the
yang-baxter equation (40), the matrix elements on both sides of (104)
can be reduced to

(1){p()p()+p()p()+p()p()+p()(p()+p())}

r

(1, 2)r

(u, 2)r

(u, 1)e1


 e2




.

(iii) the proof is similar to the proof of (ii). using (29), (31) and (41), (40)

both sides of equation (105) reduce to

(1){p()p()+p()p()+p()p()+p()(p()+p())+p()(p()+p())}

(1, 2)r
r

(u, 2)r

(u, 1)e1


 e2


 e3




.

(iv)

(1)p()+p()(p()+p())

 

 ej


ek



 = (1)p()ej


ek


 = pjk

.

(v) using (29), (31) and (41) we obtain

rf

jk(u, v)rf

kj(v, u) = (1)p()(p()+p())r

 (u, v)r

(v, u)ej


 ek




,

and the assertion follows from (85).

8 the shift operator

in this section we shall use the fermionic r-operator introduced above in
order to dene the shift operator for inhomogeneous graded models. we
shall explore the properties of the shift operator and shall eventually use
these properties to prove our main result (86).

let us start with a slightly more general concept. the inhomogeneous
monodromy matrix dened in (58) is an ordered product of l-matrices. in
the following we shall indicate the order of the factors by supplying subscripts
to the monodromy matrix

t1...l(u; 1, . . . , l) = t(u; 1, . . . , l) = ll(u, l) . . . l1(u, 1)

.

(108)

as can be seen from (103) and (104) the fermionic r-operator rf
jj+1(j, j+1)
interchanges the two neighbouring factors lj+1(u, j+1) and lj(u, j) in the
monodromy matrix. since the symmetric group sl is generated by the
transpositions of nearest neighbours, the l-matrices on the right hand side of
(108) can be arbitrarily reordered by application of an appropriate product
of fermionic r-operators. this means that for every   sl there exists
an operator r
1...l(1, . . . , l), which is a product of fermionic r-operators
and induces the action of the permutation   sl on the inhomogeneous
monodromy matrix,

r

1...l(1, . . . , l)t1...l(u; 1, . . . , l) =

t (1)... (l)(u;  (1), . . . ,  (l))r

1...l(1, . . . , l)

.

(109)

the non-graded analogue of this operator was introduced in [16].

let us construct r

1...l = r

1...l(1, . . . , l) explicitly. we shall use the shorthand
notation r
jk =
rf
jk(j, k) whenever the order of the inhomogeneities 1, . . . , l is the same
as the order of the corresponding lattice sites. for j = 1, . . . , l  1 dene
j  sl by

1...l(1, . . . , l), t1...l(u) = t1...l(u; 1, . . . , l) and rf

j + 1 if k = j,
j
k

if k = j + 1,
else.

j(k) =


(110)

the j  sl are transpositions of nearest neighbours. it follows from (103),
(104) that

rf

jj+1

t1...l(u) = tj (1)...j (l)(u) rf

jj+1

.

(111)

29

this means that rj

jj+1. choose   sl arbitrarily. then

1...l = rf
t (1) ...  (l)(u) = t j (1) ...  j (l)(u) rf

 (j), (j+1)

rf

 (j), (j+1)

.

(112)

since the transpositions of nearest neighbours j, j = 1, . . . , l  1, generate
the symmetric group sl, there is a nite sequence (jp)n
p=1, such that  =
j1 . . . jn. let p = j1 . . . jp, p = 1, . . . , n and 0 = id. then  = n, and,
using (112), we conclude that

rf

p1(jp),p1(jp+1)

tp1(1) ... p1(l)(u) = tp(1) ... p(l)(u) rf

p1(jp),p1(jp+1)

,

(113)

for p = 1, . . . , n. by iteration of the latter equation we obtain

rf
n1(jn),n1(jn+1) . . . rf

1(j2),1(j2+1)

rf

j1,j1+1

t1...l(u) =

t (1) ...  (l)(u) rf

n1(jn),n1(jn+1) . . . rf

1(j2),1(j2+1)

rf

j1,j1+1

.

(114)

thus we have constructed an explicit expression for the operator r

1...l,

r

1...l = rf

n1(jn),n1(jn+1) . . . rf

1(j2),1(j2+1)

rf

j1,j1+1

.

(115)

let us now specify to the case, when  is equal to the cyclic permutation
 = 1 . . . l1. then jp = p, p = 1, . . . , l1, in our above construction, and
p = 1 . . . p. thus p1(jp) = p1(p) = 1, and p1(jp + 1) = p1(p + 1) =
p + 1. using (115) we obtain

r

1...l = rf

1l

rf

1l1 . . . rf

12

.

(116)

the operator r
dromy matrix. now (112) implies that

1...l induces a shift by one site on the inhomogeneous mono-

r

(1)...(l)

t(1)...(l)(u) = t2(1)...2(l)(u)r

(1)...(l)

.

(117)

it follows by multiplication by r

1...l from the right, that

r2

1...l = r

(1)...(l)

r

1...l

.

(118)

iterating the above steps we arrive at the following lemma.

rn

1...l

t1...l(u) = tn+1...l1...n(u) rn

1...l

.

since l = id, we conclude from (121) that

rl

1...l

t1...l(u) = t1...l(u) rl

1...l

.

if rf

jk is unitary, we have the following stronger result.

lemma 3. let rf

jk be unitary (cf equation 107). then

rl

1...l = id .

(121)

(122)

(123)

proof. let us rst prove the case l = 2. then r

pothesis, rf

here we used the regularity in the rst equation. in the second equation we
reversed the order of factors and introduced a product of kronecker deltas.

equation (133) is the inhomogeneous analogue of equation (53).

lemma 5. we have the following expression for the shift operator in terms

str(t1...l(j))

if r(u, v) is unitary (cf equation (85)), then rn

summary

in this article we obtained an explicit solution of the quantum inverse problem
for fundamental graded models. our main result is the general formula (86).

this formula expresses the local projection operators en
, which represent
local spins and local elds, in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix.
the formula and its proof essentially simplify for translationally invariant
models (all inhomogeneities coincide, j = ). in the translationally invariant
case the proof is based on the representation of the shift operator as a product
of permutation matrices.

we presented explicit formulae for the solution of the quantum inverse
problem for the xyz quantum spin chain (17)-(19) and for the supersymmet-
ric t-j model of strongly correlated electrons (91)-(98). for the xyz chain
the local projection operators coincide with local pauli matrices (quantum
spin operators).

35

we are planing to use our results in forthcoming publications in order
to obtain multiple integral representations for correlation functions of funda-
mental graded models.
