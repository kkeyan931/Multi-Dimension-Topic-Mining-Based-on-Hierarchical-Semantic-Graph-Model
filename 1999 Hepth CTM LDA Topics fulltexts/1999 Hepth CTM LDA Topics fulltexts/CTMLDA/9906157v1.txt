abstract

the quantum 2-component ds1 system in two dimensions has been reduced to two 2-
component many-body problems both in one dimension by an analogue of the method of
separation of variables. the solutions to 2 dimensional problem under consideration can be
constructed from the resulting problem in one dimensions. for latters with the - function in-
teractions and being solved by the bethe ansatz, we introduce symmetrical and antisymmetrical
young operators of the permutation group and obtain the exact solutions for the quantum ds1
system.

1, introduction the davey-stewartson 1 (ds1) system is an integrable model in space of two

spatial and one temporal dimensions ((2+1)d). the quantized ds1 system with scalar elds (1

component or shortly 1c) can be formulated in terms of the hamiltonian of quantum many-body

problem in two dimensions, and some of them can be solved exactly[1][2]. particularly, it has been

shown in ref.[2] that these 2d1c quantum n -body problems (2d1cnbp) can be reduced to the

solvable one-dimensional quantum many-body problems (1d1cnbp) with two-body potentials[3].

thus through solving 1d1cnbp we can get the solutions to 2d1cnbp. here the key step is to

separate the spatial variables of 2d1cnbp by constructing an ansatz[1][2]

(1,    , n , 1,    , n ) = yi<j

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))x(1,    , n )y (1,    , n )

where ij = i  j and ij = i  j. this ansatz will be called the n-body variable-separation

ansatz (nbvsa). it is well known that the variable-separation methods are widely used in solving

high-dimensional one-particle problems. for instance, for geting the wave functions of electron in

hydrgen atom, the ansatz (r, , ) = r(r)p ()() is used to reduce the 3d problem to 1ds

(this ansatz is what we call the 1-body variable-separation ansatz or 1bvsa). the nbvsa can

be thought as the extension of 1bvsa. since the n-body problems are much more complicated

than the 1-body problems, it will be highlly nontrivial to construct a nbvsa. ref.[1] provided the

rst example for it and showed that the idea of variable- separating works indeed for the n-body

problems induced from the ds1 system .

in this paper, we intend to generalize the above idea to multicomponents ds1 system, namely

to construct a new nbvsa for the multicomponents case and to solve a specic model of 2d

quantum ds1 system with multicomponents.

2

1d n-body model with 2-components (1d2cnbp) has been investigated for long time[4][5].

the most famous one is the model with delta-function interaction between 2c-fermions[4]. it was

solved by the bethe ansatz [6] and leads to the yang-baxter equation and its thermodynamics studies

because of the completeness of the bethe ansatz solutions. in this paper, for deniteness, we shall

study specic 2d2cnbp associated with the dsi system. the 2d2cnbp under consideration can

be reduced to two 1d2cnbp of ref.[4] and then be exactly solved by using an appropriate nbvsa

and the bethe ansatz.

2, quantum ds1 system with two components in 2-dimension following usual ds1

equation[1][7], the equation for the ds1 system with two components reads

i q = 

1
2

(2

x + 2

y )q + ia1q + ia2q,

where q has two colour components,

q =   q1

q2 ! ,

and

(x  y)a1 = ic(x + y)(qq)

(x + y)a2 = ic(x  y)(qq)

(1)

(2)

where notation  means the hermitian transposition, and c is the coupling constant. introducing

the coordinates  = x + y,  = x  y, we have

a1 = ic1

 (qq)  iu1()

a2 = ic1

 (qq) + iu2()

(4)

where

 (qq) =

(z

d)q(, , t)q(, , t),

and u1 and u2 are constants of integration. according to ref.[2], we choose them as

u1() =

u2() =

1

2z ddu1(  )q(, , t)q(, , t)
2z ddu2(  )q(, , t)q(, , t).

thus eq.(1) can be written as

i q = (2

 + 2

 )q + c[1

 (qq) + 1

 (qq)]q
2 z dd[u1(  ) + +u2(  )](qq)q,

1

where q = q(, , t). we quantize the system with the canonical commutation relations

[qa(, , t), q

b (, , t)] = 2ab(  )(  ),

[qa(, , t), qb(, , t)] = 0.

(7)

(9)

(10)

where a, b = 1 or 2, [, ]+ and [, ] are anticommutator and commutator respectively. then eq.(8)

can be written in the form

q = i[h, q]

where h is the hamiltonian of the system

h =

the n -particle wave function a1...an is dened by eq.(14), which satises the n -body schrodinger

equation

[u1(ij) + u2(ij)]a1...an = ea1...an

+xi<j

where ij = i  j, (ij) = i(ij ), and (ij) = 1 for ij > 0, 0 for ij = 0, 1 for ij < 0. since

there are products of distributions in eq.(15), an appropriate regularezation for avoiding uncertainty

is necessary. this issue has been discussed in ref.[8].

3, variable separation of quantum ds1 with two components and bethe ansatz

our purpose is to solve the n -body schrodinger equation (15). the results in ref.[2] remind us

that we can make the following ansatz

where m and n are matrices being independent of  and , and both xa1...an (1 . . . n ) and

yb1...bn (1 . . . n ) are one-dimensional wave functions of n-bodies. substituting eq.(16) into eq.(15),

u1(ij)xa1...an = e1xa1...an

u2(ij)yb1...bn = e2yb1...bn

(17)

(18)

where u1(ij) and u2(ij) are two-body potentials, eqs.

(17) (18) are one-dimensional n -body

schrodinger equations and e1 + e2 = e. above derivation indicates that the two-dimensional

n -body schrodinger equation (15) has been reduced into two one-dimentional n -body schrodinger

equations. namely, the variables in the two-dimentional n -body wave function a1...an have been

separated.

at this stage m and n are unknown temporarily. it is expected that for any given pair

of exactly solvable 1d n-body problems and the correspondent solutions, we could construct the

solutions a1...an for 2d n-body problems eq.(15) through constructing an appropriate m  n -

matrix. it has been known that the 1d n-body problem in the form of (17) or (18) can be solved

exactly for a class of potentials[4][5][9]. to illustrate the construction of mn -matrix, we take both

potentials in (17) and (18) the delta functions u1(ij) = 2g(ij ) and u2(ij) = 2g(ij ) (g > 0, the

coupling constant). then eqs.(17) and (18) become

(19)

(20)

as x and y are wave functions of fermions with two components, denoted by x f and y f , the

problem has been solved by yang long ago[4] (more explicitly, see ref.[10] and ref.[11]). according to

the bethe ansatz, the continual solution of eq.(15) in the region of 0 < q1 < q2 < . . . < qn < l

the integers 1, 2, . . . , n , and

with  = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n. through exactly same procedures we can get the solution y f and

e2 to eq.(20).

as x and y are bosons wave-functions, denoted by x b and y b, it is easy to be shown that

x b = xp

y b is same as x b. it is well known that x f and y f (x b and y b) are antisymmetrical (symme-

trecal) as the coordinates and the colour-indeces of the particles interchanges each other simulta-

neously, instead of the coordinates interchanges each other merely.

(34)

(35)

lemma 1: (on xf )(1, 2,    , n ) is antisymmetrical with respect to the coordinates interchanges

of (i  j).

8

proof: from the denition of on (eq.(32)), we have

on p ab = p abon = on .

(36)

to n = 3 case, for example, the direct calculations show o3p 12 = p 12o = o3, o3p 23 = p 23o =

o3 and so on. using eqs.(36) and (23), we have

on y lm

ij = (1)on .

from eqs.(21) and (23), x f can be written as

x f = {ei(k1q1 +k2q2 +...+kn qn ) + y 12

12 ei(k2q1 +k1q2 +...+kn qn )

(37)

(38)

using eqs.(37) and (38), we obtain

(on x f )(1,    , n ) = {ei(k1q1 +k2q2 +...+kn qn )  ei(k2q1 +k1q2 +...+kn qn )

+ei(k2q1 +k3q2 +k1q3 +...+kn qn ) + (n !  3) other terms }on (q)

12...n

(1)p exp{i[kp1 q1 + . . . + kpn qn ]}(on (q)

12...n ).

(39)

= xp

therefore we conclude that (on x f )(1,    , n ) is antisymmetrical with respect to (i  j).

lemma 2: (an x b)(1, 2,    , n ) is antisymmetrical with respect to the coordinates interchanges

of (i  j).

proof: noting (see eqs.(33) (29) (27))

an p ab = p aba = an ,

an z lm

ij = (1)an ,

9

(40)

(41)

we then have

(an x b)(1,    , n ) = xp

then the lemma is proved.

(1)p exp{i[kp1q1 + . . . + kpn qn ]}(an (q)

12...n ).

(42)

5, the solutions of the problem the ansatz of eq.(16) can be compactly written as

(1 

 = yi<j

c
4

(ij)(ij ))(mx)(n y )

(43)

where (mx) and (n y ) are required to be antisymmetrical under the interchanges of the coodinate

vairables. according to lemmas 1 and 2, we see that

m, n = ( on

an

for 1d formion
for 1d boson.

(44)

as the ds1 elds qa() in eq.(1) are (2+1)d bose elds, the commutators ([, ], see (9) and

(10)) are used to quantized the system and the 2d n-body wave functions denoted in b must be

symmetrical under the colour-interchang (ai  aj) and the coordinate-interchange ((ii) 

(ji)). namly, the 2d bose wave functions b must satisfy that

p aiaj b |iij j = b.

(45)

as qa are (2+1)d fermi elds, the anticommutators should be used, and f must be antisymmet-

rical under (ai  aj) and ((ii)  (ji)). namly,

p aiaj f |iij j = f .

thus for the 2d boson case, two solutions of b can be constructed as following

b

1 = yi<j
2 = yi<j

b

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[on x f (1    n )][on y f (1    n )],

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[an x b(1    n )][an y b(1    n )].

10

(46)

(47)

(48)

using eqs.(36),(39),(40) and (42), we can check eq.(45) diractly. in addition, from the bethe ansatz

equations (25) (26) (30) (31) and e = e1 + e2, we can see that the eigenvalues of b

1 and b

2 are

dierent each other generally, i.e., the states corrosponding to b

1 and b

2 are non-degenerate.

for the 2d fermion case, the desired results are

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[on x f (1    n )][an y b(1    n )],

(1 

c
4

(ij)(ij))[an x b(1    n )][on y f (1    n )].

f

1 = yi<j
2 = yi<j

f

(49)

(50)

eq.(46) can also be checked diractly. the eigenvalues corresponding to f are also determined by

the bethe equations and e = e1 + e2.

it is similar to ref.[2] that we can prove b

1,2 and f

1,2 shown in above are of the exact

solutions of the eq.(15). thus we conclude that the 2d quantum many-body problem induced from

the quantum ds1 system with 2-component has been solved exactly.

6, summary to summarize. we formulated the quantum multicomponent ds1 system in terms

of the quantum multicomponent many-body hamiltonain in 2d space. then we reduced this

2d hamiltonain to two 1d multicomponent many-body problems. as the potential between two

particles with two components in one dimension is function, the bethe ansatz was used to solve

these 1d problems. by using the ansatz of ref.[1] and introducing some useful young operators,

we presented a new nbvsa for fusing two 1d-solutions to construct 2d wave functions of the

quantum many-body problem which is induced from the quantum 2-component ds1 system. there

are two types of wave functions: bosons and fermions. both of them satisfy the 2d many-body

schrodinger equation of the ds1 system exactly.
