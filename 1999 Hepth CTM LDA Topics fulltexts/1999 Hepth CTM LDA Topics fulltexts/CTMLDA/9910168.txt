(3) here, , 1 non-minimal parameters. notice interactions axial vector, , important cases (2) (3). interaction scalars q spinors scalars may introduced, purely non-minimal. sequel, consider axial part, s, torsion tensor. also, since metric torsion independent elds, especially interested torsion eects, follows consider metric only. problem action dynamical torsion eld crucially important investigations gravity torsion. literature, one meet several dierent approaches construction torsion action . particular,  started gauge principle gravity (similar ideas popular; see  com- prehensive review). , family high-derivative metric-torsion actions, leading theories without unphysical massive spin-2 ghosts constructed. therefore, works, guiding principle unitarity theory. analysis physical signicance torsion, important part axial component, , component couples fermions. , readily noticed study possible torsion eects low energies, second-derivative terms indeed relevant. furthermore, , established that, usual vector eld, propagation transverse longitudinal parts axial vector un- avoidably breaks unitarity (see, example, ). that, , longitudinal part considered, torsion thereby reduced pseudoscalar piece. , problem consistency formulated closed form, taking aspects eective eld theory account. choice action dynamical torsion eld made way leads unitary renormalizable eective quantum eld theory. let us see principle applied fermion-torsion interaction. starting (2), may notice action possesses two symmetries: usual gauge one, = ei(x), = ei(x), v = v + q1 (x), additional symmetry softly broken spinor mass : = ei5(x) , = ei5(x), = 1 (x) . (4) (5) fact, last symmetry key point allowing set unique form torsion action. even softly broken, symmetry yields appearance transverse second- derivative counterterm s2 (exactly softly broken) massive counterterm, coming, instance, single fermion loop (see, example, calculations next section). thus, wish renormalizable eective eld theory torsion, two terms must included action dynamical torsion. hand, condition unitarity forbids third possible structure 4, (s)2 . 4all possible terms exhibit higher derivatives non-local. 4 therefore, chance meet conditions low-energy renormalizability unitarity choose expression storf er = z d4x (cid:26) 1 4 ss + 1 2 2 ss +  (cid:27) (6) torsion-fermion action. expression (6) shall main object study present paper. however, instructive us see, introduction scalar elds explicitly breaks scheme. one consult second work ref.  complete consideration. one implements scalars, yukawa interaction produces rigid breaking symmetry (5). happens yukawa coupling massless. result breaking, restrictions divergences coming diagrams including yukawa vertex. proved , diagrams really require longitudinal counterterm (s)2 two-loop level. course, order renormalizable theory, term (s)2 might introduced torsion action but, already mentioned, immediately breaks unitarity. therefore, torsion-fermion-scalar theory, manifest conict renormalizability unitarity. conict resembles similar one takes place high-derivative gravity . dierence that, gravity, massless mode provides classical eects propagation graviton, torsion massless modes, lightest torsion mode mass planck order, independent torsion eld simply exist. one imagine several possibilities overcome crisis renormalizability unitarity, described above. instance, possible search extra symmetry providing cancellation longitudinal divergences. another option restrict considerations theories without fundamental scalars, technicolour nambu- jona-lasinho models. view this, becomes especially important investigate whether fermion-torsion system satises consistency conditions. present paper, going make complete study conditions renormalizability unitarity fermion-torsion system without scalar elds. next sections, shall show that, unfortunately, despite breaking symmetry (5) soft, nal situation similar one scalar elds. one may maintain unitarity renormalized theory, expenses rigid limit torsion mass, must much larger one fermions much lighter fundamental scale. 3. boulwares parametrization ward identities need perform analogue boulware transformation  fermion - axial vector system. pedagogical reasons, rst consider usual vector case, is, repeat transformation . action, original variables, form: smvec = z d4x (cid:26) 1 4 vv + 1 2 2 vv +  (cid:27) , (7) and, change eld variables : = exp(cid:26) ig (cid:27) , = exp(cid:26) ig (cid:27) , v = v 1 , (8) 5 new scalar, , completely factored out: smvec = z d4x (cid:26) 1 (cid:17)2 4 (cid:16)v + 1 2 2 v v + 1 2 +  (cid:27) . (9) let us consider fermion-torsion system given action (6). change variables, similar one (8), form: = exp(cid:26) 5 (cid:27) , = exp(cid:26) 5 (cid:27) , = 1 , (10) sk = transverse longitudinal parts axial vector respectively, latter equivalent pseudoscalar . one notice that, contrary (8), full accordance (5), signs exponents (10) same. terms new variables, action becomes storf er = z d4x (cid:26) 1 4 + 1 2 2 s+ +i  + 1 2 (cid:27) , (11) = = . last expression easily analyzed comparison similar parametrization massive abelian eld (8). contrary last, torsion axial vector (11) scalar mode decouple, rather couple interactions follows: i) yukawa-type, resembling problems ordinary scalar. ii) exponential, prevents model power-counting renormalizable. however, rst sight, hope features would fatal theory. respect point (i), one guess result non- factorization, could dangerous consistency eective quantum theory, would propagation longitudinal mode torsion, directly follow non-factorization scalar degree freedom classical action. hand, (ii) indicates non-renormalizability, might mean appearance higher-derivative divergences, matter within eective approach. thus, detailed analysis necessary. particular, one-loop calculation theory (6) may helpful, done next section. let us consider, moment, ward-takahashi identities two theories (7) (6.) case massive vector (7), identity eective action,  , (here v, , mean, background elds) form v + ie ! im 2v = 0 . (12) applying /v operator, setting v, , = 0, get identities inverse propagator 2 v(x)v(y) = 2(x y) . (13) 6 now, applying 2/(y) (z), one obtains 3 (y) (z)v(x) = ie 2 (y) (z) (x y) 2 (y) (z) (x z)! . (14) similar relations take place vertices. vector mass completely decouples shows exclusively propagator. indeed, circumstances, cannot aect divergences, except trivial way. result nothing direct conrmation decoupling observed boulware-like parametrization (9). case massive axial vector eld (6), have, means analogous proce- dures, 5 5! + 2im 5 + 2s = 0 . (15) applying functional derivatives, ward-takahashi identities inverse propagator vertices take form: 2 s(x)s(y) = 2(x y) 3 (z)s(x)(y) = 2im5(x y)(x z) + + 2 (z)(y) 5(x y) + (x z)5 2 (y) (z)! , (16) (17) on. last expressions manifest clear dierence respect previous ones, (12) (14). axial vector case, massive term aects interaction vertices, one expect non-invariant divergences may show up. 4. one-loop calculation fermion-torsion case. purpose section derive full set 1-loop counterterms massive axial vector coupled dirac spinor. get them, going apply background eld method together schwinger-dewitt expansion. however, since use methods system interest quite non-trivial, also pedagogical reasons, perform also three auxiliary calculations: massless vector coupled massive spinor (qed), massless axial vector (this one coupled massless spinors) massive vector, using calculational scheme case massive axial vector. additional calculations collected appendix a. here, present details calculation massive axial vector. let us start fermionic determinant, already considered many au- thors . contribution single fermion loop given expression (1) f ermion = r ln h , h = {id + m} . (18) here, = +i5s covariant derivative. proves useful introduce conjugate derivative, = i5s. then, one write f ermion = 2 r ln h h = 2 r ln {dd m2} = 7 = 2 r ln { (d + m2) } . (19) simple algebra, one cast two useful forms operator parenthesis: non-covariant: h h = 2 + r + , r = 25s , = i5(s) + 2 5s + 2ss + m2 ; (20) covariant h h = d2 + ed + f, e = 25s 2i5s , f = m2 + 2 5s . (21) (22) expressions compatible use standard schwinger-dewitt technique (covariant calculation much shorter), yields well-known result (1) f ermion,div = n4 z dnx ( 22 3 ss 8m22ss + 2m4) . (23) here, = (4)2 (n 4) parameter dimensional regularization. now, position start complete calculation divergences. use background eld method supposes split (shift) eld variables background quantum part. however, case (axial)vector-fermion system, simple shift elds leads enormous volume calculations, even massive vector. calculation becomes extremely dicult axial massive vector (6). invented simple trick combining background eld method boulware transformation (10) quantum elds. shall see moment, method makes calculations reasonably simpler. let us divide elds background (s, , ) quantum (t , , , ) parts, ac- cording follows: 5 ( + ) , = ei = ( + ) ei 5 , 1 = + . one-loop eective action depends quadratic (in quantum elds) part total action: s(2) = 1 2 z d4x (t ( + 2 )t + () + ( 2 5 ) + ( 4m2 2 ) + + ( 25 ) + ( 4im 5) + ( 4im 5) + (2id + 2m )(cid:27) . (24) 8 making usual change fermionic variables 5, = i, arrive following expression: 2 (d+im) , substituting s(2) = 1 2 z d4x ( ) h , hermitian bilinear form h form ( + 2) 0 (l + ) h = 0 p + n q + b 1 + r + , (25) 1 = projector transverse vector states. elements matrix operator (25) dened according (24). include expressions (20) also l = 5 , = 2i 5 , = 2 + 5 , b = 22 2 m2 5 , n = 42 2 , p = 25 , q = 4 5 . (26) operator h given might look like minimal second order operator ( + 2h + ); but, fact, minimal projectors axial vector- axial vector sector. one cannot directly apply standard schwinger- dewitt expansion derive divergent contributions one-loop eective action, sophisticated technique needed. let us perform expansion transverse axial vector space, apply generalized schwinger-dewitt technique developed barvinsky vilkovisky . extent, transformations going similar ones used calculations high-derivative gravity coupled matter  (see also ). notice that, present case, transformations enable one perform calculations abelian vector theory. massless case, results indeed ones derived use faddeev-popov method. since dealing mixed operator including boson fermion sectors, trace products understood supertrace (str), implies positive sign bosonic sector negative sign fermionic sector. one perform following expansion: (1) = 2 str lnh = 2 str ln 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 str ( xn=1 (1)n n ( 1 )n) , (27) operator corresponds (25): 2 1 0 n 1 1 q 1 0 p (l + ) 1 1 + b 1 (r + ) 1 1 = . (28) 5one remember jacobian change variables already taken account before, divergences counted (23). 9 going use universal traces , since working space-time, non-zero traces, given n, tr ( 1 ... 2n4 1 n )|div = 2i z d4x g(n2) 1 ... 2n4 2n2(n 1)! . (29) here, standard notational conventions  used: g(0) = 1 , g(2) = g , g(4) = gg + gg + gg , e.t.c. . easy see, counting number derivative terms series (27), divergences appear n = 2, 3, 4 ones coming n = 4 completely dened fermionic operator (18), already taken account. therefore, need work terms n = 2, 3. consider n = 2 term.

(45) (46) summing contributions one-loop divergences (27), coming (43) (46) (23), obtain complete expression one-loop divergences: (1) div = n4 z dnx ( 22 3 ss + 8m22 ss 2m4 + 3 2 4+ + 82 m3 2 62m! + 84 m2 4 ( )2 + 4i2 m2 2 ) . (47) interesting notice expression (47) gauge invariant. dicult see non-invariant terms come contribution scalar . indicates that, unlike massive (abelian) vector eld (see appendix a), massive axial vector violation symmetry (5) soft. therefore, conrmed previous analysis based ward-takahashi identities. detailed consideration renormalization presented next section. 5. renormalization renormalization group expression (47) 1-loop divergences theory (6) two non-invariant pieces. rst one comes term, invariant respect (5). fact, divergence produces slight change renormalization coupling constant , softly broken symmetry (5) maintained quantum level. second term essentially non-invariant ( )2-structure. renormalizability theory requires ( )2 term introduced classical action, corresponding counterterm removed means renormalization corresponding parameter. indeed, one calculate 1-loop divergences taking term account. hand, necessary, one-loop diagram containing ( )2-vertex could contribute dangerous longitudinal divergence. 6 unfortunately, diagram exists two-loop level. postpone analysis two-loop diagrams next section, consider now, details, one-loop renormalization. appearance new ( )2-vertex shows fermion-torsion theory cannot consistent even eective quantum eld theory, least without additional restrictions imposed. let us try introduce additional restrictions value 6 let us remind danger (s )2-type counterterm, spoils renormalizability unitarity theory. 12 torsion mass, m. suppose m. means torsion mass much (let us say, orders) larger mass fermion interacting torsion. alternatively, one suppose torsion interacts massless spinors (this case free problem quantum level, existence massless spinors sm nowadays problematic) light fermions decouples, denition, heavy fermions. since simplied consideration distinguish heavy light quarks, leptons etc, accept moment. then, types non-invariant counterterms carry small coecients, proportional (m/m)2. suppose include dangerous interaction ( )2 action, small coupling order m2/m 4. relation violated renormalization group running coupling , hence renormalizability achieved weak coupling ( )2. shall see next section, two-loop contribution dangerous longitudinal counterterm (s)2 contains ( )2-vertex. therefore, one nds possible preserve renormalizability (s)2-term included action (6) coecient b (m/m)4. formally, (s)2-structure present, unitarity broken, since corresponding degree freedom ghost. term, along canonical kinetic term ss, un- avoidably plague spectrum unphysical modes: either tachyonic negative-norm state (ghost) excitation show spin-1 scalar excitation. however, unitarity still ensured spinor sector theory; may break torsion torsion sector. let us consider low-energy amplitude involving in-states propagating transverse torsion. order generate out-states longitudinal torsion, one consider diagrams corresponding vertices. vertices absent tree-level, ones, involve non-invariant ( )2-interaction show up, shall see next section, second loop only. then, longitudinal out-state suppressed coecient (m/m)4. therefore, low-energy amplitudes torsion (axial vector s) scattering, unitarity maintained precision (m/m)4. consider one-loop renormalization corresponding renormalization group details. relations bare renormalized elds coupling follow (47): s(0) = n4 2 1 + 1 42 3 ! , (0) = n4 2 1 + 1 22m2 2 ! , 2 similar relations parameter = 4 (0) = 1 4n 43 3 "1 + 6 m2 2#! .
