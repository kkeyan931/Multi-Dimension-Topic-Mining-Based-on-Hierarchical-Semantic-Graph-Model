abstract

we consider 10-dimensional super yang-mills theory with topological
terms compactied on a noncommutative torus. we calculate supersym-
metry algebra and derive bps energy spectra from it. the cases of d-
dimensional tori with d = 2, 3, 4 are considered in full detail. so(d, d, z)-
invariance of the bps spectrum and relation of new results to the previous
work in this direction are discussed.

introduction

in this paper we consider supersymmetric gauge theories on non-
commutative tori. it was shown in [3] that such gauge theories can
be obtained as compactications of m(atrix) theory . more precisely
we can consider compactications of bfss matrix model ([1]) on a
noncommutative d-dimensional torus t. another way to look at
this model is by considering rst a compactication of ikkt model
[2] (as it was suggested in [3]) on a (1 + d)-dimensional torus of
the form t = s1  t and then performing a wick rotation of that
theory with the s1 factor corresponding to the time direction.

for the case of commutative torus our calculations agree with
well known results (see for example [11]). they agree also with
calculations performed in [10] in the context of born-infeld theory.

1

partial answer to the problem we consider is contained also in [7],
[8]. the terms that were taken into account in these papers agree
with our results.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we calculate super-
symmetry algebra of the model and derive the expression for bps
energy spectrum out of it. in section 3 we calculate bps spectra for
d = 2, 3, 4 explicitly in terms of topological numbers and eigenvalues
of the total momentum and the zero mode of electric eld. in sec-
tion 4 we discuss the invariance of the bps spectra with respect to
so(d, d|z) transformations. finally, we discuss the case of modules
admitting a constant curvature connection. we show that for this
case our new results can be reproduced by the method used in our
previous paper [9] for the analysis of modules admitting constant
curvature connection over two-dimensional tori.

2 supersymmetry algebra and bps spectrum

let t be a d-dimensional noncommutative torus specied by an
antisymmetric d d matrix . such a torus can be dened by means
of generators u1, . . . , ud satisfying

ukuj = e2ikj

ujuk .

let us consider derivations i of t determined by the following
relations

kuj = 2ikjuj

(1)

where kj
abelian lie algebra denoted by l.

is the kronecker symbol. these derivations span an

consider an abelian 10-dimensional lie algebra l that acts on t
by means of derivations belonging to l. this means that for every
x  l we have an operator x  l obeying x(ab) = x(a)b +
ax(b) for any a, b  t . then a connection x on e can be dened
as a set of linear operators x : e  e, x  l satisfying the
leibnitz rule:

x(ae) = axe + (xa)e

(2)

for any a  t , e  e. (we assume that x and x depend linearly
on x.) we also suppose that l is equipped with a minkowski signa-

2

ture metric. these data are sucient to dene an action functional
of the m(atrix) theory (bfss model) compactied on t.

let us adopt the following conventions about indices. the capital
latin indices i, j, . . . run from 0 to 9, greek indices , , . . . run from
0 to d, the small latin indices i, j, . . . take values from 1 to d, and
the tilted small latin indices , , . . . take values from d + 1 to 9. we
assume that one can x a basis xi of the lie algebra l such that
xi = i,  = 0, and the metric tensor gij in this basis satises
g00 = r2
0, gi0 = 0 if i 6= 0, gi = 0, g, = ,. the conditions on
gij mean that it can be written as the following block matrix

where i is a connection on a t-module e,  is a ten-dimensional
majorana-weyl spinor taking values in the algebra endte of en-
domorphisms of e, ij is an antisymmetric tensor with the only
non-vanishing components ij, and i are gamma-matrices satisfy-
ing {i, j } = 2gij. it follows from our conventions on xi that
 = x where x are endomorphisms of e (scalar elds).

in [9] we discussed the quantization of yang-mills theory on a
noncommutative torus in the 0 = 0 gauge. those considerations
can be easily generalized to the supersymmetric case at hand. let
us briey describe the quantization procedure. the minkowski ac-
tion functional (4) is dened on the conguration space conne 
(endte)16 where conne denotes the space of connections on e,

3

 denotes the parity reversion operator. to describe the hamil-
tonian formulation we rst restrict ourselves to the space m =
conne  (endte)9  (endt e)16 where conne stands for the
space of connections satisfying 0 = 0, the second factor corre-
sponds to a cotangent space to conne. we denote coordinates on
that cotangent space by p i. let n  m be a subspace where the
gaussian constraint [i, p i] = 0 is satised. then the phase space
of the theory is the quotient p = n /g where g is the group of
spatial gauge transformations.

the presymplectic form (i.e. a degenerate closed 2-form)  on

m is dened as

 = trp i  i  i

v

tr 0   .

(5)

it descends to a symplectic form on the phase space p which deter-
mines poisson brackets {., .}p b.

( supersymmetry transformations are odd vector elds preserving

as one can readily calculate using (7) and (9), (10) the super-

symmetry algebra has the form

tr(ijij1 + 2fijij),
4g2
pi = trp i, pi = trfijp j + fermionic term, cij = trfij, cijkl =
trfijfkl.
in (11) we use the euclidean nine-dimensional gamma-
matrices i = r00i satisfying {i, j } = 2gij. note that in (11)
we assume that the index i does not take the zero value. when
calculating poisson brackets (11) it is convenient to use the identity
{a, b}p b = 1
2 (a(b)  b(a)) where a, b denote the hamiltonian
vector elds corresponding to functions a and b respectively.

after quantization the supersymmetry algebra (11) preserves its
form (one only needs to drop factors of i on the lhss), provided
q, q, h, pi, and pi are considered as self-adjoint operators in
a hilbert space. the quantities cij, cijkl, , dime are central
charges. as usual we dene bps states as states annihilated by a
part of supersymmetry operators. the energy h eigenvalues of bps
states can be expressed via values of central charges and eigenvalues
of operators pi, pi (the operators h, pi, and pi all commute with
each other). the energy of a 1/4-bps state on a d-dimensional torus
for d  4 is given by the formula

where kvk2 = vigijvj stands for the norm squared of a d-dimensional
vector v = (pi  (dime)1cijpj), and

c2 =

1
82 ijkl(cijkl  (dime)1cijckl) .

in formula (12) we use the same notations pi , pi for the eigenvalues
of the corresponding operators. note that when the term with the
square root vanishes we get a 1/2-bps state. here we would like to
make few remarks on how to obtain formula (12). first one notices
that commutators of supercharges (11) form a block matrix m.
the bps condition means that this matrix has a zero eigenvector.
as the block { q, q} is non-degenerate one can reformulate the
bps condition as the degeneracy condition on some square matrix
of dimension twice smaller than that of m. at that point one
can apply the standard technique of nding zero eigenvalues of ma-
trices expressed in terms of gamma matrices (for example see [11]
appendix b).

note that operators p, p have a continuum spectrum. every-
where below we restrict ourselves to the zero eigenvalue subspace for
these operators. moreover, we will not consider any eects of scalar
elds on the spectrum. below pi denotes the operator trfijp j.

the phase space p of the theory at hand is not simply connected.
it is well known that in such a case there is some freedom in quan-
tization. namely, in the framework of geometric quantization (see
[12] or appendix a of paper [9] for details) we can assign to every
function f on a phase space an operator f dened by the formula

f  = f  + ij f

xj i

(13)

where i = hi + i is a covariant derivative with respect to u(1)-
gauge eld having the curvature ij. here ij is a matrix of sym-
plectic form  and ij is the inverse matrix. the operator f acts
on the space of sections of a line bundle over the phase space. the
transition from f to f is called prequantization. it satises

[ f , g] = ih({f, g})

where {f, g} = f

xi ij g
xj

is the poisson bracket. notice that re-

6

placing  with  +  we change f in the following way

f = fold + (f ) = fold + ii
f

(14)

where f stands for the hamiltonian vector eld corresponding to
the function f . to dene a quantization we should introduce the so
called polarization, i.e. exclude half of the variables. then for every
function f on the phase space we obtain a quantum operator f .

if the gauge eld in (13) is replaced by a gauge equivalent eld
we obtain an equivalent quantization procedure. however, in the
case when the phase space is not simply connected the gauge class
of i in (13) is not specied uniquely. the simplest choice of the
1-form  in the system we consider is

 = trp ii  i

v
2g2

y m

tr 0 .

(15)

but we can also add to this  any closed 1-form , for example

 = itri + ijktri  fjk

(16)

where ijk is an antisymmetric 3-tensor and i is a 1-tensor. one
can check that for d  4 we obtain all gauge classes by adding (16)
to (15) (for d > 4 one should include additional terms labeled by
antisymmetric tensors of odd rank  5).
in the lagrangian for-
malism one can include topological terms into the action functional.
the addition of all topological terms to the lagrangian corresponds
to the consideration of all possible ways of (pre)quantization in the
hamiltonian formalism. the topological terms can be interpreted as
ramond-ramond backgrounds from the string theory point of view
(see [10], [8] for more details). the additional terms in the action
can be expressed in terms of the chern character. in particular, the
consideration of the form  +  given by (15), (16) corresponds to
adding the following terms to the action

stop = itrf0i + ijktrf0ifjk .

(17)

let us make one general remark here. assume that a rst order
linear dierential operator la dened by laf = {a, g}p b obeys
e2la = 1 (in other words the hamiltonian vector eld correspond-
ing to a generates the group u(1) = r/z). then it is easy to check

7

that

e2 a f e2 a = f
for any function f on the phase space.
after quantization we should expect

(18)

it follows from (18) that

e2i a = const.

we see that the eigenvalues of a are quantized; they have the form
m +  where m  z and  is a xed constant.

now let us discuss the spectrum of the operators pi, pi. our
considerations will be along the line proposed in [10]. consider a
hamiltonian vector eld pi corresponding to the gauge invariant
momentum functional pi = trfijp j. the variation of j under
the action of pi is equal to fij. let us x a connection 0
i on the
module e. then an arbitrary connection has the form i = 0
i +xi
where xi  endte. hence, we have

pi(j) = fij = [j, xi] + [0

i , j] .

(19)

here the rst term corresponds to innitesimal gauge transforma-
tion. therefore, up to a gauge transformation, pi generates a vector
eld acting as j = [0
i , j]. now one can check using (1), (2) and
the identity ej = 1 that the operator exp(0
j ) is an endomorphism,
i.e.

exp(0

j )uiexp(0

j ) = ui

and since it is unitary it represents a global gauge transformation.
this means that on the phase space of our theory (after taking a
quotient with respect to the gauge group) the identity exp(lpj ) = 1
is satised. here lpj stands for the dierential operator correspond-
ing to pj. as we already mentioned this identity leads to a quan-
tization of pj eigenvalues. namely, for some xed constant j the
eigenvalues of pj have the form

pj = 2(j + mj)

(20)

where mj is an integer. the quantization condition (20) is valid for
every choice of quantization procedure (for every  + ). however,
the constants j depend on this choice. using the freedom that we

8

have in the quantization we can take j = 0 when  = 0. in the
case of non-vanishing  we obtain using (14) and (19)

pj = 2mj + cjkk + cijkljkl .

(21)

quantization of the electric eld zero mode trp i comes from pe-
riodicity conditions on the space conne/g. it was rst noted in
[10] one can consider the operator ujexp(jkk) that commutes
with all ui and thus is an endomorphism. being unitary this op-
erator determines a gauge transformation. as one can easily check
this gauge transformation can be equivalently written as an action
of the operator

exp((2jk  jlflk)

)

(22)



k

on the space conne. therefore, on the space conne/g this oper-
ator descends to the identity. the hamiltonian vector eld dened
by the exponential of (22) corresponds to the functional 2pkkipi.
hence, as we explained above the quantum operator pk (2)1ki pi
has eigenvalues of the form ni + i where ni  z and i is a xed
number. proceeding as above we obtain the following quantization
law for eigenvalues of t r p i

pi = ni + ijmj + idime + ijkcjk

(23)

where ni is an integer and mj is the integer specifying the eigenvalue
of total momentum operator (21).

3 energies of bps states for d = 2, 3, 4

now we are ready to write explicit answers for d = 2, 3, 4. for d = 2
the chern character can be written as

ch(e) = (p  q) + q12

where p and q are integers such that p  q > 0. hence dime =
p  q, cij = ijq, c2 = 0 and we get the following answer for the
energies of bps states

e =

where p is an integer and q is an antisymmetric matrix with integral

4 morita equivalence

as it was rst shown in [4] yang-mills theories on noncommutative
tori t and t that are related by (complete) morita equivalence
are physically equivalent. we refer the reader to papers [4], [5], [6]
for a rigorous denition and discussion of morita equivalence and
its relation to physical duality. here we will only state the basic
results. compactications of m(atrix) theory on two d-dimensional
noncommutative tori t and t are physically equivalent i

 = (m + n)(r + s)1

where m, n, r, s are d  d blocks of the 2d  2d matrix

  m n
r s !

(27)

(28)

belonging to the group so(d, d|z). correspondence between dier-
ent quantities dened on a module e over t and on a module e over
t specied by morita equivalence, can be explicitly described by
means of the matrix (28). the metric gij transforms in the following
way

where a = s + r. for the curvatures one has the relation

g = agat

af at  rat = f  .

11

(29)

(30)

the antisymmetric tensor ij transformation reads

 = aat + rat .

the dimensions of e and e are connected by the relation

dim e = dime|deta|1/2 .

(31)

(32)

using (15) or (17) and (30) one can easily nd transformation laws
for the tensors i, ijk under morita equivalence (27):

ijk = |deta|1/2bi

i = |deta|1/2bi

mbk

l bj
nlmn
jj + ijkjk

where  = rat, b = (at)1.

the eigenvalues pi and pi transform as follows

pi = (at)1i
pi = aj

jpj ,

i pj  rijpj

(33)

(34)

(35)

using the above formulas it is easy to check the invariance of
spectrum (12) provided the yang-mills coupling constant g2
y m trans-
forms according to the formula g2
y m . one can also
check the invariance of expressions (24), (25), (26) written in terms
of topological numbers under so(d, d|z) transformations. one just
needs to note that, as it is shown in [4], the element (e) of a grass-
mann algebra containing topological numbers transforms according
to a spinor representation of so(d, d|z) under morita equivalence
transformation (27).

y m = |deta|1/2g2

5 modules with constant curvature connections

in the previous sections we calculated the energies of bps states in
the assumption that these states do exist.
in the present section
we will conrm our calculations by means of explicit semiclassical
construction. we will consider 1/2 bps elds (constant curvature
connections). one can calculate the energies of corresponding bps-
states restricting ourselves to a neighborhood of the set of constant

12

curvature connections. for d = 2 the calculations of this kind were
performed in [9]. the answer agrees with the calculations made
above. we will show that this result can be extended to the case of
d > 2. it is proved in [9] that under certain conditions on  every
module admitting a constant curvature connection can be trans-
formed into a free module by means of so(d, d|z) duality transfor-
mation. this means that it is sucient to consider free modules
when calculating bps energies.

let t be a noncommutative d-dimensional torus and e a module
over it admitting a constant curvature connection. we assume that
endte is a noncommutative torus t. then  and  are related by
means of an element of so(d, d|z) specied by a matrix

g =   m n

r s ! .

(36)

this element of so(d, d|z) transforms our module into a free module
of rank 1 (i.e.
the module we consider is a basic module in the
terminology of [9]). the torus t has generators zi satisfying

zjzk = e2ijk

zkzj .

1 z k2

2  . . .  z kd

let us consider the set c of all constant curvature connections. the
group of all gauge transformations acts on this set. this group is
disconnected. the group of its connected components is denoted by
glarge. one can check that the components of the set c are labeled
by elements of glarge/gmon where gmon corresponds to gauge trans-
formations dened by monomials z k1
d . more precisely,
it is easy to check that the gauge transformation corresponding to
such a monomial transforms a constant curvature connection 0
i
into a connection of the form 0
i + ci  1 that obviously belongs to
the same component of c. one can prove that a gauge transforma-
tion belonging to glarge/gmon transforms 0
i into a connection from
another component of c. the proof is based on the reduction to the
case of a free module by means of so(d, d|z)-transformation. now
we can describe the part of the phase space corresponding to a small
neighborhood of the space c. we should x a constant curvature
connection 0 and consider small uctuations of connections of the
form 0
i + ci  1 satisfying the gaussian constraint [i, p i] = 0 or

13

more precisely obeying the linearization of this identity. (in other
words we consider a small neighborhood of the set {0
i + ci  1} in
the space n dened above.) we should impose also the gauge con-
dition restricting ourselves to uctuations that are orthogonal to the
gauge group orbits (see [9] for details). then the phase space can
be obtained from this neighborhood by means of factorization with
respect to gmon. (again the easiest way to verify this statement is
to use a so(d, d|z) transformation to a free module.)

factorization with respect to the group gmon leads to the de-
scribed above quantization conditions on the eigenvalues of the op-
erators tr p i and pj. namely, one rst introduces a basis in the lie
algebra l in which the condition [j, zk] = 2ijkzk is satised.
this basis is related to the standard basis dened by the relations
[j, uk] = 2ijkuk by means of the matrix a = r + s. in this
new basis factorization over the action of the group gmon gives the
following eigenvalues of the zero mode of electric eld

pi = ei + ij xk

d1

xm=1

nm(k)kj .

(37)

here nm(k) stands for the energy level of the m-th transverse oscil-
lator with momentum k, ei are integers, pi denotes the components
calculated with respect to the new basis. going to the standard
basis, i.e. acting by the matrix a on (37), one obtains

pi = ni + ijmj

ni = (st)i

where matrices m, n, r, s are the corresponding blocks of the ma-
trix (36) introduced above. as one can check directly the numbers
mi given by formula (39) are eigenvalues of the operator (2)1pi
as it is expected from considerations above. furthermore, we obtain

where a = r + s, dime = |deta|1/2. one can minimize the

where vi = a1
j mk  rjknk), a = r + s and r and s are
blocks of the matrix (36). this formula agrees with formula (12)
if one takes into account the identity trfij = (a1r)ijdime and
the fact that the constant c2 vanishes for a module admitting a
constant curvature connection. we skipped all technical details here
as the calculation essentially parallels the one made in [9] for the case
d = 2. we also omitted the possible topological terms in formulas
(40), (41). one can easily restore them.
