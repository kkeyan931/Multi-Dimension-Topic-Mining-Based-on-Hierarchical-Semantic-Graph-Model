abstract

two time theory is derived via localization of the global sp(2)
symmetry [or osp(1/2), osp(n/2), sp(2n),...]
in phase space in or-
der to give a self contained introduction to two time theory. then it is
shown that from the two-times physics point of view theories of point
particles on many known black hole backgrounds are sp(2) gauge du-
als of one another and of course also gauge dual to all other equal
dimensional gauges from earlier two time related publications (hydro-
gen atom, ...). we reproduce the free (quantum) relativistic parti-
cle on 1+1 dimensional black hole backgrounds and 2+1 dimensional
btz ones. other 2+1 black holes and n+1 ones are touched on but
explicitely found only as cross sections of complicated (n+1)+1 back-
grounds. further we give near horizon solutions (e.g. n+1 robertson-
bertotti). since two time physics can reproduce these backgrounds
all particle actions have hidden symmetries that oftentimes have not
been noticed before or whose origin was unclear.

1 two time theory

1.1

introduction

early attempts of using two times go back as far as 1936 when paul dirac
rederived d = 3 + 1 maxwell theory from a manifestly conformally invariant
d = 4 + 2 conformal space [1]. in order to remove the additional dimensions
constraints had to be imposed articially. we will derive two time theory
from a completely dierent point of view. the need of two times follows
rather being the starting point and the constraints are supplied by the theory
itself.

the huge success of todays fundamental theories like the standard model
and general relativity is due to localizations of global gauge freedoms. there
is one global symmetry that has never been localized. it is the sp(2) symme-
try in phase space. just like one arrives at general relativity via localization
of the poincare symmetry, localizing the sp(2) symmetry in phase space tells
us that we need two times. here we will derive two time theory from this
point of view with a formalism [2] that facilitates generalizations. we will
show this for the introduction of spin. all that will be needed is to substi-
tute the sp(2) group metric with the osp(1/2) group metric. for the sp(2)
case we will derive here for the rst time black hole backgrounds from two
time theory. the derivation of two time theory and the nding of examples -
here black holes - should serve as a self contained introduction into two time
physics. we will restrict us to bosonic examples, i.e. consider only sp(2)
duals. for the motivations of two time theory please see [2] where we show
as well motivations due to considerations of m-theory. only two time theory
can give a large enough supergroup to embed m-theory, thus two time theory
should lead to m-theory but there is only a toy-model [3] yet.

1.2 derivation of two time theory

1.2.1 the general formalism

for a group with metric g and group elements j acting on a multiplet 
according to  = j (or j = j i

ji) the following is an invariant:

(1)
 6=  since one is a row and the other one a column but it will turn out

g = g



2

that i = i. for innitesimal transformations we can write j = e + g
where e is the unit matrix and  is called the generator. if  depends on a
parameter  but j may not then this is a global symmetry. in order to make
the symmetry local one introduces the covariant derivative ; = (, ga)
where a is the gauge eld and g still the group metric (we do not consider
a coupling strength.).

we choose the following for the group metric

g = g1 = g  g2 = e

in order to ensure an anti-hermitian norm and

 =   a = a

(2)

(3)

we introduce the simplest (and well known) expressions that one could
write down for an action and the lagrangian in order to get the dimension
of energy later on when  includes x and p :

s =z t

0

d

 =

1
2

; g =

1
2

, g 

1
2

a

the euler lagrange equations give the equations of motion as:

, = ga   = 
ij = 0

(4)

(5)
(6)

the latter tells us that we will only get trivial solutions if we do not write

ij = m

i n

j m n = 0

(7)

where  has at least two times and is therefore the so(d, 2) metric. for
clarity we will see all this with an example:

1.2.2 sp(2) - example

sp(2) satises the condition (2). the symmetry acts on the doublet

2 ! =  x
  1
p !

3

(8)

where (gij) =   0 1

0 !and (gij) =   0

1

1

1 0 !. the constraint (6) trans-

lates into

ij = 0  x  x = 0 = x  p = 0 = p  p

(9)

thus it follows that x and p are two light like vectors that are not parallel.
therefore they must have two time like dimensions and they must have d + 2
entries. we write x m where m  {0, 0, 1, ...} and x m is now a so(d, 2)
vector. thus we see via the localization that nature insists on two times
because this is the only way not to get a trivial theory after gauge xing
all three gauge choices that sp(2)  sl(2, r)  so(2, 1) oers. one gauge
choice means a choice of functional dependence of one of the i
m in terms of
the others or put to equal a constant for example. note that the two times
do not come from a special choice of lagrangian. we just used the simplest
lagrangian that gives us an energy x, p . taking the localisation of the
sp(2) of ordinary physics seriously is leading to the two times.

the three gauge choices x a gauge surface inside the so(d, 2) symmetric
starting space such that we are left with so(d  1, 1). the third gauge
choice xes the parametrization of the world line (t). note that we must
have one more time and one more spatial direction. we write x m where
m  {0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., d  2} . the accident sp(2)  so(2, 1) means
that we can interpret the above as conformal gravity on the world line. we
rewrite the quantization [x, p ] = ih as

igijj = ih

(10)

1.2.3 the general formalism again
m n could be diag(1,1, 1, ..., 1) or related. the global so(d, 2) contains
d-dimensional poincare symmetry iso(d  1, 1) but there is no translation
invariance in d + 2 dimensions. the so(d, 2) generators are due to noethers
theorem

1
4
for the casimirs holds classically

j m n =

[m

i gijn ]

j

cn[so(d,2)] =

1
n!

t r (ij)n  m m = 0

,that means that for all gauges one might choose later on the casimir invari-
ants specify a unique representation of so(d, 2). it completely characterizes

4

(11)

(12)

the gauge invariant physical space. the same holds for the quantized theory
but with cn[so(d,2)] 6= 0.
1.2.4 osp(1/2) - and osp(n/2) - example

osp(1/2) satises the condition (2), too. the symmetry acts on

x

ij = 0  x  x = x  p = p  p = x   = p   = 0

(14)

we have now ve constraints matching the ve parameters of osp(1/2).
we can interpret the above as conformal supergravity on the world line.
introducing another arbitrary multiplet i the scalar product g should
be hermitian and with  6=  (one is a row, the other one a column) and
for the components
(15)
follows that  is grassmanian. thus, the quantization igijj = ih (10)
leads to [x, p ] = ih again. the i = i in (15) can be shown to be
i = +i (it follows from the properties of the generator  ).
. straightforward

one might like to generalize to osp(n/2) using m

1.2.5 the general formalism again

starting with the general formalism one only needs to specify the group
metric g in order to get dierent theories. we had sp(2) for a simple point
particle, osp(n/2) for a spinning particle but we could use for example
sp(2n) for a n - particle system.

as we will see with the help of examples, the described theory is a con-
sistent and unitary quantum theory. the so(d, 2) covariant quantization
gives the casimir which for the bosonic point particle theory for example is
c2[so(d,2)] = 4c2[sp(2)]  1
4 (d2  4) where c2[sp(2)] = 0 because the physical
states are singlets in the gauge invariant sector. thus we get

c2[so(d,2)] = 

1
4

(d2  4)

(20)

and the canonical or eld theoretical quantization after gauge xing always
also [4]. this generalizes according to the group used.

2(cid:17)2
gives c2 = 1 (cid:16) d

for instance osp(n/2) leads to

c2[so(d,2)] =

1
8

(d + 2) (n  2) (d + n  2)

(21)

there have been discussions in the past [5] [6] [7] [8] of formalisms with
two times, but not including the non-trivial classical and quantum solutions
of two time physics [4]. [5] suggested an action which can be gotten from our
rst order formalism by integrating out the momenta p in the path integral or
semi-clasically by using its equation of motion. that second order formalism
was obtained with dierent reasoning and motivation [5] , and without the
concept of gauge duality.

2 1 + 1 dimensional black hole gauges

the 1 + 1 black hole is a solution of two-time theory in 2+2 dimensions by
choosing the sp(2, r) gauges x +
= 0 and solving the constraints
x 2 = x  p = 0 as follows

the metric is given by +

inserting these forms in the original sp(2, r) local and so(2, 2) global invari-
ant lagrangian [4] gives

the metric is recognized in the line element or in the last line g = n 2,
which is obtained by integrating out the momenta. this lagrangian describes
a particle moving in the background of the black hole given a suitable n.

this form shows that the system has the larger symmetry so(2, 2) whose
generators are the lorentz generators in the 2+2 dimensional space lm n =
x m p n  x n p m . in the present gauge these take a form that is quantum
ordered already:

= upu + vpv, l++ = pv

l+
l+ = pu, l+ = u2pu
l = v2pv, l+ = upu + vpv

(29)
(30)
(31)

under the so(2, 2) = sl (2, r)l  sl (2, r)r the generators may be reclas-
sied in the form

gl

2 = vpv, gl
2 = upu, gr

are the compact generators and gl,r

0  gr

1 = v2pv , (32)
1 = u2pu .(33)

where gl,r

the classical so(2, 2) symmetry transformations generated by these are

obtained by evaluating the poisson brackets u = 1

2m nnlm n , vo, which give

2m nnlm n , uo, v =

u = +u + ++0 + + + +u2 + 0 + +u,
v = +v + ++ + +0 + +0 + v2  +v.

the lagrangian density transforms as follows

this transformation is cancelled by

(cid:16) u vn 2(cid:17) = u v (, u, v)
(cid:18) 1
a22(cid:19) =  (, u, v)

a22

so that the lagrangian is invariant under so(2, 2)

 = 0.

(34)
(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

this larger symmetry of the particle action in for example the sl(2, r) /r
black hole was not noticed before.

2.1 example: the sl(2, r) /r black hole gauge

the sl(2, r) /r black hole is described in terms of the kruskal coordinates
by the line element

1  uv

8

ds2 = 

du dv
1  uv

(39)

the singularity is at uv = 1. the region outside of the horizon is given by
u  0  v or by v  0  u. the region inside the horizon is given by
u, v  0 and 1  uv  0. the forbidden region where particle geodesics
cannot penetrate classically is uv > 1. the black hole that emerges from the
11uv2 .
gauged wzw model sl(2, r) /r is reproduced with the choice n =
for lambda follows
 (, u, v) = 2+ + (++u + +v)  (v + +u) (2 + uv)

. (40)

2.2 more examples:

all 1 + 1 black holes are conformally related. in order to nd other 1 + 1
black holes or two dimensional sections of higher dimensional ones we need
only nd the right n. here we would like to show this using schwarzschild

coordinates. dening 2u = t + rand 2v = t  r the gauge becomes

(or t =  and pt = |p| for all three gauge choices). the well known black
(45)
requires dr = drn2. thus we need to integrate to get the right r from
the n that we want. the right canonical conjugate to r is pr = pn2. then
we can write the gauge in terms of r and pr via writing the gauge with r(r)
and p(pr) = prn 2(for example:p

2.3 the quantum theory

we quantize via [u, pu] = i = [v, pv].
it turns out that all operators (like
u, p, r, lm n ) are already in the ordering that makes them hermitian relative
to the eld theoretical dot product. the eld theoretical hermiticity does
not imply l = l but requires these properties when the l act on elds. the
hermiticity is then h|li = hl|i where the dot product is: h|li =
2r dd1x[(l),0 ,0 l].
 i
with the gauges written as above all lm n = x m p n  x n p m will
close correctly. for example the gl,r
have the standard
sl (2, r)l,r commutation rules among themselves

the conformal factor n does not change the at space generators in d = 2
as shown in [9]. for the eld theoretical operators that act on wave functions
write pu = iu and so on. the casimir is c2[so(d, 2)] = 0 as it should
be in two dimensions since c2 = 1  d2
4 [4]. physical states are dened via
h |2pupv| i = 0. this is the p m pm = 0 constraint due to the lagrange
multiplier a22 , here weakly enforced onto the states. this does not break
the so(d, 2) symmetry since one can check that for all the generators lm n

hpupvi =(cid:28)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16)lm n(cid:17) (pupv)  (pupv)lm n(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:29)

then the generators algebras again close correctly and the casimir is as

3 btz black hole gauges

the btz black hole [10] is a solution of 2+1 gravity with negative cosmo-
logical constant  =  1

l2 . its line element can be written

(52)

(53)

ds2 = n 2dt2 + n2d2 + 2(cid:16)n  dt + d(cid:17)2

where we work with (8gl) = 1 for convenience. further holds

(56)

the ads gauge of [9] can not only be used to describe the global ads
case but also for backgrounds that are locally ads only. the covering space
of ads space is a btz solution with negative mass and the standard method
[11] needs analytic continuations, that is it allows imaginary numbers as
values for angles and times for instance, in order to yield btz black holes
from the ads covering space. this can now be understood in a more natural
way as a sp(2) duality transformation in two time physics [4].

we start out with (124) to (126) of [9]:

m = ( 0

(60)

note that p 2 = 0 has not been imposed yet, and there still is one more

gauge freedom. this we rewrite:

m = ( 0

x m = (c, c, ss,

(61)
(62)

where c 2  s2 = 1 , c2  s2 = 1 and 2  2 = 1 such that x m xm = 0.
the upper sign will be the solution outside the event horizon and the lower

sign will give the inside solution. dx m dxm is the line element

let us concentrate from now on onwards on the outside solution just
to avoid the proliferation of . then c, c,  are or at least behave like cosh
functions in many respects and s, s,  like sinh ones. let c, s be only depen-
dent on a parameter r. using equations (58) and (60) yields the canonical

on a btz background was to our knowledge not known.

lets actually give examples for the c and s functions. for c = cosh r follows
s = sinh r and therefore p = pr. hence the line element to be compared

with (66) is

ds2 = s2(cid:16)dx+(cid:17)2

+ l2(dr)2 + c 2(cid:16)dx(cid:17)2

(89)

which holds for the outside of the black hole and is connected to more intuitive
coordinates via x = (
l  ). the equations (52) to (55) can now easily
be reproduced; i.e. this is a btz black hole with  as inner and outer event
horizons and the mass and angular momentum given by the arithmetic and
harmonic means of (

an identication to    + 2 is an identication of points as well in

4.1 ansatz with conformal gauge

the btz gauges feature rather involved operators that allow no straight
forward generalization to higher dimensions or, since they came from an ads-
gauge, not to other curvatures. the conformal gauge of the 1 + 1 solutions
given earlier can easily be generalized:

, i.e. the solutions are scalar elds on the very backgrounds given via n

[recall 2 = (cid:16)gg(cid:17)]. even for simple n it leads to non linear

pdes and all one could possibly gain are background metrics that can be
put into the conformal gauge form. two time theory becomes especially rich
with x m = x m
(x,p) but we restrict us to the conformal-gauge ansatz because
with x m = (...)(x) n(x) the metric can be found very easily.

4.2 near horizon gauges

near horizon backgrounds:

again we would like to stress that the derivation of these systems - here
particles in a curved space time - as two time theory gauges proves they have
symmetries hidden in the action that have gone unnoticed or whose origin
was clouded before and that make them so(d, 2) symmetric systems.

4.3 cross sections (cross cuts) that are black hole

be modelled with two time theory gauges. the following is the b1 = 0 cross

5 conclusions

many black hole backgrounds have been shown to be two time theory gauges.
thereby we established sp(2) gauge duality between several backgrounds.
we demonstrated that two time theory is certainly rich enough to allow for

18

and unify very many complicated systems. one should bear in mind that
all of the above was found with the help of either the ads gauge or another
rather restricted ansatz (namely the conformal gauge) but two time theory
is much richer. as well, the d + 2 gauges are dual to all the other gauges
of equal dimensionality that have been published before, as there are the
hydrogen atom and the harmonic oscillator [13] and so on.

particles in black hole backgrounds having a conformal metric and ones
near event horizons show conformal symmetries. for 1 + 1 and 2 + 1 btz
backgrounds it was explicitly shown how this symmetry which is hidden in
the action emerges from the so(d, 2) that acts linearly in the ungauged two
time space but is non linearly realized once a gauge surface is xed. as
observed in [12] and [2] already: the adsn  sm discussion may benet
from this - symmetries hidden in the action can be as vital as the lorentz
boost symmetry for a free particle (a lagrangian like l = m1  r2 or
the hamiltonian h = p2 + m2do not reveal it.).

the method of [11] has been given a natural justication. in order to go
from global ads to the black hole solution one has had to identify (make time
periodic) and complexify (use imaginary numbers for real quantities) because
both are gauges in a space time with two times. the dierence between the
gauges is how the gauge slices lie in the bigger space time. the eective
exchange of the roles of one of the times with that of one space like direction
relative to the gauge surface was formally achieved via the complexication.
the methods used here often remind of purely geometrical embeddings
in order to obtain a metric more conveniently. hence, we would like to stress
that all our gauge choices are consistent, dynamical quantum theories that
allow for introduction of spin [9] and supersymmetry [14].

i greatly beneted from many a discussion with itzhak bars. he also came
up with the sl(2, r) /r black hole gauge and made me understand that one
needs to check (47) and use not only naive hermiticity but hermiticity due
to the eld theoretical dot product. itzhak was the rst to realize that the
conformal gauge ansatz lead to (97) whose solutions are scalar elds on the
very backgrounds given.
