in these notes we explain how the cft description of random matrix models can be
used to perform actual calculations. our basic example is the hermitian matrix model,
reformulated as a conformal invariant theory of free fermions. we give an explicit operator
construction of the corresponding collective eld theory in terms of a bosonic eld on a
hyperelliptic riemann surface, with special operators associated with the branch points.
the quasiclassical expressions for the spectral kernel and the joint eigenvalue probabilities
are then easily obtained as correlation functions of current, fermionic and twist operators.
the result for the spectral kernel is valid both in macroscopic and microscopic scales. at
the end we briey consider generalizations in dierent directions.

based on the talk of the author at the third claude itzykson- meeting, integrable
models and applications to statistical mechanics , paris, july 27-29, 1998, and at the

1. introduction

the random matrix models have various applications in rather dierent domains,
and sometimes language barriers prevents the ow of ideas and knowledge from one eld
to another. for example, such powerful techniques as the conformal eld theory (cft)
description of the random matrix models and their relation with the integrable hierarchies,
which were developped extensively by the string theorists in the early 90s, are practically
unknown to the mesoscopic physicists. this lecture is an attempt to explain the uses of the
the cft description in a language, which is acceptable by both communities. we therefore
avoided any physical interpretation and concentrated on the method as such. the only
thing the reader is supposed to know are the basics of the two-dimensional conformal eld
theory.

  

the statistical ensembles of random matrices of large size (matrix models) have been
introduced in 1951 by wigner in order to analyze the spectral properties of complicated
systems with chaotic behavior [1]. in this approach the hamiltonian of a chaotic system
is considered as a large matrix with random entries. consequently, the analytical studies
of random matrix ensembles carried out in the next 25 years (see the mehtas book [2])
were oriented to the calculation of the spectral correlation functions or joint eigenvalue
probabilities.

if m is an n  n hermitian random matrix, then the spectral correlation function

(1, ..., n) is dened as the probability density that 1, ..., n are eigenvalues of m

(1, ..., n) =

n ! * n
(n  n)!
yi=1

(m  i)+ .

(1.1)

all spectral correlation functions are expressed as determinants of a single kernel k(, )
(the spectral kernel). the spectral kernel can be evaluated by the method of orthogonal
polynomials [2]. its large n asymptotics is characterized by the interposition of a smooth
behavior and fast oscillations with wavelength  1/n (in a scale where the total range of
the spectrum is kept nite). the smooth large distance behavior depends on the concrete
form of the matrix potential. on the contrary, the microscopic behavior characterized by
oscillations depends only on the symmetry group (the unitary group in the case) and fall
into several universality classes. it is the microscopic behavior of the spectral correlations,
which is interesting from the point of view of applications to chaotic systems. a review of
the latest developments in this direction, in particular these related to the recent monte
carlo data in lattice qcd, can be found in [3].
  

the discovery by t hooft of the 1/n expansion [4] gave a meaning of the smooth part
of the spectral correlators and opened the possibility of using random matrix models to
solve various combinatorial problems, the simplest of which is the enumeration of planar
graphs [5,6]. here we can mention the exact solution of various statistical models dened
on random surfaces [7,8,9], the matrix formulation of the 2d quantum gravity [10,11] and
some more dicult combinatorial problems as the enumeration of the dually weighted
planar graphs [12] and the branched coverings of a compact riemann surface [13].

1

in this kind of problems the solution is encoded in the 1/n expansion of the loop

correlation functions, which are the correlation functions of the collective eld variable

w (z) = tr(cid:16)

1

z  m(cid:17).

(1.2)

in the large n limit the correlation functions of the resolvent (1.2) are meromorphic func-
tions with cuts along the intervals where the spectral density is nonzero. the discontinuity
along the cuts gives the smooth part of the joint eigenvalue probabilities (1.1). indeed, we
have the evident relation

the rst exact results in the large n limit were obtained by direct application of
the saddle point method [5], but later it was recognized that a more powerful method
is provided by the so called loop equations [14], whose iterative solution allows one to
reconstruct order by order the 1/n expansion. the most ecient iterative procedure
proved to be the moments description [15], which allowed to calculate the free energy
and loop correlators for an arbitrary potential up to 1/n 4 terms.

in the early 90s, after the publication of the seminal papers [11], the two resolu-
tion techniques in random matrix models (orthogonal polynomials and loop equations)
developed rapidly and were recognized as particular cases of well developed mathematical
methods.

  

the method of orthogonal polynomials was reformulated in terms of the theory of
 functions of integrable hierarchies (see, for example, the review article [16]). on the
other hand it was observed that the loop equations generate a representation of (half of)
the virasoro algebra and are therefore equivalent to the requirement that the theory is
conformal invariant [17,18]. this allowed to describe a class of large n matrix models
near criticality in terms of the hilbert space of twisted bosonic elds, and apply the well
developed formalism of the conformal eld theory. finally, it was observed that the two
approaches are closely related since the  functions associated with the matrix models
can be formulated as fermionic theories with conformal invariance [19]. (the approach
based on integrable hierarchies is however less general since it works only for the unitary
ensemble of random matrices.)

  

it happened that the cft techniques were developed exclusively from the point of
view of their application to noncritical string theories, and therefore are known only to
a relatively narrow circle of physicists. the aim of this lecture is to demonstrate the
technical and conceptual advantages of the conformal eld theory description in a more
general setting. in particular, we will reproduce, using the cft formalism, the microscopic
oscillations of the spectral kernel and correlators. the cft formalism allows to understand
better the origin of the observed universality at mesoscopic and microscopic scales.

2

we will restrict ourselves to the simplest example of the hermitian one matrix model
with arbitrary potential and will only briey consider the generalizations at the end. first
we will establish the equivalence of the unitary matrix ensemble with a system of two-
dimensional free chiral fermions. then we will construct the collective eld theory, which
is obtained from the fermionic system by the two-dimensional bosonization rules. the eld
posesses a nontrivial expectation value associated with a hyperelliptic riemann surface.
the latter is described, from the point of view of cft, by a collection of twist operators
associated with its branch points. with interaction concentrated at the branch points. we
will demonstrate the power of the cft description by performing some actual calculations.
we will obtain the quasiclassical expressions for the correlator of the resolvent w (z), the
joint eigenvalue probabilities and the spectral kernel. finally we will briey mention how
the formalism can be generalized to the case of a chain of coupled random matrices in
presence of external matrix elds.

2. the hermitian one matrix model. loop equations as virasoro constraints

the partition function of the unitary ensembleis dened as the integral

zn [v ] =z dm etrv (m )

(2.1)

where dm denotes the translational invariant measure in the space of n  n hermitian
matrices m = {mij}n

i,j=1. we normalize the measure as

dm =

1

vol[u (n )]

n

yk=1

2 dre(mkj) dim(mkj)

(2.2)

where vol[u (n )] = qn

k!
potential is an entire function

(2)k

k=1

is the volume of the unitary group. we assume that the

v (m ) = 

tnm n



xn=0

(2.3)

which is the natural choice for the ensemble of hermitian matrices.

the integrand depends on the matrix variable m only through its eigenvalues

1, ..., n and the integral (2.1) is actually reduced to

zn [v ] =

1

n ! z

n

yi=1

(2.4)

(we used the notation zn [t] instead of zn [v ] since a concrete representation of the the
potential v (z) by the set {tn}n=0 of coordinates (coupling constants) is chosen.) the
operators ln satises the virasoro algebra

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n

4

(2.14)

which implies that the this matrix integral realizes a representation of the conformal group.
in writing the virasoro constraints we introduced the derivative with respect to the trivial
variable t0, which satises


t0zn [t] = nzn [t].

(2.15)

it turns to be much simpler to use apparatus of the conformal eld theory instead
of solving directly the loop equations (2.12). the formal solution of these equations is
given in terms of a chiral dirac fermion or, through bosonization, of a chiral bosonic
eld with liouville-like interaction, which is by its denition conformal invariant. such a
construction has been proposed in [18,19].

in the next sections we consider the cft interpretation of the matrix model from
more pragmatic point of view than in refs. [18,19]. our aim is explore the large n limit of
the operator solution of the loop equations through the conformal eld theory and repro-
duce the 1/n expansion for the free energy and the correlation functions. the bosonic eld
can be considered as the collective eld describing the dyson gas of eigenvalues. the 1/n
expansion can be constructed in terms of a free bosonic eld dened on a riemann sur-
face determined by the classical background (the spectral density in the thermodynamical
limit). the spectral correlations can be determined directly from the correlation functions
of this bosonic eld.

3. fermionic representation

3.1. fock space representation of the hermitian matrix integral in terms of dirac fermions

the model (2.1) was rst solved by the so called method of orthogonal polynomials
[20,21]. the method is based on the possibility to consider the matrix model as a system
of free fermions. later the fermionic partition function was identied as a  -function of
the kp hierarchy [19]. (for a review of the theory of tau-functions see [22].)

there are dierent fermionic representations of the matrix integral depending on the
choice of the fermionic wave functions. below we will describe the one that is most natural
from the point of view of the conformal symmetry. let us introduce the chiral fermions

(z) =(cid:26) (1) (z)

(2) (z)(cid:27) , (z) = {(1)(z), (2)(z)} .

(3.1)

choosing a local coordinate 1/z at z =  we expand

(a)(z) = xrzz+ 1

2

r zr 1
(a)
2 ,

(a)(z) = xrzz+ 1

2

(a)
r

zr 1
2 .

(3.2)

where the fermion modes satisfy the anticommutation relations

[(a)

r , (b)
r

]+ = a,br+r,0.

(3.3)

5

the left and right vacuum states of given charge ~l = (l

(1)

(2)

, l

) are dened by

r = h~l|(a)
h~l|(a)
r |~li = (a)
(a)

r = 0
|~li = 0

r

(r < l(a) )

(r > l(a) )

(3.4)

and the corresponding normal ordering is denoted by :

:. the action of the chiral fermions

is s =r d2z  and the energy-momentum tensor is t = 1

the fermion bilinears

2 [  ].

j (a)(z) =: (a)(z)(a)(z) :
j+(z) = (1) (2)(z), j(z) = (2)(1)(z)

(a = 1, 2)

(3.5)

satisfy the u(2) current algebra.

the currents j (a) (z) = pn j (a)

the fermionic elds as

n zn1, jn(a) = przz+

r

[j (a)

n , (a)(z)] = zn(a)(z),
] = (a)
rn

[j (a)

n , j (a)

m ] = nn+m,0.

we will also denote the su(2) current components by

e+(z) = j+(z),
e(z) = j(z),
h(z) =

1
2

[j (1) (z)  j (2)(z)]

and the u(1) current by

h(z) =

1
2

[j (1)(z) + j (2) (z)].

the su2 currents are expressed in terms of the pauli matrices as

h =: 3 : ,
e =:  :

.

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

now we are ready to write the fock-space representation of the matrix partition
function (2.1) in terms of the fermionic elds (3.1). for this purpose we dene the hamil-
tonian

d e+().

statement:

the scalar product

zn [v ] = hn|eh[v ] eq+|0i ,

where |0i  |0, 0i and hn|  hn, n|, is equal to the integral (2.4).

proof:

(3.11)

(3.12)

first we expand eq+ in fermion multilinears and move the operator eh[v ] to the right

using the formulas

eh[v ](2)(z)eh[v ] = e 1
eh[v ](1)(z)eh[v ] = e 1

2 v (z)(2)(z),

2 v (z)(1)(z),

(3.13)

until it hits the right vacuum. the result is1

zn [v ] = hn|eqv

+|0i, qv

+ =z 



d(1)()(2)() ev ().

(3.14)

then, expanding the exponent in modes

qv

+ = xr,r>0z dr+r1(1)
r (2)

r ev ()

(3.15)

and using (3.3) and (3.4), we reproduce the original integral.

the representation (3.12) of the partition function implies that the latter is a  -
function of the kp hierarchy (this fact has been established in [23]) and therefore satises
an innite tower of dierential equations, the rst of which is the kp equation.

1 here we assume that the potential grows suciently fast at    and therefore the

integral is nite if the fermionic operator is regular at z = 0. this is indeed the case since all r

with r > 0 are annihilated by the right vacuum.

3.2. relation to the method of orthogonal polynomials

the method of orthogonal polynomials [20] consists, in this setting, in choosing a basis

diagonalizing the quadratic form (3.15)

(3.16)

where the polynomials pn(z) = zn + ... satisfy the orthogonal relations

(3.17)

the operators b(1)

n

and b(2)


n are linear combinations of (1)

r and (2)

r respectively:

b(1)

n =xk

b(2)

n =xk

bnk(2)

k 1

2

(3.18)

where the matrix b is triangular and with with unitary diagonal elements

bnn = 1, bnk = 0 for k > n

(3.19)

and therefore its determinant is equal to one, det b = 1.

introducing the set of orthogonal functions

fn() = pn1()e 1

2 v (z), n = 1, 2, ...

(3.20)

such that (fk, fj) r dfk()fj() = kj hk, we represent the quadratic form (3.15) as

and the partition function equals

(3.22)

3.3. spectral kernel and joint eigenvalue distributions

we write the partition function as

(3.26)

since we have a system of free fermions, the average is equal to the determinant of

the two-point correlators [20]

where

detnnk(i, j)

k(, ) = h(1)()(2)()i .

(3.27)

(3.28)

the two-point function (3.28) is called spectral kernel and is expressed in terms of the
orthogonal functions (3.20) as

k(, ) =

.

n

(3.29)

another useful representation of (1, ..., n) is as the correlators of the cartan current

this relation generates a set of ward identities the simplest of which is

information about the spectral correlators is also contained in the discontinuities of the
correlators of h(z).

3.4. virasoro constraints and hirota equations

we give here another derivation of the virasoro constraints, using the fock space
representation of the partition function. the level-1 u(2) current algebra satised by the
operators (3.5) decouples into u(1) and su(2)1 parts. the corresponding sugawara energy-
momentum tensor also decouples to two noninteracting pieces

where

t (z) =

t (z) = : h 2(z) :

(3.32)

(3.33)

and h and h are given by (3.7) and (3.8) respectively. both pieces commute with the
operator eq+, which means that theory is conformal invariant. only the operator t (z) =

pn lnzn2 produces nontrivial ward identities. for any n  1,

[ln, q+] =z

since our potential diverges as   , the boundary terms of can be neglected, and we
have
(3.35)
on the other hand, by commuting ln, n  1 with eh[v ] we nd the nontrivial linear
dierential equations (2.12) known as virasoro constraints.
the partition function is by construction a  -function of the kp hierarchy [18], zv [t] =
n [t], where the times tn are the coecients in the expansion of the potential v (z) =
pn=1 tnzn. it is a particular case of the general solution of the kp hierarchy presented

in [22] and satises the bilinear hirota equations

4. bosonic representation

in most of the applications associated with the large n limit we are interested not in
the exact expressions in terms of determinants of strongly oscillating fermionic eigenfunc-
tions (typically they have n nodes), but in the smooth eective expressions. in this sense
it is more advantageous to develop the theory of the collective excitations of fermions for
which the small parameter 1/n 2 plays the role of a planck constant and whose ground
state is the equilibrium state of the dyson gas. the free boson representation is very useful
to study the large n limit of the theory.

5. quasi-classics

5.1. ground state

in the large n limit the bosonic eld  = (1)(2)

develops a large (of order n ) vac-
uum expectation value c(z) = h(z)i which is a solution of classical virasoro constraints

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

where m (z) is an entire function of z.

the classical current has discontinuities along the intervals [a2k1, a2k]. in the case
of a single cut, the conditions (5.1) and (5.3) are sucient for reconstructing the ground
state. in the case of several cuts the situation is more complicated. the potential v (z)
then has p minima along the real axis (we assume that it grows at innity) so that the

13

spectral density () = 1
2in [hc( + i0) hc( + i0)] splits into p discontinuous pieces k.
each partition n1, ..., np (n1 + ... + np = n ) giving the distribution of the eigenvalues
between the p minima denes a metastable state. the tunneling events leading to the
decay of the the metastable state are of order en which means that in the large n limit
the metastable states are actually stable. the true ground state is determined by requiring
that the tunnelling amplitude between two neighboring vacua vanish, which yields p  1
additional conditions xing the lling numbers n1, . . . , np.
the classical eld c = 12h(1)  (2)i changes its sign after circling a branch point.
this means that the the expectation values of the two original bosonic elds (1) (z) and
(2) (z) are given by the two branches of the meromorphic function (5.3). therefore one can
speak of a single eld ~(z) = {(1)(z), (2) (z)} dened on the two-fold branched covering
of the complex plane given by the hyper-elliptic riemann surface y2 =q2p
k=1(z  ak), the
two sheets of which are sewed along the p cuts [a2k1, a2k].

a. one-cut solution

the classical eld depends on n and on the potential v (z) directly and through the
positions a1, a2 of the two branch points. a simple but important observation (made rst
by v. kazakov) is that the derivative with respect to n of the resolvent of the random
matrix (the expectation value hc(z) in our interpretation) depends only on the positions
of the branch points. indeed, according to the normalization condition

the derivative hc/n satises

i hc(z)

hc

and therefore behaves as 1/z at z  . the only analytic function of the form (5.3) with
this asymptotics is

b. multi-cut solutions

the above analysis can be carried out in the general case of a classical solution with an
arbitrary number of cuts. assuming that the branch points are ordered as a1 < ... < a2p,
we have

(it is sucient to add only p  1 such conditions in order to determine a1, ..., a2p.)
the quasiclassical problem with several cuts has been considered in [27,28,29]. the
authors of [29] nd a unique solution (the true vacuum) because they impose conditions
equivalent to the requirement that the tunelling amplitudes between the dierent classical
vacua are zero.

2 the period matrix is generally overdetermined. the condition that the the period matrix
describes a riemann surface (shottkey problem) is that the corresponding theta function is a

tau-function of kp (krichevers conjecture proved by shiota and mulase).

16

5.2. quasi-classical expansion



xg=0

the quasiclassical expansion of the free energy fn = lnzn is actually the 1/n

expansion

fn [v ] =

n 22gf (g)[v /n ] + nonperturbative terms.

(5.19)

it is also called genus expansion because the term f (g) represents the sum of all connected
feynman diagrams of genus g.

the leading term (o(n 2)) is simply the action for for the classical bosonic eld

n 2f (0) = n 2zdd()() ln(  )  nz d()v ()

=

4 z d2zc c

2i dz

2i

v (z)c(z).

(5.20)

the next term (o(1)) is produced by the gaussian uctuations around the classical
solution c. it is most easily calculated by considering the riemann surface as the complex
plane with two twist operators associated with its branch points. the notion of a twist
operator has been introduced by al. zamolodchikov [30] (see also [31]). the twist oper-
ators, which are conformal operators with dimension 1/16, can be represented as vertex
operators

+(z) = : e

(z) = : e

4 [(2) (z)(1) (z)] : = : e 1

(z) :

(z) :

(z = a2k1),
(z = a2k).

(5.21)

the twist operators are not conformal invariant and have to be dressed by the modes
of the bosonic eld in order to obtain translational invariant invariant star operators [32].
one can construct perturbatively the star operators s(ak) out of the modes of the twisted
bosonic eld (the descendants of the twist operator (ak)), by requiring that the singular
terms with their ope with the energy-momentum tensor vanish. then the free energy can
be evaluated as the logarithm of the correlation function of the 2p star operators.

the star operators read

let us nd the explicit expression for the o(1) term f (1). up to 1/n 2 corrections,
s(a2k1) = [(a2k1)] 1
where (a)  ha dz(z  a)3/2(z) is the coecient in front of the power (z  a)1/2 in

the mode expansion of (z) at the point z = a. using the explicit expression for the
correlation function of the twist operators we nd

24 +(a2k1), s(a2k) = [(a2k)] 1

24 (a2k)

(k = 1, . . . , p)

f (1) = loghs(a1) . . . s(a2p)i =

this expression generalizes the one-cut solution found in [15] by solving directly the loop
equations.

the evaluation in this way of the next term f (2) requires more work, but is still
much more simple than the direct iteration of the loop equations. (the result of [15] was
obtained with the help of mathematica, and i reproduced all the coecients, except the
rst one, using only my pen.)

6. two-point correlators for one-cut background

6.1. the two-point correlator of the resolvent

the connected correlation function of the resolvent

w (z, z) =(cid:28)tr
is related to that of the current h = 12

 by

1

2h+(z)+(z)i

1

1

(z  z)2(cid:19) .

(6.1)

(we remind that + is the singular at z = 0 part of the eld .) therefore, in order to
evaluate w (z, z), we need the expression for the two-point correlator of the gaussian eld
(z) dened on the riemann surface with a cut along the interval [a1, a2]  [a, b]. the
latter can be evaluated as the 4-point function of two current and two twist operators

h(z)(z)ic = h0|(z)(z)+(a)



(b)|0i

.

(6.2)

= ln(cid:0)p(z  a)(z  b) p(z  b)(z  a)(cid:1)

this function has a nontrivial monodromy, and the determination of the square roots
depends on whether the two elds belong to the same or to dierent sheets the riemann
surface. the correlator can be also determined from the condition that it behaves as
ln(z  z) at short distances and that it has the same analytic structure as the background
eld c(z). the sum over the four terms gives of course the two-point correlator on the
plane:

h(a)(z)(a ) (z)i = ln[(z)  (z)],

(z) = (z  a)(z  b).

xa,a

we have to calculate the correlator of the eld (z) = (1)(2)

which is antisymmetric
with respect to the zz2 monodromy. taking the alternated sum over the four branches of
(6.2), we get

2

h(z)(z)ic = lnp(z  a)(z  b) p(z  b)(z  a)
p(z  a)(z  b) +p(z  b)(z  a)

dierentiating twice, we obtain for the current correlator

6.2. the quasiclassical expression for the spectral kernel

the quasiclassical evaluation of the spectral kernel can be done as well, but in this
case it is not so easy to control the approximation. again we split the bosonic eld  into a
classical and quantum parts and consider the quantum part as a free eld on the riemann
surface. the kernel (3.28) is expressed in the free eld approximation as a correlation
function of vertex operators

k(, ) = h: e(1) () : : e(2) () :i.

(6.5)

as in the case of the resolvent, we rst write the quasiclassical expression for the four-point
function of two vertex and two twist operators

g(z, z) = h0| : e(z) : : e(z) : +(a)
z  z  (cid:20) (z  a)(z  b)

+(cid:20) (z  b)(z  a)

(6.6)

where we have used that h(z)i =  12
c(z), the sign depending on whether the eld is
evaluated on the upper or the lower sheet of the riemann surface. the overall coecient
is determined by the behavior at z  z where we have to reproduce 12
c(z) = i(z).
the branch of c(z) has to be chosen so that g(z) decays exponentially at innity.
four values of this function on both sides of the cut [a, b]

the kernel k(, ) is dened on the real axis and is obtained as the average over the

k(, ) =

1

4i x,=

g( + i0,  + i0).

(6.7)

(the average should be taken because of the ambiguity due to presence of the cut; this
ambiguity of g appears only in the large n limit.) one nds explicitly, for ,   [a, b]

k(, ) =

this expression coinsides with the one obtained in [33] and in [34,35] by solving the ap-
propriate loop equations.

when ,   [a, b] and     1/n , one obtains the well known short distance

behavior

k(, ) =

sin[n (  )( +
2 ])

(  )

.

(6.9)

in the case when one of the arguments is outside the eigenvalue interval, the exponent is
real and negative and the spectral kernel decays rapidly.

7. generalization to chains of random matrices

the most natural generalization of the cft construction is given by the ade matrix
models [8], which were introduced as a nonperturbative microscopic realization of the
rational string theories with c < 1. each one of these models is associated with a rank
r classical simply laced lie algebra (that is, of type ar, dr, e6,7,8) or its ane extension,
and represents a system of r coupled random matrices.

here we will discuss only the models of the a-series, for which there exists a simple
fermionic representation. the model associated with ar = su(r + 1) represents a chain
of r hermitian matrices ma of size na  na (a = 1, ..., r), interacting by means of r  1
auxiliary gauge-eld-like rectangular complex matrix variables aa (a = 1, ..., r  1) of size
na  na+1. in this way the ma and aa are associated respectively with the nodes and the
links of the dynkin diagram of ar. the partition function of the matrix chain is given by
the following integral

z ~n [~v ] =z y

r

ya=1

dma etrv a(ma)z

r1

ya=1

daadaa etraaaa matraa aama+1 .

(7.1)

after integrating with respect to the a-matrices and the angular variables of the m -
matrices, the partition function reduces to an integral with respect of the eigenvalues
ai, i = 1, ..., na, of the hermitian matrices ma

z ~n [~v ] =z

ya=1yi

dai epi

v a(ai) yi<j

(ai  aj )2

ya=1yi,j

(ai + a+1,j)

.

(7.2)

important remark: the integral with respect to the a-matrices exists only if all eigenvalues
of the matrices ma are positive. this can be achieved by an appropriate choice of the
potential. we will thus assume that the integration is restricted to the positive real axis
a > 03.

let c+ be a contour representing the boundary of the half-plane rez > 0. using the
fact that the eigenvalue integration is restricted to the positive real axis, we can write the
following loop equations for each a

(7.3)

the representation of this integral as a fock space expectation value is a gener-
alization of the su(2) construction of sect.3. now we consider r + 1 fermion elds
(a)(z), a = 1, ..., r + 1, whose modes in the expansion (3.2) satisfy the anticommuta-
]+ = rsab, so that the bilinears j (a)(z) =: (a)(z)(a)(z) :,

the riemann surface dened by the classical solution represents an (r + 1)-fold covering
of the complex plane which has in the simplest case two cuts [a, b] and [b, a] on the real
axis (0 < a < b). the elds (a) represent the values on the dierent sheets of a single
meromorphic eld (z). the quasiclassical expressions for the correlation functions and
the free energy are obtained by introducing 2r twist operators

associated with the points a, b. in the limit a  0, b   the r twist operators located
at the points b and b merge into a zzr twist operator at the origin while the rest form a
zzr twisted boundary condition at innity. in this case the bosonic description is given by
the zzn twisted eld considered in refs. [17].

8. another generalization: the hermitian matrix model as an amplitude be-
tween two gl(n ) representations

our cft representation actually holds for a more general class of matrix models,
containing external matrix sources. the source can be introduced by replacing the left
vacuum state with an excited state. consider the integral

zr(1) ,r(2) [v ] =z dm etrv (m )

r(1) (m )

r(2) (m )

(8.1)

where r(1) and r(2) are the characters of two polynomial representations of the group
u (n ). the polynomial representation r is labeled by the young tableau

and the corresponding character is given by a ratio of two determinants

yr = {l1  l2  ...  ln}

r (m ) =

i

det(cid:16)j1+lnj+1
i (cid:17)
det(cid:16)j1

(cid:17)

(i, j = 1, ..., n ).

(8.2)

therefore the partition function can be written again as an integral over the eigenvalues

the quasiclassical expressions for the spectral correlations depend on the nontrivial
left vacuum only through the classical eld c and are therefore given again by (6.4) and
(6.8). the virasoro constraints are however more complicated because the left vacuum
state is not annihilated by the negative components of the current.

9. concluding remarks

1

the cft representation of the matrix models originates in the su (n ) invariant ma-
trix integration measure and therefore can be actually constructed for all matrix models.
in a system of several or even innitely many interacting random matrices, one can asso-
and a vacuum |0ai, which
ciate with each matrix variable ma a current ja(z) = tr
is invariant with respect to conformal transformations generated by the sugawara stress-
energy tensor ta(x)  j 2
a (z). in the large n limit all other matrices interacting with ma
can be reduced to an eective matrix mean eld, which will plays the role of the potential
v in our analysis of the hermitian matrix model. the classical virasoro constraints (5.1)
hold again, but the eective potential can have cuts and poles. the virasoro generators do
not have in general a simple representation as linear dierential operators as the virasoro
constraints (2.12). the classical background is described by a riemann surface, which is
in general not a hyperelliptic one. the hilbert space associated with the matrix variable
from the cuts of
ma corresponds to a contour separating the cuts of the resolvent tr
the eective potential.

the usefulness of the cft approach consists in the fact that once the classical solu-
tion a(z) is found, the loop correlators and the spectral kernel are given by the universal
expressions (6.4) and (6.8). in this sense observed universality of the short distance be-
havior of the loop correlators and the spectral kernel is a rather trivial consequence of the
conformal invariance. it is also possible to construct a universal loop diagram technique
for the 1/n corrections, one particular case of which is considered in ref. [36].
