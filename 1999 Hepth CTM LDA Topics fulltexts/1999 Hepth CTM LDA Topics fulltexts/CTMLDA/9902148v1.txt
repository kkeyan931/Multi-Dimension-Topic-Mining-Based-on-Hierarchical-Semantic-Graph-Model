1 introduction

exact spherically symmetric solutions describing generalized analogues of black holes in
an arbitrary number of dimensions have an interesting history and have recently received
renewed attention mainly in eorts to obtain a framework for a unied theory, for example
in the context of strings or p-branes.

the rst multidimensional generalization of such type was considered by d. kramer [1]
and rediscovered by a.i. legkii [2], d.j. gross and m.j. perry [3] (and also by a. davidson
and d. owen [4], see also [5]). in [6] the schwarzschild solution was generalized to the
case of n internal ricci-at spaces and it was shown that a black hole conguration takes
place when the scale factors of the internal spaces are constants.
in [7], an analogous
generalization of the tangherlini solution [8] was obtained. these solutions were also
extended to the electrovacuum [9, 10, 12] and dilatonic [13, 12] cases. (we remind that
the multidimensional o(d + 1)-symmetric analogue of the well-known reissner-nordstrom
charged black hole solution was obtained earlier by r. c. myers and m. j. perry [11].)
a theorem was proved in [12] that cuts all non-black-hole congurations as non-stable
under even monopole perturbations.

in [15] the extremely-charged dilatonic black hole solution was generalized to the mul-
ticenter (majumdar-papapetrou) case when the cosmological constant is non-zero. (the
d = 4 majumdar-papapetrou solutions with conformal scalar and electromagnetic elds
were considered already in [16].) in [17, 18], the majumdar-papapetrou type solutions
with composite intersecting p-branes (in theories with elds of forms) 5 corresponding to
ricciat internal spaces were obtained and generalized to the case of einstein internal
spaces. earlier some special classes of these solutions were considered in [29][34]. the
obtained solutions take place when certain orthogonality relations (on coupling parame-
ters, dimensions of branes, total dimension) are imposed. in such a situation, one may
have a new class of cosmological and spherically symmetric solutions [35]. special cases
were also considered in [36]-[39]. solutions with a horizon were studied in detail in [40]-
[43], [35]. in [43, 44] some propositions related to i) the interconnection between hawking
temperature and singularity behaviour and ii) multitemporal congurations were proved.
it should be noted that the multidimensional and multitemporal generalizations of the
schwarzschild and tangherlini solutions were considered in [10, 45] wherein generalized
newtons formulas for the multitemporal case were obtained.

the plan of this letter is as follows. in section 2, we consider p-brane black hole (bh)
solutions with block-orthogonal intersection rules [18] (see also [44]) and provide an
example of a black hole solution in d = 11 supergravity [46]. the metric of this solution
contains the reissner-nordstrom metric as a 4-dimensional section.
in section 3, the
post-newtonian parameters  and  corresponding to 4-dimensional section of the metric
are calculated and a family of solutions with  = 1, corresponding to electro-magnetic
pairs of p-branes is singled out. some comments of a more general nature are given in the
last section.

5for non-composite electric case see [20, 21], for composite electric case see [22], for solutions with
intersections governed by lie algebras see [19]. for other solutions with p-branes see also [23]-[28] and
references therein.

the solution given above describes non-extremal charged intersecting generalized p-
branes with block-diagonal matrix b and agrees in some particular cases with those given
in refs. [40, 41, 42] (d1 = . . . = dn = 1), [43] for the non-composite case and [35] for the
case of diagonal b (i.e. when |s1| = . . . = |sk| = 1). note also that the special case of our
solution with the parameters 2
s for all s, s  si,
i = 1, . . . , k) was analyzed also in [44].

we now note that the metric (2.11) has a horizon at r d = 2. the hawking tem-
perature corresponding to the solution is (see also [42, 43] for orthogonal case) found to
be

(2.37)

therefore, for xed ps > 0 and   +0, we deduce th ()  0 for the extremal black

(2.40)

it is instructive to give some examples that show the behaviour of our solution in some

simple cases.

example 1: reissner-nordstrom solution. our solutions contain the reissner-

nordstrom solution (for a charged black hole) as a special case, namely,

g = h 2(cid:26) dr  dr

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.43)

(p )2 = p (p + 2) and p > 0 is constant. introducing the new radial variable r = r + p ,
we may rewrite this solution in a more familiar form, namely,

g = f dt  dt + r2d 2

2 + f 1dr  dr,

f =

with gm =  + p . (here g is gravitational constant, m is mass and p  is charge.)

example 2: d= 11 supergravity. consider the truncated bosonic sector of d = 11
supergravity ( truncated means without chern-simons terms). the action (2.1) in this
case reads

str = zm

(2.47)

where rankf = 4. in this particular case, consider the dyonic black-hole solutions with
electric 2-brane and magnetic 5-brane dened on the manifold

m = (2, +)  s2  ir  m2  m3,

(2.48)

where dimm2 = 2 and dimm3 = 5. the metric and 4-form eld then read as follows,

g = h 2(cid:26) dr  dr

(c = const, f = da), since the only modication related to maxwells equations

d  f = const f  f,

(2.51)

(2.52)

is trivial due to f  f = 0 (since i  i = 0).

this solution describes two p-branes (electric 2-brane and magnetic 5-brane) with
equal charges intersecting on the time manifold. in the extremal case,   0, this solution
corresponds to the so-called a2-dyon solution from [18]. we see that the 4-dimensional
section of the metric (2.49) coincides with the reissner-nordstrom metric (2.41).

3 post-newtonian approximation

let d0 = 2 and consider the 4-dimensional section of the metric (2.11), namely,

g(4) = u(cid:26) dr  dr

1  2/r

+ r2d 2

2  u1(cid:18)1

r (cid:19) dt  dt(cid:27),

(3.53)

in the range r > 2. we imagine that some real astrophysical objects (e.g. stars) may
be described by the 4-dimensional physical metric (3.53), i.e. they are traces of extended
multidimensional objects (charged p-branes). introducing a new radial variable  by the
relation

r =  1 +



2!2

,

(3.54)

( > /2), we may rewrite the metric (3.53) in the 3-dimensional conformally-at form,

2(cid:17)2
g(4) = u(u1(cid:16)1  
2(cid:17)2 dt  dt + 1 +
(cid:16)1  

where 2 = |x|2 = ijxixj (i, j = 1, 2, 3).

(3.55)

for possible physical applications, one should calculate the post-newtonian parameters

 and  (eddington parameters) using the following standard relations

g(4)
00 = (1  2v + 2v 2) + o(v 3),
g(4)
ij = ij(1 + 2v ) + o(v 2),

i, j = 1, 2, 3, where,

v =

(3.56)

(3.57)

(3.58)

from (3.55)-(3.58) we deduce the formulas

the parameter  is dened by the charges p

s of p-branes (or more correctly by the charge

and  = 1 (as for the schwarzschild solution) only if all p

(3.63)

(3.64)

examples 1 and 2 imply that the same parameters appear in the 4-dimensional section of
the d = 11 supergravity solution.

the results obtained above suggest that there exist non-trivial p-brane congurations

with  = 1. that this is indeed the case is shown by the following

proposition. let the set of p-branes consist of several pairs of electric and magnetic
branes and let any such pair (s, s  s) correspond to the same colour index, i.e. as = as
and the charge parameters are equal, i.e. ps = ps. then,

 = 1.

(3.65)

the proposition can be readily proved using the relation d(is)+d(is) = d2 following

from (2.30).

further, for small ps (ps  ) we obtain

ps  (p

(3.66)

(3.67)

as a last example of our procedure, let us consider the special case of one p-brane. here
we have,

s = d(is) 1 

d(is)

d  2! + 2

as,

(3.68)

and with the help of eqs. (3.60), (3.61) and (3.68) we see that for large enough values of
the dilatonic coupling constant it is possible to perform a ne tuning of the parameters
(, ) near the point (1,1) even if the charges p 

s are big.

4 conclusions

in this letter, we analyzed the basic features of pbrane black hole solutions and described
some of the better known black hole spacetimes as limiting cases of pbrane black holes.
a restriction to the 4dimensional sector of these metrics allowed the determination of
the postnewtonian parameters ,  and in particular, it was shown how a new family of
solutions having  = 1 could be singled out.

our results allow a number of more general comments to be made. firstly, there is
the question of the stability of our pbrane black holes under small perturbations away
from our static congurations. it is known that in the multidimensional case, the class of
metrics which are stable against monopole perturbations is of measure zero in the space
of all possible spherically symmetric solutions [12]. therefore a more general problem of
stability of multidimensional black holes involving other types of perturbations has to be
formulated and studied.

9

secondly, it would be of interest to develop more general aspects of pbrane black
holes addressing issues such as the area theorem and the laws of pbrane black hole
thermodynamics in this generalized context. does the nondecreasing of area in the four
dimensional sector imply an area theorem for the full multidimensional case? we leave
such matters for the future.
