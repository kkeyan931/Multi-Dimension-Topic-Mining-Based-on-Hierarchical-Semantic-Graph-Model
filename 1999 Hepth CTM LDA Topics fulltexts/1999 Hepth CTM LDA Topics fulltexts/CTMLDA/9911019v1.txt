abstract

we consider, in a string theory framework, physical processes of phenomenological

interest in models with a low string scale. the amplitudes we study involve tree-

level virtual gravitational exchange, divergent in a eld-theoretical treatment, and

massive gravitons emission, which are the main signatures of this class of models.

first, we discuss the regularization of summations appearing in virtual gravitational

(closed string) kaluza-klein exchanges in type i strings. we argue that a convenient

manifestly ultraviolet convergent low energy limit of type i string theory is given

by an eective eld theory with an arbitrary cuto  in the closed (gravitational)

channel and a related cuto m 2

s / in the open (yang-mills) channel. we nd the

leading string corrections to the eld theory results. second, we calculate exactly

string tree-level three and four- point amplitudes with gauge bosons and one massive

graviton and examine string deviations from the eld-theory result.

introduction and summary of the results.

2

shortly after the birth of string theory as a theory of hadronic interactions with a

mass scale of the order of nucleon masses, it was realized that string theory is actually

the natural framework to quantize gravity [1]. for a long time, the phenomenologically

most interesting theories were considered to be the heterotic strings, where the string scale

is of the order of the planck scale. this rendered string theory predictions not directly

accessible to current or future accelerators. recent progress in the understanding of string

dualities and d-branes [2] led to other string constructions [3], where the string scale can

have values directly accessible in future accelerators.

consequently, a lot of eorts were made in order to understand the main features of low-

scale string theories, from the point of view of possible existence of submilimeter dimensions

which can provide testable deviations from the newton law [4], gauge coupling unication

[5] and corresponding string embedding [6]. the main interest of these theories comes from

their possible testability at the future colliders, through the direct production or indirect

(virtual) eects of kaluza-klein states [7] in various cross-sections. this paper is devoted

to the (type i) string computations of the relevant amplitudes. for the convenience of the

reader we provide in the following a brief summary of our results.

a subtle issue concerning the virtual eects of gravitational kaluza-klein particles is

that for a number of compact dimensions d  2 the corresponding eld theory summations
diverge in the ultraviolet (uv). indeed, let us consider a four-fermion interaction of particles

stuck on a d3 brane mediated by kaluza-klein gravitational excitations orthogonal to it.

then the amplitude of the process, depicted in figure 1, reads

squared center of mass energy1. the summation clearly diverges for d  2.

the traditional attitude to adopt in this case is to cut the sums for masses heavier than

a cuto  >> r1

 , of the order of the fundamental scale ms in the string theory [7] . this

can be implemented in a proper-time representation of the amplitude

the following in the region of the parameter space r2
s >> 1, r >> 1 and s << 2
in which the available energy is smaller (but not far away) from the uv cuto  but

much bigger than the (inverse) compact radius r1

 , of submilimeter size. in this case, the

amplitude can be evaluated to give

high sensitivity of the result on the cuto asks for a more precise computation in a full

type i string context. this is one of the aims of this paper. in what follows we present

qualitatively the results which we derive in section 3.

the computation in the following is done for the so(32) type i 10d superstring com-

pactied down to 4d on a six-dimensional torus. however, as we shall argue later on, the

result holds for a large class of orbifolds, including n = 2 and n = 1 supersymmetric vacua
[8]. the type i string diagram which contains in the low-energy limit the gravitational

exchange mentioned above is the nonplanar cylinder diagram depicted in fig.2, in which

for simplicity we prefer to put gauge bosons instead of fermions in the external lines. this

diagram has a twofold dual interpretation [9] a) tree-level exchange of closed-string states,

if the time is chosen to run horizontally (see fig. 3) b) one-loop diagram of open strings,

if the time runs vertically in the diagram (see fig. 4). in the two dual representations, the

nonplanar amplitude reads symbolically

(1.4)

where l denotes the cylinder parameter in the tree-level channel and 2 = 1/l is the one-loop

open string parameter. in the rst representation, the amplitude is interpreted as tree-level

exchange of closed-string particules of mass (n2

s , where n1    nd are
winding quantum numbers and n is the string oscillator number. in particular the n = 0

1 +    n2

d)r2m 4

term reproduces the eld-theory result (1.1) and therefore the full expression (1.4) is its

string regularization. in the second representation, the amplitude is interpreted as a sum

of box diagrams with particles of masses (m2

1 +    m2

d)/r2 + kim 2

s (i = 1   4) running in

the four propagators of the diagram.

(2  ) of the box diagram. in particular, in four dimensions when an ir regulator 
is introduced in the box diagram, the divergence in the kaluza-klein (kk) summation in

the gravitational-exchange diagram cancels out. the nal result for the nonplanar cylinder

amplitude in the low energy limit e/ms << 1 (e is a typical energy scale), which is one of

the main results of this paper to be discussed in section 3.5, is in four-dimensions (d=4)

absence of the contact term (1.3) in the string result, which is replaced by the leading string

correction, given by the second line in (1.5). the string correction in (1.5) is indeed of the

same order of magnitude as (1.3) for   ms, however it has an explicit energy dependence
coming from the logarithmic terms.

6

in order to nd the appropriate interpretation of (1.5) in terms of eld-theory diagrams,

it is convenient to separate the integration region in (1.4) into two parts, by introducing

an arbitrary parameter l0 and writing

(1.7)

the g4

y m terms in a1 describe a box diagram with four light particles (of mass ) circulating

in the loop, while the g4

y m /m 4

s terms are the rst string corrections coming from box

diagrams with one massive particle (of mass ms) and three light particles of mass  in the

loop. it contains also the l0 dependent part of the box diagram with four light particles in

the loop. the 1/m 4

s l2

0 term in a2 can be written as 4/m 8

s and reproduces therefore the

eld theory computation (1.3) in the case d = 6. however, as expected, a similar term with

opposite sign appears in a1 and the l0 dependent terms cancel. in a2 the rst dots contain

l0 dependent terms which cancel with higher-order contributions in a1 and the second

dots denote higher-order contributions, while the o(s2/m 4

s ) term is l0 independent and is

actually the rst correction to the tree-level graviton exchange. we emphasize, however,

that the only physically meaningful amplitude is the full expression (1.5) and the leading

string correction is therefore the second line of (1.5), coming from box diagrams a1 with

one massive particle in the loop.

strictly speaking, the result described above is valid for the toroidal compactication

of the so(32) 10d type i string. for a general n = 1 supersymmetric 4d type i vacuum
the amplitude a has contributions from sectors with various numbers of supersymmetries

a = an =4 + an =2 + an =1 ,

(1.8)

where the n = 4 sector contains the six-dimensional compact kk summations, n = 2 sec-
tors contain two-dimensional compact kk summations and n = 1 sectors contain no kk
summations. from the tree-level (a2) viewpoint, the n = 2 sectors give logarithmic diver-
gences which correspond in the one-loop box (a1) picture to additional infrared divergences

associated to wave-functions or vertex corrections, which were absent (by nonrenormaliza-

tion theorems) for the n = 4 theory. similarly, n = 1 sectors give no kk divergences.
as the important (power-type) divergences come from the gravitational n = 4 sector, the
toroidally compactied type i superstring contains therefore the relevant information for

our purposes. moreover, even if we place ourselseves in the context of type i superstring,

the formalism we use can be easily adapted to a type ii string context and the associated

d-branes. this can be done by exchanging some of the neumann boundary conditions in

the compactied type i string with the appropriate dirichlet ones for the d-branes [10, 11].

8

the basic results and conclusions of our paper can be easily seen to be unchanged.

the second aim of our paper is to calculate the tree-level string amplitudes with two

and three gauge bosons and one winding graviton emission. for theories with low string

scale and (sub)millimeter dimensions, this type of processes is one of the best signals for

future accelerators and was computed in eld theory in [7]. a full string formula is needed,

however, for energies close to the string scale where string eects are important. we

start by computing the two gauge bosons  one winding (kk mode m after t-dualities)

graviton amplitude. the resulting expression has poles and zeroes for discrete values of

energies, to be explained in section 4. we then compute the technically more dicult and

phenomenologically more interesting amplitude for three gauge bosons and one massive

graviton. we study the deviations from the eld-theory result and show that they are of

order m4/(rms)4. the full amplitude has an interesting structure of poles and zeroes

and allows, as explained in section 4, to dene an o-shell form factor. by combining the

results of sections 3 and 4, the eective vertex of two gauge bosons (one of which can be

o-shell) of momenta p1, p2 and an o-shell graviton of momentum p (see figure 6) can be

written as

where for an on-shell graviton p2 is equal to the kk graviton mass p2 = m2/r2
.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we review the mass scales and coupling

constants in type i string compactied on torii. section 3 is devoted to the study of

the virtual gravitational exchange. as explained above, this amounts in a type i context

to a one-loop nonplanar cylinder diagram described in section 3.1. sections 3.2 and 3.3

give two dual eld-theoretical interpretations of the amplitude as one-loop box diagrams

with open modes circulating in the loop and tree-level (winding) gravitational exchange,

9

respectively. a representation of the amplitude suitable for the low-energy manifestly uv

convergent expansion is provided in section 3.4 and applied to the compactied type i

string in section 3.5, where the rst string corrections to the eld theory amplitude are

computed. in section 4 we consider the tree-level (disk) one-graviton emission amplitudes

with two gauge bosons in section 4.1 and three gauge bosons in section 4.2. finally,

appendix a contains denitions and some properties of jacobi theta functions, appendix

b calculations of 4d box diagrams and appendix c some details on the disk tree-level

amplitudes of section 4.2.

2 coupling constants

consider the type i superstring compactied to d = 10d dimensions on a torus t d with
(equal for simplicity) radii r. the d-dimensional planck mass and yang-mills coupling

constant are given in terms of the string scale ms and the string coupling constant gs by

m 8d

p =

rdm 8
s

g2
s

,

g2
y m =

rdm 6

gs

.

eliminating the radius r in the above two relations for d = 4 we get

 

m 2
p
m 2
s

=

1
gsg2

y m

,

(2.1)

(2.2)

which shows that the ratio mp /ms can be very large if the string coupling constant gs is

very small. the radius r can be determined in terms of ms and the string and yang-mills

coupling constants as

(rms)6 =

gs
g2
y m

=

1
g4

y m

.

(2.3)

so if the string scale is much lower than the four dimensional planck scale, that is   1,
then the radius r is very small compared to the string length rms  1.

the equivalent t-dual description is given by a type ii theory on t 6 with 32 d3-branes

and 64 orientifold planes. the radius of t  is given by rms = (rms)1, so it is very large

compared to the string length. the t-dual string coupling constant is given by

(2.4)

let e be the order of magnitude energy in a physical process. we shall mainly be interested
in the low energy regime where e/ms  1. moreover we shall suppose that 1  e/ms,
which is compatible with a low string scale. the low energy limit of type i superstrings
was considered by green, schwarz and brink [12] in the regime e/ms  1 with  xed,
which corresponds to the gravitational decoupling limit mp  . it was shown there that
this limit is given by the n = 4 super yang-mills nite theory in four-dimensions. in the
following, section 3.1, we look for the leading stringy and kk corrections to the four-point

amplitude described in the introduction for values of parameters mentioned above and by

keeping a nite value for mp .

3.1 one loop type i amplitudes

for the non planar cylinder with two vertex operators at each boundary, the corresponding

group theory factor g is

t = (p1 + p4)2,

u = (p1 + p3)2 ,

(3.4)

that verify s + t + u = 0.

(3.6)

the denitions and some useful properties of jacobi modular functions i(z,  ) are given

in appendix a. from (a.5) we get

g (z/(c + d), (a + b)/(c + d)) = g(z,  ) + ln|c + d| ,

(3.7)

where a, b, c and d are elements of an sl(2,z) matrix.

the green function on the cylinder is conveniently obtained from that of its covering

torus. let the torus with modular parameter  = 1 + i2 be parametrised by the complex

coordinate w with w = w + 1 = w +  and let w = x +  , x and  being two real 1-periodic

coordinates. then the cylinder is obtained by setting 1 = 0 and orbifolding with w =  w,
the two boundaries being at x = re(w) = 0, 1/2. the parameter 2 represents the length

of the circles at the boundaries.

in the amplitudes (3.5), the region of integration over

the positions w is given by i < i+1 whenever the two vertex operators are on the same

12

boundary, the value of 4 being xed to 1 and the coordinate x is xed for the cylinder at

0 or 1/2. it will be convenient to use the notations:

(3.7) gives

3.2 the one loop amplitude as a sum of box diagrams

(3.15)

in order to obtain a eld theory interpretation of this string diagram, it is convenient to

rst divide the region of integration over i into three disjoint regions with a given ordering

r1 : 1 < 2 < 3 < 1 , r2 : 1 < 3 < 2 < 1 , r3 : 3 < 1 < 2 < 1 ,

(3.16)

then we can write

note that in (3.23), the particles circulating in the loop are open string oscillators and kk

states.

for d  4 the box diagram with massless particles in the loop, which is the leading

contribution to the above amplitude, is ir divergent.

harmless and in order to obtain a nite intermediate result it suces to add a small mass

to the particles circulating in the loop. since pi i = 1, it can be seen from (3.24) that this

is equivalent to the replacement

(3.25)

15

where  is a small mass which, as usual, is replaced by the resolution over the energy of

nal particles in a given physical process3.

in practice, the expansion (3.23) is not very useful.

it does not correspond to an

expansion in powers of s/m 2

s and t/m 2

s and merely gives an interpretation of the non

planar amplitude as an innite sum of box diagrams. the low energy limit is naturally

given by the box diagram with massless particles circulating in the loop. however, this box

diagram is uv divergent for spacetime dimension d  8, whereas string theory is nite in
the uv. this shows that this expansion is not manifesly uv nite. in fact for d  8 the
series is divergent term by term. this is to be contrasted with the expansion of the similar

torus amplitude in heterotic and type ii strings, where the modular invariance provides

an explicit uv cuto [14]. furthermore, for d  8 , even though the diagrams are nite
in the uv, innitely many terms contribute to a given order in s/m 2
s . in section 3.4 we

show how it is possible to get a systematic low energy expansion of the amplitude, which is

also manifestly uv nite. before doing that, we will need however another interpretation

of the non planar diagram.

3.3 the nonplanar amplitude as exchange of closed string modes

in this subsection we shall discuss a representation which is the string generalisation of

the proper time parametrisation used in equation (1.2). in this representation we must

express the amplitude (3.13) as a function of l =  1

2

, with l the modulus of the cylinder.

the factor f6 due to the kaluza-klein modes is given by (3.14), while the functions , t

dened in (3.12) are given by

(3.26)

3another way of regularizing the ir divergence is to add a wilson line in the chan-paton sector.

(3.32)

for n  0. the eld theory result (1.1) is obtained by truncating in (3.31) the massive
string oscillators and taking the low energy limit in c0, which gives 1/2. we therefore keep

only the winding modes, t-dual to the kk states appearing in (1.1).

the integral in (3.31) is simply the proper time representation of a feynman propagator

with the mass

m2 = m 2

s [(n2

1 + . . . + n2

d)(rms)2 + 4n] .

(3.33)

this fact reects a familiar result: the one loop open string amplitude can be seen as a

tree diagram in the closed string channel [9] where the masses of the closed string particles

17

are given by (3.33), the integer 2n being the closed string oscillator level and n1, . . . , n6 the

winding numbers. note however that the expansions we performed and therefore a trunca-

tion for some value on n are valid for large l. similarly to the case of the representation of

the non planar amplitude as a sum of box diagrams, this representation is not manifestly

uv convergent. in fact the sum over the winding modes behaves as ld/2 for small l, so

that the integral diverges for d  2 and in particular in the present case d = 6 we obtain a
quartic divergence.

3.4 type i ultraviolet regularisation of 10d eld theory

in the two preceding sections we have given two representations of the non planar amplitude.

both of them were not manifestly uv convergent and did not allow a systematic (in s/m 2
s

and t/m 2

s ) low energy expansion. here we combine both of them in a new representation

which is free of these two drawbacks.

the two dual expressions (3.9) and (3.13) are typically of the form

i = z 

0

dx h(x)[g(x)] ,

(3.34)

and we are interested in the small  expansion of the amplitude. in the easiest case where

g is strictly positive and bounded from above, the expansion is given by expanding the

integrand, that is

i = z 

0

dx h + z 

0

dx h(x) ln (g(x)) + . . . .

(3.35)

a less trivial case is when g vanishes somewhere between 0 and  and possibly at the
boundaries, in which case one cannot perform an expansion of the above form. suppose

however that g can be put in the form g = g1(x)g2(x) where g2 is strictly positive and

bounded. then one can expand i as

i = z 

0

dx h[g1] + z 

0

dx h[g1] ln(g2) + . . . ,

(3.36)

which can be useful when g1 is much simpler than g.

18

now we come back to the string amplitude, which in the open string representation has

the form

a = z

m 2
s

i)e

(s13+t24)

i s/m 2

s j t/m 2

s ,

(3.37)

where both i and j are bounded and nonvanishing at 2 = . however at 2 = 0 they
vanish and furthermore it is not possible to factorise a nite number of vanishing terms. the

closed string representation of the amplitude has the same problem : it is possible to isolate

the dangerous piece at l =  but not at l = 0. in fact the closed string representation can
be put in the form

a = z 

0

dl els/2m 2

s z d3 [4 sin (21) sin (13)]s/m 2

s i s/m 2

s j t/m 2

s ,

(3.38)

where i and j are bounded and nonzero at  but not at l = 0. note that the problematic
region of each representation corresponds to the nice region of the other represention. this

suggests a solution which consists in using a mixed representation of the amplitude : choose

a nite nonvanishing l0 and write the 10d amplitude as

a =

(3.39)

now in each integral we can use the factorisation described above. note that even if the

full amplitude is independent on l0, each part of it clearly does depend. in fact l0 plays

the role of an uv cuto c for the closed string exchange and l1

0 plays the role of an uv

cuto o in the one loop box diagrams. the two cutos are given by

c =

msl0

, o = msql0

and are clearly inversely proportional to each other:

oc = m 2

s .

(3.40)

(3.41)

19

this mixed representation is thus manifestly uv convergent. the low energy expansion is

also manifestly nite term by term.

lets elaborate more on this 10d example and obtain the nite result for low energy

limit of the amplitude. consider rst the a1(l0) part

+ . . . (3.46)

if we neglect higher order terms. note that the leading term depends on l0 and becomes

innite in the l0   limit, which signals that the 10d yang-mills box digram is uv
divergent. the l0 dependence must of course cancel in the full amplitude. in order to check

it explicitly let us consider the second part of the amplitude

(3.47)

the s/m 2

vanishing contribution to the rst order in s/m 2

s . in fact

z d3 ln i = z d3 ln j = 0 ,

(3.48)

20

as can be easily veried upon expanding the logarithms in powers of e2i. so to the rst

order in s/m 2

s or, more generally, if we neglect string oscillator exchanges in a2, we can

replace the terms in the curly brackets by 1. the integral over  can then be performed

and gives

(3.49)

this result, due to the massless graviton tree-level exchange in 10d, presents a perfect

square structure which allows the identication of the tree-level (disk) form factor g between

two (on-shell) gauge bosons and one (o-shell) massless graviton of momentum squared s

to be

g(s) =

 (s/2m 2

(3.50)

the presence of poles (and also zeroes) in this form factor is interpreted as due to a tree-

level mixing between the massless graviton and open string singlets, present at odd mass

levels in the so(32) type i superstring. the result (3.50) will be rederived and generalized

for o-shell gauge bosons and compactied 4d theory in section 4.

to the rst order in s/m 2

s , (3.49) becomes 1/2 + s/m 2

s 2 ln 2 + . . .. when combined

with 4s/m 2

s , the rst order terms in a2 in s/m 2

s cancel and we are left with

(3.51)

where in identifying the graviton pole in the last equality we used the rst relation in (2.1)

for 10d (d=0). to order (sg2

s /m 12

s ) ln(s/m 2

s ), the amplitude is then given by

a = a(1)

1 (l0)(s, t) + a(1)

1 (l0)(u, t) + a(1)

1 (l0)(u, s) + a2(l0) .

(3.52)

notice rst of all that up to this order the terms dependent on l0 cancel in the sum

a1(l0) + a2(l0), as it should. the rst term in the r.h.s. of a2 represents the exchange of

the graviton multiplet between the two gauge bosons. one may be tempted to interpret a2

as the gravitational contribution to the amplitude. this is unambigous as long as we are

21

considering the leading contributions in a1 and a2. however, if we consider higher order

terms the distinction between a1 and a2 looses its relevance. in other words the gauge

and gravitational contributions are mixed and only their sum in meaningful. notice also

the absence of terms of order 0 in s/m 2

s in a. this is a direct verication of the absence of

one loop (trf 2)2 terms in the eective action of the type i superstring, a result which was

important in checking the type i/heterotic duality [15].

let us consider the eect of including higher order terms. the dominant contribution of

a1 is of order sg2

s/m 12

s . however this contribution is l0 dependent and thus must cancel

with a similar contribution from a2. the rst l0 independent contribution to a1 is of

order (g2

ss2/m 14

s ) ln(s/m 2

s ), which can be easily checked explicitly.

notice that in this way, one sees clearly how type i strings regularise the uv divergent

eld theory. in eld theory language, this is equivalent to introducing an arbitrary uv cuto

in the divergent (box) diagram and using a related cutto in the graviton exchange one.

the product of the two is m 2

s and the sum of the two diagrams is cuto-independent. one

may interpret the result as a regularisation of the yang-mills theory by gravity. notice that

this works in a subtle way because the gravity diagram here is uv nite. the regularisation

is possible because the cuto used on the gravitational side is inversely proportional to the

one used for the yang-mills diagram.

3.5 type i ultraviolet regularisation of winding modes in 4d

in 4d the box diagrams are uv convergent but the closed string exchange is uv divergent.

introducing the parameter l0 and using a mixed representation we get a manifestly uv

nite form of the amplitude. the ir divergence of the box diagram is eliminated by adding

a small mass  to the open string modes or, in a susy manner, by adding a wilson line

in the open sector.

tha amplitudes can be expanded in rms as well as in s/m 2

s and t/m 2

s . since we are

22

interested in the small rms limit we shall keep the leading contribution in rms and the

next to leading contribution in s/m 2

s . the leading contribution in (rms) in a1 is obtained

by neglecting all the kaluza-klein modes whose relative contributions are of order (rms)4.

in a2 the sum over the winding modes is replaced by the zero mode and an integral over

non-zero modes, that is

el[s/2m 2

s +(n2

6)(rms)2/2+2n] = els/2m 2

s (1 +

(3.53)

note that strictly speaking one should neglect the zero mode contribution, however this is

the only term that diverges in the s/m 2

as in the previous section, eq. (3.47), if we neglect string oscillator contributions coming

from i, j, the  integral gives an eective form factor (3.50), which is seen now to be the

same for all winding states, result which will be rederived and shown to be true even for

o-shell gauge bosons in section 4.

it is transparent in (3.58), because of the factor g4

y m , that the leading corrections to the

graviton exchange diagram are actually mostly related to the one-loop box diagram and

not to massive tree-level exchanges. however, as already emphasized, the real physical

quantity is the sum of a1 and a2.

we now turn to the a1(l0) contribution, where we rely heavily on technical results

derived in appendix b. the dominant contribution is obtained from

(3.63)

note that the second term when considering the sum a(1) + a(2) + a(3) gives a vanishing

contribution due to s + t + u = 0. the next contribution to a1 comes from box diagrams

with a massive string mode in one propagator, the other three propagators containing light

particles (of mass ). as before, since the diagrams are uv convergent, in order to get

the l0 independent terms it suces to calculate the corresponding box diagram. these

diagrams are calculated in appendix b. the l0 independent terms in the sum of the three

4 couplings of brane states to bulk states

another interesting computation, closely related to the tree-level exchange of virtual

closed string states is the tree-level (disk) coupling between two open (brane) states and one
closed (bulk) winding excitation of mass w2  n2r2m 4
here, in agreement with the results obtained in sections 3.4 and 3.5, that all winding modes

s , where n2 = n2

1 +    n2

6. we show

couple the same way to the gauge bosons with a form factor written in (3.50). recently

this issue was investigated in an eective theory context [16] and an exponential supression

in the winding (kk after t-duality) modes was found, interpreted there as the brane

thickness. in a eld theory context, the result depends not only on the fundamental mass

scale but also on other (dimensionless) parameters. the full result has a nonperturbative

origin from string theory viewpoint. in the perturbative string framework we discuss here,

the result depends only on the string scale ms. the form factor that we found in (3.50)

depends actually on the energy squared of the graviton and not on its mass, a dierence

which is important for o-shell calculations. moreover, its presence is actually, as discussed

25

in detail in previous sections, not directly related to the regularization of winding (kk)

virtual summations.

4.1 two gauge bosons - one winding graviton amplitude

we consider for illustration the case of the open bosonic string. a similar computation

in the superstring case was performed in [10] and we compare here their result with ours

in order to understand the role played by supersymmetry in these computations. we

compute the correlation function of two gauge boson vertex operators v i

i with one one

bulk graviton vertex operator v 34

3

on the disk represented here as the upper half complex

allow to x three parameters in the positions of the vertex operators. we choose to x

where n3 was determined by factorization of the one-loop four-point amplitude of section

n = 1   a positive integer, and zeroes for s = 2(n + 1)m 2

s . the poles can be interpreted

s , with

27

as due to massive open string states at odd levels coupled to the gauge elds and to the

massive graviton through a tree-level diagram, as in figure 6.

in order for this to be

possible, these states must be gauge singlets.

indeed, in the toroidal compactication

we are considering, the gauge group is orthogonal (so(213) for the bosonic string) and

the spectrum contains adjoint (antisymmetric) representations at even mass levels and

symmetric representations at odd mass levels. the symmetric representations however are

reducible and contain the singlets which produce the poles. note that, even if the spectrum

at odd mass levels starts with a tachyonic state, this does not couple and therefore produce

no pole in the amplitude. the particular case w2 = 0 of the amplitude is in agreement

with the eld-theoretical computation of the three-point amplitude computed from the

interaction lagrangian

l =

h tr (f f

ff  +   ) ,

(4.7)

where t  is the energy-momentum tensor of the gauge-elds and h represents the gravi-

ton. more precisely, an explicit 3-point computation from (4.7) reproduces exactly all

terms in (4.6) except the terms quartic in momenta. up to these terms actually the result

is exactly the same as in the superstring case4 [10] and therefore the conclusions we present

below are largely independent on supersymmetry5. in particular, we nd here again the

selection rule which make the amplitude vanish for s = 2(n + 1)m 2

s . the quartic terms,

absent in the superstring case, are to be interpreted as arising from the higher-derivative

term in the lagrangian f f r, with r the gravitational riemann tensor.

the computation presented is on-shell s = w2. we are now interested in the large

s=w2 behaviour of the above amplitude (for values which avoid the poles and zeros we just

discussed), which on-shell is equivalent of considering couplings to very massive winding

4this can be shown by using the identity 22z1(z)(z + 1/2) = (2z).
5this allowed us to determine the normalisation constant n3 in (4.3) by factorizing the one-loop am-

plitude of section 3.5.

s / ln 2. however, we emphasize again that this interpretation is valid for masses

not very close to poles and zeros of the full expression (4.6), where the interpretation is

completely dierent. in addition, as shown in (3.50), for o-shell gravitons the winding

mass w is actually replaced by the (squared) momentum of the graviton, k2.

4.2 three gauge bosons - one winding graviton amplitude

this (tree-level) amplitude is of direct interest for accelerator searches and was calculated at

the eective-eld theory level in [7]. it is however important to have a full string expression

in order to control the string corrections for energies close enough to the string scale ms.

29

moreover, this computation allows an o-shell continuation of the form factors (3.50), (4.9)

for one of the two gauge bosons.

the amplitude involves the correlation function of three gauge vertex operators of po-

larisations i and momenta pi (i = 1, 2, 3) and of a massive winding-type graviton of

polarisation 4 and momentum p4. the three conformal killing vectors allow us to x the

positions of the gauge vertex operators on the boundary of the disk y1 = 0, y2 = 1 and

y3 = . then the position of the graviton is unxed on the disk, represented as usual
as the upper half plane. some details about this computation in type i superstring are

displayed in the appendix c. we choose to use the 0-picture vertex operators for the gauge

bosons and the (-2) picture vertex on the disk (corresponding to the (-1,-1) picture on the

sphere) for the graviton vertex operator [17]. therefore we have

(4.11)

for the graviton, where  and  are the world-sheet fermions and the bosonised ghosts,

respectively. the amplitude of interest reads

(4.12)

where we introduced the normalization constant, to be xed by unitarity. by using the

mandelstam variables (3.4), the kinematics of the amplitude is summarized by the equations

s = 2p1.p2 = 2p3p4 + w2 , t = 2p2.p3 = 2p1.p4 + w2 ,
u = 2p1.p3 = 2p2.p4 + w2 , s + t + u = w2 .

turns out to be exactly the eld-theory amplitude [7]. the full string result

(4.15) obviously reduces to the eld theory result in the low energy s, t, u << m 2

s and low

s limit. the analytic structure of the string amplitude shows the

graviton mass w2 << m 2
presence of poles for s, t, u = (2n2)m 2
open modes exchanges in the s, t and u channel, respectively. moreover, we nd, like in
the previous section, poles for graviton winding masses w2 = (2n  1)m 2
a tree-level mixing between the graviton and the gauge singlets present at the odd open

s for n a positive integer, corresponding to tree-level

s , interpreted as

string levels, which couples afterwards to the gauge elds. we nd also interesting zeroes

of the amplitudes for very heavy gravitons w2 = s + 2nm 2

s or similar equations obtained
by the replacement s  t, u, giving interesting selection rules. by using (4.15) we are now
able to extend the form factor (3.50) to the case where one of the gauge bosons is o-shell

31

resonance is, in the s-channel, s = 2m 2

s and similarly for t and u, meaning that eld theory

computations certainly break down for energies above. for energies well below this value

s, t, u, w2 << m 2

s , it is easy to nd the corrections to the eld-theory computation by

performing a power-series expansion in (4.15). the rst corrections turn out to be of the

form

(4.19)

notice that the rst correction to the amplitude with a massless graviton (of xed energy)

is of order e6/m 6

s , so the deviation from the eld theoretical result is rst expected to be

seen from massive gravitons.

an experimentally more useful way to dene deviations from the eld theory result is

in the integrated cross-section , obtained by summing over all graviton masses, up to the

available energy e

(4.20)

(or m2 in (4.18)) ar absent in (4.20) and therefore at low energies the string corrections are

smaller than expected, of order

however, as mentioned above, strong deviations appear close to the value e2 = 2m 2

c the type i disk amplitude

write the vertex operators with the aid of grassmann variables i and i as

4v4(z) = z d4eip4.x(z)+iw.y (z)+44.(z) , 4v4(z)=z d 4eip4.x(z)iw.y (z)+ 44.(z) .

the correlation functions are then easily calculated with the aid of

< (z1)(z2) > =

z1  z2

< c(y1)c(y2)c(y3) > = (y1  y2)(y1  y3)(y2  y3) , < e(z)e(z) >=

then we x the positions yi to 0, 1 and  and calculate the integral over the grassmann
variables. the resulting amplitude involve integrals of the form

(c.5)

for pedagogical reasons, we present here also a similar but much simpler computation in

the bosonic string, the four-point function of three open string tachyons and one winding

state closed string tachyon. the vertex operators vi for open tachyons and v4 for the

winding state closed tachyon in this case are

vi = g1/2

s ai : e2pix(yi) : ,

37

v4 = gs : eip3x(z)+iwy (z) :: eip3x(z)iwy (z) :

.

(c.6)

by using unitarity arguments as in section 4 in order to x the overall normalization

constant, the amplitude to compute becomes therefore

a =

where the complex integral is in the upper half complex plane. the kinematics of the

process is described by

1 = p2

2 = p2

3 = m 2

s , p2

4 + w2 = 4m 2

s = m 2

s  w2 + 2(p1 + p2)p4 , t = 5m 2

s + w2  2p2p4 ,

u = 5m 2

s + w2  2p1p4 , s + t + u = 5m 2

s + w2 .

the simplest way to compute the amplitude is to use equalities of the type
