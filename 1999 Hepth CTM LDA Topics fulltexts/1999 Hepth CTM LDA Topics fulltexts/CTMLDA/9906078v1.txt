abstract

we realize the two dimensional anti-de sitter (ads2) space as a s1 com-

pactication of the ads3 space in the framework of dlcq (discrete light

cone quantization). this realization of the ads2 space illustrates how the

ads2/cf t duality can be derived from the well-known ads3/cf t duality.

we also evaluate the entropy for the ads2 black hole comparing it with ads3

black hole.

one of the main progresses achieved recently in the string theory is the ads/cf t duality

[1,2], which connects the gravity in the d-dimensional anti-de sitter (adsd) space and the

(d  1) dimensional conformal eld theory (cf t ) on its boundary. among the ads/cf t
dualities in the various dimensions are the ads3/cf t and ads2/cf t dualities relevant

for the black hole physics, since most of the black holes in the string theories are known to

contain either ads3 space or ads2 space in their near horizon geometries [1,3]. thus, the

ads/cf t dualities in low dimensions would play a key role in understanding the quantum

aspects of the black holes.

since the boundary theory of the ads3/cf t is given in terms of the conventional two

dimensional conformal eld theory, it has been possible to discuss explicitly various aspects

of the ads3/2d  cf t duality [4,5,7]. in particular, the ads3/cf t has been helpful to
improve our understanding on the three dimensional black hole, i.e. btz black hole [6].

however, compared with the case of the ads3/cf t duality the ads2/cf t duality is less

well discussed in the literature. observing that the near horizon geometry of the three

dimensional btz black hole becomes eectively ads2 in the low energy regime, one may

attempt to derive the ads2/cf t duality from the known ads3/cf t . this approach was

taken by strominger in his recent work on ads2/cf t duality [8].

here in this paper we will employ a dierent strategy to derive the ads2/cf t dual-

ity, namely the dlcq (discrete light cone quantization) [9], which reveals the ads2/cf t

duality more transparently. if the btz black hole is viewed in the light cone frame, the

metric components in the light like directions are constant and can be scaled by boosting

the frame. thus, if the light cone coordinate, x is taken to be periodic, the kaluza-klein

compactication can be easily performed by boosting the frame with a large amount. in or-

der to have periodic light cone coordinate, we employ the dlcq procedure, which has been

discussed recently [10] in the context of the matrix m-theory [11]. one of the advantage of

this approach is that we do not need to conne ourselves to the near horizon region.

this paper is organized as follows. we begin with a brief description of ads2 space as

the near horizon geometry of ads3 and the dlcq limit of ads3. then we elaborate on

2

the dlcq procedure, introducing the dlcq coordinates, which interpolates the original

(unboosted) coordinates and the light cone coordinates. with this dlcq coordinates we

discuss the deformation of the boundary conformal eld theory and show that ads2/cf t

correspondence can be deduced from the ads3/cf t . as an application we evaluate the en-

tropy of the ads2 black hole. the paper is concluded with a brief remarks on the ads2/cf t

correspondence and its extension.

we begin with a brief review of the well-known classical d1-d5 black hole in ten dimen-

sions, which has its near horizon geometry as mbt z  s3  t 4

here we note that the btz black hole becomes bps object as we take the limit   
while keeping m, j nite; in this limit m  j/l  0.

it is tempting to reduce the three dimensional black hole to a two dimensional ads black

hole by the kaluza-klein reduction. the early attempt was made in ref. [12], where the four

3

dimensional reissner-nordstrom black hole is described as ads2  s2. rewriting the btz
black hole metric eq.(3) as

(gbt z)m n = 


g + e2daa

we may read the two dimensional metric g, ,  = ,  and the u(1) gauge eld

(7)

thus, the btz black hole may be viewed as a two dimensional ads black hole with a u(1)

charge. however, since the radius of the compact s1, e2d becomes large as we approach to

the asymptotic region, it is not appropriate for our purpose.

a more suitable description of ads2 is given by strominger in his recent work [8], by

taking the very near horizon limit of the extremal black hole. if we take an extremal limit

u0  0,   , keeping u0e nite, the btz black hole becomes a bps object

in this paper we will discuss the ads2/cf t explicitly by applying the dlcq procedure

to the btz black hole, which reveals the relationship between the ads3/cf t duality and

the ads2/cf t duality more transparently. the metric of the btz black hole in the light

cone frame becomes

where x = (x5  t)/2. it suggests that the light cone coordinate, x may be chosen to be

compactied, since the dilaton is constant. here we need to employ the dlcq procedure

in order to have a periodic light like coordinate. the dlcq procedure has been recently

discussed [10] in the context of the matrix m-theory [11]. so some part of the analysis to

be presented here also will be useful to study the matrix m-theory. let us suppose that x5

is periodic, x5  x5 + 2rs, i.e., (x+, x)  (x+ +2rs, x +2rs). then by a lorentz

boost, we have

(x+, x)  (x+ + 2rse, x + 2rse),

rs
r

(11)

where x = ex are the boosted light cone coordinates. in the limit of the large boosting,
i.e. when the boosting parameter   , (equivalently rs  0 with r kept nite), x
becomes periodic;

(x+, x)  (x+, x + 2r).

(12)

now let us take the lorentz boost. it should be noted that the boost with a large amount

also yields the kaluza-klein compactication. in the boosted coordinates,

here we note that the dilaton factor, i.e., the compactication radius is constant. in the
innite dlcq limit, the geometry becomes m2  s1. here m2 may be identied as ads2
black hole. indeed redening the coordinates,

in ref. [5], one of the authors explicitly showed that the boundary conformal eld theory

is given by a sl(2, r) sl(2, r) wzw model, which is equivalent to the three dimensional
gravity on ads3, resorting to the faddeev-shatashvili procedure. since ads2 space is ob-

tained by the kaluza-klein reduction from ads3, the dimensional reduction leads us to the

boundary conformal theory corresponding to the ads2 space. in the three dimensions the

gravity can be described by a non-abelian chern-simons gauge theory [14,15] and in the

presence of a cosmological constant the action is given by the non-abelian chern-simons

gauge theory with sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) as its gauge group

as we have seen, the dlcq procedure results in the kaluza-klein reduction along the

light like direction. here we discuss the dimensional reduction of the chern-simons action

for the gravity, which is concurrent with the dlcq procedure. to be precise, we introduce a

6

new coordinates (t, u, x) (hereafter called dlcq coordinates) interpolating the original coor-

dinates (t, u, x5) (when  = 0) and the innitely boosted light cone coordinates (x+, u, x)

(when   ): (t, x)  (t, x + 2rscosh 2). in the boosted frame we identify the

periodic coordinate as

x =

e2x+ + e2x
e2 + e2

=

ex+ + ex
e2 + e2

.

the time coordinate is chosen such that t is orthogonal to x

t =

x+  x

=

ex+  ex

(19)

(20)

in the innite boosting limit (  ), t  x+ = ex+ and x  x = ex. in this
dlcq coordinates, the metric reads as

it depicts an ads2 black hole with u(1) charge and coincides with the metric eq.(13)

(23)

thus, the ads2 black hole can be described in terms of the extremal ads3 black hole in the

framework of dlcq. in passing we note that the dlcq procedure results in the extremal

limit yet in a way dierent from the usual one described before eq.(8);   , and
rs  0 so that r e = rscosh 2 e+ is kept nite.

the dlcq coordinates are more useful when we discuss the boundary conformal eld

theory. we rst give the dlcq reduction of the bulk chern-simons action. we may rewrite

the action as

among those, only the components ax and ax are physically important because the nontriv-

ial geometrical structure of the three dimensional space is completely encoded by holonomies

or wilson loops of the chern-simons gauge elds [16],

w [c] = p exp(cid:18)ic

axdx(cid:19) ,

w [c] = p exp(cid:18)ic

axdx(cid:19) ,

(29)

where c is a closed curve and p denotes a path ordered product. since in the limit where

(30)

we see that the the right sl(2, r) sector becomes trivial while the left sl(2, r) sector

remains relevant. it is consistent with the observation that the dlcq and scaling procedure

results in the bps limit. this also explains how the isometry group of ads3, sl(2, r) 
sl(2, r) reduces to the isometry group of ads2, sl(2, r) in the framework of dlcq.

as is discussed in ref. [5], if the chern-simons action is dened on the space with a bound-

ary, a suitable boundary term should be supplemented in accord with the given boundary
condition. we may choose the boundary conditions as (at + a5) = 0, ( at  a5) = 0. it
follows that the boundary term is determined as

ib = 

k

4 zm

tr(at + a5)a5 +

k

4 zm

tr( at  a5) a5.

(31)

then we get the action for the boundary conformal degrees of freedom by applying the

faddeev-shatashvili procedure [17],

g =

where g + g = ics(ag, ag) + ib(ag, ag)  ics(a, a)  ib(a, a).

now we are ready to take the dlcq procedure for the action. in the dlcq coordinates

r (e2t, x) we may identify i as the left sector of the action
where i, j  (u, x). with (, ) = 1
for the btz black hole given in ref. [5]. we also nd that i can be understood as the right

sector of the action for the btz black hole in terms of ( , ) = 1

r(e2t, x). the right sector

is conned in the extreme low energy regime, thus, suppressed. the left sl(2, r) sector

only becomes relevant to the ads2.

the dlcq procedure presented here describe explicitly how ads2/cf t correspondence

can be reduced from the ads3/cf t . it would be interesting to explore its consequences in

various contexts. one may nd an application of the dlcq procedure readily in evaluation

of the entropy for the ads2 black hole. to evaluate the entropy, we adopt the result of ref.

10

[5], where the entropy of the three dimensional btz black hole is evaluated in accord with

the proposal of strominger [18]. comparing the boundary action for the ads2 (34) with

that for the btz black hole, given in ref. [5], we nd that the the expectation values of the

virasoro generators l0 and l0 for the ads2 black hole are given by

nl =< l0 >=

ku0

2r2e2
2l4

, nr =< l0 >=

ku0

2r2e2
2l4

e4.

(35)

here we assume that nl = nr = 0 for an appropriately chosen vacuum state of the black

hole. then it follows from the cardy formula that the entropy for the ads2 black hole is

evaluated as

s = 2r cnl

6

+ 2r cnr

6

= 2k

ru0e

l2

+ 2k

ru0e

l2

e2.

(36)

as   , the right sector does not contributes to the entropy, s  4kgm . however,

it may contribute to the entropy at quantum level through loop corrections. (some diculty

in evaluating the entropy by applying the cardy formula to the boundary conformal theory

was pointed out by carlip [19]. this diculty may be resolved if we consider the space-

time virasoro algebra, regarding the boundary conformal theory as the worldsheet action

for the string on ads3 [7]. it would be worth while to extend the work of ref. [5] along this

direction.)

we conclude this paper with a few brief remarks. we show that the ads2 black hole can

be described as a dlcq limit of the ads3 black hole. the boundary theory for ads2 is found

to be a sl(2, r) wzw model dened on the light like coordinate. if we are concerned with

the gravity on ads2, the zero mode sector of the ads3 suces in the framework of dlcq.

in accordance with it, the zero mode sector of the wzw model given by the action eq.(34)

denes the boundary theory, hence a sl(2, r) quantum mechanics. the correspondence

between the gravity on ads2 and the sl(2, r) boundary conformal quantum mechanics

will be discussed in detail elsewhere. we note that the entropy of the ads2 black hole

evaluated as eq.(36) is the same as that of the ads3 black hole in the original frame. thus,

the entropy is preserved by the dlcq procedure.

11

the present paper may be extended along various directions. one of the direction would

be the dlcq reduction of the string on ads3 [7].

it would be interesting to see if the

dlcq reduction leads us to a point source on ads2 and the entropy of ads2 black hole

can be given by the quantum mechanics. this may clarify some subtle issues associated

with the entropy of black holes in ads3 and ads2. the two dimensional black hole has

been one of the important subjects in string theory and gravity. it would be also worth

while to study the two dimensional black holes in the framework given in the present paper.

this may enable us to discuss the various aspects of the two dimensional black holes [20,21]

from the viewpoint of the three dimensional black hole. the most important application of

the present work may be found in the matrix m-theory. dlcq reduction of the m-brane

congurations may shed some light on the matrix m-theory.
