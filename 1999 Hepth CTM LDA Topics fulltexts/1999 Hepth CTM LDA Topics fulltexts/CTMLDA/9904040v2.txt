abstract

we construct string target spacetimes with ads3  x geometry,
which have an n = 2 spacetime superconformal algebra. x is found
to be a u (1) bration over a manifold which is a target for an n = 2
worldsheet conformal eld theory. we emphasize theories with free
eld realizations where in principle it is possible to compute the full
one-particle string spectrum.

1 introduction

the ads/cft correspondence[1] relates string theories and m-theory solu-
tions with an ads factor to the infrared conformal eld theory living on the
brane system. this was further elaborated upon in refs.
[2, 3] where it
was explained how one calculates the spectrum and correlation functions of
the conformal eld theory within a supergravity description. tests of the
conjecture involve comparing the supergravity correlation functions and di-
mensions of operators with the ones associated to the low energy dynamics
of the brane.

in order to construct tests that probe beyond bps states and the large
g2n limit, it is necessary to understand the full spectrum of excitations in
these backgrounds. the rst example1 was discussed in [5] where a weak
coupling regime exists at nite n (see also [6, 7]). further examples have
appeared in refs. [8, 9]. in general, in order to probe physics where super-
symmetry is less restrictive but still a powerful tool, we want to develop a
large collection of spacetimes that are good string backgrounds and that can
be understood in a simple fashion. it is the purpose of this paper to give
a large class of backgrounds for which this program is possible in principle.
our construction gives rise to spaces with n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry,
and they are derived from a worldsheet n = 2 superconformal eld theory.
after we completed this paper, we learned of the results of ref. [10] which

overlaps some of our results.

2 ads3 backgrounds

we wish to discuss general nsns backgrounds of type ii superstrings which
lead to spacetime supersymmetry on ads3. we will require that a large ra-
dius limit of the geometry exists, such that a semiclassical analysis can be
made valid; this is done in order to be able to compare with low energy
supergravity. we will restrict ourselves to coset conformal eld theories, for
which the semiclassical limit corresponds to taking all levels of the corre-
sponding algebras to innity simultaneously. moreover, we will be interested
in theories with n = 2 worldsheet superconformal invariance, which will
leads naturally to spacetime supersymmetry.

1for earlier work, see refs. [4].

these two requirements lead to the following constraints. the spacetime
is of the form ads3x, with x a seven-dimensional manifold/orbifold. n=2
worldsheet supersymmetry is obtained if x is chosen to be a circle bundle
over a complex manifold, which itself is a product of hermitian symmet-
ric spaces constructed as in kazama-suzuki[11]. (a possible generalization
would be to take more general complex manifolds x/u(1) with constant
positive curvature, but this is less well understood.)

this bundle structure allows for a decomposition of the energy momentum
tensor in terms of a u(1) cft and a hermitian symmetric space coset. this
u(1) pairs with the cartan of the sl(2) current algebra into an n = 2 free
system, and the remaining sl(2, ri)/u(1) is also a hermitian symmetric non-
compact coset. this splitting of the u(1) piece of x is required if we want
to bosonize the fermions in the sl(2, ri) current algebra.

in total, we have a system with n = 2 worldsheet supersymmetry,

(sl(2, ri)/u(1))  (x/u(1))  u(1)2

(1)

this construction possesses a natural gso projection (preserving the n =
2 structure) which leads to spacetime supersymmetry. of course, there are
other possible gso projections, such as that used in the construction of the
ns vacua of the n = 4 geometries considered in [5, 8, 9]. each of these gso
projections will be considered below.

the collection of models constructed in this fashion is a nite family of
spaces, and they should be interpreted as conifolds where a set of d1-d5
branes is localized.

a table with a list of compact cosets of dimension d  7 is provided here,
where we include the central charge of the model in terms of the levels of the
dierent groups that form the coset. other spaces like su(3)/u(1)2 can be
constructed as su(3)/(su(2)  u(1))  su(2)/u(1), so we dont list them.
our objective in the next section will be to give a detailed construction of
spacetime supersymmetry in these backgrounds, and to show why the stan-
dard choice of using the n = 2 u(1)r worldsheet current is not appropriate.
we begin by dening our conventions. in general, we will have an sl(2, ri)k
superconformal current algebra (j a, a), realized by free elds. there is a
free u(1) system, with currents (k, ). finally, there is a coset x/u(1)
with an n = 2 u(1)r current which we will denote by jc. we require the
total central charge ct = 15 such that it may be coupled to the standard
superconformal ghost system to dene a consistent string theory.

the total u(1)r current may then be written as

j 0 + jc(cid:19) = ih1 + ih2

(2)

we have bosonized the currents in parenthesis in favor of two bosons2 h1, h2.
this is the canonical choice for generic x, where we require the bosons to
be integral.3

it is straightforward to verify that the following opes are regular

jr(z)j 0(z)  0
jr(z)k(z)  0

these cases, spacetime supersymmetry will be enhanced.

where k is the level of the sl(2) current algebra and k is related to the radius
of compactication of the free boson leading to the u(1) supercurrent. in
deriving (5), we have used c = 15 (and thus c(x/u(1)) = 9  6/k).

the canonical choice for spacetime supercharges is

q = i dz eih1/2ih2/2e/2

(8)

where  is the superconformal ghost. these supercharges have the property
that they are brst invariant, while mutual locality requires that we keep
only q+. modulo picture changing[12], we nd the commutator

{q++, q+} = j 0  k

(9)

thus, (8) leads naturally to spacetime supersymmetry, but unfortunately, the
expected spacetime bosonic symmetries (such as sl(2)) are not recovered.
(problems of this nature were discussed in [5]; there the problems were much
worse, as the algebra was doubled, etc.) well consider this in more detail
below, and give the correct construction.

3 target space consistency

if x/u(1) is a direct product  iai, where each factor has central charge
ci = bi  ai/ki, then the condition c = 15 forces the constraint

6
k

ai
ki

= xi

(10)

which relates the level of the sl(2) algebra to the level of the other cosets in
the construction, and it is easy to see that taking ki   for all i forces k 
. this means that we have a good geometric picture of the coset as a target
space, since in the large ki limit the cosets behave semiclassically. in writing
(10), we have assumed that x has classical dimension seven. changing this
would modify (10) by terms of order one, so the ads spacetime would never
become semiclassical.

now let us analyse the spacetime isometries. we would like to see that the
isometries have appropriate commutators with the spacetime supercharges.
in particular, given the worldsheet sl(2) currents, we can construct charges
that should generate spacetime symmetries; consider the spacetime sl(2)

raising operator j + = h j +dz. this operator has the following ope with

jr,

j +jr(z)  + + 20+ 

j +

(11)

k

and the last term implies that the ope j +q++ is non-local.4 also, the qs
do not carry u(1)r charges, which is in conict with the spacetime n = 2

algebra if we want to identifyh k as the u(1)r current. that is, the existence

of the operator q++ leads to the wrong target space symmetries.

instead of doing this, we will modify the supersymmetry generator in

order that the spacetime virasoro algebra is recovered.

it is simple to see that the problem comes from the factor of j 0/2k in the
u(1)r current of sl(2, ri)/u(1). to solve the problem then, it is sucient to
redene the worldsheet u(1)r current

jr = jr +

1
2k

j 0 = ih1 + i h2

(12)

however, the ope jr(z) jr(z)  (5  1

++ = exp(+

(13)

has the wrong (6= 5/8) conformal dimension. this means we need to correct
again jr. that is, we dene

r = jr +
j 

f
2k

(14)

with f a current such that f (z)f (z) = j 0(z)j 0(z) and that is orthogonal
to j0, so that the bosonization of j  leads to the correct conformal weight
for the spin operator. we have a canonical choice for f in our models, as we
have the extra free u(1), k.

hence, if k has the same level as sl(2) , then

j 
r = jr +

j 0 + k

2k

(15)

will lead to the correct conformal weight for the spin operator. notice that the
current j 0+k is null, and orthogonal to jr, so that the natural spin operators

4to see this, it is useful to realize q  er jr.

constructed from j 
r have automatically the correct conformal dimension.
this also gives a charge to the spin operators under the spacetime u(1)r

generated by h k.

the full current is a sum of three integral pieces now

r = (0) + (+) + (

(16)

let us check that we get the n = 2 superconformal algebra in spacetime.

the brst invariant spin operators will be given by

s = exp(i

ih 
i
2

) exp(/2)

(17)

with i = 1. mutual locality and brs invariance lead to the constraint

(19)

the spacetime supersymmetry algebra (modulo picture changing) is now seen
to be given by

{q++, q+} = j +
{q+, q} = j 
{q+, q} = j 0 + k
{q+, q++} = j 0  k

(20)
(21)
(22)
(23)

which is exactly the ns sector of two dimensional n = 2 supersymmetry.
that is, this provides a general construction of n = 2 spacetime supersym-
metry whenever we have n = 2 worldsheet supersymmetry. motions in the
u(1) ber are the generators of the r symmetry spacetime current, and the
modications we made give charge to the supersymmetry generators, which
is a requirement of the algebra.

we want to complete the construction with the rest of the virasoro alge-
bra in spacetime. that is, we can write the rest of the modes of the spacetime
supercurrent by applying the other virasoro generators to the spin elds [5].

6

it is a straightforward exercise to show that the algebra closes with a
central charge given by cst = kp, where p is the winding number of the
strings located at innity.

it is also clear that the fact that the level of the u(1) is chosen to be
equal to that of the sl(2) current implies a quantization condition on the
radius of the u(1) bundle to be of the same order of magnitude as the radius
of the ads spacetime.

4 comments on ads3  s3  t 4 and ads3  s3 

s3  u (1)

now that we have a general recipe, we can go back and analyze previous
results [5, 9] in a new light. we conne ourselves to a few comments.

in particular, the current k is chosen in a very special way. for example,
in ads3  s3  t 4, we could have chosen either the cartan of su(2), or one
of the free u(1)s. since we have only analyzed the eects of the spacetime
raising operator j +, we can always guarantee that we get the spacetime vi-
rasoro algebra with either choice. on the other hand, if we want to keep the
full su(2) isometries of the target space, we actually have to also eliminate
a similar problem with the locality of the su(2) raising operator, and the
modication in the currents is such that both eects get cancelled simulta-
neously if we choose to pair the cartan element of su(2) with the one of
sl(2, ri), so the choice of null eld solves both problems at the same time.

for ads3  s3  s3  u(1), there is one linear combination which we
want to add to the cartan of sl(2, ri) such that all of the problems with the
isometries go away simultaneously. this choice is the diagonal u(1) which
cancels the terms from both ads3 terms, and a posteriori ends up having
the correct quantization condition. this chooses a complex structure on the
four free u(1) directions.

finally, let us remark on ads3  s3  cip2, where cip2 is understood
as the coset su(3)/(su(2)  u(1)). in this case, it can be seen that the
cartan of the su(2) coming from s3 can not cancel the non-locality of the
raising operator of su(2), so that we do not preserve the isometries, and
the correct quantization condition squashes the sphere, so it leaves us with
n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry as opposed to n = 4 which one may have
naively guessed.

5 vertex operators and free elds.

we have shown that it is straightforward to compute the spacetime ns sector
of supersymmetry. naturally, as we have a eld of conformal dimension zero,
represented by , we can multiply q by any fractional powers of . brst
invariance will choose a linear combination of q with the same spacetime
quantum numbers.

closure of the fermionic algebra on the bosonic generators provides that
  zz or   zz + 1/2, but not both simultaneously, as then the bosonic
generators will not be single valued when   e2i. that is, we have a
choice of two super selection sectors for the supersymmetry algebra. one is
to be taken as the neveu-schwarz sector as we already saw, and the other is
the ramond sector of the spacetime supersymmetry.

this is a feature of the free eld realization for the sl(2) current algebra,
and it actually lets us write vertex operators for the sl(2) current with free
elds. the same can be done with the coset constructions, as they admit
free eld realizations. now, we want to analyze the chiral gso projection.
this needs to be done for each case, as we are not using the n = 2 structure
of the worldsheet cft directly, but a modied version of it.

let us x some notation.
as is well known, coset conformal eld theories admit free eld realiza-
tions [13, 14]. for each of the raising operators of the algebra we use a b, c
system, with ope given by

b(z)c(z) =

1

z  z   =

1

z  z 

(24)

these can be super-bosonized into a set of two null (lightcone) scalars t, u
with ope

t (z)u(z) = log(z  z )
by taking b = adu exp(a1t ), c = exp(a1t ).

(25)

to the cartan elements we associate free supersymmetric bosons h. the

total collection of free bosons will be labeled by , and the fermions by .

for the bosons we want to take operators (in the left moving sector lets
say) which have an odd number of free fermion insertions in the [1] picture.

o(, , )eip

(26)

in this basis the embedding of the group theory (allowed lattice of values for
p) is not manifest.

8

this requirement corresponds to the chiral gso projection. the mass

shell condition

p  (p  ) + n =

1
2

(27)

may be equated to  j(j+1)
2k + m2 + 1/2, where j is the spacetime sl(2)
quantum number and m2 is to be understood as the ads3 mass of the state.
 is the curvature coupling of the free scalars. the gso projection implies
that we get a positive value for j; that is, the theory does not have tachyons.
the number of free superelds is ten, and the total eld with a worldsheet
curvature coupling of the ads and x theories combined together is a null
eld. in this sense, all theories have the same underlying structure. it is the
choice of lattice (modular invariant) which makes them dierent from one
another.

the ten dimensional massless vertex operators are the most interesting
as they predict the supergravity spectrum of the compactication. in this
case the polynomial s reduces to one free fermion operator. amongst these,
we will nd all the chiral operators of the spacetime conformal eld theory
which can be described by string vertex operators.

the fermion vertex operators are constructed by acting with the space-
time supersymmetry generators on the spacetime boson vertex operators that
we described. as we have a choice of super selection sector, they will look
dierent in each of the cases. it is also clear that this dierence is in the
powers of , and therefore the ope of two fermion vertex operators closes
on the ones of bosonic type.

the advantage of having a free eld realization is that we have a choice
of ten free fermions i, which can be bosonized into ve scalars, and writing
spin vertex operators is straightforward. one has to remember that in order
to get the right charges for the supersymmetries, they will be multiplied by
powers of eip with p2 = 0.

from the bosonization, we nd that each b, c system contributes two
lightcone scalars, i.e., their signature is (1, 1). hence the lattice that we
obtain has a signature of (n, m) with n + m = 10, and n, m  2. the
diculty in writing the partition function lies in nding the constraints on
the lattice and the screening operators of the system, so that at the end we
can recover unitarity and modular invariance.

6 discussion

we have given a complete construction of n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry
on ads3 spacetime for type ii ns ns backgrounds, which are constrained to
admit a version of n = 2 supersymmetry on the worldsheet. it is clear that as
we have exact conformal eld theories on the worldsheet, these are solutions
to all orders in  of the string equations of motion. moreover, usually
when we have enough spacetime supersymmetry, this is what we need to
guarantee that there are no non-perturbative corrections to the target space.
in principle, if we ask questions that can be answered perturbatively, this
approach should give a complete set of calculational tools.

on the other hand, further work is required.

in particular, the coset
model predictions certainly go beyond supergravity and compute the full
spectrum of the one-particle states of the string theory propagating on these
spacetimes, and therefore, we can get a good idea of what the spacetime
conformal eld theory might be, even when we are not required to be in
any large radius limit. this should shed light on the 1
n corrections to the
conformal eld theories.

the detailed form of the string partition function is not known, and it is
of course important to construct it and check modular invariance. this is not
clear, as we can not go to a lightcone gauge where everything is manifestly
unitary. also, as we have constructed these theories with free elds, it is likely
that everything is complicated by the screening charges, so that a very good
knowledge of how to extract the real physical degrees of freedom is required.
although some progress has been made in [15], it is far from complete.

spaces with non-compact cosets [16, 17] are also interesting, but their
spacetime cft description is bound to be complicated by the non compact-
ness, as the meaning of the conformal boundary comes into question, and
if we get a spacetime cft it seems naturally to give rise to a continous
spectrum of states which is certainly more dicult to analyze.
