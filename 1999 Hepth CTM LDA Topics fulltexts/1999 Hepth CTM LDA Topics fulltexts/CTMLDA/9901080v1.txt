abstract

studying dynamics of open strings attached to a d2-brane in a ns two form eld

background, we nd that these open strings act as dipoles of u (1) gauge eld of the

brane. this provides an string theoretic description of the ux modications needed

for the dbi action on noncommutative torus.

introduction

after the interesting work of a. connes, m. douglas and a. schwarz (cds) [1], noncom-

mutative geometry and especially the noncommutative torus is shown to play a crucial role

in the m-theory compactications [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. in [1], cds

conjectured that the super yang-mills (sym) formulated on a noncommutative torus de-

scribes the discrete light cone quantization of m-theory when we have a non-zero three form

background of 11 dimensional supergravity. in that paper, cds used the sym action with

an additional topological term proportional to the eld strength. this topological term in

the case of noncommutative compact spaces leads to some modication in bps spectrum,

necessitated by the u-duality.

since the eleven dimensional three-form is related to the nsns two form eld of string

theory, the cds conjecture means that the low energy dynamics of d0-branes or more gener-

ally any d-brane, in a b eld background is described by a gauge theory on noncommutative

torus, where , the deformation parameter of the torus is determined by the b eld back-

ground [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 15]. it was argued in [8] that, there should be an additional
term in the matrix model action proportional to x, the time derivative of the m(atrix)-
it is easy to show that this term can be
valued collective coordinates of d0-branes, x.

obtained from the topological term discussed earlier by cds, but as they mentioned, they

had no physical reasoning for adding this term. also there were argued that the coecient

of this term is proportional to the winding number of longitudinal membranes.

generalizing the ideas of [2], it was shown in [14] that the scattering amplitudes for

open strings attached to a d2-brane in the b eld background in the low energy limit,is

properly described by the sym dened on a noncommutative two torus with deformation

parameter identied with the background b eld. it was also discussed in [14] that higher
 corrections to the open string scattering amplitude, are given by the dbi action dened
on noncommutative torus.

in this paper, studying the open string dynamics, in a non-zero electric eld of the d2-

brane, we show that in the case of non-zero b-eld background these open strings act as an

electric dipole. hence in a non-vanishing electric eld one should modify the sym action, the

action describing the open strings dynamics at low energies, by adding a term proportional

to dipole moment of these open strings, which shows the interaction of these dipoles with

electric eld. we will argue that, in the noncommutative gauge theory, as argued by hofman

and verlinde [13], generalizing the usual t r of non-abelian gauge theory to t r, dened
by cds, the sl(3,z)sl(2,z) symmetry still remains and it automatically reproduces the

2

term, we nd it as dipole interactions in string theory. however if we do the quantization

procedure correctly [16], unlike the works of [1,8], there is no need to add an additional
term proportional to x to the m(atrix)-model action compactied on the noncommutative
torus. in this way we provide a more intuitive description of using noncommutative geometry

methods.

elaborating on this point we will show that, considering the dipole-background electric

interactions, assures the full u-duality group, from the string theoretic calculations, without

using the noncommutative geometry. from the m-theory point of view, the dipole moment

which are conserved quantities give the winding of longitudinal membrane [1,8]. this winding

number is a new degree of freedom should be added to the usual matrix model, when we

have a non-vanishing three form eld of the 11 dimensional supergravity.

open string dipoles

it was shown and discussed by witten [17], that the massless states of open strings attached

to a dp-brane, form a vector multiplet of a n = 1 d = 10 u(1) gauge theory dimensionally
reduced to (p+1). there, it was also discussed that the end point of any open string
attached to a d-brane carries the unit charge of that u(1) gauge theory. this point was

explicitly worked out by studying the bps excitation of the u(1) sym or dbi [18]. let us

consider an open string having its both ends on the same brane. since these open strings

are oriented, ends of them, from the gauge theory point of view, look like plus-minus unit

charges. so at the rst sight, it seems that they form an electric dipole and not a gauge

particle of that u(1) theory. this problem is easily resolved if we look at the open strings

more carefully. the bosonic part of the mode expansion of such vector states are:

x  = x + p + xn6=0

a
n

ein

n

cos n  = 0, ..., p.

(1)

since the vector state is described by b
1/2|v ac >, x (0,  ) and x (,  ) for such states
have the same value. hence the two end points, or the plus-minus charges, are really on

top of each other and there is no dipole moment, and these open strings simply give the

gauge multiplet of u(1) gauge theory. in order to discuss the same issue in the case with

non-zero b-eld, rst one should build the mode expansion of corresponding open strings.

here after for simplicity, we only consider a d2-brane with non-zero b-eld on it, however

unless it is mentioned explicitly by gauge theory here we mean sym or dbi where either of which are

gauge invariant.

 b

1/2 is the ns sector creation operator.

our discussion can easily be generalized to the case of other d-branes. the open strings

attached to such a d2-brane are described by [18]

hence the mode expansion of these open strings are [14]

x i = xi + (pi  bi




j x j = 0 i, j = 1, 2

, a = 3, ..., 9.

x 0 = 0

 x a = 0

(3)

where xi show an arbitrary point on d2-brane.

let us again study these open strings from the gauge theory point of view. in this case,

unlike the previous case (b = 0) the plus-minus charges locating at the end points of open

strings are not coincident any more, hence these open strings look like electric dipoles with
the moment p i:

p i = x i(0,  )  x i(,  ) = bi

jpj.

(4)

as we see the dipole moment is proportional to b eld and open string momenta, and is
always perpendicular to the momentum vector, pi.

as it is discussed by many people, the gauge theory governing the d-brane or open

strings dynamics in a non-zero b eld background, is not a usual dbi action but, it is the

dbi dened on a noncommutative torus. in the noncommutative case again we can talk

about the electric charges of the u(1) theory dened by the zero momentum sector of open

strings. in the b = 0 case (or more generally any rational b), since our theory enjoys the

(2+1) lorentz invariance, we can always make these dipoles to be zero.
in contrast, for
b 6= 0 our theory suers from the lack of lorentz symmetry [1, 12] then, especially when the
brane is compact, these dipoles can not be removed and they are the intuitive origin of the

noncommutativity of torus and the moyal bracket structure. form the gauge theory point of

view, these dipoles are really the gauge particles of the noncommutative gauge theory, where

they interact through the moyal bracket terms of the action. and one can also understand

the noncommutative sym, either by the open string dynamics [14], or by these dipole-dipole

interactions.

4

here we briey discuss some of the issues of the dipole description of noncommutative

gauge theory in (2+1) dimensions. a more extensive work will appear [19].

i) dipole moment conservation; since the dipole moment is proportional to the open

string momentum, the momentum conservation in each vertex will immediately result in the

dipole moment conservation.

ii) dipoles always move so that their dipole moment are normal to their momentum.

iii) because of moyal bracket structure, parallel dipoles are non-interacting.

iv) the high energy dipole-dipole scattering is suppressed by the moyal bracket structure.

interaction of dipoles with electric background

besides the dipole-dipole interactions, which are described by the moyal gauge theory, i.e.

the gauge theory dened on a noncommutative torus, there are dipole-electric background

them.

interactions, which are not present in the noncommutative gauge theory and we should add
in other words, to have a theory fully invariant under u-duality, the t r  t r
substitution should be done not only for free elds, but also for currents and uxes (or bps

charges) [13].

to work out the form of the dipole-background interactions, rst one should discuss the

explicit form of dipole moment. so let us consider a (d2-d0)-brane system, winding around

the two torus dened by

 =

r2
r1

ei

,

 = ir1r2 sin  + b.

(5)

along the calculations of [12], mode expansion of open strings attached to such a brane
system is given by eq. (3), where pi in the usual complex notation of the torus, is

p =

(r1 + q1 )(n + m)

|n + m|2

s 2

2

(6)

with r1, q1 being two arbitrary integers, (n,m) two integers that their greatest common
n gives the

divisor shows the winding number of d2-brane around the torus and their ratio, m
density of d0-branes distributed on the d2-brane. hence according to eq. (4):

p = ib

(r1 + q1 )(n + m)

|n + m|2

s 2

2

(7)

to include the dipole-background interactions, we should add the proper term to the gauge

theory action. since we nally want to nd the bps spectrum of the the (d2-d0)-brane

system, we use the dbi action:

s = s0 +z d3xp if0i = z lmod.dt,

5

(8)

where s0 is the usual dbi action:

s0 = 1

gs z d3xqdet(g + f ) = z l0dt.

(9)

here we have put ls = 1 but at last will reintroduce it. there could also be a wz term,

r c  f , since it does not alter our arguments much, we will not consider it at this stage,

but will come back to it in our nal results. to check the bps spectrum, we build the

hamiltonian:

with

h = f0i
|n+m|2

lsgs

f0i  lmod.
(1 + |0|2g2

s)1/2,

(10)

l0

, should be quantized as dual torus vector. hence

f0i  p.

(11)

the conjugate momenta of f0i, lmod.
f0i
comparing eq. (11) with the results of [12], every thing is the same except for the shift by
p in the conjugate momenta:

finally putting all of these together, we nd

r2, q2  r2 + r1, q2 + q1.

h =

1
lsgs

|n + m|2 (cid:18)1 + g2

s

1
2

|(r2 + r1) +  (q2 + q1)|2

|n + m|2

(cid:19)1/2

.

(12)

(13)

if we had also considered the wz term along the lines of [13], would end up with:

h =

1
lsgs

|n + m|2 (cid:18)1 + g2

s

1
2

(|

(r2 + r1) +  (q2 + q1)

|n + m|2

+ (c2 + c1 )|2)(cid:19)1/2

.

this spectrum as discussed in [13] has both sl(3,z) and sl(2, z)n symmetries. in order to
compare our results with those of matrix model [1,8], one should take the ls, gs  0 limit,
which again will give the results of [12], with:

r2, q2  r2  r1, q2  q1.

(14)

m-theory interpretations

as we see, considering the missing dipole-background interactions, modies conjugate mo-

mentum of the electric elds living on the two torus by adding a term proportional to open

strings momentum, eq. (4). in the m-theory side, the open strings momenta and m, number

6

of the d0-branes, are conserved charges related to cij components of 11 dimensional three-
form, where  = 0, .., 7 and i, j denoting the directions of t 3 m-theory compactied on. and

r2, q2, n (roughly speaking, the number of d2-branes), are related to gi components of met-
ric. more precisely (r1, q1, m) and (r2, q2, n) form two sl(3, z) vectors, and (r2, r1),(q2, q1),

(n, m) act as sl(2, z)n doublets. in terms of m2-branes these conserved charges are the
kk momenta and winding modes of m2-brane compactied on t 3. generalizing the ideas

of [21], to the non-zero cijk, we nd that the momenta should be modied by windings [1],
similar to what we have found here from the string theory arguments.

concluding remarks

in this work completing the results of [12,14], we provide a string theoretic justication
of the t r  t r substitution, when we have a nsns two-form background eld. it was
argued by hofman and verlinde [13] that a proper matrix model treatment of m-theory with

the three-form background is given by born-infeld on noncommutative torus. it was also
discussed [13] that, going from t 2 to t 2
 , one should modify the related uxes too. here we
studied the open strings attached to d2-brane with a non-zero b eld more carefully and in

this way provide an string theoretic description of the ux modication, and observed that

these open strings look like electric dipoles of u(1) gauge theory. considering these dipoles

sheds light on the noncommutative geometry methods and shows an explicit way to study

the renomalizability of noncommutative gauge theories [20].
