(3.8), see vector basis representation space associated possibly distinct ux ci = ic1 , c = aba1b1. geon state general superposition vectors, therefore ux geon state well dened states given representation. overcome problem advance claim total ux superselected quantity sense electric charge superselected. shall explain superselection occurs section 5. simply note consequence, physical states superpositions basis vectors total ux. assume this, spin-statistics connection holds physical states. start considering pair geons plane. algebra a(2) xed soon choose nite group h. section 2 saw exchange two geons realized operator r dened (2.26). similarly, 2 rotation one geons written c2 ii ii c2. would like know algebra a(2) implies kind relation exchange 2 rotations. let us start xing representation r = (, ) a(1). state vectors | i, jir hr given (3.8) well-dened spin, words, eigenstates c2. order establish spin-statistics relation need rst know eigenstates c2. recall c2 nite group. therefore exists least non-negative integer n c n 2 = 1 (4.1) eigenvalues c2 ei2s, spin = 0, 1/n, 2/n, ..., (n 1)/n. one see operator ps = 1 n n 1 xn=0 ein2s c n 2 (4.2) projects states spin s. front factor normalization constant ensure p 2 = ps, assume course n 2, non-trivial behavior 2-rotation. furthermore, state hr spin obtained linear combinations | s; iji given | s; i, ji = ps | ijir. (4.3) consider pair geons carrying representation r = (, ) spin s. addition, let us consider geons total ux ci = ic1 , c = aba1b1, i.e., assume geon state superposition basis vectors ux. following consequence. 19 (3.7) act | a, bi way ux c becomes conjugated i. words, ux vector basis {| i, jir} equal ci. hence ci becomes quantity characterizing particular superselection sector within r.we going show statistics system completely determined spin representation r. depend ci. precisely, r | | = ei(2sr) | | i, (4.4) states | | transform according represention r spin total ux ci. also, r angle depends representation r. usual spin-statistics connection true representations r r = 0. enough show (4.4) true states | | basis (4.3): | = ps | ijir = 1 n | = ps | klir = 1 n ci = ck. n 1 xn=0 xn=0 n 1 ein2s c n 2{ | a, bi | ji}, ein2s c n 2{ k | a, bi | li}, using (3.14) one show algebra r {ps | ijir ps | klir} =| ps | ijir. | = 1 n xn ein2s c n 2 1 ci { | ak, bki | li}. last formula, used notation | ak, bki := k | a, bi, (4.5) (4.6) (4.7) (4.8) ci, total ux | ai, bii, given ci = aibia1 product rst factor yet desirable form (a phase) | i. . result ( 4.6) tensor b1 let us take closer look | i. first let us dene ei = ci c2 write | | = ei2s 1 n xn proceed, show ein2s c n 2e 1 { k | a, bi | li}. eik = ke1, 20 (4.9) (4.10) (4.11) e1 = c c2 c = aba1b1. indeed, rst note eik|a, b >= cic2k|a, b >= cic2|ak, bk >= |ak, bk >= k|a, b >, (4.12) used fact ci = ck. therefore eik = k , (4.13) belongs stability group k(a,b) |a, b >. show fact = e1 := cc2. recall denition 1 = e.

(impure one-geon states probability distribution total uxes course permitted). consequence previous discussion two-geon system follows. one-geon system, superselection total ux means irrs r must split superselected subspaces, physical states belong subspaces. now, two-geon system state | | i, total ux must superselected, clustering property ensures geon must denite ux. therefore physical states, | | must separately superpositions states denite ux. conclusion two asumptions made check spin-statistics connections become natural include superselection total ux clustering property physical requirements theory. 6 geons quantum gravity section aim describe consequences results quantum canonical metric formalism gravity spacetime manifold gravity. form ir, may perform space versus time splitting dene classical conguration space q follows. let us specialize (2 + 1)d. let r() space riemannian metrics space manifold equal conical metric 23 neighborhood n innity1. quotient space group dif f () dieomorphisms spatial 2-manifold obtain q . therefore may denote q q = r() dif f () , (6.1) now, q simply-connected general, case one may many distinct quantizations, phenomenon seen example vacua qcd2. see resort so-called covering space quantization, briey review (for complete account, see ref. ). approach, wave functions (dening domains operators like hamiltonian) taken functions universal covering space q q certain specic properties. shown case q = r() dif f 0 () , (6.2) 0 () component connected identity, hence normal sub- dif f group, dif f (). follows always understood dieos , hence omit argument. well known universal covering x topological space x principal bundle x structure group 1(x), projection p : x x given covering map. structure group free right action : x x x quotient x/1(x) action x. action ber-preserving, i.e., every 1(x), x x p(x) = p(x). therefore q principal bundle q structure group 1(q), inferred (6.1) (6.2) isomorphic mapping class group m. wave functions need single-valued q q contains non-contractible loops. actually transformation wave function loops traversed gives representation 1(q). seen following way. must single- valued observables like . hand, since universal covering space denition simply-connected, functions always taken single-valued. therefore, could dene wave functions functions q still function q, would circumvent multi-valuedness wave functions leaving probability interpretation unharmed. task easily accomplished following way. let h complex vector space hermitian inner product h , carrying unitary representation 1(q) m. say function : q h equivariant every 1(q), q q (q) = (1)(q).
