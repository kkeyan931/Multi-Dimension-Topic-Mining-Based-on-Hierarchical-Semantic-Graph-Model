abstract

we consider a two dimensional su(n ) gauge theory coupled to an adjoint ma-
jorana fermion, which is known to be supersymmetric for a particular value of
fermion mass. we investigate the soft supersymmetry breaking of the discrete
light cone quantization (dlcq) of this theory. there are several dlcq formula-
tions of this theory currently in the literature and they naively appear to behave
dierently under soft supersymmetry breaking at nite resolution. we show that
all these formulations nevertheless yield identical bound state masses in the decom-
pactication limit of the light-like circle. moreover, we are able to show that the
supersymmetry-inspired version of dlcq (so called sdlcq) provides the best
rate of convergence of dlcq bound state masses towards the actual continuum
values, except possibly near or at the critical fermion mass. in this last case, we dis-
cuss improved extrapolation schemes that must supplement the dlcq algorithm
in order to obtain correct continuum bound state masses. interestingly, when we
truncate the fock space to two particles, the sdlcq prescription presented here
provides a scheme for improving the rate of convergence of the massive thooft
model. thus the supersymmetry-inspired sdlcq prescription is applicable to
theories without supersymmetry.

1 introduction

over the last several years we have learned a great deal about supersymmetric gauge

theories following the discovery of dualities between string/m-theory and supersymmet-

ric gauge theories [1, 2, 3]. recently this has been extended to conformal eld theories

without supersymmetry [4]. evidently, it would be desirable to have a deeper under-

standing of supersymmetry breaking in order to bridge the gap between the formulation

of physics in a supersymmetric world, and its more realistic counterpart, where no such

symmetry is manifest. one straightforward approach is to start with a supersymmetric

formulation, and then proceed to break supersymmetry softly by adding appropriate

mass terms.

the context within which we will consider this is a theory that has been well studied

before: two dimensional su(n) gauge theory coupled to an adjoint majorana fermion

[5]. interestingly, this theory is known to exhibit supersymmetry at a particular value of
the fermion mass, m = msu sy [7]. this is believed to be a theory with two parameters
g and m, both of which have the dimensions of mass. since the only g dependence is an
overall g2 factor in the hamiltonian the theory depends on one dimensionless parameter
x = m2
 , must be determined
in this work, we provide evidence that, while this
in terms of the one parameter x.

g2n and therefore all the bound state masses, in units of g2n

viewpoint is still correct, there is still scope for an additional operator (and associated

coupling constant) that may be introduced to improve convergence of the dlcq bound

state masses towards their actual continuum values. of course, these continuum masses

will be unaected by the presence of such an operator, but a judicious choice of coupling

will serve to improve the rate of convergence of our numerical results.

naively, when one adds a soft breaking term to the two dlcq formulations of the

theory, we appear to arrive at dierent spectra. the two formulations we are alluding to

are the principle value (pv) and supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization

(sdlcq), and are discussed in detail below. the question is whether these two spectra

are truly dierent or simply rescalings of the same spectrum which become identical in

the continuum limit. it would be very good news if they were in fact the same because

the pv prescription is generally accepted as correct ([9, 10]), while the sdlcq approach

is known to converge more rapidly in general.

actually, to understand the relation between these two schemes, it is helpful to present

a formulation that interpolates between the pv and sdlcq prescriptions by introducing

2

an additional operator [6] and associated coupling constant that we will call y .

in

particular, y = 0 will correspond to the pv prescription, while y = 1 will imply the

sdlcq prescription.

intermediate values for y will correspond to a mixture of the

two schemes. by diagonalizing the dlcq hamiltonian matrix, and extrapolating to

the continuum limit, we are able to solve for bound state masses and wave functions at

dierent values of the fermion mass parameter x and coupling constant y .

we shall show that the continuum bound state masses are independent of the coupling

y , as expected from a scheme independent prescription, although the rate of convergence

towards the actual continuum mass will be signicantly aected by our choice for y . in

fact, it will turn out that the value for y that arises naturally in the regularization

of supersymmetric theories (i.e. y = 1) provides the best convergence towards actual

continuum masses. thus, the supersymmetric formulation of dlcq (sdlcq), corre-

sponding to y = 1  rst highlighted in the work [11]  yields a method for improving

numerical convergence of dlcq bound state masses even for theories without supersym-

metry.

to show this, we study the dlcq bound state integral equations at high resolution,

which is made possible by truncating the fock space to two particles. in particular, we

show that the sdlcq approach converges more uniformly and rapidly for all values of

x that are suciently far from the critical value x = 0.

we remark that at the supersymmetric point x = 1, the sdlcq prescription pre-

serves supersymmetry even in the discretized theory. the advantages of such an approach

have been exploited in a study of a wide class of supersymmetric gauge theories in two

[12, 13, 14, 15, 6] and three dimensions [16].

2 formulations of the theories

in this section we will consider the formulations of 1 + 1 dimensional qcd coupled to

adjoint majorana fermions having arbitrary mass (see for example [5]) in the light cone
gauge a+ = 0. after eliminating non-physical degrees of freedom by solving constraint
equations, the lightcone components of total momentum are found to be:

p + = z dxt r(i),
p  = z dxt r

it can be checked that at m = msu sy the susy algebra {q, q} = 22p  is satised.
in the dlcq approximation the system lives in a x box of length l and one has to
sums over discrete variables k+ 6= 0 instead of integrations in the above formulas. for
periodic boundary conditions (bc), k+ = n/l where n = 1, 2, . . . , k and k is called
the resolution.

one formulation of dlcq which we will denote as the principal value (pv) prescrip-

tion [8], treats the singularities of the hamiltonian using a pv prescription and can be

4

formulated using either anti- periodic or periodic bc. the anti-periodic boundary condi-

tion must break the supersymmetry at nite resolution because the fermions and bosons

are in dierent fock sectors. the pv prescription with periodic bc could in principle

give supersymmetric results at nite resolution, although this is not the case. in the pv

prescription the supersymmetry at x = 1 is restored only in the decompactication limit
(k  ). this restoration was shown in [5] 1. the hamiltonian for this formulation
will be referred to as p 

p v .

the prescription that preserves supersymmetry at nite resolution will be called

sdlcq. in sdlcq one simply uses dlcq to calculate the supercharges and then uses

the super charges to calculate the hamiltonian and longitudinal momentum operator
[11]. here we must use periodic bc because the supercharge q is cubic in the elds,
while the supercharge q+ is quadratic.

the susy algebra is reproduced at a special value of fermion mass and at every

nite resolution the supercharge matrices give a representation of the super algebra.
both sdlcq and p 
p v at x = 1 give the same results as the resolution goes to innity
[13] 2. we now want to add identical soft susy breaking terms (mass terms) to these
theories and study the resulting non-supersymmetric theory. since we already have a
mass term in p 
p v this only requires varying x, but for sdlcq this means explicitly
adding a mass term.

it is very instructive to actually do the numerical calculation dierently and introduce
a third formulation, psu sy which includes both sdlcq and p 
p v . we have found the
operator which is the dierence between the sdlcq and the pv formulation [6] 3.
thus if we add this operator to the pv hamiltonian it is now supersymmetric at every

resolution and produces exactly the same mass and wave functions as sdlcq. in the

large n approximation the operator take the form.

numerically, this operator does not alter the actual continuum values observed in
su sy we included this
su sy as a single theory

the pv approach when x = 1. in our numerical formulation of p 
operator with an adjustable coupling y . we can now think of p 

1they nd that convergence is slower for period bc
2however sdlcq converges much faster
3to date we have only found this operator for this particularly simple theory but it should be possible
to nd it for other theories as well. the calculation of this operator involves a careful study of the
intermediate zero modes that contribute to the square of the supercharge

5

in the coupling constant space (x, y ). the formulation we called pv corresponds to

setting y = 0 and allowing x to be arbitrary, while the prescription we call sdlcq

corresponds to setting y = 1. in the following, we will present results for the lightest

bosonic bound states as a function of x and y . for a few values of x and y we will

truncate the fock space to allow only two particles fock states, which will permit us to

investigate the thooft equation for higher resolutions than would otherwise be possible.

3 soft susy breaking

our investigation of this theory indicates that at x = 1 ( the supersymmetric value of

the fermion mass) the lightest fermionic and bosonic bound states are degenerate with
continuum masses approximately m 2 = 26 [5, 13]. using p 
su sy we arrive at the same
conclusion for any value of y .

boorstein and kutasov [17] have investigated soft supersymmetry breaking for small
values of this dierence, x  1 and they found that the degeneracy between the fermion
and boson bound state masses is broken according to

m 2

f (x)  m 2

b(x) = (1  x)mb(1) + o((x  1)3).

(7)

they calculated these masses using the pv prescription (y = 0) with anti-periodic

bc and found very good agreement with the theoretical prediction. we have compared

this theoretical prediction at y = 1 and we nd that eq (7) is very well satised. at
resolution k = 5, for example, the slope is 4.76 and the predicted slope mb(1) is 4.76.
the indication is that this result is true for any value of y .

in fig. 1 we show the contour plots of the mass squared m 2 of the two lightest
bosonic bound states as a function of x and y at resolution k = 10. these contours

are lines of constant mass squared. selecting a particular value of the mass of the rst

bound state then xes a particular contour in fig. 1a as a contour of xed mass, which
we can write as y = yp(x).

interestingly, constructing the same contour plot for the next to lightest bosonic

bound state  see fig. 1b  yields contours that have approximately the same functional

dependence implied by fig. 1a. in fact, one obtains approximately the same contour plots

for the next twenty bound states (which is as far as we checked). the simple conclusion

is that the coupling y which represents the strength of the additional operator aects all

bound state masses more or less equally. this in turn suggests that at nite resolution,

y = y (x) for the mass squared of the second lowest bound state in units of g2n/ as a
function of x = m/g2n and y (b)

we can smoothly interpolate between dierent values of fermion mass x, and dierent

prescriptions specied by the coupling y , without aecting too much the actual numerical
spectrum. of course, in the decompactication limit k  , such a dependence on y
disappears, due to scheme independence.

since the lightest bosonic bound state is primarily a two particle state it is reasonable

to truncate the fock basis to two particle states. this will permit very high resolutions,

which will be needed to carefully scrutinize any possible discrepancies between the two

versions of soft symmetry breaking presented here. in fact, we are able to study the

theory for k up to 800. the mass of the lowest state as a function of the resolution for

various values of x and y are shown in fig. 2. each converging pair of lines  which

extrapolate the actual data points  in fig. 2 corresponds to dierent values of fermion

mass x. the top upper curve in each pair runs through data points that were calculated

via sdlcq (i.e. y = 1), while the lower corresponds to the pv (i.e. y = 0) prescription

commonly adopted in the literature. we nd that each pair of curves converge to the

same point at innite resolution, although this may not be completely obvious for the

lowest pair in the gure (corresponding to the critical mass x = 0).

away from x = 0, the sdlcq formulation is tted with a linear function of 1/k,
while the pv formulation is t with a polynomial of 1/k 2, where  is the solution of

7

1  x/2 = cot() [21]. it now appears that sdlcq not only provides more rapid
convergence for supersymmetric models, but also for the massive thooft model, which

is not supersymmetric. for the massless case, the situation is reversed; the sdlcq

formulation converges slower. it is t by a polynomial in 1/log(k) and gives the same

mass at innite resolution as the pv formulation. this behavior may be understood

from the observation that the wave function of this state does not vanish at x = 0. we

have looked closely at small masses, such as x = .1, and one nds that both pv and
sdlcq vary as a polynomial in 1/k 2 at large resolution. thus careful extrapolation
schemes must be adopted at small masses.

we therefore conclude that the continuum of regularization schemes that interpo-

late smoothly between the sdlcq and pv prescriptions  which we characterized by

the parameter y  yield the same continuum bound state masses, although the rate of

convergence of the dlcq spectrum may be altered signicantly. this implies that the

contour plots observed in fig. 1 eventually approach lines parallel to the y axis, and the

sole dependence on the parameter x is recovered.

4 discussion

the two dimensional gauge theory of adjoint majorana fermions has been studied exten-
sively [5, 7, 13, 17, 18] and is known to be a theory with an overall mass scale g2, and one

8

real coupling  the mass of the fermion  which we write as x in our notation. when one

adds a soft supersymmetry breaking term, the supersymmetric (sdlcq) and principle

value (pv) prescriptions for regulating the coulomb singularity appear to give dierent

bound state masses at nite resolution.

we observed at nite resolution that these dierent bound state masses may be

smoothly connected  in an approximate sense  by introducing a new operator, and

an associated coupling y , and then varying the couplings x and y along an appropri-

ately chosen contour.

by truncating the fock space to two particles, we were able to study the dlcq

bound state equations up to k = 800, which we summarized in fig. 2. we concluded

that after carefully extrapolating the data, the dierent prescriptions yielded identical

continuum bound state masses. moreover, we observed that the sdlcq prescription

improved convergence for suciently large values of fermion mass.

interestingly, since the two-body equation studied here for the adjoint fermion model

is simply the thooft equation with a rescaling of coupling constant, we have arrived at

an alternative prescription for regulating the coulomb singularity in the massive thooft

model that improves the rate of convergence towards the actual continuum mass. thus,

a prescription that arises naturally in the study of supersymmetric theories is also appli-

cable in the study of a theory without supersymmetry. we believe that this idea deserves

to be exploited further in a wider context of theories. in particular, it is an open question

whether this procedure could provide a sensible approach to regularizing softly broken

gauge theories with bosonic degrees of freedom, and in higher dimensions.

in any case, it appears that the special cancellations aorded by supersymmetry 

especially in the context of dlcq bound state calculations  might have scope beyond

the domain of supersymmetric eld theory. this would be a crucial rst step towards a

serious non-perturbative study of theories with broken supersymmetry.
