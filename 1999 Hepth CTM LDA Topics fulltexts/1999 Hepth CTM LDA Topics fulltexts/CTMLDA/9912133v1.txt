abstract

we give a unied analysis of four-dimensional elliptic models with n = 2 super-
symmetry and a simple gauge group, and their relation to m-theory. explicit calcu-
lations of the seiberg-witten curves and the resulting one-instanton prepotential are
presented. the remarkable regularities that emerge are emphasized. in addition, we
calculate the prepotential in the coulomb phase of the (asymptotically-free) sp(2n )
gauge theory with nf fundamental hypermultiplets of arbitrary mass.

introduction

the study of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories using the seiberg-witten (sw) ap-

proach [1] to the low energy eective action is now more than ve years old. during this period

the theory has undergone considerable development, from a variety of approaches. one of the

intriguing aspects of sw theory is the connection to integrable models, where m-theory [2]

provides one method of constructing the spectral curves of elliptic models. (another technique

is geometric engineering [3].) even though this aspect of elliptic models has been extensively

studied [4][7], there remain a number of open questions of some importance for these theories.

in particular, except in certain special cases, the bridge between the spectral curve of the elliptic

model and the corresponding curve obtained from an m-theory picture is still absent. this is one

of the issues we consider in this paper, with considerable progress, but not a complete resolution

of all the issues.

one motivation for understanding the connection between the spectral curve and m-theory

picture is to present the instanton expansion of the prepotential f for the theory in question.

as explained in our previous papers in this series [8][13], this will provide tests of m-theory by

means of comparison between our results for finstanton with the analogous instanton prepotential

obtained from the microscopic lagrangian5 [14][15].

the breakthrough of seiberg and witten [1] was their formulation of the exact solution

of 4-dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories in terms of a low-energy (wilsonian)

eective action accurate to two derivatives of the elds,

5 slater [15] has calculated f1inst for n = 2 su(n ) gauge theory with one symmetric hypermultiplet and nf

fundamental hypermultiplets using the microscopic lagrangian. his result is in agreement with the predictions

of refs. [9, 10] obtained using the m-theory curve of ref. [18]. this provides the rst independent check of the

predictions obtained using hyperelliptic perturbation theory [8].

where ai are n = 1 chiral superelds (i = 1 to rank g), f(a) is the holomorphic prepotential,

and w i is the gauge eld strength. the holomorphic prepotential can be expressed in terms of

a perturbative piece and an innite series of instanton contributions

f(a) = fclassical(a) + f1loop(a) +

l2dfdinst(a),

i(r) with  the quantum scale (wilson cuto), i(g) the dynkin in-

where l2 = i(g)pr

dex of the adjoint representation, and i(r) the dynkin index of a matter hypermultiplet in

representation r. the one-loop contribution is given by perturbation theory

(1.3)

where  ranges over the positive roots + of g, w runs over the weight vectors for a hypermul-

tiplet with mass mj in the representation rj, and ai parametrizes the cartan subalgebra of g.

for models with zero beta function, the instanton expansion is in powers of q rather than ,

where q = e2i with  the coupling constant of the theory.

in order to compute the prepotential (1.2) using the seiberg-witten approach, one requires:

(1) a suitable riemann surface or algebraic curve, appropriate to the gauge group and mat-

ter content of the theory, dependent on gauge invariant moduli ui (equivalently on the order

parameters ai) and the masses of the hypermultiplets.

(2) a preferred meromorphic 1-form , the sw dierential.

(3) a canonical basis of homology cycles (ak, bk) on the surface.

these data allow the computation of period integrals

2iad,k = ibk
from which one may compute f(a) by integrating ad,k = f (a)

in this paper we will discuss the sw theory for all simple classical groups g, with matter

hypermultiplets in the asymptotically free coulomb phase, or in the coulomb phase with zero

beta function. the discussion will be comprehensive in the sense that we will consider all generic

cases (i.e. of arbitrary rank g) for such models. the sw curves for these models fall into three

classes:

(a) hyperelliptic curves [16, 17],

(b) cubic (non-hyperelliptic) curves [18], and

(c) curves of innite order.

our focus in this paper will be primarily on the last class of curves which correspond to

decompactied elliptic models. the m-theory pictures for elliptic models for theories with

vanishing beta function were given by uranga [5]; those with simple classical groups are:

(1) su(n ) with two antisymmetric hypermultiplets and four fundamental hypermultiplets,

(2) su(n ) with an antisymmetric and a symmetric hypermultiplet,

(3) su(n ) with an adjoint hypermultiplet,

(4) so(n ) with an adjoint hypermultiplet,

(5) sp(2n ) with an adjoint hypermultiplet, and

(6) sp(2n ) with an antisymmetric hypermultiplet and four fundamental hypermultiplets.

we will explicitly write down the curves (leading-order terms only) for these models, and

the resulting one-instanton prepotential. by sending the masses of some of the fundamental

hypermultiplets to innity, we recover the curves for some additional models in the coulomb

phase which also possess curves of innite order.

a number of methods exist for extracting the instanton expansion from hyperelliptic curves,

with the method of asymptotic expansion [19][22] being the most useful for our purposes. in

refs. [8][12], we have extended these ideas to cases (b) and (c), developing methods for obtaining

the instanton expansion for non-hyperelliptic sw curves, of nite or innite order. in this body

3

of work, the order parameter ak emerges as the natural variable for describing the instanton

expansion, rather than the gauge invariant moduli. see ref. [13] for a review and more details.

in section 2, we discuss sp(2n ) gauge theory with nf fundamental hypermultiplets of ar-

bitrary masses, resolving some issues that were left open by previous work [20]. in section 3,

we assemble the results for the one-instanton prepotential for models with dierent groups and

matter content, observing a remarkable empirical regularity among the dierent cases. in sec-

tion 4, we summarize the m-theory pictures for the decompactied elliptic models, from which

we obtain the leading-order terms (dened in sec. 4) of the coecient functions of the sw curves,

using the geometry of ns 5-branes, d4-branes, and o6 orientifold planes. how to compute

subleading terms in elliptic models or their decompactication is one of the open problems of this

subject. using these leading-order curves, we compute the one-instanton prepotential for each

theory. in section 5, we show that the sw curve obtained by gukov and kapustin [6] for su(n )

with two antisymmetric hypermultiplets (with equal masses) and four fundamental hypermulti-

plets, and the curve obtained by uranga [5] for su(n ) with an antisymmetric and a symmetric

hypermultiplet (with equal masses), are equivalent, after a change of variables, to the curves for

those theories derived in this paper, giving dramatic conrmation of our methods. section 6 is

devoted to a consideration of su(n ) gauge theory with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet. we

explicitly exhibit the relation between the curve derived in this paper, the spectral curve derived

from the calogero-moser model by dhoker and phong [22], and the curve derived by donagi

and witten [4] in the context of the integrable hitchin system. we close with conclusions and

comments on open problems in section 7.

2. sp(2n ) + nf fundamentals

although this paper primarily concerns elliptic models, we include this section on sp(2n )

gauge theory with nf fundamental hypermultiplets for completeness, even though the sw curve

is hyperelliptic. there are some unresolved issues when all the hypermultiplets in the funda-

mental representation have non-zero masses [20], and we take the opportunity to clarify these,

particularly as the results are needed to complete our tables.

the sw curve for sp(2n ) gauge theory with nf < 2n +2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental

representation is [18, 20]

where l2 = 2n +2nf . writing the curve (2.1) as

y2 + 2 a y + b = 0,

the sw dierential is

(2.3)

2b(cid:17) x

because of the x  x symmetry, and since the genus of the curve (2.1) exceeds the rank of

the group (and hence the number of independent moduli), not all period integrals are relevant

for the sw problem.

the period integral is [20]

as the ak cycles are taken to surround the cut joining the two branch-points x

(2.4)

the periods and dual periods are computed by asymptotic expansion, as in refs. [19, 22].

(2.9)

equation (2.9) diers from the periods for su(n ) [19] in that for sp(2n ) sk(ak) does not

contribute to order l2 (1-instanton). it will contribute to order l4 (2-instanton), as is already

clear from eq. (2.6) and will be explicitly shown below. to one-instanton accuracy, the dual

periods are given by

(2.18)

this result is entered in table 2. a similar derivation applies to sp(2n ) + adjoint (the corre-

sponding curve is given in sec. 4.6), and to sp(2n ) + 1 anti. + nf fund. (see sec. 4.7). the

corresponding results are given in table 2, with the relevant s(x) given in table 1.

we can make several checks of our expressions (2.17) and (2.18). first of all, for pure sp(2n )

gauge theory, we have

2if1inst = 2(1)n

which agrees with the results of masuda and suzuki, and ito and sasakura [23] up to an overall

constant, which can be reabsorbed with a redenition of .

next, we can compare our one-instanton prediction for sp(4) without matter hypermultiplets

with the one-instanton result for so(5) without matter hypermultiplets as given by [20, 23]. the

order parameters ai of sp(4) are related to the order parameters di of so(5) by the change of

variables

a1 = (d1 + d2)/2,

a2 = (d1  d2)/2.

(2.20)

inserting eq. (2.20) into eq. (2.19) we nd again perfect agreement (up to an overall constant).

we can also compare our result (2.17) for sp(2) + nf fundamental hypermultiplets with

that for su(2) + nf fundementals as given for example in ref. [19]:

for nf = 0,

for nf = 1,

for nf = 2,

for nf = 3.

(2.21)




2if1inst =

again, we nd agreement up to a multiplicative constant, and a moduli-independent additive

term.

at rst glance, it appears that our result disagrees with the result for sp(2n ) with nf fun-

damental hypermultiplets given in ref. [20]. in ref. [20], however, at least two of the fundamental

hypermultiplets had vanishing masses. in that case, eq. (2.18) yields [ s0(0)]1/2 = 0, and hence

f1inst = 0 from eq. (2.17). thus, for the particular case of sp(2n ) with at least two massless

fundamental hypermultiplets, the rst non-trivial contribution to the instanton prepotential is

f2inst.

to make contact with the results in ref. [20], we calculate the two-instanton contribution to

the prepotential following the method of ref. [24]. the result is

1

x2 !x=0

.

(2.22)

2if2inst =

n

xk=1

sk(ak) +

note that sk(ak) contributes to two instantons (as it depends on l4), as we had anticipated.
further, from eq. (2.13), one may verify that 2 s0

x2 (0) = 0 when two or more of the hypermul-

tiplets are massless, so the only contribution to the two-instanton prepotential will be the rst

term in eq. (2.22), in complete agreement with [20].

for generic values of the masses of the matter hypermultiplets, we can check our two-

instanton result for sp(2) against the two-instanton result for su(2), given by the expres-

sions [19]:

2if2inst =

for nf = 3.

(2.23)

our results (2.22) agree with eq.

(2.23) up to an overall constant.

(for nf = 3 there is a

moduli-independent additive constant as well.)

finally, we can compare our two-instanton prediction (2.22) for sp(4) without matter hy-

permultiplets with the two-instanton result for so(5) obtained using the method of ref.

[24].

using the change of variables (2.20) we again nd agreement.6

3. universality

by examining f1inst obtained for all generic cases of classical groups in the coulomb phase,

6apparently, there is a misprint in eq. (3.9) for the two-instanton prepotential for so(n ) in ref. [20]. the

correct expression appears to be

table 4: table of equivalences (from s(x)).

an examination of table 1 leads to empirical rules for constructing s(x), where s(x) is

given as the product of factors, each corresponding to a dierent n = 2 multiplet in a given

representation of a classical group. these rules for the factors that make up s(x) are given in

table 3, which contains some new results, obtained in secs. 2 and 4 of this paper.

by examining table 3, one observes that certain pairs of (mass-deformed) elliptic models

15

have identical s(x), and therefore identical f1inst, for suitable choices of mass parameters and

moduli. these equivalences are presented in table 4. in each of the cases, one may verify that

f1loop is also identical for both sides.7 finally, one can verify that the curves are identical on

both sides of the rst line of the table, and that the leading-order terms (see section 4) of the

curves are identical on both sides of the remaining lines of the table. since it is very plausible

that s(x) determines the complete instanton expansion for a theory, we claim that table 4 likely

represents pairs of theories with identical prepotentials.

4. curves for decompactied elliptic models.

in secs. 4 and 5 of ref. [12], we reverse-engineered a curve for n = 2 su(n ) gauge theory

with two hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representation and nf < 4 hypermultiplets in

the fundamental representation using the regularities of the function s(x) observed in sec. 3

of this paper. this curve can be regarded as the decompactication of an elliptic model with

zero beta function, having two hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric representation and four

fundamental hypermultiplets, with the mass of one or more of the fundamental representations

sent to innity. the resulting sw curve remains of innite order in this limit.

a number of n = 2 theories with simple classical gauge groups can be understood as decom-

pactications of elliptic models. (by decompactication, we mean that the curve is formulated

on the covering space of the circular base space of the elliptic model.) the m-theory description

for these theories has been considered by uranga [5], but only for those with zero beta function.

the basic cell for these models (except for su(n ) with an adjoint hypermultiplet) contains

two o6 planes (with the same or opposite charges depending on the group and matter content),

together with one or two ns 5-branes, and a number of d4-branes and (possibly) d6-branes.

(we use the language of type iia theory, which is then considered to be lifted to m-theory.) in

7this has been previously observed for the third entry of the table in ref. [25].

16

most cases, no explicit curve, suitable for studying the instanton expansion, has been previously

presented (except for su(n ) with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet, for which the prepotential

was calculated in ref. [22]). in this section, we present curves and the resulting prepotentials for

those theories obtained as decompactications of the elliptic models discussed in [5].

the curve for a decompactied elliptic model has the form



xn=

lrn2

jn(x) pn(x) tn = 0,

(4.1)

where t = exp[(x6 + ix10)/r], x = x4 + ix5, and r = 1 (r = 2) if there are two (one) ns

5-branes per unit cell. the coecient functions pn(x) and jn(x) themselves have (in principle)

expansions in l,

pn(x) = pn(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)leading
jn(x) = jn(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)leading

+ o(l2) ,

+ o(l2) .

(4.2)

the leading-order terms in pn(x) are determined by the positions of the d4-branes (i.e., moduli

of the gauge theory) and the positions of the orientifold planes (i.e., masses of hypermultiplets

in two-index representations of the gauge group), while the leading-order terms of jn(x) are

associated with the positions of the d6-branes (i.e., masses of fundamental representations), if

present. we have not been able to uniquely determine the subleading terms in eq. (4.2).

the m-theory pictures corresponding to elliptic models with zero beta function are periodic

in both the x6 and x10 directions.

if we let z parametrize the torus with the identications

z  z + 21  z + 22, then t = ez with  = i/1. the shift z  z + 21 (or t  e2it)

corresponds to a translation by 2r in the x10 direction. the shift z  z + 22 (or t  q1t),

where q = e2i and  = 2/1, corresponds to a translation in the x6 direction (accompanied by

a translation in x10 if re  6= 0). the curves (4.1) derived from these pictures would likewise be

expected to be doubly periodic (up to a shift in x). periodicity in the x10 direction is automatic,

17

but periodicity in the x6 direction requires that l be replaced by q1/4, so (4.1) becomes



xn=

qrn2/4 enz jn(x) pn(x) = 0,

(4.3)

for theories with zero beta function. it further requires that pn(x) and jn(x) possess certain

symmetry properties. if there are two ns 5-branes per unit cell (as is the case for the su(n )

theories with symmetric or antisymmetric hypermultiplets that we consider), then

pn+2(x) = pn(x  ),

jn+2(x) = jn(x  ),

(4.4)

implies that the curves (4.1) and (4.3), with r = 1, are invariant under t  tl4 (or z  z +22)

and x  x +  (where  is the global mass, the relative mass of the two hypermultiplets

in two-index representations of su(n )). if there is only one ns 5-brane per unit cell (as in all

the so(n ) and sp(2n ) theories that we consider, or the su(n ) theory with a massive adjoint

hypermultiplet), then

pn+(x) = pn(x  m),

jn+(x) = jn(x  m),

(4.5)

guarantees that the curves (4.1) and (4.3), with r = 2, are invariant under t  tl4 (or

z  z+22) and x  x+m (where m is the global mass, the mass of the adjoint or antisymmetric

hypermultiplet).

the factors in the leading terms of pn(x) and jn(x) correspond not only to the d4-branes

which depend on the moduli, but also to the semi-innite non-dynamical d4-branes associ-

ated with the o6 planes and d6-branes [5, 26]. the placement of these non-dynamical d4-

branes is not unique, because they can extend either to the left or the right of the o6 plane

or d6-brane. dierent choices correspond precisely to dierent parametrizations of the curve

t  t/g(x), where g(x) is a rational function of x and positions of o6 planes and d6-branes.

18

the symmetries (4.4) or (4.5) will not be present unless the non-dynamical d4-branes are dis-

tributed symmetrically to the left and the right. in this paper, therefore, we will always choose

a parametrization of the curves that respects these symmetries, so that the invariance of the

curve under translations in x6 (together with a shift in x) will be manifest.

to determine the prepotential to 1-instanton accuracy, it is sucient [11][12] to consider

only the quartic truncation of the curve (4.1)

l4r j2(x) p2(x) t2 + lr j1(x) p1(x) t + j0(x) p0(x)

+ lr j1(x) p1(x)

1
t

+ l4r j2(x) p2(x)

1
t2 = 0.

(4.6)

the prepotential for the decompactied elliptic models may then be obtained by calculating

the period integrals ak and ad,k from the curve (4.1), and then integrating ad,k = f/ak.

applying residue methods [19] and hyperelliptic perturbation theory [8][12] to the quartic

truncation (4.6), one obtains8

f(a) = fclassical(a) + f1loop(a) + l2rf1inst(a),

(4.7)

where f1inst(a) is given by eqs. (3.3), (3.4), (3.5), or (3.6). in each case, the function s(x) is

given by

s(x) =

j1(x) j1(x) p1(x) p1(x)

j 2
0 (x) p 2

0 (x)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)leading

,

(4.8)

where only the leading-order terms of pn(x) and jn(x) are used in dening s(x). if there are no

d6-branes in the model, the factors of jn(x) are absent in (4.8). the o(l4r) terms in (4.6) are

essential in obtaining the one-instanton prepotential, which involves a delicate cancellation [8]

between these terms and the subleading terms in pn(x). this cancellation places constraints on

the form of these subleading terms, but does not necessarily uniquely determine them.

8for the sp(n ) theories, however, the one instanton prepotential is proportional to l2, not l2r.

19

in the rest of this section, we present results for each of several models, giving in each case:

a) a gure containing the m-theory picture of the model;

b) the leading-order terms of the coecient functions pn(x) and jn(x), i.e., those terms with

the lowest power in l or q for a given n;

c) the innite curve for each model (with leading-order coecients only);

d) the function s(x) calculated from each curve;

e) the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential;

f) various checks on the proposed curve and prepotential.

4.1. su(n ) + 2 antisymmetric + nf fundamentals

consider su(n ) gauge theory with two matter hypermultiplets (masses m1 and m2) in the

antisymmetric representation, and nf matter hypermultiplets (masses mj) in the fundamental

(dening) representation. the m-theory picture for this case, represented in fig. 1, contains an

innite chain of ns 5-branes, with an o6 plane coincident with each one. between each pair

of consecutive 5-branes there are n d4-branes and nf d6-branes.

the curve for this theory is given by eq. (4.1), with r = 1. a particular parametrization

for the functions pn(x) and jn(x) was given in ref. [12]. in this paper, as discussed above, we

21

choose a dierent parametrization, one in which the pn(x) and jn(x) have the symmetries

pn+2(x) = pn(x  ),

jn+2(x) = jn(x  ),

j1(x) = j0(x  m + 1

(4.1.5)

for nf = 4, the beta function vanishes, so the curve for this model is (4.3), with r = 1. when

the masses of the hypermultiplets satisfy m1 = m2 = 2mj (j = 1, . . . , 4), the curve becomes

hypermultiplets were dened to be 2m1 and 2m2 rather than m1 and m2, and the denition of

s(x) diered by a factor of 4.)

23

4.2. su(n ) + 1 antisymmetric + 1 symmetric

consider su(n ) gauge theory with one matter hypermultiplet (mass m1) in the antisym-

metric representation, and one (mass m2) in the symmetric representation. the corresponding

m-theory picture, represented in fig. 2, contains o6+ planes (related to the symmetric hyper-

multiplet) coincident with the even ns 5-branes, and o6 planes (related to the antisymmetric

hypermultiplet) coincident with the odd ns 5-branes.

it may be veried that in the m2   (m1  ) limit, the curve (4.2.1) reduces to the curve

(leading-order coecients only) for su(n ) with one antisymmetric (symmetric) hypermultiplet

[18].

in the case m1 = m2, i.e., zero global mass , the subleading terms of pn(x) vanish (the

eects of the orientifolds of opposite charge cancel, as they are located at the same position

in the x plane), and the curve (4.2.1) reduces to eq. (4.1.6), which, surprisingly, also describes

su(n ) with two antisymmetric hypermultiplets (masses m1 and m2) and four fundamental

hypermultiplets (masses mj), with m1 = m2 = 2mj. (see section 5 for more details.)

we can test the expression (4.2.5) in two particular cases. for su(2), we can compare

m2 = m in (4.2.6), with m the mass of the adjoint hypermultiplet, and a1 + a2 = 0, we nd

that both expressions agree up to a moduli independent additive constant. for su(3), we can

compare the prepotential (4.2.5) against that for su(3) with one symmetric representation and

one fundamental representation [10], nding agreement (after setting a1 + a2 + a3 = 0 and

m1 = mf ) up to a moduli independent additive constant.

26

4.3. su(n ) + adjoint

consider su(n ) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet (mass m) in the adjoint repre-

sentation. this is an elliptic model which can be described in terms of the m-theory picture in

fig 3.a. in this gure, there are n d4-branes suspended between a single ns 5-brane with a

periodicity in t, but with a shift in x of m (the global mass) for each circuit of t. the covering

space of the s1 (the t-variable) is shown in fig. 3b.

no subtraction is required in eq. (4.3.5), as there are no spurious singularities to remove from

4.4. so(2n ) + adjoint

consider so(2n ) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet (mass m) in the adjoint rep-

resentation. the corresponding m-theory picture (fig. 4) contains o6 planes on top of each

ns 5-brane, o6+ planes between each pair of ns 5-branes, and d4-branes. there are additional

fourbranes in mirror positions with respect to the o6+ orientifolds that are not represented in

we can compare our result for so(2n ) with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet with that of

minahan et. al. [28], who obtained a mass expansion for finstanton, using a conjectured recursion

relation for so(2n ) plus adjoint. expanding eqs. (4.4.8)(4.4.9) in powers of m, we nd the

we can make a further check of our proposed expression (4.4.8) by comparing the result for

so(6) with that for su(4). the one-instanton prepotential for su(4) with a massive adjoint

hypermultiplet is given by eq. (4.3.5), with moduli a

(4.4.11)

where ai are the moduli of so(6), we nd that the one-instanton prepotentials (4.3.5) and (4.4.8)

agree, up to a moduli-independent additive constant.

to construct our curve, we have used the m-theory picture suggested by uranga [5] in terms

of o6 planes. yokono [27] has constructed curves for so(2n ) using orientifold fourplanes

instead of o6 planes. his curves, while satisfying the correct decoupling limits (i) and (ii)

above, dier from ours. although the curves in ref. [27] have a smooth limit when m  0, the

brane conguration from which it is constructed is not consistent in this limit. when m = 0,

the fourbranes must change their charge when crossing an ns 5-brane [29], but this is not the

31

case for the m-theory picture in ref. [27]. (the same comments apply to the curves proposed for

sp(2n ) + adjoint and so(2n +1) + adjoint in ref. [27].) moreover, the prepotential constructed

from yokonos curve for so(6) with massive adjoint does not agree with that for su(4) with

massive adjoint.

32

4.5. so(2n + 1) + adjoint

consider so(2n + 1) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet (mass m) in the adjoint

representation. the m-theory picture in fig. 5 is similar to the one for so(2n ) with adjoint

hypermultiplet with the following dierence: there is an additional fourbrane whose position is

xed at the o6+ plane in each cell [5]. as in last sections, there are additional fourbranes at

mirror positions that are not included in the gure.

ns 5-brane, o6 planes between each pair of ns 5-branes, and d4-branes. as in the previous

section, there are additional fourbranes at mirror symmetric positions with respect to the o6

orientifolds that are not exhibited in fig. 6 for clarity.

as in section 4.4, we can consider some decoupling limits to check eq. (4.6.1).

and a moduli-independent additive constant. we can also test eqs. (4.6.5) and (4.6.6) for sp(4)

with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet against eqs. (4.5.5) and (4.5.6) for so(5) with a massive

adjoint hypermultiplet. using the change of variables (2.20) relating the moduli of so(5) and

sp(4), one can show that the two results agree up to a rescaling, and a moduli-independent

additive constant. this is actually a consistency check of our methods rather than a truly

independent test.

4.7. sp(2n ) + 1 antisymmetric + nf fundamentals

consider sp(2n ) gauge theory with a matter hypermultiplet (mass m) in the antisymmetric

representation, and nf  4 matter hypermultiplets (masses mj) in the fundamental represen-

tation. the m-theory picture in fig. 7 contains o6 planes on top of each ns 5-brane, o6

planes between each pair of ns 5-branes, together with d4-branes and d6-branes. as in previ-

ous examples, there are additional d4-branes and d6-branes at mirror symmetric positions with

respect to the o6 orientifolds that are not depicted in fig. 7.

which agrees with the one-instanton prepotential for sp(2) with nf fundamental hypermultiplets

(up to a moduli-independent additive constant and an overall rescaling), as expected, since the

antisymmetric representation of sp(2) is trivial. the result for sp(4) with 1 antisymmetric

hypermultiplet and no fundamental hypermultiplets agrees with the one-instanton prepotential

for so(5) with one fundamental hypermultiplet [20] (see table 1) up to a rescaling and a moduli

independent additive constant, after making the change of variables (2.20).

5. comparison to elliptic curves with zero global mass

complementary to our strategy of deriving curves from the m-theory pictures of uranga

[2][5], there exist methods developed for elliptic models by donagi and witten [4], uranga [5],

gukov and kapustin [6], and others. although a curve results from their considerations, the

extraction of the instanton expansion has not been carried out for these curves. in short, the

issue is how to extract pn(x) and jn(x), and from these, s(x), from the curves of the donagi-

witten type.

in this section, we accomplish this for two non-trivial models with zero beta

function and zero global mass.

the curves for theories in sec. 4 with only one ns 5-brane per unit cell become trivial (i.e.,

factorize into a function of x and a function of t [5]) when the global mass m vanishes. this

yields s(x) = constant, and a vanishing one-loop and instanton prepotential. on the other hand,

the curves for theories with two ns 5-branes per unit cell, viz., su(n ) with two antisymmetric

hypermultiplets and four fundamental hypermultiplets, and su(n ) with one antisymmetric and

one symmetric hypermultiplet, both have the non-trivial limit (4.1.6) when the global mass 

vanishes. we show that the curves obtained by gukov and kapustin, and uranga, respectively,

for these two models agree, after a suitable change of variables, with eq. (4.1.6).

5.1. su(n ) + 2 antisymmetric + 4 fundamentals

consider the su(n ) gauge theory, with two antisymmetric hypermultiplets (masses m1 and

m2) and four fundamental hypermultiplets (masses mj), with their masses related by m1 =

40

m2 = 2mj . this is an elliptic model with zero global mass. gukov-kapustin [6] give the curve

for su(2n)

v2n + f1(x, y)v2n1 +    + f2n(x, y) = 0,

(5.1.1)

with the coecient functions

f2j(x, y) = aj,

f2j1(x, y) =

ybj

(x  e3)

=

(x  e1)(x  e2)

y

bj,

(5.1.2)

where v = x4 + ix5 is what we called x in earlier sections, aj and bj are constants, and x and

y parametrize the torus base space via

y2 = (x  e1)(x  e2)(x  e3).

(5.1.3)

we will assume that precisely the same functions (5.1.2) appear in the curve for su(n ) with n

odd, so the curve for any n takes the form:

vn + f1(x, y)vn 1 +    + fn 1(x, y)v + fn (x, y) = 0.

(5.1.4)

let

h0(v) =

which denes the uj as gauge invariant combinations of m and the order parameters aj (with

u0 = 1). let also

heven = xi even

uivn i,

h0 = heven + hodd,

hodd = xi odd

uivn i,

(1)n h1 = heven  hodd.

(5.1.6)

then (5.1.4) can be written as

heven(v) +

(x  e1)(x  e2)

y

hodd(v) = 0,

(5.1.7)

where we identify u2j = aj, and u2j1 = bj.

when pi ei = 0 in eq. (5.1.3), the variables x and y are related to the weierstrass elliptic

functions by

x = (z)

2y = (z),

(5.1.8)

where z parametrizes the base torus with the identications z  z + 21  z + 22, and therefore

(5.1.13)

42

one may redene the gauge invariant moduli as follows:

uj,

j even,

uj/c,

j odd,

(5.1.14)

u

j = 


which is valid since (5.1.10) is independent of  and v. next, we shift    +

) = 3(2|2 )  2(2|2 ),

(5.1.17)

eq. (5.1.16) becomes, for both even or odd n ,

h0(v) 3(2|2 ) + h1(v) 2(2|2 ) = 0.

(5.1.18)

this result exactly agrees with our result (4.1.6), when we set v = x + 1

2 m. this supports the

validity of the methods used in obtaining the curves in sec. 4. further, we know that for this

case of zero global mass, the functions pn(x) do not have any subleading terms, from two points

of view: (a) the exact agreement of the leading terms with eq. (5.1.18), and (b) the absence of

subtractions for the one-instanton prepotential.

43

5.2. su(n ) + 1 antisymmetric + 1 symmetric

for zero global mass, uranga [5] gives the curve (5.1.4) with

f2j(x, y) = cj,

f2j1(x, y) =

ydj

(x  e1)(x  e2)

=

(x  e3)

y

dj.

the curve for this case, with m1 = m2, is therefore

heven(v) +

y

(x  e1)(x  e2)

hodd(v) = 0,

where we identify u2j = cj and u2j1 = dj. following (5.1.8)-(5.1.13), we have

(5.2.1)

(5.2.2)

heven(v) + cf (| )hodd(v) = 0,

(5.2.3)

with c and f (| ) dened by eqs. (5.1.10) and (5.1.11) respectively. we redene the gauge

invariant moduli as

further, we shift    + 

4 if n is even, and    + 

4 + 1

2 if n is odd. (note that the shifts

uj,

j even,

c uj,

j odd.

(5.2.4)

u

j = 


for even and odd n are the reverse of those in the previous section.) this transforms the curve

(5.2.3) into eq. (5.1.18), agreeing with the result (4.1.6) obtained in sec. 4, with no subleading

terms for the pn(x).

thus, for su(n ) + 2 anti. + 4 fund. and su(n ) + 1 sym. + 1 anti. with zero global

mass in both cases (and m = 2mj for the former), the curves are identical, i.e., the two theories

have identical prepotentials. this was already noted in table 4, at the one-instanton level. one

may wonder from the m-theory point of view why this has occurred. from fig. 1 for su(n ) +

2 anti. + 4 fund., we see that, if all the masses are equal, the positions of the d6-branes have

the same value of v (x in the gure) as that of the two o6 orientifold planes. one may then

bring the four d6-branes coincident with one of the o6 planes, converting this eectively to

44

an o6+ plane. the resulting conguration is that of su(n ) + 1 sym. + 1 anti. for zero global

mass. hence, the identity of the low-energy theories with zero global mass could have been

anticipated. on the other hand, if there are global masses, this construction is not possible and

the curves no longer coincide.

6. comparison with the curve of donagi and witten

the m-theory picture corresponding to the su(n ) gauge theory with massive adjoint hyper-

multiplet [2] is described in sec. 4.3 (see figs. 3.a and 3.b). using this, we obtained the curve

(4.3.3)

where



xn=

(1)nqn(n1)/2 enz h(v  nm) = 0,

h(v) =

n

yi=1

(v  ai),

(6.1)

(6.2)

with v = x4 + ix5 (previously referred to as x), and q = e2i . as before, z parametrizes the

base torus with the identications z  z + 21  z + 22, and throughout this section we x

1 = i (hence  = 1) for convenience. this is exactly the curve derived in ref. [22, 31], for

the calogero-moser model.

on the other hand, witten [2] shows that the curve for this model is precisely that derived

by donagi and witten [4] in the context of the integrable hitchin system

f (v, x, y) =

ajpn j(v),

n

xj=0

(6.3)

where aj are gauge invariant polynomials in ai and m, and where x and y are related by (5.1.3).

they show that

we will establish the connection between the curves (6.1) and (6.5), which has not been done

explicitly previously. the curve (6.1) can be recast as

where

hj(z) =

eq. (6.8) becomes

this is similar but not identical to the comparison of the spectral curve with the donagi-witten

curve made by itoyama and morozov [32], to which we refer the reader for further discussion of

this issue.

in this section and in section 5 we have dealt with elliptic models that have no subleading

terms for the coecient functions pn(x).

it remains an open question how to carry out the

analogous studies for elliptic models with a global mass and non-vanishing subleading terms.

47

7. concluding remarks

in this paper, we have provided a rather comprehensive presentation of the relationship of

elliptic models to m-theory, and related topics. there are, however, a number of topics which

deserve further attention, as they represent issues not completely understood.

first, the information in tables 1 and 3 would appear to have an underlying group-theoretic

explanation. that is, given the group and matter content, one should be able to predict the

factors in table 3, without appealing to a sw curve. we know of no such explanation.

second, for a number of elliptic models, only the leading terms of the coecient functions

pn(x) are known. (the leading term is that with the lowest power of  or q for a given power of

t.) this occurs for all models in section 4 with non-zero global mass except su(n ) + adjoint.

in these models, the subleading terms are not known. some non-elliptic models, namely su(n )

+ 1 anti. + nf fund. and sp(2n ) + nf fund. (treated in section 2), also contain subleading

terms, which are explicitly known in these cases. comparison with table 2 correlates models

with subleading terms with entries in the table in which f1inst involves terms other than sk(ak)

(e.g., [ s0(0)]1/2, or subtractions of factors such as sm( 1

2 m)). these additional terms are closely

connected to the residue functions rk(x), e.g., eq. (2.8), which originate in the subleading terms,

and which generate the additional terms via identities such as eq. (2.14) (leading in the case

of sp(2n ) + nf fund. to eq. (2.17)). thus, the existence of subleading terms and the need

for the subtractions listed in table 2 are dierent aspects of the same issue. the subtractions

listed in table 2 for models described in sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.4 through 4.7, do not, however,

give enough information to determine the subleading terms. a greater understanding of these

subleading terms would be desirable.

finally, there are a number of elliptic models described in section 4 which have not been

identied with known integrable models. it would improve our understanding of the subject if

these connections could be made.

48

in conclusion, this paper represents considerable progress toward a unied description of

elliptic models associated with m-theory. nevertheless, as outlined above, there remain a number

of interesting issues to consider.
