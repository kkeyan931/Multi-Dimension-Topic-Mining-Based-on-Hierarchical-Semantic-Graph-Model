abstract

a generalization of super-lie algebras is presented. it is then shown that all known
examples of fractional supersymmetry can be understood in this formulation. however,
the incorporation of three dimensional fractional supersymmetry in this framework
needs some care. the proposed solutions lead naturally to a formulation of a fractional
supersymmetry starting from any representation d of any lie algebra g. this involves
taking the f throots of d in an appropriate sense. a fractional supersymmetry in
any space-time dimension is then possible. this formalism nally leads to an innite
dimensional extension of g, reducing to the centerless virasoro algebra when g =
sl(2, ir ).

1 introduction

describing the laws of physics in terms of underlying symmetries has always been a powerful
tool. in this respect, it is interesting to study the kind of symmetries which are allowed in
space-time. within the framework of quantum field theory (unitarity of the s matrix etc)
it is generally admitted that we cannot go beyond supersymmetry (susy). however, the no-
go theorem stating that supersymmetry is the only non-trivial extension beyond the poincare
algebra is valid only if one considers lie or super-lie algebras. indeed, if one considers lie
algebras, the coleman and mandula theorem [1] allows only trivial extensions of the poincare
symmetry, i.e. extra symmetries must commute with the poincare generators. in contrast,
if we consider superalgebras, the theorem of haag, lopuszanski and sohnius [2] shows that
we can construct a unique (up to the number of supercharges) superalgebra extending the
poincare lie algebra non-trivially. it may seem that these two theorems encompass all pos-
sible symmetries of space-time. but, if one examines the hypotheses of the above theorems,
one sees that it is possible to imagine symmetries which go beyond supersymmetry. several
possibilities have been considered in the literature [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], the
intuitive idea being that the generators of the poincare algebra are obtained as an appro-
priate product of more fundamental additional symmetries. these new generators are in
a representation of the lorentz group which can be neither bosonic nor fermionic (bosonic
charges close under commutators and generate a lie algebra, whilst fermionic charges close
under anticommutators and induce super-lie algebras). in this paper we propose an alge-
braic structure, called an f lie algebra, which makes this idea precise in the context of
fractional supersymmetry (fsusy) of order f . of course, when f = 1 this is a lie algebra,
and when f = 2 this is a super-lie algebra. we show that all examples of fsusy considered
in the literature can be described within this framework.

fsusy (f > 2) has been investigated in dimensions one, two and three.

in 1d the
algebraic structure is relatively simple [6, 7, 8] (one just adds a new supercharge q such that
qf = t). in two dimensions, one can add either two or an innite number of additional
generators [9, 10, 11]. in three dimensions the situation is more complicated. we showed [12]
that it is possible to inject equivariantly the vector representation of so(1, 2) in a quotient
of the f th symmetric product of an appropriate representation d1/f of so(1, 2). in other
words, we were able to express the generators of space-time translations as symmetric f 
order polynomials in more fundamental generators but with the new supercharges satisfying
extra constraints. we also constructed explicitly in [12] unitary representations of the corre-
sponding algebraic structure which can be understood as relativistic anyons [14, 15, 16, 17].
however, it was not possible to consider translations as f order symmetric products of
the new supercharges without imposing extra constraints. in contrast, this problem exists

1

neither in dimensions one and two [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], nor in any dimension when f = 2 (susy).
to understand the results of our paper [12] in terms of f lie algebras, we propose two
solutions: (i) extending the vectorial representation or, (ii) extending the poincare algebra
b = t  so(1, 2) to b = t  vir, where so(1, 2)  vir is the virasoro (without central charge)
algebra and t a representation of vir which extends the vectorial representation of so(1, 2).
correspondingly we also have to extend the d1/f representation of so(1, 2) to d1/f .

the problem encountered in 3d fsusy and especially the solution we propose to solve
it, enables us to dene a general method of associating an fsusy to any representation d of
any lie algebra g. this algebraic structure is in general associated to a non unitary innite
dimensional representation of g. furthermore, as for so(1, 2), one can dene an innite
dimensional lie algebra v (g) having g as a sub-algebra and leading to an f lie algebra.

the content of this paper is as follows. in section two, we give a precise mathematical
denition of the algebraic structure which underlies fsusy. several simple examples are
then given.
in section 3, we show how one can incorporate 3d fsusy into this general
mathematical description by extending the vectorial representation to an appropriate re-
ducible (but indecomposable) representation. we then construct fsusy starting from any
semi-simple lie algebra g (playing the role of so(1, 2)) and any representation d (playing
the role of the vector representation). this construction involves taking the f throot of d
in some sense.
in particular this means that one can construct fsusy in all space-time
dimensions. in section 4, we study an f lie algebra associated to an innite dimensional
algebra v (g) having g as a sub-algebra. for g = so(1, 2), v (g) reduces to the centerless
virasoro algebra.

2 algebraic structure of fractional supersymmetry

in this section, we give the abstract mathematical structure which underlies this paper and
which generalizes the theory of lie super-algebras and their (unitary) representations. let
f be a positive integer and q = exp ( 2i
f ). we consider a complex vector space s together
with a linear map  from s into itself satisfying f = 1. we set ak = sqk and b = s1 (where
s is the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue  of ) so that s = b f 1
k=1 ak. the
map  is called the grading. if s is endowed with the following structures we will say that
s is a fractional super lie algebra (f -lie algebra for short):

1. b is a lie algebra and ak is a representation of b. we write these structures as a
bracket [b, x] with the understanding that [b, x] = [x, b] if x  ak, b  b. it is
clear that [(x), (y )] =  ([x, y ]).

2

2. there are multilinear, bequivariant (i.e. which respect the action of b) maps
{ ,    , } : sf (ak)  b from sf (ak) into b.
in other words, we assume that
some of the elements of the lie algebra b can be expressed as f th order symmetric
products of more fundamental generators. here sf (d) denotes the f fold sym-
metric product of d. it is then easy to see that:

{(a1),    , (af )} =  ({a1,    , af }) , ai  ak.

(2.1)

3. for bi  b and aj  ak the following jacobi identities hold:

[[b1, b2] , b3] + [[b2, b3] , b1] + [[b3, b1] , b2] = 0

[[b1, b2] , a3] + [[b2, a3] , b1] + [[a3, b1] , b2] = 0

[b, {a1, . . . , af }] = {[b, a1] , . . . , af } + . . . + {a1, . . . , [b, af ]}
f +1

(2.2)

[ai, {a1, . . . , ai1, ai+1, . . . , af +1}] = 0.

xi=1

the rst identity is the usual jacobi identity for lie algebras, the second says that
the ak are representation spaces of b and the third is just the leibniz rule (or the
equivariance of { ,    , }). the fourth identity is the analogue of the graded leibniz
rule of super-lie algebras for f lie algebras

if we want to be able to talk about unitarity, we also require the following additional struc-

ture and in this case, s is called an f lie algebra with adjoint.

4. a conjugate linear map  from s into itself such that:

a)
b)

c)

(s) = s, s  s

[a, b] =hb, ai

(s) = (s)

d) {a1,    , af } =n(a1) ,    , (af )o ,

(2.3)

a  ak.

from a) and c) we see that for x  b we have x   b, and that for x  ak, we have
x   af k.

a unitary representation of an f lie algebra with adjoint s is a linear map  : s 
end(h), (where h is a hilbert space and end(h) the space of linear operators acting on h)
and a unitary endomorphism  such that f = 1 which satisfy

3

a)  ([x, y]) = (x)(y)  (y)(x)
b)  {a1.    , af } = 1

f ! psf

(cid:16)a(1)(cid:17)    (cid:16)a(f )(cid:17)

c) (s) = (s)
d)  (s) 1 =  ( (s))

(2.4)

(sf being the group of permutations of f elements). note that with the normalisation of
b), when f = 2, one has ({a1, a2}) = 1/2(a1a2 + a2a1) instead of the usual ({a1, a2}) =
(a1a2 + a2a1). as a consequence of these properties, since the eigenvalues of  are fth roots
of unity, we have the following decomposition of the hilbert space

h =

hk,

f 1

mk=0

where hk =n|hi  h :  |hi = qk |hio. the operator n  end(h) (the set of linear opera-

tors acting on h) dened by n |hi = k |hi if |hi  hk is the number operator (obviously
qn = ). since (b) = (b), b  b each hk provides a representation of the lie algebra
b. furthermore, for a  a, (a) = q(a) and so we have (a).hk  hk+(mod f)

remark 1:
for all k = 1,    , f  1 it is clear that the subspace b  ak of s satises (2.1-2.2) and the
subspace b  ak  ak satises (2.1-2.3) (when s has an adjoint).
remark 2:
it is important to notice that bracket {  } is a priori not dened for elements in dierent
gradings.
remark 3:
if we set

bir =nb  b : b = bo
air =na  a : a = ao,

(2.5)

then sir = bir  air is stable by  and satises (2.1-2.2). here we use the normalizations
conventionally used in mathematical literature (no i factor in the structure constants of the
algebra). for physicists, notice that if b = b then (ib) is hermitian.

example 1:

obviously, a 1lie algebra is just a lie algebra. a 2lie algebra is just a lie super-algebra:
s = b  a1, with even part b and odd part a1. in supersymmetry, because of the spin

4

statistics theorem a1 is a fermionic representation of b. note that the jacobi identities
(2.2) above reduce to the standard jacobi identities of a super-lie algebra. if we consider
unitarity in susy, property (2.3), (2.4) above have also to be considered but for the super-
poincare algebra, the nature of  depends very much on the dimension of the space-time
and the signature of the metric (majorana, weyl, majorana-weyl, su(2)majorana and
su(2)majorana-weyl conditions).

example 2:

let v be nite dimensional complex vector space and let  : v  v be a linear operator
satisfying f = 1. then

where vk = n|vi  v :  |vi = qk |vio. we dene

v = f 1

k=0 vk,

and s = b f 1

k=1 ak (with b = a0). since aka  ak+(mod f ) one has

ak =nf  end(v ) :   f  1 = qkfo

[a0, ak]  ak

f  times

{z

(2.6)

(2.7)

the bracket [ , ] of s is dened by (2.6) and {  } : sf (ak)  b by

{a1    af } = 1/f ! psf

a(1)    a(f ). the rst three jacobi (2.2) identities are clearly sat-

ised, and calculation shows that the last jacobi identity also holds. thus s is an f lie
algebra. if v is endowed with a hermitian metric and  is a unitary operator then adjunction
denes an adjoint on the f lie algebra s.

example 3:

in 1d [6, 7, 8] the simplest f lie algebra is two dimensional, and is generated by the

operators t, q with the relation qf = t. we take b = dte, the translation in time, and
a1 = dqe . we obviously have (t) = t and (q) = qq. an explicit representation in

terms of generalized grassmann variables [18, 19, 20, 21, 22] can be constructed [6, 7, 8]. it
is possible to extend this f lie algebra to a f lie algebra with adjoint by the addition of
one more generator, q, such that (q) = q1q, (q)f = (t) = t. let us recall once
again that there are no algebraic relations between q and q.

5

example 4:

in 2d there are several possible algebras. the simplest one is obtained by considering the 3

generators z, z and qz. we set b =dz, ze and a1 = dqze, the relations are (qz)f = z

and [z, qz] = [z, qz] = 0.
this f lie algebra can be extended to a 4dimensional f lie algebra with adjoint by
adding one more generator qz  a1 such that (z) = z, (qz)f = z and (qz) = qz
[9, 10].
there is also a more complicated algebraic extension, involving an innite number of gener-
ators which corresponds to an extension of the virasoro algebra without central charge. in
addition to the virasoro generators ln, ln n  zz we add the generators gr, r  zz + 1/f ,
which correspond to the modes of a eld of conformal weight 1+1/f and satisfy the following
relations [11]

[ln, lm] = (n  m)lm+n

hln, lmi = (n  m)lm+n
hln, lmi = 0
hln, gri = 0

[ln, gr] = (

{gr1,    , grf } = lr1++rf ,

n
f

 r)gn+r

(2.8)

here we take b = vir  vir and a1 = dgr, r  zz + 1/fe.

in this extension, we have
 qz. we can also include an adjoint by adding a1 = a1. as in
l1  z, l1  z and g 1
1d, it is possible to construct an explicit realisation of the above algebras using generalised
grassmann variables [11, 9, 10].

f

in all the given examples, appropriate representations have been obtained in terms of
adapted superelds [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. to our knowledge, unitarity remains an unsolved problem.

in three dimensions, the situation is much more complicated and we will study this in

the next section.

example 5

let g be a complex lie algebra and let r, r be representations of g such that there is a
gequivariant map  : sf (r)  r. we set

s = b  a1 = (g  r)  r.

6

b = g  r is a lie algebra as the semi-direct product of g and r (the latter with the trivial
bracket). we can extend the action of g on r to an action of b on r by letting r act trivially
on r. this denes the bracket [ ,
] on s. for the map {  } we take . the rst three
jacobi identities (2.2) are clearly satised, and the fourth is also satised as each term in
the expression of the l.h.s vanishes.

for example, if

is a decomposition into irreducible summands, then for a given k

sf (r) = krk,

sk = (g  rk)  r,

is an f lie algebra.
as an illustration, if g = so(1, 2) and r = 2  1 (the spin representation plus the trivial
representation), then s3(2  1) = s3(2)  s2(2)  2  1 = 4  3  2  1 and it is possible
to obtain the spinorial or the vectorial representations of so(1, 2) from a symmetric product
of order 3. this can be compared with the result of r. kerner [3] where a cubic root of the
dirac equation is obtained. more generally, for any f :

sf (2  1) = sf (2)  sf 1(2)      1 = (f + 1)  f      1.

3 fractional supersymmetry and nite dimensional lie

algebras

3.1 fractional supersymmetry in three dimensions

in [12] we considered fsusy in three dimensions. in order to understand our results in term
of f lie algebras let us introduce a realisation of so(1, 2) which is convenient for explicit
calculations. let f be the vector space of functions on ir 2,
+ = {(x, y)  ir 2 : x, y > 0}.
consider the linear operators acting on f given by

j = xy

j0 =

1
2

(yy  xx)

j+ = yx.

(3.1)

these operators satisfy the commutation relations

7

[j, j+] = 2j0

[j0, j+] = j+

[j0, j] = j,

(3.2)

and thus generate the lie algebra so(1, 2). it is easy to check that the following subspaces
of f are representations of so(1, 2):

d+

dn = d x2n, x2n1y,    , xy2n1, y2ne,
x(cid:19)m
 = d x2(cid:18) y
y!m
 = d y2 x

, m  ine,
, m  ine,

(cid:16)  ir \ in/2(cid:17)
(cid:16)  ir \ in/2(cid:17).

(cid:16)n  in/2(cid:17)

d

(3.3)

of course other representations can also be obtained (for instance unbounded from below
and above) but they are not useful for our purpose.

the representation dn is the (2n + 1)dimensional irreducible representation and the
representations d
 are innite dimensional representations, bounded from below and above
respectively. it is important to emphasize that the representations given in (3.3) do not have
the normalizations conventionally used in the literature and the basis is not orthonormal, but
those normalizations are convenient for further developments. for a general classication of
the representations of three-parameter lie algebras, see e.g. [23] where analogous monomials

1/f,. these are are related to the

y(cid:17)m
(of the form xy(cid:16) x

in the paper [12] we introduced four representations, d

in this article, for practical reasons we work only with the representations (3.3).

the multiplication map mn : f      f  f given by

mn(f1,    , fn) = f1    fn

(3.4)

is multilinear and totally symmetric and hence induces a map f from sf (f ) into f .

restricting to sf (cid:16)d

f lie algebra

(3.6)

in [12], by considering an adapted conjugations  : d+
and from the wigner
induced representation we proved that the representations of 3d-fsusy are unitary and
induce a symmetry between relativistic anyons.

1/f = (cid:16)d

1/f(cid:17)

looking at the representations dened in (3.5) i.e. sf (d

1/f )red, one sees that, even
though d1 is a subspace stable under so(1, 2) there is no complement stable under so(1, 2)
[12]. indeed, these representations cannot be built from a primitive vector. this is due to
the fact that j 3
j 3
this is the reson why there is no f lie algebra structure on so(1, 2)  d1.

+(cid:16)x2(cid:17) = 0 and consequently we cannot reach x1y3 from x2 but conversely
 (cid:16)x1y3) = 6x2 (such reducible but indecomposable representations also appear in [23]).

3.2 extension to any lie algebra

we consider now g a complex semi-simple lie algebra of rank r and d an arbitrary repre-
sentation. the purpose of this section, is to construct an f lie algebra s = b  a1 such
that the lie algebra b contains the semi-direct product g  d. if g = so(1, 2) and d is the
vector representation, this construction leads to the f lie algebra (3.6) above.

let h be a cartan sub-algebra of g, let   h (the dual of h) be the corresponding set of
roots and let f be the one dimensional root space associated to   . we choose a basis
{hi, i = 1,    , r} of h and elements e  f such that the commutation relations become

[hi, hj] = 0
[hi, e] = ie

[e, e] = 


{, }e+
2.h

(3.7)

recall that the real lie algebra spanned by the hi and the e is the split real form of g,
and that the real lie algebra spanned by ihj, e  e and i(e + e) is the compact
real form of g.

we now introduce {(1),    , (r)} (the positive roots) a basis of simple roots. the weight
lattice w (g)  h is the set of vectors  such that 2.
.  zz and, as is well known, there is
a basis of the weight lattice consisting of the fundamental weights {(1),    , (r)} dened by
2(i).(j)
ni(i) is called dominant if all the ni  0 and it is well known
(j).(j)
that the set of dominant weights is in one to one correspondence with the set of (equivalence
classes of) irreducible nite dimensional representations of g.

= ij. a weight  =

pi=1

r

recall briey how one can associate a representation of g to   h. in u(g), the universal

enveloping algebra of g, let i be the left-ideal generated by the elements

ne( > 0), hi  (hi).i(hi  h)o, where i is the identity of u(g) and hi = 2 (i).hi

the lie algebra g acts on u(g) by left multiplication, i is stable under this action and
therefore the quotient v = u(g)/i is a representation space of g: v is a highest weight
representation and is called the verma module associated to  [24]. if  is dominant, then
v has a unique maximal proper sub-representation m and the quotient d = v/m is an
irreducible nite dimensional representation of g.

2

.

(i)

to come back to our original problem, consider a nite dimensional irreducible represen-
tation d of g. if v/f is the verma module associated to /f , there is a gequivariant
map

because i      i  sf (cid:16)v/f(cid:17) is a highest weight vector of weight . taking the quotient

by m one obtains a gequivariant inclusion

i : v  sf (cid:16)v/f(cid:17) ,

(3.8)

since d = v/m. denoting sf (cid:16)v/f(cid:17) /i(m) by sf (cid:16)d/f(cid:17)red

d  sf (cid:16)v/f(cid:17) /i(m),

(3.9)

then, as in example 5,

is naturally an f lie algebra.

s = (g  sf (cid:16)d/f(cid:17)red

)  v/f

(3.10)

we can reformulate this construction in less abstract terms. if |i is the primitive vector
associated to a dominant weight  (i.e. (e |i = 0,  > 0 and hi |i = ni |i = (hi) |i)),
the representation d is generated by the action of the e,  < 0 on |i. because the
representation is nite dimensional, corresponding to the highest weight state |i we have
i(i) (e |i = 0,  < 0). of course the two representations
n
a lowest state |i,  =
built with  or  are the same. but, if the weight is not dominant the situation is more

pi=1

involved. for our purposes, to the representation d we associate two innite dimensional
representations: one associated to the weight 
respectively (the rst
is bounded from below and the second from above). these two inequivalent representations
are characterized by primitive vectors:

in the previous section we constructed a canonical f lie algebra

s = (g  sf (cid:16)d/f(cid:17)red

)  d/f

(4.12)

associated to a nite dimensional lie algebra g and an irreducible nite dimensional repre-
sentation d. in this section we will show that one can extend the representation g in d to
a representation of an innite dimensional lie algebra v (g) in d, and construct an f lie
algebra containing (4.12) as a sub-algebra.

4.1 so(1, 2) and the virasoro algebra

it is well know that the virasoro algebra admits so(1, 2) as a sub-algebra. the action (3.1)
of so(1, 2) on f extends to an action of the virasoro algebra (without central extension) on
f by setting

ln =

n + 1

2 (cid:18) y
x(cid:19)n

xx +

n  1

2 (cid:18) y
x(cid:19)n

yy, n  zz.

(4.13)

one can verify the commutation relations

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m

(4.14)

11

and that j = l1, j0 = l0, j+ = l1.

in analogy with the representations (3.3) of so(1, 2) we dene representations of vir as

follows:

d+

dn = d f (n)
 = d f (+,)
 = d f (,)

x(cid:19)m
mn = x2n(cid:18) y
x(cid:19)m
m = x2(cid:18) y
m = y2  x
y!m

, m  zze,
, m  zze,
, m  zze,

d

(n  in/2)

(  ir \ in/2)

(4.15)

(  ir \ in/2) .

then, one can check explicitly that the action of vir on (4.15) is given by

p

lk(cid:16)f (n)
lk(cid:16)f (+,)
lk(cid:16)f (,)

p

p

k+p

(cid:17) = (kn  p)f (n)
(cid:17) = (k  p)f (+,)
(cid:17) = (k  p)f (+,)

k+p

k+p

(4.16)

,

where the indices in (4.15) are chosen in such a way that they correspond to the eigenvalues
of l0 i.e. the helicity. in the language of conformal eld theory, f (n)
and f (,)
correspond to the modes of conformal elds of conformal weight n + 1 and  + 1 respectively.
finally, we observe that the the representations (3.3) are included in the corresponding
representations (4.15) and in each case that the action of vir extends the action of so(1, 2).
let us remark that these representations are all unbounded from below and above (i.e. they
cannot be obtained from primitive vectors or a highest/lowest weight state).

the fundamental property of these representations is that there is a vir-equivariant map

from sf(cid:16) d+

1/f(cid:17) and sf(cid:16) d

1/f(cid:17) to d1. this is just the multiplication map f : f  f

(see (3.4)) which is obviously vir-equivariant. in fact, a direct calculation shows that

and hence that sf ( d

sf ( d

= f(cid:16)sf ( d
1/f )red and d1 are isomorphic.

1/f )(cid:17) = d1,

by the method explained in example 5,

denoting d1 = d pm1 = f (1)

s = (cid:16)vir  d1(cid:17)  d+

the brackets in s are given explicitly by the following formulae:

remark any weight  of the lie algebra so(1, 2) can be considered as a weight  of vir if we
set (l0) = (j0) [24]. as in section 3.1, we can construct the associated verma module
and dene the f lie algebra

s = (vir  sf (cid:16)v/f(cid:17)red

)  v/f

(4.20)

with obvious notation (see (3.10). of course this construction is dierent from the previous
one (4.18) since v/f is a highest weight representation of vir.

4.2 the construction of v (g)

in this section, we will construct an innite dimensional lie algebra v (g) which contains the
lie algebra g in the same way as vir contains sl(2).

let g be a semi-simple complex lie algebra, let h be a cartan sub-algebra, let + be the

positive roots and let ((1),    , (r)) be the positive simple roots.
we consider the vector space v generated by

v = dli

0 , l
n :

i = 1,    , r,   +, n  zze

satisfying the commutation relations:

1.

(a) for positive simple roots (1),    , (r),

(4.25)

the relations (4.22), (4.23) and (4.25) do not specify all commutators [l

2 ] if  6= ). in order to obtain a lie algebra from (4.22), (4.23) and (4.25) we dene

n, l

[l

where t(cid:16)v(cid:17) is the tensorial algebra on v and i is the two-sided ideal generated by the

relations (4.22), (4.23) and (4.25). v (g) is an associative algebra but we will consider it as a

(4.26)

v (g) = t(cid:16)v(cid:17)/i,

14

lie algebra for the induced lie bracket (i.e. commutator). the universal property of v (g)
is the following: any linear map f : v  end(h) such that the f (l
n) satisfy the relations
(4.22), (4.23) and (4.25) extends to a unique lie algebra homomorphism f : v (g)  end(h).
the relations (4.22), (4.23) and (4.25) can be arranged in the following diagram (for g =
su(3))

of course similar diagrams can be constructed for higher rank lie algebra, and the results
can be easily extend to all lie algebras g. this diagram has a concentric and radial structure.
the concentric symmetry is just the manifestation that to any positive n can be associated an
algebra isomorphic to g (see (4.23)). the radial symmetries extend the sl(2) (generated by
(l
1)) algebra to vir a virasoro algebra (see (4.25)). finally, composing concentric and
radial symmetries through jacobi identities generates extra symmetries i.e. the secondary,
ternary ... generators. the generators li
n with n > 0 and i a simple root are called the
fundamental generators (or primary) of v (g) in the sense that all the others can be obtained
from them by taking commutators. the primary generator l
n is associated to the root n.
calculating secondary, ternary, ... generators through jacobi identities induces generators
n, l
m]
is n + m. the lie algebra v (g) is clearly not a kac-moody algebra, but according to

associated to a root p nii. for instance if  +   , the root associated to [l

15

kac classication of lie algebras [25], v (g) is an innite dimensional lie algebra with a
non-polynomial degeneracy of the roots. let us stress again that, in such diagrams, the
cartan sub-algebra is at the origine of the diagram, and the bracket between two generators
is dened only between generators on the same circle, or the same radius.

the decomposition

v =dli

0 : i = 1,    , re dl

n :   +, n > 0e dl

n :   +, n > 0e

(4.27)

should be thought of as a decomposition of v into a cartan sub-algebra and positive
and negative root spaces. from this point of view, one expects to be able to construct
from linear forms on the cartan sub-algebra
representations of v (g) from weights, i.e.
: i =

dli
1,    , re) is a weight then u(cid:16)v (g)(cid:17)/i is a representation of v (g) where i is the two-sided
ideal in u(cid:16)v (g)(cid:17) generated by the li

(4.28)

4.3 examples for so(6)

the verma module construction in the previous sub-section gives many examples of f lie
algebras. however, the representations of v (g) obtained are all highest weight representa-
tions. in this section, in the spirit of section 4.1, we will construct explicitly non-highest
weight representations of v (so(6)) and the corresponding f lie algebras.

first of all, we introduce h1, h2, h3 the generators of the cartan sub-algebra. we denote
ei the eigenvalues of hi, and  = {1 = e1  e2, 2 = e2  e3, 3 = e2 + e3, 1 = e1 + e2,
2 = e1  e3, 3 = e1 + e3} the positive roots, where 1, 2 and 3 are the simple roots. then

we introduce the six sl(2) : ne, .h,

roots are then generated by

2 ,   o. the three sl(2) associated to the primitive

sl(2)1 : ne1, 1
sl(2)1 : ne2, 1
sl(2)3 : ne3, 1

2 (h1  h2)o
2 (h2  h3)o
2 (h2 + h3)o.

(4.29)

secondly, we need to understand, using the results of section 4.1, how one can extend
the representations (3.3) of so(1, 2) to representations (4.15) of vir. for that purpose, we
introduce commuting variables belonging to the so(1, 2) representation:

16

 if the representation is a spin-s representation we dene {xs,    , xs} = ds;

 for innite dimensional representation bounded from below/above we consider d

 =

{xp, p  (in  )}.

next, using the results of section 4.1, we can extend any representations d of so(1, 2) to

a representation d of the virasoro algebra. explicitly:

 for ds, one can easily observe that xns, for any positive n when s integer and for
odd positive n when s half-integer, is a primitive vector for the sl(2) sub-algebra
spanned by {ln/n, l0/n} so dn
representation;

s = nxns, x(n1)s,    , xnso is isomorphic to a ds

 in the case of innite dimensional representations we have similar results if  is a
rational number. in the case of interest  = 1/f , we have primitive vector only when
n = (pf + 1).

to conclude with the construction of the representation of vir, we just have to introduce

p the conjugate momentum of xk, [p, xk] = k)

 for ds = {xn, n  zz + s} the generators of the virasoro algebra are ln = pkzz

m)xn+mpm;

(ns 

 and for d

 = {xp, p  zz  }: ln = pkzz

(n  k)xn+kpk.

in conformal eld theory these expressions for the generators of the virasoro algebra
are known [26]. the ln are the modes of the stress-energy tensor (for the conformal or
superconformal ghosts) associated to conjugate conformal elds of conformal weight 1 + 
(the xs) and  (the ps) but it is important to emphasize that in contrast with the
case of conformal eld theory, here we do not have any normal ordering prescription and
consequently no central charge.

the spin representation of so(6)

the spinorial representation of chirality + is obtained from the dominant weight + = (3) =

the whole representation

2(e1 + e2 + e3) and the highest weight state is (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(in |a1, a2, a3i , ai is the eigenvalue of hi).

now, it is easy to see that with respect to the three sl(2) (noted sl(2)i) we have three

spinorial representations (for each sl(2)i, we have (cid:16)d1/2(cid:17)i

now, having introduced these variables, we can straightforwardly write the generators asso-
ciated to the three sl(2). for sl(2)i, we have (at this point we already take the normalizations

in other words, we need to extend the j (i)

(4.35)

this specied the d+ representation. the remaining commutators of v (so(6)) can then

be calculated explicitly.

the vector representation

for the vector representation the dominant weight is v = (1) = e1. to construct dv from
dv , we proceed along the same lines as for the spin representation, so we will be less explicit
in our construction. constructing dv , we have for each sl(2)i the following decomposition

dv  (cid:16)d1/2(cid:17) (cid:16)d

1/2(cid:17). we dene highest weights associated to the three sl(2) generated

0 /n) with n = 2p + 1. this induce a vector representation dp

 /n, l(i))

by (l(i)

v:

dp

v = {|(2p + 1), 0, 0i , |0, (2p + 1), 0i , |0, 0  (2p + 1)i} .

(4.36)

we then identify six spinorial representations of the primitive sl(2):

1/2(cid:17)1
sl(2)1 : (cid:16)dp
1/2(cid:17)1
(cid:16)dp

5 conclusion

supersymmetry is a well established mathematical structure (zz2 graded algebras) and be-
yond its purely formal aspects it has found a wide range of applications in eld theories and

20

particle physics. in this article, we have dened a mathematical structure generalizing the
concept of super-lie algebras (f lie algebras). these algebras seems to be appropriate if
one wants to generalize supersymmetry in the sense of f throots of representations.
in-
deed, we have shown that, within the framework of f lie algebras, it is possible to take
the f throot of any representation of any (complex semi-simple) lie algebra. in addition,
f lie algebras naturally lead to the innite dimensional lie algebra v (g) containing g as a
sub-algebra. for the special case g = sl(2, ir ), v (g) is the centerless virasoro algebra. as a
consequence, one may wonder whether or not central extensions of v (g) exist. furthermore,
one has a geometrical interpretation of the virasoro algebra (as vector elds on the circle)
so is there a similar interpretation for v (g) ?

unitary representations of fsusy, for g = so(1, 2) have also been constructed. it has
also been checked that it is a symmetry acting on relativistic anyons [12]. in the same way,
since the lorentz group in higher dimensions is just so(1, d  1), what is the interpretation
of fsusy for g = so(1, d  1) when the f lie algebra induces the f root of the spin or
the vector representations ?
