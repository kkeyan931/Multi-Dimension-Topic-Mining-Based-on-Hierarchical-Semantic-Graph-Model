abstract

z2-graded schwinger terms for neutral particles in 1 and 3 space

dimensions are considered.

introduction

in this paper we consider the canonical commutation relations (ccr) algebra
and the canonical anticommutation relations (car) algebra. to some extent
it is possible to treat the two algebras in parallel. this has been done in several
places. close to our spirit is [1]. in this reference the ccr and the car algebra
are generalized to a superalgebra  the canonical supercommutation relations
(csr) algebra, which describes charged particles in a z2-graded fashion.
related to these algebras is the concept of schwinger terms [2, 3].

it is
cocycles that arises when trying to implement bogoliubov transformations in
a physically important representation. they have been obtained for the ccr
algebra in [4], for the car algebra in [5] and for the csr algebra in [1],
for example. schwinger terms for neutral bosons and fermions have been is
calculated in [6].

what lacks is a calculation of a z2-graded schwinger term for neutral par-
in section (3) we perform such a calculation on an abstract basis by
ticles.
deriving (in section (2)) a z2-graded generalization of the fact [7] the car
algebra is -isomorphic with the self-dual canonical anticommutation relations
(sdc) algebra, used to describe neutral particles. finite bogoliubov trans-
formations are considered in section (4). in section (5), a physical realization
is made which allows concrete computations of z2-graded schwinger term for
neutral particles in odd dimensional space. explicit results are given for 1 and
3 space dimensions. finally, in section (6), the formalism is extended to include
grassmann numbers.

2 the ssr and csr algebra

assume that the boson space h0 and the fermion space h1 are complex, innite
dimensional, separable hilbert spaces. we will in general be interested in the
z2-graded space h = h0  h1. its scalar product will be denoted by (, ). let
j be a conjugation in h (an antilinear norm-preserving operator whose square
is the identity) that is even (i.e.
it is commuting with the klein operator
 = p0  p1, where  = p0  p1 and p,  = 0, 1, denotes the orthogonal
projection onto h). let p be an even orthogonal projection operator that
satises jp = (1  p )j. the physical interpretation we have in mind is
that particles are described by vectors in p h and anti-particles by vectors in
(1  p )h. since the algebraic relations for creation and annihilation operators
dier between bosons and fermions, it is useful to introduce the operator q =
p  (1  p ). in terms of it, these relations (considered in [6]) can be extended
to

b(c1f1 + c2f2) = c1b(f1) + c2b(f2)

b(f ) = b(qf )

(cid:2)b(f1), b(f2)(cid:3)s = (f1, f2) 1

b(f ) = b(qjf )

with

deg(b(f )) = deg(f ),

where the supercommutator has been used (basic denitions concerning super
algebras can be found in the appendix). the asterix denotes the adjoint opera-
tion in h. replacing the last equation in (1) with the fact that the commutator
of two b operators vanish gives the well known relations for the generators of
the csr algebra (which will be dened below for the half-space p h). our
choice of the last equation in (1) relates the creation of a particle (anti-particle)
with the annihilation of a corresponding anti-particle (particle). this means
that (1) describes neutral particles, see [9]. we dene the self-dual canonical
super commutator relations (ssr) algebra assr over h to be the complex -
algebra generated by an identity 1 and the symbols b(f ), b(f ); f  h, obeying
the relations generated by (1). the reason for referring to b(f ) and b(f ) as
symbols is that we have not yet given any representation of assr in terms of
which they can be interpreted as creation and annihilation operators. to nd
such a representation, we set h = p h (we could equally well have dened h to
be (1p )h since any two complex innite dimensional separable hilbert spaces
are isomorphic) and dene the canonical super commutation relations (csr)
algebra acsr over h to be the complex -algebra generated by an identity 1
and the symbols a( f ), a( f ); f  h, obeying the relations generated by

a(c1 f1 + c2 f2) = c1a( f1) + c2a( f2)

a( f ) = a( f )

ha( f1), a( f2)is
ha( f1), a( f2)is

= (cid:16) f1, f2(cid:17) 1

= 0

deg(a( f )) = deg( f ).

with

(3)

(4)

this is recognized as the algebra that describes charged bosons and fermions
when considered as vectors in h. since it has been considered earlier in the
literature [1] we can nd useful information about assr if it can be related to
acsr. in fact, the following lemma holds:

lemma 1 assr and acsr are -isomorphic

proof dene a mapping  by

(cid:0)b (f )(cid:1) = a(p f )  a(j(1  p )f )

(5)

it is then straight forward to check that  can be extended to a -isomorphism.

we will now consider a representation of the algebra in (3) called the fock-
cook representation [1]. the representation space is the fock space f(h) =
fb(h0)  ff (h1), h := ph, with the naturally induced z2-structure.
in
terms of the bosonic and fermionic creation and annihilation operators (in the
fock-cook representation), the representation is given by:

a( f )  (cid:16)a( f )(cid:17) = a

b(p0

f )  11 + 10  a

f (p1

f )

(6)

and a( f ) = a( f ). the vacuum |>= |b>  |f > is the vector character-
ized by a( f )|>= 0,  f  h. through lemma 1 this construction provides us
with a (physically interesting) representation of (1) according to

b(f ) = a(p f )  a(j(1  p )f )
b(f ) = a(p f ) + a(j(1  p )f ),

(7)

see [6] for the corresponding ungraded representation.

implementation and schwinger terms

the implementation problem for the representation in (7) will now be consid-
ered. we will prove a corresponding theorem to the one proved by shale [10]
(for charged bosons) and by shale and stinespring [11] (for charged fermions).
however, the language of ruijsenaars [9] will be used.

consider a bounded operator x on h having the form

x =



xn=1

n fn(gn, )

(8)

with { fn}
numbers. the operator

n=1, {gn}

n=1 orthonormal systems in h and {n}

n=1 a set of complex

xaa =



xn=1

na( fn)a(gn)

(9)

is well dened on the dense subspace d(h)  f(h) dened as the linear span
of elements

a( f1)a( f2)...a( fn0)|> n0  n, fn  h

(10)

where the multiplication of the creation operators is either the symmetric or
antisymmetric exterior product depending on the degree of the vectors under
consideration. for a given conjugation j on h we dene

xaa =

xaa =



xn=1
xn=1



na( fn)a( j gn)

na( j fn)a(gn).

(11)

the following lemma was proven in [1]:

lemma 2 let x be a bounded operator on h. the necessary and sucient
condition for the operators xaa and xaa to be well dened on d(h) is that
x is a hilbert-schmidt operator.

consider then bounded operators x on h of form

x =



xn=1

nfn(gn, ),

(12)

n=1 and {gn}

where {fn}
n=1 is a
set of complex numbers. for a moment, we will restrict to the case when x is
an operator such that

n=1 are orthonormal systems in h and {n}

1
2



xn=1

n b(fn) b(gn)

(13)

exists as an operator on d(h) and has nite vacuum expectation value. this
is equivalent with the fact that x is a trace class operator. the operator d()

is dened by

d(x) = :

xn=1

n b(fn) b(gn) :,

(14)

where :
vacuum expectation value. it follows that

: denotes normal ordering dened as the argument subtracted by its

where

d(x) = d(qj(x)qj),

nfn(gn, )) =



xn=1

(1)<fn,gn>nfn(gn, )

(15)

(16)

(



xn=1

and < fn, gn >:= deg(fn)  deg(gn) (see appendix).
it is important to note
that the last relation in (1) was necessary for the derivation of (15). thus, no
corresponding relation exist for charged particles. from now on, we will only
consider operators x fullling the so-called self-duality condition [12]:

x = qj(x)qj.

(17)

inserting (7) in (14) gives then:

d(x) = (p xp )aa +

(p xj jp )aa

(p jjxp )aa,

(18)

where the relation

xn=1

na(p jfn)a(p jgn) :

(19)

has been used. with this alternative form it is possible to extend the domain of
d(). for this, we introduce the semi-group g2 of bounded self-dual operators
x such that p x(1  p ) and (1  p )xp are hilbert-schmidt.

proposition 1 let x be a bounded self-dual operator on h. the necessary
and sucient condition for d(x) in (18) to be well dened on d(h) is that
x  g2. further, for x, y  g2,

h d(x), b(f )is

= b(xf )

h d(x), d(y )is

= d([x, y ]s)

c(x, y )1,

c(x, y ) = str(cid:0)(1  p )xp y  (1)<x,y >(1  p )y p x(cid:1)

(20)

(21)

(22)

6

where str() = tr() and tr is the hilbert space trace on h.

d(x) is well dened if and only if all operators on the right hand
proof
side are well dened. for the rst term this is clear. according to lemma 1,
the necessary and sucient condition for the last two to be well dened is that
p xj jp and p jjxp are hilbert-schmidt. the rst part of the proposition
follows now from the fact that the algebra of hilbert-schmidt operators is an
ideal in the set of bounded operators, see for example [13]. by use of eq. (3),
(7) and (18), it is straight forward to verify eq. (20). the calculations are
simple but long and will therefore be omitted. similar, the relation in (21) can
be proved by use of eq. (3) and (18). the schwinger term can be obtained by
observing that the rst term on the right hand side of eq. (21) has vanishing
vacuum expectation value. it implies:

c(x, y ) = 2 <|h d(x), d(y )is

|>,

(23)

from which eq. (22) can be proven. again, the long, but simple computations
will be omitted.

notice that the schwinger term that arises in eq. (22) is precisely one half of
the corresponding term for charged particles. another important distingtion
from the charged particle case is that proposition 1 is only true for operators
satisfying the self-duality condition. in fact, eq. (15) implies that

d(x) =

1
2

d (x + qj(x)qj)

leading to

h d(x), b(f )is

= b(cid:18) 1

2

(x + qj(x)qj) f(cid:19)

(24)

(25)

which is not equal to b(xf ) unless x is self-dual. a similar argument can be
made regarding eq. (21) and (22).

by representing the neutral creation and annihilation operators in terms
of the corresponding operators for charged particles, eq. (7), the question of
the extension to unbounded operators of the results in this section is easy to
answer.
in fact, it is in complete analogy with the corresponding extension
for charged particles, considered in [1]. the results in the next section and in
section (6) can be extended to unbounded operators in the same way.

4 bogoliubov transformations

the necessary and sucient condition for an even operator u on h to induce
an automorphism u of assr such that

u (b(f )) = b(u f )

(26)

7

is that u preserves the relations in (1), or equivalently, that u commutes
with j and fullls qu qu  = 1. we refer to the induced transformation as a
bogoliubov transformation. further, u is said to be unitary implementable
(in the representation under consideration) if there exists a unitary operator
(u ) such that

(u )b(f )(u ) = b(u f )

(27)

it is known [6] that this is equivalent with the condition that (1  p )u p and
p u (1  p ) should be hilbert-schmidt operators. the following proposition
was proved for the charged particle case in ref. [1].

proposition 2 let x  g2 be an even operator satisfying x  = qxq. then

eit d(x)b(f )eit d(x) = b(eitx f )

eit d(x) d(y )eit d(x) = d(eitx y eitx ) 

1
2

b(tx, y )

holds on d(h) for t  r, f  h, y  g2, where

b(x, y ) = iz 1

0

ds c(x, eisx y eisx ).

(28)

(29)

(30)

further, if y  g2 is even and fullls y  = qy q then the following relation
holds on d(h):

eit d(x)eit d(y )eit d(x) = ei 1

2 b(x,y )eit d(itx y eitx ).

[a, [a, ...[a,

b]...]]

together with (20), (21) and (22), the rst three equations are easily seen to
be true. the last relation is obtained by exponentiation of (29) for t = 1.

from the relation

d(x) = d(qx q), x  g2

(33)
it is seen that if x fullls x  = qxq then d(x) is self-adjoint and ei d(x) is
unitary. thus, for x as in the proposition, the operator u = eitx denes a
unitary implementable bogoliubov transformation u .

8

5 a physical realization

we will now consider the case when h = l2(rd)  v , where the nite dimen-
sional z2-graded space v induces a natural grading in h by: h = l2(rd)v.
the schatten ideal b2p is dened as the set of bounded operators x such that
tr(x x)p is convergent, see [13] for instance. especially, b1 and b2 are the
trace class and hilbert-schmidt operators, respectively. the trace of a pseudo-
dierential operator (psdo) that is trace class can be calculated as:

tr(x) =

1

(2)d z ddxddq trv (x)(q, x),

(34)

where trv is the trace on v and (x) denotes the symbol of x as a psdo,
see [14] for the basic properties of psdos. from this formula it follows that a
psdo with compact support in conguration space is in b2p if and only if its
symbol is of order less than d/2p.

assume that the decomposition h = p h  (1  p )h is determined by the
sign  of the hamiltonian so that  = 1 on p h and  = 1 on (1  p )h. on
the space of eigenvectors belonging to the zero eigenvalue, we dene  to be
1. the condition that a bounded self-dual operator x is in g2 can then be
written as [, x]  b2. we will from now on only consider the case when x
represents an innitesimal gauge transformation. we therefore assume that it
is a multiplication operator: xf (x) = x(x)f (x), that has compact support in
the conguration space and commutes with the gamma matrices. this implies
that x and  are psdo of order 0 that commutes to highest order. thus, their
commutator is a psdo of order 1 and [, x]  bd+1. therefore, x  g2 is
only true for d = 1. this corresponds to the fact that the current d(x) is
only well dened in 1 space dimension. in higher dimensions, an additional
renormalization, apart from the normal ordering, has to be performed. this is
in complete analogy with the case for charged particles.

we will now also take into account that the implementer of an innitesimal
gauge transformation is in fact not given by the current, but rather by the
gauss law commutators

g(x, ) = d(x) + lx ,

(35)

if we restrict to the consider x  g2. the lie derivative lx acts on functionals
m() as

(lx m)() =

d
dt

m ( + t [, x])|t=0 .

(36)

in parallel with the charged particle case, it can be shown that up to cobound-
aries (this concept will soon be explained), eq.
(22) is still true in 1 space
dimension if d(x) is replaced with g(x, ). in fact, it can even be replaced
with g(x, 0), where the current d(x, 0) is dened as in (18) but with p
replaced with the orthogonal projection p0 belonging to the sign of the free

9

hamiltonian 0. this is equivalent will the well-known fact (at least for charged
particles) that the 1-dimensional schwinger term does not depend on the gauge
potential. the dierence between d(x) and g(x, ) becomes apparent rst
in higher dimensions. the basic ideas are the same for all odd dimensions  3
so we restrict to only consider the case for d = 3. as in [15], the physically
important implementer in higher dimensions is given by

g(x, ) := u ()g(x, 0)u().

(37)

the unitary operator u() acting on f(h) is by denition the operator which
maps the vacuum vector in the fock space determined by  to the vacuum
vector in the fock space determined by 0. thus, u() is only well dened for
 such that   0  b2.
if x  g2, then the same is true for g(x, ) and
g(x, ). to circumvent the problem of restriction of x and , we consider
the second quantized operators in (37) as sesquilinear forms [16] and introduce
a renormalized commutator as in [17]. this in analog with the situation for
charged particles and allows a parallel treatment to ref.
it gives the
3-dimensional schwinger term:

[15].

c(x, y ; ) = 

1
16

str(cid:16)(  0)20h [0, x] , [0, y ]i(cid:17) .

(38)

it can be shown that   0  b4 for d = 3 and this, together with the fact
that [0, x]  b4, implies that the right hand side is well dened. for the case
d = 1 the schwinger term in eq. (22) can be rewritten in terms of 0 according
to:

c(x, y ; 0) = 

str (0 [0, x] [0, y ]) .

(39)

1
4

from eq. (38) and (39), local forms of the schwinger terms can be calculated
as in ref. [15].

finally, we would like to mention the cohomological meaning of the schwinger
term. a coboundary is the change in the schwinger term if adding a function
 = (x, ) to g(x, ), namely:

()(x, y ) = ([x, y ])  lx (y ) + (1)<x,y >ly (x).

(40)

the dening equation for the schwinger term implies that it has to satisfy:

c([x, y ], z; )  lx c(y, z; ) + graded cyclic perm. = 0,

(41)

the so-called cocycle relation. if restricting to local expressions, then the set
of cocycles modular the set of coboundaries denes the physically important
cohomology for the schwinger term.

including grassmann numbers

in this section we extend the formalism to contain grassmann numbers. the
motivation for this is to make the formalism compatible with supersymmetric
quantum mechanics models, as the one considered in [18]. for notations and
basic denitions, see the appendix.

we use the notation bn for the associative and commutative - superalge-
i , deg(i) = 1. bn is 2n -dimensional
bra over c generated by {i}n
and can be equipped with a homogeneous basis {}2n 1
=1 . the (left) bn -
module bn  h is by denition the linear space spanned by the elements
f =  c f, f  h. for convenience, the symbol for the tensorproduct
will often be omitted. we dene the grading according to

i=1, i = 

deg(f) = deg() + deg(f)

(42)

and we extend the inner product in h to a product in bn  h according to

(f1,, f2,) = (1)<+ ,f1,>

(f1,, f2,).

it carries a left action of bn according to

 (f) = ()f.

and a right action according to

(f) = (1)< ,+f1,>( )f.

(43)

(44)

(45)

of interest is also the -superalgebra bn  a, for a a complex involutive
superalgebra. it is the algebra generated by the elements a =  c a, a 
a. the algebraic product is dened by

( c a1,)( c a2,) = (1)< ,a1,> c (a1,a2,),

(46)

the grading by

and the involution by

deg(a) = deg() + deg(a)

(a) = (1)<,a>

a
.

(47)

(48)

furthermore, in the case of a  a(h), the set of linear operators on h, we
dene an action of bn  a on bn  h according to

( c a)  ( c f) = (1)< ,a> c (af).

(49)

this implies

(f1, af2) = (af1, f2).

(50)

11

the trace trbn a on bn  a  bn  a(h) is the linear operator dened by

trbn a(a) = tra(a).

(51)

now, the structure of the formalism developed in the earlier sections is close
to the one that is obtained by including grassmann numbers. we will go
through the basic denitions and point out where things dier when grassmann
numbers are included.

bn c assr is generated by the operators b(f)  b(f), b(f)
b(f) and an identity. the corresponding relations of (1) are

 (1)<,f>
fullled except for the last which is replaced by

b(f ) = b(qjkf ),

where f is a linear combination of elements f and k is dened by

kf = (1)<,f>

f.

(52)

(53)

similar, bn c acsr is generated by the operators a( f)  a( f),
a( f)  (1)<, f>
a( f) and an identity. they obey the corresponding
relations of (3). the -isomorphism is dened as in (5), but with j replaced
by the non-antiunitary operator jk.

using the representations of acsr dened in section (2) we may follow
the recipe of (49) to dene a corresponding representation of bn c acsr in
bn  f(h). as before, this provides us with a representation of bn c assr.
the dening equation is (7) with j replaced by jk. it is now straight forward
to check that everything said in section (3) goes through provided we replace
every space with bn tensored with it and make the substitution j  jk.
the results of section (4) can be extended in a similar way, see [1] for the
corresponding case for charged particles.

appendix: super algebras and super vector
spaces

some basic facts about z2-graded vector spaces and algebras will be summa-
rized here. an element v in a z2-graded vector space v = v0  v1 is said to be
homogeneous of degree , deg(v) = , if v  v,   z2  {0, 1}. if v is also
an algebra with grading preserving multiplication, i.e. v  v, w  v  vw 

12

v+ , then it is called a z2-graded algebra. we dene the supercommutator
[, ]s : v  v  v by

[v, w]s = vw  (1)<v,w>wv.

(54)

where the notation < v, w > means deg(v)  deg(w). this denition is by
linearity also well dened for non-homogeneous elements. equipped with the
supercommutator, v becomes a lie superalgebra. every linear operator x on
v can be written in matrix form

x10 x11 (cid:19)
x = (cid:18) x00 x01

(55)

corresponding to the decomposition v = v0  v1. then deg(x) =  + 
denes a grading which provides every algebra of linear operators on v with a
z2-structure.
