abstract

when the theory of quantum chromodynamics was introduced, it was to explain
the observed phenomena of quark connement and scaling. it was then discovered
that the emergence of instantons is an essential consequence of this theory. this
led to unanticipated explanations not only for the anomalously high masses of
the  and the  particles, but also for the remarkable dierences that have been
observed in the mixing angles for the pseudoscalar mesons and the vector mesons.

1

1. introduction.

the discovery of the eightfold way 1 in 1961 implied that all observed mesons could
be placed in 8 or 1 representations of the group su (3) , which later became 2 the avor
group su (3)avor , with the quarks u , d and s forming the fundamental 3 representation.
it was clear, however, that su (3)avor is broken, and consequently, mixing should take
place between the eighth members of the octets and singlet states. later in the sixties, this
became a hot topic, when it appeared that this mixing for the pseudoscalar mesons is very
dierent from what happens with the vector mesons. in terms of their quark components,
we write the mesonic wave functions |1i and |2i as

|1i = cos (cid:18) uu + d d  2ss
|2i =  sin (cid:18) uu + d d  2ss
6

(cid:19) + sin (cid:18) uu + d d + ss
(cid:19) ,
(cid:19) + cos (cid:18) uu + d d + ss
(cid:19) ,

great experimental eorts went into precisely determining these mixing angles. in-
deed, an experimental set-up, especially designed to study the radiative decays of vector
and pseudoscalar mesons, was designed and built at cern 3 . not only 4 the (  ) and
the (  ) mixings 5 were determined but also, by measuring its 2 decay 6 , a meson
that at that time was called the x 0 , could be identied as being the ninth pseudoscalar
meson; it was renamed  .

the outcome of these measurements was indeed remarkable. in the pseudoscalar case,

the mixing angle turned out to be

p s  10 ,

whereas the vector mesons mix with an angle

v  51 .

this gives

and

j p c = 0+ ( ( 550 mev)  .50 (uu + d d)  .70 (ss) ,
( 960 mev)  .49 (uu + d d) + .71 (ss) ,
j p c = 1 ( ( 780 mev)  .71 (uu + d d)  .06 (ss) ,
( 1020 mev)  .04 (uu + d d) + 1.00 (ss) ,

(1.2)

(1.5)

so we see that  and  are divided to a large extent as dictated by su (3) , whereas

 and  divide mainly in accordance with their quark composition.

these values for the mixing angles cannot be accidental, but should be explained.
many attempts were made to obtain some insights. then, in the early seventies, it was

2

realized that meson dynamics can be understood as being described by a non-abelian gauge
theory with gauge group su (3)c (the color group), and fermions in the fundamental 3
representation of this group (the quarks) 7 . since the input parameters of this theory,
now called quantum chromodynamics (qcd), appeared to consist only of the color
gauge coupling parameter g (or, equivalently, the parameter qcd ) and the quark masses
mf , the mixing angles should, in principle, be predictable. this, however, only added to
the mystery: why are pseudoscalar mesons so much dierent from the vectors?

actually, there were other, even more distressing problems associated to the pseu-
doscalars. the successes of low-energy current algebra considerations such as cvc (the
conserved isovector vector current) 8 and pcac (the partially conserved isovector ax-
ial vector current) 9 , strongly indicated that meson physics has an approximate chiral
su (2)  su (2) symmetry. the pions, with their anomalously low mass values, can then
be regarded as being the goldstone bosons associated with this symmetry. it is easy to in-
corporate this symmetry in the qcd lagrangian, simply by postulating that the u and the
d quarks must have very small mass terms here. the problem one then encounters is that,
if this were the case, qcd should actually have an even larger symmetry: u (2)  u (2) ,
which diers from the observed symmetries by an extra chiral u (1) component, and this
should be reected in a (partially) conserved isoscalar axial vector current, j a
 (x) . thus,
the symmetry held responsible for the relatively small value of the pion masses, should
necessarily induce another symmetry in the model that would strongly reduce the mass of
yet another particle: the pions should have had a pseudoscalar partner, somewhat like the
 , but composed predominantly of uu and d d quarks, in the combination (uu + d d)/2
(which we will refer to as the state o
o ). adding the strange quark s , should then only
result in having an extra pseudoscalar meson made of pure ss, and, since its mass would
be constrained by the same terms that produce the kaon mass (the strange quark mass
term), the ss pseudoscalar meson could not be much heavier than the kaon. it appeared
that the kaon mass times 2, or 700 mev , should be an upper limit.

in the early days, it was therefore suspected that qcd requires explicit correction
terms; after all, its ability to keep quarks permanently conned inside hadronic congura-
tions was also not yet explained. 10

surprisingly, no such correction terms are needed at all. both connement and the
absence of the chiral u (1) symmetry can now be adequately explained as being special
features of qcd alone. both are due to special topological aspects of the system. conne-
ment is due to the existence of color-magnetic charges that undergo bose condensation 11 ,
and the absence of chiral u (1) is due to instantons 12 .

 this result can easily be seen from the equations for the masses in the appendix, by substi-
tuting  = 0 and m = m in eqs (a.4)(a.6), realizing that b > 0 because of (a.9) and
(a.10). the limit is reached if f1  |f3  f1| .

2. instantons.

the rst topological structures in gauge theories were the abrikosov vortices in super-
conducting material. they can be viewed as soliton solutions in 2 space-dimensions. when
particle physicists 13 began thinking of quarks being held together by stringlike structures,
the stringlike nature of these vortices caught their attention. it was realised that all one
needs is an abelian higgs theory 14 , and the existence of such vortices is guaranteed.

when this vortex for the non-abelian case was examined more closely, it was found to
be unstable, and this implied the existence of other topologically stable objects, but in 3
rather than 2 dimensions. these 3-dimensional objects had to be magnetic monopoles 15 .
bose condensation of color-magnetic monopoles is now the favored explanation of quark
connement 11 .

this subsequently raised another question: are there topologically stable objects in
more than 3 dimensions? what about 4 dimensions, and what would their physical inter-
pretation be? a localised object in 4 dimensions describes an event rather than a particle,
and so we devised the name instanton for such objects 16 . the rst example in gauge
theory had been described by belavin et al 17 in 1975. in their paper, minkowski space
had been replaced by euclidean space. in this space, they found localised solutions of the
classical gauge eld equations. this raised questions such as: what kind of events do these
instantons correspond to, and why do they exist only in euclidean space?

euclidean spacetime is obtained upon analytic continuation of physical amplitudes
for imaginary time: we replace t by i x4 with now x4 a real coordinate. this is exactly
what one needs to do if one wishes to compute a tunnelling amplitude, replacing the usual
perturbation expansion by a bkw expansion. the exponential suppression factor in the
amplitude is obtained by solving the classical equations with time being replaced by an
imaginary parameter. therefore, instantons are to be interpreted as tunnelling events.
indeed, their contributions to physical amplitudes are proportional to exp(82/g2) , an
exponential suppression typical for tunnelling. but this is not all. the tunnelling event in
question violates a conservation law that would be respected by any ordinary perturbative
eect. which conservation law? belavin et al had noted in passing that their solution has

where f = 1
tively. but, according to adler 18 , and bell and jackiw 19 ,

2 f , and the sign refers to instantons and anti-instantons, respec-

j a

162 f a

 .

(2.2)

this is the well known axial triangle diagram anomaly. one-loop enormalisation eects
cause an apparently tiny (proportional to g2 ) violation of axial current conservation. we
observe that the instanton would give rise to a transition between states with dierent

values for the axial charge q5(t) =r d3x j a
q5 = q5(t )  q5(t ) =z t

note that, although the tunnelling amplitude is computed using analytic continuation to
euclidean time, the actual event takes place in minkowski space-time. being topological
equations, eqs. (2.1)  (2.3) hold both in euclidean and in minkowski space-time, since
they are independent of the metric g . this is why it is permitted to use the real charge
density j0(x, t) in eq. (2.3).

according to a theorem by adler 18 and bardeen 20 , the anomaly equation (2.2) is
essentially not aected by any renormalisation beyond the one-loop level. apparently, the
number 2 in eq. (2.3) will not be aected by higher order corrections. the meaning of
this is clear. one left-handed polarised quark (contributing +1 unit to the axial charge)
is turned into a right-handed one (with q5 = 1 ), or vice versa. it is important to note
that in a theory with nf quark avors, eq. (2.3) holds for each avor separately. in total,
one therefore has

q5 = 2nf .

(2.4)

there are several ways to understand, mathematically as well physically, why and how
such transitions take place 12 . here we will limit ourselves to the explanation that, in a
properly regularised and renormalised theory, the total number of dirac levels for fermions,
in a given volume, is precisely specied. the instanton causes exactly one such level to
make a transition from positive to negative energy, or vice-versa, thus crossing the fermi
level of the vacuum. this way, one quark with one helicity may be materialised from the
dirac sea, while another, with opposite helicity, submerges into this sea. more precise and
complete explanations have been given elsewhere 12, 21 .

not only instantons violate chiral u (1) invariance, but also the quark mass terms.
this implies that a new phase angle, inst , emerges in the description of interference
between these two symmetry breaking eects. in the early days of qcd, it had not been
realized that qcd possesses two fundamental parameters, the gauge coupling g and the
instanton angle inst . in the qcd lagrangian, the eect of this angle can be described by
adding a term

iinst 

g2
322 f f .

(2.5)

in perturbation expansion, this term seems to give no eect at all because it can be written
as a pure derivative:

f a

g2 k = (cid:0)2aa

(2.6)

)(cid:1) .

k is the chern-simons current. because of this equation, all feynman diagrams with
 , the sum of all external momenta, and hence
they vanish.
instantons nevertheless produce non-trivial physical eects depending on
inst , only because k is not gauge-invariant. since instantons are the only stable objects

this vertex in them carry a factor pi p(i)

 nor is there need to worry about the fact that g is a running coupling strength. in fact,
the elds f in eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) should be replaced by f = gf , so that g no longer
appears explicitly.

5

with a non-vanishing value of the integral (2.1), they are the only structures that can yield
inst -dependent eects.

3. instantons in qcd.

thus, instantons produce a new kind of interaction in all non-abelian gauge theories,
and in particular in qcd. it is known since 1976 that this interaction can be mimicked by
an eective interaction lagrangian of the form 16

linst(x) =  eiinst det { r(x)l(x)} + h.c. .

(3.1)

ra

here,  is a constant that should be in principle computable, and it contains the factor
e82/g2
. the subscripts l and r refer to the left- and right handed helicities, obtained
by means of the projection operators 1
2 (1  5) . the determinant is the determinant of
the matrix b
l , where a and b are avor indices only. the color indices and the dirac
spin indices can be arranged in several ways (this can be computed explicitly 16 ), but for
simplicity we will ignore these, since this eective lagrangian must be seen as active in an
eective hadron model, and we limit ourselves to colorless scalar and pseudoscalar mesons.
note that, in any case, vector mesons consist of quark-antiquark pairs that are either both
left-handed or both right handed, so that the determinant (3.1) will have no eect on
them (apart from higher orders). we see that the interaction (3.1) has exactly the right
quantum numbers for absorbing navor left helicity fermions and creating an equal number
of right handed ones (or vice-versa). in particular, the determinant is easily seen to be the
simplest possible interaction that conserves su (nf )  su (nf ) symmetry, while breaking
u (nf )  u (nf ) .

the cases nf = 0 and nf = 1 are rather special. if nf = 0 while inst 6= 0 , the
interaction (2.5), which is even under charge conjugation , but odd under parity, implies an
explicit p and cp violation. one can show 22 that the color-magnetic monopoles obtain
fractional electric charges, proportional to inst . this should have physically observable
eects. this is not a purely academic statement, because at very low energies, in qcd,
one may regard the up and down quarks as being heavy. if nf were equal to one, the
interaction (3.1) would blend with the quark mass term. in this case, no symmetry would
protect the single quark avor from getting a mass induced by qcd interactions.

of particular interest are qcd models with nf  2 . in this case, there is a global
chiral su (nf )su (nf ) symmetry that is not aected by instantons. in all such cases, the
eective interaction (3.1) would be non-renormalisable. this means that no perturbative
interaction of this sort may be admitted. the (non-perturbative) interaction shows up
only at low energies. indeed, at higher energies, one must substitute the running value of
g2 in , so that the eective strength of this coupling rapidly decreases with energy.

 the charge conjugation operator c replaces the gluon eld a by a , which is a non-
trivial transformation already in the pure su (3) gluon theory; for a purely gluonic su (2)c ,
nf = 0 theory, c would be indistinguishable from a gauge transformation, and therefore trivial.

6

studying the case nf = 2 gives us the physics of qcd if we allow ourselves to neglect
the eects of the strange quarks. in ref 12 , a low energy eective meson model for qcd
with instanton eects included is discussed at length. here, we summarise its results. the
eective meson elds ij basically correspond to the composite operators qrjqli , and
this 2  2 matrix is decomposed into eight real mesonic elds: a scalar isoscalar  , a
pseudoscalar isoscalar  , a scalar isovecor ~ , and a pseudoscalar isovector ~ . we write

where  1,2,3 are the pauli matrices. the interaction (3.1) now looks as

 = 1

2 ( + i) + 1

2 (~ + i~)  ~ ,

linst = u + u ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

u =  eiinst det (qrql) =  eiinst det  =  eiinst(cid:0)( + i)2  (~ + i~)2(cid:1) .

here, the parameter  diers from the  in (3.1) by some coecient. this is because,
in (3.1), the  elds were dened such that the kinetic terms in the lagrangian are
normalised to (d + mf ) , whereas in (3.3), we assume the kinetic terms for the mesons
to be normalised to tr  = 1

in ref 12 , it is explained that if the u and the d quark masses may be neglected then

2(cid:0)()2 + ()2 + (~)2 + (~)2(cid:1) .

inst will be aligned to zero, and the eective coupling goes as
linst  2(2 + ~2  2  ~2) .

(3.4)

now, since this is the only eect that splits the pion from the eta, and since the pion
continues to behave as a massless goldstone boson, one can deduce from (3.4) that the eta
mass becomes

m2

 = 8

(3.5)

(both ~ and  were already massive before the instantons were switched on, because of
u (2)  u (2) invariant potential terms in the unperturbed lagrangian, see ref 12 ). the
beauty of this simple analysis is that the instanton interaction bares exactly the quantum
numbers required for the eta mass termk . continuing the analysis furthermore shows that
the operator f f has the same quantum numbers as the eta eld, and so, one expects
a considerable mixture between the eta and pure gluonic matter.

although, in principle, not only the pseudoscalars, but also the vector mesons could
mix with gluonic matter, such a vector meson mixing is not directly associated to instan-
tons, as mentioned when discussing the eective instanton action (3.1).
in sect. 5, we
exlain why it is much weaker than for the pseudoscalars.

 a few signs here are chosen to be dierent from ref 12 .
k remember that we are still discussing the two-avor case, so the eects of the strange quarks

are ignored. therefore, eta here stands for the pseudoscalar state 0
 if one adds the third avor s here, this object will become a avor octet instead of a singlet
and hence not mix with glue but predominantly with ss , whereas the privilege to mix with
substantial amounts of pure glue will be reserved for the ninth pseudoscalar meson,  .

0 = 12

(uu + d d) .

7

the above, however, still ignored the presence of strange quarks. adding the strange

quark gives the eective interaction dimension 3 in terms of the mesonic elds:

det () = 112233     .

(3.6)

this does not have the quantum numbers of the mass terms of either the  or the 
particles. here, it is necessary to consider the consequences of chiral u (3) u (3) breaking
more carefully. as the su (3) case was not discussed in detail in ref 12 , we give a short
review here.

4. a discussion of the 3 avor case.

it is instructive to describe the scalar and the pseudoscalar mesons in terms of a simple
model. the model of ref 12 can extended to the nf = 3 case without any major changes.
the meson elds are written in the form of a matrix eld ij which, as before, is assumed to
have the quantum numbers of the quark-antiquark composite operator  qrj qli . under
a chiral ul  ur transformation, it transforms as

the lagrangian is taken to be

where

ij = u l

ikku rj .

l = tr   v () ,

v () = v0 + vm + vinst ;

v0 = 2tr   + a(tr  )2 + b tr (   ) ,
vm = 2mure 11  2mdre 22  2msre 33 ,
vinst = 2 re (eiinst det ) .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)
(4.4)
(4.5)

here, v0 has the complete u (3)  u (3) symmetry; vm represents the contributions of
the quark mass terms, breaking the symmetry down to u (2)  u (2) if mu and md are
small (note that, here, the parameters mu,d,s are proportional to the current quark mass
terms, but they do not carry the dimensions of a mass). vinst represents the instan-
ton contribution, which, having the form of a determinant, breaks the symmetry into
su (3)  su (3)  u (1)vector . the coecient  contains the standard exponential term
exp(82/g2) .

 the minus sign was chosen here so as to achieve hi > 0 while keeping the sign convention

for the mass terms of eq. (4.4).

 note that, in this term, g is a running coupling strenth. in an accurate analysis 16 , this
matches the non-trivial canonical dimension of this interaction. therefore, the exponential coef-
cient ends up to be of order one in units qcd .

8

the signs in the denition of ij and in eqs (4.3)(4.5), were chosen in such a way
that the vacuum expectation values will be positive. , a and b are parameters of the
model that must obey

2 > 0 ,

a + b > 0 ,

3a + b > 0 .

we take

(4.6)

where fi are the vacuum expectation values. imposing that the terms linear in the quan-
tum elds  cancel out, gives us the equations for the fi . if inst 6= 0 , these numbers in
general will be complex, and mixture occurs between the scalars and the pseudoscalars,
which makes the computations very lengthy.
in experimental observations the value of
inst is found to be very close to zero, or in other words, there is no observed mixing be-
tween scalars and pseudoscalars, since otherwise there would have been substantial parity
violation in the strong interactions. for simplicity, we will therefore now take inst to be
zero. redening

r = 2a(f 2

we get:

r + 2b f 2

(4.7)

(4.8)

and its permutations, replacing mu by md and ms .

just as in eq. (3.2), the real components are scalar elds, and the imaginary parts

are pseudoscalars. we will denote the scalars by s and the pseudoscalars as p .

it is now worth-while to compute the masses and mixing angles in this model. writing

which shows that, in the chiral limit ( mi = 0 ), where all fi are equal, only the ninth com-
ponent of the pseudoscalars gets a mass, which is proportional to the instanton coecient
. the scalar mesons s will always have masses due to the regular interactions (4.3).

substituting the angles that have been measured, eqs (1.4) and (1.5), and the masses

of 0 ,  and  , gives us the numbers fi and mi/fi :

mu/f1 + md/f2 = 2m 2

the  and the k masses are now computable. since the input parameters had
an exact isospin invariance,  are degenerate with the 0 , and k with k 0 . the k
mass-squared corresponds to the coecient in front of |p13|2 and |p23|2 in (4.10), which
is
(4.14)
and since all numbers in here were already determined by the  and  masses and mixing
angles, the outcome is predicted, yielding

(4.15)

no more than 3% away from the actual value. although this beautiful agreement with the
experimental value of the k mass may be accidental, this does indicate that the mechanism
for chiral symmetry breaking described here is realistic. in fact, this just conrms the long
known fact that the meson masses squared are approximately linearly proportional to the
quark masses.

it is probably even better to use the observed value for the kaon mass, 495 mev , to

estimate the strange quark mass term, ms . one then gets, instead of (4.13):

(4.16)

the scalar mesons in this model are fairly heavy. we found the scalar pion to be in the
range 1340 to 1580 mev , and the scalar kaon to be about 150 mev heavier than the scalar
pions. the masses and mixing angles of the scalar counterparts of  and  , here called
 and  , depend explicitly on the parameter a , which was not yet determined (see the
appendix for further details). we observe, that our rather crude model of eqs. (4.2)(4.5)
gives a quite realistic phenomenology for the pseudoscalar mesons.

10

5. a few words on   mixing and the c .

the model of sect. 4 is to be regarded as a low energy, eective theory. the scalar
resonances predicted in the region of 1340 to 1580 mev are expected to be quite wide.
their mass formulas are given in the appendix. from the way the masses depend on the
parameters a and b one deduces that the scalar masses are very much model dependent.
indeed, an alternative model can be constructed in which the elds  obey a non-linear
unitarity constraint:  = i . this model only contains pseudoscalars; the scalar masses
were sent to innity.

at high energies, qcd is more eectively described in terms of vortex dynamics; at
higher energies still, the asymptotic perturbation expansion of asymptotically free qcd is
the best. the question why  and  only mix rather weakly, and have nearly no gluon
content, can be explained in the high-energy limit. replacing these particles by the j/ ,
we can make the following observation.

whereas c couples to gluonic states via intermediate states with only two gluons,
it is well-known that j/ needs a 3-gluon intermediate state to decay. this means that,
in the limit mc   , j/ is coupled to gluonic matter much more weakly than c .
intermediate gluonic states are the only way in which a cc bound state can couple to other
avor states such as uu and d d . we see that j/ is shielded from these other states by
a factor strong relative to c . clearly then, j/ will not hardly mix as strongly to these
other states as c will do. if we now replace the charmed quark by the strange quark,
we may expect the same qualitative behaviour, although the precise numerical coecients
will be much harder to calculate. in any case, we should not be surprised to nd that the
vector state ss hardly mixes with uu and d d ; the reason for this is that the mixing goes
via an intermediate state of pure glue, and the coupling between the vector states and pure
glue is suppressed as compared to the pseudoscalar particles.

this argument must be added to the observation made at the beginning of sect. 3,
that the operator associated with the creation and absorption of vector mesons,  ,
contains either only left handed fermion-antifermion pairs or only right handed ones, and
therefore it does not match the quantum numbers of an eective instanton interaction (as
both the scalar and the pseudoscalar mesons do).

we now see that, in contrast, instantons give a fairly eective mixing between all

charmed sector, in particular in an approximation where we ignore the strange quark.

an alternative way to understand the two-avor model of sect. 3, and ref 12 , is
to integrate rst over all virtual strange-quark loops. a feynman diagram containing
the interaction (3.1), can then be seen to yield an amplitude proportional to a u (2)
determinant that does not contain the strange quarks, see fig. 1. in order to yield a non-
vanishing contribution, the strange quark, in its closed loop, must switch its helicity, but
this can happen due to the non-negligible value of the strange quark mass. indeed, the
eective instanton interaction is now proportional to ms . the case for more heavy avors
is a bit more subtle. primarily, the eect of an instanton will carry as a factor the product
of all heavy avor masses, ms  mc  mb   , but when they get heavier than qcd the

fig. 1. in the 2-avor case, the quantum numbers of the eective instanton interaction
exactly match the quantum numbers of a mass term for the quark combination o
o 
uu + d d . in the 3-avor case, there is an extra s-quark emitted and absorbed, with
opposite helicities. this gives a contribution to the o
o mass that is proportional to
the strange quark mass. then, because of the vacuum shift described by eq. (4.6),
this object mixes with ss and it becomes the physical  particle, which is close to
the su (3)avor octet state 8 = (1/6)(uu + d d  2ss) . the mass of the  
(1/3)(uu + d d + ss) is not limited by the strange quark mass, but arises as described
in sect. 4; i.e., its mass is proportional to the instanton action  .

heavy avors decouple, and the instanton behaves as if they were not there. this is why
eects due to charm, bottom and top are usually not considered. these heavy avors do
not mix very much with the light ones, be it via instantons or other forms of glue.

6. instantons and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.

there are various other aspects of qcd dynamics that are directly associated to
instantons. one of these is the nature of the dynamical forces that cause the sponta-
neous breakdown of chiral su (nf )  su (nf ) down to the vector avor symmetry group
su (nf ) . why should such a spontaneous symmetry breaking occur at all?

several hand-waving arguments can be brought forward. we see spontaneous sym-
metry breaking happen explicitly in some model calculations. in 1 + 1 dimensions, qcd
can be solved exactly in the nc   limit 23 . in this limit, we see the goldstone pions
emerge in the exact solution. they are also observed when qcd is solved on a lattice in
the large coupling limit 24 .

we would like to know whether qcd related theories can be constructed in which
chiral symmetry is not spontaneously broken, but realized explicitly in the wigner mode.
such a theory could be employed to describe a new strong interaction regime for the
weak interactions at ultra-high energies. it was attempted to construct a theory in which
the presently elementary leptons and quarks are seen as bound states of a new kind of
quarks at ultra-high energies. an ultra-strong color force should bind these new quarks.
such a theory, often referred to as technicolor 25 , however only works if some symmetry
protects the ordinary quarks and leptons against developing too large mass terms. this
symmetry can only be a chiral symmetry that is not spontaneously broken. the attempts
at constructing technicolor theories for the electro-weak forces were unsuccessful. the

12

demise of these theories was partly due to the following insight concerning qcd related
theories.

using a background of classical avor gauge elds, one can derive the anomalies in
the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitudes in given channels of these classical background elds 26 .
one does this by constructing instantons out of these background elds, and asking how
many axial charges are generated by it. the qcd lagrangian gives us explicit and exact
answers. we derive which of the chiral charges associated with the background gauge elds
are created or destroyed by these instantons, via the generalized version of eq. (2.4). now
consider some eective theory describing the mesonic and baryonic bound states. any
eective model for these hadrons should reproduce the same answers, i.e., the same chiral
charges q5 , with the same quantum numbers, should be produced by our background
instanton. this observation provides us with very strict constraints on the spectrum of
states that should be introduced in the eective meson model. if now the chiral avor
symmetry is not spontaneously broken, the total amount of axial avor charges involved in
the anomaly, as dictated by eq. (2.4), must be reproduced by the fermionic (mesonic and
baryonic) objects described in the eective model. this is called the anomaly matching
condition 26 .

explicit calculations then lead to a surprise:

if the symmetry were realized in the
wigner mode, one nds that, more often than not, the bound states carry too large
axial charges to allow us to match the anomalies using eq. (2.4). this would force us
to consider models in which the number of mesonic or baryonic species is fractional.
numbers such as 1/9 and 1/25 emerge in su (3)color and su (5)color theories, which would
be an absurdity. if however the eective degrees of freedom are assumed to realize the
external symmetries in the goldstone mode, then the constraints posed by the anomaly
matching condition can always be realized. thus we arrive at a contradiction if we assume
the chirally symmetric wigner mode to be realized in qcd. an exception is qcd with
exactly two avors. it is the strange quark that causes the rst real problem in constructing
a chirally symmetric spectrum. this leads one to conclude that, if chiral symmetry were
not already spontaneously broken in the up + down sector of the avor group, surely the
strange quark would trigger spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown.

thus the anomaly matching requirement rules out many attempts to use a qcd
related theory at the tev scale and assume it to realize its chiral symmetries in some
unconventional way

7. conclusion and remarks.

a simple polynomial lagrangian for the eective interactions between scalar and pseu-
doscalar mesons, with in addition the simplest polynomial that reects the correct quan-
tum numbers of an instantonic interaction, can reproduce the observed meson spectrum
quite reasonably. the fact that the pseudoscalars tend to mix along the dividing lines
of the su (3) octet and singlet representations, while the vectors  and  tend to mix
in such a way that pure avor bound states emerge, can be understood quite naturally.
the pseudoscalar mesons can be addressed in a simple model. in addition to pseudoscalar

13

mesons, this model contains also scalar mesons, but no vectors. if one wishes to include
vector mesons, one has to turn the eective model into an su (3)avor non-abelian, spon-
taneously broken gauge theory. such a model contains much more mesonic elds and freely
adustable parameters, and consequently it gives little further insight.

the experimental evidence that there is little pc violation in qcd indicates that
inst must be very small or zero. the sign of the instanton interactions (which is a free
parameter since one may freely choose inst ), is as indicated in the eective action term
(3.1) (note the minus signs in eqs. (4.2), (4.5) and in the denition  = qrql ), with
inst  0 .

within the paradigm of qcd, in the absence of weak interactions, it is not unnatural
to put inst = 0 , since only weak interactions, with their explicit cp violation eects by
having a phase angle in the kobayashi-maskawa matrix, can send inst away from zero.
note however that, by rotating the eld , one can transport the inst angle from the
instanton term (4.5) to one of the quark mass terms in eq. (4.4). since mu is the tiniest
mass term, it is most natural to put inst as a phase in the u quark mass term, which
then becomes re(eiinst mu11) . as mu runs towards smaller values at very high energy
scales, its phase will be aected by the weak interactions. as the tev scale is reached, it
becomes dicult to see why such eects should stay extremely small. from the observed
absence of scalar-pseudoscalar mixing one must deduce however that the inst is extremely
small. how this ne-tuning can be explained is as yet an unresolved problem. we suspect
that new physics at the tev scale must be responsible.

the question whether instantons also lead to observable eects at high energies is
more dicult to answer. at high energies, where the running coupling parameter gstrong
tends to become small, instantons are very eciently screened, as their amplitudes vary as
exp(82/g2
strong) , so we do not expect direct instanton eects at high energy. instantons
are very soft objects.

when the elds  are coupled to the electro-weak gauge eld via their currents (de-
ned by their weak transformation rules), we hit upon a serious shortcoming of this simple
model: it does not reproduce the experimentally well-conrmed i = 1/2 rule. indeed,
neutral kaons tend to decay only into charged pions; the 20 decay is suppressed! this
is because the gim mechanism prevents the decay through neutral vector bosons. this
deciency impedes attempts to investigate the / problem using models of this sort. to
reproduce the i = 1/2 rule one must take renormalization group eects in qcd into
account.

appendix a. mass formulae for scalar and pseudoscalar mesons.

the model of sect. 4 appears to generate fairly decent estimates for mesonic mass
relations. we here give some of the formulae. the derivations are straightforward. we
start from the eective action described by eqs. (4.2)  (4.5). the masses are determined by
eqs. (4.10). because of isospin symmetry, and because electromagnetism was ignored, we
keep mu = md , a number that in more rened theories should be replaced by 1
2 (mu +md) .
the two independent vacuum expectation values f1 and f3 are determined by eq. (4.8),
