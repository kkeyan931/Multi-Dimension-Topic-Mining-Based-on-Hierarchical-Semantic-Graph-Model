abstract

the qed renormalization is restudied by using a mass-dependent
subtraction which is performed at a time-like renormalization point.
the subtraction exactly respects necessary physical and mathematical
requirements such as the gauge symmetry, the lorentz- invariance and
the mathematical convergence. therefore, the renormalized results
derived in the subtraction scheme are faithful and have no ambiguity.
especially, it is proved that the solution of the renormalization group
equation satised by a renormalized wave function, propagator or ver-
tex can be xed by applying the renormalization boundary condition
and of the form as given in the feynman rules and, thus, an exact
s-matrix element can be expressed in the form as written in the tree
diagram approximation provided that the coupling constant and the
fermion mass are replaced by their eective ones. in the one-loop ap-
proximation, the eective coupling constant and the eective fermion
mass obtained by solving their renormalization group equations are
given in rigorous and explicit expressions which are suitable in the
whole range of distance. and exhibit physically reasonable asymptotic
behaviors.

1.introduction

in the renormalization of quantum eld theories, to extract nite physi-
cal results from higher order perturbative calculations, a certain subtraction
scheme is necessary to be used so as to remove the divergences occurring in
the calculations. there are various subtraction schemes in the literature, such
as the minimal subtraction (ms)1, the modied minimal subtraction (ms)
2, the momentum space subtraction (mom)3, the on-mass-shell subtraction
(os) 4,5, the o-mass shell subtraction (oms)6 and etc.. however, there
exists a serious ambiguity problem3,6.7 that dierent subtraction schemes in
general give dierent physical predictions, conicting the fact that the phys-
ical observables are independent of the subtraction scheme. ordinarily, it
was argued that the ambiguity appears only in nite order perturbative cal-
culations, while the exact result given by the whole perturbation series is
scheme- independent. since only nite order perturbative calculations are
able to be done in practice, one still expects to get unambiguous results from
such calculations. to resolve the ambiguity problem, several prescriptions,
such as the minimal sensitivity principle7, the eective charge method8 and
some others9 , were proposed in the past. by the principle of minimal sen-
sitivity, an additional condition has to be introduced and imposed on the
result calculated in a nite order perturbative approximation so as to ob-
tain an optimum approximant which is least sensitive to variations in the
unphysical parameters. in the eective charge method, the use of a coupling
constant is abandoned. instead, an eective charge is associated with each
physical quantity and used to determine the gell-mann-low function in
the renormalization group equation (rge). in this way, a renormalization-
scheme-invariant result can be found from the rge. in ref.(9), the authors
developed a new perturbation approach to renormalizable eld theories. this
approach is based on the observation that if the perturbation series of a quan-
tity r is not directly computable due to that the expansion coecients are
innite, the unambiguous result of the quantity can be found by solving

2

the dierential equation q dr(q)
dq = f (r(q)) where f(r) is well-dened and
can be expanded as a series of r. particularly, the nite coecients of the
expansion of f(r) are renormalization-scheme-independent and in one-to-
one correspondence with the ones in the ordinary perturbation series of the
r. the prescriptions mentioned above are somehow dierent from the con-
ventional perturbation theory in which the coupling constant is commonly
chosen to be the expansion parameter for a perturbation series.

in this paper, we wish to deal with the ambiguity problem from a dif-
ferent angle. it will be shown that the ambiguity problem can be directly
tackled in the conventional perturbation theory by the renormalization group
method1015. the advantage of this method is that the anomalous dimension
in a rge is well-dened although it is computed from a divergent renormal-
ization constant. in comparison of the renormalization group method with
the aforementioned approach proposed in ref.(9), we see, both of them are
much similar to one another in methodology. this suggests that the renor-
malization group method is also possible to yield the theoretical results which
are free from the ambiguity. the possibility relies on how to choose a good
subtraction scheme which give rise to such renormalization constants that
they lead to unique anomalous dimensions. the so-called good subtraction
scheme means that it must respect necessary physical and mathematical
requirements such as the gauge symmetry, the lorentz invariance and the
mathematical convergence principle. the necessity of these requirements is
clear. particularly, in the renormalization group approach to the renormal-
ization problem, the renormalization constants obtained from a subtraction
scheme not only serves to subtract the divergences, but also is directly used
to derive physical results. apparently, to guarantee the calculated results
are able to give faithful theoretical predictions, the subtraction procedure is
necessary to comply with the basic principles in physics and mathematics.
otherwise, the subtraction scheme should be discarded and thus the scheme-
ambiguity will be reduced. let us explain this viewpoint in some detail from
the following aspects: (1) for a gauge eld theory, as one knows, the gauge-
invariance is embodied in the ward identity. this identity is a fundamental
constraint for the theory. therefore, a subtraction scheme, if it is applicable,
could not defy this identity. as will be demonstrated in latter sections, the
ward identity not only establishes exact relations between renormalization
constants, but also determines the functional structure of renormalization
constants. (2)the lorentz-invariance results in the energy-momentum con-

3

servation which holds at every vertex. since the renormalization point in
the renormalization constants will be eventually transformed to the momen-
tum in the solutions of rges, obviously, in order to get correct functional
relations of the solutions with the momentum, the energy-momentum con-
servation could not be violated by the subtraction of vertices. (3) the renor-
malization constants in their original appearance are divergent. however,
such divergent quantities, according to the mathematical principle, have no
denition and hence are not calculable. therefore, we are not permitted to
apply any computational rule including the limit procedure to this kind of
quantities to perform a meaningful calculation. the meaningful calculation
can only be done for the regularized form of renormalization constants which
are derived from corresponding regularized feynman integrals. the necessity
of introducing the regularization procedure in the quantum eld theory may
easily be seen from the mathematical viewpoint as illustrated in appendix
a. for a gauge eld theory, the regularization scheme usually is required to
maintain the gauge-symmetry of the theory. in this case, the ward identity
still holds for the related quantities given in the regularized form. based on
the above arguments, we are not allowed to employ the divergent renormal-
ization constants to do any calculation because the divergent renormalization
constants, which are usually obtained from the regularized renormalization
constants by taking the limit for the regularization parameter, are not well-
dened. in the renormalization group formalism, therefore, the correct pro-
cedure of computing anomalous dimensions is starting from the regularized
form of renormalization constants. the limit operation taken for the regular-
ization parameter should be performed after the dierentiation with respect
to the renormalization point. since the anomalous dimensions are conver-
gent, the limit is meaningful and gives denite results. according to the
procedure stated above, as will be shown in the subsequent sections, the un-
physical factors or/and terms included in the regularized form of the renor-
malization constant could not contribute to the anomalous dimension and
the solution of rge. (4) in comparison with the other subtraction schemes,
the mom scheme appears to be more suitable for the renormalization-group
calculation. this is because this scheme naturally provides not only a renor-
malization point which is needed for the renormalization-group calculations,
but also a renormalization boundary condition for a renormalized quantity
(a wave function, a vertex or a propagator), which will be used to x the
solution of the rge for the quantity.

4

based on the essential points of view stated above, it may be found that
a renormalized quantity can be unambiguously determined by its rge and
thus a renormalized s-matrix element can be given in an unique form with-
out any ambiguity. to illustrate this point, we limit ourselves in this paper
to take the qed renormalization as an example to show how the ambiguity
can be eliminated. as one knows, the qed renormalization has been ex-
tensively investigated by employing the os, ms and mom schemes in the
previous works46,1026. but, most of these studies are concentrated on the
large momentum (short distance) behaviors of some quantities for the sake
of simplicity of the calculation. in this paper, we restudy the qed renormal-
ization with the following features: (1) the renormalization is performed in
a mass-dependent scheme other than in the mass-independent scheme which
was adopted in many previous works2026. the mass-dependent scheme obvi-
ously is more suitable for the case that the mass of a charged fermion can not
be set to be zero; (2) the subtraction is carried out in such a mom scheme
that the renormalization point is mainly taken to be an arbitrary time-like
momentum other than a space-like momentum as chosen in the conventional
mom scheme. the time-like mom scheme actually is a generalized mass-
shell scheme (gms). the prominent advantage of the gms scheme is that
it naturally connects the scale of renormalization point with the scale of mo-
menta and can directly be converted to the results given by the os-scheme ;
(3) the subtraction is implemented by fully respecting the necessary physical
and mathematical principles mentioned before . therefore, the results ob-
tained are faithful and free of ambiguity; (4) the eective coupling constant
and the eective fermion mass obtained in the one-loop approximation are
given exact and explicit expressions which were never found in the literature.
these expressions exhibit physically reasonable infrared and ultraviolet be-
haviors. we will pay main attention to the infrared (large distance) behavior
because this behavior is more sensitive to identify whether a subtraction is
suitable or not for the qed renormalization.

the rest of this paper is arranged as follows.

in sect.2, we sketch
the rge and its solution and show how a s-matrix element can be free
of ambiguity.
in sect.3, we briey discuss the ward identity and give a
derivation of the subtraction version of the fermion self-energy in the gms
scheme.
in sect.4, we derive an exact expression of the one-loop eective
coupling constant and discuss its asymptotic property. in sect.5, the same
thing will be done for the eective fermion mass. the last section serves to

5

make some comments and discussions. in appendix a, we show a couple of
mathematical examples to help understanding the regularization procedure
used in the renormalization group calculations.

3 2.solution to rge and s-matrix element

among dierent formulations of the gre (see the review given in ref.(14))1015,

we like to employ the approach presented in ref.(15). but, we work in a
mass-dependent renormalization scheme, therefore, the anomalous dimen-
sion in the rge depends not only on the coupling constant, but also on the
fermion mass. suppose fr is a renormalized quantity. in the multiplicative
renormalization, it is related to the unrenormalized one f in such a way

f = zf fr

(3. 1)

where zf is the renormalization constant of f . in gms scheme, the zf and
fr are all functions of the renormalization point  = 0et. dierentiating
eq.(2.1) with respect to the  and considering that the f is independent of
, we immediately obtain a rge satised by the function fr



dfr
d

+ f fr = 0

where f is the anomalous dimension dened by

f = 

d
d

ln zf

(3. 2)

(3. 3)

we rst note here that the anomalous dimension can only depends on the
ratio  = mr
 , f = f (gr, ) because the renormalization constant is dimen-
sionless. in calculation of f , as stressed in introduction, the zf must be
given in the regularized form which depends on a regularization parame-
ter, say, the nonzero parameter  = 2  n/2 in the dimensional regulariza-
tion. otherwise, either the constant zf or the dierentiation in eq.(2.3)
are meaningless mathematically. the limit   0 should be taken after the
dierentiation with respect to . next, we note, eq.(2.2) is suitable for a
physical parameter (mass or coupling constant), a propagator, a vertex, a
wave function or some other green function. if the function fr stands for

6

a renormalized green function, vertex or wave function, in general, it not
only depends explicitly on the scale , but also on the renormalized coupling
constant gr, mass mr and gauge parameter r which are all functions of ,
fr = fr(p, gr(), mr(), r(); ) where p symbolizes all the momenta. in
this case, eq.(2.2) may be rewritten in the form of a partially dierential
equation15

[




+ 

gr



gr

+ 

mr




mr

+ 

r



r

+ f ]fr = 0

(3. 4)

considering that the function fr is homogeneous in the momentum and
mass, it may be written, under the scaling transformation of momentum
p = p0 , as follows

fr(p; gr, mr, r, ) = df fr(p0; gr,

mr


, r;




)

(3. 5)

where df is the canonical dimension of f . since the renormalization point
is a momentum taken to subtract the divergence, we may set  = 0 where
 = et which may be chosen to be the same as the one in p = p0. thus,
eq.(2.2) may be rewritten as

dfr
fr

= f ()

d


(3. 6)

on integrating the above equation over , we get15

fr(p; gr(), mr(), r(), 0)

= fr(p; gr, mr, r, 0)er 

1

d
 f ()

(3. 7)

in which gr(), mr() and r() are the running coupling constant, the
running mass and the running gauge parameter, respectively. combining
this solution with the scaling transformation in eq.(2.5), one may obtain15

fr(p; gr, mr, r, 0) = df er 

1

d

 f ()fr(p0;

gr(), mr()1, r(); 0)

(3. 8)

which shows the behavior of the function fr under the scaling of momenta.
how to determine the function fr(p0;   , 0) on the rhs of eq.(2.8)
when the fr(p0, ...) stands for a wave function, a propagator or a vertex?

7

this question can be unambiguously answered in mom scheme, but was
not answered clearly in the literature 27,28. noticing that the momentum p0
and the renormalization point 0 are xed, but may be chosen arbitrarily. of
course, we may set p2
0. with this choice, by making use of the boundary
condition satised by a propagator, a vertex or a wave function,

0 = 2

fr(p0; gr, mr, r, ) |p 2

0 =2= f (0)

r (p0; gr, mr, r)

(3. 9)

(see the examples given in the next section) and considering the homogeneity
of the function fr as mentioned in eq.(2.5), we may write

df fr (p0; gr(), mr()1, r(), 0) |
= f (0)

r

p2
0=2

0

(p; gr(), mr(), r())(3. 10)

where the function f (0)
r (p; gr(), mr(), r()) is of the form of free propaga-
tor, bare vertex or free wave function and independent of the renormalization
point. with the expression given in eq.(2.10), eq.(2.8) will nally be written
in the form

fr(p; gr, mr, r) = er 

1

d

 f ()f (0)

r (p; gr(), mr(), r())

(3. 11)

for the gauge eld theory, it is easy to check that the anomalous dimension
in eq.( 2.11) will be cancelled out in s-matrix elements. to show this point
more specically, let us take the two-electron scattering in t-channel as an
example. the scattering amplitude may be written as

sf i = u(p1)(p1, p1)u(p1)id(k)u(p2)(p2, p2)u(p2)

(3. 12)

where k = p1p1 = p2p2; u(p), (p, p) and id(k) represent the fermion
wave function, the proper vertex and the photon propagator respectively
which are all unrenormalized . they are connected with the renormalized
ones in such a fashion

u(p) = qz2ur(p)
(p, p) = z
r(p, p)
id(k) = z3idr (k)

(3. 13)
(3. 14)
(3. 15)

8

where z2,z and z3 are the renormalization constants of the wave function,
vertex and propagator respectively. it is noted that the vertex is dened here
by including a coupling constant in it. therefore, we have

z = z1

2 z 1

substituting eqs.(2.13)-(2.15) in eq.(2.12), we nd

sf i = ur(p1)

r(p1, p1)ur(p1)idr (k)ur(p2)

r(p2, p2)ur(p2)

(3. 16)

(3. 17)

where all the quantities become renormalized. according to the formula
given in eq.(2.11), these quantities can be represented in the form as shown
below. for the fermion wave function, we can write

where

ur(p) = er

is the anomalous dimension of the vertex here the relation in eq.(2.16) has
been used. upon substituting eqs.(2.18), (2.21) and (2.24) into eq.(2.27) and
noticing eqs.( 2.20), (2.23) and (2.26), we nd that the anomalous dimensions
in the s-matrix element are all cancelled out with each other. as a result,
we nally arrived at

sf i = u(0)

r (p1)(0)

r (p1, p1)u(0)

r (p2)

r (p1)id(0)

r (k)u(0)

r (p2)(0)

r (p2, p2)u(0)

(3. 26)
this expression clearly shows that the exact s-matrix element of the two-
electron scattering is now represented in the form as given in the lowest order
tree diagram approximation except that all the physical parameters in the
matrix elements are replaced by their eective (running) ones. for other s-
matrix elements, the conclusion is the same. this is because all of s-matrix
elements are unexceptionably expressed in terms of the wave functions, the
propagators and the proper vertices each of which can be represented in the
form as shown in eq.(2.11) and the anomalous dimensions in the matrix
elements , as can be easily proved, are cancelled out eventually. the above
result and the fact that any s-matrix element is independent of the gauge
parameter ( this is the so-called gauge-invariance of s-matrix).indicate that
the task of renormalization for a gauge eld theory is reduced to nding
the running coupling constant and the running mass by their rges. these
running quantities completely describe the eect of higher order perturbative
corrections.

3. ward identity

in qed renormalization, the following ward identity plays crucial role 6

(p; p)|p=p = 

(p)
p

10

(3. 1)

where (p, p) represents the vertex correction which is dened by taking out
a coupling constant e ( the electric charge) and (p) denotes the fermion self-
energy. firstly, we show how the above identity determines the subtraction

of the fermion self-energy p(p). according to the ward identity, in the
gms scheme, the divergence in (p, p) should be subtracted at a time-like
(minkowski) renormalization point for the momenta of external fermion lines,
p2 = p2 = 2 which implies 6 p =6 p = . when  = m(the fermion mass),
we will come to the subtraction in os scheme. in the case of  6= m, the
subtraction is dened on a generalized mass shell. at the renormalization
point , we have

(p, p) |6p=6p== l

thus, the vertex correction may be represented as

(p, p) = l + c

(p, p)

(3. 2)

(3. 3)

where l is a divergent constant depending on  and c
correction satisfying the boundary condition
(p, p) |6p=6p== 0
c

(p, p) is the nite

(3. 4)

on inserting eq.(3.3) into eq.(3.1) and integrating the both sides of

eq.(3.1) over the momentum p, we get

(p)  () = (6 p  )l z p

p

0

dpc

(p, p)

(3. 5)

where the momentum p0 is chosen to make 6 p0 = . since the last term on
the rhs of eq.(3.5) vanishes when p  p

0 , we may write

z p

p

0

dpc

(p, p) = (6 p  )c(p2)

(3. 6)

where c(p2) is a convergent function with the following boundary condition

which is implied by eq.(3.4). substituting eq.(3.6) into eq.(3.5) and setting

c(p2) |p2=2= 0

(3. 7)

() = a

11

(3. 8)

the self-energy is nally written as

l = b

(p) = a + (6 p  )[b  c(p2)]

(3. 9)

(3. 10)

where the constants a and b have absorbed all the divergences appearing in
the (p). the above derivation shows that the subtraction given in eq.(3.10)
is uniquely correct in the gms scheme as it is compatible with the ward
identity. according to the subtraction in eq.(3.3), the full vertex can be
written as

(p, p) =  + (p, p)
 (p, p)

= z1

1 r

where z1 is the vertex renormalization constant dened as

z1

1 = 1 + l

and r

 (p, p) is the renormalized vertex represented by

 (p, p) =  + r
r

 (p, p)

which satises the boundary condition

r(p, p) |6p=6p== 

(3. 11)

(3. 12)

(3. 13)

(3. 14)

based on the subtraction given in eq.(3.10), the full fermion propagator

may be renormalized in such a way

isf (p) =

i

6 p  m  (p) + i

= z2isr

f (p)

(3. 15)

where z2 is the propagator renormalization constant dened by

and sr

f (p) denotes the renormalized propagator represented as

z1
2 = 1  b

sr

f (p) =

i

6 p  mr  r(p) + i

12

(3. 16)

(3. 17)

which has a boundary condition as follows

sr
f (p) |p2=2=

i

6 p  mr

(3. 18)

in eq.(3.17), mr and r(p) designate the renormalized mass and the nite
correction of the self-energy respectively. the renormalized mass is dened
by

mr = z1

m m

where zm is the mass renormalization constant expressed by

m = 1 + z2[am1 + (1  m1)b]
z1

particularly, from eqs.(3.9), (3.12) and (3.16). it is clear to see

z1 = z2

(3. 19)

(3. 20)

(3. 21)

this just is the ward identity obeyed by the renormalization constants.

let us verify whether the ward identity is respected in the one-loop ap-
proximation. the feynman integrals of one-loop diagrams in qed have been
calculated in the literature by various regularization procedures36,14,. in the
gms scheme, the regularized form of the fermion self-energy as depicted in
fig.(1a) which is obtained by the dimensional regularization procedure, is as
follows

with the expressions given in eqs.(3.27) and (3.28), in the approximation
of order e2, the renormalization constants dened in eq.(3.12) and (3.16)
will be represented as z1 = 1  l and z2 = 1 + b.
in the limit   0,
these constants are divergent, having no denition mathematically. from
the viewpoint of mathematics, it is not permissible to use such constants to
do a calculation. so, to verify the ward identity, it is suitable to see whether
their anomalous dimensions satisfy the corresponding identity

1 = 2

(3. 29)

where i() = lim0  d
d ln zi(, )(i=1,2). for the calculation of rge, in
practice, the above identity is only necessary to be required. through direct
calculation by using the constants in eqs.(3.27) and (3.28), it is easy to prove

in eq.(3.30) reduces the result given in the ms scheme

1 = 2 =

(3. 31)

this result can be directly derived from such expressions of the constants
b and l which are obtained from eqs.(3.27) and (3.28) by setting m=0.
it is easy to see that in such expressions, only the terms proportional 1
give nonvanishing contributions to the anomalous dimensions. however, in
the case of m 6= 0, the terms proportional to 1 in eqs.(3.27) and (3.28)
give dierent results. in this case, to ensure the identity in eq.(3.30) to be
satised, the other terms without containing 1 in eqs.(3.27) and (3.28)
must be taken into account.

(4. 14)

it is clear that when   0, the r() tends to zero. this desirable behavior,
which indicates that at large distance (small momentum), the interacting

electromagnetic interaction. for large momentum (small distance), eq.(4.11)
will be approximated by

this result was given previously in the mass-independent ms scheme. in the
latter scheme, the  function in eq.(4.7) is only a function of the er()
since fe() = 1 due to m = 0 in this case. but, in general, the mass of a
charged particle is not zero, therefore, the result given in the ms scheme can
only be viewed as an approximation in the large momentum limit from the
viewpoint of conventional perturbation theory. fig.(3) shows that the r()
increases with the growth of  and tends to innity when the  approaches
if the

 goes from 0 to innity, we nd, the r() will become negative and
tends to zero. this result is unreasonable, conicting with the physics. the
unreasonableness indicates that in the region [0,), the qed perturbation
theory and even the qed itself is invalid11.

5.eective fermion mass

(5. 1)

where the anomalous dimension m(), according to the denition in eq.(2.3),
can be derived from the renormalization constant represented in eq.(3.20).
at one-loop level, by making use of the constants a, b and z2 which were
written in eqs.(3.25), (3.27) and (3.16), in the approximation of order e2, it

the mr() tends to zero much more rapidly than that
that for || 6= 0.
given in the landau gauge ( = 0). since s-matrix elements are gauge-
independent, for practical purpose, we may simply work in the landau gauge
which was regarded as preferred gauge in the literature9. in this gauge,

in the limit   0,

this indicates that when  varies from 1 to zero, the mr() almost keeps
unchanged. this result is physically reasonable. whereas, in the region of
 > 1, the mr() decreases with the increase of  and goes to zero near the
critical point 0. this result suggests that at very high energy, the fermion
mass may be neglected in evaluation of s-matrix elements.

6.comments and discussions

in this paper, the qed renormalization has been restudied in the gms
scheme. the exact and explicit expressions of the one-loop eective coupling

20

constant and fermion mass are obtained in the mass-dependent renormal-
ization scheme and show reasonable asymptotic behaviors. a key point to
achieve these results is that the subtraction is performed to respect the ward
identity, i.e. the gauge symmetry. for comparison, it is mentioned that in
some previous literature15,19, the fermion self-energy is represented in such a
form

(p) = a(p2) 6 p + b(p2)m

(6. 1)

if we subtract the divergence in the (p) at the renormalization point p2 = 2,
the fermion propagator is still expressed in the form as written in eqs.(3.15)
and (3.17); but, the renormalization constants z2 and zm are now dened
by

z1
2 = 1  a(2), z1

m = 1 + b(2)

(6. 2)

the one-loop expressions of the a(2) and b(2) can directly read from
eq.(3.22). here, we show the one-loop anomalous dimension of z2 given by
the above subtraction

e2

]

(6. 3)

in comparison of the above 2 with the 1 shown in eq.(3.30), we see, the
ward identity in eq.(3.29) can not be fullled unless in the zero-mass limit
(  0). since the ward identity is an essential criterion to identify whether
a subtraction is correct or not, the subtraction stated above should be ex-
cluded from the mass-dependent renormalization.

another point we would like to address is that in the ward identity
shown in eq.(3.1), the momenta p and p on the fermion lines in the vertex
are set to be equal. according to the energy-momentum conservation, the
momentum k on the photon line should be equal to zero. correspondingly,
the subtraction shown in eq.(3.2) was carried out at the so-called asymmetric
points, p2 = p2 = 2 and k2 = (p  p)2 = 0. these subtraction points coin-
cide with the energy- momentum conservation, i.e. the lorentz-invariance.
nevertheless, the subtraction procedure performed at the symmetric point

21

p2 = p2 = k2 = 2 was often used in the previous works 3,19,20. this pro-
cedure not only makes the calculation too complicated, but also violates the
energy- momentum conservation which holds in the vertex. that is why the
symmetric point subtraction is beyond our choice.

as mentioned in introduction, the gms subtraction is a kind of mom
scheme in which the renormalization points are chosen to be time-like. in
contrast, in the conventional mom scheme3,6,29, the renormalization points
were chosen to be space-like, i.e. p2
i = 2 which implies 6 pi = i. in this
scheme, the one-loop result for the anomalous dimension e can be written
out from eq.(4.6) by the transformation   i. that is

which is identical to that given in refs.(6) and (29).
in comparison with
eq.(4.6), we see, the 2 in eq.(6.4) changes a minus sign. substituting
eq.(6.4) into eq.(4.1) and solving the latter equation, we obtain the run-
ning coupling constant as represented in eq.(4.11), but the function g() in
eq.(4.11) is now given by

g() =

(6. 5)

which is obviously dierent from the corresponding one written in eqs.(4.12)
and (4.13). at small distance (  ), we still have the approximate ex-
pression presented in eq.(4.15). however, at large distance, as shown in
fig.(2), the r() behaves almost as a constant. when   0, it approaches
to a value equal to 0.99986r, unlike the r() given in eqs.(4.11) - (4.13)
which tends to zero. let us examine the eective mass. as we have seen
from sect.5, the one-loop eective fermion mass given in the gms scheme
is real. however, in the space-like momentum subtraction, due to 6 p = i,
the eective mass will contain an imaginary part. this result can be seen
from the function fm() whose one-loop expression given in the usual mom
scheme can be obtained from eq.(5.3) by the transformation   i and
therefore becomes complex. the both of subtractions may presumably be

22

required by dierent processes of dierent physical natures. but, if the eec-
tive mass is required to be real, the subtraction at space-like renormalization
point should also be ruled out.

as pointed out in sect.4, the eective coupling constant shown in
eq.(4.15) which was obtained in the ms scheme is only an approximation
given in the large momentum limit. why say so? as is well-known, the ms
scheme is a mass-independent renormalization scheme in which the fermion
mass is set to vanish in the process of subtraction. the reasonability of this
scheme was argued as follows1,15 .the fermion propagator can be expanded
as a series

1
+   
6 p
6pm may be replaced
according to this expansion, the massive propagator
by the massless one 1
6p. at the same time, the fermion mass, as the coupling
constant, can also be treated as the expansion parameter for a perturbation
series. nevertheless, in the mass-dependent renormalization as shown in this
paper, the massive fermion propagator is employed in the calculation and
only the coupling constant is taken to be the expansion parameter of the
perturbation series ( this means that we insist on the conventional perturba-
tion theory). thus, in order to get the perturbative result of a given order
of the coupling constant which is obtained in the mass-dependent renormal-
ization, according to eq.(6.6), one has to compute an innite number of
terms in the ms scheme. if only the rst term in eq.(6.6) is considered in
the ms scheme, the result can only be viewed as an approximation given
in the large momentum limit. even if for this limit, a good renormaliza-
tion scheme should still be required to eliminate the ambiguity and give an
unique result. to this end, we may ask whether there should exist the dier-
ence between the ms scheme and the ms scheme 2? as one knows, in the
mass-independent renormalization by using the dimensional regularization,
the ms scheme only subtracts the divergent term containing the -pole for a
feynman integral and uses this term to dene the renormalization constant.
while, the ms scheme is designed to include the unphysical terms   ln 4
(here  is the euler constant) in the denition of the renormalization con-
stant. the unphysical terms arise from a special analytical continuation of
the space-time dimension from n to 4. substitution of the two dierent renor-
3 er gives rise
malization constants mentioned above into the relation e = z

1

2

23

to dierent renormalized coupling constants if the higher order terms are
ignored. it would be pointed out that the above procedure of leading to the
dierence between the ms and ms schemes is not appropriate because the
procedure is based on the usage of the divergent form of the renormalization
constants. as emphasized in the introduction, according to the convergence
principle, the divergent renormalization constants are not allowed to be used
for deriving a meaningful quantity. the correct procedure to derive a renor-
malized quantity is to solve its rge whose solution is uniquely determined
by the anomalous dimension (other than the renormalization constant itself)
and boundary condition. as emphasized before, in computing the anoma-
lous dimension, the rigorous procedure is to start from the regularized form
of the renormalization constant. in the regularized form, it is unnecessary
and even impossible to divide a renormalization constant into a divergent
part and a convergent part. since the anomalous dimension is a convergent
function of  due to that the factor 1
 disappears in it, the limit   0 taken
after the dierentiation with respect to the renormalization point would give
a denite result. especially, the unphysical factor (4) (1 + ) appearing
in eqs.(3.25), (3.27) and (4.5) straightforwardly approaches to 1 in the limit.
therefore, the unphysical terms   ln 4 could not appear in the anoma-
lous dimension and the eective coupling constant. even if we work in the
zero-mass limit or in the large momentum regime, we have an only way to
obtain the eective coupling constant as shown in eq.(4.15) in the one-loop
approximation. that is to say, it is impossible to result in the dierence
between the ms and ms schemes and also the dierence between the mom
and the ms schemes.

the above discussions suggest that the ambiguity arising from dierent
renormalization prescriptions may be eliminated by the necessary physical
and mathematical requirements as well as the boundary conditions. it is ex-
pected that the illustration given in this paper for the qed one-loop renor-
malization performed in a mass-dependent scheme would provide a clue on
how to do the qed multi-loop renormalization and how to give an improved
result for the qcd renormalization.

8 appendix:

illustration of the regulariza-
tion procedure by a couple of mathematical
examples

we believe that if a quantum eld theory is built up on the faithful basis
of physical principles and really describes the physics, a s-matrix element
computed from such a theory is denite to be convergent even though there
occur divergences in the perturbation series of the matrix element. the
occurrence of divergences in the perturbation series, in general, is not to
be a serious problem in mathematics. but, to compute such a series, it is
necessary to employ an appropriate regularization procedure. for example,
for the following convergent integral

f (a) = z 

0

dxeax

(8. 7)

a . if we evaluate it by utilizing the series expansion of the

which equals to 1
exponential function

eax =



xn=0

(a)n
n!

xn

(8. 8)

as we see, the integral of every term in the series is divergent. in this case,
interchange of the integration and the summation actually is not permissible.
when every integral in the series is regularized, the interchange is permitted
and all integrals in the series become calculable. thus, the correct procedure
of evaluating the integral by using the series expansion is that as shown in
the following

f (a) = lim

this example is somewhat analogous to the perturbation series in the quan-
tum eld theory and suggests how to do the calculation of the series with
the help of a regularization procedure. unfortunately, in practice, we are not
able to compute all the terms in the perturbation series. in this situation, we
can only expect to get desired physical results from nite order perturbative
calculations. how to do it? to show the procedure of such calculations, let
us look at another mathematical example. the following integral

f (a) = z 

0

dx

e(x+a)
(x + a)2

(8. 10)

where a  0 is obviously convergent. when the exponential function is
expanded as the taylor series, the integral will be expressed as

(8. 11)

it is clear that the rst term in the above expansion is convergent, sim-
ilar to the tree-approximate term in the perturbation theory of quantum
eld theory. the second term is logarithmically divergent, analogous to the
one-loop-approximate term and the other terms amount to the higher order
corrections in the perturbation theory. to calculate the integral in eq.(a.4),
it is convenient at rst to evaluate its derivative,

(8. 12)

in order to get this result from the series expansion, we have to employ a
regularization procedure, as demonstrated below.

(8. 15)

where a0  0 is a xed number which should be determined by the boundary

term in the rst line of eq.(a.8). the integral of this term is convergent in
the limit    and can be obtained by taking the derivative of the second
term in eq.(a.4) with respect to a. thus, we can write

df1(a)

(8. 18)

this result is nite as long as the parameter ao is not taken to be zero and
can be regarded as the contribution of the divergent integral f1(a) appear-
ing in the second term of eq.(a.5) to the convergent integral f(a). the
procedure described above for evaluating the function f(a) much resembles
the renormalization group method and the approach proposed in ref.(9). it
shows us how to calculate a nite quantity from its series expansion which
contains divergent integrals.
