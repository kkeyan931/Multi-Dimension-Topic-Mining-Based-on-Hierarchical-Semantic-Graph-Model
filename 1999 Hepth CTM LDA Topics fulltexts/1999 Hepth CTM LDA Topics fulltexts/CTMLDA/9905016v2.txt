abstract: we give the analytic result for the fermion zero-mode of the su(2)
calorons with non-trivial holonomy. it is shown that the zero-mode is supported
on only one of the constituent monopoles. we discuss some of its implications.

1 introduction

in this paper we give the exact expression for the su(2) fermion zero-mode in the eld of the
innite volume caloron with non-trivial holonomy and unit charge. study of the gauge eld
congurations had, somewhat surprisingly, revealed that at non-trivial holonomy calorons
have two bps monopoles (n for su(n)) as their constituents [1, 2, 3]. for the harrington-
shepard [4] solution with trivial holonomy this is hidden, because one of the constituents is
massless (it can be removed by a singular gauge transformation to show that the caloron for
a large scale parameter becomes a single bps monopole [5]). we nd for calorons with well-
separated constituents, that the fermion zero-mode is entirely supported on one of them.
in itself it is not surprising that the zero-mode is correlated to the monopole constituents.
independently this observation was recently also made for gluino zero-modes in the context
of supersymmetric gauge theories [6]. gluinos are in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group, such that there are four zero-modes, that can be split in pairs associated to each
of the two constituents [6]. however, for the dirac fermion there is only one zero-mode.
to understand the anity of the zero-mode to only one of the two monopoles, we will
analyse in some detail what distinguishes them.

calorons are characterised by the (xed) holonomy [1, 7]. in the gauge in which a(x)

1

is periodic, this holonomy is given by

p = lim
|~x|

p exp z 

0

a0(t, ~x)dt!  exp(2i~  ~ ).

solutions are simplest in the so-called algebraic gauge, for which

a(t + , ~x) = pa(t, ~x)p

1, 

z (t + , ~x) = p

z (t, ~x).

(1)

(2)

we will generalise the problem of nding the fermion zero-mode in the eld of the
caloron with non-trivial holonomy, by adding a curvature free abelian eld, which forms
the basis for the nahm transformation [8]. why this is useful will be evident from the
construction. the equation to be solved is

dzz(x)  ( + a(x)  2iz)z(x) = 0,

(3)

with  = 
 = (1, i~ ) and a the pauli matrices. for calorons, dened on r3  s1,
i.e. at nite temperature 1/, one can choose z1 = z2 = z3 = 0 (the plane-wave factor
exp(2i~z ~x) does not aect the boundary conditions or the normalisation of the zero-mode
and can be used to remove the ~z dependence). but z = z0 will be arbitrary (it has a dual
period of 1/). the zero-modes are represented as two-component spinors in the (chiral)
weyl decomposition for massless dirac fermions.

2 adhm construction

the construction of the zero-mode is best done in the adhm formalism [9]. we will
be brief in reviewing this formalism, further details can be found in ref. [1, 10, 11, 12].
in general the adhm construction involves an operator (x) (the dual of eq. (3)),
whose normalised zero-mode, (x)v(x) = 0, gives the gauge eld as a(x) = v(x)v(x).
for su(2) instantons of charge k one has  = (, b  x), with x = x,  a k
dimensional row vector and b a k  k symmetric matrix, all with values in the quaternions
(
ij , with , m = 1,    , k charge and i, j = 1, 2 spinor indices, whereas
i = 1, 2 is a colour index). introducing the row vector u(x)  (b  x)1 and the scalar
(real quaternion) (x) = 1 + u(x)u(x), it can be shown [10, 11, 12] that the instanton
gauge eld and the k zero-modes are given by

ij = bm,

ii, b,m

a(x) = 1(x)im(cid:16)u(x)u(x)(cid:17) , 

where fx is the matrix inverse, or greens function,

ij (x) = 1 1

2 (x)(u(x)fx)

ii ij,

(4)

(5)

fx = (cid:16)(b  x)(b  x) + (cid:17)1

.

essential in the adhm construction is that  and b satisfy a quadratic constraint, which is
equivalent to fx being a symmetric matrix whose imaginary quaternion components vanish,
(fx),m
x ij . from this alone it can be proven that the gauge eld is self-dual and that
the (x) are zero-modes, d(x)  ( + a(x))(x) = 0. its proper normalisation
and the topological charge are read o from the remarkable results [10, 11, 12]

for the caloron with non-trivial holonomy, we perform one further simplication (for the
details follow eqs. (21-29) in ref. [1], see also ref. [10]),

a(x) = 1

ij (x) = (2)1
where the anti-selfdual t hooft tensor  is dened by i
(furthermore 12 = 1 and with our conventions of t = x0, 0123 = 1).

the caloron with non-trivial holonomy is found by imposing boundary conditions to
compactify time to a circle u+1(t + , ~x) = u(t, ~x)p 
, which is easily seen to give the
correct boundary conditions for the gauge eld. for the general form of  and b which
respect this symmetry, see ref. [1]. note that now the index  runs over the set of all inte-
gers; the r4 conguration with these boundary conditions has innite topological charge
(unit topological charge per time-period). to obtain the zero-mode with the appropriate
boundary condition we note that with eq. (4)

z(x)  x

e2iz(x),

(8)

satises the boundary condition z(t + , ~x) = e2izp z(t, ~x) and satises d z(x) = 0
for all z. the general solution of the weyl equation, eq. (3), with both periodic and
anti-periodic boundary conditions is now easily found (for simplicity we put  = 1)

+

z (x) = e2izt z(x), 

in particular (x) = 
chiral zero-mode in the background of a caloron, whereas +(x) = +
relevant for compactications.

(9)
0 (x) = 1/2(x) is the, for nite temperature, physically relevant
0 (x) = 0(x) is

z (x) = e2izt z+1/2(x).

3 nahm-fourier transformation

the interpretation of the charge index as a fourier index, as suggested by the con-
struction of the caloron zero-mode, has been essential for solving the quadratic adhm
constraint in the presence of non-trivial holonomy. it maps the adhm construction to
the nahm formalism, in which furthermore fx is solved in terms of a quantum mechanics
problem on the circle (z  [0, 1]) with a piecewise constant potential and delta function
singularities determined by the holonomy [1]. the relevant quantities involved are

fx(z, z) = x,m

x e2i(zmz ),
f ,m

(z) = x

e2iz,

(10)

where matrix multiplication is replaced by convolution in the usual sense. the solution of
the adhm constraint implies that (z) is the sum of two delta functions. together with
the explicit expression for the greens function fx(z, z) as given in eqs. (47-49) of ref. [1],
the zero-mode reads

z(x) = (2)1

5 properties of the zero-mode

the gauge eld has a symmetry under the anti-periodic gauge transformation g(x) =
2  .
exp(it  ~ ), which changes the sign of the holonomy, p  p, or    = 1
an anti-periodic gauge transformation does, however, not leave fermions invariant, and

4

z (x) and 

indeed it interchanges +
z (x). to preserve the special choice of parametrisation
presented above, the change of sign in the holonomy, which interchanges 1 and 2, is also
accompanied by an interchange of the constituent locations. this indeed leaves the action
density invariant. that the zero-mode clearly distinguishes between the two cases becomes
evident in the static limit,    (or equivalently   0), in which case the zero-mode is
completely localised on one of the constituent monopoles, as follows from (cmp. eq. (16))

lim


|(x)|2 = 2

(tanh(r22)

4r2

) ,

lim


|+(x)|2 = 2

( tanh(r11)

4r1

) .

(20)

under the anti-periodic gauge transformation the anti-periodic zero-mode becomes peri-
odic. the new anti-periodic zero-mode is now completely localised on the other constituent
monopole (this is consistent with the fact that fx(0, 0) can be obtained from fx( 1
2 ) by
interchanging r1 and 1 with r2 and 2). figure 1 illustrates these issues [13].

2 , 1

figure 1: for the two gures on the sides we plot on the same scale the logarithm of the
zero-mode densities (cuto below 1/e5) for  = 1/8 (left  / right +) and  = 3/8
(right  / left +), with  = 1 and  = 1.2. in the middle gure we show for the same
parameters (both choices of  give the same action density) the logarithm of the action
density (cuto below 1/2e2).

in the gauge where a(x) is periodic, for large  one of the constituent monopole elds
is completely time independent, whereas the other one has a time dependence that would
result from a full rotation along the axis connecting the two constituents [1]. this is read
o from

(note that for large , (x) becomes time independent.) this full rotation - which we
will call the taubes-winding - is responsible for the topological charge of the otherwise
time independent monopole pair [14]. under the anti-periodic gauge transformation that
changes the sign of the holonomy the taubes-winding is supported by the other constituent.
it has not gone unnoticed that the anti-periodic fermion zero-mode is precisely localised
on the monopole constituent that carries the taubes-winding. another way to distinguish
the two constituent monopoles is by inspecting the polyakov loop values at their centers.

5

one nds -1 for the monopole line with the taubes-winding and +1 for the other monopole
line (this is correlated to the vanishing of the would-be higgs eld), see the appendix of
ref. [15]. for trivial holonomy,  = 0, the polyakov loop is indeed -1 at the center of the
harrington-shepard [4] caloron. its zero-mode, constructed before in ref. [7, 16], agrees
with the results found here.

the association of the zero-mode with the constituent that carries the taubes-winding
lends considerable support for the role of the monopole loops with taubes-winding in
qcd for chiral dynamics [1]. the precise embedding of these straight nite tempera-
ture monopole loops as curved monopole loops in at space remains a non-trivial and
challenging problem. although it may seem contradictory to expect the zero-mode with
anti-periodic boundary conditions to be the relevant one, one should not forget that for a
curved monopole loop the spin frame makes also one full rotation due to the bending of
the loop, thereby most likely providing the compensating sign ip.
