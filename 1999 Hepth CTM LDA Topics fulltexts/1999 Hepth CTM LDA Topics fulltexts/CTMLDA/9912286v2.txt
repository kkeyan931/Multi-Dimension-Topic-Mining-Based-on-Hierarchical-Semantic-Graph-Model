abstract

we develop a method for computing exact one-loop quantum corrections to the ener-
gies of static classical backgrounds in renormalizable quantum eld theories. we use
a continuum density of states formalism to construct a regularized casimir energy in
terms of phase shifts and their born approximations. this method unambiguously
incorporates denite counterterms xed in the standard way by physical renormal-
ization conditions. the result is a robust computation that can be eciently imple-
mented both numerically and analytically. we carry out such calculations in models
of bosons and fermions in one and three dimensions.

introduction

given a static eld conguration in a renormalizable quantum eld theory, a natural

question to ask is what its energy is. this question is especially relevant in the

study of solitons, since they are local minima of the energy. classically, the energy is

simple to calculate from the lagrangian density of the theory. however, quantization

of the theory introduces corrections to this classical result. such corrections can be

expanded as a power series in the coupling constants of the theory, which is equivalent

to an expansion in h.

in this work we will consider the leading quantum corrections to the classical en-

ergies of eld congurations in a variety of quantum eld theories. since the power of

h counts the number of loops in the diagrammatic expansion of the energy, taking the

leading correction will correspond to a one-loop calculation, in which we sum all one-

loop diagrams with arbitrary numbers of insertions of the classical background eld.

this calculation is equivalent to summing the shifts in the 1

2 h zero-point energies of
all the small uctuations modes in the presence of the background eld. this sum

is known as the casimir energy. as usual in quantum eld theory, the result of such

a calculation diverges, and we must introduce divergent counterterms that are xed

through a nite set of renormalization conditions. the renormalization conditions

dene the theory in terms of physical quantities. our challenge will be to implement

such a calculation in a robust, ecient and unambiguous way. in particular, we must

isolate the cancellation of divergent quantities without missing any nite contribu-

6

tions, and we must be sure that we have implemented the renormalization conditions

faithfully. merely canceling the innities is clearly not sucient when we want to

regard a nite result as a physical prediction of a particular theory dened under

xed renormalization conditions.

one application of this method is in coupling of the higgs sector of the standard

model to heavy quarks. if we imagine adjusting the yukawa coupling for a quark dou-

blet so that the quarks mass becomes very large, we would expect that when they

become suciently heavy, they eectively decouple from the theory. however, this

cannot be the whole story, since if we simply removed a quark doublet from the stan-

dard model, we would ruin anomaly cancellation. the resolution of this paradox [1]

requires that solitons in the higgs eld carry the quantum numbers of the decoupled

fermions. this result suggests a picture in which heavy quarks are realized at small

coupling as elementary fermion excitations, and at large coupling as higgs solitons.

in between these two limits, one might then expect to nd a hybrid conguration,

with the heavy quark tightly bound to a deformation in the higgs eld. to see if this

picture is correct, we need to do a variational computation: we must nd the eld

conguration of lowest energy that carries the heavy quark quantum numbers. this

application highlights the importance of unambiguously xing our renormalization

conditions and avoiding nite errors in our energy computation. if our renormaliza-

tion conditions were not xed precisely, we would eectively be changing the theory as

we moved from one background eld to another, rendering the variational calculation

meaningless.

one could imagine building a higgs conguration that brings a heavy quark level

down from the mass of the quark closer to (or below) zero. the higgs conguration

itself would have an energy cost from the gradient and potential terms in the classical

bosonic hamiltonian. this cost could be balanced by the shift in the valence

quark energy level, since the quark occupying this state moves to a lower energy.

in particular, for strong quark yukawa coupling (which means large quark mass),

and small higgs self-coupling (which means small higgs mass), deforming the higgs

eld would be favored. however, these two pieces alone do not form a self-consistent

7

semiclassical calculation. we have included the classical energy along with one part of

the leading quantum correction to that energy, the shift in the valence level. we have

no justication for ignoring the shifts in all the other quark levels, which contribute

at the same order through their zero-point energies. thus we are forced consider the

full casimir energy in this problem. if we do include the casimir energy, we obtain

a self-consistent semiclassical result. one may doubt the validity of the semiclassical

approximation as the coupling gets large, of course, but we will obtain a result that

is valid in a well-dened approximation. (in some models, it is also the exact result

in a large-n limit [2].)

although we must compute the full casimir energy, not just the valence contri-

bution, it is still possible to construct self-consistent approximations to this quantity.

of course, these approximations further restrict the domain of validity of the com-

putation. in particular, if the background eld is slowly varying on the scale of the

compton wavelength of the quantum uctuations, the derivative expansion becomes

valid. indeed, it has been used in models similar to the ones we will consider [2].

however, in both models of heavy quarks and other models we will want to explore,

the scale at which the background eld varies is precisely the compton wavelength

of the quantum uctuations, so that all the terms in the derivative expansion will be

about the same size, rendering the expansion unreliable. our approach will be exact

to one-loop order.

central to our technique will be to re-express the casimir sum in the continuum

in terms of phase shifts, using a formalism that originates with schwingers work on

qed in the presence of strong elds [3]. we will consider only eld congurations with

some form of spherical symmetry, so that we can use a partial-wave decomposition.

in each channel, the dierence between the free and interacting density of states is

related to the phase shift by

(k) = 0(k) +

1


d(k)

dk

(1.1)

which follows from imposing a boundary on the system and then sending the boundary

8

to innity, or by more formal s-matrix arguments. in any channel, for any k, the

phase shift is a nite, well-dened, physical quantity. its analytic structure is well

understood in terms of jost functions, and it can also be rigorously related to the

greens functions and s-matrix of the theory. the sum over continuum modes is then

replaced by an integral over the density of states

e =

1

2 xj

j +

1

2 z 

0

dkk2 + m2(k)

(1.2)

in which the bound states are still included explicitly. this mathematical artillery

leads to several important properties of the phase shifts:

 we can expand the phase shifts as a born series in the strength of the poten-
tial. this expansion is in exact correspondence with the expansion of the full

propagator of the theory in terms of the free propagators connecting insertions

of the potential. the born expansion also has simple behavior at large k and

becomes more and more accurate in this limit, which will enable us to use it as

a regulator of ultraviolet divergences.

 the phase shifts track level crossings, ensuring a consistent counting of modes
as states become bound. this property allow us to avoid a serious problem we

would encounter if we put the system in a box, because in that case we would

have a hard time ensuring that we have kept the appropriate number of modes

when computing the casimir energy and the contribution of the counterterms.

missing even one mode in the casimir sum will lead to a drastic change in the

nal answer; although such an error is small compared to the leading (divergent)

behavior of the sum, the leading behavior is cancelled by the counterterms. the

nal answer is generically of the same order as a typical energy level. our key

tool here will be levinsons theorem, which relates the phase shift at k = 0 to

the number of bound states.

 the phase shifts and their born approximations are simple, robust quantities
amenable to both numerical and analytic calculation. we will see that they

9

enable us to replace the cancellations of large quantities, the casimir energy

against the counterterms, by the much more manageable cancellation of exact

phase shift against born approximation. many cases will in the end be tractable

only numerically, but we will also nd that numerical analysis will also shed light

on analytic results by allowing us to continuously interpret between a trivial

conguration and one that can be solved analytically.

 the absence of boundaries will allow us to avoid spurious contributions from
articial boundary conditions. this property will be especially useful in models

with fermions.

 in principle, phase shifts can even be computed in fractional dimensions, since
they obey a simple radial dierential equation that depends analytically on

the dimension of space. in particular, the rst born approximation the bosonic

phase shifts can be analytically calculated in arbitrary dimensions terms of gen-

eralized bessel functions. this result agrees exactly with the result one would

nd for the corresponding tadpole graph evaluated in dimensional regulariza-

tion.

much of this work originally appeared in [4].

4 theory in 1+1 dimensions

we will begin with examples in 1+1 dimensions. the study of exactly soluble 1+1

dimensional problems has yielded many insights into fundamental problems in eld

theory. other 1+1 dimensional problems cannot be solved exactly, making it impor-

tant to understand which properties of exact results will generalize to more generic

cases and which are special to the exactly soluble cases. the renormalization process

is simpler in one dimension than it is in three, since theories in lower dimensions are

less divergent, but it still must be approached carefully. indeed, we will nd that the

one dimensional problem actually contains additional subtleties not present in higher

dimensions.

2.1 formalism

we will consider a standard 4 theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking and a

source j(x). the action is

s[] =

m2

 z   1

2

()2 

m2
8

(2  1)2  j(x) + lct! d2x

(2.1)

where lct is the counterterm lagrangian. our metric has gtt = gxx = 1. we
have rescaled the eld  somewhat unconventionally in order to make explicit the

correspondence between the powers of  and the powers of h, which we have set equal

11

to 1. classical terms will go as 1

, the one-loop terms we compute will go as 0, and
higher loops will contribute with higher powers of . the mass of uctuations around
the trivial vacua (x) = 1 is m, and we dene the potential u() = m2
8 (2  1)2.
we consider a xed eld conguration 0(x). initially we will assume that 0(x) =
0(x), which restricts us to the topologically trivial sector of the theory. however,
we will see that our method works equally well for the case of 0(x) = 0(x), so
that in fact we can deal with congurations with any topology as long as u(0) has

reection symmetry. we adjust the source so that 0 is a stationary point of the

action, which means that j then solves the equation

j(x) =

d20
dx2 

1
2

m2(3

0  0).

(2.2)

we can always solve this equation for j, but there is no guarantee that the j we nd

will always correspond to a unique 0, as we will see later. if 0 is a solution to the

equations of motion, of course the source will be zero.

we would like to consider the leading quantum correction to the classical energy

of this conguration, which we can represent as the sum of the zero-point energies of

the normal modes of small oscillations around 0. writing  = 0 + , the normal

modes are solutions of

d2
dx2 + (v (x) + m2) = 2



(2.3)

with v (x) = u(0(x))  m2 = 3
going from the trivial vacuum to 0(x) is then

2 m2(2

0(x)  1). the quantum change in energy in

e[0] =

1
2

(x  x 0) + ect = e + ect

(2.4)

where 0 are the free solutions (with 2

0(x) = 1), and ect is the contribution from the

counterterms.

note that it is possible that some of the values of 2 will be negative, so that

in these directions our stationary point is a local maximum rather than a minimum

of the action. these solutions will add an imaginary part to the energy, which we

12

can interpret via analytic continuation as giving the decay rates through the unstable

modes [5]. if there is a direction in eld space in which small oscillations lower the

energy, we should be able to keep going in that direction and arrive at a lower min-

imum. later, we will see explicitly that the appearance of unstable modes coincides

with the existence of a second solution to the 0 equation with the same j and lower

energy.

we would like to rewrite the sum over zero-point energies as an integral over

phase space of the product of the energy and the density of states. we can then

break this integral into a sum over bound states and an integral over a continuum,

representing the latter in terms of phase shifts. in order to do so, however, we must

review the peculiarities of levinsons theorem in one dimension. for more details on

these results see [6] and [7]. for a symmetric v (x), we can divide the continuum states

into symmetric and antisymmetric channels, and then calculate the phase shift as a

function of k separately for each channel, where 2 = k2 + m2. the antisymmetric

channel is completely equivalent to the l = 0 case in three dimensions, so we have

a(0) = na

(2.5)

where na is the number of antisymmetric bound states. however, we must be careful

in dealing with the special case of a state exactly at k = 0. in this case the solution
to eq. (2.3) with k = 0 goes asymptotically to a constant as x  , as opposed to
the generic case where the k = 0 solution goes to a constant plus linear terms in x.

just as in the l = 0 case in three dimensions, this state contributes 1

2 to na. we will

refer to such states as half-bound states.

in the symmetric channel, levinsons theorem becomes

s(0) = ns 


2

(2.6)

where a bound state at k = 0 contributes 1

2 to ns, just as in the antisymmetric case.
we can see the importance of getting the half-bound states right by looking at the

free case: the phase shift is zero everywhere, and the right-hand side is zero because

13

the free case has a half-bound state (the wavefunction  = constant). the situation

is equally subtle for reectionless potentials, all of which have half-bound states and

s(0) + a(0) equal to an integer times .

we are now ready to rewrite the change in the zero-point energies in terms of

phase shifts. letting ej be the bound state energies (again with k = 0 bound states

contributing with a 1

2), (k) be the density of states and 0(k) be the free density of

states, we have

(2.8)

note that the m

4 term subtracts the contribution of the free half-bound state.

eq. (2.7) is divergent (the phase shifts fall as 1

k for k  ), which is what we
should expect since it includes the divergent contribution from the tadpole graph

without the divergent contribution from the counterterms that cancels it.

to avoid infrared problems later, we rst use levinsons theorem to compute the

change in particle number, which is given by

0 = xj

where again, half-bound states are counted with a 1

equation from eq. (2.7), we have

e =

(a(k) + s(k)).

(2.10)

14

next, we and subtract the rst born approximation to eq. (2.10), which corre-

sponds exactly to the tadpole graph. we must then add it back in using ordinary

renormalized perturbation theory. however, in 1+1 dimensions we can adopt the

simple renormalization condition that the counterterms cancel the tadpole graph and

perform no additional nite renormalizations beyond this cancellation. with this

choice, there is then nothing to add back in.

the rst born approximation is given by

(1)
s (k) = 
(1)
a (k) = 

1

k z 
k z 

1

0

0

v (x) cos2 kx dx

v (x) sin2 kx dx.

(2.11)

notice that the sum of these two depends on v (x) only through the quantity hv i =
r 0 dxv (x), so we can indeed cancel the tadpole contribution with available countert-

erms.

subtracting the rst born approximation, we have

e[0] =

1

2 xj

(ej  m) +z 

0

dk
2

((k)  m)

d
dk

(a(k) + s(k) + hv i

).

(2.12)

since the born approximation becomes exact at large k, the hv i
k

term exactly cancels

the leading 1

completely nite and well-dened, since the integrand goes like 1

k behavior of the phase shift at large k. as a result, this integral is
k2 for k   and
goes to a constant at k = 0. we must nd such a result, since in 1+1 dimensions

eliminating the tadpole is sucient to render the theory nite.

in particular, we are free to integrate by parts, giving an expression that will be

easier to deal with computationally,

e[0] =

1

2 xj

(ej  m) z 

0

dk
2

k

(k)

(a(k) + s(k) + hv i
k

).

(2.13)

our use of levinsons theorem to regularize e in the infrared (replacing eq. (2.7)

by eq. (2.10)) avoided a subtlety of the born approximation in one dimension that

15

does not occur in higher dimensions: as k  0, the symmetric contribution from
eq. (2.11) introduces a spurious infrared divergence, since it goes like 1
k . (each higher
dimension adds a power of k near k = 0. we can see this in the feynman diagram

calculation, where these powers of k come from the measure.)

2.2 applications

we can now use eq. (2.13) to calculate quantum energies for specic eld congura-

tions. knowing that our model has a kink soliton solution 0(x) = tanh mx

2 , we
will consider a family of eld congurations that continuously interpolate between

the trivial vacuum and a soliton/antisoliton pair,

0(x, x0) = tanh

m
2

(x + x0)  tanh

m
2

(x  x0)  1,

(2.14)

with 2x0 measuring approximately the separation between the soliton and antisoliton.

unlike the kink, these congurations are not solutions of the equations of motion,
except in the x0  0 and x0   limits. thus we will need to to introduce a source
that will vanish in these limits, and we must analyze the stability questions we raised

earlier.

for x0 very small, we simply have a small attractive perturbation from the trivial

vacuum held in place by a small source, which we would not expect to introduce any

instabilities.

in terms of the scattering problem, for small x0, the potential is too

weak to bind a state with a binding energy greater than m, which would give an

imaginary eigenvalue.

for x0 very large, we have a widely separated soliton/antisoliton pair. we know

from translation invariance that a single soliton has a mode with 2 = 0. since this

zero mode corresponds to a nodeless wavefunction, it is the lowest energy mode. the

soliton/antisoliton pair has two translation modes that will mix, giving a symmetric

eigenstate with a slightly lower energy and an antisymmetric eigenstate with a slightly

higher energy. thus we expect to nd a single symmetric mode with 2 < 0, which

16

will contribute an imaginary part to e[0]. the imaginary part gives the rate for
our eld conguration to decay through this mode toward the trivial vacuum. as
x0  , we should nd that the imaginary part goes to zero, and the real part goes
to twice the energy of a single soliton, which we compute exactly below.

according to this analysis, there should be a nite, nonzero value of x0 where

the imaginary eigenvalue rst appears. at this point, the eld becomes unstable

with respect to small perturbations in some direction in eld space. therefore, the

energy must have a lower minimum that we can reach by moving in that direction.

this conguration 0(x, x0) is a second stationary point of the action with the same

source, which crosses 0 at the value of x0 where the imaginary part for the energy

appears. (for smaller values of x0, this solution still exists but has higher energy.)

in terms of the scattering problem, this crossing appears when the potential has a

bound state with 2 = 0. we can identify this state explicitly: since 0 and 0

satisfy eq. (2.2) with the same j, as we approach the crossing, the wavefunction
(x) = 0(x, x0)  0(x, x0) becomes a solution to eq. (2.3) with 2 = 0.

we have carried out this computation numerically, and nd results that agree

with all of these expectations. to compute the antisymmetric phase shift, we will

parameterize the wavefunction as

(x) = eikx  eikxe2i(x)

(2.15)

where (x) is an arbitrary complex function. solving the dierential equation for

(x) subject to (0) = 0, we nd

a(k) = 2 re (k, 0)

where (k, x) is 0 at x =  and satises

 i + 2k + 2()2 +

1
2

v (x) = 0,

(2.16)

(2.17)

with prime denoting dierentiation with respect to x. to obtain the symmetric phase

17

shift, we can follow the same derivation, but instead of imposing (0) = 0 on the

wavefunction, we instead impose (0) = 0, giving

e2is =

e2i
e2i

k + 2
k + 2

with  the same as above, so that

s(k) = a(k)  tan1(

2 im (k, 0)

below this value, 0 has lower classical energy, while above this point, 0 has lower

classical energy, and this crossing appears precisely where the imaginary eigenvalue

appears in the small oscillations spectrum.

through this continuous deformation from the trivial vacuum, we have arrived at a

widely separated soliton/antisoliton pair, which we can now separate into independent

congurations with nontrivial topology. these congurations are exactly soluble, so

we will be able to study them analytically. however, our method does not rely on

19

f
having an analytic solution, so we could numerically calculate the energy of a generic

eld conguration with nontrivial topology using the same techniques.

2.3 analytic results

in one dimensional quantum mechanics, potentials of the form

v(x) = 

 + 1



m2sech2(

mx


)

(2.20)

with  an integer are exactly soluble and reectionless. their properties are sum-

marized in appendix a. the single soliton solution in our model, 0(x) = tanh mx
2 ,
corresponds to v (x) =  3
2 , the  = 2 case of this family. (the sine-gordon
soliton corresponds to the  = 1 case.) for a reectionless potential, s(k) = a(k); to

2m2sech2 mx

reconcile this equality with levinsons theorem in the symmetric and antisymmetric

channels, vl(x) must have a half-bound state. (we saw this behavior already for the
 = 0 case, the free particle.) we also note that although s = a, (1)
s

a , so the

6= (1)

renormalized contributions from the symmetric and antisymmetric channels are not

the same. in addition, the bound state contributions will also be unequal.

for our case, the exact result for the phase shift is

s(k) = a(k) =  tan1

3mk

m2  2k2 ,

(2.21)

where the branch of the arctangent is chosen so that the phase shift is continuous
and goes to zero for k  . the born approximation is

(1)
s (k) + (1)

a (k) =

3m
k

.

(2.22)

there are three bound states: a translation mode with e = 0, a state with

e = m3

2

, and a half-bound state with e = m. using eq. (2.12) or eq. (2.13) we nd

e[0] = m(

1
43 

3
2

)

20

(2.23)

in agreement with [11], [10], and the mode number cuto method in [8].

we can calculate the energy of the soliton of the sine-gordon model using the

same methods. in this model, the m2

4 (2  1)2 potential is replaced by

u() = m2(cos   1)

which has soliton (anti-soliton) solutions

0 = 4 tan1(exp(m(x  x0))).

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.27)

the bound states are just the translation mode at e = 0 and the half-bound state

at e = m, giving

e[0] = 

m


(2.28)

again agreeing with the established results.

chapter 3

fermions in one dimension

we next extend our methods by adding fermions. we will see that our techniques

extend cleanly and unambiguously to this case, and deal elegantly with the subtleties

of boundary conditions.

3.1 formalism

we consider a majorana fermion  interacting with a scalar background eld , with

the classical lagrangian density

l =

m2

2 (cid:16)i /  m  + l(cid:17)

(3.1)

where l is the lagrangian density for the  background eld, which we will take
to be the same as in the last section, with the same soliton solutions. we note

that choosing the lagrangian density in this way causes the bosonic and fermionic

degrees of freedom to be related by supersymmetry for a background eld that is a

solution to the equations of motion (such as a single soliton or an innitely separated

soliton/antisoliton pair). in this section, we will use this property only because we

will nd it instructive to compare the bosonic and fermionic small oscillations spectra.

in the next section, we will consider the full supersymmetric model.

the one-loop corrections to the energy due to fermionic uctuations will be

22

given by the appropriately renormalized sum of the zero-point energies,  1
2 , of
the fermionic small oscillations. the spectrum of fermionic small oscillations in a

background 0(x) is given by the dirac equation,

0 i1 d

dx

+ vf (x)! k(x) = f

k k(x)

(3.2)

where vf (x) = m0(x) is the fermionic potential and k = 2  m2 is the momen-

tum labeling the scattering states.

we will choose the convention 0 = 2 and 1 = i3 so that the majorana con-

dition becomes simply  = . we note that since our lagrangian is cp invariant,

all of our results for the spectrum of a majorana fermion can be extended to a dirac

fermion simply by doubling.

again, we will need to nd the phase shifts. we can solve for the phase shifts
of any fermionic potential vf (x) that satises vf (x) = vf (x) and vf (x)  m as
x   by generalizing the methods of the previous section. this form will be
useful for considering our example of a sequence of background eld congurations

that continuously interpolates between the trivial vacuum and a widely separated

soliton-antisoliton pair.

in the limit of innite separation, the phase shift for the

pair goes to twice the result for a single soliton. for comparison, we also do the

computation for a single soliton directly below.

we dene the parity operator acting on fermionic states as p = 0, where 
sends x  x. p commutes with the hamiltonian, so parity is a good quantum
number. as a result, we can separate the small oscillations into positive and negative

parity channels, now restricted to k > 0 in the continuum.

we parameterize the fermion solutions by

and

ei(x)

1(x) =

(3.7)

with the boundary condition that (x) and (x) vanish at innity. the total phase

shift is given by summing the phase shifts in each channel, f (k) = +(k) + (k).

again, once we know the phase shifts, levinsons theorem tells us how many

bound states there will be. it works exactly the same way as in the bosonic case [7]:

in the odd parity channel, the number of bound states n is given by

(0) = n

while in the even parity channel the number of bound states n+ is given by

+(0) = (n+ 

1
2

).

(3.8)

(3.9)

one can derive this result either by the same jost function methods used in the boson

24

case, or by observing that at small k, the nonrelativistic approximation becomes valid

so the bosonic results carry over directly. as in the boson case, for a particular

potential there may exist a k = 0 state in either of the two channels whose dirac
wavefunction goes to a constant spinor as x  . (generically, for k = 0 the
components of the dirac wavefunction go to straight lines as x  , but not lines
with zero slope.) just as in the bosonic case, such threshold states (which we will

again call half-bound states) should be counted with a factor of 1

2 in levinsons

theorem.

given the phase shifts and bound state energies, we can calculate the one-loop

fermionic correction to the energy. we continue to work in the simple renormalization
scheme in which we add a counterterm proportional to 2 1, and perform no further
renormalizations. the counterterm is xed by requiring that the tadpole graph cancel.

as in the bosonic case, we use the density of states

(k) = 0(k) +

to write

e[0] = 

where  = k2 + m2 and the sum over j counts bound states with appropriate factors
of 1

as

e[0] = 

1

2 xj

(j  m) z

(  m)

(3.12)

in terms of the shifted eld   1, the (divergent) contribution from the tadpole
graph is given by the leading born approximation to f . a corresponding divergence
related by    symmetry appears in the second-order diagram. to subtract
the tadpole graph, we subtract the leading born approximation in vf  m. in order
to maintain the    symmetry, we also subtract the corresponding piece of
the second-order diagram by subtracting the part of the second born approximation

related by the symmetry. since we have chosen the counterterm to exactly cancel

25

these subtractions, there is nothing to add back in. thus we have

1

e[0] = 

where

(1)(k) =

k z (cid:16)vf (x)2  vf (x)  m2(cid:17) dx

(3.13)

(3.14)

which can also be obtained numerically by iterating eq. (3.7). for the soliton/antisoliton

pair, the contribution from v (x) vanishes since it is a total derivative, so that again
our subtraction is indeed proportional to 2  1.

3.2 applications

we continue to study a sequence of background elds labeled by a parameter x0 that

continuously interpolates from the trivial vacuum (x) = 1 at x0 = 0 to a widely
separated soliton/antisoliton pair at x0  ,

(x, x0) = 1 + tanh

(3.15)

fig. 3-1 shows the fermionic bound state energies as a function of x0. in the limit

x0   two bound states approach energy m
parity combinations of the single soliton bound state at m

3
2 . these are simply the odd and even
3
2 . the third (positive
parity) bound state approaches  = 0 where the single soliton also has a bound state,

but there is only one such state (with  > 0). thus for a single soliton we must thus

count the zero mode with a factor of 1

2. we will see this result analytically below.

for any nite x0, levinsons theorem holds without subtleties; there are no states

that require factors of 1

2. thus for a large but nite x0, we nd

consistent with having two positive parity and one negative parity bound states (see
fig. 3-1). in the limit x0  , an even parity half-bound threshold state enters
the spectrum at  = m just as in the bosonic case. also, in this limit, the lowest

(positive parity) mode approaches  = 0, and is only counted as a 1

2 as described
above. finally, a negative parity mode enters the spectrum from below, also to be

weighted by 1
2.

theorem requires the phase shift (0) to jump from  to 3

thus the net change is to add half of a negative parity state, which via levinsons
2 as x0  . this jump
occurs by the same continuous but nonuniform process as in all cases where a new

state gets bound, which is illustrated in fig. 3-2. just as in the bosonic case, in the

limit of innite separation the potential we have chosen becomes reectionless, which

requires +(k) = (k).

to contrast the behavior of the zero modes, fig. 3-3 shows 2 for the bound states

of the bosonic small oscillations. because we have chosen the bosonic potential to be

consistent with supersymmetry, the bosonic and fermionic spectra are related. again

chapter 4

the supersymmetric model in one

dimension

having analyzed bosons and fermions separately, we now combine these results and

consider the full supersymmetric mode in one dimension. here we will work analyt-

ically using a general potential, with the 4 and sine-gordon theories providing two

concrete examples. the supersymmetric model also introduces another quantity, the

central charge, which we must also compute in order to check the consistency of our

results for the energy. a review of the literature shows a wide variety of conicting

results[8, 12, 13, 9, 14, 15]. our techniques for dealing with the regularization, renor-

malization and calculation of one-loop corrections to the energies of classical eld

congurations will enable us to take a fresh look at this problem. we will obtain an

unambiguous result for the energy and the central charge, and in the process we will

see how our techniques are related to the expansion of the quantum eld in creation

and annihilation operators.

4.1 formalism

we begin with the classical supersymmetric lagrangian density in 1+1 dimensions

l =

m2

2 (cid:16)()()  u()2 + i /  u() (cid:17)

(4.1)

30

where  is a real scalar,  is a majorana fermion, and u() = m

2 (2  1) for the 4
model and u() = 2m sin(/2) for the sine-gordon model. these models support

classical soliton and antisoliton solutions, which are the solutions to

0(x) = u(0)

(4.2)

for the soliton and antisoliton respectively. in the 4 model, the soliton solution is

the kink that we have already discussed,

kink

,

while the soliton in the sine-gordon model is given by

sg
0 (x) = 4 tan1 emx,

(4.3)

and in both cases the antisoliton is obtained from the soliton by sending x  x.
the eigenvalue equations for the bosonic and fermionic small oscillations are

with  = 1 for the sine-gordon soliton and  = 2 for the kink. repeating our results

and bound states at  = 0 for the kink  =

2

, and at  = 0 for the sine-gordon

soliton. as discussed above, both potentials have half-bound states at threshold, a

necessary consequence of their reectionless property.

as above, we avoid subtleties of boundary conditions by computing the fermionic

phase shifts for a widely separated soliton and antisoliton solution, with the antisoliton
on the left so that u()  m as x  . we will use the second-order equation
obtained by squaring eq. (4.6),

(4.12)

where (k) is the phase shift for the bosonic potential v(x) and (k) is the phase

soliton giving

k(x) = eikx

 .

(4.13)

32

by rescaling the results from appendix a, we easily obtain

(k) = (k)  2 tan1 m

so that for the soliton/antisoliton pair,

and thus for a single soliton

f (k) = b(k)  2 tan1 m

k

f (k) = b(k)  tan1 m

k

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

in both models. this result has been also been obtained in [13] and [9]. through

this analysis, we see that the decit between the boson and fermion phase shifts is

necessary so that eq. (4.12) correctly solves the dirac equation in the region where
vf (x) = m. this result also agrees with the methods of the previous section.

these results generalize to any supersymmetric potential u() that supports a
soliton 0 with 0(x) = 0(x). we can still consider eq. (4.9), with v(x) and
v(x) replaced by

and

v (x) = u(0)2 + u(0)u(0)  m2

v (x) = u(0)2  u(0)u(0)  m2.

(4.17)

(4.18)

these are symmetric, though now not necessarily reectionless, bosonic potentials.
we decompose their solutions into symmetric and antisymmetric channels. for x 
, these solutions are given in terms of phase shifts as

s
k (x) = cos(kx  s(k))
k (x) = i cos(kx  s(k))
s

k (x) = sin(kx  a(k))

with positive and negative parity respectively. the phase relation between the upper
and lower components of these wavefunctions must be dierent as x   since the
mass term has opposite signs in these two limits.
putting this all together gives, as x  ,

(4.26)

and we obtain the same result, eq. (4.16), as we found in the reectionless case.

since f (0) 6= b(0), levinsons theorem requires that the spectrum of fermionic
and boson bound states dier. the dierence is that, although there is a fermionic

fermions. (the fermionic states at threshold also count as 1

bound state for every bosonic bound state, the mode at  = 0 only counts as 1

2 for the
2, the same as in the boson
case.) we have seen this dierence in the previous section by the tracking the bound

state energies as we interpolated between the trivial vacuum and a soliton/antisoliton

pair. we can also check this result analytically by observing that the residue of the
pole at k = im in the reection coecient tf is half the residue of the pole at k = im
in tb because of eq. (4.16). as a nal check, we imagine doubling the spectrum
by turning  into a complex scalar and  into a dirac fermion. then in a soliton

background  would have two zero-energy bound states, one involving its real part and

one involving its imaginary part. however,  would have only a single zero-energy

bound state, with wavefunction given by

(4.27)

with vf (x) = u(0). the corresponding solution with only an lower component is

not normalizable; for an antisoliton, we would nd the same situation with upper and

lower components reversed. thus when we reduce to a majorana fermion, we count

this state as a half.

we note that the fermionic phase shift and bound state spectrum are simply

given by the average of the results we would obtain for the two bosonic potentials
v(x) and v(x). we also note that just as the bosonic zero mode arises because the

soliton breaks translation invariance, the fermionic zero mode arises as a consequence

of broken supersymmetry invariance (which we can think of as breaking translation

invariance in a fermionic direction in superspace). for a soliton solution, only the

35

supersymmetry generator q is broken, while q+ is left unbroken (the situation is
reversed for an antisoliton). thus since the supersymmetry is only half broken, it is

not surprising that the corresponding zero mode counts only as a half. in both cases,

acting with the broken generator on the soliton solution gives the corresponding zero

mode.

4.2 applications

to compute the one-loop correction to the energy, we now follow the same method

as in the previous sections and sum the quantity 1

2 over bosonic and fermionic
states, with the fermions entering with a minus sign as usual. we will discuss the

case of an isolated soliton, and see that results agree with the widely separated soli-

ton/antisoliton pair considered in the last section.

thus our formal expression for the energy correction is

where the states at threshold and the fermion bound state at  = 0 are weighted by

fermions, as required by supersymmetry. again, to avoid infrared problems later, we

use levinsons theorem

where the 1

the continuum integral in eq. (4.30) is still logarithmically divergent at large

k, as we should expect since we have not yet included the contribution from the

counterterm. as above, we can isolate this divergence in the contributions from the

36

low order born approximations to the phase shifts b and f . we then identify these

contributions with specic feynman graphs, subtract the born approximations, and

add back in the associated graphs. for the boson, the divergence comes from the rst

born approximation, which corresponds exactly to the tadpole graphs with a bosonic

loop. for the fermion, the source of the divergence is more complicated: we subtract

the rst born approximation to the fermionic phase shift and the piece of the second

born approximation that is related to it by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of

. this subtraction corresponds exactly to subtracting the tadpole graph with a

fermionic loop and the part of the graph with two external bosons and a fermionic

loop that is related to the tadpole graph by spontaneous symmetry breaking (the

rest of the two-point function is then nite). for both the boson and fermion, this

the leading 1

these 1

subtraction amounts to simply subtracting the term proportional to 1

k that cancels
k behavior of the phase shift at large k. we can identify the coecient of
k terms with the coecients of the logarithmic divergences in the corresponding
diagrams. as a result, by computing the divergences in the bosonic and fermionic

diagrams, we obtain a check on eq. (4.16), to leading order in 1

k for k large.

of course we must add back all that we have subtracted, together with the con-

tribution from the counterterm. to do so we must consider renormalization. we will

continue to use our simple renormalization scheme, in which we introduce only the

subtraction

which is equivalent to

l  l  cu()u()  cu() 

u()  u() +


m2 cu()

(4.31)

(4.32)

and thus preserves supersymmetry. we x the coecient c by requiring that the

boson tadpole (which includes contributions from both boson and fermion loops as

we have described above) vanish. in this scheme, the counterterm completely cancels

the terms we have subtracted from eq. (4.30), so there is nothing to add back in. in

the sine-gordon theory, this scheme also makes the physical mass of the boson equal

to m, while in the 4 theory, there is a one-loop correction to the physical mass of

37

the boson from the diagram with two three-boson vertices, giving a physical mass
of m  
4m3 [9]. for us it is more important to guarantee that the tadpole graphs
vanish, assuring us that we have chosen the correct vacuum for the theory, than to

have the physical mass equal to the lagrangian parameter m; for the sine-gordon

case we happen to be able to do both at once. furthermore, such renormalization

conditions can be applied uniformly to arbitrary u().

thus the eect of regularization and renormalization in our renormalization scheme

is to subtract

(1)(k) = (1)

b (k)  (1)

f (k) =

m

(4.33)

from the dierence of the boson and fermion phase shifts, giving

for both the kink and sine-gordon soliton. this result agrees with [9] and [14], and

disagrees with [12], [8], [13], and [15]. as pointed out in [9], in the case of the sine-

gordon soliton, it also agrees with the result obtained from the yang-baxter equation

assuming the factorization of the s-matrix [17].

we note that in the end this result depended only on eq. (4.16) and its impli-

cations for levinsons theorem. thus, since eq. (4.16) holds in general for antisym-

metric soliton solutions, eq. (4.34) gives the one-loop correction to the energy in our

renormalization scheme of any supersymmetric soliton that is antisymmetric under

reection.

4.3 supersymmetry algebra and the central charge

our second application of the apparatus we have developed is to compute the one-loop

quantum correction to the central charge in the presence of the kink or sine-gordon

38

soliton.

first we summarize the supersymmetry algebra. we dene

q =

(1  i1)

2

m2

 z (/ + iu)0 dx =

m2

 z ( + (  u)) dx

(4.35)

where  = 1i1
relations, we have

2  and q = 1i1

2 q. using the canonical equal-time (anti)commutation

m2
 {i(x), (y)} = i(x  y)
[(x), (y)] = i(x  y)

m2


(4.36)

where  =  is the momentum conjugate to  and all other (anti)commutators vanish.

the supersymmetry algebra is

{q, q} = 2h  2z

{q+, q} = 2p,

(4.37)

where h, p , and z are given classically by

h =

p =

z =

m2

m2

 z (cid:18) +
 z u dx.

(++ + 


)(cid:19) dx

i
2



) + 2iu+(cid:17) dx

(4.38)

it is easy to check that h is the same hamiltonian as would be determined canonically

from eq. (4.1).

at the classical level, using eq. (4.2),

hcl =

m2

2 z (cid:16)0(x)2 + u(0)2(cid:17) dx = 

m2

 z u(0(x))0(x) = zcl,

(4.39)

for the soliton and antisoliton respectively.

the hermiticity of q gives the bps bound on the expectation values of h and

39

z in any quantum state:

hhi  |hzi| .

(4.40)

classically, the values of h and |z| are equal so this bound is saturated. we have
found a negative correction to h at one-loop, so if there is no correction to z, eq. (4.40)

will be violated.

to unambiguously compute the corrections to the central charge for a soliton,

it is easier to consider corrections to q2

+ = h + z, which is zero classically (for the

antisoliton we should consider q2

 = h+z). one reason to consider q2

+ rather than h

and z separately is that this quantity is nite and independent of the renormalization

scheme. using eq. (4.31) and eq. (4.32) we see explicitly that the contribution from

the counterterm cancels:

hct = cz u(0)u(0) dx = cz u(0)0 dx = zct

(4.41)

(and we only need consider the tree-level contribution since the counterterm coecient

c is already order 0).

next we expand (x) = 0(x) + (x), where the soliton solution 0 is an ordinary

real function of x. neglecting terms of order 3 and higher (which give higher-loop

corrections), we obtain

hh + zi =

where hi denotes expectation value in the classical soliton background.

to evaluate this expression, we decompose the elds  and  using creation and

annihilation operators for the small oscillations around 0. the small oscillation

modes will be given in terms of the eigenmodes of the bosonic potentials v(x) and
 ). for any mode k(x) of v(x) with nonzero energy k = k2 + m2,
v(x) = 1

we note that the integral over k also includes discrete contributions from the bound

states (which correspond to imaginary values of k). these are understood to give

discrete contributions to the results that follow (with dirac delta functions replaced

by kronecker delta functions appropriately). however, we have explicitly indicated

the contribution from the bound states at  = 0 following [18].

we normalize the wavefunctions k such that

z dk

and the bps bound remains saturated.
(if we instead considered an antisoliton,
we would nd the same result for hq2
i  = hh  zi , with the roles of + and
 reversed.) our result disagrees with [9] and [15], which claim that there is no
correction to the central charge at one loop in this renormalization scheme. we note

that this result did not depend on any specic properties of u, so it holds for any

supersymmetric soliton satisfying eq. (4.2).

the second line of eq. (4.50) is simply the unregulated fermionic contribution to

the energy, and is explicitly equal to minus the average of the contributions from
the bosonic potentials v and v, in agreement with what we found above. as a

42

nal consistency check, we recalculate the full one-loop correction to the energy and

central charge using our expansion in terms of quantum elds. for h we obtain,

again neglecting 3 terms,

h = hhi  hcl

these results enable us to verify that eq. (4.51) is in agreement with eq. (4.34).

in the exact same way, we can calculate the correction to z directly. we start from

(4.58)

another work [20] has explained the dierence between our result for the central

charge and the result obtained in ref. [9] and predecessors. the earlier works found

z = 0 based on an argument that involves direct manipulation of the z operator.

however, ref. [20] showed that manipulations of this type are only valid if the operator

is augmented with an anomalous correction of order h.

we have systematically avoided the questionable manipulations that would have

led to z = 0 by computing only matrix elements, where we have the phase shift

formalism available to guide us. first we developed an unambiguous renormaliza-

tion procedure for h based on physical quantities. classical bps saturation denes

the operator z at tree level. once we have xed a renormalization scheme in our

computation of h, the expectation value of z (or any other physical quantity) is

determined. we then carried out the one-loop computation of z exactly in parallel

44

to the computation of h so that no new ambiguities could arise, and found that bps

saturation is maintained at one loop, as conrmed in ref. [20]. our use of levinsons

theorem and the born approximation also prevented the appearance of the spurious

linear divergences found in ref. [9].

thus we consistently included the eects of the svv anomaly in both h and

z, though of course we found only a particular matrix element instead of the full

operator. however, by working in the continuum (without boundaries), we avoided

the diculties that ref. [20] faced in separating the unphysical contributions at the

boundaries from the physical eects localized at the soliton.

chapter 5

scalars in three dimensions

having fully analyzed models in one dimension, we now turn to three dimensions.

we will continue to consider models with spherical symmetry, so that we can use a

partial wave decomposition. thus, in addition to an integral over k, we will also have

a sum over  to consider. on the other hand, the subtleties of the symmetric channel

in one dimension will be absent. theories in three dimensions will also have stronger

divergences than we found in one dimension. thus we will have to subtract more born

terms and add back in more corresponding diagrams. however, since all the theories

we will consider are renormalizable, only a nite number of born subtractions will

be required. we will again begin with a scalar model, but our techniques will easily

generalize to include fermions.

5.1 formalism

we consider a renormalizable eld theory with a real scalar eld  coupled to a
charged scalar . we take the classical potential v ()  (2  v2)2, and  acquires
a mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking. at the quantum level we put aside
the  self-couplings and consider only the eects of the  interactions. we further
restrict ourselves to o(h) eects in the quantum theory, which correspond to one-loop
diagrams.

46

our model is dened by the classical action

()2 


4!

(2  v2)2 +   g2

+a()2  b(2  v2)  c(2  v2)2 (cid:27) ,

where we have separated out the three counterterms necessary for renormalization

and written them in a convenient form. at one-loop order in , these are the only

counterterms required.

we quantize around the classical vacuum  = v and dene h =   v, so that

s[h, ] = z d4x( 1

m2
8v2 (h2 + 2vh)2  g(h2 + 2vh)

+  m 2
+a(h)2  b(h2 + 2hv)  c(h2 + 2hv)2 (cid:27)
where m = gv is the  mass and m2 = v2/3 is the h mass.

the one-loop quantum eective action for h is obtained by integrating out 

to leading order in h. we are interested in time-independent eld congurations
h = h(~x), for which the eective action yields an eective energy e[h] that has three
parts:

e[h] = ecl[h] + ect[h] + e[h] ,

where ecl[h] is the classical energy of h,
ecl[h] = z d3x ( 1
ect[h] is the counterterm contribution,

2|~h|2 +

m2

8v2 (h2 + 2vh)2) ,

ect[h] = z d3xna|~h|2 + b(h2 + 2hv) + c(h2 + 2hv)2o ,

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

and e[h] is the one-loop quantum contribution from . ect[h] and e[h] are divergent,
but we will see explicitly that these divergences cancel for any conguration h(~x).

47

figure 5-1: one-loop diagrams.

we x the counterterms by applying renormalization conditions in the perturba-

tive sector of the theory. having done so, we have dened the theory for all h(~x). we

choose the on-shell renormalization conditions

1 = 0, 2(m2) = 0,

and

where 1 and 2(p2) are the one- and two-point functions arising only from the loop

and counterterms as seen in fig. 5-1. we denote the one-loop diagrams with one

insertion by  and with two insertions by (p2), and nd

1 = 2vg + 2vb ,

2(p2) = (2vg)2(p2) + g + b + (2v)2c + ap2 .

the renormalization conditions eq.(5.4) then yield

a = (2vg)2(m2) , b = g , c = g2(m2(m2)  (m2)) ,

(5.7)

which we then substitute into the counterterm energy, eq. (5.3).

now we consider the calculation of e[h]. this energy is the sum over zero point

48

energies, 1

2h, of the modes of  in the presence of h(~x),

e[h] = x

k[h]

(5.8)

where k are the positive square roots of the eigenvalues of the small oscillations

hamiltonian,

(cid:16)~2 + m 2 + g(h2 + 2vh)(cid:17) k = 2

k

(5.9)

the fact that  is complex accounts for the absence of 1

2 in eq. (5.8).

e is highly divergent. however our model is renormalizable and therefore the
counterterms xed in the presence of the trivial h must cancel all divergences in e.
rather than attempt to regulate the divergent sum in eq. (5.8) directly, we study

the density of states that denes the sum. we can isolate the terms that lead to
divergences in e and renormalize them using conventional methods. thus our task
is to generalize the construction of eq. (2.7) to this case.

for xed h(~x) the spectrum of h given in eq. (5.9) consists of a nite number

(possibly zero) of normalizable bound states and a continuum beginning at m 2, pa-
rameterized by k, with e(k) = +k2 + m 2. furthermore, h depends on h only
through the combination

 = h2 + 2hv ,

(5.10)

so we can consider e to be a functional of . we restrict ourselves to spherically
symmetric h. then

e[] = xj

(5.11)

where (k) is the density of states in k in the th partial wave and the ej are the

divergent. furthermore

(k) = free

(5.12)

where (k) is the usual scattering phase shift for the th partial wave, and free



(k) is

49

the free (g = 0) density of states. this relationship between the density of states and

the derivative of the phase shift is shown for example in [14].

at the outset, we subtract free(k) from the density of states since we wish to
compare e[] to e[0]. viewing e[] as the sum of one loop diagrams, we see that
only the diagrams with one or two insertions of g are divergent. a diagram with n

insertions corresponds to the nth term in the born expansion, so all possible diver-

gences can be eliminated by subtracting the rst and second born approximations

from the phase shifts that determine the density of states. standard methods allow

us to construct the born approximation for the phase shifts [6], which is a power

series in the potential g.

we dene the combination

(k)  (k)  (1)

 (k)  (2)

 (k) ,

(5.13)

where (1)

 (k) and (2)

 (k) are the rst and second born approximations to l(k). we

(5.15)

and likewise for h(~p). both h and  are real and depend only on q  |~p| for spherically
symmetric h. we have subtracted out the order g and g2 contributions by using
(k) instead of (k), and added them back in by using their explicit diagrammatic
representation in terms of the divergent constant  and the divergent function (p2).

we can now combine e and ect and obtain a nite result:

q2dq

(5.17)

 is log divergent, but both {(q2)  (m2)} and  are nite, so 2[h] is nite as
well.

each term in the born approximation to the phase shift goes to zero at k = 0, so
by levinsons theorem (0) = (0) = n where n is the number of bound states
with angular momentum . as k  , (k) falls o like 1
 (k) falls o like 1
k ,
and (2)
k2 . since the born approximation becomes exact at large k,
(k) falls like 1

convergent. the second subtraction makes the -sum convergent. we are then free

in this expression we see that each bound state contributes its binding energy, ejm,
so that the energy varies smoothly as we strengthen h and bind more states.

5.2 calculational methods

in this section we describe the method that allows us to construct e[h] as a functional

terms in eq. (5.18) in turn. the classical contribution to the action is evaluated

directly by substitution into eq. (5.2). 2[h] of eq. (5.17) is obtained from a feynman

we solve eq. (5.24) numerically, integrating from r =  to r = 0 with (k,) =
(k,) = 0, to get the exact phase shifts. to get the born approximation to , we
solve the equation iteratively, writing  = g1 + g22 + . . ., where 1 satises

(r) = 0

 i2  2ikp(kr)2 + 2(1)2 = 0.

(5.26)

(5.27)

we can solve eciently for 1 and 2 simultaneously by combining these two equa-

tions into a coupled dierential equation for the vector (1, 2). this method is

much faster than calculating the born terms directly as iterated integrals in r and

will generalize easily to a theory requiring higher-order counterterms.

having found the phase shifts, we then use levinsons theorem to count bound

states. we then nd the energies of these bound states by using a shooting method to

solve the corresponding eigenvalue equation. we use the eective range approximation

[6] to calculate the phase shift and bound state energy near the threshold for forming

an s-wave bound state.

5.3 results

for the model at hand, we calculated the energy e[h] for a two-parameter (d and w)
family of gaussian backgrounds

h(r) = dver2v2/2w2

.

(5.28)

in fig. 5-2, we show results which are representative of our ndings in general. we

plot the energy of congurations with xed d = 1 as a function of w, for g = 1, 2, 4, 8

(from top to bottom). we note that to this order, for g = 8 the vacuum is unstable

to the formation of large  = 0 regions.

to explore whether the charged scalar forms a non-topological soliton in a given 
background, we add to e[h] the energy of a valence  particle in the lowest bound
state. we then compare this total energy to m, the energy of the  particle in a at

background, to see if the soliton is favored. this is the scalar model analog of t-quark

bag formation.

for xed g and m, we varied h looking for bound states with energy e such that
e +e[h] < m. however, for those values of g and m where we did nd such solutions,
we always found that by increasing w, we could make e[h] < 0, so that the vacuum is
unstable, as we pointed out above in the case of g = 8 in fig. 5-2. thus we nd that

if we stay in the g, m parameter region where the vacuum is stable, the minimum is

at h = 0, so there are no nontopological solitons.

although we did not nd a non-trivial solution at one-loop order in this simple

model, our calculation demonstrates the practicality of our method in three dimen-

sions. we can eectively characterize and search the space of eld congurations,

h(r), while holding the renormalized parameters of the theory xed. the same meth-

ods can be used to study solitons in theories with richer structure in three dimensions.

5.4 derivative expansion

our results are exact to one-loop order. the derivative expansion, which is often

applied to problems of this sort, should be accurate for slowly varying h(r). we

found it useful to compare our results with the derivative expansion for two reasons:

rst, we can determine the range of validity (in d and w) of the derivative expansion;

and second, where the derivative expansion is expected to be valid, it provides a check

on the accuracy of our numerical work and c++ programming. where expected, the

two calculations did agree to the precision we specied (1 %).

in our model, the rst two terms in the derivative expansion of the one-loop

eective lagrangian can be calculated to be

where z = g/m 2 = (h2 + 2hv)/v2,  and  are cuto-dependent constants, and
lct is the same counterterm lagrangian as we used in sec. 2. for 4 scalar eld
theory a similar result was rst derived in [5]. the last term above is proportional

to (h)2, and is completely cancelled by a nite counterterm that implements the

renormalization prescription of sec. 2. in this prescription, counterterms also cancel
the z and z2 terms above. thus the o(p2) derivative expansion for the eective
energy, to be compared with the phase shift expression for e[h], is

ede[h] = z d3x

(5.30)

the results of the comparison with the phase shift method can be seen in fig. 5-3

for d = 0.25, and g = 4. a similar pattern holds in general for other values of both

d and g. as the width becomes larger, the two results merge. this is as expected,

since it is for large widths, and thus small gradients, that we expect the derivative

to zero, and the fact that the plot tends to 1 simply indicates that the derivative

fermions in three dimensions

it is now an easy matter to extend these three dimensional results to fermions. we

continue to consider a classical background , now coupled to a dirac fermion . our

lagrangian becomes

the small oscillations are now given by the dirac equation,

0(cid:16)iii + m + gh(cid:17) k = k

(6.1)

(6.2)

where h =  v and m = gv. we will continue to work with a symmetric background
h, so we can decompose our small oscillations into channels according to angular

momentum.

letting i = 0i and  = 0, we will work in the basis

(6.3)

where the k are the standard pauli matrices. we dene the operator

q = (~  ~l)

(6.4)

where ~l = ~r ~p. this operator commutes with the hamiltonian, and is related to the
total angular momentum operator ~j = ~l + 1
4. we can thus restrict
to states with a particular eigenvalue q of the operator q, with q = 1,2,3 . . ..
we also introduce the radial momentum operator

where  = k2 + m2. thus the free solutions for f and g will be spherical harmonics
j(kr), with  equal to the orbital angular momentum of the spherical harmonic that

the radial function multiplies in eq. (6.7) or eq. (6.8).

in each channel, it is convenient to work with the full second-order equation that

we obtain by squaring the dirac equation. any solution to the dirac equation must

solve this equation as well, and if we choose our boundary conditions so that the dirac

equation is solved, a solution to the second-order equation will automatically solve the

dirac equation. to facilitate our numerical computation, we will focus on the upper
component, since its equation will involve the quantity  + m rather than   m, and
the former is easier to deal with numerically at small k. (the small k limit is also

the nonrelativistic limit, and in this limit the upper component is large compared

to the lower component, which makes it easier to deal with numerically; if we were

investigating negative energy solutions it would be easier to use the lower component.)

we will therefore label our channels by parity (as above) and by  = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the

orbital angular momentum of the upper component. the total spin j is then equal

to  + 1

2 for positive parity and   1

2 for negative parity. (only positive parity exists

for  = 0.)

 = h2 + 2hv.

again, the phase shift is given by

 (k) = 2 re  (k, 0).

(6.13)

(6.14)

we also have stronger divergences than in the bosonic case, so we must subtract the

rst four terms in the born approximation and add them back in as diagrams. as

a result, the numerical computation is somewhat more complicated; nonetheless, the

basic method is the same: we iterate the dierential equations for the phase shifts to

obtain the born approximations, which again cancel the divergences at large k and

 (though for small k and , the born approximation may deviate widely from the

exact phase shift). as in the boson model, the born approximations to the phase

shift go to zero at k = 0, while the exact phase shifts go to  times the number of

bound states in that channel. and, as we would expect, there is an overall fermi

minus sign in front of the entire result.

this computation adds the full casimir energy to the computation of [22]; as indi-

cated above, to consistently compute the eect of the shift in the valence quark level

requires that we include the casimir energy as well. however, in this model, although

the quantitative results are modied, the qualitative conclusions for moderate values

of g are unchanged.

an interesting generalization of this model is to add isospin, making the back-

ground eld into a complex 2-component vector. we can then construct hedgehog

congurations that have nontrivial topology. these congurations are no longer cp

invariant. in particular, they can have spectral asymmetry, which is reected by a

fermion level crossing during the process of adiabatically constructing the congura-

tion from the trivial vacuum. if a level crossing does occur, the conguration carries

fermion number and we do not need to ll an energy level at all. even if a level

crossing does not occur, the level that is heading toward zero is often strongly bound

60

and thus costs only a small amount of energy.

to consider congurations that violate cp , we must address the question of
whether to sum the quantity  1
2|| over all modes or the quantity  the negative
modes. (if c or cp is not broken, the two methods give the same answer.) the for-

mer shows more consistency with the boson computation, while the latter is what one

would expect from a dirac sea picture, since the negative modes are the ones that are

lled. the rst method is correct. one can prove this formally [21], but here we will

show it via a simple example, ordinary qed. consider qed with a massive fermion,

and imagine turning on a very weak, slowly varying electric eld. to leading order

in the coupling, this eld will shift both positive and negative energy levels in the

same direction, with corresponding particle and antiparticle states being shifted by

the same amount. if we were to sum only the shifts in the negative energy levels, we

would nd a divergent result at the leading order in the born approximation. how-

ever, there is no available counterterm to cancel this innity. if instead we calculate

the shift summing all of the levels, to rst order we simply get zero, since the shifts in

the particle states cancel against the shift in the antiparticle states. this result agrees

with the loop calculation, where we nd that the leading contribution is identically

zero, with no contribution from the counterterm. (note that this result is dierent

from what we nd to leading order for scalar eld.

in that case, the particle and

antiparticle levels move toward zero, and both sums give the same divergent result.

however, in this case there is a counterterm available to cancel out this divergence.)

a hedgehog conguration breaks rotational invariance, but we can choose it to

stay within the spherical ansatz, so that it is invariant under grand spin (simultaneous

rotations in physical space and isospin space). we decompose the spectrum into a

sum over channels labeled by their grand spin and their parity. each channel now

has two coupled degrees of freedom instead of one, but still can be described by a

second-order (matrix) dierential equation. summing the two eigenphases gives us

the total contribution to the density of states from that channel. this matrix equa-

tion must also be iterated through fourth order to obtain the born approximations

corresponding to the divergent diagrams.

61

calculation in this generalized model in principle requires no further modications

to the framework presented above. however, there are practical diculties associated

with the increased computational complexity. even in the model without isospin, the

third- and fourth- order diagrams involve multidimensional integrals over external

momenta and feynman parameters. one possible simplication is to use a toy

boson model with the same divergence structure as the third- and fourth-order dia-

grams. if chosen properly, this model will exhibit the same local at second order as

the fermions have at third and fourth order, so subtracting its second-order phase

shifts and adding back in its second-order diagram (in the fermionic renormalization

scheme, of course) can regulate the theory in a computationally simpler way. such a

manipulation is possible only because the divergences are simple, local functions of

the background eld; the nite parts of the bosonic diagram will of course be very dif-

ferent from the nite parts of the fermionic diagrams. however, because we add back

in everything we have subtracted, using counterterms xed in the fermion theory, we

have not changed the nal answer. work is underway on this model [23].

62

chapter 7

conclusions

we have seen that the continuum density of states formalism has allowed us to apply

the powerful calculational tools of quantum mechanics  phase shifts, born approx-

imations and levinsons theorem  to nontrivial problems in quantum eld theory.

these formal tools provide the robust framework we need to do unambiguous cal-

culations. without them, we could have easily missed the subtleties of bosonic and

fermionic spectra that we have seen above, and such a mistake would lead to a dras-

tic change in the end result. such errors are intolerable because of their theoretical

consequences, as in the case of the saturation of the bps bound in 1+1 dimensional

supersymmetric theories, and because of their phenomenological consequences, as in

the case of heavy quark bags in the standard model.

one can envision many other applications of this work. as mentioned above,

the most immediate is to include fermions coupled to scalars with isospin in the

spherical ansatz. one could also imagine adding gauge elds to such a model, to

bring it still closer to the real standard model. one could then apply these methods

to other gauge theory solitons, such as t hooft-polyakov monopoles or ux tubes in

superconductors. it would also be interesting to see if one could use these techniques

to compute quantum corrections to the action of instantons.

 . the basic technique will be to dene

so that we can rewrite eq. (1) as

(cid:16)aa  2m2(cid:17) (x) = k2(x) = (cid:16)a+1a+1  ( + 1)2m2(cid:17) (x).

(3)

(4)

we can then connect the solutions for a given  with those for  1 by observing that
eq. (4) implies that if (x) is an eigenstate in the potential v1, then (x) = a (x)

64

is an eigenstate in the potential v with the same eigenvalue k2. thus we have

 (x) = a(x)
(x) = a (x)

(5)

with  = k2 + l2m2. thus the spectra of v and v1 are identical, except that

the spectrum of v might contain additional states annihilated by a. indeed, there
is exactly one such state, at k2 = 2m2 (which becomes the zero mode of the
corresponding soliton).

by iterating this process, we arrive at  = 0, which is a free particle. since we

know how to solve that problem completely, we can go backwards and solve for any v

simply by applying raising operators and at each step solving for the one additional

zero mode.

for example, for  = 1 we start with the free scattering states eikx and apply a1,

(12)

for j = 0, . . . , . the state at k2 = 0 is a half-bound state, right at threshold, which
goes to a constant as x  . this state is given by acting with our raising operators
on the threshold state in the free case, which is just a constant wavefunction. thus

for  = 1 we nd

we see that in both cases, these states are the k  0 limit of the scattering states,
and have the property that they go to a constant (rather than a straight line of some
nonzero slope) as x  .

66

since v is symmetric, we can separate the spectrum of wavefunctions into sym-

metric and antisymmetric channels. the symmetry of the bound states will alternate,

with the lowest energy bound state being symmetric. the phase shift can also be de-

composed into contributions from the two channels, with

(k) = s

that the scattering is reectionless is equivalent to

s

(15)

where na

 are the numbers of antisymmetric and symmetric bound states

threshold states are essential in reconciling eq. (16) with eq. (17).

appendix b: phase shifts in

arbitrary dimensions

in this section we demonstrate explicitly the link between the leading born approxi-

mation to the phase shifts and tadpole diagrams by computing both in dimensional

regularization. we consider only the bose case for simplicity.

in n spatial dimensions, we consider the bosonic small oscillations in partial wave
 with wave number k in the presence of a ndimensionally spherically symmetric
bosonic potential v (x). as in three dimensions, we can separate variables and obtain

a dierential for the wavefunction (r) in partial waves . also as in three dimensions,

it is convenient to use a rescaled wavefunction u = r

this is the same equation as in three dimensions except that the eigenvalue of the
2mm  has been generalized from ( + 1) to ( + n  2).
the degeneracy factor for this partial wave (i.e. the dimension of this representa-

tion of the rotation group, which gives the generalization of 2+1 in three dimensions)

is the dimension of the space of symmetric tensors with  indices that each run from

1 to n with all traces (contractions) removed. working out the combinatorics gives

and

 (n + 1) = n!

(20)

for a fuller derivation of eq. (18) and eq. (19) see for example appendix b of [24].

as we have seen above, the tadpole graph requires the external momentum to be

equal to zero. thus we should expect that both the leading born approximation and

the tadpole graph will depend only on the spatial average of the potential (its p = 0

component),

where we have used levinsons theorem as in eq. (2.10). this manipulation was not

necessary in our calculations in three dimensions since we did not have any singular-

ities at k = 0, but it still would have been a perfectly valid thing to do; all the born
approximations vanish at both k = 0 and k = . however, to calculate in arbitrary
dimensions we will need to perform the  sum rst. thus, to avoid the same infrared

singularities we saw in one dimension, we again have used levinsons theorem to add

a total derivative to the unregulated integral. as a result, our analysis of arbitrary

dimensions will provide further evidence that the correct form of the unregulated sum

is indeed that of eq. (2.10).

using the bessel function identity

(2q + 2)(2q +   1)!

!

jq+(z)2 =



x=0

we can explicitly do the sum over , giving

(2q)!

(q!)2 (cid:18)z

2(cid:19)2q

e (1) =

n

hv i
2 (cid:16) n

2(cid:17) z 

0

(  m)(n  2)kn3 dk.

(24)

(25)

the k integral can be calculated near n = 1

2 and then analytically continued, giving

z 

0

(  m)kn3 dk = 

mn1

(cid:18)1  n

2 (cid:19) (cid:18)n  2
2 (cid:19)

and so we nd

e (1) = hv i

n+1

(cid:18)1  n

2 (cid:19) mn1

(26)

(27)

in agreement with what we obtain using standard dimensional regularization of the

tadpole diagram in n + 1 space-time dimensions.
