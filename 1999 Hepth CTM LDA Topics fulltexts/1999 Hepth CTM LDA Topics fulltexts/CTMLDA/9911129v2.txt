closed form eective conformal anomaly actions in d4

abstract

i present, in any d4, closed-form type b conformal anomaly eective actions incorporating
the logarithmic scaling cuto dependence that generates these anomalies. their construction
is based on a novel class of weyl-invariant tensor operators. the only known type a actions
in d4 are extensions of the polyakov integral in d=2; despite contrary appearances, we show
that their nonlocality does not conict with general anomaly requirements. they are, however,
physically unsatisfactory, prompting a brief attempt at better versions.

introduction

conformal (weyl) anomalies reect the loss of classical scale invariance caused by unavoidable
regularization of conformally invariant matter closed loops. their properties, in all dimensions,
are by now well understood.
in particular [1] there are two, explicitly known, types that can
be conveniently expressed in terms of an external metric g coupled to the matter. these local
gravitational scalar densities a(g) dier in their separate ir/uv origins and in their behavior
under weyl variations. both can be represented as responses of (nonunique) nonlocal eective
actions i[g ] under metric conformal variations

g = 2(x)g .

the built-in integrability condition on variations of these anomalies a(x)  i[g ]/(x),

a(x)/(x) = 2i/(x)(x) = a(x)/(x) ,

(1)

(2)

serves as a useful check on candidate as and on allowed forms of the type a actions; type b
anomalies, are necessarily weyl-invariant, satisfying (2) trivially.

the origin of the anomalies in closed loop graphs imposes constraints on the actions dimen-
sionality and nonlocality. these seem to clash with the only known closed form actions, essentially
the obvious d4 generalizations of the d=2 polyakov action in both cases (type b starts at d=4).
on the other hand, since eective actions are not unique  nonlocal weyl invariant dimensionless
gravitational functionals will be exhibited  some choices will be better behaved physically than
others, reecting more accurately the underlying loop properties or being obtainable through inte-
grating out a compensating eld in an action that is physically acceptable, in particular ghost-free.

i will present here new complete closed form type b actions that correctly reect their cuto
dependence and origins. their construction is based on new tensor dierential operators (general-
izing existing scalar ones) that are conformal invariant when acting on weyl-like tensors. for the
existing type a actions, we will resolve the paradox that their explicit 22 nonlocalities violate the
single pole (21) behavior at lowest order about at space required by dimensionality and general

anomaly analysis. quite apart from the above problems, however, they have long been known
[2, 1], to be unsatisfactory in e.g., long-distance behavior, failing to correctly represent the under-
lying stress tensor correlators. while i have not succeeded in constructing more suitable actions
beyond the lowest order one given in [1], some remarks on this open problem are appended.

2 type b

the type b anomalies ab have two hallmarks: they arise from the uv behavior of the underlying
matter loops, with consequent logarithmic cuto dependence, and are themselves weyl invariant.
they only start at d=4, being in fact the rst anomalies discovered there [3]; the unique local d=4
conformal invariant is the square of the weyl tensor,

ab  g tr c 2 ,

ab(x)/(x)  0 .

(3)

the number of independent ab rises rapidly with dimension; for example there are [4] three
varieties at d=6: two independent index traces of g c 3 and a third of the schematic form
g trc(2 + r)c. an eective d=4 action that reects the required logarithmic behavior was
already introduced in [3] at lowest, cubic, order in an expansion about at space, h  g   :
(4)

b  z d4x tr c ln(2/2)c + o(h4) ,
i 4

each c and 2 being eectively o(h), since the quadratic part is weyl invariant. while not strictly
correct, this approximation reproduced some of the desired scaling characteristics, including the
logarithmic dependence on the cuto  of the closed loops. what we really want of course is to
retain that behavior, but with 2 replaced by an argument  that produces the proper variation
 ln  =  to all orders;  must be a scalar (covariance forbids densities from being arguments of
logs) and of dimension 4, to bring in a 4. the problem of obtaining a physical eective action ib
thus reduces to nding dimension 4 operators 4 that, at least when acting on a specic tensorial
class z such as scalar or 4-tensors, are themselves weyl invariant, ( 4)z = 0. one such operator
has long been know and indeed underlies the type a construction to be discussed in sec. 3: the
self-adjoint paneitz (scalar density) operator [5] acting on scalars,

p = g[22 + 2d(r  1

3 g r)d ] .

(5)

it is the unique d=4 generalization of the d=2 invariant 2  g 2; its extra terms complete
the merely constant-scale invariant g 22. unfortunately, because it acts on scalars, p is useless

here:

b  z d4xg ln(p /g 4)tr c 2
i 4

(6)

is a total divergence, with vanishing variation.

from the above lesson, it is clear that we must abandon invariant s acting on scalars
and instead seek one that begins at d=4 and acts invariantly on 4-tensors t , ( )t = 0. more
specically, it suces that  be invariant when acting on the weyl tensor, for concreteness in its
weyl invariant c 
 index conguration, and to reproduce the latters tensorial rank and algebraic
properties:

c 

  ( c)

    

 c 

   .

(7)

preserving constant scale invariance already requires  (like p) to be a 4th derivative tensor
density; so if  obeys ( )c = 0, it will follow that

 c = 0 ,

( 

c) = 0 ,

[

where the intermediate 1/g factors must be included to keep subsequent  acting on tensors
rather than on densities. the underlying physics clearly demands that such a  exist, and it has
now indeed been found [6]; while its form is unfamiliar (e.g., it has no 22 part at all), it is only
necessary for our purposes to know that it exists since its only role is to allow for the presence of

[ln( 4/4g )c]

tail, since it is the density 4 that is weyl invariant, any power in the logs expansion, ( 1

correctly avoids having 4 act on densities and only the outer 1/g factor contributes in each

term. hence we may indeed conclude from (10a) that

the various possible ab(x) in higher dimension will similarly be expressible in terms of the corre-
sponding d, which are also sure to exist:

b/ = g c 2 .

where z is the rest of the local invariant in question, e.g., z  (cc) or c(2 + r) in d=6 and
similarly for d>6.

i close this section with an object lesson on ambiguities in eective actions; it is an apt
introduction to the type a problem, being modeled on the only closed form action known there
and being even more unphysical for type b (because it totally violates the logarithmic dependences)
p ), where e4 is
than for type a. it is based on the fact that (as explained below) the quantity ( e41
essentially the d=4 euler invariant, weyl transforms as a compensator eld (21). consequently [7],

b = z d4x e41
i 4

p (g c 2) ,

 i 4

b/ = g c 2 .

(12)

note the complete contrast between the actions (9) and (12), even though both succeed in the
limited requirement of correctly yielding ab under weyl variation.

3 type a

to understand this family, it is useful to review d=2, where type a is the only possible anomaly.
by power counting, the anomaly a2(x) must have dimension 2; the only local dieo-invariant is
the euler density e2(x), a total divergence:

a2(x) = g r(x) = 1

2 g  r   e2(x) .

(13)

3

unlike type b, this quantity is not weyl invariant; rather e2(x)  2g 2. the indicated weyl
variation of a2 guarantees the integrability condition:

e2(x)/(x) = 2g 22(x  x) = e2(x)/(x) .

(14)

as already noted, the scalar density operator 2  g 2 is weyl invariant at d=2, when (and

only when) acting on a scalar

2  [(g g ) ] = 0 .

hence the nonlocal scalar operator

(e2/2) = 2(x)

transforms like a weyl compensator eld, leading to the polyakov [8] construction,

i2 = 1

4 r d2x e21

2 e2 ,

i2/(x) = e2(x) .

clearly  p2, in accord with the power counting of the 2-point closed loop  (r d2p/p4)r2
l where
rl  (pph) are the linearized scalar curvatures representing external gravitons coupled to the
matter t : the underlying correlator, < t (p)t (p) >, is multiplied by h h and the four
factors of momentum in the < t t > numerator convert them to curvatures. however, this counting
is true only to leading order in h : while dressings of the curvatures from expanding (17) in
powers of h but keeping the at space 1
2 do indeed maintain the p2 overall behavior (as they
should diagrammatically since this is still eectively a 2-point function) expanding the denominator

h  g g   = (h  1

0 h  + ...)21
2  h) + ...

(18)

gives rise to increasing powers of p2, in total agreement with the diagrammatics; a 3-point closed
loop generically acquires another p2 from the extra propagator and so on for the n-point expansion.
indeed, the folklore that anomalies must have only a 21
0 nonlocality, applies only to their leading
terms. this fact will be essential in d=4. despite these seemingly unpleasant higher poles, the
polyakov action (unlike its d>2 extensions) is perfectly physical as attested by its derivability
through integrating out a physical ghostfree compensator elds action, i2[] = r d2x[ 1
2 2+e2];
it is also vouched for by being the covariantization of the matter loop integrals r d2xh < t t > h,

as noted above.

as shown in [1], the d=2 anomaly (13) extends uniquely to any d=2n: the same infrared

type is given by the euler density at d=2n,

a2n = e2n  1..2n1..2n

r1...r...2n/g ;

(19)

note that e2n and hence its variation vanishes identically in lower d (since the levicivita 1...2n
symbol does). integrability is always satised because e2n varies according to
2n (x)dd (x  x) =  e2n(x)/(x) .

e2n(x)/(x) = g

(20)

4

where g
2n is an identically conserved tensor (as it must be, since e2n and its variations are total
divergences); it is essentially the einstein tensor of the euler action at dimension 2(n-1). for
concreteness we will work in d=4, then indicate the generalization to arbitrary d. here, g
is of
course the true einstein tensor (that indeed vanishes at d=2) and e4  g (r2
 +r2) is
the usual gaussbonnet combination. it is therefore tempting to follow the form of the d=2 action
(17), in terms of the suitable generalization of 2, namely the paneitz operator (5) and replacing
e2 by e4. this was the proposal of [7], with the minor modication of using e4  e4 + 2
rather than e4, to achieve the extension of (16), to

3 g 2r

and therefore of (17) to

by the same reasoning as in d=2. since 2r itself derives from a local (and hence irrelevant,
removable) action,  1
e4, it eectively also varies into e4.

3g 2r, we see that while (22) literally varies into

the representation (22) presents a paradox: 1
p

0 ) pole, whose pres-
ence is incompatible with the leading, 3-point, function. just by momentum counting around a
matter loop with three external curvatures, the latters leading o(h3) term has to be 21
0 , and not
22
0 , nonlocal. to understand the conict in detail, rst simply expand the p of (5) in (22):

contains a double (22

20r) .

(23)

here curvatures are needed only to their linearized o(h) order and derivatives are also at space
ones; all corrections to those quantities either lead to o(h4) or are o(h3) but harmless,  21
0 . the
same is true of the unity part of the 1
expansion: the quadratic terms are the local r d4x r2,
4
the cubics are  r d4x[e421
0 r] where 21 is the o(h) part of 2; they are single-
pole. now pass to the correction term which seems to have a 24
0 . however, being linear, it
only multiplies the quadratics (20r)22
20r  r2, so it is 22
at worst. before proceeding
0
further, note two useful properties [1] of our cubic integrals: rst, the position of 21
among
0
the three factors is irrelevant; second, integration by parts rules are very useful, e.g., (for any s)

0 r + 21r21

0

r d4x s rr =  1

in (23) reduce to the form

2 r d4x s20r2. both are used implicitly below. the dangerous cubic terms

0 r, =  1
z d4xr,21

2 r r3/20 is obviously safe. this leaves the rst,
0 r 21

0 r, ,

(25)

which is certainly  22
0 as it stands. note that there is no dimensional contradiction: the extra
21
is compensated for by the extra  in the numerator, but these are not mutable into a 20
0
by parts integration as long as we write everything in terms of curvatures alone. this impasse
disappears by relaxing the latter requirement and expressing the ricci tensor in terms of its metric
denition,

2r = 20h  (2

h

 + ()) + h

, , r = 20h

  2

h .

(26)

5

the 20h term is manifestly  21
integration by parts. the result of a simple calculation yields the equality

0 ; the remaining ones also provide an additional 20, after

z d4x r,r, 22

0 r = 1

(27)

whose right side, although its rst term is irreducible to curvatures/20 is of course just as gauge-
invariant under h =  +  , r = 0 as the left, after using partial integration. these
steps demonstrate that the leading, h3, terms (23) have only a simple pole, which is all one can
demand of them on dimensional or general anomaly grounds. before proceeding to higher order,
it should be emphasized that the 21
0 nonlocality is irreducible, and cannot be removed even by
expressing all curvatures in terms of h . more important, their failure to have r r321
form is
not unavoidable, but rather symptomatic of their physical defects: that form has been achieved [1].

0

beyond leading order there will clearly appear higher and higher poles in the h -expansion
of 1
p . indeed, as explained previously, each successive additional vertex insertion into the loop
diagram involves an extra propagator and so, generically an (acceptable) extra power of 21
0 .
for higher d, the 2n will go as 2n, but again the leading, (n + 1)-point function must go as
r (d2np)/(p2)n+1  p2, and it will, by similar considerations as for d=4, with

ia = z d2nx e2n1

2n

e2n

(28)

and 2n  2n + .. , e2n  e2n + ... where the additional terms in n and e2n are of lower/higher
derivative order respectively, and as in d=2,4 with  e2n = 2n, 2n = 0.

the above rehabilitation of (22) in no way improves its problematic physical behavior. one
illustration of its problems is supplied by the unphysical nature of the compensating eld action
that generates it when the eld is integrated out:

ia[; g ] = z ddx[ 1

2 d +  ed] ,

i[ +  ; 2g ]/ = ed .

(29)

this means that for d>2, the  propagator becomes more and more ghostlike, with correspond-
ingly worse long-distance behavior associated to the higher powers 2n in d. this correlation is
unavoidable: since  must be dimensionless, its kinetic part has to be of d-derivative order. there
are of course an innite number of compensator actions, just as there are of purely gravitational
ones. an example of the former whose variation yields e4 is [7, 1]

ia[; g ] = z d4x[8e4 + g dd + 1

2

2()2 + ()2( )2] ,

(30)

each succeeding term correcting the residual variation of the previous ones; there is no kinetic 
term at all. examples of ambiguities in the gravitational actions are furnished by polynomials in

the dimensionless conformally invariant scalar building block x  g c 21

p , namely

iconf =



xm=0

an z d4xx m+1g c 2 .

(31)

each term begins at order h2(m+2), with corresponding poles  22(m+1).

6

what is clearly required at the purely gravitational action level is a way of nding (perhaps
from the expression given in [1]) the covariantization (without distorting its behavior) of the lowest

order r d4xhhh < t t t > action dictated by the actual loop structure. the goal would be to
generalize the d=2 action only by increasing the number of curvatures in the numerator, but
keeping the denominator of second order, in terms of new second-derivative tensor operators 
(not necessarily weyl invariant) that would permit fully covariant actions of the form

ia = z d4x g (rr)( 1

2 r) .

(32)

it may also be possible to obtain such actions by a descent procedure from conformal invariants in
the regularized, d=4-2 dimension.

4 summary

use of a novel class of tensorial conformal invariant operators has made possible compact closed
form expressions for type b eective actions in any dimension; these retain all the physical uv
characteristics of the underlying matter loop integrals from which they arise. by contrast the known
type a actions are (beyond d=2) far from reecting those origins. nevertheless, it was possible to
verify that, when properly reformulated, their leading terms have only single poles, as required by
dimension and general anomaly considerations and therefore bound to be fullled by any action
that yields the correct anomaly. given the ongoing popularity of type a, in problems ranging from
phonomenological gravitational actions to c-theorems and holography (for some recent work see
e.g., [9, 10] and references therein), improved versions, perhaps of the suggested form (32), of its
eective action are eminently worth nding.
