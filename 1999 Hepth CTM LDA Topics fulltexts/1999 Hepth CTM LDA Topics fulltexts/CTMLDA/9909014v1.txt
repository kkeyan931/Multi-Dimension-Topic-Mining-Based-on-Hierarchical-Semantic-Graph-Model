in the framework of a gauge invariant continuous and non perturbative regular-
ization scheme based on the smearing of point like interactions by means of cuto
functions, we show that the axial anomaly, though cuto independent depends of the
shape of the cuto functions.

1 introduction

since its discovery fty years ago [1], and its recognition as an intrinsic feature of the regu-
larization of gauge theories in qft [2, 3], the multiple properties of the axial anomaly were
extensively studied. as we know, if a subtracting regularization scheme is used in perturba-
tion theory, like for example the pauli-villars regularization [4], the axial anomaly is nite at
the one loop order, and its value is determined only once one has decided which symmetry
must be preserved. this is due to the fact that the integral associated to the triangular
feynman diagram is linear divergent, and hence its nite part becomes ambiguous because
it depends of the shift of the loop momentum integration variable [3]. it is in this sense
that jackiw [5] emphasized recently that the axial anomaly is an example which shows that
radiative corrections can be nite, but undetermined in qft. we will show in the framework
of qed that the undetermined nature of the axial anomaly gets stronger, if we use a contin-
uous and non-perturbative gauge invariant regularization based of the smearing of point like
interactions by means of cuto functions [6]. it comes out that at one loop order the form
of the axial anomaly is the standard one, but its strength will depend of the shape of the
cuto functions. in order to derive this result we will calculate directly the greens function

photons in momentum space starting from the regularized equations of motion of qed.

2 the divergence of the axial current

first of all we recall briey the main features of the non-perturbative regularization scheme
under consideration [6]. the regularized action is

s(, , a) = z dk (k)(cid:16)2

(n+2)! z dkdpd p (p)kn+2(k, p, p)(p) + sgauge,

(2.1)

where we have used the notation dp for dp/(2)4. the fermionic part of the action is the
sum of three terms and is regularized in a gauge invariant manner with the help of the cuto
functions i(k)  i(k2/2) whose asymptotic forms are

lim


i(k, ) = 1.

(2.2)

apart from the fact that in euclidian space the uv cuto functions must be positive and
rapid decreasing functions of the squared momenta their form is quite arbitrary. the rst
term which is the free electron kinetic term, gives the expression of the regularized free

1

electron propagator. the second term can be deduced from the standard non-regularized
electron photon interaction if we substitute the bare vertex  by
(pp)2 (cid:16)2

(p, p) = 3(p  p)h2(p)2(p)(p  p) + (pp)

(2.3)

1(p)p/  2

1(p)p/(cid:17)i .

by construction (p, p) contains a transverse part relative to the momentum p  p, which
is proportional to (p  p), where

the third term is dened by the kernel

(q) =   q/ q
q2 .

kn+2(k, p, p) = fn+2(p  k, k  p)2

1(k)k/ + i(n + 2)z dq 3(q)a(q)(q)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

with f0(p, q) = ((2)4)2 (p)(q). this term which describes an innite set of interactions
between two electrons and any number of photons (at least two), ensures that the vertices
of each n-photons amplitude are automatically constructed with the matrices (2.4) and
hence are transverse relative to the external photon momenta. finally sgauge is the sum of
the standard non-regularized photon kinetic term, of the gauge xing terms, and of a new
interaction which is quadratic in the photon elds. the new term which is proportional to the
ne structure constant  plays the role of a counterterm for the polarization operator which
shows a quadratic divergence in its transverse part in this regularization scheme. moreover
this term which is needed to x the value of the photon mass is non-renormalized by higher
order radiative corrections and can be absorbed in the photon propagator [6].

now we are able to calculate the divergence of the axial current. from the regularized
equation of motion hs(, , a)/ (p) + (p)i = 0 which is deduced from the translational
invariance of the regularized partition function of qed in presence of the external sources
,  and j for the electron and photon elds, we rst deduce the vacuum expectation
value of the electron eld in presence of the external sources. then, the derivation of this
latter expression with respect to the external sources, allows to express the greens function

(2.8)

where d(p) is the photon propagator. here we must stress that this result was obtained in
two steps. the rst term of (2.7), gives an expression similar to (2.8), but with the matrices
(k1) and (k2) replaced respectively by their non transverse counterparts (p+k1, p) and
(p + k1, p  q) 1. it is only when we take into account the second term of (2.7) that the non
transverse part of the vertices associated to the external photons lines cancel algebraically
after some judicious shift of integration variable. we dene the 1pi function 
associated
to the greens function (2.8) as

(k1, k2).

(2.9)

in the same way we dene also the 1pi function 
a(k1)a(k2)i, where j5(q) is the fourier transform of the pseudoscalar density 5. owing
to the transversality property of the matrices (2.4), we see directly by inspection, that the
amplitude 

(2.9) is transverse with regard to the external photons lines, i.e.

(2.10)

notice that due to the gauge invariant regularization used, the structure of the 1pi function
(2.9) which is represented by the triangular diagram of fig. 1 can also be deduced in a
straightforward manner, if we impose from the beginning the conditions (2.10).

1this expression converges formally to the standard non regularized triangle amplitude when the cuto

tends to innity.

is the axial current conserved as well? if we contract the two members of the relation

due to the properties of the 5 matrix, and those of the totally antisymmetric tensor ,

now some remarks have to be made. first from the property (2.2) we obtain the standard
linearly divergent piece of the amplitude (k1 + k2)
[7] which induced the axial anomaly
if we formally interchange the limit with the integral symbol. second, the pseudotensorial
structure of the rst term of (2.13) implies that the two regularized integrals of the right-hand
side of (2.13) do not vanish only because the product of the cuto functions is a function of
both the external momenta k1 and k2. therefore, if we parameterize respectively the shape
of the uv cuto functions 1(k)  (ak2/2) and 2(k)  (bk2/2) by two real numbers a
and b, it follows from dimensional analysis and from the requirement of lorentz invariance
that the right-hand side of (2.13) is given by

(k1 + k2)

5

(k1, k2) = i e2

22 c(a, b)k1k2 + 2m

5 (k1, k2),

(2.15)

where c(a, b) is a non vanishing real function. moreover if we rescale the parameters a and
b respectively by as and bs, where s is a real constant, it is easy to see from (2.13), (2.14)
and (2.15) that

c(as, bs) = c(a, b).

(2.16)

the fact that the function c(a, b) is an homogeneous function of zeroth order with respect to
the real variables a and b, shows that the strength of the axial anomaly (2.15) which is due to
the regularization of an evanescent operator is sensitive to the shape of the cuto functions,
but is independent of the rescaling of the cuto . next we will show in a particular case
that this is indeed the case.

for example we choose the following cuto functions

1(p) = ea

p2
2 ,

2(p) = eb

p2
2 ,

(2.17)

whose shape is parametrized by the real positive numbers a and b. in addition the signature
of the euclidian metric is chosen to be (1.  1.  1.  1). since the product of the cuto
functions is proportional to exp(p2(4b  6a)/2) and if we suppose that

2b > 3a,

(2.18)

the function d(p) can be substituted by 1/(p2  m2) without changing the result of the
integration and we can perform an analytical calculation 2. in this case we obtain for the
function c(a, b),

c(a, b) = b2a
4b6a .

(2.19)

it is worth to notice that, even though the latter result is constrained by the condition (2.18),
in the general case the real function c(a, b) is only determined by the fact that the functions

2 the integrals necessary to the calculation are listed in the appendix of [6].

5

i must be genuine cuto functions. thus the standard one loop value e2/(2)2 for the
coupling constant of the axial anomaly is recovered if the shapes of the cuto functions are
constrained by the equation

c(a, b) = 1.

(2.20)

is the result (2.15) specic to the regularization used? in order to answer to this question
we will study the structure of the regularized axial current.

this integral vanishes formally and is linear divergent when the cuto tends to innity. the
two divergences, which are in fact logarithmtic 3 cancel each other, and with the particular

if it is not regularized, the remaining part of i 
contains two kinds of uv divergences.
the rst divergence is linear and comes from the term containing the function g(p, k1, k2).
this divergence is reduced to the sum of a logarithmtic one, which is proportional to the
asymptotic form (k1  k2) r dp /p4, and of a constant which depends on the shape of
the cuto functions. the second divergence which comes from the expression in the brackets
is purely logarithmtic, and is induced by the asymptotic forms (k1  k2) r dp p2/p6 and
k1 r dp pp/p6 + k2 r dp pp/p6. because the two kind of divergences cancel
each other in the regularized form (3.4), it follows that the term i 
is indeed nite. finally
when the cuto functions (2.17) obey the condition (2.18) we get the analytical expression
for the complete amplitude

is transverse with regard to the externals photons lines, and as expected

5

4our denition of the integrals ist is similar to that of rosenbergs [8] if k1 is exchanged with k2.

7

now we will show that the expression of the amplitude (3.6) is quite general, in the sense
that its form is unchanged when the value of the factor c(a, b) is not constrained by the condi-
tion (2.18) and hence is dierent from (2.19). from the property g(p, k1, k2) = g(p, k2, k1),
it follows that the nite cuto dependent part of the integral  r dp g(p, k1, k2)p is pro-
portional to (k1 k2). then, if we compare the divergence of the axial current obtained
from (3.6) with the general expression (2.15), we conclude that the factor c(a, b) which enters
in a1 (3.8) and a2 (3.9) is just the factor c(a, b) entering in (2.15). finally the requirement
of gauge invariance implies that the factor c(a, b) which enters in a4 (3.11) and a5 (3.12),
is again the general factor c(a, b) of (2.15). we can notice that the factors a4 and a5, are
similar to the nite factors obtained by rosenberg [8] with dimensional arguments, if and
only if the value of the factor c(a, b) is one (2.20). in this case, the axial anomaly (2.15) has
the standard numerical value and the contribution (3.3) of i 
vanishes. since the integral
i 
vanishes formally as the cuto goes to innity and is thus due to the contribution of an
2
evanescent operator, the fact that the axial anomaly can be undetermined is directly related
to the non uniform convergence of the regularized integrals, as we will now see.

2

4 discussion

in perturbation theory the amplitudes are in general regularized through the regulariza-
tion of individual feynman diagrams. if we dene the standard non regularized amplitude

(p, k1, k2), we know from jackiws work [3] that the dierence of two
non regularized triangle graphs, which dier only from a shift of integration variable, is given
by

(k1, k2)  r dp a

5

5

z dp a

5

(p, k1, k2)  z dp a

5

(p + ak1 + bk2, k1, k2)  (b  a)(k1  k2).

(4.1)

the term of the right-hand side arises from a surface term when the remaining integral is
evaluated symmetrically. this term which induced the anomaly is undetermined because it
contains the arbitrary real constants a and b. thus if we regularize the amplitude 
by
subtracting the divergence [9] from its integrand, the undetermined contribution to the nite
part reected by (4.1), is suppressed if we impose a symmetry condition like for instance
gauge invariance. since due to dimensional arguments the ai, for i  3 are nite [8], this
method is equivalent to x uniquely, by the requirement of gauge invariance, the nite part
of a1 and a2 [8] without any kind of regularization. the net result is that one obtains the
standard numerical value for the axial anomaly. as we have seen the conclusion is dierent
when we start with regularized amplitudes by means of cuto functions.

5

the reason is the following. suppose that we regularize the standard triangle graph by
hand by substituting the free electron propagator s(p) by s(p)(p), where (p) is a cuto

8

2 and 1/k2

1 in (3.11) and (3.12).

5reg(k1, k2)  r dp a

function of the kind (2.17) 5. then the regularized amplitude 
is nite, non gauge invariant and given by (3.6) if we suppress respectively the term propor-
tional to 1/k2
it follows that the left-hand side of (4.1)
is zero because now the two integrals are invariant under a change of variable. since
lim a
(p, k1, k2), this discrepancy results from the non uniform
convergence of the regularized integrals. in this case the fact that the triangle graph is un-
determined is not due to the shift of integration variable, but to the arbitrary choice which
we can make for the cuto functions. the conditions which are necessary for the gauge
invariance of the regularized amplitude (3.6) are [8]

a2(k1, k2) = k1k2a6(k1, k2) + k2

2a4(k1, k2)
2a5(k1, k2).

(4.2)

since all the ais are nite we are not allowed to subtract anything from the regularized
amplitude (3.6). then the conditions (4.2) impose that, 1) the cuto functions must verify
the relation (2.20) 6, or 2) that the factors a3, a4, or the factors a6, a5 must be also cuto
dependent. the two possibilities imply that the strength of the axial anomaly depends of
the form of the cuto functions.
it is just the second possibility which is realized in the
regularized amplitude (2.8). can we understand the result (2.15,3.6) by comparison with
other gauge invariant regularization scheme?

if we exclude dimensional regularization which is in some sense too formal and not
adapted to feynman diagrams containing the 5 matrix, we rst study the connection with
pauli-villars regularization. in this scheme the regularized fermions loops are obtained by
integration over massive regulators elds of negative norm. then, as we know, the axial
anomaly is given by

(4.3)

we obtain the same result in replacing the non-regularized amplitudes (k1 + k2)
of the
right-hand side of (4.3) by their regularized form (2.15).
in this case the standard value
of the axial anomaly is just given by the dierence between the amplitudes (2.15) of the
triangle graph relative to a massless electron and that of an electron of innite mass.

5

in lattice regularization the known result for the axial anomaly of qed is recovered if the
regularized gauge invariant action converges formally to the standard one when the lattice
spacing tends to zero and locality is assumed [10]. in fact, under these general conditions

5such a method was used in order to regularize the divergence of the axial current in [11] in a non gauge

invariant manner.

6in this case we recover the standard numerical value for the axial anomaly,

9

the lattice chiral ward-takahashi identity can be taylor subtracted at zero momentum,
and then in the continuous limit the taylor subtracted lattice feynman integrals which
enter this identity are nite. this implies that the continuous limit of the taylor subtracted
lattice chiral ward-takahashi identity converges uniformly to the standard anomalous ward-
takahashi identity. notice that like in the scheme of pauli-villars, the regularization of the
continuous limit of the lattice regularization of the chiral ward-takahashi identity is done by
subtracting the potentially divergent terms in the integrand of the lattice feynman integrals.

5 conclusion and summary

we have shown that in a non perturbative gauge invariant regularization scheme of qed,
where the divergences are regularized through the smearing of the point like interactions, the
divergence of the axial current can be deduced from the regularized equations of motions.
it follows that at the one loop level, the anomalous ward-takahashi identity thus obtained
is nite but depends on the shape of the cuto functions. since the latter relation is nite
we are not free to make any subtraction, if one assumes that the relevant coupling constants
which describe qed are only the charge and electron mass. this in turn implies that the
axial anomaly is in general sensitive to the form of the cuto functions. in order to recover
the standard result, the only possibility which is left, is to constrain the cuto functions
to verify the strong relation (2.20). in this case the contribution (3.3) to the regularized
triangle amplitude of the evanescent operator which is imposed by the necessity of gauge
invariance vanishes. this feature is not seen in physical perturbative regularization schemes,
even in the continuous limit of lattice regularization, which is also perturbative, because in
all these methods the uv divergences are subtracted o. in conclusion the axial anomaly
is really undetermined in the framework of qed, because in all cases its strength is nite
and does not depend of the rescaling of the cuto, but depends of the shape of the cuto
functions.
