we consider null bosonic p-branes moving in curved space-times. some exact solu-
tions of the classical equations of motion and of the constraints for the null string and
the null membrane in demianski-newman background are found.

1 introduction

the null p-branes are the zero tension limit of the usual p-branes, the 1-brane
being a string. this relationship between them may be regarded as a generalization of
the correspondence between massless and massive particles. on the other hand, the
characteristic scale of string theory is given by the string tension t = (2)1. then
one may view the high energy limit of string theory as a zero tension limit, since only
the energy measured in string units, e/t 1/2, is relevant.

the investigations in the domain of classical and quantum string propagation in
curved space-times are relevant for the quantum gravity as well as for the understanding
of the cosmic string models in cosmology. as we have already mentioned, strings are
characterized by an energy scale t 1/2 and the length of the string scales like 1/t 1/2.
the gravitational eld provides another length scale, the curvature radius of the space-
time rc. for a string moving in a gravitational eld an appropriate parameter is the
dimensionless constant c = rct 1/2. large values of c imply weak gravitational eld.
one may reach large values of c by letting t  . in this limit the string shrinks to
a point. in the opposite limit, small values of c, one encounters strong gravitational
elds and it is appropriate to consider t  0, i.e. null or tensionless strings.
the motion of classical null bosonic strings in curved backgrounds have been consid-
ered recently in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. the dynamics of null p-branes living in friedmann-
robertson-walker space-time with at space-like section (k = 0) have been investigated
in [8].

in this letter we describe the classical evolution of the null strings and membranes
in demianski-newman background [9]. in sec. 2 we begin with the general case of
tensionless p-branes moving in d-dimensional curved space-times. in sec. 3 we obtain
some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints for the null
string (p = 1) and the null membrane (p = 2) in the above mentioned background.
sec. 4 is devoted to our concluding remarks.

2 null p-branes in curved background

to begin with, let us write down one of the possible actions for the null bosonic

p-brane living in a d-dimensional curved space-time with metric tensor g(x):

s = z dp+1l

j = /j

,

l = v j v kj xkxg(x),
j = ( 0, j) = (, j),

,

(1)

j, k = 0, 1, ..., p

,

j, k = 1, ..., p

,

,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1.

it is an obvious generalization of the at space-time action given in [10]. one easily
veries that if x(), g() are world-volume scalars and v j () is a world-volume
contravariant vector density of weight q = 1/2, then l() is a scalar density of weight
q = 1. as a consequence, the variation of the action (1) is

s = z dp+1j (jl)

and thus this action is invariant under world-volume reparametrizations if suitable
boundary conditions are assumed.

varying (1) with respect to x and v j , one obtains the following equations of

motion :

j(cid:16)v j v kkx(cid:17) + 

v j v kj xkx = 0,
v j j xkxg(x) = 0,

where 

 is the connection compatible with the metric g(x):



 =

2

g(g + g  g).

let us rewrite for further convenience the lagrangian density (1) in the form ( =

/, j = /j):

l =

1
40 g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x,

where the connection between v j and (0, j) is given by

v j = (v 0, v j) =  

1

20 ,

j

20!.

now the euler-lagrange equation for x takes the form:

" 1

20 (  kk)x#  j" j

20 (  kk)x#
(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.

+

1
20

(2)

(3)

the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers 0 and j which follow from (2)
give the constraints :

g(x)(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0,
g(x)(  kk)xjx = 0.

(4)
(5)

we note (and it is easy to check) that in the gauge j = const,

x(, k) = x(k + k)

is a nontrivial solution of the equations of motion (3) and of the constraints (4), (5), de-
pending on d arbitrary functions of p variables for the null p-brane moving in arbitrary
d-dimensional gravity background.

in terms of x and the conjugated momentum p the constraints (4) can be written

as:

t0 = g(x)pp = 0

,

tj = pjx = 0.

then one can show that the hamiltonian which corresponds to the lagrangian density
(2) is a linear combination of t0 and tj

h = z dp(0t0 + jtj).

computation of the poisson brackets between t0 and tj results in the following con-
straint algebra

{t0(1), t0(2)} = 0,
{t0(1), tj(2)} = [t0(1) + t0(2)]jp(1  2),
{tj(1), tk(2)} = [l
 = (1, ..., p).

ktj(2)]lp(1  2),

jtk(1) + l

(6)

comparing the equalities (6) with the zero tension limit of the bosonic p-brane at
space-time constraint algebra [11] we see that they coincide. however this is not the
case with the hamiltonian equations of motion of course. these are:

(  kk)x = 20g(x)p,
 p  k(kp) + 0g(x)pp = 0.

(7)

general solutions of the equations (7) can be easily found only in at space-times.
for example, the general solution for the null string case in an arbitrary gauge is [12]:

x(, 1) = g(v)  2
p(, 1) = f(v)/1(1),

z 0(s)
[1(s)]2 dsf (v),

where g(v), f(v) are arbitrary functions of the variable

v =  +

.

in curved space-times one can try to nd backgrounds in which the system of partial
dierential equations (7) essentially simplies. an example of this type are the confor-
mally at spaces, in which the equation of motion for p (in the gauge j = constants)
reduces to (  jj)p = 0 if we take into account the constraint t0 = 0, and has as
a general solution p(, k) = p(k + k).

3 null strings and membranes

in demianski-newman space-time

in this section we will work in the gauge 0, j = constants, in which the euler-

lagrange equations (3) have the form :

(  jj)(  kk)x + 

(  jj)x(  kk)x = 0.

(8)

we are going to look for solutions of the equations of motion (8) and constraints (4),
(5), for the null string (p = 1) and the null membrane (p = 2) moving in demianski-
newman background [9]. the metric for this space-time is of the following type:

ds2 = g00(dx0)2 + 2g01dx0dx1 + 2g03dx0dx3 + 2g13dx1dx3 + g22(dx2)2 + g33(dx3)2.

it can be put in a form in which the manifest expressions for g are given by the
equalities (all other components are zero) [13]:

,

g11 =  1 

g00 =  exp(+2u)
g22 = (cid:16)r2  a2 sin2 (cid:17) exp(2u),
g33 = r2 sin2  exp(2u) "2(mr + l)a sin2  + 2r2l cos 
g03 = 

2(mr + l)a sin2  + 2r2l cos 

r2  a2 sin2 
exp(+2u),

a2 sin2 

r2 ! exp(2u),
#2

(9)

exp(+2u),

r2  a2 sin2 

where

exp(2u) = "1  2

mr + l (a cos  + l)

r2 + (a cos  + l)2 #1

,

r2 = r2  2mr + a2  l2,

m is a mass parameter, a is an angular momentum per unit mass and l is the nut
parameter. the metric (9) is a stationary axisymmetric metric.
it belongs to the
vacuum solutions of the einstein eld equations, which are of type d under petrovs
classication. the kerr and nut space-times are particular cases of the considered

4

metric and can be obtained by putting l = 0 or a = 0 in (9). the case l = 0, a = 0
obviously corresponds to the schwarzschild solution.

starting with the string case, we introduce the ansatz

x0(, 1) = c 0f (z1) + t( ),
x1(, 1) = r( )
x3(, 1) = c 3f (z1) + ( ),

,

z1 = 1 + 1,

x2(, 1) = ( ),

(10)

where f (z1) is an arbitrary function of z1 and c 0, c 3 are constants. the substitution
of (10) in (4), (5) and (8), for the given metric, allows us to obtain a solution of the
equations for t  t/ ,

  / and constraints (5) in the form (c1 = const):

t( ) = c1(cid:16)c 0g03 + c 3g33(cid:17) exp(h),
( ) = +c1(cid:16)c 0g00 + c 3g03(cid:17) exp(h),
h = z (cid:16)g00dg00 + 2g03dg03 + g33dg33(cid:17).

(11)

the condition for compatibility of this solution with the other equations and constraints
(4) reads:

exp(h)  h = g00g33  g2
03.

then one can show that the solutions for r = r/ and  = / are expressed by
the equalities:

g

r2 = g11"c 2
2 = c2(r) + c 2

h

 #.

(12)

in obtaining (12), we have used that for the metric (9) the following condition is

fullled: 2(g22/g11) = 0.

in the particular case when x2 =  = 0 = const, one can integrate the equations
of motion and constraints completely to obtain an exact solution for the null string in
the gravity background (9). this solution is given by (10), where

exp(+2u0)  c 3 exp(2u0)#w 1/2,

exp(+2u0)w 1/2,

for the null membrane, we use the ansatz

(c 0 + c 3a0)2

exp(+4u0)#,

u0 = u|=0,

x0(, ) = c 0f [w(z1, z2)] + t( ),
x1(, ) = r( )
x3(, ) = c 3f [w(z1, z2)] + ( ),
j = 1, 2,

zj = j + j,

,

x2(, ) = ( ),

(14)

where the arbitrary function f depends on zj only by the one variable w. then one
proceeds as in the null string case to obtain an exact solution for the null membrane
in the demianski-newman background. it is given by (14) with  = 0 = const and
t,  and  taken from (13).

4 conclusions

in this letter we perform some investigations on the classical dynamics of the
null bosonic branes in curved space-times. in the second section we give the action,
show that it is reparametrization invariant and write down the equations of motion and
constraints in an arbitrary gauge. then we construct the corresponding hamiltonian
and compute the constraint algebra. it coincides with the at space-time algebra. the
hamiltonian equations of motion are also given. in the third section we consider the
dynamics of the null strings and membranes in the demianski-newman background.
some exact solutions of the equations of motion and of the constraints are found. in
particular, our null string solution (10), (13) generalizes the one obtained in [5] for the
kerr space-time.
