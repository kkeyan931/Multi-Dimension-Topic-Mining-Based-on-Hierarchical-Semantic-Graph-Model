abstract: the zeta and etafunctions associated with massless and massive dirac operators, in
a d-dimensional (d odd or even) manifold without boundary, are rigorously constructed.
several mathematical subtleties involved in this process are stressed, as the intrisic am-
biguity present in the denition of the associated fermion functional determinant in the
massless case and, also, the unavoidable presence (in some situations) of a multiplica-
tive anomaly, that can be conveniently expressed in terms of the noncommutative residue.
the ambiguity is here seen to disappear in the massive case, giving rise to a phase of the
dirac determinant that agrees with very recent calculations appeared in the mathematical
literature and to a multiplicative anomaly also in agreement with other calculations,
in the coinciding situations. after explicit, nontrivial resummation of the mass series ex-
pansions involving zeta and eta functions, the results are expressed in terms of quite simple
formulas.

introduction

it is well known that, within the so-called one-loop approximation in quantum field theory, the
euclidean one-loop eective action  may be expressed in terms of the functional determinant
of an elliptic dierential operator o, dened on a d-dimensional manifold, namely

  ln det o .

(1.1)

the ultraviolet one-loop divergences, which are present, may be regularized by means of the
zeta-function regularization (for recent reviews, see [1, 2, 3]).
in the bosonic sector, one is
dealing, typically, with a second order self-adjoint non-negative operator l, whose spectrum is
bounded from below (e.g., it is real and non-negative). in this case, a quite elementary approach
is at our disposal, namely the heat-kernel technique, which allows to dene the zeta-function in
an elementary and direct way by means of the related mellin transform, i.e.

(s|l) =

1

(s) z 

0

dt ts1 tr etl ,

(1.2)

valid for re s > d/2. here tr etl = pi eti, i being the eigenvalues of l. as a consequence,
(s|l) = pi s
if zero modes are present, one has to subtract them, replacing tr etl 
tr etl  p0, p0 being the projector onto the zero modes. the short-t asymptotics of tr etl
have been well studied both in the physical and in the mathematical literature [4, 5]. for a
second-order operator on a boundaryless d-dimensional (smooth) manifold, it reads

.

i

tr etl 



xj=0

aj(l) tjd/2 ,

(1.3)

in which aj(l) are the seeley-dewitt coecients, that can be computed with dierent tech-
niques. making use of the mellin transform denition, a standard argument leads directly to a
particular case of seeleys meromorphic extension theorem, namely

(s|l) =

(1.4)

1



(s) 
xj=0


aj(l)
s + j  d

2

+ j(s, u)
 ,

where j(s, u) is the analytic part of the zeta-function. it turns out that this analytic extension
is regular at s = 0 and thus, the regularized functional determinant of l can be dened by
[6, 7, 8]

log det l = (0|l) .

(1.5)

in the fermionic sector, the situation is quite dierent. usually, one deals with a rst order
dierential operator a (the dirac operator, the rarita-schwinger operator). to begin with, let
us consider the self-adjoint case. here the spectrum is unbounded over the whole real axis.
it is obvious that heat-kernel techniques are no longer useful and one has to make use of the
general theory of complex powers of a pseudo-dierential operator (do) [9]. in the following,
we present some known facts about the complex powers of dos which we will often use.

let us consider a d-dimensional, smooth (compact) manifold without boundary, md, and
a (classical) do, q, acting on sections of vector bundles on md. to any classical do,

2

it corresponds a complete symbol (q) = q(x, k) = eikxqeikx, such that, modulo innitely
smoothing operators, one has

(qf )(x)  zrd

dk

(2)d zrd

dy ei(xy)kq(x, k)f (y) .

the complete symbol of q admits an asymptotic expansion for |k|  , given by

q(x, k) 



xj=0

qqj(x, k) ,

(1.6)

(1.7)

where the coecients fulll the homogeneity property qqj(x, tk) = tqjqqj(x, k), for t > 0,
being qq(x, k) 6= 0. the number q is called the order of q and qq(x, k) its principal symbol.
recall that q is elliptic when qq(x, k) is invertible.
can be dened as soon as there exists a conical neighborough c of
a ray l = {  c, arg = } such that it contains, at most, only a nite number of eigenvalues
of q. under this condition, the zeta function can be dened, for re s larger than an abscissa of
convergence, given by d/q, as

the complex powers qs


(s|q) = tr qs

 = xi

s
i

,

(1.8)

where the sum is over the whole spectrum of q and s is dened with respect to the admissible
cut l, namely

s = exp (s ln ) ,

  2  im ln  <  .

(1.9)

it is possible to show again that (s|q) possesses a meromorphic continuation to the whole
complex plane and that it is regular at the origin [9]. thus, one can dene

ln det q = (0|q) .

(1.10)

as a result, in general, both the zeta function as well as its derivative may depend on the spectral
cut l. following wodzicki, one is led to study the function

(s|q) = (s|q)  1(s|q) ,

(1.11)

where l1 is another admissible cut. the general properties of (s|q) have been investigated in
[10, 11] and they can expressed by means of the noncommutative residue, that will be introduced
in the next section. we shall mainly be interested in (0|q), since it is related to the ambiguity
in the denition of the functional determinant of q, and we will discuss it, in an elementary
way. here we only recall the case when the ambiguity may be present.

let us introduce the two sectors of the complex plane associated with the two admissible

cuts, namely

s = {,  < arg  < 1} ,

s1 = {, 1  2 < arg  < } .

(1.12)

now, it is possible to show that if there is an innite number of eingenvalues of q in both sectors
s and s1, then (0|q) is non-vanishing and there exists an ambiguity in the denition of the
functional determinant of q [10, 11] .

3

as shown by wodzicki, a new spectral function plays a role in relation to this ambiguity. it

is the eta-function of q, introduced in ref. [13], which, for large re s, is dened by

(s|q) = xi

signi|i|s .

(1.13)

it can be proven that the eta-function has a meromorphic extension, which is regular at the
origin [10, 11] .

if we apply these general results to the dirac operator, it follows that, in general, there
is an ambiguity in the denition of the eective action, already noticed in [14, 15], and the
eta-invariant, i.e. (0|q), will enter the game. this happens only in odd dimension and it is
known as the appearance of an intrisic parity anomaly term, the so called induced chern-simons
term [16, 17]. in even dimension the ambiguity is still present, but depends on a seeley-dewitt
coecient and may be absorbed by a redenition of the scale renormalization (see, for example
[15]).

the contents of the paper are the following. in sec. 2, some elements of wodzickis theory
and the multiplicative anomaly are presented, for the sake of completeness.
in sec. 3, the
zeta-function and the eta-function associated with the massless dirac operator are revisited. an
example is considered in detail and a brief study of the relevant wodzicki function  is presented.
in sec. 4 the massive case is considered and, specically, the one-loop eective action in sec.
5. the multiplicative anomaly corresponding to the very common case of the massive dirac
operator multiplied by its adjoint is obtained in sec. 6. we also give here explicit formulas for
the phase of the massive dirac determinant and for its relation with that of the square root of
the massive laplacian. they constitute the main results of the paper. some explicit examples
are discussed in sec. 7 in detail. sec. 8 is devoted to conclusions. finally, in an appendix we
analyze the disappearance of the ambiguity in the denition of the zeta function for the massive
dirac operator, determined by the sign of the mass term. this is also, in itself, a remarkable
result.

2 the noncommutative (or wodzicki) residue

for the readers convenience, we will review in this section some information concerning the
wodzicki theory on the noncommutative residue [18] (see also [19, 10, 12, 11]) that will be used
in the rest of the paper.

in order to introduce the denition of the noncommutative residue of a do, q, let us
consider an elliptic positive (dierential) operator a, with a = 2p > q, p integer, and form the
family of dos aq(u) = a + uq, u being a real parameter. the associated zeta-function reads

(s|aq(u)) = tr(a + uq)s .

(2.1)

the meromorphic structure of the above zeta-function can be obtained from the short-t asymp-
totics of tr eaq(u) [20], namely

tr etaq(u) 



xj=1

j(u)t(jd)/2p +



xk=1

k(u)tk ln t .

(2.2)

4

note the presence of logarithmic terms that lead, using the mellin transform, to double poles in
the meromorphic expansion of (s|aq(u)), i.e.
+z 
1 (cid:19) dt ts1 tr eaq(u)

(s|aq(u)) =

1

0


(s) (cid:18)z 1
(s) 
xj=1


1

=

(u)j
s + jd
2p





xk=1

k(u)

(s + k)2 + j(s, u)
 ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

where j(s, u) is the analytic part. taking the derivative with respect to u and then the limit
u  0, one gets

d
du

lim
u0

tr(a + uq)s = s tr(qas1)
j(0)
s + jd
2p



=

1

(s)


xj=1





xk=1

k(0)

(s + k)2 + j(s, 0)
 .

by denition, the noncommutative residue of q is given by

res(q) = res(cid:20)2p lim

u0

d
du

tr(a + uq)s(cid:21)s=1

= 2p1(0) ,

where res is the usual cauchy residue. it is possible to show that res(q) is independent on the
elliptic operator a and that it is a trace in the algebra of classical dos (actually, the only
trace up to multiplicative constants). from the above denition and taking the derivative with
respect to u at u = 0 of eq. (2.2), one obtains a possible way to compute the noncommutative
residue. in fact

tr(cid:16)qeta(cid:17)  



xj6=d+2p

j(0)t(jd)/2p1  d+2p 

res(q)

2m

ln t + o(t ln t).

(2.6)

thus, the noncommutative residue of q can be read o from the short t asymptotics of the

quantity tr(cid:16)qeta(cid:17), just picking up the coecient associated with ln t.

when the manifold is non-compact, this is one of the methods that we have at hand for
evaluating the wodzicki residue, as long as all the traces involved exist. for the case of a
compact manifold, wodzicki has obtained a useful local form of the noncommutative residue,
that is, a density which can be integrated to yield the noncommutative residue, namely

res(q) = zmd

dx

(2)d z|k|=1

tr qd(x, k)dk .

(2.7)

here the component of order d (remember that d is the dimension of the manifold) of the
complete symbol appears as well as the internal trace tr. eqs. (2.4) or (2.6) give

lemma 1. in a neighborhood of z = 0,

tr(qaz) =

res(q)

2pz

+

 res(q)

2p

5

 d+2p(0) + o(z) ,

(2.8)

where  is the euler-mascheroni constant. the latter equation gives another way to compute
the noncommutative residue, namely (this expression was also found by guillemin [12])

if a is a positive elliptic (dierential) operator of positive order a, then we can write

res(q) = 2p(cid:2)res tr(qaz)(cid:3)z=0 .

(2.9)

(a|s + ) = tr[aas] =

res(a)

as

+ nite terms ,

 > 0 .

(2.10)

thus, we see that the residues of the poles of the zeta function on the positive real axis are
proportional to the noncommutative residues of some negative power of a. more precisely we
obtain

res (a|s)|s= =

res(a)

a

,

 > 0 .

(2.11)

with the latter formula we can compute the residues of all the poles situated on the positive real
axis for the zeta function of any elliptic operator of positive order. eq. (2.11) is more general
than the well known and well used heat-kernel counterpart, since it works for operators of even
order, as well as for operators of odd order (for examples and some applications see [22]).

we conclude this section recalling the multiplicative anomaly formula (see, for instance,
[21, 23, 24, 25]). we consider two invertible, elliptic, positive (self-adjoint) operators, a and b,
on md of positive orders, a and b, respectively, and the quantity

f (a, b) =

det(ab)

(det a)(det b)

= ea(a,b) .

(2.12)

it is understood that the functional determinants are here dened by means of zeta-function
regularization. by construction, a(a, b) is called the multiplicative anomaly. we start from its
expression in terms of the kontsevich-vishik multiplicative anomaly formula [21], namely

a(a, b) = z 1

0

dt res(cid:20)ln(cid:16)ab

a

b(cid:17)(cid:18) ln a(t)
a 

ln[a(t)b]

a + b (cid:19)(cid:21) .

(2.13)

this formula, eq. (2.13), notably simplies in the special case of commuting operators. in fact
one then has

a(a, b) =

b

2a(a + b)

resh(ln(ab

a

b ))2i ,

(2.14)

which can be rewritten as the wodzicki multiplicative formula [19]

a(a, b) =

resh(ln(abba))2i

2ab(a + b)

= a(b, a) ,

(2.15)

where the symmetry property in a and b is manifest. physical applications of this formula
have been given in [23, 24, 25]. a direct computation of the multiplicative anomaly in higher
dimensional manifolds can be found in [26] and an application to chiral anomaly has been given
in [27]. very recently, it has been shown that the multiplicative anomaly gives contributions to
the one-loop eective action obtained by dimensional reduction [28].

3 the zeta function of the dirac operator and its  invariant

as mentioned in the introduction, if the elliptic operator a is not positive denite, the general
theory of complex powers of elliptic operators may still be used, but then another spectral
function, namely the eta-function plays (besides the zeta function) a very important role. it is
convenient to start with the assumption of dealing with a self-adjoint operator, which we will
consider for the moment to be the massless euclidean dirac operator on a compact (curved)
manifold m of dimension d. it has the form
a = i/d = i ,

(3.1)
where e
k are viel-bein elds, k the dirac matrices in d dimensions and  the covariant
derivative in the spin connection. since a+ = a, the corresponding eigenvalues are real. let
us denote by i the positive eigenvalues and by i the negative ones. since the spectrum is
contained in the whole real axis, we have essentially two possible denitions of zeta function,
because there exist two essentially dierent cuts, one in the lower and the other in the upper
half-planes respectively.
in both cases, the associated sectors contain an innite number of
eigenvalues and the related zeta functions read (for re s suciently large)

 = e

k k ,

and

+(s|a) = xi

s

i + eisxi

(i)s

(s|a) = xi

s

i + eisxi

(i)s .

on the other hand, the eta-function may be also dened as

(s|a) = xi

s

i xi

(i)s = tr(cid:18) a
|a|

(a2)

s

2(cid:19) .

making use of the above denitions, a direct computation gives [10]

and

(s|a) =

1 + eis
2i sin s

+(s|a) 

1 + eis
2i sin s

(s|a)

( s

2|a2) =

1  eis
2i sin s

(s|a) 

1  eis
2i sin s

+(s|a) ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

where (z|a2) is the zeta function associated with the spinor laplacian l = a2, a second order
non negative self-adjoint elliptic operator, whose zeta function can be unambiguosly dened.

in order to study the wodzicki function, namely

(s|a) = +(s|a)  (s|a),

(3.7)

we may express the two zeta functions in terms of the eta-function and (z|a2). from eqs. (3.5)
and (3.6), one gets

(s|a) =

1

2h1 + eisi ( s

2|l) +

1

2 h1  eisi (s|a) .

(3.8)

7

as a consequence, we obtain the result

for physical applications, it is also useful to give the rst derivative with respect to s, i.e.

(s|a) = i sin s(cid:2)(s|a)  ( s

2|l)(cid:3) .

(3.9)

(3.10)

(s|a) = i sin s(cid:20)(s|a) 

1
2

( s

2|l)(cid:21) + i cos s(cid:2)(s|a)  ( s

2|l)(cid:3) .

then, the ambiguity is described by the value at s = 0 of the wodzicki function and its derivative.
these values depend on the regularity at s = 0 of (s|a) and ( s
2|l). the latter is known to
be regular (the seeley theorem). with regard to the eta-function, wodzicki has proven its
analyticity at the origin. however, in the particular but important case of the dirac operator,
a direct approach is known and we will use it.

first, let us consider the even dimensional case d = 2p. here, the 5 matrix exists, namely:
d+1 = 1  d, and, as is well known, since d+1 anticommutes with /d , both i and i are
eigenvalues for /d with eigenfunctions +
i and i = d+1+
i respectively. in these conditions,
the eta-function identically vanishes. we have (0|a) = 0, and

1

(s|a) =

2h1 + eisi ( s
+(0|a) = (0|a) = ap(l) ,

2|l) ,

and


(0|a) =

1
2

(0|l) 

i
2

ap(l) ,

+(0|a)  

(0|a) = iap(l) .

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

(3.14)

here the ambiguity depends on the local functional of the external gauge eld, the seeley-dewitt
coecient ap(l), and since the one-loop eective action is dened modulo counterterms of the
same nature, it can be reabsorbed by the renormalization procedure.

in the odd dimensional case d = 2p + 1 however, there is no symmetry in the spectrum and
one has the possibility of a non trivial eta-function. furthermore, starting from (3.4), one also
may use the mellin representation of the eta-function, namely for re s suciently large

(s|a) =

1

(s) z 

0

dt ts1 tr(cid:18) a
|a|

et|a|(cid:19) ,

which can be conveniently rewritten as

(s|a) =

1

2 )z 

0

( s+1

dt t

s+1

2 1 tr(cid:16)aeta2(cid:17) .

(3.15)

(3.16)

by the standard heat kernel techniques, we can try to nd the analytic continuation of the
eta-invariant. to this aim, one needs the short t asymptotics of the integrand. this involves a

8

highly non trivial calculation and the answer is provided by a theorem due to bismut and freed

[29], which states that tr(cid:16)aeta2(cid:17) = o(t1/2). more precisely

tr(cid:16)aeta2(cid:17) 



xl=0

cl+p+2tl+

1
2 ,

where the cr are suitable coecients. thus, the merophormic extension reads

(s|a) =

1
( s+1
2 )



xr=0

cl+p+2

s/2 + l + 1

+ 0(s|a) ,

(3.17)

(3.18)

from which the regularity at s = 0 of (s|a) directly follows. in the latter equation, 0(s|a) is
an analytic function of s. as a result,

and

+(0|a) = (0|a) = 0 ,


(0|a) =

1
2

(0|l) 

i
2

(0|a) ,

+(0|a)  

(0|a) = i(0|a) .

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

here, the ambiguity is non-trivial, since, as it is clear from (3.18), (0|a) is a non local functional
of the external gauge eld and it cannot be removed by addition of counterterms. note that, in
fact, all our results are particular cases of wodzickis main theorem and its corollaries and we
need no new proofs. the originality resides in that we have made them absolutely explicit and
applicable to the very important case of the physics of the dirac operator.

futhermore, from the bismut and freed theorem, and making a mellin transform inversion,

we also get

tr(cid:18) a
|a|

et|a|(cid:19) =

1

2izre z>0

dztz(z)(z|a) .

(3.22)

for z = 0, one has a simple pole, while for z = 2,4, .., one has double poles. shifting the
vertical line to the left, one obtains the short t asymptotics

tr(cid:18) a
|a|

et|a|(cid:19)  (0|a)
xl=0



+

2cl+2+p

(2l + 2)!(l  1

2 ) h  (l  1

2 )  ln ti t2l+2 ,

(3.23)

where (z) is the di-gamma function. it should be noted the presence of logarithmic terms in
this short-t expansion, due to the fact that one is dealing with a do. from eq. (3.23) we have

lim
t0

tr(cid:18) a
|a|

et|a|(cid:19) = (0|a) ,

9

(3.24)

which may be useful in the evaluation of the eta invariant. another representation of the eta
invariant, which easily follows, is

(0|a) = z 

0

dt tr(cid:16)aet|a|(cid:17) .

(3.25)

as an application of eq. (3.24), we present a simple proof of the classical result obtained in
[17], where quantum massless fermions coupled to a classical gauge eld in 2 + 1 dimensions
were shown to generate a chern-simons term, conrming the result got in [30] within a local
zeta-function approach. the idea is to compute the rst variation of the eta-invariant. starting
from eq. (3.24), one gets

(0|a) =  lim

t0ht tr(cid:16)aet|a|(cid:17)i .

here a = (i  ea) = ea, a being the electromagnetic potential. thus,

tr(cid:16)aet|a|(cid:17) = ez dxa tr(cid:16)et|a|(x, x)(cid:17) .

the spectral theorem gives

et|a|(x, x) = z 

0

det(a2)(x, x) .

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

since one is interested in the t  0 limit, only the asymptotics for    of the local spectral
density is relevant. in d = 3, one has (see, for example, [31]) when   

(a2)(x, x)

(3.29)

where a1(x) =  f 
(4)3/2 , with f = f , is the rst non-trivial seeley-dewitt coecient
releted to the spinor laplacian. the leading term gives no contribution and taking the internal
traces, one has for the non trivial ground state fermion current contribution



(0|a)
a

e
22 f  ,

= 

(3.30)

which is the redlich result. we note that the sign ambiguity is always present in the massless
case, because the total eective action is given by (3.20) and has nothing to do with the pauli-
villars regularization, as often claimed in the literature.

we close this section by presenting a heuristic argument for the regularity of the eta-function

at the origin. let us start from (3.4), namely

with q = a
|a|
origin we have

, |a| = a2. q is a do of zero order. by making use of lemma 1, near the

(s|a) = tr(cid:16)q(a2)

s

2(cid:17) ,

(3.31)

(s|a) =

res(q)

s

+


2

res(q)  d+2(0) + o(s) .

(3.32)

thus, we have arrived at the following statement:

10

proposition 1. the eta-function related to a non positive elliptic operator a is regular at

s = 0 if and only if res( a
|a|

) = 0, where |a| = a2.

example 1. on a compact at manifold m with odd dimension d, the massless dirac

operator has the form

 being the dirac matrices in d 1 dimensions. for the sake of simplicity, let us work in d = 3
and assume a constant gauge potential v, namely a vanishing eld strenght f . thus

a = i/d = i ,

(3.33)

a2 = /d 2 = 2 ,

|a| = 2 .

the local symbol reads

(3.34)

(3.35)

(cid:18) a

|a|(cid:19) (x, k) =

k/ + v/

,

pk2 + v 2 + 2k/v/

in order to select the homogeneous component of degree 3, we may consider k  k, with 
very large, and pick up the term proportional to 1/3. one gets, with |k| = 1,

(cid:18) a

|a|(cid:19) (x, k) = ... +(cid:16)c1v/ + c2(v/)3(cid:17) 3 + ...

(3.36)

where the c1 and c2 are simple functions of v . in the evaluation of the wodzicki residue one
has to take the internal trace tr and this gives a vanishing contribution because, in d = 3, not
only tr v/ = 0, but also tr(v/ 3) = 0, since tr  = 2 .

4 the massive dirac operator

let us consider now the case of massive spinors. denoting the massive operator by k = a + im,
we have

ki = (a + im)i = (i + im)i ,

(4.1)

where, as above, i and i are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a. k is non-hermitian
and its eigenvalues are now complex numbers. as in the massless case, we also have here two
possible spectral cuts, and the two zeta functions may in principle be dened as

(s|k) = xi>0

(i + im)s + xi<0hei(i) + imis(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=

.

(4.2)

however, due to the presence here of the mass term +im (and being the mass m positive),
in order to avoid a singularity in the complex powers of the spectrum of k = a + im when we
perform the analytical continuation of the spectral values (from positive i to negative i, along
a path : iei, 0    ), it is compulsory to take +(s|k) e.g., to perform the analytic
continuation in the upper half plane. in fact, a singular point is lying in the lower half complex
-plane, namely at im, that gives rise to a cut in the complex s-plane when performing then the
analytic continuation in s. note that we have to perform two dierent analytical continuations

11

here, in a compatible way, and this is actually guaranteed in our method (see a more detailed
discussion of this issue in the appendix). quite on the contrary, when we will consider, below,
the adjoint operator k + = a  im, the analytical continuation must be performed on the lower
half-plane, namely the relevant zeta function will be (s|k +), in order to avoid the singularity
(see also the appendix). as we shall prove in a subsequent section, this argument turns out
to be very important for the obtaintion of the correct value for the multiplicative anomaly
corresponding to the product of the two operators, k and k +. notice also that our denition
of the zeta function for the operators k and k + slightly diers from the one adopted in [15],
where the imaginary part of the eigenvalues was also rotated.4 we believe that our denition
is the most natural one in the massive case, being the minimal extension of the corresponding
denition for selfadjoint operators with (in general) positive and negative spectrum that was
on its turn obtained from the rigorous mathematical theory for elliptic selfadjoint operators,
with no negative eigenvalues.

if the mass is suciently small, binomial expansion gives

+(s|k) =



xk=0

(1)k(s + k) (im)k

(s)k!

+(s + k|a) ,

and analogously for (s|k +). making use of eqs. (3.8), one arrives at

+(s|k) =

1
2

[1 + eis] ( s

2|l) +

(1)k(s + k) (im)k
xk=1
+ [1  ei(s+k)] (s + k|a)o .

n[1 + ei(s+k)] ( s+k

2 |l)

we have thus obtained, in a direct way, the meromorphic extension of the zeta function associ-
ated with the massive dirac operator, starting from the knowledge of the massless one.

as an example, if m is a at even-dimensional manifold, then (s|l) has only a simple pole
at s = d/2 with residue equal to (4)d/2dv, v being the volume of m . this means that
(s|k) has a nite number of simple poles at the points s = d  k > 0 (k = 0, 1, ..., d  1),
whose residues read

res +(s|k)|s=dk>0 =

2v(d + 1) (im)k

(4)d/2(d/2)(d  k)k!

.

(4.5)

observe that this result is independent of the choice of denition for the zeta function ().

furthermore, consider the free massive dirac operator in a at manifold. for the symbol,

we have

(i/d + im) = p/ + im ,

(i/d + im) =

1

p/ " 

xk=0 (cid:18)im

p/ (cid:19)k#

(4.6)

and, in order to compute the non-commutative residue, we must pick up the coecient of p/d
in the previous expansion. we see that such a coecient is non-vanishing only when  = n is

4to compare, the denition in [15] corresponds to rotating (i  im)ei, 0    , from  = 0 to  = .

12

an integer number smaller than or equal to d. under such condition, we get

res([a + im]n) =

(d + 1) (im)dn

(4)d/2(d/2)(n)(d  n)!

.

(4.7)

using this result in eq. (2.7) we obtain eq. (4.5) again.

5 the one-loop eective action

in this section we will compute the eective action for a massive spinor eld on a d-dimensional
manifold in terms of the zeta-function and the eta-function of the related massless operator. the
eective action turns out to be proportional to the logarithm of the functional determinant of the
dirac operator, which may be expressed as minus the rst derivative of the zeta function at zero.
the massive dirac operator k = a+im is non-hermitian, and one has k + = aim = k2im.
however, k +k = l + m2 is a positive self-adjoint second order laplace-like operator, and
binomial expansion gives

(s|k +k) = (s|l + m2) = (s|l) +



(1)j (s + j)m2j
xj=1

(s)j!

(s + j|l) .

(5.1)

it is plain that the functional determinant associated with l + m2 will play here an important
role.

let us begin with the even dimensional case, i.e. d = 2p. recall that, in this situation,
(s|a) = 0. splitting the sum in eq. (4.4) into even and odd terms and making use of eqs.
(3.8), it is easy to show that the latter gives a contribution of order o(s2). we can isolate the
singular term by writing

+(s|k) =

1

[1 + eis] ( s

(s|k +) =

[1 + eis] ( s

g(s) =

xj=1

(1)j (s + 2j) m2j

(2j)!

[1 + eis]

apj(l)
( s

.

it is easy to see that both (s) are regular at s = 0. taking derivatives at s = 0, we get

+(0|k) =

1

2 (cid:2) (0|l)  i(0|l)(cid:3) + g+(0) + g+(0) + +(0) ,

13

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

and a similar expression for (0|k +).

on the other hand, from (5.1), one readily has

1
2

(0|l + m2) =

1
2

(0|l) + g(0) + (0) ,

(5.7)

where g(0) = g(0) and analogously (0) = (0). comparing eqs. (5.6) and (5.7) we nally
obtain

+(0|k) =

(5.10)

the above formula may be useful in the actual evaluation of the derivative of the zeta function of
the massive dirac operator. here, again, the ambiguity depends on the seeley-dewitt coecient,
(0|l+m2), only. we should point out that, as it stands, the above equation is valid for arbitrary,
but nite, values of the mass m. this observation allows us to obtain a large mass expansion,
simply by recalling an asymptotic theorem due to voros [32], which states that, for large m, the
asymptotics of the massive laplacian are determined by the short asymptotics of its heat-kernel
trace. as a result, we have

(s|l + m2)

(5.12)

to summarize, we have reduced the problem of the rst order masiive dirac operator (in the
even dimensional case) to the much more familiar one for the simple laplacian operator l + m2,
and traced back the terms coming from the previous ambiguities (xed for m 6= 0) of the zeta
function denition, to the term involving the seeley-dewitt coecient (0|l + m2). our results
are in agreement with the ones obtained in [15], with a completely dierent method.

14

in the odd dimensional case, namely d = 2p + 1, the eta invariant is non-vanishing and we

have to refer to its meromorphic continuation given by the eq. (3.18). as a consequence,

+(0|k) =

(5.15)

(5.16)

thus, the meromorphic properties of (s|a  im) follow from the ones of the eta function. in
particular, one obtains

(im)2j+1

it should be noted the appearance of other two eta-like non local contributions. this,
again, is valid for arbitrary value of the mass m. also in the odd dimensional case, there is

15

agreement with the expressions obtained in [15], even though, in those papers, the extra non-
local contributions appeared in a dierent form. eq. (3.15) leads to

6 the multiplicative anomaly for the massive dirac operator
if four dimensions it is usually assumed that det k = det k + = det k +k (see, for example,
the recent papers [33]). however, a multiplicative anomaly may be present sometimes, what will
expoil the second equality, while the rst one could be spoiled by a phase of the determinant.
this has been recently discussed in detail in [34], where a very simple, specic example in which
this situation occurs has been given (see also the contribution [35]).

to begin with, it should be noted here that, strictly speaking, the wodzicki multiplicative
anomaly formula is not valid for dirac-like operators, since they are (rst order) non positive
operators. however, we still may apply the direct denition of the multiplicative anomaly, i.e.

a(k +, k) = ln det k +k  ln det k +  ln det k .

(6.1)

the determinant of the dierential operator k +k = l+m2 is dened through the zeta function
by

 ln det k +k =  ln det(l + m2) = (0|l + m2) ,

(6.2)

while for k and k + themselves, we have to set

 ln det k = +(0|k) ,

(6.3)
the choice + and  for k and k + respectively is a consequence of the discussion we have
carried out at the beginning of the previous section. now, we have

 ln det k + = 

(0|k +) .

proposition 2. for the regularized determinant one gets the nice property

which is valid for the determinant of non-hermitian matrices.

ln det k + = (ln det k),

16

coming back to the multiplicative anomaly, we obtain from eqs. (6.3), (5.8) and (5.9) a non
vanishing result, indeed

proposition 3. the multiplicative anomaly for the massive dirac operator and its adjoint, in

a space of even dimension d = 2p, reads

a2p(k +, k) = 2

(1)jm2jcj

j!

apj(l) .

p

(6.4)

proposition 4. the multiplicative anomaly for the massive dirac operator and its adjoint, in

a space of odd dimension d = 2p + 1, is given by

a2p+1(k +, k) = 

p

(1)j+1 m2j+1
xj=0
(j + 3
2 )

apj(l) .

(6.5)

apj(l) are the seeley-dewitt coecients corresponding to the operator l. of course, when
m  0 the multiplicative anomaly vanishes. directly in terms of the determinants of the dirac
operators, we can express our results as follows:

corollary 1. in the even dimensional case:

det k

det k +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)even
pdet(l + m2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)even

det k

= (1)(0|l+m2) ,

= (1) 1

2 (0|l+m2)  e 1

2 a2p(k +,k).

the rst of the terms in both expressions coincides with the one obtained by asada in the
mathematical literature [35] (after correction of a missprint there). moreover, we also agree
with the statement that the remaining anomaly contribution in our second result could only be
given by a linear combination of seeley-dewitt coecients as these terms are excluded from
the regularized denition of the zeta function determinant adopted in [35].

in the odd dimensional case, the eta function of the laplacian undertakes the role of the

zeta function, in fact, we have

corollary 2.

det k

det k +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)odd

det k

pdet(l + m2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)odd

7 some explicit examples

example 2. as a simple example of exact computation, let us consider the rst order operator
a = p  a, with p = i , acting on s1, and a a constant which can be interpreted as the
mean value of a unidimensional periodic vector potential. we may dene the domain of a as
consisting of periodic or antiperiodic functions with period 2. let us consider periodic (twisted)
spinors. the antiperiodic case is recovered through the replacement a  a + 1/2. the related
eta-function, for large re s, is

(s|a) = xn

n  a
|n  a|

(n  a)

the analytic extension near s = 0 can be obtained by using the spectral theorem,

a direct calculation gives

note that this is dened modulo k, k integer (i.e., it is a discontinuos and periodic function of a,
of period 1). this result is obtained from classical fourier analysis (see, e.g., [36]). on the other
hand (and this is actually non-trivial), the result (7.5) is the same that one obtains by analytical
from the corresponding
continuation of the eta function (s|a) to s = 0 what is clear, e.g.
expression to be found in [37].

furthermore, let us check the formula (3.24). for the sake of simplicity let us take 0 < a < 1,

but the analysis can be extended to a generic a. the spectral theorem gives

in the limit m   one gets (a  1/2), in complete agreement with the general result of sec.
5. eq. (3.25) is veried too.

example 3. as another example, let us consider a spinor eld dened on a riemann surface
of genus g > 1, namely a topologically non trivial 2-dimensional curved manifold with constant
curvature (see, for example, [38, 3]).

being this a 2-dimensional problem, it is sucient to deal with the spinorial laplacian.
recall that a riemannn surface is locally homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional hyperbolic plane
h 2. thus, making use of the half plane model for h 2, one has a metric tensor

g = y2 .

the covariant derivative for the 2-component spinor eld is given by

we shall deal with weyl spinors, namely the ones which are eigenvectors with eigenvalues 1
of 3. recall that a spinor structure can be introduced in the following way (see for example
[39, 40, 41]). let us consider a , containing the element 1 and such that /{} = . here

the two dimensional self-adjoint operators given by

d1 = y2(2

x + 2

y )  iyx

(7.15)

19

are the related spinorial laplacians, while the corresponding squares of the dirac operators
acting on the automorphic functions of weight 1 are given by l = d1  1/4, where the last
constant term comes from the constant curvature, normalized to minus one, of the riemann
surface. from now on, we shall consider only weyl spinors of weight 1.

as is known, we need the analytic continuation of the zeta function associated with the
dierential operator d1. such an analytic continuation can be obtained by means of the selberg
trace formula. in our case, it reads [39]

(0|l+ + m2) =

v (f )

according to the results of the previous sections, these formulas allow now for the explicit
evaluation of the functional determinants of the dirac operators a and a + im. finally we
would like to mention that in refs. [42, 43] one can nd other explicit examples of computation
of the eta invariant related to 3-dimensional compact hyperbolic manifolds.

8 conclusions

we have obtained in this paper explicit formulas for the zeta and etafunctions associated
with the massless and massive dirac operators in an arbitrary manifold without boundary, as
a rst step towards the calculation of the corresponding determinants, what has been done
subsequently. a number of explicit examples have then been considered. we have proceeded
with the calculation in complete rigor and detail, since both are necessary when trying to
elucidate the long standing issues concerning the phase of the dirac operator determinant and
the usual assumptions (in the physical literature) that the determinants for plus and minus im
are coinciding and equal on its turn to the square root of the massive laplacian determinant.

we have here settled down these issues (in the negative), once and for all, working all the time
in the zeta-function (and eta-function) domain and using both powerful mathematical theorems
and explicit formulas and calculations (including resummations of the mass expansions). our
main results are given in the form of several propositions that provide clear answers to the above
conjectures (see sec. 6).

a remarkable nding is the fact that, contrary to what had been ordinarily supposed, the
ambiguity present in the denition of the associated fermion functional determinant in the
massless case does actually disappear in the massive case. this gives rise to a phase of the dirac
determinant that agrees with a very recent calculation in the mathematical literature (after
an improvement of the last). our very explicit results for the multiplicative anomaly of the
determinants of the massive dirac operators (with +im and im, respectively) are also in full
agreement with recent calculations, in the overlapping situations. all those provide solid checks
of our method and of our nal formulas.

9 appendix

in this appendix, we shall consider a covenient algorithm, which is equivalent to the calculus of
dos, in order to construct a parametrix for the resolvents of dirac-like operators. we follow
the classical ref. [44] (see also [45]). for the sake of simplicity, let us consider k = a + im, as
a massive dirac operator on a at (compact) manifold. let us introduce the -symbol

(k) = ei

kx
 kei

kx
 = k(x, p + k

 ) , = p/  a/ +

k/


+ im,

(9.1)

where  is a real parameter, dened in order to determine recursively the parametrix. the
-symbol for the resolvent is given by

(cid:18)(k) 



(cid:19) r(; x, k) = i .

21

(9.2)

here, i is the identity operator and  a complex number. the parametrix for the symbol of the
complex power is obtained putting  = 1. it is given by

(ks)(x, k) =

1

2i z

dsr(x, k) ,

(9.3)

where  is a suitable cut in the  complex plane. recall that the fourier transform of (9.3)
gives the parametrix for the kernel of the complex power ks. one may solve eq. (9.2) with
the ansatz

r(; x, k) =

lrl(x, k) .



xl=1

(9.4)

as a result, one has the recurrence relations

(k/  )r1 = i ,

(k/  )rl + krl1 = 0 ,

l = 2, 3, ... .

(9.5)

thus, formally one obtaines

r(x, k) =

1

k/   (cid:18)i  k

1

k/  

1

1

+ k

k

k/  
1
k

k/  
1
k

1

k/  

k/  

k/  

k

+ ...(cid:19) .

(9.6)

the choice of the cut in the complex  plane depends on the meromorphic structure of r(x, k).
if k is hermitian, the poles are on the real axis and two possible inequivalent cuts can be chosen
in the lower or upper complex plane, as discussed in the introduction. if a mass is present or,
in general, the operator k is non-hermitian, the situation changes. as an illustration, we may
consider the free case, namely k (0) = p/ + im. a formal resummation gives

r(0)

 (x, k) =

1

k/ + im  

=

k/  im + 
k2  (im  )2 .

(9.7)

here the poles are located in the upper complex plane and one is forced to choose the lower cut
in eq. (9.3). this argument is also valid in the interacting case, because the free contribution
can be additively separated in eq. (9.6).

on the other hand, in the case of the adjoint operator k +, the only change is im  im
and it is plain that, in this case, the cut must be chosen in the upper complex  plane, as argued
in sec. 4.
