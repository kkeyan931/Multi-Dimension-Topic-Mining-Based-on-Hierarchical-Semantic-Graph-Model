abstract

we construct the eective theory of intersecting branes and investigate the bps
monopoles in the theory. the monopoles obtained are the generalization of nielsen-olesen
vortex. we study the properties of the solutions and interpret them as the d0-branes on
the brane-intersections.

1. introduction

the study of black hole physics is one of the most successful applications of string
theory. entropy of the black hole, known as bekenstein-hawking entropy [3], was derived
from an extremal one [1][2], and hawking radiation was also discussed [2]. similar argu-
ment was applied to 4-dimensional extremal black holes [5][6]. in these analyses, d-branes
played the crucial role.

there are black hole solutions in supergravity which is obtained from the d-brane
solutions and its entropy is zero. one such example is considered in [9]. it is obtained
from the solution which corresponds to intersecting d4-branes and d0-branes. from the
stringy argument, the entropy of this black hole should not be zero [5]. it was pointed
out that microstates which contribute to the entropy correspond to the monopole ground
states [9]. such monopoles can exist due to the appearance of the massless elds coming
from the string stretched between the intersecting d4-branes.

in this paper we generalize the eective theory on the intersection discussed in [9][10]
to the one which describes multi-intersections, and investigate the properties of the bps
monopole solutions in the theory. it will be identied with the d0-branes on the inter-
section.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we discuss briey the supergravity
solution and derive the entropy formula up to numerical factor. in section 3, we generaize
the eective theory on the intersection, and investigate the bps monopole solutions.
simple cases are discussed in detail. section 4 is devoted to the discussions.

2. black hole entropy and intersecting branes

2.1 supergravity solution

we will consider in this paper the following brane conguration in type iia theory
compactied on t 6. there are q1 d4-branes wrapped along, say, (4567) directions of t 6,
and q2 d4-branes wrapped along (6789) directions (we will denote this as d4-branes).
d4-branes and d4-branes intersect over a 3-dimensional hyperplane. there are also n
d0-branes on the intersection. this brane conguration preserves 1

8 supersymmetries.

the corresponding supergravity solution is known [4]. after dimensional reduction to
4 dimentions [8], this is regarded as a black hole solution.its metric in the einstein frame
and the dilaton eld are respectively as follows,

e = (1 + k) 1

e2(4) = (h1h2) 1

one can see that this black hole has zero-area horizon, indicating that its bekenstein-
hawking entropy is zero.

however, from the point of view of string theory, the entropy should not be zero. the
brane conguration described above is u-dual to the one which is s1 compactication of
the well-established d1-d5 system [1][2]. the entropy of the black hole corresponding
to the d1-d5 system was derived and this agrees completely to the bekenstein-hawking
entropy obtained from the supergravity solution. the method used in [1][2] depends only
on the dyamics on the branes. thus the same entropy formula should be valid when
one more direction is compactied. from u-duality invariance of entropy, it is natural to
expect that the entropy of the d4-d4-d0 system is

s = 2qq1q2n .

(3)

the emergence of the non-zero entropy is due to the following reason. one can see that
the dilaton eld (2) diverges at the horizon (r = 0). this implies that the quantities
related to the horizon will receive large quantum correction, and thus non-zero entropy
could appear [5].

2.2 d-brane description
the low energy eective theory on the d4-d4 intersection is 3-dimensional n = 4
supersymmetric gauge thoery. the gauge group is u(q1)u(q2). there are three hyper-
multiplets: one in the adjoint representation of u(q1), one in the adjoint representation
of u(q2), and one in the bi-fundamental representation of u(q1)u(q2). the d0-branes
will be described as bps monopoles, in the same way as the d0-branes are described as
instantons which preserve half of the supersymmetries in the d4-d0 system [7].

in the simplest case, q1 = q2 = 1, the adjoint hypermultiplets will decouple from
the dynamics and the resulting eective theory is n = 4 supersymmetric qed with a
charged hypermultiplet. the bosonic part of the lagrangian is

sboson = z d3x[

((qq  q q  )2 + 4|q q|2)  mm(qq + q q)]

(4)

diq = iq  iaiq, di q = i q + iai q
(i, j = 0, 1, 2, m = 1, 2, 3),

where m are the real scalars in the vector multiplet and q, q are the complex scalars in
the hypermultiplet.

we have introduced the fi-parameter . since the ground states of the d4-d4-
d0 system are marginal bound states, it may be dicult to investigate them by the
semiclassical argument. therefore we deformed the theory to make those states be truly

3

bound states. we expect that this deformation does not change drastically the properties
of the monopoles. similar arguments have been done in [10].

the eective theory (4) has static monopole solutions known as nielsen-olesen vortex
[11]. this solution breaks 4 supersymmetries, thus one-monopole solution has 4(= 22)
ground states.

the entropy of the d4-d4-d0 system can be obtaind by counting the ground states
of n monopoles. assume that d4(d4)-branes are separated from each other. then the
number of ground states is equal to the number of distributing the n d0-branes among
the 2q1q2 bosonic states and 2q1q2 fermionic states. this can be easily calculated and
the resulting entropy is

sstat = 2s 1

6

(2q1q2 +

(5)

this agrees with (3) up to numerical factor.

3. generalized vortex

now we consider q1, q2  1 case. again, for simplicity, assume that d4(d4)-branes
are separated from each other. this corresponds in gauge theory language to turning on
the vev of the adjoint hypermultiplet scalars, and therefore the gauge group u(q1)u(q2)
is broken to u(1)q1  u(1)q2. as we have seen in the q1 = q2 = 1 case, bps monopoles
will be described by the gauge elds and the bi-fundamental hypermultiplet scalars. the
relevant part of the eective theory action is therefore as follows,

the monopole solutions must satisfy this conditions at spatial innity.

then we investigate the static bps monopole solutions which preserve half of the

supersymmetries. the staic energy of the system is

these equations are the generalization of the well-known nielsen-olesen vortex equations
[11]. one can verify that the solutions to (11) preserve half of the supersymmetries, if we
choose the same signs for all n and m.

3.1 the simplest case: q1 = 2, q2 = 1

we will consider the simplest case in which there are two d4-branes and a d4-brane,
thus there are two intersections. in the following, we will take the lower sign in (11), which
corresponds to investigating the positive-charge monopole solutions. the bps equations
are the following.

f (1)
1,12 = g2(|q11|2 + )
f (1)
2,12 = g2(|q21|2 + )
f (2)
1,12 = g2(|q11|2 + |q21|2  2)
(1q11 + i(a(1)
1,1  a(2)
(1q21 + i(a(1)
2,1  a(2)
we redene the elds as follows.

1,1)q11)  i(2q11 + i(a(1)
1,1)q21)  i(2q21 + i(a(1)

1,2  a(2)

a = a(1)

f = 1a2  2a1,
q = q11,

1,

2,  a(2)
a = a(1)
f = 1 a2  2 a1
q = q21

after suitable rescaling, we obtain

f = 2|q|2  |q|2 + 3
f = |q|2  2|q|2 + 3

(1q + ia1q)  i(2q + ia2q) = 0
(1 q + i a1 q)  i(2 q + i a2 q) = 0

the original gauge elds are determined by the use of the condition

1,12 + f (1)
f (1)

2,12 + f (2)

1,12 = 0.

(13)

(14)

(17)

(18)
(19)
(20)
(21)

(22)

first we discuss the topological properties of the solutions. the boundary conditions

at innity (|q|  1, dq  0) lead

then the magnetic charge is

q  ei, a  .

2 z d2xf =

(( = 2)  ( = 0)).

(23)

(24)

for the single-valuedness of q, the rhs of (24) is an integer n. similar result holds for
q, a and its magnetic charge is another integer n. the energy of this solution is

e =

1
2

(n + n)

6

(25)

this shows that the solution is stable due to its topological property.

next we consider the radially symmetric solutions with magnetic charge n and n.

suppose the following ansatz.

q = f (r)ein, a = x
q = f (r)ein,
a = x

a(r)

n
r2
n
r2 a(r)

(26)

(r, ) is the polar coordinates. this reduces (18)(21) to the ordinary dierential equa-
tions.

the boundary conditions are then

f, f  1, a, a  1 (r  ).

(28)

(29)

(30)

now we argue the global property of the solutions. it is natural to expect that for the
positive-charge monopole solutions f, f  0, where f = n
dr etc. this means that a, a
are monotonically increasing functions. from (30), we can see that a, a  1. integrating
(28) and use the boundary value of f , we obtain

log f (r) = z

n(1  a())

(31)

the rhs is always negative, indicating that 0  f  1. especially, since a(0) < 1
the rhs must diverge at r = 0. this means f (0) = 0. similar argument leads to
a(0) < 1, f(0) = 0.

such a solution can exist around r = 0. it is useful to dene h(r) = n(1  a(r)) etc.

the solution is

f (r) = crn + o(rn+1)
f(r) = crn + o(rn+1)

h(r) = n 
h(r) = n

(32)
(33)

(34)

(35)

where m = max(n, n). c, c are non-zero constants.

assuming that such solutions exist globally, one can calculate the dimension of the
moduli space mn,n of the monopole solutions with charges (n, n). from the ordinary
index calculation, we obtain
(36)

dimrmn,n = 2(n + n)

7

this can be interpreted as follows. remember that the system considered here is the
brane conguration with two intersections. therefore the solutions with charges (n, n)
correspond to the conguration in which n d0-branes are on one intersection, and n
d0-branes are on another intersection. the moduli will correspond to the positions of
d0-branes on each intersection.

we expect that the above arguments can be extended to the q1  3, q2 = 1 case.
3.2 q1 = q2 case

now we consider more general case: q1 = q2 = q. the properties of the solutions will
be similar to the previous case. from the single-valuedness of qnm, the magnetic charges
are quantized,

where

1

2 z d2xfnm = lnm  z
fnm = f (1)

n,12  f (2)
m,12.

one can easily see that all lnms are not independent. they obey

lnm + ln+1,m+1 = ln+1,m + ln,m+1.

then the simplest charge distributions which satisfy (39) are, for q = 2,

  l11

l21

l12

l22 ! =   1 0

1 0 ! ,   1 1

0 0 ! etc.

the d0-brane interpretation of the solutions (40) are as follows. consider again the
original non-abelian theory. the number of the d0-branes n should be given as

n =

1

2 z d2x(trf (1)

12  trf (2)
12 ),

(41)

12 + trf (2)

(trf (1)
the number of the d0-branes is given as

12 = 0 for the bps solutions). thus in the abelian theory discussed above

the distributions (40) then corresponds to n = 1. general solutions will be obtained
as the superpositions of such simple solutions, and there will exist the solution for all

8

n. therefore the bps monopole solutions can be interpreted as the d0-branes on the
intersections.

4. discussions

we have constructed the eective thoery on the d4-d4 intersections in which all
d4(d4)-branes are separated from each other, and studied the properties of the bps
monopole solutions in the theory. the solutions allow us to interpret them as the d0-
branes on the intersections. in q1 = 2, q2 = 1 case, there is evidence for the existence of
the monopole solutions, and its moduli will correspond to the positions of d0-branes on
the intersections. in more general cases, it is argued that there may exist the monopoles
corresponding to any number of the d0-branes.

in contrast to the case in the previous paper [9], the derivation of the entropy by
counting the ground states of the bps monopoles is less straightforward in the present
context. as we have seen in the q1 = q2 = 2 case, the unit solutions will be (40). it is
hard to interpret them as a d0-brane on a particular intersection. this means that the
number of states which contribute to the entropy might be less than what is expected.
we think that these missing states are recovered, because the moduli space of the unit
solution (40) will be larger than the one obtained in the q1 = q2 = 1 case, and these
solutions will have larger number of ground states than one might think.

thus we can think that the description discussed in this paper is an intermediate step
toward the construction of quantum mechanics of the black hole. when we consider the
non-abelian theory, the only quantum number that labels bps states will be the number
of the d0-branes. then all solutions are included in a moduli space and cannot be counted
individually. it is possible, in principle, to construct quantum mechanics of the black hole
as -model whose target space is the moduli space of the bps monopole solutions. the
microstates which contribute to the entropy will be obtained as the ground states, which
corresponds to the cohomology elements of the moduli space. moreover the dynamics of
the -model will describe the physics of the near-extremal black hole.
