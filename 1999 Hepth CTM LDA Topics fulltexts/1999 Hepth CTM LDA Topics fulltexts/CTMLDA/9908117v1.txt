abstract

coherent states have three main properties: coherence, overcompleteness and in-
trinsic geometrization. these unique properties play fundamental roles in eld theory,
especially, in the description of classical domains and quantum uctuations of physical
elds, in the calculations of physical processes involving innite number of virtual parti-
cles, in the derivation of functional integrals and various eective eld theories, also in
the determination of long-range orders and collective excitations, and nally in the explo-
ration of origins of topologically nontrivial gauge elds and associated gauge degrees of
freedom.

1 introduction

in the past thirty-six years, the developments and applications of coherent states
have been made tremendous progress. yet, the idea of creating a coherent state for
a quantum system was conceived well before that. in fact, back in 1926, schrodinger
rst proposed the idea of what is now called coherent states [1] in connection with
the quantum states of classical motion for a harmonic oscillator. in other words, the
coherent states were invented immediately after the birth of quantum mechanics.
however, between 1926 and 1962, activities in this eld remained almost dormant,
except for a few works in condensed matter physics [2, 3, 4] and particle physics
[5, 6] in 50s. it was not until some thirty ve years after schrodingers pioneering
paper that the rst modern and systematic application to eld theory was made
by glauber and sudarshan [7, 8] and launched this fruitful and important eld of
study in theoretical as well as experimental physics.

i became interested in the subject of coherent states about fteen years ago. on
the occasion of prof. sudarshan visiting suzhou of china (1984), i listened for the
rst time in life a topic on coherent states presented by prof. sudarshan. as a
second-year graduate student at that time, i was looking for some research problem
on collective excitations in strongly interacted many-body systems (particularly in
nuclear physics). prof. sudarshans lecture inspired me to think whether under con-
straint(s) of dynamical symmetries collective excitations can be described in terms

of coherent states, as a result of multi-particle correlations (coherence). later on
i realized, this is indeed a very active subject covering problems from condensed
matter physics to nuclear and particle physics. of course, these coherent states have
no longer the simple but beautiful form glauber and sudarshan proposed for light
beams. actually, these states are generated by complicated collective composite
operators of particle-particle pairs or particle-hole pairs. their mathematical struc-
ture were already developed in early 70s by perelomov and gilmore [9, 10] based
on the theory of lie groups. newdays, the concept of coherent states has been
extensively investigated. many methods based on coherent states have also been
developed for various theoretical problems. nevertheless, the original development
of coherent states in quantum electromagnetic eld (or more precisely, in the study
of quantum optical coherence) has made tremendous inuence in physics.

one can nd that a large body of the literature on coherent states has appeared.
this vast literature was exhaustively collected, catalogued and classied by klauder
and skagerstam [11]. about the mathematical usefulness of coherent states as a new
tool to study the unitary representations of lie groups has been described in a well
expository book by perelomov [12]. a review article on the theory of coherent
states and its applications that cover subjects of quantum mechanics, statistical
mechanics, nonlinear dynamics and many-body physics has also been presented by
author and his collaborators [13]. in this article, i will only concentrate on the topic
of coherent states in eld theory. as usual, it is not my intention to give a complete
review about coherent states in eld theory. an extensive review on coherent states
in eld theory and particle physics may be found in [14]. i will rather like to present
here a discussion on whether one can formulate eld theory in terms of coherent
states such that the new formulation may bring some new insights to the next
development of eld theory in the new millennium. coherent state can become
a useful and important subject in physics because of its three unique properties:
the coherence, the overcompleteness and the intrinsic geometrization. these unique
properties, in certain contents, are fundamental to eld theory. i will select some
typical topics in eld theory that can be eciently described by coherent states
based on these properties. these topics include the productions of coherent states
in eld theory, the basic formulation of quantum eld theory in terms of coherent
state functional integrals, the spontaneously symmetry breaking described from
coherent states, and the eective eld theories derived from coherent states. also, i
will sprinkle discussions about the geometrical phases of coherent states and their
interpretation as gauge degrees of freedom in eld theory, a subject which has still
received increasing importance in ones attempt to understand the fundamental of
nature.

2 photon coherent states

i may begin with the simplest coherent state of photons, or more generally speaking,
bosons. such a set of coherent states has been described in most of quantum
mechanics text books and are familiared to most of physicists. it is indeed the most

2

popular coherent state that has been used widely in various elds. the coherent
state of photons can describe not only the coherence of electromagnetic eld, but
also many other properties of bosonic elds.
it is the basis of modern quantum
optics [15], and it also provides a fundamental framework to quantum eld theory,
as one will see later.

by means of optical coherence, one may consider the n-th order correlation

function of electromagnetic eld:
gn(x1,   , xn, xn+1,   , x2n) = tr{e(x1)   e(xn)e+(xn+1)   e+(x2n)}, (1)
where xi is the time-space coordinates,  denotes the density operator, and e(xi)
represent the electric eld operators with positive and negative frequency. for
simplication, the polarization of electric eld is xed. according to glauber [7]
the complete coherence of a radiation eld is that all of the correlation functions
satisfy the following factorization condition:

gn(x1,   , xn, xn+1,   , x2n) = e (x1)  e (xn)e(xn+1)  e(x2n).

(2)

this condition implies electric eld operators must behave like classical eld vari-
ables. it may also indicate the electric eld operator should have its own eigenstates
with the corresponding classical eld variables as its eigenvalues:
h|e(xi) = h|e (xi).

e+(xi)|i = e(xi)|i ,

(3)

moreover, the density operator must also be expressed in terms of the eigenstates
|i. obviously, the conventional fock space in quantum theory does not obey the
above condition.
this is actually a nontrivial problem, because it requires a complete description
of classical motions in terms of quantum states. meantime, the operator e(xi)
itself is not a hermitian operator. the eigenstate problem of a nonhermitian op-
erator is unusual in quantum mechanics. fortunately, such quantum states have
already been constructed by schrodinger soon after his invention of quantum me-
chanics in 1926. in order to answer the question how microscopic dynamics transits
to macroscopic world, schrodinger looked for quantum states which follow precisely
the corresponding classical trajectories all the time, and meantime, the states must
also be the exact solution of quantum dynamical equation (i.e., the schrodinger
equation). but only for harmonic oscillator, such states were constructed [1]:

z(x)  expn 

1
2

(x + z)2o,

(4)

where z is a complex variable. these states are actually the gaussian wave packets
centered on the classical trajectory z = (x+ip), x and p are the position of harmonic
oscillator in the phase space that satises classical equations of motion. one can
show that eq. (4) is also an exact solution of schrodinger equation. the classicality
of gaussian wave packets are manifested by the minimum uncertainty relationship:

x2p2 =

h2
4

and p = x.

(5)

3

in other words, the wave packets governed by the hamiltonian of harmonic oscillator
follow classical trajectories and do not spread in time .

glauder and sudarshan discovered [7, 8] that such a wave packet is a superpo-
sition of fock states. it is also an eigenstate of e+(xi). in quantum eld theory,
electromagnetic eld consists of innite harmonic oscillating modes (photons). ex-
plicitly, the hamiltonian of quantum electromagnetic eld (in coulomb gauge) is
given by

h = 

1

2 z d3xne2 + b2o,

(6)

where e and b are the electric and magnetic elds. the electromagnetic eld can
be expressed by the vector potential a : e = a/t, b =  a. it is convenient
to expand the vector potential in terms of plane waves (fourier series)

a(x, t) = z

d3k

q(2)32k x na

k~(k)eikx + a

k ~(k)eikxo,

(7)

where ~(k) is the polarization vector of electromagnetic eld, and (a
creation and annihilation operators,

k , a

k) are the

[a

k , a

k ] = kk,

[a

k , a

k ] = [a

k , a

k ] = 0.

then the hamiltonian of electromagnetic eld can be deduced to

k(a

k a

k + 1/2),

h = xk

(8)

(9)

which means that the electromagnetic eld consists of innite individual electro-
magnetic modes, i.e., photons. each photon corresponds to a harmonic oscillator.
in the particle number representation, the gaussian wave packet can be written

as

|zi = exp(

1
2|z|2) exp(za)|0i.

(10)

where |0i is the vacuum state: a|0i = 0. from the above expression, it is easy to
show that the wave packet is also an eigenstate of the annihilation operator a:

thus, the quantum state describing the optical coherence of electromagnetic eld
can be expressed by

a|zi = z|zi,

(11)

k}i = expn 
|{z

1

2 z d3kx |z

k|2o expnz d3kx

k o|0i,
k a
z

(12)

which is an eigenstate of the positive frequency part of the electric eld operator,

e+(x)|{z

k}i = e(x)|{z

k}i ,

d3k

(2)3/2r k

2 x

z
k ~(k)ei(ktkx). (13)

e(x) = iz

besides, the above state has another very important property:
following resolution of identity:

it supports the

z |{z

k}ih{z

k}|yk

dz

k dz
k
2

= i.

(14)

in other words, these states in the complex space (in terms of the variable z) form
a complete set of states (more precisely speaking, it is overcomplete because of
the continuity of these states). this complete set is certainly very dierent from
the set of fock states. because of the overcompleteness and the analyticity of these
states, one can expand the density operator by (12) in a diagonal form (the so-called
p-representation [7]):

 = z p ({z

k})|{z
tr = z p ({z

k}ih{z
k})yk

k}|yk
k dz

dz

dz

k dz
k ,

k = 1.

(15)

where p (z) is a weight function.
in terms of these states (12), the factorization
criterion of coherent light beams is automatically satised. glauber named such
states the coherent states. to be more specic, one may call them the photon
coherent states. physically, the photon coherent states have a well-dened phase
for each mode. therefore, coherent light beams can be completely described in
quantum mechanics in terms of photon coherent states. for these who wish to have
more detailed discussion on physical consequences of the photon coherent states in
quantum optics, please refer to the excellent book by klauder and sudarshan [15].

3 coherent states and s-matrix

as we have seen, the photon coherent state was introduced by the requirement of
optical coherence. here, i may ask a more general question, namely, how are photon
coherent states generated in eld theory? in eld theory, all physical quantities
are derivable from the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude in the presence of
external sources. it can show that the nal state in such processes is a coherent
state if there is no other interactions except for a linear interaction with the external
eld.

to be specic, one may consider the electromagnetic eld interacting with a

classical source:

l = 

1
4

ff   aj,

(16)

where the classical source is a conserved current: j = 0. in the feynman gauge,
the equation of motion for the electromagnetic eld is given by

a general solution of the above equation is

f  = 2a = j.

a(x) = a

0 (x) +z d4y(x  y)j(y),

5

(17)

(18)

where a
0 (x) is the solution of free eld, and (x  y) is the green function deter-
mined by 2x(x  y) = 4(x  y). if one assumes that the interaction is switched
on adiabatically in a nite time interval, then

a(x) = a

in(x) +z d4yret(x  y)j(y)
out(x) +z d4yadv(x  y)j(y),

= a

where the retarded and advanced green functions are given by

ret

adv

(x) = 

1

(2)4 z d4p

eipx

(p0  i)2  p2 ,

(19)

(20)

in and a

and a
out are free elds describing the photon eld before and after its
interaction with the classical course j. the corresponding photon states are the
in- and out-states (denoted by |iin and |iout, respectively). the in- and out-states
form two complete sets of free states constructed as a fock space by the free eld
operators a
out. therefore, there must exist a unitary transformation s
(namely s-matrix) to connect these two complete sets:

in and a

a

out = sa

ins ,

|iout = s|iin.

from (19), one can see that

a

out(x) = a
= a

in(x) +z d4y[ret(x  y)  adv(x  y)]j(y)
in(x) + a

cl(x),

(21)

(22)

and a
cl(x) is a c-number (classical) eld generated by the classical current j(x).
notice that adv(x) ret(x) = (x) which relates to the commutator of free elds
[a
out(y)] = ig(x  y). one may check that the
s-matrix can be written as

in(y)] = [a

out(x), a

in(x), a

s = expn  iz d4xain  j(x)o = expn  iz d4xaout  j(x)o.

(23)

if we start at time  from the vacuum state |0iin, the nal state after the free
eld a(x) interacted with the classical current j(x) becomes a coherent state:

|0iout = expniz d4xain(x)  j(x)o|0iin.

in terms of the fourier expansion,

a(x) = z

d3k

q2(2)2|k| x na

k

(k)eikx + a

 (k)eikxo.
k 

the nal state can be expressed as

|0iout = expn

2 z d3kx |z

k|2o expnz d3kx

k o|0iin = |{z
k a
z
k}i,

6

(24)

(25)

(26)

where z
k = (k)  j(k), and j(k) is the fourier transform of the classical current
j(x). this is the same photon coherent states introduced by glauber in the study
of quantum optical coherence.

indeed, one can derive similarly the photon coherent state for the laser beams
(discussed in the previous section) from a more microscopic picture. the hamil-
tonian in quantum optics that describes the interaction between n atoms and the
electromagnetic eld can be written as:

h = xk

ka

kak +xi

ii

0 +xk,i

ki(t)( i
+n

ak +

i
n

a

k),

(27)

where ki are the coupling coecients between atoms and electromagnetic eld.
one of the crucial assumptions made in the construction of the above hamiltonian
for laser beams is that each of the n atoms, labeled by the index i, is a two-
level system and therefore its dynamical variables are the usual pauli operators
{i
}. furthermore, the atomic variables can be treated as a classical source
(i.e. the spin operators i can be regarded as c-numbers), and the coupling strength
ki are identical for all the atoms (i.e. ki = k). then, eq. (27) is reduced to

+, i

0, i

h = xk

kak +xi
kak +xk hk(t)a
k + 

ak + hi

ki(t)(hi

k(t)aki + const.

a

k)

(28)

this corresponds to the electromagnetic eld interacting with an external time
dependent source. the general solution of the schrodinger equation for this hamil-
tonian is the photon coherent states. this provides the microscopic picture how the
photon coherent state is generated and why it becomes the fundamental of quantum
optics.

soon after the development of coherent states in optical coherence, it was found
that the photon coherent state also plays an important role in solving the infrared
divergence in quantum electrodynamics for electron scatterings [16, 17, 18, 19,
20] (also see the review by papanicolaou [21]). as it is well known, the matrix
element in quantum electrodynamics for the scattering of an initial state containing
a nite number of electrons and photon into a similar nal state has a logarithmical
infrared divergence for the small momentum k [22]. this is because in an actual
scattering experiment, electromagnetic elds interact with the source particles so
that an innite number of soft photons are emitted. these emitted soft photons
form a coherent state to the nal state, as we have discussed. to be more specic,
consider a single electron scattering. the source particle can be represented by a
classical current. the fourier transform of the classical current is given by

j(k) =

ie

q2(2)3|k|(cid:16) p
pf  k 

f

p
i

pi  k(cid:17),

(29)

where pi,f are the electrons momentum in the initial and nal states. if one sums
the cross sections over all possible nal states containing any number of soft photons

7

with momenta below the threshold of observability [by using the photon coherent
state (26) with the above classical source], the infrared divergence is canceled. this
gives a beautiful solution to the infrared problem in quantum electrodynamics.

moreover, one can also show that if the matrix element for scatterings are calcu-
lated with the initial and nal states containing innite number of soft photons by
the photon coherent state, the infrared divergences are canceled order by order at
matrix element level (not only in cross sections) [16]. the photon coherent stat may
also use to remove the similar infrared problem in quantum gravity, as noticed by
weinberg [23]. these are perhaps the second important applications of the photon
coherent state in eld theory. in addition, one has also attempted to use coherent
states to treat infrared divergences in non-abelian gauge theory [24]. however, in the
non-abelian gauge theory, the infrared divergence is much more complicated [25, 26].
it contains two-type infrared divergences, the massless soft infrared divergence and
collinear divergence.
it is not clear whether one can construct some non-abelian
coherent states to handle both the soft and collinear infrared divergences.

4 functional integrals in eld theory

when the quantum elds interact with quantum elds rather than classical external
elds, the s-matrix (or the time-evolution operator) does not generate coherent
states from the incoming vacuum.
in such cases, coherent states are useful in
the derivation of functional integral in eld theory. quantum eld theory can be
reformulated in terms of coherent states not only because of its classicality and
being eigenstates of the annihilation operator. as we have mentioned, the coherent
states are overcomplete:

z |zihz|

dzdz

2

= i.

(30)

all these three properties (the classicality, the eigenstates of the positive frequency
part of eld operator and the overcompleteness) together allow one to reformulate
quantum eld theory in terms of a functional integral. actually, the content of this
section can be found in many text books, but for completeness i will repeat these
discussions here.

the ordinary path integral of quantum mechanics developed by feynman [27]

can be obtained from the evolution operator by writing the evolution operator as

and then inserting a resolution of the identity in terms of the position states

u(tf , t0) = expn  ih(tf  t0)o = lim
z dx|xihx| = i

n(cid:16) exp nih

tf  t0
n o(cid:17)n

(31)

(32)

between the terms of above product. this results in the familiar path integral of
quantum mechanics,

hx(tf )|x(t0)i = hx|u(tf , t0)|xi

= z [dx(t)] expniz tf

t0

dtl(x(t), x(t))o,

(33)

8

where l is a classical lagrangian which generally has a form of

l(x, x) =

1

2(cid:16)dx
dt(cid:17)2

 v (x),

(34)

and [dx(t)]  qt0ttf dx(t) is a functional measure of the path integration [28].

instead of using the basis of the position eigenstates (32), we may use the co-
herent state basis and insert the resolution of identity (30) between the terms of
product (31). then a phase space formulation of path integrals can be obtained as
was rst proposed by klauder [6, 30] (more detailed derivation will be given later
in the application to eld theory),

hz(tf )|z(t0)i = hz|u(tf , t0)|zi
dp(t)

= z [dx(t)][

2

] expniz tf

t0

dtl(x(t), p(t))o,

with

l(x, p) = hz|i

=

1

d
dt|zi  hz|h|zi
dx
dt  x

dp

dt(cid:17)  h(x, p).

(35)

(36)

where z = (x + ip)/2 and z = (x  ip)/2, with the initial and nal positions

x(t0) and x(tf ) xed. this derivation of feynmans path integral is particularly
useful in obtaining a functional integral of quantum eld theory.

to derive a functional integral of quantum eld theory, we may start with a
neutral scalar eld (x), for simplication. the lagrangian density of a neutral
eld is given by

l =

[()2  m22]  v (),

(37)

1
2

where v () represents a self-interacting potential, such as 
4! 4(x). the canonical
momentum density conjugate to (x, t) is determined by (x, t) = l/ (x, t).
then the canonical quantization leads to

[op(x, t), op(x, t)] = i3(x  x),

in the plane-wave expansion, one has

op(x, t) = z
op(x, t) = iz

d3k

(2)3/2s 1
(2)3/2r k

2knakeikx + a

here :

2 z d3k |zk|2o expnz d3k (zka

= expn 

1

k)o|0i,

(41)

from which a functional integral of eld theory can be derived explicitly. note that
the coherent state in eld theory is dened at a given instant time t over the whole
space {x} .
since the hamiltonian formalism of eld theory is the same as in quantum me-
chanics, one can directly calculate the time greens function dened as the matrix
element of the evolution operator in coherent state basis,

g(tf , t0) = h|u(tf , t0)|i = h|t expn  iz tf

t0

dth(t)o|i,

(42)

where t is the time-ordering operator. one may slice the time interval tf  t0 into
n equal segments:  = (tf  t0)/n so that in the sense of n  , the evolution
operator can be written as a subsequently multiplication of the evolution operator
in the interval :

u(tf , t0) = expn  ih(tn)o expn  ih(tn1)o

   expn  ih(t2)o expn  ih(t1)o.

(43)

using the same procedure as in the derivation of feynmans path integral in quan-
tum mechanics, one should insert the resolution of identity,

(50)

as we see that the coherent state gives a natural derivation of path integrals in eld
theory.

in eld theory, the correlations between n elds are dened by the n-point green

functions,

g(n)(x1,   , xn) = h0|t ((x1)   (xn))|0i,

which can be determined from the generating functional w (j) which is dened as
the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude in the presence of external current j(x):

this generating functional can then be expressed in terms of the time greens

w (j) = h0|u(,)|0ij.

(51)

function g(tf , t0) by adding a term r d3xj(x)(x) in the exponent and then taking

(52)

and z(j) is a functional partition function in quantum eld theory. the n-point
greens functions containing only the connected graphs is given by,

g(n)
c (x1,   , xn) =

(i)n
w (j)

nw (j)

j(x1)   j(xn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0

= (i)n1

nz(j)

j(x1)   j(xn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0

.

(53)
taking the stationary phase approximation of w (j) naturally results in the
classical equations of motions [29, 30]. on the other hand, after integrating out
the (x) eld, the functional integrals w (i) and z(j) become covariant. now, all
physical quantities in eld theory are, in principle, derivable from w (j) or z(j)
in a covariant form, which are standard in text books. i should not repeat these
discussion here.

the above formulation is only for bosonic elds. field theory that describes
the real world must also involve fermion (matter) elds. to formulate a similar

11

functional integral for fermionic elds, one needs to introduce fermion coherent
states. similarly, one may try to construct such a coherent state as an eigenstate
of the fermion annihilation operator:

ci|i = i|i ,

{ci, c

j} = ij.

(54)

however, since the fermion creation and annihilation operators satisfy the anticom-
mutation relationship, the eigenvalue i of the annihilation operator is its classical
analogy which cannot be an ordinary number. the quantum-classical corresponding
principle simply requires that i must be anticommute:

ij = ji

,

i

j =

i = 0.

(55)

the numbers satises the above relations are called grassmann numbers. functions
of grassmann numbers are given by

f (i) = f 0 + f (1)

i i + f (2)

ij ij +    ,

and the grassmann integrals are dened as

z d = 0 ,

z d = 1.

(56)

(57)

using these properties, the fermionic coherent state can be written explicitly as

|i = expn

2 xi



i io expnic

io|0i,

(58)

where |0i is the fermion vacuum state: ci|0i = 0. for the fermionic coherent states,
the resolution of identity can be written similarly as

z yi

d

i i|ih| = i.

(59)

based on these properties of fermionic coherent states, the functional integral of
fermion elds is rather easy to derive [31]. consider a fermion eld  coupling with
a scalar boson eld , the lagrangian is

l(, , ) = (i 6   m) +

1
2

[()2  m22]  g.

following the same procedure, one obtains the functional integral

w (, , j) = z [d][d][d] expnz d4xhl(, , ) +  +  + jio,

(60)

(61)

where the fermionic sources  ,  are also grassmann numbers. in fact, schwinger
rst introduced such a generating functional for fermion elds, in order to derive
the fermion eld greens functions [5].

these results can be extended to quantum electrodynamics and quantum chro-
modynamics, although the later will be more complicated because of non-abelian

12

gauge elds [32, 33]. in most of text books, the discussions on coherent states in
eld theory are restricted usually in contents of the above formulation. one may
derive from such a formulation almost everything about perturbative eld theory,
such as feynman rules, the perturbation expansion, and renormalization analysis,
etc. at this point, the functional integral of quantum eld theory in terms of coher-
ent states is actually nothing special. it is the standard formulation that one can
also obtain from other methods. if the eld theory can be treated perturbatively,
one can always solve the theory in one or other ways, based on the developments of
eld theory in the last fty years. the challenge in eld theory we faced today (or in
the past three decades since the theory of the strong interaction, namely quantum
chromodynamics, was proposed) is in the nonperturbation section. there is no a
systematic approach in eld theory that one can used to completely solve a non-
perturbation problem, such as the vacuum structure in non-abelian gauge theory,
or bound state problem in strongly coupling systems. in the next few sections, i
will try to illustrate some specic problems to see if the generalized coherent states
developed later can play some useful roles to the nonperturbation eld theory of
strongly interacted systems.

5 squeezed coherent states and quantum fluc-
tuations

the rst example i go to discuss is how one may use squeezed states to study the
low energy quantum uctuations in strong interaction theory. dierent from what
is discussed in the previous section where the content may be found in text books,
here i should point out that the formulation presented in this section has actually
not been completed yet, and more work remains for further investigations.

the squeezed states are a generalization of photon coherent states. aagin, the
squeezed states rst attracted the attention in quantum optics [34, 35]. in the early
development, the principal potential applications of squeezed states are in the eld
of optical communications and quantum nondemolition experiments designed for
the detection of gravity waves [36]. later on, because of the capacity of treating
quantum uctuations, squeezed states have been used in various subjects, such as
quantum measurement theory, quantum nonlinear dynamics, molecular dynamics,
dissipative quantum mechanics as well as in quantum gravity and condensed matter
physics.

in quantum optics, the uncertainty principle places a damper on the enthusiasm
with which quantum engineers approach the problem of coding and transmitting
information by optical means. specically, the quantum noise inherent in light
beams places a limit on the information capacity of an optical beam. since the
uncertainty principle is a statement about areas in phase space, noise levels in
dierent quadratures are statements about intersections of uncertainty ellipses with
these axes. any procedure which can deform or squeeze the uncertainty circle to an
ellipse can in principle be used for noise reduction in one of the quadratures. such
squeezing does not violate the uncertainty principle; rather, it places the larger

13

uncertainty in a quadrature not involved in the information transmission process.
a typical procedure for squeezing the error ellipse involves applying a classical
source to drive two photon emission and absorption processes in much the same
way that single photon processes can be used to generate a coherent state of the
electromagnetic eld.

for simplication, one may consider a basic hamiltonian describing two photon

processes in a single mode

1

h = (cid:16)aa +

2(cid:17) + f (t)a2 + f (t)a2.

then, the squeezed state can be obtained by directly solving the time dependent
schrodinger equation. if the initial state is the photon vacuum, a general solution
is

(62)

(63)

|i = exp(cid:16) 1

a2(cid:17)|0iei.

this is the squeezed states generated by eq.(62). if one denes the photons position
and momentum coordinates (x, p) in terms of the creation and annihilation operators
as in the previous section, one can then nd that

x2 = h|x2|i =
p2 = h|p2|i =

and x 6= p but xp  1

exp(cid:16) 1

in general, it is desirable to squeeze a eld coherent state which can be generated

so that quantum uctuation (noise) can be reduced in one of the quadratures.

(65)

the sequence in which the processes of coherent state formation and squeezing occur
is governed by the time dependence of the functions f2(t) and f1(t). the general
form of the state at the time t can be expressed (apart from a phase factor) by

|zi = exp(cid:16)za  za(cid:17) exp(cid:16) 

2

a2 


2

a2(cid:17)|0i,

(66)

where the complex variables z and  are functions of the time t in general. eq. (66)
is usually called squeezed coherent state. the physical process of the squeezed
coherent states can be understood as follows: by rst squeezing the vacuum (the
wave packet) by the two photon excitations, and then displacing it as a photon
coherent state by the external source.

using group theory, one can show that the squeezed coherent states must also

form a overcomplete set of states.

(68)

these two variables relate to the squeezing parameter  by (64). by the complete-
ness, one can also derive a path integral of quantum mechanics in the squeezed

(70)

the expression of path integral in squeezed coherent states shows that f and g which
characterize quantum uctuations become a pair of conjugate variables. the ex-
tremal values of the exponent in the path integral leads to the following generalized
equations of motion:

dx
dt
df
dt

= he /p ,
= he /g ,

dp

= he /x ,
= he /f .

(71)

physically, the equations of motion for (x, p) determine the time evolution of the
center of wave packets and those for f, g characterize the time evolution of the
quantum uctuations (quadratures). therefore, the variables (f, g) describe the
squeezing and spreading of quadratures in times, which provides a classical-like
dynamical theory for the controlling of quantum noise and signal.

it is worth pointing out that although the concept of squeezed state rst attracted
the attention in quantum optics, squeezed state itself was introduced much earlier
by valatin and bulter in the study of superuidity [4, 38]. similar to the bcs state
of superconductivity (which i will discuss later), valatins superuid ground state
is dened as

(73)

then using the quasiparticle vacuum to generate a bosonic coherent state. with
such a state, one may develop a microscopic theory of superuid helium, in which
the normal and superuid states become a direct analogy of noise and signal in
partially coherent radiation elds.

we now use the squeezed coherent state to formulate a possible theory that may
be useful in addressing the low energy quantum uctuations in eld theory. let us
consider again the neutral scalar eld (4 theory) as an example. one can dene
the squeezed coherent state of the eld  as [39]

|i = n expniz d3x[(x)op(x)  (x)op(x)]o

 expnz d3xd3y[op(x)d(x, y)op(y)o|0i

(74)

where n is a normalization constant. this squeezed coherent state is also dened
at a given instant time so that t = tx = ty. one can show that:

h|op(x)|i = (x) ,

h|op(x)|i = (x),

h|op(x)op(y)|i = (x)(y) + (x, y),
1(x, y)

h|op(x)op(y)|i = (x)(y) +

the squeezed coherent states of bosonic eld are also overcomplete, namely

(76)

(77)

following the similar procedure discussed in the previous section, one can derive

(79)

and (x, t) = limxy[(x, y)  0(x, y)]. here i have not integrated out the conju-
gate momentum {(x), (x)} to obtain a covariant functional integral. the physical
picture of this new formulation is that besides the original eld variable (x), (x)
in the hamiltonian formulation, quantum uctuations, characterized by (x, y) and
(x, y), are introduced as new dynamical eld variables. these new dynamical eld
variables describe the low energy excitations (.i.e. the composite particles) of
strongly interacted systems. similarly, taking the extreme value of the exponent in
(78), one can nd the equation of motion that determine the classical-like solution
0:

which is coupled with the composite eld . the equation of motion for its quantum
uctuations by  is much more complicated.

usefulness of the squeezed state functional integral is that one can derive an
eective theory for the low energy composite particle elds coupling with the orig-
inal elds. here i may propose a procedure how to develop such an eective the-
ory. first, one can determine the classical ground state by minimizing the ef-
fective hamiltonian with respect to variables ,  as well as , , which results
in 0, (0 = 0) and 0, (0 = 0). then, expanding the eective lagrangian near
(0, 0, 0, 0) up to the second-order, namely only keeping the quadratic terms in
(, , , ). quantum eects become the time dependent uctuations about
the classical ground states. the corresponding linearized equations of motion de-
termine the dispersions of quasiparticles and composite particles, denoted by k
and k, respectively. for strong interaction eld, usually k > k (due to the
spontaneously symmetry breaking). thus, in the low energy scale (k >   k),
the composite particles and the quasiparticles are decoupled. only the composite
particles are kept with the high order corrections (as a perturbation) to form the
low energy eective lagrangian. in the intermediate energy scale (  k), both
the composite particles and quasiparticles become active and coupled each other.
the eective theory is then determined by the lagrangian of the composite parti-
cles coupled with quasiparticle degrees of freedom. in a rather high energy scale
( >> k),  and  should spread averagely over the entire space-time space such
that only the original eld variables remain. thus, the theory returns back to the
original one in high energy region.

the above procedure is dierent from the conventional procedure of constructing
a low energy eective theory. in the conventional approach, the low energy eective
theory is constructed by separating the eld variables into the low energy and high

17

energy parts. then, using the functional integral discussed in the previous section
to integrate out the high energy part. the resulting lagrangian is an eective
lagrangian for the low energy physics. the advantage of the conventional approach
is that one can use the powerful renormalization group analysis of wilson [40]
to extract universal scaling properties contained in the theory, without explicitly
solving the theory itself. however, in reality, physical degrees of freedoms must
also be very dierent in dierent energy scales. a typical example is the strong
interaction in which the degrees of freedom are quarks and gluons in high energy
region. but in low energy region, the degrees of freedom become hadrons which
are composite particles of quarks and gluons. thus, in the conventional approach,
the eective theory cannot catch the right physical degrees of freedom. therefore,
beyond the critical phenomena, the conventional approach may have its limitation
in applications. the squeezed coherent state formulation of the functional integral
may provide a new method for the developments of eective eld theory, although
at this point a lot of work remains for further investigations.

a potential application of the squeezed coherent states in eld theory is the
yang-mills gauge theory, especially the color su(3) gauge theory in quantum chro-
modynamics. of course, the situation in quantum chromodynamics is much more
complicated. because of the nonlinear properties in non-abelian gauge theory, the
conventional functional integral is already quite complicated. however, the conven-
tional functional integral in non-abelian gauge theory is only useful for the derivation
of covariant feynman rules and the analysis of renormaliability. in other words, it is
only useful for perturbation calculations. as it is well-known, the diculty of qcd
lies in its nonperturbation domain, where quantum uctuation must be strong.
furthermore, the eld strength of non-abelian gauge contains the single as well as
double gauge boson emissions and absorptions:

f a
 = aa

ac
.

  aa

  gf abcab

(81)

the squeezed coherent states may be the natural quantum states describing non-
abelian gauge elds. if one can complete and extend the above formulation to the
non-abelian gauge theory, then it may be able to develop a low energy eective
theory for non-abelian gauge elds. i believe that such a low energy eective theory
should be capable in dealing with gluon condensation, gluball states as well as low
energy gluon dynamics.

6 spin coherent states and non-linear sigma
model

so far, i have only discussed bosonic-type coherent states in eld theory. however,
coherent states, in terms of the language of group theory, are embedded in a topo-
logically nontrivial geometrical space which involve a deep implication in physics
[13]. the simplest coherent state carried a topologically nontrivial geometrical space
is the spin coherent state. the most attractive property in spin coherent states is
that its topological structure naturally induces diracs magnetic monopole [41].

18

meanwhile, the spin coherent state representation of the path integral for a multi-
spin system gives a realistic realization of non-linear sigma model which is an
important eld theory model in condensed matter physics and particle physics.
thus, before i go to discuss the general physics implication containing in the ge-
ometrical structure of coherent states, it may be useful to illustrate rst the spin
coherent state in details.

let us start with a simple example: a spin-1/2 particle in a varying magnetic

eld: b(t) = (bx(t), by(t), bz(t)), described by the hamiltonian,

h(t) = s  b(t).

(82)

here  is the particles magnetic moment, ~s = (sx, sy, sz) the spin operator that
satises the usual angular momentum commutation relationship. the evolution of
system governed by (82) can be determined by the schrodinger equation, whose
general solution can be written as

|(t)i = (t)| i + (t)| i.

(83)

substituting (83) into schrodinger equation, it is easy to determine the time de-
pendence of the parameters (t) and (t). however, in order to derive the spin
coherent state, here, i may only concentrate on the structure of the state (83). the
normalization of (83) results in a constraint on the parameters (t) and (t):

if i parameterize  = sin 

2ei, eq. (83) can be expressed as

|(t)|2 + |(t)|2 = 1.

(84)

(t)

(t)

|(t)i = (cid:16) cos

ei(t)s+(cid:17)| iei(t),
the raising and lowing spin operators s are dened by s = sx  isy, and s+| 
i = | i , s| i = | i. furthermore, one can easily show that

eiso| i  |i.

then, (85) can be simply expressed as

|(t)i = |(t)(t)iei(t) .

(86)

(87)

the state |i is a standard expression of the spin coherent states.
as i mentioned a very important property of the spin coherent state is that |i
is embedded in a topologically nontrivial geometrical space, i.e., a two-dimensional
sphere s2. this can be varied directly from (85). since si = i/2 where i is pauli
matrix,

ds()  expns+  so = exp"

|| sin ||



|| sin||
cos|| # = " x0

and x0 is real while x = x1 + ix2. also, ds() is a unitary operator which leads to

0 + |x|2 = x2
x2

0 + x2

1 + x2

2 = 1.

(89)

in other words, the parameter space of ds() is a two-sphere s2 with  = 
2 ei.
therefore, the spin coherent states are ono-to-one corresponding to the points on
s2 except for the north pole where it is ambiguous since all values of  correspond
to the same point.

however, in dening the above spin coherent states, there is an ambiguous. for

example, one can also dene the spin coherent states as

|i = (cid:16) cos


2

ei + sin


2

s+(cid:17)| i,

(90)

which are also ono-to-one corresponding to the points in s2 but except for the south
pole. these two spin coherent states are related simply by a phase factor,

|i = ei|i.

(91)

geometrically, these two coherent states dene the two patches of s2. since these
two states are only dierent by a phase factor, quantum mechanically, they must be
equivalent. this implies that there is a gauge degree of freedom in the spin coherent
states.

to see clearly the physical implication induced by the topological structure of
spin coherent states, one can construct the path integral of a quantum spin system.
the spin coherent state also obeys the overcompleteness:

z d()|ih| = i,

(92)

where d() = sin dd/2 is an invariant measure on s2. then, it is easy to
show that the path integral of quantum mechanics for h = h(~s) is given by

h(tf )(tf )|(t0)(t0)i = z [d()] expniz tf

is pure geometric that only depends on the trajectory over the sphere, but not on
its explicit time dependence. for a closed path, [] is actually a berry phase
of the spin history [42]. therefore, [] is a gauge invariant one-form dened on
the sphere s2:

[] = z f

0

ad = z f

0 a(n)dn,

(95)

where n = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ) is a unit vector, and a(n) is a unit vector
potential. compare with (94) and (95), one can nd that

aa =

1  cos 
2 sin 

.

20

(96)

this vector potential has one singularity at the south pole. it is this singularity
where the dirac string which carries the magnetic monopole ux enters the sphere.
hence, aa is nothing but a gauge potential of diracs magnetic monopole. similiarly,
for the spin coherent state |i, the corresponding gauge potential is

ab =

1 + cos 

2 sin 

.

(97)

aa and ab dene the two non-singular patches of the monopole section. their
dierence is a pure u(1) gauge in the overlapping equatorial region, s1,

ab
 = aa

 + d = aa

  ig1dg.

(98)

where g = ei  u(1).
the existence of the above gauge degrees of freedom can be understand clearly
by looking at the general denition of coherent states based on group theory [9, 10].
in group theory, quantum states of a spin system form a unitary representation v s
of the su(2) group, here s is an arbitrary spin. choosing a xed state, such as the
lowest-weight state |sszi = |s  si  v s, one can dene spin coherent states as

|gis = g|s  si , g  su(2).
in general, g = exp(isx) exp(isy) exp(isz) = exp( 
note that this decomposition, called the baker-campbell-hausdor formula,
unique. as a result, one can rewrite the above spin coherent states as

2eis) exp(isz).

where

|i = exp(

(100)

(101)

2eis+  

is the standard denition of spin coherent state for an arbitrary spin s [43]. spin
s = 1/2 discussed above is a special case. as one can see, apart from a phase factor,
the spin coherent states can be generated by a unitary spin rotational operator
acting on the xed state |s  si. the unitary operator exp( 
2eis) is
the coset representation of the space su(2)/u(1)  s2. therefore the sphere s2
determines the topological structure of spin coherent states. the magnetic monopole
potential aa denes a u(1) bre bundle over this sphere s2. meanwhile, the spin
coherent states contain an arbitrary phase . in quantum mechanics, a quantum
state is specied up to a phase factor, namely, physics is invariant for dierent
choices of such a phase factor so that this phase factor is usually ignored. however,
when quantum states are embedded in a topologically nontrivial space, this phase
freedom is indeed the associated gauge degrees of freedom of the bre bundle over
the space. in spin coherent states, the phase  is just the gauge degree of freedom
that connects dierent choices of magnetic monopole potentials. ignoring (or xing)
this phase factor corresponds to a gauge xing.

21

furthermore, the topological properties of the spin coherent states also play an
important role in the study of spin dynamics. a typical example is the heisenberg
model in condensed matter physics. heisenberg model is used to understand quan-
tum magnetism of strongly correlated electron systems. the model hamiltonian
considered here is very simple:

hj = j xhi,ji

si  sj

(102)

which describes a many-spin (each spin = s) system with the nearest neighbor
exchange interaction. classically, the ground state of the above hamiltonian is
easily determined. when j > 0, the minimum energy is given by the state in which
the nearest-neighbor spins are always anti-alignment. these states are called in
literatures the neel states. correspondingly, the system is an antiferromagnet. if
j < 0, the ground state is simply given by the state with all spin aligned in the
same direction, which is a ferromagnetic state. these consequences can be obtained
explicitly by taking the spin coherent state

|{ii}i = yi

expni

2

eiis+

i 

i

i o|s  si

(103)

as a trial wave function and minimizing the model hamiltonian

(h{ii}|hj|{ii}i) = (js2 xhi,ji

[cos i cos j + sin i sin j cos(i  j)]) = 0.

(104)

the resulting ground state is given by

j > 0  i+1 =   i, i+1 = i +   antiferromagnet
j < 0  i+1 = i, i+1 = i  ferromagnet

.

(105)




an important concept one can obtain from the above result is that the ground
state spontaneously breaks the global spin rotational symmetry. as one can check
the model hamiltonian is invariant under global spin rotational transformations:

t = exp(i~  s), where s = pi si. while the ground state energy does not change

when all the spins in (105) are globally rotated. this leads to a so(3) degeneracy
of the ground states, namely these ground states have a lower symmetry than the
hamiltonian. such a situation is called the spontaneously symmetry breaking.
quantum mechanically, it leads to gapless spin-wave excitations in the heisenberg
model, and goldstone bosons in general.

the quantum dynamics of interacting spins can be studied from the time-evolution
of the system at zero-temperature. the time-evolution is determined by the greens
function which is dened by the matrix element of the evolution operator between
two spin coherent states:

g(tf , t0) = z yi

[d(ii)] expnis[i(t), i(t)]o,

here, the eective action is given by

note that the thermal dynamics can be obtained in a similar form. the partition

where  is an imaginary time from 0 to  = 1/kt .

eq. (107) shows that spin dynamics is induced by the geometrical phase  =

r dtpi s(1  cos i) i which contains the time derivative and therefore leads to the
equation of motion for {i(t), i(t)}.
it also shows that the magnetic monopole
potential ai is actually the conjugate momentum of i in spin dynamics. if one
denes the generalized position and momentum coordinates by

qi = i , pi = s(1  cos i),

(110)

and expands the eective action s[i(t), i(t)] around the ground state {q0

(111)

up to the quadratic terms, one can determine explicitly the disperson of spin-wave
excitations [44, 45].

however, since pi is related to the magnetic monopole potential, the conjugate
coordinates {qi, pi} used above are indeed gauge dependent quantities. to explore
the possible topological eects in spin dynamics, it is better to use a gauge invariant
formulation. this may be done by using a global notation n (a unit vector) to
represent the spin direction, without specifying the parameterization of the sphere
by , . then, the greens function can be expressed as:

taking the continuum limit

where ci = 1 (eixi~) for the ferromagnet (antiferromagnt), |n(xi)| = 1, and ~ =

ni  cin(xi),

g(tf , t0) = z [d(n(x)] expniz dd+1l(n)o,

(114)

where l(n) is an eective lagrangian. in the low energy (long wave-length) limit, it
is reduced to the lagrangian of the non-linear sigma model in d+1-dimensional
space [46],

l(n) =

1
2g

n  n +   

(115)

where    dnotes the high order derivatives. this lagrangian ensures the existence
of gapless spin-wave excitations. such a non-linear sigma model has been widely
studied in condensed matter physics, including the problems in quantum magnetism,
quantum hall eect and disorder dynamics.

7 generalized coherent states and nonabelian
gauge fields

in this last section, i will discuss the generalized coherent states and their potential
applications in eld theory. generalization of coherent states is based on group
theory developed by perelomov and also gilmore [9, 10]. the spin coherent state
discussed in the previous section is an example of such generalization. actually,
glauber had pointed out in his seminal paper [7] that the photon coherent states
can be constructed starting from any one of three mathematical denitions.

 denition 1. the coherent states |zi are eigenstates of the annihilation oper-
(116)

ator a:

a|zi = z|zi.

 denition 2. the coherent states |zi are quantum states with a minimum

uncertainty relationship:

x2p2 =

h2
4

(117)

 denition 3. the coherent states |zi can be obtained by applying a displace-

ment operator d(z) on the ground state of harmonic oscillator:

|zi = d(z)|0i , d(z) = exp(za  za).

(118)

we have analyzed these denitions and pointed out [zha90] that the generalization
of eigenstates of the lowering operator is not always possible. indeed, the adoption
of this denition to generalize the coherent state concept has two major drawbacks:
a). coherent states cannot be dened in hilbert spaces of nite dimensionality

24

in this way, as we have seen for the spin systems. b). the states so dened do
not correspond to physically realizable states, except under special circumstances
that the commutator of the annihilation operator (or lowering step operator) and
its hermitian adjoint is a multiple of the identity operator. therefore, under this
condition one restricts oneself to the bosonic eld. as a result, the generalization
based on denition 1 to other dynamical systems is not always applicable.

on the other hand, the generalization based on the denition 2 is by no means
unique. the bosonic (photon) coherent states are the minimum uncertainty states
essentially because they are non-spreading wave packets. although the minimum
uncertainty states are physically very interesting, the generalization along this di-
rection has several limitations: a). these coherent states can only be constructed
for the classically integrable systems in which there exists a set of canonical co-
ordinates and momenta such that the respective hamiltonians can be reduced to
quadrature. this condition requires a atness condition on the operator algebra
which reduce the commutation relations to those of the standard bosonic creation
and annihilation operators. b). the wave packets with the minimum uncertainty
are not unique. dierent ones may have dierent properties. also, such states may
be incomplete, or even if they are complete it is not certain that the standard form
of a resolution of unity exists. thus, minimum uncertainty states appear to have
few, if any, useful properties.

in literatures, the realization of generalized coherent states are indeed achieved
based on displacement operators. the basic theme of this development was to in-
timately connect coherent states with dynamical symmetry groups of a physical
problem. since all physical problems formulated in quantum theory have a dy-
namical group (although sometimes the group may be too large to be useful), an
important outcome of this recognition is that coherent states can be generalized to
all the quantum problems.

i should outline here a generalization procedure how an arbitrary coherent state
can be generated by displacement operators. consider a set of operators {ti} closed
under commutation:

[ti , tj] = titj  tjti = xk

c k

ijtk,

(119)

that is, {ti} span a algebra g, and cij in (119) are structure constants of g. if
g is a semisimple lie algebra, it is more convenient to write {ti} in terms of the
standard cartan basis {hi, e, e

 = e}:

[hi , hj] = 0 ,
[e, e] = ihi

[hi , e] = ie,
,

[e , e] = ne+.

(120)

in quantum theory, for such a given set of closed operators {ti}, the quantum
states are described by a hilbert space v  which is a representation of g. let
g be the covering group of g. the hilbert space v  carries a unitary irreducible
representation  of g. one may choose a normalized state |0i in the hilbert space
v  as a xed state. then the generalized coherent state is generated by an element

25

g  g acting on the xed state |0i.

|gig = g|0i.

(121)

in group theory, every element g  g can be uniquely decomposited into a product
of two group elements: g = kh, here one should require h  h such that

h|0i = |0iei,

(122)

and h is the maximum subgroup of g that leaves the xed state invariant up to a
phase factor. while k is an operator of the coset space g/h. if g is a semisimple
lie group and |0i is the lowest weight state, k can be generally written as

k  dg() = expnx>0

(e  e)o  g/h.

(123)

this operator dg() is usually called a displacement operator of g, which gives a
coset representation of g/h. as a result,

|gig = dg()|0iei = |(z)iei,

(124)

perelomov and gilmore [9, 10] dene the state |(z)i as the generalized coherent
states of g:
(125)

|(z)i = dg()|0i = n (z) expnx>0

zeo|0i,

and n (z) is a normalized constant. the generalized coherent states dened in such
a way have two important properties

 the set of the generalized coherent states satises:
z d(z)|(z)ih(z)| = i,

where d(z) is the g-invariant haar measure on g/h.

(126)

 the generalized coherent states are one-to-one corresponding to the points in
the coset space g/h except for some singular points, such as the north pole or
south pole of the two-sphere in spin coherent states. therefore, the generalized
coherent states are embedded into a topologically nontrivial geometrical space.

systems discussed in the previous sections are only some simple examples of the
generalized coherent states. the harmonic oscillator admits a dynamical group h4,
called heisenberg-weyl group. the photon coherent states are obtained via a one-to-
one correspondence with the geometrical coset space h(4)/u(1)u(1) (a complex
plane) by the displacement operator d(z)  h(4)/u(1)u(1). the two-photon
processes has a su(1,1) dynamical group. the squeezed states are obtained by the
displacement (squeezed) operator dsq()  su(1,1)/u(1) (a two-dimensional hy-
perboloid space). and the spin coherent states discussed in the previous section are
generated by the displacement operator ds()  su(2)/u(1) (a two-dimensional
sphere).

26

i should emphasize here that the phase  in the group-theoretical coherent state
(124) is the h-gauge degrees of freedom over the coset space g/h. all the three
sets of coherent states discussed in the previous sections contain an u(1) gauge, but
only the sphere (spin) carries a nontrivial bre bundle so that the gauge degrees of
freedom become important. to obtain a non-abelian gauge, one must consider the
generalized coherent states of a group g whose rank is larger than one such that h
can be a non-abelian group.

to examine non-abelian gauge degrees of freedom in the generalized coherent
states, one may extend the path integral to the generalized coherent state represen-
tation. the greens function is now dened as the matrix element of the evolution
operator in the generalized coherent states:

g(tf , t0) = h(z)|t expn  iz tf

t0

h(t)dto|(z)i.

(127)

following the same procedure as it has been done in the previous sections that
divides the time interval tf  t0 into n intervals, each with  = (tf  t0)/n, then
inserts the resolution of identity (126) at each interval point, and nally lets n go
to innity, the greens function can be expressed as a generalized coherent state
path integral.

g(tf , t0) = lim

yi=1hi(z)| expn  ih(ti)o|i1(z)i

(129)

s[z(t)] = z tf

t0

dtnh(z(t))|i

d

dt|(z(t))i  h(z(t))|h(t)|(z(t))io

is an eective action in the generalized coherent state representation. this path
integral is dened over the coset space g/h. the eective action contains two
terms. the second term is the matrix element of hamiltonian operator in the
coherent states, which determines the static properties of the classical hamiltonian.
the rst term is pure geometric, and it is indeed a berry phase [47, 48] that describes
quantum uctuations, and also determines the time-evolution of the system,

[g/h] = zg/hh(z)|d|(z)i = zg/h a  d ,

(130)

where a is a gauge vector potential dened over the coset space g/h, and  is a
unit vector in g/h. one can then dene the gauge connection,

f  hd(z)|d(z)i) = x

dz  dz

and  is the berry curvatures:

 = d(z)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(131)

(132)

when the rank of g is larger than one, the associated gauge potential a is non-
abelian with gauge group  h. from the above generalized coherent state path
integral, one can study the so-called geometric quantization [50, 51] and classical
gauge equations of motion in quantum mechanics [52, 53].

this path integral formulation and the associated gauge potentials have potential
applications in condensed matter physics and particle physics. this is because
classical semisimple lie groups can be generated by bilinear operators of bosonic
and fermionic creation and annihilation operators. the bilinear operators describe
the basic collective excitations in strongly correlated or strongly coupled systems.
therefore, the above formalism can be applied directly to various realistic physical
problems.

specically, the su(n) group can be generated by the particle-hole pairs: {a

1  i, j  n}, and the corresponding generalized coherent state is given by

i aj;

|{zij}i = n (z) expnxij

zija

i ajo|mi.

(133)

where a
i , ai can be either bosonic or fermionic creation and annihilation operators,
and |mi contains m particles in the lowest states, m < n. for bosonic system, the
coherent states are dened on the coset pace {zij}  su(n)/su(n-1)u(1). for
fermionic space, the coset space {zij} is su(n)/su(n-m)u(m). the spin coherent
state of the heisenberg model discussed in the last section is a special case where
the spin operators take the form:

~si =

1

2 x

a
i~ai,

(134)

 is the pauli matrix, and ,  denote the spin index of electrons. let zii =
tan 
2 ei, the spin coherent state (103) can be reduced to the form of (133) with
zij = 0 for i 6= j and n (z) = 1/(1 + |zii|2)s. correspondingly, the geometrical
space su(n)/su(n-m)u(m) is reduced to {zii}  qi sui(2)/ui(1).
the sp(2n+1) group can be realized by bosonic particle-particle and particle-hole
pairs: {a
2 ij}. the generalized coherent state of sp(2n+1) is
given by

i aj  1

j, aiaj, a

i , ai, a

i a

|{zi, zij}i = n (z) expnxi

(zia

i  z

i ai)o expnxij

1
2

zija

jo|0i.
i a

(135)

the corresponding coset space {zi, zij} is sp(2n+1)/u(n). the squeezed coherent
states discussed in sec. v are only special cases of the above coherent state.
the so(2n) group can be generated by fermionic particle-particle and particle-
2ij}. similarly, one can write down the most general

i c
hole pairs {c
coherent state for so(2n):

i cj  1

j, cicj, c

|{zij}i = n (z) expnxij

zijc

jo|0i,
i c

(136)

28

and its geometrical space is the coset space {zij}  so(2n)/u(n). a typical example
of the above coherent states is the bcs superconducting state in which only special
fermionic pairs, i.e., cooper pairs c

k, are considered [54]:

kc

1

(137)

|bcsi =

expnxk

hkc

ko|0i.
kc

kc

kck+c

k, ckck, c

q1 + |hk|2
since {c
kck1} span a su(2) algebra, the geometrical space
of the above bcs states is indeed the same as the spin coherent state in heisenberg
model, i.e., {hk}  qk suk(2)/uk(1). therefore, the bcs state carries a u(1)

gauge degree of freedom. but physically, the superconductivity is very dierent
from the ferro and antiferro-magnetism. this is because the heisenberg model has
a global spin rotational symmetry, while the bcs hamiltonian only has a global u(1)
symmetry. in the heisenberg model, the spontaneously breaking of spin rotational
symmetry leads to the spin-wave excitations which can be described by the non-
lonear sigma model derived from the spin coherent state path integral, as we have
discussed in the previous section. in the bcs theory, the spontaneously breaking
of the u(1) symmetry for the pairing coherence gives pair excitations which can be
described by ginzberg-landau theory. the ginzberg-landau theory should also be
derivable from the path integral of bcs coherent states.

the above general fermionic pairing coherent states can also be applies to systems
other than the conventional bcs superconductivity. for example, if i take the triplet
pairs:

~t +(k) =

1

2 x

c
k(i~2)c

k , ~t (k) =

1

2 x

ck(i2~)ck

(138)

together with the charge and spin operators:

q(k) =

1

2 x

(c

kck+c

kcp)1 , ~s(p) =

1

2 x

(c

k~ck +c

k~ck), (139)

which generates a so(5) group, i can construct a generalized coherent state for the
triplet pairing for superuid 3he:

|sfi = n (z) expx{ ~zk  ~t (k)o|0i.

(140)

its coset space is { ~zk}  qk sok(5)/uk(2). this so(5) coherent state carries

a non-abelian su(2) gauge. one can use this so(5) generalized coherent state to
study non-abelian gauge elds and low energy eective theory for superuid 3he
atoms [55]. recently, i also constructed a generalized pairing state to include the
singlet and triplet pairs,

|zwi = n (z)y

k+qo|0i,

(141)

29

for the study of high tc superconductivity and the close proximity between the mott
insulating antiferromagnetic order and d-wave superconducting order in cuprates[57].

here the coset space is qk sok(8)/uk(4). under the constraint of non-double oc-
cupied sites, possible gauge group contains in the above coherent pairing states may
be su(2)u(1) or a larger one up to u(4). this may open a new window for the
study of the dynamical mechanism of high tc superconductivity.
if one takes the continuum limit in the coordinate space and lets t0  ,
tf  , then the path integral based on the generalized coherent states can be
expressed as

g = z [d( (x))] expniz dd+1xna(x)  (x)  h[ (x)]o,

(142)

where x is a coordinate in the d+1 dimensional minkowshi space. if the hamiltonian
has a symmetry s  g, and the static classical ground states (which can be obtained
by minimizing h with respect to the coherent state parameters) spontaneously
breaks this symmetry, then one can use the saddle-point expansion to derive a
general non-linear sigma model dened on g/h,

g = z [d( (x))] expniz dd+1xn 1

2g



(x)   (x) +    + topo,

(143)

to describe the low energy physics in the long-wave length limit, where {  } denotes
the higher order derivatives in the non-linear sigma model, and top is a topo-
logical phase, corresponding to a wess-zumino-witten topological term [58, 59, 60]
that is induced by the gauge degrees of freedom contained in the generalized co-
herent states and/or a chern-simons term of topological gauge elds over the coset
space g/h [61]. there may exist many potential applications of such a non-linear
sigma model in real physical problems, such as quantum hall eect [60, 62], the
high tc superconductivity [63, 64], the disorder systems [65] in condensed matter
physics.
it is also possible to apply such theory to quantum chromodynamics in
particle physics when quantum chromodynamics is formulated in lattices[66, 67]),
and quantum gravity [68], etc.

8 summation

in summation, as i have emphasized throughout the article, coherent states pos-
sess three unique properties that are fundamental to eld theory. the property
of coherent behavior uniquely describes the processes involving innite number of
virtual particles. the coherent excitations obtained from coherent states also give
the essential physical picture of long-range orders induced by strong correlations.
the property of overcompleteness provides a reformulation and generalization of
the functional integral in eld theory, in which quantum uctuations of compos-
ite operators are included as new low energy dynamical eld variables. one may
thereby be able to determine the dynamical degrees of freedom in dierent energy
scales and to derive the corresponding eective theory. the property of topolog-
ically nontrivial geometrical structure in generalized coherent states allows one to

30

explore the origin of gauge elds and associated gauge degrees of freedom. in this
article, i have not touched the recently development of coherent states in terms of
superalgebras and quantum groups. these topics may also be very important in
the modern development of eld theory, such as in supersymmetry, superstring and
conformal eld theory. nevertheless, in my personal opinions, understanding the
origin as well as the nature of gauge degrees of freedom in physics is perhaps the
most fundamental problem in eld theory.
