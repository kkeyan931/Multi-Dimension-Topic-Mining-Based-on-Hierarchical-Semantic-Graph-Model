abstract

it is argued that quantum traveling of d-particles presents the joining-splitting
processes of eld theory feynman graphs. the amplitudes in d dimensions can be
corresponded with those of a d + 2 dimensional theory in the light-cone frame. it
is shown that this light-cone formulation enables to study processes with arbitrary
longitudinal momentum transfers. it is discussed that a massless sector exists which
can be taken as the low energy limit. by taking the constant relative distance in the
bound-states we nd a spectrum for the intermediatory elds.

1 introduction

perturbative string theory is dened by series expansions based on the topologies of the
string world-sheet, with the weights proportional to the action of string. the pertur-
bation series can be presented as sum over dierent graphs which describe the joining-
splitting(js) processes of strings as events in space-time. in fact these graphs are those
which should be obtained as feynman graphs of a string eld theory. in spite of the absence
of a complete string eld theory, those graphs which are produced by small strings (  0
limit) correspond to well known particle eld theories namely various (super) gravity and
gauge theories. so basically one expects to have a similar interpretation for js processes of
particles and corresponding particle eld theory graphs.

on the other hand, through the developments of understanding of m-theory as a
m(atrix) model [1], a description of perturbative light-cone string theory was achieved,
based on a non-abelian gauge theory living on a 2d cylinder which in most times can be
interpreted as the world-sheet of free strings. this description was mentioned in [2, 3], more

concreted in [4], and has been checked to produce the well known amplitudes in string the-
ory [5, 6]. besides in [7] (see also [8]) it was argued that congurations with dierent lengths
of strings and their js processes are corresponded to various backgrounds of world-sheet
(gauge) elds. by the above picture for feynman graphs of strings, it is the purpose of
this letter to study similar ones for d-particles. it is argued that quantum traveling of d-
particles are corresponded to graphs of a certain particle eld theory and their amplitudes
in the light-cone frame. so it provides the possibility of dening a particle eld theory by
its feynman graphs, those generated by js processes of d-particles.

it is useful to compare our approach to d-particle dynamics and that of m(atrix) model
calculations [1]. in the case of m(atrix) model, because of large amount of supersymmetry,
the d-particle action is trusted even for large separated d-particles; where it is not expected
the action to be valid [9]. though it may be taken an advantage, but lacks using the action
in non-supersymmetric case. in our approach the dynamics of d-particles is used exactly in
the region of kinematical variables where the action is dened. it causes that the calculation
of d-particle scattering amplitudes can be performed even in the non-supersymmetric case.
the gauge theoretic description of interactions in bosonic case is supported by the result
of [5] for light-cone bosonic strings.

the organization of the article is as follows. in the next section we review some impor-
tant aspects of d-particle dynamics. in section 3 the correspondence between d-particle
quantum mechanics and the light-cone eld theory amplitudes is presented. section 4 is
devoted to specication of the eld theory in more details by estimating the masses of the
intermediate states. section 5 is for conclusion.

2 on d-particles

dp-branes are p dimensional objects which are dened as (hyper)surfaces which can trap
the ends of strings [10]. one of the most interesting aspects of d-brane dynamics appears in
their coincident limit. in the case of coinciding n dp-branes, their dynamics are captured
by dimensional reduction of u(n) gauge theory to p + 1 dimensions of dp-brane world-
volume [11, 10].

for d-particles (p = 0) since only time exists in the world-line the above dynamics

reduces to quantum mechanics of matrices. the bosonic action is [1, 12, 13]

s = m0z dttr (cid:18)1

2 and m0 = (gs)1 are the string tension and the mass of d-particles respec-
where
tively, and gs is string coupling. here dt = t  ia0 acts as covariant derivative in the 0+1
dimensional gauge theory. for n d-particles xs are in adjoint representation of u(n)
and have the usual expansion xi = xiata, a = 1, ..., n 2, where tas make basis of u(n)
algebra.

2

in fact this action is the result of the string theory calculation of d-brane interactions

in the so-called gauge theory limit, dened by:

gs  0,
ls  0,
v
l2
s
r
l2
s

= xed,

= xed,

(2.2)

where v and r are the relative velocities and distances involved in the kinematics of d-branes
and ls =  is the string length.

firstly let us search for d-particles in the above lagrangian:

for each direction i there are n 2 variables instead of n which one expects for n particles.
however there is a solution for the equations of motion which restricts the t(a) basis to
the n dimensional cartan subalgebra. this solution causes vanishing the potential and
one nds the equations of motion for n free particles. in this case the u(n) symmetry is
broken to u(1)n and the interpretation of n remaining variables as the classical relative
positions of n particles is meaningful. the center of mass of d-particles is represented by
the trace of the x matrices and easily can be seen that the momentum of the center of
mass is conserved.

in the case of unbroken gauge symmetry the gauge transformations mix the entries of
matrices and the interpretation of positions for d-particles remains obscure [14]. but even
in this case the center of mass is meaningful and the ambiguity about positions only comes
back to the relative positions of d-particles. in unbroken phase the n 2  n non-cartan
elements of matrices have a stringy interpretation; they govern the dynamics of low lying
oscillations of strings stretched between d-particles.

let us study the limit   0 more carefully. here this limit is analogous to the limit

gs  0 in [4]. in this limit to have a nite energy one has to restrict xs to

[xi, xj] = 0,  i, j,

(2.3)

and consequently vanishing the potential term in the action. so the classical action reduces
to the action of n free particles

s = z dt

(2.4)

however the above observation fails when d-particles arrive each other. when two d-
particles come very near each other two eigenvalues of xi matrices will be equal and the
corresponding o-diagonal elements can get non-zero values. this is the same story of gauge
symmetry enhancement. the uctuations of these o-diagonal elements are responsible for
the interaction in d-particle bound-states.

3

in the non-coincident case we take simply the action (2.4). it is based on our expectation
for free d-branes in large seperations [10]. for n coincident d-particles one may write the
action and hamiltonian as,

s = z dt(cid:18)1

(nm0) x 2 + lint(xa, xa)(cid:19), a = 1, 2, ..., n 2  1,

h =

2(nm0)

+ hint(xa, pa),

(2.5)

(2.6)

in which x and p are the position and momentum of the center of mass and xas and pas
are the non-abelian positions and momenta.

the dependences of energy eigenvalues and the size of bound states are notable. by the

scalings [12, 9]

t  g1/3

one nds the relevant energy and size scales as

ld+2 = g1/3

s /ls,

(2.7)

(2.8)

the length scale ld+2 should be the fundamental length scale of the covariant d + 2 dimen-
sional theory whose light-cone formulation is argued to be action (2.5) . in the weak
coupling gs  0 one nds ld+2  ls which allows to treat the bound-states of nite number
of d-particles as point like objects in the transverse dimensions of the light-cone frame.
also consequently one nds m0  e  l2
d+2 which shows invariance under boost transfor-
mation of this combination. as we will see the mass of the intermediate states appear as
 m0  e.

3 d-particle feynman graphs

due to momentum conservation, n-particle states in light-cone frame have np+ longitu-
dinal momentum. on the other hand, the longitudinal momentum of a state plays the role
of the newtonian mass in the transverse space of light-cone frame. so to have n-particle
(normalizable) states the existence of marginal bound-states is necessary; those which are
dened by ebinding = 0. so the energy-mass equivalence relation for them is read as

in the case d = 9 this length is known to be the 11-dimensional planck length.

e = mn = n  m0

(3.1)

figure 1: s-channel tree path for d-particles, n = n1 + n2 = n3 + n4.

which in light-cone case we have m0 = p+. the existence of normalizable marginal bound-
states in d-particle case is claried for supersymmetric case [16] , and also for bosonic case
[17].

here there are two possibilities to produce specied initial and nal states, the so-called

s- and t-channel processes.

s-channel
take the probability amplitude corresponded to detect four clusters of d-particles, those
with masses n1m0 and n2m0 in positions x1 and x2 at time ti, and masses n3m0 and n4m0
in x3 and x4 at time tf , presented by path integral as

hx3, x4; tf|x1, x2; tii = z es,

and supplied by the newtonian mass conservation

n1 + n2 = n3 + n4 = n.

in the limit   0 one writes (fig.1) 

hx3, x4; tf|x1, x2; tii = (cid:20)z es(cid:21)0

(3.2)

(3.3)

here as in eld theory we have dropped the dis-connected graphs. this work can be done by subtracting

the contribution of paths corresponded to free moving of d-particles.

the rst relation of (3.9) learns us that each d-particle has light-cone momentum equal to
m0; this is because to have the light-cone momentum nm0 for n d-particles in the time
interval [t1, t2] (fig.1). so (3.8) is the same expression which one writes (in momentum
space) as tree diagram contribution to 4-point function of a eld theory but in the light-
cone frame [15], with exchanging masses as mns. it is noted that m 2

4 field theory of feynman graphs

the question of what eld theory? is answered only by knowing the full set of eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian hint dened by,

hint|ni = en|ni.

the knowledge about the spectrum of the interested hamiltonian is restricted. as is noted
earlier the existence of zero-energy bound-states is discussed in [16, 17] . so, as the same
of string theory, we have massless states which produce the low energy limit of the d + 2
dimensional theory.

in the following we discuss another approach, the constant background.

4.1 constant background

when two d-particles come very near each other two eigenvalues of xi matrices will become
approximately equal and this makes the possibility that the corresponding o-diagonal
elements take non-zero values.

in the coincident limit the dynamics is complicated. the relative matrix position may

be taken as:

xi =   xi

y 

yi

i xi! ,

(4.1)

where y  is the complex conjugate of y . by inserting this matrix in the lagrangian one
obtains:

4(2)2 (1  cos2 )x2

j + o(y 3)(cid:19), (4.2)
s = z dt
with x for the center of mass and  is the angle between ~x and the complex vector ~y .
as is apparent in the limit   0 which is in our direct interest, the x element can not
get large values and have a small range of variation.
in high-tension approximation of
strings, one takes the relative distance of d-particles constant and of order of bound-state
size x  g1/3

ls, as was mentioned in sec.2. so one writes:

j yiy 

i + m0 x2

s = z dt(cid:18)1

 +   (cid:19),

(4.3)

where in the above k is an  independent numerical factor, and y is the perpendicular
part of the ~y to the relative distance ~x. the parallel part of ~y behaves as a free part.
in d + 1 dimensions of space-time the dimension of y is d  1 which shows that we
are encountered with 2  (d  1) harmonic oscillators because, y is a complex variable .
in the bosonic case these states are formed by identied d-particles, with the corresponding eigen-

function to be constant in internal space [17].

this is the same number of harmonic oscillators which appear in one-loop calculations [18]

9

these harmonic oscillators are corresponded to vibrations of oriented open strings stretched
between d-particles.

by translating all the above to the momentum space and doing the integrals it is found
hp3, p4, e3, e4; tf|p1, p2, e1, e2; tii  (d)(p1 + p2  p3  p4)

5 conclusion

(4.10)

(4.11)

it is argued in this work that the quantum mechanics of d-particles in d dimensions can
be corresponded to light-cone formulation of a d + 2 dimensional eld theory. the length
scale of the d + 2 dimensional theory is g1/3
ls. also it is shown that this light-cone
formulation enables to study processes with arbitrary longitudinal momentum transfers. it
is discussed that a massless sector exists which can be taken as the low energy limit of the
d + 2 dimensional theory. by taking the constant relative distances in the bound-states we
found a spectrum for the intermediatory elds.

s

in the supersymmetric case a candidate for the d + 2 dimensional theory can be guessed
by m(atrix) theory approach to m-theory [1]. m-theory and type iia string theory both
have supergravities in their low energy limit in 11 and 10 dimensions respectively. there is a
gauge theoretic description of stringy feynman graphs [2, 3, 4]. since the 10 dimensional
(iia) supergravity is corresponded to stringy feynman graphs in the limit   0, so
one may expect to have a similar relation between d-particles feynman graphs and 11
dimensional supergravity.
