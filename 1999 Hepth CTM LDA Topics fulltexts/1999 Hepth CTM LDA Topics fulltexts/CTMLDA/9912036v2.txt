abstract

a u (1) bfyangmills theory on noncommutative r4 is presented and in this
formulation the u (1) yangmills theory on noncommutative r4 is seen as a defor-

mation of the pure bf theory. quantization using brst symmetry formalism is

discussed and feynman rules are given. computations at oneloop order have been

performed and their renormalization studied. it is shown that the u (1) bfym on
noncommutative r4 is asymptotically free and its uvbehaviour in the computation

of the function is like the usual su (n ) commutative bfym and yang mills theo-

ries.

1 introduction :

it is generally believed that our picture of the spacetime as a manifold locally viewed

as a at minkowski space should be modied drastically at the planck scale [1]. one

possibility is to consider that the space, at this scale, is a noncommutative space and

eld theories on these spaces have to be formulated in the framework of noncommu-

tative geometry [2]. constructions of the fundamental interactions along conness

approach are described in the literature [3].

moreover, it has been shown by connes, douglas and schwarz [4] that a supersym-

metric yangmills theory on noncommutative torus is naturally related to compacti-

cation of matrix theory which means that noncommutative geometry can be usefull

in string theory [5].

yet, the most urgent problem waiting to be solved, is whether or not quantum eld

theory on noncommutative space is welldened.

specically, it has been established in the case of noncommutative spacetime, that

two dimensional theories on the fuzzy sphere [6] and on the quantum cylinder possess
no uvdivergences at all. in contrast, eld theories on noncommutative r4 [7], non-

commutative 3tori [8] and quantum plane have uvdivergences [9]. thus, ultraviolet

behaviour of a eld theory on noncommutative space is sensitive to the topology.
recently, oneloop renormalizability of yangmills on noncommutative r4 [10] and

on noncommutative torus [11] has been demonstrated. particularly, it has also been

shown that these elds theories have an asymptotical free behaviour. a general

discussion about renormalizability of a massive scalar quantum eld theoy on non-

commutative rd has been carried out in [12] and unfamiliar mixing eects of ir and

uv due to noncommutativity has been found in [13]. such a mixing has no analog

in conventional quantum eld theory.

here, we will be concerned with the perturbative quantization of the socalled bf
yangmills theory ( bfym ) on noncommtative r4.
we recall that bfym formulation on commutative r4 has been used in [14] to in-

troduce an explicit representation of the t hooft algebra, making closer connection

2

between yangmills theory and topological eld theories of bf type [15].
the euclidean bfym on commutative r4 is described by the action :

scom

bf y m = z t r(cid:0)ib  f + g2 b  b(cid:1)

= z d4x(cid:18) i

2

ba

 f a

 + g2 ba

 ba (cid:19) .

(1)

where f = f a

 dx  dx t a is the usual eld strength, b is a lie valued 2form and
 is the hodge product for a pfrom with t a as generators of su (n ) lie algebra in
the fundamental representation normalized as t r(t at b) = 1

2 ab.

in this framework yangmills theory is seen in the rst order formalism as a defor-

mation of a topological theory of bf type. a proof of the full equivalence of bfym

with the standard second order formalism has been achieved through path integral

and algebraic methods [16].

its uvbehaviour and computation of the function have been carried out showing

that it is equal to the yangmills case [17].

the paper is organized as follows.
in section 2 we introduce the u (1) bfym on
noncommutative r4 and study its quantization with the brst formalism. in section

3 we derive the feynman rules and compute the oneloop divergent diagrams. section

4 is concerned with the oneloop renormalizability and explicit oneloop computation

of the  function. finally in section 5, we summarize our results.

2 bf yang mills on noncommutative r4 :

the noncommutative r4 is dened as the algebra a generated by x,  = 1, 2, 3, 4

satisfying the commutation relations :

[x, x ] = i  ,

[x, ] = 0.

(2)

where  is a real constant antisymmetric matrix with rank 4.

in the noncommutative geometry framework, the geometrical features of the non-

commutative manifold are described by a c algebra. the algebra of functions on
noncommutative r4 can be considered as the deformation of the c algebra of con-
tinuous complex functions over r4 vanishing at innity, using the weyl product,

(f  g)(x) = e

i
2 







 f (x + )g(x + )|==0

= z z

d4p
(2)2

d4q
(2)2 ei(p,q) ei(p+q)x f (p) g(q).

(3)

3

where (p, q) = 1

2 pq and f ( resp. g ) is the fourier transform of f ( resp. g ) .

the  product satises the following identities :

z d4x (f  g)(x) = z d4x(g  f )(x) = z d4xf (x)g(x)

z d4x (f  g  h)(x) = z d4x (h  f  g)(x) = z d4x(g  h  f )(x)

(4)

the last identity follows from the associativity of the  product , i.e (f  g)  h =

f  (g  h).

an alternative reformulation of the u (1) yangmills theory on noncommutative r4

is through the rst order formalism. this model, named gaussian u (1) bfyang
mills on noncommutative r4 is described by the action :

sbf y m = z d4x (cid:18) i

2

b  f + g2b  b(cid:19) (x).

(5)

here f = a  a + {a, a} is the eld strength for the antihermitian gauge

eld a where {a, a }(x) = (a  a) (x)  (a  a) (x) is the moyal bracket and

b is an antisymmetric tensor.

it is easy to see that this action is onshell equivalent to the classical u (1) yangmills
action on noncommutative r4. this latter can also be recovered by performing a path

integration over b . indeed, after a eld redenition b  b/g we get :

z db esbf y m  esy m .

where sy m is the yangmills action on noncommutative r4 given by :

sy m =

1

4g2 z d4x (f   f ) (x).

the bfym action is invariant under the usual gauge symmetry :

(6)

(7)

a = d ,

f = {f , } ,

b = {b , }.

(8)

with d =  + {a, }.

in the following we will use the brst formalism [19], which requires the introduction

of faddeevpopov ghost c and antighost c, auxiliary eld b and a sbrst operator

dened as :

sa = dc , sf = {f , c} , sc =  c  c , sc = b ,

sb = 0 , sb = {b , c}.

(9)

4

which is oshell nilpotent s2 = 0.

correspondingly, one introduces a gaugexing term action :

sgf = z d4x s(cid:16)c  (


2

b  a) (cid:17) (x).

and an external eld contribution :

sext = z d4x (cid:0) 

a  sa + 

b  sb + c  sc (cid:1) (x).

then the complete treelevel action is :

 [a, b , c, c, b, a, b , c] = sbf y m + sgf + sext

+b  (


2

b  a) + c  dc + 

a  dc + 

= z d4x (cid:18) i

2

b  f + g2b  b
b  {b , c}  c  (c  c) (cid:17) .

which satises the slavnovtaylor identity :

s () = 0.

where

s () = z d4x (cid:18)

(14)

3 oneloop calculations :

to check the oneloop uvbehaviour of the bfym on noncommutative r4, we derive

the feynman rules by expanding sbf y m + sgf and separating it into quadratic and

higher order pieces. after eld rescaling, b  b/g and a  ga, the quadratic pieces

give the propagators in momentum space for the elds a, b and c, and the higher

order pieces give the vertices baa and cac.

after expansion, the quadratic action is found to be :

s0 = z d4x(cid:16)i  b  a + b  b +


2

b  b  b  a + c  2c(cid:17) . (15)

while the interaction action is given by :

sint = z d4x(cid:18) ig

2

 b  {a, a} + g c  {a, c}(cid:19) .

(16)

greens functions are derived by using the generating functional z0 [ja , jb , jb, jc, jc]

with sources terms for each of the elds :

z0 [ja , jb , jb, jc, jc] = n z dadbdbdcdc es0ss.

(17)

5

where

ss = z d4x (a  ja  + b  jb  + b  jb + c  jc + c  jc) .

(18)

is the source term action.

since s0 is not diagonal in elds, and cannot be diagonalized, the resulting propaga-

tors of the elds are not diagonal either. this means that there are cross propagators

that do not vanish at tree level. to derive explicitly greens functions for various

elds, we work in momentum space and shift all the elds by eld independent func-

tions c :

a(p)  a(p) + ca (p)

b(p)  b (p) + cb  (p)

b(p)  b(p) + cb(p)

c(p)  c(p) + cc(p)

c(p)  c(p) + cc(p).

(19)

by making the linear terms in the elds vanish and solving for cs, the following

feynman rules for propagators a, b, c and c are then obtained :

, p 

 q, 

daa

 (p, q) = 1

p2 (cid:16) + (  1) pp

p2 (cid:17) (p + q)

interaction vertices arise from sint as usual. indeed, in momentum space baa and

cac vertices are :

, p

, p 

 q 

v baa

(p, q, r) =  2g  sin (p, q) (p + q + r)

r 

 q

v cac

(p, q, r) =  2ig q sin (p, q) (p + q + r) .

gure 2

the above feynman rules for u (1) bfym on noncommutative r4 are the same
as the usual euclidean bfym on commutative r4 for su (n ) lie algebra in which

group indices a are identied with the momentum pa and the structure constants fabc

with 2i sin (pb, pc) (pa + pb + pc) , ( see [20] and [10, 11] for yangmills theory
on noncommutative torus and noncommutative r4 ).

in gure 3 and 4 ( see appendix ), all relevant oneloop diagrams for selfenergies

and vertices are presented. we have explicitly calculated the oneloop diagrams of
bfym on noncommutative r4 where only planar contributions are considered. every

diagram gets then multiplied by a phase factor that depends only on the momenta

of the external lines. we point out that nonplanar contributions may create some

trouble at higher order.

these calculations are done by using dimensional regularization in d = 4  2 dimen-
sion [21, 22] where the 4dimensional measure d4k
one dd k

(2)4 is replaced by the ddimensional
((2)d and before performing the ddimensional integration, some care has to be

taken according to the rules in [22].
moreover, whenever a product of sines appears, we express each sin (p, q) as 1
ei(p,q)) and transform these sines into a rst term depending on the internal mo-

2i (ei(p,q)

mentum which provides the feynman integrals by oscillatory factors making them

nite and a second term independent of the internal momentum so that the integrals

have poles. then we extract the oneloop uv divergent contribution to all the di-

vergent 1p i green functions.

7

the obtained results for selfenergies are then given as follows :

a) aa self energy,

daa

 (p, q) = (

1
3

 )

g2

(4)2 () (cid:0)p2  pp(cid:1) (p + q).

b) ab self energy,

dab

(p, q) =

1
2

(3  )

g2
(4)2 ()  p (p + q).

c) bb self energy,

dbb

(p, q) = (1 + )

g2
(4)2 () (    ) (p + q).

d) ghosts cc self energy,

dcc(p, q) =

3
2

(1  )

g2
(4)2 () p2 (p + q).

similarly the divergent parts for the two vertices baa and cac read,

v baa

(p, q, r) = 2 

g3
(4)2 ()  sin (p, q) (p + q + r).

v cac

(p, q, r) = 4 i 

g3
(4)2 () q sin (p, q) (p + q + r).

we see from the power counting argument, that the supercial degree of divergence

s for these diagrams is given by :

s = 4  (ea + ec)  2eb.

where ea, eb and ec represent the number of a, b and ghost c external lines re-

spectively.

then we remark that the oneloop divergent contributions for selfenergies and ver-
tices are like the usual bfym theory on commutative r4 for the lie algebra su (n )

with structure constants fabc replaced by 2i sin (pb, pc) and the quadratic casimir

c2(g) equal to 2.

up on these replacements, our results agree with the usual su (n ) bfym on commu-
tative r4 [17] where their calculations have been done in the landau gauge (  = 0

).
we see also that the divergent part of the ghost vertex v cac(p, q, r) vanishes in the

8

landau gauge due to the transversality of the propagators in this gauge and the ver-
tex v baa(p, q, r) is nite.
at the oneloop level, two other trilinear and quadrilinear vertices v aaa
 (p1, p2, p3)
and v aaaa
 (p1, p2, p3, p4) respectively appear and do not belong to the treelevel
u (1) bfym action on noncommutative r4. they correspond to the nonlinear self
interactions of u (1) yangmills action on noncommutative r4 and arise from term

(f   f ) (x) which is allowed to enter at the quantum level due to the symmetries

of the theory. we will see in the next section how such a counterterm can arise.

4 renormalization and  function :

before we perform the renormalization, we consider the gauge xing action sgf and

integrate out the auxiliary elds b. after this manipulation, the sbf y m + sgf = s

becomes :

s = z d4x(cid:18) i

2

 b  f + b  b 

1
2

(a)  ( a ) + c  dc(cid:19) .(20)

to perform the renormalization, we follow standard techniques [23, 24] and substitute

the bare quantities for the renormalized ones, where in general an operational mixing

is allowed by the symmetry and parity properties of the elds. we then have for the

elds :




b0 

f0 


 = 


c0 = zc cr

zbb 

0

i
2 zba 
zaa 









br



fr




c0 = zc cr.

and the parameters g and  :

g0 = zg gr , 0 = z r.

(21)

(22)

where the constants zaa, zba and zbb and zc are the a eld, ba elds, bb elds

and ghosteld renormalization constants, respectively, while the constants zg and
2 are the coupling constant and gauge parameter renormalization con-

z = zaa

stants. here fr  = ar  ar  +zaazggr {ar , ar  } is the renormalized

eld strength.

notice that the presence of the factor i is necessary in (21) since b and f have

9

opposite parity and a mixing of br  is not allowed since f must be a curvature
tensor. with the above eld redenitions, a counterterm (f  f  ) (x), absent at

tree level in the theory, appears at the quantum level which is required to renormalize

the trilinear aaa and quadrilinear aaaa vertices arising at oneloop level.

now let us analyze the structure of the counterterms that make nite the self
energies and the vertices of the u (1) bfyangmills theory on noncommutative r4.

it is necessary rst to begin by writing the action in terms of bare quantities :

s = z d4x(cid:18) i

2

b0   f0  + b0   b0

 

1
20

(a0

)  (a0

) + c0  dc0(cid:19) .(23)

and then in terms of renormalized elds and renormalization constants :

s = z d4x (cid:18) i

2

zbb (zaa + 2zba)  br   fr  + zbb



2 br   br
2cr  dcr (cid:19) .(24)

 zba (zaa + zba) fr   fr

 

1

2r

(ar

)  ( ar

) + zc

where dcr = cr + zaazggr{ar , cr} is the renormalized covariant derivative.

apart from the constraints on the renormalization constants by the gauge ward

identities, the zs are in principle completely arbitrary.

in practice, because the

u (1) bfym theory on noncommutative r4 needs regularizing, the arbitrariness of

the zs is only in the nite parts. since feynman rules of the u (1) bfym theory on
noncommutative r4 at tree level should not be modied we expect :

zaa  1 + a(r)

zbb  1 + b(r)

2

gr
(4)2 () + (  ) + o(gr
gr
(4)2 () + (  ) + o(gr

2

gr
(4)2 () + (  ) + o(gr

2)

zc  1 + d(r)

2

gr
(4)2 () + (  ) + o(gr

2).

(25)

where (  ) represents nite terms at order gr

2. note that zba  gr

2 () in order

not to modify the feynman rules at the tree level. moreover, the zs renormaliza-

tion constants should be determined by adjusting the counterterms so as to cancel

overall divergences appearing in oneloop feynman amplitudes. in our case, they are

obtained by straightforward comparison between the feynman rules for the quadratic

(24) and the divergent parts of selfenergies.

10

consequently, the following system appears :

zbb (zaa + 2zba) = 1 +

1
2

(3  r)

zbb

2 = 1  (1  r)

2

gr
(4)2 () + (  ) + o(gr

4zba (zaa + zba) = (

2)

zc

2 = 1 +

3
2

(1  r)

2

gr
(4)2 () + (  ) + o(gr

solving (26) by a use of (25) gives :

a(r) =

(28)

our remaining task is now to determine the renormalization constant zg.

indeed

from the cac vertex we get :

zg zaa zc

gr
(4)2 ().

(29)

it is easy to extract from (29) the renormalization of the coupling constant which

turns out to be :

zg = 1 

11

2

gr
(4)2 ().

the function can now be easily read from (30) :

1 = 

11
3

.

(30)

(31)

which ensures that the theory is asymptotically free [24]. moreover, as expected, the
uvbehaviour of the u (1) bfym on noncommutative r4 is the same as the usual
su (n ) bfym and yangmills theories on commutative r4.

we also notice that the weylmoyal matrix  expressing the nonlocal caracter of

the interaction is not renormalized at the oneloop order.

11

5 conclusions :

in summary we have introduced the u (1) bfym theory on noncommutative r4 and
shown its equivalence to u (1) yangmills on noncommutative r4 after integrating

out the antisymmetric b eld.

quantization of this theory in the brst symmetry formalism is studied where the

full quantum action with the slavnovtaylor identity is obtained.

after extracting the feynman rules, oneloop calculations have been performed and

particularly the oneloop uvdivergent contribution to the divergent 1p i green

functions. its renormalization at oneloop level has been described and its asymp-

totical free behaviour checked. moreover we have shown that the uvbehaviour of

the u (1) bfym theory on noncommutative r4 is similar to the usual su (n ) bfym
and yangmills theories on commutative r4. we have also seen that  at least  at

the oneloop order no renormalization of the weylmoyal matrix  is needed.

within the oneloop level, apart from some complications in the computations due

to the nonlocal terms in the action that result in feynman integrals with oscillatory

factors, no new phenomena appear. it becomes clear that the u (1) bfym on non-
commutative r4 behaves like the commutative case.

for g = 0, the action (5) is just the u (1) bf theory on noncommutative r4 1 :

sbf = z d4x

i
2

 b  f.

(32)

as for the commutative bf, this u (1) bf on noncommutative r4 action is invariant

under the gauge symmetry :

a = d , f = {f , } , b = {b , }.

(33)

and an extra topological  symmetry :

a = 0 , f = 0 , b = d  d .

(34)

among the problems  that could be studied are the quantization and the pertur-

bative renormalization of the bf theory on noncommutative spaces. these will be

1 for commutative spaces, the bf is a topological theory of schwarz type. indeed for this theory on s 4

or r4, the partition function is just one whereas for t 4, it is proportional to vol(t ) where t  is the dual

torus. a question  that can be adressed - is the value of the partition function for dierent topologies on

noncommutative spaces. thanks to sheikhjabbari for giving rise to this point.

12

adressed elsewhere.
we should mention that the u (1) bfym on noncommutative r4 can also be inter-

preted as a deformation ( perturbation ) of the pure u (1) bf theory on noncommu-
tative r4 having besides the gauge symmetry, the topological one.

prototype of topological gauge eld theory of schwarz type is the chernsimons the-

ory. renormalization and niteness of this system on noncommutative 3d spaces can

also be carried out and will be reported in a future work.

in ref [5], seiberg and witten established a relation between noncommutative yang

mills and commutative one. indeed, they obtained a transformation from commu-
tative gauge eld a with gauge parameter  to noncommutative gauge eld a with
gauge parameter  by requiring the equivalence of the gauge transformation of a
and a. we have checked and found that this mapping exists also for bfyang mills

theory [25].
