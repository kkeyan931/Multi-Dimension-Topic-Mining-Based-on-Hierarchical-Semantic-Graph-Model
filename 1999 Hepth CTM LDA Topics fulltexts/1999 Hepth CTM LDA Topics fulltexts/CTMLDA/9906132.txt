(15)) compute probabilities expected results. completing measurement would say wave function collapsed. however, entire model taken account real collapse; measurement result strictly predetermined fact p(prk) homothety. 7 conclusions overview picture emerges analysis follow- ing. general, noncommutative regime atemporal. meaning ascribe term dynamics fact certain geometric quantities expressed terms derivations algebra dening considered noncommutative geometry. derivations counter- parts vector elds, regarded modelling certain type global change. concept dynamics improves algebra properties admitting existence one-parameter modular groups (see ). von neumann algebra, generated algebra a, becomes dynamical object (see ), modular groups describe evolution corresponding operators. follows, shall assume algebra admits existence modular groups. model means dynamics system described eq. (6). dynamics (or evolution) depends state system nds itself. especially interesting consider evolution random operators. limitation since, lemma 5.1 isomorphism algebra von neumann algebra random operators. fact important consequences. ran- dom operators, elements von neumann algebra, probabilistic objects albeit generalized sense. let us remind noncommutative counterpart probability space pair (m, ) von neu- mann algebra (faithful normal) state m. denition 17 state, positive (i. e.
