we consider the free eld approach or bosonization technique for the wess-
zumino-novikov-witten model with arbitrary kac-moody algebra on riemann sur-
face of genus zero. this subject was much studied previously, and the paper can
be partially taken as a brief survey. the way to obtain well-known schechtman-
varchenko solutions of the knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations as certain correlators
in free chiral theory is revisited. this gives rise to simple description of space of the
wznw conformal blocks. the general n-point correlators of the model are con-
structed from the conformal blocks using non-chiral action for free elds perturbed
by exactly marginal terms. the method involved generalizes the dotsenko-fateev
prescription for minimal models. as a consequence of this construction we obtain
new integral identities.

1 introduction

the wess-zumino-novikov-witten model [1, 2, 3] has a long history. its exceptional role is
determined by the fact that this model can be in broad sense thought of as a generator of all
the 2d conformal theories [4]. since the seminal work by knizhnik and zamolodchikov [5] much
eort has been made to obtain exact solution of wznw model [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. the
most progress was achieved in solving the model by means of its representation in terms of the
free elds (bosonization approach). since the work by wakimoto [13] this approach has been
developed by many groups [9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].

in fact, it is possible to think of conformal theories as just of theories of free elds with
additional constraints on the space of states. a good example of how this idea works is the
well-known dotsenko-fateev free eld representation for minimal models [19]. there exist a
lot of serious arguments in favour of applicability of such a viewpoint to the wznw model.
for instance, in geometrical quantization approach the wznw lagrangian may be naturally
considered as a d1 of a kirillov-konstant form on the orbit of kac-moody coajoint represen-
tation [14]. after choosing gauss parameterization for the group element the action becomes
diagonalized and quadratic in the corresponding elds [9]. thus the free eld representation
of the wznw model canonically arises. unfortunately, since in general the transformation to
the free variables is highly non-local, it is hard to describe it carefully. in fact, this way one
can only conjecture expressions for the conformal blocks (see [9] for more detailed discussion).
it is worth mentioning that there exists an alternative approach due to gawedzki et al. [20]
based on the correspondence between the chern-simons theory in the bulk that spans some
surface and the wznw model on this surface. this correspondence links the correlators in
wznw model and scalar product on the quantum states space of the cs theory. the last
one can be calculated using the iwasawa parameterization of the gauge eld. after that the
corresponding action also becomes gaussian and explicit expressions for the scalar products
can be obtained [20].

however it seems that at present a brief and clear description of such a point of view on the
wznw model is absent in literature. this paper is a small step in this direction. although
the problem of primary interest is that of the wznw model on higher genus, we start our
investigation with the simplest genus zero case. this subject has been studied previously, and
the paper can be partially taken as a survey. our other purpose here is to prepare the necessary
background for the second paper in the series, devoted to the higher genus case.

our ideology of the wznw model description is quite simple. the correlators and hence
conformal blocks should satisfy a set of the operator product expansions (ope), xed in boot-
strap approach [5, 21]. we realize these ope in terms of free elds thus ensuring in correct
local properties of our expressions. the correctness of the global properties follows then from
the useful fact that there are not so many good objects on riemann surface (a slang variant
of the riemann-roch theorem). this rough statement turns to be remarkably conrmed: as
the result, we obtain the well-known schechtman-varchenko solutions [22] of the knizhnik-za-
molodchikov equations.

to represent all the primary elds from the multiplet we introduce a generating function in a
way which is quite similar to the exponential map from algebraic to the group elements. we also
mention that one can use an alternative generating function from [17, 18], which corresponds

2

to the algebra representation on the polynomial ring. however, to compare the answers with
the solutions [22] one needs an exponential generating function.

let us list some results:

1. for the su(2)k wznw model we claim that the n-point correlator of the spinless
primary elds coincides with the n-point correlator of the dressed vertex operators in the
theory with the action

s =

1

4 z d2z


       + is 2

k + 2r +   exp

1
2

is 2

k + 2

(1.1)







the last term in the integrand is exactly marginal and one should calculate correlators as a
power series over this term. in fact, often after functional integration a single term survives in
expansion.

the dressed vertex operator associated with the primary eld from the highest weight j

representation is

vj = efl : ei

2
q j : efr

(1.2)

where fl and fr are the su(2) step generators, which form the left and right representa-
tions. thus, our claim is:

dj1

(z1, z1) . . . jn

(zn , zn )ew zn w

= const d vj1(z1, z1) . . . vjn (zn , zn )es

(1.3)

this construction may be easily generalized for other lie groups. as a result one can calculate
the n-point correlators in group g wznw model as correlators of dressed vertex operators
in the theory of free elds perturbed by exactly marginal terms. the number of the elds
necessary for bosonization is dened by the rank g while the marginal terms correspond to the
squared modules of simple screening currents.

2. as a result of the above suggestion we obtain expressions which satisfy all the require-

ments necessary for the wznw correlators:

i) the holomorphic factorization property

ii) correct conformal properties; this means that the behavior of a correlator as a function
of the primary elds insertion points under the change of coordinates on the surface is governed
by the stress-tensor and corresponding conformal dimensions

iii) satisfy the dierential (knizhnik-zamolodchikov) and additional algebraic equations,

which reects the null-vectors decomposition

iv) be a well-dened function of the primary elds insertion points; in other words, the
monodromy of the correlator when one insertion point is moved around the others should be
trivial.

3. we suggest a set of non-trivial integral identities, the simplest one is the following:

|x|1/3 |1  x|1/3z d2t1 |t1|2/3 |t1  x|2/3 |t1  1|2/3 

z d2t2 |t1  t2|4/3 |t2|2/3|t2  x|2/3 |t2  1|2/3 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
qxx(1  x)(1  x)

const

=

1

t1(t2  1)

+

1

t2(t1  1) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

=

(1.4)

all such identities occur in some exceptional cases, when an alternative way to solve the wznw
model exists. for instance, (1.4) corresponds to the su(2)k=1 case, when due to special circum-
stances all correlators can be represented in terms of single scalar bosonic eld with values on
self-dual circle, see section 5. we have checked some of them numerically. these tests ensure
us in correctness of the proposed construction.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we x notations and briey review the

basics of the bosonization technique.

in section 3 we describe how the schechtman-varchenko solutions of the knizhnik-zamo-
lodchikov equations can be obtained as certain correlators in the free chiral theory. as a
consequence, we obtain essential interpretation of the resonance conditions from [24] as a
neutrality condition on vertex operators in the free eld theory, which is necessary for obtaining
a non-vanishing result.

after that, in section 4 we turn to the problem of gluing correlators from the conformal
blocks. we use a simple prescription to obtain the conformal blocks: first, add to the free
(non-chiral) action exactly marginal terms which are squared modules of screening currents
integrated over whole surface in question. second, take the power series over these terms. the
method involved generalizes the dotsenko-fateev prescription for minimal models.

in section 5 we suggest a set of new integral identities. these identities arise when an al-
ternative way to solve the wznw model exists. the lhs and rhs are the correlators calculated
in two dierent ways. they have equal conformal, algebraic and analytical properties. more-
over, they obey the same dierential and algebraic equations. thus at least at physical level
we can conclude that they should be equal. this results in the non-trivial relations between
(generalized) hypergeometric functions. we have checked some of them numerically performing
a number of tests on proposed construction.

finally, section 6 describes various open problems and directions for future research.

2 basics of the bosonization technique

for most of the material presented in this section, see [9, 17] and references therein. we concen-
trate our attention on the su(2) algebra. after careful analysis of this case the generalization
for the arbitrary algebras is straightforward.

2.1 notations for the nite dimensional algebra

let g be a simple nite dimensional complex lie algebra of dim g = d and rankg = r. let h , i
be an invariant scalar product (killing form) on g normalized in such a way that h, i = 2,
 being the highest root. the set of positive roots is denoted +. the simple roots are
{i}i=1,...,r. for a vector space v, v will always denote the dual space. the cartan matrix
i + 1. commutator relations of the
is aij = hi , ji, the dual coxeter number is h =
chevalley generators ei, hi, fi (where subscript i is for the i) are:

pi=1

r

[hi, hj] = 0,

[ei, fj] = ijhj,

[hi, ej] = aijej,

[hi, fi] = aijfj

(2.1)

we will use the highest weight ~j = {j1, . . . , jr} representation of g, the highest weight vector
is denoted by (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(2.2)

~j,~0e:
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
~j, ~me = f m1

hi(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
~j,~0e = 2ji(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
relations (2.2) dene a verma module v(~j) over g.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
~j,~0e ,

. . . f mr

r

for the algebra su(2) generators e, f, h we have explicitly:

~j,~0e ,

ei(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
~j,~0e = 0.

[h, e] = 2e,

[h, f ] = 2f,

[e, f ] = h.

(2.3)

the highest weight representation with spin j  n/2 is:

|j, mi = f m |j, 0i ,

h|j, 0i = 2j |j, 0i ,

e|j, 0i = 0,

f 2j+1 |j, 0i = 0.

(2.4)

another useful algebra realization is given in terms of the dierential operators acting on the
polynomial ring c[x]. the su(2) realization is:

the polynomial highest weight representation follows from the identication:

f = x
h = 2xx  2j
e = x2x + 2jx




|j, mi 

x2jm
(2j  m)!

.

(2.5)

(2.6)

2.2 free elds

let us recall some facts about free elds of use to bosonization procedure. the rst is a scalar
massless bosonic eld  with values in the circle, described by the action:

5

s =

1

4 z 1

2

  d2z.

with equations of motion in mind it is useful to introduce chiral parts of the  eld:

(z, z) = l(z) + r(z)

then we obtain the following ope:

(2.7)

(2.8)

l(z)l(w) =  log(z  w) + o(1), r(z)r( w) =  log(z  w) + o(1).

(2.9)

from (2.7) a useful formula for the vertex operators correlator follows2:

* n
yi=1

: exp(ii(zi, zi)) :+s

(zi  zl)il(zi  zl)ili,0,

= yi<l

(2.10)

where the croneckers symbol comes from the integration over the -eld zero mode. the
holomorphic factorization in this expression is evident. the constraint i = 0 will be of great
importance for us. it is conventionally referred to as a neutrality condition.

the action (2.7) can be deformed to

sr =

1

4 z (cid:18)1

2

  + irg(cid:19) d2z,

(2.11)

where r and g are the two-dimensional scalar curvature and metric determinant correspond-
ingly. after choosing a special metric ds2 = |(z)|2 on a sphere, where (z) is a meromorphic
1-dierential, the last term in the integrand becomes proportional to the -function. it gives
the nonzero contribution only in the singular point r of the (z). thus from such a point of
view the term with the curvature results in the insertion of the vertex operator

vvac(r) =: exp (i(r)) :

(2.12)

to the point r of the surface. this operator is conventionally referred to as a vacuum
charge [19].

note that the eld  in modied action (2.11) should take values in the circle with the

radius dened by identication    + 2/.

the second of the elds is a bosonic  systems with  of spin 1 and  spin 0. there are

chiral and anti-chiral versions of the corresponding action:

2where i are just a complex numbers.

6

s =

1

4 z   d2z, s  =

1

4 z  d2z,

(2.13)

from which we read the following ope

(z)(w) =

1

z  w

+ o(1),

(z)( w) =

1

z  w

+ o(1).

(2.14)

general n-point correlators in  system are calculated using the wicks theorem and greens
functions of the  and  operators corresponding to the singular parts in the rhs of (2.14)

(2.15)

and a similar one for the anti-chiral system. the neutrality condition now is # = #.

2.3 free eld realization of the kac-moody algebras

let us concentrate on the holomorphic (chiral) objects. for the sake of brevity up to section
4 we will use the notation  for the chiral part l(z) of the (z, z). kac-moody algebra g
associated with the lie algebra g can be described in terms of currents j a(z) with ope

j a(z)j b(w) =

k
2

qab

(z  w)2 +

f ab
c
z  w

j c(w) + o(1),

(2.16)

where tensors f ab
the case of g = su(2) they have components:

c and qab are structure constants of algebra g and invariant killing form. for

q00 =

1
2

q+ = 1,

f +0 = 2,

f 0
 = f 0+

+ = 1.

(2.17)

it is an easy exercise to check, that the currents

j + = 

j 0 =:  : 

iq
2



(2.18)

j =  : 2 : +i2q + (q2  2)

form the su(2)k algebra at the level k = q2. note that these currents are obtained from the
dierential operator representation (2.5) by the substitution

  ,

x  ,

j 

iq
2



(2.19)

7

and a subsequent renormalization by adding an anomalous term (q2  2) to the last line of
the (2.18).

let the level k be an integer. as a next step we construct a nite-dimensional su(2)k highest

weight representation with spin j:

vj,0 = 2j

vj,1 = 2j1

2j

(2j)! : exp(cid:16)i
(2j1)! : exp(cid:16)i

q (cid:17) :
q (cid:17) :

2j

. . .

vj,2j = : exp(cid:16)i

2j

q (cid:17) :

(2.20)




the rst operator in this series is the highest weight vector of the representation, it has no
singularity in the ope with the rising current j. acting on vj,0 by the lowering current
j + one obtains all representation step by step. the series is truncated because of the vanishing
factor at the singular term in the ope j +(z)vj,2j(w). more explicitly,

j +(z)vj,m(w) = 1

j 0(z)vj,m(w) = jm

j(z)vj,m(w) = m(2jm)

zw vj,m1(w) + o(1)
zw vj,m(w) + o(1)
zw vj,m+1(w) + o(1)

(2.21)




the correspondence of (2.20) with the polynomial representation (2.6) is evident.

to study conformal properties of the vertex operators (2.20), we need a stress-tensor. it is

provided by the sugawara construction:

t (z) =

qab

k + h

: j a(z)j b(z) :

(2.22)

where h is a dual coxeter number (quadratic casimir operator in the adjoint representation),
h(su(n)) = n,
in the case of su(2) one obtains by direct
calculation:

and qab is dual to the qab.

t =:  : 

1
2

: ()2 : 

i
2q

2.

note that this stress-tensor corresponds to the action:

schiral =

1

4 z   1

2

     + i

2
q

rg! d2z,

where the term with the curvature induces the vacuum charge

8

(2.23)

(2.24)

vvac(r) =: exp i

2
q

(r)! :

(2.25)

from the ope with the stress-tensor (2.23), it follows that the conformal dimensions of all

the operators from the representation (2.20) are equal to

j =

j(j + 1)

k + 2

.

(2.26)

besides the primary family (2.20) there is one more operator of great importance to us  the
so-called screening current of the conformal dimension (1,0). the integrals of this current along
the closed contours are the screening charges (feigin-fuchs operators [23]). conformal blocks
are constructed as correlators of vertex operators (2.20) with the appropriate number of the
screening charges insertions [9, 10]. the crucial property of the screening charges is that they
commute with the kac-moody currents and have zero conformal dimension. thus insertion
of such operators does not aect the conformal and algebraic properties of the correlator,
but serves to screen out the extra charge to satisfy the neutrality condition. for the su(2)
conformal blocks we will use the following screening charge [9]:

i dts(t) = i (z) : exp i

2
q

(z)! : dz

(2.27)

let us briey discuss the free eld realization for the arbitrary kac-moody algebra g. (for
more details see [17, 18] and references therein.) one starts with the dierential operator
realization of the associated lie algebra g on the polynomial ring c[x], given by the following
expressions for the chevalley generators:

e(x, ) = w 

 (x)

hi(x, , j) = w 

i (x) + i

f(x, , j) = w 

(x) + p l

(x)l




then one introduces a r copies of the free , ,  elds with ope:

i(z)j(w) = ij log(z  w),

i(z)j(w) =

ij
z  w

.

(2.28)

(2.29)

after that the expressions for the corresponding kac-moody currents are obtained by the
substitution:

i  i(z),

xi  i(z),

i  iqi(z)

(2.30)

9

and a subsequent renormalization by adding an anomalous term f anom
((z), (z)) to the lower
part of the (2.28). the primary elds are given in the terms of the following vertex operators:

i

v~j, ~m(z) =

m

yi=1

2jimi
(z)

(2ji  mi)!

the screening currents (of the rst kind, in the termininology of [17, 18]) are:

(2.31)

(2.32)

3 conformal blocks

3.1 knizhnik-zamolodchikov and additional algebraic equations

it is well known, that the correlators in wznw theory satisfy the system of dierential equa-
tions rst found by knizhnik and zamolodchikov3 [5]:






zi xl6=i

ta
i ta
l

zi  zl

h1(z1, z1) . . . n (zn , zn )iw zn w = 0

(3.1)

where ta
is a generator of algebra g that acts on the primary eld i belonging to the ith
i
representation. the summation over the a indices in (3.1) is assumed. the (complex) parameter
 is equal to k + h. due to the holomorphic factorization property of the correlators in
conformal eld theory [21] we have:

h1(z1, z1) . . . n (zn , zn )iw zn w = xa,b

c ab fa(z1, . . . , zn ) fb(z1, . . . , zn ).

(3.2)

where the gluing constants c ab are related to the structure constants of operator algebra. in
fact, (3.1) is a system of dierential equations on the so-called conformal blocks fa(~z). from
the mathematical point of view, conformal block is a multivalued function (to be more precise,
section of a holomorphic bundle over the moduli space of the principal g-bundles over the
punctured cp1) of the n variables ~z  (z1, . . . , zn ) with values in the tensor product of n
verma modules v(~j1). . .v(~jn ) over g. in notation from the subsection 2.1 the kz equations
looks like:

3there is an antiholomorphic system of equation as well.

hj(z)j1(z1) . . . jn (zn )iw zn w = 0

(3.5)

3.2 su(2) case

to represent all the primary elds from the multiplet, we will introduce a generating function
that contains all vertex operators from the (2.20). we are interested in generating function of
a special form, having the following ope with the kac-moody currents:

j a(z)(w) =

ta
z  w

(w) + o(1).

(3.6)

this form of ope is xed in the bootstrap approach [5]. it is easy to check that the generating
function4

vj =

2j

xm=

vj,mf 2jm

indeed has ope (3.6) with the su(2)k currents (2.18):

j +(z) vj(w) = f
zw

vj(w) + o(1)

h(z) vj(w) = h
zw
j(z) vj(w) = e
zw

vj(w) + o(1)

vj(w) + o(1)




the sum (3.7) can be rewritten in a more suitable form

vj(z)  : exp i

2
q

j(z)! : exp ((z)f ) ,

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

4the terms which contain f n, n > 2j vanish when vj acts on the vacuum vector |j, 0i, so they are not

important.

11

to which we will refer as to a dressed vertex operator. note that this form of the generating
function is quite similar to the exponential mapping from algebra to a group.

now we are ready to calculate the conformal blocks. the prescription is quite simple  we
should take the holomorphic part of the dressed vertex operator n-point correlator with a
proper number n of the screening charges:

fa(~z) = ia

dt1 . . . dtnds(t1) . . . s(tn) vj1(z1) . . . vjn (zn )eschiral

~v.

(3.10)

where the average with the chiral action (2.24) is assumed. the label a marks dierent inte-
gration contours. the number n in this formula is dictated by the neutrality condition:

n =

xi=1

ji + 1,

(3.11)

3.3 simple complex lie algebras

as we already mentioned, generalization of this construction to an arbitrary simple complex
lie algebra g is straightforward. one needs just to pass through three stages:

13

i) introduce the free chiral action:

1

sr =

4 z d2z 1
where ~ = {1, . . . , r}, r = rank g, ~a~b 
of all positive roots.

2

~  ~  ~ ~ + irg
pi=1

q

r

~~! ,

(3.21)

aibi, q = k + h and ~ stands for the half-sum

ii) introduce the generating function:

v~j(z) = exp(cid:16)~(z) ~fl(cid:17) : exp i

2
q

~j ~(z)! :

iii) introduce the screening currents

si(z) =: w 

i((z)) (z) exp i

2
q

~(z)! :

as a result for the algebra g conformal blocks one obtains:

a (~z) = ia

yi=1

(si(ti[1]) . . . si(ti[ki])) v~j1(z1) . . . v~jn

(zn )+sr

(3.22)

(3.23)

(3.24)

for some {k1, . . . , kr} dened by a neutrality condition. after functional integration the expres-
sion which coincides with the schechtman-varchenko solution arises (see also [11, 26]).

4 correlators

4.1 su (2) case

now we turn to the problem of constructing correlators h1(z1, z1) . . . n (zn , zn )iw zn w .
in more detail the spinless primary eld multiplet j (z, z) corresponding to the conformal
dimension j = j(j+1)
k+2

looks like

j (z, z) =

2j

xm, m=0

cmc m m m

j (z, z) f m

l  f m

r

(4.1)

with some constants cm, m dened in such a way that ope (3.8) for j (z, z) holds. upper
indices m and m are for dierent primary elds from the left and right multiplet receptively.
to glue correlators from the conformal blocks according to the (3.2) we need to know the
gluing constants c ab. they are determined by the natural physical condition on correlators to
be single-valued functions of the primary elds complex coordinates (z, z). in mathematical
language, the monodromy with respect to a moving point in the correlator around the others

14

should be trivial. the most naive way to obtain an expression with such a property is simply
to get the squared modules of the conformal blocks and replace the integration over contours
with the integration over the whole surface. provided that there is a single choice of c ab (this
is natural from the physicists point of view) these prescription will give a correct answer. thus
formally we can write:

 z

n

yi=1

(z1, z1) . . . jn

(zn , zn )ew zn w

dj1
d2ti (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ds(t1) . . . s(tn) vj1(z1) . . . vjn (zn )e (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

~v  ~v 

2

~v  ~v.

(4.2)

one can restore original conformal blocks and gluing constants using the following formula
which expresses the integral over the riemann surface  in terms of the integrals over canonical
a, b circles on this surface:

z

   = xa,b(cid:18) ia

 ib

 ib

 ia

 (cid:19) .

(4.3)

where  and  are arbitrary holomorphic 1-dierentials. the riemann surface  in our case is
a branch covering of cp1 dened by the multivalued form (3.12) connected with the proper con-
formal block. corresponding methods of calculation are in fact well known from the dotsenko-
fateev [19, 27] representation for minimal models where the same construction is used. as an
example of operator algebra structure constants calculation see [19, 28].

to be more precise we should substitute the following dressed vertex operator

vj(z, z) = exp ((z)fl) : exp i

2
q

jl(z)! : : exp i

2
q

jr(z)! : exp ((z)fr)

(4.4)

for the squared modulus of the vj(z) from (4.2). here fl and fr are the su(2) step generators
which form the left and right representations. we should also substitute expression

scr(t, t) = (t) (t) exp i

2
q

(t, t)!

(4.5)

for the squared modulus of the screening currents. therefore,

dj1

(z1, z1) . . . jn

(zn , zn )ew zn w

~v  ~v =

d2ti dscr(t1, t1) . . . scr(tn, tn) vj1(z1, z1) . . . vjn (zn , zn )es0

is assumed. remarkable, expression (4.6) can be rewritten in more simple and profound form
using an old idea suggested by a. m. polyakov and developed by dotsenko and fateev in [19].
namely, consider the model with the action s = s0 + sint, where interacting term is equal to

sint = z d2z   exp i

2
q

!

(4.8)

and is exactly marginal because of the zero conformal dimension of the exponent. explicitely,

s =

4 z d2z( 1

       + i

2
q rg +   exp i

!) .

(4.9)

all correlators in this model are calculated by expanding in sint. as we know, the correlator

* n
yi=1

exp (il)+

(4.10)

will not vanish only if the neutrality condition pl l = 0 holds. therefore, only one term in the
series survive, and this is exactly the term in rhs of the (4.6). thus, we identify the wznw
correlators of primary elds (ji) with the dressed vertex operator correlators in theory with
the action s:

dj1

(z1, z1) . . . jn

4.2 simple complex lie groups

generalization of the construction from previous subsection for other groups is obvious. let us
introduce the action

s~~~ =

~  ~  ~ ~  ~~ + irg

q

~~ +

i()w

and the generating function:

v~j(z, z) = exp(cid:16)~(z) ~fl(cid:17) exp i

2
q

~j ~(z, z)! exp(cid:16)~(z) ~fr(cid:17)

then for n-point correlator we obtain the following representation:

d(~j1)(z1, z1) . . . (~jn )(zn , zn )ew zn w
= z d[~, ~, ~, ~, ~] exp(s~~~) v~j1(z1, z1) . . . v~jn

~v  ~v =

(zn , zn ) ~v  ~v.

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

to obtain expression for the correlator in polynomial representation on needs just to sub-

stitute exponential generating function by the corresponding polynomial one.

5 new integral identities

5.1 a simple test

now we do some tests on the proposed construction. it is well known that the su(2)k=1 wznw
model can be represented in terms of one  eld with values in the self-dual circle. the su(2)k=1
currents are:

j + = ei2,

j0 = i2,

j = ei2

the are only two non-trivial primary elds correspond to the spin 1/2 representation:

 = e

i
2

,  = e i

2



the 4-point correlator obviously is

h(0)(x, x)(1)()iw zn w =

const

qxx(1  x)(1  x)

from the other hand, the general expression (4.11) in this case gives:

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.3)

h(0)(x)(1)()iw zn w  |x|1/3 |1  x|1/3z d2t1 |t1|2/3 |t1  x|2/3 |t1  1|2/3 

z d2t2 |t1  t2|4/3 |t2|2/3|t2  x|2/3 |t2  1|2/3 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

t2(t1  1) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

.

(5.4)

the equality of this two dierent expressions for the correlator seems to be a non-trivial fact. it
can be easily checked numerically. let us describe some steps which reduce the problem to the
statement that some 2-fold integrals over the surface must vanish. this statement was checked
with the help of the mathematica 3.0 program. as a rst step we change the integration
variables:

t1 = t1x,

t2 = t2  (t2  1)x,

(5.5)

so that the rhs of (5.4) takes the form

18

1

qxx(1  x)(1  x) z d2t1 |t1|2/3 |1  t1|2/3 |1  xt1|2/3 
z d2t2 |1  t2|2/3 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

if the rhs of (5.3) and (5.4) are equal, integral in (5.6) should not depend on x. in order to
check it, we expand this integral to the series in x. as a result of the numerical calculation
it turns out that at least 8 rst coecients cn (n  1) in front of the xn terms in this series
vanish.

5.2 applications

new integral identities arise when an alternative way to solve the wznw model exists.
in
these identities lhs and rhs are the correlators calculated in two dierent ways. they have
equal conformal, algebraic and analytical properties. moreover, they obey the same dierential
and algebraic equations. thus at least at physical level we can conclude that they should be
equal.

the su(2)k=1 wznw 2n-point correlator, calculated with help of bosonization (5.2) is

1 = j1 + j2 + j3 + j4 + 1,

2 = k + j1 + j2  j3  j4 + 1,
3 = k + j1 + j3  j2  j4 + 1.

(5.14)

to obtain new integral identities one can also use expressions for the su(n)k 4-point correlators
of the primary elds belonging to the fundamental representation [5]. as a result proper
multiple integrals (4.11) become expressed in terms of the basic hypergeometric functions 2f1.

6 conclusions, speculations and outlook

in this paper we considered the free eld approach or bosonization technique for the wess-
zumino-novikov-witten model with arbitrary kac-moody algebra on genus zero riemann sur-
face. we show how to obtain schechtman-varchenko solutions of the knizhnik-zamolodchikov
equations as certain correlators in free chiral theory thus providing a simple description of space
of the wznw conformal blocks. we also propose a simple prescription for gluing correlators
from the conformal blocks, quite similar to the dotsenko-fateev prescription for the minimal
models [19].

this construction has a simple interpretation in the functional integral language. namely,
one can attribute the additional marginal terms in action (screening generators) to the func-
tional measure by means of the corresponding -function insertions. thus wznw model
becomes essentially embedded in a certain subsector of the free elds theory.
it is worth
mentioning the analogy of such description with the powerful projection method from the
integrable systems theory [29].

interesting insight on bosonized action arises from the non-critical string theory. let us
discuss the simplest case. consider the bosonic polyakov string propagating in two dimensions.
for many reasons it is useful to compactify it in a certain way. for instance, one can consider
as a target space cp1 with the complex coordinates (, ). the conformal anomaly results in
metric dependence governed by the liouville action  this is the way how the  eld arises. all
elds become dressed by the liouville eld  they acquire factors like e where  denes
the anomalous dimension. at the moment the possible dynamics of such a non-perturbative
process is absolutely unknown. but if we are interested in the case when the resulting string
theory has a current algebra on the world-sheet, the form of the possible terms in eective
action is strongly constrained. for instance, the liouville interaction term is forbidden (!)
since it results in screening charge which does not commute with the currents. in fact, the only
possibility is the action s (1.1) corresponding to the su(2) theory or conjugated action
si corresponding to the sl(2, c) theory. (note that the  eld can be easily integrated
out.) of course, this is nothing but speculation. however, it gives us an alternative way to
think about our construction and brings an interesting link to such a long-standing problem of
mathematical physics as liouville theory.

it is worth mentioning renewed interest to the bosonization of the wznw models related to

21

the strings propagating on ads3s3, ads2d+1s2d+1 [30, 31, 32]. this interest is motivated by
dualities between certain cfts and string theories on anti-de-sitter spaces with rr uxes [33].

an intriguing direction for future research comes from the observation [22] that kz equations
and their sv solutions can be generalized to the case when g itself is an arbitrary kac-moody
algebra associated with the symmetriable cartan matrix. these generalized kz equations
should correspond to the loop group wznw model while generalized conformal blocks should
correspond to the some two-loop algebra representations. such objects are very important for
the unication of conformal and two-dimensional integrable models as points on the string
theory conguration space [34].

we also believe that the tools described in the paper will help us to understand deeper
and generalize the intriguing interplay between langlands duality and sklyanins separation of
variables [26, 35].

to summarize, we suggest the following prescription, which generalizes that one from [9, 19]:
n-point correlators of the spinless primary elds in the genus zero wznw model coincide with
the n-point correlators of the dressed vertex operators in theory of free (, , )-elds per-
turbed by the exactly marginal terms corresponding to the squared modules of simple screening
currents. as one of the possible applications of this prescription, we have obtained a set of new
integral identities between (naively) dierent hypergeometric functions.

further development of these methods and generalization of the proposed construction to

the higher genus case will appear elsewhere.
