abstract

we show that symmetries are preserved exactly along the (wilsonian) renor-
malization group ow, though the ir cuto deforms concrete forms of the trans-
formations. for a gauge theory the cuto dependent ward-takahashi identity is
written as the master equation in the antield formalism: one may read o the
renormalized brs transformation from the master equation. the maxwell theory
is studied explicitly to see how it works. the renormalized brs transformation
becomes non-local but keeps o-shell nilpotency. our formalism is applicable for a
generic global symmetry. the master equation considered for the chiral symmetry
provides us with the continuum analog of the ginsparg-wilson relation and the
luschers symmetry.

1 introduction

the wilsonian renormalization group (rg) is one of the most important achievements
in modern physics[1]. in particular, the exact rg equations[2-4] have proved to be power-
ful both in perturbative and non-perturbative studies of eld theories1. in a eld theory,
quantum uctuations at shorter distances are integrated out to give an eective action for
longer distances. for the well-dened integration, one needs to introduce some regulariza-
tion procedure, which may be in conict with symmetries in many important applications:
for example, the presence of gauge symmetry or chiral symmetry is far from trivial. the
incompatibility of symmetries and regularizations is a longstanding problem in the rg
approach.

there have been several attempts[10-13] recently to investigate this problem based on
a common recognition: a symmetry is broken at intermediate steps of the rg iteration,
and is recovered only after the ir cuto k is removed. the breaking of the symmetry
is controlled by the modied ward-takahashi (wt) identity, k = 0[14]. in practical
calculations, one has to nely tune parameters in an eective action so that it satises
the usual wt identity in the limit of k  0. this viewpoint, recovery of the symmetry
by ne tuning, is due to becchi[10] and extensively studied in refs. [11], [12] and [14].

recent development in understanding chiral symmetry on the lattice has brought
another important clue to our problem: luscher found an exact chiral symmetry on the
lattice[15], relying on the ginsparg-wilson (gw) relation[16]. this provides us with the
rst non-trivial example of having an exact symmetry even after the regularization. the
luschers chiral symmetry takes quite dierent form from that in the continuum limit.

based on these observations, we shall give in this paper a general method to dene
global symmetry along a rg ow. it may be non-local and cuto dependent, yet exact
symmetry even for k 6= 0. we call this renormalized symmetry. remarkably, our
discussion applies to gauge symmetry as well by considering its global counterpart, the
brs symmetry.

we begin with a microscopic or uv action which is local and invariant under a sym-
metry transformation. in order to construct the eective action at low momentum, we
consider the continuum analog of the blockspin transformation. this formalism developed
in[4] introduces macroscopic elds (average elds), in terms of which the renormalized
symmetry is realized. the important role of the macroscopic elds is also suggested by
the gw relation and the luschers chiral symmetry. since the blockspin transformation
is a gaussian integral, we obtain an exact rg ow equation[4] for the eective action of
the macroscopic elds. when expressed by the macroscopic elds and some source elds,
the wt identity k = 0 takes the form of a master equation, from which we shall nd the
exact symmetry transformation for k 6= 0. we would like to emphasize here that our wt
identity is for the exact renormalized symmetry, not for the broken or modied symmetry.
this is the central issue of our formulation of renormalized symmetry. the ow equation
for k holds as a result of the algebraic relation between the operator specifying the rg

1see eg [5][6] for non-perturbative studies, [7-9] for reviews of the recent development.

ow and that appeared in the wt identity.

for gauge theories, the master equation is nothing but the one in the antield for-
malism of batalin and vilkovisky[17]. in order to see how the renormalized symmetry
looks like, we give an eective action and a renormalized brs symmetry for the maxwell
theory. as another test of our method, we consider chiral symmetry, and show that our
master equation and associated renormalized symmetry are the continuum analog of the
gw relation and the luschers symmetry. in our derivation the gw relation is regarded
as an exact wt identity for the chiral symmetry.

2 general formalism

let a be a microscopic eld2with the grassmann parity (a) = a and s[a] a generic
action. the microscopic or uv action is assumed to be invariant as[] = 0 under
an innitesimal global transformation with parameters a, a  a + aaa, where
(a) = (a). the discussion to be given also applies to gauge theory: the action s[] is
a gauge xed action and the relevant global transformation is the brs transformation.

to specify a blockspin transformation, we introduce a function fk(p) with an ir cut-
o k in the euclidean momentum space, and an invertible matrix [rk(p)]ab satisfying
([rk(p)]ab) = 0, [rk(p)]ab = (1)ab [rk(p)]ba. for a boundary condition, we impose
[rk(p)]ab   as k  . possible choices of fk(p) and [rk(p)]ab were
fk(p)  1,
discussed in [4], but we do not need to specify them here. let k a
a be sources for the
variations aa: they will play an important role in our symmetry consideration. we
may dene an eective action for the macroscopic elds a in the presence of the sources
by

ek[,k] = z desk[,,k],

2

sk[, , k] = s[] +

(  fk)t

 rk (  fk)+ + k t

aa+,

(2.1)

where   (p) and their multiplication implies the integration over momentum as
well as the sum over the index a, eg,

t

rk+ = str(rk+t

)  zp

a(p)[rk(p)]abb(p),

zp

 z ddp.

(2.2)

the supertrace, str, denotes a sum over momenta and indices. note that fk[rk]abb, a
linear term of the macroscopic elds, acts as a source term for a in the path integral.

since only the gaussian term depends on the cuto k, one obtains the exact rg ow

equation[4] for the macroscopic action k[, k] :

kek[,k] = (cid:20)x +

str(r1

k krk1) + str(k(ln fk)1)(cid:21) ek[,k],

2the index a denotes kinds of elds and other indices as a whole, except eld momentum.

we consider now the symmetry property of the macroscopic action. invariance of the

microscopic action under the global transformation can be expressed as

z desk[+aa,,k]  z desk[,,k] = 0.

(2.4)

assumed here is the translational invariance of the path integral measure, ie, the absence
of anomalies. for each independent parameter a, the wt identity reads

ka[, k]  ek[,k]aek[,k] = hk t

bab+ik,

(2.5)

where the expectation value is taken with respect to the action sk and the operator a
is dened by

one obtains

(2.7)

 + ak.

this takes the form of a master equation in the space of (a, k a
a). as will be seen
presently, for the brs symmetry the source ka(p)/fk(p) can be identied with the anti-
eld of the macroscopic eld a, and (2.5) becomes the quantum master equation.

in oder to obtain the ow equation for ka in our formulation, we notice that there is

an algebraic relation between operator x in (2.3) and the operator a:

[a, x] = (ka)

on any grassmann even quantity. this leads to the ow equation[14]

kka = (ekxek)ka  ekx (ekka).

(2.8)

(2.9)

it is easily seen that the r.h.s consists of the functional derivatives of ka.

the above equations (2.5)  (2.9) hold quite generally. they also provide us with the
transformation for the renormalized symmetry. in the following two sections we consider
the brs and global symmetry separately.

3 renormalized brs symmetry

3.1 the master equation

for the brs symmetry, the source ka(p)/fk(p) can be identied with the antield 
a
for the macroscopic eld a. then, the operator  in (2.6) and a bracket dened by

(f, g)  zp"

a(p)





rf

a(p)# ,

(3.1)

are exactly those in the antield formalism of batalin-vilkovisky[17]. since the r.h.s of
(2.5) vanishes because of the nilpotency 2=0, one obtains the condition,

k[, ] =

1
2

(k[, ], k[, ]) + k[, ] = 0,

(3.2)

which is nothing but the quantum master equation.
it is an algebraic equation which
holds for any  and . the wt ow equation (2.9) tells us then that once it is satised
at some cuto k = k0 it persists along the rg ow. this clearly demonstrates the
presence of a cuto dependent brs symmetry, a renormalized brs symmetry, in the
macroscopic action. if the second term in the master equation vanishes, we may dene
the renormalized brs transformation on  and  by

ra = (a, k[, ]),

r

a = (

a, k[, ]).

(3.3)

the cuto dependent brs transformation appeared earlier in a dierent context[10].
the author took the viewpoint to nely tune the eective action for k 6= 0 with gauge
non-invariant terms so that it satises the usual wt identity in k  0 limit. a series
of papers followed to conrm this point of view perturbatively for various models[11].
the modied slavnov-taylor identity and its ow equation are elegantly summarized
in [14]. however the presence of the exact brs symmetry had not been understood.

here we have seen that the transformation may be dened with the master equation
in the antield formalism, and the wt identity k = 0 is not a broken but exact identity.
in the next subsection we shall give a simple model of the renormalized brs symmetry
for the maxwell theory, where the above stated properties can be conrmed explicitly.

3.2 abelian gauge symmetry

let us consider the gauge-xed maxwell action in d=4 minkowski space,

s0[, ] = z (cid:20)

scopic level.3 the macroscopic elds,

(3.9)

we have chosen the blockspin kernel, the gaussian term, like a mass term : both mk(p)
and k(p) have the dimension of mass.

all the terms are bilinear so that we may obtain the macroscopic action explicitly,

since k = 0, one obtains the renormalized brs transformation for  as

ra(p) = fk

rc(p) = rb(p) = 0,

in spite of the non-locality and the operator mixing, the renormalized brs transforma-
tion is nilpotent on c(p), which may be easily conrmed once we take account of the
transformation of the antield c(p),

rc(p) = fk

lk

 c(p)

k a(p)p2c(p).

(3.12)

with similar calculations, one can obtain renormalized brs transformations of other
antields and explicitly observe their (o-shell) nilpotency.

the above mentioned complication of r is partly caused by the bilinear term in the
antields appeared in k. a canonical transformation may be used to make the action
linear in antields, which will not be discussed further.

4 renormalized global symmetry

we now discuss other global symmetry. in this case, the r.h.s. of (2.5) does not vanish
in general. therefore, to obtain the wt identity we need to set k = 0 after taking the
functional derivatives in (2.5):

ka[] = 

str
fk

lk

   lk

k a

+!t
 + ak
k=0

= 0.

(4.1)

this is an algebraic relation to hold for any . unlike the brs symmetry, we have no
natural bracket structure4. yet, since the operator x contains no functional derivatives
with respect to k, the wt ow equation (2.9) is unchanged: it persists again along the rg
ow. thus, the quantum master equation (4.1) ensures the presence of renormalized global
symmetry.
in the absence of the ak term, the transformation for the renormalized
symmetry is given by

ra(p) = fk(p)"

lk

a(p)#k=0

k a

.

(4.2)

we now apply our formalism to the chiral symmetry. let (, ), (, ) be micro-
scopic and macroscopic fermion elds, respectively. we introduce the sources (k, k) for
the variations ( = i5,  = i5). the macroscopic action is given by

ek[,,k,k] = z ddesk[,,,,k,k],

where

sk[, , , , k, k]

= s[, ] + (  fk)k(  fk)+  +i5k + k i5+.

(4.3)

k is a function of k and p. the gaussian contains linear terms in  and :

 kfk(cid:20)(cid:16)  (kfk)1ki5(cid:17)

+ + (cid:16) + (kfk)1i5k(cid:17)+(cid:21) .

4for a grassmann odd symmetry such as supersymmetry, however, we may dene a bracket in the

(4.4)

space of (a, k a

a).

6

generically these are the only terms which act eectively as sources for (, ) in the path
integral. if we assume the macroscopic action to be bilinear in the macroscopic fermions,
it takes the form,

k[, , k, k] = (  (kfk)1ki5)(d  k)( + (kfk)1i5k)+

+ k+,

(4.5)

where d denotes the dirac operator for the macroscopic elds, dened as the coecient
of  +. then the master equation (4.1) gives

k[, ] = ihd5(1  1

k d) + (1  1

k d)5di + = 0

(4.6)

where we have used tr{5, d} = 0, which is legitimate in the absence of chiral anomalies.
one obtains in this way the continuum analog of the gw relation:

{5, d} = 21

k d 5 d.

(4.7)

since the second term in (4.1) vanishes owing to tr{5, d} = 0, the chiral transfor-

mation on the macroscopic elds is readily given by

r = fk

r = fk

lk
k
lk
k

= i5(1  1

k d),

= i(1  1

k d)5,

(4.8)

which is nothing but the luschers symmetry transformation. for the chiral symmetry,
therefore, the master equation k = 0 is identied with the gw relation. the ow equa-
tion (2.9) tells us that it persists along the rg ow. the luschers symmetry turns out
to be the renormalized symmetry realized on the ow. it is probably worth pointing out
that the variants in luschers symmetry[15] are naturally understood in our formulation:
an arbitrary vector perpendicular to rk/a may be added to the transformation since
it does not change the condition k = 0.

so far we have discussed for as[] = 0. before closing this section, let us consider
briey the microscopic action with some non-invariant terms, as[] 6= 0. the presence
of as[] gives a new contribution in (2.5). now ka[] does not vanish even after taking
k = 0. it should be remarked however that the non-vanishing term dened by

still satises the ow equation

ka[] = has[]ik

kka = (ek x ek)ka  ekx (ek ka).

(4.9)

(4.10)

this equation gives us some important information on the rg ow of the couplings for
the non-invariant terms. it is straightforward to extend the eqs.(4.9) and (4.10) to the
case of the brs symmetry.

5 summary

we have shown that a symmetry, not compatible with a given regularization, may survive
exactly along the rg ow. the concrete realization of the symmetry reects deformation
due to the regularization.5 naturally it reduces to the usual form in the k   limit.
in this letter we have presented a general formalism based on the average action, a
continuum cousin of the blockspin transformation. the wt identity for the renormal-
ized symmetry takes the form of the master equation, from which we may read o the
associated transformation on the macroscopic elds.

the maxwell theory was found to be a simple yet instructive example to understand
the renormalized brs transformation. as a result of the blockspin transformation it
became non-local but still kept the o-shell nilpotency, as it should from our general
argument. for the chiral symmetry in a continuum theory, we have identied the gw
relation with the wt identity k = 0. our formalism naturally leads us to identify the
renormalized chiral symmetry with the luschers symmetry. this is regarded as another
non-trivial example of the renormalized symmetries.
