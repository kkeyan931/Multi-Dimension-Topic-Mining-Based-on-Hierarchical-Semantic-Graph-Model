abstract

we present a complete proof that solutions of the wdvv equations in seiberg-witten
theory may be constructed from root systems. a generalization to weight systems is
proposed.

introduction

recently in n = 2 four-dimensional supersymmetric yang-mills theory (seiberg-witten
effective theory) the following remarkable system of generalized wdvv equations emerged
[1, 2]:

i, j, k = 1, . . . , n,

(1)

fif 1

k fj = fjf 1
where fi is the matrix
3f

k fi

(fi)mr =

aiamar

of third order derivatives of a function f (a1, . . . , an).

this system of nonlinear equations is satisfied by the seiberg-witten prepotential
defining the low-energy effective action. moreover the leading perturbative approximation
to this exact seiberg-witten prepotential should satisfy this set of equations by itself. for
instance for the gauge group su (n) the expression

fpert =

4 x

(ai  aj)2 log(ai  aj)2 +

defines a solution of the generalized wdvv-system (1).

of course other gauge groups may be considered and more general solutions may be
proposed for classical lie groups [3, 4]. so although extremely difficult to solve in general,
this overdetermined system of nonlinear equations admit exact solutions. in this note we
shall present a complete proof that a substantial class of solutions for the system (1) may
be constructed from root systems of semisimple lie algebras.

2 solutions from root systems

actually we have the following result.

theorem 2.1 let r be the root system of a semisimple lie algebra g. then the function

f (a) =

1
4 x

r

(, a)2 log(, a)2

(2)

dened on the cartan subalgebra h of g satises the generalized wdvv equations (1).

here the bracket represents the killing form of g.

in order to prove this theorem we show that we can rewrite the system (1) into an

equivalent form which is more suitable for our purposes.

proposition 2.1 let g =

cifi be an invertible linear combination of the matrices fi

with coecients ci which may depend on a.

n

p

i=1

then f is a solution of the wdvv-system (1) if and only if

fig1fj = fjg1fi

i, j = 1, . . . , n.

(3)

proof. suppose f satisfies the wdvv-system (1). then by inverting these equations

we obtain

f 1
j fkf 1

i = f 1

i fkf 1

j

.

by taking linear combinations we get

f 1
j gf 1

i = f 1

i gf 1

j

.

inverting once more yields the equations (3). to prove the converse we set ci = g1fi.

then (3) implies that ci and cj commute. so

g1fif 1

k fj = cic 1

k cj = cjc 1

k ci = g1fjf 1

k fi.

thus f is a solution of the wdvv-system (1).
we continu by proving our main result, theorem 2.1. without restriction we may
suppose that the root system is irreducible. let 1, . . . , n be a basis of the cartan

subalgebra h of the lie algebra g consisting of simple roots. moreover let a =

n

p

i=1

aii.

for the linear combination g = pn

i=1 aifi, where f is given in (2), we have

gkm = x

aifikm = x

i

i

ai x
r

(, i)(, k)(, m)

(, a)

r

(, k)(, m) = (k, m)

using the very definition of the killing form. so in this case g equals the matrix of the
killing form on a basis of simple roots.

for this choice of g we have

(cid:0)fig1fj(cid:1)rs = 4 x

,r+

(, i)(, r)(, )(, j )(, s)

where r+ denotes the positive part of the root system. consequently

(cid:0)fig1fj  fjg1fi(cid:1)rs = 4 x

,r+

(, )(, r )(, s)[(, i)(, j )  (, j )(, i)]

(, a)(, a)

we have to prove that this last expression vanishes, but by a close inspection we see

that it is antisymmetric in r, s. therefore we may also prove that

(cid:0)fig1fj  fjg1fi(cid:1)rs  (cid:0)fig1fj  fjg1fi(cid:1)sr

vanishes. this last expression equals

4 x
,r+

(, )[(, i)(, j )  (, j )(, i)][(, r)(, s)  (, s)(, r)]

(, a)(, a)

which we abbreviate to

= x
{,}

t{,},

(4)

where {, } denotes an unordered pair of different roots ,  in r+. to finish our proof
we consider two separate cases. first we consider the case that the lie algebra g is simply-
laced. in this case the roots have equal length which we suppose to be normalized so that
the squared lengths equal 2.

now consider a (unordered) pair of roots {, } in r+ such that (, ) < 0. then
since the roots have equal length it follows (see table 1, p.45 in [5]) that (, ) = 1 and
therefore (lemma 2, p.45 in [5]) that  +  is again a root in r+. moreover: (,  + ) = 1,
(,  + ) = 1. conversely if {, } is a pair of roots in r+ such that (, ) > 0 then
necessarily (, ) = 1 and a small calculation shows that there is a unique pair of roots
{, } in r+ such that {, } = {,  + } or {, } = {,  + }.

consequently in this simply-laced case the sum p
{,}

t{,} may be split up into a sum

of expressions of the form

t{,} + t{,+} + t{,+},

(5)

where {, } represents an anordered pair of roots in r+ with (, ) = 1. using the
relation

(, a)(, a)

(, a)( + , a)

(, a)( + , a)

it is now easy to see that the expression (5) and with it the sum (4) vanishes. this
completes the proof of the theorem in the simply-laced case.

in the non simply-laced case we have to consider also pair of roots of unequal length.
first observe that when the root system is of type g2 the dimension of the cartan
subalgebra equals 2 and therefore the theorem becomes trivial. so we may ignore this
special case. in the other non simply-laced cases the ratio of the squared length of a long
and a short root equals 2. we may assume the length of the short root to be equal to 1.
now consider a pair {, } of roots in r+ with  a short and  a long root such that
(, ) < 0. then it follows (table 1, p. 45 in [5]) that (, ) = 1. we construct the

-string through . it consists of ,  + ,  + 2. for the inner product of the roots
, ,  + ,  + 2 we have

(,  + ) = ( + ,  + 2) = (,  + 2) = 1

and

(,  + 2) = (,  + ) = 0.

we obtain three pairs { + , }, { + , 2 + }, {, 2 + } of a short and a long
root with inner product equal to 1. conversely, a simple calculation shows that each pair
{, } with  short,  long and (, ) = 1 is obtained uniquely in this way.using the
relation

(, a)(, a)

( + , a)(, a)

( + , a)(2 + , a)

(, a)(2 + , a)

it is now easily seen that

t{,} + t{+,} + t{+,2+} + t{,2+} = 0.

for pairs of equal length we may argue as in the simply-laced case. consequently
t{,} split up into vanishing parts consisting of three or four terms. this

the sum p

completes the proof of the theorem in the non simply-laced case.

as is well-known a root system is the weight system of the adjoint representation of
some semisimple lie algebra g. so one may try to construct more general solutions in
terms of weight systems.

actually generalizing the expression (2) in a natural way we obtain for any represen-

tation  of the lie algebra g the function

f(a) = x
w

(a)2 log (a)2

(6)

defined on the cartan subalgebra h of g. here summation is over the set of weights of the
representation .

from experience with concrete representations we know that unfortunately in general
formula (6) does not satisfy the wdvv equations despite the fact that for some represen-
tations the wdvv equations indeed hold. for a short review from the point of view of
physics see e.g. [4]. to our best knowledge at present no precise results are known in the
literature. we hope to report on these questions in the near future.
