abstract

theories of partial supersymmetry breaking n = 2  n = 1 in four dimensions are
derived by coupling the n = 2 massless gravitino multiplet to n = 2 supergravity
in ve dimensions and performing a generalized dimensional reduction on s1/z2
with the scherk-schwarz mechanism. these theories agree with results that were
previously derived from four dimensions.

1 introduction

most supersymmetry phenomenology is based on the minimal supersymmetric standard
model, which is assumed to be the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory like
string theory or m-theory. those fundamental theories are formulated in higher space-
time dimensions and possess an extended number of supersymmetries which have to be
spontaneously broken to arrive at a phenomenologically viable n = 1 model in four dimen-
sions. hence dimensional reduction and partial supersymmetry breaking are both present
in this scenario. a technical tool that satises both features simultaneously is provided by
the scherk-schwarz mechanism [1] (also called generalized dimensional reduction), where
nontrivial boundary conditions for the elds along the compactied dimensions can lead
to spontaneously broken gauge and space-time symmetries.
in this paper the simplest
setup to investigate partial supersymmetry breaking by generalized dimensional reduc-
tion is used, namely the partial breaking of n = 2  n = 1 in four dimensions coming
from a theory in ve dimensions. the focus is on the superhiggs eect, where gold-
stone fermions from the broken supersymmetries become the longitudinal components of
massive gravitinos.

the physics that underlies this superhiggs eect for the spontaneous breaking of
n = 2 supersymmetry to n = 1 was investigated in a at minkowski background [2]
as well as in an anti-de sitter (ads) background [3], where theories were constructed
that describe partial supersymmetry breaking in a model-independent approach with a
minimal eld content motivated by the superhiggs eect. in this paper these theories of
partial n = 2  n = 1 supersymmetry breaking in four dimensions will be reproduced
by compactifying the massless n = 2 d = 5 massless gravitino multiplet1 on the orbifold
s1/z2 and using the scherk-schwarz mechanism [1] to introduce a symmetry-breaking
mass parameter. in order to exhibit the superhiggs eect, this procedure must be carried
out in a supergravity background.

this derivation serves several purposes: the starting point of the investigation is the
massless n = 2 d = 5 gravitino multiplet noether-coupled to n = 2 d = 5 supergravity
which leads to pure n = 4 d = 5 supergravity (without matter). this is a rather
simple theory that allows for easy extensions such as embedding into a higher n theory
or introducing matter couplings. second, the theories obtained from ve dimensions are
already out of unitary gauge, so that the symmetry breaking mass parameter m can be
set to zero with impunity. in particular, no singular stuckelberg redenitions (containing
1/m-terms as in ref. [2]) are required.

what other motivation apart from simplicity is there to look at a theory in ve di-
mensions? partial supersymmetry breaking leads to massive n = 1 multiplets in four
dimensions (e. g. the gravitino multiplet), whose states can be classied in terms of the
usp(2) subgroup of the maximal automorphism group so(4). usp(2) is also the au-
tomorphism group of the lowest, n = 2, massless superalgebra in ve dimensions.
it
also seems natural to derive a massive 4-dimensional theory from a massless theory in
ve dimensions, because the degrees of freedom of a massless d = 5 vector eld (3)
and the degrees of freedom of a massless symplectic d = 5 majorana spinor (4) match

1 here, n = 2 refers to the lowest supersymmetry in ve dimensions, corresponding to two symplectic

majorana spinors, which are equivalent to one dirac spinor.

those of their massive counterparts in d = 4. this transition can be easily implemented
by a scherk-schwarz compactication on s1, where it can be seen that the fth compo-
nents of a symplectic gravitino i
 4 and a 4, provide the
longitudinal components of the massive 4-dimensional elds i

m and a complex vector am , i

m and am.2

a natural candidate for partial supersymmetry breaking in four dimensions eected by
scherk-schwarz compactication on s1 would be pure n = 2 d = 5 supergravity [4, 5],
in particular since the degrees of freedom exactly match those of one of the minimal cases
(with two vectors) considered in ref.
[2]. unfortunately, scherk-schwarz compactica-
tion applied to this theory breaks both supersymmetries.
in fact, any scherk-schwarz
compactication of n-extended supergravity on s1 breaks an even number of supersym-
metries, since the scherk-schwarz generator must be a generator of usp(n) [6]. this
can be circumvented by projecting out half of the states by compactifying on the orbifold
s1/z2. in this paper, the length of the interval s1/z2 is assumed to be of the order of
the planck length; hence only the massless kaluza-klein modes (possibly lifted by the
scherk-schwarz mass parameter) are retained.

the outline of the paper is as follows: in the second section the massless n = 2
d = 5 gravitino multiplet will be compactied on s1/z2, yielding a massive n = 1
gravitino multiplet in four dimensions together with a spontaneously broken fermionic
gauge symmetry.
in the third section, the massless n = 2 d = 5 gravitino multiplet
will be noether-coupled to n = 2 d = 5 supergravity thus yielding n = 4 supergravity
before the dimensional reduction is carried out. the corresponding 4-dimensional theory
is shown to coincide with theories exhibiting partial supersymmetry breaking which were
derived from four dimensions [7, 8, 9].3

2 generalized compactication of the massless n = 2

d = 5 gravitino multiplet

the massless n = 2 d = 5 gravitino multiplet contains two symplectic majorana graviti-
nos im , two symplectic majorana spinors i and four real vector elds. its lagrangian
and supersymmetry transformations can be conveniently obtained by truncation of the
n = 4 d = 5 supergravity constructed in ref. [13]. the conventions for the 5-dimensional
dirac algebra and the symplectic geometry are presented in the appendix.

the ve abelian vector elds aij

m i, j  {1, ..., 4} in the 5-dimensional representation
of usp(4) which are part of the spectrum of n = 4 d = 5 supergravity satisfy the reality

2in this paper, i, j... denote symplectic indices, m, n ... are 5-dimensional world indices and m, n...
are 4-dimensional world indices. a dotted numerical index stands for a world index, to be distinguished
from undotted lorentz indices.

3the geometric construction of [9] could be generalized to accommodate an arbitrary n = 2 matter
and gauge content [10] and to give masses to light mirror fermions [11]. string models exhibiting the
mass spectrum of partially broken supersymmetry were constructed in refs. [12].

therefore, 1 can also be interpreted as the goldstino for this broken symmetry.

(8)

where the dots stand for contributions from interaction terms. so all four real vectors of
the massless n = 2 gravitino multiplet can be dualized and then dimensionally reduced
to four dimensions. the implementation of the scherk-schwarz mechanism on s1/z2
requires that elds of the same index structure come in pairs, so that one of them can
be projected out by the z2 reection whereas the other becomes a massive eld in the
4-dimensional theory. if both bm and cm are dualized, the eld strength fm n
a is simply
replaced by its dual in the lagrangian and the supersymmetry transformations and the
automorphism group decomposes as before as usp(4)  su(2)  su(2).
the other possibility is the dualization of only two vectors, which must be the real or
imaginary parts of the vectors bm = br
m . otherwise, either
the complex vector or the complex antisymmetric tensor are completely projected out.
here, the imaginary parts are chosen to be dualized: bi

the dual case, the vector c i
m4 becomes the goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken
gauge symmetry mediated by the antisymmetric tensor bi
mn. this is the dual higgs
mechanism investigated in ref. [16]. as before, the 5-dimensional theory has a fermionic
gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken upon generalized dimensional reduction
(7). the generalized dimensional reduction of the massless gravitino multiplet with four
antisymmetric tensors is analogous to the case illustrated above and will not be presented
here.

these 4-dimensional theories correspond exactly, up to eld relabelings, to the dual
versions of the massive n = 1 gravitino multiplet (out of unitary gauge) before being
coupled to gravity [2]. in order to exhibit the superhiggs eect for partial supersymme-
try breaking, the above multiplets must be coupled to gravity and the fermionic gauge
symmetry must be promoted to a local supersymmetry. this will be addressed in the
next section.

3 generalized dimensional reduction of pure n = 4

d = 5 supergravity

the complete theory of partially broken supergravity in four dimensions to all orders in
the elds should now be obtainable by noether-coupling the massless gravitino multiplet
to pure n = 2 d = 5 supergravity [4, 5, 17] and performing a generalized dimensional
reduction. since consistency requires that the fermionic gauge symmetries of the massless
gravitinos become local supersymmetries, the resulting theory must be n = 4 supersym-
metric. therefore, the scherk-schwarz mechanism should be applied to n = 4 d = 5
supergravity. the pure ve-dimensional n = 4 supergravity was shown to be derivable
as a consistent truncation of the maximal n = 8 supergravity [4]. the explicit form of
the n = 4 supergravity lagrangian and its supersymmetry transformations was given in
ref. [13].

for the sake of clarity representative parts of the result of [13] are reproduced5. n =
4 supergravity has a usp(4) symmetry inherited from the automorphism group of the
supersymmetry algebra and its eld content together with a consistent parity assignment
for inversion of the fth co-ordinate is given in tables 4 and 5. the lagrangian is given

5here, the vector in the singlet representation of u sp(4), b, from ref. [13] has been renamed to gm
and the vector elds in the 5-dimensional representation of u sp(4) are parametrized as in (1). also,
the 5-dimensional spinors i have been renamed to i. the following redenitions were performed:
a  ia, am ij  1/2am ij, and i  2i.

consistent noether-coupling of the gravitino multiplet to n = 2 supergravity necessitates
the inclusion of a vector multiplet with elds (1, 2, , am, a 4).

from the parities in tables 4 and 5 it is clear that the four dimensional theory contains
in addition to the elds of n = 2 d = 4 supergravity and the massive n = 1 gravitino
multiplet out of unitary gauge [2] two chiral multiplets (2, 2
4, p, g 4, , a 4) where ep =
e4
4. this is the eld content of one vector- and one hyper-multiplet coupled to n = 2
supergravity.

the rest of this section is now devoted to showing that a generalized dimensional
reduction of n = 4 d = 5 supergravity on s1/z2 with appropriately chosen usp(4)-
generator for the scherk-schwarz mechanism indeed leads to partially broken n = 2
supergravity in four dimensions. first, those usp(4)-generators which satisfy the condi-
tion (4) with z2 = diag(1,1,1, 1) i4 must be singled out. out of tr r  {1, ..., 10}
(see appendix), the generators ts with s  {1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10} satisfy (4).

it is obvious that the fth component i 4 of the gravitinos can pick up a constant shift
 m. with the redenition (5) the corresponding 4-dimensional gravitino im will also
pick up a shift, thus identifying the broken supersymmetries.
the choice ts with s  {8, 10} would break all supersymmetries. in order to match

from the lagrangian (15) and the supersymmetry transformations (16) it is obvious
that 2
m is the gauge eld for the spontaneously broken supersymmetry, whereas a linear
combination of 1 and 1 is the associated goldstino. its supersymmetric partner, the
scalar 1 + i2 is the goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken central charge gauged by
the vector am. that can be seen from the closure of the rst and second supersymmetry
algebra on 1 + i2 and am [2].
this result should be compared to partially broken 4-dimensional n = 2 supergravities
with complete n = 2 multiplets constructed in refs.
[7, 8, 9]. albeit equivalent up to
eld redenitions, the non-singular parametrization of the scalar elds in ref. [8] is closest
to the parametrization of the scalars as obtained by the above-described dimensional
reduction, so the eld labels from [8] are used in table 6. in ref. [8] the breaking of the
ith supersymmetry is parametrized by the quantities i, i  {1, 2}. in this context, the

second supersymmetry is chosen to be broken, so 1 = 0 and 2 = m. the more general
supersymmetry breaking scenario in ref. [8] can be obtained from ve dimensions by the
choice 1t2 + 2t5 for the scherk-schwarz generator. one nds complete agreement of
(15) and (16) up to trivial phase factors with the corresponding expressions in ref. [8].

4 conclusions

in this paper it was shown that partial supersymmetry breaking n = 2  n = 1 in
four dimensions can be easily reproduced by compactifying n = 4 d = 5 supergravity
on the orbifold s1/z2 and using the scherk-schwarz mechanism. this means that com-
pactication of n = 4 d = 5 supergravity on s1/z2 automatically leads to an n = 2
supersymmetric theory in four dimensions in which no prepotential exists for the vector
multiplet  thus allowing for partial supersymmetry breaking [9]. although the deriva-
tion of partially broken theories in four dimensions from ve dimensions is considered here
only as a convenient tool, it allows for straightforward extensions like matter couplings or
embeddings in higher-n theories in ve dimensions. this is possible because the starting
point  n = 4 d = 5 supergravity  is a linearly realized massless theory with complete
multiplets. therefore it is not surprising that complete n = 2 supermultiplets as in refs.
[7, 8, 9] persist in four dimensions in the nonlinearly realized broken phase.

the poincare dualities exploited in ref.

[2] for massless vectors and scalars in four
dimensions can now be seen to be consequences of a duality in ve dimension relating
a massless vector to a massless antisymmetric tensor. dual formulations of the theories
in refs.
[7, 8, 9] can be found by dualizing rst the goldstone scalars to antisymmetric
tensors and then dualizing the vectors according to the method described in ref.
[20].
these theories correspond to lowest order in the elds to the eective theories derived in
ref. [2].

in ref.

[3] the partial breaking of extended supersymmetry in four dimensions with
a minimal eld content as dictated by the superhiggs eect was extended to an anti-de

11

sitter background. there it was found that only one of the two goldstone scalars in the
theory out of unitary gauge could be dualized to an antisymmetric tensor, the other one
could not be dualized because it occurred in the theory without derivatives acting upon
it. if one were to derive this theory by a compactication ads5  ads4  s1/z2, the
resulting 4-dimensional theory would as well contain one vector and one antisymmetric
tensor, since the bosonic group structure of the n = 4 ads5 automorphism group requires
two of the ve vectors, which reside in the 5-dimensional representation of usp(4) in a
minkowski background, to be replaced by antisymmetric tensors [21]. the gauge group
then becomes su(2)  u(1) and the z2 reection would project out two of the vectors in
su(2) and one antisymmetric tensor in u(1). work along these lines is in progress.
