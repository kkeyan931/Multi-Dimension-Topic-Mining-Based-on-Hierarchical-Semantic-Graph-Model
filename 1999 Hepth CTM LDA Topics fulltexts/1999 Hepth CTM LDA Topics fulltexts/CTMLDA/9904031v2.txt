abstract

the qcd one-loop renormalization is restudied in a mass-dependent

subtraction scheme in which the quark mass is not set to vanish and
the renormalization point is chosen to be an arbitrary time-like mo-
mentum. the correctness of the subtraction is ensured by the ward
identities which are respected in all the processes of subtraction. by
considering the mass eect, the eective coupling constant and the
eective quark mass are given in improved expressions which are dif-
ferent from the previous results.

1.introduction

the asymptotically free property of quantum chromodynamics (qcd) has
been widely applied to analyze the scaling behaviors of high energy processes
and attracted much attention to investigate the qcd renormalization123.
this property was at rst discovered in refs.(1) and (2) from studying the

1

b = 1

one-loop renormalization and the solution of renormalization group equa-
tion (rge)2429satised by the coupling constant. the anomalous dimen-
sion ( or the -function) appearing in the equation was computed from the
renormalization constants which are ordinarily given by mass-independent
subtractions such as the minimal subtraction (ms)6, the modied minimal
subtraction7and the momentum space subtraction(mom)8 . however, there
appears a serious ambiguity problem11 that dierent subtraction schemes
give dierent results for a renormalized quantity in a nite order perturbative
calculation. in the ms schemes which is carried out in the dimensional reg-
ularization procedure, only the divergent terms proportional to the factor 1

(where  = 2 n
2 ) are subtracted. the ms scheme was demonstrated to give
the perturbative expansion in the coupling constant for a physical quantity
which is of worse convergence. to improve the convergence, the ms scheme
was proposed to subtract the divergent part of a feynman diagram which
contains the factor 1
 + ln 4   where the unphysical terms ln 4  
arise from a special way of analytical continuation of the dimension from n
to 49. the ms and ms schemes are simple and respect the ward identity,
but considered to be nonphysical8. in the mom scheme, the divergence in
a feynman integral is subtracted at an euclidean momentum, p2
i = 2.
this subtraction was viewed as physical and shown to give the perturbative
series of better convergence. nevertheless, the renormalization constants ob-
tained in this scheme do not automatically satisfy the ward identity. to solve
the ambiguity problem, several prescriptions were proposed in the past1014.
in our preceding paper on the qed renormalization33, we treated the am-
biguity problem from a dierent angle.
it was argued that a subtraction
scheme must respect necessary physical and mathematical principles shcu as
the gauge-symmetry (the ward identity), the lorentz-invariance( the energy-
momentum conservation) and the mathematical convergence. in addition, it
was proved that the solution of the renormalization group equation (rge)
for a renormalized quantity (for example, a wave function, a propagator or a
vertex) can be uniquely determined by applying the renormalization boudary
condition without any ambiguity. as a result, an exact s-matrix element can
be expressed in the form as given in the tree-diagram approximation ex-
cept that the coupling constant, the fermion mass and the gauge parameter
become eective (running )ones. therefore the tesk of renormalization is
reduced to nd these eective quantities.

in the mass-independent subtractions mentioned before, the fermion mass

2

is set to be zero, or say, only the massless fermion propagator 1
6p is used in
the calculation of divergent feynman diagrams. the rationality of the mass-
independent subtraction was argued as follows6,29. in the conventional per-
turbation series which is expanded in coupling constant, the massive fermion
propagator can be expanded as such a series

substitution of this series into the coventional perturbation series leads to a
new perturbation series in which the fermion propagator becomes massless
and the fermion mass, like the coupling constant, can be treated as another
expansion parameter. working with this kind of perturbation series, one may
perform the mass-independent subtraction. it is obvious that in order to ob-
tain a quantity which is of a certain order of coupling constant in the sense of
the conventional perturbation theory, according to eq.(1.1), one has to com-
pute an innite set of perturbative terms in the new perturbation theory. in
the large momentum limit, the massive propagator is reduced to the massless
one. in this case, there will be no dierence between the both perturbation
theories mentioned above. however, for a process whose energy is not too
high, particularly, in the energy region near the meson production threshold,
the mass in the fermion propagator can not be negligible. in this case, to see
the eect of fermion mass on the renormalization , it is convenient to carry
out a mass-dependent renormalization in the framework of the conventional
perturbation theory as was done in the previous literature3,10. obviously,
the mom scheme is suitable for this kind of renormalization. in ref.(3), the
subtraction was carried out at an arbitrary euclidean point, p2
i = 2 and
in the landau gauge. while, in ref.(10), the renormalization was done at an
i = 2 and in the feynman gauge. both of the
o mass shell point, p2
subtractions give the same one-loop anomalous dimension of the coupling
constant, but dierent anomalous dimensions of the quark mass.

i  m2

in this paper, we wish to restudy the qcd mass-dependent renormaliza-
tion in the mom scheme along the line as described in our preceding paper.
the new features of this study are: (1) the subtraction exactly respects
necessary physical and mathematical principles. owing to the restriction of
these principles, the renormalization will be put on the faithful basis and
have no ambiguity. for example, by the convergence principle, we are not
allowed to employ the divergent form of renormalization constants to do a

3

meaningful calculation because a divergent quantity is not well-dened math-
ematically and therefore can not be unambiguously evaluated by any compu-
tational rule. the correct procedure of computing the anomalous dimension
in a rge is usage of regularized froms of the renormalization constants.
by this procedure, a renormalized quantity given by solving its rge will
be uniquely determined by its anomalous dimension and boundary condi-
tion; (2) the renormalization point is taken to be a time-like (minkowski)
momentum. the subtraction with this renormalization point will be called
generalized mass-shell scheme(gms) because this scheme can naturally lead
to the results given in the mass-shell subtraction scheme. it will be shown
that the behavior of a renormalized quantity derived in the gms scheme is
dierent from the ones obtained in other subtraction schemes; (3) the qcd
one-loop eective coupling constant and eective quark masses derived in the
gms scheme and in general gauges are given rigorous and explicit expres-
sions. these expressions will go over to the results given in the ms scheme
in the large momentum limit.

the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows.

in sect.2, we will
describe the derivation of the renormalization constant of coupling constant.
this renormalization constant is chosen to be determined by the renormal-
ization constants of the gluon propagator, the ghost particle propagator and
the ghost vertices. the renormalization constant of gluon propagator is given
based on the ward identity. it will be shown that the other two renormaliza-
tion constants for the ghost particle propagator and the ghost vertex will give
their anomalous dimensions which are renormalization-scheme-independent.
in sect.3, we will derive an explicit expression of the eective coupling con-
stant by solving its rge and show its asymptotic behavior. in sect.4, we
will give a derivation of the ward identity satised by the quark-gluon vertex
and prove that in the approximation of order g2, this identity is reduced to
the form as found in qed and thus the subtraction version of the quark self-
energy is similar to that for the electron self-energy. in sect.5, an explicit
expression of eective quark masses will be given by solving its rge. we
will end this paper with some comments and discussions.

2. the renomalization constant of coupling
constant

the renormalization constant of coupling constant zg is dened by

g = zggr

(2. 1)

where gr and g denote the renormalized and unrenormalized coupling con-
stants respectively. according to the ward identity30, the zg can be ex-
pressed in dierent ways.
in this section, we prefer to use the following
expression

zg = ez1
ez3z

2
3

(2. 2)

where z3, ez3 and ez1 are the renormalization constants for the gluon prop-

agator, the ghost particle propagator and ghost vertex respectively. in the
following, we will describe how they are determined by the subtractions of
the gluon self-energy, the ghost particle self-energy and the ghost vertex cor-
rection in the gms scheme. the one-loop diagrams for the gluon self-energy,
the ghost particle self-energy and the ghost vertex correction have already
been calculated in the literature8,31,32 by the dimensional regularization . so,
we may directly quote the results and put some emphases on essential points
of the subtraction procedure in the gms scheme.

the renormalization constant z3 is, in the gms scheme, dened by

z 1

3 = 1 + (2)

(2. 3)

where (k2) is the gluon self-energy appearing in the transverse part of gluon
propagator

idab

(k) = iab
k2 + i

[(g

1 + (k2)

a correct way of calculating the function (k2) is to use the relation

(k2) =

1
3k2 g(k)

(2. 4)

(2. 5)

where (k) is the radiative correction tensor which is transverse, (k) =
(k2g  kk)(k2), as implied by the ward identity k(k) = 0. for

5

the one-loop gluon self-energy diagrams as depicted in figs.(1a)-(1c), after
computing the (k2) by the dimensional regularization procedure and then
setting k2 = 2, one can get the regularized form of the z3 as follows

and mi is the mass of i-th quark, while, m is an arbitrary mass introduced
to make the coupling constant g dimensionless in the n-dimensional space.

the constant ez3 is, in the gms scheme, dened as

(2. 10)

where (q2) is the self-energy of ghost particle which appears in the ghost
particle propagator

iab(q) =

iab

q2[1 + (q2)] + i

(2. 11)

for the one-loop diagram shown in fig.(1e), the regularized form of the ez3 is

easily obtained by the dimensional regularization as shown in the following

now, let us turn to discuss the subtraction of the ghost vertex. the vertex

is generally represented as

 (p, q) = gf abc[p + (p, q)]
abc

(2. 13)

where (p, q) denotes the higher order corrections. according to the lorentz
covariance, it may be written in the form

(p, q) = a(p2, q2, p  q)p + b(p2, q2, p  q)q

(2. 14)

where a and b are the scalar functions. suppose only the function a is
divergent in the limit   0, while the b is nite as we encountered in the
one-loop approximation. in this case, we may only subtract the divergent
part in the a at the point p2 = q2 = 2. alternatively, it is more convenient to
choose the renormalization point such that p=q and p2 = 2 which implies
r2 = (p  q)2 = 0. this choice is compatible with the energy-momentum
conservation and yields

with the subtraction in eq.(2.15) and the denition

(2. 16)

(2. 17)

(2. 18)

(2. 19)

r(p, q) = gf abc[p + r(p, q)]

which is the renormalized vertex. the latter vertex satises the boundary
condition

r(p, q) |p=q,p2=2= gf abcp
abc

(2. 20)

which is the bare vertex, showing the advantage of the subtraction chosen.
for the one-loop diagrams depicted in figs.(1f) and (1g), according to the

7

denition in eqs.(2.15) and (2.16) and through tedious calculations, we nd
in the n-dimensional space

(2. 21)

el = el1 + el2

where el1 and el2 are given by diagrams in figs.(1h) and (1i) respectively.

where the symbolfts represents the terms which are nite in the limit
  0. these terms are not necessary to be written explicitly for our purpose
because they are independent of the renormalization point  and therefore
give no contributions to the anomalous dimension. in the approximation of

order g2, considering eq.(2.21), the ez1 dened in eq.(2.17) can be written

as

(2. 24)

ez1 = 1  el1  el2

3.eective coupling constant

the eective coupling constant is determined by the following rge

gr() + g()gr() = 0

there are three points we would like to stress here. (1) the results given in
eqs.(3.4) and (3.5) are exactly identical to those obtained in the ms scheme.
this is because in the one-loop diagrams of the ghost particle self-energy

and the ghost vertex, only the massless particles are involved. so, the e1 and
e3 given above are scheme-independent. this is why we like to choose the
ghost particle self-energy and the ghost vertex to dene the renormalization
constant zg . as for the 3, it is noted that the term related to the j2(x)
in eq.(2.6) which is nite in the limit  0 gives no contribution to the
anomalous dimension owing to its independence of the fermion mass. when
the quark mass is set to be zero, the result in eq.(3.3) will be reduced to
that given in the ms scheme. in this case, the 3 is only given by the terms
in eq.(2.6) which contain the -pole. (2) each of the quark bare masses in
eq.(3.3) has been replaced by its renormalized one which is taken to be a con-
stant and identied with the pole of the quark propagator. the replacement
is suitable only in the lowest order approximation. at one-loop level, we con-
cern the anomalous dimension of the order of g2, therefore, the quark mass
in eq.(3.3) is only needed to be given in the lowest order. (3) the renormal-
ization point may be parametrized by a scale variable ,  = 0 where 0

9

is a xed scale parameter which may be chosen from physical consideration.
the  can also be chosen to be the scale variable for momenta, p = p0.
with the  introduced, we may write i = ci
. noticing this
relation, on inserting eqs.(3.3)-(3.5) into eq.(3.2), the anomalous dimension
g will be represented in the following

this just is the result obtained previously in the ms scheme1,2. the behavior
of the eective coupling constants are represented in figs.(2) and (3). the
coupling constants in fig.(2) are given by taking all the quark masses to
be equal and nf = 4. the solid curve represents the coupling constant
evaluated by using eqs.(3.10), (3.18) and (3.19). fig.(3) shows some coupling
constants for dierent numbers of avor and unequal masses. in the gure,
the constituent quark masses are taken to be mu = md = 0.3gev, ms =
0.45gev, mc = 1.5gev, mb = 5.0gev and mt = 175gev , and the scale 0
is taken to be equal to the nf -th quark mass. from figs.(2) and (3), one
can see that all the r() decrease with the increase of  and tend to zero
when   , exhibiting the well-known asymptotically free property. in the
region near  = 1, there is a maximum for each curve. the height and the
position of the maximum weakly depend on the number of avor(see fig.(3)).
in comparison with the result given in the ms scheme, as we see from fig.(2),
the quark mass gives a considerable improvement on the eective interaction,
particularly, in the region near the heavier meson threshold. however, as
shown in figs.(2) and (3). when   0, all the r() drastically fall down
to zero from their maxima. this unreasonable result indicates that the qcd
perturbation theory is inapplicable in the very small momentum domain.

4.the ward identity for quark-gluon vertex

the aim of this section is to sketch the derivation of the ward identity
satised by the quark-gluon vertex and to show how we should do for the
subtraction of the quark self-energy. the ward identity is not dicult to
derive from the qcd generating functional. firstly, we write the ward
identity obeyed by the quark-gluon three point green function32

this just is the ward identity satised by the quark-gluon vertex32. consider-
ing the energy-momentum conservation and introducing new vertex functions

a(p, q, k) = (2)44(p  q  k)[1 + (k2)]a(p, q)
a(p, q, k) = (2)44(p  q  k)[1 + (k2)]a(p, q)

the identity in eq.(4.10) can be represented in the form

(p  q)a

(p, q) = s1

f (p)a(p, q)  a(p, q)s1

f (q)

(4. 11)

(4. 12)

(4. 13)

(4. 14)

in the lowest order approximation, the above identity is clearly satised as
long as we notice



(p, q) = it a

(0)a
(0)a(p, q) = (0)a(p, q) = it a

(4. 15)

(4. 16)

the latter result may easily be derived from the denitions given in eqs.(4.4),
(4.6), (4.8), (4.9), (4.12) and (4.13) by using the lowest order expression

ab(x, y, z, u)  is0

f (x  y)10

ab(z  u)1

(4. 17)

now, we are interested in the one-loop approximation of order g2.

in
this approximation, the quark-gluon vertex denoted by (1)a
(p, q) is con-
tributed from the two diagrams in figs.(1h) and (1i) whose expressions are



14

well known. the quark-ghost vertex functions a(p, q) and a(p, q) evaluated
from figs.(1j) and (1k) are shown in the following.

(1)a(p, q) = it ai(p, q)

(4. 19)

(4. 20)

(4. 21)

it is clear that the above functions are logarithmically divergent. thus, up
to the order g2, we can write

(1)a



(p, q) = it a[ + (1)

 (p, q)]

(4. 22)

where we have set a

(p, q) = it a(1)

 (p, q),

and

a(p, q) = it a[1 + i(p, q)]

a(p, q) = it a[1 + i(p, q)]

(4. 23)

(4. 24)

upon dierentiating the both sides of eq.(4.14) with respect to p, set-
ting q=p and substituting the expression of the inverse of quark propagator

in the order of g2, we get

s1
f (p) = 6 p  m  (p)

(p, p) =

q=p(6 p  m)

(4. 27)

it is emphasized that at one-loop level, the both sides of eq.(4.26) are of the
order of g2. in the derivation of eq.(4.26) from eq.(4.14), the terms higher
than the order g2 have been neglected. the identity in eq.(4.26) formally is
the same as we met in qed. the vertex (p, p) may be expressed in the
form

where l is a divergent constant dened by

(p, p)= l + c

(p)

l = (p, p)|6p=

(4. 28)

(4. 29)

and c

(p) is the nite part of (p, p) satisfying the boundary condition

c
(p) |6p== 0

(4. 30)

integrating the identity in eq.(4.26) over the momentum p and considering
the expression in eq.(4.28), we have

(p) = a + (6 p  )[b  c(p2)]

(4. 31)

where a and b are the divergent constants depending on the renormalization
point  which are dened as

a = ()

b = l
and c(p2) is a nite function dened by

z p

p

(p) = (6 p  )c(p2)

with boundary condition

c(p2) = 0

(4. 32)

(4. 33)

(4. 34)

(4. 35)

clearly, the expression in eq.(4.31) gives a subtraction version for the fermion
self-energy which is required by the ward identity and correct at least in the
approximation of the order g2. with this subtraction, the quark propagator
will be renormalized as follows

sf (p) =

z2

6 p  mr  r(p)

(4. 36)

where z2, mr and r(p) are the quark propagator renormalization constant,
the renormalized quark mass and the nite correction of the self-energy re-
spectively. the z2 and the mr are respectively dened as

and

z 1
2 = 1  b

mr = z 1

m m

(4. 37)

(4. 38)

where zm is the quark mass renormalization constant which is dened by the
following expression

z 1
m = 1 + z2[am1 + (1  m1)b]

(4. 39)

5.eective quark mass

taking the derivative of eq.(4.38) with respect to  and noticing  d

the behavior of eective masses is illustrated in fig.(4). the results in
fig.(4) are given by taking nf = 4 and all the quark masses to be equal.
the solid curve and the dashed one represent the eective masses calculated
respectively by taking the coupling constant to be the running one and a xed
value r = 0.2. the common feature of these eective masses is as follows.
for each curve, there is a maximum at   1.54. when  tends to innity,
the masses fall down to zero, exhibiting the well-known asymptotically free
behavior. for the  lying in the region [0,1), the mass is less than the
maximum and behaves almost as a constant. however, in the region of 
near zero, as pointed out in sect.3, the qcd perturbative results are no
longer valid.

6.comments and conclusions

in this paper, the qcd one-loop renormalization has been restudied in
the gms scheme. it was shown that the gms scheme allows us not only to
consider the mass eect on the renormalization, but also to directly relate the
renormalization scale  to the momentum p. the eective coupling constant
and the eective quark masses obtained in this scheme get a noteworthy im-
provement near the heavy quark threshold in comparison with those given
previously in the ms scheme. the eective coupling constant and the ef-
fective quark mass presented in the ms scheme now appear as approximate
results given in the large momentum limit.
it is noted here that even in
this limit, the eective coupling constant and the eective mass can only
have unique forms. it is impossible to result in a dierence between the ms
and ms schemes7,8,16 because an eective quantity should be the solution
of its rge whose form is uniquely determined by the anomalous dimension

20

and the boundary condition. as emphasized before, the correct procedure
of evaluating the anomalous dimension is the use of the regularized renor-
malization constant and the limit   0 should be taken after dierentiation
with respect to the renormalization point. by this procedure, the factor
(4m)(1 + ) appearing in the n-dimensional feynman integrals can only
come to unity. it is not possible to yield the unphysical terms ln 4   in a
renormalized quantity.
in this paper, the eective coupling constant given in the one-loop ap-
proximation is calculated by employing the renormalization constants given
by the subtractions of the gluon and ghost particle self-energies and the ghost
vertex correction. it is emphasized that the renormalization constant z2 is
obtained on the basis of the ward identity obeyed by the gluon self-energy

and therefore is faithful. the renormalization constants ez1 and ez3 derived

respectively from the subtractions of the ghost vertex correction and the
ghost particle self-energy, as mentioned in sect.4, give the anomalous dimen-
sions which are scheme-independent due to that there is no quark mass to
appear in the vertex and the self-energy. therefore, the anomalous dimen-
sion g computed from these renormalization constants is denite, no any
uncertainty. particularly, the correctness of the anomalous dimension shown
in eqs.(3.6)-(3.8) is conrmed by the previous result presented in refs.(9)
and (16) where the g was determined by the subtraction of the quark and
gluon self-energies and the quark-gluon vertex at a space-like point. the
expression of the -function given in the space-like point is 3,10

directly written out from eqs.(3.6)- (3.8) by the transformation c2
i ,
corresponding to 2  2. the eective coupling constant given by the -
function in eq.(6.1) still exhibits the property of asymptotic freedom when
  ; but, it has a landau singularity in the region of large distance,
dierent from the result given in the gms scheme. in fig.(2), the landau
singularity occurs at   0.4.

21

it is stressed again that the eective quark masses shown in sect.5 are
obtained based on the subtraction written in eq.(4.31) which is derived from
the ward identity respected by the quark one-loop self-energy. these eective
masses are dierent from those given in the previous works3,10. for example,
in ref.(3), the mass anomalous dimensions derived in the landau gauge is
of the form

22 [1

2

which is manifestly dierent from that formulated in eqs.(5.8) and (5.10).
the result shown above , actually, was obtained from another subtraction.
if we start from the expression for the quark self-energy29

(6. 3)
and subtract at the space-like point p2 = 2, the quark propagator and
mass renormalization constants will be dened by

(p) = a(p2)p + b(p2)m

z 1
2 = 1  a(2)

(6. 4)

and

z 1
m = z2[1 + b(2)]

(6. 5)
in the approximation of order g2 for the one-loop diagram, the constant zm
dened in eq.(6.5) will give rise to the result in eq.(6.2). since the sub-
traction above is not compatible with the ward identity, the eective quark
masses obtained in this subtraction can not be viewed as reasonable results.
the correct result of the eective quark mass given by the subtraction at
space-like may be obtained from eqs.(5.11)-(5.15) through the transforma-
tion   i. in this case, as we see, the eective mass becomes complex. if
we require the eective mass to be real, the subtraction at space-like point
should be excluded. however, this does not mean that the space-like momen-
tum subtraction is useless. the subtractions at time-like point and at space-
like point probably suit to dierent processes in which the interactions are of
dierent behaviors. for example, for the t- channel fermion-antifermion scat-
tering, the momentum on the intermediate boson line is space-like; while, for
the s-channel scattering, the corresponding momentum is time-like. it seems
that the boson self-energy should be subtracted at the space-like point for
the former process and at time-like point for the latter process. this problem
is, we think, worthy to pursue in future investigations.
