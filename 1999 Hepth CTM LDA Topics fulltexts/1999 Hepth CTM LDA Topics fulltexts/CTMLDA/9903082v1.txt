abstract

we consider the two-dimensional dilute q-state potts model on its rst order phase
transition surface for 0 < q  4. after determining the exact scattering theory which
describes the scaling limit, we compute the two-kink form factors of the dilution,

thermal and spin operators. they provide an approximation for the correlation

functions whose accuracy is illustrated by evaluating the central charge and the

scaling dimensions along the tricritical line.

1 introduction

two-dimensional quantum eld theory allows for a large class of non-scale-invariant mod-

els which exhibit an innite number of integrals of motion [1]. these models are integrable,

in the sense that the s-matrix which determine their on-shell physics in 1 + 1 dimensions

can be computed exactly [2]. the solvability of the models extends o-shell through the

possibility of exact determination of the matrix elements of local operators on the asymp-

totic states [3, 4], which in turn leads to the evaluation of correlation functions in the

form of spectral series.

a natural domain of application for quantum eld theory is provided by the scaling

limit of classical statistical mechanics.

it is well known that in two dimensions there

exists a number of lattice models which are exactly solvable due to the presence of a

family of commuting transfer matrices [5]. the scaling limit of these models is described

by an integrable eld theory. what is more interesting is that the opposite appears to be

not true, a circumstance which attests of an inequivalence of the notions of integrability

on the lattice and in the continous limit.

in fact, there are integrable quantum eld

theories which describe the scaling limit of statistical models which are not solved on the

lattice. for these models, integrability seems to emerge as a property of the scaling limit,

after that the non-universal, lattice dependent features have been eliminated. among the

examples of this kind which have been studied in more detail, we mention the ising model
in a magnetic eld at t = tc [1, 6, 7], the o-critical q-state potts model with 0 < q  4
[8, 9], and the o-critical ashkin-teller model [10].

in this paper we are interested in the generalisation of the q-state potts model which

allows for the presence of annealed vacancies on the lattice [11]. more precisely, we will
consider the model on its rst order transition surface for q  4. the model is not
solvable on the lattice but is integrable in the scaling limit because it corresponds to
the perturbation of the conformal eld theories with c  1 by the primary operator
1,3 [13]. the 1,3-perturbed conformal eld theories have done the object of extensive
study. in particular, they are known to describe the scaling limit of the rsos models
[14, 15] and the o(n) model for 2 < n < 2 [12, 13]. the exact scattering descriptions
corresponding to the massive phases of these models were found in refs. [16, 17] and [18],

respectively. here we will directly determine the s-matrix which is suitable for the potts

model interpretation by requiring that it describes a system in which a disordered phase

coexists with q ordered phases which are exchanged by permutation symmetry. the cases

q = 2, 3 were already discussed in ref. [19].

2

working within the particle basis which makes explicit the relevant symmetries of the

model is important for dealing with the problem of the determination of the matrix ele-

ments of local operators on the asymptotic particle states (form factors). the knowledge

of the form factors determines the correlation functions in the form of spectral series.

these series, however, are non-trivial mathematical objects for which no resummation

technique is presently available. for this reason, it becomes important to be able to judge

of the level of accuracy yielded by partial sums. a particularly interesting test is provided

by the sum rules which express the ultravioled data (central charge and scaling dimen-

sions) as integrals of correlation functions computed in the o-critical theory [20, 21]. the

general response is that the rate of convergence of the spectral series is remarkably fast.

the results of this paper provide, in particular, an illustration of this fact. of course,

the agreement with the predictions of conformal eld theory for the ultraviolet limit also

represents a non-trivial conrmation of the correctness of the proposed scattering theory.

the layout of the paper is the following.

in the next section we recall some basic

features of the dilute potts model before turning to the determination of the s-matrix in

section 3. the exact scattering description is then used in section 4 to compute the form

factors of the dilution, thermal and spin operators. section 5 deals with the correlation

functions of these operators and the sum rules for the central charge and the scaling

dimensions; correlation lengths and interfacial tensions are also discussed. few nal

remarks are collected in section 6.

2 the dilute potts model

the dilute q-state potts model is dened by the lattice hamiltonian [11]

h = j xhx,yi

t(x)t(y)s(x),s(y) + xx

t(x) .

(2.1)

here s(x) is the ordinary potts spin variable which can assume q dierent values (colours);

the system is clearly invariant under permutations of the colours. t(x) is a lattice gas

variable which equals 0 if the site x is empty or 1 if it is occupied. the coupling j > 0

(ferromagnetic case) plays the role of the inverse temperature, while  is a chemical

potential controlling the vacancy density. the pure potts model is recovered when  =
.

when writing the hamiltonian (2.1) it is natural to think of the number of colours

q as being an integer. however, it is well known that it makes sense and is extremely

3

useful to consider the analyitically continued version of the potts model in which q is a
real parameter. in the pure model, the monochromatic limit q  1 describes isotropic
percolation [22]. the dilute system simply reduces to an ising model at q = 1.

the phase diagram corresponding to the hamiltonian (2.1) in two dimensions [23] is

shown in fig. 1. the system undergoes a ferromagnetic phase transition at a critical value

of the temperature tc. it is desordered at t > tc, and exhibits spontaneous magnetisation
in the low-temperature phase in which q vacua (one for each colour) are degenerate. in
the pure model (e = 0), the phase transition is second order for q  4 and rst order for
q > 4 [5]. when the vacancy density becomes non-zero, the transition remains continous

at q < 4 up to a critical value c of the dilution, and becomes rst order for  > c.
the disordered phase coexists with the q ordered phases along the rst order transition

lines (dashed in fig. 1). the line t = tc,  = c (upper thick segment in the phase
diagram) is a line of tricritical xed points. since the transition is always discontinous

for q > 4, the tricritical line has to meet the line of xed points of the pure model (lower

thick segment) at q = 4.

let us consider the dilute q-state potts model in the framework of conformal eld

theory and its perturbations. both the critical and tricritical line of xed point are

described by conformal eld theory [13]. here we are interested in the tricritical one,

since it describes the ultraviolet limit of the rst order phase transition lines we want to

study. it corresponds to the conformal theory with central charge

with p related to q as

c = 1

p(p + 1)

,

p > 2

q = 2 cos


p

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

in the continous eld theoretic description, the dilution, thermal and spin variables are

described by operators which we denote by (x), (x) and i(x) (i = 1, 2, . . . , q), respec-
tively. they correspond to the operators 1,3, 1,2 and  p
in the conformal eld theory
classication, and their scaling dimensions along the tricritical line are

(2.5)

(2.6)

.

the renormalisation group trajectories owing out of the tricritical line at t = tc (vertical
lines in fig. 1) are described by the perturbation of the tricritical line by the dilution

4

operator (x), which is relevant (x < 2) for q < 4. the action associated to such
trajectories reads

a = atricr + gz d2x (x) ,

(2.7)

where atricr denotes the action of the tricritical line and g    c is the coupling
measuring the deviation from the critical dilution. depending on the sign of g, the

action above describes either the massless ows to the ordinary critical point (at least for
2  q < 4), or the massive trajectories associated to the rst order transition. both types
of trajectories are known to be integrable, as a consequence of the integrability of the 1,3
perturbations of conformal eld theory [1].

in this paper, we deal with the rst order trajectories along which the elementary

excitations have a mass m (inverse correlation length) related to the coupling g as

1

2x ,

m  g

q < 4 .

(2.8)

as q approaches 4 from below, the perturbation becomes marginally relevant, the cor-
relation length develops an essential singularity as g  0+, and the previous relation is
replaced by [24]

m  ea/g ,

q = 4

(2.9)

where a is a positive constant. notice that for q = 1 one has c = 1/2, x = 1 and
x = 1/8, so that the action (2.7) describes an ising model in zero magnetic eld.

3 scattering theory

in this section we determine the exact scattering theory describing the rst order transition

lines of the dilute q-state potts model (vertical dashed lines in fig. 1). in 1+1 dimensions

one knows that the elementary excitations of a theory exhibiting degenerate ferromagnetic

vacua are kinks interpolating between adjacent vacua. kink excitations dier from the

ordinary particle excitations for the fact that, in general, the composition of multi-kink

states is subject to some restrictions. both the number of elementary kinks and the type

of restrictions can be argued from an analysis of the vacuum structure.

consider the dilute potts model at t  tc. there are q ordered ground states that
we denote i, i being the colour index; they are sent into one another by the permutation
group under which the model is invariant. intuitively, one can think of them as being
located at the q vertices of a hypertetrahedron living in the (q  1)-dimensional space of
the independent spin components. the disordered vacuum (we call it 0) is located at the

5

center of the hypertetrahedron. at t < tc the energy of the disordered vacuum is higher
than that of the ordered vacua and the elementary excitations of the scattering theory
are kinks1 kij() interpolating among the ordered vacua. they can be associated to the
edges of the hypertetrahedron. this scattering theory and its o-shell consequences were

studied in refs. [8, 9] for the case of the pure potts model. on the rst order transition

surface (t = tc,  > c) the disordered vacuum becomes degenerate with the ordered
vacua and the q + 1 phases coexist. in this situation the elementary excitations are the

kinks k0i() and ki0() interpolating among the center of the hypertetrahedron and its
vertices, while the kinks we had at t < tc become composite excitations2  kij  ki0k0j.
let us x our attention on the transition surface and consider the space of states con-

structed on the elementary excitations ki0, k0i. the interpretation of kinks as excitations
interpolating among adjacent vacua requires that, in a multi-kink state, adjacent vacuum

indices belonging to dierent kinks coincide. in our case, this means that the only allowed

kink sequences are of the type

. . . k0i(1)ki0(2)k0j(3)kj0(4) . . .

.

(3.1)

the integrability of the theory ensures that the scattering of these multi-kink states is

completely elastic and factorised into the product of elementary two-body amplitudes [2].

taking into account the vacuum structure described above and the permutation symmetry

of the ordered vacua, one immediately realises that the scattering theory has only the four

two-kink amplitudes represented in fig. 2. they can be associated to the commutation

relations

k0i(1)ki0(2) = a0(1  2)k0i(2)ki0(1) + a1(1  2)xj6=i

k0j(2)kj0(1), (3.2)

ki0(1)k0j(2) = ijb0(1  2)ki0(2)k0i(1) + (1  ij)b1(1  2)ki0(2)k0j(1).(3.3)
the amplitudes are related in pairs by crossing symmetry

a0() = b0(i  ) ,
a1() = b1(i  ) .

(3.4)

they also have to satisfy the unitarity conditions which can be formally obtained by

commuting once again the r.h.s. of eqs. (3.2), (3.3)

(3.5)
1the rapidity  parameterises the on-shell energy and momentum of the kinks of mass m as (p0, p1) =

a0()a0() + (q  1)a1()a1() = 1 ,

(m cosh , m sinh ).

2in principle, ki0k0i could also form bound states corresponding to kij, but we will see that this is

not the case.

6

a0()a1() + (q  2)a1()a1() + a1()a0() = 0 ,
b0()b0() = b1()b1() = 1 .

(3.6)

(3.7)

finally, the so-called factorisation (or yang-baxter) equations are obtained by considering

a three-kink initial state and requiring the equality of the nal states obtained performing

the pair commutations (3.2), (3.3) in the two possible orderings

a0b0a0 + (q  1)a1b1a1 = b0a0b0 ,
a0b0a1 + a1b1a0 + (q  2)a1b1a1 = b1a1b0 ,
a0b1a0 + a1b0a1 + (q  2)a1b1a1 = b1a0b1 ,
a0b1a1 + a1b0a1 + a1b1a0 + (q  3)a1b1a1 = b1a1b1 ;

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

here the arguments of the three factors in each product are ,  +  and , respectively.

a solution to eqs. (3.4)(3.11) can be found along the following lines.

it is easily
seen that they x a1(0) = 0, a0(0) = b0(0) = b1(0) = 1. then, remembering also
crossing and unitarity, we know that r  b1/b0 satises r()r() = 1, r(0) = 1 and
r(i) = 0. the analysis of the cases q = 2, 3 in ref. [19] suggests the ansatz r() =
sinh (i  )/ sinh (i + ). then eq. (3.6) immediately xes 2 cos  = q or, in view
of (2.3),  = 1/p. notice that the restriction q  4 automatically emerges from the
consistency requirements of the scattering theory. this is expected since the scaling limit

of the lattice model can no longer be dened for q > 4.

having determined the ratio a1()/a0() = r(i  ), we can reduce eq. (3.5) to the

the amplitudes above satisfy the factorisation equations (3.8)(3.11). they are free of
poles in the physical strip im  (0, ) and then the theory does not possess bound
states.
it can be checked that at q = 1 the amplitudes a0 and b0 reduce to 1, as
expected for the thermal ising model3. at q = 4 the amplitudes (3.13)(3.16) become
linear combinations of those of sine-gordon solitons4 at the point  = 8 where the

term cos  which perturbs the gaussian xed point becomes marginally relevant. this

scattering theory is known to imply the relation (2.9) among the mass and the coupling

constant [26]. these checks should be sucient to to get rid of the doubts concerning the
usual cdd ambiguities5.

4 form factors

the s-matrix is not an object of primary interest for statistical mechanics. the link

with the o-shell phyics is provided by the matrix elements of the local operators on the

asymptotic particle states. they are known as form factors and are exactly computable

in integrable quantum eld theories [3, 4]. in this section we consider the matrix elements

computed on two-kink states; they are relatively easy to determine and prove sucient

to provide accurate quantitative information on the correlation functions.

we are interested in the operators (x)  (x), (x) and j(x), (x) denoting the
trace of the stress-energy tensor. they all couple to states with zero topological charge,

i.e. excitations which begin and end on the same vacuum. depending on whether the

3more precisely, we used this condition at q = 1 to x the overall sign of the s-matrix which is left

undetermined by the general equations.

4for generic values of p, the function s0() appears in the sine-gordon s-matrix. this analogy

reects the well known circumstance that 1,3-perturbed conformal eld theories are related to suitable

restrictions of the sine-gordon model [25, 17].

5for q = 2, 3, the amplitudes (3.13)(3.16) do not completely coincide with those proposed in ref. [19].

it can be checked that the innite products of gamma functions in [19], although formal solutions of all

the equations, in fact converge to zero.

5 correlation functions

in the s-matrix approach, correlation functions are expressed as spectral series over com-

plete sets of intermediate asymptotic states. the two-kink form factors we determined

above are what is needed to compute the rst non-trivial term of these series for the

operators ,  and j. depending on the phase in which correlations are computed, for
the two-point case we have

from the o-critical theory. the results obtained for c, x and x by plugging into
these sum rules the two-kink approximations (5.1), (5.2) for the correlators are shown in

figs. 4,5,6 and compared with the exact formulas; the numerical values corresponding to

integer q are given in the table. the growth of the scaling dimensions of the considered

operators with increasing q leads to more severe ultraviolet singularities of the exact cor-

relators which account for the decreasing accuracy of the two-kink approximation (which

of course cannot reproduce the singularities).

at q = 1, the two-kink computation gives exact results for c and x but not for
x. this can be understood as follows. with an obvious simplication of notation, the
2(n + 1)-kink contribution to the correlator hi|(x)(0)|ii can be written as

with the prime denoting the omission in the sum of the term with i1 = i2 = . . . = in = i.
the rst term in (5.6) involves only two vacua and at q = 1 is computed on the physical

excitations of the thermal ising model, which behave as free fermions (scattering amplitude
equal 1). as a consequence, the 2(n + 1)-kink form factors hi||ki0k0i . . . ki0k0ii
vanish at q = 1 for any n > 0. consider now the primed sum in (5.6).
it involves
qn  1 terms wich, if  is invariant under colour permutations, are all identical and
nite. therefore, we conclude that, at q = 1, (5.5) is identically zero for any n > 0

whenever  is a colour singlet operator (e.g.  = , ). the situation is more subtle
when  = i. in fact, although the number of terms in the primed sum vanishes as q  1,
now the sum contains contributions which diverge in the same limit7. in this way, the
correlator hi|(x)i(0)|iiq=1 receives a nite contribution even from excitations which
are unphysical at q = 1. this is not that surprising if one considers that the operator i
itself is unphysical at q = 1 (there are no potts spin degrees of freedom) and only makes

sense as an analytic continuation.

we conclude with two remarks concerning correlation lengths and interfacial tensions.

the true correlation lengths 0, i in the disordered and ordered phases are dened
through the large distance decay of the spin-spin correlation functions

h|i(x)i(0)|ic  e|x|/ ,

 = 0, i .

(5.7)

since this asymptotic behaviour is given by eqs. (5.1), (5.2), one immediately concludes

that

0 = i =

1
2m

.

(5.8)

in two dimensions the interfacial tension between two coexisting phases coincides with

the mass of the excitation which interpolates between them. then, denoting i0 the
ordered-disordered tension and ij (i 6= j) the ordered-ordered tension, we have

i0 =

ij
2

= m .

6 conclusion

in this paper we applied the s-matrix program to the two-dimensional dilute q-state
potts model on its rst order phase transition surface for q  4. we have shown how
integrability allows an exact scattering description of the scaling limit and how this leads

7an example of this mechanism is obtained specialising eq. (4.8) to the case  = i and recalling

eq. (4.6).

to the computation of correlation functions for the interesting operators through the form

factor approach. the sum rules for the central charge and the scaling dimensions have

been used to show the remarkable accuracy provided by the two-kink approximation for

the correlators. of course, in the same approximation, the correlation functions computed

here can be used to evaluate other universal quantities which are characteristic of the o-

critical model and are not known from conformal eld theory, for example the universal

combinations of critical amplitudes. for the pure model, this was done in ref. [9].

we have shown how the results (5.8) and (5.9) for the correlation lengths in the

dierent coexisting phases and the interfacial tensions are simple consequences of the

basic structure of the scattering theory associated to the statistical model. although
these results were obtained for q  4, there are reasons to believe that they hold true for
q > 4. as a matter of fact, in the pure system at q > 4, eq. (5.9) is known to hold [27],

and eq. (5.8) received strong support form monte carlo simulations [28].
