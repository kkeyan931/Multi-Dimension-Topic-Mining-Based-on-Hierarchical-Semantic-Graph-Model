abstract

we improve the heavy quark potential, extracted from the wilson
loop average in the ads/cft approach by taking the quantum uctu-
ation of the only radial coordinate of ads5 which is transverse to the
world-sheet of the classical nambu-goto string in the static gauge, and
obtain the universal luscher-symanzik-weisz/luscher term.

a seminal conjecture by maldacena [1] states the duality between the large n
superconformal yang-mills theory and the low energy behaviour of the superstring
theory in the anti-de sitter space back-ground. it is further shown that the cor-
relation functions of the local gauge invariant operators of n = 4 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory are related to the classical limit of the superstring partition func-
tion [2, 3]. also the vacuum expectation values of the non-local operators like wilson
loops are easily computed using this duality [4, 5]. this facilitates to extract the
heavy quark potential for susy yang-mills theories. the proposal became quite
useful after witten [6] has shown how one can break supersymmetry with non-zero
temperature. this makes a close contact with the pure qcd and as far as possible,
several qualitative behaviour of qcd in the strong coupling limit are veried [8].
in this approach the background euclidean time is compactied on a circle which is
related to the equilibrium temperature t. here one takes the space-time fermion to
be anti-periodic in this direction and then all the fermions will be as heavy as the or-
der of the temperature t. in the extreme high temperature limit fermions decouple.
thus the d+1 dimensional theory is described as a d dimensional theory without
any fermion. this gives us a d dimensional pure qcd in the zero temperature.

the heavy quark potential of the planar qcd3 is extracted from the vacuum
expectation value of the wilson loop operator [5, 7]. the space-like wilson loop
gives a linear potential which correctly signals the area law. however the luscher-
symanzik-weisz (lsw) term or commonly known as luscher term is absent from
this potential [9]. this is a universal term independent of any coupling constant
and is a characterstic of the string generated qcd potential and has been seen
and correctly estimated by lattice simulation [10]. this might cast doubt on the
supergravity approach to study planar qcd. however there are some attempts by
greensite and olesen [11] and by dorn and otto [12] to get rid of this problem.
so far there is no concrete explanation in this regard. here we claim to get this
lsw term by considering quantum uctuations of the classical solution which is an
improvement over the nambu-goto solution taken by authors of ref.
[5, 7] . we
will discuss all the points in the sequel.

here we consider the case of planar qcd3 which can be trivially extended to
higher dimension. following maldacena [4] we put heavy quark and anti-quark at
x = l/2 and x = l/2 respectively which are attached by a nambu-goto string in
an ads5  s5 black-hole background, where the metric reads

where r2 = 4gsn = q4g2

y m n , and ut = r2t . here gs is the string
coupling and n is the number of coinciding d3 branes which gives u(n) yang-mills

action in this background is

s =

2 z d dqdet(gm n xm xn ).
we look for the wilson loop which traces area in the space-like surface. the bound-
aries are accordingly x1 =  l
2 , x0 = x3 = 0 and the line where u   runs parallel
 = x1
to x2 axis. in the static gauge the world-sheet cordinates are  = x2,
and  xm = m

2 and x0 = x3 = 0. thus the action

the t   limit is the analouge of h  0 limit and thus the classical solution
is an exact solution. however luscher term is a purely quantum mechanical term
showing the nite size scaling.
in this very brief report we show here how this
classical potential is extracted and how it can be further improved to accommodate
the lsw/luscher term.

this is a linear potential v (l) = l +   where  = u 2
2r2 is the string tension. in
terms of yang-mills coupling this gives  = 2 gy mnt 3. however the subleading
term c
l is missing in the classical approximation. also c is supposed to be universal
term which does not contain any physical parameter except the nite size scale l.
this is a purely quantum eect. we take here one-loop quantum eect around the
classical solution of u as u = ucl +  where  is the quantum eld. the action in
this order is given by

to integrate over the eld  we redene

where  is a classical eld. this gives

l2 = ()2 + lmeasure,

and lmeasure is due to the redenition of the eld . also  satises

we take further dervatives with respect to  of the equation of motion (c.f. eq.(5))

to solve this linear dierential equation we substitute  = g
u  . this gives 2g = 0
and g = a + b where a and b are xed from the boundary conditions. in order
that  be well behaved at 0 and at l/2 , we x b = a (  0) and a = u (l/2)
.
the measure is now changed from d  d and the contribution of this to the

this integration can be trivially done and for large l where u  u0 the measure
just contributes a constant without changing any character of the potential. we

take the quantum uctuation  to be zero on the boundary of the wilson loop i.e.
for  = 0 and l/2. then integration over  gives the required lsw term  
12l for
the potential.

as mentioned earlier the classical action is exact in the static gauge when t 
. we just supplemented this classical action with the quantum uctuation of the
transverse cordinate u. we do not take the uctuations of the world-sheet for all
the transverse coordinate as has been shown by greensite and olesen [13]. in the
nite temperature case and the high temperature limit when dimensional reduction
is taking place, fermions completely decouple from the spectrum. since we are in
the very low energy limit of extracting the potential we feel it is legitimate not to
take any of these uctuations.

note added

this work was completed in december and was presented in the string theory
workshop at puri (9th dec- 19th dec 1998). that time i was not aware of the work
of greensite and olesen [13] and also of forste et. al. [14] where both the groups
have considered the worldsheet uctuations of both the fermionic and the bosonic
coordinates.
acknowledgements: i would like to thank the organisers and all the participants of
the puri workshop for fruitful discussions.
