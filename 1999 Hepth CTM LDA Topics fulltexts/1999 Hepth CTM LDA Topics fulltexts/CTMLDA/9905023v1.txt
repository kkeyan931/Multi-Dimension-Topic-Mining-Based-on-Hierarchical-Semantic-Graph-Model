abstract

we study an extension of the procedure to construct duality trans-
formations among abelian gauge theories to the non abelian case using
a path space formulation. we dene a pre-dual functional in path space
and introduce a particular non local map among lie algebra valued 1-
form functionals that reduces to the ordinary hodge- duality map of the
abelian theories. further, we establish a full set of equations on path space
representing the ordinary yang mills equations and bianchi identities of
non abelian gauge theories of 4-dimensional euclidean space.

introduction

duality maps between abelian gauge theories given by u (1) connections on line
bundles over a manifold x can be shown to exist by using a quantum equivalent
formulation of the original theory in terms of closed 2-forms. this formulation
was rst shown to exist for abelian and non abelian potential theories in a
particular gauge by halpern [1] and used, afterwards, for non abelian theories
in some other gauge by [2]. the construction of quantum equivalent dual abelian
theories was successfully achieved for trivial bundles in [3] using a kind of fourier
transform to the space of dual hodge- forms. in the same article, they extend
the construction to the case of non abelian gauge theories but arrived to a dual
theory with a parity violating action arising from the ambiguity in the solution
to a bianchi type constraint.

recently, the quantum equivalent dual abelian gauge theory was formulated
for non trivial bundles.
it is achieved by dening rst a functional on the
space of abelian 2-forms which must be constrained by non-local restrictions,
namely, the requeriment of being closed and with integral periods, ensuring the
existence of a 1-1 correspondence between the space of constrained 2-forms and
the line bundles over x [4].this procedure has been successfully applied even

1

to more general u(1) bundles [5] based on an extension of weils theorem to
complex p-forms [6]. once the equivalence between the formulation in terms of
the conguration space of abelian connections and that of the space of closed
2-forms is achieved, the latter is used to construct at the quantum level the dual
gauge theory, by introducing dual hodge- forms through lagrange multipliers
much in the spirit of [3], proving the existence of non trivial relations between
the partition functions of the abelian theory and its dual.

the purpose of this article is to extend the above procedure [4],[5] to the
non abelian case without the ambiguities mentioned earlier. in the rst place,
we will begin by asking what conditions should be imposed on matrix-valued
2-forms over a manifold x to produce something similar to weils theorem
for non-abelian 2-forms, so that we could achieve an equivalence between the
formulation of the theory on the conguration space of connections and the
formulation on the space of 2-forms. this actually is a formidable problem still
not solved but only to the level of conjectures [12]. in any case, we could try to
see where failures lie and propose solutions. [7]

the bianchi identity for a matrix-valued 2-form 

d  = 0

is the rst condition that comes to mind when looking for restrictions to imple-
ment, since curvatures for connections on ber bundles satisfy it. but this, in
general, does not assure even that  may be expressed locally in terms of any
1-form connection a as

 = da + a  a

something equivalent to a poincares lemma for covariantly closed forms does
not hold. moreover, even when we could express  in terms of a as above, on
open sets ui of a covering of the manifold x, compatibility of the curvature-like
2-forms (ai) and (aj) on the intersection of two open sets ui and uj should
imply that ai and aj are related by a well dened gauge transformation on the
intersection of open sets. simple calculations show that this is not the case. ai
and aj could be related by some other more general transformations that no
doubt include the mentioned gauge transformations i.e.

(ai) = g1(aj) g

not= ai = g1aj g + g1dg

this is exactly the root of the ambiguity problem in [3].

obviously, we need more restrictive conditions to arrive to the necessary
compatibility glueing for constructing globally well dened non abelian principal
bundles. in [2] this restrictive condition was partially found but at the expense
of introducing disguised path dependent gauge transformations.

on the other hand, it is well known [8], that a formulation of non abelian
gauge theories has a rather simple expression on the space of loops as a trivial
at gauge theory. the main ingredient in this formulation is the use of the

2

holonomy associated to each class of non abelian lie algebra valued connections
on a principal bundle. the use of holonomies is quite adequate since its non
local character as a geometrical object carries a lot more information about
the bundle than curvatures or connections do. so, we should go to the loop
space formulation and see whether it is possible to write some conditions that
could characterize the non abelian bundles and look for a procedure to build the
duality maps. in what follows, we suceed in proving half the task, for a more
detailed discussion see [9].

for our purpose, instead of using the space of closed curves [8, 10], we
will consider a space of open curves c [12] with xed endpoints o, p over a
smooth connected 4-dimensional euclidean manifold x with reference point o
. this will allow the construction of smoothly behaving mathematical objects
like functionals, variations of functionals, 1-form connection functionals and
so on, on open neighborhoods of the space of curves. particularly, we avoid
regularization problems in the denition of the gauge potential on loop space.

2 connections and curvatures in path space

first, any functional over this space will be denoted e(c o,p) and a variation

or increment of this functional due to a small deformation on the curve leaving
the endpoints xed is dened as

ee(c o,p)  e(c o,p + c o,p)  e(c o,p)

deformations on the curves are smooth vector elds on open neighborhoods of
x where the curve c o,p lies, tending to zero on the endpoints of the curve.
we could relax this denition allowing non zero deformations on one of the
endpoints but then we would need to impose a non linear condition to get the
compatibility requirement on the patching of the principal bundle [9].

our version of holonomy is ga, the path ordered exponential of a 1-form

connection a over x integrated over the open curve c i.e

ga(o, p, c)  exp :z p

o

a :

it becomes the ordinary holonomy when o and p are identied. it is a map
from p x to the non abelian group g.

on small deformations s. and may be expressed in terms of fp(t) , the ordinary
pointwise dened curvature 2-form associated to the connection a, as

ea(c o,p) denotes the lie algebra valued 1-form connection functional acting
ea(c o,p)[s] =z p

ga(o, p(t), c)f (t)t (t)s(t)ga(o, p(t), c 1)dt (2.1)

o

3

where t is a vector eld tangent to the curve c, t is a parameter along the
curve and p(t) is an ordinary point on the curve. in general, it may be written
as an object acting on any small deformation as

ea(c o,p)[] =z p

o

it is obtained from ga

ga(o, p(t), c)f (t)[t, ]ga(o, p(t), c 1)dt

ea(c o,p)[s] = g(p, c)(a(p ))g1(p, c) 

 g(p, c)[s]g1(p, c).

(2.2)

on small deformations s of the curve c with non zero variation of the endpoint
p. notice that

g(p + p, cs)g1(p, c) = g(p + sp s, cs)(1l (a[sp ]s)g1(p, c) +

+g(p + sp s, cs)(a[sp ]s)g1(p, c) + g(p + sp s, cs).

.(a[tp ]t)g1(p, c) = g(p + sp s, cs)(1l (a[sp ]s)g1(p, c)

+g(p, c)(a(p ))g1(p, c)

(2.3)

where cs is short for c o,p + c o,p. the last equality holds to rst order in s
and t,and

p = sp s + tp t.

we then obtain to rst order in s

ea(c o,p)[s]s = g(p + sp s, cs)(1l (a[sp ]s)g1(p, c)

+1l

g(t, c)f(t)s(t)g1(t, c)dts : +1l

=  exp :z tp
= z tp

0

g(t, c)f(t)t (t)s(t)g1(t, c)dts

0

(2.4)

(2.5)

that is eq. 2.1.

for zero deformations on the endpoint p then

and eq.2.1 still holds.

ea(c o,p) =  g(p, c)  g1(p, c).

ea(c) is dened for classes of equivalence of ordinary connections under gauge

transformations, i.e it is gauge invariant up to elements of the structure group
on the endpoints of the curve. this is a rather nice feature of working in path
or loop spaces . also, it depends on the curve c. from now on we will denote

ea(c o,p) as ea(p, c) making reference only to the endpoint p.

4

we could continue and dene also the lie algebra valued curvature func-

tional ef (c, a) for the connection functional ea in the usual manner

ef (c, a) = e ea(c) + ea(c)  ea(c)

for this free formulation of non abelian gauge theories, one shows easily that for
any small deformation with xed endpoints

and it is a gauge invariant statement. see that eq.2.5 implies that

ef (c, a) = 0

e(eg) = e(eag) = (eea  g  ea  eg)
this equation 2.6 shows an interesting property of e, namely

= (eea + ea  ea)g = 0.

ee = 0

(2.6)

reminiscent of an exterior dierential operator.

the covariant derivative ed may be also introduced as

ed   e  + ea  

now on the space of curves and deformations with xed endpoints [9], we

may impose a atness condition on general 1-forms functionals e that can lead

only to locally well dened non abelian principal bundles.

let us see how it works, take a at 1-form functional  on p x . we would
like to know about the existence of a non abelian bundle and of 1-form connec-
tions a on x for which

e(p, c) = ea(p, c).

g(t, c)(t)t (t)dxt

g1(t, c)dt

(2.7)

(2.8)

in here

e(p, c) =z tp

0

where  is a smooth general antisymmetric eld on x and g(t, c) is the path
ordered exponential of an arbitrary 1-form connection a and we have taken

[t, ] = (t)t (t)dxt

[]

in some particular local coordinate system {x }.

the atness condition reads,

ee +e e = 0,

5

(2.9)

consider an open covering of x and on u1 we solve the atness condition

for  obtaining

e(p, c) =z tp

c

gf t dxt

g1dt = ea(p, c).

(2.10)

so the unique solution, up to gauge transformations, is after some lenghty but
simple calculations

(t) = f(t)

with f(t) the lie algebra valued curvature eld with connection a, see ap-
pendix b of [9] for details.

by solving the same condition on u2 we obtain

in terms of another local pointwise 1-form connection a.

e(p, c) =fa(p, c)

(2.11)

on the intersection u1  u2 6=  we have, up to gauge transformations,

and after some calculations we then get

ea(p, c) =fa(p, c)

a = g1ag + g1dg.

(2.12)

(2.13)

i.e. the only way of a consistent patching it is through a matching of 1-
form functionals on intersections of p x, corresponding to gauge transformations
between pointwise 1-form connections on the intersection of neighborhoods u1
and u2 of x . we have thus avoided the obstruction discussed earlier by working
on p x with the generalized 1-form functional a.

the atness condition does not assure that a is a 1-form connection on a
non abelian principal bundle over x. as in the abelian case, a global restriction
is needed to ensure that local 1-forms with the transition dened through gauge
transformations, give rise to a globally dened 1-form connection on x. a
characterization of matrix-valued 2-forms for being curvatures of non abelian
bundles has also recently been conjectured using partial dierential equations
on a loop space [12].

thus, we have succeeded in eliminating the local obstruction to the construc-
tion of dual maps. now, it rests to nd a global condition equivalent to that of
integral periods of the curvature 2-form for abelian gauge theories, that actually
labels the dierent line bundles, i.e an equivalent dirac quantization condition.
we know that for particular su (2) bundles, there may be a splitting into the
direct sum of two line bundles, for those bundles the usual dirac quantization
may suce. in the space p x then the restriction to be imposed would be that

the ordinary curvature 2-form appearing in ea(c o,p) would belong to the set of

diagonalizable 2-form curvatures through a condition involving the intersec-
tion form and the non abelian topological charge associated to the second chern

6

class. this suggests that perhaps the global condition needed for non abelian
gauge theories, at least for the case of su (n ), involves the quantization of
the topological charge associated to the second chern class. once we nd the
exact global condition to be imposed on p x, and the dual map for constructing
dual gauge theories realized through an operation on p x that generalizes the
hodge- operation, we could arrive to an algorithm to get quantum equivalent
non abelian dual theories.

3 dual maps: the pre-dual 1-form functional b

in what follows we concentrate on dening dual maps on p x. having shown
that the formulation of yang - mills on p x avoids the problem of the con-
struction of a sequence for dual transformations in terms of curvatures, we will
now discuss the construction of the generalization of the hodge- operation and
then show that the yang - mills eld equations can be rewritten in a form which
are manifestly invariant under dual transformations. an attempt to dene that
operation for loop spaces has been given in [11]. in our construction we avoid
innity factors which appear in their work, as well as several regularizations in
their calculations. the regularizations are avoided by working directly with the
exterior algebra on p x as dened in [9].

we introduce a lie algebra valued 1-form functional over p x, b the pre-dual
1-form functional, constructed from the hodge- dual of the curvature 2-form.
first we construct a 2-surface  in the following way. given c  p x we
consider a family of curves ct obtained by a closed nite but small deformation
that starts and ends at c with tangent vectors s and parametrized by . we
identify t with the parametrization of the family of curves going smoothly from
o to p with tangent vector t . by construction one takes s and t commuting
with each other. also, if s is the 1-form associated to s in such a way that

s(s) = 1 then s(t ) = 0

the closed 2-surface  thus constructed has a north pole at p and a south pole
at o. we then dene b, the pre-dual 1-form functional associated to the dual
1-form functional connection related to the dual theory, as

b(p, ) :=z

g(, t)f (, t)t (, t)s (, t)s (, t)dx 

,tg1(, t)ddt.
(3.14)

where g(, t) is given as

g(, t) = ga(p(t), , ct)  exp :z 

p(t)

at :

p(t) is a generic point on the curve c. in the language of forms the last equation

7

may be written

b(p, ) :=z

g(, t)  f  s(s, t )g1(, t)ddt.

(3.15)

notice several interesting features of this denition. first, for the case of

u (1) abelian gauge theories eq.3.14 reduces to

b(p, ) :=z

f  s(s, t )ddt.

(3.16)

which diers only on a factor with length dimension from

ea(c o,p) =z p

o

f (t)[t ]dt

meaning that b is equivalent to a at 1-form functional representing, in path
space, an ordinary u (1) principal bundle. in this case, the bundle will be the
dual bundle with hodge - curvature f and connection a.

second, for the non abelian case, we could expand eq.3.14 to rst order when

we have close enough points o , p and small , obtaining

b(p, )  (fo + [fo(), fo] + . . .)()2

(3.17)

this equation shows that even to rst order it is necessary to introduce terms
involving the commutator of the 2-form curvature and its hodge - dual to
arrive to an approximation of a dual bundle. b, as we will show later, does not
represent a non abelian principal bundle on x since it does not in general solve
the at condition eq.2.9. but, it will represent a twisted version of the dual
bundle since through a map involving an automorphism of the lie algebra and
some other factors we get the non abelian dual in path space.

4 yang-mills eld equations on path space

we will only be interested in the application of b(p, ) to deformations that
are dierent from zero only in a small neighborhood of the 2-surface .

we show now that

over the yang - mills eld equations.

we will denote b  f  and compute the integral over the parameter
t in terms of a discretization (ti). also, cti  ci, and we write the arguments
of g only once in order to simplify the notation.

which is zero over the yang mills eld equations:

(4.24)

(4.25)

conversely, one may prove by taking arbitary small neighborhoods of a point
on c, and arbitrary deformations within these neighborhoods that one obtains
the yang-mills eld equations when

further it is also possible to show see [9], that on a contractible open set
u , u  x, where the curve c lies, for a lie algebra valued 1-form functional

e b = 0
e(p, c) in a matrix representation satisfying
ee(p, c) = 0

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

there exists a g, a path ordered exponential of a 1-form connection b, and a
map w such that

e(p, c) = w(p,c)  (eg(p, c)  g1)

where w(p,c) is an automorphism of the lie algebra representable in terms of
matrices. if the structure group is u (1) a solution for w is readily found to
be the identity map multipled by some factors fd that may be topological in
nature or related to the dierent density degrees of the 1-form functionals linked
by the map.

if instead e is at

then as earlier stated, there exists a g such that

w (p, c) = 1lfd

ee +e e = 0,

e = eg  g1 = ea(p, c).

5 the dual map for u (1) and su (n ) bundles

one may apply the last section results to get a solution for eq.4.25 in terms of
a particular path ordered exponential g and a connection a with which one

constructs the 1-form functional ea related to the dual theory,

ga(o, p(t), c)  f (t)[t, ]ga(o, p(t), c 1)dt

ea  (c o,p)[] =z p

o

10

thus, the yang-mills equations of motion are realized, via the pre-dual po-
tential b and the dual map w , by a at 1-form functional associated to a non
abelian principal bundle on the manifold x with curvature f and connection
a.

a possible solution for eq.4.25 would be, in a matrix representation

b = w 1

(p,c,s)(eg  (p, c)  g1)  w(p,c,s)fd(s)

(5.32)

.

the factor fd(s) has dimensions of length related to a particular radius of a
loop in the family of loops st (the closed deformations st making up the surface
) .this factor, resembling a coupling constant, arises from the fact that the
pre-dual potential b is constructed from a surface and the ordinary potential

in path space ea from a curve.

in general,w(p,c,s) will depend on the surface  and must satisfy ew = 0

for any deformation of . it will map to elements of the structure group and
will have a structure of a path ordered exponential containing terms like

exp(z

f (t, s))

f (t, s) is the ordinary lie algebra valued 2-form curvature integrated along t
and s. this term that necessarily appears in w introduces topological factors
in the dual map that may be labelling the bundles.

we may understand the last assertions comparing eq.3.14 and eq.5.32 in the

limit of very close points o and p and small surfaces .

6 conclusions

we have presented, in path space, a complete set of equations representing
the yang-mills equations and bianchi identities of ordinary non abelian gauge
b(p, c, s
theories. also we have introduced a new object the pre-dual potential
that allows the passage from a non abelian theory to its dual. we need further
to study the universe of solutions for the dual map and its relation to classifying
quantities for the unequivalent principal bundles.
