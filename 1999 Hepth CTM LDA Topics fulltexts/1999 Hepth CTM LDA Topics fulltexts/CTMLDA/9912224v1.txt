1 introduction

ann. phys. (leipzig) 11 (2000) 5

this contribution deals with the explanation of the quantum properties of black
holes (and, in particular, the statistical meaning of black hole entropy) hopefully
provided by string theory. most of the stringy literature has concentrated (for rea-
sons recalled below) on some special, supersymmetric extreme black holes (bps black
holes). [these black holes carry special (ramond-ramond) charges and their micro-
scopic structure seem to be describable in terms of dirichlet-branes.] by contrast,
we consider here the simplest, schwarzschild black holes (in any space dimension d).
it will be argued that their microscopic structure involves only fundamental string
states. however, the lack of supersymmetry means that it becomes essential to deal
with self-gravity eects.

to start with, let us recall that thirty years ago the study of the spectrum of string
theory revealed [1] a huge degeneracy of states growing as an exponential of the mass.
a few years later bekenstein [2] proposed that the entropy of a black hole should
be proportional to the area of its horizon in planck units, and hawking [3] xed the
constant of proportionality after discovering that black holes do emit thermal radiation
at a temperature thaw  r1
bh.
when string and black hole entropies are compared one immediately notices a strik-
ing dierence: string entropya is proportional to the rst power of mass in any number
of spatial dimensions d, while black hole entropy is proportional to a d-dependent power
of the mass, always larger than 1. in formulae:

where, as usual,  is the inverse of the classical string tension, s  h is the
quantum length associated with itb, ms  ph/ is the corresponding string mass

scale, rbh is the schwarzschild radius associated with m :

rbh  (gn m )1/(d2) ,

(2)

and we have used that, at least at suciently small coupling, the newton constant
and  are related via the string coupling by gn  g2()(d1)/2 (more geometrically,
d1

given their dierent mass dependence, it is obvious that, for a given set of the
fundamental constants gn , , g2, ss > sbh at suciently small m , while the opposite
is true at suciently large m . obviously, there has to be a critical value of m ,
mc, at which ss = sbh. this observation led bowick et al.
[4] to conjecture that
large black holes end up their hawking-evaporation process when m = mc, and then
transform into a higher-entropy string state without ever reaching the singular zero-
mass limit. this reasoning is conrmed [5] by the observation that, in string theory,
the fundamental string length s should set a minimal value for the schwarzschild
aas we shall discuss, the self-interaction of a string lifts the huge degeneracy of free string states.
one then denes the entropy of a narrow band of string states, dened with some energy resolution

radius of any black hole (and thus a maximal value for its hawking temperature). it
was also noticed [4], [6], [7] that, precisely at m = mc, rbh = s and the hawking
temperature equals the hagedorn temperature of string theory. for any d, the value
of mc is given by:

mc  msg2 .

(3)

susskind and collaborators [6], [8] went a step further and proposed that the spec-
trum of black holes and the spectrum of single string states be identical, in the
sense that there be a one to one correspondence between (uncharged) fundamental
string states and (uncharged) black hole states. such a correspondence principle
has been generalized by horowitz and polchinski [9] to a wide range of charged black
hole states (in any dimension). instead of keeping xed the fundamental constants
and letting m evolve by evaporation, as considered above, one can (equivalently) de-
scribe the physics of this conjectured correspondence by following a narrow band of
states, on both sides of and through, the string  black hole transition, by keeping
xed the entropyc s = ss = sbh, while adiabaticallyd varying the string coupling g,
i.e. the ratio between p and s. the correspondence principle then means that if
one increases g each (quantum) string state should turn into a (quantum) black hole
state at suciently strong coupling, while, conversely, if g is decreased, each black
hole state should decollapse and transform into a string state at suciently weak
coupling. for all the reasons mentioned above, it is very natural to expect that, when
starting from a black hole state, the critical value of g at which a black hole should
turn into a string is given, in clear relation to (3), by

in the case of extremal bps, and nearly extremal, black holes the conjectured cor-
respondence was dramatically conrmed through the work of strominger and vafa [10]
and others [11] leading to a statistical mechanics interpretation of black-hole entropy
in terms of the number of microscopic states sharing the same macroscopic quan-
tum numbers. however, little is known about whether and how the correspondence
works for non-extremal, non bps black holes, such as the simplest schwarzschild black
holee. by contrast to bps states whose mass is protected by supersymmetry, we shall
consider here the eect of varying g on the mass and size of non-bps string states.

cone uses here the fact that, during an adiabatic variation of g, the entropy of the black hole
bh /gn stays constant. this result (known to hold in the einstein conformal

sbh  (area)/gn  rd1
frame) applies also in string units because sbh is dimensionless.

dthe variation of g can be seen, depending on ones taste, either as a real, adiabatic change of g

due to a varying dilaton background, or as a mathematical way of following energy states.

efor simplicity, we shall consider in this work only schwarzschild black holes, in any number

d  d  1 of non-compact spatial dimensions.

although it is remarkable that black-hole and string entropy coincide when rbh =
s, this is still not quite sucient to claim that, when starting from a string state, a
string becomes a black hole at g = gc. in fact, the process in which one starts from a
string state in at space and increases g poses a serious puzzle [6]. indeed, the radius
of a typical excited string state of mass m is generally thought of being of order

rrw
s  s(m/ms)1/2 ,

(6)

as if a highly excited string state were a random walk made of m/ms = m/s
segments of length s [12].
[the number of steps in this random walk is, as is nat-
ural, the string entropy (1).] the random walk radius (6) is much larger than
the schwarzschild radius for all couplings g  gc, or, equivalently, the ratio of self-
gravitational binding energy to mass (in d spatial dimensions)

remains much smaller than one (when d > 2, to which we restrict ourselves) up to,
and including, the transition point. in view of (7) it does not seem natural to expect
that a string state will collapse to a black hole when g reaches the value (4). one
would expect a string state of mass m to turn into a black hole only when its typical
size is of order of rbh(m ) (which is of order s at the expected transition point (4)).
according to eq. (7), this seems to happen for a value of g much larger than gc.

horowitz and polchinski [13] have addressed this puzzle by means of a thermal
scalar formalism [14]. their results suggest a resolution of the puzzle when d = 3
(four-dimensional spacetime), but lead to a rather complicated behaviour when d  4.
moreover, even in the simple d = 3 case, the formal nature of the auxiliary thermal
scalar renders unclear (at least to me) the physical interpretation of their analysis.

here, i will review the results of a recent collaboration with g. veneziano [15]
whose aim was to clarify the string  black hole transition by a direct study, in real
spacetime, of the size and mass of a typical excited string, within the microcanonical
ensemble of self-gravitating strings. our results [15] lead to a rather simple picture
of the transition, in any dimension. we nd no hysteresis phenomenon in higher
dimensions. the critical value for the transition is (4), or (5) in terms of the entropy
s, for both directions of the string  black hole transition. in three spatial dimensions,
we nd that the size (computed in real spacetime) of a typical self-gravitating string is
0  (m/ms)3/2  s3/2,

result conrms the picture proposed by ref. [13] when d = 3, but with the bonus that
eq. (8) refers to a radius which is estimated directly in physical space (see below), and
which is the size of a typical member of the microcanonical ensemble of self-gravitating
strings. in all higher dimensionsf, we nd that the size of a typical self-gravitating

string remains xed at the random walk value (6) when g  gc. however, when g gets
close to a value of order gc, the ensemble of self-gravitating strings becomes (smoothly
in d = 4, but suddenly in d  5) dominated by very compact strings of size  s
(which are then expected to collapse with a slight further increase of g because the
dominant size is only slightly larger than the schwarzschild radius at gc).

our results [15] conrm and clarify the main idea of a correspondence between
string states and black hole states [6], [8], [9], [13], and suggest that the transition
between these states is rather smooth, with no apparent hysteresis, and with continuity
in entropy, mass, typical size, and luminosity. it is, however, beyond the technical
grasp of our analysis to compute any precise number at the transition (such as the
famous factor 1/4 in the bekenstein-hawking entropy formula).

the decomposition (9)(11) holds in any conformal gauge (( x   x )2 = 0).

one can further specify the choice of worldsheet coordinates by imposing

n x (, ) = 2(n p)  ,

(13)
where n is an arbitrary timelike or null vector (n  n  0) [16]. eq. (13) means that
the n-projected oscillators n 
m are set equal to zero. as we shall be interested in
quasi-classical, very massive string states (n  1) it should be possible to work in
the center of mass gauge, where the vector n used in eq. (13) to dene the  -slices
of the world-sheet is taken to be the total momentum p of the string. this gauge is
the most intrinsic way to describe a string in the classical limit. using this intrinsic
gauge, one can covariantly dene the proper rms size of a massive string state as

we wish to estimate the distribution function in size of the ensemble of free string
states of mass m , i.e. to count the number of string states, having some xed values
of m and r (or, equivalently, n and r). an approximate estimate of this number
(degeneracy) is [15]

d (m, r)  exp [c (r) a0 m ] ,
where a0 = 2  ((d  1) /6)1/2 and

with the coecients c1 and c2 being of order unity in string units. the coecient
c (r) gives the fractional reduction in entropy brought by imposing a size constraint.
note that (as expected) this reduction is minimized when c1 r2  c2 r2/m 2, i.e. for
r  rrw  spm/ms.

3 mass shift of string states due to self-gravity

we also need to estimate the mass shift of string states (of mass m and size r) due
to the exchange of the various long-range elds which are universally coupled to the
string: graviton, dilaton and axion. as we are interested in very massive string states,
m  ms, in extended congurations, r  s, we expect that massless exchange
[the exchange of
dominates the (state-dependent contribution to the) mass shift.
spin 1 elds (for open strings) becomes negligible when m  ms because it does not
increase with m .]
the evaluation, in string theory, of (one loop) mass shifts for massive states is
technically quite involved, and can only be tackled for the states which are near the
leading regge trajectory [19].
[indeed, the vertex operators creating these states
are the only ones to admit a manageable explicit oscillator representation.] as we
consider states which are very far from the leading regge trajectory, there is no hope
of computing exactly (at one loop) their mass shifts.

in ref. [15] we could estimate the one-loop mass-shift by resorting to a semi-
classical approximation. the starting point of this semi-classical approximation is

the eective action of self-gravitating fundamental strings derived in ref. [20]. using
coherent-state methods [21], [16], [22] and a generalization of blochs theorem (see
eq. (3.13) of [15]) one nds

(19)

the result (19) was expected in order of magnitude, but it is important to check
that it approximately comes out of a detailed calculation of the mass shift which
incorporates both relativistic and quantum eects and which uses the precise denition
(16) of the squared size.

finally, let us mention that, by using the same tools ref. [15] has computed the
imaginary part of the mass shift  m =  mreal  i /2, i.e. the total decay rate  in
massless quanta, as well as the total power radiated p . in order of magnitude these
quantities are

  g2 m , p  g2 m ms .

(21)

4 entropy of self-gravitating strings

finally one combines the results of the previous sections, eqs. (17) and (19), and
heuristically extend them at the limit of their domain of validity. we consider a
narrow band of string states that we follow when increasing adiabatically the string
coupling g, starting from g = 0. let m0, r0 denote the bare values (i.e. for g  0)
of the mass and size of this band of states. under the adiabatic variation of g, the
mass and size, m , r, of this band of states will vary. however, the entropys(m, r)
remains constant under this adiabatic process: s(m, r) = s(m0, r0). we consider
states with sizes s  r0  m0 for which the correction factor,

c (r0)  (1  c1 r2

0 ) (1  c2 r2

0/m 2

0 ) ,

in the entropy

s(m0, r0) = c (r0) a0 m0 ,

(22)

(23)

is near unity. [we use eq. (17) in the limit g  0, for which it was derived.] because
of this reduced sensitivity of c (r0) on a possible direct eect of g on r (i.e. r(g) =
r0 + g r), the main eect of self-gravity on the entropy (considered as a function of
the actual values m , r when g 6= 0) will come from replacing m0 as a function of m

8

ann. phys. (leipzig) 11 (2000) 5

and r. the mass-shift result (19) gives  m = m  m0 to rst order in g2. to the
same accuracyg, (19) gives m0 as a function of m and r:

m0  m + c3 g2 m 2

rd2 = m(cid:18)1 + c3

g2 m

rd2(cid:19) ,

where c3 is a positive numerical constant.

(24)

finally, combining eqs. (22)(24) (and neglecting, as just said, a small eect linked
to g r 6= 0) leads to the following relation between the entropy, the mass and the size
(all considered for self-gravitating states, with g 6= 0)
m 2(cid:19)(cid:18)1 +

s(m, r)  a0 m(cid:18)1

g2 m

rd2(cid:19) .

(25)

r2

for notational simplicity, we henceforth set to unity (by using suitable redenitions)
the coecients c1, c2 and c3. the possibility of smoothly transforming self-gravitating
string states into black hole states come from the peculiar radius dependence of the
entropy s(m, r). eq. (24) exhibits two eects varying in opposite directions: (i) self-
gravity favors small values of r (because they correspond to larger values of m0, i.e.
of the bare entropy), and (ii) the constraint of being of some xed size r disfavors

both small (r  m ) and large (r  m ) values of r. for given values of m

and g, the most numerous (and therefore most probable) string states will have a size
r(m ; g) which maximizes the entropy s(m, r). said dierently, the total degeneracy
of the complete ensemble of self-gravitating string states with total energy m (and no
a priori size restriction) will be given by an integral (where  r is the rms uctuation
of r)

d(m ) z dr

 r

es(m,r)  es(m,r)

(26)

which will be dominated by the saddle point r which maximizes the exponent.

the value of the most probable size r is a function of m , g and the space dimen-
sion d. we refer to ref. [15] for a full treatment. let us only indicate the results in
the (actual) case where d = 3. when maximizing the entropy s(m, r) with respect

to r one nds that: (i) when g2  m 3/2, the most probable size r(m, g)  m ,
(ii) when g2  m 3/2,

1 + 1 + 32



r(m, g) 
where   g2m .
eq. (27) says that, when g2 increases, and therefore when  increases (beyond
m 1/2) the typical size of a self-gravitating string decreases, and (formally) tends to a
limiting size of order unity, r = 3 (i.e. of order the string length scale s = 2)
when   1. however, the fractional self-gravity gn m/r  /r (which measures
the gravitational deformation away from at space) becomes unity for  = 5 and
formally increases without limit when  further increases. therefore, we expect that

(27)

gactually, eq. (24) is probably a more accurate version of the mass-shift formula because it exhibits

the real mass m (rather than the bare mass m0) as the source of self-gravity.

9

for some value of  of order unity, the self-gravity of the compact string state already
reached when   1 (indeed, eq. (27) predicts r  1 when   1) will become so
strong that it will (continuously) turn into a black hole state. having argued that the
dynamical threshold for the transition string  black hole is   1, we now notice that,
4 (g2m )2(cid:3) of the
for such a value of  the entropy s(m ) = s(m, r(m ))  a0 m(cid:2)1 + 1
string state (of mass m ) matches the bekenstein-hawking entropy sbh(m )  g2 m 2 =
m of the formed black hole. one further checks that the other global physical
characteristics of the string state (radius r, luminosity p , eq. (21)) match those of
a schwarzschild black hole of the same mass (rbh  gm  g2m , phawking  r2
bh)
when   1.

5 discussion

conceptually, the main new result of this paper concerns the most probable state
of a very massive singleh self-gravitating string. by combining our estimates of the
entropy reduction due to the size constraint, and of the mass shift we come up with
the expression (25) for the logarithm of the number of self-gravitating string states
of size r. our analysis of the function s(m, r) claries the correspondence [6], [8],
[9], [13] between string states and black holes. in particular, our results conrm many
of the results of [13], but make them (in our opinion) physically clearer by dealing
directly with the size distribution, in real space, of an ensemble of string states. when
our results dier from those of [13], they do so in a way which simplies the physical
picture and make even more compelling the existence of a correspondence between
strings and black holes. the simple physical picture suggestedi by our results is the
following: in any dimension, if we start with a massive string state and increase the
string coupling g, a typical string state will, eventually, become more compact and
will end up, when c = g2
c m  1, in a condensed state of size r  1, and mass
density   g2
. note that the basic reason why small strings, r  1, dominate in
any dimension the entropy when   1 is that they descend from string states with
bare mass m0  m (1 + /rd2)  2m which are exponentially more numerous than
less condensed string states corresponding to smaller bare masses.
the nature of the transition between the initial dilute state and the nal con-
densed one depends on the value of the space dimension d. in d = 3, the transition is
gradual: when  < m 1/2 the size of a typical state is r(d=3)
 m 1/2(1  m 1/2 /8),
when  > m 1/2 the typical size is r(d=3)
in d = 4, the
transition toward a condensed state is still continuous, but most of the size evolu-
tion takes place very near  = 1: when  < 1, r(d=4)
 m 1/2(1  )1/4, and when
 > 1,r(d=4)
 (2/(  1))1/2, with some smooth blending between the two evolu-
hwe consider states of a single string because, for large values of the mass, the single-string entropy

approximates the total entropy up to subleading terms.

iour conclusions are not rigourously established because they rely on assuming the validity of the
result (25) beyond the domain (r2  1, g2 m/rd2  1) where it was derived. however, we nd
heuristically convincing to believe in the presence of a reduction factor of the type 1  r2 down to
sizes very near the string scale. our heuristic dealing with self-gravity is less compelling because we
do not have a clear signal of when strong gravitational eld eects become essential.

tions around |  1|  m 2/3. in d  5, the transition is discontinuous (like a rst
order phase transition between, say, gas and liquid states). barring the consideration
of metastable (supercooled) states, on expects that when  = 2   /(  1)1
(with  = (d  2)/2), the most probable size of a string state will jump from rrw
(when  < 2) to a size of order unity (when  > 2).

one can think of the condensed state of (single) string matter, reached (in any
d) when   1, as an analog of a neutron star with respect to an ordinary star (or
a white dwarf). it is very compact (because of self gravity) but it is stable (in some
range for g) under gravitational collapse. however, if one further increases g or m
(in fact,  = g2 m ), the condensed string state is expected (when  reaches some
3 > 2, 3 = o(1)) to collapse down to a black hole state (analogously to a neutron
star collapsing to a black hole when its mass exceeds the landau-oppenheimer-volko
critical mass). still in analogy with neutron stars, one notes that general relativistic
strong gravitational eld eects are crucial for determining the onset of gravitational
collapse; indeed, under the newtonian approximation (25), the condensed string
state could continue to exist for arbitrary large values of .

it is interesting to note that the value of the mass density at the formation of the
condensed string state is   g2. this is reminiscent of the prediction by atick and
witten [23] of a rst-order phase transition of a self-gravitating thermal gas of strings,
near the hagedorn temperaturej, towards a dense state with energy density   g2
(typical of a genus-zero contribution to the free energy). ref. [23] suggested that this
transition is rst-order because of the coupling to the dilaton. this suggestion agrees
with our nding of a discontinuous transition to the single string condensed state in
dimensions  5 (ref. [23] work in higher dimensions, d = 25 for the bosonic case). it
would be interesting to deepen these links between self-gravitating single string states
and multi-string states.

let us come back to the consequences of the picture brought by the present work for
the problem of the end point of the evaporation of a schwarzschild black hole and the
interpretation of black hole entropy. in that case one xes the value of g (assumed to
be  1) and considers a black hole which slowly looses its mass via hawking radiation.
when the mass gets as low as a valuek m  g2, for which the radius of the black
hole is of order one (in string units), one expects the black hole to transform (in all
dimensions) into a typical stringl state corresponding to  = g2 m  1, which is a
dense state (still of radius r  1). this string state will further decay and loose mass,
predominantly via the emission of massless quanta, with a quasi thermal spectrum
with temperature t  thagedorn = a1
0 which smoothly matches the previous black
hole hawking temperature. this mass loss will further decrease the product  = g2 m ,
and this decrease will, either gradually or suddenly, cause the initially compact string
state to inate to much larger sizes. for instance, if d  4, the string state will
jnote that, by denition, in our single string system, the formal temperature t = (s/m )1 is

always near the hagedorn temperature.

knote that the mass at the black hole  string transition is larger than the planck mass mp 
(gn )1/2  g1 by a factor g1  1.
la check on the single-string dominance of the transition black hole  string is to note that
the single string entropy  m/ms is much larger than the entropy of a ball of radiation srad 
(rm )d/(d+1) with size r  rbh  s at the transition.

quickly inate to a size r  m . later, with continued mass loss, the string size
will slowly shrink again toward r  1 until a remaining string of mass m  1 nally
decays into stable massless quanta. in this picture, the black hole entropy acquires a
somewhat clear statistical signicance (as the degeneracy of a corresponding typical
string state) only when m and g are related by g2 m  1.
if we allow ourselves
to vary (in a gedanken experiment) the value of g this gives a potential statistical
signicance to any black hole entropy value sbh (by choosing g2  s1
bh). we do not
claim, however, to have a clear idea of the direct statistical meaning of sbh when
g2 sbh  1. neither do we clearly understand the fate of the very large space (which
could be excited in many ways) which resides inside very large classical black holes
of radius rbh  (g2 sbh)1/(d1)  1. the fact that the interior of a black hole of
given mass could be arbitrarily largem, and therefore arbitrarily complex, suggests that
black hole physics is not exhausted by the idea (conrmed in the present paper) of a
reversible transition between string-length-size black holes and string states.

on the string side, we also do not clearly understand how one could follow in detail
(in the present non bps framework) the transformation of a strongly self-gravitating
string state into a black hole state.

finally, let us note that we expect that self-gravity will lift nearly completely the de-
generacy of string states. [the degeneracy linked to the rotational symmetry, i.e. 2j +1
in d = 3, is probably the only one to remain, and it is negligible compared to the string
entropy.] therefore we expect that the separation  e between subsequent (string and
black hole) energy levels will be exponentially small:  e   m exp(s(m )), where
 m is the canonical-ensemble uctuation in m . such a  e is negligibly small com-
pared to the radiative width   g2 m of the levels. this seems to mean that the
discreteness of the quantum levels of strongly self-gravitating strings and black holes
is very much blurred, and dicult to see observationally.
