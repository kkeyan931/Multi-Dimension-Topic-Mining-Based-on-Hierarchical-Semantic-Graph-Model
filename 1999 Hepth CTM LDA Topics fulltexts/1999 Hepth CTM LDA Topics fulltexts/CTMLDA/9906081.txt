congurations type iia/b string theory seiberg-witten curves n = 2 {$9407087$} given geometrical realization {$9703166$}, running coupling related bending ns branes {$9703166$}, n = 1 seiberg duality {$9411149$} realized exchange ns supports . though much understanding gained supersymmetric theories, branes congurations failed teach us non-supersymmetric gauge theories, since non-susy brane congurations usually stable. important direction study non-susy gauge theories use branes context type 0 string theory{$9811035$}. type 0 string theory dened world sheet exactly like type ii, except non-chiral gso projection performed. resulting sectors theory (ns- ,ns-),(ns+,ns+) doubled set r-r elds. low-energy elds theory therefore tachyon, bosonic (ns,ns) elds type ii two-copies r-r elds. accordingly two types d-branes exists. refer two kinds electric magnetic, pair electric magnetic dyonic. dyonic combination branes called also untwisted , belongs untwisted sector description type 0 orbifold theory. klebanov tseytlin argued background d-branes, r-r ux cure tachyon instability gauge theory branes perfectly ok. using electric d3 branes constructed su(n) gauge theory six adjoint scalars {$9811035$} studied behavior ads/cft inspired way {$9611230$}. recent related works see . another interesting construction uses stack n coincident dyonic d3 branes{$9611230$}. case dyonic brane thought pair made electric magnetic brane. strings connect electric- electric magnetic-magnetic branes yields su e(n)su m(n) gauge theory 6 magnetic adjoint scalars 6 electric adjoint scalars. addi- tion strings connect electric-magnetic branes give rise additional 4 bifundamental weyl fermions (n, n) another 4 bifundamental weyl fermions ( n, n) {$9611230$}. model similarities orbifold models kachru silverstein{$9611230$}. although cannot obtained string orbifold type iib, viewed eld theory orbifold 1 truncation (in sense ref.{$9611230$}) n = 4 u(2n) super yang-mills{$9611230$}. interesting remark although theory non-susy admits moduli space vacua. gravity solution conguration ads5 s5 space con- stant dilaton zero tachyon. therefore klebanov tseytlin interpreted theory non-susy cft{$9611230$}. fact stringy solution type 0 dyonic d3 branes type ii surprising. consider dyonic branes type 0 (i.e. identifying electric magnetic branes), solution zero tachyon massless bosonic elds type ii would exist. additional conditions large n small enough hooft coupling{$9611230$}. reason similarity cases, s-matrix sphere amplitudes elds common type 0 type ii coincide {$9811035$}. therefore low-energy eective action type 0 almost same. dierences existence two r-r elds presence tachyon coupled elds even powers. result, nd solution equations motion tachyon zero two kinds r-r elds identied. exactly type ii solution. important remark necessity large n. higher order contributions tree level action (string loops) may contribute terms even powers tachyon, hence zero tachyon solution cease exist. however, contributions suppressed large n limit. another remark r-r ux expected shift tachyon mass positive values hooft coupling small enough. therefore limit, solution zero tachyon expected stable. eld theory point view, class theories consider fall class orbifold eld theories. shown ref.{$9611230$}, later generalized case product groups {$9611230$}, certain truncation supersymmetric eld theories would yield non-supersymmetric gauge theory exactly large n green functions (in untwisted sector). show, type 0 truncation corresponds orbifold projection. important feature theories exist small enough values hooft coupling ({$9611230$} nd < 100 n = 4 theories). orbifold non-susy theories inherit subset operators. 2 exist susy theory. operator couples tachyon bulk. long particular operator tr f 2 1 tr f 2 2 small enough, two point function operator non-tachyonic. however, large values dimension operator becomes complex non-susy theory well dened. parent susy theory operator therefore well dened values . 1 paper, would like generalize d3 solution complicated cases include ns branes. since reasoning hold case also, expect non-supersymmetric theory lives analogous brane conguration would share many properties supersymmetric one. particular, large n limit, theories would perturbative green functions hence perturbative beta function. important remark validity approach subjected assumption non-perturbative equivalence non-susy untwisted sector parent. simplest example n = 2 brane conguration type ii. also expect exactly dyonic directions mass spectrum dyonic sector bose-fermi degenerate, though non-susy. special case nf = 2nc large n non-susy cft. another class large n non- susy cfts constructed type 0 analogue brane-boxes congurations. type 0 analogue n = 1 conguration yields non-supersymmetric version seiberg duality. particular, type 0 theories expected maintain phase structure nf /nc axis. theories special case theories considered past schmaltz showed large n orbifold eld theories n = 1 admits duality{$9611230$}. interesting present case duality understood also via branes. open questions raised discussion. discuss large n non-susy eld theories dynamics supersymmet- ric ones. particular theories number bosons fermions. one wonders symmetry (not susy) re- sponsible that. supersymmetric parent particle spectrum divided bps non-bps. expect distinction carry non-susy theory, masses bps particles given bps-like formula. intrinsic way distinguish two kinds? organization paper follows: section 2 describe

section 4 devoted study non-susy analogues n = 2 . section 5 consider non-susy version seiberg duality. describe nite non-susy models using brane boxes section 6. section 7 devoted conclusions. 2 type 0 string theory type ii a/b string theories non-supersymmetric analogues called type 0 a/b. type 0 theories constructed via non-chiral gso projection keeps following bosonic sectors type 0a: (ns, ns) (ns+, ns+) (r+, r) (r, r+) type 0b: (ns, ns) (ns+, ns+) (r+, r+) (r, r) tree level type 0b action (ns+, ns+) sector exactly type iib action{$9811035$} = 2z ddxge2(cid:18)r + 4(n)2 1 12 h 2 mnk(cid:19)

ddxgh(n+1)(t )|fn+1|2 , (3) fn+1 eld strength dyonic r-r elds h(n+1)(t ) de- scribes coupling tachyon r-r elds. note although functions h(n+1)(t ) known, symmetry arguments coupling electric magnetic forms require functions even dyonic case. therefore clear solution dyonic background = 0 solution bosonic elds type ii supergravity. 4 statement trivial tree level, certainly wrong gs > 0{$9611230$}, since torus amplitudes generate odd tachyon contributions action. therefore similarities supersymmetric type ii gauge theories non-supersymmetric type 0 theories expected occur large n limit, like d3 type 0 case {$9611230$}, orbifold models kachru silverstein {$9611230$} non-supersymmetric version seiberg n = 1 duality considered schmaltz {$9611230$}. note also order stable = 0 solution, must shift tachyon mass. since function h(t ) contains 2 part, large enough r-r ux tachyon mass-squared becomes positive. background dp brane, condition translates requirement small hooft coupling. 3 type

procedure given intrinsic denition eld theory, shall discuss now. new eld theory constructed certain (orbifold) projection susy eld theory. amplitudes untwisted external legs non-susy theory identical, large n limit, amplitudes parent theory. n = 4 (the type 0 version n = 4 ) shown {$9611230$} put type 0 projection form suitable general methods . one starts u(2nc) n = 4 theory performs z2

magnetic-electric, index either color avor. {$9611230$} checked proven large n amplitudes preserved. important remark non- susy theory contains operators, tr f 2 2 , exist parent theory. operators may become tachyonic (their anomalous dimension may become complex) therefore non-susy theory sick. 1 tr f 2 4 n = 2 brane conguration consider type 0 analogue n = 2 theory gauge group su(nc) nf matter

class theories, given {$9611230$}. branes gives simple evidence n = 1 duality holds. one may simply repeat steps {$9702014$}. dyonic branes dynamics type 0 identical type ii therefore starting electric theory one would end magnetic theory. eld theory arguments favor duality based on{$9611230$}. since green functions untwisted sector, large n, identical, fol- lows type 0 eld theory phase
