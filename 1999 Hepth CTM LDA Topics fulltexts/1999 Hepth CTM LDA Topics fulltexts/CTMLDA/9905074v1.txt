abstract

the vortex-like solution to the no-linear eld equations in a two-dimensional su (2)
gauge theory with the chern-simons mass term is found at high temperature. it is
derived from the eective lagrangian including the leading order nite temperature
corrections. the discovered eld conguration possesses the nite energy and the
quantized magnetic ux. at the centre of the vortex the point charge is located which
is surrounded by the distributed charge of the opposite sign and the vortex is neutral
as a whole. at high temperature the energy of the vortex is negative and it corresponds
to the ground state. the derived solution is considered to be a result of heating the
lattice vacuum structure formed at zero temperature.

1 introduction

over the last decade gauge theories in two spatial dimensions have been the object of consid-
erable interest. the origins of this interest are manifold. first, these theories have a number
of interesting features which make them quite dierent from theories in the conventional
space-time. there is, for example, a possibility of introducing a mass term for the gauge
eldthe chern-simons (cs) topological massin a gauge invariant way [1].
in fact, if
not added by hand, this mass is necessarily generated by the fermion loop corrections [2, 3].
second, at high temperature eld theories in a (3+1)-dimensional space-time eectively be-
have as theories in a 3-dimensional euclidean space [4]. third, low-dimensional theories
are successfully applied to the condensed matter physics phenomenaquantum hall eect,
high-t superconductivitywhich proved to have an essentially planar nature [5, 6].

it is well known that the non-abelian gauge eld vacuum becomes unstable in an ex-
ternal magnetic eld due to a tachyonic mode present in the gluon spectrum [7, 8]. this
holds for both three- and two-dimensional models. searches for the true vacuum state of

the non-abelian gauge elds have led to the discovery of gauge eld condensation in an ex-
ternal magnetic eld [911]. the mechanism of the structure generation included exciting
of tachyonic modes in intense magnetic elds. also, a scalar eld should be present in or-
der to stabilize the condensate. an essential feature of this vacuum is its lattice structure
which results in a breakdown of vacuum homogeneity. this picture is similar to that of
superconductivity [12], although the origin of tachyonic modes is dierent.

in ref. [13] it has been shown that in 2d gauge theories there is a mechanism of the
vacuum structure formation quite distinct from that in 3+1 space-time. it occurs due to
the cs mass m presence, in the magnetic elds below the tachyonic threshold in the gluon
spectrum, and does not involve the condensation of unstable modes. the vacuum state of
the su(2) theory in external magnetic eld has been found to be a periodic electromagnetic
structure; both magnetic and electric elds are present, and form a triangular lattice with
a period  1/m. each cell contains magnetic ux quantized in a manner similar to super-
conductivity. the conguration is a perturbative solution to the non-linear eld equations.
generation of a pure magnetic structure is suppressed by the cs term, which mixes electric
and magnetic components of the colour elds. as a result, the a0 component of the gauge
potential plays an important role in the vacuum structure formation. as the threshold of the
tachyonic mode appearance set by the topological mass is not reached, the derived state is
stable. the lattice has been found to lower the energy of the applied homogeneous magnetic
eld. moreover, when h = 0, the energy density is negative and the condensate can be
generated spontaneously without an external magnetic eld. it is the cs mass that gives
the origin to this new type of vacuum structure, which has no analogues among lattices
studied in the other models.

the analysis carried out in ref. [13] has a general character and allows extension to the
case when the cs mass is generated at the one-loop level. therefore, the noted mechanism
could produce the gluon eld vacuum structure in various external environments. this
possibility has been examined in the nite temperature model [14]. the technique applied
was essentially the one of zero temperature case. as it appeared, the periodic vacuum
structure persists at nite temperature, and is generated due to the same mechanism as at
t = 0. the crucial factor for the lattice formation is again the topological mass presence.
however, it has been found that the amplitude of the gauge eld condensate increases as
the temperature rises. as a consequence, at high temperature t  m the results obtained
it has been argued that
within a perturbative method should be treated with caution.
the analysis of the non-linear equations is needed to describe the vacuum evolution at high
temperature.

the main goal of the present paper is to investigate how the vacuum structure is aected
by high temperature when the perturbation theory is not adequate. to do this we solve
the non-linear equations of motion for the topologically massive gluon elds derived from
the eective lagrangian (el). in contrast to the magnetic lattice case, when the cs mass is
present an electric eld is generated in a vacuum and, so, the a0 component is not decoupled.
therefore, we should not fail to take into account the debye mass when constructing the
lef f . we consider the one-loop gluon eective lagrangian of the two-dimensional gauge
theory at high temperature. the thermal contribution is introduced via the one-loop gluon

2

polarization tensor in the static limit. we take into consideration the leading in t term of
the debye mass, , which is  g2t in 2+1 dimensions. the one-loop induced cs coecient
in the el is usually modied at nite temperature by the factor of tanh mf /t . we will
discuss the implications of such temperature dependence below. with thermal eects thus
included, the following results have been obtained.

an exact solution to the non-linear gluon eld equations has been found. the solution is
static and axially symmetric; the elds form a vortex in both coordinate and gauge spaces. at
spatial boundary the gluon potentials constituting the solution become a pure gauge. both
electric and magnetic elds are present in the derived conguration. due to the cs and the
temperature masses presence the elds are short-range, and vanish exponentially at r  
and t  . the extent of the area in which the elds are localized is determined by the
inverted eective mass m = m2 + 2. so, at spatial innity the conguration approaches
the perturbative vacuum. the important feature of the found solution is niteness of the
total energy of the vortex. the sign of energy is not constant, it is determined by the sign
of the combination m2  2. the electric eld has a coulomb-like behaviour at the origin
signalling the presence of a point charge. it cancels exactly the density of the continuously
distributed charge resulting in the neutral eld conguration. thus, the derived solution
to the eld equation describes the composite of a vortex, which possesses nite energy and
magnetic ux, and a point charge.

the picture summarized above corresponds quite well to the lattice solution found in
refs. [13, 14].
in fact, the vortex can be considered as a result of heating the vacuum
structure. depending on the sign of the free energy, the vortex solution can describe either
particle-like excitation over the periodic vacuum structure, or the vacuum state represented
by the system of isolated vortices. we note once again that the discovered conguration exists
because the equation of motion are derived from the eective lagrangian, which includes
the temperature mass contribution for a0 component of the gluon eld.

we want to build the one loop eective lagrangian of gauge elds and, to do this,
integrate over the fermion degrees of freedom. as a result, two additional terms appear in
lef f . the rst is contributed by the parity-even part of gluon polarization tensor ab
; the
second is parity-violating one intrinsic to odd-dimensional space-time, the well known cs
term [2, 3]:

where n is an integer. we note that the coupling g has dimension of m1/2 in 2+1 space-time.
we are interested in obtaining the gluon eective lagrangian at nite temperature. the
polarization tensor ab

in high-temperature approximation. the following expression for the 00 component has
been calculated

here mf is the fermion mass and by  we denoted the debye mass. all the other components
of the polarization tensor  vanish in the zero-momentum limit k0 = 0, ~k  0.
calculations of the cs term at nite temperature has drawn much attention recently.
in a number of papers (see, for instance [3, 15, 16]) there has been obtained by applying
various perturbative methods, that the one-loop expression for the cs mass is given at nite
temperature by

m(t )  m(t = 0) tanh mf
t .

(5)

such a smooth dependence on the temperature is, of course, in conict with the gauge
invariance. as has been argued in refs. [17, 18], since the cs mass has to take discrete
values, it should not be modied by nite temperature corrections. recently, there has been
signicant progress in resolving this puzzle.
it has been found [1921] that, when large
gauge transformations are taken into account, the full eective action is gauge invariant,
while the perturbative expansion is not. thus, the apparent gauge non-invariance of the
nite temperature chern-simons coecient is only a result of considering the rst term in
the expansion of the eective action.1

therefore, we can write the expression for the high-temperature one-loop eective la-

here we have also set a(r) = 1
gr . these equations are now linear, but still rather complicated
for exhaustive analysis. further simplication can be achieved if we set the ansatz functions
1, 2 to be time independent and axially symmetric. under these assumptions our ansatz
describes a static solution to non-linear equations of motion that has the form of a vortex in
both coordinate and internal spaces. then the third equation in (9) is satised identically,

we see that both squared masses, chern-simons one and temperature generated, enter the

2(r) = ak1(mr) + bi1(mr).

integrating (13) and leaving out the part of the solution that diverges exponentially at spatial

one can see that both electric and magnetic elds are screened by the mass m, and van-

which is a pure gauge. magnetic ux through the two-dimensional space is nite,

however, with appropriately chosen constants a, c we can cancel the term  r2 and make

(24)

thus, we have found the static solution to the yang-mills equations that possesses nite
energy, i.e. a two-dimensional soliton. since asymptotic values of the elds correspond to
the perturbative vacuum solution, this solitonic conguration does not have a topological
nature. we note that the niteness of energy became possible due to the debye mass being
taken into account. if we set  = 0, the only choice of the constants leading to cancellation
of 1/r2 divergence in h would be a = c = 0. this would leave us with a pure gauge solution
equivalent to aa
 = 0. one can see as well, that the full energy changes sign: it is positive if
m > , and negative otherwise. implications of this fact we will discuss below.

now we consider the charge density of the system. the time component of the relevant

vanishes on the vortex solution (16). we see that for all the calculated quantities their
non-abelian structure factorizes as a. this is true for the gauge potentials as well, up to
the pure gauge contribution. so, in a sense, the introduced ansatz can be thought of as an
abelian one. further, we calculate the electric charge density as div ~e, and integrate it over
the whole space to obtain

qa = z d2x iea

i = 2az dr r amk0(mr) = a 2a

m

.

(26)

so, the charge of the vortex appears to have the nite value. on the other hand the electric
eld ux through the spatial boundary vanishes due to the mass screening. these facts can
be reconciled if we recall that the electric eld behaves as 1/r at r  0

ea

i |r0 = a i(cid:18) a

mr

+ o(r ln r)(cid:19) ,

(27)

which is the 2-dimensional coulomb law. thus a point charge is present at the centre of the
vortex, of the value

qpoint =

(28)

2a
m

and the total electric charge of the vortex q + qpoint is zero.
it well corresponds to the
picture described in [13], where it has been found that each lattice cell has a positive core
surrounded by negative charge distribution, in such a way that the total charge vanishes.

4 discussion of the results

in the present paper, the exact solution to the non-linear equations of motion for the topolog-
ically massive gauge eld is derived at high temperature. to treat the problem consistently,

7

the additional term  a2
000(t ) has been introduced to the eective lagrangian. this is the
key point of our analysis that has the general character at nite temperature in theories with
the chern-simons mass. in this respect the situation is quite dierent as compared to the
superconductivity and electroweak theory. in both those models there is no mixing between
the electric and the magnetic sectors. the temperature inuences the vortices through the
mass of the condensed scalar eld. in the considered model the vortex is formed from the
short-range colour magnetic and electric elds. the full energy of the conguration is nite.
as the elds are screened by the eective mass m (12), at spatial innity the perturbative
vacuum solution is realized. the total charge of the vortex is zero; the magnetic ux through
the plane is nite.

let us discuss the most important features of the discovered eld conguration. if we
set t = 0, our solution transforms into the divergent-energy solution of ref. [22]. we stress
once again that it is the addition of the debye mass into the eective lagrangian that makes
the full energy nite. in fact, at high temperature it alone determines the eective mass
parameter m  , and the role of the cs mass is restricted to introducing the ansatz
solutions to the non-linear eld equations. it is worth noting that obtained conguration is
composed from the gauge elds only. the vortex solutions in chern-simons theories obtained
earlier [23] have been derived from the lagrangians including higgs elds.

the physical contents of the derived eld conguration varies. as we see, the energy
of the vortex (24) is positive when m2 > 2  g2t . thus, if this condition holds the
derived solution describes the two-dimensional non-topological temperature soliton. since
in this case the perturbative approach used in ref. [14] is consistent, we have to conclude
that when t  m the ground state of the theory is the gluon condensate lattice with the
period  1/m determined by the cs mass. the vortex solution, then, corresponds to the
particle-like eld excitation over the lattice vacuum structure.

at high temperature  > m the situation is quite dierent. the vortex eld conguration
possesses negative energy and, therefore, one has to treat it as the ground state of the
model.
it is natural to consider this vacuum as the result of the evolution of the lattice
vacuum structure of gluon condensate created at zero temperature, each cell developing into
a vortex. indeed, comparing the single lattice cell with the vortex puts forward a number
of similarities. in both cases we have gluon condensate formed from the magnetic, as well
as radial electric eld. the magnetic eld is maximal at the centre of the conguration,
falling o towards the boundary; the magnetic ux is nite. the charge density distribution
is similar as well: a core in the centre encircled by the charge of the opposite sign. thus, one
can conjure up the following qualitative picture of the vacuum aected by the temperature.
as the vacuum structure is heated, the period of the lattice, which is determined by the cs
mass value, grows d  1/m  t , as it follows from equation (5). eventually, the distance
between ux tubes exceeds the characteristic scale  1/m, the lattice cells decouple and
at high temperature each of them develops into the vortex eld conguration. the ground
state thus becomes a plane covered with scattered non-interacting gauge eld vortices. the
stability of the derived eld conguration is ensured by the magnetic ux conservation.
therefore, at high temperature the vacuum of the considered model is represented as the
system of isolated vortices formed from colour electric and magnetic elds.
