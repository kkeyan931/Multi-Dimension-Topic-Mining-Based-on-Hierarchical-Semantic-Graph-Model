abstract

the formalism of the principal superber-bundle is applied to
quantum nonsymmetric gravitationl theory. it is shown that the met-
ric and faddev-popov elds arise as superelds components of the su-
perconnection. moreover,the brst and anti-brst transformations
are shown to be the gauge transformations of parameters the ghost
and anti-ghost superelds.

1 introduction:

the gravitational force is the oldest interaction known to man and the least
understood.
it is the dimensionful character of the gravitational constant
which destroys the prodictivity of the theory. that is,it is impossible to have
a quantum consistent renormalizable theory. since all the present day exper-
imental data conrm general relativity (gr),any future quantum or other
kind of a gravitation theory should be an extension rather than a replace-
ment of g.r. one alternative is to treat g.r as a special case of an extended
(or general) theory,namely nonsymmetric gravitation theory (ngt) [1]-[8].
the most appealing feature of the theory is that all its theoretical predictions
are compatible with the existing classical experimental tests which have con-
rmed the validity of g.r. moreover,the recently proposed fth force ,can
be contained naturally in the ngt formalism . furthermore,the quantum
version of this theory was recently proposed (qngt) [9] and its turns out
that it contains a larger symmetry [10]-[13] which may resolve the outstand-
ing problem of the renormalizability . despite all this progress and as it is
the case of gauge theories,one needs a natural geometrical interpretation of
qngt within the framework of the mathematical structure of the principal
ber bundle.

the mathematical structure of gauge theories was displayed by wu and
yang who established a dictionary of equivalences between physical terms
and mathematical concepts[14]. thus a pure gauge theory is described by
a principal ber bundle p(x,g),with base space x (the space-time mani-
fold) and structure group g (the gauge group). the gauge elds a and
the strength eld tensor f are the coecients of a connection (1-form) in
the principal ber bundle and its curvature (2-form) respectively in a local
coordinate system in p. in this scheme,the gauge transformations are ber
bundle equivalences.

when a gauge theory is quantized,one needs to introduce in the la-

grangian a gauge xing term so that the eect it produce is two fold:

i)new spinless and anti-commuting elds appear (the so called faddeev-

popov elds (fp).

ii)the original gauge invariance is broken and a new invariance called

2

brst arises.

it is important to mention that fp elds and brst transformations
do not appear in the wu-yangs dictionary to provide them with a precise
geometrical interpretation.

the aim of this work is to nd out a natural geometrical interpretation of
fp elds as well as brst and anti-brst transformations of qngt within
the structure framework of the of the principal ber bundle. to this end,we
use the concepts of supermanifold,supergroup and superber bundle which
have been developed in ref.[15]-[19].

in section 2,we give a brief summary and notions on supermanifold, super-
forms and superbers,in section 3,we use the mathematical structure of the
principal superber-bundle to give a geometrical description of qngt and
show that the metric and fp elds arise as superelds components of the con-
nection in a local coordinate system. moreover,the brst and anti-brst
transformations arise as gauge transformations of parameters the ghost and
anti-ghost superelds. in section 4,we draw our conclusions.

2 supermanifold,superforms and superbers:

a z2 graded vector space b is a direct sum of two vector b0 and b1:

b = b0  b1

(2.1)

where b0 and b1 are called the even and odd parts of b. if b is endowed with
a norm (induced norm) it is called a z2 graded banach space. an element
b  b or is said to be homogeneous if b  b0 or b  b1 with:

| b |=( 0

1

if b  b0
if b  b1

(2.2)

( ||  means grade) . now,if n is the nilpotent part of b,i.e. b = rn ,thus
one can dene the body and soul projections b and s respectively through
the application:b : b  r and s : b  n . the cartesian product s m+n
is constructed in a graded b module as follows:

where

s m+n= s m,ns m,n

(2.3)

3

and

s m,n = (b0)m  (b1)n

s m,n = (b1)m  (b0)n

(2.4)

(2.5)

then,one can generalize the notion of a manifold which is locally dieo-
morph to rn,to a supermanifold where vector space rn is replaced by the
superspace s m,n. consequently, a supermanifold of dimension (m, n) is de-
ned as a topological space endowed with a superatlas {(ui,i)} where ui is
ii ui and i is an homeomorphism of ui in s m,n. if u
an open set of m = u
is an open set of m then,the set of superdierentiable functions of u in b is
denoted by b (u). a vectorial supereld dened on u is an element  of a
vectorial space endomorphic to b (u) such that:

 (f g) = (f ) g + (1)|||f | f (g)
 (af ) = (1)|||a| a (f )

f, g  b (u)
f  b (u) ;a  b

(2.6)

thus,the set of vectorial superelds dened on m and denoted by d (m)

has the following properties:

d (u) is a set left graded b module i.e.:

f  b (u) ;   d (u) = (f )  d (u)

with the following braket operation:

[x, y ] = xy  (1)|x||y | y x

(2.7)

(2.8)

thus,if (x, )=1,m =1,n is a chart of coordinates over m then 
and 

  d (u)1 allow to write locally the supereld x as:
f , f   b (u)

f  


x =

f  

x +

mp=1

np=1

x  d (u)0

(2.9)

in the same manner as in the classical dierential geometry,one can dene
a dierentiable p -superform  over a supermanifold m of dimension (m, n)
as an application:

4

 b (m)
 :d (m)  ...  d (m)
}
|

{z

p -times

such that:
i) is a b (m) p -linear i.e.

(2.10)

 (x1, ..., f xk, ...xp ) = (1)|f |(|xk1|...|xp |) f  (x1, ..., xk, ...xp )
ii) is a graded antisymmetric i.e.

(2.11)

 (x1, ..., xk, xk+1...xp ) = (1)1+|xk|.|xk+1|  (x1, ..., xk+1, xk, ...xp )

(2.12)
we reminid that the space of the p-superforms p (m) is a graded b-
module. if  is even (resp.odd) then:  (x1, ..., xp )  b (m) with |  |= 0
(resp. |  |= 1) .
the exterior product  of two p and p superforms  and  respectively
is dened by:

the exterior dierentiation is dened as an even linear application such that:

   = (1)pp+||.||   

(2.13)

d : p (m)  p +1 (m)

with

a)d ( + ) = d + d
b)d (  ) =   d + (1)p d  
c)d2 = 0

d)df =

dxa f
xa

m+npa=1

where f  0 (m) = b (m) and (cid:16)xa(cid:17) (cid:16)a = 1, m + n(cid:17) is a chart of the

m coordinates . locally,a p-superform can be expressed as:

 = pa1...ap

dxap  ...  dxa1a1...ap

(2.14)

now,the notion of a superber can be easily obtained by extending the
notion of a ber which necessites the denition of a lie supergroup. in fact,a
lie supergroup of dimension (m,n) is a set a such that:

5

i)the set a is an abstract group.
ii) the set a is a supermanifold of dimension (m,n) .
iii)the application 1 and 2 dened by:

1 : a  a  a
2 : a  a

(2.15)

where 2 (a) = a1, a  a and a1 is the inverse element of a. are superana-
lytic applications.
the innitesimal right or left translations are superdieomorph. thus,the
space of vectorial superelds which are left invariants constitutes a lie su-
peralgebra g of g i.e:

i) [xi, xj] = (1)1+|xi|.|xj| [xi, xj]
ii) [axi, xj] = a [xi, xj]

xi, xj  g.
xi, xj  g, a  b.
(1)|xi|.|xj| [[xi, xk] , xj] + (1)|xk|.|xi| [[xk, xj] , xi] +

iii)

+ (1)|xj|.|xk| [[xj, xi] , xk] = 0

xi, xj, xk  g

where [, ] is the graded lie braket. the homogeneous elementsnia, a = 1, m + no

constitute a basis of g. if there exists an element f c

ab of b such that:

(2.16)
ab |=| a | + | b | + | c | . the dual basis a of ia is given by

[ia, ib] = f c

abic

where | f c
the maurer-cartan equation:

da = 1

2b  c f a

cb

(2.17)

now,let g and m be a lie supergroup and supermanifold respectively. p (m,g)
is a principal superber with a total space p,basis m and a structural group
g over a supermanifold with a dimension dim (m)+dim (g) if:

i)g acts freely at the right over p:
ii)m a is quotient superspace p/g :the superdierentiable superprojection

 is dened by:

  m

iii)p is locally trivial.
a connection  in the principal superber p is an application which

associates to each point z  p, a tangent space tzp = hz.

3 brst and anti-brst transformations:

at the quantum level of nonsymmetric gravitation theory,the primary elds
are represented by the vierbein,connection and the ghosts related to the
general coordinates and the linear group ga (4, r) .

if we want to reproduce theses elds in the geometrical structure of the
superber bundle p(m,gs), one has to identify the basis m with the four
dimensional space-time whose metric is nonsymmetric and the structural
group gs with a lie supergroup allowing the introduction of the primary
elds via the superconnection. to be more specic,one has to consider a
structural group gs as:

gs = gl (4, r)  ga (4, r)  s0,2

(3.1)
where gl (4, r) , ga (4, r) and s0,2 represent the general,local linear groups
and the translation supergroup with dimension (0,2) respectively. thus,the
lie superalgebra gs of the structural group gs can be written as:

gs = gl (4, r)  ga (4, r)  s0,2
b, pa) and f(cid:16),  = 1, 4 ,a, b = 1, 4,  = 0, 2(cid:17) , cor-
with generators:t 
responding to gl (4, r) , ga (4, r) and s0,2 respectively and verifying the fol-
lowing graded lie superalgebra:

let  be the 2-form supercurvature associated to the superconnection  and
 an even pseudo-tensorial form of the type (ad, gs) (ad means adjoint
representation) dened on the principal superber bundle p (m, gs). notice

7

that the introduction of the 1-form  is an justied by the fact that the
imposed constraint on the supercurvature  can be obtained by the fact that
the covariant dierentiation of a pseudo-tensorial form is tensorial. now,if

we introduce a generalized superconnection e such that:
then the corresponding generalized supercurvature e gets the form:

with

and:

e =   
e = de =   
 = d = d  1

2 [, ]

(3.4)

(3.5)

 = d = d + [, ]

(3.6)

using the fact that the brst and anti-brst are global transformations,one
has to consider a principle superber bundle p (m, gs) which is globally
trivial with respect to odd supergroup s0,2 translations . if we dene z =
(cid:16)x m(cid:17)m =1,g  (x, )=1,4 =1,2 as a local coordinates system on p (m, gs),

then the generalized superconnection and supercurvature take the form:

e = dz mem = dz m (m  

m )

e = 1

2dz n  dz mem n = 1

2dz n  dz m (m n  m n )

(3.7)

(3.8)

and

with

m n = m n + (1)1+|z n |.|m | n m  [n  m ]
m n = m 

m | n 

n + (1)1+|z n |.|
where | z m |,| m |,| 

m respectively.

and 

m  {[n , 

m ] + (1)1+|n |.|

n | [m , 

n ]

(3.9)
m | stand for the grassman grade of z m , m

now as it is mentioned in section 2 and since 

 is a vertical supereld,

one deduce that :

i.e:

and:

 = 

e = e
(cid:16),  = 1, 2;  = 1, 4(cid:17)

 = 

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

moreover, and since the superelds components m , 

m , m n and m n

have their values on gs, one can write:

m = a

m = a
m n = a
m n = a

bm t b
bm n t b

from the relations (3.10)-(3.12)and (3.13) one obtains:

a



b = a
  =

a



b = a

(3.14)

furthermore,the generalized supertorsion e of s0,2 is given by:

m n = 

m n  

m n

where

and



m n = m 

m + (1)1+|z n |.|m | n

m n = m 

m + (1)1+|z n |.|m | n

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

from eqs.(3.14) and (3.15),the components of the supertortion e vanishes

with respect to the anticommuting directions. moreover, the potentials 
m associated to the odd generators f are of a pure gauge. therefore, one
can impose the condition:

consequently



m n = 0



 = 

 = 0

(3.18)

(3.19)

moreover,requiring that the geometrical structure of the principal super-
ber bundle p (m, gs) has to contain the metric structure of the nonsym-
metric space-time. m,such that for  = 0,the component of the super elds

e allow to obtain the standard results concerning the curvature and torsion

of the nonsymmetric space-time metric. consequently,one has to have:

and this implies that:

e = 

(3.20)



  = 

b = 

 = a

 = 0

(3.21)

using the condition(3.18),one can consider that the superconnection  has
its values on gl (4, r)  ga (4, r) algebras and its local representation takes
the form:

 = dz m m = dx + d

(3.22)

where

(3.23)

notice that,the superelds  have an odd grassman grade, therefore they
can represent the ghosts superelds.
in particular,the components of the
ghosts superelds evaluated at  = 0 will be the ghosts associated to the
general coordinates and local linear groups. thus we obtain:

a

  =

regarding,the superconnection , one can get the ordinary primary elds

of qngt as follows:

b = a
b = a

(3.25)
the anholonomic and holonomic components of the superconnection 

 and a

b are related by the supervierbein a

 as follows:



 = 

 + b

a

(3.26)

a(cid:16)a

b(cid:17)

consequently the relations (3.14) are not indepedents and the components 
  can be obtained from the components a
. note that,through
the relation (3.9) ,the knownledge of the  components allows to determine
the  components. for example,from the equations (3.19) and (3.21) ,one
has as trivial solutions:

b and a



 =

b = a

 =

(2.27)

b and

the determination of the other componentts of  such as

where d. = . + [, .] represents the covariant super derivative with
values on ga (4, r) . notice that the last relation (3.28) is a direct conse-
quence of the condition a

 = 0 (see eq. (3.24)).

to introduce explicitly the physical elds m

a represents the group index,we consider the development of the supereld
components a is powers  and end up to the following forms:

now,the action at the right on the principal superber bundle p (m, gs)

of odd translations of the group s0,2 can be written as:

r () : (x,  )  (x,   + )

(3.31)
let (q)=1,2 the operational representation of the generators f of s0,2. thus
the translation at the right r () is generated by q and for an innites-
imal displacement one can write:

r () = 1 + q

(3.32)

using the properties of the superconnection (3.22) and the relations (3.31)
and (3.32) ,we obtain:

m

a (x,  ) r1 ()

(3.33)

after straightforward simplications,the expression (3.33) gets the form:

regarding the gauge xing lagrangian lgf (including ghosts) one can
reproduce it form the geometrical structure of the superber bundle by as-
suming that it is represented by the is component  = 0 of a super lagrangian
lgf

lgf

s = 12 + 21 + 1212

(3.39)
since the superconnection  has its values in the lie algebra gl (4, r)

in the form:

lgf

s = lgf

(3.48)

the principal superber bundle formalism is used to give a suitable geomet-
rical interpretation to the quantized nonsymmetric gravity. we remark that
every superber bundle is also a ber bundle in such a way that the struc-
ture of the principal ber bundle is valuable not only for unquantized,but
also for the quantized gauge theory. the metric tensor and faddev-popov
elds appear as superelds which are coecients of a particular kind of con-
nections in the superber bundle-soul at connections coming from the usual
connections in the principal ber bundle describing the unquantized theory.
the brst and anti-brst transformations are acting over a given connec-
tion,through gauge transformations,in the superber bundle,of parameters
the ghost and anti-ghost superelds respectively,which appear in the partic-
ular connection on which they act. for the case of soul-at connections the
brst and anti-brst transformations are also translations along the anti-
commuting variables which act in the base supermanifold. moreover they
generate an s0,2 supergroup.
