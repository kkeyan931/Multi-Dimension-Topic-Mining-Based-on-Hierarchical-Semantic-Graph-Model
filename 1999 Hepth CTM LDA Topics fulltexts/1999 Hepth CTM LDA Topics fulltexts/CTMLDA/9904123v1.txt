abstract

we present a new topological tensor current of p-branes by making use of

the -mapping theory. it is shown that the current is identically conserved and

behave as (~), and every isolated zero of the vector eld ~(x) corresponds to

a magnetic p-brane. using this topological current, the generalized nambu

action for multi p-branes is given, and the eld strength f corresponding to

this topological tensor current is obtained. it is also shown that the magnetic

charges carried by p-branes are topologically quantized and labeled by hopf

index and brouwer degree, the winding number of the -mapping.

i. introduction

extended objects with p spatial dimensional, known as branes, play an essential role in

revealing the non-perturbative structure of the superstring theories and m-theories [14].

antisymmetric tensor gauge elds have been widely studied in the theories of p-branes

[57]. in the context of the eective d = 10 or d = 11 supergravity theory a p-brane is

a p-dimensional extended source for a (p + 2)-form gauge eld strength f. it is well-known

that the (p + 2)-form strength f satises the eld equation

f 1 p+1 = j1 p+1

where j1 p+1is a (p + 1)-form tensor current and corresponding to electric source, and the

dual eld strength f satises

f 1  p+1 = j1  p+1



in which j1  p+1 is a (p + 1)-form tensor current and corresponding to magnetic source [8]

[9] [10].

the -mapping theory proposed by prof. duan [11,12] is important in studying the

topological invariant and topological structure of physics systems and has been used to study

topological current of magnetic monopole [11], topological string theory [12], topological

structure of gauss-bonnet-chern theorem [13], topological structure of the su(2) chern

density [14] and topological structure of the london equation in superconductor [15]. we

must pointed out that the -mapping theory is also a powerful tools to investigate the

topological defects theory [1618], and here the vector eld ~ is looked upon as the order

parameters of the defects.

in this paper, we present a new topological tensor current of magnetic p-branes by

making use of the -mapping theory. one shows that the each isolated zero of the d-
dimensional vector eld ~(x) corresponds to a p-brane(p = d  d  1), and this current is
proved to be the general current density of multi p-branes. using this current, the generalized

nambu action for multi p-branes is obtained. this topological tensor current will give rise

to the inner structure of the eld strength f including the contribution of the magnetic

p-branes. finally, we show that the charges carried by multi p-branes are topologically

quantized and labeled by the hopf index and brouwer degree, the winding number of the

-mapping.

ii. the topological tensor current of p -branes

let x be a d-dimensional smooth manifold with metric tensor g and local coordinates
x(,  = 0,   , d  1) with x0 = t as time, and let rd be an euclidean space of dimension

2

d < d. we consider a smooth map  : x  rd , which gives a d-dimensional smooth vector
eld on x

a = a(x),

a = 1, 2,   , d.

the direction unit eld of ~(x) can be expressed as

na =

,

a
||||

|||| = qaa.

(1)

(2)

in the -mapping theory, to extend the theory of magnetic monopoles [11] and the topological

string theory [12], we present a new topological tensor current, with the unit magnetic

charge gm, dened as

j1 dd =

gm

a(sd1)(d  1)!

(

1
g

) 1 dddd+1dd+2 d

a1a2 ad (dd+1)na1(dd2)na2    d nad

(3)

where g is the determinant of the metric tensor g. obviously, this magnetic tensor current

is identically conserved,

from (2) we have

j1 dd = 0,

1

i = 1,   , d  d.

na =

1
||||

a + a(

)

1
||||


a (

1
||||

) = 

a
||||3

using the above expressions, the general tensor current can be rewritten as

j1 dd =

gm

a(sd1)(d  1)!(d  2)

(

1
g

) 1 dddd+1 d  a1 ad

(dd+1)a(dd2)a2    d ad


a



a1

(

1

||||d2 ).

if we dene a generalized jacobians tensor as

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

a1 ad j 1 dd(


x

) =1 dddd+1dd+2 d (dd+1)a1(dd2)a2    d ad

(8)

and make use of the generalized laplacian green function relation in -space


a


a (

1

||||d2 ) =

d
2

4

(d/2  1)

(~),

we obtain a -function like tensor current [12]

j1 dd = gm(~)j 1 dd(


x

)(

1
g

).

(9)

(10)

we nd that j1 dd 6= 0 only when  = 0. so, it is essential to discuss the solutions of
the equations

a(x) = 0,

a = 1,   , d

(11)

suppose that the vector eld ~(x) possesses l isolated zeroes, according to the deduction

of ref. [12] and the implicit function theorem [19] [20], when the zeroes are regular points

of -mapping, i.e. the rank of the jacobian matrix [a] is d, the solution of ~(x) = 0 can

be parameterized by

x = z

i (u1, u2,   , udd),

i = 1,   , l,

(12)

where the subscript i represents the i-th solution and the parameters u = u(u1,   , udd)
span a (d  d)-dimensional submanifold of x, denoted by ni, which corresponds to a
p-brane(p = d  d  1) with spatial p-dimension and ni is its worldvolume. one see
that the tensor current j1 dd is not vanished only on the worldvolume manifolds ni
(i = 1,   , l), each of which corresponds to a p-brane. therefore, every isolated zero of ~(x)
on x corresponds to a magnetic p-branes. these magnetic p-branes had been formally

discussed and not studied based on the topology theory [22,23]. here, we must pointed out

that the p-branes, sometimes, may be considered as topological defects [10,24], in this case

for our theory the vector eld a(x) (a = 1,   , d) may be looked upon as the generalized
order parameters [18] for p-branes.

4

in the following, we will discuss the inner structure of the topological tensor current

j1 dd. it can be proved that there exists a d-dimensional submanifold m in x with the

parametric equation

x = x(v1,   , vd),  = 1,   , d,

which is transversal to every ni at the point pi with

g

x
ui

xv
va|pi = 0,

i = 1,   , d  d, a = 1,   , d.

(13)

(14)

this is to say that the equations ~(x) = 0 have the isolated zero points on m.

as we have pointed in ref. [13,14], the unit vector eld dened in (2) gives a gauss map

n : mi  sd1, and the generalized winding number can be given by this gauss map

wi =

=

=

1

1

1

n(a1 ad na1dna2      dnad)

a(sd1)(d  1)! zmi
a(sd1)(d  1)! zmi a1 ad na1a2na2    adnaddva2      dvad
a(sd1)(d  1)! zmi a1 ada1 ad a1na1a2na2    adnadddv.

(15)

where mi is the boundary of the neighborhood mi of pi on m with pi / mi, mi mj = .
then, by duplicating the derivation of (3) from (10), we obtain

wi = zmi

(~(v))j(


v

)ddv

where j( 

v ) is the usual jacobian determinant of ~ with respect to v

a1 ad j(


v

) =a1 ad a1na1a2na2    adnad.

(16)

(17)

according to the -function theory [25] and the -mapping theory, we know that (~(v))

can be expanded as

(~(v)) =

l

xi=1

iid(~v  ~v(pi))

(18)

5

on m, where the positive integer i = |wi| is called the hopf index of the map v  ~(v) and
i = sgn(j( 
v ))|pi = 1 is the brouwer degree [13,15]. one can nd the relation between

the hopf index i, the brouwer degree i, and the winding number wi

wi = ii,

(19)

one see that the eq. (18) is only the expansion of (~(x)) on m. in order to investigate the

expansion of (~(x)) on the whole manifold x, we must expand the d-dimensional -function

of the singular point in terms of the -function on the singular submanifold ni which had

been given in ref. [25]

(ni) = zni

d(x  zi(u))gud(dd)u,

i = 1,   , l

in which

gu = det(g

x
ui

x
uj ),

i, j = 1,   , (d  d).

(20)

then, from eqs. (18), and by considering the property of the -function, one will obtain

(~(x)) =

l

xi=1

iizni

d(x  zi(u))gud(dd)u.

therefore, the general topological current of the p-branes can be expressed directly as

j1 dd = (

1
g

)j 1 dd(


x

)

l

xi=1

iizni

d(x  zi(u))gud(dd)u,

which is a new topological current theory of p-branes based on the -mapping theory.

if we dene a lagrangian as

l = s 1

(d  d)!

g11    g(dd)(dd)

j1 ddj1 dd,

(21)

(22)

(23)

which is just the generalization of nielsens lagrangian [26], from the above deductions, we

can prove that

l = (

1
g

)(~(x)).

6

(24)

then, the action takes the form

s = zx

lgddx = zx

(~(x))ddx.

by substituting the formula (21) into (25), we obtain an important result

s = zx

l

xi=1

iizni

d(x  zi(u))gud(dd)uddx

i.e.

=

l

xi=1

iizni

gud(dd)u,

l

(25)

(26)

(27)

s =

isi,

xi=1

where si = irni gud(dd)u. this is just the generalized nambu action for multi p-
branes(p = d  d  1), which is the straightforward generalization of nambu action for
the string world-sheet action [27]. here this action for multi p-branes is obtained directly by

-mapping theory, and it is easy to see that this action is just nambu action for multi-strings

when d  d = 2 [12].

iii. the gauge field corresponding to the topological

current

in this section, we will study the antisymmetric tensor gauge eld corresponding to the

topological tensor current presented in above section. we know that p-branes naturally acts

as the electric source of a rank p + 2 eld strength

f = da,

(28)

where a is a (p+1)-form as the tensor gauge potential and satises the gauge transformation

a  a + dp.

from eq. (28), one have the bianchi identity

7

and the electric current density associated with the source can be expressed as

df  0.

j1 p+1 = f 1 p+1.

(29)

(30)

just as the usual maxwells equation, we know that eqs. (28), (29) and (30) imply the

presence of an electric charge, i.e. p-branes, but no magnetic source [10].

now, let us discuss the case when there exists the magnetic source. for this case, one

must introduce another (p + 2)-form g for the magnetic source, and the eld strength f

must be modied to

f = da + g,

(31)

which is the generalized eld strength including the contribution of the magnetic source,

i.e. magnetic branes: p-branes with p = d  p  4.

to obtain the explicit expression for g, let us consider the current density corresponds

to magnetic source which is given by

j1  p+1 = 

f 1  p+1.

using (31) and (32), we obtain

j1 ( p+1) =

1
g

(g1  p+1 p+2 d1

g

g p+2 d1),

(32)

(33)

it has been pointed out in the above section that the current density of the magnetic branes

is a topological current given by eq. (3), which can be rewritten as

j1 dd =

gm

a(sd1)(d  1)!

(

1
g

)(dd+1)(1 dddd+1dd+2 d

a1a2 ad na1(dd2)na2    d nad)

(34)

where (d  d) = p + 1, i.e. p = d  d  1. comparing the eq. (33) to (34), we can obtain

g1 d1 =

(1)(dd)gm
a(sd1)(d  1)! a1a2 ad na11na2    d1nad,

(35)

8

and

g =

(1)(dd)gm
a(sd1)(d  1)! a1a2 ad na1dna2      dnad.

(36)

of equal interest is the magnetic charge carried by the multi p-branes, which is given

by

qm = z

j1  p+1gd1  p+1

(37)

where  is a d-dimension(d = p + 3) hypersurface in x, while d1  p+1is the convariant

surface element of  [28]. from (32) and (37), it is easy to prove that

qm = z

f,

where  is the boundary of  and a (p + 2)-dimension hypersurface. substituting (22) into

(37), we have

qm = gmz

j 1  p+1(


x

)

l

xi=1

iizni

d(x  zi(u))gud(dd)ud1  p+1,

(38)

from (8), and the relation

1

(p + 1)! 1  p+11 d d1  p+1 = dx1      dxd,

the expression (38) can be rewritten as

qm = g0z()

l

xi=1

iizni

1
g

d(x  zi(u))gud(dd)ud(d).

since on the singular submanifold ni we have

a(x)|ni = a(z1

i (u),   , zd

i (u))  0,

which leads to

a x

ui |ni = 0.

using this expression, one can prove

9

(39)

(40)

(41)

j 1 dd(


x

)|~=0 =

g
gu i1 i(dd)

x1
ui1   

x(dd)
ui(dd)

.

then we obtain an useful formula

d(d)gud(dd)u = gddx.

by making use of the above formula and (39), we nally get

qm = gm

l

xi=1

iizx

d(x  zi(u))ddx = gm

ii.

l

xi=1

(42)

(43)

(44)

the above expression shows that the i-th brane carries the magnetic charge qm

i = gmii =

gmwi, which is topologically quantized and characterized by hopf index i and brouwer

degree i, the winding number wi of the -mapping.

iv. conclusion

in this paper the -mapping theory is introduced to study the p-branes theory, which

is development of our former theories of magnetic monopoles and topological strings. we

present a new topological tensor current of magnetic multi p-branes and discuss the inner

structure of this current in detail. it is shown that every isolated zero of the vector eld ~

(i.e. order parameters) is just corresponding to a magnetic brane, p-brane(p = d  d  1).
the generalized nambu action for multi p-branes can be obtained directly in terms of this

topological current. the topological structure of the charges carried by p-branes shows that

the magnetic charges is topologically quantized and labeled by the hopf index and brouwer

degree, the winding number of the -mapping. the theory formulated in this paper is a new

concept for topological p-branes based on the -mapping theory.
