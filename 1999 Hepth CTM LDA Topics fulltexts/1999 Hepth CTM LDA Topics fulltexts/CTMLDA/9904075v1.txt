abstract

it is shown that a large class of higher-order (i.e. non-quadratic)
scalar kinetic terms can, without the help of potential terms, drive an
inationary evolution starting from rather generic initial conditions.
in many models, this kinetically driven ination (or k-ination for
short) rolls slowly from a high-curvature initial phase, down to a
low-curvature phase and can exit ination to end up being radiation-
dominated, in a naturally graceful manner. we hope that this novel
ination mechanism might be useful in suggesting new ways of recon-
ciling the string dilaton with ination.

introduction

the inationary paradigm [1] oers the attractive possibility of resolving
many of the puzzles of standard hot big bang cosmology. the crucial in-
gredient of most successful inationary scenarios is a period of slow-roll
evolution of a scalar eld  (the inaton), during which the potential en-
ergy v () stored in  dominates its kinetic energy 2/2 and drives a quasi-
exponential expansion of the universe. at present there exists no preferred
concrete inationary scenario based on a convincing realistic particle physics
model.
in particular, though string theory provides one with several very
weakly coupled scalar elds (the moduli), which could be natural inaton
candidates, their non-perturbative potentials v () do not seem t to sus-
tain slow-roll ination because, for large values of , they tend either to
grow, or to tend to zero, too fast. it is therefore important to explore novel
possibilities for implementing an inationary evolution of the early universe.

1

the aim of this work is to point out that, even in absence of any potential
energy term, a general class of non-standard (i.e. non-quadratic) kinetic-
energy terms l( ), for a scalar eld , can drive an inationary evolution
of the same type as the usually considered potential driven ination. by
usual type of ination we mean here an accelerated expansion (in the
einstein conformal frame) during which the curvature scale starts around a
planckian value and then decreases monotonously. by contrast, the pre-big
bang scenario [2] uses a standard (quadratic) kinetic-energy term 2/2 to
drive an accelerated contraction (in the einstein frame) during which the
curvature scale increases. though we shall motivate below the consideration
of non-standard kinetic terms by appealing to the existence, in string theory,
of higher-order corrections to the eective action for , we do not claim that
the structure needed for implementing our kinetically driven ination arises
inevitably in string theory. the aim of this work is more modest. we draw
attention to a new mechanism for implementing ination. a large class of the
(toy) models we shall consider satisfy two of the most crucial requirements of
inationary scenarios: (i) the scalar perturbations are well-behaved during
the inationary stage, and (ii) there exist natural mechanisms for exiting
ination in a graceful manner. we leave to future work a more detailed
analysis of the observational consequences of our kinetically driven ination
(spectrum of scalar and tensor perturbations, reheating, . . . ). we hope that,
by enlarging the basic tool-kit of inationary cosmology, our mechanism
could help to locate which sector of string-theory (if any) has inated a
strongly curved initial state into our presently observed large and weakly
curved universe.

ii general model

we consider a single scalar eld  interacting with gravity through non-
standard kinetic terms,

s = z d4xg(cid:20)

r

62 + p(,)(cid:21) .

(2.1)

here, 2  8g/3 and we use the signature (+  ). for simplicity, we
only consider lagrangians p which are local functions of  and therefore,
depend only on the scalar

x 

()2.

(2.2)

2

as we bar here the consideration of potential terms, we must impose that
the function p(, x) vanish when x  0. near x = 0, a generic kinetic

2

lagrangian p(, x) is expected to admit an expansion of the form

p(, x) = k()x + l()x 2 +    .

(2.3)

one of the possible particle theory motivations for taking this kind of la-
grangian seriously could be the following. let us consider only gravity and
some moduli eld  (which could be the dilaton, or some other moduli) in
string theory. it is well-known that  corrections (due to the massive modes
of the string) generate a series of higher-derivative terms in the low-energy
eective action se, while string-loop corrections generate a non-trivial mod-
uli dependence of the coecients of the various kinetic terms. this leads to
a structure of the type (in the string frame g)

se =

(2.4)

where the ellipsis stands for other four-derivative terms (like (2)2, r2
in the case where  is the dilaton the coupling functions are of the form

, . . .).

bg() = e + cg,0 + cg,1e +    ,
b(0)
 () = e + c,0 + c,1e +    ,
b(1)
 () = e +    ,

string = e, including non-
where the ellipsis contain higher contributions in g2
perturbative ones. transforming eq.
(2.4) to the einstein frame g =
bg()g, and neglecting the other possible four derivative terms in eq. (2.4),
leads to the eective action (2.1) with -kinetic terms of the form (2.3) where

k() = 3

in the case where  is the dilaton (so that gs = e/2 is the string coupling), we
have, in the weak-coupling limit g2

order of unity it is not a priori excluded that k() and l() could become
more complicated functions of . we shall give below some examples of such
possible complicated behaviours.

in this work we shall only consider solutions of eqs. (2.11)-(2.14) which
describe an expanding universe (in einstein frame), that is h > 0. this
reduces the evolution equations (2.11), (2.12) to the master equation

(2.15)
here, and in the following, we use units such that 2  8g/3 = 1. note
that, from eq. (2.11),  was constrained to be positive.

iii kinetically driven ination - basic idea

2()2, and not on : p = p(x). from eq.

as a warm up, let us rst consider the case where the lagrangian p depends
only on x = 1
(2.9), the
in
energy-density depends also only on x: (x) = 2xp/x  p(x).
hydrodynamical language it means that we have here an isentropic uid,
with a general equation of state relating p to : p = f (). the master
evolution equation can then be qualitatively solved by looking at the graph
of the equation of state p = f (). the shape of this graph depends very
much on the shape of the function p = p(x), or better, on the shape of the
function p = p() where   , so that x = 1
 = p/  p

22. indeed, the relation

(3.1)

shows that  can be read geometrically o the graph p = p(). more precisely
 is the interceptof the tangent to the curve p = p() at the point , i.e.
its intersection with the vertical axis  = 0. the minus sign means that  is
positive (negative) if the tangent intersects the vertical axis below (above) the
p = 0 horizontal axis. therefore, if the function p() = 1
4l4 +   
is, for instance, always convex, 2p/2 > 0, as will be the case if all the
coecients k, l, . . . appearing in the expansion (2.3) are positive, p and
 will be always positive.
(2.15) shows that  will
monotonically decrease towards zero, and the evolution will be driven to the
attracting solution

in such a case, eq.

2k2 + 1

 = h 2

9t2

,

a  a0 t1/3.

(3.2)

this attractor corresponds to the asymptotic equation of state p   valid
near  = 0 where the usual kinetic term p  1
2k2 dominates. on the other
hand, if the function p() is non-convex and has some oscillatory behaviour
as  increases (i.e., if we consider the general case where the expansion
coecients k, l, . . . in eq. (2.3) may take negative values) the graph p =
f () can be more complicated and can allow for exponential-type inationary
behaviour. let us rst note that, because of eq. (3.1), the extrema of the
function p = p() (or p = p(x)) correspond to values where p = , i.e. to
xed points of the master evolution equation (2.15). for a general function
p = p(x) the graph of the (multiform) equation of state might resemble
fig.1.

from the master eq. (2.15) it follows that  will decrease above the line
p = , and increase below it. fig. 1 then shows that all the intersection
points with the p =  line are attractors of the (future) evolution. the

figure 1: graph of the equation of state linking p to  for an hypothetical
general kinetic lagrangian p( ). the evolution for expanding, at cosmolo-
gies proceeds along the indicated arrows. the shaded region ( < 0) is
excluded. except for the origin and the point above it on the vertical axis,
the attractors of the evolution are inationary xed points with p = .

arrows in fig. 1 indicate the evolutive ow, which reverses (along the graph)
at the extrema of . the region where  < 0 is excluded because it cannot
be reached by at cosmologies (see eq. (2.11)). the xed points lying at the
p =  line correspond to an exponential ination

aatt(t) = a0 exp (xedt)

(3.3)

apart from these inationary attractors, there are two other attractors (in
the case depicted in fig. 1): (i) the origin, where the evolution is driven
toward the solution (3.2) (corresponding to the hard equation of state
p = ), and (ii) the point above the origin on the vertical axis. as we will
see later the latter point lies in the region of absolute instability and has
therefore no physical signicance.

e
in this work we shall focus on the inationary attractors (3.3) because
they exhibit the novel possibility of getting, for a large set of initial conditions,
quasi-exponential (or power law) ination out of a purely kinetic lagrangian.
note that the condition for the existence of these inationary attractors can
also be seen in eq. (2.14). in absence of a  dependence, eq. (2.14) says
that a3 is constant so that  is attracted toward zero. as the momentum
 = p/  =  p/x, we see that non trivial (  6= 0) attractors can
exist if the kinetic terms are non-standard so that p/x can vanish for non
zero values of
 . the extremal values of p correspond to the inationary
attractors discussed above.

the labels s and u in fig. 1 (which stand for stable and unstable)
indicate whether, for our present isentropic equation of state p = f (), the
squared speed of sound c2
s = dp/d is positive or negative, respectively. this
issue will be further discussed below.

note that the price to pay for having inationary attractors as in fig.
1 is the existence of regions, in phase space (, ), with negative energy
density. we shall assume in this work that this is not physically forbidden.
all the cosmological evolutions that we shall consider below stay always in
the positive energy regions, and the existence, elsewhere in phase space, of
negative  regions does not necessarily cause some instabilities along our
evolutionary tracks.

the simple case of a kinetic lagrangian depending only on  considered
above is the analog, for kinetically driven ination (or k -ination for short),
of a de sitter model with constant energy density.
it is clear that both
models should have similar problems. namely, there is no natural graceful
exit, no smooth transition to a friedmann universe and the cosmological
perturbations are ill-dened. to avoid these problems we should allow the
coecients in the expansion (2.3) of the lagrangian p to depend on the scalar
eld .

iv slow-roll k -ination

the simplest way to realize successfully the idea of k -ination is to consider
the analog of slow-roll potential driven ination, in which the potential
v () in the lagrangian l(, ) = 1
2 2  v () dominates the kinetic term
2/2 and evolves slowly. for the concept of k -ination to have a relevance
to a large class of models, we need to consider a general kinetic lagrangian
p(, x). the idea is therefore to nd the conditions under which the inuence
of the non-trivial  dependence of p(, x) will represent only a relatively
small perturbation of the attraction toward exponential ination discussed

7

in section iii. to do that in a concrete manner it is convenient to focus
henceforth on the simplest kinetic lagrangian, containing only 2 and 4
terms, namely

p(, x) = k()x + l()x 2 =

1
2

k()()2 +

1
4

l()()4.

(4.1)

let us rst motivate the possibility of rather arbitrary functions k(), l()
by considering again the low-energy eective action of string theory (2.4). as
we mentioned above, in the weak coupling limit k()  1 and l()  e.
however, when gs becomes of order unity it is not a priori excluded that
k() could change sign. for instance we could consider a simple model (of
the type considered in refs. [3], [4]), where the coupling functions b() in
the action (2.4) are the same, that is bg() = b(0)
 () = b(). in
this model

 () = b(1)

b()(cid:19)2
k() = 3(cid:18)b ()

 2

(4.2)

might become negative when gs reaches values of order unity. in fact a model,
incorporating string loop corrections, considered in ref. [5] has

k() = 1  3k e 6 + k e
(3 + k e)2 ,

(4.3)

where k = 3gs/82 is a positive parameter. the r.h.s. of eq. (4.3) be-

comes negative when e > 3(6  2)/2k. motivated by these examples, we

shall assume, as simplest toy model exhibiting interesting dynamics, a la-
grangian of the form (4.1) with a function k() which is positive in some
range of values of  (weak-coupling-domain) and becomes negative in some
other range (strong-coupling-domain). on the other hand, to ensure the
positivity of  for large eld gradients x, we shall assume that the function
l() remains always positive.

the equation of state in the model (4.1) is parametrically given by

p = k()x + l()x 2,
 = k()x + 3l()x 2.

(4.4)
(4.5)

we represent in fig. 2 the change in the form of the equation of state
p = f (, ) as  varies from the weak-coupling region (k > 0) to the strong-
coupling one (k < 0). note that for large values of x, the equation of state
asymptotes the one of radiation (p = /3), while it is tangent to the hard
equation of state (p = ; with sgn() = sgn(k)) when x  0. in the strong
coupling domain there appears (in the adiabatic approximation where  is
treated as constant) an inationary xed point where pxed = xed.

8

let us investigate under what conditions on the functions k() and l()
one can indeed approximately solve the master evolution equation (2.15) by
considering that the variation of  brings only a small perturbation onto
the simple -independent evolution studied above. we shall simplify this
study by redening the scalar eld and working with the new eld variable

new = r doldl1/4(old) (which is well dened because we assume l() > 0).
with this denition lnew(new) = 1 and knew(new) = kold(old)/l1/2
old (old).
in other words, we can assume, without loss of generality, that l() = 1.
with this simplication the zeroth-order slow-roll, or adiabatic, solution
to eq.
(2.15)
(solution of 0 =  + p = 2xp/x) corresponds to

the instantaneous attractive xed point of eq.

tion for potential driven ination. examples of functions k() that satisfy
this condition are: (i) any power law or exponential (or super-exponential)
growth as   , (ii) any levelling o of k() (k()  limit, with k
() 
0) as   , or (iii) a suciently fast pole-like growth of k()  (),
with  > 2, as   .

note that during slow-roll k -ination the following useful relation

(4.15)

is satised, that is, the fractional compensation of the energy density by the
negative pressure is proportional to the small parameter x/xsr. therefore,
in those models where  + p > 0, or equivalently, the energy density decreases
in the course of expansion, x is positive. it is also obvious from (4.15), that
ination ends when x/xsr becomes of the order of unity, i.e. when the
slow-roll condition (4.14) is violated.

for any function k() (and more generally for any p(, x)) satisfying
the slow-roll criterion we can visualize our k -inationary behaviour as being
one point (i.e. one value of x = xsr + x) on an adiabatically varying
equation of state graph of the type of figs. 1 or 2. [the adiabatic variation
we mention corresponding to the fact that each graph corresponds to some
specic, instantaneous value of  , which is itself evolving]. eq. (4.13) (or its
generalization to a generic p(, x)) then tells us that the point x = xsr +x
is always displaced away from the intersections of the (-instantaneous) graph
with the p =  line.
overall, the qualitative behaviour of the solutions we are focussing on
is the following: initially, we start with some representative point in the
(, p) plane lying on an equation of state graph corresponding to some initial
value of , deep into the strong coupling domain. we assume that, for strong
coupling, the slow-roll criterion is very well satised. in a rst evolution stage,
we can neglect the -dependence of the equation of state because there is a
fast attraction taking just a few e-folds of the representative point toward
the nearest inationary attractor (this stage is described by the arrows in
fig. 1). after this initial stage, we can consider that our representative
point follows the (post-) slow-roll motion x = xsr + x, corresponding to
a representative point near but away from the p =  line (such a point is
indicated in fig. 2). as the evolution continues, the slow-roll condition is
less and less well satised and the representative point straggles more and
more away from the p =  line. at some point in the evolution the slow-roll
criterion (4.14) becomes violated (x/x  1) and one naturally exits the
inationary stage. we shall come back later to this exit mechanism.
the qualitative picture of the evolution just represented (based on a suc-
cession of graphs in the (, p) plane) can also be globally visualized by a
phase-space picture in the (, ) plane (see fig. 3). slow-roll ination on
this graph corresponds to the portion of the separatrix (attractor) given by

 = qk (cid:18)1 +

x

(4.16)

where x/x  1. when x/x becomes of the order of one a graceful exit
from ination takes place, see section vii. the phase diagram fig. 3 is

approach the attractor but do not reach the line  + p = 0 where the speed of
sound vanishes. around the point where the slow-roll condition is violated,
the solutions leave the inationary stage and approach then smoothly the
vacuum  = 0.

very similar to the one of potential driven slow-roll ination [9]. we see that
the set of initial congurations of the scalar eld which lead to ination has
nonzero measure. therefore the problem of initial conditions here is very
similar to what one has in the case of chaotic ination [1]. we expect that
in analogy to the other models of ination self-reproduction of the universe
[10] can take place in our k-inationary model. however this question needs
a special investigation and we leave it to future work.

let us also mention that one can easily build a model in which one starts
initially in the weak coupling regime, with the eld  evolving towards the
strong coupling regime. the function k can then be arranged in such a way
that the universe leaves the weak coupling regime to enter an inationary
stage and nally exits ination.

v power law k -ination

it is well known that, in the usual potential driven inationary scenario, if the
potential depends exponentially on the scalar eld, there exists an attractor

12

j
solution which describes a power law inating universe (see for instance
[11]). there is no graceful exit from ination if the potential is exponential
everywhere. therefore to solve the graceful exit problem one should assume
that the exponential potential is a valid approximation of a more realistic
and complicated potential only within some limited range of values of the
scalar eld . as we show in this section, one can get an analogous power
law k -ination within the class of models which we consider in this paper.

let us again consider the model with the lagrangian (4.1). for the
purposes of this section it is convenient to make a new eld redenition
(valid only in the region where k < 0) and rewrite the lagrangian (4.1)

in terms of the new eld variable new = r pl(old)/|k(old)| dold. this

yields

p = f ()(cid:0)x + x 2(cid:1) ,

(5.1)

where f ()  f (new) = k 2(old)/l(old) and x  x new = (l/|k|)x old.
working with this lagrangian one can try to nd out whether there is
a function f () for which the master equation (2.15) has an exact solution
which describes power law ination. in the case of power law ination

 + p = ,

(5.2)

where  is a constant. substituting  and p into the last equation we nd
immediately that if a solution exists, then

x = x0 =

2  
4  3

= const.

(5.3)

expressing  in terms of p from (5.2) and substituting (5.1) with x given
by (5.3) into the master eq. (2.15), we get a simple equation for f , which is
solved by

f () =

4
9

(4  3)

2

1

(  )2 .

(5.4)

therefore, a model with lagrangian (5.1), with f () given by eq. (5.4), has
an attractor solution which describes power law expansion,

a (t)  t

2

3 .

(5.5)

if 0 <  < 2/3 then this solution describes the usual power law ination. if
one takes a negative value of  then one gets pole-like super-ination in ein-
stein frame. however, this pole-like ination has a graceful exit problem
which is very similar to the one of the pre-big bang scenario [2]. we were
unable to nd a simple solution to this problem and we doubt that such a

13

solution can be meaningfully discussed within the eective eld lagrangian
formalism considered here. therefore we think that pole-like ination does
not help toward bringing a solution of the main cosmological problems. in
distinction from pole-like ination, in the model of power law ination the
graceful exit problem can be easily solved if in some range of  the function
f is modied in an obvious way.

a natural generalization of the lagrangian (5.1),

p = f () g (x) ,

vi stability

a detailed study of the spectrum of quantum perturbations in our slow-
roll k -ination scenario will be done in a forthcoming publication. we shall
only discuss here a necessary condition for the stability of our models with
respect to arbitrary, high-frequency scalar perturbations. the equation for
the canonical quantization variable v describing the collective metric and
scalar eld perturbations in the case of the action (2.1) can be written down
in the standard way [6] and takes the form [12]

v   c2

v = 0,

(6.1)

where the only relevant piece of information for our stability analysis is the
appearance of the speed of sound

p,x + 2xp,xx

(6.2)

in front of the laplacian. here a comma denotes a partial derivative with
respect to x. it is clear that if c2
s is negative then the model is absolutely

14

unstable. the increment of instability is inversely proportional to the wave-
length of the perturbations, and therefore the background models for which
c2
s < 0 are violently unstable and do not have any physical signicance.

this stability requirement (c2

s = p,x/,x > 0) is non trivial within our
scenario, because, for instance, in slow-roll k -ination in the zeroth-order
slow-roll approximation the inationary attractors are dened by p,x = 0,
and therefore c2
s = 0. however, as discussed in section iv, in the post-slow-
roll approximation, with x = xsr + x, p,x does not vanish. to rst order
in x we can write p,x  psr
,xxx. using the second equation (6.2) we get

c2
s 

x
2xsr

.

(6.3)

therefore stability requires that x > 0, i.e. that on the equation of state
graphs of figs. 1 and 2, the -gradients of p(, x) be such that they displace
the real, non-adiabatic, slow-roll attractor beyond the p =  line (beyond
meaning here further away as one runs along the p = f (, ) graph fol-
lowing the natural x parametrization). these stable stretches of the (, p)
graphs are labelled s in fig. 1. they are also the stretches where the slope
(dp/d) is positive (as is clear from eq. (6.2) which says that the velocity of
sound is given by the usual formula c2

s = dp/d, when keeping  xed).

let us now discuss the simple model (4.1). for this model we have com-
puted x/xsr, and we can therefore assess under what conditions k -ination
will be stable under scalar perturbations. we see from eq. (4.13) that the
conditions can be expressed in two (equivalent) forms: (i) the energy density

 = k must decrease during the slow-roll of , or (ii) k , = k, must
be positive. the satisfaction of this condition is very natural within the intu-
itive picture we have in mind: namely, starting at some high ( planckian)
energy density, i.e. a large negative value of k() = 2, and then letting
 evolve toward the weak-eld coupling domain where k() vanishes before
becoming positive. during the slow-roll phase (with k() < 0), it is natural
(and even necessary if k() is monotonic) to have a decreasing k = k.
one consequence applicable to a general model p(, x) is that slow-roll
implies a small value |c2
s|  1. it is interesting to ask for which (non slow-
roll) models one can have both a continued k -ination and a constant speed
of sound of order unity. let us consider for that purpose power law ination.
in the case where the lagrangian takes the form (5.1) the speed of sound
during the inationary stage is

c2
s =

.

(6.4)

if we restrict ourselves to the inationary range 0 <  < 2/3 this speed can
not exceed c2
s = 1/9. the smaller values of  correspond to very fast (nearly



8  3

15

exponential) expansion and small speed of sound in complete agreement with
our analysis of slow-roll k -ination. pole-like ination is violently unstable
in this model.

however, if we consider more general lagrangians (5.6) we can avoid these
restrictions. actually in this case the speed of sound during the inationary
stage is given by the expression

c2
s =

g,x (x0)

g,x (x0) + 2x0 g,xx (x0)

,

(6.5)

where x0 is the solution of equation (5.8). the necessary conditions for
power law ination given in section v imply that g,x (x0) 6= 0 and do not
involve any restrictions on the second derivative g,xx (x0). therefore, for a
power law inationary stage with any a priori given value of the parameter ,
one can always nd a corresponding function g (x) to arrange any required
speed of sound. note that it follows from here that one can also easily
build a theory with pole-like ination which is stable with respect to scalar
perturbations.

vii exit mechanisms

in the simple model of section iv (and in the normalization l() = 1) the
total number of inationary e-folds is (considering for deniteness that 
decreases during slow-roll)

ninf =

in

end

qk() d.

(7.1)

here in is the initial value of , and end the end of slow-roll, i.e. the value
of  where x/x becomes of order unity, i.e. (from eq. (4.13)), such that

3/2

(end)k

(end)  1.

(7.2)

we shall not investigate here the problem of the choice of initial conditions
within our model. we shall assume that some large parameter is present (or
at least possible) in the problem and allows ninf to be larger that 60 or so.
[one simple possibility would be a function k() of the type of eq. (4.3)
which levels o to a negative constant when  increases. all the couples
(, x) where x  1 (in planck units) and  is arbitrary large lead to an
energy density of order 1. a random initial condition with (in, xin)  1
could have an arbitrary large .] assuming this we note not only that our

16

mechanism contains a natural exit from ination (because of the evolution of
k and its nal change of sign), but that this exit is generically expected to
take place within a small number of e-folds. indeed, condition (7.2) signalling
the end of slow-roll k -ination can be rewritten (using eqs.
(4.6)-(4.9))
as [ k/(kh)]end  1, which means that k changes by 100% in a hubble
time, around the time of exit of k -ination. one therefore expects that one
can approximately match slow-roll k -ination with a post-inationary phase
where k() has become positive.

we think that, in most cases, this way of exiting k -ination provides a
naturally graceful exit. indeed, it is clear from fig. 2 that, after the tran-
sition to the k > 0 (weak-coupling) branch, the cosmological evolution
will quickly be attracted toward an approximate p   equation of state.
the corresponding expansion was discussed in eq. (3.2) and corresponds to
a very fast decrease of the energy density:   a6. as this decrease is
much faster than the decay of the energy density in radiation (rad  a4)
[and in non relativistic matter (matter  a3) if any is present], even small
traces of the latter forms of energy present at the end of k -ination will
ultimately dominate the expansion. the situation is very similar to what
has been recently discussed in ref.
[7]. as we have in mind that, in our
model, the scalar  could be the dilaton (or a moduli), i.e. a eld which
modies the coupling constants of all the other matter elds, we expect that
the nearly uniform time variation of  during k -ination will generate quan-
tum particles at a uniform spacetime rate. during k -ination the produced
particles are constantly diluted by the fast expansion and are not expected
to cause a strong back reaction, but the particles produced in the last e-fold
of k -ination should be suciently numerous to dominate soon the expan-
sion. even without this assumption (that the couplings of  are ecient in
producing particles), the mere eect of the variable gravitational coupling
(at the end of ination) is sucient to create any scalar particle with energy
density (at birth)  102h 4
to discuss more precisely the evolution of the inaton after it exits from
k -ination, i.e. when k() has become positive, and the higher-derivative
term l x 2 has become negligible, it is convenient to introduce the canonical

end [8] [4].

scalar eld  = r dpk(). in terms of  the equation of motion reads
 + 3h  = a3d(a3 )/dt  0, with h =  + rad. hence a3   c = const
and  evolves according to (t)  cr dt a3. in a rst phase after k -ination
 probably dominates over rad and the evolution follows the p =  attractor
solution eq. (3.2). during this initial phase a(t)  t1/3 so that (t) drifts
logarithmically: (t)  r t
dt/t = ln(t/tend). later, rad  a4 will take
over   a6 and the evolution will become radiation dominated. in this

tend

17

second phase, a(t)  t1/2 and (t)  cr t dta3  r t dt t3/2 stops drifting
logarithmically to converge toward some nal value f : (t)  f  ct1/2.
note that, in this generic exit mechanism, the nal value f of the original
eld (corresponding to the nal value f of the canonical eld) is arbitrary.
therefore, if  is the dilaton or a moduli our k -inationary mechanism does
not, by itself, provide a mechanism for xing  to a particular value. to
do that one must appeal either to the presence, at low-energies, of a -
dependent potential energy term v () (which may have been negligible at
high energies), or to a non-trivial structure of couplings to matter [3]. we
wish, however, to point out that some variants of our general model can
also provide another way of xing the end location of  very near a partic-
ular value. indeed, if the kinetic function k() (of the original  variable)
happens to have a pole singularity k()  (  p) with   2 in the
positive-k domain the corresponding canonical eld  = r dpk() di-
verges when   p. therefore, if this pole singularity is in the way of the
evolution of  after the exit from k -ination (e.g., if p < end < in in
the case where  < 0), the typically large logarithmic drift of the canonical
dt a3  ln(trad/tend)
(where trad denotes the beginning of radiation domination), will mean that
the original eld  will end up very near p.

evidently, this mechanism assumes that, except for k(), all the func-
tions describing the coupling of  to matter (like the one giving the -
dependence of the gauge couplings) are regular (or, at least, less singular) at
 = p. then, in the notation of ref. [3], the observable coupling strength
of  to matter a() = d ln ma()/d = (k())1/2d ln ma()/d is driven
near zero by our mechanism.

viii conclusions

2k()()2 + 1

we have pointed out that a general class of higher-order scalar kinetic terms
p(,) = 1
4l()()4 +   can drive an inationary evolu-
tion starting from rather arbitrary initial conditions. under not very restric-
tive conditions on the -dependence of the kinetic term p(,) the early
cosmological evolution will be attracted toward a slow-roll kinetically driven
inationary stage. in a large class of models this slow-roll behaviour has the
following attractive features: (i) it drives the evolution from an initial high-
curvature phase down to lower curvatures while dilating space in a quasi-
exponential or power law manner, (ii) it is stable under (high-frequency)
scalar perturbations, and (iii) it contains a natural exit mechanism because
of the -dependence of the kinetic terms.

18

we have briey discussed the exit of kinetically driven ination and found
that it seems to be naturally graceful in lending itself to a smooth transition
toward a stage dominated by the radiation produced (either through the -
dependence, or through purely gravitational eects) at the end of slow-roll.
we have also pointed out that the presence of pole-like singularities in the
-dependence of the kinetic terms can have some useful consequences: (i) a
-dependence of the form  (  )2 p() in the initial eld domain can
ensure a nearly constant speed of sound of order unity, while (ii) a pole-like
singularity in the coecient ()2 in the nal eld domain can help to x
the value of  to a specic value.
we leave to future work the investigation of general important issues: the
choice of (a measure on the) initial conditions, and the computation of the
perturbation spectra generated by this new type of ination. we are aware
that the compatibility of the latter issues with observations will probably
necessitate the presence of some small (or large) dimensionless parameters in
p(,).
in this work, we have used the structure of the eective action in string
theory as a partial motivation for considering higher-order kinetic terms
p(,). having found that such terms can generically drive an ination-
ary behaviour, we hope that our mechanism might be useful in suggesting
new ways in which the dilaton and moduli elds of string theory might be
compatible with ination.
