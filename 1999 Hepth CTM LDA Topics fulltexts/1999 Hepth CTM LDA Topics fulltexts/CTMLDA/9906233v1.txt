abstract

we give the lax representations for for the elliptic, hyperbolic and homogeneous sec-

ond order monge-amp`ere equations. the connection between these equations and the

equations of hydrodynamical type give us a scalar dispersionless lax representation. a

matrix dispersive lax representation follows from the correspondence between sigma mod-

els, a two parameter equation for minimal surfaces and monge-amp`ere equations. local

as well nonlocal conserved densities are obtained.

1. introduction

the nonlinear partial dierential equation in 1 + 1 dimensions

uttuxx  u 2

tx = k

1

(1)

is the second order monge-amp`ere equation. here we will be interested in the case where

k is a constant. for k = 1 we have the hyperbolic monge-amp`ere equation which is
equivalent [1] to the born-infeld equation [2]. the choice k = 1 yields the elliptic monge-
amp`ere equation that is related [3,4] to the equation for minimal surfaces [5]. finally, k = 0

corresponds to the homogeneous monge-amp`ere equation that can be shown to be related

to the bateman equation [6]. the born-infeld, minimal surfaces and bateman equations

can be treated simultaneously as

(k2 + 2

x)tt  2xtxt + (k2 + 2

t )xx = 0

where

  k2  k  1

(2)

(3)

and we should keep in mind the trivial identities k2 = k and k = k2.

the born-infeld equation was introduced in 1934 as a nonlinear generalization of

maxwells electrodynamics.

it is the simplest wave equation in 1+1 dimensions, that

preserves lorentz invariance and is nonlinear. this equation is integrable [7,8] and has

a multi-hamiltonian structure [9]. the bateman equation was introduced in 1929 and is

related with hydrodynamics. this equation has a very interesting behavior [10]. if (x, t)

is a solution of (2), for k = 0, so is any function of it (covariance of (2)). also, (2) can

be derived from an innite class of inequivalent lagrangian densities and is form invariant

under arbitrary linear transformations of the (x, t) coordinates. the equation for minimal

surfaces gives the surface z = (x, t) in the three-dimensional space that spans a given

contour and has the minimum area. this is the plateaus problem and has interest both

in physics and mathematics.

in this paper we will obtain lax representations for (1) and (2) since both systems

are related. a scalar dispersionless lax representation as well a matrix dispersive lax

2

representation will be given. as far as the authors can say this is the rst example of

a system where both lax pairs are present. in fact our results suggest that many other

systems, which have both an innite number of local and nonlocal charges, are likely to

have such characteristic.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review the bianchi transformation

which relates (1) and (2). this is the proposition 2.1 that unies the results obtained in

[1,3,4]. with this transformation we can easily translate results from the system (1) to

system (2) and vice-versa. the existence of this bianchi transformation is due to the fact

that both (1) and (2) can be rewritten in a hydrodynamic type equation (polytropic gas).

in section 3, using results from [8,11,12], we obtain the dispersionless lax representation

of (1) (proposition 3.1) and write the two sets of local conserved charges densities for the

monge-amp`ere equation. in section 4 we generalize the results of [5,13,14] concerning the

matrix lax representation for minimal surfaces through its correspondence with the sigma

model. we obtain a matrix lax representation for a two parameter equation for minimal

surfaces which includes (2) for particular choices of the parameter (proposition 4.4). from

this lax representation we give the nonlocal conserved charges densities of the system. in

section 5 we write explicitly the lax representations, obtained in the previous sections, for

the monge-amp`ere system (1) using the bianchi transformation (proposition 5.1). finally

we present our conclusions in section 6.

2. bianchi transformation

in order to see the connection between (1) and (2) (see equation (16))we have to

express these equations in the form of equations of hydrodynamic type [15]. following

[9,16] we rst introduce the potentials a and b, dened as

a =ux

b =ut

then, equation (1) can be expressed as a rst order system

k(at  bx) = 0
(b2
x  k)
bt =

1
ax

(4)

(5)

3

which is the natural starting point for a hamiltonian treatment of monge-amp`ere equations

(1).

now, introducing

bx
ax

u = 
v =ax

(6)

the monge-amp`ere equation can be written in the following hydrodynamic type equation

form

ut + uux + kv3vx =0

k(vt + (uv)x) =0

equation (2) follows from the lagrangian

l =qk2 + 2

x + 2
t

(7)

(8)

we stress that the bateman equation can be obtained from a large class of inequivalent
lagrangian. however, we will use this one and the limit k  0 will give us results for the
bateman equation.

since (8) has no  dependence (2) can be written as a conservation law given by

x(cid:18) l

x(cid:19) + t(cid:18) l

t(cid:19) = 0

(9)

this result allows us to rewrite (2) as a set of coupled rst order nonlinear equations.

following [9,16] let us express (2) as the integrability condition of a rst-order system

given by

introducing the variables

we get from (10)

(10)

(11)

(12)

so, the one-forms

d =r dx  sr k2 + r2
d =s dx + rr 1  s2

are exact and its closure give us the equations

rx 

(1  s2)3

rx  s k2 + r2
p(k2 + r2)(1  s2)

(13)

(14)

now the amazing fact is that equation (14) is also related with equation (7) by a special

transformation. for the case k = 1 this transformation is known as the verosky transfor-

mation [9]. we can easily check that the following k generalized verosky transformation

rs

u =

p(k2 + r2)(1  s2)
kv = kp(k2 + r2)(1  s2)

links (14) with (7). from the diagram

equation (7) for k = 1 corresponds to the equations of isentropic, polytropic gas
dynamics with the adiabatic index  = 1 [9]. this system is known as a chaplygin gas
[17]. for k = 0 (7) is the riemann equation [11] and in this case the transformation (15)
give us u =  t

x

.

in [12] the polytropic gas dynamics [18] equations

ut + uux + v2vx =0 ,

were derived from the following dispersionless nonstandard lax representation

and yields the monge-amp`ere equation as expressed in (5).

this proposition is the rst main result of our paper. this is a dispersionless lax

representation, a dispersive one will be obtained in section 5 (see proposition 5.1).

conserved charges for the chaplygin gas like equations (19) can be easily obtained

from (20) through [8,12]

hn = tr ln+ +2

4. minimal surfaces and sigma models

in this section we will generalize some results of [5,13,14] where a matrix lax repre-

sentation for the minimal surface equation (eq. (2) with k = 1) was obtained.

let g be a 2  2 matrix function with components

g11 =

k1 + a2



,

g12 = g21 =

ab


and g22 =

k2 + b2



,

where k1 and k2 are arbitrary constants, not vanishing simultaneously and

2 = k1k2 + k1b2 + k2a2 , where

 = 1.

thus, det g = . note that  is not fully independent of k1 and k2. 2 > 0 when we are

dealing with real elds. in the case of complex elds  is independent of k1 and k2 .

the sigma model equation can be written as

(gg1g) = 0 ,

8

(29)

where g are the components of g1. as shown in [5] and [13] the lax representation of

(29) is

 =

1

2 + (cid:2)g  (cid:3) (g1g),

(30)

where  is levi-civita tensor with 12 = 1,  is the spectral parameter, det g =  and
 = 1.

now, let us see how a lax representation for (2) can be obtained from (30). first, let

m3 be a 3-dimensional manifold with metric

ds2|m3 = k1dt2 + k2dx2 + dz2

(k1 6= 0, k2 6= 0)

and z = (t, x) dene a graph of a regular surface s in m3. the induced metric on s is

given by

ds2|s = (k1 + 2

t )dt2 + (k2 + 2

x)dx2 + 2xtdxdt.

if a = t and b = x, then g is a metric tensor on s. surface s is called minimal if its

mean curvature h vanishes. minimality condition leads to the equation

g = 0,

or

(k1 + 2

t )xx  2xtxt + (k2 + 2

x)tt = 0 .

(31)

there is a parametrization of the minimal surfaces where the minimality condition reduces
to the laplace equation in 2-dimensions. let x : s  m3 dene a parametrization of s
in m3. this parametrization is called isothermal [19,20], if

hxu xui = hxv xvi

hxu xvi = 0

( = 1)

(32)

(33)

9

proposition 4.1. s is a minimal surface if and only if xuu + xvv = 0, where x is an

isothermal parametrization.

a connection between the above two dierent parametrizations may be obtained from

the following two propositions:
proposition 4.2. let z = (t, x) dene a regular surface s. parametrization x : s  m3
is isothermal if and only if the following equations are satised

(k1 + 2

(k2 + 2

t )tu = xv  txxu ,
t )tv = xu  txxv .

(34)

the proof of the proposition 4.2 can be done in the following way. the equation (33)

can be written as

xu(k2xv + 2

xxv + txtv) + tu(k1tv + txxv + 2

t tv) = 0

and it is equivalent to the system

( tu = 1[(k2 + 2

xu = 1[(k1 + 2

x)xv + txtv]

t )tv + txxv] .

inserting expressions for tu and xu into (32), it can be found that

2 = (k1k2 + k12

x + k22

t ).

hence,  =  and

( tu = 1[(k2 + 2

xu = 1[(k1 + 2

x)xv + txtv]

t )tv + txxv].

that is equivalent to (34).

proposition 4.1 and 4.2 imply next proposition:

proposition 4.3. let x and t be harmonic functions of u and v. let a dierentiable

function (t, x) be dened by (34). then the function (t, x) is a harmonic function of u

and v if and only if it satises the minimality condition (31).

let us consider equation (31), where k1 and k2 are arbitrary constants. we have four

distinct cases:

10

(i) k1k2 > 0.

(1) k1 > 0, k2 > 0. this is equivalent to the equation of minimal surface in r3 or

(2)

elliptic monge-amp`ere equation (k1 = k2 = k = 1).
k1 > 0, k2 < 0. this is equivalent to the equation of minimal surface in m3
(3-dimensional minkowski space with metric (1, 1, 1)).

(ii) k1k2 < 0. this is equivalent to the born-infeld equation (which is the equation
of a minimal surface in a 3-dimensional minkowski space with metric (1, 1, 1)) or
hyperbolic monge-amp`ere equation (k1 = k2 = k = 1).

we have the following cases which do not arise from the embedding problem in m3:

(iii) k1k2 = 0, but not simultaneously vanishing. this is a new type of equation.

(iv) k1 = k2 = 0. this is bateman equation or homogeneous monge-amp`ere equation

(k1 = k2 = k = 0).

the next proposition is very important since it provides the lax pair for systems that

include equation (2):

proposition 4.4 let  be a dierential function of t, x and let a = t, b = x. then

equation (31) solves the sigma model equation (29), if k1, k2 not vanish simultaneously.

if k1 = k2 = 0 equation (31) solves the sigma model equation (29) for another matrix g,

namely,

g11 = a1

t
x

,

g12 = g21 = b1

and g22 = a2

x
t

,

where a1, a2, b1 are constants. the lax pair of (31) is then given by (30).

in the next section we will use the last proposition to obtain the lax representations

for the monge-amp`ere equations (1). in doing so we will return to our original parameter k

instead of working with the parameters k1 and k2. it is just a matter of scale transformation
either in formula for ds2|m3 or in equation (31) (redening x and t) to give k1 = 1 and
k2 = 1. also, we will set  = 1 in the next section.

5. matrix lax representation: nonlocal conserved charges

now we can write the lax pairs for (1). first, let us give the lax pairs for (2) more

explicitly. equation (30) can be rewritten in the form


x

=


t

= 

where

1

2 + 1(cid:2)(cid:0)g11a + g12b(cid:1)  b(cid:3) 
2 + 1(cid:2)(cid:0)g21a + g22b(cid:1) + a(cid:3) 

1

a = g1tg , b = g1xg

from (36) it follows the identity

a
x 

b
t  [a, b] = 0

the integrability of (35) yields the equations

det g = 1

(g11a  g12b)t + (g21a + g22b)x = 0

from the proposition 4.4 we have for k 6= 0

and for k = 0 (setting a1 = a2 = 2 and b1 = 1)

with this choice (37) and (38) are trivial identities and (39) is identical to equation (2),
i.e., to the minimal surface equation for k = 1, born-infeld equation for k = 1 and
bateman equation for k = 0.

the bianchi transformation (16) for k 6= 0 assumes the form

k utt =
k utx =

and (40) in terms of u can be written as

g = 

k  utt utx
utx uxx!

12

(43)

in this way (35) with (43) give us the matrix lax representation for the hyperbolic monge-
amp`ere equation (k = 1) and elliptic monge-amp`ere equation (k = 1). let us observe
that (1) for k 6= 0 follows from (38) while equations (37) and (39) are trivial identities.
we can also express (43) in terms of variables a and b dened in (4) by

g = 

k  bt

bx ax!

bx

(44)

and (5) follows easily since at = bx is a trivial identity and det g = k(btax  b2
bianchi transformation (16) for k = 0 yields

x) = 1. the

and (41) in terms of u can be written as

(45)

(46)

(47)

and det g = 1 reproduces (1) for k = 0. in terms of the variables a and b we have

g =
g =

which give us (5) for k = 0.

so, we have the following proposition:

proposition 5.1 the lax pair (35) with (44) or (47) yields the monge-amp`ere equations
as expressed in (5) for k 6= 0 and k = 0, respectively.

this proposition is the second main result of our paper. this is a matrix dispersive

lax representation.

in section 3, using the dispersionless lax representation for the monge-amp`ere equa-

tions (1), we were able to derive two sets of innite number of local conserved charges.

now, using (35) it will possible to nd innitely non local conserved ones. let us denote
m = (g11a + g12b) and n = g21a + g22b, then the lax pair (35) can be written as

13

or

(2 + 1)x =  m   g1gx
(2 + 1)t =  n   g1gt

(g)x =  gm   2g x
(g)t =  gn   2g t

(48)

let us assume that function  is analytical in the parameter  and can be expanded as

 = 0 + 1 + 22 +   

then, equations (48) imply

0 =g1

(g1)x =  gm g1
(g1)t =  gn g1
(g2)x =gxg1 + gm g11

x (gm g1)

(g2)t =gtg1 + gn g11

t

(gn g1)

...

(49)

(50)

and we have now innitely many conserved laws in the form (xn)x = (tn)t where the

densities are

x1 =n

t1 =m

x2 =g1gt + (1

t n )n

t2 =g1gx + (1

x m )m

...

(51)

now we can use (44) and (47) to express the densities tn in terms of variables a and b.

6. conclusion

in this paper we have obtained the lax representation of the monge-amp`ere equations

(1).

in section 2 the bianchi transformation relating equations (1) and (2) was given

(proposition 2.1). this transformation allowed us to translate results obtained for one

equation to the other. in section 3 the dispersionless lax pair for (1) as well the local

conserved densities were given (proposition 3.1). in section 4 the correspondence between

sigma models and a two parameter equation for minimal surfaces was given and the matrix

lax pair for equation (2) was obtained (proposition 4.4). a lax representation for the

system (1) as well the nonlocal conserved densities were given in section 5 (proposition

5.1).

the algebra of the local and nonlocal charges that follows from (27), (28) and (51)

as well the multihamiltonian formulation of the monge-amp`ere equations (1) will be the

subject of a future publication. some results on this line for the second order homoge-

neous monge-amp`ere equation were already obtained in [21,22]. as we have pointed, the

homogeneous monge-amp`ere equation has an innite number of inequivalent lagrangians

and somehow this should be reected in its lax representation. this also deserves further

clarications.
