abstract

we obtain rst order equations that determine a supersymmetric kink solution in ve-
dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity. the kink interpolates between an exterior anti-de
sitter region with maximal supersymmetry and an interior anti-de sitter region with one
quarter of the maximal supersymmetry. one eighth of supersymmetry is preserved by the
kink as a whole. we interpret it as describing the renormalization group ow in n = 4
super-yang-mills theory broken to an n = 1 theory by the addition of a mass term for
one of the three adjoint chiral superelds. a detailed correspondence is obtained between
elds of bulk supergravity in the interior anti-de sitter region and composite operators of
the infrared eld theory. we also point out that the truncation used to nd the reduced
symmetry critical point can be extended to obtain a new n = 4 gauged supergravity
theory holographically dual to a sector of n = 2 gauge theories based on quiver diagrams.
we consider more general kink geometries and construct a c-function that is positive
and monotonic if the dominant energy condition holds in the bulk gravity theory. for
even-dimensional boundaries, the c-function coincides with the trace anomaly coecients
of the holographically related eld theory in limits where conformal invariance is recovered.

1. introduction

the conjecture [1] of the equivalence of string theory on ads5  s5 to n = 4 super-
symmetric yang-mills theory in (3 + 1)-dimensions derived some of its initial motivation
and plausibility from the su (2, 2|4) superconformal invariance of both sides of the equiva-
lence. optimistically, one might expect that the strategy for computing greens functions
[2,3] is more general, and applies to any situation where a quantum eld theory (qft) on
the boundary of a spacetime can be related to properties of a quantum gravity theory in
the bulk. to test this expectation it would be good to have an example of a qftgravity
pair where the qft is non-conformal but nevertheless well-understood at least in some
aspects which can be probed from the gravity side.

the main purpose of this paper is to provide such an example. the qft will be the
n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory obtained from n = 4 super-yang-mills by adding a
mass to one of the three chiral adjoint superelds. the mass breaks conformal invariance.
however, it follows from the work of leigh and strassler [4] that the theory has xed lines
and thus superconformal behavior in both the ultraviolet and the infrared. the theory
can be made strongly coupled in both limits by making the ultraviolet t hooft coupling
large, and so a supergravity description at large n should be possible.

we believe that the supergravity dual of this eld theory ow is the kink solution that
is discussed in section 5, and which interpolates between the ads geometries at two critical
points of ve-dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity [5,6,7]. the critical point describing
the uv end of the ow is the expected maximally supersymmetric vacuum of the bulk
theory, which is dual to n = 4 sym. the kink itself preserves four real supercharges,
as does the eld theory described in the previous paragraph.
in the ir limit the kink
approaches the critical point with n = 2 bulk supersymmetry that was discovered in [8].
the most direct evidence for the correspondence between the eld theory ow and
the supergravity kink is that the symmetries match. along the whole rg ow there is
su (2)  u (1) global symmetry, and this symmetry is also present in the kink. the ads
geometries at the endpoints imply conformal symmetry in the uv and ir limits of the
eld theory, and there is su (2, 2|4) symmetry at the uv end and su (2, 2|1) symmetry
at the ir end. furthermore, the limiting behavior of the kink near its uv endpoint
involves scalars with the right quantum numbers and dimensions to be dual to the mass
term for one adjoint chiral supereld. there is additional evidence from the match of
trace anomaly coecients computed at both endpoints in eld theory and through the
ads/cft correspondence. the authors of [9] independently considered the eld theory
rg ow and the matching of trace anomaly coecients.

1

to probe this correspondence more deeply, we compute mass eigenvalues of all elds of

gauged supergravity at the non-trivial supersymmetric critical point. we use this and the

results of [2,3] to obtain the scaling dimensions of the corresponding gauge theory operators.

the details are presented in section 6 and in an appendix. boson and fermion operators
neatly combine into multiplets that are representations of the superalgebra su (2, 2|1) of
n = 1 superconformal symmetry in four dimensions. we exhibit gauge invariant com-
binations of the massless superelds of the gauge theory whose scaling dimensions and
su (2)  u (1) quantum numbers precisely match the ve short multiplets observed in su-
pergravity. there are three additional long multiplets which complete the picture. this

detailed eld-operator map constitutes perhaps the strong evidence that the supergravity
critical point is indeed the holographic dual of the mass-deformed n = 4 theory.

having established the holographic duals of both supergravity critical points, and

examined small perturbations around the corresponding xed point eld theories, we make

the next obvious leap, which is to nd the supergravity description of the (non-conformal)

renormalization group ow between the two xed points. this is presented in sections 4

and 5.

non-conformal examples of the bulk-boundary holographic relation (which we will

refer to as the strong holographic principle) already exist in the literature (see for instance

[10,11,12,13,14,15,16]), but from the point of view of testing the duality most of these are

vexed either by an incomplete understanding of the boundary theory, or by a bulk geometry

where supergravity is unreliable due to tachyons, or large curvatures, or a strong dilaton

or some combination of these. another general problem of studying rg ows through

the bulk-boundary correspondence is that the validity of supergravity depends on having

strong coupling in the gauge theory, so that results cannot be compared with perturbative

treatments of the renormalization group ow. for instance, it is dicult to verify from

a eld theory point of view any of the properties of the su (3)-symmetric critical point

found in [6] and further studied in [17,18]. what allows us to make non-trivial eld theory

predictions about the infrared xed point is the supersymmetry of the xed point and the
n = 1 supersymmetry that must be preserved throughout the ow.

before actually specializing to the supersymmetric ow we rst, in section 4, consider

supergravity kinks that could be used to describe renormalization group ows in general.

we are able to identify a monotonic function along the kink which interpolates between

the anomaly coecients at one end and at the other. using nothing more than einsteins

equations and the dominant energy condition it is possible to show that such a function

can always be found in any kink geometry with the poincare symmetries of the boundary

2

theory in at space. the argument is dimension-independent. thus, on rather general
grounds, the strong holographic principle implies a c-theorem, at least in the regime where

classical gravity is a reliable guide to the bulk physics.

in section 5 we nd the supergravity kink corresponding to the supersymmetric renor-
malization group ow described above. we do this by demanding that one eighth of su-

persymmetry is unbroken throughout the bulk, and we thus obtain rst order equations
for a kink solution that interpolates between the maximally supersymmetric critical point

and the one-quarter supersymmetric point of [8]. the rst order equations for the scalar
elds are the gradient ow equations of a superpotential dened on a restricted four-
dimensional slice of the scalar manifold, and simply related to the potential of gauged

supergavity on this slice.

we work within the framework of gauged n = 8 supergravity in ve dimensions
because its full non-linear structure is known. this is not the case for the complete
kaluza-klein reduction of ten-dimensional type iib supergravity on s5. the spectrum
of ve-dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity includes only the rst few kaluza-klein
modes of the ten-dimensional theory, but it is a complete theory at the classical level and
was argued in [8] to be a consistent truncation of the parent theory. this has not been

proven explicitly but is expected after suitable eld redenitions of the heavy kk modes.
consistent truncation means that any solution of the truncated theory can be lifted to a

solution of the untruncated theory.

m n

another reason for working with ve-dimensional gauged supergravity is that it ef-
ciently encodes a class of metric deformations of the s5, and a family of backgrounds
for bns,rr
elds where the indices lie in the s5 directions. to be more specic, the
ve-dimensional gauged supergravity has 42 scalar elds that parameterize the coset
e6(6)/u sp(8). from the holographic perspective two of these scalars correspond to the
yang-mills gauge coupling and -angle, 20 of them parametrize yang-mills scalar masses
(deformations of the metric on s5), and the other 20 parametrize the possible yang-mills
fermion masses (special backgrounds for bns,rr
). indeed gauged n = 8 supergravity in
ve dimensions is holographically dual to the yang-mills energy-momentum tensor super-
multiplet, and the supergravity scalars are the moduli of this supermultiplet: the couplings
and the masses.

m n

the lagrangian of gauged n = 8 supergravity has a scalar potential v which is
invariant under the gauged subalgebra, so(6) = su (4), of e6(6). critical points of the
potential v give rise to ads5 solutions of gauged supergravity. the list of known critical
points can be found in [8]. for some of them the corresponding ten-dimensional geometry

3

can be found in the literature:

for the su (3) symmetric points see [19]; for the so(5)

symmetric points see [20]. the critical point which we will claim describes the infrared
endpoint of our ow is the recently discovered su (2)  u (1)-symmetric point with one-
quarter supersymmetry [8]. the corresponding ten-dimensional geometry is, as yet, not

known, but its metric can be computed using the results of [8].

the known critical points of [8] were found by specializing to an eleven-dimensional,
truncated submanifold, s, of e6(6)/u sp(8). this is the invariant subspace under a partic-
ular su (2) subgroup of so(6) = su (4). since this scalar submanifold will play a major

role in our work we will review its structure in detail in section 3 and in two appendices.

on a more physical note, in section 7 we point out that the truncation of the scalar
manifold can be extended to the full theory and leads to a complete ve-dimensional n = 4
gauged supergravity theory coupled to two tensor multiplets. we suggest that this theory
captures a sector common to all n = 2 superconformal gauge theories based on quiver
diagrams [21,22], and that the kink we have found may reect certain renormalization

group ows in these theories as well.

a comment on the counting of supersymmetries may prevent future confusion. a
ve-dimensional supergravity theory is referred to as having n -extended supersymmetry
if the invariance of the lagrangian is characterized by 4n real supercharges, and similarly
with a background of supergravity. the minimally supersymmetric ve-dimensional su-
pergravity has n = 2 in the lagrangian. as always, maximal supersymmetry is 32 real
supercharges. a four-dimension eld theory with n -extended supersymmetry also has
4n real supercharges, unless it also has conformal symmetry, which doubles the number
of supercharges to 8n .
in an eort to speak french to the french and english to the
americans, we will refer to a supergravity background dual to an n = 1 superconformal
eld theory as n = 2.

2. field theory motivation

asymptotic freedom and connement are dicult to capture reliably in a supergrav-

ity geometry. for asymptotic freedom this is because the t hooft coupling eventually
gets weak in the ultraviolet, and  corrections become important to any supergravity
description. all geometric attempts to describe connement include singularities (some

more malignant than others), and there is a variety of problems regarding the discrepancy

between the conning string tension and the mass gap, nearly at regge trajectories, and

4

unwanted global symmetries. the study of renormalization group ows in supersymmet-
ric gauge theories provides us with some examples where both the ultraviolet and the
infrared xed points are conformal, and neither asymptotic freedom nor connement is
encountered.

the example upon which we want to focus is a relevant deformation of n = 4 super-
yang-mills theory by a mass term for one of the three n = 1 adjoint chiral superelds
which, together with the n = 1 adjoint vector supereld, ll out the full n = 4 gauge
multiplet. in n = 1 language, the superpotential is
w = tr 3[1, 2] + 1

(2.1)
the rst term is the superpotential required by n = 4 supersymmetry. the second term
breaks n = 4 down to n = 1, and also destroys conformal invariance, so the total number
of real supercharges is reduced from thirty-two to four. the theory does have a non-trivial
infrared xed point. indeed, it was shown in [4] that by choosing the anomalous dimensions
1 = 2 = 1/4 and 3 = 1/2 for 1, 2, and 3, one could simultaneously make the
nsvz exact beta function [23],

vanish, and make the superpotential in (2.1) dimension three, which is marginal. note
that it is immaterial in this analysis whether one integrates out 3 or not. the theory we
have described has some features in common with n = 1 sqcd with nf = 2nc, and it is
its own seiberg dual.

that the infrared xed point of this ow is the holographic dual theory to the one-
quarter supersymmetric vacuum found in [8] seems to have been observed independently
by several groups, including the present authors, the authors of [9], and m. strassler [24].
for us the crucial observation was that the coecients in the trace anomaly predicted by
eld theory match those observed in supergravity. the coecients we aim to calculate are
a and c in the one anomalous point functions which in the notation of [25] read

in the presence of a metric g and a source v for the r-current r. the normalization of
a and c is such that c = 1/120 for a single free, real scalar, and c = (n 2
c  1)/4 for su (nc)
super-yang-mills. the combinations a c and 5a 3c in the second line are consequences
of n = 1 supersymmetry [25]. in the ultraviolet, where we can eectively set m3 = 0,
we arrive at a  c = 0 and 5a  3c  8
c  1) by inspection of the triangle diagrams
in figure 1. the current r assigns r() = 1 to the gauginos and r() = 1/3 to the

the non-anomalous s current generates an exact symmetry of the mass-deformed theory,

this symmetry is called u (1)r in subsequent sections.

from the gravity side it is more straightforward to compute ht 

 i, since we can rely
on the analysis of [27]. we remain in mostly minus conventions. suppose we are given

the agreement betwen (2.5) and (2.8) is a sign that we have found the correct eld theory
interpretation of the infrared ads region. it is straightforward to check the overall normal-
ization of a and c: (2.7) leads to auv = cuv = n 2/4, which diers from the su (n ) gauge
theory result only by a 1/n 2 correction. this agreement can be traced back to absorption
calculations [gkschwing].

the essentials of the anomaly-matching analysis were worked out in [28] for the coni-
fold theory introduced in [29]. aspects of it were also employed in [18] and in particular in
[9] in a eld theory analysis independent of our own for the one-quarter supersymmetric
xed point of [8].

the elds involved in the interpolating solution between the maximally supersym-
metric anti-de sitter vacuum of gauged supergravity and the one-quarter supersymmetric
vacuum have masses near the maximally supersymmetric end which correspond to opera-
tors of dimensions 2 and 3. these are, respectively, the boson and fermion mass involved in
the second term of (2.1). appropriately, turning on the scalar dual to the boson mass term
preserves so(4)  so(2)  so(6), while turning on the scalar dual to the fermion mass
term preserves su (3). together they break the symmetry down to su (2)  u (1). if one

7

regards the presence of these scalars in the interpolating solution, plus the supersymmetry,

plus the existence of the interior ads region, as sucient evidence that the infrared xed
point in eld theory is described by the deformation of n = 4 super-yang-mills which we
have discussed above, then the agreement between (2.5) and (2.8) can be regarded as a

successful eld theory prediction of the value of the scalar potential v at the saddle point

that denes this solution. from this point of view, testing dimensions of scalar operators in

eld theory against masses of gauged supergravity elds amounts to checking eld theory

predictions of the second derivatives of v at the saddle point.

3. n = 8 supergravity and conformal phases of yang-mills theory

all the 42 scalars in ve-dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity participate in the
scalar potential except for the dilaton and the axion. in view of the correspondence to

operators in the yang-mills theory explained in the introduction, critical points of this
potential correspond to conformal xed points of n = 4 yang-mills theory obtained by
turning (yang-mills) fermion and scalar masses and running to the infrared.

in an eort to classify some of the new phases of the yang-mills theory the authors
of [8] classied all critical points of the n = 8 gauged supergravity potential preserving at
least a particular su (2) symmetry. the initial motivation for this was largely pragmatic:

reducing the problem of forty two scalars to a solvable one involving only eleven. as we

will explain in more detail in section 7, the truncation to su (2) singlets can be extended
to the whole n = 8 theory, and the result is a gauged n = 4 supergravity theory coupled
to two tensor multiplets. we believe that this truncated theory is holographically dual to
a subsector of operators which is common to all n = 2 super-yang-mills theories based
upon quiver diagrams.

the purpose of this section is to review the analysis in [8] of critical points in super-

gravity with particular attention to the one that preserves one quarter of supersymmetry.

this critical point is a reasonable candidate for the description of the ir xed point of the

eld theory ow described in section 2. we begin in section 3.1 by summarizing the su (2)

singlet sector of the supergravity scalars. we also dene a sort of superpotential which is

helpful for the analysis of supersymmetry. we summarize this analysis at the critical point

in section 3.2, and we extend it to non-anti-de sitter geometries in section 5.

8

3.1. the scalar structure of the su (2) singlet sector

the n = 8 supergravity theory has a gauge symmetry of su (4) or so(6). we consider
the su (2)i su (2)gu (1)g subgroup of su (4), and look at the singlets of su (2)i. (the
subscripts i and g on the groups are intended to distinguish the invariance group from

the residual gauge group.) as was discussed in [8], these scalar singlets may be thought

of as parametrizing the coset:

s =

so(5, 2)

so(5)  so(2)  o(1, 1) .

(3.1)

the group so(5, 2) contains an obvious so(3)  so(2, 2) subgroup, and so(2, 2) =
sl(2, ir) sl(2, ir). the so(3) is su (2)g, one sl(2, ir) describes the dilaton and axion
of the theory, and u (1)g is the compact subgroup of the other sl(2, ir).

the scalar potential, v , on the eleven-dimenensional scalar manifold, s, has a residual
su (2)  u (1)  sl(2, ir) invariance and can therefore be parametrized in terms of four
real variables [kpw]:

v = 

g2

4 h4 (cid:0)1  cos2(2) (sinh2(1)  sinh2(2))2(cid:1)

+ 2(cosh(21) + cosh(22)) +

 2 sin2(2) cosh(2(1  2))  cosh(41)  cosh(42)(cid:1)i .

1
16

8 (cid:0)2 + 2 sin2(2)

(3.2)

our variables are related to those of [8] by rx = (1  2)/2, ry = (1 + 2)/2, and
 = 2. as in [8],  = e, parametrizes one sheet of the o(1, 1) factor of (3.1).

the n = 8 supergravity has a u sp(8) invariance, and in particular the scalar structure
is encoded in two u sp(8) tensors, wab and aabcd. the truncation of the u sp(8) indices

to the singlets of su (2)i can be eected by projecting the 8 of u sp(8) onto the space

spanned by the four vectors

v1 = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0) ,

v2 = (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0) ,

v1 = (0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0) ,
v2 = (0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0,1) .

(3.3)

these vectors also turn out to be global eigenvectors of the tensor wab, with eigenvalues,
1, 1 and 2, 2 respectively, where

1 =

of the partial derivatives of w with respect to i, and as we will see, this is the proper

3.2. supersymmetric backgrounds

to nd supersymmetric bosonic backgrounds one sets the variations of the spin-1/2
and spin-3/2 elds to zero. from [6], the gravitational and scalar parts of these variations
are:

6 gwabb ,

a = da  1
abc = 2 hp abcdd  1

2 gadabcdi .

(3.10)

we remind the reader that we use mostly minus metric conventions, and {, } = 2 .
for a background with constant scalars, one nds that the vanishing of  relates the ads
radius to the eigenvalues of wab. the vanishing of abc is equivalent, via a tensor identity,
to the vanishing of a. however, vanishing of abc directly leads to the condition
that one has a supersymmetric background with constant scalars if and only if  = 0
and w/j = 0 in (3.5). this statement was proved with the help of mathematica
calculations, and is the rst of several important places in this work where mathematica
was essential. note that the conditions  = 0 and w/j = 0 are sucient but not
necessary condition for v to have a critical point.

one can easily verify that supersymmetry preserving ground states are obtained by

taking:

all other su (2)i-invariant supersymmetric ground states (besides the trivial n = 4 point)
are zz2 images of the ones specied in (3.11), and can be obtained from these either via the
interchange 1  2 or by going to the other component of o(1, 1). these supersymmetric
ground states were found in [8]. they all have v0 =  24/3
3 g2 and n = 2 supersymmetry (in
the supergravity sense described at the end of section 1). the supersymmetry generators
for (3.11) are given by using the projectors v1 and v1 of (3.3). if one considers the ground
states with 1  2, then the unbroken supersymmetries are given by v2 and v2.

in section 6 we will investigate the supergravity spectrum at the critical point specied
by (3.11). our results, and their interpretation within the holographic map between bulk
eld and boundary operators, will provide detailed evidence that this critical point is
the supergravity description of the infrared xed point of the supersymmetric rg ow
described in section 2. the prima facie evidence for this, as commented in section 2, is
that the value of v0 translates into the correct trace anomaly for the supersymmetric gauge
theory. before entering into the detailed investigation of the xed point, we will show how
supergravity can provide a description of the entire rg ow from the n = 4 uv theory
to the n = 1 infrared xed point.

4. generalities on holographic rg ows: a c-theorem

an important aspect of the ads/cft correspondence is the notion that the radial

coordinate u of ads can be regarded as a measure of energy. thus a geometrical cuto

of ads serves as an ultraviolet regulator. these ideas were implicit in [1,2,3] and have

subsequently been developed more fully in [30,31]. phenomena that probe smaller values

of u are to be thought of as probing the infrared structure of the theory. for instance,

if one computes greens functions by setting the values of supergravity elds at nite u ,

then making u smaller is believed to provide a natural coarse-graining of the uv details,

thereby implementing a version of the wilsonian renormalization group.

in this context a supergravity kink in the u -direction interpolating between u = 
and u = 0 can be thought of as an explicit construction of a renormalization group ow

between a uv xed point and an ir xed point of the boundary eld theory [17,18]. our

purpose in this section is to exhibit the general ansatz for a kink and to demonstrate one

simple property of kinks that translates via holography into a c-theorem for the boundary

theory.

4.1. the kink ansatz

we start by considering arbitrary bulk dimension d. we are interested in boundary
theories that are poincare invariant in (d  1) dimensions. the most general possible
d-dimensional bulk metric consistent with this symmetry can be written as

ds2 = e2a(r) dxdx  dr2 .

(4.1)

we will always use the mostly minus metric convention, which has the consequence that

anti-de sitter space has a positive cosmological constant. we could generalize (4.1) by

if a(r) = r

replacing  by an arbitrary ricci-at metric , and none of the analysis in this section
or the next would change.
 , then (4.1) becomes anti-de sitter space with
r = d1
2 g. other standard radial variables for anti-de sitter space are u = er//
[1] and z = x0 = er/ [2,3]. the kink that we shall exhibit in section 5 interpolates
between an r   ultraviolet ads5 region, where a(r) is linear, and an r  
infrared region, where a(r) is again linear, but with a larger positive slope. a sketch of

the spacetime with the spatial boundary dimensions suppressed is shown in figure 2.

fig. 2: the supergravity kink interpolates between an asymptotically ads space in

the uv (r  ) and another in the ir (r  ). the value of c(r) decreases

monotonically as one moves toward the infrared, and in the asymptotic regions the

value of c(r) approaches the central charge.

the geometry depicted in figure 2 is not the only possibility allowed by the ansatz
(4.1). for the purpose of studying the ads/cft correspondence we are interested in
geometries which are asymptotic to anti-de sitter space on one end: that is, a(r)  r
as r  . other geometries are possible where curvature singularities appear at nite r
[15,16,32]. it is also possible that the geometry will have no singularities that are causally
connected to the boundary, but that a(r) never recovers linear behavior. the one general
restriction, which we will prove in section 4.2, is a(r)  0. this rules out a second anti-de
it is impossible to have a(r) approach a positive constant as r  
sitter boundary:
and a negative constant as r  . the monotonicity of a(r) implies a c-theorem, as
we shall see.



4.2. a c-theorem

the analysis of anomaly coecients in [27] applies to anti-de sitter spaces adsd for
 i appears in the supergravity

any odd bulk dimension d. the anomalous value of ht 

13

analysis because the cuto r = r0 does not respect dieomorphism invariance. dierent
choices of radial variable (including those which mix the coordinates r and x in (4.1))
correspond to dierent but conformally equivalent boundary metrics  . the general
result of [27] is

ht 

 i =

universal
ad2

,

(4.2)

where the universal part is the same for all theories, and is a curvature invariant involving
d  1 derivatives of the boundary metric. no such invariant exists in odd boundary
dimensions. the denominator of (4.2) actually appears in the analysis of [27] as the

inverse radius of the anti-de sitter space, and no particular coordinate choice is implied.
expressing this inverse radius as a is merely a convenience.

the metric

ds2 = e2a(r) (  dxdx )  dr2 ,

(4.3)

where  is ricci at, has a ricci tensor whose nonvanishing components are

r = e2a(r) (cid:2)a + (d  1)(a)2(cid:3)  ,

rrr = (d  1)(cid:2)a + (a)2(cid:3) .

(4.4)

we note that

(d  2)a = rt

t  rr

r = gt

t  gr

r = 2

d(t t

r ) ,

(4.5)

where d is the d-dimensional gravitational constant and in the last equality we have used
einsteins equations, g = 2
dt. note that we are including any cosmological constant
as a term in t proportional to g. the stress tensor that supports the geometry (4.3)
has the form t 
 = diag{, p1, p2, . . . , pd2, pr}. the dominant energy condition for stress
tensors of this form is precisely   |pi| for all i [33].1 in our case,  = pi for all pi except
pr. we would have  = pr as well if and only if the stress-tensor consists of a cosmological
constant contribution and nothing elseand then we recover perfect anti-de sitter space,

so there is no rg ow at all.

consider an illustrative example: suppose we had an action

(4.7)

which is positive because mij is positive denite. the scalar potentials contribution to

r cancels.

our example is general enough to cover any ow in gauged supergravity involving
only the scalar elds and the metric. (it seems dicult to preserve poincare invariance on
the boundary if one turns on any bulk matter elds with spin). but (4.5), together with
the assumption of the dominant energy condition, constitutes an even more general proof
that the quantity

c(r) = c0

ad2

(4.8)

is non-increasing along the ow toward the infrared. the parameter, c0, is a constant.

the result (4.2) shows that if the geometry is anti-de sitter, then the anomaly coe-
cients of the corresponding conformal eld theory are proportional to c. with appropriate
denitions of those anomaly coecients and of c0, we can say that c coincides with the
anomaly coecients for anti-de sitter geometries. in the duality of n = 4 su (n ) super-
yang-mills theory with n = 8 gauged supergravity, one can show that

c(r) =

g3n 2/32
a(r)3

(4.9)

is the appropriate normalization to give c = a = c = n 2
for the unperturbed maximally
supersymmetric anti-de sitter vacuum of the supergravity theory, and c = a = c = 27
128 n 2
for the one-quarter supersymmetric vacuum found in [8]. in (4.9), g is the gauge coupling
in the ve-dimensional supergravity, and it has units of energy. the important thing to
realize is that once we have xed c0 within a particular supergravity theory, the formula
(4.8) gives a uniform prescription for computing the anomaly coecients in any conformal
theory dual to an anti-de sitter vacuum of that supergravity theory.

4

now we want to consider a kink spacetime which is asymptotic to anti-de sitter spaces
for r  . the analysis of [27] does not apply directly to such a spacetime. but its
asymptotic limits as r   are anti-de sitter vacua, and we can think of obtaining the
uv and ir anomaly coecients for these vacua from (4.8). to apply the analysis of [27]
directly we must lift out one asymptotically anti-de sitter end from the kink and make

15

it into an exactly anti-de sitter spacetime. but the answer for c is exactly the same as
if we had evaluated limr c(r) in the original non-anti-de sitter kink geometry. this
is precisely analogous to the situation in eld theory: properties pertaining narrowly to a
given xed point do not depend on a particular ow that leads into it or out of it; such
properties can be studied just as well by considering the trivial ow which remains forever

at the xed point.

it is dicult or impossible to give a scheme-independent denition of the central

charge away from conformal xed points. flows may exist which pass arbitrarily close to
one xed point on their way to another. for these a scaling region exists where a is
much larger than higher derivatives of a. the function, c(r), in such a region is close to
the anomaly coecient of the nearby xed point.

in [35], the monotonicity of the c-function followed trivially from the fact that the

rg ow was the gradient ow of the c-function. in general it seems dicult to prove any
analog of that statement in four dimensions. however, for supersymmetric supergravity
kinks, an analogous statement can be proven: as we will explain in section 5, a can be
expressed as a function of the scalar elds (without derivatives), and the trajectory of the
scalars throughout the ow is specied by gradient ow of that function.

our proof of a holographic c-theorem also applies to ows such as the one envisaged
in [29], where light string states from twisted sectors are involved. in addition, it would

apply to ows involving any or all of the massive kaluza-klein states arising from any
compactication of ten-dimensional supergravity down to ve-dimensions. it even applies
if the matter lagrangian includes higher derivative terms, provided the dominant energy

condition continues to hold. however, the proof does rely on einsteins equations. it would
be interesting to explore whether the argument can be extended to cover the alterations
in the gravitational action that arise through  corrections. we should also add that the
inequality a  0 turned out to be exactly the dominant energy condition on the stress-
tensor supporting the geometry, so if consistent matter violating the dominant energy
condition exists in the bulk in a regime where the classical gravity approximation is valid,

it seems likely that one could use it to construct holographically a boundary theory which
violates the c-theorem.

in summary, we seem to have a dimension-independent proof of a c-theorem from the

dominant energy condition. it applies to theories where a gravity dual can be found in
which einsteins equations hold, and in which the gravity approximation applies. besides

the obvious large n , strong coupling restrictions, this also amounts in four dimensions to
the restriction a  c = 0, at least to leading order in large n . (the 1/n corrections were

16

explored in [36,37].) the proof of the theorem, equation (4.5), is appropriately trivial for
such a general truth.

there have been other recent eorts toward a c-theorem in higher dimensions: [38,39]
take a eld theoretic approach, [34] works with thermodynamic quantities, and [40] uses the

ads/cft correspondence. when this work was complete, we learned that an equivalent
form of the c-function in (4.9) was discussed in a recent revision of [17].2 monotonicity
was not proven.

5. supersymmetric ows

to make the correspondence between the supergravity theory and the boundary theory
on the brane more complete, one should be able to nd the ow between the central
critical point with maximal supersymmetry and the n = 2 supersymmetric critical points
described in section 3.2. in particular one should be able to preserve n = 1 supersymmetry
on the branes all along the ow, i.e., the kink should itself be supersymmetric. thus we

once again study the killing spinor conditions, i.e. the vanishing of (3.10), but the metric
now takes the form (4.1) and the scalars depend on r. the vanishing of abc directly
relates r derivatives of the scalars to the gradient of w . specically, to solve abc = 0 we
nd that we must rst set  = 0. there are then two classes of supersymmetry preserving
kink solutions that are related by 1  2. here we will describe the family that contains
the ow to (3.11). we will use the same -matrix conventions as [6].

for an unbroken supersymmetry along the ow of the form

a = (cid:0)va

1 + va

1 r(cid:1) ea(r)/2 ,

(5.1)

1 and va

1 are given in (3.3) and  is a constant spinor, the vanishing of abc

where va
requires:

dj

2

w

,

(5.2)

where w = 1|=0 (see (3.4)). one can show that for such an a to satisfy the symplectic-
majorana condition in ve dimensions,  must be a majorana spinor in the four dimensions
of the brane. to verify this one uses: abvb
1 , where  is the u sp(8)
symplectic form. one also needs the fact that the four-dimensional charge conjugation
matrix, c, may be written as c = rc, where c is the ve-dimensional charge conjugation

1 = va

1 , abvb

1 = va

2 we thank a. zaaroni for bringing this work to our attention.

17

matrix. as a result, we see that the kink preserves a single, four-dimensional majorana
supersymmetry, i.e. the ow preserves n = 1 supersymmetry on the brane. mathematica
was again essential to deduce the simple result (5.2) from the 48 conditions abc = 0.

the vanishing of va

1 a and va

1 a yields one more equation:

a = 

g
3

w .

(5.3)

one can easily verify that a solution to the rst order equations (5.2) and (5.3) automat-
ically satises both the gravitational and scalar equations of motion arising from (3.6),
(3.9) and (3.5).

the other family of supersymmetric kinks is obtained by taking w = 2|=0, and

replacing v1, v1 by v2, v2. the conclusions are otherwise identical.

as promised in section 4.2, we have produced a function of the scalars, w , which is

related to the c-function by

c(r) =

27
32

n 2

|w|3 ,

(5.4)

and whose gradient ow trajectories determine the scalar proles in the supergravity kink.
since the scalars are viewed in the ads/cft correspondence essentially as parameters
in the lagrangian, we can assert that the supersymmetric renormalization group ow is
gradient ow. the monotonicity of a is of course a trivial consequence: using (5.3) and
(5.2) one obtains

a = 

g2

r (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 0 .

(5.5)

the monotonicity of a is related to the local potential energy of the superkink. perhaps
more fundamentally, recall that the value of the superpotential at either end of a kink may
be thought of as determining the topological sector [41].3 thus the change in c(r) as r
goes from large positive values (the ultraviolet) to large negative values (the infrared) is a
measure of the topological charge of the superkink.

3 unlike standard kinks, where a eld ows from one minimum of a potential to another, our
kink ows from a local maximum of the gauged supergravity potential to a saddle point. as long

as there are relevant perturbations in the gauge theory, there will always be directions in the

potential where the second derivative is negative, but that does not spoil stability of the saddle

point vacuum in supergravity provided the breitenlohner-freedman bound is satised. instead of

using nite total energy to restrict the asymptotic behavior of the kink, we can use the requirement

that there be no naked singularities. with this criterion our kink is locally unique.

18

note there are innitely many supersymmetry preserving solutions starting at the
point of maximal supersymmetry, j = 0,  = 0. most of these solutions go to w  ,
and it requires the correct initial conditions to reach the non-trivial supersymmetric critical
point. to get to (3.11) one rst takes 2 = 0, which is consistent with the equations of
motion since w

2|2=0. the superpotential then reduces to

w =

1

42 h cosh(21) (6  2)  (36 + 2)i .

(5.6)

the contour maps of v and w on the ( = 16
3, 1) parameter space are shown in
figure 3. the map of v shows ve extrema. point 1 is the maximally supersymmetric
point. it is a local maximum of both v and w . points 2 and 3 are zz2 equivalent su (3)
invariant points.
in the 1 direction these points sit at a quadratic minimum of v ; in
the 3 direction they sit on a cubic inection point. points 4 and 5 are zz2 equivalent
n = 2 supersymmetric points. these points are generic quadratic saddle points of both v
and w , and the contours surrounding them are locally hyperbolas. the superkink which
we study follows a path from the central maximum of w down the ridge to the saddle
point labelled 4. we have been unable to nd an analytic solution to the steepest descent
equations, but we will discuss a numerical solution as well as analytic treatments of the
endpoints at the end of this section.

the mass scale is set by the inverse radius, 1/, of the ads space, and this may be written
3 w , where we have used (3.5). for  = 0 the matrix uij is real and
symmetric, and so has real eigenvalues, k, k = 1, 2, 3. it follows that the eigenvalues of
2m 2

is related to the conformal dimension k of the eld theory operator dual to the variation
of the elds j in the corresponding eigen-direction either by k = k or k = 4  k.

since u = ea(r) is the renormalization scale on the ow, we should be able to read

where we have expanded to rst order in the neighborhood of a critical point, and where
ujk is dened in (5.7).4 the eigenvalues, j , of ujk thus determine the behavior of the
scalars j near the critical points. first, to depart the uv xed point (u = +) the ow
must take place in directions in which the eigenvalues are positive (i.e. the corresponding
operators must be relevant), and to approach the ir xed point (u  0) the eigenvalues
must be negative (i.e. the corresponding operators must be irrelevant). at the central
critical point, the eigenvalues are k = 1, 2, 3, corresponding to 1, 3, 2. since 2  0 on
this ow, only the eigenspaces of eigenvalue 1 and 2 are used. the supergravity elds 1

4 we regard u = ea(r) as a natural measure of energy scale because of the conformal factor
e2a(r) in the metric (4.1). other denitions have been proposed [31]. for instance, u could be
taken as the inverse of the coordinate time t it takes for a light ray to propagate to a given radius.

this gives u =(cid:0)r

the cubic term is of the same order as the quadratic terms. we must keep this term even
in a lowest-order analysis of the behavior of 3. the correct analysis of the asymptotics is

it is straightforward to verify that higher order terms in (5.10) do not change this story:
roughly speaking, two powers of 1 are worth one power of 3 in the expansion of w . the
integration constant a0 is, up to factors of order unity, the fermion mass resulting from
the term 1
3 in the superpotential (see (2.1)). supersymmetry xes the value of the
coecient of re2r in the asymptotics of 3. this coecient, again up to factors of order
unity, is the square of the boson mass resulting from the mass term in the superpotential.
the integration constant a1 is not determined by supersymmetry, and reects the possi-
bility of dierent states in the theory, only one of which is the vacuum which preserves
conformal invariance. we do not yet have a way of determining a1 analytically, but we
will shortly discuss its numerical evaluation.

the ow near the ir critical point (3.11) is a little simpler. the eigenvalues, k, of

uij are 1 + 7, 1  7, 3. the only negative one is 1  7, and so the corresponding

eigenvector determines the direction from which the ow approaches the xed point. the

the irrelevant operator in the eld theory that controls this ow has dimension 3 + 7.
because of the possibility of shifting r additively, the coecients a0, a1, and b0 are not
all independently meaningful. the two combinations that are invariant are b0a

a numerical solution interpolating between (5.11) and (5.12) is easier to nd if one

starts from the infrared end. then the dierential equations are stable in that a small per-

from the ultraviolet end to the infrared end, which is appropriate since relevant deforma-

tions become more important in the infrared. our results for the invariant combinations

6. supergravity fields and the operator map

the symmetries of the supersymmetric critical point [8] in ads5 include n = 2 super-
symmetry and the gauge symmetry su (2)i, so the supergravity elds should be classied
in representations of the corresponding superalgebra su (2, 2|1) su (2)i. the ads/cft
correspondence requires a one to one map between these elds and gauge invariant compos-
ite operators of the boundary theory, in this case the mass deformed n = 4 super-yang-
in n = 1 superspace this theory contains a chiral
mills theory discussed in section 2.

in this section we will discuss the spectrum of elds in bulk supergravity theory and
propose a map to operators of the boundary theory. some aspects of the corresponding

22

unitary representations of su (2, 2|1) [42,43] are summarized in appendix b with a brief
discussion at the end of this section.

the main technical task is to study the action of the gauged supergravity theory of
[6,7] expanded to quadratic order about the n = 2 critical point and to compute the
mass eigenvalues of all elds. this is an unfortunately complex matter. the general

approach is discussed in appendix a, but details reside in the privacy of our mathematica

notebooks, which shall remain sealed until the statute of limitations expires. we will give
the decompositions of supergravity elds  which transform under u sp(8)  su (4) in the
full theory  with respect to the unbroken gauge subgroup su (2)i  u (1)r at the critical
point. this will help readers understand the group-theoretic structure of the results. the

detailed masses, however, depend crucially upon accurate calculation of the scalar 27-bein
ab at the critical point and of the u sp(8) tensors wab and aabcd, which are given by

computation of the masses of scalar elds requires quadratic expansions of those tensors

about the critical point, and a similarly complicated determination of the kinetic term.

lagrangian (6.2) which can thus be dropped in this gauge. the action on the space of
remaining elds has no mixing between the spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 elds and it is clear that
the remaining spin-3/2 part of the lagrangian is not modied in the process.

the nal diagonalization of the spin-3/2 action can be described quite explicitly.
since the kinetic term is already in the canonical form, all that remains is to diagonalize
the symmetric matrix wab, which at the critical point is given in (a.42).

the diagonalization of the action for the remaining 42 spin-1/2 elds is more involved
and we have carried it out in mathematica using formulae from appendix a. as with
spin-3/2, the symplectic majorana condition requires that the masses occur in pairs m.

6.2. the boson masses

the computation of the masses of the vector elds, aij

 , and the antisymmetric tensor

gives rise to the kinetic term for the vectors, but the mass term for the antisymmetric
tensors,6 and is the only source of cross-terms. at the quadratic level the chern-simons

thus the mass eigenvalues of the vector elds are modied.

jk is chosen to remove the cross terms. in this process the kinetic term and

the decomposition of the vector elds with respect to su (4)  su (2)i  u (1)r is

15  30  10  (23/2  23/2)  (21/2  21/2)  (11  11)  10 .

(6.11)

one expects that all but the rst two modes, corresponding to unbroken gauge symmetries,

become massive. as we have discussed above, the actual values of the masses are eected

by the mixing with the antisymmetric tensor elds. however, the usual higgs eect, in
which 11 massless goldstone bosons are eaten by the massive vector elds, does not directly

aect the calculation. therefore the masses can be determined from (6.8) once the proper

shift (6.10) has been made.

since the antisymmetric tensor elds have a rst order action, their masses come in

m pairs corresponding to the terms in the su (2)i  u (1)r decomposition

12  2  (21/2  21/2)  2  (11  11) .

(6.12)

6 this observation may be rather puzzling at the rst sight  it is, however, quite natural since
the antisymmetric tensors correspond to eld strengths of vector elds in the ungauged theory

[5,6,7].

25

as for the vectors, the main diculty here is to compute the metric (vv)i j that encodes
the dependence of the masses on the expectation values of the scalar elds.

the calculation of masses of the scalar elds presents additional diculty if one wants

to consider the full set of 42 elds, rather than the restricted subset corresponding to the
gauge xed subspace of the scalar manifold s discussed in section 3. in the general case one
must calculate carefully both the -model kinetic action at the critical point and expand

the potential to the quadratic order in all directions. the calculation can be simplied by
restricting to dierent sectors of su (2)i  u (1)r, one at a time, which in this case are
given by the branching

42  30  2  (31  31)  (23/2  23/2)  3  (21/2  21/2)

2  (12  12)  (11  11)  5  10 .

(6.13)

by carrying out a careful diagonalization we nd a perfect agreement of the mass spectrum

with this decomposition. in particular, the result displays 13 massless states of which the
two real su (2)i singlets are the dilaton and the axion and the remaining 11 are the
goldstone bosons from the breaking su (4)  su (2)i  u (1)r. their quantum numbers
are in agreement with those of massive vectors in (6.11).

6.3. the su (2, 2|1) spectrum and the operator map

the ultimate test of our result for the mass spectrum is to verify that it can be
assembled into irreducible unitary representations of the superalgebra su (2, 2|1)su (2)i.
the relevant representations of su (2, 2|1) are parametrized by the energy e0 = ,
of the lowest weight state, equal to the scaling dimension of the corresponding boundary
operator, the two spins j1 and j2 and the r-charge, r. these quantum numbers designate
a representation of the bosonic subalgebra u (1)  su (2)  su (2)  u (1) where the rst
and last u (1) factors are the energy and r-symmetry, respectively. the relation between

 and the mass for various elds may, for example, be found in [45] for d = 4. in general,
for adsd+1, the relations are

(i) scalars [3]:  = 1
(ii) spinors [46]:  = 1

(iii) vectors:  = 1
(iv) p-forms [47]:  = 1

2 (d  d2 + 4m2),
2 (d + 2|m|),
2 (d p(d  2)2 + 4m2),
2 (d p(d  2p)2 + 4m2),

26

(v) rst-order (d/2)-forms (d even):7  = 1

2 (d + 2|m|),

(vi) spin-3/2 [50,51]:  = 1

2 (d + 2|m|),

(vii) massless spin-2 [3]:  = d.

we have converted results for mass eigenvalues of all uctuations into scale dimensions

by the formulas. results are tabulated in tables 6.1 and 6.2 in which each horizontal band
corresponds to a representation of the product of su (2, 2|1) with the su (2)i avor symme-
try. the detailed structure of these su (2, 2|1) representations is given in appendix b, and
the entry in the tables denotes the lowest weight energy and the su (2)i  u (1)r quantum
numbers at each level. in all but one case we take  = +, the largest root given above.
the unique exception is the complex scalar triplet with  =  = 3/2. this assignment
is required by the well known relation  = 3r/2 for n = 1 chiral primary operators and,
of course, by the structure of the su (2, 2|1) representation. the choice  =  was made
for similar reasons in another recent study [52] of the ads/cft correspondence. it is also
known that the chiral multiplet in ads4 supersymmetry requires quantization with both
regular and irregular boundary conditions [53] when scalar masses are in the range
d2/4 < m2 < 1  d2/4. see [54] for a discussion valid in adsd+1.

the short representations and corresponding superelds8 are listed in table 6.1. they
are either chiral, and thus satisfy  = 3r/2 for the lowest component, or they have

protected dimensions because the multiplet contains one or more conserved component
for example, the su (2) avor current in tr t a, and the u (1)r current,
operators:
supercurrent, and stress tensor in the supercurrent supereld j . since the massive eld
3 is eectively integrated out in the ow, the ir theory contains the massless chiral
superelds i , i = 1, 2 with  = 3/4 and r = 1/2 and the gauge superelds w with
 = 3/2 and r = 1. we see that the short multiplets found from ads5 supergravity
contain all bilinears formed from these elds, all with correct quantum numbers. this is

a striking conrmation of the validity of the correspondence in a new and more complex

theory.

the rst long multiplet in table 6.2 is a massive vector representation of su (2, 2|1)
with irrational and clearly unprotected . we use the designation k(x, , ) to indicate
that it corresponds to a general scalar supereld in the boundary theory.

7 see [48] for d = 4. entry (v) is for forms with rst order actions [49], while entries (iii) and

(iv) are for forms with maxwell type actions, possibly augmented by mass terms.

8 the relation between su (2, 2|1) representations and boundary superelds in the context of

the ads/cft correspondence has recently been discussed in [55,56].

table 6.1: the ve short su (1, 1|2) representations in the mass spectrum of supergravity elds

at the n = 2 critical point and the corresponding n = 1 superelds in the boundary gauge

theory. for each complex representation above there is an additional representation with the

same dimension, spin and su (2)i content, but opposite u (1)r charge.

the existence of long multiplets of su (2, 2|1) in the supergravity spectrum should
not come as a surprise. in fact, in [28] it was suggested that for the kaluza-klein com-
pactication of ten-dimensional type iib supergravity on the t 11 coset manifold (which
again leads to a supergravity geometry with su (2, 2|1) symmetry), only a small fraction of
operators will have rational dimensions. the fraction is on the order 1/2 for operators of

dimension less than or equal to some large maximum, . in supergravity, the many elds

of irrational but nite dimension arise from a kaluza-klein compactication on a manifold
of smaller isometry than s5. in eld theory, the natural interpretation is simply to say that
the smaller su (2, 2|1) algebra protects fewer operators than su (2, 2|4). the outstanding
puzzle is why the operators dual to supergravity elds in long multiplets should retain

nite dimensions while the operators dual to excited string states acquire dimensions on
the order (g2

y m n )1/4.

we would like to identify the scalar supereld k(x, , ) with an operator in the gauge
theory. we speculate that it is the kahler potential. this is a sensible guess because the

kahler potential evolves in the rg ow, and the scalar eld that measures the approach
of our trajectory to the n = 1 point sits in the supergravity multiplet dual to k(x, , ).
this scalar eld has a dimension 3 + 7 in the infrared.

29

the lowest weight states of the remaining long multiplets have spin 1/2 and maximum
spin 3/2. we assign them to boundary operators which are non-chiral spinor superelds
i(x, , ) and (x, , ). the natural candidates for these operators are the 3 super-
currents of the n = 4 theory which are explicitly broken by the mass term in (2.1). in
the absence of the mass term the 3 extended supercurrents are components of the n = 1
su (3) triplet supereld9

where d is the gauge and supercovariant derivative. we suggest that i and  are
the i = 1, 2 and i = 3 components of this supereld, respectively, and we note that the
r-charges agree with this assignment. the scale dimensions  generally disagree with the
naive sum of those of the elementary elds as is expected for non-chiral operators.

the two massive spin-3/2 representations have strikingly dierent component struc-
ture, for example i contains a scalar component, but  does not. we have conrmed in
appendix b that these representations are characterized by null or shortening conditions
which eliminate states, specically the condition 2e0 = 4(j2 + 1) + 3r with j2 = 0 for 
and 2e0 = 4(j2 + 1) + 3r with j2 = 1
2 for i. thus they have a protected structure in the
same sense in which a chiral supereld with 2e0 = 3r is protected. the structure of these
representations suggests they should not be called long representations, but perhaps semi-
long. the detailed correspondence between the supergravity elds which are components
of these representations and the components of the superelds si
 is left here as a curious
open question.

although the detailed analysis of the representations of table 6.2 is given in ap-
pendix b, it is worth remarking here that their structures can be described in terms of
the higgs eect in which a massless multiplet of su (2, 2|1), which contains a component
gauge eld, eats a lower spin multiplet. the massless representations are listed in table 5
of [6]. the states of the massive vector multiplet we have called k in table 6.2 are exactly
those of a massless vector multiplet plus a hypermultiplet10 in which one of the 4 real
scalars is eaten. a massive spin-3/2 eld has the choice of eating a spin-1/2 eld from a
vector or antisymmetric tensor multiplet. the states of the  representation are those
of a massless gravitino multiplet plus a tensor multiplet with one spin-1/2 eld and one
scalar eaten to make its massive higher spin components. on the other hand the states of
the i representation are those of a gravitino plus vector plus lh spinor multiplet with a
spinor and two scalars eaten. we have already seen that no higgs mechanism is required
to make an antisymmetric tensor massive.

9 we thank m. grisaru for this information.
10 a hypermultiplet is the direct sum of a lh and rh spinor multiplet in the notation of [6].

7. n = 4 supergravity

thus far, our explicit analysis of the su (2)i invariant subsector of gauged n =
8 supergravity has focussed largely upon the scalar manifold. we now return to the
consideration of the n = 4 supergravity theory associated with the su (2)i invariant
subsector of the complete n = 8 theory.

the n = 4 supergravity in ve dimensions was rst considered in [57], but was only
really explicitly described in [58]. the latter reference also considers the coupling to an

arbitrary number, m, of vector multiplets, and goes on to discuss the gauged theory with
an su (2) gauge group. various gaugings of pure n = 4 supergravity (i.e. not coupled to
vector or tensor multiplets) were also considered in [59].

the eld content of the n = 4 graviton multiplet is one gravitino, four gravitinos,
2 elds and a single, real scalar. the content of the n = 4 vector
2 elds and ve real scalars. the scalar manifold of the

six vectors, four spin- 1
multiplet is: one vector, four spin- 1
supergravity coupled to m vector multiplets is:

so(5, m)

so(5)  so(m)  so(1, 1) ,

where the factor of so(1, 1) represents the scalar of the graviton multiplet.

if one truncates the ungauged n = 8 theory to the singlets of su (2)i one gets precisely
n = 4 supergravity coupled to two n = 4 vector multiplets. however the truncation of
the so(6) gauged supergravity yields something a little dierent from that of [58] because
the residual gauge group is su (2)g u (1)g and not just su (2). the gauging of the extra
u (1) appears to require the dualization of some of the vector elds into tensor gauge elds

just as in [6]. one can easily determine the eld content and compute the structure of the
eld theory by truncation the results of [6] to the su (2)i singlet sector. indeed, the four
vectors (3.3) can be used to project the u sp(8) structure appropriately. to be explicit:
(i) the gravitinos of the n = 8 theory transform 4  4 of su (4). under su (2)i 
su (2)g  u (1)g, one has 4 = (2, 1)(+ 1
2 ). thus there are four gravitinos
that are singlets under this su (2)i, transforming as 2( 1
2 ) of su (2)gu (1)g.
they are explicitly given by the inner products of (3.3) and the n = 8 gravitinos.
the supersymmetries decompose similarly.

2 ) (1, 2)( 1

2 )2(+ 1

(ii) the vector elds are in the 15 of su (4) and the su (2)i singlets are simply the adjoints

of su (2)g  u (1)g.

31

(iii) the tensor gauge elds are in an sl(2, ir) doublet of 6s of su (4): and each member
of the sl(2, ir) doublet gives rise to two tensor gauge elds that are singlets of su (2)g
but have charges of 1 under u (1)g.

(iv) the spin- 1

2 elds are in the following representations of su (2)g  u (1)g: 2( 3

2 ) 

2(+ 3

2 )  2  2( 1

2 )  2  2(+ 1
2 )

(v) the eleven scalars were described above.

putting this together, the theory consists of an n = 4 graviton supermultiplet and
two n = 4 tensor gauge super multiplets. the former has: one graviton, four gravitinos,
four vector elds, two tensor gauge elds, four spin- 1
2 elds, and one real scalar. the tensor
gauge multiplet has the same spin- 1

2 and scalar content as an n = 4 vector multiplet.

the truncation process can be viewed in two ways. mathematically one is identifying

a subset of elds whose lagrangian and equations of motion involve only those elds, and

such that any solution of the truncated equations of motion can be lifted to a solution of the

untruncated equations of motion. perhaps the simplest way of nding such a truncation

is by restricting to the elds that are singlets under some particular symmetry (here it
is su (2)i), and then schurs lemma guarantees consistency with the equations of motion
of the untruncated theory. physically the truncated theory can be taken as a new eld

theory in its own right, and it is consistent and well-dened at least at the classical level.

or one can regard it as part of the original (or perhaps another) larger eld theory.

naively, one might hope that the n = 4 truncation of gauged n = 8 supergravity
corresponds to a truncation of n = 4 yang-mills to its su (2)i singlet sector. however, the
su (2)i invariant subsector of n = 4 yang-mills is simply a pure n = 2 yang-mills theory,
which is not a superconformal eld theory, and so cannot, by itself be holographically dual
to the n = 4 supergravity theory. the error in this naive hope is that fundamental elds
of supergravity are not dual to fundamental elds of yang-mills, and so one must proceed
in other words, the truncation to the su (2)i invariant sector must be
applied to the gauge invariant composite operators rather than to the fundamental colored

more carefully.

elds themselves.

there are however many ways to build a superconformal eld theory around the same
set of su (2)i invariant composite operators dual to the truncated n = 4 supergravity
theory. the focus of this paper has been on adding adjoint hypermultiplets to make the
n = 4 theory, however there also the n = 2 superconformal gauge theories whose gauge
groups and matter multiplets are encoded in an ade quiver diagram [21]. using the
d-brane formulation of n = 4 yang-mills theory one can make an orbifold construction

32

[60,22] using a nite subgroup  of su (2)i. these nite subgroups also have an ade
classication, and indeed the ade orbifold leads to the corresponding ade n = 2 quiver
theory. the common subsector of all these conformal eld theories is the  invariant
gauge-singlet operators, corresponding holographically to untwisted closed string states.
this is in a sense the n = 2 yang-mills core of the theory.
it is thus tempting to
identify this universal subsector of the conformal eld theories as the holographic dual
of n = 4 supergravity coupled to two tensor multiplets. inclusion of the twisted sectors
may involve further coupling to additional n = 4 supermultiplets. the truncated n = 4
supergravity is dual to the stress tensor of the full superconformal eld theory plus its
superpartners under n = 2 superconformal invariance.

to see more explicitly how this should work, observe that the 11 scalars of n = 4
supergravity coupled to two tensor multiplets provides precisely the proper moduli of
the n = 2 yang-mills vector multiplet: that is, the gauge coupling, the -angle, a real,
symmetric 2 2 mass matrix for the two real scalars and a complex, symmetric 2 2 mass
matrix for the two complex fermions. the su (2) u (1) r-symmetry can then be used to
reduce the nine mass parameters to ve, and these can be represented by diagonal mass

matrices with real traces. the u (1) axial symmetry can be used to reduce this by one
further parameter, leaving four independent mass perturbations, which correspond to the
four independent scalars described in [8].

if n = 4 supergravity coupled to two n = 4 tensor multiplets does indeed provide
the common core of all the quiver models, then the scalar manifold, s considered in [8]
is not only part of the phase diagram of n = 4 yang-mills, but is that part of the phase
diagram that is common to n = 4 yang-mills and to all the n = 2 quiver theories. the
critical points and ows described here would thus also be common to all these theories.

appendix a. su (2) invariant scalar manifolds in n = 8 supergravity

in this appendix we review the construction of the su (2) invariant sectors of the
scalar manifold of n = 8 d = 5 gauged supergravity which played a central role in [8]. in
particular, we derive an explicit parametrization of the manifold s in section 3 and collect
some explicit formulae which are used in the computation of the mass spectra in section 6.
the scalar elds in n = 8 supergravity are described by a non-linear -model on
the non-compact coset space e6(6)/u sp(8) [57]. in the gauged theory [5,6,7] the global
symmetry group e6(6) is broken to an so(6) subgroup, which then becomes the local
gauge symmetry group of the theory. the authors of [8] considered those scalar eld
congurations which are invariant under an su (2) subgroup of so(6) that we call su (2)i.
let c be the commutant of su (2)i in e6(6) and k  c the maximal compact subgroup
of c. then the reduced scalar manifold s corresponding to a given su (2)i is

s  c/k  e6(6)/u sp(8) .

(a.1)

the commutant of su (2)i in so(6) is the group of residual gauge transformations on s,
which will be denoted by g.

the scalar potential, v , restricted to the elds in s, is invariant under the residual
gauge symmetry, g, and, in addition, under sl(2, ir) of the ten-dimensional theory. be-
cause of this invariance the potential restricted to s actually depends on a reduced number
of independent parameters, denoted by dim v which is less than dim s.

there are four inequivalent embeddings of su (2)i  so(6) corresponding to the

following branchings of the fundamental and the vector representations of so(6):

(i)

(ii)

4  2  1  1 ,

4  4 ,

6  2  2  1  1 ;
6  3  1  1  1 ;
6  3  3 ;
6  5  1 .

the resulting scalar manifolds, s, are summarized in table a.1. one should note that this
table gives the local geometry of s, but does not capture discrete symmetries that might
be present.

given an explicit realization of e6(6),

it is rather straightforward to derive a
parametrization of s once the subgroup su (2)i has been identied. we will illustrate
this for case (i), which is the relevant one for this paper. other cases can be worked out
similarly.

and by the standard properties of the non-compact cosets [61] has global coordinates xi,

to dene the 27-bein on s we introduce yet another basis, zab, a, b = 1, . . . , 8, trans-
forming in the 27 of u sp(8). it is dened in terms of the sl(6, ir)  sl(2, ir) basis by

(a.32)

in general, the potential, v , is invariant under the grgl group of local transforma-
tions of the 27-bein, where gr = u sp(8) and gl = so(6)  sl(2, ir). upon restriction
to the scalar submanifold, s, a subgroup of those transformations

d  gdg1p ,

(a.33)

preserves s and leaves v invariant. the transformations in g act linearly on xi and yi.
in terms of the 5  2 matrix (x, y) in (a.23) this action is schematically of the form

(x, y)  (cid:18) rso(3)

rso(2)(cid:19) (x, y)(rso(2)) ,

(a.34)

where the so(3) subgroup are the so(5, 2) rotations in the (123)-hyperplane, the so(2)
are the rotations in the (45)-plane and so(2), which rotates (xi, yi) as a doublet, are the
rotations in the (67)-plane. the group of residual gauge transformations, g, in table a.1
consists of so(3) and a diagonal so(2) in so(2) so(2) above. another combination of
the so(2) rotations is a part of sl(2, ir). an innitesimal action of p , the noncomapct
generators of sl(2, ir), with parameters 1 and 2 on (x, y) is given by

(a.35)

it was argued in [8] that using those invariances one may set all parameters, but x1, x4,
y2 and , to zero, thus reducing the dependence of the potential from 11 to 4 parameters.
this simplication allowed the authors of [8] to compute the potential explicitly in terms
of the variables rx, ry,  and , where

x1 = rx cos  ,

x4 = rx sin  ,

y2 = ry .

invariant under su (2)i  u (1)r subgroup of so(6), where the r-charge subgroup u (1)r

matrix m (x, y, ) at the critical point, when expressed in the sl(6, ir)  sl(2, ir) basis
using (a.26)-(a.28), is given by

appendix b. unitary multiplets of su (2, 2|1)

in this appendix we recall the classication of the unitary highest weight represen-
tations of the superalgebra su (2, 2|1) in [42,43] (see, also [62]) and work out explicitly
shortening patterns for the multiplets that are relevant for the discussion in section 6.

a unitary highest weight representation of su (2, 2|1) can be decomposed into a direct
sum of unitary highest weight representations of its bosonic subalgebra su (2, 2)  u (1).
the latter has a maximal compact subalgebra u (1) su (2) su (2) u (1), in which the
generator of the rst u (1) factor is the energy and that of the second is r-charge. the two
su (2) factors give the obvious so(4) subalgebra of su (2, 2)  so(4, 2). highest weight
representations, d(e0, j1, j2; r), of su (2, 2|1) are parametrized by the corresponding four
quantum numbers.

40

theorem [42,43]. a representation, d(e0, j1, j2; r), is unitary if and only if one of the
following conditions (i)-(iv) holds:
(i) e0  2j1  3
(ii) e0 =  3
(iii) e0 = 3

2 r + 2 for j1, j2  0,
2 r + 2 for j1 = 0 and j2  0,
2 r + 2 for j1  0 and j2 = 0,

2 r and e0  2j2 + 3
2 r and e0  2j1  3
(iv) e0 = r = 0 for j1 = j2 = 0.

2 r + 2 and e0  2j2 + 3

maximal representations (long multiplets) consist of the 16 representations of su (2, 2)
listed in the second column of table b.1, each with multiplicity 1. one may notice that
each representation in the multiplet is uniquely identied by its (j1, j2; r). the level in the
rst column of the table is the minimal number of supersymmetry operators that must be
applied to the vacuum to reach a given representation.

shorter multiplets arise when either j1j2 = 0, or, more interestingly, when some of
in the latter case some of
the equalities in the unitarity bounds (i)-(iii) are saturated.
the descendant su (2, 2) representations that are predicted by the tensor product rules
are missing. a complete list of shortening patterns is given in [42]. one can succinctly
summarize the structure of the resulting short modules as follows:

corollary. dene n (x) = 1 for x 6= 0 and n (0) = 0. let

s1 = n (j1) ,

s2 = n (j2) .

the multiplicities of the su (2, 2) representations in the decomposition of a unitary repre-
sentation, d(e0, j1, j2; r), are determined by (b.1), (b.2) and the appropriate products of
these numbers as given in table b.1.

the short multiplets in table 6.1 in section 6 are either chiral (complex) or non-chiral

2 r and j1 = 0 for the rh-multiplets,

2 r and j2 = 0 for the lh-multiplets.

(real). the shortening conditions for the chiral multiplets are:
(r) e0 =  3
(l) e0 = 3
we then have n(+)
2 = 0, respectively. for a generic value of e0, a lh-
multiplet is a direct sum of four su (2, 2) multiplets for j > 0 and three multiplets for
j = 0 as shown in table b.2. the rh-multiplets are obtained by (j1, j2)  (j2, j1) and
r  r.

table b.1: multiplicities of su (2, 2) representations in the decomposition of an

su (2, 2|1) unitary representation d(e0, j1, j2; r).

the non-chiral short multiplets are obtained by setting j1 = j2 = j, e0 = 2j + 1 and
r = 0 so that n()
2 = 0. the multiplet is shown in table b.3. for a complete list
of massless chiral and non-chiral short multiplets with spins not exceeding 2, we refer the

1 = n()

reader to, e.g., table 5 in [6].

the multiplet with irrational e0 found in section 6 is an example of a long repre-

sentation with only nine su (2, 2) representations because its vacuum representation has

j1 = j2 = 0.

finally, there are multiplets with the simplest type of shortening when only one van-

ishing condition holds, so that the resulting multiplet extends through four energy levels,

rather than three as in the case of the usual short multiplets. the dening vanishing
relation for the modules of this type which arise in section 6 are: e0 = 2j1  3
2 r + 2 or
e0 = 2j2 + 3
2 = 0. we will refer to them as
rh and lh semi-long multiplets. a typical lh-semi-long multiplet is of the form given in

2 r + 2, which is the same as n()

1 = 0 or n()

table b.4.

the corresponding rh-semi-long multiplet is obtained from the above by (j1, j2)  (j2, j1)
and r  r. once more there might be a further shortening of semi-short multiplets for
j1 or j2 equal zero. an example is the last multiplet in table 6.2.
