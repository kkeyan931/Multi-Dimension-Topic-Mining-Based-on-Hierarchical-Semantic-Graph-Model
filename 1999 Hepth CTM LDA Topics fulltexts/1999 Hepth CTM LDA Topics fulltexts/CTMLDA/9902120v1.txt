abstract

in this paper d-brane boundary states constructed in gepner models are used to

analyze some aspects of the dynamics of d0-branes in calabi-yau compactications of

type ii theories to four dimensions. it is shown that the boundary states correspond to

bps objects carrying dyonic charges. by analyzing the couplings to closed string elds

a correspondence between the d0-branes and extremal charged black holes in n = 2

supergravity is found.

1. introduction

dirichlet branes [1] provide a remarkably simple way to introduce extended objects
carrying ramond-ramond (rr) charges in string perturbation theory. one way to de-
scribe d-branes is given by the boundary state formalism [2][3]. here the open string
boundary conditions are imposed on the closed string elds. the boundary state formal-
ism is particularly useful in determining the coupling of the d-brane to the various closed
string modes.

the compactication of type ii string theories on calabi-yau threefolds (cy) yields
four-dimensional theories with n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry. this is an interesting
eld of study since these theories are not as strongly constrained as theories with more
supersymmetry. in addition they exhibit many of the phenomena which are central to the
recent developments in non-perturbative string theories such as mirror symmetry, f-theory
and heterotic duals (see [4] for a review).

the wrapping of dp-branes on p-dimensional supersymmetric cycles leads to bps
saturated non-perturbative objects. from the point of view of the four-dimensional non-
compacct space these objects are d0-branes, i.e. particle like states. for type iib on a
cy, d3-branes can wrap 3-cycles and for type iia on a cy, d0,d2,d4 and d6 branes can
wrap 0,2,4 and 6 cycles respectively. note that the ns ve-brane which is present in both
iia and iib cannot give any particle like states in four dimensions. the ns ve-brane will
however lead to non-perturbative corrections to the hypermultiplet geometry via euclidean
wrapping on the whole cy [5][6].

as we shall see the d0-branes are bps objects which are charged with respect to the
rr-vector elds. one aim of this paper is to show that they carry the same charges as ex-
tremal charged black holes in the n = 2 supergravity theory dened by the low energy limit
of the type ii string theory compactied on the cy. in the context of compactications
on t 6/z3 orbifolds this correspondence has been discussed in [7].

gepner models [8] are exactly solvable models for strings compactied on cy mani-
folds, where the internal c = 9 scft is constructed as an orbifold of a tensor product of
n = 2 minimal models. note that the geometrical description in sigma-model language
and the landau-ginzburg phase in which the gepner model resides can be connected via a
linear sigma-model [9]. it would be interesting to study wrapped d-branes in the context
of the linear sigma-model.

the construction of boundary conformal eld theories from bulk conformal eld
theories has been discussed by various people [10][11]. boundary cft has important
applications for impurity problems in condensed matter physics [12]. the construction of
consistent (rational) boundary conformal eld theories has been discussed by cardy [13].
additional sewing constraints for such theories have been discussed in [14][15]. cardys

boundary states have been used in [16] to construct boundary states in the gepner model
and some aspects of these boundary states were discussed further in [17]3.

in this paper we will use boundary states in gepner models to discuss the dynamics
of d0-branes in four dimensions. this analysis will be done by applying the well known
techniques developed for d-brane boundary states in ten-dimensional minkowski space to
the gepner model compactications.

2. boundary states in gepner models

the construction of boundary states for free bosons and fermions satisfying neumann
or dirichlet boundary conditions uses coherent states [2]. this construction was generalized
for rational cfts by ishibashi [10]. when the conformal eld theory forms an extended
algebra, boundary conditions have to be specied on the left- and right-moving currents of
the extended algebra w, w [10]. to construct boundary states for rational conformal eld
theories one rst denes ishibashi states | iii for every primary eld dening an irreducible
highest weight representation hi of the algebra which satisfy [10]

(cid:0)wn  (1)hw wn(cid:1) | iii = 0 .

(2.1)

in [10] it was shown that an ishibashi state can be constructed using an anti-unitary
operator u which acts on the modes of the right-moving current w in the following way,
u wnu 1 = (1)hw wn. such an operator u is closely related to the chiral cpt operator.
explicit form of the ishibashi state is given by

| iii =xn

| i, n i  u g| i, n i ,

(2.2)

where n denotes the sum over the basis of hi. in the second step a boundary state can
be constructed from a complete set of ishibashi states,

| a i =xi

ba
i | iii .

(2.3)

the form of possible boundary states | a i are constrained by the fact that the cylinder
amplitude involving two boundary states is mapped into a one-loop open string partition
function by a modular transformation. cardy [13] gives a solution in terms of the modular
s-matrix ba

i = sa

i /psa

0 .

3 gepner models in type i theory context were discussed in [18].

2

in [19][20], it was shown that two dierent boundary conditions for u (1) current j
and the superconformal generators g are consistent with n = 1 superconformal invari-
ance. the two cases are called a and b boundary conditions, referring to the two possible
topological twists of the n = 2 theory [21]. the a boundary conditions are dened by

(jn  jn) | b i = 0,

(g

r + i g

r) | b i = 0 ,

whereas the b boundary conditions are dened by

(jn + jn) | b i = 0,

(g

r + i g

r) | b i = 0 .

(2.4)

(2.5)

the choice of  = 1 corresponds to a choice of spin structure. due to the property of
the operator u the states (2.2) satisfy b-type boundary conditions. in order to implement
a-type boundary conditions u has to be replaced by u  [19][16], where  is the mirror
automorphism of the n = 2 algebra.

for four-dimensional compactications preserving n = 2 spacetime supersymmetry
the internal degrees of freedom form a c = 9 n = 2 scft. in the light-cone gauge the
external physical degrees of freedom are given by a c = 3 n = 2 scft consisting of a
free complex boson and fermion. the boundary conditions in the light-cone gauge have
been discussed in [17]. the results we need here are: firstly d0-brane boundary condi-
tions correspond to a-type boundary conditions for the external cft and secondly the
gso projection relates the internal and external boundary conditions where the consistent
internal boundary conditions for d0-branes are a-type for type iib and b-type for type
iia.

gepner models are exactly soluble string backgrounds in which the internal c = 9
scft is an orbifold of a tensor product of n = 2 minimal models. appendix a gives a
brief overview on the most important facts needed in this paper. in [16] boundary states
in gepner models corresponding to total a and b boundary conditions were constructed
by applying cardys construction [13] for each factor of the tensor product of n minimal
n = 2 theories.

the ishibashi states are labelled by the quantum numbers for the external part and
the internal n = 2 primaries, which we denote by  = (s0; m1,    , mn; s1,    , sn) and
 = (l1,    , ln). for a-type boundary conditions for each minimal model, the ishibashi
states have the form | , ; , ii. whereas for b-type boundary conditions the ishibashi
states have the form | , ; , ii.

in the following we will focus on the a-type boundary conditions for the internal

c = 9 scft, which corresponds to d0-branes in type iib.

the boundary states (2.6) are constructed using two types of data, rstly the gluing
automorphism [16](i.e. u and u ), and secondly the set of b
,. it would be interesting to
explore the possible generalizations of these boundary states. one possibility involves more
general automorphisms of the chiral fusion algebra (a very simple example are permutations
of minimal models of the same level k). another possibility is to construct more general
b
, than cardys. in particular, in the correspondence of d-brane boundary states in
gepner models and cy-compactications, the boundary conditions in (2.4) and (2.5) are
only necessary for the currents of the c = 9 conformal eld theory, not for the currents
associated with each minimal model factor in the tensor product. relaxing this condition
makes the theory non-rational and more general boundary states are possible 4. a general
solution to this problem seems rather dicult and we will not pursue this question further
in this paper (see however [22]).

3. covariant external part of the boundary state

the construction reviewed in the previous section is purely algebraic in terms of
n = 2 scft. however, the external part consists of usual free bosons and fermions. thus
one can split the boundary states into the internal and external parts and express the
external part by coherent-type boundary states.
in such an expression, the degrees of
freedom from the boson zero-modes become explicit.

in the following we will construct the external part of the boundary state in a covari-
ant formalism following [23]. in the light-cone gauge all longitudinal degrees of freedom
are expressed in terms of transverse ones. it is possible to formulate d-brane boundary
states in the light-cone gauge [24](see appendix b). there are however some aspects of the
boundary states which are best described in the covariant ramond-neveu-schwarz formal-
ism. in the covariant formalism, in addition to the bosonic and fermionic world sheet elds
and internal cft elds, there are anti-commuting b, c ghosts and commuting ,  ghosts.
the boundary conditions for the ghosts are determined by demanding brst invariance
of the boundary state. the main feature of the ghost dependent part is that it cancels

the contribution of two bosonic and fermionic oscillators in the annulus partition function,
leading to the same result as the light-cone boundary states. there are however subtleties
arising in the rr sector due to the choice of a picture for the superghosts, which will be
addressed later.

a d0-brane imposes neumann boundary conditions on x 0 and dirichlet boundary
conditions on x i, i = 1, 2, 3. the boundary conditions for the bosonic oscillators are given
by

(3.1)
 = diag(1, +1, +1, +1). the d0-brane will be localized in space at yi, i = 1, 2, 3.

the boundary state is then given by

(3.2)

with t0 a normalization constant. this is determined so that the boundary state repro-
duces the cylinder amplitudes from the coleman-weinberg formula [1]. for dp-branes in
d-dimensions, it is given by [25][23],

tp =



2(d10)/4 (42)(d2p4)/4 .

(3.3)

the d0-brane tension is then given by t0/ where 2 = 8gn with gn newtons constant.
the b, c part of the boundary state will not be important in the following and will
not be displayed here. in the nsns sector the world-sheet fermions are half integral modes
and the boundary condition on the fermions and ,  ghosts are given, e.g., by

with

(3.4)

(3.5)

here the subscript (1, 1) indicates that in the nsns sector the ghost number of the
vacuum is chosen to be (1, 1). the boundary state (2.6) are gso projected, which
means that the total u(1) charge of the left- as well as the right-moving sector is odd. the
boundary state (3.5) has neither even nor odd fermion number. there are two possible
combinations of denite fermion number,

| b, s0 = 0insns =

r + r r  r r)(cid:1) | 0i(1,1)

= i sin(cid:0)xr

(m 
r



r + r r  r r)(cid:1) | 0i(1,1)

.

(3.7)

here | b, s0 = 0insns has even fermion number and has to be tensored with a state with
odd internal u (1) charge. on the other hand | b, s0 = 2insns has odd fermion number
and has to be tensored with a state with even internal u (1) charge.

in the rr sector the implementation of the gso projection is more subtle. the
ground states in the rr sector are tensor products of spin elds. due to the superghost
number anomaly on the disk the boundary state is not dened in a left-right symmetric
picture but in the (3/2, 1/2) picture. there are two components labeled by s0 = 1
which have external u (1) charges. in analogy with the ten-dimensional case described in
[26] we can construct the rr part of the boundary state as a product

the gso projection implies that the boundary state | b, s0 = 1irr is tensored
with states in the internal sector | q, q i with q = 2m+1/2, m  z whereas | b, s0 = +1irr
is tensored with states in the internal sector | q, q i with q = 2m  1/2, m  z.

we can now calculate the external contribution to the cylinder amplitude. denoting
the contributions from the boson zero-modes and the boson and fermion oscillators by 0

4. open string partition function

a distinct advantage of knowing the exact conformal eld theory and the boundary
states is that the closed string cylinder amplitude has a dual interpretation as the open
string partition function. the two are related by world-sheet duality transformation which
mixes all the massless and the massive modes.

for a boundary conditions the cylinder amplitude for two boundary states imple-

menting the same boundary conditions  is given by

function z for two identical d-branes only depends on  = (l

it is easy to see that the open string spectrum of (4.3) is gso projected, i.e. the all the
states appearing in z(q) have odd integer u (1) charges. however the set of labels (, )
for elds entering in the open string partition function (4.3) is very dierent from the elds
entering the closed string boundary state (4.1), since all mi = v0 in (4.3) take the same

such operators can be determined considering z(q) = h  |  |  i instead of (4.1). for
boundary conditions ,  which are not mutually supersymmetric there will be an open
string tachyon in the spectrum. the massless open string modes for d0-branes in gepner
models correspond to primaries with q0 in the partition function.

as an example, we consider the quintic hypersurface which corresponds to the (k =
3)5 gepner model. there is a universal g,g , with labels s0 = 2, (li, mi, si) = (0, 0, 0)5.
this corresponds to the excitations 
1/2 | 0i,  = 0,    , 3. in spacetime these modes
correspond to the position of the d0-brane and a gauge eld a0 living on the world-line.
in (4.3) is only non-zero for lj = 0. it is then easy to see using
the formulas given in appendix a that the elds given above are the only massless elds
if there exits l
j = 0, 3. these elds and their fermionic partners are a d = 4 n = 1 vector
multiplet reduced to 0 + 1 dimensions. introducing u (n) chan-paton factors the resulting
quantum mechanics describing n d0-branes will be given by the dimensional reduction of
n = 1 u (n) super yang-mills to (0 + 1) dimensions.

j = 0, 3 the n

if all l

j = 1, 2 there are additional massless elds denoted by s0 = 0, (li, mi, si) =
(2, 4, 2)5 which by eld redenition is mapped into s0 = 0, (li, mi, si) = (1, 1, 0)5 and s0 =
0, (li, mi, si) = (2, 6, 2)5 which is mapped into s0 = 0, (li, mi, si) = (1, 1, 0)5. for the quintic
one can check that these two are the only massless states (together with their fermionic
partners) and they correspond to scalars (fermions) in the external sector. hence depending
on the gepner model and the boundary conditions  there are additional massless modes
which are given by the dimensional reduction of a chiral n = 1 multiplet to (0 + 1)
dimensions. for n d0-branes this multiplet would transform in the adjoint of u (n). in
principle the couplings of these elds are determined by calculating correlation functions
on the disk with  operators inserted on the boundary. the simplest such quantity
would be given by the three-point function of two fermionic open string states and one
bosonic one, which is connected to the superpotential of the chiral elds.

when there is more than one type of d0-brane present there can also be addi-
tional massless (and tachyonic) modes coming from open strings stretched between the
two branes. such open string states are given by boundary changing operators .

it is an interesting and open question whether the quantum mechanics of d0-branes
in compactied theories can be used to give a matrix theory denition of m-theory com-
pactied on cy [27]. in this context, d0-branes in type iia are relevant and they are
described by the b-type boundary states. in this case, the expression of the cylinder am-
plitude is slightly dierent from (4.3) [16]. then one nds that if all l
j = 1, 2 the characters
including massless states are the same in the closed and open channels, which is similar to
the ten-dimensional case.

5. coupling to closed string elds

boundary states for dp-branes can be eciently used [23] to calculate the coupling
(tadpoles) of massless closed string modes to the d-brane. such couplings were then
compared to the large distance behavior of elds around a black p-brane of supergravity
[28].

in the case of d0-branes in gepner model compactications the boundary state will

be used to read o the coupling to the gravitational eld and the vector multiplets.

the massless states in the nsns sector corresponding to the universal elds are of

the form

(5.1)

where the four-dimensional polarization tensor contains the graviton, nsns anti-symmetric
 = 1/2(  nk 
tensor and dilaton. the dilaton polarization tensor is given by 
nk) where the vector n satises nk = 1, n2 = 0. the coupling of the dilaton to the d0-
brane vanishes for d0-brane boundary conditions dened in (3.1) since 
m  = 0. this
result is expected since there is no direct coupling of the d0-brane to the hypermultiplet
moduli. the coupling of the anti-symmetric tensor also vanishes. using the traceless-ness
of the graviton the coupling of the graviton to the d0-brane boundary state is given by

h  | b i = m n b

g,g = 00n b

g,g .

(5.2)

here n = t0/(2), we have dened g by (li = 0) and g by (s0 = 2, mi = si = 0) and
in the last line the traceless-ness of the graviton wave function has been used.

the scalar elds in the vector multiplets are found in the nsns sector. each scalar
eld corresponds to a primary ,
,  with h = h = 1/2. for type iib, which we are
interested in, we have q = 1, q = 1 whereas for type iia we have q = 1, q = 1. we
, with q = 1, and by a
denote by a a particular scalar associated with a primary ,
a conjugate eld with primary ,
, and q = 1. the one-point function for the two
scalars is then given by

h , , ,  | b i = n b

h , , , | b i = n b

, = n b

(5.3)

where the last equality follows from the denition of b

, (2.7).

for the scalar eld a or the graviton with quantum numbers (, ), there is a vector
eld in the ramond sector associated with s0 = +1 and it has the quantum numbers
(,   0). then the charge conjugated component with s0 = 1 has quantum numbers
(,  + 0). because the rr boundary states (3.8) and (3.9) are in the (3/2, 1/2)
picture the relevant tadpoles use the vector vertex operators w  which are discussed in

9

appendix c. in particular, it turns out that only the components w 
boundary states. the relevant part of the boundary state (2.6) is given by

0 (a) couple to the

where the external part in the above is given by (3.8) or (3.9) depending on the value of
s0 = 1. as discussed in appendix c, the couplings of the boundary states to w 
0 (a) are
electric and magnetic, respectively. they are determined by using the explict forms of the
external boundary state (3.8) and (3.9) and the vertices w ,

alternatively for a given boundary condition  one might introduce a phase in the denition
of the vertex operators w 
0 and make the coupling to the boundary state purely electric
or magnetic. for dierent boundary conditions  the coupling will in general be dyonic5.

5 these results are obtained also by a simple argument in the light-cone gauge. in this case,
it is easy to calculate h a1  ia2 | b i . after an analytic continuation (see appendix b), these give

the couplings of a0  ia2. however, since the gauge elds are supposed to live on the world-line,

the eld strength coming from a2 should be interpreted as a magnetic dual of a eld strength,

namely, f

(a2) = f

coupling as in (5.6).

note that a connection between (li, mi, si) and the geometrical picture of the bound-
ary states has been discussed in [17]. in this sense, the ratio of the electric and magnetic
charges may be determined by geometrical data similarly to the orbifold limit case [7].

in ten dimensions d-brane charges automatically satisfy dirac-zwanziger quantiza-
tion conditions [1]. in the case of cy compactications there are nv + 1 dierent vector
elds and charges, and for two dierent boundary conditions  and  we denote the charges
by q and q respectively. the quantization condition should then read

hence we would like to interpret the boundary state as a d0-brane which carries
electric and magnetic charges qe, qm and has a following coupling to the world-line to the
lowest order in the bulk elds;

here the values for ci are determined by (5.3) and the charges qi are determined by (5.6).

6. supersymmetry and vanishing of cylinder amplitude

the bps nature of d0-branes dened by the boundary states (2.6) ensures that the
static force between two of them vanishes. this force can be calculated to lowest order in
string perturbation theory by the cylinder diagram.

in the limit of large separations only the exchange of massless closed string states is
important. the vanishing of the cylinder amplitude implies the bps cancelation between
the massless nsns and rr elds. we will see that this occurs in each multiplet.
in
the universal sector the cancelation between the graviton and the graviphoton exchange
determines the bps relation between the mass and the central charge. for the vector
multiplets the cancelation relates the scalar and the vector coupling.

the cancelation between the nsns and rr elds at every mass level follows from
two facts. firstly the contribution of a state to the cylinder amplitude is proportional to

c

nyj=1

sin2h

(lj + 1)(l
kj + 2

i. sinh

lj + 1

kj + 2i .

(6.1)

secondly, the supersymmetry ensures that for every state in the nsns sector there is an
rr state in the same mass level. the supersymmetry connecting the nsns and rr states

11

is essentially the spectral ow and shifts  in (6.1) by an odd number of 0. since 0 is
independent of , , the contributions from the nsns and rr states have just an opposite

sign,

,s0=1 = c
c

,s0=0,2 .

(6.2)

this gives the cancelation in each multiplet at each mass level.

alternatively, we can apply an argument in the light-cone gauge given by gepner in

[29]. the spacetime supersymmetry current can be bosonized dening (see appendix b

for details on the notation)

 =

(6.3)

the exponentials by  = ei and  = ei (omitting a cocycle factor) are free fermions.

the fact that all elds have odd u (1) charge implies that the fermion  is in the ramond

sector (this is not to be confused with the nsns and rr sector described above).

the supersymmetry charge is simply the zero-mode of these free complex fermions

q = 0, q = 
0. the c = 12 scft splits into a c = 1 free complex fermion and a
c = 11 cft, which is neutral under the u (1) charge. acting on a state with q will shift
   + 0.

similarly for the right-mover we have a free complex fermion  associated with the
supercharges q, q. in [17] it was shown that the boundary state preserves a supersym-
metry (q + i q) | b i = 0. this implies that the boundary state must be the product of
a c = 11 part times

| b ic=1  | i + i

0


0 | i ,

(6.4)



where | i is annihilated by 0 and 0. it is clear from (6.1) that a shift by 0 introduces
a minus sign for each pair 
0 inserted. hence the cylinder amplitude will vanish since
0
0 and 
h | i  h ++ | ++i = 1  1 = 0 with | ++i a state annihilated by 
0.
after modular transformation to the open string channel, the same argument basically
implies that the free fermion part of the partition function is give by tr(1)f ql0 = 0,
which vanishes because of the presence of fermionic zero modes for the free fermion q in

the odd spin structure. this is reminiscent of the gs formalism where the green-schwarz

fermions become world-sheet fermions in the light-cone gauge, and cancelations due to

supersymmetry are manifest in the odd spin structure.

7. velocity dependent cylinder amplitude

the boundary state formalism can be used to describe d-branes moving with a
constant velocity [30]. such boundary states are simply constructed by applying a boost
operator on the boundary states at zero velocity. hence the boosted boundary state is
dened by

where tanh v is the velocity and the boost operator k 01 = k 01

it is easy to see that as far as the cylinder amplitude is concerned the boost is just acting
as a twist on the bosonic and fermionic oscillators. after careful consideration of the zero-
mode part the changes in the cylinder amplitude can be separated into the bosonic and
fermionic part and we get

7.1. potential between two moving d0-branes

for non-zero v, the cylinder amplitude does not vanish and one obtains non-vanishing
potential between two moving d0-branes. the calculation is straightforward and, by the

the contributions from the massless closed string states are extracted using the
asymptotic forms of the characters as q = e2t  0. at low velocity, the leading contri-
butions are given by

(7.6)

herepc indicates the summation over the chiral primaries and includes the contributions

from nv vector multiplets whereas the rst term is the contribution from the gravity
multiplet. we see that the cancelation at v = 0 occurs in each multiplet.

we also see that the potential starts from v2 and hence the moduli space has a
non-trivial metric. this is as expected because the boundary states preserve only n = 1
spacetime supersymmetry. moreover, since theta functions i(iv/|it) can be expanded in
v by eisenstein functions, it is possible to get the exact coecients for vn terms.

7.2. absorptive part

at non-zero v, the cylinder amplitude a = (/2)r 

0 dt z(q) gets imaginary part
because 1
1 has simple poles in the open string channel. the imaginary part is interpreted
as indicating pair creation of open strings as discussed in the ten-dimensional case [31].
although the amplitudes in gepner models are more complicated, the argument here is
almost the same as in the ten-dimensional case since we know the modular transformation
between the closed and open string channels.

following the procedure in [31], the imaginary part is given by

with i(isv/|is) instead of i(iv/|it).
at low velocity v  1, the leading contribution comes from the massless open sting
states and it is vanishingly small for b2 > v as eb2/v. on the other hand, at high velocity
v  1, the dominant contribution comes from the graviton in the closed string channel
and the internal minimal model part does not matter. by a modular transformation of
(s), one nds

this shows the behavior of fundamental strings at high energy and black absorptive disks

8. comparison to black holes in n = 2 supergravity

d-branes in the ten-dimensional theory have corresponding black p-brane solutions in
supergravity [28]. they are regarded as dierent representations of the same bps objects.
since d-branes have boundary state description, it should be possible to relate them to
the black p-branes. in fact, a precise correspondence has been found in this case [23][24].
furthermore, a four-dimensional reissner-nordstrom black hole is obtained by wrapping
a d3-brane on a calabi-yau threefold and the connection to the corresponding boundary
state has been shown in the orbifold limit t 6/z3 [7]. in this section, we show that our
boundary states correspond to some extremal black holes in d = 4 n = 2 supergravity.

our boundary states couple to the bosonic sector of 1 gravity multiplet and nv = h2,1
vector multiplets, where h2,1 is a hodge number of the corresponding cy. note that there
are no couplings to the hypermultiplets (including the dilaton) and the anti-symmetric
tensor. the boundary states also satisfy the bps condition.

in d = 4 n = 2 supergravity, there exist the bps black hole solutions which have
the same couplings. to see this, let us rst recall the low energy action for the bosonic
part of the gravity and vector multiplets6

the bps solutions without non-trivial fermionic elds are obtained from the condition

(8.14)

 are dyonic and hence so are the physical elds ga

the electric components of the gauge elds are obtained from (8.2). we see that these black
holes have the same couplings to the massless elds as the boundary states. moreover, in a
generic case, f i
 . this is in agreement
with the dyonic gauge couplings discussed in section 5. without introducing an additional
phase in the denition of t 
 is real.
hence t is always magnetic. this is again consistent with the discussion in section 5; by
proper denition of the vertex operator, one can always make the graviphoton magnetic
as long as the mutually supersymmetric boundary states, which satisfy q = q  (mod 2),
are considered.

 , it follows from (8.5) and (8.11) that the charge of t 

one can nd more precise correspondence using the potential from the massless
particle exchange between two moving black holes. the coupling constant (charge) for the
graviton is given by the black hole mass m , which is read o from the asymptotic behavior
e2u + 1  2gn m/r. similarly, the charges for the complex scalars are obtained from
za  wa/r+constant. for the gauge elds, the electric and magnetic charges are obtained
 and ga
similarly to (8.8),(8.9) and we denote by u0 and ua the complex charges for t 
 ,
respectively. then the potential is given by [35]

v = 

1

2r(cid:16) m 2 cosh 2v  |u0| 2 cosh v +

nvxa=1

| wa| 2 

nvxa=1

|ua| 2 cosh v(cid:17) ,

(8.15)

where r is the distance between the two black holes and tanh v is the relative velocity. a
hatted quantity is equal to the corresponding un-hatted one up to a constant coming from
the proper normalization of the physical eld.

because of supersymmetry, there are constraints among charges. first, from the rst
equations of (8.5) and (8.11), one nds that m  u0. this is nothing but the bps mass
formula for n = 2 black holes [32][36]. furthermore, the second equations of (8.5) and
(8.11) give the relation wa  iua. consequently, the potential is brought into the form

v = 

1

2rh m 2(cosh 2v  cosh v) +

nvxi=1

|ua| 2(1  cosh v)i .

(8.16)

we nd that this is the same form as (7.6) from gepner models. the boundary state then
corresponds to the black hole with

m = u0 = |q0

e + iq0

m| ,

| wa| = |ua| = |qa
17

e + iqa

m| .

(8.17)

furthermore, one can make precise comparison also by using the tadpoles discussed
in section 5 [23]. the couplings between the boundary states and the massless states
are regarded as the sources for the massless elds. thus overlaps calculated in section 5
correspond to the charges of the massless elds on the supergravity side which are read o
from the asymptotic behavior of the elds as r  . however, the massless contribution to
the potential takes the form v  r1pi:masslessh b, v | iih i| b, 0i . hence the matching

of the potential implies the correspondence of the overlaps and the massless eld charges.
in fact, this is nothing but (8.17). the advantage of using tadpoles is that one can see the
tensor structure as in (5.2) and the dyonic couplings as in (5.5) [23][7]. (though we have
summed the components of the polarization tensor  in (5.2), it is possible to extract a
specic component, of course.)

in addition, the boundary states can be purely magnetic (or electric). in particular,
by the proper denition of the physical elds, we can always make a boundary state mag-
netic as long as only one boundary state is considered. it is easy to nd the corresponding
magnetic black hole solution on the supergravity side. it is given by the magnetic solution
discussed in [36][37], i.e., the solution with h 0 = na = 0. in this case, the metric and the
homogeneous coordinates are given by

1

x 0 =

2qdabch ah bh c/n0 ,
e2u = 2pn0dabc h ah bh c .

x a = 

i
2

h a ,

(8.18)

we then nd that the scalars za are purely imaginary and so are their charges wa. by
(8.5) and (8.11), this means that ua are real and hence ga

 are magnetic.

9. scattering involving open string states

string scattering amplitudes on the disk with d0-brane boundary conditions give the
lowest order contributions to scattering processes involving the d0-brane. such amplitudes
are given by inserting n boundary operators (open string vertices) 
, on the boundary
of the disk and m closed string vertices ,

,  in the interior of the disk.

in general the boundary states which dene the boundary cft are determined in
terms of the quantities ba
i , where the label i runs over all the chiral primary elds of the
bulk cft. the ba
i are determined via the one-point functions of primary elds i,(i) on
the disk where h i,(i) | i = b
i . here  denotes the gluing automorphism [16] which
determines which elds can couple consistently to the boundary. the primary elds in the
bulk live in h  h. the so called doubling trick turns the anti-holomorphic eld living
on the upper half plane into a holomorphic eld on the lower half plane,

i (i+)(z) ,

(i)(z)  r
18

(9.1)

where i+ denotes the conjugate eld which is determined by the chiral ope i(z)i+ (0) =
z2h1 +   . the reection coecients r
i can be determined through the connection of
the bulk to boundary operator product
i,i(z, z) =xk

i k(x) .

the ope coecient for the identity operator c 0
can be related to the insertion of
i,(i) on the disk. the calculation of this quantity using the boundary states determines
c 0

conditon labeled by  is given by

i = b

(9.3)

as an example we will consider the two-point function of two massless closed string

elds given by

h vi(j)eik1x (z1)vk(l)eik2x (z2)ih = |z1  z2|k1k2|z1  z2|k1m k2

 |z1  z1|k1m k1|z2  z2|k2m k2 r

j r

l h i(z1)j+( z1)k(z2)l+(z2)is ,

(9.4)

where m is the matrix in (3.1), and h  is denotes the correlation function for the chiral
elds on the plane. after xing the conformal killing symmetry and integrating over
the position of the vertex operators we have a very similar result to [39]. the detailed
properties of the amplitude are hidden in the four-point function of the gepner model
elds. correlators of n = 2 minimal models can be expressed in terms of free bosonic and
parafermionic corrrelators [40][41]. the amplitude will display an innite set of s-channel
poles in the region where z1  z2, and the bulk ope

i(z, z)j(0) xk

zhkhihj zhkhihj ck

ijk

(9.5)

will determine the couplings. on the other hand for the t-channel poles (when one vertex
operator approaches the boundary) the bulk to boundary ope (9.2) determines the cou-
plings. the fact that these two-point functions have an innite set of poles in the open
string channel indicates that the d0-branes has many internal excitations determined by
open string spectrum, which is not surprising for a black hole.

correlation functions with only boundary eld (open string vertex operators) inserted
can be used to calculate terms appearing in the eective quantum mechanics governing
the open strings stretched between branes.

it would be interesting to determine whether in some cases the massless states in
the open string spectrum found in section 4 correspond to exactly marginal boundary
perturbations [42]. a condensate of such operators would provide a continuous deformation
of the boundary state and correspond to a modulus associated with the wrapped brane.

10. conclusions

in this paper we have used the d-brane boundary states constructed in gepner mod-
els to analyze some aspects of the dynamics of d0-branes in calabi-yau compactications
of type ii theories to four dimensions. the advantage of working with an exactly soluble
conformal eld theory lies in the fact that the spectrum and in principle all the correla-
tion functions are exactly known. in particular this implies that the relation between the
cylinder and annulus allows to nd the spectrum of stretched open strings, which is not
possible if one only knows the massless part of the boundary state.

we have found a correspondence between the d0-brane boundary states and a class
of d = 4 n = 2 black holes. they are both the bps objects for the same n = 2
supersymmetry. it would be interesting to nd more precise correspondence between the
d0-branes and the black holes, e.g., the matching of the black hole entropy and the hawking
radiation. gepner models and the cy compactication models are at dierent points of
the moduli space and the classical black holes have macroscopic charges. thus the issues
of the moduli and quantum corrections might be important to further investigations.

note that the boundary states (2.6) carries the minimal amount of charge because it
satises the cardys constraint with minimal multiplicities for the open string characters.
we can in principle multiply the boundary state by an integer factor. this corresponds to
introducing n chan paton factors. a disk diagram with no open string vertices inserted
simply picks up a trace which is equal to n . note that by looking at a single boundary
state, we are restricted to a regime where n is nite and g is small. in the ten-dimensional
case, the dp-branes are constructed in at minkowski space, but represent curved black
p-branes of supergravity. the d-branes in the gepner model are constructed using the
asymptotic vacuum dened by a gepner model compactication without any d-branes.
on the other hand we have seen that the bps-character and the charges that they carry
makes it possible to identify d0-branes with extremal black holes in n = 2 supergravity.
the extreme n = 2 black holes have ads2  s2 near-horizon geometries and exhibit
the attractor mechanism [43]. considering a spherical world-sheet with large number of
disks cut out, i.e. a large number of boundary states on the disk, corresponds to a planar
large n limit.
in this limit the insertions of boundary states should be equivalent to
a new string theory on a world-sheet with no boundaries but living in the near-horizon
geometry where the internal calabi-yau manifold is determined by the xed point moduli
of the attractor equations. it would be very interesting to explore whether it is possible
to connect the attractor equations with a ow in the cft induced by the insertion of
boundaries.

appendix a. gepner models

in this appendix we will give a brief review of some aspects of gepner models. gepner
models [8] are exactly soluble supersymmetric compactications of type ii and heterotic
strings which use tensor products of n = 2 minimal models to construct the internal
scft. the n = 2 minimal models are unitary representations of the n = 2 scft which
are labeled by an integer k = 1, 2,   , where the central charge is given by

c =

3k

k + 2

.

(a.1)

primary elds l

m,s are labeled by three integers l, m, s with the ranges7

l = 0, 1,    , k, m = (k + 1),    , k + 2,

s = 0, 2, 1 ,

(a.2)

together with constraint l + m + s  2z. the eld identications (l, m, s)  (l, m, s + 4)
and (l, m, s)  (l, m + 2(k + 2), s) imply that m is dened modulo 2(k + 2) and s is dened
modulo 4. the labels (l, m, s) can be brought into the standard range by another eld
identication (l, m, s)  (k  l, m + k + 2, s + 2). the conformal dimension h and u (1)

a gepner model is constructed by tensoring n minimal models with ki, i = 1,    , n such
that the sum of the central charges of the n minimal models is equal to

= cint .

(a.4)

7 note that states with s = 2 are really descendants. nevertheless splitting each module into

subsets with s = 0 and s = 2 is a very useful bookkeeping device.

21

the total currents t, g, j of the tensor product are given by the sum of the currents of
each minimal model. for cint = 9, the external theory is given by one complex boson and
a level one so(2) current algebra. the primary elds can be labeled by two vectors

 = (l1,    , ln),  = (s0; m1,    , mn; s1,    , sn) .

(a.5)

here s0 = 0, 2, +1, 1 labels the four characters corresponding to o, v, s, c conjugancy
classes of the so(2) current algebra. gepner constructed a supersymmetric partition

function for the tensor product by using -projections (generalizing the gso projection)

and adding twisted sectors to achieve modular invariance. this -method uses the (2n +
1)-dimensional vectors: 0 which has 1 everywhere and i, i = 1,    , n which has 2 in the
rst and n + 1 + j entry and is zero everywhere else. an inner product of two (2n + 1)-

dimensional vectors is dened by

(a.6)

note that with the help of this inner product the total u (1) charge of a primary eld
is given by q = 20  . the gso projection is then implemented by projecting onto
in order to preserve the n = 1 superconformal
states with an odd integer charge q.
invariance all elds in the tensor product have to be in the same sector (r or ns). this
can be achieved by projecting onto states which satisfy j    z for j = 1,    n. gepner
constructed a modular invariant partition function by including twisted sectors,

 are the
characters corresponding to the primaries 
. the contribution from the external boson
oscillators is included in s0 in 
. in (a.7) the diagonal ane su (2) invariant is used
which exists for all levels kj. other choices according to the ade classication of ane

su (2) invariants are possible and lead to dierent models [45]. the notationp indicates
the summation over the -projected range (, ) and the (1)b0 imposes the connection
between spin and statistics. note that the supersymmetries have a very simple action on
the characters 
; acting with q corresponds to   +0 and acting with q corresponds
to     0.

appendix b. boundary states in the light-cone gauge

in [24], a construction of d-brane boundary states in the light-cone gauge was given.
a peculiar feature of these states is that they describe (p + 1) d-instantons instead of
dp-branes since the light-cone coordinates x  satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions. one
can use these boundary states simply as a calculational tool since they are related to the
dp-brane boundary states by an analytic continuation (double wick rotation). in fact,
the calculation of cylinder amplitudes is much easier in this gauge.

a dp-brane boundary condition is then given by

(x i  x i)| bpix = 0 ,

(b.1)
where i = 1, 2, and plus sign for i = 1, ..., 1+p and minus sign for i = 2+p, .., 2 (p = 1, 0).
the complex combinations of these free bosons and fermions form the simplest example of
a c = 3 n = 2 scft. except for the rr zero-mode part, the boundary state is obtained
by removing the ghost and light-cone oscillator parts of the corresponding boundary state
in the covariant case.

(i  i i)| bp,  i = 0 ,

the construction of the rr zero-mode part is similar to the ten-dimensional case
rr satisfying (b.1) for the zero-modes with p = 1 and
0. then

[46]. we start from a state | b1, +i0
 = +1. it is useful to dene i

(b.2)

the gso projection enforces that the left and right u (1) charges take odd integer
values. this relates the boundary conditions of the external and internal parts. using free
bosons, the left u (1) current is expressed by jtot = jext + jint = i + i3h whereas
the right u (1) current is

jtot = i   + i3  h ,

iib :

(b.3)
the dierence between iib and iia is the reversal of the sign of  (or equivalently the sign
of h). this can be traced back to the fact that iib in ten dimensions is chiral whereas
iia is not. because of (b.3), the external chirality operators are given by

iia :

jtot = i   + i3  h .

 = 3(1)f ,

 = 3(1)

f ,

(b.4)

with  = +1 for type iib and 1 for type iia.
in a-type boundary states, s0 takes the same sign in the left and right sectors whereas
it takes the opposite sigh in b-type boundary states. thus the gso projected states are
given by

| bp, s0 = 1i =

(1 + s0)(1  s0 )| bp, +irr ,

(b.5)

22

where +() for a(b)-type boundary states. one then nds that the projected states are
non-vanishing only when (i) for type iib, p = 0 for a-type and p = 1 for b-type, (ii) for
type iia, p = 1 for a-type and p = 0 for b-type. this is in agreement with the possible
combinations of the internal and external boundary conditions discussed in [17]. this is
also an analog of the ten-dimensional case in which the rr boundary states exist only for
odd p for type iib and even p for type iia because of the gso projection.

appendix c. vertex operators in the rr sector

the vertex operators for left- or right-moving ramond states contain three parts
(we only display the left-moving part, the right-moving elds will be barred): a bosonized
superghost part, an so(3, 1) spin eld and a ramond eld in the internal cft,

vs = exp(s) savqint .

(c.1)

here s denotes the superghost picture and qint denotes the internal u (1) charge. for the
spin eld sa we introduce a weyl notation where sa is a spinor of positive helicity and
s a is a spinor of negative helicity. in the s = 1/2 picture the gso projected vertices are
given by

v a = e

this is because the gso projection projects onto odd u (1) charge where the u (1) charge
is given by qgso = s + h + qint with h = 1 for un-dotted and h = 0 for dotted spinors.

we will consider iib strings compactied on a cy in the following. the standard
vertex operators for the rr elds are given by tensor products of left- and right-moving
rr elds in the 1/2 picture. these vertices contain the eld strength of the appropriate
rr potential. this implies that for iib the rr vector elds in the vector multiplet are
given by

v (f ) = e

here f + and f  are the self-dual and antiself-dual part of the eld strength, which satisfy
f  = 1
2 (f  i  f ) and f  = if . for the vector multiplets in type iib, the f + part
of the vertex (c.4) contains an rr eld vq=1/2,q=1/2 related to the (a,a) ring by spectral
ow, whereas the f  part of the vertex (c.4) contains an rr eld vq=1/2,q=1/2 related
to the (c,c) ring by spectral ow. these vertices correspond to the s0 = 1 states in the
light-cone gauge respectively. for the graviphoton vertex the internal part is replaced by
vq=3/2,q=3/2 and vq=3/2,q=3/2 respectively which are related to the identity by spectral
ow. because of the superghost anomaly of the disk, the rr states which couple to d-
branes are not the ones described above but are in an asymmetric picture. this fact makes
it possible that d-branes couple minimally to the appropriate rr-elds [11][1].

the vertex operator in the (3/2, 1/2) picture is given by

the sign will later be seen to correspond to an electric or magnetic vertex. the picture
changing operator mapping vs  vs+1 is dened by

vs+1(w) = {qbrst , vs(w)} ,

(c.6)

where the brst charge is qbrst = q0 + q1 + q2 and the three distinct contributions to
the charge are given by

q0 =i dz c(cid:0)text + tint + tgh(cid:1), q1 =

1

2i dz e(cid:0)x + gint(cid:1) ,

(c.7)

q2 =

eg(z)vs(w) ,

on the vertex operators of the form (c.5) (i.e., s = 3/2), the picture changing operation
eectively reduces to
(c.8)
where g = x + gint and gint is the internal n = 1 supercurrent dened by
g = g+ + g in terms of the two n = 2 superconformal currents. a simple obser-
vation which will be very important in the following is that since vq=1/2,q=1/2 dene
ramond/ramond ground states in the internal cft and vq=3/2,q=3/2 are the inter-
nal parts of the spacetime supercharges, we have the ope g(z)vq,q(w) which is at most
o((z w)1/2). this implies that in the picture changing operation only the external part
of (c.6) will be important. picture changing the vertex (c.5) gives

if we dene the vertex w +

to derive (c.9) we have further to impose the lorentz gauge condition ka = 0 on the
gauge potential. note that for the picture changed vertex operator the choice of sign in
(c.5) implies that the picture changed vertex w +
0 turns into v (f ) with da = f whereas
w 
0 (ae) with electric
0
variables, then the vertex w 

turns into iv (f ) with da = f .
note that the vertex (c.5) in the asymmetric picture is not brst invariant as it
stands. due to the comment regarding the action of gint above, the resolution of this
fact is exactly along the lines of the ten-dimensional case discussed in [26]. the basic
idea of [26] is that w0 fails to be brst invariant because of q1. a new vertex is then
n=0 w (n) such that [q1, w n] + [ q1, w n+1] = 0 for n = 0, 1,   , and
hence [q1 + q1, w ] = 0. for this to work one has to impose the lorentz gauge condition
ka = 0. note that under picture changing all the w (n) with n > 0 vanish.

dened as w = p

0 (am) corresponds to the magnetic dual variables.
