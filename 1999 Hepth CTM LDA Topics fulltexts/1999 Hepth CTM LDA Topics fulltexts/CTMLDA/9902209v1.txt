abstract

we study n = 1 supersymmetric su(nc) yang-mills theory on the lattice at

strong coupling and large nc. our method is based on the hopping parameter

expansion in terms of random walks, resummed for any value of the wilson

parameter r in the small hopping parameter region. results are given for the

mesonic (2-gluino) and fermionic (3-gluino) propagators and spectrum.

1 introduction

the non-perturbative aspects of the strongly interacting supersymmetric

(susy) gauge theories were intensely investigated in the past [1] and re-

cently they have been the object of renewed interest [2, 3]. these theories are

interesting from a phenomenological point of view as their non-perturbative

properties might play a crucial role in the understanding of the susy break-

ing mechanism [1]. however, besides the relevant phenomenological implica-

tions, the susy gauge theories have intrinsic importance as their very nature

allows the calculation of some exact non-perturbative solutions [2, 3].

in this paper we concentrate our attention on the most simple susy

gauge theory: the pure n = 1 susy yang-mills (sym) with su(nc) gauge

group. this contains the purely gluonic action, plus one avour of majorana

fermions in the adjoint representation of the colour group.

it is believed

that this theory is characterized by the same non-perturbative phenomena

as qcd: colour connement and chiral symmetry breaking [4]. nevertheless,

noticeable dierences between the sym theory and qcd appear to exist

even at the fundamental level. due to supersymmetry there is indeed a new

anomalous susy current which belongs to the same supermultiplet together

with the anomalous chiral and energy-momentum tensor currents [2].

the fundamental question of the breaking of the supersymmetry in n = 1

sym theory was addressed in [4, 5]. according to the general argument

of the witten index [5] or the veneziano-yankielowicz low energy eective

theory [4], the supersymmetry does not break. however, here the chiral

symmetry breaks and the gluino condensate acquires a vacuum expectation

value [4, 6].

from [4, 6] we learn that the low energy supermultiplet contains three

2

degenerate massive colourless bound states: a scalar, a pseudoscalar and a

fermion eld (where the appearance of the fermion eld in the low-energy

supermultiplet is a consequence of the colour adjoint representation for the

gluino). moreover, there is no pseudo-goldstone boson (or pion) associated

with the chiral symmetry breaking, as the latter is broken by the anomaly.

some time ago curci and veneziano [7] suggested that the sym theories

can be studied non-perturbatively on the lattice by using numerical monte

carlo simulations. this is clearly analogous to the approach used in qcd

theory. they argued [7] that, even if the lattice breaks explicitly supersym-

metry, it is possible to recover the susy and chiral ward identities on the

continuum limit.

recently two dierent collaborations [8]-[11] studied non-perturbatively

on the lattice the spectrum of the sym (n = 1) theory following the guide-

lines suggested in [7]. in [10], because of the limitations deriving from the

use of computing resources, the quenched approximation was used to study

the spectrum. this approximation consists in neglecting the internal gluino

loops. in other words, in the correlation functions of fermion composite op-

erators, the fermion determinant is not included. in sym theories, if general

arguments are taken into account [4], the quenched approximation cannot

be justied on the basis of large nc dominance, since gluinos are in the ad-

joint representation of the colour group. however, in [10] it is observed that,

within the statistical errors of the monte carlo simulation, the spectrum

seems to show no deviations from the supersymmetry expectations under

the approximations considered there. in connection with this result, in [12],

by means of an eective lagrangian approach, the splitting in the low energy

supermultiplet induced by the quenched approximation has been analysed,

and it is argued that the splittings from the supersymmetry predictions are

3

small.

in any case, in [9, 11] unquenched results for an su(2) sym gauge theory

were obtained by using numerical simulations with dynamical gluinos. it is

likely that new results in this eld will quickly follow.

in this paper we study the spectrum of the sym (n = 1) on the lattice

at strong coupling and in the large nc limit. the lattice strong coupling ex-

pansion technique (see [13] and references therein) has been extensively used

as an analytical probe to test qualitative properties both of the continuum

and of the lattice theory by itself. up to now, however, the main part of

the results refers to qcd, and to our knowledge no work deals with a su-

persymmetrized version of it. in detailed computations the strong coupling

expansion of su(nc) theories is frequently combined with the large nc one.

our reference comes from works in which issues such as the phase struc-

ture of qcd or the computation of meson and baryon masses are addressed

[14]-[19]. the most frequent computational frameworks split into two types:

 eective actions: the wilson-dirac lattice action is considered at large
nc and small . the large nc expansion can be recognized as a saddle-

point expansion of the gauge functional integral, previously simplied
by the   0 limit[14]-[16]. the method allows the study of the large
and small hopping parameter regions at the expense of introducing

assumptions on the form of the saddle points. the main disadvantage

of this method for our purposes is that the one matrix integration

formulae, a basic ingredient of the construction, are not available for

matrices in the adjoint representation, and the generalization does not

seem straightforward.

 path resummation: the fermion matrix m is inverted by using the

4

standard hopping parameter expansion [13, 15, 19]. this allows to

compute propagators m1 in terms of sums over paths on the lattice

(random walks); the objects to be summed are traces of products of
spin matrices (ri ), r being the wilson parameter. we will see that
provided the hopping parameter  is small enough and some constraints

on the parameters are imposed, no assumptions are required to perform
this computation in the nc  ,   0 limit. however, up to now this
analysis has been realized only for the case r = 1, where the structure

of the series is considerably simplied [15]. in ref. [20] the formulas of

path resummation are generalized to any value of r.

in our case, it will be shown that the hopping parameter expansion in

terms of random walks is valid, with slight changes, for the case of gauge

elds in the adjoint representation. thus, using the formulas of ref. [20] we

will be able to give expressions for propagators and masses for any value of

r and small enough . we considered that keeping r arbitrary could be very

important. this allows the possibility of searching for multicritical points,

where several lattice masses vanish. in particular, we investigated whether
one could nd a critical point in the   r plane where the massless modes
would form a supermultiplet. this would signal a possible candidate for a

supersymmetric continuum limit, in the spirit of the chiral restoration of or-

dinary qcd. for example, if a low energy theory of the type described in [7]

would take place, one would nd a massless pseudoscalar meson, together

with a scalar meson and a fermion. we should warn the reader that by

massless we refer to the vanishing of the lattice masses, not necessarily the

renormalized physical masses. however, in our approximations the diagrams

contributing to the anomaly, and giving mass to the pseudoscalar, are sub-

leading, indicating that the physical masses are also zero, as predicted for a

5

goldstone boson associated to the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry.

in addition to the path resummation formulae, we also need to analyse

the behaviour in the large nc limit of integrals over the group of products

of matrices in the adjoint representation. these are studied in [22]. in this

paper we will only need to know the order in nc of certain integrals. given

this, the actual leading order results are very simple.

to increase the usefulness of our paper, many of our formulas will be

given for arbitrary space-time dimensionality d. in addition, we will indicate

the necessary changes to make the formulae valid for matter elds in the

fundamental representation and for dirac, rather than majorana, fermions.

specic attention will be paid, however, to the supersymmetric cases of d =

3, 4.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we present the formalism

and general formulae for the expectation values and correlation functions

of two and three gluino operators in the strong coupling large nc limit. in

section 3 we analyse the specic channels and present the results for the

spectrum in the meson and fermion sector. finally in section 4 we summarize

our conclusions, discuss the physical implications and explain the prospects

for possible future extensions of our results. the paper is completed by

collecting in the appendix the terminology and formulae on lattice paths

that we will use along the text.

2 general formalism

we begin by xing our notation and terminology. let us consider a d-
dimensional hypercubic lattice l  z d. we introduce an index set i having
2d elements. to any direction in space-time we associate two indices  and 

6

corresponding to the two opposite senses (forward and backward) associated
to each direction . given an element   i, the element  labels the one
with reverse orientation ( = ). to any element   i, we can associate a
vector v() as follows:

v() = e

v() = e ,

(1)

with e the unit vector in the  direction (the lattice spacing is set to 1). in

the appendix we give some additional results and terminology that we will

be using in the following sections.

let us now write down the lattice version of the susy yang-mills action:

s = sg +

1
2

ijmij

,

(2)

where sg is the pure gauge part and i is a grassman variable representing

the eld of a majorana fermion. the index i is a short form for the three

indices n, a and a. the index n species a point in the d-dimensional
hypercubic lattice l. the index a takes n 2
c  1 values corresponding to the
dimension of the lie algebra of su(nc). the index a is a spinorial index
taking 2[d/2] values (the symbol [x] stands for integer part of x). without

much problem, but at the expense of breaking supersymmetry, we could add

a avour index ranging over a nite number of values. the matrix m must

be antisymmetric and its form is given by

m = c m

m =(cid:0)i pi (cid:1) ,

(3)

(4)

where i is the unit matrix and cab is the charge conjugation matrix, satis-

fying:

t
 c = c 
c t = c ,

7

(5)

(6)

where the superscript t stands for transpose.

finally the matrix  is given by:

()ij =  m n+v() u ab

 (n) (ri  )ab ,

(7)

with i = (n, a, a), j = (m, b, b);  is the hopping parameter, and r is the

wilson parameter. for  = , u(n) is the gauge eld link variable (which

is in the adjoint representation) and  the dirac matrix, while for  =  we
have u(n) = u t

(n  e) and  = . notice that we have:

 = 2(r2  1) i .

(8)

it is easy to show that given the conditions eqs. (5)-(6), the matrix m is

indeed antisymmetric.

customarily, the value of r is taken in the interval [0, 1]. this follows from

the requirement of osterwalder-schrader positivity. however, at strong cou-

pling this is not a necessary condition for the physical correlation functions

to admit an analytical continuation to unitary minkowski green functions.

for that reason we will be working for arbitrary r and comment at the rel-

evant places whether the p-gluino correlation functions satisfy the positivity

conditions.

the constraint imposed by the existence of the matrix c, together with

the needed matching of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom, makes

the naive continuum limit of the above lagrangian supersymmetric (n =

1) in d = 3, 4. the same lagrangian is supersymmetric in d = 10 if 

is a majorana-weyl eld, and in d = 6 if  is a weyl spinor. however,

the requirement of weyl character conicts with the well-known absence of

chirality on the lattice, which prevents us from directly writing a lattice

version of the required lagrangian (indeed, our wilson-type action breaks

8

chirality explicitly). on the other hand, the general argument by curci and

veneziano [7] linking the recovery of chirality and supersymmetry could play

a role in the interpretation of these cases, as of course does in the (more

transparent) d = 3, 4 as well.

having in mind this caveats regarding the interpretation of the results, in

the rest of our exposition we will try to work as much as possible in arbitrary

dimension d without specifying more. this has the advantage that it allows

our formulae to be used with little changes by other researchers with other

physical interests. for example, links can be established with the technique

of 1/d expansions [21].

we will concentrate upon gauge invariant operators of the form:

oi(x) = a1

a1(x) . . . ap

ca1...ap
is an invariant colour tensor and sa1...ap

ap(x) sa1...ap

i

i

,

(9)

where ca1...ap
index i labels dierent possibilities for the denition. the restriction to

a spin tensor. the

i

i

operators obtained by multiplying gluino elds at the same lattice point (ul-

tralocal operators) will not aect our spectrum results which will be general.

in particular, this aects the composite fermion operator which belongs to

the same supermultiplet as the scalar and pseudoscalar:

a(x) =

1
2

()abf a

(x)a

b(x) ,

(10)

where in this formula the fermion elds  ,  and the yang-mills eld f
live in the continuum spacetime, and  = 1
2[, ]. later on, we will
argue that its corresponding minimal mass will be contained within the set

of masses corresponding to 3-gluino operators.

note that the operators in eq. 9 are non-vanishing only when the gluino

elds are combined in a completely antisymmetric way. by putting this

9

together with the requirement of ci being an invariant tensor, we arrive at
certain constraints on the possible operators; for example, in the case of
meson-like operators (p = 2) it turns out that, necessarily, ci = i and si is
an antisymmetric matrix. as an example, table 1 displays a complete basis

of 2-gluino operators in d = 4.

in this paper we will be interested in computing the expectation values

of these operators and products of these operators:

1

hoi(x)i =

gij(x  y)  hoi(x)oj(y)i =

 z d(n)y z du(n)! oi(x) es

z ynl
z ynl z d(n)y z du(n)! oi(x) oj(y) es (12)

(11)

1

at strong coupling. we will be able to accomplish this goal for  = 0, and in
the large nc limit. corrections to the formulae in powers of  and 1
nc

are in

principle feasible and will be considered elsewhere.

as usual, one can explicitly integrate out the fermions in eq. (11)-(12).

the main formula that one uses is:

yi (cid:18)z di(cid:19) exp{

1
2

ij mij+jii} = p f (m) exp{

1
2

jijj(m1c1)ij} ,
(13)

where p f (m) stands for the pfaan of the matrix m. the square of the

pfaan is the determinant, so that up to a sign we can write:

p f (m) =pdet(c) det(m) = exp{

1
2

t r(log(m))} ,

(14)

where we have used the standard exponential representation of a determinant,

and the fact that we can choose pdet(c) = 1. concerning the sign, it is

clear that what matters is the relative sign for dierent values of the gauge

10

eld conguration. however, for very small , the matrix m is close to the
unit matrix and our representation (eq. (14)) is valid. problems can only
arise when one of the eigenvalues of m crosses zero. using the schwartz
inequality and our expression for m, one can conclude that this problem
never occurs provided || <

2d (|r|+1).

1

what we will do now is to expand the quantities entering in eq. (13) as

a sum of paths. using the terminology of the appendix, we obtain:

p f (m) = exp{ 1

(m1(x, y))ab

ab =ps(xy) w ab() ab()

1

2pxlpl=1psl(xx)

l t r(w ()) t r(())} , (16)

where x, y are lattice points, w () is the path ordered product (along the

path ) of the gauge eld link variables, and () denotes the appropriate

product of the spin matrices:

(15)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(  (x, ~)) = l(r  1)    (r  l) .

let us rst consider 2-body operators:

oi(x) = sab

i a

a(x) a

b(x) = (x)bsi(x)

with bsi = c1si .

the second expression in (18) has the same form as for dirac fermions, the

dierence being that for majoranas we have the relation  = tc. notice
that si is an antisymmetric matrix. using the formula (13) and expanding
by using wicks theorem we obtain:

hoi(x)i = 

1

hp f (m)ight r(cid:0)m1(x, x) c1 si(cid:1) p f (m)ig

(20)

11

gij(x  y) =

1

hp f (m)ighp f (m) 
[2 t r(cid:0)c1 sim1(x, y) c1 sjm1(y, x)(cid:1)
+t r(cid:0)m1(x, x) c1 si(cid:1) t r(cid:0)m1(y, y) c1 sj(cid:1)]ig ,

(21)

where t r denotes the trace over colour and spin indices and the symbol
h ig denotes expectation value with respect to the pure gauge action part.
the rst term on the right hand side of eq. (21) represents the so-called

ozi contribution, while the second term contains the disconnected and non-

ozi contributions [7]. now using the formulae (15)-(16) we can write back

expressions (20)-(21) in terms of products of sums of paths.

up to now the expressions have been completely general, but now we
will consider the simplication arising from considering  = 0 and nc  .
what we need to know is the expectation value of the product of traces of

wilson loops in this limit. the main result that we will use [22] is that for
a collection of closed paths {1, . . . , s} which are not pure spikes (see the
appendix) we have:

h t r(w (1)) . . . t r(w (s))ig = o(1) .

(22)

ever, for a pure spike path w () = i, and therefore its trace is n 2

this is true both for connected and disconnected expectation values. how-
c  1. we
see that the connected correlation between a pure spike wilson loop and any

other operator vanishes. our rst conclusion is then that, at leading order

in nc, the factor p f (m) cancels between numerator and denominator. this

is precisely the quenched approximation, which turns out to be exact in this

limit. in principle, the result is surprising since fermions carry indices taking
n 2
c  1 values (as gluons), and the usual arguments why fermion loops are
subleading in the fundamental representation do not apply here. this adds

12

to the results obtained by other methods [10, 12], pointing towards the fact

that the deviations introduced by the quenched approximation are not too

large.

other conclusion that follows from formula (22) is the suppression in the

large nc limit of the non-ozi contributions to the connected correlation func-

tions. this includes the mass induced by the anomaly on the pseudoscalar

goldstone boson. we should, hence, expect such a massless state signalling

the recovery of chiral symmetry and its spontaneous breaking.

our results have been obtained at  = 0. however, one can introduce the

pure gauge action in various ways having the same naive continuum limit. if

one chooses to write the wilson action in the adjoint representation of the

group, formula (22) implies that to the order we are working (and in the

small  region) there are no corrections to any order in . this is not the

case if the customary fundamental representation wilson action is chosen.

the conclusion of the previous paragraphs is that to leading order in nc

all that we have to take into account are closed loops which are pure spikes.

for that purpose the results of ref.[20] and collected in the appendix are

needed. notice that for a pure spike path of length l, the spinor matrix is

given by:

() = (2(r2  1))l/2 i .

thus, using the formulae given in the appendix we can conclude:

(23)

(24)

(25)

hoi(x)i = (n 2
c  1) f (0, 2(r2  1)) t r(c1 si) =

13

this is the contribution of closed paths which are pure spikes. the corrections

coming from other paths are order 1, and thus subleading. the previous

formulae are obtained by resummation of a series. the radius of convergence

is given by the closest singularity. thus the formulae are strictly speaking
only valid in the region |2(r21)| < 1
4(2d1) . it is possible that, by analytical
continuation, the formulae could be valid in some points beyond this region,
such as for larger negative 2(r2  1).

expression (24) is also valid for dirac fermions.

it is also valid if the

elds (dirac or majorana) transform in the fundamental representation of
c  1) is replaced by nc, the dimension of the

the colour group, provided (n 2

representation in question.

now we look at the correlation function of two-fermion operators. in this
case we have two factors of m and hence we have an expansion in terms of
paths  going from x to y, and paths  going from y to x. nevertheless,

the integration over the gauge group forces the combined path to be a pure

spike path. to take this into account we proceed as follows. we replace the

summation over paths by a summation over paths with no spikes, resumming

all paths which have such a path as reduced path. thus, each term in the

new expansion corresponds to a reduced path  going from x to y, and

another one  that returns to x. however, now the condition imposed by
the integration over the gauge group is simply that  is the reverse path of 
(which we label 1). in this way the double summation reduces to a single

summation. summing up all that we have just expressed in words, we can

give the following formula for the connected correlation function:

g(conn.)

ij

(x  y) =  dr

xl=0 x sl(xy)
t r(cid:16)bsi()bsj (1)(cid:17) .

14

(f (l, 2(r2  1)))2 

(26)

the previous formula has been written in a way which makes it valid for

majorana ( = 2) or dirac ( = 1) fermions. the symbol dr stands for the
dimension of the gauge group representation (n 2
c  1 for the adjoint and nc
for the fundamental). now we can use the expression for f (l, 2(r2  1))
and the formulae for resumming over paths that are given in the appendix,

to conclude:

(32)

with this interpretation, formula (27) is valid for dirac fermions as well. we

will leave to the next section the evaluation of this expression and the study

of the properties of the resulting propagator.

15

we now turn our attention to 3-gluino fermion operators of the form:

oi(x) = a1

.

(33)

in this case there are two possible invariant colour tensors: dabc and fabc.

the main result that we will need on the group integration at large nc is the

following: given three paths without spikes 1, 2 and 3, we have:

cabc cabc

(2)w cc

(3)ig = n 3

c (1 = 2 = 3)

+subleading terms ,

(34)

where cabc is either f or d ( the antisymmetric and symmetric su(nc) invari-
ant tensors). the mixed terms f  d are subleading in nc. also subleading
are contributions in which the three paths are non-equal. using this expres-

sion and the formulae derived in the appendix, it is possible to compute the

expectation values of products of 3-gluino operators. now the wick expan-

sion gives a total of 6 terms (once the nc-subleading ones are discarded).

these terms ensure that if the colour invariant tensor is f or d, the spin ma-
trix sj can be chosen completely symmetric or antisymmetric respectively,
as required by fermi statistics. with this choice the 6 terms give the same

contribution, and the correlation function can be written as:

where p(x) is an appropriate combination of adjoint plaquettes in the

factor, the adjoint gauge eld f (x). this has the advantage of including

only gauge variables in the adjoint representation, allowing the use of our

integration formulas. however, by examining the strong coupling large nc

expansion of the correlation of 2 such operators, one easily realizes that it is

given by combinations of triple paths joining the two operators. thus, we

expect that the mass spectrum following from 3-gluino ultralocal operators

would include also the states coupled to (41).

to conclude we simply want to mention that in a similar way one can

obtain expressions for expectation values and correlations of p-gluino opera-

tors. no additional diculty arises, and the nal expression looks just like
eq. (35) but with corresponding functions and matrices rp, p, cp, and ap.

3 explicit results on the propagators and spec-

in this section we will analyse the results on the expectation values presented

in the previous one. our main goal will be the extraction of the spectrum of

the theory at  = 0 and leading order in the 1/nc expansion.

we will rst of all look at the expectation values of single 2-gluino oper-
ators. our main result is formula (24). the only independent operator si
giving a non-vanishing spinorial trace can be chosen as si = c i. on physi-
cal terms, it corresponds to a non-vanishing gluino scalar condensate for the
full range of values where our resummation is valid ( 12
2). once
the dierent normalizations of the elds and operators, and the appropriate

2    1

colour factors are taken into account, this expression coincides with the re-

sult given in ref. [16] for this expectation value when the fermion eld is in

the fundamental representation.

our next step will be to analyse the results for the correlations of two

fermion operators gij(x), and the corresponding (meson) spectrum. the

expression given in the preceding section for the correlation (formula (27))
requires the inversion of a 2d2d matrix. (for odd space-time dimensions one
2]). this matrix is 2()i a2() dened in eqs. (29,30).
must replace d by 2[ d
thus, in even space-time dimensions, it is convenient for the study to choose

as a basis of the 2d-dimensional space of meson operators, those correspond-

ing to bsi being the standard basis of the d-dimensional cliord algebra, for

18

which we adopt the writing:

bs(n)  e(n) n0

0    nd1
d1

,

(44)

where (n) is an appropriate phase which we will choose equal to zero in

corresponding to the gamma matrices , and so on.

what follows. thus, one state of the basis is the scalar operator bss corre-
sponding to the unit matrix, other elements are the vector operators bsv ()
bs(n) associated to the standard basis of the cliord algebra (which is basi-

cally the same as for dimension d  1), but one must take into account that
they are not independent. they are constrained by the identity:

for odd space-time dimensions, one could also consider the operators

0    d1 = kd i ,

(45)

where kd is a phase depending on the space-time dimension.

going back to the even-dimensional case, we have to express the matrix
elements of the matrix a2() within this basis. to do so it is convenient to
view the 2d-dimensional space in question as the fock space of a system of
fermions: the gamma-fermions. each integer n  {0, 1} entering eq. (44)
can be interpreted as the occupation number of the state . it is convenient
to add an additional one-particle state labelled 1 whose usefulness will be
clear in what follows. thus, in the standard second quantization notation

we can write:

bs(n)  |n1, n0, . . . nd1i ,

with bs(n) dened in (44). the extra occupation number n1 is xed to be a

parity bit state, taking the value 1 when the total number of gamma-fermions

in the other states is odd and the value 0 if it is even. hence, in both cases,

this imposes the constraint that the total number of fermions must be even.

19

(46)

with this convention it is possible to express the matrix a2() in terms of
creation and annihilation operators of these fermions as follows:

a2() = 2(2(r2  1 + 2a+
4rpd1

1a1)  2(4a+
=0 sin()(a+
with  =pd1

1a1  2)pd1

1a)) ,

 a1 + a+
=0 cos() .

=0 cos()a+

 a 

(47)

we see that the operator conserves the number of gamma-fermions. hence,
each even number of gamma-fermions 2p characterizes a block in which a2()
can be diagonalized or inverted. within each block one has two subspaces
corresponding to n1 = 1 and n1 = 0, which correspond to the product of
2p  1 and 2p gamma matrices respectively. the matrix a2() mixes these
2 subspaces.

let us clarify the previous formulae by looking at a few examples. if p = 0,

we have the gamma-fermionic fock vacuum state, which is an eigenstate of
a2() with eigenvalue 22(r2  1). this state is precisely the scalar meson
operator. next, we consider the space of 2p = 2 gamma-fermions. the
subsector n1 = 1 corresponds to the vector operators (bsv () = ) and the
n1 = 0 to tensor states (bst () = ). the conclusion is that vector and

tensor states mix between themselves but not with other states. considering

the space of 2p gamma-fermions, we conclude that the operators associated
to the product of 2p  1 dirac gamma matrices mix with those involving 2p
gamma matrices, but with no other states. the inversion or diagonalization

problem has been considerably simplied with this technique. this is the

generalization of the block structure found by previous authors studying

qcd at strong coupling [15].

in the previous analysis we have not taken into account the restriction

imposed by the fact that our gluinos are majorana. as mentioned before, in

20

this case if the operators involve the product of the gluino elds at the same
point (ultralocal operators), the matrices si can be chosen antisymmetric.
this restriction translates in our language into p being an even number: the

number of gamma fermions must be a multiple of 4. thus, for instance,

the only relevant blocks in d = 4 for this ultralocal operators are the scalar

singlet and the p = 2 containing the pseudoscalar (5) and the axial vector

(5).

we now introduce an important symmetry of the operator given in (47).

this is the unitary transformation c related to the charge conjugation of

gamma-fermions:

ca+
 c = a
1c = a1

ca+

c|0i = kd |1, . . . , 1i .

(48)

(49)

(50)

up to a phase the operation exchanges occupied by empty for all states. one

can easily see that the previous transformation commutes with the operator
a2() given in expression (47). notice, that with this change a state with 2p
gamma-fermions changes into one with (d+12p), which for even space-time
dimensions (d = 2s) is an odd number. we see that the spaces with an odd

number of gamma fermions are useful after all. thus, there is a hierarchy

of complexity in the fock space of gamma-fermions as the number grows.

the fock vacuum corresponding to the scalar operator is an eigenstate of
a2(). next, comes the 1-particle space, which through charge conjugation
of gamma-fermions corresponds to the operator involving the matrix  
0    d1 and .
in what follows we will proceed to invert the matrix
2()i  a2() and obtain the propagator for these simplest cases.

before proceeding to the inversion, let us comment about the necessary

21

changes to deal with an odd-space time dimension d. in this case we might

introduce gamma-fermions as well, but due to the constraint (45) there are

actually 2 states corresponding to the same operator. however, with a bit

of eort one can show that the two states are precisely the 2 states that
are mapped by the transformation c, provided kd is chosen equal to kd
entering in eq. (45). with this choice, one can see that for odd space-time

dimension expression (47) remains valid, but that the physical space of meson

operators has to be identied with the subspace of the gamma-fermion fock

space which is invariant under c and has an even number of gamma-fermions.

with this in mind all that follows can be applied to even and odd space-time

dimensions equally.

now we consider the scalar state (corresponding to the unit matrix) rst.

indeed, to comply with the normalization chosen for the d = 4 case in ta-
2 ]i. the matrix a2() reduces here to the constant
22(r2  1). then we can directly write the momentum-space propagator
explicitly:

ble 1, we take bss = 2 1

2 [ d

where we have dened the following functions:

2x(1  x)

and ,  and dr are the ones dened in section 2. the function 2 is
decreasing for all  6= 0 in the convergence interval, and in addition satises
the following properties:

2(1/2) = d

bgss() =

h(x) =  dr(2d  1)(cid:0)1 + 2d2

2d1 x(cid:1)

(1  x)2(2d  1) + x2

2(x) =

,

(51)

(52)

  (0, 1/2)  2() > d

 < 0  2() < d .

next, for even space-time dimension, we proceed to study the space of 1

gamma-fermion. as mentioned previously it corresponds to the matrix  (5

in 4 dimensions) and . expression (47) reduces in this case to:

a2() = 22(r2  1) + 2

d1x,=1

t a+

 a ,

(53)

where

t1 1 = 4

t1  = t 1 = 4r sin()

t  = 4 cos() .

(54)

now the propagator can be obtained by inverting the matrix 2i  t . this
can be done by making a non-unitary change of variables which brings t to a
diagonal matrix up to a 22 block. in this way, one obtains the expression for

the propagator in momentum space bg(p a) in the 1-gamma fermion sector, i.e.,

the axial vector and the pseudoscalar block in d = 4. to make a contact with

the usual conventions, we change the normalization of the operators to the
forms (remember d is even) p = 2d/4 and a() = 2d/4, generalizing

again the 4-dimensional ones given in table 1. the result is:

2

bgp p () = h() d +
d1x=0
bgp a()() = bga()p () =

where h and 2 are the quantities dened in eqs. (52), and the functions

obtaining momentum-space propagators for other blocks is feasible, but the

expressions become more and more complicated. furthermore, for ultralo-

cal operators in 4 dimensions, the previous propagators are the only non-

vanishing ones. thus, we will focus in what follows on the analysis of the

meson spectrum.

the lattice masses are the minima of the lattice energies as we vary the

spatial momentum ~. these minima can only occur at special momenta
~ = ~(special) ((special)

= 0, ). the advantage is that now sin((special)

) =

i

i

0, which simplies expression (47) considerably. the procedure to obtain
the masses is the following: extract the eigenvalues of the matrix 2()i 
a2(~(special)), which are functions of the temporal momentum 0. then
determine pole
, the (complex) value of 0 for which the eigenvalue vanishes.
the lattice masses are now given by m = log(|epole
|). this coincides with
the denition of mass as the exponent controlling the decay of correlation

0

24

functions at long times.

now let us proceed to obtain the eigenvalues. by looking at expres-

sion (47), one sees that the matrix is diagonal except for the term propor-
tional to (a+
1a0). thus, the occupation numbers of the spatial states
ni are not changed by the operator. hence, for xed values of these num-

0 a1 +a+

bers, the operator reduces to a 4 by 4 matrix: an operator acting on the
two-state fermion system labelled by n1 and n0. furthermore, the states
having n1 = n0 = 0 and n1 = n0 = 1 are eigenstates of the matrix
a2(~(special)). the other two states are mixed, but nding the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors is trivial, since it is a 2  2 matrix. we can summarise the
results obtained in the following formulae:

a2(~(special))|0, 0, ~ni = (22(r2  1) cos(0) + 22r2  22 ) |0, 0, ~ni
a2(~(special))|1, 1, ~ni = (22(r2  1) cos(0) + 22r2 + 22 ) |1, 1, ~ni
22(r2 + (r2 + 1) cos(0) p 2  4r2 sin2(0))|mixed , ~ni ,

a2(~(special))|mixed , ~ni =

(57)

where we have introduced the following notation:

i=1 i

 =pd1
 =pd1

i=1 (1)nii
 = 1

r21
 = r2+1
r21

(58)

i = cos(i)  {1, 1} .

from these eigenvalues one can apply the previously described procedure

and obtain the formulae for the masses m(n1, n0, n1, . . . , nd1):

cosh(m(0, 0, ~n)) = | +  |

(59)

25

cosh(m(1, 1, ~n)) = |   |

cosh(m(mixed , ~n)) =   p(2  1)(2  1) +  22

with  = 2()  r2 ,

(60)

(61)

where 2() is dened in eq. (52) and the remaining symbols in (58).

now let us discuss these results. all the dependence on the occupation

numbers ni lies in the quantity  . on the other hand, both  and  depend

on the choice i = 0, . from the denition of  one sees that its maximum

positive value is obtained whenever all states having i = 1 are empty and
those with i = 1 occupied. the maximum negative value is attained in the
opposite situation. in both cases, the maximal absolute value is the same:
d  1. let us now comment briey on the main features of the spectrum
formulae:

n1 = n0 sectors
this sector contains the scalar state corresponding to n1 = n0 = ni = 0,
whose mass is given by:

cosh(ms) = |2()  | .

(62)

for |r| > 1 ( > 0) the scalar ground state corresponds to zero momentum
~ = ~0. for |r| < 1 ( < 0) it corresponds to the doubler state i = . the
state with minimum mass within these sectors corresponds to || = d  1
and i = 0, which is the state associated to the matrix 0. its corresponding

mass is:

cosh(mv ) = |2()  (d  1)| .

(63)

26

n1 + n0 = 1 sector
let us consider rst even space-time dimensions. in that case this sector has

lighter states than the previous one. notice that the argument of the square
root in eq. (61) can be written as (   1)2  ((  )2   22). thus, the
lightest state corresponds to the maximum value of || = d1. furthermore,
one can prove that the mass decreases with ||, and hence the lightest state
corresponds to i = 0. combining this with the maximal  one sees that this

lightest state corresponds to  and 0 ( 5 and 05 in 4 dimensions). its
mass is given by formula (61) with  = 2()  (d  1)r2 and || = d  1.
the corresponding critical line, where this lightest meson becomes massless,

marks the edge of the physical region. it also marks the boundary of validity

of our formulae. the equation for this critical line is given by:

2() = d  .

(64)

along this line, the other meson states have a positive denite mass. the only

exception occurs for  = 1 ( = 0). the latter is an interesting region, where

all the meson masses are degenerate and dependent only on . all states
become massless at  = 1
2. notice that the region corresponds to the limit
r  ,   0 with r xed. if we look at the expression of the action in
this limit we see that the normal dirac term becomes negligible with respect

to the wilson term. we have then essentially the masses corresponding to

the scalar-gauge theory. unphysical features could be expected to arise in
this limit, because, as we commented in the previous section, |r| > 1 would
be forbidden by the requirement of osterwalder-schrader positivity at the

lattice level. however, it can be checked that the meson propagators in this

limit satisfy the positivity condition.

if we solve in this even-dimensional case for the critical hopping 2

c which

27

denes the critical line as a function of r we get, in particular, the result
2
c(r = 1) = 1/4d, in agreement with the well-known 2
d = 4 [15]-[18].

c(r = 1) = 1/16 for

for odd space dimensions the previous analysis has to be modied. now,
it is not possible to satisfy || = d  1 and i = 0 simultaneously, due to the
requirement that the number of gamma-fermions must be even. thus, the

lightest state has a higher mass. this state is a mixed vector-tensor state (i
and 0i). the critical line is given by |2() (d 1)| = 1 and corresponds
to a massless vector meson. for r > 1 this massless state is obtained for
~ = ~0 and for r < 1 it corresponds to one direction being i = . there are
no other massless particles except for r  .

after this general presentation, we will now restrict ourselves to the most

interesting cases of 3 and 4 dimensions, where the continuum theory is su-

persymmetric. we will start by considering d = 4. the formulae for the

propagators and masses follow from the general formulae obtained previ-

ously. the normalization of our operators in this case is given in table 1. as

mentioned previously, if we consider correlation functions of ultralocal oper-

ators the only non-zero ones for majorana fermions are the scalar (s) and

the pseudoscalar-axial (pa) sectors. for ease of access to the results we now

collect the expressions for the scalar mass ms and the lightest pseudoscalar

mass mp :

(65)

cosh(ms) = |2()  3|

cosh (mp ) =   p(2  1)(2  1) + 92 ,

where the  in cosh(ms) is for |r| < 1 and |r| > 1, respectively. we recall

28

the expression for 2 and  in this dimension:

2(x) =

8x2  14x + 7
2x(1  x)
 = 2()  3r2 .
,  and  are, as usual, the ones in eqs. (25, 58).

the critical line where the pseudoscalar particle becomes massless is given

by  = c(r), where the critical hopping parameter 2
23r2 + 9 + 39r4 + 46r2 + 9

c is given by:

.

(66)

2
c(r) =

896r4

our formulae are equal for elds in the fundamental and the adjoint

representation of the group, so that up to a normalization factor, they can be

directly compared with the results obtained previously on the literature [15]-

[18]. once the appropriate normalization of the elds is taken into account,

we nd perfect agreement with the results obtained by previous authors.

now we discuss the d = 3 case, for which no explicit results have been

given previously. the expression for the propagator does not follow from

our previous formulae. in this case the basis of meson operators is given by

the set of 2 by 2 matrices bsi = {1, i}, where i are the pauli matrices.

to comply with the conventional indexing of the pauli matrices, we will

adopt the names (1, 2, 3) for the lattice momentum coordinates, time

being assigned by convention to coordinate 1.

it is easy to see that here

the propagator splits into two separate blocks: the scalar and the vectorial

sector, corresponding to the unit matrix and pauli matrices respectively. by
inverting the matrix 2()i  a2() we nd the following results for the
scalar bgss() and vectorial bgv v () propagators:

by

(69)

for d = 3, the functions h and 2 adopt the form:

2(cid:19)
h(x) =  dr (cid:18)5

2(x) =

6x2  10x + 5
2x(1  x)

4x  5

x(x  1)(6x  5)
.

(70)

let us now consider meson masses. the general formulae (59)-(61) are

valid for this case. the restriction to gamma-fermion states which are eigen-

states of the charge conjugation operator c simply eliminates the double

degeneracy of all levels. taking into account the necessary evenness of the

number of gamma-fermions, we arrive at:

cosh(ms) = 2   =  + 
cosh(m11) = 2   =   

cosh(mmix) =   p(2  1)(2  1) + 2(4  2) ,

(73)

where, as usual,  = p3

i=2 i, and i  cos(i) takes values {1, 1}.  is
dened below eq. (61). the analysis of the lightest meson follows the general

presentation done previously for odd space-time dimension.

finally, we will consider correlation functions of the 3-gluino operators

given in eq. (33). we recall that depending on the choice of the invariant
colour tensor (f or d) the spin matrix si can be chosen completely symmetric
or completely antisymmetric under the exchange of the 3 spinorial indices.

the general expression for the propagator was given in section 2 (eq. (35)),
and involves the inversion of the matrix 3()i  a3. although performing
this inversion explicitly in general seems a fairly complicated problem, we

will be able to perform it inversion for the simplest case. this corresponds
to a completely antisymmetric si matrix. actually, for d = 4 it gives the
full antisymmetric subspace. we proceed by introducing the antisymmetric
matrices aa, where a is an spinorial index which can be looked at as the
spin components of a composite fermion (a spin 1/2 fermion in 4 dimensions).
the form of aa is given by:

(aa)a1a2a3 = c a1a2c a3a  c a1a3c a2a + c a2a3c a1a ,

(74)

3 |aai are the basis of
an invariant subspace under the action of a3. this allows us to perform the
aa the momentum
space propagator between the states si = aa and sj = aa, we can write:
aa = r3() (6  3t r(ispin)) 

the advantage of these matrices is that the states ec1
appropriate inversion in this subspace. if we label by bg(a)
bg(a)
 c[(3()  23r(r2  1))i + 23(r2  1)x

sin()]1!

(75)
,

aa

where t r(ispin) is the dimension of the spin space (equal to 2d/2 for even d)

and  =p cos(). the inversion of the matrix contained in the previous

31

formula can be done in the standard way for a fermion propagator: (a +
b)1 = (a  b)/(a2  b2
).

setting as usual the space-like momenta to 0 or , we might extract the

mass of this fermion state from the position of the pole in the propagator.

the result is:

cosh(m 1

2

) = r3 p(3)2  

,

where we recall that  = 1/(r2  1) and the symbol 3 stands for:

3 =

3()2

23  r

(76)

(77)

with  =pi cos((special)

i

). it can be shown that, although the mass formula

depends on the sign of  and r, the spectrum does not. without loss of
generality, we can set  > 0; then, the lowest mass is obtained for ~ = ~0
when r > 1 or 1 < r < 0, and for i =  i when r < 1 or 0 < r < 1.

obtaining the remaining masses of 3 gluino states analytically in general

is a complicated problem. nevertheless, we do not need them for the phys-

ical conclusions of this paper. indeed as we saw in the case of mesons the

only point in parameter space were the scalar and the pseudoscalar became

degenerate in mass occurred for   0, r   with r =  xed. ex-

tracting the masses and propagators for all p-gluino states in this limit is

fairly simple. as in the case of mesons all spin states are degenerate, and

the masses only depend on . by looking at the expressions (42,43) for the

matrix to be inverted when considering a p-gluino operator, we immediately

see that:

pi  ap

r (p  2prp)i .

(78)

now, the eigenvalues, whose zeroes gives the masses, are explicit. their value

32

is given by:

cosh(mp) =  (cid:18)(2d  1)(1  )



(cid:19)p/2!   ,

(79)

where we have used the denition (25) of  and introduced the function

(x) = x +

(2d  1)

x

.

(80)

as p increases (cid:16) (2d1)(1)

, the argument of the function  in (79), in-
creases. it is easy to see that within the relevant range (x  1) the function
(x) is monotonously increasing. this allows us prove the following inequal-



(cid:17)p/2

lity:

mp > mq

for p > q

(81)

as a consequence for any value of  in the physical range [0, 1

2 ] and i = 0,
the mass of the 3-gluino states is higher than the mass of the 2-gluino states.
in particular at the critical point  = 1

2, the 3-gluino states are massive.

4 conclusions and future outlook

in this section we will summarise our results and discuss their implications.

we have obtained the spectrum of n=1 susy yang-mills on the lattice at

large number of colours nc and strong coupling, by considering the hopping

parameter expansion as a sum over lattice paths (random walks). we have

been able to resum the expressions in the hopping parameter in a certain

region enclosing the origin, for an arbitrary value of the wilson parameter

r. we have worked at zeroth order in , the pure gauge coupling constant.

however, wilsons action for the gauge part can be added either as a trace

in the fundamental representation or as a trace in the adjoint one, with the

33

corresponding couplings related to match the same naive continuum limit.

indeed, if we choose the adjoint version of wilson action, our results (prop-

agators and masses) are valid to all orders in  (probably only within some

region encircling the origin). this can be proven in the same way that one

sees that the quenched approximation is exact in our case.

we have given formulae for the propagators and masses of 2 and 3 gluino

states. the 2-gluino masses do coincide with the results for the meson spec-

trum in ordinary lattice qcd at strong coupling [16]-[18], and obtained

by means of the eective potential method. our method makes use of

the resummation formulae derived in [20]. this generalises the method of
kawamoto [15] for r 6= 1. both methods have their relative advantages and
disadvantages and occasionally there have been some conicting conclusions

(see the u(1) problem discussion in refs. [18] and [19]). the random walk

method does not rely on specic assumptions about the symmetries of the

saddle point solution. it is rather based on the resummation of convergent

series. convergence is simple to see, since the number of lattice paths of

length l grows like a power of l and the matrices involved are bounded.

the radius of convergence is given by the distance to the nearest singularity.

paths, which converges provided 2 <

in our case, we have two resummations involved. one on the pure spike
4(2d1)(r21), and a second one whose
border line in four dimensions, is given by the critical line (eq. (66)) where

1

the pseudoscalar becomes massless. furthermore, in our case, the replace-

ment of the pfaan by the square root of the determinant can be rigorously
2d(|r|+1). this falls a bit too short compared to the other lim-
justied if || <
its. finally, we want to stress that we have provided formulae for arbitrary

1

space-time dimensions d, which could be of interest for other researchers in

the eld.

apart from the technical interest of our method and results, we consider

that the main usefulness of our results, is that they provide a guideline and

boundary formulae for groups investigating this model by monte carlo sim-

ulations. of course, our results are only valid for large nc, but experience

teaches us that this is frequently a numerically good approximation. there

is one issue in which unfortunately our method could perhaps not help. it

has been predicted, that this model should have a rst order phase transition

in  [23]. our work predicts the presence of a second order phase transition

associated to the vanishing of the pseudoscalar mass. it can be argued how-

ever, that a series expansion like ours can be seen as the expansion around

one of the eective potential vacua. thus, the mentioned second order tran-

sition could lie in the metastable phase. the point about the order of the

phase transition should be settled by future monte carlo simulations.

finally, it is tempting to speculate about the relevance of our results in

the spirit of supersymmetry breaking. for that purpose one is interested

in critical lines where a continuum limit can be dened. the states whose

lattice mass vanish at the critical line, are the states that survive this con-

tinuum limit.

if supersymmetry is recovered at this continuum limit one

expects these states to form a supermultiplet. the analysis of curci and

veneziano leads to a multiplet in which in addition to the pseudoscalar par-
ticle, there is a scalar one and a spin 1

2 fermion. these particles have equal
positive continuum masses. since the contribution to the mass of the pseu-

doscalar comes through the anomaly, which vanishes in our case, we should

expect a massless multiplet. nevertheless, it is doubtful that the analysis

of curci and veneziano applies at strong coupling since it is based on the

continuum susy yang-mills lagrangian. by power counting, this model has

a single relevant parameter, the gluino mass, and hence ne tuning one of

35

the bare couplings one could nd a line corresponding to vanishing mass and

restored supersymmetry. however, at strong coupling the gluonic degrees of

freedom stay of the order of the cut-o. hence, the low energy lagrangian, if

supersymmetric, would rather coincide with the wess-zumino model. this

has many more relevant operators (the dierent masses and couplings) and

demands tuning of more bare parameters to approach it.

in this respect

the situation in 3 dimensions could be interesting since the model would be

interacting. in 4 dimensions we would expect a free low energy lagrangian

giving the physics of the continuum limit. with all these concerns in mind
we did not want to loose the opportunity to explore the   r parameter
space in search for degenerate low energy multiplets. actually, we concluded

that the only point where several mesons become massless is in the limit
2). the masses at this point are
  0, r   and r =
the ones corresponding to a gauge-higgs system: an interesting model in its

22d1 (i.e.,  = 1

1

own right. at this point we looked at the masses of the p-gluino states with

p > 2. this includes fermionic degrees of freedom (for p odd). however,

we showed that these states remain massive (in cut-o units) at this critical
point. so that the main conclusion is that there is no point in the  r plane
giving a possible candidate for a supersymmetric continuum limit.

we conclude the paper by mentioning a few possible improvements of our

results. first of all, the possibility of extending the calculations and formulae

to next to leading order in 1/nc seems a feasible one. the most important

consequence of this extension could be in cases when the eects are absent

to leading order, like the eect of quenching, anomalies, etc. then one can

try to include higher orders in f undamental, or combined 1/nc and adjoint.

then, of course, it would be very good to rederive the results of this paper

with the eective action method. this technique, as mentioned previously,

36

would allow the discovery of possible rst order phase transitions. finally, it

should be commented that our methods and results could be used to study

other supersymmetric models, such as susy qcd.

appendix

in this appendix we will present the terminology and main results on random

walks that we will need in the text. not to conict with other denitions,

we will refer to these random walks as lattice paths and a precise denition

will be provided. we will work in arbitrary dimension d and will employ

additional denitions given at the beginning of section 2. proofs will not be

given. for that we address the reader to ref. [20].

n +pl

a lattice path of length l is an element   (n, ~)  l  i l. the
point n  l is the origin of the path, ~ is the path sequence, and m =
i=1 v(i) is the endpoint of the path. we can label the dierent path
sets as follows. let sl(n) be the space of all paths with origin n and length
l; sl(n  m) is the space of all paths with origin n, endpoint m and length
l. now we will introduce the notion of a spike.

a path   (n, 1, . . . , l) has spikes if there exist one integer 1  i  l

37

such that i+1 = i.

in the converse case one says that the path has no

spikes. the set of all paths without spikes of length l and origin n is
labelled sl(n) ( sl(n  m) if the endpoint is xed to m). now, we can
associate to any path  a corresponding path  called its reduced path, by

simply eliminating in an orderly manner all pairs i+1 = i in its sequence.

notice that this procedure preserves the origin and endpoint of the path.

our main strategy will be to convert the sum of paths into a sum over

reduced paths. for that we would rst need to compute the following func-

tion:

f ( l, z) =

xp=0

zp n( l, p) ,

(82)

where n( l, p) is the number of paths of length l + 2p whose reduced path
is a path (with no spikes) of length l. this number does not depend on the

path itself but only on its length. in ref. [20] it is shown that:

f ( l, z) =

 =

1

1
(1  ) l
(1  2d
2d1 )
1 p1  4(2d  1)z
.

(83)

(84)

in addition, we would need to be able to perform sums over the set of

reduced paths with origin in n of a product of matrices. to be specic, let
a for   i, be a collection of matrices satisfying aa  = i, with i the
unit matrix. then we want to compute the matrix:

t (a) = 1 +

xl=1 x(n,~) sl(n)

a1    a l.

it can be shown [20] that t (a) is given by the formula:
t (a) = (1  )(1 + (2d  1)  a)1 ,

(85)

(86)

38

where a =pi a.

in the text we will need to evaluate an expression like eq. (85) with a

slight variation. we would need to sum only over paths going from one lattice

point x to another one y. this modied situation can be reduced to the case

given before by the following procedure. instead of considering the matrix
a we will multiply it by a phase e, where  = . then, diagrams
that go from x to y have coecients that go like e(xy). thus, the required

expression can be obtained by projecting onto this term:

2 (cid:19) e(xy) (1  )(1 + (2d  1)  a())1 , (87)

txy(a) =y (cid:18)z d
with a() =pi e a.
