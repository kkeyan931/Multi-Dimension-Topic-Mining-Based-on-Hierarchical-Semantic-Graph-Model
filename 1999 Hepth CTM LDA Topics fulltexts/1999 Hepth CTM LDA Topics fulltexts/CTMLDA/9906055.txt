(2.6) case type 0a, theory two 1-forms two 3-forms r-r sector, whereas type 0b two scalars, two 2-forms, 4-form (with unrestricted 5-form eld strength). states r-r sector type 0a type 0b therefore doubled compared type iia type iib. 2.2 d-branes doubling r-r tensor elds suggests d-brane spectrum type 0a type 0b doubled compared corresponding type ii theories. indeed conrmed careful analysis boundary states two theories {$9701137$}. let us briey summarise clarify analysis. typical boundary state world-sheet supersymmetric closed string theory labelled integer p {1, . . . , 9} determines number dirichlet neumann conditions, two spin structures, , either ns-ns r-r describes closed string sector state belongs, = . dening equations are2 (2.7) n)|bp, = 0 r)|bp, = 0 ) = 0, . . . , p r)|bp, = 0 ) = p + 1, . . . , 9 . n)|bp, = 0 ( ( ( ( n e r ie n + e r + ie n zz, r zz (zz + 1/2) =r-r (ns-ns). normalisation, equations determine unique state , |bp, +ins-ns , |bp,ins-ns , |bp, +ir-r , |bp,ir-r . (2.8) boundary states must physical closed string states, thus must invariant gauge symmetries closed string theory. include gso transformation(s), 2there also equations ghost superghost oscillators, independent p spin structures. 5 well orientifold orbifold transformations, appropriate. type ii theories implies combinations |bp, +ins-ns + |bp,ins-ns |bp, +ir-r + |bp,ir-r p p =( even iia odd iib (2.9) allowed.3 type 0 theories hand, four boundary states (2.8) invariant gso projection (2.4), analogous restriction value p r-r sector. key property boundary states tree-level amplitude describes propa- gation one another reexpressed, world-sheet duality, one-loop open string vacuum amplitude. relevant amplitudes given (2.10) = r dl hbp, | elhclosed |bp, ins-ns r dl hbp, | elhclosed |bp,ins-ns = 1 r dl hbp, | elhclosed |bp, ir-r = r dl hbp, | elhclosed |bp,ir-r = 1 2r dt 2r dt 2r dt 2r dt 1 1 trn shethopeni trrhethopeni trn shethopen(1)fi trrhethopen(1)fi = 0 . leads additional consistency conditions, since spectrum open strings introduced presence boundary states, well interactions closed strings, must consistent. typically, d-brane states therefore linear combinations boundary states; satisfy following two conditions: (a) pair d-branes, open string amplitude corresponds partition function open string theory, i.e. takes form sum traces sets open string states time evolution operator ethopen. (b) open-closed vertex describes joining two ends open string form closed string well-dened physical states. one usually also interested d-branes stable; equivalent condition spectrum open strings begin end d-brane free tachyons. underlying theory supersymmetric, one may also want impose condition d-branes preserve supersymmetry, i.e. bps saturated; requires spectrum open strings beginning ending d-brane supersymmetric. 3the normalisation state |bp,ins-ns chosen minus used . 6 |ddpi =(cid:16)|bp, +ins-ns + |bp,ins-ns(cid:17) (2.12) type ii theories bps stability conditions equivalent.4 select linear combinations type ii : |dpi =(cid:16)|bp, +ins-ns + |bp,ins-ns(cid:17) (cid:16)|bp, +ir-r + |bp,ir-r(cid:17) , (2.11) p even (odd) type iia (iib). relative sign r-r ns-ns components determines sign r-r charge carried d-brane, therefore dierentiates brane anti-brane. applying (2.10), immediately follows (a) satised. also generally believed (b) satised states, although never completely veried knowledge. ns-ns component (2.11) actually satises (a) (and presumably (b)) itself, non-supersymmetric, fact unstable due presence open string tachyon. combinations given therefore correspond unstable (and non-bps) d-branes. such, really seen part spectrum type ii string theory. nevertheless, unstable d-branes useful intermediaries describing descent relations among d-branes type ii theories . type 0 theories, property (a) implies one take either combination ns-ns state r-r state, ns-ns state, former stable. type ii theories, property (b) completely analysed. however, one immediate implication (b) spectrum open strings begin end d-brane must free fermions; so, closed string fermions, absent closed string spectrum, would emerge open-closed vertex. condition implies (see {$9701137$} detailed discussion) various (stable) states consistent (a), eight linear combinations remain |bp, ins-ns |bp, ir-r , (2.13) p even (odd) type 0a (0b). number reduced imposing condition (a) amplitudes involving two dierent d-branes.5 requires that, eight combinations above, keep four = , four = . amplitude one former states propagate one latter states corresponds trace open string states insertion (1)f , rather 1 projection operator, therefore violates condition (a). hand, amplitudes involving states = (or = ) 4in theories, type i, certain orbifolds type ii, tachyon-free open string spectrum also achieved without supersymmetry, resulting stable non-bps d-branes . 5this condition considered {$9701137$}; however d-branes relevant description duality paper satised it. see also {$9811156$} related discussion dierent context. 7 correspond traces projected sets open string states, therefore satisfy (a). let us x conventions keeping four combinations = ; describe two possible d-branes (and d-antibranes), type 0 : |dp, +i = |bp, +ins-ns |bp, +ir-r |dp,i = |bp,ins-ns |bp,ir-r . (2.14) restriction also obtained {$9811035$} using dierent method. argued d-branes carry opposite charges respect r-r elds twisted sector also couple tachyon twisted ns-ns sector opposite signs. signs charges turn related spin structures follows; two r-r boundary states = carry equal (unit) charges untwisted r-r elds, opposite charges twisted r-r elds. (this obvious consequence fact type ii d-branes (2.11) charged untwisted elds.) similarly, two ns-ns boundary states couple tachyon opposite signs. argument {$9811035$} implies two spin structures must correlated, reducing allowed d-brane states (2.14). open string spectra associated d-branes easily read two relevant amplitudes, = (2.15) trn shethopen 1 r dt r dl hdp, | elhclosed |dp, trrhethopen 1 r dl hdp, | elhclosed |dp,i = r dt 2 (1 + (1)f )i 2 (1 + (1)f )i . particular, open strings like d-branes purely bosonic, whereas unlike d-branes (of equal p) purely fermionic. corresponding massless excitations appropriate dimensional reduction ten-dimensional vector ten-dimensional majorana- weyl spinor, respectively. brane-antibrane amplitudes sign front (1)f reversed. thus open string brane anti-brane type contains tachyon (but massless vectors), open string brane one type anti-brane fermions opposite chirality. 2.3 open strings various dirichlet-branes, particular d9-branes, play crucial role construc- tion (open string) orientifold models. although models somewhat peripheral main line paper, shall nevertheless use occasion explain understood terms d-branes. models fall four classes, three obtained type 0b, one type 0a. 0b model 1: like type iib string theory, type 0b invariant world-sheet parity operator , therefore consider corresponding projection. massless string 8 states invariant graviton, dilaton r-r 2-form untwisted sector, well tachyon r-r 2-form twisted sector. one-loop vacuum amplitude new theory contribution klein bottle, k =z dt 2t trclosedhethclosed 1 2 (1 + (1)fl+fr) 1 2 . (2.16) interpreted tree channel, gives rise massless ns-ns tadpole. theory massless r-r tadpole, would arise insertion ((1)fl + (1)fr) trace. presence massless ns-ns tadpole render theory necessarily inconsistent; means vacuum shifted fischler-susskind mechanism {$9810214$}. alternatively, one introduce 64 d9-branes cancel ns-ns tadpole. however, net r-r charge must still vanish, 32 must anti-d9-branes. since two kinds d9-branes type 0b, one introduce n one kind 32n other, together respective anti-branes. analysis previous subsection easily determine spectrum open string theory. particular, gauge group (so(n) so(32 n))2; low lying states given table 1. specic choice n = 0 (or n = 32), resulting theory purely bosonic, gauge group so(32) so(32). singled property one d-strings possesses low-lying modes reproduce world-sheet theory = 26 bosonic string compactied so(32) lattice ten dimensions. led suggestion two models might related strong/weak coupling duality {$9701137$}. 0b model 2: action also combined another zz2 symmetry. particular, r, f r right-moving part space-time massless elds include two scalars 4-form, instead two 2-forms. klein consider operator b diers sign r-r sector {$9509080$}, therefore described b = (1)f fermion number operator. (b order two since b2 = (1)f 1 type 0b.) invariant bottle contribution vacuum amplitude given (2.16), replaced b, therefore massless r-r tadpole vanishes. theory ns-ns tadpole, tachyonic rather massless. since theory closed string tachyon anyway, believed harmless, therefore need introduce branes all. resulting theory thus closed bosonic string theory whose low-lying spectrum shown table 1. 0b model 3: finally, exists third zz2 operator described = (1)fr, . ( order two since ()2 = (1)fl+fr 1 type 0b.) (1)fr, projection removes tachyon. massless level, surviving elds graviton dilaton ns-ns sector, single scalar, single 2-form, 4-form anti- self-dual eld strength r-r sector. replacing klein bottle (2.16) results trace ((1)fl + (1)fr), therefore theory massless r-r tadpole, massless ns-ns tadpole. consistency, tadpole must cancelled introduction d9-branes. since operator (1)fr maps one kind d9-brane (|d9, +i say) 9 (|d9,i) (see ), forced introduce pairs. order cancel r-r tadpole, net number 32 d9-brane pairs required. inclusion d9-branes necessarily introduces massless ns-ns tadpole cannot cancelled (but which, before, render theory necessarily inconsistent). resulting gauge group u(32), theory completely free tachyons. generally, since total number d9-branes restricted, one add arbitrary equal number d9-brane pairs anti-d9-brane pairs background, without introducing r-r tadpole. resulting gauge group u(n) u(32 + n), n denotes number anti-d9-brane pairs. theory tachyons bi-fundamental complex conjugate. 0a model: unlike supersymmetric cousin, type 0a also invariant , therefore consider orientifold {$9509080$}. ns-ns sector, acts way type 0b, therefore leaves graviton, dilaton, tachyon invariant. r-r sector, exchanges two 1-forms two 3-forms, therefore symmetric combinations invariant. resulting theory klein bottle given (2.16), therefore massless ns-ns tadpole, r-r tadpole. cancelled inclusion open string states, leading gauge group so(n) so(32 n), n {1, . . . , 32}. open string spectrum also contains tachyons singlet representation, well symmetric tensor representations either factor. also massless fermions bi-vector representation. terms d-branes, open strings understood originate n unstable d9-branes one type (|dd9, +i, say) 32 n unstable d9-branes type (|dd9,i). tachyons arise open strings begin end like d9-branes (and particular open strings beginning ending d9-brane), massless fermions arise open strings stretch unlike d9-branes. 9-branes carry ns-ns charge therefore cancel ns-ns tadpole. unlike case type 0b, operators b = (1)f r = (1)fr give new open string models applied type 0a. former gives precisely type 0a model before, except anti-symmetric combinations 1-forms 3-forms survive. latter operator generates zz4 rather zz2 symmetry, since 2 = (1)fl+fr +1 ns-ns sector, 1 r-r sector. orbifold (1)fl+fr gives type 0b, resulting model therefore one type 0b open string theories. 3 m-theory type 0 given relation type 0a string theory type iia, one may ask whether strong coupling dynamics former also eleven-dimensional character. obvious candidate eleven-dimensional theory orbifold m-theory (1)f s. type 0a would correspond compactication orbifold circle radius r(m );

(3.5) compactify theory additional circle nine dimensions exchange roles two compact directions, similar arguments suggest m-theory orbifold corresponds e8 e8 heterotic string (see fig. 1(b)). indeed, untwisted sector m-theory orbifold accounts n = 1 gravity supermultiplet, twisted sectors provide two e8 gauge multiplets. also shown necessary order cancel gravitational anomaly due boundaries. present case, however, orbifold (1)f ss introduce gravitational anomaly, therefore clear symmetry would violated twisted sector absent. limit r(m ) 0 twisted sector orbifold include tachyon additional massless 1-form 3-form eld. possible, principle, since action orbifold depend r(m ), elds massive large r(m ) may become massless, even tachyonic, r(m ) 0. conversely, additional r-r elds type 0a become massive non-zero coupling, tachyon become massive suciently strong coupling. therefore tachyonic instability disappears strong coupling regime, theory proceeds ow back eleven dimensions. 3.3 t-duality type 0b well known s1 compactications type iia type iib string theories related t-duality; symmetry inverts radius circle, exchanges winding momentum states, changes sign (1)fr right-moving r-sector. similarly, t-duality circle relates type 0a type 0b one another. 14 9 2/r(ii) 9 transformation nine-dimensional theories described subsection 3.1 t- duality somewhat complicated. t-duality still exchanges winding momentum states, requires maps r(ii) even momentum becomes integer winding, odd momentum becomes half-odd-integer winding. t-dual theory spacetime bosons therefore integer winding, whereas spacetime fermions half-odd-integer winding. furthermore, states even (1)fr even momentum, odd (1)fr carry odd momentum. thus follows theory t-dual type iia (iib) s1/(1)f given type 0b (0a) s1/(1)fr (compare also {$9811035$}). equivalent sequence duality transformations given {$9811035$}, 9-10 ip (fig. 1(a)), allowed us identify type 0a m-theory s1/(1)f ss, g g/r : r 1/r , g g/r : r 2/r , : r g1/2r , g 1/g .
