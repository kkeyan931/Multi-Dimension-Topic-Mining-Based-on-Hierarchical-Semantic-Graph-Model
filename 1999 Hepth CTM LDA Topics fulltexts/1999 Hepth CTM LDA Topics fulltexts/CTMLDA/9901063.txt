nevertheless even though nite k number eld degrees freedom considerably enlarged seems possible track original degrees freedom cut-o scale k. 5.3 background elds finally, discuss third option actually

even though ow equation still peaked (covariant) momenta k obvious dependence eective action background eld non-trivial. one employ additional equation track dependence, adds ow equation bigger set
