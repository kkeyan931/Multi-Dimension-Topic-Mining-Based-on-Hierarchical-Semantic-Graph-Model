a eld model on bre bundles can be extended in a standard way to the brs-invariant

susy eld model which possesses the lie supergroup isp(2) of symmetries.

introduction

generalizing the brs mechanics of e.gozzi and m.reuter [1-4], we show that any eld
model (independently of its physical symmetries) can be extended in a standard way to a
susy eld model. in comparison with the susy eld theory in ref. [5,6], this extension
is formulated in terms of simple graded manifolds. from the physical viewpoint, the
susy-extended eld theory may describe odd deviations of physical elds, e.g., of a
higgs eld.

we follow the conventional geometric formulation of eld theory where classical elds
are represented by sections of a smooth bre bundle y  x coordinated by (x, yi). a
rst order lagrangian l of eld theory is dened as a horizontal density

l = l(x, yi, yi

) : j 1y 

n
 t x,  = dx1      dxn, n = dim x,

(1)

on the rst order jet manifold j 1y  y of sections of y  x [7-9]. the jet manifold
j 1y coordinated by (x, yi, yi
) plays the role of a nite-dimensional conguration space
of elds. the corresponding eulerlagrange equations take the coordinate form

il = (i  d

i )l = 0,

d =  + yi

i + yi


i .

every lagrangian l (1) yields the legendre map

of j 1y to the legendre bundle

where v y is the vertical cotangent bundle of y  x. the legendre bundle  is equipped
with the holonomic coordinates (x, yi, p
it is seen as a momentum phase space of
covariant hamiltonian eld theory where canonical momenta correspond to derivatives of
elds with respect to all space-time coordinates [8-10]. hamiltonian dynamics on  is
phrased in terms of hamiltonian forms

i ).

h = p

i dyi    h(x, yi, p

i ),

 = .

the corresponding covariant hamilton equations read

yi
 = i

h,

p
i = ih.

(4)

(5)

note that, if x = r, covariant hamiltonian formalism provides the adequate hamil-
tonian formulation of time-dependent mechanics [4, 11]. this fact enables us to extend
the above-mentioned brs mechanics of e.gozzi and m.reuter to eld theory.

a preliminary step toward the desired susy extension of eld theory is its extension
to eld theory on the vertical tangent bundle v y of y  x, coordinated by (x, yi, yi)
[9]. coordinates yi describe linear deviations of elds. the conguration and phase spaces
of eld theory on v y are

j 1v y = v j 1y,
v y

= v ,

(x, yi, yi

, yi, yi

),

(x, yi, p

i , yi, p

i ).

(6)
(7)

due to the isomorphisms (6)  (7), the corresponding vertical prolongation of the lagran-
gian l (1) reads

lv = ( yii + yi



i )l,

while that of the hamiltonian form h (4) is

hv = ( p

i dyi + p

i d yi)    hv ,

hv = ( yii + p

i i

)h.

(8)

(9)

the corresponding eulerlagrange and hamilton equations describe the jacobi elds of
solutions of the eulerlagrange equations (2) and the hamilton equations (5) of the initial
eld model on y .

the susy-extended eld theory is formulated in terms of simple graded manifolds
whose characteristic vector bundles are the vector bundles v j 1v y  j 1v y in lagran-
gian formalism and v v y  v y in hamiltonian formalism [12]. the susy extension
adds to (yi, yi) the odd variables (ci, ci). the corresponding susy extensions of the la-
grangian l (1) and the hamiltonian form h (4) are constructed in order to be invariant
under the brs transformation

uq = cii + i yi 
ci .

2

(10)

moreover, let us consider bre bundles y  x characterized by ane transition functions
of bundle coordinates yi (they are not necessarily ane bundles). almost all eld models
are of this type. in this case, the transition functions of holonomic coordinates yi on v y
are independent of yi, and (ci) and (ci) have the same transition functions. therefore,
brs-invariant lagrangians and hamiltonian forms of the susy-extended eld theory are
also invariant under the lie supergroup isp(2) with the generators uq (10) and

uq = cii  i yi 
ci ,

uk = ci 
ci ,

uk = ci 
ci ,

uc = ci 

ci  ci 
ci .

(11)

note that, since the susy-extended eld theory, by construction, is brs-invariant,

one hopes that its quantization may be free from some divergences.

2 technical preliminaries

given a bre bundle z  x coordinated by (x, zi), the k-order jet manifold j kz is
endowed with the adapted coordinates (x, zi
), 0 |  | k, where  is a symmetric
multi-index (m...1), |  |= m. recall the canonical morphism

 = dx  ( + zi

i) : j 1z 

y

t x 
z

t z.

exterior forms  on a jet manifold j kz, k = 0, 1, . . ., are naturally identied with

their pull-backs onto j k+1z. there is the exterior algebra homomorphism

h0 : dx + idzi 7 ( + 

i yi

)dx,

(12)

called the horizontal projection, which sends exterior forms on j kz onto the horizontal
forms on j k+1z  x. recall the operator of the total derivative

d =  + zi

i + zi



i +    .

a connection on a bre bundle z  x is regarded as a global section

 = dx  ( + i

i)

of the ane jet bundle j 1z  z. one says that a section s : x  z is an integral
section of  if   s = j 1s, where j 1s is the jet prolongation of s to a section of the jet
bundle j 1z  x.

given the vertical tangent bundle v z of a bre bundle z  x, we will use the

notation

i =


 zi ,

v = zii.

3

3 the covariant hamiltonian eld theory

let us summarize briey the basics of the covariant hamiltonian eld theory on the
legendre bundle  (3) [8-10].

let y  x be a bre bundle and l a lagrangian (1) on j 1y . the associated

poincarecartan form

hl = 

i dyi    (

i yi

  l)

is dened as the horizontal lepagean equivalent of l on j 1y  y , i.e. l = h0(hl),
where h0 is the horizontal projection (12). every poincarecartan form hl yields the
bundle morphism of j 1y to the homogeneous legendre bundle

zy = j 1y = t y  (

n1
 t x)

(13)

equipped with the holonomic coordinates (x, yi, p
phism  = v y 
(

n1
 t x), we have the 1-dimensional ane bundle

i , p). because of the canonical isomor-

y

z : zy  .

(14)

the homogeneous legendre bundle zy is provided with the canonical exterior n-form

y = p + p

i dyi.

(15)

then a hamiltonian form h (4) on the legendre bundle  is dened in an intrinsic way
as the pull-back h = hy of this canonical form by some section h of the bre bundle
(14). it is readily observed that the hamiltonian form h (4) is the poincarecartan form
of the lagrangian

lh = h0(h) = (p

i yi

  h)

(16)

on the jet manifold j 1, and the hamilton equations (4) coincide with the eulerlagrange
equations for this lagrangian. note that the lagrangian lh plays a prominent role in
the path integral formulation of hamiltonian mechanics and eld theory.

the legendre bundle  (3) is provided with the canonical polysymplectic form

y = dp

i  dyi    .

given a hamiltonian form h (4), a connection

 = dx  ( + i

i + 

ii
)

4

(17)

(18)

on   x is called a hamiltonian connection for h if it obeys the condition

y = dh,
i
 = i

h,


i = ih.

(19)

every integral section r : x   of the hamiltonian connection  (19) is a solution of
the hamilton equations (5). any hamiltonian form h admits a hamiltonian connection
h (19). a hamiltonian form h (4) denes the hamiltonian map

h j 1 

y

j 1y,

yi
 = i

h,

ch : 

which is the same for all hamiltonian connections associated with h.

in the case of hyperregular lagrangians, lagrangian and covariant hamiltonian for-
malisms are equivalent. for any hyperregular lagrangian l, there exists a unique ha-
miltonian form h such that the eulerlagrange equations (2) for l are equivalent to the
hamilton equations (5) for h. the case of degenerate lagrangians is more intricate. one
can state certain relations between solutions of eulerlagrange and hamilton equations
if a hamiltonian form h satises the relations

p
i i

bl  ch  bl = bl,
h  h = l ch

(20a)
(20b)

[8-10]. it is called associated with a lagrangian l. if the relation (20b) takes place on the

lagrangian constraint space bl(j 1y )  , one says that h is weakly associated with l.

we will show that, if l and h are associated, then their vertical and susy prolongations
are weakly associated.

4 the vertical extension of eld theory

as was mentioned above, the vertical extension of eld theory on a bre bundle y  x
to the vertical tangent bundle v y  x describes linear deviations of elds.

let l be a lagrangian on the conguration space j 1y . due to the isomorphism (6),
its prolongation (8) onto the vertical conguration space j 1v y can be dened as the
vertical tangent morphism

lv = pr2  v l : v j 1y 

lv = v l = ( yii + yi

i )l,

n
 t x,

to the morphism l (1). the corresponding eulerlagrange equations read

ilv = il = 0,
ilv = v il = 0,

v = yii + yi



i + yi



i

.

5

(21)

(22a)
(22b)

the equations (22a) are exactly the eulerlagrange equations (2) for the lagrangian l.
in order to clarify the physical meaning of the equations (22b), let us suppose that y  x
is a vector bundle. given a solution s of the eulerlagrange equations (2), let s be a
jacobi eld, i.e., s + s is also a solution of the same eulerlagrange equations modulo
terms of order > 1 in a parameter . then it is readily observed that the jacobi eld s
satises the eulerlagrange equations (22b).

the lagrangian (21) yields the vertical legendre map

blv = v bl : v j 1y 

i lv = 
i ,

i = 
p

v y

v ,

i = v 
p
i .

(23)

(24)

due to the isomorphism (7), the vertical tangent bundle v  of   x plays the role of
the momentum phase space of eld theory on v y , where the canonical conjugate pairs
are (yi, p
i ) and ( yi, p
i ). in particular, v  is endowed with the canonical polysymplectic
form (17) which reads

v y = v y = [d p

i  dyi + dp

i  d yi]    .

(25)

let zv y be the homogeneous legendre bundle (13) over v y with the corresponding
it can be endowed with the canonical form v y (15).

i , q
coordinates (x, yi, yi, p
sections of the ane bundle

i , p).

zv y  v ,

(26)

by denition, provide hamiltonian forms on v . let us consider the following particular
case of these forms which are related to those on the legendre bundle . due to the bre
bundle

 : v zy  zv y ,
i , q
(x, yi, yi, p

i , p)   = (x, yi, yi, p

i , p

i , p),

(27)

the vertical tangent bundle v zy of zy  x is provided with the exterior form

v =  v y = p + ( p

i dyi + p

i d yi)  .

given the ane bundle zy   (14), we have the bre bundle

v z : v zy  v ,

(28)

where v z is the vertical tangent map to z. the bre bundles (26), (27) and (28)
form the commutative diagram. let h be a section of the ane bundle zy   and
h = h the corresponding hamiltonian form (4) on . then the section v h of the

6

bre bundle (28) and the corresponding section   v h of the ane bundle (26) denes
the hamiltonian form hv = (v h)v (9) on v . one can think of this form as being a
vertical extension of h. in particular, let  (18) be a hamiltonian connection on  for
the hamiltonian form h. then its vertical prolongation

v  =  + dx  [v i


i + v 

i

i
].

on v   x is a hamiltonian connection for the vertical hamiltonian form hv (9) with
respect to the polysymplectic form v y (25).

the hamiltonian form hv (9) denes the lagrangian lhv (16) on j 1v , which takes

the form

lhv = h0(hv ) = [ p

i (yi

  i

h)  yi(p

i + ih) + d(p

i yi)].

the corresponding hamilton equations contain the hamilton equations (5) and the equa-
tions

yi
 = i

hv = v i

h,

p
i = ihv = v ih

for jacobi elds yi =  yi, p

i =  p
i .

the hamiltonian form hv (9) on v  yields the vertical hamiltonian map

chv = vch : v  

hv = i

 = i
yi

v y
h,

v j 1y,

yi
 = v i

h.

(29)

(30)

let h be associated with a lagrangian l. then hv is weakly associated with lv . indeed,

if the morphisms ch and bl obey the relation (20a), then the corresponding vertical tangent

morphisms satisfy the relation

the condition (20b) for hv reduces to the equality

v bl  vch  v bl = v bl.

which is fullled if h is associated with l [8-10].

ih(p) = (il  ch)(p),

p  bl(j 1y ),

5 geometry of simple graded manifolds

following the brs extension of hamiltonian mechanics, we formulate the susy-extended
eld theory in terms of simple graded manifolds.

7

let e  z be a vector bundle with an m-dimensional typical bre v and e  z

the dual of e. let us consider the exterior bundle

 e = r 
(
z

k
 e)

m

k=1

(31)

whose typical bre is the nite grassmann algebra v . by ae is meant the sheaf of its
sections. the pair (z, ae) is a graded manifold with the body manifold z coordinated by
(za) and the structure sheaf ae [13-15]. we agree to call it a simple graded manifold with
the characteristic vector bundle e. this is not the terminology of [16] where this term
is applied to all graded manifolds of nite rank in connection with batchelors theorem.
in accordance with this theorem, any graded manifold is isomorphic to a simple graded
manifold though this isomorphism is not canonical [14, 17]. to keep the structure of a
simple graded manifold, we will restrict transformations of (z, ae) to those induced by
bundle automorphisms of e  z.

global sections of the exterior bundle (31) are called graded functions. they make up
the z2-graded ring ae(z). let {ca} be a basis for e  z with respect to some bundle
atlas with transition functions {a
b (z)cb. we will call (za, ci) the local basis
for the simple graded manifold (z, ae). with respect to this basis, graded functions read

b }, i.e., ca = a

f =

1
k!

mxk=0

fa1...ak ca1    cak,

(32)

where fa1ak are local functions on z, and we omit the symbol of the exterior product of
elements c. the coordinate transformation law of graded functions (32) is obvious. we
will use the notation [.] of the grassmann parity.

given a simple graded manifold (z, ae), by the sheaf derae of graded derivations of
ae is meant a subsheaf of endomorphisms of ae such that any its section u over an open
subset u  z is a graded derivation of the graded algebra ae(u) of local sections of the
exterior bundle e|u , i.e.,

u(f f ) = u(f )f  + (1)[u][f ]f u(f )

for the homogeneous elements u  (derae)(u) and f, f   ae(u). graded derivations
are called graded vector elds on a graded manifold (z, ae) (or simply on z if there is
no danger of confusion). they can be represented by sections of some vector bundle as
follows.

due to the canonical splitting v e = e  e, the vertical tangent bundle v e  e
can be provided with the bre basis {/ca} dual of {ca}. this is the bre basis for
pr2v e = e. then a graded vector eld on a trivialization domain u reads

u = uaa + ua 
ca ,

8

where ua, ua are local graded functions. it yields a derivation of ae(u) by the rule

u(fa...bca    cb) = uaa(fa...b)ca    cb + udfa...b


cd (ca    cb).

(33)

this rule implies the corresponding coordinate transformation law

ua = ua,

ua = a

j uj + uaa(a

j )cj

of graded vector elds. it follows that graded vector elds on z can be represented by
sections of the vector bundle ve  z which is locally isomorphic to the vector bundle

ve |u  e 
z

(pr2v e 
z

t z) |u ,

and has the transition functions

i1...ik = 1a1

of the bundle coordinates (za

the cocycle relations. graded vector elds on z constitute a lie superalgebra with respect
to the bracket

a1...ak, vi

[u, u] = uu + (1)[u][u]+1uu.

there is the exact sequence over z of vector bundles

is the canonical form dza  a on z. the splitting (34) transforms every vector eld 
on z into a graded vector eld


ca ),
which is a graded derivation of ae satisfying the leibniz rule

 =  aa 7  =  a(a +ea

a

(36)

 (sf ) = ( ds)f + s (f ),

f  ae(u),

s  c (z),

u  z.

therefore, one can think of the graded derivation  (36) and, consequently, of the
splitting (34) as being a graded connection on the simple graded manifold (z, ae). in
particular, this connection provides the corresponding decomposition

u = uaa + ua 



ca = ua(a +ea

a

ca ) + (ua  uaea

a)


ca

of graded vector elds on z. note that this notion of a graded connection diers from
that of connections on graded bre bundles in ref. [18].

in accordance with the well-known theorem on a splitting of an exact sequence of

vector bundles, graded connections always exist. for instance, every linear connection

 = dza  (a + a

a

bvba)

on the vector bundle e  z yields the graded connection
bcb 

s = dza  (a + a

a

ca )

(37)

such that, for any vector eld  on z and any graded function f , the graded derivation
 (f ) with respect to the connection (37) is exactly the covariant derivative of f relative
to the connection .

let now z  x be a bre bundle coordinated by (x, zi), and let

 =  + 

a

bvbdx  a

be a connection on e  x which is a linear morphism over a connection  on z  x.
then we have the bundle monomorphism

s : e

given a graded manifold (z, ae), the dual of the sheaf derae is the sheaf derae

generated by the ae-module morphisms

(39)

one can think of its sections as being graded exterior 1-forms on the graded manifold
(z, a). they are represented by sections of the vector bundle v 
e  z which is the
e-dual of ve. this vector bundle is locally isomorphic to the vector bundle

then the morphism (39) can be seen as the interior product

(40)

there is the exact sequence

of vector bundles. any graded connectione (35) yields the splitting of this exact sequence,

and denes the corresponding decomposition of graded 1-forms

adza).

11

graded k-forms  are dened as sections of the graded exterior bundle

k

e such that

   = (1)||||+[][]  ,

where |.| denotes the form degree. the interior product (40) is extended to higher degree
graded forms by the rule

u(  ) = (u)   + (1)||+[][u]  (u).

the graded exterior dierential d of graded functions is introduced in accordance with
the condition udf = u(f ) for an arbitrary graded vector eld u, and is extended uniquely
to higher degree graded forms by the rules

d(  ) = (d)   + (1)||  (d),

d  d = 0.

it takes the coordinate form

d = dza  a() + dca 


ca (),

where the left derivatives a, /ca act on the coecients of graded exterior forms by the
rule (33), and they are graded commutative with the forms dza, dca. the lie derivative
of a graded exterior form  along a graded vector eld u is given by the familiar formula

lu = ud + d(u).

let e  z and e  z  be vector bundles and  : e  e a linear bundle morphism
over a morphism  : z  z . then every section s of the dual bundle e  z  denes
the pull-back section s of the dual bundle e  z by the law

vzs(z) = (vz)s((z)),

vz  ez.

it follows that a linear bundle morphism  yields a morphism

s : (z, ae)  (z , ae )

(41)

of simple graded manifolds seen as locally ringed spaces [14]. this is the pair (,   )
of the morphism  of the body manifolds and the composition of the pull-back ae   f 7
f  ae of graded functions and the direct image  of the sheaf ae onto z . with
respect to local bases (za, ca) and (za, ca) for (z, ae) and (z , ae ), the morphism (41)
reads

s(z) = (z),

s(ca) = a

b (z)cb.

accordingly, the pull-back onto z of graded exterior forms on z  is dened.

6 susy-extended lagrangian formalism

the susy-extended eld theory is constructed as the brs-generalization of the vertical
extension of eld theory on the bre bundle v y  x in section 4.

let us consider the vertical tangent bundle v v y  v y of v y  x and the simple
graded manifold (v y, av v y ) whose body manifold is v y and the characteristic vector
bundle is v v y  v y . its local basis is (x, yi, yi, ci, ci) where {ci, ci} is the bre basis for
v v y , dual of the holonomic bre basis {i, i} for v v y  v y . graded vector elds
and graded exterior 1-forms are introduced on v y as sections of the vector bundles vv v y
and v 
v v y . by
the brs operator on graded functions on v y is meant the complex graded vector eld
uq (10). it satises the nilpotency rule u2

v v y , respectively. let us complexify these bundles as c 
x

vv v y and c 
x

v 

q = 0.

the conguration space of the susy-extended eld theory is the simple graded ma-
nifold (v j 1y, av v j 1y ) whose characteristic vector bundle is the vertical tangent bun-
dle v v j 1y  v j 1y of v j 1y  x.
), where

for v v j 1y  v j 1y . the ane bration 1
0 : v j 1y  v y and the corresponding ver-
tical tangent morphism v 1
0 : v v j 1y  v v y yields the associated morphism of graded
manifolds (v j 1y, av v j 1y )  (v y, av v y ) (41).

} is the bre basis for v v j 1y dual of the holonomic bre basis {i, i, 

its local basis is (x, yi, yi

, ci, ci, ci

let us introduce the operator of the total derivative


ci + ci
with this operator, the coordinate transformation laws of ci

d =  + yi

 read

ci

ci

(42)

then one can treat ci
 as the jets of ci and ci. note that this is not the notion of
jets of graded bundles in [19]. the transformation laws (42) show that the brs operator
uq (10) on v y can give rise to the complex graded vector eld

in a similar way, the simple graded manifold with the characteristic vector bundle

(44)

as in the brs mechanics [1-4], the main criterion of the susy extension of lagran-
gian formalism is its invariance under the brs transformation (43). the brs-invariant
extension of the vertical lagrangian lv (21) is the graded n-form

ls = lv + iccl

(45)

such that lj uqls = 0. the corresponding eulerlagrange equations are dened as the
kernel of the eulerlagrange operator

els = (dyii + d yi i + dci 

ci + dci 

ci )ls  .

they read

ils = il = 0,
ils = ilv + iccil = 0,

ci ls = icil = 0,

ci ls = icil = 0,

(46a)
(46b)

(46c)

(46d)

where the relations (44) are used. the equations (46a) are the eulerlagrange equations
for the initial lagrangian l, while (46b) - (46d) can be seen as the equations for a jacobi
eld yi = ci + ci + i yi modulo terms of order > 2 in the odd parameters  and .

7 susy-extended hamiltonian formalism

a momentum phase space of the susy-extended eld theory is the complexied simple
graded manifold (v , av v ) whose characteristic vector bundle is v v   v  [12]. its
local basis is

(x, yi, p

i , yi, p

i , ci, ci, c

14

i and c

i have the same transformation laws as p

where c

corresponding graded vector elds and graded 1-forms are introduced on v  as sections
of the vector bundles c

vv v  and c

in accordance with the above mentioned transformation laws of c

i and c

i , the brs

operator uq (10) on v y can give rise to the complex graded vector eld

euq = c + i yi

on v . the brs-invariant extension of the polysymplectic form v y (25) on v  is the

where (ci, ic
i ) are the conjugate pairs. let  be a hamiltonian connection
for a hamiltonian form h on . its double vertical prolongation v v  on v v   x
is a linear morphism over the vertical connection v  on v   x, and so denes the
composite graded connection

(v v )s = v  + dx  [gi

this composite graded connection satises the relation

(v v )ss = dhs,

and can be regarded as a hamiltonian graded connection for the hamiltonian graded form

i dyi + p

hs = [ p
hs = (v + icc)h,

i d yi + i(c

(48)

thus, it is the desired susy extension of the hamiltonian form h.

on v . it is readily observed that this graded form is brs-invariant, i.e., leuqhs = 0.

the hamiltonian graded form hs (48) denes the corresponding susy extension of
the lagrangian lh (16) as follows. the bration j 1v   v  yields the pull-back of the

15

hamiltonian graded form hs (48) onto j 1v . let us consider the graded generalization
of the operator h0 (12) such that

h0 : dci 7 ci

let us study the relationship between susy-extended lagrangian and hamiltonian

formalisms. given a lagrangian l on j 1y , the vertical legendre map blv (23) yields the

corresponding morphism (41) of graded manifolds

which is given by the relations (24) and

sblv : (v j 1y, av v j 1y )  (v , av v )

let h be a hamiltonian form on . the vertical hamiltonian map chv (29) yields the

morphism of graded manifolds

given by the relations (30) and

schv : (v , av v )  (v j 1y, av v j 1y )

ci

ci

16

if a hamiltonian form h is associated with l, a direct computation shows that the
hamiltonian graded form hs (48) is weakly associated with the lagrangian ls (45), i.e.,

sblv  schv  sblv = sblv ,
ls  schv = (p

where the second equality takes place at points of the lagrangian constraint space bl(j 1y ).

8 the brs-invariance

now turn to the above mentioned case of bre bundles y  x with ane transition
functions. since transition functions of the holonomic coordinates yi on v y are indepen-
dent of yi, the transformation laws of the frames {i} and { i} are the same, and so are
the transformations laws of the coframes {ci} and {ci}. then the graded vector elds
(11) are globally dened on v y . the graded vector elds (10) and (11) constitute the
above-mentioned lie superalgebra of the supergroup isp(2):

[uq, uq] = [uq, uq] = [uq, uq] = [uk, uq] = [uk, uq] = 0,
[uk, uq] = uq,
[uc, uk] = 2uk,

[uk, uq] = uq,
[uc, uk] = 2uk.

[uk, uk] = uc,

(51)

similarly to (43), let us consider the jet prolongation of the graded vector elds (11)

onto v j 1y . using the compact notation u = uaa, we have the formula

and, as a consequence, obtain

ju = u + dua
a

juq = uq + ci

(52)

it is readily observed that the susy-extended lagrangian ls (45) is invariant under the
transformations (52). the graded vector elds (43) and (52) make up the lie superalgebra
(51).

a direct computation shows that the brs-extended hamiltonian form hs (48) is invariant
under the transformations (53). accordingly, the lagrangian lsh (49) is invariant under

(53) make up the lie superalgebra (51).

with the graded vector elds (47) and (53), one can construct the corresponding

the jet prolongation jeu of the graded vector elds (53). the graded vector elds (47) and
graded currents ju = euhs = uhs. these are the graded (n  1)-forms

i ci, k = ic

i ci, c = i(cici  cici)

on v . they form the lie superalgebra (51) with respect to the product

[ju, ju] = j[u,u].

the following construction is similar to that in the susy and brs mechanics. given

a function f on the legendre bundle , let us consider the operators

f = ef euq  ef = euq  cf, f  = ef euq  ef = euq + cf,

called the susy charges, which act on graded functions on v . these operators are
nilpotent, i.e.,

 > 0,

by the brs-invariant extension of a function f is meant the graded function

f  f = 0,

f   f  = 0.

(54)

fs = 

i


(f   f + f  f ).

18

we have the relations

f  fs  fs  f = 0,

f   fs  fs  f  = 0.

these relations together with the relations (54) provide the operators f, f , and fs
with the structure of the lie superalgebra sl(1/1) [20]. in particular, let f be a local
function h in the expression (4). then

hs = i(f 1  f1 + f1  f 1)

is exactly the local function hs in the expression (48). the similar splitting of a super-
hamiltonian is the corner stone of the susy mechanics [21, 22].
