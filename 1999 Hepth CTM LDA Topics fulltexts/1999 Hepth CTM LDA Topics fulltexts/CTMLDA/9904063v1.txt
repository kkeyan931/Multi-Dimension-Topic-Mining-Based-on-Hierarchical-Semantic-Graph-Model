abstract

m-theory has dierent global supersymmetry structures in its various dual incarnations,
as characterized by the m-algebra in 11d, the type iia, type-iib, heterotic, type-i extended
supersymmetries in 10d, and non-abelian supersymmetries in the adsn sm backgrounds. we
show that all of these supersymmetries are unied within the supersymmetry osp(1/64), thus
hinting that the overall global spacetime symmetry of m-theory is osp(1/64). we suggest that
the larger symmetries contained within osp(1/64) which go beyond the familiar symmetries,
are non-linearly realized hidden symmetries of m-theory. these can be made manifest by
lifting 11d m-theory to the formalism of two-time physics in 13d by adding gauge degrees
of freedom. we illustrate this idea by constructing a toy m-model on the worldline in 13d
with manifest osp(1/64) global supersymmetry, and a number of new local symmetries that
remove ghosts. some of the local symmetries are bosonic cousins of kappa supersymmetries.
the model contains 0-superbrane and p-forms (for p=3,6) as degrees of freedom. the gauge
symmetries can be xed in various ways to come down to a one time physics model in 11d,
10d, adsn  sm, etc., such that the linearly realized part of osp(1/64) is the global symmetry
of the various dual sectors of m-theory.

1 perspective on hidden symmetries

m-theory is dened in 11 dimensions, with one time and ten space coordinates.
it has an
extended global supersymmetry characterized by 32 supercharges q and 528 abelian bosonic
charges that include the momentum p, the two-brane charge z and the ve-brane charge
z15 [1]-[7]

{q, q} = 

p + 

z + 15



z15 .

(1)

the charges p, z, z15 commute among themselves and with q. in addition, the 11-
dimensional so(10, 1) lorentz generator j has non-trivial commutation rules with q, p,
z, z15 that correspond to the classication of these charges as spinor, 1-form, 2-form,
5-form respectively in 11-dimensions. we refer to the algebra satised by j, q, p, z,
z15 as the m-algebra.

it is well known that physical input in four dimensions, such as the absence of massless
interacting particles with spin higher than two, constrains the maximum number of supersym-
metries to 32 [8]. this refers to the maximum number of q that commute with the momentum
operators p, as is the case in the m-algebra. however, there is no physical restriction on the
number of non-linearly realized supersymmetries that do not commute with p . in particular,
it is possible to have supersymmetries that do not commute with the hamiltonian or p , while
being supersymmetries of the action. for example, this is the case with the well known special
superconformal symmetry generated by the fermions s in any superconformal theory in any
dimension. in addition, it has been discovered recently that very simple familiar systems have
previously unnoticed hidden symmetries of the type so(d, 2), that are not symmetries of the
hamiltonian [9] [10] but are symmetries of the action. such symmetries are made manifest
by lifting the system to the formalism of two-time physics by the addition of gauge degrees of
freedom together with new gauge symmetries [9] [10].

in this paper we provide arguments that the supersymmetries of the dierent dual versions
of m-theory are all unied within osp(1/64), with 64 supercharges. we will show that the
m-algebra is a subalgebra of osp(1/64) without any contractions. the extra 32 supercharges
do not commute with p  within osp (1/64). we suggest they are symmetries of the action
of m-theory. the symmetry structures that emerge in this way suggest that m-theory could
admit a two-time physics formulation with a total of 13 dimensions.

there has been a number of hints that m-theory may contain various two-time structures
[11],[2],[12]-[20]. in this paper we will show a new embedding of the symmetries of m-theory
in a higher structure suggested by the formalism of two-time physics. we show that when the
m-algebra is extended by adding the 11d conformal generator k , the closure requires the full
osp(1/64). duality and 11d covariance suggest that k  is a hidden symmetry in m-theory.
the point is that the 10d covariant type-iib superalgebra, as well as heterotic and type i
superalgebras can be obtained from the same osp(1/64) , and the 10d type-iia superalgebra

2

is just the dimensional reduction of the m-theory algebra. while k  is non-linearly realized
and remains hidden in the 11d version of m-theory, some of its components are linearly
realized in a dual version of m-theory, so k  is actually present non-perturbatively. a further
clue is the presence of conformal symmetry in some corners of m-theory as noted through the
cft-ads correspondance [21]-[24].

these points will be illustrated in a specic toy m-model [25] with a worldline action that
includes 13d p-form degrees of freedom a m1 mp ( ) for p = 3, 6 in addition to the zero brane
degrees of freedom x m ( ), p m ( ),   ( ) that normally exist in a worldline formalism [10].
the model introduces new concepts of local symmetries, including one that is a bosonic cousin
of kappa supersymmetry. various gauge choices can be found to yield the m-algebra in 11d,
the type iia, type-iib, heterotic, type-i extended supersymmetries in 10d, and non-abelian
superalgebras in the adsn  sm backgrounds. thus, the symmetries of dierent corners of the
moduli space of m-theory emerge as dierent gauge choices in this model [25].

2 subgroup chains

we rst show that the m-algebra is contained in osp(1/64). the supergroup osp(1/64) has
64 fermionic generators q  and 2080 bosonic generators s   that form a 6464 symmetric
matrix. the lie superalgebra is

nq , q o = s  ,
hs  , qi = c q  + c q 
hs  , s i = c s   + c s  + c s  + c s 

the s   form the lie algebra of sp(64) and the constant antisymmetric matrix c   is the
metric of sp(64). a matrix representation of osp(1/64) is given by 6565 supermatrices. we
are interested in re-expressing these generators in various bases, that are related to the basis
above by unitary transformations, such that various spacetime interpretations can be given to
those bases. for this purpose several branchings of sp(64) will be used :

a : sp (64)  su  (32)  so (1, 1)

 sp (32)  so (1, 1)  so (10, 2)  so (1, 1)    

b : sp (64)  so (32)  so (2, 1)

 su  (16)  u (1)  so (2, 1)

 so (9, 1)  so (2, 1)  u (1)    

c : sp (64)  so (11, 2)

the (*) indicates an appropriate analytic continuation that contains the non-compact groups
listed. there is another chain of interest that involves a supergroup that will come up in our

discussion (we are not listing a complete set of branchings).

we list the rst step of the decomposition of the 642080 representations for the a,b,c
branches. for the a-branch we have the su  (32)  so (1, 1) representations

64 = 321/2  321/2,

where the superscripts correspond to the so(1, 1) charge, and subscripts indicate the prod-
ucts of the supercharges that produce those representations (s and a stand for symmetric
and antisymmetric product respectively). for the b-branch we have the so (32)  so (2, 1)
representations

64 = (32, 2) ,

2080 = (cid:16)1(3232)s, 3(22)s(cid:17)  (cid:16)527(3232)s, 3(22)s(cid:17)  (cid:16)496(3232)a

, 1(22)a(cid:17) .

for the c-branch we have the so (11, 2) representations

64 = 64,

2080 = 78 ( j2)  286 ( j3)  1716 ( j6)

(8)

(9)

(10)

where the j m n , j m1 m2 m3, j m1 m6 are p-forms in 13d. the jp can be represented by p-
products of 13d 6464 gamma matrices. for p = 2, 3, 6 these are 6464 symmetric matrices
that represent the 2080 components of s   in a 13d spinor basis. the a,b,c branches in this
paper are related to the a,b,c branches discussed in s-theory [13]. the c branch provides a
so(11, 2) covariant 13d interpretation for m-theory as we will see with an explicit toy m-model.

3 11d and 12d interpretations

if so(11, 2) of the c-branch is interpreted as the conformal group in 11-dimensions then one may
re-classify all the generators as representations of the lorentz subgroups so(10, 1)  so (1, 1)
in 11-dimensions and 2-dimensions contained in 13d. to do so, re-label the 13 dimensions with
two sets, one in 10+1 and the other in 1+1 dimensions, m =   m where  = 0, 1,    , 10
and m = (+, ), with the metric in the extra two dimensions taken in a lightcone type basis
+ = 1. this conformal basis emerges naturally as one of the gauge choices in two-time
physics [9] [10] [25] as will be discussed later in this paper. the 64-spinor may be re-labelled as
q   q1/2
2 denoting the two chiral spinors
in 2d. then the generators j m n of the conformal group are identied as j -so(10, 1) lorentz
transformations, j +  p  -translations, j   k  -special conformal transformations, and

the dimensions d = 1,  1
2 , 0 provide a 5-grading of the superalgebra such that under the
commutation rules the dimensions add [xd1, xd2}  xd1+d2. if d1 + d2 is not one of the
dimensions listed, the result of the commutator is zero. then we see that the d  0 operators
j , q1/2
 , p , z , z 15, form the m-algebra: the anti-commutator {q, q} contains only
the 528 generators p , z , z 15 (d=1) which commute among themselves and with q1/2
(d=1/2), while j  (d=0) generates the lorentz transformations so(10, 1). hence, the 11d
m-algebra is contained in osp(1/64) as a subalgebra without considering any contractions!



osp(1/64) is the smallest simple supergroup that includes the m-algebra as a sub-algebra
without resorting to contractions. as argued above, if the special conformal generator k  is
also included along with the m-algebra, then all other generators of osp(1/64) must also be
included for consistency with the 5-grading and jacobi identities. thus, conformal symmetry
in 11d together with the m-algebra demand osp(1/64).

the 11d interpretation ts into the higher algebraic structures contained in the a-branch
(2). the spinor decomposes as 64=321/2  321/2 under su (32)  so (1, 1). each 32-spinor
corresponds to the fundamental representation of sp (32) su (32) and furthermore they
are classied as real weyl spinors of so(10, 2) of same chirality. this classication denes
the a-envelop of the 5-graded 11d superconformal algebra described above such that 11d is
embedded in 12d. one may then combine the 11d operators j  j into a 12d generator
jm n , and the 5-form j15 may be written as a 6-form jm1m6 that is self-dual in 12d. the
jm n form the so(10, 2) subgroup listed in the a-branch, and together with the jm1m6 they
make up the 528-adjoint of sp(32). similarly, the remaining operators make up complete 12d
representations, such as p1  z2 = zm n and z5 = z +
m1m6 and j3  j4 = jm1m4, etc. finally
all of these are put together as su (32)  so (1, 1) representations as in the rst step of the
a-branch in (6-7). this shows that the operators jm n , zm n , z +
m1m6, q which form a 12d
envelop for the m-algebra, as used in several applications of s-theory, also t in the two-time
formalism given in this paper.

4 type-iia, iib, heterotic, type-i interpretations

the 10d type-iia version follows from re-classifying the 11d basis of (11-15) under so(9, 1) of
10d. the 32-spinor supercharge q1/2
in 11d becomes the two opposite chirality supercharges
16+16 of type iia. similarly the 32-spinor of special superconformal generator s1/2
becomes
the two opposite chirality special superconformal supercharges 16+16 of type iia. the 11d
m-algebra is rewritten trivially in 10d in the type iia basis.





in the c/b-branch, the type-iib version follows from re-classifying the 64-spinor of 13d as
the spinorspinor of 10d3d, namely q  = qa s a where ,  denote the real spinors 16,16
of so(9, 1) and a denotes the doublet spinor of so(2, 1). both sets of spinors qa, s a are real,
and there is no relation between them via hermitian conjugation. the qa play the role of the
two 10d supersymmetry generators of type iib, while the two s a play the role of the two 10d
special superconformal generators of type iib. similarly the vector of so(11, 2) is decomposed
by using m =  + m with  = 0, 1,    , 9 and m = +, , 2. the m =  components are the
same as the  components used to reduce 13d to 11d, and the 2 component is a re-naming of
the 11th dimension in so(10, 1). the anti-commutators in the superalgebra take the sketchy
form

the so(9, 1) generators are j1 2 and the so(2, 1) generators are d mn. the operators
labelled with m are triplets of so(2, 1) while the others are singlets. the singlet operator  is
written in terms of the 13d operators as  = j +2. its commutation rules with the 64 spinors
q  is [, q ]  (cid:16)+2q(cid:17)
. since one may write +2= 019 for 6464 gamma matrices
[13], the operator  acts like the chirality operator on the 10d spinors qa, s a. therefore

the bosonic generators p 1

z q
p that correspond to p-forms in 10d and q-forms in 3d respectively. so the commutation rules
for osp(1/64) may be written in a graded chirality basis in the form [x1, x2} = x1+2. if
the chirality 1 + 2 does not exist the result of the commutator is zero. the   0 operators
j2, d2, , qa, p 1
5 , z3
commute with each other as well as with qa, while the so(9, 1) so(2, 1) u(1) subgroup,
consisting of j2, d2, , map the operators qa, p 1

we have established that the b-algebra, that is essential for understanding m-theory in a
iib basis, is included in osp(1/64) as a subalgebra without any contractions. furthermore,
since it ts into the c-branch it is consistent with the so(11, 2) symmetry of two-time physics
and the idea that the 10d+3d basis is arrived at as a gauge choice in two-time physics. indeed
this is true in the toy m-model discussed later.

these c-branch 13d=10d+3d results intersect the b-branch 10d+3d basis as can be
seen by the following larger classication under the b-branch (3) that include the envelops

the products of so(9, 1)  so(2, 1) spinor representations q = (16, 2) and s = (cid:16)16, 2(cid:17) that
produce the various 10d and 3d forms are indicted. the su (16)  u (1) subgroup of so (32)
is generated by (j2  x4)  . the forms in independent parentheses (  ) correspond to
irreducible representations under su (16)  so (2, 1)  u (1). their collection in each line
correspond to so (32)  so (2, 1) representations as given in (9). the 496 is the adjoint
representation of so (32) and the 527 is the symmetric traceless tensor of so (32). these
2080 generators form the algebra of sp(64).

it was shown in [26] that the b-algebra may be written in an sl(2, z) (u-duality) basis
instead of the spacetime so(2, 1) =sl(2, r) basis given above. these two bases are related

7

to each other by a deformation that involves the iib string coupling constant z = a + ie
(axion and dilaton moduli), and its sl(2, z) properties z = (az + b) / (cz + d). the deformed
b-algebra may be used to perform certain non-perturbative computations at any value of the
string coupling constant (see [26]). the entire superalgebra osp(1/64) may be rewritten in the
sl(2, z) basis by following the prescription in [26]. therefore the observations in s-theory in a
iib basis may now be interpreted as observations in the two-time physics version of m-theory
taken in a particular gauge.

the 10d a and b bases are obviously related to each other since they both occur in the
c-branch. the map between these two corresponds to a rearrangement of the 64 fermions
that are in the spinor representation of so(11, 2). this map is clearly related to t-duality as
discussed in [13], and in the present context of two-time physics it is interpreted as just a gauge
transformation from one xed gauge to another xed gauge.

the heterotic and type-i superalgebras in 10d are then obtained as in [13] from the iib
sector, either by setting one of the two 16-supercharges qa to zero (heterotic) or by their
identication (type i). this is possible because one can work in a osp(1/64) representation
space labelled by the commuting operators p m
15  z1 2 3. the heterotic or type-i
sectors may be viewed as bps-like sectors in which some of these charges are related to each
other as discussed in the second paper in [13].

5 adsn  sm bases

in the c-branch, starting with so(11, 2) one can come down to the basis labelled by the
subgroups so(3, 2) so(8) or to so(6, 2) so(5) , which are the isometries of the spaces
ads4s7 and ads7s4 respectively. the reduction is obtained by rewriting the 13d label
m =   m, where , m are labels for the vectors of so(3, 2) ,so(8) or so(5) ,so(6, 2). also,
the 64-spinor is rewritten in 32+32 form q  = +
 a. each 32=48 since  denotes the 4-
spinor for sp(4)  so (3, 2) or so(5) , and a, a denote the two spinors 8 for so(8) or so(6, 2).
for so(3, 2) so(8) both +
 a are real since the corresponding spinors are real. hence,
they each have 32 real and independent components. for so(5) so(6, 2) they are in a complex
basis since the 4 and the 8 are pseudo-real. however, the pseudo-reality condition still gives
32 real and independent components in each of the +
 a. the anti-commutators in the

osp(8/4) or osp(6, 2/4) ? these are not sub-supergroups of osp(1/64). from our analysis
it can be seen that osp(8/4) or osp(6, 2/4) , which includes +
+, gets enlarged by
the addition of the non-abelian operators x +2
into osp(1/32)+ (it is not possible to set
these operators to zero naively since they are non-abelian and they cannot be simultaneously
diagonalized in a quantum theory). in turn, osp(1/32)+ is the sector of osp(1/64) that is a
singlet under sp(32).

we speculate that if the cft-ads conjecture [21] corresponds to a corner of m-theory then
the enlargement of the superalgebra probably does occur on the cft side from the point of
view of the n=8 super yang-mills theory in 3d. the symmetry of this theory in perturbation
theory to all orders is osp(8/4). as shown in [10], by taking the so(3, 2) indices  = , 
and +
, the conformal supersymmetry of the ads4  s7 background can be
rewritten in the compact form of eq.(32), excluding the x +2
generators. how can
one see the enlargement to osp(1/32)+? one begins with non-perturbative eld congurations
that turn on the central extensions nq1/2
=+; then the conformal symmetry k
requires all x + mn
, thus completing
the osp(1/32)+ superalgebra of eq.(32). this argument shows that the inclusion of non-
perturbative physics in the ads4s7 background could be described by the sp(32)-singlet
sector of osp(1/64). the singlet sector can arise as a result of a contraction that would be
related to the limits [21] one must take to establish the ads-cft correspondance.

similarly, in the c-branch, starting with so(11, 2) we can come down to a 12d basis by
separating the 13th spacelike dimension m = m  1. this gives 64=32l + 32r where 32l,r
are the two so (10, 2) spinors l, r of opposite chirality (contrast 12d to the 12d of the
a-branch which gave same chirality). next we separate 12d=6d+6d so that so (10, 2) 
so (6, 2)  so (6) which is the isometry group of the ads5  s5 space. consider the 32l real
components l
a written in the (4, 4) complex spinor basis with  and a denoting the complex 4
spinors of su(2, 2) = so (4, 2) and su(4) = so (6) respectively. since the basis is complex we
a (cid:17)
need to consider the hermitian conjugates (cid:16)l,r
 a where  and a denote the complex
4 spinors. then the 12d basis of osp(1/64) is reduced to the 6d+6d basis and it takes the
following sketchy form

so (10, 2). the supersymmetry algebra in this background is su(2, 2/4). what is the relation
of osp(1/64) and su(2, 2/4)? as before, this is not a sub-supergroup. again, upon the
inclusion of the charges jl  x l2
it can be seen that su(2, 2/4) is enlarged into
osp(1/32)l as in the rst two lines of the equations above (see also [27] [28]). then we see that
su(1/64)  osp(1/32)l  sp (32)r and the sector that is singlet under sp (32)r is described
by osp(1/32)l.

1 . conformal symmetry requires the full z l1

if one starts with the superconformal n=4 super yang-mills theory in 4d, the perturbative
symmetry is su(2, 2/4). by including central extensions that correspond to non-perturbative
backgrounds such as monopoles and dyons one turns on the central charge z l m
+ which is part
of z l1
. their
commutators generate all the other remaining charges to complete the osp(1/32)l superal-
gebra. thus the inclusion of non-perturbative physics in the ads5s5 background could be
described by the sp(32)r-singlet sector of osp(1/64). the singlet sector can arise as a result
of a contraction that may be related to the limits [21] one must take to establish the ads-cft
correspondance.

6 toy m-model, cousins of kappa symmetry

our ideas can be dynamically illustrated with a toy m-model on the worldline with a new set of
gauge symmetries. the main point is that in this model the various dual bases described above
emerge naturally by making appropriate gauge choices within the same theory. conversely, one
can transform one basis to another dual basis by making gauge transformations, thus imitating
duality in m-theory. here we only outline the general structure of such a model, leaving the
details to a future paper [25]. similar structures could be constructed for any group g and a
choice of subgroup h as outlined at the end of [10].

consider the supergroup g =osp(1/64) with the subgroup h =so(11, 2). let x m
i =
(x m , p m ) represent position / momentum so(11, 2) vectors. the 0-brane vectors x m
( )
i
form an sp(2) doublet. sp(2) is gauged by including the gauge potentials aij ( ). this

10

gauge symmetry introduces rst class constraints whose solution requires two-timelike dimen-
sions as explained in [9].
in addition, consider the 6565 matrix which is a group element
g ( ) osp(1/64). it is a singlet under sp(2). the subgroup h =so(11, 2) acting simultane-
is gauged. the gauge potential is  m n ( ).
ously on the left side of g and on the vectors x m
i
with this information we can write covariant derivatives as in [10]

this action is invariant under the global symmetry osp(1/64) that acts linearly on the right
side of g ( ). on the left side of g ( ) the evident symmetry is smaller h=so(11, 2) because
of the presence of , but as we will see there is a much bigger local symmetry that is realized
non-linearly. thus the model is realized in the c-branch osp(1/64). as we saw above, the
c-branch contains all the interesting spacetime interpretations at its intersections with the a
and b branches and with the osp(1/32) branch.

the group element g ( ) can be written in the form g = ht where h  h and t  g/h. we
can use the h = so (11, 2) gauge symmetry to choose a unitary gauge by eating away h ( ).
using the equations of motion (or doing the path integral) one may solve for  m n =  m n +l m n
, with  m n = 1

a m1 m6 ( ) degrees of freedom that correspond to 13d p-forms with p=3,6. as described in [10],
the global symmetry g osp(1/64) acts on the right side of t ( ) and it must be compensated
by a eld dependent, gauge restoring transformation h1 (a, ; g) on the left side

t (a, )  t (a, ) = h1t (a, ) g .

(46)

h ( ) acts as a eld dependent so(11, 2) gauge transformation on  m n (a, ) and x m
. the
i
action remains invariant because it was built as a gauge invariant under so(11, 2) and globally
invariant under osp(1/64).

i

the action in this gauge involves the following elds on the worldline x m
i

( ) , aij ( ) ,
a3 ( ) , a6 ( ) ,  ( ). the x m
( ) ,   ( ) may be interpreted as the 13d superspace of two-
time physics as in [10], however the bigger dimensions in the present case, as opposed to the
3,4,6d cases of [10], require the extra bosonic degrees of freedom a3, a6. from the superalgebra
point of view these are closely associated with the p-brane charges j3, j6 of the c-branch, hence
the ap may be thought of as the  -component of (p + 1)-form gauge potentials ap+1 for p = 3, 6.
there is also additional local symmetry beyond so(11, 2) that originates with transforma-
tions on the left side of t (a, ) with fermionic as well as bosonic parameters b3( ), b6 ( ) ,   ( )
that form a generalization of kappa supersymmetry. the transformation is

t (a, )  t (cid:16)a



, 

(cid:17) = h1t (b, ) t (a, ) ,

(47)

where again h (b, ; a, ) is the induced local lorentz transformation. for innitesimal b, 
we have t = 165 + b33 + b66 +  f  where 3,6 and f  are 6565 matrices that provide
representations of the generators of g/h. then we nd that the lagrangian is invariant under
these additional gauge symmetries provided the parameters , b3, b6 are constrained by the
following relations (where  xi  xj means proportional up to eld dependent functions with
appropriate indices)

l m n (cid:16) m n (cid:17) 

 l n
[ m1

b m2 m3] n  l n
[ m1

b m2 m6] n  xi  xj.

(48)

the left side looks like lorentz transformations on , b3, b6 with a lorentz parameter l m n .
then the part proportional to xi  xj is cancelled by choosing aij so that  is invariant (see
[10] for an explicit example). these gauge symmetries are more than sucient to remove the
ghosts in , a3, a6 associated with the extra timelike dimension in 13d. we will call these gauge
symmetries extended kappa symmetries.

we may now make various gauge choices for sp(2) , so(11, 2), and extended kappa sym-
metries, that are manifestly covariant under various spacetime interpretations (one-time) as
discussed in the purely algebraic discussion in the rst part of this paper. to do this we reor-
ganize the degrees of freedom x m
( ) , a3 ( ) , a6 ( ) ,   ( ) according to the representations
i
of the various subgroups of so(11, 2) as we did for the generators of osp(1/64). some of the
pieces of xi, a3, a6,  are set to zero or constants by gauge xing. then part of osp(1/64) is
realized linearly on the remaining degrees of freedom and the remainder is realized non-linearly.
for such examples in simpler cases without supersymmetry see [9] and with supersymmetry see
[10]. this discussion makes it evident that we can choose gauges that would realize the 11d
m-algebra, the 10d type iia, type iib, heterotic, type-i supersymmetries, or the superalge-
bras describing the adsn  sm backgrounds. these gauge choices provide dierent looking toy

12

models that have the supersymmetries of the various corners of the moduli space of m-theory
[25]. since they are all derived from the same unied 13d theory by gauge choices, they can be
transformed into each other by gauge transformations that correspond to dualities in m-theory.
the toy m-model given here has a much richer set of possible gauge choices along the lines of
[9] that tie together systems such as free particles, hydrogen atom, harmonic oscillators, curved
spaces, and even non-relativistic systems with more general potentials, etc. this suggests that
m-theory may have similar properties. it appears that m-theory could be lifted to two-time
physics with a global symmetry osp(1/64). we are hopeful that m-theory will be better
understood by studying it covariantly in 13d in the formalism of two-time physics in the
presence of various gauge degrees of freedom and new gauge symmetries of the type described
here.
