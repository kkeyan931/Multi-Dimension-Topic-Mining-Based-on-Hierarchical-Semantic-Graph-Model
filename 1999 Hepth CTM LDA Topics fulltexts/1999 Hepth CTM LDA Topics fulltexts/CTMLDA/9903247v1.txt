abstract

the path-integral of the fermionic oscillator with a time-dependent frequency is ana-
lyzed. we give the exact relation between the boundary condition to dene the domain in
which the path-integral is performed and the transition amplitude that the path-integral
calculates. according to this relation, the amplitude suppressed by a zero mode does not
indicate any special dynamics, unlike the analogous situation in eld theories. it simply
says the path-integral picks up a combination of the amplitudes that vanishes. the zero
mode that is often neglected in the reason of not being normalizable is necessary to obtain
the correct answer for the propagator and to avoid an anomaly on the fermion number.
we give a method to obtain the fermionic determinant by the determinant of a simple
2  2 matrix, which enables us to calculate it for a variety of boundary conditions.

fermionic determinant of the operator d is the one we rst encounter in the analysis of
the quantum physics in the path-integral formalism. it is the exact result of the grassmann
path-integral made from a bilinear lagrangian d over the fermionic degrees of freedom 
and . the determinant carries an important information about the time evolution of the
fermions under the inuence of bosonic background. especially when d or its adjoint d
has a zero mode, the zero-frequency eigenmode of the operator, the determinant vanishes and
corresponding transition is suppressed. a typical example of such situation happens with d the
dirac operator in su(2) gauge theory. it possesses zero modes in the instanton background. the

consequent suppression of the transition is interpreted to reect the fermion number violation
due to the anomaly on the fermion current [1].

in spite of the importance of the understandings about the role of zero modes in path-
integral calculation, there seems to be a confusion even in the case of fermionic oscillator,
the simplest system containing only one fermionic degree of freedom. its lagrangian d in
imaginary time formalism is given by a simple rst order dierential operator

d =

d
d

+ v( )

(1)

with respect to the imaginary time  , where v( ) is the time-dependent angular frequency
induced by a coupling to a bosonic degree of freedom. we also dene

d = 

d
d

+ v( ).

(2)

assume v( ) change its sign along the evolution in the time interval [0, t ], for example, as
v( ) = tanh(  (t /2)). the solution of d = 0 is then regarded as the zero mode since it
is normalizable in the limit of t  . gildener and patrascioiu have argued by an explicit
calculation that there is no zero mode available in the determinant calculus even in this simple
example [2], while salomonson and van holten have taken advantage of the zero mode in their
calculation for the supersymmetry breaking [3].

in addition to the question of the existence of zero mode, we concern that the fermionic
oscillator would have an anomaly if the numbers of the zero modes of d and d are dierent. in
the simple example mentioned above, the solution of d = 0 is not thought to be the relevant
for suciently large t , it becomes zero almost everywhere when normalized to
zero mode:

one. thus there appears to be the asymmetry in the numbers. according to the path-integral
formulation of the anomaly [4], this asymmetry induces a phase in the path-integral measure
under the global phase transformation,   ei and   ei , which indicates the non-
conservation of the fermion number. this contradicts our naive intuition, that the fermionic
oscillator should have no anomaly since we can calculate any amplitude with no regularization.

in this letter, we will clarify the role of the zero mode in the path-integral of the fermionic os-
cillator. the important observation is that the boundary condition for the domain in which the

zero mode resides is not the anti-periodic one as usually taken, and the path-integral represents
a dierent amplitude if the boundary condition is dierent. we will also show that we cannot
neglect the solution of d = 0 in the example above even though it looks un-normalizable. the
strong tool for the analysis is a formula that connects the fermionic determinant, the innite
product of the eigenvalues of the dierential operator, to the determinant of a 2  2 matrix.
this formula is useful enough to calculate the so-called det , the similar innite product except
zero eigenvalues.

the hamiltonian of the oscillator is

h( ) = v( )

1

2 (cid:16)  (cid:17) ,

(3)

where  and  are the annihilation and creation operators in the two-dimensional space
spanned by vacant |0i and occupied |1i states,

|0i = |1i = 0, |1i = |0i, |0i = |1i.

(4)

2

from this hamiltonian, the evolution operator from the initial time 0 to the nal t is obtained
by

u(t, 0) = t exp"z t

0

dh()# ,

(5)

where t represents the time-ordered product. the hamiltonian commutes with the fermion
number operator , and it is obvious that the matrix elements of u(t, 0) are written as

h0|u(t, 0)|0i = exp" 1

2 z t

0

d v( )# ,

h1|u(t, 0)|1i = exp"

1

2 z t

0

d v( )# ,

(6)

and two o-diagonal ones equal to zero. these are all we have to know to obtain any transition
amplitude. our rst step is to give the exact correspondence of the path-integral to these
matrix elements.

we write the path-integral as

i = z [d d] exp"z t

0

d d# ,

(7)

where the functional measure is dened by the continuum limit of discretized variables [5]. the
most decent way of its calculation for non-hermitian d such as the one in the present case is to
choose the domains d and d of the square-integrable functions in the interval [0, t ], in which
dd and dd are self-adjoint and the non-zero eigenmodes have the one-to-one correspondence
(see for example [4]). the normalized eigenmodes (n)( d) and (n)( d) (n = 1, 2, 3, ....),
(8)

dd(n) = n(n), dd(n) = n(n),

constitute a complete orthonormal set and they are related by

1

nd(n) = (n),

1

nd(n) = (n),

(9)

except zero modes. the eigenvalues so obtained are non negative. using the expansions with

these eigenmodes,

( ) = xn

an(n)( ),

we employ the integration measure [dan dan] instead of [d  d] and obtain

( ) = xn

an(n)( ),

i = n z [dada]epn

nanan = n hdet(dd)i1/2

,

(10)

(11)

where n is the jacobian between the measures, det(dd) is the innite product of the eigen-
values. the latter is well-dened in the combination with n . dierent backgrounds v( ) result

3

in dierent orthonormal sets. each of them is a complete orthonormal set anyway since it con-
sists of the eigenmodes of a self-adjoint operator, and the jacobian between them is one. thus
the jacobian n in (11) is independent of v( ). the procedure described here has a greater
advantage in this property than the direct use of the eigenmodes of non self-adjoint d as was
done in ref. [2]. it is not so clear if the corresponding jacobian is background-independent in
their calculation.

even if the domains d and d satisfy the above-described criterion, they are not unique.

we can say that any 1 and 2 in d obey

1(0)d2(0)  1(t )d2(t ) = 0

(12)

if the domains are properly chosen; d(0), for example, stands for (0)+v(0)(0) (  = d/d ).
eq. (12) states dd in d is symmetric and non-negative, and it is required by the one-to-one
correspondence (9). it is not, however, sucient to dene the domains concretely. we need
to specify two linearly independent boundary conditions on the values and the rst derivatives

of  and  at  = 0 and t . we refer the readers to the mathematical text book [6] about
the self-adjoint extension of the dierential expression dd. what important in the following
discussion is that the dierent boundary conditions lead to the dierent matrix elements of
u(t, 0).

to see the exact relation of the matrix elements and the boundary condition, we recall the
essence of the denition of the path-integral according to ref. [5]. we rst prepare the states

making use of grassmann numbers  and . they satisfy the completeness relation,

|i  |0i + |1i,

h|  h0| + h1|

z dd(1  )|ih| = |0ih0| + |1ih1|.

(13)

(14)

the path-integral in principle calculates hn|u(t, 0)|0i, the evolution from |0i at 0  0 to
hn| at n  t . to evaluate this, we discretize the time interval into n segments, each of
which has the length  = t /n and write u(t, 0) as

u(t, 0) = lim

nt   n
yn=1

(1  h(n))! ,

(15)

where n = n. we insert (n1) pairs of grassmann integrals of (n, n)(n = 1, ..., n1) in the
form of the completeness relation (14) as the (n1) junctions of the n factors (1h(n))(n =
1, ..., n). the result is the denition of (7) when we regard n as (n) and n as (n).

4

what is unclear in this denition is what happened to n and 0. we realize that we have
integrated out these variables on exactly the same footing as the other (n, n)s in the steps to
reach (11). we thus understand the exact denition of the measure [d d] in eq. (7) does in
fact include the integral over n and 0 as

i  z dn dn (1  n n )hn|u(t, 0)|0i

(16)

where 0 and n is related by the boundary condition. the relevant terms in the integrand in
(16) is those quadratic in the grassmann variables,

(1  n n )hn|u(t, 0)|0i = ...  n nh0|u(t, 0)|0i + n 0h1|u(t, 0)|1i + ...

this shows

if the boundary conditions imposed to dene d is 0 + n = 0, or equivalently

i = h0|u(t, 0)|0i + h1|u(t, 0)|1i

(0) + (t ) = 0.

(17)

(18)

(19)

we admit that the jacobian n dened in (11) may depend on the value of  used to dene
the orthonormal basis for  and  and thus an and an in (10). eqs. (18) and (19) include the
common consensus in the special case of  = 1, that is, the fermionic path-integral presents
the trace of u(t, 0) when carried out in the anti-periodic congurations. we need to know the

consequence of the other choice of boundary condition to deal with the zero mode.

before going immediately into the domains including the zero mode, let us start with the

path-integral in the domain dened by the anti-periodic boundary conditions. we reveal a
useful formula for detdd in this pedagogical step. we specify the corresponding domains by
the symbols d and d . d is dened by

while d by

(0) + (t ) = 0, d(0) + d(t ) = 0,

(0) + (t ) = 0, d(0) + d(t ) = 0.

(20)

(21)

note the form we have imposed on the rst derivatives using d and d in (20) to obey (12).
the condition (21) then naturally comes out since eq. (9) requires d to be in d and d in
d . the operators dd and dd are proved to be self-adjoint in these domains, which belongs
to a detail and we will present the proof elsewhere [7].

5

we calculate det(dd)1/2. to this eect, the 2  2 matrix

m(z)    u1(z; 0) + u1(z; t )

du1(z; 0) + du1(z; t ) du2(z; 0) + du2(z; t ) !

u2(z; 0) + u2(z; t )

(22)

plays the central role, where ui(z;  ) (i = 1, 2) are the linearly independent solutions of the
equation

and the parameter z is complex in general. we x the normalization of these solutions by

ddui(z;  ) = zui(z;  )

u1(z; 0) = 1

u2(z; 0) = 0

u1(z; 0) = 0

u2(z; 0) = 1.

(23)

(24)

the primary usage of m is to detect the eigenvalues of dd in d :
if  is one of the
eigenvalues, there exists a non-trivial linear combination 1u1(;  ) + 2u2(;  ) that satises
eq. (20); the equation for i turns out to be m()ij j = 0 (i, j = 1, 2) and thus det m(z) is
zero at the eigenvalue .

form this, we nd det m(z) is proportional to det(dd  z). the proof is essentially
the same as the one given in ref. [8] in the calculation of a determinant, but for a dierent
boundary condition. let us consider two dierent operators d1d1 and d2d2 containing dierent
frequencies v1( ) and v2( ), and denote their n-th eigenvalue by 1;n and 2;n, respectively.
correspondingly let m1 and m2 denote the matrix made by (22) and (23) with d1d1 and
d2d2, respectively. the ratio dened by

det(d1d1  z)
det(d2d2  z) 



2;n  z!
yn=1 1;n  z

(25)

has a simple zero at each 1;n and a simple pole at each 2;n as a function of z.
to one as z goes to innity in any direction except along the real positive axis. the ratio
det m1 (z)/ det m2 (z) has poles and zeros at exactly the same z. note further

it goes

det m(z) = u2(z; t ) + u1(z; t ) + [v(t )  v(0)] u2(z; t ) + 2

(26)

by using the condition (24) and the conservation of the wronskian u1 u2  u1u2 = 1. for su-
ciently large |z|, q|z|  |v( )2 v( )|t , the frequency v( ) in (23) becomes negligible. the so-
lutions ui(z;  ) is then well-approximated by their free solutions, and u2(t )  u1(t )  ezt /2.
the rst two terms on the right-hand-side in (26) dominate and det m1 (z)/ det m2 (z) also goes

6

to one in the same limit. these establish that det(dd  z) and det m(z) are proportional
to each other1.

we can now write (11) as

i = n hdet m(0)i1/2

,

(27)

where n  is a nite constant and we have used the symbol i to indicate that it is the path-
integral done in the domains d(). the calculation of det m(0) is elementary. we obtain

u1(0;  ) = x1( ) + v(0)x2( ),

u2(0;  ) = x2( ),

(28)

where

x1( ) = exp(cid:20)z 

0

dv()(cid:21) ,

y1( ) = exp(cid:20)z 

0

dv()(cid:21) ,

x2( ) = x1( )z 

0

putting these solutions into (26), we found

det m(0) = x1(t ) + y1(t ) + 2 = (cid:16)[x1(t )]1/2 + [y1(t )]1/2(cid:17)2

.

this together with (27) agrees with the direct result2

i = h0|u(t, 0)|0i + h1|u(t, 0)|1i = [y1(t )]1/2 + [x1(t )]1/2

d (y1())2 .

(29)

(30)

(31)

obtained from (6), (18) with  = 1, and (29). the constant n  turns out to be one.

we are prepared to go to the domain that explicitly includes zero mode. recall that the
zero mode candidate is x1 or y1 in (29). let us start with assuming that the normalizable one
in the usual sense is x1. we use d0
 for denoting the domain that contains x1 and in which dd
is self-adjoint. in d0
, every element  needs to obey eq. (12) with x1 and with each other. we
thus found the exact boundary conditions are

(0)  y1(t )(t ) = 0, d(0)  x1(t )d(t ) = 0,

(32)

(remember y1 = (x1)1). these two conditions can be proved to dene the self-adjoint extension
of dd as well [7]. now that zero is an eigenvalue, the path-integral is zero. this should be
so. according to (18), (19), and (32), it corresponds to h0|u(t, 0)|0i  y1(t )h1|u(t, 0)|1i,
which is shown to be zero by the results (6) and (29). there is no dynamical reason for

1similar formulae that relate the determinant of dierential operators with that of a matrix have been found

in condensed matter physics [9].

2the extension to the domain by the periodic boundary condition is straightforward. one can use m + given
by a replacement of + with  in the denition of m  (22) to evaluate the fermionic determinant. it results in
the desired result i + = [y1(t )]1/2  [x1(t )]1/2 for the path-integral in this domain.

7

the vanishing path-integral; we have just chosen a vanishing combination accidentally by the
boundary conditions.

we also notice the other zero solution y1 cannot be neglected. the boundary condition
, the domain in which dd is self-adjoint and all non-zero mode have the one-to-one

for d0
correspondence to those in d0

, is given from (32) by

(0)  x1(t )(t ) = 0, d(0)  y1(t )d(t ) = 0.

(33)

the solution y1 satises this condition and thus is a member of the complete orthonormal basis
in d0
. since we can normalize it any way as long as the time interval t is nite, we cannot
nd any legitimate reason to neglect it.

we can conrm the necessity of y1 in the calculation of the propagator. let us dene

f (, )  (  )u(t,  )u(, )u(, 0)

(   )u(t, )u(,  )u(, 0),

and consider its path-integral representation

g(, ) = z [d d] exp"z t

0

d d# ( ) ().

(34)

(35)

the exact relation of g integrated in d0
by applying eq. (18). it is

() to the corresponding matrix element of f is obtained

g(, ) = (  )h0|u(t,  )u(, )u(, 0)|0i

+(   ) y1(t )h1|u(t, )u(,  )u(, 0)|1i.

eqs. (4) and (6) yield

h0|u(t,  )u(, )u(, 0)|0i = y1(t )1/2x1( )y1(),
h1|u(t,  )u(,  )u(, 0)|1i = x1(t )1/2x1( )y1(),

and

g(, ) = y1(t )1/2x1( )y1().

(36)

(37)

(38)

interestingly the nal result does not have any remnant of the time-ordered procedure in (36).

we do the corresponding path-integral (35). the normalized zero modes are

(1)( ) =

x1( )

d x1()2

sz t

, (1)( ) =

y1( )

.

d y1()2

(39)

the grassmann variables a1 and a1 in the expansion (10), the coecients of (1) and (1), do
not appear in the action. only the  and  in the integrand in (35) can supply them, and one
gets

g(, ) = n hdet (dd)i1/2

(1)( )(1)(),

(40)

where det dd is the product of the eigenvalues except zero. we evaluate this det dd. taking
the boundary condition (32) into account, we dene

m 0(z)   

y1(t )du1(z; 0) + du1(z; t ) y1(t )du2(z; 0) + du2(z; t ) ! .
u1(z; 0)  y1(t )u1(z; t )

u2(z; 0)  y1(t )u2(z; t )

then

det m 0(z) = du2(z; t ) + y1(t )2 [u1(z; t )  v(0)u2(z; t )]  2 y1(t ).

(41)

(42)

1 (z)/ det m 0

introducing two dierent frequencies v1 and v2, we can dene, as we did for the anti-periodic
2 (z) and det(d1d1  z)/ det(d2d2  z) that is calculated
domain, the ratios det m 0
in d0
. we assume v1 and v2 give the same value for y1(t ) (see (29)). then the two ratios share
the common properties as before. they have simple zeros or poles at the eigenvalues of d1d1
or d2d2 and go to one as z goes to innity in any direction except along the positive real axis.
we can conclude

n hdet(dd  z)i1/2

= n hdet m 0(z)i1/2

where n is a nite constant to be determined later. thus

n 2 det (dd) = lim
z0

n 2 det m 0(z)

(z)

.

,

(43)

(44)

for the calculation of the right-hand side of this expression, we use the fact that the solutions
ui(z;  )(i = 1, 2) have an expansion around z = 0,

ui(z;  ) = ui(0;  ) + z ui( ) + ...

and the rst order term is given by

ui( ) = z 

0

d [u1(0;  )u2(0; )  u2(0;  )u1(0; )] ui(0; ).

(45)

(46)

since ui(0) =  ui(0) = 0, the expansion (45) satises the initial conditions (24). a straight-
forward calculation shows det m 0(0) = 0 and

lim
z0

det m 0(z)

= y1(t ) "z t

(47)

eqs. (39), (40), (44) and (47) give the correct result (38). n turns out to be one for the specic
m 0(z) dened in (41). we would like to stress that we would have a wrong answer without
(1).

we summarize the results. we have revealed and conrmed the boundary condition de-

pendence of the path-integral. the boundary condition never changes the dynamics of the
fermionic oscillator but aects the relation of the path-integral to the matrix elements of the

time evolution operator. the suppression of the zero mode on the amplitude in the fermionic
oscillator does not have any dynamical reason. we have shown that the fermionic determinant
is given by that of a simple 2  2 matrix for some specic boundary conditions. this calculus
is easily extended to the other choice of boundary conditions. the numbers of the zero mode
belonging to d and d are the same independently of the specic boundary condition to
dene them. this is consistent with the absence of the anomaly in the fermionic oscillator.
