abstract

we discuss the consistency conditions of a novel orientifold projection of type iib

string theory on c2/zn singularities, in which one mods out by the combined action

of world-sheet parity and a geometric operation which exchanges the two complex

planes. the eld theory on the world-volume of d5-brane probes denes a family of

six-dimensional rg xed points, which had been previously constructed using type

iia congurations of ns-branes and d6-branes in the presence of o6-planes. both

constructions are related by a t-duality transforming the set of ns-branes into the

c2/zn singularity. we also construct additional models, where both the standard

and the novel orientifold projections are imposed. they have an interesting relation

with orientifolds of dk singularities, and provide the t-duals of certain type iia

congurations containing both o6- and o8-planes.

1 introduction

one of the most interesting quantum eld theory lessons that we have learned from

string theory is the existence of six-dimensional supersymmetric eld theories with non-

trivial infrared dynamics [1, 2]. we are now familiar with the existence of large families

of interacting superconformal eld theories with (0, 2) and (0, 1) supersymmetry. there

are two approaches which have been extensively used to construct these theories. the

rst is the study of type iib d5-branes at a-d-e singularities [3, 4] and orientifolds
thereof [5, 6, 7] 1. the second is the construction of type iia brane congurations

(in the spirit of [15]) of ns-branes, d6-branes and possibly d8-branes and orientifold
planes [16, 17, 18] 2

there is a close relation between both constructions. in fact, type iia brane con-

gurations where one of the directions (along which the d6-branes have nite extent)

is compact can be t-dualized to a system of d5-branes probing orbifold and orientifold

singularities (see e.g. [20]). this observation has led to a rich interplay between both

approaches. for example, the construction of superconformal eld theories in the type

iib picture in [3, 5, 6, 7] was a source of information in the study of the t-dual type

iia congurations in [17, 18]. on the other hand, some congurations in [17, 18] (those

containing oppositely charged o8-planes) produced new eld theories which required
the existence of new orientifolds of c2/zn. these were constructed in [21] making use

of the information available from the iia construction.

in this paper we continue this program by constructing the type iib orientifolds

associated to yet another set of eld theories constructed in [17, 18]. as we discuss
below, the new orientifold of c2/zn has some unusual and amusing properties 3.

before continuing with our introduction, it will be useful to know more about

the relevant iia brane congurations [17, 18]. we consider a set of n ns-branes

with worldvolume along 012345, several stacks of d6-branes (along 0123456) stretched
between them, and an o6-plane parallel to the d6-branes. the direction x6, along

which the d6-branes have nite extent, is taken compactied on a circle. the eld

theory on the non-compact part of the d6-brane worldvolume has d = 6, n = 1

supersymmetry. this is the six-dimensional version of the four-dimensional models

studied in [22].

as determined in [23] (see also [24] for a worldsheet derivation of this fact) the

1strings in orientifold backgrounds have been studied for instance in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14].
2a third approach, the study of f-theory on elliptically bered singular calabi-yau threefolds [19]

will not be so relevant for our purposes in the present paper.

3several group theoretical features of the corresponding projection were pointed out in [7].

1

rr charge of the o6-plane changes sign whenever it crosses a ns-brane, and the
projection it imposes on the d6-branes changes accordingly 4. therefore, a consistent

conguration is obtained only for an even number of ns-branes. if we place ni d6-
branes in the ith interval between ns-branes, the gauge group is of the form

so(n0)  usp(n1)  . . .  so(nn 2)  usp(nn 1)

(1.1)

the matter content arises from strings stretching betweeen neighbouring d6-branes,

and is of the form

n 1

xi=0

1
2

( i,

i+1)

(1.2)

where the index i is dened mod n, and the 1
hypermultiplets, due to the o6-plane projection.

2 means the matter arises in half-
in brane congurations realising

six-dimensional eld theories, the ns-branes have the same number of non-compact

dimensions as the d6-branes, so their worldvolume elds are dynamical. in our model,

they give rise to n  1 tensor multiplets; an additional tensor multiplet is decoupled

and hence irrelevant.

as discussed in [16, 17, 18], cancellation of charges in the ns-brane worldvolume

imposes a consistency condition on the conguration, which turns out to be equiva-

lent to the cancellation of irreducible gauge anomalies [25] in the six-dimensional eld

theory. in our case, these conditions are satised for

n2i = n + 8

; n2i+1 = n

(1.3)

the residual gauge anomaly, as discussed in [7], is cancelled by a green-schwarz mech-

anism mediated by the tensor multiplets [26].

as mentioned above, upon t-duality along x6 the ns-branes transform, roughly
speaking, into a c2/zn singularity [27], while the d6-branes become a set of d5-branes

sitting at the singularity. the projection imposed by the o6-plane must transform into
an orientifold projection of c2/zn, such that the eld theory (1.1), (1.2) arises on the

worldvolume of the d5-brane probes. also, the n  1 tensor multiplets are expected

to arise from closed string twisted sectors.

the orientifold of c2/zn whose existence is predicted by this argument has a

number of unusual features. for instance, it must exist only for even n. also, the

closed string sector must give rise to one tensor multiplet per twisted sector. this is

4when k d6-branes sit on top of an o6-plane (which carries 4 units of d6-brane charge, as

counted in the double cover) their gauge group is projected down to so(k). when they sit on top of
an o6+ (with charge +4) their gauge group is u sp(k).

2

in sharp contrast with the usual orientifold projection considered in [14, 6, 21], where

invariant elds are combinations of modes appearing in oppositely twisted sectors of the

type iib theory. these orientifolds provide one tensor multiplet and one hypermultiplet

per pair of oppositely twisted sectors. the n  1 tensors in our model suggests that

the required orientifold projection is rather dierent from the familiar one, in that it

must map each twisted sector to itself.

a second interesting fact is that matter arises in half-hypermultiplets. before the

orientifolding, the matter in the worldvolume of d5-branes at a zn orbifold singular-

ity appears in full hypermultiplets, with the two halves being associated to the two
complex planes in c2/zn. in order to obtain half-hypermultiplets after orientifolding,

 must be accompanied by a geometric action  which maps the two complex planes
to each other 5.

finally, the gauge group on the d5-branes suggests the chan-paton matrix as-

sociated to the orientifolds projection contains symmetric and antisymmetric pieces.

this contradicts the usual rule that d-branes of the same dimension suer orientifold

projections of the same kind.

in section 2 we dene the new orientifold projection  of type iib on c2/zn,

and show it has all the features just described. in section 3 we discuss the construction

of models where both the  and the usual  projections are imposed.

2 orientifold construction

here we propose a type iib t-dual realization of the eld theory in the previous
section, in terms of d5-branes probing a new kind of orientifold of c2/zn. as discussed

below, we propose that the orientation reversing element has a geometric action on
the c2/zn, xy = vn , given by x  y, v  v. this action is a symmetry only

when n is even, and involves the exchange of the two complex planes. this choice

can be heuristically motivated by directly t-dualizing the iia model described above.

following [27], upon t-duality the set of n ns-branes becomes a n-centered taub-
nut space, which can be described as xy = vn in suitable complex coordinates, while

the d6-branes transform into d5-brane probes. the directions 89 can be identied
with v. the directions 7 and 6 (the t-dual of 6, with asymptotic radius r6) are
related to x and y in a complicated manner. roughly speaking, for large x and xed
y one has x  ei(x7+ix6
)/r6 . the

)/r6 and for large y at xed x one has y  e(x7+ix6





5orientifold projections involving exchange of complex planes have also appeared in [28, 29] in a

dierent kind of models.

3

t-dual of the o6-plane action is expected to ip the signs of the coordinates 6789,

which is certainly the case for the action proposed above.

this argument should be considered a heuristic motivation. stronger checks will

arise from the detailed discussion of the model. we therefore turn to constructing
the new orientifold of c2/zn and to showing that the world-volume eld theory on

d5-brane probes is the one described in section 1. let us consider type iib theory on
c2/zn, modded out by , where  is world-sheet parity and  acts as

 : z1  z2

,

z2  z1

(2.1)

with z1, z2 parametrizing the two complex planes in c2/zn. consistency requires
()2 to belong to the orbifold group zn. since it acts as zi  zi, this is the case
when n is even, n = 2k. this condition, which agrees with a constraint found in the

t-dual type iia brane conguration, will be reobtained below from a dierent point of

view. the orientifold dened above preserves n = 1 supersymmetry in six dimensions.

2.1 closed string spectrum

as already mentioned, a rst peculiar feature of this orientifold appears in the com-

putation of the closed string twisted sectors.

in order to appreciate this, it will be

convenient to compare the situation with the usual  projection.

in type iib theory on c2/zn, the left and right moving states are labeled, in

the bosonic description, by a vector rk = (r1, r2, r3, r4) belonging to the so(8) weight
i=1 ri =

lattice shifted by the twist vector vk = (k/n, k/n, 0, 0), and constrained by p4

1 mod 2. at the massless level, these states are

the second column gives the representation under the spacetime little group su(2) 

su(2). we obtain one hyper and one tensor multiplet of d = 6 n = 1 supersymmetry

per twisted sector.

in the usual  orientifolds studied in the literature [14], and for generic twisted

sectors (k 6= n/2), the states surviving the projection are

ns  ns :

r  r :

4(1, 1)

(2.4)

notice that invariant combinations are a mixture of states appearing in oppositely

twisted sectors of the type iib theory. the orientifolded model produces one hyper

and one tensor multiplet per such pair of oppositely twisted sectors.

for the k = n/2 twisted sector, which does not mix with any other, the action of 

may be dened with an additional (1) sign [30]. this z2 choice determines the type

of multiplet surviving the projection. one gets a tensor multiplet or a hypermultiplet if

the additional sign is present or not. as discussed in [30], consistent coupling between

closed and open strings implies the following constraint on the d-brane chan-paton

matrices

n/2 = t

n/21



(2.5)

where the positive sign is taken when  includes the additional (1) sign, and the

negative sign is taken otherwise. the two possibilities correspond to d-brane gauge

bundles with or without vector structure [31].

let us now turn to the  orientifold.

it is easy to realize that  invariant

states do not require mixing dierent twisted sectors of the type iib theory. because

of that, for every sector there is a priori a z2 ambiguity in dening the orientifold

action. actually, below we will show that the only consistent possibility is to include

the additional (1) sign in the action of . assuming momentarily this claim, the

resulting invariant states are

ns  ns :

(1, 1)

(1, 3)

(2.6)

we obtain one tensor multiplet per twisted sector. we now show that this choice is

the only consistent one, by using the constraints coming from consistent coupling of
open and closed strings. consider a set of d5-branes at the c2/zn singularity, before

5

the orientifold projection is imposed 7. their chan-paton matrix ,5 has n dierent
eigenvalues si with multiplicities ni. it can be shown that ,5 is block-diagonal (with
ni  ni blocks) in this basis, and therefore k,5 and ,5 commute. the fact that
 acts diagonally on the index i can be derived e.g. by looking at the chern-simons
couplings of open string states and closed string rr modes in the zn orbifold [3]

z tr (k,5i)ck  efi

(2.7)

where ck is a formal sum of the twisted rr forms, and i selects the entries of the
chan-paton matrix corresponding to the ith set of d-branes. since  is a symmetry of

the orbifold theory, the coupling must be invariant. recalling that  acts diagonally
in k, it follows that its action on the open string sector is diagonal in i 8.

the argument in [30] now allows us to use this information on the open string sector

to constrain the closed string sector. since  commutes with k, we have

k,5 = +,5t

k,51

,5

(2.8)

comparing with (2.5), we learn that the projection  in the closed string sector must

include the additional (1) sign, as claimed above. this xes the z2 ambiguity in all

twisted sectors.

the bottomline of this argument is that the closed string spectrum of the 

orientifold of c2/zn produces n  1 tensor multiplets.

2.2 open string spectrum

we now turn to the open string spectrum and further consistency conditions on ,5.
it is convenient to introduce a concrete expression for ,5, which we take 9

,5 = diag (1n0, e2i 1

n 1n1, . . . , e2i n 1

n 1nn 1)

(2.9)

an interesting constraint on ,5 can be derived by requiring ()2 = n/2 in the
open string sector. the action of  on a state |, iji, corresponding to an open string
stretching between the ith and jth d-brane, is

 : |, iji  ()ii|  , j ii(1

)j j

(2.10)

7the  orientifold does not allow for the introduction of d9-branes. in section 3 d9-branes may

appear in some models where both the  and the usual  projections are imposed. the consistecy

conditions for d9-branes in those cases can derived by simple modications in our arguments below.
8in other words, i labels the dierent kinds of fractional branes [32], which can be understood as

higher-dimensional branes wrapped on the collapsed two-cycles of the orbifold singularity. since the

orientifold acts diagonally on the cycles, so it does on the wrapped branes.

9in the  orientifolds, a dierent model would be obtained for n ,5 = 1. it is easy to show that

they are identical in the  orientifold.

6

we are interested in comparing the actions of ()2 and n/2, given by

()2 :

n/2 :

|, iji  (,5(t
|, iji  (n/2,5)ii|n/2  , ij i(1

,5)1)ii|  , ij i(t
n/2,5)j j

,51

,5)j j

(2.11)

let us split the set of d-branes into two types, denoted even and odd, according to
whether their n/2 eigenvalue is +1 or 1. in the even-even and odd-odd sectors, n/2
acts as +1, and (2.11) imposes  = t
, with independent choices of sign for even
and odd d-branes. in the even-odd and odd-even sectors, n/2 acts as 1 and (2.11)

implies the symmetry of  must be opposite for even and odd branes. without
loss of generality we get the conditions

,5 = +t

,5

.5 = t

,5

for even branes

for odd branes

(2.12)

an appropriate choice of ,5 is

,5 = diag (1n0, n1, . . . , 1nn 2, nn 1)

(2.13)

notice that this type of constraint is satised only for n even. we also would like to

point out that the dierent symmetry of ,5 for even and odd branes is related by
t-duality to the change of sign of the o6-plane whenever it crosses a ns-brane. the

 orientifold hence provides a geometrical description of such process in a iib t-dual

realisation. it would be interesting to compare it with the geometries proposed in [33].

this completes the discussion on consistency conditions. let us turn to computing

the massless open string spectrum. the projection on the chan-paton factors for gauge

bosons is

 = ,51
,5
 = ,5t 1

,5

(2.14)

and leads to a gauge group

so(n0)  usp(n1)  . . .  so(nn 2)  usp(nn 1)

(2.15)

the projection on the matter chan-paton factors is

z1 = e2i/n ,5z11

z2 = ,5 z t

z2 = e2i/n ,5z21

we obtain the following hypermultiplet matter content

n 1

xi=0

1
2

( i,

i+1)

(2.17)

notice that the action of  as exchange of the two complex planes is essential in

obtaining half (rather than full) hypermultiplets.

thus, the spectrum in the closed and open string sectors agrees with the eld theory

constructed in section 1 from type iia brane congurations of ns- and d6-branes in

the presence of an o6-plane.

this eld theory is potentially anomalous. we now show that, in analogy with the

models in [6, 7, 21], the irreducible gauge anomaly vanishes once tadpole cancellation

conditions are imposed. the reader not interested in these details in encouraged to

skip the computation. the tadpoles can be obtained using the general techniques in

[13, 14], and we only stress the dierences between the  and  projections. since

the cylinder diagrams do not involve crosscaps, their contribution to the tadpoles is

the familiar one

c =

n 1

xk=1

4 sin2(

k
n

)(tr k,5)2

(2.18)

where the untwisted tadpole k = 0 vanishes in the non-compact limit and is therefore

ignored. the tadpoles from the mobius strip diagrams are quite similar to those in [14].
the only dierence is that the eigenvalues of the twists k that act along with  are
e2i/4 (and independent of k) rather than e2ik/n , and this modies the trigonometric

coecient of the tadpole. concretely we have

m = 16

k) = 32ntr n/2

(2.19)

k1

where we have used the property tr (t
k) = tr n/2. the klein bottle ampli-
tude k(n, k) is evaluated by tracing over the n-twisted closed string spectrum with
an insertion of k. since  acts diagonally in the twisted sector index, all values of
n contribute 10. we must take into account that, as in the mobius strip computation,
the eigenvalues for the twist k are e2i/4, and that for n = 0 zero mode factors
from momentum states should be included. the dierent contributions t (n, k) to

the tadpoles add up to

(2.22)

the tadpole cancellation conditions can be expressed in terms of the integers nr, yield-
ing the condition

 2nr + 16(1)r + nr1 + nr+1 = 0

(2.23)

this is the condition of cancellation of the irreducible anomaly in the eld theory

(2.15), (2.17). their solution is n2i = n + 8, n2i+1 = n. this solution reproduces the
result based on rr charge conservation in the type iia brane conguration discussed in

the introduction. the factorization of the remaining anomalies and their cancellation

by a green-schwarz mechanism involving the n  1 tensor multiplets [26] has been

discussed in [7], and we will not repeat it here.

3 theories with the  and  projections

in this section we comment on the consistency conditions in type iib orientifolds where

both the usual  and the new  projections are imposed. as in the construction of the

 orientifold, the t-dual type iia brane congurations will provide a useful guideline.

we are by now familiar with the fact that the  projection corresponds to the presence

of an o6-plane in the t-dual type iia model. similarly, the  projection corresponds

to the presence of two o8-planes (along 012345789) in the iia conguration. hence the

iia brane congurations for the models in this section include orientifold projections

by both o6- and o8-planes. the general features of these congurations have been

discussed in [18], and in [34] in more detail.

we consider type iib on c2/zn, with n = 2k, modded out by the orientifold

projections  and . a rst observation is that closure requires the introduction of

the element  in the orbifold group. the generators  and  satisfy the properties

n = 1 ; 2 = k ;  n = n 

(3.1)

these relations dene the non-abelian discrete group dk. hence we are dealing with
orientifolds of c2/dk. how does this arise in the iia brane conguration?

9

3.1 the iia brane congurations

the answer goes as follows.
in a type iia brane conguration with o6- and o8-
planes, the orientifolds impose the projections o6  (1)flr7r8r9 and o8  r6,
respectively, where ri acts as xi  xi. by closure, the conguration is also modded
out by the orbifold element r = (1)flr6r7r8r9.

it is illustrative to consider momentarily the conguration modded out only by

r, without any orientifold projection. such brane congurations were studied in [35]

and shown to reproduce eld theories with gauge groups and matter contents dened

by dk quiver diagramas [4]. furthermore, these congurations have been argued to
be t-dual to systems of d5-branes at c2/dk singularities [34]. the type iia brane

congurations we are actually interested in contain an additional orientifold projection,
say, by o6. hence their type iib t-duals should correspond to orientifolds of c2/dk
singularities, as found above.

let us consider the iia brane congurations is some more detail. since they contain

an o6-plane which ips charge whenever it crosses a ns-brane, n is constrained to

be even, n = 2k. another consistency condition is that no ns-brane can intersect

the o8-planes, since the o6-plane crossing them would not respect the z2 symmetry

imposed by the o8-plane. for a xed k, in order to specify the model completely one
has to make the following choices. first, the charge of the two o8-planes 11, which

can be positive for one and negative for the other  in which case their rr charge

cancels and no d8-branes are required  or negative for both in which case rr charge

cancellation requires 32 d8-branes, as counted in the covering space; in this case one

also has to choose the distribution of the d8-branes in the dierent intervals, in a way

consistent with the orientifold symmetries . second, the charge assignment for the

dierent pieces of o6-plane in the intervals. finally, the number of d6-branes ni at
each interval i is determined by the conditions or rr charge conservation [18, 17]. the

solution to these conditions is unique up to an overall addition of an equal number of

d6-branes in all intervals.

to make the discussion a bit more concrete, consider the case of even k. there are

two possible patterns for the gauge group

g0  usp(n1)  so(n2)  . . .  usp(nk 1)  gk

g0  so(n1)  usp(n2)  . . .  so(nk 1)  gk

(3.2)

11our convention is that an o8+-plane has +16 units of d8-brane charge, and projects the gauge
group of k coincident d6-branes down to so(k), and that an o8-plane, with 16 units of d8-brane

charge, produces a gauge group u sp(k) on k d6-branes.

10

second) possibility corresponds to the case when the o8-planes are
the st (resp.
intersected by o6- (resp. o6+)- planes. the nature of the factors g0 and gk is more
model-dependent and will be discussed below. when k is odd, the general structure

of the gauge group is

g0  usp(n1)  so(n2)  . . .  usp(nk 2)  so(nk 1)  gk

(3.3)

in any case, the general structure of the matter content is given by

fundamental representations must be added [34].

let us now specify the structure of the end sectors in the above spectra, where

a certain number n of d6-branes suers the projection by an o8-plane and an o6-

plane. there are four dierent cases to be considered, depending on the charges of the

orientifold planes, and they lead to dierent group factors and matter contents [34].

i) when the projection is imposed by an o8-plane and an o6-plane, the corre-

sponding gauge factor is su(n/2) and the representation r0 or rk in (3.4) is + .
ii) when there is an o8+-plane and an o6+-plane, we obtain the same answer: the

gauge factor is su(n/2) and the representation r0 or rk is + .

iii) for an o8-plane and an o6+ plane, the gauge factor is usp(n)  usp(n) and

the representation r0 or rk is ( , 1) + (1, ).

iv) for an o8+-plane and an o6 plane, the gauge factor is so(n)  so(n) and

the representation r0 or rk is ( , 1) + (1, ).

concerning the ns-brane world-volume elds, we obtain k tensor multiplets from

the k ns-branes in the conguration. there are also twisted elds living at the xed
points of (1)flr6r7r8r9. for end sectors of the type i) or ii) each orbifold plane
gives rise to a hypermultiplet. for end sectors of the type iii) or iv), each produces

one tensor multiplet.

in the resulting eld theory, the ranks of the gauge groups are determined by

imposing the charge cancellation conditions in the iia brane conguration. these

include the the charges with respect to the twisted elds of the orbifold plane. in the

cases without d8-branes, on which we center henceforth for the sake of clarity, this last
condition implies n = n in the cases iii) and iv).

in the following subsection we show how these rules arise in the construction of the

type iib orientifolds,

11

3.2 the orientifold construction

even though as explained above we are dealing with an orientifold of a dk singularity,

it will be convenient to continue discussing in terms of a zn singularity modded out by

the two orientifold projections  and . this is useful since it allows to benet from

the known results about models with either of the projections, taken from section 2 for

the  and from [6, 21] for the  projections. there are nevertheless some important
instances where the additional elements k in the orbifold group play a role.

one of these situations is the computation of the closed string spectrum. the model

contains a twisted sector for each one of the k + 2 non-trivial conjugacy classes of the

orbifold group dk. these classes are

cn = {n, n} n = 1, . . . , k  1

,

ck = {k}

ceven = {, 2, . . . , 2k 2} ,

codd = {, . . . , 2k 1}

(3.5)

we see that the new elements in the orbifold group generate new twisted sectors, but

also introduce identications in the twisted sectors of zn. in type iib theory, each

sector produces a hyper and a tensor multiplet. in the orientifolded theory, the action of
 and  on the classes cn, n = 1, . . . , k selects the tensor multiplet, while the action
on the remaining classes may select the tensor or hypermultiplet. the relevant cases
are discussed in the examples below. notice that the action of  on the n/2-twisted

sector corresponds to a projection with vector structure.

another consequence of the new elements in the orbifold group is that the d5- and
d9-branes in the model generate new disk tadpoles twisted by these elements k.

these do not have a corresponding crosscap diagram, so cancellation of these tadpoles

requires conditions of the type

tr k,9  2tr k,5 = 0

(3.6)

where the factor of two arises form momentum zero modes, and the rst term is required

only in cases with d9-branes. this condition is the iib counterpart of the cancellation

of charge under the twisted elds of the orbifold in the iia brane conguration. we

will make sure this condition is satised for the matrices in our models.

let us turn to the explicit construction. intead of being completely general, it will

be illustrative to consider two examples, which include all the dierent end sectors
discussed in section 3.1. let us consider c2/zn with n = 2k and k odd, and mod it
by  and , with 2 = . as explained in [21], the presence of  in the  projection

implies the model contains no d9-branes, a conveniently simple case. let us consider

12

the chan-paton matrices

,5 = diag (1n0, e2i 1

n 1nk1, e2i k
,5 = diag (n0, 1n1, . . . , nk1, 1nk , nk1, . . . , 1n1)

n 1nk , e2i k+1

notice that the matrices k = k are traceless, so the additional disk tadpoles
mentioned above vanish. the open string spectrum one obtains from the projection

using the matrices above is

u(n0/2)  so(n1)  . . .  usp(nk 1)  u(nk/2)

i=1

the closed string spectrum contains k tensor multiplets and two hypermultiplets.

this model has a clear type iia t-dual conguration. it contains n ns branes, two

o8-planes (not intersected by any ns-brane) and one o6-plane. the  projection

above corresponds to the case where the o8-planes are oppositely charged [21]. the
choice of chan-paton matrices ,  above species that the o8+ is intersected by
an o6+, and the o8 by an o6. using the rules of section 3.1 we obtain a gauge

group and matter content in agreement with (3.8).

let us turn to the discussion of cancellation of tadpoles in the type iib side. instead

of performing it in the usual way, by factorizing klein bottle, mobius strip and cylinder

diagrams, one can take advantage of knowing directly the contributions of the  [21]
and  crosscaps (section 2 12). the tadpole condition reads

4 sin2(

k
n

)tr k,5  32k,1 mod 2 + 16nk,n/2 = 0

(3.9)

this expression agrees with that obtained performing the standard computation. this

condition can be recast in terms of the integers nr, giving

 2nr + nr1 + nr+1 + 16r,0  16r,k  16(1)r = 0

(3.10)

12actually, the slightly dierent form of  in this section introduces a 1 sign in the crosscap

computed in section 1. also notice that the crosscap in [21] should be multiplied by 4, since our

models are six-dimensional.

13

these conditions correspond precisely to the constraints from cancellation of the irre-

ducible anomaly, and to the conditions of rr charge conservation in the t-dual type

iia brane conguration. the residual gauge anomaly is factorized and cancelled as

discussed in [18, 34] by exchange of the closed string tensor multiplets [26]. also, the

u(1) anomalies are cancelled by hypermultiplet exchange.

the second example we consider is a slight modication of the previous model. let
us again consider c2/zn, with n = 2k and k odd, modded out by  and . let

us choose the chan-paton embedding of ,5 and ,5 to be exactly as in (3.7), but
let us take

,5 = diag (1  1n0/2, n1, . . . , 1nk1, i2  1nk /2, 1nk1, . . . , n1)

(3.11)

notice that ,5 by itself is equivalent to (2.13), despite the modication of the blocks
at the positions 0 and k. the modication is required so that the matrices k are
traceless, as required for consistency. the nal spectrum of this model is

[so(n0/2)  so(n0/2)]  so(n1)  . . .  usp(nk 1)  [usp(nk/2)  usp(nk/2)]

(3.12)

the closed string spectrum gives k + 2 tensor multiplets.

the interpretation in terms of the t-dual type iia brane conguration is identical

to the one we had for the previous model, save for a ip in the sign of the o6-plane.
hence in this model the o8+-plane is intersected by an o6-plane, and the o8-plane
is intersected by an o6+-plane. the spectrum (3.12) agrees with the rules given in

section 3.1, in particular with the end sectors proposed in rules iii) and iv).

the tadpole cancellation condition is identical to (3.9), save for a ip in the sign

of the k,n/2 contribution. they correspond to the conditions of cancellation of the
irreducible anomaly and the rr charge conservation in the iia brane conguration.

these two examples illustrate the construction of type iib orientifolds with the 

and  projections. they also provide a non-trivial check of the rules proposed for the

brane congurations. a complete classication of models is straightforward to perform,

but lenghy to list and does not provide further insights, therefore we spare the reader

their discussion.

finally, we would like to point out that some of the orientifolds of c2/dk which

can be obtained using our indications have already appeared in section 7 of [7]. our

discussion, however, includes several cases not considered in this reference. we see that

the type iia brane congurations, which inspired the construction of our orientifolds,

have provided a really insightful guideline in our task.
