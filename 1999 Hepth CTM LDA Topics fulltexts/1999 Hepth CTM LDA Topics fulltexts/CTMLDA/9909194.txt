resulting d-brane, consider tachyon kink solution form: t0, x < 0 0, = 0 t0, x > 0 (3.1) (x) = x one particular coordinate world-volume non-bps dp-brane. get equation motion tachyon variation (2.2), give (we consider dependence tachyon x, say p coordinate): f form: f = 22 g dx f xt! df dt = 0 + v (t ) + f (t ) g (cid:16) g r0l(cid:17) first equation (3.2) gives ( gx xt (x)) = ( gx)xt = 0 (3.2) (3.3) (3.4) used fact tachyon eld function x fact look solution (3.1) extreme limit ordinary kink solution, behaviour tachyon eld approximated around point x = 0 x. precisely, take solution equal tachyon vacuum value t0 distance x = l point x = 0 get tachyon eld around point x = 0 form = t0 l x. clear second derivative expression zero. order get (3.1) must take limit l 0 x 0 way 0 x 0. outside
