abstract. the solution of some equations involving functional derivatives is given as a series indexed by
planar binary trees. the terms of the series are given by an explicit recursive formula. some algebraic
properties of these series are investigated. several examples are treated in the case of quantum electrody-
namics: the complete fermion and photon propagators, the two-body green function, and the one-body
green function in the presence of an external source, the complete vacuum polarization, electron self-energy
and irreducible vertex.

1 introduction

renormalization theory has been recently revitalized by
the discovery a hopf algebra that transforms the dreadful
combinatorics of renormalization into a mechanical appli-
cation of the hopf algebra properties of rooted trees [1,2,
3].

in the companion paper [4], butchers theory has been
presented as an alternative way to describe the hopf struc-
ture of the algebra of renormalization. a particularly use-
ful aspect of butchers approach is that solutions of non-
linear dierential equations can be written as a sum over
rooted trees.

in the present paper, butchers strategy is adapted to
equations involving functional derivatives, that were rst
proposed by schwinger [5] and will be called schwinger
equations in the rest of the paper. schwinger equations
are not commonly considered as a useful tool for compu-
tation. the purpose of this article is to show that, by using
series over planary binary trees, schwinger equations can
be turned into explicit calculation methods.

the series we manipulate are indexed by planar bi-
nary trees. so we rst present some basic properties of
planar binary trees. then the solution of simple schwinger
equations are written as a sum over planar binary trees,
with recursively dened coecients. to make a compari-
son with power series, the schwinger equation would cor-
respond to a dierential equation for the sum of the series,
whereas the formula we put forward corresponds to a re-
cursive denition of the terms of the series: it does not
contain so much information as the schwinger equation,
but it is more explicit to calculate the terms of the series.
as an example, the full fermion and photon propaga-
tors of quantum electrodynamics (qed) are written as a

sum over planar binary trees. renormalization is briey
described and applications are given for qed with an ex-
ternal source, the vacuum polarization, the fermion self-
energy and the irreducible vertex.

2 planar binary trees

in contrast to ref.[4], we do not use rooted trees but pla-
nar binary trees. both can be drawn on a plane, but no
permutation of vertices is allowed for planar trees.

as an example,

and

are two dierent planar

trees, although they represent the same rooted tree.





in planar trees, we distinguish two types of vertices:
the leaves (which have no sons) and the remaining ver-
tices (including the root), which we call internal vertices.
in planar binary trees, internal vertices have exactly two
sons.

we now follow the notation of loday and ronco [6].
planar binary trees have an odd number of vertices. we
denote yn the set of planar binary trees with 2n + 1 ver-
tices. if t belongs to yn, t has n + 1 leaves and n internal
vertices. the number of elements of yn is
n!(n+1)! : the
catalan numbers, which enter many combinatorial prob-
lems [7] and should probably be called ming numbers [8].
if t1  ym and t2  yn, the grafting of t1 and t2 is the tree
t  ym+n+1 obtained by putting t1 on the left of t2 and by
joining the roots of t1 and t2 to a new vertex that becomes
the root of t. this operation is denoted by t = t1  t2. for

(2n)!

in the companion paper, rooted trees were graded by
the number of their vertices. here, planar binary trees
have an odd number of vertices, and it is more natural
to grade them dierently: for each tree t, we dene |t| as
the integer n such that t  yn. thus, a tree t has 2|t| + 1
vertices.

an essential property of planar binary trees is that
each tree t dierent from  can be written in a unique
way as t1  t2, where t1 and t2 are called the branches
of t. moreover, grafting provides a recursive denition of
planar binary trees [9]:

n1

yk  ynk1,

y0 = {}.

(1)

yn =

[k=0

the notation yk  ynk1 means that all the trees of yk
are grafted with all the trees of ynk1.

planar binary trees have received much attention re-
cently because of their relation to new algebraic structures
[9,10].

3 schwinger equations

in this section, the solution of a linear schwinger equation
is given as a sum over planar binary trees. but we rst
introduce the concept of a functional derivative.

a functional a() is dened loosely as a map sending
a distribution  to a complex number (see ref.[11] for de-
tails). if  is a distribution, the functional derivative of
a() in the direction  is dened as the limit for   0 of
(a( + )  a())/. finally, the functional derivative of
a() with respect to (x), a()
(x) , is dened as the func-
tional derivative of a() in the direction x, where x is
the dirac function x(y) = (y  x).

3.1 examples of functional derivatives

a()
(x) = f (x). a further example, that will be useful in

a classical example is a() =r dxf (x)(x), giving easily
the sequel, is a() =r dxdyf (x, y)(x)(y). then
= z dyf (x, y)(y) +z dyf (y, x)(y),

a()
(x)

where sn is the set of permutations of n elements.

in practice, a() is often a green function. take the
green function dened by (x(x))a(; x, y) = (xy),
which can be written a() = (  )1. to calculate the
functional derivative, we put a( + ) = (    )1.
the operator identity y 1 = x 1+x 1(x y )y 1 gives
us a( + ) = a() + a()a( + ). thus, taking
the limit   0,

a(; x, y)



=z dsa(; x, s)(s)a(; s, y).

if we choose now the distribution (s) = (s  z) we nd

a(; x, y)

(z)

= a(; x, z)a(; z, y).

(2)

this identity will be used repeatedly in the sequel.

3.2 a simple schwinger equation

as an introduction to the method of planar binary trees
we consider the schwinger equation

x = a + f (x,

x
v(z)

),

(3)

where a is a functional of v, f is linear in x and x
v(z) ,
and z is a variable over which f integrates. in an equation
like (3), f is called the integral operator of the equation
and a is called its initial data.

a common example of such an equation is obtained
when x = x(x, y), the initial data a(x, y) are the green
function (x v(x))a(x, y) = (xy) discussed in section
3.1 and the integral operator is

f (x,

x
v(z)

)(x, y) = z dsdzx(x, s)f (s, z)

x(s, y)

v(z)

,

for some function f (s, z).

such a schwinger equation summarizes an innity of
equations that can be obtained by taking successive func-
tional derivatives of eq.(3) with respect to v(z).

x = a + f (x,

x
v(z)

),

x

v(z1)

=

a

v(z1)

+ f (

,

x
v(z)

) +

x

v(z1)
2x

2a()

(x)(y)

(y)



=

a()
(x)

= f (x, y) + f (y, x).

f (x,

  

v(z1)v(z)

),

more generally, if

a() =z dx1 . . . dxnf (x1, . . . , xn)(x1) . . . (xn),

then

na()

(x1)    (xn)

= xsn

f (x(1), . . . , x(n)),

when we take the n-th functional derivative of both sides
of the (n-1)-th equation with respect to v(zn), the equa-
tion gets an additional variable zn, and the chain rule is
v(zn) to the right-hand side of the (n-1)-th
used to apply
equation.



if this is iterated to all values of n, we obtain an innite
system of nonlinear integral equations. this system seems
dicult to solve because the n-th dierential of x depends
on the k-th dierentials of x for k = 0 to n + 1.

3.3 the series solution

eq.(4), this denes (t) recursively. the recursive deni-
tion of (t) is given explicitly by

to write the solution of eq.(3), we must introduce some
notation. sets of arguments will be often needed, so we
write {z}i,j = zi, zi+1, . . . , zj, ({z}i,j =  if j < i). fur-
thermore, if f ({z}1,n) = f (z1, . . . , zn) is a function of n
variables, then f({z}1,n) is dened as the sum of n terms,
where the rst variable z1 is shifted step by step from the
rst to the n-th position:

f({z}1,n) = f ({z}1,n) + f (z2, z1, {z}3,n) +    +
f ({z}2,n1, z1, zn) + f ({z}2,n, z1).

for each planar binary tree t, we dene an innite-
dimensional vector (t), with components n(t), where n
goes from 0 to innity. the n-th component is a function
of n variables z1, . . . , zn. now we dene the initial data.
for t = , we take 0() = a and

1(; z1) =

a

v(z1)

.

(4)

the most natural choice is to dene n() as 1/n! times
the n-th functional derivative of a with respect to v(z),
but this is not always the most economical choice in prac-
tice. the only condition that we need for n > 1 is

n(t; {z}1,n) =

n

xk=0

f(cid:0)k(t1; {z}1,k),

nk+1


(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1),

(8)

for t 6=  and n() is dened in eq.(6).

in a quantum eld interpretation,  represents the bare
represents the interaction, and the sum over
elds,
trees represents all the combinations of interaction that
gives the full propagator.



a proof of eqs.(7) and (8) is given in the appendix.

3.4 enumeration

if the initial data a is such that n() has only one term,
as in eq.(6), the chain rule applied to the functional deriva-
tive gives a number of terms for n(t) that we denote
|n(t)|. equation (8) gives us the following recurrence re-
lation for |n(t)|:

n

|n(t)| =

(n  k + 1)|k(t1)||nk+1(t2)|,

xk=0

|n()| = 1.

n1(; {z}1,n1)

v(zn)

= n

(; {z}1,n).

(5)

using the binomial identity

when a(x, y) is a green function of the kind discussed
in section 3.1, it is not dicult to build such a () from
given initial data a. we can use eq.(2) to show that

n

xk=0(cid:18)a + k

a (cid:19)(cid:18)b + n  k

b

(cid:19) = (cid:18)a + b + n + 1
a + b + 1 (cid:19),

it can be shown that the solution of this equation is

0() = a(x, y),

1(; z1) = a(x, z1)a(z1, y),

. . .

|n(t)| = (t)(cid:18)2|t| + n
2|t| (cid:19),

n(; {z}1,n) = a(x, z1)a(z1, z2) . . . a(zn, y),

(6)

where (t) is an integer which depends only on the tree t
(not on n) and is dened recursively by

satises eq.(4) and condition (5).

with this notation we can now write the solution of

eq.(3) as

(t) = (t1)(2|t2| + 1) (t2),
() = 1.

t1 and t2 are the two branches of t.

(7)

3.5 a compact notation

to write a compact expression for the recursive denition
of (t) we dene the deconcatenation of (z1, . . . , zn) by
[12]

where t spans the set of planar binary trees. moreover

0(t),

x = xt

x

v(z1)

nx

v(z1)    v(zn)

1(t; z1),

. . .

= xt
= xsnxt

n(t; z(1), . . . , z(n)).

(z1, . . . , zn) =

(z1, . . . , zi)  (zi+1, . . . , zn).

i=n

xi=0

for each planar binary tree t, the vector (t) is calcu-
lated as a function of the vectors (t1) and (t2), where
t1 and t2 are the branches of t. since () is dened from

if x belongs to the vector space v , the map  acts on the
yn  v n. sometimes, as in

tensor module t (v ) =



ln=0

4

qed,  is dened on t (v )m , where m is a xed vector
space, for instance m = v 2 for the photon propagator.

we dene the operator d(z) by

d(z)n(t; z1, . . . , zn) = n+1

 (t; z, z1, . . . , zn).

the recursive denition of  becomes

(t) = f (cid:0)id  d(z))  ((t1)  (t2))  ,

where f (a  b) = f (a, b).

it would be interesting to nd a family of equations
such that, for any  from t (v ) to c, there is a member
of the family of which  is a solution. this would gener-
alize butchers density theorem[13], and would provide a
general class of equations that would be satised by the
renormalized green functions.

3.6 algebra structure

in the case of rooted trees, butcher [14] has dened a
group structure of runge-kutta methods that hairer and
wanner [15] interpreted as a composition of butcher se-
ries. a similar approach can be used for planar binary
trees. a powerful aspect of butchers approach is that al-
gebraic operations are dened on two spaces at the same
time: the space of runge-kutta methods, and the space
of maps over trees. the same strategy will be used here,
and the operations will be dened on the space of integral
operators and on the space of maps over planar binary
trees.

we start with the addition. if we have two schwinger
equations x = a + f (x, x
v ), the
addition of the integral operators is h = f + g and the
addition of the maps  (corresponding to the rst equa-
tion) and  (for the second equation) is dened recursively
by n() = n() + n() and

v ) and y = b + g(y, y

n(t; {z}1,n) =

n

xk=0

n



f(cid:0)k(t1; {z}1,k), nk+1
xk=0

g(cid:0)k(t1; {z}1,k), nk+1



(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1) +

(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1).

this addition denes clearly a commutative group struc-
ture for the integral operators. it denes also a commuta-
tive group structure for the space of maps, where the unit
element is (t) = 0 for all t, and the opposite of (t) is
(t) = (1)|t|(t).

multiplication by a scalar  is dened similarly. an
integral operator f becomes f , and the corresponding
map (t) becomes |t|(t). notice that maps are not equiv-
alent to integral operators since they contain also the ini-
tial data. the present denition of the multiplication by
a scalar corresponds to the case where the initial data are
not changed. if the initial data are also multiplied by ,
then (t) becomes |t|+1(t).

this addition is useful when a schwinger equation is
the sum of various terms. addition and multiplication by
a scalar is probably all we need to renormalize quantum
electrodynamics. however, we can proceed with butchers
strategy and dene another operation coming from a com-
position of solutions. if we start from two schwinger equa-
tions x = a + f (x, x
v ), the com-
position of the solutions is dened as the y obtained with
the initial data b = x.

v ) and y = b + g(y, y

it is shown in the appendix that, if  is the map corre-

sponding to y (i.e. y =pt (t)), then (t) = (t) + (t),

where (t) is the map associated to the equation for x
and n(t) is given by n() = 0 and

n

n(t; {z}1,n) =

nk+1


(t2; z; {z}k+1,n) + nk+1

xk=0

g(cid:0)k(t1; {z}1,k) + k(t1; {z}1,k),
(t2; z; {z}k+1,n)(cid:1). (9)



this denes a product of integral operators and of maps.
in the rst proof of eq.(9) given in the appendix, the
integral operator corresponding to this product is con-

structed. notice that this operator acts on vectors(cid:0) x
x+y(cid:1).

this product has a unit element (given by g = 0).

in the next section, the present method will be applied

to the example of quantum electrodynamics (qed).

4 the case of qed

we work in the at minkowski space with a diagonal met-
ric g (the diagonal is (1, 1, 1, 1)). the electron charge
is e = |e|. repeated indices are summed over.

in 1951, schwinger [5] devised coupled equations in-
volving functional derivatives of s(x, y; j), the full fermion
propagator of qed in the presence of an external electro-
magnetic source j(x):

[g  (1  )]a (x; j) = j(x) 
ietr[s(x, x; j)],

hi  m  ea(x; j) + ie

j(x)is(x, y; j) =



(x  y). (10)

in principles, these equations determine s(x, y; j) com-
pletely.

building on a work by polivanov [16], bogoliubov and
shirkov [17] transformed this equation into a schwinger
equation coupling the full fermion propagator s(x, y) with
the full photon propagator d(x, y):

[g  (1  )]d(x, y) = g

 (x  y) 

a (z)

(cid:3)d(z, y; a),
(cid:2)i  m  ea(x)(cid:3)s(x, y; a) = (x  y) +

iez d4z d(x, z; a)

s(x, y; a)

a(z)

,

(11)

(12)

the method of the previous section is now used to write
the solution of eq.(13). since s0(x, z; a) depends on the
external potential a(x), the small extension presented in
the appendix is required. all quantities will be taken at
a(x) = 0, so the external potential will not be mentioned
(e.g. s(x, y) means s(x, y; a) at a = 0).

the notation {, z}i,j = i, zi, i+1, zi+1, . . . , j , zj en-

ables us to write the solution as

another change in the notation is that trees have now two
colors. the map (t) has a supersymmetric avor because
it has a fermion component for the full fermion propagator
and a photon component for the full photon propagator. it
is convenient to transfer the fermion/photon index from 
to the tree t. thus, (t) is the photon component of (t)
and (t) is its fermion component. futhermore, (t) will
be drawn with a white root and (t) with a black root.
all trees are built as t
2, where the white (photon)

this is still a recursive denition, but it uses now the
smaller components of  for the same tree t. notice that
the rst term of eq.(18) is absent if n = 0.

two remarks can be useful at this point. firstly, con-
sidering all quantities at a = 0, we nd as in section 3.1

6

christian brouder: on the trees of quantum elds

that s0(x, y)/a(z) = es0(x, z)s0(z, y). therefore,
in the denition of n(), a factor en was suppressed and
transferred to the solution eqs.(14) and (15). it must be
checked that this is compatible with renormalization. sec-
ondly, it will be shown in section 6.1 that, from furrys
theorem, the components n(t) are zero when n is odd.
this reduces the sums in eqs.(16), (17) and (18) to the
even components of (t

1).

in other words, n() is a propagator with n dangling
photon lines (n starts at 0). more generally, all the com-
ponents n(t) or n(t) has n dangling photon lines. to
see the action of the recursive equation for the photon,
observe that, in eq.(17) the fermion extremities of t
1 are
closed on an additional photon line by a bare vertex (on
the left), and each dangling photon line of t
1 is linked in
turn to the photon extremities of t
2 (on the right). dia-

for the fermion propagator, in eqs.(16) and (18), each
dangling photon line of t

linked to the left extremity of the electron propagator t

if we neglect the rst term in eq.(18) we can write

diagrammatically:

(cid:30)

as a warm-up exercice, we can calculate the number of
diagrams in the component n(t), that we denote |n(t)|.
from eqs.(16) and (17) we nd the equations for |n(t)|
and |n(t)|

|n(t)| =

|n(t)| =

xk=0

(n  k + 1)|k(t

1)||nk+1(t

2)|,

with n() = 1, n( ) = n,0.

the solution of this recursive equation is

n (cid:19),
|n(t)| = (t)(cid:18)2|t| + n
|n(t)| = (t)(cid:18)2|t| + n  1
(cid:19),

n

where (t) does not depend on the colour of t and was
dened in section 3.4.

this can be used to calculate the total number of dia-
grams for the electron or photon propagators (the number
is the same) contributing at e2n. let us dene

sn = xtyn

(t) = xtyn

(t1)(2|t2| + 1) (t2).

using eq.(1) for n > 0 we nd

n1

(t1) x|t2|=nk1

(2|t2| + 1) (t2)

sn =

=

n1

xk=0 x|t1|=k
xk=0

(2k + 1)sksnk1.

the starting value is s0 = 1. for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 this
gives us 1, 1, 4, 27, 248, 2830, in agreement with refs.[18,
19]. the generating function y(x) for the sequence sn sat-
ises the dierential equation 2x2yy + xy2  y + 1 = 0
with y(0) = 1.

this enumation takes into account neither symmetry
nor furrys theorem, which says that |n(t)| = 0 if n is
odd. the main point of this enumeration is to show that
each tree represents the sum of a large number of diagrams
when |t| is large. this may prove useful for practical cal-
culations.

4.4 fourier transform

5 renormalization

in applications, it is often convenient to work in the k-
space. the fourier transform of (t; x, y; {, z}1,n) is de-
ned by

(t; q, q; {, p}1,n) = z d4xd4yd4z1 . . . d4zn

ei(qxqy+p1z1++pnzn)(t; x, y; {, z}1,n).

this corresponds to outgoing momenta pi along the dan-
gling photon lines. if this is introduced into eqs.(16) and
(17), we nd

(t; q, q; {, p}1,n) = (2)4(q + p1 +    + pn  q)

(t; q; {, p}1,n).

the full fermion and photon propagators in fourier

space are

s(q) = xt
d(q) = xt

e2|t|0(t; q),

e2|t|0

(t; q).

here (t) satises the recursive relation
n(t; q; {, p}1,n) = s0(q)1

n(; q; {, p}1,n) = s0(q)1 s0(q + p1)2    n

s0(q + p1 +    + pn).

as for the real space case, the rst term of eq.(19) is

absent for n = 0 and

n
(t; q; {, p}1,n) = n(t; q; {, p}1,n) +

n(t; q; 2, p2, 1, p1, {, p}3,n) +    +
n(t; q; {, p}2,n, 1, p1).

in ref.[4], it has been shown that the renormalization
through hopf algebra created by kreimer could be done
also within the butcher approach using a dierence of
runge-kutta methods (bare quantities minus countert-
erms). the same method can be tried here.

if x = a + f (x, x

v(z) ) is the equation to renormalize,
and if r represents a renormalization prescription (see
ref.[2]), then the renormalized eld xr is given by

0
r(t),

xr = xt

where r(t) is dened recursively from the integral oper-
ator f  r  f by n

r() = n() and

n

n

r(t; {z}1,n) =

xk=0

f(cid:0)k
rhf(cid:0)k

r(t1; {z}1,k), nk+1

r

(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)) 

r(t1; {z}1,k), nk+1

r

(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1)i.

within this approach, renormalization looks rather sim-
ple. at each stage of a calculation, use the renormalized 
instead of the bare ones, and subtract the singularity. this
rule seems promissing for the case of qed, where n()
is regular and needs not be renormalized, and where each
recursive operation involves only a single loop (a fermion
loop for the photon propagator and a photon loop for the
fermion propagator). since k
(t2) are reg-
ular, there is no subdivergence, and thus no overlapping
divergence problem.

r(t1) and nk+1

r

following kreimer [2], the renormalization group equa-
tions are a consequence of the fact that f  r(f ) =
r(f )r(f )+f r(f ) is independent of the parameters
of r.

clearly, this presentation of renormalization is far too
sketchy and further investigation is required to include
renormalization prescriptionsa and calculation of coun-
terterms, and to check that the results are the same as
in the standard theory.

6 applications

in this section, the previous results are applied to furrys
theorem and the ward-takahashi identities. finally, a sum
over trees is dened for the two-particle green function.

6.1 furrys theorem

within our approach, furrys theorem implies n(t) =
0 for odd n. to show this, remark that, in eq.(20), the
integral

again, furrys theorem enables us to restrict the sum to
the even components of  (t).

is a fermion loop with n  k + 2 external photon lines.
according to furrys theorem, this loop is zero when n k
is odd. from its explicit denition, n() = 0 is zero if n
is odd (in fact, it is zero if n  1). we reason recursively on
the number of vertices of t. if n(t) = 0 for odd n and t
with up to 2n  1 vertices, take t with 2n + 1 vertices. in
eq.(20), the integral over p is zero if n  k is odd (furrys
theorem) and k(t
1 has less
vertices than t). thus, for the left-hand side of eq.(20) to
be eventually non-zero, k and n  k must be even, so n
must be even. therefore, n(t) = 0 for odd n.

1) is zero if k is odd (because t

6.2 ward-takahashi identities

within the present approach, the ward-takahashi identi-
ties take the form

x

k n+1

 (t; q; , k, {, p}1,n) = n(t; q; {, p}1,n) 

n(t; q + k; {, p}1,n). (21)

again, these identities will be proved recursively over
the number of vertices of t. an elementary calculation
shows that eq.(21) is true for t =  (ref.[20], p.238).
using eq.(29), we can write eq.(21) as

k

x

 n(t; q; {, p}1,n)

a(k)

= n(t; q; {, p}1,n) 

n(t; q + k; {, p}1,n).

1) adds a photon line to k

the last equation can be proved by applying the dieren-
a(k) to both sides of eq.(19). con-
sider rst the second term of eq.(19). the dierential op-
erator acting on k
1),
which gives zero by furrys theorem. the dierential op-
erator acting on nk+1
2) will transform according to
eq.(22), which is valid because t
2 has less vertices than
t. carrying out the sum over k, we see that eq.(22) is
true for the second term of the right-hand side of eq.(19).
consider now the rst term of eq.(19). for n = 0 it
does not exist, so eq.(22) is proved for n = 0 because it
is true for the second term. the recursion runs now over
n, the functional derivative operates either on s0(q) or on
n1(t; q + p1; {, p}2,n). since eq.(22) is true for both,
and for the second term, it is true for n(t; q; {, p}1,n).

6.3 homology and ward-takahashi identities

the previous ward-takashi indentities induce a boundary
operator on (t). in that case, we need to start from the
fully symmetrized form of :

n

n (t; q; {, z}1,n) = xsn

n(t; q; {, z}(1),(n)).

we dene i by

i n
k n

x

n (t; q; {, z}1,i1, , k, {, z}i+1,n) =

n (t; q; {, z}1,i1, , k, {, z}i+1,n) =

n1
n1(t; q; {, z}1,i1, {, z}i+1,n) 
n1
n1(t; q + k; {, z}1,i1, {, z}i+1,n),

where the last line is the ward-takahashi identity. if we
write the usual expression for the boundary operator

 n

n (t; q; {, z}1,n) =

n

xi=1

(1)ii n

n (t; q; {, z}1,n),

we nd by explicit calculation that 2 = 0. this was
proved for the fermion component, but 2 = 0 for the
photon component too, because i = 0 thanks to furrys
theorem. notice that, for n = 0 we have put 0(t) = 0.

6.4 two-particle green function

in ref.[5] schwinger proceeds by giving an equation for
the full two-particle fermion green function:

 m  ea(x1; j) + ie

hix

1



j(x1)i

s(x1, x2; y1, y2; j) = (x1  y1)s(x2, y2; j) 

(x1  y2)s(x2, y1; j).

from the identity [17]



j (x)

= z dyg(y, x)



a(y)

,

we go from the j to the a variable (in the limit a=0)

 m  ea(x1)]s(x1, x2; y1, y2; a) =

(x1  y1)s(x2, y2; a)  (x1  y2)s(x2, y1; a) +

1

hix
iez d4z s(x1, x2; y1, y2; a)

a(z)

g(z, x1).

it remains to multiply by s0 and to take a = 0. this
yields

s(x1, x2; y1, y2) = s0(x1, y1)s(x2, y2)  s0(x1, y2)s(x2, y1)

+iez d4zd4zs0(x1, z) s(z, x2; y1, y2)

a(z)

g(z, z). (23)

in eq.(23), s(x, y) plays the role of initial data, whereas
it is the solution of eq.(13). therefore, we are making a
composition of solution, which was considered in section
3.6. the situation is not exactly the same as that of sec-
tion 3.6, but the proof is similar (only more cumbersome)

and we obtain an expression for the two-particule green
function as a sum over planar binary trees.

7 vacuum polarization, self-energy

to calculate vacuum polarization and self-energy, we in-
troduce a further operation on planar binary trees. let

p (t) =

n(t)

xi=1

ui  vi,

(24)

where n(t) is an integer recursively dened by

n() = 0,
n(t) = 0
n(t) = 1 + n(t2)

if

t = t1  ,

if

t = t1  t2,

t2 6= ,

and the planar binary trees ui and vi are determined by

p () = 0,
p (t) = 0

if

t = t1  ,

n(t2)

p (t) = (t1  )  t2 +

xi=1

if

t = t1  t2,

as a more graphical denition, for a tree t, we consider
the path starting from the root and climbing up the tree
by taking, at each vertex, the right branch. this path
terminates at the extreme right leaf of the tree and goes
through n(t) + 2 vertices (including the root and the leaf).
for each vertex si along that path, excluding the root and
the leaf, we cut t into two trees ui and vi, where vi is the
subtree of t that has si as a root, and ui the subtree of t
that has si as a leaf. for example:

p ! =





.



this operation will help calculating the vacuum polar-

ization and the self-energy. if we dene y by

0(t) =

1

1/0()  y

,

x =xt

0() = 0,

it is proved in the appendix that y =pt 0(t), where
0(ui)0(vi)(cid:17). (26)

0()(cid:16)0(t)

0(t) =

0()

n(t)

xi=1

in this equation, ui, vi and n(t) are determined from t by
eq.(24).

7.1 vacuum polarization

from the general formula, we deduce that the vacuum
polarization is given, in terms of the map  for the full
photon propagator, by

(q) =xt

0
(t; q),

with 0(; q) = 0 and

(t; q)(q  m) 
(t; q) = (q  m)0

(q  m)

xi=1

 (u
0

i ; q)g 

 (v

i ; q).

incidentally, it can be noted that the full vacuum po-
larization  (q) is related to the fermion loop by (ref.[21]
p.477):

 (q) = ixt

e2|t|+2z

d4p

(2)4 tr(cid:2) 1(t; p; , q)(cid:3).

7.2 self-energy

(t1  ui)  vi

similarly, the self-energy is given, in terms of the map 
for the full fermion propagator, by

t2 6= .

(25)

(q) = xt

0(t; q),

with 0(; q) = 0 and

with

0(t; q) = (q  m)0(t; q)(q  m)

(q  m)

n(t)

xi=1

0(u

i ; q)0(vi; q).

from the formula for the self-energy, we can deduce
the complete one-particle irreducible three-point function
 (p, p) [21], p.335. we reintroduce the external potential
to write

(ix  m  ea(x))

(x, y; a) =xt
(t; x, y; a)(i
xt
xi=1z dz(ui; x, z; a)(vi; z, y; a),

(ix  m  ea(x))

n(t)

 y  m  ea(y)) 


 y acts on the left. in the real space,  (x, y; z)

where
is given

 (x, y; z) =

(x, y; a)

a(z)

for a = 0.

therefore,

 (x, y; z) =xt

e|t|+11(t; x, y; , z),

with

1(t; x, y; , z) = (z  x)0(t; x, y)(i

(ix  m)0(t; x, y)(z  y) +

xi=1z dz0(ui; x, z)1(vi; z, y; , z) 
xi=1z dz1(ui; x, z; , z)0(vi; z, y).

n(t)

in fourier space, this gives us

 (q, q + p) = xt

8 interaction with an external eld

in this section we come back to the original schwinger
equation, because the presence of an external source is
a convenient way to represent the nuclei in the qed of
matter.

starting from eq.(10), we multiply by the correspond-
ing bare green functions and we introduce a(x; j) into
the second equation to obtain

 (z, z)

s(x, y; j) = s0(x, y)  ez d4zd4zs0(x, z)d0
j (z)s(z, y; j)  ie2z d4zd4zs0(x, z)
(z, z)tr(cid:2)s(z, z; j)(cid:3)s(z, y; j) 
iez d4zs0(x, z) s(z, y; j)

j (z)

d0

.

(27)

here, the schwinger equation is a sum of three terms.
the rst term is simply the classical interaction with the
external source j  (z2), it can be solved by dening a bare
propagator in the presence of this source

s0(x, y; j)1 = i  m + ez d4zd0

(x, z)j (z).

equation (27) becomes now

s(x, y; j) = s0(x, y; j)  ie2z d4zd4zs0(x, z; j)
(z, z)tr(cid:2)s(z, z; j)(cid:3)s(z, y; j) 
iez d4zs0(x, z; j) s(z, y; j)

j (z)

d0

this equation is solved by the usual methods, and the

recursive denition of (t) is

where the last term is non zero only if t has the special
shape t =   t2.

according to schwinger [5], the full photon green func-
tion in the presence of an external current j is given by
the functional derivative of a(x; j) with respect to j(y).
therefore

d(x, y; j) = 

a(x; j)

(x, z)tr(cid:2)1(t; z, z; , y)(cid:3).

it is also possible to start directly from eq.(27) and to
write a tree solution of this equation using bare fermion
green functions. here, the strong eld case was treated
because it is probably more interesting for applications to
solid-state physics.

9 conclusion

a method was presented to write the solution of some
schwinger equations as a series over planar binary trees.
in quantum eld theory, it is common to expand over the
number of loops or to use integral equations relating, for
instance, the full propagator to the full vertex. the rst
method gives explicit results but becomes very complex,
and hundreds of diagrams must be built and calculated af-
ter the rst few terms of the perturbation expansion. the
second method is formally powerful but not very explicit
because an n-body green function is expressed in terms
of an unknown n + 1-body green function. the present
approach is a way to mix these two methods to obtain

an explicit recursive formula for the propagators and its
functional derivatives.

the main point of the method is that explicit recur-
sive expressions can be given for the solution of schwinger
equations. because of the recursive structure, the results
obtained at each step can be reused for the next step.

the present paper is only a rst exploration of the
method of series indexed by planar binary trees, and much
work remains to be done to explore its algebraic properties
and its applications.

two kinds of applications were presented here. on the
one hand, a series indexed by planar binary trees was given
for various physical quantities (full fermion and photon
propagators, full two-body green function), and a method
was given to deduce from this a series for vacuum polariza-
tion, fermion self-energy and irreducible vertex function.
although the formulas may be a bit cumbersome, they
are derived and proved easily. on the other hand, the re-
cursive nature of the terms of the series is well suited to
prove properties to all orders of perturbation theory. this
was done in the case of the ward-takahashi identities.

the present work can be expanded in various direc-
tions. other eld theories can be investigated, as well as
many-particle green functions. the present treatment was
restricted to classical electromagnetic sources, it could be
worthwile to study the case of anticommuting fermion
sources. furthermore, planar binary trees could be used
to solve the hedin equation [22] and investigate the gw-
approximation [23] of solid-state physics.

as a last point, it can be noticed that previous arti-
cles have presented general planar trees as the structure
adapted to quantum eld theory [24]. in fact, planar trees
and planar binary trees are equivalent for that purpose.
since the number of planar trees with n vertices is equal
to the number of planar binary trees with 2n  1 vertices
[7], there is a bijection  between planar trees and pla-
nar binary trees. if t is a planar tree, the bijection can be
realized recursively by, for example,  () =  and

 (b+(t)) =  (t)  ,

 (b+(t1, t2, . . . , tk)) =  (t1)   (b+(t2, . . . , tk)),

where b+ is the grafting operator dened by kreimer [1,
2] to build rooted trees. this bijection is also apparent in
the existence of two methods for the numerical solution of
dierential equations on lie groups: one based on planar
trees [25], the other on planar binary trees [26]. planar bi-
nary trees were chosen here because the recursive formulas
look simpler and because of the mathematical results of
loday, frabetti and collaborators.

11 appendix

if we symmetrize y in n+1, we obtain

this appendix contains proofs of some of the statements
contained in the text.

11.1 proof of eq.(8)

equation (8) will be proved in two steps. firstly, it will be
shown that if n(t) satises eq.(8), then n(t)
 (t),
secondly, that the sum over trees is a solution of eq.(3).

v = n+1

the rst step is to show that

n(t; {z}1,n)

v(y)

= n+1

 (t; y, {z}1,n).

(29)

this will be proved inductively. according to the construc-
tion of n() from the initial data a, the relation is true
for t = . now we assume that the relation is true up to
trees with 2n  1 vertices. let t be a tree with 2n + 1
vertices. the functional derivative of eq.(8) gives us

n(t; {z}1,n)

v(y)

=

n

xk=0

n

xk=0

k(t1; {z}1,k)

v(y)

,

f(cid:0)

nk+1


(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1) +

f(cid:0)k(t1; {z}1,k),

nk+1



(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)
v(y)

(cid:1).

since t1 and t2 have less vertices than t, relation (29) is
true for them and we obtain

n(t; {z}1,n)

v(y)

=

n

xk=0

n

xk=0

 (t1; y, {z}1,k),

f(cid:0)k+1

nk+1


(t2; z, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1) +

f(cid:0)k(t1; {z}1,k),

nk+2


(t2; y, z, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1), (30)

where k
(t; {z}1,k) distributes the variables z1 and z2
over the k positions z1, . . . , zk without changing the order
of z3, . . . , zk. all ways to take two number among k are
used, so it is clear that k
(t; z1, z2, . . . , zk) is symmetric
in z1, z2.

on the other hand, we know from eq.(8) that

n+1(t; y, {z}1,n) = f(cid:0)0(t1), n+2

f(cid:0)n+1(t1; y, {z}1,n), 1(t2; z)(cid:1) +
xk=1
f(cid:0)k(t1; y, {z}1,k1), nk+2

 (t2; z, y, {z}1,n)(cid:1) +
(t2; z, {z}k,n)(cid:1).

 (t; y, {z}1,n) = f(cid:0)0(t1), n+2

(t2; z)(cid:1) +
xk=1
f(cid:0)k
xk=1
f(cid:0)k(t1; {z}1,k), nk+2

 (t2; z, y, {z}1,n)(cid:1) +
(t2; z, {z}k,n)(cid:1) +
(t2; z, y, {z}k+1,n)(cid:1).

(t1; y, {z}1,k1), nk+2





n

comparing this with eq.(30), we see that the two expres-
sions are identical, and the property is proved for t.

if we denote by x the (formal) sum x = pt 0(t),
v(z) = pt 1(t; z). using

then from eq.(29) we obtain x
eq.(8) we can write

0(t),

x = xt
= 0() +xt6=

f (0(t1), 1(t2; z)).

at this point intervenes the essential property eq.(1) that
each tree dierent from  is generated in a unique way
by the grafting of two trees t1 and t2. the sum over t1
and t2, which are the branches of t, can be replaced by an
unrestricted sum over all trees t1 and t2. thus

f(cid:0)0(t1), 1(t2; z)(cid:1),
0(t1),xt2

1(t2; z)(cid:17),

x = 0() + xt1,t2
= 0() + f(cid:16)xt1
v(z)(cid:1).
= a + f(cid:0)x,

x

a small extension of the previous result is necessary
to treat the case of qed. the schwinger equation is now
x = a + af (x, x
where () is the usual initial data and the recurrence
relation becomes

v(z) ) and the solution is x = pt (t),

n

nk

n(t; {z}1,n) =

k(; {z}1,k)

xk=0

xk=0

(t1; {z}k+1,k+k ), nkk+1



f(cid:0)k

(t2; z, {z}k+k+1,n)(cid:1).

the reasoning is the same as for the simple schwinger
equation. we start by proving that n(t)
 (t). this
is done by using the recursive denition of  to write
both sides in terms of (t1) and (t2). then we write

v = n+1

x = pt 0(t) and we show that, because of the recur-

rence relation for , it satises x = a + af (x, x

in this paper, the treatment was restricted to linear
integral operators f . however, the method can treat other
cases. for instance, if f depends on x 2, this square can
be, in some sense, linearized by the planar trees. if x =

v(z) ).

where 0(t) (and more generally n(t)) is dened by

n() = 0
n

n(t) =

xk=0

k(t1)nk(t2).

let x(s) = 1 +pt6= s|t|(t). let us show that the series
for y (s) = 1  1/x(s) is given by y (s) = pt6= s|t|(t),

where (t) is dened by eq.(26).

the rst step is to prove that, if p (t) is dened by

eq.(25), then, with an abuse of notation,

p (yn) =

n1

xk=1

yk  ynk,

(32)

11.2 proof of eq.(9)

or more precisely

equation (9) will be proved by two methods. both are
fast and easy. in the rst method, we dene a schwinger
equation

p (t) =

x|t|=n

n1

xk=1(cid:16) x|u|=k

u(cid:17) (cid:16) x|v|=nk

v(cid:17).

(cid:18)x
z(cid:19) =(cid:18)a

0(cid:19) + h(cid:18)x
y(cid:19),

where

(31)

as usually, this will be proved recursively. the property
is true for n = 2, because

h(cid:18)x

z(cid:19) =(cid:18)

f(cid:0)x, x
v(z)(cid:1)
g(cid:0)x + z, x

v(z) + z

v(z)(cid:1)(cid:19).

this is a schwinger equation whose solution is given

p (

) = 0, p (

) =



.

	

.





if this is true up to n, then, from eq.(1)

by eq.(8), where the map is

(cid:19)(t) =
(cid:18)


which is eq.(9).



pn
k=0 f(cid:0)k(t1), nk+1
(t2)(cid:1)
pn
k=0 g(cid:0)k(t1) + k(t1),
(t2)(cid:1)

(t2) + nk+1

nk+1





 ,

p (t) =

x|t|=n+1

n

xk=0 x|t1|=k x|t2|=nk

p (t1  t2)

by denition (25),

the upper component of eq.(31) is the rst schwinger
equation x = a + f (x, x
v(z) ). if we write y = x + z,
the lower component is y = x + g(y, y
v(z) ). therefore,
x + z is the solution of the composition of equations. the
map corresponding to this solution is (t) = (t) + (t).
the second proof can also be useful. it starts by adding
a parameter s to the schwinger equations: x(s) = a +
sf (x(s), x(s)
v(z) ). we
take the n-th derivative of y with respect to s, and we
write y (n) for its value at s = 0. the chain rule gives

v(z) ) and y (s) = x(s) + sg(y (s), y (s)

p (t) =

x|t|=n+1

n

xk=1 x|t1|=k x|t2|=nk
xk=2 x|t1|=k x|t2|=nk

n

(t1  )  t2 +

n(t2)

xi=1

(t1  ui)  vi.

we use property (32) in the right-hand side :

n

y (n) = x (n) + n

n

xk=0(cid:18)n  1

k (cid:19)g(cid:0)y (k),

xk=m+1 x|t1|=nk
xm=1

n

(t1  )  t2 +

(t1  ykm)  ym.

it can be shown recursively that

y (n) = n! x|t|=n(cid:0)0(t) + 0(t)(cid:1),

where  satises eq.(9). the result follows by expanding
x(s) and y (s) as power series of s and taking its value
for s = 1.
