abstract

the possibility of non-trivial representations of the gauge group on wavefunc-
tionals of a gauge invariant quantum eld theory leads to a generation of mass
for intermediate vector and tensor bosons. the mass parameters m show up as
central charges in the algebra of constraints, which then become of second-class
nature. the gauge group coordinates acquire dynamics outside the null-mass
shell and provide the longitudinal eld degrees of freedom that massless bosons
need to form massive bosons. this is a non-higgs mechanism that could pro-
vide new clues for the best understanding of the symmetry breaking mechanism
in unied eld theories. a unied quantization of massless and massive non-
abelian yang-mills, linear gravity and abelian two-form gauge eld theories are
fully developed from this new approach, where a cohomological origin of mass is
pointed out.

keywords: algebraic and geometric quantization, group cohomology, constraints.

1 introduction

in this paper we discuss a new approach to quantum gauge theories, from a group-theoretic
perspective, in which mass enters the theory in a natural way. more precisely, the presence
of mass will manifest through non-trivial responses u = d(m)
(u) of the wavefunctional
 under the action of gauge transformations u  t , where we denote by d(m)

representation of the gauge group t with index m. the standard case d(m)
(u) = 1 , u 
t corresponds to the well-known gauss law condition, which also reads xa = 0 for
innitesimal gauge transformations u  1 + axa. the case of abelian representations
d()
t (un) = ein of t , where n denotes the winding number of un, leads to the well-known
-vacuum phenomena. we shall see that more general (non-abelian) representations d(m)
t
of the gauge group t entail non-equivalent quantizations (in the sense of, e.g. [1, 2]) and
a generation of mass.

t

this non-trivial response of  under gauge transformations u causes a deformation of
the corresponding lie-algebra commutators and leads to the appearance of central terms
proportional to mass parameters (eventually parametrizing the non-equivalent quantiza-
tions) in the algebra of constraints, which then become a mixture of rst- and second-class
constraints. as a result, extra (internal) eld degrees of freedom emerge out of second-
class constraints and are transferred to the gauge potentials to conform massive bosons
(without higgs elds!).

thus, the classical case d(m)

t = 1 is not in general preserved in passing to the quantum
theory. upon quantization, rst-class constraints (connected with a gauge invariance of
the classical system) might become second-class, a metamorphosis which is familiar when
quantizing anomalous gauge theories. quantum anomalies change the picture of physi-
cal states being singlets under the constraint algebra. anomalous (unexpected) situations
generally go with the standard viewpoint of quantizing classical systems; however, these
breakdowns, which sometimes are inescapable obstacles for canonical quantization, could
be reinterpreted as normal (even essential) situations in a wider setting. dealing with
constraints directly in the quantum arena, this transmutation in the nature of constraints
should be naturally allowed, as it provides new richness to the quantum theory.

a formalism which intends to place the familiar correspondence (canonical) rules of
quantum mechanics, q  q, p  p = ih 
q , within a rigorous frame is geometric quan-
tization (gq) [3]. the basic idea in this formalism is that the quantum theory should be
an irreducible representation of the poisson algebra of observables of the classical phase
space. however, it is well known that this program cannot be fully executed because tech-
nical obstructions arise, mainly due to ordering problems (see, for example, [4, 5]). some
of these limitations can be avoided by replacing the phase-space manifold by a group,
which is the spirit of the group approach to quantization (gaq) program [6]. needless
to say, the requirement of an underlying group structure represent some drawback, al-
though less, in practice, than it might seem. after all, any consistent (non-perturbative)
quantization is nothing other than a unitary irreducible representation of a suitable (lie,
poisson) algebra. also, constrained quantization (see below and refs.
[7, 8]) increases
the range of applicability of the formalism. nonetheless, we should remark that the gaq
formalism, which is at heart an operator description of a quantum system, is not meant to
quantize a classical system (a phase space), but rather a quantizing group g is the primary
object. even more, in some cases (anomalous groups [9, 10, 11], for example), it is unclear
how to associate a denite classical phase space with the quantum theory obtained, thus
weakening the notion itself of classical limit. furthermore, this cohomological mechanism

2

of mass-generation makes perfect sense from the gaq framework and we are going to use
its concepts and tools to work out the quantization of vector and tensor potentials.

quantizing on a group requires the revision of some standard concepts, such as gauge
transformations, in order to deal properly with them. the meaning of gauge transforma-
tions in quantum mechanics is not well understood at present (see, for example, [12]);
thus, a reexamination of it is timely.

in a previous article [13], a revision of the traditional concept of gauge transformation

for the electromagnetic vector potential,

(x)  (x) + (x), a(x)  a(x)  (x) ,

(1)

was necessary to arrange this transformation inside a group law; that is, to adapt this
operation to an action of a group on itself: the group law of the (innite-dimensional)
electromagnetic quantizing group g. the proposed lie group g had a principal bundle
structure g  g/ t and was parameterized, roughly speaking, by the coordinates a(~x, t)
of the abelian subgroup ga of lie-algebra valued vector potentials, the coordinates v =
(y, ) (space-time translations and lorentz transformations) of the poincare group p
and the coordinates (x) of the local group t  map(4, u(1)), which took part of the
structure group t  t  u(1) and generalized the standard u(1)-phase invariance,  
ei, in quantum mechanics. in this way, the extra t -equivariance conditions on wave
functions [complex valued functions (g) on g], i.e. (gt  g)  (g), g  g, gt  t ,
provided the traditional constraints of the theory (we denote by  the composition law of
g).

the above-mentioned revision was motivated by the fact that the transformation (1)
is not compatible with a quantizing group g. in fact, the general property g e = eg = g
for a composition law g = g  g of a group g (e denotes the identity element), precludes
the existence of linear terms, in the group law gj = gj(gk, gl) of a given parameter
gj of g, other than gj and gj; that is, near the identity we have gj = gj + gj + o(2)
in canonical coordinates. therefore, the group law for the eld parameter a cannot
have linear terms in . the natural way to address this situation is just to choose
a  a  , which stays unchanged under gauge transformations, and change the
phase  = ei of the quantum-mechanical wave functional (a) accordingly, as follows:

(x)  (x) + (x), a(x)  a(x),

of the electromagnetic quantizing group g (see below and ref. [13] for more details).

it is worth mentioning that the required review of the concepts of gauge transforma-
tions and constraint conditions to construct the quantizing group g has led, as a byprod-
uct, to a unied quantization of both the electromagnetic and proca elds [13], within the
same general scheme of quantization based on a group (gaq) [6]; clearly, a unied scheme
of quantization for massless and massive gauge theories is suitable as an alternative to
the standard spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism, which is intended to supply
mass whereas preserving renormalizability. on the other hand, the standard (classical)
transformation (1) is regained as the trajectories associated with generalized equations
of motion generated by vector elds with null noether invariants (gauge subalgebra, see
refs. [13, 14] and below).

this particular revision also applies for the non-abelian case (yang-mills potentials),
and for gravity itself, as they are gauge theories. however, for these cases, the situation
seems to be a little more subtle and complicated. the goal of this article is to present
a (non-perturbative) group approach to quantization of non-abelian gauge theories and
to point out a cohomological origin of mass, as a consequence of a new look to gauge
transformations and constraints. furthermore, although a proper group formulation of
a quantum theory of gravity is beyond the scope of this article, the corresponding lin-
earized version of this theory can be a useful model to work out, as a preliminary step
towards the more complicated, non-linear case. even more so, some two-dimensional toy
models of quantum gravity, such as string inspired or bf theories [15], also admit a group
formulation similar to the non-abelian yang-mills theories.

the organization of the present paper is the following. in sec. 2, a quantizing group
g for linear gravity and abelian two-form gauge theories (symmetric and anti-symmetric
tensor potentials, respectively) is oered. this simple example contains most of the
essential elements of more general cases to which gaq is applied and we shall make use of
it to explain the method; the structure and nature of constraints, the count of eld degrees
of freedom, the hilbert space and the physical operators of these theories is presented,

4

for the massless and massive cases, in a unied manner. in sec. 3, a quantizing group
for general, non-abelian yang-mills gauge theories is proposed; the full quantization is
then performed inside the gaq framework, and the connection with other approaches to
quantization is given; also, non-trivial representations of the gauge group t are connected
with the -vacuum phenomenon and with mass generation for yang-mills vector elds;
this is a non-higgs mechanism which can provide new clues for the best understanding
of the nature of the symmetry-breaking mechanism. finally, sec. 4 is devoted to some
comments, conclusions and outlooks.

and abelian two-form gauge theories, respectively. these theories have a gauge freedom

the rst cocycle 1 is meant to provide dynamics to the tensor potential, so that the
couple (a(), a()) corresponds to a canonically-conjugate pair of variables; the second
cocycle 2, the mixed cocycle, provides a non-trivial (non-diagonal) action of constraints
on tensor potentials and determines the number of degrees of freedom of the constrained
theory [it is also responsible for the transformation appearing in the second line of (7)];
the third cocycle 3, the mass cocycle, determines the structure of constraints (rst- or
second-class) and modies the dynamical content of the tensor potential coordinates a()
in the massive case m 6= 0 by transferring degrees of freedom between the a() and ()
coordinates, thus conforming the massive eld. in this way, the appearance of mass in
the theory has a cohomological origin. to make more explicit the intrinsic signicance
of these three quantities j , j = 1, 2, 3, let us construct the quantum theory of these
(anti-)symetric tensor potentials for the massless and massive cases in a unied manner,
the physical interpretation of which will be a free theory of massless and massive spin 2
particles (gravitons) for the symmetric case, and a free theory of massless spin 0 pseudo-
scalar particles, and massive spin 1 pseudo-vector particles for the anti-symmetric case.
the starting point will be the tensor quantizing group g() = {g = (a(), (), v; )}

with group law g = g  g, which can be explicitly written as:

v = v  v ,

they are explicitly (for simplicity, we discard the lorentz subgroup):

the representation lg(g) = (gg) of g on wave functions  proves to be reducible.
the reduction can be achieved by means of those right-conditions rg(g) = (g  g) 
(g) (which commute with the left-action l) compatible with the above u(1)-equivariant
condition  = i, i.e., by means of the so-called polarization conditions x l = 0 [6].
roughly speaking, a polarization corresponds to a maximal left-subalgebra gp of the lie
algebra gl of g which exclude the central generator ; or, in other words, a maximal,
horizontal left-subalgebra gp. the horizontality property for a subalgebra gh =< x l
gj >
can be formally stated as ( x l
gj  gh , where we denote by  the vertical
component l() [dual to  = i x l
gj ] of the standard canonical
(lie-valued) left-invariant 1-form l of g. it can be easily calculated from the general
expression:

for cases such as the centrally-extended galilei group [6], the so called quantization 1-
form  reduces to the poincare-cartan form of classical mechanics, p c = pdq  p2
2m dt,

dgj  i 1d .

(14)

except for the (typically quantum) phase term i 1d. in the same way as p c, the
quantization 1-form  gives the generalized classical equations of motion of the system.
the trajectories for (14) are given by the integral curves of the characteristic module
ker  kerd = {vector elds x / ( x) = 0, d( x) = 0} of the presymplectic (in gen-
eral, it has a non-trivial kernel) two-form d on the group g. the characteristic module
of  is generated by the characteristic subalgebra gc, which includes non-symplectic (non-
dynamical) generators; that is, horizontal left-invariant vector elds which, under com-
mutation, do not give rise to central terms proportional to  (i.e., they do not have any
conjugated counterpart). in fact, d at the identity of the group regains the lie-algebra
cocycle :

  d|e : gl  gl   , (x l

a , x l

b ) = d(x l

a , x l

b )|e = (h x l

a horizontal ideal of the whole lie algebra g of g (a normal horizontal subgroup n for

combination of the corresponding left-invariant vector elds. in fact, the coecients of
this linear combination provide a representation of the complement of ggauge in gc (in this
case, the poincare subalgebra). all these properties characterize a gauge subgroup of g.

is not a horizontal ideal but, rather, t is itself a quantizing group [more precisely, a central
extension of t by u(1)] with its own quantization 1-form  t . first-class constraints will
be dened as the characteristic subalgebra tc of t with respect to  t . second-class
constaints are dened as the complement of tc in t , and can be arranged into couples
of conjugated generators. the constrained hilbert space hphys. will be made of complex
wave functionals (11) which are annihilated

x r

gtphys. = 0,  x r

gt  tp

(20)

by a polarization subalgebra tp  t of right-invariant vector elds, which contains tc
and half of second-class constraints (the, let us say, positive modes). the algebra tp is
then the maximal right-subalgebra of t that can be consistently imposed to be zero on
wavefunctionals as constraint equations. the condition (20) selects those wave functionals
phys. which transform as highest weight vectors under t .

since constraint conditions (20) are imposed as innitesimal right-restictions (nite
left-restrictions), it is obvious that not all the operators x r will preserve the constraints;
we shall call ggood  gr the subalgebra of (goodphysical) operators which do so. these
have to be found inside the normalizer of the constraints; for example, a sucient condi-
tion for ggood to preserve the constraints is:

h ggood, tpi  tp .

(21)

from this characterization, we see that rst-class constraints tc become a horizontal ideal
(a gauge subalgebra) of ggood, which now denes the constrained theory. even more, it
can be proved that gauge generators (17) are trivial (zero) on polarized wave functions
(see later).

with all this information at hand, let us go back to the reduction process of the repre-
sentation (11). an operative method to obtain a full polarization subalgebra gp is to com-
plete the characteristic subalgebra gc to a maximal, horizontal left-subalgebra. roughly
speaking, gp will include non-symplectic generators in gc and half of the symplectic ones
(either positions or momenta). the above-mentioned polarization conditions

(22)

[or its nite counterparts rgp(g) = (g)] represent the generalized quantum equations
of motion; for example, x l
y0 = 0 represents the schrodinger equation. in this way, the
concept of polarization here generalizes the analogous one in geometric quantization [3],
where no characteristic module exists (since all variables are symplectic). the content of

9

gp will depend on the value of k2, as also happens for tp. from now on we shall distinguish
between the cases k2 = 0 and k2 = m2 6= 0, and between symmetric and antis-ymmetric
tensor potentials, placing each one in separate subsections. let us see how to obtain the
corresponding constrained hilbert space and the action of the physical operators on wave
functions.

g(k2 6= 0): massive tensor elds

as mentioned above, a remarkable characteristic of the quantizing group law (10) is that
it accomplishes the quantization of both the massless and massive cases, according to the
value of the central extension parameter m in the third cocycle of (9), in a unied way.
the modication of ()
in the m 6= 0 case causes a transfer of degrees of freedom between
the a() and () coordinates, so that it is possible to decouple the tensor potential by
means of a transformation which diagonalizes the cocycle (). in fact, the combinations:

of degrees of freedom between the a() and f () coordinates for the massive case, leading
to a new set of variables, b() and (), which correspond to a massive (anti-)symmetric
tensor eld and some sort of vector eld with negative energy.

for the present massive case, all constraints are second-class for the symmetric case,
since they close an electromagnetic-like subalgebra [see third line of eq. (13)], whereas,
for the anti-symmetric case, constraints close a proca-like subalgebra which leads to three
couples of second-class constraints, { j()
} j = 1, 2, 3, and a couple of
gauge vector elds {k x r

subalgebra tp of t ) eliminate the () dependence of wave functions in (33) and keep
6 = 10  4 eld degrees of freedom for the symmetric case (massive spin 2 particle
+ massive scalar eld=trace of the symmetric tensor), and 3 = 6  3 eld degrees of
freedom for the anti-symmetric case (massive pseudo-vector particle).

3 group approach to quantization of non-abelian

yang-mills theories

once we know how gaq works on abelian gauge eld theories, let us tackle the non-
abelian case, the underlying structure of which is similar to the previous case. however,
new richness and subtle distinctions are introduced because of the non-abelian character
of the constraint subgroup t = map(4, t) = {u(x) = ea(x)t a}, where t is some non-
abelian, compact lie-group with lie-algebra commutation relations [t a, t b] = c ab

c t c.

as for the abelian case, the traditional gauge transformation properties,

u(x)  u (x)u(x) , a(x)  u (x)a(x)u (x)1 + u (x)u (x)1,

(34)

for lie-algebra valued vector potentials a(x) = rb
a denotes a coupling-
constant matrix) have to be revised in order to adapt it to an action of a group on
itself. the solution for this is to consider a  a  uu 1, which transforms homo-
geneously under the adjoint action of t , whereas the non-tensorial part u (x)u (x)1
modies the phase  of the wavefunctional  according to:

b (x)t a (rb

aa

u(x)  u (x)u(x) , a(x)  u (x)a(x)u (x)1 ,

   exp(cid:26) i

r2 z

d(x) trhu (x)1u (x)




a(x)i(cid:27) ,

(35)

where we are restricting ourselves, for the sake of simplicity, to special unitary groups
t, so that the structure constants c ab
c are totally anti-symmetric, and the anti-hermitian
generators t a can be chosen such that the killing-cartan metric is just tr(t at b) =  1
2 ab.
for simple groups, the coupling-constant matrix rb
a reduces to a multiple of the identity
rb
a = rb

in (35) can be considered to be a piece of a two-cocycle  : g  g   constructed

through a conserved current, (g|g) = r d(x)j (g|g)(x), g, g  g, so that it does

not depend on the chosen spacelike hypersurface . let us also discard the poincare
subgroup p in the group g; that is, we shall consider, roughly speaking, g = ga s t ,
i.e. the semidirect product of the abelian group ga of lie-valued vector potentials and
the group t . the reason for so doing is something more than a matter of symplicitly. in
fact, we could make the kinematics (p ) and the constraints (t ) compatible at the price
of introducing an innite number of extra generators in the enveloping algebra of ga, in
a way that makes the quantization procedure quite unwieldy. we could also introduce
a free-like (abelian) kinematics without the need for extra generators at the price of
appropriately adjusting the constraint set and the kinematics into a stable system, that
is, by introducing secondary constraints. nevertheless, unlike other standard approaches
to quantum mechanics, gaq still holds, even in the absence of a well-dened (space-)time
evolution, an interesting and desirable property concerning the quantization of gravity
(see, for example, [20]). the true dynamics [which preserves the constraints (11)] will
eventually arise as part of the set of good operators of the theory (see below).

we shall adopt a non-covariant approach and choose a t = constant -hypersurface
to write the cocycle . also, we shall make partial use of the gauge freedom to set the
temporal component a0 = 0, so that the electric eld is simply ~ea = 0 ~aa [from now
on, and for the sake of simplicity, we shall put any three-vector ~a as a, and we will
j=1 ajej, in the hope that no confusion will arise]. in this case, there

is still a residual gauge invariance t = map(3, t) (see [21]).

understand ae = p3

taking all of this into account, the explicit group law g = g  g [with g = (g; ) =

(a, e, u; )] for the proposed innite-dimensional yang-mills quantizing group g is:

u (x) = u (x)u(x) ,
a(x) = a(x) + u (x)a(x)u (x)1 ,
e(x) = e(x) + u (x)e(x)u (x)1 ,

it is noteworthy that, unlike the abelian case t = map(4, u(1)), the simple (and non-
abelian) character of t for the present case precludes a non-trivial central extension

14

t of t by u(1) given by the cocycle 3 [see (9)]. however, mass will enter the non-
abelian yang-mills theories through pseudo-cocycles [in fact, coboundaries (g|g) =
(g  g)  (g)  (g), where (g) is the generating function (of the coboundary)]
with mass parameters a = m3
a, which dene trivial extensions as such, but provide new
commutation relations in the lie algebra of g and alter the number of degrees of freedom
of the theory (see below). to make more explicit the intrinsic signicance of the two
quantities j , j = 1, 2, let us calculate the non-trivial lie-algebra commutators of the
right-invariant vector elds from the group law (36). they are explicitly:

and x r

let us construct the hilbert space of the theory. as already mentioned, the rep-
resentation lg(g) = (g  g) of g on t -equivariant wave functions (11) proves to
be reducible. the reduction is achieved by means of polarization conditions (22) which
contain nite right-transformations generated by left-invariant vector elds x l devoid of
dynamical content (that is, without a canonically conjugated counterpart), and half of the
left-invariant vector elds related to dynamical coordinates (either positions or mo-
menta). the left-invariant vector elds without a canonically conjugated counterpart
are the combinations

as for the abelian case, the ow of (39) recovers the time-independent (residual) trans-
formation (34).

the characteristic subalgebra gc can be completed to a full polarization subalgebra

gp in two dierent ways:

p < gc, x l
g(a)

ab b >, g(e)

p < gc, x l

eb b >,

(40)

each one giving rise to a dierent representation space: a) the electric eld representation

functions are:

where a and e are arbitrary functionals of e and a  a + uu 1, respectively. the
trivial bration of t = t u(1) for the massless case allows us to impose the whole tp = t
t = (0, 0, u ; 1)  t on wavefunctionals.

(42)

which are the nite counterpart of the innitesimal, quantum implementation of the gauss
law x r
a(x) = i ga(x) = 0. the polarized and constrained wavefunctionals (41,42)
dene the constrained hilbert space hphys( g) of the theory, and the innitesimal form
g (g) of the nite left-action lg(g) of g on h( g) provides the action of the operators
x r
aa, ea, ga on wave functions (see [22] for more details).

the good operators ggood for this case have to be found inside the right-enveloping
algebra u( gr) of polynomials of the basic operators aa(x), eb(x), as forming part of the
normalizer of t (see eq. (21)). in particular, some good operators are:

ggood =< tr[ ej(x) bk(x)], tr[ ej(x) ek(x)], tr[ bj(x) bk(x)],  > ,

(43)

ab ac (the magnetic eld) can be interpreted as a correction

to aa that, unlike aa, transforms homogeneously under the adjoint action of t [see
2nd line of (37)]. the components (x) of the standard canonical energy-momentum
tensor for yang-mills theories are linear combinations of operators in (43); for example,
00(x) = tr[e2(x) + b2(x)] is the hamiltonian density. in this way, poincare invariance
is retrieved in the constrained theory.

let us mention, for the sake of completeness, that the actual use of good operators is
not restricted to rst- and second-order operators. higher-order operators can constitute
a useful tool in nding the whole constrained hilbert space hphys( g). in fact, it can be
obtained from a constrained (physical) state (0), i.e. ga(0) = 0, on which the energy-
momentum tensor has null expectation value h(0)| |(0)i = 0, by taking the orbit
of the rest of good operators passing through this vacuum. this has been indeed a
rather standard technique (the verma module approach) in theories where null vector
states are present in the original hilbert space [23, 24, 11]. from an other point of view,

space, are good operators related to wilson loops.

with regard to connement, exponentials of the form 2  trhexp(jklr2 djk el)i and
2  trhexp(jklr2 djk bl)i, where 2 is a two-dimensional surface in three-dimensional
as a previous step before examining the massive case, let us show how new physics
can enter the theory by considering non-trivial representations d()
t of t or, in an equiva-
lent way, by introducing certain extra coboundaries in the group law (36). indeed, more

16

general representations for the constraint subgroup t , namely the one-dimensional repre-
sentation d()
t (u) = eiu , can be considered if we impose additional boundary conditions
like u(x) x i; this means that we compactify the space 3  s3, so that the group
t fall into disjoint homotopy classes {ul , ul
= l} labelled by integers l  z = 3(t)
(the third homotopy group). the index  (the -angle [19]) parametrizes non-equivalent
quantizations, as the bloch momentum  does for particles in periodic potentials, where
the wave function acquires a phase (q + 2) = ei(q) after a translation of, let us say,
2. the phenomenon of non-equivalent quantizations can also be reproduced by keeping
the constraint condition d()
t (u) = 1, as in (42), at the expense of introducing a new
(pseudo) cocycle  which is added to the previous cocycle  = 1 + 2 in (36). the

generating function of  is (g) = r d3x c0(x), where c0 is the temporal component of

the chern-simons secondary characteristic class

c = 

1
162 tr(fa 

2
3

aaa) ,

(44)

which is the vector whose divergence equals the pontryagin density p = c =  1
162 tr
(f f) (see [21], for instance). like some total derivatives (namely, the pontryagin
density), which do not modify the classical equations of motion when added to the la-
grangian but have a non-trivial eect in the quantum theory, the coboundaries  give rise
to non-equivalent quantizations parametrized by  when the topology of the space is af-
fected by the imposition of certain boundary conditions (compactication of the space),
even though they are trivial cocycles of the unconstrained theory. the phenomenon of
non-equivalent quantizations can also be understood sometimes as a aharonov-bohm-like
eect (an eect experienced by the quantum particle but not by the classical particle) and
(g) = (g)
gj gj can be seen as an induced gauge connection (see [8] for the example of a
superconducting ring threaded by a magnetic ux) which modify the momenta according
to minimal coupling.

there exist other kind of coboundaries generated by functions (g) with non-trivial
gradient (g)|g=e 6= 0 at the identity g = e, which provide a contribution to the con-
nection form of the theory (14) and the structure constants of the original lie algebra
(37). we shall call these pseudo-cocycles, since they give rise to pseudo-cohomology classes
related with coadjoint orbits of semisimple groups [10]. whereas coboundaries generated
by global functions on the original (innite-dimensional) group g having trivial gradient
at the identity, namely , contribute the quantization with global (topological) eects,
pseudo-cocycles can give dynamics to some non-dynamical operators and provide new
couples of conjugated eld operators, thus substantially modifying the theory. let us
see how, in fact, the possibility of non-abelian representations of t is equivalent to the
introduction of new pseudo-cocycles in the centrally extended group law (36).

17

3.1 cohomological origin of mass and alternatives to the higgs

mechanism

non-trivial transformations of the wavefunctional  under the action of t can also be
reproduced by considering the pseudo-cocycle

(g|g)  2z d3x tr[ (log(u u)  log u   log u)] ,

(45)

which is generated by (g) = 2r d3x tr[ log u], where  = at a is a matrix carrying

some parameters a (with mass-cubed dimension) which actually characterize the repre-
sentation of g. however, unlike , this pseudo-cocycle (whose generating function  has
a non-trivial gradient at the identity g = e) alters the lie-algebra commutators of t and
leads to the appearance of new central terms at the right-hand side of the last line of eq.
(37). more explicitly:

a(x), x r
h x r

b(y)i = c ab

c (x  y) x r

c(x)  c ab

c

c
r2 (x  y) .

(46)

the appearance of new central terms proportional to the parameter c at the right-hand
side of (46) restricts the number of vector elds in the characteristic subalgebra (38),
which now consists of

gc =< x l

a / c ab

c c 6= 0 b >

(47)

(that is, the subalgebra of non-dynamical generators), with respect to the case c = 0,
where gc is isomorphic to t . therefore, the pseudo-cocycle  provide new degrees of
freedom to the theory; that is, new pairs of generators ( x r
c c 6= 0, become
conjugated and, therefore, new basic eld operators enter the theory. let us see how these
new degrees of freedom are transfered to the vector potentials to conform massive vector
bosons with mass cubed m3

b), with c ab

a, x r

a = a.

a, ej

in order to count the number of degrees of freedom for a given structure subgroup
t and a given mass matrix , let us denote by  = dim(t) and c = dim(gc) the
dimensions of the rigid subgroup of t and the characteristic subgroup gc, respectively.
in general, for an arbitrary mass matrix , we have c   . unpolarized, u(1)-equivariant
functions (aj
a, a) depend on n = 2  3 +  eld coordinates in d = 3 spatial
dimensions; polarization equations introduce p = c+ nc
independent restrictions on wave
2
funtions, corresponding to c non-dynamical coordinates in gc and half of the dynamical
ones; nally, constraints provide q = c +  c
additional restrictions which leave f =
2
n  p  q = 3  c eld degrees of freedom (in d = 3). indeed, for the massive case,
constraints are second-class and we can only impose a polarization subalgebra tp  t ,
c c = 0 b > t (which is
which contains a characteristic subalgebra tc =< x r
isomorphic to gc) and half of the rest of generators in t (excluding ); that is, q =
c +  c
2   independent constraints which lead to constrained wave functions having
support on fm6=0 = 2c+3( c)  fm=0 arbitrary elds corresponding to c massless vector
bosons attached to tc and  c massive vector bosons. in particular, for the massless case
we have tc = t , i.e. c =  , since constraints are rst-class (that is, we can impose q = 

a / c ab

18

restrictions) and constrained wave functions have support on fm=0 = 3   = 2  fm6=0
arbitrary elds corresponding to  massless vector bosons. the subalgebra tc corresponds
to the unbroken gauge symmetry of the constrained theory and proves to be an ideal of
ggood [remember the characterization of good operators before eq. (43)].

let us work out a couple of examples. cartan (maximal abelian) subalgebras of t
will be privileged as candidates for the unbroken electromagnetic gauge symmetry. thus,
let us use the cartan basis < hi, e > instead of < t a >, and denote {i, } the
coordinates of t attached to this basis (i.e.  are complex eld coordinates attached
to each root  and i are real eld coordinates attached to the maximal torus of t).
for t = map(3, su(2)) and  = 1h1, the characteristic, polarization and constraint

thus, the constrained theory corresponds to a self-interacting theory of two massless

summarizing, new basic operators g  x r

good operators ci = {casimir operators of t } (i runs the range of t) enter the theory,

operator is

also, the hamiltonian density 00(x) = tr [e2(x) + b2(x)] for m = 0 is aected in
the massive case m 6= 0 by the presence of extra terms proportional to these non-trivial
casimir operators (which are zero on constrained wave functionals in the massless case),

4 conclusions and outlooks

we have seen how the appearance of (quantum) central terms in the lie-algebra of sym-
metry of gauge theories provides new degrees of freedom which are transferred to the
potentials to conform massive bosons. thus, the appearance of mass seems to have a
cohomological origin, beyond any introduction of extra (higgs) particles. nevertheless,
the introduction of mass through the pseudo-cocycle  is equivalent to the choice of a
vacuum in which some generators of the unbroken gauge symmetry tc have a non-zero
expectation value proportional to the mass parameter (see [22]). this fact reminds us of
the higgs mechanism in non-abelian gauge theories, where the higgs elds point to the
direction of the non-null vacuum expectation values. however, the spirit of this standard
approach to supply mass and the one explained in this paper are radically dierent, even
though they have some characteristics in common. in fact, we are not making use of extra
scalar elds in the theory to provide mass to the vector bosons, but it is the gauge group
itself which acquires dynamics for the massive case and transfers degrees of freedom to
the vector potentials.

it is also worth devoting some words with regard to renormalizability for the case of a
non-trivial mass matrix  6= 0. obviously we should refer to nitness simply, since we are
dealing with a non-perturbative formulation. but the major virtue of a group-theoretic
algorithm is that we automatically arrive at normal-ordered, nite quantities, and this is
true irrespective of the breaking of the symmetry. we must notice that when we use
the term unbroken gauge symmetry, in referring to tc, we mean only that this subgroup
of t is devoid of dynamical content; the gauge group of the constrained theory is, in both
the massless and massive cases, the group t = t /u(1) although, for the massive case,
only a polarization subgroup tp can be consistently imposed as a constraint. this is also
the case of the virasoro algebra

[ ln, lm] = (n  m) ln+m +

1
12

(cn3  cn)n,m1 ,

(52)

in string theory, where the appearance of central terms does not spoil gauge invariance
but forces us to impose half of the virasoro operators only (the positive modes ln0) as
constraints. in general, although dieomorphisms usually appear as a constriant algebra
under which one might expect all the physical states to be singlets, dealing with them in
the quantum arena, the possibility of central extensions should be naturally allowed and
welcomed, as they provide new richness to the theory.

pseudo-cocycles similar to  do also appear in the representation of kac-moody
and conformally invariant theories in general, although the pseudo-cocycle parameters
are usually hidden in a redenition of the generators involved in the pseudo-extension
(the argument of the lie-algebra generating function). for the virasoro algebra, the
redenition of the l0 generator produces a non-trivial expectation value in the vacuum
h  (c  c)/24 [11].

fermionic matter can also be incorporated into the theory through extra (dirac elds)

20

coordinates l(x), l = 1, . . . , p and an extra two-cocycle

matter = iz d3x (cid:16) 0(u )  (u 1)0(cid:17) ,

(53)

where (u) is a p-dimensional representation of t acting on the column vectors , and
0 is the time component of the standard dirac matrices  (see [22] for more details).
