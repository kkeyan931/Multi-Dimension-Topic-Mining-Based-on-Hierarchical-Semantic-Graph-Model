abstract

the high temperature limit of a system of two d-0 branes is investigated.

the partition function can be expressed as a power series in  (inverse temper-

ature). the leading term in the high temperature expression of the partition

function and eective potential is calculated exactly. physical quantities like

the mean square separation can also be exactly determined in the high tem-

perature limit.

1. introduction

the study of string theory at nite temperature has received renewed attention recently

[217]. in a recent paper one of us [2] attempted to elucidate the nature of the hagedorn

transition [1] using the matrix model and found similarities with the deconnement transition

in gauge theories. this was also investigated in a subsequent paper using the ads/cft

correspondence [3]. it is clear that recent developments in non-perturbative string theory or

m-theory [1822] have some bearing on our understanding of the high temperature behavior

of strings. furthermore, study of high temperature behavior of a system is often a useful

probe of the system because many calculations simplify at high temperature. we can thus

hope to learn something about m-theory from its high temperature behavior. with this

motivation, in this paper, we attempt to study the high temperature behavior of a simple

but non-trivial system - the system of two d-0-branes. this is essentially the bfss matrix

model [19] with n=2. this is not big enough to describe m-theory. in particular it would

not include for instances processes involving pair-production of d-0 brane - anti-d-0 brane.

nevertheless it is already complicated enough. in particular the nature of the threshold and

other bound states that have been studied [2327] are not fully understood. furthermore

we should keep in mind that while the matrix model reproduces string theory at short

distances, the fact that it also does so at long distances seems to be entirely due to the

super-symmetric non-renormalization theorems. at nite temperature supersymmetry is

broken and perhaps we should not expect this. for all these reasons the study of matrix

models at high temperature is worthwhile.

a related model of d-instantons, the ikkt matrix model [20], which is 0+0 dimensional

has been solved exactly for n=2 [8]. the d-0-brane action that we are interested in, is

a quantum mechanical one (i.e. 0+1 dimensional). however after compactifying the eu-

clideanised time, if one takes the high temperature limit, it reduces to a 0+0 dimensional

model. there is thus a hope of solving this model order by order in  but to all orders in

gs using the same techniques as [8]. one can then calculate physical quantities such as the

mean square separation of the d-0-branes - a measure of the size of the bound states. this

is what is attempted in this paper. we obtain the leading behaviour in . we can also

estimate, the corrections to the leading result. the noteworthy feature being that each term

is exact in its dependence on the string coupling constant .

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we set up the problem and in section 3

we describe briey the solution. the last section contains a summary of the result and some

conclusions.

if we euclideanize and compactify time on a circle of circumference  the action becomes

s = iz

(2.0.4)

and the elds satisfy the boundary conditions

x (0) = x (),

(0) = ()

considering these boundary condition, we can expand the elds x ,  in modes as

the rst and the second terms in the action give the masses of the modes of the vector and

the spinor elds respectively, namely, 2n

 .

the partition function with this action is

z = z eis

(2.0.7)

in the next section we will try to calculate this .

3. the partition function and the effective potential.

3.1. pfaan

the fermionic terms in the action are of the form (a,r0b,sx 
  0 limit, the rst term in the action (2.0.6) is dominant and (x 
a,n)n6=0 is of the order
. so, in large temperature limit the rst term contributes to the partition function in
the leading order of  only for n = 0 (a,r0b,rx 

c,0) . with these terms the action takes

c,n)n+r+s=0 and a,rb,r. in

now, we will try to nd out the pfaan

c,0 and x 2

c,0, x 1

(3.1.2)

we rotate x 

c,0 by a lorentz transformation so that only x 0

c,0 are nonzero.

we take the representation of the gamma matrices, in which

0 = i2  18,

1 = 3  18,

2 = 1  18

(3.1.3)

with this choice of representation we can write

sf =

xr=(a,r  2r



so, the pfaan will be

(3.1.5)

we can see that the above expression has so(3) symmetry in spinor indices, and so(2, 1)

symmetry in the vector indices. the 16r6 term gives the free fermionic contribution. note

that it is temperature independent as the hamiltonian is identically zero for free fermions

in 0 + 1 dimensions.

in innite temperature limit ie   0, the rst term dominates. to see the comparitive

 dependence of the other terms;

1) we set (x

a,n

2) keep the terms contributing to the leading order of the partition function in   0 limit
(this is justied in appendix a).
3) transform back x

and we can write the partition function up to a numerical factor

3.3. leading interaction term.

now we try to calculate the eect of the interactions.

as argued earlier the leading  dependence is given by the zero modes, so in the rst

approximation we drop the terms in the action involving the higher modes. thus we get,

 (x1,0.x2,0)2  (x2,0.x3,0)2  (x3,0.x1,0)2o

we would like to rst calculate the leading order contribution to z that is

z0 = z dx 

a,0eis0

now, consider the parametrisation

(3.3.1)

(3.3.2)

x1,0 = (x1, ~r1),

x2,0 = (x2, ~r2),

x3,0 = (l, 0)

(3.3.3)

if we had considered the original action with all the modes the action would not be lorentz

invariant, for example the terms x 0

a,lx i

b,mx i

c,n and x i

a,nx i

a,n in the original action are not

lorentz invariant. however, expression (3.3.1) has lorentz invariance, and we are justied

in using this parametrisation in order to evaluate (3.3.2).

under this parametrisation, the action (3.3.1) takes the form

s0 =

2 + r2

1x2

the partition function is

z0 = z d10x 

1,0d10x 

2,0d10x 

3,0eis0

(3.3.4)

(3.3.5)

at this stage, we can nd the temperature dependence of the partition function and the

mean square separation of two d-0 branes from simple scaling argument. as we have seen

the leading order i.e. the zero mode contribution of the partition function comes from the

7

term 1

of this parametrisation will be dierent for dierent n, but in each case the function will
be homogeneous in l, ri, xi where 0 < i < n 2  2 and of order 4. so, in each case we need to
scale these variables by  1

3.4. non-leading interaction term.

in the previous section we have seen that the leading order fermionic contribution comes from

the free fermionic terms. here we will try to estimate the  dependence of the non-leading

fermionic contributions.

in terms of the parametrisation in eqns. (3.3.3),

(3.4.2)

where the rst term is the leading order fermionic partition function we have discussed in

subsection (3.2).

so we can see that in the partition function at high temperature the contribution of the zero

modes (bosonic) is dominant. we have earlier argued that the higher modes of the bosonic

elds will also contribute in non-leading terms.

3.5. mean-square separation of the d-0 branes.

as we are working in euclidean metric and since for zero mode calculation we have

lorentz symmetry, we can identify l as one of the spatial components and hence as the

separation between two d-0 branes.

now, we try to see the temperature dependence of the expectation value of l2n

hl2ni = r eisl2n

z

(3.5.1)

(3.5.2)

i.e.

hl2ni = ( 1

1+l2)7/2 exph(cid:16) l2

as l is the separation of two d-0 branes, we get the mean square separation of two d-0

branes from this, by putting n = 1 and doing the integral numerically, and restoring ls, we

get

*  l

ls!2+ = 6.385  

gls! 1

2

(3.5.3)

if we assume high temperature expression has a nite radius of convergence, we can conclude

that the mean square separation is nite for nite temperature. this implies that there is a

conning potential that binds the d-0 branes. as argued earlier the scaling argument that

gives the  and g dependence in 3.5.3 is valid for all n . so we can conclude that hl2i  q g



for all n.

10

3.6. eective potential.

for high temperature we have evaluated the partition function both for large and small

l (eqn.3.3.11,3.3.13). up to leading order the eective potential between two d-0 branes is

proportional to  log l and log l for small and large l. we can see that the potential increases
at both l ends, though we can not clearly see the nature of the potential in the intermediate

region but we can conclude that the potential is a conning potential and binds the d-0

branes.

4. conclusion

in this paper we have attempted to solve the n = 2 matrix model in the high temperature

limit . the leading nontrivial term of the partition function has been calculated exactly (eqn.

3.3.10). the non-leading terms can also be systematically calculated although we havent

attempted to work them out in this paper. from a scaling argument we have also determined

the  and g dependence of the leading term for any n. this complements the work of [6],

where the one loop partition function was calculated with the entire  dependence. we

nd that hl2i  q g

 (eqn. 3.5.3) (true for any n), the niteness of which shows that there

must be a potential between d-0 branes that binds them. in [2,6] also a logarithmic and

attractive potential were found. the present calculation being exact in gs is valid at all

distances. thus unlike in [2,6], the (nite temperature) logarithmic potential found here is

attractive at long distances and repulsive at short distances so it has a minimum at non-zero

separation. similar issue for low temperature has been discussed in [27]. in [2] it was found

that at high temperatures, the conguration with all the d-0-branes clustered at the origin

i.e. with the zero separation, had lower free energy than the one where they were spread

out. however, that was a large n calculation and also restricted to one loop. it is therefore

possible that more exact calculation will resolve this issue.

as mentioned in the introduction, describing completely the dynamics of two d-0 branes

11

in m-theory would require the innite n model. whether some high temperature expansion

of that model within the 1

n approximation scheme can be attempted is an open question.

appendix a: comparitive  dependence of the terms in action

we are interested in investigating the comparitive  dependence of the terms in the

action in eqn. (2.0.6). for convenience, in this part we will suppress the isospin and vector

indices. the action takes the form

s =

1
g





xn=;

n6=0

an

2 xnxn + xl+m+n=0

fn


xlxmxn  c



xn,m,l,p=,

n+m+l+p=0




xnxmxlxp


(a.1)

where an, bn, c d and fn are constants and are given by an = 2n2 , c = 1

8 , and fn = n

4

now, when we expand the sum over n, m, l and p in last two terms, we will get terms with

all of these indices being 0, with two of the indices being 0 and with one of them being 0,

so the action can be written in the form (taking one of each type, as the terms of the same

type have same  dependence).

s = 



1
g

n6=0

xn=;
g xm,l,p6=0,

m+l+p=0

c



now, we set

anx 2

n 

c
g

0 x 2

n +

g xn6=0

fnx0xnxn

x0xmxlxp 

xnxmxlxp

c

x 2

g xn6=0
g xn,m,l,p6=0,

c

n+m+l+p=0

(xn)n6=0 = qgx 

n

under this transformation, the action reduces to

s = (

c
g

x 4

0) +

2g xn+m+l=0

again, we can neglect 

5

2 x 

nx 

mx 

lx0 and 3x 

nx 

mx 

lx 

p terms also, as they have higher

order  dependence ( 5

2 and 3 respectively). to justify this step, note that since the potential

is always greater than zero, it is equivalent to an integral of the form

z = z dx exp
being a convergent integral, as   0, we can use taylor expansion and write as

x  2cx3  cg3x4

 = z dxeax2
x + ....

n)

neglecting the higher order  terms, we can write the partition function for action (a.2),

x  2cx3  cg3x4


(a.3)

in order to justify dropping the x 2

0 x 2

n and x0x 2

n terms, we can proceed as follows. after

doing the xn integral the partition function reduces to

0o
g x 4
z = qg yn6=0z dx0
(an  fnx0 + c2x 2
0 )
n is positive, (an  1)  fnx0 + cx 2

expn c

1
2

0 is also positive , i.e.

as here 4(an  1)c  f 2
[an  fnx0 + cx 2

0 ] > 1. so

(a.4)

(a.5)

expn c

0o
g x 4
(an  fnx0 + c2x 2
0 )

< exp(

c
g

x 4

0)

1
2

 1
2

n expn c

and the integral is nite. so in   0 limit the leading order term can be given by
0o and the corrections will vanish at the positive power of  . so,
r dx0a
in   0 limit we can ignore those, which is equivalent to ignoring the fnx0xnxm and
c2x 2

n terms in action so it can be written as

g x 4

0 x 2

which is also eqn.(3.3.1).
