abstract

we review some aspects of three-dimensional quantum gravity with
emphasis in the cft  geometry map that follows from the brown-
henneaux conformal algebra. the general solution to the classical
equations of motion with anti-de sitter boundary conditions is dis-
played. this solution is parametrized by two functions which become
virasoro operators after quantisation. a map from the space of states
to the space of classical solutions is exhibited. some recent proposals
to understand the bekenstein-hawking entropy are reviewed in this
context. the origin of the boundary degrees of freedom arising in
2+1 gravity is analysed in detail using the hamiltonian chern-simons
formalism.

1 introduction

general relativity is a non-linear eld theory which is highly complicated
both at the classical and quantum levels. even though a large number of
classical solutions exists, a general classication of the space of solutions has
never been achieved. the non-renormabizibility of quantum gravity is not
related to this issue, but if the general structure of the space of solutions of
the einstein equations was known, then the quantum version of phase space
perhaps would be more manageable.

it is this aspect of three-dimensional gravity that makes it attractive
because the general solution to the equations of motion can be written down.

1

in this paper, we shall exploit this fact trying to formulate a quantum theory
of black holes by quantizing the space of solutions directly.

another important aspect of three-dimensional gravity is its formulation
as a chern-simons theory[1]. quantum chern-simons theory is well under-
stood for compact groups and positive values of the level k [2]. however, we
shall be interested in euclidean gravity with a negative cosmological constant
whose associated group is sl(2, c), which is not compact, and the level k is
negative (see eq. (19) below). the quantization is then not straightforward.
we shall follow an alternative route by rst solving the equations of motion
with prescribed boundary conditions and then quantise. we shall see that
the boundary conditions will play an important role in making the quantum
theory well-dened.

1.1 brief description of the results contained in this

article

let us start by briey mentioning, without proofs, the main results which
will be of interest for us here. the relevant proofs will be given below. we
should remark at this point that most of the results presented her are known
in the literature in various contexts (the relevant quotations will be given in
the main text). the aim of this article is to put things together in a self-
contained framework, and to explore some aspects of quantum black holes in
three dimensions.

let m be a three dimensional manifold with a boundary denoted by m.
we assume that m has the topology of a 2-torus. let {w, w, } coordinates
on m such that the boundary is located at e =: r  , and w, w are
complex coordinates on the torus. the three-dimensional metric 1,

ds2 = 4gl(ldw2 + ld w2) +(cid:16)l2e2 + 16g2l le2(cid:17) dwd w + l2d2.

(1)

where l = l(w) and l = l( w) are arbitrary functions of their arguments
satises the following properties:

(i) exact solution
the metric (1) is an exact solution to the three-dimensional vacuum einstein

1g represents newtons constant and l is the anti-de sitter radius related to a negative

cosmological constant by  = 1/l2. we set h = 1 throughout the paper.

2

equations with a negative cosmological constant  = 1/l2. the leading and
subleading terms of (1) (in powers of r = e) are, of course, the ones dictated
by the general analysis of [3] for asymptotically anti-de sitter spacetimes.
what is perhaps not so well-known is that adding the term e2l l, the
metric becomes an exact solution. most importantly, (1) is the most general
solution, up to trivial dieomorphisms, which is asymptotically anti-de sitter.
note that since (1) contains two arbitrary functions, it gives rise to an innite
number of solutions.

we shall work in the euclidean sector of the theory. this means that w
is a complex coordinate related to the spacetime coordinates as w =  + it.
the metric (1) is then complex. as we shall see, this will not bring in any
problems in the quantization. for real values of w, the metric (1) is a solu-
tion to the minkowskian equations of motion.

(ii) physical degrees of freedom
two solutions of the form (1) with dierent values for l and l represent
physically dierent congurations which can not be connected via a gauge
transformation. in the quantum theory, where l and l will become oper-
ators, dierent expectations values for them will be associated to dierent
solutions.

this is a non-trivial statement. since (1) is a solution to the three-
dimensional einstein equations it has constant curvature and then, locally, is
isometric to anti-de sitter space (see eq. (12) below). the point here is that
the coordinate transformations which change the values of l and l are not
generated by constraints and therefore they are not gauge symmetries. this
point will be analysed in detail in the chern-simons formulation in section
2.3, and in the metric formulation in sec. 4.2.

(iii) residual conformal symmetry
the metric (1) has a residual conformal symmetry. there exists a change of
coordinates {w, w, }  {w, w, } such that the new metric looks exactly
like (1) with new functions l and l. see sec. 4.2 for the proof of this
statement. this change of coordinates is parametrized by two functions (w)
and ( w). the new function l is related to the old one via l = l + l
with,

l = i(l + 2l 

c
12

3)

(2)

3

where c is given by

c =

3l
2g

.

(3)

the same transformation holds for l. thus, under this symmetry, l and l
are quasi-primary elds of conformal dimension 2. this symmetry, properly
dened acting on the gravitational variables, can be shown to be also a global
symmetry of the action[3]. the canonical generators are the functions l and
l themselves and the associated algebra is the virasoro algebra[3],

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +
where the central charge is dened in (3) and ,

c
12

n3n+m,

l(w) = xnz

lneinw.

(4)

(5)

we are using here a non-standard form of the central term. the usual
n(n2  1) form can be obtained simply by shifting the l0 mode as l0 
l0  c/24. this convention is appropriated to the black hole background
which has an exact so(2)  so(2) invariance. see [4] for a discussion on
this point in the supergravity context.

(iv) asymptotic conformal symmetry
the residual symmetry (2) is not an exact symmetry of any background
metric. rather it is a symmetry of the space of solutions described by (1); it
maps one solution into another one. however, this symmetry can be regarded
as an asymptotic symmetry of anti-de sitter space because the r   form of
(1) is asymptotic euclidean ads3 space (note the redenition of coordinates:
w =  + it, r = e),

(6)

ds2

(r)  r2(dt2 + d2).

(we have kept here only the leading terms in powers of r, but note that there
is also a term 2i(l  l)dtd of order one which is allowed by the boundary
conditions[3].) since the asymptotic behaviour (6) does not see l and l it
is invariant under the transformation (2). this symmetry was discovered in
[3]. see [38, 36] for recent discussions.

(v) basic dynamical variables and induced poisson brackets
the virasoro algebra (4) can be regarded as the basic poisson bracket algebra

4

of the gauge-xed residual variables. in other words, the functions l(w) and
l( w) appearing in (1) are the part of the metric eld g(x) which survives
after the gauge is xed (i.e., after gauge conditions are imposed and the
constraints solved), with anti-de sitter boundary conditions. the equal-time
poisson bracket of general relativity, {ij, gkl} = ij
kl, induces the virasoro
algebra (4) on the remaining dynamical functions l and l. a technical note
is convenient here. from the dynamical point of view, l and l both depend
on w and w. however, the gauge-xed equations of motion read  wl = 0
and w l = 0 leading to l = l(w) and l = l( w).

the dual role of l and l as generators of a symmetry as well as basic
variables has an analogue in the w zw action. in that case, the currents
j a(z) are both the generators of the kac-moody symmetry as well as the ba-
sic variables of the problem. actually, this is more than an analogy. in the
chern-simons formulation of three-dimensional gravity one nds in a natural
way a w zw model at the boundary [5]. in this paper, we shall not make
explicit use of this fact although we shall include comments and comparisons
between our treatment, based in the analysis of global symmetries, and the
w zw approach.

(vi) black holes and ads space
if l and l
the space of solutions described by (1) contains black holes.
are constants (no w, w dependence) with only l0, l0 dierent from zero and
parametrized as

(7)

ml = l0 + l0,

j = l0  l0,

then the metric (1) is globally isometric to the euclidean three-dimensional
black hole [6, 7] of mass m and angular momentum j,

ds2 = l2n 2dt2 + n 2dr2 + r2(d + in dt)2,

(8)

with

n 2(r) = 8mg +
n (r) =

(9)

(10)

eq. (7) is appropriated to the virasoro algebra shown in (4).

5

for m > |j|, this metric has two horizons which are the solutions to the
equation n 2(r) = 0. [it is often convenient to dene the euclidean angular
momentum je as je = ij and then the i in (8) does not occur. note also
that in the euclidean sector, the black hole manifold does not see the interior
r < r+.] the transition from (1) to (8) is done via the identication of the
real coordinates  and t (note that t is dimensionless)

w =  + it,

(11)

plus a radial redenition. see sec. 4.3 for more details on this point. for
j = 0 and 8mg = 1 the metric (8) reduces to euclidean anti-de sitter
space in three dimensions,

ds2

ads = l2 1 +

r2

l2! dt2 + 1 +

r2

l2!1

dr2 + r2d2.

(12)

(vii) a quantum metric, the cft geometry map and black hole
entropy
once the functions l and l are promoted to be operators acting on fock
space, the metric (1) becomes a well-dened operator, denoted as ds2, on that
space. we then nd a map from focks space (representations of the virasoro
algebra) into the independent classical solutions of einsteins equations. let
| > a state in focks space, we have
| >  ds2

 =< |ds2| >

(13)

with l =< |l| > and l =< | l| >. by construction ds2
 is a solu-
tion to the classical einstein equations because (1) is a solution for arbitrary
functions l and l. it also follows that the full set of states | > generates
the full space of classical solutions. we can then ask the question of how
many states are there in fock space such that they induce through (13) a
black hole of a mass m and angular momentum j. this counting can be
done and yields an entropy equal to s = a/(4gc1/2). the factor c1/2 shows
that this is not yet the right approach. we shall discuss these ideas in sec.
4.4. two modications of the quantisation scheme which do give the right en-
tropy will be considered. other possible solutions have been considered in [8].

6

(viii) relation to 2d induced gravity
finally, note that for l = 0 and xed r, the metric (1) is equal to polyakovs
[9] 2d lightlike metric which yields an sl(2,) algebra. since 3d gravity is
known to induce 2d gravity at the boundary (r xed), the understanding of
the quantum properties of (1) may yield new information about 2d gravity.

1.2 organisation of the article

the goal of this article is to discuss and provide the proofs for the above
properties of the metric (1). we have written (i)-(viii) in a metric formulation
of gravity because our nal target is quantum gravity. however, the explicit
proofs will be given in terms of the chern-simons formulation [1] of three-
dimensional gravity because they are simpler and provide a rich mathematical
structure.

in sec. 2 we give a short introduction to chern-simons gravity and its
phase space. a detailed discussion about boundary degrees of freedom is
included in that section. in sec. 3 the explicit solution to the equations of
motion, with two dierent classes of boundary conditions, is written down
(in terms of the chern-simons elds) and their induced poisson brackets are
displayed. finally, in sec. 4, we go back to the metric formulation and apply
the results to quantum three-dimensional gravity.

2 chern-simons gravity and global degrees

of freedom

in this section we shall rst briey describe the chern-simons formulation
of three-dimensional gravity. then we analyse the issue of global degrees of
freedom associated to the presence of boundaries. we shall also show in this
section how the boundary conditions solve part of the unitary problems of
three-dimensional gravity.

2.1 the strategy

since chern-simons theory does not have any local excitations, all relevant
degrees of freedom are global. we shall consider here the situation on which
the topology is xed and thus all relevant states come from the presence

7

of boundaries. to properly account for the degrees of freedom living at
the boundary we shall follow the regge-teitelboim approach [10] which can
be summarised in the following steps. given an action i[] with a gauge
symmetry  we need to:

 impose boundary conditions on the elds such that i[]/ exists.
these boundary conditions are not unique and their election represent
an important physical input into the theory. [in practice, one rst de-
cide the boundary conditions and then add to the action the necessary
boundary terms to make it dierentiable.]

 find the sub-group of gauge transformations that leave the boundary

conditions and the action invariant.

 find the canonical generators which generate the symmetries of the
action. if a generator is a constraint, we shall call the associated sym-
metry a gauge symmetry. congurations which dier by gauge symme-
tries are identied and represent the same physical state. conversely, if
a generator is dierent from zero (even on-shell), we call the associated
symmetry a global symmetry. note that according to this denition,
global symmetries do not need to be rigid. global symmetries map the
space of physical states into itself.

we shall see that a proper distinction between global and gauge sym-
metries is crucial to understand the boundary degrees of freedom in
chern-simons theories.

2.2 chern-simons gravity, its equations of motion and

their solutions

in our approach to the quantum black hole problem, the chern-simons for-
mulation of 2+1 gravity will be of great help. this formulation was discovered
in [1] and its quantum properties (for closed manifolds) were explored in [11].
an extensive treatment can be found in [12]. in two words, the chern-simons
formulation is a eld redenition that simplies the equations and introduces
a rich mathematical structure.

the basic variables of general relativity in the tetrad formalism are the

8

triad ea and the spin connection ab. in three dimensions one denes2 a =
ccb can
(1/2)a
be written in the form rab = ab
c. in
ec.
the same way, the torsion t a = dea + a

bcbc. it follows that the 2-form curvature rab = dab + a
bcb
bcb

crc with ra = da + (1/2)a
b eb reads t a = dea + a

the equations of motion of three dimensional gravity with a negative

cosmological constant in these variables are simply

ra =

1
2l2 a

ec,

t a = 0.

we dene now two new elds according to,

aa = a +

ea,

i
l

aa = a 

ea.

i
l

(14)

(15)

the 1-form aa is an sl(2, c) yang-mills gauge eld. let f a and f a the cur-
vatures associated to aa and aa. the discovery of achucarro and townsend
[1] is that the equations,

f a = 0,

f a = 0,

(16)

are exactly equivalent to the three-dimensional einstein equations (14). fur-
thermore, the einstein-hilbert action is equal to the combination [13],

i[a, a] = i[a]  i[ a],

where

i[a] =

is the chern-simons action at level,

k

k =

4g

.

(17)

(18)

(19)

the trace is taken in the representation shown in [13] with a = aaja and
a = aaja. note that we use the same js in both cases. this means that a
is not the complex conjugate of a.

2these denitions, and the properties that follow, depend on the signature. the for-

mulae displayed here are appropriated to euclidean signature.

9

for positive values of newton constant g the level k given in (19) is
negative. (changing the sign of l does not help because it interchanges a
with a.) this is principle will lead to problems in the quantization of the
theory. note, however, that there is a bigger problem to be solved rst,
namely, the gauge eld a is complex and thus the relevant group is sl(2, c)
which is non-compact. these two problems means that we cannot apply in
a straightforward way the quantization of chern-simons theory described in
[2]. our prescription to dene the quantum theory will be to rst nd the
general solution the classical equations of motion, under prescribed boundary
conditions, and then quantize that space. as we shall see, the boundary
conditions will play a key role in making the quantum theory unitary (see
sec. 2.6).

the convenience of the chern-simons formulation is evident. instead of
working with a second order action in terms of the metric, we work with
two at yang-mills elds. the equations (16) show clearly that 2+1 gravity
does not have any local degrees of freedom. this means that all dynamics is
contained in the holonomies [11] and boundary degrees of freedom [14, 15].

the general solution to the equations (16) can be written in the form,

a = g1dg + g1hg,

(20)

where h is also at (dh + h h = 0) but cannot be written as u1du with
u single valued. similar arguments hold for a. the group element g(x) is
a single valued map from the manifold to the group. the space of solutions
(20) is invariant under

a  a = u 1au + u 1du

(21)

where u is another map from the manifold to the group. in principle (see
below for a detailed discussion), we can use this symmetry to set g = 1
in (20) and thus all solutions are classied only by the independent values
of holonomy h. the quantization of this sector of phase space was rst
discussed in [11].
its dimensionality is nite and cannot account for the
large black hole degeneracy. for this reason we shall not consider them here
anymore. however, it is important to stress that the black hole gauge eld
does have non-trivial holonomies. indeed, it can be shown that the gauge
eld corresponding to a black hole satises [16],

p expi a =: exp(w),

p expi a =: exp( w)

(22)

10

where

tr(w2 + w2) = 322mg,

tr(w2  w2) =

322jg

l

,

(23)

and m and j are the black hole mass and angular momentum, respectively.
only for 8gm = 1 and j = 0 these holonomies are trivial. the corre-
sponding solution is anti-de sitter space (12).

2.3 global symmetries and boundary degrees of free-

dom

the presence of the boundary has a crucial eect in the dynamics of chern-
simons theory, namely, the appearance of an innite number of degrees of
freedom. this point has been analysed in great detail by carlip in a series of
papers [17] using a covariant formalism and path integrals (see also [15] for an
approach similar to ours). here, we shall describe an equivalent procedure to
dene the boundary degrees of freedom, based on the hamiltonian formalism
in the form discussed by regge and teitelboim [10].

the appearance of boundary degrees of freedom can be summarized as
follows. chern-simons theory has 3n elds aa
 ( = 0, 1, 2; a = 1, ..., n).
however, the gauge symmetries of the action tells us that they do not rep-
resent independent physical degrees of freedom. in fact, locally, using the
symmetry (21) one can kill all of them (the temporal component aa
0 is a
lagrange multiplier, while the spatial components aa
i are 2n elds subject
to n constraints f a

ij = 0 plus n gauge conditions).

the question we want to address here is whether the symmetry (21)
is really a gauge symmetry, in the sense that two elds related by it are
to be considered the same, or not. after properly dening what a gauge
transformation is, we shall see that at the boundary the transformation (21)
is not a gauge symmetry, although it is still a symmetry of the action. then,
two solutions of the form (20) with g and g such that, at the boundary, g 6= g
represent two dierent physical congurations. this boundary eect can give
rise to an innite number of degrees of freedom (independent solutions to
the equations of motion). at this point we can make contact with carlips
would-be-gauge degrees of freedom approach: the eld g, at the boundary,
is dynamical and its dynamics is governed by a w zw action[17].

in the presence of boundaries the denition of a gauge symmetry becomes
delicate because not all the transformations encoded in (21) are generated by

11

constraints. indeed, if u does not approach the identity map at the boundary,
then the associated canonical generator is a non-zero quantity and hence that
transformation is not a gauge symmetry. in sec. 2.5 we shall give a brief
proof of this statement for chern-simons theory, but let us rst review the
general framework.

following diracs quantization procedure (see [18] for an extensive treat-
ment), we dene a gauge transformation as a symmetry generated by a (rst
class) constraint. on the contrary, a symmetry of the action generated by
a non-zero quantity will be called global, even if it is not rigid. by deni-
tion, the space of physical states, or phase space, is the set of elds which
satisfy the equations of motion, modulo gauge transformations. let us ig-
nore the holonomies for a moment. the general solution (20) then reduces
to a = g1dg. if no boundaries are present, this space of solutions is triv-
ial containing only one element a = 0 because the transformations (21) are
generated by constraints (hence, they represent gauge symmetries) and one
can use (21) to set g = 1 and thus a = 0.

on the contrary, if there is a boundary, part of the symmetry (21) is not
generated by a constraint (to be proved below). therefore, while it is still
true that we can transform any at a to 0 using (21), it is not true that
the state a and the state 0 represent the same physical conguration. both
states, a 6= 0 and a = 0 (at the boundary), are solutions to the equations
of motion and they are related by a symmetry of the action. however, they
are physically distinguishable. indeed, there is a gauge invariant conserved
charge which takes dierent values in each state. our main problem is then to
determine the set of elds a which solve the equations of motion and cannot
be set to zero by the action of a constraint. as we shall see, in chern-simons
theory there is an innite number of them.

in a quantum mechanical notation, the above discussion can be summa-
rized as follows. denote by g0 the set of transformations which are true
gauge symmetries generated by constraints, and by q those which are not.
physical states satisfy g0| >= 0. on the other hand, q generates a sym-
metry of the space of physical states, that is q| >= | >. we shall prove
explicitly (at least in chern-simons theory; for a general discussion see [19])
that g0 and q satisfy an algebra of the form,

[g0, g0] = g0,
[g0, q] = g0,

12

(24)
(25)

[q, q] = q + c

(26)

where c represents (schematically) a possible central term. eq. (24) is the
denition of rst class constraints. eq. (25) means that if | > is physical
(g0| >= 0) then q| > is also physical (q generates a global symmetry of
the hilbert space). finally, eq. (26) is the algebra of the globally symmetry.
the appearance of central terms in (26) cannot be discarded by a general
principle [19]. note however that since q does not generate a gauge sym-
metry and it is dierent from zero, the central term does not represent any
trouble after quantization. an interesting and important example on which
the central term is present was discovered in [3]. we shall see other examples
below.

the above discussion is a quick summary of the results presented in
[10, 20, 19, 3], and many other papers that have followed this work. the
nice property of chern-simons theory is that these ideas can be tested with
minimum calculations. another system which is simple to analyse is yang-
mills theory on which the above analysis leads to the denition of global
colour charges[21]. however, in that case, the resulting global algebra is
nite dimensional and does not have any central terms.

2.4 boundary conditions in chern-simons gravity

2.4.1 making the action dierentiable

the black hole manifold is asymptotically anti-de sitter and then it has a
boundary. in the euclidean sector, the boundary has the topology of a torus
with compact coordinates  and t. it is convenient to dene the complex
coordinates on the torus

w =  + it,

w =   it,

(27)

and then ad + atdt = awdw + a wd w.

boundary conditions are necessary in order to ensure that the action
principle has well dened variations. as discussed above, all the dynamics of
2+1 gravity is contained in the boundary conditions. for this reason, it is a
key problem to choose them judiciously. in particular, if they are too strong
there will be no dynamics left in the theory. for the black hole problem
(which is asymptotically anti-de sitter) there is a natural choice of boundary

13

conditions rst discussed in [22] in the minkowskian signature and extended
to euclidean signature in [23]. in the coordinates (27) they read simply

aa

w = 0,

aa

w = 0

(at the boundary).

(28)

a quick way to convince ourselves that the black hole satises this con-

dition is to consider the constant curvature metric

ds2 = e2(dx2 + dy2) + l2d2.

(29)

a natural election for the triads are e1 = edx, e2 = edy and e3 = ld.
impossing the torsion equation dea + a
bcb  ec = 0, one nds for the com-
ponents of a: 1 = (1/l)edy, 2 = (1/l)edx and 3 = 0. dening
w = x + iy it is clear that aa = a + (i/l)ea and aa = a  (i/l)ea satisfy
(28). it can be shown that the black hole metric (8) which is also of constant
curvature satises (28) as well [23]. see [24] for the explicit transition from
(29) to (8).

let us check that (28) are enough to make the action dierentiable. the
variation of the chern-simons action gives a term proportional to the equa-
tions of motion plus a boundary term,

ics = zm

(30)

the boundary term vanishes due to (28). thus, the variation of the action
under the boundary condition (28) is well dened. later we will restrict
further the values of the gauge eld at then boundary, but for the purposes
of this discussion the above boundary conditions are very useful.

as a further check that the chern-simons action with the boundary con-
ditions (28) is appropriated to the black hole problem, one can prove that
the value of the action (17) (with no added boundary terms) on the eu-
clidean black hole solution is nite and gives the right canonical free energy
(gibbons-hawking approximation) [25].

14

2.4.2 the boundary group

the second step in the regge-teitelboim procedure is to determined how the
gauge symmetries are aected by the boundary conditions, i.e., to determine
the residual group of transformations that preserves (28). this is actually
very simple. we look for the set of parameters a satisfying

aa

w = d wa = 0

(at the boundary).

(31)

since by (28) a w = 0 this condition simply imply that  wa = 0. the
subset of gauge transformations leaving (28) invariant are then those whose
parameters at the boundary are chiral, only depend on w.

let us now check that this group leaves the action invariant. the variation

of the chern-simons action under aa = da gives a boundary term,

which vanishes thanks to (28) and (31). there is an important point to be
stressed here. it is often said in the literature that the chern-simons action
is invariant under aa = da only if  = 0 at the boundary. this is, as
we have just shown, not true. the right statement is that  cannot be com-
pletely arbitrary at the boundary but it can be dierent from zero. under
the boundary condition (28), the action is invariant under transformations
with non-zero values of a at the boundary provided that parameter is chiral
(a = a(w)). this gives rise to an innite dimensional symmetry.

2.5 ane (kac-moody) algebras

let us briey describe the main steps leading to (24-26) in chern-simons
theory. for more details, the reader is referred to [26, 27] and [28].

and compute ai(x) = [aa
i (x), g0()]. it is direct to see that the functional
derivative of g0() with respect to ai is well-dened only if a vanishes at
the boundary. in that case, one does nd [aa
i (x), g0()] = dia and thus
g0() generates the correct gauge transformation. (we stress here that g0()
should not be identied with the constraint: g0() is the constraint smeared
with a parameter that vanishes at the boundary.)

however, as we discussed in sec. 2.4.2, the chern-simons action with
the boundary condition (28) is also invariant under transformations whose
parameters at the boundary are chiral a = a(w) but dierent from zero.
what is then the generator of those transformations? consider

q() = z

(37)

it is easy to check that the boundary term arising when varying the bulk part
of (37) is cancelled by the boundary term, without imposing any conditions
over . the combination (37) then has well dened variations even if  does
not vanish at the boundary. furthermore, one can check that [aa
i (x), q()] =
dia and therefore q does generate those transformations whose parameters

16

[q(), q()] = q([, ]) +

ada.

(38)

k

4 z

do not vanish at the boundary. the key point here is that q is no longer
a combination of the constraints (for  6= 0 at the boundary) and thus it
is dierent from zero, even on-shell. according to the previous discussion,
q generates a global symmetry of the action. two congurations which
dier by a transformation generated by the action of q represent physically
dierent states.

by direct application of the poisson bracket (35) one can nd the alge-
bra of two transformations with parameters  and  not vanishing at the
boundary,

this equation should be compared with (26). also, note that if  vanishes
at the boundary then q() = g0(). one can then easily see that (38)
reproduces (24) and (25) as well.

the algebra (38) provides the simplest way to determine the poisson
bracket structure on the space of functions which cannot be set to zero by
the action of a constraint. we shall do this explicitly in next section. for the
time being, note that from (37) it is clear that the values of a at the boundary
cannot be changed by the action of a constraint. indeed, the pull-back of a
to the boundary represents the physically relevant degrees of freedom.

2.6 unitarity. an su (2) eld

to end this section, we mention an important consequence of the boundary
conditions (28). namely, they provide a simple solution to one of the prob-
lems with unitarity in chern-simons gravity. as we have mentioned above,
the gauge eld a = a + (i/l)ea is complex and therefore the relevant group
is sl(2, c) which is non-compact. it has been argued in [29], and explicitly
used for example in [30] and [23], that under some conditions in the path
integral one can set ea = 0 and work with the su(2) gauge eld aa = a.
for closed manifolds, this has been shown to give a good prescription [29],
but it is not the case for manifolds with a boundary.

the boundary conditions (28) lead to a simple solution to part of this
problem. indeed, expressing (28) explicitly in terms the triad and spin con-
nection they read,

a

w +

i
l

e w = 0,

a
w 

i
l

ew = 0.

(39)

17

using these equations, the non-zero components of a and a at the bound-
ary, namely aw and a w, can be written in terms of the spin connection as,

aa

w = 2a
w,

aa

w = 2a
w.

(40)

this shows that the non-zero components of the gauge eld at the boundary,
which in fact carry all the dynamics, are real su(2) currents.

since all the dynamics of chern-simons theory (in our case) will be de-
ned at the boundary, this simple observation means that we can indeed
work with two su(2) currents and forget about the non-compact nature of
sl(2, c). however there are still two problems to be solved. first, the level
k of the chern-simons theory dened in (19) is negative. the representations
of the associated ane su(2)k algebra are then non-unitary. this will be
solved in sec. 3.2 by imposing further boundary conditions [22] which will
reduce the ane su(2)k algebra to a virasoro algebra with central charge
c = 6k > 0. second, in the bulk we still have an sl(2, c) eld. this makes
the statement all the dynamics is contained at the boundary delicate. we
shall not discussed this point anymore in this paper. our prescription will be
to treat the gauge degrees of freedom classically and to quantise the reduced
phase space, after the gauge has been xed. in the language of [5], the chiral
w zw action arises classically and we work with its basic poisson bracket
which is the su(2) ane algebra. actually, we shall not make explicit use
of [5], but rederive the same algebras by studying global symmetries of the
chern-simons action. some comments on the relation between both methods
will be given in sec. 3.3.

for later convenience, we mention here that using (39) the formulae (40)

can also be rewritten in terms of the triad as

aa

w =

2i
l

ea
w,

aa
w = 

2i
l

ea
w.

(41)

these formulae are more useful when constructing the metric out of the
connection via g = ea

eb

ab.

note nally that the equations (39) make a link between the i appearing
in a = w + (i/l)e and the i appearing in the complex structure given to the
torus through w =  +  t (we are using here  = i).

18

3 the kac-moody and virasoro solutions

as discussed in detail in the last section, the presence of a boundary means
that not all the values of the eld a are related by gauge transformations.
two solutions of the equations of motion a and a whose values at the bound-
ary dier by a chiral non-zero transformation are physically distinguishable
solutions.

this means that the space of solutions is not trivial. in this section we
shall explicitly solve the equations of motion and isolate the variables which
are physically relevant. we shall also nd the induced poisson bracket acting
on the space of dynamical functions.

3.1 the kac-moody solution
we work on the solid torus with coordinates {w, w, } and a = awdw +
a wd w + ad. our goal in this section is to nd the general solution to the
equations of motion which satises the boundary condition (28).

the rst step is to x the gauge and eliminate the redundant degrees of

freedom. we impose the gauge condition,

a = ij3,

(42)

which implies that  is a proper radial coordinate (see below). our conven-
tions for the matrices ja are summarised in [13]. note that the i present in
(42) means that e 6= 0. this is necessary because otherwise the triad would
be degenerate.

it is convenient to write a in the form a = b1b where,

b = ei(0)j3 =   e(0)/2

0

0

e(0)/2 ! .

(43)

the constant 0 is not determined by (42) and will be xed below.

next, we look at the equations of motion f = 0 which in the coordinates

{w, w, } read explicitly,

aw  wa + [a, aw] = 0,
a w   wa + [a, a w] = 0,
wa w   waw + [aw, a w] = 0.

19

(44)

the general solution to these equations in the gauge a = ij3 and satisfying
the boundary conditions (28) is,

aw = b1 a(w)b,
a w = 0,

(45)

where a is a chiral function, a = a(w), but otherwise arbitrary. the group
element b is dened in (43). since a is arbitrary, the space of solutions
(45) is innite dimensional. the question is whether dierent solutions with
dierent values for a are related by gauge transformations or not. consider
a conguration of the form (45) and act on it with the transformation,

a = d,

 = b1 (w)b.

(46)

it is direct to see that the eect of this transformation on the solution is
to produce another solution of the form (45) with a = a + dw  (here
dw  = w  + [ a, ]). thus, by acting on (45) with (46) we move around on
the space of solutions.

since the parameter  appearing in (46) does not vanish at the boundary,
the canonical generator of (46) is a non-zero quantity of the form (37). we
then conclude that dierent values of the function a are connected by global
transformations (generated by (37)) and not by the action of constraints.
the function a then represents dynamical degrees of freedom. even more,
since (45) is the most general solution to the equations of motion with the
boundary condition (28), the function a generates the full space of non-trivial
solutions, with the boundary conditions (28).

our next step is to determine the poisson bracket structure acting on
the space of solutions, that is, the induced poisson bracket acting on the
functions a. this is very easy thanks to a general theorem proved in [19].
first, we note that after the gauge is xed (the constraint is solved and (42)
is imposed) the value of q given in (37) reduces to the boundary term,

q() = 

k

4 z a aa,

(47)

which is, as we have emphasized, dierent from zero. the theorem [19] states
that after the gauge is xed (which means, in particular, that q = q) and
one works with the induced poisson bracket (or dirac bracket), the charge
q satises the same algebra (38), as it did the full charge q.

20

the algebra (38), in terms of q, can be put in a more explicit form by

dening,

(38), as desired. the algebra (49) is called kac-moody or ane algebra and
represents an innite dimensional symmetry of the space of solutions. the
quantum version is obtained simply by replacing the poisson bracket by i
times the commutator,

[t a

n , t b

m] = iab

abn+m,0.

(50)

this equation represents the algebra of the gauge-xed basic variables (anal-
ogous to [q, p] = i) of chern-simons theory with the boundary condition (28).
there are various ways to see this explicitly, which also provide alternative
derivations of (50). conceptually, the most direct derivation of this result
is by starting with the three-dimensional poisson bracket (34). then we x
the gauge as in (42) and solve the constraint f = 0. the solutions to the
constraint equation in this gauge are parametrized by the function a. one
can then compute the dirac bracket of a with itself and nd the ane alge-
bra (50). other methods yielding the same result are the w zw approach
followed in [5], and the symplectic method [31]. the idea of looking at rst
class quantities and their algebra in chern-simons theory was rst discussed
in [26].

because of its ane symmetry we shall call the solution (45) the kac-

moody solution to the equations of motion.

3.2 the virasoro solution

in principle we could consider the algebra (50) as our denition for the gauge-
xed basic quantum commutator. as we have pointed out in sec. 2.6, the
gauge eld a is a real su(2) current and therefore the modes t a
n satisfy
the hermitian condition (t a
n. however, the central term k in (50)

n )+ = t a

21

is negative (see (19)) and then the representations of (50) will not be uni-
tary. there is another reason for not to consider (50) as describing the
right boundary dynamics. the metric associated to the solution (45) is not
asymptotically anti-de sitter. we shall see in this section that imposing fur-
ther boundary conditions (which ensure that the metric is asymptotically
anti-de sitter) one can reduce the ane algebra (50) to a virasoro algebra
with a positive central charge. we shall then take the virasoro algebra as
the basic algebra to be quantised.

in the conventions displayed in [13], the solution (45) for aw can be

written as,

aw =

i
2

b1  a3

a+

a  a3 ! b

(51)

with a = a1  i a2 and b is dened in (43). we remind that the other
components of the solution are a w = 0 and a = ij3.
the extra boundary conditions follow from looking at the form of the

gauge eld associated to euclidean anti-de sitter space which satises

a+ =

2
k

,

a3 = 0.

in terms of the modes t a

n dened in (48), these conditions read

n = 0
t +
n,

t 3
n = 0

(52)

(53)

conditions (52) were rst discussed in [32], although their relation to anti-
de sitter spaces was realised in [22]. in the w zw approach, they can be
incorporated in the action by adding lagrange multipliers. this leads to a
gauged w zw action whose conformal generators follow from the gko coset
construction.

we shall impose (52) as part of the boundary data. since (45) solves the
equations of motion for arbitrary values of a+, a and a3, the gauge eld
will still be a solution after imposing (52). this means that among the three
components of the gauge eld aa only one component, a, remains as an
arbitrary function. it is convenient to rename this function as a = 2l and
thus the solution we are interested in has the form,

aw(w) = i 

0

el(w)/k

e

0 ! ,

(54)

22

where l(w) is an arbitrary function of w. in passing from (51) to (54) we
have made a choice for the constant 0 appearing in (43), e0 = 1/k (we
remind that k is negative, see (19)).
the boundary group associated to the set of boundary conditions (28)
plus (52) is no longer the kac-moody algebra (50) because that algebra does
not preserve (52). let us nd the group of transformations leaving (52)
invariant. first, we look for those gauge transformations a = d which
preserve the form (54) changing only the values of l. one nds [32] that
those parameters of the form

 =  

(i/2)

e(l/k + 2/2) (i/2) !

e

(55)

where  = (w) is an arbitrary function of w leave the form of a in (54)
invariant. the function l changes according to,

l = i(l + 2l +

k
2

3),

(56)

showing that l is a quasi-primary eld of dimension two. the next step
is to determine the algebra associated to these transformations. this can
be done by imposing the reduction conditions (52) in the algebra (50) and
computing the induced algebra. geometrically speaking, given a poisson
bracket structure of the form [xa, xb] = j ab(xa) (j ab invertible) one denes
the symplectic form ab as the inverse of j ab. the antisymmetry and jacobi
identity satised by j ab imply that ab is a closed 2-form. now, let (xa) = 0
a set of constraints on phase space such that c := [, ] is invertible.
the surface dened by (xa) = 0 will be called . let  the pull-back of 
into . it follows that the induced poisson bracket structure on  is simply
the inverse of  (the invertibility of  is guaranteed by the invertibility of
c). see, for example, [18] (chapter 2) for more details on this construction.
in our situation we need to consider the matrix (evaluated on the surface

(53)),

c :=   [t +

n , t +
m]
n , t +
[t 3
m ]

[t +
[t 3

n+m (kn/2)n+m !

(57)

which is indeed invertible. we remind here the form of the algebra (50) in
the basis {t  = t 1  it 2, t 3
n},
m ] = 2t 3

n+m.

(59)

(60)

by an straightforward application of the method explained above, the
induced poisson structure [ , ] (or dirac bracket) acting on the surface (52)
can be written in terms of the original bracket [ , ] as (sum over n  z is
assumed),

[a, b] = [a, b] +

kn
2

[a, t +

n ][t +

n, b]  [a, t +

n ][t 3

n, b] + [a, t 3

n ][t +

n, b].

(61)

this bracket, by denition, satises [a, t 3
n ] for any function a,
on the surface (53). now we compute the algebra of the remaining component
t 
n . as before, we dene ln = t 
n /k (the lns are then the fourier modes
of the function l appearing in (54)) and nd,

n ] = 0 = [a, t +

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

c
12

n3n+m

with central charge

c = 6k.

(62)

(63)

as before, the function l(w), or its fourier modes ln, can be understood as
basic variables whose basic commutator is the virasoro algebra. this algebra
will be our starting point to dene the quantum theory. note that since k
is negative (see (19)), the central charge in (62) is positive and thus unitary
representations do exist.

the form of the central term in (62) is not the standard one. one could
shift l0 in order to nd the usual n(n2  1) term. however, for the black
hole whose exact isometries are so(2)  so(2) (due to the identications)
it is more natural to leave the central term as in (62). this is also natural
from the point of view of supergravity on which one nds that the vacuum
black hole killing spinors are periodic [4].

the space of solutions (54) is invariant under conformal transformations
generated by l(w). note that in the chern-simons formulation of three-
dimensional gravity the chern-simons coupling k was related to newtons
constant g as k = l/4g (see (19)). this means that the central charge in
the virasoro algebra c = 6k coincides with the brown-henneaux [3] central
charge c = 3l/2g. this is not a coincidence [22]. as we shall see, the above

24

conformal algebra represents exactly the brown-henneaux conformal sym-
metry of three-dimensional ads gravity. the relation between the reduction
conditions (52) and the conformal symmetry found in [3] was stablished in
[22]. a previous calculation of the central charge using the chern-simons for-
mulation of three-dimensional gravity and a twisted sugawara construction
was presented in [27].

what we have done for the holomorphic sector can be repeated for the
anti-holomorphic sector. the virasoro solution for the anti-holomorphic part
reads

motion. this solution is appropriated to anti-de sitter spacetimes.

we shall call (54) and (64) the virasoro solution of the equations of

3.3 the w zw and liouville actions

we have displayed in this section two solutions to the chern-simons equa-
tions of motion with an ane (sec. 3.1) and virasoro (sec. 3.2) symmetries.
we have argued that the corresponding algebras can be interpreted as basic
poisson brackets acting on the corresponding phase spaces. a natural and
powerful way to justify this point is by studying the induced theories at the
boundary for the corresponding boundary conditions. it is known [5] that
under the boundary condition (28), the chern-simons action reduces to a
w zw action at the boundary whose basic poisson bracket, rst calculated
in [33], is the ane algebra (50). reducing the kac-moody solution via (52)
then gives (62). at this point, a natural question to ask is what is the bound-
ary action (analogue to the w zw action) which would give rise directly to
the virasoro algebra (62) as its basic poisson bracket. we do not know the
answer to this question. however, an alternative route can be taken. it was
shown in [22] that the two chiral w zw actions arising in chern-simons

25

gravity can be combined into a single non-chiral action via g = g1
1 g2. fur-
thermore, the reduction conditions (52) applied to the non-chiral theory
lead to a liouville action [34] which has the expected conformal symmetry
with a central charge equal to c = 6k. the solutions of three-dimensional
gravity can be classied in terms of the solutions of liouville theory. one
nds that the dierent monodromy conditions (elliptic, parabolic and hy-
perbolic) led to the three classes of solutions: conical singularities, extreme,
and black holes[35]. see [36] for a direct relation between the liouville eld
and the anti-de sitter boundary conditions, without using the chern-simons
formalism.

the liouville action is certainly a good candidate to describe the dy-
namics of 2+1 gravity with anti-de sitter boundary conditions. however,
it should be kept in mind that its derivation from the w zw model is not
unique and a better control on some global issues is necessary. first, merg-
ing the two chiral w zw actions into a single one through g = g1
1 g2 is not
unique because g is invariant under g1  ag1, g2  ag2 with a arbitrary.
second, the liouville action arises in terms of a gauss decomposition of the
group element which is not global. for these reasons we have not commit-
ted ourselves to any particular form for the boundary action but instead
we have treated the basic poisson bracket algebras as the starting point for
quantization.

4 a quantum spacetime

we have found in the last section a general solution for the classical equa-
tions of motion with prescribed boundary conditions. we have also found
the induced poisson bracket structure acting on the gauge-xed dynamical
functions. our aim in this section is to quantise those spaces and apply the
results to three-dimensional gravity.

however, an important warning is necessary here. the space of solutions
that we have displayed (kac-moody and virasoro solutions) are explicitly
not coordinate invariant. this means that we could have chosen other coor-
dinates to describe that space and it is not guaranteed that the corresponding
quantum versions would be equivalent. for example, we know is that a full
quantization of the chern-simons action with compact groups induces a shift
in the coupling constant [2] which is not seen in our gauge-xed approach

26

(although it is suggested by the sugawara construction of the conformal gen-
erators). we shall not attack this problem here in the belief that at least in
the large k limit our results can be trusted.

it is worth stressing here that the fact that we have found non-abelian
poisson structures (virasoro and kac-moody algebras) is a consequence of
the self-interacting character of gravity. the non-abelian pieces in those
algebras are measured by the coupling k which in the semiclassical limit,
when gravity becomes linearized, goes to innity.

4.1 the metric

the general solution to einstein equations in three dimensions with anti-
de sitter boundary conditions can be found using the results of last section
, ab
together with the correspondence between metrics g and connections aa

discovered in [1]. given the connections aa
, one constructs the lorentz
vector ea
ab. it follows
from the analysis of [1] that if aa
 satisfy the chern-simons equations
of motion, then g satises the three-dimensional gravitational equations.

for our calculations it will be useful to dene the matrix,

e =

(a  a)

where a = aaja and a = aaja. the spacetime metric is then given by

g = 2tr(ee).

(66)

(67)

the conventions for the ja matrices are displayed in [13].

the kac-moody solution (45) (and its anti-holomorphic part) is certainly
a very general and interesting solution for the chern-simons equations of mo-
tion, however, the induced metric does not satisfy the anti-de sitter boundary
conditions prescribed in [3]. this is the reason that we have also considered
the reduction of (45) via (52) which leaves an asymptotically anti-de sitter
spacetime, with a conformal symmetry.

consider the virasoro solutions (54) and (64) for the chern-simons equa-
tions of motion and let us compute the associated metric. first we compute
the components of the triad (see (66)),

and then, using (67), we nd the metric,

(70)

(71)

where we have used the value of k given in (19). this is the metric that was
displayed in sec. (1.1). we can now go through the properties listed in that
section and check their validity.

first, by construction, (71) solves the einstein equations because the cor-
responding gauge elds solve the chern-simons equations. this, of course,
can be proved explicitly by checking that (71) has constant curvature. since
l(w) and l( w) are arbitrary functions, the metric (71) provides an innite
number of solutions to einstein equations with a negative cosmological con-
stant in three dimensions. these solutions represent dierent physical states
because two metrics with dierent values of l, l are related by a global
dieomorphism. at this point it is necessary to prove that the notion of
global dieomorphism has an analogue within general relativity. since (71)
has constant curvature, there exists a change of coordinates mapping (71)
into the anti-de sitter metric (12). the question is whether that change of
coordinates is generated by one of the constraints of general relativity or not.
in complete analogy with the gauge case, we dene global dieomor-
phisms as coordinate transformations which are not generated by the con-
straints of general relativity[10]. rather, global dieomorphisms are gener-
ated by non-zero quantities which enter as boundary terms in their canonical
generators. this has been analysed in detail in [3] from where we conclude
that two metrics of the form (71), which only dier of the values of l and
l, are connected by a global dieomorphism. the functions l and l then
represent physical degrees of freedom from the gravitational point of view.

4.2 dieomorphisms in chern-simons gravity

it is interesting and instructive to prove explicitly that there exists a change of
coordinates {w, w, }  {w, w, } which preserve the form of (71) changing
only the values of l and l. to nd this transformations we can either do

28

it by brute force acting with lie derivatives on (71), or by using the results
of the last sections making a dictionary between gauge transformations and
dieomorphisms. we shall follow this last procedure.

it is well known that, due to the atness of the gauge eld, in chern-
simons theory the dieomorphism invariance is not an independent symme-
indeed, a dieomorphism along a vector eld  can be written as a
try.
gauge transformation with a parameter a = aa
 [11]. the converse is, in
general, not true. however, in the case of chern-simons gravity where the
relevant group is sl(2, c) and an invertible triad exists, one can prove that
all gauge transformations act on the metric as dieomorphisms.

, ab

more explicitly, let g the metric associated to a particular conguration
aa
 through (66) and (67). now, consider an arbitrary gauge transforma-
tion with parameters a, a acting on aa, aa. it follows that the transformed
metric (associated to the transformed elds) is related to the original one by
a dieomorphism generated by a vector eld 

to prove this statement, and nd the explicit formula for 

(,), consider
the action of the gauge group on the triad. from (66) we nd that under a
gauge transformation a = d,  a = d the triad changes according
to,

(,).

e =

l
2i

 (  ) 
d(w)

2

[e,  + ].

(72)

here we have used that a + a = 2 where  = a
ja is the spin connec-
tion, and d(w)
 denotes its associated covariant derivative. the second term
in (72) is a lorentz rotation of the triad which does not change the metric.
we then concentrate on the rst term. let us dene the so(3) vector a
and its associated vector eld 

() by,

a =

l
(a  a),
2i
aa
 = e

(73)

(74)

(since we assume that ea
does the transformation,

 is invertible, (74) does make sense) and study how

ea

 = d(w)

 a = d(w)

 (ea

),

(75)

changes the metric. dene the christoel symbols in the standard way as

29

ea


 ea

 = 

3. the transformation (75) then becomes ea

d(w)
; where
the semicolon denotes standard covariant derivative. the action of this trans-
formation on the metric is,

 = ea



g = ea
= (ea
= ; + ;,

ea + ea


ea,
;)ea + ea

(ea

;),

(76)

where in the last line we have used the denition of the metric tensor and
the identity g; = 0. thus, a transformation in the triad of the form (75) is
indeed seen in the metric as a dieomorphism. since the gauge transforma-
tions acting on a, a produce (up to a lorentz rotation) a transformation of
the form (75) with a given in (73), we conclude that the gauge group acts
on the metric as a dieomorphism with a parameter dened in (74).

now we apply this result to the particular case of the residual gauge
transformations (55) and (65). the vector eld 
(,) associated to those
transformations is computed directly from (55) and (65) plus (73) and (74).
the formulae for the triad are given in (68)-(70).

it should be clear from the above analysis that 

, generates a residual
symmetry of the metric (71). this means that if g(l, l) denotes the metric
(71) and g(l,  l) its variation under the residual dieomorphism 
(,),
then one has,

g(l, l) + g(l,  l) = g(l + l, l +  l)

(77)

where l is given in (56).

let us work out explicitly the case on which l = 0. the metric (71)

reduces to the simple form

ds2 = 4gll(w)dw2 + l2e2dwd w + l2d2.

(78)

let us transform this metric with the holomorphic residual transformation
generated by (55). the associated residual vector  = x is computed

3the meaning of this denition can be uncovered by writing it in the form 
beb

change of basis from the coordinate basis  to the orthonormal frame va described by
the matrix ea

from (55) and the triad (68)-(70) with l = 0. in the coordinates {w, w, }
it reads,

(79)

w = i,

transforming the metric (78) with this vector one nds the same metric with
l replaced by l = l + l, and

l = i(l + 2l 

l
8g

3).

(80)

since l/8g = c/12 = k/2 with c and k given respectively in (3) and (19),
we nd consistency with (56), as expected. as a further check, we can now
transform (78) with the anti-holomorphic residual transformation generated
by (65). since l is a quasi-primary eld, we expect that this transformation
will not preserve l = 0 and thus the metric (78) will be transformed into
(71) with l =  l. indeed, from (65) and (68)-(70) we nd the associated
transformation,

 =

w =

 w = i +

(81)

we act on (78) with this vector and nd a metric of the form (71) with
l = (il/8g) 3 . this is exactly the right transformation, in accordance
with (80) applied to the anti-holomorphic eld.

4.3 black holes

as we have mentioned several times, the metric (71) reduces to a three-
dimensional black hole [6, 7] when l and l are constants. this can be
proved as follows. first, we dene the real coordinates , t and r by,

and

w =  + it,

r2 = r2

+ cosh2(  1)  r2

 sinh2(  1).

(82)

(83)

the constant 1 is given by e21 = (4g/l)ql0 l0. this radial denition has

the property l2d2 = n 2dr2 where n 2 is the lapse function appearing in the
black hole metric (8). after a long but direct calculation one can prove that

31

the metric (71), in the coordinates {t, r, }, is exactly equal to the metric (8)
provides one identies,

l0 + l0 = ml =

l0  l0 = j =



r2
+ + r2
8gl
2r+r
8gl

.

,

(84)

(85)

since we are working in the euclidean sector, the coordinate t appearing
in (82) and (8) is periodic, 0  t < , with  = 2l2r+/(r2
). in order
to x the period of the time coordinate to be independent of the black hole
parameters (and thus x the complex structure of the torus), one can dene
z =  +  x0 with 0  x0 < 2 and  = i/2. since  and x0 are periodic,
the complex coordinate z is dened on a torus,

+  r2

z  z + 2n + 2 m,

n, m  z.

(86)

with  its modular parameter. introducing  is particularly convenient when
studying modular invariance on the black hole manifold[23, 37]. we shall not
deal with this issue here, so we use (82).

4.4 the quantum space of metrics. state counting

we have described in the last paragraph a set of metrics parametrized by
two functions whose induced poisson bracket yield the virasoro algebra with
a non-zero central charge. we have also argued that the two functions l and
l could be interpreted as the basic variables of the gauge-xed phase space.
we shall now promote the algebra (62) to be a quantum algebra. as we shall
see this procedure will not give rise to a straightforward correct counting for
the black hole entropy, and there are open problems in this respect. the
discussion of these issues is the goal of this section.

the unitary representations of the virasoro algebra for a given positive
central charge c are parametrized by a single real positive number h.
in
the semiclassical limit with k large, the virasoro central charge c = 6k is
then large. under these conditions, there exists one unitary representation for
each conformal dimension h. we start with the vacuum state |h > satisfying
l0|h >= h|h > and ln|h >= 0 (n > 0). the excited states are constructed
with the negative modes ln acting on |h >. the full representation, for a

32

given h, is spanned by the vectors |n1, ..., nr; h >:= ln1    lnr|h > with
r = 1, 2, .... the same construction has to be repeated for the other vira-
soro algebra ln. the full fock space is the direct product of both virasoro
representations with conformal dimensions h and h.

in standard conformal eld theory, the values of h are not arbitrary. they
are equal to the conformal dimensions of the primary elds h of the theory.
the state |h > is created by h via |h >= h(0)|0 > where |0 > is the true
conformal vacuum. in our situation, we do not have a eld theory at the
boundary (of course it could be liouville theory, see sec. 3.3 for a discussion
on this point) but only the virasoro algebra acting as basic poisson bracket
algebra. the usual state-operator map will then be missing until we decide
which is right conformal eld theory.

once we promote the modes ln and lm to be operators acting on fock
space, the metric (71) becomes an operator that we shall denote by ds2.
note that since the metric (71) is an algebraic function in l and l which
does not involve products of non-commuting operators, it is well dened in
the operator sense.

we can now dene a natural map from fock space to the space of classical
solutions. for each state | > in fock space, we associate a classical solution
to the equation of motion given by,

ds2

 =< |ds2| > .

(87)

here, l =< | l| > and l =< |l| >. since the metric (71) is a solution
for arbitrary values of l and l, the metric (87) is a solution for any state
| >. more interesting, the full set of solutions (71) can be generated by the
above map.
according to (87), every state | > induces a unique classical solution.
the converse is not true. for a given classical solution there may be many
associated states. in particular, there are many states associated to a given
black hole of mass m and angular momentum j. as explained before, the
metric (71) give rise to a black hole when l and l are constants and related
to m and j by (84) and (85). let us count the number of states in fock
space, labelled as |m, j >, such that

< m, j|(ln + ln)|m, j > = lm0
n,
< m, j|(ln  ln)|m, j > = j0
n.

(88)

33

this is actually very simple. the states |n1, ..., nr; h >, properly normalized,
precisely have the property,

< n1, ..., nr; h|ln|n1, ..., nr; h >= l00

n with l0 = h +

ni.

(89)

r

xi=1

the number of these states (l0, l0) for large values of l0 and l0 is approx-
imated by the well-known ramanujan formula,

c(l0, l0) = e2cl0/6+2c l0/6,

(90)

with, in our case, c = 1. unfortunately, this naive counting does not give
inserting lm = l0 + l0 and j = l0  l0 in (90) gives
the right result.
an entropy equal to s = c1/2a/4g, where c is the central charge (3) and
a = 2r+ is the perimeter of the horizon. (the relation between the dierent
parameters is given in (84) and (85).) the prefactor c1/2 shows that our
naive procedure is not yet correct because we would expect the degeneracy
of states to be equal to the bekenstein-hawking value.

the main assumption that we have made in our approach is that the
functions l and l are the basic variables of the theory, and the virasoro
algebra (62) their basic commutator. from the point of view of general
relativity this conclusion followed in a natural way, but it does not yield to
the correct answer.

if we do not regard (62) as the basic algebra but only as representing the
symmetry algebra of some underlying conformal eld theory, then an elegant
and striking way to relate (62) with the correct bekenstein-hawking entropy
is available [38]. suppose that the algebra (62) represents the virasoro alge-
bra associated to some conformal eld theory with central charge c. suppose
also that this cft is unitary, in the sense that l0, l0 > c/24 (note that we
are using the ramond virasoro generators with the non-standard convention
for the central charge), and that the partition function

is modular invariant,

z[ ] = tr e2i l02i l0

z[ ] = z[ ],

  =

a + b
c + d

,

34

(91)

(92)

for any a, b, c, d  z and ad  bc = 1. then, it follows [39] that that number
of states with l0 and l0 xed is again given by (90) but this time with c = c.
the associated entropy is then exactly equal to the bekenstein-hawking value
s = a/4g with a = 2r+ equal to the perimeter of the horizon.

as stressed in [8], this result is too beatiful to be wrong. even more,
recently [40, 41], it has been shown that under some boundary conditions
at the horizon, similar results can be applied to higher dimensions. these
are exiting results which bring closer the long standing dream of a statis-
tical mechanical description for the bekenstein-hawking entropy. however,
there remains to nd the conformal eld theory responsible for the degrees
of freedom and, most importantly, to determine whether general relativity is
enough to describe that cft, or other degrees of freedom like string theory
are necessary.

an alternative route to get the right counting was suggested in [42]. for
integer values of the central charge c, there is a natural way to add degrees of
freedom to the theory in such a way that the counting yields the right result.
the idea is that the virasoro algebra (62) can be regarded as a sub-algebra
of another virasoro algebra, with central charge 1 and generators qn, via the
formula,

ln =

qcn.

(93)

1
c

see [43] and references therein for a detailed description of this embedding.
(the formula (93) has also appeared in [44].) the number of states associated
to the representations of the q-theory is again given by (90) with c = 1 and
l0 replaced by q0. since by (93) q0 = cl0, this yields the right result when
using (84) and (85). the main problem with this approach is that we do not
know how to relate the gravitational degrees of freedom to the generators
qn. perhaps one should look for other boundary conditions, generalising
(52), which may give other conformal structures, generalising (62). this
issue is presently under investigation.

whether the virasoro operators are fundamental variables or not, this
will not change our quantum geometry picture. the microscopical origin
of the black hole degeneracy is associated to dierent states (living in the
correct cft) which generate the same classical metric through (87).

5 final remarks

maldacena [45] conjectured a duality between large n super-conformal eld
theory in four dimensions and type iib string theory compactied on ads5
s5. this relation has become known as ads/cft correspondence due to the
relation between the symmetry groups in each theory. the result of brown
and henneaux [3] relating ads3 and a conformal algebra in 1+1 dimensions
can also be regarded as an ads/cft correspondence. note however that
contrary to the higher dimensional case, this relation involves only asymp-
totic ads space whose isometry group is innite dimensional. in [46, 47] the
relation between these two aspects of the ads/cft correspondence has been
explored.

in this paper we have not made explicit use/reference to this correspon-
dence. as described above, we have interpreted the virasoro algebra as basic
poisson bracket acting on the space of solutions, rather than as generators
of asymptotic symmetries.

finally, we would like to mention here a surprising motivation to study
three-dimensional gravity. it has been shown in [48] and [49] (see also the
recent review [50]) that there exists duality transformations relating ve-
dimensional black holes with three-dimensional ones. this means that ev-
erything we can learn about three-dimensional quantum gravity can be useful
to higher dimensional situations.
