abstract

we calculate the vacuum expectation values of local elds for the two-parameter
family of integrable eld theories introduced and studied in [11]. using this result
we propose an explicit expression for the vacuum expectation values of local opera-
tors in parafermionic sine-gordon models and in integrable perturbed su (2) coset
conformal eld theories.

1 introduction

the vacuum expectation values (vev) of local elds play an important role in quan-
tum eld theory (qft) and statistical mechanics [1, 2].
in statistical mechanics the
vevs determine the generalized susceptibilities i.e. the linear response of the system
to external elds. in the qft dened as a perturbed conformal eld theory (cft) the
vevs provide all the information about its correlation functions that is not accessible
through direct calculations in conformal perturbation theory [3]. recently some progress
was made in the calculations of the vevs in two dimensional integrable qft. in the ref.
[4], an explicit expression for the vevs of the exponential elds in the sine-gordon and
sinh-gordon models was proposed. it was shown in [5] that this expression can be ob-
tained as the minimal solution of certain reection relations which involve the liouville
reection amplitude [6]. in this approach the sinh-gordon qft can be considered as a
perturbed liouville cft. in the same paper the reection amplitude for the boundary
liouville theory was used for the calculation of the vevs for the boundary sinh-gordon
and sine-gordon theories. in ref. [7] the same method was applied to the calculation of
the vevs of the exponential elds in the so called bullough-dodd model with real and
purely imaginary coupling. it is known that c < 1 minimal cft perturbed by the opera-
tors 12 and 13 can be obtained by a quantum group (qg) restriction of the sine-gordon
[8] and imaginary bullough-dodd [9] models with special values of the coupling. these
relations were used in [7] to calculate the vevs of primary elds in a perturbed minimal
cft. the results are in good agreement with numerical data obtained in [10].

in this paper we consider the vevs of local elds in a two-parameter family of inte-

grable qfts with the action :

a = z d2x(cid:20) 1

16h(1)2 + (2)2 + (3)2i

 2he1 cos(2 + 3) + e1 cos(2  3)i(cid:21),

where the parameters , ,  satisfy the relation :

2 + 2  2 =

1
2

.

in this paper we use the following parametrization for , ,  :

42 = p + n,

42 = n + 2,

42 = p.

(3)

the qft (1) was introduced and studied in [11] where the dual -model representa-
tion for this theory available in the strong coupling region , ,  >> 1 was constructed.
the qft (1) contains as particular cases the known integrable models : n = 2 super-
symmetric sine-gordon theory, o(4) and o(3) non-linear -models, the sausage model
[12], [13] and others. in ref.
[14] the qft (1) was used for the study of tunneling in
quantum wires. for integer n the theory (1) admits a qg restriction to the parafermionic
sine-gordon models [15] with actions (35). for integer n and p it can be restricted to the
integrable perturbed su2(n)  su2(p  2)/su2(p + n  2) coset cft [16].

in section 2 we use cft methods to calculate the reection amplitudes for the
exponential elds exp(a1+ib2+ic3) in the qft (1). we solve the functional reection
relations for the vevs of these elds and do some tests to conrm the result. the strong
coupling asymptotics of the vevs are considered.
in section 3 we use our results for
the qft (1) to calculate the vevs of the basic elds in the parafermionic sine-gordon
models. as particular cases we consider n = 1 and restricted n = 2 supersymmetric
sine-gordon models.
in section 4 we calculate the vevs of the primary elds in the
integrable perturbed su(2) coset cft models. as an example, we consider a minimal
n = 1 supersymmetric cft perturbed by an operator preserving supersymmetry. in the
last section we discuss the relation between vevs and certain quantities in cft.

2 reection amplitudes and vacuum expectation val-

ues in two parameter family of integrable qft

the starting point for the calculation of the vevs in an integrable qft, which can
be dened as a perturbed cft, is the calculation of the reection amplitudes for the
local elds in the basic cft [5, 7]. for the qft (1) we can interpret the rst four terms
in eq.
(1) as the action of the cft and the last one as the perturbation (the choice
of perturbation between two last terms is, of course, conventional). the action of the
corresponding cft has the form :

acf t = z d2x(cid:20) 1

16h(1)2 + (2)2 + (3)2i  2e1 cos(2 + 3)(cid:21),

(4)

where parameters , ,  satisfy the condition (2). this action can be also obtained as
the conformal limit (  0, 1  , e1 is xed.) of the action (1).
complex coordinates of r2 :

ensures the local conformal invariance of the qft (4) with the central charge c = 3 + 3
the exponential elds

22 .

v (a, b, c; x) = exp(a1 + ib2 + ic3) ,

v (a, b, c; x) = v (a,b,c; x)

are spinless conformal primary elds with dimensions :

in particular, elds

 = (a, b, c) = a(2q  a) + b2 + c2.

v (, , ; x) = exp(1 + i2 + i3) ,

v (, , ; x) = v (,,; x)

(6)

(7)

(8)

have conformal dimension equal to one.
besides the conformal symmetry generated by t  t2, the qft (4) possesses an addi-
tional innite-dimensional symmetry generated by the chiral algebra t which includes an

3

innite number of holomorphic elds t2, t3, ... with integer spins. the detailed description
of the chiral algebra t is not within the scope of this paper. as an example of the spin 3
eld t3  t, we give here the holomorphic primary eld :

t3 = d(z)3 + e(z)(z1)2 + f (z)(2

where  = 2 + 3, d = 1+62
the other elds tj, j > 3 can be obtained by fusion of the eld t3.

z )(z1) + l(3
1+22 ; e = 32; f = 63; g = 3(1 + 22); l = 1

z 1) + g(2

z ),

(9)

2 (1 + 22).

the primary elds t of the chiral algebra t can be classied by the eigenvalues tj of

the operators tj,0 (the zero fourier components of the currents tj) :

tj,0t = tjt,

t2 = .

(10)

the elds v (a, b, c) are the primary elds of the chiral algebra t with the parameters
tj = tj(a, b, c). all of the functions tj(a, b, c) possess the reection symmetry tj(a, b, c) =
tj(2q  a, b, c). for j = 2, this follows from eq. (7); for j = 3 one can easily derive this
property from the explicit form of t3. the elds v (a, b, c) and v (2q  a, b, c) are the
reection image of each other and are related by the linear transformation :

v (a, b, c; x) = r(a, b, c)v (2q  a, b, c; x),

(11)

where r(a, b, c) is the reection amplitude.

this function is an important object in cft (it denes the two-point functions of the
operators v ) and plays a crucial role in the calculation of one-point functions in perturbed
cft. to calculate the function r(a, b, c) we introduce the elds t :

t = n1(a, b, c)v (a, b, c),

(12)

where the normalization constant n(a, b, c) = n(a,b,c) is chosen in the way that
elds t satisfy the conformal normalization condition 2 :

< t (x)t(y) >=

1

|x  y|4 .

(13)

the normalized elds t are invariant under the reection transformation and hence :

r(a, b, c) =

n(a, b, c)

n(2q  a, b, c)

.

for the calculation of r(a, b, c), we note that operators q+, q dened as :

q+ = z d2xv (, , ; x)

; q = z d2xv (,,; x)

(14)

(15)

commute with all of the elements of the chiral algebra t and can be used as screening
operators for the calculation of correlation functions in the cft (4).

2this condition will be used later for the normalization of operators in perturbed cft.

4

for a = m with integer m, we obtain from eqs. (12),(13) the following expression

for the function n(a, b, c) in terms of coulomb integrals :

n 2(a, b, c) = |x|4

(m!)2 < v (a,b,c; 0)v (a, b, c; x)qm

+ qm


>,

(16)

where the expectation value in (16) is taken over the fock vacuum of massless elds
1, 2, 3, with correlation functions :

< i(x)j(y) >= 2ij log |x  y|2.

(17)

exactly the same expression (16) for n 2 can be obtained if we do perturbation theory in
 with the action (4).

for the calculation of the integral (16) we can use the duality relation between a

2n-fold integral with the measure :

dn(u) =

(ui  uj)2

and a 2l-fold integral with the measure :

which has the form :

where

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

using this relation we can reduce the integral (16) to a standard integral calculated in
[17]. as the result we obtain that for a = m, the function r dened by eq. (14) has
the form :

r(a, b, c) = (cid:18) 

42(cid:19)2a/2 ( 1

(1  a/2)

.

where

a = a, b = b, c = c ; a = (a  q).

5

(22)

(23)

we accept eq. (22) as the proper analytical continuation of the function r for all a.

we dene the function g(a, b, c) as the vev of the operator v (a, b, c; x) in the qft

(1) :

g(a, b, c) =< exp(a1 + ib2 + ic3) > .

(24)

as was shown in papers [5, 7] the vev (24) satises the same reection relations as
the operator v (a, b, c) in the qft (4). in this way, we arrive at a functional equation for
the function g(a, b, c) :

g(a, b, c) = r(a, b, c)g(2q  a, b, c).

(25)

to obtain functional equations with respect to the variables b, c, we note that action (1) is
invariant under the transformation   i (  i). the function g(a, b, c) is invariant
under this transformation together with the substitution a  ib (a  ic). as a result,
the function g satises also the functional relation :

g(a, b, c) = r(a, b, c)g(a, 2q  b, c),

(26)

with

where

r(a, b, c) = (cid:18)

and a similar relation with respect to reection of the parameter c.

the vev here is expressed in terms of the parameter of the action . to express it in
terms of the masses of physical particles we note that qft (1) possesses a u(1)  u(1)
symmetry. four basic particles of the theory aq1
q2() ( denotes the rapidity of the particles)
have u(1)u(1) charges q1, q2 = 1. the full spectrum and the scattering theory of qft
(1) are described in ref.
[11]. in particular, it was shown there that the exact relation
between the parameter  and the mass m of a particle aq1

q2 has the form :

.

(31)

using eq. (28) we can calculate the vacuum bulk energy in the qft (1) and compare
it with the value obtained in [11] by the bethe ansatz method. the specic bulk vacuum
energy e0(, , , ) is related to the vev as :

e0




=  <

l


>= 4g(, , ),

(32)

where l is the lagrangean density of our theory and in the last equation (32) we took
into account the symmetries of the action (1). the integrals (29,30) for the g(, , ) can
be evaluated explicitly and we obtain :

e0




= 2

(2)(2)(2)

(1 + 2)(1  2)(1  2)

,

(33)

in exact agreement with the result of ref. [11].

one can do some other checks of eq. (28). a simple consistency check is based on
the fact that at the point 2 = 0, 2 = 2 = 1
4 the qft (1) reduces to two sine-gordon
models at the free-fermion point. it is easy to see that the functions g(0, a, b) coincide
with the expectation values of the exponential operators for the free-fermion theory. one
can do a perturbative expansion near this point and nd an exact agreement with eq.
(28). another check can be done at the point  = i
. at this point, the
qft (1) coincide with an imaginary a3 ane toda eld theory with a coupling constant
corresponding to a perturbing-operator dimension equal to 1
2. the comparison of eq. (28)
with the vev of a3 toda theory gives an exact coincidence. at 2 = 1
2 (p = 2) we have
from eq. (2) that 2 = 2. this line corresponds to the n = 2 supersymmetric sine-
gordon model [11]. the eld exp(a(1 + i2)) represents the lightest component of the
supereld exp(ay (x, )). the calculation of the vev (28) at this line gives the classical
value g(a, a, 0) = 1 in exact agreement with the nonrenormalization theorem for n = 2
supersymmetric qft.

2,  =  = 18

some other tests for eq. (28) associated with qg restrictions of the qft (1) will be
given in the next section. here we note that eqs. (28-30) simplify in the scaling limit
, ,   , a, b, c  0 with a, b, c xed. this (strong coupling) limit corresponds to a
weak coupling limit for the -model which describes the dual representation for the qft
in the scaling limit with a xed physical mass m we

[11] for details).

we intend to use eq. (35) for the analysis of the vevs of the observables in the -
model describing the strong coupling limit of the qft (1) in a separate publication. here
we shall discuss the application of eq. (28) to the perturbed cft which can be obtained
from qft (1) by a qg restriction.

3 expectation values of local elds in parafermionic

sine-gordon theories

for integer values of n = 4(22) = 422 the qft (1) admits a qg restriction with
22 )) 3 [11], giving the parafermionic

respect to the symmetry group uq1(sl2)(q1 = exp( i
sine-gordon models [15] with action :

()2  (cid:18)ei + ei(cid:19)(cid:21),

(35)

n is the action of the zn parafermionic cft with a central charge c = 2  6
where a(0)
and the elds , (, ) are the holomorphic (antiholomorphic) parafermionic currents
with spin  = 1  1
n ( = ). the eld  is a scalar boson eld and the parameter 
is given by :

n+2

2 =

p

n(p + n)

=

42(2  2)

.

(36)

the qft (35) depends on two parameter n and p and we denote it by p(n, p).
besides the conformal symmetry, the zn parafermionic cft possesses an additional
symmetry generated by the parafermionic currents (). the basic elds in this cft
are the order parameters j, j = 0, 1, ..., n  1 with conformal dimensions :

j =

j(n  j)
2n(n + 2)

.

(37)

all other elds in this cft can be obtained from the elds j by application of the
generators of the parafermionic symmetry [18]. so it is natural to introduce as the basic
operators in the qft p(n, p) (35) the local elds :
 = j exp (i),

(j)

(38)

3uq1 (sl2) is one of the symmetries of the qft (1). another symmetry group uq2 (sl2)(q2 = exp( i

2 2 ))
[11, 14] is used in section 4 for the restriction of the qft (35) to the integrable perturbed su (2) coset
cft models.

8

and to consider their vevs.

for this we briey describe the vacuum structure and the spectrum of the qft p(n, p)
[15] for details). p(n, p) possesses an explicit u(1) symmetry. besides this it
(see ref.
has n + 1 degenerate ground states |0s >, s = 1, ..., n + 1, which can be associated with
the nodes of the dynkin diagram an+1. the particles in p(n, p) are the kinks aq
ss()
characterized by the u(1) charges q = 1 and interpolating between vacua s and s with
|s s| = 1. for 42 = p < 1 there are also bound states of kinks b(l)
ss() with u(1) charge
q = 0 and |s s| = 0, 2. the masses ml of these particles are expressed through the mass
m of the kinks aq

ss as :

ml = 2m sin(

lp

),

1
p

.

l 

(39)

the relation between the parameter  in the action (35) and the mass m of the basic
kinks can be obtained by the bethe ansatz method [19, 20] and has the form :


n

(u) = (cid:18) m( p+n

where the function  is dened by eq. (21) and

u =

.

,

(40)

(41)

to calculate the vev < 0s|(j)

 |0s > we should express the elds (38) in terms of
the elds v (a, b, c) in qft (1). for this purpose, we use the bosonization procedure for
the elds j from the parafermionic cft (see ref. [21] for details). the elds j can be
represented in terms of two boson elds 2 and  with the stress-energy tensor :

tp = 

1
4

(z2)2 

1

(z)2 + iq2

z 2,

where q is dened by the eq. (27).

the full stress-energy tensor including the eld  has the form :

t = tp

4

(z)2,

(42)

(43)

where the elds  and  are related to the elds 1 and 3 from the restricted qft (1)
as :

(x) =

2i
n

(i1 + 3)

, (x) =

2
n

(i1 + 3).

(44)

in the cft with stress-energy tensor (43) these elds have the standard two point func-
tions :

< (x)(y) >=< (x)(y) >= 2 log |x  y|2

, < (x)(y) >= 0

9

the elds j can be represented in terms of the elds 2 and  as [21] :

j = n1

j

exp(i

j

2n + 2

2) exp(

j
2n

).

(45)

using eqs. (44)(45) we can express the operator (j)

 in terms of the eld v (a, b, c) as :

(j)

 = jei = n1

j v (a, b, c),

(46)

where :

a = aj, = 2(

j
n

+ 2) , c = cj, = 2(

j

2
n

) , b = bj, = a  c =

j
4

. (47)

the numerical factor nj corresponds to the conformal normalization condition (13) for
the elds (j)
 . this factor can be expressed in terms of the reection amplitude r
(27) associated to the reection of the parameter standing before the twisted eld 2
(v (a, b, c)  v (a, 2q  b, c)), by the relation [7] :
42(cid:19) 2j

r(0, 0, 0)

j =

n 2

.

for the calculation of the vev < 0s|(j)
 |0s > we should also take into account the factor
dj(s) coming from the qg restriction of qft (1). following the conjecture of ref. [7] we
take it in the form :

dj(s) =

n+2 (cid:17)
sin(cid:16) (j+1)s
sin(cid:16) s
n+2(cid:17)

,

(49)

and using eqs. (46),(49) we obtain :

< 0s|(j)

 |0s >= dj(s)n1

j g(a, b, c) = dj(s)gp (j, )

where

gp (j, ) = (cid:18)m( p+n+2

here j is dened by eq. (37), and the dependence of aj,, cj, on j and  is given by eq.

we consider in more detail some particular cases of eq. (50). for arbitrary integer n

gordon model with a coupling constant 2 = p
vev for the eld ei in the sine-gordon theory proposed in [4].

for n = 2 the parafermionic current (z) is a majorana fermion and the theory
p(2, p) describes an n = 1 supersymmetric sine-gordon theory with a coupling constant
2 = p
2(p+2) . the eld   1 is the spin eld for the majorana fermion (z) which has a
square root branch point at the position of the eld . as the result the theory has two
sectors : the neveu-schwarz (ns) sector of local elds and the ramond sector of non-local
ones with respect to (z).

for n = 2 we have three vacua |0s >, s = 1, 2, 3. this fact is in perfect agreement
with the kink structure of the scattering theory for the n = 1 supersymmetric sine-
gordon model. in the ns sector the vevs of the elds ei do not depend on s and are
described by eq. (51) with n = 2. in the ramond sector the vevs of the elds ei are
proportional to 1 for s = 1, 3 and are equal to 0 for s = 2. they have the form :

< ei > = (1, 0)2(cid:18)mp

another particular case that we consider here corresponds to arbitrary n and p =
42 = 2. the qft p(n, 2) posseses n = 2 supersymmetry and is known as the n = 2
supersymmetric restricted sine-gordon model. the n = 2 superconformal algebra with
virasoro central charge

cn =

3n

n + 2

(53)

posseses a representation in terms of a zn parafermionic cft and a massless scalar eld
(z) with stress-energy tensor (42). the supersymmetric currents s(z), s(z) and the
u(1) current j(z) in this representation [22] have the forms :

s(z) = (cid:16)2cn

where n = ( n+2

2 and ((z),(z)) are the parafermionic currents with spins  = 1 1
n.
all the elds in the minimal n = 2 cft with the central charge (53) can be expressed
in terms of elds from the zn cft and the eld . in particular, the so called chiral
elds j, j = 0, 1, ..., n, which satisfy the condition

g

j = 0,

can be represented as :

j(x) = j(x) exp(cid:16)  ijn(x)/(n + 2)(cid:17),

(55)

(56)

and have conformal dimensions j = j
(13) have the operator product expansion

2(n+2) . these elds, normalized by the condition

j(x)l(0) = cjlj+l(0) + o(|x|);  > 0,
with structure constants cjl which have the factorized form [18] :

(57)

(58)

for the analysis of an n = 2 cft it is more convinient to work with renormalized

chiral elds j :

j =

j
aj

;

j = 0, 1, ..., n,

which have the simple operator algebra :

i(x)j(0) = i+j(0) + o(|x|);  > 0,

(59)

(60)

and play the roles of order parameters in the perturbed cft p(n, 2). the expectation
values of the elds j can be calculated using eqs. (50),(56),(58) and have the simple
form :

< j >=< 0s|j|0s >= (cid:18)m

using the notation t = (cid:18) m

where tj(z) is the chebychev polynomial of the second type dened by the relations :

tj(z) =

sin(j + 1)y

sin y

; cos y = z

(63)

in particular, from the condition n+1 = 0 we obtain the equation for the vev of the
order parameter 1 :

tn+1tn+1(

x

) = 0.

the equation (63) denes the critical points of the landau-ginsburg superpotential

w (x) =

),

(64)

(65)

where un+2(z) is the chebychev polynomial of the rst type dened by the relations
un(z) = cos ny, cos y = z; un(z) = ntn1(z) . the function (65) coincides exactly with
the landau-ginsburg superpotential for the perturbed n = 2 minimal cft conjectured
in ref. [23].

at the end of this section we consider briey the vevs in the qft described by the

action

an = a(0)

n  z d2x(cid:18) + (cid:19),

(66)

this integrable qft was introduced and studied in refs.
[24],[25], where its scattering
theory and thermodynamics were described. the most interesting feature of this qft is
related to its large n limit where it describes an o(3)-nonlinear  model.

the vevs of the elds j in the qft (66) can be obtained by taking properly limit
  0,   0 from eq. (50). the limit   0 corresponds to 42 = p  0. as it
was noted in the beginning of this section for p < 1, the qft p(n, p) contains bound
states b(l)
ss of the basic kinks ass, with masses (39). the qft (66) can be obtained from
the qft (35) if we x the parameter m  m1. then in the limit p  0 the kinks ass
have innite mass and the only stable particles that survive after this limit are the kinks
bss  b(1)
ss . the relation between the mass m of these kinks and parameter  in the
action (66) can be obtained from eqs. (39),(40) and has the form [25] :

(1/n) = n(cid:18) m
4n(cid:19)

.

(67)

the kinks bss interpolate between the vacua s and s with |ss| = 0, 2. the subspace
of the ground states |0s > with odd s = 1, 3, ...  n + 1 is invariant under the dynamics
of (66) and form the space of vacua for this qft. taking the limit p = 42  0, m =
xed in eq. (50), we obtain :

in the limit n  , j  n, eq. (68) simplies. in this limit we can consider s/(n + 2)
as continuous variable 0 <  < . the integral qj in this limit also can be calculated
and we obtain :

4 vacuum expectation values of local elds in the

integrable perturbed su (2) coset model

for integer values of p = 42 (in this case 42 = p + n is also integer) the qft p(n, p)
admits an additional restriction with respect to the qg uq2(sl2)(q2 = exp( 2i
p )) to give
the su(2) coset cft models [16] perturbed by an integrable operator c with conformal
dimension  = 1 2
p+n [15]. the actions of these qfts, which we denote as c(n, p), have
the form :

an,p = a(0)

n,p  z d2xc(x),

(70)

where a(0)

n,p is the action of the su2(n)su2(p2)

the normalization factor nj,lm corresponds to the conformal normalization condition (13).
it can be calculated using the integral representation for the correlation functions of the
c(n, p) models with screening charges :

the models c(n, p) possess a discrete set of degenerate ground states |0sr > which are

kinks arr

the scattering theory of these excitations is described in [15]. the mass m of the kinks
is connected to the parameter  in action (70) by the relation [20] :

to calculate the vevs of the elds (j)

the factor that comes from the qg restriction of qft p(n, p). this factor, conjectured
in [7], has the form :

elds in the perturbed minimal cft proposed in [7].

for n = 2 the qft c(2, p) describes n=1 supersymmetric minimal cft models
perturbed by the operator c, preserving supersymmetry. these theories possess two
sectors. the elds local with respect to supercurrent s(z) form the ns sector. the
primary elds in this sector are characterized by j = 0. their vevs are given by eq. (82)

the rst supersymmetric model c(2, 3) describes the tricritical ising model perturbed

the next model c(2, 4) possesses n = 2 supersymmetry. the cft c(2, 4) is charac-
terized by a central charge c=1. its action coincides with the action of a massless free
scalar eld . the representation of the n = 2 superalgebra in terms of the eld 
corresponds to the case n = 1 in eq. (54). the cft c(2, 4) describes the special point
at the critical line of the ashkin-teller (z4) model. this critical line can be parametrized
by the conformal dimension  = 2 of the thermal operator  = 2 cos(). at the
n = 2 supersymmetric point 2 = 2

5 concluding remarks

in the previous sections we calculated vevs in perturbed cft using the data of
the corresponding conformal theory. in this section, which is not directly related to this
subject, we illustrate the application of the vevs in a massive theory to the calculation
of some quantities in a basic cft. as an example, we consider a theory which can be
obtained by the analytical continuation (  b/i) from the qft (35) (parafermionic
sinh-gordon model). this model is described by the action :

an,b = a(0)

n + z d2x(cid:20) 1

(89)

n is the action of the zn parafermionic cft.

where a(0)
for simplicity we consider only the exponential elds va(x) = exp(a(x)) in the qft
(89). the vevs of these elds expressed in terms of the parameter  can be obtained by
an analytical continuation (  b/i,   a/i) from eqs. (51)(40) and have the form :
< va >= gn(a) = (cid:18)(v)
here and later v = 1/n + b2.

the qft (89) can be dened as a perturbed cft where the rst three terms in (89)

a(0)

()2  eb(cid:21).

(91)

for n = 1, 2 this cft coincides with the liouville and supersymmetric liouville models.
it has the stress-energy tensor :

t (z) = tp 

1
4

(z)2 + q2

z ,

(92)

where tp is stress-energy tensor of the zn parafermionic cft and 2q = b + 1/nb = v/b.
the elds va = ea are the primary elds for the cft (91). the reection am-
plitudes for these elds can be obtained from the reection relations for the vevs
(90):

gn(a) = r(n)

b (a)gn(2q  a).

(93)

these can be calculated from eq. (90) or by analytical continuation from eq. (78) (with
j = 0) and have the form :

b (a) = (cid:18) (v)
r(n)

where

a = a  q.

we consider the three point functions (structure constants) of the elds va in the cft

(91) :

j(n)(a1, a2, a3) =< va1(x1)va2(x2)va3(x3) >

(95)

to remove the trivial dependence on xi we put x1 = 0, x2 = (1, 0), x3 = . the function
(95) satises the reection relations with amplitude r(n)
b under all the transformations
ai  2q  ai. for n = 1 and 2 this function was proposed in [6],[27]. to construct a
function satisfying proper reection properties, we introduce functions yn(a) and n(a)
related to the vevs gn(a) by :

yn(a) =

gn(a/2)gn(q  a/2)

these functions satisfy the properties :

yn(a) = yn(2q  a); yn(0) = 0; yn(q) = 1; yn(2(2q  a)) = r(n)

the function (95), which satises the reection properties, coincides with the solutions
for n = 1, 2 and possesses similar factorization properties, can be written in the form :

j(n)(a1, a2, a3) =

yn(0)yn(2a1)yn(2a2)yn(2a3)

yn(p  2q)yn(p  2a1)yn(p  2a2)yn(p  2a3)

the expression (98) possesses the correct analytical properties and semi-classical (b <<

as a function of p = a1+a2+a3 j(n) possesses poles at pk,l = 2qkbl/nb, kl =
0 mod n (and hence, due to (97), at pk,l = 4q + kb + l/nb). in particular, the residue
at the pole pmn,0 = 2q  nmb coincides with the term of order nm in the perturbative
expansion for j(n)(a1, a2, a3) with action (91) :

res j(n)(a1, a2, a3)

this residue can be calculated using the functional relations (97). in this way we arrive
at the following expression for the parafermionic generalization of the integral calculated
in [17] :

1

(nm)! z hva1(x1)va2(x2)va3(x3)

nm

ys=1

(us)(us)eb(us)idu1...dunm

(99)

= (cid:18)(v)

n (cid:19)nm n1
yi=0

m1
yj=0

(ba1 + jnb2 + iv)(ba2 + jnb2 + iv)(ba3 + jnb2 + iv)

((j + 1)nb2 + iv)

where x1 = 0, x2 = (1, 0), x3 =  and the expectation value in (99) is taken over the state
that is the direct product of the zn parafermionic theory vacuum and the fock vacuum
for the massless eld .

ba1 + ba2 + ba3 = v  nmb2;
