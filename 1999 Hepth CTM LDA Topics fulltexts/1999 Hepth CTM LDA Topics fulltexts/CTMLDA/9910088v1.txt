abstract

i propose a class of d  2 lattice su(n) gauge theories dual to
[u (n )]d conjugation-
certain vector models endowed with the local
invariance and zn gauge symmetry. in the latter models, both the
partitition function and wilson loop observables depend nontrivially
only on the eigenvalues of the link-variables. therefore, the vector-
model facilitates a master-eld representation of the large n loop-
averages in the corresponding induced gauge system. as for the par-
titition function, in the limit n   it is reduced to the 2dth
power of an eective one -matrix eigenvalue -model which makes the
associated phase structure accessible. in particular a simple scaling-
condition, that ensures the proper continuum limit of the induced
gauge theory, is proposed. we also derive a closed expression for the
large n average of a generic nonself-intersecting wilson loop in the
d = 2 theory dened on an arbitrary 2d surface.

1 introduction

the theory of connement in the d = 4 continuum su(3) yang-mills
gauge system endures as a tantalizing challenge over the last few decades.
one possible strategy to deal with this problem was introduced in the seminal
paper [1] of k.wilson. the general idea is to consider a lattice reformulation
in the right universality class, the lattice
of the continuum y m theory.
system undergoes (for certain critical value g2
0 of the bare coupling constant
g2 ) a phase transition characterized by the divergence of the correlation
length. in this case the continuum y m theory (supposed to be unique in
d = 4 ) can be recovered as the low-energy theory at the scales much larger
than the lattice spacing, with g2 approaching g2
0 along the w ilsonian rg
trajectory.

the employed so far d > 2 lattice y m theories are too unwieldy to
handle analytically. consider for example the most popular subvariety of the
one-plaquette su(n) lattice actions. the latter is dened by associating to
each site x a factor

ef ({r })

x{r }

d(d1)/2

y=1

r (u(x)u(x + )u +

 (x + ))u +

 (x)),

(1.1)

where the multiple fourier expansion (in terms of su(n) irreducible repre-
sentations r ) involves the holonomies wrapped around d(d  1)/2 ele-
mentary plaquettes. besides the space-time dependence, the models like (1.1)
depend nontrivially on the o(n 2) degrees of freedom: not only on the o(n)
eigenvalues eij (), j = 1, ...n, but also on the nondiagonal (angular)
components  of the relevant link-matrices u =  diag[ei()] +
 ,  =
1, ..., d .

so far our analytical knowledge about systems of this type has been very
limited, with the proper continuum limit of the d > 2 lattice gauge systems
have been remaining beyond grasping. besides the y m2 on a 2d surface
[9, 4, 8], the available solvable examples are mainly restricted to the situa-
tions [2, 3] where the model can be transformed into some eigenvalue-theory
of q (hermitean or unitary) matrices. the goal of the present paper is to
take the reverse way around and induce lattice gauge theories from vector-
eld models of the eigenvalue-type. by denition, the (eective) action of

2

the latter is formulated in terms of such variables that makes manifest the
invariance under the set of  - dependent [u(n)]q -conjugations

s({ w+

}) = s({ w}) = x{r}

f ({r})

q

y=1

r( w) ,

(1.2)

is the set of arbitrary u(n) matrices.

where ,  = 1, .., q,
in other
words, the largest possible conjugation-invariance (1.2) leads to the crucial
simplication: the action sef f ({ w})  o(n 2) depends nontrivially only on
the o(n) associated eigenvalues eij () of q (unitary or hermitean) matrices
w,  = 1, ..., q .

to generate a consistent mapping onto the gauge models, i propose to
start with the lattice systems dened in terms of the su(n) link-variables
u(z) and invariant under the local

[u(n)]d conjugation-invariance

u(z)  h+

 (z) u(z) h(z) , h  u(n) ,  = 1, ..., d,

(1.3)

combined with the reduced gauge symmetry with respect to the center t of
the lie group

u(z)  h +(z) u(z) h(z + ) , h(z)  t , t = zn ,

and, as a result of (1.4), with the global [zn]d -invariance

[t ]d : u(z)  tu(z) ,

t  t = zn .

(1.4)

(1.5)

this class of eigenvalue-systems, being reduced to the one-plaquette subva-
riety, can be dened as following. generalizing eq. (1.1), one is to associate
to each site x the factor

es y{}

r (u(x))r (u(x + ))r (u +

x{r }
(1.6)
(where s  s({r}) ) in compliance with the pattern (1.2). what is even
more important, owing to (1.3) the average of a (nonself-intersecting) wilson
loop

 (x + ))r (u +

 (x)),

wc(u) = tr(u(x)u(x + )...u(x  )) = tr( y{zkc}

uk(zk) )

(1.7)

3

can be also directly expressed, as we will see, in terms of the corresponding
eigenvalues

< wc(u) >= n 1lc < y{zkc}

tr(uk (zk)) > .

(1.8)

the mapping of the model like (1.6) onto the corresponding gauge system
is to be performed in the two steps. first, we introduce the auxiliary su(n)
scalar eld g(z) (assigned to the lattice sites)

u(z)  g+(z) u(z) g(z + ) ,  = 1, ..., d,

(1.9)

via the gauge-transformation that leaves invariant both the su(n) mea-
sure du(z) and the wilson loop observables (1.7). second, one inte-
grates over the scalar eld g(z) with the haar measure (normalized by

r d g(z) = 1 ) that results in the associated eective theory with the mani-
festly gauge-invariant action sef f ({u(z)}) . indeed, after the extension (1.9)
the corresponding action s({ g+(z)u(z) g(z + )}) is invariant under the
gauge transformations

u(z) = g+(z) u(z) g(z + ) ,

g(z) = g+(z) g(z) ,

(1.10)

formulated for g(z) in the unconventional way. the crucial consequence of
the extended gauge symmetry (1.10) is that the induced sef f ({u(z)}) nec-
essarily assumes the conventional form of the multi -plaquette lattice y m
action composed from the generic closed wilson loops (1.7). in other words,
the haar integrations over g(z) intertwine the contractions of the u(z) -
tensors to recollect the latter into the gauge-invariant combinations (1.7). for
example, a single  -component of the block-product in eq. (1.6) after the
four dierent g(z) -integratioons ( refered to the sites of the corresponding
elementary  -plaquette) is mapped onto

 r (u(x)u(x + )u +

 (x + )u +

 (x)) .

(1.11)

by construction, the gauge systems induced via (1.9) from the eigenvalue-
models (1.6) (invariant under (1.3)-(1.5)) are endowed with the same set of
symmetries as the conventional lattice gauge theories like the wilsons one.
in this perspective, the local [u(n)]d -symmetry (1.3) can be viewed as the

4

hidden symmetry inherent (via (1.9)) in the proposed family of the induced
gauge theories. it is due to this symmetry the number of the active degrees
of freedom per site is thus substantialy reduced

o((d  1)n 2)  o(dn)

(1.12)

as the action (1.6) does not depend on the nondiagonal components (z)
of u(z) = (z) diag[ei(|z)] +
 (z),  = 1, ..., d . nevertheless, even after
this considerable reduction the model (1.6) is still not transparent enough
to allow for an exact solution. this forces us to search for potentially solv-
able cousins of the su(3) eigenvalue-systems among their limn su(n)
counterparts keeping certain analogue of the t hooft coupling g2n to be
 o(n 0) .
in this limit, due to (1.8) the eigenvalue-model (1.6) can be
viewed as a realization of the master-eld representation for the large n
loop-averages (1.7) in the associated (via (1.9)) induced gauge theory.

indeed, in the large n limit the (z) -independence of (1.6) becomes
particularly advantageous. let the weight es({r }) in eq. (1.6) be a generic
function consistent with the o(n 2) -scaling of the free energy. owing to the
reduciton (1.12) of the active degrees of freedom, in the computation of the
large n partitition function and loop-averages (1.8) one can employ the
good old saddle-point method. the latter is to be applied either to the
d  (n  1) eigenvalues diag[ei(|z)] of u(z) themselves (akin to [10]) or
to their fourier duals (similarly to [5]) - the su(n) representations r(z)
parametrized by the corresponding sets of n  1 integers j(|z), j =
1, ..., n  1 . to generate additional simplications, we constrain the weight
es({r }) to be invariant under the group-product

s(d(d  1)/2)  z2

;

z2 : {} r  {} r.

(1.13)

it combines the group of permutations within the {} -set of the irrep-
indices with the simultaneous z2 -conjugation ( r(u +) =  r(u) ) of all
the involved irreps. the z2 -symmetry plays, as we will see, an important
role for the consistency of the large n construction.

altogether, the partitition function xld of the large n lattice y m

theory induced from (1.6) (in a d -volume ld ) is reproduced

d summations over {r} in eq. (1.17), is dynamically constrained by the

young tableau y (n )
n(r) associated to r . then, in (1.19) both n(r) and n( r)
must be nonnegative multiples of (d  1) . next, taking advantage of the
freedom to choose s({r}) in eq. (1.17), the z2 -invariant eective action
s(r|d) = s( r|d) in (1.19) can be judiciously selected in any required
form consistent with ln[ xr]  o(n 2) . in what follows, our attention will

irreps r  r({p})  y2n of the even symmetric group s(2n) (labelled by the
partititions {p} = [1p12p2...2np2n] of 2n : p2n

finally, the organization of the paper is as following.

in section 2 we
present the details of the large n reduction (1.14) representing xr in the
form of the glr generating functional (1.17). in section 3, the transforma-
tion of the large n glr functional (1.17) into the 1-matrix representation
(1.19) is explicitly performed, and the large n scaling properties of the se-
lected 1-matrix family (1.19) are formulated. the continuum limit (cl) in
the gauge theories induced from the models like (1.6) is analysed in section
4. we propose a simple criterion for the reduced 1-matrix system (1.20)
to ensure the localization {u  1} (modulo (1.16)) in the innitesimal
vicinity, scaling as o(n 0) , of the group-unity 1 . in turn, it predetermines
that in the associated induced gauge theory the link-variables are as well
localized {u(z)  1} (modulo (1.5) and the gauge symmetry) which is
tantamount to the proper cl. the phenomenon of the auxiliary continuum
limits (which accompany the conventional cl) in the eective system (1.19)
is also discussed in connection with the large n phase transitions (pt).

in section 5 we derive a closed expressions for the large n average of a
generic nonself-intersecting wilson loop in the two-dimensional eigenvalue-
system (1.6) on an arbitrary 2d discretized closed surface. building on this
expression, we associate to a given eigenvalue-system (1.6) the correspond-
ing gauge theory (1.1) in such a way that both of them are supposed to
have (in d = 2 ) the same cl. the general pattern of averages (including
self-intersecting loops and irreducible multi-loop correlators) is discussed in
section 6. some peculiarities of the large n pattern of the (multi)loop av-
erages (1.7) are revealed and interpreted. in the last section we make our

7

conclusions and discuss possible directions of further research. the appen-
dices contain technical details employed in the main text.

2 large n reduction of the glr functional.

let us proceed with the derivation of the reduced representation (1.14) of the
large n partitition function xld of the proposed eigenvalue-model (1.6).
we will demonstrate also that reduced actions like (1.15), in fact, reproduce
partitition function of a larger family of eigenvalue-systems including the
multi-plaquette generalizations of (1.6).

to begin with, one notes that in the theory (1.6), xld can be readily
represented in the form which associates to each site z of the base-lattice
the properly weighted sum of the blocks

=1z du d1
d

6= [ r (z)(u +

 (z)) r (z)(u(z)) ]

(2.1)

composed of the characters which in (1.6) are refered to the plaquettes sharing
the d  -links based at z . employing the standard fusion-rules of the lie
group characters

p
k=1 rk (v ) =

p

xk=1

r+(v ) l(p)

r+|{rk} ,

(2.2)

the combination (2.1) can be rewritten in terms of the glr coecients

=1 l(d1)
d

r(z)|{r (z)} l(d1)

r(z)|{r (z)} .

(2.3)

consider the representation of xld in terms of the glr blocks (2.3) and let
the number of sites ld << n while ln[ xld ]  o(n 2) . the remaining
summations over r(z), r(z) , being parametrized by the o(ldn) inte-
gers, in the large n limit can be evaluated with the help of the saddle-point
(sp) approach (in a manner akin to [5]; see also section 4). since the sp
irreps are supposed to be space-time independent

r(0)

 (z) = r(0)


, r(0)

 (z) = r(0)


,

(2.4)

8

the sp equations in the ld -lattice theory (1.6) are reduced to the sp equa-
tions derived from the functional (1.17) associated to the reduced model
(1.15). in relating (1.17) and (1.15) we have used also the (  = 2 case of
the) identity

(2.5)

valid provided that  > 0 , the saddle-point values of both esp({r(0)
 }) and
esp({r(0)
 })/ are unique and positive , while ln[ xp]  o(n 2) . indeed, in
this case the equivalence of the saddle-point equations, associated to both
sides of (2.5), is sucient to prove this identity.

it is instructive to rederive the [ xr]ld  xld correspondence (1.14)
applying the sp method directly to the eigenvalues diag[ei(|z)] of u(z) .
the eective action sef f ({j(|z)})  o(n 2) , where by denition

xld = z yj,,z

exp[sef f ({j(|z)})] ,

(2.6)

is composed of the two parts sef f = s0 + sj . the bare part s0({}) is
associated to the factor (1.6) rewritten as es0({}) . the remaining contri-
bution sj = p,z ln[({p(|z)})] is due to the jacobian induced by the

change of the variables

(2.7)

(2.8)

introducing, u =  diag[ei] + , the angular (nondiagonal)  - and radial
(diagonal) diag[ei] -components. according to (2.8) and the weyl character
formula [7]

r({})(u) = detk,j(eikj )/detk,j(ei(n k)j ),

(2.9)
the action sef f ({j(|z)}) (in addition to the symmetries (1.3)-(1.5)) is in-
variant under the s(n) weyl group of the the permutations

j(|z)  (j)(|z) ,   s(n) .

(2.10)

9

in what follows, the latter symmetry is supposed to be xed by the faddeev-
popov condition (0)
j+1(|z) . having imposed this constraint,
there still remains the whole orbit of the sp solutions (0)
j (|z) generated
apparently by the nite n symmetries (1.4),(1.5).

j (|z) > (0)

the subtlety is that the leading o(n 2) order of sef f ({(0)

j (|z)}) (re-
stricted to the to the sp values {(0)} ) is invariant under the extended local
[zn]d symmetry

[zn]d : u(z)  t(z)u(z) ,

t(z)  zn ,

(2.11)

which is broken by the subleading orders of sef f down to (1.4),(1.5). we
refer to appendix a for the details and now simply make use of (2.11).
in particular, it implies that (having xed (2.10)) the residual su(n) sp
orbit is supposed to be generated from a unique and space-time independent
solution (0)
j (|z) by the set of transformations (2.11) which is larger than
(1.4),(1.5). employing for (2.6) the analogue of the identity (2.5) (readily
modied to account for the degeneracy (2.11)), one arrives at the required
correspondence (1.14) between [ xr]ld and xld .

as a side remark, in the computation of a large n average of a nonself-
intersecting wilson loop (1.7) the subleading orders of sef f ({j(|z)}) must
be necessarily included.
it will be clear from sections 5 and 6 (see also
appendix a). consequently, as far as the limn < wc(u) > averages
is concerned, the extended symmetry (2.11) is not observable directly (al-
though leading to certain peculiarities discussed in section 6).

now we are ready to formulate the following correspondence that will be
used in section 4 for the analysis of the continuum limit. the latter limit
takes place if in the (induced) gauge theory the link-variables are localized in
a vicinity, scaling as o(n 0) , of the group-unity 1 : u(z)  1 modulo (1.5)
and the su(n) gauge symmetry. let in the associated reduced system (1.15)
the coupling constants of sr({u}) are adjusted to provide with similar
localization u  1 (modulo (1.16)). the previous sp analysis implies that
this constraint on sr({u}) ensures that in the corresponding eigenvalue-
system (1.6) the link-variables u(z) (entering the wilson loop observables)
are as well localized

u  1 mod (1.16) = u(z)  1 mod {(1.4), (1.5)} , .

(2.12)

10

in turn, the pattern of the mapping (1.9) guarantees that in the associated
induced gauge theory the condition (2.12) results in the required localization
of u(z) .

ucts qn

finally, let us note that the sp analysis (applied to diag[ei(|z)] ) re-
veals the following direction to generalize the 1-plaquette family (1.6) of
the eigenvalue-models with the partitition function reproduced via the re-
duced system (1.15). first, with the help of the frobenius formula [7]
one is to expand the characters entering (1.6) in terms of the trace prod-
k=1[tr(u k(z))]pk . consider a set of such products associated to the
plaquette-factor based at a particular site x . the idea is to change the ar-
guments in each tr(u k(x)) separately trading x for generic sites. the only
natural restriction for such interchange is that the new set of the trace prod-
ucts remains invariant under the [zn] gauge symmetry (1.4). in this way,
one constructs an eigenvalue-counterpart of the gauge theories with the action
depending on the multi-plaquette wilson loops. provided the interchanges
are performed in the same way for all lattice reference-sites z , the sp values
of diag[ei(|z)] are supposed to be translationally invariant (modulo (2.10)
and (2.11)). consequently, by construction of the interchange the partitition
function of the deformed eigenvalue-system is still reproduced in the large
n limit by the same reduced model (1.15). actually, there are many other
ways to generalize (1.6) preserving the structure of the associated reduced
system.

3 the eective n   1-matrix theory.

further reduction of the glr functional (1.17) to the 1-matrix represen-
tation (1.19) is built on the localization of the large n summations over
{r()}{r()} on the solution {r(0)()}{r(0)()} of the correspond-
ing saddle-point equations. we defer the discussion of these equations untill
the next section, and now simply assert the expected properties of the so-
lution in the case when the constraints (1.13) are additionally imposed. to
be more specic, we select the option when the eective 1-matrix system
in eq. (1.19) is reduced to the family (1.20). altogether, the saddle-point
su(n) -set {r(0)()}  {r(0)()} ,

r(0)() = r(0) = r(0) ,  ; r(0)() = r(0)

, ,

(3.1)

is supposed to be unique , {}{} independent respectively, and selfdual.
as a result, the generating functional (1.17) is equivalent in the large n limit
to the reduced system obtained after the identication
, r()  r  y (n )

r()  r2  y (n )

(3.2)

n

with the remaining summations over r, r2 being localized on the same
saddle-point values (3.1).

since the reduced action (1.15) is composed of the blocks containing equal
amounts of u and u +
 su(n) factors, sr({u}) is invariant under the
larger set of transformations (1.16) where zn is extended to u(1) . as a
result, the partitition function xr is invariant under the substitution of the
su(n) link-variables by the u(n) = [su(n)  u(1)]/zn ones

u su (n )



 u u (n )



,  .

(3.3)

complementary, the involved su(n) irreps r can be viewed as belonging
to the (anti)chiral subset of the u(n) ones. owing to (3.3), the sum in
(1.17) over su(n) irreps r is eectively constrained by the z2 -invariant
pair of the u(n) conditions (nontrivial in d > 2 )

(1.18). in eq. (3.4), the integers n(r), n( r)  z0 denote the number of
boxes in the z2 -invariant pair of the young tableaus corresponding to (3.2):

n(r({})) =

(3.5)

recall also that the irreps of u(n) are labelled by a set of n integers u (n )

(constrained by pn 1

i=1 i = n mod n )

{u (n )} = {1 + n > ... > n 1 + n > n}  [zn /s(n)]

(3.6)

generated from the su(n) -sets of n  1 nonnegative integers {su (n )} =
{1 > 2 > .. > n 1 > 0} by the extra integer number n  0 or n < 0 .
as for the z2 -conjugation r  r , it reads

{i}  {n i+1 + } ,

(3.7)

12

where u (n ) = (n  1) and su (n ) = 1 in the u(n) and su(n) cases
respectively.

next, the eective action for r, r2 , resulting from the reduction (3.2),
contains (according to (1.17)) the dth power of l(d1)
. to simplify this
expression further, one can employ the (  = d case of the) identity (2.5).
altogether, it denes the one -matrix representation of the large n family

sider rst the case of the separable weight s({r()}) = p{} s(r())
which results in s(d)(r2) = d(d  1)s(r2)/2 . once the z2 -selfduality

takes place, the identity (2.5) can be applied once more (this
2
time with  = (d  1)/4 )
xr2
where esr({u })  esr({u})|{u=u } stands for the original reduced action
(1.15) with coinciding arguments. as a result, eq. (3.8) assumes the concise
form

upon a reection, the representation (3.10) remains valid (provided the

essarily separable form of the weight s({r()}) .

into the required form (1.19). note also that we have introduced an implicit
dependence of h(r|d) on d .
let z2 -invariant es(d)(r2)/2d -factor be an arbitrary function of r2 con-
sistent with ln[ xr]  o(n 2) . the central question at this step is what are
the general constraints dening the whole eh(r|d) -family of weights induced
from the es(d)(r2)/2d -variety via (3.11). upon a reection, the pattern of
the u(n) glr coecients ensures that the only dening property of the
eh(r|d) -family is the z2 -invariant pair of the d > 2 conditions (3.4) on the
involved su(n) irreps. in other words, given any irrep r  y (n )

remark that if the additional d > 2 constrains (3.4) in (1.19) were omit-
ted, the d  2 pattern (3.15) of xr would be essentially two-dimensional.
indeed, eq. (3.15) would reduce to the [2d]th -power of the partitition func-
tion associated (when in eq. (1.20) q = 2 ) to the continuum generalized
2d ym on a sphere [8, 4].

in conclusion, we note that similar analysis of the u(n) reduced model
(1.15) (with the sum running over the u(n) irreps) results in the u(n)
counterparts of eqs. (3.10) and (3.15).

3.1 the large n scaling in the selected family of the

1-matrix models.

let us now discuss what conditions make the large n limit of the se-
lected 1-matrix variety (1.20) well dened and consistent with the scaling
ln[ xr]  o(n 2),
|j|  o(n) . as we will see in section 4, the latter
scaling is necessary to ensure the applicability of the saddle-point method
to the summations over the integer-valued {} -elds parametrizing relevant
irreps.

to begin with, for each r({p})  y2n one is to perform the proper change

of the variables

j = j/n , gr({p}) = br({p})n r

, r({p}) = 2  2n 

2n

xk=1

pk ,

(3.17)

postulating that br({p})  o(n 0) . next, the weyl character formula yields
for the irrep dimension

dimr({}) = y1i<jn

(i  j)/(j  i),

(3.18)

15

which foreshadows the constraint i > i+1 inherent in the pattern (3.6) of
the irrep-parametrization. combining the latter constraint with the adjust-
ment (3.17), one concludes that the o(n 2) -order of ln( xr) is necessarily
accumulated by those of |j| which are  o(n) :

{|i|  o(n)}  s({})  o(n 2) ,

(3.19)

which altogether justies that the characteristic values of j = j/n are
 o(n 0) . for deniteness, in the derivation of eq. (3.19) we have supposed
that s({})|{j=(n 1)/2}  o(n 0) when j assume (unadmissible) coincid-
ing values j = (n  1)/2, j . this choice of the additive constant in the
denition of s({}) matches with the introduced pattern (1.20).

we will need also the alternative representation of the measure in (1.20)
when the constrained sum {}  [zn /s(n)] over the strictly decreasing
integers is identically (for q > 0 ) transformed into the unconstrained sum
over the independent integers {}  zn
1

(3.20)

x{}[zn /s(n )]

es({}) =

n! x{}zn

where s({i}) = s({(i)}),   s(n) . it renders manifest the built in
weyl group of the s(n) -permutations, so that the constraint i > i+1
can be reinterpreted as the xing of the weyl symmetry. as a result,
the specic scaling (3.19) can be viewed in fact as a consequence of the
s(n) -invaraince of s({}) augmented by the property that es({}) van-
for
ishes (owing to (3.18)) on any boundary of the weyl chamber, i.e.
{i = j, i 6= j} .

4 the continuum limit and large n pts.

the general idea of the continuum limit in lattice theories is captured by
the well-known intuitively transparent condition. namely, the properly in-
troduced correlation length must tend to innity (in the units of the lattice
spacing) so that the discrete space-time is smoothed-out, for the low-energy
theory, into the continuum manifold. in the lattice gauge systems, the rele-
vant coupling constant(s) should be adjusted in such a way that the wilson

16

loop averages < wc(u) > undergo innitely small changes when the con-
tour c is deformed microscopically (i.e. at the scales of the lattice cut
o).

although in a general case this criterion is rather dicult to implement
analytically, the specic structure of the lattice gauge theories suggests a
simpler alternative. it is intuitively clear that the innite correlation length
is supposed to entail the localization (modulo (1.5) and the gauge trans-
formations) of the link-variables u(z) in the innitesimal vicinity of the
group-unity element 1 . to be more specic, let us x rst the maximal tree
gauge [7] putting u(z) = 1 on a largest possible tree (made of the links)
which by denition does not contain nontrivial 1-cycles. then, introducing
the quantum uctuations aab
 (z)] , the required localization
can be formulated in the large n limit in the form

 (z) = iln[u ab

lim

g2n0

< [aab

 (z)]2 > o(g2) mod (1.5) , a, b = 1, ..., n,

(4.1)

where g2n  g2({gk})n  0 is some o(n 0) functional (see below) of the
relevant coupling constants {gk} that is supposed to approach zero. the
gauge-invariant representation of (4.1) evidently reads as

lim
n

(4.2)

where u(pl) = u(x)u(x + )u +
around an elementary plaquette in an arbitrary  -plane.

 (x + )u +

 (x) stands for the holonomy

next, the scaling (4.1) can be translated into the following (large n )
constraint on the eective action s({a(z)}) for the gauge elds aab
 (z) .
recall that the latter can be composed of not only all possible gauge invari-
ant oprators but also necessarily contains gauge noninvariant counter-terms
(responsible for the restoration of the ward identities following from the man-
ifest gauge symmetry of the lattice gauge theory). employing the symbolic
form (with r({p})  yn standing for the s(n) irrep similarly to (1.20))

where a = 0, , is supposed to be the global minimum (modulo (1.5) and
gauge transformations) of the action (4.3). in the case when the quadratic
gauge invariant combination is not unnaturally suppressed (i.e. ([21], 2) =
0 but ([21], 2) 6= 0 ), the formal (large n ) continuum limit a  0 of the
lagrangian l(a) yields

where c  o([g2]0) is some constant. remark that the localization (4.1)
does not necessarily implies that in the large n wc limit g2n  0 the
eective action (4.3) becomes quadratic in f 2
 . the a  0 limit in eq.
(4.5) may be omitted only when (r,{m}) > 0 for r  yn, n  3 .

finally, in d = 4 the renorm-group analysis ensures the existence and
uniqueness of the low-energy y m theory renormalizable in the dysons
sense (which is reassured by asymptotic freedom). that is why one may ex-
pect that d = 4 lattice gauge theories (4.3) belong to the same universality

class with the standard low-energy action r d4x tr[f 2
4.1 the {u  1} localization.

ef f .

in the particular case of gauge theories induced via (1.9) from the eigenvalue-
systems (1.6), the required localization of u(z) is predetermined by the
localization (2.12) of the link-variables u in the reduced model (1.15). for
deniteness, the eective 1-matrix system in the representation (1.19) of
(1.15) is supposed to be restricted to (1.20). let us demonstrate that the
{u  1} localization (2.12) holds true provided the saddle-point values
i = n (0)

in (1.20) approach innity according to the scaling -condition

(4.6)

with a functional g({gk}) approaching zero. to match with the localization
(4.1), g({gk}) in the above equation should be the same as in (4.4).

to begin with, we sketch under what conditions on the (rescaled accord-
ing to (3.17) coupling constants br({p}) of the) eective model (1.20) the
constraint (4.6) is dynamically fullled. as for the overall o(n) -scaling of

18

{(0)} , it has been demonstrated in section 3. this scaling is further aug-
mented in the wc domain when all the parameters tend to zero: {br  0} .
in this case the large n limit of the discrete u(n) model (3.20) coincides
with the corresponding hermitean model in the eigenvalue-representation
associated via substitution (3.17)

(4.7)

where s({}|{br}) = s({n }|{brn r}) + 2pi<k ln|i  k| . one observes
that the sums {}  [zn]n over the independent integer-valued {} -
elds are transformed into the corresponding integrals over the real-valued
variables j  o(n 0) . complementary, in the wc domain the constraints
(3.4) in eq. (3.15) are irrelevant and can be omitted.

defering the demonstration of these facts till the next subsection, we
employ the w c representation (4.7) to clarify the mechanism of the residual
[g2n]1/2 scaling of |(0)
| and relate the latter to the localization (2.12). in
the simplest case of the u(n) action (1.20) with m0 = 1 , one simply sets

where gr0  o(1/n) and r0 = [21] . rescaling the eigenvalues j =
, we are
[gn
left with the g2n - independent theory of eigenvalues hj that altogether
ensures (4.6). in a general situation (3.17), similar arguments hold true pro-
vided that all br scale to zero as in (4.7). choosing b2k = lim inf [br] as
the smallest br({p}) in the subset of r  y2k for each particular k , one is to
equate gn

4

2 with the lim inf [(b2k)

1

2k ] selected among all k  m0 .

now we are ready to make contact between the scaling (4.6) and the
localization {u  1} of eq. (2.12). recall that, according to eq. (3.2), the
irreps r in eq. (3.15) represent the irreps {r()} entering the glr fusion-
rules (1.17). the latter ensure that the scaling-condition (4.6) is valid also
for {(0)()} parametrizing the sp irreps {r(0)()} on which the large
n sum (1.15), dening the reduced model, is localized (after integration over
{u} ). combining it with (4.7), one concludes that the eigenvalues j() of

19

u =  diag[ei()] +
 are localized (modulo (1.16)) in the domain where
[sr({u})  sr({1})]  o(n 2[g2n]0) when g2n  0 . according to the
weyl character formula (2.9), for any particular j it results in the large n
scaling complementary to (4.6)

lim

lim

(4.10)

for any given a, b = 1, ..., n . altogether, it justies the required dynamical
localization (2.12) in the reduced model (1.19)/(1.20) under the condition
g2n  0 .

let us now return to the localization (4.2) in the gauge theories induced
from the eigenvalue-systems (1.6) associated to the reduced models satisfying
(4.10). the pattern of the mapping (1.9) (together with the saddle-point
analysis of section 2) suggests that the functionals g({gk}) in eqs. (4.1) and
(4.10) are to be identied. to substantiate this identication, we consider the
large n wc asymptotics g2n  0 of the properly normalized partitition
function (pf)

x (in)

ld = z y{,z}

du(z)exp[s({u(z)})  s({1})]

(4.11)

for a (induced) gauge theory on a cubic lattice with ld sites. as the con-
struction (4.11) excludes the factor es({1}) irrelevant for the contribution of
the wc perturbative series, in the limit g2n  0 the pf x (in)
ld yields the
leading order of the large n (g2n) -expansion.

consider a generic gauge theory (4.3) with the localization (4.2) im-
posed through the pattern (4.4). then the wc asymptotics of (4.11) is
predetermined by the g2n -scaling law of the measure i.e. active haar link-
integrations remaining after a gauge xing. this is simply because the exclu-
sion of the es({1}) -factor guarantees that the overall action [s({u(z)}) 
s({1})] is  o(n 2[g2n]0) when g2n  0 . as for the haar measure scal-
ing, consider rst a cubic ld lattice with the free boundary conditions for

20

u(z) . one observes that in the limit l   the maximal tree gauge in
the average excludes at each site one link-integration out of the total amount
d . the latter is clear if one imposes (almost complete when l   )
temporal axial gauge keeping ud(z) = 1, z . each remaining active haar
integration merges, in the vicinity of 1 , with the at lebesgue measure
=1 dn 2a(z) . summarizing, for l   the localization (4.1) results in
qd1
the following large n wc asymptotics

2 ](d1)n 2ld

, c > 0 ,

(4.12)

where the r du = 1 normalization of the haar measure is used, and c is

a model dependent constant. finally, one can demonstrate that the above
pattern remains valid for a nite l provided the choice of the periodic bound-
ary conditions for u(z) . in the specic case of the wilsonian lattice action
(where in eq. (4.4) (n, m) = n  2 so that (4.12) results from a gaussian
integration) the above asymptotics was derived in [13].

summarizing, to justify the identication of the functionals g({gk}) in
eqs. (4.1) and (4.10), one is to prove that eq. (4.15) holds true for the gauge
theories induced from the reduced models constrained by (4.6). to begin
with, according to the mapping (1.9), the factor es({1}) can be rewritten as
the partitition function (pf) x (a)
ld of the auxiliary model. the latter is to
be computed in terms of the plaquatte-factor (1.6) where the substitution

u(z)  g+(z) g(z + )

(4.13)

is performed. consequently, the properly normalized pf of the induced gauge
theory can be representaed as the ratio

x (in)

ld = xld/x (a)

ld

(4.14)

where xld and x (a)
ld are the pfs (both normalized akin to (4.11)) associated
to the eigenvalue-system (1.6) and the auxiliary model dened through (4.13)
respectively.

as for the large n limit of xld , the correspondence (1.14) allows to
express it as ldth power of the pf xr of the reduced model (1.15). in
turn, the localization (4.10) results in the power -like asymptotics

lim

xr({gr}) = [b gn

, b > 0 ,

(4.15)

21

which is deduced similarly to (4.12) (while r du = 1 is presumed). comple-
mentary, one easily observes that the localization (2.12) in eigenvalue-system
(1.6) predetermines that in the auxiliary model (4.13) the su(n) eld g(z)
is localized (modulo (1.5)) in the vicinity of 1 as well. consequently, akin
to (4.15) one obtains

(4.16)

combining all the pieces together, we nally arrive at the required asymp-
totics (4.12) with g({gk}) being identical to the functional which enters the
scaling (4.6) in the associated reduced model.

4.2 the auxiliary continuum limits and n   pts.

the 1-matrix representation (3.15),(1.20) of the large n pf (1.17) allows,
for the rst time, to address analytically the d > 2 pattern of the phase
transitions (pts) in the su(n) gauge theories induced from the eigenvalue-
systems (1.6). in particular, the asymptotics (4.12) of x (in)
ld (and similar
power-like asypmtotics of x (in)
ld  ( xr)ld ) is characteristic of the phase
naturally refered to as the weak-coupling (wc) one. the latter is associated
to a connected vicinity of the wc domain {br  0} of the parameters
dening the eective 1-matrix system (1.20). on the other hand, the strong-
coupling (sc) phase (associated to a connected vicinity of {br  } ) can
be shown to correspond to a completely dierent pattern of x (in)
ld ({gk}) . to
take the simplest example, consider d = 2 (where the constraints (3.4) are
trivial) and choose the simplest 1-matrix model (4.8) with q = 2 . as it is
known [12], the large n free energy of the latter model can be expanded in
the sc series

 lim

n

ln[ x1(b)] = n 2

+

xn=1

m (n)

xm=0

f (n, m) b2mexp[nb2/2]

(4.17)

which reproduces the correct answer in a connected vicinity of b = g2n 
 .

the reason for the mismatch between the wc and sc large n patterns
resides in the phase transition(s) which are ubiquitous [5, 10] in the lattice

22

gauge systems. as we will see, in the case of the induced gauge theories,
it implies that the large n continuum limit (cl) encoded by (4.3)-(4.5) is
accompanied by a few auxiliary continuum limits in the eective 1-matrix
system (3.15). the latter are characterized by the transformation of a few
relevant discrete spaces into the corresponding continuum manifolds.

as previously, we concentrate on the simplest case when the 1-matrix
model in (3.15) reduces to the selected family (1.20). the appropriate frame-
work for our analysis is provided by the method based on the saddle-point
equations (originally introduced in [11]) in a particular realization close to
[4, 5]. first of all, let us demonstrate that in the large n limit the su(n)
d > 2 constraints (3.4) in eq. (3.15) are irrelevant and can be omitted. the
easiest way to see it is to notice rst that for a selfdual su(n) irrep

n(r)|r= r = n(1  n + 1)/2

(4.18)

so that, choosing n  2(d  1)z>0 , we satisfy (3.4) for {} . presuming
the smoothness of the large n limit, one arrives at the required conclusion.
actually, employing the regularized poisson resummation formula (3.13),
the irrelevance of (3.4) in the su(n) models can be explicitly proven with
the help of the formalism we now focus on to handle the eective 1-matrix
system (1.20).

as we demonstrated in section 3.2, the adjustment (3.17) of the {gk} -
scaling is sucient to ensure that the nite n sum (1.20) is accumulated
by the congurations {j} possessing a smooth large n limit both in the
index j -space and in the base {}  zn -space. then, in the computa-
tion of the leading o(n 2) order of ln( x1) the large n sum (1.20) can be
substituted by the corresponding path-integral

x1 = z d(t) exp(n 2sef f [(t)] )

(4.22)

sef f [(t)]

fulls d(0)(t)/dt  1 for t  [0, 1] , the u(n) pattern of (4.19) reduces
to that of the large n hermitean model associated to (1.20) via the corre-
spondence (4.7). as we will prove below, this reduction occurs in the w c
phase when the set {gr} = {br} belongs to a connected vicinity of {br  0} .
in the corresponding hermitean model, the 1/n quasiclassical expansion is
organized in the background of the saddle-point solution(s) (0)(t) . since
s({})  o(n 2) , the quantum uctuations of the continuum (t) -variables
can be neglected in the large n limit

lim
n

x1 = exp(n 2sef f [(0)(t)])

(4.23)

and the leading order of the semiclassical and that of the 1/n expansions
coincide . remark that, in the case associated to the su(n) system, we are
to impose the additional boundary condition (4.22). the latter matches
with the translational invariance i  i + m which must be present in the
( z2 -invariant) su(n) action s({su (n )}) dened by eq. (1.20).

one can show that the su(n) solution of (4.22),(1.20) does exists (pro-
vided the subset {gr, r  y2m0} has the signs consistent with the convergence
of the {} -series), being unique and z2 -invariant. in the u(n) -case the

out in the analysis of the o(n 2) -order of ln[ x1] ). in eect, it suces to

where p stands for the principle value of the integral over  , and the ad-

(4.27) for an arbitrary potential (4.26). it can be found e.g.
in the third
reference of [4] and will not be reviewed here. we note only that, in the
case of the simplest m0 = 1 u(n) model (4.8), the solution () of (4.27)
assumes the pattern of the wigner semicircle law

() =

(4.28)

which allows to reproduce the original descrete sum (1.20) for (2b2/q) < 2
(when () < 1 in the whole admissible domain of 2  2q/b2 ).
next, in the domain of {gr} where d(0)(t)/dt < 1 in a set of windows
t  k [ta(k), tb(k)] , the above strategy has to be rened. to be more specic,
consider again the simplest m0 = 1 u(n) model (4.8) (analysed at length
in [5]). when b2 > b2
cr = q2/2 , the solution (0)(t) is located partially
outside the admissible domain (4.21) as it is clear from (4.28). to reproduce
the original discrete model (4.8) with b2 > b2
cr , in (4.23) one is to substitute
(0)(t) by the closest boundary conguration  (0)(t) . the latter is to be
found presuming that

(4.29)

where the [z2] -sefduality prescribes that t1 + 1/2 = t2  1/2 . the choice
(4.29) implies simply that, for the indices j corresponding to the window
[t1, t2] , the number nj of boxes in the associated jth rows of y (n )
(con-
strained by ni  ni+1 ) assumes the  boundary  values ni = ni+1 = .. =
nn i = 0 . after substitution of (4.29) into the eective action (4.20), one
obtains a (modied compared with (4.22)) saddle-point equations for  (0)(t)
in the remaining domain t  [0, t1]  [t2, 1] .

practical computations are easier to perform translating the above con-
struction in terms of the spectral density (4.25) to be deformed ()  1 on
the interval   [1, 2] corresponding to (4.29). the turning on (4.29) of
the constraint (4.21) (being a nonanalytical procedure) results in the third
order phase transition [5]. note also that in the m0 > 1 case of (1.20)
there may be multicritical pattern with a few phase transitions associated to
opening or closing of a new window
in
[4]).

[ta(l), tb(l)] (see e.g. the third ref.

next, the above picture of pts allows to reinterprete the mismatch be-
tween the large n wc and sc patterns of the partitition function xld
(eqs.
(4.12) and (4.17) respectively) from the viewpoint of the auxiliary
continuum limits. to begin with, according to the identication (4.21) the
n   limit of the discrete index-space {i = 1, ..., n} is the continuum
time-manifold t . outside the wc domain, the large n system (4.19) still
retains the remnant of the discreteness (associated to the base zn -space)
which is encoded in the constraint (4.21). the subtlety is that the latter
constraint is relevant despite the fact that each particular large n sum over
a given j -species j  z merges with the integral over the real-valued vari-
able. finally, let us show that in the wc limit {br  0} the solution (0)(t)
doesnt violate condition (4.21).
in other words, all the involved discrete
spaces merge with the associated continuum manifolds which, in particular,
implies the validity of the large n reduction (4.7) of (1.20) in the whole
n   wc phase. indeed, the substitution (4.7) can be justied by going
2 ]j elds. having adjusted the
over to the eective theory of the j = [gn
proper scaling (3.17),(4.6) (i.e. g2n -independence of the large n j -system
in the wc limit), one obtains

1

d(t)/dt = [gn

1

2 ]1d(t)/dt  o(1/[gn

1

2 ]) >> 1

(4.30)

which substantiates the wc equivalence of (1.20) with the associated her-

26

mitean model.

in conclusion, it takes a minor modication of the above analysis to retain
explicitly the d > 2 su(n) constraints (3.4) built into the eective 1-
matrix model (1.19). employing the representation (3.15) of the latter, one
can demonstrate that the free energy n 2fef f (p, p) (evaluated prior to the
sum over p, p  z ) assumes the form
en 2[fef f (p,p)fef f (0,0)] = lim
0

p,[d1]k .

(4.31)

lim
n

ep2

p,0 xkz

as a result, the localization {p = 0; p = 0 mod [d  1]z} proves that the
constraints (3.4) can be safely omitted in (1.19), (3.15) when n   .

summarizing, the large n continuum limit (cl) in the proposed induced
lattice gauge theories is accompanied by the two auxiliary cls. the latter,
being predetermined (in the reduced system (3.15)) by the correspondence
(3.19) and the scaling (4.6), are associated to the n   transformation
of the discrete j -index space and {}  zn space into the corresponding
continuum manifolds. in turn, it foreshadows the irrelevance of the d > 2
constraint (3.4) in the limit n   . together with the large n reduction
(1.14), it results in the substantial simplication of the large n wc analysis.
as for the physical interpretation of the discussed phase pattern, it can be
understood relating the large n pts to the issue of the validity of the
wc and the sc expansions in the associated wc {br  0} and the sc
{br  } domains respectively. we expect also that, among the phase
transitions (passing from the wc to the sc limits), there is one associated
to the condensation of the microscopic lattice monopoles which are always
present in the lattice gauge theories.

5 remarks about the d=2 case.

to begin with, consider the d = 2 large n average of some nonself-
intersecting wilson loop (1.7) for which a closed expression can be derived.
the appropriate method is a minor modication of the combinatorial ap-
proach due to migdal [9] (see also [4, 8]) developed in the context of the
ordinary 2d gauge theories.

27

owing to the periodic boundary conditions the 2d l2 -plane in question
is made, topologically, into a discretized 2-tora. let l   so that any
nite-size loop c does not coincide with one of the two uncontractible cycles
dening the tora. consequently, cutting along the contour c , this tora is
decomposed into the two disjoint connected componenets: a disk with area
a and the complementary disk with one handle of the area l2  a . to ap-
ply cutting-gluing technique, rst one is to introduce (as in [8]) the so-called
disc-amplitudes zg( a, lc|{u(zk)}) . the latter is dened as the partitition
function of the d = 2 eigenvalue-theory (1.6) on a disk of the area a with
a given number of handles g . the boundary-contour c is supposed to con-
sist of lc k -links, each being endowed with a f ree boundary conditions
introduced via the associated link-variables uk (zk), k = 1, ..., lc .

a particular term of each dening factor (1.6), being refered to a  -
plaquette based at z , assigns to this plaquette one of the su(n) irreps
r(z)  r(z) . the specics in the computation of the 2d disc-amplitudes
is that zg(a, lc|{u(zk)}) can be evaluated with the help of the orthonor-
mality condition for the lie group characters

l(2)

r1|r2

= z dv r1(v ) r2(v +) = r1,r2,

(5.1)

corresponding to the simplest glr coecient of the second order while the
higher order l(p)
r+|{rk}, p  3, are not involved. given the amplitude associ-
ated to a particular connected base-surface, eq. (5.1) prescribes that r(z)
is z - independent . as a result, thus introduced disk-amplitude is readily
computed in the g - independent form

zg(a|{u(zk)}) = xr

es(r)a y{zkc}

r(uk(zk))

(5.2)

where {zk} stands for the set of lc sites on the boundary c . as a cross-
check, the d = 2 partitition function xl2 can be easily rewritten in terms
of zg(aq|{u(zk)}) (where a1 = a , a2 = l2  a )

xl2 = z y{zk}

duk (zk) z0(a1|{u +(zk)}) z1(a2|{u(zk)})

which, owing to (5.2) and (2.5), results in

that matches with the d = 2 case of (1.17) according to (5.1). remark that
the same expression comes out in the case of the l2 -surface of an arbitrary
genus g .

next, similarly to the ordinary 2d lattice gauge theories, the wilson loop

average in the 2d system (1.6) reads

< w r0

c >= z y{zk}

duk(zk)z0(a1|{u +(zk)})z1(a2|{u(zk)})

r0(uc)

(5.5)

where uc = q{zk} uk(zk) , r0 is the representation of the holonomy. eval-
uating (5.5) one is to take advantage of the fact that zg(a|{u(zk)}) is
independent of the angular variables (zk) . equivalently, it can be repre-
sented as the invariance of zg( a|{u(zk)}) with respect to the [u(n)]lc
conjugations

,

vk(zk)  u(n) ,

(5.6)

(where k = 1, ..., lc ) inherited from the symmetry (1.3) of the factor (1.6).
let us perform the substitution (5.6) as a change of the variables in eq. (5.5)
that leaves the measure invariant. integrating over vk(zk) with the haar
measure and employing the identity

v +(zk)uk (zk)v (zk)) = q{zk} r0(uk (zk))

[dimr0]lc 1

,

(5.7)

dv (zp)r0(y{zk}

z y{zp}
one trades the factor r0(q{zk} uk (zk)) for the properly normalized product

of the characters (akin to (1.2)). at the same time, the rest of the integrated
in (5.5) expression is left intact. remark that in eq. (5.7) the [dimr0]1lc
normalization can be deduced making the particular choice of the arguments:
uk (zk) = 1, k .

after {dv (zp)} integrations, a generic loop average (1.7) in the eigen-
value systems can be expressed in terms of the grl coecients (2.2). for a
nonself-intersecting contour c one obtains

which complements the glr pattern of the partitition function. observe
that the same glr pattern (1.8) of < w f
c > immediately follows from (5.7)
in any d  2 . finally, < w r0
c > can be rewritten in a more conventional
form of the average

blc (r|r0, a) = xr1

e[s(r1)s(r)]a [lr1|r,r0]lc

[dimr0]lc 1 .

(5.10)

remark that eqs. (5.9),(5.10) remain valid in the case of a generic nonself-
intersecting contour c on a discretized 2d surface of an arbitrary genus
(provided c is not homotopic to any of dening uncontractible cycles).

building on the results of [14] (obtained in the context of the continuum
y m2 on a 2d sphere), one can derive the integral representation for (5.9) in
terms of the associated spectral density (4.25). for simplicity, we consider
the option when es(r) belongs to the u(n) subvariety (4.26) of the family
(1.20). also, we restrict our attention to the segment of the w c domain of
{gr} = {br} where the spectral density is less than 1/2 for all admissible  .
then, as it is demonstrated in appendix b, the large n average < w f
c >
of a nonself-intersecting loop c in the fundamental representation assumes
the form

,

(5.11)

< w f

c >= n 2lc z d ()  sin(())

() !qa

where () < 1/2 is the z2 -invariant solution of the sp eq. (4.27). we
postpone the interpretation of the unconventional n 2lc -scaling of the av-
erage (5.11) till the next section and now turn to the issue of the continuum
limit (cl).

5.1

identication of the universality class.

to study the cl of (5.11) directly, one is to send l2, a to innity keep-
ing a/l2 nite. simultaneously, the coupling constant b2 = g2
r n (entering

30

(4.6)) should approach the critical value b2 = 0 (corresponding to the lo-
calization (2.12)). it is to be performed in accordance with such scaling-law
which ensures a f inite physical string tension  as b2  0 . let the total
area of the closed 2d surface in question, being measured in the units of
1 , is adjusted to be nite as well. take the g = 0 case, the 2d sphere,
where the free energy of continuum y m2 is  o(n 2) . then thus dened
b2  0 limit of the (area-dependent part of) the g = 0 amplitude (5.11) is
to be compared with its continuum counterpart. the latter can be directly
computed with the help of the self-reproducing lattice theory [9, 8] dened
via the plaquette-factor (1.1) with

ef (r) = dimr exp[f ({ck(r)})] .

(5.12)

here f ({ck(r)}) is some function of the casimir operators ck(r), k =
1, ..., n, which parametrizes a particular generalized y m2 [8]. note that
the q = 1 case of the family (1.20) represents the polynomial subvariety of
(5.12) for the particular choice of u = 1 .

the identication of f ({ck(r)}) , corresponding to a given eigenvalue-
system (1.6), would determine the universality class to which the associated
induced lattice gauge theory belongs.
instead of addressing this question
directly, we will nd a lattice gauge theory (1.1) which is supposed to have
the same cl (in a nite physical 2-volume) as the model (1.6) in question.
for this purpose, in the innite lattice-volume limit l2, a   we identify
the pairs of the large n gauge- and eigenvalue-systems for which the large
a loop-averages are the same for generic values of the relevant coupling
constant(s) {br} .

to begin with, from the results of [4, 8], one readily deduces for the

disc-amplitude associated to (1.1)

zg(a|uc) = xr

(dimr)12g ek(r)a r(uc) ,

(5.13)

where k(r) = f (r) + ln(dimr), . to make a crosscheck, one observes that
for the heat-kernal action (1.1) (with f ({ck(r)})  c2(r) ) eq. (5.13) re-
produces the canonical expression derived in [4, 8]. compared to the pattern
(5.2), the above formula contains the topological piece (dimr)12g (which is
a -independent) and depends on the eigenvalues of the single holonomy uc .

31

as a result, the large n partitition function x (g)
of genus g assumes the form

l2 on a discretized surface

lim

nxr

(dimr)

= [ xr

2l2 e k(r)

2

]2l2

,

(5.14)

where the weight k(r) is supposed to be consistent with the o(n 2) -scaling
of ln[ x (g)
l2 ] . to be more specic, in what follows we concentrate on the case
when ef (r) in eq. (1.1) is restricted to the family (1.20). for a preliminary
determination of the pairing, one observes that the pattern (5.14) precisely
matches with that of eq. (5.4) provided the identication

f (r) + ln(dimr)  k(r) = s(r) , l2   , g ,

(5.15)

complemented by the innite lattice-volume limit. to ensure that the free
energy (in both (1.1) and in the associated via (5.15) eigenvalue-system (1.6))
is  o(n 2) , one is to require that the pattern (1.20) of ef (r) satises
q > max[(1  (2  2g)/2l2) ; 1] . note also that, in the g = 1 case of the
2-tora, the matching (5.15) accidentally holds true for any nite l2 as well.

next, consider an arbitrary nonself-intersecting loop c of the area a on
a generic discretized 2d surface of genus g with the total area l2 . for
simplicity, we restrict our attention to the case when, after cutting along the
contour c , the disc of the area a has zero number of handles. employing
[4, 8], one derives

(5.16)

dimr1
dimr

e[k(r1)k(r)]a lr1|r,r0 .

(5.17)

to simplify the comparison with (5.9), in what follows r0 is selected to
be the fundamental irrep f . according to the representation theory [6], it
substantially reduces the pattern of the glr fusion rules

{lr1|r,f = 1 or 0} = (lr1|r,f )lc = lr1|r,f

(5.18)

which makes the relevant analysis particularly transparent. combining (5.18)
with the identication (5.15), one observes that the peculiar renormaliza-
tion of the perimeter-law by the factor (dim f )1lc = n 1lc is the only

32

dierence between (5.9) and (5.16) in the limit l2, a   . more precisely,
denote the eective actions in the integral representation (akin to eq. (5.11))
for the loop-average

< w f

c >= n hk(lc )z dh eb(k)

ef f (h|a,{br})

(5.19)

by b(k)
ef f (h|a,{br}) where k = 1, 2 stand for the options (5.9) and (5.16)
respectively, and h1(l) = 2  l, h2(l) = 1 . according to the explicit
form (1.20) of es(r) = ek(r) , the large a limit lima s(k)
ef f (h|a,{br}) is
k -independent for generic values of {br} . to be more specic, consider the
continuum limit b2  0 and take the m0 = 1 u(n) model (4.8). in the
limit b2   the spectral density (4.28) tends to zero: ()  o(b) . as it
is clear from appendix b, this scaling of () implies that [dimr1/dimr] 
1 + o(b2) (for admissible 2 < 2q/b2 and the characteristic values of r ).
in other words, the [dimr1/dimr] -dependent mismatch between (5.10) and
(5.17) is expected to be irrelevant in the continuum limit.

upon a reection, the above correspondence between (5.9) and (5.16)
suggests the following equivalence. the gauge system (on a sphere of a
f inite physical 2-volume) induced from (1.6) and the associated ordinary
gauge theory (1.1) in d = 2 have one and the same continuum limit (cl)
provided the identication (5.15). to justify the general consistency of this
statement, we observe rst that once the localization (2.12) takes place in
the 2d system (1.6) then similar localization (with the same scaling) is valid
in (1.1) associated via (5.15). the converse statement is also true. this
correspondence between the localizations follows from the specic relation
(5.15) between the pair of the weights ef (r) and es(r) . to make it man-
ifest, one simply needs to change the variables going over from j - to the
j = ([gn

2 ]j/n) -elds like in eq. (4.30).

1

next, the localization in the ordinary d = 2 lattice gauge theory indeed
implies that the latter theory approaches the continuum. it is predetermined
by the absence of the propagating degrees of freedom in the 2d gauge systems
so that the renorm-group anomalous dimensions vanish. to see how it works,
introduce the innitesimal lattice spacing a and some f inite parameter

   responsible for the physical mass-scale. then, given the localization-

pattern (4.4) of the lattice action (4.3), the judiciously adjusted scaling

a = ba , b = a ;

b2l2 = const ,

lim
a0

(5.20)

33

in the limit a  0 is supposed to directly provide with the pattern of the
continuum gauge action associated to the corresponding low-energy theory
of (1.1).

finally, the equivalence of the cl in (1.6) and (1.1) is tantamount to the
equivalence of the eective theories for the low-frequency modes of b . the
perimeter-type lc -dependent terms, among other things, are responsible for
the details of the short -distance attachment of the colour-electric ux to the
external wilson loop source. as such, they may be sensitive to the details
of the discretization (of both the space-time and the action) that in our case
is reected by the mismatch in hk(lc) of eq. (5.19). on the contrary, in
the cl limit (5.20) (keeping a/l2 nite), the bulk (b2l2), (b2a) -dependent
terms in both (5.9) and (5.16) are supposed to be low-energy quatities insen-
sitive to the lattice discretization.

formally, one could consider instead of a single loop average the so-called

creutz ratios (see e.g. [13]) of the products of the averages

< w f
< w f

c1 >< w f
c3 >< w f

c2 >
c4 >

, l+ = lc1 + lc2 = lc3 + lc4,

(5.21)

where the pairs of the contours {c1, c2} and {c3, c4} are constrained to
have the same overall perimeter l+ . being originally designed to cancel
exactly the short-distance perimeter-type contributions, the ratios are evi-
dently insensitive to the dierence in hk(lc) of eq. (5.19). altogether, the
above general arguments are consistent with the presumable equivalence of
the universality class to which the latter pairs of the ordinary and the induced
2d gauge theories belong. note also that, in the case of a generic irrep r0 ,
the mismatch between the patterns (5.9) and (5.16) includes additionally the
perimeter-type contribution owing to the dierent powers of lr1|r,r0 . as
it is clear from the above discussion, this piece of the answer is irrelevant
for the determination of the universality class (even for a nite n ) which is
consistent with the previous consideration based on the identication (5.15).

6 the large n pattern of the loop-averages.

building on the readily computable case of the d = 2 eigenvalue-systems
(1.6), let us now discuss the general pattern of the large n scaling including

34

self-intersecting contours and multi-loop averages. we will argue in partic-
ular that, in the gauge theories induced from (1.6), the standard large n
factorization takes place. the scaling of a generic irreducible interaction be-
tween a number of wilson contours is also considered.
in conclusion, we
comment on peculiar reasons behind the unconventional n   scaling
(5.11)

of the average of a single nonself-intersecting loop (1.7).

it is instructive to begin with the pattern of the irreducible interactions
between a given number of nonintersecting, nonself-intersecting wilson loops
cp, p = 1, ..., b, on a particular 2d discretized surface of the area l2 . as
usual, the corresponding amplitudes are dened by the irreducible correlators

they are deduced from the ordinary b -loop correlators < qb

subtraction of all lower order reducible contributions as prescribed by the
standard cluster expansion. one may presume that the pattern (4.3),(4.4) is
universal for a wide class of the lattice gauge theories (and in particular for
the family (1.1) with ef (r) given by (1.20)) with the free energy  o(n 2) .
then, provided the absence of unnatural cancellation between individual
diagrams, the t hooft double-line representation (for the large n wc series)
yields the topological expansion in the form

the large n strong coupling expansion on a lattice.

in the ordinary 2d gauge system (1.1) and in the eigenvalue-model (1.6) asso-

will be clear in the continuum limit) by the perimeter-type factors

with w(b, h)  o(n 0) .

to demonstrate (6.4), we rst cut the surface along the set {cp} of the
contours that results in a set of disjoint 2d windows. let the q th window
have the area aq being endowed with certain number bq of boundary discs
and that gq of handles. similarly to the simplest b = 1 case (5.2), one
evaluates the corresponding bq -disc amplitude

by the same token as in eq. (5.5), the b -loop correlator < qb

is to be composed from the associated amplitudes (6.5) (or (6.6) respectively)
performing the remaining haar integrations over {u(z(p)
k )} . apparently, this
procedure can be visualized then as gluing the above windows back so that
their boundaries sandwitch properly the loops w f
involved. thus, the
cp
only dierence between the ordinary 2d gauge theory and the associated
2d eigenvalue-system is in the mismatch between the patterns of the multi-
disc factors (6.5) and (6.6). the most transparent situation arises in the
continuum limit (5.20) when all ratios aq/l2 are kept nite. a minor mod-
ication of the arguments (see section 5.1) suggests that, in this limit, the

evaluated in terms of the associated multi-disc amplitudes (6.5) and (6.6)
respectively. presuming the smoothness of the continuum limit, one may
expect that (6.4) remains valid for generic values of aq and the coupling
constants. in particular it implies that in the eigenvalue-systems, despite the
unconventional perimeter-dependence (6.1), the large n factorization of the
loop-correlators remains present.

turning to the average associated to a single self-intersecting contour,
we rst consider self-intersections on a nite number of sites. the simplest
example is the eight-gure loop (two-leaf ower) c (2) = c1(x0)  c2(x0)
composed of the two nonself-intersecting contours ck(x0), k = 1, 2, which
share the single site x0 in common. similarly, one constructs a contour
c (m) = m
k=1ck(x0) with the topology of m -leaf ower based at x0 . em-
ploying the eigenvalue-representation (5.7), one observes that for such con-
tour the loop-average is not an irreducible correlator

in contrast to the pattern of conventional gauge theories. upon a reec-
tion, the large n scaling (6.8) holds true for the average of an arbitrary
loop (1.7) which after removing all the sites with self-intersections is split-
ted into m disjoint nonself-intersecting contours ck . complementary, af-
ter subtraction of all the higher-order reducible parts (contributing as 
o(n 2+ppm
k=1 lck ), p > 0 ) the irreducible correlator (6.2) of m th order is
supposed to obey (6.1). in particular, for m = 2 we expect that

(6.9)

in the case of a contour with self-intersections along links, the associated
average generically is not irreducible either. the additional reason here is

37

the existence of the (irreducible) one-link correlators (with rk  y (n )

(6.10)

which depend nontrivially on the relevant coupling constants {br} . as a
result, the scaling (6.1) is generically modied as well.

6.1 comments on the local large n [zn]d -symmetry.

factor (qb

next, let us return to the interpretation of the unconventional pattern (6.1)
of a nonself-intersecting loop average in the gauge theories induced from
the eigenvalue-systems (1.6). from the viewpoint of the generic pattern
(4.3),(4.4) of the matrix theories with the o(n 2) free energy, the scaling
(6.1) indicates the additional n 1lc -suppression. in the more general case
(6.4), the corresponding irreducible average is down in magnitude by the
p=1 n 1lcp ) . one might expect that (in the wc phase) the latter
is the result of a specic cancellation between dierent feynman diagrams
(each scaling individually in compliance with the standard pattern (6.3)). as
this cancellation is not manifest within the formal wc series, we have to
return to the specics of the original eigenvalue-models. as we will see, in the
p=1 n 1lcp ) -factor
framework of the saddle-point (sp) method, the extra (qb
[zn]d -symmetry
can be traced back to the otherwise unobservable local
(2.11) of the leading o(n 2) order of the eective action sef f ({(0)}) (see
eq. (2.6)) restricted to the sp orbit {(0)} .

to this aim observe rst that, were not the invariance (2.11), in the aver-
age of the product (1.8) each trace could be substituted in the large n limit
by its sp value f ((0)(k|zk)) (modulo (1.5) and the zn gauge transfor-
mations (1.4) both invisible for a closed loop c ). altogether, it would result
in the conventional o(n) -scaling and trivial perimeter-law pattern of the
large n loop-average (1.7). it is the additional averaging over the [zn]d -
orbit (2.11) which ensures that (in the eigenvalue-systems (1.6)) the leading
o(n) contribution to < w f
c > is exactly cancelled. indeed, assume for a
moment that one would neglect completely the subleading o(n 1),   0,
orders of sef f ({()}) in eq. (2.6). in this approximation, the uctuations
(in the background of the sp orbit (0)(k|zk) generated by (1.4), (1.5) and

38

(2.10)) induced by the innitesimal transformations (2.11) become exactly
zero modes. the contribution of these modes would render an arbitrary
correlator (1.8) identically zero for any nonself-intersecting loop c

< w f

c > n 1lc y{zklc } xt(zk)zn

t(zk) f ((0)(k|zk)) = 0

(6.11)

because such w f
the [zn]d -averaging over t(zk)  zn .

c does not contain the singlet component with respect to

the inclusion of the subleading orders of sef f ({()}) breaks (2.11)
down to (1.4), (1.5) which makes the above modes quasizero.
in turn, it
justies that the large n loop-averages (associated to a nonself-intersecting
contour) are nonvanishing. on the other hand, the cancellation (6.11) in-
deed foreshadows the n 1lc -suppressed scaling (6.1). to make it manifest,
consider the 2-loop average

< |w f

c|2 > o(n 2) ,

(6.12)

with |w f
c|2 being invariant under (2.11). as it is clear from the sp method,
the leading o(n 2) -order of (6.12) is accumulated (in contrast to the ordi-
nary gauge theories) by the reducible part composed of the n1 = n2 = 1
correlators (6.10). this substantiates that the n   average (1.7) is
necessarily suppressed compared to the conventional b = 1 o(n) -pattern
(6.3).

7 conclusions.

in this paper we have proposed to induce a class of su(n) lattice gauge
theories from the novel family of the vector-eld eigenvalue-models (1.6) (or
their generalizations) employing the mapping (1.9). the latter models, in
addition to the local [u(n)]d conjugation-invariance (1.3), are endowed with
the zn gauge symmetry (1.4) and global [zn]d invariance (1.5). the crucial
consequence of (1.3) is that both the action (1.6) and the wilson loop
averages (1.8) depend nontrivially only on the eigenvalues (k|zk) of the
relevant link-variables.

39

consequently, both the partitition function xld (composed of (2.1))
and the loop-averages (1.8) can be rewritten in terms of the glr coe-
cients (2.2) parametrized by o(n) integers. in turn, the 1/n expansion
of both the free energy and (1.8) can be reformulated as the semiclassical
series provided that ln[ xld ]  o(n 2) . in this perspective, the eigenvalue-
models (1.6) facilitate a master-eld representation of the associated induced
gauge systems. recall also that in any literally continuum system the local
conjugation-invariance (1.3) is not consistent (even at the classical level)
with the presence of any f inite number of derivative-dependent terms in
the action. thus, from the viewpoint of the continuum y m theory, the
invariance (1.3) of (1.6) is to be interpreted as the huge auxiliary symme-
try introduced by the judicious discretization (regularization) of both the
action and the space-time.

in the large n limit, the partition function of (1.6) is reproduced (via
(1.14)) by the ( ld th power of the) reduced generating functional (1.17) of
the glr coecients which can be further transformed into the 1-matrix
representation (1.19). to be even more specic, the 1-matrix eigenvalue-
model in (1.19) is selected in the simplest form (1.20) which makes accessible
the complete large n phase structure of the d  2 induced gauge theories.
in particular, we pay the special attention to the issue of the continuum limit
(cl) in the latter theories. the important place in this analysis is played by
the scaling-condition (4.6), imposed on the eective 1-matrix system (1.19).
as it is demonstrated, this condition predetermines that in the induced gauge
system the localization {u(z)  1} of the link-variables takes place which is
tantamount to cl. also the phenomenon of the auxiliary continuum limits
is discussed.

the computation of the large n wilson loop averages < w f

c > is par-
ticularly simple in the d = 2 case where the concise representation (5.11) is
derived for generic nonself-intersecting loop c on an arbitrary 2d surface.
building on the transparent relation with < w f
c > evaluated in the ordinary
2d gauge theories, we reveal the peculiar modication (6.4) of the standard
pattern (6.3) of the 1/n -topological expansion. however the physical mass-
scale (like the string tension in (5.11)) is adjusted to scale as o(n 0) , and the
large n factorization is expected to remain present. therefore, we conclude
that the additional n 1lc -suppression (6.1) does not prevent to consider
the induced gauge systems as the elligible large n cousins of the conven-

40

tional su(3) lattice gauge theories. moreover, it is reasonable to expect
that the o(n 0) physical string tension (if any) in the induced lattice y m
system reproduces that in the associated continuum large n y m theory.
it is supported, in particular, by the explicit d = 2 derivations of section
5.1.

denitely, the most ambitious goal of our project is to nd an approach
for computation of the d = 4 large n loop-averages in the proposed in-
duced systems adjusted to have the proper continuum limit. if successful, it
might provide with the framework appropriate to address the issue of con-
nement in the standard d = 4 continuum su(n) theory in the limit
n   . unfortunately, the d = 2 technique of section 5, being directly
generalized to d  3 , does not seem to provide with a practical scheme.
more promising direction is to synthesize the latter technique with the 1/n
saddle-point method applied to the eigenvalues (k|zk) employing the ap-
propriate representation (1.8) of limn < w f
c > . the actual analysis in
this framework is additionally complicated by the presence of the quasizero
modes associated to the [zn]d symmetry (2.11) of the leading o(n 2) order
of the eective action sef f ({(0)}) (dened by eq. (2.6)) restricted to the
sp orbit {(0)} . as a result, even in the computation of limn < w f
c >
it looks necessary to take into account the subleading orders of sef f ({}) .
nevertheless, one might expect that the presumable large n factorization
(6.4) foreshadows potential simplications. clearly, it calls for a new piece
of technology to be developed.

appendix a: the local [zn ]d -invariance.

in this appendix we discuss the local [zn ]d -symmetry (2.11) of the leading
o(n 2) order of the eective action sef f ({(0)}) (dened in eq. (2.6)) re-
stricted to the sp values {(0)} . owing to s(d(d1)/2) invariance (1.13),
it sues to consider the simpler version of the su(n) plaquette-factor (1.6)
with the sum running over the single species r2

z({()}) = xr2

es(r2) y{}

r2((|x))... r2((|x)),

(a.1)

where s(r2) = s( r2) and   z   .

our purpose is to demonstrate that the su(n) sp solution (0)() is

supposed to be unique and z2 -selfdual (where r(()) = [r(())]+ )

(0)
j () = (0)

n j+1()  (0)

j () mod s(n)  [zn]d ,

(a.2)

modulo the weyl s(n) group (2.10) combined with the [zn]d transfor-
mations (2.11). to this aim, one rst observes that the factor (a.1) is by
construction z2 selfdual z({()}) = z +({()}) = z({()}) . it implies
that on the sp orbit, generated by the relevant symmetries to be determined,
there is a point corresponding to a z2 selfdual (modulo (2.10)) solution
{(0)()} . consider the sp suborbit generated from the above z2 invariant
solution by the (local) weyl group (2.10). in this case, the corresponding
stronger version of the constraint (a.2) is tantamount to the reality of the
character r(()) = [r(())]+ for any (not necessarily selfdual) irrep
r . in turn, the latter property is sucient for the selfconsistency of the local-
ization (3.1) on r(0)
: otherwise the eective action sef f (r2|{()})
for r2

2

esef f (r2|{()}) = z({()})

(a.3)

2 = r(0)
xr2

would not be z2 -selfdual with respect to the interchange r2  r2 .
now we are in a position to prove [zn]d transformations (2.11) of the
above s(n) suborbit {(0)()}s(n ) . let us introduce the twisted action
sef f (r2, t|{()}) , resulting (akin to (a.3)) from eq. (a.1) after the [zn]d -
deformation of the characters r(v ) involved,

r(v )  r(tv ) = tn(r)r(v ) ;
42

t = ei 2m

n  zn , r  y (n )
n(r),

(a.4)

(where n(r) is dened by (3.5)) so that z({()})  z({()}, t) . we
claim that sef f (r2, t|{(0)()}) remains to be z2 -selfdual
sef f (r2, t|{(0)()}) = sef f ( r2, t|{(0)()})

(a.5)

2 (t) = r(0)

2 (1)  r(0)

provided that {(0)()}  {(0)()}s(n ) , i.e.
fulls the stronger version
of (a.2) where the [zn]d group is omitted. moreover, we assert that (for
such {(0)()} ) the resulting from (a.4) sum (a.3) over su(n) irreps r2
is localized for t  zn on the same r(0)
as before
[zn]d -twisting. in turn, it is evidently tantamount to the invariance of the
leading o(n 2) order of sef f ({(0)}) (dened by eq. (2.6)) under (2.11).
to prove these statements, one notes rst that the explicit form (3.7)
of z2 transformation yields exp(n(r)ln[t]) = exp(n( r)ln[t]) . as only
the real part of the overall twist-factor contributes into z({()}, t) , the
= 0
latter identity justies (a.5).
see (4.22)) it implies that the saddle-point irrep is supposed to be selfd-
ual r(0)
2 (1) , we
employ the elligibility to restrict the large n twisted sum (a.3) to that
over su(n) selfdual irreps r2 = r2 for which n1 = 2pn
i=1 i  [2z0]
tn(r2) = exp[i(1  n + 1)] . finally, combination of the latter
so that
equation with the choice n  [2z0 + 1] results in 1  [2z0] so that
tn(r2) = 1 . presuming the smoothness of the large n limit, it substanti-
ates t -independence of r(0)

2 (t) irrespectively of t . to justify r(0)

in the su(n) case (where su (n )

2 (t) = r(0)

2 (t) = r(0)

appendix b: the d = 2 loop-averages.

consider the large n d = 2 average (5.9) of a nonself-intersecting wil-
son loop in the case when r0 = f and the weight es(r) belongs to the
u(n) subvariety (4.26) of the pattern (1.20). to begin with, as we will see
in a moment the factor blc (r|f, a) scales as o(n 2lc ) provided the in-
tegers j (dening r({}) ) are of order of  o(n) in the limit n   .
we assert that the large n sum in eq. (5.9) is localized on the solution
r({(0)})  r((0)(t)) of the sp equations (4.22). indeed, recall rst that
a (unique, z2 -selfdual) r(0)  r({(0)}) is the irrep on which the large n
sum (5.4) (dening the partitition function) is localized. it is reasonable to

43

presume that, for |(0)

j  j|  o(n ) , there is such  > 0 that
 o(n ) ,

|blc (r({(0)})|f, a)  blc (r({})|f, a)|

blc (r({(0)})|f, a)

(b.1)

i.e. blc (r({})|f, a) behaves smoothly on the scale of the characteristic
uctuations of j . altogether, it justies the above assertion.

next, one is to derive an explicit form of blc (r(0)|f, a) in terms of the
associated spectral density (4.25). the representation theory [6] tells that
lr1|r(0),f is nonzero when the associated to r1 (double) young table can
be obtained from that corresponding to r(0) by adding a single box in an
admissible way. the latter addition is elligble into the i th row if and only
if the number of boxes ni
in this row (see eq. (3.5)) is strictly less than in
the preceeding one

ni < ni1  (i1  i)  2 .

(b.2)

according to the denitions (4.21) and (4.25) of d(t)/dt and () , it implies
that in the domain of the coupling constant(s) where 0  ()  1/2, , the
box can be generically added to any row of the young table corresponding
to () = (dt/dh(0)(t))|h(0)(t)= . indeed, owing to (b.1) one can choose any
j /n, j = 1, ..., n, of the continuous function (0)(t) =
discretization (0)
| << n . condition () 
h(0)(t) + 1/2 which satises |n (0)(j/n) (0)
1/2 evidently ensures the existence of at least one such discretization obeying
(b.2).

j

due to (4.30), the constraint ()  1/2 is always fullled in the large
n wc limit {br  0} relevant for the analysis of the continuum limit.
therefore in what follows, we will restrict our attention to the cases when
()  1/2 and thus (b.2)) is valid. as a result, (by the same token as in
[14]) one obtains

e[s(r1)s(r(0))]alr1|r(0),f = z d () [t ()]qa e dv ()

where we have skipped the upperscript: h(0)(t)  h(t) . in the derivation of

the young table associated to r(0) ) then

(b.6)

where v (r({})) is dened by eq. (4.26).

the remaining step is to nd the continuum representation for t () in
terms of () . for this purpose, one is to expand the logarithm in eq. (b.4)

treating (h( k

one is to substitute

(b.9)

as it is clear from (b.9), the situation is somewhat distinct for the p = 1
and the p  2 terms of the expansion (b.7). in the p  2 case, the long-
wavelength term (b.9) does not contribute into the leading o(n 0) order
(of ln[t ()] ) we are interested in for eq. (b.3). according to (b.8), the
remaining short-wavelength p  2 terms are represented by the convergent
sums which results (see [14]) in

plementary, in the p = 1 case the short-wavelength contribution goes to
zero while the large n limit of the long-wavelength part merges with the

principle value of the integral p r d()

and employing the sp equations (4.27), one arrives at (5.11).
