abstract

calogero-moser models and toda models are well-known integrable multi-particle
dynamical systems based on root systems associated with lie algebras. the relation
between these two types of integrable models is investigated at the levels of the hamil-
tonians and the lax pairs. the lax pairs of calogero-moser models are specied by
t he representations of the reection groups, which are not the same as those of the
corresponding lie algebras. the latter specify the lax pairs of toda models. the
hamiltonians of the elliptic calogero-moser models tend to those of toda models as
one of the periods of the elliptic function goes to innity, provided the dynamical vari-
ables are properly shifted and the coupling constants are scaled. on the other hand
most of calogero-moser lax pairs, for example, the root type lax pairs, do not a have
consistent toda model limit. the minimal type lax pairs, which corresponds to the
minimal representations of the lie algebras, tend to the lax pairs of the corresponding
toda models.

1 introduction

this is the fth paper in a series devoted to the integrable dynamical systems of calogero-

moser type. in the rst three papers [1] (hereafter referred to as i, ii and iii), various lax

pairs were constructed and the symmetries of the systems were elucidated. in the fourth

paper [2] a universal lax pair operator applicable to the models based on non-crystallographic

as well as crystallographic root systems was constructed. when suitable representation

spaces are chosen, the universal lax pair reproduces all the lax pairs obtained so far and

many other representations give new lax pairs. in this paper we focus on the relations of

calogero-moser models and toda models.

calogero-moser models [3] and toda models [4, 5] are well-known integrable multi-particle

dynamical systems based on the crystallographic root systems, i.e. those associated with

lie algebras. though they are markedly dierent at rst sight, it has long been known

that for some particular root systems toda models can be obtained as a special limit of

the calogero-moser models [6]. the purpose of this paper is to clarify this limit for all the

calogero-moser models, now that we have a universal framework for the integrable structure

of these models. the limit problem can be considered at two levels, or maybe even three.

the rst is the limits of the dynamical variables and the hamiltonian. the second is those of

the lax pairs. since there are many lax pairs for one and the same calogero-moser model,

the result is expected to be varied. the third level would be the limits of the solutions of

the equations of motion and of the associated linear problem of the lax equations. we will

not address the problems at the third level in this paper.

while for the calogero-moser models the set of all roots is necessary, only the simple

roots enter the toda models. the potentials of toda models are exponential functions

of the dynamical variables q (the coordinates), with the mass scale parameters being the

only physically meaningful parameters at the classical level. the potentials of calogero-

moser models are more varied. besides the (independent) coupling constant(s) (for the long

and short roots in the non-simply laced theories), the generic elliptic potentials, i.e. the
weierstrass  functions have two primitive periods {21, 23} as adjustable parameters.
the other potentials, the trigonometric, hyperbolic and rational potentials are obtained as

degenerate cases of the elliptic ones. as we will show in section two, the hamiltonian of

an elliptic calogero-moser model based on the root system of lie algebra g tends to the

hamiltonian of a toda model based on g, its dual algebra g

, its ane counterpart g

(1)

or its dual (g

(1)). the detailed conditions for the limits will be stated there.

it should

be remarked that the signicance of the independent coupling constants in the non-simply

laced calogero-moser models is somehow lost in the limit. the limits of the lax pairs are

more intriguing.

as shown in a previous paper [2], the essential ingredient of calogero-moser lax pairs

is the representation of the reection groups, which are not identical with those of the

corresponding lie algebras. on the other hand the known lax pairs of toda models are

formulated in terms of the representation of the lie algebras. this poses an interesting

question whether some toda models lax pairs which do not belong to any representations

of the corresponding lie algebras could be obtained as limits of calogero-moser lax pairs,

for example, the root type ones. the answer turns out to be negative as we will show in

detail in section three. in fact most of calogero-moser lax pairs do not have a consistent

toda model limit. the minimal type lax pairs are shown to have consistent toda model

limits.

the rest of this paper is organised as follows. in section four we give an intuitive method

for constructing the lax pairs of toda models by explicit examples. this is inspired by the

limit of the minimal type lax pairs. section ve is devoted to summary and discussions. in

appendix a some denitions and useful formulas of the elliptic functions are given. appendix

b gives some explicit forms of the functions entering in calogero-moser lax pairs. these

functions are also considered in the limits to toda models. appendix c gives a new lax

pair for the bcr calogero-moser model, which is necessary in section three. the asymptotic

forms of various functions appearing in calogero-moser lax pairs are given in appendix d.

2 from the elliptic potentials to the exponential po-

tentials

let us start with the elliptic calogero-moser model, which is a hamiltonian system associated

with a root system  of rank r. we consider two types of root systems. the rst type is

those root systems associated with nite lie algebras. the second is the so-called bcr

system which is a union of the br roots and cr roots. the dynamical variables are the
coordinates {qj} and their canonically conjugate momenta {pj}, which will be denoted by
vectors in rr

q = (q1, . . . , qr),

p = (p1, . . . , pr).

(2.1)

the hamiltonian for the elliptic calogero-moser model is

h =

1
2

p2 +x

g2
||

||2 v||(  q),

(2.2)

in which the potential functions v|| and the real coupling constants g|| are dened on orbits

of the corresponding nite reection group, i.e. they are identical for roots in the same orbit.

that is g|| = g for all roots in simply laced models and g|| = gl for the long roots and

g|| = gs for the short roots in non-simply laced models. the potential functions v|| are:

1. untwisted elliptic potential . this applies to all of the root systems associated with lie

algebras and the potential function is

vl(  q) = vs(  q) = (  q|{21, 23}),

(2.3)

in which  is the weierstrass  function with a pair of primitive periods {21, 23}
(a.1). throughout this paper we adopt the convention that the weierstrass , , and

 functions have the above standard periods, unless otherwise stated.

2. twisted elliptic potential . this applies to all of the non-simply laced root systems.

except for the g2 model, the potential functions are

vl(  q) = (  q|{21, 23}),

vs(  q) = (  q|{1, 23}).

(2.4)

that is, the potential for the short roots has one half of the standard period in one

direction, which we choose to be 1. for the g2 model,

vl(  q) = (  q|{21, 23}),

vs(  q) = (  q|{

21
3

, 23}).

(2.5)

derivation of the twisted models from the untwisted ones by folding is given in paper

ii, [1].

3. untwisted and twisted potentials for the bcr system. the bcr root system consists
of the long, middle and short roots,  = l  m  s. the untwisted model has
the same potential for all the roots

vl(  q) = vm (  q) = vs(  q) = (  q|{21, 23}).

(2.6)

the twisted model has potentials with the full, a half and a fourth periods:

vl(  q) = (  q|{21, 23}),
vs(  q) = (  q|{1/2, 23}).

vm (  q) = (  q|{1, 23}),

(2.7)

4

there are three independent coupling constants gl, gm and gs in both cases.

in the discussion below the root systems associated with the lie algebras are assumed.

modication for the bcr case is straightforward.

on taking the limits to toda models it is convenient to adopt the following parametrisa-

tion of the periods:

1 = i, 3  r+,

 

3
1

= i3/.

(2.8)

then the above hamiltonian (2.2) is real for real dynamical variables p, q and coupling
constants g||. if we let 3  + for xed u the elliptic potentials tend to the hyperbolic
ones

,

vs(u) =

(2.9)

vl(u) =

sinh2 u

in order to obtain the exponential potential from the elliptic potentials we follow the

general prescription as explained in the appendix (a.6)(a.12), [6, 7]. first we shift the

dynamical variable q

q = q  23 v,

v  rr,

(2.10)

in which  is a positive parameter and v is an as yet unspecied vector in rr. let us require

that v has a non-vanishing scalar product with all the roots in 

  v 6= 0,

  .

(2.11)

suppose there are some roots which are orthogonal to v. they form a sub-root system of

. the potential functions for such roots will tend to the hyperbolic potentials (2.9) as
3  +, since their arguments  q =  q are xed. this justies the above requirement
(2.11). it should be remarked that the above shift (2.10) breaks the weyl invariance of the

calogero-moser models, by the introduction of the special vector v. on the other hand the

set of positive roots + and consequently the set of simple roots  can be dened in terms

of v:

+ = {  ,   v > 0},

 : set of simple roots.

(2.12)

because of the 23 periodicity and the even parity of the potentials, v||(u) = v||(u) we
can assume, without loss of generality, that

max
+

  v < 1.

5

(2.13)

in fact we require that  should satisfy a stronger condition

which implies that

and

 ((  v)min + (  v)max)  1,

 (  v)max  1   (  v)min

2 (  v)min  1.

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

by comparing the shift formula

  q =   q  23   v,

with the limit formula of the potentials (a.6)(a.12), we nd that for the following scalings

of the coupling constants

gl = ml e3|v|min,

gs =( ms e3|v|min/2,
ms e23|v|min/22,

untwisted potential,

twisted potential,

(2.17)

the elliptic potentials vanish for all   q except for those roots having the minimum (and
the maximum) value of the scalar product with the xed vector v, for which the exponential

potentials are obtained. that is we have

g2
lvl(  q) 

3+

m2
l eq
for such   + that   v is minimum,
l eq for such   + that   v is maximum,
m2
0

otherwise,

(2.18)




and the corresponding formula for g2
svs( q). it should be noted that for the twisted models
the minimum (maximum) of ( v) can be dierent for vl and vs, since only the long (short)
roots contribute to vl (vs). however, for the second possibility ( v is maximum) to occur,
the parameter  must be so chosen as to saturate the inequality in (2.14). as we will see

shortly, (2.22), (2.23), the saturation occurs only for the long root potentials.

in the formula (2.18) we considered only the positive roots . the number of non-

vanishing potential terms of the resulting theory is determined by those positive roots which
give the minimum (and the maximum) of   v. since all the positive roots are linear
combination of simple roots with non-negative integer coecients, the minimum can be

attained by the simple roots only and the maximum by the highest root. there are a

maximal number of potential terms when the minimum is attained by all the simple roots.

all the other cases can be considered as arising from calogero-moser models based on some

sub-root system of .

6

2.1 models based on the root systems of lie algebras

first let us discuss the models based on root systems associated with nite lie algebras. we
consider the case that the minimum of   v is attained by all the simple roots. we adopt
the convention that the long roots have squared length 2, 2
l = 2. it is well-known that the
weyl vector  and its dual  dened by

 =

1

2 x+

,

 =

1

2 x+

,

 = 2/2,

(2.19)

satisfy the above criterion. in fact we have

  i =

2
i
2

,

  i = 1,

i  ,

and

  h = h  1,

  h = h  1, h : highest root,

(2.20)

(2.21)

in which h and h are the coxeter number and the dual coxeter number, respectively. for
the choice v = , the minimum is always 1 for the long and short simple roots. for the

non-simply laced root system, there are two dierent values of minimum for v = , the weyl

vector, 1 for the long roots and 1/2 for the short roots. this corresponds to the existence

of two dierent coupling constants gl and gs. for all root systems  except a1, we have
|  |min < |  |max, with the long roots satisfying

|  |min + |  |max = h,

|  |min + |  |max = h

(2.22)

and the short roots

|  |min + |  |max < h,

|  |min + |  |max < h.

(2.23)

that is, the saturation of of the inequality (2.14) occurs only for the long roots for the choices
of  = 1/h for v =  or  = 1/h for v = . for a1 we have

 = ,

|  |min = |  |max = 1,

h = 2.

(2.24)

in the hamiltonian of an elliptic calogero-moser model based on a root system  which
is associated with a lie algebra g, we redene the dynamical variables from {p, q} to {p, q}

q = q  23 v,

p = p,

v =  or ,

(2.25)

and take the limit 3  + with 1 = i. the coupling constants are also scaled:

ms e23/22,
gs =( ms e3/2/2, untwisted potential,

gl = ml e3,

(2.26)

in this limit we arrive at the hamiltonian of the toda models associated with the lie algebra
(1)) depending on

, the untwisted ane lie algebra g

g, its dual algebra g

(1) or its dual (g

the types of the potential, untwisted or twisted, and the values of the parameter .

for the simply laced root system , we have the toda system associated with the lie

algebra g for  < 1/h:

h =

(2.27)

and the toda system associated with the untwisted ane lie algebra g

(1) for  = 1/h:

h =

p 2 + m2 xi

eiq + e0q! ,

(2.28)

in which 0 is the ane root 0 = h. for the a1 case with  = 1/2 the extreme situations
(2.24) and (a.12) apply and give the above result (2.28).

for a non-simply laced root system  and an untwisted potential, we have the toda

system associated with the lie algebra g:

h =

p 2 + m2

l  xil

eiq + e0q! + m2

s xis

eiq,

(2.30)

for v =  and  = 1/h or for v =  and  = 1/h. in these formulas l (s) is the set of

long (short) roots.

for a non-simply laced root system  and a twisted potential, we have the toda system

associated with the dual lie algebra g

:

h =

1

p 2 + m2

l xil

twisted ane lie algebra (g

(1)):

h =

l  xil

eiq + e0q! + m2

s xis

e2iq,

(2.32)

for v =  and  = 1/h or for v =  and  = 1/h. the formulas for the twisted potential

cases (2.31) and (2.32) are valid for all the non-simply laced models except for the one based
in this case the last term in (2.31) and (2.32) should be changed to e3iq with

on g2.

appropriate scaling of gs.

a few remarks are in order. in the calogero-moser models the meaning of the coupling

constant is clear. they specify the strength of the repulsive potentials near the boundary of

the weyl chambers. thus the independence of the coupling constants is quite crucial in the

calogero-moser model. these properties are lost in the transition to the toda models by

the shift of the dynamical variables (2.25) and the scalings of the coupling constants (2.26).

the remaining parameters ml and ms, (2.26), are generally considered as giving mass scales

of the toda theories. for the toda theories based on nite lie algebras, this interpretation

is not adequate, since these theories are conformally invariant. in fact, in the toda theories
based on nite lie algebras g, the mass parameters m2

i can be changed arbitrarily. suppose

we start from the hamiltonian

(2.33)

in which {i}, i = 1, . . . , r are the fundamental weights, satisfying i

(2.34)

the bcr root system consists of three parts, long, middle and short roots:

in which the roots are conveniently expressed in terms of an orthonormal basis of rr:

l = {2ej}, m = {ej  ek}, s = {ej} :

j = 1, . . . , r.

(2.35)

the set of simple roots is the same as that of br:

 = {er}  {ej  ej+1, j = 1, . . . , r  1}.

if we dene

h = 2r + 1,

gl = 2ml e3,

gm = mm e3,

gs = ms e3/2,

(2.36)

(2.37)

(2.38)

for the untwisted potential we obtain the non-ane br toda model for  < 1/h and a(2)

for the following scalings

(2.41)

this is due to the fact that the a(2)

2n root system is self-dual.

3 limits of the lax pairs

in this section we discuss the corresponding limits of the calogero-moser lax pairs. contrary

to the hamiltonian case which has well-dened limits to the toda model hamiltonians, the

limits of the lax pairs are diverse, some having well-dened limits to the toda model lax

pairs and some not. we consider two dierent types of calogero-moser lax pairs, the root

10

type and the minimal type [1], both expressing the canonical equations of motion in terms

of a pair of matrices l and m

l =

d
dt

l = [l, m].

(3.1)

roughly speaking the elements of the l matrix are square roots of the hamiltonian, since
tr(l2)  h. these lax pairs depend on an additional parameter , the spectral parameter,
which requires a shift proportional to 3 as we will see presently. therefore the existence of

a limit of the hamiltonian does not imply that of a lax pair, not to mention those of both

types, since they correspond to dierent types of square roots of the hamiltonian. in the

following we examine the limits of various lax pairs in turn.

3.1 minimal type lax pair for simply laced root systems

this type of lax pairs has the simplest structure and has a well-dened limit to the lax

pair of the corresponding toda model, as expected. this applies to the models based on the

root systems of ar, dr, e6 and e7.

the minimal type lax pairs have the following form,

l(q, p, ) = p  h + x,
m(q, ) = d + y.

(3.2)

the matrix elements of l and m are labelled by the weights of a minimal representation,

(i.4.1) in [1]. the matrices h and d are diagonal

h = 

and d = d, d = ig x=

(  q).

the matrices x and y have the form

x = igx

x(  q, )e(), y = igx

y(  q, )e(),

(3.3)

(3.4)

in which  is the spectral parameter and e() = ,. it should be stressed that the h

and e() here are not the lie algebra generators for the associated lie algebra g, though

they satisfy relations

[h, e()] = e(),
e() = e()t ,

[h, [e(), e()]] = ( + )[e(), e()],

[e(), e()] =   h.

(3.5)

11

the function x(u, ) ( y(u, ) = ux(u, )) is a solution of a certain functional equation

involving the potential function [8], (i.2.14), [1] and it factorises the potential as

x(u, )x(u, ) = (u) + ().
it is not unique in the sense that if x(u, ) is a solution then

(3.6)

x(u, ) = x(u, ) eb()u,

b() : an arbitrary function

(3.7)

is also a solution providing another factorisation, (ii.2.27), [1]. as shown in the previous

section, for

we have the following limits of the potential

q = q  23 ,

g = m e3,

(3.8)

(3.9)

g2(  q) 

3+

m2 eq

 < 1/h,
m2 ehq h : highest root,  = 1/h,

  ,

otherwise.




(in a simply laced root system  = .) in order to have a nite limit for g2(),  needs to

be shifted, too:

 = log z  23, z  r+,

 <   1/2,

(3.10)

in which the 3-independent part of  is parametrised by a positive number z for later
convenience. from (a.8) we then nd that g2()  e23(||) has a nite limit for 3  +
up to a diverging constant. this constant is canceled by the one coming from g2(  q) in
the factorisation formula (3.6). for the consistency of the limit of the lax pair with that of
the hamiltonian, the following limit of gx(  q, )

gx(  q, ) ( nite,

0,

for  i   (  1/h)
otherwise,

and  h

( = 1/h),

(3.11)

is necessary. it is obvious that this condition selects, if any, a unique solution among the

equivalent ones related by the symmetry transformation (3.7).

we will show that the following solution [9]

x(u, ) =

(  u)
()(u)

exp(()u)

(3.12)

satises the above condition (3.11) and gives a minimal type lax pair which tends to a
toda model lax pair in the limit 3  +. the asymptotic form of this solution can

12

be evaluated using formulas (a.13) and (a.15) 1. for () only (a.13) is needed and for
(  q) and (    q) both (a.13) and (a.15) are necessary according to the range of the
arguments.

for positive roots :

gx(  q, )  m exp( q
 mz exp( q

2 ) exp[3(1    )],
2 ) exp[3( +     2)],

0 <      < 1,

 1 <       0, (3.13)

whilst for negative roots :

gx(  q, )  m exp( q
z exp( q

  m

2 ) exp[3(1 +   )],
2 ) exp[3(2 +       2)]

0 <      < 1,
1       < 2.

(3.14)

for example, for the parameter ranges

(h  1) <   1/2,

or

 < 1/h,

 = 1/2,

(3.15)

the function gx(q, ) is non-vanishing only for the positive and negative simple roots. this
corresponds to the toda models based on simply laced nite lie algebras. for

 = 1/2,

 = 1/h

(3.16)

the function gx(  q, ) is non-vanishing only for the positive and negative simple roots and
the highest roots. this corresponds to the toda models based on simply laced ane lie

algebras.

in the other lax matrix m, (3.2), there are terms d and y . the limit of d simply
vanishes under the scaling because it contains the term g(  q), which has a power of g
less than that appearing in the potential, which has a nite limit. calculating the limit
for y is also not very dicult as we have already calculated the limit of gx(  q) and
gy(  q) = gx(  q). the result is summarised as follows (  is a positive root):

1 the formulas (3.13), (3.14), (3.17) and (3.18) are valid for all the root systems except for a1. the a1
case needs be considered separately because of (2.24). the toda lax pair (3.19), (3.20)is valid for all the
cases including the a1.

should be stressed again that although the matrices e() are not lie algebra generators as

a whole, they satisfy the necessary relations for the toda model lax pairs

[e(), e()] = 0, ,     {0},

(3.21)

on top of those listed in (3.5). the non-vanishing intermediate state  in the above com-
mutation relations either does not exist (for the case    = 1), or if it exists it forms a
pair which cancels with each other (for the case    = 0). this is due to the fact that the
weights of a minimal representation form a single weyl orbit. thus we nd that

l = [l, m]  q = p,

p = m2 x

exp(  q) + exp(0  q)0! .

(3.22)

3.2 root type lax pair for simply laced root systems

this type of lax pairs applies universally to all the calogero-moser models based on simply

laced root systems [1, 2]. its representation space is the set of roots  itself. thus it is not

related to any representation of the associated algebra g except for the simplest case of a1.

this type of lax pairs does not have a well-dened limit to the lax pair of the corresponding

14

toda model. thus the lax pair of a toda model which is not lie algebra valued cannot be

constructed in this way.

the root type lax pair for simply laced root systems reads:

l(q, p, ) = p  h + x + xd,
m(q, ) = d + y + yd.

(3.23)

all of the matrices are labelled by the roots, , ,   . the matrices h, d and x have a
similar structure to those in the minimal type lax pair, except that

e() = ,.

the matrices xd and yd are special for the root type lax pair:

xd = 2igx

xd(  q, )ed(), yd = igx

yd(  q, )ed(), ed() = ,2. (3.24)

the functions x(u, ) and xd(u, ) are solutions of coupled functional equations (ii.2.24),

(ii.2.25), [1]. they share similar properties. for example, similar to the factorisation of the

potential in terms of x(u, ) as in (3.6), we have another factorisation

xd(u, )xd(u, ) = (u) + (2).

(3.25)

thus, for the consistent limit of the lax pair, xd(u, ) should have the same type of asymp-

totic behaviour as that of x(u, ) (3.11):

gxd(  q, ) ( nite,

0,

for  i   and  h,
otherwise.

(3.26)

however, this is not the case, since it is not compatible with the following functional identity

(iii.3.21), [1]

x(2u, )xd(u, ) + x(2u, )xd(u, ) = (u) + (),

(3.27)

which is a simple consequence of the general functional equation (ii.2.25), [1]. we multiply
g2 to (3.27) and choose  to be a simple root

   = 1.
then the right hand side is nite as in (3.9). on the left hand side

u =   q =   q  23  ,

gx(2  q, )  0

15

since both have twice the damping factor. this means that either gxd(q, ) or gxd(q, )
or both must be divergent for simple roots . thus the desired asymptotic behaviour of

gxd(u, ) (3.26) is not achieved and the lax pair has no consistent limit. in appendix d we

list the asymptotic forms of xd and other functions.

3.3 other root type lax pairs without toda limits

the above argument for the non-existence of toda limits for calogero-moser lax pairs, based

as it is on the non-existence of nite x and xd functions for the simple roots, can be applied

to other models whose lax pairs contain the root type lax pair (x and xd functions). thus

the following lax pairs do not have a consistent toda limit:

1. root type lax pair based on long roots for untwisted and twisted br model.

2. root type lax pair based on short roots for untwisted and twisted cr. model

3. root type lax pair based on long and short roots for untwisted and twisted f4 model.

4. root type lax pair based on long and short roots for untwisted and twisted g2 model.

the set of the long roots of br is the same as the set of the roots of dr. thus the br

lax pairs based on the long roots for the untwisted and the twisted models (see section 4 of

paper iii, [1]) contain the functions x and xd.

the set of short roots of cr is the same as the set of roots of dr. thus the cr lax pairs

based on the short roots for the untwisted model (see section 4 of paper iii, [1]) contain

the functions x and xd. the cr lax pair based on the short roots for the twisted model
contains the twisted functions x(1/2) and x(1/2)

. for these functions the twisted analogue of

d

the identity (3.27) reads

x(1/2)(2u, )x(1/2)

d

(u, ) + x(1/2)(2u, )x(1/2)

d

(u, ) = (u|{1, 23}) + f ().

(3.28)

this can be obtained from (iii.5.10), [1] and f () is a  dependent constant of integration.
thus we know that x(1/2)(  q, ) and x(1/2)
(  q, ) for  simple roots cannot be nite at
the same time by the argument given in the previous section. it should be stressed that this
conclusion does not depend on a particular choice of solutions x(1/2) and x(1/2)

, e.g. (iii.5.15),

d

[1], since (3.28) is a consequence of the functional equations. in fact, it also applies to a
dierent set of solutions x(1/2) and x(1/2)

given in appendix b which are equivalent to those

d

used in [7] for the lax pair of the f4 model based on short roots.

16

d

since the algebra f4 is self-dual, f 

4 = f4, the sets of long roots and of short roots have
the same structure as the set of roots for d4. thus the f4 lax pair based on the long roots

for the untwisted and twisted models (see section 4 of paper iii, [1]) contains the functions

x and xd. the f4 lax pair based on the short roots for the untwisted model contains the
functions x and xd and the twisted models the twisted functions x(1/2) and x(1/2)

.

d

the algebra g2 is also self-dual, g

2 = g2. the sets of long roots and of short roots have
the same structure as the set of a2 roots. the same argument as that for f4 applies to this

case, although the twisting is threefold.

3.4 minimal type lax pair for non-simply laced root systems

this applies to the untwisted and twisted br models based on the spinor representation

and the untwisted and twisted cr models based on the vector representation. these can

be handled in a unied way. the toda limits of the lax pairs exist only for the untwisted
models and for both choices v = , .

first let us consider the untwisted potential case. the lax pair contains one function x

only. the choice v =  is suitable for the toda limit because in this case the minimum of
  (= 1/2) is achieved by the short simple roots and the long simple roots have    = 1.
therefore the dierent scalings, as explained in (2.26), for gl and gs would produce a
consistent toda lax pair. that is gl = mle3 and gs = mse3/2/2 with  < 1/h
(= 1/h) for non-ane (ane) theories.

for the choice v = ,  < 1/h (= 1/h), gl = ml e3, gs = ms e3/2, the minimum
of    is achieved by all the simple roots. thus the minimal type lax pair has a nite
limit and gives non-ane br ( cr) or ane b(1)
r ) toda models for the same parameter
r
range as in the minimal type lax pairs for the simply laced root systems.

(c (1)

the lax pair for the twisted potentials contains two functions, x and x(1/2). these

functions satisfy the relations (iii.5.23), [1]

x(u, )x(1/2)(u, ) + x(u, )x(1/2)(u, ) = 2(u) + g(),

(3.29)

in which g() is a -dependent constant of integration. based on this formula one can show
that the toda model limit does not exist for either choice of v =  or  as in the root type

lax pair cases.

17

3.5 root type lax pair for non-simply laced root systems

in this subsection the root type lax pair for non-simply laced root systems which are not

treated in subsection 3.3 will be discussed. these are the untwisted and twisted br models

based on the short roots and the untwisted and twisted cr models based on the long roots.

as has been pointed out in paper ii, [1], the root type lax pair for the cr model based on

the long roots is equivalent to the minimal type lax pair. we will therefore discuss toda

model limits of the br model lax pair based on the short roots.

first let us consider the untwisted br model.

in this case the lax pair contains the
function x for the long roots and xd for the short roots. for the choice v = , the long

roots and short roots are treated equally. thus the same argument based on (3.27) applies

and the lax pair has no consistent toda model limit. for the choice v = , the simple short
roots have half the decreasing factor of the simple long roots. this requires gl = ml e3,
gs = ms e3/2/22 for the nite potentials. by multiplying glgs to (3.27), we obtain

glx(2u, )gsxd(u, ) + glx(2u, )gsxd(u, ) = glgs((u)  ()).

suppose that glx(  q) and gsxd(  q) are both nite for the simple roots. let us choose
u =   q with  being a simple short root. the left hand side is then nite, but the right
hand side is divergent since g2
s( q) is nite by assumption and the right hand side has an
extra divergent factor gl/gs  e3/2. thus the lax pair for the br untwisted model based
on the short roots has no consistent toda model limit.

next we consider the twisted model. in this case the lax pair contains the function x
for the long roots and x(1/2)
(  q, )
are non-vanishing for the simple roots with the scalings gl = ml e3, gs = ms e3/22.
we have a relation (iii.5.22), [1]

for the short roots. for v = , glx(  q, ) and gsx(1/2)

d

x(2u, )x(1/2)

d

(u, ) + x(2u, )x(1/2)

d

(u, ) = (u|{1, 23}) + ()  (1),

(3.30)

which is consistent with the limit of the hamiltonian. the result is summarised as follows (

the resulting lax pair is that of the cr = (br) toda model for the parameter range

(h  1) <   1/2,

or

 < 1/h,

 = 1/2,

and the lax pair of the toda model based on the twisted ane algebra a(2)

2r1 = (b(1)

r ) for

 = 1/2,

 = 1/h.

the niteness of the potential for long and short simple roots when v =  requires
dierent scalings of gl and gs, namely gl = ml e3, gs = ms e23/22, (2.26). for
 < 1/h (= 1/h) we obtain a nite non-ane (ane) toda lax pair.

3.6 root type lax pairs for the bcr model based on the long

and/or short roots

the set of the middle roots of the bcr root system is the same as the set of roots of dr.

consequently the root type lax pair for the bcr model based on its middle roots does not

have a consistent toda model limit. this leads us to consider the root type lax pair based

on the long or the short roots. since the bcr root system is self-dual, the lax pair based on

the long roots and that based on the short roots are related by the duality transformation.

thus we consider only the root type lax pair based on the short roots. our interest lies

in the case in which the potentials for the long, middle and short roots survive in the toda

limit. the other situations are the same as in the br or cr cases.

first let us consider the untwisted potentials.

in this case the lax pair contains two

functions, x for the long and the middle roots and xd for the short roots. for the choice
of v =  given in (2.37),    = 1 for the simple middle and the simple short roots. as
shown in the root type lax pair for the non-simply laced case, gm x( q, ) and gsxd( q, )
cannot be simultaneously nite for the simple roots. here the scalings of the couplings are

19

determined by the hamiltonian (2.38). thus the lax pair does not have a toda model limit

for untwisted potentials.

next we consider the most general twisted model, the extended bcr model with ve

independent coupling constants, (iii.4.87), [1], [10]. we give the lax pair for this model in
appendix c. it is easy to see that the extended function x(1/2)
for the short roots cannot be
nite at the same time as x(1/2) for the middle roots. similarly, another extended function
x(1/2) for the long roots cannot be nite at the same time as x(1/2) for the middle roots.

d

thus for the consistent toda model limit we have to put gs1 = gl2 = 0 and we are led to
the ordinary twisted model with gl1  gl, gm and gs2  gs should be scaled as in (2.40),
which is determined by the limit of the hamiltonian. now we have three functions x for the
long roots, x(1/2) for the middle roots and x(1/4)
for the short roots in the lax pair. the
coexistence of the function x and x(1/2) cannot have a nite limit as discussed in subsection
3.4, see (3.29). we thus come to the conclusion that the a(2)

2r toda lax pair cannot be

d

obtained as a limit from the lax pair of the bcr calogero-moser lax pair.

let us close this section with a remark on the toda model limits of the lax pairs of

calogero-moser model in the generic representations of the reection groups (see section

ve of [2]). it is rather straightforward to see that the consistent toda model limit does not
exist in general. the lax pair contains the function x(  q,  ), in which  is a generic
basis vector of the representation. this means that there are as many dierent functions of
  q as there are dierent values of   corresponding to one potential function (  q).
it is in general not possible that all of them have the same toda model limit.

4 lax pairs of toda models

in this section we give a general intuitive method of constructing lax pairs for toda models.

this method works for systems associated with a, b, c and d series. the method works

for those root systems for which the simple roots and the ane root can be written in the
form 2ei, ei  ej or ei, where {ei} forms an orthonormal basis. a hint for this method
actually comes from the limits of the minimal type calogero-moser lax pairs described in

the preceding section. we explain the method with simple examples.

20

4.1 c (1)
2

first we discuss the case where the roots are of the form 2ei and ei  ej (the case of the
form ei will be discussed later in the section). let us consider the ane c (1)
2 toda model.
the hamiltonian is given by

h(1)
c2 =

1
2

(p2

1 + p2

2) + m2eq1q2 +

the canonical equations of motion are

m2

2 (cid:0)e2q2 + e2q1(cid:1) .

p1 = 

p2 = 

h
q1
h
q2

= m2eq1q2 + m2e2q1,
= m2eq1q2  m2e2q2,

(4.1)

(4.2)

with q1 = p1 and q2 = p2. in this case the two simple roots are 2e2 and e1  e2. the ane
root is given by 2e1. the l matrix is constructed in the following way. the dimension
dim of the lax pair would be twice the rank of the algebra (this is not always the case, as

we remark afterwards). the diagonal part of l is given by,

li,i = l2r+1i,2r+1i = pi,

i = 1, 2, .., r; r : rank.

(4.3)

now corresponding to every simple or ane root we have o-diagonal elements in l. suppose
we have a simple root of the form ei  ej. corresponding to this we have ,

li,j = lj,i = l2r+1j,2r+1i = l2r+1i,2r+1j = im exp

1
2

(qi  qj),

i 6= j.

(4.4)

for the present example c2, 2r = 4 and there is a simple root e1  e2 and correspondingly
we have

l1,2 = l2,1 = l3,4 = l4,3 = im exp

(q1  q2).

(4.5)

1
2

another type of root is of the form 2ei. corresponding to these we have counter diagonal
elements in l as follows:

li,2r+1i = l2r+1i,i = im exp(qi).

(4.6)

in the c2 case corresponding to the ane root 2e1 and a simple root 2e2 then one has,

l1,4 = l4,1 = im exp(q1) and l2,3 = l3,2 = im exp(q2),

(4.7)

21

respectively. the rest of the matrix elements of l vanishes. this completes the construction
of l for ane c (1)

2 toda model. once l is constructed m can be written down very easily

in the following way. in m the diagonal elements are vanishing,

mi,i = m2r+1i,2r+1i = 0,

and the o-diagonal elements are determined by those of l:

mi,j =

i
2|li,j|,

i 6= j.

the matrices l and m for the ane c (1)

is e1  e2. we adopt the following hamiltonian:

(4.14)

for simple roots of the form (qi + qj) one writes elements in l as

li,2r+1j = l2r+1j,i = lj,2r+1i = l2r+1i,j = im exp[

1
2

(qi + qj)].

(4.15)

so in this case corresponding to the ane root we have (the other terms are the same as

those in the c2 case),

l1,3 = l3,1 = l2,4 = l4,2 = im exp

1
2

(q1  q2),

(4.16)

in these two examples l is hermitian and m anti-hermitian. of course both of the lax pairs

constructed here are well-known.

4.3 d(2)

3 and b(1)

2

the third and fourth examples are the duals of those given in the previous two subsections.
the dimensions of the lax pairs for b(1)
2

are 5 and 6, respectively. these cases

and d(2)
3

involve some of the simple roots of the form ei. first we construct the lax pair for the
b(1)
b(1)
2

2 toda model. we could have written down the simple roots and the ane root of ane
3 ,. in this case
normalisation for the long roots is 2 whereas in the earlier parametrisation it is 4. for each

as e1  e2, e2 and e1  e2, respectively, by taking the co-roots of d(2)

simple root of the form ei one has to add an additional row and column to the lax pair

given above which is initially 2r dimensional i.e. twice the rank. since in the b2 case there

is only one simple root e2 of this form the dimension of the lax pair is 5. we mark the new

23

row and column by 0, and we put the corresponding row and column in the middle of the
lax pair matrices. the diagonal element l0,0 = 0. corresponding to ei we insert elements

li,0 = l0,i = l0,2r+1i = l2r+1i,0 = im exp(

1

qi).

for the b2 toda model we then have

l2,0 = l0,2 = l0,3 = l3,0 = im exp(

q2).

(4.20)

(4.21)

the rest of the elements of l and m are constructed in the usual manner as explained above

5 summary and discussions

as shown in section 2, the hamiltonians of the elliptic calogero-moser models tend to those

of toda models as one of the periods of the elliptic function goes to innity, provided the

dynamical variables are properly shifted and the coupling constants are scaled. although

both calogero-moser and toda models are integrable, the corresponding limits of the lax

pairs are subtle. this is partly because of the abundance of lax pairs, i.e. there are many

lax pairs for a given calogero-moser model. here we list those lax pairs of calogero-moser

models which have toda model limits.

here we give an intuitive explanation why some calogero-moser lax pairs, for example,

the root type lax pairs for simply laced root systems, do not have toda limits. in some lax

pairs, there are two dierent functions, e.g. x and xd, corresponding to the same potential in

the hamiltonian. these functions are related to the potentials by the factorisation formulas,

25

for example (3.6), (3.25), and the limits of the potentials are unique. that is, these two
dierent functions must have the same limit for all the possible arguments  q belonging to
the potential. this is not compatible with the functional equations they must satisfy, thus

the postulated limits to toda models do not exist in such cases.

in [7] it is claimed that the lax pair for the twisted f4 model based on the short roots

has a toda model limit. in subsection 3.3 we have shown that such a limit does not exist.
let us follow their logic here. they use three functions x, x(1/2) and x(1/2)
and their solution for x(1/2) and x(1/2)
corresponds to (b.1) and (b.2) given in appendix b.
they show that gsx(1/2)
(  q, ) has a non-vanishing nite limit for  simple short roots
and at the same time it is claimed that gsx(1/2)(  q, ) vanishes for positive short roots.
this would clearly violate the factorisation relation (the half period analogue of (3.6)) unless
gsx(1/2)(  q, ) diverge for positive short roots. as a result, the lax pair does not have a
toda model limit.

in our notation,

d

d

d

let us assume, according to their claim, that gsx(1/2)(  q, ) vanishes for short roots.
this would lead to another contradiction with the formula tr(l2)  h, without invoking
the factorisation formulas. on the right hand side the limit of the potential is well dened

and unique, whereas on the left hand side the short root potential has two dierent sources,
one from the function x(1/2)
and the other from x(1/2). the former has a nite limit while
the latter contribution vanishes. this means that the relation tr(l2)  h is broken in the
limiting process.

d

in [7] a toda model lax pair for the twisted ane lie algebra d(2)

r+1 is obtained as a limit
of a lax pair for the twisted cr calogero-moser model in a 2r + 2 dimension representation

[11], which does not belong to the minimal type or root type lax pairs developed in our

series of papers [1].

appendix

a elliptic functions

here we collect some mathematical formulas which will be used in the main text. for the

elliptic functions we follow the notation and conventions of [12] throughout this paper. the

weierstrass function  is a doubly periodic meromorphic function with a pair of primitive
periods {21, 23}, (3/1) > 0:

(u)  (u|{21, 23}) =

1

u2 +xm, n

(a.1)

in which m, n is a period

m, n = 2m1 + 2n3

and p  denotes the summation over all integers, positive, negative and zero, excluding

m = n = 0. the weierstrass sigma function (u) is dened from (u) via the weierstrass

zeta function (u) as:

(u) = d log (u)/du = (u)/(u),

(u) =  (u),
+xm, n
(u)  (u|{21, 23}) =
(u)  (u|{21, 23}) = u ym, n

the exponential potentials can be obtained from the elliptic potentials simply by the follow-

ing way. for a shifted argument

u = u  3,

|| < 1,

the summations in (a.3) and (a.4) can be neglected in the limit 3  + to obtain

(a.6)

(a.7)

(a.8)

in other words we obtain the following asymptotic formulas:

vl(u)  eu 3 + const,

vs(u)  4e2u 23 + const,

 >< 0.

(a.9)

thus by appropriate scalings of the coupling constants

gl = ml e3||/2,

gs = ms e3||/2,

||  1,

(a.10)

the exponential potentials can be obtained:

g2
lvl(u)  m2

l eu ,

g2
svs(u)  m2

s e2u ,

 >< 0,

|| < 1,

(a.11)

in which we understand the constant parts are properly subtracted. the extreme case || = 1
deserves special attention

g2
lvl(u  3)  m2

l(cid:0)eu + eu(cid:1) ,

g2
svs(u  3)  4m2

s(cid:0)e2u + e2u(cid:1) .

(a.12)

it should be remarked that any shift of the argument u of the potentials which is proportional
to 3 can always be written in the form (a.6) with ||  1, due to the 23 periodicity of the
 function. thus the shifted potential functions always decrease exponentially e3||, up to

an additive constant term. only those potential terms which have the minimal decrease can

be made nite by appropriate scalings of the coupling constants.

the corresponding approximation formula for the  function reads

(u)  2 sinh

u
2

exp(

u2
24

),

28

(a.13)

in which u is shifted as in (a.6). since (u) is quasi-periodic in u, we need two additional

asymptotic formulas corresponding to plus (minus) one period shift. for

we have

u = u0  23,

u0 = u  3,

|| < 1,

(u)  2 sinh

b other solutions of the functional equations

here we present without proof some new sets of solutions to the functional equations for the
twisted functions {x(1/2), x(1/2)
}.
these solutions are closely related to the ones given in the appendix of [2] and the derivation
is similar. for {x(1/2), x(1/2)

} and similar functions for the g2 model, {x(1/3), x(1/3)

} we have

c extended twisted bcr root system lax pair with

ve independent couplings based on short roots

here we write the root type lax pair for the twisted bcr system based on the short roots.

the pattern of short root short root is:

bcr :

short root  short root =


long root
middle root
2  short root
non-root

based on this one can construct the lax pair as

l(q, p, ) = p  h + xm + xd + xl,
m(q, ) = dm + dl + ds + ym + yd + yl,

(c.1)

(c.2)

in which xm (ym) corresponds to short root  short root= middle root, xl (yl) corresponds
to short root  short root= long root and xd (yd) corresponds to short root  short root=
2 short root:
