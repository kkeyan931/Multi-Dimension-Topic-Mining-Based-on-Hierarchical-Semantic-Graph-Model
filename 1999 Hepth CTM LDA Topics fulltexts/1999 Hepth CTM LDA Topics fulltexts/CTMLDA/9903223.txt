(2.3) 2 variations c, n w induce gauge transformations (2.3) connection (2.2) depend functional parameters may also involve variations change all. note number new variables exceeds old variables exactly 2. consider special subset ve-parametric transformations form n = n , c = g1n , w = w . (2.4) = g1() and, therefore, transformations (2.4) induce gauge transformations (2.3). condition n w = 0 invariant transformations (2.4). hence, gauge transformed congurations form (2.2). impose two additional conditions w covariant trans- formations (2.4), transformations (2.4) uniquely identied gauge transformations new variables. propose following conditions ()w = w + gcn w + n(n w) = 0 .

(2.2) (2.5) determine complete parameterization generic su(2) connection. parameterization several remarkable properties going discuss. consider isovector b = b(n) constructed eld n derivatives b n = 0. since n n = 0, isovector always taken linear combinations b = bn coecients b functions n derivatives. let us construct complex scalar eld = b w + (b w) . (3.1) consider gauge transformations leave eld n unchanged. rotations n, i.e., = n (2.4). get c = g1 = i. is, eld c 3 maxwell eld respect gauge subgroup u(1) stationary group n, scalar eld plays role charged eld. reasons would like describe su(2) yang-mills theory eective qed, set elds c, n enough carry physical degrees freedom original su(2) theory. understood follows. eld w six independent components parameterization su(2) connection. using isotopic rotations may impose two gauge conditions w break su(2) u(1). among remaining four components w always select two (real) components identied complex scalar eld suitable choice b. two components uniquely xed gauss law s/a0 = 0. recall su(2) gauge theory three lagrange multipliers a0. impose gauge condition dynamical variables ai (i = 1, 2, 3) aim get dynamical description terms physical degrees freedom, lagrange multipliers must obtained solving gauss law a0 gauge (or parameterization) chosen ai. gauss law imposes restriction possible parameterizations connections via physical variables. since u(1) left unbroken gauge group theory, two equations gauss law solved lagrange multiplier c0 associated u(1) symmetry get xed. thus, eective abelian gauge theory, dynamically equivalent non-abelian su(2) theory, eld w carries two physical degrees freedom associated complex scalar eld (3.1). eective dynamics n (an eective eld theory polyakovs strings) discussed and, therefore, explicit parameterization w via physical variables relevant. parameterization important formulate duality properties yang-mills theory . physical meaning eld n eective abelian gauge theory described above? answer question let us make abelian projection (in hoofts terminology ) yang-mills theory imposing gauge eld n rather w. suitable gauge rotation isovector n always direct along, say, third coordinate axis isospace, i.e., n = n0 = (0, 0, 1). case eld w would four physical degrees freedom (in sense hamiltonian formalism described above). moreover, since conditions (2.5) covariant gauge transformations, gauge transformed elds c, w n also satisfy them. setting n equal n0 (2.5), latter turns condition well known lattice yang-mills theories maximal abelian gauge . reason maximal abelian gauge special lattice yang-mills theory following. suppose congurations aq , q = 1, 2, ..., q, elements wilson ensemble, i.e., generated means monte-carlo method boltzmann probability exp. expectation value quantity f (a) hf = q1 pq f (aq). example, one take f = wc wilson loop. hwci one nds string tension su(2) coecient linearly rising part potential heavy quark antiquark. every conguration aq one nd gauge transformation u = u(aq) gauge transformed conguration form uaq satisfy condition (2.5) uwq uc q = n0 uc q + uwq 4 uc q uaq use calculate hwci again. uc q n = n0. is, every conguration wilson ensemble gauge transformed satisfy maximal abelian gauge. one takes abelian parts n0 abelian congurations (the action quadratic c), one would expect perimeter law corresponding coulomb interaction static sources rather area law, i.e., one would expect corresponding string tension u(1) vanish. surprising numerical result procedure gives area law again, u(1) nearly full string tension su(2) (to exact, 92 per cent su(2)). phenomenon called abelian dominance . might look rather mysterious especially view wc(a) gauge invariant quantity. paradox disappears one observes gauge transformations u(aq) used implement maximal abelian gauge regular spacetime (e.g., u u 6= 0). strictly speaking, gauge transformations tensor quantities, like, e.g., eld strength, longer transformed homogeneously. reason abelian vector potential uc q singularities (or defects) quantum numbers dirac magnetic monopoles respect unbroken u(1) gauge group. therefore maxwell vector potential uc q describes dynamics photons also dirac magnetic monopoles physical degrees freedom wilson ensemble maximal abelian gauge. 2 = n0 uaq thus, singular transformations u(aq) transfer relevant physical degrees freedom non-abelian components (perpendicular n0) connection abelian ones (parallel n0). degrees freedom identied dirac magnetic monopoles. locations monopoles found studying magnetic ux carried uc q surfaces around dual lattice cite . since regular (photon) congurations uc q cannot provide area law wilson loop, monopole part uc q one removes photon part uc q calculate hwci using monopole part uc q , corresponding string tension diers u(1) 5 per cent, i.e., u(1) su(2). known monopole dominance . must expected give major contribution u(1) su(2). conclusion one obviously arrives nonperturbative yang-mills dy- namics favors congurations look like dirac magnetic monopoles maximal abelian gauge. interpretation degrees freedom dirac monopoles gauge dependent, fact existence certainly gauge independent. con- gurations capture relevant degrees freedom yang-mills theory connement phase. nontrivial dynamical statement discovered lattice gauge theories. note explicit form aq determined full yang-mills action, means obvious dynamics must congurations saturate area law look like dirac magnetic monopoles particular gauge. algebraic gauge n = n0. therefore expect connections aq parameterization su(2) connection maximal abelian gauge simple gauge 2in fact, case abelian projection , every abelian projection abelian (or monopole) dominance holds . 5 transformation transforms n(aq) special form n0 regular, gauge transformed abelian potential uc q singularities quantum numbers dirac monopoles respect residual gauge group u(1) (rotations n0). condition (2.5) covariant gauge transformations (2.4) turns maximal abelian gauge gauge transform n n0, c uc q w uwq ), u(aq) su(2)/u(1) dened uaq satises maximal abelian gauge, conclude eld n form n0(n0 uaq = uaq = n0 uaq n(aq) = 1 2 tr h u (aq)3u(aq)i .

(4.1) eld w satisfy condition (2.5), leads desired equations n = n(a): (a, n) (a)(a, n) = 0 . (4.2) easy verify n 0. isovector always perpendicular n and, hence, eq.

(4.4) (4.5) integral yang-mills elds (4.5) could done analytically either perturbation theory means instantons. latter case functional integral replaced ordinary integral instanton moduli space, replaced instanton conguration. develop perturbation theory, one write functional integral ghost elds. denition (4.3) follows = det(/n). introducing set complex ghost elds n = 0, (a, n) = z dd expnsgh(, , a, n)o , (4.6) sgh = z d4x (a)  . (4.7) delta function (4.5) written exponential form via fourier transform. ghosts introduced nothing gauge xing. pointed before, gauge xing condition assumed (2.1) appropriate modication measure da. note integral (4.5) invariant simultaneous gauge transformations n (cf. (2.3) (2.4)). ghost representation (4.6), (4.7) used, ghost eld transformed = . imposing gauge a, gauge freedom removed. therefore gauge chosen make computation integral (4.5) convenient (e.g., lorentz gauge perturbation theory, background gauge instanton technique used). accordingly, also conventional set ghost elds associated gauge chosen. convenient make shift integration variables + g1n n extract tree level contribution eective action (the second term (1.1)). eective action (4.5) supports knot solitons collective excitations, gradient expansion (4.5) exist mass scale m2 6= 0 determined equation = m2ab2 (x y) .

(4.9) suggests also inverse monte-carlo method applied ensemble a(n) directly. one takes ensemble monopole connections n0c maximal abelian projection (i.e., projection o-diagonal components connections well photon part diagonal components set zero), ensemble a(n) obtained gauge transformations u (a) n0c construction (3.3) ua(n) = n0c . u(a) gauge group elements used implement maximal abelian gauge wilson ensemble. 5 generalization su(n) gauge group realistic theory gauge group su(3). monopole dominance also established su(3) lattice gauge theory maximal abelian projection (see, e.g.,  references therein). construct parameterization su(n) connection monopole degrees freedom maximal abelian projection described coset eld su(n)/n 1. parameterization similar, same, parameterization proposed recently faddeev niemi , also diers parameterization periwal {$9808127$}. develop eective action coset eld, follow method discussed su(2) case, meaning explicit elimination nonphysical degrees freedom made, thereby hard problem (unsolved ) solving gauss law avoided. shall point interesting relation emerging large n limit monopole dominance. let hi, = 1, 2, ..., n 1, basis cartan subalgebra algebra su(n). assume basis orthonormal respect killing form (hi, hk) = ik. recall two elements lie algebra killing form dened (y, z) = tr(yz), yz =   lie product lie algebra. matrix representation (y, z) = c tr(yz), c depends lie algebra  (c = 2n su(n)). consider orthonormal cartan-weyl basis  every lie algebra element decomposed khk . (5.1) = x>0(cid:16)c c + s(cid:17) + xk ranges positive roots algebra, coecients c,s , k real. follows need commutation relations  = i(h, )s  = 9 i(h, )c (for element h cartan subalgebra). commutation relations basis elements omitted. found in, e.g., textbook . let u(x) su(n)/n 1 nk = u hku. since killing form invariant adjoint action group, conclude (ni, nk) = ik. set (cf. ) = ig1n + nkc k + w + w , (5.2) (nk, w) = 0 w also satises following n 2 n conditions ()w w + igc k  n , w] = 0 . (5.3) connection 4(n 2 1) independent components represented n 2 n independent functions nk, 4(n 1) functions c k 4(n 2 1) (n 2 n) 4(n 1) functions w. gauge transformation law new variables reads nk = i , w = i , c k = g1(nk, ) . (5.4) prove this, show transformations (5.4) induce innitesimal gauge transformation a: = g1(a). comparing gauge transformations left- right-hand sides eq. (5.2), nd relation = n  + nk(nk, ) (5.5)  = (hk, )2su and, similarly,  = i(hk, ) = (hk, )2cu ,  = 0. relation (5.5) follows resolution unity local cartan-weyl basis, provided pk(hk, )2 = 1/n every root . hk form pk(hk, )2 = (, ) = tr 2 = 1/n. latter means roots su(n) norm, easily established dynkin diagram su(n). compute norm, set (, ) = b root calculate matrix elements applying basis elements cartan-weyl basis, relation (, ) = tr 2 root pattern follows b = 1/n. thus, relation (5.5) true identity. similar fashion, one prove (nk, ()w) = (nk, w) 0. idea compute abelian components last term (5.3) local cartan-weyl basis. abelian components produced c scomponents w  correspond root   = i, (h, ) = (h, ) = (h, ) = 0 6= element h cartan subalgebra. thus, eq.
