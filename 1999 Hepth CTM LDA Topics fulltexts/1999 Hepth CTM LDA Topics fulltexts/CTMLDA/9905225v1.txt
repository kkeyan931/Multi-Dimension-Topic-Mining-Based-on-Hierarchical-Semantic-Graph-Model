(received january 20, 2014)

we present a regularization scheme which respects the supersymmetry and the maximal
background gauge covariance in supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. when the anomaly
cancellation condition is satised, the eective action in the supereld background eld
method automatically restores the gauge invariance without counterterms. the scheme also
provides a background gauge covariant denition of composite operators that is especially
useful in analyzing anomalies. we present several applications: the minimal consistent
gauge anomaly; the super-chiral anomaly and the superconformal anomaly; as the corre-
sponding anomalous commutators, the konishi anomaly and an anomalous supersymmetric
transformation law of the supercurrent (the central extension of n = 1 supersymmetry
algebra) and of the r-current.

introduction

behind the recent non-perturbative analyses of the supersymmetric gauge the-
ories, the existence of an invariant regularization that respects the supersymmetry
and the gauge symmetry always seems to be assumed. such a regularization should
be vital also in practical calculations because it avoids the introduction of countert-
erms necessary to recover ward-takahashi identities. therefore, it seems yet to be
important to seek for such an invariant regularization in supersymmetric gauge the-
ories. 1)
if one knows how to restore the preferred symmetries by counterterms, of
course, any regularization may be employed. however, it is also true that with a non-
invariant regularization a naive analysis easily leads to wrong physical predictions
in view of the preferred symmetries. for example, one might miss the fermion num-
ber non-conservation in chiral gauge theories, 2) with use of the gauge non-invariant
pauli-villars regularization. an invariant regularization allows one to obtain correct
predictions in the naive way.

in this talk, i like to introduce the recent attempt of our group 3) - 5) for obtaining
an invariant regularization scheme in supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. our
scheme is perturbative in nature but it possesses the following properties. the
supersymmetry is manifest; the scheme is based on the supereld formalism in an
exactly four-dimensional spacetime. the eective action in the supereld background
eld method above one-loop order is always background gauge invariant. being
consistent with the existence of the gauge anomaly, the one-loop eective action is not
background gauge invariant in general. however the breaking is kept to be minimal;

the consistent gauge anomaly is proportional to the anomaly dabc = tr t a{t b, t c}.
as the result, when the anomaly cancellation condition dabc = 0 is satised, the
eective action restores the background gauge invariance without any counterterms.
the scheme also provides a background gauge covariant supersymmetric denition of
composite operators, that is especially useful in analyzing anomalies. unfortunately
the quantum gauge (or brs) symmetry is not manifest in our scheme and one has
to verify the slavnov-taylor identity order by order (this is possible at least in the
one-loop level 4)). we note that however even with respect to the background gauge
symmetry it is not trivial to obtain such an invariant scheme, due to the gauge
anomaly in chiral gauge theories.

our convention is basically that of ref. 6); our particular convention will be
noted when necessary. for simplicity of presentation, we assume the gauge rep-
resentation r of the chiral multiplet, which will be denoted as t a, is irreducible.
the normalization of the gauge generator is [t a, t b] = itabct c, tr t at b = t (r)ab,
(t a)ij(t a)jk = c(r)ik and tacdtbcd = c2(g)ab.

to apply the notion of the supereld background eld method, 7) we split the gauge
supereld and the chiral supereld as 3)

ev = evb evq,

 = b + q.

(2.2)

here, the subscripts b and q represent the background eld and the quantum eld,
respectively. we shall regard vb as a vector supereld, and thus vq is not a vector
supereld: v 
q = evb vqevb . with the splitting (2.2), the original gauge transfor-
mation 6)

ev ei,

 = ei,

(2.3)

ev 

= ei

where  = t aa is a chiral supereld d  = 0, is realized in the following two
dierent ways. (i) by the quantum gauge transformation:

v 
b = vb,

ev 

q = (evb ei

evb )evq ei,

 = ei.

(2.4)

(ii) by the background gauge transformation:

ev 

b = ei

evb ei,

q = eivqei,
v 

 = ei.

next, we introduce the background covariant derivative symbol:

since the gauge parameter  in eq. (2.5) is chiral, these derivatives transform as
 = eiei under the background eld transformation (2.5). on the gauge
representation r, the covariant derivative is dened by

d = ,

dm = m.

(2.7)

on the other hand, the quantum eld vq transforms as the adjoint representation
under the background transformation and the covariant derivative for the adjoint
representation is dened as

dv = [, v },

dmv = [m, v ],

(2.8)

where a(n) (anti-)commutator is used when v is grassmann-even(-odd). expressions
become even simpler with use of the adjoint gauge representation matrix, which is
dened by

(t a)bc = itabc,

trt at b = c2(g)ab.

with this convention, the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation (2.8) can
be written as

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

where a component of the covariant derivative is dened by

dv = t a(ev )a,
(ev )a = (evb )abd(evb )bcv c,

 em,
and vb is the background gauge supereld in the adjoint representation

dmv = t a(emv )a,
{e, d } = 2im

vb = t av a
b.

the essence of the background eld method is to use the gauge xing condition
that is covariant under the background gauge transformation (2.5). we impose the
lorentz-type gauge xing condition and its conjugate

d

vq = f,

d2vq = evb f evb .

(2.13)

then the standard procedure 8) gives rise to the gauge xing term and the ghost-
anti-ghost term:

lvq/2  [(c + evb cevb ) + coth(lvq/2)  (c  evb cevb )]
(2.14)

where  is the gauge parameter. by construction, this action is invariant under
the background eld transformation, eq. (2.5) and b = eibei etc. note that,
since the parameter  of the quantum eld transformation (2.4) is chiral and the
gauge xing function f in eq. (2.13) is also chiral, all the ghost c, anti-ghost c, and
nielsen-kallosh ghost b are simply chiral superelds d c = d c = d b = 0.

3. supersymmetric gauge covariant regularization

in calculating radiative corrections to the eective action in the background eld
method, i.e., the generating functional of 1pi greens functions with all the external
lines being the background eld vb or b, we expand the total action st = s + s
in powers of the quantum eld, st = st 0 + st 1 + st 2 + st 3 + . (hereafter, a
number appearing in the subscript indicates the power of the quantum elds.) the
quadratic action is further decomposed as st 2 = sgauge

t 2 + sghost

t 2 + schiral

t 2 + smix
t 2 .

the rst part of the quadratic action, which is composed purely of the gauge

superelds, is given by

our regularization is then implemented as follows: we take propagators of the

then, for a nite ultraviolet cuto m , we modify the propagators so as to improve the
ultraviolet behavior and simultaneously preserve the background gauge covariance.

in these expressions, f (t) is the regulator, which decreases suciently rapidly f () =
f () = f () =  = 0 in the ultraviolet, and f (0) = 1 to reproduce the original
propagators in the innite cuto limit m  . in this way, the propagators obey
the same transformation law as the original ones under the background gauge trans-
formation on the background gauge supereld vb. in fact, it can easily be seen that
the propagator of the vector supereld, even with the modication (3.6), transforms
covariantly under the background gauge transformation (2.5):

gauge covariance of the scheme.

using the above propagators of the quantum elds, 1pi greens functions are
evaluated as follows. there are two kinds of contributions, because we have diago-
nalized s2 = sgauge
in constructing the propagators. (i) most of
radiative corrections are evaluated (as usual) by simply connecting quantum elds
in smix
t 2 , st 3, st 4, etc., by the modied propagators. this denes the rst part of
the eective action, i[vb, b], which is given by the 1pi part of

t 2 + sghost

t 2 + schiral

t 2

ht exp[i(st  s2)]i .

(3.12)

(ii) however, since the quadratic action s2 depends on the background gauge su-
pereld vb (but not on b) non-trivially, the one-loop determinant arising from

6

h. suzuki

the gaussian integration of exp(is2) has to be taken into account. we dene this
one-loop eective action as 4), 5)

.

(3.13)

here the indication vb  gvb implies that all vb-dependences involved are replaced
by gvb. the quantum elds in the vacuum expectation value are connected by the
modied propagators. this prescription for the one-loop eective action is character-
istic of our scheme and the prescription maximally respects the gauge covariance. 3), 5)
we will discuss this point in more detail in the next section.

the total eective action is then given by the sum  [vb, b] = i[vb, b] +

ii[vb].

(iii) when a certain composite operator o(z) is inserted in a greens function,

it is computed as usual (by using the modied propagators):

hto(z) exp[i(st  s2)]i .

(3.14)

it is easy to see that the rst part of the eective action i[vb, b] (which con-
tains all the higher loop diagrams) is always supersymmetric and background gauge
invariant. also a composite operator which behaves classically as a gauge covari-
ant supereld is regularized as a background gauge covariant supereld. on the
other hand, the one-loop eective action ii[vb] dened by eq. (3.13) is not nec-
essarily gauge invariant. this is assuring because if the whole eective action were
always gauge invariant then there would be no possibility of the gauge anomaly
that may arise from chiral multiplets loop. however, ii[vb] automatically re-
stores the gauge invariance without supplementing counterterms, when the gauge
anomaly dabc = tr t a{t b, t c} vanishes. we will explain this mechanism in the next
section. the prescription (3.14), on the other hand, is quite useful in evaluating the
quantum anomaly while preserving the supersymmetry and the gauge covariance (or
invariance). we will present several applications in the later section.

4. peculiarity of the one-loop eective action

our prescription (3.13) is a natural supersymmetric generalization of the gauge
covariant regularization in ref. 9). the idea behind eq. (3.13) is the following. we
rst introduce an auxiliary gauge coupling parameter g by vb  gvb. then we
may dierentiate the eective action ii[gvb] with respect to the parameter g and
integrate it over this parameter. noting that the g-dependences arise only through
the combination gvb, we have the rst line of eq. (3.13) as the formal representation.
in the second line, the regularization is specied with use of the modied propagators
in the preceding section. the crucial point for the property of the prescription is the

to see how the prescription (3.13) works, we consider the gauge variation of ii[vb]

under the innitesimal gauge transformation 6)

vb = ilvb /2  [( + ) + coth(lvb /2)  (  )],

(4.2)

i.e., the consistent gauge anomaly. 10) the variation of eq. (3.13) yields

we then insert dg/dg = 1 into the rst term and perform the integration by parts

note that the covariant anomaly (4.5) is proportional to the anomaly dabc, because

the right hand side is nothing but the covariant anomaly (4.5). quite interestingly,
the functional rotation (4.7) is a local functional of the gauge supereld, being pro-
portional to (a derivative of) the delta function (z  z), as we will see shortly. this
fact and eq. (4.8) imply that the functional rotation vanishes and consequently our
consistent anomaly (4.4) entirely vanishes, when the covariant anomaly vanishes.
namely, when the gauge representation of the chiral multiplet is anomaly-free, i.e.,
when dabc = 0, the one-loop eective action (3.13) automatically restores the gauge
invariance without supplementing any counterterms. in this sense, a breaking of the
gauge symmetry is kept to be minimal with the present prescription.

the direct calculation shows that for arbitrary variations 1 and 2, 5)

is a local object. the consistent gauge anomaly (4.4) is consequently given by 5)

it is obvious that our consistent anomaly is proportional to the anomaly dabc, as
expected. this anomaly must satisfy the wess-zumino consistency condition because
it is the gauge variation of the functional (3.13). in fact, eq. (4.10) coincides the
consistent anomaly due to marinkovic, 10) which was obtained as a solution of the
consistency condition.

we are interested in anomaly-free models for which the gauge anomaly (4.10)
vanishes. nevertheless it is interesting to examine the form of the anomaly (4.10) in

this expression of the usual gauge anomaly in the wz gauge is surprisingly simple

(4.12)

as another interesting case, we may consider the anomalous breaking of the
supersymmetry in the wz gauge, the so-called -susy anomaly. 12), 13) the super-
transformation in the wz gauge is a combination of the supersymmetric transfor-
mation generated by q + q (which is not anomalous in the present formulation)
and the gauge transformation  with the gauge parameter (z) = imvbm(y)
2b(y). 6) therefore we have the (apparent) breaking of supersymmetry as the
consequence of the gauge anomaly. by setting the gauge parameter  to this form
in eq. (4.10), we have

ii[v ]m =

b = imb + h.c., b =
where  is the super-transformation in the wz gauge vm
mnvbmn +idb. eq. (4.13) shows that eq. (4.10) reproduces the -susy anomaly
given in ref. 13) again with the non-supersymmetric local counterterm c (4.12). the
structure of eq. (4.12) is quite simple, compared to that of the counterterm required
in ref. 13) for obtaining the above minimal form. our anomaly is proportional
to dabc from the beginning and thus the possible (non-supersymmetric) counterterm
also must be proportional to dabc. this fact severely restricts the possible form of
(non-supersymmetric) counterterms.

for anomaly-free cases, the above prescription for the one-loop eective ac-
tion (3.13) can be shown to be equivalent 4) to (a supersymmetric generalization of)
the generalized pauli-villars regularization in ref. 14). since this is a lagrangian
level regularization whose hamiltonian is hermitian, the s-matrix is manifestly uni-
tary. (note that, in the m   limit, negative norm pauli-villars regulators cannot
contribute to the out-state of the physical s-matrix.)

5. one-loop greens functions

it is easy to evaluate one-loop two point greens functions with our scheme. 3)
to carry out actual calculations, we have to choose a form of the regulator. a simple
choice is

f (t) =

1

(t + 1)2 .

(5.1)

the self-energy part of the chiral multiplet, for example, is evaluated according to
the rule (3.12). this yields in terms of the eective action,)

the constant 5/6 depends on the choice of the regulator f (t).

6. super-chiral and superconformal anomalies

since our scheme gives a supersymmetric gauge covariant denition of composite
operators, it also provides a simple and reliable method to evaluate quantum anoma-
lies. in this section, we present several examples in the one-loop approximation.)

invariant regularization of supersymmetric chiral gauge theory

the rst example is the super-chiral anomaly, 15), 16), 11) which is dened as a

breaking of the ward-takahashi identity:

d

2dev (z)e +dt m(z)e = 0.

(6.1)

this identity is associated with the chiral symmetry of the massless action, (z) 
ei(z). we rst take in eq. (6.1) the quadratic terms in the quantum elds (i.e., the
one-loop approximation). then, according to eq. (3.14), we dene the regularized
super-chiral current as

qevb q(z)e =

which reproduces the well-known form of the super-chiral anomaly. (note that the
anomaly is independent of the choice of f (t).) for the actual calculation of the
second line, see ref. 3). the expression (6.4) holds even in chiral gauge theories,
and in this sense eq. (6.4) may be viewed as a supersymmetric version of the fermion
number anomaly. 2)

since we have dened the regularized composite operator in eqs. (6.2) and (6.3),
an anomalous supersymmetric commutation relation associated with the super-chiral
anomaly, the konishi anomaly, 17) can be derived straightforwardly. first we note in
the wess-zumino gauge, 6)

this is the konishi anomaly. 17) the point in the above derivation is that we have
dened the regularized composite operator rst; moreover, we did so in terms of
the supereld. therefore the supersymmetric transformation of the regularized
composite operator can be performed by one stroke of the dierential operator,

as we have done for the konishi anomaly, we may derive from the superconfor-
mal anomaly (6.19) the anomalous central extension of the n = 1 supersymmetry
algebra which has recently been advocated by shifman et. al. 20) an analysis of this
problem from the viewpoint of path integrals and the bjorken-johnson-low prescrip-
tion can be found in ref. 21). we rst note the denition of the supercharge:

  is the r-current. from these relations, we have

therefore we may dene the supersymmetric transformation of the supercurrent

where we have used the superconformal anomaly (6.19).) the central extension
of the n = 1 supersymmetry algebra 20) is obtained by integrating eq. (6.23) over
the spatial coordinate x. in deriving the second line from the rst line in eq. (6.23),
we have used the identity

which may be conrmed component by component.

in a similar way, we may study the anomalous commutator between the su-
percharge and the r-current. 22) the r-current is dened from the superconformal
current by

7. conclusion

(6.27)

in this talk, i introduced the recent attempt of our group for obtaining an invari-
ant regularization scheme in supersymmetric chiral gauge theories. i also presented
several applications in the one-loop level. although our scheme provides a unied
treatment of various problems in the one-loop level, the application to higher-loop
problems seems practically dicult. one reason is that use of the regulator f (t)
introduces complication in the feynman rule. another reason is the lack of the
manifest brs symmetry. nevertheless, we believe the idea to use the covariant
gauge current, such as in eq. (3.13), is basically the correct one. we are thus sup-
posing that a certain variation of the dimensional reduction 23) along the above idea
might make the scheme more practical.
