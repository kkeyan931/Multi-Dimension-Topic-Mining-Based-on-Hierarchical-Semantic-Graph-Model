abstract. recent work in the literature has proposed the use of non-local boundary

conditions in euclidean quantum gravity. the present paper studies rst a more general

form of such a scheme for bosonic gauge theories, by adding to the boundary operator for

mixed boundary conditions of local nature a 2  2 matrix of pseudo-dierential operators

with pseudo-homogeneous kernels. the request of invariance of such boundary conditions

under innitesimal gauge transformations leads to non-local boundary conditions on ghost

elds. in euclidean quantum gravity, an alternative scheme is proposed, where non-local

boundary conditions and the request of their complete gauge invariance are sucient to

lead to gauge-eld and ghost operators of pseudo-dierential nature. the resulting bound-

ary conditions have a dirichlet and a pseudo-dierential sector, and are pure dirichlet for

the ghost.

1. introduction

recent eorts in the literature have led to an elegant and useful characterization of gauge-

invariant boundary conditions for linearized quantum gravity and other fundamental eld

theories. the basic elements of the euclidean formulation are as follows [1].

a vector bundle v with connection  is given over an m-dimensional riemannian

manifold (m, g). physical elds are the smooth sections of v , and a part of the boundary

conditions is obtained by applying a projector  to the eld :

[]m = 0

(1.1)

where m is the smooth boundary of m . innitesimal gauge transformations map  into

 =  + r

(1.2)

where r is the generator and  is a gauge function (for gravity,  is a 1-form; for yang

mills,  is a smooth function on m ). remaining boundary conditions are obtained by

requiring that the action on  of the adjoint generator r should vanish on the boundary,

i.e.

[r]m = 0

(1.3)

where r  1re, e and  being the hermitian metrics on the vector bundles of

physical elds and gauge functions, respectively. equation (1.3) is equivalent to setting

to zero on the boundary the gauge-averaging functional (recall that gaussian averages over

gauge functionals are necessary to obtain an invertible gauge-eld operator in the one-loop

quantum theory [1]). the boundary conditions (1.1) and (1.3) can be re-expressed in the

convenient form [1]

(cid:18) 
 i  (cid:19)(cid:18) []m

[;n ]m(cid:19) = 0

0

where  is a rst-order dierential operator on the boundary:

 

1

2(cid:16)ibi + bii(cid:17) + s

2

(1.4)

(1.5)

i being a set of vector elds on m , b being the induced connection on m , and s being

an endomorphism (e.g. a term proportional to the trace of the extrinsic-curvature tensor

of the boundary). of course, ; n  n aa in eq. (1.4) is the standard notation for the

covariant derivatives along the inward-pointing normal to the boundary.

boundary conditions of the form (1.4) were rst considered, from the point of view

of pure mathematics, by gilkey and smith [2], and have been the object of increasing

interest in the analysis of heat-kernel asymptotics [37], string theory [8, 9] and euclidean

quantum gravity [1014]. on the other hand, it is precisely the attempt of applying such

a framework to the one-loop semiclassical approximation for the quantized gravitational

eld which has led to the discovery of a serious technical problem, i.e. the impossibility

of achieving a strongly elliptic boundary value problem [1, 15]. this is a mathematical

condition on the uniqueness of the solution of the eigenvalue equation for the leading

symbol l(p ) of the gauge-eld operator p when restricted to the boundary [1], subject

to a decay condition at innite geodesic distance from the boundary and to the boundary

conditions of the problem. if strong ellipticity fails to hold, the leading symbol l(p ) is no

longer invertible, and the functional trace of the heat operator acquires a non-integrable

part as one approaches the boundary along the inward geodesic ow. the l2-trace of

etp has then an asymptotic expansion, as t  0+, which contains not only the standard

interior and boundary terms [16], but also non-integrable contributions [1]. this makes

it impossible to use heat-kernel methods (only) to interpret the ultraviolet divergences of

the corresponding one-loop quantum theory.

in [17] it has been therefore suggested to look at boundary conditions in euclidean

quantum gravity from the point of view of pseudo-dierential boundary value problems.

indeed, not only has the functional calculus of pseudo-dierential boundary problems [18]

reached a status of high rigour, with several interesting results of general nature, but

relevant physical applications are already available in lower-dimensional theories [19]. in

the case of gravitational perturbations, the work in [17] has added to the local boundary

operator in eq. (1.4) a non-local boundary operator with kernel w cd

ab

(x, x), and special

assumptions on the components of w have been made to simplify the resulting calculations.

here we follow instead a more general path because we would like it to understand how far

3

can one go in allowing for non-local boundary data. for this purpose, section 2 considers

non-local boundary conditions for any bosonic gauge-eld theory. section 3 studies the

invariance properties of the boundary operator with the associated consistency conditions.

an alternative set of non-local boundary conditions in euclidean quantum gravity are

proposed and studied in section 4. concluding remarks are presented in section 5, and

relevant details are described in the appendix.

2. a new set of non-local boundary conditions

for bosonic eld theories, non-local boundary conditions add an integral operator to the

projectors, endomorphisms and rst-order dierential operators occurring in the purely

local theory (see eq. (1.4)). for example, as we already said in [17] following [18], in

population theory one studies the equation

u(0) z 

0

u(t)f (t)dt = 0.

(2.1)

we here consider a pseudo-dierential boundary operator dened by a kernel [16], so that

eq. (1.4) is replaced by the boundary condition

(cid:18)  + 

 + 

i   + (cid:19)(cid:18) []m

[;n ]m(cid:19) = 0.



(2.2)

in eq. (2.2) , ,  and  should be viewed as integral operators with kernels a, b, c and

d, respectively. in the case of metric perturbations hab, their action is taken to be

(h)ab(x) zm
(h)ab(x) zm
(h)ab(x) zm
(h)ab(x) zm

a pq

ab (x, x  x)hpq(x)dv 

b pq

ab

(x, x  x)hpq(x)dv 

c pq

ab

(x, x  x)hpq(x)dv 

d pq

ab

(x, x  x)hpq(x)dv 

4

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

where dv  is the integration measure over m , i.e.

dv  pdet g(x) dx1...dxm.

the form of the integrands in (2.3)(2.6) is consistent with our assumption of dealing

with a pseudo-dierential boundary operator. this is a technical point which is described

in detail in the appendix. with the notation dened therein, we say that a, b, c and

d are taken to be pseudo-homogeneous kernels. note that eq. (2.2) requires taking the

restriction to the boundary of what is obtained from (2.3)(2.6), e.g. (cf [17])

h(h)ab(x)im

=(cid:20)zm

a pq

ab (x, x  x)hpq(x)dv (cid:21)m

.

(2.7)

3. ghost boundary operator and consistency conditions

suppose that our bosonic gauge elds are subject to the innitesimal gauge transformations

(1.2), where the form of the generators r remains, for the time being, not specied. if both

 and  satisfy the boundary conditions (2.2), we say that such boundary conditions are

preserved under the action of r. the resulting boundary conditions on gauge functions

are

h( + )r + (r);nim

= 0

h( + )r + (i   + )(r);nim

= 0.

(3.1)

(3.2)

equations (3.1) and (3.2) should provide boundary conditions on the ghost while avoiding

an over-determined boundary value problem. for this purpose, assuming that  +  has

an inverse, we derive from (3.1) that

[r]m = h( + )1(r);nim

.

the insertion of such a formula into eq. (3.2) leads to

(cid:20)(cid:16)i   +   ( + )( + )1(cid:17)(r);n(cid:21)m

= 0.

5

(3.3)

(3.4)

the condition (3.4) should hold for all , to avoid having too many boundary conditions

after having imposed eq. (3.3). hence it becomes an operator equation which restricts

the form of the boundary operator, i.e.

i   +   ( + )( + )1 = 0.

(3.5)

it should be stressed that this equation can only make sense with non-local boundary

conditions, since otherwise  +  would reduce to , i.e. a projector for which no inverse

exists (the only map satisfying the properties t 2 = t and t t 1 = t 1t = i is the

identity i).

by contrast, if  is invertible while  +  cannot be inverted, eq. (3.1) can be cast

in the form

h(r);nim

= h1( + )rim

.

this implies, upon insertion into eq. (3.2), the consistency condition

(cid:20)(cid:16)( + )  (i   + )1( + )(cid:17)(r)(cid:21)m

= 0.

(3.6)

(3.7)

since eq. (3.7) should hold for all , it leads to an operator equation that restricts the

admissible form of the boundary operator, i.e. (cf (3.5))

 +   (i   + )1( + ) = 0.

(3.8)

for example, the form (3.6) of the ghost boundary conditions should be used when both

 and  +  are projection operators, so that the condition

implies that

( + )2 =  + 

2 +  +  = .

6

(3.9)

(3.10)

4. euclidean quantum gravity

in euclidean quantum gravity, the request of invariance under innitesimal dieomor-

phisms of homogeneous dirichlet conditions on spatial components of metric perturbations

leads to homogeneous dirichlet conditions on the whole ghost 1-form for all boundaries

which are not totally geodesic [12] (a boundary is said to be totally geodesic when its

extrinsic curvature tensor vanishes). at that stage, the vanishing of the gauge-averaging

functional a(h) at the boundary is imposed to ensure that this remaining set of bound-

ary conditions on metric perturbations leads again to homogeneous dirichlet conditions

on the ghost (with the exception of zero-modes) [1, 1015]. the dierence between the

present paper and the scheme considered in [1, 1015] lies, however, in the use of non-local

boundary operators (see also [20]).

we therefore assume that a(h) consists of the de donder term (which has the advan-

tage of leading to an operator of laplace type on metric perturbations with purely local

boundary conditions) plus a pseudo-dierential part with pseudo-homogeneous kernel, i.e.
(here h  gcdhcd)

a(h)  b(cid:18)hab 

gabh(cid:19) + (h)a

1
2

(4.1)

(4.2)

where

(h)a zm

 cd
a (x, x  x)hcd(x)dv .

as in [1],  is the connection on the bundle of symmetric rank-2 tensor elds over m ,

g is the background metric, and dv  is the integration measure over m used already in

(2.3)(2.6). moreover,  cd

a (x, x  x) is taken to be a pseudo-homogeneous kernel on the
curved m-dimensional riemannian background (m, g). by virtue of the assumption (4.2),

the standard rule for the evaluation of the ghost operator f b

a yields now a non-trivial

result, because (see (1.2))

a(h)  a(h) = f b

(4.3)

(4.4)

a being the pseudo-dierential operator dened by

 cd
a (x, x  x)(c d)(x)dv .

(4.5)

the gauge-eld operator p cd

ab

on metric perturbations is obtained by expanding to

quadratic order in hab the euclidean einsteinhilbert action and adding the integral over
m of a(h)a(h)

. on setting  = 1 for simplicity, one nds that

2

ab = g cd
p cd

ab + u cd

ab + v cd

ab

(4.6)

with our notation, g cd

ab

is the operator of laplace type given by [13]

g cd

where eabcd is the dewitt supermetric (i.e. the metric on the vector bundle of symmetric

rank-2 tensor elds over m )

eabcd 

1

2(cid:16)gacgbd + gadgbc  gabgcd(cid:17).

(4.8)

moreover, u cd

ab

and v cd

ab

are pseudo-dierential operators resulting from a(h)(h)a and

(h)a(h)a

2

respectively, in the expression of the gauge-averaging term a(h)a(h)

2

. to work

out the former, we use the identity

b(cid:20)(cid:18)hab 

gabh(cid:19)zm

2

 acd(x, x  x)hcd(x)dv 

 acd(x, x  x)hcd(x)dv .

(4.9)

8

we therefore add to the action a boundary term equal to (d being the integration measure

over m )

zm

n btbd

to nd that the action of u cd

ab

is dened by

ab hcd(x)  2rersabzm

u cd

 scd(x, x  x)hcd(x)dv .

(4.10)

furthermore, the denition (4.2) implies that v cd

ab

is a pseudo-dierential operator whose

action is dened by

hab v cd

ab

hcd(x)

zm 2

hab(x)pab(x, x  x) pcd(x, x  x)hcd(x)dv dv .

(4.11)

it should be stressed that the scheme considered in the present section diers sub-

stantially from the analysis of sections 2 and 3, because we have imposed the following

boundary conditions on metric perturbations:

[hij]m = 0

ha(h)im

=(cid:20)b(cid:18)hab 

gabh(cid:19) + (h)a(cid:21)m

1
2

= 0.

(4.12)

(4.13)

both (4.12) and (4.13) are invariant under innitesimal dieomorphisms if the whole ghost

1-form vanishes at the boundary, i.e.

[a]m = 0.

(4.14)

thus, we have proposed the general equations for an approach to euclidean quantum

gravity where both metric perturbations and ghost elds are ruled by pseudo-dierential

operators, while the boundary conditions have a dirichlet and a pseudo-dierential sector

(and are pure dirichlet for the ghost). as we know from the general analysis in [17] and

9

[18], the adjoint of the ghost operator will instead be a dierential operator, but subject

to non-local boundary conditions, to ensure self-adjointness.

5. concluding remarks

the theory of elliptic operators on compact riemannian manifolds (m, g) with or without

boundary is a fascinating topic which has led to several deep developments in mathematics

and theoretical physics [21]. there is, rst, the dirac operator obtained by composing

cliord multiplication with covariant dierentiation [21], i.e.

d  aa

(5.1)

whose symbol generates all elliptic symbols on a compact riemannian manifold, so that

this operator may be viewed as the most fundamental among all elliptic operators (and

also very well suited to studying topological properties of vector bundles over m ).

the laplace operator or, more generally, operators of laplace type

p : c(v, m )  c(v, m )

p  gabab  e

(5.2a)

(5.2b)

occurs whenever one tries to quantize bosonic gauge theories in linear covariant gauges via

path-integral methods [22]. its leading symbol is scalar [1, 16].

the next step is the consideration of non-minimal operators, whose leading symbol is

not of scalar type [16]. they are relevant for the quantization of bosonic gauge theories

in arbitrary gauges. an example is provided by the gauge-eld operator when the lorenz

gauge-averaging term is used for euclidean maxwell theory with arbitrary gauge parameter

, i.e.

p b
a   b
a

+(cid:18)1 

1

(cid:19) ab + r b

a .

(5.3)

a further step is given by the analysis of conformally covariant operators q. their

consideration is suggested by the behaviour under conformal rescalings

gab  e2gab

10

(5.4)

of the metric, since they are then found to transform according to the rule

q() = e(m+4)/2 q( = 0) e(m4)/2.

(5.5)

in other words, conformally covariant operators occur whenever conformal symmetries play

a key role in the process of understanding some features of a eld theory (e.g. supplemen-

tary conditions which are conformally invariant [23, 24]).

still, all the above operators are only particular cases of the general family of pseudo-

dierential operators [16, 18, 25]. while dierential operators d are local in that the

equation f = 0 implies df = 0 as well, this is no longer true for pseudo-dierential

operators, because their construction in rm involves the fourier transform, which smears

out the support [16]. moreover, their denition can be extended to riemannian manifolds

in a coordinate-free way [16]. a careful analysis of the role of pseudo-dierential operators

in euclidean quantum gravity is therefore quite important, because all what has been

achieved so far [13, 26] is only a particular case of a more general framework which is, to

a large extent, unexplored in the literature on quantum gravity [17].

in our paper, we have rst considered non-local boundary conditions in the form (2.2),

with the action of , ,  and  dened by polyhomogeneous kernels as in (2.3)(2.6). the

preservation of such boundary conditions under innitesimal gauge transformations leads

to the ghost boundary conditions (3.1) and (3.2). actually, eq. (3.1) has been required to

specify completely the behaviour of ghost elds at the boundary. equation (3.2) becomes

then a consistency condition which restricts the admissible forms of non-local boundary

operators (see (3.5) and (3.8)).

in euclidean quantum gravity, an alternative scheme has been built, with gauge-

averaging functional given by (4.1) and (4.2), ghost operator in the form (4.4) and (4.5),

operator on metric perturbations described by (4.6), (4.7), (4.10) and (4.11). interestingly,

non-local boundary conditions, jointly with the request of their complete gauge invariance,

are sucient to lead to gauge-eld and ghost operators of pseudo-dierential nature. the

resulting ghost boundary conditions are homogeneous dirichlet as in (4.14), and hence

dier from (3.1) and (3.2).

11

it now remains to be seen which one, among the schemes of sections 3 and 4, is best

suited to satisfy the requirement of strong ellipticity of the pseudo-dierential boundary

value problem (see denitions and theorems in section 1.7 of [18]). moreover, kernels of

distributional nature, rather than the polyhomogeneous kernels advocated in our paper,

might be studied as well, generalizing to curved backgrounds the analysis in [27]. at the

present stage, it is unclear whether both families of kernels are needed in quantum gravity,

or whether one of the two is more fundamental. last, but not least, it appears desirable to

investigate the role of non-local boundary conditions in quantum cosmology [13, 26, 28],

with application to 1-loop semiclassical eects and large-scale structure of the universe.

appendix

in [17] we have given some basic denitions about pseudo-dierential operators and their

symbols. in the present paper, however, we are interested in kernels of pseudo-dierential

operators, and hence we need a more advanced treatment. for this purpose, we follow

chapter iii of [25]. the basic concepts and results we need are as follows.

denition 1 let  be a complex number such that  6= 0, 1, 2, ..., and re() > . a

function f is a c pseudo-homogeneous function of degree , denoted by hf, if and
only if outside the origin f is a c function homogeneous of degree :

f (tx) = tf (x).

moreover, if  = 0, 1, 2, ..., then f is a hf if and only if

f (x) = p (x) log |x| + g(x)

(a.1)

(a.2)

12

where p is a polynomial of degree , and g is a c function homogeneous of degree ,

for which

z|x|=1

xg(x) = 0 || = .

(a.3)

denition 2 let u  r be open, and let k(x, xy) be dened for x, y in u , with x 6= y.

let re() > . then k is a pseudo-homogeneous kernel of degree , denoted by hk, if
and only if there exist functions k+j(x, z), of class c for z 6= 0 and pseudo-homogeneous

in z of degree  + j, such that

k(x, x  y) xj<j

k+j(x, x  y)

is of class ck for k < re() + j.

theorem 1 let re() < 0. then

a : c

c (u )  c(u )

is a pseudo-dierential operator of degree  if and only if

af (x) =zu

k(x, x  y)f (y)dy

(a.4)

where k is a pseudo-homogeneous kernel of degree   .

a theory with re()  0 might also be developed, leading to distributional kernels,

as is shown in [27]. two general principles underlie theorem 1:

(i) if the kernel k is homogeneous of degree s, then its fourier transform k is homogeneous

of degree s  . one can indeed write

k(t) =z eixtk(x)dx

and upon setting xt = y one nds

k(t) =z eiyk(yt1)t dy = ts k()

13

(a.5)

(a.6)

which proves our statement. however, the integral (a.5) is not absolutely convergent for

any value of s, and not even conditionally convergent for most values of s.

(ii) the behaviour of k near  is closely related to the behaviour of k near 0. this

property can be exploited to circumvent the convergence problem.

interestingly, one can pass from a pseudo-homogeneous kernel ks to a symbol as ; one
recovers as indirectly from the function as for suciently large .

all the above denitions and properties hold for pseudo-dierential operators on rm.

on extending the formalism to generic m-dimensional riemannian manifolds (m, g), it

remains to be proved in a rigorous way that it is sucient to replace dy  dy1...dym in

(a.4) by the integration measure pdet g(y) dy1...dym (see section 1.3 of [16]).
