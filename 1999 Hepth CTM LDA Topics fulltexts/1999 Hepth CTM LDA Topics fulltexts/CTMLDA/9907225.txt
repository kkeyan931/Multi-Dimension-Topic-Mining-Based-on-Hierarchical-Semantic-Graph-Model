fermionic partner known gauge boson, scalar partner known fermion, degenerate masses. experimentalists looking superpartners long hard, far vain, pushing limits superpartner masses roughly 100 gev. thus, discussion supersymmetry nature necessarily discussion broken supersymmetry. still, even broken supersymmetry theoretically appealing supersymmetry all. first, supersymmetry provides solution gauge hierarchy problem. without supersymmetry, scalar higgs mass quadratically divergent, natural scale fundamental scale theory, e.g., planck scale, many orders magnitude electroweak scale. supersymmetric theory, mass scalar higgs tied mass fermionic superpartner. since fermion masses protected chiral symmetries, higgs mass naturally around electroweak scale, radiative corrections destabilize hierarchy. success spoiled even explicit supersymmetry-breaking terms added lagrangian theory, long terms soft, is, introduce logarithmic divergences, quadratic divergences, scalar masses. appearance explicit supersymmetry-breaking terms low-energy eective theory theoretically justied underlying theory supersymmetric, yet vacuum state breaks supersymmetry spontaneously. spontaneously broken supersymmetry would explain stability gauge hi- erarchy radiative corrections, still explain origin hierarchy, is, origin small mass ratios theory. indeed supersymmetry broken classical level (tree level), scale soft terms would determined explicit mass parameters supersymmetric lagrangian, one would still understand parameters much smaller planck scale. however, origin 5 hierarchy understood supersymmetry broken dynamically (witten, 1981a). dynamical supersymmetry breaking (dsb) mean supersymmetry broken spontaneously theory possesses supersymmetric vacua tree level, breaking triggered dynamical eects. crucial point dsb supersym- metry unbroken tree-level, supersymmetric non-renormalization theorems (wess zumino, 1974; ferrara-iliopoulos-zumino, 1974; grisaru-rocek-siegel, 1979) imply remains unbroken orders perturbation theory, therefore broken non-perturbative eects, suppressed roughly e82/g2, g coupling. electroweak scale related size soft supersymmetry breaking terms, thus proportional supersymmetry breaking scale. latter suppressed exponential above, easily correct size, 17 orders magnitude planck scale. addition, supersymmetry, precisely, local supersymmetry, provides known framework consistent description gravity, context string theory. indeed underlying fundamental physics described string theory, one contemplate two qualitatively dierent scenarios. one susy directly broken stringy eects. then, however, susy breaking scale generically around string scale (barring new better understanding string vacua), thus gauge hierarchy problem solved supersymmetry. therefore, shall focus second possible scenario, namely, low-energy limit, string theory gives rise eective eld theory, supersymmetry spontaneously broken dynamics low-energy eective theory. aim review describe phenomenon dynamical supersymmetry (n counts number breaking eld theories n = 1 global supersymmetry. supersymmetries. n = 1 four supersymmetry charges smallest

studying supersymmetry breaking requires un- derstanding non-perturbative dynamics gauge theories infrared. fortunately, recent years, tremendous progress understanding dynamics su- persymmetric eld

interactions. holomorphy, together symmetries theory, may used determine physical degrees freedom superpotential infrared theory (seiberg, 1994; seiberg, 1995). since latter two precisely ingredients needed studying supersymmetry breaking, progress fueled discovery many new supersymmetry breaking theories, well new techniques establishing supersymmetry breaking. structure article follows. start

dynamical eects leading supersymmetry breaking understood stringy language (de boer et al, 1998). however, approach yet lead results cannot directly obtained eld theory analysis. limit review

generating acceptable superpartner spectrum. unfortunately, case. simple supersymmetry breaking extensions standard model without new gauge interactions, non-perturbative eects would probably small

(17) witten index nonzero, least one state zero energy, super- symmetry unbroken. index vanishes, supersymmetry may either broken, states zero energy, may unbroken, identical numbers fermionic bosonic states zero energy. witten index topological invariant theory. lies usefulness. may calculated convenient choice parameters theory, particular, weak coupling, result valid generally. see this, note 24 nite volume, fermionic bosonic states positive energy paired action susy generator: q|bei e|fei q|fei e|bei , (18) |bei (|fei) bosonic (fermionic) state energy e.10 (recall states zero energy annihilated q, therefore paired). thus, mild variations parameters theory, states may move zero energy zero energy, always bose-fermi pairs, leaving witten index unchanged. let us bit precise meant mild variations above. long parameter theory, originally nonzero, varied dierent nonzero value, expect witten index change, since dierent states move dierent energy levels pairs. danger lies appearance new states zero energy. happen asymptotic (in eld space) behavior potential changes, may happen parameter theory set zero, turned on. case, states may come innity move innity. index several theories calculated witten (1982). particular, witten found index pure supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory non-zero. 11 thus, theories break supersymmetry spontaneously. important corollary 10this fact justies including zero-energy states (17). states non-zero energy contribute. 11 su sp groups index equal r + 1, r rank group. number gaugino condensates groups. generally, index equals dual coxeter number group, dierent r + 1 groups, notably groups (witten, 1998). fact number gaugino condensates always equal r + 1, believed value index, remained puzzle resolution witten recently (witten, 1998). puzzle partly motivated conjecture sym theories vacuum gaugino condensate (kovner shifman, 1997). possibility would 25 sym theories massive matter (and massless matter) break supersym- metry either. reason that, least weak coupling, one take masses large, massless states theories beyond pure sym theory, value index pure sym theory. happens mass matter elds taken zero? theory zero mass directions, along potential classically zero (away directions potential behaves fourth power eld strength). contrast, theory mass matter elds classical directions, potential growing least quadratically large elds. thus, mass taken zero, asymptotic behavior potential changes, witten index may change too. fact, index ill-dened presence directions, since zero modes associated directions lead continuous spectrum states. (indeed, calculate index theory one needs consider theory nite volume resulting spectrum discrete.) therefore cannot say anything supersymmetry breaking massless, non-chiral theories based witten index pure sym theory. consider example sqcd n colors f avors mass m, discuss jqi qj, theory appendix 4a 7. explained there, presence mass terms mi n vacua qi qj = (3n f )/n (detm)1/n (m1)j j , (19) corresponding n roots unity. agreement witten index n pure su(n) gauge theory. consider massless limit, mi j 0. f < n, vacua (19) tend innity. theory ground state nite eld vevs. potential far-reaching consequences supersymmetry breaking. vast majority theories break susy virtue superpotential generated gaugino condensation. vacuum gaugino condensate would mean extra ground state, entire branch ground states, zero energy unbroken susy. 26 nonzero nite region eld space slopes zero innity. massless limit theory therefore well-dened. f > n, taking mi j 0 dierent ways, may attained. massless theory entire moduli space vacua, value j parameterized j . n = f case subtle, case too, theory moduli space vacua. thus, ground states massless su(n) theory f avors drastically dierent massive theory. examples explicitly see zero-energy states disappear innity, come innity. again, possible asymptotic behavior potential changes mass tends zero. theory including mass terms directions. asymptotically potential rises least quadratically. massless theory classical directions. quantum mechanically, completely lifted f < n, potential asymptotes zero fractional power eld. f n directions remain even quantum mechanically. case, adding mass terms changes asymptotic behavior potential. examples above, massive theory supersymmetric (with zero energy states nite elds vevs) massless theory either supersymmetric (with continuum vacua) well dened (with ground state). natural ask whether exist vectorlike (parity-conserving) theories break susy relevant masses taken zero. answer question armative shall see explicit example section vi 2. useful understand general properties potential theory. before, expect fully massive theory non-zero witten index. way obtain supersymmetry breaking masses taken zero, masses change asymptotic behavior potential. suppose nite value mass parameter m, theory possesses supersymmetric vacuum vev v0(m), moves away innity masses taken zero. clearly, small nite masses, directional derivative potential respect modulus negative large values v < v0(m). (the theory may various minima nite values v, interested asymptotic behavior potential large v.) absence phase transition zero mass, directional derivative remain 27 non-positive limit 0. however, still two possibilities. first, possible directional derivative negative nite vev, vanishes double limit, 0, v . case theory stable vacuum. however, also possible derivative vanishes limit 0 suciently large, otherwise arbitrary v. case, asymptotic behavior potential changes, becomes non-zero constant asymptotically far along direction, supersymmetry broken. however, potential at, running eects cannot neglected. indeed, shall argue section vi 2, eects may lift vacuum degeneracy determine true non-supersymmetric vacuum. summarize, pure sym theories, well vectorlike theories masses matter elds, non-zero index, break supersymmetry. masses taken zero, resulting theories classical directions, therefore, asymptotic behavior potential dierent massive theory. witten index may change discontinuously dier, well dened, massive theory. chiral (parity-violating) theories? theories, least matter elds cannot given mass. thus, theories cannot obtained deforming massive vectorlike theory, priori reason expect, based existing computations witten index, theories supersymmetric. indeed, known examples supersymmetry breaking chiral. b. global symmetries supersymmetry breaking section shall discuss connection global symmetries supersym- metry breaking, motivates two criteria supersymmetry breaking. useful guidelines nding supersymmetry-breaking theories, strict rules, shall encounter several exceptions following. consider rst theory exact, non-anomalous global symmetry, directions. global symmetry spontaneously broken, massless scalar eld, 28 goldstone boson, potential. unbroken supersymmetry, goldstone boson part chiral supermultiplet contains additional massless scalar, potential. scalar describes motions along direction zero potential. contradicts initial assumption directions. avoid contradiction drop assumption unbroken supersymmetry. gives powerful tool establishing supersymmetry breaking (aeck-dine-seiberg, 1984b; aeck- dine-seiberg, 1985): theory spontaneously broken global symmetry directions, theory breaks supersymmetry. assumed additional massless scalar corresponds motions along non-compact direction. often case, since, supersymmetric theories, su- perpotential invariant complexied global symmetry, goldstone boson corresponding imaginary part relevant order parameter, supersymmetric partner corresponding real part order parameter.12 general, deciding whether global symmetry broken requires detailed knowledge potential theory, least hard determining whether vacuum energy vanishes. however, theory strongly coupled scale supersymmetry might broken, one cannot directly answer either questions.13 still, cases, one may argue, based hooft anomaly matching conditions (t hooft, 1980), global symmetry broken. global symmetry unbroken ground-state, massless fermions 12the possibility low-energy theory theory goldstone bosons massless chiral elds supersymmetric scalar partner goldstone goldstone ruled out. theories coupled gravity discrete values newtons constant (bagger- witten, 1982), cannot describe low-energy behavior renormalizable gauge theories. 13the obvious example theory possess adjustable parameters, one scale, like su (5) model section iii d. 29 low-energy theory reproduce global triangle anomalies microscopic theory (t hooft, 1980). thus set elds, appropriate charges global symmetry, give solution anomaly-matching conditions. fact may used trying determine whether theory connes, global symmetries realized vacuum. example, gauge-invariants constructed microscopic elds theory saturate anomaly-matching conditions subgroup global symmetry microscopic theory, plausible theory connes, relevant symmetry subgroup remains unbroken vacuum. contrast, possible solutions anomaly-matching conditions complicated, is, require large set elds, plausible conclude global symmetry spontaneously broken. case r-symmetry another way determine whether spon- taneously broken. many theories, scale supersymmetry breaking much lower strong-coupling scale, supersymmetry breaking studied low- energy eective theory involving chiral superelds only, gauge dynamics integrated out. fact, low-energy theory oraifeartaigh-like model (with possibly negative exponents elds superpotential arising non-perturbative eects microscopic description). cases easy see origin excluded moduli space, because, example, potential diverges there. typically, terms appearing superpotential obtain vevs. since terms superpotential r-charge 2 implies r-symmetry broken. obviously argument applicable global symmetries superpotential necessarily neutral non-r symmetries. often easier prove r-symmetry broken, prove non-r symmetry broken. theory directions one conclude supersymmetry broken. surprising r-symmetries, commute supersymmetry, play special role supersymmetry breaking. let us discuss role further, following nelson seiberg (1994). 30 follows shall assume gauge dynamics integrated out. suppose low-energy theory superpotential w ({xi}), xi chiral elds = 1 . . . n. supersymmetry remain unbroken, superpotential extremal respect elds, w xi = 0 . theory symmetries, number unknowns, xi, equals number equa- tions. similarly, theory global symmetry commutes supersymmetry, number equations equals number unknowns. see note case, superpotential depend chiral eld combinations invariant symmetry. therefore, k symmetry generators, superpotential depends n k invariant quantities (for example, u(1) symmetry could xi/x = 2 . . . n, qi, q1 u(1) charges xi, x1 respectively) remaining k qi q1 1 , elds appear superpotential. thus, supersymmetry remain unbroken superpotential extremal respect n k variables, leading n k equations n k unknowns. thus, generically, solution supersymmetry unbroken. contrast, suppose theory r symmetry spontaneously broken. eld, x, r charge q 6= 0, gets non-zero vev. superpotential written w = x 2/qf (yi = x q /x qi) , qi charge xi. supersymmetry unbroken need f yi = 0 , f = 0 . thus one equation unknowns, generically expect solution. roughly speaking, mean generically superpotential generic function elds, is, contains terms allowed symmetries. shall return point shortly. 31 extremum superpotential determined system homogeneous linear equations, discussion would lead us conclude r-symmetry necessary condition supersymmetry breaking, spontaneously broken r-symmetry sucient condition. conclusion generally holds theories super- potential generic function consistent symmetries, may exceptions rule. f-atness conditions given system non-linear equations may contain negative powers elds (arising dynamical super- potential) well terms independent elds (arising linear terms, either generated dynamically included tree level superpotential). system equations guaranteed solutions. fact, already argued section ii c 1 one add explicit r-symmetry breaking terms oraifeartaigh model without restoring su- persymmetry. later shall encounter examples supersymmetry breaking models without r-symmetry. let us make bit precise mean generic superpotential. super- potential contains two parts. one generated dynamically, certainly contain terms allowed symmetries (seiberg, 1993). particular, terms could involve arbitrarily large negative powers elds. part classical superpotential, polynomial (of degree d) elds, preserves global symmetry. mean generic term, dimension smaller equal allowed global symmetry omitted superpotential. hand, tree-level superpotential still considered generic operators dimension higher omitted. indeed, renormalizable lagrangian stable vacuum expect planck scale vevs. analysis nelson seiberg (1994) shows inclusion non-renormalizable operators produce additional minima planck scale vevs, region eld space approximation global supersymme- try sucient anyway. hand, models stable vacuum appears inclusion non-renormalizable terms dimension d, typical expectation values depend planck scale (or large scale) often remain much 32 smaller it. long expectation values small compared planck scale, minima remain stable local minima even operators dimension higher added. shall encounter several examples theories break supersymmetry even though possess r symmetry. cases, microscopic theory r symmetry, eective, spontaneously broken r symmetry low energy theory. cases, even eective r symmetry. one example, susy broken even though tree-level superpotential generic preserve r-symmetry, eective r-symmetry. c. gaugino condensation let us introduce criterion susy breaking based gaugino con- densation (meurice veneziano, 1984; amati-rossi-veneziano, 1985). suppose certain chiral supereld (or linear combination chiral superelds) appear superpotential, yet moduli stabilized. case konishi anomaly (konishi, 1984; clark-piguet-sibold, 1979) implies d2( ev ) trw 2 , (20) supersymmetric covariant derivative (see appendix 1), chiral supereld v vector supereld. instructive consider eq. (20) component form. given anomalous commutator supersymmetry generator q, {q, } , (21) fermionic scalar components respectively, gaugino. equation see vacuum energy proportional lowest component w 2, is, < tr >. therefore, gaugino condensate forms one conclude supersymmetry broken. note elds appear 33 superpotential, right-hand side eqs. (20) (21) modied gaugino condensate may form without violating supersymmetry. example, superpotential mass term, eq. (21) becomes {q, } = + 1 322 . (22) latter equation compatible supersymmetry determines vevs scalar elds terms gaugino condensate. criterion related global symmetry arguments aeck-dine-seiberg (1985), since gaugino condensate develops theory possessing r-symmetry, symmetry spontaneously broken. absence directions, aeck-dine-seiberg argument leads conclusion susy broken. d. examples shall demonstrate techniques described iii b iii c examples. 1. spontaneously broken global symmetry: su (5) model consider su(5) gauge theory one antisymmetric tensor (10) a, one anti- fundamental f (aeck-dine-seiberg, 1984b; meurice veneziano, 1984). global symmetry theory u(1) u(1)r, take charges elds a(1, 1) f (3,9). gauge invariants one make f . thus directions, classically theory unique vacuum origin. theory strongly coupled near origin, way determine behavior quantum theory. chiral gauge invariants, theory admit superpotential. supersymmetry broken, possible scale breaking strong coupling scale su(5). following aeck-dine-seiberg (1984b) shall use r-symmetry argue su- persymmetry indeed broken (we shall consider gaugino condensation argument due 34 meurice veneziano, (1984) following subsection). assuming theory connes, massless gauge-invariant fermions conned theory reproduce triangle anomalies generated microscopic theory. aeck-dine-seiberg (1984b) showed minimal number fermions required, u(1) u(1)r charges 50, ve. makes quite implausible full global symmetry remains unbroken. global symmetry spontaneously broken directions, theory breaks supersymmetry arguments iii b. 2. gaugino condensation: su (5) model would like apply gaugino condensate argument su(5) model dis- cussed previous subsection. since gaugino condensate serves order parameter supersymmetry breaking, need establish non-zero. follow meurice veneziano (1984) consider correlation function (x, y, z) = dt (2(x), 2(y), (z))e , = abcdea b af c abcabcade , (23) (24) f scalar components 5 10 respectively. limit x, y, z 1 one show condensate 13. one take limit large x, y, z using cluster decomposition properties argue < >6= 0. result supersymmetry must broken. 3. r-symmetry susy breaking example su(5) model could explicitly verify spontaneous break- ing global symmetry, rely use hooft anomaly matching conditions establish supersymmetry breaking. consider examples one 35 explicitly show r-symmetry spontaneously broken, use establish supersymmetry breaking. shall content consider models tree level breaking, similar arguments applied number dynamical models discussed later. consider rst oraifeartaigh model eq.
