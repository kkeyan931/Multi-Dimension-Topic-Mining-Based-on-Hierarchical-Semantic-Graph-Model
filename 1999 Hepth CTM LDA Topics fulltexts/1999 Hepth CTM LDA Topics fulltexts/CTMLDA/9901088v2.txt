abstract

we construct the supergravity solution for the intersecting d1-d5 brane sys-
tem in type i string theory. the solution encodes the dependence on all the
electric charges of the so(32) gauge group. we discuss the near horizon geome-
try of the solution and a proposed dual (0, 4) superconformal eld theory.

1 introduction

the d1-d5 brane system in type i string theory may provide us with yet another
example of a duality between superstring theory on ads3 background and two dimen-
sional scft. we will consider the system of parallel d1 and d5 branes with charges
qe and qp respectively, where the d5 branes wrap a compact space m which is t 4 or
k3. the purpose of this letter is to construct the corresponding supergravity solution
with non-zero so(32) gauge elds.

the supergravity solution in type i theory describing d1 and d5 branes intersecting
in one spatial dimension has been constructed in [1] and partially in [2, 3]. however,
in these solutions the so(32) gauge group in the open string sector is not turned
on. therefore, they are not complete type i solutions, as the consistency of the
type i superstring theory without spacetime anomalies requires the existence of the
so(32) gauge group. this is what distinguishes the type i supergravity solutions
from the corresponding solutions in the type iib theory. we will therefore construct
the supergravity solution for the intersecting d-brane conguration with all the 496
electric charges of the so(32) gauge group turned on.

the strategy which we will use is to rst construct the supergravity solution for
intersecting fundamental strings and ns5-branes with non-zero so(32) gauge eld in
the heterotic theory and then apply the s-duality transformation relating type i and
so(32) heterotic string theories to obtain the required type i solution.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we briey review the type i - so(32)
heterotic duality in ten dimensions. we then discuss the technique for generating the
solution. finally, we present the non-extreme as well the bps heterotic and type i
solutions. in section 3 we construct the near horizon geometry of the type i solution
and discuss a proposed duality to a (0, 4) scft in two dimensions.

2 the supergravity solution

in this section, we construct the supergravity solution of type i superstring theory
describing intersecting d1 and d5 branes with non-zero so(32) gauge eld. for this
purpose, we rst construct intersecting fundamental string and ns5-brane solution
with non-zero so(32) gauge group in heterotic theory and then apply the s-duality
transformation relating type i and so(32) heterotic string theories to obtain this type
i theory solution.

2.1 type i - so(32) heterotic duality in ten dimensions

in this subsection, we summarize the s-duality transformation that relates the type
i superstring to the so(32) heterotic superstring in ten dimensions for the purpose of
xing notations.

the bosonic part of the low energy eective action for the so(32) heterotic string
theory is described by the massless bosonic string states, which are the graviton g(h)
m n
(m, n = 0, 1, ..., 9), the dilaton (h) and the two-form eld b(h)
m n in the ns sector of
the closed heterotic string along with gauge elds a(h) a
(a = 1, ..., 496) in the adjoint
representation of the so(32) gauge group. the action in the string frame is given by

here, the trace tr is in the vector representation of so(32).

the type i superstring theory is dened as the orientifold projection of the type
iib superstring theory. in the massless bosonic ns sector of the closed string, only the
graviton g(i)
m n and the dilaton (i) survive the orientifold projection. in the bosonic
rr sector, the only surviving massless mode is the two-form eld b(i)
m n . the bosonic
open string sector gives rise to gauge elds a(i) a
m (a = 1, ..., 496) of the so(32) gauge
group. in the string frame, these massless bosonic modes are described by

s(i) =

of b(i)
m are dened similarly as above.

m n , and eld strengths h (i)

note, these two theories have the same eld contents and also the same supersym-
metry. in fact, the actions (1) and (3) become identical, provided one relates the elds
in the two actions in the following way [4]:

m n = e (i)
g(i)

2 g(h)

m n , (i) = (h), b(i)

m n = b(h)

m n , a(i)

m = a(h)

since gs = ehi is dened as the string coupling constant, one sees that the strong
coupling limit of one theory is related to the weak coupling limit of the other theory.
under this s-duality transformations, the fundamental string [the solitonic ns5-brane]
of the heterotic theory and the d-string [the d5-brane] in the type i theory are related.

2.2 solution generating technique

fundamental strings and (solitonic) ns5-branes in heterotic string respectively carry
electric and magnetic charges of the ns two-form eld b(h)
m n . additionally, we want
the p-brane conguration to be charged under the so(32) gauge group. we are there-
fore interested in the conguration which carries electric charges of the so(32) gauge
group, i.e. the so-called colored non-abelian solution . such solutions are constructed
by embedding the u(1) groups in the non-abelian gauge group as the adjoint repre-
sentation. namely, one takes the ansatz for the non-abelian so(32) gauge eld a(h) a
of the form a(h) a
m = aam , where am is an u(1) gauge eld and the parameters a
satisfy the constraint abab = 1. here, ab is an invariant metric of the so(32) group.
then, the eld strength f (h)
m n (2) of the non-abelian so(32) gauge group reduces to
the eld strengths f (h) a
m = aam . so, the
eective action (1) becomes that with 496 abelian u(1) gauge elds. in particular, 496
electric charges q(h) a of the u(1) gauge elds form the adjoint representation of the
so(32) gauge group. one can induce these p-brane charges and the electric charges of
the so(32) gauge group on the uncharged black p-brane solution by rst compactifying
it down to 3 dimensions and then applying the appropriate boost transformations in
the u-duality symmetry of the 3-dimensional action.

m n = af 0

since we are interested in constructing the intersecting fundamental string and ns5-
brane solution which is localized along the overall transverse directions, only, we start
from the following uncharged black vebrane solution in d = 10:

(5)

one can compactify the solution (5) in the t, xi and 2 directions on a torus down to
three dimensions, since the solution is independent of these coordinates. the kaluza-
klein ansatz of the metric for such compactication is given by

g(h)

m n = (cid:18) eh + gmnam

(6)

the other class of solutions, which are regarded as genuine non-abelian solutions, are neutral
under the non-abelian gauge group, i.e. do not carry global charges of the non-abelian gauge
group.

where   (h)  1
2 ln det gmn is the 3-dimensional dilaton and the indices run as
,  = r, , 1 and m, n = t, 2, x1, ..., x5. the ten-dimensional heterotic action (1)
compacties to the following three-dimensional form, which we write down only the
nal form as the details on its derivation and the eld denitions can be found elsewhere
[5, 6, 7]:

l =

h(cid:20)rh +

8

htr(mlml)(cid:21) ,

(7)

where rh is the ricci scalar of the metric h. note, since we keep all the 496 u(1)
gauge elds in the adjoint representation of the so(32) gauge group, the scalar moduli
matrix m is now an o(8, 504) matrix and l is an invariant metric of the o(8, 504)
group. the action (7) is invariant under the following o(8, 504) duality transformation:

h  h, m  mt ,

(8)

where   o(8, 504). the so(1, 1) boost transformations in this o(8, 504) transfor-
mation group induce electric and magnetic charges of p-branes and u(1)496  so(32)
gauge group on the uncharged solution (5).

2.3 non-extreme solutions

2.3.1 heterotic solution

after applying the so(1, 1) boost transformations in the o(8, 504) duality group (8)
with the boost parameters e, p and a (a = 1, ..., 496) on the uncharged black 5-
brane solution (5) compactied down to three dimensions, one obtains the following
non-extreme supergravity solution describing the intersecting fundamental string and
ns5-brane with 496 electric charges of the so(32) gauge group:

conguration are given by

qe = m sinh e cosh e( + 1), qp = 2m sinh p cosh p,
qa = 2m cosh2 e sinh aa.

(11)

note, in the limit where the electric charges qa of the so(32) gauge group are
zero (a = 0), the solution (9) reduces to the non-extreme version of the intersecting
fundamental string [8] and ns5-brane [9, 10] solution.

2.3.2 type i solution

the following non-extreme supergravity solution describing the intersecting d1 and d5
branes in the type i string theory is obtained by applying the s-duality transformation

the d1 brane charge qe, the d5 brane charge qp and electric charges qa of the

u(1)496  so(32) gauge group are given as in (11).

in the limit that the electric charges qa of the so(32) gauge group are zero (a = 0),
the solution (12) reduces to the non-extreme generalizaton of the intersecting d1 and
d5 brane solution constructed in [1].

2.4 the bps solutions

the bps limit of the above solutions (9) and (12) is dened as the limit in which the
non-extremality parameter m goes to zero while keeping 2m sinh e cosh e  q and
2m sinh p cosh p = qp as nite non-zero constants. in the following, we write down
the p-brane solutions (9) and (12) in the bps limits.

3 the near-horizon geometry and (0, 4) scft

the decoupling limit of the worldvolume theory of the intersecting d-brane congura-
tion corresponds to the near-horizon limit of the corresponding supergravity solution.
the near-horizon geometry of the supergravity solution (14) is obtained by keeping
only the 1/r2 terms in the harmonic functions in the solution. the resulting metric
has the following form:

ads = r2

this corresponds to the metric describing ads3  m  s3 with the radii of ads3 and
s3 being r2

qqeqp
s3 = qqeqp and the volume of m being vm = qe/qp.

the d1-d5 brane conguration in type i string theory is expected to encode the
information on the moduli space of instantons on m. the worldvolume theory of k
at d5-branes in type i theory has as its higgs branch the moduli space of so(32) k-
instantons on r4 [11]. using a d1 brane probe extending parallel to the d5-branes, one
gets the adhm data encoded in the yukawa couplings of the (0, 4) sigma model of d1
brane worldvolume theory [12, 13]. more precisely, the condition for (0, 4) supersym-
metry of the sigma model requires that the couplings satisfy the adhm equations. for
every instanton, one gets a (0, 4) sigma model that ows in the infrared to a solution of
string theory for the corresponding instanton. this generalizes to other non-compact
manifolds such as ale spaces where a similar adhm construction exists.

when the d5 branes wrap a compact manifold m, there should presumably be a
similar relation between the (0, 4) theory on the d1 brane worldvolume to the instanton
moduli space. this is not yet known. in the spirit of other examples of the ads/scft
correspondence [14, 15, 16] one is led to conjecture that the (0, 4) scft in the infrared
limit of the d1 brane worldvolume theory is dual to type i string theory on the
ads3  m  s3 background (17). the supergroup su(1, 1/2)  sl(2, r)  su(2) of
the type i compactication is mapped under the conjectured duality to the symmetry
supergroup of the (0, 4) scft.

for charges qe, qp >> 1, one can use the supergravity approximation. the super-
gravity theory can be reduced rst on m from ten to six dimensions. one can then
study the spectrum of the kaluza-klein excitations of n = 1 supergravity on ads3s3
as in [19]. it will be interesting to construct the string theory picture as done for the
d1-d5 system in type iib string theory [20].
