abstract

light cone form of eld dynamics in anti-de sitter spacetime is developed. using eld
theoretic and group theoretic approaches the light cone representation for generators of
anti-de sitter algebra acting as dierential operators on bulk elds is found. we also
present light cone reformulation of the boundary conformal eld theory representations.
making use of these explicit representations of ads algebra as isometry algebra in the
bulk and the algebra of conformal transformations at the boundary a precise correspon-
dence between the bulk elds and the boundary operators is established.

introduction

in spite of its lorentz noncovariance, the light cone formalism [1] oers conceptual and
technical simplications of approaches to various problems of modern quantum eld
theory. for example, one can mention the construction of light cone string eld theory
[2]-[5] and supereld formulation for some versions of supersymmetric theories [69].
sometimes, a theory formulated within this formalism turns out to be a good starting
point for deriving a lorentz covariant formulation [10, 11]. another attractive application
of the light cone formalism is a construction of interaction vertices in the theory of higher
spin massless elds [12]-[16]. some interesting applications of light cone formalism to
eld theory like qcd are reviewed in [17]. discussion of super p-branes and string bit
models in the light-cone gauge is given in [18, 19] and [20] respectively.

till now the light cone formalism was explored in minkowski spacetime (for a review
see [10]). the major goal of this paper is to develop light cone form of eld dynamics in
anti-de sitter space time. a long term motivation comes from a number of the following
potentially important applications.

one important application is to type iib superstring in ads5  s5 background.
motivated by conjectured duality between the string theory and n = 4, d = 4 sym
theory [21]-[23] the green-schwarz formulation of this string theory was suggested in
[24] (for further developments see [25]-[30]). despite considerable eorts these strings
have not yet been quantized (some related interesting discussions are in [31]-[33]). as is
well known, quantization of gs superstrings propagating in at space is straightforward
only in the light cone gauge. it is the light cone gauge that removes unphysical degrees
of freedom explicitly and reduces the action to quadratical form in string coordinates.
the light cone gauge in string theory implies the corresponding light cone formulation
for target space elds. in the case of strings in ads background this suggests that we
should rst study a light cone form dynamics of target space elds propagating in ads
spacetime. understanding a light cone description of ads target space elds might help
to solve problems of strings in ads spacetime.

the second application is to a theory of higher massless spin elds propagating in ads
spacetime. some time ago a completely self-consistent interacting equations of motion for
higher massless elds of all spins in four-dimensional ads spacetime have been discovered
[34]. for generalization to higher spacetime dimensions see [35]. despite eorts the
action that leads to these equations of motion has not yet been obtained. in order to
quantize these theories and investigate their ultraviolet behavior it would be important
nd an appropriate action. since the higher massless spin theories correspond quantum
mechanically to non-local point particles in a space of certain auxiliary variables, it is
conjectured that they may be ultraviolet nite (see [36],[37]). we believe that a light
cone formulation is what is required to understand these theories better. the situation
here may be analogous to that in string theory; a covariant formulation of closed string
eld theories is non-polynomial and is not useful for practical calculations, while the
light cone formulation restricts the string action to cubic order in string elds.

keeping in mind these extremely important applications, in this paper we develop
and apply the light cone formalism to the study of ads/cft correspondence at the
level state/operators matching. as is well known in the case of the massless elds,

2

investigation of ads/cft correspondence requires analysis of some subtleties related
to the fact that transformations of bulk massless elds are dened up to local gauge
transformations. these complications are absent in the light cone formulation because
here we only deal with physical elds and this allows us to demonstrate ads/cft
correspondence in a rather straightforward way.

in this paper we will focus on the light cone formalism for integer (bosonic) arbitrary
spin massless elds that can be formulated in any dimension. there is a number of
reasons for this. first, the massless case is the simplest one to demonstrate all essential
new features of light cone formalism in ads spacetime. second, higher spin massless
eld theory is an interesting and important subject which itself should be studied in
detail. we develop also light cone formulation for massive elds but in this case we
do not discuss the ads/cft correspondence. since the method we use is algebraic in
nature, an extension of our results to the case of half integer spin elds (fermions) is
straightforward and will be done elsewhere. a generalization to the case supersymmetric
theories is relatively straightforward and will be studied in future.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we describe various forms of the

so(d  1, 2) algebra and explain our notation.
in section 3 we develop light cone formulation by using eld theoretic approach.
first we discuss the simplest case of spin one maxwell eld. next we generalize our
discussion to the case of totally symmetric and antisymmetric elds. we nd an explicit
representation for generators of anti-de sitter algebra acting as dierential operators
acting on elds of arbitrary spin.

based on these results in section 4 we establish dening equations for the ads al-
gebra generators for arbitrary symmetry type elds. we demonstrate that a eld in d
dimensional ads spacetime can be considered as a massive particle in (d  1) at space
time with a continuous mass spectrum. we explicitly match the ads algebra generators
acting on bulk elds with conformal algebra generators acting on elds with continuous
mass spectrum. this interrelation is behind ads/cft correspondence but it also sug-
gests an idea of how massless higher spin elds in ads space time and string theory at
the boundary could be related. we shall briey comment on this point.

in section 5 we use group theoretic approach to solve the dening equations. in this
section we develop light cone form of ads generators for both massless and massive
elds. we establish close correspondence between eld theoretic and group theoretic
approaches.

for comparison of boundary values of bulk light cone elds with operators of bound-
ary conformal theory we need to develop a light cone formulation of conformal theories
too. to our knowledge this formulation was not previously given in the literature. in
section 6 we present light cone formulation of conformal eld theory for the case of arbi-
trary spin totally symmetric operators. we consider operators with canonical dimension
as well as their conformal partners (which are sometimes referred to as shadow operators
or sources). we investigate correspondence between solutions of equations of motion for
totally symmetric bulk elds and operators of boundary conformal theory. we demon-
strate that normalizable modes of bulk eld are related to conformal operators while
non-normalizable modes are related to conformal partners of these conformal operator.
section 7 summarizes our conclusions and suggests directions for future research.

appendices contain some mathematical details and useful formulae.

2 various forms of so(d  1, 2) algebra and notation
first let us discuss the forms of ads algebra, that is so(d  1, 2), we are going to use.
ads algebra of d dimensional ads spacetime consists of translation generators p a and
rotation generators j ab which span so(d  1, 1) lorentz algebra. the commutation
relations of ads algebra are

[ p a, p b] = 2 j ab ,

[ j ab, j ce] = bc j ae + 3 terms ,

[ p a, j bc] = ab p c  ac p b ,

ab = (, + . . . , +) ,

a, b, c, e = 0, 1, . . . , d  1 .

the  is a cosmological constant of ads spacetime. throughout of this paper we use
antihermitean form of generators: g = g. as   0 the ads algebra becomes the
poincare algebra

p a = p a

p oin ,

j ab = j ab

p oin .

this form algebra is not convenient for our purposes. we prefer to use the form provided
by nomenclature of conformal algebra. namely we introduce new basis

(2.2)

in the conformal algebra basis one has the following well known commutation relations

[d, p a] = p a ,

[d, k a] = k a ,

[p a, p b] = 0 ,

[k a, k b] = 0 ,

[p a, j bc] = abp c  acp b ,
[p a, k b] = abd  j ab ,
ab = (, +, . . . +) ,

[k a, j bc] = abk c  ack b ,
[j ab, j ce] = bcj ae + 3 terms ,
a, b, c, e = 0, 1, . . . , d  3, d  1 .

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

in this form the ads algebra is known as the algebra of conformal transformations in (d
1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime. in sections 2-5 we shall be interested in realization

4

of this algebra as the one of transformations of massless bulk elds propagating in d-
dimensional ads spacetime while in section 6 we shall realize this algebra as the algebra
of conformal transformations on appropriate operators.

throughout of this paper we shall use poincare parametrization of ads spacetime in

which

ds2 =

1
z2 (dt2 + dx2

i + dz2 + dx2

d1) .

z > 0 .

here and below we set cosmological constant  equal to unity. the boundary at spatial
innity corresponds to z = 0. 1 the killing vectors in these coordinates are given by2

p a, = a ,

d, = x ,

k a, = 

j ab, = xab  xba , (2.7)
while the corresponding generators are dened as g = g,. to develop light cone
formulation we introduce light cone variables x , xi where we use the convention

xi = xi, z;

x0  t, xd2  z

i, j, k, l = 1, . . . , d  2 ,

i, j, k, l = 1, . . . , d  3 .

in this notation scalar product of tangent vectors is decomposed as

aaba = a+b + ab + aibi ,

aibi = aibi + azbz

i.e. we use the convention ad2 = az. the coordinate x+ is considered as an evolution
parameter. here and below to simplify our expressions we will drop the metric tensors
ab, ab in scalar products.

because we are going to describe the elds in the light cone gauge let us discuss
light cone form of the above algebra. in light cone formalism the ads algebra splits into
generators

which we refer to as kinematical generators and

p +, p i, j +i, k +, k i, d, j +, j ij

p , j i , k 

(2.8)

(2.9)

which we refer to as dynamical generators. kinematical generators are realised quadrat-
ically in physical elds while dynamical generators receive corrections in interaction
theory. in this paper we deal with free elds. the light cone form of ads algebra can be
obtained from (2.3)-(2.5) with the light cone metric having the following non vanishing
elements + = + = 1, ij = ij.

1poincare coordinates cover half of ads spacetime. because we are interested in local transformation

laws of physical elds the global description of ads spacetime is not important for our study.

2the indices ,  take values 0, 1, . . . , d  1.

5

instead of target space tensor elds we prefer to use tangent space tensor elds. to
pass to tangent space tensor elds we should introduce local frame. one convenient
choice is specied by the frame one-forms ea = ea

the connection one-forms, dened by dea + ab  eb = 0, are then given by

to describe totally antisymmetric elds we use anticommuting oscillators3

|i = a1...asa1 . . . as|0i ,

{ a, b} = 0 ,
while for description of symmetric elds we use commuting oscillators

{ a, b} = ab ,

{a, b} = 0 ,

(2.12)

[a, b] = ab ,

[a, b] = 0 ,

[a, b] = 0 .

3 light cone formulation of eld dynamics in ads

spacetime. field theoretical approach

in this section we shall develop light formulation of eld dynamics in ads spacetime
by applying eld theoretic approach. the basic strategy, which is well known, consists

3throughout of this paper we use a convention {x, y} = xy + yx

6

of the following steps. first we start with gauge invariant equations of motion for free
elds in ads background. we shall impose light cone gauge, solve the constraints, and
derive equations of motion for physical degrees of freedom. next we shall use the original
global ads group transformations of gauge elds supplemented by gauge transformation
to maintain the gauge. from these we shall get realization of ads algebra on the space
of physical degrees of freedom.

3.1 maxwell eld. light cone form of equations of motion

as a warm up let us consider spin one maxwell eld. instead of a with the equations of
motion df  = 0 we introduce tangent eld a dened by (2.10) and use the following
form for equations of motion in tangent space

dbf ba = 0 ,

fab = dab  dba ,

(3.1)

where f ab is the eld strength in the tangent space while da is covariant derivative

dab = ab + abcc .

in poincare coordinates one has

and eld strength takes the form

dab = ab + z

ba  abz

fab = ab  ba + z

ba  z

ab .

the equations (3.1) can be cast into the form

and one has then the following second equations of motion for the gauge eld a

bf ba + (2  d)f za = 0

( 2 + (1  d) z + d  2)a  a( ) + (d  3) az
+(2  d)a

z ( ) = 0 .

z z + 2a

since these equations are invariant with respect to the gauge transformation

we can impose the light cone gauge

a = a

+ = 0 .

(3.2)

(3.3)

inserting this into equations (3.2) we get the following constraint4

4recall that in the minkowski spacetime the maxwell equations in gauge + = 0 lead to the lorentz
constraint aa = 0. this is not the case in ads spacetime. here, by virtue of the relation daa =
 + (1  d)z, the constraint (3.4) does not coincide with the lorentz constraint daa = 0.

from (3.4) we express the  in terms of the physical eld5

 = (d  3)z .

(3.4)

(3.5)

note that the second term in r.h.s. of equation (3.5) is absent in at space. it is this
term that breaks so(d  2) manifest invariance and reduce it to so(d 3) one. by virtue
of the constraint (3.4) the equations of motion take the form

( 2 + (1  d) z + d  2)a + (d  4)a

z z = 0 .

from this we get the following equations for the physical elds i, z:

( 2 + (1  d) z + d  2)i = 0 ,

( 2 + (1  d) z + 2d  6)z = 0 .

since this form of equations of motion is not convenient we introduce new physical eld
i dened by6

in terms of i the equations of motion take the form

i = z(d2)/2i .

(3.10)

from equations of motion (3.7), (3.8) we see that in d = 4 the mass like terms cancel.
this fact reects the conformal invariance of spin one eld in four dimensional ads
spacetime. gauge invariant action for spin one maxwell eld

5here as well as while obtaining the constraint (3.4) we assume, as usual in light cone formalism,

that the operator + has trivial kernel.

(3.11)

3.2 light cone form of transformations for spin one physical

degrees of freedom

now let us consider transformation laws of physical elds i. toward this end we start,
as usual, with original global ads symmetries, supplemented by compensating gauge
transformation required to maintain the gauge

(3.12)
where  are the ads target space killing vectors and l is the lie derivative given by

tota = la +  ,

in terms of tangent eld a (2.10) and tangent space killing vectors7

la = a  a .

the transformations (3.12) take the form

a  ea

 

tota = la + a ,

where l is given by

la = bdba  bdba .
in poincare coordinates we use one has the representation

where    a a,   aa. as usual, the gauge parameter  can be found from
the requirement that the complete transformations (3.14) maintain the gauge (3.3), i.e.
from the following equation

solution to the equation for  is found to be

7we use the notation +, , i and +, , i to indicate the killing vectors in target space and

tangent space respectively.

the physical eld:

here and below we use the notation   . to simplify our expressions we use
creation and annihilation operators i, i (2.13) and introduce fock vector for the
physical eld i

the transformation laws of the physical eld can be then cast into the following form

where the spin operator m ab was dened by (2.14) while the operator rab is given by

rab  a b + b a .

(3.16)

the second and last two terms in r.h.s (3.15) are absent in poincare algebra transforma-
tion law. it is these terms that break manifest so(d2) invariance to so(d3) one. note
that the operators m ij and rij form gl(d  2) algebra which has so(d  2) subalgebra
spanned by the spin operator m ij . appearance of rij is not desirable. fortunately, it
turns out that the last two terms in r.h.s of (3.15) can be expressed in terms of square
of m ij . to avoid repetition we will demonstrate this explicitly when we shall consider
arbitrary spin s eld whose particular case is the maxwell spin one eld.

3.3 totally antisymmetric elds. light cone form of equations

of motion

the next useful toy model is totally antisymmetric eld a1...s. as before we prefer to
use tangent space eld a1...as dened by (2.10). here from the very beginning we start

10

with the generating function (2.11) and use the anticommuting oscillators (2.12). an
appropriate generating function for the eld strength is given by

where the notation is given in (2.14), (2.15). the gauge transformation in terms of
generating function |i take the form

|fi = d|i ,

(3.17)
the fact that |fi is indeed invariant with respect of these transformations can be easily
seen from the relation (d)2 = 0. in terms of |fi the equations of motion take the form
(3.18)

gt|i = d|i .

d|fi = 0 .

making use of relations

d =    d z + z ,
we transform the equations of motion (3.18) to the following form

d =    z ,

(   + (s + 1  d) z)(   sz)|i = 0 .

(3.19)

the invariance with respect to the gauge transformation (3.17) allows us to impose light
cone gauge which in terms of generating functions looks as

by applying + to the equations of motion and taking into account this gauge we get a
constraint which dividing by + can be cast into the form

+|i = 0 .

(3.20)

taking into account the gauge (3.20) we get from this the following constraint

(   + (s + 2  d) z)|i = 0 .

solution to this constraint is given by

(  + + i i + (s + 2  d) z)|i = 0 .

|i = (cid:16)1

where |phi is generating function of physical degrees of freedom, i.e.
on i:

(3.21)

it depends only

|phi = i1...isi1 . . . is|0i .

now by inserting (3.21) into equations of motion (3.19) we get the following equations
of motion for physical eld |phi

(z22 + (2  d)zz + (d  2s  2)z z + s(d  s  1))|phi = 0 .

(3.22)

11

we wish to express oscillator part of these equitations in terms of spin operator m ij
alone. by using the representation (2.14) we get

m 2

m 2

ij|phi = 2s(d  2  s)|phi ,

where

m 2

ij  m ij m ij .

with the help of these relationships we can cast the equations of motion (3.22) into the
following form

(z22 + (2  d)zz +
note that m 2
ij are nothing but the second order casimir operator of the so(d3)
and so(d  2) algebras respectively. the fact that we can cast our equations into this
form we consider as one of interesting results of this work. in order to cancel zz term
we make the rescaling

(3.26)

sl.c. = z ddxh+|( + p )|i .

it is instructive to demonstrate how do the results of this section reproduce the ones
for the spin one maxwell eld. spin one vector eld i, which transforms in vector
representation of so(d  2) algebra, is decomposed into vector representation i and
scalar representation  of so(d  3) algebra. for both these components the casimir
operator of so(d  2) algebra m 2

ij takes the same values8

8here we use the fact that for totally antisymmetric spin s representation of so(n ) algebra the

casimir operator m 2

ij takes the value m 2

ij|i = 2s(n  s)|i.

m 2

ij|i = 2(d  3)|i ,

|i = |1i + |0i ,

while the casimir operator of so(d  3) subalgebra m 2

ij|1i = 2(d  4)|1i ,

|1i = ii|0i ,
ij gives

ij|0i = 0 .

|0i = z|0i

now it is straightforward to see that the formulas for spin one (3.9),(3.10) are indeed
reproduced.

3.4 light cone form of transformations of totally antisymmet-

ric eld

now we are studying transformation laws of physical degrees of freedom collected in |i.
as in the case spin one eld we start with original global ads symmetries, supplemented
by compensating gauge transformation required to maintain the gauge. the original
global ads transformations in terms of target space tensor eld are given by

isoma1...s = la1...s ,

(3.27)

where the action of lie derivative l is given by
xk=1

la1...s = a1...s

killing vectors a (3.13) these transformations take the form

(3.28)

(3.29)

now let us focus on the original ads algebra transformations supplemented with gauge
transformation

(3.30)
our aim in is to get transformation laws for the physical eld |i whose relationship to
the gauge eld |i is described by (3.21) (3.23). first we have to nd appropriate |i.
to this end we consider transformation for the gauge eld (3.30)

tot|i = l|i + d|i .

tot|i = (  +

which is amount to the requirement the complete transformations (3.30) maintain the
gauge (3.20) we nd the equation

+tot|i = 0 ,

(3.32)

which obviously has the following solution

+i i|i + ( + + z +  d +)|i = 0 ,

|i = 

+i
+ i|i .

(3.33)

note that this solution is xed by module the term d|fi. because this term does
obviously not contribute to transformation of |i we interested in we can ignore it.
second let us note that in light cone gauge the physical eld |phi is a coecient
(+)0 in |i. due to that in order to nd contribution to tot|phi it is sucient to
analyse ()0 terms in (3.30). the light cone gauge and the requirement (3.32) which
is already satised tell us that the terms proportional to  are absent in both sides of
(3.30). therefore we can restring our attention to (+)0 terms in (3.30). in this way we
get the following extremely useful formula for lie derivative of physical eld

l|phi = (  +

1
2

ij m ij +

where equality + = 0 indicates that we consider only (+)0 terms. the last term in
(3.34) can immediately be evaluated by using (3.21)

im zi)|phi  +ii( |i)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)+=0

(3.34)

thus transformations of physical eld are given by

|i = (

(3.35)

from (3.33) and (3.21) we get immediately

tot|phi = l|phi + (i i  (s  1)z)|i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)+=0

.

(3.36)

|i|+=0 = 

+i
+ i|phi .

inserting this into (3.36) and taking into account (3.34),(3.35) we get the following

(3.37)
note that for spin one this expression reduces to the one in (3.15). as before one has term
proportional to rzi. now let us demonstrate that this terms can be entirely expressed
in terms of the spin operator m ij . indeed making of the following relationships

{m zj, m ji} = (d  2  2j j)rzi + 2i

it is straightforward to see that the transformation (3.37) can be cast into the following

(3.38)

this remarkable formula demonstrates that the light cone transformations of physical
elds are indeed expressible in terms of the spin operator m ij . note that poincare algebra
transformations involve only terms linear in m ij . the presence of the term quadratic
in m ij is an essential feature of the ads algebra transformations. at the same time
the ads transformations do not involve higher than second order terms in m ij . this
implies, at least, that light cone formalism in ads spacetime should not be much more
complicated than the one in minkowski spacetime. with this optimistic conclusion let
us proceed to the totally symmetric elds.

3.5 totally symmetric elds in ads spacetime. gauge invari-

ant equations of motion

the case of totally symmetric elds is the most interesting one because of the following
reasons. one is that the graviton falls into this representation. another is that in four
dimensional ads spacetime all massless physical elds are described by totally symmetric
elds. some time ago completely self consistent interacting equations of motion for such
elds have been discovered [34]. therefore, before proceeding to the general light cone
case it is reasonable to study the totally symmetric elds in their own right. note that
we consider, as before, an arbitrary d-dimensional ads spacetime. the starting point
in our derivation of light cone equations of motion are the gauge invariant equations
of motion.9 some details of derivation of these equations of motion can be found in

9gauge invariant action in d = 4 ads spacetime for integer spin eld has been established in [38]
while for half integer spin in [39]. we do not rely on these results because we need equations of motion
for arbitrary spacetime dimension. for arbitrary spacetime dimension the gauge invariant action for
massless eld has been found in ([40],[41]). there the action has been constructed in terms of linear
eld strength and the reason because we do not use these results is that it is quite dicult to transform
the equations of motion to the ones for gauge elds. the equations for arbitrary spacetime dimension
in terms of gauge elds have been found in ([42]-[44]) but there these equations have been formulated
in lorentz gauge for gauge elds. however as we already demonstrated in light cone gauge the lorentz
constraint does not follow from the ads gauge invariant equations of motion. thus for the purposes of
this work we need to derive the equations in question from the very beginning.

15

appendix a. let us present the result.

we formulate our equations of motion in terms of the generating function |i dened
by (2.11) where a1...as is totally symmetric tangent space tensor (2.10) while a, a
are commuting oscillators dened by (2.13). the fact that |i is a spin s eld is reected
by constraint

in addition one imposes the double traceless condition

|i = s|i ,   a a .

the gauge invariant equations of motion look then as

( 2)2|i = 0 ,

where the corresponding gauge transformation is

and the gauge parameter eld  is subjected to usual traceless condition

|i = d|i

the above equations of motion can equivalently be rewritten in the form

2|i = 0 .

which is more convenient in practical calculations. the formulation in terms of double
traceless eld is not convenient for our purposes. as is well known the double traceless
spin s eld can be decomposed into spin s traceless eld the one of spin s  2:

|i = |si + 2|s2i ,

where the elds |si and |s2i satisfy the usual traceless condition

inverse relations to the decomposition (3.43) are

2|si = 0 ,

2|s2i = 0 .

(3.43)

(3.44)

|si = (1 

2 2

2(2s + d  4)

)|i ,

2(2s + d  4)|s2i = 2|i .

in terms of these new elds the equations of motion (3.42) take the form

16

a + aabdb  d d  s2 + (6  d)s + 2d  6(cid:17)|si

(cid:16)d2
+2(cid:16)d2
+(2s + d  6)(d)2|s2i = 0 .

(3.45)

this form turns out to be more convenient for deriving light cone form of equations of
motion. gauge transformation for |si looks as
2

(3.46)

|si = (cid:16)d 

2s + d  4

d(cid:17)|i .

gauge transformation for the eld |s2i can be obtained straightforwardly from the
formulas above but we do not need them because in light cone gauge the constraints
produced by equations of motion set the eld |s2i to be equal zero.

3.6 totally symmetric elds. light cone form of equations of

motion

taking into account that the gauge eld |si and the gauge parameter eld |i have the
same number degrees of freedom and due to invariance with respect to gauge transfor-
mation (3.46) we can impose the light cone gauge

note that in this gauge we get from (3.44) the constraint

+|si = 0 .

(3.47)

(3.48)
i.e. |si becomes traceless eld with respect to transverse indices. acting with +2 on
the equations of motion (3.45) one proves that |s2i = 0. then by acting + on the
equations of motion we get the lorentz like constraint

2
i|si = 0 ,

dividing both the sides by + this constraint can be cast into form

d|si = 

2( +  + z)
+  2+ z

z|si .

|si = (cid:16)

solution to this equation is found to be

(3.49)

(3.50)

the generating function |phi consists of only physical degrees of freedom

and due to (3.48) fulll the traceless condition

|phi = i1...isi1 . . . is|0i

2
i|phi = 0 ,

(3.51)
which tells us that the eld |phi has the number of spin degrees of freedom equal to
dimension of symmetric spin s irreducible representation of so(d  2) algebra. it is the
eld phi that describes physical degrees of freedom. now we have to insert solution for
|si (3.50) into equations of motion (3.45). taking into account that |s2i = 0 and
rewriting the equations of motion (3.45) explicitly in poincare coordinates we get

(cid:16)( a  a z)2 + (2z  d) d + (1  d)( z  z z)  s2 + (5  d)s + 2d  6(cid:17)|si = 0 .
inserting the solution (3.50) in this equation we nd after some tedious but straightfor-
ward calculations the following equations of motion for the physical eld |phi

(cid:16) 2 + (1  d) z + (2s + d  6)z z  i2 z2  s2 + (5  d)s + 2d  6(cid:17)|phi = 0 .

as before we wish to express the oscillator part of these equations in terms of spin
operator m ij alone. taking into account the relation

1
2

m 2

ij = i2 j2  (j j)2 + (5  d)j j

and the traceless condition (3.51) one easily proves the following relationship

1
2

m 2

ij|phi = (cid:16)j2 z2 + (2s + d  6)z z  s2 + (5  d)s(cid:17)|phi .

making use of this relationship we get the following nice representation for the light cone
equations of motion

(cid:16) 2 + (1  d) z +

m 2

ij + 2d  6(cid:17)|phi = 0 .

finally, in terms of the canonical normalized physical eld |i dened as in (3.23) one
has the following form for equations of motion

for physical totally symmetric eld

(3.53)
by inserting this p  and the eld |i into (3.26) we get immediately the action that
leads to the above light cone equations of motion.

3.7 light cone form of transformations of totally symmetric

eld

in order to nd transformation laws of the physical eld |i we start as before with
the global transformations for the gauge eld |si supplemented with appropriate gauge
transformation

tot|si = l|si + gt|si ,

(3.54)

where the gauge transformation is given by (3.46). the action of lie derivative is given as
before by (3.29), where the anticommuting oscillators should be replaced by commuting
ones. as above the gauge parameter eld |i is found from the equation

+tot|si = 0 .

(3.55)
note that in order to nd tot|phi it is sucient to analyse (+)0 terms in (3.54).
before to solve the equation (3.55) we consider the contributions of global and gauge
transformations in turn. let us rst consider original global ads transformations. to
this end we can use the formula (3.34). the last term in (3.34) can be obtained from
(3.49) and is given by

|si|+=0 = (

i
+ i +

s + d  4

+

z)|phi .

(3.56)

inserting this into (3.34) we get the following contribution of the original global ads
transformations

i j m ij +

im zi + +ii(

now we should nd a contribution of the gauge transformation. to this end we cast the
gauge transformation (3.46) into the form

gt|si = (cid:16)  + (s  1)z 

2

2s + d  4

(   + (s  1) z)(cid:17)|i .

(3.58)

since in r.h.s of this expressions there is the annihilation oscillator  it is clear that in
order to nd contribution of |i into tot|phi we need only the rst two leading terms
in expansion of |i in powers of +:

|i = |0i + +|1i + . . . .
plugging this into (3.58) and taking (+)0 terms we nd

j2

gt|phi = (i i + (s 1)z)|0i
2s + d  4(cid:16)( i i + (s 1) z)|0i + +|1i(cid:17) . (3.59)
all that remains to nd explicit transformation is to nd solution to |i. to this end we
return to the equation (3.55). using there an explicit form of the lie derivative (3.29)
and the gauge transformation (3.46) we get from (3.55) the following equation for |i

19

+i i|si +(cid:16) + 

2+

2s + d  4

(   + (s  1) z)(cid:17)|i = 0 .

(3.60)

note that while deriving this equation we have used the fact that +|i = 0. this
fact can be proved by analysis the requirement +2tot|si = 0 which is consequence of
(3.55). from the equation (3.60) we get immediately

then by acting on (3.60) with  and taking (+)0 terms we obtain the relation

|0i = 

+i
+ i|phi .

(3.61)

+i i |si +(cid:16) +

taking into account (3.56) we get

(  + + i i + (s  1) z)(cid:17)|i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)+=0

= 0 .

( i i + (s  1) z)|0i + +|1i = (2s + d  4)

+i
+ i z|phi .

(3.62)

by plugging (3.61) and (3.62) into (3.59) and taking into account the relation

(i i + (s  1)z)|0i = (cid:16) +j (i i
+ +

we get contribution of the gauge transformation

gt|phi = (cid:16) +j (i i

+ (cid:17)|phi .

by summing this with contribution of the original global ads transformations (3.57) we
get complete transformation laws for the physical led |phi:

this can be rewritten in terms of the canonical normalized physical eld |i (3.23) and

(3.63)

this form of transformations is quite dierent from the analogous expressions for an-
tisymmetric eld (3.37). despite this fact, it turns out that the ads transformations

20

for totally symmetric physical eld can also be entirely expressed in terms of the spin
operator m ij . indeed, making use of the relation

{m zj, m ji} = (2j j + d  6)rzi  2j2 i z  2iz j2 + 2i

z j j

it is straightforward to see that (3.63) can be cast into the form

(3.64)

thus, as before, light cone transformations of physical eld are

i) expressible in terms of the spin operator m ij ;
ii) consist only of the terms linear and quadratic in m ij , i.e. do not involve higher

powers in m ij .

note that the form of transformation for totally symmetric eld (3.64) coincides with
the one for totally antisymmetric eld (3.38). unfortunately, this fact does not imply
that the form of representation given in (3.64) and supplied by appropriate spin operator
m ij is valid for elds of arbitrary symmetry. in this respect the situation diers from the
one for poincare algebra transformations. the reason for this is that the ads algebra
transformations involve term quadratic in m ij . light cone form description of ads
algebra transformation laws for elds of arbitrary symmetry is given in section 5.

3.8 light cone form of generators of ads algebra

making use of the ads transformations given in (3.38) and (3.64) we can represent them
as dierential operators acting on the physical massless eld |i. plugging the killing
vectors (2.7) in transformation laws (3.38) and (3.64) we get corresponding dierential
form of generators. let us present the result.

a =

(d  4)(d  6)

4

in what follows the operator a is referred to as ads mass operator.

few comments are in order.
(i) the ads mass operator a for massless elds does not equal to zero in general. the
operator a is equal to zero only for massless representations which can be realized as
irreducible representations of conformal algebra [45] which for the case of d-dimensional
ads spacetime is the so(d, 2) algebra.

(ii) above representations have been derived by using the oscillator form realization of
the spin operator m ij (see (2.14)). however, having expressed generators in terms of the
spin operator alone we can use arbitrary form of realization for the spin operator m ij .
while exploiting such an arbitrary form of realization one should keep in mind however
that spin operators m ij for totally symmetric and antisymmetric representations satisfy
the following dening constraints

(m 3)[i|j] =

1
2

(m 2 + d2  5d + 8)m ij ,

for case of totally antisymmetric eld and

(m 3)[i|j] = (

1
2

m 2 +

(d  4)(d  5)

2

)m ij

(3.76)

(3.77)

for totally symmetric elds10. these dening constraints can be derived by using os-
cillator form of realization for m ij but they are valid, of course, for arbitrary form of
realization of spin operator.

10we use the notation (m 3)[i|j]  1

2 m ikm klm lj  (i  j).

22

(iii) spin operator for elds of arbitrary representation, say mixed symmetry repre-
sentation, does not satisfy the constraints (3.77), (3.76). in other words the constructed
generators satisfy commutation relations of the ads algebra provided the spin operators
satisfy the dening constraints (3.77), (3.76). therefore the above representation for
generators is valid only for totally symmetric and antisymmetric elds.

(iv) as is well known, in the light cone form the poincare algebra generators are
realized nonlinearly with respect to +, namely, + appears in denominators of some
generators of poincare algebra. from the above expression it is seen that as compared
to poincare algebra generators the ads algebra generators take additional nonlinear
dependence with respect to radial variable z. thus the ads generators are realized non
linearly in two dimensional phase space + (momentum), z (coordinate).11 note that at
the same time the generators are still local in coordinate x and derivative with respect
to z.

(v) if we restore the dependence on cosmological constant  then making use of (2.2)
one can make sure that as cosmological constant tends to zero the light cone generators
of ads algebra become the ones of the poincare algebra.

the above expressions give realization of ads algebra generators as dierential op-
erators acting on physical elds. now let us write down the realization of ads algebra
generators in terms of physical elds. as we mentioned above the kinematical generators
gkin are realized quadratically in the physical elds while the dynamical gdyn are realized
non-linearly. at a quadratical level both gkin and gdyn have the following representation

g = z dxdd2xh+|g|i ,

where g are the dierential operators given above. the eld |i satises the poisson-
dirac commutation relation

[|(x)i,h(x)| ]|equal x+ = 

1
2+ (x  x)d3(x  x)(z, z) .

with these denitions one has the standard commutation relation

[|i, g] = g|i .

4 general light cone formalism in ads spacetime

in the previous sections we have developed light cone formulation starting with gauge
invariant equations of motion. this strategy is dicult to realize in many cases because
the gauge invariant formulations are not available in general. one of attractive features

11the boost generator j + scales the momentum p+ which is representation of operator + in mo-
mentum space. in string theory in minkowski spacetime this boost is realized as rescaling of string
world sheet coordinate . the world sheet scale transformations associated with virasoro algebra play
dening role in string theory. in ads spacetime in addition to the scaling of p+ there is the scaling
generated by dilatation generator d. this d scales, among others, the coordinate z. one can speculate
that in string theory (and higher spin massless eld theory) in ads spacetime there is an underlying
invariance and thus an innite dimensional algebra related to this scaling.

23

of light cone formalism is that it allows to formulate eld dynamics without knowledge
of covariant formulation. moreover, sometimes a theory formulated within this formal-
ism turns out to be a good starting point for deriving a lorentz covariant formulation.
derivation of covariant formulation of string eld theories is one of the famous exam-
ples of exploiting this strategy (see [10, 11]). the practice we have got while deriving
light cone formulation for particular cases allows us to develop general eld light cone
formalism in ads spacetime. in this section we construct light cone form of ads algebra
generators which are applicable to arbitrary symmetry representations, so called mixed
symmetry representations. we show that these generators can be constructed in terms
of spin operators and ads mass operator. we nd closed dening equations for the ads
mass operator.12

an attractive feature of the representation for generators we nd is that they are valid
(i) for massless and massive elds; (ii) for spin multiplets, i.e. these equations are in prin-
ciple applicable to string theory; (iii) for supersymmetric theories. we also demonstrate
how the light cone description for totally symmetric and antisymmetric elds can be
derived entirely within the light cone formalism without using gauge invariant equations
of motion.

generators described in the previous section have been given for arbitrary value
of evolution parameter x+. as is well known, the generators for arbitrary x+ can be
obtained from the ones at x+ = 0 by using the relation

from this and from commutation relations we learn that the following generators

gx+ = ex+p 

g|x+=0ex+p 

p i ,

p + ,

p  ,

j ij

j i

k 

do not depend on x+ while for the remaining generators one has

j +i = j +i|x+=0 + x+p i ,
k i = k i|x+=0  x+j i ,

d = d|x+=0 + x+p 
j + = j +|x+=0 + x+p 
k + = k +|x+=0 + x+(d + j +)|x+=0 + x+2p  .

thus without loss of generality we can put x+ = 0. below in this section all the gen-
erators are considered for x+ = 0. to develop general light cone we should make an
assumption about form of generators. based on our previous study we make the follow-
ing assumptions.

(i) taking into account that the kinematical generators take the same form for both
symmetric and antisymmetric representations (with appropriate spin operator m ij ) we
suppose that they maintain this form for arbitrary representations

p + = +

note that we do not make assumptions about the form of remaining generators k  and

operators m ij nd the ads mass operator a and the remaining generators j i, k .
below by exploiting only the commutation relations of the ads algebra we demonstrate
that the above assumptions turn out to be sucient to evaluate remaining generators
and get closed dening equations for ads mass operator a.

first of all from computation relations of p  with the kinematical generators given
in (4.1)-(4.8) we conclude that the operator a is independent of spacetime coordinates
xi , x and their derivatives i, +, and commutes with spin operator m ij

[a, m ij] = 0 .

on the other hand because of ads algebra commutation relation [p , j i] = 0 we
conclude that the ads mass operator a should satisfy the following constraint

making use of (4.7) and (4.11) we evaluate then the commutator

2{m zi, a}  [[m zi, a], a] = 0 .

(4.14)

note that this constraint gives denition of operator b in terms of basic operators which
are spin operator m ij and ads mass operator a.

thus we have derived representation for all generators of the ads algebra. one can
in

make sure that remaining commutation relations of the algebra are also satised.
fact, it is sucient to check the commutation relation

all others will then be satised because of jacoby identities. calculating the commutator
in question we get

[j i, j j] = 0 .

[j i, j j] =

2z2+2 (m ija  m zjam zi + m ziam zj +

making use of jacoby identities and dening equations (4.12,4.14) one nds

[[m zi, a], [m zj, a]] = 2m ija  2m ziam zj + 2m zjam zi ,

(4.16)

i.e. the commutation relation (4.15) is satised and there are no additional constraints
on operator a.

let us now summarize the results. kinematical generators for arbitrary represen-
tations of ads algebra are given in (4.1-4.8), while the dynamical generators are given

(iii) satises the dening equations

2{m zi, a}  [[m zi, a], a] = 0 ,
[m zi, [m zj, a]] + {m il, m lj} = 2ijb .

(4.20)

(4.21)

an attractive feature of the representation for generators in (4.17-4.19) as well as dening
equations is that they are valid for massive elds, spin multiplets and supersymmetric
theories.13

thus the general strategy of nding light cone form of generators consists of the
following steps: (i) given spin, or spin multiplet, choose appropriate spin matrix m ij ;
(ii) construct the most general operator a which commutes with m ij; (iii) nd a solution
to constraints (4.20), (4.21).

making use of this representation we can then compute the second order casimir

operator of ads algebra

q =

1
2

j 2
ab + 2k ap a  d(d + 1  d)

and nd that all dependence on the spacetime coordinates (orbital part) drops, i.e. the
casimir operator is entirely determined by the spin operator m ij and ads mass operator
a:

q = a + 2b +

m 2

(4.22)

note that this fact is true for poincare algebra. thus the equations of motion take the
form

d(d  2)

 hqi(cid:17)|i = 0 .

(4.23)

where hqi is eigenvalue of the casimir operator q in certain representation of the ads
algebra.
before proceeding let to show in how manner these results can be used to demonstrate
the fact that a eld in the d dimensional ads spacetime irrespective of its mass can be
interpreted as a eld in (d  1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime with continuous mass
spectrum. toward this end let us rewrite the generators p  and j i as follows

(4.26)

the operator m in (4.24) can be interpreted as mass operator for a eld propagating in
(d  1) dimensional minkowski spacetime while m i is associated with spin operator of
this eld. we shall refer the m as poincare mass operator. to support this interpretation
we should verify that these operators satisfy appropriate commutation relations between
poincare mass operator and spin operator m i [10]. indeed, making use of the dening
equations (4.20) and relationship (4.16) one nds that the operators m and m i satisfy
the following commutation relations

[ m , m i] = 0 ,

[ m i, m j] = m ij m .

these commutation relations coincide with the ones for mass and spin operators (see
[10]). therefore the generators p , j i given in (4.24,(4.25), coincide exactly with ones
for massive eld in (d1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime. thus we have demonstrated
that eld in the d-dimensional ads spacetime can indeed be interpreted as massive eld
in (d1) dimensional spacetime.14 in this matching the ads algebra becomes the algebra
of conformal transformation of boundary minkowski spacetime. the fact that in (d  1)
dimensions the spectrum is continuous follows from the relations

edp 2

a ed = e2p 2
a

(see ([46])). interesting point of our study is that it allows us to demonstrate explicitly
how do the poincare mass and spin operators of massive elds in minkowski spacetime
relate with ads mass and spin operator of elds in ads spacetime (4.26)15.

as a illustration how does the general light cone formalism work let us rederive
the representation of ads algebra for symmetric and antisymmetric elds. note that
in previous section we derived this representation by using gauge invariant equations of
motion. now we start directly with light cone formalism and look for solution to dening
equations (4.12,4.14). toward this end we look for the following form of operator a:

a = am 2

ij + b ,

where a and b arbitrary functions of spin casimir operator m 2
ij . we are going to nd
these a and b by applying the dening equations. the above operator a obviously com-
mutes with m ij. next step is to analyse the dening constraint (4.20). this constraint
takes the following form

14this fact was discussed in literature only for scalar eld. our formalism allows us to demonstrate

this fact explicitly for arbitrary spin elds at the level of generator matching (4.26).

15as a side a remark let us note that this fact might have interesting application to a problem of
interrelation of higher spin massless spin elds living in d = 11 - dimensional ads spacetime, which is
a bulk, and superstring theories living at d = 10 minkowski spacetime, which is a boundary. one can
conjecture that string theory can be interpreted as resulting from some kind of a spontaneous breakdown
of symmetries of higher spin massless eld theory. the problem of continuous mass spectrum could be
solved then by spontaneous breakdown of original global ads symmetries.

(4.27)
kl} + (8a2m 2 + 4a2(n  2)2 + 4b)m zi = 0 .
at this point we should use dening equations for spin operators m ij . by using the
dening equations for spin operator of totally antisymmetric eld (3.76) we express the
rst term in r.h.s. of equation (4.27) in terms of others. from this we get solution

a =

from the second dening equations (4.21) we get the equations

and taking into account (4.28) and (4.29) we get

4aijm 2

zl + (1 + 2a){m il, m lj} = 2ijb

b = m 2
zi

for both cases. these results coincide exactly with the those of the previous sections.
here we derived them in purely algebraic way without using covariant equations of mo-
tion. this derivation is much simpler and demonstrates eciency of light cone approach.
note that in this derivation we used only the dening equations for spin matrices m ij
(3.77),(3.76). this is all what is required to get a light cone description of a specic
elds from general light cone formalism.

5 light cone generators for arbitrary representa-
tions of ads algebra. group theoretic approach

in this section we develop light cone form of ads generators both for massless and
massive elds. to do that we use method of induced representations (for reviews see
[48],[49]). let us briey describe this method. let g be a group and h its subgroup.
the decomposition g = hgx denes gx as coset representative of g/h. in the following
the generators of h and gx are denoted by h and k respectively. to dene induced
representation one introduces a space of functions  subjected to the following condition

where  is a representation of subgroup h

(hgx) = (h)(gx) ,

(h1h2) = (h1)(h2) .

29

(5.1)

(5.2)

now the induced representation tg is dened by

(tg1)(g) = (gg1) .

(5.3)

the condition (5.1) tells that the functions  are dened on coset space. it is convenient
to introduce an unconstrained function  dened by (x) = (gx). in terms of (x) the
formula (5.3) takes then the form

where h(x, g) and xg are dened from a decomposition

(tg1)(x) = (h(x, g1))(xg1) ,

gxg = h(x, g)gxg .

(5.4)

(5.5)

since we are interested in dierential form for generators we consider the formula (5.4)
for innitesimal transformations

we use indices m, n, p to label all generators of algebra gm , while the indices , , 
label generators of subalgebra h. for innitesimal transformations we have

g1 = 1 + m gm ,

  1 .

(xg1) = x + m m  ,
 are killing vectors and h-compensators respectively. they satisfy

h(x, g) = 1 + m m

 h  ,

where m  and m
the relations

p (p ) ,

[(m ), (n )] = f m n
 , (5.6)
where (m )  m x . the x are coordinates of coset space gx. these coordinates
should not be confused with the coordinates x used in previous sections to describe
ads spacetime. useful formula for calculation of killing vectors and h-compensators is

  (n )m

  f 

 = f m n

(m )n

 n

m

(5.7)
using these relations and taking into account tg1 = 1 + m gm we get from (5.4) the
following representation for generators gm in terms dierential operators acting on (x)

x = m gxg1

gxgm g1

x + m

 h  .

gm = m  + m

(5.8)
where spin operators  dened by   (h)|h=1 satisfy the commutation relations
(5.9)
using (5.6) it is easy to demonstrate that the generators gm given in (5.8) satisfy the
commutation relations

[, ] = f 

  ,

 .

in next section we use the basic formulas (5.7) and (5.8) to obtain group theoretic
representation of ads algebra generators.

[gm , gn ] = f m n

5.1

light cone form of generators of ads algebra. group

theoretic representation

to apply the method of induced representations we should x decomposition of ads
algebra into subalgebra h and coset space algebra k. to do that we use iwasawa
decomposition g = hman, where hm is a maximal compact algebra, a is a maximal
abelian algebra in g/hm and n nilpotent algebra in g/hm. the n transforms in
certain representation of a. next, g can be decomposed as g = kanc, where c are
elements of hm which commute with a, while k is the remainder of hm: k = hm/c.
for the case of ads algebra we have

a = d, j + ,

n = p , j i, k , k i ,

c = j ij ,

k = p i, p +, j +i, k +.

(5.10)

(5.11)

the subalgebra h is then g/k, i.e. h = anc and in terms of generators it looks as

h = p , j i, k , k i, d, j +, j ij

(5.12)

for ads algebra the subalgebra h is analog of little group. note that subalgebra h and
coset space generators k can be represented as follows

k = (p +, j +i, k +) + p i ;

h = (cid:16)(p , j i, k ) + k i(cid:17) + (d, j +, j ij)

thus the coset space associated with k is used as carrier of representation, while h is
used as inducing subgroup.

the coset representative gx and coset coordinates we use are given by

gx = g1g2 ,

g1  exp(xp + + vij +i + zk +) ,

g2  exp(xip i) .

(5.13)

the wavefunctions will depend on coordinates xi, vi, x, z, which we refer as group
theoretic coordinates. after certain redenitions the coordinates xi and x will be related
with similar coordinates of eld theoretical approach, while the coordinate z will be
related with z.

first we calculate the coset space generators (5.11) by applying the basic formula
(5.8). for illustration purposes let us present the calculation of coset generators in
details. to apply the formula (5.8) we need killing vectors and h-compensators which
can be obtained from (5.7). to this end we start with the following relation for right
invariant form

dgxg1

x = (dvi  zdxi)j +i + (dx + vidxi)p + + dzk + + p idxi .

from this we get

xgxg1

x = p + ,

vigxg1

x = j +i ,

zgxg1

x = k + ,

xigxg1

x = p i + vip +  zj +i .

31

using then the relations

gxp +g1

x = p + ,
x = k +

x2
j p + + xij +i ,

gxj +ig1

gxp ig1

x = j +i  xip + ,
x = p i + vip +  zj +i ,

and (5.7) we get the killing vectors

j +i,x

= xi ,

while corresponding h-compensators are equal to zero. note that these killing vectors
should not be confused with the ones in (2.7) which describe ads spacetime trans-
formations. making use of these expressions and formula (5.8) we get the following
representation for coset generators k:

p i = xi
p + = x
j +i = xix + vi
k + =

j x + xivi + z

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)

now let us derive the representation for generators of the subalgebra h (5.12).

these operators satisfy, by denition, the same commutation relations as generators of

representation for the generators of the subalgebra h

j + = vivi  xx  zz + j +
d = xixi + xx  zz + d
j ij = xixj  xjxi + vivj  vjvi + j ij

note that explicit expressions for the remaining generators k  and j i can be found
from above expressions for p , k i and commutation relations of the so(d 1, 2) algebra.
the expressions for the generators given in (5.14-5.17) and (5.18-5.22) provide group
theoretic representation for light cone form of the ads algebra generators.

5.2

interrelation between group theoretic and eld theoretic
approaches. solution to dening equations

group theoretic representation for generators is constructed in a basis which diers from
that used in eld theoretic approach. group theoretic representation is given in terms of
coset space coordinates  group theoretic coordinates  dened by the relations (5.13),
while in the eld theoretic approach we used the usual spacetime coordinates. therefore
in order to match these dierent forms we should transform them to the same basis.

we shall transform group theoretic representation to the one of eld theoretic. there
are a number of reasons for that. one reason is that we have formulated dening equa-
tions for generators written in spacetime coordinates. therefore to nd the ads mass
operator and spin operator it is necessary match orbital parts of generators. another
reason why we consider the eld theoretic formulation as the preferable one, which is be-
hind this work, is related to interaction vertices. to nd interaction vertices one imposes
locality condition, which implies that the vertices should be polynomial in derivatives
with respect to transverse spacetime coordinates. in other words, formulation in terms of
spacetime coordinates is preferable because in this form one can apply locality condition
directly. so our aim here is to nd transformation which match orbital part of group
theoretic generators and the eld theoretic ones. after that by comparing spin part we
nd immediately representation for ads mass operator a as well as spin operators m ij .
this representation gives solution to dening equations of the previous section.

before proceeding let us make some simplications. we are interested in irreducible
representation of ads algebra. according to the general theory (see [48],[49]) in order to
get such a representation it is sucient to set spin operators corresponding the nilpotent
algebra n (5.10) equal to zero

for remaining spin operators we use the notation

p 

= j i

= k 

= k i

= 0 .

(5.23)

(5.24)

j +

= + ,

d =  ,

j ij

= mij ,

where the + and  are c-numbers, while spin operator mij satises commutation
relations of so(d  3) algebra

[mij, mkl] = jkmil + 3 terms .

thus we shall use the generators (5.18)-(5.22) with spin operators given in (5.23), (5.24).
before proceeding it is important to understand which group theoretic variable is respon-
sible for spin degrees of freedom. below we show that the spin degrees of freedom are
described by the variable vi together with spin operator mij. to be precise, let us make
the following fourier transform

f (xi, x, z, vi) = z du exp(uv+)f1(xi, x, z, ui) ,

where the f1 is a new wavefunction. in basis of f1 the coordinate vi takes the represen-
tation

33

vi 

ui
+ ,

vi  ui+ .

it turns out that in group theoretic approach it is the new variable ui that is an analog of
oscillators used in eld theoretic approach to describe spin degrees of freedom. remaining
group theoretic variables xi, x, z are related to spacetime coordinates of eld theoretic
approach. let us now describe this interrelation in more detail.

first, we are trying to match coset generators (5.11). it is obvious that the generators
p i and p + already coincide. next step is to match the generators j +i. to do that we
choose instead of the basis f1 the following new f2 basis dened by

f1(xi, x, z, ui) = euxf2(xi, x, z, ui)

taking into account that in this new basis the coordinates take the representation

xi  xi  ui

vi 

1
+ (ui + xi)

vi  ui+

one can make sure that the generator j +i (5.16) takes the desired form given in (4.3).
after that we should match the group theoretic k + (5.17) and the one of eld theoretic.
to do that we choose instead of f2 the following new f3 basis

f2(xi, x, z, ui) = z dz z exp(

1
2

z+(z2 + u2))f3(xi, x, z, ui)

in this new basis the generator j +i is not changed, while the generator k + takes the
desired form of eld theoretic approach given in (4.8). thus at this stage group theoretic
coset generators match with the ones of eld theoretic.

second step is to analyse the group theoretic dilatation generator d (5.19) which in

basis of f3 takes the form

d = xx + x+ + zz + uu + d  1   .

this d consists of unwanted term uu which is absent in d of eld theoretic approach.
to remove this term we choose the basis of f4 which is related to the previous basis f3
as follows

f3(xi, x, z, ui) = f4(xi, x, z,  i) ,

ui 

1
z

 i .

it is straightforward to see that in the basis of f4 the unwanted term uu in d is cancelled
and we get

d = x+ + xi i + d  1  

(5.25)

by now the orbital part of this operator coincides with the one of eld theoretic approach
(4.6). before we match spin part of d let us write down the expressions for the group
theoretic generators j + (5.18) and p  (5.22) in f4 basis

j + = x+ + ,

p  =

where

(5.27)
all that now remains is to nd the basis in which the generators j +, d, p  given in
(5.25), (5.26) take the form of the ones given in (4.5), (4.6) and (4.9). this can be done
by using the following f5 basis

c  d  1  2  2+ .

f4(xi, x, z,  i) = (+)+

z(c+1)/2f5(xi, x, z,  i)

in f5 basis the generators j +, d, p  take precisely the desired form of the eld theoretic
approach given in (4.5), (4.6), (4.9) with the following representation for ads mass
operator a

a = 2

 + ()2 + c +

c2  1

(5.28)

in order to complete our analysis we should evaluate the group theoretic generator k i
(5.21) in the basis of f5. the relatively straightforward calculations gives the desired
form of eld theoretic approach given in (4.7) with the following representation for spin
operators

m ij   i j   j i + mij ,

m zi

(1   2) i +  i(  ) + mij j .

(5.29)

note that in section 4 we have made assumption about form of kinematical generators
(4.1)-(4.8) and dynamical generator p  (4.9). the derivation of this section demon-
strates that this conjectured form is in fact a most general form. one can verify that the
above expressions for ads mass operator (5.28) and spin operator m ij (5.29) satisfy the
dening equations (4.20), (4.21) and give the following representation for the operator
b

(5.30)

thus we have transformed the group theoretic form to the basis where the wavefunction
depends on the spacetime variables xi, z and spin variables  i. in addition wavefunction
transforms in representation of little spin operator mij. in order to understand what kind
of form of realization of spin degrees of freedom we have obtained we should inspect the
spin operator m ij . it is straightforward to see that the representation we derived for
m ij is nothing but the stereographic form of realization of spin degrees of freedom. this
fact is demonstrated in appendix b. in other words, group theoretic approach naturally
leads to the stereographic form of realization of spin degrees of freedom. at the same
time, it turns out that the above representation for operators a, b and m ij can be put
into the form which does not rely on stereographic form of realization of spin degrees of
freedom. to this end we introduce the following operators

pi =  i ,

mij =  i j   j i + mij ,

 2 i +  i(  ) + mij j ,

1

ki = 
d =    ,
35

(5.31)

(5.32)

these operators satisfy commutation relations of so(d  2, 1) algebra

[d, pi] = pi ,

[d, ki] = ki ,

[pi, pj] = 0 ,

[ki, kj] = 0 ,

[pi, mjk] = ijpk  ikpj ,

[ki, mjk] = ijkk  ikkj ,

[pi, kj] = ijd  mij ,

[mij, mkl] = jkmil + 3 terms

the remarkable fact is that the operators a (5.28), b (5.30) and the spin operator m ij
(5.29) are expressible entirely in terms of above operators

coordinates. the second realization given in (5.33), (5.34) is constructed in terms of
generators of so(d  2, 1) and does not related to specic coordinates.

the rst constraint is imposed to get a nite dimensional representation. note that in
representation given in (5.31)-(5.32) these constraints imply that |hi does not depend
on  i. next construct the space

where 2+1 = 0. dimension of the space  coincides with a dimension of the so(d  1)
algebra irreducible representation which is used to describe spin degrees of freedom of
massive eld. therefore the  is appropriate to describe spin degrees of freedom of
massive eld. obviously the space  is invariant under the action of spin operators m ij
and ads mass operator a (see (5.33), (5.34)). however for certain values of c there are
invariant subspaces in . these invariant subspaces describe spin degrees of freedom
of massless elds. in order to understand this fact better it is instructive to consider
examples.

spin one maxwell eld. let us start with the simplests case of spin one maxwell
eld. in this case we have  = 1 and h = 0 17. wavefunction of spin massless eld in
stereographic coordinates is given by

|1i   ii ,

|0i  (1   2)

|i = |1i + |0i

(5.39)
the |1i and |0i transform into one another under the action of spin operator m ij , i.e.
the vector |i transforms in representation of m ij . this vector has d 2 degrees of free-
dom and therefore is appropriate to describe massless spin one eld. for arbitrary c the
ads mass operator a moves the |i out the form given in (5.39). indeed straightforward
calculation gives

a|i = 1|1i + 2|0i  2(d  1 + c)|v i ,

|v i =  ,

where 1 and 2 are certain constants. obviously the vector |v i does not belong to
the invariant subspace of |i given in (5.39). the contribution of |v i can be cancelled
whenever c = 1  d. taking into account (5.27) and (5.37) we nd e0 = d  2 and this
nothing but the lowest energy values for spin one massless eld in d-dimensional ads
spacetime ([42]). thus the value c is xed from the requirement that the |i transforms
into itself under the action of ads mass operator a.
totally antisymmetric spin s eld. in this case we have  = 1 and the weights of
vector |hi are given by h = (1, . . . , 1, 0 . . . , 0) (where the unity occurs s 1 times in this
17in this case the vector |hi in (5.38) is simply constant which we set equal to unity and we use the
so(d  3) algebra spin operator mij = 0. then from (5.38) we get that  = (1, i, 2). dimension of
this  is equal to d  1 which is dimension of massive spin eld |i = 1 + ii + 22. the invariant
shortened subspace appropriate for massless case is then given by (5.39).

is given by the wavefunction18

where

(5.42)

as before the |1i and |0i transform into one another under the action of spin operator
m ij . the vector (5.40) has spin degrees of freedom appropriate to describe totally
antisymmetric massless eld. decomposition (5.40) reects the fact the antisymmetric
rank s tensor of so(d  2) algebra can be decomposed into rank s antisymmetric tensor
of so(d  3) algebra and the ones of rank s  1. let us inspect of action of ads mass
operator on |i. straightforward calculation gives

a|i = 1|1i + 2|0i + 2(2s  1  d  c)|v i ,

|v i = i1...is1i1 . . . is1 .

again the vector |v i does not belong to invariant subspace given in (5.40) and therefore
we should cancel its contribution. to cancel the contribution of |v i we set the coecient
in front of this vector equal to zero and this leads to the solution c = 2s d 1. taking
into account (5.27), (5.37) we get then e0 = d  s  1. this is lowest energy value for
massless totally antisymmetric eld in ads spacetime [42],[43].
totally symmetric spin s eld. above analysis can be immediately extended to arbi-
trary spin s totally symmetric eld. in this case we have  = s and h = 0 and we start
with wavefunction19

where

|i = |si + (1   2)|s1i + . . .

(5.43)

|si   i1 . . .  isi1...is ,

(5.44)
complete expression of |i is given appendix b (see (b.6)). here we exploit rst two
terms in expansion of (b.6), put there  = 1 and use simplied normalization given in
(5.43). the dots in (5.43) indicate the subleading terms which can be read from (b.6).
in this case one has

|s1i   i1 . . .  is1i1...is1

a|i = 1|si + 2(1   2)|s1i + 2(5  4s  d  c)|v i + . . .

where vector |v i is given by

|v i =  i1 . . .  is1i1...is1

18the vector |hi, which is used to construct the space , is given by i1 . . . is1|0i. then the space
 is described by expression (5.38) and is given by  = (kikj|hi, ki|hi,|hi). the ki is given by (5.31)
where we should exploit the following spin operator mij = i j  j i.

19in this case the space  is given by (5.38) where we set  = s, |hi = 1 and mij = 0.

38

because the vector |v i again does not belong to the space of |i given in (5.43) we set
factor in front of |v i equal to zero. this can be achieved by choosing c = 5  d  4s.
then from (5.27), (5.37) we get value of e0

e0 = s + d  3

which is nothing but lowest energy value for totally symmetric massless elds in ads
spacetime [42].

the lowest energy values for massless arbitrary type symmetry representation has

been found in [43] and is given by

e0 =   k  2 + d

where k is determined by the relation  = h1 = . . . hk1 > hk. it is for this value e0
that there is invariant subspace in  appropriate to describe massless elds. because
detailed description of that invariant subspace is too involved, we hope to study it in
future publications.

6 light cone form of conformal eld theory

in this section we present light cone reformulation of (free) conformal eld theory. the
reason for doing this is that we are going to establish ads/cft correspondence between
bulk massless elds and conformal eld theory operators. in the previous sections the
bulk massless elds have been studied within the framework of the light cone formalism.
therefore most adequate form for comparison is the light cone form of conformal eld
theory.

6.1 lorentz covariant form of conformal eld theory

to keep our presentation as simple as possible we restrict our attention to the case
of arbitrary spin totally symmetric operators that have canonical conformal dimension
given below in (6.1)20. in this section we recall main facts of conformal eld theory about
these operators. the reason for this is that we use formulation in terms of generating
functions and the resulting formulas look dierent from the ones that can be found in
the standard literature on this subject (for instance see [47] and reference therein).

in this section the so(d 1, 2) algebra is considered as algebra of conformal transfor-
mations of (d 1)-dimensional minkowski spacetime. we are interested in spin s totally
symmetric conformal operators

that have canonical conformal dimension 21

oa1...as(x)

20we do not discuss lorentz covariant formulation for shadow operators which have conformal dimen-
sion  = 2  s. in appendix c we give directly light cone formulation of such operators.
21the fact that expression in r.h.s of (6.1) is nothing but the lowest energy value of spin s massless
elds propagating in d dimensional ads spacetime has been demonstrated in [42].

39

these operators, by denition, are traceless and divergence free

 = s + d  3

(6.1)

as above to simplify our presentation we consider fock space vector (generating function)

oaaa3...as = 0 ,

xaoaa2...as = 0 .

|ocovi  oa1...asa1 . . . as|0i .

(6.2)

in terms of generating functions the traceless and divergence free conditions take the
following form

a a|ocovi = 0 ,
axa|ocovi = 0 .

(6.3)

(6.4)

realization of conformal algebra generators on the space of operators |ocovi is given by

p a = a
j ab = xab  xba + m ab
d = xaxa + 

k a = 

1
2

x2
ba + xa(xbxb + ) + m abxb

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

where a  abxb and the lorentz spin operator m ab is given by

m ab = a b  b a .

(6.9)
the condition that the conformal operator |ocovi subjected to the constraints (6.3),(6.4)
should have the canonical conformal dimension (6.1) amounts to the requirement that
this operator constitutes a invariant subspace in representation of conformal algebra.
indeed the operator 2
a obviously commutes with all generators of conformal algebra.
operator axa commutes with the generators p a, d and j ab on the space of |ocovi. as
to commutation relation of axa with k a we get

[bxb, k a] = a(  b b  d + 3) + xa bxb + a 2
b .

making use of this and the constraints (6.3), (6.4) we nd

[, k a]|ocovi = a(  s  d + 3)|ocovi .

from this it clear that only for canonical conformal dimension (6.1) the operator |ocovi
constitutes the invariant subspace in representation of conformal algebra.

40

6.2 light cone form of conformal eld theory

our derivation of light cone form of generators of conformal algebra proceeds as follows.
recall that in the bulk the so(d1, 2) algebra was realized on the space of unconstrained
physical elds. on the cft side our operators are subject to the divergence constraint
(6.4). it is reasonable to solve this constraint and formulate boundary conformal theory
also in terms of unconstrained operators. solution to the constraint (6.4) is easily found
to be

|ocov(+, , i)i = exp(cid:16)

+ ( + + ii)(cid:17)|o(, i)i

+

(6.10)

a traceless operator |oi is an unconstrained operator. as compared to the original
operator |ocovi this |oi does not depend on oscillator +. the second step in our
derivation is to choose a new basis in which the generators

p a,

j +i ,

j + ,

k + ,

(6.11)

take form as simple as possible. namely we choose the basis such that the generators
given in (6.11) do not depends on matrix m ab in this new basis. this can be done step
by step. first we choose basis which makes j +i independent of m +i. next we choose
a basis which makes j + independent of m + and nally we choose the basis which
makes k + independent of m ab. details can be found in appendix c. let us present the
nal light cone form of the generators realized on conformal theory operators

p a = a
j +i = x+i  xi+
j + = x+  x+
j ij = xixj  xjxi + m ij

7 light cone form of ads/cft correspondence

after we have derived the light cone formulation for both the bulk elds and the boundary
conformal theory operators we are ready to demonstrate explicitly ads/cft correspon-
dence. euclidean version of this correspondence for various particular cases has been
studied in [50][67]. intertwining operator realization of ads/cft correspondence was
investigated in [68]. for review and complete list of references see [69]. here we study
correspondence for lorentzian signature of ads spacetime. as far as we know, in this
case the correspondence was discussed only for the case of the scalar eld [70]. we es-
tablish correspondence for totally symmetric arbitrary spin massless elds. namely, we
match normalizable modes of solution to bulk equations of motion for massless elds
and conformal operators with canonical conformal dimension. also we make explicit
map between non normalizable modes and shadow elds which are conformal partners
of operators with canonical conformal dimensions.

what is required is to demonstrate that representation of the so(d  1, 2) algebra
on bulk physical elds coincides exactly with one for boundary unconstrained opera-
tors. also, it is necessary to make sure that on both sides one has the same number of
independent spin degrees of freedom.

42

as to spin degrees of freedom, the matching is straightforward. indeed in d - dimen-
sional ads spacetime the massless totally symmetric eld has the following number of
physical spin degrees of freedom

nd.o.f = (2s + d  4)

(s + d  5)!
(d  4)!s!

.

at the same time it is well known that this nd.o.f is nothing but the number of inde-
pendent components of traceless and divergence free operator in (d  1) dimensional
spacetime. thus there is the same number of spin degrees of freedom on the both sides.
now let us make a comparison of generators for bulk elds and boundary operators.
important technical simplication is that it is sucient to make comparison only for
part of algebra spanned by generators

p a ,

j + ,

j +i ,

j ij ,

j i ,

d ,

k +

it is straightforward to see that the remaining generators k  and k i are obtainable
from commutation relations of the so(d  1, 2) algebra. we start with a comparison of
the kinematical generators (2.8). as for the generators

p + ,

p i ,

j +i

they already coincide on both sides (see (3.65),(3.66) (3.69) and (6.12), (6.13)). before
matching generators k + let us consider the dilatation generators d. here we need
explicit form of solution to bulk theory equations of motion. to this end the equations
of motion for totally symmetric elds (3.52) can be rewritten in the form

then we decompose the eld |i, which transforms in representation of so(d2) algebra,
into irreducible representations of so(d  3) subalgebra |si22

because of the relation

in the r.h.s we use the notation |osi since we are going to demonstrate that these
operators are indeed the conformal operators. namely we shall prove that ads trans-
formations for |si lead to conformal theory transformations for |osi23. asymptotic
behavior of the solution above is given by

algebra generators on the bulk elds (3.65)-(3.75) and conformal operators (6.12)-(6.18)
respectively. thus the operators dads and dcf t also match. taking into account the

in the bulk generator p 
ads given above we cannot send the coordinate z to zero. the
point is that the p 
ads consists of second derivative with respect to z. therefore the
operator p 
ads does not commute with z, [p , z]  z, and the r.h.s is not equal on the
representation space of bulk theory. note that the bulk generators are dened on space
of initial data. therefore the fact that we cannot send the coordinate z to zero in the
bulk p  implies that we cannot directly map the initial data of the bulk theory into
the boundary conformal theory operator. the point is that in order to put z equals to
zero in bulk generators we have to replace the representation dened on initial data by
the representation dened on the space of solutions. this implies simply that we should
use the fact that on the space of solutions we have schrodinger equations of motion
p 
ads = . in other words, on the space of solutions we can simply replace p 
ads by


ads and p 
so generators p 
see that the generators j +

using (7.3) and comparing the above expression for j i
cf t given in (6.18) we
conclude that all that remains to do is to match m i
cf t given
in (6.21), (6.22). technically, this is the most dicult point of matching. the fact of
coincidence of the operators m i
cf t we prove by direct calculation. the action of
m i
ads on space of solutions given
in (7.1) we obtain the representation of operator m i
ads in |osi. we should to prove that
this representation of operator m i
ads in |osi coincides with (6.21) (6.22). this fact is
proved in appendix b.
finally, let us write ads/cf t correspondence for bulk symmetric spin s massless
eld and corresponding boundary conformal theory operator. from (7.1) we can read
the following relationship

cf t is given in (6.21), (6.22). by acting with operator m i

the solutions given in (7.1) and (7.6) are independent.

after this the remaining generators can be matched in the same manner as it was done for
normalizable modes. relation between non normalizable solutions and shadow operators
is given by then by the formulas (7.5) where the spin operator  should be replaced by
the one for shadow eld (7.8).

8 conclusions

we have developed the light cone formalism in ads spacetime. in this paper we applied
this formalism to the study of ads/cft correspondence. because the formalism we
presented is algebraic in nature it allows us to treat elds with arbitrary spin on equal
footing. comparison of this formalism with other approaches available in the literature
leads us to the conclusion that this is a very ecient formalism.

the results presented here should have a number of interesting applications and

generalizations, some of which are:

(i) generalization to ads/cft correspondence between arbitrary spin massive elds

and related operators at the boundary;

(ii) generalization to supersymmetry and applications to type iib supergravity in

ads5  s5 background [71] and then to strings in this background;
(iii) extension of light cone formulation of conformal eld theory to the level of opes
and study of light cone form of ads/cft correspondence at the level of correlation
functions;

(iv) application of light cone formalism to the study of the s-matrix along the lines

of [72][76];

(v) applications to interaction vertices for higher massless spin elds in ads space-

time.

in this paper we have discussed ads/cft correspondence between massless arbitrary
spin elds in ads spacetime and conformal arbitrary spin operators at boundary at the
level of free equations of motions. by now it is known that to construct self-consistent
interaction of massless higher spin elds it is necessary to introduce, among other things,
a innite chain of anti-de sitter massless elds which consists of every spin just once [34].
this implies that to maintain ads/cft correspondence for such interaction equations of
motion we should also introduce an innite chain of conformal operators at the boundary.
in this respect it will be interesting to extend the analysis of this paper to the case of
that innite chain of interacting massless elds and corresponding conformal operators.
we strongly believe that the light cone formalism developed in this paper will be

useful for better understanding of strings in ads/rr-charge backgrounds.

note that all abovemenioned commutation relations are valid for spacetime of arbitrary
geometry. due to that these relations might be useful for a number of interesting appli-
cations to gauge invariant equations of motion for totally symmetric elds propagating
in spacetimes of arbitrary geometry. for the case of ads geometry the rieman tensor
satises the relationships

rabcd = acbd + adbc ,

cd = 0 .

with the above algebra of commutators at hand the derivation of the gauge invariant
equations of motion is relatively straightforward. we look for equations of motion of the
form l|i = 0 where l is a polynomial of the second order in d and d and impose the
following conditions. i) operator l commutes with oscillator number operator . ii) on
the space of double traceless tensor the operator l commutes with operator ( 2)2. this
condition amount to the requirement that the equations of motion and double traceless
condition respect each other; from this requirement we learn that the operator l does
not consist of terms ( 2)n, n > 1. iii) operator l commutes with gauge transformation.
this implies that equations of motion should be gauge invariant. since we use gauge
transformation of the form (3.40) we should impose the condition [l, d]|i = 0, where
the gauge parameter transformation |i satises the traceless constraint (3.41). making
use of commutation relation above one can make sure that the unique operator l that
satises these requirement is that given in (3.39)

in the rest of this appendix let us write down some important formulas we use in this

paper. in poincare coordinates the lorentz covariant derivative takes the form

from this we get the following useful representations

da = a + z a  a z

d =   + z  2 z ,

d =   + (2  d) z  z + z 2

a = ( a  a z)2 + 2z d  z2 2 + (d  1)z z  
d2

some other commutation relations in poincare coordinates are

[a, d] = a + z a + a

[a, d2] = 2a

z   2a z ,
z d  2 zda + (d  2)a

[a, d] = a
z z + a

z 2  z a

these commutation relations are useful while studying the constraints that follow from
equations of motion in the light cone gauge.

appendix b various forms of realization of so(d 

2) algebra representations

stereographic form. here we wish to demonstrate that spin operator given in (5.29)
comes from description of so(d  2) algebra representation in stereographic coordinates.
to this end we consider the simplest case of totally symmetric representations. let i1...is
be a totally symmetric traceless tensor eld which realize irreducible representation of
so(d  2) algebra. introduce vector ai and consider a generating function

|i = i1...isai1 . . . ais .
the spin operator in this representation takes the form

(b.1)

48

m ij = aiaj  aj aj .

by denition the |i satises the constraints
aiai|i = s|i ,

(b.2)
the rst constraint tells us that |i is a monomial degree s in ai while the second one
is a traceless condition. stereographic coordinates  i are dened by the relations

2
ai|i = 0 .

where  is a scale parameter. making use of chain rules

ai = 2 i ,

az = (1   2) ,

(b.3)

one can verify that the constraints (b.2) and spin operator m ij take the following form

m ij =  i j   j i ,

(b.4)

(b.5)

the operator  commutes with above spin operators m ij . due to that in expression
for m zi (b.5) we can replace the operator  by its eigenvalue s. after this comparing
the spin operators (b.5) with the ones of group theoretic approach (5.29) we conclude
that the group theoretic approach indeed leads to the stereographic form of realization
of spin degrees of freedom. note that by inserting (b.3) into (b.1) the expression for |i
can be cast into the well known textbook form

simple form. here we wish to describe an form of realization of totally symmetric
so(d2) algebra representation in terms of so(d3) which as compared to stereographic
form does not involve special functions like gegenbauer polynoms and which we did not
nd in standard literature on this subject. this representation turns out to be more
convenient for establishing ads/cft correspondence. as before we focus on symmetric
eld. let i1...is be a totally symmetric traceless tensor eld. consider a generating
function

|i  i1...isi1 . . . is|0i ,

49

which satises the constraint

i i|i = s|i ,

i i|i = 0 .

(b.7)

one can consider the second constraint in (b.7) as the second order dierential equation
with respect to oscillator variable z

( z2 + 2)|(z, i)i = 0 ,
obvious solution to this equation is found to be

2 = i i .

|(z, i)i = cos(z)|s(i)i +

sin(z)



|s1(i)i ,

(b.8)

where |si and |s1i rank s and s1 traceful tensors, i.e. they are reducible representa-
tions of the so(d  3) algebra. the solution (b.8) reects well know fact that symmetric
traceless rank s tensor of so(d  2) algebra can be decomposed into symmetric rank s
and s  1 traceful tensors of so(d  3) algebra. these tensors satisfy the constraints

i i|si = s|si ,

straightforward calculations gives

i i|s1i = (s  1)|s1i ,

z|s,s1i = 0 .

m zi|i = cos(z)(i)|s1i +

sin(z)



( i + i2)|si .

instead of the representation (b.8) we express |i in terms |s,s1i as follows

(b.9)

(b.10)

|i = 


|si
|s1i


 .

then from the (b.9) we get immediately the following representation for spin operator
m zi on the generating function |i

j )  +i ,

m zi = ( i + i 2

the representation of m ij on |i has the usual form
m ij = i j  j i

for comparison with boundary theory it is convenient to exploit the following realiza-
tion of |s,s1i. decompose the reducible generating functions |s,s1i into irreducible

appendix c transformation of conformal theory

generators to light cone form

in this appendix we describe transformations that move the generators given in (6.5)-
(6.8) to the those of light cone form given (6.12)-(6.18). again we start our analysis
with kinematical generators (2.8). first we consider the generators j +i and j +. the
original j +i and j + acting on |ocovi are dened by (6.6). taking into account (6.10)
it is straightforward to see that j +i and j + in |oi basis take the form

j +i = x+i  xi+  i + ,

j + = x+  x+   + .

our rst step is to nd the transformation that cancels out the oscillator terms in the
generator j +i. this is achieved by the following transformation

|oi = exp(i + i
in |oi basis we get the following representation

+ )|oi

j +i = x+i  xi+ ,

j + = x+  x+   + .

(c.1)

(c.2)

because of relations (6.10) and (c.1) the original |oi and |oi are related as follows

|ocovi = exp(
taking into account the formulas

+

+ ( + + ii)) exp(i + i

+ )|oi .

eae b = ea+ b 1

2 ab ,

e aeb = e a+b+ 1

2 ab

this can be rewritten as

|ocovi = e|oi ,

 =

+ +
2+2

 + m +i i
+ .

in order to cancel oscillator term in expression for j + (c.2) we make the transformations

|oi .
the original operator |ocovi (6.2) takes then the form
|ocovi = e(+) +

|oi = (+) +

|oi

thus the representation of generators j +i and j + in |oi basis takes the desired form
given in (6.13) and (6.14). let us now consider the remaining kinematical generator k +.
this generator takes the following form in |oi basis
0 + (   +)x+ +

k + = k +

i +2 .

note that the traceless condition (6.3) takes the following form in |oi basis

52

before to proceed we wish to transform this traceless condition to the form that does
not consist of . to this end we introduce |oivi basis

( 2

i  +2)|oi = 0 .

|oi = 

( +)|oivi .

in the |oivi basis the traceless condition takes desired form

while the generators k +, j i take the form

( 2

i  +2)|oivi = 0 ,

k + = k +

(c.3)

(c.4)

where the spin operator m i is given by

m i  ( i + i +) .

in deriving of last relations the value of  given in (6.1) should be used. finally we
are going to make transformation that moves the spin operator m i and the generator
k + to the form given in (6.21),(6.22) and (6.16). to this end we use the following
decomposition of operator |oivi

|oivi = 


s iiv

|o(1)
s1iiv 

|o(2)

(c.5)

s iiv and |o(2)

where |o(1)
such basis for |oivi the operator m i takes the form

s1iiv are traceful rank s and s  1 tensors of so(d  3) algebra. in

decomposing |o(1,2)

m i = (cid:16)( i + i 2) + i+(cid:17)
s,s1iiv into irreducible components we have
|o(2)
s1iiv = xs

|o(1)
s iiv = xs

(c.6)

s iiv ,

where s takes values given in (b.13) and (b.14) respectively. inserting these expressions
into (c.5) and by applying m i (c.6) to (c.5) we get the following representation of m i
on |o(1,2)

s

1/2m i|o(1)

(c.8)

2s + d  7
53

then the nal basis |o(1,2)
desired form given in (6.21), (6.22), (6.16) is found to be

iiv in which the operator m i and the generator k + take

s

|o(1,2)

s

iiv = 

(si i)|o(1,2)

s

(c.9)

now let us discuss the representation of conformal algebra generators in the space
of shadow operators. to this end it turns out to be convenient to start with the form
of generators given in (c.3). first of all taking into account the relationship (6.1) the
generator k + (c.3) can be rewritten as

k + = k0 + x+ +

+


((  2)( + 3  d) +

1
2

m 2

ij) .

(c.10)

then because of relations

(  2)( + 3  d) = (   2)(  + 3  d) ,

(k +

0 ) = k +

0  (d  1)x+ ,

where  is a conformal dimension of shadow operator  = 2  s we get
((   2)(  + 3  d) +

(k +) =  k + ,

k +  k +

0 + x+ +

+


1
2

m 2

ij) .

from these expressions it is seen that the new generator k + is obtainable from k + (c.10)
by making there the substitution   . this suggests that k + gives rise representation
in the space of shadow operator | oi. additional support to this suggestion is that the
following scalar product

z dd1xh o(x)||o(x)i

is invariant of conformal algebra transformations provided the o is transformed by k +.
by introducing new basis similar to (c.9) one nds the representation of conformal
algebra generators in space of shadow operator. these generators can be obtained from

(6.12)-(6.16) making there the substitution   .
