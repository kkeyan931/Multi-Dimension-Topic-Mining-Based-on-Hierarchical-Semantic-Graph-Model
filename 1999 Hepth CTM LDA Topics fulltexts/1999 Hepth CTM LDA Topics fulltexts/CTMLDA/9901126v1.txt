we analyze the hypermultiplet moduli space describing the universal sector of type iia

theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold. the classical moduli space is described in

terms of the coset su (2, 1)/u (2). the ux quantization condition of the antisymmetric

tensor eld of m-theory implies discrete identications for the scalar elds describing this

four-dimensional quaternionic geometry. non-perturbative corrections of the classical the-

ory are described in terms of a membrane-vebrane instanton action which we construct

herein.

1. introduction

compactications of type iia superstring theory on a calabi-yau threefold results in

a four-dimensional theory with n = 2 supersymmetry. supersymmetry requires that the
moduli space is a product space m = mv mh , where mv corresponds to the moduli
space of vector multiplets and mh corresponds to the moduli space for hypermultiplets.
the vector multiplet moduli space is described in terms of a special kahler manifold that

has been well understood for some time. the hypermultiplet moduli space is described

in terms of a quaternionic geometry [1] whose quantum corrections turn out to be more

dicult to understand, in part because of the complicated structure of these manifolds 1.

quantum corrections to the classical hypermultiplet geometry have been studied in some

cases in the limit where gravity decouples [3] [4]. in this case the geometry is formulated

in terms of hyper-kahler geometry which turns out to be easier to understand.

some time ago it was shown that non-perturbative corrections to the hypermultiplet

geometry of type ii theories can be obtained from membrane and vebrane instantons [5].

the explicit evaluation of some of these corrections was performed in the hyper-kahler

limit in [6] and [7]. in this paper we would like to consider the quantum moduli space

of hypermultiplets without decoupling gravity i.e. the full quaternionic geometry. this

question is of interest since in some cases quantum corrections to the classical geometry

are essentially gravitational in nature so that the hyper-kahler limit becomes trivial.

we shall be interested in the quantum moduli space for the so-called universal sector [8]

which appears in every calabi-yau compactication of type ii theories. in [9] it was shown

that the classical moduli space for the universal hypermultiplet is the coset su (2, 1)/u (2).

a rst step to understand the quantum moduli space for hypermultiplets was done in

[10] [11]. these papers evaluated perturbative corrections to the classical hypermultiplet

moduli space and showed that the moduli space receives a one-loop correction proportional

to the euler number of the internal calabi-yau. this correction originates from the r4-

term of the m-theory action of [12] [13]. furthermore in [10] there appeared a proposal for

the correction to the classical metric to all orders in perturbation theory. the corrected

metric is related to the classical metric by a eld redenition.

in this paper we shall be interested in the explicit form of membrane and vebrane

instanton corrections to the classical geometry. these non-perturbative corrections are

encoded in a membrane-vebrane instanton action whose explicit form we would like to

compute. such an action was calculated in [5] for the special case where the r-r back-

ground vanishes. however, in order to describe the universal sector we are interested in

keeping the r-r elds coming from the eleven-dimensional three-form eld strength, so

that a generalization of the results appearing in [5] is required.

some mathematical aspects of our discussion overlap with a recent paper by o. ganor

[14]. in section two we discuss the classical moduli space for the universal sector in some de-

tail. the coset space su (2, 1)/u (2) describing hypermultiplets has eight isometries which

leave the classical action invariant. the explicit form of these symmetry transformations

was found in [15] and [16]. we will be particularly interested in three peccei-quinn sym-

metries corresponding to shifts in the ns-ns axion and the two r-r three-form potentials.

charge quantization implies discrete identications for these elds. these transformations
form a discrete subgroup z so that the moduli space is m = z/su (2, 1)/u (2). this
discrete subgroup of the peccei-quinn symmetries is preserved in the quantum theory.

associated with the above isometries are a number of conserved noether charges. the in-

stanton action is expressed in terms of an invariant combination of three noether charges.

in section three we construct the membrane-vebrane instanton action explicitly.

2. classical moduli space and discrete identications

let us start by considering the classical moduli space for the universal sector.

2.1. eleven dimensions

the bosonic part of the eleven-dimensional supergravity action is2 [17]:

s11 =

1
22

11 z d11xpg r 

1
42

11 z (cid:20) f4   f4 

1
3

a3  f4  f4(cid:21) ,

(2.1)

2 our signature is (

, +, +, . . . , +).

2

where a3 is the three-form potential, f4 = d a3 is the four-form eld strength, 11

is the eleven-dimensional gravitational coupling constant and the hat denotes eleven-

dimensional quantities. the eld strength obeys the bianchi identity

d f4 = 0,

and the eld equation

d  f4 +

1
2

f 2

4 = d(cid:18) f4 +

1
2

a3  f4(cid:19) = 0.

(2.2)

(2.3)

equations (2.2) and (2.3) give rise to two classically conserved charges (see e.g. [18] and

[19]). the electric charge or page charge 3

qe =

1

211z s 7(cid:18) f4 +

1
2

a3  f4(cid:19) ,

(2.4)

follows from the equation of motion for f4 and is the charge associated to the membrane.

here s 7 is a seven-sphere surrounding the membrane. the magnetic charge or topological

charge

qm =

1

211z s 4

f4,

(2.5)

is the charge associated to the vebrane. here s 4 is an asymptotic four-sphere surrounding

the vebrane. the electric and magnetic charges obey the dirac quantization condition

(see [20] and references therein)

qeqm = 2zz.

(2.6)

these charges can be expressed in terms of the membrane and vebrane tensions,

which are functions of 11[21] [22]. to see this we need the form of the worldvolume action

for the membrane in eleven dimensions. it is given by

sm = t2z d3h 

+

1
2
1
3!


ijix m jx n gm n +
ijkix m jx n kx p am np (x)i,

1
2

(2.7)

3 we will be following the conventions of [20].

3

where i (with i = 1, 2, 3) are the worldvolume coordinates, ij is the worldvolume metric,

x m (i) with m = 0, . . . , 10 describes the bosonic part of the membrane conguration and

t2 is the membrane tension.

demanding the membrane to have a well dened quantum theory, it follows from (2.7)

that a3 has period 2/t2. therefore, f4 is quantized according to:

f4 =

2
t2

zz.

z s 4

(2.8)

the consistency of the a3 periods with the supergravity action (2.1) gives a relation

between 11 and t2

22
11t 3
2

2

= zz.

(2.9)

this relation has been derived in the appendix of [23].

the dual seven-form  f4 couples to the worldvolume of the eleven-dimensional ve-
brane. demanding the vebrane action to describe a well dened quantum theory gives a

quantization conditions for the electric charge

z s 7(cid:18) f4 +

1
2

a3  f4(cid:19) =

2
t5

zz.

inserting (2.8) and (2.10) in the dirac quantization condition (2.6) one gets:

22

11t2t5 = 2zz.

(2.10)

(2.11)

using (2.11) and (2.9) one obtains a relation between membrane and vebrane tensions

which was rst derived by schwarz [24]

t5 =

1
2

t 2
2 ,

(2.12)

using duality arguments. the expressions (2.9) and (2.12) imply that membrane and

vebrane tensions can both be expressed in terms of the eleven-dimensional gravitational

coupling constant 11.

due to the charge quantization conditions (2.8) and (2.10) the moduli space of the

four-dimensional theory will have a set of discrete identications or periodicities in the dual

4

scalar elds as we will see later on. to nish this section we would like to remark that equa-

tion (2.3) can be interpreted as the bianchi identity of the eleven-dimensional vebrane.

as was argued in [21] this equation will, in general, receive gravitational chern-simons

corrections associated with the sigma-model anomaly on the six-dimensional vebrane

worldvolume. the corrected vebrane bianchi identity contains a term proportional to

x8, which is an eight-form polynomial quartic in the gravitational curvature. this will

give a gravitational contribution to the quantization condition of the electic charge (2.4).

we will not take this eect into account in the following. the existence of gravitational

contributions to the ux quantization law for the antisymmetric tensor eld of m-theory

was rst pointed out in [25].

2.2. ten dimensions

to reduce the action (2.1) to ten dimensions we make the following ansatz for the

metric (see [26] and references therein)

ds2

11 = e2/3gmndxmdxn + e4/3(dx11  amdxm)2,

(2.13)

where m, n = 1, . . . 10 are ten-dimensional indices and  is the ten-dimensional dilaton. in

the following we will not take the dependence on the type iia gauge eld am into account

as this eld contributes to the four-dimensional vectormultiplet moduli space. we will

be using conventions where the range of the eleventh dimension is x11  x11 + 2
11/ = (2)7 4. in order to obtain a canonical einstein term in ten
dimensions it is convenient to use the weyl rescaling formula (valid in any dimension d).

and 22

10 = 2

under a rescaling of the metric of the form

gac = 2gac,

the scalar curvature term transforms as

(2.14)

(2.15)

2dpg r = ghr  (d  2)(d  1)gac(a log )c log i.

after reducing to d = 10 and weyl rescaling the metric with a factor 2 = e/2 we obtain:

pg r  g(cid:20)r 

1
2

(m)2(cid:21) .

5

(2.16)

from the eleven-dimensional three-form we can dene ten-dimensional gauge eld poten-

tials

bmn = amn11,

amnp = amnp,

(2.17)

and ten-dimensional eld strengths h3 = db2 and f4 = da3. after compactication and

weyl rescaling we get

f4   f4  e/2f4  f4 + eh3  h3.

the topological term is invariant under this rescaling and has the form

a3  f4  f4b2  f4  f4.

to summarize, the ten-dimensional supergravity action takes the form

(2.18)

(2.19)

s10 =

1
22

10 z d10xghr 
10 z b2  f4  f4.

+

1
42

1
2

(m)2i 

1
42

10 z he/2f4  f4 + eh3  h3i

(2.20)

in ten dimensions a string is dual to a vebrane and the membrane is dual to a

fourbrane. the string and the fourbrane are obtained by double dimensional reduction

of the eleven-dimensional membrane and vebrane respectively [27]. the quantization

condition for the vebrane charge follows from (2.8)

h3 =

2
t1

zz,

z s 3

(2.21)

where t1 = 1/2 is the string tension which is related to the eleven-dimensional mem-
brane tension as 2t2 = t1. the charge associated with the dual string follows from
(2.10) and is quantized as

z s 7(cid:18)e  h3 +

1
2

a3  f4(cid:19) =

2
t5

zz,

(2.22)

where s 7 is a seven-sphere surrounding the string. using (2.12) we can express the ve-
brane tension in terms of  as t5 = (2)53. the fourbrane charge is quantized

as

f4 =

2
t2

zz,

z s 4

6

(2.23)

where the membrane tension is t2 = (2)23/2. finally, the dual membrane charge

follows from (2.10)

z s 6(cid:16)e/2  f4 + a3  h3(cid:17) =

2
t4

zz.

(2.24)

the fourbrane tension can be obtained from the eleven-dimensional vebrane tension as
t4 = 2t5 = (2)45/2.

non-perturbative corrections to the four-dimensional universal hypermultiplet appear

when the ten-dimensional type iia membrane wraps a supersymmetric three-cycle and

when the vebrane wraps the six-dimensional calabi-yau manifold. the vebrane charge

(2.21) and the membrane charge (2.24) give rise to four-dimensional noether charges

that are associated to certain isometries in the four-dimensional hypermultiplet moduli

space. due to the above charge quantization conditions a discrete subgroup of the four-

dimensional isometries will be preserved once instanton eects are taken into account. we

will see this in more detail in the following section.

2.3. four dimensions

the complete action resulting from compactication of the type iia theory on a

calabi-yau threefold was computed in [28] [29] [30]. here we will follow the su (3)-invariant

reduction of [31], which was used by ferrara and sabharwal [9] to construct the manifold

describing the universal sector of any calabi-yau compactication of type ii theories.

the number of hypermultiplets in a four-dimensional calabi-yau compactication of the

type iia theory is h21 + 1, while the number of vector multiplets is h11. in the general

case, with arbitrary h11 and h21 the moduli space is given by a sigma model with target

manifold described by the product of a kahler manifold of complex dimension h11 and a

dual quaternionic manifold of complex dimension 2(h21 + 1). compactifying the type iia

theory on a manifold with h21 = 0 yields only one hypermultiplet which is the so called

universal hypermultiplet [8]. the four bosonic elds in this multiplet are the dilaton, the

ns-ns axion and two additional scalars of r-r type. to perform the dimensional reduction

to four dimensions one should keep only the su (3) singlets in the internal indices. we will

make the following ansatz for the metric

ds2

10 = e/2gij dxidxj + e3/2g dxdx,

(2.25)

7

where ,  = 1, . . . , 4 are four-dimensional indices, i, j = 5, . . . , 10 are six-dimensional in-

dices and  = (x). we shall be using complex coordinates to describe the six-dimensional

internal space. we will make an ansatz gi = gi = i, with i,  = 1, 2, 3 for the internal

metric.

the expectation value of the three-form potential is parametrized in terms of a com-

plex r-r scalar c as

aijk = 2cijk.

(2.26)

the remaining elds contributing to the universal hypermultiplet are the ns-ns tensor

eld b with eld strength h3 = db2 and the dilaton . in order to obtain the scalar

manifold describing the four-dimensional quaternionic geometry one has to integrate h3

out. this can be done by adding to the four-dimensional action resulting from compacti-

cation of (2.20) a lagrange multiplier

s4 =

1
22



4 z d4xg(cid:2)r  2()2  2e2|c|2(cid:3)
4 z (cid:20)e4h3  h3  2ih3  c

42



d c  4h3  dd(cid:21) .

(2.27)

here 2

4 = 2

10/(2)6 =  is the four-dimensional gravitational constant. we can

dualize h3 in terms of the pseudoscalar d and the complex eld c as

h3 = e4 (cid:18)2dd + i c



d c(cid:19) .

after integrating h3 out the dual action describing the scalar elds takes the form

s4 = 

1

4 z d4xg"()2 + e2 | c |2 +e4(cid:18)d +

c

2



 c(cid:19)2# .

we can introduce a new complex eld s

s = e2 + 2id + c c.

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

in terms of the complex elds c and s the classical lagrangian (2.29) can be written as

l = 

1
2

4 (cid:0)k,s ss s + k,s cs c + k,c sc s + k,c cc c(cid:1) .

(2.31)

8

here k is the kahler potential, which has the fubini-study form

k = log(s + s  2c c).

notice that e2 = 2ek. the line element is explicitly

ds2

4 = e2k(cid:0)dsd s  2cdsd c  2 cd sdc + 2(s + s)dcd c(cid:1) .

(2.32)

(2.33)

this is a quaternionic manifold of real dimension four corresponding to the coset space

su (2, 1)/u (2) [9]. the explicit form of the eight symmetry transformations which leave

the classical lagrangian invariant was found in [15] and [16]. four classical symmetries

have the form

i
s  s  0s 
4
c  c 
c

3(c 2 

s

) 

i

4(c 2 +

s

).

(2.34)

here the epsilons are real parameters. in particular, 0 parametrizes a scale transformation.

we expect that these symmetries are not preserved in the quantum theory.

the situation is rather dierent for the remaining four symmetries. first, a duality

symmetry exchanges rec and imc. we will later see that this symmetry is present when

instantons are taken into account. furthermore, there are three isometries associated with
constant shifts of the ns-ns axion d and the two r-r scalars c and c [28]

s  s + i + 2( + i)c +  2 + 2,
c  c +   i,

(2.35)

under which the classical lagrangian is invariant. here ,  and  are real paramaters.

the generators of these transformations form a continuos nonabelian group g known as

the heisenberg group. the generators of g obey the commutation relations

[t, t] = [t, t] = 0 and [t, t] = t.

(2.36)

it is expected that a discrete subgroup of these three symmetry transformations remains in

the quantum theory. the reason for this is as follows. associated with the three isometries

9

(2.35) are three classically conserved noether currents. these are

j =

there are three corresponding conserved charges

q,, =z 3  j,,,

(2.37)

(2.38)

where 3 is a three cycle. the charge q corresponds to the vebrane charge (2.21) while

q and q correspond to membrane charges coming from (2.24). there are two membrane

charges because there are two homology classes for three cycles.

a general membrane-vebrane instanton in four dimensions is described by the eu-

clidean continuation of the three charges (q, q, q). the charge quantization conditions

will imply that only a discrete subgroup of the symmetry transformations (2.35) will re-

main once instanton eects are taken into account. the discrete identication for the

pseudoscalar d can be derived from the quantization condition for the electric charge

which follows from (2.22)

d  d +

n
2

+ . . . ,

where n is an integer. the eld s has then the periodicity

s  s + in + . . . .

(2.39)

(2.40)

the periodic identication for the r-r scalar c follows from the quantization condition of

the magnetic charge (2.23)

c  c + n  in,

(2.41)

where n and n are both integers.

to summarize, periodicity in the elds following from r-r charge quantization con-

ditions implies that we must identify under the action of a discrete non-abelian subgroup

z of g

s  s + in + 2(n + in)c + n2
c  c + n  in.

 + n2
,

10

(2.42)

the resulting moduli space is then m = z/su (2, 1)/u (2).

the charges (2.38) are not single valued on the moduli space. under the discrete

identications (2.41) and (2.40) they transform as

q  q q  q + 4nq and q  q  4nq.

(2.43)

this interesting non-abelian structure is due to the presence of the r a3  f4 term in the

eleven-dimensional electric charge (2.4). this structure will enable us to evaluate instanton

eects coming from eleven-dimensional membranes and vebranes using a rather simple

argument, as we shall later see.

the existence of multi-valued charges may sound strange at rst. this type of be-

havior was rst discussed by witten [32] for cp-violating eld theories containg axions

and monopoles. according to witten a magnetic monopole in a theta vacuum becomes

a dyon with an electric charge proportional to theta 4. in the context of string theories

a similar situation was discussed by greene, shapere, vafa and yau in relation to the

stringy cosmic string[34]. here it was noticed that if one followed certain string states

adiabatically around closed loops they would not come back as the same state. invariant

charges can be dened as

q = q

q = q  40q and

q = q  40q.

(2.44)

here we have dened c =  +i and the subindex indicates the value of the eld at innity.

the classical action for the universal sector could in principle receive both perturbative

and non-perturbative corrections in the quantum theory. perturbative corrections have

been discussed in [10] and [11]. these papers showed that the r4-term of the m-theory

action of [12] and [13] gives a one-loop correction to the hypermultiplet metric which is

proportional to the euler number of the internal calabi-yau

 = 2(h11  h21).

(2.45)

furthermore in [10] there appeared a proposal for a perturbative all-orders corrected metric

which is related to the classical metric by a eld redenition. in the following we will discuss

non-perturbative corrections to the classical moduli space of the universal hypermultiplet.

4 a nice discussion on nonabelian vortices can be found in [33].

11

3. non-perturbative corrections

3.1. four-fermi coupling and quaternionic geometry

in the following we would like to compute instanton corrections to the low energy

eective action described by (2.32). recall that in the context of n = 2, d = 4 super-

gravity it was shown in [1] that the 4n scalars of n hypermultiplets describe a quaternionic

geometry with holonomy group sp(n)sp(1) and a non-vanishing sp(1) connection. the

riemann tensor of this geometry can be written in the form

rijkll

ci k

bj = cbrijij + ij rijcb,

(3.1)

where c, b = 1, 2 i, j = 1, . . . , 2n and i, j = 1, . . . , 4n; rijab and rijij are the sp(1) and

sp(n) curvatures respectively and i

aj are covariantly constant functions of the 4n scalars

that satisfy identities similar to those of dirac gamma matrices. the sp(1) connection can

be written in the form

and the sp(n) connection is given by

rijab = 2(cid:0)iaii

jb  jaii
ib(cid:1) ,

(3.2)

(3.3)

rijij = 2(cid:0)iaia

jj  jaia

i k

jarijkl,

ij(cid:1) + al

where rijkl is totally symmetric in its indices and 2 is proportional to the four-

dimensional gravitational constant. in the following we will be computing non-perturbative

corrections to the four-fermi coupling [1]

z d4xg( i j )( kl)rijkl,

(3.4)

where i is the fermionic component of the universal hypermultiplet. as noticed in [5]

this correction implies a non-perturbative correction to the classical metric on the moduli

space by n = 2 supersymmetry.

3.2. membrane-fivebrane instanton action

there are two types of non-perturbative (instanton) corrections to the su (2, 1)/u (2)

geometry described by (2.32). these corrections originate from the ten-dimensional eu-

clidean vebrane wrapping the calabi-yau space and from the ten-dimensional euclidean

12

membrane wrapping a non-trivial calabi-yau three-cycle. the type iia vebrane can be

described in terms of an exact conformal eld theory [35]. the instanton action for the

vebrane was computed in [5] for the special case when the r-r background c vanishes.

to describe a correction to the universal hypermultiplet we are interested in keeping the

r-r scalar c, so that a generalization of the result [5] is in order. let us recapiltulate the

main points of this calculation. closely related are computations appearing in [36] and

the d-instanton calculations of [37]. the basic idea used in [5] to compute the vebrane

instanton action is that the type iia vebrane can be described as a soliton [35]. since

the internal six-dimensional geometry is unaected by the vebrane instanton, we used

standard four-dimensional instanton methods to compute the instanton action.

the vebrane soliton is a solution to the ten-dimensional eld equations which is

asymptotically at in the four transverse directions. we will make the ansatz (2.25) for

the ten-dimensional metric. the relevant terms of the euclidean four-dimensional action

are:

s4 =

1
22

4 z d4xghr + 2()2i +

1
42

4 z e4h3  h3,

or in terms of the dual eld d (2.28):

s4 =

22

4 z d4xghr + 2()2 + 2e4(d)2i.

(3.8)

here y2 =  yy is the distance in the four-dimensional transverse space. if we consider

variations of d that do not vanish on the boundary, we have to add to the action the

boundary term:

in order to make it stationary. here j 

 represents the euclidean continuation of the

(3.9)

current appearing in (2.37) with c = 0. this boundary term plays a similar role as the

-term appearing in conventional yang-mills theories.

taking into account the eld conguration (3.8) as well as the form of the four-

dimensional action (3.5) plus the boundary term, we obtain the instanton action

sinst = q(cid:18) 1

g2
s

+ 2id0(cid:19) = 2ns0,

(3.10)

where gs = e0 and d0 are the asymptotic values of the dilaton and the axion respectively.

consequently, the eld s0 is the value of the eld (2.30) at innity (again for c = 0).

this instanton couples to the charge q as this charge is related to h3 and the

vebrane is a source for h3. from the counting of fermionic zero modes it was shown

in [5] that the above instanton action gives a non-perturbative correction to the coupling

of four dilatinos. by supersymmetry such a correction is related to a non-perturbative
correction of the s  s component of the classical metric on the moduli space. the e1/g2
dependence is typical for ordinary yang-mills instantons.

s

as we had already mentioned, a general membrane-vebrane instanton is characterized

by the three charges (2.38). the charges q and q correspond to membrane charges. the

exponential of the instanton action should be invariant under the discrete identications

(2.41) and (2.40). this constraint together with the result (3.10) for c = 0 uniquely xes

the action for an instanton with charges (q, q, q) as

sinst =

(3.11)

as is by now well known, membrane instantons, as opposed to vebrane instantons, give

e1/gs corrections to the classical action. this is the origin for the dierent gs dependence

for the bulk terms of the action which contain the membrane charges. notice that this
action is invariant under the duality symmetry which exchanges  and . as argued in [5]

the counting of goldstino zero modes in the instanton background tells us that the above

14

action contributes to a correction to the four-fermi interaction which by supersymmetry

is related to a correction of the metric on the moduli space appearing in (2.33). how-

ever, we have not worked out the explicit form of the metric on the moduli space once

these instanton eects have been taken into account. we hope to report on more details

elsewhere.

taking this computation as a guiding principle other more complicated quaternionic

geometries could be understood along the same lines. a more complicated example of

quaternionic geometry was discussed by bodner and cadavid [38] in the context of type iib

compactications. compactifying the type iib theory on a calabi-yau manifold with h11 =

1 and h21 = 0 yields a four dimensional theory described in terms of two hypermultiplets.

the classical moduli space of these hypermultiplets is a quaternionic manifold of real

dimension eight which is the coset space g2,2/so(4). equivalently, by mirror symmetry

this manifold can be obtained by compactifying the type iia theory on a calabi-yau

manifold with h21 = 1. the instanton action describing non-perturbative corrections of

this geometry can be computed with similar methods as we have done in this paper. work

in this direction is in progress [39].

4. conclusion

the universal hypermultiplet is the rst quaternionic manifold appearing in a four-

dimensional calabi-yau compactication whose perturbative and non-perturbative correc-

tions have been understood in some detail. these corrections cannot be evaluated in the

simpler hyper-kahler limit, as is usually done in the literature. this simple but important

example may teach us how to explicitly compute the quantum moduli space of a general

quaternionic geometry. our undertanding of vector multiplet and hypermultiplet moduli

spaces in the context of type ii compactications would then nally be on equal footing.
