we obtain the complete non-linear kaluza-klein ansatz for the reduction of the bosonic

sector of massive type iia supergravity to the romans f (4) gauged supergravity in six

dimensions. the latter arises as a consistent warped s 4 reduction.

the conjectured duality between supergravity on an anti-de sitter (ads) background

and a superconformal eld theory (cft) on its boundary [1, 2, 3, 4] has led to a renewed

interest in the mechanism whereby the relevant gauged supergravities can be obtained by

kaluza-klein reduction from higher dimensions. it has long been known that the maximal

gauged theories in d = 4 and d = 7 can be obtained by reduction of eleven-dimensional

supergravity on s 7 or s 4, and that the maximal gauged theory in d = 5 can be obtained

from an s 5 reduction from type iib supergravity.

in each case, it is believed that the

reduction is consistent, in the sense that the reduction ansatz, with its truncation to the

elds of the supergravity multiplet, satises the higher-dimensional equations of motion

provided that the lower-dimensional equations of motion are satised. this is important

in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, since it implies that massive elds can be

ignored when calculating correlation functions in the conformal eld theory [3].

a long-standing puzzle has been to obtain a higher-dimensional kaluza-klein interpre-

tation for the gauged supergravity theory in six dimensions [5], whose dual description on

its boundary is a ve-dimensional n = 2 superconformal eld theory [6, 7]. it was sug-

gested in [8] that it could be related to the ten-dimensional massive type iia theory [9].
recently, it was shown that the massive iia theory admitted an ads6  s 4 solution, with
a warped-product metric [10]. this was derived as the near-horizon limit of a localised

d4-d8 brane conguration [11].

in this letter we resolve the puzzle, by obtaining the complete non-linear bosonic kaluza-

klein ansatz for the reduction of the massive iia theory on s 4, and showing that it gives

a consistent truncation to the six-dimensional gauged theory. our starting point is the

bosonic lagrangian of massive type iia supergravity [9].

we shall now describe how we can perform a 4-sphere reduction of the massive iia

theory, with a consistent truncation to the elds of gauged n = 1, d = 6 supergravity. the

bosonic elds in this theory comprise the metric, a dilaton, a 2-form potential and a 1-form

potential, together with the gauge potentials of su (2) yang-mills. the bosonic lagrangian

1to be more precise, the s4 here is not really the entire 4-sphere, but rather just the upper hemisphere
of a 4-sphere, viewed as a foliation of 3-spheres [10]. this is because the conformal warp factor (sin )1/12

approaches zero as the latitude coordinate  approaches the equatorial 3-sphere at  = 0, thus dening a

boundary to the 4-manifold.

substituting the ansatze (6) into the equations of motion and bianchi identities (3) for

the form elds and dilaton of the massive type iia theory, we nd that they are satised

provided the six-dimensional elds satisfy the following equations of motion:

2 f i

d(x 4 f(3)) =  1

note that the bianchi identities for f(3) and f(2) are satised identically, whilst that for f(4)

already implies the equations of motion for f(3) and f(2).

evaluating the ten-dimensional einstein equation (4) with the ansatze (6) is a more

exacting task. after doing so, we nd that consistency again requires the equations of
motion for f i

(2) and x given in (11), and in addition it implies the six-dimensional einstein

equation

it is now straightforward to see that the full set of six-dimensional equations of motion (11)

and (12) are precisely those which follow from the lagrangian (5) for n = 1, d = 6 gauged

supergravity.

in our derivation, the consistency of the reduction ansatz is denitively established, since

we have explicitly substituted it into the higher-dimensional equations of motion, and shown

that these equations are satised if and only if the lower-dimensional equations of motion

are satised. this is, by denition, what one means by a consistent kaluza-klein reduction.

the kaluza-klein reduction procedure is sometimes stated instead at the level of the action;

namely, that one would substitute the ansatz into the higher-dimensional action, integrate

over the internal directions, and thereby arrive at an action for the lower-dimensional elds.

of course in such an approach, it would be necessary to construct an independent argument

for why the reduction ansatz was a consistent one. however, there are other reasons also

why substituting the ansatz into the lagrangian might be problematical. to illustrate this,

it is instructive to look at the reduction we have considered in this letter, simplied initially

by restricting the elds to just the metric and the dilaton.

in the gravity-scalar sector, the ansatz for the eld strengths can be rewritten in terms
g3 s4/3 (3 + 2c2 1 x3) (3), as may

of the potentials, since we can then write a(3) = 1
42

be seen from (6). substituting this and the other non-zero ansatze into the ten-dimensional
lagrangian (1) gives l10 = 1

c2(1 + 118s2  2s4)x 12  72s2c4x 16(cid:17) .

(13)

although the r and ()2 terms have a uniform -dependent prefactor, the term w , asso-

ciated with the scalar potential, does not. integration over the internal coordinate  does

not really make sense, since there is a divergence at  = 0. one can make a suitable regu-

larisation and thereby obtain the scalar potential as given in (5), but this is unsatisfactory

since the result is scheme-dependent.2 moreover, when the higher-degree elds of the six-
dimensional theory are included, it is no longer possible to rewrite the ansatz for f(4) in (6)
as an ansatz for a(3). we thus expect in this case that one would not be able to obtain the

six-dimensional lagrangian (5) by substituting the ansatze into the ten-dimensional one.

it should be emphasised, however, that this is not a drawback in the reduction procedure;

rather, it just serves to illustrate that kaluza-klein reduction is in general rather more

subtle than in the simple case of toroidal reduction. the key point is that given a consis-

tent reduction, one has a way of embedding solutions of the lower-dimensional equations of

motion as solutions of the higher-dimensional ones.

an example of such a six-dimensional solution is an ads black hole, supported by a

single component of the su (2) yang-mills elds. we nd that the solution is given by

ds2

where we have, for deniteness, chosen to use the i = 3 component of the yang-mills elds

ai

(1). another example is a supersymmetric domain wall, supported by the scalar potential

[13]. it is straightforward to oxidise these solutions to ten dimensions, using our ansatze (6).

if the parameter  is set to zero in the ads black-hole solution, the six-dimensional metric

2the occurrence of the divergence is associated with the fact that the metric in (6) has the warp factor
(sin )1/12, which vanishes at  = 0. this singular behaviour is an inherent feature of the massive type
, which has no stationary point. (since the dilaton also

iia theory, resulting from the scalar potential e

5

diverges as  aproaches zero, implying a passage to the strong-coupling regime of the type i string theory, the
eective supergravity will in any case receive modications.) an analogous calculation in the s4 reduction of

eleven-dimensional supergravity, where no -dependent warp factor arises, is free from any singular behaviour

[16].

5

becomes simply ads6, and, as we remarked previously, the oxidation to d = 10 gives the

near-horizon limit of the localised d4-d8 brane conguration (in the case k = 0). when

 is instead non-zero, we expect that the ten-dimensional interpretation will be that the

d4-d8 brane system will acquire a rotation, with angular frequency equal to the black-hole

charge, analogous to the cases discussed in [14, 15].

another six-dimensional solution is the non-supersymmetric ads6 [5], corresponding to
the second stationary point x = 31/4 of the potential. it is interesting to note that the

factor  appearing in the metric anstaz (6), which takes the value  = 1 in the x = 1
supersymmetric ads6 solution, now takes the form  = 31/4 (1 + 2 sin2 ), implying a

distortion of the 4-sphere.

to summarise, we have derived the gauged six-dimensional supergravity by performing

a consistent kaluza-klein reduction of massive type iia supergravity.

(for the sake of

simplicity, we concentrated on the full bosonic sector of the theories; the fermionic sector

will be addressed elsewhere.) the metric ansatz describes a warped product of the six-

dimensional spacetime and a 4-sphere. the warp factor depends on the latitude coordinate

of the 4-sphere, viewed as a foliation of 3-spheres. since it vanishes on the equator, the

geometry of the internal space is really the upper hemisphere of the 4-sphere, with the

equator as boundary.

(this is the region where type i string theory becomes strongly

coupled, and on the dual weakly coupled heterotic string theory side a gauge enhancement

takes place.) we presented examples of six-dimensional solutions that can now be re-

interpreted as solutions of the massive iia theory. more generally, our construction opens

the door to the higher-dimensional re-interpretation of any solution of the six-dimensional

theory, including, for example, non-abelian congurations.
