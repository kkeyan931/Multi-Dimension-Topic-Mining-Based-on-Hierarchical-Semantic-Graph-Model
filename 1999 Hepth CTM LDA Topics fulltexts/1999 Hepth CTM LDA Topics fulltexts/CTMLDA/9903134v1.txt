abstract

in this paper we compute the scaling functions of the eective central charges for vari-
ous quantum integrable models in a deep ultraviolet region r  0 using two independent
methods. one is based on the reection amplitudes of the (super-)liouville eld theory
where the scaling functions are given by the conjugate momentum to the zero-modes.
the conjugate momentum is quantized for the sinh-gordon, the bullough-dodd, and the
super sinh-gordon models where the quantization conditions depend on the size r of the
system and the reection amplitudes. the other method is to solve the standard ther-
modynamic bethe ansatz (tba) equations for the integrable models in a perturbative
series of 1/(const.  ln r). the constant factor which is not xed in the lowest order
computations can be identied only when we compare the higher order corrections with
the quantization conditions. numerical tba analysis shows a perfect match for the scal-
ing functions obtained by the rst method. our results show that these two methods
are complementary to each other. while the reection amplitudes are conrmed by the
numerical tba analysis, the analytic structures of the tba equations become clear only
when the reection amplitudes are introduced.

1 introduction

in the study of the two-dimensional quantum eld theories near critical points, perturbed
conformal eld theory (cft) approach has been quite successful [1]. certain perturba-
tions maintain the integrability structures for the models so that one can use the exact
s-matrices and the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) methods to compute various
physical quantities, in particular, the scaling function of the eective central charge as a
function of the size of a system r [2]. in the vicinity of the ultraviolet (uv) xed point,
the scaling functions of various models behave in dierent ways. while most common
behaviour is the power law corrections of r, slow ows due to the 1/(a  ln r)2 correc-
tions have been found for various ane toda eld theories with an unknown constant
a. we show in this paper that to determine the uv behaviour completely one needs an
independent method to compute the scaling function.

the independent method we need has been rst constructed in a remarkable paper
by a. zamolodchikov and al. zamolodchikov [3] where they introduce the reection
amplitude of the liouville eld theory (lft) in terms of the correlation functions of
the exponential operators and their dual elds. with the reection amplitudes explicitly
constructed from the structure constants of the lft, they derived the scaling function of
the shg model as a function of a momentum which is conjugate to the bosonic zero-mode.
considered as an integrable perturbation of the lft, the shg model provides a conning
potential well for the zero-mode so that the conjugate momentum should satisfy certain
quantization condition which relates the momentum with r depending on the details
of the reection amplitudes. numerical analysis shows a perfect agreement between the
two scaling functions, conrming the new method.

our objectives in this paper is to compare the two methods both analytically and
numerically in a deep uv region for the bullough-dodd (bd) model, another integrable
perturbation of the lft and to extend whole formalism to the supersymmetric case.
formalism to study tba equations analytically in the uv region has been rst presented
in [4] for the shg model by changing the nonlinear integral equation into innite order
dierential equation and has been extended to ane toda theories in [5, 6]. however,
these works have considered only leading corrections of order 1/(a ln r)2. according to
our analysis, the real interesting feature arises only when one takes into account higher
order corrections where the quantization conditions found in the reection amplitudes
approach appear in the analysis of the tba equations as a hidden structure.

comparison of these two methods can be used as a tool to check nonperturbative
relations between masses of on-shell particles and dimensional parameters appearing in
the actions. this is because the reection amplitudes dened as o-shell quantities depend
on the dimensional parameters while the tba concerns only the on-shell quantities like the
particle masses. the relation for the shg model in [7] and generalizations to (fractionally)
supersymmetric theories in [8] can be tested against the tba equations.

another interesting point happens when we analyze the supersymmetric sinh-gordon
(sshg) model using the two methods. as a perturbed super-lft, there are two re-
ection amplitudes corresponding to the neveu-schwarz (ns) and ramond (r) sectors,
respectively. being dierent, they generate dierent scaling behaviours. interestingly, the
scaling function for the (r) sector has at most the power law corrections only. while

2

we have well-dened tba equation for the (ns) sector, that for the (r) sector is not
estabilished. we suggest the tba of the (r) sector and provide the justications based
on the behaviour of the reection amplitude.

this paper is organized as follows. we introduce in sect. 2 the reection amplitudes
for the lft and super-lft and show that one can interpret the amplitudes as the
quantum mechanical reection amplitudes of the wave function. as an independent check,
we solve the zero-mode quantum mechanical problem for the super-lft to derive the
reection amplitudes showing that they are consistent with the quoted results. in sect.3
we consider the o-critical integrable models of the shg, the bd and the sshg models
and compute the scaling functions using the reection amplitudes methods along with
the quantization conditions. we perform the analytic computations in sect. 4 for the
various tba equations generalizing the leading order computation upto several higher
orders enough for us to conclude that we can nd nonperturbative equations identical
to the quantization conditions. numerical conrmations of our results are presented in
sect.5 and some relevent discussions are made in sect.6.

2 reection amplitudes

in this section, we introduce the reection amplitudes for the lft and super-lft by
quoting references. we interpret the reection amplitudes as a reection of quantum
mechanical wave functional of zero-modes.

2.1 liouville field theory

the lft has been studied actively due to its relations to 2d quantum gravity and string
theory and been shown that it enjoys all the properties as a cft. the lft action dened
on a large disk  of radius r   is

al =

1

4 zh(a)2 + 4e2bi d2x +

q

r z

dl + 2q2 ln r

where b is the dimensionless liouville coupling constant and the scale parameter  is
usually called the cosmological constant and the background charge q at innity is

the lft is a cft with central charge

q = b + 1/b.

cl = 1 + 6q2

and the dimensions of exponential operators

given by

v(x) = e2(x)

 = (q  ).

3

since vq and v have the same dimension, vq is called the reection image of v
and vice versa. these two operators are dual to each other.

the n-point correlation function of the exponential elds dened as a functional inte-

gral

g1,...,n(x1, . . . , xn) = z v1(x1) . . . vn(xn)eal[]d

can be determined as a formal expansion of the cosmological constant and computed
exactly. the result shows an interesting relation between the correlation functions g1,...,n
and gq1,...,n. as an example, consider the three-point function which can be written
as

g1,2,3(x1, x2, x3) = |x12|23|x23|21|x31|22c(1, 2, 3)

where c(1, 2, 3) is the structure constant and 1 = 1  2  3 and so on. there
are several independent methods to compute the correlation functions; functional integral
[9, 10], the canonical treatment [11], and on-mass-shell condition[3].

the reection   q   of each of the three operators introduces the liouville

reection amplitude sl(p )

c(q  1, 2, 3) = c(1, 2, 3)sl(i1  iq/2)
sl(p ) = (cid:16)(b2)(cid:17)2ip/b (1 + 2ip/b)(1 + 2ip b)
(1  2ip/b)(1  2ip b)

(1)

(2)

where

with

by construction, the reection amplitudes can be also dened from a two-point function

(x) = (x)/(1  x).

hv(z, z)v(0, 0)i =

sl(i  iq/2)

|z|2

with hv(z, z)vq(0, 0)i =

1

|z|2

.

consider lft on a cylinder of circumference 2 with the cartesian coordinates x1, x2
where x2 along the cylinder is dened as the imaginary time and x1  x1 + 2 is the space
coordinate. the hamiltonian acting in the space of states a of lft

h = 

cl
12

+ l0 + l0

generates translations along the time x2. the space of states a is classied in the highest
weight representations of v ir  v ir

a = pap

where a conformal class ap contains a primary state vp  v with

and satises

 =

q
2

+ ip

lnvp = lnvp = 0
l0vp = l0vp = (q2/4 + p 2)vp .

at

n > 0

4

the primary state vp corresponding to the exponential operator v becomes the lowest
energy state and its descendants are generated by the action of ln and ln with n < 0 on
vp . also the terminology of the reection image becomes clear since the operator vq
is represented by the primary state vp . right and left generators ln and ln commute
and therefore ap has the structure of a direct product of right and left modules.
in the lft, one can reformulate the conformal structure in terms of the zero-mode
of the liouville eld (x) dened by

0 = z 2

0

(x)

dx1
2

.

as 0   in the conguration space, one can neglect the exponential interaction term
in the lft action so that one can expand (x) as a free massless eld (z = x1 + ix2)

(x) = 0  p(z  z) + xn6=0(cid:18)ian

where we dened the momentum conjugate to the zero-mode 0 as

and the oscillators satisfy

[am, an] =

the virasoro generators are given by

ln = xk6=0,n
l0 = 2xk>0

akank + (2p + inq)an,
akak + q2/4 + p 2,

n 6= 0

and similarly for lns. the space of states is now represented as

a0 = l2( < 0 < )  f

(3)

(4)

where l2 is the two-dimensional phase space spanned by 0 and its conjugate momentum
p and f is the fock space of the oscillators.
any state s  a can be represented by a wave functional s[(x1)] in the 0  
asymptotic limit. in particular, the wave functional for the primary state vp corresponds
to

vp [(x1)] = (cid:16)e2ip 0 + s(p )e2ip 0(cid:17) |0i

as 0  

(5)

where s(p ) is the reection coecient of the asymptotic wave functional. one can check
that the wave functional of asymptotic form eq.(5) has correct conformal dimension
by acting l0 in eq.(3). the coecient s(p ) should be the reection amplitude sl(p )
introduced earlier since the wave functional vp for the primary state vp should be
sl(p )vp to be consistent with eq.(1) along with
sl(p )sl(p ) = 1.

5

in this framework, one can check the validity of the reection amplitude by taking
semiclassical limit b  0 and using duality. since p is of the order of o(b), one can neglect
the oscillators and keep only the zero-mode 0 so that the hamiltonian is approximated
as

h0 = 

1
12 

1
2

2
2
0

+ 2e2b0.

the exact wave function of 0 for the hamiltonian is well-known whose asymptotic form
as 0   is given by eq.(5) with

s(p ) = (cid:18)

b2 (cid:19)2ip/b  (1 + 2ip/b)
 (1  2ip/b)

.

it is straightforward to check this result is consistent with the non-perturbative reection
amplitude eq.(2) perturbatively.

2.2

super-liouville field theory

now we extend above formalism to the n = 1 super-lft whose lagrangian is given by

(a)2 
with the background charge q

lsl =

(   +  ) + ib2 eb +

2

e2b

the central charge of the super-lft is

q = b + 1/b

csl =

2

(1 + 2q2).

the (ns) primary elds of the super-lft are given by

v(z, z, , ) = (z, z) + (z, z) +  (z, z)    (z, z)

with dimensions

and the (r) elds by

where () is the twist eld with dimension 1/16 so that the dimension of the (r) elds
are

the reection amplitudes of the super-lft dened from the structure constants have
been derived from the structure constants in [13, 14].4 the reection amplitudes for the
(ns) elds are

sn s(p ) =

classical results and tba.

(7)

and for the (r) elds

sr(p ) =   

2

the super-lft is a super-cft which satises the usual super-virasoro algebra. the

space of states for the super-lft can be expressed by

a0 = l2( < 0 < , 0)  f

(8)

where the fermionic zero-mode appears only for the (r) sector and f is the fock space of
bosonic and fermionic oscillators. the zero modes appear in the super-virasora generator
l0 and s0 of the (r) sector in such a way that l0 contains the square of the conjugate
momentum p like eq.(3) and s0 acts non-trivially only on the twist eld.
the primary state vp can be also expressed by a wave functional vp [(x1)] whose
asymptotic form is given similarly as eq.(5). the amplitude s(p ) is either sn s(p ) or
sr(p ) depending on the sector so that the wave functional vp is given by s(p )vp .
one can also check the validity of this expression by taking the classical limit of b  0.
since p is small of order of o(b), one can neglect the oscillator part in eq.(8) and study
only the dynamics of zero-modes. in the (ns) sector, only bosonic zero-mode appears so
that the hamiltonian becomes

h ns
0 = 

1

8   

0!2

+ 22b2e2b0,

which is essentially the same as that of the lft, hence the reection amplitude becomes

sns(p ) = (cid:18)

2 (cid:19) 2i

b p (1 + ip/b)
(1  ip/b)

.

on the other hand, in the (r) sector, additional fermionic zero-mode is introduced in

the hamiltonian by [15]

h r

0 =   

0!2

+ 22b2e2b0 + 2ib20 0eb0.

since the fermionic zero-mode satises

we can represent it by

{0, 0} = 0,

0 = 2
2

0 =

1
2

,

0 =

1
2

1,

0 =

2

2, 0

0 =

2

3,

and the hamiltonian becomes

h r

0 = p 2 + 22b2e2b0  b2eb03 =   h+

0

0 h ! .

7

among two eigen-spinors, the lower energy-state can be obtained as

+(0) =   xhk1/2ip/b(x) + k1/2+ip/b(x)i

0

! ,

x = eb0

where k(x) is the modied bessel function. by taking the asymptotic limit 0  ,
one can nd the non-vanishing component is given by

  eip 0 + sr(p )eip 0

with

sr(p ) = (cid:18)

2 (cid:19) 2i

b p ( 1
( 1

2 + ip/b)
2  ip/b)

.

these are consistent with the exact result eq.(7) in the b  0 limit.

3 scaling functions from quantization conditions

we consider the shg, the bd and the sshg models as integrable perturbations of the lft
and the super-lft and compute the scaling functions by introducing the quantization
conditions for the conjugate momentum in such a way that one can relate the momentum
to the scaling parameter r through the reection amplitudes.

3.1 perturbations of the lft

the shg model
we start by reviewing the analysis of [3] for the shg model or a1 ane toda eld theory
dened rst on a circle of circumference r with periodic boundary condition. by rescaling
the size to 2, one can write the action as

ashg = z dx2z 2

0

4

dx1


2+2b2

(a)2 + (cid:18) r
2(cid:19)

(cid:16)e2b + e2b(cid:17)
 .

(9)

where   [mass]2+2b2 is the dimensional coupling constant with b the coupling constant.
we are interested in the ground state energy e(r) or, more conveniently, the nite-size
eective central charge

ce(r) = 

6r


e(r)

(10)

in the ultraviolet limit r  0. since we are interested in the ground-state energy, only the
zero-mode contribution counts. so the corresponding eective central charge at r  0 is
determined mainly by p
(11)

ce(r) = 1  24p 2 + o(r)

up to power corrections in r.

for the ground state energy, one can consider only the zero-mode dynamics where
the wave functional of 0 is conned in the potential barrier due to the shg interaction

8

term. the shg potential introduces a quantization condition for the momentum p which
depends on the nite size r. as r  0, in particular, the wave functional is conned
in the potential well where the potential vanishes in the most of the region and becomes
nontrivial at 2b0   ln (r/2)2+2b2 near the left and right edges. near these edges of
the potential well, the potential becomes that of the lft and the wave functional will
be reected with the reection amplitude of the lft introduced earlier. therefore, the
quantization condition is given by

(r/2)8ip q s2

l(p ) = 1.

in terms of the reection phase l(p ) dened by

the ground state momentum is qunatized as

sl(p ) = eil(p ),

l(p ) =  + 4p q ln

r
2

.

(12)

thus determined quantized momentum will give the scaling function ce(r) in the uv
region by eq.(11). to see this explcitly, one can expand the reection phase in the odd
powers of p ,

l(p ) = 1(b)p + 3(b)p 3 + 5(b)p 5 + . . .

(13)

where the coecients can be obtained from the reection amplitude eq. (2) as follows:

this model possesses asymmetrical exponential potential terms compared with the
shg model. in the uv limit, the exponential potential becomes negligibly small except
in the region where 0 goes to . this means that the bd model is again eectively
described by the lft. the scaling function of the central charge is given by the same
eqs.(10) and (11) in the shg model.
it is the quantization condition that makes the
dierence from the shg model, due to the asymmetry of the potential well in the left and
right edges. the conjugate momentum p is now quantized by the condition

2(cid:19)4ip (q+q)
(cid:18) r

sl(p )sl(p ) = 1,

where sl(p ) is obtained by substituting b  b/2 for sl(p ) given in eq.(2) and

q = b + 1/b, q = b/2 + 2/b.

using the phase shifts dened as

the quantization condition becomes

sl(p ) = eil(p ),

3.2

the sshg model

now we consider an integrable model obtained as a perturbation of the super-lft, the
sshg model. by rescaling the size to 2, one can express the action of the sshg model
by

.

in the uv limit, the exponential potential becomes negligible except in the region where
0 goes to . this means that the sshg model is eectively described by the super-
lft as r  0. from the ground state energy for the primary state labelled by p , the
eective central charge can be obtained by

ce(r) =

for the (ns) sector, p corresponding to the ground state is determined again by the

quantization condition coming from the super-lft reection amplitudes:

ns(p ) =  + 2qp ln

r

,

(18)

where ns(p ) is the phase factor of (ns) reection amplitudes. this quantization condi-
tion can be solved iteratively by expanding ns(p ) in powers of p ,

in terms of these coecients, one can nd the scaling function in a similar way as eq.(14).
we will consider the (r) sector in the next section since there is a fundamental dier-

ence from the (ns).

4 perturbative tba analysis in the uv region

we compute the scaling functions analytically in the deep uv region by extending the
methods developed in [4, 5, 6] to higher orders. we nd a hidden connection between the
tba and the quantization conditions arising from the reection amplitudes.

since it is hard to get the complete analytic solution on the whole rapidity, we may resort

these equations are iterative in the sense that one can nd the solution for l2n by
inserting the solutions of previous dierential equations, l2k, k = 1, . . . n 1. since these
equations are inhomogenious, the solutions are linear combinations of special solutions
and solutions to the homogeneous equations

2 l2n = e l0 l2n.

the solutions to the homogeneous equation are given by

l2n = c0(1 + x tan x) + c1 tan x,

x = (  ln(r/2)).

the second term c1 should vanish due to the symmetric property of l and the rst term
can be absorbed into l0 by redening constant . therefore, it is enough to consider only
special solutions.

this solution shows some remarkable properties in connection with reection ampli-
tude. first, the relation between  and  in eq. (26) is not changed after this higher order
correction, since it is due to the reection-symmetry property of the solution eq. (25) and
the higher order solutions are given in terms of derivatives of l0. this symmetry rela-
tion has the exact same analogue in the reection amplitude, namely, the quantization
condition eq.(12). indeed, eq. (26) turns out to be the quantization condition once the
integration constants  and  are identied with p and  by

2p q =  ,
(p ) = 2 + 2 ln  =  + 2 ln (r/2) .

by setting the mass m = 1, we will identify r with r.

15

now one immediately notices that  has the role of p and  the phase of the reec-
tion amplitude and  and  have a new nonlinear relation in addition to the symmetry
condition eq. (26),

second, the higher order solution gives null contribution to ce(r) up to this order,

ce(r) = 1 

12
2 22 + o(10)

(29)

independent of the details of the kernel . we need only 0 = 2n+1 = 0 and explicit
values of l(2n)s at  = r: l(2)
0 (r) = 326. so,
eq.(29) becomes exactly eq.(14) since 2 = 2/2q2 in the shg model. the same holds
for the bd model by replacing q with q since 2 = 2/2 q2.

0 (r) = 22, l(4)

0 (r) = 44, l(6)

the fact that higher order corrections vanish upto these orders makes it very plausible
to conjecture that all the corrections indeed vanish so that ce has only the lowest order
contribution:

ce(r) = 1 

12
2 22

and consistent with the quantization condition arising in the reection amplitudes. the
scaling comes in through the relations between  and  only, eqs. (26) and (28). this is
consistent with the reection amplitude consideration.

4.2

the sshg model

the particle specturm of the sshg model is a doublet of mass degenerate which form
a supermultiplet. their s-matrix has been obtained from the yang-baxter equation
[17] which includes one unknown parameter. this parameter has been related to the
coupling constant of the sshg model by interpreting the supermultiplet as bound states
(breathers) of the solitons of the supersymmetric sine-gordon model [18].

since the conventional tba analysis gives the eective central charge in which only
the lowest conformal dimension of the theory enter, the tba equation will give only the
(ns) result. explicit derivation of the (ns) tba based on the non-diagonal s-matrix has
been done in [19] by diagonalizing the transfer matrix using the inversion relation. the
scaling function can be expressed by

ce(r) =

3r

2 z cosh  ln(cid:16)1 + e1()(cid:17) d

where the pseudo-energies are the solution of the tba equation,

1() = r cosh  z d
2() = z d

16

(30)

(31)

where  = b2/(1 + b2) and the kernel is that of the shg model.

analytic computations in the deep uv region can be done similarly. a little compli-

cation arises due to the coupled tba eq. (31). dening

l  lnh1 + e1(ln (r/2),r)i

and

m  lnh1 + e2(ln (r/2),r)i

at plateau (  )

and at the edge (  )

l(r) = m (r) ,

l() = 0 ,
the eective central charge is given as

m () = ln 2 .

r h l  m x 2n( l(2n)  m (2n))i l(1)d

(32)

c0(r) turns out to be the same as the central charge of the shg model. this is because l
vanishes at the edge and l(r) is described by the same tba of the shg model eq. (23).
ck(r) has the dominant contribution from the kink side of l() (non-vanishing part of
l(1)). to express ck in terms of l(r) we need two identities. one is given by integrating
by part and substituting m with l using eq. (32)

where we used the perturbative series results in the shg model. n s is the integration

and quantization condition of the reection amplitude eq. (18),

2n s(n s  ln (r/2)) = 
= 
n s(p)  2qp ln

r
2

we have the relation between the integration constants

n s = qp

2n sn s = n s(p ) + 2qp ln  .

with the help of 2 = 2/(2q2) for the sshg model, the eective central charge is given
by

cn s =

3
2  12p 2 + o(10

n s).

it is not clear how to derive the (r) sector tba directly. instead we can conjecture the
tba equation by considering slightly dierent version of the sshg model.5 by replacing
the cosh super-potential with sinh one, we can still maintain the supersymmetry and
integrability and can still consider the model as an integrable perturbation of the super-
lft. the particle spectrum, however, completely changes. instead of mass degenerate
of a boson and a fermion, we have only left- and right-moving massless fermionic modes
where the boson becomes unstable and decays into two fermions. the s-matrix between
the two modes is the same as the shg model. it is straightforward to write down the
tba equations since the scattering is diagonal. now consider the (r) sector by imposing
anti-periodic boundary condition. following [16] for the ising model, we can nd the tba
of the (r) sector as

1() = r cosh     ln(cid:16)1  e2(cid:17) ()
2() =   ln(cid:16)1  e1(cid:17) () .

the eective central charge becomes

ce(r) =

3r

2 z cosh  ln(cid:16)1  e1()(cid:17) .

at the uv xed point, one can express it in terms of rogers dilogarithmic functions as

where variables

xa = ea(0),

ya = ea()

are solutions of simple algebraic equations

x1 = 1  x2,
y1 = 0,

y2 = 1.

x2 = 1  x1

one can easily check

ce =

6
2 [l(x1) + l(y2)  l(x2)] = 0

using a well-known identity

l(x) + l(1  x) = l(1).

in the uv region, there are only power corrections o(r). to see this, we rewrite the

tba in terms of h = ln (1  e) at the plateau (  r) by
2nh (2n)

ln (1  eh1) = h2 +



2

ln (1  eh2) = h1 +

2nh (2n)

1

.

xn=1
xn=1



for simplicity let us consider above equations with the assumption that h1 = h2 = h.
by solving the leading order equation ln(1  eh ) = h (eh = 1/2), we can nd higher
order corrections around this. the next order correction satises the hooks equation,
2h (2) = 2h, whose general solution is given by h = a sin (  ) with 2 =
2/ 2. now this solution should satisfy the symmetry eq. (25),

2(  ln (r/2)) = (integer)  ,

it is impossible to satisfy this condition with nte  as r  0. therefore, the correction
h should vanish and ce = 0 + o(r). the same conclusion goes with the general case
h1 6= h2.
this result is equivalent to xing the integer n appearing in the quantization condition
to zero. the physical meaning becomes clear if one considers the p  0 limit where
sr(p )  1 comparing with sn s(p )  1. while for the (ns) sector p  2ip 0 so
that the quantum number n should be 1 as in eq.(18), the wave functional for the (r)
sector becomes constant corresponding to n = 0. therefore, the quantization condition
becomes

obvious solution is p = 0 so that

r(p ) = 2qp ln

r
2

.

ce(r) = 0 + o(r).

19

in the b  0 limit, one can verify this from the (r) sector zero-mode dynamics of the
sshg model which is governed by the hamiltonain

h r

0 =   

0!2

+ 422b2 sinh2 b0 + 4ib20 0 cosh b0.

this is a typical supersymmetric quantum mechanics problem and in general there ex-
ists a zero-energy ground-state [20] if the supersymmetry is not broken. explicitly, the
wavefunction of the state is found to be

0(0) =   e2 cosh b0

0

! .

this state is normalizable and its energy is exactly zero. thus at least in b  0 limit, ce
is exactly zero regardless of r without any power correction.

5 numerical analysis

in this section, we solve tba equations numerically and conrm the results in the previous
sections.

first we obtain the scaling function ce(r) of the bd model by solving numerically the
tba equation. then, this result can be used to produce the reection amplitude of lft
through the quantization condition which relates r(= r) and p in the following way. in
r  0 limit, one can neglect the o(r) power correction in eq. (11) and dene p (r) in the
tba framework as

p = s1  ce(r)

24

.

(33)

the reection phase (tba)(p ) from tba is now dened as the quantization condition,
namely,

(tba) =  + 4 qp ln

.

(34)

r
2

according to eq.(11), (tba)(p ) should reproduce the liouville phase (p ) eq.(16) up to
exponentially small corrections in 1/p ,

(p ) = (tba) + o(e 

2p q ).

in table 1, we show the rst three coecients of (tba) in the expansion in powers of
p obtained by numerical analysis of the bd model and compare with the corresponding
(lft) given by eq. (17). we see an excellent agreement which conrms the validity of
our approach.

we have also plotted in fig.1 the scaling function ce(r) obtained from numerical anal-
ysis of tba equations and that from lft reection amplitudes (11), or equivalently, the
full analytic evaluation of tba equation (29) with o(r) power corrections neglected. we
nd that they agree for r  0.1 beyond which o(r) power correction becomes important.

table 1: first three coecients of (tba) in the expansion in powers of p obtained by
numerical analysis of the bd model in comparison with the corresponding (lft) given
by eq.(17).

we can do the similar analysis for the (ns) sector of the sshg model. we dene the

momentum p in tba framework as

p = s 1

12 (cid:18)3

2  ce(r)(cid:19) ,

and (tba) as

(tba)(p ) =  + 2qp ln

r
2

.

table 2 shows the rst three coecients of (tba) in the power expansion in p obtained
by numerical analysis of the sshg model and the corresponding (slft) given by eq. (19)
supplemented with the   m relation (20). here again we see excellent agreements
between the numerical and the analytical results. this result shows that the method
based on the reection amplitudes works perfectly in the presence of fermions like the
sshg model. especially the quantization condition for p holds perfectly even for b
not small for which fermions interact nontrivially with bosons and the validity of the
quantization condition may not be entirely clear at the rst look. thus our numerical
result fully supports the analysis of tba equations in sect. 4 and also the identication
of undetermined constant  as that coming from slft reection amplitude. actually,
from the plot of ce(r) in fig. 1, the approximation ce = 3/2  12p 2 is seen to work for
larger region of r than that in the bd case. the supression of o(r) correction might be
related with the supersymmetric nature of the model.

6 conclusion

in this paper we have analyzed the scaling functions of the shg, the bd and the sshg
models considered as integrable perturbations of the lft and super-lft using the re-
ection amplitudes and conventional tba analysis. our main result is that the new
method based on the reection amplitudes is not only consistent with the tba but also

table 2: first three coecients of (tba) in the expansion in powers of p obtained by
numerical analysis of the sshg model in comparison with the corresponding (slft) given
by eq.(19).

necessary to completely understand the uv behaviour of the tba. as our perturba-
tive computations of the tba show, there are no higher order corrections in the scaling
functions except the leading correction which includes an unknown constant. to x this
constant, one should compare the scaling function obtained by the reection amplitude,
in particular the quantization conditions with the condition that the l function in the
tba analysis be symmetric. indeed, we identied the hidden condition in the tba which
are equivalent to the quantization condition. our analytic results are fully supported by
numerical studies where we have correctly reconstructed the reection amplitudes from
the tba.

in addition, we nd that the uv behaviours of the (ns) and (r) sectors in the sshg
model are quite dierent. the scaling function of the (r) sector has only the power law
perturbative corrections which vanish as b  0.
there are some interesting open problems which can be answered in a similar method
used in this paper. first, our analysis of the shg model, the a(1)
1 ane toda eld theory,
can be extended to those with higher rank by generalizing the one-dimensional quantum
mechanical quantization condition to the higher-dimensional one [21].

second, the new method to compute the scaling functions in terms of the reection
amplitudes can be extended to give the scaling behviour of the central charge of non-
integrable models which can be expressed as perturbations of the lft and super lft.
previously, the scaling functions of the central charges can be computed only when the
models are integrable so that one can use the tba methods.

another problem is to generalize the quantization condition and corresponding quan-
tum mechanical interpretation so that the scaling function obtained in this way makes
sense for the whole range of the scale r. to do this, one may need non-perturbative
expression for the power corrections.

so far we have considered only the bulk integrable models. there has been much
progress recently in the integrable models with boundaries. the main physical quantity
which can be computed using boundary tba is the boundary entropy which can also
ow as the boundary scale varies. using a similar logic presented in this paper, one may
compute the scaling function of the boundary entropy using the reection amplitudes of
the boundary correlation functions for the boundary lft [22].

we hope our approach made in this paper can provide an alternative approach to

compute the scaling functions in the two dimensional quantum eld theories.
