abstract

by making use of the abelian projection method, a dual version of the su(2)-gluodynamics is
derived. after that, the summation over the grand canonical ensemble of the monopole currents,
emerging after abelian projection, is performed directly in the continuum version of the model
in the dilute gas approximation. the resulting dual theory is used for the construction of the
corresponding eective monopole current potential and the string representation. finally, by
virtue of this representation, conning properties of the su(2)-gluodynamics are emphasized.

1 introduction

nowadays, it is commonly argued that the method of abelian projection [1] is one of the most
challengable approaches to the problem of connement in qcd (for a recent review see e.g. [2]).
in particular, a detailed perturbative analysis of the su(2)-qcd within this approach has been
performed [3, 4], and the asymptotic freedom of the resulting eective abelian theory has been
proved. as far as the property of connement in this theory is concerned, it has been argued
in ref. [4, 5] that it occurs via the monopole condensation. this leads to the generation of the
mass term of the dual gauge eld and makes the eective abelian-projected theory of the su(2)-
gluodynamics quite similar to the london limit of the dual abelian higgs model. in the latter
model, connement can be analytically studied by casting the corresponding partition function into
the form of an integral over the world-sheets of the closed abrikosov-nielsen-olesen strings [6]
by making use of the so-called path-integral duality transformation [7, 8, 9, 10]. after that,
performing the derivative expansion [11] of the so-obtained string eective action, one gets as the
rst two terms of this expansion the usual nambu-goto term and the so-called rigidity term [12],
whose coupling constants ensure connement (in the sense of the wilsons area law [13]) and
stability of the abrikosov-nielsen-olesen strings.

the aim of the present letter is to derive the string representation of the eective abelian-
projected theory of the su(2)-gluodynamics (and, as a byproduct, connement) without an ad
hoc assumption on the condensation of monopoles in this theory, i.e. without a reduction of
this theory to the dual abelian higgs model. indeed, the string representation of the monopole
gas [14] can be constructed straightforwardly without introducing an eective higgs eld of the
monopole cooper pairs. this has been done in ref. [15] for the case of 3d compact qed and then
generalized in ref. [16] to the 4d case. in what follows, we shall treat in an analogous manner 4d
abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics, which will enable us to derive its string representation
in a straightforward way. in particular, by performing the summation over the branches of the
multivalued monopole current potential, we shall realize the independence of the wilson loop of
the shape of the surface bounded by its contour. such an approach is the 4d generalization of the
corresponding 3d one investigated in ref. [17]. notice, that within this approach, the dual gauge
eld acquires a mass dynamically, i.e. by virtue of the debye screening in the monopole loop gas.
the appearance of this mass then leads to a nonvanishing string tension and thus connement.
note, that such a mechanism of the mass generation diers from the one of ref. [4], which employed
the cumulant expansion theorem in the bilocal approximation [18]. as a byproduct of the present
letter, we propose a method of a derivation of the sine-gordon theory, describing a 4d dilute
monopole loop gas, which does not exploit the corresponding lattice partition function.

the organization of the letter is as follows. in the next section, we shall briey revisit the
derivation of the eective abelian-projected theory corresponding to the su(2)-gluodynamics.
after that, we shall perform the path-integral summation over the grand canonical ensemble of
monopole loops (emerging after abelian projection) in the dilute gas approximation and arrive
at the eective 4d sine-gordon theory describing this ensemble. in section 3, this theory will be
used for the calculation of the monopole current potential and the derivation of the corresponding
string representation. finally, the latter one will yield us connement in the sense of the wilsons
area law. the resume of the letter is presented in a short summary.

2 eective abelian-projected theory of

the su (2)-
gluodynamics and its reduction to the sine-gordon
theory

let us start with revisiting the derivation of the eective dual model corresponding to the abelian-
projected su(2)-gluodynamics [3, 4, 5]. the action under study reads 1

where f = f i

t i with

sym =

and t i =  i
constant. obviously, one can single out the diagonal part of the eld a as follows,

where a  a3

, a = 1, 2. consequently, one has for the eld strength tensor

a = at 3 + aa

t a  a + c,

where

f  f [a + c] = f [a] + (d [a]  c)  ig [c,c] ,

(2)

(o  o)  oo  oo, and d [a] =   ig [a,] .

next, eq. (2) can be straightforwardly rewritten as follows

f = (f + c) t 3 + sa

t a.

here, f = (  a) and c = gab3aa
 stand for the contributions of diagonal and o-
diagonal components of the gluon eld to the diagonal part of the eld strength tensor, respectively,
 = (cid:16)dab  ab(cid:17)
sa
 =
ab  gab3a. this yields the following decomposition of the action (1)
(cid:17)2
4 z d4x(cid:16)sa
.

is the (formally) o-diagonal part of the eld strength tensor with dab

4 z d4x (f + c)2 +

sym =

however, actually it turns out that the last term on the r.h.s. of eq. (3) contains a structure
which can be completely expressed via the eld strength tensors f and c and therefore should
be referred to the rst term resulting from the diagonal part of the full eld strength tensor f.
in order to extract this structure, let us impose on the o-diagonal components of the gluon
eld the so-called maximal abelian gauge (see e.g. refs. [3, 4]) (  ia) (a1  ia2) = 0, which
can be written as follows dab
 = 0. once being rewritten in this form, this gauge can be
easily recognized as the standard background gauge [19] with the eld a playing the role of the
background. implying such a gauge xing condition for the elds a1
 and making use of
the relations

is concerned, it is worth noting that within the maximal abelian gauge adopted, this term, once
being accounted for, contributes to the momentum dependence of the running coupling constant.
this dependence has been calculated in refs. [3, 4], and the asymptotic freedom at the one-loop
level has been established. namely, the running coupling constant coincides with that of the
original gluodynamics and reads

with c2(g) standing for the casimir operator of the adjoint representation of the group g = su(2)
under consideration, i.e. c2(g) = 2. since in what follows, our aim will be the investigation of the
conning (i.e. infrared) properties of the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics (rather than the
problems of its renormalization, related to the region of asymptotic freedom), we shall disregard
the term (5) as well.

the most important for us term on the r.h.s. of eq. (4) is the very rst one, which yields an
additional contribution to the diagonal part of the action (3). taking it into account, we nally
arrive at the following eective action

clearly, the full derivative term on the r.h.s. of eq. (4) can be now disregarded. as far as the

notice, that the eld strength tensor 2c in eq. (6) plays the role of the eld strength tensor

of magnetic monopoles, whose conserved current is dened via the modied bianchi identities

jm

 = (cid:16) f + 2 c(cid:17) = c

with f = 1
2f. thus, in what follows we shall regard the obtained eective theory (6) as
a u(1) gauge theory with magnetic monopoles. our aim then will be to establish connement
in such a theory in the sense of the wilsons area law [13] and, more generally, to derive the
complete string representation of this theory. to this end, let us rst cast the partition function

under study, z = r daese. to the dual form 2. this can be done by making use of the rst-order

 in eq. (6) by introducing an integration over an auxiliary

formalism, i.e. linearizing the square f 2
antisymmetric tensor eld b as follows

integration over the a-eld leads to the constraint (cid:16)b  2ic(cid:17) = 0, whose resolution yields
b = 2i c + (  b), where b is now the magnetic eld dual to the electric eld a.
substituting this representation for b into eq. (7), we get

it is worth noting, that due to the conservation of the monopole current jm

from now on, b denotes simply (  b).
 , the dual action
standing in the second exponent on the r.h.s. of eq. (8) is invariant under the gauge transforma-
tions b  b + . again, we shall imply that the gauge xing term for the b-eld is included
into the integration measure db. moreover, we shall specify the gauge to be the fock-schwinger
one, i.e. xb(x) = 0.

let us now proceed with the summation over the grand canonical ensemble of the monopole
loops in the dual theory (8). to this end, we rstly make an assumption that the monopole loops
form a dilute gas. as it has been argued in ref. [14], in such a gas (actually, a 3d version of this
gas, where monopoles are point-like particles at rest, rather than loops) only the monopoles with
the minimal charges qagm with qa = 1 are essential, whereas the monopoles with |qa| > 1 tend
to dissociate into the ones with |qa| = 1. here, the magnetic coupling constant gm is related to
the qcd coupling g via the dirac quantization condition ggm = 4n. in what follows, we shall
set in this condition n = 1, which parallels the above restriction to the monopoles possessing the
minimal charge only. the monopole current corresponding to the loop gas then has the form

where n is the number of monopoles, and the closed trajectory of the a-th monopole (which we
refer to as the monopole loop) is parametrized by the vector xa
( ), 0    1. here,
ya
 =
( ) corresponds to its
shape, both of which should be averaged over independently. one can now consider the partition
function (8) with the monopole current (9) as an n-monopole contribution to the grand canonical
partition function of the monopole loop gas. notice, that from now on in this consideration, we
shall disregard the rst exponential factor on the r.h.s. of eq. (8), since its argument becomes
singular for the monopole current (9), and it looks reasonable to assume that (within a given reg-
ularization scheme) all the singularities drop out from the nal expressions for physically relevant
quantities.

obviously, as it becomes clear after integrating over the eld b, the interaction in the monopole
loop gas under consideration is of the coulomb type. due to the debye screening in this gas, the
eld b acquires a nonvanishing (magnetic) mass. in order to demonstrate the mechanism of
its generation, one should perform the summation over the monopole loop gas under study in the
sense of the grand canonical ensemble as follows

continuum version of the corresponding lattice expression) has been used in ref. [16] as a starting
point for the construction of the string representation of the 4d compact qed. in what follows,
we shall proceed with the construction of such a representation for the abelian-projected su(2)-
gluodynamics, but derive it in a more simple way, namely from the representation of the partition
function in terms of the monopole currents. we shall start the next section with the derivation of
this so-called current representation, which is a 4d generalization of the corresponding expression
for the 3d partition function in terms of the monopole densities, investigated in ref. [17].

3 string representation and connement

as it has been discussed above, integrating over the eld b in eq. (8) one gets for the n-monopole
contribution to the grand canonical ensemble an expression in the form of the coulomb interaction
between the monopole currents,

this can be done by noting that its l.h.s. is a vector in the direction , which means that it

then, eq. (16) reduces to the scalar equation sin (|| /(2)) = i|j| /. straightforward

let us now proceed with the string representation of the wilson loop in the monopole loop gas
under consideration. to this end, let us rst properly extend the eld strength tensor, in order
to satisfy bianchi identities modied by the current j. this can be done by adding to f an
antisymmetric tensor eld h (the so-called kalb-ramond eld), which just obeys these identities,
i.e. h = j. notice, that according to the hodge decomposition theorem, the so-constructed
complete eld strength tensor f + h is the most general form of the rank-2 antisymmetric
tensor eld.

by virtue of the stokes theorem, we then obtain for the wilson loop the following expression

we can rewrite the last average on the r.h.s. of eq. (19) directly as

for the oriented element of the hypersurface surrounded by , and for the conserved current j,
r d4xj = r dsj, as it should be.). an apparent -dependence of eq. (20) actually drops out

due to the summation over branches of the multivalued potential (18). this is the essence of the
string representation of the wilson loop in the monopole loop gas.

it is worth remarking, that due to the -function on the r.h.s. of the rst equality of eq. (15),
eq. (20) is equivalent to the average over the grand canonical ensemble of monopoles of the

stands for the gauss linking number of the surface  with the trajectory of the a-th monopole.
this means that connement in the monopole loop gas can be explained in terms of the nontrivial
topological interaction of monopoles with the external electrically charged test particle.

let us now consider the weak-eld limit of the wilson loop, i.e. the limit |j|  , and
investigate the (stable) minimum of the real branch of the potential, i.e. set n = 0 and choose
the upper sign in eq. (18). then, since we have restricted ourselves to the only one branch of the
potential, the -independence of the wilson loop is spoiled. in order to restore it, let us choose
 to be the surface of the minimal area for a given contour c, unambiguously dened by this
contour (see discussion in ref. [17]),  = min. [c]. then the wilson loop takes the form

(23)

where h = h + h + h is the eld strength tensor of the eld h.
it is worth
noting, that the mass of the h-eld following from the quadratic part of the action standing
on the r.h.s. of eq. (23) is equal to the debye mass m of the eld b following from eq. (14).
integration over the kalb-ramond eld h is now straightforward and can be performed along
the lines of ref. [10]. obviously, after such an integration, one gets an interaction between two
world-sheet elements mediated by the propagator of this eld. a certain part of this interaction
can be rewritten by the stokes theorem as the perimeter yukawa type interaction (see ref. [10]
for details), whereas the remaining part, once being expanded in powers of the derivatives w.r.t.
the world-sheet coordinates (which is equivalent to the 1/m-expansion), yields as the rst terms
of this expansion the nambu-goto and rigidity terms, i.e.

law) and the inverse coupling constant of the rigidity term, 1/0, are completely determined via
the parameters of the monopole loop gas and read

c   1/4/. notice, that the string tension is obviously proportional to the square of the debye
mass m of the dual gauge eld b and consequently nonanalytic in the qcd coupling constant g.
this result reects the nonperturbative nature of connement in the eective abelian-projected
theory of the su(2)-gluodynamics, similar to that in the original non-abelian theory. thus,
the obtained string characteristica (positive string tension and negative coupling constant of the
rigidity term) manifest connement and provide us with the necessary condition for the stability
of strings in the obtained eective abelian-projected theory.

4 summary

in the present letter, we have derived the string representation of the eective abelian-projected
theory corresponding to the su(2)-gluodynamics and established connement in this theory in the
sense of the wilsons area law. contrary to the previous approaches, this has been done without
an assumption on the condensation of magnetic monopoles, i.e. without introducing an eective
higgs eld of their cooper pairs. instead of that, we have dealt directly with the (dilute) monopole
loop gas with coulomb interaction and derived the string representation for the wilson loop of a
test quark-antiquark (q q) pair in such a gas. this approach provided us with a natural dynamical
mechanism of generation of a mass of the dual gauge eld, which is due to the debye screening in
the monopole loop gas. we have also argued that connement of a test q q pair in such a gas can
be explained in terms of the nontrivial long-range topological (linking number type) interaction
of monopoles with the wilson loop of the q q pair. besides that, we have illustrated that the
world-sheet independence of the wilson loop is realized by the summation over branches of the
multivalued eective monopole current potential, which is the essence of the string representation.
finally, in the weak-eld limit, we have derived the string tension of the nambu-goto term and
the inverse coupling constant of the rigidity term, which in a manifest way express connement
and signal the stability of strings in the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics. in particular, the
string tension turned out to be nonanalytic in the qcd coupling constant analogously to what is
expected in the original gluodynamics.

clearly, it is now a challenge to apply the approach of this letter to the more realistic case of

su(3)-gluodynamics. work in this direction is now in progress [20].
