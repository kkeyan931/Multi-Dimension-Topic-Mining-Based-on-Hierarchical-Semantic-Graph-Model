(7) metric (6), integrability condition gives a2 = 1, b = 1. moreover, h(z) harmonic function transverse z-direction, i.e., satises h = 0 h 2 = 1/l2 , (8) 3 prime () denotes dierentiation d/dz. = 1 solution turns ds2 = h 2dxdx + h 2dz2 , h = 1 l z + c . (9) (10) consider case = 1 since coordinate transformation = 1 case. clearly metric describes space-time invariant poincare group iso(1, 2) longitudinal 1 dimensions. fact, h(z) continuous, symmetry so(2, 1) since metric (9) describes d-dimensional anti-de sitter space. hand, h(z) piecewise continuous, describes domain walls sited discontinuous points. solutions discussed . another possibility consider case which, h(z) piecewise continuous periodic 2. among many possibilities, discuss two particular cases depicted gure 1 solves (8). h(z) 1+c 0 h(z) 1+c 0 -1+c z 2l l (a) z 2l l (b) figure 1: function h(z) 0 z < 2l. examine two cases (a) (b) separately. (a) case here, h(z) form h(z) = 1 l z + c 1 l z + c 0 z < l l z < 2l (11) h(z) discontinuous nevertheless right properties, namely periodic period 2l easily seen fourier-series representation h(z) = 1 2 + c 4 2 xn=1,3,5, 1 n2 cos(cid:18)nz l (cid:19) , (12) satises second equation (8) everywhere rst (8) almost every- where. recalling series representation -function (z) = 1 2l + 1 l xn=1 cos(cid:18)nz l (cid:19) , (13) 2we thank l. alvarez-gaume pointing possibility 4 nd h = 2 l (cid:18)(z) (z + l)(cid:19) , (14) thus discontinuity h(z) attributed sources discontinuous points. form sources found considering energy-momentum tensor tm n case given tm n = 1 2 rm n 1 2 gm n r (d 2)(d 1) 2l2 gm n! . (15) then, straightforward verify metric (9) energy-momentum tensor given that, using (14) = d2 2 h h 3 , tzz = 0 , = 2(d2) l2 (cid:18)(z) (z + l)(cid:19) h 3 . (16) (17) thus, solution describes two domain walls placed z = 0 z = l, respectively. particular, solution invariant z 2l z seen (12) exist two xed points, z = 0 z = l. points domain walls sited. case may restrict z interval  corresponding s1/z2 orbifold transverse one-dimensional space. similar solution also found {$9804398$} context m-theory z identied eleventh dimension. constant c h(z) determined terms compactication radius rc cosmological constant l.
