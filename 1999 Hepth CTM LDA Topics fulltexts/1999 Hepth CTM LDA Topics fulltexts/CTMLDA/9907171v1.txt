to bd(2|1; k2)k1 is traced to the properties of bs(2)  bs(2)  bs(2) embeddings into bd(2|1; ) and
their relation with the dual bs(2) pairs. conversely, we show how the bs(2)k2 representations are

1. introduction

in this paper, we address a particular instance of the general problem of extending innite-
dimensional algebras by vertex operators. we show that vertex operator extensions can lead to in-

teresting and nontrivial constructions of ane lie (super)algebras and their representations. a well-
known example of an extension via vertex operators applies to the sum of two virasoro algebras with

appropriate central charges, and leads to matter coupled to gravity in the conformal gauge [12, 13].
another context where vertex operator extensions of conformal algebras are relevant is that of coset

2

bowcock, feigin, semikhatov, and taormina

conformal eld theories c = g1/g2, where the inverse problem is to reconstruct the g1 representa-
tions by combining the representations of c and g2 related by the action of vertex operators.

a natural generalisation of the situation encountered in matter plus gravity is provided by study-

ing extensions of the sum bs(2)k1  bs(2)k2 of two ane s(2) algebras at levels k1 and k2. this is

a complicated problem in general; we solve it in the case where

(1.1)

(k1 + 1)(k2 + 1) = 1,

ki  c \ {2,1}.

the result is that with the help of an additional scalar current, spin- 1

2 vertex operators extend

induced from the n + 1-dimensional representation of s(2). for generic values of the level, the

bs(2)k1  bs(2)k2 to the ane lie superalgebra bd(2|1; k2)k1. we study the representations in terms
of the subalgebra of bd(2|1; k2)k1 given by bs(2|1)k1 bu(1). let wn,k be the weyl module over bs(2)k
vacuum representation l0,0,k1 of bs(2|1)k1 is contained in a sum of tensor products of weyl modules
wn,k1 and wn,k2 of the respective algebras bs(2)k1 and bs(2)k2. more precisely,

be viewed as a duality relation between bs(2) levels, which potentially allows one to study certain
from the well-studied bs(2) representation theory at fractional level. for simplicity in illustrating
the main idea, we can replace the bs(2)ki algebras with the virasoro algebras vir(ki) obtained from
them by hamiltonian reduction, with central charges di = 13  6
ki+2  6(ki + 2). when extending
the sum vir(k1) vir(k2) by vertex operators, one must address the problem of their potential non-
locality. for instance, (a component of) the operator (i)
12 has monodromy (1)
ki+2 with
itself, which means nonlocality in general; however a bilinear combination of (1)

matter coupled to gravity in the conformal gauge; one may view the relation (1.3) with n = 0 as the
anomaly cancellation condition between matter (vir(k1)), liouville (vir(k2)) and reparametrisation

a fermion with central charge 1

algebra with central charge

which is the central charge of an n = 1 supervirasoro model. this suggests, therefore, that vir(k1)

vir(k2) extends to the n = 1 supervirasoro algebra. it also suggests that the sum bs(2)k1  vir(k2)
can be extended, when n = 2, to the ane superalgebra cosp(1|2)k1 by an inverse hamiltonian
reduction process (cf. [35]). actually, it is known [14] that the coset cosp(1|2)k1/bs(2)k1 is a virasoro
which can be obtained by hamiltonian reduction from bs(2)k2 for
second, dual bs(2) algebra in the sum.
in this paper, we study in detail the case of a dual pair of bs(2)ki algebras, where the levels are
related by (1.3) with n = 1 and, thus, a free scalar is needed to make the bs(2)k1  bs(2)k2 vertex

operators local after taking the quantum group trace. if we were to guess what conformal theory

the extended structure might be, a crude hint would be provided by evaluating its central charge,
that is,

k2+2 = 2, providing the

the last equation is the bs(2|1) ane lie superalgebra (which, remarkably, has the same number
momentum tensor); the remaining 1 corresponds to bu(1) (a free scalar theory). we derive this
the bs(2|1)k1 algebra from bs(2)k1  bs(2)k2. there exists a w algebra associated with bs(2|1); it
commute with two bs(2|1) screenings (which can be either both fermionic or one bosonic and one

principle, reconstruct the bs(2|1) algebra from bg(2) w (possibly with the help of some additional

constructions, for example choosing a particular bosonisation). on the other hand, the coset w

replaced with bs(2); this is the origin of the second (dual) bs(2) in our construction bs(2)bs(2) 
bs(2|1) (this second bs(2) is obviously not a subalgebra of bs(2|1)). the above argument is also

if two of the bs(2) algebras are dual (and the third has level 1). extending bs(2)k1 bs(2)k2 bs(2)1

special, however, in that they appear to be exactly the direct sums of bs(2|1) representations over
the spectral ow orbits. anyway, we do not focus on the bd(2|1; ) representations and concentrate
instead on the bs(2|1) algebra, whose representations have been studied in more detail (the extension
to bd(2|1; ) is however very interesting because of its close relation to the n = 4 superconformal

of bs(2)k1, bs(2)k2, and bs(2)1 representations are reducible, because all the bs(2|1) generators com-
mute with the third bd(2|1; ) cartan current. the decomposition of such a representation n into

as well as building bs(2|1) representations from tensor products of bs(2) representations as de-
scribed above, we also construct representations of the dual bs(2)k2 algebra starting with an bs(2|1)k1
of bs(2|1)k1 and relaxed verma modules of bs(2)k2. the latter provide one of the starting points in
constructing representations of the vertex operator extensions of bs(2)k1bs(2)k2, and therefore, the
construction of bs(2|1) representations. we nd several indications that the established correspon-
interesting separate problem of constructing the functors between the bs(2|1)k1 and bs(2)k1 bs(2)k2

dences between representations have functorial properties; however we leave for the future the very

representation. a key step in doing so was to establish a correspondence between verma modules

to evaluate the operator product of vertex operators qi vji,mi(zi), we use (2.8) to rearrange the

operators vj1,m1(z1) . . . vjn ,mn (zn ) such that re zi > re zi+1, and then use the operator products
vji,mi(zi)  vj,m(z)  (zi  z)jij/(2p) with re zi > re z. the point of the subsequent construction
is that dierent factors of the form (zi  z)jij/(2p) combine into integral powers, after which we no
longer need to assume re zi > re zi+1.

consider now the dual bs(2) algebra, with the vertex operators viewed as elements of c2(z) 

q(z), where the quantum group parameter is q = e2i/p = q1 in view of (2.1). similarly to the

the module v,1 over s(2)q1 is also a module over s(2)q, as we see in (a.15)(a.16). moreover,
depending on whether  is 1 or +1, this is (almost) the dual of v,1. thus, there exists the
trace (a.18) on the tensor product of the unprimed and primed vertex operators. taking this trace
over the quantum group index leaves us with a four-dimensional space:

of the wakimoto bosonisation discussed in the following section. the latter explicitly shows the
quantum group action in terms of the screening operator and contour manipulations (more precisely,
screenings (one screening in the current case of s(2)q) generate the nilpotent subalgebra of s(2)q,

bs(2|1) and bd(2|1; ) representations

while the entire quantum group is represented in terms of a construction [19, 33] using more involved
contour operations).

let us remark at this point that the currents in formulas (2.12) and (2.13) are normalised in
accordance to a particular choice of screening contour in the wakimoto representation. in general,

the normalisation depends on the precise denition of the screened vertex operators, cf. [19, 33].

2.2. the wakimoto representations of bs(2) and screened operator products. we dene

a rst-order bosonic system and an independent current by the operator products

(z) (w) =

(z) (w) = 1

(z  w)2 .

in terms of these free elds, the bs(2)p2 currents can be written as
j + =   ,
j 0 =q p
j =  +p2p  + (p  2) ,

and the vertex operators are,

similar formulae for the primed bs(2) algebra are obtained by consistently replacing the free elds

with the primed ones and replacing p with p.

the wakimoto bosonisation screening acts on a vertex operator as

the integration contour can be chosen in dierent ways; one of the possibilities is to take the contour
(2.25)

where the straight line shows the branch cut due to the nonlocality in the operator product of s(x)
and v (z). as is well known (see, e.g., [19, 33, 6]), up to a normalisation factor this contour can

be replaced with the contour running along the cut (in this case the integral is dened by analytic
continuation). we choose the latter possibility in what follows; it turns out that we will have
fewer (1) factors if we dene
(2.26)

dx s(x)v (z) ,

where the integral has to be evaluated for those parameter values where it converges and then
analytically continued.

in order to verify the bs(2|1) operator product expansions between the currents constructed in the

previous section, we need to evaluate products involving screened and unscreened vertex operators
in the combinations determined by the quantum-group trace (2.9), typically,

(sv1(z) v 1(z) + v1(z) sv 1(z))  (sv2(w) v 2(w) + v2(w) sv 2(w)),

where v and v  some bs(2) and bs(2) vertex operators. in all of the operator products that we

encounter in what follows, a nonzero contribution comes from the terms

appendix d is devoted to explicit checks of the bs(2|1) operator product expansions in the waki-

moto representation. in addition to establishing the operator product expansions, the wakimoto

bosonisation is a useful tool to verify the relation between the energy-momentum tensors underlying
the central charge balance in eq. (1.5).

construction, that of the exceptional ane lie superalgebra bd(2|1; ).
3.1. the auxiliary level-1 bs(2) algebra. we rst use the auxiliary scalar f to construct
an bs(2) algebra of level 1,
then the two cartan currents of bs(2|1)p2 and the extrabu(1) current become

see the interplay of three bs(2) algebras, two at dual levels k = p 2, k = p  2, and one at level 1,
in our construction of bs(2|1).
in the next subsection, we discuss how to embed bs(2)  bs(2)  bs(2) and bs(2|1) bu(1) in the
ane superalgebra bd(2|1; ) in such a way that the bu(1) currents (3.2)(3.4) are recovered. this
in eqs. (2.12)(2.13) in terms of vertex operators) represent in fact the bd(2|1; ) fermions.
3.2. conformal embeddings in bd(2|1; ). our conventions on d(2|1; ) are summarised in ap-

pendix c. using the notations for the roots introduced there, we write the bosonic subalgebra of
d(2|1; ) as s(2)(2)  s(2)(3)  s(2)(). when s(2|1) is regularly embedded in d(2|1; ) (i.e.
when the roots of the subalgebra are chosen as a subset of the roots of the embedding algebra), any
of these three s(2) algebras can be taken as the s(2) subalgebra of s(2|1), for which we introduce
the notation (reminding us of the h current) s(2)(), so that  = 2, 3 or . for each choice
of , there exist two regular embeddings of s(2|1) in d(2|1; ). the corresponding s(2|1) root
lattices contain  and four of the eight odd roots of d(2|1; ). from now on, we use the parame-
ter  = 
1+,   c \ {0, 1,} instead of . this parameter governs the norm of 2 and 3, and 
is always the longest root if   [ 1

we now note that the sugawara central charge of bd(2|1;

it is therefore not surprising that bs(2)  bs(2)  bs(2)

and bs(2|1) bu(1) are intimately linked, a fact already noticed earlier when the energy-momentum

tensors of the two theories were shown to coincide in a free eld representation (2.31), and also seen
from the representation decompositions in sec. 5 and the character identities (5.55).

superdimension of s(2|1) is zero, and it turns out that for certain relations between the level

the relation between bs(2)  bs(2)  bs(2) and bs(2|1) bu(1) is based on the fact that the
embeddings into bd(2|1; 
lemma 3.1. the sugawara central charge of bs(2)(2)
two of the bs(2) subalgebras are dual to each other in the sense of eq. (1.1). moreover, when this is
so, the third bs(2) algebra has level 1.
for  =   1 (in which case bs(2)(2) and bs(2)() are dual and bs(2)(3) has level 1), for  = 
(with bs(2)(3) and bs(2)() dual), or for  = 1 (with bs(2)(2) and bs(2)(3) dual). conversely, we
have to consider three dierent possibilities to pick out two dual bs(2) algebras.
1. taking the pair bs(2)(2) and bs(2)() leads to  =   1 and the relevant embedding is
2. for the pair bs(2)(3) and bs(2)() chosen as dual,  =  and the relevant embedding is
3. taking bs(2)(2) and s(2)(3) as the dual pair leads to  = 1 and, thus, to the embedding

this completes the proof of the lemma.

for unitary representations, we would then conclude that embeddings (3.5), (3.7), (3.8), and (3.9)
are conformal, since the coset virasoro algebra l = lg  lh has vanishing central charge, and the
only unitary representation of the coset algebra in this case is the trivial one [18], leading to the
following formal relation between characters,

we want to argue that, in order for this to be so in the case of a bg representation with highest

vector |i, it is sucient to demand that the state l2|i is null (i.e., singular or a descendant of
a singular state), and that the same condition holds for the vacuum representation, i.e. l2|0i is
null, where |0i is the usual sl(2, c) invariant vacuum, which is also invariant under the action of the

14

bowcock, feigin, semikhatov, and taormina

nite dimensional algebra g. indeed, the operator product expansion of l with one of the currents

j a() ofbg is of the form,

(3.11)

l(z)j a() =

x()

(z  )2 +

y ()
z  

+ regular,

and the state associated with the residue of the double pole is,

x1|0i = (j a)1l2|0i = (j a)1|0i,

(3.12)
for some constant . since (j a)1|0i is not null and yet our assumption demands that the vector
(j a)1l2|0i vanishes or is null, it follows that  = 0, so that x() must vanish identically. thus,
(3.13)

m, ln] = m aby b

m+n,

[j a

so that ln and y a
n are just two kacmoody primary elds in some representation of g. moreover this
representation is nite since the number of weight-two states in 0 is nite, and all the states in the
multiplet are null. we now return to the representation |i which is not the vacuum representation.
it is easy to show that

(3.14)

(lg)1l2|i = 3l1|i,

so that this state must also be null. since l1 and l2 generate the whole virasoro algebra, it
follows that ln|i must be null for any n, and hence any of the yn|i will also be null for a y in
the null multiplet of weight-two elds. as a consequence of the above remarks, a state of the form

can be shown inductively by pushing ln to the right. the action of l on the representation  is
therefore eectively trivial as claimed.

|wi = ln{. . .}|i, where . . . consists of some arbitrary collection ofbg current modes, is null, as
for instance, in the case of embedding (3.9), where bd(2|1; 

1)2|0i
is a singular vector, where e
1 is the usual ane simple root associated with the step operator
corresponding to the highest root  of g. this state is a singular vector at grade two as is l2|0i,
so it isnt unreasonable to argue that they are in the same multiplet under g. if this were the case,
our condition that l2|i is null is equivalent to the condition that (e
1)2|i is null. the latter
is implied by the vanishing of h|(e

this means we only should see the unitary singlet and doublet representations of the s(2)()

indeed inspection of our character sum rules reveals that only the characters of these s(2)()
representations occur.

appearing in the bd(2|1; 
we now proceed to identify which of the bs(2|1) embeddings (3.5) (with  =   1, or 1) is
of bs(2|1) to be k, so that its subalgebra bs(2)() is also at level k.

which we summarize in table 1. there, we label the even subalgebra of bs(2|1) bu(1) as

to e =  with  =p1/2()2, and nally, a(z) corresponds to e =   with  =p1/()2.

4. constructing the representations

we now construct relations between representations of bs(2|1)k and of the bs(2)k and bs(2)k
algebras with dual k and k. the vertex operator realisation of bs(2|1) in sec. 2 involves taking
quantum traces of products of bs(2)k and bs(2)k vertex operators, suggesting that representations
of bs(2|1) could be constructed as sums of products of representations of these dual bs(2) algebras
(and the auxiliary bs(2)1 representations). however, identifying which bs(2) representations to
choose in order to obtain, e.g., the category o of bs(2|1) representations does not follow from the

operator construction alone, and the question is analysed in sec. 4.3.

bs(2|1) and bd(2|1; ) representations

on the other hand, one can address the inverse problem of reconstructing bs(2)kbs(2)k represen-
tations out of a given bs(2|1) representation. by simply restricting the latter, one obviously arrives
at representations of bs(2)k. for the dual bs(2)k algebra, which is not a subalgebra of bs(2|1), the
construction of its representations starting with an bs(2|1)k representation is provided in secs. 4.1

and 4.2. the direct and the inverse problems each consists, rst, in constructing a representation
and second, in decomposing it. the second step, which requires a more detailed analysis of the

17

representations constructed, will be addressed in sec. 5.

we continue using both k = p  2 and k = p  2 as the parameters.

the construction goes by picking out the appropriate terms in the operator products (c2(z) 

4.1. reconstructing the dual bs(2) pair. we rst address the problem of reconstructing the dual
pair bs(2)k bs(2)k starting with the bs(2|1)k algebra. one of these is obviously the subalgebra of
bs(2|1), and thus the problem is to complete the u(1) subalgebra to the second (primed) bs(2).

doublets. this yields the dual bs(2) operator product expansions after a correction with an extra
scalar eld (recall that we also needed an auxiliary scalar in constructing bs(2|1) out of two bs(2)

algebras). we, thus, introduce the scalar eld  with the operator product

we will write |j, , kibs(2) for the untwisted state |j, , k; 0ibs(2). when there are no more
independent relations (no singular vectors are factored over), the module spanned by the bs(2)k

proof of the lemma. let uh,h+; be the operator corresponding to the twisted highest-weight

this gives precisely the twisted relaxed highest-weight conditions for the state in (4.7). we now
choose  = 2 for simplicity (taking  dierent from 2 would result in the spectral ow transform
of this state and, thus, in the twist of the entire module). we then nd that the |h, h+; ; 2i

pearing on the right-hand side are insensitive to the bs(2|1) spectral ow parameter , this induces

between spectral-ow orbits of bs(2|1)k and bs(2)k modules.

an interesting question is whether this correspondence can be extended to a functor; answering
this involves, in particular, investigating the correspondence between singular vectors appearing

in the modules related by the correspondence. we now show that the  arrow descends to
submodules generated from a class of the so-called charged singular vectors.

the relaxed verma modules may contain singular vectors such that the corresponding quotients
are the usual verma or twisted verma modules. these are the charged singular vectors [17], which

occur in the module built on the vector |j, , kibs(2) whenever  = ch(n, j) for n  z, where

ch(n, j) = n(n + 1) + 2nj ,

(4.18)

n  z .

when (4.18) holds, the charged singular vector reads

(4.19)

|c(n, j, k)ibs(2) =( (0 )n |j, ch(n, j), kibs(2) ,

n  1 ,
0 )n+1 |j, ch(n, j), kibs(2) , n  0 .
this state satises the usual verma-module highest-weight conditions for n  1 and the twisted
verma highest-weight conditions with the twist parameter  = 1 for n  1 [17].

remarkably, we see from (4.13) and (4.18) that a charged singular vector occurs in the relaxed

verma module rh+

which are the conditions (b.11) for the existence of charged singular vectors (b.12) and (b.14) in

state lead to class iv and class v representations). thus,

in addition to the existence result asserted in the lemma, the charged singular vectors (4.19)

in the bs(2)k representation on ph,h+,k;  e actually evaluate as the respective bs(2|1)k charged

which is precisely the corresponding charged singular vector in (b.14). next, let n  0. note that
in this case, the charged singular vector (+

weight conditions that are twisted by 1 with respect to the bs(2) verma-module highest-weight

our aim is to combine eqs. (4.24) and (4.26) with the action of bs(2)k vertex operators such that
the bs(2|1) fermions e1, e2, f 1, and f 2 then act on a space of the form
(where r are some bs(2)k modules). the very existence of such a space endowed with the repre-

sentations induced from the vertex operator action is not obvious a priori, because vertex operator
action in each sector gives rise to the spaces z c((z)) with non-integral  that are dierent for
dierent terms (recall that p = k + 2  c \ {0, 1} and j  c in (4.24)); it does not therefore induce
a representation on a space of the form (4.27) unless the modules r(n) are judiciously chosen.
a crucial point making such a choice possible is the quantum group trace in the construction of

assume that the product of an bs(2)k highest-weight state, an bs(2)k relaxed highest-weight state,
and an bs(2)1 highest-weight state, |j, ki  |j, , k; ibs(2)  |i  vj,k  rj,,k;  f, is a
twisted highest-weight state with respect to bs(2|1)k (see (b.3)) tensored with a highest-weight

vector in the fock module aa over the free current a(z) in eq. (2.17); we dene the highest-weight
vectors |ai  aa such that
(4.28)

a0|aia =p2(k + 1) a|aia .

assuming, thus, that |j, ki|j, , k; ibs(2)|i = |h, h+, k; i|aia, we evaluate the eigenvalues
of the bs(2|1) cartan generators (and also of a0, see (2.17)) on this vector. using (2.16) and (2.17),

we obtain the eigenvalues

5.1. decomposing the bs(2|1) representation. the bs(2|1)k representation on the space nj,j
constructed in the previous section is by no means irreducible, since all the bs(2|1) generators
commute with the current a(z) constructed in (2.17). thus, nj,j decomposes asl
where p() are some bs(2|1)k modules and aa are the fock modules over the free scalar;  labels
evaluating the bs(2|1) highest-weight parameters, we nd that the dierent bs(2|1) representa-

tions p() are the spectral ow transform of each other, with the highest-weight parameters except
the twist being the same for all these modules. taking for deniteness vj+ n

where we again can use the -function to replace yj  (k+1)j with 1. this is identical with the
character obtained for the left-hand side (with  = 0; a nonzero value of , as well as of the twist 
of the r modules, is restored by the overall spectral ow transform). we thus conclude that there

are the twisted bs(2|1) verma modules on the right-hand side of (5.1).

5.3. from verma modules to irreducible representations. to obtain the decomposition for-

mula of form (5.1) for other (e.g., irreducible) representations, one can start with appropriate verma
modules (e.g., those with dominant highest-weights, so as to arrive at the admissible representations
eventually) and follow the corresponding bgg resolution, with (5.1) applied again to each term in

the resolution. if the decomposition formula is of a functorial nature (i.e., the appearance of singular
vectors is synchronised on both sides), one then arrives at a similar formula for the irreducible

representations. here, we follow this program only as far as the rst step consisting in taking the
quotients with respect to the charged singular vectors. in the end, we conrm the decomposition

identities for irreducible representations by verifying the corresponding character identities.

we see from (4.18) and (b.11) that whenever a charged singular vector occurs in one (and hence in

all) of the relaxed verma modules rj n
pj,(k+1)j,k;,   z, contains a charged singular vector. (proceeding in the inverse direction, we

29

saw the same correspondence in sec. 4.2, where we made it even more explicit.) for weyl modules,
we then obtain the result stated in the introduction by taking the appropriate quotients of (5.1).

in what follows, we discuss the form that the decomposition takes for a class of irreducible
representations. we nd which character identities (sumrules of type (5.3)) must follow from this

formula, and derive them independently. this is a strong argument in favour of the functorial
properties of decomposition (5.1). we now explain which identity is to be tested at the level of

character sumrules.

we take a rational level k in the positive zone expressed through two positive integers t and u via

(5.12)

k + 2 = t

u 6= 1 .

we require the relaxed verma module rj,0(j,j),k at the origin in (5.1) to have the charged singular

(k + 1)j = 1 + j +  ,

vector |c(, j, k)ibs(2); more precisely, we satisfy eq. (4.18) by choosing
for both bs(2)k and bs(2)k, we are interested in the case where the irreducible representations
are admissible [27]. we recall here that the quotient of rj,,k/ev with respect to the submodule
generated from the charged singular vector |c(, j, k)ibs(2),   z, is a verma module if   0 or
a twisted verma module (with the twist 1) if   1, and the spin of the highest-weight vector of
the quotient module is

(5.15)

(r + s  s + )t = (r + r)u ,

implying that r + r is a multiple of t, which means r + r = t once r and r are in the admissible
range given above. we then have r = u  s + s  , and therefore (choosing   0, so as to have
the untwisted verma modules in the quotients of the relaxed verma modules, after which we can
set  = 0), we obtain the representations

remark 5.1. that the representations outside the admissible range decouple can also be un-

are singled out from the free-eld spaces as the cohomology of an appropriate brst complex (for

derstood by starting with free-eld realisations of bs(2) modules. the corresponding formula of
type (5.1) then gives some bs(2|1) representations (whose structure depends on the free-eld repre-
sentations chosen for bs(2)k and bs(2)k). now, admissible representations of either bs(2)k or bs(2)k
tex operators mapping between the individual bs(2)k and bs(2)k representations then extend to the

entire complex; this allows one to single out trivial vertex operators (see, e.g., [6]) that induce zero

example, a felder-like complex [2], but in general other free-eld resolutions are needed). the ver-

mapping on the cohomology (as a rule, nontrivial mappings via vertex operator exist if and only if
the corresponding fusion rule coecient is nonzero). in the admissible case, the vertex operators
become trivial as soon as the spin j + n
2 goes outside the corresponding kac table (which
occurs simultaneously for the unprimed and primed modules in (5.16)(5.18)). this allows us to
consistently restrict to only a nite number (exactly t  1) of terms on the left-hand side of (5.1).

specialising to the integrable (unitary) bs(2)k representations, we take the level k = 2ut

an integer, whence t = u + 1 which implies s = 1 and k = u  1. it follows that the level k is

are parametrised as

bs(2|1) and bd(2|1; ) representations

where h = 2 is the dual coxeter number of s(2) [27, 30]. in the present instance, we have k0 = u1.

note that (5.19) is also principal admissible with respect to bs(2|1), with k0 = 0, since hs(2|1) = 1.

in addition to only a nite number of irreducible representations appearing on the left-hand side

of the decomposition formula as discussed above, another eect occurring for the representations

this is the space to be decomposed into bs(2|1) 1
under consideration is the periodicity under the spectral ow on the bs(2|1) side, where the spectral

ow (b.7) with  = u produces an isomorphic representation. in the analogue of (5.1) for such
representations lh,h+,k, we split the summation over the twists on the right-hand side by writing  =

this gives the parameters of the twist-zero highest-weight vectors in the bs(2|1) modules entering

the decomposition formula. all of these representations are obtained by taking the quotient of the

verma modules with two charged singular vectors, one of type (b.12) and the other of type (b.14),
with the integers labelling these singular vectors being of the opposite signs (obviously, there ex-

ist other singular vectors that have to be factored over to obtain the irreducible representation).
according to the values of h and h+, the irreducible representation characters in any chosen
sector of the theory (ramond, neveuschwarz, etc.) at level k = 1

2u(u + 1) characters) and of class v ( 1

indeed, according to (5.32), the relation between h+ and h involves a strictly positive integer ,
and therefore, one is naturally in a class v context. the labels m and m are given by (5.42) with h

these can be translated into class-iv labels in the appropriate range in accordance with the spectral

there is complete agreement between the sumrules (5.55) and the decomposition formula (5.24).

and the set of 2u sumrules (5.55) is closed under the above spectral ow. moreover, this set carries
a unitary representation of the modular group, as can be explicitly checked by using the modular

transformations of bs(2) characters at integrable and fractional levels. a complete treatment of

the modular properties must include the neveuschwarz, the super ramond and super neveu

schwarz sectors, which may be obtained as follows [20]. the neveuschwarz sumrules are derived
by owing the ramond sector sumrules according to,

it should be noted that the group of modular transformations and the group of spectral ow transfor-
mations on characters are combined into an extended modular group via the semi-direct product,
in which the spectral ow transformations are the invariant subgroup; thus, the extended modu-

lar group representation can be induced from the spectral ow representation, and these are the
u1 representations. the relevance of these

transformations that close on the chosen set of bs(2|1) 1
facts to the representation theory of bd(2|1; ) are beyond the present scope and are left aside for

future work.

twisted by the bs(2|1) spectral ow (5.1). we also derived the corresponding character identities
relating bs(2|1) characters to the constituent bs(2)k and bs(2)k characters, both for verma modules
(sec. 5.2) and irreducible representations (eq. (5.55)). the latter identities involve bs(2|1) represen-
bs(2) 1

another important point raised by the relation between representations and by the corresponding

character identities is that of the closure under modular transformations. the bs(2|1) characters

appearing in these identities do carry a unitary representation of the modular group [23], and using
this information, one can explicitly check that the 2u functions a(),  = 0, . . . 2u  1 on the
left-hand side of the sumrules (5.55) also carry a unitary representation of the modular group. it
is therefore tempting to identify these functions with the characters corresponding to a particular

a very interesting general problem is to verify the functorial properties of the correspondence

established between the bs(2)k  bs(2)k and bs(2|1)k representations; in the simpler case of the
relation between bs(2) and n = 2 superconformal representations [17], a similar relation is the
of two algebras obtained by extending the universal enveloping of bs(2) and n = 2, respectively, by

the spectral ow operator). we have seen that in the present case, the spectral ow plays a very
similar role, and thus an interesting problem is whether we again can construct a similar functor;

equivalence of categories modulo the spectral ow (i.e., the equivalence of representation theories

which may be extended to an argument demonstrating the functorial properties of the correspon-

dence found in this paper. we note that the character identity corresponding to (1.2) turns out

to be equivalent to the character identity derived from the correspondence between the bs(2) and

n = 2 verma modules [16]; this identity has also been known in a dierent representation-theory
context [28].

as another future research direction, we note the possibility to use various free-eld (and other)

to relate the corresponding screening operators and interpret this relation in terms of the respective
quantum groups.

finally, it is worth exploring the geometric interpretation of the construction for bs(2|1) found

in this paper. despite the complication generated by the presence of the odd integer n = 1 on

the right-hand side of (1.3), we expect to be able to proceed similarly to the n = 0 case, relevant
to the coupling of matter to gravity, where no auxiliary scalar is needed and the basic geometric

setting involves the loop group fsl(2, c) = { : s1  sl(2, c)}.

functions on the group and can be viewed as matrix elements of the evaluation representation (in

contrast with the bs(2|1) case, c2(z)  c2(z) do commute). the constraint on k1 and k2 actually

follows from imposing the knizhnikzamolodchikov equation on the c2(z) c2(z) vertex operators.
the vacuum representation of the extended algebra can be described in terms of distributions
on g+  the subgroup of the loop group consisting of mappings that extend to the origin from

holomorphic maps  : {z  c   : |z| > 1  sl(2, c)} [32]. the equivalence classes x(n) are

right bs(2) actions; this time, however, the weyl modules are combined dierently since w  wm

in the dual module with the dual basis vi, we then nd from (a.5) and (a.2):

(a.14)

e v0 =  q v1 ,
e v1 = 0 ,

k v0 = q1 v0 ,

k v1 = q v1 ,

f v0 = 0 ,
f v1 =   q1v0 .

let v,1 be a similar module over s(2)q1, with the basis v0 and v1. as is easy to check, it is

also a module over s(2)q, the s(2)q action being given by

(a.15)

e v0 = v1 ,
e v1 = 0 ,

k v0 = q1 v0 ,
k v1 = q v1 ,

f v0 = 0 ,

the tensor product of s(2)q modules v,1  v,1 is decomposed as
(a.17)

v,1  v,1 = v,0  v,2 ,

bs(2|1) and bd(2|1; ) representations

where v,2 is generated from v1 v0, and v,0 from v0 v0 qv1 v1. the projection v,1 v,1 
v,0 can be dened in terms of the trace h,i such that
(a.18)

hv0, v0i = 1 ,

hv1, v1i = q ,

hv0, v1i = 0 ,

hv1, v0i = 0 .

the vertex operator construction involves this trace operation in the case where  = 1 and  =

1: from the quantum group representation standpoint, each bs(2|1)k (or bd(2|1; )k) fermion is

constructed as

(a.19)

qv1  v1 + v0  v0 = qv1  f v0  f v1  v0 .

with the basis of the quantum group module represented by the vertex operators as in sec. 2,
we identify qf in the rst term with the screening operator s acting in the unprimed sector, and
f in the second terms with s acting in the primed sector; we then denote the action of s or s
on the respective vertex operator with a tilde. this gives (2.12)(2.13), where we omit the tensor
product sign and write the primed and the unprimed multipliers in the reversed order compared to

the formula with the tensor-product notation; we hope that this minor notational discrepancy does
not lead to confusion.

appendix b. bs(2|1) algebra, spectral ow, and charged singular vectors

the ane lie superalgebra bs(2|1) consists of four bosonic currents e12, h, f 12, and h + and
four fermionic ones, e1, e2, f 1, and f 2. the bs(2) subalgebra is generated by e12, h, and
f 12, and it commutes with the bu(1) subalgebra generated by h +. for reference, we give in fig. 2

the two-dimensional root diagram of the nite dimensional lie superalgebra s(2|1), represented in
minkowski space with the fermionic roots along the light cone directions. we sometimes refer to
the eigenvalue corresponding to a given eigenstate of the cartan generator h0 (resp. h +
0 ) as the
isospin (resp. the hypercharge) of that state. at level k, the nonvanishing commutation relations
are given by

applying the spectral ow to modules gives twisted modules. a twisted module with a vacuum

to check that the highest-weight conditions satised by |c ()(n, h, k; )i imply that this vector

appendix c. d(2|1; )

the one-parameter family of exceptional lie superalgebras d(2|1; ), with   c \ {0,1,}
are basic type ii classical simple complex lie superalgebras in the kac classication [24, 11]. at
each xed value of , d(2|1; ) is a rank 3 superalgebra with six even roots and eight odd roots. its
dual coxeter number h is zero and its superdimension, which is the number of bosonic generators
minus the number of fermionic generators, is sdim = 9  8 = 1. the central charge of the virasoro

the bosonic part of d(2|1; ) is s(2)  s(2)  s(2), and the action of d(2|1; )0 on d(2|1; )1
is the product of 2-dimensional representations. the root diagram (see fig. 3) can be visualised in
a parallelipiped in 3d space with metric gij = diag(1,1, 1). all odd roots are at the vertices of
the parallelipiped on the light cone. six even roots lie on the three lines through the centre of the
faces. the weyl group does not act transitively on the set of simple roots, and there are six choices

of simple root systems.

we describe in more detail the system of simple roots with one odd root, 1, and two even roots,
2 and 3. the three regular s(2) subalgebras are in the directions of 2, 3 and  = 21 +2 +3.
the relevant scalar products are summarised as
