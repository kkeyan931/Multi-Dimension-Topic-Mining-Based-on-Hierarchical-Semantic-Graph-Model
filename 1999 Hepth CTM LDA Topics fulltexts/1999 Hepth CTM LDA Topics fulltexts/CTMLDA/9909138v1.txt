abstract

we discuss the two-dimensional dilaton gravity with a scalar eld as the source matter

where the coupling with gravity is given, besides the minimal one, through an external

eld. this coupling generalizes the conformal anomaly in the same way as those found

in recent literature, but with a diferent motivation. the modication to the hawking

radiation is calculated explicity and show an additional term that introduces a dependence

on the (eective) mass of the black-hole.

1 introduction

it is widely recognized that two-dimensional models of gravity can give us a better

understanding of the gravitational quantum eects. these models, derived either from a

string motivated eective action [1] or from some low-dimensional version of the einstein

equations [2], have a rich structure in spite of their relative simplicity. gravitational

collapse, black holes and quantum eects are examples of subjects whose description

is rather complicated in four-dimensional gravity while their lower-dimensional versions

turn out to be more treatable, sometimes completely solved. this is the case of the

seminal work of callan, giddings, harvey and strominger (cghs)[1], where black-hole

solutions are found and analysed semi-classically, giving us a two dimensional version of

the hawking eect.

in the cghs model, the starting point is the four-dimensional einstein-hilbert action

in the spherically symmetric metric, where the schwarzchild one is the simplest case.

then, the assumption of dependence in two variables for all the elds is done and, with

a suitable form of the metric, it is possible to integrate the angular dependence. the

nal result is a two-dimensional action with a new eld, besides the gravitational one,

called the dilaton, that can be taken as the relic of the integrated coordinates. this is the

two-dimensional dilaton gravity. some improvements have been done [3] to circumvent

diculties that arise from its quantum version, but leaving the initial purpose unchanged.

black-hole solutions are found to be formed from non-singular initial conditions,

namely a source of scalar matter coupled minimally with the two-dimensional gravity

sector (the terminology will be claried later). there is also a linear vacuum region,

which turns to be relevant to these models.

since these results are classical, the next step is the search for quantum eects:

it

is well known that whereas classical black-holes radiate nothing the semi-classical ones

render a thermal radiation by a proccess called hawking-beckestein eect. an important

feature of the semi-classical version for this eect is the conformal anomaly, since the

hawking radiation can be derived from this quantity. recently, a series of works[10] gives

2

atention to the generalization of the conformal anomaly to the cghs model, with diferent

coupling between the scalar eld and gravitation.

by semi-classical version of this theory we mean the scalar eld quantized in the

curved, classical, background. however , as pointed out before [6,7,8], we must be careful

with the eld variable to be considered when we use the fujikawa method. in the present

case we make a redenition of the scalar eld variable that, in the two dimensional case,

results in a more general expression for the trace anomaly. we discuss here how this

redenition generates the same expression to the generalized anomaly found in [10] in a

simple and direct way. this is one of the results of this work.

on other hand, since the anomaly is used to calculate the hawking radiation in the two

dimensional case, we can expect new contributions to this quantity from the new terms of

the conformal anomaly. in the cghs model, these new terms give a generalization to the

expression of the hawking radiation that depend of the eective mass of the black-hole,

absent in the original calculation.

this article is organized as follows:

in the next section we discuss the motivation

for the denition of a new eld variable, the modication in the original action and the

resulting expression for the trace anomaly in a direct way. after that, we present without

details the main results of the cghs model concerning the black hole radiation to x

notation, then, following the same steps as in [1], we calculate the new expression for the

hawking radiation derived from the modied anomaly. discussions and nal remarks are

in the conclusion.

3

2 the 2d dilaton gravity with non-minimal coupling

the semi-classical quantization via functional method requires the integration over

elds (the scalar one in this particular case). on the other hand, we are interested in

theories that have the full quantized version free of anomalies. this paradigm can be

worked out via the brst analysis of the theory by using the fujikawas technique [6,7].

in this framework, the quantized theory is anomaly-free provided the functional measure

is brst-invariant.

it follows that this invariance requires a redenition of the eld

variables, the so-called gravitational dressing, and we must consider these new elds as

the variables of the model that we are studying. we stress that without this modication

the conservation of the quantized energy-momentum tensor (emt) is not veried [7].

another remarkable fact is that the trace anomaly would be null (only in the 2d case).

for the present case, 2d scalar eld f , this redenition means

f  f = (g)( 1

4 )f,

where g = detg.

the original action can be rewriten in terms of this new variable:

s[f, g] =

1

2 z d2xg ff  s[ f , g] =

1

2 z d2x f f

(1)

(2)

it is straightforward to see that the action for the new variables is not conformal

invariant, since by a transformation as

the eld f transform as

now, let us use the conformal gauge

g



 = e2g



f  f

= e f .

g = e2

(g)( 1

4 ) = e

4

(3)

(4)

(5)

and write

so, in this gauge, a conformal transformation on f

 is equivalent to make



f

= (ef )



= eef



  

=  + 

(6)

(7)

using these relations, we can dene a non-minimal coupling to the eld variable

through a gauge type eld, namely

where

tranforms as

 f = (  a) f

a = 



 = a + 
a

(8)

(9)

(10)

with the denition (8), we can write a conformally invariant action to the elds f and

g:

or

s[ f , g] =

1

2 z d2x  f 

f

s[ f , g] = 

1

2 z d2x f(  aa + a) f

(11)

(12)

this modication leads to a generalization of the value of trace anomaly which is easily

calculated, since the eld a is not quantized and can be considered as an external eld.

the resulting anomaly is [8]:

r  r(generalized) = r + (aa  a)

(13)

5

here, the parameter  shows us the presence of non-minimal coupling ( = 1) or its

absence ( = 0).

antecipating a result from the next section, to wit the conformal factor  equal to the

dilaton eld , we have:

r(generalized) = r + ( + )

(14)

there are many recent works [10] dealing with this general value for the 2d trace

anomaly, some of them with others but related motivation , rendering dierent numerical

values for the extra terms in (14). this does not change our analysis.

6

3 the cghs model for the 2d dilaton gravity and the

hawking radiation

intending to compare results, we present in this section the cghs model for the two

dimensional gravity and, specically, the expression of the radiation of the black hole,

derived from the semi-classical version following the same steps as in [1].

the starting point is the action

s =

1

2 z d2xg e2(cid:26)r + 4()2 + 42(cid:27).

(15)

here, r is the bidimensional scalar curvature and  is to be considered as a cosmologi-

cal constant. as mentioned before, the dilaton eld , that in two dimensional space time

is a scalar, came from the angular part of the original 4d metric , so that this action must

be considered as the pure gravitational part. stressing this armative is the possibility

to make the dilaton equal to the gravitational eld, at least classically.

using the light-cone coordinates and the conformal gauge, the metric becomes

g+ = 

1
2

e2 , g++ = g = 0.

(16)

this two dimensional model shows a black hole type solution when scalar elds  are

considered as matter source in x+ = x+

0 , traveling in the x direction, with the intensity

proportional to the constant a.

the solutions for the resulting equations are:

e2 = e2 =

m

  2xx+

(17)

for x+ > x+

0 and for x+ < x+

0  is identied with the mass
of the hole. note that  =  is a consequence of the calculation and it will be used later.

0 we have the vacuum. m = ax+

up to this point, all the results are classical and to obtain information about the

hawking radiation we must consider quantum eects. this can be done through the

relation between the trace anomaly and the components of the vacuum expectation value

7

(vev) of the energy momentum tensor (emt) [9] . in two dimensions, the vev for the

massless eld is given by

ht 

 i =

n
24

r

(18)

where r is the scalar curvature and n is related with the number of the elds in the

model. of course, the rhs of this equation is only due to the quantum corrections since

the classical expression for the trace of the emt is null for zero mass elds. up to

numerical factors, the expression to this anomaly is the same to all kinds of elds.

the conservation of the emt must be imposed, so

the solutions of these equations are, in the conformal gauge,

hti = 0.

and

t =   2

+ + t(x+)

t++ = ++  2

 + t+(x)

(19)

(20)

(21)

the limits of (20) and (21) at the assimptotical regions , i + and i , give us the value

of t+ and t. in order to compare with the literature, we use the same coordinates as in

[cghs]:

x+ =

ey+

1


and x = 

1


ey

+

a
2

.

(22)

these denitions result in a new metric but conformally related with the at one like

the former or, in others words, they preserve the conformal gauge. this new metric is
obtained by writing (17) in terms of the variables y+ and y giving the conformal factor

as

8

(1 + a

 ey)1

for y+ < y+
0

e2 =

(1 + a

 e(y

y++y+

0 ))1

for y+ > y+
0 ,

(23)

where x+

0 = ey+
0 .

the requeriment that these expressions vanish in the vacuun ( x+ < x+

0 ) gives us the
values of t+ and t and can be calculated at the limits ey   and ey   a
 .
this condition applied in (20), give us

t = 2
4

(1  (1 +

a


ey

)2).

(24)

the value for the t component at y+   (x+  ) is the ux across the future
null innity and, taken this limit again in (20), we see that the remaining term is just t.
the hawking radiation is the value of the t near the horizon ( at y  , it

vanishes):

x  

a
2

or

ey

 0,

using (24) and (20), the nal expression is:

t horizon



=

2
4

.

(25)

(26)

at this point, it is worth mentionning that the absence of the mass in (26) is peculiar

of the cghs model.

now, let us consider the modications in the expression to the anomaly and show how

this result aects the expression for the hawking radiation. our strategy will be to follow

the same steps as those showed above, using the expression (13) in (18) and (19).

with our choice to the gauge, the trace anomaly is now given by

r = e2(8+  6(16+ + 64+)).

(27)

the non-zero components of relation (18) turns to be

9

t+ = + + +,

(28)

where the constants  and  were redened in terms of those ones of (13). in this way, it

is simple to see that the new contribution comes from the second term in rhs of (28).

following the same steps as before, namely using (28) in the (18) and (19), we have ,

e.g, for the t component

t = t =0

 + [

1
2

()2 + 2

  2()2] + t(y)

(29)

 is given by (20) or (21), depending on which portion of the space time we are

where t =0
considering: at the y+ < y+
do not depend on y+. consequently t(y) has the same value calculated previously.

0 region, there is no extra contribution, since the new terms

as before, the expression for t(y) at y+ > y+

0 is obtained by applying the assimptotical

limit at the vacuum region, y  0:

t(y) = t(y)=0 + 


4

(

1
2

+

1

e4  2),

with t(y)=0 given by(26) and  by (23).

finally, taking the appropriated limits, we arrive at the desired expression,

t horizon



=

2
4

[ + ln(

m
a

)]

(30)

(31)

where the constants  and  were redened again for simplicity.

the modication of the expression of the hawking radiation (31) was already expected,

since the expression to the anomaly was modied. the dependence with the eective mass

arises due the nonlinearity of the extra term in (27) and is a direct consequence of the

new couplings introduced before. this is another result of this work.

4 conclusions and final remarks

in this paper, we use the non-minimal coupling between the scalar eld and 2d gravi-

tation that gives rise to a generalization to the trace anomaly. the non-minimal coupling

includes a type-gauge eld , given in terms of the gravitation (or the dilaton in the cghs

model ) eld. the motivation of the introduction of this extra coupling is the requirement

of the conformal invariance of the action for the redened eld that, dierently to the

original, is not conformally invariant.

the semiclassical quantization allows us to consider this gauge eld as an external

one, rendering the calculation of the anomaly very simple: we just need to add the new

terms that appear in the equation of motion derived from (12).

the expression for the auxiliary eld is due to the fact that in two dimensions we

allways can use the conformal gauge. in higher dimensions, this choice would be very

restrictive but, in this case, it is not nescessary to redene the matter eld to satisfy (19)

and the denition of the conformal gauge eld is straightfoward [13] . actually, in the 4d

case, (19) is used to x some of numerical values of the emt [5].

in two dimensional space-time the calculation of the hawking radiation is easily ob-

tained via its relation with the trace anomaly [9]. the calculations using the cghs model

yield a expression for black hole radiation that do not depend on the mass of the hole. on

the contrary, in the schwarzchild black hole, there is such dependence and has important

consequences on the behaviour of these objects[9].

when we use the generalized conformal anomaly the resulting expression to the hawk-

ing radiation has a dependence with the mass. the modication in the hawking radiation

was expected because the relations (13) and (18) and we can expect a more general be-

haviour for these structures. we mention also that, in the cghs model, the dependence

of the radiation with the temperature is assured by the relation with the  parameter,

since the temperature in this case is given by [12]:

t =


2

11

(32)

and it is found to be the same as in the four dimensional case, to wit, t  t 2 (in this
case, t  m and t  m 2). however, the modication in (31) breaks the relation
between radiation and temperature so this result must be taken as a higher order term

and not as the complete expression.

finally, it must be interesting to study others models using the non-minimal coupling

to see what are the consequences of this choice. works in this direction are in progress.
