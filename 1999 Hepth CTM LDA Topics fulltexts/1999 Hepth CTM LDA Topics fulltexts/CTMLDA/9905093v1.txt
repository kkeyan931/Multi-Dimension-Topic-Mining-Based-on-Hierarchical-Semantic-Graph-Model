quantum mechanics it is argued that there exist zero-
energy solutions of the schrodinger equation satisfying
the appropriate boundary conditions.

the so-called yang-mills mechanics originates
from yang-mills eld theory under the supposi-
tion of the spatial homogeneity of the gauge elds.
since its introduction twenty years ago [1] this
model has been studied extensively from dierent
points of view [2] - [13]. the model is known to ex-
hibit stochastical behaviour at the classical level.
in particular it has been shown for a simplied two-
dimensional version of the model that it is nonin-
tegrable [3]. how this reects itself on the corre-
sponding quantum mechanical problem is still un-
der investigation [4] - [6] , [10], [11]. furthermore it
oers the possibility to develop methods generaliz-
able to the study of the corresponding non-abelian
gauge eld theory. with this point of view yang-
mills quantum mechanics has been investigated in
the small volume approximation [5], in the small
coupling limit on the lattice using the semiclassi-
cal approximation [9], and to estimate the glueball
spectrum [13]. furthermore the question of the
existence of normalizable zero-energy wave func-
tions in supersymmetric matrix models as general-
izations of yang-mills mechanics is under intensive
investigation (see e.g. [14] and references therein).
in the present work we would like to investigate
the groundstate of su (2) yang-mills quantum me-
chanics using the variational approach. the quan-
tum treatment of such models is confronted with
the diculties due to the existence of the non-
abelian gauss law constraints and the presence
of the unphysical degrees of freedom. in [12] it has

been shown that classical yang-mills mechanics,
after the elimination of all unphysical degrees of
freedom, reduces to the equivalent unconstrained
system described by the hamiltonian

this hamiltonian is dened on the phase space
spanned by the three canonical pairs xi, pi and
the three so(3) left-invariant killing vectors i
satisfying the poisson bracket relations {i, j} =
ijkk . each of the three conguration space
variables xi
is dened on the positive half line.
the hamiltonian (1) has been derived from con-
ventional su (2) yang-mills mechanics writing the
spatially homogeneous gauge elds aai := aai(t)
in the so-called polar representation [15]

aai (q, q) = oak (q) q ki ,

with the orthogonal 3  3 matrix o parametrized
by the three angles q and the positive denite 3 3
symmetric matrix q. the three angles q are pure
gauge degress of freedom, which do not enter the
hamiltonian while their conjugated momenta are
vanishing according to the gauss law constraints.
the variables xi appearing in the hamiltonian (1)
are the eigenvalues of the positive denite symmet-
ric matrix q

q = rt ()d(x1, x2, x3)r() .

the angles  in the orthogonal matrix r() and
their canonical momenta are combined in the
killing vectors k . we emphasize that by de-
nition of the polar decomposition the diagonal el-
ements xi are positive denite which has impor-
tant consequences on the quantum level, as will be
shown below.

the transition to the corresponding quantum
hamiltonian is free of operator ordering ambigu-
ities. the operators ji = rijj corresponding to
the right-invariant so(3) killing vectors commute
with the hamilton operator.
its eigenstates can
therefore be classied according to the quantum
numbers j and m as eigenvalues of the total spin
~j 2 and its projection j3. we shall consider here
only the spin zero sector, ~j 2 = ~2 = 0, for which
the schrodinger eigenvalue problem reduces to

for the hermiticity of the hamiltonian h0 dened
in (2) the wave functions have to satisfy the bound-
ary conditions

the potential in (2) has three at valleys of zero
energy, x1 = x2 = 0 and x3 arbitrary, and the two
others obtained from this by cyclic permutation.
close to the bottom of the valleys the potential is
that of a harmonic oscillator with a width narrow-
ing down for larger values of x3.

one of the main results known for such a prob-
lem is that it has been proven to have a discrete
spectrum due to quantum uctuations [4] [5], al-
though the classical problem allows for scattering
trajectories. based on the well-known operator in-
equality 1

where 0 = 2.3381 is the rst zero of the airy
function. we shall see in this letter that there exist
nonseparable solutions which have an energy below
(6).

to obtain an upper bound e for the groundstate
energy e0 of the hamiltonian the most powerful
tool is the rayleigh-ritz variational technique [18],
based on the minimization of energy functional

e[] := (cid:10)|h0|(cid:11)
(cid:10)|(cid:11)

.

(7)

guided by the harmonic oscillator form of the val-
leys of the potential in (2) close to there bottom
a simple rst choice for a trial function compat-
ible with the boundary conditions (3) and (4) is
to use the lowest state of three harmonic quantum
oscilators on the positive half line

it follows that

h  .

(5)

since the hamiltonian h 
is known [4] to have
a discret spectrum, this is true also for h0. an
important open question is at which energy the
groundstate is. the well-known nonnormalizable
zero energy solution e=0 := a exp[gx1x2x3]
[16], [17], does not satisfy the necessary boundary
condition (3). however this does not exclude the
possibility for the existence of a true zero-energy
groundstate. the knowledge of the groundstate
energy of h 
in inequality (5) would provide a
lower bound for the groundstate energy of h0. due
to the additive structure of the potential term in
h  one can make a separable ansatz for the solu-
tion of the corresponding eigenvalue problem. the
energy of the lowest such separable h  eigenstate
satisfying the above boundary conditions (3) and
(4) is

lead to the isotropic optimal choice

 := 1 = 2 = 3 = 31/3g2/3 .

(9)

as a rst upper bound for the groundstate energy
of the hamiltonian we therefore nd

e0  e[000] =

31/3g2/3 = 4.8676 g2/3.

this upper bound is in agreement with the lower
bound of the energy functional for separable func-
tions

(10)

obtained from the operator inequality (5) and the
lower bound (6) for separable solutions of h .

in order to improve the upper bound for the
groundstate energy of the hamiltonian h0 we ex-
tend the space of trial functions (8) and consider
the fock space of the orthonormal set of the prod-
ucts

we therefore have the following irreducible repre-
sentations. the singlet states (0)+, the axial
singlet states (0), the doublets ((+1)+; (1)+)
and the axial doublets ((+1); (1)). since
the partner states of the doublets transform into
each other under the symmetry operations p12 or
t , the corresponding values of the energy func-
tional are equal.

e[(1)+
and e[(1)

due to this decomposition of the fock space
into the irreducible sectors, the variational ap-
proach allows us to give upper bounds for states
in each sector. the values of the energy functional
for the states in each irreducible sector with the
000 ] = 4.8676g2/3,
012 ] = 2.7756g2/3,
] = 13.0802g2/3 give rst upper
bounds for the lowest energy eigenvalues of the sin-
glet, the doublet, the axial singlet, and the axial
doublet states. the fact that the energy of the ax-
ial singlet state (0)
lies below the upper bound
012
(10) for separable solutions shows that the ground-
state of the hamiltonian h  in (5) is lower in en-
ergy than all separable solutions.

012

in order to improve the upper bounds for each
irreducible sector, we truncate the fock space at
a certain number of knots of the wave functions
and and search for the corresponding states in the
truncated space with the lowest value of the en-
ergy functional. we achieve this by diagonalizing
the corresponding truncated hamiltonian htrunk
to nd its eigenvalues and eigenstates. due to the
orthogonality of the truncated space to the remain-
ing part of fock space the value of the energy func-
tional (7) for the eigenvectors of htrunk coincides
with the corresponding eigenvalues. truncating af-
ter the rst few states in each sector we nd, that
the states

with the frequency xed by (9). furthermore the
variational procedure becomes enormously more
eective, if the space of trial functions is decom-
posed into the irreducible representations of the
residual discrete symmetries of the hamiltonian
(2). it is invariant under arbitrary permutations
of any two of the variables pijxi = xj pij, pij pi =
pjpij and under time reections t xi = xit, t pi =
pit ,

[h0, pij ] = 0,

[h0, t ] = 0 .

we shall represent these by the permutation oper-
ator p12, the cyclic permutation operator p123 and
the time reection operator t , whose action on the
states is

p123(x1, x2, x3) = (x2, x3, x1) ,
p12(x1, x2, x3) = (x2, x1, x3) ,
t (x1, x2, x3) = (x1, x2, x3) ,

and decompose the fock space spanned by the
functions (11) into the irreducible representations
of the permutation group s3 and time reection t .
for given (n1, n2, n3) we dene

however, the states (13) turn out not to be eigen-
states of the whole hamiltonian h0 but are lead
out of the truncated space by the action of h0.
truncating the fock space at a larger number of
knots of the wave functions, to include further
states in each irreducible sector, we nd two eigen-
states of the corresponding truncated hamiltonian
with zero value of the energy functional, but which
again are not eigenstates of the hamiltonian h0.
in the singlet sector, for example, including states
with oscillator quantum number up to 2, we nd
the additional state

with vanishing value of the energy functional prov-
ing that the energy functional is at least two-fold
degenerate in each sector. in general there exist
two possibilities, either from some nite number
of knots on, no further zero-eigenvalue state of the
corresponding truncated hamiltonian appears or
the procedure carries on to innity.
in the rst
case there exist linear superpositions of states with
zero energy functional, which solve the schrodinger
equation (2) with zero energy, by construction sat-
isfy the necessary boundary conditions (3) and (4)
and are normalizable. in the other case of innite
degeneracy of the energy functional, according to
the variational principle, superpositions of possibly
innitely many states with zero energy functional
should exist, which are zero-energy eigenstates of
the schrodinger equation (2) and satisfy the nec-
essary boundary conditions. however in the case
of innite degeneracy the question of convergency
and normalizability remains open.
it is in order
to remark here that our calculation indicates in-
nite degeneracy of the energy functional. note
that even for the case of the appearance of a non-
normalizable solution, it will satisfy the necessary
boundary conditions, in contrast to the false zero-
energy solution mentioned above.

finally we point out the (anti-)symmetry of the
states (13) and (15) under interchange of the os-
cillator quantum numbers 0 and 1. we speculate
here that excited states might correspond to su-
perposition of similar states with such symmetry
in the oscillator numbers 1 and 2, 2 and 3 and so
on.
