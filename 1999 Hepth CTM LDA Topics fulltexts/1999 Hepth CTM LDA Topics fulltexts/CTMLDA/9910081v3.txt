abstract

we propose a supergravity inspired derivation of a randallsundrums type action
as an eective description of the dynamics of a brane coupled to the bulk through
gravity only. the cosmological constants in the bulk and on the brane appear at the
classical level when solving the equations of motion describing the bosonic sector of
supergravities in ten and eleven dimensions coupled to the brane. they are related to
physical quantities like the brane electric charge and thus inherit some of their physical
properties. the most appealing property is their quantization: in d extra dimensions,
brane goes like n and bulk like n 2/(2d). this dynamical origin also explains the
apparent ne-tuning required in the randallsundrum scenario. in our approach, the
cosmological constants are derived parameters and cannot be chosen arbitrarily; instead
they are determined by the underlying lagrangian. some of the branes we construct
that support cosmological constant in the bulk have supersymmetric properties: d3-
branes of type iib superstring theory provide an explicit example.

1 introduction

the coexistence of two hierarchical scales in particle physics is probably the most chal-
lenging puzzle to solve before hoping to construct a quantum theory of gravity. when the
schwarzchild radius (rsch = 2gn m/c2) of a system of mass m becomes of the same order as its
compton length (c = /mc), a quantum mechanical extension of general relativity is surely
needed. therefore the natural scale of quantum gravity is the planck mass,pc5/gn  1019

gev. understanding how, in such a theory, the tiny electroweak scale observed in experi-
mental particle physics can arise and be stabilized against radiative corrections constitutes
the so-called gauge hierarchy problem. in low energy supersymmetry [1], this vast disparity
in scales can be protected from quantum destabilization. however a more fundamental ex-
planation is certainly to be found in string theory and its latest developments. string theory
relates the string scale to two other fundamental scales, namely the gut scale connected
to gauge interactions, and the planck scale connected to the gravitational interaction. the
link between these two is the geometry of extra dimensions, which can lower both scales [2]
down to the tev range [3] and thus partially answer the gauge hierarchy problem, or at least
translate it into geometrical terms.

subsequent to studies of thin shells in general relativity [4] and their revival in a m-theory
context [57], randall and sundrum (rs) have recently proposed [8] a new phenomenological
mechanism for solving the gauge hierarchy problem, without requiring the extra dimension
to be particularly large or smallin fact it could be noncompact. an exponential hierarchy
is generated by the localization of gravity near a self-gravitating brane with positive tension,
obtained by solving einstein equations. the solution is a nonfactorizable metric, i.e., a
metric with an exponentially decaying warp factor [9] along the single extra dimension.
restricting the standard model to a second parallel brane with negative tension at some
distance in this transverse dimension, the electroweak scale in our world then follows from
a redshifting of the planck scale on the second brane. since the exponential suppression by
the redshift factor does not require an unnaturally large interbrane separation, the hierarchy
problem can be explained without ne tuning, and without requiring any special size for the
extra dimensions.

the cosmological implications of this scenario have been studied [10, 11], with emphasis
on the danger of placing the standard model on a brane with negative tension since, for
instance, the friedmann equation governing the expansion of the universe appears with a
wrong sign. a similar diculty is also faced [12] when trying to reproduce the unication
of gauge couplings. the original scenario can be modied [8,12,13] by maximizing the warp
factor on the standard model brane, which can be achieved if its tension is taken positive.
the two former problems are overcome but the electroweak scale seems now dicult to
accommodate. more recently it has been shown that the correct cosmological expansion can
be obtained if the second brane tension is negative, but not too much so [14]. thus the
rs scenario remains attractive, especially with regard to the possibility of an innite extra
dimension probed only by gravity. it is appealing that, despite a continuous kaluzaklein
spectrum without any mass gap, newtons law of gravity is still reproduced [8,13,15] within
the current experimental precision. ref. [16] also proposed explicit models where a mass gap

1

separates the massless graviton from its kk excitations while the yukawa type deviations
from the 4d newton law remain compatible with experimental bounds.

although the gravity localization mechanism seems to be specic to codimension one
branes, several works [15, 17] have managed to extend it by considering many intersecting
codimension one branes.1 oda and hatanaka et al. [19] also obtain solutions with a more
involved content of branes with a single one extra-dimension. in this context also, ref. [14]
nds a cosmological solution for the bulk and the branes inating at the same rate with a
time dependant planck mass. in that case, the hierarchy between the weak and the planck
scales is xed at the end of ination. .

undoubtedly, the localization of gravity by the rs mechanism has rich phenomenological
and cosmological consequences [1015, 1922]; but at the present stage it seems lacking in
generality, and it suers from apparently ad hoc ne-tunings required between the cosmo-
logical constants in the bulk and on the branes, in order to obtain a solution to einstein
equations. verlinde [23] has reexamined the rs scenario in superstring language and shown
that the warp factor can be interpreted as a renormalization group scaling. in the context
of the ads/cft correspondence, the extra dimension plays the role of the energy scale.

in this paper, we oer a derivation of the eective action used by rs, starting from a more
fundamental, string-inspired origin. recent works [5, 7, 24, 25] have studied the dynamics of
a brane-universe; here we propose an explicit embedding of the rs model in supergravity
theories and examine its physical implications, following refs. [16,26], which have previously
addressed this question at a more formal level. our starting point will be the bosonic action
of supergravity theories in ten or eleven dimensions. we emphasize that, instead of neglecting
various elds specic to these actions like the dilaton and some n-dierential forms, taking
them into account can lead to an eective description in terms of cosmological constants.
using p-brane solutions2, we construct such a description for codimension one branes, which
allows us to identify the eective cosmological constants with physical quantities like the
electric charge carried by the brane and its mass density on the worldvolume. since the
electric charge of a p-brane obeys a generalized dirac quantization rule, we are led to the
interesting conclusion that the cosmological constants are also quantized.

the advantage of this approach is that we derive the stress-energy tensor t, which is
needed to solve the einstein equations, starting from an action for fundamental elds, rather
than putting it in by hand. thus our t is on the same footing as the einstein tensor
itself, from the point of view of fundamentality. moreover we are able to generalize the
procedure to higher codimension brane-universes (e.g., 3-branes embedded in more than one
extra dimension), providing some of the rst such solutions. in this case the bulk energy is
no longer a cosmological constant, but depends on the distance from the brane.

1see also ref. [18] for a recent construction of warped compactication in two transverse dimensions.
2 the branes we construct are solution to the bosonic equations of motion and thus, as we will see later,

they are not necessarily supersymmetric even if they are embedded in a supergravity theory.

2 brane cosmological constant as a warp in an anti-de

sitter bulk

we begin with a review of the model studied by randall and sundrum [8]. this model is a
particular case of the ones proposed by chamblin and reall [6], in which a scalar eld was
coupling a dynamical brane to an embedding bulk. here we consider the restricted scenario
of a static brane embedded in a spacetime curved by a bulk cosmological constant bk. the
physics of this model is governed by the following action:

srs =z dp+1x ddyp|g| (cid:18) r

22  bk  brd(p|g| y)(cid:19) ,

(1)

where yi = 0 is the location of the brane in the transverse (extra dimensional) subspace
and g is the determinant of the metric, assumed to be factorizable, in this subspace. the
einstein equations derived from (1) when the transverse space is at are (greek indices
denote longitudinal coordinates,  = 0 . . . p  1 and latin indices are coordinates transverse
to the brane, i = 1 . . . d):

g = 2(cid:16)bk + brd(p|g| y)(cid:17) g ;
gij = 2bk gij .

(2)

(3)

randall and sundrum solved these equations in the case of a codimension one brane. with
the ansatz

the einstein equations reduce to

where primes denote derivatives with respect to the transverse coordinate y. for this system
of equations to admit a solution that matches the singular terms, a ne-tuning between bk
and br is necessary:

a(y) = f (|y|) and

where f is a regular function and the constant n is related to the brane cosmological constant
by: |n| = 2p/(2br),  being the sign of f (0)/f (0). a particular class of solutions that

will play an important role in our analysis corresponds to:

a(y) = (l + |y|/r)na

and

b(y) =

nan r1
l + |y|/r

,

(9)

where r and l are two positive constants. an appropriate change of coordinates brings
this solution to the form proposed by randall and sundrum [8]: dening x  = lnax and
y = sgn(y)nan ln(1 + |y|/(rl)), the metric reads:

ds2 = e2 sgn(na)|y /n | dx 2 + dy 2 .

(10)

if the brane located at the origin is identied as the planck brane of lykkenrandall
[13], an electroweak scale will be generated on the tev brane if and only if the power
na is negative, which corresponds to a positive cosmological constant on the planck brane.3
another motivation for requiring na < 0 comes from computing the four-dimensional eective
planck mass, m 2

p l = m 3r dy a2|b|, which is nite for na < 0 but diverges for na > 0.

figure 1. the boundary of an anti-de sitter of dimension p + 2 space is topologically s1  sp. in
the system of coordinates x and r, this boundary is located at r = 0 and r = : the piece at
innity is a p + 1-dimensional minkowskian space, while the horizon at r = 0 corresponds to the
union of a point and r  sp1. a codimension one brane embedded in this ads space acts as a
warp in the sense that it cuts a part of the bulk: a brane with a positive cosmological constant
cuts the vicinity of the boundary located at the innity, while a brane with a negative cosmological
constant removes the horizon at the origin.

we can make another dieomorphism that claries the geometry of the solution. dening

3this connection between the signs of na and br is specic to one transverse dimension. in section 4, we
will see that we can have na > 0 whereas br > 0. in any case, the discussion about the hierarchy problem
deals with the sign of na only.

r = r0(l + |y|/r)na, with r0 = |n|, we now obtain:
r (cid:19)2
dx2 +(cid:18) r0

r0(cid:19)2
ds2 =(cid:18) r

dr2 ,

(11)

where we see that the geometry of the bulk corresponds to an anti-de sitter space of radius
r0, or at least a slice of an anti-de sitter space, since the variable r ranges only over a part of
r. indeed, for na > 0, the range of variation of r is restricted to [lna, +), while for na < 0
this range becomes [0, lna]. although in both cases the whole ads space is covered in the
limit l  0, it is interesting to note which part is cut when l 6= 0. as we will argue in the
appendix, the boundary of an anti-de sitter space of dimension p + 2 space is topologically
s1  sp, and in the system of coordinates x and r, this boundary is located at r = 0 and
r = : the piece at innity is a p + 1-dimensional minkowskian space, while the horizon at
r = 0 corresponds to the union of a point and r sp. so the na < 0 case, which corresponds
to a positive cosmological constant br on the brane, removes the part at innity, while
the na > 0 case, i.e. br < 0, cuts the horizon at the origin. note that in the ads/cft
correspondence [27], a superconformal theory describes the dynamics of a brane near the
horizon of an ads space while this dynamics should become free near innity [28].

as presented, the model studied by randall and sundrum leaves one wondering whether
it can be derived from some more fundamental starting point.
in particular, the ad hoc
ne-tuning between the cosmological constants is rather mysterious and begs for a better
understanding. one suggestion is that this relation might arise from the requirement that
tadpole amplitudes are zero in the underlying string theory [11]. (see also ref. [29] for recent
progress about this question). here we will see the cosmological constants as eective pa-
rameters which cannot be chosen arbitrarily, so the ne-tuning problem is ameliorated. the
aim of this work is to motivate the rs model from a supersymmetry/superstring framework.

3 eective cosmological constants from dynamics of

codimension one branes

in this section, we would like to show that the theory derived from the action (1) can be
seen as an eective description of a brane of codimension one, i.e., of an extended object
with p spatial dimensions embedded in a (p + 2) dimensional spacetime.

the dynamics of an object extended in p spatial directions is governed by the general-

ization of the nambugoto action4 [30]:

where x (a) are the coordinates in the embedding spacetime of a point on the brane
characterized by its worldvolume coordinates a; mb is the scale mass in so-called p-brane

where ab is an auxiliary eld that gives the metric on the worldvolume.

(13)

superbranes have been constructed [32] as classical solutions of supergravity theories in
ten or eleven dimensions: they are bps objects, since they preserve half of the supersymme-
tries; they have a poincare invariance on their worldvolume universe and also a rotational
invariance in the transverse space. a p-brane is therefore coupled to the low-energy eective
theory of superstrings. below the fundamental energy scale, identied as the energy of the
rst massive excitations of the string, the theory can be described by supergravity theories
whose bosonic spectrum contains the metric, a scalar eld (the dilaton) and numerous dif-
ferential forms. the bosonic eective action, in supergravity units, takes the general form
(2 = m 2d):

sef f =z ddxp|g|(cid:18) 1

(p + 2)!

epf1...p+2f 1...p+2(cid:19) ,

(14)

where f1...p+2 = (p + 2) [1 a2...p+2] is the eld strength of the (p + 1)-dierential form
a, whose coupling to the dilaton is measured by the coecient p. the coecient p
is explicitly determined by a string computation: the coupling of the dilaton to dierential
forms from the ramond-ramond sector appears at one loop and thus rr
in supergravity units, while the neveu-schwarzneveu-schwarz two-form couples at tree
level, so n s
to the action, but it does not have any eect on the classical solutions.

p /22 = (3 p)/2
1 /22 = 1. in some cases, we can also add a chernsimons term (a f  f )

the p-brane couples to a (p + 1)-dierential form, which results in the addition of a

wesszumino term to the free action (13):

(15)

the functions g and ep implicitly depend on worldvolume coordinates  through their
dependence in the embedding coordinates x. the coecient p denes the p-brane units;
it is xed [33] by requiring the same scaling behavior for sef f and sp , which leads to

p

p = 

p + 1

.

(16)

the relation between mb and m then follows from the value of this coupling to the dilaton:
mb = e/(p+1)m,  being the vacuum expectation value of the dilaton.

to proceed, we must now relax some of the constraints imposed by supersymmetry,
while still maintaining the form of the action. for example in string theories, the values of

6

p and d are related to one another in order to have supersymmetry on the worldvolume
universe [34]. also, as just mentioned, the coupling to the dilaton is xed. by relaxing these
constraints, we give up any claim that the following construction is a direct consequence of
string theory. on the other hand it might be hoped that our results will persist in a realistic
low energy limit of string theory, which includes the eects of supersymmetry breaking.
in what follows, we will elucidate how the various elds, which play a crucial role for the
existence of branes in supergravity, can give rise to an eective stress-energy tensor which
resembles the cosmological constant terms needed for the randallsundrum scenario.

we will solve these equations in the case of a codimension one brane and we will see in

system of spacetime coordinates related to the brane:

transverse coordinate:

in the physical gauge where x () = .

we are looking for a solution with a poincare invariance in (p + 1) dimensions, so that

we can make the following ansatz for the metric:

ds2 = e2a(y)dx  dx + e2b(y)dy  dy .

where 1...p+1 is the antisymmetric tensor normalized to 1.
it is well known that (see for instance [33] for a review), corresponding to the ansatz
(2526), the solutions of eqs (1721) can be expressed in terms of a harmonic function h(y):

ds2 = h 2nx dx  dx  + h 2ny dy  dy ;

(33)

where l is an arbitrary positive constant that can be normalized to one if a at minkowski
space in the vicinity of the brane is wanted. at this stage, it is worth noticing that the
derivation follows directly from the bosonic equations (17)-(21) and no supersymmetric ar-
gument has been used. the full supergravity equations also include a killing spinor equation
that can be consistently solved, provided that the coupling of the dierential form to the
dilaton takes its stringy value. this promotes the bosonic solution to a bps one.

in the limit of decoupling between the brane and the dilaton, i.e., p = 0, which also
corresponds to ny = (p + 1)nx = 1 using the constraint (31), the einstein tensor involves
two constants

m p+2 ep and 

br = m p+1 ep/2 .

(38)

they can be interpreted as eective cosmological constants since the metric (27) is a solution
to the einstein equations derived from the rs action (1).

the expression of the cosmological constants in terms of fundamental planck mass in d
dimensions may give some insight into the origin of the apparently ad hoc ne-tuning (7) of
the rs mechanism: here the cosmological constants are no longer fundamental parameters
and the ne-tuning problem appears in a dierent way;
in the present language it is a
consequence of taking the limit where the dilaton decouples from the brane. of course this
represents just one point in the full parameter space. the more general solution, when
the dilaton does not decouple, is a bulk energy density which depends on y, rather than
a cosmological constant term. regardless of this dierence, one can still obtain a rapidly
decaying warp factor, as long as p remains small enough  the warp factor follows a power
law whose exponent is inversely proportional to p. the new insight, then, is that the
original rs solution is only the simplest possibility within a whole class of solutions which
can solve the hierarchy problem.

furthermore, our approach links the energy densities of the brane and bulk to physical

quantities like the charge, qe, associated to the electric current (23):

qe =zsdp2

ep  f =zsdp2

ep
aw z

h
y

2a2

w zm p+1 .

(39)

not only is such a charge conserved, but it also obeys diracs quantization rule [35]: solutions
exist where the ducial value of the electric charge is multiplied by an integer and these can

9

be interpreted as a superposition of n parallel branes. from the multiplication of the source
(15) by a factor n, we easily deduce the following scaling when disentangling the contribution
from the source and from the bulk in (34)(35)5:

bk  q2

e

and br  qe ,

(40)

which assures that bk and br are quantized like n 2

bk and n

br respectively.

a serious shortcoming with the above solution is that the dilaton decoupling regime
requires a purely imaginary wesszumino term (see eq. (31)), which implies an imaginary
hence unphysical value for the electric charge. let us consider what happens if we insist that
aw z be real-valued, which would happen if the dilaton coupling, p, was suciently large,
instead of zero as we previously assumed. in this case eq. (33) implies that the harmonic
form h(y) vanishes at some value of y, yh = l/c, where c = m p+1ep/2a2
w z/4. the
exponents nx and ny are positive, so the metric coecients vanish at y = yh; this indicates
the presence of a horizon surrounding the brane. the nontrivial dependence on y of the
brane metric coecient, e2a(y), means that the compactication is still warped; however it
is not an exponential warp factor as in the solution of randall and sundrum. this can be
seen by transforming to the coordinate dy = eb(y)dy, which measures physical distance in
the bulk. in this coordinate, e2a(y) = (l1+ny  c(ny + 1)y)2nx/(1+ny).
if we now imagine placing a visible sector brane (with such small tension that it has
negligible eect on the background geometry [13]) very close to the horizon, physical masses
on that brane will be suppressed relative to the string scale by the small factor e2a(y).
however one must ne-tune the closeness of the brane to the horizon to get particles of
weak-scale masses, so this does not provide a natural solution to the weak-scale hierarchy
problem.

because of the imaginary value of aw z required for the solution which corresponds to
that of randall and sundrum, our construction is still just a tantalizing hint at a stringy
origin for their proposal. to be more convincing, it is essential to overcome this problem.
in the next section, we will adress this issue by going to a higher number of (still non co-
pact) extra dimensions, in the space transverse to the brane. however, it may happen that
the problem of the imaginary wesszumino coupling also disappears when considering the
compactication of some of these extra dimensions, requiring a more complete analysis in-
volving some interacting moduli elds in gauged supergravity theories6. the problem should
also be reconsidered in a more complicated version [36] of ten dimensional iia supergravity
including mass terms since a codimension one supersymmetric object, the d-8 brane, has
been constructed by bergshoe et al. [37]. this subject was partially addressed in the recent
references [38].

in summary, our study of codimension one branes suggests that the cosmological con-
stants introduced by randall and sundrum are an eective description of the dynamics of

5it is important to notice that the singular part of the einstein tensor depends in the source not only

through the powers of h but also intrinsically.

discussion.

a more complicated set of elds governing the physics of a brane that couples to the bulk
through gravitational interactions only. thus those eective cosmological constants inherit
some physical properties of the brane, an intriguing one being their quantization. we point
out that, for codimension one branes with no dilaton coupling, the solution (27) belongs to
the general class of solutions (9). since the exponent na = nx = 1/(p + 1) is negative,
it follows from the general discussion of section 2 that this eld conguration has an expo-
nential decaying warp factor and thus can solve the gauge hierarchy problem in the manner
proposed by lykken and randall [13]. namely, physical particle masses will be exponentially
suppressed on any test-brane (tev brane) placed suciently far from the planck brane
featured in our solution.

4 generalization to higher codimension brane-universe

we would now like to generalize the previous results to the case of a brane-universe of
codimension greater than one. requiring rotational invariance in the transverse space, the
ansatz for the metric and for the (p + 1)-dierential form will be a function only of the
distance r in the transverse space:

the solutions (2729) take the same form, but the powers are now given by:

r =pyiyj ij .

nx = 

2(d  2)2
(p + d  1)a2

w z

ny =

2(p + 1)2
(p + d  1)a2

w z

n =

p
a2

w z

,

(41)

(42)

and the relation between the wesszumino coupling and the dilaton coupling becomes:

w z = 22 (p + 1)(d  2)
a2
(p + d  1)
the function h is harmonic in the transverse space:

h  ij 2h

yiyj =  1

the rotational invariant solution is

h = l + a2

w zm p+1

(43)

(44)

(45)

where l is an arbitrary constant and d1 is the volume of sd1. (when d = 1 the sphere
degenerates into two points, giving 0 = 2.) the case of a brane of codimension two involves
logarithmic behavior, and we will not specify it in the following. whatever the value of l is,
(45) gives a solution to the equations of motion, however the solution associated to l = 0 has
enhanced symmetry properties. moreover, as we will now demonstrate, when the dilaton

11

decouples from the brane, the geometry of this l = 0 solution can be derived from eective
cosmological constants. indeed the components of the einstein tensor associated with the
solution (45) are

g = 

gij =

w z (cid:18)1 
w z(cid:19) h 2(ny+1) (h )2g

g ;

when the dilaton decouples, p = 0, implying nx = 1/(p + 1) and ny = 1/(d  2), the
metric can then be written as:

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

with

ds2 =(cid:18) r

r0(cid:19)2(d2)/(p+1)
r0m =(cid:18)

r (cid:19)2
dx  dx  +(cid:18) r0
(p + d  1)d1(cid:19)1/(d2)

p + 1

ep/(2d4) .

dyi  dyj ij .

this is the geometry of adsp+2  sd1; r0 is the radius of the sphere and it is related to
the radius of the ads space by r0 = rads(d  2)/(p + 1). the expression of the einstein
tensor simplies to:

bk + 

g = 2(cid:18)
bk(cid:18)2
gij = 2

br

d(y)

g (cid:19) g ;
0  gij(cid:19) ;

yiyj

where the constants 

bk and 

br are given by:

(50)

(51)



br = m p+1ep/2 ;



bk =

d  2

(cid:18)p + d  1

p + 1 (cid:19)d/(d2)

2/(d2)

d1 m p+d+1ep/(d2) .

(52)

what allows us to interpret them as eective cosmological constants is the fact that the
metric (48) is actually a solution to the einstein equations derived from a generalized rs
action:

s =z dp+1x ddyp|g|


22  bk g(cid:18) r
r

r0(cid:19)2d!1

r0(cid:19)2
(cid:18) r

 br

d(y)

g 
 ;

(53)

where r is dened by r2 = yiyjgij . it is noteworthy that when the metric in the transverse
space is integrated out, i.e., xed to the solution of its equation of motion, the action (53)
reduces to the one introduced by rs.

12

in the expression (52), we notice that even if the power na = (d  2)/(p + 1) is positive,
the cosmological constant on the brane is positive. along the discussion of the section 2, this
would not be the case with only one extra dimension, but when d > 1 the extra transverse
dimensions that live on the sphere also contribute to the singularity in the einstein tensor and
modify the singularity coming from the ads part of the space. nevertheless, our discussion
of the hierarchy problem is unaected by the spherical extra dimensions and thus a positive
power na is undesirable as regards the gauge hierarchy problem, since it implies that the
integral for the 4d eective planck mass diverges. however a positive power na naturally
generates a gauge coupling unication along the lines of the scenario proposed in [12].

just as in the case of codimension one, the eective cosmological constants are related

to the charge qe associated to the electric current (23):

bk  q2/(2d)

e

and

  qe ,

(54)

which leads to their quantization in the multibrane conguration: br goes to n
goes to n 2/(2d) 

br and bk

bk .

not only does going to higher codimension brane-universes cure the problem of the imag-
inary wesszumino term, but they can also be more easily embedded in a superstring frame-
work. as we have seen, the theory dened by sef f +sp admits a p-brane solution only when
the two couplings p and aw z are related by eq. (31) that denes a line in the parameter
space. on this line, one point, p = 0, has an eective description in terms of cosmological
constants in the bulk and on the brane. on the other hand, there is another point where the
p-brane is supersymmetric, the couplings taking their stringy values. the two points may
coincide as it is the case for the d-3 brane in type iib theory or for the branes of m-theory
since they do not couple to the dilaton. at this stage, it would be interesting to incorporate
in the eld theoretical analysis of rs some stringy corrections to the supergravity action,
like quadratic terms in curvarture, for instance, since they can modify the spectrum of the
kaluzaklein gravitons excitations.

5 discussion

in this work we have presented solutions to the coupled equations for branes in d extra
dimensions and the low energy bosonic states of supergravity or superstring theories. the
goal was to reproduce the eective stress-energy tensor needed for the randall-sundrum
solution which uses gravitational trapping to solve the weak scale hierarchy problem. let us
summarize the results.

decoupled dilaton regime

regardless of the dimensionality of the tranvserse space, we nd that the stress-energy tensor
takes a simple form only in the limit that the dilaton eld decouples from the brane. then
there are three cases:

13

d = 1.

it is necessary to go to an unphysical value of the wess-zumino coupling,
a2
w z < 0, to obtain a solution, which does however then yield exactly the bulk and brane
cosmological constants needed for the rs proposal.

leading to trivial solutions.

d = 2. this appears to be an uninteresting case, because aw z is forced to vanish,
d > 2. we now nd solutions with positive bk and physically acceptable values
a2
w z > 0 for the wess-zumino coupling. some of the solutions are supersymmetric and are
identied as the usual branes of string theories. the bulk energy term looks conventional
(constant) in the brane components of t, but it has a mild dependence on the bulk coordi-
nates in the tranvserse components, tij. the warp factor a(y ) goes like exp(+const|y |) in
coordinates where y represents the physical distance from the brane in the bulk (const > 0).
therefore the solution cannot be advocated to explain the hierarchy between the planck
and electroweak scales. this is in qualitative agreement with the d = 2 solution recently
found in ref. [18]. it would therefore appear that the rs solution to the hierarchy problem
works only in the case of a single extra dimension7, or in the case of several intersecting
branes of codimension one. on the other hand, as shown in ref. [12], despite innitely large
extra dimensions, gauge coupling unication can naturally arise as a result of the anomaly
associated with the rescaling of the wave functions on the brane. moreover the presence of
the spherical extra dimensions can help to cure some phenomenological puzzles which occur
when there is only one transverse dimension, such as electroweak symmetry breaking and
obtaining small enough neutrino masses [12].

coupled dilaton regime

it is interesting to also consider the solutions where the dilaton does not decouple from the
brane. the bulk energy is no longer constant in these solutions, so the resulting stress-
energy tensor does not have the simple form proposed by rs. nevertheless, these solutions
are equally acceptable and may have interesting physical consequences.

d = 1. it is now possible to have a real-valued wess-zumino coupling and in this regime

the metric develops a horizon at a nite distance from the brane.

d = 2. the solutions are no longer trivial, but have a logarithmic dependence on the

bulk coordinate. we have not studied this special case in detail.

d > 2. the term in t which looked like a bulk cosmological constant when the
dilaton coupling vanished now has nontrivial spatial dependence in the bulk. such behavior
has recently been proposed as a condition for avoiding the generic problem of the incorrect
friedmann equation for the expansion of the brane [39].
in the latter, complicated and
a priori unmotivated expressions for the dependence of t55 on y were derived using the
requirement of correct cosmological expansion. although we have not yet found inationary
solutions in the present context, it would be interesting to do so in order to check whether
the y dependence of t55 advocated in ref. [39] can be justied by the presence of nontrivial
dilaton elds.

7numerical solutions which we have found in the case of d = 2 also support this conclusion.

appendix: the boundary of an anti-de sitter space

an anti-de sitter space of dimension p + 2 can be seen as a hypersurface embedded in a
at space of signature (2,p + 1). let x,  = 0 . . . p + 2, be some coordinate system in this
embedding space. the anti-de sitter space of radius r is dened by the equation:

xx  x0x0 + x1x1 + . . . xp+1xp+1  xp+2xp+2 = r2

(55)

and the metric on ads is the embedding metric.
dened by

r

x  =

xp+1 + xp+2 x ,  = 0 . . . p,

in a convenient system of coordinates

and

r = xp+1 + xp+2 ,

(56)

the embedding metric factorizes:

ds2 =(cid:16) r
r(cid:17)2

r(cid:19)2
 dx   dx  +(cid:18) r

dr  dr .

(57)

the boundary of ads is the set of points that satises equation (55) at the innity of the
at space. more precisely, we can rescale the coordinates x  x h = x and consider the
limit   . the boundary is thus dened by the projective equations
x 0x 0 + x 1x 1 + . . . + x p+1x p+1  x p+2x p+2 = 0
x   x  with   r \ {0} ,

(58)
(59)

which clearly describe s1  sp. in the system of coordinates (56), the set of solutions to the
boundary equations has two disconnected pieces: the rst one is associated with r 6= 0, which
is sent to r =  by the rescaling, and it corresponds to a minkowski space of dimension p + 1
spanned by x0 . . . xp; the second piece is associated with r = 0, i.e. r = 0, and corresponds
to the union of a point and r  sp1.
