abstract

we investigate the eective dynamics of an arbitrary dirichlet p-brane, in a path-integral
formalism, by incorporating the massless excitations of closed string modes in open bosonic
string theory.
it is shown that the closed string background elds in the bosonic sector of
type iib induce invariant extrinsic curvature on the world-volume. in addition, the curvature
can be seen to be associated with a divergence at the boundary of the string world-sheet. the
renormalization of the collective coordinates, next to the leading order in its derivative expansion,
is performed to handle the divergence and the eective dynamics is encoded in the dirac-born-
infeld action. futhermore, the collective dynamics is generalized to include the appropriate
fermionic partners in type i super-string theory. the role of zero modes is reviewed in terms of
the collective coordinates and the gauge theory on the world-voulme is argued to be non-local
in presence of the u (1) invariant eld.

introduction

in super-string theory, most of the non-perturbative insights have been analyzed by investigat-

ing various features of dirichlet p-brane (dp-brane), where p denotes the number of spatial

dimensions. since strings are coupled to the non-trivial background elds through conformal

symmetry, a systematic study [1] of the dp-brane involves arbitrary type ii string backgrounds

and have been in focus since its inception as the ramond-ramond (rr) charge carriers [2].

among various aspects of the dp-brane, one of the important is the dp-brane dynamics. sev-

eral investigations in this direction have been discussed using dierent techniques [3]. in general,

the world-volume gauge theory can be seen as an approximation to the underlying open string

theory [4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

in this context, a path-integral formalism to deal with the collective

dynamics of a d-particle (d0) [9] and subsequently for a d-string (d1) [10, 11] were developed.

from a microscopic point of view, the dp-brane is characterized by the (p + 1)-dimensional

hyper-surfaces with open string ending on it [4]. thus, the u (1) gauge eld associated with

the ends of the open string contribute towards the world-volume dynamics of the dp-branes. in

fact, the world-volume gauge eld gives rise to the extra degrees of freedom unlike the green-

schwarz (fundamental) string. these extra states are essentially the massive states of the open

string and can be seen to be responsible for the non-local description on the world-voulme of

the dp-branes. to a tree level approximation in string theory, the gauge theory on the world-
volume of a dp-brane is a yang-mills theory. the next order in  expansion gives rise to the
born-infeld action [5] and describes the world-volume dynamics of the dp-branes. in general,
the born-infeld action incorporates corrections to all orders in  and the exact dynamics of

a dp-brane still remains unanswered. though dp-branes are bps objects in string theory, in

most of the investigations related to its dynamics, bosonic branes are considered. nevertheless,

the formulation of the super-symmetric dp-brane dynamics play an important role and has been

worked out [12] in great detail in the type ii closed string theories.

in this paper, we extend our previous analysis [11] for a d-string (p = 1) in presence of closed

string backgrounds to an arbitrary dp-brane. in addition, we consider the appropriate super-

partners in the present context and study the dp-brane world-volume geometry. we perform the
analysis for the dp-branes in type iia or iib2 super-string theory where they play a natural role
due to their rr charges. for deniteness, we consider a dp-brane, with odd p (= 1, 3, 5, . . .)

in the bosonic sectors (ns-ns and rr) of type iib closed string theory. the result for the even

p (= 0, 2, 4 . . .) dp-brane of type iia can be formally obtained from that of type iib dp-brane

2p takes even value for type iia and odd in case of type iib.

1

by screening the kalb-ramond (kr) potential in the ns-ns sector. it can be seen that the

induced metric gives rise to the curvature on the world-volume. in case of type iib super-string,

the kr potential can also be seen to induce additional curvature on the world-volume of the

dp-brane. in any case (even or odd p), the induced (extrinsic) curvature on the world-volume

of the dp-brane and makes it a curved one.

we plan to present an explicit computation for an arbitrary bosonic dp-brane in (oriented)

open string theory. the duality of the world-sheet can be used to interprete the open string

result in the type ii closed string theories. we take into account the derivative expansion of
the collective coordinates next to leading order in  and the eective dynamics can be seen to

be that of the dirac-born-infeld (dbi). in fact, the eld contents in the ns-ns sector of the

type iib closed string and that of the oriented open bosonic string are identical. the remaining

elds in the rr sector act as sources for the dp-brane and determine its charges. obtaining the

eective dynamics for the bosonic dp-brane, we generalize the formalism to a super-symmetric

case by considering appropriate fermionic partners for open string coordinates as well as for

the collective coordinates. to perform the computations, we consider type i open super-string

(un-oriented, n = 1 super-symmetry) [13, 14], and present necessary steps for the fermionic part

to make the presentation concise. in other words, we investigate the wolrd-volume dynamics of

an arbitrary dp-brane, with the generic type ii string backgrounds, in open string channel. the

presence of background elds can be seen to be a deformation [15] of the dp-brane world-volume

and the non-commutative geometry [16, 17] shows up naturally at the boundary of the open

strings [18]. we investigate the induce geometry due to the zero modes of the open string at its

boundary and conclude with a note on the non-local description of gauge theory on the dp-brane

world-volume.

2 open string uctuations on a p-brane

it is known that the eective dynamics of a dp-brane is due to the uctuations governed by the

end of the open super-string (whose world-sheet is a disk) with appropriate boundary conditions.

for instance, dirichlet boundary conditions in the transverse directions dene the position of

the dp-brane and the remaining (p + 1)-directions satisfy the neumann conditions along the

world-volume.

to begin with, consider an arbitrary dp-brane (p = 1, 2, . . .), characterized by its space-time
coordinates f (t, i), for (i = 1, . . . , p) with lorentzian signature (, +, +, . . . +), in presence
of closed string background elds. the bosonic dp-brane sub-manifold (world-volume) may be

2

seen as an embedding in space-time ( = 0, 1, . . . , p, p + 1, . . . , 25). at the disk boundary3 ,

the lorentz covariant condition becomes [4]

x () = f (t(), i()) ,

(1)

where x (z, z) is the open string coordinates parameterized by the polar angle  with (0   
2) on .

the interaction of the dp-brane (for odd p) with the massless excitations of closed
string; namely metric, g , kr antisymmetric two-form potential,4 b and the dilaton, ,
can be described in open string theory by a non-trivial generalization of our earlier formulations

[10, 11] for a d-string. it is known that the open string possesses a u (1) gauge eld a(x)

in space-time and can also be seen as a requirement for the consistency of the closed string

kr potential [19]. the background gauge eld interacts with the open string at its boundary

where as the closed string background elds interact in bulk. then the non-linear sigma model

describing the dynamics of the open string can be written [20] for a constant dilaton, in a

conformal gauge, as

s[x, a, b] =

1

4 z

d2z (cid:16) g (x)ax ax   i ab b (x)ax bx  (cid:17)

+ i z 

d g (x)a(x) x  .

(2)

the eective dynamics for the dp-branes can be taken into account by generalizing the path-

integral [21, 9, 10] in presence of the curved background elds [11]. in fact, we make use of the

polyakov path-integral formulation [22] to describe the generalized dynamics of the dp-branes.

at low energy, the eective action for the dp-brane can be obtained from the renormalized

non-linear sigma model partition function which is the disk amplitude modulo the massless

closed string vertex operator. in this formalism, the eective dynamics can be generalized from

refs.[10, 11] and becomes

se(cid:16)f, a, b(cid:17) =

1

gs z dx (z)dt() di() (cid:16) x ()  f (t(), i()) (cid:17)  exp(cid:16)  s[x, a, b] (cid:17) ,

(3)
where gs = e is the closed string coupling constant. the -function in eq.(3) takes care of
the dirichlet boundary conditions and hence responsible for the dp-brane description. the

path-integral (3) needs to be evaluated in bulk as well as at the boundary, to obtain non-linear

dynamics of a dp-brane.

3for convenience, we compute for the bosonic string. appropriate fermionic partners shall be introduced at a

later point in section 8.

4 for even p, similar analysis holds by setting b = 0 in the ns-ns sector (type iia),which is the case for

non-oriented open string.

3 curvatures on the dp-brane world-volume

the background elds can be seen to induce curvatures on the (p + 1)-dimensional world-volume

of a dp-brane. the induced elds can be expressed in terms of the dp-brane collective coordi-
nates, f (t, i), and become

hab = g (x) af bf  ,

bab = b (x) af bf 

and

cabc... = c...(x) af bf cf  . . . ,

(4)

where hab, bab and cabc... for (a, b, c, . . . = 0, 1, 2 . . . , p) are respectively the metric, kr two-form

and the rr (p + 1)-form induced on the dp-brane. this in turn leads to the extrinsic curvature,

k, on the dp-brane world-volume and makes it a curved one. the induced rr forms mixes with

the kr form in a gauge invariant way and the source term describes a (p + 2)-dimensional sub-

manifold with its boundary representing the world-volume of the dp-brane. for a generalized

dp-brane, the boundary value of the wess-zumino (wz)-action can be given by [23]

sw z(f, c) = qp z dt dp e(b+ f )  c ,

(5)

where qp denotes the p-brane charge density and the rr potential, c, takes the appropriate
forms with the invariant u (1) eld strengths.5 the extrinsic curvature of a dp-brane in presence
of arbitrary backgrounds of type ii string theory depends on the induced metric and kr two-

form elds and can be expressed as

k 
ab = p  abf ,
k 
abc = abcf   a

(6)

where  is the christoel connection and h (= db) denotes the eld strength corresponding
to the kr two-form. p  denotes the normal projected space and can be expressed in terms of
the tangential space h :

where

p  = g + b  h ,
h = (cid:16)hab + bab(cid:17) af bf  .

(7)

in order to perform the boundary path-integrals, the brane coordinates f (t(), i()) can be
re-written in its derivative expansion around its center of mass coordinate f (t, i). the appro-
5the eective action obtained by path-integrating eq.(3) along with the wz action (5) play a vital role in the

super-symmetric formulation

4

priate geodesic expansion [24] for the (p + 1)-dimensional world-volume becomes

f  ( t(), i() ) = f (t, i) + af (cid:16)t(), i()(cid:17) a() +

abc a() b() c() + o( 4) ,

(8)

where  a() are the normal coordinates dened on the world-volume of a p-brane. the expansion

for a p-brane takes the similar form as the case of d-string [10]. however the explicit form of

the curvature (6) is much involved with geometry due to the additional three-form eld strength

habc.

to leading order in the expansion (8), the boundary of the disk is mapped on to a

point (t, i) on the (p + 1)-dimensional world-volume. then, an orthonormal frame [9, 10, 11]

can be set up at that point to simplify the computation. as a consequence, the sub-leading

terms in eq.(8), become the quantum uctuations in this frame. in addition, the basis vectors,
e
a , (a = 0, 1, . . . p) span the (p + 1)-dimensional tangential space and satisfy the neumann
boundary conditions. the remaining unit vectors, e
, ( = p + 1, . . . , 25) lie in a transverse

space with dirichlet boundary conditions. they can be expressed for a = (a, ) as

a = n(a) e

where ab and eab are the at backgrounds representing the minkowskian metric and the kr

space and satisfy

n 2
(a) n 2

(b) =  h ,

(10)

where h = det hab and the normalizations in the transverse space are denoted as n() =
(1, 1, . . . 1).

4 boundary conditions for non-zero modes

in order to simplify the computation, we separate out the zero mode x from the string coordi-
nate, x (z, z) = x + (z, z). then the non-zero mode  can be expressed in terms of the

5

orthonormal coordinates a(z, z):

(z, z) = xa

e
a a(z, z) ,

(11)

where a(z, z) and (z, z) correspond to the components in tangential and transverse spaces

respectively.

the background elds, namely metric g (x), kr two-form b (x) and the u (1) gauge

eld a(x) can also be expanded around their zero-modes:

g (x) =  + g  + . . . ,

b(x) =  + b  + . . .

and

a(x) = a +

1
2

f  + . . . ,

(12)

where  is the at metric.  and a are the constant modes for the antisymmetric two-form

and gauge eld respectively. for a constant eld strength fab on the (p + 1)-dimensional world-

volume, the non-linear sigma model action (2) simplies drastically in the orthonormal frame

and becomes [11]

s[, b, a] =

1

4h z

d2z a2a + z 

d (cid:16) ana

a and
ba. then the boundary conditions for the non-zero modes of the open string can be

where n denotes the normal derivative, bab  b e
ab  e
derived from the above eq.(13) and can be given as

+ i n(a)n(b) (cid:0)bab + fab (cid:1) ab (cid:17) ,
b, fab  2 fab, a  e

ae

(13)

and

na() + i n(a)n(b) (cid:0)bab + fab(cid:1) b() = 0

() = 0 ,

(14)

where (bab + fab) is the invariant u (1) eld strength on the world-volume of an arbitrary
dp-brane.6

5

integration over string modes

the eective dynamics of the dp-brane can be obtained by performing the path-integrations

in bulk as well as over the boundary elds. let us consider the path-integral over the string modes

6in section 7, we analyze the boundary conditions to view some of the interesting features of the world-volume

dynamics

6

a(z, z) uniformly in bulk. in the orthonormal frame, the path-integral can be dealt separately

over the transverse and the longitudinal components. the path-integral over the transverse

components, , is a gaussian and can be seen to be trivial using the dirichlet boundary

conditions (14). thus the computation is essentially reduced to that over the longitudinal

components a. it can be expressed as

i l

 (|z|  1) azbi (cid:17)  exp(cid:16) iz

d2z (|z|  1) a(z) a(z) (cid:17) ,

(15)

where (|z|  1) a(z) = a() denote the lagrange multiplier elds due to the boundary condi-
tions in eq.(1). the above gaussian integral (15) is straightforward to perform and one obtains

i l

 = [jacobian]  exp(cid:16) 

2 z d d a() gab(, ) b() ab (cid:17) ,

(16)

where gab(, ) denotes the neumann propagator on the boundary of an unit disk. the matrix
propagator satises

2gab(z, z) = 2 ab (2)(z, z)

in bulk

and ngab(z, z) + i n(a)n(b) (cid:0)bab + fab(cid:1) gab(z, z) = 0

on  .

(17)

finally, the expressions in eq.(17) are analyzed and the explicit form for the (p + 1) dimensional

square (orthogonal) matrix propagator can be expressed as

gab(z, z) = ab ln|z  z| +

1

2   1  n(a)n(b)(cid:0)b + f(cid:1)

z z(cid:19) . (18)

the eect of the u (1) gauge eld can be seen as a lorentz rotation with respect to the one of

vanishing gauge eld. on the boundary , the diagonal part of the propagator matrix diverges
as . we regularize the propagator by introducing a cut o  [13]
en



gaa(, ) = 2 aa h (cid:2)h  det(cid:0)bab + fab(cid:1)(cid:3)1

(19)

in the limit   , the propagator gaa(, ) can be seen to contain a divergence and is given

gaa(, ) = 2aa h (cid:2)h  det(cid:0)bab + fab(cid:1)(cid:3)1 ln  .

(20)

7

on the other hand, the jacobian in eq.(16) can be written as

[jacobian] = (cid:16) dethab 2 + n(a)n(b)(cid:0)bab + fab(cid:1) (|z|  1)zi (cid:17) 1

2 .

using the fourier mode expansion on a boundary circle, the jacobian can be re-expressed as

(21)

[jacobian] =

the zeta-function regularization can be performed and one obtains





xn=1

xn=1

finally, the jacobian for the path-integral in bulk reduces to a simple form:

.

(22)

(23)

(24)

[jacobian] =

1

h (cid:0) h + b + f (cid:1)

1
2 ,

where h + b + f = det(hab + bab + fab). since the computation of disk amplitude is modulo
the massless closed string modes, the jacobian obtained (24) is the only contribution from the
bulk as a whole and corresponds to an exact (in ) result.

6

integration over boundary elds

now, we are in a position to perform the path-integral over the boundary elds a() and
 a() by assembling the relevant terms. the path-integral over the lagrange multiplier eld

a() can be expressed as an gaussian and thus straight-forward to perform. the complexity is

due to the curvatures and the source term can be explicitly expressed as

ja() = n 1

(25)

(26)

as can be analyzed from the source term (25), to o(), the a()-integral contains a
quartic interaction term apart from the quadratic part. in order to simplify the calculation, we

make use of a re-scaling [10] for an arbitrary p-brane :

 a() =  n(a)

 a() .

(27)

the corresponding change in the functional measure is calculated by using the fourier mode

expansion and the zeta-function regularization. it can be expressed as

d a() =  (p+1)

2

p

x(a6=b)=0

n 1
(a) n 1

(b) d  a() .

(28)

the quartic interaction term in the  a()-integral can be simplied drastically by using

the propagator

 a() b() = ab g(, ) .

(29)

after some calculations, the path-integrated boundary part can be given by

i  () (p+1)

(30)

now the eective dynamics of a dp-brane can be obtained by considering the path-

integrated results in bulk (24) and boundary (30) along with the zero-modes contribution as a

volume integral. considering all the factors properly, the disk amplitude becomes

se (f, a, b) = tp z dt dp r det(cid:16) h + b + f (cid:17)

be isolated by re-normalization of the string tension and does not aect the formulation. the

corrections can be absorbed by mass re-normalization and essentially correspond to the dp-brane

world-volume re-normalization. to obtain a renormalized amplitude, we re-dene the dp-brane
world-volume f  = f

9

the index r stands for the re-normalization of the dp-brane. then the eective dynamics (31)

for a curved dp-brane (p = 1, 3, 5 . . .), next to leading order, becomes precisely the dirac-born-

infeld (dbi) action

se (fr, a, br) = tp z dt dp r det(cid:16) hr + br + f (cid:17) + o(2) .

(33)

thus the eective low energy dynamics of a curved dp-brane, next to leading order in its

derivative expansion is described by the dbi action. since the computation is a low energy

approximation, the renormalized dbi action (33) receives corrections from all the higher orders
in  which in turn is associated with the derivative expansion of the dp-brane coordinates
f (t, i) in this formalism.

7 zero-modes and world-volume geometry

in this section, we re-call the boundary conditions (14), for the non-zero modes of open string,

derived in section 4. the tangential components of the string coordinates, a(), can be re-

written and the boundary conditions for a dp-brane become

n0 + i n(0) n(i)ei i = 0 ,
ni  i n(0) n(i)ei 0 = 0
ni + i n(i) n(j)(bij + fij) j = 0 ,

and

(34)

where ei = (b0i + f0i) corresponds to the electric eld components (e1, e2, . . . ep) and (bij +
fij) denes the magnetic part of the background elds. for membranes and higher dimen-
sional branes, both the electric and magnetic elds are non-vanishing unlike the string. in the
orthogonal moving frame, the canonical momenta conjugate to (a, ) can be expressed as

p a(z) = na + b(ba

b + f a
b )

and

p (z) = n .

the equal time (radial) canonical commutators in bulk satisfy:

h a(z) , b(z) i = 0 ,
h p a(z) , p b(z) i = 0
h a(z) , p b(z) i = iab (z  z) .

and

since the zero-modes have been separated out from the string coordinates, the integral

(35)

(36)

d i(z) = 0 .

z

10

the commutator (36) can be substituted for the conjugate momenta p b(z) and at the disk

boundary becomes

however, the presence of zero-modes a

(0), in an orthonormal moving frame, contribute towards
the non-vanishing of commutator (37) and thus the open string centre of mass becomes non-

h a() , b() i

= 0 .

(37)

commutative in presence of the background elds. since the dynamics on the world-volume of

a dp-brane is due to the string uctuations at its end points, the commutator for the dp-brane

collective coordinates in a static gauge can be expressed as

h f a(t(), i()) , f b(t(), j()) i

= 2 i(m 1[b + f ])ab ,

(38)

a [b + f ]cb. the right hand side in eq.(38) is due to the induced uxes
where mab = ab [b + f ]c
on the world-volume of a dp-brane leading to the non-commutative geometry. from the string

theory perspective, the non-commutative geometry is a boundary phenomena and thus closed

strings do not perceive this special geometry. however, for a dp-brane the non-commuatative

feature is in bulk which represents its world-volume.

now generalizing the lorentz rotation (r)-matrix from our earlier discussions [11], the non-
b b. then, the boundary

trivial components of the non-zero modes can be re-written as a = ra

conditions for the (tilted) dp-brane, in terms of the transformed coordinates, become

e i = 0

mp (p)i = 0

and

 = 0 ,

(39)

where e = [n  i n(0)n(i) ei] lie on the (0i)-planes and are dened with respect to the
boost from the original frame. the remaining components are magnetic in nature and are used
to rotate the (ij)-planes: mp = [n i n(i)n(j) (bij + fij)]. here the transformed boundary
conditions for the tilted dp-brane in the tangential directions (i, (p)i) are the usual neumann
conditions. at the rst sight, the conditions (39) appear to identical with a new dp-brane in

absence of the electric and magnetic uxes. nevertheless, the uxes are manifested to rotate the

original dp-brane to a tilted (new) one and the transformed tangential coordinates, a, become

non-local. thus the non-locality depends on the electric and magnetic uxes and the explicit

11

it is straight forward to note that the equal time commutator for the string modes (including the

zero modes) becomes a delta function along the remaining spatial coordinates. this provides

an explicit demonstration that the non-commutativity on the world-volume of a dp-brane can

be manifested as the non-locality on its world-volume.

8 generalization to super dp-branes

the dp-brane dynamics obtained (33) in presence of arbitrary string backgrounds may be gen-
eralized to include the respective fermionic partners for the open string coordinates x (z, z)8 as
well as for the collective coordinates f (t, i). in general, the super-symmetric dp-brane analysis
becomes highly non-trivial in presence of super-string backgrounds, mostly due to the dp-brane
collective coordinates, f (t, i), and the u (1) gauge eld, aa, living on its world-volume. how-
ever, for a constant u (1) gauge eld strength fab, the computations simplify to some extent in

an orthonormal frame and the eective dynamics for a super dp-brane may be addressed with

super-string background elds.

as a rst step, towards a generalization of the dp-brane eective dynamics to the case of the
super dp-brane, one needs to consider the type i super-string.9 in fact, type i open super-string
is un-oriented and thus can be considered as the interacting open and closed strings (b = 0). in

this section, we briey present the computations for the fermionic partners by drawing analogy

from that of the bosonic case (with vanishing kr potential) to avoid any repetition. this is

indeed the case for dp-branes with p = 0, 2, 4, . . . in type iia theory.

now re-consider the non-linear sigma model (2) with the majorana fermions (z) as the
super-partners of the (non-oriented) open string coordinates x (z, z). also, consider (t, i)
as the fermionic coordinates for the dp-brane. for simplicity, the zero-modes are separated

out from the fermionic coordinates similar to the one under the bosonic discussions.

in an

orthonormal frame, with a conformal gauge, the non-zero fermionic modes in the non-linear

7the modied neumann matrix (18) can be tuned to the usual disk propagator by the r-matrix at the expense

of the electric and magnetic uxes.

8here the space-time index is uderstood with ( = 0, 1, 2 . . . 9).
9in the bosonic case, we have considered oriented (b 6= 0) open string to obtain the eective dynamics of a
dp-brane. it allows one to analyze the type ii (n = 2, d = 10) close super-string channel. however, a consistent
open super-string generalization reduces the super-symmetry to n = 1 (type i).

sigma model action10 in the neveu-schwarz-ramond (nsr) formalism can be expressed as

s(, a) =

i

4(cid:16)  z

d2z aa + n(a)n(b)

fab z 

d a b(cid:17) ,

(41)

where a = ea

 . then the expression (41) along with that in eq.(13) for vanishing kr
potential (b = 0), takes care of the interacting type i open super-string with the massless closed

string elds. the complete action (eqs.(13) and (41)) can be seen to be invariant under the

super-symmetric transformations

a = a
a = iaaa ,

and

(42)

where  denotes an innitesimal (constant) majorana spinor and a denotes two-dimensional

matrices on the string world-sheet. in addition, the covariant condition (1) is also modied due

to the fermions at the disk boundary and can be expressed as a constraint.

now the path-integral (3) can be generalized appropriately by taking into account the proper

fermionic measures. the eective dynamics for the non-zero modes can be described manifestly

in super-eld notations [26] and in a static gauge takes the form:

s(f, )su sy =

1

gs z

d x a(z, ) da() ( x a  f a) exp(cid:16)  s[x, ]su sy(cid:17) ,

(43)

where d =   z denotes the super derivative ( d2 = z) and (, ) correspond to the super-
symmetric partners of (z, z). the collective coordinates for the super dp-brane is represented
by f (a, a), where a denotes the super-partners of a. the super-space string coordinates
become

x a(z, ) = x a(z) +  a(z)

(44)

and the corresponding measure in the path-integral (43) takes the form:

da = dada .
the super-space action in eq.(43) can be expressed as

s[, ]su sy = s[x, a, b](b=0) + s[, a]

(45)

and corresponds to an interacting type i super-string dynamics at low energy.

it is straight

forward to note that the dynamics of the dp-branes is due to the underlying type i super-string

10we follow the conventional notations as in ref.[25].

coupled to the curved backgrounds of closed string. the additional boundary condition arises

from the fermions in the ns and ramond sectors. for the non-zero modes, they can be given

by

where a

 are the left and right moving components of a on the string world-sheet. the rst
expression in eq.(46) is the modied neumann condition in presence background elds where as

the second expression there represents the dirichlet boundary condition.

the induced super-symmetric invariant metric, hab, and the rr (p + 1)-form, cabc..., are
modied appropriately due to the fermionic coordinates, a(a), in a static gauge, on the
world-volume of the dp-brane. the super-symmetric (invariant) elds can be expressed in the

orthogonal frame and they take the form

hab = abda f adb f b
cabc... = cabc...da f adb f bdc f c . . . ,

and

where

and

f a(a, a) = f a(a) + aa(a)
da = a  aa .

(47)

(48)

now the path-integration over the fermionic modes (a, ) can be performed by extending

the analysis for the bosonic case discussed in previous chapters 5 and 6. the calculation essen-

tially reduces to that of jacobian involving the determinants. the path-integral in bulk becomes

gaussian and the jacobian due to the fermions in the ns-ns sector is found to be unity. since

the eld contents in the ns-ns sector turns out to be similar to that of the bosonic string, the

jacobian for the bosons in this sector becomes the one obtained (24) in the bosonic case with

vanishing kr potential. on the other hand, in the rr sector the jacobian due to the fermions

exactly cancels that of the bosons. there is no substantial contribution to the jacobian in the

rr sector. thus, the presence of fermions give a trivial contribution to the eective dynamics

and do not aect the result obtained in bulk for the bosonic case.

in fact, the super-string

eective action takes the same form as the bosonic string theory though the eld contents are

modied with respect to the fermionic partners.

on the other hand, the path-integral over the boundary elds involves the fermionic partners

and has to be evaluated perturbatively. the non-triviality is mainly due to the super dp-brane

14

collective coordinates f (a(), a()). to calculate the boundary contribution, we consider the
geodesic expansion11 about a point (a, a) in super-space [26]. as a consequence, the compu-
tations become non-trivial due to the modied induced elds (47) on the world-volume. the
expression for the generalized extrinsic curvature, k, can be obtained readily from the modi-
ed elds. after a considerable computations, the boundary path-integrals can be evaluated.12

final result of the path-integrations in bulk as well as at the boundary can be encoded in the
generalized dbi action describing the super dp-brane13 (p = 0, 2, 4 . . .) dynamics to o() in
open string theory and becomes

s(f, )su sy = tp z dp+1 r det(cid:16) h + f (cid:17) + qp z dp+1 e

f  c .

9 discussion

to summarize, the computations were performed in two parts, namely: for the bosonic dp-brane

and then the super dp-brane. in the rst part, we have demonstrated an explicit computations

for an arbitrary dp-brane (any p = 0, 1, 2, . . .) in generic close string backgrounds to obtain

the non-linear dynamics in open bosonic string theory. it was shown that the path-integration

in bulk is essentially responsible for the non-perturbative dynamics. on the other hand, the
integrations over the boundary elds were performed next to the leading order in . the

perturbative corrections were expressed in terms of the induced curvatures on the world-volume

of the dp-brane and were found to be associated with a logarithmic divergence. a suitable
re-normalization of the dp-brane collective coordinates, f (t, i), were performed to obtain the
non-linear dbi action describing the non-perturbative dynamics of the dp-brane. in addition,

the boundary conditions for the arbitrary dp-brane, in presence of close string backgrounds, were
re-viewed with the zero-modes. in a static gauge, the dp-brane collective coordinates, f (t, i)
were found to be non-commutative and the world-volume becomes non-local at the expense

of non-commutative geometry. further analysis of the world-volume geometry is believed to

enhance the understanding of gauge theory and would be addressed else where.

in the second part, our computations were generalized to include the appropriate super

partners in the type i super-string theory. the choice of orthonormal moving frame facili-

tates the inclusion of fermions in the locally inertial frame. the non-perturbative part of the

11it can be expressed from that of the bosonic one (8) by replacing the partial derivatives, a, with the super-

derivatives, da, as in eq.(48) and taking a note on the super-coordinates f (a, a).

12 we skip the details of the steps involving re-normalization of the super-brane coordinates, which can also be

intuitively obtained from that of the bosonic case discussed.

13 the even p case is straightforward to conrm from the eq.(49).

super dp-brane dynamics was obtained by performing the gaussian path-integration in bulk.
the boundary integrals were evaluated perturbatively and the corrections in  were found
to be associated with the derivative expansion of the dp-brane super-coordinates f (a, a).
an qualitative analysis for the boundary integrals were discussed by drawing analogy from its

bosonic counterpart. finally, the non-perturbative super dp-brane dynamics were encoded in

the non-linear dynamics of the dbi action.

in this paper, we have computed the disk amplitude and thus the u (1) gauge eld on the

world-volume is consistent. however, at the quantum level (higher string loops), the consistency

condition from the anomaly cancellation of interacting open super-string would require the

group to be so(32). the issue of non-abelian world-volume dynamics becomes technically

dicult and some attempts can be found in ref.[7]. another important issue is the special

world-volume geometry due to the zero-modes. from the string theory point of view, this is

a boundary phenomena. however for a dp-brane, the non-commutative feature is in the bulk

of its world-volume. since the world-volume theory for a dp-brane is a dimensionally reduced

super yang-mills to (p + 1)-dimensions, the gauge theory becomes a non-local eld theory and

is a subtle issue.
