abstract

we discuss the relation between singletons in ads3 and logarithmic operators in the cft
on the boundary. in 2 dimensions there can be more logarithmic operators apart from
those which correspond to singletons in ads, because logarithmic operators can occur
when the dimensions of primary elds dier by an integer instead of being equal. these
operators may be needed to account for the greybody factor for gauge bosons in the bulk.

one particularly interesting example of the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] is the
ads3/cft2 correspondence, which relates supergravity on ads3  s3 to a 2-dimensional
cft. one advantage of this is that 2-dimensional conformal eld theories are very well
understood, and that makes ads3 especially suitable for studying the relation between
singletons on ads and logarithmic conformal eld theories (lcft), since almost all pre-
vious work on lcft has concentrated on the 2-dimensional case.

according to [2, 3], at the boundary of adsd+1 we have a coupling between bulk elds

i(~x, z) and boundary elds oi(~x), r ddxioi, where the boundary elds are subject to

the boundary condition i(~x, z) = i(~x, r), with z = r the boundary of adsd+1. the
relation between correlation functions in cf td and the bulk supergravity action is

hepir dd xioii = es[{i}]

this relation was used in [4, 5] to show that, if there are singletons in adsd+1, the theory
on the boundary is in fact an lcft. a theory of free singletons is formulated in terms of
a dipole-ghost pair of elds a and b which satisfy [6]

( + m2)a + b = 0,

( + m2)b = 0

these elds have the bulk ads action

s = z dd+1xg(cid:18)gab  m2ab

(3)

the elds a and b couple to boundary elds c and d and using eq. (1) the two-point
functions of c and d are found to be (see [5] for details of the calculation)

hc(x)c(y)i = 0

c

hc(x)d(y)i = hd(x)c(y)i =

hd(x)d(y)i =

(d  2c ln|x  y|)

(5)

with the dimension  given by (  d) = m2, c = (2  d) and d = 2  d.
these are the usual two-point functions for logarithmic operators in cft [7, 8]. these
correlation functions occur if the hamiltonian (in two dimensions, the virasoro generator
l0) is non-diagonalizable, and has the jordan form

l0|ci = h|ci,

l0|di = h|di + |ci

and similarly for l0, where for singletons we have h = h and so  = 2h. the theories
with this type of operators are called logarithmic cfts and their properties have been
studied extensively [8] since they were introduced in [7]. applications of lcft to strings
and d-brane scattering were developed in [9, 10]. a recent paper relevant to ads3 is [11]
one way to see if elds of this type exist in a theory is to look at the four-point
functions of ordinary elds. if there are no logarithmic operators, the operator product
expansion for primary elds has the form

oi(x1)oj(x2)  xi

f k
ij

|x12|i+jk

ok(x1) +   

(6)

1

and hoi(x1)oj(x2)i = |x12|2iij, which leads to an expansion for four-point functions
of the form

hoi(x1)oj(x2)oj(x3)oi(x4)i = xkl

f k
ijf l
ij

|x12|i+j|x34|i+j

f (x)

(7)

where x = x12x34/x13x24 and f (x) has an expansion in powers of x, without any logarith-
mic singularity. if there are logarithmic operators however, the ope has to be modied
and we have instead

oi(x1)oj(x2) 

1

|x12|i+j (d + c ln|x12|2) +   

(8)

which together with the two-point functions for c and d leads to four point functions of
the form (7), but with f (x) x0 x2 ln x. indeed, logarithmic singularities have been found
in four point functions calculated in supergravity on ads5 [12, 13], and it is possible that
these could be an indication that there is an lcft on the boundary of ads5. however,
these logarithms could also be accounted for as the perturbative expansion of anomalous
dimensions in cf t4, with no need for logarithmic operators [14]. the clearest evidence
for the existence of logarithmic operators in ads/cft comes from calculations of grey-
body factors in ads3. since grey-body factors are related to two-point functions in cft,
logarithms here are a clear indication that we have logarithmic operators on the boundary.
the grey-body factor (or absorption cross section) for a eld in ads3 which couples
to a eld o(x) in the cft on the boundary is related to the two point function in the
cft by [15, 16]

abs =



 z d2x [g(t  i, x)  g(t + i, x)]

(9)

where g(t, x) = ho(x, t)o(0)i is the thermal greens function in imaginary time. this
can be determined from the periodicity in imaginary time and the singularities of the
greens function [15], which if o is a primary eld with weights h, h, are given by

ho(t, x)o(0)i  co
+ x2h
x2h



with x = t  x. g(t, x) has the form

g(t, x) = c

for a btz black hole with mass m = r2
, angular momentum j = 2r+r, left and right
temperatures t = (r+r)/2, and hawking temperature given by 2/th = 1/t+ +1/t
[17]. the absorption cross section is then [15, 16]

abs(h, h) =

this expression can be obtained either using the eective string method for supergravity
[15] or using the ads/cft correspondence [16, 18].

a large number of classical calculations of absorption cross sections have given results
which are consistent with (12) (or a similar expression for fermions) [15], including calcu-
lations for several elds for the btz black hole [19, 16]. however, in [19] the cross section
for gauge bosons with spin 2, which couple to elds with h, h = (2, 0) or (0, 2) on the
boundary was found to have logarithmic corrections which cannot be accounted for by eq.
(12). in [20], the grey-body factor for singletons was calculated, and while this does have
a logarithmic correction to the cross section (12), it was found that it still does not give
the correct cross section for the gauge bosons. the question we would like to address in
this letter is, are there other kinds of logarithmic operators in ads3/cft2, and can they
correctly account for the greybody factor for the gauge bosons?

the greybody factor for the gauge bosons with spin s = 2 in ads3, in the low tem-

perature limit   t, was found to be [19]

gb
abs = 2r2 [1 + rs ln(2rs)]

(13)

in the low temperature limit, eq. (12) becomes, up to a normalization whch is proportional
to c ( = h + h),

(14)

abs(h, h)  23

so that the second term in eq. (13) is an indication that the gauge bosons cannot just
couple to ordinary primary elds on the boundary. the greybody factor for a singleton
can also be calculated from eq. (9), using the relation hd(t, x)d(0)i = 
hc(t, x)d(0)i,
since hc(t, x)d(0)i is the same as the two point function for an ordinary primary eld.
abs = abs(h, h)/ [20], and
the greybody factor for a singleton is therefore given by s
so

which in the low temperature limit reduces to

(16)

in an lcft we always have the freedom to shift d by d  d + c, which leaves eq.
(5) invariant, and this can be used to choose any value for the constant c. however,
comparing eqs. (16) and (13), we can see that the logarithmic term in (13) is multiplied
by an extra factor of r and is thus of a sub-leading order compared to (16). the gauge
boson cannot therefore be represented by a singleton in ads3 [20]. however, we cannot
immediately conclude, as was said in [20], that the gauge boson has nothing to do with
the ads/lcft correspondence, because there is potentially a much richer spectrum of
logarithmic operators in a two dimensional lcft than has been considered so far. the
logarithmic operators we have looked at so far arise when the dimensions of two of the

3

primary elds ok in the ope (6) become degenerate, which leads to logarithms in the
four-point functions and the ope has to be modied to include the logarithmic pair c
and d, as in eq. (8). in fact, logarithms will also arise in the four point function if two of
the primary elds have dimensions which are not equal, but dier by an integer, so that
it is a descendant of one primary eld which becomes degenerate with the other primary
eld. this is because the function f (x) in the four-point function (7) usually satises a
fuchsian dierential equation, such as a hypergeometric equation, and when there are no
degenerate dimensions the solutions have the form

f (x)  xi

anxn



xn=0

(17)

but when two of the dimensions dier by an integer, say 2 = 1 +n, the second solution
instead has the form



(anxn + bnxn log x)

(18)

f (x)  xi

xn=0

in this case we again have a logarithmic pair with the higher of the two dimensions which
as before make the hamiltonian non-diagonalizable, as in eq. (5). in addition the c eld
satises in both cases the usual condition for a primary eld

ln|ci = 0,

n  1

(19)

however, in the earlier situation where two primary elds became degenerate, d also
satised this condition, while in the case where we have two elds whose dimension diers
by an integer n we have instead

ln|di = 0,

n  2

(l1)n|di = |c i,

(20)
where c  is another primary eld, with conformal weights (h  n, h), and  is some
constant. c is now not really a primary eld, but rather a descendant of c :
|ci =
n|c i, where n is some combination of virasoro generators and, in general, the
other generators of the chiral algebra of the cft, of dimension n. eq. (19) then implies
that c must be a null vector of the cft, that is [ln, n ] = 0 for n  1 [21] (which
is why the two-point function hcci = 0). this type of logarithmic operator therefore
cannot exist with any dimension, but only with those dimensions for which there are null
vectors of the algebra. because of this, we can only have these generalized logarithmic
operators in 2-dimensional cft, and we do not expect them in adsd+1 for d > 2.

the logarithmic pair c and d still have the same correlation functions (4), and c  is

just an ordinary primary eld with the usual two point function

hc (x+, x)c (0)i

x2(hn )
+

x2h


(21)

so it seems that these new elds cannot give us anything new when we compute greybody
factors. however, it is easy to see that we can reproduce the greybody factor for the
gauge bosons (13) if we assume that they correspond not to one of the elds c, d or c 
in the lcft, but to a linear combination of all three. this might happen, for example,

4

if the bosons can be thought of as arising from the fusion of two primary elds, since c,
d and c  must always appear together in any ope. then if c  has dimension = 2,
as is expected for the gauge bosons [20], and c , c, d form a representation of the type
discussed above with n = 1, the greybody factor will have exactly the right form, with
the logarithmic term being of sub-leading order. of course, this would imply that the
representation which includes the primary eld c  must have a null vector at level 1. this
would be true if c  has (h, h) = (0, 2) (or (2, 0)), as then l1|c i (or l1|c i) is a null
vector. if c  has (h, h) = (1, 1), there could still be a null; vector if, for example, the cft
on the boundary has a conserved current for which j1|c i = 0.
now that we know there could be elds in an lcft on the boundary that give the
correct greybody factor for the gauge bosons, the next question we address is, what sort
of elds in the bulk can couple to these elds on the boundary? to answer this question,
we start be reviewing how the conformal weights of elds on the boundary determine the
mass and spin of elds in the bulk when there are no logarithmic operators. we write the
metric for ads3 in the form

ds2 = l2(cid:16) cosh2 d 2 + sinh2 d2 + d2(cid:17)

(22)

in these coordinates the virasoro generators l0, l1, with commutators [l0, l1] = l1
and [l1, l1] = 2l0, for spin s elds are (u =  + , v =   ) [22, 23]:

l0 = iu

l1 = ieiu coth 2u 
l1 = ieiu coth 2u

sinh 2

v +

(23)

and similarly for l0, l1 with u  v and s  s. for a primary elds , the conditions
l0 = h and l0 = h, and l1 = l1 = 0 can then be solved to give s = h  h and

ei(hu+hv)
(cosh )h+h

 

the second casimir of sl(2, r) is

l2 =

1
2

(l1l1 + l1l1)  l2

0

(24)

(25)

and similarly for l2, so that, using eqs. (22) and (23), the sum of the two casimirs is

(26)
for a primary eld, (l2 + l2) = (2h(h 1) + 2h(h 1)), so eq. (26) can be written as

l2 + l2 = l2 + s2 coth2 

  +

s2

l2 sinh2 !  = m2

(27)

5

which is the equation of motion for a eld with spin s and mass m in ads3, with the mass

l2m2 = 2h(h  1) + 2 h(h  1)  s2 = (  2)

(28)

so we can see that the conformal weights h and h on the boundary completely determine
the mass and spin of the elds in ads3 (and vice versa). we can repeat this analysis for
a logarithmic pair c and d on the boundary. c satises the same conditions as  above,

so we nd c  ei(hu+hv)/(cosh )h+h. the conditions l0d = hd + c and l0d = hd + c

then imply that

d = [u + v + f ()]c

(29)

where the function f () will depend on what type of logarithmic operator we have. in
the simplest case, which we expect to give us singletons, we have l1d = l1d = 0, which
has the solution

d = [u + v  2i ln(cosh ) + ]c

(30)

where  is an arbitrary constant, which we can set to any value using the freedom to shift
d by an amount proportional to c. evaluating the second casimirs gives the equations
of motion for the elds in ads3 which will couple to c and d:

  +
  +

s2

l2 sinh2 ! c = m2c
l2 sinh2 ! d = m2d + 4(  1)c

s2

(31)

with m2 again given by eq. (28). when s = 0, these are just the expected equations
of motion for singleton dipole-pair (2) (apart from a dierent normalization of c), with
the expected relation between the singleton mass m and the dimension of the logarithmic
operator . thus we can see that the mass and spin in ads3 are still completely deter-
mined by the data of the lcft on the boundary when we have singletons and logarithmic
operators. this also give us another way of seeing, as was found in [5] that there can be
no logarithmic operators with  = 1, corresponding to m2 = 1.
now we can use this map between ads3 and cft2 to see what kind of operators will
couple to the other kinds of logarithmic operators. in this case we have three elds c, d
and c , but since c and c  are both primary elds they will both have the same form as
before, but with weights (h, h) for c and (h  n, h) for c . d is then given by eq. (29)
with f () a solution of the (n + 1)th order dierential equation (l1)n +1d = 0. the
second casimirs then give the equations of motion in ads3 as

  +
  +

s2

l2 sinh2 ! c = m2c
l2 sinh2 ! d = m2d + 4(  1)c + 

s2

(32)

which is the same as the equations of motion for the singleton except that we have the
new eld is  = l1l1d.  will therefore be a descendant of c , or in ads3 it will
correspond to some derivative of the eld which couples to the primary eld c , and

6

the action for the singleton (3) should be modied by adding a term which couples the
singleton to the new eld. we will therefore have an interacting theory instead of a free
singleton, with an action of the form

s = z d3xg(cid:18)gab  m2ab 

1
2

b2 + a(cid:19)

(33)

where  is a derivative of a eld with spin n, for a spinless singleton. in addition, it is
important that c is also a descendant in this case, and so the eld a in the above action
is also a derivative of the eld which couples to c  and is not a fundamental eld itself.
this is especially signicant for the case when n = 1, since then c  has no descendant
at level 1 except c itself, and so the action in ads3 in this case is the same as for the
ordinary singleton, except that b is now a derivative of a eld b with spin 1. of course,
we also need to add to the action the kinetic and mass terms for the eld b to treat this
eld properly.

although we have seen that new kinds of logarithmic operators can exist in ads3/lcft2,

they cannot exist for just any values of m2 and s - we have to have a null vector in the
cft on the boundary. this means that to determine if such elds really exist we need
to know more about the structure of the cft, or to calculate four-point functions, from
which the ope could be deduced. however, it seems to be clear that at least one example
of this type of operator is needed to give the correct greybody factor for the spin-2 gauge
bosons. it is an interesting question why the same interactions cannot be introduced for
singletons which do not have special values for the mass, which would lead to a contradic-
tion in the cft, but is not obviously forbidden from the three-dimensional point of view.
possibly related is the question of why these type of elds can exist in ads3 but not in
adsd+1 for d > 2  since the full virasoro algebra applies only to cft in 2 dimensions,
there are no null vectors in d > 2 and so these type of logarithmic do not exist, although
there can be singletons and the ordinary logarithmic pair of c and d in any dimension.
