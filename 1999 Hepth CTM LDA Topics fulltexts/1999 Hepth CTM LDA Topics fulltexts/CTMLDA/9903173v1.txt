we study the derivative expansion for the eective action in the framework of the exact renor-
malization group for a single component scalar theory. by truncating the expansion to the rst two
terms, the potential uk and the kinetic coecient zk, our analysis suggests that a set of coupled
dierential equations for these two functions can be established under certain smoothness conditions
for the background eld and that sharp and smooth cut-o give the same result. in addition we
nd that, dierently from the case of the potential, a further expansion is needed to obtain the
dierential equation for zk, according to the relative weight between the kinetic and the potential
terms. as a result, two dierent approximations to the zk equation are obtained. finally a numer-
ical analysis of the coupled equations for uk and zk is performed at the non-gaussian xed point in
d < 4 dimensions to determine the anomalous dimension of the eld.

i. introduction

the dynamics of a quantum system with very many (an innite number of) degrees of freedom, the subject of
quantum field theory, involves very many scales at once. as it is by now well understood this is the source
of the main diculties encountered in the study of such a system. in perturbation theory one of the most striking
manifestation of these diculties is the appearance of divergent quantities. the origin of this nonsensical result should
probably be addressed to a wrong choice of the representation. in fact, unlike any problem with a nite number of
degrees of freedom, in the present case the choice of the representation is part of the solution of the dynamical problem
due to the existence of inequivalent representations, but up to now not very much progress has been made in this
direction. moreover there are phenomena, such as the chiral symmetry breaking, where it is necessary to resort to
non perturbative methods, since no small parameter is available for a perturbative expansion. typical tools for this
kind of investigations are the schwinger-dyson equations as well as the variational approximations. unfortunately
even within these approaches divergent quantities are still present and, unlike the perturbative case, a systematic way
of handling these divergences is still lacking. this has cast serious doubts on the validity of the results obtained with
these methods.

from a dierent stand point the renormalization group method, more precisely the wilson formulation of the
renormalization group (rg) [1], has been invented to handle those dynamical problems involving very many scales.
the main idea of the method is to break the original problem into a series of subproblems each involving a more
restricted scale range and to seek for its solution by iteratively solving these subproblems. the advantage of this
method is that it is non perturbative by construction and that no problem of divergences is ever encountered.

there are dierent (more or less equivalent) ways to implement this program. the realization in terms of dierential
equations in the momentum space [27], generally named exact renormalization group equations, has been widely
studied in the last years and even employed as a tool for investigating many problems related to phase transitions
where the ow of the physical parameters cannot be controlled by simple perturbative calculations.

among the various existing formulations of the exact rg equations, the wegner-houghton (wh) equation [2] is
particularly appealing for the transparency of its physical interpretation, and the most straightforward approximation

to this equation, obtained by restricting the problem to analyzing the rg evolution of the costant (x-independent)
part of the action, namely the local potential approximation (lpa), has been shown to contain many interesting
features. for instance the exactness of the lpa for n   has been found in [2] (n is the number of scalar elds
i), as well as the xed point structure of the scalar theory has been recovered in the lpa [4,8]; furthermore, the
typically non-perturbative feature of convexity of the eective potential is already contained in the lpa [5,9,10].

in order to extract informations on the dynamics of the eld, however, it is necessary to improve the lpa by
including the eects of the eld uctuations. the natural extension of the lpa is the obtained by considering a
derivative expansion of the action, that is by adding in the general form of the action terms with higher and higher
number of derivatives of the elds. this expansion is motivated by the expectation that, for a suciently smooth
background conguration, the action should be quasi-local. a set of two coupled equations for the local potential
uk() (k is the momentum scale at which the action sk is dened) and the coecient zk() of the lowest order
derivative term,  has been deduced and studied by resorting to a smooth cut-o [8,11] that allows a weighted
integration of the various modes appearing in the original action. an equation for zk() which allows to recover the
lowest order perturbative anomalous dimension of the eld in four dimensions has also been obtained [12] from the
wh equation by making use of a sharp cut-o to integrate out the ultraviolet modes.

in this paper we critically reconsider the set of coupled equations for uk() and zk() and more generally discuss
the derivative expansion in the framework of the wh equation. in particular, after a brief review in sect.ii of the
wh method and the derivation of the lpa, in sect. iii motivated by the result of [12] we check the reliability of the
equations derived in that paper and evaluate the anomalous dimension of the g33 theory in d = 6 dimensions to the
order o(g2
3) and, afterwards, the anomalous dimension of the scalar theory at the wilson-fisher (wf) xed point in
d < 4 dimensions.

in sect. iv we move to a critical revision of the derivation of this system of coupled dierential equations for uk and
zk. this gives us the possibility of reconsidering the longstanding problem which aects the implementation of the
derivative expansion of the wh equation. as soon as a non-constant eld is considered, the dierential equation for
zk() (and, more generally, the equations for the higher order coecients in the derivative expansion), is aected by
the presence of some non-analytical terms that apparently spoil the very dierential nature of the equation. the origin
of these terms is analysed in detail and the derivation of the equation for zk in the momentum space is presented.
we shall see that under a specic assumption of smoothness of the background eld, it is possible to derive the
dierential equation and that the dangerous terms are actually negligible. the fate of these non-analytical terms
when the sharp cut-o is replaced with a smooth one is also discussed and we shall show that for a suciently slow
uctuating background eld, both sharp and smooth cut-o produce the same equations. in addition we show that
the assuption about the relative weight between kinetic and potential terms in the action is crucial in the derivation
itself of the zk equation. our conclusions are summarized in sect.v.

ii. lpa and loop expansion

let us call s[] the action of a scalar eld  which contains all the fourier components q such that 0 < |q| < .
for the sake of simplicity in this paper we shall only consider the single component scalar theory.usually we want to
describe a physical process as the scattering of two bosons with momenta p such that p << . as already mentioned
the origin of the diculties in perturbation theory is due the fact that we have to take into account the contributions
to this process coming from all the fourier modes between p and . actually the action s[], often called the
wilsonian eective action at the scale , is more appropriate to describe the physics of the system at scales p  .
at a scale p <<  it would seem more convenient to directly deal with an eective action sp[] that describes the
physical phenomena taking into account only those scales around p. the renormalization group method provides
this eective action. let us dene sp[], in the euclidean version of the theory, through the equation

e 1

h sp[] =z [d]e 1

h s[+]

(1)

where we have split the original eld (x) into a background eld (x) containing only the modes between zero and
p and a uctuation eld (x) containing those between p and ,

(x) = (x) + (x).

(2)

sp[], called the wilsonian eective action at the scale p, contains, within its parameters, the eect of the interactions
among the modes in the range [p, ] and the modes below p and therefore it is the eective action we were looking
for. the dicult task here is to perform the integration over the high frequency modes . the above integral can

2

be approximated by means of the loop expansion which amounts to a series expansion in powers of h. the one loop
approximation gives the o(h) correction to the tree level result sp[] = s[] and corresponds to a gaussian integral
over the uctuation  obtained expanding s[ + ] up to 2 [13].

we may now pose the question in a dierent way and ask how does the wilsonian eective action sk evolve once
in this case the gaussian
we integrate the modes in the shell [k  k, k] with an innitesimal k to get skk.
approximation, i.e. the one loop result, becomes exact [2]. the problem of the evaluation of the eective action at
the scale k in eq. (1) can then be turned into the problem of solving a rst order dierential equation for sk[] with
respect to the variable k. the action s[] is the the boundary condition for this equation. this is the wegner-
houghton method. actually the problem of solving this dierential equation for sk is as dicult as to perform the
integral in eq. (1) and we have to resort sooner or later to some approximation if we want to make any progress. as
a rst step let us go back to eq. (1) which, replacing  with k and p with k  k, is the dening equation for skk
in terms of sk

e 1

h skk[] =z [d]e 1

h sk[+]

(3)

our second step is to insert in the above equation an ansatz for sk[]. at this point we make the assumption that

a good approximation to sk[] is provided by the derivative expansion (d is the number of dimensions)

sk[] =z ddxhuk() +

2

zk()  + yk()( )2 + i

(4)

by inserting eq. (4) into (3) we should be able to derive an innite system of coupled dierential equations for the
coecients functions uk, zk, yk,.
the lowest order approximation in the derivative expansion is the lpa. replacing in eq. (4) zk = 1, yk = 0,,
and then considering a constant background eld (x) = 0 we get from eq. (3) an evolution equation for uk(0)

(5)

here the  means derivative with respect to 0 and the result of the angular integration is nd = 2/((4)d/2(d/2)).
this equation has been found again and again (see for instance [14,4]) and the consensus on this equation is

unanimous.

the equation above is a non perturbative evolution equation for uk. suppose that the potential uk(0) has a

polynomial expansion and for the sake of simplicity let us require the z(2) symmetry 0  0

by taking 2n times (n = 0, 1, 2, ) the derivatives of eq. (5) with respect to 0 at 0 = 0 we get an innite system
of coupled equations for the coupling constants g2n(k):

g2(k) =

a diagrammatic interpretation of the above equations is straightforward, provided one identies g2n with the 2n
external legs vertices and the denominators (k2 + g2(k))m with m propagators joining the various vertices; in fact each
r.h.s.in eqs. (7) represents the sum of all the one loop diagrams with xed number of external legs that can be arranged
combining the g2n. it is then clear that the above system is an approximation to the innite set of schwinger-dyson
equations for the greens functions at zero external momenta. of course as it is true for the complete schwinger-dyson
system, eq. (7) is indeterminate. to make contact with perturbation theory, more precisely with the h expansion, we

3

can seek for solutions where each coupling constant is developed in an h-power series g2n = g(0)
2n +.
as it is well known in this case the solution of the schwinger-dyson equations and a fortiori of our system becomes
unique and it may be easily veried that the ultraviolet behavior of the coupling constants ow at o(h) coincides
with the usual one-loop result. let us consider for instance the one loop contribution to the perturbative -function
for the 4 theory. it is recovered in the ultraviolet regime, k2 >> g2, by retaining in the r.h.s. the o(h0) values of
the couplings, that is their boundary values at k = , g4() = g4, g6() = g8() =  = 0. however eqs. (7) show
that g6 is o(g3
4) eect. it is then clear that higher
loops perturbative contributions to the -function are present in eqs. (7) due to the fact that all vertices in the r.h.s.
are k-dependent. it is also easy to realize that, in order to recover the full two-loop g4 -function, it is necessary to
go beyond the lpa since the g6 and g2 contributions are not sucient to get the complete o(g3

4) and then g6 in the r.h.s. of the -function of g4 provides a o(g3

2n + hg(1)

2n + h2g(2)

4) eect.

going back to eqs. (7), in order to better exploit the non-perturbative character of this system, a dierent kind
of truncation is needed. a rst step toward its non-perturbative analysis has been taken in [15]. however, due to
the appearance of non-trivial saddle points in the renormalization group equation studied in that paper, the results
should be taken quite cautiously.

the rst step beyond the lpa is discussed in the next section.

iii. derivative expansion and anomalous dimension

by turning on the scale and eld dependence in zk we allow for a non-trivial lowest order derivative term in the
action (4), thus obtaining the rst improvement to the lpa where it was set z = 1. in this case we have to deal
with two coupled equations for uk and zk which can again be reduced to an innite set of coupled equations if one
assumes a polynomial expansion for both uk and zk.

in [12] a specic procedure has been carried out in order to determine a dierential equation for zk in the sharp
cut-o limit and it has been shown that in d = 4 for the o(n ) symmetric 4 theory, the perturbative anomalous
dimension of the eld to o(g2
4) can be obtained from that equation. however it was also noticed that, following
a dierent and, in principle, correct procedure, a dierent equation for zk is obtained.
in practice the gaussian
integration of the uctuation (x) in eq. (3) yields a contribution to skk proportional to ln[(2sk/)|=]
and both procedures require to expand the logarithm in order to derive the dierential equation for zk. in one case,
following the steps outlined in [16] for the one component theory, we split the logarithm (again  indicates derivation
with respect to the eld)

ln[(2sk/)|=] = ln(cid:16)(zk)0 + (uk)



0 + (cid:17)

(8)



0 are evaluated at the constant eld conguration 0 and  is the x dependent part of the
where (zk)0 and (uk)
propagator; the expansion is performed taking  small with respect to the non-uctuating part. in the other case,
according to the procedure developed in [17],

ln[(2sk/)|=] = ln(cid:16)zkk2 + u



k + zk(  k2) + c(cid:17)

(9)

where zkk2 is added and subtracted and the remaining part of the propagator c is proportional to derivatives of the
eld. in the latter case the expansion is made requiring that c and the dierence zk(  k2) are small. this is
justied due to the eld derivative term in c, which is small within the derivative expansion framework, and to the
fact that (x  y) yields in the innitesimal integration shell [k  k, k] a factor k2 which makes the dierence in
eq. (9) vanishing. it is not surprising that two expansions obtained for dierent choices of the expansion parameter,
can be not straightforwardly comparable. as a consequence of the dierent nature of the expansions in eqs. (8) and
(9), we end up with two dierent equations for zk. we will come back to this point in the next section.

the point of view chosen in [12] was to test the reliability of these expansions by comparing the values of the
anomalous dimension of the eld  at the lowest non-vanishing perturbative order obtained from the equations with
the result of the usual perturbative method. it turned out that the equation obtained from the expansion (9) provides
a value of  in agreement with perturbation theory in d = 4.

in order to support the result of [12] and to show that it is not an accidental coincidence, one can easily repeat the
calculation of the anomalous dimension performed in [12] for the case of the cubic theory 3 in d = 6. obviously eqs.
(6,7) are not consistent with the symmetry of the latter theory, but the complete equation for the potential (5) and the
equation for zk, deduced in [12], are still valid because they do not require any assumption on the internal symmetry
of uk and zk. the explicit form of the zk equation as deduced from the expansion of eq. (9) in d dimensions is
(a = zkk2 + u

(10)

and, in order to get a perturbative estimate of the anomalous dimension, we replace, in the r.h.s. of eq. (10), uk and
zk with the corresponding bare quantities, namely g33/3! and 1 (we perform our calculation in the ultraviolet regime
where the mass term in the potential can be neglected). the integration of eq. (10), from  down to a generic value
k < , is then straightforward yielding, in d = 6, zk = g2
3/(3843)ln(/k). the anomalous dimension is immediately
deduced from this -independent expression of zk

(11)

and it is in agreement with the perturbative diagrammatic computation [18]. actually the usual perturbative approach
in this case is very simple since it involves a one-loop computation and, correspondingly, we need only one integration
of eq. (10) to get the answer, dierently from the d = 4 case where, on one side a two-loop diagram is to be evaluated
and, on the other side, a two step integration of eq. (10) is required [12] to determine the lowest (non-vanishing)
perturbative contribution to . however, the above calculation is similar to the one performed for the 4 theory in
four dimensions since in both cases the anomalous dimension is perturbatively expressed as expansion in powers of
the marginal dimensionless coupling appearing in the potential. the running of these couplings with the scale k is
only logarithmic thus justifying their replacement with the bare constant g3 for d = 6 and g4 for d = 4. the same
argument holds for the eld independent part of zk which is dimensionless and can be replaced with its bare value 1.
the further important step is to check whether this equation is able to reproduce the value of  at the non-gaussian

(wf) xed point which appears in the scalar theory below four dimensions.

in order to get informations at a xed point it is convenient to express all dimensionful quantities in terms of the
running scale k and rewrite the coupled equations (5,10) in terms of dimensionless variables which can be conveniently
introduced through the relations t = ln(k/), x = k(2d)/2(2/nd)1/2, u(x, t) = 2kduk/nd, z(x, t) = kzk. in
these relations powers of nd/2 have also been included in order to get a simpler form of the dierential equations;

indeed the constant  = nd/2 disappears from eqs. (5),(10) after the replacement uk  uk,   , zk  zk.

furthermore, since we are interested in carrying out a numerical analysis of the problem, instead of directly attacking
eq. (5) which contains a logarithm, we shall consider the corresponding equation for the derivative of the potential,
as already performed in [4]. actually the presence of the logarithm causes a stiness of our set of equations which
is a source of many numerical drawbacks. therefore, by rearranging the equations in terms of the derivative of the
scaled potential f (x, t) = u(x, t)/x we nally get the two coupled dierential equations (a = z + f  and this time 
means derivation with respect to x)

and the xed points correspond to t-independent (f /t = z/t = 0) solutions of eqs. (12,13). in the following
part of this section we shall consider only t-independent solutions of eqs. (12,13).

as discussed in [4,8,19], eq. (12) alone allows to determine the xed point structure of the theory and specically the
appearance of the wf xed point is shown for d < 4. it is easy to check that the gaussian xed point, corresponding
to f = 0, z = const 6= 0,  = 0, is a solution of (12,13) for generic d, whereas the determination of the non-gaussian
xed point with the corresponding value of  requires a numerical analysis.
eqs. (12,13) are solved by requiring the usual normalization of the kinetic term in the action and two constraints

on f  and z at x = 0 which preserve the z(2) symmetry   

z(0) = 1

f (0) = 0

z(0) = 0

(14)

as explained in [8], from eqs. (12,13), one can easily determine the asymptotic behavior of the solutions f (x) and
z(x) for large x, up to two (one for each solution) multiplicative constants, cf , cz. thus we have enough boundary
conditions to integrate our equations and to deterimine the three unknown constants cf , cz and . in order to deal
with a two point boundary problem, we have used, as also suggested in [8], the shooting method embedded in a
newton-raphson algorithm [20]. the results shown below have been obtained by requiring that the dierence between
the constraints in (14) and the shooting variables is less than  = 107.

5

in d = 3 the value obtained for the anomalous dimension is  = 0.071, quite dierent from the world best
determination  = 0.035, quoted in [8], or the value determined through the -expansion to the order o(3),  = 0.037
(see [18]). the result is very poor even if compared to the one obtained starting from the equation for zk derived
resorting to a smooth cut-o [8].

however it should be noticed that the situation is less bad if d increases. this is illustrated by comparing the value
obtained for  at the wf xed point in d = 3.4,  = 9.74 103 with the estimate of  obtained from the -expansion
[18] to o(3),  = 10.70 103, and o(4),  = 9.62 103. in d = 3.6 we get  = 4.30 103 to be compared with
the value from the -expansion to o(3),  = 4.16 103 and to o(4),  = 3.95 103. in d = 3.4 and d = 3.6 the
dierences between the various estimates are below 10%. in figs. 1,2,3 we show f (x) and z(x) obtained at the wf
xed point for d = 3, 3.4, 3.6.

all curves for f (x) in fig. 1 intersect the x-axis at non-vanishing values of x, which correspond to non-zero minima
in the potentials; the curves z(x) in d = 3.4 and d = 3.6 are plotted in fig. 2; analogously to what is found in [8]
for the corresponding variable in the smooth cut-o framework in d = 3, z(x) has a maximum and then decreases
for large x (even the dashed curve, although less evidently, smoothly decreases after a maximum at about x = 8).
conversely, as shown in fig. 3, z(x) in d = 3 is increasing: no maximum has been found even enlarging the x range
to the limits allowed by the integration routine (in practice the upper limit can be pushed up to about x = 12).
moreover, close to x = 0, z(x) < 1 and the curve has a minimum which is not present in the curves in fig. 2.

in order to justify this peculiar behavior, we notice that the leading terms within the brackets in the r.h.s. of eq.
(13) are the ones proportional to z and not z, namely (2za2)/(3a3)  (2z2a2)/(da4), that is, as long as d is not
close to 3, these two terms are dominant since z >> z but in d = 3 and in the ultraviolet limit, when a  z  1,
they practically cancel out and the behavior of eq. (13) is sensibly modied.
in conclusion, only close to three dimensions, where the infrared eects become more and more important, eqs.

(12,13) fail to reproduce the known results about the anomalous dimension.

iv. wh equation and non-analytical terms

we now move to another point which, in some sense, is preliminary to the analysis of the coupled equations for the
various parameters entering the local action, namely the rise of some undesirable terms as soon as one goes beyond
the lpa in the derivative expansion. the presence of non-analytical terms has been recognized since long time [21]in
relation with the use of a sharp cut-o and recently reconsidered in [7,22,23]. here, in order to get a clearer insight
into this problem, we shall study the origin of these terms working out the various steps for the determination of the
dierential equation for zk.

let us go back to eq. (3) and (4). the lpa approximation corresponds to setting zk = 1, dropping yk and all the
others higher order derivative coecients and nally restricting to a constant background  = 0. in order to get the
equation for zk, we have to release the condition zk = 1 and collect all terms proportional to  in the r.h.s. of
eq. (3) and, to this purpose, it is necessary to retain a non-constant background (x) = 0 + (x). let us choose
for the non-uniform component of the background (x) a single mode with |q| << k (the reason for this choice will
become apparent later)

(x) =

1

v nqeiqx + qeiqxo

(15)

here v is the volume factor. as before, the uctuation (x), which must be integrated out, contains fourier modes
only in the shell [k  k, k]

(x) =

peipx

1

v x[p]

(16)

the square bracket in eq. (16), [p], is a reminder that the sum is restricted only to those values of p such that
k  k  |p|  k.
therefore the original eld is split into three parts, (x) = 0 + (x) + (x). in order to pick up contributions up to
the second derivative term , the functions uk(0 + (x) + (x)) and zk(0 + (x) + (x)) must be expanded
around 0 up to 2(x), and since the gaussian functional integration is exact, as mentioned before, we only need to
consider terms in (x) up to o(2(x)). due to the condition q << k the linear terms in (x) drop out after the spatial
integration. let us consider now the terms proportional to 2(x). to illustrate the various steps made to derive the
equation and the related problems we do not need to consider here all of them. it will be sucient to consider for
instance those coming from the expansion of the potential. performing the spatial integration with the help of eqs.

one more comment about the notation. all sums above are single summations over p and the range spanned by p
in each sum is obtained by requiring that all quantities in square brackets are constrained into the shell [k  k, k].
for instance in the rst sum in eq. (18), [p] [p  q] indicates the double constraint (k  k)  |p|,|  p  q|  k,
which in turn determines the values of p selected in the summation. then, as soon as we turn on a non-uniform
background (x), we end up with a deformation of the integration region. the new integration region for p is now
given by the overlap of two shells with one of the two depending on q. only at q = 0 the two shells are both reduced
to the original one. the reason for the appearance of the non-analitycal terms has to be traced back to this boundary
eect.

in order to deal with shorter expressions we limit ourselves to the case of a -independent zk. then, with the help
of eqs. (17,18,19), we can easily expand the action sk[0 +  + ] around 0 and perform the quadratic integration
in  obtaining (h = 1)

several comments are in order. this equation has already been derived by following dierent steps in [24,25]. as
already noticed in [12] it is substantially dierent from eq.(10), namely both equations contain the same kind of terms
but with dierent numerical coecients. in the previous section we have already explained that to derive eq. (10),
an expansion where the kinetic term zk(  k2) is considered small w.r. to the potential term zkk2 + u
k is
used. the expansion that leads to eq.(24) is of a completely dierent nature. in this latter case the potential term is
considered small w.r. to the kinetic term. it is then not surprising that we get dierent results. it is well known that
no one of these expansions can be considered as denitely superior to the other. the choice of one of them is rather
dictated by the physical problem under investigation.



it may be stressed at this point that the fact of having derived two evolution equations for zk, namely eqs. (24) and
(10), is not the consequence of having used two dierent denitions of this parameter (which is actually introduced
by the derivative expansion (4) of the action whose evolution is determined by the integration in eq. (3), with the
boundary condition z = 1). rather, it is the consequence of having used two dierent approximations, which in
turn are necessary since the full problem cannot be solved exactly. more specically, as we have just seen, we need
to insert explicitly a non-uniform ( and slowly varying, so that higher derivatives terms in the derivative expansion
can be safely neglected) background eld to read the dierential evolution equation for the coecient zk. now the
uctuation operator
is obviously no longer diagonal in momentum space. to determine then a dierential
equation for zk, we need a further expansion in which a piece of the propagator is considered small with respect to the
rest of the propagator. in the derivation of eqs.(10) and (24) above this additional expansions correspond respectively
to the physical case where the kinetic energy is small with respect to the potential energy and viceversa.

(x)(y)

the method exposed above to obtain eq. (10) is dierent from the methods used respectively in [24] and [25].
nevertheless the expansion adopted in the three cases, namely a small coupling expansion, is the same and this
explains why these methods all lead to the same equation.

finally eq. (24) is obtained by neglecting the boundary eects due to the deformation of the integration shell. let
us now go back to eq. (21) and work out explicitly the consequences of this boundary distortion. to illustrate this
problem we just need to consider one term. let us take for example the term

to further simplify the point, let us write down explicitly the above indicated sum in d = 1 dimensions. the only
additional complications that would appear when considering higher dimensions are some factors coming from the
angular integrations. by trivially replacing the sums with the integrals we get as a result of the overlap of the two
shells (l is the volume of the system)

it must be noted that the companion term in eq.(21), which diers from the one in eq. (26) only for the integration
limits, gives the same result and we do not get any cancellation of the term proportional to q. the above result

8

explains our previous statement that the appearance of non analytic terms in q2 is simply due to the distortion of the
integration domain induced by the non uniform background conguration.

in eq. (26) a term proportional to q appears which is not proportional to k. this in turn seems to imply that
the very possibility to establish a dierential equation for zk is in danger and actually the presence of such terms
has been considered as a serious drawback that blocks the way to any application of the wh method beyond the
lpa approximation. that consideration has convinced some authors that to overcome this problem a smooth cut-o
rather than a sharp cut-o should be used. we shall come back to the smooth cut-o later.

the above derivation actually teaches us that there is no serious drawback as far as we correctly interpret our
equations. the undesired non-analytic terms that appear on the r.h.s. of the dening equation for skk and that
are not contained in the original derivative expansion ansatz, always appear in combination with k as in the example
above. this means that as long as we keep q << k, that is as long as the non-uniformity of the background eld
is small compared to the width of the shell within which the modes are treated as independent, these terms can
be coherently neglected and the equations above are the correct wh rg equations in this approximation. this is
actually one important result of our analysis. the very possibility to implement the rg trasformations as a system
of dierential equations for uk and zk ( i.e. to consider such a truncation to the innite system of equations for all
the coecient functions that appear in the derivative expansion as a good approximation) is intimately related to the
nature of the background eld (x) that we consider. it has to be suciently smooth over the scale k otherwise the
dierential equations simply cease to be valid. the important point here is that not only we learn that it is possible
and perfectly legitimate to establish dierential equations that implement the innitesimal rg transformation even
beyond the lpa approximation, but we also obtain the limit of validity of these equations.

it is worth at this point to pause for a moment and review all the steps and approximations involved in the above

derivation. first note that the wilsonian renormalization group transformation gives:

skk() = skk() + k() + o((k)2)

(27)

from the derivation of eq.(27) it is clear that k is the momentum range above which the modes are considered as
independent, that is any momentum function f (p) that appears in the above equation is practically constant within
this range. this in turn means that we can neglect the o((k)2) terms or, in other words, that the above equation
can be rewritten as a dierential equation. this is what is meant when the above equation is referred as an exact
dierential renormalization group equation and this is also the meaning of the equivalent statement saying that the
gaussian integration is exact. actually all that means that the o((k)2) terms can be consistently neglected.
next we approximate sk by a derivative expansion. we have seen that as soon as we go beyond the lowest order and
allow for a non constant background eld we encounter singularities that make the formal mathematical limit k  0
ill dened. we have seen above that this is none of a problem as far as the scale at which singular terms appear is
kept far from the resolution scale k. this is nothing but the condition q << k.
the two points above can be easily understood by considering the following hydrodynamical example. to give
a dierential form to the equation for, say, the density  of a uid we need two conditions to be satised. the
innitesimal volume d3x has to be suciently small so that the density as well as any other macroscopic quantity
can be considered as constant within this volume. at the same time it has to be suciently large so that a
macroscopic number of molecules is contained within this volume. under the above conditions we can write the
evolution equation for the density in a dierential form because the o((d3x)2) contributions can be neglected and
because due to the second condition we can neglect the singularities coming from the molecular scale a , once
our resolution scale dx has been taken much bigger than a : dx >> a. the complete analogy between the
approximations involved in the derivation of our equations and the hydrodynamical example should be, by now, clear.
obviously the dierential equation for  obtained this way becomes less reliable and ultimately totally wrong when
we want to describe physical phenomena whose resolution scale approaches the molecular scale a. the same warning
applies to our case when the background eld is not suciently smooth within k, and this happens when q  k.
let us now turn our attention to the smooth cut-o procedure. to illustrate the point we can again reconsider
the previous example and implement the constraint in eq.(25) by means of dierences between theta functions in the
following way

(28)

where we have dened 0(p2, k2, (k  k)2) = (p2  (k  k)2)  (p2  k2).
the eect of a smooth cut-o is implemented here by replacing the 0(p2, k2, (k k)2) function with a smoothened
version (p2, k2, (k  k)2) where  has the dimension of a momentum and is a new cut-o that we introduce in
the theory; in the limit   0 it should give 0. it is easy to see that all the non-analytic terms disappear. in fact

9

by expanding the function ((p + q)2, k2, (k  k)2) around p2 we get (from now on we omit k and k  k in the
argument of the  function)

(29)

being now the integration region symmetric all contributions from odd powers of p vanish and consequentely odd
powers of q are absent. as we shall see in a moment we have gained nothing from having made the non-analytic
terms disappear. let us focus on the function  and regard it as a function of |p|. the scale  gives the size of the
region over which  as a function of |p| changes signicantly from zero to one. this means that its rst derivative
with respect to |p| is o( 1
 ) in the two regions around k and k  k, and zero everywhere else. analogously its second
derivative is o( 1
we could expect that  is introduced just as an intermediate step and that the nal results are obtained after sending
 to zero and they are nite. the above result shows that this is not the case. as a consequence of the introduction of
the smoothening cut-o  we have generated 1
 divergences which have already been noticed in [7,22,23]. this could
appear at a rst sight as a disaster and again we might wonder whether it is possible to establish dierential equations
for uk and zk ( and more generally for the coecient functions of the derivative expansion) under these conditions.
actually we can repeat here the same kind of considerations that we have done in connection with the appearance of
the non analytic terms. after performing the integration in the momentum p we see that

the region over which the integrand is signicantly dierent from zero has now a width of  and we get then a factor

let us now comment on the above results. first we make the choice   q, that is a very good choice for 
once we remember its role of smoothening parameter around the points k and k  k and that we want to integrate
essentially only the modes within the shell. it is now apparent that as long as we keep the scale q << k the dominant
contributions come from the terms proportional to (p2) and all the contributions coming from the derivatives of
(p2) can be coherently neglected and the nal output is practically equivalent to the sharp cut-o one.

k(cid:17)4(cid:16) q

an important comment has to be made at this point. the particular choice of the smoothening function  that we
have done above, more precisely the fact that we have chosen it to be an even function of |p|, is responsible for getting
only even powers of q in the above results, in other words we do not get non analytic terms in q2. but this is absolutely
irrelevant because what matters to establish the dierential equations is the condition q << k irrespectively of the
fact that we have odd or even powers of q. in fact had we chosen  to have an odd dependence on |p| we would have
also found odd powers of q. nevertheless under the conditions q << k and q << k, we can equally well neglect all
the terms apart from the rst and again recover the dierential equations.

what we have just seen proves that actually there is no conict between the sharp and the smooth cut-o approach.
these two procedures, once correctly implemented, give precisely the same results as it should be expected. we have
also learned under which conditions the couple of dierential equations for uk and zk are valid.

another additional comment peculiar to the smooth cut-o procedure has to be made. due to the disappearance
of the non-analytic terms there has been in recent years some preference for the smooth cut-o implementation of
the dierential rg transformations w.r. to the sharp cut-o. as we can easily see from the points (i) (ii) and (iii)
a large value of  looks even more ecient in suppressing the undesired terms and we could be led to the conclusion
that we can accomodate such large values of  within the smooth cut-o approach. some results have been recently
derived by making use of this apparent better exibility of the smooth cut-o versus the sharp cut-o. actually the
condition of having a small  ( where small means not too big compared to k) is necessary to be coherent with the
very strategy of the rg method as exposed before. substantially only the modes within the shell have to be integrated
out. by considering larger values of  we move toward the independent mode approximation. the conclusion is that
those results that have been obtained within the framework of the smooth cut-o procedure with the help of cut-o
functions whose typical width is of o(k), where k is the uv cut-o, have to be taken with a grain of salt and the
improvement w.r. to the perturbative result (independent mode approximation) is not very much under control.

10

v. summary and conclusions

we have carefully analysed the derivative expansion for the eective action and shown how the exact renormalization
group equations for the coecient functions uk and zk are obtained. the most important lesson we have learned is
that the system of coupled dierential equations for them can actually be established provided the background eld
around which the quantum uctuations are integrated is suciently smooth. the width k in fourier space measures
the momentum range within which the modes are treated as independent, meaning that any function f (p) that has
to be integrated in the shell [k  k, k] is considered to be constant within it. the key point of the method is that this
shell has to be on the one hand suciently small, i.e. k << k, where k is the uv cut-o, so that the feed-back of the
higher energy modes on the lower ones is correctly taken into account. on the other hand, and this is the crucial point
that we want to emphasize here, it has to be suciently large in such a way that within this range the background
eld can be considered practically at, i.e. q << k. having made clear this point we have seen that the non-analytic
terms are no more source of problems and the dierential equations can be safely established under these conditions.
we have also proven that the introduction of a smooth cut-o practically does not change our conclusions. in fact,
under the conditions quoted above, sharp and smooth cut-o produce precisely the same results. a word of caution
has to be said regarding the results that have been obtained within the smooth cut-o procedure by allowing the
smoothening scale  to take values o(k). in this case the danger is that the width of the shell k gets innitesimal
w.r. to the smoothening scale which means that the modes are practically all treated as independent and then there
is no control on the possible improvement on the perturbative results.

another important point we have learned from the above analysis is that depending on the physical problem at
hand dierent expansions can be envisaged and this lead to dierent equations. the typical situations illustrated are
the one in which the kinetic energy term is considered small compared to the potential and the opposite one. these
two cases respectively produce eq.(10) and eq.(24) above.

one third important result of our analysis is that ( see sec. iii) the study of the coupled system of equations for
uk and zk has shown that we are unable to reproduce the value of  at the wilson-fisher xed point in d = 3
dimensions. our previous results teach us that the reason of this failure is not to be searched in an intrinsic weakness
of the sharp cut-o procedure versus the smooth cut-o. presumably the reason is that we enter a region where the
equations themselves are no longer valid. an indication for that can be seen in the behaviour of zk. when it deviates
from zk = 1, then less smooth congurations play an important role. we may expect that a better result could
be obtained once some other coecient functions of the derivative expansion are added and the new set of coupled
dierential equations derived.
