aspect string (m-) theory dynamics accessible systematic, weak coupling analysis. ref. {$9709093$}, another low energy mechanism stabilizing moduli proposed. scheme, low energy theory, certain approximation, quantum-modied moduli space. authors consider global limit; models yield supersymmetry- conserving minima vanishing cosmological constant coupled gravity. ignoring issue, authors note, generic value gauge coupling order one. possible obtain smaller couplings, models large discrete symmetries. models suciently developed decide whether weak coupling analysis applicable, would argue unlikely sort perturbative treatment non-holomorphic quantities possible. free anomalies, large discrete r-symmetries require large gauge groups (or large matter content) . lead problems calculability identical described above. even anomalies cancelled green-schwarz mechanism, dicult avoid large groups. 6 conclusions conceptually, dicult issue understanding moduli stabilized string theory understanding couplings weak unied, large hierarchies. certainly hard imagine moduli stabilized way couplings dimensionless ratios order one. large pure numbers arise theory without small parameters distinctly puzzling. racetrack scheme variants reviewed probably concrete proposals moduli stabilized weak gauge coupling. seen order one obtain small couplings controllable 15 approximation, degree ne tuning required: gaugino condensation origin moduli superpotential, one must least three gauge groups closely related -functions; theories unbroken discrete r symmetry, one needs two groups elaborate eld symmetry structure. cases, everything calculable, holomorphic quantities superpotential gauge coupling functions may be. supersymmetry broken intermediate energy scales, many quantities computable. supersymmetry broken low energies, likely many quantities relevant low energy physics could be. comparing proposals modulus stabilization string theory, racetrack model certain appeal. ne-tuning unattractive, dont explicit examples provide complete realization, scenario quite concrete. described here, oers hope computing gauge couplings superpotential. supersymmetry broken low energies, many quantities relevant low energy physics might computable. kahler stabilization, contrast, invokes uncontrollable unknown corrections kahler potential. racetrack scenario, certain holomorphic quantities calculable, gauge couplings. hard reconcile mechanism low energy supersymmetry breaking. maximally enhanced symmetry, possessing certain economy, requires mysterious mechanism gauge couplings quite small, suggest low energy supersymmetry breaking, likely oer hope computing even holomorphic quantities. much interest recently possibility large internal dimensions. rst well-developed proposal type appeared {$9806124$}, assumed strong coupling limit heterotic string, compactication calabi-yau space appro- priate. diculty idea, noted {$9508071$} large radius, supersymmetry higher dimensional theory insures potential vanishes. clearly, however, something like racetrack picture could operate well{$9512004$} scheme {$9806124$}, particular, one two walls, supersymmetry breaking arises dynamics walls. two competing groups could give rise potential moduli, minimum large value radii. regime, again, kahler potential would calculable, gauge couplings holomorphic quantities would be. would presumably mean one could take geometric picture literally; best, would qualita- tively correct. similar remarks apply scenarios stabilization large values geometrical moduli required, e.g. {$9512004$}. 16 also interesting consider possibility dilaton picture inaton (these remarks inspired recent work {$9503173$} well earlier work {$9512004$}). models here, dilaton xed, mass large compared expected scale supersymmetry breaking. perhaps promising, since ination one wants rather large scale. moreover, potential, result discrete ne tuning, rather at. determining whether ination occurs, values relevant scales, requires understanding kahler potential, argued calculable schemes. case, scale potential quite naturally two three orders magnitude planck scale, perhaps leading suitable spectrum density uctuations. determining number e-foldings also requires knowledge kahler potential, plausible number might large. potential function s/n , taking kahler potential order (n )0, simple scaling argument gives ne n 2. words, ne tuning required obtain weak gauge coupling might ne tuning required obtain adequate ination. ination picture requires explicit, plausible, assumptions kahler poten- tial. still, connection tuning required obtain small gauge couplings picture required obtain ination raises possibility two truly correlated;
