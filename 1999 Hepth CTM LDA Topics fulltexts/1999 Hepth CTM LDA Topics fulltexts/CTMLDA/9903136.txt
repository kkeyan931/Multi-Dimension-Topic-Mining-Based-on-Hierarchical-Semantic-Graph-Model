(6). so, anymore vectors, anymore symmetric multivectors. would happen use operatorial representation i.e. = . example, let us build symmetric object two indices would be: ab b well known that, single derivative would transform vector component, double derivative b would transform product two vector components, unless introduce connection . problem check formalism nd manner build anti-symmetric also symmetric tensors eventually even mixed ones. moment let us focus attention symmetric ones. see without connection manner make symmetric even 2-tensor. new crucial ingredient pull construction seems connection . connection object needed parallel transport vectors . dieomorphism = a() space m, connection 8 transform tensor following manner: cb = r c ( l l rm b + 2i rb ) (39) usually people associate connection space endowed metric necessary condition. fact connection also built  space equipped symplectic structure space is. dierence metric spaces that, requirement connection preserve metric scalar product vectors plus torsionless makes connection unique, symplectic spaces analogue requirement connection preserves symplectic scalar product12 make connection unique . even unique important symplectic connection symplectic manifold (see proposition (2.5.2) pag.66 ref. ). details contained appendix. using symplectic connection build following object generalization variable : + iclm al cm (40) prove (see calculations appendix ) , dierently (see eq.(21)), transforms vector dieomorphism generated vector eld a(), i.e: = + bab (41) one thing would like study manner rewrite lie- hamiltonian ow v abbh h function phase-space derivative fhv (14) using variables a. restrict lie-derivatives necessarily hamiltonian system. reason want rewrite fhv using fhv scalar despite fact built objects like tensorial character. seems natural write fhv objects clear tensorial character . let us rst rewrite fhv eq.(14) following way: fhv av icbbv aca (42) exchanged c c respect eq.(14). dierence fhv one eq.(14) zero extra piece would produced av which, v = abbh, zero. extra piece would produced think c c acting inside path-integral anticommutator dierent zero. let us replace (42) using relation 12by symplectic scalar product two vectors v w b mean: v w v aabw b. 9 (40). obtain: fhv = v a icbbv aca mbv m]ca (43) last line equation introduced covariant derivative vectors v dened  ;bv bv + mbv m. covariant derivative well-known  property ;bv transform tensor dieomorphism usual derivative bv not. looking eq.(43) see fhv form fhv eq.(42) replacements: = = ;a (44) (45) covariant quantity (a scalar), natural expect would change substitutions replace non-covariant expressions covariant ones. fhv replacement fact fhv eq.(43) same, even written covariant quantities, one (42). using analysis could ask question observable o(, , c, c) scalar. answer following: take use relation (40) replace . get functional form , ordinary derivatives replaced covariant derivatives, scalar. let us turn initial issue building symmetric tensors. something failed  using . thing succeeded building  anti-symmetric tensors using c. let us note that, besides transforming correctly vectors, also commute among themselves. thanks properties manner build symmetric tensors abnab n (46) this13 settles one points clear . seems really impossible formalism manner build mixed tensors. reader may tempted build strings objects containing c like p = p abclmnabc clcmcn, anti-symmetric exchange c among symmetric exchange among c mixed tensor. 13 reader remember mean commuting among operatorial sense sense considering c c entering grassmannian variables anti- commutes among themselves. c acquires operatorial meaning c inserted path-integral. here,instead, building tensors eq.(46) need use path-integral all, commutes among themselves. 10 4 geometric structure. section try understand kind space one labeled 8n coordinates (, , c, c) correct wrong statements present  . said end section 2 base-space considered one labeled (, c). let us rst nd kind space this. 2n coordinates phase-space m. ca transform dieomorphism (see eq.(16)) forms da. stated refs.   that, identifying c d, space (a, ca) makes cotangent bundle  phase space: m. wrong !. fact ca basis ber m. c basis belong called  bundle linear frames to14 m. (a, ca) nothing else section linear-frame-bundle15. say section basis (or frames), besides ca, one could choose bers linear-frame-bundle. generic vector stressed structure holds one identies ca da. identication ref.  used turn whole cartan calculus operations could done via path-integral structures (commutators, brs charges, etc) present it. course fact ca transforms da force us identify explicitly done ref. . example build generic vector eld v v , would components v transforms ca, could identication ca would components (and basis) vectors tangent bers would make tangent bundle phase-space m. problem ca grassmannian nature like v bosonic one. case bundle called  reversed parity tangent bundle indicated m. next consider role 4n remaining variables (a, ca). looking lagrangian (1) see play role momenta variables (a, ca), make cotangent bers previous space. summarize following scheme: (a) = (a, ca) = (a, ca, a, ca) = (t m) (47) (48) (49) hand ref.  (eq.3.33) proved ca act, operatorial counterpart path-integral, ca = ca . moreover previous section 14actually bundle-of-linear-frames made basis tangent bers cotangent bers, two isomorphic. 15that way look variables one basically adopted, without realizing it, refs.   previous three sections paper. 11 paper proved , despite strange transformation properties (6), still maintain operatorial meaning being: = . two expressions say (a, ca) form basis tangent bers base-space (a, ca). base-space m, over-all 8n coordinates (a, ca, a, ca) also considered section bundle linear frames m. alternative interpretation 8n variables respect interpretation contained eq.
