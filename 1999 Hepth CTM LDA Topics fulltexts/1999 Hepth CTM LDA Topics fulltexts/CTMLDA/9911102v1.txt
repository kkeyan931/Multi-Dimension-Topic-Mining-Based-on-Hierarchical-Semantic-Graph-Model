abstract

recent astrophysical observations seem to indicate that the cosmological

constant is small but nonzero and positive. the old cosmological constant

problem asks why it is so small; we must now ask, in addition, why it is

nonzero, and why it is positive.

in this essay, we try to kill these three

metaphorical birds with one stone. that stone is the unimodular theory

of gravity, which is the canonical theory of gravity, except for the way the

cosmological constant arises in the theory.

until recent years, there used to be only one well-known problem [1] with the cosmological

constant, viz., why it is so small  some 120 orders of magnitude smaller than what we

naively think it should be.

if it is that small, it must be zero, so some of us thought.

now we know better. the recent astrophysical observations indicate that, quite likely, the

cosmological constant is not zero, though small, and positive, giving rise to cosmic repulsion.

[2] we are automatically invited to ask these additional questions: why is the cosmological

constant not zero? why does it have the observed magnitude, contributing to the energy

density of the observable universe about twice as much as matter?

in this essay, we will attempt to present a qualitative solution to these three problems

of the cosmological constant. we will do so in the framework of unimodular gravity [37]

which, as we will show, is nothing but the canonical theory of gravity  except for one

curious twist which has to do with the way the cosmological constant arises in the theory.

first let us reiterate the cosmological constant problems and put them in a form that

will be useful later in the essay. from the einstein-hilbert action of gravity, we know that

the cosmological constant  has units of the reciprocal of length squared. until recent

years, all galactic observations had failed to detect any spacetime distortions that one can

attribute to a nonzero cosmological constant out to the farthest distance, about 1028 cm.,

in the observable universe. denote the 4-volume of the observable universe by v , then

the empirical observations give the bound  < v 1/2. but theoretical expectations would
predict a much larger value:   l2
p with lp  1033cm being the planck length. this vast
discrepancy by 122 orders of magnitude constitutes the old cosmological constant problem:

why is  so small? recent observations [8] (supernovae 1a, cosmic microwave background,

cluster density and evolution etc) are consistent with a geometrically at universe and they

indicate that the cosmological constant contributes about 70% of the energy density; hence

(1)

the cosmological constant is non-zero (and positive) after all.

two observations are now in order. first, it is not surprising that  is non-zero since

2

setting  = 0 does not enhance the existing symmetry of the gravitation theory. second, the

(old) cosmological constant problem is insensitive to the non-renormalizability of quantized

general relativity as the problem occurs well below the planck scale (even the relatively small

vacuum energy density in qcd yields a discrepancy of about 42 orders of magnitude). thus

it seems reasonable that one can adequately address the cosmological constant problems in

the framework of a gravity theory whose classical limit resembles general relativity. in the

following, we consider the unimodular theory of gravity.

unimodular gravity is actually very well motivated on physical grounds. following

wigner [9] for a proper quantum description of the massless spin-two graviton, the mediator

in gravitational interactions, we naturally arrive at the concept of gauge transformations.

[3] without loss of generality, we can choose the gravitons two polarization tensors to be

traceless (and symmetric). but since the trace of the polarization states is preserved by all

the transformations, it is natural to demand that the graviton states be described by trace-

less symmetric tensor elds. the strong eld generalization of the traceless tensor eld is a

metric tensor g that has unit determinant: detg  g = 1, hence the name unimodular
gravity.

at rst sight, the unimodular constraint has greatly changed the gravitational eld equa-

tion, since now only the traceless combinations appear:

r  1/4gr = 8g(t   1/4gt 
 ),

(2)

where t  is the conserved matter stress tensor. but in conjunction with the bianchi identity
for the covariant derivative of the einstein tensor, the eld equation yields d(r8gt 
0. denoting that constant of integration by 4, we nd

 ) =

r  1/2gr = g  8gt ,

(3)

the familiar einsteins equation. the only dierence from the canonical theory is in the way

 arises in the theory  it is an (arbitrary) integration constant, unrelated to any parameter

in the original action. there are two other dierences [3] that are worth mentioning. (1)

3

unlike the canonical theory, the lagrangian for unimodular gravity can be expressed as a

polynomial of the metric eld. (2) conformal transformations g = c 2g 

 in the unimodular

theory of gravity are very simple, the unimodular constraint xes the conformal factor c to

be 1.

since  arises as an arbitrary constant of integration, it has no preferred value classically.

in the corresponding quantum theory, we expect the state vector of the universe to be

given by a superposition of states with dierent values of  and the quantum vacuum

functional to receive contributions from all dierent values of . for the quantum theory,

it is advantageous to start with a generalized version of the classical unimodular theory

given above, that is generally covariant while preserving locality. we will use the version of

unimodular gravity given by the henneaux and teitelboim action [6]

sunimod = 

1

16g z [g(r + 2)  2t ](d3x)dt.

(4)

one of its equations of motion is g = t , the generalized unimodular condition. note
that, in this theory,  plays the role of momentum conjugate to the coordinate r d3xt0
which can be identied, with the aid of the generalized unimodular condition, as the space-

time volume v [10]. hence  and v are conjugate to each other.

we are ready to argue why the observed cosmological constant is so small. the argument

[4] makes crucial use of quantum mechanics. consider the vacuum functional for unimodular
gravity given by path integrations over t , g, the matter elds (to be represented by ),
and :

zm inkowski = z d()z d[]d[g]z d[t ]exp {i[sunimod + sm (, g)]} ,

(5)

where sm stands for the contribution from matter elds (and d() denotes the measure of
the  integration). the integration over t  yields (), which implies that  is spacetime-
independent (beting its role as the cosmological constant). a wick rotation now allows

us to study the euclidean vacuum functional z. the integrations over g and  give

exp[s(g, )] where g and  are the background elds which minimize the eective

4

action s. a curvature expansion for s yields a lagrangian whose rst two terms are the
einstein-hilbert terms g(r+2) where  now denotes the fully renormalized cosmological

constant. we can make a change of variable from the original (bare)  to the renormalized

. let us assume that for the present cosmic era,  is essentially in the ground state,

then it is reasonable to neglect the eects of . to continue, we follow baum [11] and

hawking [12] to evaluate s(g, 0). for negative , s is positive; for positive , one nds
s(g, 0) = 3/g, so that

z = z d()exp(3/g).

(6)

the essential singularity of the integrand at  = 0+ means that the overwhelmingly most

probable conguration is the one with  = 0, and this in turn implies that the observed

cosmological constant in the present era is essentially zero.

there is one serious shortcoming in the above argument involving the wick rotation

to euclidean space. it is well-known that the euclidean formulation of quantum gravity is

plagued by the conformal factor problem, due to divergent path-integrals. in our defense, we

want to point out that we have used the eective action in the euclidean formulation at its

stationary point only. we should also recall that the conformal factor problem is arguably

rather benign in the original version of unimodular gravity (as pointed out above), so perhaps

it is not that serious even in the generalized version that we have just employed. there is

another cause for concern. since part of the above argument bears some resemblance to

colemans wormhole approach [13], one may worry that some of the objections to colemans

argument (on top of the conformal factor problem) may also apply here. fortunately, it

appears that they do not. [14] in any case, to the extent that our argument is valid, we have

understood why the observed cosmological constant is so small and why, if the cosmological

constant is not exactly zero, it is positive.

in the above argument, we have assumed that for the present cosmic era, the matter

elds are in their ground states so that their eects on the eective action can be neglected;

and the end result is that the observed  is zero. plausible as this assumption is, it is not

5

entirely correct. so, we do expect a non-vanishing (but small) cosmological constant for the

present era, and  goes to zero only asymptotically as the universe expands. regrettably,

we have not been able to calculate the small but not-entirely-negligible eects of the matter

elds on the eective action. we will adopt the attitude that the above result is valid to the

lowest order of approximation for which  is zero. we will now borrow an argument due to

sorkin [7] to make an order of magnitude estimate of the cosmological constant (to the next

leading order). [15]

there are two ingredients to sorkins argument. first, from unimodular gravity he

takes the idea that  is in some sense conjugate to the spacetime volume v . hence their

uctuations obey a heisenberg-type uncertainty principle,

v  1,

(7)

where we have used the natural units (h = 1, g = 1). the second ingredient to sorkins

argument does not seem to be related to the unimodular theory of gravity. it is drawn from

the causal-set theory [16], which stipulates that continous geometries in classical gravity

should be replaced by causal-sets, the discrete substratum of spacetime. the uctuation

in the number of elements n making up the set is of the poisson type, i.e., n  n . for

a causal set, the spacetime volume v becomes n. it follows that

v  n 

n 

v .

(8)

putting eqs. (7) and (8) together yields a minimum uncertainty in  of   v 1/2. [17]
but we have already argued that  vanishes to the lowest order of approximation and that

it is positive if it is not zero. so we conclude that  uctuates about zero with a magnitude

of v 1/2 and it is positive:

 +

1
v

,

(9)

which, lo and behold, is eq. (1)! the cosmological constant is small, but non-zero and

positive, and has the correct order of magnitude as observed. in other words,  contributes

6

to the energy of the universe an amount on the order of the critical density. as a side

remark, we note that if we now appeal to the inationary universe scenario, we can also

understand why matter contributes a comparable amount. [18]

in summary, we have proposed to understand why the cosmological constant is so small

but non-zero and positive in the framework of the unimodular theory of gravity. this theory

is well motivated, based on the quantum description of massless spin-two particles. it leads

to a theory of gravity in which the cosmological constant is freed to become dynamical 
it evolves with time as 1/v with v being the spacetime volume. [19] admittedly, our

argument above is not completely satisfactory; part of it may even be awed. but hopefully,

our scenario is correct. may this essay provoke further productive works towards the solution

of the vexing cosmological constant problems and the physics beyond.

[18] thus we may have ameliorated the cosmic coincidence problem of why both matter

and the cosmological constant contribute comparable amounts to the energy density of

the universe in the present era.

[19] how far back to the early universe one can extrapolate this result is an interesting

question.
