abstract

we construct the complete and explicit non-linear kaluza-klein ansatz for deriving the

bosonic sector of the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged four-dimensional supergravity from the

reduction of d = 11 supergravity on s 7. this provides a way of interpreting all bosonic

solutions of the four-dimensional gauged theory as exact solutions in eleven-dimensional

supergravity. we discuss certain limiting forms of the kaluza-klein reduction, and compare
them with related forms in the freedman-schwarz n = 4 su (2)  su (2) gauged theory.
this leads us to the result that the freedman-schwarz model is in fact a singular limiting

case of the standard so(4) gauged supergravity. we show that in this limit, our ansatz

for getting the so(4) gauged theory as an s 7 reduction from d = 11 indeed reduces to an
s 3 s 3 reduction from d = 10, which makes contact with previous results in the literature.
we also show that there is no distinction to be made between having equal or unequal

values for the gauge coupling constants g and g of the two su (2) gauge-group factors in

the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity, whilst by contrast the ratio of g to g is a

non-trivial parameter of the freedman-schwarz model.

introduction

in the conjectured ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3], it becomes important to establish

how the lower-dimensional gauged supergravities arise through spherical kaluza-klein re-

ductions of the fundamental theories in d = 10 or d = 11. it has long been known in certain
cases that at the level of linearised uctuations around an ads  sphere background, the
massless excitations in the kaluza-klein spectrum describe the maximal gauged supergrav-

ity multiplet. the cases where this occurs include d = 11 supergravity compactied on s 7

[4] or s 4 [5], and type iib supergravity compactied on s 5 [6, 7].

what is much less clear is whether these results extend nicely beyond the level of the

linearised analysis. it is obvious that if one performs expansions of all the elds in terms

of complete sets of harmonics on the sphere, then one will necessarily obtain a lower-

dimensional theory comprising the gauged supergravity coupled to an innite tower of

massive multiplets. a priori, one might expect that beyond the linearised level, there could

be couplings of the form h l2, h l3, etc. in the lower-dimensional lagrangian, where h

represents a heavy eld and l a massless one. such couplings would prevent one from

rigorously setting the heavy elds to zero, since the massless elds would be acting as

sources for them. such a phenomenon does not happen in a toroidal reduction, since the

torus harmonics associated with the massless modes are constants, while those associated

with the massive modes depend on the torus coordinates. thus it is guaranteed in that case

that no non-linear products of zero-mode harmonics can generate non-zero-mode harmonics.

the truncation to the massless sector is therefore guaranteed to be consistent in a toroidal

reduction.

on the sphere, the harmonics associated with the massless elds can depend on the co-

ordinates of the sphere (for example, the killing vectors associated with the massless gauge

bosons), and so it is far from obvious that once the non-linear interactions are included,

there will be no couplings linear in heavy elds, of the kind we discussed above. quite

the contrary, in fact; it is easy to see that in general such terms will be present, and so a

generic theory reduced on a sphere cannot be consistently truncated to the massless sector.

remarkably, however, it turns out that these consistency problems are avoided in the case

of the sphere reductions of d = 11 supergravity. for the s 7 reduction, indications of this

were seen in [8, 9], and a complete demonstration of the consistency of the truncation was

given in [10]. for the s 4 reduction, the explicit reduction ansatz was recently constructed

[11], again showing that the truncation to the massless sector is consistent. no analogous

result has been derived for the s 5 reduction of type iib supergravity, but it is strongly

1

believed to work there too.

the kaluza-klein ansatze for the complete s 7 and s 4 reductions are rather complicated

(the s 7 case is especially complicated, and indeed the reduction scheme obtained in [10] is

somewhat implicit, which is presumably inevitable since the n = 8 gauged theory is itself

intrinsically rather complicated). in a number of recent papers, completely explicit consis-

tent reduction ansatze have been constructed for various further (consistent) truncations

of the maximal gauged supergravities. the advantage of looking at these smaller theories

is that the expressions for the ansatze become much more manageable, and it becomes

possible to present fully explicit results. these results are completely sucient if one is in-

terested in knowing how to embed lower-dimensional solutions that use only the truncated

subset of elds into the original theory in d = 10 or d = 11. cases that have been worked

out in this way include truncations to the maximal abelian subgroups u (1)4, u (1)3 and

u (1)2 of the full so(8), so(6) and so(5) gauge groups in d = 4, 5 and 7 [12]. cases with

surviving non-abelian gauge groups have also been constructed; the n = 1 su (2) gauged
supergravity in d = 7 [13], and the n = 4 gauged su (2)  u (1) supergravity in d = 5
[14]. the former arises from an s 4 reduction from d = 11, while the latter comes from an

s 5 reduction from type iib supergravity. another case that has been obtained is n = 2

su (2) gauged supergravity in d = 6 [15]. this is in fact the largest gauged theory that

exists in d = 6 [16], even though ungauged supergravity with n = 4 exists in d = 6. the

six-dimensional theory arises from a local s 4 reduction of massive type iia supergravity

[15].1 an explicit ansatz for the embedding of the symmetric scalar potential of d = 5

gauged supergravity into the metric of type iib was also obtained, in [17] (see also [18]).

this was extended to the full consistent embedding, giving the ansatz also for the 5-form

antisymmetric tensor (the only other active eld in this truncation) in [19]. the results were

also extended to the full consistent reduction ansatze for the symmetric scalar potentials

of d = 7 and d = 4 gauged supergravities from d = 11, and for the analogous scalar

potential in d = 6 gauged supergravity from massive type iia, in [19].

the consistency of the reduction is of particular importance in the context of the

ads/cft correspondence. one is interested in considering p-brane congurations in the
higher dimension that carry a large charge n , in the limit when n  . from the lower-
dimensional point of view, this corresponds to congurations such as charged ads black

holes where the gauge elds that support the solution take large values. if, heuristically

speaking, the massless elds denoted by l are taking very large values then it is crucial

1in all cases, attention has been focussed on the bosonic sectors of the supergravities, since these are the

elds that participate in p-brane solutions.

2

that there should be no h l2, h l3, etc. , couplings in the theory, in order that the neglect

of the massive elds h can be justied.

in this paper, we shall construct another example where an explicit consistent reduction

can be obtained. we consider the case of n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity in d = 4.2

of course in principle the reduction ansatz for this theory should be subsumed in the

n = 8 reduction described in [10]. in practice, as we have indicated, the results in [10]

are somewhat implicit, and furthermore the full results for the reduction of the d = 11

4-form eld strength are not presented there. (the metric reduction ansatz, on the other

hand, is given explicitly, and in fact we make use of the metric reduction given in [10] in

obtaining our results.) this n = 4 example is rather more complicated than previous ones

that have been explicitly considered. in particular, the bosonic eld content includes not

only a dilaton but also an axion, and this leads to a more involved structure in the reduction

ansatze. as usual, the bulk of the complexity in determining the reduction ansatze centres

around the antisymmetric tensor elds.

in section 2 we present our results for the consistent kaluza-klein reduction ansatz,

including a discussion of the geometry of the internal 7-sphere.

in section 3 we present

the lagrangian and the equations of motion for the four-dimensional n = 4 so(4) gauged

supergravity, and in section 4 we discuss how our kaluza-klein ansatz produces this theory

as an exact embedding in d = 11 supergravity. in section 5, we discuss certain singular

limits of the reduction, and we compare them with related limits in the freedman-schwarz
n = 4 su 2)  su (2) gauged supergravity. we show that in fact the freedman-schwarz
model can be understood as a singular limit of the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged theory,

in which the axion is shifted by an innite constant. the s 7 internal space degenerates
to ir  s 3  s 3 in this limit. we also show that in the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged
theory, there is no distinction to be made between the cases of equal or unequal gauge

coupling constants g and g for the two su (2) factors in the gauge group, since one can

make rescalings that allow the ratio to be adjusted at will.

(this observation was also

made in [24, 23].) by contrast, no such rescalings are possible in the freedman-schwarz

model, and so there the ratio g/g is a non-trivial parameter of the theory. after concluding

remarks, we present details in appendix a of the derivation of the metric reduction ansatz.

2we should emphasise that here we are, intitially, discussing the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged theory

of [20], not the freedman-schwarz n = 4 su (2)  su (2) gauged theory of [21]. in section 5, however, we

show that the latter is a singular limit of the former.

in this section, we present our results for the kaluza-klein reduction ansatz for obtaining

a number of remarks about the reduction ansatz are in order. first, we note that there

is a residual z2 subgroup of the original global sl(2, ir) symmetry of the ungauged theory,

under which the various quantities are mapped to their primed images, given by

x = ex ,

c = s ,

 x2 =  x 2 ,
s = c ,

hi = hi ,

 (3) = (3) .

(1) = eai

(1) ,
hi = hi ,

i
(1) = ai

(1) ,

(15)

in particular, we have  = , q = q and u = u . in fact, the entire ansatz for the metric

and 4-form is invariant under the z2. it corresponds to an interchange of the two 3-spheres
in our description of s 7 as a foliation of s 3  s 3. correspondingly, in the four-dimensional
theory itself, the z2 symmetry involves an interchange of the two su (2) gauge elds.

the geometry of the internal 7-sphere can be understood as follows. if we look at the

metric ansatz (1) in the unexcited state where the gauge elds, axion and dilaton vanish
2 g2 the internal 7-dimensional

metric becomes

(and so x = ex = 1), we see that up to a constant factor of 1

7 is a metric on the unit 7-sphere, with the latitude coordinate  running between the

limits 0    1
2 , at which one or other of the two 3-spheres shrinks to zero radius. this
geometrical description of the 7-sphere is analogous to the description of a s 3 as a foliation
of cliord tori s 1  s 1, in which one has d2

(we have chosen to set the two gauge couplings for the two su (2) gauge groups equal here.

there is no loss of generality involved in doing this; one can always restore the two coupling

constants by shifting  by a constant, accompanied by appropriate rescalings of  and the

gauge potentials. we shall return to this point in section 5.)

4 reduction from d = 11 to d = 4

in section 2 we presented our results for the ansatze for the metric tensor and 4-form

eld strength of eleven-dimensional supergravity, which, when substituted into the eleven-

dimensional equations of motion, give rise to the equations of motion for the four dimen-

sional n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity. we arrived at the ansatz for the metric by

a combination of generalisation from the previously known abelian case in [12], and the

general formula presented in [10], as described in appendix a. our procedure for determin-

ing the 4-form eld strength ansatz consisted of a combination of generalisation from the

abelian case in [12], together with a trial and error process of introducing additional terms

as necessary until consistency was achieved. thus our criterion for determining the ansatz

was to verify explicitly that substituting it into the eleven-dimensional equations of motion

gave a consistent reduction to the four-dimensional equations of motion. (in particular,

the most non-trivial part is nding an ansatz that is consistent, in the sense that all the

dependence on the  coordinate of the 7-sphere cancels out in all the equations.)

we shall not present all the details of the substitution of the ansatz here, because the

procedure is an involved one, and in fact parts of it were most conveniently checked by

computer. however, it is useful to summarise the structure of the calculation. the d = 11
equations of motion, and the bianchi identity for f(4), are given by

rm n = 1

12 ( f 2

m n  1

12

f 2

(4) gm n ) ,

8

d f(4) =  1
d f(4) = 0 .

2

f(4)  f(4) ,

(27)

considering rst the bianchi identity, it is evident from (5), (9) and (10) that since the four-
dimensional hodge duals dx, d, f i
(2) appear in the ansatz for f(4), it must
be that d f(4) = 0 will not be satised as an identity, but rather it will imply certain of the
four-dimensional equations of motion. specically, d f(4) = 0 implies the d = 4 yang-mills

(2) and ef i

equations, and a particular combination of the equations of motion for the dilaton and the

axion.

the d = 11 eld equation for f(4) gives rise separately to the four-dimensional equations

of motion for the dilaton, the axion, and the yang-mills elds. finally, the various com-

ponents of the eleven-dimensional einstein equation give rise again to the four-dimensional

dilaton, axion and yang-mills equations, and also the four-dimensional einstein equation.

two comments are in order. firstly, we remark that, as always in these examples of non-

trivial consistent sphere reductions, the consistency is achieved only because of remarkable

conspiracies between the contributions from the metric and the antisymmetric tensor

in the higher-dimensional theory. thus in this case it is only because of the precise eld

content, and the structure, of the eleven-dimensional theory that it is possible to obtain a

consistent reduction ansatz in which all the dependence on the coordinates of the internal

7-sphere cancels out when the ansatz is substituted into the eleven-dimensional equations

of motion.

the second comment is that, as in most of the other cases of consistent sphere reductions,

we see here also that the ansatz for the antisymmetric tensor must be made on the eld
strength f(4), rather than on the fundamental potential a(3). this is evident from the
fact that the four-dimensional hodge duals of dx, d, f i

(2) appear in the ansatz

(2) and ef i

(5), (10) (as well as the undualised elds). as we remarked above, this means that the
bianchi identity for f(4) is not satised identically, but rather as a consequence of the four-

dimensional equations of motion. consequently, there is no way to write an explicit ansatz
for the potential a(3), since if we could, d f(4) = 0 would be a true identity. the upshot from

this is that the kaluza-klein sphere reduction must necessarily be discussed at the level of

the higher-dimensional equations of motion; it is not possible to describe the reduction at

the level of substituting an ansatz into the higher-dimensional lagrangian.

5 gauge-coupling limits

in this section, we address two main topics. firstly, we show how in the standard n = 4

so(4) gauged supergravity, the case with independent su (2) coupling constants g and

g can be derived from the the case where g = g, just by eld redenitions. thus there

is really no greater generality when the coupling constants are unequal, in the standard

so(4) gauged theory.

it is, however, useful to introduce the articial extra parameter

for the purpose of discussing singular limits. in the second part of this section, we rst

observe that if one or other of the su (2) coupling constants is set to zero in the standard

so(4) gauged supergravity, the theory becomes equivalent to the the similar limit of the
freedman-schwarz su (2)  su (2) gauged theory. then, we show a more surprising result,
which is that the full freedman-schwarz theory with g and g both non-zero can in fact be

derived as a singular limit of the standard so(4) gauged theory. this is a limit where the

axion  is shifted by an innite constant, accompanied by appropriate constant rescalings

of certain other elds and coupling constants. we show how in this limit, the previous
s 7 reduction ansatz reduces to an ir  s 3  s 3 reduction, which can be interpreted as
an s 3  s 3 reduction from d = 10. this makes contact with previous results [25, 26] for
obtaining the freedman-schwarz model by kaluza-klein reduction.

5.1 n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity with g 6= g from g = g
to begin, let us show how we can restore the two independent gauge coupling constants g

and g in the n = 4 so(4) gauged theory, one for each su (2) factor in the gauge group. to

do this, we take the lagrangian (17), and make the following eld and coupling constant

redenitions:

 =  + k ,

g = g e

2 k ,

 =  ek ,
g = g e 1

2 k ,

ai

(1) = ai

(1) e

1

2 k ,

(1) = a

eai

i

(1) e 1

2 k ,

(28)

where k is a constant. now dropping the primes, we nd that the lagrangian takes the

identical form (17), where now (18) and (19) have become

v = 8g g  2g2 e  2g2 e  2g2 2 e ,

and

f i

the potential (29) can also be rewritten in various equivalent ways:

(31)

in the second line, we are using the parametrisation of the scalar elds given by (52) in

appendix a. in the nal line, we have written the potential in terms of the complex eld
w = a + i b used in [22], which is related to our  and  by w = ei  tanh 1
coupling constants g = g  g.

2 , and

thus after the rescaling (28), the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity with

g = g is mapped into the formulation with two independent gauge coupling constants that

was presented in [22]. (this was also observed in [23, 24].) as we have seen, it is in fact

identical, modulo eld redenitions, to the original theory obtained in [20] where the two

gauge coupling constants were equal.
(it is easy to see from (31) how this equivalence
can pass unnoticed if one uses the (, ) or w = a + i b parametrisation for the scalar
elds.) it is, of course, trivial to substitute the rescalings into the metric and 4-form ansatze

given in section 2, to obtain reduction ansatze where the two gauge coupling constants are

dierent.

5.2 freedman-schwarz as a limit of n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity

having obtained the n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity with independent su (2) coupling

constants g and g, the possibility of taking interesting singular limits arises. first, we may

consider the situation where we set g = 0, whereupon the potential v becomes

v = 2g2 e .

(32)

su (2) gauge coupling constants is also set to zero. (this observation was also made in [22].)

(1) just become abelian u (1)3 in this limit. the theory
in this limit is equivalent to the limit of the freedman-schwarz model in which one of its

of course the su (2) gauge elds eai
the equivalence can be made explicit by dualising the elds eai

because they are abelian). this gives precisely the g = 0 limit of the freedman-schwarz

(1) (which can now be done

model (see equation (33) below). note that instead taking the limit where g = 0 rather

than g = 0 is equivalent, after a eld redenition.

one might now wonder if it could be possible to obtain the complete freedman-schwarz

model, with both gauge coupling constants non-zero, as a suitable limit of the standard

n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity given by (17). as we shall now show, this is indeed the

case. let us rst present the bosonic lagrangian for the freedman-schwarz theory [21]:

(34)

and gauge eld strengths given by (30).

a natural attempt to obtain this as a limit from (17) is to redene the elds and coupling

constants in (17), (29) and (30) according to

 =  + b ,

(1) = b a

i
(1) ,

g = g b1 ,

(35)

eai

(with all other elds and constants left unscaled), where b is a constant.

indeed, upon

sending b to innity and dropping the primes, we nd that (17) becomes precisely (33)

with the potential v given by (34), and the eld strengths given by (30).3 (the eect of

reversing the sign of the dilaton coupling from e to e in the kinetic term for ef i

is normally accomplished by dualisation, is instead achieved here by this singular limiting

(2), which

process.)

normally, one would say that the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity and the
freedman-schwarz n = 4 su (2)su (2) gauged supergravity are intrinsically inequivalent.
this can be understood from the fact that they correspond to gauging two dierent formu-

lations of the same n = 4 ungauged theory, which are related by a dualisation involving

the gauge elds [27]. the processes of gauging and dualisation do not commute (since one

cannot dualise non-abelian yang-mills elds), and so the gauged theories can no longer be

equivalent. thus normally, one would say that to relate the standard so(4) gauged the-

ory to the freedman-schwarz theory, it would be necessary to ungauge one theory, dualise,

and then regauge it.

an intriguing outcome of our work is that there is another way of achieving the same

eect, by taking a singular limit. since the limit is singular, one should perhaps still view

the two gauged theories as being in some sense inequivalent. however, one theory seems to

be more inequivalent than the other, since we can derive freedman-schwarz as a singular

limit of the standard so(4) gauged theory, but the arrow cannot be reversed.4

one can also verify that the supersymmetry transformation laws of the standard so(4)

gauged theory do indeed produce those of the freedman-schwarz gauged theory when the

b   limit of (35) is taken. we shall not present all the details here, but just the
extra terms in the spin- 3

gauged theories. from [22], and using the notation of that paper, these extra terms in the

2 and spin- 1

so(4) gauged theory are

(36)

where a, b and g were dened in section 5.1. making the replacements (35), and then
sending b to innity, we nd that there are exact cancellations of terms linear in b, which

would otherwise have been divergent, leaving an overall nite result, namely

 i = 12

(37)

these are precisely the correct forms of the corresponding extra terms in the transforma-

tion rules of the freedman-schwarz model [21]. the rest of the terms in the transformation

rules similarly all map over appropriately.

it is of interest to see what happens to our kaluza-klein reduction ansatz if this limit is

taken. for the metric ansatz (1), we nd that as b becomes very large, the metric becomes

where we have dened a new coordinate  by  = b 1
ansatz for the 4-form eld strength, given in (5), (9) and (10), reduces to

2  + 1

2 g2 d  (3)
(2)  hi(cid:17) .

(2)  hi + 1

(39)

we see that the metric ansatz has an overall b2/3 constant factor, while the 4-form ansatz

has an overall b factor. these in fact precisely cancel out when the ansatze are substituted

into the eleven-dimensional equations of motion (27), since there is a scaling symmetry in

d = 11 under

gm n  e2k gm n ,

am n p  e3k am n p .

(40)

thus even though b is being sent to innity, the ansatz still gives a sensible limit. in fact

using (40), we can eectively set b to any desired value in (38) and (39). it is convenient to

take b = 2.

13

the ansatze (38) and (39) can be reinterpreted as a rst reduction step from d = 11 to
d = 10 on the  killing direction, followed by a reduction on s 3  s 3. to go from d = 11
to d = 10 we follow the standard kaluza-klein prescription, with

(41)

where f(4) = da(3)  da(2) a(1) and f(3) = da(2) (the eld-strength reduction follows from
a(3) = a(3) + a(2)  d.) comparing with (38) and (39), we see that in the d = 10 type iia
theory we shall have

a(1) = 0 .

thus only the ns-ns elds of the type iia theory are active (the metric, the dilaton ,
and the 3-form eld strength f(3)), while the r-r elds f(4) and f(2) = da(1) are zero.
the reduction ansatz (42) can therefore also be interpreted as a reduction in the type i

or heterotic string.
it is easy to check that it agrees precisely with the reduction given
in [25, 26], for obtaining the freedman-schwarz model as an s 3  s 3 reduction of the
heterotic theory. this singular limit of the s 7 reduction is reminiscent of examples discussed

previously in [28].

once again, the one-way nature of the limiting procedure can be seen in the kaluza-
klein reduction. one can take a singular limit in which s 7 becomes ir  s 3  s 3, but one
cannot reverse the process and obtain s 7 as a limit of ir  s 3  s 3.

it is interesting to note that no analogue of the scaling (28) arises in the freedman-

schwarz model. as we showed, in the standard n = 4 so(4) gauged theory this scaling

means that there is really no distinction between the situation where the gauge coupling

constants g and g of the two su (2) factors in the gauge group are equal or unequal. on

the other hand, the absence of such a scaling transformation in the freedman-schwarz case

means that the ratio between its su (2) coupling constants g and g is a genuine parameter

of the theory, with no redenition that maps one value into another.

6 conclusion

in this paper, we have constructed the complete, non-linear, explicit kaluza-klein ansatz

for obtaining the bosonic sector of four-dimensional n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity

by dimensional reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s 7. although in principle

subsumed by the n = 8 reduction constructed in [10], the advantage of our n = 4 truncation

is that the resulting four-dimensional theory is much simpler than the maximal n = 8

theory, and consequently the reduction ansatz is much more manageable.

in fact it is

because of this simplication that we have been able to construct a fully explicit kaluza-

klein reduction.

the key point, in fact, is that the surviving gauge group in the truncation, namely

so(4), is the product of two su (2) factors, and the gauge bosons for these factors arise

from two separate 3-spheres in the parameterisation of the internal 7-sphere as a foliation
of s 3  s 3 hypersurfaces. thus we are able to benet from the fact that the 3-spheres
are themselves su (2) group manifolds. a group manifold g has a g  g isometry group,
comprising independent left-translations and right-translations under g. since we need

only include the gauge bosons associated with the left-translations on each 3-sphere, the

corresponding deformations of the 3-spheres preserve their homogeneity. thus although the

7-sphere itself is distorted inhomogeneously when the lower-dimensional elds are excited,

these inhomogeneities are limited to co-dimension 1, corresponding to a distortion of the
foliation whilst keeping the s 3  s 3 surfaces themselves homogeneous. for this reason, the
dependence of the ansatz on the coordinates of the internal 7-sphere is restricted to the

latitude coordinate  that parameterises the foliating surfaces. it is still, of course, highly

non-trivial that the overall  coordinate dependence cancels out in the eleven-dimensional

equations of motion under the kaluza-klein reduction.

using the results obtained in this paper, any bosonic solution of four-dimensional n = 4

so(4) gauged supergravity can be oxidised back to an exact solution of eleven-dimensional

supergravity.

we have shown that the n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity really has only one genuine

gauge-coupling parameter, and that although one can introduce independent parameters

g and g for the two su (2) gauge groups, this is nothing but a redenition of elds in the

theory with g = g. this is a dierent situation from the freedman-schwarz model, where

the two gauge couplings are genuinely independent parameters, which cannot be set equal

by eld redenitions.

we have also shown that the freedman-schwarz model arises as a singular limit of the

15

standard n = 4 so(4) gauged supergravity, in which the axion is shifted by an innite

constant, together with appropriate rescalings of other elds. we have shown how this

translates, in our kaluza-klein reduction, to a limiting case where the 7-sphere degenerates
into the product ir  s 3  s 3.

appendices

a derivation of the reduction ansatz

in this appendix, we present some of the details of how we arrived at the kaluza-klein

metric reduction ansatz that we present in section 2. first, we show how the ansatz can

be deduced, in the absence of the axion, from previous results [12] for the u (1)4 truncation

of four-dimensional maximal gauged supergravity. then, we show how the general results

in [10] allow us to obtain the metric ansatz after the inclusion of the axionic scalar eld.

the nal part of appendix a comprises a collection of useful lemmata for the su (2)-valued

forms that are used in the construction of the ansatz.

a.1 ansatz with axion set to zero

the structure of the embedding of four-dimensional n = 4 gauged so(4) supergravity in

d = 11 can be seen by rst considering the maximal abelian u (1)4 embedding obtained in

[12]. in that case there are three dilatons and three axions in the full u (1)4 theory, although

in the reduction ansatz derived in [12], the axions were set to zero. we can make a further

truncation to u (1)2, by setting pairs of the original four u (1) gauge elds equal. at the

same time, for consistency, two dilatons and two axions are set to zero. in the axion-free

situation described in [12], the metric reduction ansatz is

11 = e2/3 ds2

x1

4 + g2e1/3 xi

i . the four quantities i satisfypi 2

where e =p4

i = 1. the four scalars xi, which
2~ai  ~),
satisfy x1x2x3x4 = 1, are parameterised by the three dilatons ~, as xi = exp( 1
for certain constant 3-vectors ~ai. setting two of the dilatons to zero leads to x1 = x2  x,
x3 = x4 = 1/x. at the same time, the u (1) gauge elds are set pairwise equal, with

if we temporarily set x = 1 and a(1) = ea(1) = 0 (i.e. turning o the four-dimensional

eld excitations) , we see that the internal seven-dimensional metric in (44) becomes the

round 7-sphere, written as

a.2 ansatz with non-vanishing axion

in the above, we considered the situation when the axion of the n = 4 theory is set to

zero. when the axion is non-zero, we cannot deduce the form of the metric ansatz from the

previous results in [12]. now, we can make use of the general formalism in [10], where the

reduction ansatz for the n = 8 theory was obtained. in particular, the full metric ansatz

in [10] is relatively simple, and by truncating it appropriately we are able to construct the

ansatz for the n = 4 theory.

to begin, we need to determine the tensors uij

ij (x) and vijij (x) that appear in the

denition of the scalar 56-bein v and its inverse,

(52)

2 = d2 + e2 d2. note
(this is the mapping from the metric ds2
that in terms of  and , the scalar potential (26) is simply given by v = 4g2 (cosh + 2).)
it is shown in [9, 10] that the ansatz for the inverse metric in the internal space (the

2 = d2 + sinh2  d2 to ds2

7-sphere) is

(x, y) gmn(x, y) = 1

where

(54)

here gmn(y) denotes the metric of the undistorted round 7-sphere, and k mij are the 28

killing vectors in this metric. substituting our expressions (51) into (53), we nd

 gmn(x, y) = xi,j

thus j

while ej 

ab and ej 

ab are self-dual in the 4 + 4 dimensional subspaces spanned by i = (a, a),
ab are anti-self-dual.

ab k m ab and the
ab k m ab each close on su (2), and that the two sets mutually

ab k m ab each close on su (2), and these commute with each other and the other two
su (2)s. in fact what we are seeing here are the sets of 3 + 3 killing vectors on each of
two 3-spheres: k m  and k m  are the left-translation and right-translation killing vectors

it is easy to see that the 3 killing vector combinations k m   j 
3 combinations k m   j 
commute. likewise, the 3 combinations ek m   ej 
ej 
of one 3-sphere, while ek m  and ek

ab k m ab and the 3 combinations ek

are the left-translation and right-translation killing

vectors of the other 3-sphere.

now, considering the rst s 3, the sum of the squares of the left-translation killing
vectors, k m  k n  is equal to the sum of the squares of the right-translation killing vectors,
k m  k n , each sum giving the bi-invariant inverse metric gmn

on the s 3. a similar remark

applies to the second s 3. also, the sum of the squares of all 28 killing vectors gives the

inverse metric on the round 7-sphere, so (55) becomes

 gmn(x, y) = gmn(y) + (x 2  1) gmn

that our factor  is related to the corresponding factor  of [9, 10] by  = 3/2, we
eventually arrive at our metric ansatz (1), after introducing the so(4) = su (2)  su (2)
gauge elds as described earlier. note that it reduces to (48) if we set the axion to zero.

(we have introduced the gauge coupling constant by means of appropriate rescalings.)

note that here a, a and a denote the vielbein components of the four-dimensional space-
time derivatives of these functions, so a = a , etc. similarly, ,  and  denote their
derivatives with respect to . useful identities are a +a+a = 0, and ++ = 2 cot 2.

some partial formulae for the 4-form ansatz are presented in [10], but it is dicult to

turn them into explicit expressions, and in any case not all components are presented. we

therefore determined the 4-form ansatz in section 2 by brute-force methods.

a.3 some su(2) lemmata

here, we collect together some useful properties of the su (2)-valued forms that arise in
the reduction ansatz. we dene hi  i  g ai
are sets of left-invariant 1-forms on the two 3-spheres, satisfying (3). the yang-mills eld

(1), where i and i

(1), and hi  i  g eai

strengths are dened by (19). from their bianchi identities, we see that we should dene

gauge-covariant exterior derivatives

di  di + g ijk aj

(1)  k ,

ed i  di + g ijk eaj

(1)  k ,

(62)

for any forms with an adjoint index of the untilded or tilded su (2). the bianchi identities
themselves are then d f i

(2) = 0.

we can now derive a number of lemmata. since every formula for the untilded su (2)

(2) = 0, ed ef i

has an identical companion formula for the tilded su (2), we shall just present the untilded

ones.

dhi =  1

2 ijk hj  kk  g f i

(2)  g ijk aj

(1)  hk .

(63)

this can be written more elegantly using the gauge-covariant exterior derivative dened in

(62):

dhi =  1

2 ijk hj  hk  g f i
(2) .

(64)

this is a convenient way to express the result, because the gauge-covariant exterior deriva-

tive respects the leibniz rule, just as the ordinary exterior derivative does. thus, for

example,

another result is

d(hi  f i

(2)) = dhi  f i

(2)  hi  df i

=  1

2 ijk hj  hk  f i

(2) = dhi  f i
(2)  f i
(2) .

(2)  g f i

(2)

d(hi  f i

(2)) =  1

2 ijk hj  hk  f i

(2)  g f i

(2)  f i

(2)  hi  df i
(2) .

it is also useful to derive that

d(ijk hj  hk) = 2ijk hj  dhk = 2g ijk hj  f k
(2) .

from this, we see, for example, that

d(ijk hi  hj  f k

d(ijk hi  hj  f k
we also have the result that with (3)  h1  h2  h3,

(2)) = 0 ,

(2)) = ijk hi  hj  df k
(2) .

d(3) =  1

2 g ijk hi  hj  f k
(2) .
