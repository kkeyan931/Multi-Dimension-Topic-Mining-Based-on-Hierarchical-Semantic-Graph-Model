abstract

correlators of wilson loop operators with o4 = tr(f 2

 + ) are computed in
n = 4 super-yang-mills theory using the ads/cft correspondence. the results
are compared with the leading order perturbative computations. as a consequence of
conformal invariance, these correlators have identical forms in the weak and strong cou-
pling limits for circular loops. they are essentially dierent for contours not protected
by conformal symmetry.

the conjectured duality of n = 4, d = 4 super-yang-mills theory (sym) to supergrav-
ity on ads5  s5 gives rise to the possibility of obtaining quantitative information about
the former theory in the limit of innite t hooft coupling [1, 2, 3, 4]. though this is a
regime which is inaccessible to conventional perturbative eld theory methods, some of the
results obtained from the ads/cft correspondence can be tested by non-renormalization
theorems which protect certain correlation functions from gaining radiative corrections [4].
the quantities not protected by supersymmetry probe the genuine strong-coupling dynam-
ics of the sym theory. an example of such a quantity is the interaction potential between
static charges. the coulomb form of the potential is dictated by the conformal invariance of
n = 4 sym, but the strength of the interaction is not xed by any symmetry and appears
to be proportional to g2n at strong coupling [16, 17] in contrast to the weak-coupling
o(g2n) behavior.

the purpose of the present paper is to study the structure of the electric eld induced
by static charges in the vacuum. the static charges are introduced by a wilson loop. the
one appropriate for supergravity calculations corresponds to the phase factor acquired by an
innitely heavy w-boson propagating in background gauge and scalar elds [16, 18]:

w (c) =

1
n

tr p expic

d (ia x + i yi),

(1)

where the a are u(n) gauge elds and the i are scalars in the adjoint representation,
yi =  x2i where i is a point on the
both represented by hermitian matrices. moreover,
ve-dimensional sphere: 2 = 1.

the form of the coupling to scalars in (1) is natural from several points of view [18, 19].
in particular, this wilson loop operator is annihilated by half of the supercharges if c is a
straight line [18]. on the other hand, closed wilson loops are generally not supersymmetric.
a circular loop, however, is a special case since it can be mapped to a straight line by a
conformal transformation. the straight line wilson loop operator commutes with half of
the supersymmetry generators. thus, circular loops are annihilated by a combination of
supercharges twisted by conformal transformations:

q = (c)q(c),

(2)

where (c) is an unitary operator implementing a conformal transformation that maps c
to a line. since conformal invariance is an exact symmetry of the n = 4 sym vacuum,
|0i = |0i and the twisted supercharges annihilate the vacuum: q|0i = 0, along with
if the wilson loop has a dierent geometry,
the original supersymmetry generators q.
various non-renormalization theorems for n = 4 sym are discussed in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
in discussing supersymmetry, it is convenient to consider n = 4 sym theory as a reduction of ten-
dimensional n = 1 theory. then the supercharges are the components of a ten-dimensional majorana-weyl
spinor q. the gauge potentials and the scalar elds form a ten-dimensional vector: am = (a, i). the
supercharges act on gauge potentials as [q, am ] = i
2 (m ), where m are dirac matrices and  is
the ten-dimensional majorana-weyl fermion, the reduction of which to four dimensions gives the fermionic
content of n = 4 sym theory. the supersymmetry transformation of a wilson loop produces degenerate
combination of the dirac matrices [18]:  x m m , x m = (x, iyi), since x 2 = 0. an appropriate choice of
 turns the variation of a wilson loop to zero if

x m is constant, that is, if c is a straight line.

generically there is no residual supersymmetry. this is the case for a loop consisting of two
innite anti-parallel lines; this loop corresponds to a static electric dipole.

the structure of electric eld induced by the charges can be probed by local gauge

invariant operators, like tr f 2

. on the supergravity side,

couples to the dilaton. we consider the correlator of the wilson loop with o4(x):

o4(x) =

1

2g2 trnf 2

 + [i, j]2 + i[i, ]o

w(c, x) =  hw (c)

1

2g2 tr(f 2

(x) +   )iconn

,

hw (c)i

where the dots denote the scalar and the fermionic terms required to put the operator in the
short multiplet of n = 4 susy. the correlator (4) probes the local electric eld induced
by non-dynamical charges whose trajectories form the loop c. this correlator has been
discussed in the context of the ads/cft correspondence in the limiting case when the
distance from the point x to the loop c is large and the wilson loop can be expanded in
local operators [20]. the correlator (4) was also used to demonstrate that, in the nite-
temperature, conning phase of strongly coupled n = 4 sym, the classical string in the
bulk is projected onto an electric ux tube, stretched between static charges, which has
thickness on the order of the correlation length [21]. in the conformal theory, the correlator
must fall-o as a power of the distance from the loop. at weak coupling, the correlator
decreases with distance as 1/d6, since the the classical electric eld of the dipole falls o as
1/d3. we shall show that the correlator obeys a dierent power law at strong coupling.

at strong coupling, correlators in the sym theory are described by classical supergravity
on ads5  s5. we choose units in which the radius of ads5 is unity. the metric on
ads5  s5 in these units is

the wilson loop on the boundary of ads5 at z = 0 creates the classical string in the bulk;
it is the surface of minimal area bounded by the loop [16, 17]. the correlation function
(4) is given by the dilaton propagator with one end attached to the point x and the other
integrated over the minimal surface spanning the loop c [20]:

wg  qg2n z d2 det g

z 4

[z 2 + | ~x  ~x|2]4 ,

where gab = gm n ay m by n is the metric induced on the minimal surface. the surface is

parameterized by coordinates y m = (cid:16)z(), x ()(cid:17) in ads5.

at weak coupling, the correlator (4) is given by the lowest-order feynman diagram:

we start with the supersymmetry preserving circular loop. at weak coupling, we nd:

wg0 =

g2n
42

r4

[(y2 + r2  r2)2 + 4r2y2]2 ,

(8)

where r is the radius of the loop, r is the radial coordinate of the point x, and y is the
distance from x to the plane of the loop. this expression coincides with the result of the
strong-coupling supergravity calculation given in [20]:

wg  qg2n

r4

[(y2 + r2  r2)2 + 4r2y2]2 .

(9)

the functional form of the correlator of tr(f 2 +   ) with the circular loop appears not to
be renormalized. actually, this non-renormalization property is a consequence of conformal
symmetry. although the scale invariance only xes the above correlator up to a function of
two dimensionless ratios of the parameters r, r and y, the conformal transformation which
maps the circle to the line reduces the number parameters to one, the distance d between
the point and the line. the correlator of tr(f 2
 +   ) with the wilson line is determined
by the dimension of the dilaton operator and is proportional 1/d4. transforming the line to
the circle we get (8) with an overall coecient which can depend only on the coupling. the
distinguished role of the supersymmetry preserving circular loops is reected in the fact that
minimal surface in ads5 bounded by it has a very simple form [18, 20]. the minimal surfaces
bounded by contours which do not have such nice conformal properties are generically more
complicated [16, 17, 23, 18]. we will nd that for such contours the electric eld prole
probed by the correlator (4) is renormalized in a non-trivial way.

we consider the loop composed of antiparallel innite lines. the leading-order perturba-

tive result for the correlator with the dilaton operator in this case is

wg0 =

where l is the distance between the lines; d is the distance, in the plane of the lines, between
the point x and the line midway between the two lines; and y is the distance between x and
the plane of the lines: l = (0, l, 0, 0), x = (0, d, y, 0).

figure 1: wg (the shorter peak) and wg0 (the taller peak), drawn as a function of y
with l = 1 and d = 0. the heights are normalized so that the area under each curve is equal
to unity. note that asymptotically the wg fallo is actually faster (y7 versus y6).

(13)

where y, l, and d are as before.

this result is clearly dierent than that of the perturbative calculation. in particular,
we can consider the asymptotic behavior of each result when the distance to the point x is
much larger than the separation between the charges l. expanding (13) in l gives

g2n l3
(y2 + d2)7/2 + o(l5).

wg 

(14)

the perturbative correlator (10) is just the eld strength of electric dipole squared and is
proportional to l2 for small l:

wg0 =

g2n
642

(4d2 + y2)l2
(y2 + d2)4 + o(l4).

(15)

thus, the two correlators obey dierent power laws at large d, with wg falling o as d7
and wg0 falling o as d6. figure 1 shows the form of the correlator (4), as a function of
y, at strong and weak coupling, for d = 0.
however, the leading singularity as the point x approaches the loop obeys the same power
law in the weak and the strong coupling limits. in both cases, the correlator behaves as 4,
where  = d l/2 is the distance from the loop, as can be checked from (10) and (13). this
is to be expected as the dimension of the dilaton operator is not renormalized.
to conclude, we have calculated correlators of wilson loops with the dimension four chiral
operator tr(f 2 +   ) in n = 4 sym. we have compared the perturbative expression with

5

the strong coupling result predicted by the ads/cft correspondence. the correlator for a
circular loop has the same functional form in both regimes, whereas the answer is completely
dierent for antiparallel wilson lines. even the asymptotic form of the correlator at innity
appears to be modied.

finally, we observe that the coupling constant dependence of w(c, x) at large n is
natural and is related to the strong coupling limit of the wilson loop expectation value.
indeed, o4 is related to the action density of super-yang-mills theory if we add terms which
are a total divergence, and use the equations of motion for the scalar and fermion elds.
thus, the integral of (4) over the coordinate point x is related to the derivative of the
expectation value of the wilson loop by the coupling constant,

z d4xw(c, x) = g2 

g2 ln w (c)

(16)

also, we see from (6) that, in the g   limit, this integral of w(c, x) is equal to 2/6
times the minimal area of the surface. thus, if the wilson loop correlator at strong coupling
is ln w (c) = q4g2

y m n then we would expect that w(c, x) = 3q4g2
