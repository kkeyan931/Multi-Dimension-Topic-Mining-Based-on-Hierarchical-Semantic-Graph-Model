abstract

we propose a gauge invariant formulation of the exact renormalization group
equation for nonsupersymmetric pure u(n) yang-mills theory, based on the
construction by tim morris. in fact we show that our renormalization group
equation amounts to a regularized version of the loop equation, thereby pro-
viding a direct relation between the exact renormalization group and the
schwinger-dyson equations. we also discuss a possible implication of our
formulation to the holographic correspondence of the bulk gravity and the
boundary gauge theory.

1 introduction

the discovery of certain limits in string theory and m-theory can probably provide a

reasoning for the dualities between quantum gravity and gauge theory. the celebrated

examples are the light like limit [1] of m-theory, which at least literally justies the matrix

conjecture [2], and the near horizon limits [3, 4] of d-branes and m-branes [5] that led

us to recent excitement of the ads/cft duality [3, 6, 7]. both the matrix conjecture

and the ads/cft duality intimately originates from the old s-t channel duality in open

string loop amplitudes. it is, however, quite noteworthy that the discovery of the limits

of [1, 3, 4] elaborated and complemented our intuitive but naive anticipation of a dual

description of quantum gravity by a certain gauge theory, which may be based on the

above-mentioned duality of open and closed strings.

the ir/uv relation, pointed out in [8, 9], itself is not surprising from the viewpoint of

the s-t channel duality. but a rather conceptual payo of this relation in the near horizon

limit seems quite remarkable. in particular the identication of the radial coordinate u

in the near horizon geometry with the energy or the cuto scale  of the gauge theory

claries the holographic nature of the ads/cft duality, in which it is quite plausibly

assumed that the gauge theory contains only one degree of freedom per cell of the cuto
size.2 this postulate and the resultant holographic property actually t in the basic idea
of the wilsonian renormalization group (wilsonian rg) [10].3 the assumption concerning
degrees of freedom of the gauge theory is almost assured, if one refers to, for example, a

lattice regularization. once we regard the cuto  of the boundary gauge theory as the

radial dimension in the bulk space, degrees of freedom of the bulk gravity may well be

constituted solely from those of the boundary gauge theory, and the coarsening procedure

or the rg transformation gives the dynamics in the interior space, which will likely be in

general more complicated than that on the boundary. thus we hope in this respect that

the rg ow may correspond to the holographic mapping of the boundary data.

the motivation of this paper is to invent a formulation, on the gauge theory side, that

might be a useful setting for discussing this hope. since in the ads/cft duality gravi-

tational modes in the bulk correspond to the gauge invariant operators on the boundary

gauge theory, a gauge invariant formulation, in which the gauge redundancy is eliminated,

2there is in fact a subtlety in the relation between the radial coordinate u and the cuto scale  [9].
the existence of two distinct relations is emphasized there. in both cases, however, there is a universal
property that the cuto scale  increases with the radial scale u up to dimensions 5 of the boundary
gauge theory.

3the scale invariant theories, of course, do not have a nontrivial rg ow. we would, however, like
to emphasize this point, suppose that the argument in [8] can be applied to more general nonconformal
cases.

may be much suited for discussing this sort of duality. in this regard we would like to

respect a technique of collective eld theory developed in [11], and apply it to a gauge

invariant formulation of the exact rg equation.

there exist several papers [12], in which the authors discussed the rg interpretation

of the ads/cft duality and some of them suggested the equivalence of the equation of
motion in the ads space (and its slight generalization) with the rg equation.4 we hope
that our formulation adds a new perspective along the line of their arguments.

2 a gauge invariant formulation of the exact rg

equation

recently tim morris [14] proposed an exact rg equation for the yang-mills theory in a

manifestly gauge invariant way, by constructing it in terms of a gauge invariant variable,

wilson loop, just like the philosophy of the collective eld method [11]. his formulation is

based on an observation inspired from a simple derivation [15] of the exact rg, that the

exact rg equation is related to a particular eld redenition of the theory. for example,

in scalar eld theories in d dimensions, the exact rg equation may be written in a form,




es =z ddx



(x)(cid:16) [(x)] es(cid:17) ,

(1)

where  [(x)] is induced from an innitesimal change of the scalar eld, (x)  (x) +

 [(x)]. the exact rg equation [15], which was employed to prove the renormaliz-
ability of the 4 theory in four dimensions, is obtained by choosing the eld redenition
as

 [(x)] =

1

2z ddy" g(x  y)

s

(y)

 2(cid:16) g  g1

 (cid:17) (x  y)(y)# ,

(2)

(3)

where g(x  y) is the cuto propagator of a massless scalar, dened by

g(x  y) =z ddp

1

p2 eip(xy)k(p2/2),

in which k(p2/2) is a cuto function that will take the value 1 for p2 < 2 and vanish
rapidly at innity. also g is the derivative of the propagator with respect to the cuto
, i.e.,

g = 

 g.

in pure yang-mills theory in d dimensions we may write the exact rg equation as




es = trz ddx



a(x)(cid:16) [a(x)] es(cid:17) .

(4)

4s.-j. rey also bears an idea to develop this line of arguments [13].

2

here we introduced a standard convention, a(x) = t aa

a (x).
a straightforward adaptation of the above regularization scheme (2), however, spoils the

a(x) = t a

a(x) and


a



gauge symmetry. one way to avoid it is to look for some other form of the eld redenition

(2) which maintains the gauge invariance. indeed one such a choice was found in [14], in

which a trick, the introduction of a pair of wilson lines into the eld redenition, seemed

to play an essential role. we make use of this trick, but we propose somehow a similar but

dierent formulation of the gauge invariant exact rg equation. in fact our formulation

can be directly connected with the loop equation [16], as is rather dierent from the one

proposed in [14].

our choice of the eld redenition is

[a(x)] =

(5)

this corresponds to the fourier expansion of eq.(2). here [xy] is an advertised wilson

, where the contour xy is a line from
line, and dened by [xy] = p e
x to y. also k (x) denotes the derivative of k(x), i.e., k (x) = d
dx k(x), and gb is the
bare yang-mills coupling. in this form it is not clear whether the exact rg equation (4)

is gauge invariant. we will, however, see below that it is indeed the case.

now we can formally integrate the rg equation (4), and it takes the form

as explained in the appendix, a loop cm denotes the merging of two loops c and c , and
is given by a product of four line contours as cm = cx(s)x(s)x(s)x(s)cx(s)x(s)x(s)x(s).
also a pair of loops cb and c b is broken up from a loop c, and they are expressed as
cb = x(s)x(s)cx(s)x(s) and c b = cx(s)x(s)x(s)x(s). here we distinguished a pair of
lines xy introduced in the eld redenition (5) from the other lines cxy which are parts
of loops c and c .

we will discuss later a possible implication of this result in the holographic correspon-

dence of the bulk gravity and the boundary gauge theory.

5in the standard formulation of the exact rg, the source j for a local operator is chosen in such a
way that j(p) is vanishing for higher momentum p2 > 2 [15]. but the source j(c) introduced here is
the one for a non-local operator, and so it is unclear what choice is appropriate for the exact rg. we will
not make any restrictions on the source at this stage, instead it will be constrained by the consistency of
the exact rg equation, as we will see in the next section.

4

3 loop equation from the exact rg equation

the schwinger-dyson equation is supposed to contain as much information as the exact

rg equation, in a sense that, if we were to solve either of these two equations nonpertur-

batively, we could in principle obtain all the physical information of the quantum eld the-

ory. thus we will be expected to have an intrinsic way to translate the schwinger-dyson

equation into the exact rg equation, and vice versa, implicitly or explicitly. actually we

need to check if our proposed formulation really works, by, say, rederiving a known result

obtained from a reliable formulation.

in this respect it turns out interestingly enough

that our exact rg equation amounts to a regularized version of the loop equation of [16],

while this result is not so surprising and in fact rather reasonable, as we just mentioned.

to see it, let us note that eq.(9) can be further rewritten into the form

where zb[j] is the generating functional of the bare form, i.e.,

z[j] = eeh[ 

j ,j;]zb[j],

zb[j] =z da exp sb +xc

j(c)w (c)!.

(11)

(12)

also in the operator fh[ 

sources js.

j s are ordered on the right side of the

therefore we may recognize that the quantity in the square bracket is vanishing, and then

integrating over the momentum p, we come up to the loop equation with a regularization,

note that interestingly the cuto function k(p2/2) enters in an expected way. in fact

r ddpk(p2/2)eip(x(s)x(s)) can be thought of as a smeared -function, which is neces-

sary to regularize the loop equation. also loops are ordinarily closed by this -function,

and so the smearing of the -function might undergo a potential breakdown of the gauge

symmetry. it is, however, obvious from our explicit computation that loops are closed in

spite of the smearing of the -function in our formulation, due to a pair of wilson lines

introduced in the eld redenition (5).

4 discussion

as emphasized in the introduction, the cuto scale  of the gauge theory can be regarded

as the radial scale u in the ads space, or more generally in the near horizon geometries
of dp-branes [9].6 this simple but signicant observation led us to contemplate the rg
interpretation of the bulk/boundary duality, and pursue a gauge invariant formulation of

the exact rg equation for the yang-mills theory. in particular to discuss the ads/cft

duality, we apparently need to consider the supersymmetric extension of our formulation.

for this purpose the analysis in [18, 19] and a supersymmetric wilson loop in [20] are

certainly of importance. we would, however, like to discuss a possibility implied by our

formulation in rather wider context of the holographic correspondence between the bulk

gravity and the boundary gauge theory.

according to the wisdom of the ads/cft duality, a disturbance on the boundary will

be responded by the bulk gravity as a gravitational uctuation, in such a way that

(cid:28)exp(cid:18)zm

ddx0(x)o(x)(cid:19)(cid:29) = exp(cid:16)sgrav[(x, u)](cid:17) ,

(16)

where m is the boundary of the bulk space m, and o(x) is a local operator on the

boundary eld theory. also (x, u) is a gravitational mode on the bulk space, and it
becomes 0(x) at the boundary. furthermore in the gravity action sgrav the gravitational
mode (x, u) is subject to the equation of motion, so that the r.h.s. depends only on the

boundary value (x, ) = 0(x) of a gravitational mode.

6again we should be careful with the distinction between holographic and d-brane probes. see a

footnote in the introduction.

6

if we insist on a stronger conjecture [3] on this duality that the string theory in the

bulk is dual to the nite n boundary gauge theory, we may consider the correlation

functions of wilson loops w (c) instead of local operators o(x). then the gravity action

might be replaced by the string eld action. from this viewpoint we would like to recall

our result (11) on the generating functional of wilson loop correlators,

*exp xc

j(c)w (c)!+ = z[j] = exp fh[

, j; ]! zb[j].


j

(17)

now let us put the rg interpretation of the bulk/boundary duality into this argument.

the bulk physics at some scale u may be given by the boundary gauge theory in which

degrees of freedom at higher momentum modes than the cuto scale  are integrated

out.

operator fh[ 
sense we would like to regard the rg ow operator fh[ 

in this regard zb[j] denotes the unintegrated form of the generating functional,
and so it corresponds to the bulk physics at the ir limit or the boundary. then the
j , j; ] gives the rg ow from uv to ir of the boundary gauge theory, that
corresponds to a mapping from the boundary to the interior of the bulk gravity. in this
j , j; ] as the holographic mapping
of the boundary data. moreover as we discussed in the last section, the rg equation
implies d
d z[j] = 0, which is tantamount to a regularized version of the loop equation.
thus we might interpret the regularized loop equation as the string eld equation of
j , j; ] has a
form of the string eld hamiltonian which consists of the terms that describe the joining

motion in the bulk space. remember also that the rg ow operator fh[ 

and the splitting of strings and the string propagation. these facts t at least literally in

a stronger conjecture on the bulk/boundary duality.

apart from the rg interpretation of the bulk/boundary duality, we would like to

mention a similarity of our formulation with the stochastic quantization of the yang-

mills theory. in fact the authors in [21] proposed an interpretation of the fokker-planck

hamiltonian of the yang-mills theory as the string eld hamiltonian, initially as the one in

the temporal gauge, just as discussed in the non-critical string theory, and later speculated

an alternative interpretation that the ctitious time  of the stochastic quantization can
be thought of as the radial coordinate u of the ads space.7 our formulation is close to
their latter speculation. this similarity originates from the fact that the exact rg and

the fokker-planck equations are quite similar diusion equations with the cuto  and

7actually the string eld theory in the temporal gauge of non-critical strings was rst proposed in
[22], and subsequently it was reconstructed in [23] as a collective eld theory of stochastic quantization of
matrix models in the double scaling limit. also the intrinsic equivalence of the fokker-planck hamiltonian
and the loop operator was pointed out in [24]. the authors in [21] patched those ideas together, and added
a new interpretation in the context of the polyakovs non-critical strings [25] and also of the ads/cft
duality.

meaning to the nite value of the ctitious time  in the stochastic quantization .
