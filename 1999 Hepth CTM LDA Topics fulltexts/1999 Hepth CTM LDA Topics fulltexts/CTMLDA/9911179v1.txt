abstract

we calculate the casimir force between two parallel plates if the bound-
ary conditions for the photons are modied due to presence of the chern-
simons term. we show that this eect should be measurable within the
present experimental technique.

1 introduction

the chern-simons gauge theories [1, 2] attract much attention due to both their
theoretical beauty and practical applications to certain condensed matter phe-
nomena. most notable is the generation of states with fractional statistics rst
observed by wilczek [3]. later this phenomenon was used to describe composite
fermions [4] in the theory of the fractional quantum hall eect (fqhe) (see, e.g.,
[5]).

the casimir eect (see, e.g., the book [6]) is a nowadays also experimen-
tally well established [7, 8] macroscopic quantum eect. several applications are
known, ranging from the bag model in qcd [9] to constraints on hypothetical
long range interactions [10].

in the present paper we investigate another situation where the casimir eect
eventually may serve as a test for certain theoretical models in solid state theory,
namely for models including a chern-simons term. we consider the situation
when the maxwell volume action (which is in (3+1) dimensions) is supplemented
by a chern-simons surface term. we argue that such boundary term naturally
leads to a modication of ordinary conductor and bag boundary conditions. such
a modication can also be considered on its own right as the only possible one

with a local gauge invariant p -odd term without any new dimensional coupling.
the boundary condition and quantization are discussed in the next section.

in section 3 we calculate the ground state energy for the system of two parallel
planes bearing dierent chern-simons charges. we show that the casimir force
depends substantially on these charges and can even change sign under certain
conditions. given recent advances in the casimir force experiments [8], the eect
could be measurable. theoretical and phenomenological implications of our work
are discussed in the last section.

2 chern-simons boundary conditions for ordi-

nary and dual potentials

consider a region m in the space-time with a boundary m. let the maxwell
action on m be supplemented by the chern-simons surface action:

s =

d4x g

2 ff  

a

2 zm

d3x ijkaijak,

(1)

where ijk is the levi-civita tensor and the xj are coordinates on the boundary
m, a being a real parameter. after integration by parts one gets

s =

2 zm
2 zm

1

d3x(h

1

2 (n ai  ian )ai + aijkaijak),

(2)

where 2 is the dalambertian, n is the outward pointing normal vector, and h
is the determinant of the induced metric on m. the volume term in (2) (with
a suitable gauge choice) generates the wave equation for a, the surface term
generates the boundary conditions.

there are two sets of local gauge-invariant boundary conditions which ensure
the vanishing of the surface term in (2). the rst one is called relative boundary
conditions

ai|m = 0,

(n + k)an |m = 0.

(3)

here k is the trace of the second fundamental form of the boundary. the second
set reads [11]:

an |m = 0,

(n ai + ai

jkjak)|m = 0 i = 0, 1, 2, .

(4)

note that variation of the surface term in (2) with respect to ai gives precisely
the sum of the two conditions (4).

let us suppose for simplicity that the boundary m consists of two parallel
innite plates located at x3 = const. in this case k = 0. consider the right plate,

2

xn = x3. the boundary conditions (3) and (4) can be rewritten in terms of the
eld strengths giving respectively

h3|m = 0,
(e3 + ah3)|m = 0,

ek|m = 0;

(hk  aek)|m = 0

(5)
(6)

when the coupling to charged particles is absent (as in the problem of the
casimir energy calculations) one can quantize the photons in terms of the dual
potentials a
:

f  =

1
2

f,

f = a

  a



(7)

in the case of the electromagnetic eld in a dielectric the quantization in terms of
a even gives some technical advantages [12]. one can also consider the chern-
simons term with the ordinary vector potential a replaced by the dual potential
a
. the corresponding boundary conditions will be dual to the two sets (5) and
(6):

e3|m = 0,
(h3  ae3)|m = 0,

hk|m = 0;

(ek + ahk)|m = 0

(8)
(9)

the conditions (5) correspond a conducting boundary. their duals (8) are
called bag boundary conditions. the conditions (6) and (9) generalize (8) and
(5) respectively for the case of non-zero chern-simons coupling. the two sets (6)
and (9) are related by a  1/a. therefore, it is enough to consider just one set
(6). dierent connected pieces of the boundary can correspond to dierent values
of a. equal values of a everywhere will correspond to complete dual invariance.
at this point we must note that there is no exact equivalence between bound-
ary conditions and a boundary action. here we are considering a mixed problem
when the a = 0 physics is described by rigid boundary conditions which are later
modied by the presence of the chern-simons boundary term. a more rigorous
way would be to describe the full interaction of photons with the boundary by a
boundary action and treat it as a -function potential (for the mathematical set-
up see e.g. [13]). this would lead however to considerable technical complexities.
we believe that our present approach gives correct (zeroth order) approximation
to the real physics.

a suitable gauge choice is

jaj = 0 .

(10)

the boundary conditions (4) are invariant under the gauge transformations a

tors for the ghosts and for the a3 does not depend on the chern-simons coupling
a. moreover, in the gauge (10) they does not contain 3 and, hence, does not
contribute to the casimir force. therefore, in the following we will be interested
in the two polarizations of the eld ai satisfying (10).

note that n |x3=l = n |x3=0 = 3. the sign before the levi-civita tensor
should be also dierent on the two components of the boundary due to the re-
versed orientation. consider the b+ polarization for deniteness. the boundary
condition at x3 = 0 is solved by the following harmonics:

b+(x3) = a(0) sin k3x3 + cos k3x3 .

substituting (15) in the boundary condition at x3 = l one gets

(a(l)  a(0)) cos k3l  (1 + a(l)a(0)) sin k3l = 0 ,

(15)

(16)

whose solutions are k3 = n. it is useful to rewrite condition (16) in the form
f (k3) = 0 with

f (k) = sin(kl + )

(17)

where  = arctan(cid:0)(a(0)  a(l))/(1 + a(l)a(0))(cid:1). obviously, when  = 0 (a(0) =
a(l)) the chern-simons surfaces interact with the same potential as two dirichlet
planes. in the case  = 
2 interaction coincides with that of a dirichlet with a
newmann plane.

to proceed with the calculation of the ground state energy we rst integrate

in (13) over the momenta ka and obtain

(18)

(19)

now we proceed in the usual way by changing from the discrete sum to an integral.
following, e.g., the paper [14] we obtain

cs(s) = z

k32s 
k

ln f (k) ,

(20)

where the integration path  encircles the zeros of the function f (k). having
in mind that  = 0 corresponds to the well known case of dirichlet boundary
conditions on both planes we represent the ground state energy in the form

e0 = 

1

1440

h() ,

(21)

where the function h() describes the relative deviation of the casimir energy for
the chern-simons boundary conditions from that for two dirichlet planes. from
(18) and (20) we obtain

h() =

120
2 (s  0)

(22)

where s  0 means the analytic continuation and we can put l = 1 in .

in order to calculate the function h() we divide the integration path  in
(20) into an upper part 1 (with k > 0) and an lower part 2. on the upper
part we represent


k

ln sin(k + ) =



k (cid:0)i(k + ) + ln(cid:0)1  e2i(k+)(cid:1)(cid:1)

and on the lower part we choose


k

ln sin(k + ) =



k (cid:0)i(k + ) + ln(cid:0)e2i(k+)  1(cid:1)(cid:1) ,

(23)

(24)

which is just the complex conjugate of (23). the rst contributions on the r.h.s.
of (23) and (24) do not depend on the chern-simons parameter a and represent

(divergent) energy density in the empty minkowski space. we drop them there-
fore. than we turn the integration contours, namely k  ik on 1 and k  ik
on 2. after that we can take the limit s  0 because of the now exponential
convergence of the integral and obtain

we note the special values h(0) = 1 which conrms the case of dirichlet boundary
conditions on both planes and

(27)

where the last number reproduces the repulsive potential between dirichlet and
neumann planes. this function can be easily plotted, the result is shown in
figure 1. to obtain the complete interaction energy one should also take into
account the contribution of the second polarization b which results in an overall
factor of 2 in the ground state energy (18). obviously, this means that the full
interaction energy of the chern-simons surfaces is obtained from the interaction
energy of two conducting planes by multiplication by the same function h().

4 conclusions

action arm

in this paper we have argued that the presence of the chern-simons bound-
ary action naturally leads to a modication of the boundary conditions for the
photons. more precisely, we show that one of the admissible sets of the bound-
ary conditions, namely bag or conductor ones, receives a contribution from
the chern-simons interaction (depending on which potentials, ordinary or dual,
are used in the chern-simons term). usually, the type of the potential does not
matter because the chern-simons term originates from the dual invariant volume
f f. this case corresponds to equal chern-simons couplings on
both surfaces and does not lead to modication of the ground state energy. in the
present context the case of the broken duality (a(0) 6= a(l)) is more interesting,
but less clear as far as a modication of the boundary conditions is concerned.
to clarify this point one should consider the microscopic interaction of photons
with the surface which is out of the scope of the present paper (see also a remark
before the eq. (10)). in any case, we nd it quite unnatural if the presence of
a specic p -odd surface interaction will have no eect on the boundary condi-
tions at all. the simplest relevant modication of the boundary conditions (local,

gauge invariant, without new dimensional parameters) is just the one considered
in the present paper.

for a given set of the chern-simons boundary conditions we have calculated
rigorously the ground state energy for two parallel planes bearing dierent chern-
simons charges. as can be seen from the g. 1, the casimir force exhibits a strong
dependence on the chern-simons coupling and can even change its sign as com-
pared to the case of two conducting planes. with the present experimental tech-
nique [7] maintaining a precision of about 1% even correspondingly small values of
the chern-simons parameter a should be measurable in an experiment with one
conducting plane and another one presumably bearing the chern-simons interac-
tion. such a measurement would provide an important check for the theoretical
models including p -odd interaction of electromagnetic eld with a surface.

the most spectacular application would be the (fqhe). an exact relation
between the mechanism of the fractional conductivity and the boundary condi-
tions is not well established yet. as well, it is not clear which part of the virtual
photons responsible for the casimir force would see the fqhe. however, if
any interaction exists and if it makes sense to idealize it by boundary conditions
than it should be of the type considered here. hence, the casimir force between
two surfaces might serve as a tool to study these eects. even though an actual
experimental realization of such a measurement is not going to be simple, it could
result in independent and interesting results.
