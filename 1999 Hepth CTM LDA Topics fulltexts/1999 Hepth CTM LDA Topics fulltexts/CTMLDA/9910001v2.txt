we advocate a set of approximations for studying the nite temperature be-
havior of strongly-coupled theories in 0+1 dimensions. the approximation
consists of expanding about a gaussian action, with the width of the gaus-
sian determined by a set of gap equations. the approximation can be applied
to supersymmetric systems, provided that the gap equations are formulated
in superspace.
it can be applied to large-n theories, by keeping just the
planar contribution to the gap equations.

we analyze several models of scalar supersymmetric quantum mechanics,
and show that the gaussian approximation correctly distinguishes between
a moduli space, mass gap, and supersymmetry breaking at strong coupling.
then we apply the approximation to a bosonic large-n gauge theory, and
argue that a gross-witten transition separates the weak-coupling and strong-
coupling regimes. a similar transition should occur in a generic large-n
gauge theory, in particular in 0-brane quantum mechanics.

1 introduction

recent developments have made it clear that at a non-perturbative level
string or m-theory often has a dual description in terms of large-n gauge
theory [1, 2]. this has many interesting implications, both for string theory
and for the behavior of large-n gauge theory. these developments have been
reviewed in [3].

a general property of these dualities is that semiclassical gravity can
be used only in regimes where the gauge theory is strongly coupled. for
certain terms in the eective action, which are protected by supersymmetry
[4], a weak coupling calculation in the gauge theory can be extrapolated to
strong coupling and compared to supergravity [5, 6, 7, 8]. but in general
non-perturbative methods must be used to analyze the gauge theory in the
supergravity regime. although this reects the power of duality, as providing
a solution to strongly coupled gauge theory, it is also a source of frustration.
for example, one would like to use the duality to understand black hole
dynamics in terms of gauge theory [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 22]. but progress along these lines has been hampered by our
inadequate understanding of gauge theory.

thus we would like to have direct control over the gauge theory at strong
coupling. such control is presumably easiest to achieve in a low-dimensional
setting. the specic system we have in mind is 0-brane quantum mechanics
[23], in the temperature regime where it is dual to a 10-dimensional non-
extremal black hole [24]. the dual supergravity makes denite predictions
for the partition function of this gauge theory. in the temperature regime
under consideration, the partition function is in principle given by the sum of
planar diagrams. although directly summing all planar diagrams seems like a
hopeless task, one might hope for a reasonable approximation scheme, which
can be used to resum a suciently large class of diagrams to see agreement
with supergravity.

in this paper we develop a set of approximations which, we hope, can
eventually be used to do this. essentially we self-consistently resum an in-
nite subset of the perturbation series. these methods have a long history in
many-body physics [25] and eld theory [26, 27], and have been used to study
qcd [28, 29], large-n gauge theory [30], and even supersymmetry breaking
[31]. the basic idea is to approximate the theory of interest with a gaussian
action. the gaussian action is (in general) non-local in time, with a variance
that is determined by solving a set of gap equations.1 one can systematically
compute corrections to this approximation, in an expansion about the gaus-

sian action. to study large-n theories in this formalism, one keeps only the
planar contribution to the gap equations. to study supersymmetric systems,
we will see that one needs to formulate the gap equations in superspace: loop
corrections to the auxiliary elds must be taken into account in order for the
approximation to respect supersymmetry.

an outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we illustrate the ap-
proximation in the simple context of 0 + 0 dimensional 4 theory, and discuss
various ways of formulating gap equations. we also discuss (but do not re-
solve) the diculties with implementing gauge symmetry in the gaussian
approximation. in section 3 we turn to a series of quantum mechanics prob-
lems with n = 2 supersymmetry but no gauge symmetry, and show that
the gaussian approximation captures the correct qualitative strong-coupling
behavior present in these simple systems.
in section 4 we discuss large-n
gauge theories in 0+1 dimensions, and argue that generically a gross-witten
transition is present, which separates the weak-coupling and strong-coupling
phases. in section 5 we apply the gaussian approximation to two large-n
quantum mechanics problems: a bosonic gauge theory, and a supersymmetric
matrix model with a moduli space. we discuss the relevance of these results
for 0-brane quantum mechanics.

2 formulating the gaussian approximation

2.1 a simple example: 4 theory in 0 + 0 dimensions

our approach to studying strongly-coupled low-dimensional systems can be
illustrated in the following simple context. consider 0 + 0 dimensional 4
theory, with action

s =

1

g2(cid:18) 1

2 +

1
4

2

4(cid:19) .

the partition function is given in terms of a bessel function, by

z = ebf =z 



d es =

1
2

e1/8g2

k1/4(cid:18) 1

8g2(cid:19) .

expanding this result for weak coupling one obtains an asymptotic series for
the free energy.

f = 

1
2

log(cid:0)2g2(cid:1) +

3
4

g2  3g4 +

99
4

g6 + o(g8)

(3)

this series can of course be reproduced by doing conventional perturbation
theory in the coupling g2.

2

but suppose we are interested in the behavior of the free energy at strong

coupling. from the exact expression we know that this is given by

f = 

1
2

log g  log



(3/4)

+ o(1/g) .

(4)

is there some approximation scheme that reproduces this result? clearly
working to any nite order in conventional perturbation theory is hopeless.
but it turns out that by resumming a subset of the perturbation series one
can do much better. to this end consider approximating the theory (1) with
the following gaussian theory.

z0 = ef0 =z 



s0 =

1
22 2

d es0

(5)

the width of the gaussian 2 is for the moment left arbitrary. by writing

z =z d es0e(ss0)

one obtains the identity

f = f0  < e(ss0)  1 >c,0

(6)

where the subscript c, 0 denotes a connected expectation value in the gaus-
sian theory (5). by expanding this identity in powers of s  s0 we obtain a
reorganized perturbation series2

f = f0+ < s  s0 >0 

1
2

< (s  s0)2 >c,0 +   .

the rst few terms are given by

the identity (6) holds for any choice of s0. but we wish to truncate the
series (7), and the truncated series depends on the value of 2. so we need a
2there is a real advantage to keeping at least the rst two terms in the reorganized
perturbation series: one is free to add a constant term to s0, which may depend on the
couplings or temperature but is independent of the elds. any such additive ambiguity
cancels between bf0 and < s  s0 >0.

the schwinger-dyson equation3

this is an exact relation among correlation functions in the full theory. it
seems reasonable to ask that the same relation hold in the gaussian theory,
that is, to require that < 1
g2 (2 + 4) >0= 1. this implies that 2 obeys the
gap equation

2 =

1
g2 +

32
g2 .

(8)

this equation has a simple diagrammatic interpretation, shown in fig. 1: it
self-consistently resums certain self-energy corrections to the  propagator.

at weak coupling the gap equation implies 2 = g2 + o(g4) and thus the

leading term in the gaussian approximation is

f0 = 

1
2

log 2g2 + o(g2) .

this matches the weak coupling behavior seen in (3). at weak coupling
the higher order terms in the reorganized perturbation series are small, sup-
pressed by increasing powers of the coupling.

of course it is not surprising that the gaussian approximation works
well at weak coupling, since at weak coupling the action (1) is approximately
gaussian. but what is rather remarkable is that the gaussian approximation
also gives good results at strong coupling, where the 4 term in s dominates.
at strong coupling the gap equation gives 2 = g
+ o(1) and thus the
3
leading term in the gaussian approximation is

f0 = 

1

log g

thus f0 has the same leading strong-coupling behavior as the exact result
(4). moreover, by reorganizing the perturbation series we have tamed the

indeed the rst few terms of the reorganized perturbation series fall o nicely
with the order. this provides an intrinsic reason to expect that truncating
the reorganized perturbation series at low orders should provide a good ap-
proximation to the exact result.4

2.2 varieties of gap equations

consider a set of degrees of freedom i, governed by an action s(i). we
wish to approximate this system with a simpler action s0(i). for the most
part we will take s0 to be gaussian in the fundamental elds.

s0 =xi

1
22
i

2
i

but in some situations, in particular for gauge theories, we will be led to use
a more general action, which is exactly soluble but not strictly gaussian, of
the form

s0 =xa

1
aoa .

here the a are adjustable parameters, and the oa are composite operators
built out of the fundamental elds.

in either case, the adjustable parameters appearing in s0 will be chosen
to satisfy a set of gap equations. there are several prescriptions for writing
down gap equations. all the gap equations given below have one feature in
common: they correspond to critical points of an eective action.5 we now
present several prescriptions for writing down gap equations.

 lowest-order schwinger-dyson gap equations
4although we havent investigated the issue, it seems too much to hope that the reor-

ganized perturbation series is actually convergent.

5for gap equations which follow from a variational principle, the gap equations give
a global minimum of the eective action. but in general the gap equations only give a
critical point.

5

for a generic degree of freedom i one has the schwinger-dyson equa-
tion

< i

s
i

>= 1

(9)

(no sum on i). this is an exact relation among correlation functions
in the full theory, which can be derived by the standard procedure
sketched in section 2.1.
it seems natural to choose the parameters
of s0 in such a way that the same relation holds between correlation
functions evaluated in s0. that is, a natural set of gap equations
corresponds to demanding that for each i

< i

s
i

>0= 1 .

(10)

this gap equation can be obtained from an eective action, as follows.
assuming that s0 is strictly gaussian, and writing s as a polynomial
in the fundamental elds, one can show that the gap equations (10) are
equivalent to requiring


2
i

(f0+ < s  s0 >0) = 0 .

(11)

that is, these gap equations make the rst two terms of the perturba-
tion series for f stationary with respect to variations of the 2
i .

 operator gap equations

it is natural to ask that expectation values of the operators oa agree
when calculated in s0 and in s:

< oa >=< oa >0 .

(12)

for example, when discussing gauge theories, we will introduce the

wilson loop operator o = trp eih a. then the condition (12) demands
that wilson loops agree when computed in s0 and in s. as another
example, suppose that s0 is gaussian, with oi = 2
i . then (12) means
choosing the gaussian widths 2
i to be the exact 2-point functions of
the full theory.

as it stands (12) is not a useful equation. but it can be rewritten as

< oae(ss0) >c,0=< oa >0

(13)

and expanded in powers of s  s0. at leading order this condition is
trivially satised. but at rst order we get the gap equation6

6it is tempting to try to improve this gap equation by expanding (13) to higher orders

< oa(s  s0) >c,0= 0 .

(14)

in s  s0. but this rarely seems to lead to useful gap equations.

6

to relate this to an eective action, note the identities

f0 = 

1
2
a

< oa >0


a

a

< oa(s  s0) >c,0 +
thus the gap equation (14) is equivalent to requiring

< s  s0 >0=

1
2
a

1
2
a

< oa >0 .


a

(f0+ < s  s0 >0) = 0 .

(15)

note that if s0 is strictly gaussian then these operator gap equations
reduce to (11).

 variational gap equations

in some cases gap equations can be obtained from a variational prin-
ciple. for purely bosonic theories one has a bound on the free energy,
that

f  f0+ < s  s0 >0 .

thus one can formulate a variational principle, based on minimizing
the right hand side of the inequality with respect to a [32]. note that
the resulting gap equations are equivalent to (15).

the gap equations that we have discussed so far are all essentially equiv-
alent: they follow from varying f0+ < s  s0 >0. unfortunately, they will
not be sucient to analyze many of the theories of interest in this paper. for
example, suppose that s0 is purely gaussian, and that s only has non-trivial
3-point couplings. such couplings do not contribute to f0+ < ss0 >0, so
the gap equations discussed above are not sensitive to the interactions. but
then, if some eld is massless at tree level, f0 will suer from an infrared
divergence.

to resolve these diculties, we turn to the

 one-loop gap equations

the gap equation of section 2.1 resummed an innite set of feynman
diagrams, involving one-loop self-energy corrections to the propagator.
this can be extended to theories with both 3-point and 4-point inter-
actions, as follows. write s = sii +siii +siv +   as a sum of 2-point,
3-point, 4-point, . . . couplings, and assume that s0 is strictly gaussian.
consider the quantity

ie = f0+ < sii  s0 >0 + < siv >0 

1
2

< (siii)2 >c,0 .

figure 2: one-loop gap equations. heavy lines are dressed propagators and
thin lines are bare propagators.

requiring 
ie = 0 gives a set of gap equations which resum all
2
i
one-loop self-energy corrections to the propagators, built from both
3-point and 4-point vertices. these gap equations are illustrated in
fig. 2. they are sucient to cure the infrared divergences for most
theories of interest. the quantity ie can be identied with the 2pi
eective action of cornwall, jackiw and tomboulis [27], as calculated
in a two-loop approximation.

in general it does not seem possible to give a prescription for choosing the
best set of gap equations. indeed it is not even clear what best means  it
may depend on what one wishes to calculate. for example, in some cases, the
variational principle gives the optimal gap equations to use when estimating
the free energy. a dierent set of gap equations will give a worse estimate
of the free energy, but may give a better estimate of other quantities, such
as 2-point correlations. the only general advice we can oer is that the
gap equations must be chosen to cure all the infrared divergences which are
present in the model. if possible, the gap equations should also respect all
the symmetries of the model.7

2.3 diculties with gauge symmetry

there is a serious diculty which one encounters when applying the gaussian
approximation to a gauge theory. the underlying gauge invariance implies
ward identities, which relate dierent greens functions. but the gaussian
approximation often violates these identities, and this can lead to inconsis-
tencies.

to illustrate the problem, consider an action s(i) which only has 3-point
and 4-point couplings  for example ordinary yang-mills theory. we assume
that the one-point functions < i > vanish. then the exact schwinger-dyson
equations < i
>= 1 can be rewritten in terms of proper (1pi) vertices
as shown in fig. 3 [28, 29, 33].

couplings but no tadpoles. the solid blobs are dressed propagators; the
empty circles are 1pi vertices. all external lines are amputated.

the one-loop gap equations which we discussed in the previous subsec-
tion are a truncation of this system. they correspond to dropping the two-
loop contributions to the schwinger-dyson equations and approximating the
dressed 1pi 3-point vertex with a bare vertex. this truncation works well for
many theories, as we will see. but in an abelian gauge theory, for example,
a ward identity relates the dressed 3-point vertex to a dressed propagator.
this makes it inconsistent to work with dressed propagators but bare ver-
tices; the inconsistency shows up in the fact that the one-loop gap equations
with bare vertices do not have a solution.8 methods for dealing with this dif-
culty have been proposed [28, 29], but they do not seem to be compatible
with manifest supersymmetry. an adequate analysis of the 0-brane quantum
mechanics calls for a more satisfactory treatment of this issue [34]. in section
5, when we apply the gaussian approximation to a bosonic large-n gauge
theory, we will dodge the issue of ward identities, by avoiding the use of the
full set of one-loop gap equations.

3 scalar models with supersymmetry

in this section we apply the gaussian approximation to study the strong-
coupling behavior of some quantum mechanics problems having n = 2 su-
persymmetry but no gauge symmetry. the goal is twofold: to learn how

to apply the gaussian approximation to a supersymmetric system, and to
test the gaussian approximation against some of the well understood strong-
coupling dynamics present in these simple systems. the main lesson is that
the gaussian approximation works well, provided that it is formulated in a
way which respects supersymmetry. eectively this requires formulating the
gaussian approximation in superspace: gap equations must be introduced
for the auxiliary elds.

3.1 a model with a moduli space

we begin by considering a model with three scalar superelds and a super-
potential w = 123. the minkowski space action is (see appendix a for
supersymmetry conventions)

sm =

fafa

fabcsabc + a bcsabc

where sabc = +1 if a, b, c are distinct, 0 otherwise. non-perturbatively it is
known that the model has a moduli space of vacua9 localized along the 1,
2, 3 coordinate axes. thus the spectrum of the hamiltonian is continuous
from zero, and the free energy falls o like a power law at low temperatures.

in studying this model, our goal is to show that the gaussian approxima-
tion captures this power-law behavior of the free energy at low temperatures.
this is not a trivial result, because going to low temperatures is equiva-
lent to going to strong coupling: the coupling constant g2 is dimensionful,
g2  (length)3, so the dimensionless eective coupling is g2
e = g2/t 3. we
henceforth adopt units in which g2 = 1.

we use an imaginary time formalism, wick rotating according to

se = ism

fa e = ifa m .

note that we have to wick rotate the auxiliary elds in order to make the
quadratic terms in the action well-behaved in euclidean space. expanding

2 < (s  s0)2 >c,0, and the bottom curve is (f0 + 1.04).

13

to solve the gap equations (16) one has to resort to numerical methods.
an eective technique is to start by solving the gap equations analytically at
high temperatures, where the loop sums are dominated by the bosonic zero
modes 2
l=0. one can then repeatedly use the newton-raphson method
[35] to solve the system at a sequence of successively smaller temperatures,
using the solution at inverse temperature  as the starting point for newton-
raphson at  + . further details on the numerical algorithm are given in
appendix b.

l=0,  2

we have solved this system numerically up to  = 28.5, corresponding to

a dimensionless coupling g2

e = g23  104. the resulting free energy

f  f0+ < s  s0 >0 

1
2

< (s  s0)2 >c,0

(17)

is shown in fig. 4. from the plot it seems clear that the energy of the sys-
tem  given by the slope of f  vanishes as the temperature goes to zero,
so the gaussian approximation has captured the fact that supersymmetry
is unbroken in this model. note that loop corrections to the auxiliary eld
propagators were crucial in obtaining this result  if we had formulated a
gaussian approximation just for the physical degrees of freedom, the ap-
proximation itself would have explicitly broken supersymmetry.

moreover, in the low-temperature regime, the numerical results for the

individual terms in the free energy are well t by

f0 = 1.04  0.7051.16
< s  s0 >0= 2.581.11
1

2

< (s  s0)2 >c,0= 1.771.11 .

(18)

this behavior can be seen in fig. 5, where we have plotted these quantities
on a loglog scale.

evidently f0 approaches a non-zero constant at low temperatures, in-
dicating an eective ground-state degeneracy of the system.
it would be
interesting to understand whether such a degeneracy is really present, or
whether it is perhaps an artifact of the gaussian approximation.10

what is more interesting for our purposes is that the subleading behavior
of f0, as well as the corrections < s  s0 >0 and  1
2 < (s  s0)2 >c,0, all
vanish like a power law at low temperatures, with about the same exponent.

10the spectrum of the hamiltonian is continuous from zero, so the usual argument that
f  0 as    does not apply. in fact it is not even clear whether the zero-temperature
partition function for this model is well-dened, since it may depend on how one regulates
divergences coming from the innite volume of moduli space.

14

it seems plausible that all the higher-order corrections will also follow roughly
the same power law.
if this is the case then the gaussian approximation
provides a good estimate of the exponent. the coecient in front of the
power law is more dicult to obtain, but one might hope that keeping just
the rst three terms as in (17) is not such a bad approximation. this leads
to a numerical t

f  1.04  4.771.09 .

non-perturbatively this theory is known to have a unique supersymmetric
vacuum localized near  = 0 [36]. in this section we study the nite tempera-
ture behavior of this model using the gaussian approximation, and show that
it reproduces this known behavior in the limit of zero temperature. moreover
we will use the gaussian approximation to obtain an estimate for the energy
gap to the rst excited state of the system. this is non-trivial because, just
as in the previous section, going to low temperature is equivalent to going to
strong coupling: the dimensionless eective coupling is g2
e = g2/t 2. from
now on we set g2 = 1.

but this is exactly the low temperature expansion one would expect for
the free energy of a system with a unique zero energy ground state (a short
multiplet of the n = 2 supersymmetry) plus a degenerate pair of rst excited

states with energyp3/2 (a long multiplet of n = 2).

we conclude by examining the second-order corrections to the free energy

of this model. after imposing the gap equations one nds that

although exponentially suppressed, this larger than the contribution of the
rst two terms (23) by a factor of . combining the results (23), (24) we see
that the expression for the free energy at low temperatures has the form

f = 2e3/2(cid:16)1 + p2/3 +   (cid:17) + o(cid:16)e6(cid:17) .

17

presumably the second-order term can be interpreted as correcting the energy
gap to the rst excited state. it would be interesting to nd a set of gap
equations for which the second order term in the free energy is subdominant
at low temperatures.

this model is known to break supersymmetry [36]. this is an eect which
cannot happen at any nite order in perturbation theory, but we will see that
it is captured by the gaussian approximation: the ground state energy comes
out positive. this provides an interesting contrast to the usual analysis of
supersymmetry breaking via instantons [37], which can be applied to this
model once a suciently large mass perturbation is introduced. a related
analysis of supersymmetry breaking in the o(n) -model was carried out by
zanon [31].

the o(2) r-symmetry prohibits any   f mixing, and implies <  >= 0,
but allows a tadpole for f . the expectation value of f is the order parameter
for supersymmetry breaking. to take it into account we shift f  a + f ,
with < f >= 0. the euclidean action is11

the gap equations for this model must be solved numerically. we show
the result for a =< f > in fig. 6. the key point is that < f > approaches a
non-zero constant at low temperatures, < f > 0.50, so that supersymmetry
is indeed broken. this is reected in a positive slope of f , corresponding to
positive vacuum energy. the numerical results can be t at low temperatures
by

f0 = 0.33 + 0.21

note that, although the vacuum energy is non-zero, it is not given by the

4 gauge dynamics and the gross-witten tran-

sition

in this section we discuss a generic feature of large-n gauge theory: the
existence of a gross-witten transition [38].12 we will argue that such a
transition separates the weak-coupling and strong-coupling regimes of the
gauge theory.

suppose we have a 0 + 1 dimensional u(n) gauge theory at nite tem-
perature. although the gauge eld a0( ) has no local degrees of freedom,
one can construct a non-local observable by diagonalizing the wilson line.

u = p eir 

0 d a0 =

ei1

0

. . .

0

ein



the eigenvalues 1, . . . , n characterize the gauge-invariant degrees of free-
dom contained in a0 (up to permutation by the weyl group).

as discussed in [39], for most theories the eigenvalue distribution will
be quite dierent at high and low temperatures. this can be understood

12by gross-witten transition we mean a large-n phase transition triggered by a change

in the eigenvalue distribution, not necessarily a third order phase transition.

21

as a competition between entropy and energy. the haar measure for the
eigenvalues, corresponding to wilson lines which are uniformly distributed
over the u(n) group manifold, is given by [40]

yi

diyi<j

(1  cos(i  j)) .

the measure vanishes whenever two eigenvalues coincide. so in the absence
of any other interactions, the eigenvalues tend to repel each other, and spread
out over the circle in order to maximize their entropy.

on the other hand, energetic considerations often lead to attractive in-
teractions between eigenvalues. as a simple example, suppose we minimally
couple the gauge eld to a massive adjoint scalar eld. integrating out the
scalar eld produces an additional contribution to the measure for the eigen-
values, given by

i


(i  j)(cid:19)2

+ m2#

det 1"(cid:18) +
yi<j
=yi<j

1

2 (cosh m  cos(i  j))

.

(29)

in the high temperature regime m  1 this gives a strong attraction be-
tween eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues will tend to cluster to minimize their
energy. but at low temperatures the potential (29) attens out, and entropy
wins: the eigenvalues will spread out around the circle.

this phenomenon seems to be quite generic: eigenvalues will tend to clus-
ter at high temperatures, and spread out at low temperatures. this should
happen even in supersymmetric theories.13 of course in quantum mechanics
at nite n one has smooth crossover between these two qualitatively dierent
behaviors. but in the large n limit a sharp gross-witten phase transition
should occur when the eigenvalues can rst explore the entire circle.

we conclude with a few remarks on this phenomenon in the context of
d-brane physics; for a review of the phases of d-brane gauge theories see
[41].

1. the phenomenon is well-known, at least for d-branes which are wrapped
on a spatial circle. it is responsible for the transition between singly-
wound and multiply-wound strings discussed in [42, 43], and the related
black hole transitions discussed in [44]. weve merely pointed out that
13while bosons generate an attractive potential which is minimized when i  j = 0,

fermions give rise to a repulsive potential that repels away from i  j = .

22

at nite temperature the same transition takes place in euclidean time:
0-brane worldlines can become multiply wound around the time direc-
tion. only the multiply-wound phase corresponds to a black hole.

2. in a t-dual picture the eigenvalues of the holonomy become the po-
sitions of d-instantons on the dual circle. at high temperatures the
dual circle is large, and the d-instantons tend to cluster. but at low
temperatures, when the dual circle is small, the d-instantons will de-
localize. note that only in the low-temperature regime could one hope
to describe the conguration as a black hole, using a static solution to
the supergravity equations.

let us make a crude estimate of the transition temperature from the
d-instanton point of view. consider a system of n d-instantons in
iib string theory with string coupling gb and string length ls. rea-
soning analogous to [45, 46] shows that in uncompactied space the
d-instantons will cluster and ll out a region of size l  (gbn)1/4ls.
compactifying the time direction on a circle of size b, we expect the
d-instantons to delocalize if b < l. mapping to type iia via

a = /b

g2
a = g2

b/2
b

we conclude that the 0-brane worldlines are multiply-wound when

a > crit = (gan)1/3ls  (g2

y m n)1/3 .

(30)

3. the transition at crit can be seen in several ways from the supergravity
point of view. the background geometry of a system of 0-branes in the
decoupling limit is well-dened above crit. below crit the curvature at
the horizon exceeds the string scale, and the dual gauge theory becomes
weakly coupled [24].

the transition can also be identied with the horowitz-polchinski cor-
respondence point [47]. consider a non-extremal black hole in ten di-
mensions with 0-brane charge. following [12, 14], one can map this to
a ten-dimensional schwarzschild black hole by lifting to eleven dimen-
sions, boosting in the covering space, and recompactifying. we discuss
this transformation in appendix c. if the original charged black hole is
at the critical temperature, then the equivalent neutral black hole turns
out to have a schwarzschild radius close to the string scale. that is,
the temperature tcrit maps to the horowitz-polchinski correspondence
point, at which a black hole is on the verge of becoming an elementary
string state.

4. although our primary interest is in quantum mechanics, it is natural
to suppose that similar transitions happen in other dimensions. for

23

example, consider 3 + 1 dimensional n = 4 large-n yang-mills on
r3  s1. for any non-zero temperature it seems natural to expect that
a gross-witten transition occurs when the t hooft coupling  = g2
y m n
is of order one.

to conclude, we expect that gross-witten transitions are generically
present in large-n gauge theories at nite temperature. in theories with a
dual string interpretation this suggests that a phase transition occurs, which
separates the non-geometric phase from the phase with a well-dened back-
ground geometry (see also [48, 49]).

5 large-n models in the gaussian approxi-

mation

in this section we use the gaussian approximation to study some large-n
matrix quantum mechanics problems. one motivation for the problems we
consider is that they arise as subsectors of the 0-brane quantum mechanics.
the 0-brane quantum mechanics can be written in terms of n = 2 superelds
as [50] (see appendix a)

here fi is the eld strength constructed from a gauge multiplet , the a
are a collection of seven adjoint scalar multiplets transforming in the 7 of
g2, and fabc is a suitably normalized14 totally antisymmetric g2-invariant
tensor.15

in the next section we drop all the fermions, and (with nine scalar elds)
study the bosonic sector of this action. in the following section we drop the
gauge multiplet , and study the supersymmetric dynamics of the scalar
multiplets a.

15under an so(2)  so(7) subgroup of the so(9) r-symmetry the physical fermions
transform as an 8 of so(7), which decomposes into 7 1 of g2. thus one of the fermions
becomes part of the n = 2 gauge multiplet, while the remaining seven transform in the 7
of g2.

5.1 bosonic large-n gauge theory

in this section we study a purely bosonic quantum mechanics problem: the
reduction of d + 1 dimensional u(n) yang-mills theory to 0 + 1 dimensions.
we will study this theory at leading order for large n using the gaussian
approximation. the goal is to show that the gaussian approximation re-
spects t hooft large-n counting, and can capture the gross-witten phase
transition which we expect to be present. we will also learn a few useful
lessons about 0-brane quantum mechanics.

the degrees of freedom of this model consist of d adjoint scalar elds xi,

coupled to a gauge eld a0. the euclidean action is

where d =  + i[a0,  ]. we set  a0 = 0, so that a0 = const.  1 a00.
corresponding to this gauge choice we must introduce a system of periodic
ghost elds , . in fourier modes the complete action is16

next we need to choose an action s0 to use as the basis for the approxima-
tion.17 up to now we have always taken s0 to be quadratic in the fundamental
elds. but this is not appropriate for gauge theory, because the eigenvalues
of a00 are angular variables. so it is better to work with the holonomy

u = p eih d a0 = eia00 .

the gaussian action we propose to use is

s0 =

strictly speaking, we propose to use this action to describe the relative eigen-
values of the u(n) gauge theory. that is, u really takes values in the group

16note that our gauge condition leaves a residual global u (n ) gauge symmetry unbro-

ken. we have suppressed the corresponding ghost zero mode l=0.

17out of habit we will keep calling it the gaussian approximation, even when s0 is not

strictly gaussian.

25

su(n)/zn . but we will largely ignore this distinction, since it does not
aect leading large-n counting.

although the action s0 is not strictly gaussian, it is soluble, at least in
the large-n limit: the action for u is the one-plaquette model studied by
gross and witten [38]. we briey recall some results. the one-plaquette
partition function is

with a third-order phase transition at  = 2. diagonalizing the holonomy,

that the transition is weakly second-order: the second derivative of f0+ <

artifact of the approximation; a third order phase transition would seem
more plausible.

the physics here is equally simple: the n 2d oscillators have all been frozen
into their ground state. we see that the ground state energy of an individual
oscillator is very large, of order (g2
y m n)1/3, while the ground state wave-
function of an individual oscillator is extremely narrow, being a gaussian of
width

y m n)1/3/n .

it is only when all of the uctuations are added together in rrms that the
system as a whole has a very large ground state size, rrms  (g2

y m n)1/3.

before arguing that the gaussian approximation really does give reliable
results for this system, let us pause to compare the behavior of this bosonic
system to the behavior expected of 0-brane quantum mechanics [45, 46]. the

29

full 0-brane system corresponds to d = 9 and diers by including sixteen ad-
joint fermions. in the high temperature regime, we expect that the fermions
can be neglected on general grounds (from the path integral point of view
they are squeezed out by their antiperiodic boundary conditions). so the
results (39) should be a good approximation to the behavior of 0-branes at
high temperature. on the other hand, in the low temperature regime the
0-brane system has a dual supergravity description [24]. the size of the re-
y m n)1/3 is expected to match the
gion in which supergravity is valid  (g2
size of the ground state wavefunction of the supersymmetric gauge theory.
we see that the scale (g2
y m n)1/3 already appears as the size of the bosonic
ground state wavefunction. so it seems that including the fermions should
not signicantly change the size of the wavefunction. the fermions do en-
ter in a crucial way in the supersymmetric theory, however, because they
are necessary for cancelling the enormous bosonic ground state energy which
appears in (40).

we will now argue that the gaussian approximation provides a good de-
scription of this bosonic gauge theory for all values of the temperature. of
course the gaussian approximation is good in the high-temperature regime,
where the gauge theory is weakly coupled and the action (32) is approxi-
mately gaussian. but it is also a good approximation at low temperatures.
to establish this, let us examine the second-order corrections to the ground
state energy of the system.

the second-order correction  1

2 < (ss0)2 >c,0 is a sum of several terms.
but contributions involving the gauge eld propagator can be neglected at
low temperatures, because 2
0  0 as    (the zero mode of the gauge
eld becomes frozen as the circle decompacties). most of the remaining
terms cancel when the gap equations are imposed, leaving just

(the three-loop integral is easiest to do in position space). combining this
with previous results gives the rst three terms in the reorganized perturba-

19presumably this model admits an expansion in 1/d. it would be interesting to under-

stand this expansion, and its relation to the gaussian approximation.

30

as claimed, the higher order terms in reorganized perturbation theory make
a small correction to the free energy, even in the strong-coupling, low tem-
perature regime. based on the size of the second order correction, we can
claim to have computed the ground state energy of this system to within
roughly one percent accuracy for the case of 9 scalar elds.

5.2 a supersymmetric large-n scalar model

in fact, in the gaussian approximation, this g2-invariant model is iso-
morphic to the 123 model studied in section 3.1. the gap equations (43)
can be exactly mapped to those of the 123 model by dening

new = a1/3
2
new = a2/32
2
new = 2
hnew = a1/3h .

restoring units, note that a is essentially the t hooft coupling, so that new
is the physical temperature measured in units of the t hooft coupling. with

31

this redenition one nds that f0, < s s0 >0 and < (s s0)2 >c,0 for the
g2 model transform into the corresponding quantities for the 123 model,
up to an overall factor of 7n 2/3. thus all the results of section 3.1 can be
taken over and applied to the g2 model. in particular, the free energy falls
o as 1.1

new at low temperatures.

6 conclusions

in this paper weve discussed an approximation scheme which can be used to
study strongly-coupled quantum mechanics problems. weve shown that the
approximation can be formulated in a way which respects supersymmetry,
by introducing gap equations for the auxiliary elds. weve also shown that
it can be applied to large-n theories: indeed t hooft scaling is automatic,
provided that one keeps just the planar contribution to the gap equations.

we used the approximation to study a number of toy models of scalar
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and found that it captures the correct
qualitative behavior of the free energy at strong coupling. moreover, it pro-
vides a quantitative estimate of certain quantities, such as the ground state
energy or low-lying density of states, which would be dicult to obtain by
any other means.

the approximation has diculty dealing with gauge symmetry, since the
gap equations tend to violate the ward identities. nonetheless, we were able
to study a large-n gauge theory: the bosonic sector of 0-brane quantum
mechanics. the gaussian approximation provides a remarkably accurate de-
scription of the ground state of this theory. the approximation also predicts
that a gross-witten phase transition occurs when the eective coupling is of
order one.

we argued that such a phase transition should be present in a generic
large-n gauge theory, in particular for the full 0-brane quantum mechan-
ics. this means that the perturbative gauge theory regime of the 0-brane
quantum mechanics is separated from the supergravity regime by a mild
phase transition.
it also suggests that the horowitz-polchinski correspon-
dence point is associated with a phase transition.

of course our motivation for this project was to develop techniques for
understanding 0-brane quantum mechanics. we have been able to incor-
porate many of the necessary ingredients into the approximation, including
supersymmetry and large-n counting. but an adequate analysis of the full
0-brane quantum mechanics requires a more satisfactory treatment of gauge

32

invariance [34].

a supersymmetry in quantum mechanics

in this appendix we review the superspace construction of n = 2 theories in
0 + 1 dimensions.

with n = 2 supersymmetry we have an so(2) r-symmetry, with spinor
indices ,  = 1, 2 and vector indices i, j = 1, 2. the so(2)r dirac matrices
are real, symmetric, and traceless; for example one can choose 1 = 1 and
2 = 3 where 1 and 3 are pauli matrices. given two spinors  and ,
besides the invariant , one can construct a second invariant which we
will denote

n = 2 superspace has coordinates (t, ) where  is real.20 denoting 2 =

which obey the algebra

{q, q} = 2it
{q, d} = 0
{d, d} = 2it .

20our convention is that complex conjugation reverses the order of grassmann variables.

the simplest representation of supersymmetry is a real scalar supereld

in some cases we can extend the so(2) r-symmetry to an o(2)r, where
. both the measure d2 and the
the extra zz2 (r-parity) acts as   2
kinetic term are odd under r-parity. thus r-parity is a symmetry if the
superpotential is odd in , with    under r-parity.

to describe gauge theories we introduce a real connection on superspace

 = d + 
t = t + it

with the gauge transformation  = i, t = t. the correspond-
ing eld strengths f, f are real superelds given by
{,} = 2it + f
{t,} = f

we impose the so-called conventional constraint f = 0, which implies
that f is a vector of so(2)r:

f = 2i

this xes t in terms of the spinor connection , but does not constrain

we write the expansion of  in linear components as

 + d + 22 .

the elds x i are physical scalars, while  are their superpartners, d is an
auxiliary boson,  are auxiliary fermions, and a0 is the 0+1 dimensional

34

gauge eld. these linear component elds are of primary interest: by using
them to formulate the gaussian approximation we are eectively making a
gaussian approximation in superspace for the supereld , and such an
approximation is guaranteed to respect supersymmetry. but it is also useful
to dene the covariant component elds

these covariant component elds transform in the usual way under conven-

b solving gap equations numerically

the gap equations are an innite set of coupled non-linear equations which
determine the fourier modes of the propagators. in general we must resort
to numerical methods in order to solve them.

an important simplication follows from the fact that quantum mechanics
is uv free. thus at large momenta the propagators have free-eld behavior,
and at any given value of the temperature we only need to solve the gap
equations to determine a nite number of fourier modes.
in the moduli
space model of section 3.1 we obtained good results by solving for modes
with 1.8 < l, r < 1.8.

we are left with a nite set of equations, which we solved numerically
using the newton-raphson method. let us briey summarize the method.
consider a system of equations

fi(x1, . . . , xn) = 0

i = 1, . . . , n .

(45)

we start by guessing a solution ~xold, and expand ~f to rst order around ~xold.
solving the linearized equations gives an improved guess

where

~xnew = ~xold + ~x

~x = j1 ~fold

jij =

(46)

(47)

fi

xj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)~xold

if the initial guess is suciently close to a root, this procedure can be iterated
a few times and will rapidly converge. we found that ve or six iterations
gave excellent results in the moduli space model. the newton-raphson
method does suer from poor global convergence, but this can be improved
using a procedure known as backtracking [35].

even with backtracking one needs an initial guess that is suciently close
to the actual solution. one strategy is to start out at high temperatures.
then the gap equations are dominated by the zero modes, and one can obtain
an approximate solution analytically. for example, consider the moduli space
model. at high temperatures (  1) the gap equations are approximately
solved by

0 = p

2
 2
0 = 1/2
hr = /2r

2
l6=0 = (/2l)2
 2
l6=0 = 1

(48)

this can be used as a starting point for newton-raphson. then one can
solve the system at a sequence of successively lower temperatures, using the
solution at one temperature as the initial guess for the next temperature. in
the moduli space model we found that increasing  by a factor of 1.2 at each
step worked well.

the gap equations can also be solved to determine the large-momentum
behavior of the propagators at any temperature, up to constants that can be

36

extracted from the numerical solution for the low-momentum modes. for ex-
ample, in the moduli space model, the propagators at large momenta behave
as

where

note that the asymptotic forms of the propagators are related in the expected
way, given by the naive supersymmetry ward identities.

in fact the high momentum behavior is important for computing the free
energy. even in quantum mechanics one has to deal with the divergent

l . this sum, which appears in f0, can be dened by

c black hole  sym correspondence

we discuss the connection between ten dimensional schwarzschild black holes
and nite temperature sym quantum mechanics. we relate the two theo-
ries by boosting an eleven dimension black string and recompactifying it
on a smaller circle to keep the entropy the same [12, 14]. although this
transformation is not a symmetry of the theory, it does preserve some of its
properties, and therefore can be used to identify phenomena on the black
hole side with phenomena in the gauge theory.

c.1 boosted black string

we start with the black string solution in eleven dimensions
11 = h(r)dt2 + h1(r)dr2 + r2d8 + dz2

ds2

h(r) = 1

r7 .

(51)

37

if the eleventh dimension z is compactied on a circle of radius r one can
reduce this metric to get the ten dimensional metric of a schwarzschild black
hole in type iia string theory. the black hole mass and entropy are given
by (lp is the eleven dimensional planck length)

following [12, 14] we boost in the z direction (in the covering space) with
boost parameter , and recompactify the new z direction on a circle with
radius

r =

(53)

r

cosh 

this radius is chosen so that the resulting ten dimensional charged black hole
will have the same entropy (52) as the schwarzschild black hole.

in string frame the charged black hole solution is

ds2 = f1/2(r)h(r)dt2 + f 1/2(r)[h1(r)dr2 + r2d2

we will eventually take the limit    with r0 xed (this limit was also
considered in [51, 52, 53]), so we wont distinguish between sinh  and cosh .
in this limit the number of unit charge d0-branes is given by dividing the
adm mass of the black hole by 1/r,

this is indeed the near horizon geometry of a 0-brane black hole. this

c.2 parameter identication

to give a precise identication between the schwarzschild black hole and
the gauge theory we recall that a near extremal black hole has the following
energy density, temperature and entropy density [24].

the above equations are only reliable if the supergravity approximation
is valid near the horizon of the black hole  that is, if the dilaton is small
and the curvature is small in string units. the condition for small curvature
near the horizon is u 3p
0  e2, and the point where the curvature is order
one is t  u0. as a passing observation note that while the thermodynamics
depends on p, one has a relation e  e2n 2t 2u 2
0 which holds independent
of p, aside from the exact numerical factor.

now we can make identications between the schwarzschild black hole
and the gauge theory. we consider the case p = 0. on the schwarzschild
black hole side there are three parameters m, r, lp. on the gauge theory
side there is n, e, g2

there is one issue we would like to comment on. the specic heat of
a schwarzschild black hole is negative, while the gauge theory clearly has a
positive specic heat. nonetheless their thermodynamics can be identied,
since we hold dierent quantities xed when we take derivatives with respect
to the temperature (the temperature is the same on both sides). in the gauge
theory we hold n and g2
y m xed, but on the supergravity side we hold r and
lp xed. this is responsible for the dierence. thus the negative specic heat
of the schwarzschild black hole is not in contradiction with its description in
terms of thermodynamics of an ordinary eld theory (see also [10]).

now lets look at some transition points:

1. when r = r0 the black string becomes unstable and turns into an
eleven dimensional black hole [55]. our formulas are only appropriate
for r < r0. at this point one nds

s1 = n
r1 = n 5/9e2/3
t1 = e2/3n5/9
l2
p = e4/3n 2/9 .

(67)

this is the bfks point [9, 15].

2. at r = lp the black string is better described as a ten dimensional

black hole and the string theory has gs = 1. at this point

s2 = n 8/7
r2 = n 1/3e2/3
t2 = e2/3n10/21 .

(68)

3. consider the point where the schwarzschild black hole has a horizon
p/r. we nd the corre-

size of the order the string length, r2
sponding gauge theory parameters

0 = l2

s = l3

s3 = n 2
r3 = e2/3n1
t3 = e2/3

gs =

1
n

.

(69)

this is the point where the curvature at the horizon of the charged
black hole becomes of order one. beyond this point the eective cou-
pling of the gauge theory is small. we have argued in this paper that
at this point there is a phase transition. we now see that this tran-
sition occurs at the horowitz-polchinski correspondence point, where
the schwarzschild black hole turns into an elementary string state [47].
