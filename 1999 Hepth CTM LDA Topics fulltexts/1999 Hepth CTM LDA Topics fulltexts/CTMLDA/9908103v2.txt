abstract

we calculate the chiral anomaly in the neighbourhood of the xed point space mh which
is constructed by the group action of a discrete symmetry h on a compact manifold m.
the feynman diagrams approach for the corresponding supersymmetric quantum mechanical
system with twisted boundary conditions is used. the result we derive in this way agrees with
the generalization of the ordinary index theorem (the g-index theorem) on the spin complex.

1 introduction

anomalies of quantum eld theories in the path integral approach can be interpreted, according
to fujikawa [1], as a symptom of the impossibility of dening an invariant measure in the func-
tional integral which determines the graviton theory under investigation. therefore symmetries
of the classical action cease to be conserved at the quantum level. for a massless fermion , in
even-dimensions, the action of the eld theory is given by:
(x)

l = (det e

) e

(1)

where  =  + 1
4ab(e)ab, with ab the spin connection. chiral anomaly is associated
with the innitesimal local transformation    + (x)5 where  is a complex space-time
dependent function. fujikawa found that for a spin- 1
2 loop the chiral anomaly is given by the
regulated jacobian lim0 t rh5(cid:16) 

the computation of anomalies using fujikawas scheme was soon realized to be very cumber-
some when trying to evaluate traces in n-dimensions involving products of  matrices. a new
procedure based on one-dimensional quantum mechanics was then proposed by alvarez-gaume
and witten [2]. according to this method the operators 5, , x,  were represented by
operators of a corresponding quantum mechanical model, and by turning these operator ex-
pressions into path integrals, one nds that anomalies of quantum eld theories can be written
in terms of feynman diagrams for certain sigma models on the worldline.

h d/d/(cid:17)i, and d/d/ is the regulator.

in the case of chiral anomalies the partition function receives contributions from periodic
bosonic coordinates and the projection operator (1)f replaces the antiperiodic boundary
conditions for the fermions with periodic ones. it is worth noting that chiral anomalies due to
their topological nature are insensitive to the method used for calculating them in contrast to
the trace anomalies which are not.

in this article we introduce twisted boundary conditions for bosons and fermions induced
by automorphic maps of the base manifold. for convenience we consider zn as the discrete
isometry group. the twisted chiral anomaly will be given by the trace:

an(chiral) = lim
0

t r(cid:16)(1)f pe 
h h(cid:17)

(2)

where (1)f is the 4n analogue of 5, f is the one-dimensional fermion number, p is a projec-
tion operator which selects those states of the total hilbert space that remain invariant under
the group action and h is the n = 1 supersymmetric hamiltonian. the paths of the points
that belong to the group invariant subspace dominate in the functional integral. away from
the xed point space the corresponding contributions are exponentially suppressed.

the extra contribution to the chiral anomaly stems from the vacuum expectation value of
a vertex that couples the complex zero modes of periodic fermions with the complex bosonic
quantum uctuations. writing then the chiral anomaly as a double sum of the relevant twisted
worldline graphs all satisfying the same boundary conditions, we recover the standard result of
the literature [3, 4, 5].

2 the group action and the hilbert space

we consider a compact riemannian manifold m (which might be curved with nontrivial metric)
of even dimension dimm = 4n with coordinates described by the real bosonic elds x( ). in
the supersymmetric quantum mechanics we also have majorana fermions living on the sections
of the pullback of the tangent bundle of the tangent space tm with dimtm = 4n. when our
base manifold has a discrete isometry h  g then there is a submanifold mh (possibly of non
vanishing dimension) that remains invariant under the corresponding group action. we may
also assume that the manifold m is kahler equipped with a complex structure j preserved
under the action of h:
(3)
if the normal bundle nm(mh)

where the asterisk represents push-forward of the vectors.
decomposes into at complex bundles then the real dimension at a point p of mh is:

h  j = j  h

dimmh|p = m = 4n  2s.

(4)

the above constraint implies that mh is of even dimension. the specic choice for the dimen-
sion of the base manifold is implied by the existence of the untwisted chiral anomaly only in
4n-dimensions. note that we may use for mh the same j as that used for m.
the rotation:

let h be an orientation preserving map which generates the zn transformation realised by

  x2i( )
x2i1( ) !    cos i  sin i

sin i

cos i !  x2i( )

x2i1( ) !

(5)

where i = 1, . . . , dimnm(mh)/2, i = 2
ui is an orthogonal matrix it can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix mi:

n ki, ki = 0, . . . , n  1 and ui satises u n

i = 1. since

miuim 

i = ui,diag

(6)

2

from which one obtains:

ui,diag =   gki 0

gki !

0

(7)

with g = e2i/n 1 . in this way the eigenvalues of ui fall into two subsets ngkio and ngkio.

thus, adopting complex notation for the bosons on the normal bundle we impose the fol-

lowing twisted boundary conditions:

  x i
xi ! =

1

2   x2i + ix2i1

x2i  ix2i1 !    gki 0

0

gki !  x i
xi !

(8)

and similar twisted conditions hold for the fermions on the tangent space. thus the base
manifold coordinates split into the following set:

x = (xl, x i, xi)

(9)

where xl, l = 1,   , m describe the xed point manifold. these coordinates can be decomposed
into background trajectories obeying the boundary condition xl
bg( = 0) and a
quantum uctuating part with ql( = 1) = ql( = 0) = 0. on the other hand the x i, xi,
i,i = 1,   , (4n  m)/2 describe the manifold normal to mg and the appearance of twisted
boundary conditions does not allow the existence of a classical part but permits only a quantum
part (denoted by qi, qi respectively).

bg( = 1) = xl

recalling the standard lore or orbifold theories [6], each ki-sector (one for each conjugacy
2. the total hilbert

class in the group) has its own mode expansion and hilbert space hki
space is the direct sum of hki:

the physical hilbert space hi
all hki:

phys consists of states that remain invariant under the action of

notice that p i is indeed a projection operator since ( p i)2 = p i and hkj

p i = p i.

1the explicit form of mi is: mi =(cid:18) 
2in the non-abelian case the twisted sectors should be labeled by the conjugacy classes ci of the group g.
the projection operator is replaced by p = pi
g{h} where the centralizer ni is dened by ni =
{g|h  ci : [g, h] = 0} and the action of any g  ni on {h} is dened by g{h} = (g{h}, l1gl1

the rst term corresponds to the familiar interaction (15) on the base manifold while the second

the propagator for bosons that move along the bres r2 of the normal bundle is:

3in principle one could compute an innite set of feynman diagrams with a spin- 1

2 eld circulating in a loop
and external gravitons couple at the vertices of the fermion loop. the advantage of the background formalism
is encaptulated in the fact that it takes the contributions of all vertices at once.
4the signicance of such ghosts is implied by the integration over the momenta p( ) in the transition from
phase space to conguration space. a factor g is then produced and by exponentiating it, introducing the
lee-yang ghosts, we are led to a perfectly regular term in the action.

and in addition, it is subjected to the boundary condition:

4 twisted chiral anomaly

the untwisted chiral anomaly, in which both bosonic and fermionic elds are periodic, can be
written equivalently as in [7]:

at rst sight the expression (25) is obscured since for example r4 could equally mean tr(r4)
or tr(r2)tr(r2). the recipee one has to apply is to write down the series for the logarithm,
replace rm  tr(rm) everywhere, and only then one should take the exponential.
the total integrated chiral anomaly of the relevant worldline graphs to be proportional to:

sider now a closed q-loop with an odd number of vertices ( 1

and perform all the contractions of the related quantum bosonic elds (two at each vertex
namely q( ),

attached bosonic elds (at a given time) will give, apart from a numerical factor, a result
 grr2k = 0. only parity violating amplitudes are anomalous and thus the twisted chiral
anomaly receives contributions exclusively from even values of l. therefore the anomaly is

5 conclusions

we have extended the feynman diagrams formalism developed by the authors [7, 8] to calculate
chiral anomalies when twisted boundary conditions are present. the starting point was the
expression that incorporates all the q-loop contributions to the chiral anomaly in which all
bosons were subjected to identical boundary conditions.

a complete and meticulous examination of this problem would require steps similar to those
presented in [7, 8] but this task is postponed for a future investigation. it is belevied our result

to be changed only by a numerical factor which for the untwisted case was found to be (cid:16) i
