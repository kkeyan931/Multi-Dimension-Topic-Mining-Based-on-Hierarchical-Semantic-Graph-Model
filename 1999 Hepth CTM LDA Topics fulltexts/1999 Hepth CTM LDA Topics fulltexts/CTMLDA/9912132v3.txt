abstract

we provide an algebraic classication of all supersymmetric domain wall solutions of
maximal gauged supergravity in four and seven dimensions, in the presence of non-
trivial scalar elds in the coset sl(8, ir)/so(8) and sl(5, ir)/so(5) respectively. these
solutions satisfy rst-order equations, which can be obtained using the method of bo-
gomolnyi. from an eleven-dimensional point of view they correspond to various con-
tinuous distributions of m2- and m5-branes. the christoelschwarz transformation
and the uniformization of the associated algebraic curves are used in order to determine
the schrodinger potential for the scalar and graviton uctuations on the corresponding
backgrounds. in many cases we explicitly solve the schrodinger problem by employing
techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the analysis is parallel to the con-
struction of domain walls of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity, with scalar elds in the
coset sl(6, ir)/so(6), using algebraic curves or continuous distributions of d3-branes
in ten dimensions. in seven dimensions, in particular, our classication of domain walls
is complete for the full scalar sector of gauged supergravity. we also discuss some general
aspects of d-dimensional gravity coupled to scalar elds in the coset sl(n, ir)/so(n).

1 introduction

recent years have seen an increasing interest in gauged and ungauged supergravities
in various dimensions following the conjectured duality between gauge theories and
string/m-theory [1, 2, 3]. the ads/cft correspondence oers the possibility to un-
derstand strongly coupled gauge theories from a dual supergravity description. the
relevant backgrounds have poincare invariance along the boundary directions and are
asymptotic to anti-de sitter (ads) space. the deviations from the ads geometry in
the interior correspond either to the broken phase of the theory due to non-zero vacuum
expectation values of scalar elds [1], [4]-[12] or to deformations of the conformal eld
theory [13]-[21].

in this paper we shall be concerned only with the rst possibility. in particular, we
will construct a large class of solutions of d = 7 and d = 4 supergravity that are dual to
the (2, 0) theories in six dimensions [22] and the three-dimensional theories with sixteen
supersymmetries [23] on the coulomb branch. these theories correspond to the world
volume theories of parallel m5- and m2-branes respectively. in contrast to the conformal
cases, the solutions include also non-zero scalar elds, which, although they vanish at the
boundary, become large in the interior. these solutions can be lifted to eleven dimensions
describing the gravitational eld of distributions of a large number of m2- or m5-branes.
the location of the branes is directly related to scalar higgs expectation values on the
eld theory side. using such solutions, the spectrum of scalar and graviton excitations as
well as the expectation values of wilson loops can be calculated, shedding new light on
the ads/cft correspondence. such investigations have been carried out for supergravity
duals of n = 4 sym, sometimes with surprising ndings [8, 9, 10]. interestingly, many
of these backgrounds arise as limits of charged ads black holes in the lower-dimensional
gauged supergravity theories or as extremal limits [5, 6, 11] of rotating brane solutions
[24, 5, 25, 26]; they have null singularities near the continuous distributions in the higher
dimensional backgrounds. such singularities arise generically in the ows from confor-
mal to non-conformal theories and it would be interesting to understand them better
from the eld theory side.1 furthermore, these geometries can be viewed as examples
of consistent truncations in various dimensions. the embedding of lower-dimensional
into higher-dimensional supergravities has been worked out explicitly only for a couple of
cases including the s4 and s7 compactications of eleven-dimensional supergravity [28]
to d = 7 [29] and d = 4 [30] gauged supergravity, respectively. more examples of explicit
kaluzaklein ansatze which relate gauged supergravities to ten/eleven-dimensional su-
pergravity have been worked out in the recent papers [31].

1recently, supergravity duals of supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supersymmetries were
constructed and a mechanism for resolving a certain type of space-time singularity was proposed [27].
however, the situation in [27] is dierent because, in n = 2 sym, the classical superconformal point at
the origin of the coulomb branch is removed by quantum eects, whereas the coulomb branch of n = 4
sym is uncorrected. therefore, it is not expected that a similar mechanism is at work for backgrounds
with sixteen supersymmetries.

1

an additional motivation for investigating solutions of gauged supergravity in detail,
as well as the spectra associated to quantum uctuations, stems from the possibility
to apply them to scenarios that view our world as a membrane embedded non-trivially
in a higher dimensional non-factorizable space-time [32]. this old idea has been revived
recently in relation to the mass hierarchy problem [33] (see also [34]). in the latter work a
slice of the ads5 space, where our four dimensional world is embedded, was cut out, thus
resulting in a normalizable graviton zero mode. however, it turns out that there exists
in addition a continuum of massive graviton modes with no mass gap separating them
from the massless one. it was shown in [33] that these modes have negligible eect to
newtons law. however, it is quite desirable in this context to nd ways to model possible
modications of newtons law, since any deviations from it at the sub-millimeter scale
have not been ruled out by the present day experiments (see, for instance, [35]). it is
known, on the other hand, that there are yukawa-type modications to newtons law
in theories that possess a mass gap separating massless from massive graviton modes.
besides the obvious phenomenological advantage of such models, the existence of a mass
gap leads to a well-dened eective eld theory of the standard model of particles plus the
massless graviton. this mass gap should be independent of the details of the slicing or at
least be practically insensitive to them. toy models possessing such desired features have
already been constructed in [36] in the context of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity.
in this sense, many of the models, that we will describe in the present paper, as well as
many of the models in [11], can also be used to further pursue these ideas.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we describe the bosonic sector of
gauged supergravity in d dimensions. the non-zero scalars take values in the coset
space sl(n, ir)/so(n) common to gauged supergravities in any dimension. we re-
strict to vacua with (d  1)-dimensional poincare invariance and nd that for certain
values of d and n the equations can be cast in rst-order form. these bogomolnyi-
type equations are equivalent to killing spinor equations and these solutions preserve
sixteen supersymmetries. in section 3 we present solutions in arbitrary dimensions that
preserve part of the so(n) isometries and examine some of their general features. we
explain how these solutions, for the cases that correspond to gauged supergravity, can
be lifted to string/m-theory, thus showing that they are consistent truncations of ten-
or eleven-dimensional supergravity respectively. these higher-dimensional backgrounds
arise in the ads/cft correspondence as supergravity duals of the eld theories living
on d3, m2 or m5 branes on the coulomb branch. in section 4 we give a general dis-
cussion of the scalar eld equations and graviton uctuations in these backgrounds, and
the mass spectrum of operators in the dual eld theory. our discussion is facilitated by
the fact that the corresponding equations can be cast into one-dimensional schrodinger
equations with appropriately chosen potentials. we also make contact with the theory of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics and outline the necessary elements that will be used
for solving explicitly the schrodinger problem in some cases of current interest. section
5 is devoted to a detailed discussion of the dierential equation for the conformal factor
of the background metrics written in conformally at form. we present a complete clas-

2

sication of solutions with dierent unbroken isometries in terms of irreducible algebraic
curves. the problem of solving the domain-wall equations is then essentially reduced to
the uniformization of the relevant curves and the inversion of the corrsponding functions.
in section 6 we treat in detail distributions of m2-branes, which correspond to curves
with genus g  1. we present their uniformization and obtain explicit expressions for
the conformal factor and the schrodinger potential of the equation for the scalar and
graviton eld uctuations, whenever this is possible in analytic form. in almost all cases
of genus zero, the spectrum can be found exactly, whereas for the other models we uti-
lize the wkb approximation to determine the mass gap and spacing in the spectra. in
section 7 we repeat the same analysis for distributions of m5-branes. we also include, as
application, the calculation of vacuum expectation values of wilson surface operators in
the six-dimensional (0, 2) theories on the coulomb branch using the eleven-dimensional
backgrounds. section 8 contains a summary of the lame equation and its generaliza-
tions, which arise in the study of scalar and graviton uctuations in the background
of domain walls associated to elliptic functions. elements of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics are also used to expose connections between dierent elliptic potentials, and
discuss briey some features of their exact spectrum beyond the wkb approximation.
finally, we end with a short discussion in section 9 and list some open problems.

the present paper generalizes previous work by two of the authors [11], where all
domain-wall solutions of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity with non-trivial scalar
elds in the coset sl(6, ir)/so(6) were classied in terms of algebraic curves. in various
places we include for completeness, but with no further explanation, results on the d =
5, n = 6 theory, which correspond to continuous distributions of d3-branes in ten-
dimensional type-iib supergravity.

2 gauged supergravity and rst-order equations

we consider the sector of gauged supergravity theories with non-trivial elds in the coset
space sl(n, ir)/so(n). this is in general only a subset of a larger coset space and is
common to gauged supergravity theories in any dimension. to be specic we will study
the following lagrangian in d dimensions

l =

n 1

(i )2  p (i) ,

xi=1

(2.1)

although we will be mainly interested in the two cases (d, n) = (4, 8) and (d, n) = (7, 5)
that correspond to a sector of the four- and seven-dimensional gauged supergravities
[30, 29]. another case of interest, corresponding to a sector of the ve-dimensional
gauged supergravity [37, 38], is (d, n) = (5, 6). all other elds including the fermions
are zero. in this subsector the scalar potential p can be expressed in terms of a symmetric
n  n matrix m = st s, where s is an element of sl(n, ir). using an so(n) rotation

3

matrix, m can be diagonalized

m = diag{e21, . . . , e2n} ,

n

xi=1

i = 0 .

(2.2)

in addition, since the determinant of m is 1, it depends on n  1 independent elds. we
parametrize the elds i by the n  1 independent scalars i in the following way

i =

n 1

xi=1

iii ,

(2.3)

where ii is an n  (n  1) matrix. the rows of this matrix correspond to n weights of
the fundamental representation of sl(n), which obey the following normalizations:

iiji = 2ij

n 1

xi=1

(2.4)

then the potential takes the form

p =

32(cid:2)(trm)2  2tr(m 2)(cid:3) .

(2.5)

the equations of motion that follow from varying the action (2.1) with respect to the

metric gm n and the scalars i are

(2.6)

for the applications we have in mind we need the metric to exhibit (d  1)-dimensional
poincare invariance, namely

ds2 = e2a(z)(cid:0)dxdx + dz2(cid:1) =

= e2a(r)dxdx + dr2 ,

(2.7)

where the ralation between the coordinates z and r is such that dr = eadz. furthermore
we assume that the scalars depend only on z and we concentrate on solutions arising from
rst order equations.

the traditional way would be to consider the killing spinor rst-order equations in
the three dierent cases, when (2.1) corresponds to a sector of gauged supergravity, as
it was done for (d, n) = (5, 6) in [8]. that would leave half of the supersymmetries
unbroken. however, there is an alternative way to arrive at rst-order eld equations
using a method `a la bogomolnyi [39]-[42] that will be useful for further generalizations.

this relation will be used to simplify various expressions in the rest of the paper.

(2.13)

note that (2.12) has integer solutions only for the values of n and d that were mentioned
at the beginning of this section, namely (d, n) = (5, 6), (d, n) = (7, 5) and (d, n) =
(4, 8).
in these three cases there exists a maximally supersymmetric solution of the
equations of motion (2.6) that preserves all 32 supercharges, in which all scalar elds are
set to zero and the metric is just adsd. in these cases the potential in (2.5) becomes
p = g2n(n  2)/32 and equals by denition to the negative cosmological constant.
this denes the mass scale g that we have already used. the associated length scale r
dened by g = 2/r will also be used in this paper. the same adsd space is obtained for
general values of d and n when all scalars are set to zero, but then, there is no notion
of supersymmetry.

3 the general solution

we begin this section with the construction of the most general solution of the non-
linear system of equations within the d-dimensional ansatz (2.7) that preserves poincare

5

invariance in the embedded (d1)-dimensional space-time. to keep our considerations as
general as possible we will assume that the scalar eld potential is given by (3.1), but we
will not assume from the very beginning that the relation between the number of scalars
and the dimensionality of the space-time (2.12) holds. after discussing some general
properties of the corresponding congurations, we concentrate on those cases where the
relation (2.12) holds, and therefore the solutions originate from gauged supergravity in
the appropriate number of dimensions. then, we lift our solutions to eleven or ten
dimensions in the context of eleven- or ten-dimensional supergravity. our analysis is
based on an analogous treatment of the case (d, n) = (5, 6) that was developed in
reference [11].

3.1 solutions in arbitrary dimensions

it is possible to nd the most general solution of the coupled system of equations (2.13).
as we have already mentioned, we will consider the potential arising from expression
(2.9) after using (2.12). we nd that

p =

g2

8  n 1

i(cid:19)2
xi=1 (cid:18)w

 2

d  1
d  2

w 2! .

(3.1)

unless otherwise specied, we will no longer restrict n and d to obey (2.12). the
resulting theory is that of n  1 scalars coupled to d-dimensional gravity with the
interaction potential (3.1). however, even though it no longer represents, for arbitrary
values of n and d, a sector of some gauged supergravity theory, it still admits interesting
solutions arising from the rst-order bogomolnyi equations (2.13).

in order to proceed further, we rst compute the evolution of the auxiliary scalar

elds i. using (2.3) and (2.13) we nd


i = 2

d  2
n

a +

g
2

e2i+a ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n ,

(3.2)

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to the argument z. it is easy to inte-
grate these n decoupled rst-order equations for the is. for further convenience we
reparametrize the function a(z) in terms of an auxiliary function f (zg2) as follows

ea = g(f )

n

4(d2)+n ,

(3.3)

where the prime denotes here derivative with respect to the argument zg2. the minus
sign we have included in this denition implies that, for consistency, the function f
should be monotonously decreasing with z. then, according to this ansatz we nd that
the general solution for the d-dimensional metric (2.7) is

ds2 = g2f

with

1

2(d2) dxdx + g2f  2

n df 2 ,

f =

n

yi=1

(f  bi) ,

6

(3.4)

(3.5)

and the solution for the scalar elds in (3.2) is given by

e2i =

f 1/n
f  bi

,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n .

the bis are n constants of integration, which can be ordered as

b1  b2  . . .  bn ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

without loss of generality. also, since the sum of the is is zero, we nd that the function
f has to satisfy the dierential equation

(f ) =

n

yi=1
(f  bi) = f ,

 =

4(d  2)n
4(d  2) + n

.

(3.8)

if we assume that our models arise from gauged supergravity, and therefore the rela-
tion (2.12) between the number of scalar elds n and the dimensionality of space-time
d holds, the metric (3.4) will become

ds2 = g2f

1

2(d2) dxdx + g2f  d3

2(d2) df 2 ,

(3.9)

whereas the scalar elds are still given by (3.6). the function f (zg2) is determined by
solving the equation

n

(f )4 =

yi=1
(f  bi) = f ,

(3.10)

since the constant  equals 4 in all three cases (d, n) = (4, 8), (5, 6) and (7, 5). although
the relation (2.12) guarantees that our models originate from gauged supergravity, it
should be emphasized that it is not the only possibility that results into an integer
value for . as an example, choosing d = 5 and n = 4 we obtain  = 3. another
interesting case, but with non-integer , arises for d = 3 and n = 2: it has  = 4/3
and describes three-dimensional gravity coupled to a single scalar in the presense of a
negative cosmological constant (since the potential (3.1) turns out to be constant).

so far, we have presented our general solution in a coordinate system where f is
viewed as the independent variable.2 if we insist on presenting the solution in a confor-
mally at form, as given by the rst line in (2.7), the dierential equation (3.8) needs to
be solved to obtain f (zg2). this will be studied in detail in section 5, using the theory
of algebraic curves and their uniformization, as it is a necessary step for investigating the
schrodinger equations that arise for the massless scalar and graviton uctuations.

if the constants bi are all equal, our solution becomes nothing but adsd (with radius
2(d  2)r/n) with all scalar elds turned o to zero. in the opposite case, when all
constants bi are dierent from one another, there is no continuous subgroup of so(n)
preserved by our solution. if we let some of the bis coincide, we restore various continuous

2to compare this with the results of [11] for the values d = 5 and n = 6, we should replace the

function f (z/r2) and the constants bi used in [11] by 4f (zg2) and 4bi, respectively.

7

subgroups of so(n) accordingly. imposing the reality condition on the scalars in (3.6)
restricts the values of f to be larger that the maximum of the constants bi; then, according
to the ordering in (3.7), this means that f  b1. for f  b1 the scalars tend to
zero and f  f n , in which case the metric in (2.7) approaches adsd (with radius
2(d  2)r/n) as expected. in the conformally at form of the metric, where z is viewed
as the independent variable, we have ea  1/z and therefore z = 0 is taken as the origin
of the z-coordinate. hence, in solving the dierential equation (3.10), we will choose the
constant of integration so that in the limit f  b1 we have the asymptotic behaviour
f  1/z4(d2)/n .3 for intermediate values of f we have a ow in the d-dimensional
space spanned by all scalar elds i. in general we may have b1 = b2 = . . . = bn, with
n  n, when b1 is n-fold degenerate.
in this case, the solution preserves an so(n)
subgroup of so(n) and the ow is actually taking place in n  n dimensions. on the
other hand, let us consider the case when f approaches its lower value b1. then, the
scalars in (3.6) are approaching

f 1/n

f 1/n
0
b1bi

i = 1, 2, . . . , n

(f  b1)(nn )/n ,

e2i 

where f0 = qn
i=n+1(b1  bi). consequently, we have a one-dimensional ow in this limit
since the scalar elds i can be expressed in terms of a single (canonically normalized)
scalar  as

when our solutions correspond to gauged supergravities and the relation (2.12) ap-
plies, it is also useful to nd the limiting form of the metric (3.9) when f  b1. changing

hence, at  = 0 (or equivalently at f = b1) there is a naked singularity that can be
interpreted, as we will see later in a higher-dimensional context, as the location of a
distribution of m5-, m2- or d3-branes for (d, n) = (7, 5), (4, 8) and (5, 6) respectively.
it will also be seen that this singularity is time-like for n = 1, 2, 3 and null for 4  n < n.
3using (3.6) we can show that the scalar elds go to zero as i  zd3, when (2.12) is obeyed. this
is consistent with the interpretation that these scalars parametrize states in the coulomb branch of the
n = 4 sym theory and they do not correspond to explicit mass deformations.

3.2 m-theory branes

it is possible to lift our seven- and four-dimensional solutions with metric and scalars
given by (3.9) and (3.6) with (d, n) = (7, 5) and (4, 8), respectively, to supersymmetric
solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity, where only the metric and the three-form
are turned on. the eleven-dimensional solutions will correspond to the gravitational
eld of a large number of m5-branes and m2-branes in the eld theory limit with a
special continuous distribution of branes in the transverse to the brane space. it shows
that they are true compactications of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s4 or s7,
respectively; this is also what is expected on general grounds [43]. the method we follow
is the same as that used in [11] to lift the ve-dimensional solution with (d, n) = (5, 6)
to a supersymmetric solution of the ten-dimensional type-iib supergravity representing
distributions of d3-branes in the eld theory limit. a brief summary of the main results
will also be included for completeness in this case.

in all cases h0 is a harmonic function in the n-dimensional space irn transverse to
the brane parametrized by the yi coordinates. however, instead of being asymptotically
at, the metrics (3.15)(3.17) will become asymptotically adsd  sn 1 for large radial
distances, with d and n taking their appropriate values. the radius of the sphere
is always r, whereas, in agreement with our previous normalization, it is 1
2(d  3)r
for adsd. under these conditions, the higher-dimensional solutions break half of the
maximum of 32 supersymmetries (see, for instance, [44]). it is only for coinciding branes,
when the metric is exactly adsd  sn 1, that the maximal number of supersymmetries
is preserved and the backgrounds are presumably exact vacua.

we proceed further by rst performing the coordinate change

yi = 2g(d5)/2(f  bi)1/2 xi ,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n ,

(3.18)

where the xis dene a unit n-sphere. it can be shown that the n-dimensional at metric

in both cases one makes the ansatz that the
solution does not depend on the sphere coordinates, i.e.  = eikx(z). since the solutions
for the scalar  should be the same in any consistent truncation of the theory, the
resulting second-order ordinary dierential equations should be identical. a comparison

note that the algebraic equation (3.21) for f cannot be solved analytically for general
choices of the constants bi. however, this becomes possible when some of the bis coincide
in such a way that the degree of the corresponding algebraic equations is reduced to 4 or
less. we also note that h0 as dened in (3.20) and (3.21) is indeed a harmonic function
in irn . the proof was made in [11] for the case n = 6, but even if n is kept general all
intermediate steps are essentially the same. we note that one may use as independent
variables, instead of the yis, spherical coordinates since the constraint (3.21) is then
automatically satised. for d3-branes, this was done for the various cases of interest in
[11]. for m2- and m5-branes we expect to recover the metrics found in [12]. various
subcases were also considered before in [5, 6, 8, 9] in connection with the coulomb branch
of gauge theories at strong coupling.

brane solutions that are asymptotically at are obtained by replacing h0 in (3.15)
(3.17) by h = 1 + h0. then, in this context, the length parameter r has a microscopic
interpretation using the eleven-dimensional planck scale lp or the string scale  and
the string coupling gs, and the (large) number of branes nb. for m5-branes we have
r3 = nbl3

p, and for d3-branes r4 = 4nbgs2.

4 the spectrum of uctuations

in this section we investigate the problem of solving the dierential equations that arise
for the massless scalar eld as well as for the graviton uctuations in our general d-
dimensional background metrics (3.9). after presenting some general features, we make
contact with supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which will prove useful for making
further progress in computing the exact spectrum later in sections 6, 7 and 8.

4.1 generalities

within the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] (assuming (2.12)), the solutions and eigen-
values of the massless scalar equation have been associated, on the gauge theory side,

10

with the spectrum of the operator trf 2, whereas those of the graviton uctuations po-
larized in the directions parallel to the brane, with the energy momentum tensor t
[45, 2, 3, 46]. a priori these two spectra are dierent. however, it can be shown, sim-
ilarly to the case of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity investigated in [36], that the
two spectra and the corresponding eigenfunctions coincide. hence, in what follows, 
will denote either a massless scalar eld or any component of the graviton tensor eld.

we proceed further by making the following ansatz for the solution

(x, z) = exp(ik  x) exp(cid:18)

d  2

2

a(cid:19) (z) ,

(4.1)

which represents plane waves propagating along the (d  2)-brane with an amplitude
function that is z-dependent. the mass-square is dened as m 2 = k  k. then the
equation for  can be cast into a time-independent schrodinger equation for a wave
function (z) as

with a potential given by

  + v  = m 2 ,

v =

(d  2)2

(4.2)

(4.3)

it should be noted and will be further discussed later in this section, that this potential
is of the form that appears in supersymmetric quantum mechanics and therefore the
spectrum is non-negative [47, 48].4 however, this does not guarantee that the massless
mode is normalizable. in our case, 0  exp((d  2)a/2) and it is clearly not square-
normalizable due to its behaviour near z = 0, namely 0  1/z(d2)/2. using the general
formulae (3.3) and (3.8) it turns out that the potential takes the form

v =

(4.4)

we note that in deriving (4.4) from (4.3) the relation (2.12) has not been used.

the expression (4.4) for the potential depends, of course, on the variable z through
the function f (zg2). even without any knowledge of the explicit z-dependence of the
potential, we may deduce some general properties about the spectrum in the various cases
of interest. in general, f takes values between the maximum of the constants bi (which
according to the ordering made in (3.7) is taken to be b1) and +. when f  + (or
equivalently z  0+), the space approaches adsd and the potential becomes

v 

d(d  2)

as

z  0+ ,

(4.5)

and hence it is unbounded from above. let us now consider the behaviour of the potential
close to the other end, namely when f  b1. consider the general case where b1 appears
4in the context of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity this has been rst hinted in [11] and explicitly

noted in [49].

11

n times, as in the corresponding discussion made at the end of subsection 3.1. using
(4.4) we nd that the potential behaves (including the subscript n to distinguish among
various cases) as

f 2/

vn 

4r4 (cid:0)(1 + 8/)n2  8n(cid:1) (f  b1)

as f  b1 ,

(4.6)

with f0 being a constant given, as before, by f0 = qi(b1  bi). hence, for  < n  n,

the potential goes to zero and the spectrum is continuous. for n =  the potential
approaches a constant value, which is given by v,min = 1
. therefore, although
the spectrum is continuous, it does not start from zero, but there is a mass gap whose
squared value is given by the minimum of the potential. hence, for   n  n the range
of z necessarily extends to +, i.e. 0  z < , with z =  corresponding to a null
naked singularity (except in the ads case where n = n). if  < n < n we have that
(f  b1)1n/  (n/  1)g2f 1/
z near f = b1, and therefore the potential behaves as

for n =  we have instead that f  b1  ef 1/n

the constant value that we have mentioned above. for n <  the potential goes to
either + or , as f  b1 and therefore the spectrum cannot be continuous but
discrete. therefore there should be a maximum value for z, denoted by zmax, that is
determined by solving the algebraic equation f (zmaxg2) = b1. the value of z = zmax
corresponds to a time-like naked singularity. then, using the relation (f  b1)1n/

(4.8)

one may worry that there are cases where the potential goes to  at z = zmax with
a coecient cn, that is smaller than 1/4; then, it is well known from elementary
quantum mechanics, that the spectrum might be unbounded from below. however,
this does not happen because we are dealing with supersymmetric quantum mechanics
and the spectrum is bounded from below by zero. in addition, the coecient cn, in
(4.8) is manifestly greater or equal than 1/4; the limiting value 1/4 is reached for
n = 4/( + 4). the qualitative analysis of the spectrum we just presented agrees with
that performed for (d, n) = (5, 6) in [11] and for (d, n) = (7, 5) and (d, n) = (4, 8) in
[12].

as we see later, solving the schrodinger equation (4.2) and determining the spectrum
is a non-trivial problem, except for a few particular cases where explicit calculations can

12

be carried out in detail. however, when the spectrum is discrete, as for n < , we
may use the approximate method of wkb. since the quantum mechanical potentials are
supersymmetric, wkb is expected to be an excellent approximation, not only for high
quantum numbers, but also for low ones [48]. moreover, if the potential turns out to be
shape-invariant, the wkb approximation is also exact [48]. it is convenient at this point
to use f as an independent variable instead of z. then, changing the dependent variable
in (4.2) as  = e(d2)a/2, we nd the equation

g4f f

1

4 + 1

 f  + m 2f

1

4  1

  = 0 .

(4.9)

using well-developed methods for studying this type of dierential equations (see, for
instance, [25]), the spectrum is found to be given approximately by

m 2

m =

z2

m(cid:18)m +

d  3

+ |(n/4  1) + n|

2(  n)

m = 1, 2, . . . ,

(4.10)

where, as usual, zmax is the maximum value of z and  is the constant dened in (3.8).
it turns out that the validity of the wkb approximation requires that the inequality
n <  be satised. this is also consistent with the fact that the potential should be
unbounded at the end points f = + and f = b1.

4.2 relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics

we have already mentioned that the potential (4.3) has the form encountered in super-
symmetric quantum mechanics [47, 48]. let us make this relationship more explicit by
rst recalling that in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, two potentials are supersym-
metric partners of one another provided that there is a superpotential w (z) so that

v1(z) = w 2  w  ,

v2(z) = w 2 + w  .

then, in terms of the ladder operators

a =

d
dz

+ w (z) ,

a = 

d
dz

+ w (z) ,

(4.11)

(4.12)

the eigenstates of the two hamiltonians h1, h2 are related to each other as

(2)

n =

a(1)

n+1 ,

(1)

n+1 =

1

qe(1)

n+1

a(2)
n

,

(4.13)

1

qe(2)

n

whereas for the energy levels, in the case that the spectra of the two partner potentials
are discrete, we have the relation

e(2)

n = e(1)

n+1 ,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,

(4.14)

0 = 0. notice that if (1)

with e(1)
n of h2
will be also normalized and vice-versa. thus, on general grounds, knowing the spectrum

n+1 of h1 is normalized then the wave-function (2)

13

of h1 one can construct the spectrum of h2; conversely, from the spectrum of h2 one can
deduce the spectrum of h1 apart from the ground state with e(1)
0 = 0 which is not paired.
this relation is true only for the case of unbroken supersymmetry. when supersymmetry
is broken, there is a 1-1 pairing of all eigenstates of h1 and h2 and the relations become
modied by replacing (1)
in the equations above. then,
the potentials v1 and v2 have degenerate positive ground state energies. we also recall
that when two partner potentials have continuum spectra the corresponding reection
and transmission probabilities are identical.

n+1 with e(1)

n+1 with (1)

the schrodinger potential (4.3) that arose in the study of quantum uctuations on

domain wall backgrounds has indeed the form v2(z) with superpotential

w (z) =

d  2

2

a(z) .

(4.15)

then, using (3.3) and (3.8) we nd that the partner potential v1(z) in (4.11) takes the
form

v1 =

(4.16)

which is analogous to the form (4.4) for v2. specic examples of this relation will be
considered in detail in later sections.

5 algebraic classication

the underlying mathematical structure for solving the dierential equation

(f (z))4 = (f (z)  b1)(f (z)  b2)   (f (z)  bn ) ,

(5.1)

with arbitrary moduli bi, is that of the christoelschwarz transformation in complex
analysis. this transformation is familiar from electrostatics, where one applies the tech-
nique to nd the electric potential for a given distribution of charges. from this point of
view, it is not surprising that the ansatz we made for constructing static domain walls
in theories of gauged supergravity amounts to solving a similar mathematical problem.
it is useful to think of the variable z as being complex, whereas f takes values in the
complex upper-half plane. of course, appropriate restrictions have to be made at the end
in order to ensure the reality of the variable z and hence the reality of our domain wall
solutions. as we will see in detail, the solutions are characterized by the uniformization
of riemann surfaces, which are naturally associated to the christoelschwarz transfor-
mation. hence, the explicit derivation of the schrodinger potential v (z) requires, for all
practical purposes, going through such a mathematical framework, apart from its own
value in providing a systematic classication of all domain-wall solutions in terms of alge-
braic curves. also note that the variable f is a function f (zg2), but for simplicity we set
g = 1 in the following; this parameter can be easily reinstated at the end by appropriate
scaling in z. here, we do not assume any particular ordering of bi.

14

we will treat the christoelschwarz transformation in a unied way for all three
cases of interest, namely (d, n) = (4, 8) (m2-branes), (d, n) = (5, 6) (d3-branes), and
(d, n) = (7, 5) (m5-branes), since there is a hierarchy of algebraic curves within this
transformation that depends on the isometry groups of the distributions of branes. it
is useful to start with n = 8 and consider an octagon in the complex z-plane, which is
mapped onto the upper-half plane via a christoelschwarz transformation

dz
df

= (f  b1)1/(f  b2)2/    (f  b8)8/ .

(5.2)

this transformation maps the vertices of the octagon to the points b1, b2,   , b8 on the
real axis of the complex f -plane, whereas its interior is mapped onto the entire upper-
half f -plane. the variables i denote the exterior (deection) angles of the octagon
at the corresponding vertices, which are constrained by geometry to satisfy the relation
1 + 2 +   + 8 = 2. we proceed by making the canonical choice of angles 1 = 2 =
   = 8 = /4, in which case we arrive at the dierential equation that relates dz and
df :

df(cid:19)4
(cid:18) dz

= (f  b1)1(f  b2)1    (f  b8)1 ,

which is the equation we have to solve for the case of m2-branes.

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

it is convenient at this point to introduce complex algebraic variables

x = f (z) ,

y = f (z) ,

which cast the above dierential equation into the form of an algebraic curve

y4 = (x  b1)(x  b2)   (x  b8) .

this denes a riemann surface of genus g = 9,5 when any two moduli are not equal,
as follows by direct application of the riemannhurwitz relation, which is standard in
algebraic geometry. the task now is to uniformize the algebraic curve by nding another
complex variable, call it u, so that x = x(u) and y = y(u), which resolves the problem
of multi-valuedness of the algebraic equation above; the corresponding riemann surface
is pictured geometrically by gluing four sheets together along their branch cuts. then,
following the denition of x and y in terms of f (z) and its z-derivative, one applies the
chain rule in order to obtain the function z(u) by integration of the resulting rst-order
equation

dz
du

=

1

dx(u)

y(u)

du

.

(5.6)

finally, by inverting the result we obtain the function u(z), which yields f (z), and
hence the conformal factor of the corresponding domain wall solutions, as well as the
schrodinger potential v (z) for the graviton and scalar eld uctuations in these back-
grounds. of course, there is an integration constant that appears in the function z(u),

5we will use the symbol g to denote the genus of a riemann surface. the fact that the same notation

has already been used for a mass scale should not create a confusion to the reader.

15

but this can be xed by requiring that the asymptotic behaviour of the domain walls
approach the ads geometry as z  0. we also note for completeness that there is a
discrete symmetry x  x, bi  bi that leaves invariant the form of the algebraic
curve. it can be employed in order to set f bigger or equal to the maximum value of
the moduli bi instead of being smaller or equal to the minimum value, thus insuring that
z  0 corresponds to f  + instead of .

the whole procedure is straightforward, but in practice it turns out to be cumbersome
when the moduli parameters bi take general values. after all, the uniformization of a
genus-9 riemann surface and the explicit derivation of the function u(z) is a formidable
task. matters simplify considerably when one imposes some isometry that eectively
reduces the genus of the algebraic curve as certain moduli are allowed to coalesce. in
general we will have models for each continuous subgroup of the maximal isometry group
so(8), in which case the algebraic curve takes the irreducible form

ym = (x  b1)a1(x  b2)a2    (x  bn)an ,

(5.7)

where the integer exponents (with n  8) satisfy the relation a1 + a2 +    an = 2m.
we present below in table 1 all riemann surfaces that classify the domain-wall solu-
tions of four-dimensional gauged supergravity with non-trivial scalar elds in the coset
sl(8, ir)/so(8) by giving their genus according to the riemannhurwitz relation, their
irreducible form (since in certain cases the exponents have common factors and the curve
might be reducible when written in its original form), as well as the corresponding isome-
try groups that determine the geometrical distribution of m2-branes in eleven dimensions.
we have 22 models in total, which are listed.

table 1: curves and symmetry groups of domain walls for m2-branes.

we will see later that, for the models with low genus (0 or 1), the uniformization can
be carried out in all detail and it is possible in many cases to arrive at explicit expressions
for the exact form of the schrodinger potential.

it is interesting to note that the classication of domain walls of ve-dimensional
gauged supergravity with non-trivial scalar elds in the coset sl(6, ir)/so(6) follows
immediately from above by restricting our attention to models with an so(2) isometry
factor in the symmetry group. it is known that in this case the classication reduces to
the list of all algebraic curves [11]

y4 = (x  b1)(x  b2)   (x  b6) ,

(5.8)

depending on the values of the six moduli bi. but such curves can be viewed as special
cases of the n = 8 curves when b7 = b8 = . therefore, by comparison with table 1 we
list in table 2 all domain walls of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity, which correspond
to various continuous distributions of d3-branes in ten dimensions. we have 11 models
in total, which are listed.

finally, the algebraic classication of all domain-wall solutions of seven-dimensional
gauged supergravity with non-trivial scalar elds in the coset sl(5, ir)/so(5) (which by
the way provides the full scalar sector in this case) follows by considering all riemann
surfaces of the form

y4 = (x  b1)(x  b2)   (x  b5) ,

(5.9)

for various values of the ve moduli bi. as before, these surfaces can be viewed as special
cases of the n = 8 algebraic curves where three of the moduli are taken to innity,
i.e. b6 = b7 = b8 = , whereas the remaining are free to vary. put dierently, we may
compose the list of all domain walls that correspond to various continuous distributions of
m5-branes in eleven dimensions by considering all n = 8 models with a so(3) isometry
factor. thus, we have 7 models in total, which are listed.

6 distributions of m2-branes

in this section we treat the distributions of m2-branes with isometries that correspond
to genus 0 and 1 and present the uniformization of the associated algebraic curves. we
have 12 such models of low genus, including the so(8) model of ads4 space. when it
is possible, we determine the conformal factor of the metrics (written in conformally at
form), as well as the schrodinger potentials corresponding to the equation for the scalar
eld and graviton uctuations. there are several cases where we can explicitly solve the
schrodinger equation and nd the spectrum by means of elementary methods, otherwise
we will use the wkb approximation for the computations.

we begin rst with the model so(2)  so(2)  so(2)  so(2), which is governed
by a g = 1 algebraic curve, and study certain limits for which some of the moduli are
let to coincide and the genus is reduced to 0. these cases are so(4)  so(2)  so(2),
so(4)  so(4) and so(6)  so(2) as well as the trivial so(8) model. we also present
other g = 0 models, which cannot be obtained as degenerate limits of the above, namely
the models with symmetry group so(7) and so(3)  so(5). for completeness we also
present the uniformization of the remaining g = 1 cases, as well as the remaining g = 0
model with symmetry so(3) so(4), which unfortunately cannot be explicitly brought
to a conformally at frame by expressing their uniformizing parameter as a function of
z, u(z), in closed form.

y = y x2/(2p123) ,

x = 1/x ,

(6.2)

we obtain

y 2 = 4(x + 1)(x + 3)(x + 3) .

finally, we can bring the curve to its weierstrass form

w2 = 4v3  g2v  g3 ,

(6.3)

(6.4)

by letting x = v  (1 + 2 + 3)/3, y = w. the coecients turn out to be

(6.7)

here e1, e2 and e3 are the values of the weierstrass function at the half-periods, i.e.
(1) = e1, (2) = e3 and (1 + 2) = e2, which are expressed in terms of the
parameters i as

(1 + 2 + 3) ,

the constant c in (6.12) was chosen in such a way that e2a  1/z2 as z  0 and the
space becomes ads4. also, according to the conventions followed in this paper we choose
the branch (c) < 0, since c is otherwise determined up to a sign; then, the function f
in (6.9) indeed approaches + as z  0. using the equation for c and certain identities
involving the weierstrass function, the conformal factor can be brought to the form

e2a =

((u  c)  (u + c)) .

(6.14)

6throught the rest of the paper we will make use of elliptic functions as well as of other special

functions following the conventions of [50, 51, 52].

v (z) =

(2(u + c) + 2(u  c)  (2u)) .

(6.15)

the structure of the spectrum is understood using the results of section 4. for generic
non-identical values of i the spectrum is discrete and the range of 0  z  zmax is nite,
where zmax is found by solving the equation f (zmaxg2) = 1/1. we nd, in particular,
that

2123

zmax =

g2

(1  c) ,

(6.16)

where 1 and c are given by (6.6) and (6.12). then, using (4.10) with d = 4,  = 4 and
n = 2, we determine the spectrum within the wkb approximation

(6.17)

note that the model we have just considered corresponds to the supersymmetric
(extremal) limit of the most general rotating m2-brane solution [24] of eleven-dimensional
supergravity. physically, the parameters bi are set equal (up to a factor) to the four
dierent rotational parameters that appear in that general solution, and therefore are
naturally associated to the cartan subgroup of so(8). this identication is analogous
to the model of a d3-brane distribution with so(2)  so(2)  so(2) isometry, which
corresponds to the supersymmetric limit of the most general rotating d3-brane solution
[25] of type-iib supergravity, as shown in [11].

we will return again to this model in section 8, together with other potentials that
arise in elliptic solutions of gauged supergravities, and apply the rules of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics to simplify the calculation of the exact spectrum. it will turn out that
the partner potential is formulated as a lame problem with half-integer characteristic
n = 1/2.

(6.19)

which can be easily integrated by elementary functions; the nal result depends on the
sign of (b1  b3)(b2  b3).

21

alternatively, the result can be obtained as the limit 1 = 2 of the so(2) so(2)
so(2)  so(2) model. using some limiting properties of the weierstrass functions, we
nd that the conformal factor is

the spectrum is continuous (according to the ordering of our parameters 1 = 2 < 3),
and 0  z < . this example corresponds to n = 4, which we have already discussed
on general grounds in section 4. hence, there is a nite mass gap given by the value of
the potential at z = . we nd, in particular, that

alternatively, one may consider the limit 2 = 3 of the model with so(2) so(2)

it turns out that the result is equivalently described by
considering the analytic continuation of (6.21) and (6.25) by taking 3 < 1. then, the

the exact solution: it might seem hard to nd the explicit solution of the schrodinger
equation with potentials (6.21) and (6.25). however, we will show that the explicit
solution can be readily obtained by applying techniques of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics, thus going beyond the wkb approximation. we consider for simplicity only
the case when the spectrum is discrete and the potential is given by (6.25). it turns out
that the partner potential to (6.25) is given by

(6.29)

using the notation of section 4, where u is given by (6.26). if we change variables for the

where m = 1, 2, . . .. finally, by employing (6.31), we nd that the mass spectrum is given
by

one may easily check that it coincides with the wkb result (6.28) (after setting
1 = 23), which is also exact in this case. the situation is similar to the distribution of

23

d3-branes with so(2)  so(4) symmetry for which the exact spectrum [8, 9] coincides
with what has been found using the wkb approximation [25]. this is a characteristic
property of shape-invariant potentials [48]. we also note presently that the solution
(6.32) can be expressed in terms of jacobi polynomials as

for the generic case, where the constant parameters 1 and 3 satisfy the condition
1 > 3, but otherwise they remain unrelated, one may solve (6.33) in the asymptotic
regime of large . using the fact that for large

to leading order by the solutions of the simple trigonometric equation sin  = 0.
follows easily that the result agrees with the leading term in the wkb formulae (6.28).

finally, note that the wave-functions (2)

(4.13), where for the lowering operator (4.12) we have w (z) = a(z) with a(z) given by

this model is described by an algebraic curve with g = 0 and can easily be obtained by
taking the limit 3   in the above expressions. we nd that the conformal factor for

in this case we have 0  z < , and the spectrum is continuous with a mass gap

(6.40)

(6.41)

alternatively, the same result is obtained by direct uniformization of the irreducible
genus 0 curve, y = (x  b1)(x  b2) (see table 1). letting v = y/(x  b1), w = x  b2, we
arrive at the standard form v = w, which is uniformized by a complex parameter u as

x = u + b2 ,

y = u(u + b2  b1)

and so the nal result reads

z(u) =

1

b2  b1

ln(cid:18)

u

u + b2  b1(cid:19) ;

u(z) =

b1  b2

choosing the integration constant to be zero. then, we have

(6.42)

(6.43)

(6.44)

which is equivalent to the expression for the conformal factor above, after introducing
the appropriate scale.

in this model we can also determine the eigenfunctions exactly. it turns out that the
wave-functions are expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions, using a characteristic
parameter q 6= 0, as

(6.46)

with constant coecients c1 and c2. a solution valid for q = 0 can also be written down
following [50, 51], but it will not be needed for the present purposes. because of the mass
gap (6.41), the parameter q is purely imaginary. this provides an orthonormalizability
in the dirac sense (with the use of a -function), since the solution (6.45) becomes an
incoming and an outgoing plane wave for z  . on the other hand, examining the
behaviour of (6.45) near z = 0, we require the coecient of the most singular term to
vanish. it yields the following condition,

(6.47)

note that the supersymmetric partner of the potential (6.40) is just a constant (given
) and therefore, according to the results of supersymmetric quantum me-

by v1 = 4

chanics, the potential (6.40) is reectionless [48].

for b1 < b2 we have 0  z <  and the spectrum is continuous with no gap, which is in
agreement with our general discussion. otherwise, for b2 < b1, we nd 0  z  zmax =

we nd within the wkb approximation that the spectrum is

note for completeness that (6.51) and (6.52) can also be obtained from (6.20) and (6.21)
and from (6.24) and (6.25) by simply taking the limit 3  1.

finally, let us mention that the wave-functions and the spectrum can be determined
exactly using, as before, techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the same
is true for the other two cases that will be discussed in subsections 6.5 and 6.6 below.
since there are certain similarities in all three cases of interest, we choose to present
their analysis based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics all together, and uniformly,
in subsection 6.7.

6.7 some exact results

we are in a position to apply techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, as in
subsection 6.2 above, in order to nd the explicit solution of the schrodinger equation
with potentials (6.52), (6.58) and (6.64) and determine the associated spectra in a uniform
way; all three quantum mechanical problems will be treated at once.

first consider the case where the spectrum is discrete. let us change the variable to
x, z = zmaxx, where zmax is dened as in the appropriate subsections and 0  x  zmax.
then, by the rules of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the partner potential to our
problem is given by

v1(x) =

2  1/4

x2

,

(6.66)

where  = 1, 2,2/3 for the three models that correspond to so(2)  so(6), so(3) 
so(5) and so(7), respectively. both signs 2/3 were chosen for the so(7) model for
reasons that will be indicated towards the end of this subsection. the solution of the
schrodinger equation which is regular at x = 0 (for  = 1, 2, 2/3) is given in terms of
bessel functions as

(1)  x1/2j(mx) .

28

(6.67)

for  = 2/3 the wave-function diverges at x = 0, but it is not strong enough to make
it non-integrable.7 imposing the condition that the wave-function vanishes at x = zmax,
which also ensures the hermiticity of the hamiltonian, we nd the mass spectrum in
terms of the zeros of the bessel function,

j(mmzmax) = 0 ,

then, the states in (6.67), which correspond to the dierent solutions of (6.68), constitute
a complete set of states. the undetermined overall constant in (6.67) can be found, as
m = n,m and

usual, by demanding the orthonormalizability condition r zmax

note that the conditions (6.68) and  > 1 are crucial for the validity of this equation.
an asymptotic expression for the eigenvalues mm can be found, which is valid for
large values of the argument mmzmax of j. using standard formulae from the theory of
bessel functions we arrive at the result

(6.70)

for  = 1 and  = 2, it agrees with the wkb formulae (6.53) and (6.59). however, the
wkb formula (6.65) is reproduced for the value  = 2/3 (by rst shifting m by one
unit) instead of  = 2/3. actually, for  = 2/3, we obtain (6.65) with the number 5/6
replaced by 1/6. this ambiguity in the spectrum remains unresolved even for the partner
wave-functions (2) that we are interested in computing afterall; these are obtained using
(4.13), where for the lowering operator in (4.12) we have w (z) = a(z), with a(z) given
by (6.51), (6.57) and (6.63) for all three dierent cases respectively.

we nd, in particular, for the wave-functions that

it is crucial to note here that for all three type of wave-functions above, (1)
m vanish
at the end point x = zmax. this can be shown by rst expanding the wave-function

7 in fact, the general criteria developed in [53] render the propagation of quantum test particles in
such a space-time geometry as unphysical, and hence should be related to unphysical vacuum expectation
values of the scalar elds. indeed, it was shown in [12] that, in this case, the density of the m2-brane
distribution has a negative component which is physically unacceptable.

around x = zmax, using properties of the bessel functions, and then observe that the
coecient of the divergent part in the expansion is proportional to j(mmzmax), and
hence vanishes due to (6.68); the constant part vanishes identically. note also that the
asymptotic behaviour of the wave-function near x = 0 is (1)
m  x1/6 for both  = 2/3
and  = 2/3. hence, there is a priori no reason to dismiss either one of the two values
 = 2/3 or  = 2/3. it remains unclear to us, at least for the moment being, what is the
extra condition one should impose in order to exclude one of these two values. as soon
as this becomes possible, the spectrum corresponding to the distribution of m2-branes
with so(7) symmetry will be determined unambiguously in the discrete case.

considering the same potentials (6.52), (6.58) and (6.64), but for continuous spec-
trum, we nd in all three cases that the parameter zmax becomes negative. by changing
variable to x, where z = x  |zmax|, we note that the appropriate partner potential is
still given by (6.66), but with |zmax|  x < . since the point x = 0 is not contained in
the range of x we should admit both independent solutions of the corresponding bessel
equation, namely j and n, following the standard nonmenclature. demanding that the
wave-functions vanish at the endpoint x = |zmax|, determines their relative coecient.
hence, the wave-function is given by

(1)  n(m|zmax|)j(mx)  j(m|zmax|)n(mx) ,

(6.72)

whereas the spectrum is continuous with no mass gap.

6.8 so(3)  so(4)

last, but not least, we consider the remaining curve of genus 0

y4 = (x  b1)(x  b2)3(x  b3)4 ,

which can be brought to the unicursal form using the birational transformation

and hence uniformized by setting u = v = w. assuming for deniteness that b1 6= b2, we
may proceed to solve the dierential equation (5.6) in order to obtain the corresponding
function z(u). taking the limits b1  b3 or b2  b3 yields the models so(3)  so(5)
and so(7) respectively, which we have already discussed. for general bis we arrive at

a unifying way. these cases are

although case (i) corresponds to taking c = d, there is no smooth limit of (ii) that yields
the expression (i). in the case (iii) above we have v+ = v, and so the derivation has to
be performed separately without taking (ii) in the limit b = d.

it is rather unfortunate that we can not invert the relations and nd u(z) in closed
form for these models, apart from the case (iv). hence, they will not be discussed any
more. we only leave case (iv) as an exercise for the interested reader to explore it further.

7 distributions of m5-branes

in this section we treat the distributions of m5-branes with isometries that correspond
to genus 1 and 0 and present the uniformization of the associated algebraic curves in
as much the same way as for the m2-branes. there are only two models to consider
apart from the ads7 space, namely the distribution with isometry group so(2) so(3)
that corresponds to a genus 1 algebraic curve, and that with isometry group so(4)
corresponding to a genus 0 algebraic curve. unfortunately there is no case where we
could nd the exact spectrum in terms of known functions and therefore we will only
resort to the wkb approximation for the computations.

7.1 so(2)  so(3)

where c is an integration constant (to be xed by the asymptotic conditions). then,
using (3.3), we nd the conformal factor

e2a = g2f (zg2)

5 .

(7.6)

note that the two half-periods of the torus 1, 2 can be computed using (6.6) and
the fact that in our model the modulus and its complement are equal to each other,
k = k = 1/2, since g3 = 0. we have

1 = i2 =

(1/4)2

22(a  b)1/4

.

(7.7)

hence, for a > b, 1 is real and 2 is purely imaginary, whereas for a < b they are complex
conjugate of each other. the constant of integration c is determined by requiring that

33

the space becomes ads7 for z  0. we nd, in particular, that c = 1 + 2, which is
complex (or real) if a > b (or a < b).

we also nd the following schrodinger potential, using the rescaling factor g = 2/r,

1

v (z) =

r4 (cid:20)35(cid:18) 2z

r2(cid:19) + 3(cid:18) 2z

r2 + 1 + 2(cid:19)  (cid:18) 2z

r2 + 1(cid:19)  (cid:18) 2z
note that 0  z < zmax, where zmax = r2
2 (1 + 2) if a < b and zmax = r2
the spectrum is discrete and, within the wkb approximation, it is given by
163b  a
(1/4)4r4 m(m + 3) + o(m0) ,
323a  b
(1/4)4r4 m(m + 2) + o(m0) ,

m = 1, 2, . . . ,

(7.9)

m = 1, 2, . . . , (7.10)

where (4.10) has been used with d = 7,  = 4 and n = 3 (or n = 2) for a < b (or
a > b). we will see later, in the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics, that the
partner potential is related to the potential of the so(3) so(3) model of d3-branes in
ve dimensions.

7.2 so(4)

parameter u, as v = w = u. consequently, we arrive at

which yields upon integration the following cases:

34

apart from the maximally symmetric model that corresponds to a = b, these relations
cannot be inverted to yield u(z) in closed form.

the nature of the spectrum depends crucially on the sign of a  b. using our general
formulae we nd that for a < b we have 0  z <  and that the spectrum is continuous
with a mass gap given by

a < b :

m 2

(7.15)

for a > b we have 0  z  zmax = 2/g2(a  b)1/4 and the spectrum is discrete. it is

a > b :

m =

m = 1, 2, . . . .

(7.16)

finally we would like to mention the relation of the models we have presented in
this section to the most general solution of rotating m5-brane [26] of eleven-dimensional
supergravity. the latter, besides the usual poincare invariance along the brane, has also
an so(2)  so(2) symmetry group corresponding to the cartan subgroup of so(5).
hence, in the extremal limit it will correspond to a supersymmetric solution associated
with an algebraic curve of genus 2, as can be seen from the appropriate entry in table
3. the two independent parameters in the equation of the algebraic curve are related
to the rotational parameters of this rotating m5-brane solution. the genus 1 model
with symmetry so(2)  so(3) corresponds to the particular limit when one rotational
parameter is set equal to zero. the case with a < b corresponds to the rotating solution
with lorentzian signature, whereas for a > b it corresponds to the same solution, but
with the time and angular parameters analytically continued so that the metric remains
real but its signature becomes euclidean. the associated spectra are given in the wkb
approximation by (7.9) and (7.10).8 the genus 0 model with symmetry group so(4)
corresponds to letting the two angular parameters become equal. we note that this is not
equivalent to setting one of them zero and keeping the other nite. then, a < b describes
the euclidean solution, whereas a > b describes the lorentzian. the corresponding
spectra are described by (7.15) and (7.16) respectively.

7.3 wilson surfaces

we would like to calculate the vacuum expectation values of wilson surface operators
in the six-dimensional (0, 2) theories on the coulomb branch. it was shown in [55] that
the ads/cft correspondence could be used to compute wilson surface observables [56]
of (0, 2) theories in the limit of a large number nb of m5-branes. the wilson area
operator in the supergravity picture is dened by requiring that a membrane ends at

8in fact (7.10) coincides with the supersymmetric limit of the wkb formula given in [54] for the
masses of 0++ glueballs using rotating m5-branes with one rotational parameter, in a supergravity
approach to qcd4 [2].

35

the boundary of ads7  s4 on the surface that denes the operator. we will consider
wilson surfaces corresponding to a pair of parallel strings on the boundary using the
prescription of [55] in the special backgrounds constructed in sections 3.1, 7.1 and 7.2.
wilson loops turned out to be useful tools for learning about the physics of gauge theories
in the study of supergravity duals of four-dimensional theories on the coulomb branch.
it is interesting that complete screening was found with an associated screening length
suppressed by 1/gsnb compared to what is expected from eld theory considerations
at weak coupling [8, 9].

in the conformal limit, this calculation was performed in [55] leading to the result

e = 

8(cid:0) 2
3(cid:1)3
6(cid:1)3
(cid:0) 1

nb
l2 ,

(7.17)

where e denotes the energy per unit length or tension between the innitely long strings
as function of their separation l. this can easily be generalized to backgrounds of the
form (3.15), (3.18)-(3.20) with f dened as in equation (3.5). we will impose the minor
restriction b1 = . . . = bn = b and bn+1 = . . . = b5 = 0, thus breaking the so(5) symmetry
to so(n)  so(5 n). furthermore, we choose the orientation of the wilson surface on
the deformed s4 to be constant and to lie in the subspace spanned by yn+1, . . . , y5 (see
also (3.18)).

minimizing the membrane action in these backgrounds with the orientation chosen

as above, yields the following integrals for the length and the energy (for 1  n  4)

(7.18)

(7.19)

(7.20)

with f0  b being the minimal value of f that the wilson surface reaches. in general these
integrals cannot be expressed in terms of known functions and so we will only present here
some numerical results. for f  b, or equivalently for small separations l  r2/ 4b,

the behaviour of the potential is as in (7.17) and goes to zero faster for larger separations.
from a certain distance l > lmax, and further on, there does not exist a minimal surface
connecting the two strings on the boundary. instead, a conguration of two separated
surfaces hanging straight into the interior of the geometry is energetically preferred. this
means that the potential is screened for large separation; a phenomenon that was also
observed in four-dimensional superconformal theories on the coulomb branch [8, 9]. the
maximal distance at which the string breaks can be determined numerically

lmax = cn

r2
4b

(7.21)

with c1  0.71 , c2  0.69 , c3  0.70 and c4  0.78. for n = 1, 2, 3 the length reaches
its maximum lmax at f0 > b and becomes zero as f0  b. at l = lmax the energy

36

is larger than zero and the split conguration is preferred. for n = 4, lmax is reached
exactly when f0  b; at this point the potential tends smoothly to zero and will remain
there even if the separation is increased. this is the phenomenon of complete screening
that was also found in the context of some special continuous distributions of d3-branes
in [8, 9]. this phenomenon occurs in cases where the mass spectrum is continuous with
a mass gap.

8 comments on lame equations

in this section we summarize some results on the lame equation, and its various gener-
alizations, which arise in the study of quantum uctuations for the scalar and graviton
elds in the background of domain walls associated to elliptic functions. we have already
seen that in many cases the schrodinger potential has the common form

v (u) = (+1)(u)+(+1)(u+1)+(+1)(u+1+2)+(+1)(u+2) , (8.1)

for various choices of the coecients , ,  and ; they are all constrained to satisfy the
hermiticity bound  1/2. we have found, in particular, the following list of examples:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

d3branes with so(2)  so(2)  so(2) :

 =

.

the rst two cases were derived in [11], where emphasis was placed on analyzing domain
wall solutions of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity.9 there, the expressions for the
conformal factor were found to be

e2a(z) =(cid:18)(u)

2r3 (cid:19)2/3

and (cid:18) (u)

4r(u)(cid:19)2

,

(8.2)

with u = z/r2 and u = z/(2r2), respectively. the third example was discussed here in
section 7.1, and has u = 2z/r2. the parameter u assumes real values from 0 to 1 (real
semi-period) for the cases (i), (ii) and (iii) (with a > b), whereas for the case (iii) (with
a < b) u takes real values from 0 to 1 + 2. in the context of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics [48] the potential (i) is mapped to a potential with coecients  = 1/2,
 =  =  = 0, which is simpler to study. the potentials (ii) and (iii) (with a > b) also
turn out to be related to each other via supersymmetric quantum mechanics, and the
details are worth exposing.

9actually, for the so(3)  so(3) model of d3-branes, the schrodinger potential was originally pre-
sented in another form in [11], but that is equivalent to the potential (ii) because of special identities of
the underlying riemann surface with g3 = 0.

37

more precisely, we nd that the supersymmetric partner potentials corresponding to

the so(2)  so(2)  so(2) model in d = 5 are given respectively by the pair

v1(u) = 3(2u) ,

v2(u) = 4(u)  (2u) ,

(8.3)

making use of the identity

2(u)(cid:19)2
(2u) = 2(u) +(cid:18) (u)

=

1
4

((u) + (u + 1) + (u + 2) + (u + 1 + 2)) .

(8.4)

so, by rescaling u by a factor of 2, setting u = 2u, we obtain a partner schrodinger
problem in u with potential v1(u) = ( + 1)(u) having  = 1/2 as advertised. for
later use we drop the tilde and still use the variable u, but with a range from 0 to 21.
according to the previous general discussion, the ground state energy of h1 is expected
to be zero, which will also be encountered later using a direct approach.

the schrodinger potentials appearing in the examples (ii) and (iii) (with a > b) also
have supersymmetric partners within the same class. we nd, in particular, that the
supersymmetric partner potential of the model (ii) has  =  = 1/2,  =  = 3/2,
whereas a similar analysis for the model (iii) yields a potential with  =  = 3/2,
 =  = 1/2. we do not observe important simplications occuring in the form of the
potential in any of the two cases. an interesting observation is that the supersymmetric
partner of the potential (iii) is (ii), and we believe that there is a deeper reason for this
nding. note at this point that, generically, any two supersymmetric partner potentials
are related to each other by simply changing sign in the superpotential w  w . for
domain wall solutions this would mean that the conformal factor reverses, since a  a,
and so this transformation could only be of mathematical interest in relating dierent
spectra. in physical terms, the transformation w  w cannot be used to map one
domain wall solution to another because it fails to preserve the ads boundary condition
imposed on the conformal factor for z  0. however, it may happen in certain cases (as
above) that there are two dierent superpotentials with the correct asymptotic behaviour
as z  0 which yield the same supersymmetric partners; indeed, the potential (ii) is the
v1 partner of a potential v2 given by the model (iii), due to special identities on riemann
surfaces with g3 = 0, but conversely this is not so because w  w does not relate the
model (ii) and (iii).

another notable relation concerns the supersymmetric partner of the elliptic potential
for the so(2) so(2) so(2) so(2) model of m2-branes in four-dimensional gauged
supergravity. actually, in this case we nd that the two partner potentials

v1 = 3(2u) ,

v2 = 2(u + c) + 2(u  c)  (2u)

(8.5)

are connected by supersymmetry, and so by reinstating the overall scaling factor and
constant shift that relates the uniformizing parameter to the schrodinger variable (now

38

called u), we obtain again the lame potential with  = 1/2 but in the range from 2c
to 21. this concludes the presentation of some qualitative results on the schrodinger
equation of quantum uctuations on elliptic backgrounds.

an interesting problem that remains unsolved is the exact evaluation of the full spec-
trum of the schrodinger equation in this class of potentials. so far we have relied on
semi-classical approximation methods to get a feeling about the spectrum and the exis-
tence of a mass gap. unfortunately, the exact result is very hard to nd, even in some
simple cases, and involves transcendental equations in rather implicit form. nevertheless,
it is quite instructive to highlight some special results in order to appreciate the degree
of diculty one faces in the general case. we note that the family of potentials under
investigation are indeed a natural generalization of lames potential n(n + 1)(u) by
adding terms located at all four corners of the parallelogram u, u + 1, u + 2, u + 1 + 2
in the complex domain of a genus 1 riemann surface. the lame potential was originally
introduced in order to describe the analogue of spherical harmonics for the solutions of
the laplace equation in three dimensions with ellipsoidal symmetry. as such, n can only
take (positive) integer values. however, generalizations were also considered, more than
a century ago, for half-integer and other values of the parameter n. the main results
in this direction go back to hermite, brioschi and halphen (see, for instance, [57] and
[58]), but also darboux apparently studied some aspects of the general potential (8.1) in
its jacobi form. half-integer values of the coecients are particularly interesting for the
examples we have at hand, but we will be able to say something explicit only for the case
 = 1/2 and  =  =  = 0, which is related to the so(2)  so(2)  so(2) model of
ve-dimensional gauged supergravity or to the so(2)  so(2)  so(2)  so(2) model
in four dimensions.

we proceed by considering the lame equation

(cid:18)

d2

du2 + n(n + 1)(u)(cid:19) (u) = e(u) ,

(8.6)

where e are the energy levels of the corresponding one-dimensional quantum mechanical
problem and (u) are normalized wave functions that vanish (typically) at u = 0 modulo
the real period 21. of course, when n is a positive integer, the solutions are easily
described using appropriate ratios of the weierstrass sigma-function, namely

1(u) = eu (u  1)(u  2)   (u  n)

n(u)

,

2(u) = eu (u + 1)(u + 2)   (u + n)

n(u)

,

(8.7)

where the constants  and i are determined by substituting the ansatz into lames
equation. using these two (in general independent) solutions one can construct regular
solutions by taking suitable linear combinations of them and obtain a transcendental
equation for the energy eigenvalues.

on the other hand, if n is not an integer the solutions will be dicult to describe,
even in a formal sense. some simplications occur when n is half of an odd positive

39

integer. it is known in this case, using the substitution

 = ((z))n (z) ,

where z = u/2 ,

that lames equation transforms into the dierential equation

d2
dz2  2n

(z)
(z)

d
dz

+ 4 (n(2n  1)(z) + e)  = 0 .

(8.8)

(8.9)

then, according to results obtained by brioschi and halphen more than a century ago,
a formal solution can be written as

provided that

(z) =



xr=0

cr ((z)  e2)ar ,

(a  2n)(a  n + 1/2) = 0 ,

(8.10)

(8.11)

and that the following recursive relations are satised:

(ar2n)(arn+1/2)cr+(3e2(a  r + 1)(a  r  2n + 1) + e2n(2n  1) + e) cr1

= (e1  e2)(e2  e3)(a  r + 2)(a  r  n + 3/2)cr2 .

(8.12)

here, e1, e2 and e3 denote the three roots of the cubic curve in its weierstrass form.
actually, when n is half of an odd positive integer, there is a solution expressible in nite
form

n1/2

(z) =

cr ((z)  e2)2nr ,

(8.13)

xr=0

which corresponds to a = 2n, and provides discrete energy levels e by solving the
recursive relations with cn+1/2 = 0; they are all real for curves having real roots ei.
otherwise, for solutions expressible as an innite sum, the energy levels remain arbitrary
by these general considerations alone.

the simplest case to consider has n = 1/2. it turns out that a solution expressible in

nite form has only one term:

(z) = c0 ((z)  e2) ,

(8.14)

with energy e = 0 and c0 arbitrary. this yields one of the two independent solutions
of lames equation with zero energy, call it 1(u), whereas the other is obtained by
employing the general formula that relates any two solutions with the same energy e:

2(u) = c1(u)z

du
2(u)

1

,

(8.15)

where c is another constant. an explicit calculation shows that the most general solution
with e = 0 is given in terms of two integration constants a, b by

(u) =

(a(u/2) + b) .

(8.16)

1

p(u/2)

40

having established this, one may impose the regularity of the physical solution at u = 0,
namely (0) = 0, and set the coecient a = 0; otherwise the wave function will diverge

as 1/u for u  0. for u = 21, however, the wave-function blows up and hence it is

not normalized.

for n = 1/2, but with e 6= 0, the formal solution has an innite number of terms.
according to the general discussion, we nd after some calculation (working with either
a = 0 or a = 1) the result

(z) = c  1

e

where c is an arbitrary constant and

and so on. unfortunately, even in this simplest case with n = 1/2, it is very dicult to
solve the recursive relations and nd all coecients dk in closed form in order to sum
up the innite series of terms. in any case, this procedure yields one formal solution of
lames equation with e 6= 0, 1(u), whereas the other (independent) formal solution
of the same energy, 2(u), can be obtained according to the general formula above.
however, the integration that determines 2(u) in terms of 1(u) cannot be performed
explicitly unless one knows rst how to sum up the innite series of terms for (z).

note that for n = 1/2 the formal solution 1(u) appears to be regular at u = 0,
whereas at u = 21 (where (u/2) = e1) this is not guaranteed.
in fact, since the
coecients dk are polynomial functions of the energy e, one must demand that the
resulting energy series converge. since (1) = 0, we demand i.e.

1
e

+



xk=1

dk(e)

(e1  e2)k = 0 .

(8.19)

this is certainly a non-trivial constraint on the allowed energy bands when e 6= 0, which
also depend on the relative size of the a- and b-cycles of the riemann surface, i.e. the
dierences e2 e3 and e2 e1 that appear in the energy sum. however, we are not able
at present to nd the complete solution to the problem in closed (even transcendental)
form.

9 conclusions

we have investigated in detail the structure of domain wall solutions in theories of gauged
supergravity in diverse dimensions by considering the eect of non-trivial scalar elds tak-

41

ing values in the coset space sl(n, ir)/so(n). the presentation was kept quite general
to cover, where possible, aspects of domain wall solutions in theories of d-dimensional
gravity by turning o the eect of any other elds, such as gauge elds and fermions.
special emphasis has been placed on two cases, namely (d, n) = (4, 8) and (7, 5), which
arise by compactication of eleven-dimensional supergravity on s7 and s4 respectively.
the eect of the scalar elds in four (or seven) dimensions is related to deformations of
the round spheres in the compactifying space, thus breaking the isometry group so(8)
(or so(5)) into appropriate symmetry subgroups. in fact, we were able to give an alge-
braic classication of all such cases using the christoelschwarz transformation, which
arises in the solution of the rst-order bogomolnyi-type equations for the conformal fac-
tor and the scalar elds of these models. as a result, for d = 4, we found a hierarchy
of 22 solutions starting from an algebraic curve of genus 9 corresponding to completely
broken isometry group. when some cycles shrink to zero size, by letting some moduli
coalesce, the symmetry group is enhanced, whereas the genus of the riemann surface is
lowered accordingly. among the genus 0 models there is the ads4 space with no scalar
elds, having maximal isometry group so(8), while in all other cases ads4 is reached
only asymptotically. similarly, for d = 7, we found 7 models in total, which can be
classied starting from a genus 6 algebraic curve with no isometry and proceeding all the
way down to genus 0, where the ads7 space arises with maximal isometry group so(5).
all other models in the list admit subgroups of so(5) as isometries and approach ads7
only asymptotically due to the presence of non-trivial scalar elds.

a geometrical picture of our solutions in four and seven dimensions is provided in
terms of distributions of m2- and m5-branes in eleven dimensions. the analysis has
been carried out in detail choosing suitable harmonic functions that describe continuous
distributions of branes in eleven dimensions, and is in accordance with the geometric
deformation of seven and four dimensional spheres induced by the non-trivial moduli
of the underlying algebraic curves. the resulting picture resembles the construction of
domain walls of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity with non-trivial scalar elds in the
coset sl(6, ir)/so(6), where suitable continuous distributions of d3-branes were con-
sidered in ten-dimensional type-iib supergravity. an interesting problem that remains
open for further study is the possible eect of dualities on the structure of domain-wall
(and other) solutions in various dimensions. for example, m2- and m5-branes are related
to each other via electric-magnetic duality, and hence various distributions of them in
eleven dimensions should yield strong-weak coupling relations among solutions of gauged
supergravities in lower dimensions. also, d3-branes appear in a sequence of dualities be-
tween extended objects in higher dimensions, using both s- and t-dualities, and so the
variety of domain walls in d = 4, 5 and 7 dimensions (where consistent truncations of
supergravity are known to exist) ought to be interelated. of course, it will be interesting
to formulate this in the algebro-geometric context provided by the christoelschwarz
transformation, where there is a universal moduli space of the genus 9 riemann surface
for m2-branes y4 = (xb1)(xb2)   (xb8). it has been noted earlier that the riemann
surfaces of d3-branes arise as special cases by taking two of the moduli to innity, while

42

for m5-branes there are three moduli taken to innity. thus, it is quite natural to expect
that the modular transformations of the underlying algebraic curves have a natural inter-
pretation in higher dimensions as s- and t-dualities among branes and their continuous
distributions thereof. we hope to return to this issue in a separate publication.

another topic that has been investigated in detail concerns the analytic form of uc-
tuations for the graviton and scalar elds in our domain-wall backgrounds. since the
quantitative analysis of this problem amounts to solving a one-dimensional quantum me-
chanical problem with potential v (z) that behaves as 1/z2 for z  0 (the asymptotic
ads region), the right identication of the variable z and the associated schrodinger
potential v (z) become crucial for extracting the spectrum. we found that the variable z
appears naturally in the christoelschwarz transformation, which is a complex trans-
formation that maps the interior of a closed polygon in the z-plane onto the upper-half
f -plane, while the variable f is more appropriate for the brane description of our con-
gurations in higher dimensions. thus, the uniformization of the associated algebraic
curves is a necessary step in order to derive the exact form of the potential, in each case
of interest, and, consequently, to determine its spectrum. we were able to complete this
mathematical task for the models with riemann surfaces of genus 0 and 1 and derive
the potentials in closed form for most of these cases. subsequently, using techniques of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which ensure that the spectrum is non-negative, we
were able to compute the spectrum exactly for many models and make estimates using
the wkb approximation for many others. the elliptic models exhibit an interesting
class of potentials within the family of generalized lame potentials, which can be studied
analytically only in certain cases.

it might seem surprising that we have encountered domain wall solutions with very
little or even no isometry in the classication in terms of riemann surfaces. of course, we
are unable to perform the uniformization and nd explicit expressions for the conformal
factor of their metrics and their scalar elds in general, since this has only been done
for models of low genus and hence bigger isometry groups. nevertheless, this situation
can be perfectly accommodated in supersymmetric theories, where all the domain-wall
solutions leave half of the supersymmetries unbroken. it is rather instructive to compare
this situation with the geometry of four-dimensional hyper-kahler manifolds and their
possible isometry groups. recall that all hyper-kahler manifolds are supersymmetric
(preserving half of the supersymmetries) and as such they admit three independent com-
plex structures i, j, k, hence a whole sphere of them, since ai + bj + ck will be a
complex structure if a2 + b2 + c2 = 1. the group so(3) acts naturally on the space of
complex structures as rotations; but this does not necessarily imply that all hyper-kahler
manifolds are so(3) symmetric. although many examples (like eguchihanson, taub
nut and atiyahhitchin) have an so(3) isometry group, there are others with less
isometry or none; for example dancers manifold has only an so(2) isometry, whereas
k3 commonly used in compactications of string theory has no isometries at all.
in
this sense, our domain-wall solutions to gauged supergravities in four, ve and seven
dimensions provide useful tools for developing a deeper understanding of the consistent

43

truncations of eleven-dimensional supergravity, and they can be rather exotic. also, the
associated bogomolnyi bounds and their possible description using contour integrals on
the underlying riemann surfaces pose some interesting mathematical questions for the
future.

finally, there is the conceptual issue of relating r-symmetry to the isometry group
that remains unbroken by the geometric structure of our solutions, which we belief is
worth emphasizing. in our approach, the r-symmetry is spontaneously broken by giving
vacuum expectation values to the scalar elds of the theory that are charged under this
symmetry. then, the r-symmetry is not a symmetry anymore, but relates dierent
vacua of the theory. generically, this procedure also breaks conformal invariance, thus
breaking half of the 32 supersymmetries independently of the amount of symmetry that is
left unbroken. in supergravity this can be understood as follows: for generic values of the
real parameters bi in the master curve y4 = (xb1)(xb2)   (xb8), the gauge symmetry
(related to the r-symmetry in eld theory), is spontaneously broken. in fact, for any
given choice of the parameters, the curve is not invariant under so(8). however, its form
is preserved since so(8) acts naturally on b1, b2,   , b8 in its fundamental representation
and rotates any given choice of moduli bi into another. this is dierent from the situtation
where the background describes a ow from the maximally supersymmetric theory to a
conformal theory with less supersymmetry.
in the latter case the theory is perturbed
by adding suitable deformations to the action, which explicitly break some or all of
supersymmetries; at the ir xed point the geometry is again adsd and the r-symmetry
is related to the number of supersymmetries. this means, in particular, that the isometry
group contains a factor that is equal to the r-symmetry of the eld theory.
