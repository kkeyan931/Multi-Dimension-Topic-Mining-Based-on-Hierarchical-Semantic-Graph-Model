abstract. the dirac equation for a massive spin- 1

2 eld in a central potential v in three
dimensions is studied without xing a priori the functional form of v . the second-order

equations for the radial parts of the spinor wave function are shown to involve a squared

dirac operator for the free case, whose essential self-adjointness is proved by using the weyl

limit point-limit circle criterion, and a perturbation resulting from the potential. one

then nds that a potential of coulomb type in the dirac equation leads to a potential term

in the above second-order equations which is not even innitesimally form-bounded with

respect to the free operator. moreover, the conditions ensuring essential self-adjointness

of the squared dirac operators in the interacting case are changed with respect to the free

case, i.e. they are expressed by a majorization involving the parameter in the coulomb

potential and the angular momentum quantum number. the underlying motivation for

this qualitative analysis is given by the possibility to apply such methods to select suitable

classes of phenomenological potentials.

1. introduction

in the same year when dirac derived the relativistic wave equation for the electron [1],

the work of darwin and gordon had already solved exactly such equation in a coulomb

potential in three spatial dimensions [2, 3]. since those early days, several eorts have

been produced in the literature to solve the dirac equation with other forms of central

potentials, until the recent theoretical attempts to understand connement [48]. in the

massive spin- 1

present paper we study the mathematical foundations of the eigenvalue problem for a
2 eld in a central potential v (r) on r3, without specifying a priori which
function we choose for v (r). in other words, we prefer to draw conclusions on v (r) from

a careful mathematical investigation.

by doing so, we hope to elucidate the general framework of relativistic eigenvalue

problems on the one hand, and to develop powerful tools to understand some key features

of central potentials on the other hand. for this purpose, in section 2 we focus on the

radial parts of the spinor wave function, casting the corresponding second-order ordinary

dierential equations (for the one-dimensional squared dirac operators) in a convenient

form for the subsequent analysis. in section 3, the weyl limit point-limit circle criterion

self-adjoint on the set c

[9] is used to prove that the squared dirac operator for the free problem is essentially
0 (0, ) of smooth functions on (0, ) with compact support
in section 4 some boundedness criteria for perturbations [9, 10]

away from the origin.

are rst described and then applied when the potential in the original dirac equation

consists of terms of coulomb and/or linear type. concluding remarks and open problems

are presented in section 5, and some technical details are summarized in the appendices.

2. second-order equations for stationary states

to be self-contained, some basic material on the dirac equation in a central potential is

presented in appendix a, following [11, 12]. thus, assuming that the reader is familiar

with the formalism, we begin our analysis with the set of coupled eigenvalue equations for

2

the radial parts g(r) and f (r) of the spinor wave function. they read

(2.5)

equation (2.1) yields a formula for f (r) which, upon insertion into eq. (2.2), leads to the

second-order equation

now we can use a well known technique to transform eq. (2.6) into a second-order equation

where the coecient of d

dr vanishes. this is achieved by dening the new function  such

that [13]

(r)  g(r) exp

the function  is then found to obey the dierential equation

(2.11)

now we point out that eq. (2.10) is more conveniently re-expressed in the form (since
k(k + 1) = l(l + 1) in all cases, with k = 1, 2, ...)

(2.12)

(2.13)

such an equation may be viewed as follows: since the potential w perturbs the free

problem for which w vanishes in eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), in the corresponding second-order

equation (2.12) one deals with a free operator

al
r  

d2
dr2 +

l(l + 1)

r2

for all l = 0, 1, ...

(2.14)

perturbed by the multiplication operator pw,e(r) dened in (2.13). an interesting pro-

gramme is therefore emerging at this stage:

(i) first, prove (essential) self-adjointness of the free operator al

r on a certain domain.

(ii) second, try to understand whether the operator

al

r + pw,e(r)

4

in eq. (2.12) remains self-adjoint on the same domain. if this condition is too restrictive,

try to derive all properties of this perturbed second-order operator.

if one rst uses eq. (2.2) to relate g(r) to df

dr and f , one nds instead the second-order

equation

where

3. weyl criterion for the squared dirac operator in the free case

the self-adjointness properties of the free operator (2.14) should be studied by considering

separately the case l > 0 and the case l = 0. for positive values of the quantum number l,

al

r turns out to be essentially self-adjoint. this means that its closure is self-adjoint, and

hence a unique self-adjoint extension of al

r exists. more precisely, we rely on a criterion

due to weyl, and the key steps are as follows [9].

the function v is in the limit circle case at zero if for some, and therefore all , all

solutions of the equation

(cid:20)

d2

dx2 + v (x)(cid:21) (x) = (x)

are square integrable at zero, i.e. for them

z a
0 |(x)|2dx < 

(3.1)

(3.2)

with nite values of a, e.g. a ]0, 1]. if v (x) is not in the limit circle case at zero, it is
said to be in the limit point case at zero. the weyl limit point-limit circle criterion states
that, if v is a continuous real-valued function on (0, ), then the operator

o  

d2
dx2 + v (x)

6

(3.3)

is essentially self-adjoint on c

0 (0, ) if and only if v (x) is in the limit point case at both

zero and innity. the property of being in the limit point at zero relies on

theorem 3.1 let v be continuous and positive near zero. if

v (x) 

x2

3
4

(3.4)

near zero, then o is in the limit point case at zero.

the limit point property at  means that the limit circle condition at  is not

fullled, i.e. the condition

z 

a

|(x)|2dx < 

(3.5)

does not hold. to understand when this happens, one can use

theorem 3.2 if v is dierentiable on ]0, [ and bounded above by a parameter k on
[1, [, and if

z 
v (x)|v (x)| 3
then v (x) is in the limit point case at .

1

dx

pk  v (x)

= 

2

is bounded near 

(3.6)

(3.7)

thus, a necessary and sucient condition for the existence of a unique self-adjoint exten-
sion of o is that its eigenfunctions should fail to be square integrable at zero and at .
powerful operational criteria are provided by the check of (3.4), (3.6) and (3.7), which only

involve the potential.

in our problem, for all l  1, the potential evl(r)  l(l+1)

r2

point at zero, since the inequality (3.4) is then satised. moreover, evl(r) is dierentiable

on ]0, [, bounded above by l  l(l + 1) on [1, [, and such that

is of course in the limit

l (r)|evl(r)| 3

pl(l + 1)

for all r.

(3.9)

hence all conditions of theorem 3.2 are satised, which implies that evl(r) is in the limit

point at  as well. by virtue of the weyl limit point-limit circle criterion, the free operator
r dened in (2.14) is then essentially self-adjoint on c
al

0 (0, ) for all l > 0.

when l = 0, however (for which k = 1), al

dr2 , which
has deciency indices (1, 1). recall that for an (unbounded) operator b with adjoint b,
deciency indices are the dimensions of the spaces of solutions of the equations bu = iu.
more precisely, one denes rst the deciency sub-spaces (d(b) being the domain of b)

r reduces to the operator  d2

h+(b) (cid:8)u  d(b) : bu = iu(cid:9)
h(b) (cid:8)u  d(b) : bu = iu(cid:9)

with corresponding deciency indices

n+(b)  dim h+(b)

n(b)  dim h(b).

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

the operator b is self-adjoint if and only if n+(b) = n(b) = 0, but has self-adjoint

extensions provided that n+(b) = n(b). in our case, half of the solutions of the equations

(a0

r)

u = iu are square-integrable on r+, which implies that n+(a0

r) = n(a0

r) =

ordinary dierential equation [9]

(3.20)

here acloc(r+) denotes the set of locally absolutely continuous functions on the positive

half-line, the prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r, and  is a real-valued param-

eter. bearing in mind the limiting form of eq. (2.12) when l = 0 and w = 0, this means

that one is studying the case characterized by

the very useful formula

(3.23)

(3.24)

this means that in a relativistic problem a lower limit for 2 (and hence for ||) exists, to
avoid having e2 < 0.

to complete the analysis of squared dirac operators in the free case, one has also to

(l+1)(l+2)

consider the operators eal

r dened in (2.23a) and (2.23b). the former has a potential term
which is in the limit point case at both zero and innity for all l  0. the latter

value 1 of the quantum number l, for which eal

4. squared dirac operators in the interacting case

now we would like to understand whether the general results on perturbations of self-

adjoint operators make it possible to obtain a better understanding of eects produced by

the central potential w (r) in eqs. (2.12) and (2.21). for this purpose, the key steps are

as follows [9].

(i) let a and b be densely dened linear operators on a hilbert space h with domains
d(a) and d(b), respectively. if d(a)  d(b) and if, for some a and b in r,

kbk  a kak + b kk for all   d(a)

(4.1)

11

then b is said to be a-bounded. the inmum of such a is called the relative bound of b with

respect to a. if the relative bound vanishes, the operator b is said to be innitesimally

small with respect to a.

(ii) the katorellich theorem states that if a is self-adjoint, b is symmetric, and b is

a-bounded with relative bound a < 1, then a + b is self-adjoint on d(a).

(iii) if the potential v can be written as

v = v1 + v2

(4.2)

with v1  l2(r3) and v2  l(r3), and if v is real-valued, then the operator  +v (x)
is essentially self-adjoint on c
0 (r3) and self-adjoint on d(). as a corollary, the
operator    e2

r is essentially self-adjoint on c

0 (r3).

(iv) an analogue of the katorellich theorem exists which can be used to study the case

when b is not a-bounded. the result can be stated after recalling the following denitions.

let a be a self-adjoint operator on h. on passing to a spectral representation of a

with associated measures {n}n
on the direct sum n

n=1l2(r, dn), one can consider

n=1 on the spectrum of a, so that a is multiplication by x

i ({n(x)}n

n=1 :

 |x||n(x)|2dn < )

nxn=1z 

and hence dene, for  and   i,

q(, ) 

nxn=1z 



x

n(x)n(x)dn.

such a q is called the quadratic form associated with a, and one writes

q(a)  i.

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

the form domain of the operator a is then, by denition, q(a), and can be viewed as the

largest domain on which q can be dened.

12

(v) the klmn theorem states that, if a is a positive self-adjoint operator and if (, )

is a symmetric quadratic form on q(a) such that

|(, )|  a(, a) + b(, ) for all   d(a)

for some a < 1 and b  r, then there exists a unique self-adjoint operator c with

q(c) = q(a)

and

(, c) = (, a) + (, ) for all ,   q(c).

such a c is bounded below by b.

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(vi) if a is a positive self-adjoint operator, and b is a self-adjoint operator such that

q(a)  q(b)

and

|(, b)|  a(, a) + b(, ) for all   d(a)

(4.9)

(4.10)

for some a > 0 and b  r, then b is said to be relatively form-bounded with respect
to a. furthermore, if a can be chosen arbitrarily small, b is said to be innitesimally

form-bounded with respect to a.

(vii) if the operator b is self-adjoint and relatively form-bounded, the parameter a being

< 1, with respect to a positive self-adjoint operator a, then the klmn theorem makes

it possible to dene the sum a + b, although this mathematical construction may dier

from the operator sum.

in particular, b can be form-bounded with respect to a even

though the intersection of their domains may be the empty set.

(viii) the klmn theorem is physically relevant because it leads to the denition of hamil-

tonians even when the katorellich criterion is not fullled. in other words, the request of
dealing with l2+l potentials is too restrictive. for example, the potential v(r) = r

13

2 , 2(cid:2), one can use the klmn theo-
belongs to l2 + l only if  < 3
rem because, for all  < 2, one can prove that r is innitesimally form-bounded with
respect to  (see appendix b).

2 . however, if  (cid:2) 3

in our problem, the potential terms in eqs. (2.12) and (2.21) are given by (2.13) and

(2.22), respectively. if the potential w (r) is of coulomb type, i.e. ( being a dimensionful

constant)

w (r) =


r

(4.11)

the singular behaviour of pw,e(r) as r  0 is dominated by (for a xed value of e)

(2 + 1
4 + k)
r2



and the singular behaviour of epw,e(r) as r  0 is given instead by (again for a xed value

of e)

(2 + 1
4  k)
r2

.



thus, as r  0, the operators on the left-hand sides of both (2.12) and (2.21) reduce to

lr "

d2

4(cid:1)
dr2 +(cid:0)k2  2  1

# .

(4.12)

in the operator lr, the coecient of r2 is no longer greater than or equal to 3

4 (see (3.4))
for the same values of l (see (a7) and (a8)) ensuring essential self-adjointness of the free

problem. the inequality

(4.15)

if k = l. our result implies that, for all |k|  2, essential self-adjointness on c

of the squared dirac operators is obtained provided that ||  3. this reects the fact

that a coulomb potential in the rst-order system (2.1) and (2.2) leads to potential terms

in the second-order equations (2.12) and (2.21) which are not even innitesimally form-

bounded with respect to the squared dirac operators in the free case, because both the

potential terms and the free operators contain terms proportional to r2. to study the

limit point condition at innity, we try to majorize the potential pw,e obtained from the

coulomb potential (4.11), and we nd that

the check of (3.6) and (3.7) for epw,e leads to the same results, and hence we use the weyl

criterion of section 3 to conclude that, for xed values of e, essential self-adjointness on
c
0 (0, ) for the squared dirac operators holds provided that the inequality

k2  2  1

is satised. this rules out l = 0 in (4.14) and l = 1 in (4.15). one then nds that ||  3

as we said before.

the limiting form (4.12) is not aected by the addition of parts linear in r [6, 14, 15]
to the right-hand side of (4.11), because the singular behaviour of pw,e(r) as r  0 is still
dominated by the coulomb potential. by contrast, a purely linear potential

w (r) = r

(4.16)

15

satises the request of innitesimal form-boundedness of pw,e(r) with respect to the

squared dirac operators in the free case, because then the singular behaviour of pw,e(r)
as r  0 is expressed by

k

r



and the singular part of epw,e(r) as r  0 reads

k

.

however, linear terms for all r are undesirable from the point of view of the katorellich

condition (4.1). a better mathematical formulation is obtained by considering linear terms

with compact support, i.e. vanishing for all r greater than some nite r0, or weighted

with exponential functions which ensure a fall-o condition at innity. we may therefore

consider, as a better mathematical approximation (cf (4.11) and (4.16)), the potential (cf

[14])

w (r) =


r

+ rer

(4.17)

where  is positive.
in such a case, the limiting behaviours of pw,e as r  0 and as
r   are still dominated by the coulomb part in the potential w , and hence we nd
again essential self-adjointness on c

0 (0, ) provided that k2  2  1.

in the physical literature, however, the potential has not been written in the form

(4.17). to achieve connement, a purely linear term has instead been added to the coulomb

part, considering also a split of the additional part into lorentz scalar-type and lorentz

vector-like potentials. furthermore, such a vector contribution is sometimes omitted in

a phenomenological analysis, bearing in mind its non-perturbative nature (since the per-

turbative part has instead vector nature) [16]. needless to say, such arguments are not

compulsory, and it remains to be seen whether a mathematical approach may legitimate

the use of potentials along the lines of (4.17).

5. concluding remarks

the contributions of our paper, of technical nature, consist in the application of analytic

techniques that can help to understand some key qualitative features of central potentials

for the dirac equation, with emphasis on the mathematical formulation of relativistic

eigenvalue problems. although the methods used in our investigation are well known

in the literature, the overall picture remains, to our knowledge, original (see comments

below). in particular, we would like to mention the following points (at the risk of slight

repetitions).

(i) the forms (2.12) and (2.21) of the second-order equations for the radial parts of the

spinor wave function, with pw,e(r) and epw,e(r) dened in (2.13) and (2.22), respectively,

is very convenient if one wants to understand whether the potential can aect the self-

adjointness domain of the free problem.

(ii) the identication of the domains of (essential) self-adjointness of the operators dened

in (2.14), (2.23a) and (2.23b) is helpful as a rst step towards the problem with non-

vanishing potential w (r), and claries the general framework.

(iii) a potential of coulomb type, although quite desirable from a physical point of view,

leads to some non-trivial features with respect to the non-relativistic case. we have in fact

seen that pw,e(r) and epw,e(r) fail to be innitesimally form-bounded with respect to the

squared dirac operators in the free case, if w (r) contains a coulomb term. moreover,

the limit-point condition at zero for the potential in the squared dirac operators in the

essential self-adjointness on c

interacting case is only fullled if the inequalities (4.14) or (4.15) hold. in other words, the
0 (0, ) of the squared dirac operators with non-vanishing
potential is still obtained, but under more restrictive conditions expressed by (4.14) and

(4.15). this may have non-trivial physical implications: if essential self-adjointness fails

to hold, we know from the end of section 3 that dierent self-adjoint extensions of the

squared dirac operator exist, characterized by the choice of regular boundary condition at

r = 0 (cf (3.20)). the lowest values of l (for which (4.13) does not hold), corresponding to

the bound states of greater phenomenological interest, might therefore nd an appropriate

17

mathematical description within the framework of self-adjoint extensions of symmetric

operators. it remains to be seen how much freedom is left, on physical ground, to specify

the boundary conditions for the self-adjoint extension.

indeed, as far as the dirac operator d is concerned, one can prove its essential self-

adjointness on c

0 (cid:16)r3  {0}(cid:17) in the presence of a coulomb potential provided that ||

(see (4.11)) is majorized by 1
2

3, as is shown in [17], following work by weidmann (see
page 130 in [17] and references therein). in our paper, however, we have focused on the

squared dirac operators dd and dd (d being the formal adjoint of d), and the

consideration of a central potential, with the associated hilbert space

l2(r+, r2dr)  l2(s2, d)

has eventually led to the one-dimensional version of the squared dirac operators, i.e.

the second-order operators occurring in (2.12) and (2.21) and acting on square-integrable

functions on the positive half-line. our calculations, summarized in the points (i)(iii)
3 found
above, remain therefore original. we should notice that the condition || < 1
in [17] is compatible with our inequalities (4.14) and (4.15) for all l  2. in other words,
the condition on  ensuring essential self-adjointness of the dirac operator leads also to

2

(one may nd a || smaller than 3 but greater than 1

essential self-adjointness of the squared dirac operator, whereas the converse does not hold
3). our analysis has possibly the
merit of having shown that some extra care is necessary when l = 0, 1, but this should not

2

be unexpected, if one bears in mind from section 3 that already in the free case the values

l = 0, 1 make it necessary to perform a separate analysis (cf [18]).

we should also acknowledge that in [19] the essential self-adjointness of powers of

the dirac operator had been proved, but in cases when the potential v is smooth.

in

particular, when the potential is a c function on r3, no growth conditions on it are

necessary to ensure essential self-adjointness of any power of the dirac operator [9, 19].

in our problem, however, we have considered a coulomb term in the potential, which is

singular at the origin. although a regular solution of the eigenvalue problem exists [8, 15],

since the origin remains a fuchsian singular point, the domain of essential self-adjointness

18

of the squared dirac operators in the interacting case is changed. this is reected by the

inequality (4.13) for the fulllment of the limit-point condition at zero, which now involves

, and hence the atomic number [11, 12]. note also that, to nd a real-valued solution

which is regular at the origin in a coulomb eld, one only needs the weaker condition
k2  2 [11, 12]. thus, a careful investigation of the essential self-adjointness issue picks
out a subset of the general set of real-valued regular solutions.

for simplicity, we have considered in the end of section 4 only one linear term.

more precisely, however, two linear terms are often studied, of scalar and vector nature,

respectively [8]. moreover, a naturally occurring question is whether one can extend our

qualitative analysis to study the (essential) self-adjointness issue for operators involving

the square root of the laplacian [20], i.e. pp2 + m2  ze2

r . such problems have been
the object of intensive investigations, but more work could be done from the point of

view of rigorous mathematical foundations.

in the light of the above remarks, there is

some encouraging evidence that new insight into the choice of phenomenological central

potentials can be gained by applying some powerful analytic techniques along the lines

described in our paper. in the near future, one might therefore hope to re-interpret from

a deeper perspective the previous work in the literature, including the class of potentials

responsible for connement.
