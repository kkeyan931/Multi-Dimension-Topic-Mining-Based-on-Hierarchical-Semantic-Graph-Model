abstract

we consider random superstrings of type iib in d-dimensional space. the
discretized action is constructed from the supersymetric matrix model, which
has been proposed as a constructive denition of superstring theory. our
action is invariant under the local n = 2 super transformations, and doesnt
have any redundant fermionic degrees of freedom.

recent remarkable developments in superstring theory are mostly due to duality
and the d-brane [1]. they shed light on the universal framework of the theory as
well as on its non-perturbative face. following these discoveries, constructive de-
nitions of superstring were proposed [2, 3], which provide practical prescriptions of
how to proceed beyond perturbative limits. those theories are expressed on the
basis of matrices, and are expected to restore the string picture in the limit of large
matrix dimension, as it had been in the old matrix model [4]. once we have a
constructive denition of the theory, it is a natural step to look for a proper regu-
larization scheme in order to perform practical analysis. as we have experienced in
the course of developing qcd, lattice regularization is the most powerful method
for extending the analysis into all regions of the coupling strength. understanding
quantum gravity in terms of superstrings is commonly recognized as being essen-
tially non-perturbative. in fact, several eorts to construct superstring theory on
a lattice have been tried [5, 6]. in those studies the green-schwarz superstring ac-
tion was discretized while maintaining the local supersymmetry. the problem in
those descriptions is that the local -symmetry is not explicitly fullled, and it is
expected to recover only in a suitable continuum limit. in the recent constructive
formulation of superstring based on the type iib model, the redundant fermionic
degrees are removed by a special choice of fermionic pairs in accordance with the
local -symmetry. the action of type iib matrix model is then expressed in the
semi-classical (i.e. large matrix size) limit by

here, x  ( = 1, 2,   , d) are the d-dimensional space-time coordinates, and a
(a = 1, 2,  , n) are n sets of the anti-commuting spinor coordinates. also, g
is the absolute value of the determinant of world-sheet metric (gab), and ab is an
anti-symmetric tensor. the n = 2 supersymmetry manifests itself in s under

in order to obtain the discretized action corresponding to s, we perform triangu-
lations of world-sheet by equilateral triangles with side length a. the action is a sum

over contributions from each triangle with three vertices i, j and k: s = phijki shijki.

on each triangle both bosonic and fermionic elds are approximated by linear func-
tions of local world-sheet coordinates (1, 2). since the poisson brackets on each

1

triangle are constant for linearly approximated elds, the integral over a triangle
can be trivially carried out and the discretized action is obtained as

s = sb + sf  xhijki(cid:16)shijkib + shijkif

and where the symmetric pair eld is dened as ahiji = 1

property of the surface generated by the discretized bosonic action was studied
previously in [7], while the fermionic part was proposed in [5] separately. to show
the n = 2 supersymmetry, we needed to rewrite the transformation so as to be valid
in a discretized world-sheet. straightforward discretization of eq. (3) leads to

we note that the poisson bracket is constant on each triangle, and thus the variation
of the fermionic eld (1)hijki is also dened on the triangle. let us rst consider the

this (1)s vanishes in the cases of d = 3, 4, 6 or 10 by making use of properties of
 matrices. for the local supersymmetry, we must pay attention to the one-to-one
correspondence between the variations of the fermionic variables on the triangles
and on the vertices. for this purpose we have checked whether there exist n0
independent relations among the n2 = 2(n0  ) equations,

for suciently large surfaces with the euler characteristic . in order to count how
many independent relations exist among the n2 relations, we compute numerically
orthonormal vectors with n0 components by schmidts method. for most of the
large n0 congurations except those which have very high spacial symmetry, there
exist n0 orthonormal vectors, and thus there mostly exists the one-to-one correspon-
dence between triangles and vertices for suciently large surfaces. for congurations
with extra space symmetry, for example the discrete rotational symmetry, however,
the number of orthonormal vectors becomes less than n0. because these congura-
tions are expected to have degeneracy, we need to include the symmetry factor in

simulations.
quantization is carried out by the standard path-integral method. the integra-
tion over g is interpreted as the sum over dynamical triangulations. for the type
iib supersring, the discretized partition function with a xed number of vertices is
given by

where s(t ) is the symmetry factor of the triangulation (t ) to take into account the
degeneracy. it is noticed that the modes associated with the translational invariance
of the action for bosonic elds and the (2) supersymmetry for fermionic variables
have been eliminated by xing at zero for variables on i = 0 vertex. in the following
we consider the case of a tetrahedron world-sheet, which corresponds to the smallest
tree diagram. in this case the triangulation is unique, since a conguration with
four vertices is only a tetrahedron in our convention of not allowing tadpoles and
self-energies. by xing the vertex x0 at the origin and the triangle h012i on the x-z
plane as shown in fig. 1, their integration measures are dened by

from eq. (19), the partition function of the tetrahedron is found to be nite for
d + k  5. thus, it shows that the fermion suppress the divergence. however, in
this case, even the partition function of the bosonic string becomes nite when d  5.
we have checked numerically that uctuation of the mean square distance from the
center of mass diverges like the random walk for d  4 cases while it converges for
d  5 cases.
however, this is not so simple for larger size congurations. in fact, we have
found numerically that the partition function of the bosonic string shows the spike
singularity [7] for large n0 in the case of d = 5. we have calculated the coordination
number distributions pn0(q) for the d = 5 case which is shown by the dotted line
in fig. 2. we observe the zigzag structure where at the coordination number q = 3
and at even q values for q  6 it shows peaks and at q = 4 and at odd q values for
q  5 it shows valleys. when we pick up even coordination numbers and calculate

pn0(q) =

for q  3,

where n0 = pq=3pn0

2q, qi, and qi denotes the coordination number of vertex i,
we obtain the distribution shown by the dashed line in fig. 2. it is similar to the
distribution for pure gravity [8], as shown by the solid line. from this result, we
can imagine that the congurations of the bosonic string are something like the one
illustrated in fig. 3. the solid lines in fig. 3 are expected to describe almost like the
same conguration as the pure gravity case. if the elds on vertices around a vertex
i with coordination number qi = 3 shrink into a point, its area becomes zero for any

 we use the relation,

i . thus, we expect even for the case of d > 5, the partition function
diverges for a large n0 system.
in order to avoid these divergences, we should
consider the superstrings, because it is expected that these diverges are caused by
tachyons of the bosonic elds, and it will be suppressed by the contribution of
fermionic elds of superstrings.

in conclusion, among several possible models of superstrings, we have considered
the type iib superstrings. we have proposed the discretized type iib superstring
action, and have shown that it is invariant under the local n = 2 super transforma-
tions. in the green-schwarz superstring action, there contains a topological term
for the local -symmetry in order to separate the extra fermionic degree of freedom.
existence of the topological term makes it dicult to discretize the green-schwarz
superstring. on the other hand, in the type iib superstring which we have employed,
the action has no extra fermionic degree, which has been essential in the numerical
study. the partition function for the tetrahedron conguration of the world-sheet
has shown that eects of the fermionic elds indeed suppress the divergence, and
suggest that it also make the surface smooth for large systems. for further stud-
ies, we need to nd a powerful method which provide a method to calculate the
fermionic determinant quickly for a larger system.
