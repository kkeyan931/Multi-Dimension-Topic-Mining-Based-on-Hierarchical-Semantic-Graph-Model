introduction

the d1/d5 system has been crucial in understanding black hole physics in string theory.

our current understanding of the microscopic derivation of black hole entropy and hawk-

ing radiation rests mainly on this model [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. the d1/d5 system also provides

a concrete realization of holography in the near horizon limit [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. un-

like in other examples of adsd+1/cf td duality, this system provides an example where

both sides of the duality are well tractable.

the d1/d5 system is constructed as follows. consider type iib string theory com-
pactied on t 4 (one could also consider k3 ). let us assume that the coordinates of the
compactied directions are x6,7,8,9. let us consider q5 d5-branes extending along x5,6,7,8,9
and wrap four of the directions along the t 4. also let us consider q1 d1-branes extend-
ing along the coordinate x5. this leaves us with a black string in six dimensions carrying
electric as well as magnetic charge under the ramond-ramond eld c (2)  b. the much
studied example of the ve dimensional black hole solution is obtained by compactifying

the x5 coordinate and introducing kaluza-klein momentum along this direction [2]. the

complete specication of the d1/d5 system includes various moduli. most of the study

of the d1/d5 system so far has been focused on the situation with no moduli. it is known

from supergravity that the d1/d5 system with no moduli turned on is marginally stable

with respect to decay of a subsystem consisting of q

1 d1 branes. it has been
observed recently [14] that such a decay in fact signals a singularity in the world volume

5 d5 and q

gauge theory associated with the origin of the higgs branch. the issue of stability in

supergravity in the context of the d1/d5 system has also been discussed in [15, 16].

the singularity mentioned above leads to a singular conformal eld theory and hence

to a breakdown of string perturbation theory. however, generic values of the supergravity

moduli which do not involve fragmentation into constituents are described by well-dened

conformal eld theories and therefore string perturbation theory makes sense.

in this

paper, we would like to understand the d1/d5 system at a generic point in the moduli

space. in particular, we address two issues: (a) what is the boundary scft corresponding

to the d1/d5 system at generic values of the moduli? (b) to what extent do the various

moduli aect the hawking rate of the minimal scalars computed from the microscopic

2

scft?

the low energy description of the d1/d5 system is given by a n = (4, 4) scft on
the moduli space of q1 instantons of a u(q5) gauge theory on t 4. this moduli space
is conjectured to be a resolution of the orbifold (et 4)q1q5/s(q1q5) [17] which we shall
denote by m. et 4 can be distinct from the compactication torus t 4. the evidence for

this conjecture is mainly topological and is related to dualities which map the black string

corresponding to the d1/d5 system to a perturbative string of type iib theory with q1
units of momentum and q5 units of winding along the x5 direction [18]. an orbifold theory

realized as a free eld scft with identications is nonsingular as all correlations functions
are nite. the realization of the scft of the d1/d5 system as n = (4, 4) theory on
m implies that we are at a generic point in the moduli space of the d1/d5 system and
not at the singularity corresponding to fragmentation. in other words, the orbifold scft

corresponds to a bound state of q1 d1-branes and q5 d5-branes (henceforth denoted as
the (q1, q5) bound state). thus we use the free eld realization of n = (4, 4) scft on
the orbifold m and its resolutions using the marginal operators of this theory to describe
the boundary scft corresponding to the d1/d5 system at generic values of the moduli.

we construct all the 20 marginal operators of this theory including the 4 blow up modes

explicitly. we use symmetries, including a new global so(4) algebra, to identify the

marginal operators with their corresponding supergravity moduli.

once we have found the four marginal operators corresponding to the blow up modes,

we address the question how to understand their origin in the gauge theory of the d1/d5

system and also how to describe the splitting of the (q1, q5) bound state into subsys-
tems (q

5) in the gauge theory language. we nd that the dynamics

hypermultiplets. we show, by an analysis of the d-term equations and the potential, that

of this splitting is described by an eective (4, 4) u(1) theory coupled to q

5) and (q

1, q

1, q

1q

5 + q

the splitting is possible only when the fayet-iliopoulos terms and the theta term of the

eective gauge theory are zero. these, therefore, should correspond to the four scft

marginal operators corresponding to the blow up modes.

we also address the question whether the hawking rate of minimal scalars of the

ve dimensional black hole at a generic point in the moduli space of the d1/d5 system

agrees with the scft calculation. we nd that the absorption cross-section and hawk-

3

ing rate do not depend on the moduli in supergravity, essentially because the minimal

scalars are coupled only to the einstein metric which remains unchanged under u-duality

transformations generating the moduli. in the scft the calculation of the absorption

cross-section/hawking radiation depends on the two-point function of the corresponding

operators, and we show that turning on the exactly marginal perturbations do not modify

the cross-section or the rate.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we construct all the marginal operators
of the n = (4, 4) scft on m and identify their quantum numbers under the symmetries
of the scft. in section 3 we make a one-to-one identication of the supergravity moduli

with the marginal operators in the scft. in section 4 we analyze the gauge dynamics

of the d1/d5 system relevant for splitting into subsystems.

in section 5 we discuss

absorption/hawking radiation of the minimal scalars from supergravity and scft in the

presence of moduli. section 6 contains concluding remarks.

2 the resolutions of the symmetric product

in this section we will construct marginal operators of the n = (4, 4) scft on the
symmetric product orbifold m. we will nd the four operators which correspond to
resolution of the orbifold singularity.

the scft is described by the free lagrangian

here i runs over the ft 4 coordinates 1,2,3,4 and a = 1, 2, . . . q1q5 labels various copies of

introduce the following notations:

similarly ea(z) will denote the antiholomorphic counterparts of the above fermions. (see

appendix a for more details.)

2.1 the untwisted sector

let us rst focus on the operators constructed from the untwisted sector. the operators

of lowest conformal weight are

a(z)e1
a (z)e1
r) = (1/2, 1/2) under the r-symmetry su(2)r  gsu(2)r
r,ej3

where summation over a is implied. these four operators have conformal dimension
(h, h) = (1/2, 1/2) and (j3
(see appendix a). since (h, h) = (j3

r), these operators are chiral primaries and
have non-singular operator product expansions (ope) with the supersymmetry currents

a(z)e2
a (z)e2

a (z)

r,ej3

g1(z), g2(z), eg1(z), eg2(z) (dened in appendix a). these properties indicate that they

belong to the bottom component of the short multiplet (2, 2)s (see appendix b for de-

tails). each of the four chiral primaries gives rise to four top components of the short
multiplet (2, 2)s. they are given by the leading pole ((z  w)1(z  w)1) in the opes

(4)

(5)

g2(z)g2(z)p(w, w)
g1(z)eg2(z)p(w, w)

g2(z)eg1(z)p(w, w)
g1(z)eg1(z)p(w, w)

where p stands for any of the four chiral primaries in (4). from the superconformal
algebra it is easily seen that the top components constructed above have weights (1, 1)
and transform as (1, 1) under su(2)r  gsu(2)r. the opes (5) can be easily evaluated.

we nd that the 16 top components of the 4(2, 2)s short multiplets are xi
a

xj
a.

we classify the above operators belonging to the top component according to rep-

resentations of (a) the so(4)i rotational symmetry (appendix a) of the et 4, (the four

torus t 4 breaks this symmetry but we assume the target space is r4 for the classication

of states) (b) r symmetry of the scft and (c) the conformal weights. as all of these

operators belong to the top component of (2, 2)s the only property which distinguishes

them is the representation under so(4)i. the quantum numbers of these operators under

5

therefore we have 16 marginal operators from the untwisted sector. as these are top

components they can be added to the free scft as perturbations without violating the
n = (4, 4) supersymmetry.

2.2 z2 twists.

we now construct the marginal operators from the various twisted sectors of the orbifold
scft. the twist elds of the scft on the orbifold m are labeled by the conjugacy
classes of the symmetric group s(q1q5) [19, 20]. the conjugacy classes consist of cyclic

groups of various lengths. the various conjugacy classes and the multiplicity in which

they occur in s(q1q5) can be found from the solutions of the equation

x nnn = q1q5

(7)

where n is the length of the cycle and nn is the multiplicity of the cycle. consider the
simplest nontrivial conjugacy class which is given by n1 = q1q5  2, n2 = 1 and the rest
of nn = 0. a representative element of this class is

(x1  x2, x2  x1), x3  x3, . . . , xq1q5  xq1q5

(8)

here the xas are related to the xas appearing in the action (1) by (64) in appendix a.

to exhibit the singularity of this group action we go over to the following new coordi-

nates

xcm = x1 + x2 and  = x1  x2

(9)

under the group action (8) xcm is invariant and   . thus the singularity is locally
of the type r4/z2. the bosonic twist operators for this orbifold singularity are given by

following opes [21]

1(z)1(w, w) =

 1(w, w)
(z  w)1/2

6

1(z)1(w, w) =

 1(w, w)
(z  w)1/2

(10)

 2(w, w)
(z  w)1/2

 2(w, w)
(z  w)1/2

2(z)2(w, w) =

2(z)2(w, w) =

e1(z)1(w, w) = e 1(w, w)
e2(z)2(w, w) = e 2(w, w)

(z  w)1/2

(z  w)1/2

e1(z)1(w, w) = e 1(w w)
e2(z)2(w, w) = e 2(w, w)

(z  w)1/2

(z  w)1/2

the  s are excited twist operators. the fermionic twists are constructed from bosonized

currents dened by

1(z) = eih 1(z)

1(z) = eih 1(z)

2(z) = eih 2(z)

2(z) = eih 2(z)

(11)

where the s, dened as 1  2, are the superpartners of the bosons .

from the above we construct the supersymmetric twist elds which act both on

fermions and bosons as follows:

(12) = 1(z, z)2(z, z)eih 1(z)/2eih 2(z)/2eieh 1(z)/2eieh 2(z)/2
(12) = 1(z, z)2(z, z)eih 1(z)/2eih 2(z)/2eieh 1(z)/2eieh 2(z)/2
(12) = 1(z, z)2(z, z)eih 1(z)/2e+ih 2(z)/2eieh 1(z)/2eieh 2(z)/2
= 1(z, z)2(z, z)eih 1(z)/2e+ih 2(z)/2eieh 1(z)/2e+ieh 2(z)/2

the subscript (12) refers to the fact that these twist operators were constructed for the

representative group element (8) which exchanges the 1 and 2 labels of the coordinates

of et 4. the superscript stands for the (j3
r,ej3
r) quantum numbers. the twist operators
for the orbifold m belonging to the conjugacy class under consideration is obtained by
summing over these z2 twist operators for all representative elements of this class.

(13)

we can dene the rest of the twist operators for the orbifold in a similar manner. the

conformal dimensions of these operators are (1/2, 1/2). they transform as (2, 2) under

the su(2)r  gsu(2)r symmetry of the scft. they belong to the bottom component of

7

the short multiplet (2, 2)s. the operator ( 1

2 , 1

2 ) is a chiral primary. as before the 4 top

components of this short multiplet, which we denote by

t ( 1
t ( 1

are given by the leading pole in the following opes respectively

these are the 4 blow up modes of the r4/z2 singularity [22] and they have conformal

weight (1, 1)1. they transform as (1, 1) under the su(2)r  gsu(2)r. as before, since
these are top components of the short multiplet (2, 2)s they can be added to the free
scft as perturbations without violating the n = (4, 4) supersymmetry of the scft.
the various quantum numbers of these operators are listed below.

the rst three operators of the above table can be organized as a (1, 3) under su(2)i 
gsu(2)i. we will denote these 3 operators as t 1. the last operator transforms as a scalar
(1, 1) under su(2)i  gsu(2)i and is denoted by t 0. the simplest way of guring out
the (j3,ej3)i quantum numbers in the above table is to note that (a) the -operators of
(12) are singlets under su(2)i  gsu(2)i, as can be veried by computing the action on
them of the operators i1, i2 and ei1,ei2, (b) the t -operators are obtained from s by the
supersymmetry currents under i1, i2 and ei1,ei2 are given by (68).

action of the supersymmetry currents as in (15) and (c) the quantum numbers of the

1relevance of z2 twist operators to the marginal deformations of the scft has earlier been discussed

in [23, 24]

2.3 higher twists

we now show that the twist operators corresponding to any other conjugacy class of
s(q1q5) are irrelevant. consider the class with n1 = q1q5  3, n3 = 1 and the rest of
nn = 0. a representative element of this class is

(x1  x2, x2  x3, x3  x1), x4  x4, . . . , xq1q5  xq1q5.

(17)

to make the action of this group element transparent we diagonalize the group action as

follows.

where  = exp(2i/3). these new coordinates are identied under the group action (17)
1  1, 2  22 and 3  3. these identications are locally characteristic of the
orbifold

r4  r4/  r4/2

(19)

the dimension of the supersymmetric twist operator which twists the coordinates by a

phase e2ik/n in 2 complex dimensions is h(k, n) = k/n[21]. the twist operator which

implements the action of the group element (17) combines the supersymmetric twist

operators acting on 2 and 3 and therefore has total dimension

h = h(1, 3) + h(2, 3) = 1/3 + 2/3 = 1

(20)

it is the superpartners of these which could be candidates for the blow up modes. however,

these have weight 3/2, these operators are therefore irrelevant.

for the class n1 = q1q5  k , nk = k and the rest of nn = 0, the total dimension of

the twist operator is

h =

h(i, k) = (k  1)/2

(21)

k1xi=1

its superpartner has dimension k/2. now it is easy to see that all conjugacy classes other

than the exchange of 2 elements give rise to irrelevant twist operators. thus the orbifold
m is resolved by the 4 blow up modes corresponding to the conjugacy class represented
by (8). we have thus identied the 20 marginal operators of the n = (4, 4) scft on et 4.

they are all top components of the 5(2, 2)s short multiplets.

9

3 the supergravity moduli and the resolutions of the orbifold.

in this section we nd the massless scalar elds which couple to the 4 blow up modes
of the orbifold m. type iib supergravity compactied on t 4 has 25 scalars. there
i, j, k . . . stands for
are 10 scalars hij which arise from compactication of the metric.
the directions of t 4. there are 6 scalars bij which arise from the neveu-schwarz b-eld
and similarly there are 6 scalars b
ij from the ramond-ramond b-eld. the remaining
3 scalars are the dilaton , the ramond-ramond scalar  and the ramond-ramond 4-
form c6789. these scalars parameterize the coset so(5, 5)/(so(5)  so(5)). the near
horizon limit of the d1/d5 system is ads3  s3  t 4 [6].
in this geometry 5 of the
25 scalars become massive. they are the hii (the trace of the metric of t 4 which is
proportional to the volume of t 4), the 3 components of the anti-self dual part of the
neveu-schwarz b-eld b

ij and a linear combination of the ramond-ramond scalar and
the 4-form [14]. the massless scalars in the near horizon geometry parameterize the coset
so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4) [10].

the near horizon symmetries form the supergroup su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). this is
the global part of the n = (4, 4) superconformal algebra. we can classify [11, 12] all
the massless supergravity elds of type iib supergravity on ads3  s3  t 4 ignoring the
kaluza-klein modes on t 4 according to the short multiplets of the supergroup su(1, 1|2)
su(1, 1|2). the massless elds of the supergravity fall into the top component of the
5(2, 2)s short multiplet. we further classify these elds according to the representations
of the so(4)i, the rotations of the x6,7,8,9 directions. this is not a symmetry of the
supergravity as it is compactied on t 4, but it can be used to classify states. the

quantum number of the massless supergravity elds are listed below.

the linear combination appearing on the fourth line is the one that remains massless in

10

the near-horizon limit. the su(2)e  gsu(2)e stands for the so(4) isometries of the s3.

all the above elds are s-waves of scalars in the near horizon geometry.

we would like to match the twenty supergravity moduli appearing in (22) with the

twenty marginal operators appearing in (6) and (16) by comparing their symmetry prop-

erties under the ads/cft correspondence [12].

the symmetries, or equivalently quantum numbers, to be compared under the ads/cft

correspondence [7, 25, 26, 8] are as follows:

(a) the isometries of the supergravity are identied with the global symmetries of

the superconformal eld theory. for the ads3 case the symmetries form the supergroup
su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2). the identication of this supergroup with the global part of the
n = (4, 4) superalgebra leads to the following mass-dimension relation

h + h = 1 + 1 + m2

(23)

where m is the mass of the bulk eld and (h, h) are the dimensions of the scft operator.

since in our case the scft operators are marginal and the supergravity elds are massless,

the mass-dimension relation is obviously satised.

(b) the su(2)e  gsu(2)e quantum number of the bulk supergravity eld corresponds
to the su(2)r  su(2)r quantum number of the boundary operator. by an inspection
of column three of the tables in (6), (16) and (22), we see that these quantum numbers

also match.

(c) the supersymmetry properties of the bulk elds and the boundary operators tell

us which component of the short multiplet they belong to. noting the fact that all the

twenty bulk elds as well as all the marginal operators mentioned above correspond to

top components of short multiplets, this property also matches.

(d) the above symmetries alone do not distinguish between the twenty operators or

the twenty bulk elds. to further distinguish these operators and the elds we identify
the so(4)i symmetry of the directions x6,7,8,9 with the s0(4)i of the scft. at the level

of classication of states this identication is reasonable though these are not actual sym-

metries. using the quantum numbers under this group we obtain the following matching

11

of the boundary operators and the supergravity moduli.

note that both the representations (1, 3) and (1, 1) occur twice in the above table. this

could give rise to a two-fold ambiguity in identifying either (1, 3) or (1, 1) operators with

their corresponding bulk elds. the way we have resolved it here is as follows. the
operators t 1 and t 0 correspond to blow up modes of the orbifold, and since these are
related to the fayet-iliopoulos terms and the -term in the gauge theory (see section

4), tuning these operators one can reach the singular scft [14] that corresponds to

fragmentation of the d1/d5 system.

thus, we arrive at a one-to-one identication between operators of the scft and the

supergravity moduli.

4 the linear sigma model

in this section we will analyze the gauge theory description of the d1/d5 system. we show

that that the gauge theory has four parameters which control the break up of the (q1, q5)
system to subsystems (q

the theta term in the eective u(1) (4, 4) linear sigma model of the relative coordinate

4.1 the linear sigma model description of r4/z2

the linear sigma model is a 1 + 1 description of the r4/z2 singularity dimensional u(1)

gauge theory with (4, 4) supersymmetry [27]. it has 2 hypermultiplets charged under the

u(1). the scalar elds of the hypermultiplets can be organized as doublets under the

su(2)r symmetry of the (4, 4) theory as

1 =

a1
b
1

 and 2 =

a2
b
2



(25)

the as have charge +1 and the bs have charge 1 under the u(1). the vector multiplet
has 4 real scalars i, i = 1, . . . , 4. they do not transform under the su(2)r. one can

include 4 parameters in this theory consistent with (4,4) supersymmetry. they are the 3

fayet-iliopoulos terms and the theta term.

let us rst investigate the hypermultiplet moduli space of this theory with the 3

fayet-iliopoulos terms and the theta term set to zero. the higgs phase of this theory is

obtained by setting i and the d-terms to zero. the d-term equations are

|a1|2 + |a2|2  |b1|2  |b2|2 = 0
a1b1 + a2b2 = 0

(26)

the hypermultiplet moduli space is the space of solutions of the above equations modded

out by the u(1) gauge symmetry. counting the number of degrees of freedom indicate

that this space is 4 dimensional. to obtain the explicit form of this space it is convenient

to introduce the following gauge invariant variables

n = a2b1

m = a1b2
p = a1b1 = a2b2

(27)

(28)

these variables are not independent. setting the d-terms equal to zero and modding out

the resulting space by u(1) is equivalent to the equation

p 2 + mn = 0.

(29)

13

this homogeneous equation is an equation of the space r4/z2. to see this the solution

of the above equation can be parametrized by 2 complex numbers (, ) such that

p = i m =  2 n = 2

(30)

thus the point (, ) and (,) are the same point in the space of solutions of (29).
we have shown that the hypermultiplet moduli space is r4/z2.

the above singularity at the origin of the moduli space is a geometric singularity in the

hypermultiplet moduli space. we now argue that this singularity is a genuine singularity

of the scft that the linear sigma model ows to in the infrared. at the origin of the

classical moduli space the coulomb branch meets the higgs branch. in addition to the

potential due to the d-terms the linear sigma model contains the following term in the

superpotential2

v = (|a1|2 + |a2|2 + |b1|2 + |b2|2)(2

1 + 2

2 + 2

3 + 2
4)

(31)

thus at the origin of the hypermultiplet moduli space a at direction for the coulomb

branch opens up. the ground state at this point is not normalizable due to the non-

compactness of the coulomb branch. this renders the infrared scft singular.

this singularity can be avoided in two distinct ways.

if one turns on the fayet-

iliopoulos d-terms, the d-term equations are modied to [27]

|a1|2 + |a2|2  |b1|2  |b2|2 = r3

a1b1 + a2b2 = r1 + ir2

(32)

where r1, r2, r3 are the 3 fayet-iliopoulos d-terms transforming as the adjoint of the

su(2)r. now the origin is no more a solution of these equations and the non-compactness

of the coulomb branch is avoided. in this case wave-functions will have compact sup-

port all over the hypermultiplet moduli space. this ensures that the infrared scft is

non-singular. turning on the fayet-iliopoulos d-terms thus correspond to the geometric

resolution of the singularity. the resolved space is known to be [27, 28] described by an

eguchi-hanson metric in which r1,2,3 parameterize a shrinking two-cycle.

2these terms can be understood from the coupling aa in six dimensions, and recognizing that
under dimensional reduction to two dimensions is appear from the components of a in the compact
directions.

14

the second way to avoid the singularity in the scft is to turn on the theta angle .

this induces a constant electric eld in the vacuum. this electric eld is screened at any

other point than the origin in the hypermultiplet moduli space as the u(1) gauge eld is

massive with a mass proportional to the vacuum expectation value of the hypers. at the

origin the u(1) eld is not screened and thus it contributes to the energy density of the

vacuum. this energy is proportional to 2. thus turning on the theta term lifts the at

directions of the coulomb branch. this ensures that the corresponding infrared scft is

well dened though the hypermultiplet moduli space remains geometrically singular. in

terms of the eguchi-hanson space, the -term corresponds to a ux of the antisymmetric

tensor through the two-cycle mentioned above.

the (4, 4) scft on r4/z2 at the orbifold point is well dened. since the orbifold has a

geometric singularity but the scft is non-singular it must correspond to the linear sigma

model with a nite value of  and the fayet-iliopoulos d-terms set to zero. deformations
of the r4/z2 orbifold by its 4 blow up modes correspond to changes in the fayet-iliopoulos
d-terms and theta term of the linear sigma model3 the global description of the moduli
of a n = (4, 4) scft on a resolved r4/z2 orbifold is provided by the linear sigma model.
in conclusion let us describe this linear sigma model in terms of the gauge theory of

d-branes. the theory described above arises on a single d1-brane in presence of 2 d5-

branes. the singularity at the at the point r1, r2, r3,  = 0 is due to noncompactness of

the at direction of the coulomb branch. thus it corresponds to the physical situation

of the d1-brane leaving the d5-branes.

4.2 the gauge theory description of the moduli of the d1/d5

system

as we have seen in section 2 the resolutions of the n = (4, 4) scft on m is described by
4 marginal operators which were identied in the last subsection with the fayet-iliopoulos
d-terms and the theta term of the linear sigma model description of the r4/z2 singularity.

we want to now indicate how these four parameters would make their appearance in the

3if we identify the su (2)r of the linear sigma-model with gsu (2)i of the orbifold scft, then the

fayet-iliopoulos parameters will correspond to t 1 and the -term to t 0. this is consistent with wittens
observation [29] that so(4)e symmetry of the linear sigma-model (one that rotates the is) corresponds
to the su (2)r of the orbifold scft.

15

gauge theory description of the full d1/d5 system.

the gauge theory relevant for understanding the low energy degrees of freedom of the

d1/d5 system is a 1+1 dimensional (4, 4) supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group
u(q1)  u(q5) [30, 31]. the matter content of this theory consists of hypermultiplets
in the adjoint representation of the two gauge groups u(q1) and u(q5) they can be

arranged as doublets under su(2)r of the gauge theory as

n (1)

aa =

4(aa) + iy (1)
y (1)
3(a a)
y (1)
2(aa)  iy (1)

 and n (5) =

4(bb) + iy (5)
y (5)

(33)

where a, a runs from 1, . . . , q1 and b, b runs from 1, . . . , q5. the n (1) transform as adjoints
of u(q1) and the n (5) transform as adjoints of u(q5). n (1) corresponds to massless
excitations of open strings joining the d1-branes among themselves and n (5) corresponds

to massless excitations of open strings joining d5-branes among themselves. this is

clear from the expression for the ns in terms of the y s. the y s appear from the
components of the gauge eld a along the compact directions of the four torus t 4. the
gauge theory also has hypermultiplets transforming as bi-fundamentals of u(q1)u(q5).
these hypermultiplets can be arranged as doublets of the su(2)r symmetry of the theory

as

the hypermultiplets arise from massless excitations of open strings joining the d1-branes

and the d5-branes. this gauge theory was analyzed in detail in [31]. motivated by the d-
brane description of the r4/z2 singularity we look for the degrees of freedom characterizing
the break up of (q1, q5) system to (q

5). physically the relevant degree
of freedom describing this process is the relative coordinate between the centre of mass of

1, q

5) and (q

the (q

values, thus making this degree of freedom becomes massive. this is consistent with the

fact that we are looking at the bound state (q1, q5).

consider the break up of the (q1, q5) bound state to the bound states (q

in order to address the above question we need to nd the low energy degrees of

the elds charged under ar are the hypermultiplets ab, ab, y (1)

thus the relevant degrees of freedom describing the splitting process is a 1 + 1 dimen-

sional u(1) gauge theory of ar with (4, 4) supersymmetry. the matter content of this
theory consists of hypermultiplets ab with charge +1 and ab with charge 1.

let us now describe the dynamics of the splitting process. this is given by analyzing

the hypermultiplet moduli space of the eective theory described above with the help of

the d-term equations:

aaba

ab  aa ba

ab  bbab

ba + bb ab

ba = 0
aabbba  aabbba = 0

(40)

in the above equations the sum over a, b, a, b is understood. these equations are
generalized version of (26) discussed for the r4/z2 singularity in section 4.1. at the

origin of the higgs branch where the classical moduli space meets the coulomb branch

this linear sigma model would ow to an infrared conformal eld theory which is singular.
the reason for this is the same as for the r4/z2 case. the linear sigma model contains

the following term in the superpotential

v = (aaba

ab + aaba

ab + bbab

ba + bbab

ba)(2

1 + 2

2 + 2

3 + 2
4)

(41)

as in the discussion of the r4/z2 case, at the origin of the hypermultiplet moduli space

the at direction of the coulomb branch leads to a ground state which is not normalizable.

19

this singularity can be avoided by deforming the d-term equations by the fayet-iliopoulos

terms:

aaba

ab  aaba

ba + bbab

ab  bbab
ba = r3
aabbba  aabbba = r1 + ir3

(42)

we note here that the fayet-iliopoulos terms break the relative u(1) under discussion and

the gauge eld becomes massive. the reason is that the d-terms with the fayet-iliopoulos

do not permit all a, bs in the above equation to simultaneously vanish. at least one of

them must be non-zero, but it is charged, therefore the u(1) is broken.

the singularity associated with the non-compact coulomb branch can also be avoided

by turning on the  term, the mechanism being similar to the one discussed in the previous

subsection. if any of the 3 fayet-iliopoulos d-terms or the  term is turned on, the at

directions of the coulomb branch are lifted, leading to normalizable ground state is of

the higgs branch. this prevents the breaking up of the (q1, q5) system to subsystems.
thus we see that the 4 parameters which resolve the singularity of the n = (4, 4) scft
on m make their appearance in the gauge theory as the fayet-iliopoulos terms and the
theta term.

it would be interesting to extract the singularity structure of the the gauge theory of

the d1/d5 system through mappings similar to (27)- (30).

4.3 the case (q1, q5)  (q1  1, q5) + (1, 0): splitting of 1 d1-

brane

it is illuminating to consider the special case in which 1 d1-brane splits o from the bound

state (q1, q5). the eective dynamics is again described in terms of a u(1) gauge theory

associated with the relative separation between the single d1-brane and the bound state
(q1  1, q5). the massless hypermultiplets charged under this u(1) correspond to open
strings joining the single d1-brane with the d5-branes and are denoted by

b =

ab
b
b



20

(43)

the d-term equations, with the fayet-iliopoulos terms, become in this case

abbb = r1 + ir2

(44)

while the potential is

q5xb=1(cid:16)|ab|2  |bb|2(cid:17) = r3,
v =

q5xb=1
q5xb=1(cid:16)|ab|2 + |bb|2(cid:17) (2

1 + 2

2 + 2

3 + 2
4)

(45)

the d-term equations above agree with those in [14] which discusses the splitting of a

single d1-brane. it is important to emphasize that the potential and the d-term equations
describe an eective dynamics in the classical background corresponding to the (q11, q5)
bound state. this corresponds to the description in [14] of the splitting process in an ads3

background which represents a mean eld of the above bound state.

5 hawking radiation and the resolutions of the orbifold

in this section we will address the question whether dynamical processes like absorption

and hawking radiation from the ve-dimensional black hole are aected by the presence of

the above moduli, especially the blow-up modes. for our understanding of such processes

to be complete, the supergravity calculation and the scft calculation of absorption

cross-section/hawking radiation rate should continue to agree even in the presence of

these moduli.

5.1 supergravity calculation of absorption/hawking radiation

in presence of moduli

we recall that the ve dimensional black hole solution in the absence of moduli is [1, 2]
obtained from the d1-d5 system by further compactifying x5 on a circle of radius r5 and

adding gravitational waves carrying left-(right-) moving momenta nl/r5 (nr/r5) along
x5. the near horizon geometry of this solution is [7, 8] btzs3  t 4 where the btz
black hole has mass m = (nr + nl)/l and angular momentum j = nl  nr

s q1q5/v4)1/4 is the radius of curvature of the btz black hole, v4 being the volume of the

the absorption cross-section of minimal scalars in the absence of moduli is given by

(46)

abs = 22r2

1r2
5


2

exp(/th)  1

(exp(/2tr)  1)(exp(/2tl)  1)

we will now show that the absorption cross-section remains unchanged even when the

moduli are turned on.

from the equations of motion of type ii supergravity [32], we can explicitly see that

the ve-dimensional einstein metric ds2
5,ein is not changed by turning on the sixteen
moduli corresponding to the metric gij on t 4 and the ramond-ramond 2-form potential
b. as regards the four blowing up moduli, the invariance of ds2

5,ein can be seen from
the fact that turning on these moduli corresponds to so(4, 5) transformation which is

part of a u-duality transformation and from the fact that the einstein metric does not

change under u-duality. this statement can be veried by using explicit construction of

the corresponding supergravity solution, at least for the bn s moduli [33]. now we know
that the minimal scalars i all satisfy the wave-equation

di = 0

(47)

where the laplacian is with respect to the einstein metric in ve dimensions. since it is

only this wave equation that determines the absorption cross-section completely, we see

that abs is the same as before.

it is straightforward to see that the hawking rate, given by

h = abs(e/th  1)1 d4k

(2)4

(48)

is also not changed.

5.2 scft calculation of absorption cross-section/hawking rate

in the presence of moduli

in section 3 we have listed the twenty (1,1) operators oi(z, z) in the scft based on the
symmetric product orbifold m which is dual to the d1/d5 system. in order to arrive at
the scft dual to the black hole, we have to rst implement the periodic identication
x5  x5 +2r5. it was shown in [8] that this forces the scft to be in the ramond sector.
turning on various moduli i of supergravity corresponds to perturbing the scft

s = s0 +xi z d2z ioi(z, z)

22

(49)

where i denote the near-horizon limits of the various moduli elds i.

finally, the kaluza-klein momentum of the black hole (equivalently, angular momen-

tum of btz) corresponds to excited states of this sector with

l0 = nl, l0 = nr

(50)

we note here that s0 corresponds to the free scft based on the symmetric product
orbifold m. since this scft is non-singular (all correlation functions are nite), it does
not correspond to the marginally stable bps solution originally found in [1, 2]. instead, it

corresponds to a ve-dimensional black hole solution in supergravity with suitable blow-

up moduli turned on.

let us now calculate the absorption cross-section of a supergravity uctuation i

using scft. the notation i implies that we are considering the supergravity eld to

be of the form

i = i

0 + 5i

(51)

where i

0 represents the background value. the factor of 5 above ensures appropriate
normalization of the uctuation i as explained below in the paragraph above (55). this

corresponds to the scft action

s = s0 +z d2z[ i

= s0 + sint

0 + 5 i]oi(z, z)

where

s0 = s0 +z d2z i
sint = 5z d2z ioi(z, z)

0oi(z, z)

(52)

(53)

(54)

the absorption cross-section of the supergravity uctuation i involves [34, 4, 12]

essentially the two-point function of the operator oi calculated with respect to the scft

action s0. since oi is a marginal operator, its two-point function is determined apart

from a normalization constant.

regarding the marginality of the operators oi, it is easy to establish it upto one-

loop order by direct computation (cijk = 0). the fact that these operators are exactly

23

marginal can be argued as follows. the twenty operators oi arise as top components of ve
chiral primaries. it is known that the number of chiral primaries with (jr, jr) = (m, n)
is the hodge number h2m,2n of the target space m of the scft. since this number
is a topological invariant, it should be the same at all points of the moduli space of

deformations.

in the case studied in [12] it was found that if the operator oi is canonically normal-

ized (ope has residue 1) and if i is canonically normalized in supergravity, then the

normalization of sint as in (54) ensures that abs from scft agrees with the supergravity

result. the crucial point now is the following: once we x the normalization of sint at a
given point in moduli space, at some other point it may acquire a constant (6= 1) in front
of the integral when oi and i are canonically normalized at the new point. this would

imply that abs will get multiplied by this constant, in turn implying disagreement with

supergravity. we need to show that that does not happen.

to start with a simple example, let us rst restrict to the moduli gij of the torus ft 4.

we have

(55)

(56)

(57)

s =z d2zxi xjgij

the factor of string tension has been absorbed in the denition of xi.

in [12] we had gij = ij + 5hij, leading to

s = s0 + sint

s0 = z d2zxi xjij
sint = 5z d2zxi xjhij

as we remarked above, this sint gives rise to the correctly normalized abs.

now, if we expand around some other metric

the above action (55) implies

gij = g0ij + 5hij

s = sg0 + sint

sg0 = z d2zxi xjg0ij

24

sint = 5z d2zxi xjhij

(58)

now the point is, neither hij nor the operator oij = x i x j in sint is canonically
normalized at gij = g0,ij. when we do use the canonically normalized operators, do we

pick up an additional constant in front?

note that

and

hoijoklig0 = gik

0 gjl

0 |z  w|4

hhij(x)hkl(y)ig0 = g0,ikg0,jld(x, y)

(59)

(60)

d(x, y) is the massless scalar propagator.

this shows that
statement (1):the two-point functions of oij and hij pick up inverse factors.

as a result, sint remains correctly normalized when re-written in terms of the canon-

ically normalized h and o, and no additional constant is picked up.

the above result is in fact valid in the full twenty dimensional moduli space fm because

statement (1) above remains true generally.

to see this, let us rst rephrase our result for the special case of the metric moduli

(55) in a more geometric way. the gijs can be regarded as some of the coordinates of the

moduli space fm (known to be a coset so(4, 5)/(so(4) so(5))). the innitesimal per-

turbations hij, hkl can be thought of as dening tangent vectors at the point g0,ij (namely

the vectors /gij, /gkl). the (residue of the) two-point function given by (59) denes

the inner product between these two tangent vectors according to the zamolodchikov

metric [35].

consider, on the other hand, the propagator (inverse two-point function) of hij, hkl

in supergravity. the moduli space action of low energy uctuations is nothing but the

supergravity action evaluated around the classical solutions g0,ij. the kinetic term of

such a moduli space action denes the metric of moduli space. the italicized statement

above is a simple reection of the fact that the zamolodchikov metric denes the metric

on moduli space, and hence

25

statement (2): the propagator of supergravity uctuations, viewed as a matrix, is the

inverse of the two-point functions in the scft.

the last statement is of course not specic to the moduli gij and is true of all the

moduli. we nd, therefore, that xing the normalization of sint (54) at any one point
0 ensures that the normalization remains correct at any other point 

0 by virtue of
statement (2). we should note in passing that statement (2) is consistent with, and

could have been derived from, ads/cft correspondence as applied to the two-point

function.

thus, we nd that abs is independent of the moduli, in agreement with the result

from supergravity.

5.3 entropy and area

we make a brief mention here of the fact that the correspondence between bekenstein-

hawking entropy and the scft entropy remains true in the presence of all the twenty

moduli. the reason is that in supergravity the einstein metric remains unchanged (see

section 5.1) and therefore the area of the event horizon remains the same (this can be

explicitly veried using the supergravity solution in [33]). in the scft, since the operators

corresponding to the above moduli are all exactly marginal (section 5.2) therefore the

central charge remains unchanged and hence, by cardys formula, the entropy does not

change, in agreement with the bekenstein-hawking formula.

6 conclusions

(a) we presented an explicit construction of all the marginal operators in the scft of the
d1/d5 system based on the orbifold m. these are twenty in number, four of which are
constructed using z2 twist operators and correspond to blowing up modes of the orbifold.
(b) we classied the the twenty near-horizon moduli of supergravity on ads3  s3  t 4
according to representations of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2)  so(4)i.
(c) we established one-to-one correspondence between the supergravity moduli and the

marginal operators by inventing a new so(4) symmetry in the scft which we identied

with the so(4)i of supergravity.

26

(d) we analyzed gauge theory dynamics of the d1/d5 system relevant for the splitting of
the bound state (q1, q5)  (q
(e) we showed in supergravity as well as in scft that the absorption cross-section

5) + (q

1, q

1, q

5).

for minimal scalars is the same for all values of the moduli, therefore establishing the

agreement between scft and supergravity all over the moduli space.

a the n = 4 superconformal algebra
to set up our notations and conventions we review the n = 4 superconformal algebra.
the algebra is generated by the stress energy tensor, four supersymmetry currents, and

a local su(2) r symmetry current. the operator product expansions of the algebra with

central charge c are given by (see for example [36].)

here t (z) is the stress energy tensor, ga(z), gb(z) the su(2) doublet of supersymmetry

generators and j i(z) the su(2) r symmetry current. the s stand for pauli matrices.

in the free eld realization desribed below, the above holomorphic currents occur together

with their antiholomorphic counterparts, which we will denote by ej(z), eg(z) and et (z).
in particular, the r-parity group will be denoted by su(2)r  gsu(2)r.
a free eld realization of the n = 4 superconformal algebra with c = 6q1q5 can be
constructed out of q1q5 copies of four real fermions and bosons. the generators are given

in addition to the local r symmetry the free eld realization of the n = 4 supercon-
formal algebra has additional global symmetries which can be used to classify the states.

we are interested in studying the states of the n = (4, 4) scft on m. the classication
of the states and their symmetry properties can be analyzed by studying the states of
a free eld realization of a n = (4, 4) scft on r4q1q5/s(q1q5). this is realized by
considering the holomorphic and the anti-holomorphic n = 4 superconformal algebra
with c = c = 6q1q5 constructed out of q1q5 copies of four real fermions and bosons. so

we have an anti-holomorphic component for each eld, generator and charges discussed

above. these are labelled by the same symbols used for the holomorphic components but

distinguished by a tilde.

the charges i1, i2 constructed above generate so(4) transformations only on the holo-

morphic bosons xa(z). similarly, we can construct charges ei1, ei2 which generate so(4)
transformations only on the antiholomorphic bosons gxa(z). normally one would expect
these charges to give rise to a global so(4)hol  so(4)antihol symmetry. however, the
kinetic term of the bosons in the free eld realization is not invariant under independent

holomorphic and antiholomorphic so(4) rotations. it is easy to see, for example by using

the noether procedure, that there is a residual so(4) symmetry generated by the charges

ji = i1 + ei1

eji = i2 + ei2

(72)

we will denote this symmetry as so(4)i = su(2)i  gsu(2)i, where the su(2) factors
are generated by ji, eji. these charges satisfy the property that (a) they correspond to
so(4) transformations of the bosons xa(z, z) = xa(z) + gxa(z) and (b) they fall into
representations of the n = (4, 4) algebra (as can be proved by using the commutation
relations (70) of the is). the bosons x(z, z) transform as (2, 2) under su(2)i  gsu(2)i.
b short multiplets of su (1, 1|2)
the supergroup su(1, 1|2) is the global part of the n = 4 superconformal algebra. the
representations of this supergroup are classied according to the conformal weight and

30

su(2)r quantum number. the highest weight states |hwi = |h, jr, j3
following properties

r = jri satisfy the

r |hwi = 0 j (3)

l1|hwi = 0 l0|hwi = h|hwi
r |hwi = jr|hwi
1/2|hwi = 0

1/2|hwi = 0 ga
ga

(73)

r

are the global charges of the currents t (z) and j (i)

where l,0, j (),(3)
r (z). the charges
ga
1/2,1/2 are the global charges of the supersymmetry currents ga(z) in the neveu-schwarz
sector. highest weight states which satisfy g2
1/2|hwi = 0 are chiral
primaries. they satisfy h = j. we will denote these states as |hwis. short multiplets are
generated from the chiral primaries through the action of the raising operators j, g1
and g2

1/2. the structure of the short multiplet is given below

1/2|hwi = 0, g1

(74)

the short multiplets of the supergroup su(1, 1|2) su(1, 1|2) are obtained by the tensor
product of the above multiplet. we denote the short multiplet of su(1, 1|2)  su(1, 1|2)
as (2h + 1, 2h + 1)s. these stand for the degeneracy of the bottom component, the top

row in (74). the top component of the short multiplet are the states belonging to the

last row in (74). the short multiplet (2, 2)s is special, it terminates at the middle row of
(74). for this case, the top component is the middle row. these states have h = h = 1

and transform as (1, 1) of su(2)r  gsu(2)r. there are 4 such states for each (2, 2)s.
