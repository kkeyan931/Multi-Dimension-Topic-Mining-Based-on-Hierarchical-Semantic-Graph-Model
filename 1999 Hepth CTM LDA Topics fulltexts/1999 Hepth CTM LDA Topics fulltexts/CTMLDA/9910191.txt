(1) indeed, two basic assumptions required. one hand, representation space possesses basis eigenstates |q > position operators q associated local coordinate system set-up conguration space , namely q|q >= q|q >. hand, representation space equipped hermitian positive denite inner product operators q p indeed self-adjoint. two assumptions, follows general conguration space representation heisenberg algebra momentum operator matrix elements given < q|p|q >= ih g1/4(q) q (cid:18) 1 g1/4(q) (n)(q q)(cid:19) + a(q)(n)(q q) , 1 pg(q) vanishing commutation relations  = 0 imply restriction a(q) a(q) q a(q) q = 0 , , = 1, 2, . . . , n . (2) (3) (4) relations, positive denite function g(q) species normalisation position eigenstates |q > < q|q >= (n)(q q) , variables a(q) corresponds local vector eld vanishing eld strength a(q) dened conguration space. 1 pg(q) 2 particular quantum states | > | >, conguration space wave function representations (q) < q| > (q) < q| > inner product given < | >= zm dnq qg(q) (q)(q) , position momentum operators realised dierential operators, < q|q| >= q(q) , < q|p| >= ih g1/4(q) (cid:20) q + h a(q)(cid:21) g1/4(q)(q) . (5) (6) two quantities g(q) a(q) thus parametrise possible representations heisen- berg algebra . however, representations necessarily unitarily inequi- valent. indeed, even though g(q) parametrises normalisation basis states |q > a(q) conguration space matrix elements momentum operators p, yet accounted freedom possible q-dependent phase redenition basis states, namely |q >(2)= ei(q)/h|q >. fact, local phase redenition tantamount local u(1) gauge transformation vector eld a(q) dened parametrisation p matrix elements, one nds a(2) (q) = a(q) + (q)/q. hence conclusion, variables a(q) vanishing eld strength determine u(1) bundle conguration space manifold , unitarily inequivalent representations heisenberg algebra thus classied terms gauge equivalence classes u(1) bundles . latter classes characterized u(1) holonomies around non contractible cycles , namely mapping rst homotopy group (or fundamental group) set gauge equivalence classes u(1) connections , characterized holonomies. particular manifold trivial homotopy group, namely simply connected one case n dimensional euclidean space, thus single representation heisenberg algebra, local u(1) unitary phase transformations conguration space. conclusion course corresponds von neumanns theorem real line, choosing trivial gauge conguration a(q) = 0 associated trivial homology class provides usual plane wave representation algebra. conclusion still leaves open interpretation normalisation factor g(q). (5), clear combination dnqpg(q) function determines integration measure . particular, integration measure chosen dieomorphic invariant coordinate reparametrizations , associated conguration space wave function representa- tion (q) =< q| > dieomorphic covariant, position momentum operators represented (6). equipped metric structure g(q), canonical choice g(q) = detg(q) indeed determines dieomorphic invariant integration measure, thereby leading nally dieomorphic covariant representations heisenberg algebra manifolds arbitrary topology geometry. immediate example curvilinear coordinates euclidean space, involved cases may course considered likewise manner. finally, condition self-adjoint momentum operators p requires associated wave function representation states dnq zm q (cid:20)qg(q) |(q)|2(cid:21) = 0 , = 1, 2, , n , (7) thereby implying restrictions states boundaries. given conguration space representation heisenberg algebra, also possible determine wave functions momentum eigenstates. however, possibility non trivial u(1) holonomies general case, network paths p (q0 q) connecting point 3 q given point q0 given path, set-up continuous fashion function q. done so, one introduces path-ordered u(1) holonomies  = p e hrp (q0q) dqa(q) , momentum eigenstate conguration space wave functions given by < q|p >= ei(q0,p) (2h)n/2  g1/4(q)h1/4(p) h (qq0)p e , (8) (9) (q0, p) arbitrary phase factor, function h(p) determines normalisation momentum eigenstates according < p|p >= (n)(p p) . (10) 1 ph(p) clearly, case trivial representation a(q) = 0, one recovers usual plane wave representation heisenberg algebra, extended include normalisation factors g(q) h(p) possibly dierent unity order ensure proper dieomorphic covariant properties case non cartesian coordinates . given dierent expressions, also becomes possible set-up phase space path integral representation matrix elements quantum operators, say conguration space. ensuing expressions identical usual ones discretized form, sole dierence appearing normalisation path dependency external states (see original reference details). general discussion representations heisenberg algebra conguration spaces arbitrary topology geometry displayed, simple matter apply given system whose dynamics determined action principle. based latter, canonical hamiltonian formulation system may developed, canonical quantisation leads certain quantum representation quantised system. case conguration space non trivial rst homotopy group, choice representation parametrised terms non trivial u(1) holonomies bundle around non contractible cycles matter physics, way example spin representation quantised system invariant space rotations matter physics. also level hamiltonian possible metric structure may appear thus determine adequate reparametrisation covariant representation heisenberg algebra used. finally, correspondence given classical hamiltonian, two parameter class hermitian (and possibly self-adjoint) quantum hamiltonian operators may introduced, reduce classical one limit h 0. again, developments left interested reader nd original reference. main point contribution wished emphasize general classication conguration space representations heisenberg algebra manifold arbitrary topology geometry terms topology gauge equivalence classes u(1) bundles manifold. 3 gauge invariant systems physical projector analysis hamiltonian formulation constrained systems goes back dirac general. here, simplest possible situation outlined explicitely, corresponding essentially systems gauge symmetries yang-mills type. moreover, shall also assume degrees freedom grassmann even variables thus commute classical level. 4 well known, system possesses continuous (global) symmetries, noethers the- orem exist conserved quantities generating symmetries, whose poisson brackets among one another also determine lie algebra symmetry group, poisson brackets hamiltonian system close among themselves. explicitely, h(q, p) denotes latter hamiltonian a(q, p) stand symmetry generators, one {a(q, p), b(q, p)} = cab cc(q, p) , {h(q, p), a(q, p)} = ca bb(q, p) . (11) here, cab however, coecients may phase space dependent quantities). b specic coecients assumed constants discussion (more generally c ca case local gauge symmetries, properties conserved quantities course preserved, addition, physical requirement gauge invariance implies conserved quantities must vanish identically, a(q, p) = 0, gauge invariant congurations. moreover, dynamics system phase space governed action principle (assuming (q, p) dene canonically conjugate degrees freedom) s = z tf ti dt  , (12) a(t) arbitrary lagrange multipliers gauge generator constraints = 0, also parametrise gauge freedom generated time evolution. particular, innites- imal gauge transformations correspond variations q = {q, aa} , p = {p, aa} , = + cbcbc bcb , (13) a(t) arbitrary innitesimal functions. within diracs quantisation systems, usual rules canonical quantisation simply applied phase space degrees freedom (q, p), leading priori representation algebras heisenberg type discussed previous section. restrictions gauge invariance imposed operator constraints time evolution generated time ordered operator a| >= 0 , s(tf , ti) = e ti hr tf dt . (14) (15) clearly, operator propagates gauge invariant well gauge variant states, thus cannot correspond physical propagator system physical, i.e. gauge invariant states would contribute. usually, order achieve aim, one considers gauge xing procedure gauge invariant congurations maintained actual time dependent dynamics. gauge xing may eected quantisation, namely so-called faddeev reduced phase space approach. else, gauge xing eected so-called brst quantisation gauge invariant system, case original phase space extended include degrees freedomnamely ghostsof grassmann parity opposite original degrees freedom, order compensate contributions gauge variant congurations degrees freedom conjugate lagrange multipliers also introduced order render dynamical well. however, whatever approach gauge xing implemented, even though ensuing description construction indeed always gauge invariant, may generally suer gribov problems, namely may include gauge invariant congurations once, case may be, clearly 5 unacceptable situation one properly include physically distinct congurations possibly accessible system. nevertheless, gribov problems consequence gauge xing, latter may circumvented, gribov problems would simply issue anymore. recently proposed physical projector approach quantisation constrained systems indeed provides framework avoids apparent necessity gauge xing, ensuring proper inclusion physically distinct congurations thus avoiding gribov problems altogether. fact, physical projector approach simply set within diracs formulation briey described above, uses projector onto gauge invariant components quantum state quantised system. projector obtained integrating group gauge transfor- mations transformations states generated gauge generators a, e = z du (a)e h . (16) here, coordinates group manifold, du (a) group invariant integration measure normalised e indeed obeys properties projection operator, e 2 = e , e = e . (17) case compact gauge group, denition e sucient. gauge group non compact, thereby leading spectrum gauge generators purely discrete, considerations need applied. given physical projector e, denition physical evolution operator propagating gauge invariant states clearly, sphys(tf , ti) = e s(tf , ti)e = e h (tf ti) h e = e e h e e , (18) making explicit indeed gauge invariant states contribute operator external states well intermediate ones. particular, case compact lie group gauge transformations, implicitely assumed discussion taken structure c constants, clear evaluation matrix elements physical coecients cab operator, physical projector itself, immediately implies group theory techniques calculation various group invariants. remainder contribution, dierent examples application physical projector quantisation gauge invariant systems briey described. 4 quantum mechanical gauge invariant systems one simplest examples quantum mechanical systems possessing local gauge invariance so(2)=u(1) local gauge invariance plane dening two degrees freedom. however, situation far simple itself, invariance time dependent so(2) rotations may coupled translations direction perpendicular plane rotations, thereby leading nally system three degrees freedom cartesian coordinates (x(t), y(t), z(t)), whose dynamics governed lagrange function, l = 1 2 h( x + gy)2 + ( gx)2 + ( z )2i v (qx2 + y2) . (19) here, (t) gauge degree freedom, g gauge coupling constant, potential v (px2 + y2) rotation invariant quantity later purposes taken spherically symmetric harmonic potential v = 2(x2 + y2)/2. 6 since gauge transformations system correspond time dependent so(2) rotations (x(t), y(t)) coupled time dependent translations z(t), clear generator local abelian gauge symmetry given = pz + gp , (20) pz momentum conjugate coordinate z p conjugate angular variable associated polar coordinates (r, ) (x, y) plane. similarly, gauge invariant hamiltonian system simply reads, h = 1 2 p2 r + 1 2r2 p2 + 1 2 p2 z + 1 2 2r2 , (21) clearly vanishing poisson bracket gauge generator , since variables (r, pr), (, p) (z, pz) form pair canonically conjugate phase space degrees freedom. canonical quantisation system straighforward enough, best developed helicity basis related so(2) symmetry (x, y) plane. given creation annihilation operators a() x,y associated cartesian coordinates (x, y) usual way, helicity creation annihilation operators dened = 1 2  , = 1 2ha yi x ia . (22) one nds h = 1 2 p2 z + hha +a+ + ai , = pz + hgha +a+ ai . (23) expressions make obvious physical spectrum system is, construct associated quantum excitations fock vacuum. particular, working conguration space representation heisenberg algebra associated polar coordinates (r, , z), straightforward determine wave functions gauge invariant states{$9909033$}. example, physical energy spectrum thus given en = 1 2 p2 + h(n+ + n + 1) , p = hg(n+ n) , (24) n course integer excitation numbers modes left- right-handed so(2) helicity. present system, spectrum gauge generator continuous (because pz contribution), denition physical projector requires rst consider projector e onto states whose eigenvalue lies within interval , > 0 positive number taken small may required. operator e0 projecting onto states = 0 obtained as e0 = lim 0 h e = z + h e .

(29) hand, two degrees freedom dene fact phase space system, particular commutation relations  = h 2nk . (30) hence system distinguished phase space compact 2-torus volume (2)2, quite unique feature directly amenable usual quantisation techniques. moreover, commutation relation shows number physical states must also given (2)2/(2h/(2nk)) = 4nk/h, rst indication factor nk indeed needs quantised quantum level (nk > 0 assumed; nk negative, roles coordinates x1 x2 interchanged). coherent state quantisation system requires structure introduced beyond mere topological dieomorphic ones, namely complex structure parametrised complex parameter = 1 + i2 2 > 0. associated annihilation creation operators dened = nk h2 hi a1 + a2i , = nk h2 hi a1 a2i . (31) restricted considerations zero mode sector alone, construction physical projector relates large gauge transformations acting zero modes only. gauge transformations (29), projector found{$9909221$} given e = p+ k1,k2= u (k1, k2) u (k1, k2) = c(k1, k2)exp( 2i h hnk 2 h( k1 k2) + ( k1 k2)i) . (32) 9 here, c(k1, k2) cocyle factor group composition law obeyed operator representation large gauge transformations. latter requirement implies that{$9909221$} c(k1, k2) = eikk1k2 , nk = h 4 k , (33) k arbitrary strictly positive integer, hence also equal number physical states. within coherent state representation system, possible determine physical spectrum content well coherent state wave functions gauge invariant states, simple application physical projector onto space quantum states. explicit analysis{$9909221$} nds number physical states indeed equal integer k quantises normalisation factor nk, obtained wave functions agree completely results established previously literature (see original references explicit expressions). construction, physical states |r > (r = 0, 1, , k 1) gauge invari- ant large gauge transformations. however, extent dependency complex structure torus arises also needs assessed. explicit analysis issue nds requirement modular invariance parameter implies integer k must also even, whole set physical states provides single irreducible representation modular group riemann surface . thus topological invariance original classical theory characterized quantum level. dependency complex structure modular classes consequence conformal anomaly quantised system. 6 conclusions mentioned introduction, purpose contribution highlight recent results concerned issues raised canonical quantisation systems whose conguration space euclidean parametrized curvilinear coordinates, systems possessing local gauge invariances. general classication representations heisenberg algebra rst case briey described, implies appearance topology classes u(1) bundles conguration space, together dieomophic covariant wave function representation quantum states. respect gauge invariant systems, new approach quantisation discussed, shown explicit examples lead perfectly adequate framework avoiding gauge xing thereby also possibility gribov problems. advantages physical projector approach emphasized however, example fact also apt address issues raised quantisation compact phase spaces isometries, illustrated u(1) chern-simons theory example. next stage explorations based physical projector initiated, aiming towards deeper insight non perturbative dynamics theories ever closer actual material universe quantum excitations, whether within realm quantum eld theories inceptions instigated recent developments string m-theory. acknowledgements prof. j.r. klauder gratefully acknowledged many useful discussions years, constant interest work. prof. m.n. hounkonnou thanked insistence getting contribution written form, importantly initiative organization workshop, hopefully rst long series meetings ever increasing purposefulness interest. 10 references  detailed discussion
