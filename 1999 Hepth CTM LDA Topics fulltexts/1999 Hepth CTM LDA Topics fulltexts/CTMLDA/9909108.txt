specifying specic action bundle connection implicitly denes orbifold wilson line. words, orbifold wilson lines precisely choices actions bundle connection. shall show that, similarly, discrete torsion choice action (1-)gerbe connection. technically, specifying lift bundle, gerbe, known specifying 4 equivariant structure bundle gerbe. thus, paper shall often speak classifying equivariant structures, means classifying lifts . results restricted trivial gerbes words, description discrete torsion applies equally well compactications nontrivial h-eld strengths. also, make assumptions concerning nature matter whether abelian nonabelian. also matter whether acts freely underlying topological space description, freely-acting orbifolds understood precisely way orbifolds xed points. also able describe analogues discrete torsion type iia rr 1-form iib rr 2-form elds. addition, approach makes clear exist analogues discrete torsion tensor elds appearing supergravity theories. describe specic program rigorously deriving analogues discrete torsion many type ii tensor eld potentials (specically, understood terms gerbes), conjecture results analogues discrete torsion p-form elds measured h p(, u(1)), orbifold group. begin section 2 reviewing orbifold wilson lines language easily generalize. specically, describe orbifold wilson lines ambiguity lifting action orbifold group bundle connection. section 3 give basic discussion n-gerbes, describing used understand many tensor eld potentials appearing supergravity theories. discussion necessary shall describe discrete torsion precise analogue orbifold u(1) wilson lines 1- gerbes. section 4 outline precisely one derive discrete torsion ambiguity specifying action orbifold group 1-gerbe connection, words, analogue orbifold wilson lines. give rigorous derivation discrete torsion paper; see instead {$9909120$}. finally, include appendix group cohomology, used great deal paper may familiar reader. paper concentrate developing degree physical intuition results discrete torsion, give simplied (and rather loose) derivations. rigorous derivation results 1-gerbes, together detailed description 1-gerbes, provided separate paper {$9909120$}. remark purpose writing paper {$9909120$} primarily con- ceptual, rather computational, nature. papers give new conceptual understanding discrete torsion. along way provide fringe benets, understanding orbifold wilson lines nontrivial bundles, description discrete torsion backgrounds nontrivial torsion1, thorough pedagogical review 1-gerbes terms sheaves categories. however, provide signicant new computational methods. 1torsion sense of, nontrivial 3-form curvature, opposed mathematical senses. 5 mention issues concerning discrete torsion shall address either paper {$9909120$}. first, shall discuss discrete torsion orbifold singularities. one might wonder discrete torsion, close analogue, dened non-orbifold singularities, conifold singularities; shall address matter here. second, shall attempt discuss turning discrete torsion alters moduli space structure, i.e., discrete torsion changes allowed resolutions singularities. see instead {$9409188$} preliminary discussion matter. matters discussed . also mention earlier version paper, made slightly stronger claim appears here. namely, earlier versions paper claimed dierence two equivariant structures 1-gerbe connection dened element h 2(, u(1)). however, since corrected minor error {$9909120$}. here, claim dierence equivariant structures element group includes h 2(, u(1)) words, additional degrees freedom missed previously. additional degrees freedom discussed detail . 2 orbifold wilson lines shall begin making close examination principal bundles heterotic string orbifolds, order carefully review notion orbifold wilson line. next section, describe gerbes, provide generalization line bundles required describe higher rank tensor potentials supergravity theories. given basic description gerbes, shall describe notion orbifold wilson line generalizes case gerbes, process, recover discrete torsion (and analogues tensor potentials appearing supergravity theories) precise analogue orbifold wilson line gerbe. let x smooth manifold, discrete group acting dieomorphisms x. section shall discuss extend action bundle x connection bundle. shall explicitly recover, example, orbifold wilson lines crop toroidal heterotic orbifolds. next section shall generalize methods describe discrete torsion analogue orbifold wilson lines higher-degree gerbes. 6 2.1 basics orbifold wilson lines begin discussing orbifold wilson lines mathematical detail, shall take moment discuss generality. point paper always assume gauge bundles question abelian; is, principal g-bundle appearing implicitly explicitly abelian g. constructing heterotic orbifolds, people often mention orbifold wilson lines. they? constructing heterotic toroidal orbifold, one combine action x gauge transformation, create wilson lines quotient space. action gauge bundle denes lift bundle. wilson lines typically called orbifold wilson lines. simple description works precisely case bundle orbifolded trivial. case, canonical (in fact, trivial) lift leaves bers invariant, lift described combining gauge transformation action base. general, bundle nontrivial, canonical lift, one work harder. specication lift bundle known technically choice equivariant structure bundle, derive orbifold wilson lines general context speak classifying equivariant structures. shall study equivariant structures much detail next subsection. remainder subsection, shall attempt give intuition relevant ideas. consider simplicity special case orbifold group acting freely (without xed points) space x. precisely describe wilson line quotient space? let x x, pick path x g x g . essence, wilson loop quotient space x/ composition (nonclosed) wilson loop along path x g x gauge transformation describing action g corresponding principal bundle. clear description equivariant structures bundle encoding information wilson lines quotient space, among things. reason, choices equivariant structures often called orbifold wilson lines. orbifold wilson lines classied? again, simplicity assume acts freely x. shall examine connections quotient space related connections cover, order shed light. (in later sections shall assume bundles consideration admit connections; make assumption order perform enlightening calculation.) first, recall g, moduli space g-connections x/, abelian g, given g acts conjugation. abelian g, conjugation acts trivially, moduli hom (1(x/), g) /g 7 space g-connections x/ simply hom (1(x/), g) thus, order study orbifold wilson lines x, need understand 1(x/) related 1(x). assuming discrete x connected, long exact sequence homotopy2 nd short exact sequence 0 1(x) 1(x/) 0() 0 1(x/) extension 0() = 1(x). 1(x/) receives contribution , see orbifolding enhances space possible wilson lines hom(, g), roughly speaking. precisely, long exact sequence 0 hom(, g) hom (1(x/), g) hom (1(x), g) example, special case g = u(1), short exact sequence3 0 h 1(, u(1)) hom (1(x/), u(1)) hom (1(x), u(1)) 0 h 1(, u(1)) denotes group cohomology trivial action coecients u(1). thus, see explicitly discrete freely-acting, u(1)-connections quotient space pick contribution group cohomology group h 1(, u(1)), identify orbifold u(1) wilson lines. results discussion important bear repeating. argued that, discrete freely-acting, u(1) connections quotient get contri- bution h 1(, u(1)). shall argue later sections general abelian g general discrete (not necessarily freely-acting), orbifold g wilson lines classied h 1(, g), h 1(, g) denotes group cohomology , coecients4 g. later sections shall also make assumptions concerning nature bundle shall assume bundle question admits connections. shall rigorously de- rive classication orbifold wilson lines classication equivariant structures principal bundles connection. classify equivariant structures gerbes connection5, shall recover classication includes h 2(, u(1)). point shall take moment clarify issue may puzzling reader. claimed introduction would describe discrete torsion terms 2applied principal bundle x x/ whose existence follows fact acts freely. 3using fact u (1) = r/z injective z-module . 4technically, also assuming action coecients g trivial. shall make assumption group cohomology throughout paper. 5and band c(u (1)), technically. 8 orbifold wilson lines b elds. however, discrete torsion measured terms group cohomology, whereas (for connections) wilson lines given hom(1, g)/g. however, special case g = u(1), hom (1, g) /g = h 1(, u(1)) h 1(, u(1)) group cohomology. clear reader usual classication discrete torsion given h 2(, u(1)) quite similar formal classication orbifold u(1) wilson lines given h 1(, u(1)). particular, reader less surprised orbifold wilson lines discrete torsion related. one issue glossed far concerns fake wilson lines, shall take moment discuss. consider example orbifold c2/z2. space simply- connected, yet usual prescriptions orbifold wilson lines tell us physical degree freedom (given hom(z2, g)) would usually associate wilson lines. degrees freedom often referred fake wilson lines {$9409188$}. degree freedom fact physical unphysical artifact. next sections shall see mathematically one recover degrees freedom measured h 1(, g) = hom(, g) -orbifolds spaces g-bundles (with g abelian), regardless whether freely acting. precisely fake wilson lines interpreted quotient space? shown  one quotients total spaces bundles, using equivariant structures dening fake wilson lines, resulting object quotient space ber bundle. (for example, z2 orbifold rank n complex vector bundle c2 nontrivial orbifold wilson lines ber bundle quotient space c2/z2 one gets object whose ber points cn, appropriate rank n vector bundle, whose ber singularity cn/z2.) pursued question depth, strong suspicion. case x/ algebraic variety6, possible construct (reexive) sheaves closely related to, quite as, bundles. example, c2/z2, addition line bundles also reexive rank 1 sheaves. nd tempting conjecture reexive rank 1 sheaves correspond quotients equivariant line bundles c2 nontrivial fake wilson lines, generally, fake wilson lines quotient spaces algebraic varieties interpretation terms reexive sheaves locally free. moreover, isomorphism classes reexive sheaves ane spaces c2/ classied way orbifold wilson lines , fact forms one corner celebrated mckay correspondence. shall nothing say matter paper. 6 technically, noetherian normal variety. 9 move discuss lifts acting line bundles connection, shall discuss amusing technical points regarding equivariant bundles. one natural question ask following: given equivariant structure bundle p , one compute characteristic classes quotient bundle p/? basic idea construct principle g-bundle e x, projection x/ yields quotient bundle. shall work details here; see instead {$9503208$}, program pursued detail. principle one could follow program equivariant gerbes shall construct later sections, discuss equivariant characteristic classes. however, shall pursue direction paper. passing also note rare occasions, equivariant bundles equivariant bundles connection discussed physics literature terms v-bundles . language v-bundles rather dierent language shall use paper describe orbifold wilson lines, though technically equivalent. 2.2 equivariant bundles let p principal g-bundle x abelian lie group g (e.g., g = u(1)n positive n). given action x, would like study lifts action x total space p . precisely lift action ? let : p x denote projection, lift action element g dieomorphism g : p p g morphism principal g-bundles. statement g morphism bundles means precisely following diagram commutes: p x g p (1) g x statement g morphism principal g-bundles, merely morphism bundles, means that, addition commutativity diagram above, action g total space must commute g. words, g(h p) = h g(p) h g p p . furthermore, order lift action entire group elements, shall impose constraint g1, g2 . gg1 g2 = g1 g2 (2) constraint given equation (2) quite important; one always guaranteed nding lifts satisfy (2). example7, shall examine nontrivial z2 bundle 7we would like thank a. knutson pointing example us. 10 s1. consider group = z2 acts base s1 half-rotation circle. total space nontrivial z2 bundle, essentially 720 object, must act rotation either +180 180, order cover action base s1 (i.e., order diagram (1) commute). unfortunately, neither action total space bundle squares identity, equation (2) satised case. example given demonstrates, although trivial bundles admit lifts orbifold group actions, nontrivial bundles admit lifts orbifold group actions. rather digress explain conditions existence lifts, shall simply assume lifts exist examples considered paper. (we shall make similar assumption discussing equivariant gerbes.) lift action bundle also called choice (-)equivariant structure bundle. passing, also mention instead speaking lifts, could equivalently work terms pullbacks. loosely speaking, terms pullbacks, bundle p almost equivariantizable respect action if, g , g p = p . above, bundles necessarily equivariant respect given , shall discuss relevant constraints paper. precisely, equivariant bundle p dened bundle choice equivariant structure, dened specic set isomorphisms g : g p p g , subject obvious analogue equation (2). easy check denitions equivariant structures terms lifts terms pullbacks equivalent. completeness, shall outline argument here. let g : g p p dene equivariant structure (in terms pullbacks) principal bundle p . then, dene lift g g as, g = g1 (g1). reader easily check g indeed dene lift g, dened above. conversely, given lift g g , dene equivariant structure (in terms pullbacks) g : g p p by, 1 g = g g. easy check two constructions given inverses one another. many possible lifts action given g exist? given one lift, certainly make lift composing action lift gauge transformation. precisely, given set lifts {g|g }, construct new set lifts {g } composing g gauge transformation g : x g g2(x) g1(g1 2 x) = g2g1(x) x x. moreover, two lifts dier set gauge transformations. rephrase saying two lifts action p dier element hom(, c (g)) = h 1(, c (g)). now, knowledge orbifold wilson lines, eventually want (equiva- lence classes of) lifts classied h 1(, g) = hom(, g), h 1(, c (g)). forgotten? far studied extend action total space bundle. 11 yet spoken requiring action preserve connection bundle. requirement place additional constraints lifts. done, see considering lifts action line bundles connection, instead line bundles, recover classication h 1(, g), desired. information equivariant bundles, see example . 2.3 equivariant bundles connection previous subsection described action group principal g-bundles, g abelian lie group. section shall extend discussion include consideration connection bundle. shall argue equivalence classes lifts action pairs (line bundle, connection) classied group cohomology group h 1(, g). (more precisely, shall nd non-canonical correspondence equivariant structures principal g-bundles connection elements h 1(, g). special cases, trivial principal g-bundles, canonical correspondence.) information connection-preserving lifts, see8 {$9503208$} . going on, shall take moment briey review connections principal bundles means lift preserve connection. one way think connection bundle set gauge elds a, one element good cover base. however, slightly elegant description shall use instead . p total space principal g-bundle x, connection p map p lie g, (lie g)-valued 1-form p , satisfying certain properties shall describe (see instead, example,  ). given open set u x p |u trivial, let : u p section, let denote connection p , i.e., corresponding (lie g)-valued 1-form, recover gauge eld base x s. two distinct sections s1, s2 : u p dene 2 (dg)g1. : x g gauge elds diering gauge transformation, i.e., denes gauge transformation, acts connection (, ) 1 = (p) ((p)) (p) 1((p)) ln( )(p) p p : p x projection. clearly, gauge transformation : x g 8there also related information  . references analyze distinct related problem; discussion might rst confuse reader. specically, instead considering representations group connection-preserving lifts dieomorphisms base, study space connection-preserving lifts itself, argue central extension group bundle-with-connection-preserving dieomorphisms base u (1), principal u (1)-bundles. reader might tempted argue lifts classied h 2(, u (1)), quite correct. particular, viewing set connection-preserving lifts central extension, elements project not, general, form representation , i.e., satisfy equation (2). 12 preserve connection (not gauge equivalence) constant map. morphism principal bundles act connection? let : p1 p2 denote morphism principal bundles, 2 connection p2, 2 (dened obvious way) connection p1. relevantly problem discussion, g g denotes lift g, shall say g preserves connection g = , gauge transformation. order get well-dened connection living quotient x/, shall demand lift action preserves connection itself, gauge-equivalence class. (if case, would able immediately write well-dened connection quotient space.) phrased another way, lift action x yield well-dened connection quotient precisely deformed element h 1(, c (g)) preserves connection itself, gauge- equivalence class. phrased another way still, merely demanded lift preserve gauge-equivalence class connection, naively spoke gauge- equivalence class descending quotient, would guaranteed nding representatives quotiented gauge-equivalence class. necessary sucient conditions lift preserve connection known easy describe {$9409188$}. fact, action g base x liftable map bundle connection action g preserves values9 wilson loops base . (note even bundles non-at connection nontrivial bundles one still dene wilson loops however, special case connection value wilson loop depend homotopy class loop.) reader surprised result, fact often implicitly claimed literature toroidal heterotic orbifolds, example. now, many lifts preserve connection itself? let {g} denote lift {g } preserves connection itself. compose {g} element h 1(, c (g)) get another lift, constant elements, namely h 1(, g) h 1(, c (g)), act preserve connection itself. thus, h 1(, g) acts set connection- preserving lifts , clear action transitive free. note special case equivariant bundle x trivial, (distinguished) trivial lift, canonical correspondence elements h 1(, g) connection-preserving lifts. general bundles, distinguished lift. result important, shall repeat it. shown (-)equivariant structures g-bundles connection (noncanonically) identied elements 9strictly speaking, preserves values wilson loops conjugation; however, bundles abelian structure group, conjugation acts trivially. 13 h 1(, g). special cases, trivial bundles, canonical identication. passing, note analysis equivariant structures bundles connection assume freely-acting abelian: analysis applies equally well cases xed points base space, well cases nonabelian. 2.4 example: heterotic orbifolds explicit example, let us consider dene toroidal heterotic orbifold. principal g bundle (for g) torus, simplicity shall assume trivial10. shall also assume connection bundle torus merely at, actually trivial. special circumstances, dieomorphism base lifts action bundle. now, dene lift action torus total space principal bundle trivial. since total space trivial principal bundle x g, clearly lift action total space dening trivial ber g. (more generally, nontrivial bundle, demanding group lift action total space bundle trivial. depending upon x bundle question, often obstructions.) given one lift, nd possible lifts simply composing trivial lift gauge transformation. order get well-dened connection quotient space, however, constraints possible lifts. first, note special circumstances, describe lift composition trivial lift gauge transformation. g , let g : x g denote corresponding gauge transformation. order preserve connection itself, g must constant, words, g = (g) : g. (g) dene usual orbifold wilson lines. 2.5 discussion terms cech cohomology eventually paper work arguments closely analogous derive analogues orbifold wilson lines gerbes. order properly some- dicult time-consuming (1-)gerbes properly described terms sheaves categories, full analysis somewhat lengthy. order give general intuition results level hitchins  discussion gerbes, eventu- ally give rather loose derivation results terms cech cohomology. (a rigorous 10although bundle connection, need topologically trivial even trivializable stronger constraint necessary, introducing order keep warm-up example simple. 14 derivation appear {$9909120$}.) warm-up eventual discussion, section shall briey describe one re-derive orbifold wilson lines working level cech cohomol- ogy, i.e., level transition functions bundles. feel approach philosophically somewhat awed transition functions bundle really cap- ture information bundle. example, gauge transformations bundle completely invisible level transition functions. thus, nd notion dening equivariant structure bundle putting equivariant structure transition functions completely satisfying. thus, study equivariant gerbes, shall limit discussing equivariant structures gerbe transition functions, shall also discuss equivariant structures gerbes themselves. experts note subsection implicitly make assumptions regarding behavior bundle trivializations action orbifold group. purpose subsection give rigorous derivation merely perform enlightening calculation, shall gloss issues. let p principal g-bundle manifold x, let group acting x dieomorphisms. let {u} good invariant cover x, means u invariant , u disjoint union contractible open sets. example, one often get good invariant covers space x good covers quotient x/. note good invariant cover good cover, general. shall assume good invariant covers exist subsection, though clear need true general. (again, purpose subsection present enlightening calculations plausibility arguments, completely rigorous proofs.) let h denote transition functions bundle p . assume p equivariant structure, level transition functions means g exist functions g : u g g h ( = h g ) = g h (g )1 (3) functions g local trivialization realizations isomorphism principal g-bundles g : p g p g . clear g = (g)1 g dened section equivariant bundles. g partially specify equivariant structure p , also need little information. particular, must also demand g1, g2 , g2 g 2g1 = g1g2 (4) note appropriate cech version equation (2). now, suppose g g dene two distinct equivariant structures p , respect 15 group . dene g : u u(1) by, g g g fact g fact g must satisfy equation (3), immediately derive = g g u = u u, g dene function g : x u(1). gauge transformation describing dierence two equivariant structures. almost, quite, gauge transformation g described section equivariant bundles. equation (4), see g must obey g2 g 2g1 = g1g2 thus, two equivariant structures p dier element h 1(, c (g)), described section equivariant bundles. shall recover fact equivariant structures bundles connection dier elements h 1(, g), abelian g. let (lie g)-valued one-form open set u, dening connection p . words, overlaps u = u u, = ln h action g , since know g = + ln g g h = g h (g )1 see g dene two distinct equivariant structures transition functions, must g constant, order g well- dened. thus, recover fact g constant, subset h 1(, c (g)) describes equivariant bundles connection given h 1(, g), claimed. g /g essence, using form equivariant cech cohomology. mathematics literature seems contain multiple11 versions equivariant cech cohomology, unfortunately none quite adequate eventual needs (i.e., none correspond precise way set equivariant structures gerbes), shall speak further. 11one version equivariant cech cohomology described . another version described  . 16 3 n-gerbes discrete torsion long associated two-form b-elds supergravity theories. reader surprised, therefore, deep understanding discrete torsion hinges deep understanding two-form b elds. shall argue b elds understood connections 1-gerbes, discrete torsion arises lifting action orbifold group 1-gerbe connection. might one want new mathematical object describe b-elds type ii string theory? reason dilemma doubt puzzled many years. torsion12 h dened h = db. long h taken cohomologically trivial, certainly sensible denition. unfortunately, general one often wants speak h cohomologically trivial element h 3(r). case, relation h = db hold locally.
