abstract

radiative corrections arising from the axial coupling of charged fermions to a constant
vector b can induce a lorentz- and cpt-violating chern-simons term in the qed
action. we calculate the exact one-loop correction to this term keeping the full b
dependence, and show that in the physically interesting cases it coincides with the
lowest-order result. the eect of regularization and renormalization and the implica-
tions of the result are briey discussed.

the possible breaking of cpt and lorentz invariance due to non-conventional
physics has been recently addressed by constructing extensions of the standard model
that include tiny non-invariant renormalizable terms (see ref.[1, 2, 3] and references
therein). in particular, it is interesting to consider the qed sector of such extensions.
we shall only be concerned here with the lorentz-violating cpt-odd terms, which for
a single charged (dirac) fermion read

s cpt = z d4x(cid:20)a   b5 +

stringent experimental bounds can be put on the pure-photon cpt-violating term [4],
which is of the chern-simons form [5] (a disputed claim exists, however, for a nonzero
~k [6, 7]). moreover, this term can generate a negative contribution to the energy that
can introduce an instability in the theory [4]. hence, both experiment and theory
suggest that k should vanish. a natural question is then whether a non-zero k can
be induced by radiative corrections involving lorentz and cpt-violating couplings in
other sectors of the total low-energy theory. in that case, the tight bounds on k would
also constrain these sectors. in the qed extension such corrections can only arise from
the axial-vector term, with coupling b.

several authors have tried to answer this question. all calculations have been
performed to one loop and at leading order in b, and have rendered a nite result.
however, despite some early claims of denite values for the induced k [2, 8], it seems
quite clear now that the result is ambiguous [1, 9, 10, 11], i.e., depends on the details of
the high-energy theory [12]. it is our purpose here to calculate the one-loop corrections
1 and discuss the relevant issues in the light of the exact
to all orders in the coupling b
result.

the relevant quantity is the parity-odd part of the vacuum polarization, which

must be of the form


odd(p) = bpk(p, b, m),

(2)

where p is the external momentum and the function k is a scalar. the contribution
to the induced chern-simons term in the eective action is given by

(k) =

1
2

bk(0, b, m) ,

(3)

and must be a function of b2/m2. to one-loop, the only contributing diagram coincides
with the standard one-loop vacuum-polarization but with the usual fermion propagator
replaced by the b-exact propagator

sb(k) =

i

6 k  m  6 b5

.

(4)

we use a hermitian 5 with tr{5} = 4i and g = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).
in order to keep the full dependence on b we must rationalize this propagator. we
nd

sb(k) = i

.

(5)

(6 k + m  6 b5)(k2  m2  b2 + [6 k, 6 b]5)

(k2  m2  b2)2 + 4(k2b2  (k  b)2)

1when this work was being completed a paper by c.d. fosco and j.c. le guillou pursuing the
same aim appeared [13]. however, their result disagrees with the one we present here, except in the
massless-fermion case. in their calculation of the massive case, logarithmic divergences appear which
are responsible for non-analytic corrections to the eective action. such corrections would invalidate
previous (perturbative) calculations. in fact, there seems to be an algebraic mistake in their derivation
of the exact rationalized propagator, for it does not give unity when multiplied by the kinetic term.
nontheless, their non-perturbative calculation of the radiative corrections in the massless case is correct,
and we actually use it as a conrmation of our corresponding result.

2

note that if b is space-like and |b2| > m2, this propagator has not the pole structure
of usual propagators: the poles are not on the k0 real axis but lie on the k0 imaginary
axis. the one-loop vacuum polarization reads

 (p) = z d4k

(2)4 tr {sb(k) sb(k  p)} .

(6)

this integral seems to be linearly divergent, but, as we shall see, the divergent terms
cancel. eq. 5 allows us to compute the trace in the numerator, which for the odd terms
in b reduces to pf(k, p, b, m), with

f(k, p, b, m) = bf (1)

 (k, p, b, m) + kf (2)

 (k, p, b, m)

=  4inbh2m2(k2  m2  b2) + (k2 + m2 + b2)((k  p)2  m2 + b2) + 4k  b(k  p)  bi

 2kh(k2  m2 + b2)(k  p)  b + ((k  p)2  m2 + b2)k  bio .

(7)

the linearly divergent term has disappeared, leaving an integral which is just loga-
rithmically divergent by power counting. since we are only interested in k(p, b, m) for
p = 0 and, luckily, no term with bk appears, we can simplify the calculation by
setting p = 0 in f(k, p, b, m) and in the denominator of the integral. we are then left
with two integrals which only depend on b and m. the rst one is already of the form
bk1(0, b, m) . the second integral must also give a result of the form bk2(0, b, m),
and k2(0, b, m) can be calculated multiplying the integral by b and dividing by b2. in
this way, we arrive at the following expression:

k(0, b, m) = 4iz d4k

in order to calculate this integral using spherical coordinates, we go to euclidean space
via a wick rotation of the time component of both k and b and get

which gives a vanishing result if the integral is done symmetrically. the other terms are
power-counting nite. this also shows an ambiguity in the induced term: the integral of
the expression (10) is regularization dependent! we shall further discuss this issue later
on. now, as promised, let us write eq. (9) in (four-dimensional) spherical coordinates:

this double integral can be carried out in dierent ways (including numerical integra-
tion), which are equivalent as long as spherical symmetry is preserved. the simplest
one is to do rst the angular integral:

(12)

this integral is well-behaved for large |ke|. note the appearance of the sign function,
coming from the mentioned pole structure of the propagator. for m 6= 0, the nal
result is (written in terms of the minkowskian b):

 (k) =

if b2  m2

 (k) =   3

162

42s1 

m2

|b2|! b ,

if b2 > m2 .

(13)

(14)

for any time-like b and for a space-like b with |b2| > m2, eq. (13) is the relevant
one. surprisingly enough, in these cases our calculation to all orders in b gives the
same result as the one obtained in the b-linear aproximation of ref. [11]. obviously,
perturbation theory about b = 0 does not detect the dierent behaviour we have found
for b2 > m2.

the massless-fermion case is more subtle, since the limit m  0 does not commute
in general with the loop integral. for a space-like b, it can be obtained by taking the
appropiate limit of eq. (14). this gives (k) =  1
162 b. on the other hand, if b
is time-like, the integrand in eq. (11) has a pole at (k = 1,  = /2), and one must
be careful with the i prescription in the feynman propagator. this pole would not

4

have appeared if we had kept a non-zero external momentum. instead of doing that,
we provide three other possible ways of calculating the induced term in the massless
case, which give the same answer:

1. if one naively ignores the i piece, a simpler b-exact propagator can obtained for

m = 0:

sb(k) = i

(6 k + 6 b5)(k2 + b2  2p  b5)

(k + b)2(k  b)2

.

(15)

the calculation can then be simplied using feynman parameters and the result
(k) =  1

162 b is found for any b.

2. perturbatively, one can perform just a b-linear calculation, since in the massless
case the higher-order terms vanish for dimensional reasons. following the steps
of ref. [11], we see that a shift in one of the linearly divergent integrals gives a
 1
162 b contribution. the remaining identical integrals vanish in the massless
case, up to the ultraviolet ambiguity.

3. a more rigurous (and non-perturbative in b and in the ne-structure constant)
conrmation of the same result is provided in ref. [13] (following a suggestion
by d. colladay further developed in ref. [9]): an anomalous chiral redenition of
the fermion elds allows to get rid of the coupling to b, so that the contribution
(to all orders) to k(0, b, 0) comes from the corresponding fujikawa jacobian. up
to the unavoidable ambiguity (which in this method comes from the denition of
the current operator),  1

162 b is obtained again.

even in the b-exact result, an infrared regularization can spoil this result. for in-
3
162 b in the time-
stance, giving the fermion a small mass obviously shifts it back to
like-b case. at any rate this is just a formal discussion, since there are no massless
electromagnetically-charged fermions in nature.

it is rather striking that the contributions to (k) of diagrams with more than one
insertion of 6 b5 cancel. we have checked that this is indeed the case at order bb2. at
this and higher orders, all integrals are nite by power-counting, and hence unambigous.
after a shift in the loop momentum, one is left with two integrals, corresponding to
putting all insertions on the same propagator line, or one on one line and two on the
other line. explicit computation of these integrals shows that, although they do not
vanish, they have the opposite sign. therefore, their sum is zero. we have, however,
not found a simple argument for the vanishing of the third-order and higher-order
corrections.

let us discuss now how regularization and renormalization aect the result. this
is an important point because the complete s qed + s cpt theory is not nite and re-
quires renormalization (and, furthermore, renormalization is also relevant in a nite
theory [14, 15]). the exact decomposition sb(k) = s(k)  isb(k)6 b5s(k) performed in
ref. [11], shows that the ambiguities can only come from the lowest-order piece, the

5

rest being nite by power counting. therefore, the ambiguity in the induced chern-
simons part can be discussed either using the linear aproximation, the one-loop exact
calculation or the path-integral approach of ref. [9]. from the discussion above, it is
clear that the result of our calculation would be changed by any regularization that
destroys the (four-dimensional) spherical symmetry of the high-energy behaviour. this
is the case of dimensional regularization, which breaks the (four-dimensional) trace-
lessness of the combination k  1
4  k2. the converse is not true: even if a given
regularization preserves spherical symmetry, it may invalidate the steps we followed
to arrive at eq. (9). this happens again in dimensional regularization2. in general,
dierent regularizations (or subtractions) will render dierent results, even if they pre-
serve gauge invariance. this is apparent in dierential renormalization, which makes
the ambiguity explicit [10] (the situation in the gauge-invariant method of constrained
dierential renormalization [21] is similar to the one in dimensional regularization [22]).

as a matter of fact, independently of how one regulates and subtracts the divergent
integrals, one always has the freedom to add any (renormalizable) nite counterterm
that is allowed by the relevant symmetries of the theory [23]. this is also true when
the radiative corrections to that term are nite [15]. in the present case, this means
that, from the point of view of perturbative renormalization theory, the induced (k)
can have any value, for it is not protected by any symmetry [11] (except cpt and
lorentz invariance, but we just broke them). the interesting conclusion of our study is
the following: if the regulator and the subtraction rule are mass-independent, a mass-
independent result will be obtained to all orders in b in the physically-relevant cases,
as the cpt- and lorentz-violating terms coecients are much smaller than the mass
of any electromagnetically-charged fermion and eq. (13) provides the induced term in
this situation.

in ref. [1] an interesting discussion was made regarding the possible vanishing
of the induced chern-simons term due to an anomaly-cancelation mechanism in the
high-energy theory (of course, we consider now several fermion species). essentially,
the argument goes as follows. from the point of view of a more fundamental theory,
the diagrams with one6 b5 insertion (at one loop) can be viewed as the corresponding
triangular diagrams with the same photon legs and a third leg involving a coupling to an
axial vector, in the limit in which there is zero momentum transfer to the axial-vector
leg and the latter is replaced with a vacuum expectation value. the condition for the
cancelation of the anomalies ocurring in these diagrams then implies that the induced
term also cancels. this argument requires that the term induced by dierent fermions

2in the presence of chiral objects, several denitions of dimensional regularization exist. the naive
one, usually used in anomaly-free theories, takes an anticomuting 5 and is inconsistent with the usual
trace relations [16]. it is known to produce a wrong (zero) value for the triangular anomaly, which is
closely related to our problem. on the other hand, the consistent denitions of t hooft and veltman [17]
give rise to spurious anomalies that must be corrected with nite counterterms [18]. in our calculation
we have used an anticommuting 5 to invert the kinetic term and then taken usual four-dimensional
traces. finally, dimensional reduction [19] is also ambiguous (even at the one-loop level) in the presence
of chiral objects [20] . this short discussion should make clear that one must be careful when applying
dimensional regularization to this kind of calculations.

6

be the same. this is true if the induced term contains no mass dependence and, besides,
a universal and mass-independent renormalization prescription is adopted for all the
contributing diagrams3. our result shows that the rst requirement, which is trivial
at the b-linear order, holds to all orders in b. invoking the addler-bardeen theorem,
the argument for the vanishing of the induced term was also generalized in ref. [1]
to higher loops.
it must be noted, however, that higher loops can in principle give
rise to mass-dependent corrections (even at linear order in b), so that the anomaly-
cancelation condition does not forbidds the appearance of an induced chern-simons
term.

on the other hand, we have till now neglected the possible inuence of the a term
in eq. (1). in principle, corrections of order a2b and higher could appear, and they
are not necessarily smaller than the ones we have been dealing with. actually, one
can include the eect of a to all orders just by considering the corresponding a- and
b-exact propagator. this propagator is just the one in eq. (5) but with k substituted
by k  a. the vector a behaves then like an external momentum which appears
in all the propagators of the loop. since there are no derivative couplings, a shift in
the loop momentum k  k + a can completely eliminate a, so the result is not
aected. (of course, this shift is also subjected to regularization ambiguities.) the
situation is not so simple, however, if the eect of other sectors (like the cpt-even
lorentz-violating extension of qed considered in ref. [1]) is taken into account. this
is beyond the scope of the present work.

let us nally stress that even if the radiative corrections to the chern-simons term
cancel for some reason, it is still possible to add a nite counterterm and get a non-zero
(k). this is a sign of the fact that we have no right to put k = 0 at tree level,
unless there is some symmetry in the high-energy theory that imposes this value. in the
absence of such a symmetry, we are facing a problem of naturalness. on the other hand,
if one could really get (k) = 0 in a mass-independent way, one would have at least a
consistent low-energy theory, which would include the prescription k +(k) = 0. the
validity of such theory would only be justied a posteriori by the mentioned theoretical
and experimental reasons.
