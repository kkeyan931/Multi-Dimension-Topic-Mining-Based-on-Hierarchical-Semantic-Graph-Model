abstract

we conrm the intuition that a string theory which is perturbatively
infrared nite is automatically perturbatively ultraviolet nite. our
derivation based on the asymptotics of the selberg trace formula for
the greens function on a riemann surface holds for both open and
closed string amplitudes and is independent of modular invariance and
supersymmetry. the masses of the open strings stretched between
dbranes give a natural world-sheet ultraviolet regulator for the string
path integral preserving both t-duality and open-closed string world-
sheet duality.

in developing a formalism for nonperturbative string theory, it is impor-
tant to clarify which properties of the theory follow from world-sheet prin-
ciples alone. finiteness in the ultraviolet limit is a fundamental property of
the perturbative amplitudes of an infrared nite string theory, well known
to string experts [1]. unfortunately, since most discussions of niteness are
carried out in the context of superstring theory it is often incorrectly at-
tributed to supersymmetry. it has also been misconstrued as a consequence
of modular invariance a property of only the closed string sector of the
theory. to clarify both of these points unambiguously, we will examine the
ultraviolet limit of the amplitudes of the oriented bosonic string with mul-
tiple boundaries on dbranes. parallel and static dpbranes separated by a
distance r in a direction orthogonal to the branevolume lead to bps cong-
urations in string theory: left-moving string modes are identied with right,
upon spacetime reection at either dbrane. in the superstring this breaks
half of the spacetime supersymmetries. relative motion of the branes in a
direction orthogonal to the branevolume or, equivalently, a relative spatial
rotation of the branes in a plane embedded in the transverse space orthogo-
nal to the branevolume, breaks further the spacetime supersymmetries. but,
as we will see, the absence of innities in the ultraviolet limit for an infrared
nite string theory are quite independent of such supersymmetry breaking
boundary conditions.

infrared nite string theories require the absence of tachyon and tadpole
states in the string spectrum [1]. these conditions are easily achieved by,
respectively, introducing fermionic degrees of freedom on the world-sheet,
and including nonorientable world-sheets in the path integral. the eect
of the negative mass tachyon and the zero momentum massless states, or
tadpoles, that characterize the infrared limit of the oriented bosonic string
can be exposed explicitly in the path integral, distinguishable from other
features of the amplitude generic to any string theory. our derivation of
the ultraviolet asymptotics of the bosonic string path integral, based on the
selberg trace formula [2], can be applied to any string amplitude, open or
closed, and rests upon open-closed string world-sheet duality alone. the
result can in fact be inferred from previous work on bosonic closed string
amplitudes [3, 4, 25, 26]. we have simply claried their extension to both
open and closed string amplitudes.

unlike amplitudes in the closed string sector, where an infrared diver-

1

gence can always be mapped to ultraviolet and vice versa by a symmetry
of the amplitude modular invariance, it is meaningful to distinguish the
infrared and ultraviolet limits of an open string amplitude. let us review
this point with a discussion of the annulus diagram in bosonic string the-
ory. parameterize the annulus with world-sheet coordinates 0  1  1,
0  2  1, and boundaries of length l. the tree exchange of oriented closed
strings between a pair of parallel dpbranes with separation r in a direction,
x 24, and relative velocity v in a direction, x 25, can be written in the form
[28, 29]:

a(r, v) = v26z

(1)
where v=tanhu. small r corresponds to large l or, in terms of the inverse
length parameter, l=1/l, small l. the closed string tachyon and would-
bedilaton tadpoles present in the r infrared limit are exposed by ex-
panding the integrand in powers of e2l:

the two leading terms are absent in an infrared nite string theory. note
that the classical mass of the stretched string, mwr2l/2, gives a natural
cuto on the l0 limit of the string path integral.
conversely, we can expand in powers of e2l, which exposes the r0
ultraviolet limit of the amplitude:

(3)

in the absence of the leading terms in the expansion, in an infrared nite
string theory, the ultraviolet limit will be automatically nite quite indepen-
dent of spacetime supersymmetry. the ultraviolet limit is then an open string
abelian gauge theory with the goldstone boson that arises from the spontae-
nous breaking of spacetime translational invariance by dbrane boundaries

2

appearing at the rst massive level in the open string spectrum [6, 7]. the
mass of the stretched string plays the role of the classical mass of the gold-
stone boson. we will explore the analogous limit of the tree exchange am-
plitude of multiple bosonic dbranes [28], using the selberg trace formalism
[2].

the theta functions in eq. (1) are the result of summing over eigen-
modes of the laplacian on the annulus with p neumann and 24  p dirich-
let coordinates, and the boundary conditions: x 25 = 0, 2x 0 = 0 at
2 = 0, and x 25 = vx 0 at 2 = 1, on coordinates x 25, x 0. an intu-
itive picture of the large/small l asymptotics is provided by the diusion
time of a given eigenmode on the world sheet [9, 8]. the greens function
of the diusion operator, t  , is a trace over the eigenvalue spectrum,
(m1,m2)=42(m2

l2) + evac.(u), and m1, m2 > 0:

1 + m2

symmetrizing under m2  m2, a poisson resummation expresses the trace
in the equivalent form:

1+(n2iu/)2l2)/4t,

= xn1,n2

(5)

where a  l is the area of the surface. for small diusion times only the
lowest lying eigenmode is excited; this is the small l, or large r, limit. for
large diusion times, several modes can be excited together. the dominant
contribution to the path integral comes from the most excited states: heavy
closed strings, or, by world sheet duality, light open strings [7].

with this picture in mind, we now consider the extension to open string
amplitudes with b3 boundaries on dbranes. if we wish to identify the small
l limit of this amplitude as the tree gravitational interaction of b dbranes
with separations of order r>>, the boundaries live on distinct branes.
now the expression on the right hand side of eq. (5) has a simple geometric
interpretation. an arbitrary surface with cylindrical topology maps to a rect-
angular cell in the complex plane with edges of metric length (1, l). thus the
eigenvalue trace is a sum over a length spectrum of geodesic paths: paths

3

joining opposite edges of the unit cell, or, by the translational symmetry,
rezrez + 1, the opposite edges of two cells related by n1 translations. an
extension of this idea underlies the selberg trace formula for the greens func-
tion of the diusion operator on a riemann surface, s, with b3 boundaries
[2, 8].

since the sums over eigenfunctions are potentially divergent we introduce

regulators. consider the expression:

lndet =  lim

s0

d

ds z 



dtts1

(s) zs

d2zg[tret(+m2)]  em2t,

(6)

where  and m2 are, respectively, worldsheet ultraviolet, and infrared, regu-
lators, the latter being necessary only in cases where the laplacian develops
a zero mode. the infrared limit is then regulated by pauli villars subtrac-
tion as in [3, 4]. we will denote the factor in square brackets as g(z, z; t).
notice that the introduction of a cuto on diusion time gives an ultra-
violet regulator which preserves world-sheet reparameterization invariance.
the prescription also preserves both tduality, which relates open string
backgrounds with distinct numbers of dirichlet/neumann coordinates, and
openclosed string world sheet duality [1]. this should be distinguished from
the nite world sheet cuto for general nonperturbative string backgrounds
proposed in [10], which would break world sheet duality explicitly.

the greens function, g(z, z; t), is assembled from the basis of eigen-
functions of the laplacian on the riemann surface sb with euler character
 = 2b. the divergent contribution from the greens function at the source,
g(z, z; t), will be understood to have been subtracted from this trace; it can
be evaluated by the same method. by the uniformization theorem [11, 12],
we can map such a surface to a polygon h/b, a 9-sided subdomain of the
upper half complex plane, h, with constant negative curvature, rg = 1,
area element, da=dxdy/y2, y > 0, and, from the gaussbonnet theorem,
constant area, a = 4. b is the fundamental, or covering, group of the
riemann surface. the laplacian takes the form  = y2(2
y ). by the
riemannroch theorem, the shape of the surface is characterized by 3 real
parameters. we choose these to be the fricke-klein moduli [12, 13, 14]: the
lengths of b holes, and 2(b3) interior paths on sb, closed and nonintersecting,
and geodesic with respect to the poincare line element, ds2=d2 + sinh2d2.
these will be described in an example below. see, also, the discussion of

x + 2

4

uniformization and moduli in the appendix. thus, the length of a geodesic
path on h through the points z, z is given by the minimum:

h(z, z) = minzc

dy
y

= mincosh1[1 + |z  z|2
2yy

]1/2,

(7)

where c is an arbitrary path on h linking z, z.

thus, g on sb is composed from the basis of eigenfunctions of the lapla-
cian on the poincare upper half plane, h, with the periodicity property,
(x + x, y; q)=e2iq x(x, y; q), under shifts, rezrez+x, where q is a real
parameter. for eigenvalues parameterized as  = ( 1
4 + v2), with v real,
these take the form [22]:

(q,) = n(q,v)y1/2kiv(2|q|y)e2iqx,

(8)

where kiv(w) is a modied bessel function. neumann/dirichlet boundary
conditions may be imposed by evaluating the greens function on the double
of sb, a closed orientable riemann surface with b1 handles, and restrict-
ing to the subspace of eigenfunctions that are, respectively, even/odd with
respect to reection in the boundary [22].

the normalization, n(q,v), is determined by the integration measure:

g(z, z; t) = n 2

be recognized as the group invariant measure. integration over the angular

where h is the length of the geodesic path joining points z, z, and the
integral sums over lengths, b, of arbitrary paths on h joining z, z. the

5

parameter m 2 = m2 + 1
4 . the greens function for coincident points z = z
is obtained by simply setting the argument of the greens function to the
ultraviolet cuto on the world-sheet, a parameter of o(). insight into the
physical meaning of  will be obtained by considering the full amplitude as
shown below.

i=1

the precise spectrum of eigenvalues of  on h is not known by analytic
means [22]. however the growth of the density of eigenvalues for large  can
be estimated. we will use this estimate below to bound the behavior of the
greens function on sb for large . the opposite limit of small eigenvalues, and
short geodesics, determines the infrared l0 limit of the amplitude [25, 26].
the selberg trace formula expresses the greens function on the fundamental
polygon h/b to that on the covering space h [2, 8]. some key steps are
reviewed in the appendix. the fundamental group b of sb is the 3 param-
eter fuchsian subgroup of linear fractional transformations: every element
is related by a similarity transformation to a magnication, z=[z], with
generating elements constrained by the relation q3(b2)
i = 1, and tr > 2
for all b. more details can be found in the appendix. the magnication,
z = [z], denes a geodesic path on h/b, with length, h (z, z), dened as
above, and the 3 real parameters of the generating group elements can be
explicitly related to the fricke-klein moduli of s as shown in [13, 14, 15].
to gain some intuition into the moduli, consider orientable surfaces with
four holes, c[i], of common length of o(l), and two interior geodesics, homo-
topic to c[1]c[2], c[2]c[3], of length ls, lt . the reader may nd it helpful
to keep in mind the bosonic contribution to the tree scattering amplitude of
four d0branes in type iia string theory. the simpler b=3 pants amplitude
does not exemplify the general case since it lacks interior moduli. let the

distances between pairs of dbranes satisfy the inequalities, r12  r34  ,
with r13  r14  r >>> r12. then the l0 limit of the amplitude is
dominated by world-sheets with four long tubes of length l attached to the
respective dbranes. the remaining two moduli, ls, lt , can be interpreted
as the proper time for propagation of an intermediate closed string state
in, respectively, the s and t channels of the amputated amplitude. an ex-
plicit representation of the generating elements of the group 4 in terms of
psl(2,r) matrices, and the parameterization in terms of the six fricke-klein
moduli of s4, is given in [14].

alternatively, one can use the fenchel-nielsen length-twist parameteriza-

6

tion of the interior geodesic moduli [17, 14, 20]. returning to the example
above, a pair of coordinates, ls, s, where s is the dehn twist of c[1]c[2]
relative to c[3]c[4] before identication. in the limit l0, ls0, the static
amplitude factorizes into the product of four disc tadpole amplitudes with
emanating closed string propagators, and a closed string propagator linking
two cubic closed string interaction vertices, spatially separated by a distance
of o(r). upon setting the branes in motion, we can extract from this ampli-
tude an o(g2
c ) correction to the bosonic sector of an eight-point function of
supergravitons in m theory [16]. here, gc is the closed string coupling.

note that the presence of classical mass terms for the goldstone bosons
in the string path integral in this example, mwo(r/), with r13 
r14 >>> r12  r34, implies a lower cuto, lmin., on the integrals over geodesic
loop lengths. let lmin. be the shortest, non-contractible, geodesic loop length
summed in the string path integral, a parameter of o(/r2). the world-
sheet ultraviolet regulator, , is therefore of o(/r2). this prescription can
be compared with the observation in [21], where the role of the wboson
mass as a spacetime infrared regulator was noted. with the fenchelnielsen
coordinates as parameterization of conformally inequivalent classes of world
sheet metrics, t mg/conf  di 0, the measure in the path integral takes
the simple form [31, 28]:

a =

(11)

where the normalization of the amplitude is understood to be absorbed in the
regulated spacetime volume, v26, and the functional determinants are to be
computed with the given boundary conditions by an extension of the method
below [4, 31]. an arbitrary metric in mg can be uniquely transformed by
a conformal transformation plus dieomorphism continuously connected to
the identity, to the ducial constant curvature metric g [18, 19, 4]. the
parameterization of t is not unique. for a dierent parameterization, the
measure in the path integral is given by the determinant computed in [3]:

di[det((k)ef (l)ef )]1/2

k  kgab  1

2gabgcdkgcd, and gab is the ducial metric on some
where ab
gauge slice in the space of metrics, mg. the fenchel-nielsen coordinates
for t correspond to the choice for which this determinant is trivial. the
moduli dependence is then entirely contained in the lengths, li, of 2b  3
closed geodesic paths on s [14, 15], b  3 of which are interior paths, and
b  3 corresponding twist angles, j [17, 20, 31]. explicit examples and more
details can be found in [14].

the greens function on the polygon h/b can be written as:

tre(+m2)t = x6=1zh/b

dxdy

y2

g(z, [z]; t) + a(h/)  g(z, z; t).

(13)

the identity element in the fundamental group, [z] = z, gives the greens
function at the source, g(z, z; t). it has been separated from the sum over
group elements in eq. (13). this denes the poincare theta series, (t),
described briey in the appendix [8]. consider the primitive elements of
b, {}, transformations which cannot be expressed as a power of any other
transformation. then an arbitrary b can always be related by a similarity
transformation to an integer power of a primitive element, =p1, for
suitable integer p, and element  noncommuting with . for surfaces with
b holes, such a similarity transformation can be used to bring any primitive
element  to the form of a magnication [2, 8]. it follows that the length
parameter of the element, p, satises the relation l(p) = pl(). the use of
the similarity transformations then allow us to derive [2, 8]:

some key steps are given in the appendix. the factor in square brackets is a
generalized zeta function r(s) [2, 8, 27]. note that the integral over diusion
times, which we will denote by i(pl(); , m2), is regulator dependent.

the sum over primitive elements in eq. (14) needs further comment. the
spectrum of geodesic lengths on sb is discrete, a direct consequence of the
discreteness of the eigenvalue spectrum of the laplacian [22]. the l0 limit

8

determines the infrared r behavior of the amplitudes and has been exten-
sively studied in the literature [25, 26]. consider the double of the riemann
surface, sb, a closed oriented surface with b1 handles and 2(b3)+b pairs of
fenchel-nielsen moduli: lj, j, j=1,   , 3(b2). in the limit of a pinched cy-
cle, lj0 for some j, the world-sheet develops a long tubular neck, or collar,
with hyperbolic metric and eigenvalue spectrum, determined by the behavior
of the minimum length core geodesic on the pinched cycle [25]. the length
and twist moduli of the pinched cycle become redundant. the eigenvalue
spectrum on the complement of the surface, with collar region excised, can
then be bounded, and the divergence in the spectrum of the collar component
isolated. the result is similar to the long cylinder limit described earlier: in
either case, it comes from the clustering of low frequency, rotationally in-
variant, eigenmodes at the limit point: = 1
4 [25]. this analysis of the l0
asymptotics of the trace formula can be modied in the presence of a nite
cuto on the world-sheet. some preliminary steps are given in the appendix.
we will consider here the opposite limit of the amplitude, the ultravi-
olet r0 regime, dominated by the behavior of the large eigenvalues, or
long geodesics. unlike closed string amplitudes where the l region of
moduli space is absent as a consequence of modular invariance, there is an
o(/r2) dependent correction to the leading behavior of r(s). we will
nd, however, that the correction is exponentially damped as 0, conrm-
ing the intuition that a perturbatively infrared nite string theory is auto-
matically perturbatively ultraviolet nite. this is yet another illustration of
the breakdown of the perturbation theory at distances r<<.

cut o the sum over primitives for the rst n(l) primitives, partitioned
among m distinct lengths, lm, m = 1    m, upto some maximum value
l, with degeneracies nm, pm
m=1 nm = n. for suciently large m, l, the
sequence of lengths converges to a continuum and we can replace the factor
in square brackets in eq. (14) with an integral over the density of lengths
[24, 8]:

where  = s  1/2. the leading behavior can already be extracted from
[4]. we have simply claried its extension to the greens function on surfaces
with boundaries. as expected, for large l, the  dependent correction is
insignicant unless r<<. similar estimates can be made for the greens
function at the source, g(cosh(lmin.; )), and the greens functions of the
laplace-beltrami operators for higher rank tensor elds on sb [30, 4, 25].
these include the vector laplacian that appears in the measure for the string
path integral. the functional methods described here can be extended to
amplitudes with general boundary conditions [1]: moving [29], mixed [32]
for congurations with dbranes of dierent dimensionality, external eld and
nite temperature [33], and, most importantly, supersymmetric. work in this
direction is in progress.
thus far, we have restricted ourselves to a discussion of the open string
amplitude with multiple boundaries on separated dbranes, rij>, for ev-
ery i, j=1,   , b. consider the conguration with n superimposed dbranes,
within distances of o(), and a single dbrane at a distance r>>. the
ultraviolet l gauge theory on the stack is a nonabelian, u(n), gauge
theory [1]. we will conclude with the observation that open string perturba-
tion theory with a nite world-sheet ultraviolet cuto preserving both open-
closed world-sheet duality and t-duality gives a quantitative description of

10

the crossover regime:

between supergravity and perturbative super yang-mills theory [35, 16, 36].
c , is the eleven dimensional planck length, and r has
here, m 1
been identied with the typical length scale probed by the dynamics, i.e., the
spatial separation of two point sources in 11-d supergravity. this corresponds
to d0brane dynamics in the type iia string theory or, by a t-duality in the
direction x 9, to d1brane dynamics in the type iib string theory. the upper
bound in eq. (19) is the thooft radius, marking the transition to perturbative
sym theory. the lower bound, where the closed string coupling gco(1),
is the transition to the low energy limit of m theory. the signicance of
a world-sheet ultraviolet regulator preserving both open-closed world-sheet
duality, and t-duality, is now evident: iia string perturbation theory with
nite ultraviolet cuto o(/r2) can ll the gap between the kinematic
regimes of dlcq, the discrete light cone quantization of m theory, and of
11-d supergravity [16, 36]. upon t-dualizing, this covers the crossover region
between the supergravity and perturbative sym regimes of the iib string
[34, 35]. whether this can lead to detailed comparisons between open string
perturbation theory and nonperturbative formulations of dlcq [36], remains
to be investigated in the future.

a the selberg trace formula

the basic observation underlying the derivation of selbergs trace formula is
as follows [2]. a readable introduction appears in [8]. the greens function
of the scalar laplacian on s, with covering space the upper half plane, h,

11

is an example of a pointpair invariant , i.e., a symmetric kernel function
k(x, y), with x, y any two points in some domain f of arbitrary dimension,
such that k([x], [y]) = k(x, y) for all   , the covering group of f . then
the action of the group induces a symmetric kernel function p k(x, [y])
in the covering space, c, where f = c/. selbergs trace formula expresses
the kernels of a family of invariant operators, {l}, on the domain f as
functions of group invariant objects, {(x, y)}.
in our example, these are
the laplace-beltrami operators acting on arbitrary rank tensors on s, and
there is a single group invariant, h(z, z), the hyperbolic distance between
the two points. the measure for the kernel functions, {k((x, y))}, is the
group invariant measure on c, in our example, the p sl(2, r) invariant area
element on h.
selbergs trace formula expresses any kernel function on f as a group-
theoretic trace over a distinguished subset of elements of the covering group
 known as the primitive elements: elements which cannot be expressed as
a power of any other element of the group [2]. a crucial role is played in this
derivation by the similarity relation of the covering group. to illustrate this,
it is helpful to understand a concrete example and we will therefore begin with
a review of the domain and primitive elements of the modular group of s. but
the reader should keep in mind that the applicability of selbergs method to
the computation of symmetric kernel functions is much more general than this
specic example illustrates. for an account of some physics applications other
than string theory, consult the articles and references cited in the collection
[23].

b uniformization and kleinian groups

any riemann surface sh
(b,c), with b holes, c crosscaps, and h handles, can be
globally uniformized, i.e., represented parametrically by single valued holo-
morphic or meromorphic functions in a subdomain, f h
(b,c), of the riemann
sphere, c, the universal covering space of s [11]. an isometry of the riemann
sphere is an element of the mobius group, linear fractional transformations on
the complex plane, acting on coordinates, z, as [z] = az+b
cz+d, with a, b, c, dc,
and adbc = 1. the discrete subgroup of mobius transformations associated
with the isometries of the subdomain f , is a kleinian subgroup of the mobius

12

group. a special case is a fuchsian subgroup, obtained under uniformization
to a subdomain of the poincare upper half plane, h. every compact oriented
surface with negative euler character, =22hb, constant gaussian curva-
ture, rg, and geodesic boundaries, can be globally uniformized to a polygon
with 9 sides in h, fh/, whose shape is parameterized by 3 real
moduli parameters. the gaussian curvature is normalized to rg=1 and,
from the gaussbonnet theorem, the area equals a constant, a = 4.

geodesics in the complex plane with hyperbolic metric are circular arcs
degenerating, for suciently large radius, to straight lines perpendicular to
the real axis. under a conformal mapping of h to the interior of the unit
disk, d, the domain h/ maps to a subdomain of d, with homeomorphically
related hyperbolic metric. this is an equivalent global uniformization of
the riemann surface. note that the kleinian covering groups associated
with either choice of global uniformization necessarily coincide, although the
subdomains of the complex plane are distinct. one can move freely between
these two equivalent choices of domain as convenient [22].

it is possible to give an explicit representation in terms of psl(2,r) ma-
trices for the generating elements of the fuchsian group, b, of an orientable
riemann surface, sb, with b holes and no handles [14]. the conjugacy classes
of b correspond to homotopically inequivalent classes of closed paths on sb.
cutting open sb along b 3 interior geodesic paths gives b 2 pants: surfaces
of constant curvature 1 with three holes, p. then the generating elements
of b can be expressed as simple products of the generating elements of the
individual (j)

3 , j=1,   , b  2, as reviewed in [12][14][15].

a pants surface has three homotopically inequivalent classes of paths,
c[i]. an arbitrary non-intersecting path on p is homotopic to one of 3
boundaries, but c[1]c[2]c[3], so that the matrix representatives of the
generating elements satisfy the constraint, q3
i=1i=1. consider an arbitrary
path on p joining any two points, p , p . under uniformization to a sub-
domain of h, this maps into a semi-circular arc of length parameter, |tr|,
where z=[z], and  is an element of the covering group 3. the length
parameter coincides with the geodesic length between the points z, z, on
h/3 for those linear transformations that act as magnications. we will be
especially interested in geodesic paths. these are singled out by an appli-
cation of the similarity relation for the covering group: every element of a
fuchsian group b can be related by a similarity transformation to an orien-

13

tation preserving magnication, z=z [12]. the magnications, {}, serve
as representative elements of the conjugacy classes of the covering groups,
b.

c fundamental polygons and primitive ele-

ments

let us understand the meaning of a conjugacy relation for the elements of
the fundamental group  of some domain fc/. as explained above, an
arbitrary element in  can be transformed to a representative element, ,
by a conjugacy relation, 1=, for some   . the minimum distance
along the curve (z, [z]), measured with the group invariant metric, for paths
belonging to the conjugacy class of  determines a length parameter. for
the hyperbolic metric and the modular group b, this parameter is:

l()  min cosh1"1 + 1
2( + 1)]

= cosh1[ 1

2 |z  [z]|2
(imz)2 #

,

(20)

coincident with the trace of the representative group element, . thus,
the conjugacy class of the element  is isomorphic to a deformation class of
geodesic paths: paths homotopically equivalent to [z0], dened with respect
to some base point z0 that varies freely in h/b. the length parameter for
repeated magnications is additive, giving the relation, l(n) = |n|l(), for
every n  z [8]. these comments can be generalized to the general case.

this suggests a natural prescription for performing the sum over conju-
gacy classes of a covering group . we begin by dening a primitive element,
: a group element which cannot be expressed as a power of any other ele-
ment in . from the relation above, an arbitrary magnication, , can
be expressed as a power, n, of a primitive magnication, =n. arbitrary
group elements, , are then obtained by a sum over elements in the con-
jugacy class of : =1n,  . this would overcount by an overall
innity due to elements in  that commute with , since for any such ele-
ment the conjugacy relation maps n into itself. let us therefore dene the
centralizer of the primitive element , (), as the set of elements in  that

14

commute with . running once through the primitive magnications, , and
then summing, for xed , over every element   /(), runs exactly once
through the conjugacy classes of the group, . the conjugacy class of any
primitive magnication is therefore the set:

{}  { |  = (1n)    /(), n  z+} .

(21)

thus, a sum over the conjugacy classes of the covering group can be written
as the nested sum:



x{}

= x x/()

xn=1

.

(22)

this identity can be used to relate the greens function on the covering space
h to that on the fundamental polygon, h/b. this analysis of primitive
elements for a fuchsian group straightforwardly generalizes to the loxodromic
kleinian groups associated to a nonorientable surface [11]. it should be noted
that selbergs formalism can be applied to the schottky covering group of s,
under global uniformization to a disjoint subdomain of the at complex plane:
the fundamental domain of a genus h closed riemann surface is the region
in the complex plane exterior to 2h isometric circles, cj,c 
j, j = 1,   , h.
however, the decomposition into primitive elements could get involved.

d derivation of the trace formula

the analysis of conjugacy classes of the fuchsian group b applies to any
covering group for which we can identify primitive elements. for such a

group, the sum over conjugacy classes, p{}, can be written as the nested

sum:

x{} zc/

dx k(x, [x]) = x x/()



xn=1zc/

dx k(x, (1n)[x])

(23)

where dx denotes the group invariant measure in the domain fc/. ex-
tracting the identity element from the sum over primitive elements, we can
simplify:

x{} zc/

dx k(x, [x]) = x6=1



xn=1 x/()z[c/]

dx k0(x, n[x]) + zc/

dx k0(x, x),

(24)

15

where [c/] denotes the image of the fundamental domain under the action
of the group element, . the result is therefore expressed as a sum over
kernels k0(x, n[x]), each of which is integrated over the domain, c/(), of
an inconjugate primitive element :



xn=1zc/

x6=1

dx k0(x, n[x]) + zc/

dx k0(x, x)

.

(25)

here, k0(x, [x]) is the kernel function induced on c by the action of the
covering group. note that this mapping is bijective so we can interchange
the roles of k(x, y) and k0(x, y), obtaining either one from the other, given an
explicit parameterization of . the second term in this equation is simply
the area of the domain multiplied by the kernel function with coincident
arguments: area(c/) k0( = 0). this is the selberg trace formula [2].

e length spectrum and poincare theta se-

ries on sb

for the fuchsian groups, b, the selberg formula can be simplied as follows.
consider a magnication, p[z] = epl()z. then,

tre(+m2)t = x6=1



xp=1zh/()

dxdy

y2

g(z, epl([z]); t) + a  g(z, z; t)

,

(26)

where the argument of g(z, z; t) is the hyperbolic distance between z, z in
h/b:

cosh2(h(z, epl()/2)z)) = 1 + (1 + x2/y2)sinh2( 1

2pl())

,

(27)

where the contribution from the identity element to the group theoretic trace
has been singled out. here, a=4. a change of variables, (x, y)(u=x/y, l=lny),
in the trace formula gives the result:

tre(+m2)t = x6=1



xp=1z 



du" 2l()

(4t)3/2 z 

h

db

beb2/4tm 2t

coshb  coshh# ,

(28)

where we have suppressed the contribution to the trace from the identity
element: a  g(cosh(lmin.); t), the area times the greens function at the

16

source. in the absence of an ultraviolet cuto on the world-sheet, we can
simply replace lmin. with zero but it should be kept in mind that lmin. is
really of o(/r2), world-sheet ultraviolet regulator, , dependent.

interchanging the orders of integration over b,u, the half-space, b  h ,
with u arbitrary, can be mapped to the half-strip, u0  u  u0, b 
pl(), where u0=[cosh(b)cosh(pl())]1/2/2sinh(pl())/2. performing the
integrations gives the poincare theta series:

(t) =

f selberg zeta function

selbergs trace formula can be converted to innite product form, yielding
the selberg zeta functions with properties similar to those of the jacobi theta
functions. these are especially helpful in examining the large and small l()
asymptotics. a laplace transform of the poincare theta series, (t), is an
entire function in the s plane and, in particular, is regular at the origin, s = 0
[8]. consider the logarithmic derivative of z(s) with respect to the variable
s. then,

z (s)
z(s)  (s  1

2 )z 

0

es(s1)t(t)dt

,

(30)

which can be considered as a functional equation whose solution is the selberg
zeta function, z(s), dened as:



z(s) = y6=1

[1  e(s+k)l()]

yk=0

.

(31)

it is easy to verify that this denition is consistent with the integral transform
of (t). we begin with the left-hand-side:

z (s)
z(s)

= x6=1
= x6=1
