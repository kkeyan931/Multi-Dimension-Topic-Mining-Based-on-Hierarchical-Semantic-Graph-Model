abstract

an operator formalism for bosonization at nite temperature and density is developed.
we treat the general case of anyon statistics. the exact n-point correlation functions, sat-
isfying the kubo-martin-schwinger condition, are explicitly constructed. the invariance
under both vector and chiral transformations allows to introduce two chemical potentials.
investigating the exact momentum distribution, we discover anyon condensation in cer-
tain range of the statistical parameter. another interesting feature is the occurrence of
a non-vanishing persistent current. as an application of the general formalism, we solve
the massless thirring model at nite temperature, deriving the charge density and the
persistent current.

1 introduction

bosonization has become over the years an important tool for studying various two dimen-
sional eld theory phenomena. it has been successfully applied to the tomonaga-luttinger
liquid model [1], to quantum impurity problems [2] as well as in the theory of quantum
hall edge states [3], [4]. the possibility of describing in this framework also anyonic type
excitations, attracts recently much attention. apart from a few considerations [5], [6],
generalized statistics were not very popular in the past. the discovery of the quantum
hall eect however, drastically changed the status of the subject, promoting it into a
fundamental concept of modern condensed matter theory.

in the physical applications of bosonization, one has to deal essentially with systems
at nite temperature and density. this problem has been usually studied by means of
functional integration in the real or imaginary time formalism of thermal eld theory (see
for instance [7]). in spite of the progress reached along this way however, some relevant
structural questions (e.g. the treatment of generalized statistics) are still open. there
exist also some controversies, presumably related with genuine subtleties which appear
in handling time-ordered paths in the complex time-plane. for all these reasons, we
nd important at this stage to test at work an alternative approach to bosonization at
nite temperature and density - the real time operator formalism. this is precisely the
goal of the present paper. we will work directly in innite volume, thus avoiding some
delicate problems related with the thermodynamic limit, especially in the presence of
generalized statistics. the strategy will be to construct explicitly the thermal correlation
functions of anyons, vector and chiral currents and to extract information about some
physical quantities like the momentum distribution, the density and the persistent current.
our framework sheds new light on the role of the vector and chiral symmetries, which
allow to introduce two independent chemical potentials. we expect the validity of our
results to be quite general. indeed, there are several indications ([8], [9], [10]) that the
correlation functions we derive, capture the main universal features of one-dimensional
gap-less quantum liquids, which support anyonic statistics and generalize the tomonaga-
luttinger one [11], [12].

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we collect some general algebraic
properties of the free boson eld and its dual, describing also the corresponding thermal
representation. we also construct a set of anyon elds and establish their general prop-
erties. section 3 is devoted to the derivation of the anyonic correlation functions at nite
temperature and density. the symmetry content of these correlators, which satisfy the
kubo-martin-schwinger condition, is investigated. the momentum distribution of the
left- and right-moving anyonic modes is determined and a remarkable condensation-like
phenomenon is detected. in section 4 we consider the bosonization of fermion elds. a

2

general family of solutions of the massless thirring model, comprising also anyonic solu-
tions, is considered in section 5. we determine both the density and the persistent current
of the model at nite temperature. our derivation is free from any ambiguity and resolves
the existing discrepancies in the literature about the coupling constant dependence of the
density. the last section summarizes the main results and contains our conclusions.

2 from bosons to anyons

the fundamental building blocks for bosonization in 1+1 dimensions are the free massless

scalar eld  and its dual e. these elds are required to satisfy the equations of motion

g = diag (1, 1) ,

(1)

the relations

g (x) = g e(x) = 0 ,
e(x) =   (x) ,

and the equal-time canonical commutators

[(x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = [e(x) , e(y)]|x0=y0 = 0 ,

[0(x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = [0e(x) , e(y)]|x0=y0 = i(x1  y1) .

before constructing the nite temperature representation of  and e, it is useful to recall

some of their basic features which are representation independent (see also [13], [14] and
[15]).

obey eqs. (1,2). here {a(k), a(k)} are the generators of an associative algebra a with
involution  and identity element 1. the elds (5-6) satisfy the commutation relations
(3-4) provided that

[a(k) , a(p)] = [a(k) , a(p)] = 0 ,
[a(k) , a(p)] = (k) 2(k  p) 1 ,

where f is a test function of rapid decrease and e is eulers constant. the infrared origin
of the mass parameter  is clear and well understood [17].

a direct consequence of eqs. (5-9) are the commutation relations

where

[(x1) , (x2)] = [e(x1) , e(x2)] = id(x1  x2) 1 ,
[(x1) , e(x2)] = ied(x1  x2) 1 ,

are -independent. eqs. (11,13) imply that  and e are local elds. according to eqs.
(12,14),  and e are however not relatively local.

it is worth stressing that this fact,
known to be crucial for bosonization, generalized (anyon) statistics, duality and chiral
super-selected sectors, is universal and does not depend on the representation of a. this
observation is essential for nite temperature eld theory, where instead of the standard
fock representation f of a, one adopts a thermal representation t (see sect. 2.2),
induced by a kubo-martin-schwinger (kms) state [18] over a.
in what follows we will frequently use the basis of chiral right and left elds. in this
basis locality is less transparent, but one gains nice factorization properties. introducing
the light-cone coordinates

the chiral elds are dened by

(18)

(19)

let us denote by az the associative algebra generated by z . given any smooth real
valued function fz , it is easily checked that the shift transformation

fz

: z () 7 z () + fz () 1 ,

(20)

leaves invariant both eqs. (1,2) and the commutation relations (18). therefore, fz is an
automorphism of az . it can be given the form

fz

[z ()] = eiqz (fz ) z () eiqz (fz )

,

where the charges qz (fz ) satisfy

(23)

the automorphism (20) turns out to be essential for bosonization with non-vanishing
chemical potential.

we now turn to generalized statistics, which can be discussed at purely algebraic level.
in fact, let us concentrate on the set of elds parametrized by  = (,  )  r2 and dened
by

a(x; )  z(; ) exp(cid:20) i

2

where

( qr  ql)(cid:21) : exp(cid:8)i(cid:2)r(x) +  l(x+)(cid:3)(cid:9) : ,

qz

qz (1) ,

(24)

(25)

: is taken with respect to the creators a(k) and annihilators
and the normal ordering :
a(k). the normalization z(; ) will be xed in what follows. let us observe that due

5

to eqs. (22,23), the relative position of the two exponential factors in (24) is irrelevant.
notice also that under -conjugation,
a(x; ) =

(26)

.

z(; )
z(;)

a(x;)

although one may consider expressions more general then (24), the eld a(x; ) will be
enough for our purposes.

using eqs. (18,22,23), we derive the exchange relation

a(x1; 1)a(x2; 2) = r(x12; 1, 2) a(x2; 2)a(x1; 1) .

(27)

the exchange factor r reads

r(x12; 1, 2) = exp(cid:8)i(cid:2)2(12 + 12)d(x12) + 2(12  12)ed(x12) + (12  21)(cid:3)(cid:9).

the statistics of the eld (24) is governed by the behavior of (28) for 1 = 2 =  and
space-like separated points x2

12 < 0. by means of eqs. (13,14), one gets in this domain

(28)

a(x1; )a(x2; ) = exp[i(2   2)(x1

1  x1

2)] a(x2; )a(x1; )

therefore, a(x; ) is an anyon eld whose statistics parameter is

() = 2   2

.

.

(29)

(30)

bose or fermi statistics are recovered when  is an even or odd integer respectively.
the remaining values of  lead to abelian braid statistics. the basic fact behind this

implementation of generalized statistics, is clearly the relative non-locality of  and e.

in our discussion below we frequently use the chiral currents

(31)

(32)

(33)

jz ()

a straightforward computation, based on eq. (18), gives

where

[jz () , a(x; )] = 2z(  xz )a(x; ) ,
xz =(cid:26) x if z = r

z =(cid:26)  if z = r

x+ if z = l

if z = l

moreover, dierentiating (24) with respect to xz, one nds



xz

a(x; ) = iz : jz (xz) a(x; ) : .

(34)

which read in the chiral basis

the energy-momentum tensor of the elds  and e has two independent components,

z () =

: z () z () :=

: jz () jz () : .

(35)

indeed, one can directly verify that

[z (1) , z (2)] = iz (2) (12) .

(36)

finally, we would like to point out that the short distance expansion of the product
a(t, x1; )a(t, x2; ) involves the chiral currents. in fact, normal ordering this product,
one nds

a(x1; ) a(x2; ) = |z(; )|2 exp(cid:2)2u(x

where

u() =

(37)

(38)

the presence of the parameter  > 0 implies as usual the weak limit   0. from (37) one
derives the expansion

c(x, ; ) 

[a(x + ; ) a(x; )  a(x; ) a(x  ; )] =

i|z(; )|2 e[2u()+ 2u(+)] (cid:2)jr(x) +  +jl(x+) + o(+) + o()(cid:3) . (39)

eqs. (32,34,36) are useful for analyzing the symmetry content and the dynamics of a(x; ),
whereas (39) is convenient in the study of the short distance behavior.

summarizing, we have introduced the basic algebraic tools for bosonization - the
oscillator algebra a and the related eld algebras ar and al. we have established also
some identities needed in the construction of fermions and, more generally, anyons. since
a and az are innite algebras, some of our manipulations above were formal. in what
follows however, we shall deal with operator representations of a and az , in which the
just mentioned identities hold at least in mean value on a suitable domain of the state
space.

2.2 thermal representations

we start this section by constructing a thermal representation t of a, whose cyclic
vector is the gibbs (grand canonical) equilibrium state associated with

b < 0 .

hb =z dk

nb =z dk

2|k| a(k)a(k) ,

(40)

(41)

are the hamiltonian and the number operator respectively, and b is the chemical poten-
tial. the non-vanishing two-point correlation functions in this state are given by

=

b

b =

e(|p|b )

 2(p  q) ,
 2(p  q) ,

(42)

(43)

 being the inverse temperature. notice that the bose-einstein distribution appears as
a factor in the right hand side of (42,43). the parameter b < 0 allows to work with
well dened bosonic correlators. dealing with the physical anyon elds, introduced in the
next section, we will take the limit b  0. let us also recall for comparison that

ha(p)a(q)if = 0 ,
in the fock representation f of a.
referring to [18] for the rigorous argument, it is useful to sketch here a heuristic
derivation of the expectation values (42,43). since they are constrained by the commutator
(8), it is enough to concentrate for instance on eq. (42). setting

ha(q)a(p)if = |p|1

where eq.(8) and the cyclicity of the trace have been used. eq. (46) can be solved for
ha(p)a(q)i

using the commutation relation (8), a generic correlation function can be reduced to

(49)

as it should be expected, the correlators derived in this way satisfy the kms condition
corresponding to the automorphism of a

s a(k) = a(k)eis(|k|b ) ,

(50)

generated by kb . one easily checks for example that

h[sa(q)] a(p)i

= ha(p) [s+ia(q)]i

b

.

(51)

summarizing, eqs. (42,43,48,49) completely determine the thermal representation t
of a. since the distribution |k|1
is not positive denite, t has indenite metric.
this property is peculiar of the two-dimensional world and it is also present in the fock
representation [19] dened by eq. (44). we will address some of its aspects later on, when
discussing the physical representation of the anyon eld (24).



it is straightforward at this point to compute the correlation functions of r and l.

where the summation runs over all permutations of the integers {1, ..., 2n}, such that
k1 < k3 < ... < k2n1 and k2j1 < k2j for j = 1, ..., n. the two-point function, which is
the fundamental building block, reads

(54)

since  > 0 and |b| > 0, eq. (54) provides a well dened integral representation of
w(; , b). the full -dependence and the singularity in b = 0 are captured by

w(; , b) =

(55)

where o(b) stands for -independent terms vanishing in the limit b  0.
as already mentioned, the parameter b has been introduced exclusively for technical
reasons. it has nothing to do with the chemical potentials for fermions and anyons. in
order to recover the latter, we need the automorphism

in conclusion, starting with the thermal representation t of a, we have constructed
the representation tz (z ) of az . we will show in what follows that tr(r) and tl(l)
provide the basis for bosonization at nite temperature.

3 anyons at nite temperature and density

in this section we adopt the tensor product tl(l)tr (r) for the construction of anyonic
elds.

3.1 the physical representation - basic properties and correla-

tion functions

by analogy with the zero temperature case, we concentrate on the qz -symmetric anyon
correlation functions. because of eq. (32), they are characterized by two selection rules,

coming back to the points (i-ii) above, we observe that the property (i) is essential for
our construction. like at zero temperature, the -independence of (70) signals positivity.
in fact, repeating with some obvious modications the argument of reference [20], one
can prove that the correlation functions (69) are positive denite, which is crucial for the
physical interpretation. point (ii) in turn, allows to eliminate b from the qz -symmetric

13

correlators, in agreement with the fact that the relevant chemical potentials at anyonic
level are z . this issue is discussed few lines below.

we are now in a position to perform an important step - the denition of the physical

quantum elds {aph(x; ), jph
 = {1,1, ..., n,n} and let us consider the family {a(x; ) :   }. we dene

(73)

being positive denite by construction, the functions (73) determine, via the reconstruc-
tion theorem [14], the elds {aph(x; ) , jph
z () :   }. the explicit form of the physical
correlators (73) is quite remarkable and deserves a comment. without current insertions,
the equal-time n-point function is a nite temperature and density generalization of the
jastrow-laughlin wave function [3]. we recall that the latter describes the n-particle
ground state in several one-dimensional models, showing a tomonaga-luttinger liquid
structure. in that context, the current insertions in (73) are associated with the charged
excitations of the liquid. let us mention also that (73) admits a well dened continuation
to imaginary time, which still represents nite temperature and density version of the
jastrow-laughlin wave function, though in two spatial dimensions.

the expectation values (73) are invariant under the transformations:

aph(x; ) 7 aph((x0 + t, x1); ) ,

we denote the corresponding conserved charges by h and qz and we consider the auto-

one can verify that the physical correlation functions (73) obey the kms condition relative
to s with (inverse) temperature . in particular,

metries at nite temperature, we would like to mention that there exist an alternative
conformal eld theory approach to bosonization (see e.g. [21] and references therein).

let us collect now some of the basic properties of {aph(x; ) , jph

follow from their correlation functions. combining (26) and (67), one gets

z () :   }, which

aph (x; ) = aph(x;)

.

(84)

the exchange matrix and the statistical parameter of the physical anyon elds are given
by (28) and (30) respectively, whereas (71) implies

[jph
z () , aph(x; )] = 2z(  xz)aph(x; ) ,

(85)

where the notation (33) has been used. the translation of eq. (34) in terms of physical
elds reads

eqs. (89,90) provide a consistency check on the physical correlation functions (73) and
(88). moreover, the  -contribution in the right hand side of eq. (90) xes the value
of the central charge. as it should be expected on general grounds, the latter is - and
z -independent.

finally, from eq. (39) one gets

c ph(x, ; ) 
i (2)d() e[2u()+ 2u(+)] (cid:2)jph

l (x+) + o(+) + o()(cid:3) . (91)

this identity suggests that aph and jph
z are not independent and that one can recover
z from aph by point-splitting. for this purpose we assume that  is a space-like vector
jph
(2 = + < 0) and observe that the behavior of c ph(x, ; ) when   0 is direction
dependent. setting

zz (; ) =

(2)d()

one gets from (91)

we stress that the two limits in the right hand side of (93) and (94) do not commute and
must be taken in the prescribed order. one constructs in this way jph
l ) from aph(x; ),
provided that  6= 0 ( 6= 0). we would like to mention that the inverse operation is also
possible. aph(x; ) can be expressed in terms of jz , which allows to develop a framework
for bosonization, totally based on the algebra of chiral currents. we refer for the zero
temperature case to [13] and [22].

r (jph

summarizing, with any set  a thermal anyon representation t (; l, r) is asso-
ciated, which is dened by the expectation values (73). let us consider the set  =
{, , , } with

 = (,  ) ,

 = (, ) ,

() = 2   2 6= 0 .

(95)

the corresponding representation will be denoted by t (,  ; l, r) and is essential in
the bosonization of fermions.
in what follows, we will use exclusively the physical anyon representations constructed
above, omitting for sake of notation simplicity the apex ph. one should always keep in
mind however that {a(x; ) , jz () :   } and {aph(x; ) , jph
z () :   } are dierent
quantum elds.

3.2 momentum distribution and anyon condensation

in order to get a deeper insight into the physical properties of the eld a(x; ), it is
instructive to derive the relative momentum distribution. for this purpose we consider
the fourier transform

employing eqs. (70,73) one easily derives

since the contributions of the left- and right-moving modes factorize, it is convenient

to consider rst the particular cases

and

cw (, k; (, 0)) = 2(  k)(cid:0)k + r; 2, (cid:1) ,
cw (, k; (0,  )) = 2( + k)(cid:0)k + l ;  2, (cid:1) .

(101)

(102)

eqs.
(101,102) have a simple physical interpretation: the -factors x the dispersion
relations, whereas the -factors give the momentum distributions. eq. (101) for  = 1
and eq. (102) for  = 1 provide useful checks. from the exchange relation (29) we

18

already know that the elds a(x; (1, 0)) and a(x; (0,1)) have fermi statistics. in the
next section we will show that they are actually canonical right and left chiral fermions.
in agreement with this fact, setting  = 1 in eq. (100), we get from (101,102)

,

as expected, the familiar fermi distribution at nite temperature and chemical potential

one can get a general idea about  from 3d plot in gure 1. in the range   1,
 is monotonically increasing on the whole line k  r. when 0 <  < 1,  increases
(106,107), admits at least one local
monotonically for k  0 and, according to eqs.
maximum for k > 0. let us denote the position of the rst one (when k moves from 0
to ) by kc (, ). we have numerical evidence that this maximum is unique, but we
have not an analytic proof of this statement. the plots of  (see gs. 1-2) indicate an
interesting condensation-like behavior around kc . the phenomenon is clearly marked for
small values of the temperature and/or of the parameter  in the domain 0 <  < 1.
we nd it quite remarkable that for any xed temperature, one can achieve an arbitrary
sharp anyon condensation, taking a suciently small . see in this respect gure 3, where
the momentum distribution is plotted for  = 101.

concerning the behavior of cw (, k; ) (see eq. (98)) when both  6= 0 and  6= 0,

20

the above analysis implies condensation at

 = kc (2, ) + kc ( 2, )  r  l ,

k = kc (2, )  kc ( 2, )  r + l ,

(108)

(109)

provided that 0 < 2 < 1 and 0 <  2 < 1

it is worth mentioning that the condensation eect we discovered, does not contra-
dict the hohenberg-mermin-wagner (hmw) theorem about the absence of condensation
in one space dimension. the point is that under very general conditions, any anyonic
statistics can be equivalently described by a suitable exchange interaction with two- and
three-body potentials, determined [23] by the exchange factor (28). when these poten-
tials are conning, some assumptions of the hmw theorem are violated and condensation
may occur [24], [25] even in one dimension.

in conclusion, we have shown that the right (left) moving modes of the anyon eld
a(x; ) condensate in the range 0 < 2 < 1 (0 <  2 < 1). some applications of this
phenomenon are currently under investigation [26].

4 a particular case - fermions

an useful testing ground for the bosonization scheme proposed above is provided by the
free fermion eld. the possibility to express the latter in terms of bosonic elds, was
discovered long ago by jordan and wigner [27]. using the general results of the previous
section, we will discuss below some aspects of this phenomenon at nite temperature and
density. let us start by the 1+1 dimensional massless free dirac equation

where

(x) =(cid:18) 1(x)

obey eq. (110). here {b(k), b(k), d(k), d(k)} are the generators of an associative algebra
a+ (with involution  and identity element 1), which are assumed to satisfy the anti-
commutation relations

{b(k) , b(p)} = {b(k) , b(p)} = {d(k) , d(p)} = {d(k) , d(p)} = 0 ,
{b(k) , b(p)} = {d(k) , d(p)} = 2(k  p) 1 .

combining eqs. (112-113) and (114), one nds

{(x1) , (x2)} = 0 ,

{(x1) , (x2)} =(cid:18) (x

(x+

which in particular imply the equal time canonical anti-commutation relations.

as a consequence of (110), both the vector and the axial currents

{b(k), d(k)} and the annihilators {b(k), d(k)}. the duality relation

holds because of the identity 5 = . one has

j5
(x) =  j(x)

[j0(x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = (x1  y1)(y) ,
0 (x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = (x1  y1)5 (y) .

in this equilibrium state are:

like in the bosonic case, by using h1i
= 1 a generic n-point function can be expressed
in terms of (123-126). the correlation functions of  are therefore fully determined. the
ones involving 
a and a with the same value of the index a, can be reduced by means of
eqs. (115) to

(130)

which claries the physical meaning of the chemical potential 5. it gives rise to a persis-
tent current at nite temperature. we will discuss later on this interesting phenomenon
in the context of the thirring model.

let us show now that the free fermion eld considered above, has an equivalent
bosonized description. for this purpose we take the representation t (, 0; l, r) and
set

(x; ) =(cid:18) 1(x; )

a(x; (0, )) (cid:19) .
2(x; ) (cid:19) (cid:18) a(x; (, 0))

(131)

since 1 and 2 depend on x and x+ respectively, the eld  obviously satises eq.
(110). according to eq. (30), the corresponding statistical parameter is

 = 2 ,

 6= 0 ,

(132)

showing that, in general,  obeys anyon statistics. the existence of anyonic solutions of
the free dirac equation (110) is not surprising. let us recall in this respect that there is
no genuine notion of spin in 1+1 dimensions, because the rotation group is trivial. being
associated with the one-parameter group of boost transformations, which is non-compact,
the lorentz spin l() (see eq. (83)) may take any real value.

at this point we need the correlation functions of . from eqs.(70,73), one gets

since the mixed -correlators factorize like in the -case, it is enough to compare eqs.
(133,134) with eqs. (127,128). for this purpose we observe that the i-prescription in the
numerator of (133) and (134) is actually superuous and the identity

which makes possible the bosonization at zero temperature.

in view of (135), we conclude that the correlation functions of (x) and (x; ) coin-

cide, provided that

and

(137)

(138)

in other words, the representations t (1, 0;  + 5,  5) and t (1, 0; 5,  + 5)
are equivalent and yield the bosonized version of the eld . for

2 = 2n + 1 ,

(x; ) still possess fermi statistics, but is not canonical. according to the results of
the previous section, the momentum distributions of both 1(x; ) and 2(x; ) signal
condensation in the range 0 < 2 < 1.

for completing the fermi-bose correspondence, we have to nd in t (, 0; l, r) the

 of the fermionic currents (116). let us dene

counterparts j and j 5

j0(x) = j 5
j1(x) = j 5

these currents are conserved by construction. moreover, eq. (71) implies

[j0(x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = (x1  y1)(y)
0 (x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = (x1  y1)5 (y)
[j 5

,

(142)
(143)

which precisely reproduce eqs. (118,119). notice that the normalization in (140,141) is
uniquely xed by requiring (142,143). using (60), one nds

(144)

as it should be expected, (129) and (144) are equivalent, if (137,138) are satised.

of motion is

where g  r is the coupling constant and the factor  has been introduced for further
convenience. both vector and chiral currents,

i(x) = g [(x)(x)](x) ,

j(x) = (x)(x) ,

j 5
 (x) = (x)5(x) ,

are conserved, satisfy the duality relation

and have the following equal time poisson brackets

j 5
 (x) = j (x) ,

{j0(0, x1) , (0, y1)}p.b. = (x1  y1)(0, y1) ,
{j 5

0 (0, x1) , (0, y1)}p.b. = (x1  y1)5(0, y1) .

introducing

j+(x) = j0(x) + j1(x) ,

j(x) = j0(x)  j1(x) ,

eq. (145) can be rewritten in the form

(146)

(147)

(148)
(149)

(150)

2i+1(x) = g j+(x)1(x) ,

2i2(x) = g j(x)2(x) .

(151)

our problem is now to quantize this system at nite temperature and chemical potentials
 and 5, associated with the charges q and q5 generated by the currents (146). more
precisely, we look for operators {, j+, j} acting on a hilbert space and satisfying the
requirements:

26

 (a) there exist suitable normal products n[j+1](x) and n[j2](x), such that the

quantum versions

2i+1(x) = g n[j+1](x) ,

2i2(x) = g n[j2](x) ,

(152)

of (151) hold;

 (b) the operators

j0(x) =

1
2

[j+(x) + j(x)] ,

j1(x) =

1
2

[j+(x)  j(x)] ,

(153)

are the components of a conserved current j(x) and

[j0(x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = (x1  y1)(y) ;
 (x) is related to j(x) via the duality relation (147) and it

(154)

 (c) the axial current j 5

is also conserved;

 (d) the correlation functions of {, j+, j} obey the kms condition relative to the

automorphism

s 1(x) = eis(+5 )1(x0 + s, x1) ,
sj(x) = j(x0 + s, x1) ,

s  r ,

s 2(x) = eis(5 )1(x0 + s, x1) ,

(155)

with (inverse) temperature .

in the previous section we have actually solved the problem dened by (a-d) in the case
g = 0. this solution suggests considering the representation t (,  ; l, r) (see eq. (95))
and setting

1(x)  a(x; ) , 2(x)  a(x; ) ,

(156)

which generalizes eq. (131). the next step is to identify the normal product n we are

looking for, with

.... then, dening

...  
j+(x)  

1

 + 

jl(x+) ,

j(x)

 + 

jr(x) ,

we see that (86) implies (152), provided that

2 ( +  ) = g .

27

(157)

(158)

in addition, inserting (157) in (153), we nd that the requirements of point (b) above are
satised. let us focus on (c). the duality relation (147) denes a conserved chiral current
j 5
 (x) in terms of j(x). a simple computation gives

[j 5
0 (x) , (y)]|x0=y0 = 

  
 + 

(x1  y1)5(y) .

because of eq. (158), for g 6= 0 one has

   6=  +  ,

(159)

(160)

which shows the presence of a quantum correction in the right hand side of (159) with
respect to (149). this is a known unavoidable feature [29], following from (a-b).

finally, let us consider condition (d). from the results of sect. 3.1 we deduce that it

is satised, if the parameters z of t (,  ; l, r) are xed according to

using eqs. (95) and (158) one can express (,  ) in terms of (g, ). two solutions are
found:

(162)

(163)

since (,  )  r2, the coupling constant g and the statistical parameter  are constrained
by

 > g .

(164)

anyonic solutions of the thirring model have been proposed and investigated recently
also in [30].

the correlation functions of the thirring eld  follow directly from eq. (70) and
coincide for both solutions (162) and (163). from eqs. (60,157,161-163) one can derive
the expectation value of the thirring current j(x) in the gibbs state:

hj0(x)i

, 5

=



(g + )

,

hj1(x)i

, 5

=

.

(165)

comparing eq. (165) to the free case (129,130), one observes nontrivial corrections induced
by the interaction and the anyon statistic. previous investigations ([31], [32], [33]) of the

28

, 5

charge density hj0(x)i
in the case  = 1, have given contradictory results. we conrm
the result of [32] and [33] and extend it to the general class of anyon solutions with  6= 1.
in the functional integral framework of [32] and [33], the g-dependence of the charge
density stems from topological contributions.
it is worth stressing that our operator
approach reproduces the same g-dependence in a at 1+1 dimensional minkowski space-
time.

to our knowledge, the appearance of a persistent current hj1(x)i

in the nite
temperature thirring model represents a novel feature. we would like to recall in this
respect that persistent currents of quantum origin have been experimentally observed
([34], [35]) in mesoscopic rings placed in an external magnetic eld. such elds are absent
in the two-dimensional world, but chiral symmetry, combined with duality still allow for a
non-vanishing hj1(x)i
. notice that the persistent current (165) grows for small values
of , diverging in the limit   0.
we nd that

concerning the energy-momentum tensor t(x) of the model, by means of eq. (89)

, 5

, 5

t00(x) = t11(x)  l(x+) + r(x) ,
t01(x) = t10(x)  l(x+)  r(x) ,

6 conclusions

in the present paper we have developed an operator formalism for bosonization at nite
temperature and density, which applies not only to fermions, but covers the case of gen-
eralized statistics as well. the approach is systematic, works directly in innite volume

29

e, we have constructed a set of elds a(x, ), parametrized by  = (,  )  r2. for generic

and produces an explicit solution. starting from the conventional chiral eld algebras
{az : z = r, l}, naturally associated with the free massless scalar eld  and its dual
values of , a(x, ) exhibits abelian braid statistics. the basic tool in our framework is
the thermal representation tl(l)tr (r) of al ar, characterized by inverse temper-
ature  and chemical potentials l and r. we derived explicitly all correlation functions
of the eld a(x, ) in the representation tl(l)  tr(r), verifying the kms condition.
the n-point function represents a generalization of the jastrow-laughlin wave function.
the exact momentum distributions of the left- and right-moving modes, following from
the 2-point function, reveal in certain range of the variables (,  ) a clear condensation-
like behavior. the parameters l and r are related to special shift authomorphisms of
al and ar. suitable combinations of l and r dene the physical chemical potentials
 and 5, which are proportional to the vector- and chiral-charge densities. by duality,
5 6= 0 implies a non-vanishing persistent current.
the characteristic features of our nite temperature and density bosonization proce-
dure have been illustrated on the example of the massless thirring model. we established
a general class of anyonic solutions, providing an unambiguous derivation of the charge
density and demonstrating the presence of a persistent current.

the general framework proposed in the paper is mathematically self-consistent and
is interesting not only from a purely theoretical point of view. it is widely accepted by
now, that the excitations described by the anyon eld a(x, ) are relevant for a class of
low dimensional condensed matter systems in which the one-dimensional luttinger liquid
plays an important role. it is claimed for instance that the edge currents in the fractional
quantum hall eect can be described by a luttinger liquid [4]. andersons [36] proposal for
explaining high temperature superconductivity is based on the two-dimensional hubbard
model, whose ground state and low-energy excitations are also interpreted in terms of
a luttinger liquid.
in this context, the phenomenon of anyon condensation and the
appearance of a persistent current, discovered in this paper, deserve further attention.
for application to quantum impurity problems, it will be interesting to extend to nite
temperature and density the bosonization procedure on the half line, developed in [37].
we hope to report on this subject in the near future.

appendix

in this appendix we prove the determinant formulae (135,136). it is obvious that

det

(xi  yj)

=

p (x, y)

i,j=1

(xi  yj)

qn

,

(170)

where p is a polynomial of degree n2  n, n being the order of the determinant. because
of translation invariance, p depends only on the dierences xij, yij and xi  yj. moreover,
if xi = xj the determinant has two identical rows and vanishes, so p must be divisible by
xij; in the same way if yi = yj the determinant has two identical columns, so p must be
divisible by yij. we can write then

p (x, y) = c

(xij)

nyi,j=1

i<j

(yij)

nyi,j=1

i>j

(171)

where c is a constant, potentially depending on n. considering the particular case xi =
yi + i and expanding in i one immediately checks that c = 1. formula (136) is a direct
consequence of eqs. (170,171).
