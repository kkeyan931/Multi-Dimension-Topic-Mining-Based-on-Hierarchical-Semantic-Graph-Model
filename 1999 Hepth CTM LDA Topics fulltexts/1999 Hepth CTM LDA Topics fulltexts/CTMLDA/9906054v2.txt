abstract

we compute the conformal anomalies of boundary cfts for scalar and fermionic
elds propagating in ads spacetime at one-loop. the coecients are quantized,
with values related to the mass-spectra for kaluza-klein compactications of su-

pergravity on ads5  s5 and ads7  s4. our approach interprets the partition

function of elds on ads spacetime in terms of wave-functionals that satisfy the
functional schrodinger equation.

1 introduction

given the current interest in supergravity in an anti de sitter background it would seem
useful to develop techniques for studying quantum eld theory beyond tree-level in such
a spacetime. in this paper we will consider the simplest one-loop quantity, namely the
conformal anomaly of the boundary theory. the central object of study in the ads/cft
correspondence, [1] is a functional integral for a quantum eld theory in anti de sitter
space expressed in terms of the boundary values of the eld. whilst this can be treated
by the usual semiclassical expansion it may also be interpreted as the large time limit
of the schrodinger functional of the quantum eld theory and so satises a functional
schrodinger equation. we will show how to obtain this large time behaviour from a short
time expansion using analyticity. we will illustrate our method by reproducing the known
two-point functions of the cft for free scalar and fermionic elds in ads and then derive
the one-loop contribution to the conformal anomalies for these theories. our approach
also yields a straightforward calculation of the tree-level contribution to the conformal
anomaly for the pure gravity sector.

following [2] we consider the euclidean version of adsd+1 with co-ordinates {x} 

{t, x1, .., xd} and metric

ds2 =

1

(x0)2

d

(dx)2 =

x=0

t2 (dt2 + dx  dx).

(1)

we will think of t, which is restricted to the range t > 0, as euclidean time. the
boundary, m, consists of rd at t = 0 conformally compactied to a sphere by adding
a point corresponding to t =  where the metric vanishes. for illustration consider a
scalar eld theory propagating on this space-time. we study the functional integral

z[] = z d es(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)|m =

,

s =

1

2 z dd+1xg (g  + v ())

(2)

where d is the volume element induced by the reparametrization invariant inner product
on variations of , ||||2 = r dt dx 2/td+1. we will need to regulate this by restricting
t to the range  > t > , so dene

, [ , ] = z d es(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)( )= ,( )=

.

(3)

since the point corresponding to t =  is part of m we set  = lim|x| (x) as
we take the limit of large  and small  to recover z. this is usually described as a
partition function, but it may also be interpreted in terms of the wave-functionals that
represent states in the schrodinger representation. first change variables from t,  to
t = ln t,  = /td/2 so that the volume element and kinetic term become the usual ones
associated with the canonical quantization of . thus z[] is the   0,    limit of

and f , i are the value of  on the surfaces t = t1 = ln  and t = t2 = ln  respectively.
now z[ f , i] can be interpreted as the schrodinger functional, i.e. the matrix element of
the time evolution operator between eigenstates of the eld operator,

t2
which satises the functional schrodinger equation

z[ f , i] = h f | t exp(z t1

with the initial condition that it tends to a the delta-functional [ f  i] as t1 approaches

clearly the coincident functional derivatives stand in need of regularization, which intro-
duces a short-distance cut-o. by extending the at-space arguments of symanzik [3] we
would expect that for a renormalizable eld theory wave-function renormalization and an
appropriate choice of the dependence of v on the cut-o would ensure the niteness of the
solution to (8) in the limit that the cut-o is removed. since this can involve the use of
counter-terms associated with the boundaries we would expect that the renormalization
constants may depend on  and . however in many applications the tree-level solution
is sucent for which these considerations are unnecessary. we will see later that e con-
tributes to the conformal anomaly. a similar argument yields the schrodinger equation
that gives the  dependence

(10)
in [4]-[7] a general approach to solving the functional schrodinger equation was devel-
oped. consider the logarithm of , [ , ], w, [ , ]. in perturbation theory this is
a sum of connected feynman diagrams. in quantum mechanics we might try to solve
the schrodinger equation by expanding in a suitable basis of functions. an analogous
construction is to expand in terms of local functionals, i.e. a derivative expansion. now
w, [ , ] is non-local, but it will reduce to the integral of an innite sum of local terms
when it is evaluated for elds that vary slowly on the scale of  . each term will depend
on a nite power of the eld and its derivatives at a single point, x, on the quantization
surfaces t = , t = . although this expansion is appropriate for slowly varying elds
the functional for arbitrarily varying elds can be reconstructed from it because the func-
tional evaluated for scaled elds (x/) and (x/) can be analytically continued to

2

the complex -plane with the negative real axis removed. thus cauchys theorem will
allow us to relate rapidly varying elds (small ) to slowly varying ones (large ), and from
this we can use the behaviour for small  to obtain that for large  , which is what is needed
in the ads/cft correspondence. similar considerations enable the schrodinger equation,
which because it has an ultra-violet cut o involves rapidly varying elds, to be turned
into an equation acting directly on the local expansion, determining the coecients of
that expansion from a set of algebraic equations. (in at space these equations can be
solved perturbatively where they yield the usual results for short-distance eects in scalar
eld theory [5] and for the beta-function in yang-mills theory [7].)

in the next section we prove the analyticity property that we will need to relate short
and large time behaviour. we apply this to the example of the scalar eld in section 3,
reproducing the known scaling property of the two-point function in the cft, and in
section 4 we compute the one-loop conformal anomaly for this d-dimensional boundary

theory, showing that it vanishes unless q(d/2)2 + m2 is a positive integer, where m is the

mass in the ads lagrangian. for d = 2 this integer is the value of the central charge
of the virasoro algebra. the free fermion is discussed in section 5 where we show that
the chiral projection that is known to occur in this theory is related to the reducibility of
the floreanini-jackiw representation of fermionic elds. we also compute the conformal
anomaly at one-loop for fermions and nd that similarly to the scalar case, it vanishes
unless |m| + 1/2 is an integer. for d = 2 this integer is again the value of the central
charge of the virasoro algebra. for d = 4 these values of the masses correspond to the
scalar and fermion mass spectra in the kaluza-klein compactication of supergravity on
ads5  s5. finally, in section 6 we discuss pure gravity, for which our formalism yields a
simple calculation of the conformal anomaly.

2 analyticity of schrodinger functional

to show analyticity of , [ , ] we generalize to curved space the arguments of [4]-
[7]. we rst make the dependence on ,  explicit by modifying a standard phase-space
derivation of the functional integral representation of the schrodinger functional. by the
usual argument we can write z[ f , i] as

n+1

yj=1 dj exp


(h[j, j1] tj) + iz dx j ( j  j1)
 ,

(11)

lim

nz

n

yj=1d j

n+1

xj=1

where  is the eigenvalue of the canonical momentum conjugate to , tj = tj  tj1 and
n+1 = f and 0 = i. f appears in this expression only in the in+1 n+1 term in
the exponent, whereas i appears in i1 0, and terms proportional to t1, which can
be neglected as t1  0. so the contribution of i and f to (11) can be manifested by
adding to the exponent ir dx (n+1 f  1 i) and taking n+1 = 0 = 0. thus i and
f appear as sources coupled to  when we integrate out the momenta, j, so that we
arrive at the functional integral

where the boundary condition on  is now that it should vanish at t = t1, t2.  is a
regularization of 1/ which cancels certain divergences that arise in the evaluation of (12)
whose origin is explained in [4]. if we now interchange the roles of t and x1, and think of
x1 as euclidean time and t, x2, ..xd as spatial co-ordinates then we can give an alternative
interpretation of the functional integral (ignoring the  factor for the time being) as the
vacuum expectation value

(13)
where | or i is the vacuum for the hamiltonian, hr, associated with the quantization
surfaces of constant x1 and t2 < t < t1. unlike the previous hamiltonian which depended
on t, this operator is independent of its associated time, x1. i is a compact notation
for the sources, so that

(14)

expanding (13) in powers of the sources and using hr to generate the x1-dependence of

suppose that we had computed the schrodinger functional for new sources obtained by
scaling x1, i(x1/, x2, ..xd), with  real and positive. then we would have obtained
the same expression as (16) but multiplied by  and with the hr in the denominators
replaced by  hr. we took  to be real and positive, but we can use this expression to
continue to the complex -plane. since the eigenvalues of hr are real we conclude that the
result is analytic in the whole plane with the negative real axis removed. this assumes
that we work to nite order in the sources, and that the spectral decomposition of (16) as

4

a sum over eigen-values of hr converges, as we should expect if the schrodinger functional
is nite. the terms in  in (12) do not aect this conclusion. by repeating the argument
with x1 interchanged with each of the other co-ordinates in turn we conclude that for
i (x)  i(x/) the schrodinger functional z[ 

i ] and consequently , [ , ] are
(to any nite order in the sources) analytic in  in the plane cut along the negative real
axis. since x  x/, t  t/ is an isometry of (1) it follows that

f , 

, [ , ] =  /,  /[ , ]

(17)

and we see that analyticity in  corresponds to the analyticity in time associated with
wick rotation. subject to the caveat that we work to nite order in the sources the
logarithm , [ , ], w, [ , ], is just a sum of products of terms appearing in (16)
so it too is analytic in the cut -plane when it is evaluated for the scaled sources.

we can use (16) to justify a local expansion for w, [ , ] with a non-zero radius of
convergence. since hr is the hamiltonian for a eld theory on a nite spatial interval
such that  vanishes at the ends there is a mass-gap of the order of 1/ for small  . when
the momenta kj are sucently small on the scale of this mass-gap we can expand the

denominators in the spectral decomposition of (16) in integer powers of p k, except for
the contribution of the vacuum, which is of the form 1/p k. the singular behaviour as
k  0 must disappear when we take the logarithm to ensure cluster decomposition. we
conclude that any term of nite order in the sources in w, [ , ] has a local expansion for
,  that vary sucently slowly with x. this will take the form w, [ , ] = r ddx(a2 +
b 2 + c2 + d22..) with a, b, c, .. depending on , . if the fourier transforms of
the sources have bounded support then ,  are slowly varying for large . since each
term in the expansion of w, [ , ] has a simple dependence on , we have that for
large  the functional w, [ , ] = dr ddx (a2 + b 2 + c2/ + d22/2...
the powers of  are d/2 + integer so we conclude that the cut on the negative real axis
in dw, [ , ] runs only a nite distance from the origin.

we will now exploit the analyticity to obtain the logarithm of the partition function
log z[] = lim, 0 w, [0, ] from the small  behaviour, which is computable from
a power series solution of the schrodinger equation. (we take  = limx  = 0.) for
simplicity we assume continuity in  at the origin, and consider w /,0[ , ]. in general
there will need to be some  -dependent renormalization in order that the limit as   
exists, including wave-function renormalization, ren = qz( ), this will be the case even
for free massive elds at tree-level. given that  is a scalar the isometry x  x
implies that the functional takes the form

as z( )   2q then niteness of the limit of (21) requires that for large  , ( 22) 
( 2 2)d/2+q, and our problem is to calculate  and q. the general term in (19)
should depend on  as m,n(1, .., n+m)   d+(n+m)qfm,n(1, ..,n+m) and we need
to calculate fm,n. now our previous arguments imply that (1/) is analytic in the
complex plane with a nite cut extending from the origin along the negative real axis so
we can evaluate the following integral

i() =

1

2i zc

d


e (1/)

(22)

in two ways. we take c to be a circle centred on the origin and large enough for us to be
able to use the local expansions (20) to give

i() =



xn=0

fnn
n!

(23)

the integral may also be evaluated by collapsing the contour c onto the cut. let this
consist of a small circle about the origin, of radius , and two lines close to the negative
real axis running from the circle to the end of the cut. the contribution from the latter
is suppressed if the real part of  is large and positive. that from the circle is controlled
by the large time behaviour

d/2+q+1 = d/2+q  1

(24)

and for large  this is d/2+q/(d + 2q + 1). so, as the real part of  tends to + we
obtain

i() =



xn=0

fnn
n! 

d/2+q
(d + 2q)!

(25)

enabling us to compute  and q from a knowledge of the local expansion alone. now for

positive real , pn=0 fnn is an alternating series with nite radius of convergence. by
comparing terms with those of exp(constant) it follows that this converges for all  and
so we can take  large, even though this series is in positive powers of . furthermore,
as we shall see in some examples below, we obtain a good approximation to the large 
limit by truncating the series at some order, and then taking  as large as is consistent
with the truncation, i.e. so that the term of highest order in  is a small fraction of the
sum. this generalizes in an obvious way to the other terms in (18).

if we were to take d to be an even positive integer the relations for the fn would break
down, thus keeping d variable regulates the solution for fn. note that there is no need
to solve these relations further as they are ideally suited to numerical evaluation of the
coecients.

to illustrate the calculation of  and q take the example of d = 3. our discussion
will involve numerical computations. although the rest of this paper is concerned with
analytic results the numerical work of this section highlights the use of the derivative
expansions and is readily generalisable to interacting theories [5]. from (25) we have
that for large , i()  d(log(i())/d(log())  d/2 + q. truncating the innite series
to its rst n terms, sn (), gives an approximation to this. in figure 1 we have shown
sn  d(log(sn ())/d(log()) for n = 50 and n = 49. the two curves rapidly settle
down to a value of approximately 1.5 for  > 50 but separate noticeably at   300 above
which the truncated series cease to be good approximations to i(). we estimate d/2 + q
by taking  = 290 where the separation between the two curves is about 0.5 106, which
is much less than the error e obtained by approximating the limiting value of i by its
value for nite . this gives d/2 + q  s50(290) = 1.500017. the error is obtained by
studying how i()/d/2+q settles down to a constant value. for small  the approach to
a constant value is controlled by exponential terms that originate from the suppression of
the contribution of the cut, but for larger  the error is dominated by power corrections
to the small  behaviour of (1/). a plot of (s50()/1.5  s50(290)/2901.5)2.6 reveals
oscillations of roughly equal amplitude approximately equal to 12, so that the error in
approximating the    value of i()/d/2+q is of order 12/2.6 leading to an estimate
of the error e = 2 105. so we conclude that q = 0 to the accuracy of our calculations.
having obtained q we can estimate  from the  = 290 value of s50(2.5)/1.5 as 0.999998

with an error of 105. we have repeated the calculation of q for various values of d.
the results are shown in figure 2. we have plotted our estimate of q (multiplied by d3
to make the results for large d visible) for d varying in steps of 0.025 from 0.05 to 10.5.
the results are consistent with q = 0, which is the exact result of [2]. by calculating a
few values of  we guessed that its dependence on d is given by

and we test this by plotting in fig 3 our numerical estimates of  divided by the right
hand side of (29) for the same range of d as before. from this, and q = 0 we conclude
that the -dependence of the ads partition function is given by

the calculation of a in (27) requires the introduction of a regulator into the functional
laplacian of (8). we will do this with a cut-o on the eigenvalues, k2 of 2, restricting
them to be less than 1/( 2s) where s is the square of a xed proper distance. thus we
replace d(x) in (27) by

(cid:16)s 22 + 1(cid:17) d(x) = zk2<1/( 2s)

numerical investigation of this suggests that  = d + 1. the ultraviolet divergence of a

the eect of adding a mass term to the action, v () = m2 2 can be understood quite
simply by a change of variables back to the massless action. if we set  = tr in the

a non-trivial limit occurs for positive p + 1, which means that r is the positive root of

4 conformal anomaly for scalar fields

so far we have worked with a boundary sphere in which the curvature is eectively placed
at spatial innity. to discuss the conformal anomaly it will be more convenient to smooth
this out, so instead of the metric (1) we will now use

ds2 =

(47)

1

t2 
dt2 +xi,j

gij dxi dxj
 .

with i, j = 1..d. we take gij to be the metric of a d-dimensional sphere of large radius,
r, obtained, for example, by stereographic projection onto the plane parametrized by
x. the conformal anomaly measures the response of the free energy, which is the eld
independent part of log z, to a weyl transformation of gij. we wish to compute this as
r   when we recover the ads metric (1). when the boundary is a two-dimensional
sphere the free energy should change by r d2xgr c/(48) = c/6 when gij = gij 
where r is the curvature of the boundary and c the central charge of the virasoro algebra.
more generally there will be a conformal anomaly when the boundary has an even number
of dimensions, 2n say. we will continue to keep d a continuous variable allowing it to
tend to 2n at the end of our calculations. now log z[] = lim, 0 w, [0, ] so
we need to compute w, [0, ] in the presence of the curved metric gij, which we can
still do using our previous technique. since r   it will be sucent to nd the free
energy from a derivative expansion. in this section we consider the scalar eld. we will
discuss a free massive theory, because at one-loop the calculation is the same as for an
interacting scalar theory. the schrodinger equation takes the same form as before, (8),

provided that  and  acquire a factor of det g and that  is the covariant derivative

constructed from gij, and the solution is again of the form (18), but with a no longer
constant, but depending on gij and  .
if we set gij = ij + hij(x), and treat hij as
a source in the same way that we treated  and  as sources, we can generalize our
earlier discussion to argue that w, [ , , g
ij] is analytic in the cut -plane, where
ij(x) = gij(x/). again, this allows us to reconstruct the large  solution of the
g
schrodinger equation from the small  solution for which we have the local expansion (20).
by using gij the schrodinger functional can be made invariant under reparametrizations
of the space-like variables, giving

w, [ , , g

ij] = w, [ , , gij] = w /, /[ , , gij],

(48)

which rstly shows that the functional evaluated for the scaled elds is the same as the
weyl transformed functional, and secondly that this transformation can be absorbed into
a rescaling of  and . this implies that w, [ , ] is analytic in the complex  -plane
cut along the negative real axis. in particular, since the part that is quadratic in  is

dr ddx ( 22) , it follows that (( 2/)2) is analytic in the cut -plane. this
allows us to express ( 2/2) for arbitrary  in terms of the local expansion (20)

since the large contour, c, on which we can use the local expansion, (20), can be collapsed
to a contribution from the cut, which is suppressed for large positive  and the pole at

from the series expansions (28) we see that  = b0 = (p + 1) and for generic values

5 example: free fermion eld

another example is given by a free fermion theory. in order to describe this, it will be
necessary to discuss some subtleties arising from the representation of fermion elds.

wave functionals will be taken to be overlaps hu, u|i with a eld state hu, u|, upon
which fermion operators act as follows. we diagonalize half of the components of the
fermion elds

hu, u|q+  = 2q+uhu, u|
hu, u| q = 2uqhu, u|,

(66)

where q = 1
are represented by functional dierentiation

2(1  q) are for the moment arbitrary projection operators. the other half

 =

hu, u|q
hu, u| q+ =

1
2
1

uhu, u|
q+hu, u|.

q

u

(67)

we can make the dependence of the eld state on the grassmann-valued source elds
explicit by writing

where hq| is dened by

hu, u| = hq| exp2 trz ddx(uq
hq|q+  = hq| q = 0.

  q+u),

(68)

(69)

thus the choice of q corresponds to a choice of dirac sea, though not a physical dirac
sea; these constraints are merely artifacts of our choice of representation. on the other
hand this choice should not be considered completely arbitrary; since the eld-states
parametrized by hq| are non-physical, we must be careful that their overlaps with physi-
cal states are well-dened and non-vanishing. also, we may wish to include gauge inter-
actions; if we want wave-functionals to be invariant under local gauge transformations,

15

we nd that we must choose q to be a local, eld independent operator. in particular,
if we choose q to be projectors onto +ve/-ve energy eigenstates, the resulting wave-
functionals do not satisfy gauss law [13],[14]. for reasons that will become clear, in ads
space we will choose q = 0.

(73)

written in the form (71) or (73), the representation is reducible, but we are free to

take

and

qu = uq+ = 0,

q+v = vq = 0,

(74)

(75)

which removes the reducibility. to avoid taking functional derivatives with respect to
constrained elds, however, we nd it most convenient to work with the unconstrained
sources, and impose the constraints at the end of our calculations. the states |v, vi and
hu, u| depend only on the unconstrained components in any case, and the relative factor
of etrr ddx[uqu] appearing in hhu, u| merely ensures that we stay in the appropriate fock
space when we apply eld operators in accordance with (71) and (73).

imposing the constraints will nevertheless be of physical importance; for example in
the ads/cft correspondence they cause a dirac fermion in the ads theory to become
a chiral fermion in the boundary theory. this is in agreement with the ndings of other
authors, for example in [15].

now we are interested in the schrodinger functional

, [u, u, v, v] = hhu, u|t exp(z 



dt h(t))|v, vii,

(76)

16

so we need to nd the overlap hhu, u|v, vii which is the coincident time limit of the above.
the denitions (69) and (70) give rise to the following equations:

0 = (  

2u)qhhu, u|v, vii
= q(  + 2v)hhu, u|v, vii
= (  + 2v)q+hhu, u|v, vii
2u)hhu, u|v, vii,
= q+(  

(77)

where we have used the canonical commutation relations. the eld operators in (77) may
be represented by either pair of source elds, and the equations solved to give

hhu, u|v, vii = exp trz ddx(uqu  u2qv + v2q+u + vqv).

we are now ready to consider the ads metric (1). with the choice of vielbein

the euclidean action is given by1

(81)

and for m = 0 it coincides with the at-space action. as in the bosonic case, if we also put
t = ln t, the volume element in the corresponding path-integral becomes the usual at-

(71) for  and . the integrands in (68) and (78) do not aquire a factor from the metric,
as this has been absorbed into the denition of the elds.

space one induced by ||||2 = r dt dx . thus we can make use of the representation
the partition function is again given by the   0,    limit of the schrodinger
functional, with u = u = lim|x| v(x) = lim|x| v(x) = 0. in path-integral form the
schrodinger functional is

if  and  are integrated over freely then we can shift them by solutions to the clas-
sical equations of motion. choosing these solutions to satisfy the boundary conditions
corresponding to (66)

t =  :
t =  :

2qv, q+ = 
q = 
q+ = 2u, q = 2uq

2vq+

(84)

causes the action to separate into a piece depending only on the integration variables and a
piece depending only on the classical solution. our boundary term sb is thus determined
by the conditions (66). note that the classical action does not vanish, and there is
therefore no need to add any additional boundary term with undetermined coecients,
as in [15]. (other authors have discussed boundary terms for fermions [16]-[17]).

now the logarithm of the partition function is obtained as lim w,0[0, 0, v, v],

where w,0[u, u, v, v] = log ,0[u, u, v, v] may be expanded in analogy with (18) as

z ddxnf + u( 0ii)u + u( 0ii)v + v( 0ii)u + v( 0ii)vo .

n+m(1(1)n). the
boundary condition is satised if a0 = 1 and m  0, and we can explicitly sum the series
in terms of bessel functions. in momentum space

.

next, as may again be veried by substitution, the equation for  has the solution

 = 2q+( + q)1

= 2q+e1,

which gives the expected divergent behaviour at  = 0.

now consider the equation for . we can rewrite  in the following way:

 = (  + q+)1(   q+) where

which satises   h = 0. this enables us to nd the solution

 = q+(e  o).

 = 2(  + q)1q

= 2qe1.

(94)

(95)

finally, to solve the equation for  we put  = r+q where r satises {r, q} = 0.

substituting into (88) gives

now dene o, e such that o  o, e  e as m  m. the correponding expansion
coecients an are divergent as m  1/2 approaches an integer, so we keep m variable,
allowing it to approach such values within convergent expressions. this is the analogue
of keeping d variable in the scalar case. the necessity for such regularisation is due to
our working in momentum space, rather than conguration space. using the identity
e e  o o = 1, we nd that r =  1

causing the bessel functions to cancel because then c diverges and we have a similar
situation to that which we encountered in the bosonic case.

the large  behaviour of  is easily found:

fourier transforming, we nd that the partition function is given by

log z[v, v] = z ddxddyv(x) k0   (x  y)
(m1/2)!d/2 . here we have imposed the constraints (74). this is the correct
now all this assumed that m  0; but if m < 0 the above argument holds with m
replaced by m provided we take q = 0. thus we conclude that the scaling dimension
is d/2 + |m| in general.
an incidental point of interest is the relationship of our solution of the schrodinger
equation to the classical eld conguration  to which it corresponds. this is not quite
the same as the solution  to the dirac equation which we found, because the latter is
divergent as   . however, dening  by    as m  m, we nd that p  also
solves the dirac equation. taking a suitable linear combination of these two solutions
(and allowing them to operate on the boundary value v) we can construct a unique eld
conguration which satises the appropriate boundary conditions and is nite as   .
by fourier transforming this conguration, we found that it coincides exactly with that
given in [15] (when we change back to the variables in the original action).

now that we have found ,0, we can construct ,  from the self-reproducing prop-

erty. the inner-product of wave-functionals follows from (78):

h1|2i = z dududvdvh1|u, uihu, u|v, vihv, v|2i
= z dududvdvh1|u, uihv, v|2ie2vu2uv.

(100)

it is important to note that we integrate over the constrained elds, (74), which reect
the true functional dependence of the wave-functionals. this allows us to drop the q-
dependence from , etc. so we write the logarithm of ,  as

z ddxnf,  + u, u + u, v  v, u + v, vo ,

(101)

and we have ,0 = 2oe1, ,0 = 2e1, and ,0 = 2 oe1. note that ,0 = ,0.
then from
,0[u, u, v, v] = z ddxdududvdv, [u, u, u, u] ,0[v, v, v, v]e2vu2uv,

(102)

we obtain

from this we can check that as   
6= 0 the schrodinger functional ,  reduces to
hu, u|v, vi as it should.
we can calculate the conformal anomaly in the same way as before. working with
the metric (47) the schrodinger equation is unchanged, except that derivatives become
covariant with respect to g and the hamiltonian density aquires a factor of g. we need to
introduce a uv regulator, which we would like to write in terms of a heat-kernel expansion,
so it is convenient to re-express everything in terms of positive denite operators. hence,
for example, we rewrite the solution (92) as

for generic values of the mass m the conformal anomaly can be computed from expansions
of ,  and ,  in powers of d. these expansions both begin with terms of order d.
using these in (107) and (108) gives vanishing contributions to the anomaly. there are
also contributions from trhq which cancel between (107) and (108). so for generic values
of the mass the conformal anomaly is zero. but due to the divergent nature of ,0 as

leading order term proportional to 1/d which combines with the d in h to give a nite
contribution as   0. we conclude that the conformal anomaly is zero unless 2|m| is
an odd integer 2 n  1. for a four-dimensional boundary these are precisely the values
appearing in the mass spectrum of supergravity compactied on ads5  s5 [19], and
for a six-dimensional boundary they coincide with the mass spectrum of supergravity

6 gravitational sector

the tree-level conformal anomaly of pure gravity has been calculated for ads3 using
the chern-simons formulation, [8]-[9].
in higher dimensions it has been computed by
solving the einstein equations perturbatively in terms of boundary data, [10]. we will
now show how our schrodinger functional technique reproduces these results in a simple
fashion. our method employs a somewhat dierent regularization procedure, and so it
is important to show that it is consistent with earlier calculations. the main dierence
is that authors of [10] eectively compute the classical free energy of the gravitational
sector by nding w,  for  =  and  a small regulator, whereas we take  = 0 and
treat  as a large regulator. (since we will work at tree-level it is not necessary to keep
 non-zero as we did in the earlier computations of one-loop anomalies).

formally we need to compute the euclidean functional integral that represents a state

of pure gravity, with einstein-hilbert action and cosmological constant  < 0,

z[grs] = z dg exp(cid:18)z dd+1xg(r + 2) + boundary terms(cid:19)

(118)

where we should integrate over all metrics g of a d + 1 dimensional manifold which
induce the metric grs on the boundary. this is ill-dened for a variety of reasons, such
as non-renormalizability and unboundedness of the action, which we ignore in the hope
that these pathologies are absent from the more fundamental theory of which this is only
a part. the integral over all metrics includes reparametrizations which can be factored
out using the faddeev-popov method. the standard adm decomposition of the metric
is

(g) =   n 2 + ninjgij nj

gij !

ni

with gij the inverse of the d  d matrix gij. we will x the gauge by choosing

n 2 = l2/t2, ni = 0, gij =

gij + hij

t2

(119)

(120)

with t = x0. the dynamical variables are just the hij, and we take the boundary to
be at t =  = 0, where hij = 0. the gauge conditions should be accompanied by the
introduction of ghosts, but these will not contribute to the tree-level conformal anomaly.
expanding the action in powers of hij, and taking l2 = d(d  1)/(2) gives

(121)

where the boundary terms are chosen to make the action quadratic in rst derivatives of
hij, and the dots denote terms of higher order in hij. indices are raised and lowered with
gij. r(g) is the d-dimensional curvature calculated by taking gij as metric and g(r(g) +
hij gij + hij 2ijklhkl are the rst three terms in the expansion of qdet(g + h) r(g + h),

23

so that 2 is a second order dierential operator. the terms of higher order in h each
contain one or two derivatives. as in section (1) the state z[gij] is the    limit of the
schrodinger functional. the the tree-level contribution to log z[grs] is thus the   
limit of minus the action evaluated on shell for a manifold with boundaries at t = 0,
where the induced metric is gij, and t =  where it is gij + hij.
if we denote this as
w tree
,0 [gij + hij, gij] then it satises the hamilton-jacobi equation, (which is the tree-level
schrodinger equation). this is simply the statement that w tree
 +,0 can be obtained from
w tree
,0 by allowing the elds to propagate according to the equations of motion from  to
 +  , i.e.

w tree

 +,0[gij + hij +  hij, gij] = w tree

and the initial condition is that exp w tree

apart from a constant term in 0, only the rst term on the right has no derivatives of
either hij or gij, and so provides the dominant behaviour as   0, satisfying the initial
condition (provided hi
i is suitably treated, [11]). substituting into (124) and equating
powers of hij gives

the free energy is the innite  limit of the hij independent part of (126), i.e. f [, gij] =

scaling of  , so for gij =  gij the change in f is given by

up to terms involving two derivatives, we have from (124)

solving this for 1 and substituting into (128) gives the variation as an expansion in
powers of  times the curvatures constructed from gij. we want to work at nite  , so
our expansion will be valid when we take the curvatures to zero.

now for d = 2 we have identically gij = 0, so 1 = 0 and to the order we need (128)

from which we can identify the central charge as c = 24l, or, since we have chosen units
such that the three-dimensional gravitational constant satises 16gnewton = 1, we have
c = 3l/(2gnewton) as in [8].
for d = 4 we obtain 1 to the desired order from (129) as 1 = l 2 gij/2, so if we
substitute into (127) we have

this becomes

7 conclusions

we have interpreted the partition function for elds in euclideanized anti de sitter space-
time as a limit of the schrodinger functional. this allows canonical methods to be used, in
contrast to the usual approach based on greens functions. the former have the advantage
of separating out the time-dependence, and as a consequence we have been able to compute
one-loop eects in the ads theory by solving the functional schrodinger equation, (as well
as reproducing known tree-level results such as the scaling of two-point functions and the
gravitational conformal anomaly). although we have only studied the simplest one-loop
quantity, namely the anomalous scaling of the free energy for scalar and fermionic theories,
these canonical methods can be expected to apply to more complicated objects such as
n-point functions, as they do in at space [5]-[7].

our computation of the one-loop conformal anomalies for scalar and fermionic theories
shows that for generic values of the mass the anomalies vanish, but for special values
the anomalies have integer coecients. for example, when the boundary of the ads
spacetime is two-dimensional the virasoro central charges are positive integers, n, when

the mass of the scalar eld is q n 2  1 and when the mass of the fermion is n  1/2. this

implies that for generic values of the mass, the boundary cfts for the scalar or fermi
elds alone are non-unitary, since in a unitary theory a vanishing central charge implies
an absence of quasi-primaries. when the boundary is four dimensional the conditions on
the scalar and fermion masses for the conformal anomaly to be non-zero coincide with the
mass spectra resulting from kaluza-klein compactication of supergravity on ads5 s5,
and when it is six dimensional they coincide with the mass spectra resulting from kaluza-
klein compactication of supergravity on ads7 s4. we expect that the same is true for
the other elds in the supergravity theory, and this would make the one-loop corrections
to the tree-level calculation of [10] that checks the maldacena conjecture an intriguing
prospect.
