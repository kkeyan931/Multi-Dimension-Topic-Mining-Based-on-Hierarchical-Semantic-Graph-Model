we study little string theory in a weak coupling limit dened in [1].

10/99

1. introduction

little string theories (lsts) are non-local theories without gravity which can be

dened by studying the dynamics on n s5-branes in the limit in which the string coupling
gs  0 [2] (see also [3,4]). an alternative (and possibly more general) denition of these
theories is obtained by studying string theory on

ird1,1  m2n ,

(1.1)

where m2n is a singular calabi-yau (cy) n-fold (2n = 10  d). in the limit gs  0 the
modes that propagate in the bulk of m2n decouple and one nds a non-trivial theory living
at the singular locus of m2n. in some cases the two denitions are related by t-duality
[5,6,7,8].

a large class of examples is obtained by studying cy n-folds m2n (1.1) with an
isolated quasi-homogenous hypersurface singularity. near such a singularity, m2n can be
described as the hypersurface f (z1,    , zn+1) = 0 in cn+1, where f is a quasi-homogenous
polynomial with weight one under za  raza, i.e.

f (raza) = f (za) ,   c ,

(1.2)

for some set of positive weights ra.

finding a useful description of lsts is an important open problem.

in [9] it was

proposed to study them using holography (see also [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17]). in [18] it

was further argued that the non-gravitational d-dimensional theory at a general singularity

f (za) = 0 is dual to string theory in the background

ird1,1  ir  s1  lg(w = f ) ,

where ir is the real line, labeled by , along which the dilaton varies linearly,

 = 

q
2

 ,

(1.3)

(1.4)

and lg(w = f ) is a landau-ginzburg n = 2 scft of n + 1 chiral superelds za with

superpotential w (za) = f (za) (1.2). o-shell physical observables in lst correspond to

on-shell observables in string theory on (1.3). o-shell greens functions in lst correspond

to on-shell correlation functions in the dual string theory.

1

the description (1.3) is useful at large  where the string coupling e  0 and the
theory is weakly coupled. one can use it to identify o-shell observables in lst (which

correspond in the dual description to wavefunctions which are exponentially supported at
  ) and study their transformation properties under the symmetries of the theory
[9]. correlation functions are governed by the region of nite , and therefore computing
them requires knowledge of the strong coupling dynamics at   . perturbative
string theory in the vacuum (1.3) is singular and does not provide a good guide for such

correlation functions.

the strong coupling singularity at    in (1.3), (1.4) can be avoided by replacing
the cylinder ir  s1 in (1.3) by the scft on the cigar sl(2)/u (1) (or equivalently [1]
n = 2 liouville). in the dual theory this corresponds [18,1] to resolving the singularity

f (za) = 0 to

f (z1,    , zn+1) =  ,

and taking the limit   0, gs  0 with the ratio

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

(see [18,1] for the details). the value of the string coupling at the tip of the cigar is 1/;

hence, by making  large one obtains a weakly coupled theory, double scaled little string

theory (dslst), in which correlation functions have a 1/ expansion.

to summarize, the non-gravitational d-dimensional theory which lives at the resolved
singularity (1.5) in the double scaling (decoupling) limit , gs  0 with  (1.6) held xed
is dual to string theory in the background

ird1,1 

sl(2)k
u (1)  lg(w = f ) ,

(1.8)

where k is the level of sl(2) (it is related to (1.7), k = 1/r [18]). one can think of (1.8)
as the near horizon geometry of the resolved singularity f =  (1.5) [19].

an interesting example of the construction is the d = 6 theory of k parallel n s5-

branes. in that case one has

f (z1, z2, z3) = zk

1 + z2

2 + z2
3 ,

(1.9)

2

and the manifold f (za) = 0 is an ale space (the singular geometry which is t-dual to the

vebrane near horizon background). the low energy limit of the theory on k n s5-branes

in type iib string theory is su (k) gauge theory with (1, 1) susy (a non-chiral theory

with sixteen supercharges); for type iia vebranes one nds at low energies a mysterious

non-abelian generalization of the theory of self-dual b elds, with chiral (2, 0) susy

and conformal invariance (see e.g. [20] for a review). at high energies both the iia and

iib theories are expected to have a hagedorn density of states, but unlike ordinary critical

string theories they do not contain gravity and do have well dened o-shell greens

functions.

the dual background (1.3) is in this case ir5,1  ir  s1  su (2)k/u (1). the gso
projection acts as a zk orbifold on s1  su (2)k/u (1), turning it into su (2)k wzw,
the cft on a three-sphere. this theory has an su (2)l  su (2)r symmetry which in
the vebrane language is the so(4) r-symmetry of rotations in the ir4 transverse to the

branes [21].

turning on  (1.5) corresponds in the vebrane language to distributing the vebranes

k (see [1] for details). parametrizing
at equal distances around a circle of radius r0  ls
the ir4 transverse to the branes by two complex variables a, b, the vebrane theory
includes two k  k matrices of complex scalar elds which we also denote by a, b. these
scalars belong to the same susy multiplets as the su (k) gauge eld in type iib, and the

1

non-abelian self-dual b eld and an additional real adjoint scalar in the iia theory.

the double scaling limit (1.5) - (1.7) corresponds to studying the theory at a point in

its coulomb branch where, say,

hai =0
hbi =mw msdiag(e

2i

k , e

4i

k ,    , e

2ik

k ) .

(1.10)

in type iib string theory, this higgses the su (k) gauge symmetry down to u (1)k1 with
the mass of the charged gauge bosons mjl  mw|e
k |. these gauge bosons
correspond to the ground states of d-strings stretched between the n s5-branes; thus,

k  e

2ij

2il

mw is related to r0 via

mw 

r0
s  ms .
gsl2

(1.11)

therefore, the double scaling limit is in this case the decoupling limit with the mass of the

w -bosons held xed.

3

in the iia theory we have instead d2-branes stretched between the n s5-branes; these

look like strings in the vebranes, charged under the respective self-dual b elds on the
vebranes. the tensions of these strings are proportional to mjlms. they are held nite
in the double scaling limit.

distributing the branes as in (1.10) breaks the r-symmetry

so(4)  so(2)  zk .

(1.12)

the charges of a and b under these symmetries are (1, 0) and (0, 1), respectively.

in

the dual picture (1.8), the so(2) and zk charges correspond to momentum and winding
around the cigar, respectively1 (recall that in the cigar cft, momentum around the cigar

is conserved, while winding number is not).

2. observables in dslst

we are interested in constructing brst invariant observables in string theory on

(1.8). we will focus on (ns,ns) sector elds, since the rest of the observables can be

obtained from these by applying the spacetime supercharges [18]. such observables are

linear combinations of vertex operators of the form (see [1,18] for details)

ow,m, m(k) = e w, eikx

vj;m, m ,

(2.1)

where k ( = 0, 1,    , d 1) is the momentum along ird1,1 and w,  is a rather general
operator2 with scaling dimension (, ) in the scft on (1.8). vj;m, m is a virasoro
primary on sl(2)/u (1). its scaling dimensions are

j;m, m =

m2  j(j + 1)

k

; j;m, m =

m2  j(j + 1)

k

,

where (m, m) run over the set

m =

1
2

(p + wk) ; m = 

1
2

(p  wk) .

(2.2)

(2.3)

1 in the language of [18], the so(2) and zk charges are 1

2 (r  r) and 1

2 (r + r) mod k,

respectively.

2 by a gauge choice it can be set to be the identity on the cigar, and it will be convenient to

do that below.

4

one can think of p as the momentum number around the cigar (which is conserved) and w

as the winding number (which is not). in cft on sl(2)/u (1) both p and w are integers.

string theory on (1.8) further includes a chiral orbifold (the gso projection) acting non-
trivially on sl(2)k/u (1)  lg(w = f ) in (1.8). the twisted sectors contain in general
operators with non-integer winding number w which is conserved modulo one; p remains

integer.

the on-shell condition requires (the coecient of e  in) (2.1) to be a bottom

component of a worldsheet n = 1 supereld, and in addition to satisfy (we will usually

set ms = 1 from now on)

the chiral gso projection further requires

(2.4)

(2.5)

where qlg is the charge of w,  under the u (1)r symmetry which belongs to the left-
moving n = 2 superconformal algebra in lg(w = f ), and fl is the left-moving fermion
number on ird1,1. a similar relation holds for the right-movers. unitarity of the near
horizon cft, which is an orbifold of sl(2)/u (1)  lg(w = f ), implies that j belongs
to one of the following two regions (for early work on unitarity of sl(2)/u (1) see [22]):

+ iir ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where lg is the contribution to  of the lg model in (1.8). o-shell observables in
the d-dimensional lst correspond to wave-functions on the cigar that are exponentially
supported far from the tip, at   . therefore, only vertex operators in the range (2.6)
give rise to such observables. operators in the range (2.7) are  function normalizable,

and correspond to uctuating elds in lst.

5

note that the bound on j (2.6) implies via (2.4) that o-shell physical observables (2.1)
are only dened in a nite range of values of kk. this issue will be further discussed
below.

it is instructive to apply the above discussion to the six dimensional theory of k

n s5-branes in type ii string theory. the string vacuum

ir5,1 

sl(2)k
u (1) 

su (2)k
u (1)

(2.8)

has the same r-symmetry, so(2)  zk, as the brane theory (1.12). the so(2) charge is
m  m = p (2.3), while the zk charge is (m + m) mod k.

in the vebrane theory there are two sets of chiral operators3:

tr ai ,

tr bi ,

i = 2,    , k .

(2.9)

the so(2)  zk charge of ai is (i, 0); that of bi is (0, i). in the string vacuum (2.8) they
are realized as follows:

eikx

vj;m,m

trb2m  e zk2m

where zi
(1.9)), and zi

1 are the chiral-chiral operators in the n = 2 minimal model su (2)/u (1) (see
1 are their chiral-antichiral analogs, which appear in the twisted sectors of the
gso orbifold. the following comments regarding the correspondence (2.10), (2.11) are in

order at this point:
(1) the so(2)  zk (see (1.12)) charges of the vertex operators on the r.h.s. of (2.10),
(2.11) are (0, 2m) and (2m, 0), respectively, in agreement with those of trb2m and
tra2m.

3 the k  k matrix scalar elds a and b were dened before equation (1.10). in dslst the
o-diagonal components of a, b are massive; the eigenvalues of the matrices are the light degrees

of freedom.

6

(2) the supersymmetry multiplet structure is the same. in particular, the vertex opera-

tors in (2.10), (2.11) preserve the same halves of the susy as the operators on the

l.h.s. [18].

(3) far from the tip of the cigar, where it looks like a cylinder, one recovers the background
ir  s3 studied in [9]. roughly speaking, large  corresponds to high energies on
the vebrane, a regime in which the higgs breaking due to (1.10) is negligible. the
vertex operators4 in (2.10), (2.11) approach for large  the graviton operators given

by eq. (3.6) in [9]. the identication (2.10), (2.11) agrees with the one proposed in

[9] in that limit.

(4) there are analogs of the vertex operators in (2.10), (2.11) with m 6= m. these
correspond to tram mbm+ m. such operators do not preserve any spacetime susy.

3. the two point functions

the cft on the cigar is related by the gko coset construction [23] to that on

ads3. the natural observables in cft on the euclidean version of ads3 (the manifold
h +
3 = sl(2, c)/su (2)) are functions j(x, x; z, z) which transform as primaries under
the sl(2)l  sl(2)r current algebra [24,25]. x is an auxiliary complex variable that is
useful for studying cft on ads3. the two point function of j is5

hj(x, x)j(x, x)i =

k


[(k)]2j+1 (1  2j+1
k )
( 2j+1
k )

|x  x|4(j+1) ,

where

(k) 

1


(1 + 1

.

(3.1)

(3.2)

for studying the coset it is convenient to fourier transform the elds j(x, x) and dene

the mode operators

j;m, m = z d2x xj+m xj+ mj(x, x) .

(3.3)

note that for (3.3) to make sense one needs m m  z; as discussed above (see (2.3)) this
is indeed always the case.

4 which can be thought of as tachyons from the d-dimensional perspective [18,1].
5 here and below we suppress the dependence of correlation functions on the worldsheet loca-

tions z, z.

7

the two point functions of the modes of  are equal to those of the sl(2)/u (1) coset

theory,

hvj;m, mvj;m, mi = hj;m, mj;m, mi

(3.4)

(the two dier by the two point function of exponentials in cft on s1, which is equal to
one6).

the two point function of (2.1) is a generalization of the one computed in [1] for

m = m using the results of [25]:

g2(k)  how,m, m(k)ow ,m, m(k)i = hw, w 

, ihvj;m, mvj;m, mi .

(3.5)

using (3.4), (3.3), (3.1) and the results of appendix a one nds

hvj;m, mvj;m, mi = k[(k)]2j+1 (1  2j+1

( 2j+1

k )(2j  1)(j  m + 1)(1 + j + m)

k )(2j + 2)(j  m)( m  j)

.

(3.6)

the two point function (3.6) has a series of poles; these can be interpreted as contributions

of on-shell states in dslst, which are created from the vacuum by the operator ow,m, m.

the masses of these states can be computed by using the relation (2.4) between j and
m 2 = kk. the resulting spectrum of masses can be analyzed as in [1]. restricting to
the region (2.6) gives rise to non-negative values of m 2 corresponding to

or

m = j + n; n = 1, 2, 3,   

m = (j + n); n = 1, 2, 3,   

(3.7)

(3.8)

these values of m and j belong to the principal discrete series representations of sl(2).

the corresponding states can be thought of as bound states that live near the tip of the

cigar [26]. without loss of generality, we will restrict to the set (3.7).

near m = j + n the two point function (3.5) takes the form

g2 = hw, w 
, i
j + n  m

k[(k)]2j+1 (1  2j+1

6 vj;m, m dened by (3.3), (3.4) is normalized such that far from the tip of the cigar it describes

an incoming wave with strength one (see eq. (3.10) in [1]).

where the    correspond to terms analytic near m = j + n. using (2.4), one can rewrite
(3.9) as

(3.13)

it is useful to note that:
(1) since m  m = p (2.3), we have m = j + n  p (recall that n, p  z).
(2) when | m|  j, the residue (3.13) vanishes due to a pole of ( m  j). this is in
agreement with the fact that, as explained in [1], physical particles correspond to the
principal discrete series representations (for which | m|  j + 1).

(3) if n > p, i.e. m = j + n, n = 1, 2,   , the residue (3.13) is positive for all n, in

agreement with the expected unitarity of the dslst.

(4) for n  p, comment (2) above implies that non-zero residues correspond to p n > 2j
and, furthermore, one must have 2j  z, in which case the pole of ( m  j) in the
denominator is cancelled by a pole of (1 + j + m) in the numerator. the sign of

the residue (3.13) does not vary with n.
it does depend on the observable under
consideration as ()2m+1, however, this dependence is insignicant. for example, one
can absorb it into the rules for hermitian conjugation7:

j;m, m = (cid:26) vj;m, m
v 

m m > 0
()2m+1vj;m, m m m < 0

(3.14)

7 a similar phenomenon occurs in su (2) wzw, where the su (2)l su (2)r symmetry implies
that the two point functions satisfy the relation hvj;m, mvj;m, mi = ()2mhvj;m, mvj;m, mi.

unitarity of the cft then implies that one should use conjugation rules that are similar to the

ones that appear here. another potential source of minus signs is the relation between observables

on sl(2) and sl(2)/u (1), (3.4).

9

to summarize, the two point function (3.5) exhibits a series of single poles, all of whose

residues have the same sign (for a given observable). this is consistent with the expected

unitarity of the d-dimensional theory.

in addition to the series of poles described above, the two point function (3.5) has
a branch cut in momentum space, since j is determined in terms of kk by solving the
quadratic equation (2.4). this branch cut starts at j = 1/2 and is due to the fact that the
operators ow,m, m can create from the vacuum the continuum of normalizable states in the
range (2.7). however, as discussed above, non-uctuating physical observables correspond

only to operators in the range (2.6) and, therefore, the role of both the branch cut and the

observables (2.7) is not clear.

the analysis of the mass spectrum provides another check of the identication of the

chiral operators (2.9) in the six dimensional vebrane theory, at the point (1.10) in its

coulomb branch, with the vertex operators (2.10), (2.11). the two point functions of
these operators have poles given by (3.12) with (zk2m
) = (k  2m)/2k.
the lowest lying states created by these operators from the vacuum correspond to n = 1

) = (zk2m

in (3.12), and are massless. thus, the operators (2.10), (2.11) create from the vacuum
4(k  1) real scalar elds with the quantum numbers of the massless scalars corresponding
to (2.9) in the vebrane theory.

there is however a puzzle associated with the above discussion. at low energies,

the eigenvalues of the matrices a, b are expected to be free massless elds. in free eld
theory, operators like (2.9) do not create single particle states from the vacuum: tr ai

(say) creates an i-particle state. put dierently, in free eld theory the two point function
htr ai(k)tr ai(k)i behaves at small momenta like (kk)2i3 log kk and not 1/k2
found in (3.5)  (3.13). we will discuss this puzzle further in section 5.

 as

4. the three point functions

to compute the couplings among the particle states with masses given by (3.12) we

next turn to the three point functions of the o-shell observables (2.1),

g3  how3,m3, m3ow2,m2, m2ow1,m1, m1i .

(4.1)

the momentum around the cigar, m m, is conserved; hence three point functions satisfy

m1 + m2 + m3 = m1 + m2 + m3 .

(4.2)

10

as is standard in fermionic string theory, to compute such three point functions we take
two of the operators to be in the 1 picture, and the third in the 0 picture. after evaluating
the ghost contributions, one nds:

g3 = hw3, 3 eik3xvj3;m3, m3w2, 2 eik2xvj2;m2, m2g 1

are the left and right-moving global n = 1 superconformal generators.

and g 1
there are apriori four contributions to (4.3): each of g1/2 and g 1

can act either on
w1eik1x or on vj1;m1, m1. the mixed terms in which the two supercharges act in dierent
sectors vanish due to (4.2) and the left and right-moving u (1)r n = 2 superconformal
symmetries. this leaves two contributions:

the second term in (4.4) is in general non-zero when m1 + m2 + m3 =  k

the u (1)r symmetries imply that the rst term vanishes unless m1 + m2 + m3 = 0. thus,
it corresponds to amplitudes for which both momentum (4.2) and winding are conserved.

can be decomposed into eigenstates of u (1)r,

(1) one can generalize the above arguments to n point functions. the correlation function
receives contributions that violate winding number by i units, with i = 0, 1,    , n 2.
(2) a related result was obtained by v. fateev, a.b. zamolodchikov and al.b. zamolod-

chikov (unpublished), who showed that the bosonic cft on sl(2)/u (1) has similar
properties: n point functions can violate winding number conservation by up to n 2
units.

we next turn to the calculation of the three point function (4.4). for simplicity, we will
present the result for the case where all three momenta mi  mi vanish, and the winding
number is conserved. in that case, only the rst line of (4.4) contributes. furthermore,

the analytic structure is determined by the three point function on the cigar,

hvj3;m3,m3vj2;m2,m2 vj1;m1,m1i ,

(4.5)

and we will focus on it below.

in the interpretation of the correlation function g3 as an o-shell greens function in

dslst, one expects (4.4), (4.5) to have poles at values of m and j corresponding to the

principal discrete series (3.7), (3.8). such poles would be due to the states found in section

3 (see (3.12)) going on mass shell. as in local qft, lsz reduction relates the residue of

these poles to the s-matrix element describing (say) the decay of one of these particles to

two others. below we will compute these matrix elements.

the three point function (4.5) is obtained from the appropriate correlation function

of sl(2)l sl(2)r primaries in cft on h +

3 , using the transform (3.3). as shown in [25],

hj3 (x3, x3)j2 (x2, x2)j1(x1, x1)i =
d(j3, j2, j1; k)|x1  x2|2(j3j1j21)|x1  x3|2(j2j1j31)|x2  x3|2(j1j2j31) ,

(4.6)

where

d(j3, j2, j1; k) =
g(j1  j2  j3  2)g(j3  j1  j2  1)g(j2  j1  j3  1)g(j1  j2  j3  1)

k
23 (k)j1+j2+j3+1

g(1)g(2j1  1)g(2j2  1)g(2j3  1)

(4.7)

.

g(j) is a special function, whose only properties that will be needed here are (see also

appendix a):

(1) it satises the recursion relation

g(j  1) =

(1 + j
k )
( j
k )

g(j) .

(4.8)

(2) g(j) has poles at the following values of j: j = n + mk, j = (n + 1)  (m + 1)k,

n, m = 0, 1, 2,   .

a potentially alarming aspect of (4.6), (4.7) is the appearance of singularities in the three

point couplings in string theory on ads3. one expects the spacetime theory to be a unitary

cft in which such singularities are unacceptable. upon a closer look one actually nds
that some singularities are acceptable. consider, for example, the factor g(j1 j2  j3  1)
in the numerator of (4.7). it has poles when j1j2j31 = n+mk or (n+1)(m+1)k
with n, m = 0, 1, 2,   . the bound (2.6) satised by j1, j2 and j3 eliminates most of these
poles and allows only those with

j1  j2  j3  1 = n = 0, 1, 2,   

(4.9)

12

these poles are harmless and even to some extent necessary. note that when (4.9) is valid,
the power of |x2  x3|2 in (4.6) is a non-negative integer, n. unless the structure constant
d(j1, j2, j3; k) develops a pole in this case, the correlation function (4.6) is supported at
zero momentum, since it is the fourier transform of a polynomial in x2  x3. the pole at
(4.9) replaces

1
|x2  x3|2(n+)  |x2  x3|2n log |x2  x3|2

(4.10)

whose fourier transform is a power of momentum, as required. the poles (4.9) will play

an important role below.

poles of (4.7) that cannot be interpreted as above (i.e. poles which persist after (4.6)

is fourier transformed to momentum space) are genuine pathologies, and must be avoided.
an example of such poles appeared already in the two point function (3.1) for j  (k1)/2;
those poles were excluded by the unitarity bound (2.6) (in fact, excluding these poles is

one way of deriving the bound [1]).

the three point function (4.6) has such poles when j1+j2+j3 = n+k1, n = 0, 1, 2,   .
these poles have to be excluded by unitarity as well. thus, we conclude that unitarity of

weakly coupled string theory on ads3 allows one to consider only three point functions
(4.6) with8

j1 + j2 + j3 < k  1 .

(4.11)

we next use the transform (3.3) and the fact that the three point function satises

hvj3;m3, m3vj2;m2, m2vj1;m1, m1i = hj3;m3, m3j2;m2, m2j1;m1, m1i ,

(4.12)

like the two point function9 (3.4). we nd

hvj3;m3,m3vj2;m2,m2vj1;m1,m1i = d(j3, j2, j1; k)
f (j3, m3; j2, m2; j1, m1)z d2x|x|2(m1+m2+m31) ,

where

f (j3, m3; j2, m2; j1, m1) = z d2x1d2x2|x1|2(j1+m1)|x2|2(j2+m2)
|1  x1|2(j2j1j31)|1  x2|2(j1j2j31)|x1  x2|2(j3j1j21) .

(4.13)

(4.14)

8 this constraint on the observables in three point functions may seem puzzling. we will return

to it in the next section.

9 the situation for n  4 point is more complicated.

13

the integral over x in (4.13) ensures winding number conservation m1 + m2 + m3 = 0.
the function f (4.14) does not seem to be expressible in terms of elementary functions.

to study the decay of on-shell states we must perform lsz reduction of the three

point function, i.e. evaluate f in the vicinity of its singularities. specically, since we are
interested (say) in the decay process 1  2 + 3, we focus on the residue of the rst order
pole at

m1 = (j1 + n1) ,

n1 = 1, 2, 3,   

(4.15)

which arises from the integration over x1 near zero in (4.14). this corresponds to an
incoming particle with mass determined by (3.12) (compare to (3.8)). one can show that

the residue of the pole at (4.15) has further singularities in the other external legs.

in

particular, one nds single poles in j2, j3 at

m2 = j2 + n2 ; m3 = j3 + n3 ,

n2, n3 = 1, 2, 3,   

(4.16)

corresponding to the outgoing particles 2 and 3. thus, near (4.15), (4.16), the correlator

(4.12) has the structure

hvj3;m3,m3vj2;m2,m2 vj1;m1,m1i =

r3,2,1

(j1 + n1 + m1)(j2 + n2  m2)(j3 + n3  m3)

+   

(4.17)

we will next compute the residue r3,2,1. winding number conservation and (4.15), (4.16)
imply that

j1  j2  j3 = n2 + n3  n1  n + 1

(4.18)

is an integer, which we denote by n + 1.

as described in appendix b, the residue r3,2,1 (4.17) vanishes for n < 0. thus, the
decay amplitude 1  2 + 3 vanishes in this case. for n  0 one nds (using results from
the appendices):

r3,2,1 (4.17), (4.19) times the contribution of ird1,1  lg(w = f ) to the rst line of
(4.4) gives the un-normalized on-shell three point coupling. to get the normalized on-shell

q3

to recapitulate, we computed the three point coupling of the on-shell states described in

section 3 for the case where the momentum around the cigar is zero, mi = mi, and the

winding number is conserved, p mi = 0. an incoming state corresponding to (4.15) can

decay into two states (4.16) if and only if

j1  j2 + j3 + 1 .

(4.22)

this selection rule is in fact a consequence of the underlying sl(2) symmetry, i.e. the fact

that for principal discrete series representations,

|j2i  |j3i = xj1j2+j3+1

|j1i .

(4.23)

an interesting question is whether the matrix element (4.21) has singularities for

dierent observables. the only possible source of such singularities is r3,2,1 (4.19). the
rst factor in r3,2,1, ( i
k ), is never singular since i  n and by using the denition of
n , (4.18), and the bounds (2.6) on the ji one can show that n < (k  1)/2 < k. the
second factor in (4.19) is likewise regular since j1 > n (2.6), (4.18), so 2j1 + 1  i > 0 for
i  n . the two remaining  functions in the numerator of (4.19) can similarly be shown
to be nite for values of j1, j2, j3 which satisfy the unitarity bound (2.6). thus, the decay

amplitude (4.21) is always nite for physical states.

5. discussion

the d-dimensional double scaled little string theory dened in [1] has the following

properties:

(1) a hagedorn density of states in a theory without gravity.

15

(2) the spectrum of the theory (3.12) includes some massless states, kaluza-klein type
excitations with masses of order ms/k, and a stringy spectrum which starts at
masses of order ms.

(3) the theory has well dened o-shell greens functions. the analytic structure of

these correlation functions is very reminiscent of local qft. in particular, the two

point functions have poles corresponding to the states (3.12). moreover, lsz reduc-

tion applies to the three point functions and can be used to study on-shell s-matrix

elements.

(4) the theory is weakly coupled at moderate energies. the weak coupling approximation

breaks down both at high energies and in some cases at very low ones.

the last point is related to a potentially puzzling aspect of our analysis. both here and in [1]

it was observed that to obtain sensible unitary amplitudes from the weak coupling analysis

of dslst one needs to restrict the observables in external legs of dierent correlation

functions. examples include the bound (2.6) which is necessary for unitarity of the two
point functions, and (4.11) that is needed to make sense of three point functions10. these

bounds cut o the allowed values of o-shell momenta in the euclidean regime. for

example, the stress-tensor of dslst is described in the bulk theory as an on-shell graviton
which is only dened for k2

 < 0.

the above bounds on momenta are clearly inconsistent with analyticity of o-shell

greens functions (it should be emphasized that on-shell s-matrix elements of the states

(3.12) are analytic in the mandelstam invariants). lst is a non-local theory, and it is not

clear apriori whether it should satisfy o-shell analyticity (see [14] for a recent discussion),

but assuming that it does (as is perhaps suggested by property (3) above), the bounds

must be reinterpreted. we would like to propose that these bounds are associated with the

breakdown of the weak coupling expansion in dslst. string loops are naively suppressed

by powers of 1/ (1.6), but it is possible that as one approaches the boundaries of the

region (2.6), say, loop corrections become large and invalidate the perturbative analysis.

thus, at least some of the bounds (2.6), (4.11) might not be bounds on observables in

correlation functions but rather on the reliability of the perturbative analysis of various

correlation functions. it would clearly be interesting to compute loop corrections to the

two and three point functions we considered here and check this directly.

10 in fact, as mentioned above, these bounds are needed in string theory on ads3 as well, for

similar reasons.

16

down at long distances (k2

for the stress-tensor of dslst described above, string perturbation theory breaks
 = 0). it is perhaps not surprising that the bulk description
breaks down in this regime, since the boundary theory (low energy dslst) is free at

low energies  e.g. in the six dimensional example it is the free theory on k separated

n s5-branes. in the ads/cf t correspondence when the boundary theory is free in the

ir, the bulk theory typically becomes strongly coupled there. usually, the strong coupling

is associated with large curvatures in the bulk geometry rather than large corrections from

string loops, but we have to recall that the near-horizon geometry of k n s5-branes, which

is a multi-center chs solution [21], is related to the geometry (2.8) by t-duality, which

smooths out the large curvature of the multi-center solution, apparently at the price of

introducing large string loop corrections.

unlike anti-de-sitter space, string theory in asymptotically linear dilaton backgrounds

of the sort studied in [9] and here has observables corresponding to wave-functions that are

 function normalizable in the radial () direction. these observables are needed to con-

struct o-shell operators in lst with arbitrarily large negative d-dimensional momentum
k2
. the role of these observables in the theory is puzzling, since they seem to correspond
to uctuating elds in lst and not to external sources, whose norm should diverge from
large . excluding them seems to put a lower bound on the allowed values of k2

 for each

observable, which violates o-shell analyticity. note that:

(1) the issue of the physical nature of the  function normalizable operators is separate

from the discussion of the perturbative unitarity bounds above. in particular, it should

not involve strong coupling eects in the bulk string theory. computing the tree

level four point function of the observables studied here should shed light on the role

of the  function normalizable operators in the theory.

(2) the fate of the  function normalizable observables is related to another open problem.

in [1] and here we discussed the physics of states with a discrete spectrum of masses in d

dimensions. the bulk string theory has in addition a continuum of states, which show
up in the o-shell correlation functions as branch cuts at values of k2

 corresponding
to the  function normalizable states. the fate of this continuum in lst is hence tied

to these observables.

another set of puzzles is related to the maximally supersymmetric six dimensional

case. consider e.g. k n s5-branes in iib string theory. we studied the system in a regime

where the vebranes are separated such that the energy of the ground states of d-strings

that stretch between the vebranes, which is of order mw , is much larger than the other

17

scales in the problem, ms, ms/k. one might expect that the vebranes would not
interact in this limit, and the full theory would split into a set of k decoupled theories

living on the dierent vebranes.
it is believed that there is no non-trivial theory on
a single vebrane; therefore, one would expect lst to be trivial for mw  ms. we
nevertheless nd a non-trivial theory with a complicated k dependent spectrum of masses

(3.12) and interactions (the simplest of which  the three point couplings  are described

in section 4).

an example of this problem was mentioned at the end of section 3. the analysis
of the two point functions in section 3 leads one to conclude that the operators tr ai
(2.9) create massless single particle states, which therefore carry charge i = 2, 3,    , k
under the unbroken so(2) symmetry of the vacuum. at low energies one expects to nd a
u (1)k1 gauge theory with 16 supercharges in which a is a diagonal matrix of scalar elds,

whose eigenvalues create single particle states with so(2) charge 1. thus, the spectrum

of massless particles we nd seems to disagree (as far as the so(2) quantum number is

concerned) with what one expects from gauge theory.

one possible resolution of the above discrepancies is that there is a subtlety that

has been ignored in the relation of string theory on the manifold (2.8) and the theory

on separated vebranes. for example, it could be that in the vebrane theory a has an

expectation value as well as b, and the so(2) invariance is restored by summing in some

way over dierent expectation values.

another possibility is that the identication of the vebrane system is correct, and

our results point to interesting strong coupling eects that exist in this theory at the string

scale ms, even when mw is very large. this is needed to explain the r-charge spectrum

of the massless particles and might also help explain the spectrum (3.12). imagine turning

on mw continuously in the theory of k initially coincident vebranes. for mw  ms/k,

the naive gauge theory picture is clearly correct at low energies, and the low lying spectrum
includes k1 scalar elds with so(2) charge 1. as mw increases and eventually passes ms,
the theory develops a strong coupling regime at energies ms/k < e < mw . thus, it is
possible that some operators which are irrelevant at weak coupling become relevant in this
energy regime11, and cause the theory to ow to a dierent xed point in which the number

of massless degrees of freedom is the same (due to supersymmetry) but they have dierent

11 such operators are known as dangerously irrelevant in the general theory of the renormal-

ization group.

18

quantum numbers. examples of such behavior are known to occur in supersymmetric

gauge theories (see e.g. [27]).

for n  0 (4.18), the factor g(j1  j2  j3  1) in (4.7) has a pole (see (4.8), (4.18)).
the integral (4.14) supplies the other two poles in (4.17). it can be evaluated by noting
that the integrand of (4.14) is a polynomial in |1  x2|. one expands

|1  x2|2n =

(b.1)

and uses (a.2) to evaluate (4.14). requiring that this integral has poles at the locations
(4.16) constrains n, m in (b.1) to lie in the interval n + 1  n2  n, m  n3  1 (and of
course (b.1) 0  n, m  n ). after some algebra, this leads to (4.20). the other factors in
(4.19) arise from (4.7) by substituting (4.15), (4.16) and using (4.8).

19

to show that the on-shell matrix elements vanish for n < 0, one rst notes that the

function d(j3, j2, j1; k) (4.7) contributes no poles in this case. the factor g(n ) in (4.7)
is non-singular, since for negative arguments g(j) does not have poles for j > k  1 and
one can show that in the regime (2.6), n > k  1
2 . the factor g(j1  j2  j3  2) can
become singular for j1 + j2 + j3  k  1, however, as explained in section 4 (see (4.11))
this regime is excluded by unitarity, or alternatively applicability of weakly coupled string

theory. the remaining two factors in the numerator of (4.7) have some poles, but those
correspond to processes like 2  1 + 3 or 3  1 + 2.

thus, to get a non-zero matrix element for n < 0 one needs to generate all three

poles (4.17) from the integrals (4.14). an explicit calculation shows that one can get at

most two.
