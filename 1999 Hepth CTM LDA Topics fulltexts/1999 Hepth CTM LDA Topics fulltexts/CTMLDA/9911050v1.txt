i show that the method of nding if the ground state energy is nonzero
or not by saturating the functional integral directly with instanton-anti-
instanton type uctuations is not reliable either for the double or for the
triple well potential models in supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

in the last few years, supersymmetry (susy) has attracted lot of atten-
tion as it appears to cure the gauge hierarchy problem in the grand unied
theories. if susy has anything to do with nature, it is clear that it must
be a badly broken symmetry. there are reasons to believe that susy may
be broken dynamically by nonperturbative uctuations rather than sponta-
neously at the tree level. it may therefore be worthwhile to understand the
mechanism responsible for dynamical susy breaking.

sometime ago, witten [1] conjectured that instantons may be responsi-
ble for the dynamical susy breaking. since it is not very easy to study this
question for eld theoretic models in 3+1 dimensions, many workers have
studied it in susy quantum mechanics. witten and specially salomonson
and van holten [2] have discussed the celebrated x2x4 double well potential
which has one instanton and have shown that susy is indeed dynamically
broken in this example. later on, cooper and freedman [3] have shown
that instantons are not necessary for the susy breaking by considering a
x4-potential. however, the real surprise came when abbott and zakrzewski
[4] showed that instantons are not even sucient for susy breaking.
in
particular, they discussed the potential x2  x4  x6 having symmetric triple
well [5] and showed that even though there are two instantons in this model
still susy is unbroken. this counter example made it clear that the connec-
tion between instantons and dynamical susy breaking, if any, is not that
straight forward [6].

in a recent paper, kaul and mizrachi [7] have reexamined this question
and oered an explanation as to why susy is dynamically broken for the
x2  x4 potential with double well while it is unbroken for the triple well
case (x2  x4  x6). these authors saturated the functional integral directly
with instanton-antiinstanton type uctuations and showed that whereas in
the double well case the ground state energy is raised by these uctuations, in
the triple well case it is not. according to these authors, their formalism can
be easily generalized to eld theoretical models in higher dimensions. in view
of these attractive features, it may be worthwhile to critically analyze this
approach. in particular, one would like to know if the approach gives reliable
result for any double or triple well potential model or not. further, it would
appear from the work of kaul and mizrachi [7] that whereas susy would be
dynamically broken for any double well potential, it would remain unbroken
for any triple well case. is this conjecture really true ? unfortunately, as i
show below the answer to all these questions is no. in particular, i oer

concrete examples with double and triple well potentials and show that in
both cases this method leads to wrong conclusion regarding the question of
susy breaking. i also show that unbroken or broken susy has nothing to
do with the triple or double well structure of the potential.

the minkowaskian action for a supersymmetric classical particle is given

by

am =

1

2 z dt[ x2  s 2(x) + it   s(x)t 2] ,

(1)

where s(x) denotes the derivative with respect to its argument x, x means
derivative with respect to time t while  is a two-component anticommut-
ing variable. note that this action is invariant under the supersymmetric
transformation

x = t 2,  = [i2 x  s(x)], t = t [i2 x  s(x)] .

let us rst consider the following double well potential

while a is an arbitrary parameter. in order that v has a double well structure
it is necessary that 0 < a < 9/8. this ensures that  2 is always positive. in
fact, if one had chosen a = 9/8 then  2 = 0 and the potential (3) reduces to
the symmetric triple well of [7]. for 0 < a < 9/8, the potential (3) has two

classical ground states denoted by  > corresponding to x = m/ and

 = 0. note that for these ground states the classical vacuum energy is zero
so that susy remains unbroken at the tree level. what about dynamical
susy breaking because of nonperturbative eects ? since for this model,
asymptotically s  x3 hence a la witten [1] it follows that susy remains
unbroken in this model.
let us now try to follow the arguments of [7] and see if by saturating
the functional integral directly with instanton-antiinstanton type uctuations
one would arrive at the same conclusion or not. for the double well potential
(3) there is one instanton and one antiinstanton solution given by [8]  = 0

now one can essentially run through the arguments of [7]. as is well known,
single instanton or antiinstanton will not contribute to the vacuum functional
integral because of the zero modes of the relevant fermion determinant ob-
tained by integrating over fermionic degrees of freedom. however, instanton-
antiinstanton congurations will contribute since there are no exact fermionic
zero modes for such congurations. by following through the arguments of
[7] one can calculate the lowest order eect from such uctuations and one
nds that one has two ground states with equal energies given by

< + | h | + >=<  | h |  >

e2a0/h ,

(11)

where a0 is as given by eq. (9). thus, according to this approach, to the
lowest order, susy is dynamically broken which is contrary to the exact
result that susy is unbroken for the potential (3). this counter example
clearly demonstrates that the method of [7] is not reliable for double well
potentials. further it also shown that susy need not necessarily be broken
for double well potentials.

it may be worthwhile to point out that for the potential (3) if one had
instead followed the approach of [2] and calculated the single instanton in-
duced vacuum expectation values of susy generators then also one would
have arrived at the wrong conclusion that susy is dynamically broken for
this model.

let us now turn to the case of the triple well potentials and enquire about
the reliability of the approach proposed in [7]. let us consider the following
triple well potential

v

2

s 2 =

3x2
2m4 (x2 

m2


)2(x2 +

m2


) .

(12)



the potential (12) has three classical ground states denoted by | + >, |  >
and | 0 > corresponding to x = +m/, m
, 0 respectively (and  = 0).
note that the vacuum energy is zero for all these ground states so that susy
is unbroken at the tree level. what about dynamical susy breaking ? since
asymptotically s  x4 hence a 1a witten [1] it follows that the ground state
energy e0 > 0 and hence susy is dynamically broken in this model.
let us now follow the approach of [7] and see if by saturating the func-
tional integral directly with non-perturbative uctuations one arrives at the
same conclusion or not. for the triple well potential (12) it is clear that
there will be two types of instantons which will interpolate between the clas-
sical ground states x = 0 and x = m
and x = 0 as t

goes from   to t   respectively. similarly there will be two types
of antiinstantons which will interpolate between the classical ground states
and x = 0 as well as x = 0 and x = m/ as t goes from   to
x = m

t   respectively. the action for all these instantons and antiinstantons
is the same:

as well as x =  m


a0 =

single instanton or antiinstanton again does not contribute to the vacuum
functional integral because of the fermionic zero modes. the possible next
order contribution to the vacuum functional integral will again come from
instanton-antiinstanton congurations. in this case, there will also be con-
tributions from two instantons and two antiinstantons representing quantum
tunneling from |  > to | + > and | + > to |  >. one can calculate the
lowest order eect from such vacuum uctuations by following the approach
of [7]. one would then nd that to the lowest order

so that

to the same order. here a0 is as given by eq.(13). hence to the lowest order,
the hamiltonian matrix for the low-lying states can be written as

h = 


x
x 0
0 2x 0
x 0
x

.




(17)

the matrix has a zero eigenvalue and two equal non-zero eigenvalues. thus
according to the approach of [7], to the lowest order, susy is not dynam-
ically broken in this model which is contrary to the exact result. thus the
approach of [7] does not give reliable answers for the triple well potentials
either. further, this counter example also demonstrates that susy need not
necessarily be unbroken for triple well potentials.

summarizing, it appears that the approach of [7] at least in its present
form, does not give reliable answers for either the double or the triple well
potentials. perhaps, it is not enough to calculate the contributions from
widely separated instantons and antiinstanton but one must also include
the contribution from their mutual interactions. clearly much more work is
necessary in order to clarify the connection between instantons and dynamical
susy breaking.
